[00:00.000 --> 00:23.440]  Rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty it's Alex Jones
[00:23.440 --> 00:35.040]  Ladies and gentlemen it's already September 12th 2017 on this Tuesday global broadcast
[00:35.040 --> 00:40.600]  we have five different very informative guests joining us today we've got some very good news
[00:40.600 --> 00:47.960]  Census Bureau shows median income climbs for the first time since 2007 which previously was
[00:47.960 --> 00:55.840]  the highest level for the median income so great again incomes are up the Trump effect is in
[00:55.840 --> 01:03.280]  effect but all is not well ladies and gentlemen up in Rapunzel's castle report McMaster labeled
[01:03.280 --> 01:09.320]  Trump's scary and a dope deep state drugging Trump ahead of coup sources say well sources are
[01:09.320 --> 01:15.320]  questioning and our reports yesterday got picked up obviously all over TV radio and print yesterday
[01:15.320 --> 01:23.240]  and distorted the big news is that Keith Schiller almost 30 year closest confidant to Trump resigned
[01:23.240 --> 01:28.040]  and Trump didn't even know it was happening because he couldn't even get into see Trump for
[01:28.040 --> 01:35.760]  days I mean this is total isolation this isn't command and control this is a deep state coup
[01:35.760 --> 01:40.600]  of another type yeah we didn't want the deep state coup of Hillary and austerity and gun
[01:40.600 --> 01:47.080]  confiscation and race war but we trade that out now for another deep state and I'll say this
[01:47.080 --> 01:56.680]  Americans white black Christian whatever don't go and try to lobby for political control but
[01:56.680 --> 02:00.680]  if you look at the camps trying to lobby for control inside the White House right now there's
[02:00.680 --> 02:06.720]  a giant Islamist Wahhabist camp through McMaster and a bunch of arabists basically is what it's
[02:06.720 --> 02:11.920]  called at the State Department that's westerners that have kind of gone native and and bought
[02:11.920 --> 02:17.040]  into the whole Islamic takeover plan usually for money and then you've got the Israel lobby in
[02:17.040 --> 02:24.000]  there fighting as well and I don't like either side being involved but those are the factions
[02:24.000 --> 02:30.560]  because the American people are on the sidelines not politically aware politically ignorant so
[02:30.560 --> 02:38.160]  we're going to be discussing all of this coming up ladies and gentlemen but right now it's the
[02:38.160 --> 02:43.280]  Israel lobby the conservative Israel lobby there's more than one that is backing the tax cuts
[02:43.280 --> 02:50.400]  backing the basic Trump agenda and you see the whole Islamic through the culture even through
[02:50.400 --> 02:58.160]  Hollywood anti-Israel propaganda has become like mother's milk in this country and it shows
[02:58.160 --> 03:02.800]  how the Islamist's brainwashing has worked so incredibly well and I'm not saying Israel
[03:02.800 --> 03:07.600]  is perfect Israel's got big problems diverse politics are trying to indict Netanyahu and
[03:07.600 --> 03:14.160]  his wife right now the same stuff they're doing to Trump just know this just know this there's
[03:14.160 --> 03:18.640]  large elements of the Israel lobby trying to stabilize the United States and actually trying
[03:18.640 --> 03:23.440]  to stop the complete race war overthrow of the country because see George Soros that came out
[03:23.440 --> 03:30.560]  in documents last year and WikiLeaks and others that he wants to overthrow Israel so Israel finally
[03:30.560 --> 03:36.080]  gets it that okay they want to overthrow Israel they want to overthrow the US they want to overthrow
[03:36.080 --> 03:43.360]  free market and what replace it with a bunch of Muslims killing each other so I've been studying
[03:43.360 --> 03:51.680]  this you've got the the weird communist pope faction you've got the EU socialist bureaucrat
[03:51.680 --> 03:57.360]  banker faction and then you've got the US Anglo-American faction with the UK I mean these
[03:57.360 --> 04:02.720]  are the different power structures and they're all fighting for control meanwhile Trump comes in
[04:02.720 --> 04:06.720]  is just trying to stabilize the economy and not have a global depression and it's starting to work
[04:07.280 --> 04:13.200]  and that's why everybody hates him in the establishment because they're not in control the
[04:13.200 --> 04:18.560]  people got a beachhead in Washington and they'd rather see everything go to hell in a hand basket
[04:18.560 --> 04:23.440]  and everything collapse as long as they're in charge of it better to reign in hell than serve in
[04:23.440 --> 04:30.000]  heaven and so it's the same old power struggle over who controls the winehouse I didn't go to
[04:30.000 --> 04:36.320]  DC or New York or LA to build an operation against the globalist I did it in Texas I don't want to
[04:36.320 --> 04:41.680]  go drink wine and hang around with a bunch of folks and decide I've arrived and try to be part of
[04:41.680 --> 04:48.720]  the power structure I want to overthrow the corrupt globalist system and restore the republic I want
[04:48.720 --> 04:55.280]  to change the world not be part of the sick of fan drop in Washington DC so all you bureaucrats and
[04:55.280 --> 05:01.920]  generals and all you you get that through your head you know someone very profoundly once said
[05:01.920 --> 05:12.880]  many years ago that if fascism ever comes to America it'll come in the name of liberalism

[08:26.160 --> 08:32.880]  there is mass looting going on all over the eastern caribbean and the u.s virgin islands the british
[08:32.880 --> 08:42.000]  virgin islands and in french possessions as well there is mass looting going on all over florida
[08:43.600 --> 08:48.640]  and there had been a rest all over florida if you tabulate all of them together it's got to
[08:48.640 --> 08:53.200]  be in the hundreds yesterday it was 19 booked confirmed arrest but if you look at all the
[08:53.200 --> 08:58.320]  arrest and all the articles i have in counties and cities all over florida it is in the hundreds
[08:58.320 --> 09:03.680]  but the police have been doing a pretty good job along with citizens clamping down on it
[09:03.680 --> 09:08.480]  very very quickly anarchy in the streets of a hurricane irma frees prisoners
[09:11.040 --> 09:16.960]  frees prisoners and sparks mass looting there's your headline out of the metro
[09:17.840 --> 09:23.600]  show we're going to be chronicling all of this coming up here in just a few minutes and notice
[09:23.600 --> 09:30.080]  that people that cover the looting are being called racist because when you look at the videos
[09:30.080 --> 09:41.520]  from the caribbean to florida it is to a person to a person black folks florida looting crackdown
[09:41.520 --> 09:49.680]  is white supremacy claims author sarah jaffe that's fox news show dan bongino former secret
[09:49.680 --> 09:56.240]  service agent new york cop says yes now it's apparently racist give you point of camera
[09:56.240 --> 10:02.160]  who's committing a crime now think about this that scumbag that went into that black church last year
[10:04.880 --> 10:11.920]  roof and shot and killed nine people the media said all white people were guilty for that no
[10:11.920 --> 10:17.280]  we're not and if a minority of black people have been culturally trained and taught
[10:17.280 --> 10:23.840]  to go out and loot and rob during a crisis you don't blame the majority of black folks either
[10:23.840 --> 10:30.720]  but you certainly don't blame any group for what other folks do but you've got to ask why is it in
[10:30.720 --> 10:37.200]  the la riots you name it predominantly black folks and it's because culturally it was sold
[10:37.200 --> 10:45.440]  as a form of rebellion in the 50s and 60s by communist teaching through agitator propaganda
[10:45.440 --> 10:50.880]  that going out and looting and stealing and killing white people is an act of rebellion
[10:50.880 --> 10:55.680]  and revolution we've had him on the show before the head of the black panther party new black
[10:55.680 --> 11:01.600]  panther party houston he's been in a houston chronicle you can search it saying don't loot
[11:01.600 --> 11:10.080]  in the black area go loot in the white area go rob go mug white people as an act of resistance
[11:10.080 --> 11:17.280]  so this is the systemic cultural racism that's being pushed by the left and the ford foundation
[11:17.280 --> 11:21.200]  of the universities where they say oh we're gonna have a weekend with no white people at the college
[11:21.200 --> 11:26.880]  and we're going to have no white people allowed on the commons area this weekend to teach you
[11:26.880 --> 11:33.920]  about discrimination when only less than one percent of descendants of this country's family
[11:33.920 --> 11:39.280]  ancestors had slaves and most white people didn't get here till after the civil war and have no
[11:39.280 --> 11:44.160]  connection to it a lot of them came from eastern europe and western europe where they were still
[11:44.160 --> 11:52.320]  serfs sharecroppers tied to the land slaves who could be locked up in the stocks and whipped if
[11:52.320 --> 11:58.080]  they didn't do their work just like black slaves there were some areas of germania the austrian
[11:58.080 --> 12:04.560]  hungarian empire that didn't end slavery in germany until the 1880s what let me test my memory
[12:04.560 --> 12:11.760]  when was serfdom abolished in the little final states in austrian hungarian empire 1882 look it
[12:11.760 --> 12:17.200]  up let's see if my memory serves when was serfdom abolished in the austrian hungarian empire
[12:18.640 --> 12:25.280]  1880s let's see if my memory serves i think it's 1882 and then it was illegally carried out somewhere
[12:25.280 --> 12:33.520]  until i think 1890 but but i mean the point is that's never taught there it is and the austrian empire
[12:33.520 --> 12:40.480]  serfdom was abolished in 1781 serfdom cafe until 1848 serfdom was abolished in russia in the 1860s
[12:40.480 --> 12:46.000]  and the united nations 1956 civil and terry convention on abolition of slavery also prohibit
[12:46.000 --> 12:50.960]  serfdom as a form of slavery okay well that's a general wikipedia if you go to the last what was
[12:50.960 --> 12:57.360]  the last germanic kingdom because they were all little states to abolish serfdom and it was it
[12:57.360 --> 13:04.320]  was in the 1880s because they had to have a big almost a war over it just to stop it but again
[13:04.320 --> 13:11.280]  people don't know this is going on that russia didn't abolish it till 1860 they don't understand
[13:11.280 --> 13:17.440]  that they just think it's something going on in america slavery's still happening in africa it's
[13:17.440 --> 13:22.400]  still happening in the middle east in some areas they still have sex slaves in the middle east they're
[13:22.400 --> 13:27.440]  called harems they always hear about women getting tricked to fly over to saudi arabia and they never
[13:27.440 --> 13:35.440]  come back they get chained up in a sex dungeon then they get killed but that's okay just beat
[13:35.440 --> 13:41.680]  america and the west over the head telling everybody that we invented slavery you know who the romans
[13:41.680 --> 13:48.400]  favorite slaves were people out of gall and people out of germania and in all those areas they were
[13:48.400 --> 13:53.600]  the slaves being brought in not africans there have been more white slaves in european history
[13:53.600 --> 13:57.840]  that there have been black slaves and i'm not defending any of it but i didn't have anything to
[13:57.840 --> 14:03.680]  do with it if my great great granddaddy was a murderer which he wasn't i'm not guilty of that
[14:04.240 --> 14:09.360]  if my daddy kills somebody i'm not guilty if your daddy does something wrong you're not guilty for
[14:09.360 --> 14:21.360]  what your mama did but you've got people getting totally absolutely brainwashed to sit there and
[14:21.360 --> 14:31.600]  to believe that they have a right to go out and engage in these type of activities and they don't
[14:33.440 --> 14:37.600]  that's the bottom line and if you look at where serfdom got abolished first it was christian
[14:37.600 --> 14:44.720]  countries but see i'm cursed with actually having facts so let's go over it this is on info wars dot
[14:44.720 --> 14:51.760]  com it's on news wars dot com a dan lineman article bandits terrorizing virgin islands
[14:51.760 --> 14:56.880]  after governor seized private arms i remember last week i remember seeing the headlines that the
[14:56.880 --> 15:03.440]  virgin islands had seized private arms from private hunting clubs and people's private homes that had
[15:03.440 --> 15:10.240]  registered them under laws passed more than a decade ago so in the emergency they said turn
[15:10.240 --> 15:17.920]  your guns in and the law abiding citizens turned their guns in and then what happened the criminals
[15:17.920 --> 15:27.360]  went absolutely crazy reports are exploding now from the u.s virgin islands that armed marauders
[15:27.360 --> 15:37.280]  are looting and robbing residents in the chaos following hurricane irma days after usvi governor
[15:37.280 --> 15:43.040]  keith map ordered the national guard to seize farms and weapons before the storm that is a
[15:43.040 --> 15:49.680]  close quote that was an order issued member katrina i remember when i first was getting reports
[15:49.680 --> 15:55.280]  during katrina that they were confiscating guns all over the city the media said i was a conspiracy
[15:55.280 --> 15:59.440]  theorist because they wanted to see if they could get away with giving the military the order
[16:00.240 --> 16:05.280]  and then if they could contain the information and control it but then people started complaining
[16:05.280 --> 16:09.760]  news crews started showing the gun confiscation of people in their high and dry homes protecting
[16:09.760 --> 16:15.760]  their property and so they had the police chief come out and say quote all the firearms will be
[16:15.760 --> 16:22.160]  taken no one will be allowed to be armed if you have them you will turn them in we're coming in
[16:22.160 --> 16:29.200]  your house and you must evacuate and they went into the big rich dry areas under homeland security
[16:29.200 --> 16:35.040]  bipartisanly with the fbi leading it and stole hundreds of thousands of firearms
[16:37.120 --> 16:42.720]  looters armed with machetes guns ransack hotels in st martine after hurricane irma
[16:44.960 --> 16:51.600]  so the british possessions the u.s possessions the french possessions they're all getting robbed
[16:51.600 --> 16:57.120]  you survived irma but now you're in a civil war that's the headlines we just had on screen
[16:58.720 --> 17:02.880]  why is there an instinct in government to take our guns let's but but let's roll
[17:02.880 --> 17:07.360]  some of the footage from fort lauderdale and miami and all the other footage is coming out
[17:07.360 --> 17:14.640]  for tv viewers and from all over the caribbean as well
[17:14.640 --> 17:22.640]  of the looting that's going on and then if you point out that in fort lauderdale and miami
[17:23.200 --> 17:30.880]  and in orlando that every person looting is black you're racist in fact they're even saying
[17:30.880 --> 17:37.040]  showing it is racist or other leftist groups are spitting it that well they need supplies
[17:37.040 --> 17:46.080]  but you need nine pairs of size 12 nike tennis shoes it's also part of the sports
[17:46.080 --> 17:51.840]  brainwashing culture where you're nobody if you don't have the three hundred dollar pair
[17:51.840 --> 17:57.680]  of tennis shoes it's nothing but status nothing wrong with a good pair of tennis shoes but it's
[17:57.680 --> 18:07.360]  disgusting to see people robbing stealing and doing this and if you saw nothing but white people running
[18:07.360 --> 18:13.760]  around robbing and marauding and in many areas with guns and machetes and everything else you
[18:13.760 --> 18:18.720]  would hear collectively that whites are the devil that whites are inherently bad in fact it gets worse
[18:19.680 --> 18:24.080]  this isn't just an attack on the west or white people by the globalist to create division
[18:24.080 --> 18:31.920]  targeting low income people that are susceptible to getting into tribalism and brainwashing
[18:33.040 --> 18:37.200]  is all poor groups are more susceptible towards racism and tribalism and the democrats are
[18:37.200 --> 18:42.880]  manipulating it we have diane feinstein
[18:42.880 --> 18:58.080]  and people of her ilk the michael moors of the world coming out and saying if you're a christian
[18:58.080 --> 19:06.880]  if you're an evangelical uh if you are a Mormon uh if you are a catholic you can't be trusted in
[19:06.880 --> 19:14.800]  the judiciary those clips are coming up after the break can you imagine if someone said to
[19:14.800 --> 19:20.720]  someone like ruth better ginsberg who's jewish can you be a judge because you're jewish and
[19:20.720 --> 19:24.800]  your jewish dogma or saying it to a hindu or a buddhist
[19:27.200 --> 19:32.560]  feinstein's anti-catholic questions are an outrage it shows you that's bloomberg
[19:32.560 --> 19:39.760]  it shows you the mindset though on capitol hill and in california the anti-christian venom
[19:41.120 --> 19:48.160]  is so extravagant that they think it's safe and it's not just her i have clips of three senators
[19:49.200 --> 19:57.600]  all attacking this judge set to go to a higher level court viciously for being a catholic

[24:30.080 --> 24:34.320]  we got a lot of really serious news to cover but one of the top stories out there right now
[24:34.320 --> 24:41.360]  it's at real alex jones on twitter and viewer discretion is advised we're putting it out obviously
[24:41.360 --> 24:47.760]  only so people can see the horrible thing that ted cruz has done senator ted cruz has tweeted
[24:47.760 --> 24:51.840]  out some hardcore porn uh and of course he's probably gonna get a lot of trouble because it's
[24:51.840 --> 24:59.280]  not gay porn or or or child porn uh it's just uh get old-fashioned healthy women but uh i'm not a
[24:59.280 --> 25:06.080]  hypocrite and i'm not a Pharisee folks uh i'm not a big uh you know purveyor kind of serve things
[25:06.080 --> 25:10.960]  like that i i like the real world i'm not into virtual stuff but uh here's the deal he's tweeted
[25:10.960 --> 25:18.240]  out some hardcore porn to his three million followers from sexual post and uh i have uh reviewed
[25:19.200 --> 25:26.800]  the materiale and i hope this doesn't destroy him because he does a lot of good up there
[25:26.800 --> 25:33.840]  but he he he does kind of put on the whole holier than now attitude and and and and and
[25:33.840 --> 25:38.400]  there's been reports of porn before and him connected to the you know different groups
[25:38.400 --> 25:42.960]  and organizations and people that are involved in the production of it uh so college roommate
[25:42.960 --> 25:48.400]  really wants us to know that ted cruz is a serial masturbator that is the report we're
[25:48.400 --> 25:55.920]  tweeting that out on real alex jones because i need some humor here with all the serious news
[25:55.920 --> 26:02.640]  in fact i'm gonna come back and get into diane feinstein who looks like i'm serious i was watching
[26:02.640 --> 26:08.000]  the clips this morning of her yesterday grilling this federal judge and saying you're a catholic
[26:08.000 --> 26:11.280]  you have such extreme dogma you know can you be on the bench it's so bigoted
[26:13.440 --> 26:18.800]  it's so out of touch but frankenstein doesn't get it because he's in her own little hollywood
[26:18.800 --> 26:24.640]  bubble but i'm serious diane feinstein is the most masculine looking woman i've ever seen like
[26:24.640 --> 26:32.560]  she's she's got a head just like frankenstein i mean if you look up at her when she's on the
[26:32.560 --> 26:37.360]  dies and she's talking she looks like frankenstein i'm not i'm not against her because she looks
[26:37.360 --> 26:45.920]  like frankenstein but she's just a weirdo but i digress very hateful very very serious and
[26:49.520 --> 26:53.600]  what you gotta understand and what nobody else is covering at least from what i've seen
[26:53.600 --> 26:58.320]  is that there were two other senators that said stuff just as bad
[27:00.320 --> 27:03.600]  so that's coming up in the next segment but let's get back to ted cruz
[27:05.520 --> 27:11.520]  i probably got 10 different staffers that are on my twitter real alex jumps so they can retweet
[27:11.520 --> 27:18.720]  stories and feeds paul watson's on my twitter i'm on his twitter but if somebody tweeted because
[27:18.720 --> 27:26.880]  this happened i guess last night if somebody tweeted porn on my twitter i'd find out about it i'd say
[27:26.880 --> 27:33.040]  we discovered who did it they've been fired or they get in trouble or whatever or you know somebody
[27:33.040 --> 27:39.760]  did it it's an accident because i've accidentally deleted tweets i've i've sent tweets before
[27:39.760 --> 27:43.920]  stuff i didn't mean to them it'd be like some random story about a volcano actually tweeted
[27:43.920 --> 27:48.400]  like a month ago because i was looking at that story sending it to the crew thought i was pasting
[27:48.400 --> 27:52.880]  an end to a text message and was putting it into a tweet you know not paying attention
[27:52.880 --> 27:58.160]  literally sitting there in a grocery store parking lot uh with my kids getting buckled into the car
[27:58.160 --> 28:04.880]  and i was sent out a tweet on accident so that may be what it is from ted cruz but the fact that
[28:05.520 --> 28:11.440]  i was just looking during the break have we gotten a response from ted cruz on tweeting out reality
[28:11.440 --> 28:19.040]  kings uh i guess his fantasy is the wife comes home and catches you with another woman and then
[28:19.040 --> 28:26.080]  a wife gets involved because that's i i guess what ted cruz is looking at and watching the problem
[28:26.080 --> 28:33.360]  here is that again we haven't had the repudiation from ted cruz that someone hacked into his twitter
[28:33.360 --> 28:40.240]  remember what weiner said remember weiner said that somebody hacked into it was his twitter and
[28:40.240 --> 28:44.640]  it was all over just sending out the sexting pictures and pictures of him standing naked in front of
[28:44.640 --> 28:52.720]  the mirror i mean do we have another anthony weiner on our hands oh yeah kirke i can walled the
[28:52.720 --> 28:58.720]  tentacle porn that's where monsters and goblins rape and murder men women and children but it's
[28:58.720 --> 29:05.280]  not illegal because it's it's anime and then he had that on his screen he's a big uh i guess tv
[29:05.280 --> 29:12.160]  contributor to uh establishment media twitter explodes that recurke i can wall allegedly tweets
[29:12.160 --> 29:18.160]  photo that shows his interest in anime porn uh actually it was tentacle porn which i didn't
[29:18.160 --> 29:25.200]  really know about until i did the research and let me tell you it's horrific i had seen one image
[29:25.200 --> 29:31.360]  like years ago or something on facebook of like alien from the movie aliens raping a woman and
[29:31.360 --> 29:35.520]  ripping her head off and i thought you know i really think this is disgusting i didn't know that was
[29:35.520 --> 29:40.480]  known as tentacle porn but what does it surprise you that that's what these guys are into they want
[29:40.480 --> 29:46.320]  power over people so is it is it a good thing ted cruz just likes women i mean in this corrupt age
[29:46.320 --> 29:54.240]  is it i mean is that a plus we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio
[29:54.240 --> 30:05.280]  network jobix here with info wars dot com today i want to talk to you about guns why we have them
[30:05.280 --> 30:10.880]  why the bill of rights guarantees that we can have them and why my right to have a gun is more
[30:10.880 --> 30:16.400]  important than your right to rail against it in the press i believe every good journalist needs to
[30:16.400 --> 30:21.680]  know why the second amendment must be considered more essential than the first amendment this may
[30:21.680 --> 30:28.320]  be a bitter pill to swallow but the right to keep and bear arms is not an outdated dusty idea some
[30:28.320 --> 30:34.640]  old dead white guys dreamed up in fear of the redcoats no it is just as essential to liberty today
[30:34.640 --> 30:40.720]  as it was in 1776 the original amendments we refer to as the bill of rights contained in
[30:40.720 --> 30:46.960]  of what the constitutional framers termed unalienable rights the bill of rights came to us with blinders
[30:46.960 --> 30:53.360]  on it doesn't recognize color or class or wealth it protects not just the rights of actors or editors
[30:53.360 --> 30:58.800]  or reporters but extends even to those we love to hate this is a small excerpt from trawlton
[30:58.800 --> 31:03.680]  heston it's not just our water we need to filter it's not just our food that needs to be cleaned

[33:33.440 --> 33:39.440]  broadcasting worldwide it's alex john all right i'm going to get into the latest on
[33:39.440 --> 33:44.800]  hurricane irma the looting and rioting going on all over the caribbean and the u.s virgin
[33:44.800 --> 33:50.320]  islands british virgin islands french islands as well but a lot of it happening in florida
[33:50.320 --> 33:58.320]  and the fact that florida looting crackdown is white supremacy that's fox news reporting
[33:58.320 --> 34:04.560]  that that's what the left is saying now this is a big controversy and the and the reason i'm
[34:04.560 --> 34:11.280]  going to weigh into it is it's very illustrative of hypocrisy last night someone on ted cruz's
[34:11.280 --> 34:18.800]  twitter account three million followers tweeted out reality king's porn straight porn of i guess
[34:18.800 --> 34:23.680]  a girlfriend coming home to the house and finding her boyfriend her husband with another woman
[34:23.680 --> 34:27.760]  and then she jumps in on it we're not going to show the porn here but this we're showing
[34:27.760 --> 34:36.560]  your screenshots of his official twitter page three million followers and uh we've gone and
[34:36.560 --> 34:43.120]  checked it was officially tweeted out we have we have reviewed the video now i'm serious when i say this
[34:43.120 --> 34:50.080]  they're making all these jokes that ted cruz has now damaged the credibility of the porn industry
[34:50.080 --> 34:57.760]  that is um their hollywood exploitive joke and there's also the joke that one of my crew made
[34:57.760 --> 35:03.040]  that at least these are good-looking women that he tweeted out uh not to be mean or anything but the
[35:03.040 --> 35:12.080]  woman that anthony weiner was sexting the underage girl looks like ted cruz so there's a lot of weird
[35:12.080 --> 35:18.080]  connections here but the big issue is this he did not tweet out images of his naked body
[35:19.120 --> 35:25.760]  out to folks like weiner did he did not call an underage girl and try to set her up for sex
[35:26.720 --> 35:33.280]  and he did not tweet out child porn and he didn't tweet out any other kind of porn that's probably
[35:33.280 --> 35:39.280]  why he's gonna get in a big trouble because he committed the crime of heterosexuality now we're
[35:39.280 --> 35:47.040]  not sure that he did this one of his staffers one of his crew was probably going through it but
[35:47.040 --> 35:52.720]  how do you hit like and tweet on something you know there's a couple buttons you gotta hit
[35:52.720 --> 35:57.920]  and i think somebody thought they were on their personal account and tweeted this out and i don't
[35:57.920 --> 36:06.560]  think ted cruz did this though his roommate and others say he is a porn addict uh and uh also was
[36:06.560 --> 36:15.680]  pun intended a master debater he is a master debater but his roommate says he was the other type of
[36:15.680 --> 36:23.680]  master so we're gonna be discussing all of this more coming up because quite frankly i need a good
[36:23.680 --> 36:32.160]  laugh without serious some of the news is but i don't think ted cruz should uh get thrown under the
[36:32.160 --> 36:38.480]  bus for this or most of us here are hypocrites uh but expanding on that quite frankly that's not what
[36:38.480 --> 36:42.240]  i'm doing on the computer that's not what i'm doing on twitter that would never happen to me
[36:42.240 --> 36:48.560]  because i'm not doing that on my twitter unless one of my crew members did it but you can be assured
[36:49.120 --> 36:54.880]  that uh i think if that did happen on twitter it might be some of the same stuff cruz is tweeting
[36:54.880 --> 37:02.000]  out okay this is just too rich we've got so much serious news to get to though coming up bandits
[37:02.000 --> 37:07.520]  terrorizing virgin islands after governor sees private arms that's a u.s governor of the virgin
[37:07.520 --> 37:12.880]  islands he should be removed french caribbean fear and looting grip tense st martins in wake
[37:12.880 --> 37:20.080]  of hurricane ermah violence on caribbean islands as food gone looters run wild looting and lawlessness
[37:20.080 --> 37:25.920]  in caribbean after ermah barrels through again all the video you've seen for days of fort lauderdale
[37:25.920 --> 37:32.320]  and miami and and now we've got a bunch of footage and photos here uh out of more of the central area
[37:32.960 --> 37:40.160]  of the state with orlando and of course the looting going on in the caribbean as well and i'm not
[37:40.160 --> 37:46.160]  kidding there's foxes right here the left is calling it racist uh if you show the video just like the
[37:46.160 --> 37:52.640]  left won't show crime statistics that on average every white person attacks a black person 10 times
[37:52.640 --> 37:56.480]  less often than a black person attacks a white person it's still a very small minority of black
[37:56.480 --> 38:01.360]  folks that are super racist out there attacking white people it's just the facts are in that
[38:01.360 --> 38:07.040]  culturally the media has promoted go out knock a cracker in the head with a baseball bat if you're
[38:07.040 --> 38:11.440]  gonna loot the new black panther party says all over the country they say at austin they say in
[38:11.440 --> 38:22.720]  austin it's been on the news go out and loot in a white area and so let's admit there there's racism
[38:22.720 --> 38:27.440]  from whites there's racism from blacks and used to we had big institutional racism in some areas
[38:27.440 --> 38:33.360]  and the kkk would go out and rob and steal and hurt black people that was wrong we said it was wrong
[38:33.360 --> 38:39.280]  now blacks are doing it and it's not acceptable it's culturally being pushed and the racism is on
[38:39.280 --> 38:45.760]  the part of the left pushing it saying it's okay to go out and get yours go out and loot because
[38:45.760 --> 38:50.160]  it's acceptable you look at new orleans where we even had cops going through and stealing stuff at
[38:50.160 --> 38:56.400]  walmart and it was again because culturally well they're rich and you know we're poor it's this class
[38:56.400 --> 39:01.040]  envy thing that you're not going to get anything in life unless you steal it and then after roger
[39:01.040 --> 39:05.360]  stone leaves us with big breaking news i'm going to play the video series it wasn't just one senator
[39:05.360 --> 39:17.200]  it has been three senators we have mazy hirano attacking the judge saying you can't be caval you
[39:17.200 --> 39:22.080]  can't be christian and be on the bench we've got dick durbin saying it and then of course feinstein
[39:22.080 --> 39:28.480]  saying it so the anti christian fervor whether you're hispanic black white asian old young
[39:28.480 --> 39:33.360]  that's the real global discrimination is against christianity and against real religious freedom
[39:33.360 --> 39:38.880]  and against western civilization we should all come together globalism is destroying the nation state

[43:06.880 --> 43:12.880]  whatever you do everywhere you've got to fight for the info war because we're winning we're having
[43:12.880 --> 43:17.680]  a huge effect we're changing the world together but they're trying to shut us down and in the face
[43:17.680 --> 43:24.720]  of that we're swimming upstream and still winning but it is an uphill battle here's an example google
[43:24.720 --> 43:28.960]  admits and it's come out in their own documents that they try to delist info wars and try to block
[43:28.960 --> 43:34.240]  us because in almost every search result our stories until about a year ago were number one
[43:34.240 --> 43:40.320]  whatever the topic was when you typed in info info wars was the top thing and so they'd been
[43:40.320 --> 43:45.600]  delisting us and other libertarian and other conservative groups but notice this story about
[43:45.600 --> 43:52.960]  mcmaster you type in mcmaster and you click google all or the entire web agree with showing to me
[43:52.960 --> 44:00.320]  right for the show we're gonna put that on screen for folks you see that the top link is the story
[44:01.440 --> 44:11.920]  that we broke yesterday report mcmaster labeled trump scary a dope and and several other links
[44:11.920 --> 44:16.080]  are our links at the top now why are they doing that they're selectively letting that through
[44:16.080 --> 44:19.440]  because they think it discredits the entire administration and goes along with our fake
[44:19.440 --> 44:24.480]  narrative that he's got Alzheimer's no we said that because three people we talked to close the
[44:24.480 --> 44:29.920]  president said he never has done this before he's doing it at night now we think something's going
[44:29.920 --> 44:34.800]  on he doesn't drink and it's not fatigue and we shed it so that the president can think about it
[44:34.800 --> 44:40.480]  if he hears about it and get his blood tested but the big news we covered the most important news
[44:40.480 --> 44:46.160]  Keith Schiller his bodyguard for close to three decades his confidant didn't trump didn't even
[44:46.160 --> 44:52.640]  know we now learn that he had resigned because he couldn't even get to trump anymore and trump quote
[44:52.640 --> 44:58.320]  has been devastated by this so the big news we wanted to get out to see how disciplined the
[44:58.320 --> 45:05.040]  control corporate press is didn't get out all the other stuff got out but not the big news that we
[45:05.040 --> 45:12.000]  want to get out regardless of what you think trump's bodyguard is gone he's totally isolated
[45:12.000 --> 45:17.680]  and he is a kept person to a great extent if he's so surrounded that's not just command and control
[45:17.680 --> 45:22.480]  if he's so surrounded so controlled that he can't even have his bodyguard and his
[45:22.480 --> 45:26.240]  daughter can't even get in the scene and they've got to write reports about what they talk to him
[45:26.240 --> 45:31.280]  about and then the very people go on the news like Kelly and say oh don't worry we don't let him get
[45:31.280 --> 45:39.040]  info wars or Breitbart you know we're controlling the info he gets it's so condescending and so
[45:39.040 --> 45:43.920]  we're replacing one deep state with Hillary for another deep state and I don't like it Roger Stone
[45:43.920 --> 45:47.840]  thank you for joining us great to be here Alex let's get into it
[45:50.720 --> 45:57.360]  well first of all uh I have to comment on the Ted Cruz item you know why do people take an
[45:57.360 --> 46:05.840]  instantaneous dislike to Ted Cruz while they're just saving time in this case I have no criticism
[46:05.840 --> 46:12.720]  for Ted Cruz I myself am a libertarian and a libertine I'm not running for public office
[46:12.720 --> 46:18.480]  the reason here it seems to me if there is one is that on the one hand Ted tells us he's a devout
[46:18.480 --> 46:24.480]  evangelical christian and on the other hand he appears to be checking out porn on the internet
[46:24.480 --> 46:29.440]  now there's nothing wrong with watching porn on the internet this is a free country we have a
[46:29.440 --> 46:34.480]  the right to do that if you choose to you also have the right not to do it if you don't choose to
[46:34.480 --> 46:42.000]  but it's the hypocrisy that makes this a story not the alleged actions by uh by Mr. Cruz
[46:43.360 --> 46:47.680]  that said I want to break down exactly what you talked about here Alex because
[46:48.400 --> 46:55.280]  and to a great extent the mainstream media only carried half the story we broke amazing news here
[46:55.280 --> 47:00.320]  yesterday info wars but they don't seem to understand the cause and effect
[47:00.320 --> 47:07.680]  he's Schiller who is one of the finest men I have ever known decorated former New York police
[47:07.680 --> 47:16.080]  detective a longtime bodyguard for Donald Trump the guy who always has the president's back
[47:16.640 --> 47:21.440]  you can see him in almost every picture hovering near the president when he's
[47:21.440 --> 47:28.560]  on the rally tour or in public he's Schiller man who's put his own life on the line to protect
[47:28.560 --> 47:35.440]  Donald Trump it was Schiller who grabbed the guy you may recall who tried to vault onto the stage
[47:35.440 --> 47:44.000]  in Ohio and get at the president during the campaign Schiller has been purged by McMaster why
[47:44.000 --> 47:50.640]  because he has a direct pipeline and access to the president he carries out the president's orders
[47:51.280 --> 47:57.920]  he's Schiller is a man with no agenda other than the agenda of Donald Trump no agenda other than
[47:57.920 --> 48:08.400]  the success of the Trump presidency now separately we at info wars have three solid individual sources
[48:08.400 --> 48:15.600]  who all tell us that in phone conversations with the president that he was at some point
[48:15.600 --> 48:23.040]  slurring his words perhaps if this were one report you would chop that up to fatigue he works
[48:23.040 --> 48:31.360]  very very hard for the American people but when three people repeat it and we know that he doesn't
[48:31.360 --> 48:39.440]  drink at all not even wine we know he doesn't do drugs he is not personally a in favor of
[48:39.440 --> 48:46.160]  marijuana even though he is a supporter of states rights on the question and that he has
[48:46.160 --> 48:52.560]  extraordinarily work ethic in term of the hours this behavior is inconsistent with everything
[48:52.560 --> 48:59.520]  we know about him now when you connect these two facts the possibility that he is being drug
[48:59.520 --> 49:07.040]  or medicated by his handlers is more than entirely possible it's not crazy it's not a conspiracy
[49:07.040 --> 49:14.000]  theory it's not outrageous it's entirely likely based on the evidence what's sad about the mainstream
[49:14.000 --> 49:21.440]  media is they say oh Alex Jones says the president's being drug without telling people the backstory
[49:21.440 --> 49:29.840]  the backstory being general Kelly's insane desire to get complete and total isolation of the president
[49:29.840 --> 49:38.560]  so that no one he talks to no one he sees is outside the control of general Kelly and his handlers
[49:40.640 --> 49:45.040]  well it's eerie it's like something out of a horror movie we're now his best friend basically
[49:45.040 --> 49:50.000]  his confidant of 30 years the guy that he absolutely trusts the guy that you know brings
[49:50.000 --> 49:55.280]  him his fast food you know everything checks everything is now just gone and that Trump didn't
[49:55.280 --> 50:03.680]  know that he'd done this how did they get rid of him well I'm told that that Schiller was refused
[50:03.680 --> 50:11.360]  the opportunity to speak to the president about his dismissal and that and that Kelly told the
[50:11.360 --> 50:18.240]  president that if it was either Schiller or him there was a very important New York Times piece
[50:18.240 --> 50:25.120]  roughly a week ago I'm quoted in the piece but that's not what's important that made the case
[50:25.840 --> 50:32.800]  and Glenn Thrush the reporter I spoke to made this case to me that Trump needs Kelly more than Kelly
[50:32.800 --> 50:42.080]  needs Trump I completely disagree with that Don Trump needs a chief of staff who understands
[50:42.080 --> 50:50.880]  the Trump revolution understands how Trump was elected understands the constituency that he appeals
[50:50.880 --> 50:58.720]  to and then he now has to keep in place as a governing constituency a governing consensus
[51:00.320 --> 51:06.480]  that's what the president needs now he also needs somebody who's organized who understands
[51:06.480 --> 51:11.120]  government and how it works sure sure not going to interrupt here Roger but let's expand on this
[51:11.120 --> 51:18.880]  briefly I mean think of the attitude when you've got Kelly and his adjuncts on TV saying we control
[51:18.880 --> 51:24.880]  his information he goes with the last thing he's given we've got him totally isolated don't worry
[51:24.880 --> 51:30.320]  we've got the nuclear football in control you know one of the generals you know never leaves town
[51:30.320 --> 51:37.360]  with the others we're babysitting him they're just totally like a bunch of old senile men
[51:37.360 --> 51:44.560]  buying into CNN MSNBC and all the rest the hype they don't get the country's broken with them
[51:44.560 --> 51:52.160]  we're tired of it we don't like seeing the president's encircled I don't want access to the president
[51:52.160 --> 51:58.080]  I haven't even sit there and pushed to try to get him back on the show I want cut taxes I want
[51:58.080 --> 52:04.480]  sovereignty I want to not import unvetted hordes of radical Muslims I don't want to sexualize
[52:04.480 --> 52:10.240]  children I you know I want all the basic things Trump wants I want him to have the advisory board
[52:10.240 --> 52:14.880]  investigating vaccine dangers I want the Trump agenda I heard about we've already gotten some
[52:14.880 --> 52:19.200]  of it it's been great but more and more we see them cutting him off slowing them down
[52:19.200 --> 52:25.680]  and showing disdain virtue signaling in the media and if they're so command and control and
[52:25.680 --> 52:29.600]  they're the generals and they're the guys that'll save America you know they're the guys that know
[52:29.600 --> 52:35.440]  what to do and but none of us are even humans compared to them okay then stop shooting your
[52:35.440 --> 52:41.840]  mouths off undermining the president his agenda so you get your butt kicked or your butt kissed in
[52:41.840 --> 52:50.000]  New York and DC and all the rest of it they are socially weak and are bowing down to the pressure
[52:50.000 --> 52:56.400]  and running down the president everywhere they can aka look at the secretary of state Rex Tillerson
[52:56.400 --> 53:02.800]  these people are running from the president even as we get the best median income numbers in US
[53:02.800 --> 53:08.480]  history in today even as we see the economy turning on despite everything they're doing
[53:08.480 --> 53:14.400]  trying to stop it it's disgusting they're a bunch of social climbing people just like Hollywood
[53:14.400 --> 53:21.600]  scum they're all acting the same and I'm sick of it America elected Trump flyover country elected
[53:21.600 --> 53:26.800]  Trump info wars elected Trump we don't want to be in your filthy DC we don't want to be in your
[53:26.800 --> 53:32.480]  filthy LA we don't want to be in your filthy little red carpets and private jets and all you ugly
[53:32.480 --> 53:38.720]  dead peacocks we're America we're the red blood we work the jobs we pay the taxes and we're the
[53:38.720 --> 53:45.360]  country not Hollywood not the globalist not the communist Chinese not special interests and not some
[53:45.360 --> 53:53.520]  clique of generals either well I think you're exactly right this whole attitude is born of
[53:53.520 --> 54:01.440]  arrogance and entitlement if you will is born out of the fact that they have run the country for
[54:01.440 --> 54:07.920]  the last 30 years the transition of power from the bushes to the Clintons is seamless because
[54:07.920 --> 54:15.680]  they are the same people their appointees are the same people their globalist anti-american
[54:15.680 --> 54:20.720]  mindset and that's why we have we have the Clinton holdovers the Obama holdovers and all of them
[54:20.720 --> 54:25.840]  all lockstep blocking Trump right now and that's why you've got these generals paying an all lip
[54:25.840 --> 54:29.680]  service and going along with putting in more Soros people because they've been taking orders from
[54:29.680 --> 54:35.280]  these folks for 30 years it's their bosses their bosses are George Soros and Hillary Clinton and
[54:35.280 --> 54:41.920]  they're still taking orders why else would the Trump Justice Department be fighting the release
[54:41.920 --> 54:49.680]  of Hillary's emails why else would the Trump State Department be fighting the Hungarian
[54:49.680 --> 54:55.680]  government to stop them from trying to throw George Soros out of the country we have an
[54:55.680 --> 55:03.120]  Obama government with a few Trump appointees at the top that's what can currently exists in Washington
[55:03.120 --> 55:10.640]  this is the greatest single danger to the president and to the Trump agenda and the the arrogance of
[55:10.640 --> 55:18.080]  those around the president that we know better again i've referred to the story we broke yesterday
[55:18.080 --> 55:26.640]  of uh general McMaster uh and Mike Cernovich reported this some months ago he was teetering
[55:26.640 --> 55:34.960]  teetering on holding on the stories about his out of control drinking were ubiquitous in Washington
[55:34.960 --> 55:41.760]  and well known in the White House his career was saved when the previous was thrown out
[55:41.760 --> 55:49.840]  and his new protector general Kelly was ensconced this this strengthened McMaster's hand how does
[55:49.840 --> 55:59.680]  Mr. McMaster general McMaster justify the hiring of Fiona Hill uh at the nsc to handle Russia Fiona
[55:59.680 --> 56:06.960]  Hill worked for George Soros Fiona Hill hates Donald Trump hates the Trump doctrine hates
[56:06.960 --> 56:13.040]  everything we are trying to do why is this woman have a White House past and now we go back we go
[56:13.040 --> 56:17.360]  back a month ago they said within two months Trump will be neutralized i mean is this the
[56:17.360 --> 56:23.120]  neutralization where just everyone's gone the family can't see him no one can see him and then
[56:23.120 --> 56:28.320]  that and then how did they get Trump maneuvered into this position where his best friend is gone
[56:28.320 --> 56:33.440]  that sounds very concerning and i mean how else could they get this this stubborn person to do
[56:33.440 --> 56:41.200]  that unless they are drugging him look at it this way Alex the president is the king he's a good king
[56:41.200 --> 56:47.040]  but right now he's a captive of the bad guys they're keeping him isolated in the tower because
[56:47.040 --> 56:53.200]  they know he has good works in mind and they want to undo what he wants for the people and they're
[56:53.200 --> 56:56.800]  telling him let's get into the blackmail we didn't get into that yesterday let's get into the the
[56:56.800 --> 57:05.600]  jagger-hoover stuff yeah look i think that that there are uh those who would bear false witness
[57:05.600 --> 57:12.880]  against the president claim that he had uh inappropriate relationships or other uh other
[57:12.880 --> 57:20.480]  matters of blackmail i happen to know that there's nothing to these stories but they're going to do
[57:20.480 --> 57:28.720]  anything necessary to try to control the president when you are president of the united states you
[57:28.720 --> 57:35.920]  live in a fishbowl you're not going to have a girlfriend or perhaps in the case of previous
[57:35.920 --> 57:41.920]  presidents a boyfriend because there's no way to conceal it the world would know there's no
[57:41.920 --> 57:48.160]  there's no way to be discreet and be president united states but i don't trust the deep staters to
[57:48.160 --> 57:56.000]  make crap up about our president because they've done it before because they lie because lying
[57:56.000 --> 58:01.440]  is what they do that's what the sure well they put they put they put the pee pee the pee pee
[58:01.440 --> 58:05.760]  dossi out i mean they put out all this fake stuff they all the fake lawsuits about him kidnapping
[58:05.760 --> 58:09.360]  little girls it turned out it was fake names uh because they're trying to cover up the jerry
[58:09.360 --> 58:14.800]  epstein stuff that the clinton's have on them that's exactly right and by the way most of those
[58:14.800 --> 58:20.160]  people have come forward and recanted one case there's evidence that clinton's were paying them
[58:20.160 --> 58:29.040]  to say these false things down from has never dealt with underage girls it's a lie it's a fraud
[58:29.040 --> 58:34.000]  but i think they'll use anything in there in there absolutely well then let's talk about
[58:34.000 --> 58:37.600]  the next shoe to drop and then we've got other guests coming up to stay with us five more minutes

[01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:20.400]  scandal russian collusion that's nonsense so it was we called the russian collusion delusion but

[01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:13.920]  but you rode upon a steamer to the violence of the sun broadcasting live from the un stronghold
[01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:22.240]  austin texas you're listening to the alex jones show at the colors of the sea that's right austin
[01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:28.080]  is a model un city and they say that they take their orders from the un they couldn't pass the
[01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:34.160]  carbon tax seven years ago member schwarzzenegger became the un envoy and he said he was he was
[01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:39.600]  leaving the governorship of california he said i will now go to the cities and we will bypass the
[01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:44.880]  states in the congress and we will implement the united nations program on climate carbon tax
[01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:50.400]  and then we have the strong cities initiative with loretta lynch just eight months ago when she
[01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:57.440]  was leaving office there as the attorney general she said we're going to have the un advise us
[01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:03.920]  on our police departments and then we have george soros funding all of this in the wiki
[01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:11.680]  league saying overthrow israel so finally israel's come out and listed george soros uh as basically
[01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:16.400]  a criminal organization like hungary and others have done and then magically you see them trying
[01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:22.480]  to indict the prime minister there because his wife reportedly had government chefs cook dinner a
[01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:26.880]  couple times at government meetings at their house well i didn't know prime ministers couldn't have
[01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:31.520]  dinner cooked for him that's quite a crime ladies and gentlemen but again regardless we think about
[01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:37.760]  net yahoo israel any of this there's a war on israel there's a war on christianity there's a
[01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:44.400]  war on free speech there's a war on basic western values of any type and there's a massive radical
[01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:50.400]  islamic muslim brotherhood funding with mcmaster up there and the rest of it and brennan converting
[01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:56.160]  to lobbyism and the former fbi director taking radical islam out of the terror database and
[01:09:56.160 --> 01:10:02.720]  then putting christians number one on there and then you get diane feinstein coming out and other
[01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:10.080]  senators dick durbin and mazzi harano saying we don't know if you can be a catholic with your
[01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:15.760]  conservative dogma and be on the bench wow imagine if they said that
[01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:23.280]  about any other religious group organization so it is it's serious folks and the leftist
[01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:28.640]  are making their move speaking of that let's play a clip here before we get to this article paypal
[01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:35.120]  bans conservative sites after soros funded group attack them well it's beyond that as matt drudge
[01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:39.680]  warned here in the studio here and a half ago they want to put everybody in internet ghettos first
[01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:44.640]  first shut us down economically and shut our speech down then they'll physically shut us down
[01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:49.600]  this is this is how you always roll out tyranny we're banned off google ads we're banned off ad
[01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:54.080]  roll we're getting banned everywhere my lawyers are saying we've got to sue we'll we'll probably win
[01:10:54.080 --> 01:11:02.480]  the cases there's a thing why don't they care now they're doing bold stuff they're doing bold things
[01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:10.160]  and it's crazy here's here's diane feinstein shingling out a christian judge with a great record
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:17.120]  again this is the leftist vitriol of overthrow anything that's not atheist i guess but then
[01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:24.000]  they're allied with islam it throw gays off buildings here it is when you read your speeches
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:37.920]  um the conclusion one draws is that the dogma lives loudly within you and that's of concern
[01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:46.560]  when you come to big issues that large numbers of people have fought for for years in this country
[01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:51.600]  so you got the leftist pope now pushing world government saying he's disgusted by europe's
[01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:56.160]  christian roots that's a quote saying open up the borders have the whole islamic invasion
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:12:01.600]  that they now admit the vice president of the e u says is to replace europe with muslims and if you
[01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:06.400]  don't like that you're racist racist i don't want to live in saudi arabia or north africa so
[01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:11.440]  you know libya where they cut women's genitals off and women are kept in slave pits and sold
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:16.160]  on auction blocks but again the left and linda sorcerer they can all fundraise they can get
[01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:19.920]  money for the hurricane relief that's okay we're about to go to our guests but i want to give you
[01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:25.200]  just today's background because what's happening today finish police chief terrorists should be
[01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:32.000]  allowed in schools to expand tolerance this is actually from the local newspaper this is in
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:37.920]  mainstream news he did a tv interview of a major city after a 22 year old moroccan
[01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:45.440]  stabbed 10 people killing two they said it's time to start restricting these people and he said on
[01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:50.800]  the contrary even a terrorist can benefit from good learning i might widen views to expand
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:58.320]  tolerance responded the police chief tapening and it goes on to say a finished citizen express relief
[01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:03.120]  on twitter uh they didn't try to attack a school giving reports that he had multiple different
[01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:08.240]  attack plans on the contrary people need to be motivated to stay in school whether it's a child
[01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:13.600]  or an adult responded the superintendent a police chief he has been asked by another individual as
[01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:18.400]  a police officer you support terrorists being in our school children schools he said yes i support
[01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:25.760]  terrorist you cannot make up the stock home syndrome of this strangely enough uh it's it's
[01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:31.920]  just i don't know what you call it so so let's go to our guest who literally is being put into an
[01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:38.240]  internet ghetto for jihad watch that just shows the radical islamists saying they're gonna kill
[01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:44.880]  everybody saying teaching kids to suicide bomb teaching them to blow up u.s. military and then
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:51.760]  it's like oh i forgot to stock home in other areas they're bringing in former ices people and giving
[01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:58.080]  them preferential welfare and housing so again this is an alliance with the left something i heard
[01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:03.040]  david horowitz and people you know say 15 years ago and i didn't believe because it sounded crazy
[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:10.000]  it's really here it's here so joining us is robert spencer of jihadwatch.org that had its
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:16.400]  PayPal blocked because george soros a literal nazi collaborator who openly wants the overthrow of
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:22.400]  israel uh i mean you talk about international criminal he gets to have his bank accounts but
[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:27.680]  jihad watch they can't be on paypal and folks if they can't be there we're next and it's already
[01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:33.120]  happening being de-platformed this is such a dangerous day so i've set this up with just some
[01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:37.680]  of the background uh robert spencer this is so serious if we don't hang together we're gonna
[01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:42.800]  hang separate oh there's no doubt about it alex absolutely and of course it's not just PayPal
[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:50.400]  as you well know google search for years because they were working on the basis of subject matter
[01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:55.840]  and the number of readers if you search for jihad you would get jihad watch first my website
[01:14:55.840 --> 01:15:00.960]  because it's a news and commentary site about jihad activity but recently they have changed the way
[01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:07.040]  they do the google searches so that nothing unfavorable nothing unfavorable about islam
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:13.920]  comes up if you search for jihad or sharia or islam you only get favorable results from google now
[01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:19.040]  and they're doing that to all of our stuff as well and admitting they're doing it we even
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:24.640]  got internal documents so this is real racketeering they operate as a utility in their own words
[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:30.720]  and then they have a monopoly and they're openly blocking us this is so dangerous yeah absolutely
[01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:35.600]  they're using charlotte's bill is their livestock fire moment to try to shut down all dissent and
[01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:40.960]  of course as you well know it's not just PayPal it's not just google in february the readership to
[01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:46.800]  jihad watch referrals from facebook and twitter drops 90 percent they put in some kind of blocks
[01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:52.240]  so that the referrals just don't go through so many people write me and say i click on your links
[01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:57.440]  and they just don't work it's what facebook and you know something else alex there's a reason for
[01:15:57.440 --> 01:16:02.720]  this the facebook vice president joe kaplan recently traveled to pakistan and he promised
[01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:06.960]  the pakistani government that they would remove all material critical of his long which means
[01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:12.160]  counter terror analysis that discusses the motives and goals of terrorists you know i forgot that
[01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:16.240]  that's what's so frustrating there's so much evidence in fact facebook twitter and others
[01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:21.520]  have been helping in pakistan and iran people that mildly criticize the government they're
[01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:27.440]  ratting them out giving their location and some are being executed yes and that includes people
[01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:32.640]  who commit blasphemy according to Islam which in many cases in pakistan it's just christians and
[01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:36.800]  that some muslim comes up to them and says do you think mohammad is a prophet and they say no
[01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:41.680]  and they're accused of blasphemy and this is what facebook is aiding and abetting they explicitly
[01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:46.720]  promised caldry nisar ali khan the interior minister of pakistan that they would remove all
[01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:53.360]  anti islamic material from facebook well i'm going to be joining a class action suit against cnn but
[01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:58.000]  i've been talking to top law firms will win all these cases the problem is it'll take years to
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:03.680]  litigate but with you it's so clear you're putting a database by the southern prairie law center
[01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:09.280]  funded by soros that's been caught with 60 plus million probably illegal money in offshore accounts
[01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:14.720]  they are literally literally involved in massive civil rights violations against you trying to
[01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:20.240]  block a news organization as well i mean i don't think you have any course but to sue paypal to
[01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:26.400]  sue google and we've got to start litigating yeah absolutely the problem is there's a communications
[01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:33.920]  decency acts that obama put in section 230 gives facebook twitter google all the social media giants
[01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:39.040]  gives them immunity from that kind of challenge so but they're selectively enforcing it so i think
[01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:44.160]  it still opens it up to a civil rights issue i sure hope so absolutely but we have to try i think we
[01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:49.840]  have to challenge it every which way we can sue the government to get that removed sue paypal facebook
[01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:56.640]  google all the rest of them and let's expand on that you see trump being isolated and we see all
[01:17:56.640 --> 01:18:04.400]  this unfolding i mean there's just so many ways they're censoring is so many ways the censorship
[01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:11.600]  is not coming it's here what do we do we have to i think somehow make it clear to trump and
[01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:16.640]  even to the corrupt republican establishment that the war on free speech is something they're
[01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:22.400]  gonna have to pay attention to that if they don't then there's good then citizens are going to have
[01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:28.400]  to act themselves i'm not talking about some kind of vigilante action i just mean that we cannot
[01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:34.720]  give our votes anymore to politicians who are not on this issue google right now and facebook and
[01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:38.880]  the rest of them they hold more power than any government and they are censoring more than the
[01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:44.720]  soviet union ever did and this if this isn't stopped then trump is going to lose any fragments of
[01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:50.160]  his base he has left and everyone except those who pushed the hard left agenda are going to be
[01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:56.480]  completely choked off we have to all act now and make this and act in every possible way we can
[01:18:56.480 --> 01:19:01.440]  to turn this around or you know where it's going to end up as you say first they take away the
[01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:07.600]  platforms they take away our voice and then they're going to come for us and they say they're going
[01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:13.360]  to come for us they say they're beating conservatives christians people up everywhere they're attacking
[01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:18.640]  it's super invoke now to hate jews and i'm not just jumping on that bandwagon it's true and it's
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:25.120]  just it's it's crazy that our own governments and systems are allied with the most orthodox forms
[01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:33.200]  of aggressive cancerous islam yes absolutely and it seems as if what you have is two forces that
[01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:39.120]  hate america that hate judaeo christian civilization that hate western values and so they see each
[01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:44.640]  other as kindred and also both have an authoritarian heart the left is authoritarian at heart every
[01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:50.480]  time the hard left has come to power it's been a rain of terror and the violent suppression of all
[01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:55.760]  dissent and islamic law is just the same way robert stand up let's talk about what we do when we

[01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:27.520]  broadcasts because here's the thing info wars is one of the only groups that has the
[01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:34.720]  mass of listeners to punch through this if our listeners take action drudge also and he's been
[01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:38.240]  attacked and criticized and they've tried to say that the federal elections commission
[01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:42.720]  should investigate him criminally and me and we're paid for by the russians and all this other
[01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:48.240]  crud you heard our guests it's true we have more censorship by google facebook and twitter now than
[01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:55.520]  the soviet union they admit they're doing it okay so the listeners have to know we're in a war
[01:24:55.520 --> 01:24:59.200]  war and if they're able to curtail this they're going to shut everybody down they're going for
[01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:04.880]  broke this is real authoritarianism in their own words hillary's admitted this she meant to be in
[01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:09.760]  power and doing this now so they're going ahead with the plan they had in place that obama and
[01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:14.800]  hillary put in place so listen you've got to spread the links to jihad watch you've got to
[01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:19.680]  support them you've got to support info wars dot com and i'm not griping at you this is a great

[01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:31.680]  the censored sites because historically there's a strizand effect they're miscalculating and thinking
[01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:36.240]  they can just quietly censor us and we'll go away they're trying to break your will we have to
[01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:42.960]  realize this is serious and have a maximum effort to stand up against this what else do you think
[01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:49.520]  robert spencer of jihad watch dot org we should do oh well you know we need to raise awareness
[01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:55.040]  about this whole idea about hate speech that i hear so many times when i speak on college campuses
[01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:59.760]  if i'm not just screamed at and shouted down altogether then i hear i see it again and again
[01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:05.920]  now alex students saying hate speech is not free speech and this increasingly common idea on the
[01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:10.240]  left that there is this thing called hate speech which they identify with really anything that
[01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:15.280]  descends from their program and they think that it does not deserve first amendment protection
[01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:21.680]  and so you know that this is a prelude to the downright outright outlawing of certain kinds
[01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:28.160]  of speech including honest discussion of the motivating ideology of jihad terror as you're
[01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:34.800]  showing on the screen that the man in germany was was was de-platformed for criticizing islam
[01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:41.440]  got a six month sentence he was a journalist exposing that mainline islam was allied with hitler
[01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:47.200]  and is still allied with that and then he he was going to go to jail for as being a journalist
[01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:53.680]  yeah and yet it's it's demonstrable fact hajameen al-hussaini the mufti of jerusalem
[01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:59.680]  the leading authority in the islamic world spent 1941 to 45 in berlin made broadcasts
[01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:06.560]  for the nazis in in arabic encouraging Muslims quoting the caron about the the how evil the jews
[01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:12.160]  were encouraging them to support hitler this is just a matter of fact but fact and truth
[01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:17.360]  that's what's being outlawed and you know hillary clinton did start this four or five years ago
[01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:23.280]  remember when she was secretary of state she signed on to resolution 1618 at the united nations
[01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:28.080]  which called on member states to criminalize incitement to religious hatred now nobody cares
[01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:32.960]  when people criticize islam i mean criticize christianity you know the crucifix in the jar of
[01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:37.120]  urine that's art that's not the religious hatred they're talking about they were talking about
[01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:43.360]  criticism of islam and less well known is that hillary clinton went to istanbul in december
[01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:48.880]  2012 and spoke in a meeting of the organization of islamic cooperation and she said well yes
[01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:54.400]  we have this first amendment we can't just outlaw various kinds of speech outright but we can use
[01:27:54.400 --> 01:27:59.680]  old-fashioned techniques of peer pressure and shaming to get people not to say what we don't
[01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:06.720]  want that's kassamstein that's the nudging and and then you see this this venomous hatred of
[01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:15.120]  judaism christianity anything western a total a total merger of the left with with virulent
[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:20.480]  radical islam yeah and the peer pressure and shaming works just the way that they planned it
[01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:26.880]  the splcs hate hate group list it's trying to shame us into not saying these things that are
[01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:32.000]  critical of islam by lumping us in together with real hate groups you know the clan and the neo
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:38.880]  nazis and all that that and and people it works remember at the in san bernadino when 15 people
[01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:44.640]  were killed by islamic terrorists at a christmas party in 2015 they interviewed the neighbors and
[01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:48.960]  the neighbors said yeah we saw a lot of suspicious things going on in that house but we didn't call
[01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:53.840]  the police we didn't want to seem racist they were susceptible to that shaming that hillary clinton
[01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:58.960]  was talking and it's a new religion to submit to it and to say we're going to be islamic european
[01:28:58.960 --> 01:29:04.320]  leaders now go yeah we are going to be islamic it's so insane like this police chief saying
[01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:10.800]  we need terrorists in our schools he actually said that incredible yeah but i see incredible stories
[01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:17.600]  like this every day at geod watch it from out of sweden out of out of germany it's racist it's bigoted
[01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:24.160]  it's islamophobic if you raise the slightest dissenting word about this crime wave this rape
[01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:28.080]  wave everything that's come from these muslim migrants that's right well please come back
[01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:32.160]  soon to break it all down very impressed with the work of geod watch over the decade plus seven
[01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:36.880]  reading you just show what they're saying that's why they hate you so much just like we do we've
[01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:41.680]  got to stand together and develop a plan to fight back we will win sir god bless you we'll be back
[01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:51.440]  stay with us we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:29:56.400 --> 01:30:01.440]  james madison the father of the bill of rights wrote we're in excess of power prevails property
[01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:07.600]  of no sort is duly respected no man is safe in his opinions in his person in his faculties or in
[01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:12.560]  his possessions is there any question that we have an excess of power in washington the only
[01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:17.840]  question is how do we contain it and how do we remove that power from washington to our local
[01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:23.760]  communities to the individual that is the ultimate concern the concentration of power the excess of
[01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:29.200]  power was always the chief concern of the founders of this country that was why the antifederalists
[01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:33.600]  opposed the constitution they believe they put safeguards in the constitution to abuse that
[01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:39.280]  concentration of power but as james madison also pointed out knowledge will forever govern ignorance
[01:30:39.280 --> 01:30:44.160]  of people who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power that knowledge
[01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:49.040]  gives arm yourself with the information of what your rulers are doing of what the real constraints
[01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:55.120]  upon them are only then will you have the courage to nullify their actions friend for wars dot com

[01:32:01.120 --> 01:32:06.240]  and in the last four or five years doing more and more research i came across the fact that the
[01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:12.240]  elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors in many cases had much
[01:32:12.240 --> 01:32:18.560]  better nutrition than we do today and our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that
[01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:24.160]  they were hunting killing and then processing and so i set out to develop caveman but to not just
[01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:32.000]  have concentrated bone broth from chicken but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing
[01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:37.280]  and supercharging the body at the same time info wars isn't just fighting the globalist
[01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:43.440]  we're getting results and we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault and winning

[01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:35.680]  hillary and obama and others openly promoting it and funding them and paypal says you're banned
[01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:42.000]  because the southern poverty law center an offshore cartel hundreds of millions offshore not just

[01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:17.680]  investigated along with matt drudge and of course the republican congress shot it down
[01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:22.160]  claiming we must be funded by russia and that they wanted to know our finances
[01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:31.760]  know our finances zero money from russia 100 percent from the listeners of this broadcast

[01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:44.080]  buying products directly from info wars store.com and the answer is lawsuits they don't have total
[01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:47.360]  immunity that's a trick they're saying when they violate civil rights that trumps it
[01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:53.280]  they're engaged in so many other activities and i wanted to talk to chuck johnson the site's also
[01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:59.040]  been banned from trump seeing it because melania trump the wife i mean you can't just let the

[01:42:31.680 --> 01:42:34.720]  well you want to get into the censorship first or the senator menendez trial
[01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:39.600]  well let's get into the censorship first because it's so it's so worth getting fired up over
[01:42:40.160 --> 01:42:45.440]  i mean we're in a we're in a real fight now where private corporations are working with the
[01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:51.680]  governments and with outside activist groups like the splc to target people and destroy their livelihoods
[01:42:51.680 --> 01:42:56.400]  it's uh it's do or die for a lot of people and i've got to tell you a lot of folks need to start
[01:42:56.400 --> 01:43:01.840]  looking into bitcoin i know you know you might be a skeptic on this alex but you know bitcoin
[01:43:01.840 --> 01:43:07.200]  has changed got news's finances for the better certainly helped julina saange avoid no no i'm
[01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:12.880]  not against it i just don't get anything speculative because i know they claim me breathing is illegal
[01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:19.920]  so you know i hear you yeah you've got to be careful um you got to be careful with it obviously
[01:43:19.920 --> 01:43:24.640]  it's you know it's an unproven technology but it's done it's done well over the last six years or so
[01:43:24.640 --> 01:43:29.600]  but any event the reason i um you know i think we're gonna have to we're gonna have to crowd fund
[01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:33.760]  at some point to do lawsuits against these companies we're gonna have to have whistleblowers on the
[01:43:33.760 --> 01:43:37.520]  inside of them talking about the unethical behavior going on inside that's already starting
[01:43:38.640 --> 01:43:42.880]  that's already starting you know there are people who are even you know good good leftists in other
[01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:48.000]  sorts waking up in these companies they know they know that you know first they shut down the nazis
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:51.680]  but then of course they're coming for they're coming you know bright part is having its ads
[01:43:51.680 --> 01:43:57.600]  targeted there have been all these sites now where people's livelihoods are getting crushed um
[01:43:57.600 --> 01:44:02.960]  um you know gateway pundit has that just happened too and we're reaching a point now where they're
[01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:08.800]  trying to use advertiser boycotts they're trying to ban us from technologies um and this is all
[01:44:08.800 --> 01:44:13.040]  you know and a lot of these companies are created in california it's illegal to discriminate against
[01:44:13.040 --> 01:44:17.840]  people on their politics in california that's right let's be clear they're trying to not let us
[01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:23.520]  have access to new software new platforms new systems it's a trillion times worse than not letting
[01:44:23.520 --> 01:44:28.560]  you know people bake a gay couple of cake and i'm not for that either but but this is such discrimination
[01:44:29.840 --> 01:44:34.480]  yeah and it's it's pretty wild at some point we're gonna have to use the ftc i mean i i talk to some
[01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:39.680]  people at the department of justice in the antitrust division going after google like we're gonna
[01:44:39.680 --> 01:44:44.000]  have to start using unfortunately we're gonna have to start using our allies in the government to
[01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:49.200]  fight them um and it's very uh it's very disturbing what's been going on here they're also helping
[01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:54.560]  people in pakistan and iran get arrested and executed because twitter and facebook tells on them
[01:44:54.560 --> 01:44:59.360]  so they're already enforcing islamic law that shows they're ready to be total tyrants here
[01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:04.560]  facebook and twitter are literally literally there is on screen working to kill people
[01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:10.880]  for their free speech they will kill you facebook and twitter will sit there and help you be murdered
[01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:16.080]  by authoritarian regimes they are ready and willing they've hired the old stasi in germany to help run
[01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:22.320]  facebook you cannot make this up no it's very scary stuff and it's going to be accelerating
[01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:26.480]  you know because we have a whole generation now of young people who don't really believe in the
[01:45:26.480 --> 01:45:30.880]  values of free speech and the culture of free speech and we have all these people who are very
[01:45:30.880 --> 01:45:35.760]  legalistic you know they they seem to believe that private corporations can't fire and hire who they
[01:45:35.760 --> 01:45:39.920]  want but somehow the private corporation has a right to decide that they won't do business with
[01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:44.160]  whoever they want for whatever reason they want and of course we have public accommodation laws
[01:45:44.160 --> 01:45:48.640]  for a reason um and i think it's much scarier though because so many of these tech companies
[01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:52.720]  are monopolies i mean what would happen if they just turned off the skype right now you know what
[01:45:52.720 --> 01:45:57.920]  would happen if they just banned you from the internet and you know i was i was in vain against
[01:45:57.920 --> 01:46:02.320]  this and fighting against this two years ago when i was the first journalist banned on twitter
[01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:08.640]  and i got banned for insulting jack dorsey's uh friend and people said it's his boyfriend
[01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:13.760]  uh during the kesson who's the founder of black lives matter and i was banned you know people said
[01:46:13.760 --> 01:46:18.480]  oh you know you're just extreme you know don't worry you know you're an extremist and all this
[01:46:18.480 --> 01:46:22.800]  sort of thing it won't happen to me that's what my little uninopolis told said to me and then of
[01:46:22.800 --> 01:46:28.000]  course he was banned and so this is how it works now like there's a second class citizenship
[01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:33.280]  and until we fight back until we start targeting these companies with protests with letter writing
[01:46:33.280 --> 01:46:39.120]  campaigns emails you know with trolling with showing up and really disrupting their shareholder
[01:46:39.120 --> 01:46:45.440]  meetings these things will continue um and they need to be stopped well people like
[01:46:46.080 --> 01:46:51.440]  heiko maas the german justice minister arresting journalists that even report that islam worked
[01:46:51.440 --> 01:46:56.800]  with hitler this guy needs to be in jail he's the tyrant he's the thug he's the problem
[01:46:56.800 --> 01:47:02.800]  well you know there's this uh this this attitude that they all have now where that the social
[01:47:02.800 --> 01:47:08.000]  justice warriors and technologists have which is that if they ban something it will just go away
[01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:12.560]  but in my view it actually becomes much stronger becomes much more you know vitriolic it goes much
[01:47:12.560 --> 01:47:19.120]  deeper underground historically it always does don't they understand no one of the ways to deal
[01:47:19.120 --> 01:47:22.720]  with this stuff is to bring it out in the open and discuss it but of course that would that would
[01:47:22.720 --> 01:47:26.400]  take away the thing that they're addicted to which is their power and that's the thing that you know
[01:47:26.400 --> 01:47:30.080]  we're we're dealing with a bunch of zombies who are addicted to power and who will do anything
[01:47:30.080 --> 01:47:35.440]  to preserve it you know even if it means jailing their fellow countrymen over over facebook posts
[01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:43.040]  or over i mean i myself was banned for facebook for replying uh to somebody calling me a homophobic
[01:47:43.040 --> 01:47:48.480]  slur and i just quoted him and i got banned so i mean it gives you a sense of where we are now
[01:47:48.480 --> 01:47:53.440]  where people people can use the report function on all these posts to basically tattle on their
[01:47:53.440 --> 01:47:57.600]  tattle on people i wonder what would happen if on the report function you could actually like
[01:47:57.600 --> 01:48:01.920]  adjudicated you could actually have a court system you could actually defend yourself of course it's
[01:48:01.920 --> 01:48:07.200]  also turned out that they have super super bot people that that are the equivalent of a hundred
[01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:13.360]  or a thousand votes so that's even rigged too it's their own employees going around with the controls
[01:48:13.360 --> 01:48:18.480]  and then all they're doing is acting like the community reported it so it's okay yeah i mean
[01:48:18.480 --> 01:48:22.080]  look there's a lot of stuff that i know that's going to come out about facebook in the very near
[01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:27.840]  future whistleblowers in there much like we saw with the google james demore guy who by the way
[01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:30.800]  is somebody you should have on your show i think i want him on i've been if you know how to get
[01:48:30.800 --> 01:48:35.200]  him on i want james demore on bed yeah we'll do it we'll do it i'll put you in touch with him um
[01:48:35.200 --> 01:48:39.200]  but let me just add this i think what you're saying lawsuits are key as well civil rights
[01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:43.120]  racketeering they can't have immunity from that i don't care what obama said we're gonna get them
[01:48:43.120 --> 01:48:49.520]  but expanding on that this is incredible the answer is whistleblowers people in these systems
[01:48:49.520 --> 01:48:56.080]  need to leak all this now i mean liberals they're merging with radical islam that literally enslaves
[01:48:56.080 --> 01:49:01.680]  women murders gays and i'm not saying that to patronize but you ought to be ashamed of yourselves
[01:49:01.680 --> 01:49:07.040]  is so-called liberals who claim you really care about people's rights no you don't you use it as a
[01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:12.640]  way to have power over over the rest of society and you're allied with a murdering group of crazy
[01:49:12.640 --> 01:49:19.520]  people and you're disgusting if you don't stand up and speak out so-called liberals you are part of it
[01:49:19.520 --> 01:49:24.720]  i agree 100% and it's interesting to watch the psychology of these people because you know they
[01:49:24.720 --> 01:49:29.520]  really they're really masochistic and they hate they hate their own people in a very serious way
[01:49:29.520 --> 01:49:34.640]  they hate their countries i mean this idea that we need to start destroying statutes we need to
[01:49:34.640 --> 01:49:40.400]  start tearing down our culture and destroying our civilization you know the these are not people
[01:49:40.400 --> 01:49:45.920]  who build things up right they don't they use their power to destroy other ideas and destroy
[01:49:45.920 --> 01:49:52.640]  books to ban books from amazon or to uh or to restrict people from soundcloud or to i mean
[01:49:52.640 --> 01:49:57.120]  this is what these people do and it's very very frightening we need to figure out a way to fight
[01:49:57.120 --> 01:50:02.400]  it that is legal but also consistent with our values and not just surrender to it as so many
[01:50:02.400 --> 01:50:07.120]  people want to do and the attitude that a lot of folks have in the conservative movement is oh don't
[01:50:07.120 --> 01:50:13.600]  worry they'll eat me last right but you know the demand for the demand for internet nazis vastly
[01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:18.160]  exceeds their supply on the left they will make everyone into a nazi before they're finished
[01:50:18.160 --> 01:50:23.440]  just like they make the sclc makes ben karson into a white supremacist right i mean this is how absurd
[01:50:23.440 --> 01:50:30.400]  these things have become wow i'm gonna come back and let's get into this trial of the senator i mean
[01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:35.200]  it's just constantly these people continue to get busted doing these horrible things you've been there
[01:50:35.200 --> 01:50:40.720]  covering and another u.s senator falls from grace will get into why they're having the trial what's
[01:50:40.720 --> 01:50:46.320]  coming out in the trial with chuck johnson and more straight ahead and then we've got professor

[01:54:25.440 --> 01:54:31.840]  amendment is being shredded they are saying they want to adopt eu style rules to arrest people
[01:54:31.840 --> 01:54:37.920]  that mildly criticize islam they are funding antifa to go around and beat up prayer vigils and
[01:54:37.920 --> 01:54:45.840]  then saying that they're saints they are blocking mainline christian groups from commerce on amazon
[01:54:45.840 --> 01:54:52.000]  with an illegal database from a democratic party funded group the southern prairie law center
[01:54:53.360 --> 01:54:58.400]  the adl has lost a bunch of lawsuits for stuff like this previously they think because of the
[01:54:58.400 --> 01:55:04.240]  law obama signed that we mentioned earlier with jihad watch that they've got some type of immunity
[01:55:04.880 --> 01:55:11.040]  but it's not covered by all the other laws it's very specific it's a fraud and they can't sit there
[01:55:11.040 --> 01:55:15.760]  then and say everybody else can't discriminate if they're allowed to discriminate chuck i want to get
[01:55:15.760 --> 01:55:20.720]  back to the menendez trial here but with the senator but uh they're wide open and as you said
[01:55:20.720 --> 01:55:26.640]  whistleblowing is the key but we've got to get really aggressive we do and you know i've offered
[01:55:26.640 --> 01:55:32.320]  people you know bounties for if they if they have insider information at facebook and google offer
[01:55:32.320 --> 01:55:37.280]  them rewards uh for coming forward and being whistleblowers ten thousand dollars if they have
[01:55:37.280 --> 01:55:42.400]  you know material about how google manipulates its politic its searches politically i'm looking for
[01:55:42.400 --> 01:55:46.400]  insiders i'm looking for people who want to be you know witnesses and congressional probes i'm
[01:55:46.400 --> 01:55:51.680]  looking for people who want to be witnesses at the ftc we need to start you know going very
[01:55:51.680 --> 01:55:56.480]  serious against these companies because you know they're they're the face the facebook's amazon's
[01:55:56.480 --> 01:56:01.600]  and google's of the world these are all companies that are much larger than mob bell was before
[01:56:02.240 --> 01:56:06.720]  anti-trust regulation came down against them and so i think you know let's be clear they're
[01:56:06.720 --> 01:56:11.520]  specifically saying christians conservatives libertarians and even targeting mainline groups
[01:56:11.520 --> 01:56:17.360]  now to set the precedent that they can ban anybody they want yeah and it's quite sick to watch how
[01:56:17.360 --> 01:56:21.200]  they're approaching it you know they're freaking out right now you know google is working with a
[01:56:21.200 --> 01:56:26.480]  website called back page dot com to try to stop back page from being shut down and it's essentially
[01:56:26.480 --> 01:56:32.720]  an escort service now why would google care about an escort service well their fear is that when
[01:56:32.720 --> 01:56:37.920]  that when people start regulating dangerous things on the internet like actual you know actual
[01:56:37.920 --> 01:56:44.240]  human trafficking this is something that they are very afraid of and so this is um this is
[01:56:44.240 --> 01:56:49.280]  becoming a very big problem and it's something where we need to start pushing back exactly they
[01:56:49.280 --> 01:56:55.040]  fight to keep really dangerous stuff drug dealing sites you name it up but then at the same time
[01:56:55.040 --> 01:56:59.360]  while they fight to keep you know porn hub open anything else they want they don't want preachers
[01:56:59.360 --> 01:57:04.960]  to be able to sell their books on amazon that's right that's exactly right and it's scary man it
[01:57:04.960 --> 01:57:09.920]  needs to be uh it needs to be called out um i would say you know you know one of the things
[01:57:09.920 --> 01:57:14.000]  that's become kind of disturbing to me about it is how the the media works with a lot of these
[01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:18.640]  tech companies to smear and shame people and basically try to authorize them and they've
[01:57:18.640 --> 01:57:22.720]  tried that with me they've tried that obviously with you making things up about what you've said
[01:57:22.720 --> 01:57:27.920]  yeah making things up about what i've said removing context deleting things i mean it's really a
[01:57:27.920 --> 01:57:31.840]  oh i love the anonymous stuff like they said about you anonymously crapping on the floor or
[01:57:31.840 --> 01:57:36.640]  something they make up all the same stuff i'm thinking it'll say a guy said once he was walking
[01:57:36.640 --> 01:57:41.520]  down the hall in a movie theater and said he hated god or said he didn't believe in any of it or
[01:57:41.520 --> 01:57:47.840]  said he was of this or that they just have these anonymous made-up crap yeah it's it's interesting
[01:57:47.840 --> 01:57:52.800]  you know in the case of you know so gawkers smeared me we sued them uh but gawkers now in
[01:57:52.800 --> 01:57:56.560]  bankruptcy we're still fighting them over to get get a settlement out of them i saw they're offering
[01:57:56.560 --> 01:58:01.760]  you 1.5 million already but but that's not you know yeah so there's been a fight over that and we're
[01:58:01.760 --> 01:58:05.120]  we're going to see what's going to happen there and i promise the second i get that money we're
[01:58:05.120 --> 01:58:08.800]  just going to pour it right into suing twitter or suing one of these other companies i have no need
[01:58:08.800 --> 01:58:13.520]  for it i know we'll use that you will use the enemy's resources against them it shows how crazy
[01:58:13.520 --> 01:58:17.680]  they are because they do the set they just make up complete lies about me and my lawyer goes yes
[01:58:17.680 --> 01:58:22.480]  you will win this suit it'll just take you two years i i guess you've got a judgment 1.5 million
[01:58:22.480 --> 01:58:28.560]  right now but you want more i agree i think you need a lot more they just made up horrible things
[01:58:28.560 --> 01:58:32.320]  just like they made up about trump back in 70 seconds i want to do five more minutes and finally

[02:00:29.920 --> 02:00:37.520]  they're covering it this week give us the details sure i mean in 2012 matthew boil and i uh the
[02:00:37.520 --> 02:00:43.920]  daily caller broke a story about a u.s senator who was stiffing underage prostitutes and it ultimately
[02:00:43.920 --> 02:00:49.920]  led uh it ultimately led to a huge investigation about all the favors that the senator was doing
[02:00:49.920 --> 02:00:55.440]  on behalf of his friends this guy salmone mel jen who was running the one of the largest medicare
[02:00:55.440 --> 02:01:02.320]  frauds in american history and they got you know mel jen got convicted on all 67 counts of medicare
[02:01:02.320 --> 02:01:09.600]  fraud and now the u.s government uh the uh is prosecuting senator menendez for all the corrupt
[02:01:09.600 --> 02:01:15.680]  things he did on behalf of his friend who gave him all this money who you know went partying with him
[02:01:15.680 --> 02:01:21.360]  went went and visited all these women with him down in the dominican republic and uh it's been a
[02:01:21.360 --> 02:01:28.080]  really interesting trial because menendez tried to lie to people and say that he was you know pro
[02:01:28.080 --> 02:01:33.600]  you know he's basically against the iran deal he was a pro-israel democrat so a lot of um a lot of
[02:01:33.600 --> 02:01:39.680]  you know pro-israel people got conned and gave him a bunch of money for his legal defense but now
[02:01:39.680 --> 02:01:45.040]  the trial is going on it's gonna last for six weeks and i was the one who broke the story and uh
[02:01:45.040 --> 02:01:51.520]  it was kind of crazy how it all happened um what about the reports i heard years ago of him being
[02:01:51.520 --> 02:01:56.880]  investigated the allegations of underage so the underage stuff the the feds are not bringing
[02:01:56.880 --> 02:02:01.120]  the claims against that i've talked to some of the FBI agents about it and their attitude was look
[02:02:01.120 --> 02:02:06.080]  we've got more than enough to put this guy away i'm just straight up bribery and graft um but you
[02:02:06.080 --> 02:02:13.200]  know menendez menendez is a co-defendant mel jen you know he uh he had all these girlfriends many
[02:02:13.200 --> 02:02:23.440]  of them look like escorts they sound like escorts and yesterday um his menendez's staffer testified
[02:02:23.440 --> 02:02:28.480]  that he worked that he worked with menendez to bring in mel jen's girlfriends and this by the way
[02:02:28.480 --> 02:02:34.000]  is you know married guy um and he's bringing in all these women basically bringing them in under
[02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:38.880]  tourist visas so the real question is we know that he's doing this already those are just the ones
[02:02:38.880 --> 02:02:43.760]  that the governments brought brought the case on uh were there others you know we we you know we
[02:02:43.760 --> 02:02:49.920]  reported that there were uh in 2012 i was attacked by newsweek newsweek called me a used menendez's
[02:02:49.920 --> 02:02:55.120]  smear and said that it was a Cuban intelligence plot uh i was attacked for being anti-israel of
[02:02:55.120 --> 02:03:02.640]  course i'm not um and i was smeared for months and for years and then in 2015 the FBI came out
[02:03:02.640 --> 02:03:09.040]  and said that all the reporting that matthew boyle and i did uh or was corroborated was true
[02:03:09.040 --> 02:03:15.040]  and so um that's sort of a very fascinating place to be and it continues to be uh kind of exciting
[02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:23.200]  Chuck johnson let me ask you this final question we look at debbie washam and schultz now we have
[02:03:23.200 --> 02:03:27.840]  representative frank saying what we reported a week ago is accurate that they're seeking immunity for
[02:03:27.840 --> 02:03:32.080]  significant disturbing testimony against debbie washam and schultz what's the intel and i've
[02:03:32.080 --> 02:03:38.240]  got your ear to the ground uh on what she's been up to my so what i've been told is that
[02:03:38.240 --> 02:03:43.360]  it's not going to look good for her basically what they did was they really allowed foreign
[02:03:43.360 --> 02:03:50.000]  pakistani you know nationals to basically penetrate the entire the entire basically it system of the
[02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:55.840]  democratic party and um it's not looking good it's not looking good at all i think i think one of
[02:03:55.840 --> 02:04:01.200]  the problems that the democrats have in general is because they're so addicted to foreign labor
[02:04:01.200 --> 02:04:06.720]  and they're so addicted to like trying to human smuggle people into the country that they don't
[02:04:06.720 --> 02:04:11.200]  think about some of the security risks that some of these things pose like with the uh
[02:04:11.760 --> 02:04:15.920]  like with those brothers from pakistan that's right they think oh somebody from a foreign
[02:04:15.920 --> 02:04:20.400]  government like we know the russians were in there too in the chinese or the opposite personnel
[02:04:20.400 --> 02:04:25.200]  hack that was 20 million people i mean they're the ones doing this just everything's wide open
[02:04:25.200 --> 02:04:29.440]  while they point their fingers at us and say we're secret russian agents when we're the opposite
[02:04:29.440 --> 02:04:34.800]  no and honestly like you know i've never had any beef with russia in my entire life i
[02:04:34.800 --> 02:04:39.840]  wish them well they have a lot of hot women and coil you know but i'm not i'm not a paid
[02:04:39.840 --> 02:04:44.720]  paid by russia for anything um of course it's the globalists that are selling the country out
[02:04:44.720 --> 02:04:50.560]  chuck johnson thank you so much amazing information join us again as more unfolds with this trial

[02:05:59.760 --> 02:06:05.520]  would hear the drums of war giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a
[02:06:05.520 --> 02:06:12.960]  defense sixty years ago when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs they had drums
[02:06:12.960 --> 02:06:19.600]  of their own air raid sirens but in the 21st century there are silent weapons for quiet war
[02:06:19.600 --> 02:06:25.200]  pathogens added to the food and water into the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality

[02:08:31.280 --> 02:08:39.200]  i wanted to get professor james mccanney on for the next half hour because he's
[02:08:39.200 --> 02:08:44.800]  a high-level professor who has done a lot of different breakdowns on things that are happening
[02:08:44.800 --> 02:08:49.520]  in our environment things that are happening in our atmosphere things that are unfolding with
[02:08:49.520 --> 02:08:55.920]  weather modification american geospatial union meetings and you know other things that he's
[02:08:55.920 --> 02:09:02.960]  been part of i'm not going to go over his entire bio but you can find out more at j m c c s c i
[02:09:02.960 --> 02:09:10.800]  dot com or just google professor james mccanney mccanney before we go to him laura loomer
[02:09:11.840 --> 02:09:18.960]  is going out today and she is uh again just a free roving citizen journalist
[02:09:18.960 --> 02:09:23.760]  she's intending to go to book signings with hillary where they ask the question what happened
[02:09:24.320 --> 02:09:31.280]  she's gonna ask her what happened at benghazi uh what happened uh with the servers things like
[02:09:31.280 --> 02:09:36.400]  that she's gonna be joining us and we now have the excerpts we'll be playing because the the book
[02:09:36.400 --> 02:09:41.760]  on tape just came out a few days ago the excerpts of hillary attacking yours truly an info wars
[02:09:41.760 --> 02:09:47.840]  in the book with her own voice narrating it's very grating but we're going to be playing that coming
[02:09:47.840 --> 02:09:53.040]  up a little bit later towards the end of this hour and then paul watson from london england
[02:09:53.040 --> 02:09:59.200]  will be hosting the fourth hour with masses of key breaking news now i want to be clear
[02:09:59.200 --> 02:10:06.560]  here every time i cover a subject like this the media misrepresents and says that uh i am you know
[02:10:06.560 --> 02:10:12.800]  saying for sure that this is weather modified or that the government did this the government did
[02:10:12.800 --> 02:10:17.840]  that all i know is they admit they've got a lot of these systems uh the former secretary of defense
[02:10:17.840 --> 02:10:22.560]  william cohen back in april of 1997 gave a press conference and admitted it
[02:10:22.560 --> 02:10:32.560]  so we should have a debate about this the ultimate class system is this whole national
[02:10:32.560 --> 02:10:38.960]  security in our global security system where the upper class gets into the cult of secret
[02:10:38.960 --> 02:10:43.760]  government corporations and then they travel up that to the corporate or military ladder
[02:10:43.760 --> 02:10:48.400]  and then they get access to what's going on at least pieces of it but the public doesn't
[02:10:48.400 --> 02:10:53.200]  and only the people up at the very very top get to then see how all the pieces are fitting together
[02:10:54.400 --> 02:10:58.880]  that's real discrimination that's control of knowledge and professor james mccanney
[02:10:58.880 --> 02:11:03.680]  breaks that down i'm not going to go over all the things he's done and all the things he's been
[02:11:03.680 --> 02:11:10.800]  involved in uh but i'd like to uh just get his general take on where we are globally right now
[02:11:11.760 --> 02:11:15.840]  we've got all the kuiper belt objects they're now admitting more of those come to the solar system
[02:11:15.840 --> 02:11:21.840]  we've got massive record earthquakes mexico was going to help in the situation in texas
[02:11:21.840 --> 02:11:26.080]  with harvey until they got hit with the biggest earthquake in their history why does all this
[02:11:26.080 --> 02:11:30.720]  connect together what's going on with the stone of the sign we'll get his perspective we've been
[02:11:30.720 --> 02:11:36.960]  having astrophysicists on lately you name it uh to give us their take to professor james mccanney
[02:11:36.960 --> 02:11:42.880]  thanks for coming on thanks alex thanks for having me here so you're really the super expert on
[02:11:42.880 --> 02:11:48.960]  everything give us your breakdown just on what you think is most important well alex the i work
[02:11:48.960 --> 02:11:55.840]  with russian scientists in the mid 1990s and what we developed were systems two systems for degrading
[02:11:55.840 --> 02:12:01.440]  hurricanes leading them offshore and this information was given to the u.s military because russia
[02:12:01.440 --> 02:12:06.480]  really doesn't have a problem with hurricanes we do and the u.s military we knew that they had
[02:12:06.480 --> 02:12:13.040]  militarized this information in the early 2000s they sent up three large satellites they said
[02:12:13.040 --> 02:12:17.520]  they were for communications we knew that that they were laser satellites and they have been
[02:12:17.520 --> 02:12:22.160]  using these to manipulate storms that's when the serious storm manipulation problem began
[02:12:22.880 --> 02:12:28.560]  and uh the way they do this uh hurricanes we first have to dispel this myth that hurricanes are
[02:12:28.560 --> 02:12:34.960]  somehow created uh created and maintained by warm water totally incorrect the hurricanes are powered
[02:12:34.960 --> 02:12:40.640]  by electrical currents from the ionosphere and what we learned is how to enhance and use those
[02:12:40.640 --> 02:12:47.280]  currents to steer hurricanes away from shore and away from harm of the public now they're using
[02:12:47.280 --> 02:12:54.320]  these and you could see it with hurricane irma was uh built and designed in eastern atlantic
[02:12:54.320 --> 02:13:00.560]  and just guided across that's why these hurricane models supposedly uh predicted where they were
[02:13:00.560 --> 02:13:08.160]  going to go up florida days almost a week in advance it's absurd but they this was one of the
[02:13:08.160 --> 02:13:14.160]  most manipulated guided storms i've ever seen along with hurricane katrina which was a totally
[02:13:14.160 --> 02:13:21.600]  manipulated storm for maximum destruction this was to destroy florida evacuate florida just
[02:13:21.600 --> 02:13:27.600]  as hurricane harvey was to destroy houston you know we could pull up time lapse of hurricane
[02:13:27.600 --> 02:13:34.000]  katrina's uh satellite or also radar composites and it comes in out of the atlantic it goes up the
[02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:40.000]  side sits there and waits a couple days and then races across and goes right into louisiana and
[02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:46.080]  again i had been living stood on the father of a lot of our modern weather weapons and it was
[02:13:46.080 --> 02:13:51.680]  declassified i saw his name in a newspaper called him got him on he got a visit a week after and he
[02:13:51.680 --> 02:13:55.920]  told me said i can't ever talk to anybody again they've reclassified it they just threatened me
[02:13:55.920 --> 02:14:00.880]  but he said they had systems that control hurricanes and steer them and or kill them
[02:14:00.880 --> 02:14:11.440]  back in the 1960s the what you have is a low pressure cell and part of the manipulation
[02:14:11.440 --> 02:14:17.040]  is to manipulate the public into believing that this is caused by warm water and so if the public
[02:14:17.040 --> 02:14:23.120]  doesn't understand the true nature of hurricanes now we're seeing on the screen here look at the
[02:14:23.120 --> 02:14:29.360]  eye is this katrina i'm assuming this is katrina uh yeah it came in and i just read some analysis
[02:14:29.360 --> 02:14:35.520]  from some weather reporters how they were totally taken by surprise at the path and the strength
[02:14:35.520 --> 02:14:43.840]  and even of katrina it was totally off off the records it was totally out of control but it was
[02:14:43.840 --> 02:14:50.960]  being controlled by for maximum destruction of new orleans and look we have no record of maybe
[02:14:50.960 --> 02:14:55.760]  millions of people that were in new orleans i used to live in new orleans i went to tulain for grad
[02:14:55.760 --> 02:15:03.920]  school and i wrote all around the levees the hurricane katrina had already passed new orleans
[02:15:03.920 --> 02:15:09.360]  when they blew the levee in seven places the flooding was a result of blown levees from
[02:15:09.360 --> 02:15:14.880]  explosions not from back surge from hurricane katrina you're saying it was used for social
[02:15:14.880 --> 02:15:21.840]  engineering i guess is an example of how to use weather weapons to then clear an area exactly we
[02:15:21.840 --> 02:15:27.200]  don't know what happened how many i'm possibly a million people in new orleans we have no record of
[02:15:27.200 --> 02:15:31.760]  by the way they call it a conspiracy theory that levees got blown they later admitted that they did
[02:15:31.760 --> 02:15:37.200]  release some of the levees they did indeed blow some of the levees yeah i rode my bicycle around
[02:15:37.200 --> 02:15:43.200]  those levees as a as a student i was i know those levees like the back of my hand and for the
[02:15:43.200 --> 02:15:51.280]  the the concept that these were destroyed by a back surge off lake poncha train totally absurd
[02:15:52.160 --> 02:15:56.720]  these were blown to flood the city because normally these levees you can like you said a
[02:15:56.720 --> 02:16:02.720]  bicycle they're like what 10 12 feet wide oh yeah they're massive they're massive yeah there's a
[02:16:02.720 --> 02:16:07.920]  hurricane surge is not going to take these levees out and we know that they were blown
[02:16:07.920 --> 02:16:13.760]  in the lower wards where the the by the way we know gun confiscation happened they denied that for
[02:16:13.760 --> 02:16:18.640]  a week it was later admitted and just like the us virgin islands confiscated all the guns the
[02:16:18.640 --> 02:16:26.560]  us virgin islands governor took the guns just last week again right and uh there's again a
[02:16:26.560 --> 02:16:32.000]  hurricane irma destroyed these islands and uh there was no need to do this now irma was a
[02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:37.120]  perfectly example where they could have used the same technology to direct the storm north
[02:16:37.120 --> 02:16:42.080]  into the center of the atlantic completely out of harm's way and they drug it across
[02:16:42.080 --> 02:16:47.520]  interestingly enough they brought it way north of port urico and then brought it back down
[02:16:47.520 --> 02:16:54.880]  into hispanola to uh dominican republic ad and then cuba for maximum destruction and then it takes
[02:16:54.880 --> 02:17:02.160]  a right turn exactly perfectly to come up the west coast of florida and they did that to maximize
[02:17:02.160 --> 02:17:09.840]  the energy and the uh storm surge and but they made a mistake they could not maintain the energy
[02:17:09.840 --> 02:17:14.320]  in the storm you could see i'm pulling it i've posted a picture by the way on my web page isn't
[02:17:14.320 --> 02:17:18.240]  that because they're even admitting that because those bays are so shallow that they didn't get
[02:17:18.240 --> 02:17:25.840]  enough water yeah yeah and the the other thing they made irma so big that it dumped most of its
[02:17:25.840 --> 02:17:30.800]  water out in the ocean so it didn't have much rain it was a dry hurricane by the time it got to
[02:17:30.800 --> 02:17:37.840]  tampa so it did not have much momentum and uh so they failed they you could see them bringing it
[02:17:37.840 --> 02:17:43.360]  into shore and then bringing it back out into the into the bays along the west coast of florida
[02:17:43.360 --> 02:17:48.480]  trying to bring up energy drive up energy and you could see the distortion in the eye as they were
[02:17:48.480 --> 02:17:55.440]  doing this uh but if they failed it uh it shorted out it did not have much of a storm surge and it
[02:17:55.440 --> 02:17:59.280]  had very well that's the bottom line about weather weapons whether they did this or not and i'm not
[02:17:59.280 --> 02:18:03.840]  disagreeing with you professor they have the technology that's declassified they admit they're
[02:18:03.840 --> 02:18:10.000]  doing it and they admit they're testing so of course they legalize it under us code title 50
[02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:17.520]  chapter 32 subsection 1528 paragraph b chemical biological radiological weather any type of secret
[02:18:17.520 --> 02:18:23.600]  testing as long as it's for research purposes so it's never operational all these giant programs
[02:18:23.600 --> 02:18:28.880]  they still call them they still call them research just like Tuskegee and injecting black people
[02:18:28.880 --> 02:18:36.080]  with cephalus well if nothing else they should have steered this storm northwards in and in the
[02:18:36.080 --> 02:18:42.720]  atlantic away from any harm so i know they have the ability to do this so why didn't they do this
[02:18:42.720 --> 02:18:48.400]  why did they directed into florida and then governor rick scott is and cnn pounding everybody has to
[02:18:48.400 --> 02:18:55.120]  evacuate everybody has to evacuate they were going for maximum damage in florida and uh
[02:18:55.120 --> 02:19:00.080]  that would have depopulated florida as it turns out a lot of people stayed there are people back
[02:19:00.080 --> 02:19:06.240]  in business i know people in tampa that are back at the office today and uh so they failed they
[02:19:06.240 --> 02:19:11.680]  failed at their objective it's incredible to see tampa bay and other areas that leon mackinac
[02:19:11.680 --> 02:19:19.280]  who shot video as well walking out hundreds of yards just no water right yeah and there was no
[02:19:19.280 --> 02:19:25.440]  storm surge uh it it was very minimal and so all of that underground infrastructure that should
[02:19:25.440 --> 02:19:32.000]  have been damaged was not incredible professor james mccanney is our guest we're going to get his
[02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:37.520]  view on though a lot of this is secret what's the big picture and i want to be clear i'm not saying
[02:19:37.520 --> 02:19:41.520]  this is controlled i'm not i'm not saying i disagree with him i'm not saying i agree i think
[02:19:41.520 --> 02:19:45.360]  it's open for discussion he's a smart professor there's a lot of research and we're getting his
[02:19:45.360 --> 02:19:50.080]  view on this but we know they've got weather modification and they're manipulating hurricanes

[02:24:09.120 --> 02:24:12.880]  audiobook for us we're gonna be playing those remember she called me the dark heart
[02:24:13.520 --> 02:24:19.520]  and she said that i'd lost her the election and what's crazy is you lost her the election you
[02:24:19.520 --> 02:24:26.080]  voted against her not the russians not when i did vote against her but again they want to make the
[02:24:26.080 --> 02:24:34.560]  symbol alex jones blame me and then try to destroy me in some media ritual it's not gonna work that
[02:24:34.560 --> 02:24:39.520]  articles up on info wars dot com with the video with the audio and with the transcript of her new
[02:24:39.520 --> 02:24:43.840]  book hillary clinton obsessed with alex jones a new book so i love how they're attacking me
[02:24:43.840 --> 02:24:49.120]  everywhere trying to destroy me everywhere and then trying to censor me while they create all
[02:24:49.120 --> 02:24:55.040]  these strawman characters on tv but say i'm alex jones reporting and i don't like such and such
[02:24:55.040 --> 02:25:03.600]  and then say something bigoted i mean the fact that it works on leftist tv viewers is terrified
[02:25:03.600 --> 02:25:11.280]  dead this is the level of their constituent they don't play what i ever say when tom brokaw says
[02:25:11.280 --> 02:25:18.000]  i'm a deep racist or complete racist they just say i am as if the thing makes it so like i am
[02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:25.280]  puff the magic dragon no i'm not alex jones is a nazi no i'm not alex jones is a purple walrus no i'm
[02:25:25.280 --> 02:25:34.560]  not the fact is professor james mccanny is right there are weather weapons it's admitted they've
[02:25:34.560 --> 02:25:40.160]  got it and i love how it's all over the news in foreign countries that they've got ionizing systems
[02:25:40.160 --> 02:25:46.240]  on the ground jets spray planes they're doing it they admitted in dubai and china but here
[02:25:46.240 --> 02:25:50.320]  they just say oh you're crazy so in a few minutes we've got left one of the fight yep for a full
[02:25:50.320 --> 02:25:57.200]  hour in the near future what's really going on because i mean so much of this is secret we
[02:25:57.200 --> 02:26:04.000]  know it's going on but what's the end game well alex i believe that they lost the election they
[02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:09.920]  don't know what to do with trump this is a symbol of desperate people doing desperate thing my view
[02:26:09.920 --> 02:26:16.800]  is this is the deep state this is clearly the us military that is in control of this and we're
[02:26:16.800 --> 02:26:23.600]  looking at two population centers what i am worried about are other things like the canary islands
[02:26:23.600 --> 02:26:30.800]  forcing a landslide or causing earthquakes on the new madras fault line or the san andreas
[02:26:30.800 --> 02:26:38.560]  or messing with yellowstone we already know that nasa has proposed pumping steam into yellowstone
[02:26:38.560 --> 02:26:45.520]  and luckily the the park services said stay away but that would create the biggest volcanic
[02:26:45.520 --> 02:26:52.240]  explosion we've ever seen in the world but exactly why that that that wasn't the associated press
[02:26:52.240 --> 02:26:57.440]  why are the super caldera is going on would you pump steam back in it knowing that that's what
[02:26:57.440 --> 02:27:04.880]  causes it to explode well they they think it's the the gas that's in the volcano they you know
[02:27:04.880 --> 02:27:09.680]  standard theory says that that's what caused the explosion no it's when the water goes down
[02:27:09.680 --> 02:27:14.560]  hits the magma and you got the biggest steam engine on the planet but i'm worried about
[02:27:14.560 --> 02:27:22.960]  false flag emps where they shut down they pull the electrical grid you know the the number of
[02:27:22.960 --> 02:27:27.760]  rabbits that they have in their hats but these are desperate people doing desperate things and
[02:27:27.760 --> 02:27:32.720]  of course the pentagon's got the 20 year old document owning the weather by 2025 i mean i don't
[02:27:32.720 --> 02:27:39.680]  hide this absolutely no this is absolutely here there's no question that hurricane irma was manipulated
[02:27:39.680 --> 02:27:45.280]  look the other thing is you need a real energy system to drive these storms there was no natural
[02:27:45.920 --> 02:27:49.920]  existing that's my question are they using aerosols or electromagnetic ground based
[02:27:50.720 --> 02:27:55.200]  well this is from laser satellites what they do is they enhance the electrical currents that
[02:27:55.200 --> 02:27:59.040]  are driving the storm i know you've been saying that for 20 years all all i could have approved
[02:27:59.040 --> 02:28:03.840]  was ground base and airbase now they got the movie super storm or geostorm coming out where it is
[02:28:03.840 --> 02:28:09.520]  space space lasers just like you first said yeah and i developed the techniques i developed the
[02:28:09.520 --> 02:28:16.160]  processes and the idea was to steer these away from land and you can see it when they talk about
[02:28:16.160 --> 02:28:21.760]  double walls this is the stretching of the eye due to the laser and even the new you know i forgot
[02:28:21.760 --> 02:28:26.400]  how many years ago did i hear you on was it coast to coast to your own show how about space
[02:28:26.400 --> 02:28:31.280]  space lasers and and either you're right about that or they copy you for the new movie geostorm
[02:28:31.280 --> 02:28:40.240]  because i mean it's just it's just crazy i mean it's wild yeah but that's like i say you have to
[02:28:40.240 --> 02:28:45.520]  first understand hurricanes are not driven by warm water that's ludicrous that's like saying that the
[02:28:45.520 --> 02:28:52.640]  gas coming out of your tailpipe pushes your car down the road it's ludicrous but they keep driving
[02:28:52.640 --> 02:28:58.560]  this what are they driven by usually solar radiation coming in well the earth has electrical fields
[02:28:58.560 --> 02:29:03.680]  between the ionosphere and ground and typically they're blocked by the uh dielectric properties
[02:29:03.680 --> 02:29:09.200]  of the atmosphere but when you get these big cloud systems rolling off africa it's like a finger
[02:29:09.200 --> 02:29:15.760]  sticking up and once that electrical discharge begins that's when the hurricane the eyes form the
[02:29:15.760 --> 02:29:20.880]  ionization so basically really tall clouds pierce the earth atmosphere shield and bring in the space
[02:29:20.880 --> 02:29:26.080]  space particle electricity yep and and if you learn how if that's the process and you enhance
[02:29:26.080 --> 02:29:31.040]  that with a laser you're driving the hurricane you're gonna get it the lasers those punch a hole
[02:29:31.040 --> 02:29:37.040]  through simply for the connection to begin you enhance the the electrical current that's what
[02:29:37.040 --> 02:29:41.360]  you're doing do five more minutes with you if you can because i'm gonna play the trailer for geostorm
[02:29:41.360 --> 02:29:48.160]  coming out on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:29:48.160 --> 02:29:58.480]  prepping for disaster and societal unrest has now gone so mainstream that even realtor.com is
[02:29:58.480 --> 02:30:02.880]  writing about it but the realtors are still embarrassed to cover the subject and eager to set
[02:30:02.880 --> 02:30:08.400]  themselves apart from what they call uncle travis's guns and canned foods militia vision of preparedness
[02:30:08.400 --> 02:30:13.520]  well the ants may have the last laugh on the grasshoppers but the grasshoppers will still
[02:30:13.520 --> 02:30:17.760]  sing the tune if they can make money but maybe you don't have a hollywood mansion where you can
[02:30:17.760 --> 02:30:22.400]  drop another million dollars to turn your home theater into a radiation proof bunker there are
[02:30:22.400 --> 02:30:28.560]  still very effective low-tech low-cost things you can do to prepare in fact even realizing that there's
[02:30:28.560 --> 02:30:34.320]  a need to prepare and doing anything to act on that realization increases your chances of survival

[02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:20.480]  i've been hearing professor james mccanney for it's gotta be 20 years i'm going from memory
[02:33:20.480 --> 02:33:25.440]  i think he's been on the show before but i gotta be honest i remember him talking and i know he's
[02:33:25.440 --> 02:33:30.320]  big engineer and we're probably his big companies and spoke at these big geophysical union meetings
[02:33:30.320 --> 02:33:34.560]  and all the rest of it and lectured at los alamos laboratory i mean he's the real deal
[02:33:34.560 --> 02:33:39.360]  but i hear him talk about they've got space based systems with lasers and then that drives the
[02:33:39.360 --> 02:33:43.760]  hurricanes and then allows the connectivity and back then i was like that just sounded too fancy
[02:33:44.640 --> 02:33:50.000]  but then as i interviewed astrophysicists everybody else they explained that the atmosphere
[02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:54.400]  keeps all that ionizing radiation and all these different types of particles and different types
[02:33:54.400 --> 02:34:01.120]  of energy from getting into the earth and now they have cbs news shows as i'm showing on tv here
[02:34:01.120 --> 02:34:08.800]  where cbs admits weather modification lasers are in operation and then on cbs they say we have in
[02:34:08.800 --> 02:34:15.600]  fact let's try to queue that up later mega lasers they say these super high powered lasers where we
[02:34:15.600 --> 02:34:20.960]  control the storms and where we can destroy the storms or make them bigger and the cbs host says
[02:34:20.960 --> 02:34:25.760]  to the professor famous physics professor oh wait you mean in the laboratory was oh yes of
[02:34:25.760 --> 02:34:30.400]  course laboratory so then i would think back to mccanney talking about the russians and the lasers
[02:34:30.400 --> 02:34:35.840]  and all the rest of it again it's that the laser even if it's ground-based to be super powerful
[02:34:35.840 --> 02:34:43.760]  space base moderately so opens up that channel simply for the connection so whether it's one
[02:34:43.760 --> 02:34:49.680]  little copper wire or one little laser it still allows i guess the trough to open is what i've
[02:34:49.680 --> 02:34:55.040]  been now actually reading the physics i'm not a you know a physics guy i can now understand it i
[02:34:55.040 --> 02:34:59.200]  guess at 43 years old and then it's like oh i get it because i was like why not have ground-based
[02:34:59.200 --> 02:35:03.760]  doing it it needs to be up in space to open the channel instead of shooting up through all the
[02:35:03.760 --> 02:35:08.560]  water it's like 10 feet of water on average up in the space if you condense the atmosphere
[02:35:08.560 --> 02:35:14.000]  you've got to open it up from the top where it's clean it's a lot easier to pierce and then it makes
[02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:19.760]  the connection so now i remember this guy on shows 15 20 years ago talking about it and rolling my
[02:35:19.760 --> 02:35:25.360]  eyes and then now wow they've got this film coming out like a month and i'm not advertising for it
[02:35:25.360 --> 02:35:31.600]  i'm just showing this is everything everybody's been talking about and now here it is what is
[02:35:31.600 --> 02:35:36.560]  it like to see josh brolin all these other big stars in a movie about world government
[02:35:36.560 --> 02:35:38.720]  and weather terrorism here it is
[02:35:44.880 --> 02:35:50.800]  senate committee now here from jacob lawson climate iss chief coordinator may the record
[02:35:50.800 --> 02:35:56.480]  reflect that he was nearly one hour late yeah sorry about that i literally had to fly in from outer
[02:35:56.480 --> 02:36:04.560]  space thanks to the system of satellites natural disasters have become a thing of the past
[02:36:08.480 --> 02:36:09.920]  we can control our weather
[02:36:11.680 --> 02:36:15.840]  mr president one of our thermospheric satellites malfunctioned over at gannister
[02:36:15.840 --> 02:36:21.840]  so your proposal is what we shut down all satellites i don't need to remind all of you
[02:36:21.840 --> 02:36:26.560]  how many people died from catastrophic climate conditions make sure there's no further incidents
[02:36:27.200 --> 02:36:33.840]  are you going back up to space we're going back i promise have a safe trip sir just don't touch
[02:36:33.840 --> 02:36:47.120]  anything this is mr jake lawson three jake lawson you look much older than i would have thought i mean
[02:36:47.120 --> 02:36:55.200]  do you look good am i getting fired my axis has been blocked so sally has a bad car that happens
[02:36:55.200 --> 02:37:12.160]  all the time like we are of all these high-powered particles all the space in the electricity
[02:37:12.160 --> 02:37:16.720]  so let's just stop right there you watch the trailer shows you in troops all over the world
[02:37:16.720 --> 02:37:23.040]  that's the condition you have you in not just in blue helmets blue uniforms okay and it just shows
[02:37:23.040 --> 02:37:27.440]  a global authority dealing with the problem so it's all conditioning they're just rolling it out
[02:37:27.440 --> 02:37:34.240]  and i got to say james mccanney uh you sounded sincere i did research over the years and then
[02:37:34.240 --> 02:37:39.520]  now you were the first guy who talked about space space control now i get it spend a few more minutes
[02:37:39.520 --> 02:37:45.120]  talking about this elix you hit it right in the head when you talked about the funnel
[02:37:45.120 --> 02:37:49.680]  see the dielectric of the atmosphere and this is what tesla was doing tesla back in the early
[02:37:49.680 --> 02:37:56.160]  1900s was tapping into this that's what he was using his tesla towers for they were a mechanism for
[02:37:56.160 --> 02:38:01.760]  down on the planet earth drilling up through what i call drilling through the atmosphere
[02:38:01.760 --> 02:38:07.840]  and once you do you can unload that power electrical it's like a space elevator we know the fbi
[02:38:07.840 --> 02:38:12.320]  rated him was probably killed working for jp morgan rated him to get all his technology
[02:38:12.320 --> 02:38:19.200]  exactly in the there was george bush senior who was in that when he was a young guy when
[02:38:19.200 --> 02:38:26.240]  uh him and scorda what's the guy's name scorda scords corvinsky yeah who actually supposedly
[02:38:26.240 --> 02:38:31.840]  suffocated tesla and george bush senior well that was out in colorado that was out in colorado
[02:38:32.400 --> 02:38:38.320]  no the uh the the tesla died in his new york hotel sure but i'm saying they also see everything
[02:38:38.320 --> 02:38:43.280]  out in colorado exactly and took down the warden cliff tower that was they said to keep it from
[02:38:43.280 --> 02:38:50.800]  the germans well uh that was ridiculous they took it down because it was a way to get free energy
[02:38:50.800 --> 02:38:56.720]  from not in the sense of putting a box on the table and getting free energy but literally getting
[02:38:57.360 --> 02:39:02.560]  existing massive amounts of energy to drive technology by the way they now admit this in
[02:39:02.560 --> 02:39:06.800]  all the major tech publications in science that they could put big satellites out there that grab
[02:39:06.800 --> 02:39:11.840]  the radiation of the sun not just the regular heat but again once you're not having the atmosphere
[02:39:11.840 --> 02:39:18.000]  our defensive bubble uh it's how many times more strong on average out in space oh it's uh
[02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:21.600]  tremendous amount you have the entire spectrum because we're dealing with just the visible
[02:39:21.600 --> 02:39:26.800]  spectrum down here you have the all the way from the infrared the microwaves and all the way up to
[02:39:26.800 --> 02:39:31.840]  x-rays so you have tremendous amount of energy to trap but you alex you're exactly right you've
[02:39:31.840 --> 02:39:37.120]  got it right on the head from above you can see down the eye you put the laser there you just
[02:39:37.120 --> 02:39:42.000]  you can drag these things around like a bowl with a ring in its nose you can increase the
[02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:47.280]  energy you can decrease their energy but the point is these storms should never have hit any
[02:39:47.280 --> 02:39:54.160]  landfall at all uh by the way certified with old technology they can control of sheer hurricanes
[02:39:54.160 --> 02:40:00.160]  1967 stanford research men livingston meteorologist secret uh air force navy program
[02:40:00.160 --> 02:40:05.600]  declassified 2006 certified they can control them with old technology why aren't they staring
[02:40:05.600 --> 02:40:11.360]  them out to sea absolutely absolutely but i'm wondering also i i think i probably should
[02:40:11.360 --> 02:40:17.680]  have got some royalties from this movie well tell us about the laser technology is that from the
[02:40:17.680 --> 02:40:22.880]  russian research you worked on or others yeah that's where we developed it in the russian
[02:40:22.880 --> 02:40:29.520]  scientists were very advanced uh the university in novosibirsk uh lexidimetry of alex tetanoff
[02:40:29.520 --> 02:40:35.440]  and the crew there and uh i was lucky enough to be associated with them and the reason they wanted
[02:40:35.440 --> 02:40:40.560]  my theoretical work is because they were observing this and they didn't know what was causing it so
[02:40:40.560 --> 02:40:46.240]  then they understood it they broke it down we said okay now we can use this because it's like it's
[02:40:46.240 --> 02:40:52.240]  like a trigger it's like a having this uh energy system and now you can control it so you can
[02:40:52.240 --> 02:40:57.760]  control tornadoes you can move tornadoes around tornadoes are the same so they're simply tapping
[02:40:57.760 --> 02:41:03.200]  into the incredible amount of energy in space absolutely and then pouring it into the earth
[02:41:03.200 --> 02:41:09.840]  directing it where they want with lasers exactly exactly you're taking a natural process and enhancing
[02:41:09.840 --> 02:41:15.600]  it that's what you're doing we know that 90 percent of the space program is secret i know you worked
[02:41:15.600 --> 02:41:20.240]  on you know some university programs and things and most of those are DARPA funds you can't get
[02:41:20.240 --> 02:41:28.400]  into that but how extensive from your research is this uh it's pervasive uh the you know of course
[02:41:28.400 --> 02:41:36.000]  the military objective is to control everything but a long time ago we decided not to militarize space
[02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:41.600]  the same russian scientists in around 2001 once we realized the u.s was sending up these laser
[02:41:41.600 --> 02:41:47.600]  satellites they went to the united nations and wanted a treaty the un wrote up a treaty for
[02:41:47.600 --> 02:41:53.840]  space based weather based systems and the u.s refused to sign it i remember that uh yeah and
[02:41:53.840 --> 02:41:58.000]  that was the same group of people but then they attack us and say we're crazy even though i've
[02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:03.680]  got all the proposed treaties all the stuff you talk about's been in the news now yeah yeah absolutely
[02:42:03.680 --> 02:42:10.720]  and so the u.s the reason the u.s didn't sign that because they wouldn't sign a part that we
[02:42:10.720 --> 02:42:16.400]  that would not allow them to use it against their own people that's why the u.s did not sign it and
[02:42:16.400 --> 02:42:21.920]  that's what they're doing that's they're using this against the american population and one
[02:42:21.920 --> 02:42:26.320]  way they're covering it up in scientific america and all these tech magazines here that we all see
[02:42:26.320 --> 02:42:30.480]  at the book stands and i've bought many times as they go oh we're gonna harness power from space
[02:42:30.480 --> 02:42:35.440]  they show these bigger rays that grab the power and then it shows a laser that beams it back
[02:42:35.440 --> 02:42:40.320]  to a power station on earth but then i remember reading more and going wait a minute they're
[02:42:40.320 --> 02:42:44.800]  gonna open up a connection through the atmosphere will that bleed off atmosphere what will that do
[02:42:44.800 --> 02:42:50.400]  to have giant lasers constantly shooting back down to power plants on earth through the atmosphere
[02:42:51.040 --> 02:42:56.720]  well you can open up a channel to that ionosphere it's it the lasers can ionize the air and just
[02:42:56.720 --> 02:43:04.480]  like lightning at first ionizes a path and then the the uh energy comes down and so you cannot do
[02:43:04.480 --> 02:43:10.400]  this you can't cannot have space elevators you cannot have lasers shining through the the second
[02:43:10.400 --> 02:43:15.680]  shuttle accident was a laser beam hitting that you could see that i saw a video taken by a
[02:43:16.320 --> 02:43:20.880]  a guy out in california whose hobby it was to take video that even came out in the san francisco
[02:43:20.880 --> 02:43:25.920]  chronicle and they raided the gobiest house the videotape the green laser hitting and then it
[02:43:25.920 --> 02:43:32.720]  vaporizing why do you think they blew up the shuttle i don't know i have no i if i could get
[02:43:32.720 --> 02:43:37.440]  into these people's heads i you know i'd probably write a book on it but they're crazy well they
[02:43:37.440 --> 02:43:40.720]  wanted to end this so they wanted to end the shuttle program so they they just did that to
[02:43:40.720 --> 02:43:48.080]  have a bang but but expanding on this as we talk more about this it's just crazy to realize that
[02:43:48.080 --> 02:43:52.800]  in pop culture they admit it in science culture they admit it but they never give the real reason
[02:43:52.800 --> 02:44:00.960]  for it and now it's just hiding in plain view wow yeah exactly it's in plain view and um
[02:44:00.960 --> 02:44:05.680]  when i started talking about this in public like you say people thought yeah this guy's crazy you
[02:44:05.680 --> 02:44:11.840]  know said laser satellites and uh but what's amazing to me alex is they keep pumping this idea on the
[02:44:11.840 --> 02:44:18.640]  news on the news media on the the fake weather news uh that hurricanes are caused by warm water
[02:44:18.640 --> 02:44:24.080]  it's absurd there's there's no mechanism to get energy from warm water into a hurricane
[02:44:24.080 --> 02:44:32.080]  or maintain it that's a thermodynamic impossibility it's absurd uh but i heard a million times the
[02:44:32.080 --> 02:44:35.920]  weathermen keep uh though it's when i don't understand what you're saying is there's
[02:44:35.920 --> 02:44:41.200]  clearly tall enough clouds get up into the ionosphere energy comes in it's transforming
[02:44:41.200 --> 02:44:46.800]  more nuclei start spinning it has more energy then well the ions that are down around the
[02:44:47.440 --> 02:44:52.800]  as these storm systems move across africa the electrical currents are going down to ground
[02:44:52.800 --> 02:44:57.520]  as soon as they move out over the ocean there's no ground anymore it's just ionized air at the
[02:44:57.520 --> 02:45:03.280]  surface of the ocean and those start to spin and try and find a path upwards and when they do
[02:45:03.280 --> 02:45:09.040]  that's where the eye forms the eye typically forms at the very tallest part of the cumulonimbus clouds
[02:45:09.040 --> 02:45:14.240]  and that's what's connecting the electrons that's the electrons absolutely i've had astrophysicists
[02:45:14.240 --> 02:45:19.200]  on they agree with you but again that's what's crazy mainline science admits all this but you
[02:45:19.200 --> 02:45:25.680]  turn on the news they're like talking to us like we're five years old yeah why why this pretend
[02:45:25.680 --> 02:45:33.520]  weathered news and you know that tornadoes are caused by clouds rubbing together what you know
[02:45:33.520 --> 02:45:40.800]  this is it's absurd tornadoes are caused by the same electrical phenomenon and we could use that
[02:45:40.800 --> 02:45:46.720]  energy like with tesla towers to extract that energy from the ionosphere although it's really
[02:45:46.720 --> 02:45:51.920]  it's pretty dangerous thing to do well professor james mechanic i am so impressed and i just there's
[02:45:51.920 --> 02:45:56.480]  so much to research and so much to know but uh there's just so much happening and it's
[02:45:56.480 --> 02:46:01.680]  talk about the total class system of this whole secret global scientific and military industrial
[02:46:01.680 --> 02:46:07.120]  elite that eisenhower warned of and now this is the new super elite class and they decided they
[02:46:07.120 --> 02:46:12.320]  want to depopulate the earth because they're god like a moon raker ean flaming novel we'll talk
[02:46:12.320 --> 02:46:20.000]  to you soon thank you so much thanks alex well that was powerful if hillary clinton's so
[02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:26.640]  so invincible why was she worried about little old alex shoes well they knew our audience was
[02:46:26.640 --> 02:46:31.120]  exposing her and they knew that we were one of the most viral news sites and radio slash tv shows
[02:46:31.120 --> 02:46:36.480]  exposing her but they thought what we were saying was radical sounding and that if they
[02:46:36.480 --> 02:46:42.480]  made info wars the poster child for donald trump and nationalism people would turn against it
[02:46:43.360 --> 02:46:49.760]  but that's in their ivory tower coastal elites mindset where they hate christians and hate god
[02:46:49.760 --> 02:46:55.920]  and hate orthodox jews and just basically hate anybody that isn't a devil worshipper and what
[02:46:55.920 --> 02:47:01.120]  ended up happening is it blew up in their face and they still don't get it though the more
[02:47:01.120 --> 02:47:06.720]  they demonize this the more they attack us people know they're the enemy so here's her earlier
[02:47:06.720 --> 02:47:11.920]  comments there's been a lot this year where she blamed me for losing the election and then of
[02:47:11.920 --> 02:47:17.920]  course she called me the dark heart during the election and all they've done is raise the profile
[02:47:17.920 --> 02:47:23.840]  of info wars but it's a strange thing while they raise the profile they also try to censor our
[02:47:23.840 --> 02:47:30.880]  actual articles our actual videos and what we've actually said so they're trying to destroy the
[02:47:30.880 --> 02:47:36.160]  image of info wars so no we are your champion i don't want to be your champion i don't have
[02:47:36.160 --> 02:47:41.520]  all the answers i'm a humble person but they've chosen to make us the figurehead of the liberty
[02:47:41.520 --> 02:47:50.240]  movement so understand if they can destroy us they're coming after you next so i am now you
[02:47:50.240 --> 02:47:58.160]  you are now me we are now together we are now one they hate you they see was bitter clingers
[02:47:58.160 --> 02:48:02.320]  flyover country they want to dominate you they want to control it because they know you're good
[02:48:02.320 --> 02:48:08.720]  it's spiritual they have chosen little old me as the person they want to destroy
[02:48:08.720 --> 02:48:15.760]  so i'm looking for your prayer more than anything now here is this witch this woman with child
[02:48:15.760 --> 02:48:20.800]  traffickers all around her funding the arab spring mass murder of christians all their crimes
[02:48:20.800 --> 02:48:26.000]  here they are thinking arrogantly madame president newsweek had already printed up the magazine covers
[02:48:27.600 --> 02:48:33.680]  but it blew up in their face because they're not god they're not invincible they're just
[02:48:33.680 --> 02:48:39.360]  narcissistic megalomaniacs that think they are and we called their bluff we told them filled
[02:48:39.360 --> 02:48:44.880]  their hand politically we've beaten them so far and we'll beat them no matter what happens into
[02:48:44.880 --> 02:48:50.720]  the future as long as we never give up here she is it's also what happens when you listen to the
[02:48:50.720 --> 02:49:00.880]  radio host alex jones who claims that 9 11 and the oklahoma city bombings were inside jobs
[02:49:00.880 --> 02:49:08.000]  i don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be
[02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:13.200]  to say things like that the russians ran an extensive information war
[02:49:14.080 --> 02:49:22.320]  campaign against my campaign to influence voters in the election and then they began to weaponize
[02:49:22.320 --> 02:49:32.640]  them and they began to have some of their allies within the uh internet world like info wars take
[02:49:32.640 --> 02:49:39.760]  out pieces and began to say the most outrageous outlandish absurd lies you can imagine but trump
[02:49:39.760 --> 02:49:46.960]  doesn't challenge these lies he actually went on jones's show and said your reputation is amazing
[02:49:46.960 --> 02:49:56.800]  i will not let you down waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the
[02:49:56.800 --> 02:50:06.320]  front lines of the info war all right folks now the story is up on info wars dot com
[02:50:06.320 --> 02:50:17.120]  hillary clinton obsessed with alex jones in new book and we have new attacks here that i'm very
[02:50:17.120 --> 02:50:26.400]  very proud of from her book what happened well america rejected you you know it's like taking
[02:50:26.400 --> 02:50:32.880]  a drink of milk and you realize it's rotten we spit you out of our mouths you were beyond
[02:50:32.880 --> 02:50:39.200]  luke warm you were like rancid poisonous satanic
[02:50:42.720 --> 02:50:50.640]  droppings you happened and nothing can put Humpty Dumpty back together again
[02:50:52.400 --> 02:51:00.400]  so here's a clip from her new book what happened attacking yours truly here's the first clip
[02:51:00.400 --> 02:51:07.520]  as hard as the politics of guns are and is divided as the country feels we've got to do better
[02:51:08.560 --> 02:51:15.840]  the nra can spend all at once donald trump can pal around with alex jones the conspiracy theorist
[02:51:15.840 --> 02:51:24.400]  who has called the sandy hook massacre a hoax what a despicable lie they're on the wrong side of
[02:51:24.400 --> 02:51:32.480]  justice history basic human decency and it's because of the sandy hook parents the mothers
[02:51:32.480 --> 02:51:39.600]  of the movement gabby and mark and so many other incredibly brave survivors and family members
[02:51:40.240 --> 02:51:48.160]  that i know in my heart that one day we will stem the tide and save lives okay let's stop right there
[02:51:48.160 --> 02:51:54.880]  i have seen them with these talking points pin everything in the campaign and sense them
[02:51:54.880 --> 02:51:59.440]  that i basically committed the mass shooting at sandy hook i mean that's what it's turned into
[02:52:01.680 --> 02:52:05.120]  my listeners didn't buy the official story because they saw the fake babies and the
[02:52:05.120 --> 02:52:09.440]  incubators and the stage stuff to get us in the iraq war and they saw hillary fund the
[02:52:09.440 --> 02:52:16.080]  arab spring and they saw all the other things they've done so people questioned it because
[02:52:16.080 --> 02:52:20.480]  bloomberg got caught in emails the day before saying a big event's about to happen get ready
[02:52:20.480 --> 02:52:27.040]  we're going after the guns tomorrow but i don't know if sandy hook happened or didn't in fact i
[02:52:27.040 --> 02:52:31.040]  know mass shootings do happen i'm not going to sit there and make a call i can't prove let's say it
[02:52:31.040 --> 02:52:38.560]  happened mass shootings happen but what i know is they blame gun owners for adam lanza and the
[02:52:38.560 --> 02:52:43.840]  legal gun he had and then jp morgan owned the house and bulldozed it the next week and they
[02:52:43.840 --> 02:52:48.560]  bulldozed the school and all this and then they said gun owners were to blame if somebody runs
[02:52:48.560 --> 02:52:57.920]  over a crowd of people on islamicist islams to blame not ford or chevy or dodge or toyota or nissan
[02:53:01.600 --> 02:53:10.080]  or whatever the company is ferrari so i'm sick of hearing some weird whacked out white supremacist
[02:53:10.080 --> 02:53:16.800]  ran over a woman we later learned out of a heart attack or whatever poor lady and then all whites
[02:53:16.800 --> 02:53:22.000]  are to blame but then when you got video all over the world the black people looting you know all
[02:53:22.000 --> 02:53:26.560]  over florida all over the caribbean oh don't show that footage of your races and i'm not against black
[02:53:26.560 --> 02:53:30.400]  people but i don't blame all black people because you got a bunch of black people out looting but
[02:53:30.400 --> 02:53:37.840]  don't blame white people when somebody else does something so there's that clip blaming all gun owners
[02:53:37.840 --> 02:53:42.960]  and then misrepresenting when i've said it's crazy here's another clip what happened
[02:53:44.640 --> 02:53:51.680]  from her ridiculous book of fiction from hillary clinton here's the next clip then in early december
[02:53:51.680 --> 02:53:59.920]  a 28 year old man from north carolina drove to washington dc with a colt ar-15 assault rifle
[02:53:59.920 --> 02:54:08.160]  a 38 caliber colt revolver and a knife he had read on the internet that a popular local
[02:54:08.160 --> 02:54:15.840]  washington pizzeria was secretly hosting a child sex abuse ring run by john pedesta and me
[02:54:17.120 --> 02:54:22.720]  this particularly disgusting fake news got its start with an innocuous email released
[02:54:22.720 --> 02:54:29.440]  by wiki leaks about john going out for pizza it was quickly refracted through the dark corners
[02:54:29.440 --> 02:54:37.200]  of the internet and emerged as a blood curdling conspiracy theory alex jones the right wing
[02:54:37.200 --> 02:54:44.640]  talk show host effusively praised by trump who claims that 9 11 was an inside job and the sandy
[02:54:44.640 --> 02:54:51.840]  hook massacre was a hoax recorded a youtube video about quote all the children hillary clinton has
[02:54:51.840 --> 02:54:59.680]  personally murdered and chopped up and raped unquote soon that young man from north carolina was in
[02:54:59.680 --> 02:55:08.480]  his car i said i'm not going to listen to more of this that clip is directly what they played on
[02:55:08.480 --> 02:55:15.440]  fox news with meghan kelly where i said i don't know if the pizzeria stuff's true and that was the
[02:55:15.440 --> 02:55:19.680]  media diverting onto the pizza place when it was pizza code words in the pedestrian emails in new
[02:55:19.680 --> 02:55:23.120]  york about we're going to have the cheese pizza we're going to have the kids and the hot tubs it
[02:55:23.120 --> 02:55:28.160]  was a cnn new york times and others that diverted off into the pizzeria and then said we made those
[02:55:28.160 --> 02:55:33.440]  claims about the pizzeria you understand and then we clarified they called it a retraction
[02:55:34.480 --> 02:55:41.120]  so that's their fake news dis info op but no people all around you are being convicted of
[02:55:41.120 --> 02:55:46.080]  sex crimes like weiner your your husband's in dozens and dozens of flights on the sex plane
[02:55:46.080 --> 02:55:51.280]  lelita express with kidnapped little girls jerry eppstein uh your top people in your foundation
[02:55:51.280 --> 02:55:56.800]  get caught shipping little kids out of Haiti for sale and then change their names and cover it up
[02:55:56.800 --> 02:56:04.080]  the first people you represented in legal firms were child rapist hillary so you build this straw man
[02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:10.160]  that we sat there and made all this up and sat there and did all of this
[02:56:10.160 --> 02:56:16.080]  this and then some guy that said actor shows up none of the witnesses say they saw a gun
[02:56:16.080 --> 02:56:21.040]  fired or even heard it then you say he came because of me and shot into the wall so that
[02:56:21.040 --> 02:56:26.720]  now all pedophiles now any investigation of the catholic church any of it it doesn't exist
[02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:36.000]  even though senator menendez is in court right now you're not going to be able to run on forever
[02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:41.680]  lady the truth is your publications said the pizzeria your publications diverted everyone
[02:56:41.680 --> 02:56:47.440]  onto that instead of all the real emails to cover what really happened and what really unfolded and
[02:56:47.440 --> 02:56:56.160]  you failed again oh the good news is her book is 50 off out of the gate she's a total failure
[02:56:56.160 --> 02:57:03.920]  no one's buying her lies it's already literally 50 off out of the gates and that's in england
[02:57:03.920 --> 02:57:10.960]  here's another clip from hillary from her stupid book the simplest part is traditional state run
[02:57:10.960 --> 02:57:19.200]  media in this case russian networks such as rt and sputnik they use their global reach to push
[02:57:19.200 --> 02:57:25.840]  kremlin talking points over the airwaves and social media including malicious headlines like
[02:57:25.840 --> 02:57:33.920]  clinton and isis funded by same money sputnik frequently use the same twitter hashtag as trump
[02:57:34.720 --> 02:57:41.760]  hashtag crooked hillary it's hard to know exactly how wide of a reach rt has hit pause
[02:57:41.760 --> 02:57:47.760]  a dip pause anytime a hashtag see she thinks you're so dumb her readers are so dumb when there's a
[02:57:47.760 --> 02:57:54.640]  top hashtag for super bowl or crooked hillary whatever's up in the top 10 everyone hashtags
[02:57:54.640 --> 02:58:03.920]  that so that it's in the reference feed of whatever's hot but because a russian newspaper was doing
[02:58:03.920 --> 02:58:09.520]  stories about hillary and piling on to the huge campaign and the traffic that's the proof that
[02:58:09.520 --> 02:58:16.240]  they use the same hashtag that's like if you've got a pizza place and you put in the in the phone
[02:58:16.240 --> 02:58:22.640]  book pizza like strange another pizza place that the name pizza you see how dumb she thinks you are
[02:58:22.640 --> 02:58:26.320]  we're going to come back with her latest attacks out of the book on yours truly because she's
[02:58:26.320 --> 02:58:32.640]  desperate and pathetic and we just passed the one-year anniversary of her collapse
[02:58:32.640 --> 02:58:39.760]  onto her evil fat face on the 9 11 memorial visit gcmi because there is a god fourth hour paul
[02:58:39.760 --> 02:58:47.520]  Watson coming up more than two years ago info wars first told you about our research into what has
[02:58:47.520 --> 02:58:52.320]  been called the iodine conspiracy i've told you about how scientists have known for decades that
[02:58:52.320 --> 02:58:58.240]  iodine deficiencies can devastate iq and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of
[02:58:58.240 --> 02:59:03.200]  the food and adding fluoride the bad member of the halogen family into the water they took the
[02:59:03.200 --> 02:59:08.880]  good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in and when the hukushima crisis worsened as it still
[02:59:08.880 --> 02:59:15.120]  is worsening today i was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family now in 2016
[02:59:15.120 --> 02:59:20.720]  even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut which
[02:59:20.720 --> 02:59:26.560]  many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine you can pull
[02:59:26.560 --> 02:59:31.520]  these studies up for yourself this is the real deal folks and the truth is that iodine is essential
[02:59:31.520 --> 02:59:37.920]  in my view to any optimum health regimen stock up on survival shield x2 today at info wars life
[02:59:37.920 --> 02:59:47.600]  dot com or by calling eight eight eight two five three three one three nine you're listening to the alex
[02:59:47.600 --> 02:59:57.040]  jones show we're getting a new effort to fix as much of our immigration system as i can on my own
[02:59:57.040 --> 03:00:02.880]  i've also directed secretary johnson and attorney general holder got identify additional actions
[03:00:02.880 --> 03:00:09.120]  my administration can take on our own within my existing legal authorities to do what congress
[03:00:09.120 --> 03:00:15.200]  refuses to do and fix as much of our immigration system as we can from the front lines of the
[03:00:15.200 --> 03:00:30.160]  information war it's alex jones we got breaking news i hate to cut into paul watchers time it's
[03:00:30.160 --> 03:00:34.560]  hard to get him to come host the show because he's so busy writing hit articles and in the top 50 on
[03:00:34.560 --> 03:00:40.000]  twitter but laura lumberg in front of hillary about what happened so she's coming in at the
[03:00:40.000 --> 03:00:43.920]  start of the next segment and we're going to get her on and show that video that i'm told just went
[03:00:43.920 --> 03:00:48.320]  on her twitter mike service was just tweeting me she was going to be on earlier but it got delayed
[03:00:48.320 --> 03:00:52.160]  so we're going to have her on tomorrow but the confrontation happened now listen to this next
[03:00:52.160 --> 03:00:58.800]  clip out of what happened how hillary collapsed in her fake book that now is 50 off everywhere 40
[03:00:58.800 --> 03:01:04.400]  percent off on amazon and it's already 30 off on amazon so that's 70 off this is already discounted
[03:01:04.400 --> 03:01:11.280]  what happened no one buys your lies anymore go away don't go away mad just go away lady
[03:01:13.520 --> 03:01:19.120]  she acts like though oh rt is not powerful but once they tell alex what to do and once they
[03:01:19.120 --> 03:01:25.680]  tell breitbart and drudge what to do as if americans aren't smart and hardworking and don't see her as
[03:01:25.680 --> 03:01:33.600]  a crooked swamp dweller just because you and other idiots like maxine waters say the swamp came from
[03:01:33.600 --> 03:01:41.040]  putin or crooked hillary came from putin or it low it came from us dumbass i don't get stuff from
[03:01:41.040 --> 03:01:46.560]  the russians i hardly read russian news nothing against the russians i don't need the russians
[03:01:47.120 --> 03:01:52.800]  to put my pants on in the morning she talks about us like we're a bunch of idiots because that's
[03:01:52.800 --> 03:01:59.840]  what she thinks you are because her constituents are that gosh i'm sick of these people let's play
[03:01:59.840 --> 03:02:08.160]  the club here it is part is traditional state-run media in this case russian networks such as rt
[03:02:08.160 --> 03:02:14.400]  and sputnik they use their global reach to push kremlin talking points over the airways
[03:02:14.960 --> 03:02:20.000]  and social media including i like the talking points like clinton i wrote most of them i don't
[03:02:20.000 --> 03:02:26.720]  want to brag but i wrote them i wrote them i did me use the same twitter tag as trump
[03:02:27.520 --> 03:02:35.840]  hashtag crooked hillary it's hard to know exactly how wide of a reach rt has a daily beast article
[03:02:35.840 --> 03:02:42.560]  reported on claims that it had exaggerated its stats it's probably more than you'd think maybe
[03:02:42.560 --> 03:02:48.080]  hundreds of thousands but not enough that it would have a big impact on an election by itself
[03:02:48.080 --> 03:02:55.200]  good pause again i happen to know rt stats they now have double cnn this has been in global news
[03:02:55.200 --> 03:03:00.400]  double cnn's viewership worldwide because everybody hates cnn rt is on broadcast stations in the uk and
[03:03:00.400 --> 03:03:08.160]  europe it's tens of millions of viewers per hour globally but they've been blocked in the u.s rt
[03:03:08.160 --> 03:03:16.400]  global's big rt america tiny yes maybe a hundred thousand way below cnn rt america is not successful
[03:03:16.400 --> 03:03:22.880]  rt global's huge because cnn created a vacuum so so she's acting like they didn't it's everything
[03:03:22.880 --> 03:03:31.680]  she says is a lie let's continue by itself but when rt propaganda gets picked up and repeated by
[03:03:31.680 --> 03:03:41.280]  american media outlets such as fox news bright bart and alex jones's info wars and posted on facebook
[03:03:41.280 --> 03:03:48.560]  its reach expands dramatically that happened frequently during the campaign trump and his
[03:03:48.560 --> 03:03:54.560]  team also helped amplify russian stories giving them an even bigger megaphone
[03:03:55.440 --> 03:04:00.720]  really show us the proof of the amplification of russian stories
[03:04:02.640 --> 03:04:07.360]  you guys at allister crally events with the with with the leader admitting she's a devil

[03:11:29.920 --> 03:11:35.280]  thing about this and laura laura will get into it with you even more hillary basically turned up an
[03:11:35.280 --> 03:11:40.720]  hour and a half late she was schmoozing with people at the view you literally had disabled people the
[03:11:40.720 --> 03:11:46.800]  elderly melting outside in the boiling hot sun there were ambulances called people were collapsing
[03:11:46.800 --> 03:11:53.120]  of heat exhaustion and dehydration because queen hillary wouldn't even show up on time to see her
[03:11:53.120 --> 03:11:57.360]  own supporters there were tons of people who didn't even get in because they didn't turn up early enough
[03:11:57.360 --> 03:12:04.160]  to get the bracelets to meet meet the goddess so that's the amount of the spite and disregard she
[03:12:04.160 --> 03:12:12.000]  has for her own supporters again underscoring how completely arrogant she is now there's
[03:12:12.000 --> 03:12:15.680]  several videos several confrontations and we're going to laura lumar we're pulling them in right
[03:12:15.680 --> 03:12:20.720]  now they're on news wars dot com prison planet dot com info wars dot com they've been tweeted at

[03:12:32.240 --> 03:12:37.600]  happened you're a trader you're a globalist we rejected you america happened but also uh you
[03:12:37.600 --> 03:12:44.160]  know ask her what happened with ben gazi what happened with the emails well that's exactly what
[03:12:44.160 --> 03:12:49.600]  laura asked her alex and she can tell you about herself but also uh as you see in the video as
[03:12:49.600 --> 03:12:55.040]  she was being basically dragged out by secret service she also cut her foot reportedly and she's
[03:12:55.040 --> 03:13:00.320]  going to talk about that as well she got to confront humor abedin and asked her quote when
[03:13:00.320 --> 03:13:05.040]  are you going to divorce your husband for texting underage girls uh humor wasn't happy with that
[03:13:05.040 --> 03:13:09.200]  question and at that point they really started getting aggressive with her and she was out of
[03:13:09.200 --> 03:13:13.760]  the building uh but it was a really good confrontation again underscoring that this is how
[03:13:13.760 --> 03:13:18.640]  you do this kind of thing i mean she'll tell you she literally had to wait about seven or eight hours
[03:13:18.640 --> 03:13:24.640]  with no water standing up the whole time just to get this confrontation and the media always spends
[03:13:24.640 --> 03:13:29.840]  this that that these people are paid and every time they do it to make fake news real the alchemy
[03:13:30.480 --> 03:13:34.560]  laura lumbers not paid to do this by us but i'm sending her this video so powerful
[03:13:35.120 --> 03:13:41.840]  five thousand dollars for doing this and getting beat up and standing in there for all these hours
[03:13:41.840 --> 03:13:46.320]  five thousand dollars from the war chest we're not rich here but the money we get is spent on
[03:13:46.320 --> 03:13:50.960]  real journalism on taking action and i want to get laura lumar officially doing work with us i
[03:13:50.960 --> 03:13:55.600]  know she does with some other outfits but i'm very very exciting laura lumar let's bring you up before
[03:13:55.600 --> 03:14:01.120]  we play this powerful video again laura lumar laura lumar at laura lumar on twitter go ahead
[03:14:02.480 --> 03:14:07.600]  hi alex thanks for having me how are you fantastic so so tell us what happened describe it for us
[03:14:08.400 --> 03:14:14.000]  oh my god it was brutal so i literally have been waiting outside in 100 degree weather without
[03:14:14.000 --> 03:14:19.200]  water without food for seven hours i woke up at five o'clock in the morning to be there at you
[03:14:19.200 --> 03:14:24.720]  know seven thirty and it was just insane hillary decided to show up an hour late because she wanted
[03:14:24.720 --> 03:14:30.720]  to go on the view and kept everyone waiting people were passing out from heat exhaustion um you know
[03:14:30.720 --> 03:14:34.640]  there were people with prosthetic legs who were forced to stand for hours because they
[03:14:34.640 --> 03:14:41.680]  wouldn't bring disabled people inside to sit down and it was it was honestly the longest i've ever
[03:14:41.680 --> 03:14:47.120]  waited to confront the politician in my life and i've confronted a lot of people so you know i'm
[03:14:47.120 --> 03:14:52.080]  there and i'm recording and they say put your phones away but you know i'm trained to kind of
[03:14:52.080 --> 03:14:58.560]  secretly record i learned a lot about that with my time at project bear talk and as i'm walking up
[03:14:58.560 --> 03:15:03.760]  i see huma in the background and um you know i get hillary at first and i said hillary the
[03:15:03.760 --> 03:15:08.960]  american people would really like to know what happened to your 33 000 emails and then she kind
[03:15:08.960 --> 03:15:12.480]  of giggled and said well you're going to have to read the book and i said well what happened in
[03:15:12.480 --> 03:15:16.720]  vangossi and what happened to the millions of dollars you were supposed to give to uh you know
[03:15:16.720 --> 03:15:22.320]  all those poor people and in haiti and then she um you know i i don't really remember exactly what
[03:15:22.320 --> 03:15:25.520]  she said because it was you know in the heat of the moment and then i said what happened is that's
[03:15:25.520 --> 03:15:30.720]  rich and she said you know you really shouldn't believe everything to hear on like fake news and
[03:15:30.720 --> 03:15:34.960]  at that point you know they had recognized me because the same book handlers were there from
[03:15:34.960 --> 03:15:39.840]  when i confronted chelsea clinton at the same barns noble a couple months ago so he would think
[03:15:39.840 --> 03:15:43.760]  that these people would be smart enough to recognize me since i did the same thing to chelsea
[03:15:43.760 --> 03:15:49.120]  literally like less than two months ago but nobody recognized me and i wasn't even able to get to
[03:15:49.120 --> 03:15:54.000]  huma and i just couldn't help but ask her listen lady like are you going to divorce your husband
[03:15:54.000 --> 03:15:58.800]  for sending dick pics to underage girls and i have the answer here everybody keeps saying do
[03:15:58.800 --> 03:16:05.360]  we sue the tech giants for censoring us yes uh do we form our own companies yes uh do we boycott
[03:16:05.360 --> 03:16:10.800]  them yes do we have whistleblowers inside yes but more importantly we physically go peacefully
[03:16:10.800 --> 03:16:16.400]  everywhere the tech people are the globalists the republican rhinos the globalists the radical
[03:16:16.400 --> 03:16:22.880]  jihadis we go everywhere and confront them with the truth and put it out and what you did is going
[03:16:22.880 --> 03:16:30.000]  super viral uh laura lumar we just want to commend you and salute you barns and noble i tell us this
[03:16:30.000 --> 03:16:34.800]  was barns and noble in new york city i gotta tell you i've been in many 9 11 memorials this is a barns
[03:16:34.800 --> 03:16:38.880]  and noble in new york city and let me just tell you this a lot of people i got detained by secret
[03:16:38.880 --> 03:16:42.400]  service and they tried to humiliate me right they took me out of the building and they said what do
[03:16:42.400 --> 03:16:47.280]  you do and i said i'm a journalist and then they were like you're a journalist and they took my phone
[03:16:47.280 --> 03:16:51.360]  and they were trying to delete the video but i wouldn't and the most interesting thing is they said
[03:16:51.360 --> 03:16:55.520]  are you trying to hurt hillary clinton because they were there because of what martin scrella
[03:16:55.520 --> 03:17:00.480]  had said they said we're here to protect mrs clinton because somebody threatened to cut a piece of her
[03:17:00.480 --> 03:17:04.960]  hair off for five thousand dollars and they were asking me if i was there to like you know cut her
[03:17:04.960 --> 03:17:09.680]  hair sure they were dehumanizing you even though they know full well you're a peaceful activist
[03:17:09.680 --> 03:17:15.200]  they're the ones that love us and kill the police all day they have special libtard secret service
[03:17:15.200 --> 03:17:19.120]  that you know the clinton's only have the very worst around them but good secret service told
[03:17:19.120 --> 03:17:23.680]  us about how she was having convulsions every 45 minutes we put the word out caught her in the
[03:17:23.680 --> 03:17:29.280]  medical tent last year and one week later she fell down didn't she yeah and you know what it's
[03:17:29.280 --> 03:17:32.800]  what's crazy as i asked hillary i was like what happened to your health and then as i'm getting
[03:17:32.800 --> 03:17:37.680]  detained by secret service i said you know i read that book by the secret service officer who was
[03:17:37.680 --> 03:17:41.680]  talking about how she doesn't treat you guys very well and i just want to say even though you're
[03:17:41.680 --> 03:17:46.000]  detaining me i respect what you do and you have a very hard job and i'm not resisting and i'm gonna
[03:17:46.000 --> 03:17:50.960]  totally comply with what you're asking me to know that this is my first amendment right to ask
[03:17:51.680 --> 03:17:56.000]  a politician a question and they said well this isn't the right way to go about it and i said
[03:17:56.000 --> 03:18:00.720]  well what are you supposed to do when you have a politician who refuses to take questions from
[03:18:00.720 --> 03:18:05.120]  the media when they try and go about it and in other ways right so the thing about citizen
[03:18:05.120 --> 03:18:09.840]  journalism is you have to take things into your own hands and you know search out the truth for
[03:18:09.840 --> 03:18:14.800]  yourself because the deep state and the globalist and you know we know the clinton's they're going
[03:18:14.800 --> 03:18:19.600]  to do everything in their power to sure they're bullies and you got to call them on that i want
[03:18:19.600 --> 03:18:23.040]  to go to this video i'm gonna turn things over to paul because i don't want to hog into the hour
[03:18:23.040 --> 03:18:28.640]  he's gracious enough to do here with us paul a prison planet but uh let's go ahead and play
[03:18:28.640 --> 03:18:33.520]  this clip here in a moment but first off i heard you did get roughed up did you cut your foot because

[03:18:41.760 --> 03:18:47.520]  10 hours and i'm very dehydrated i'm shaking and um yeah i think that when they drag me out i must
[03:18:47.520 --> 03:18:51.600]  have like cut my foot on some glass because it feels like i have glass splinters in the bottom
[03:18:51.600 --> 03:18:57.280]  of my toe just to be clear i've been at many 9 11 memorials you think texas is hot in september

[03:19:06.480 --> 03:19:10.560]  oh yeah and i'm from arizona alex so i know what hot is and i'm telling you like the humidity is
[03:19:10.560 --> 03:19:15.920]  way worse than the dry heat so it's been well i've been in arizona when it's 115 it kind of feels cool
[03:19:15.920 --> 03:19:20.640]  it's like it's like real crisp but hot but when you're in new york or houston's just as bad
[03:19:21.200 --> 03:19:25.680]  houston in new york and when it's it's humid it's horrible uh let's go ahead and play this clip i'm
[03:19:25.680 --> 03:19:31.040]  going to turn you and uh paul over to the show here but here is laura lumark confronting umma

[03:20:25.360 --> 03:20:30.400]  describing the video dragging her away let's continue
[03:20:30.400 --> 03:20:36.080]  you're just going to move to the end of the line with your thanks
[03:20:48.640 --> 03:20:52.640]  houma it's so great to see you i have a question for you what are you going to divorce your
[03:20:52.640 --> 03:21:06.720]  husband for texting wow i see paul watson over there laughing um this is just amazing and this
[03:21:06.720 --> 03:21:10.560]  is the stuff that scares them because even in new york they can barely get a crowd of a couple
[03:21:10.560 --> 03:21:15.040]  hundred people i mean you can get a crowd anywhere in the world i can't laura can't bear that she's
[03:21:15.040 --> 03:21:19.520]  got all this secret service all this there's avidine creeping around with her pervert husband
[03:21:19.520 --> 03:21:25.920]  convicted pervert uh and it's all just falling in on him it's all it's all falling apart right
[03:21:25.920 --> 03:21:32.480]  now in front of her and her book is 50 off the day it went on sale a total failure paul
[03:21:33.920 --> 03:21:38.560]  yeah that's in london it's in the article it's it's reduced it's on special offer already
[03:21:38.560 --> 03:21:44.480]  because nobody's interested because she's still on this cashing in on the butthurt winch tour
[03:21:44.480 --> 03:21:49.680]  even her own fundraisers alex have come out and said you know people who gave a bankroll during
[03:21:49.680 --> 03:21:54.960]  the election said please shut the f up they literally said that they said you're hurting
[03:21:54.960 --> 03:22:01.600]  the democratic party get over it take responsibility for how utterly pathetic you were and just go
[03:22:01.600 --> 03:22:07.520]  away that's what everybody's saying to hillary she's so arrogant she will not do it she's still
[03:22:07.520 --> 03:22:12.480]  clinging on to that relevancy even though everybody and isn't that indicative in our
[03:22:12.480 --> 03:22:18.240]  type of all the rest the deep state losers that are just so arrogant they can't believe the whole
[03:22:18.240 --> 03:22:23.760]  world's turning against them they just can't understand that they no longer have complete
[03:22:23.760 --> 03:22:29.520]  control over everything the narrative has changed people don't buy into their crap anymore but they
[03:22:29.520 --> 03:22:33.440]  can't move on they're still living in a world that doesn't exist anymore do you know what king
[03:22:33.440 --> 03:22:38.080]  george the third did when george washington refused kingship and did a treaty with england he said
[03:22:38.080 --> 03:22:44.960]  george washington is the greatest man alive in the world now king george the third had problems
[03:22:44.960 --> 03:22:49.600]  but he at least was honorable enough to say george washington's a better man than me
[03:22:49.600 --> 03:22:55.360]  and is the and is the winner why comparing king george uh paul to somebody like hillary clinton
[03:22:57.200 --> 03:23:01.440]  it's just that sociopathic tendency alex where that they just can't even consider it's like
[03:23:01.440 --> 03:23:08.320]  tony blair with the iraq war like he still thinks he's right you know 14 15 years later with the iraq war
[03:23:08.320 --> 03:23:13.120]  they convinced themselves because they're sociopaths that's what sociopaths are best at doing
[03:23:13.120 --> 03:23:18.560]  and with he believes the lie that's why they can sell you on one yeah and it's like her entire book
[03:23:18.560 --> 03:23:24.320]  what happened well what happened was you screwed over bernie sanders and a ton of his voters didn't
[03:23:24.320 --> 03:23:29.520]  vote for you for that very reason that's a huge part of why you're you lost what happened is you
[03:23:29.520 --> 03:23:35.280]  were in bed with the media it got exposed people were sick of that cronyism that's why you lost
[03:23:35.280 --> 03:23:40.800]  neither of those things are in her book she's a sociopath she won't face up to reality like all of
[03:23:40.800 --> 03:23:45.280]  them that's right laura loomer i'm going to turn you over to paul who i just can't every day there's
[03:23:45.280 --> 03:23:50.640]  so much news i run into when he hosts tuesday i've talked paul into joining um david night once a week
[03:23:50.640 --> 03:23:56.640]  myself once a week as well and oh and shroyer uh but laura i want to salute you thank you for
[03:23:56.640 --> 03:24:01.360]  giving us the big first exclusive on this so uh i know paul's got another guest coming up as well
[03:24:01.360 --> 03:24:07.120]  but uh laura other comments paul you're in charge yeah laura just go ahead with your final comments
[03:24:07.120 --> 03:24:11.360]  i know you're probably eager to get something to drink and have a rest after waiting for seven
[03:24:11.360 --> 03:24:14.960]  eight hours just your final comments what you what was going through your mind when you approached
[03:24:14.960 --> 03:24:19.760]  hillary you were very polite you said oh how are you doing it was a very polite conversation
[03:24:19.760 --> 03:24:25.520]  god forbid you should ask a politician a question right laura yeah i know god forbid and that's why
[03:24:25.520 --> 03:24:29.360]  i was so taken aback by what the secret service said to me is because you know they were trying
[03:24:29.360 --> 03:24:32.960]  to mock me when i said i'm a journalist they said you're a journalist you have any proof of that
[03:24:32.960 --> 03:24:36.960]  and i said yeah look it up and then they looked it up and they said oh we don't have any proof and
[03:24:36.960 --> 03:24:41.360]  i've been investigating the the clinton's for years i mean during my time at project veritas i
[03:24:41.360 --> 03:24:48.640]  did many investigations which resulted in you know a lot of public humiliation and you know
[03:24:48.640 --> 03:24:53.760]  further investigation for the clinton and clinton family so you know just to be humiliated by their
[03:24:53.760 --> 03:24:57.920]  secret service agents and told that i'm not a journalist because you know i decide to use an
[03:24:57.920 --> 03:25:02.240]  iphone instead of you know and i'm not paid millions of dollars a year by some left-wing
[03:25:02.240 --> 03:25:07.040]  mainstream or it's a game they play you've been you've been in veritas you're all over the place
[03:25:07.040 --> 03:25:12.080]  constantly going confronting them about the murder trump play they just play that mind game i just
[03:25:12.080 --> 03:25:16.320]  laugh at that you go yeah we're the new media you're who we're trying to shut down because
[03:25:16.320 --> 03:25:21.600]  we're winners i mean hillary's book constantly talks about me i mean what are they supposed to do
[03:25:21.600 --> 03:25:27.280]  yeah i mean all i want to say is she welcomed this full like just all the way why would you
[03:25:27.280 --> 03:25:30.720]  name your book what happened i mean did she not think people were going to come to her event and
[03:25:30.720 --> 03:25:34.240]  ask her what happened because seriously i mean there's a lot of questions but she didn't answer
[03:25:34.240 --> 03:25:37.760]  during the election that people want answers to now and i'm not going to stop i mean i'm going to
[03:25:37.760 --> 03:25:44.000]  ask these questions so that's all i have to well the big goal Laura is like well the bill clinton's
[03:25:44.000 --> 03:25:48.320]  a rapist thing to cause the chain reaction do you agree with me and paul that that's the key to all
[03:25:48.320 --> 03:25:53.040]  the censorship is to physically get in the streets but not like some antifa thing throwing
[03:25:54.000 --> 03:25:59.680]  urine on people to go out and throw truth on people well look alex i don't know if you remember
[03:25:59.680 --> 03:26:03.360]  but about a month ago when she first announced the name of her book was what happened i actually
[03:26:03.360 --> 03:26:08.000]  messaged paul in advance and said this would be a wonderful infowars contest to have because
[03:26:08.000 --> 03:26:11.360]  you know what you could do is you could say go to her event you know go to these book signing
[03:26:11.360 --> 03:26:16.720]  events and ask her what happened and they would just be scared absolutely shitless because they
[03:26:16.720 --> 03:26:20.640]  would have all these citizen journalists armed with cell phones and you can't take away everyone's
[03:26:20.640 --> 03:26:24.320]  cell phone and they're going to ask her what happened and it would just be a nightmare i mean
[03:26:24.320 --> 03:26:28.960]  you have to put these people on guard and let them know that we're everywhere well looks like it
[03:26:28.960 --> 03:26:34.960]  just happened so there you go hillary clinton's going to be imagined how much she hates because
[03:26:34.960 --> 03:26:40.320]  they have killed a lot of people they do have hit and they kill me if i get killed look at
[03:26:40.320 --> 03:26:46.080]  hillary clinton as the main culprit folks i just want that said she is a known murdering scumbag
[03:26:46.080 --> 03:26:51.600]  and she's got to be stopped sorry paul take over yeah thanks alex yeah i mean and it's this whole
[03:26:51.600 --> 03:26:55.760]  thing that we don't have the right to reply number one you know who cares if you're a journalist or
[03:26:55.760 --> 03:27:01.360]  not you're an american you have a first amendment you asked a question god forbid that's the whole
[03:27:01.360 --> 03:27:05.760]  point right they freak out every time it's like all that's going to happen is that you're going to
[03:27:05.760 --> 03:27:11.280]  ask a question then leave the fact that they freak out every time makes it even worse for them right
[03:27:11.280 --> 03:27:16.960]  no it makes it even worse and the funniest part was they thought i was working in conspiracy
[03:27:16.960 --> 03:27:22.480]  with martin scurelli they were so scared they said they asked me are you on drugs are you are you
[03:27:22.480 --> 03:27:26.880]  here to take a lock of hillary's hair for five thousand dollars and i was laughing because i knew
[03:27:26.880 --> 03:27:32.160]  exactly what they were talking about but they're so paranoid i mean she literally has secret service
[03:27:32.160 --> 03:27:36.400]  trying to protect her hair because they must really honestly think that somebody is trying
[03:27:36.400 --> 03:27:40.720]  to take a lock of her hair i mean i would be more more worried about people with cell phone cameras
[03:27:40.720 --> 03:27:46.000]  trying to expose you for the crook and the liar and the fraud that you are as opposed to somebody
[03:27:46.000 --> 03:27:49.840]  trying to approach you with some scissors and you know sell your hair for five thousand dollars
[03:27:51.280 --> 03:27:56.160]  it's absolutely insane laura you were polite you asked a few questions big deal the fact that they
[03:27:56.160 --> 03:28:00.720]  freaked out about it's made it an even bigger story so that's more fool them isn't it any final
[03:28:00.720 --> 03:28:06.400]  comments laura then i'll let you get off and get a drink of water no i didn't get my book they
[03:28:06.400 --> 03:28:11.200]  wouldn't let me take my signed copy of hillary's book even though i waited for seven hours so if
[03:28:11.200 --> 03:28:16.480]  somebody wants to get me a signed copy i would love you forever i really just want to sign copy of
[03:28:16.480 --> 03:28:23.600]  what happened all right we're going to leave it there laura amazing confrontation the article

[03:28:47.760 --> 03:28:52.480]  during book signing what happened to seth rich because that was one of several questions that
[03:28:52.480 --> 03:28:57.600]  were asked of hillary clinton none of which she answers in her actual book it's just a continuation
[03:28:57.600 --> 03:29:05.520]  of cashing in on butthurt her winchfest tour and again every month or so or even greater in
[03:29:05.520 --> 03:29:11.360]  regularity she starts whining and bitching about info wars and alex jones and it's like we have
[03:29:11.360 --> 03:29:16.560]  the right to reply so this is one way in which we're going to reply after the break though we've
[03:29:16.560 --> 03:29:22.880]  got an amazing guest coming up andrew tate kickboxing champion to talk about the truth about
[03:29:22.880 --> 03:29:27.600]  depression that's coming up after the break we've also got a ton of news coming later in the show
[03:29:27.600 --> 03:29:32.800]  this is the alex jones show live fourth hour andrew tate coming up don't go away
[03:29:38.000 --> 03:29:44.800]  we're on the march the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[03:29:44.800 --> 03:29:56.880]  December 23rd 1776 these are the times that try men's souls the summer soldier and the sunshine
[03:29:56.880 --> 03:30:01.360]  patriot wheel in this crisis shrink from the service of their country but he that stands by
[03:30:01.360 --> 03:30:07.600]  it now deserves the love and thanks of man and woman tyranny like hell is not easily conquered
[03:30:07.600 --> 03:30:12.640]  yet we have this consolation with us that the heart of the conflict the more glorious the triumph
[03:30:12.640 --> 03:30:18.640]  what we obtain too cheap we esteem too lightly it is dearness only that gives everything its value
[03:30:18.640 --> 03:30:23.920]  heaven knows how to put a proper price on its goods and it would be strange indeed if so
[03:30:23.920 --> 03:30:29.440]  celestial an article as freedom should not be highly rated britain with an army to enforce her
[03:30:29.440 --> 03:30:35.680]  tyranny has declared that she has a right not only to tax but to bind us in all cases whatsoever
[03:30:35.680 --> 03:30:40.960]  and if being bound in that matter is not slavery then there is no such thing as slavery upon earth
[03:30:40.960 --> 03:30:48.000]  even the expression is impious for so unlimited a power can only belong to god thomas pain the
[03:30:48.000 --> 03:30:53.200]  american crisis it's not just our water we need to filter it's not just our food that needs to be
[03:30:53.200 --> 03:30:58.320]  cleaned it's the air we're breathing especially for our children the artificial particulates
[03:30:58.320 --> 03:31:04.240]  the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems the same team based right here
[03:31:04.240 --> 03:31:09.280]  in america that brought you the alexa pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have

[03:31:20.080 --> 03:31:25.280]  masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid

[03:31:31.040 --> 03:31:35.360]  steal at three hundred four hundred five hundred dollars one of these systems can keep eight hundred
[03:31:35.360 --> 03:31:39.600]  square feet incredibly clean this is a system i'm personally putting in throughout my house
[03:31:39.600 --> 03:31:45.440]  replacing older more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job find out why this system is so
[03:31:45.440 --> 03:31:52.560]  revolutionary today and then fullwarstore.com as most of you already know i am a voracious
[03:31:52.560 --> 03:31:58.080]  consumer of news and information and in the last four or five years doing more and more research
[03:31:58.080 --> 03:32:03.680]  i came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient
[03:32:03.680 --> 03:32:09.920]  ancestors in many cases had much better nutrition than we do today and our ancient ancestors sought
[03:32:09.920 --> 03:32:15.920]  out the bones of the animals that they were hunting killing and then processing and so i set out to
[03:32:15.920 --> 03:32:23.040]  develop caveman but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken but seven other superfood
[03:32:23.040 --> 03:32:29.920]  ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time info wars isn't just

[03:32:56.320 --> 03:33:02.240]  to the alex joneshow and now your host paul joseph Watson
[03:33:06.240 --> 03:33:12.000]  we're live it is fourth hour of the alex joneshow gonna have a great guest on here in a minute andrew
[03:33:12.000 --> 03:33:17.520]  tate to talk about the truth about depression a subject that certainly gets a lot of people very
[03:33:17.520 --> 03:33:22.880]  riled up on twitter because they don't want their orthodoxy to be questioned well that's what we're
[03:33:22.880 --> 03:33:28.240]  all about here so we're going to have a rational civilized discussion about it i'm going to go
[03:33:28.240 --> 03:33:32.720]  to andrew in a second but let's go back to this hillary clinton thing because let's not forget that
[03:33:32.720 --> 03:33:40.240]  hillary endorsed she literally endorsed a website called very it back what was it last week which
[03:33:40.240 --> 03:33:46.480]  literally means to conceal oh but this is the bastion of independent truth it's it's for the 68
[03:33:46.480 --> 03:33:52.000]  million or whoever they said it was it's not a complete echo chamber for everyone who agrees on
[03:33:52.000 --> 03:33:58.640]  and believes the same thing anyway is it no and when someone actually challenged this claim on verit
[03:33:59.200 --> 03:34:04.080]  the beacon of truth for everything can't be questioned because they they're now actually
[03:34:04.080 --> 03:34:09.440]  deleting comments i think it was a comment by tim pool who is a youtuber and journalist who said
[03:34:10.000 --> 03:34:14.320]  because they claim that there was more right wing terrorism across the world uh than uh
[03:34:15.120 --> 03:34:19.760]  islamic terrorism of course he corrected that and said actually that's completely false
[03:34:19.760 --> 03:34:27.280]  they deleted the comment so don't try and post any truth on verit otherwise it will be deleted
[03:34:27.280 --> 03:34:33.440]  in a hurry oh but that's the bastion of credibility for everybody who already agrees with and believes
[03:34:33.440 --> 03:34:39.280]  the same thing as each other anyway and that's hillary clinton's new way of fighting trumpism yeah
[03:34:39.280 --> 03:34:45.280]  good luck with that we have an article here of course we had the big 9 11 anniversary yesterday
[03:34:45.280 --> 03:34:51.440]  google's 9 11 tribute is pathetic and look how they honored a terror sympathizer so of course
[03:34:51.440 --> 03:34:57.760]  there was the tribute to 9 11 anniversary yesterday google had a pathetic black ribbon on the front
[03:34:57.760 --> 03:35:04.000]  page of their website of course normally to virtue signal they they go all out when it's the anniversary
[03:35:04.000 --> 03:35:10.560]  of anything but when it came to 9 11 they made the least effort possible the article says every
[03:35:10.560 --> 03:35:15.200]  time there's virtue to be signaled they pull out all the stops google is bands have pissed off millions
[03:35:15.200 --> 03:35:21.120]  with their practically non-existent acknowledgement of the events that occurred on september 11 2001
[03:35:22.160 --> 03:35:26.720]  so if you took a look at the google homepage yesterday it was just a black ribbon a simple
[03:35:26.720 --> 03:35:32.000]  small black ribbon at the bottom of the screen not an image of the twin towers the police and
[03:35:32.000 --> 03:35:38.160]  firefighters who saved countless lives that day or even the american flag god forbid we could have
[03:35:38.160 --> 03:35:44.560]  the american flag in fact they honored a Maoist asama bin laden supporter more than they did
[03:35:44.560 --> 03:35:49.840]  the actual heroes of 9 11 that is google for you but we're going to go to our guest now because we
[03:35:49.840 --> 03:35:57.200]  have him online he is three-time isk a kickboxing world champion son of chess master emory tate he
[03:35:57.200 --> 03:36:05.120]  is andrew tate at cobra tate on twitter and he started a triggering of immense proportions amongst
[03:36:05.120 --> 03:36:11.440]  verified liberals on twitter of the past few days when he tweeted this is the tweet depression
[03:36:11.440 --> 03:36:17.600]  isn't real you feel sad you move on you will always be depressed if your life is depressing
[03:36:17.600 --> 03:36:22.080]  changed it changed it and of course the response to that when i said i was going to have him on
[03:36:22.080 --> 03:36:27.600]  the show today this is one example someone tweeted at me an unqualified idiot interviews
[03:36:27.600 --> 03:36:34.640]  another unqualified idiot amazing stuff they will bond well well apologies but noted doctor
[03:36:34.640 --> 03:36:40.800]  and mental health expert jk rolling was unavailable for interview so i'm talking with andrew tate
[03:36:40.800 --> 03:36:46.240]  and that's what really gets to me this idea that oh you you have to be an expert to talk about anything
[03:36:46.240 --> 03:36:51.200]  you have to be an expert a medical doctor a psychiatrist to talk about depression oh but
[03:36:51.200 --> 03:36:57.200]  by the way if you write children's books about wizards like jk rolling does you're an anointed
[03:36:57.200 --> 03:37:02.880]  expert on absolutely everything and you're the bastion of credibility no we're going to talk
[03:37:02.880 --> 03:37:08.720]  about it even if it triggers you so let's do it andrew welcome to the show thank you very much
[03:37:08.720 --> 03:37:14.080]  and you made a fantastic point with that argument of authority that you know you must be qualified
[03:37:14.080 --> 03:37:18.480]  to have an opinion on something if that was the case i think every single person who's ever voted
[03:37:18.480 --> 03:37:22.240]  would need a doctorate in political science and of course that's absolutely not the case you're
[03:37:22.240 --> 03:37:27.600]  allowed to have an informed opinion with or without a doctorate and as you said most of the verified
[03:37:27.600 --> 03:37:33.280]  liberals who replied to me were absolutely qualified and nothing so it's ridiculous and even say
[03:37:34.000 --> 03:37:37.600]  well it's like saying that women shouldn't be allowed to vote because they're not informed
[03:37:37.600 --> 03:37:43.760]  enough it's just not an argument like jk rolling's a psychiatrist expert no we're going to have an
[03:37:43.760 --> 03:37:48.960]  opinion on it you know deal with it but anyway let's get into it right anti-depressant usage
[03:37:48.960 --> 03:37:56.720]  in america increased 400 percent in the last two decades depression never been higher in america
[03:37:56.720 --> 03:38:03.200]  amongst teenagers and young adults depression has increased 37 percent since 2005 you know correlation
[03:38:03.200 --> 03:38:10.400]  is not causation but i mean andrew whatever we're doing doesn't seem to be working right well i think
[03:38:10.960 --> 03:38:16.640]  this whole epidemic about depression is basically a misunderstanding of what depression is people
[03:38:16.640 --> 03:38:21.200]  are talking about depression like it's this big external monster like it's this condition you're
[03:38:21.200 --> 03:38:25.840]  going to catch regardless like the common cold and it's something that can't be avoided regardless
[03:38:25.840 --> 03:38:30.240]  of how good your life is and how perfect your life is is going to strike out of nowhere and you
[03:38:30.240 --> 03:38:36.000]  have zero self-control and zero ability to fight against it and when people believe this rhetoric
[03:38:36.000 --> 03:38:40.880]  when people like jk rolling and these celebrities think that they're destroying the stigmas they
[03:38:40.880 --> 03:38:45.680]  were saying i was propagating a stigma all they're doing is is telling people you're helpless to
[03:38:45.680 --> 03:38:50.560]  control your own mind you're helpless to to defend yourself against any kind of negative
[03:38:50.560 --> 03:38:56.400]  thought and the only answer is to completely circum and surrender and take these pills i do
[03:38:56.400 --> 03:39:00.560]  not believe depression is the monster people are saying it is i believe it's a situational
[03:39:01.520 --> 03:39:05.920]  phenomenon if you're in a situation you're unhappy with if you're in depressing surroundings
[03:39:05.920 --> 03:39:11.440]  you're going to feel depressed if you decide to be proactive and get healthy and build a business
[03:39:11.440 --> 03:39:14.720]  and do good things with your life you're going to be proud of yourself and you're going to be happy
[03:39:14.720 --> 03:39:20.320]  i think this is fairly obvious um and a lot of the reason that these young people are suffering
[03:39:20.320 --> 03:39:26.800]  from depression is because they're lazy or they're dissatisfied with their life and instead of thinking
[03:39:26.800 --> 03:39:31.360]  oh i need to do something about this they built they buy into the propaganda which is
[03:39:31.360 --> 03:39:36.320]  being splurged out by people like jk rolling and they think the only answer is to take pills because
[03:39:36.320 --> 03:39:40.240]  depression is a horrible monster that struck them out of nowhere and that's absolutely false it's
[03:39:40.240 --> 03:39:45.520]  not true now to be clear andrew when we talk about depression and we are talking about the
[03:39:45.520 --> 03:39:53.840]  majority of cases we're not denying that traumatic events the grief for example ptsd for soldiers
[03:39:53.840 --> 03:39:59.120]  who fight in wars you know losing the loved one or whatever specific traumatic events we're not
[03:39:59.120 --> 03:40:05.440]  denying that those things can cause even uh long-term depression right we're talking about something
[03:40:05.440 --> 03:40:12.320]  that's related to bad lifestyle choices not individual traumatic events absolutely it's
[03:40:12.320 --> 03:40:17.280]  perfectly normal for a human being to feel sad or depressed or upset about something or upset
[03:40:17.280 --> 03:40:22.560]  about a situation i'm not saying that when i said depression wasn't real i was discussing people's
[03:40:22.560 --> 03:40:27.120]  attitude towards depression because people's attitude towards depression is i've caught depression
[03:40:27.120 --> 03:40:32.080]  it's like a bowler you know i was going through my life and everything was fine and i love everything
[03:40:32.080 --> 03:40:37.520]  but i caught depression and now it's impossible for me to be happy and that is absolutely not true
[03:40:37.520 --> 03:40:41.840]  everyone has been sad everyone has felt depressed but you have two kinds of people you have people
[03:40:41.840 --> 03:40:46.640]  who accept it's part of being human accept it's part of life and push forward and you have people
[03:40:46.640 --> 03:40:51.360]  who succumb to it completely and decided nothing they can do about it and the whole world should
[03:40:51.360 --> 03:40:56.000]  feel sorry for them and when i pointed this out to people people got extremely violent with their
[03:40:56.000 --> 03:41:00.800]  defense and that's purely because the truth often upsets people it doesn't favor it doesn't favor
[03:41:00.800 --> 03:41:05.840]  people who like to have excuses for their life and that's why they were so desperate to defend it
[03:41:05.840 --> 03:41:10.320]  if depression is such a horrible monster and i'm saying there's a way around it there's a way you
[03:41:10.320 --> 03:41:15.040]  can feel better the fact that they'll come on twitter and wish my death for trying to tell them
[03:41:15.040 --> 03:41:20.000]  they can feel better shows just how desperate they are to have this excuse for their life and their
[03:41:20.000 --> 03:41:24.560]  life choices depression is absolutely situational and you have a choice if you're going to succumb
[03:41:24.560 --> 03:41:29.760]  to depression or not it's as simple as that which is why it's kind of ironic where you get accused
[03:41:29.760 --> 03:41:35.440]  of being harmful by jk rolling for for committing this blasphemy and that's basically what it is at
[03:41:35.440 --> 03:41:40.400]  this point these people are more militant than vegans when you question veganism and that's
[03:41:40.400 --> 03:41:45.760]  quite a high bar but the irony behind it is they're the ones telling people there's nothing you can
[03:41:45.760 --> 03:41:53.040]  do about it succumb to it take pills yet depression and suicides just keep on increasing so if anything
[03:41:53.040 --> 03:41:57.760]  they're the ones who are harmful to young generation especially telling them that they can't do
[03:41:57.760 --> 03:42:02.400]  anything about it but let me let me throw this one at you andrew if we accept that the majority
[03:42:02.400 --> 03:42:07.280]  of cases of depression which of course both people don't but that's our position on it i did a video
[03:42:07.280 --> 03:42:12.800]  on this a few months ago if but if we accept that a lot of it is related to bad lifestyle choices
[03:42:12.800 --> 03:42:18.080]  how do we explain people who have had success who have accomplished things i'm talking about people
[03:42:18.080 --> 03:42:22.400]  like buzz older in historical figures like you know winston church he'll complain about having
[03:42:22.400 --> 03:42:29.040]  depression even abraham lincoln you have a ton of sports stars successful actors actresses
[03:42:29.040 --> 03:42:35.600]  that achieve great success but then go on to be depressed anyway how do we explain that if we're
[03:42:35.600 --> 03:42:40.880]  saying that depression is about people not achieving life goals and making bad choices well i think
[03:42:40.880 --> 03:42:45.520]  depression is absolutely reactionary to your surroundings so you can be successful and still
[03:42:45.520 --> 03:42:50.000]  be unhappy with certain elements of your life which can still lead you down a path of depression
[03:42:50.000 --> 03:42:54.240]  but it's very interesting you mentioned winston churchill for example he said he was depressed
[03:42:54.240 --> 03:43:00.320]  yet still functioned still led the country in a war and was successful he didn't do what a lot of
[03:43:00.320 --> 03:43:04.000]  these young people nowadays are doing when they say they're depressed and just refuse to work pretend
[03:43:04.000 --> 03:43:08.560]  they can't get out of bed pretend it's absolutely impossible for them to go to the gym while he
[03:43:08.560 --> 03:43:13.280]  managed to achieve amazing things whilst citing he had depression than others and i think one of the
[03:43:13.280 --> 03:43:19.920]  main reasons why especially nowadays in the modern world these societies these celebrities succumb
[03:43:19.920 --> 03:43:25.360]  to depression it's because they believe the stigma they believe the stigma that people are saying i'm
[03:43:25.360 --> 03:43:30.240]  propagating is not a harmful stigma the stigma that is being propagated by people like jk rolling
[03:43:30.240 --> 03:43:35.920]  is the harmful stigma the idea that there is this unbeatable untreatable crazy monster that will
[03:43:35.920 --> 03:43:41.360]  enter your life and destroy you if you believe that you are going to lose if you externalize
[03:43:41.360 --> 03:43:46.960]  any problem in the world you're going to lose if you're an alcoholic and you want to say i have
[03:43:46.960 --> 03:43:51.520]  alcoholism you're in a losing fight if you believe that this is something that you can't
[03:43:51.520 --> 03:43:56.960]  help and it's going to destroy your life while you continue to get up that's right or buy alcohol
[03:43:56.960 --> 03:44:02.080]  drink alcohol and come home and do it on repeat and you want to pretend it's nothing to do with you
[03:44:02.080 --> 03:44:06.400]  so it's a white flag alex jones here andretate i'm having my lunch watching you and paul i just
[03:44:06.400 --> 03:44:10.320]  got to invite you on my main show because i was already aware of your work it's amazing hearing
[03:44:10.320 --> 03:44:16.560]  you speak uh with paul it's so rational and real there's a spectrum a responsibility in life if
[03:44:16.560 --> 03:44:21.120]  you're not doing the right thing you're going to feel depressed so that's a motivation for me when
[03:44:21.120 --> 03:44:25.760]  i'm not doing enough and not executing the way i know then i'll get a little bit bummed out but
[03:44:25.760 --> 03:44:31.360]  that is something to ignite the fury in me to have victory but beyond that if you drink a bottle of
[03:44:31.360 --> 03:44:37.200]  whiskey you got a huge headache from inflammation that causes depression it goes away once you're
[03:44:37.200 --> 03:44:41.680]  hydrated if you got heat stroke it feels like you're depressed if i get sunburned or height
[03:44:41.680 --> 03:44:45.840]  20 miles and don't drink enough water and get dehydrated i feel depressed till i drink enough
[03:44:45.840 --> 03:44:50.560]  electrolyte so there's a lot of things in here but all the studies show forest bathing getting
[03:44:50.560 --> 03:44:56.560]  outside that empowers us only watching tv staying indoors not getting enough sunlight in our eyes
[03:44:56.560 --> 03:45:02.640]  that causes depression so we ask why is it all getting worse this indoor sedentary lifestyle
[03:45:02.640 --> 03:45:09.600]  is the main trigger then the drugs are admittedly more dangerous uh than than anything out there and
[03:45:09.600 --> 03:45:16.080]  so there's a lot of factors and big pharma has these people like jk rollings who has pr folks tweeting
[03:45:16.080 --> 03:45:21.280]  for that's not jk rollings knowing that they're trying to push people into desperateness just
[03:45:21.280 --> 03:45:27.040]  like earlier this year the facebook documents got leaked by their own executives who had a soul
[03:45:27.040 --> 03:45:33.280]  saying we want to make our users depressed alone controlled we want to isolate them with bots that
[03:45:33.280 --> 03:45:39.120]  aren't real friends i just had to pop in with that you guys are awesome thank you and i completely
[03:45:39.120 --> 03:45:43.280]  completely agree with you i mean the number one way you stop anybody being concerned with the
[03:45:43.280 --> 03:45:48.720]  real issues of this of this world the real issues that we discuss on this show is to make them so
[03:45:48.720 --> 03:45:52.560]  concerned and caught up in the fact that someone said a bad word to them once that they're now
[03:45:52.560 --> 03:45:56.240]  depressed because of internet bullying i've just been internet bullied for three days straight and
[03:45:56.240 --> 03:46:00.480]  i can guarantee you i'm zero percent depressed so that's it in fact you're empowered what doesn't
[03:46:00.480 --> 03:46:06.800]  kill you makes you stronger they're turning them into permanent basket case victims absolutely
[03:46:06.800 --> 03:46:10.720]  it's crazy you know the thing about it especially when you're talking about the antidepressants
[03:46:10.720 --> 03:46:15.760]  uh someone said to me someone tweeted at me like what about robin williams and and i did some very
[03:46:15.760 --> 03:46:20.480]  10 second research i saw that robin williams saw a psychiatrist for 12 years before he eventually
[03:46:20.480 --> 03:46:25.360]  committed suicide and my understanding is as follows if he would have walked into that psychiatrist
[03:46:25.360 --> 03:46:30.720]  office and said i'm depressed and the psychiatrist said my friend you're a millionaire you're famous
[03:46:30.720 --> 03:46:33.760]  you don't even have to grow old gracefully you can have 19 year old girlfriends the rest of your
[03:46:33.760 --> 03:46:38.560]  life the people in here have real problems stop embarrassing yourself get out of here to this day
[03:46:38.560 --> 03:46:44.880]  you'd still be alive but instead the therapist that's the point that's the point andrew i mean
[03:46:44.880 --> 03:46:49.760]  it's not as if we've pulled this out of thin air okay it's called stoicism it's a branch
[03:46:49.760 --> 03:46:55.280]  of philosophy this is a real you know movement of thought we haven't just made it up and started
[03:46:55.280 --> 03:47:00.800]  making youtube videos about it this exists as a branch of philosophy and as a way of treating
[03:47:00.800 --> 03:47:05.040]  depression i want to ask you andrew though you know we talked about the stigma so what extent
[03:47:05.040 --> 03:47:10.560]  is society and culture to blame for fetishizing depression because now we're told of course that
[03:47:10.560 --> 03:47:15.520]  it's normal to be emotionally incontinent you have people on television constantly breaking
[03:47:15.520 --> 03:47:20.880]  down in tears that's basically the foundation of reality television you know youtube is full of
[03:47:20.880 --> 03:47:26.400]  these privileged whiny millennial brats talking about how depressed they are for views how much
[03:47:26.400 --> 03:47:33.040]  has depression become a kind of virtue signaling for narcissists who just want attention narcissists
[03:47:33.040 --> 03:47:38.240]  is completely the right word because the reality of earth and the reality of life is that everybody
[03:47:38.240 --> 03:47:43.680]  is trying to be to a degree individual everyone is it doesn't matter if you're chasing money so
[03:47:43.680 --> 03:47:46.320]  you can have the car other people can't have doesn't matter if you're a kickboxer doesn't
[03:47:46.320 --> 03:47:50.960]  matter if you're a journalist it doesn't matter what you do if you have a healthy normal human
[03:47:50.960 --> 03:47:55.360]  mindset you're going to want to do something to differentiate yourself and the easiest cop out
[03:47:55.360 --> 03:48:00.720]  the easiest cop out to be different is to wake up and for no reason say i have bipolar
[03:48:00.720 --> 03:48:06.400]  i have adhd i have depression i have this i'm special i'm not like everyone else i have this
[03:48:06.400 --> 03:48:10.800]  and this is just an absolute cop out on a desperate bid for individuality since i tweeted
[03:48:10.800 --> 03:48:15.520]  this i've had tens of thousands of people inbox me saying i'm depressed and i have adhd and i have
[03:48:15.520 --> 03:48:20.960]  this and i have that and i'm naming 25 diseases as if they're some kind of amazing unique special
[03:48:20.960 --> 03:48:26.240]  snowflake i'm never going to be possible to understand i understand you're lazy i understand
[03:48:26.240 --> 03:48:30.000]  you're incapable of concentrating on something long enough to give yourself a differentiating
[03:48:30.000 --> 03:48:34.560]  factor in life other than just complaining and that's the world we live in now and we're supposed
[03:48:34.560 --> 03:48:39.200]  to accept this when i meet someone well absolutely i've read the three volume history of the british
[03:48:39.200 --> 03:48:43.760]  peoples uh by church hill an amazing guy and i wouldn't even call it really depression it was
[03:48:43.760 --> 03:48:49.120]  more stoic he was super serious and had such responsibility and was so focused with the
[03:48:49.120 --> 03:48:55.280]  weight and the will he had that he was just could feel the pressure and call that depression but it
[03:48:55.280 --> 03:49:00.880]  was really what the romans called being stoic all the famous really badass serious men were like
[03:49:00.880 --> 03:49:06.160]  super focused and and and and really you could call it depressed because they had such a vision
[03:49:06.160 --> 03:49:10.480]  that they had to commit that will but i wouldn't even call it it just it's the opposite of being
[03:49:10.480 --> 03:49:15.200]  a narcissist it's like being totally connected i'm not i'm not saying depression's a good thing
[03:49:15.200 --> 03:49:21.200]  but that's just some spectrum name they use yeah i think yeah the depression Winston Churchill
[03:49:21.200 --> 03:49:25.600]  suffered from allowed him to win world war two the depression that these millennial brats suffer
[03:49:25.600 --> 03:49:29.360]  from prevent them from working at mcdonald's because they believe they're entitled to millions
[03:49:29.360 --> 03:49:32.880]  for no reason and they want to have a car like everyone else on instagram and they don't see
[03:49:32.880 --> 03:49:36.560]  why they're not instantly happy without any kind of hard work they're completely different things
[03:49:36.560 --> 03:49:41.680]  to compare the two depressions isn't even accurate in my perspective when i see these 19 year olds
[03:49:41.680 --> 03:49:46.080]  with nothing wrong with their life saying they're depressed they genuinely need nothing more than
[03:49:46.080 --> 03:49:49.600]  to man up and be told the truth and that's the absolutely that's the point andrew that's the
[03:49:49.600 --> 03:49:55.920]  word entitlement like no one's entitled to be happy okay you earn happiness through hard work
[03:49:55.920 --> 03:50:02.320]  and good choices your mood can't be independent of the way you live your life the two not only
[03:50:02.320 --> 03:50:07.360]  complement on each other they're completely dependent on each other again it's this whiny
[03:50:07.360 --> 03:50:12.640]  millennial entitled society that just thinks that they can go through life being rewarded without
[03:50:12.640 --> 03:50:17.920]  having to put hard work effort in and not making bad choices and we're not saying that that's all
[03:50:17.920 --> 03:50:23.600]  depression that depression doesn't exist if people lose loved ones if they have ptsd but that is a huge
[03:50:23.600 --> 03:50:27.280]  majority of the cases and when we come up back after the break i just want to talk briefly
[03:50:27.280 --> 03:50:34.880]  about the pharmaceutical aspect to this let's go for it let's skip the rate andrew let's talk
[03:50:34.880 --> 03:50:40.640]  about the pharmaceutical aspect i mentioned the fact depression in america or antidepressant usage
[03:50:40.640 --> 03:50:47.680]  has increased 400 percent over the past two decades it's been re-characterized as a pathological
[03:50:47.680 --> 03:50:53.120]  disease it's a lifelong medical condition that wasn't the case less than 50 years ago it was
[03:50:53.120 --> 03:50:59.200]  seen as temporary unhappiness do you think that there could be any kind of motivation andrew
[03:50:59.200 --> 03:51:05.120]  for massive pharmaceutical companies to turn this into a pathological disease therefore
[03:51:05.120 --> 03:51:10.480]  creating a profit motive do you think that's possible at all it's more than possible and
[03:51:10.480 --> 03:51:14.800]  there's two things i want to say on this and and the first thing which is quite important is that
[03:51:14.800 --> 03:51:20.000]  i believe people like rovin williams the reason they killed themselves is because for 12 years
[03:51:20.000 --> 03:51:25.040]  they sat in a psychiatrist's office talking about bad things every bad thing that's ever happened
[03:51:25.040 --> 03:51:30.880]  to them ever while taking mind-altering drugs daily messing with their brain chemistry it doesn't
[03:51:30.880 --> 03:51:35.600]  matter how mentally strong you are they could put me in that scenario and alter my drug alter my
[03:51:35.600 --> 03:51:40.480]  brain chemistry with these drugs and talk about bad things every day for 12 years i'll feel like
[03:51:40.480 --> 03:51:44.960]  killing myself the same so the reason he eventually did it is not because of depression it's because
[03:51:44.960 --> 03:51:49.680]  of the treatment to depression the treatment to depression this was making these things even worse
[03:51:49.680 --> 03:51:54.000]  you know that's the first point i want to make and the second point i want to make is it's amazing
[03:51:54.000 --> 03:51:59.520]  like you said where depression is more commonplace in these rich countries where people can afford
[03:51:59.520 --> 03:52:05.520]  these kind of you know treatments it's amazing that this disease or this chronic illness seems to
[03:52:05.520 --> 03:52:10.400]  respect country borders it's the only illness i've never ever found that of course if it's not
[03:52:10.400 --> 03:52:15.520]  situational has nothing to do with your situation it should be universal across the human race it
[03:52:15.520 --> 03:52:20.400]  should be exactly the same on a tiny little island in the pacific as it is in america it's nothing to
[03:52:20.400 --> 03:52:24.720]  do with the situation you're living in so i don't know at what point depression is getting to the
[03:52:24.720 --> 03:52:28.640]  getting to the customs office and saying oh no i haven't got a visa i can't go over there
[03:52:28.640 --> 03:52:32.320]  it's ridiculous the reason people are not depressed over there is because no one buys
[03:52:32.320 --> 03:52:38.480]  into this garbage it's not a real thing and it's just an externalization that allows them to absolve
[03:52:38.480 --> 03:52:42.960]  responsibility from their life and you said it perfectly paul you said it absolutely perfectly
[03:52:42.960 --> 03:52:48.320]  if depression was something if your mindset was completely independent to the life you live
[03:52:48.320 --> 03:52:51.920]  why wouldn't we all just catch a case and go to jail you get free room free board you haven't got
[03:52:51.920 --> 03:52:56.800]  a work of job and i should i should be happy in there just the same absolutely not i'd be a depressed
[03:52:56.800 --> 03:53:01.760]  individual because my says my surroundings are depressing so it's in these rich countries exactly
[03:53:01.760 --> 03:53:07.120]  as you said but it's not your opinion andrew or paul with all the major antidepressants have to
[03:53:07.120 --> 03:53:13.040]  put a warning on the label that it causes psychotic breaks suicide and megalomania there's the proof
[03:53:13.040 --> 03:53:17.120]  there and this is what they're saying to treat depression you know i i read something really
[03:53:17.120 --> 03:53:21.840]  interesting with someone tweeted at me saying there's zero evidence for my my my standpoint
[03:53:21.840 --> 03:53:25.920]  lauren mosher was the former chief of schizophrenic research at the national institute of mental
[03:53:25.920 --> 03:53:30.960]  health and he concluded after two years of study that there is no biological condition of depression
[03:53:30.960 --> 03:53:36.240]  because in 100 of cases there's nothing actually wrong with the brain he can't detect anything
[03:53:36.240 --> 03:53:39.680]  wrong with the human brain for these depressed people there's nothing wrong with their brain
[03:53:39.680 --> 03:53:42.800]  there's nothing wrong with their state of mind and their outlook on life and that's something
[03:53:42.800 --> 03:53:47.920]  that needs to be changed with willpower and understanding instead the psychiatrist and
[03:53:47.920 --> 03:53:54.000]  psychologist hypnotize you into deeper mental illness absolutely who wants to sit there and
[03:53:54.000 --> 03:53:57.760]  talk about everything bad that's ever happened to them ever while taking mind-altering drugs
[03:53:57.760 --> 03:54:02.480]  i'd be afraid to go down that path you know any normal human on earth is going to end up depressed
[03:54:02.480 --> 03:54:08.800]  and semi-suicidal after that process as opposed to me saying how you cure depression is to wake up
[03:54:08.800 --> 03:54:12.320]  and take control of your life and build a life you're happy with and people attack me like i'm
[03:54:12.320 --> 03:54:17.440]  the monster i don't like it's really crazy how violently people defend you're up against a big
[03:54:17.440 --> 03:54:24.240]  industry uh andrew and paul i'm done it just also riveting riveting radio and tv sorry paul go ahead
[03:54:24.240 --> 03:54:29.120]  yeah it's also because their whole life is invested in this not this life story this
[03:54:29.120 --> 03:54:33.840]  narrative that they've told themselves for years and years maybe decades in some cases
[03:54:33.840 --> 03:54:39.600]  that their lack of willpower their lack of success in their own personal life is due to this outside
[03:54:39.600 --> 03:54:45.520]  force so then they never have to take responsibility for it andrew absolutely and and this is the
[03:54:45.520 --> 03:54:50.160]  number one goal of a loser when i said depression is relieved with depressive losers i obviously
[03:54:50.160 --> 03:54:53.760]  weren't talking about military veterans who lost their legs of course i wasn't i was talking about
[03:54:53.760 --> 03:54:58.560]  the 19 year old in their bedroom with nothing wrong with their life and the number one goal
[03:54:58.560 --> 03:55:04.800]  of a loser is to absolve responsibility i'm fat because of my thyroid i'm sad because of depression
[03:55:04.800 --> 03:55:10.480]  i drink because of alcoholism i no matter what it is it's not their fault and they will do anything
[03:55:10.480 --> 03:55:15.280]  to defend their excuse as long as they can defend their excuse that's the most important thing for
[03:55:15.280 --> 03:55:19.040]  them they don't want to sit there and go well this andrew tape guy he grew up broke and he made
[03:55:19.040 --> 03:55:23.760]  something of himself and i grew and i grew up privileged and i made nothing of myself i must
[03:55:23.760 --> 03:55:27.760]  have caught something from the sky now they just don't accept reality they don't want to face fats
[03:55:27.760 --> 03:55:33.040]  and this is when i when i put it out there to them the reason everyone got so instantly angry
[03:55:33.040 --> 03:55:36.560]  was because they knew it was true if i were to tweet something like i'm the king of the world
[03:55:36.560 --> 03:55:40.560]  no one would care because it's not true when you state something which is a fact which is
[03:55:41.200 --> 03:55:45.840]  you know indisputable that's the reason everybody got so angry and that's the reason
[03:55:45.840 --> 03:55:50.400]  they were so desperate that's the point they're so militant about it i've never seen people as
[03:55:50.400 --> 03:55:54.640]  militant about any maybe apart from islamic terrorists maybe they're the only ones more
[03:55:54.640 --> 03:55:59.600]  militant if you insult islam or whatever but i mean it's like what you spend like when i was 17
[03:55:59.600 --> 03:56:04.400]  i was a bit depressed because i was a bit of a loser who didn't have anything going on in my life
[03:56:04.400 --> 03:56:08.800]  as soon as i found what i wanted to do with my life as the most happiest i'd ever been again
[03:56:08.800 --> 03:56:12.480]  we're not saying that's the case for everyone but that's the general trend i want to throw you
[03:56:12.480 --> 03:56:16.960]  another one andrew's the final minute here so of course men are five times more likely to commit
[03:56:16.960 --> 03:56:23.600]  suicide given societies you know increased pressure on men to succeed does that validate your point
[03:56:23.600 --> 03:56:28.080]  that depression is caused by a lack of achievement or is it more to do with the fact that women you
[03:56:28.080 --> 03:56:33.440]  know find it easier to get emotional support for depression that's a really really interesting
[03:56:33.440 --> 03:56:37.840]  question and my answer on that is that i genuinely believe if you ask a lot of these people who are
[03:56:37.840 --> 03:56:42.960]  depressed uh why they're depressed the word lonely often pops up and i don't believe a woman can
[03:56:42.960 --> 03:56:48.880]  ever be lonely the way a man is i know very low quality very ugly very stupid females who still
[03:56:48.880 --> 03:56:53.200]  manage to go to the nightclub and not go home alone if you're a man of a particular standing if
[03:56:53.200 --> 03:56:57.200]  you're a man without any particular merits if you're a man without any money without any intelligence
[03:56:57.200 --> 03:57:01.120]  you're not particularly good looking there's a degree of loneliness that you're going to suffer
[03:57:01.120 --> 03:57:06.000]  that a woman's never going to suffer that does not make depression real that makes loneliness real
[03:57:06.000 --> 03:57:11.520]  and that means that humans have evolved biologically to seek a mate and you're unhappy that you don't
[03:57:11.520 --> 03:57:15.520]  have a girlfriend that's fine that does not prove depression is real under any circumstance that
[03:57:15.520 --> 03:57:19.280]  proves loneliness is real and that's the reason i believe that men suffer from it more than women
[03:57:19.280 --> 03:57:24.720]  because men can you know suffer loneliness like a woman really never can i don't believe
[03:57:24.720 --> 03:57:28.400]  there's very many women out there who could ever be as genuinely as lonely as some of these men are
[03:57:28.400 --> 03:57:32.160]  and that's my it's my point of view on all right andrew we've got about 30 seconds left
[03:57:32.160 --> 03:57:37.520]  tell people where they can find you on twitter and your website um my website just shows me uh
