[00:00.000 --> 00:12.400]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.400 --> 00:30.960]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones I really do feel
[00:30.960 --> 00:35.880]  like I'm living in the twilight zone more and more I know a lot of you do as well thanks for
[00:35.880 --> 00:46.560]  joining us it's Wednesday already the first day it's hard to believe of August 2012 and we
[00:46.560 --> 00:54.040]  will be here for the next three hours wow we're to begin it finally broke in a big way in mainstream
[00:54.040 --> 01:03.720]  media yesterday in the London Guardian the Associated Press the Asia Times we're really all
[01:03.720 --> 01:11.960]  over the place that the main force in fact the majority of the fighters in Syria are al-Qaeda
[01:11.960 --> 01:18.120]  now now that was the case over a year ago in the whole Libya liberation and I say that as a joke
[01:18.120 --> 01:26.600]  by the Peace Prize president started and we had guest on multiple guests from Tripoli and other
[01:26.600 --> 01:33.560]  areas like Tarpley in fact we should get Tarpley on sometime this week just on this Syria situation
[01:33.560 --> 01:38.280]  before we go off into how wonderful big government is but I do want to get Tarpley's take on all
[01:38.280 --> 01:44.520]  this Max Kaiser is going to be joining us coming up in the third hour he says the collapse is
[01:44.520 --> 01:49.160]  imminent and I really don't usually hear him talk like that he says there's going to be a
[01:49.160 --> 01:53.400]  collapse of JPMorgan and stuff like that down the road because their derivatives and since then
[01:54.200 --> 01:57.800]  it's turned out it was a billion two billion eight billion ten billion twenty billion forty
[01:57.800 --> 02:02.600]  billion of course all that's leverage so a billion's more like hundreds of billions depending
[02:02.600 --> 02:11.800]  on how the derivatives are structured so all of that is coming up today here on the worldwide
[02:11.800 --> 02:18.040]  transmission and as usual it I'm getting the point where I'm just completely overwhelmed I know a
[02:18.040 --> 02:27.560]  lot of you are it's all just cuckoo land crazy the news we've got it's crazy it is it is so bizarre
[02:27.560 --> 02:32.600]  all of it I don't even know how to respond to it I mean we knew it was coming but to see it unfold
[02:33.400 --> 02:37.800]  is quite another thing so we're going to be going over al Qaeda turns the tide for rebels
[02:37.800 --> 02:46.440]  in battle for eastern Syria and then the article basically goes on to describe them as freedom
[02:46.440 --> 02:55.160]  fighters and of course I predicted that down the road we would see a move to then invade
[02:55.160 --> 03:02.280]  Syria and Libya to deal with al Qaeda NATO funds al Qaeda the US funds al Qaeda the so-called
[03:02.280 --> 03:07.160]  interests that have hijacked our nations do and then we'll have to have a of course occupation
[03:08.840 --> 03:15.240]  as is now happening all over Africa to stop the spread of the rats that the Pied Piper himself
[03:15.880 --> 03:23.080]  has released it's the old Pied Piper story and they're getting ready for this big battle between
[03:23.080 --> 03:31.000]  Shiites and Sunnis with the west well the Ayatollah the head honcho said war within weeks that's the
[03:31.000 --> 03:41.240]  kind of news we have here today and so it'll be the Wahhabi backed al Qaeda g-hotting all of the
[03:41.240 --> 03:48.920]  moderate states like Egypt Libya and Syria getting rid of them and then g-hotting around and putting
[03:48.920 --> 03:57.160]  women back in burkas and all the rest of it on TV and then it will at the same time be bomb the
[03:57.160 --> 04:04.360]  daylights out of the Iranians and attack Hezbollah forces in Lebanon and then the news is going to
[04:04.360 --> 04:09.720]  say when there's terror attacks in the country al Qaeda did it and then al Qaeda is based in Iran
[04:09.720 --> 04:20.680]  that's like saying lax luther lex luther is the friend of spider man or is spider man
[04:21.720 --> 04:25.720]  of course it's a character from a whole different genre but anyone who knows comic books will
[04:25.720 --> 04:30.680]  understand that instantly or maybe like saying lex luther is actually superman people are like
[04:30.680 --> 04:35.400]  well that's obviously not true well it means the same thing here they're always saying Iran runs al
[04:35.400 --> 04:43.160]  qaeda it's like saying it's like saying coke runs Pepsi or Chevy runs Ford or uh the 49ers
[04:43.160 --> 04:48.600]  are the redskins i mean it's just not true but it doesn't matter the public knows football and they
[04:48.600 --> 04:55.880]  know they know comic book characters they don't know who al qaeda is who hezbollah is and that
[04:55.880 --> 05:04.680]  is why we're slaves that is why we fail hi folks this is alex jones and i want to tell you about

[08:17.720 --> 08:37.000]  well the head iotola over in iran is saying that there will be war with the west within
[08:37.000 --> 08:41.400]  weeks we're going to be going over that paul watson has an article on that at info wars.com
[08:41.400 --> 08:50.600]  they are relaunching cony 2012 you know it was exposed as a total pr stunt fraud as a pretext
[08:50.600 --> 08:55.160]  to invade every country of africa they've had congress try to pass resolution saying they can
[08:55.160 --> 09:00.280]  invade any country because of county who hasn't been seen in almost six years and controlled a
[09:00.280 --> 09:09.800]  few hundred square miles so cony 2012 style pr stunt to sell war on syria and they've also
[09:09.800 --> 09:20.040]  been caught putting out fake photos of massacres fake television broadcast of massacres and we're
[09:20.040 --> 09:24.840]  going to be showing some of that if you're watching in prison planet dot tv if not just go to paul
[09:24.840 --> 09:32.760]  watson's article also erin dyke's photo article last night going over all of that wag the dog
[09:32.760 --> 09:41.240]  media publish photoshop forgery but we could show that right now to sell image of war torn syria
[09:43.160 --> 09:47.880]  and you can see the real image on bottom and on top they put the bombed out city behind them
[09:47.880 --> 09:53.160]  this is standard in fact if we go to erin dyke's article it's more detailed in that one it's
[09:53.160 --> 09:58.360]  titled wag the dog media publish photoshop forgery to sell image of war torn syria
[09:58.360 --> 10:04.920]  we show when cnn got caught doing fake broadcast in showing dead bodies they themselves had had
[10:04.920 --> 10:11.080]  al-qaeda kill i mean it's just beyond throwing a baby out of incubator lies that turned out
[10:11.080 --> 10:16.680]  was totally made up to say well we have to attack iraq they threw babies out of incubators and they
[10:16.680 --> 10:26.360]  have gone beyond that now and every major city across eastern syria is run by al-qaeda and they
[10:26.360 --> 10:32.280]  are just lining up jews and christians and killing them blowing up churches blowing up synagogues
[10:32.280 --> 10:39.480]  because that was one of the most open societies for religion in the middle east and the women were
[10:39.480 --> 10:44.600]  most of college graduates and did not wear burkas well they are now they're going to be sexually
[10:44.600 --> 10:51.560]  mutilated they're going to wear burkas and they're going to be cia funded and commanded and you better
[10:51.560 --> 10:56.440]  shut up and accept it what are you you know anti-american you got to support al-qaeda
[10:56.440 --> 11:02.600]  this is how ridiculous it is this is why i said 9 11's an inside job al-qaeda was created by the
[11:02.600 --> 11:09.480]  bankers that run this country al-qaeda is protected against russia against the serbs they are used
[11:09.480 --> 11:14.840]  everywhere a lot of times the low level jihadis below them actually believe in what they're doing
[11:14.840 --> 11:22.520]  but the people on top of it are on record british intelligence us intelligence
[11:24.440 --> 11:29.480]  and israeli intelligence occasionally german french or pakistan intelligence
[11:29.480 --> 11:35.880]  turkish intelligence they are the how many years have i told you for a decade at least
[11:35.880 --> 11:42.360]  that al-qaeda is the sword of the new world order i've called al-qaeda the key of the new world order
[11:42.360 --> 11:48.440]  the skeleton key what's a skeleton key do well if you've got say an office building and you know
[11:48.440 --> 11:55.800]  you've got safe almost 50 people like we have working in this 16 000 square foot facility
[11:57.320 --> 12:04.440]  there are certain doors like it rooms that you have to have a master key i have a master key
[12:04.440 --> 12:13.880]  a skeleton key that opens every door in this facility and that is what the new world order is
[12:14.760 --> 12:21.080]  i have a master code we've got code locks as well that will open the doors i have a skeleton key
[12:21.720 --> 12:27.640]  and that's what al-qaeda is it is just a made up cut out army where they can organize jihadis
[12:27.640 --> 12:35.880]  terrorist groups mercenaries mi6 uh sas commandos dress them up it's just a cut out of why is there
[12:35.880 --> 12:39.800]  a checkpoint on the highway mommy why is there a drone why are they trying to force me with a
[12:39.800 --> 12:45.160]  knock you with a shot uh why is the irs taking money out of my bank account no judge no jury well
[12:45.160 --> 12:52.120]  honey things changed after 9 11 where they ran drills of the towers being blown up tripod to
[12:52.120 --> 12:55.640]  that day they said it wasn't true at the time later confirmed in congressional testimony
[12:55.640 --> 13:03.400]  i can go on for about 10 hours if you like on 9 11 the official story is a lie and it was used to
[13:03.400 --> 13:09.800]  take our freedoms and now in the la times associated press french news agency london
[13:09.800 --> 13:17.640]  guardian asia times german national television are reporting that al-qaeda works for nato al-qaeda
[13:17.640 --> 13:25.000]  always worked for nato it isn't oh they made them in 79 under the under the big number zenski
[13:25.000 --> 13:28.840]  and then they used them in the 80s against the russians and then they then they turned bad no
[13:30.520 --> 13:35.560]  larry king live two days after 9 11 somebody's got to find it had bandar bush on this is nickname
[13:35.560 --> 13:42.200]  the saudi prince the u.s ambassador from from saudi arabia saudi arabia's ambassador to the
[13:42.200 --> 13:48.920]  u.s and larry king was calling him a coward and a scum calling ben laudan that and he said do not
[13:48.920 --> 13:55.880]  do this my friend he is a great man he is known as a hero and larry king went oh i got you yeah
[13:55.880 --> 14:03.320]  okay and moved on see because over there he's a hero used to radicalize to then create new armies
[14:04.760 --> 14:10.360]  isn't the bankers took over america so they've got an al-qaeda force that will attack us or
[14:10.360 --> 14:16.200]  take the blame for attacks and saudi arabia supplies its intelligence agents who do drills
[14:16.200 --> 14:20.280]  which they believe you know helps oh we're gonna do some drills to see if we can hijack jets you
[14:20.280 --> 14:23.880]  know you'll just see if you can get on board with box cutters and stuff they nerve gas them that's
[14:23.880 --> 14:28.360]  what the the only real calls that got through on air phones where there's gas we can't breathe

[14:41.960 --> 14:50.120]  their cover designation i could literally go for 10 hours straight in fact i think when we do that

[16:07.800 --> 16:09.800]  and a lot of them have spoken out on this show
[16:11.880 --> 16:17.240]  they always juxtapose the heroes versus us we're the bad men no we're just people that are willing
[16:17.240 --> 16:21.640]  to face the facts you know the facts are the facts even if you live in denial that 9 11 wasn't an
[16:21.640 --> 16:28.920]  inside job it still is it's still sitting right there and the people running things are involved
[16:28.920 --> 16:34.680]  in it norad stood down there were drills of the buildings being hit including the pentagon
[16:34.680 --> 16:41.560]  cia drills all the same stories all the same mo all the same setup and i've been sitting here

[17:17.480 --> 17:27.320]  my research i know what happened but but here we are today they think you're so stupid the system

[18:43.080 --> 18:47.000]  isn't that reasonable that's the new talking point the teleprompter readers read off of
[18:48.120 --> 18:52.120]  and he was like no you know big guns make the bad guys die
[18:55.640 --> 18:58.520]  big guns if there's rioting and collapsing you need them

[26:46.920 --> 26:52.760]  who was in the theater the police were there waiting when everyone tried to get out within
[26:52.760 --> 26:57.000]  minutes to take their cell phones they they didn't want those getting out yeah when you shoot somebody
[26:57.000 --> 27:01.560]  in the back uh at the train station there in san francisco you didn't want that either you said
[27:01.560 --> 27:07.080]  the guy attacked you he was in handcuffs you executed him probably a test yeah yeah they took
[27:07.080 --> 27:14.520]  all their cell phones a few weeks ago there at the aurora shooting and we're getting her how far
[27:14.520 --> 27:25.160]  away are we from getting her on okay good i want to try to get her on today um or it doesn't even
[27:25.160 --> 27:31.800]  matter you can do it while you're running the show now uh continuing here ladies and gentlemen

[27:55.080 --> 28:00.840]  to quote stop al qaeda really they just want to set the precedent to do things like that oh yeah
[28:00.840 --> 28:07.000]  that's in the army's own reports that's who they are that's what they like to do if they would do
[28:07.000 --> 28:11.160]  that would they stage the theater shooting and of course the answer is of course they would
[28:11.160 --> 28:16.280]  and the answer is they did the evidence is overwhelming all the telltale signs it's
[28:16.280 --> 28:22.440]  swappily done because they don't even care they took everyone's cell phones and did what they do
[28:22.440 --> 28:27.240]  everywhere they took the children to a government facility overnight even though parents were trying
[28:27.240 --> 28:31.160]  to get them and they do those drills at your school at your government training camp at
[28:31.160 --> 28:38.040]  your reeducation center your quote independent school district run by the globalist they do

[28:55.560 --> 29:02.200]  simultaneously oh but let's just ask the guy that supposedly everybody says did it the guy
[29:02.200 --> 29:06.840]  that looks like ronald mcdonnell they say is the joker oh he can't talk in the last two court
[29:06.840 --> 29:11.560]  hearings and sits there a textbook person it looks like they've had electroshock therapy

[33:34.120 --> 33:41.160]  the radio and once in person he died yesterday in los angeles at 86 our interviews with the
[33:41.160 --> 33:47.800]  writer and cousin of al goer it's kind of an embarrassment for him i guess that is up at
[33:47.800 --> 33:53.800]  info wars dot com but i tell you so many people we've interviewed just the time comes and they're
[33:53.800 --> 33:59.000]  dead whether it's charlton heston or people i've talked to off air but not on air like
[33:59.000 --> 34:06.040]  ernaz borgnein and cart vana getting so many others that's why yesterday i was on the phone with
[34:06.040 --> 34:11.800]  tyrell ventura who's really good friends with harry dean stanton so i'm a huge fan of and i just
[34:11.800 --> 34:16.280]  said look make it happen get him i want an interview with harry dean stanton he said it's

[34:44.840 --> 34:51.480]  such a care especially because you know they're not going to be here forever i'm now digressing
[34:51.480 --> 34:55.640]  again the information has gotten so heavy so
[34:58.360 --> 35:02.920]  wild that reality is being turned upside down
[35:05.080 --> 35:08.680]  we had a guest yesterday that was just saying alex you're describing a world
[35:08.680 --> 35:14.920]  turned upside down i'm the weirdo because i didn't want to watch the opening of the olympics and
[35:14.920 --> 35:20.760]  have women kissing and men humping each other because that's not what i want my four-year-old to see
[35:22.680 --> 35:25.720]  and i've talked about that being in the olympics and it was in the news
[35:26.280 --> 35:31.720]  and i i'll even saw comments on youtube saying i i'm not trendy uh because i don't want my
[35:32.280 --> 35:40.040]  four-year-old being confused and i'm a bad person because i don't want chic filet in
[35:40.040 --> 35:46.280]  boston in chicago the cities are openly engaging in racketeering organized crime just like i told
[35:46.280 --> 35:51.240]  you mayor bloomberg organized crime to tell police to stand down until we turn our guns in trying to
[35:51.240 --> 35:56.920]  hold disarmed populations hostage to only place that type of terrorism would work is because the
[35:56.920 --> 36:02.360]  people are already disarmed so the criminal state and the average criminal have the have the monopoly
[36:02.360 --> 36:07.080]  of force which is the way they like it but they're now saying they're going to go ahead with not giving
[36:07.080 --> 36:11.000]  them permits and things which a permit is a right to do something that would be illegal
[36:11.000 --> 36:17.400]  that's what licensure is we're all slaves folks it's not a privilege to travel it's not a privilege
[36:17.400 --> 36:22.920]  to own a gun but the average cop thinks it is this is part of the ongoing brainwashing now
[36:22.920 --> 36:27.080]  all over the country they're just inoculating children without parental consent they're giving
[36:27.080 --> 36:31.800]  children as young as 10 years old abortions without parental consent government is just
[36:31.800 --> 36:38.680]  exercising raw power and saying oh you're waking up oh you don't like what we're doing how about
[36:38.680 --> 36:43.320]  30 000 drones and they are going to be used to surveil you and they are going to be weaponized
[36:43.320 --> 36:49.560]  janet napolitano has announced that i've got an article here out of human events that just says
[36:50.200 --> 36:52.280]  they're coming whether you like it or not
[36:56.040 --> 37:01.240]  really they're coming whether i like it or not and then they think we're so done
[37:01.240 --> 37:09.000]  they think we're so pathetic that they publicly land al-qaeda in triply over 3000 of them with
[37:09.000 --> 37:15.400]  us british and other special forces leading them so they could go and blow up
[37:17.400 --> 37:23.160]  chiite mosque and blow up jewish uh synagogues and blow up churches oh yeah that's what they're
[37:23.160 --> 37:29.240]  doing they're blowing up churches in syria still in libya it's in the back of the newspaper now
[37:29.240 --> 37:34.360]  i see it every couple days oh yeah this church got burned these this synagogue got blown up
[37:34.360 --> 37:39.080]  and it's just like oh how cute oh oh a sod hurts the children
[37:40.920 --> 37:46.840]  they've got the koni 2012 style people out literally recycling known lies because they
[37:46.840 --> 37:53.000]  have nothing but disdain for you because you buy into what they shovel at you
[37:53.000 --> 38:02.680]  and now they have injected al-qaeda as they did in the east of libya and then in triply and from
[38:02.680 --> 38:09.480]  the south now they've injected him all over syria and again we told you about this a year ago it was
[38:09.480 --> 38:14.600]  already going on but now here it is and remember a year ago oh we gotta do something about syria
[38:14.600 --> 38:20.040]  he's being mean to protesters you mean people firing rocket propelled grenades into police stations
[38:20.040 --> 38:28.440]  you mean people blowing up churches i see it in the foreign news every day new churches blown
[38:28.440 --> 38:35.160]  up or burned down in libya it was 40 000 blacks the number is much higher now blacks are part of
[38:35.160 --> 38:41.560]  africa believe it or not i mean if they can't have africa what can they have and the jihadis
[38:41.560 --> 38:45.800]  that have come in from saudi arabia and other areas are lining them up and shooting them
[38:45.800 --> 38:51.800]  and hacking up the women and children with machetes and it's like well that's what you
[38:51.800 --> 38:56.280]  gotta do you gotta break a few eggs to make an omelet and you don't hear any of the black leaders
[38:56.280 --> 39:01.160]  bought and paid for by the globalist pushing abortions on black people all day you don't hear
[39:01.160 --> 39:06.600]  a peep out of them because they're bought and paid for prestitute whores just like the conservative
[39:06.600 --> 39:15.480]  leadership that's out there pushing anti-gun garbage the only talk show host that's a conservative
[39:15.480 --> 39:20.760]  that hasn't been pushing gun restrictions is rush limbaugh i've done some monitoring on when they
[39:20.760 --> 39:25.720]  were here on the weekend drudge has been defending the second amendment because he's more of a
[39:25.720 --> 39:30.600]  constitutional libertarian freedom type but i mean all the others are yeah it's time to turn the
[39:30.600 --> 39:35.960]  guns in because if you want the sponsors and you want the support of the system the minute you
[39:35.960 --> 39:44.280]  come out for gun control the fortune 500 lines up to give you money i could i could still sell out
[39:44.280 --> 39:49.480]  ladies and gentlemen i could snap my fingers and start endorsing the new world order and
[39:49.480 --> 39:55.960]  10 million dollars would come in in probably a month just oh here's 10 million boom i still get
[39:55.960 --> 40:00.120]  reached out to you by establishment types oh things would go real well you could still get
[40:00.120 --> 40:04.680]  that national show they're ready to meet with you in new york right now they're ready to they got
[40:04.680 --> 40:10.680]  the contract right now oh yeah let me see that contract i mean ladies and gentlemen because
[40:10.680 --> 40:17.720]  they got endless fake money they just they just zeros and ones in the jp morgan computer bank
[40:18.280 --> 40:24.120]  you can't buy me with that you can't buy me threatening my family you can't buy me threatening
[40:24.120 --> 40:31.880]  my children you cannot get the hands on this soul it belongs to the creator of the universe it
[40:31.880 --> 40:40.920]  doesn't belong to you i don't want to be bought off by you you don't have anything i want
[40:43.240 --> 40:48.520]  i won't sell out for money but i've said it i would i i i subconsciously have analyzed my
[40:48.520 --> 40:53.640]  own mind i know you've probably analyzed yours the only thing i would even entertain selling out for
[40:53.640 --> 41:02.760]  or isn't selling out at all is freedom that's the thing you don't have to sell it for but yeah
[41:03.400 --> 41:07.480]  things are so bad you do get desperate you do start believing in lesser of two evils
[41:07.480 --> 41:11.240]  even though that's the incremental thing that brought us to where we are now the compromising
[41:13.480 --> 41:17.400]  i mean i would love to believe in mit romney i would love to believe he would stop the tsa
[41:17.400 --> 41:22.840]  groping i would love to believe they would stop it it's not going to happen folks because the system
[41:22.840 --> 41:30.280]  wants this obama is a globalist frontman and and yeah he's got a crew of gangsters around him that's
[41:30.280 --> 41:35.880]  the only argument i've heard from larry pratt and joseph ferrah who are both intelligent men
[41:35.880 --> 41:41.480]  that's the only argument that makes any sense is yeah but mit romney calls the police on the
[41:41.480 --> 41:45.160]  neighbor when they're smoking pot on their back porch even though it's legal you know the neighbor
[41:45.160 --> 41:49.080]  it turns out is medical marijuana he lived next door to a 15 million dollar house you you know
[41:49.080 --> 41:53.080]  you live in a 10 million dollar house and uh you know you smell pot like a hundred yards away and
[41:53.080 --> 42:00.600]  you call the police on him first romney comes over knocks on the door and tells them not to i mean
[42:00.600 --> 42:07.480]  i'd be like you know get off my porch punk that's kind of a neighbor you'll call the police on
[42:07.480 --> 42:13.080]  you because your radio's up a little bit the point is is that that is almost like a sign of just
[42:13.080 --> 42:18.280]  neurotic goody two shoes behavior but that's all part of the front too he he's one of those globalists
[42:18.280 --> 42:23.400]  that does everything within the law well the law says he can have money offshore because he's
[42:23.400 --> 42:28.840]  you know with the right law firms and right uh you know arthur anerson type groups accounting firms
[42:28.840 --> 42:34.040]  the law says he can do all these things he does to the globalist they all create things and give
[42:34.040 --> 42:39.000]  themselves loopholes so they can sit back as a group and go with something and then no one gets the
[42:39.000 --> 42:45.480]  blame they've really figured this out ladies and gentlemen but the argument that actually rings
[42:45.480 --> 42:55.480]  true to me to a certain extent on mit romney is he's not a absolute hardcore terrorist communist
[42:55.480 --> 43:02.040]  or ear gun i mean it's scary that rama manuals dad was the head of the ear gun terrorist that
[43:02.040 --> 43:08.040]  brought israel into where they are today bombing british installations and that's pretty scary
[43:08.040 --> 43:16.840]  and then he's an idf officer uh it's it's it's scary um knowing that the un and all these foreign
[43:16.840 --> 43:22.680]  countries trying to take over the us i mean it's scary knowing that people like rama manual will
[43:22.680 --> 43:30.040]  do anything for power if they think they can get away with it that's the word thing about
[43:30.040 --> 43:34.440]  michael savage he i don't get a chance to listen to him a lot but i do you know maybe once a month
[43:34.440 --> 43:40.200]  when i see a clip or something and he's talked about rama manuals an ear gun terrorist he may
[43:40.200 --> 43:44.200]  stage terror attacks in america to take our freedom i've played that clip here before
[43:46.120 --> 43:50.920]  but then he'll say but we don't need semi autos you know we don't need big magazines it's just
[43:50.920 --> 43:57.480]  like did somebody threaten him i don't know how you threaten michael weiner i mean you know he did
[43:57.480 --> 44:08.040]  write um a book of poetry with another man that that people like um people like gore vidal would
[44:08.040 --> 44:13.800]  probably come to tears reading i mean how do you blackmail michael savage when everything's out
[44:13.800 --> 44:29.640]  there in books michael weiner who writes love poetry books with other men i mean i i i i just
[44:29.640 --> 44:35.240]  don't i just who are what's going on here why go on here and say rama manual is an ear gun
[44:35.240 --> 44:40.600]  terrorist and may blow us up and blame it on somebody which is exactly what eargun did and
[44:40.600 --> 44:47.480]  then or your gun and then he's over here saying we don't need our guns i just can't anybody not sell
[44:47.480 --> 44:53.560]  out can't anybody not act like this can't anybody as we get down to the wire not be cowards and just
[44:53.560 --> 45:00.040]  absolutely collectively go to the bathroom in their pants i mean is there any men left
[45:00.040 --> 45:11.480]  left i'll say this to the global controllers you are mad men you are mad men mad men
[45:11.480 --> 45:27.400]  mad men they want power at any cost at any price
[45:30.760 --> 45:35.400]  and they intend on getting it and they will wreck our civilization in the process
[45:35.400 --> 45:42.920]  yes i've talked a lot about don corezine don john corezine kind of Freudian slip there he's a
[45:42.920 --> 45:55.160]  mafia so i didn't mean to say don corezine don corleone never once did you come by my house for
[45:55.160 --> 46:05.720]  a cup of coffee now you're here seeking justice and if you would have done those things then even
[46:05.720 --> 46:13.080]  now those men would be suffering imagine john corezine making a 40 to one bet with other people's
[46:13.080 --> 46:19.320]  money and now it's coming out hsbc's running al-qaeda funds and aircraft and walkovias and
[46:19.320 --> 46:25.320]  and wells fargo's running the narcotics aircraft and 376 bill and and just just a lot i mean it's
[46:25.320 --> 46:32.920]  just like you got a bunch of crazy mafias running bio weapon companies and it just running around
[46:32.920 --> 46:38.680]  and like and and you know the old mafia 100 years ago 50 years ago who didn't traffic and kids you
[46:38.680 --> 46:44.280]  snatched out of schoolyards because there's a market and people that want to rape and kill little
[46:44.280 --> 46:51.720]  kids and now you do that and now the mafias of this world you know why the old mafias didn't
[46:51.720 --> 46:57.400]  allow stuff like that because they understood that once you allowed that you allowed the next
[46:57.400 --> 47:03.400]  thing and the next thing and the next thing and the next thing is the really wild thing to do
[47:03.400 --> 47:11.560]  is release a bio weapon that kills almost everybody as i forgot to have a water in here we
[47:11.560 --> 47:19.080]  guys do me a favor and give me a water or coffee i'm gonna hit a pollen burst plus at uh two today
[47:21.640 --> 47:27.720]  oh yeah i'm on drugs it's called uh it's called caffeine and superfoods
[47:29.400 --> 47:34.360]  oh man i don't know what to do anymore it's just uh the reality just keeps hitting me and hitting
[47:34.360 --> 47:39.160]  me and hitting me it's so real we were right about it all there's nothing too crazy for these people
[47:39.160 --> 47:46.840]  to do they are just maniac lunatics they are out of control they're not in control they're like
[47:47.480 --> 47:51.880]  it's like an arsonist is in control when they light your house on fire and then sit across the
[47:51.880 --> 47:57.960]  street in the bushes laughing as your home burns i mean you people are out of control you want to
[47:57.960 --> 48:03.160]  burn down society because you like to watch things burn you're not cracking eggs to make an omelet
[48:03.160 --> 48:10.360]  that's bad enough you like to crack eggs well you may think you can push people around and you
[48:10.360 --> 48:15.800]  may have the majority of the public dumbed down in a servile mind numb capacity but you don't have
[48:15.800 --> 48:23.000]  all of us in fact you don't have a lot of us and i'm seeing things across the country major signs
[48:23.560 --> 48:29.160]  richard reeves is going to join us in about 40 minutes in studio to talk about some of this
[48:29.160 --> 48:34.360]  things that really show me that the awakening is turbocharged right now
[48:36.360 --> 48:43.560]  and that is a danger point because there's intersecting lines here with our agenda of
[48:43.560 --> 48:49.080]  freedom and just being normal and never getting sick of a sunrise never getting tired of going
[48:49.080 --> 48:56.120]  fishing never get tired of a hot plate of enchiladas never get tired of just having fun never get
[48:56.120 --> 49:04.280]  tired of playing chess you know those of us that aren't just absolute demons and who love goodness
[49:04.280 --> 49:11.320]  doesn't mean we're even good but we we know we want to be good we we we're ashamed of the bad
[49:11.320 --> 49:17.880]  things we do being rude to somebody dominating somebody you know flying off the handle at somebody
[49:17.880 --> 49:25.480]  we're seen as weak by these people no no no no no you evil people out there we are restrained
[49:26.680 --> 49:33.000]  because we all have a little twist of cane and we all know if you start letting that little twist
[49:33.000 --> 49:39.480]  of cane into your heart well then it'll split you down the middle and you'll come alive
[49:39.480 --> 49:49.000]  and pretty soon there'll be blood pouring out of people's heads like a crimson highway
[49:52.200 --> 49:53.160]  to quote danzig
[49:55.240 --> 50:00.680]  so this is the situation we face and all of you little control freaks who can sit here
[50:00.680 --> 50:07.240]  in this decadent crust this thin ice you're on you're all trying to one up each other
[50:07.240 --> 50:11.240]  with evil you can accept because most of you aren't engaged in it most of you actually saw
[50:11.240 --> 50:17.080]  this evil you'd throw up and be freaked out go crawl up in a ball but you like to squawk around
[50:17.080 --> 50:21.080]  and hop around on the thin ice like you're part of it and like you've cozied up to it
[50:22.600 --> 50:28.440]  when the ice breaks and when you find out hell it and hot folks it's freezing cold in the ninth
[50:28.440 --> 50:37.640]  circle and when and when the thin veneer of civilization burns away like a meteor coming
[50:37.640 --> 50:50.520]  into the atmosphere remember that you asked for it remember that you begged for it remember you
[50:50.520 --> 50:59.480]  liked the lie and remember that you've owned it you've asked for it and believe me you're gonna
[50:59.480 --> 51:05.400]  get it the worst drought in 50 years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest
[51:05.400 --> 51:10.760]  half year on record 78 percent of the midwest corn belt is in drought conditions not only corn
[51:10.760 --> 51:16.680]  but soy alfalfa fruits vegetables and wheat are all impacted raising prices the cost to feed livestock

[54:52.680 --> 54:56.360]  meltdown and that's why they're getting the police and military ready for martial law it
[54:56.360 --> 55:00.680]  doesn't mean this is going to happen but the ayatollah over there says that their word is the
[55:00.680 --> 55:06.680]  wars within two weeks haven't heard them talk like that ever uh the ships are all getting
[55:06.680 --> 55:11.640]  lined up the al-qaeda forces are being released we're being told al-qaeda are now heroes i have
[55:11.640 --> 55:16.600]  articles here where they've got great discipline and are good guys and well you know they're helping
[55:17.240 --> 55:21.080]  but we but we may have to invade later to get rid of them it's like and then they'll have another
[55:21.080 --> 55:24.360]  group they put in or they remove it's like an endless war it's like you're a big military
[55:24.360 --> 55:29.880]  industrial complex you've got to finance the enemy it's like a simulant it's like you want to go play
[55:29.880 --> 55:36.520]  paintball you got to find another team to play against and the game is world domination so the
[55:36.520 --> 55:42.280]  enemy is there so you have a reason to take over and then you just move the enemy like a chess piece
[55:42.280 --> 55:47.000]  to the next place you're going to invade i mean it's so elementary and i just don't get why people
[55:47.000 --> 55:53.800]  don't understand this i mean zebigniew brzezinski wrote two books bragging how he did it they brag
[55:53.800 --> 56:02.200]  they only write these books for each other though and again a lot of people go well okay we're
[56:02.200 --> 56:06.520]  obviously the best in the west we come up with these evil plans the globalist hate us more than
[56:06.520 --> 56:13.240]  they hate the muslims folks they hate the poor people in the middle east so much and saw them
[56:13.240 --> 56:18.200]  as a threat a hundred years ago that they radicalized for 100 years the british empire and then others
[56:18.200 --> 56:24.280]  the most radical jihadis those people those people were i had almost no power a hundred years ago in
[56:24.280 --> 56:30.600]  the middle east and then the british empire then the nazis then the us go in there and arm every
[56:30.600 --> 56:35.480]  crazy group there is to blow the daylights out of that place because they don't want to compete
[56:36.040 --> 56:42.760]  with those people they have high IQs folks they're smart as smart as it gets they have destroyed
[56:42.760 --> 56:47.640]  their culture over there and they're going to destroy ours too what do you think the television
[56:47.640 --> 56:53.720]  is when you turn it on it's designed to screw you up now they wouldn't accept a devil culture like

[01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:25.160]  about five years ago the federal government and this is happening in other nations began funding
[01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:31.400]  senior citizen homes where there's cameras watching them uh these are retirees not folks that are
[01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:37.400]  even ill and then what they eat is monitored by smart refrigerators and other appliances that's
[01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:42.520]  all looked to smart meters that control the temperature in your house and they've admitted
[01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:49.960]  it this is the model of the new country just like uh germany's past laws where no new single
[01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:54.440]  family homes can be built you've got to live in government dormitories and now new york is
[01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:58.680]  getting ready to adopt this uh just like they're announcing what you can eat what you can do
[01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:02.600]  they're announcing of you if the owner of a company doesn't agree with their political agenda that
[01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:07.640]  you won't be allowed to have businesses in their cities aka chick filet they're arresting people
[01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:13.480]  that criticize olympic athletes mildly on twitter in england this is the new authoritarianism
[01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:19.000]  but it's all done for your safety and your own good of course as all authoritarian systems are
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:24.840]  now all over the world they're building with taxpayer money things like formula one billions
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:31.240]  and billions you know the cowboy stadium paid for by citizens what 1.2 billion here in austin
[01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:36.680]  hundreds of millions of tax incentives over the next decade tens of millions of free money uh
[01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:42.440]  uh we're actually paying for a multi-billionaire formula one guy who's so rich he gives three
[01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:46.520]  billion to this daughter two billion to that daughter they own the biggest houses in the us
[01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:51.800]  and if i don't pay my property taxes they will come and auction my house and then if i don't
[01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:57.240]  leave they will send a swat team and they will kill me they will kill me to take my money and give
[01:09:57.240 --> 01:10:01.800]  it to a guy from england a gangster so his daughters can have three billion dollars a year
[01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:07.640]  just oh here honey your three billion or two billion for you you know uh and again this is
[01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:15.320]  the model this is the insider choosing the winners now tens of billions of taxpayer money has been
[01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:23.000]  given to companies like salindra to build nothing but the old robert mewler municipal airport is
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:27.560]  right in the middle of austin and they have turned part of it into a movie studio the other part is

[01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:36.600]  are snooping pods and then the police stations nationwide they're getting federal grants for

[01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:50.840]  little grid right there you now communicate with those lights they flicker at a rate you can't see
[01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:58.520]  oh i went and read the patent oh it also can do whatever you want to the human mind literally
[01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:07.480]  turning them into zombies into biological robots androids oh it's 2012 and the elite are at least
[01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:12.360]  30 to 40 years ahead of us so it's really what's 30 years to be conservative ahead
[01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:22.600]  it's really 2042 we're in the year 2042 according to globalist operations
[01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:29.000]  that's why they're now publicly rolling out centralized high-tech hubs that get privileges
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:33.960]  that aren't real high-tech hubs but are facsimiles that are really prisons and they're going to sell
[01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:40.840]  it as a status thing to be able to be involved in all of this and to be part of it just thought i'd
[01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:46.520]  mention that little little jiblet for you and oh they are now announcing what i told you years ago
[01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:52.120]  the drones are in the skies there will be 30 000 and they are to be armed and they are being armed
[01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:59.240]  and uh you are to be attacked and you're going to pay for it as you're replaced because the elite
[01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:02.920]  believe they're going to replace humanity and they're going to merge with the machines does that
[01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:07.480]  mean it's really going to happen i don't know the wedgewoods the galtons the huxleys the darwins
[01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:13.080]  all that are married in the 1850s to create supermen by the third generation almost all the
[01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:17.080]  children died or were totally insane or mentally retarded
[01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:23.960]  so they're probably not this is not going to work they're probably just going to destroy everybody
[01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:29.400]  which is what their master wants them to do to begin with but they're just dancing off the edge of
[01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:39.400]  cliff and the general public is watching stuff like this key curtain immo article abc to run drama
[01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:45.720]  demonizing militias they've bought the show they tend to produce it we're a veteran an army veteran
[01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:49.720]  three tours in afghanistan oh that's the hero of course in real life that's the number one enemy
[01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:53.720]  of the globalist in their own files they say you're the main enemy comes back to his town
[01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:59.640]  town like donnie broscoe in texas and infiltrates where the locals aren't doing what the government
[01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:03.000]  says they're calling him militias they're really just citizens not being slaves because they've
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:07.480]  done actuaries they know texas is one of the main threats uh yeah they've done a lot of
[01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:12.280]  main threats uh yeah they wouldn't try that gun confiscation like a trainer here i assure you
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:16.760]  and just i don't know what it is the culture we're just ready to ready to do what it takes
[01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:23.320]  i'm just we're not too afraid to die in here uh and you know the issue uh expanding on all of this
[01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:30.040]  is he infiltrates and brings down the whole town that's run by evil patriots and guess what

[01:18:57.480 --> 01:19:04.280]  ed what real reeducation camps were like in eastern european countries the soviets took over but
[01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:08.120]  just tailored to america they get them all in the local sports stadium which fema has designated as
[01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:11.960]  the reeducation camp that's in the army documents that have been leaked in the army admits are real
[01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:18.280]  but it's no big deal you know reeducation camp it says in there that founding you know fathers
[01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:23.320]  and things like that are bad well in red dawn that's what they're saying the founding fathers
[01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:30.120]  are scumbags private property is bad me me me me america's a racist cesspit and that's but instead

[01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:40.600]  and everything and oh the good guy goes to the town and there's these folks that don't trust the

[01:25:38.920 --> 01:25:44.280]  tooth picture last night i was watching the olympics and in between the news to come on
[01:25:44.920 --> 01:25:54.280]  they said that iran was one of the cause of the 9-11 did you hear about that i know lately they
[01:25:54.280 --> 01:26:00.120]  have been saying that some informer told them i guess somebody told them that santa claus is real
[01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:04.920]  as well uh yeah in fact guys typed that in i saw that last week i didn't see it last night that i
[01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:09.800]  ran linked to 9-11 well yeah they just keep saying next they'll say kony was linked to it they'll have
[01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:15.160]  to invade africa look they're invading all the major african countries right now but south africa
[01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:21.160]  because it's already under control the globalist are african is under the name of some guy hadn't
[01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:26.680]  been seen in almost six years so so you're watching the news and they cut to news and said on nbc
[01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:33.960]  iran did 9-11 wow that's right that's one of the reasons why they got an attack that's what they said
[01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:42.120]  and was that national nbc if yes i was up uh late night watching the olympics and in between the
[01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:46.760]  the events they they do a little news segment and he literally woke my eyes up i just cannot
[01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:51.480]  believe what i just heard no you know that's what they do they just move into they move the al-qaeda
[01:26:51.480 --> 01:26:56.440]  piece around wherever they want to attack while the real al-qaeda is attacking free countries for them
[01:26:56.440 --> 01:27:01.880]  that's how dumb they think we are i knew they'd been saying that but um i did not know that they
[01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:08.280]  were even doing that during the olympics yeah when you sit down to watch television they are just
[01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:15.240]  bombarding you with brainwashing yeah here it is judge orders yeah that's that judge in new york
[01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:21.720]  just totally made up judge orders taliban al-qaeda and iran to pay six billion and 9-11 families but
[01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:27.720]  not the precious little saudi arabians and so now they're going to be grabbing the bank accounts
[01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:34.280]  of anything iran connected saying it's for 9-11 i guess that's unbelievable meanwhile they've got
[01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:40.360]  al-qaeda launching attacks for nato everywhere and i did find the article yep there it is a federal
[01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:45.640]  magistrate judge has ruled and if a judge says al-qaeda did it and a judge says obama cares
[01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:51.000]  constitutional too judges said blacks weren't humans uh a federal magistrate judge has ruled
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:55.560]  that al-qaeda the taliban iran and hezbollah should pay more than six billion really those
[01:27:55.560 --> 01:27:59.960]  groups all kill each other but they they they did it together everybody but who really did it is
[01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:05.880]  there in damages of the families of victims on september 11th for supporting the attacks yes
[01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:11.560]  that's right they they the move is considered a symbolic gesture without expectation of
[01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:18.840]  collection of the penalties for the relatives judge magistrate judge frank bass made the ruling
[01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:25.720]  yesterday after federal judge george daniels uh decided last year that the militant groups and

[01:40:13.160 --> 01:40:17.480]  and they get a story of while they're the hero and how you're the bad guy and they get all these
[01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:22.600]  minions around them and they strut around in fancy suits and build big giant buildings to make you

[01:41:16.360 --> 01:41:23.720]  lies your power in that is the sign that i am not going to give in to fear i'm here i'm stepping up

[01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:36.600]  is about your destiny as a human on this planet what you do now and i was just plugging something

[01:41:49.480 --> 01:41:54.520]  thing this is what comes out of me and i said you can't argue with success can you and he said i guess
[01:41:54.520 --> 01:42:00.920]  you're right i'll just say who's shattered it was dr paul craig roppers he was standing in there
[01:42:00.920 --> 01:42:04.680]  you know i was like how you doing because they said he was shaking his head going man he's preaching
[01:42:04.680 --> 01:42:08.120]  they had him on skype before i went to him went out to the break and go yeah i know i'm preaching
[01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:13.640]  he goes well alex i understand you know you got all the proof that's all you need and i said listen
[01:42:13.640 --> 01:42:19.400]  you do it in your authoritative manner very professional that's all we have you on i can't
[01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:25.560]  help what i do you understand which i told him i said this is real buddy i'm bouncing off the walls
[01:42:25.560 --> 01:42:31.400]  during the breaks this is who i am i mean i know we've got a government putting poison in our water
[01:42:31.400 --> 01:42:37.240]  and bragging they do it to brain damages and give little kids cancer millions of them died from it
[01:42:38.200 --> 01:42:42.040]  harvard has come out and admitted it everybody's like oh harvard said it must be true folks
[01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:47.960]  listen that makes me real angry okay if i saw i mean i'm nobody special if i was at the shopping
[01:42:47.960 --> 01:42:53.560]  mall and saw some guy run up and like they do sort of stabbing people it wouldn't even be a
[01:42:53.560 --> 01:43:00.040]  courage thing i would immediately go over there and take the knife away from him and and and and
[01:43:00.040 --> 01:43:04.360]  i i'll i'll tell you what i'd do i'd probably stomp him to death because in that rage i wouldn't
[01:43:04.360 --> 01:43:11.000]  be able to control myself and and people like oh that that you know either you're a big mouth
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:17.640]  guy or you're a crazy man no i'm not i'm not a crazy man i know what i'll do because i've i've
[01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:21.320]  seen things like that happen i've had people mug me i've seen people attack other people
[01:43:22.040 --> 01:43:25.240]  i've seen somebody attack someone on the street corner i've pulled over and stomp the living
[01:43:25.240 --> 01:43:31.240]  daylights out of them because ladies and gentlemen that's a normal response when we're under attack
[01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:37.240]  is to get angry every mammal out there when it's under attack either tries to run and if you can't
[01:43:37.240 --> 01:43:44.360]  run it gets up and fights and we just need to find our humanity again that's all we've got to find
[01:43:44.360 --> 01:43:48.920]  and no amount of drones or surveillance or any of it's going to stop us once we know we've been
[01:43:48.920 --> 01:43:53.720]  drugged once we know we're under attack our body can then gear up and deal with it and our brain
[01:43:53.720 --> 01:43:58.280]  can work with it but we've got to first admit we're under attack we've got to first admit
[01:43:58.280 --> 01:44:02.440]  that we're under assault and people out there that serve this system have first got to admit
[01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:06.200]  even if some of you are evil you're not going to win serving what you're serving
[01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:11.880]  because you may think you're evil you don't know what evil is evil is every human on this planet
[01:44:11.880 --> 01:44:19.720]  dead evil is the end of humanity evil is the end of our future evil is the end of history
[01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:29.960]  that's what the globalist want i'm ranting joining us is richard reeves here radio talk show host
[01:44:31.080 --> 01:44:35.400]  all around the technology expert here that helps us from around the road and things
[01:44:36.120 --> 01:44:41.720]  and uh he sort of texted me last night going we did it we did it we beat do hers the cia work with
[01:44:41.720 --> 01:44:48.120]  claus barbie proud of that claus barbie folks the top nazi down in south america all of this stuff
[01:44:48.120 --> 01:44:55.880]  i've been around a lot of people and i'm physically not recoil out of fear it's it's he is the scary
[01:44:55.880 --> 01:45:00.680]  david do hers up close looks like one of the scariest people i've ever been around he looks
[01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:05.800]  like a vampire i mean he's ready for central casting for a re i mean a vampire uh and i buy
[01:45:05.800 --> 01:45:13.000]  bullhorned him i've been in his face i mean he is creepville creepville super evil and he's the guy
[01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:18.760]  that killed the tsa deal and then tried to act like he didn't uh big globalist uh not his own
[01:45:18.760 --> 01:45:23.320]  businessman given contracts by the cia and government for his energy company total front
[01:45:24.360 --> 01:45:31.480]  and mr cruz beat him yesterday and he even got up there and gave a a a a a winning speech you know
[01:45:31.480 --> 01:45:35.800]  a victory speech thinking i guess the black boxes was kicking and the message is and i heard this
[01:45:35.800 --> 01:45:40.120]  even on local radio they were covering polls yesterday on 590 all the callers and the polls
[01:45:40.120 --> 01:45:44.920]  show it was tsa unanimous legislature in the house says no more groping we're going to enforce
[01:45:44.920 --> 01:45:50.120]  existing laws he killed it and i said we get rid of the speaker of the house as well all of them
[01:45:50.920 --> 01:45:55.720]  and so that's a message and it's happening all over the country all these republicans go on fox
[01:45:55.720 --> 01:46:01.880]  news and say ban all simianos it's because they're all scared they love this republican democrat game
[01:46:01.880 --> 01:46:07.480]  of acting like they're fighting with each other it's over okay i gotta say the tea party is actually
[01:46:07.480 --> 01:46:11.800]  delivering in many levels richard reeves you're here with us tell us because you follow this
[01:46:11.800 --> 01:46:18.040]  very very closely they've rejected the uh carbon tax garbage transportation tax in georgia
[01:46:18.040 --> 01:46:22.280]  and in lana that was to raise tens of billions to take over everybody's life and smart growth them
[01:46:22.280 --> 01:46:27.080]  i mean there's just 19 billion just got cut a lot of exciting things are happening all over the
[01:46:27.080 --> 01:46:32.040]  country uh the senator republican trash and democratic trash are being thrown out whether
[01:46:32.040 --> 01:46:36.920]  it's specter or luger i mean that's why they're scared right now and showing everybody what they are
[01:46:36.920 --> 01:46:42.760]  pieces of trash there's nothing i like to see better than incumbents being fired establishment
[01:46:42.760 --> 01:46:49.320]  candidates not being elected alex this is an incremental victory albeit an incremental victory
[01:46:49.320 --> 01:46:54.520]  but let's think about the methodology of the new world order one of their number one tools to get
[01:46:54.520 --> 01:46:59.720]  this country where they've gotten us over the last hundred plus years is incrementalism
[01:46:59.720 --> 01:47:04.120]  and here we do have to celebrate this incremental victory against the new world order
[01:47:04.120 --> 01:47:08.120]  but because cruise at least sounds like alex you've been to his speeches i've been to i've
[01:47:08.120 --> 01:47:13.240]  been to two we will defeat the cfr vipers i've been to two ted cruise speeches we had one at the
[01:47:13.240 --> 01:47:18.280]  capital two three months ago we went down there reported on it uh when ram paul and ron paul
[01:47:18.280 --> 01:47:22.680]  spoke there and then i was at the texas state convention folks i was a republican delegate
[01:47:22.680 --> 01:47:27.640]  out of my precinct out of my uh senatorial district and i went to the texas state convention
[01:47:27.640 --> 01:47:36.120]  back uh in early june and i got to tell you a lot of the tea party folks are 80 90 awake and then
[01:47:36.120 --> 01:47:40.280]  there's the republican party right now is made up of three factions you've got the old establishment
[01:47:40.280 --> 01:47:45.880]  glp faction you've got the tea party faction that still wants to blow up stuff and then you've
[01:47:45.880 --> 01:47:53.240]  got the patriots faction so there's a three-way faction going on there so right now at least
[01:47:53.240 --> 01:47:59.960]  we may not be able to deliver a majority vote to be able to win uh on certain races with a full
[01:47:59.960 --> 01:48:05.240]  blown patriot candidate but we definitely have the proof now that we are at least big enough
[01:48:05.240 --> 01:48:09.320]  and bad enough to be a swing vote in this situation and here are the results right here
[01:48:09.880 --> 01:48:17.080]  with cruise 56 well 57 roughly and david dohurst 43 percent and it was like you said earlier
[01:48:17.080 --> 01:48:22.760]  they the ted crew probably ended up winning with a 30 margin because the word is out that david
[01:48:22.760 --> 01:48:29.240]  dohurst is exactly you know did exactly what you said about this anti tsa legislation that we had in
[01:48:29.240 --> 01:48:35.640]  2011 that you spearheaded that folks uh our listeners did and rick perry got destroyed for his
[01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:39.480]  garter cell things lying and seeing girls had to take a deadly vaccine that killed a bunch of them
[01:48:39.480 --> 01:48:44.200]  well plus rick perry was behind the scenes and killing that anti tsa legislation a lot of the
[01:48:44.200 --> 01:48:47.960]  new listeners are not going to know exactly what happened there in the texas state legislature in
[01:48:47.960 --> 01:48:55.240]  2011 back in may 2011 june 2011 alex and the listeners here locally in austin and in texas
[01:48:55.240 --> 01:48:59.400]  and nationwide we stormed the capital twice stormed the capital twice follow we didn't ask
[01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:02.760]  permission we stormed the capital right we stormed the capital i'm sure you can find
[01:49:02.760 --> 01:49:09.160]  youtube's on the youtube videos of that alex jones storms capital with the crowd that went down
[01:49:09.160 --> 01:49:14.680]  there we did we went down there stormed the capital we had a unanimous house of the state of texas
[01:49:14.680 --> 01:49:20.680]  ready to vote for a yeah hey libertarians stop asking for permits right i mean hey we own this
[01:49:20.680 --> 01:49:26.600]  country it's ours you're disgraceful all you locals that get permits well i tell you i think
[01:49:26.600 --> 01:49:29.800]  less of them are going to be doing i think we're just going to be doing more of what we did with
[01:49:29.800 --> 01:49:36.840]  storming the capital folks we went down there we had a unanimous texas state house ready to pass a
[01:49:36.840 --> 01:49:43.640]  true anti tsa legislative they passed it unanimously right and then the senate i think there was only
[01:49:43.640 --> 01:49:49.960]  two and then third hearst killed it do hearst and perry both combined to work against that
[01:49:49.960 --> 01:49:54.040]  legislation and i tell you one thing that happened at the texas state convention
[01:49:54.040 --> 01:49:58.840]  is ted cruise got out there and sounded sounded almost like alex jones so at the very least you
[01:49:58.840 --> 01:50:03.160]  know there are some questionable associations in ted cruise background no question about yeah the
[01:50:03.160 --> 01:50:08.440]  wife was cfr we're gonna have to see what happens there but i'll tell you what he's out there actually
[01:50:08.440 --> 01:50:13.880]  waking people up and educating people when he's talking so he know i gotta say this i more and more
[01:50:14.440 --> 01:50:20.280]  i i i think some of the strategies of campaign for liberty and ran paul's i just got mad early on
[01:50:20.280 --> 01:50:24.120]  but i actually think it away i'm starting to see these races it looks like we're taking over
[01:50:24.120 --> 01:50:28.920]  i think it might be actually what they said i we're i mean again i i i never say i'm that smart
[01:50:28.920 --> 01:50:33.320]  yeah well here's what i would say about david do hearst is is if he got into the us senate from
[01:50:33.320 --> 01:50:38.920]  texas from texas he at each and every opportunity would choose death to the constitution let me
[01:50:38.920 --> 01:50:43.240]  tell you something i physically i told you this is the capital i've been around him before that
[01:50:43.240 --> 01:50:48.200]  guy is scary i mean let me tell you i mean i got chills when he looked in my eyes well he showed
[01:50:48.200 --> 01:50:52.760]  his true colors on the tsa issue and the texas knew about it they were not fooled well i'm just
[01:50:52.760 --> 01:50:59.400]  telling you my gut very few people like you know danger will robinson when that guy looks at you

[01:55:14.520 --> 01:55:19.800]  minutes from now uh going back to richard reeves briefly richard all over the country we're seeing
[01:55:19.800 --> 01:55:26.600]  luger uh specter republican democrat they're all running i mean they're in trouble people are getting
[01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:31.800]  rid of them even with electronic fraud that the the landslides are so big they're not in uh you
[01:55:31.800 --> 01:55:36.920]  know able to cheat them and this is why they're panicking and having all the neocons called to
[01:55:36.920 --> 01:55:41.560]  ban guns now and they're calling to ban them they got legislation introduced to register you when
[01:55:41.560 --> 01:55:47.960]  you get ammo and ban semi-autos and all clips above ten mags i mean we're in trouble again we're
[01:55:47.960 --> 01:55:52.440]  winning but we're in trouble because the crooks are still in control so people have to understand
[01:55:52.440 --> 01:55:56.920]  we're in the fight of our lives we're in the fight we're not broke back in the ditch we can still beat
[01:55:56.920 --> 01:56:01.320]  these people but it's going to take deciding we're going to beat them it's going to take getting angry
[01:56:01.320 --> 01:56:06.520]  but i see the signs of that i mean richard ten years ago people would make fun of me walking down
[01:56:06.520 --> 01:56:11.240]  the street some of them now that never happens and i was with you ten years ago seeing that happen
[01:56:11.240 --> 01:56:16.600]  exactly uh so they're not making fun now exactly they're not making what do you make a do-hurst
[01:56:16.600 --> 01:56:22.760]  thinking that he'd won well i think he was just counting on the black box to kick in uh because
[01:56:22.760 --> 01:56:27.160]  he was claiming that you know he actually said well the people of texas the people of texas
[01:56:27.160 --> 01:56:31.800]  have chosen a a true patriot constitutionalist somebody that really uh is going to fight the
[01:56:31.800 --> 01:56:38.120]  federal government etc etc somebody that's not an establishment candidate and you know as if he'd
[01:56:38.120 --> 01:56:43.240]  won it was just crazy uh i don't know if that video is still up or not and notice he's he's
[01:56:43.240 --> 01:56:49.160]  now anti-establishment when people hear you work for the cocaine importation agency with claus barbie
[01:56:49.160 --> 01:56:53.560]  he finally started talking about his air force record and working for the cia people don't
[01:56:53.560 --> 01:56:58.040]  like hearing that they know the cia works for foreign banks now more and more exactly they're
[01:56:58.040 --> 01:57:04.120]  learning that uh so it's that's what is very encouraging of the about this the incrementalism
[01:57:04.120 --> 01:57:09.320]  is starting to shift the other way i tell you this morning i was happy i was smiling because i can say
[01:57:09.320 --> 01:57:14.040]  at least we've got a metric here that shows that we're doing some serious damage to the new world
[01:57:14.040 --> 01:57:18.600]  but what do they do when that happens they come out with tv shows that the militias are going to
[01:57:18.600 --> 01:57:22.200]  blow up police stations like abc's doing and then they're going to blow up police stations
[01:57:22.200 --> 01:57:27.160]  and blame it on us so get ready for all hades to break loose they're going to stage terror attacks
[01:57:27.160 --> 01:57:31.480]  and blame it on us well the colorado shooter thing was a perfect example and you were pointing
[01:57:31.480 --> 01:57:36.200]  out just the other day on your show saying look what did the american people do in response to
[01:57:36.200 --> 01:57:42.200]  the colorado shooter did they go beg for anti-gun legislation heck no they went out and bought more
[01:57:42.200 --> 01:57:48.520]  guns i gotta give credit to obama for one thing at least one thing that he has been the best
[01:57:48.520 --> 01:57:54.120]  gun salesman in history thank you oboe well yeah they keep misgaging us just because they got a

[02:02:50.840 --> 02:02:57.240]  thank you for uh ted anderson and as easy as he made transferring my ira over to first medal one
[02:02:57.240 --> 02:03:04.360]  thing that i would like uh to put a bug in your head to make you think about the island government
[02:03:04.360 --> 02:03:10.440]  is uh hiring people to go after the bankers for the international banker melee that they
[02:03:10.440 --> 02:03:15.720]  tried to pull in that country as well as ours i was just wondering if uh with this money bomb if
[02:03:15.720 --> 02:03:21.800]  you might consider uh legal arm uh i think if we sent uh subpoenas to a lot of these people that
[02:03:21.800 --> 02:03:27.640]  are doing unconstitutional acts saying you will be brought into court for uh your actions i think
[02:03:27.640 --> 02:03:33.480]  uh you might have a better you know i think cease and desist letters are important to people to
[02:03:33.480 --> 02:03:39.000]  say we're aware of your crimes you're on notice as citizens we should all send cease and desist
[02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:44.200]  letters cease and desist letters because that's the tort ahead of a lawsuit to all these globalists
[02:03:44.200 --> 02:03:49.320]  and we should file them in the newspaper people should buy ads in the newspaper full page if you
[02:03:49.320 --> 02:03:54.840]  can afford it tiny uh you know thing if you couldn't and do it on craigslist cease and desist to the
[02:03:54.840 --> 02:03:58.840]  globalist cease and desist to the department of defense working for the foreign bankers
[02:03:58.840 --> 02:04:03.160]  launching drones against us cease and desist against local police departments running legal
[02:04:03.160 --> 02:04:07.800]  checkpoints cease and desist against the just department shipping guns into mexico cease and
[02:04:07.800 --> 02:04:14.360]  desist the the nato and the pentagon funding al-qaeda and libyan syria that's an idea right
[02:04:14.360 --> 02:04:21.560]  there because that has weight in common law down the road then for a lawsuit just like all these
[02:04:21.560 --> 02:04:27.400]  you know libor scandal fixing the interest rates is an attack on us all again all the organized
[02:04:27.400 --> 02:04:33.160]  crimes coming out god is giving us a chance this always happens to see all the evil first
[02:04:33.160 --> 02:04:38.040]  and then if we don't make the right decision now and and and and turn the corner doesn't mean we'll
[02:04:38.040 --> 02:04:42.680]  get out of all this evil right away but if we don't make the decision to turn the corner to turn
[02:04:42.680 --> 02:04:47.880]  around spiritually i mean it's a it's a physical decision as well you just got to say i make the
[02:04:47.880 --> 02:04:52.360]  decision everything else flows out of that nothing will happen when you say oh it's too big it's too
[02:04:52.360 --> 02:04:58.840]  hard you got to say i decide to fight evil i decide to wake up i decide to resist everything flows out

[02:10:23.400 --> 02:10:28.760]  there'd be an article five years ago then three years ago is every few few few days now hundreds
[02:10:28.760 --> 02:10:36.280]  of articles a day in blogs newspapers tv announcing foreign banks took over they do control derivatives
[02:10:36.280 --> 02:10:40.040]  if you don't do what they say they'll implode the economy we're holding you hostage but we
[02:10:40.040 --> 02:10:45.560]  know best we're the technocrats unelected tyranny is good we're gonna forcibly inoculate you and
[02:10:45.560 --> 02:10:49.640]  they have austinites moving into a giant concentration camp at the old airport getting
[02:10:49.640 --> 02:10:55.640]  partially free rent free vault cars with cameras in their homes watching them i just read that from
[02:10:55.640 --> 02:11:01.240]  mainstream news earlier we're entering a total twilight zone situation and he coined the gulag
[02:11:01.240 --> 02:11:06.360]  the casino gulag economy he said that like five years ago on our show now they pay you to play
[02:11:06.360 --> 02:11:12.680]  video games online but it's not really paying you i mean it is a hell world uh with cross species
[02:11:12.680 --> 02:11:20.520]  animals everywhere uh gmo exempt with diplomatic immunity forcing you to eat it the un murdering
[02:11:20.520 --> 02:11:26.120]  people everywhere for their land endless wars al-qaeda being hailed in the news as heroes in
[02:11:26.120 --> 02:11:32.040]  syria i mean we are entering an upside down crazy world by design where people just give
[02:11:32.040 --> 02:11:37.720]  into anything that's my rant max keiser breakdown those subjects what do you want to go through
[02:11:37.720 --> 02:11:43.160]  first uh what's happening with the global economy why are you saying we're inching towards a meltdown
[02:11:43.160 --> 02:11:47.880]  as the u.s military admits they're getting ready for martial law in october we're not saying that's
[02:11:47.880 --> 02:11:53.800]  going to happen we told you before it was in the news now it's admitted armored pillboxes automatic
[02:11:53.800 --> 02:12:00.600]  weapons 40 caliber bullets 450 million of them surveillance drones checkpoints uh what is happening
[02:12:00.600 --> 02:12:07.640]  max keiser yeah thanks for having me on i i think the reason i make that comment has to do with the
[02:12:07.640 --> 02:12:15.160]  live war scandal because the live war scandal is is a new level of scandal if you will uh first of
[02:12:15.160 --> 02:12:21.320]  all it works its way into the central banking system so we have the bank of england and the
[02:12:21.320 --> 02:12:27.320]  federal reserve bank are implicated in this live war scandal we haven't had the central banks caught
[02:12:27.320 --> 02:12:35.480]  red-handed manipulating markets like this really before and additionally the live war scandal itself
[02:12:35.480 --> 02:12:43.720]  is different because usually we have these instances where traders at banks are identified as rogue
[02:12:43.720 --> 02:12:51.800]  traders they commit what are called fact finger trades they lose billions of dollars and the bank
[02:12:51.800 --> 02:12:57.560]  always says well it's an isolated situation and they always they always commit suicide or a murder
[02:12:57.560 --> 02:13:03.880]  too and we've seen some of that happening last week sorry not not enough uh in in my opinion
[02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:12.040]  we need to see a lot more of that uh and a lot less passive resistance but uh to finish on this
[02:13:12.040 --> 02:13:19.240]  idea the the nature of the live war scandal itself by definition requires two or more parties
[02:13:19.240 --> 02:13:26.920]  at different banks working in collusion to manipulate interest rates so that definition
[02:13:26.920 --> 02:13:34.520]  is a um rego it's a syndicated for it's it would come under the auspices of being um prosecuted
[02:13:34.520 --> 02:13:41.720]  under racketeering it's a conspiracy it is it is by definition a conspiracy because the only way
[02:13:41.720 --> 02:13:47.080]  nobody doubts that this took place and if it did take place it could only happen if there was a
[02:13:47.080 --> 02:13:53.560]  conspiracy if there was a collusion amongst these bankers so this opens up an enormous amount you
[02:13:53.560 --> 02:13:59.160]  know some are calling it the banking industry tobacco moment because the live war rate is tied
[02:13:59.160 --> 02:14:06.680]  to over 500 trillion dollars in securities around the world and all of those people now have caused
[02:14:06.680 --> 02:14:13.320]  to sue the banks and the central banks and jimsy geithner and mervin king and everybody else involved
[02:14:13.320 --> 02:14:19.240]  and it's going to be an astronomically large sum of money that is going to fundamentally change
[02:14:19.240 --> 02:14:24.920]  the banks and what will happen alex is that the banks as they're being sued because of the live
[02:14:24.920 --> 02:14:30.840]  war scandal will have to disclose finally some transparency on their books so we'll find out
[02:14:30.840 --> 02:14:37.320]  that jp morgan is in fact insolvent by a factor of 10 times their current market capitalization
[02:14:37.320 --> 02:14:44.120]  society general on francism solvent bnp and francis insolvent doji bank which has a 60 to one
[02:14:44.120 --> 02:14:48.920]  lever done as balance sheet is insolvent by a factor of 20 or 30 times its current market
[02:14:48.920 --> 02:14:55.880]  capitalization and as this information filters its way through the system these banks will implode
[02:14:55.880 --> 02:15:02.440]  and this will be the really the the coup de grace of this huge scandal if you thought that the facebook
[02:15:02.440 --> 02:15:09.240]  ipo dropping 50 after two or three weeks which is something by the way i said on my show i said
[02:15:09.240 --> 02:15:15.880]  it was an absolute dead certainty but the facebook stock would drop by a minimum of 50 within three
[02:15:15.880 --> 02:15:22.600]  months of the ipo and that's exactly what happened because that is a hologram of fraud upon these
[02:15:22.600 --> 02:15:28.360]  game with no business model these banks let me stop you it's now come out that they've got bots
[02:15:28.360 --> 02:15:35.720]  80 percent overcharging the clicks i mean it's now come out that that nielsen is a fraud of course
[02:15:35.720 --> 02:15:43.160]  everything's a fraud it's all fraud well that's right bots are creating the illusion of commercial
[02:15:43.160 --> 02:15:48.520]  activity that means that the whole facebook business model is a fraud but these same bots
[02:15:49.160 --> 02:15:55.960]  are at work on the new york stock exchange just this morning alex we had a huge new york stock
[02:15:55.960 --> 02:16:02.680]  exchange flash crash and then recovery event tied to a company called knight rider who's a market
[02:16:02.680 --> 02:16:10.200]  maker and they now are involved in a massive investigation for algorithmic rigging of the
[02:16:10.200 --> 02:16:15.640]  stock market and they do this in order to squeeze a few pennies of profits out on top of the massive
[02:16:15.640 --> 02:16:20.920]  profits that you already make but they end up fundamentally putting at risk the structure of
[02:16:20.920 --> 02:16:26.840]  the exchange itself so it won't be long now before the exchange just collapses under the weight of its
[02:16:26.840 --> 02:16:32.920]  own algorithmic fraud and this of course sets in motion a chain reaction amongst other exchanges
[02:16:32.920 --> 02:16:39.400]  banks around the world so nobody has done anything remember the may of 2010 flash crash nobody did
[02:16:39.400 --> 02:16:44.360]  anything to any safeguards in place to stop the exact same thing from happening again and the
[02:16:44.360 --> 02:16:50.520]  derivatives have gotten worse all the insane and as things prepare to implode they only engage in
[02:16:50.520 --> 02:16:57.240]  more reckless stealing so we're talking about a biblical level collapse here well the derivative
[02:16:57.960 --> 02:17:02.840]  situation has gotten worse for two reasons number one the total amount of outstanding
[02:17:02.840 --> 02:17:09.560]  derivatives has gone up but the underlying economy that supports the derivatives has gotten smaller
[02:17:09.560 --> 02:17:16.600]  because the all of the 20 g donations around the world are in contraction if you want to really
[02:17:16.600 --> 02:17:22.120]  look at it with a gross domestic product number that adequately reflects true inflation numbers
[02:17:22.120 --> 02:17:28.200]  they're all in in contraction so the derivative problem is being magnified by the fact that not
[02:17:28.200 --> 02:17:34.200]  only are the number of contracts rising but the economic activity that is the underlying
[02:17:34.200 --> 02:17:40.040]  collateral for that activity is shrinking so you have the austerity measures in Europe the austerity
[02:17:40.040 --> 02:17:45.800]  measures in the UK are causing tax receipts to plummet which are causing the ability for
[02:17:45.800 --> 02:17:51.640]  government to fund itself to drop which means they go more into the derivative market to help
[02:17:51.640 --> 02:17:57.080]  fake their way through the crisis which of course creates this dynamic of rising
[02:17:57.080 --> 02:18:03.320]  fake derivative manipulated nonsense on top of an ever shrinking collateral pool those two things
[02:18:03.320 --> 02:18:09.000]  get to a point where they're completely unsustainable and the LIBOR scandal I believe will be the
[02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:15.560]  wedge that is the final wedge to create this cap that you drop like Iceland into the abyss
[02:18:15.560 --> 02:18:23.240]  of global currency collapse and Max Kaiser what is the time frame your best guess dead reckoning
[02:18:23.800 --> 02:18:29.800]  estimation on the LIBOR scandal destroying what confidence is left in the giant Ponzi scheme
[02:18:29.800 --> 02:18:39.480]  operation 20 minutes no I like it now it's Alex see the time is I would you know this is we're
[02:18:39.480 --> 02:18:45.320]  in now entering the second we're in the second half of 2012 the clearly what's happening in Europe
[02:18:45.320 --> 02:18:53.960]  is the the banks are incapable of stemming the tide of collapse that is now sweeping through
[02:18:53.960 --> 02:19:01.160]  the European banking some and their solution will be to create another 10 to 15 million euros in
[02:19:01.160 --> 02:19:11.560]  money printing to help bail out these banks that will probably be commensurate on the timing of
[02:19:11.560 --> 02:19:16.520]  this where you you know it's always difficult to make it you know a prediction on a timing but
[02:19:16.520 --> 02:19:23.080]  I've been pretty good in it on that in the past so I will say that within the next nine months
[02:19:23.080 --> 02:19:32.520]  we will have an event that will make 2000 or make collapse seem minor by comparison
[02:19:34.680 --> 02:19:39.000]  I want to come back and talk about how the establishment will respond what new power grab
[02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:44.920]  they're going to ask for to fix the crisis they created and I want to tie this into war I mean
[02:19:44.920 --> 02:19:49.000]  they're not going to implode something like this without having a big war to get us to all rally
[02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:55.320]  around the crooks someone to get max keiser's take on the iotola over an iran sing war in two weeks

[02:24:27.320 --> 02:24:35.880]  deadlines and commitments all right we are back live thank you so much for joining us
[02:24:37.240 --> 02:24:41.480]  the globalists are running against the wind of history that tyrants will fall
[02:24:41.480 --> 02:24:47.480]  they think all their high tech gadgetry is going to protect them they got another thing coming
[02:24:47.480 --> 02:24:52.280]  they've tried to wreck the us culture all they've done is wreck people they can wreck those of us
[02:24:52.280 --> 02:24:57.320]  that are resistant or immune to their brainwashing it's only served to aggravate us
[02:24:59.880 --> 02:25:04.920]  that which does not kill us only makes us stronger max keiser max keiser.com financial
[02:25:04.920 --> 02:25:12.120]  tv radio host former stockbroker financial expert so now suddenly it's not max keiser
[02:25:12.120 --> 02:25:17.080]  five years ago or alex jones or paul greg roberts or you know bob chatman or countless others
[02:25:17.080 --> 02:25:21.720]  breaking down what was coming the mathematical facts now it's larry summers all of them are like
[02:25:21.720 --> 02:25:26.280]  there's a total catastrophe coming the only answer is give us total power over your lives
[02:25:26.280 --> 02:25:31.160]  so now they've shifted from oh yeah we never really left the recession as if we need them to tell us
[02:25:31.160 --> 02:25:37.720]  that to total destruction except for advertisements they put on about how things are getting better
[02:25:37.720 --> 02:25:43.480]  invest in the stock market today what's being pumped up artificially by the plunge protection
[02:25:43.480 --> 02:25:49.320]  team so how do they plan on getting out of this without going to jail like bernie made off when
[02:25:49.320 --> 02:25:54.520]  they've committed crimes how much bigger are the top banks crimes in the aggregate compared to
[02:25:54.520 --> 02:26:01.000]  bernie made off what hundreds of times bigger max keiser yeah it's funny you say about putting
[02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:08.040]  these white collar criminals into prison and of course the prisons that america are privatized
[02:26:08.040 --> 02:26:13.800]  they're owned by private corporations and many of them while corrections court of america are listed
[02:26:13.800 --> 02:26:19.960]  on the stock exchange i can imagine alex if you put a group of stock brokers and brokers in one of
[02:26:19.960 --> 02:26:28.920]  these gels they will free themselves by organizing a leverage buyout of the jail uh taking the jail
[02:26:28.920 --> 02:26:35.480]  private uh releasing themselves and then selling the jail once again to the public and making profit
[02:26:35.480 --> 02:26:43.640]  in the spread in other words the economy is so infiltrated with financialized financialization
[02:26:43.640 --> 02:26:50.360]  and white collar crooks wall street cooks crooks and all the gdp all the activity is tied to trading
[02:26:50.360 --> 02:26:55.080]  in some way and all the trading is totally corrupt you can't really take the corruption out of the
[02:26:55.080 --> 02:27:00.440]  system at this point because there's really nothing else but corruption so it's like car
[02:27:00.440 --> 02:27:06.520]  that is 80 percent rusted out if you took the rust away there would be no car at all if you took
[02:27:06.520 --> 02:27:11.160]  corruption away financial wall street corruption away from the american and the british economy
[02:27:11.160 --> 02:27:17.640]  there would be literally nothing left so these guys have figured out a way to imbue themselves into
[02:27:17.640 --> 02:27:25.800]  the system to put to uh really attack themselves to the system like a parasite and and they are
[02:27:25.800 --> 02:27:31.480]  really hardwired into the system i thought might be what might be interesting alps is that a lot
[02:27:31.480 --> 02:27:36.040]  of people are curious about market manipulation you know we've been talking about on your show for
[02:27:36.040 --> 02:27:42.520]  years and uh now that under people understand that these markets are being manipulated it might be
[02:27:42.520 --> 02:27:46.760]  interesting for people to understand a little bit more about how to actually manipulate the price on
[02:27:46.760 --> 02:27:51.240]  one of these exchanges because i used to do it myself when i was working on wall street and this
[02:27:51.240 --> 02:27:55.480]  it's the same technique except now they use high-frequency trading and algorithmic trading but
[02:27:55.480 --> 02:28:01.240]  the technique is basically the same and it involves what are called wash trades and the way this
[02:28:01.240 --> 02:28:06.600]  works out is that if a stock is trading at $100 a share and you're trying to manipulate the price
[02:28:06.600 --> 02:28:14.680]  to 101 or 102 you simultaneously put on a buy and sell order at 101 or 102 so the ticker
[02:28:14.680 --> 02:28:20.120]  tape when it goes across it'll show a transaction at that higher price but that transaction actually
[02:28:20.120 --> 02:28:25.400]  didn't cost or anything because it was simultaneously buy and sell was a wash trade this is
[02:28:25.400 --> 02:28:31.960]  illegal but it's done now with high-frequency trading and algorithm trading billions of times a day
[02:28:32.600 --> 02:28:37.080]  this morning the fraud on the New York Stock Exchange involved hundreds of millions of
[02:28:37.080 --> 02:28:42.280]  transactions in the space of less than an hour so there's no way to actually the authorities
[02:28:42.280 --> 02:28:47.960]  to step in there and to stop it because the high frequency traders alps believe it or not
[02:28:47.960 --> 02:28:54.600]  they're only they're only constrained with their computer technology by the speed of light that's
[02:28:54.600 --> 02:29:01.640]  how fast these traders are going now they are doing trades in billions of a second and so obviously
[02:29:01.640 --> 02:29:05.880]  as a law enforcement can't possibly keep up with this but essentially that's the way we manipulate
[02:29:05.880 --> 02:29:11.080]  prices up or down now if you have a stock like IBM and you are manipulating the price let's say from
[02:29:11.080 --> 02:29:17.480]  100 to 101 102 and if you simultaneously put an option trade on one of the various options
[02:29:17.480 --> 02:29:21.720]  exchanges knowing that there's going to be a price differential coming either up or down
[02:29:21.720 --> 02:29:26.280]  you simply put on that trade on the New York Stock Exchange move the price up or down by a few
[02:29:26.280 --> 02:29:31.400]  percentage points and immediately book your profits in the option market and this is what we
[02:29:31.400 --> 02:29:38.360]  did all this time on Wall Street and very variations on this theme but it's very rare to find trading
[02:29:38.360 --> 02:29:42.680]  these days that is just people coming together and buying and selling in a traditional basket
[02:29:42.680 --> 02:29:48.360]  exactly it's all a giant matrix like fraud absorbing the real world and the bankers are so hungry
[02:29:48.360 --> 02:29:55.400]  they're now taking houses they don't even own we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and

[02:32:13.320 --> 02:32:18.760]  your electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name
[02:32:18.760 --> 02:32:24.120]  of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[02:32:24.120 --> 02:32:29.320]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[02:32:29.320 --> 02:32:34.520]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families
[02:32:34.520 --> 02:32:39.080]  lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[02:32:39.080 --> 02:32:43.640]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators

[02:33:22.040 --> 02:33:29.640]  max keiser of max keiser dot com is our guest i'm alex jones and this isn't a game i could sit
[02:33:29.640 --> 02:33:34.760]  here and uh go over a hundred different articles where different world leaders a lot of them who
[02:33:34.760 --> 02:33:41.640]  were involved in this premeditated criminal takeover of the real economy by the fraudsters
[02:33:42.680 --> 02:33:46.520]  but you've i mean you've seen the quotes out there you you've heard us cover the news
[02:33:47.880 --> 02:33:54.120]  my question is they're clearly gearing up for a bunch of new wars the iatola over in iran is saying
[02:33:54.120 --> 02:33:58.200]  brace for war the next two weeks i don't know if that's the case but these are going from war
[02:33:58.200 --> 02:34:03.400]  drums to al-qaeda proxy armies attacking i want to get into all of that with max keiser but let's
[02:34:03.400 --> 02:34:08.120]  go over a bunch of financial issues here after we finish up on this question because i want to get
[02:34:08.120 --> 02:34:13.560]  into hsbc and the drug running and the al-qaeda i mean that's all over the news the the just all of
[02:34:13.560 --> 02:34:20.360]  it it's it's that's the thing about corruption folks is they always push the envelope and it
[02:34:20.360 --> 02:34:26.200]  automatically will then sink to the most horrible thing you can imagine just like all over the us
[02:34:26.200 --> 02:34:29.640]  they're saying you can't have water fall in your own garden now we're going to arrest you 30 days
[02:34:29.640 --> 02:34:35.960]  in jail that was in the news this week all over they're taking houses that are totally paid for
[02:34:35.960 --> 02:34:42.520]  i mean forget just triple selling the deed they don't care of confidence is destroyed they're
[02:34:42.520 --> 02:34:48.520]  converting it to prisons and checkpoints and if you're in the in crowd your house doesn't get taken
[02:34:48.520 --> 02:34:54.200]  or you're allowed to travel i mean they really want a 1984 world where these globalists are
[02:34:54.200 --> 02:34:59.720]  offshore their tax exempt they've written the laws they pay little or no taxes and they can
[02:34:59.720 --> 02:35:11.080]  just get away with anything the problem is in the bravada tuberous hood spa fueled madness of
[02:35:11.080 --> 02:35:17.640]  these people they're trying to start wars now with russia who's wildly corrupt and has his own
[02:35:17.640 --> 02:35:27.320]  problems but is is is not you know this brand of insanity and of course they're infiltrated as well
[02:35:27.320 --> 02:35:33.640]  this is a scientific fraudulent takeover that max was talking about where they have created over a
[02:35:33.640 --> 02:35:38.600]  thousand trillion of garbage gotten governments to sign on to it and they lecture us all day that
[02:35:38.600 --> 02:35:44.200]  it's our taxes have to pay this off and then they raise the taxes knowing good and well it's going
[02:35:44.200 --> 02:35:49.560]  to implode the economy and actually lower tax receipts which makes government then fall apart
[02:35:49.560 --> 02:35:56.360]  and then become more predatory i mean it is a hellish plan max how does war fit into this
[02:35:56.360 --> 02:36:01.160]  because clearly they want to launch the next big implosion during a war because they think
[02:36:01.160 --> 02:36:05.640]  people will rally around them then they can have their buddies al-qaeda stage an attack or take
[02:36:05.640 --> 02:36:10.120]  the blame for an attack and then really come after the people of europe and the united states
[02:36:10.120 --> 02:36:14.840]  as freedoms they got the military ready for marshal law that's now admitted secretary of the army
[02:36:14.840 --> 02:36:19.800]  says they want to put trips in every city it's starting i mean this is a takeover we we are
[02:36:19.800 --> 02:36:26.120]  being captured by the bankers who brag about it so so how will they try to complete this takeover
[02:36:26.120 --> 02:36:35.880]  and is there any way to stop them war has always been a handy profit-making enterprise
[02:36:35.880 --> 02:36:44.760]  for entrenched kleptocrats what's interesting that the us is not waging war abroad they're waging
[02:36:44.760 --> 02:36:52.440]  war domestically against against itself so this is tyranny so this is the definition of tyranny
[02:36:52.440 --> 02:36:58.120]  when the government wages war against itself that's tyrannical and this is what the u.s
[02:36:58.120 --> 02:37:05.560]  government is doing by stripping away all of these civil rights after 911 they opened the flood gate
[02:37:05.560 --> 02:37:13.960]  to the worst elements of government who are now in charge and attacking itself and this is type
[02:37:13.960 --> 02:37:20.600]  this is tyrannical and they're doing so without any uh conscious adherence to any known democrat
[02:37:20.600 --> 02:37:26.440]  principle constitutional principle or economic principle is economic suicide it's constitutional
[02:37:26.440 --> 02:37:34.280]  suicide and so the war is as you say i guess sometimes in 360 full spectrum you know the war
[02:37:34.280 --> 02:37:42.280]  is both the america fighting itself but a war against itself as an attempt to stop at its own
[02:37:42.280 --> 02:37:47.560]  democratic institutions as well as fighting wars abroad fighting wars all over all over the world
[02:37:47.560 --> 02:37:53.640]  so clearly that's unsustainable ideologically and economically max give me a favor tip your
[02:37:53.640 --> 02:37:57.880]  camera down for people watching at prisonplanet.tv thank you sir because we want to get a good look
[02:37:57.880 --> 02:38:06.040]  at you there so we can put your bio and a name under you there max keiser.com uh max well i mean
[02:38:06.040 --> 02:38:12.680]  it's the bankers using the u.s as their giant attack goblin but debilitating us at the same time
[02:38:12.680 --> 02:38:16.520]  what is their out strategy and i see all these big billionaires that made their money off
[02:38:16.520 --> 02:38:22.200]  fraud off manipulating markets and government contracts they're all buying armored keeps
[02:38:22.200 --> 02:38:28.920]  uh in in different you know uh rural areas of the world with private security details i mean why
[02:38:28.920 --> 02:38:34.280]  would they want to do something like this i mean you've described it you you call it suicide
[02:38:34.840 --> 02:38:40.600]  bankers right i mean it's it's just crazy well it's not like the bankers are hurting at the
[02:38:40.600 --> 02:38:46.440]  moment they're they're making record profits and if you look at the prices of things that the bankers
[02:38:46.440 --> 02:38:53.400]  are buying the prices are going up i just saw a listing in new york city for a three or four floor
[02:38:53.400 --> 02:39:01.560]  apartment that is selling for 100 million dollars that is one apartment on sale 100 million dollars
[02:39:01.560 --> 02:39:07.720]  and if you go to cities around the world london in particular new york paris uh moscow you find
[02:39:07.720 --> 02:39:13.480]  that unbelievable wealth is putting money into apartments they're putting money into art you
[02:39:13.480 --> 02:39:18.280]  know the art market the high end of the art market is continuing to see higher and higher bids
[02:39:18.280 --> 02:39:24.360]  uh precious metals precious jewels so they're getting fabulously rich what i see here is a
[02:39:24.360 --> 02:39:32.680]  conflict between a majority and medievalism and what i mean by that is that in order to keep
[02:39:32.680 --> 02:39:39.800]  the population in line the government is returning to pre-independent medieval
[02:39:39.800 --> 02:39:49.480]  um society where knowledge is kept hidden or monopolized by a feeder and i saw something
[02:39:49.480 --> 02:39:54.440]  today out which is a perfect example of this there's a new hedge fund launching on wall street
[02:39:54.440 --> 02:40:01.320]  that is going to be based entirely on superstition so the hedge fund it has algorithms and pots
[02:40:01.320 --> 02:40:07.560]  that go into the market and make trades avoiding like number 13 avoiding the mention of black cat
[02:40:07.560 --> 02:40:13.560]  uh and and they amass all of the superstitions from around the world and then they have algorithms
[02:40:13.560 --> 02:40:19.640]  that try to trade around those superstitions so what the elite are doing they're trying to
[02:40:19.640 --> 02:40:27.720]  capitalize on this return to a superstitious belief system in society that has completely
[02:40:27.720 --> 02:40:32.120]  walked away from the age of enlightenment well that's right let me stop you right there that
[02:40:32.120 --> 02:40:38.920]  is absolutely key they they've even admitted in documentaries about mtv they are trying to dumb
[02:40:38.920 --> 02:40:45.400]  it down that's why you watch things now and it's something that a mentally retarded child would
[02:40:45.400 --> 02:40:52.120]  like and and this is done by design it's it's so horrible i lived in a in a flat in paris
[02:40:52.680 --> 02:40:58.280]  two years ago which is where denis dito roe lived when he was here living in paris during the
[02:40:58.280 --> 02:41:04.120]  enlightenment and he's famous for creating the first encyclopedia and of course part of the
[02:41:04.120 --> 02:41:09.480]  enlightenment was to take the knowledge from the church and put it into the hands of the people
[02:41:09.480 --> 02:41:15.480]  now we have the reverse we have the knowledge of how to trade derivatives with a hedge fund
[02:41:15.480 --> 02:41:22.200]  that's got an algorithm searching for superstitions that information is held behind a very high gate
[02:41:22.200 --> 02:41:28.920]  that is completely inaccessible by the masses while it while it scoops up billions and billions
[02:41:28.920 --> 02:41:34.360]  of dollars from these markets in a way that's completely against any known economic principle
[02:41:34.360 --> 02:41:41.880]  other than medieval feudalism and this is why these guys continue to get rich the peasant class
[02:41:41.880 --> 02:41:49.880]  which is us which is you which is me who are being abused by this new monarchy and aristocracy
[02:41:49.880 --> 02:41:56.520]  are being deprived of our access to meaningful information we have through the internet
[02:41:56.520 --> 02:42:01.400]  access to an incredible array of information but we do not have access to the algorithms
[02:42:01.400 --> 02:42:07.080]  that you can let lead loose into the stock market to do automatically create arbitrage
[02:42:07.080 --> 02:42:12.040]  suspicions or high-frequency trading that is in effect just taking or stealing money out of the
[02:42:12.040 --> 02:42:20.120]  market the Goldman Sachs high-frequency trading bot steals 100 million dollars every single day
[02:42:20.120 --> 02:42:25.640]  they have a computer that's parked right next to the new york stock exchange they call co-location
[02:42:25.640 --> 02:42:32.600]  it's there to run trades and to siphon off money if i put a tube in your neighbor's car and i siphon
[02:42:32.600 --> 02:42:37.720]  gas from your neighbor's car that's stealing and yet Goldman Sachs says they siphon cash from the
[02:42:37.720 --> 02:42:43.560]  new york stock exchange and their defense is that they're making a market or they're adding liquidity
[02:42:43.560 --> 02:42:52.040]  that's complete rubbish it's just pure theft now max again it's been ruled this is illegal but they
[02:42:52.040 --> 02:42:57.000]  have the regulators in every position now i want to move quickly before we take some calls here
[02:42:57.000 --> 02:43:03.640]  monsanto as you know has a bill introduced as a rider looks like it may pass to allow them to just
[02:43:03.640 --> 02:43:08.600]  get everything approved without approval even of their own scientists and and and lawyers they've
[02:43:08.600 --> 02:43:14.120]  put in at the FDA and to give them liability protection where they can do anything they want
[02:43:14.120 --> 02:43:19.800]  i mean now it's reaching you know a literal godlike behavior by these people separately
[02:43:20.520 --> 02:43:27.000]  we've got them talking about qe3 let's get into the bankers wanting to sell carbon credits
[02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:33.160]  i saw this a few months ago they're about to get global diplomatic community when they sell carbon
[02:43:33.160 --> 02:43:39.640]  credits i mean they are making themselves under this global government absolutely exempt from
[02:43:39.640 --> 02:43:46.760]  their laws but then they put laws on us saying we have absolutely no rights under slaves i mean it
[02:43:46.760 --> 02:43:52.600]  it's got to come to a head and their answer is militarize the police and have a bunch of drones
[02:43:52.600 --> 02:44:01.400]  attack us well let's talk about the monsanto issue first the monsanto is particularly heinous
[02:44:01.400 --> 02:44:07.480]  corporation in that they sell these exterminator seeds these are seeds that don't reproduce so
[02:44:07.480 --> 02:44:12.920]  they have to be purchased every single year so you're basically putting a a boot on the throat
[02:44:12.920 --> 02:44:19.000]  of god and saying you can't read these seeds don't reproduce only monsanto can reproduce
[02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:24.360]  furthermore they sell fertilizer that only works with those seeds again the costs are
[02:44:24.360 --> 02:44:31.320]  astronomical that's why something like 2000 indians in in india are committing suicide i think it's on
[02:44:31.320 --> 02:44:38.040]  a weekly basis or a monthly basis could even be on a daily basis because they drink them on
[02:44:38.040 --> 02:44:46.600]  santo poison uh to to off themselves yes right uh so now this is happening and and and of course
[02:44:46.600 --> 02:44:50.840]  if these seeds are and this is happening in canada and now it's happening in the united states
[02:44:50.840 --> 02:44:59.880]  the seeds are blown by the wind in the else's farm and then they sprout unknown to that farmer
[02:44:59.880 --> 02:45:04.520]  but monsanto lawyers show up and say we're going to sue you or arrest you for a patent
[02:45:06.440 --> 02:45:10.440]  entombment no idea that the wind blew these seeds into their farm and yet they have the
[02:45:10.440 --> 02:45:17.240]  temerity to say you are committing patent theft and so they take these people to court and then
[02:45:17.240 --> 02:45:21.960]  of course they can't have the wherewithal and the money is to to go against monsanto and monsanto
[02:45:21.960 --> 02:45:28.040]  just keeps winning these lawsuits and is similar to we saw something in bolivia where the people
[02:45:28.040 --> 02:45:33.080]  did not have access to rainwater then they sued bechtel the corporation that was imposing this
[02:45:33.080 --> 02:45:37.000]  and they won so where did bechtel these other people come they come to america right there in
[02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:42.440]  texas you don't have access to your own right right bechtel comes in buys up reservoirs they're
[02:45:42.440 --> 02:45:47.160]  paid for by the citizens doubles triples the prices and they call that privatization
[02:45:47.160 --> 02:45:52.280]  no it's called robbery and and and now they're securitizing and leveraging the water
[02:45:53.240 --> 02:45:57.240]  and to drive the price up and now that's why they're announcing all over the us
[02:45:57.880 --> 02:46:02.920]  you're not allowed to have rainwater on your own yard now you're going to pay a tax for that
[02:46:02.920 --> 02:46:09.640]  and they're going around arresting people with rainwater collection tanks right now on the carbon
[02:46:09.640 --> 02:46:19.640]  first of all when you look at these things in total you you come to the conclusion that all of this
[02:46:20.360 --> 02:46:24.520]  lawyering around the world with the banking institutions around the world this is really
[02:46:24.520 --> 02:46:30.760]  a global a global group of people i mean this idea that you have a new world order which five
[02:46:30.760 --> 02:46:37.800]  years ago a lot of people were not willing to see how the united states could be gobbled up or
[02:46:37.800 --> 02:46:43.720]  subsumed by a global click of lawyers and bankers it seemed far-fetched and yet here you have
[02:46:43.720 --> 02:46:50.040]  corporations like monsanto which are attacking americans with the help of a global click of
[02:46:50.040 --> 02:46:54.120]  laws and bankers that is a new world order if you want to put in those terms that's exactly what
[02:46:54.120 --> 02:47:01.880]  that is and we we have no way to to of redress who do you go after exactly because this is now a
[02:47:01.880 --> 02:47:08.520]  global court and a global bank that answers only to itself that it completely supersedes the
[02:47:08.520 --> 02:47:13.160]  constitution it's just like in greece when greece started to get into trouble the government signed
[02:47:13.160 --> 02:47:19.480]  what was called the memorandum which gave the troika which is the imf eu and htp power over the
[02:47:19.480 --> 02:47:25.080]  country's constitution so therefore at that moment and in that memorandum the country of greece also
[02:47:25.080 --> 02:47:30.360]  signed away the rights to all of their country's assets and this is all that's going on there
[02:47:30.360 --> 02:47:36.120]  these outside forces are bankrupting greece take the income producing assets the roads the tolls
[02:47:36.120 --> 02:47:42.520]  the lottery and they're doing so for virtually no money because they are killing the country and
[02:47:42.520 --> 02:47:48.520]  then they install whoever they want and and brag that the bankers are installing the leaders in
[02:47:48.520 --> 02:47:54.440]  italy and greece and ireland and everywhere i mean it's incredible so so is the sky the limit i mean
[02:47:54.440 --> 02:47:59.080]  they're just god because they're fraudulent crooks and and by the way they're eugenicists
[02:47:59.080 --> 02:48:02.840]  that's what the bankers are into is killing us i guess ever they've stolen everything they plan
[02:48:02.840 --> 02:48:07.400]  to kill us with a bio weapon release these are really nice people well here's my here's what i
[02:48:07.400 --> 02:48:15.240]  would ask you if here's my answer alice you say how far can it go how far will these global
[02:48:15.240 --> 02:48:25.080]  banking crooks go i would ask you this question how low can we go how low how how much pain are we
[02:48:25.080 --> 02:48:32.040]  going to take before something snaps that's the question because they're never going to stop
[02:48:32.840 --> 02:48:41.480]  they're programmed to take all the money just like cancer is programmed to take it all so that's
[02:48:41.480 --> 02:48:46.920]  not the question we know the answer what they intend to do they intend to create a global
[02:48:46.920 --> 02:48:54.040]  peasantry when they are the aristocrats they want to go back to the 16th century the 15th century
[02:48:54.040 --> 02:48:59.400]  the 14th century so that's not the question the question is not how high will they go how low
[02:49:00.040 --> 02:49:05.400]  are we going to go how far down are we willing to go that's the question and i don't know the
[02:49:05.400 --> 02:49:11.000]  answer to that because i don't see any evidence right now that people have decided that they
[02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:16.280]  enough is enough i'll tell you why max i'll tell you why max you're got a high IQ you know people
[02:49:16.280 --> 02:49:20.520]  out there that have been successful type a personalities don't want to be pushed around
[02:49:20.520 --> 02:49:25.320]  the average person even if they're somewhat smart is passive and thinks everybody's like them so
[02:49:25.320 --> 02:49:29.480]  they're just trying to be helpful and friendly and because the globalists wear suits and ties
[02:49:29.480 --> 02:49:35.000]  every you know they must be nice men just like why women got the car with ted bundy and so you
[02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:41.080]  have to understand a lot of people are physically in a trance they watch tv all day they think of
[02:49:41.080 --> 02:49:46.040]  themselves as these passive creatures that just kind of go through life but what the globalists
[02:49:46.040 --> 02:49:50.360]  have to understand is not all of us are like that and that's why they think they're going to use the
[02:49:50.360 --> 02:49:54.680]  military and the police but i got news for them you know for the globalists the military police
[02:49:54.680 --> 02:50:00.200]  worldwide are waking up you've seen it in europe and i think it's going to end up with the globalist
[02:50:00.200 --> 02:50:05.320]  getting getting put in prison the problem is like you said the structure is now in place
[02:50:05.320 --> 02:50:11.640]  so we'll probably just trade out this group for another group i think as a as a culture we have
[02:50:11.640 --> 02:50:17.640]  cancer and as you just said it's programmed to take it all and god help us that's all i can say god
[02:50:17.640 --> 02:50:24.680]  help us well i'll give you a movie reference which is interesting it's very haunting i don't know if
[02:50:24.680 --> 02:50:32.440]  you ever saw that movie the green mile with tom hanks and there's a character named his last name
[02:50:32.440 --> 02:50:39.880]  is coffee john coffee it's kind of a you know jc jesus christ type character yeah that's that's the
[02:50:39.880 --> 02:50:46.920]  big nfl player i met him in a ufc fight big big black guy with a cool voice big big big black guy
[02:50:46.920 --> 02:50:52.680]  and he's in this movie and they're in jail and tom acts is talking to him and he's saying well
[02:50:53.320 --> 02:50:59.240]  the the the guy who committed the murder the real murderer how did he get away with it and this
[02:50:59.240 --> 02:51:05.000]  john coffee character explains that it was love that killed the little girl and the way he explained
[02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:11.720]  it is that the murderer set up two sisters and he killed one of the sisters and he told the other
[02:51:11.720 --> 02:51:20.280]  sister that if you loved your sister you would never tell on him so he used the idea of love
[02:51:20.280 --> 02:51:25.160]  to keep by her silence now i may be missing getting this plot a little mixed up but that's the
[02:51:25.160 --> 02:51:32.760]  essence of the idea is that love in the wrong hand by by a pathologically sick person it can be used
[02:51:32.760 --> 02:51:39.000]  as a as a disguise to fool people into trusting them into fool people into thinking that they
[02:51:39.000 --> 02:51:45.000]  have a message that they need to respect the love can be very used in this way no no no that's what
[02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:49.160]  the tyrants do it's all about how they love us and they're going to take the guns and they're
[02:51:49.160 --> 02:51:53.960]  going to take our property and they're going to brainwash us because they love us right that's
[02:51:53.960 --> 02:51:58.840]  that's the message they they have a message of love and peace and understanding while they're
[02:51:58.840 --> 02:52:05.000]  putting us in prison stealing our wealth and destroy our economy and but people respond to love
[02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:10.520]  the same way people respond to sugar it's it's hard coded in our being so we we tend to believe it
[02:52:10.520 --> 02:52:15.800]  when somebody says i love you we our instincts are to believe them and in that moment that
[02:52:15.800 --> 02:52:21.400]  fraction of an instant is when you lose your money you lose your economy and you lose your country
[02:52:22.920 --> 02:52:26.840]  yeah because a bunch of people are posing like liberals and conservatives when they're all part
[02:52:26.840 --> 02:52:32.760]  of a criminal criminal group who who you know i was talking to the goldman sacks former top
[02:52:32.760 --> 02:52:38.040]  executive who who who made this documentary a greater good about vaccines killing people
[02:52:38.040 --> 02:52:42.360]  now the documents have come out they know they don't help you they hurt you it's actually spreading
[02:52:42.360 --> 02:52:49.320]  the disease and she said she had a she was golden sacks exact managing director and she had uh
[02:52:50.200 --> 02:52:57.160]  this golden sacks uh well of this a big pharma guy in the meeting with her and she said i'm
[02:52:57.160 --> 02:53:00.920]  going to make seven million this year killing people and he thought she was part of the club
[02:53:00.920 --> 02:53:04.920]  that's when she woke up he was telling her how much fun it was to kill people with the vaccines
[02:53:05.560 --> 02:53:10.120]  and that's the crazy thing about these people a lot of them it's not just about power and
[02:53:10.120 --> 02:53:14.760]  stealing and being dominant they really like killing people they love the idea as the head of
[02:53:14.760 --> 02:53:19.000]  a big company that they're going to kill millions of people and that the hospitals are going to
[02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:24.360]  cover it up i mean and it's like a really big rush for them uh the big new brzezinski writes
[02:53:24.360 --> 02:53:29.720]  books and rags about how he triggered a group to kill millions and how cool it is you know that he
[02:53:29.720 --> 02:53:34.120]  helped put pole pod in who killed 30 of his population and when he goes and gives a speech the
[02:53:34.120 --> 02:53:39.720]  globalist are in awe of him it's like my god he killed a lot of people he's really tough i mean
[02:53:39.720 --> 02:53:47.080]  these these are demons well once you scapegoat a part of the population then they're marked for
[02:53:47.080 --> 02:53:53.880]  death so in america the poor have been scapegoated i mean during world war two obviously ethnic
[02:53:53.880 --> 02:53:58.840]  groups were scapegoated they were vilified and they were slaughtered in america the scapegoating
[02:53:58.840 --> 02:54:05.240]  goes on in terms of the poor people poor people are considered to be socially misfits and that
[02:54:05.240 --> 02:54:09.560]  they are basically being targeted and all the rhetoric out there like a mit romney character
[02:54:09.560 --> 02:54:15.560]  for example seems to put over this idea like he just said for example alice i can ask you this
[02:54:15.560 --> 02:54:23.320]  question he said talking about israel and palestine that israel was more successful than palestine
[02:54:23.320 --> 02:54:29.640]  because they were culturally superior how is that different than the same genesis message of hitler
[02:54:29.640 --> 02:54:39.560]  in the 30s and 40s now we see this we see this more and more and look we have become a very
[02:54:39.560 --> 02:54:45.000]  very dark culture and we've even those of us that don't like it have just become accustomed to it
[02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:48.360]  because when you dance with the devil he doesn't change he changes you i want to go to some calls
[02:54:48.360 --> 02:54:52.760]  but they're getting ready for all these big wars let me ask you this i want to do one more
[02:54:52.760 --> 02:54:57.080]  segment after this i want to go to calls right now what do you make of the fact that yeah i mean a
[02:54:57.080 --> 02:55:01.560]  year ago it was in a few newspapers that the west was putting al qaeda in libya now it's all over the
[02:55:01.560 --> 02:55:07.000]  news and the london guardians like well al qaeda's got good discipline they're i mean they're actually
[02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:12.920]  saying al qaeda are good guys and work for the west but then i need to give my ride step because
[02:55:12.920 --> 02:55:19.320]  al qaeda is hiding under the table well i saw something today that made me laugh you know
[02:55:19.320 --> 02:55:25.320]  vladimir putin came out with a big statement today and said that he believes that nato should
[02:55:25.320 --> 02:55:31.080]  stay in afghanistan until the job is done and think about that's such a beautiful statement
[02:55:31.080 --> 02:55:36.440]  because of course that's where russia the soviet union basically died in afghanistan it's where
[02:55:36.440 --> 02:55:44.360]  empires go to die and so the us is embroiled in this midi's conflagration that looks like it's
[02:55:44.360 --> 02:55:50.280]  going to end up in the death of the us umpire as well and so there is vladimir putin basically
[02:55:50.280 --> 02:55:57.720]  just smiling and saying yes you know go forward america stay they should stay in afghanistan
[02:55:57.720 --> 02:56:03.320]  and of course al qaeda was working for us back then then they switched sides now they're working
[02:56:03.320 --> 02:56:08.040]  for us again on our side but they go back and forth they were with us they were against us
[02:56:08.040 --> 02:56:13.160]  that they were with us and also you mentioned us at hspc earlier out now it's come out in the last
[02:56:13.160 --> 02:56:19.400]  week again to follow up the story you've been covering for 10 years on 9 11 it now has come out
[02:56:19.400 --> 02:56:26.360]  that hspc funded the 9 11 terrorists if you if you connect all the dots money that they were
[02:56:26.360 --> 02:56:31.720]  laundering for terrorists they said that's now a headline in major newspapers all over the world
[02:56:31.720 --> 02:56:36.680]  extends back 10 years so now we know where the funding came from the half a million dollars needed
[02:56:36.680 --> 02:56:41.160]  to do the 9 11 attacks that came in part from hspc and again it's not just funding it they're
[02:56:41.160 --> 02:56:46.440]  running it it's like wells fargo running the aircraft for the sinaloa group i mean this is who
[02:56:46.440 --> 02:56:50.760]  they are that they they run it they are the organized crime and they're going to take everything
[02:56:50.760 --> 02:56:54.680]  we've got and they've got the police training right now to kill us and we better reach out to the
[02:56:54.680 --> 02:56:59.400]  police now and wake them up let's go to scott nidaho you're on the air with max keiser go ahead
[02:57:00.200 --> 02:57:05.960]  hi alex hi max thank you both for your efforts in the battle for liberty and the cause of freedom
[02:57:05.960 --> 02:57:12.360]  i have a very brief comment and a question uh for max and or yourself okay my comment is
[02:57:12.360 --> 02:57:17.400]  what i think i hear you saying alex is that we're fast approaching the stage of the ultimate
[02:57:17.400 --> 02:57:22.680]  inversion the stage where the government is free to do anything it pleases while the citizens
[02:57:22.680 --> 02:57:28.920]  can act only by permission which is the stage of the darkest periods of human history the stage
[02:57:28.920 --> 02:57:36.280]  of rule by brute force my question is alex and or and max is it's been my experience over the past
[02:57:36.280 --> 02:57:43.160]  few decades that shortly after waking up many people experience bouts of depression due to the
[02:57:43.160 --> 02:57:49.560]  paradigm shift uh the new reality the new and true reality what advice can you give people
[02:57:49.560 --> 02:57:54.760]  listening to deal with this i would say fight fight the info or get aggressive don't and you're
[02:57:54.760 --> 02:58:00.360]  depressed if you're doing nothing you're you're going to be exhilarated and become more vicious
[02:58:00.360 --> 02:58:06.680]  with the truth as you fight as you as you take scalps of enemies as you crush the enemy who
[02:58:06.680 --> 02:58:12.680]  needs to be driven out max keiser that's a real it's a real good question because you know you
[02:58:12.680 --> 02:58:19.640]  have to weigh the pros and cons of being awake and maybe suffering the what happened the reality
[02:58:19.640 --> 02:58:23.800]  of being awake or you know it's like that scene in the matrix where he decides to go back into the
[02:58:23.800 --> 02:58:29.720]  matrix this steak tastes great uh i don't care that i'm a slave living in the matrix i love the
[02:58:29.720 --> 02:58:34.120]  taste of this steak and he stays he wants to go back into the matrix it's a very profound moment

[03:01:13.240 --> 03:01:19.160]  for holding welcome thanks for taking my call i have a specific question about the economy or
[03:01:19.160 --> 03:01:25.960]  rather some strategy but to speak to what that last caller said if i can't permit i think the i
[03:01:25.960 --> 03:01:30.360]  think what people have trouble with in confronting all this stuff about the matrix in the new world
[03:01:30.360 --> 03:01:36.280]  order is that they also have to confront the fact that they were living in that fall system and that
[03:01:36.280 --> 03:01:41.720]  they were fooled by it and and maybe it's an embarrassment or it's just hard to even fathom
[03:01:41.720 --> 03:01:47.720]  or it's also hard to fathom where uh all this could take us and they get a little scared by it and
[03:01:47.720 --> 03:01:53.000]  you know back down and i think that people just need to you know find some some way to focus
[03:01:53.000 --> 03:01:58.600]  that energy and improve themselves maybe yeah i know this new world order road leads to death
[03:01:58.600 --> 03:02:02.520]  okay that's the global stone statements we've listed it all here you have a quick question for max
[03:02:02.520 --> 03:02:09.000]  keiser yeah you know i i study the economy and you know my site talks about this a lot on twitter
[03:02:09.000 --> 03:02:14.280]  that you know the perception that uh the the market is kind of like the the large populist
[03:02:14.280 --> 03:02:18.920]  in the sense that they they don't seem to grasp the fact that economic collapse could actually
[03:02:18.920 --> 03:02:23.720]  happen you know that all all these signs that are happening now the uh the the purchase route
[03:02:23.720 --> 03:02:29.080]  the the uh the pmi indexes are crashing around the world the you know uk is going into recessional
[03:02:29.080 --> 03:02:34.040]  all that stuff it it just it doesn't phase them and and the behavior no i hear you i got it i got
[03:02:34.040 --> 03:02:37.320]  to jump because we're out of time i don't i'm not exactly sure what the question there is
[03:02:37.320 --> 03:02:44.440]  is more of a more of a statement look folks they're already in even like the london telegraph which
[03:02:44.440 --> 03:02:49.160]  is normally pro banker shang is it time to start arresting bankers the good news is we're getting
[03:02:49.160 --> 03:02:55.400]  past their puppets obama romney you know cameron to the actual globalist and the globalists are
[03:02:55.400 --> 03:02:59.160]  saying that i mean they're not invincible max i mean i i think we're going to end up seeing a
[03:02:59.160 --> 03:03:05.000]  lot of these folks go to prison i i think humanity's going to wake up well the um they're pushing
[03:03:05.000 --> 03:03:10.680]  their luck you know there was a report that came out today about this uh hedge fund management
[03:03:10.680 --> 03:03:15.400]  saying that he's genuinely concerned that a populist uprising will come and attack him but he feels
[03:03:15.400 --> 03:03:20.600]  very vulnerable out there in the hamptons on long island which is an enclave of many many rich people
[03:03:20.600 --> 03:03:25.720]  and i think the this top group of club two crassies bankers are beginning to realize that they are
[03:03:25.720 --> 03:03:31.800]  very vulnerable it's really not that difficult to get to them and as more and more people understand
[03:03:31.800 --> 03:03:36.920]  the nature of the crimes they're going to be motivated to go after them now the question is
[03:03:36.920 --> 03:03:41.800]  are they going to save themselves by reversing their behavior or are they going to double down
[03:03:41.800 --> 03:03:47.400]  on their own fraudulent behavior history tells us that they double down and they push their luck
[03:03:47.400 --> 03:03:52.520]  and there is a you know a revolution of some type and we've already seen it in the middle east and
[03:03:52.520 --> 03:03:59.560]  we're seeing huge outbreaks of social unrest already i would imagine that in britain and within
[03:03:59.560 --> 03:04:05.240]  six months you'll see what we've seen in greece because their economy is in freefall as soon as
[03:04:05.240 --> 03:04:11.160]  the olympics are over the next round of economic numbers will be reported it'll be confirmed that
[03:04:11.160 --> 03:04:16.200]  the uk is just teeter above depression and the people are going to be out in the streets you
[03:04:16.200 --> 03:04:20.280]  know you have two million people on the streets anti-war so that we know that they can get out
[03:04:20.280 --> 03:04:24.600]  under the streets now when they'll be out there fighting for themselves they will be and they
[03:04:24.600 --> 03:04:30.680]  won't be happy well said max keiser max keiser dot com thank you for spending time with us today i
