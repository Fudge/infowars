[00:00.000 --> 00:10.520]  In the movie Knowing, the news reported a major oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.
[00:10.520 --> 00:15.840]  Tonight in the Gulf of Mexico, an explosion on a soon-to-be decommissioned oil rig triggered
[00:15.840 --> 00:19.320]  a fire which burned for three hours before it was extinguished.
[00:19.320 --> 00:23.600]  Officials don't yet know the exact cause of the explosion, but believe a malfunction
[00:23.600 --> 00:26.000]  in the cooling system may have been at fault.
[00:26.000 --> 00:32.800]  To hear the prompt response of the rescue unit, the structure was evacuated with no loss of
[00:32.800 --> 00:33.800]  life.
[00:33.800 --> 00:38.480]  A year later, the Deepwater Horizon exploded.
[00:38.480 --> 00:45.920]  Six months before 9-11, a lone gunman episode showed us the World Trade Center being targeted
[00:45.920 --> 00:48.080]  by a hijacked passenger plane.
[00:48.080 --> 01:03.160]  And last year's film, White Noise, was about a train wreck that poisons a small town in
[01:03.160 --> 01:21.480]  Ohio.
[01:21.480 --> 01:26.080]  This is the very same story now playing out in real life.
[01:26.080 --> 01:34.600]  In a year of White Noise's release, the actual event occurs in real life in Ohio, in Texas,
[01:34.600 --> 01:36.120]  and in Michigan.
[01:36.120 --> 01:41.920]  This is known as predictive programming, and its purpose is to psychologically trick the
[01:41.920 --> 01:49.280]  minds of the masses into accepting major traumatic events that would otherwise be resisted.
[01:49.280 --> 01:56.000]  In the book Secret Societies and Psychological Warfare, Michael Hoffman describes a mind-controlled
[01:56.000 --> 02:02.240]  technique known as the revelation of the method, and he writes that, when the revelation of
[02:02.240 --> 02:08.960]  the method is performed in a veiled manner, accompanied by certain occult signs and symbolic
[02:08.960 --> 02:15.920]  words and elicits no meaningful response of opposition or resistance from the target,
[02:15.920 --> 02:22.240]  it is one of the most efficacious techniques of psychological warfare and mind rape.
[02:22.240 --> 02:28.960]  Sarah Elcaldi of the Alchemist YouTube channel does an excellent job of explaining all this.
[02:28.960 --> 02:34.720]  According to Elcaldi, there is a law of nature in this universe that compels the dark occult
[02:34.720 --> 02:41.400]  to first gain our consent before trespassing against us, because they believe this protects
[02:41.400 --> 02:45.000]  them from the natural laws of cause and effect.
[02:45.000 --> 02:48.880]  They offered, and we accepted, so it's all fair.
[02:48.880 --> 02:55.320]  A lack of response to an action is often taken as an approval of that action, and there
[02:55.320 --> 03:00.760]  is an old Latin proverb that says, he who is silent when he ought to have spoken and
[03:00.760 --> 03:04.520]  was able to, is taken to agree.
[03:04.520 --> 03:10.200]  Silence is considered by many to be a form of consent, and so it is through a veiled
[03:10.200 --> 03:16.480]  performance of the revelation of the method technique that these dark occultists believe
[03:16.480 --> 03:21.800]  they are gaining our consent, what we know as predictive programming.
[03:21.800 --> 03:27.360]  With predictive programming, the minds of the masses are impregnated with visuals of
[03:27.360 --> 03:31.000]  a major event before it happens.
[03:31.000 --> 03:36.960]  This is done through all forms of media and can be very subtle so that nobody notices,
[03:36.960 --> 03:43.760]  but the subconscious mind notices everything and can easily be programmed through repetition.
[03:43.760 --> 03:50.800]  And so these controllers repeat whatever it is that they want us to accept as reality.
[03:50.800 --> 03:55.800]  Because these images are delivered to us through entertainment, they elicit no meaningful
[03:55.800 --> 04:02.760]  response of opposition or resistance, and so we accept them subconsciously.
[04:02.760 --> 04:08.520]  And when the event happens in real life, it is already familiar and acceptable to us as
[04:08.520 --> 04:11.640]  if that's just the way it is.
[04:11.640 --> 04:17.640]  It's a mind trick and it works by keeping everyone locked in a spectator state.
[04:17.640 --> 04:23.680]  This causes what is known as paradigm blindness, which is when a person is incapable of seeing
[04:23.680 --> 04:28.580]  any reality other than what they've already been exposed to by the media.
[04:28.580 --> 04:34.240]  This paradigm blindness will cause a person to get emotionally triggered whenever confronted
[04:34.240 --> 04:39.200]  with an alternative point of view that they have not been programmed to accept.
[04:39.200 --> 04:43.680]  It's a very powerful mind trick and the solution is quite simple.
[04:43.680 --> 04:48.640]  We need to stop living as spectators of someone else's reality.
[04:48.640 --> 04:55.080]  We need to start creating our own reality and we need to remember how to say no because
[04:55.080 --> 05:25.080]  they offer it to us
[05:55.080 --> 05:56.080]  and it funds the M4.

[06:41.200 --> 06:48.120]  And we are live Friday, February 17, 2023.
[06:48.120 --> 06:55.160]  Jack Pasobak is coming up to cover the waterfront, including Biden refusing any federal aid, Ohio,
[06:55.160 --> 07:00.840]  and the Superfund site burning in plain view and raining down toxic waste over at least
[07:00.840 --> 07:07.560]  five states in Canada, the Russia situation with Ukraine, and more with the great Jack
[07:07.560 --> 07:16.400]  Pasobak, and then the amazing informative Tate Iyer will be in studio today hosting
[07:16.400 --> 07:22.680]  the fourth hour and then he and his equally intelligent writer, researcher, podcaster,
[07:22.680 --> 07:29.520]  wife will guest host being a two hour commercial free live transmission tomorrow, 11am Central
[07:29.520 --> 07:34.080]  Texas time on Saturday tomorrow.
[07:34.080 --> 07:39.080]  All right, wow, let me just hit some of the news here.
[07:39.080 --> 07:42.800]  I've got a big stack of world government news being openly announced and they define world
[07:42.800 --> 07:47.520]  government as taking over your body, tracking everything you do, cutting off your resources
[07:47.520 --> 07:49.520]  and euthanizing them.
[07:49.520 --> 07:54.840]  So we have that and we have Baylor Ruth says is ready to join Russia in the second big offensive
[07:54.840 --> 07:55.840]  taking place.
[07:55.840 --> 07:58.720]  That's massive news.
[07:58.720 --> 08:05.080]  We have over the top important victories against the poison COVID shots, a big giant stack
[08:05.080 --> 08:07.480]  of news there.
[08:07.480 --> 08:11.640]  We have another report here of the National Post of Canada, 19 year old becomes youngest
[08:11.640 --> 08:18.680]  ever diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease as neurological disorders explode because of
[08:18.680 --> 08:21.000]  all the toxins in our environment.
[08:21.000 --> 08:26.240]  Also more on beings AI bot tells reporter it wants to be alive, steal nuclear codes and
[08:26.240 --> 08:30.400]  create deadly virus program by the globalist.
[08:30.400 --> 08:35.600]  The kiss of death Florida governor Ronis Sanis endorsed by George Soros, a lot of the pro
[08:35.600 --> 08:39.560]  Trump crowd and I still like Trump overall compared to the left obviously but I mean
[08:39.560 --> 08:44.480]  come on our running around saying this is a Soros endorsement of the Sanis and I'm going
[08:44.480 --> 08:46.080]  to play the clip.
[08:46.080 --> 08:52.440]  It's not it's a Machiavelli and sociopathic psychopathic statement about the two and we'll
[08:52.440 --> 08:56.200]  be playing the actual full clip not just the little 30 second clip that's going around
[08:56.200 --> 08:59.880]  and it's not about defending the Sanis it's just that I'm not going to dunk on Trump
[08:59.880 --> 09:09.600]  here when or dunk on to Sanis here when it's not accurate.
[09:09.600 --> 09:14.240]  Back a few weeks ago when the Republicans got control of the house I said I'm going
[09:14.240 --> 09:20.720]  to give McCarthy a month to see if he moves for impeachment and hearings on gain of function
[09:20.720 --> 09:25.640]  and the open borders and everything else and we've seen some good hearings but none really
[09:25.640 --> 09:30.240]  on those subjects and we haven't seen McCarthy up there pushing that effect he's been blocking
[09:30.240 --> 09:36.480]  it so I'm getting really really upset we thought this was coming but now it's happening and
[09:36.480 --> 09:42.040]  it's very very disgusting we put a lot of pressure on those establishment Republicans
[09:42.040 --> 09:46.760]  and on the good Republicans in the house to go back after McCarthy again and halt for
[09:46.760 --> 09:53.440]  his removal if he won't do the constitutional common sense thing so we're going to be looking
[09:53.440 --> 09:59.320]  at all of that as well today and we're now learning more about the balloons shot down
[09:59.320 --> 10:06.240]  in the US and Canada I had said these probably are university or hobby groups balloons because
[10:06.240 --> 10:13.480]  they're only up at 20 30 40,000 feet and they're described as tiny and there's all sorts of
[10:13.480 --> 10:19.680]  Boy Scout groups launch balloons and test things out and colleges do it and high schools
[10:19.680 --> 10:25.720]  do it and well Illinois Hobby Club believes Pentagon shot down their $12 Pico balloon
[10:25.720 --> 10:34.520]  that's silver and when blown up about 10 feet across so we're going to be looking at that
[10:34.520 --> 10:40.240]  they use two sidewinder $400,000 missiles a piece because they miss it the first time
[10:40.240 --> 10:44.480]  and I know why they miss it it has it has no avionics and has no electronic signature
[10:44.480 --> 10:51.520]  that's what those missiles hone in on and it's just floating around I mean it's ridiculous
[10:51.520 --> 10:55.920]  I'm surprised they could hit it with two missiles surprise it didn't take more so we're going
[10:55.920 --> 11:01.360]  to be looking at that Federman checks himself into the hospital for clinical depression
[11:01.360 --> 11:07.920]  they say he'll be in there for a few weeks that creature is definitely dying and he's
[11:07.920 --> 11:12.200]  even admitted reportedly that the campaigning he thinks has killed him so we're going to
[11:12.200 --> 11:21.520]  be looking at all of that and so much more today also a big stack of news here dealing
[11:21.520 --> 11:29.760]  with crime statistics of where in the last 40 years since the 70s you've had 10 to one
[11:29.760 --> 11:34.800]  black on white crime that's because a certain minority of black people believe it's okay
[11:34.800 --> 11:38.200]  to attack white people because they've been taught white people are inherently bad so
[11:38.200 --> 11:42.280]  it's racism not the majority of black folks not even minority of them but a very small
[11:42.280 --> 11:48.480]  minority but it's still a very active criminal group and those are just the statistics but
[11:48.480 --> 11:52.200]  the FBI puts out skewed numbers by cherry picking things saying the number one threat
[11:52.200 --> 11:56.280]  is white supremacy which this isn't true and a few weeks ago I talked about the fact that
[11:56.280 --> 12:00.920]  we have to come together through Christ stop killing each other stop attacking each other
[12:00.920 --> 12:05.320]  but also we need to prosecute anybody whether they're a white person attacking a black person
[12:05.320 --> 12:08.960]  or a black person attacking a white person and let folks know this is not acceptable
[12:08.960 --> 12:13.080]  all over the country attacks on whites are not even being investigated by the George
[12:13.080 --> 12:20.000]  Soros DA's so I said I don't want to race for but I said if they successfully trigger
[12:20.000 --> 12:25.120]  one during a collapse and I don't care if it was the KKK surrounding some black person's
[12:25.120 --> 12:29.240]  house like they've done in the past that's why we've got guns and black people being
[12:29.240 --> 12:34.720]  attacked by the KKK even when it happens should defend themselves and kill anybody they need
[12:34.720 --> 12:39.240]  to to protect their family you don't want to and I said the same thing goes if a horde
[12:39.240 --> 12:44.240]  of racist black people are coming after you trying to hurt you trying to kill you and
[12:44.240 --> 12:49.000]  we actually are seeing that and that statistically is exploding that we should culturally say
[12:49.000 --> 12:53.240]  that's wrong before it's out of hand but if 20 anti-foot were trying to break in my house
[12:53.240 --> 12:59.480]  and kill me or 20 black lives matter communists or 20 white supremacists and by the way I
[12:59.480 --> 13:02.040]  had white supremacists actually threatened me quite a bit they don't like me because
[13:02.040 --> 13:11.280]  I'm not anti-Jew I will defend myself from violent KKK black supremacist antifa or anybody
[13:11.280 --> 13:16.440]  else that tries to hurt my family and I will put down as many people as I have to to protect
[13:16.440 --> 13:24.440]  my family and no more for two weeks they've had fake news articles everywhere saying that
[13:24.440 --> 13:29.840]  I'm saying go mow down black people sorry that's the new black Panther Party saying
[13:29.840 --> 13:34.920]  that and that's Chris Cuomo saying he wanted to kill everybody kill everybody at CNN going
[13:34.920 --> 13:42.840]  to mass shooting rampage but he decided not to so that's that's Fredo that's actually
[13:42.840 --> 13:48.600]  saying that not me everybody that listens knows I want peace I want justice and the
[13:48.600 --> 13:55.880]  number one group in America being killed is black people and it's not by police you are
[13:55.880 --> 13:59.680]  twice as likely of your wife to be killed by police statistically that's not because there's
[13:59.680 --> 14:07.240]  more white people blacks and 30% of the population whites are like 49 no ladies and gentlemen
[14:07.240 --> 14:13.200]  it's black person to white person ratioed you're twice as likely look it up statistics
[14:13.200 --> 14:18.360]  are out there just type in white people are twice as likely to be shot by police and that's
[14:18.360 --> 14:23.200]  because the police actually will go into mainly white or wealthy neighborhoods or places that
[14:23.200 --> 14:26.440]  they don't think they're going to get nailed to the wall if they defend themselves or make
[14:26.440 --> 14:34.080]  a mistake so they slow row into black slow roll into black communities and you see this
[14:34.080 --> 14:40.160]  in departments that are mainly black like Atlanta it's come out that they're slow rolling
[14:40.160 --> 14:45.720]  into predominantly lower income black neighborhoods they fast roll into the middle class wealthy
[14:45.720 --> 14:51.240]  black areas there's plenty of those in Atlanta and everywhere else but the point is they
[14:51.240 --> 14:57.240]  don't feel like anybody has their back so you do have the highest death rates from crime
[14:57.240 --> 15:03.840]  in America black on black that's the number one statistically per capita highest crime
[15:03.840 --> 15:12.160]  rate number is black on black next is black on white next is Hispanic on Hispanic next
[15:12.160 --> 15:18.640]  is white on white and you go down the line Asians have the lowest violent crime rate
[15:18.640 --> 15:23.720]  there is it's just a fact and I'm not lionizing Asians I'm not saying they're perfect I'm
[15:23.720 --> 15:29.280]  not saying they're angels I'm not saying they're wonderful but who's killing black people
[15:29.280 --> 15:36.120]  black people who's killing white people black people statistically and who's really killing
[15:36.120 --> 15:40.840]  the black people is playing parenthood on the left where over 70% of black babies never
[15:40.840 --> 15:45.280]  get out of the womb when they do their families is non-existent so they turn to a lot of crime
[15:45.280 --> 15:49.320]  which all statistics show whether you're black white or brown if you come from a single parent
[15:49.320 --> 15:53.600]  home you are three to seven times more likely to be imprisoned be a violent criminal or
[15:53.600 --> 16:02.080]  on drugs or commit suicide it's a fact we'll be right back stay with us I talk a lot about

[19:16.040 --> 19:21.160]  to think info wars is dead but if you simply stand up and support info wars we've got years

[20:03.160 --> 20:21.000]  assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones it's friday february 17 2023
[20:21.000 --> 20:35.720]  you're listening to the alex jones show don't forget tomorrow 11am central two hours commercial
[20:35.720 --> 20:50.800]  free with j dyer and his amazing co-host piercing the night 400 horsepower about a thousand
[20:50.800 --> 20:58.720]  horsepower yeah i got a car with a thousand horsepower but i'm going to get rid of it
[20:58.720 --> 21:02.720]  in the bankruptcy i should anyways i don't even ever really drive it anymore it's it's
[21:02.720 --> 21:10.640]  too ridiculous but it's such a piece of anti al gore americana i had to have the dodge hellcat
[21:10.640 --> 21:14.840]  demon but i didn't like the name demon so then another year they came out with one they
[21:14.840 --> 21:22.160]  didn't call it a demon and i got a green demon and uh fastest production car ever made and
[21:22.160 --> 21:30.840]  i've only opened it up full power once and i was going 150 miles an hour so fast to make
[21:30.840 --> 21:36.440]  your head spin with twin superchargers so yes one of my guilty pleasures and i've had
[21:36.440 --> 21:41.200]  the car four years and i've basically drive it like three times a year because it's it's
[21:41.200 --> 21:48.480]  not good to do such things even out on the toll road when nobody's out there but i i
[21:48.480 --> 21:54.800]  hear that white zombie song black sunshine and it makes me makes me think about that car
[21:54.800 --> 22:02.440]  because it is it is a devil it is bad it is out of control it is fast as hell and it's
[22:02.440 --> 22:10.880]  just ridiculous because i had a 400 horsepower Mustang a green Mustang when i was 20 for
[22:10.880 --> 22:16.400]  a couple years and i remember driving that back from our family ranch when i'd been
[22:16.400 --> 22:21.800]  deer hunting one time in an ice storm when nobody was on the roads like a maniac at about
[22:21.800 --> 22:27.920]  130 miles an hour average speed from east texas all the way back to austin listening
[22:27.920 --> 22:33.920]  to on cassette the album we were just coming in from break on and why am i talking about
[22:33.920 --> 22:38.680]  that because i'm reminiscing and i'm admitting something i did that was wrong and i would
[22:38.680 --> 22:42.920]  encourage young people particularly not to behave like that because you can hurt not
[22:42.920 --> 22:50.560]  just yourself but others but that's why you get older you get smarter ladies and gentlemen
[22:50.560 --> 22:56.400]  so oh we're gonna look at some dodge cars here they've announced not making these anymore
[22:56.400 --> 23:02.680]  to save the earth that's right what it really is is a drag racer the thousand horsepower
[23:02.680 --> 23:08.360]  one is a drag racer and it's uh the car would go 300 miles an hour if you didn't fly off
[23:08.360 --> 23:15.360]  the road so all right stop that's enough please stop showing it to me please stop tempting
[23:15.360 --> 23:22.360]  me let me tell you there's no drug like doing 200 miles an hour and uh let's just stop stop
[23:22.360 --> 23:25.840]  stop stop stop talking about it because we have a lot of serious issues to cover excuse
[23:25.840 --> 23:35.320]  me lord being tempted right now by the demon the literal the literal machine demon good
[23:35.320 --> 23:41.520]  stuff okay until you're dead let's get serious because i got a lot of news to it so i was
[23:41.520 --> 23:45.720]  very clear a few weeks ago i said the globals are exterminating black people with the poison
[23:45.720 --> 23:49.320]  shocks and they're killing them in the womb and they're weaponizing and trying to make
[23:49.320 --> 23:53.080]  by people racist and anti-white you see it everywhere so that we all come against each
[23:53.080 --> 23:57.160]  other we got to come together and i said we got to work hard on this before they trigger
[23:57.160 --> 24:02.000]  a full-on race war we're already in a soft race war right now twenty to one crimes against
[24:02.000 --> 24:07.640]  whites committed by that small minority of minority blacks that are doing that but i
[24:07.640 --> 24:11.880]  said that doesn't change the fact that if some racist groups coming after you to kill you
[24:11.880 --> 24:16.520]  and hurt your family you got to defend yourself and i've always been very clear on that and
[24:16.520 --> 24:20.720]  i'm not defending myself here this is a way to illustrate our mainstream media the enemy
[24:20.720 --> 24:24.920]  takes things out of context and just parses words and puts them together in an article
[24:24.920 --> 24:29.320]  to misrepresent what i said everybody knows what i say every day till everyone you need
[24:29.320 --> 24:36.200]  to close quote alex jones conspiracy theory about foaming at the mouth black people i
[24:36.200 --> 24:41.920]  said foaming at the mouth racist hordes of black people and i said the same thing last
[24:41.920 --> 24:48.240]  year with gop house candidate former nfl football player gerome davidson vows to fight democrats
[24:48.240 --> 24:55.960]  in clan hoods with ar-15 and i defended his ad it's kkk it's malcolm x him style at the
[24:55.960 --> 25:01.000]  window with his assault rifle and the kkk comes to kill him at his house and he kills
[25:01.000 --> 25:08.040]  them i don't care and i support his ad if it's the kkk or a black kkk that's why we
[25:08.040 --> 25:14.080]  have guns to protect ourselves from this type of garbage and i tell you if the gangs raping
[25:14.080 --> 25:18.240]  killing and murdering people in the new york subways they had a second amendment there
[25:18.240 --> 25:23.560]  this would not be happening the crime rates wouldn't be the highest in the world in democrat
[25:23.560 --> 25:29.080]  cities in america not just the highest here the highest in the world chicago new york
[25:29.080 --> 25:35.880]  you name it so yes i don't care if it's the black kkk or the white kkk or antifook comes
[25:35.880 --> 25:40.000]  to your house to hurt you and your family you have a right and a duty to defend yourself
[25:40.000 --> 25:52.760]  here's the congressional tv ad here in oh it's b-roll okay do this for me guys grab
[25:52.760 --> 25:57.680]  the actual video with the audio pretty please triple cupcakes on top like i said about ten
[25:57.680 --> 26:01.680]  minutes for the show i really want to download that video and i want to play it here on air
[26:01.680 --> 26:06.560]  that's the that's the point of getting a video i'm not mad it's just that i i i want to show
[26:06.560 --> 26:13.200]  his ad that's the whole point of this segment okay you now have a great job here it is
[26:15.200 --> 26:21.680]  democrats like to say that no one needs an ar-15 for self-defense that no one could possibly
[26:21.680 --> 26:28.320]  need all 30 rounds but with this rifle is the only thing standing between your family
[26:30.240 --> 26:36.000]  and a dozen angry democrats in klan hoods you just might need that semi-automatic
[26:37.360 --> 26:38.720]  in all 30 rounds
[26:38.720 --> 26:51.440]  all right so there you go and remember the mccluskies is that how you pronounce her name
[26:51.440 --> 26:56.000]  in st louis the people break down their gate they come in they're screaming racial epithets
[26:56.000 --> 26:59.760]  at them white black you name it and they just come out with a handgun and a rifle and say get
[26:59.760 --> 27:03.360]  off our line and the media said they were basically terrorists and they charged them
[27:03.360 --> 27:09.040]  but i mean what would you do if a group of white people black people anybody a mob
[27:09.600 --> 27:13.920]  breaks down your gate is coming towards your house you're supposed to go out there with a gun
[27:13.920 --> 27:18.640]  and say leave and it de-escalated the situation and they left but you see all these other leftist
[27:18.640 --> 27:23.920]  events with black lives matter anti for all these groups burning down buildings killing people
[27:23.920 --> 27:28.720]  shooting people dragging them out of their cars and they do it in leftist cities because they
[27:28.720 --> 27:34.720]  know statistically the general law abiding public follows the unconstitutional law and does not have
[27:34.720 --> 27:41.200]  a gun to protect themselves so i'll say it again work for peace work for justice work for love
[27:41.200 --> 27:47.120]  come together don't let the system vulcanize us but i don't care what color your skin is
[27:47.120 --> 27:52.720]  if a group of people criminals in a collapsed situation that's what i was talking about are
[27:52.720 --> 27:57.440]  coming to drag you out of your house and burn your house down and probably rape and kill you i
[27:57.440 --> 28:03.440]  don't care what color they are you have a right to get them off of you and do what you have to do
[28:04.640 --> 28:11.680]  that's what i said kill everyone you need to because that's the point of killing somebody
[28:11.680 --> 28:15.920]  when they're trying to kill you when the cops pull somebody over and the person jumps out with a gun
[28:15.920 --> 28:20.640]  and starts shooting at them the cops aren't shooting at their legs they're shooting at their chest
[28:20.640 --> 28:29.120]  to stop them from shooting at them so i don't care who you are the nra was founded to teach northerners
[28:29.120 --> 28:34.640]  how to shoot because they weren't rural and to get blacks guns that's on record after the civil war
[28:34.640 --> 28:41.680]  but the media calls the nra the kkk when they were founded directly against the kkk so that's
[28:41.680 --> 28:46.320]  the truth that's what i said that's what i meant but none of these propaganda pieces work people
[28:46.320 --> 28:55.680]  know the truth about the enemy of the people the corporate press we're gonna break we're gonna come

[33:56.640 --> 34:02.560]  are loving it takes us in a lot of unexpected directions and angles and we're going to do it
[34:02.560 --> 34:08.560]  again today and we're going to do it again tomorrow when jade irons in here for two hours uninterrupted
[34:09.360 --> 34:15.120]  we're going to do an hour with jay and his lovely wife and then we are going to take
[34:15.120 --> 34:22.800]  your phone calls at 11am tomorrow with the saturday show here at info wars.com now i'm
[34:22.800 --> 34:29.200]  going to plow through this news i'm going to cover just bam bam bam a ton of these headlines and then
[34:29.200 --> 34:34.240]  i'm going to open the phones up for a free for all just like yesterday any topic any subject any
[34:34.240 --> 34:40.640]  question anything you want to cover you agree you disagree but i wish if you call in and disagree
[34:40.640 --> 34:45.520]  don't just say you're a fat ass city slicker that doesn't know anything about skinning a buck
[34:45.520 --> 34:50.400]  and running a trot line like that guy called in i mean that was entertaining but it's just stupid
[34:51.040 --> 34:57.600]  i wasn't claiming to be paul bunion or you know uh grizzly adams here i was saying we all need to
[34:57.600 --> 35:04.720]  learn how to garden and how to farm and and and and how to tie a knot and and you know how to
[35:04.720 --> 35:11.840]  uh roof a house carpentry all those are skills that humans are great at and we need to build a
[35:11.840 --> 35:18.560]  pro human future that was what that whole rant was about yesterday and so when i say calling
[35:18.560 --> 35:23.120]  a disagree you can say whatever the hell you want it's just that why don't people that ever call
[35:23.120 --> 35:31.120]  in and disagree call in and say i think you're wrong about x y or some real issue i mean that
[35:31.120 --> 35:36.160]  said a lot of folks have called in and taken me to the woodshed on my quote support of trump
[35:36.800 --> 35:40.560]  because so many of you are mad at trump i'm not supporting trump but i'm not going to make him my
[35:40.560 --> 35:44.240]  main enemy and i'm not going to spend all my time attacking him when i'm dealing with the democrats
[35:44.240 --> 35:49.120]  and claus schwaub and bill gates of the new world order the fact that trump tied his wagon to the
[35:49.120 --> 35:54.720]  poisoned shot it's his problem and it's hurting bad and speaking of that let's get to this story
[35:54.720 --> 36:01.440]  first i'm not going to air the 30-something second clip that everybody's passing around there's no
[36:01.440 --> 36:06.560]  point duplicating it i'm going to play the actual two and a half minute clip of what this
[36:10.480 --> 36:16.160]  new world order magician of evil had to say but but here's the headline the kiss of death florida
[36:16.720 --> 36:23.600]  governor ronda sanis endorsed by george soros now again was he really endorsed by george
[36:23.600 --> 36:31.840]  soros no not in my opinion you can disagree but george soros is sitting there reading off a script
[36:31.840 --> 36:39.120]  can barely talk he's obviously preparing himself for his journey to haiti's and here's the arch
[36:39.120 --> 36:43.120]  criminal that worked for the nazis that overthrew all these countries that stole all these pension
[36:43.120 --> 36:47.520]  funds around the world the left worships that has put in over a thousand da's and district
[36:47.520 --> 36:52.080]  attorneys that are currently serving and he has something like 22 of the attorney generals of
[36:52.080 --> 36:57.360]  the states under his control uh letting violent criminals out keeping nonviolent people in
[36:58.880 --> 37:04.000]  letting crime victims get no justice and dropping prosecutions or even rape and armed robbery and
[37:04.000 --> 37:10.320]  people that have shot folks i mean this guy is a villain's villain and here he is in a mackey of
[37:10.320 --> 37:16.560]  elliway talking about trump versus the sanis and saying that basically he's giving the sanis
[37:16.560 --> 37:24.640]  compliments because he's i guess more controlled in soros's view uh than trump and saying he would
[37:24.640 --> 37:33.200]  be the preferable candidate to win in 2024 or he's saying he will win now is that really an
[37:33.200 --> 37:38.960]  endorsement no i don't think it is and i remember when rand paul first won the senate 10 years ago
[37:38.960 --> 37:44.480]  or whenever it was it was eight nine ten years ago politico called me up and they said alex
[37:44.480 --> 37:48.000]  you help rand paul get elected he's giving you credit
[37:52.000 --> 37:57.200]  how did he win how could he have been defeated he could pull the article up i told politico
[37:57.760 --> 38:02.560]  well you would have had to endorse him because you're so hated as the establishment
[38:02.560 --> 38:08.160]  that if you would have endorsed him people would have probably not voted for him so we got to look
[38:08.160 --> 38:12.320]  for that trick you know we've heard a lot of stuff that the sanis and i'm not defending sanis here
[38:12.320 --> 38:20.560]  i'm watching very closely but the sanis did not go to skull and bones it's not true look it up
[38:21.280 --> 38:27.200]  and a lot of these things here about the sanis are not true and i don't think this is an accurate
[38:27.200 --> 38:34.560]  representation this clip to say that george soros just endorsed him but you decide for yourself
[38:34.560 --> 38:38.000]  and when we open the phones up if you want to call and disagree with me or agree i'd love to hear it
[38:38.000 --> 38:50.880]  but here it is trump attracted a lot of non-educated white followers but his biggest
[38:50.880 --> 39:01.600]  packers were the mega rich and he certainly delivered for them first he cut their taxes
[39:01.600 --> 39:18.400]  second he nominated the supreme court ideologues who embraced an extreme version of the republican
[39:18.400 --> 39:28.080]  agenda third he built the republican party under his control by threatening those who
[39:28.080 --> 39:39.280]  didn't swear loyalty to him with a challenge in the primaries lastly encouraged republican
[39:39.280 --> 39:48.560]  control states to introduce outrageous measures of voter suppression to ensure that his party
[39:48.560 --> 39:58.320]  would remain in power indefinitely with that program he was almost reelected in 2020
[40:01.360 --> 40:14.800]  my hope for 2024 is that trump and governor's desantis of florida will slug it out for the
[40:14.800 --> 40:25.280]  republican nomination trump has turned into a pitiful figure continually bemoaning his loss
[40:25.280 --> 40:39.200]  in 2020 big republican donors are abandoning him in droves desantis is shrewd ruthless and ambitious
[40:39.200 --> 40:53.360]  is likely to be a republican candidate this could induce trump whose narcissism has turned into
[40:53.360 --> 41:03.760]  a disease to run as a third party candidate that would lead to a democratic landslide
[41:03.760 --> 41:15.360]  and force the republican parties to reform itself but perhaps i may be just a little bit biased
[41:21.760 --> 41:28.160]  okay so he didn't really say he wanted to send us there did he but if you watch the clip from
[41:28.160 --> 41:34.160]  the middle taken out of context by a lot of people i like it sounds like he endorsed the sanis
[41:37.120 --> 41:40.960]  but he really just said if trump gets the nomination he's going to lose in a landslide
[41:43.520 --> 41:50.720]  to the democrats and that's what basically soros wants so no that was not an endorsement
[41:50.720 --> 41:59.520]  by george soros of governor desantis period all right i'm gonna give the number out right now

[47:37.520 --> 47:44.560]  next segment but i wanted to clarify something else i said in the first 30 minutes of thursday show
[47:44.560 --> 47:50.240]  yesterday that went viral on instagram twitter people sent it to me one video had like a million
[47:50.240 --> 47:55.200]  half views jack was so big tweeted had like a hundred thousand views and it was trending alex
[47:55.200 --> 48:01.120]  jones says he has completed his mission and then i saw a lot of the commenters saying oh my gosh
[48:01.120 --> 48:09.520]  he's quitting or you know oh my gosh he's going away no that's not what i said i said i knew my
[48:09.520 --> 48:13.680]  mission was to expose the new world order because i knew that everything the globalist had talked
[48:13.680 --> 48:19.200]  about doing 60 70 years ago by the time i was reading their documents they basically got done
[48:19.200 --> 48:22.880]  and so i went well wait a minute that means they're going to get the rest of this done these people
[48:22.880 --> 48:29.200]  mean business so i knew common sense and i knew that i believed in myself and believed in you
[48:29.200 --> 48:33.120]  that if we got ahead of it and expose the next part of their agenda that was so horrible and so
[48:33.120 --> 48:40.400]  dystopian and and so terrible for 99.9 percent of people that folks would make the right decision
[48:40.400 --> 48:46.240]  and reject the globalist new world order as you now see happening everywhere from joe rogan to elon
[48:46.240 --> 48:50.480]  mustard mainline even democrats are saying oh i don't want world government i don't want claus
[48:50.480 --> 48:53.840]  swabb running things i don't want bill gates running things i mean bill gates will be on
[48:53.840 --> 48:59.200]  an instagram video with 15 million views and there'll be a half a million comments and 99.9
[48:59.200 --> 49:04.960]  percent of them are anti bill gates they are screwed folks i've been telling that for a while
[49:06.240 --> 49:11.360]  and so i was saying our main mission was to alert the public and warn the world about
[49:11.360 --> 49:19.520]  going from testing and beta in the new world order into operational and so our mission myself
[49:19.520 --> 49:27.680]  our crew the guests the callers the viewers the listeners was to expose this now that doesn't
[49:27.680 --> 49:32.080]  mean i'm not going to continue on it doesn't mean that we need to expose the next phase and
[49:32.080 --> 49:36.400]  battle their current lies and we've got so much more to done but i spiritually
[49:36.400 --> 49:43.280]  i don't want to sit on the same drive i have because i'm even stronger driving ways but
[49:44.480 --> 49:50.960]  at a spiritual level god has literally laid it on my heart that don't beat yourself over the head
[49:50.960 --> 49:55.040]  give it all to me i'm going to take care of it keep fighting but look how far you've come look
[49:55.040 --> 49:58.960]  how far your audience of activists have come and we're going to do so much more together that's
[49:58.960 --> 50:03.040]  basically this what i get from the spirit and it's a very real thing and the enemy hates it
[50:03.040 --> 50:07.280]  they know we've got it we have that connection they can dial into the devil we can dial into god
[50:08.320 --> 50:13.040]  the devil forces himself on your psyche and attacks your free will god lovingly knocks on
[50:13.040 --> 50:21.600]  the door and empowers you if you so choose but it's been a long quest it's been quite the saga
[50:23.040 --> 50:27.760]  and i could have done it without you we did all this together i'm just a focal point and i wanted
[50:27.760 --> 50:33.840]  to just have a little bit of a celebration and clap for all of you out there and say man listen
[50:33.840 --> 50:38.480]  you did a great job spreading the word everything you've done and your investment with time energy
[50:38.480 --> 50:47.120]  and prayer and word of mouth has done a great thing but the spin that i'm going to give up or
[50:47.120 --> 50:54.480]  i'm going to go away or i've completed my mission i said i have completed you have completed you
[50:54.480 --> 50:58.240]  chose to choose the mission with me couldn't have done any of it without you i want you to really
[50:58.240 --> 51:05.360]  get that into your mind and brain and soul and heart and guts that we have completed the primary
[51:05.360 --> 51:10.400]  mission i'm getting chills right now we have completed the primary mission
[51:12.320 --> 51:17.840]  and the and the war is still raging but we're not being caught unaware now or flat footed
[51:18.720 --> 51:23.440]  and we are winning the information war the enemy admits that in their own leaks and own documents
[51:23.440 --> 51:28.960]  they are panicked and their goal is attack the leaders try to destroy us try to make us give up
[51:30.000 --> 51:35.920]  and i want my enemies to know i cannot physically give up and i will never give up and i'll be
[51:35.920 --> 51:46.560]  quite frank with you i'm not a sadomasochist i do not like pain but i know going through this pain
[51:46.560 --> 51:52.720]  means i'm measuring up to what i knew i could do with god's help and that we're hurting the new
[51:52.720 --> 51:59.600]  world order who's attacking our children and so in this case i will be completely honest
[52:01.600 --> 52:05.120]  i did not enjoy pain 10 years ago i did not enjoy pain 20 years ago
[52:06.240 --> 52:11.920]  and god has really gifted me and sent a comforter the holy spirit and i'll just be honest now i
[52:11.920 --> 52:19.760]  actually enjoy it and i want my enemies to know that i really enjoy your attacks i really enjoy
[52:19.760 --> 52:25.840]  your lies because the worse it gets the more i know i'm hurting you and i'm bringing you down
[52:25.840 --> 52:30.640]  we're bringing you down god's bringing you down and so i just want everybody to know
[52:30.640 --> 52:36.320]  i'm a winner and you're a winner and they spend all their time in thousands of articles a week
[52:36.320 --> 52:42.640]  lying about me alone because they're scared ladies and gentlemen of the spirit i've got
[52:42.640 --> 52:48.320]  and the spirit you've got and they know if that contagion that virus that bill clinton
[52:48.320 --> 52:53.760]  and barack obama and hillary clinton and all of them and ryan stelter have called me a virus
[52:53.760 --> 52:57.120]  and you know what we're not the virus we're the cure
[53:02.640 --> 53:07.840]  and so when you're in a war and you've had major victories you need to sit back and thank god i
[53:07.840 --> 53:16.160]  know i do and just think about how far we've come and what we've done together and then think about
[53:16.160 --> 53:21.840]  the success we've had and what we can do in the future together and i want to reach out to those
[53:21.840 --> 53:27.360]  that have been serving evil many of you unconsciously many of you just trying to win in the system going
[53:27.360 --> 53:31.120]  along to get along and you've had your heart touched and you know this is destructive and you
[53:31.120 --> 53:36.000]  know it's hurting you and your family and you don't know a way out of it god can lead god and direct
[53:36.000 --> 53:42.880]  you you can reach out just get in a dark room at night when the family's asleep and just sit there
[53:42.880 --> 53:48.000]  for about 30 minutes thinking about god saying god i want to know who you are i want you to
[53:48.000 --> 53:53.360]  show yourself to me in my life however you choose fit fit i'm not asking you for anything i'm just
[53:53.360 --> 53:58.960]  asking you to show me your power come into my heart give me discernment and tell me what it is i should
[53:58.960 --> 54:04.720]  do i want to know you and i'm sorry for what i've done and i know i'm a sinner and i know i need the
[54:04.720 --> 54:12.320]  blood of jesus to sanctify me and to purify me and to cleanse me i can't do it without you god
[54:12.320 --> 54:16.400]  help me and i suggest you do it in a dark room
[54:21.760 --> 54:28.000]  and i want you to just reach out with your hand with your eyes closed just reach out
[54:29.120 --> 54:34.240]  you'll probably feel like putting your hands up like this of course your hands are electromagnetic
[54:34.240 --> 54:39.040]  connections to your brain so your eyes so is every cell in your body but your hands particularly
[54:39.040 --> 54:43.840]  are the are the signant and the sign of your will and your action that's why you just put your hands
[54:43.840 --> 54:48.640]  up like solar panels to the holy spirit and that's why that's why people with the holy spirit they
[54:48.640 --> 54:52.960]  put their hands up no matter where they are in the world what time and age it was you put your hands
[54:52.960 --> 55:00.160]  up and you say god help me and you will feel the energy of christ and the energy through christ of
[55:00.160 --> 55:06.320]  the father and it's so simple just first reach your hand out and when you feel that energy of god
[55:06.320 --> 55:15.200]  you just simply say god i worship you i need you sanctify me purify me help me i'm weak but
[55:15.200 --> 55:20.080]  through you i can be strong help me help others and then you're going to feel that energy it's
[55:20.080 --> 55:24.160]  going to be exhausting just to sit there in the chair or stand there in your bedroom or in your
[55:24.160 --> 55:29.200]  living room or in your garage or on the back porch or wherever you are and then at a certain point
[55:29.200 --> 55:39.600]  you're going to feel it and you need to get on your knees and then this is what i do
[55:42.160 --> 55:45.440]  you just lay down on the ground with your hands out on the ground
[55:47.920 --> 55:50.240]  and you realize the holy spirit's everywhere it's not just coming
[55:50.960 --> 55:55.360]  inter dimensionally through the time space continuum but then you'll actually
[55:55.360 --> 56:00.560]  put your hands on the ground feel the energy of god coming through the earth and just lay there and
[56:00.560 --> 56:07.280]  then you're going to fall asleep you're going to wake up in 10 minutes maybe an hour maybe three
[56:07.280 --> 56:12.960]  hours later and if you will simply do that that's not taught in books that's not that's not anywhere
[56:12.960 --> 56:17.200]  that is my experience and i know how real it is and i'm telling you that experience right now and
[56:17.200 --> 56:21.840]  you could experience god right now and here's the rest of it i say it's not in books christ
[56:21.840 --> 56:27.280]  told his followers he told the Pharisees too when they were up on the hilltop
[56:27.280 --> 56:32.880]  bragging and praying how perfect they were he said don't pray like they do in public
[56:32.880 --> 56:38.400]  praying church together as a group but but don't sit there like a peacock in high noon praying to
[56:38.400 --> 56:45.360]  god in front of everyone go in your prayer closet go in a private place and really focus on god
[56:46.880 --> 56:51.040]  and then you're going to feel that connection and and a lot of you that are under evil control
[56:51.040 --> 56:55.200]  at first you're going to feel a block something blocking you something saying don't do that no
[56:55.200 --> 57:00.560]  no you're a failure you're not good you don't deserve this you're a bad person no no god god
[57:00.560 --> 57:06.160]  god's ashamed of you god doesn't like you no that's the devil and you just ignore that and say god
[57:06.160 --> 57:13.040]  help me help me and like a laser beam a particle beam burning through steel god is going to then
[57:13.040 --> 57:18.720]  laser beam the energy through there with your energy and it's going to connect to you just like
[57:18.720 --> 57:25.440]  in the sistine chapel with god touching adam and that finger is going to come down and when it makes
[57:25.440 --> 57:53.680]  connection it's the prepare for war i talk a lot about the great successes and full wars this
[57:53.680 --> 57:59.440]  had i don't think anybody can deny it and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us
[58:00.160 --> 58:03.840]  but when we talk about the crew at info wars people behind the scenes the researchers the
[58:03.840 --> 58:10.560]  writers they really have been the mvps in this fight and we look at harris and smith and the
[58:10.560 --> 58:16.560]  own stroyer and the hard work they engage in every day five six seven days a week it's really just
[58:16.560 --> 58:21.840]  incredible so for myself the whole info wars crew i thank you for your past support i only
[58:21.840 --> 58:27.760]  encourage you now to realize that info wars cannot stay on air if you do not support us i know you
[58:27.760 --> 58:31.840]  spread the word i know you pray for us and that's wonderful keep doing it but most viewers and
[58:31.840 --> 58:36.400]  listeners never go to info wars store dot com and you never buy great products that enrich and
[58:36.400 --> 58:40.880]  empower your life all at the same time keep us on air i know that less than one percent of our

[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:20.800]  february 16th 2023 i'll be here in live in the next four hours at a bonus royer
[01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:27.440]  three p.m central today on the info wars radio tv slash web network
[01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:35.360]  you know last night after my daughter went to sleep i did a couple hours research there on my
[01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:46.800]  desktop and without even looking i saw elon musk and joe rogan and tucker carlson and then all
[01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:52.960]  these world leaders as well both those promoting it and those saying it was bad just talking about
[01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:56.560]  world government and the new world order and how the private corporations are running things
[01:01:56.560 --> 01:02:00.640]  want to take control of our bodies and lives and how we've got to form an opposition against it
[01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:08.080]  and just like that all the pre-programming all the brainwashing all the lies saying never talk
[01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:13.360]  about a world government never talk about its agenda all the intimidation of decades and decades
[01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:22.640]  and decades failed and at the world government summit that ended just two days ago elon musk
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:28.320]  beamed into the event and said i'm against your world government and it's dangerous
[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:35.520]  and will collapse the planet which is its plan to take control a new feudalism the
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:41.760]  technocracy on its ashes and so it's an amazing moment here and how many times have
[01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:47.120]  longtime listeners or regular listeners heard me say my mission my primary mission
[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:51.920]  that i started out with 28 years ago
[01:02:55.120 --> 01:03:00.880]  will be complete when we at least have the world government out in the open and there's
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:06.720]  major opposition against it and it's normalized to realize it exists and to stand against it
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:12.400]  because its goals are bad for humanity when i say bad that's an understatement and so i'm not
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:24.320]  obsolete i'm not vestigial i've not been made irrelevant yet but that's my goal
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:31.440]  that my understanding and my knowledge that many other great men and women before me understood
[01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:36.960]  before i was born but was only known by a tiny one tenth of one percent of people in america
[01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:42.880]  and a few other countries that that would be mainlined so the whole new world order project
[01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:49.440]  would have to face resistance and so i want to just sit back here today for all the listeners
[01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:53.760]  and all the viewers and all the activists and the crew and our sponsors and those that have made
[01:03:53.760 --> 01:04:01.760]  this broadcast possible and all the amazing guests and i want us just to pause for a moment
[01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:06.320]  in fact i forgot to tell the crew to do this well you guys pull up some video or audio of
[01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:13.520]  standing ovation or a crowd applauding maybe that short clip before they cut my voice in with
[01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:18.640]  operatic singing it's like 30 seconds long cue that up in a moment i want to play it as a salute
[01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:24.560]  to everybody or maybe we should have a 21 gun salute but they can't get this project through
[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:29.520]  if when it launches the public a large portion of the public knows what it is
[01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:36.800]  and what its evil aims are and so all of you get the credit and yes i've gone through a lot of
[01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:41.120]  pain a lot of suffering but it's been well worth it because the taste of victory is so sweet
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:47.840]  to get to this point and we have achieved our primary mission we have achieved
[01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:55.360]  the primary mission that was literally laid on my heart by god when i was 18 years old
[01:04:56.720 --> 01:05:05.280]  when god touched my heart the cavalry has arrived ultimate bone broth is the strongest

[01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:51.040]  because that's how we fund our operation plus ladies and gentlemen you really need these products
[01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:57.280]  just like our information is game changing all the products we sell are the very best highest
[01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:04.000]  quality highest in supplements there are third party groups have gone out and tested our products
[01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:12.000]  and found that they are the very best out there for on average half the price i remember this
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:18.560]  is like eight nine years ago mark cuban owns a big testing company in san francisco that test
[01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:24.480]  supplements and they went out and tested a bunch of our supplements they said okay they're clean
[01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:30.160]  okay they're they're not bad but let us tell you what the best supplements are and it's actually a
[01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:40.560]  sales side yes and then he showed the vitamin b12 sublingual and said this is the best one but it
[01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:49.520]  was twice the price of ours this is the highest rated and it's where we were getting it from
[01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:54.560]  it was dr groups b12
[01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:05.440]  which is the highest rated so you see how that works mike adams owns a big he's had it for
[01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:11.200]  now six seven years big testing lab it's one of his businesses he's a publisher all over the world
[01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:16.960]  you name it that guy's a renaissance man and he went and tested r without me even asking him to
[01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:24.160]  do it he went and tested our cbd oil he's tested over 50 of them and he said there was only one
[01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:29.200]  other cbd oil that was as good as ours and it turns out that's the company we get it from
[01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:34.480]  so this is the highest end cbd oil there is that you're going to get at a clinic or a store over
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:40.000]  the counter for your joints your bones your brain your heart your whole body no thc doesn't get you
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:45.440]  high but those incredible things for your body it's like decaffeinated coffee doesn't have the

[01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:06.560]  60 something dollars so when i say 50 off it's way more than that and has 100 markup on it

[01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:44.480]  funds the operation helps spread the word as well wearing an info war shirt is quite an adventure
[01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:49.920]  out in public you mainly get love you'll also might get attacked so it's it's it's entering the
[01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:55.760]  matrix to wear one so that's coming back in x2 and x3 is back in the middle of march we've had a
[01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:59.280]  lot of complaints that's been out of stock we could buy crap iodine all day this is deep
[01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:05.840]  risk of iodine hard to get hard to source we got it coming in that's an info warstore.com
[01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:11.920]  and so i'm done talking about that but i appreciate all your support and making the broadcast
[01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:20.240]  possible all right let me let me hit let me hit this we'll go to break go back to your calls and
[01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:24.800]  then i'll hit the rest of it after we take calls look at this headline of the national post that's
[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:29.040]  the biggest newspaper out of canada and what they're saying is actually true because i've read
[01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:34.960]  the studies 19 year old becomes youngest ever diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and now
[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:38.880]  they're reporting it's quite normal to have Alzheimer's at 30 years old 25 years old but
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:45.840]  under an electron microscope the brain cells are dying from a protein infection basically
[01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:51.280]  a toxicity and they say they don't know why it's happening well it's the nano tech it's the gmo
[01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:58.960]  it's the spike proteins and it's tv and internet viewing and all the studies show this look it up
[01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:06.560]  nothing's better than listening or reading because when you listen you've got to imagine if you're
[01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:14.560]  listening and i say a green goblin with red eyes and and and purple feet with a big red tail
[01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:19.920]  your brain has to pull that from its knowledge your brain composites an image of that goblin
[01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:27.280]  and that fires neurons throughout the brain when you simply passively watch something and
[01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:31.360]  that's all you do six seven eight ten hours a day as the average person does
[01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:39.600]  neurons stop connecting and neurons collapse readings the same way when you read a book about
[01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:48.320]  she was a gorgeous brunette with blue eyes wearing a yellow bikini rubbing centan oil on her stomach
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:53.680]  and i was just struck like a thunderbolt by her incredible beauty and felt drawn to her
[01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:58.240]  you're now imaging a beautiful brunette with blue eyes and a yellow bikini but if i show you a
[01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:04.160]  brunette with blue eyes and yellow bikini you're just kind of okay you're not imaging it so listening
[01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:10.560]  and reading is good watching can be okay if there's articles documents subjects changing and it's not
[01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:17.040]  passive if it's interactive it's okay but still this medium of tv is not good for you people say
[01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:22.000]  why do you do it well i got a jacket in the matrix to reach people and once you're not in
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:27.520]  suspended disbelief anymore whether it's tv or news or fiction you're no longer even able to
[01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:34.320]  suspend disbelief i got to a movie cannot suspend disbelief i can't go into the trance the lower
[01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:39.200]  brain wave and do it i just don't do it because i'm analyzing everything in real time so it's
[01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:45.920]  actually making me stronger but when you just give in to tv and just lay back and just go to that
[01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:49.600]  zombie mode everybody's seeing pictures of kids watching tv and their mouths are hanging open
[01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:54.000]  that is damaging your brain here's the studies new study shows link between tv viewing and
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:15:05.040]  Alzheimer's can too much tv lead to dementia can tv lead to Alzheimer's well will binge watching tv
[01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:10.320]  increase your risk of Alzheimer's disease and diabetes yes the answer too much tv could raise
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:17.600]  the risk of Alzheimer's study finds washington post study suggests so that's what i'm telling you is
[01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:25.680]  don't be a spectator be a man and woman in the arena and you won't get the neurological disorders
[01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:29.600]  because the chemicals bombarding your brain are bad enough they kill neurons but your brain can
[01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:34.880]  rewire around that it can handle trauma but if it's not being challenged like lifting weights
[01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:38.880]  makes your muscles challenge if you don't challenge your brain then your brain says well i'm basically
[01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:44.560]  dead i'm just a vegetable i just watch things i'm going to give up don't give up get excited get

[01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:11.760]  this is an epic battle this is real and you could see the enemy's abject hate of this broadcast
[01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:15.200]  of our guests of our callers of our listeners and viewers and myself
[01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:20.160]  and realize we're over the target we're getting the greatest amount of slack
[01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:25.920]  because we are connected to god and we know how to win and we're not bowing down we're not getting
[01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:31.360]  weaker we're getting stronger in the face of these attacks we're making the neuron connections
[01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:39.360]  we're making the inner galactic spiritual next level spiritual connections we're not a false
[01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:46.320]  ideology we're not a lie we're not the thousands of fake systems out there to confuse you we are
[01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:51.600]  the truth you are the truth you're not perfect you know you're not perfect but you know god's
[01:21:51.600 --> 01:22:01.120]  perfect and you are asking god to save you you're saying i'm with you save me help me
[01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:05.840]  and then take action and gobble to the rest but god wants to see you
[01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:13.680]  you help yourself and then god will carry us the rest of the way listen to that angel's voice
[01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:24.720]  the march of humanity all of our ancestors our destiny we're not giving into ai we're not rolling
[01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:30.400]  over to dying in the new world order we're not letting these charlton's control us we will rise
[01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:38.720]  to the challenge together and win jay is the first caller from british columbia thanks for calling
[01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:48.560]  hi alex yes sir love you love you too brother i've been with you for this war since 2007
[01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:57.360]  and you are a soldier so thank you for your service thank you brother now in my soul i believe
[01:22:57.360 --> 01:23:04.800]  the social solution is a hands up revolution the universally most basic form of communication
[01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:10.240]  and signaling each other put your hands up if you want out from under the rug of tyranny
[01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:19.360]  the candlelight in the coliseum moment could be this very moment but first the horse must
[01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:26.800]  select its rider the viewers of this broadcast are the first of four vehicles of change
[01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:36.480]  in these times that is the blue horse in alex's hands are the scales to represent the reemergence
[01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:46.720]  of human equality the time has come make the sacrifice cast your vote in the form of a donation
[01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:53.440]  of any size to mount your rider that steers you to your destiny god intended for you
[01:23:53.440 --> 01:23:59.680]  but trample biden and the white horse so the remaining horses never ride
[01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:08.480]  god told you the future in your path so when we got to this very moment we would understand
[01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:18.000]  that deciphering this text we would know that we that we don't need saving we can save ourselves
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:26.080]  if we ask now so don't let another moment pass the horse absolutely brother beautifully said this
[01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:33.120]  is a spiritual war jordan in minnesota here on the air go ahead hey alex can you hear me i can't
[01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:39.600]  thanks for calling hey um jordan here from minnesota i've been listening to you since i've
[01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:46.480]  been 15 i'm about 24 now so quite a while first off i just want to say hallelujah praise you this
[01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:51.520]  because this is the day he's made and we shall rejoice and be glad in it um but first off i just
[01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:56.800]  want to talk about the objects that were shot down i know that one was shot down over lake here on
[01:24:57.520 --> 01:25:03.040]  one of the great lakes um as well as minnesota here where i'm at we also have a great lake but
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:10.240]  our governor had come up and said that um it had entered our airspace at one point this octagonal
[01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:17.760]  or a rectangular one that was shot down by um a fighter jet based out of our state and the
[01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:24.560]  confusing thing to me is um how they were talking about in montana where they had where is supposedly
[01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:31.360]  just a radar anomaly where i haven't been hearing much about uh north dakota either where um another
[01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:37.600]  one of our minot air force bases is so um i'm under the assumption that um this object may have been
[01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:44.000]  able to traverse all the way from montana through north dakota oh the first one of montana was the
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:48.480]  chinese balloon they admitted that then it looks like it was a hobby balloon out of illinois so that
[01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:53.120]  biden can shoot on anything in the air at 20 000 feet to make it look like he was doing something
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:59.600]  illinois hobby club believes pentagon shot down their $12 picko balloon oh yeah that's an experience
[01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:05.520]  that's an expensive mistake if i were to ever say one uh what's that two missiles $400 000 a piece
[01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:12.640]  sidewinder aim nines yeah it's not that's $800 000 yeah absolutely crazy absolutely insane
[01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:19.120]  and where do those tax dollars come from uh working class people's pockets so um but yeah i mean
[01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:24.000]  that's really that's really what i wanted to say to you alec and i wanted to tell you uh i listened
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:29.840]  to your show about um every morning i listened to harrison and i go on to your show and all the way
[01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:34.800]  up into owens show so it's well we appreciate you jordan it's good to have you listen for nine years

[01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:58.960]  a half million subscribers and he's basically a retired nurse teacher and educator yesterday i
[01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:08.480]  watch this thing every day february 16th uh 20 23 state surgeon general florida said in the
[01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:18.400]  veirs report which is the vaccine adverse event reporting system showed a 1700 increase in in
[01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:23.840]  these reports now and i'm glad you called because i was going to cover this next segment here it is
[01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:30.480]  dr john cambell elie david reports on it no i know you're talking about reporting on it i'm
[01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:35.840]  the actual the actual report out of out of florida here it does uh breaking today florida surgeon
[01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:41.040]  general issued an official health alert on mRNA COVID vaccine and florida alone there's been a
[01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:47.280]  1700 increase in veirs reports after the release of the COVID vaccine the reporting of the life
[01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:55.280]  threatening conditions increased over 4 400 here is the article health alert on mRNA COVID-19
[01:27:55.280 --> 01:28:02.400]  vaccine safety so yes that is huge one other thing i looked at the various uh their website
[01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:11.120]  and they say that they only get one percent of people giving in these reports only one percent
[01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:17.600]  so you figure if it's only one percent what the 1700 percent would go up if everyone did report it
[01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:24.560]  what would that be what would the number be it's it's it's in the hundreds of thousands yes it's
[01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:29.680]  insane now they're gonna try and by the way just to back you up i know about that that doctor you're
[01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:36.640]  talking about and yeah he used to be pro-vax now he says this is an attack it's on purpose
[01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:40.560]  and he is one of the top people exactly the whole thing's coming in incredible points

[01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:36.480]  with fake clubs because deep fakes are so good is put a clip up that's deceptive about what somebody
[01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:43.920]  said and my phone has been flooded with clips of what i played last hour of friends family other
[01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:50.960]  talk show hosts big ones saying oh my god look at soros endorse the sanis and he didn't endorse the
[01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:57.520]  sanis he said he hopes trump wins the nominations he thinks they can beat trump and i'm not getting
[01:33:57.520 --> 01:34:02.560]  in it with trump or to sanis or who i think is better i like them both overall but he didn't
[01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:08.160]  do that ladies and gentlemen i'm not going to play it again i already played it last hour but
[01:34:08.160 --> 01:34:13.280]  you know we cannot resort to the same disinformation as the system we just cannot
[01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:18.720]  do it ladies and gentlemen all right let's go ahead and go back to your phone calls
[01:34:18.720 --> 01:34:28.160]  jay in kansas on the soros and preparing go ahead do you think that the soros quote-unquote
[01:34:28.160 --> 01:34:34.000]  endorsement is obviously wasn't an endorsement but you think that they're using that for reverse
[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:41.360]  psychology and then also um what's the next biggest threat are we looking at like america and
[01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:47.760]  economic biological infrastructure threat and your top priority for you know homes to prepare
[01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:52.960]  best for that and then the only other question i have is do you have any idea where i can still
[01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:59.520]  find the 2012 gallistan mRNA study i cannot find it anywhere i found it right at the beginning
[01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:07.680]  of this whole hysteria i cannot find it anywhere yeah we even cover that again like three weeks
[01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:14.160]  ago on air i'll have to dig it up but it was uh they did a study of multiple vaccines mRNA and
[01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:24.640]  regular ones for covid sars coronaviruses and they and they found that the rats lived half as long
[01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:32.400]  and and they said do not give this to humans but i mean that's why the cdc knew in 2020 in october
[01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:36.880]  that it would cause all these problems so i mean it's right there i mean i think even more powerful
[01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:42.240]  than that university of texas national initiative that obama had and was big articles about gain
[01:35:42.240 --> 01:35:51.120]  of function with covid sars uh coronaviruses that was in nature uh publication 2015 it was a big
[01:35:51.120 --> 01:36:01.040]  scandals and a bunch of publications but for me even bigger is the october 2020 document that admits
[01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:05.440]  it would do all the things it did do the blood clots the infertility the heart attacks the micro
[01:36:05.440 --> 01:36:10.320]  carditis but i hear you i will look into that what were your first questions it was uh what do you
[01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:16.320]  think the next bio attack is what was the other question well no uh do you think the next um
[01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:22.000]  so like the next threat our next biggest threat do you think it's the america and like the movie
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:27.200]  america and emp do you think it's economic biological i mean obviously we're under all the
[01:36:27.200 --> 01:36:32.800]  you know we're under economic and biological sir i know what they're pre-programming and it's all
[01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:40.320]  of those a new virus marburg uh monkeypox airborne ebola uh they're they're they're they're hyping
[01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:45.520]  power outages they're hyping cyber attacks they're hyping war they're hyping and all i don't know
[01:36:46.080 --> 01:36:48.960]  what the next thing is they're going to kick off because i think they don't know
[01:36:49.520 --> 01:36:53.760]  they're not all powerful they're trying to line things up so i think your guess is as good as mine
[01:36:55.600 --> 01:36:59.920]  okay and then the only other thing i was going to ask was do you think that quote on quote what
[01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:08.320]  they're pushing isn't it soros endorsement for um desantis do you think that may be reverse psychology
[01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:12.560]  like they're yeah that's what i said is i said it could be reverse psychology
[01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:17.520]  but i mean soros is there again in a maccaballion way in the two and a half minute clip not the
[01:37:17.520 --> 01:37:23.120]  32nd one that they're running around he actually endorses trump winning the nomination which is a
[01:37:23.120 --> 01:37:27.280]  repeat of hillary though hillary thought if trump won the nomination she could beat him
[01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:34.000]  and so there is soros kind of repeating that so i don't know i mean again soros is not all
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:39.520]  powerful he doesn't have all the answers and so i mean i think projecting on to him that he knows
[01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:44.640]  what's going on is really not good and i think projecting on to what he said that he endorsed
[01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:50.400]  uh desantis is just not true and again it's not about picking your side with trump desantis i i
[01:37:50.400 --> 01:37:56.640]  still think the jury's out on that it's just that he did not endorse the sanis in that clip
[01:37:56.640 --> 01:38:02.800]  thank you sir all right brett in pennsylvania brett you're on the air hey alex um if i have
[01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:08.560]  time at the end i would like to mention a possible vector for which the bio and tech m r and a gets
[01:38:08.560 --> 01:38:13.520]  is able to splice into human genes but i'm primarily calling to warn about an act of psi op
[01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:20.000]  the rage against the war machine rally in dc has a website it's rage against war dot com well there's
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:26.080]  a rage against war dot org and it is the exact antithesis of it it is a i mean it's something
[01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:33.760]  obviously soros i see alphabet agency to somebody like us it's absurdly ridiculous but it it may be
[01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:38.880]  effective in diverting people away from the peace rally they're literally i'm not familiar with it
[01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:45.600]  i saw harrison covering anti-war anti-nuclear war rally today when i watched like 30 minutes of a
[01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:51.280]  show and i had time uh you're saying there's another fake website diverting people yeah the
[01:38:51.280 --> 01:38:56.080]  real ones dot com theirs is the same thing but dot org and they literally call it a pro russian
[01:38:56.080 --> 01:39:02.720]  anti-peace rally it's absurd to us but normies they might get you know lured in the wrong direction
[01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:06.640]  all right well we'll look into it brother everybody's got to be careful nowadays uh what else is on
[01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:14.160]  your mind um i there's research that i dug up from six months into the pandemic about a possible
[01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:20.320]  vector for how the m r and a in the genes transcribes into human dna it's via the long thin
[01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:27.040]  in short squid um it's it's all technical stuff but this is more something like malone or mike
[01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:34.880]  adam still again too but adar one and adar two are enzymes produced within the squid axon that edit
[01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:40.240]  edit uh edit the rda via m r and s well they now admit that these these these m rna shots edit the
[01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:46.320]  genes not just in the person they're giving it to but generationally yes and um well what they do
[01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:53.280]  essentially is they the anadensine is created by this or enacted upon by this created rna one
[01:39:53.280 --> 01:40:00.720]  which is the ad a adar one which actively inhibits hiv one replication and human and human macrophages
[01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:08.160]  sorry i'm fungtide and human macrophages so it actively inhibits produces the ability for
[01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:12.560]  immunodeficiency disorder well it definitely reduces your immune system and gives you aids
[01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:16.960]  that's mainline news it gives you aids a lot of folks taking the shots now have aids
[01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:21.200]  they call it vades vaccine induced aids and it's all over the news yeah thank you sir
[01:40:21.200 --> 01:40:26.480]  so a lot of folks take the vaccine come up as uh hiv positive they go oh don't worry like oh you
[01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:30.160]  got cancer three years ago when they started the shots in angland two and a half years ago in the
[01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:35.280]  us or a little less than two years two and a half years ago they would say oh a lot of folks have
[01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:40.560]  cancers just ignore those you know you got a cancer it'll probably go away just you know take your
[01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:48.560]  shot savics in seattle you're on the air welcome yes thank you alex i have a suggestion to all the
[01:40:48.560 --> 01:40:54.400]  band that video content creators just like the way john bound us with his special reports
[01:40:55.120 --> 01:41:02.000]  if you have a transcript of that video uh that's already ready to go and if you could post it on
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:08.320]  the description of the video that will help us with the translation aspect of it speed the process up
[01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:14.320]  and no yeah that's a great idea i don't control the hundreds of man dot video contributors we've
[01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:20.480]  got a dozen or so contributors here for info wars but yeah everybody should try to create a transcript
[01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:26.720]  of their voiceover show that people can then what transcribe it or take the transcription
[01:41:26.720 --> 01:41:32.160]  and then what put it over whether it's in chinese or spanish or whatever it is over that so they can
[01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:38.400]  share it easier that's right yeah that's uh that that's when you already have the transcript ready
[01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:42.720]  but that'll that'll be much easier if you don't have the text but if you have it then you could
[01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:47.280]  just post it if it's not if it's possible yes sir i would i can definitely recommend to the
[01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:52.560]  contributors that they created transcript of the video so people can translate it better and share
[01:41:52.560 --> 01:41:58.880]  it that's a great idea anything else that's all we keep waking people up in the spanish speaking
[01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:03.680]  world thank you for the videos and uh just uh keep at it thank you for everything thank you brother

[01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:38.880]  very important the spike protein is loaded in the body with the COVID-19 infection and definitely
[01:46:38.880 --> 01:46:42.880]  with the vaccines people are lower with the spike protein they don't feel well this is a
[01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:49.120]  potential solution hydroxychloroquine comes from a natural substance so does ivermectin and now

[01:47:01.360 --> 01:47:10.640]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[01:47:10.640 --> 01:47:28.560]  what about those who say that's not enough blood to do all the tests that need to be done especially
[01:47:28.560 --> 01:47:32.960]  if someone's very sick and you're trying to figure out what it is every time you create
[01:47:32.960 --> 01:47:38.080]  something new there should be questions and to me that's a sign that you've actually done something
[01:47:38.080 --> 01:47:43.920]  that uh is transformative i asked them to make the impossible possible basic and when we do a
[01:47:43.920 --> 01:47:48.480]  development of vaccine it usually takes 10 years so i asked them instead of eight years to do it in
[01:47:48.480 --> 01:47:53.520]  eight months eight months in a stunning reversal of fortune elizabeth holmes once a silicon valley
[01:47:53.520 --> 01:47:58.720]  superstar was sentenced to more than 11 years in prison on friday holmes carried out a massive scheme
[01:47:58.720 --> 01:48:03.440]  to deceive the investors who put up nearly a billion dollars in her biotech company fairness
[01:48:03.440 --> 01:48:07.600]  along with that there were concerns well they must have cut corners this can't be safe
[01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:11.920]  yes and that was always the guiding principle we will never cut corners
[01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:16.720]  hey there is this seat taken you guys would have been happy it was 50 to 70 percent effective and
[01:48:16.720 --> 01:48:23.120]  it was 95.6 percent the 95.6 all right i'm a Pfizer girl just saying i'm not just saying that
[01:48:23.120 --> 01:48:29.680]  because you're here brought to you by Pfizer have you taken the vaccine sir no i haven't taken it
[01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:33.760]  yet they were developed so quickly what do you tell uh those folks who might be saying well
[01:48:33.760 --> 01:48:38.080]  i'm gonna wait a few months before i get this one the decision not to vaccinate will not affect only
[01:48:38.080 --> 01:48:43.920]  your health or your life unfortunately it will affect the lives of others and likely the lives
[01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:49.040]  of the people you love the most i also want to thank albert borough Pfizer's CEO and chairman
[01:48:49.040 --> 01:48:53.520]  for joining me today we've gotten to know each other the last few months he's really stepped up
[01:48:53.520 --> 01:48:59.920]  at this critical stage you have not yet had uh your shot when do you plan to get it sooner
[01:48:59.920 --> 01:49:08.000]  uh i can i will today's announcement with the u.s. government gets us closer to our goal
[01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:15.280]  you said it was a hundred percent effective then 90 percent then 70 percent 95.6 percent why did you
[01:49:15.280 --> 01:49:20.880]  keep that secret ten nice day is the president i want to thank you for your leadership and
[01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:25.600]  partnership are you not ashamed of what you've done in the last couple years jeffrey apologies to
[01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:30.640]  the public sir of course all of this work to increase supply and distribution will mean nothing
[01:49:31.280 --> 01:49:36.400]  if people are not willing to show up and roll up their sleeves to be vaccinated this is uh
[01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:41.360]  this is the case of life and death
[01:49:41.360 --> 01:49:51.280]  as i said two plus years ago
[01:49:53.120 --> 01:49:58.880]  the therano story run by bill gates she was his front lady the same story here they are bombarding
[01:49:58.880 --> 01:50:05.360]  us with lies and with fraud and i i was thinking during the break unpacking the world government
[01:50:05.360 --> 01:50:09.760]  summit that just ended a few days ago and all the horrible announcements are taking over our bodies
[01:50:09.760 --> 01:50:14.480]  world governments here they're going to run our lives on it's even worse than you'll own nothing
[01:50:14.480 --> 01:50:18.720]  you'll have nothing you'll like it statements these are real statements because they finally
[01:50:18.720 --> 01:50:22.480]  got to attack they finally got to admit what they're doing they finally had to take the gloves off
[01:50:23.920 --> 01:50:29.920]  and it was class 12 they're so scared saying if we don't get this system in we'll lose control
[01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:36.080]  of the ai we'll lose control oh somebody else will get it oh oh we gotta we gotta run it all
[01:50:36.080 --> 01:50:41.120]  or somebody else will but they want to run us they're in control they're trying to get full
[01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:47.440]  control so it's such an illustrative clip of their excuse to total power because if you have freedom
[01:50:48.480 --> 01:50:54.080]  that threatens them so you can't have any freedom so their national conventions against
[01:50:54.080 --> 01:51:00.880]  the ai takeovers or nuclear war nuremberg 2.0 don't make people take shots they do all the evil
[01:51:00.880 --> 01:51:07.360]  that's what Zbigniewczynski wrote in many of his books that oh we do all the evil stuff so we
[01:51:07.360 --> 01:51:12.080]  control the evil to mitigate it that's their excuse and that's their philosophy but really
[01:51:12.080 --> 01:51:20.480]  they are just evil here's a claus robin back to your calls i think the force revolution industrial
[01:51:20.480 --> 01:51:29.280]  revolution will be in our mind for quite some years to come but what is very essential
[01:51:29.280 --> 01:51:39.360]  so my concern my deep concern is that the source technologies if we do not work together on a
[01:51:39.360 --> 01:51:51.680]  global scale if we do not formulate shape together the necessary policies they will escape our power
[01:51:51.680 --> 01:52:00.960]  to master source technology pause they will escape our power to master those technologies
[01:52:01.600 --> 01:52:06.880]  we need a monopoly of technologies we roll out against you for total dominance or somebody
[01:52:06.880 --> 01:52:13.280]  else will get them i've got to be a dictator because somebody else will continue to master
[01:52:13.280 --> 01:52:22.240]  source technologies because artificial intelligence you can it's relatively easy let's say to understand
[01:52:22.880 --> 01:52:29.360]  how a computer functions of course if i go back to the first industrial revolution how a steam
[01:52:29.360 --> 01:52:39.680]  engine functions but how does really quantum computing function how does artificial intelligence
[01:52:39.680 --> 01:52:48.160]  particularly if itself replicating functions so one of my concerns is how to shape the
[01:52:48.160 --> 01:52:54.880]  necessary policies to make sure that source technologies serve humankind they're pausing in
[01:52:55.520 --> 01:53:02.000]  to make sure those technologies serve humankind novell harari is main high priest says humans are
[01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:06.320]  over we're taking your bodies over the government will take you he said two months ago and take
[01:53:06.320 --> 01:53:12.800]  you over to make you accept this oh he wants to serve humanity while he works to replace you
[01:53:12.800 --> 01:53:19.920]  and dumb you down and poison you continue with this this monster second concern which i have
[01:53:20.720 --> 01:53:30.000]  and real governments have an important role so change goes so fast in our world and we go even
[01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:39.280]  faster how can we make sure that the individual each citizen doesn't feel overwhelmed and rolls over
[01:53:39.280 --> 01:53:44.640]  dies because you cannot understand really because you know your future is being destroyed you know
[01:53:44.640 --> 01:53:50.480]  it's anti-human how do we make sure you lay there and die while we kill you if you do not
[01:53:50.480 --> 01:53:57.360]  understand we become fearful and we react negatively and we see the first consequences
[01:53:57.360 --> 01:54:06.720]  already in many countries with polarization of the public opinion it has to do with some feeling
[01:54:06.720 --> 01:54:12.880]  that we lose control over our own fate so give us control we will fix it
[01:54:14.720 --> 01:54:22.640]  james and main globalists and who's at the top go ahead james yes god bless you general
[01:54:22.640 --> 01:54:29.040]  jones it's my honor honor talk to you to speak with you speaking of our friend schwabi there
[01:54:29.040 --> 01:54:34.480]  and bill gates and small roast i was always wondering are they at the top of the pyramid
[01:54:34.480 --> 01:54:38.720]  or are there other people no they're right below the top they are the spokespersons but
[01:54:38.720 --> 01:54:42.800]  essentially they're the enemy i mean they're like generals in a military there's people
[01:54:42.800 --> 01:54:49.120]  behind them but they're they're they're running the operations so is it the jesuit or the zionist
[01:54:49.120 --> 01:54:53.840]  who who's at the top out of all the powerful organizations and groups the globalists have
[01:54:53.840 --> 01:55:02.400]  basically taken them all over gotcha if you look at a roundtable group of the un or the club of
[01:55:02.400 --> 01:55:07.280]  rum or the bill deberg group or debos it's all representational of the leaders of all the main
[01:55:07.280 --> 01:55:13.920]  groups so they've taken over all the main groups they've taken over mainline christianity all of it
[01:55:13.920 --> 01:55:23.360]  okay secondly i just had a quick comment in in the 60s 64 there was a psychiatrist that
[01:55:23.360 --> 01:55:29.200]  started hearing voices in her head and she told her department head and he encouraged her to write
[01:55:29.200 --> 01:55:37.200]  it down and she did so and it turns out that it was jesus speaking to her and she wrote a book
[01:55:37.200 --> 01:55:42.800]  called a course in miracles from these writings and i highly recommend it's a free online book
[01:55:42.800 --> 01:55:48.640]  um you can read it online or get a copy of it it explains our relationship with god
[01:55:48.640 --> 01:55:54.160]  and um it's very valuable i encourage you to check it out and all the listeners to check it out as
[01:55:54.160 --> 01:55:59.040]  well i will brother thank you james let's talk to jordan in new jersey go ahead
[01:56:01.040 --> 01:56:07.280]  hi alex thank you for taking my call thank you um i'm i'm gonna try to be quick uh i put myself
[01:56:07.280 --> 01:56:15.120]  on the timer so um i wanted to uh this is jordan uh from chronize.com um i just wanted to um alert
[01:56:15.120 --> 01:56:21.120]  everybody that um from all the things i've tried to prove through my site and my work um i found
[01:56:21.120 --> 01:56:27.280]  clinical data that proves one thing uh coming from the shots and this is that everybody who
[01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:34.480]  received an active dose of the covid injections received some sort of form of encephalitis um
[01:56:34.480 --> 01:56:40.160]  through the shot that's right that will cause us mad cow they're giving you a prion protein infection
[01:56:41.360 --> 01:56:48.880]  yes and so everybody who's taken this has had effect on their mental capacity um i and and
[01:56:48.880 --> 01:56:54.480]  the clinical data is clear if you put encephalitis and covid-19 vaccine you'll find dozens of
[01:56:54.480 --> 01:57:00.560]  articles these haven't been scrubbed as effectively as some of the heart condition articles and and
[01:57:00.560 --> 01:57:04.960]  so you're right the the the hardest people that have a bigger reaction the main thing is a protein
[01:57:04.960 --> 01:57:11.440]  attack yes and so neurological dysfunction and i think this is long term hold on don't hang up
[01:57:11.440 --> 01:57:15.680]  jordan i'm gonna go to break and give you the floor when we come back in two minutes don't hang

[01:57:54.880 --> 01:58:00.320]  and it is because of licorice and viewers supporting us but when we talk about the
[01:58:00.320 --> 01:58:06.000]  crew at info wars people behind the scenes the researchers the writers they really have
[01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:10.960]  been the mvps in this fight and we look at harrison smith and oh and shroyer and the hard
[01:58:10.960 --> 01:58:18.000]  work they engage in every day five six seven days a week it's really just incredible so for myself

[01:59:59.920 --> 02:00:21.120]  all right this is why i love taking calls because this color is dead on i've talked a lot about
[02:00:21.120 --> 02:00:26.400]  this but not enough we focus on the microcarditis the infertility the blood clots the strokes but
[02:00:26.400 --> 02:00:31.280]  really in all the studies and mainline science he pointed out it hadn't been expunged yet even
[02:00:31.280 --> 02:00:38.640]  from google searches the spongiform encephalopathy the prion disease these proteins are very similar
[02:00:38.640 --> 02:00:43.520]  to self replicating prions they found in mad cow and so that's what they're injecting you with and
[02:00:43.520 --> 02:00:48.720]  for everybody it causes the beginning of these plaques growing in the brain uh this is just so
[02:00:48.720 --> 02:00:53.200]  diabolical so start over with what you're saying is i know what you're saying is true this is so
[02:00:53.200 --> 02:00:59.920]  important thank you alex um so i got into this because my wife put the Moderna vaccine on i saw
[02:00:59.920 --> 02:01:06.080]  strange neurophysical effects immediately and she even admitted that it caused hallucinations
[02:01:06.080 --> 02:01:12.400]  weird things happening auditory hallucinations weird stuff um so that got me started on this
[02:01:12.400 --> 02:01:17.440]  journey and when we talk about all the mind control stuff and all the various things that
[02:01:17.440 --> 02:01:24.880]  that that we've talked about people miss the fact that there has been clinical data dozens of
[02:01:24.880 --> 02:01:32.080]  articles on this um clinical research done by by team of physicians who aren't part of the system
[02:01:32.080 --> 02:01:38.480]  in japan uh in parts of the middle east and and and residents who didn't know not to report this
[02:01:38.480 --> 02:01:43.520]  in american hospitals you can look this up by searching it that encephalitis was one of the key
[02:01:43.520 --> 02:01:48.480]  things that was a side aspect of this but i was just telling the crew to pull this up because
[02:01:48.480 --> 02:01:51.280]  i haven't searched this in months and i should have been focused more on it you've got that
[02:01:51.280 --> 02:01:58.080]  commitment to what do you search uh encephalopathy encephalitis uh connected to vaccine what do
[02:01:58.080 --> 02:02:03.360]  people search right now encephalitis COVID-19 vaccine that's the best way to encephalitis
[02:02:03.360 --> 02:02:11.040]  COVID-19 vaccine okay go and you'll you'll start you'll see dozens of articles uh clinical research
[02:02:11.040 --> 02:02:16.560]  all over the place and various medical journals okay this is what i used to do when i work the
[02:02:16.560 --> 02:02:22.560]  pharmaceutical industry is find stuff like this right so this hasn't been scrubbed as effectively
[02:02:22.560 --> 02:02:28.400]  because everything's been about the myocarditis and all the rest so but you have to realize that
[02:02:28.400 --> 02:02:32.720]  there's a subtle neurological damage that's occurred to everybody's taking this and when
[02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:36.400]  we have these questions about why aren't people waking up and what's wrong with everybody and
[02:02:36.400 --> 02:02:42.720]  things get more bizarre i personally think my my theory based upon my research is that this
[02:02:42.720 --> 02:02:46.960]  has something to do with it kind of like when jfk got hit and then the throat to get him ready for
[02:02:46.960 --> 02:02:52.960]  the kill the head shot this definitely oh no dr. mccullough all of them agree it's directly linked
[02:02:52.960 --> 02:03:02.080]  to prions and so when you go and look encephalitis up on the ni8 site okay it's very serious and
[02:03:02.080 --> 02:03:07.840]  mostly associated with the herpes simplex right but there's clinical data that ties it directly
[02:03:07.840 --> 02:03:15.760]  and in the which is also associated with cancer cancer viruses as yes it can be so there is a
[02:03:15.760 --> 02:03:20.320]  neurological damage that occurred to everybody who took an active dose of this thing so those
[02:03:20.320 --> 02:03:25.280]  people have some sort of form or had a form of encephalitis the long-term neurological effects
[02:03:25.280 --> 02:03:30.800]  which are not being studied and of course to end up every one of these articles it says specifically
[02:03:30.800 --> 02:03:34.400]  oh this is a rare side effect but when you go ahead and count all these articles that your
[02:03:34.400 --> 02:03:39.200]  people can find or anybody can find by searching internet you start to see that it actually then
[02:03:39.200 --> 02:03:45.200]  takes it off the curve trend that they're specifying in these articles and there's been any long term
[02:03:45.200 --> 02:03:51.200]  of studies done because of the state of emergency and all the rest of it and so what i'm saying is
[02:03:51.200 --> 02:03:56.080]  that these people have been neurologically affected and i think most of the people that took this
[02:03:56.080 --> 02:04:03.520]  have some sort of form of you know at least starting what's called semantic dementia which
[02:04:03.520 --> 02:04:08.320]  means that they may appear very normal but there's subtle hints that you may get that these people
[02:04:08.320 --> 02:04:13.280]  aren't thinking correctly you know at first everybody's talking about the brain fog right
[02:04:13.280 --> 02:04:19.280]  and the failure to come to word that's one of the direct symptoms on the nHA site and excuse me
[02:04:19.280 --> 02:04:26.000]  nHA site that's the lightest so and let's be clear the virus of the disease does it as well but
[02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:32.880]  nothing compared to the injections powerful call jordan thank you from new jersey all right jack
[02:04:32.880 --> 02:04:38.880]  possobit is straight ahead he wants to talk about the trainee realm and i can't wait to hear his

[02:06:52.880 --> 02:06:59.840]  he wants to get into the ohio train biden denying federal aid requests so outrageous and then tying

[02:07:13.920 --> 02:07:18.080]  yeah alex thanks so much for having me on i appreciate you uh giving me that that very nice
[02:07:18.080 --> 02:07:22.880]  those nice words there and i also wanted to say congratulations because i i heard yesterday that
[02:07:22.880 --> 02:07:28.400]  you declared that you had accomplished your primary mission and i i posted that snippet
[02:07:28.400 --> 02:07:32.400]  on twitter because that that's actually a huge deal and i think people need to understand that
[02:07:32.400 --> 02:07:36.640]  because you've always had a mission and even when i've spoken with you about this
[02:07:36.640 --> 02:07:43.600]  even even off camera you've always said i have one mission and it's a stop the globalization of world
[02:07:43.600 --> 02:07:49.360]  government and that has been through thick and thin your singular focus your primary mission and
[02:07:49.360 --> 02:07:55.520]  you're absolutely right that that is on the lips of every single world leader they're either talking
[02:07:55.520 --> 02:08:00.080]  for it or they're talking against it but the fact of the matter is this was being done in the shadows
[02:08:00.080 --> 02:08:05.280]  and you i think more than anybody else pulled it into the light and i want to be clear you got it
[02:08:05.280 --> 02:08:10.080]  a lot of folks got it i've assault your post with massive views some said i was saying mission
[02:08:10.080 --> 02:08:15.040]  complete now i'm saying i always felt my mission was trying to get others to put it in the light
[02:08:15.040 --> 02:08:18.800]  so we could have a debate about it we haven't won the war but now we know who the enemy is
[02:08:19.760 --> 02:08:24.240]  that's right that's exactly right alex because this hasn't gone away and you're seeing vestiges
[02:08:24.240 --> 02:08:29.280]  of this everywhere we look right now and just go look at those and i posted some videos from
[02:08:29.280 --> 02:08:36.720]  ohio and it's a great example in fact believe it or not i posted a video of an ohio railroad that's
[02:08:36.720 --> 02:08:43.200]  not in east palestine but it's near east palestine and it shows how uh deconstructed and how run down
[02:08:43.200 --> 02:08:50.000]  the the track is cracked it's twisted it's crooked and i post this video alex within a couple of
[02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:58.400]  hours believe it or not i get a staffer from the imf the international monetary fund sliding into
[02:08:58.400 --> 02:09:04.160]  the comments and my notifications trying to debunk everybody yelling about this because
[02:09:04.160 --> 02:09:08.960]  they're saying wait a minute whoa whoa whoa it doesn't matter what's going on in ohio it doesn't
[02:09:08.960 --> 02:09:13.280]  matter that our infrastructure is crumbling throughout all you there's a video here doesn't
[02:09:13.280 --> 02:09:17.200]  matter that our infrastructure is crumbling across the united states we need to send more money to
[02:09:17.200 --> 02:09:22.000]  ukraine we need to send more money over here don't look at that railroad track don't worry about east
[02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:27.360]  palestine and see alex what's driven them so crazy and the reason that the imf is sending their
[02:09:27.360 --> 02:09:34.160]  stuges against me is because they don't want us talking about the fact that we are living through
[02:09:34.160 --> 02:09:38.720]  the collapse of complex systems they're trying to distract us with spectacle they're trying to
[02:09:38.720 --> 02:09:43.600]  distract us with these pronouncements nicky hailey out there saying uh we need to we need to we need
[02:09:43.600 --> 02:09:48.160]  to win in ukraine we need to win in ukraine and it my heart goes out to them but i'm not from
[02:09:48.160 --> 02:09:52.800]  ukraine i'm not ukrainian i'm an american and i see this happening in my home state of pennsylvania
[02:09:52.800 --> 02:09:57.760]  which east palestine is on the border of i see it happening here in the united states and fema is
[02:09:57.760 --> 02:10:03.840]  nowhere to be found i feel like fema stands for everyone in middle america at this point and the
[02:10:03.840 --> 02:10:09.280]  imf and a lot of these people alex are feeling very threatened because the work that your audience
[02:10:09.280 --> 02:10:13.440]  has done and the work that so many other people have done to highlight these issues and the fact
[02:10:13.440 --> 02:10:21.200]  that the united states has is really been embarking the last 30 years on an america last agenda they
[02:10:21.200 --> 02:10:25.200]  are trying to build and not just i'm not talking about the people of this country i'm talking about
[02:10:25.200 --> 02:10:32.080]  our leaders there and they are embarked on a new plan to build something they call the globalist
[02:10:32.080 --> 02:10:38.240]  american empire and this empire is one that benefits the elites not the people and that is
[02:10:38.240 --> 02:10:45.280]  why they are always talking and and obsessed with places like ukraine and iraq and libya and syria
[02:10:45.280 --> 02:10:49.840]  and they want us to send millions and billions of dollars there and they want us to send thousands
[02:10:49.840 --> 02:10:54.400]  all of our resources and i had seen that footage of all your twitter i hadn't seen i follow your
[02:10:54.400 --> 02:10:58.640]  twitter but i hadn't seen that we have the oldest railways of any industrialized country this has
[02:10:58.640 --> 02:11:03.920]  been done by design all our money all our power sent overseas to parley globalist powers you said
[02:11:03.920 --> 02:11:07.600]  well we're literally rotting and falling apart but you look at that footage of a train having to
[02:11:07.600 --> 02:11:13.440]  drive two miles an hour over the most crooked track ever it is incredible and that that footage
[02:11:13.440 --> 02:11:19.040]  the way we have it that's actually sped up because it's driving so slow that if you showed it without
[02:11:19.040 --> 02:11:23.520]  without it being sped up you wouldn't even see it moving that's that's the united states so remember
[02:11:23.520 --> 02:11:28.160]  that the next time nicky hailey or joe biden or any one of these people are running around telling
[02:11:28.160 --> 02:11:32.240]  us how we have to fix all the problems of the world that we have to go spread gay rights in
[02:11:32.240 --> 02:11:37.760]  hungary because that's a national initiative apparently no how about we actually fix our
[02:11:37.760 --> 02:11:43.040]  country that's crumbling from the inside we're going to stop trains from derailing in places
[02:11:43.040 --> 02:11:49.440]  like ohio because i'm much more worried about that and fixing that up before we can focus on
[02:11:49.440 --> 02:11:56.240]  these other things alex this is why this story beyond the danger to the people that live in the
[02:11:56.240 --> 02:12:04.640]  vicinity it's a massive danger to the globalist writ large because suddenly it's diverted attention
[02:12:04.640 --> 02:12:09.840]  away from where it is supposed to be they don't want people looking at the fact that our railroads
[02:12:09.840 --> 02:12:15.360]  are broken they don't want people asking why the subways in new york city are 120 years old they
[02:12:15.360 --> 02:12:19.280]  don't want to talk about the fact that other countries have bullet trains and maglevs and
[02:12:19.280 --> 02:12:22.880]  everything else and we can't even handle this basic and by the way alex i'll tell you what
[02:12:22.880 --> 02:12:27.200]  they're doing right now the next step and i remember you mentioned this yesterday that we
[02:12:27.200 --> 02:12:30.240]  should always be looking forward for the next step the next step is they're going to say this was
[02:12:30.240 --> 02:12:36.560]  human error and that's why we need more automation we need more ai we need stronger ai this is why
[02:12:36.560 --> 02:12:40.480]  we have to have you know if ai was running the train this would never have happened they are
[02:12:40.480 --> 02:12:46.000]  absolutely going to use this any further push for automation well that's right i've seen some
[02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:50.960]  bad railroad tracks but that clip you put out is just insane about how nothing is done for our
[02:12:50.960 --> 02:12:55.680]  infrastructure but everything is done for globalist investments which they own but it seems like
[02:12:55.680 --> 02:13:02.240]  america's waking up big picture 35 000 foot view with with biden and the sanis and trump and and
[02:13:02.240 --> 02:13:06.800]  the awakening that's happening and elon musk addressing the world government summit saying
[02:13:06.800 --> 02:13:14.400]  world government's bad and authoritarian how do you quantify what's happening well i see it all
[02:13:14.400 --> 02:13:19.200]  you know at elon musk but you also had ian bremer who was out there just after elon musk and
[02:13:19.200 --> 02:13:24.960]  they're out in dubai of course a bastion of of western goodwill and values funny how they they
[02:13:24.960 --> 02:13:31.040]  never want to spread uh you know these lgbt rights and bright flags in in dubai or or katar any of
[02:13:31.040 --> 02:13:34.320]  the other middle eastern countries that the united states has business with but they're more than happy
[02:13:34.320 --> 02:13:39.040]  to push them in places uh like hungary where they have a where they are currently trying to foster
[02:13:39.040 --> 02:13:43.600]  a new color revolution against victor orban and his government you know alex what they're clearly
[02:13:43.600 --> 02:13:48.080]  doing here and if you if you get elon musk's um the guy who comes up after him is ian bremer who's
[02:13:48.080 --> 02:13:52.800]  one of these neoliberal sort of he says we'll use crises to bring in our world government says we
[02:13:52.800 --> 02:13:58.240]  use crisis he said no no no he says all of the crises exactly right alex all of the crises that
[02:13:58.240 --> 02:14:03.520]  we're seeing are because people are trying to break away from globalism because alex there is
[02:14:03.520 --> 02:14:08.320]  something you and i've talked about this in the past that our country was founded on the idea of
[02:14:08.320 --> 02:14:13.920]  breaking away from globalism and being a nation state the globalism of 1776 was something called
[02:14:13.920 --> 02:14:21.120]  the british empire and it was the idea of breaking away from that system and erecting a strong independent
[02:14:21.120 --> 02:14:26.640]  nation state here in our country where we have favorable geography where we've got uh essentially
[02:14:26.640 --> 02:14:31.600]  benign neighbors to our north and south obviously with the cartels right now but we don't have great
[02:14:31.600 --> 02:14:37.360]  powers on our borders we have the ability for the united states to be a place to be this laboratory
[02:14:37.360 --> 02:14:42.080]  and factory of freedom and innovation and it was for so long until it got to the point where we
[02:14:42.080 --> 02:14:49.280]  decided to go and start spreading and encroaching on all of these other nations that's been the
[02:14:49.280 --> 02:14:54.160]  problem where we said we broke away from the globalist system now we're going to erect our own
[02:14:54.160 --> 02:14:58.000]  globalist system and that's where the american experiment if you're wrong alex and i'll tell
[02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:03.120]  you something right now is that we are following in this country the same track because i get people
[02:15:03.120 --> 02:15:07.520]  all the time all the time they say to me oh but you know post so we were founded as a republic
[02:15:07.520 --> 02:15:13.040]  we're a republic don't you know republic guys i know we are founded as a republic but over the
[02:15:13.040 --> 02:15:19.600]  years by design we have been devolving into an empire and i think alex that's what you've been
[02:15:19.600 --> 02:15:24.960]  talking about for these 28 years you've been you've been documenting it in real time how we have been
[02:15:26.320 --> 02:15:32.000]  degenerating this country and these governments into an empire and an empire that doesn't even
[02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:35.360]  serve the people empires are bad enough but at least the roman empire served the people
[02:15:35.360 --> 02:15:39.040]  so i want to talk big picture with jack passobic where we go from here what else is on his radar
[02:15:39.040 --> 02:15:43.520]  screen but he thinks is coming next one the smartest people out there fighting tyranny jack

[02:20:37.920 --> 02:20:42.320]  and the overfinancialization and they called it quantitative eating and all these other things
[02:20:42.320 --> 02:20:48.720]  that went on then so you had all this fresh money in the system and so the the elites had
[02:20:48.720 --> 02:20:54.240]  to find a way to get that money to themselves without too much scrutiny and that's why you see
[02:20:54.240 --> 02:21:00.800]  immediately after this you see the kickoff of libya the destruction of qaddafi's government there
[02:21:00.800 --> 02:21:07.360]  then you saw the united states fund and foment the civil war in syria uh which of course led
[02:21:07.360 --> 02:21:12.800]  later to the inadvertent create creation of isis because we are if you remember arming the
[02:21:12.800 --> 02:21:16.880]  the moderate jihadists he might have never met a i served at guantanamo bay but i never met a
[02:21:16.880 --> 02:21:23.760]  moderate jihadist in my life and we go on and on because alex what they're doing is not necessarily
[02:21:23.760 --> 02:21:27.360]  spreading freedom they'll always say that they're spreading freedom we are the empire we're here
[02:21:27.360 --> 02:21:33.680]  to spread freedom now what they're doing is they're washing the tax basis of the american taxpayer
[02:21:34.480 --> 02:21:41.840]  they're using the u.s dollar and they're using the petrodollar to push beyond any type of actual
[02:21:42.720 --> 02:21:47.200]  value for the u.s dollar and you look at the destruction of nord Nord Stream 2 and cy hearst
[02:21:47.200 --> 02:21:51.200]  has come out with this incredible article right and you would think why would the united states
[02:21:51.200 --> 02:21:56.880]  government ever do something like this ever do something so reckless and attack on a nuclear power
[02:21:56.880 --> 02:22:01.120]  which is also essentially an attack on germany which is another nato member i don't even think
[02:22:01.120 --> 02:22:06.320]  the nato charter discusses what happens if one nato member attacks another nato member at silent
[02:22:06.320 --> 02:22:12.240]  on this but the fact that the imf specifically has come in here alex is indicative for us and it's
[02:22:12.240 --> 02:22:20.640]  enlightening because uh they want us to ask to not ask the questions about what's going on in our
[02:22:20.640 --> 02:22:25.360]  own country they just want us to focus on over here and they don't want you to follow the money
[02:22:25.360 --> 02:22:28.560]  at all they never want you to follow the money you know the french have a phrase they say sure
[02:22:28.560 --> 02:22:34.240]  she left them but in international politics i always say sure she le petrol follow the energy
[02:22:34.240 --> 02:22:41.520]  follow the money follow the petrodollar and you will be amazed at what the globalist american
[02:22:41.520 --> 02:22:46.080]  empire is willing to do when the petrodollar is on the line because united states doesn't make
[02:22:46.080 --> 02:22:50.000]  anything anymore we've outsourced our manufacturing to china we've outsourced our energy supply
[02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:56.000]  to the middle east and instead the united states dollar is only backed by the petrodollar at this
[02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:59.920]  point so the minute if that goes away if united states dollar stops being the world reserve
[02:22:59.920 --> 02:23:05.360]  currency or if china of course because they've learned by watching us china has learned by
[02:23:05.360 --> 02:23:10.000]  watching us debt trap diplomacy becoming the world reserve currency setting up your own
[02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:14.560]  banking system who do you who do you think taught them that right they learn that by watching us
[02:23:14.560 --> 02:23:19.120]  they're doing the exact same things that we have been doing that's why when south africa's
[02:23:19.120 --> 02:23:22.960]  energy grid fails because they're pushing all this critical race theory and these racial
[02:23:22.960 --> 02:23:27.680]  quotas who comes in and bail them all out it's china of course it's always china they're coming
[02:23:27.680 --> 02:23:32.400]  up as a viable threat to the united states well at one level we know the globals are allied with
[02:23:32.400 --> 02:23:36.800]  china but the other level they're fighting with them how do you quantify that split exactly so
[02:23:36.800 --> 02:23:40.640]  what you're seeing is an oligarch fight uh the idea was that they were going to bring china in
[02:23:40.640 --> 02:23:44.000]  and china was going to be it's okay you're going to provide the slave labor you're going to be the
[02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:48.640]  manufacturing base you're going to be the ones that eventually get you know will provide the
[02:23:48.640 --> 02:23:54.320]  intellectual capital the ip the western capital but somewhere along the line the chinese communist
[02:23:54.320 --> 02:23:58.000]  party realized wait a minute if you're sending us all the jobs if you're sending us all the wealth
[02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:02.560]  then you actually need more need us more than we need you so are you the senior partner or the
[02:24:02.560 --> 02:24:05.920]  junior partner that's why you're seeing an oligarch fight now that's why you're seeing
[02:24:05.920 --> 02:24:10.720]  george soros pen opeds attacking shijin ping you didn't care about the united states government
[02:24:10.720 --> 02:24:15.280]  it's about who's in charge it's about who's in the driver's seat the ccp wants to be in the
[02:24:15.280 --> 02:24:19.680]  driver's seat and they don't want to be under the thumb of the globalist elites anymore the western
[02:24:19.680 --> 02:24:23.920]  elites which is what the founders predicted is like a separation of powers in our government
[02:24:23.920 --> 02:24:28.080]  there's a separation of powers globally so so who's winning this global fight right now under
[02:24:28.080 --> 02:24:32.960]  review honestly it's it's china i mean if you look at what happened with the chinese spy balloon
[02:24:32.960 --> 02:24:38.800]  over our nuclear site that was a message and the fact that the united states was not able to defend
[02:24:38.800 --> 02:24:46.720]  was not even able to react until that spy balloon flew over us territory had exited us
[02:24:46.720 --> 02:24:53.680]  territory had it was was off of us soil and we weren't able to respond then joe biden spent the
[02:24:53.680 --> 02:24:58.960]  next week blowing up weather balloons from high school kids that were circumnavigating the globe
[02:24:58.960 --> 02:25:05.280]  like mcjellen a true hero by the way as you've always said that they were just lying to us they
[02:25:05.280 --> 02:25:10.560]  were sending up f-22 fighters to go after weather balloons and pretending like they were fighting
[02:25:10.560 --> 02:25:17.120]  aliens to try to play to they want you so desperate they want you conditioned and programmed so that
[02:25:17.120 --> 02:25:21.920]  you will agree to your own destruction that's what this is about this is about you thinking that
[02:25:21.920 --> 02:25:26.640]  it's top gun and actually falling for it when at the end of the day they're shooting at nothing
[02:25:26.640 --> 02:25:31.840]  they're shooting at 40 000 missiles at a 13 dollar balloon and telling you that they're you know that
[02:25:31.840 --> 02:25:36.720]  it's uh you know it's independence day again now the entire thing is theater this is conditioning
[02:25:36.720 --> 02:25:42.960]  this is programming you have to use the mind that christ gave you to see with your eyes to look at
[02:25:42.960 --> 02:25:48.000]  what's actually going on in this country and in our world that's why they don't want you talking
[02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:52.160]  about ohio that's why they're currently looking for a scapegoat in ohio they're gonna try to blame
[02:25:52.960 --> 02:25:56.400]  capitalism they're gonna try to blame trump they're gonna blame nationalists they're going to
[02:25:56.400 --> 02:26:01.120]  blame uh the company they're gonna blame anything they can but themselves i was about to say why
[02:26:01.120 --> 02:26:08.080]  wouldn't us obama slash biden send federal aid to this why would he do that i think it caught them
[02:26:08.080 --> 02:26:13.040]  all flat-footed honestly i think it caught them completely flat-footed in terms of this um you're
[02:26:13.040 --> 02:26:17.280]  seeing people make distinctions and make their declarations before they actually have the ability
[02:26:17.280 --> 02:26:21.600]  to come out here but i'll tell you something else that at the end of the day they're going full
[02:26:21.600 --> 02:26:27.440]  mask off what you just saw here was a mask off moment from the globalist american empire essentially
[02:26:27.440 --> 02:26:31.520]  saying what i said before if you're from the middle of this country if you're someone who's from the
[02:26:31.520 --> 02:26:36.240]  midwest or the south or the what you know this is the rust belt alex this is the exact rust belt
[02:26:36.240 --> 02:26:40.800]  that we've been talking about for so long exactly why president trump won in 2016 because these are
[02:26:40.800 --> 02:26:45.440]  the people who were forgotten about these are the people who are taking granted for these are the
[02:26:45.440 --> 02:26:50.000]  people that work the jobs their families go into the military they go to pray at church now you're
[02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:54.400]  totally right so why does the eastern elite don't matter why does the eastern elite instinctively
[02:26:54.400 --> 02:26:58.960]  hate men westerners and uh and southerners and others why why why hate people that are the source
[02:26:58.960 --> 02:27:05.520]  of their power because at the end because two reasons alex number one because of massive cultural
[02:27:05.520 --> 02:27:12.880]  differences uh they'll wear the maga hats they'll go listen to country music they they drink beer and
[02:27:12.880 --> 02:27:19.280]  they cuss and maybe every once in a while they have a rebel flag oh no uh the idea that they
[02:27:19.280 --> 02:27:24.800]  would ever stoop to such a level they're elitist alex they view these people as scum they view
[02:27:24.800 --> 02:27:31.120]  them as the people who as waiters as servants and as peasants and they don't want the peasants to be
[02:27:31.120 --> 02:27:35.200]  riled up so they'll they'll put some playcation out there they're scared of the ghost of america
[02:27:35.200 --> 02:27:38.720]  which doesn't matter whether you're in new mexico california new york doesn't matter you're an
[02:27:38.720 --> 02:27:43.120]  american black white old young you accept that birthright you're that but they're really scared
[02:27:43.120 --> 02:27:49.520]  of the american ghosts they're terrified because they know that if the people of this country
[02:27:49.520 --> 02:27:55.360]  actually do have their eyes opened up they stop going in to serve in all these endless wars they
[02:27:55.360 --> 02:28:01.200]  stop going in with every single new government action overseas and start asking questions
[02:28:01.200 --> 02:28:06.400]  about why is the government allowing our water to be poisoned why is the government allowing
[02:28:06.400 --> 02:28:10.640]  our air to be poisoned why are you going after a guy like mike lindell who all he does is make
[02:28:10.640 --> 02:28:16.640]  pillows to give everyone a good night's sleep so hard just for asking these questions alex
[02:28:16.640 --> 02:28:21.200]  they're terrified because they know at the end of the day that there are so much so many more
[02:28:21.200 --> 02:28:26.240]  of us than there are of them and they don't people wanting to wake up to use their agency
[02:28:26.240 --> 02:28:31.200]  and to actually find their inner human american spirit well that's right everybody's great from
[02:28:31.200 --> 02:28:36.480]  florida new york to washington state but it really is the midwesterners look at look at lindell they
[02:28:36.480 --> 02:28:40.800]  just hate those common nice friendly people that aren't trying to be elitists they're scared of

[02:35:17.520 --> 02:35:23.680]  order but then they put the hammer to us over the last four five six years they have gotten so close
[02:35:23.680 --> 02:35:28.880]  to shutting us down which is fine because that makes us only that much more intense in the fight
[02:35:28.880 --> 02:35:34.960]  but i'm completely maxed out i have a hundred thousand dollars legal bills a month with multiple
[02:35:34.960 --> 02:35:41.360]  appeals and bankruptcy and all the rest of but we're winning despite that so as soon as i get
[02:35:41.360 --> 02:35:46.320]  back into black i have a tendency to kind of back off the plugs and pushing product because i don't
[02:35:46.320 --> 02:35:50.080]  want to cover that i want to you know the great products that enrich our lives i want to take
[02:35:50.080 --> 02:35:57.520]  your calls i want to have guests on i want to cover news but something that got us the last two
[02:35:57.520 --> 02:36:04.560]  months out of the red was me not just sitting there plugging products and explaining how great
[02:36:04.560 --> 02:36:10.560]  they are it was where i explained to people you know less than one percent of the viewers ever
[02:36:10.560 --> 02:36:15.760]  buy a product at infowarstore.com so if all of you will just have your heart convicted to get great
[02:36:15.760 --> 02:36:22.480]  products at the same time and go to infowarstore.com and become a customer we won't have any problems
[02:36:22.480 --> 02:36:27.680]  we can defeat all of this but god keeps me hungry and always keeps you right there on the edge
[02:36:28.800 --> 02:36:33.520]  so i'm asking listeners you can only make this decision i'm asking you to make this decision
[02:36:33.520 --> 02:36:39.200]  right now to go to infowarstore.com you know i was thinking of that movie gladiator just a few
[02:36:39.200 --> 02:36:43.520]  minutes ago and i asked the crew during the break to pull it up we'll see if they can but there's
[02:36:43.520 --> 02:36:51.600]  that scene where they send the roman general out who's been captured and put in a gladiatorial
[02:36:51.600 --> 02:36:56.160]  service they don't know who he is and he goes out there and he cuts up like five guys in about
[02:36:56.160 --> 02:37:03.280]  30 seconds and he says are you not entertained well i'm not comparing myself to some fictional
[02:37:03.280 --> 02:37:12.080]  hollywood movie i'm saying are you not empowered because what we've done the listeners the guests
[02:37:12.080 --> 02:37:20.720]  the crew is beyond that scene i mean we have hacked the living murderous daylights out of the
[02:37:20.720 --> 02:37:25.360]  new old order they are so damn afraid of us because they're afraid of god god's like shines
[02:37:25.360 --> 02:37:30.720]  through us i'm not here like oh i'm badass i'm incredible man no i'm completely humble on my
[02:37:30.720 --> 02:37:41.920]  knees in front of god but i got god on my side and and they are so scared and later the former
[02:37:41.920 --> 02:37:46.640]  top gladiator who's retired one of the few that survives and you know becomes a rich man
[02:37:46.640 --> 02:37:50.800]  who runs the gladiatory operation he goes listen you gotta draw it out when you're so good you
[02:37:50.800 --> 02:37:55.200]  gotta you gotta you gotta you gotta make them love you well we're not trying to do that here

[02:38:55.840 --> 02:39:00.720]  allegory of what we've done we're not just hacking folks up for sport or entertainment we're hacking
[02:39:00.720 --> 02:39:06.720]  globalist culturally spiritually politically up and saying are you not empowered have we not
[02:39:06.720 --> 02:39:18.720]  delivered here it is
[02:39:36.720 --> 02:39:48.720]  uh
[02:39:59.520 --> 02:40:03.200]  are you not entertained are you not entertained
[02:40:03.200 --> 02:40:07.200]  is this not why you were here
[02:40:16.480 --> 02:40:22.080]  so you want somebody to fight for you you want somebody to go 110 percent you want somebody
[02:40:22.080 --> 02:40:26.800]  to give you victory god's gonna give you that you're gonna give yourself that and there's
[02:40:26.800 --> 02:40:33.280]  nowhere in a war against tyranny that more intense war is happening we are in the center of the war
[02:40:33.280 --> 02:40:41.120]  and i am beyond blessed to be here but i'll tell you i get it's god's god's way of doing things
[02:40:41.120 --> 02:40:47.760]  lord works in serious ways to humble me and to make me spend five six hours a day running around
[02:40:47.760 --> 02:40:52.720]  for money to run this place when i could be cutting reports and doing everything else
[02:40:52.720 --> 02:40:57.840]  and and and and and it's it's disgusting and i'm not bitching
[02:40:59.760 --> 02:41:04.240]  but i know all this big money sits off on the side right there and just sits back and says
[02:41:04.240 --> 02:41:08.480]  oh that guy's too much in the arena he's too spotlighted heal you support him they'll come
[02:41:08.480 --> 02:41:14.640]  after you they're coming after everybody why the hell do we sit here and take this
[02:41:14.640 --> 02:41:24.800]  this we wake up we say no like that clip for the movie ants where they go we got plenty of grain
[02:41:24.800 --> 02:41:28.720]  in the head grasshoppers ass we got plenty of grain why are we beating these ants up he says
[02:41:28.720 --> 02:41:32.800]  if you let one ant stand up they might all stand up
[02:41:35.760 --> 02:41:41.040]  i know we're gonna win i bet on you because i bet on myself i know you're just like me
[02:41:41.040 --> 02:41:46.320]  but dammit folks make the commitment however you can to share the articles in the videos
[02:41:46.320 --> 02:41:50.720]  on your email your text message however you can on rumble on on patreon sites but also

[02:41:55.680 --> 02:42:00.960]  clout swabs body language and everything he said is fear and he should be afraid of god
[02:42:02.400 --> 02:42:07.600]  but we can't sit back and ask god to do it when we are the instruments of god and god works
[02:42:07.600 --> 02:42:14.320]  through men and women should go now to infowarstore.com go to the top where it says donate support

[02:43:03.920 --> 02:43:10.000]  and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us when we talk about the crew at info
[02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:16.400]  wars people behind the scenes the researchers the writers they really have been the mvps in this
[02:43:16.400 --> 02:43:22.000]  fight and we look at harrison smith and oh and shroyer and the hard work they engage in every day

[02:44:14.640 --> 02:44:20.480]  and it's the same psi op today info wars is more influential and more powerful than ever because

[02:47:59.120 --> 02:48:04.880]  me hey alex i was just calling to tell you how much we love you and buying your product
[02:48:04.880 --> 02:48:11.040]  we're supporting the info war and i had an idea for a t-shirt for you tell me um rage against the
[02:48:11.040 --> 02:48:21.520]  vaccine oh that's beautiful so um i in stickers too that'd be really awesome i uh i started listening
[02:48:21.520 --> 02:48:29.440]  to you in summer of 2021 oddly my daughter was damaged by a flu vaccine back in 2013 and i think
[02:48:29.440 --> 02:48:33.200]  that was the beginning of my awakening i'm not sure why i never listened to you because i was a huge
[02:48:33.840 --> 02:48:41.280]  ram paul fan but i just never i never really watched you so um now i feel like uh all those
[02:48:41.280 --> 02:48:47.920]  pieces of the puzzle are missing um it's a shame that my daughter uh was damaged but i can see how
[02:48:47.920 --> 02:48:54.800]  god i'm sorry to hear that is she doing better she's better she has she has autism she had autism
[02:48:54.800 --> 02:49:03.920]  before the injury but um she's um you know it's just a daily it's a daily struggle with her but
[02:49:03.920 --> 02:49:08.080]  she's been doing well for the last few months so we just thank god every day for that so
[02:49:10.480 --> 02:49:14.080]  but i am thankful that it really made me even before i started listening to you
[02:49:14.080 --> 02:49:20.560]  i uh it was 2020 and i had a co-worker come in and we were packing up our offices for the
[02:49:20.560 --> 02:49:26.320]  lockdowns and i told my co-worker i said this is what's gonna happen i said they're going to make
[02:49:26.320 --> 02:49:33.040]  a vaccine they're going to rush it and i'm not gonna take it and um i i hadn't even listened to you
[02:49:33.600 --> 02:49:39.280]  which is so strange but i just knew no you spiritually knew yeah i spiritually knew um
[02:49:39.280 --> 02:49:43.440]  after that pain of seeing my daughter when she was six years old have to be hospitalized
[02:49:43.440 --> 02:49:49.360]  because she tried to choke her sister um her baby sister after this vaccine she went completely
[02:49:49.360 --> 02:49:56.880]  psychotic and um i'm just so thankful that uh while that was painful i'm thankful that i was able to
[02:49:57.840 --> 02:50:04.400]  resist it for my family now and um for a few of my co-workers the few of us who stood
[02:50:05.040 --> 02:50:11.840]  and and resisted it and even though you know we i work for big tech so it was rough but um well
[02:50:11.840 --> 02:50:15.360]  i'm just thankful your call got through to tell this testimony so hopefully others think about
[02:50:15.360 --> 02:50:19.200]  what they're doing i know so many people took these mRNA shots that aren't the same now they're
[02:50:19.200 --> 02:50:27.040]  like their IQ goes down 30 40 points yeah it's it's terrifying and um it was very terrifying
[02:50:27.040 --> 02:50:32.800]  because um i support my children my three daughters and i was so terrified i actually
[02:50:33.520 --> 02:50:38.800]  because my co-workers i work in a very liberal environment they wanted everyone fired who would
[02:50:38.800 --> 02:50:45.440]  not comply and i was so scared i wasn't going to be able to um provide for my children and um
[02:50:46.240 --> 02:50:50.320]  i ended up getting i ended up getting an exemption because i got an attorney
[02:50:50.320 --> 02:50:55.440]  who wrote a beautiful letter and um i got an exemption for me and a few other co-workers
[02:50:55.440 --> 02:50:58.880]  but i ended up moving company that paid me more and they never mandated the vaccine
[02:50:59.520 --> 02:51:05.120]  and just that um i just want to tell everyone um if you are courageous you have to make a
[02:51:05.120 --> 02:51:10.880]  decision to be courageous and god will take care of you and and we're going to lose everything
[02:51:10.880 --> 02:51:14.960]  anyways if we don't but you're right in that moment where you don't know just trust in god
[02:51:14.960 --> 02:51:20.160]  take action beautiful call sarah thank you so much thank you so much beautiful call daryl in

[02:53:26.080 --> 02:53:30.480]  can get people to maybe call in but it seems like it's taking off right now but i just wanted to
[02:53:30.480 --> 02:53:34.720]  give the good news because man look at that stack of paper on your desk you're a hundred sheets of
[02:53:34.720 --> 02:53:39.440]  bad news we've been seeing it we're all getting walloped now i almost feel guilty that i cover
[02:53:39.440 --> 02:53:42.560]  what the enemy's doing instead of the positive you're right i'm trying i'm trying to i just want
[02:53:42.560 --> 02:53:46.720]  to tell you what's happening but yeah we should focus more on the positive you know maybe sunday

[02:53:51.600 --> 02:53:58.080]  out of kentucky let's do it brother but make it happen thank you darrell love you brad in missouri
[02:53:58.080 --> 02:54:03.920]  you're on the air go ahead hey alexa long time listener first time caller in the year sure sure
[02:54:03.920 --> 02:54:09.360]  year so i gotta talk to uh oh one a couple times but uh my reason why i was calling is i want to ask
[02:54:09.360 --> 02:54:16.160]  your opinion on the climate lockdowns i think that all these chemical spills and everything going on
[02:54:16.160 --> 02:54:20.160]  around the country all at one time it's not an accident everything i think they're gonna lock
[02:54:20.160 --> 02:54:26.480]  us down again arizona is already in trouble so no i mean i don't think it's i mean they admit
[02:54:26.480 --> 02:54:33.600]  it's record level uh disasters in the u.s so do you think they're gonna try to put us into a climate
[02:54:33.600 --> 02:54:39.280]  lockdown i just think they're trying to shut down society and not let us know we're under attack it's
[02:54:39.280 --> 02:54:46.640]  a covert covert war yeah i mean arizona's been a lockdown for like four days over the nitric acid
[02:54:46.640 --> 02:54:51.440]  they got released i'm thinking about the ohio disasters killing all the animals and then you
[02:54:51.440 --> 02:54:56.320]  got this chemical plant fire down in florida and then you got all these well that stuff's all going
[02:54:56.320 --> 02:55:01.360]  on but i think they're also focusing on balloons and chemical fires and stuff that's already happening
[02:55:01.360 --> 02:55:07.840]  to divert us from uh the the jeffrey epstein information coming out and the pipeline uh
[02:55:07.840 --> 02:55:13.360]  in in uh europe being blown up and and the war so i think the media is focusing us in on that
[02:55:13.360 --> 02:55:20.560]  thanks for the call let's go to shon in florida shon go ahead hey alex so i've noticed that you've
[02:55:20.560 --> 02:55:27.760]  been asking a lot of people how to beat the globalists and nobody really has a sufficient answer
[02:55:28.480 --> 02:55:36.000]  what i've come up with is traditional americanism and what that looks like is local organization
[02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:40.560]  so solve problems locally as much as you can before you kick it to a higher power like state
[02:55:40.560 --> 02:55:48.320]  regional federal but also repealing both the 16th and 17th amendments and for those who don't know
[02:55:48.320 --> 02:55:54.320]  16th amendment allows the federal government to directly tax the population the 17th amendment
[02:55:54.320 --> 02:55:59.760]  allows for the direct election of senators those are both strictly forbidden in the original
[02:55:59.760 --> 02:56:06.480]  thicker constitution yes but what this does yeah we should go back pre 1913 when they passed the irs
[02:56:06.480 --> 02:56:15.840]  and made federal senators federal i agree with you so what this does is well put it this way
[02:56:15.840 --> 02:56:20.160]  before the federal government used to be funded by the states but now the states most of their
[02:56:20.160 --> 02:56:25.680]  budgets especially the smaller states come from the federal government so if you repeal both of
[02:56:25.680 --> 02:56:33.760]  these amendments it allows the tail will no longer be wagging the dog yeah so senators would be fired
[02:56:33.760 --> 02:56:39.280]  if they kept giving money to the federal government this means it's not as easy to go to war fund
[02:56:39.280 --> 02:56:45.280]  bio weapons to allow infrastructure to rot and just fund and enforce their agenda because senators
[02:56:45.280 --> 02:56:50.640]  are creatures of the legislatures that elect them house members are popular elected senate members
[02:56:50.640 --> 02:56:56.960]  are elected by legislatures now they are creatures of the states so you don't get an imperium yeah
[02:56:56.960 --> 02:57:03.120]  and it also allows the states to follow their own agendas so that makes them forces them to
[02:57:03.120 --> 02:57:08.800]  cooperate with each other more and instead of this like adversarial relationship they have now
[02:57:08.800 --> 02:57:14.400]  because they're lobbying for federal dollars the original globalist coup over america was in 1913
[02:57:14.400 --> 02:57:21.840]  with the irs and the income tax system and the senators being popularly elected to congress you
[02:57:21.840 --> 02:57:29.040]  are dead on like a flaming torpedo we're gonna go to break come back with a few final calls from hb

[03:00:23.040 --> 03:00:28.160]  summer the international health regulations uh and the world health organization might pass
[03:00:28.160 --> 03:00:32.480]  amendments that basically take away our sovereignty and let the world health organization tell us when
[03:00:32.480 --> 03:00:37.680]  we have a national uh a international health crisis they're bringing in their world government on the
[03:00:37.680 --> 03:00:44.160]  back of a virus the quickening is happening we are quickly approaching the point of no return
[03:00:44.160 --> 03:00:49.840]  we might need a project valkyrie to be in the uh background here we should we need to talk to the
[03:00:50.720 --> 03:00:54.560]  the guards we need to talk to the secret service we need to talk to the people that are guarding
[03:00:54.560 --> 03:00:59.200]  all these criminals that are running our country and say what do you think should happen here should
[03:00:59.200 --> 03:01:04.000]  we keep going down this road or is there a peaceful way to get out of this you're changing the 13th
[03:01:04.000 --> 03:01:09.680]  and the 16th and 17th amendment isn't going to change things in time we're we're uh we're heading
[03:01:09.680 --> 03:01:15.120]  down a road to ruin pretty quick here i meant to cover marburg today i did cover some yesterday but
[03:01:15.120 --> 03:01:20.480]  yeah bbc u n they're all oh it kills 90 percent of people it's out we're all dead they're they're
[03:01:20.480 --> 03:01:26.880]  literally hyping the next plague right now yep and that just gives them more control it's like
[03:01:26.880 --> 03:01:30.240]  the mask thing with wilinski saying we're never going to get rid of the masks on the children
[03:01:30.240 --> 03:01:34.160]  it's just a matter of how much testing indicates we have disease in the in the community that then
[03:01:34.160 --> 03:01:38.160]  we can put the mask back on the school children again forever we're never going to change that
[03:01:38.160 --> 03:01:43.520]  rule so they're never giving up on this covid medical tyranny they're just letting it go by
[03:01:43.520 --> 03:01:48.000]  the wayside briefly and then they bring it back every time there's another outbreak of something
[03:01:48.000 --> 03:01:54.080]  absolutely i totally agree with you so how do we counter it well i can say it you know we've
[03:01:54.080 --> 03:02:01.600]  woken up enough people i think uh i don't know how we expand the audience larger quickly in the
[03:02:01.600 --> 03:02:05.920]  sense to get everybody on the same team but certainly uh the people that are closest to the elite
[03:02:05.920 --> 03:02:11.360]  need to be uh consulted as to whether they're willing to go down this well i think ilan must
[03:02:11.360 --> 03:02:14.480]  get a lot of them get it now that's why we're seeing major challenges at the world government
[03:02:14.480 --> 03:02:19.200]  forum but yeah i appreciate your call i think it's work we did decades ago is now having its effect
[03:02:19.200 --> 03:02:23.920]  the work we do now have an effect in the future but it's it's how this stuff works uh let's go
[03:02:23.920 --> 03:02:28.960]  ahead and go to marvin and then hb marvin let's talk about trump disdain is in the soros situation
[03:02:28.960 --> 03:02:34.960]  go ahead yeah hey alec yeah i don't think uh either one of those guys are gonna save us
[03:02:34.960 --> 03:02:39.040]  you know so i don't really care too much about what soros said exactly trump and soros
[03:02:39.840 --> 03:02:45.520]  trump disdain is aren't gonna save us yeah no way and uh i mean they both have so many problems
[03:02:45.520 --> 03:02:52.000]  and so and we know that if uh you know in the bible it talks about how saul on the road to
[03:02:52.000 --> 03:02:57.440]  demascus and jesus appeared to him and said why are you persecuting me well the reason he said me
[03:02:57.440 --> 03:03:03.360]  is because where where his body and if if where his body on earth than the antichrist also has
[03:03:03.360 --> 03:03:10.080]  a body a spirit of antichrist and those people are doing the best they can to to you know when
[03:03:10.080 --> 03:03:16.160]  they're war right now and you look at ohio people aren't really you know looking at things the way
[03:03:16.160 --> 03:03:23.280]  they could where uh how do you cover up mass cancers and heart problems caused by the jab
[03:03:23.280 --> 03:03:28.800]  that can't be hidden very much you know the giant war you release well or you release chemicals
[03:03:28.800 --> 03:03:33.840]  into the atmosphere and to the ground that cause the same problems and so you can you know i agree
[03:03:33.840 --> 03:03:38.880]  they're gonna cover up their first attack with a new attack well they did it i mean they did it
[03:03:38.880 --> 03:03:44.160]  in ohio and some of these train derailments are decoys and some are the real deal they're gonna
[03:03:44.160 --> 03:03:48.560]  cause a lot of health problems and things like that so people need to kind of think about and
[03:03:48.560 --> 03:03:52.800]  even this morning on harrison show you know and i recommend everybody listen to that every morning
[03:03:52.800 --> 03:03:59.280]  it's a great show uh you know he had a caller talk about how they changed the uh poison levels
[03:03:59.280 --> 03:04:05.280]  of the vinyl chloride and they raised the you know limits on it well now they could you know with
[03:04:05.280 --> 03:04:10.000]  all the chemtrails and everything they could spray just under that limit and give everybody that
[03:04:10.000 --> 03:04:15.280]  took the shot uh arrhythmias in their hearts and nobody would detect it because they're looking for
[03:04:15.280 --> 03:04:19.760]  a higher limit you know so people really need to think about what's going on and not put all
[03:04:19.760 --> 03:04:28.000]  their faith in trump or desantis uh i 100 agree marvin sorry to hb and rob or bob if you guys call

[03:06:06.640 --> 03:06:13.680]  shouts into telephones and men with guns will be on their way it's chances that damn it why because
[03:06:13.680 --> 03:06:20.560]  while the truncheon may be used lieu of conversation words will always retain their power words are
[03:06:20.560 --> 03:06:27.760]  for the means to meaning and for those who will listen the enunciation of the truth there is
[03:06:27.760 --> 03:06:32.960]  something terribly wrong with this country isn't that you decided sir you wanted it foolproof you
[03:06:32.960 --> 03:06:38.560]  told me every television and longer cruelty and injustice intolerance and depression and where
[03:06:38.560 --> 03:06:43.200]  once you have the freedom to object listen to the thing can speak as you saw fit you now have
[03:06:43.200 --> 03:06:49.200]  sensors and systems of surveillance perwessing your conformity and serve your submachine cameras
[03:06:49.200 --> 03:06:55.440]  how did this happen most blame well certainly there are those who are more responsible than others
[03:06:55.440 --> 03:07:01.440]  they will be held accountable but again truth be told if you're looking for the guilty you need
[03:07:01.440 --> 03:07:10.240]  only look into a mirror i know why you did it i know you were afraid who wouldn't be war terror
[03:07:10.240 --> 03:07:16.960]  disease there were a myriad probably inspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common
[03:07:16.960 --> 03:07:23.680]  sense fear got the best of you and in your panic you turn to the now high chancellor adam satla
[03:07:24.240 --> 03:07:29.200]  he promised you border he promised you peace and all he demanded in return was your silent
[03:07:29.200 --> 03:07:43.520]  obedient consent there is a war it's happening now it will decide the fate of humanity the time
[03:07:43.520 --> 03:07:49.440]  the true science has come we are the resistance we are the info war
[03:07:49.440 --> 03:07:57.280]  welcome back to the oxygen show i'm your guest host j dire
[03:07:57.280 --> 03:08:01.680]  days analysis and i thought today for this fourth hour so glad to be here in studio
[03:08:01.680 --> 03:08:06.640]  that we could cover some of the predictive programming because of course i've written
[03:08:06.640 --> 03:08:12.320]  two books on that topic and it's really relevant given the fact that this film white noise based
[03:08:12.320 --> 03:08:21.200]  on a don delilo novel is so precious so specific and i think that definitely bears our you know
[03:08:21.200 --> 03:08:25.360]  covering that that we should we should focus on that because this is an idea that i think
[03:08:25.360 --> 03:08:29.120]  trips up a lot of people and people don't think this is a real thing they can't conceive of why
[03:08:29.120 --> 03:08:33.760]  this would exist why there'd be such a thing and i think there's multiple reasons multiple
[03:08:33.760 --> 03:08:37.840]  multiple layers and explanations for this no later we'll get to some clips from the
[03:08:37.840 --> 03:08:42.960]  w e f itself that i think outlines the whole agenda so you can hear it from their own mouths from
[03:08:42.960 --> 03:08:50.880]  their own uh uh slimy slithery snakemouth mouths uh coming coming through their fork tongues um
[03:08:51.840 --> 03:08:56.720]  so let's talk about this this uh white noise okay so we watch this we do a lot of film analyses a
[03:08:56.720 --> 03:09:00.960]  lot of breakdowns because there's so much uh propaganda so much programming in the fiction in
[03:09:00.960 --> 03:09:05.120]  in the film white noise which is based on this novel as we said and by the way i should mention
[03:09:05.120 --> 03:09:09.920]  even the la times has recovered the fact that don delilo's novels have had a history
[03:09:09.920 --> 03:09:15.840]  of predicting the future there's a la times write up about delilo predicting something like
[03:09:15.840 --> 03:09:20.720]  the coof covid how is this in fiction well this goes all the way back to the british empire they
[03:09:20.720 --> 03:09:26.160]  had a tendency to put into a lot of the spy fiction what they were going to do what the future plans
[03:09:26.160 --> 03:09:31.120]  would be it's a form of revelation of the method if you heard gegris's uh excellent report we talked
[03:09:31.120 --> 03:09:36.720]  about the strategy of sort of conditioning warming people up to the acceptance of these things
[03:09:36.720 --> 03:09:41.280]  when they're rolled out and fiction is an amazing technique for doing that in fact it's a lot better
[03:09:41.280 --> 03:09:46.240]  than the news you know nobody really cares what boring newscasters are saying but billions of
[03:09:46.240 --> 03:09:51.280]  people perhaps might watch or read something that's a fictional presentation so it's a lot better
[03:09:51.280 --> 03:09:57.280]  means for programming and for conditioning people think about hc wells the the famous uh
[03:09:57.280 --> 03:10:03.760]  bernays before bernays right in hg wells fiction he's a he's basically ceding a lot of the ideas of
[03:10:03.760 --> 03:10:08.640]  what the elite what the fabian society what the new world order wanted to bring in decades ahead
[03:10:08.640 --> 03:10:14.240]  of time and he was very effective at that through the usage of fiction so you watch world of the
[03:10:14.240 --> 03:10:20.800]  worlds you watch uh you know island of dr morrow it's about g m o's human modification creating
[03:10:20.800 --> 03:10:26.960]  hybrids all this kind of stuff all this changing of the the genome and nature that's already in hg
[03:10:26.960 --> 03:10:32.800]  wells a long time ago and so he was able to condition generations of people through fiction
[03:10:32.800 --> 03:10:37.120]  and he understood that and then later people in hollywood for example they understood the power
[03:10:37.120 --> 03:10:44.160]  fiction to do this in an amazing way beyond what you could do in uh boring sort of rote newscast
[03:10:45.040 --> 03:10:51.600]  now in this novel we have the story of a train that derails in the exact same city uh that's the
[03:10:51.600 --> 03:10:57.680]  actual derailment took place recently and not only that the film itself when you watch the film
[03:10:57.680 --> 03:11:02.640]  i've not read this novel but i've had some uh literary theorists on who do talk about uh this
[03:11:02.640 --> 03:11:06.960]  novel and who are sort of experts in delilo's writings he has a bunch of books that cover these
[03:11:06.960 --> 03:11:11.840]  topics and even the the literary theorists that i've had on my show my podcast we've talked about
[03:11:12.560 --> 03:11:16.960]  the predictive elements in his fiction and what might be going on here now i don't know anything
[03:11:16.960 --> 03:11:21.520]  about his own background i'm not making accusations about the author we don't know about that but
[03:11:21.520 --> 03:11:25.920]  what is interesting is that people can in the arts kind of make connections at times that
[03:11:25.920 --> 03:11:31.440]  i think go beyond just the mundane and again let's talk about some of those possibilities to as to
[03:11:31.440 --> 03:11:37.520]  what these fictional presentations might be about in my view i think there's something deep going on
[03:11:37.520 --> 03:11:43.040]  with the way that psychological warfare experts have studied the human psyche and how to condition
[03:11:43.040 --> 03:11:48.720]  and how to prepare and entrain or entrainment as katharine also fits calls it through fiction
[03:11:48.720 --> 03:11:53.600]  the preparation for what they want to roll out so there's just one aspect of it which is that
[03:11:53.600 --> 03:11:58.640]  social engineering component which prepares people for this and then when it happens it's
[03:11:58.640 --> 03:12:03.200]  it's not as shocking it's not as uh you know you're going to have as much opposition to it
[03:12:03.200 --> 03:12:08.320]  it's going to be a lot more natural so that's one component of this um some of the people in
[03:12:08.320 --> 03:12:14.320]  hollywood they're part of secrets you believe in these sort of dark esoteric types of things
[03:12:14.320 --> 03:12:18.480]  and so they actually believe that they're doing a ritual working and there are people who
[03:12:18.480 --> 03:12:23.520]  have worked in psychological warfare in the army in the military who have studied black magic and
[03:12:23.520 --> 03:12:29.280]  sorcery for the techniques that could be used for psyops and for social engineering uh for
[03:12:29.280 --> 03:12:34.160]  example michael akino the famous uh colonel who i think recently passed away uh he's he wrote a
[03:12:34.160 --> 03:12:40.240]  whole book on using black magic principles for army psyops he wrote a famous document called
[03:12:40.240 --> 03:12:45.520]  mind war to cy war that you can find which covers a lot of this as well in a more a compacted essay
[03:12:45.520 --> 03:12:50.880]  but these documents show that whatever you think of the dark side of spiritual forces or whatever
[03:12:50.880 --> 03:12:57.520]  even if you don't don't think it's real people study these because they are useful for manipulating
[03:12:57.520 --> 03:13:01.760]  people's worldviews so there are people that do believe these things and a lot of people believe
[03:13:01.760 --> 03:13:07.120]  in the demonic they believe in these kinds of um you know spiritual forces angelic and demonic and
[03:13:07.120 --> 03:13:13.520]  if you can manipulate and and and steer people's views on that it can be very useful for psychological
[03:13:13.520 --> 03:13:19.360]  warfare and for this kind of uh steering think about for example bladdy if you read about william
[03:13:19.360 --> 03:13:23.840]  peter bladdy he was actually involved in uh psychological operations in vietnam now i'm not
[03:13:23.840 --> 03:13:28.800]  saying he's a malicious person but uh if you read the essays about the formation of that script
[03:13:28.800 --> 03:13:34.400]  was actually consulted on by the cia because he was a psyops expert so he knew how to use fiction
[03:13:34.960 --> 03:13:40.640]  to really steer and and draw up drum up a lot of a lot of hype and fear in the population
[03:13:40.640 --> 03:13:45.280]  i'm not saying there's not demons i'm not saying that cia concocted the idea of exorcism or anything
[03:13:45.280 --> 03:13:50.880]  like that but that was useful at that time for the cia in terms of the cold war and if you go back
[03:13:50.880 --> 03:13:54.480]  and watch the exorcist in the film it's actually really evident uh that that's what's going on
[03:13:54.480 --> 03:13:59.600]  because they a lot of the anti-war protesters at that time in the film are actually castigated
[03:13:59.600 --> 03:14:04.800]  and they're sort of aligned with the demonic when it comes to this notion of these uh you know
[03:14:04.800 --> 03:14:08.800]  ufo invaders and all this kind of stuff that's actually another uh psychological warfare technique
[03:14:08.800 --> 03:14:14.720]  going back to the cold war two where even in old episodes of twilight zone which had actually had
[03:14:14.720 --> 03:14:20.960]  a dod consultation they would oftentimes tie in the notion of the external threat even if it's
[03:14:20.960 --> 03:14:26.080]  aliens to the external threat of a foreign enemy i'm not saying there's no foreign enemies or no
[03:14:26.080 --> 03:14:31.680]  foreign threats i'm just saying that this can be a tool for how to drum up fear confusion chaos
[03:14:31.680 --> 03:14:35.760]  seems like what's going on the last few weeks is just some kind of operation chaos i don't know
[03:14:35.760 --> 03:14:39.360]  what it is i just made that up but it's something like this to just really kind of give a bunch of
[03:14:39.360 --> 03:14:45.280]  distractions destabilization because when what's really going on uh biden uh north north stream
[03:14:45.280 --> 03:14:50.320]  which everybody knew about so i heard his article uh nato escalation uh world war three hunter biden
[03:14:50.320 --> 03:14:56.800]  laptop hunter biden ukraine uh the classified documents chemical spill inflation border security
[03:14:56.800 --> 03:15:02.960]  fentanyl sudden deaths by stabby's stabby side effects ftx i mean all of these things are real
[03:15:02.960 --> 03:15:08.640]  scandals but get everybody looking at these ridiculous balloons which you know maybe it is a
[03:15:08.640 --> 03:15:14.880]  surveillance i don't know um we don't know we can't trust what the stories that they give us uh you
[03:15:14.880 --> 03:15:18.320]  know that they're accurate we don't know but we do know that they consistently lie and it's the same
[03:15:18.320 --> 03:15:22.080]  people who told us that there were wmd's in iraq same people told us that you should take the
[03:15:22.080 --> 03:15:26.240]  stabby's say people said that you oh you can become a woman at will i can identify as an attack
[03:15:26.240 --> 03:15:31.120]  helicopter if i want to all of these things aren't from the same establishment telling us that we
[03:15:31.120 --> 03:15:37.680]  should be fearful for usos and aliens and who knows what else that's all psyops in my view when we
[03:15:37.680 --> 03:15:44.640]  come back we'll go through some more of these clips from the we have ghouls themselves outlining
[03:15:44.640 --> 03:15:49.360]  explaining all of the long-term plans for what they want to do to get rid of everybody and to
[03:15:49.360 --> 03:15:54.000]  create an austerity smart city hellhole this is the alex joneshow don't go anywhere i'm your

[03:20:17.920 --> 03:20:22.480]  welcome back to the outside so i'm your guest host j dire days analysis we were talking about white noise
[03:20:22.480 --> 03:20:27.920]  we're talking about all of the elements in this film in this presentation that do line up with
[03:20:27.920 --> 03:20:33.760]  real events which might say oh it's all coincidence really is it really cool i mean how many examples
[03:20:33.760 --> 03:20:39.200]  do we have in fiction where we have precise predictions of actual events and in many of these
[03:20:39.200 --> 03:20:44.560]  cases we find out that a lot of these films a lot of these television shows were actually consulted on
[03:20:44.560 --> 03:20:50.160]  by people from the intelligence agencies by people from the deep state dark all kinds of different
[03:20:50.160 --> 03:20:57.120]  attache connections going on here and i think that a better explanation is that when we look
[03:20:57.120 --> 03:21:01.920]  at the history of fiction especially british spy fiction gram green for example he would write about
[03:21:02.640 --> 03:21:07.600]  false flag operations that have really been conducted in his fiction think about the best
[03:21:07.600 --> 03:21:12.720]  example of all like what i wrote about in both of my books in phleming high-level naval intelligence
[03:21:12.720 --> 03:21:18.560]  what did he do what did he specialize in yeah he did scyops for the british navy but what did he
[03:21:18.560 --> 03:21:24.560]  really do fiction he wrote and created this archetypal character bond who was supposed to be the
[03:21:24.560 --> 03:21:31.440]  exemplification of western ideals western tradition at least post enlightenment right of the individual
[03:21:31.440 --> 03:21:37.120]  the uber mensch pleasure principle all these ideas that are embodied in james bond a lot of those
[03:21:37.120 --> 03:21:42.480]  operations in those stories in those novels and in those films are based on real operations they're
[03:21:42.480 --> 03:21:49.120]  based on real things going on and i've covered that at length i wrote my graduate work a lot of
[03:21:49.120 --> 03:21:54.320]  my graduate work on in phleming and this phenomenon so it's this always piqued my interest why would
[03:21:54.320 --> 03:21:59.280]  we have this phenomenon why would this exist and the best explanation again is that one a lot of
[03:21:59.280 --> 03:22:03.760]  people who worked in intelligence especially in the british empire were under official secrets acts
[03:22:03.760 --> 03:22:09.040]  so they couldn't put their work out they had to do it in a covert way in fiction but a lot of that
[03:22:09.040 --> 03:22:14.320]  fiction was based on reality and a lot of movies in hollywood right that are based on things like
[03:22:14.320 --> 03:22:19.200]  you know phleming phleming's writings have these principles of you know moon raker you've got this
[03:22:19.200 --> 03:22:24.800]  this eugenesis who wants to get rid of most of the people on planet earth and reseed the population
[03:22:24.800 --> 03:22:32.080]  with his own offspring amazing we actually have oligarchs who have a recent note who tried to do
[03:22:32.080 --> 03:22:37.840]  this exact same thing right we have epstein gates and what they were doing at mit these secret labs
[03:22:37.840 --> 03:22:42.800]  about trying to seed their offspring everywhere so all of this has come out because phleming new
[03:22:42.800 --> 03:22:46.720]  running in these circles of these billionaires and of these intelligence operatives and British
[03:22:46.720 --> 03:22:51.440]  intelligence that that's how people really operate you know when you see soros up there and he's got
[03:22:51.440 --> 03:22:56.640]  the eye bags that are basically look like resident evil villains that you have to you know they're
[03:22:56.640 --> 03:23:01.680]  going to sap your energy right like the the people that phleming writes about right clouds
[03:23:01.680 --> 03:23:06.400]  blow fell that these are not fictional presentations they're actually based on real world people
[03:23:06.400 --> 03:23:11.840]  and a lot of people don't know that blow fell was based on a composite of many villains but
[03:23:11.840 --> 03:23:15.520]  particularly alistair crowley right so the famous satanist of the 20th century who was also a
[03:23:15.520 --> 03:23:21.440]  british intelligent asset crowley was utilized by denise wheatley maxwell knight and some other
[03:23:22.080 --> 03:23:27.680]  british intelligence operatives to do some psyopsin whatnot against first in world war one against
[03:23:27.680 --> 03:23:32.640]  germany and then later to do some trickery with gerbils and whatnot that was all engineered
[03:23:32.640 --> 03:23:37.280]  by british intelligence to get him to fly into scotland uh and and crowley was involved in that
[03:23:38.160 --> 03:23:43.440]  so cult satanic groups hollywood media theater they've always had these overlaps this is nothing
[03:23:43.440 --> 03:23:48.240]  new it goes back to the ancient world it goes back especially to uh the elizabethan period the
[03:23:48.240 --> 03:23:53.600]  renaissance in the british empire is why shakespeare writes so often about all these esoteric and
[03:23:53.600 --> 03:24:02.000]  occult elements in his plays is because this is part of that craft okay think about state craft
[03:24:02.000 --> 03:24:07.680]  spy craft the craft of masonry which also has overlapped with a lot of these things if you
[03:24:07.680 --> 03:24:13.280]  watch something like uh the man who would be king with my okay Sean Connery if you watch
[03:24:13.280 --> 03:24:20.000]  the man who would be king that's a masonic movie about the british empire's free masonic spy network
[03:24:20.000 --> 03:24:24.240]  and that's really what free masonry was during that time period was the the british empire spy
[03:24:24.240 --> 03:24:29.360]  network so we have to understand these things if we want to understand how the the theater that's
[03:24:29.360 --> 03:24:34.640]  projected to the to the world right we're we all uh you know the world's a theater right this kind
[03:24:34.640 --> 03:24:42.640]  of thing um to control the theater to control the mass media theater is crucial to controlling
[03:24:42.640 --> 03:24:48.240]  psychological warfare controlling the narratives and that's what a lot of these secret societies
[03:24:48.240 --> 03:24:52.560]  and deep state networks do think about operation mockingbird operation mockingbird was actually
[03:24:52.560 --> 03:24:57.680]  funded a lot of the money that went into that from the cia had actually when it came from gladio
[03:24:57.680 --> 03:25:01.760]  operations and this is covered in the paul williams book it's what i'm going to be lecturing on next
[03:25:01.760 --> 03:25:07.360]  and this gets into clerical subversion how clerics are compromised particularly in the roman cali
[03:25:07.360 --> 03:25:11.280]  church in this case but it's not just the roman cali church this extends to all of the churches
[03:25:11.280 --> 03:25:16.720]  and denominations they go in they buy up they uh fund the seminaries they buy them off they
[03:25:16.720 --> 03:25:21.280]  compromise them and we see this now with a lot of the clerics whether it's uh francis or whether
[03:25:21.280 --> 03:25:25.920]  it's bartholomew the ecumenical patriarchy that he's just at the world economic forum right
[03:25:25.920 --> 03:25:31.520]  bartholomew is there like chilling with all of the other global elites and so let's go to this first
[03:25:31.520 --> 03:25:36.560]  clip uh from the wef because this is going to make my point as to how this collusion and this
[03:25:36.560 --> 03:25:44.160]  networking works this is uh the i think it's a 2015 video yeah of somebody at the wef talking
[03:25:44.160 --> 03:25:53.760]  about the power of mrna gene therapy experiments okay let's look at that so this is a precision tool
[03:25:53.760 --> 03:26:02.160]  that now allows us to take this protein RNA complex and introduce it into cells or tissues
[03:26:02.160 --> 03:26:08.800]  to correct mutations at sites where we know there's a deleterious change in the genetic code
[03:26:09.520 --> 03:26:15.440]  so i wanted to show you an example of how this can be utilized this um protein complex can actually
[03:26:15.440 --> 03:26:21.600]  be injected directly into fertilized eggs of a mouse and in the experiment you'll see
[03:26:21.600 --> 03:26:28.320]  we're targeting a gene that is responsible for the black coat color in mice and so normally these
[03:26:28.320 --> 03:26:36.160]  mice have beautiful glossy black coats and once we make this targeted change we then implant these
[03:26:36.160 --> 03:26:43.360]  edited eggs back into a female mouse and when she gives birth to pups you'll see that the pups are
[03:26:43.360 --> 03:26:49.120]  now mostly white and the remarkable thing about this experiment is that that when these mouse mice
[03:26:49.120 --> 03:26:55.360]  grow up you can test them and show that every cell in the body has this single genetic change that
[03:26:55.360 --> 03:27:00.240]  gives rise to the white coat color but otherwise they're absolutely normal so they're normal mice
[03:27:00.240 --> 03:27:06.560]  no mutations elsewhere in the genome this is a type of experiment that used to take at least a year
[03:27:06.560 --> 03:27:12.400]  to create a mouse like this and now it can be done in a few weeks um and by people that don't have
[03:27:12.400 --> 03:27:18.720]  to have special expertise so this is a technology has over it's been very exciting over the last
[03:27:18.720 --> 03:27:23.760]  two and a half years to see this technology taking off these are publications in the scientific
[03:27:23.760 --> 03:27:29.520]  literature it's been sort of exponential growth of publications people using this technology for
[03:27:29.520 --> 03:27:36.320]  all sorts of applications and so some of these include making changes and targeted genetic changes
[03:27:36.320 --> 03:27:43.920]  in plants in fungi in animals that are important to agriculturally in animals that are important to
[03:27:43.920 --> 03:27:50.800]  us as pets and also for in thinking about human health also to do things like make changes in
[03:27:50.800 --> 03:27:57.200]  stem cells which are cells that can give rise to new organs also to make changes in animals that
[03:27:57.200 --> 03:28:03.200]  are important as models of human disease such as mice and monkeys and we think within the
[03:28:03.200 --> 03:28:08.000]  not too distant future it will be possible to actually use this technology to make changes in
[03:28:08.000 --> 03:28:14.640]  human so there you go so the mrna gene therapy experimental stabbies we looked at what it did
[03:28:14.640 --> 03:28:20.320]  to change not just the recipient but also the recipients offspring they're telling you right
[03:28:20.320 --> 03:28:27.360]  there in 2015 that this would be used for humans she says in the near future here we are they've
[03:28:27.360 --> 03:28:33.200]  rolled that out now that is that that's exactly what claus said as well don't forget claus saying
[03:28:33.200 --> 03:28:40.480]  that the new world all that's not really about changing your mind the reader change will be you

[03:33:44.880 --> 03:33:50.240]  if you want to hear more of those hanging hits we were talking about psyops we're talking about
[03:33:50.240 --> 03:33:54.400]  deception we're talking about mind control we're talking about world economic forum greatest hits
[03:33:54.400 --> 03:34:00.320]  what are the greatest hits of the world economic forum and they're outright just laying it all out
[03:34:00.320 --> 03:34:05.360]  there for us very helpful very helpful to wake everybody up because i think a lot of these
[03:34:05.360 --> 03:34:10.480]  clips that kind of go viral on twitter you know get millions of views of these wf people just saying
[03:34:10.480 --> 03:34:15.840]  what they're going to do and we can't in the greatest hits lineup we can't forget the classic
[03:34:15.840 --> 03:34:21.600]  from 2016 which was the eight predictions and a lot of people i talked to a lot of people this
[03:34:21.600 --> 03:34:25.200]  week we did a lot of media stuff a lot of media spots a lot of interviews a lot of people forgotten
[03:34:25.200 --> 03:34:30.080]  this video but it's a classic we have to remember this one let's roll this entire one all eight
[03:34:30.080 --> 03:34:46.000]  predictions because this this also lays it all out this is key they took this one down by the way
[03:35:00.080 --> 03:35:16.000]  so
[03:35:16.320 --> 03:35:22.000]  for those that are not watching you're listening it's basically just laying out eight things that
[03:35:22.000 --> 03:35:26.640]  will be predicted by the by the year 2030 it's a 2016 wf video that they put out
[03:35:26.640 --> 03:35:34.240]  um and some of these are really key for basically changing the entire structure of the west
[03:35:34.240 --> 03:35:38.240]  basically a model a plan for destruction of western civilizations all this is what
[03:35:38.240 --> 03:35:43.680]  it amounts to right um but everybody forgets the alien one here uh oh we're going to go to mars and
[03:35:43.680 --> 03:35:53.040]  then uh oh oh we're going to find alien life exactly so here we are western values have to
[03:35:53.040 --> 03:36:00.560]  be tested and brought to a breaking point check some balances that underpin democracy must not
[03:36:00.560 --> 03:36:07.760]  be forgotten yeah right as if any of this is a bunch of unelected bureaucrats zillionaires
[03:36:07.760 --> 03:36:12.800]  who have no interest in democracy whatsoever although actually to be clear they do utilize
[03:36:12.800 --> 03:36:18.640]  democracy as a tool of subversion we're a republic not actually democracy democracy
[03:36:18.640 --> 03:36:23.440]  worst form of government ever um and that's what they push and pretend to be
[03:36:24.160 --> 03:36:29.440]  democrats or not well democrats are basically run by oligarchs best example of this right
[03:36:30.000 --> 03:36:35.760]  but it's not democracy which is a joke uh and so every one of these predictions in this
[03:36:35.760 --> 03:36:42.400]  2016 you can begin to see how this plan this model particularly fits into the last three years what
[03:36:42.400 --> 03:36:47.760]  are the Rockefeller lockstep documents say well it said in the first scenario that this worldwide
[03:36:47.760 --> 03:36:55.600]  pandemic that would happen 2010 lockstep that it would lead the way to the automation of everything
[03:36:55.600 --> 03:37:01.120]  in society greater steps towards automation i should say and so what does this video know
[03:37:01.120 --> 03:37:05.920]  well the video says yeah you will have the the the bugs delivered to your door you won't be
[03:37:05.920 --> 03:37:11.200]  eating meat by the way which is now in the last couple years the major push of these people you
[03:37:11.200 --> 03:37:16.080]  have to be under a carbon rationing system cutting down your carbon cutting down your meat consumption
[03:37:16.080 --> 03:37:23.840]  literally it's all in this 2016 wef video oh and also alien life that's rolling out now all this
[03:37:23.840 --> 03:37:29.200]  big sigh up of the alien nonsense and it's particularly the western values have to be tested
[03:37:29.200 --> 03:37:33.680]  and that's because all the global elite going back a hundred years have made it a point to go to war
[03:37:33.680 --> 03:37:40.720]  against the fundamental values of the west that at least have the skeletal remains of christianity
[03:37:40.720 --> 03:37:46.560]  common law moral law mosaic law all those those skeletal remains now i also have to be gotten
[03:37:46.560 --> 03:37:51.520]  rid of but there's something really important that happens really crazy that happens when you get
[03:37:51.520 --> 03:37:56.240]  rid of the things like biblical law or basic principles like the ten commandments if man is
[03:37:56.240 --> 03:38:03.280]  no longer made in the image of god then there's not any basis for the dignity that he has there's
[03:38:03.280 --> 03:38:07.520]  no god right we're just basically manifestations of the natural world if we're just manifestations
[03:38:07.520 --> 03:38:12.240]  of the natural world then we could be dispensed with like any other piece of the natural world
[03:38:12.240 --> 03:38:17.360]  we're just cattle we're just vegetation so we could be experimented on dispensed with
[03:38:17.360 --> 03:38:20.720]  and that's precisely the attitude of these people these are the people behind
[03:38:22.000 --> 03:38:29.680]  the reset behind the build back better and so you're going to notice that there's a commonality
[03:38:29.680 --> 03:38:35.440]  here what have i been lecturing on last uh five years through 50 60 different texts from the right
[03:38:35.440 --> 03:38:41.840]  the writings of the elite this very plan there's only one plan it is the anglo-atlanticus american
[03:38:41.840 --> 03:38:47.920]  establishment that is behind this plan they have a plan to create this global technocratic order
[03:38:49.120 --> 03:38:55.920]  and they basically decided to come out through these big global summits that are public world
[03:38:55.920 --> 03:39:02.880]  government sub summit and lay it all out and one of the richest men in the world can call in
[03:39:02.880 --> 03:39:07.920]  in pipe in to the summit say that he doesn't like the idea of world government and there's
[03:39:07.920 --> 03:39:12.080]  still all people across the normie sphere mainstream eat out there's no such thing as world
[03:39:12.080 --> 03:39:17.760]  government as they have a giant world government summit as the richest ish dude in the world
[03:39:18.400 --> 03:39:24.000]  calls in to say it's not a good idea so what do you mean it doesn't exist what do you i mean
[03:39:24.640 --> 03:39:27.920]  that's that over some window that they do where they you know gaslight inside everybody said
[03:39:27.920 --> 03:39:34.080]  oh uh you're a crazy coup because you say that it exists and then it's like well they're rolling
[03:39:34.080 --> 03:39:38.640]  it out but it's world governance not world government you see that's very that's what they
[03:39:38.640 --> 03:39:45.360]  tried a few years ago like playing word games then it was world government's rolling out and
[03:39:45.360 --> 03:39:50.480]  here's why that's a good thing right to use the twitter speak of the blue check journalists on
[03:39:50.480 --> 03:39:56.320]  twitter right and then it becomes now it's time to punish those who went against our world government
[03:39:56.320 --> 03:40:00.480]  right so there was no world government and it moves all the way to it's time to punish those that
[03:40:00.480 --> 03:40:06.240]  oppose the world government but you can see from that eight point prediction laid out which by the
[03:40:06.240 --> 03:40:10.320]  way isn't all of the text you know if you read claus's book forth it was a revolution it says
[03:40:10.320 --> 03:40:15.040]  all the same stuff in there it's in claus's book and it's in this it's the same plan a hundred years
[03:40:15.040 --> 03:40:22.000]  ago that a she well's writes about in his books so identical plan same power structure os s c i a
[03:40:22.000 --> 03:40:28.880]  that's who set up davos kissinger went and found a claus to to be in that role kissinger working
[03:40:28.880 --> 03:40:33.680]  for rock a feller foundation for many years had alex just had dr. francis boil on and dr.
[03:40:33.680 --> 03:40:36.480]  francis bull said everything that i've been saying and you've heard me say for a long time
[03:40:37.040 --> 03:40:43.280]  yeah of course it's the kissinger chair that i was given and kissingers who found claus and they
[03:40:43.280 --> 03:40:49.600]  put him up to be for a time steering bill berg and now to steer this other more public thing
[03:40:49.600 --> 03:40:52.960]  where you have a bunch of celebrities and a bunch of more public people kevin spacey and
[03:40:52.960 --> 03:40:57.440]  lean under the caprio they go to davos and we're like i'm in for him and it's all public
[03:40:58.080 --> 03:41:01.600]  although it's funny that this year was kind of a pr disaster a lot of people didn't want to go
[03:41:02.160 --> 03:41:07.920]  you know i think just in my opinion because of so much attention like alex this broadcast so many
[03:41:07.920 --> 03:41:13.120]  people in our sphere pushing out this information especially on twitter twitter has been so crucial
[03:41:13.120 --> 03:41:18.880]  that's why they're so mad about it think what you will be on must if the videos are going viral
[03:41:18.880 --> 03:41:23.520]  with millions of views of claus and the ghouls talking about what they want to do
[03:41:25.440 --> 03:41:30.800]  thank god that's going to wake people up and that's what we need it's all this other stuff a lot of
[03:41:30.800 --> 03:41:35.280]  this other stuff's distractions right so let's go to the next clip if we have time uh maybe we
[03:41:35.280 --> 03:41:38.720]  should wait i don't know uh i can't remember how long that clip but here's trudeau just play a
[03:41:38.720 --> 03:41:45.120]  little bit of trudeau clip talking about the purpose of great reset fitting into the coof the coof
[03:41:45.120 --> 03:41:51.440]  narrative building back better means getting support to the most vulnerable while maintaining
[03:41:51.440 --> 03:41:58.160]  our momentum on reaching the 2030 agenda for sustainable development and the sdgs canada is
[03:41:58.160 --> 03:42:04.960]  here to listen and to help this pandemic has provided an opportunity for a reset this is our
[03:42:04.960 --> 03:42:10.960]  chance to accelerate our pre-pandemic efforts to reimagine economic systems that actually address
[03:42:10.960 --> 03:42:18.080]  global challenges like extreme poverty inequality and climate change yeah they're going to address
[03:42:18.080 --> 03:42:22.320]  poverty and climate change by making everybody poor and then everybody dead and then there won't be
[03:42:22.320 --> 03:42:26.000]  any poverty and there won't be any climate change there won't be any suffering because they get rid
[03:42:26.000 --> 03:42:30.240]  of the beings that suffer so we won't have these problems if we get rid of the beings right i mean
[03:42:30.240 --> 03:42:34.640]  literally that's what he's saying in co by the way he also said what that if you if you disagreed
[03:42:34.640 --> 03:42:40.240]  with uh he said that if you don't believe in science you're racist makes no sense at all
[03:42:40.240 --> 03:42:44.560]  but it doesn't have to make sense because it's low-level propaganda and psyops we're going to

[03:48:11.760 --> 03:48:16.640]  is cringe core satire that's it that's all that's left all right so we were talking about uh the
[03:48:17.680 --> 03:48:24.240]  whirling on reforms greatest hits all their top 10 top eight nine top nine best clips
[03:48:25.040 --> 03:48:33.680]  and we did uh uh castro i mean truto there in canada doing his explanation openly about how
[03:48:33.680 --> 03:48:39.760]  the right reset will be particularly useful now that we're able to build build back better right so
[03:48:39.760 --> 03:48:44.720]  that the agenda can move forward which is what all the white papers said build back better
[03:48:45.280 --> 03:48:50.000]  as a result of covet and the lockdowns now we can build back better now we can bring about
[03:48:50.000 --> 03:48:55.920]  the right reset which is this austerity model i remember listening to alex back in the 2010 1112
[03:48:55.920 --> 03:49:04.000]  time when there was a lot of coverage of the imf and world bank uh basically looting europe and
[03:49:04.000 --> 03:49:10.480]  we had the economic crashes we have that uh economic uh the imf four step plan which is actually a
[03:49:10.480 --> 03:49:16.560]  50 step plan where they have a model to uh from the greg palast article how to deconstruct and
[03:49:16.560 --> 03:49:20.960]  destroy these countries and then remodel them into where they want to go and we have to understand
[03:49:20.960 --> 03:49:26.880]  that those are just kind of little puzzle pieces in a bigger puzzle piece and actually a full puzzle
[03:49:26.880 --> 03:49:32.800]  basically outlined by whirling on forum davos and this overall plan for where they want to take
[03:49:32.800 --> 03:49:38.720]  things in the next phase think of it as business phases like rolling out a business plan the big
[03:49:38.720 --> 03:49:46.000]  catalyzing events are crucial for moving us to the next phase of the business plan the koof and this
[03:49:46.000 --> 03:49:52.160]  pentagon psi out which was rolled out as a giant exercise a giant operation almost globally
[03:49:52.160 --> 03:49:59.200]  pretty much globally it was all part of this uh longer strategy for bringing in what all of
[03:49:59.200 --> 03:50:04.800]  these same people write about which is this ultimate technocratic order and the the lockstep
[03:50:04.800 --> 03:50:10.240]  document is so key because it actually outlines that it is for automation and technocracy within
[03:50:10.240 --> 03:50:16.640]  the first scenario so let's go to the next clip which is that tech will result in man's liberation
[03:50:16.640 --> 03:50:19.520]  or the worst enslavement of the world has ever seen this is clip number six
[03:50:21.360 --> 03:50:27.440]  what paying through technology and ability for consumers to measure their own carbon footprint
[03:50:28.640 --> 03:50:33.760]  what does that mean that's where are they traveling how are they traveling what are
[03:50:33.760 --> 03:50:40.400]  they eating what are they consuming on the platform so individual carbon footprint tracker
[03:50:41.280 --> 03:50:45.200]  stay tuned we don't have it operational yet but this is something that we're working on
[03:50:46.400 --> 03:50:51.840]  this is what's up next what were the lockdowns telling us oh mother earth is healing mami earth
[03:50:51.840 --> 03:50:58.080]  is healing she's healing the climate log nails are great because apparently earth is a living being
[03:50:58.080 --> 03:51:02.720]  that they can heal itself but i thought it was just dead inanimate matter matter in motion no
[03:51:02.720 --> 03:51:08.080]  it's actually a living being that can heal itself and if you don't go along with this you are a
[03:51:08.080 --> 03:51:12.560]  cancerous cell in mother earth yeah there you go there's your coom pod now this is mark suckerberg
[03:51:12.560 --> 03:51:18.240]  i'm so happy to tell you that the coom pods are rolling out now you're not going to be able to get
[03:51:18.240 --> 03:51:22.480]  out you're going to be sucking your coom pod for the for the rest of your life until we decide to
[03:51:22.480 --> 03:51:31.360]  turn off your vitamins anyway uh that that clip right there told you that what they want to roll out
[03:51:31.360 --> 03:51:37.840]  out is carbon allotments right and that you they're going to be tracking what you eat what you do
[03:51:37.840 --> 03:51:42.000]  where you go on what platform the bis that was the other clip i forgot the guy with like five
[03:51:42.000 --> 03:51:49.360]  chins the bis was saying that it's time to roll out the cbdcs and the cbdcs when they roll out
[03:51:49.360 --> 03:51:53.440]  which is we'll be connected with that guy was just talking about like tracking everything
[03:51:53.440 --> 03:51:57.120]  you do the planned opposite clips remember that from ten years yeah there he is that guy he says
[03:51:57.120 --> 03:52:05.680]  uh when we get the cbdcs out your wallets will be shut off when you go against esg type violations
[03:52:07.120 --> 03:52:12.320]  so it's all here everything tracked and traced i don't know if it's the end of the world but it's a
[03:52:12.320 --> 03:52:18.320]  b system perfectly outlined in these clips let's go to the next clip which is uh no you have a
[03:52:18.320 --> 03:52:26.240]  horari uh number seven the technology will on the one hand make it possible to start enhancing
[03:52:26.240 --> 03:52:31.040]  and upgrading humans and on the other hand especially the rise of ai will make more and more
[03:52:31.040 --> 03:52:37.040]  humans economically unnecessary there's just a brief clip it comes back
[03:52:40.480 --> 03:52:45.040]  yes so this is horari talking about what to expect through the ai which is what they're rolling out
[03:52:45.040 --> 03:52:49.840]  right now i think there's a little more to this clip but it bleeps out for some some
[03:52:49.840 --> 03:52:58.160]  a few seconds yeah well so there you have horari telling us that uh the ai is going to be rolled
[03:52:58.160 --> 03:53:04.000]  out now to replace humanity and in other clips he talks about how they're going to create these
[03:53:04.000 --> 03:53:09.200]  sort of clone farms and people will just be born in test tubes that was written about a long time
[03:53:09.200 --> 03:53:13.760]  this is not a conspiracy this is written about a long time ago by lord burkinhead and his cosmopolitan
[03:53:13.760 --> 03:53:18.000]  essay they wrote in 1920s part of the royal society with birch and russell that's that was
[03:53:18.000 --> 03:53:22.240]  then put into brave new world which is a significant part of the novel is that people aren't born
[03:53:22.240 --> 03:53:26.240]  naturally they're all born in test tubes and they're already doing this with the crisper
[03:53:26.240 --> 03:53:30.320]  technology and you know tweaking genetic uh designer babies all this kind of stuff that's
[03:53:30.320 --> 03:53:36.080]  preparing us for what they want to roll out next which is the uh joining of humanity with the tech
[03:53:36.080 --> 03:53:41.040]  a new kind of android life form that's what all the trans movement was about it's not about your
[03:53:41.040 --> 03:53:45.440]  rights not about your sexuality or this stuff that's it's actually about the preparation for this
[03:53:45.440 --> 03:53:51.360]  this i mean it's a sterilization thing too sure it's dark and satanic but the ultimate goal is
[03:53:51.360 --> 03:53:55.920]  the rolling out of the transhumanist agenda which they're all talking about i mean again
[03:53:55.920 --> 03:53:59.600]  harari's one of the most famous transhumanists in the world and he's there at the world i can
[03:53:59.600 --> 03:54:04.240]  perform with claus and all these people telling you with the support of gilbates what they're
[03:54:04.240 --> 03:54:18.000]  gonna do okay next clip is claus is the master of the world number eight now where we move into the
[03:54:18.000 --> 03:54:28.160]  exponential phase and i agree artificial intelligence but not only artificial intelligence but also
[03:54:28.160 --> 03:54:36.480]  also the metaverse near space technologies and i could go on and on synthetic biology
