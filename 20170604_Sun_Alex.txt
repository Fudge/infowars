[00:00.000 --> 00:14.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Sunday, June 4th, 2017, I'm your host, Alan Jones.
[00:14.040 --> 00:21.320]  We saw more historic terror attacks on London Bridge last night and with the poor Brits
[00:21.320 --> 00:26.960]  being chased into local bars and being hacked up with large knives until police killed them.
[00:26.960 --> 00:33.480]  In the classic case of the disarmed slaves, here is the Prime Minister responding to this.
[00:33.480 --> 00:38.880]  Shortly before 10 past 10 yesterday evening, the Metropolitan Police received reports that
[00:38.880 --> 00:44.040]  a white van had struck pedestrians on London Bridge.
[00:44.040 --> 00:49.680]  It continued to drive from London Bridge to Borough Market, where three terrorists left
[00:49.680 --> 00:56.320]  the van and attacked innocent and unarmed civilians with blades and knives.
[00:56.320 --> 01:01.720]  All three were wearing what appeared to be explosive vests, but the police have established
[01:01.720 --> 01:08.280]  that this clothing was fake and worn only to spread panic and fear.
[01:08.280 --> 01:16.120]  As so often in such serious situations, the police responded with great courage and great speed.
[01:16.120 --> 01:21.120]  Armed officers from the Metropolitan Police and the City of London Police arrived at
[01:21.120 --> 01:27.040]  Borough Market within moments and shot and killed the three suspects.
[01:27.040 --> 01:32.400]  The terrorists were confronted and shot by armed officers within eight minutes of the
[01:32.400 --> 01:36.920]  police receiving the first emergency call.
[01:36.920 --> 01:41.720]  Seven people have died as a result of the attack, in addition to the three suspects
[01:41.720 --> 01:44.120]  shot dead by the police.
[01:44.120 --> 01:49.040]  Forty-eight people are being treated in several hospitals across London.
[01:49.040 --> 01:53.560]  Many have life-threatening conditions.
[01:53.560 --> 01:59.720]  This is, as we all know, the third terrorist attack Britain has experienced in the last
[01:59.720 --> 02:01.720]  three months.
[02:01.720 --> 02:07.040]  In March, a similar attack took place just around the corner on Westminster Bridge.
[02:07.040 --> 02:13.200]  Two weeks ago, the Manchester Arena was attacked by a suicide bomber, and now London has been
[02:13.200 --> 02:16.160]  struck once more.
[02:16.160 --> 02:23.160]  And at the same time, the security and intelligence agencies and police have disrupted five credible
[02:23.160 --> 02:25.960]  plots since the Westminster attack in March.
[02:25.960 --> 02:27.960]  That's why they had to put trips on the streets.
[02:27.960 --> 02:34.280]  In terms of their planning and execution, the recent attacks are not connected.
[02:34.280 --> 02:40.640]  But we believe we are experiencing a new trend in the threat we face as terrorism breeds
[02:40.640 --> 02:41.640]  terrorism.
[02:41.640 --> 02:42.640]  ISIS has announced that.
[02:42.640 --> 02:47.800]  The protesters are inspired to attack, not only on the basis of carefully constructed
[02:47.800 --> 02:53.800]  plots after years of planning and training, and not even as lone attackers radicalised
[02:53.800 --> 03:01.680]  online, but by copying one another and often using the crudest of means of attack.
[03:01.680 --> 03:07.640]  We cannot and must not pretend that things can continue as they are.
[03:07.640 --> 03:12.640]  While the recent attacks are not connected by common networks, they are connected in
[03:12.640 --> 03:15.320]  one important sense.
[03:15.320 --> 03:22.320]  They are bound together by the single evil ideology of Islamistic extremism that preaches
[03:22.320 --> 03:26.640]  hatred, sows division, and promotes sectarianism.
[03:26.640 --> 03:27.640]  That's right.
[03:27.640 --> 03:28.640]  Call it what it is.
[03:28.640 --> 03:29.640]  Islamic.
[03:29.640 --> 03:34.600]  It is an ideology that claims our Western values of freedom, democracy and human rights
[03:34.600 --> 03:38.400]  are incompatible with the religion of Islam.
[03:38.400 --> 03:46.000]  It is an ideology that is a perversion of Islam and a perversion of the truth.
[03:46.000 --> 03:51.640]  Defeating this ideology is one of the great challenges of our time, but it cannot be defeated
[03:51.640 --> 03:55.000]  through military intervention alone.
[03:55.000 --> 03:59.960]  It will not be defeated through the maintenance of a permanent defensive counter-terrorism
[03:59.960 --> 04:00.960]  operation.
[04:00.960 --> 04:10.560]  It will only be defeated when we turn people's minds away from this violence and make them
[04:10.560 --> 04:17.480]  understand that our values, pluralistic British values, are superior to anything they want
[04:17.480 --> 04:18.480]  to take you over.
[04:18.480 --> 04:19.480]  They want to take you over.
[04:19.480 --> 04:20.480]  They want to take you over.
[04:20.480 --> 04:21.480]  It's cancer.
[04:21.480 --> 04:22.480]  That's enough.
[04:22.480 --> 04:23.480]  There is to be frank.
[04:23.480 --> 04:24.480]  We're going to go to break.
[04:24.480 --> 04:26.520]  I'm going to come back and walk through all this.
[04:26.520 --> 04:28.560]  Most folks understand what's happening here.
[04:28.560 --> 04:33.600]  Some of my listeners, and I see that on InfoWars.com, are saying, Alex, you know, you're the guy
[04:33.600 --> 04:39.520]  that popularized the term false flag or inside job, this is all staged.
[04:39.520 --> 04:44.400]  The staging is Soros and the Globalist bringing in 5 million military aged men the last six
[04:44.400 --> 04:46.240]  years into Europe.
[04:46.240 --> 04:50.880]  The staging is knowing they're getting trained in all this and our government's backing
[04:50.880 --> 04:55.800]  the Arab Spring under Obama and others, and Hillary.
[04:55.800 --> 04:57.400]  So yes, it is staged.
[04:57.400 --> 05:02.120]  The terror attacks are real, but the Globalists are what are protecting it.
[05:02.120 --> 05:07.120]  Well folks, it seems like life on the D list, our decapitation list, isn't what it's all
[05:07.120 --> 05:08.440]  cracked up to be.
[05:08.440 --> 05:13.760]  You've seen the now infamous images of comedian Kathy Griffin holding up the mock head of
[05:13.760 --> 05:18.120]  Donald Trump, and you've seen the endless news stories of her apologizing, her being
[05:18.120 --> 05:22.640]  called out by the left and right, and losing some of her lucrative paying gigs.
[05:22.640 --> 05:23.640]  That's right.
[05:23.640 --> 05:27.400]  The press conference is going to hold a press conference to complain about bullying from
[05:27.400 --> 05:28.400]  the Trump family.
[05:28.400 --> 05:32.520]  She should be lucky people are even talking about her, and now we see the true response
[05:32.520 --> 05:33.520]  of the liberals.
[05:33.520 --> 05:36.040]  I'm a victim.
[05:36.040 --> 05:40.080]  During this press conference, they're also going to announce her true motivation behind
[05:40.080 --> 05:41.080]  the photo shoot.
[05:41.080 --> 05:43.960]  Well, it doesn't really matter what your motivation was, Kathy.
[05:43.960 --> 05:45.200]  That's a mute point at this time.
[05:45.200 --> 05:49.840]  Please, for the sake of America, shut your piehole, crawl back into your she-lob lair,
[05:49.840 --> 05:52.800]  and just be happy that tweets are the only thing coming your way.
[05:52.800 --> 05:56.400]  Rob Dew reporting for infowars.com and infowars nightly news.
[05:56.400 --> 06:25.680]  Let's ask yourself, what are you doing to wake up minds?
[06:25.680 --> 06:54.960]  What are you doing to wake up minds?
[06:54.960 --> 06:59.160]  You don't want to ship in five million military aged men.
[06:59.160 --> 07:02.720]  There's been about six and a half million refugees the last five years in the Europe
[07:02.720 --> 07:03.720]  and the UK.
[07:03.720 --> 07:05.200]  That's official inter-poll numbers.
[07:05.200 --> 07:08.080]  80% are estimated to be military aged men.
[07:08.080 --> 07:13.480]  They've got other polls out where 98% of the so-called teenagers are also men, so they're
[07:13.480 --> 07:16.400]  not children or teenagers coming in.
[07:16.400 --> 07:22.280]  Now do you ban everybody's free speech and have a big internet police force internationally
[07:22.280 --> 07:27.320]  to stop Islamic terror, or do you stop bringing people in from the failed state of Libya, the
[07:27.320 --> 07:33.720]  failed state of Syria, the failed state of Iraq, obviously you stop bringing in the people
[07:33.720 --> 07:34.720]  that are doing the attacks?
[07:34.720 --> 07:36.840]  But let's go further.
[07:36.840 --> 07:43.320]  The EU, the United Nations, the different Soros funds that are openly funding the Arab
[07:43.320 --> 07:50.440]  Spring, that are openly funding and promoting all this jihadist garbage, they need to get
[07:50.440 --> 07:55.720]  in trouble for what they've done, and they need to stop financing the most radical forms
[07:55.720 --> 07:58.400]  of Islam to go around conquering the Middle East.
[07:58.400 --> 08:04.600]  It is a fact that there are a lot of America haters in this world, and it is a fact there
[08:04.600 --> 08:08.440]  are a lot of globalists that are trying to destroy the freedoms we have in the West,
[08:08.440 --> 08:15.200]  in the middle class, and that they are allied with the most nasty, despicable, disgusting,
[08:15.200 --> 08:22.120]  murderous forms of Orthodox Wahhabi Islam.
[08:22.120 --> 08:28.520]  Now you think about Europe, five million military age men, many of them off the battlefields
[08:28.520 --> 08:32.640]  of the Middle East, who kill each other in their own towns and cities, one upping each
[08:32.640 --> 08:39.560]  other on who's the most Islamic, you bring in these radicalized people that are constantly
[08:39.560 --> 08:44.400]  competing with each other for who can be more backward, then you have the left that's so
[08:44.400 --> 08:49.640]  busy apologizing for them, who's been endorsing them so long, they will never say that they
[08:49.640 --> 08:54.760]  were in the wrong, so they'll never back off defending it, and I've got stacks of news
[08:54.760 --> 09:02.400]  articles here today, they're also up on infowars.com, where you've got major newspapers and major
[09:02.400 --> 09:08.480]  publications saying, let's not be mean to Muslims, let's back off, let's not say this
[09:08.480 --> 09:12.920]  is an Islamic attack, remember Obama would never call terror Islamic terror, or radical
[09:12.920 --> 09:15.880]  Islamic terror.
[09:15.880 --> 09:21.120]  And you see Kathy Griffin last week holding up the, you know, the aka ISIS severed head
[09:21.120 --> 09:28.800]  of Trump, and you've got Katy Perry pushing open borders, and you've got Ariana Grande
[09:28.800 --> 09:34.520]  pushing it, and then the Islamists go and attack the very people that have been supporting
[09:34.520 --> 09:39.600]  bringing them in, that's because in the whacked out Islamic ideology, it's not controlled
[09:39.600 --> 09:43.440]  by the globalist, it's just let in.
[09:43.440 --> 09:54.360]  The doors just opened, it hates liberals, gays, lesbians, rock and roll, pop music,
[09:54.360 --> 09:59.360]  women going around in many skirts, they went and targeted a bunch of teenagers, you know,
[09:59.360 --> 10:09.720]  dressed up, in many cases, provocatively, because that's what drives radical orthodox
[10:09.720 --> 10:15.040]  Islam up a wall, they kill women that go out dressed like that in public, they rape women
[10:15.040 --> 10:23.360]  and if the woman complains she's charged with adultery, she's charged with the sex crime.
[10:23.360 --> 10:31.520]  It's a fact, almost every Muslim nation is 99% Muslim or 100%, unless you count guest
[10:31.520 --> 10:37.280]  workers, a lot of Hindus they bring in for guest work, everybody brings in the indents
[10:37.280 --> 10:42.680]  for workers or hard workers, smart folks, 99% Muslim, why is that?
[10:42.680 --> 10:49.240]  Because they're not tolerant, and Saudi Arabia and Qatar and all the rest of them know what
[10:49.240 --> 10:57.560]  to do, they export their 68% under the age of 30, their giant young male population,
[10:57.560 --> 11:01.000]  they say you want living space, go to Syria, go to Egypt, go take over the other Muslim
[11:01.000 --> 11:06.640]  countries or go into Turkey and go into Europe, don't come here, Saudi Arabia has taken year
[11:06.640 --> 11:10.640]  to date during the refugee crisis that the UN helped engineer by destroying the Middle
[11:10.640 --> 11:14.560]  East, by bringing in the Arab Spring, and the Peter Sutherland and the UN program and
[11:14.560 --> 11:20.280]  all of them, George Soros, all openly announced come to Europe, it's all free, come here,
[11:20.280 --> 11:26.640]  they create the crisis, they create the environment, they open the borders and then they bring
[11:26.640 --> 11:33.960]  in 5 million men, military aged men, other million or so women and children, you watch
[11:33.960 --> 11:39.080]  the videos of thousands coming in, none of them are old men, none of them are old women,
[11:39.080 --> 11:44.160]  because they're being sent on the jihad, there's what five pillars of jihad and you've also
[11:44.160 --> 11:49.240]  got to go to Mecca at least once in life for the Hajj, but bigger than the Hajj is when
[11:49.240 --> 11:54.880]  the jihad comes, the physical jihad, you go forth and ISIS said four years ago, you can
[11:54.880 --> 12:03.600]  Google this, ISIS announces plans to use refugees to flood Europe, type it in, you'll get infowars.com
[12:03.600 --> 12:11.840]  and zero hedge first from 2014, four years ago, five years ago, you'll get with their
[12:11.840 --> 12:15.840]  announcements, us writing about it, then it was in the Daily Mail and the Associated Press
[12:15.840 --> 12:21.320]  a few years later, we did the flashback today, flashback, US may have let dozens of terrorists
[12:21.320 --> 12:26.360]  in the country's refugees, yeah that's nothing, type in this exactly and then put infowars.com
[12:26.360 --> 12:30.740]  on the end of it and click web, you're clicking news, you're getting new stuff, if you're
[12:30.740 --> 12:37.560]  radio listening, we're on TV too, I'm directing them, type in ISIS announces plan to use refugees
[12:37.560 --> 12:42.640]  to flood Europe, there it is, that's September 8, 2015, that's one of the older ones, flashback,
[12:42.640 --> 12:50.200]  ISIS threatens to send 500,000 migrants to Europe as psychological weapon, they go on
[12:50.200 --> 12:56.720]  to announce embedded within them are ISIS fighters, now estimated 3,000 in England,
[12:56.720 --> 13:03.440]  500 plots they have stopped or that are ongoing, that was last week, so again, we're acting
[13:03.440 --> 13:08.600]  like this is a mystery, we said, you're bringing in people out of failed Syria, failed Libya,
[13:08.600 --> 13:13.520]  where our governments went, funded the revolutions to overthrow secular governments in Egypt
[13:13.520 --> 13:18.040]  as well, then put radicals in charge that blow up every church, murder every Christian,
[13:18.040 --> 13:25.640]  kill every Jew, every Shiite, every non-radical Muslim, they can get their hands on, and I'm
[13:25.640 --> 13:28.840]  not saying all the Shiites aren't radical, some of them aren't radical but they're nothing
[13:28.840 --> 13:34.720]  compared to the Wahhabis, because 80% of Islam is Sunni, and the whip, the guy keeping it
[13:34.720 --> 13:42.080]  in line is the Wahhabis, that's the Gestapo of Islam, that's the enforcer, that's the
[13:42.080 --> 13:47.440]  head choppers, that's the sell the girls into sex slavery people, and you see this bizarre
[13:47.440 --> 13:53.200]  behavior where we're told, go along with it, give in to it, submit to it, they'll be nice
[13:53.200 --> 13:59.080]  if you just shut up, and all over the world, Italy, and everywhere else is flooded with
[13:59.080 --> 14:03.440]  millions and millions and millions, and look at the photos, look at the videos, none of
[14:03.440 --> 14:07.880]  them are women, I looked at big old jumbo photos this weekend, you know those giant
[14:07.880 --> 14:12.720]  megapixel ones you can blow up and zoom in, and I was looking at one of a whole shipload
[14:12.720 --> 14:21.040]  getting off of like over a thousand people, and I saw one woman, one woman, one woman,
[14:21.040 --> 14:26.280]  we're talking one out of a thousand, I mean it is crazy, but when you see the news, it's
[14:26.280 --> 14:30.000]  the few women of the few children, they'll have a photo op with a dead baby, it turns
[14:30.000 --> 14:37.680]  out staged, you know on the Italian coast or the coast of places like Greece, and then
[14:37.680 --> 14:43.560]  Soros is admittedly, with thousands of boat rides a week, has these huge Zodiac boats,
[14:43.560 --> 14:48.440]  rubber boats, 100 feet long one, back and forth, wading just 10 miles off of Libya in
[14:48.440 --> 14:54.320]  international waters, shepherding them funded by the Islamic groups to do it, and U.S.
[14:54.320 --> 15:02.440]  taxpayers, and E.U. money, taxpayers are paying to bring this in to create a class of civilization
[15:02.440 --> 15:08.080]  so that they can then say, we've got to regulate the Internet, we've got to take free speech,
[15:08.080 --> 15:13.360]  there it is Soros linked undesirable NGOs funded ISIS linked refugee boats to E.U., there
[15:13.360 --> 15:19.320]  it is, it links to mainstream news, show, you bring them in, they create the crisis,
[15:19.320 --> 15:23.160]  oh we've got to get rid of Internet freedom now, something Soros openly said he wants,
[15:23.160 --> 15:27.480]  oh we've got to have an international group do it, oh we've got to take your rights away
[15:27.480 --> 15:31.120]  now, we've got to set up checkpoints on the highways, but we're going to bring in more
[15:31.120 --> 15:36.000]  of the Islamists, and I'm not bashing May or even the police themselves, the cops I
[15:36.000 --> 15:40.640]  talked to, the FBI I talked to, get this, they get that it's treason at the top, but
[15:40.640 --> 15:46.280]  even the right-wing response of May is actually a response to take U.K. citizens' rights
[15:46.280 --> 15:51.520]  when the problem is letting these jihadists go back and forth to Libya where the bombers
[15:51.520 --> 15:55.800]  and attackers have been from and other Islamic countries.
[15:55.800 --> 16:01.040]  We'll be back with so much, ladies and gentlemen, I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com.

[19:33.200 --> 19:37.760]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you I felt incredible, like I haven't felt sweet.
[19:37.760 --> 19:43.920]  My morning was fantastic and I love the guys, I love the info wars crew and I just want
[19:43.920 --> 19:48.480]  to say yeah I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence
[19:48.480 --> 19:52.920]  just buy it, you will love it, I'm telling you I've never bought a bad product.
[19:52.920 --> 19:57.160]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at infowarslife.com
[19:57.160 --> 20:23.440]  It's a win-win at infowarslife.com You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:23.440 --> 20:27.000]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[20:27.000 --> 20:28.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[20:28.000 --> 20:34.480]  See the multinationals admit this, it's just come out in the news lately that Facebook
[20:34.480 --> 20:42.920]  targets insecure basically people that don't have a good family life or no family life at
[20:42.920 --> 20:43.920]  all.
[20:43.920 --> 20:50.120]  They try to turn them into liberals by manipulating their psychology to make them think that Facebook
[20:50.120 --> 20:53.960]  and things like that are their family and actually cares about them so they can then
[20:53.960 --> 20:59.240]  exploit them with getting them further into a bad position.
[20:59.240 --> 21:04.040]  And so the left is all about betrayal, it's all about being poor, it's all about thinking
[21:04.040 --> 21:09.600]  it's cool to be poor and it's all about wanting to pull down the middle class and make other
[21:09.600 --> 21:13.440]  people as poor as you are.
[21:13.440 --> 21:17.400]  This is just the cold-blooded psychological warfare system of the elites so of course
[21:17.400 --> 21:22.840]  George Soros one of the greatest dirt bags the world's ever seen has pumped tens of billions
[21:22.840 --> 21:33.080]  of dollars into funding Orthodox radical Islam spreading because it's cancer, it destroys
[21:33.080 --> 21:34.640]  everything it touches.
[21:34.640 --> 21:38.400]  He's always trying to crash currencies, he's always trying to bring down Western countries,
[21:38.400 --> 21:39.480]  you ask why?
[21:39.480 --> 21:48.480]  Because he is a truly despicable, horrible person, he's a demon and he overthrew the
[21:48.480 --> 21:54.240]  elected government Ukraine, he's trying to start World War 3 with Russia, Russia's fighting
[21:54.240 --> 22:01.940]  radical Islam so he is it longer heads with them because he supports anything truly cancerous
[22:01.940 --> 22:04.960]  because it's his nature.
[22:04.960 --> 22:09.800]  And so that's what's happening at the higher levels, the lower levels the left are just
[22:09.800 --> 22:15.840]  capitulators and so they see Christians and conservatives in the way of them conquering
[22:15.840 --> 22:23.080]  America and getting control of the middle class as a milk cow, as their food, as their
[22:23.080 --> 22:30.360]  slaves and the parasite sees Islam as radical and pushy but it's outside, it's not America,
[22:30.360 --> 22:34.680]  it's not Christian, they've been trained to hate America, hate Christianity, the minorities
[22:34.680 --> 22:38.040]  many of which have been trained to be racist is very very sad, the whites have been trained
[22:38.040 --> 22:43.960]  to kind of control and manipulate that, they're liberals and so Islam is a natural ally in
[22:43.960 --> 22:47.800]  this delusional behavior.
[22:47.800 --> 22:53.440]  And now they brought in the incompatible Islamist and now the social engineering starts, oh
[22:53.440 --> 22:57.360]  you've got to accept Islam, you've got to wear her jibs, you've got to make it fashionable,
[22:57.360 --> 23:01.960]  you've got to give into it, you've got to not criticize it or it'll kill you, you haven't
[23:01.960 --> 23:07.320]  been tolerant enough that's why this happens, so even during the knifing and you know running
[23:07.320 --> 23:13.720]  over folks with cars, I've got clips here where SJW, a social justice warrior, a trendy
[23:13.720 --> 23:18.880]  in London rebukes a fellow citizen inside a restaurant in London as police enter the
[23:18.880 --> 23:24.680]  premises in pursuit of three jihadists wielding knives, one person shouts those Muslim efforts
[23:24.680 --> 23:31.520]  to which the SJW says don't shout that you expletive idiot, it's not all Muslims.
[23:31.520 --> 23:37.480]  So you are in a restaurant with guys with knives stabbing people and you're worried about saying
[23:37.480 --> 23:44.760]  the effing Muslim went that way, I mean you can't go to the Muslim nations and be a Christian
[23:44.760 --> 23:50.080]  and even walk down the street, you can't go to many areas of London or Brussels, Belgium
[23:50.080 --> 23:54.160]  or Paris, France and walk around, we've proven that with our own reporters but that's okay
[23:54.160 --> 23:58.080]  because they don't have to be accepting, you see a woman walking around in areas alone
[23:58.080 --> 24:02.240]  out of hood over her head, they'll beat the living snot out of her, that's okay because
[24:02.240 --> 24:09.560]  that's their culture and we're supposed to accept the most radical forms of Islam that
[24:09.560 --> 24:18.720]  is dominating Islam right now, that is the referendum, that is the reformation, people
[24:18.720 --> 24:24.640]  say where is the reformation of Islam, you're seeing Islam and they're going right back
[24:24.640 --> 24:30.800]  to the fundamentals of the Quran and what it's said to do.
[24:30.800 --> 24:36.120]  Now I've read the Quran, Muhammad would say you can do it this way or you can do it that
[24:36.120 --> 24:41.160]  way, people say it's kind of schizophrenic, no I mean the Bible does that too where it's
[24:41.160 --> 24:48.120]  like it's multifaceted, there's different ways to do things but there's people interpreting
[24:48.120 --> 24:52.920]  the Quran where they can lie, cheat, steal, kill whoever they want, everything in the
[24:52.920 --> 24:59.200]  house of Islam is the house of Islam, everything else outside of it is the house of war and
[24:59.200 --> 25:04.720]  Islam because its populations double the last 30 years, oh yeah they've gone from 700 million
[25:04.720 --> 25:10.160]  to 1.4 million Muslims conservatively, it's about to be 3 billion, most of the world's
[25:10.160 --> 25:18.000]  population growth as it goes from 7.5 to 10 billion is going to be Muslim, so of course
[25:18.000 --> 25:22.200]  the globalists have teamed up with it, it's the future, you didn't have kids, the average
[25:22.200 --> 25:31.880]  Muslims have 4 kids, the average Japanese 1.2, mommy and daddy have on average 1.2 children,
[25:31.880 --> 25:37.640]  Italy 1.3, Italy's gone, okay, what do you replace it with, uneducated North African
[25:37.640 --> 25:45.880]  Muslims, men, who literally wiped their butt with their hands, I mean this is what, George
[25:45.880 --> 25:51.320]  Soros is going to program the future of the world, why don't they bring in Brazilians
[25:51.320 --> 25:55.360]  or something to repopulate Europe, I don't care if they're brown people, just not kill
[25:55.360 --> 26:01.200]  all the women, run around and blow everything up, but see the globalists want Islam because
[26:01.200 --> 26:06.560]  it's anathetically anti-western which creates middle classes, creates true liberalism and
[26:06.560 --> 26:14.680]  the globalists can't compete with that, I've got a few clips I want to play, here is Saquid
[26:14.680 --> 26:19.360]  Khan, the new London Stan Islamic mayor, who's invited in Muslims and said, I'm no
[26:19.360 --> 26:25.240]  local Tom, you really said that, I'm going to call for Islamic takeover, every attack
[26:25.240 --> 26:29.160]  he says oh it's no big deal, get used to it, it's part of life, a few weeks ago at the
[26:29.160 --> 26:35.680]  theater bombing, we played that clip at the Grande concert, the new one is, no need to
[26:35.680 --> 26:40.320]  be alarmed, London's safest global city for firearm deaths, but it's one of the most dangerous
[26:40.320 --> 26:45.920]  for mugging's rape attacks, I mean it's legendarily dangerous for getting mugged, anybody read
[26:45.920 --> 26:50.160]  Oliver Twist, hundreds of years ago they do, it's a dangerous city, you don't want to
[26:50.160 --> 26:55.080]  walk around in certainty in most areas after night time, or you better look like you know
[26:55.080 --> 27:00.960]  what you're doing, he says no need to worry, everything's wonderful by the way, more Muslims,
[27:00.960 --> 27:05.080]  more more more, and then he'll play the part as the conciliatory, oh I'm the nice Muslim,
[27:05.080 --> 27:09.600]  we need to tap down on these, but let's all celebrate Islam, let's accept Islam, come
[27:09.600 --> 27:12.960]  together, that means the Muslims will stop killing us if we just are nice to it, and
[27:12.960 --> 27:16.680]  the Westerners go yeah, we'll bend over to it, teach our daughters how to wear her jibs,
[27:16.680 --> 27:21.520]  just you know, at culture days, he's like yes, good friend, you know what you'll do,
[27:21.520 --> 27:29.800]  ha ha ha, and then they admit this is the plan, because they don't want a melting pot,
[27:29.800 --> 27:32.000]  they want to take over, here it is.
[27:32.000 --> 27:37.800]  My message to Londoners and visitors to our great city is to be calm and vigilant today,
[27:37.800 --> 27:42.040]  you will see an increased police presence today, including armed officers and uniformed
[27:42.040 --> 27:48.600]  officers, there's no reason to be alarmed by this, we are the safest global city in
[27:48.600 --> 27:53.760]  the world, you saw last night as a consequence of our planning, appropriation, and the rehearsals
[27:53.760 --> 27:58.200]  that take place, the swift response from the emergency services, attacking the terrorists,
[27:58.200 --> 28:00.800]  but also helping the injured.
[28:00.800 --> 28:07.040]  The terrorist, he's going to keep us safe from the terrorist, it's like the IRA, you
[28:07.040 --> 28:10.880]  know, had Sinn Féin, it was the friendly, loving, good God, and the IRA was blowing
[28:10.880 --> 28:14.680]  stuff up and killing people, at least the IRA did want to chop your daughter's genitals
[28:14.680 --> 28:22.520]  off but a hood on her head, and there wasn't 1.4 billion of the IRA, and the IRA was their
[28:22.520 --> 28:26.840]  own country, they'd been conquered, they'd been taken over, so they were coming across
[28:26.840 --> 28:30.480]  and blowing up a few things over here to say get out of our country, and I'm not even endorsing
[28:30.480 --> 28:36.480]  that, the point is, the IRA were little sweetie pies with their agenda and their ideology
[28:36.480 --> 28:40.760]  compared to the Muslims, but they had their good cop, bad cop, is my point of bringing
[28:40.760 --> 28:46.640]  up the IRA, and Khan is the Sinn Féin of Islam, he's the nice guy, oh, oh, they just
[28:46.640 --> 28:50.320]  blew you up and killed you, I'm going to be nice to you, kiss my butt, and do whatever
[28:50.320 --> 28:55.760]  I say and the bad man won't kill you, okay, I'm not going to hurt you, but he is, got
[28:55.760 --> 29:00.840]  how that works, yeah Khan, we know who's calling the shots.

[29:14.000 --> 29:18.360]  Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade grown Arabica beans.

[30:25.240 --> 30:28.920]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life changing for me.
[30:28.920 --> 30:34.120]  Yeah, I've actually just run out of my superfemale, I had a few bottles at my house, and I've
[30:34.120 --> 30:39.600]  been taking it again, hitting the gym once again, very exciting, feeling great, looking
[30:39.600 --> 30:46.160]  good, and I know my hair is luxurious once again, so obviously the superfemale is amazing,

[31:59.920 --> 32:02.080]  That's InfowarsLife.com.
[32:02.080 --> 32:06.480]  More than two years ago, Infowars first told you about our research into what has been
[32:06.480 --> 32:08.480]  called the iodine conspiracy.
[32:08.480 --> 32:12.600]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can
[32:12.600 --> 32:17.760]  devastate IQ and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and
[32:17.760 --> 32:21.520]  adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[32:21.520 --> 32:25.200]  They took the good halogen-L and put the deadly halogen in.
[32:25.200 --> 32:29.760]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling
[32:29.760 --> 32:32.160]  you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[32:32.160 --> 32:37.640]  Now in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between
[32:37.640 --> 32:43.440]  iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation
[32:43.440 --> 32:45.040]  ever concerning iodine.
[32:45.040 --> 32:47.000]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[32:47.000 --> 32:51.240]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to
[32:51.240 --> 32:53.480]  any optimum health regimen.
[32:53.480 --> 33:05.120]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 Today at InfowarsLife.com, or by calling 888-253-3139.
[33:05.120 --> 33:17.600]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:17.600 --> 33:21.160]  Resistance to Pirates is obedience to God.
[33:21.160 --> 33:22.160]  It's Alex Jones.
[33:22.160 --> 33:23.160]  Say you're the bottom line.
[33:23.160 --> 33:30.160]  This is how Islam's worked for 1,400 years, or longer, 1,500 years.
[33:30.160 --> 33:43.320]  Starting in and around Mecca and where the different Chilt Road trade caravan routes
[33:43.320 --> 33:54.960]  came together, a very small group of Bedouin slave traders basically codified a religion
[33:54.960 --> 33:58.520]  by amalgamating a bunch of the religions, Christianity, Judaism, and other things that
[33:58.520 --> 34:08.520]  were crossing there at the trade routes there at those four corners.
[34:08.520 --> 34:16.200]  And Islam always expands, acts friendly when it's on outskirts by new groups, infiltrates,
[34:16.200 --> 34:22.320]  moves in, gets a stronghold, and once they hit about 10%, they start killing everybody,
[34:22.320 --> 34:27.160]  including Muslims that don't want to go along with it, so that the other people in the towns
[34:27.160 --> 34:34.840]  and cities that they've invaded start moving out and pushing into other areas.
[34:34.840 --> 34:35.840]  It's very simple.
[34:35.840 --> 34:40.160]  They come in, they move in, they act all friendly, they tell you, oh, we're not the radical Muslims,
[34:40.160 --> 34:44.320]  then as soon as their numbers get to 10%, it's always the same, the terror attacks start,
[34:44.320 --> 34:49.400]  then there's the loving local Muslims that tell you, oh, we're trying to fight this, just
[34:49.400 --> 34:54.880]  submit to us, go along, come to the mosque, learn about what real Islam is, Stockholm
[34:54.880 --> 35:00.480]  syndrome basically, join us and we won't kill you, or the bad guys won't kill you, so they
[35:00.480 --> 35:06.600]  recruit while they know some won't be recruited, they will flee first the neighborhood, then
[35:06.600 --> 35:11.880]  the town, then the city, then the state, then the country, and that's fine.
[35:11.880 --> 35:18.000]  They then come in and take over the buildings and farms and castles and factories and facilities
[35:18.000 --> 35:21.760]  you've built.
[35:21.760 --> 35:27.680]  And once they get up to about 30%, they didn't have a tax levied on non-Muslims living in
[35:27.680 --> 35:33.600]  the area, but then once they get up to about 50%, they go ahead and drive you out or kill
[35:33.600 --> 35:35.080]  you.
[35:35.080 --> 35:37.240]  And this is in the Quran how to do it.
[35:37.240 --> 35:44.080]  It is a takeover plan by a guy that took over much of Saudi Arabia, what's Saudi Arabia
[35:44.080 --> 35:48.280]  today before he died.
[35:48.280 --> 35:53.720]  So it is an exact plan, you can go read the book he wrote, and you can go read the books
[35:53.720 --> 35:58.480]  that then the other Imams and folks wrote under two different schools.
[35:58.480 --> 36:03.120]  You have the Shiites who believe you've got to be directly related to the Prophet Muhammad,
[36:03.120 --> 36:07.000]  of course that's the minority group because you don't have as many preachers because there's
[36:07.000 --> 36:10.920]  not as many folks related to Muhammad.
[36:10.920 --> 36:15.680]  That's why you look at the Ayatollahs and Iran and stuff, they all look the same because
[36:15.680 --> 36:16.960]  they're related to Muhammad.
[36:16.960 --> 36:24.880]  I mean that direct royal religious lineage of Muhammad, you're looking at it.
[36:24.880 --> 36:29.360]  The Shiites were a lot smarter, they weren't going to follow what Muhammad said, but anybody
[36:29.360 --> 36:36.800]  that's a teacher and popular can lead and they've taken over, a little bit smarter ideology.
[36:36.800 --> 36:39.520]  We don't care if you're black, we don't care if you're white, we don't care if you're
[36:39.520 --> 36:43.040]  Asian, we don't care if you're Hispanic, we don't care if you're Native American, you
[36:43.040 --> 36:48.600]  can get a big following, you can become an Imam, you can lead a Jihad.
[36:48.600 --> 36:51.720]  That's why a lot of former white supremacists in Europe are converting to Islam, they see
[36:51.720 --> 36:54.560]  the writing on the wall, they want to be in a gang, they want to have all the women as
[36:54.560 --> 36:58.880]  their slaves, they're becoming leaders in it and you know what, the Wahhabis go, we want
[36:58.880 --> 37:00.280]  white guys running it.
[37:00.280 --> 37:04.120]  You can kind of say it's really not racist, the left kind of allies with it because it
[37:04.120 --> 37:06.960]  thinks it's anti-white, that's not really what you're looking at.
[37:06.960 --> 37:14.080]  That's why most of the big leaders now in Europe and the U.S. are white Muslim leaders.
[37:14.080 --> 37:18.080]  You'll see a lot of their testimonies online, they're like, I was in prison, 22 in the
[37:18.080 --> 37:23.960]  Aryan nations didn't know what to do and then I heard the E-mom and now I'm 40 years old
[37:23.960 --> 37:28.920]  and I run a big mosque and my life's good, bless it be the prophet.
[37:28.920 --> 37:37.240]  You're just like, wow, wow, this is dangerous, this is dangerous.
[37:37.240 --> 37:41.160]  But see, Western governments are thinking, just the next few decades, takeover wise,
[37:41.160 --> 37:47.640]  they think they can mop up Islam later and they want to be allied with Islam so that
[37:47.640 --> 37:51.880]  they can use it again to take our rights, take our liberties, take our free speech online,
[37:51.880 --> 37:57.120]  ban everybody's free speech, instead of just banning Orthodox radical Muslims coming in.
[37:57.120 --> 38:01.160]  And that's what may open international groups to control the Internet.
[38:01.160 --> 38:06.400]  Well that's already what Obama and Soros did before Obama left office.
[38:06.400 --> 38:09.920]  They're recruiting in the mosque.
[38:09.920 --> 38:13.760]  The main ideology comes out of the Internet, it's true, big Internet providers let ISIS
[38:13.760 --> 38:18.600]  and Al Qaeda push their garbage and then when I put out a video criticizing them, YouTube,
[38:18.600 --> 38:23.880]  it's Google and Facebook, it's Zuckerberg and Twitter routinely banned my videos and
[38:23.880 --> 38:29.160]  say you're promoting hate by simply showing what the Muslims are doing.
[38:29.160 --> 38:32.760]  We don't even show them cutting the heads off, we just show their statements, how they're
[38:32.760 --> 38:40.400]  going to kill us, how they're going to get all the women.
[38:40.400 --> 38:42.920]  So if you want to know how they operate, that's how they do it.
[38:42.920 --> 38:46.440]  Now I've got some other clips I want to play.
[38:46.440 --> 38:49.280]  Here's Nigel Evans, why do they hate Trump so much?
[38:49.280 --> 38:55.200]  Remember the British Parliament, he's saying why do they hate him so much?
[38:55.200 --> 38:58.360]  Because he remembers the forgotten people and that's what Trump's doing.
[38:58.360 --> 39:02.400]  Trump's bringing America back, he's promoting the basic system that made us the greatest
[39:02.400 --> 39:07.200]  country on earth and we see incredible job numbers, incredible stock market numbers,
[39:07.200 --> 39:11.080]  incredible new business numbers, despite the fact they're doing everything they can to
[39:11.080 --> 39:16.720]  stop him because Trump isn't out to get us and Trump is anti-globalist and Trump is
[39:16.720 --> 39:20.560]  the real deal.
[39:20.560 --> 39:24.360]  The proof is in the pudding and that's why the Islamists and the corrupt Pope and all
[39:24.360 --> 39:25.360]  of them hate him.
[39:25.360 --> 39:30.840]  A global carbon tax, 100 trillion per decade, paid to the UN and private interest and the
[39:30.840 --> 39:38.400]  US and Europe are the only ones have to implement, but 167 countries like China have zero cuts.
[39:38.400 --> 39:44.480]  It's total deindustrialization, Trump's 100% right, he's just not trying to kill the country.
[39:44.480 --> 39:48.200]  It's a no-brainer and thank God he gave that incredible speech on Thursday.
[39:48.200 --> 39:50.720]  I couldn't believe how powerful it was.
[39:50.720 --> 39:59.880]  I want to play a report dealing with the ISIS sympathizers like the left and the folks covering
[39:59.880 --> 40:02.600]  up for Islam, do they really know what they're doing?
[40:02.600 --> 40:06.200]  Because despite all Bill Maher's problems, at least he realizes Islam's a threat.
[40:06.200 --> 40:09.280]  But all the rest of them won't say a word.
[40:09.280 --> 40:11.440]  We've got a report on Kathy Griffin.
[40:11.440 --> 40:19.040]  It's very powerful by John Bowne that we'll be getting to and premiering here on air.
[40:19.040 --> 40:22.880]  Now to continue here, I want to just take a few minutes out to break something down
[40:22.880 --> 40:23.880]  here.
[40:23.880 --> 40:26.720]  Then we're going to take calls by the way in the second hour.
[40:26.720 --> 40:29.560]  We extended the Memorial Day specials through this weekend.
[40:29.560 --> 40:31.000]  They're going to end tomorrow.
[40:31.000 --> 40:35.600]  I can't have them go to Tuesday because Secret 12, the methylcobalamin vitamin B12 already
[40:35.600 --> 40:36.600]  sold out.
[40:36.600 --> 40:39.600]  Survival Shield, as I told you, is continually selling out.
[40:39.600 --> 40:44.240]  That's getting harder and harder to get the deep earth, super high quality I9 crystals
[40:44.240 --> 40:45.960]  that nobody else has got.
[40:45.960 --> 40:49.880]  We've got the BrainForce Neutropic, super high quality, knockout sleep aids, amazing,
[40:49.880 --> 40:53.120]  50% off, all natural.
[40:53.120 --> 40:58.240]  We're talking 65% off colloidal silver, 30% off supermobile vitality, Survival Shield
[40:58.240 --> 41:03.880]  back in stock, 40% off, BrainForce 47% off, knockout 50, all Trump t-shirts to get them
[41:03.880 --> 41:08.480]  out there, even though they're selling really good right now, at cost 75% off.
[41:08.480 --> 41:11.520]  Because normally they're $19.95.
[41:11.520 --> 41:13.600]  They cost us $5, so that's $5.
[41:13.600 --> 41:17.960]  We're selling them at costinfowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[41:17.960 --> 41:23.720]  But when we discount stuff like this, we need to sell a lot of it to be able to fund the
[41:23.720 --> 41:24.720]  operation.
[41:24.720 --> 41:27.800]  Z Shield's our great heavy metal detoxer, the Dr. Group developed.
[41:27.800 --> 41:30.080]  We just got that in about three weeks ago.
[41:30.080 --> 41:33.080]  It's going to sell out soon, five star reviews.
[41:33.080 --> 41:34.240]  Thousands and thousands of reviews.
[41:34.240 --> 41:38.880]  Dr. Oplex is like the, not really the poor man's, but it's the dry version.
[41:38.880 --> 41:44.520]  It's even stronger per capita, but it's less in price, supermobile vitality.
[41:44.520 --> 41:50.200]  We've got Biome Defense, the amazing probiotic developed by Dr. Group, InfoWarsLife.com.
[41:50.200 --> 41:56.320]  We have a BioPCA, hair and nail formula, Prostaguard, all of it available, oxy powder, flush the
[41:56.320 --> 41:59.040]  guts out naturally with high level oxygen.
[41:59.040 --> 42:10.560]  We have oil oregano from the Mediterranean, the highest quality, InfoWarsLife.com or 888-253-3139.
[42:10.560 --> 42:13.600]  We've got it in this special because some of the stuff I just mentioned sold out.
[42:13.600 --> 42:18.280]  In fact, they were good about actually taking that off here because that is sold out.
[42:18.280 --> 42:23.760]  Good job, Tim, came in on Sunday to take that off this plug because it sold out Saturday.
[42:23.760 --> 42:28.120]  That's pure methylcobalamin, highest quality organic.
[42:28.120 --> 42:29.120]  That's the same stuff you inject.
[42:29.120 --> 42:33.120]  I'm not saying inject it because it's not certified from the pharmacist to do that,
[42:33.120 --> 42:36.600]  but it's legal to get non-prescription when it's the pure methylcobalamin when you take
[42:36.600 --> 42:38.840]  it under your tongue.
[42:38.840 --> 42:39.840]  Just drip it on there.
[42:39.840 --> 42:40.840]  That's sold out.
[42:40.840 --> 42:45.800]  A lot of this stuff is going to sell out at these prices, InfoWarsLife.com or 888-253-3139.
[42:45.800 --> 42:52.000]  We also have the new personal care shampoo, zinc oxide sunscreen and more, and Emmerich's
[42:52.000 --> 42:53.000]  Essentials.
[42:53.000 --> 42:55.320]  That's 25% off when you sign up for auto ship.
[42:55.320 --> 43:01.000]  Anything else is 10% off, so that'd be 75% off on Coil Silver.
[43:01.000 --> 43:05.360]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[43:05.360 --> 43:10.080]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[43:10.080 --> 43:11.600]  to detoxify the body.
[43:11.600 --> 43:16.480]  That's why I'm introducing Z Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[43:16.480 --> 43:18.000]  It's made in the USA.
[43:18.000 --> 43:22.920]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[43:22.920 --> 43:24.760]  the body and it supports the InfoWars.
[43:24.760 --> 43:27.000]  It is a classical 360 win.
[43:27.000 --> 43:31.480]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe
[43:31.480 --> 43:36.160]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[43:36.160 --> 43:37.160]  get.
[43:37.160 --> 43:40.360]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this
[43:40.360 --> 43:45.400]  country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
[43:45.400 --> 43:50.640]  can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the
[43:50.640 --> 43:54.480]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be thanks to your support and your
[43:54.480 --> 43:55.480]  prayers together.
[43:55.480 --> 43:56.480]  We're changing the world.
[43:56.480 --> 44:00.760]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z Shield and InfoWarsLife.com.
[44:00.760 --> 44:02.640]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[44:02.640 --> 44:04.640]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[44:04.640 --> 44:07.520]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[44:07.520 --> 44:13.560]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[44:13.560 --> 44:18.520]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure Groundbreaking
[44:18.520 --> 44:23.560]  Water Filtration Systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze, whether it's your home or
[44:23.560 --> 44:24.560]  office.
[44:24.560 --> 44:28.720]  You owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children, to the best job you
[44:28.720 --> 44:30.320]  can to purify your air.
[44:30.320 --> 44:35.360]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate
[44:35.360 --> 44:38.320]  or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[44:38.320 --> 44:40.520]  The general public doesn't.
[44:40.520 --> 44:44.480]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[44:44.480 --> 44:48.120]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[44:48.120 --> 44:51.680]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house replacing older, more
[44:51.680 --> 44:54.880]  expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[44:54.880 --> 45:23.880]  Check out why this system is so revolutionary today, and then fullwarstore.com.
[45:23.880 --> 45:53.720]  Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.
[45:53.720 --> 45:57.800]  You can support the broadcast, infowarslives.com, thank you Dr. Group from the Global Healing
[45:57.800 --> 45:58.800]  Center.
[45:58.800 --> 46:01.800]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[46:01.800 --> 46:03.600]  Emdix Essentials, that's my middle name.
[46:03.600 --> 46:09.920]  I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand that's already
[46:09.920 --> 46:15.280]  trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's organic
[46:15.280 --> 46:16.280]  and high quality.
[46:16.280 --> 46:22.480]  This is one of the top three selling organic brands in the country that puts out high quality
[46:22.480 --> 46:25.440]  organic shampoo, mouthwash, you name it.
[46:25.440 --> 46:29.960]  And if they're such patriots, they have let us basically keep their well-known packaging.
[46:29.960 --> 46:33.920]  It is an answer to prayer, and because we're cutting up the middleman, 20% off retail,
[46:33.920 --> 46:37.120]  sign up for auto-ship, an additional 25% off.
[46:37.120 --> 46:38.200]  It's all there.
[46:38.200 --> 46:43.640]  The body wash, the shampoo, the deodorant, the mouthwash, all of it is truly game-changing.
[46:43.640 --> 46:48.200]  It is the exact same product, just the name is different, Emdix Essentials, and it's
[46:48.200 --> 46:54.480]  on average 20% off what it would be in stores, buying it directly from infowarstore.com.
[46:54.480 --> 46:58.800]  Help us win the info war while getting product everybody needs, infowarslife.com, where
[46:58.800 --> 47:05.680]  you'll find the entire line of Emdix Essentials.
[47:05.680 --> 47:23.360]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:23.360 --> 47:28.920]  Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[47:28.920 --> 47:36.280]  All right, I want to open the phones up in the second hour on what happened at London
[47:36.280 --> 47:40.480]  Bridge, what happened with all the other car attacks and stabbing attacks and police being
[47:40.480 --> 47:46.360]  killed and bombings, little girls being blown up, and the left just covering it up constantly,
[47:46.360 --> 47:51.400]  Christians being murdered at escalation levels that are double what we just saw five years
[47:51.400 --> 47:52.400]  ago.
[47:52.400 --> 47:57.000]  Christians account for more than half of all religious persecution in the world, even according
[47:57.000 --> 48:00.160]  to the UN, and almost all of it is Islamic.
[48:00.160 --> 48:07.840]  So why is the left so allied with this, 877-789 Alex is the Sunday number to call 877-789-2539,
[48:07.840 --> 48:08.840]  877-789-2539.
[48:08.840 --> 48:15.400]  And if you're calling from England, you will go to the head of the line.
[48:15.400 --> 48:19.760]  So again, that's 877-789 Alex, there is the number.
[48:19.760 --> 48:23.480]  Now, I mentioned this earlier, I didn't get to it.
[48:23.480 --> 48:28.840]  Trump is being demonized and attacked because he's really doing what he said he'd do, or
[48:28.840 --> 48:34.480]  he's fighting hard to get it done, killing TPP, pulling us out of the Paris climate deal
[48:34.480 --> 48:39.880]  that was giant taxes and the shutdown of coal plants and power plants and factories only
[48:39.880 --> 48:41.120]  in Europe and America.
[48:41.120 --> 48:46.040]  But see, our elites had made deals with China and India and others, not for their people,
[48:46.040 --> 48:51.080]  but for the elites to go build the factories there in totally dirty conditions.
[48:51.080 --> 48:58.880]  And Trump had that spectacular press conference last week that we played clips of and carried
[48:58.880 --> 48:59.880]  live.
[48:59.880 --> 49:02.760]  It was just so amazing, wasn't it?
[49:02.760 --> 49:07.600]  To see that happen and to see the truth come out in a 45-minute press conference and it
[49:07.600 --> 49:12.560]  made them so mad and they're like, the headlines today are Trump stomping the earth, Trump
[49:12.560 --> 49:17.120]  killing the earth because of carbon dioxide that's at the lowest levels ever recorded
[49:17.120 --> 49:22.000]  in the last 50 years, used to be hundreds and hundreds of times higher.
[49:22.000 --> 49:28.400]  If you go back to the development of this planet, what plants live off of, then they
[49:28.400 --> 49:32.320]  produce the oxygen we live off of, the carbon cycle is almost broken.
[49:32.320 --> 49:40.320]  I've talked to top planetologists, top astrophesies, top climate experts.
[49:40.320 --> 49:48.000]  This is a Frank Herbert term for a climatologist and they all concur that we believe we're
[49:48.000 --> 49:52.520]  losing the atmosphere like Mars did some time in the distant past.
[49:52.520 --> 49:56.760]  So here's Nigel Evans, Trump is president, this is in parliament, takes a lot of courage
[49:56.760 --> 50:01.640]  to do this in the UK for actually doing what he said he'd do and he's really doing it.
[50:01.640 --> 50:06.760]  And he's got the whole corrupt elite, including Kathy Griffin throwing what they've got at
[50:06.760 --> 50:07.760]  him.
[50:07.760 --> 50:08.760]  Here it is.
[50:08.760 --> 50:15.560]  It's quite difficult to understand that the American people are voted for Donald Trump,
[50:15.560 --> 50:17.920]  get over it because he's president of the United States.
[50:17.920 --> 50:23.840]  And what I would say for all of us here, and this actually includes myself, is that we
[50:23.840 --> 50:32.560]  have to ask ourselves why is it that people felt so left behind that they made the democratic
[50:32.560 --> 50:37.720]  decisions that they've had, which we think we can't understand some of us.
[50:37.720 --> 50:41.000]  How can you possibly vote for Brexit, how can you possibly vote for Donald Trump and
[50:41.000 --> 50:43.360]  the fact is that the people have.
[50:43.360 --> 50:46.880]  These were the forgotten people and just like we had the forgotten people in the United
[50:46.880 --> 50:51.160]  Kingdom, there are the forgotten people in the United States of America.
[50:51.160 --> 50:54.480]  We may not like some of the things that he says and I certainly don't like some of the
[50:54.480 --> 50:59.960]  things that he's said in the past, but I do respect the fact that he stood on a platform
[50:59.960 --> 51:02.000]  which he is now delivering.
[51:02.000 --> 51:06.680]  He is going to go down in history as being roundly condemned for being the only politician
[51:06.680 --> 51:09.160]  to deliver on his promises.
[51:09.160 --> 51:10.840]  Powerful.
[51:10.840 --> 51:15.840]  Trump will go down in history as being roundly criticized for the only politician to deliver
[51:15.840 --> 51:22.480]  on his promises.
[51:22.480 --> 51:25.120]  I mean, yeah, he's 70 years old.
[51:25.120 --> 51:26.120]  He was wrong.
[51:26.120 --> 51:27.120]  The FBI was conning him.
[51:27.120 --> 51:28.400]  He's figured it out now.
[51:28.400 --> 51:31.960]  They're like, sir, we need to have at least the high levels conning him.
[51:31.960 --> 51:33.240]  We need to have the code.
[51:33.240 --> 51:36.840]  They won't give us the code to the iPhone of the San Bernardino attackers.
[51:36.840 --> 51:37.840]  He goes, we got a warrant.
[51:37.840 --> 51:38.840]  They're killers.
[51:38.840 --> 51:41.040]  Open the phone up, Apple.
[51:41.040 --> 51:42.040]  He didn't understand.
[51:42.040 --> 51:47.480]  They wanted the code to get in the back door without a warrant to everybody's phone.
[51:47.480 --> 51:48.480]  Trump was wrong about that.
[51:48.480 --> 51:49.720]  He's been wrong about torture.
[51:49.720 --> 51:53.160]  He says he admits he was wrong about that now.
[51:53.160 --> 51:54.160]  He's done more research.
[51:54.160 --> 52:00.040]  He's been wrong about a few other things, but he means well and it's so refreshing and
[52:00.040 --> 52:05.080]  all the special interests that have hijacked the country are angry.
[52:05.080 --> 52:06.480]  They don't like it.
[52:06.480 --> 52:11.080]  Meanwhile, she's coming here Tuesday and look, I'm doing this because it's a big show.
[52:11.080 --> 52:17.560]  It makes big news and I rarely do tape shows because they can really edit them deceptively,
[52:17.560 --> 52:23.480]  but I've decided to do media this month and the first thing I'm doing.
[52:23.480 --> 52:24.480]  I'm doing the view.
[52:24.480 --> 52:25.480]  I'm doing.
[52:25.480 --> 52:26.480]  I mean, you name it.
[52:26.480 --> 52:29.880]  They want me all on and I'm going to do it because those are all live.
[52:29.880 --> 52:31.560]  But first is Megan Kelly.
[52:31.560 --> 52:35.880]  She told me, you know, I'm going to interview Putin next week.
[52:35.880 --> 52:36.880]  I'm flying to Russia.
[52:36.880 --> 52:37.880]  Don't tell anybody.
[52:37.880 --> 52:38.880]  That was an offer discussion.
[52:38.880 --> 52:40.960]  And she said, but I want to talk to you right after.
[52:40.960 --> 52:45.040]  Well, now I can say it because you know, she got the Putin interview and she was next on
[52:45.040 --> 52:47.360]  Alex Jones and I'm not a heady person.
[52:47.360 --> 52:52.560]  I know why she wants it and I'm not going to get into it, but she basically told me
[52:52.560 --> 52:57.640]  that it's Alex Jones and it's Donald Trump.
[52:57.640 --> 53:02.600]  And I think she wants to show that she can be a little more non-biased so that she gets
[53:02.600 --> 53:10.480]  the Trump interview that he's been refusing for over a year.
[53:10.480 --> 53:15.840]  But then I see this display in St. Petersburg, I'm about to play where she hosted this deal
[53:15.840 --> 53:18.400]  that Putin was at and then she interviewed Putin as well.
[53:18.400 --> 53:24.960]  I mean, I talked to her days before she flew there and I love the media that makes this
[53:24.960 --> 53:28.520]  big thing like, oh, is she really coming as Jones lying?
[53:28.520 --> 53:29.520]  Jones is fake news.
[53:29.520 --> 53:30.520]  Excuse me.
[53:30.520 --> 53:31.520]  I've been on the view.
[53:31.520 --> 53:32.520]  I've been on Nightline.
[53:32.520 --> 53:34.400]  I've been on 60 Minutes.
[53:34.400 --> 53:37.400]  I was on 60 Minutes 20 years ago.
[53:37.400 --> 53:40.760]  Jay Leno was talking about me 20 years ago.
[53:40.760 --> 53:47.640]  I mean, I've sold 15 million DVDs.
[53:47.640 --> 53:53.000]  I mean, we're on 200 plus stations and I don't need to sit her and say I'm big.
[53:53.000 --> 53:57.520]  It's crazy to sit there and watch the media.
[53:57.520 --> 53:59.520]  Oh, it's more like 10 million.
[53:59.520 --> 54:00.520]  I'm sorry.
[54:00.520 --> 54:02.880]  I was counting some other stuff I sold, but my DVDs.
[54:02.880 --> 54:10.080]  I'm sitting there watching media all the time go, Internet host Alex Jones, Internet.
[54:10.080 --> 54:12.000]  I've dominated from the grassroots.
[54:12.000 --> 54:13.000]  That's a good thing.
[54:13.000 --> 54:16.080]  It's like saying Internet site drugs, the biggest in the world.
[54:16.080 --> 54:19.160]  He's pathetic though because he's on the Internet.
[54:19.160 --> 54:21.680]  I've been on talk radio for 21 years.
[54:21.680 --> 54:23.440]  I've been on air for 22.
[54:23.440 --> 54:25.960]  I'm on over 200 radio stations.
[54:25.960 --> 54:32.040]  But what does it mean to say I'm Internet, like the whole world isn't the Internet now,
[54:32.040 --> 54:34.520]  or that I didn't dominate grassroots myself?
[54:34.520 --> 54:36.240]  Isn't that a badge of courage?
[54:36.240 --> 54:37.240]  A badge of success?
[54:37.240 --> 54:40.800]  It's like saying Jones who didn't go to college.
[54:40.800 --> 54:42.200]  I'm proud of that.
[54:42.200 --> 54:44.080]  If you went to college, great for you.
[54:44.080 --> 54:46.680]  I did this with the help of my audience.
[54:46.680 --> 54:49.440]  We did this organically.
[54:49.440 --> 54:53.840]  I mean, I did go to college and it was a joke.
[54:53.840 --> 54:58.000]  The first year of RTF was learning about the history of radio, television, and film.
[54:58.000 --> 55:00.120]  It was like a total waste of time.
[55:00.120 --> 55:01.120]  I said, I'm out of here.
[55:01.120 --> 55:02.800]  I'm going to go intern in radio.
[55:02.800 --> 55:05.360]  It doesn't even matter anymore.
[55:05.360 --> 55:09.360]  The point is, is that I just love how Jones claims Megan Kelly, like this is the biggest
[55:09.360 --> 55:10.360]  thing.
[55:10.360 --> 55:11.360]  Oh my gosh.
[55:11.360 --> 55:12.360]  Dateline NBC.
[55:12.360 --> 55:17.800]  I've been on Dateline NBC three times already.
[55:17.800 --> 55:24.560]  I was on Dateline NBC 12 years ago the first time, or 13 years ago.
[55:24.560 --> 55:31.640]  Again, it's how they play these games like their Hollywood, their big time media, their
[55:31.640 --> 55:35.200]  you know, I almost didn't do the Megan Kelly thing.
[55:35.200 --> 55:39.800]  I almost hope she cancels why I'm even talking about this stuff because I just don't even
[55:39.800 --> 55:40.800]  want to do it.
[55:40.800 --> 55:44.800]  I got a lot of stuff going on here, but then it feels weird when you turn out hundreds
[55:44.800 --> 55:45.800]  of interviews.
[55:45.800 --> 55:54.400]  People do it to see what's going to happen, but then she goes and interviews Putin, Putin.
[55:54.400 --> 55:55.400]  We didn't protect Assad.
[55:55.400 --> 55:57.760]  We protect Syria from becoming Libya.
[55:57.760 --> 55:58.760]  Let's play that clip.
[55:58.760 --> 55:59.760]  Here it is.
[55:59.760 --> 56:04.400]  Shifting gears to Syria.
[56:04.400 --> 56:08.720]  Our president has said that you're backing an evil guy there.
[56:08.720 --> 56:10.920]  He said Assad is an evil guy.
[56:10.920 --> 56:19.120]  Do you believe that?
[56:19.120 --> 56:20.920]  Believe in what?
[56:20.920 --> 56:29.440]  That Assad is an evil man, an evil guy.
[56:29.440 --> 56:35.000]  You've got to ask the other leaders who have communicated with Assad.
[56:35.000 --> 56:40.080]  He was more often in Europe after being elected than in Russia.
[56:40.080 --> 56:42.960]  That is not President Assad whom we are protecting there.
[56:42.960 --> 56:46.120]  We are protecting the Syrian statehood.
[56:46.120 --> 56:54.080]  We don't want that interior to be a situation similar to that in Libya or in Somalia or
[56:54.080 --> 56:55.080]  in Afghanistan.
[56:55.080 --> 56:59.080]  And Afghanistan needs has been present for many years, but this issue is not changing
[56:59.080 --> 57:00.440]  for the better.
[57:00.440 --> 57:08.800]  We want to preserve the Syrian statehood and on the basis of resolving this fundamental
[57:08.800 --> 57:14.600]  issue, we would like them to move towards settling the Syrian issue through political
[57:14.600 --> 57:15.600]  means.
[57:15.600 --> 57:20.040]  Yes, probably everyone is there to blame for something, but let's not forget that were
[57:20.040 --> 57:27.280]  it not for inactive interference from outside, the civil war would probably not have broken
[57:27.280 --> 57:28.280]  it out.
[57:28.280 --> 57:29.280]  What is?
[57:29.280 --> 57:30.280]  And that's all true.
[57:30.280 --> 57:32.200]  I'm not some Putin guy.
[57:32.200 --> 57:33.200]  It's true.
[57:33.200 --> 57:35.080]  The globalists started the war six years ago.
[57:35.080 --> 57:38.400]  They funded al-Qaeda and then ISIS to go in.
[57:38.400 --> 57:40.040]  Russia got invited in to stop it.
[57:40.040 --> 57:45.080]  Our military agreed, blocked Obama and what Putin did and what Russia did was a good thing
[57:45.080 --> 57:47.800]  for everybody and no one can deny it.
[57:47.800 --> 57:50.080]  Our two, your phone calls so much more coming up.
[57:50.080 --> 57:51.080]  Tell folks tune in.
[57:51.080 --> 57:54.520]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling super blue fluoride toothpaste is now back
[57:54.520 --> 57:56.800]  in stock at infowarstore.com.
[57:56.800 --> 57:58.600]  Research across the board is clear.
[57:58.600 --> 58:02.560]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood
[58:02.560 --> 58:03.920]  clots and heart attacks.

[58:22.960 --> 58:25.480]  bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.

[58:30.120 --> 58:35.000]  peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more due to requests from listeners who found that
[58:35.000 --> 58:37.480]  spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children.

[59:34.360 --> 59:39.600]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant derived or of the highest
[59:39.600 --> 59:41.320]  quality lab standard.
[59:41.320 --> 59:45.320]  That means it's clean, that means it's pure and rest secured you're finding the tip of
[59:45.320 --> 59:46.680]  the spear in the info war.
[59:46.680 --> 59:49.560]  That's infowarslife.com and vitamin mineral fusion.
[59:49.560 --> 59:55.600]  We'll catch you now before we sell out.
[59:55.600 --> 59:58.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[59:58.160 --> 1:00:08.080]  All right your phone calls, Judy and Julie and others are coming up right after this
[1:00:08.080 --> 1:00:11.960]  short segment but first I have an important report on Kathy Griffin.
[1:00:11.960 --> 1:00:15.920]  The lady that thinks beheading is so cute.
[1:00:15.920 --> 1:00:21.200]  This president of all people is going to come after me, he picked the wrong redhead and
[1:00:21.200 --> 1:00:24.640]  he's sort of a redhead miss although it's sort of like a parfait cup.
[1:00:24.640 --> 1:00:28.400]  I made fun of Clinton, oh god remember the Monica dress days, those were the days.
[1:00:28.400 --> 1:00:32.640]  You could make dress jokes all day long and nobody tried to kill you.
[1:00:32.640 --> 1:00:36.560]  You shouldn't have to die for this, I'm under a secret service investigation.
[1:00:36.560 --> 1:00:41.160]  Kathy Griffin it's a real good indication that your material is horrible when you have
[1:00:41.160 --> 1:00:43.680]  to hire a lawyer to defend it.
[1:00:43.680 --> 1:00:53.760]  It was a parody of Trump's own sexist remarks, taken to an extreme absurdist visual.
[1:00:53.760 --> 1:00:57.000]  Like many edgy works of artistic art, it's meant to look like ISIS garbage, it should
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:00:58.560]  be interpreted different ways.
[1:00:58.560 --> 1:01:01.560]  While the whole left calls for his death constantly.
[1:01:01.560 --> 1:01:06.120]  But Kathy, you're all calling for his death, you're all misinterpreted as a threat to violence
[1:01:06.120 --> 1:01:07.120]  and against Trump.
[1:01:07.120 --> 1:01:08.120]  You're all calling for his death.
[1:01:08.120 --> 1:01:09.120]  You're all calling for his death.
[1:01:09.120 --> 1:01:10.120]  You're all calling for his death.
[1:01:10.120 --> 1:01:11.120]  You're all calling for his death.
[1:01:11.120 --> 1:01:12.120]  You're all calling for his death.
[1:01:12.120 --> 1:01:15.280]  The police have stepped onto Griffin's sinking ship.
[1:01:15.280 --> 1:01:18.280]  Defending the plastic bubble that they all live in.
[1:01:18.280 --> 1:01:23.880]  Including poser Al Franken, Jamie Foxx, Larry King, Rosie O'Donnell, Jim Carrey.
[1:01:23.880 --> 1:01:28.080]  You know I had a dream the other night about that I was playing golf with Donald Trump
[1:01:28.080 --> 1:01:31.960]  and I was standing beside him with a club in my hand and I was you know considering
[1:01:31.960 --> 1:01:34.240]  my options when I suddenly woke up.
[1:01:34.240 --> 1:01:36.960]  You know it was one of those dreams where you want to just get back to sleep so you
[1:01:36.960 --> 1:01:39.620]  can finish it, you know.
[1:01:39.620 --> 1:02:07.320]  But the backlash has just begun.
[1:02:07.320 --> 1:02:12.260]  Ben Barr responded to the ensuing Griffin Barron Trump debacle saying,
[1:02:12.260 --> 1:02:15.420]  Two of my grandsons are Barron Trump's age.
[1:02:15.420 --> 1:02:19.540]  I would slap the f*** out of any bit more f*** who upset them.
[1:02:19.540 --> 1:02:20.980]  Trust me on that.
[1:02:20.980 --> 1:02:26.740]  Kathy Griffin, who lives in Bel Air next to the Kardashians, has no children and seems
[1:02:26.740 --> 1:02:31.180]  to actually detest them, which she has every right to do.
[1:02:31.180 --> 1:02:36.860]  But that isolates her from a huge majority of the population of the United States.
[1:02:36.860 --> 1:02:42.380]  Griffin, lacking any moral high ground, has taken a stand against President Trump for his
[1:02:42.380 --> 1:02:48.700]  grabber by the f*** bo-pah, yet goes on to promote her own act as being far more vulgar,
[1:02:48.700 --> 1:02:50.700]  especially to children.
[1:02:50.700 --> 1:02:54.540]  I'm also not appropriate for children, I would say, across the board.
[1:02:54.540 --> 1:02:59.820]  Trust me, when I used to do a joke in my act when I was doing clubs, some time someone
[1:02:59.820 --> 1:03:03.140]  would shout out, I've got a kid here, and I'd say, well, you're at the wrong f***ing
[1:03:03.140 --> 1:03:04.140]  place.
[1:03:04.140 --> 1:03:05.140]  I'm very open about that.
[1:03:05.140 --> 1:03:06.140]  I'm going to be honest.
[1:03:06.140 --> 1:03:07.140]  I'm going to be honest, I'm going to be honest.
[1:03:07.140 --> 1:03:08.140]  I'm going to be honest, I'm going to be honest.
[1:03:08.140 --> 1:03:09.140]  I'm going to be honest, I'm going to be honest.
[1:03:09.140 --> 1:03:10.140]  You broke me?
[1:03:10.140 --> 1:03:11.140]  You broke me?
[1:03:11.140 --> 1:03:12.140]  You broke me.
[1:03:12.140 --> 1:03:13.140]  And then I was like, no, this is right.
[1:03:13.140 --> 1:03:14.140]  This is not right.
[1:03:14.140 --> 1:03:19.140]  I apologize because that was the right thing to do when I mentioned it.
[1:03:19.140 --> 1:03:24.140]  And then I saw the tide turning and I saw what they were doing and I went, oh, okay,
[1:03:24.140 --> 1:03:26.140]  they're trying to spin this and they're making about baron.
[1:03:26.140 --> 1:03:28.140]  And obviously that was never my intent.
[1:03:28.140 --> 1:03:30.140]  It would never want to hurt anyone, much less a child.
[1:03:30.140 --> 1:03:35.140]  But I started to see what was really happening, and then it was a mob mentality pile-on.
[1:03:35.140 --> 1:03:40.140]  And so many people have expressed to me personally across the country at my shows, they're scared.
[1:03:40.140 --> 1:03:45.140]  So, yeah, I don't know what's, I don't know, I'm just gonna risk it to me, I don't know.
[1:03:45.140 --> 1:03:52.140]  Face it, Kathy. You just destroyed your career, and like Hillary Clinton, it's nobody's fault but your own.
[1:03:52.140 --> 1:04:02.140]  The Hollywood Hills aren't Congress. You and your ilk, Sarah Silverman, Meryl Streep, Robert De Niro, Cher, Lena Dunham, George Clooney,
[1:04:02.140 --> 1:04:10.140]  Jennifer Lawrence and Johnny Depp are actually endangering your careers regardless of what your agents are telling you.
[1:04:10.140 --> 1:04:19.140]  Just go take a look at Colin Kaepernick's current career status. The American people aren't buying what you're selling because your facts,
[1:04:19.140 --> 1:04:31.140]  much like Kathy Griffin's pointless train wreck of a career, don't resonate with the majority of the hardworking Americans that made you what you are in the first place.
[1:04:31.140 --> 1:04:36.140]  What is your opinion of that first amendment expression of you beheading Lisa Blue?
[1:04:36.140 --> 1:04:41.140]  Is there a question, is there a comment you would have about this image of beheading Lisa Blue?
[1:04:41.140 --> 1:04:48.140]  I wonder, this is the first amendment protected expression, and we really ought to make sure that nobody gets bullied as a result of this.
[1:04:48.140 --> 1:05:01.140]  JohnBoundForIfAwards.com
[1:05:01.140 --> 1:05:07.140]  Let's go to Devin and Florida. Devin and Florida you're on the air.
[1:05:07.140 --> 1:05:18.140]  Great. Hey, thank you so much. Listen, I have bought your product and I gotta say they're amazing. Anyone who's on the fence, buy it because I've got caveman,

[1:05:23.140 --> 1:05:28.140]  Wow, thank you. You're the type of listener that makes it all possible. Which pharmaceutical does you like best?
[1:05:28.140 --> 1:05:33.140]  I really like the vitamin mineral fusion to be honest. That's really incredible.
[1:05:33.140 --> 1:05:37.140]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible. I haven't felt sweet.
[1:05:37.140 --> 1:05:48.140]  My morning was fantastic and I love you guys. I love the InfoWars true and I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence,
[1:05:48.140 --> 1:05:52.140]  just buy it. We'll love it. I'm telling you, I've never bought a bad product.
[1:05:52.140 --> 1:06:03.140]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at infowarslife.com. It's a win-win infowarslife.com.
[1:06:03.140 --> 1:06:14.140]  You have the power. Humanity has the power. We have the power. Do you want to fight? You better believe you got one.
[1:06:14.140 --> 1:06:26.140]  Rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty. It's Alex Jones.
[1:06:26.140 --> 1:06:33.140]  So, Megan Shelley is coming here to interview me on Tuesday.
[1:06:33.140 --> 1:06:37.140]  I turned down most mainstream media interviews because I always got to travel to L.A. or New York to do it.
[1:06:37.140 --> 1:06:44.140]  I still do that anymore. We're all over the news every day. We're all over CNN, Fox News all the time.
[1:06:44.140 --> 1:06:50.140]  It really doesn't do anything because it always takes us out of context and they clip up what you've said.
[1:06:50.140 --> 1:07:01.140]  But it's a profile and I found on Nightline and 60 Minutes and other shows that when they do profiles on you, it tends to be somewhat worth it.
[1:07:01.140 --> 1:07:08.140]  But then I've seen Megan Kelly over in Russia and some of the things she's saying and doing and it's all just standard operating procedures.
[1:07:08.140 --> 1:07:17.140]  She's like, isn't Assad evil? Assad didn't start the war. Assad isn't al-Qaeda. Assad lets women go to college. It doesn't make him wear burqas.
[1:07:17.140 --> 1:07:26.140]  Assad was democratizing Syria just like Libya was and we used it to overthrow him via Obama and Hillary to bring in radical Muslims.
[1:07:26.140 --> 1:07:35.140]  That's the fact that all the left does and all the MSM is like Assad, you know, he's real evil.
[1:07:35.140 --> 1:07:42.140]  Why are we always throwing over overthrowing the secular governments? Why is that?
[1:07:42.140 --> 1:07:49.140]  They have a London terror attack and these happen all the time and the left makes excuses for them over and over and over again.
[1:07:49.140 --> 1:08:01.140]  I'm just sick of it. I don't see Islam as half the threat of the bureaucracy and the leftist that want to work with this and want to go along with this.
[1:08:01.140 --> 1:08:14.140]  And then ISIS says, activate, start running over and killing everybody and it happens more and more and more and more and more and then nothing is done about it.
[1:08:14.140 --> 1:08:23.140]  And then I go to the mall and I walk past Gap with my daughters. I'm about to walk in Gap because I don't care what's the big corporate name.
[1:08:23.140 --> 1:08:27.140]  It's got clothes that fit them and I see a big hijab and a woman and I'm like, well, I can't buy there.
[1:08:27.140 --> 1:08:30.140]  And I'm like, all of a sudden I'm walking my own shop. It's a hijab on that.
[1:08:30.140 --> 1:08:36.140]  And I realize the Muslim population is not even that high. The corporate media is saying, we're going to force feed you this.
[1:08:36.140 --> 1:08:44.140]  Remember, Dunkin' Donuts showed their spokeswoman in a hijab like six years ago. They went, that's not a hijab. We're not pushing the hijab.
[1:08:44.140 --> 1:08:51.140]  That's a conspiracy theory and now it's everywhere. And you can go to USA Today or the Associated Press just a few weeks ago.
[1:08:51.140 --> 1:08:59.140]  It's like women now wearing a hijab, a sign of solidarity with Islam. It's a sign that you're a slave, idiot.
[1:08:59.140 --> 1:09:11.140]  So again, it is the middle illness of the left and the social engineering we have to deal with and that people have to face and that the fact that Islamic attacks are being used to now take our freedoms.
[1:09:11.140 --> 1:09:23.140]  Now, let me answer this question that I'm going to your phone calls. Do I think Manchester and the killing of all the young women, the 22 and 50 plus injured of two weeks ago is an inside job?
[1:09:23.140 --> 1:09:28.140]  Do I think the attack of London Bridge last night was an inside job?
[1:09:28.140 --> 1:09:41.140]  Do I think all the truck attacks in France and in other countries of Europe like Sweden? Do I think that the governments themselves staged those?
[1:09:41.140 --> 1:09:45.140]  And the answer is absolutely they staged them.
[1:09:45.140 --> 1:09:54.140]  Oh no, they didn't actually fund the terrorists in some cases they did. They didn't actually go out and drive them in the truck, but they knew they were doing it.
[1:09:54.140 --> 1:10:04.140]  They let them go to Pakistan, they let them go to Libya, they let them go to Syria, they let them go to Iraq, they let them go to Saudi Arabia and get trained and go back and forth in every case.
[1:10:04.140 --> 1:10:23.140]  MI6, MI5, German intelligence, Swedish intelligence, US intelligence until Trump came along, he stopped that. They're there, they know what's going on, their agents try to stop it in the case of the Manchester attack and the case of this attack and the case of the Stockholm attack and the case of San Bernardino.
[1:10:23.140 --> 1:10:40.140]  Two years before they were going to Pakistan and other countries getting trained and the FBI opened an investigation up at their mosque on them and wanted to be able to continue surveillance and they were called up by the Justice Department in a civil rights criminal pro.
[1:10:40.140 --> 1:11:02.140]  And two FBI agents and one federal marshal were facing 10 years in prison in an internal investigation for civil rights violations. This came out in a few newspapers for investigating the San Bernardino husband and wife that went to the Christmas party, you know, the Christmas tree and said, are you a Christian?
[1:11:02.140 --> 1:11:16.140]  Yes, boom! Are you Jewish? Yes, boom! Because you got the Jews sitting around at the Christmas tree drinking eggnog, eating, you know, whatever. Big deal, we're all coming together. They killed the Jews, they killed the Christians.
[1:11:16.140 --> 1:11:37.140]  That's who they sought out. Workers they knew were Christian or Jewish. They would say, denounce it or you're dead. And they would say, I'm not denouncing it. Don't do this. And they'd shoot them right in the head. And our media, our media would not say that was an Islamic attack.
[1:11:37.140 --> 1:11:55.140]  And for three days, the FBI was ordered to say it wasn't until they finally came out and said, we've been told not to say it's an Islamic attack, but it is. And see, our government isn't perfect. But finally, Obama backing Al Qaeda and ISIS in Syria, backing Europe spring, the Soros crap, trying to law enforcement to stand down the last eight years to not do anything.
[1:11:55.140 --> 1:12:09.140]  They finally broke with the corrupt top, the globalist top of the government. And then Trump was able to come in because the American people woke up, because the intelligence agencies woke up, because law enforcement woke up. I'm not lionizing law enforcement.
[1:12:09.140 --> 1:12:19.140]  But our police and military is a lot better than the Islamists and the globalists. And they don't want to kill America. They want prosperity. They're not out to get the country.
[1:12:19.140 --> 1:12:31.140]  Are they corrupt in some cases? You believe that this country's gotten corrupt, but they're not absolutely out to get everybody. And most of them aren't corrupt. The public is just decking and it doesn't care and doesn't know.
[1:12:31.140 --> 1:12:48.140]  And by the way, I'm in one of the biggest critics of law enforcement, one of the biggest critics of government until I did even more research and found out how that the left was attacking law enforcement to kind of bully them into a corner to fully get control of them with the strong cities initiative and this whole UN takeover.
[1:12:48.140 --> 1:13:01.140]  And once they do that, oh, then law enforcement, which historically becomes the main tool of tyranny in a Soviet or fascist system, it will be the enemy. But instead, strangely enough, we spoke out to them. We warned them.
[1:13:01.140 --> 1:13:12.140]  We pointed out what was happening and they're into evidence. They went and looked. They didn't call me a conspiracy terrorist. Just out of hand, ignore what I said. They went and looked and they found out it was true what Ron Paul said.
[1:13:12.140 --> 1:13:29.140]  And it was true what I said and it was true what Trump said and it was true what Barry Goldwater said and it was true what all the Patriots said and when the globalist demonized us, attacked us, tried to look, you make us look bad and evil and all this other crap because they knew we were telling the truth.
[1:13:29.140 --> 1:13:42.140]  That's why Hillary came out last Thursday and said Alex Jones, Info Wars, lost the election. He told all these lies, but she didn't list the lies I told because I didn't tell lies, lady. I talked about Jerry Epstein's plane and the pedophile rings all confirmed convicted.
[1:13:42.140 --> 1:13:58.140]  I talked about Wiener and the pedophilia and all of it. It's all come out now. I talked about the UN and the sex slavery and Haiti. It's all come out much later. Everything I said. I mean, I had that directly from the CIA, lady, directly from high level FBI and you know it and you can't stand it.
[1:13:58.140 --> 1:14:08.140]  That I'm crazy enough to get on air and say it when nobody else would. Oh, and here's the good news, sweetheart. Everybody else is saying it because I made it in vogue to go up against you and not care.
[1:14:08.140 --> 1:14:21.140]  Despite your threats and what you've done to me and my family and everything you know you've done. I'm not talking about on air. You can't stand it, do you? It didn't make me back down because I don't have a death wish. I don't want to be a martyr.
[1:14:21.140 --> 1:14:35.140]  But if I have to be, I'm ready. I already know where this leads for me, that God's been testing me, putting more and more weight on me, more and more attacks so that I can be an example when they tear me apart.
[1:14:35.140 --> 1:14:48.140]  When I am destroyed, my name is destroyed. I am drugged up, tortured, destroyed. I know that's in the cards. I know that's where this is going and I'm ready for all of it.
[1:14:48.140 --> 1:15:00.140]  You just, because here's the thing, I'm not a devil worshiper and I'm not a pedophile and I'm standing up for the children and it's not because I'm some perfect person, but I love God and I'll never serve you.
[1:15:00.140 --> 1:15:08.140]  And I'll never serve your dirt ball globalist, orthodox Islam. I'll never serve any of this because I serve God. Understand that?
[1:15:08.140 --> 1:15:18.140]  I've chosen what side I'm on and so understand, I already get it. I love how they threaten me and say it can get a lot worse as if I didn't know. I already know your plan.
[1:15:18.140 --> 1:15:28.140]  But here's the thing, you think you got your plan? God's got his plans. And the Lord works in mysterious ways and I have comfort and I know and I'll never blame God.
[1:15:28.140 --> 1:15:41.140]  If I'm hung up by my ankles, having my guts torn out by a bunch of globalists, okay? Or even in my family, whatever happens, I know it's in God's plan. I'm going to love Jesus Christ till the moment my soul is off this plane.
[1:15:41.140 --> 1:15:51.140]  Understand? I will love God and I will accept what God does no matter what happens ever. I will never. I already have seen the full deal.
[1:15:51.140 --> 1:16:00.140]  All I care about is being with God. That's it. And all I ask selfishly is that whatever happens to my children, that God lead their souls to Him.

[1:17:33.140 --> 1:17:40.140]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor. It works.
[1:17:40.140 --> 1:17:48.140]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level ballistic resistance certification from an authorized NIJ Ballistic Laboratory.

[1:18:30.140 --> 1:18:37.140]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[1:18:37.140 --> 1:18:44.140]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[1:18:44.140 --> 1:18:49.140]  Dropped by the site today, order a bag or two and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[1:19:19.140 --> 1:19:28.140]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference. I don't feel good. The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[1:19:28.140 --> 1:19:36.140]  Yeah, I've actually just run out of my superfemale. I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[1:19:36.140 --> 1:19:46.140]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good, and I know my hair is luxurious once again. So obviously a superfemale is amazing. I love it.
[1:19:46.140 --> 1:19:56.140]  Nascent iodine is essential. Survival Shield X2. If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest it's nascent iodine Survival Shield X2.
[1:19:56.140 --> 1:20:24.140]  It's got a five-star rating. It's a win-win InfowarsLife.com.
[1:20:24.140 --> 1:20:38.140]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he. Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:38.140 --> 1:20:48.140]  It is a fact. There's been a coordinated effort by the UN, the EU, Soros, the Democratic Party to bring in five-plus million Islamists.
[1:20:48.140 --> 1:20:58.140]  It is a fact that they are organizing and attacking. It is a fact those attacks are being used to call for the UN to start regulating all hate speech,
[1:20:58.140 --> 1:21:08.140]  which they call conservative or libertarian speech as well, to stop Islam. No, you stop shipping the people in and when they openly are on welfare and talk about attacking people,
[1:21:08.140 --> 1:21:21.140]  you deport their ass back to their Muslim heavens that they're trying to escape, but then convert us to. You know, if I ran from someplace, I would try to go become the natives.
[1:21:21.140 --> 1:21:29.140]  I would try to, you know, become the locals. I thought about moving part of the year to Hawaii because they don't have any allergies there.
[1:21:29.140 --> 1:21:38.140]  I like all the kind of jungle navigation and star navigation of the Aborigines or the Polynesians and the whole culture. I thought I'd kind of go native a little bit.
[1:21:38.140 --> 1:21:49.140]  You know, I just don't get like, if I'm leaving something, why do I go to something else than try to bring the crap that I just left to you?
[1:21:49.140 --> 1:21:53.140]  I'm ranting. I want to go to your phone calls.
[1:21:53.140 --> 1:22:00.140]  Coming up in the last segment, I have the answers to this. What is the scariest building you've ever seen?
[1:22:00.140 --> 1:22:06.140]  I'm going to break this down. I knew what it was as soon as I saw it, but this just ties into everything. So that's coming up.
[1:22:06.140 --> 1:22:18.140]  I'm going to answer Tom Hanks's question for him. But right now, let's go to your phone calls. Let's go to Judy and Julie and Josh and Mark and...
[1:22:18.140 --> 1:22:26.140]  Is that baddie? When others that are holding, let's go to Julie in New Jersey first. Julie, you're on the air from New Jersey. Go ahead.
[1:22:26.140 --> 1:22:32.140]  Hi, Alex. I love your show and I feel like I'm welcoming a friend into the house every time I turn you on. So thank you so much.
[1:22:32.140 --> 1:22:34.140]  Well, thanks for putting up with me, sweetheart.
[1:22:34.140 --> 1:22:40.140]  Oh, are you kidding? I mean, I think we're getting through life together because I just feel like we're getting shot from all directions.
[1:22:40.140 --> 1:22:51.140]  The reason I'm calling today, I wanted to ask you what's your take on... I'm from Chicago originally. So, you know, I'm thinking sister cities between London and Chicago.
[1:22:51.140 --> 1:23:04.140]  And you've got two liberal mayors that are just... It's like the daily dose of a pup rally. And, you know, they have these sugar-coated words to try and smooth it over and to make everybody feel like we should be...
[1:23:04.140 --> 1:23:14.140]  It's all come together. How about let's not bring people in from failed Islamic states where the women and children are all being enslaved and then all these men want to come over to our country?
[1:23:14.140 --> 1:23:22.140]  I mean, isn't that incriminating country where women are enslaved and there comes a boatload of only men? Hey, men, where are your women if they need help? Why didn't you save your women?
[1:23:22.140 --> 1:23:32.140]  You know the West. Or if it was Mexico or any other country, even though Mexico wasn't perfect, the U.S. wasn't perfect, if there was a bunch of Mexicans fleeing Mexico from a disaster,
[1:23:32.140 --> 1:23:41.140]  don't you think most of the boat would be women and children? For all the Mexicans' problems, I'd bet it'd be 80% women and children if it was an emergency boat from Mexico.
[1:23:41.140 --> 1:23:48.140]  Why are these boats from the Middle East almost all men? Because they don't see women as humans. Go ahead, I'm sorry.
[1:23:48.140 --> 1:23:52.140]  No, and Tony Blair, am I correct? Wasn't he the one that started bringing them in?
[1:23:52.140 --> 1:24:00.140]  Absolutely. In fact, it came out after he was out of office and he had secret deals with quotas with the EU to bring in Muslims.
[1:24:00.140 --> 1:24:08.140]  The quotas are public, where if you try to deny one of them, it's a hundred thousand dollar, a hundred thousand pound. That's like a hundred and fifty thousand.
[1:24:08.140 --> 1:24:12.140]  Fine, if you don't accept the Muslim.
[1:24:12.140 --> 1:24:16.140]  And May worked under him. Didn't she for Homeland Security?
[1:24:16.140 --> 1:24:17.140]  Yes.
[1:24:17.140 --> 1:24:25.140]  Okay, so I mean, where does it take them into this election? I mean, what are they going to do? I mean, there's no good option.
[1:24:25.140 --> 1:24:29.140]  The people running against her are even worse. Exactly.
[1:24:29.140 --> 1:24:37.140]  I know. And that's why, you know, you talk about these mayors. I mean, you know, what's the recourse? I mean, I'm really concerned about what's going on here.
[1:24:37.140 --> 1:24:45.140]  I mean, just seeing what was going on in New York City on Friday with the, you know, de Blasio, allowing the prayer session in front of Trump Tower.
[1:24:45.140 --> 1:24:48.140]  I mean, it's just out of control that they're allowed.
[1:24:48.140 --> 1:24:55.140]  I mean, de Blasio's got a known convicted terrorist that he's promoting, you know, at major public events. That's what I'm saying.
[1:24:55.140 --> 1:25:01.140]  The left is militaristic. They're hateful. They're allied with anybody that wants to take over.
[1:25:01.140 --> 1:25:07.140]  And here's the good news, though. 1776. We don't want to be violent, but our forebears knew about tyranny.
[1:25:07.140 --> 1:25:10.140]  They laid down that we're free men and women. We have a right to defend ourselves.
[1:25:10.140 --> 1:25:16.140]  So the Muslims aren't going to have their cakewalk here where they go into some Muslim country that doesn't have any weapons.
[1:25:16.140 --> 1:25:22.140]  And then Obama backs them with a billion dollars in weapons, you know, day one, over 40 billion total now to take down Syria.
[1:25:22.140 --> 1:25:28.140]  And then they can just murder people. You, the Muslims and the globalists are going to have to really fight us.
[1:25:28.140 --> 1:25:34.140]  And that's why they're so pissed because no matter what they do, we still got the Second Amendment.
[1:25:34.140 --> 1:25:43.140]  Yeah. My final point to you is this. And, you know, I was in Chicago visiting when the Westminster Bridge attack happened.
[1:25:43.140 --> 1:25:49.140]  And I was in my hotel and I looked out the window and it was right over the Chicago River where they have all the bridges.
[1:25:49.140 --> 1:25:57.140]  And, you know, I just think about the city and I just, you know, it's not a matter of if it's going to happen.
[1:25:57.140 --> 1:26:02.140]  You know, it just breaks my heart when it's going to happen. And, you know, God help us all really, Alex.
[1:26:02.140 --> 1:26:05.140]  I mean, it's just, we've got to stay strong.
[1:26:05.140 --> 1:26:10.140]  And I agree. And statistically, it's hundreds of thousands of Christians.
[1:26:10.140 --> 1:26:16.140]  It was more than that. It's like a million a year being killed. But to understand that's not, that's sad enough. That's bad enough.
[1:26:16.140 --> 1:26:22.140]  The bigger issue is the our elites are covering it up and promoting it and saying it's no big deal.
[1:26:22.140 --> 1:26:32.140]  But then some mentally ill scumbag white supremacist goes into a South Carolina church and kills poor, you know, nine poor black people for no reason.
[1:26:32.140 --> 1:26:38.140]  And then all white people are guilty. It's all over the news for six months. It's the Second Amendment's fault.
[1:26:38.140 --> 1:26:44.140]  They're blaming all these groups that didn't do anything. This guy wasn't even coordinated. It's very rare. It's horrible.
[1:26:44.140 --> 1:26:48.140]  But we all get blamed when we have nothing to do with it because it creates division.
[1:26:48.140 --> 1:26:54.140]  Then meanwhile, Islam is a billion, four hundred million people. And this is their main operating system.
[1:26:54.140 --> 1:27:00.140]  And they're coming for us. And our media then covers up for that. I mean, that is what's crazy.
[1:27:00.140 --> 1:27:05.140]  And I say, execute that guy that shot those nine black people. Cut his damn head off. I'll do it.
[1:27:05.140 --> 1:27:12.140]  The point is, is that why is there this love fest for Islam when it's the most anti-liberal crap ever?
[1:27:12.140 --> 1:27:15.140]  And I'll tell you why. The left is threatened by real liberalism.
[1:27:15.140 --> 1:27:21.140]  And I don't mean liberalism where you teach six-year-olds how to be crannies or, you know, how to have their sex change or whatever.
[1:27:21.140 --> 1:27:27.140]  I mean liberalism Thomas Jefferson of, let's live and let live open free society.
[1:27:27.140 --> 1:27:34.140]  That doesn't mean that you have to adopt the most radical crap. It means you can be conservative, you can be liberal, you can be libertarian,
[1:27:34.140 --> 1:27:39.140]  but you don't have to do anything and we're tolerant. The colleges are the opposite of tolerant.
[1:27:39.140 --> 1:27:45.140]  They are the most brainwashing, anti-free speech, crazy town, lunatic asylums the world's ever seen.
[1:27:45.140 --> 1:27:50.140]  And where does common sense come into it, you know? Listen, prayers for you.
[1:27:50.140 --> 1:27:56.140]  Common sense means you'll stand up and you have your own view and you can't be programmed like a cult member.
[1:27:56.140 --> 1:28:01.140]  So the elite are allied with Islam because it's a cult. They want to get you to accept a cult like Islam
[1:28:01.140 --> 1:28:08.140]  because if you'll accept a crazy, out of controlled cult, failed system like that that destroys any country it has control of,
[1:28:08.140 --> 1:28:14.140]  you'll then love globalism because it'll look great compared to it. I got to jump. Thank you so much.
[1:28:14.140 --> 1:28:16.140]  I just spent six to seven minutes with that lady. She was a good caller.
[1:28:16.140 --> 1:28:19.140]  I'm going to come back and I'm going to bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.
[1:28:19.140 --> 1:28:24.140]  I'm going to go to Judy and I'm going to go to Betty and I'm going to go to Alyssa and I'm going to go to John.
[1:28:24.140 --> 1:28:29.140]  I'm going to go to Josh and I'm going to go to Mercedes and I'm going to go to Mark and I'm going to go to everybody else
[1:28:29.140 --> 1:28:32.140]  on the other side of this break. I'm going to bam, bam, bam, so just be ready.
[1:28:32.140 --> 1:28:35.140]  I got to go to the next person no matter how great your points are.

[1:28:42.140 --> 1:28:47.140]  We are about to sell out of Super Metal Vitality. We're about to sell out of X2 again. I can't believe this is happening.
[1:28:47.140 --> 1:28:53.140]  We are about to sell out of a bunch of these items because they're organic. They're hard to source and I still discount them.

[1:32:08.140 --> 1:32:20.140]  The artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems. The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure Ground Breaking Water Filtration Systems

[1:32:38.140 --> 1:32:40.140]  The general public doesn't.
[1:32:40.140 --> 1:32:44.140]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[1:32:44.140 --> 1:32:48.140]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[1:32:48.140 --> 1:32:54.140]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.

[1:33:07.140 --> 1:33:28.140]  Let's go live right now. This is breaking right now.
[1:33:37.140 --> 1:33:41.140]  All right, folks, we got two segments to get to at least 10 of these calls.
[1:33:41.140 --> 1:33:45.140]  I'm going to go to everybody that's on the board right now, from Josh at the top right down to Batty.
[1:33:45.140 --> 1:33:48.140]  Judy's up next in Mercedes in just a minute.
[1:33:48.140 --> 1:33:50.140]  Go to these ladies' phone calls.
[1:33:50.140 --> 1:33:55.140]  But Mike Starnovich, M4Wars.com reporter, the next month and a half, he's starting his own syndicated show here.
[1:33:55.140 --> 1:33:57.140]  Weekdays.
[1:33:57.140 --> 1:33:59.140]  He just called me with huge news.
[1:33:59.140 --> 1:34:02.140]  He's been working on this all day.
[1:34:02.140 --> 1:34:06.140]  CNN has been caught staging a fake news scene.
[1:34:06.140 --> 1:34:07.140]  I want to be clear.
[1:34:07.140 --> 1:34:09.140]  I believe the Islamic attack is real.
[1:34:09.140 --> 1:34:10.140]  Radical Islam is real.
[1:34:10.140 --> 1:34:13.140]  But the globalists open the borders up and bring him in and letting him attack.
[1:34:13.140 --> 1:34:15.140]  That is a form of false flag.
[1:34:15.140 --> 1:34:17.140]  They don't control Islam, but they know what it's going to do.
[1:34:17.140 --> 1:34:21.140]  Like if I caught a rattlesnake and put it in your bed, did the rattlesnake take my orders?
[1:34:21.140 --> 1:34:22.140]  No, I was just waiting for you.
[1:34:22.140 --> 1:34:25.140]  You get in bed, sit on it, it's going to bite you on your butt.
[1:34:25.140 --> 1:34:28.140]  This is up on Starnovich's site, Medium.
[1:34:28.140 --> 1:34:30.140]  It's up on his Mike Starnovich Twitter.
[1:34:30.140 --> 1:34:31.140]  It's also up at Real Alex Jones.
[1:34:31.140 --> 1:34:34.140]  CNN caught staging fake news scene.
[1:34:34.140 --> 1:34:38.140]  So let's get on, whoever's on right now in Infowars, let's get this posted to Infowars.
[1:34:38.140 --> 1:34:39.140]  This is important.
[1:34:39.140 --> 1:34:40.140]  Then we'll go right to your calls.
[1:34:40.140 --> 1:34:43.140]  Starnovich will be on with us tomorrow to bring more of this down.
[1:34:43.140 --> 1:34:47.140]  Paul Watson will be on with us with the whole latest terror attacks.
[1:34:47.140 --> 1:34:55.140]  But CNN was caught staging another news video captured by citizen journalists who post the footage to his Twitter account.
[1:34:55.140 --> 1:35:02.140]  So Becky Anderson of CNN is seen in London handing out props to a, quote, peace group.
[1:35:02.140 --> 1:35:07.140]  They want to show groups that are saying peace to Islam, be good to Islam because that's not really there.
[1:35:07.140 --> 1:35:10.140]  They have to go out with a whole film crew and then produce it.
[1:35:10.140 --> 1:35:13.140]  And you can look at CNN and tell, like Hillary would have these town halls.
[1:35:13.140 --> 1:35:15.140]  I could tell we're shot in like HD.
[1:35:15.140 --> 1:35:21.140]  You could tell the cuts and everything were like perfect and that it wasn't a real broadcast came out later in WikiLeaks.
[1:35:21.140 --> 1:35:22.140]  It was fake.
[1:35:22.140 --> 1:35:24.140]  So Mike Starnovich, I know you're a busy man.
[1:35:24.140 --> 1:35:25.140]  We got callers too.
[1:35:25.140 --> 1:35:27.140]  So I promise I'm going to him, but this is big.
[1:35:27.140 --> 1:35:29.140]  We'll roll some of this footage over you.
[1:35:29.140 --> 1:35:32.140]  We've talked to the journalist that was able to capture this and get on video.
[1:35:32.140 --> 1:35:34.140]  It shows how dumb CNN thinks we are.
[1:35:34.140 --> 1:35:40.140]  They're on city streets shooting these fake events thinking we don't know what we're witnessing.
[1:35:40.140 --> 1:35:43.140]  CNN's famous for this back to the first Gulf War.
[1:35:43.140 --> 1:35:45.140]  Exactly.
[1:35:45.140 --> 1:35:52.140]  This was a citizen journalist, just another info warrior and it shows people the power of the phone.
[1:35:52.140 --> 1:35:55.140]  If you see the fake news media out there, record what they were doing.
[1:35:55.140 --> 1:36:01.140]  So the journalist who found this was his username is at M-A-R-K-A-N-T-R-O.
[1:36:01.140 --> 1:36:04.140]  He filmed it and I was just blown away by it.
[1:36:04.140 --> 1:36:06.140]  And right away I was like, this can't be real.
[1:36:06.140 --> 1:36:08.140]  They're caught dead in the act.
[1:36:08.140 --> 1:36:11.140]  This is a smoking gun video of CNN creating fake news.
[1:36:11.140 --> 1:36:18.140]  They even hand out, it looks like CNN printed out the flyers for the quote peace group to even hand out.
[1:36:18.140 --> 1:36:20.140]  This is faking every sense of the word.
[1:36:20.140 --> 1:36:23.140]  This is the biggest story of the day by far.
[1:36:23.140 --> 1:36:27.140]  This is amazing, but CNN again, I'm not saying all of Sandy Hook was fake.
[1:36:27.140 --> 1:36:29.140]  They misrepresent that.
[1:36:29.140 --> 1:36:32.140]  You can see Cooper turn and his nose is on a blue screen.
[1:36:32.140 --> 1:36:33.140]  It disappears.
[1:36:33.140 --> 1:36:35.140]  You can see the cars going in circles around it.
[1:36:35.140 --> 1:36:37.140]  They stayed, shoots there.
[1:36:37.140 --> 1:36:38.140]  CNN's famous for this.
[1:36:38.140 --> 1:36:41.140]  Then they flip around and say, oh, we're saying none of these events happened.
[1:36:41.140 --> 1:36:43.140]  No, we're saying the London Bridge attack happened.
[1:36:43.140 --> 1:36:45.140]  We're saying the Manchester attack happened.
[1:36:45.140 --> 1:36:59.140]  It's just they continue to get caught showing Muslims together, showing peace peace in these staged PR events with cops standing behind them to make it look like everybody's going along with the attacks and rolling over.
[1:36:59.140 --> 1:37:00.140]  Right.
[1:37:00.140 --> 1:37:08.140]  And what they wanted to do here was, it looks like they printed out props and they go, hey, just come here and we'll stage a scene.
[1:37:08.140 --> 1:37:09.140]  And that's the whole issue.
[1:37:09.140 --> 1:37:11.140]  CNN has some questions to answer.
[1:37:11.140 --> 1:37:13.140]  Now I know what they're probably going to say, Alex.
[1:37:13.140 --> 1:37:17.140]  They're going to say, oh, the protest, the peace group was already here.
[1:37:17.140 --> 1:37:19.140]  And all we did was we want a good shot.
[1:37:19.140 --> 1:37:21.140]  Now they have giant dollies, giant crews.
[1:37:21.140 --> 1:37:25.140]  It's all roped off like it's, it's, it's, they all want to be Netflix producers.
[1:37:25.140 --> 1:37:28.140]  So CNN's going pure fiction now.
[1:37:28.140 --> 1:37:29.140]  Right.
[1:37:29.140 --> 1:37:35.140]  I watched the video 10 times because the first time I saw it, I couldn't believe what I was seeing before me.
[1:37:35.140 --> 1:37:37.140]  I said, this, this has to be a Hollywood production.
[1:37:37.140 --> 1:37:44.140]  I thought it was a Hollywood production, then I fact checked it and I found out that CNN on his official Twitter page had posted it.
[1:37:44.140 --> 1:37:47.140]  And then I found out that this person was Becky Anderson and CNN.
[1:37:47.140 --> 1:37:48.140]  So this is real.
[1:37:48.140 --> 1:37:54.140]  The news now that people are watching are literally Hollywood productions of people, those people.
[1:37:54.140 --> 1:38:01.140]  And they have to go out and get women to dress up like Muslims to make it look like the Muslims are upset because they can't get the Muslims to come out and criticize it.
[1:38:01.140 --> 1:38:03.140]  So they get guys in turbines.
[1:38:03.140 --> 1:38:05.140]  You can tell all these people are actors.
[1:38:05.140 --> 1:38:09.140]  I mean, God, the, some of the beards are like glued on.
[1:38:09.140 --> 1:38:10.140]  Exactly right.
[1:38:10.140 --> 1:38:14.140]  And the, and the CNN people even printed out the little hashtags for the picture.
[1:38:14.140 --> 1:38:16.140]  You can see the CNN prop guy.
[1:38:16.140 --> 1:38:18.140]  No, you see them handing it out.
[1:38:18.140 --> 1:38:19.140]  You see them handing it out.
[1:38:19.140 --> 1:38:21.140]  Yeah, the props.
[1:38:21.140 --> 1:38:28.140]  Why does CNN think they can go in the middle of a street and do this over and over again and not get caught?
[1:38:28.140 --> 1:38:31.140]  Well, because they, that's why they tried to moralize people.
[1:38:31.140 --> 1:38:35.140]  And now they realize the CNN is ISIS contest happened yesterday.
[1:38:35.140 --> 1:38:42.140]  The infill word is every now, everywhere and now with the cameras and CNN is going to learn a valuable lesson today.
[1:38:42.140 --> 1:38:45.140]  I was just showing while you were talking, want to go back to it.
[1:38:45.140 --> 1:38:46.140]  They show the crew.
[1:38:46.140 --> 1:38:48.140]  It looks like a crew of like 70 people for this.
[1:38:48.140 --> 1:38:50.140]  This is a big Hollywood shoot.
[1:38:50.140 --> 1:38:53.140]  They've got lights in the middle of the day.
[1:38:53.140 --> 1:38:56.140]  I mean, this is highly produced.
[1:38:56.140 --> 1:38:57.140]  Yeah, they have lights.
[1:38:57.140 --> 1:38:59.140]  They have fake props.
[1:38:59.140 --> 1:39:04.140]  They have their little, you know, area roped off, even though there's no danger area.
[1:39:04.140 --> 1:39:05.140]  That is all fake.
[1:39:05.140 --> 1:39:06.140]  It isn't a real thing.
[1:39:06.140 --> 1:39:07.140]  And then they have these people.
[1:39:07.140 --> 1:39:08.140]  I mean, look at it.
[1:39:08.140 --> 1:39:13.140]  If you're watching the video, there's this caution tape, but the people are behind the caution tape.
[1:39:13.140 --> 1:39:18.140]  So how, how can you have a caution tape that's cordoned off?
[1:39:18.140 --> 1:39:21.140]  But then you have people behind the tape.
[1:39:21.140 --> 1:39:22.140]  So dangerous.
[1:39:22.140 --> 1:39:24.140]  The prop guys coming out the print things out.
[1:39:24.140 --> 1:39:29.140]  They're using the caution tape as the block for the production.
[1:39:29.140 --> 1:39:31.140]  This is unbelievable.
[1:39:31.140 --> 1:39:37.140]  It's like when the Queen of England goes to an African country, they arrest all the homeless people and they put up fake sets.
[1:39:37.140 --> 1:39:38.140]  Remember that?
[1:39:38.140 --> 1:39:40.140]  She got caught four or five times like 10 years ago.
[1:39:40.140 --> 1:39:45.140]  So she had to stop doing it like on fake sound sets, meeting the little African kids.
[1:39:45.140 --> 1:39:48.140]  If that crew Google, it's like BBC that admitted it.
[1:39:48.140 --> 1:39:52.140]  Queen of England caught meeting Africans at soundstage.
[1:39:52.140 --> 1:39:55.140]  Or fake village built for the Queen in Africa.
[1:39:55.140 --> 1:39:56.140]  That'll pull it up for you.
[1:39:56.140 --> 1:39:59.140]  Cernovich, this is just getting more and more insane.
[1:39:59.140 --> 1:40:00.140]  Yeah.
[1:40:00.140 --> 1:40:06.140]  And this really goes show, it shows why it's so necessary for everybody listening to realize how important it is.
[1:40:06.140 --> 1:40:09.140]  This footage didn't come from me or you or anybody.
[1:40:09.140 --> 1:40:14.140]  This came from an info warrior, a citizen journalist, somebody who's had enough and wants to fight back.
[1:40:14.140 --> 1:40:16.140]  Everybody listening has to fight back.
[1:40:16.140 --> 1:40:19.140]  Well, I'm going to, again, retweeted it real all it shows right now.
[1:40:19.140 --> 1:40:26.140]  This has to go totally mega viral, CNN caught red handed staging fake Muslim peace demonstration.
[1:40:26.140 --> 1:40:29.140]  Because they, you know, it's a big thing they can't get the Muslims ever come out and decry it.
[1:40:29.140 --> 1:40:33.140]  So they just staged this deal and this is just phony as a $3 bill.
[1:40:33.140 --> 1:40:35.140]  Mike Cernovich, thank you so much.
[1:40:35.140 --> 1:40:37.140]  Thank you, Alex.
[1:40:37.140 --> 1:40:39.140]  All right, let's get one call in here before the break.
[1:40:39.140 --> 1:40:40.140]  Judy in Florida.
[1:40:40.140 --> 1:40:42.140]  Judy, thanks for holding.
[1:40:42.140 --> 1:40:43.140]  You're on the air.
[1:40:43.140 --> 1:40:45.140]  Go ahead.
[1:40:45.140 --> 1:40:46.140]  Hey, Alex.
[1:40:46.140 --> 1:40:54.140]  It's really kind of terrible looking at that little boy they had situated up front in that shoot that you were just showing.
[1:40:54.140 --> 1:40:56.140]  I'm really getting cut.
[1:40:56.140 --> 1:41:03.140]  I'm tired of this level of mental illness and satanic activity, to be perfectly honest.
[1:41:03.140 --> 1:41:11.140]  I was calling today about Justin Trudeau and his statements after what happened on the London Bridge.
[1:41:11.140 --> 1:41:20.140]  That multiculturalism is the way we, you know, the future to quote counter hate by promoting the values of...
[1:41:20.140 --> 1:41:26.140]  Yeah, well, you can bring in Japanese or Nigerians that are Christians or Brazilians,
[1:41:26.140 --> 1:41:29.140]  because they just want to have a way of life and do business.
[1:41:29.140 --> 1:41:32.140]  But you can't bring in Islamists because they'll kill your ass.
[1:41:32.140 --> 1:41:37.140]  So no, multiculturalism is not the answer and bringing in Islam is not the answer.
[1:41:37.140 --> 1:41:38.140]  It's not compatible.
[1:41:38.140 --> 1:41:39.140]  It never has been.
[1:41:39.140 --> 1:41:43.140]  It is an exploitive, expanding cancer.
[1:41:43.140 --> 1:41:47.140]  Well, I think that we need to use the proper terminology.
[1:41:47.140 --> 1:41:51.140]  I mean, I've arrived at the fact that this is not terrorist attacks.
[1:41:51.140 --> 1:41:56.140]  I'm looking at it from, like, moving one generation forward and looking back.
[1:41:56.140 --> 1:41:57.140]  I mean, this is war.
[1:41:57.140 --> 1:41:58.140]  No, you're right.
[1:41:58.140 --> 1:41:59.140]  Exactly.
[1:41:59.140 --> 1:42:01.140]  And the police and military can't handle it.
[1:42:01.140 --> 1:42:02.140]  That's not what it is.
[1:42:02.140 --> 1:42:04.140]  We have to stop these people being here.
[1:42:04.140 --> 1:42:08.140]  And if you weren't born here and you haven't decried this and shown you don't agree with it,
[1:42:08.140 --> 1:42:11.140]  then deport them back to their hellhole.
[1:42:11.140 --> 1:42:17.140]  And they're keeping the men in these countries, including the UK, places in Europe and in Canada,
[1:42:17.140 --> 1:42:19.140]  and if they could, the United States.
[1:42:19.140 --> 1:42:22.140]  They're keeping the men standing down.
[1:42:22.140 --> 1:42:24.140]  I'm not saying to, you know, get violent.
[1:42:24.140 --> 1:42:25.140]  Not at all.
[1:42:25.140 --> 1:42:28.140]  No, but men have to get politically active and aggressive because they're bringing in
[1:42:28.140 --> 1:42:31.140]  their military-aged men knowing they don't have women.
[1:42:31.140 --> 1:42:32.140]  They're aggressive.
[1:42:32.140 --> 1:42:33.140]  They're meant to dominate and control us.
[1:42:33.140 --> 1:42:34.140]  Incredible points.
[1:42:34.140 --> 1:42:36.140]  Anything else shooting?
[1:42:36.140 --> 1:42:41.140]  Yeah, just basically that, I don't think Sadiq Khan has any place talking to a camera
[1:42:41.140 --> 1:42:42.140]  representing London.
[1:42:42.140 --> 1:42:46.140]  And I don't agree with it being a global city, no matter what he says.
[1:42:46.140 --> 1:42:48.140]  Judy, please call us more.
[1:42:48.140 --> 1:42:51.140]  These ladies are so smart, better spoken than I am.
[1:42:51.140 --> 1:42:52.140]  You can hear the conviction in their heart.
[1:42:52.140 --> 1:42:53.140]  They're sick of it.
[1:42:53.140 --> 1:42:57.140]  We're going to talk to Mercedes and many others on the other side and then get to Mark, Betty,
[1:42:57.140 --> 1:43:00.140]  Alyssa, John, Josh, and others.
[1:43:00.140 --> 1:43:06.140]  Remember when we used to say, if you think the Liberals hate Donald Trump now, just wait
[1:43:06.140 --> 1:43:09.140]  until he delivers on his campaign promises.
[1:43:09.140 --> 1:43:10.140]  Well, guess what?
[1:43:10.140 --> 1:43:11.140]  It's happening.
[1:43:11.140 --> 1:43:15.140]  And the Liberals are losing their freaking minds.
[1:43:15.140 --> 1:43:19.140]  What could be defined and construed as a dark speech?
[1:43:19.140 --> 1:43:23.140]  This will be the day that the United States resigned as the leader of the free world.
[1:43:23.140 --> 1:43:25.140]  I have such rage and sadness.
[1:43:25.140 --> 1:43:29.140]  We just watched a dangerous little man give a very, very scary speech.
[1:43:29.140 --> 1:43:32.140]  Michael Moore called it a crime against humanity.
[1:43:32.140 --> 1:43:38.140]  And Bette Midler tweeted that there has never in US history been such a destructive and
[1:43:38.140 --> 1:43:41.140]  megalomaniac in the White House as Donald Trump.
[1:43:41.140 --> 1:43:43.140]  Newsflash to Liberals.
[1:43:43.140 --> 1:43:49.140]  60 million plus Americans voted for Trump because of his campaign promises.
[1:43:49.140 --> 1:43:56.140]  And the president is delivering based on real science and done with an America first attitude.

[1:47:32.140 --> 1:47:36.140]  Bad luck when been blowing at my back.
[1:47:36.140 --> 1:47:43.140]  This is so incredible what's happening. I am in live time on real Alex Jones on Twitter and on Mike Cernovich's Twitter.
[1:47:43.140 --> 1:47:55.140]  I'm watching people tweeting at us going it's real. It's fake news. I can't believe it. You're showing CNN staging Muslims saying they're against the attacks.
[1:47:55.140 --> 1:48:05.140]  You have the behind the scenes video and then the people have now found the CNN edit from the film crew staging the event.
[1:48:05.140 --> 1:48:15.140]  You can only put it on screen for TV viewers. So they show you driving to it and then it cuts on CNN. Our message to terrorists get lost.
[1:48:15.140 --> 1:48:26.140]  And then it shows her showing one person there and then more while she's live like it's spontaneous. It shows on the video all these people getting in front of the camera and piling up.
[1:48:26.140 --> 1:48:36.140]  And that's it real Alex Jones right now. There's the lady opposing as a reporter and then we've got the footage of her where it's a huge film crew with a crew of like 70 people.
[1:48:36.140 --> 1:48:48.140]  Unbelievable man. That's devastating. And you watch the news tomorrow will say Alex Jones said that the London Bridge attack did not happen.
[1:48:48.140 --> 1:48:59.140]  I did not say that. I said they're putting out fake news to make it look like the Muslims are all criticizing it because they never do.
[1:48:59.140 --> 1:49:08.140]  Wow. Just like they say oh Jones says this didn't happen. That's how they deceive all day long because they can't face up to stuff like that.
[1:49:08.140 --> 1:49:12.140]  But I know you know and I know you're aware and I know you know what's happening.
[1:49:12.140 --> 1:49:22.140]  Now I'm going to go to Mercedes and others here in just a minute and other ladies that are calling like Alyssa and we go to the men that are calling.
[1:49:22.140 --> 1:49:27.140]  But right now who wants to disagree. I want to go to the head of the line.
[1:49:27.140 --> 1:49:35.140]  OK. Tom in London disagrees. He disagrees with me saying it's a false flag. I'm not saying Muslims aren't attacking. I'm not saying radicalism is a threat.
[1:49:35.140 --> 1:49:43.140]  The media always misrepresent. I'm saying the governments let him in. They let him go to Libya and train for three weeks and come back like the Manchester attacker.
[1:49:43.140 --> 1:49:53.140]  So the Muslims attacking is real but the Western governments are protecting it so they can regulate the Internet and take our rights. Where am I wrong Tom.
[1:49:53.140 --> 1:49:59.140]  Hi Alex. Yeah this is the thing that I disagree with you the most about. I disagree about a few things.
[1:49:59.140 --> 1:50:09.140]  By the way I don't think I've spoken to you since Trump was inaugurated. And it was almost two years ago now that I put a bet on the boatmakers that Trump would win.
[1:50:09.140 --> 1:50:17.140]  I remember your voice. I remember you calling about a year before he won saying that Trump was the man.
[1:50:17.140 --> 1:50:24.140]  Trump was the man but not not for the reason. No no not in a good way. You thought he was the guy to bring in the new world order. Go ahead.
[1:50:24.140 --> 1:50:32.140]  Yeah yeah yeah that's right. But I'm predicting now by the way I predicted four weeks ago that there would be a hung parliament in the UK.
[1:50:32.140 --> 1:50:43.140]  And one of the reasons for the Manchester attack actually was that the poll numbers were trending. Sure she was in she was within one number of losing one point of losing.
[1:50:43.140 --> 1:50:52.140]  Well she was trending to actually lose. I mean this is the important point because the Manchester attacks they said that it didn't help her but it did.
[1:50:52.140 --> 1:50:57.140]  I asked you this question two years ago and you didn't answer it. Are you a Muslim.
[1:50:57.140 --> 1:51:03.140]  I did answer it and I'm not. I remember you asked me. I remember you asked me and I'm not. But okay.
[1:51:03.140 --> 1:51:09.140]  My memory fails. That far back it's foggy. So I'm sorry if I accuse you of something you didn't say. Go ahead.
[1:51:09.140 --> 1:51:26.140]  Yeah so the Manchester attack caused the trending polls to plan. There was a zero. It was a minus bubble for three of them. It became a zero. That meant that she was no longer going to lose according to the trend of the poll.
[1:51:26.140 --> 1:51:35.140]  Now those polls then began to narrow a game. I'll admit it's suspicious that she was within one point of losing some polls showed losing.
[1:51:35.140 --> 1:51:45.140]  And then magically this happens but then explained to me the dialectic then they're bringing in millions of military age men they're attacking. She at least will criticize it.
[1:51:45.140 --> 1:51:53.140]  So she's bad staging it to stop Muslims when the other groups say bring in even more explain to me this.
[1:51:53.140 --> 1:52:03.140]  They don't have to bring people in. The the the Libyan was a second generation immigrant. He was recruited here. They he went back to Libya.
[1:52:03.140 --> 1:52:14.140]  Well it's admitted that Scotland Yard and in my five knew who he was and didn't do anything. So I got you there. So let me ask you that you agree it's a false flag. They're letting the Muslims attack.
[1:52:14.140 --> 1:52:28.140]  Yes. Yes. No no no. I don't I don't agree that they're letting people in. I think they recruiting people to do it's exactly the same as what happened in 77.
[1:52:28.140 --> 1:52:38.140]  But why do they stayed 77. I know she the swatter whatever was in my six. That's that was confirming by Fox News and the Justice Department and in my six.
[1:52:38.140 --> 1:52:46.140]  Why then stage terror attacks if you're bringing in record Muslims. What is the point.
[1:52:46.140 --> 1:52:56.140]  The people that they're bringing in aren't the ones committing the attacks. The ones committing the attacks are people who were usually born here and were.
[1:52:56.140 --> 1:53:03.140]  Right. Why is it usually second generation. Why is it usually second generation are doing the attacks at least in England and Europe. It's different.
[1:53:03.140 --> 1:53:14.140]  Because they're being recruited here for me from it's much easier to recruit people who are here and the networks you know the security services networks know who they are and they know how to.
[1:53:14.140 --> 1:53:18.140]  What is the reason for it.
[1:53:18.140 --> 1:53:32.140]  The reason for staging terror attack. They stage a terror attack. Well in this case it's for the reasons I've just said as well as of course increasing the security.
[1:53:32.140 --> 1:53:42.140]  I'm not giving to you may as calling for censoring everybody's Internet when when it's it's the government before her that brought all these Muslims in so either way you slice it it's being blamed on.
[1:53:42.140 --> 1:53:50.140]  Free peoples of Europe I don't care what color you are if you want freedom I love you your black guy your Hispanic Asian you want freedom I love you you don't go to hell.
[1:53:50.140 --> 1:53:57.140]  And all I know is I don't want to live in a Muslim country so don't bring in here but I hear your points I appreciate your call it's a conundrum.
[1:53:57.140 --> 1:54:03.140]  It's an enigma wrapped in a riddle.
[1:54:03.140 --> 1:54:15.140]  I don't know anymore. All I try to do is tell the truth and then I'll look at both sides. I guarantee tomorrow be Jones said it didn't happen or Jones said it did or you know Jones said it's a false flag.
[1:54:15.140 --> 1:54:22.140]  I'm here trying to have a real discussion. It's not sound bites and I'll be honest with you. You make some good points.
[1:54:22.140 --> 1:54:29.140]  Because the buck really stops here. I mean there's nobody telling me what to say. I'm really trying to find the truth here.
[1:54:29.140 --> 1:54:35.140]  All I know is all hell's breaking loose and the elite hate Trump and he's getting our economy going again.
[1:54:35.140 --> 1:54:43.140]  And my gut tells me he's good so I've learned in my life at 43 go with your gut my gut says Trump's good.
[1:54:43.140 --> 1:54:48.140]  And if he is so evil that my gut is wrong my guts never been wrong then he is the devil.
[1:54:48.140 --> 1:54:55.140]  I'll tell you that I mean I'll say that Trump is a new animal because my guts never wrong my gut tells me go with Trump.
[1:54:55.140 --> 1:55:00.140]  Mercedes in Oregon. Thanks for joining us today. Go ahead Mercedes.
[1:55:00.140 --> 1:55:11.140]  Hello Alex. I'm calling again. I was able to give Owen Scharer a testimony but it was really a great event.
[1:55:11.140 --> 1:55:23.140]  The reason I'm calling is to give you some truth from of course my point of view that you know we you know you had a guy on I think
[1:55:23.140 --> 1:55:32.140]  Gavin was calling for like patriarchy and oh patriarchy's back but I'd like to inform you a little bit about patriarchy
[1:55:32.140 --> 1:55:37.140]  being part of the cause of this mental disorder.
[1:55:37.140 --> 1:55:42.140]  I think Gavin McGill this is trying to be politically incorrect because there's such an attack on men in general.
[1:55:42.140 --> 1:55:49.140]  He's saying patriarchy to say I don't care about your attacks. Obviously we all came from women and men are an expression of women.
[1:55:49.140 --> 1:55:58.140]  So there's no such thing as patriarchy. There's one species but I mean I hear you Gavin McGinnis you know is just being controversial.
[1:55:58.140 --> 1:56:07.140]  But you're saying why are we laying down to this. OK so I want to explain that patriarchy has been paving the road for this and all forms of a.
[1:56:07.140 --> 1:56:15.140]  Ma'am there is no feminism. There is no patriarchy. We're all connected. We have daughters. We have sons. We have mothers.
[1:56:15.140 --> 1:56:23.140]  We have fathers. We're all together. In any division just like race is a lie.
[1:56:23.140 --> 1:56:28.140]  The only lie is these fake religions and political programs.
[1:56:28.140 --> 1:56:40.140]  I can also explain race too but so Islam and the Muslims are the old school patriarchy coming into this country where patriarchy has paved the road.
[1:56:40.140 --> 1:56:47.140]  You're wondering why this is happening. We have patriarchy light here compared to them. OK they're patriarchy old school.
[1:56:47.140 --> 1:56:52.140]  Ma'am I'm out of time. Call me back tomorrow and I promise I'll have you on more. Let's get her number if we can.
[1:56:52.140 --> 1:57:03.140]  I'll have her on like 10 minutes as a guest. When a male toucan flies off and steals some eggs or some fruit and puts it in his beak and flies back to the female.
[1:57:03.140 --> 1:57:17.140]  Is that patriarchy that he's in control of her in the nest? That's how he survives. The male goes out and he asks if he'll starve to death to feed the female to then vomit the food back to the babies.
[1:57:17.140 --> 1:57:30.140]  That's just life on this planet lady. Men go out and die in wars. Men go out and work. Men go into coal mines so women hopefully if you're in a level of success can sit back in the nest safe with the babies.
[1:57:30.140 --> 1:57:41.140]  That's where the life is is in the nest. The men are extensions of the human species as worker bees. The whole feminist thing is a giant lie. There is no patriarchy.
[1:57:41.140 --> 1:58:01.140]  There is no chauvinism. There is no feminism. There is humanity. I'm out of time. Sorry the other callers. Back tomorrow live 11am central info wars dot com. Spread those links.
