[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.840 --> 00:28.800]  welcome to the Alex Jones show on this Monday April 20th 2015 I'm David Knight
[00:28.800 --> 00:33.840]  I'll be your host today we have a lot of breaking news one of the things that's
[00:33.840 --> 00:36.720]  coming out it's gonna be coming out the next few days and Rand Paul has been
[00:36.720 --> 00:42.340]  leaking it it was at the top of the drudge report earlier and that is the
[00:42.340 --> 00:46.240]  Clinton cash question of course she's been going around trying to paint
[00:46.240 --> 00:52.320]  herself as one of all of us and she's essentially making herself a laughing
[00:52.320 --> 00:57.400]  stock it's absolutely absurd for her to talk about how she's one of us going to
[00:57.400 --> 01:02.600]  chipolty and of course that game was joined by Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio they
[01:02.600 --> 01:06.800]  played their own little chipolty games talking about how much more common they
[01:06.800 --> 01:11.380]  were than Hillary how they could relate to the common man even more so than
[01:11.380 --> 01:13.780]  Hillary but there's a new book that's coming out in a couple of weeks Rand
[01:13.780 --> 01:17.280]  Paul's been talking about it the New York Times got an early release of it
[01:17.280 --> 01:22.480]  drudge has a link to that article and they basically are going to break it
[01:22.480 --> 01:27.160]  down and it looks like there's evidence in their book and their research that's
[01:27.160 --> 01:32.040]  what they allege of pay for play we've always said that elections are an
[01:32.040 --> 01:36.040]  advanced auction of stolen goods that was H.L. Meakin quoted made that
[01:36.040 --> 01:39.960]  statement that's very true but it's also a way that you can get things to
[01:39.960 --> 01:45.120]  happen immediately when Hillary Clinton is Secretary of State and of course they
[01:45.120 --> 01:48.720]  go back all the way to Mr. Clinton's administration pointing out what's going
[01:48.720 --> 01:51.680]  on with that we're gonna break that down further in the broadcast and of course
[01:51.680 --> 01:54.680]  there's also an article up we'll talk about this in the next segment by one
[01:54.680 --> 02:00.200]  measure Hillary earned more than America's top 10 CEOs that's by her
[02:00.200 --> 02:04.680]  hourly compensation that's one of the ways that you can buy influence legally
[02:04.680 --> 02:10.160]  with politicians what do we do about Washington how do we pull this in are
[02:10.160 --> 02:14.960]  we going to make some rules that say you can't do that and then have the
[02:14.960 --> 02:19.560]  government police itself that's not gonna happen we see that all the time
[02:19.560 --> 02:23.600]  they don't police themselves on anything as a matter of fact the Congress just
[02:23.600 --> 02:28.000]  steps back and lets people have their own way they let the bureaucracy have
[02:28.000 --> 02:31.440]  their own way they let foreign governments and multinationals have their
[02:31.440 --> 02:36.440]  own way they basically have become passive it's almost like watching the
[02:36.440 --> 02:41.240]  results of the enabling act in 1933 with Adolf Hitler those from the Reich
[02:41.240 --> 02:45.440]  talk came in and said they signed a piece of paper that said we're going to
[02:45.440 --> 02:50.720]  let you Mr. Hitler write all the rules from here on out and that's essentially
[02:50.720 --> 02:56.320]  what our government has done they did it this last week on Wednesday the fast
[02:56.320 --> 03:01.240]  track of the fast track trade agreement for a trans-pacific partnership and
[03:01.240 --> 03:05.840]  transatlantic partnership they already had this being negotiated by in
[03:05.840 --> 03:10.760]  private in secret by corporate lobbyists and our own trade representative but of
[03:10.760 --> 03:14.840]  course the American people and their elected representatives can't see what's
[03:14.840 --> 03:18.280]  going on can't talk about what's going on there's a non-disclosure agreement on
[03:18.280 --> 03:22.680]  that so it was already on a fast track but what they did this last week on
[03:22.680 --> 03:28.400]  Wednesday was they fast-tracked the fast track agreement so you're going to see
[03:28.400 --> 03:33.080]  these things coming at us fast and furious and you know what this is
[03:33.080 --> 03:39.200]  essentially a major major step towards global governance by multinational
[03:39.200 --> 03:43.800]  corporations gonna break that down for you this is the actual implementation of
[03:43.800 --> 03:48.040]  the trilateral Commission strategy their whole reason for being their whole
[03:48.040 --> 03:52.680]  structure we're now seeing it as we have these regional trade blocks in North
[03:52.680 --> 03:57.120]  America as well as Europe being consolidated and we can see one of the
[03:57.120 --> 04:02.200]  results of that now going on in Greece we see that Greece is ordering raids on
[04:02.200 --> 04:06.720]  government coffers as cash dwindles this is something they're ordering a
[04:06.720 --> 04:12.520]  mandatory transfer of cash reserve data cash reserves from their state or owned
[04:12.520 --> 04:17.520]  enterprises to the central bank this is something that we saw happening in
[04:17.520 --> 04:22.440]  Venezuela didn't we in Venezuela Bloomberg was bragging about the fact
[04:22.440 --> 04:27.000]  that even though the people of Venezuela had no money for food water medicine
[04:27.000 --> 04:30.720]  they had to go to other countries to get it nevertheless the bankers who were
[04:30.720 --> 04:36.720]  loaning them money were making 700% return on investment we're seeing same
[04:36.720 --> 04:41.800]  thing happening now in Europe and what's the solution they say the solution is to
[04:41.800 --> 04:46.160]  go to a United States of Europe to give up sovereignty that's the only way that's
[04:46.160 --> 04:49.160]  going to be safe says Alan Greenspan and others stay with us we're going to break
[04:49.160 --> 04:53.280]  this down further for you we'll be right back
[04:59.160 --> 05:05.880]  there's no doubt that our country is in serious trouble right now and if you're
[05:05.880 --> 05:11.000]  wondering how on earth we ever got in this situation well I'll tell you how when
[05:11.000 --> 05:15.440]  the Democrats showed their true colors you got angry and you elected
[05:15.440 --> 05:20.120]  Republicans and then when the Republicans showed their true colors you got
[05:20.120 --> 05:25.000]  angry and elected Democrats and when anyone suggested to you that both
[05:25.000 --> 05:29.360]  parties were corrupt and that neither side were looking out for your best
[05:29.360 --> 05:35.520]  interest you acted like they were crazy but the real definition of crazy is
[05:35.520 --> 05:41.040]  doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results
[05:41.040 --> 05:46.800]  that's why it is vitally important that you wake up America and break the
[05:46.800 --> 05:53.760]  matrix info wars calm prison planet TV and the Alex Jones show because there's
[05:53.760 --> 05:57.400]  a war on for your mind
[05:57.880 --> 06:03.120]  hey brother this recently start using your products everything you said about

[06:32.880 --> 06:38.600]  harvested around the planet and then concentrated or maximum potency they
[06:38.600 --> 06:42.380]  want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for
[06:42.380 --> 06:45.880]  a while but then burn you out in my experience whereas stuff that gets your
[06:45.880 --> 06:50.120]  glands naturally going goes right to the source so it's pretty exciting and I

[07:00.720 --> 07:06.600]  air 20 years ago I weighed 180 pounds I lift weights five days a week I could
[07:06.600 --> 07:10.520]  swim two three miles then I discovered the New World Order the globalist their
[07:10.520 --> 07:14.880]  agenda I started an access television show I was so dedicated to my work and
[07:14.880 --> 07:19.840]  hanging around with radio guys that I began drinking I began smoking cigars
[07:19.840 --> 07:25.880]  and then even cigarettes I transformed from looking like a white Bruce Lee to
[07:25.880 --> 07:31.400]  looking like a job of the hut so I began a journey five years ago to shed the
[07:31.400 --> 07:37.160]  almost 100 pounds I started taking super male vitality and saw dramatic results

[08:09.840 --> 08:16.720]  waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones
[08:19.640 --> 08:23.080]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host today we're gonna
[08:23.080 --> 08:26.640]  be joined later in the show Leanne McAdoo and Jacarie Jackson both gonna come
[08:26.640 --> 08:30.400]  in and talk about some of the breaking stories on info wars.com of course we
[08:30.400 --> 08:35.400]  have a story right now at the top of info wars.com a video of a cop shooting a
[08:35.400 --> 08:39.760]  dog in a crowded area and people saying you almost shot me you know it's kind of
[08:39.760 --> 08:46.200]  the point where we're looking at this this dog the old saying is that when a
[08:46.200 --> 08:51.520]  dog bites a man it's not a news story but when a man bites a dog it is a news
[08:51.520 --> 08:56.360]  story because it's unusual I guess in that vein you know a cop shooting a
[08:56.360 --> 09:01.200]  dog or shooting a person is not really that much of a news story anymore when I
[09:01.200 --> 09:09.200]  went to CNN the top story at CNN today was this officer didn't shoot I guess
[09:09.200 --> 09:13.920]  that's the top story I guess that's a story when a cop actually doesn't shoot
[09:13.920 --> 09:18.200]  somebody and then the story says the officer shows great restraint and not
[09:18.200 --> 09:21.880]  shooting a charging suspect and this is a situation where probably he would have
[09:21.880 --> 09:27.360]  been justified to shoot somebody but it's gone to the point now where we don't
[09:27.360 --> 09:32.680]  have much control over the police they basically only have to say that they
[09:32.680 --> 09:35.880]  felt that they were in danger felt that they were threatened and then of course
[09:35.880 --> 09:41.200]  the system will give them carte blanche to use deadly force and that's something
[09:41.200 --> 09:46.080]  we really need to have a national debate about and that debate is beginning but
[09:46.080 --> 09:51.680]  unfortunately it gets sidetracked along this lines of racial profiling you know
[09:51.680 --> 09:57.360]  when you talk about what's going on and when you talk about the fact that we
[09:57.360 --> 10:00.760]  need to do something about this quite often people will pull in and say well
[10:00.760 --> 10:03.440]  there's there's a lot of crime in the black community there's a lot of
[10:03.440 --> 10:07.920]  illegitimacy in the black community and that really doesn't have anything to do
[10:07.920 --> 10:11.480]  with it you know that's a red herring that people bring in when we start
[10:11.480 --> 10:15.440]  talking about that we need to talk about what's going on with the police and
[10:15.440 --> 10:20.080]  of course they put more police officers it's called a broken window policy to
[10:20.080 --> 10:24.720]  put more police officers in poor areas if you have more police officers they
[10:24.720 --> 10:30.040]  are going to have more interactions with the people in the area and so there
[10:30.040 --> 10:34.520]  have to be strict rules about how they interact with people in other words if
[10:34.520 --> 10:37.520]  somebody is doing something maybe they were doing something dangerous but if
[10:37.520 --> 10:41.480]  they are now running away from you with their back to you with no weapon in
[10:41.480 --> 10:45.840]  their hand you shouldn't be allowed to shoot them in the back I know I took
[10:45.840 --> 10:50.240]  concealed carry class and I know that if I did that as an individual I would be
[10:50.240 --> 10:56.680]  rightfully charged with murder with unnecessary homicide so we shouldn't
[10:56.680 --> 10:59.440]  give that kind of a pass to people just because they work for the government at
[10:59.440 --> 11:03.800]  any level and we need to have this discussion because it is out of control
[11:03.800 --> 11:07.360]  and when we look at things like the illegitimacy rate in the black
[11:07.360 --> 11:12.480]  community we need to understand just as Walter Williams pointed out on Friday
[11:12.480 --> 11:18.280]  that where the black community was a few decades ago the white community is now
[11:18.280 --> 11:22.840]  so that is something that is a national problem and if we look at what's going
[11:22.840 --> 11:27.160]  on with police brutality we see that police brutality within the white
[11:27.160 --> 11:31.560]  community is probably now about where it was a few decades ago in the black
[11:31.560 --> 11:36.280]  community so it doesn't make me feel any better when I see that there's more
[11:36.280 --> 11:39.760]  black people that are getting shot than white people because I know that
[11:39.760 --> 11:43.080]  they're shooting white people I know that that's going to be something that
[11:43.080 --> 11:47.520]  continues to escalate unless we address the root cause of this unless we change
[11:47.520 --> 11:51.520]  the attitude of the government toward its citizens and unless we change the
[11:51.520 --> 11:54.400]  attitude of the citizens toward its government we need to understand that we
[11:54.400 --> 11:58.840]  don't go to government to make us safe for everything we need to understand
[11:58.840 --> 12:03.840]  that government itself can be a threat the founders of this country understood
[12:03.840 --> 12:07.880]  that that's why they put checks and balances in and now those checks and
[12:07.880 --> 12:13.080]  balances have been removed and we need to be very very cautious about that but
[12:13.080 --> 12:16.440]  something happened last week that I want to talk about and spend some time on and
[12:16.440 --> 12:22.800]  that is the Trans-Pacific Partnership the Trans-Atlantic Partnership TTIP we're
[12:22.800 --> 12:28.600]  now getting fast track of the fast track negotiating process and let me
[12:28.600 --> 12:33.680]  explain that to you the fast track process was essentially a process where
[12:33.680 --> 12:36.960]  they would have a trade representative from the White House from the
[12:36.960 --> 12:41.160]  administration go and negotiate with corporate lawyers hundreds of corporate
[12:41.160 --> 12:47.240]  lawyers secretly so that the public is not allowed to see our elected
[12:47.240 --> 12:52.280]  representatives are not consulted or participating in this but and then they
[12:52.280 --> 12:56.920]  can't even tell us if they go to look at it what's going on because they have to
[12:56.920 --> 13:01.320]  sign a non-disclosure agreement so the only information we get is from Wiki
[13:01.320 --> 13:04.960]  leaks thank you Wiki leaks for doing that
[13:04.960 --> 13:10.480]  nevertheless what they're doing is on on Wednesday they came together and they
[13:10.480 --> 13:16.320]  had Orrin Hatch and Ron Wyden and Paul Ryan come together on a compromise to
[13:16.320 --> 13:19.280]  fast track the fast track process they're going to make this secretive
[13:19.280 --> 13:24.520]  process go even faster and understand that at the top this is a bipartisan push
[13:24.520 --> 13:30.400]  just as it was when they ran NAFTA through 20 some odd years ago it was
[13:30.400 --> 13:33.920]  going to happen whether Bush or Clinton was elected the only person who was
[13:33.920 --> 13:37.640]  speaking out about it at the time was Ross Perot we don't have a Ross Perot
[13:37.640 --> 13:41.480]  talking out about this right now essentially everybody has signed on for
[13:41.480 --> 13:45.960]  this when you look at the Republicans who are running for president all of
[13:45.960 --> 13:50.320]  them signed on to fast tracking this all of them signed on to this secret
[13:50.320 --> 13:55.600]  process which is not only a devastating economic situation if we look at what's
[13:55.600 --> 14:00.080]  happened with NAFTA it's not only a horrible thing from us in the economic
[14:00.080 --> 14:06.360]  standpoint but it is also a sovereignty destroying treaty this is something that
[14:06.360 --> 14:10.120]  is part of the globalist plan that we've talked about for a very long time if
[14:10.120 --> 14:14.200]  you go back to the Clinton the Carter administration and you look at Zbigniew
[14:14.200 --> 14:18.400]  Brzezinski when he left there he founded the Tridelateral Commission that was
[14:18.400 --> 14:22.760]  North America Asia Europe bring those together what has happened now we see
[14:22.760 --> 14:27.320]  trading blocks between we see consolidation with NAFTA of North America we
[14:27.320 --> 14:31.280]  see consolidation in Europe with the EU all of these are being
[14:31.280 --> 14:36.920]  brought together and America is the central hinge for this for this next
[14:36.920 --> 14:41.720]  step to global governance by multinational corporations that is what
[14:41.720 --> 14:46.880]  this is let's recognize this for what it is I'm a libertarian I understand that
[14:46.880 --> 14:50.520]  we want to have free trade I understand that we want to have a free market but
[14:50.520 --> 14:54.640]  we need to understand that what we have in this country is not a free market we
[14:54.640 --> 14:59.200]  have crony capitalism and when we look at these free trade agreements these are
[14:59.200 --> 15:02.480]  not free trade agreements Ron Paul said a long time ago if you want to have a
[15:02.480 --> 15:05.320]  free trade agreement when they were talking about NAFTA you don't need a
[15:05.320 --> 15:12.080]  thousand page trade treaty you just have free trade you get rid of regulation
[15:12.080 --> 15:16.440]  you don't add more regulation so when you get a thousand page trade treaty
[15:16.440 --> 15:19.900]  which is being negotiated in secret which is going to be dumped on the
[15:19.900 --> 15:24.920]  Congress with no time for them to consider what is going on and it's
[15:24.920 --> 15:27.940]  going to not allow them to make any amendments it's going to be a straight
[15:27.940 --> 15:31.280]  up and down vote they're going to be pressured to do it right away they're
[15:31.280 --> 15:34.960]  going to be pressured by corporate lobbyists who wrote this when you look
[15:34.960 --> 15:39.440]  at that sort of situation you understand this is not free trade this is not free
[15:39.440 --> 15:44.680]  trade this is crony capitalism this is managed trade this is trade to benefit
[15:44.680 --> 15:50.600]  the large corporations and we need to understand that this is about sovereignty
[15:50.600 --> 15:56.920]  this is not just an economic issue this is this treaty unlike NAFTA is very
[15:56.920 --> 16:01.160]  explicit that it goes after things that affect our digital rights with copyright
[16:01.160 --> 16:06.000]  this is a way to put SISPA in in the backdoor this is a way to stop countries
[16:06.000 --> 16:12.000]  from controlling GMO if they're concerned about that or stopping Monsanto
[16:12.000 --> 16:15.720]  from putting glyphosate roundup into their country if they're concerned as
[16:15.720 --> 16:20.720]  they should be based on the research from the Lancet from the World Health
[16:20.720 --> 16:24.680]  Organization saying that they believe that glyphosate that roundup is a cause of
[16:24.680 --> 16:30.360]  cancer if people were to ban that then Monsanto would be able to go in and sue
[16:30.360 --> 16:36.360]  that government in a special court it's not even a real court it's a court that
[16:36.360 --> 16:40.860]  is set up where the corporations are on parity with the country and it's a
[16:40.860 --> 16:44.160]  process of arbitration we've already seen this happening with NAFTA
[16:44.160 --> 16:48.280]  quietly you don't hear about it because it's not in a public court and because
[16:48.280 --> 16:53.600]  the media is completely owned by these corporations that are suing and they
[16:53.600 --> 16:58.640]  have gotten massive judgments from these arbitration processes take a look at
[16:58.640 --> 17:01.520]  what's going on in Greece today this is a story that's on the drudge report
[17:01.520 --> 17:05.800]  Greece orders a raid on government coffers as their cash is dwindling the
[17:05.800 --> 17:09.040]  Greek government has ordered a mandatory transfer of cash reserves from
[17:09.040 --> 17:14.600]  state-owned enterprises to its central bank where else and a desperate bid
[17:14.600 --> 17:19.880]  together enough cash to remain solvent they say this cash crisis in Athens is
[17:19.880 --> 17:25.000]  degenerating with every passing day and they point out that this decree which
[17:25.000 --> 17:28.080]  would violate fiduciary obligations well what would that be that would be
[17:28.080 --> 17:32.760]  maybe the fiduciary obligations that they have made to their citizens don't
[17:32.760 --> 17:37.040]  worry because they're going to do the same thing that Venezuela did it was
[17:37.040 --> 17:41.680]  Bloomberg as I mentioned in the last segment Bloomberg that bragged about the
[17:41.680 --> 17:46.640]  fact that Venezuela was a great investment for bankers it was a 700
[17:46.640 --> 17:51.240]  percent return on investment that's great how could that happen when the
[17:51.240 --> 17:55.320]  people didn't have enough money Bloomberg said that they couldn't get
[17:55.320 --> 17:57.880]  water they couldn't get food they couldn't get medicine without going to
[17:57.880 --> 18:02.440]  neighboring countries ah but they recognize that their sovereign debts to
[18:02.440 --> 18:06.360]  the bank take precedent over what happens to their people and we see the
[18:06.360 --> 18:10.600]  same thing now happening in Greece and look at what the bank is doing to them
[18:10.600 --> 18:16.920]  the Greek government is having to pay 28 percent interest on their loans to
[18:16.920 --> 18:22.040]  these banks 28 percent interest credit card rates hey I remember when credit
[18:22.040 --> 18:26.720]  card rates were prohibited by law from being more than 10 percent that was
[18:26.720 --> 18:31.360]  before the runaway inflation of the Carter era and then they got rid of the
[18:31.360 --> 18:37.480]  usury laws and now we've got banks that operate openly as if they were loan
[18:37.480 --> 18:41.520]  sharks that was what we used to call it when you charge people more than 10
[18:41.520 --> 18:44.320]  percent when you charge people the kind of interest rates that they regularly
[18:44.320 --> 18:48.760]  charge people on credit cards today that was called loan sharking that was
[18:48.760 --> 18:53.800]  something that only the mafia did now all of the banks do that and they're
[18:53.800 --> 18:58.000]  doing it to countries now how did they respond to this how what's the response
[18:58.000 --> 19:01.560]  to this well a lot of people said that Greece is going to leave Alan Greenspan
[19:01.560 --> 19:06.640]  former Federal Reserve chairman said Greece is going to leave we also had
[19:06.640 --> 19:10.400]  the head of PIMCO the world's largest bond fund say that Greece is going to
[19:10.400 --> 19:18.040]  leave the EU they both said unless unless here's the qualifier unless we make
[19:18.040 --> 19:22.400]  EU something that it isn't right now unless the member states give up
[19:22.400 --> 19:28.480]  sovereignty and become as PIMCO's executive said the United States of
[19:28.480 --> 19:34.280]  Europe you see how these trade agreements these economic agreements
[19:34.280 --> 19:39.320]  metamorphosize into sovereignty agreements the banks have a wonderful way of
[19:39.320 --> 19:43.160]  doing that don't they and that's exactly what's going to be happening with the
[19:43.160 --> 19:46.520]  Trans-Pacific Partnership say with us right after the break we're going to
[19:46.520 --> 19:50.520]  have some clips of what some of the senators said about this last week is
[19:50.520 --> 19:54.080]  very enlightening we'll be right back

[24:59.920 --> 25:05.320]  go back to the trans-pacific partnership I wanted to it looks like we're losing
[25:05.320 --> 25:08.560]  when you look at this trans-pacific partnership thing is very depressing to
[25:08.560 --> 25:12.520]  see how their plan that they've had for decades is coming together how they have
[25:12.520 --> 25:17.440]  created these blocks that were essentially trading blocks they they sell it
[25:17.440 --> 25:22.760]  to the public as a free trade area then they turn it into a sovereignty area as
[25:22.760 --> 25:27.320]  they're trying to do in the EU as we saw 10 years ago the council on foreign
[25:27.320 --> 25:31.320]  relations had its principal recommendation for what should be done
[25:31.320 --> 25:35.360]  about NAFTA was that we should have a border around the entire perimeter that
[25:35.360 --> 25:41.120]  should be policed by Homeland Security and various American police agencies so
[25:41.120 --> 25:44.840]  they wanted to consolidate this into a kind of sovereignty area that would
[25:44.840 --> 25:49.280]  explain wouldn't it why we have this open border that neither political party
[25:49.280 --> 25:55.120]  will do anything to close this is Joe Biggs pointed out last week we see the
[25:55.120 --> 25:59.080]  drug cartels possibly terrorist organizations anything can come through
[25:59.080 --> 26:05.080]  those borders they're so porous and I don't want to erect some kind of fence
[26:05.080 --> 26:09.320]  that is so concentrated that it becomes essentially a prison for Americans
[26:09.320 --> 26:14.840]  either but we need to strike some kind of a happy medium there but it explains
[26:14.840 --> 26:19.040]  why we're not doing anything when you look at this council on foreign relations
[26:19.040 --> 26:24.440]  report 2005 and by the way one of the 31 members who was Ted Cruz's banker wife
[26:24.440 --> 26:28.960]  in that she was working I think at the time for JP Morgan she went on to work
[26:28.960 --> 26:34.320]  for Robert Zellick who was chairing that at Goldman Sachs he chaired that CFR
[26:34.320 --> 26:37.920]  report but that's what's going on in Europe right now they're saying that
[26:37.920 --> 26:40.640]  Greece is going to leave the only way they can keep it together is if they
[26:40.640 --> 26:44.200]  become a United States of Europe so it looks pretty dire it looks like we're
[26:44.200 --> 26:48.600]  going in one fell stroke here we're going to take these trading blocks in
[26:48.600 --> 26:52.440]  America is as I said before the linchpin in this we're going to be the
[26:52.440 --> 26:58.160]  connecting point between a European trading block and a Asian trading block
[26:58.160 --> 27:02.480]  but of course it ultimately is about sovereignty and people might start to
[27:02.480 --> 27:06.400]  understand that's what's going on when this is being negotiated in secret by
[27:06.400 --> 27:11.400]  corporate lobbyists who are giving the corporations the same power as government
[27:11.400 --> 27:15.880]  and who are protecting their interest to the extent that they can slam and shut
[27:15.880 --> 27:20.680]  down any laws in any country that go against what they perceive to be their
[27:20.680 --> 27:25.440]  interest but before I go back to this I just want to point out this article that
[27:25.440 --> 27:33.200]  came up today on the dredge report the Pew Center that does polls they say gun
[27:33.200 --> 27:36.920]  rights now for the first time top gun control and major public opinion shift
[27:36.920 --> 27:42.480]  in other words we can win this if we get behind this they say exactly two years
[27:42.480 --> 27:46.880]  after Obama's bid for gun control following the Sandy Hook shooting a new
[27:46.880 --> 27:51.280]  poll has discovered a huge shift in public opinion to backing second
[27:51.280 --> 27:54.360]  amendment rights and away from controlling gun ownership now let me tell
[27:54.360 --> 27:58.400]  you I had only been working at Info Wars a few months when the Sandy Hook
[27:58.400 --> 28:06.160]  shooting started and it was a full court all-out press for Alex Jones I mean he
[28:06.160 --> 28:11.800]  understood that the second amendment and our rights were hanging by a thread
[28:11.800 --> 28:16.720]  he pulled everything out he was doing extra broadcasts he was going for a
[28:16.720 --> 28:20.120]  couple hours afterwards talking to people doing everything he could that's
[28:20.120 --> 28:26.000]  when he went on with Piers Morgan it was very effective we have won that debate
[28:26.000 --> 28:30.520]  we have changed the understanding of the American people it's not propaganda
[28:30.520 --> 28:35.720]  it's simply explaining to them that you can't be safe if you turn over your
[28:35.720 --> 28:40.400]  safety to some people with guns in a uniform it doesn't work look at what
[28:40.400 --> 28:43.480]  happened in Kenya we've had two shootings now in Kenya one at a mall
[28:43.480 --> 28:48.620]  another at the University hundreds of people have died because the government
[28:48.620 --> 28:54.120]  wasn't there and nobody there had weapons to defend themselves no matter how
[28:54.120 --> 28:57.800]  long it takes of course they took seven hours in this latest case for the
[28:57.800 --> 29:01.360]  government to get the military out there but no matter how long they take
[29:01.360 --> 29:06.320]  there's always a response time 10 minutes 20 minutes an hour before
[29:06.320 --> 29:10.360]  they're going to get there and you never know exactly what they're going to do
[29:10.360 --> 29:12.960]  anyway when they get there we've seen this over and over again shooting the
[29:12.960 --> 29:17.560]  wrong person you cannot be safe if you turn your safety over to somebody else
[29:17.560 --> 29:23.120]  it's just like liberty liberty is never given it is always taken and you are
[29:23.120 --> 29:28.280]  going to have to take responsibility for your safety and people understand that
[29:28.280 --> 29:31.280]  for the first time they understand that and you look at these charts on this
[29:31.280 --> 29:36.520]  article you can see a massive reversal and I really appreciate what Alex Jones
[29:36.520 --> 29:40.920]  did two years ago he nailed it and he led that charge we'll be right back stay
[29:40.920 --> 29:43.200]  with us
[29:47.360 --> 29:56.960]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[29:58.200 --> 30:04.320]  let's talk about the real war on women first wave feminism was a noble cause
[30:04.320 --> 30:09.600]  but modern feminist well instead of fighting for say paid and protected
[30:09.600 --> 30:16.440]  maternity leave they want to ban words shirts and man-spreading come on that's
[30:16.440 --> 30:21.360]  cultural Marxism which asserts that culture and language is responsible for
[30:21.360 --> 30:26.680]  oppressing women and not the state the truth is the state encourages gender
[30:26.680 --> 30:30.640]  wars it's a divide and conquer tactic designed to keep us fighting amongst
[30:30.640 --> 30:35.520]  ourselves in fact the feminist movement was hijacked by the political class to
[30:35.520 --> 30:40.240]  exploit women as the late Aaron Russo revealed the Rockefellers bankrolled
[30:40.240 --> 30:44.560]  feminism and not because they had any interest in women's rights but because
[30:44.560 --> 30:49.240]  women in the workforce was the ultimate trifecta the state collects more tax
[30:49.240 --> 30:53.680]  dollars children are indoctrinated at an earlier age and the traditional family
[30:53.680 --> 31:02.240]  structure destroyed leon macadoo reporting for info wars calm and it's
[31:02.240 --> 31:06.880]  that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true
[31:06.880 --> 31:10.960]  nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children
[31:10.960 --> 31:15.360]  focus all of our children are hit with modern mind control television music
[31:15.360 --> 31:20.040]  fast food GMOs sugars you name it young humans have not yet developed their
[31:20.040 --> 31:24.680]  nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions it's no
[31:24.680 --> 31:28.280]  wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous
[31:28.280 --> 31:32.480]  psychotropic drugs working with my team we set out to find the best formula with
[31:32.480 --> 31:35.560]  the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take
[31:35.560 --> 31:39.080]  we worked with the leading manufacturer and nutritional supplements that are

[33:15.640 --> 33:19.720]  GCN radio network
[33:22.480 --> 33:27.000]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight on this April 20th 2015 I'm
[33:27.000 --> 33:30.560]  going to the studio with Jacari Jackson and we were just talking in the last
[33:30.560 --> 33:36.600]  segment Jacari about how the public's opinion their understanding of guns has
[33:36.600 --> 33:40.800]  completely reversed in the last couple of years it really looked like we were
[33:40.800 --> 33:45.600]  going to lose everything I think in the wake of Sandy Hook yes I think that was
[33:45.600 --> 33:50.200]  a tipping point as you were discussing earlier and Alex really did go all out I
[33:50.200 --> 33:54.520]  remember during that time you and I we were we do like a six-hour broadcast yeah
[33:54.520 --> 33:59.400]  from the day show to afternoon show and basically skipping commercial breaks the
[33:59.400 --> 34:04.560]  whole bit it was a very intense time but I think it was very necessary a very
[34:04.560 --> 34:09.840]  necessary thing to do because we see not only with Sandy Hook but after that they
[34:09.840 --> 34:13.960]  continue to go after these firearms you know they wanted to what they did sue
[34:13.960 --> 34:19.600]  Bushmaster what else happened they said the word come after the AK-47 the AK-47
[34:19.600 --> 34:24.480]  rounds and then you saw the guns gun sales explode Obama's gun salesman of
[34:24.480 --> 34:27.600]  the year we saw that recently again when they're talking about the two to three
[34:27.600 --> 34:31.440]  rounds so every time these things are exploited and they choose to come after
[34:31.440 --> 34:34.880]  the guns the gun sales go through the roofs and now people are getting the
[34:34.880 --> 34:39.560]  point they even if I'm more than likely will probably not be involved in a mass
[34:39.560 --> 34:42.800]  shooting I want to have a firearm to protect myself should somebody come and
[34:42.800 --> 34:45.400]  kick in my door three in the morning it doesn't have to be something super
[34:45.400 --> 34:48.320]  sensational you're walking through a parking lot somebody tries to shove you
[34:48.320 --> 34:51.880]  in a bad in a van yeah you pull out a firearm and shoot yeah absolutely well
[34:51.880 --> 34:55.200]  it part of it is just explaining the common-sense thing to people that look
[34:55.200 --> 35:00.760]  if you've got one person with a gun okay or in the case of this shooting in
[35:00.760 --> 35:07.120]  Kenya for example they had four guys they killed 150 people right had I forget
[35:07.120 --> 35:10.160]  how many hundreds they took was it 600 or something like that they took many
[35:10.160 --> 35:14.080]  people yeah I mean it was just incredibly crazy but you know when you've got
[35:14.080 --> 35:18.560]  only one person with a gun and everybody else's disarmed they're king you know and
[35:18.560 --> 35:21.760]  as long as they've got ammunition there you know they're in charge of it so
[35:21.760 --> 35:25.000]  people understand if you just point that out to them of course the difference is
[35:25.000 --> 35:28.800]  you never had the mainstream and they never will point that out the mainstream
[35:28.800 --> 35:32.360]  media never would point that out to people before and they never will but
[35:32.360 --> 35:36.720]  we can have that discussion such as the shooting I believe was in Oregon where
[35:36.720 --> 35:40.320]  somebody was running through and a man just pulled out his concealed carry he
[35:40.320 --> 35:43.800]  didn't even fire it he just pulled out his gun aimed at the guy and the guy so
[35:43.800 --> 35:46.680]  oh I give up and he ended up shooting himself but I guess you didn't want to
[35:46.680 --> 35:51.320]  take the chance of being taken alive but just simply introducing opposition
[35:51.320 --> 35:55.600]  firearm can completely change the dynamic and you notice David of all the
[35:55.600 --> 35:58.400]  mall shootings the school shootings that's the one that you rarely hear about
[35:58.400 --> 36:01.240]  because they don't want to talk about that the guy who pulled out a gun didn't
[36:01.240 --> 36:06.000]  even have to fire it he just scared the guy enough to end the massacre and I
[36:06.000 --> 36:09.200]  would go even farther jacari because I think it is a key part when we talk
[36:09.200 --> 36:12.680]  about having this discussion about police officers I think it's a key thing
[36:12.680 --> 36:18.720]  you and I both went down to the open carry rally in San Antonio there was a
[36:18.720 --> 36:21.800]  rally there because they had been harassing people who were legally open
[36:21.800 --> 36:25.880]  open carrying long rifles that's that's legal to do that if they give a little
[36:25.880 --> 36:29.760]  bit of background on that particular one there's several things that led up to
[36:29.760 --> 36:33.440]  that you know of course we are CJ Grisham who was walking with his son out
[36:33.440 --> 36:36.640]  in the woods you know he had a gun cop pulls up why do you have a gun like
[36:36.640 --> 36:40.200]  bald hogs out here you know make it run over you know eventually got arrested
[36:40.200 --> 36:44.000]  completely bogus chart and the thing you're talking about in San Antonio a
[36:44.000 --> 36:47.480]  couple gentlemen will sit sitting outside I believe it was a Starbucks or
[36:47.480 --> 36:51.680]  some type of similar restaurant open carrying their rifles which is 100%
[36:51.680 --> 36:55.320]  legal here in the state of Texas the officers decide to come over and harass
[36:55.320 --> 36:59.560]  the guys anyway that leads us up to the Alamo you know thousand plus people
[36:59.560 --> 37:03.680]  there lo and behold nobody got shot I mean yeah you believe that David it was
[37:03.680 --> 37:08.200]  very orderly and the interesting thing was that the police didn't harass
[37:08.200 --> 37:13.880]  anybody until it was over that was the key thing it was like the police just
[37:13.880 --> 37:16.840]  stayed back it took pictures of everybody they're watching us like a
[37:16.840 --> 37:20.200]  hawk and everything but they left everybody alone until pretty much
[37:20.200 --> 37:23.600]  everybody went and then you and I saw they there's a couple of guys left over
[37:23.600 --> 37:29.000]  and they went after them again and so the point being is that for the citizens
[37:29.000 --> 37:33.840]  to be armed is not to make the world more dangerous though it's citizens being
[37:33.840 --> 37:40.280]  armed is essentially a check to the police who are we see over and over again
[37:40.280 --> 37:44.440]  are using excessive force against the population who are harassing the
[37:44.440 --> 37:48.600]  population and just the fact that you have firearms there is one of the
[37:48.600 --> 37:53.920]  founders said it restrains evil the very presence of firearms restrains evil so
[37:53.920 --> 37:58.720]  it gets the cops to into a position where they're not in a bullying mode okay
[37:58.720 --> 38:02.360]  they basically respect the people and again we saw this at the Bundy ranch
[38:02.360 --> 38:06.160]  standoff right there was only a couple of individuals down there on the ground
[38:06.160 --> 38:10.680]  who had guns they had them holstered nobody was even aware of the one
[38:10.680 --> 38:13.640]  individual us the only thing they show the one individual up on the bridge
[38:13.640 --> 38:17.240]  that's right with the guns but they had guns trained on us and they were
[38:17.240 --> 38:21.280]  shouting that they were going to shoot us and yet the people just calmly walked
[38:21.280 --> 38:24.960]  up there but it was a deterrence to know that there were people there that had
[38:24.960 --> 38:28.760]  arms it was also to turn the media way that we need to make because people say
[38:28.760 --> 38:31.600]  well you guys are anti-police or anti cop we're not telling anybody to go out
[38:31.600 --> 38:34.520]  there and shoot no no we're just saying the simple fact that these people had
[38:34.520 --> 38:38.840]  firearms you know stopped the bullying procedures that they were going on
[38:38.840 --> 38:41.880]  previous they were tasing people throwing people to the ground and now
[38:41.880 --> 38:45.560]  they see somebody has a firearm okay maybe it isn't that serious have to run
[38:45.560 --> 38:48.520]  up and tackle this guy they started to think about it in a different way
[38:48.520 --> 38:54.360]  exactly exactly changes things all together and we've got a report up on
[38:54.360 --> 38:58.400]  info wars.com a video where a cop shoots a dog in a crowded area let's run a
[38:58.400 --> 39:03.080]  little bit of this report because this is what we have seen on virtually a
[39:03.080 --> 39:07.320]  daily basis there are so many of these things out there that it is getting hard
[39:07.320 --> 39:11.880]  to not become jaded about this right and it's not just this one particularly
[39:11.880 --> 39:15.840]  instant I believe Mikhail had a story last week about a police officer shooting a
[39:15.840 --> 39:24.240]  pig yeah you know it's going on a lot and it's one of those things that
[39:24.240 --> 39:28.440]  if you shot at a dog or something it'd be some big incident you know you probably
[39:28.440 --> 39:31.520]  get dragged into court and have to deal with all that kind of stuff but when
[39:31.520 --> 39:35.240]  officer does it in the thing about this is as the guys get ready to play this
[39:35.240 --> 39:40.840]  video the officer misses the dog at point blank range the bullet ricochets and
[39:40.840 --> 39:45.520]  luckily didn't hit anybody but you have to think had he ricocheted and hit a
[39:45.520 --> 39:48.800]  child and killed a child the dog owner would probably be on trial for manslaughter
[39:48.800 --> 39:52.200]  you know it'd be something absurd like that well actually there was a case
[39:52.200 --> 39:55.920]  similar to that there was a lady and husband who were having arguments and
[39:55.920 --> 39:58.960]  they put a restraining order on the lady which meant that she had to have a
[39:58.960 --> 40:04.960]  police officer escort her back to get her things moved out and as they were
[40:04.960 --> 40:08.360]  moving out they got into an argument again and the dog started barking and
[40:08.360 --> 40:12.920]  ran over and so the cop pulled out a gun to shoot the dog missed the dog and
[40:12.920 --> 40:17.960]  then lost his footing and as he was falling over he continued to shoot I
[40:17.960 --> 40:21.120]  mean where is the training on this and shot the lady in the chest and killed
[40:21.120 --> 40:25.240]  her yes so I mean yeah that that's not a hypothetical we've had situations in
[40:25.240 --> 40:28.160]  New York where they were chasing somebody and just started shooting wildly in the
[40:28.160 --> 40:32.960]  crowd I mean there has to be some training we can't have police when they
[40:32.960 --> 40:37.680]  shoot first mentality and a Barney Fife outlook the thing about this David you
[40:37.680 --> 40:41.120]  think about male carriers or other people pizza men who regularly encounter
[40:41.120 --> 40:44.760]  dogs often do they end up shooting the dog you know they're better trained
[40:44.760 --> 40:49.840]  long behold a male man with a can of pepper spray spray is a better equipped
[40:49.840 --> 40:52.680]  to deal with the dog than a police officer with a pistol yeah you know what
[40:52.680 --> 40:55.680]  happened to all this pepper spray they say they need it as a deterrent they
[40:55.680 --> 40:59.560]  need the tasers as a turn deterrent why do they have to pull out a gun and shoot
[40:59.560 --> 41:02.520]  especially in a crowded area as this let's run a little bit of this clip
[41:02.520 --> 41:07.600]  incident this is from Brooklyn New York it was a crowd of people gathered
[41:07.600 --> 41:11.360]  outside on Pacific Street watching the police activity and a lot of officers
[41:11.360 --> 41:15.720]  out there too you can see the dog get loose and at one point he jumps up on a
[41:15.720 --> 41:21.080]  lieutenant and then it happens one officer fires his gun at the dog from
[41:21.080 --> 41:27.160]  point-blank range but completely misses the crowd was incensed
[41:30.160 --> 41:35.400]  it didn't dawn on me it was a gun until if the shot actually went past my foot
[41:35.400 --> 41:39.440]  in it the spark hit the man behind me and then everything just really got
[41:39.440 --> 41:51.360]  crazy like yo you shot you're gonna open fire in a very crowded area their
[41:51.360 --> 41:55.200]  children out there yes I said earlier had that bullet struck somebody the dog
[41:55.200 --> 41:58.920]  over probably be on trial yeah having this dog run wild in the streets not
[41:58.920 --> 42:02.760]  the officer so what is the mindset of that officer when he pulls it out he's
[42:02.760 --> 42:05.560]  not thinking about the crowd he's not thinking about anybody else he's
[42:05.560 --> 42:10.560]  simply afraid and his first response is to use lethal force and the thing is
[42:10.560 --> 42:14.680]  that's the way they're being trained we saw that in New Mexico where they had a
[42:14.680 --> 42:17.440]  lot of issues that was where they famously shot the homeless man and
[42:17.440 --> 42:22.400]  that's right the mountains and at the State Police Academy a guy who was an
[42:22.400 --> 42:26.040]  experienced teacher there said we've got a new curriculum I think it's a shoot
[42:26.040 --> 42:29.280]  first curriculum and I refuse to teach it they wouldn't change the curriculum
[42:29.280 --> 42:33.800]  he resigned so there has been a tremendous change in the way the police
[42:33.800 --> 42:37.560]  are being trained and the way we see this but I think a key thing again going
[42:37.560 --> 42:40.600]  back to this Pew report looking at the actual data they say Americans now
[42:40.600 --> 42:45.600]  believe that having a gun is the best way to protect against crime 63% to
[42:45.600 --> 42:49.840]  30% that's more than two to one think that you're better off protecting
[42:49.840 --> 42:52.520]  yourself against crime they understand that the police can't be there we've
[42:52.520 --> 42:57.520]  had police who are honest to say that the police chief in Detroit yeah exactly
[42:57.520 --> 43:01.760]  says look I can't get there quickly enough we'll try to catch these guys
[43:01.760 --> 43:05.920]  we'll come as soon as we can but you need to be able to protect yourself as a
[43:05.920 --> 43:09.560]  high crime area he says you need to be able to protect yourself learn how to
[43:09.560 --> 43:13.920]  use it get a gun learn how to use it safely but understand that you have to
[43:13.920 --> 43:18.200]  take care of yourself also Sheriff Clark in Milwaukee he said that as well
[43:18.200 --> 43:21.480]  because the thing about it is is the police they come there they don't
[43:21.480 --> 43:24.320]  necessarily know what the situation is going to be so they get there it's two
[43:24.320 --> 43:27.280]  guys swinging baseball bats at each other one's a burglar one's the homeowner
[43:27.280 --> 43:31.240]  know who's doing what but you know if you have that equalizer being the firearm
[43:31.240 --> 43:34.000]  you may even if you don't have to shoot the guy you can get them down on the
[43:34.000 --> 43:37.000]  ground so you need to surrender before you know this escalates any further
[43:37.000 --> 43:42.240]  exactly now the public's change as reflected in this Pew poll is showing up
[43:42.240 --> 43:48.640]  in legislative issues now in Texas we've we've got a law that now bringing up to
[43:48.640 --> 43:53.440]  date on this jacari I think it has it passed or what level is it has okay we
[43:53.440 --> 43:57.800]  have yes the the open carry bill it's running through the House of
[43:57.800 --> 44:02.440]  Representatives and it was voted on Friday 96 to 35 to allow residents with
[44:02.440 --> 44:06.840]  concealed and gun licenses to openly carry their guns in public now this is
[44:06.840 --> 44:10.600]  not the constitutional carry that they really wanted but you know it's a step
[44:10.600 --> 44:14.680]  in that direction and this article also goes on to point out that you know
[44:14.680 --> 44:19.200]  despite Texas being a having a pro-gun reputation Texas is one of six states
[44:19.200 --> 44:23.320]  including California New York and Florida the currently banned citizens
[44:23.320 --> 44:28.120]  from openly carrying their handguns now to be very clear to people I guess a lot
[44:28.120 --> 44:31.480]  of people don't understand that here in Texas you can openly carry a long gun
[44:31.480 --> 44:36.280]  if you carry a rifle a shotgun slung over your hip or you or some other way we're
[44:36.280 --> 44:40.880]  not carrying in a manner calculated to cause alarm is the drug and they use so
[44:40.880 --> 44:44.680]  what they want to do the gun advocates and it looks like it's getting some
[44:44.680 --> 44:48.680]  steam behind it is to carry a pistol on their hip like a police officer does
[44:48.680 --> 44:52.920]  and a lot of people will make the debate well you know it's shocking it's this
[44:52.920 --> 44:55.880]  it's that well is it more shocking and see a guy walking down the street with a
[44:55.880 --> 44:59.520]  AK-47 strapped his back which is still legal and doesn't really bother me but
[44:59.520 --> 45:04.920]  I understand some people have a very strong part of it is a cultural thing
[45:04.920 --> 45:08.160]  part of it is getting people to understand that and of course we see
[45:08.160 --> 45:13.120]  that's happening now with the Pew poll there's also in North Carolina this is
[45:13.120 --> 45:16.960]  reported on New American today North Carolina takes aim at nullifying
[45:16.960 --> 45:20.720]  federal gun control regulations this would forbid enforcement of any federal
[45:20.720 --> 45:24.680]  regulation aimed at unconstitutionally abridging the right to keep and bear arms
[45:24.680 --> 45:28.880]  as protected by the Second Amendment I think this is in direct response to the
[45:28.880 --> 45:34.200]  ATF's recent and failed bid to try to ban certain calibers of ammunition once
[45:34.200 --> 45:38.440]  they can do it to one bullet they can do it to any bullet and talk about that ATF
[45:38.440 --> 45:42.200]  you know a lot of people say you know what happens you guys ever produce real
[45:42.200 --> 45:45.840]  change and while I don't personally take credit for things the ATF this most
[45:45.840 --> 45:49.320]  recent thing is a perfect example that people got informed about it you know
[45:49.320 --> 45:52.520]  whether it was from here or someplace else it took action they called and
[45:52.520 --> 45:55.720]  eventually backed off because enough people had the information and did
[45:55.720 --> 45:59.200]  something about it yeah that's how you get real change to happen in your
[45:59.200 --> 46:03.000]  country absolutely and the thing is that that's not something that is going to
[46:03.000 --> 46:07.200]  be coming out of CNN it's not something's gonna be coming out of an MSNBC and
[46:07.200 --> 46:10.600]  it typically won't even be something coming out of Fox News so yeah we're not
[46:10.600 --> 46:15.760]  the only alternative media out there the only authentic media we are still
[46:15.760 --> 46:19.520]  telling people what's going on with this and explaining to them what the
[46:19.520 --> 46:22.320]  consequences are to this and what it really ought to look like and I think
[46:22.320 --> 46:26.320]  we need to understand that it is really having an effect in this particular
[46:26.320 --> 46:32.320]  case they're pointing out that really the federal government doesn't have the
[46:32.320 --> 46:37.080]  the right under the Constitution to force the states to do anything and
[46:37.080 --> 46:41.160]  that's one of the things that North Carolina is responding to with this but
[46:41.160 --> 46:44.600]  of course we're seeing that in a variety of areas we're seeing that in bills that
[46:44.600 --> 46:49.880]  would deny utility services to the NSA because they understand that the NSA is
[46:49.880 --> 46:53.840]  coming in there and unconstitutionally doing dragnet searching and recording so
[46:53.840 --> 46:57.160]  so people are pushing back and in several states we've seen that
[46:57.160 --> 47:01.800]  legislation brought up to do that we also see and of course this is 420 we
[47:01.800 --> 47:06.440]  see a lot of that's the day that a lot of marijuana advocates yeah they were
[47:06.440 --> 47:12.440]  downtown yesterday but yeah we see that same sort of thing happening with the
[47:12.440 --> 47:16.280]  legalization of marijuana even for medical uses because we have to understand
[47:16.280 --> 47:20.840]  that the federal government has marijuana as a schedule one drug which says
[47:20.840 --> 47:24.560]  that it doesn't have any medical uses whatsoever which is clearly a lie
[47:24.560 --> 47:28.280]  everybody knows that's a lie that's a fraud being perpetrated on the American
[47:28.280 --> 47:31.920]  public and we all need to understand that where that law came from was the
[47:31.920 --> 47:36.560]  United Nations ten years before a war on drugs they came out with exactly the
[47:36.560 --> 47:40.240]  blueprint the agenda just like agenda 21 they came out with the entire
[47:40.240 --> 47:44.520]  legislative blueprint had four different schedules for you where you would put
[47:44.520 --> 47:48.320]  drugs and which where they wanted to put all of these different drugs and so
[47:48.320 --> 47:53.040]  that's why the UN is ringing its hands about legalized marijuana in
[47:53.040 --> 47:56.440]  different states I don't want to have something that you could use to
[47:56.440 --> 48:00.040]  potentially treat yourself growing in your backyard that's right it's hard for
[48:00.040 --> 48:03.640]  big pharma to get a cut out of that I'm not telling anybody go out and you'll
[48:03.640 --> 48:06.560]  just smoke to smoke but you know I definitely recognize the the medical
[48:06.560 --> 48:10.600]  benefits of having marijuana yes absolutely yeah I don't use it
[48:10.600 --> 48:15.520]  recreationally and I know you don't either jacari but I have always been
[48:15.520 --> 48:19.720]  upset for you know I should say since the war on drugs started since we saw
[48:19.720 --> 48:23.680]  things like mandatory minimums like we saw civil asset forfeiture that
[48:23.680 --> 48:28.520]  concerned me because I could see how they were using this to basically destroy
[48:28.520 --> 48:32.480]  our due process to destroy the rule of law to fill up the prisons we now have
[48:32.480 --> 48:36.240]  25% of the world's prison population is in America even though we don't have
[48:36.240 --> 48:39.360]  anywhere in many of them nonviolent offenders who are there under these
[48:39.360 --> 48:44.720]  mandatory minimums so I look at this and I say why am I having to be taxed to lock
[48:44.720 --> 48:49.200]  up nonviolent offenders for extraordinarily long periods of time
[48:49.200 --> 48:53.640]  destroying their lives destroying their family's lives why are we doing this it
[48:53.640 --> 48:57.240]  absolutely makes no sense and it's one of the things that I think we really need
[48:57.240 --> 49:01.920]  to to speak to the conservatives about because they're the ones who are
[49:01.920 --> 49:04.960]  dragging their feet who are active in opposition I think the the thing that
[49:04.960 --> 49:10.640]  that concerns me the most about it is seeing how the church believes that the
[49:10.640 --> 49:15.600]  only way they can stop people from abusing drugs and we need to understand
[49:15.600 --> 49:18.280]  there's a difference between use and abuse but the only way that we can stop
[49:18.280 --> 49:22.960]  people from abusing drugs is by using the force of the state and then
[49:22.960 --> 49:27.720]  completely hardening their heart to any testimony of anyone about how this drug
[49:27.720 --> 49:31.400]  is necessary in their life that's the thing that that really disturbs and
[49:31.400 --> 49:34.320]  people say well you get high off marijuana you get high off half the
[49:34.320 --> 49:38.040]  stuff in well not half stuff the majority of stuff you get the drug store you
[49:38.040 --> 49:40.800]  know you go to the pharmacist and they give you some you know OxyContin or
[49:40.800 --> 49:43.880]  whatever you can get high as a kite off of that as a matter of fact when they
[49:43.880 --> 49:49.040]  were talking about the heroin epidemic they were saying that there were far
[49:49.040 --> 49:53.560]  more deaths from prescription drug abuse than there were from heroin and
[49:53.560 --> 49:58.720]  OxyContin was one of the key things on it it's absolutely amazing to see how
[49:58.720 --> 50:02.440]  this is all playing out but people are starting to wake up and again going back
[50:02.440 --> 50:05.200]  to what's happening at the states I think that's really where we're going to
[50:05.200 --> 50:10.160]  see the changes where the states are asserting their legitimate sovereignty
[50:10.160 --> 50:15.400]  and saying we're not going to allow the federal government to come in and do the
[50:15.400 --> 50:19.000]  things that it's been doing before we're not going to just be a passive
[50:19.000 --> 50:23.600]  enabler of the federal government you see it whether it's a BLM or in the
[50:23.600 --> 50:27.840]  different land issues you see it on marijuana you see it on gun control
[50:27.840 --> 50:31.880]  we're seeing this across the board or even seeing it on civil asset forfeiture
[50:31.880 --> 50:35.560]  and that's a very important thing if the government can take your property
[50:35.560 --> 50:39.320]  without ever convicting you of a crime without even charging you of a crime
[50:39.320 --> 50:44.640]  that destroys all of our basic property rights that's exactly right and I'm
[50:44.640 --> 50:48.960]  glad you mentioned that because that's something that's very I don't say pop
[50:48.960 --> 50:51.280]  you hang on we're going to go to a commercial break we're going to be

[55:32.280 --> 55:35.480]  this video here this is a story like I said that just went up a drudge picked
[55:35.480 --> 55:39.440]  it up real quickly drudge has been really good about pointing out the
[55:39.440 --> 55:44.680]  invasions on our civil liberties for a very long time in terms of what was
[55:44.680 --> 55:48.920]  going on with the TSA pretty much everybody else was ignoring it Alex is
[55:48.920 --> 55:53.320]  reporting on this as the stuff was rolling out five years ago now we're
[55:53.320 --> 55:57.240]  seeing coming true what we were always saying that that they were using this
[55:57.240 --> 56:01.000]  they were abusing this that the machines had absolutely nothing to do with
[56:01.000 --> 56:05.680]  safety they were using the machines as well as their position to harass and
[56:05.680 --> 56:10.320]  sexually molest the American public we had a Texas representative here David
[56:10.320 --> 56:14.200]  Simpson who twice offered a bill to stop that because he said it is sexual
[56:14.200 --> 56:19.960]  abuse of children and adults what the TSA is doing came very close to a passing
[56:19.960 --> 56:24.560]  but of course the governor and the lieutenant governor got that shot down
[56:24.560 --> 56:28.960]  in the Senate and the federal government threatened to turn Texas into a no
[56:28.960 --> 56:33.680]  fly zone nevertheless my point being is that drudge has been very good in terms
[56:33.680 --> 56:38.320]  of pointing out these over-the-top actions that the federal government is
[56:38.320 --> 56:42.600]  doing and one of these is the increase in the military training that we're
[56:42.600 --> 56:47.400]  seeing throughout America and of course understand that the military has bases
[56:47.400 --> 56:52.080]  all over America they have large bases where they can do these drills inside of
[56:52.080 --> 56:55.680]  the base inside of the base that's why they're military bases and of course we
[56:55.680 --> 56:59.600]  have military bases in all these other countries to any places where they're
[56:59.600 --> 57:02.760]  fighting wars I mean there's not any shortage of places where they could
[57:02.760 --> 57:07.760]  train when they get out of the bases when they're getting into the streets as
[57:07.760 --> 57:11.920]  we see in this particular footage there's a different agenda going on here
[57:11.920 --> 57:16.920]  other than just training they're training the troops to do operations in
[57:16.920 --> 57:21.840]  continental USA and they're training the American public to get used to living in
[57:21.840 --> 57:26.960]  a banana Republic I remember traveling to other countries 20 30 years ago where
[57:26.960 --> 57:33.280]  I would see the police walking around in military gear with full assault weapons
[57:33.280 --> 57:40.200]  fully automatic weapons and that would strike you but of course it didn't make
[57:40.200 --> 57:42.560]  any difference to the people that were there they were accustomed they were
[57:42.560 --> 57:46.320]  used to about they were used to seeing that and so it's what you get used to
[57:46.320 --> 57:52.120]  seeing so they're accustomed us to living in a militarized police state a
[57:52.120 --> 57:55.680]  banana Republic with nuclear weapons let's take a look at this video right
[57:55.680 --> 57:59.320]  here this is an article up right now armed National Guard troops conduct
[57:59.320 --> 58:02.600]  exercise near a children's playground let's run a little bit this and we'll
[58:02.600 --> 58:11.520]  describe it for the radio audience okay this is in Stanton, Virginia and this
[58:11.520 --> 58:16.520]  individual is driving in the car pulling up you can see the troops there
[58:16.520 --> 58:20.080]  several troops yeah
[58:20.080 --> 58:34.960]  they're marching right at the edge of a it's like a park here even more troops
[58:34.960 --> 58:40.640]  that keep coming in now some have guns yeah all right we'll be right back thank

[58:48.120 --> 58:54.640]  hi I'm Alex Jones when I got on air 20 years ago I weighed 180 pounds I lift
[58:54.640 --> 58:59.200]  weights five days a week I could swim two three miles then I discovered the New
[58:59.200 --> 59:03.480]  World Order the globalist their agenda I started an access television show I was
[59:03.480 --> 59:07.520]  so dedicated to my work and hanging around with radio guys that I began
[59:07.520 --> 59:13.400]  drinking I began smoking cigars and then even cigarettes I transformed from
[59:13.400 --> 59:18.680]  looking like a white Bruce Lee to looking like a job of the hut so I began a
[59:18.680 --> 59:24.080]  journey five years ago to shed the almost 100 pounds I started taking

[01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:27.360]  Alex Jones welcome back to the Alex Jones show this Monday April 20th 2015 I'm
[01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:30.600]  David Knight your host today and joining me right now is Jakari Jackson and we
[01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:34.720]  were just looking at the footage this is a new article that went up on info
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:38.240]  wars life comm has been picked up by the dredge report armed National Guard
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:42.720]  troops conduct exercise near a children's playground there you go right
[01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:48.920]  next to a public park and we had a listener send this into us and we were
[01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:53.600]  just looking at this we could see the people walking next to the park fully
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:58.000]  armed a large number of very large routes yeah let's go back to that clip I
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:03.000]  wanted to see what was what was happening beyond that of course as we go
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.360]  that clip it was last week as Watson points out in the article that in
[01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:10.360]  Ontario California there were National Guard troops that were marching down a
[01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:15.560]  residential street while chanting military cadence and performing traffic
[01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:20.800]  control drills this is all an effort to get the troops accustomed to operating
[01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:25.680]  in America as well as getting the American citizens accustomed to living
[01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:30.080]  in a militarized police state make no doubt about it it was about a year ago
[01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:35.800]  that Joe Biggs and I went through AP Hill and again in that fort within that
[01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:41.280]  there was another area that had a separate area that was a walled in and
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:47.080]  fenced in to train troops to train police to act as military in American
[01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:51.600]  cities there was a replica of an American city American city there is
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:55.840]  signs in English there's a subway system we stood at the corner of first and
[01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:59.880]  main yeah okay and there were traffic lights that were operating as we were
[01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:06.640]  standing there and I mean it was like being in one of these end of the world
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:10.320]  movies you know where everybody has died and it's a vacant city it was pretty
[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:13.640]  pretty eerie and that's what they're training for they've been training for
[01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:20.120]  these scenarios in these separate areas within forts a double protected area for
[01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:23.880]  quite some time now they're moving out of the forts and they're training out
[01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:28.520]  into the actual cities where we've got let's let's go back to this video that
[01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:34.460]  we had and you can see these troops walking right down the edge of the
[01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:39.000]  playground with their arms people say that they're concerned about citizens
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:47.160]  having open carry we have to have real big for you'll be on his channel this

[01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:21.920]  info wars.com of course they'll have to look at that on their own computers
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:25.440]  because they wanted a lot of military bases they ban it the military the
[01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:29.440]  department and you know we look at these drills David you train in a terrain
[01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:33.520]  that you're planning to deploy to you're planning to be active to yes so when we
[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:37.240]  see these drills you know whether it's there whether we see the drills Miami
[01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:41.200]  Florida whether we see the drills in downtown San Diego California what cave
[01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:45.480]  in Afghanistan looks like Miami Florida yeah you know what do these guys try and
[01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:48.920]  that's the question that we keep asking that nobody really wants to answer well
[01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:52.560]  they're just training there was training for what what foreign desert looks
[01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:56.880]  like a San Diego California you know and as you see what in Florida this most
[01:03:56.880 --> 01:04:02.000]  recent one but just happened a couple of weeks ago they're going in to extract
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:07.200]  people who are enemies of the state okay they have civilians marching in lines
[01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:11.080]  they put them in white bands they drive them off that's what they've been saying
[01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:15.320]  that they're doing in their training scenarios and I have to say when they
[01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:20.600]  had massive exercises right at the border of Russia and you had a reporter
[01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:25.160]  talking to Putin and he says you know why do they have troops training here and
[01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:28.520]  goes well those aren't directed to you they're just a training exercise and he'd
[01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:34.040]  laughed at the guy for about 15 seconds it's absurd it is a laughable notion as
[01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:37.840]  you pointed out jacari they train as they're going to fight they train where
[01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:40.560]  they're gonna fight and means that they're gonna fight and that's what we
[01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:45.200]  can see it matches their scenario how many more times do we have to connect
[01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:48.560]  the dots for people I don't know thanks for joining us jacari thank you dad say
[01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:52.880]  what that's gonna be right back with some more breaking news
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:03.440]  I was born on the prairies where the wind blew free and there was nothing to
[01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:07.800]  break the light of the Sun I was born where there were no enclosures
[01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:12.360]  Geronimo I wonder what he thinks of the permanent checkpoints where you're

[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:31.560]  are we really more free when the Persian army demanded King Leonidas and his
[01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:36.200]  Spartans surrender their arms the outnumbered King shouted Molan Labe or
[01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:40.240]  come and take them even though Leonidas was eventually defeated by a much

[01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:14.760]  gcn radio network welcome back to the Alex Jones show on this Monday April 20th
[01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:19.560]  2015 I'm David Knight will be joined by Leanne McAdoo at the bottom of the hour
[01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:24.280]  I wanted to go back to the fast track and again as I pointed out in the last
[01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:30.960]  hour last week on Wednesday we had an agreement between Republicans and
[01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:37.640]  Democrats in the Senate and in the House to fast track fast track I know that
[01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:40.160]  sounds confusing but what they're going to do is they're going to take this
[01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:44.760]  fast-tracked authority which allows them to negotiate this in secret with
[01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:48.240]  corporate lobbyists as they've been doing now for several years they're
[01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:53.640]  about to run this up for a vote it's just going to be a mere formality
[01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:55.920]  because we know this is going to go through there's not going to be any
[01:08:55.920 --> 01:09:00.120]  opportunity for the public to take a look at this there will be no amendments
[01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:04.880]  allowed and this fast-tracked procedure it's going to be kind of a straight up
[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:07.400]  and down and of course this is something as I pointed out that is
[01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:13.720]  bipartisan NAFTA was run through by Clinton and by Bush and both of them
[01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:19.000]  would have passed that NAFTA and both parties the leadership of both parties
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:24.760]  are solidly behind this secret corporate trade agreement it's not good
[01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:28.520]  economic policy I don't believe it is not free trade by any means it is no
[01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:35.560]  more free trade than the corporate bailout of the banks was a free market
[01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:41.760]  exercise no it is crony capitalism it is rule by the very largest corporations
[01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:48.240]  on the planet it is a stepping stone to global governance by these multinational
[01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:51.840]  corporations and I want to play for you what Obama just said because it is
[01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:55.960]  essentially a fight that is going on within the Democrat Party the
[01:09:55.960 --> 01:10:00.840]  Republicans seem to be pretty much solidly behind it but the Democrats are
[01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:06.160]  still having a having a problem with this but here's what Obama said to
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:12.280]  assure people about this process it is entirely understandable that there is
[01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:19.800]  some skepticism around trade from working families who live in a town that saw
[01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:27.840]  manufacturing collapse and jobs being outsourced people recognize that there
[01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:32.120]  have been circumstances in the past in which trade may have contributed to
[01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:36.960]  aggregate growth of the global economy or even the US economy but hurt workers
[01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:41.480]  okay let's stop it right there that's essentially the position of many in the
[01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:46.080]  Democrat Party and understand that it is not just about a loss of jobs it's not
[01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:52.200]  just about a loss of high-paying jobs we've seen we were told by Clinton that
[01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:57.800]  we're going to get 200,000 new jobs in America after NAFTA passed within two
[01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:02.840]  years what we've seen on the other hand is 700,000 jobs lost 61% of those
[01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:07.800]  high-paying manufacturing jobs that have gone to other countries so it hasn't
[01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:11.680]  really worked out too well not on the income side not on the job side and not
[01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:16.200]  on the wealth side you need to understand that not only are we losing our
[01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:21.120]  income but we are losing our wealth we're losing what we had in this country
[01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:25.680]  we are going into debt at a rapid rate if you go back and you look at the trade
[01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:30.600]  deficits that we had immediately after NAFTA passed we had the largest trade
[01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:36.240]  deficit we'd ever had of 100 and it was over 130 billion dollars and we have
[01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:40.840]  never had a smaller trade deficit than that since it passed and the last 14
[01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:45.640]  years we have had 14 record years of trade deficit so it's been devastating
[01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:49.280]  economically it's devastated our jobs it's devastated our income it's
[01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:54.880]  devastated our wealth it's made us indebted to other countries predominantly
[01:11:54.880 --> 01:12:00.920]  though two banks but it also has a sovereignty issue side to it let's play
[01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:04.640]  this clip from Senator Brown who was one of the Democrats complaining about the
[01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:08.840]  fact that this is being done in secret and this was in the discussions leading
[01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:14.520]  up to passing the fast-tracking the whole fast-track process last week my
[01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:19.720]  question is this to the ambassador I can't speak for everyone else on this
[01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:24.560]  committee but from my own experience USTR's consultations with Congress
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:29.880]  have been I hesitate to use this adverb but I will pathetically inadequate that's
[01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:33.600]  the US trade representative we asked for data showing the utilization rate of the
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:38.680]  Korean FTA since it's gone into effect we've got nothing from USTR we asked
[01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:43.840]  for information used to justify the auto rules of origin proposal the US tabled
[01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:50.800]  in TPP USTR gave us nothing I might add that's where where you're able to say or
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:55.160]  maybe you aren't that you actually did renegotiate the North American free
[01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:59.560]  trade agreement we asked for analysis comparing the NAFTA auto rules of
[01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:04.880]  origin to the TPP auto rules of origin proposals USTR said they did not have it
[01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:09.960]  USTR did say they provide information from customs and academic studies that
[01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:13.600]  were used to develop the auto rules of origin okay so that's getting pretty
[01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:17.680]  technical let's just suffice to say do you get the idea that he's asking the
[01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:21.560]  USTR the US trade representative for information and the US trade representative
[01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:24.800]  is basically stonewalling him on in other words they're not getting any
[01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:28.640]  information now what passed last Wednesday they say it would give
[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:32.520]  Congress the power to vote on this deal and just the Trans-Pacific Partnership
[01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:37.040]  alone is going to have a it's 12 nations that are going to be involved in it
[01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:42.040]  it's about 40% of the world's trade so once it's completed it would deny
[01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:46.280]  lawmakers a chance to amend what would be the largest trade deal since NAFTA in
[01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:52.120]  1994 which Bill Clinton pushed through Congress despite opposition from labor
[01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:58.240]  and other Democrat constituencies see that's just it it wasn't that somehow
[01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:02.280]  this went wrong it wasn't that somehow this is going to be a good deal for us
[01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:05.680]  and create jobs they knew from the beginning that it wasn't going to do
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:12.760]  that they lied to us NAFTA did exactly what the bankers and the multinational
[01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:17.080]  corporations wanted it to do it provided them with cheap labor it exported
[01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:22.760]  manufacturing from our area just as Roth pro said that giant sucking sound we
[01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:26.080]  understand we need to understand that it did precisely what it was intended to
[01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:29.680]  do so many times we look at schools that are failing and we think oh you know
[01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:32.800]  it's just not working or the border is open I just don't why can't government
[01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:37.120]  get it right you have to understand the schools and the borders are doing
[01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:41.680]  exactly what they wanted them to do they just lied to you about the purpose
[01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:45.480]  they are doing precisely what they were designed to do and NAFTA did precisely
[01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:48.760]  what it was designed to do remember it was Petraeus it said just a few months
[01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:53.520]  ago what comes after North America North American Union North America comes
[01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:58.320]  after he says we're 20 years into it and we now have these consolidated
[01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:04.080]  economies and what comes after NAFTA what comes after EU is global corporate
[01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:07.680]  governance that's what we need to understand we need to see this as not
[01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:13.440]  simply a implementation being a failure of NAFTA economically we need to
[01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:19.520]  understand that it is coming after our sovereignty okay that is the key thing
[01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:22.800]  that we need to understand now there are people who are protesting it we got
[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:26.960]  worldwide protests there's a lot of people in Germany that they had a global
[01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:32.320]  day of action that's planned primarily in the Europe and in Europe and in the
[01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:37.640]  US I don't know that there's that many people in the US that are turning out to
[01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:42.520]  protest this though most people think that free trade is a good thing and free
[01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:46.040]  trade is a good thing this isn't free trade this is no more free trade than
[01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:50.600]  the Patriot Act is patriotic you understand when they give these names
[01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:56.720]  they give them the name of exactly the opposite of what they are because they
[01:15:56.720 --> 01:15:59.920]  understand that this is managed trade so they call it free trade they
[01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:04.480]  understand the Patriot Act was absolute tyranny that's why they gave it that
[01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:09.720]  acronym so there are thousands of people that are showing up in Germany and
[01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:15.800]  elsewhere but in America in America we seem to not really understand the real
[01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:20.240]  gist of this and again we need to understand this is about sovereignty as
[01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:25.280]  much as it is about creating an economic collapse this explains I believe not
[01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:29.280]  only why we have open borders but why we see the military training everywhere
[01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:32.480]  just as Jacarie Jackson and I were talking about in the last segment this
[01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:37.200]  article that's up on info wars calm drink linked at the dredge report about
[01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:43.480]  the exercise of National Guard right at the edge of a children's playground we
[01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:47.120]  had somebody send that into us and that that article is up there and as a as
[01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:51.760]  Watson points out in that article it was just last week that we had National
[01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:57.280]  Guard troops marching down a city street doing cadence why are we seeing all of
[01:16:57.280 --> 01:17:01.000]  these military drills why are they training for this in their scenarios
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:05.080]  why do they have bases within military bases where they trained to operate in
[01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:09.640]  cities they know that something is coming they know that we're going to
[01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:13.120]  have an economics collapse or we're going to have something else happen in
[01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:18.280]  this country very well could be an economic collapse brought on by these
[01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:23.240]  types of trade agreements look at how it has devastated our country after NAFTA
[01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:29.600]  imagine what's going to happen when we then make a more comprehensive trade
[01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:33.040]  agreement with China for example and of course the way they're selling it to us
[01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:37.920]  is by saying well right now China is writing all the rules and I think
[01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:41.680]  America needs to write the rules that's why we've got the Trans-Pacific
[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:45.720]  Partnership that's actually what the administration is saying in the first
[01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:50.520]  place why are we allowing China to write the rules and if we're allowing China to
[01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:53.920]  write the rules don't you think China might be writing the TPP along with the
[01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:57.960]  multinational corporations nothing is going to change on that we could assert
[01:17:57.960 --> 01:18:03.280]  our authority but of course we're not the American people aren't and Congress
[01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:07.800]  isn't when I look at what they're doing they're essentially turning over the
[01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:11.800]  governance already it's already a sovereignty issue already they're
[01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:15.640]  turning everything that they should be doing over to corporate lobbyists who are
[01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:19.280]  writing this in secret in the same way that they have turned over power to the
[01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:24.160]  bureaucracies you know when we look at this situation that is out in the gold
[01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:28.720]  mine in Oregon right now just as we saw the situation at the Bundy Ranch in
[01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:35.200]  Nevada we have bureaucracies like the BLM writing their own regulations finding
[01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:39.160]  you policing it and finding you guilty of those regulations in their own courts
[01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:43.320]  they have become their own little empires their own little governments and
[01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:47.440]  now we're allowing the corporations to do that and of course one of the reasons
[01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:52.760]  that the BLM is going in and confiscating property rights like grazing
[01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:57.960]  rights like mining rights that have been in private hands for 150 years going
[01:18:57.960 --> 01:19:02.120]  back into the mid-1800s the reason they're doing that is because they're
[01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:06.920]  going to turn that over to a corporation once they get enough of these people out
[01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:11.080]  it's the same thing we see at the local level all the time Alex talked about how
[01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:15.400]  he saw this here in Texas he got involved helping small property owners who
[01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:18.840]  were having the property confiscated because the city government was coming
[01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:23.360]  in and assessing huge fines on them so much so that they couldn't pay them so
[01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:26.640]  the city took their property once they took enough property from enough small
[01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:31.320]  poor homeowners they condemned the rest turned it over to their buddies who
[01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:36.200]  built skyscrapers I saw the same thing happening in Tampa where I grew up we
[01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:40.200]  called the mayor there Sandy Friedman Sandlot Friedman she was going in and
[01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:44.240]  pushing low-income people out of the homes that they had owned and then
[01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:48.480]  turning it over to large corporations that put skyscrapers on it that's what
[01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:52.320]  this is all about that's what the Keystone pipeline is about that's what
[01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:56.200]  this Trans Pacific partnership and transatlantic partnership is about and
[01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:59.040]  it's about a loss of sovereignty not just taking us down

[01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:10.200]  partnership and where this is all headed and of course as I mentioned in the
[01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:13.160]  first hour as well I think it's something that we should all that you
[01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:17.840]  should hear again is the fact that Greece is now going to go in and start
[01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:21.040]  taking money from all the different government departments to turn it over
[01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:27.040]  to paying the banks giving it to the central bank forget any obligations that
[01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:30.520]  they had made to their citizens they're going to turn it over to the bank
[01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:34.760]  understand that that's what's going to happen in America as well if we go off
[01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:39.200]  the petro dollar that's exactly what's going to happen here in America we've
[01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:42.640]  already seen it happen in Venezuela where the bankers bragged about their
[01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:47.800]  return on investment and the only way that you see people like Alan Greenspan
[01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:52.560]  the president of Pemco talking about how the only way they see that the EU is
[01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:56.760]  going to persist is if it becomes a United States of Europe in terms of
[01:25:56.760 --> 01:26:00.200]  turning its sovereignty over that's the way the bankers do it they've had these
[01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:03.480]  plans now for many many decades we pointed that out
[01:26:03.480 --> 01:26:09.120]  Bilderberg as well as the Trilateral Commission the Council on Foreign
[01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:13.240]  Relations they've all had this goal to create these trading blocks then use
[01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:16.760]  that economic leverage to get sovereignty over the states and then to
[01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:21.240]  combine that sovereignty into a world governance by multinational
[01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:24.520]  corporations so that's where this is all headed that's what you need to
[01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:27.960]  understand and you need to get active right now because this is going to be in
[01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:32.320]  just a very very short time they've already passed the fast track to get
[01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:35.800]  this thing before Congress where they're not going to be allowed to amend it
[01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:39.520]  whatsoever and they're not going to be allowed to see it we've had groups like
[01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:45.320]  EFF electronic frontiers foundation concerned about digital rights this is
[01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:49.800]  about a lot more than trade just within the agreement what we've seen leaked by
[01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:54.360]  WikiLeaks we know that this is about sovereignty this is a very dangerous
[01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:59.000]  thing we need to stop this and we can stop it if people speak out about it
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:02.080]  that's one of the things that we've seen this is we're talking about the change
[01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:05.400]  in the public's perspective and understanding about the Second Amendment
[01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:11.080]  you can get change if people will stand up and educate each other and then stand
[01:27:11.080 --> 01:27:15.120]  up and resist this we see it time and time again it can happen peacefully if we
[01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:19.200]  don't do it we're going to be devastated economically we may have a
[01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:22.920]  situation that precipitates martial law but either way we're going to be
[01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:26.440]  devastated economically and we will lose our sovereignty even more so we can
[01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:30.120]  reverse this however if people will wake up one of the things we need to wake up
[01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:35.680]  about is the fact that they're trying to ram down our throats this loss of
[01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:40.560]  informed consent saying they're going to take away our personal belief exemption
[01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:45.240]  that's the kind of language that they use to fool you no it isn't a personal
[01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:51.240]  belief it's my information my informed consent okay that's what it's all about
[01:27:51.240 --> 01:27:55.320]  and that has to be one of the cornerstones of anything in medicine
[01:27:55.320 --> 01:27:59.520]  look at this story that came out last Friday an infowars icon brain damage
[01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:03.480]  victims of swine flu vaccine when 63 million dollar lawsuit well looked at
[01:28:03.480 --> 01:28:07.520]  that I thought how did they get any money because we have a vaccine court you
[01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:11.920]  can't sue the vaccine companies and get any money remember that was something
[01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:15.440]  that was put in by Ronald Reagan back in the 1980s because there were so many
[01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:19.440]  lawsuits against the pharmaceutical companies because they were injuring so
[01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:23.400]  many people with their vaccines that they created a vaccine court so how do
[01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:28.280]  these people get 63 million dollars well this is because it's in the UK where
[01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:33.200]  they haven't done that people can still sue for damages so that's why they got
[01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:37.400]  that money they pointed out that since 2003 in the last 12 years just one
[01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:42.560]  pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline has paid out over nine billion dollars
[01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:46.440]  in injuries there you go but you're not going to get compensated in the United
[01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:51.800]  States instead you're going to be forced to buy a product from companies who
[01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:57.480]  have absolutely no liability doesn't that make you stop and think aren't you
[01:28:57.480 --> 01:29:02.480]  questioning what they are forcing on you and your family you should and you
[01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:06.360]  should be very concerned because it was just about a year and a half ago that
[01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:08.960]  they said they were going to stop all research on antibiotics they were going
[01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:14.240]  to focus exclusively on vaccines and they are and that makes perfectly good
[01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:18.640]  sense because if they injure people with antibiotics they have some liability in
[01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:23.640]  America if they do it with vaccines they don't we see that they're working with
[01:29:23.640 --> 01:29:30.080]  the government to create genetically engineered vaccines they're altering the
[01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:35.720]  DNA of these viruses and using that as the vaccine what could possibly go wrong
[01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:39.520]  stay with us we're going to be right back
[01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:56.200]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:11.560]  understanding those rights and fighting for them our country is falling apart
[01:30:11.560 --> 01:30:15.840]  because people have forgotten to fight to stand up in the face of tyranny and do

[01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:58.040]  joining me in the studio now is Leanne McAdoon Leanne the article that was up
[01:33:58.040 --> 01:34:04.440]  at the top of the drudge report earlier today was this new book about Hillary
[01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:10.040]  Clinton and Bill Clinton as well called Clinton cash she's been trying to appear
[01:34:10.040 --> 01:34:14.840]  to be one of the people she went to a Chipotle and got her picture taken at
[01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:19.240]  the Chipotle of course nobody recognized her so the staff went in there and got
[01:34:19.240 --> 01:34:23.440]  the security footage and showed it to the press but anyway so that's kind of
[01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:30.280]  sparked off this whole competition with Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush trying to be a
[01:34:30.280 --> 01:34:34.440]  more common man trying to relate to us through going to Chipotle and getting
[01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:38.320]  fast food I guess right but now this is pretty much going to be fatal to her I
[01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:43.080]  think I don't know it's hard to say I think people in the Democrat Party are
[01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:47.680]  really getting fed up with it because that's one thing they don't like to see
[01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:52.960]  is somebody that's really milking the system however she is a woman right so
[01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:56.760]  we should vote for her no matter how corrupt yes once again Hillary Clinton
[01:34:56.760 --> 01:35:01.160]  is the poor victim here it's not that she's been corrupt and you know giving
[01:35:01.160 --> 01:35:05.160]  out friends with benefits type thing here with through her state department
[01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:10.920]  with some of these foreign entities but she's basically saying that this book is
[01:35:10.920 --> 01:35:17.200]  just it's just more partisan politics and that it's all conspiracy theories and
[01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:21.400]  things like that but but the author of this book goes into really great detail
[01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:27.640]  and meticulously sources everything that he all the claims that he's bringing
[01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:30.760]  forth in this book so this isn't something that she can just brush off as
[01:35:30.760 --> 01:35:34.200]  a conspiracy theory now Rand Paul had talked about it said he thought it's
[01:35:34.200 --> 01:35:37.880]  gonna be pretty devastating of New York Times actually got a copy of it
[01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:42.440]  yesterday they wrote an article yesterday based on advanced copy that
[01:35:42.440 --> 01:35:45.400]  they got of it and they've got some eclipsant let's play the comment from
[01:35:45.400 --> 01:35:49.400]  Rand Paul though everybody is laughing at Hillary she's essentially becoming a
[01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:52.440]  caricature I mean you've even got starting night live taking hits at her
[01:35:52.440 --> 01:35:56.200]  that's that could be pretty devastating I remember when they did that to Gerald
[01:35:56.200 --> 01:36:02.600]  Ford playing up the idea that he was constantly falling over things or you
[01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:06.280]  know hitting hitting his head on things and they basically made a laughing
[01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:11.680]  stock of him Hillary on the other hand is somebody that is obviously very
[01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:17.160]  hungry for power she is courting this power from the most powerful of the
[01:36:17.160 --> 01:36:20.920]  financial community and that's not gonna set well with a lot of people in her
[01:36:20.920 --> 01:36:26.200]  party but this is what Rand Paul had to say I'm starting I'm starting to worry
[01:36:26.200 --> 01:36:30.080]  that when Hillary Clinton travels there's gonna need to be two planes one
[01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:43.720]  for herner entourage and one for her baggage I'm concerned that the plane
[01:36:43.720 --> 01:36:48.920]  with the baggage is really getting heavy and teetering and I'm concerned really
[01:36:48.920 --> 01:36:52.520]  that there probably will end up being a more of a primary than anybody thinks
[01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:57.440]  over there yeah I think basically he was using that baggage as a double entendre
[01:36:57.440 --> 01:37:02.200]  not just about her vast personal wealth which she said that you know she really
[01:37:02.200 --> 01:37:06.080]  struggled when they went to the White House they were dead broke just like us
[01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:11.600]  yeah exactly and on that note there was another article on the drudge report by
[01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:15.040]  one measure Hillary earned more than America's top 10 CEOs and that one
[01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:19.920]  measure was what does she make per hour well you know she makes about $300,000
[01:37:19.920 --> 01:37:24.640]  per hour you know she gets $300,000 for a one-hour speech and so they say well
[01:37:24.640 --> 01:37:29.880]  if you look at what the top 10 CEOs make and you break that down per hour you've
[01:37:29.880 --> 01:37:36.040]  got the number two guy making $63,000 an hour you've got the second best paid
[01:37:36.040 --> 01:37:42.320]  CEO on the Forbes list gets $32,000 the third one down gets $31,000 an hour
[01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:45.640]  that's pretty I think that's pretty excessive compensation I don't I don't
[01:37:45.640 --> 01:37:49.720]  know how anybody is worth that much in any corporation I mean that's just
[01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:56.800]  robbery but Hillary Clinton makes $300,000 per hour right okay going to
[01:37:56.800 --> 01:38:02.440]  college is to champion how students need to to not be saddled there with debt
[01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:07.080]  their schooling and it's going to pay for people like her to come speak for
[01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:10.840]  exactly the funds of these of these whether having to pay is gonna go to a
[01:38:10.840 --> 01:38:14.440]  Hillary Clinton yeah lectures them on on turning over all their money right
[01:38:14.440 --> 01:38:20.440]  interesting yeah the Clinton's income was at least $136.5 million
[01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:26.040]  from 2001 to 2012 according to this book so yeah dead broke yeah we'll see the
[01:38:26.040 --> 01:38:30.400]  thing is is that we're getting we're getting these elections where it's
[01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:33.760]  going like two billion dollars you know for the for the candidates to go
[01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:38.840]  through there they buy a lot of media the media is for sale mm-hmm and we
[01:38:38.840 --> 01:38:43.120]  should really question though what they're getting for this as I mentioned
[01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:46.760]  before H.L. Minkin said an election is an advanced auction of stolen goods
[01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:51.240]  she's getting a lot of money from foreign corporations and of course he
[01:38:51.240 --> 01:38:54.520]  points out that those foreign corporations when they gave money to the
[01:38:54.520 --> 01:38:57.920]  Clinton Foundation they got favorable treatment at the State Department so the
[01:38:57.920 --> 01:39:02.520]  guy who wrote this book Clint Cash the untold story of how and why foreign
[01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:07.080]  governments and businesses helped to make Bill and Hillary rich mm-hmm that
[01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:11.600]  could be really devastating to her right and and again it's not that there's
[01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:15.080]  this dynasty and that Americans just want to vote for this dynasty they
[01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:19.960]  continue to choose the Bushes and the Clintons because they their track record
[01:39:19.960 --> 01:39:25.040]  is proven they they will consistently vote for the policies that are going to
[01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:29.440]  you know put more money in the pockets of their rich wealthy friends and
[01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:33.280]  corporations so that's the business businesses they don't take risks when
[01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:37.320]  they're betting so the Clintons and the Bushes are you know it's a huge return
[01:39:37.320 --> 01:39:40.360]  on investment right if you go back and you look at the money that corporations
[01:39:40.360 --> 01:39:43.200]  give to these politicians and then the kind of contracts that they get in
[01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:47.160]  return they can't do any better investment and that's essentially the
[01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:51.640]  problem you're never going to be able to stop this by legislation you're going
[01:39:51.640 --> 01:39:55.880]  to have to remove the power and the money out of Washington right because
[01:39:55.880 --> 01:40:00.800]  otherwise it is this black hole for power for corruption and no matter it
[01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:05.920]  creates this gravitational force that is going to pull the corruption in no
[01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:10.160]  matter what you do so you're going to have to take away that consolidated
[01:40:10.160 --> 01:40:13.280]  mass there one of the things they pointed out the New York Times article was
[01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:18.960]  that in 2010 there was a million dollars I'm sorry they said there was a million
[01:40:18.960 --> 01:40:22.720]  dollars in this book they point out in payments to Clinton by Canadian Bank and
[01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:26.920]  a major shareholder in the Keystone pipeline right now one of the things
[01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:31.440]  that we see and I mentioned earlier Clinton was a huge backer of NAFTA he
[01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:34.120]  sold it to everybody as something that was going to create jobs instead of
[01:40:34.120 --> 01:40:38.720]  eviscerated jobs especially manufacturing jobs in this country but we see
[01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:44.440]  that Keystone pipeline for example they have given the Canadian company that is
[01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:48.560]  running this thing they have given them the rights of imminent domain where they
[01:40:48.560 --> 01:40:54.720]  can condemn land in America to take land from farmers that have had it in
[01:40:54.720 --> 01:40:59.640]  their and their family for over a hundred years and giving that condemnation
[01:40:59.640 --> 01:41:04.280]  power to a foreign corporation that's what NAFTA looks like that's what TPP
[01:41:04.280 --> 01:41:08.520]  looks like and the way they get it is by buying influence with people like
[01:41:08.520 --> 01:41:12.280]  the Clintons like the Bushes and we understand that this is not just a
[01:41:12.280 --> 01:41:17.200]  Hillary problem there's another article here Jeb Bush funneled two billion
[01:41:17.200 --> 01:41:21.080]  dollars and Florida pension funds to his brothers pioneer donors these are
[01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:24.900]  people who donated so much money that they got pioneer status they were
[01:41:24.900 --> 01:41:28.080]  bundlers okay they would bundle this money together and I don't really
[01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:31.800]  understand the nuances of the election law I don't understand how what they did
[01:41:31.800 --> 01:41:36.000]  as a bundler is different from what Dinesh D'Souza did exactly he went to
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:40.560]  jail okay he was just naively trying to participate in the process these guys
[01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:44.360]  though they go through they understand the laws because they wrote them so he's
[01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:49.360]  got 11 firms that received Florida new Florida pension investments under Jeb
[01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:54.200]  Bush that were all pioneer backers of his brother when he ran for president so
[01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:58.640]  it happens with both of with both parties and especially with these two
[01:41:58.640 --> 01:42:02.880]  royal families right absolutely and here you know we see these big donors
[01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:06.680]  once if their guy gets into the presidency they'll end up getting these
[01:42:06.680 --> 01:42:10.680]  cushy jobs maybe they'll be the ambassador to some small country or
[01:42:10.680 --> 01:42:14.880]  something like that so of course when you have foreign donors they're expecting
[01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:20.400]  a little bit of kickback as well and a lot of the the countries ran Paul is
[01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:24.080]  pointing out if there's really a war on women well why don't you return some of
[01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:28.080]  the money from Saudi Arabia the United Arab Emirates or Brunei where people
[01:42:28.080 --> 01:42:34.200]  there are being murdered for being gay you know or for or beheadings there's
[01:42:34.200 --> 01:42:37.960]  there's a real war on women for women yeah there's a real war on it's not a
[01:42:37.960 --> 01:42:41.760]  metaphorical war on women there is a real war on women in Saudi Arabia of
[01:42:41.760 --> 01:42:45.920]  course there are close allies yeah oh yeah they're the worst of the worst when
[01:42:45.920 --> 01:42:50.720]  it comes to human rights ranking they're again and again the worst of the worst
[01:42:50.720 --> 01:42:54.760]  and so that's what it is we'll give you millions of dollars I think it was like
[01:42:54.760 --> 01:43:02.040]  7.3 million from Saudi Arabia from 1999 until 2014 so millions of dollars
[01:43:02.040 --> 01:43:04.840]  funneling in and it's almost like we're gonna give you all this money so that
[01:43:04.840 --> 01:43:10.040]  you'll look away from what we're doing to the people of our own country and you
[01:43:10.040 --> 01:43:14.600]  know because typically we would be putting economic sanctions against these
[01:43:14.600 --> 01:43:19.040]  countries with these atrocious human rights records but not Saudi Arabia not
[01:43:19.040 --> 01:43:23.320]  the United Arab Emirates not Brunei no absolutely not yeah it's amazing it'll
[01:43:23.320 --> 01:43:26.480]  be interesting to look at this in greater detail as I pointed out this is
[01:43:26.480 --> 01:43:30.560]  an article New York Times you'll find that linked on the drudge report the
[01:43:30.560 --> 01:43:34.160]  book is Clinton cash the untold story of how and why foreign governments and
[01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:37.360]  businesses helped to make Bill and Hillary rich yeah they they were rich
[01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:42.280]  they were not just scraping by she went out with me when they came out but I
[01:43:42.280 --> 01:43:46.200]  thought it was also interesting that this phony position that she's got going
[01:43:46.200 --> 01:43:50.160]  at the same time all this is the reality of Hillary Clinton the persona that
[01:43:50.160 --> 01:43:53.600]  she's trying to project is she's going across the country in this silly little
[01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:59.880]  van episode and she goes into a Chipotle and she has her picture taken and then
[01:43:59.880 --> 01:44:05.680]  if that wasn't bad enough Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio have to join in and the gang
[01:44:05.680 --> 01:44:12.040]  okay and they have to go in to Chipotle and say I do tip because she got
[01:44:12.040 --> 01:44:15.200]  criticized for not tipping okay the guys said oh yeah I remember her yeah they
[01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:19.280]  didn't leave any money and everything so Marco Rubio goes in and says no I I
[01:44:19.280 --> 01:44:24.760]  always tip and then he had to walk that back because when he when he talked to
[01:44:24.760 --> 01:44:27.760]  the guy that was with him his staff he says oh well no we didn't but we
[01:44:27.760 --> 01:44:31.680]  typically always do that kind of stuff and then Jeb Bush says well I drive to
[01:44:31.680 --> 01:44:36.600]  Chipotle myself because Hillary Clinton says that she hasn't driven since 1996
[01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:40.200]  okay yeah so yes I'm not an elitist being a member of the Bush family I
[01:44:40.200 --> 01:44:43.800]  drive to Chipotle myself I pick the stuff up and I drive it home and I eat it
[01:44:43.800 --> 01:44:49.000]  okay the reality is that George HW Bush I remember when the guy was campaigning
[01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:54.200]  for president and he went to a grocery store and he was absolutely stunned by
[01:44:54.200 --> 01:44:58.720]  the barcode reader he'd never seen one he'd never been in a grocery store or a
[01:44:58.720 --> 01:45:02.760]  any place to go shopping these guys don't drive themselves they don't shop for
[01:45:02.760 --> 01:45:06.040]  themselves they don't go into any of these restaurants or whatever except when
[01:45:06.040 --> 01:45:09.760]  they're campaigning it is the most phony thing you can imagine it's like when
[01:45:09.760 --> 01:45:14.280]  Gwyneth Paltrow just tried to be so noble and she said I'm gonna try and live
[01:45:14.280 --> 01:45:18.160]  live off like what people on welfare do I'm gonna go to the grocery store with
[01:45:18.160 --> 01:45:22.880]  just $29 and she bought all of this organic that clearly shows how out of
[01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:26.120]  touch she is with the average person who is shopping on welfare I think she
[01:45:26.120 --> 01:45:30.200]  lasted about two days with all of her limes and greens and everything somebody
[01:45:30.200 --> 01:45:34.280]  is shopping on welfare with a $29 a week budget they're gonna be buying stuff
[01:45:34.280 --> 01:45:38.800]  like ramen noodles to be buying milk and vegetables and that's one of the
[01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:41.760]  reasons why we've got the obesity issues that we've got in here but they're
[01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:46.000]  gonna have to buy the ultra cheapest food and that's going to be loaded with
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:51.520]  all kinds of toxic preservatives and fillers and it's basically so I like
[01:45:51.520 --> 01:45:56.160]  green but it comes in a variety of different colors yeah flavors well and
[01:45:56.160 --> 01:45:59.120]  you know I gotta give it to Rand Paul because you know that's one thing that
[01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:03.440]  I do appreciate about him is that he rather rather than following what's
[01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:07.160]  what the reporters are choosing to speak about which is Hillary Clinton at
[01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:10.960]  Chipotle so rather than jumping on that little bandwagon he's been getting out
[01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:15.600]  ahead of them and spinning spinning the the normal narrative around where it's
[01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:19.240]  usually only Republicans and things are gonna be asked about their stance on
[01:46:19.240 --> 01:46:23.040]  abortion and he got right out there and made this huge thing about well why
[01:46:23.040 --> 01:46:27.200]  don't you ask the Democratic Party about if they think life starts or if they
[01:46:27.200 --> 01:46:30.840]  think it's okay to to kill a seven-pound baby and that's the key thing
[01:46:30.840 --> 01:46:35.480]  talking about a seven-pound baby not talking about the term not talking
[01:46:35.480 --> 01:46:39.320]  about some kind of abstract thing about well philosophically when does life
[01:46:39.320 --> 01:46:45.080]  begin I remember when I ran for Congress as a Libertarian Party candidate and it
[01:46:45.080 --> 01:46:48.920]  was really kind of a just a paper candidacy but I participated in some
[01:46:48.920 --> 01:46:52.920]  debates and I remember people asking you about that and I had never really
[01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:56.520]  thought about abortion I never had to think about it personally and I remember
[01:46:56.520 --> 01:46:59.680]  when I looked up partial birth abortion was the issue at that point time and I
[01:46:59.680 --> 01:47:04.640]  said okay I realized at that point that it was no long I realized that it wasn't
[01:47:04.640 --> 01:47:09.760]  about a dispute as to when life began they were willing to kill full-term
[01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:13.520]  babies and that was the key with what Rand Paul said right when he said would
[01:47:13.520 --> 01:47:18.480]  you kill a seven-pound baby yeah people can relate to that he said nobody went
[01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:22.280]  out and asked no no no no the no journalists went and asked Hillary
[01:47:22.280 --> 01:47:26.400]  Clinton how she felt about late-term abortions while she was out talking
[01:47:26.400 --> 01:47:31.680]  about her daughter about to give birth yeah I mean if that was a Republican you
[01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:35.120]  know if the tables were turned it would be a completely different opportunity for
[01:47:35.120 --> 01:47:39.240]  them to say well you know the late-term abortions I mean this could be Chelsea
[01:47:39.240 --> 01:47:43.440]  and nobody went there with with Clinton so once again we're probably gonna see
[01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:48.080]  no one going there with Clinton on these these donations yeah we got that clip
[01:47:48.080 --> 01:47:51.040]  let's let's play that clip
[01:47:51.040 --> 01:48:10.720]  Center the DNC is picking up in your comments you may with AP this morning on abortion I just want to know where you should stay on exemptions should there be any exemptions for abortion or not? What's the DNC said? You know I guess to use the question you know we always seem to have the debate way over here on what are the exact
[01:48:10.720 --> 01:48:35.720]  decals of exemptions or when it starts? Why don't we ask the DNC is it okay to kill a seven-pound baby in the uterus? You go back and you ask Debbie Wasserman Schultz if she's okay with killing a seven-pound baby that is just not yet born yet. Ask her when life begins and you ask Debbie when she's willing to protect life. Will you get an answer from Debbie? Come back to me. Thank you.
[01:48:35.720 --> 01:48:53.720]  And they did that and they did that and when they talked to her she said she wouldn't back down from that she would kill a seven-pound baby and that's what I realized when I took a look at this for the first time and I realized what their real agenda was and it changed my mind on it's one of the things that was really important that came out of me getting involved in that process at that time.
[01:48:53.720 --> 01:49:13.720]  I think Rand Paul has been an absolute master so far in terms of the way that he has put this stuff out and in terms of addressing vital issues that other people completely avoid. I am just absolutely stunned however that he has been in full-court press for this Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[01:49:13.720 --> 01:49:25.720]  He and Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio and all these people who want to run as Republicans for presidential candidate, they are all signing on to this agreement that is being negotiated by corporate lawyers and secret that we're not allowed to see.
[01:49:25.720 --> 01:49:34.720]  And it just absolutely amazes me that and I understand it's a difficult thing for a Republican to come up and say I oppose this free trade agreement.
[01:49:34.720 --> 01:49:43.720]  When they put it out there as a free trade agreement but you have to get ahead of that and you have to say that it is not free trade just like the Patriot Act is not patriotic.
[01:49:43.720 --> 01:49:54.720]  They put these labels on and they try to put you in a corner but real leadership is going to come out there and stand up for American sovereignty and for the American economy and we know how this is played out with NAFTA.
[01:49:54.720 --> 01:50:11.720]  We know that 20 years after, Patriots and others are saying America is finished. We no longer have America, we have North America. That's what they're saying and if you understand that's their mindset then the open borders makes absolute total sense and it makes sense as to why the Republicans won't do anything about open borders either.
[01:50:11.720 --> 01:50:19.720]  Absolutely. And it also sort of seems like they are expecting that it is the end of America.
[01:50:19.720 --> 01:50:27.720]  When you have people like Rand Paul who has been very outspoken against fast tracking the TVP and now he's kind of made an about face.
[01:50:27.720 --> 01:50:28.720]  Yeah, he did.
[01:50:28.720 --> 01:50:34.720]  Obviously a lot of things have been happening with China and Russia and them opening their new banking system and everything.
[01:50:34.720 --> 01:50:40.720]  So they know we've got to make this pivot to Asia but why can't we know what it means for America?
[01:50:40.720 --> 01:50:44.720]  How do we know it's good for America if we don't actually know what's in it?
[01:50:44.720 --> 01:50:54.720]  Well, Leon is going to be anchoring the nightly news tonight so join us then and I'm probably going to step in a little bit and we'll talk a little bit about Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Transatlantic Partnership.
[01:50:54.720 --> 01:51:14.720]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[01:51:25.720 --> 01:51:29.720]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:51:29.720 --> 01:51:34.720]  Hey, Boomer! I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[01:51:34.720 --> 01:51:38.720]  Good thing we have the Berkey system. It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[01:51:38.720 --> 01:51:43.720]  Mom says it's because the Berkey's filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaks only pure, delicious water.
[01:51:43.720 --> 01:51:45.720]  I know, right? You love it too!
[01:51:45.720 --> 01:51:48.720]  Yeah, I'm thirsty too. Let's go get some.
[01:51:48.720 --> 01:51:58.720]  Get Berkey clean water by calling 877-886-3653. That's 877-886-3653 or visit goberkey.com.
[01:51:58.720 --> 01:52:01.720]  I want more candy. I want more video games. Why, why, why?
[01:52:01.720 --> 01:52:11.720]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[01:52:11.720 --> 01:52:14.720]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[01:52:14.720 --> 01:52:24.720]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it, young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[01:52:24.720 --> 01:52:29.720]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[01:52:29.720 --> 01:52:35.720]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[01:52:35.720 --> 01:52:43.720]  We worked with the leading manufacturer and nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[01:52:43.720 --> 01:52:50.720]  Introducing Child Ease with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.

[01:54:40.720 --> 01:54:48.720]  But they will pay the banks first. We saw it happen in Venezuela where the Marxists did it and the bankers got 700% return on their investment.
[01:54:48.720 --> 01:54:57.720]  We see that it's happening now in Greece. It will happen here if push comes to shove. You need to be able to, you need to prepare for your family.
[01:54:57.720 --> 01:55:07.720]  You need to have things set aside so that if we have some kind of a drastic economic crisis and you never know how long it's going to take to come to fruition,
[01:55:07.720 --> 01:55:12.720]  you need to be prepared. That's why we have preppers. That's why we have people who are into preparedness.
[01:55:12.720 --> 01:55:20.720]  And again, at the InfoWars site, we have a way for you to do this with your food, something we don't talk about as often as we have in the past,
[01:55:20.720 --> 01:55:27.720]  but there's no better way to protect yourself and have a high quality emergency food supply than to get food from my Patriot supply.
[01:55:27.720 --> 01:55:37.720]  You can do that through the InfoWarsStore.com. Again, you can visit InfoWarsStore right now and you can prepare for your family whatever is coming with my Patriot supply.
[01:55:37.720 --> 01:55:46.720]  At the lowest price, we have available right there at InfoWarsStore. Of course, that supports our operation as well as lets you provide for an uncertain future.
[01:55:46.720 --> 01:55:54.720]  When we look at the military drills that are going, when we look at these partnerships, these trade agreements that are coming through,
[01:55:54.720 --> 01:56:05.720]  it looks very grim in the near future. And of course, all we need to have happen, Leigh Ann, is for the petrodollar to tank and then all bets are off as to what happens in this country economically.
[01:56:05.720 --> 01:56:12.720]  That's what's kept us in a financial budget, a bubble, should say, for 40 years. Is that petrodollar?
[01:56:12.720 --> 01:56:17.720]  Now, we were just talking about this book. It looks like it's going to be pretty revealing.
[01:56:17.720 --> 01:56:27.720]  But we have an article up on InfoWars.com, Hookers for Hillary. These are people that are in the Nevada...
[01:56:27.720 --> 01:56:29.720]  The Bunny Ranch.
[01:56:29.720 --> 01:56:36.720]  Bunny Ranch, which basically is legal prostitution in Nevada. It's illegal, I think, in Las Vegas, but in the state it's legal.
[01:56:36.720 --> 01:56:47.720]  And they're saying, one of the reasons that these Hookers, one of the reasons that they support her is because of her stance on foreign policy.
[01:56:47.720 --> 01:56:56.720]  They say that's one of the reasons they've endorsed her. And of course, endorsing her for foreign policy really is saying that she's really one of their own.
[01:56:56.720 --> 01:57:02.720]  Because she has offered herself essentially as a prostitute to these foreign governments, giving money to her foundation.
[01:57:02.720 --> 01:57:09.720]  Has Bill Clinton been collecting the donations from the Bunny Ranch in person?
[01:57:09.720 --> 01:57:11.720]  I don't know, yeah.
[01:57:11.720 --> 01:57:20.720]  Well, one of the things I said, that I'll stick by any woman that stands by her man in a cheating relationship so that she can further her career.
[01:57:20.720 --> 01:57:27.720]  There you go. I mean, she's furthering her career no matter what happens. And she's getting money from these foreign governments no matter what happens.
[01:57:27.720 --> 01:57:34.720]  I mean, she basically is, she's not really selling herself. She's selling us, which is really the bad thing.
[01:57:34.720 --> 01:57:41.720]  I guess you would call her not necessarily a hooker, but she would be a pimp. She's selling us into slavery.
[01:57:41.720 --> 01:57:46.720]  And she's selling us on the idea of selling ourselves. She is pimping us out.
[01:57:46.720 --> 01:57:58.720]  So it's apropos that there is now a hookers for Hillary group. But she wants us to believe that the idea that taking tens of millions of dollars from foreign governments,
[01:57:58.720 --> 01:58:04.720]  the idea that we would somehow be influenced by those donations is preposterous.
[01:58:04.720 --> 01:58:11.720]  For us to even accuse her of this is just an absurd conspiracy theory is what her campaign is saying.
[01:58:11.720 --> 01:58:22.720]  And they know that this at least gives the appearance of corruption because just last week the foundation revised their policy of where they're going to be able to be taking in these foreign donations.
[01:58:22.720 --> 01:58:30.720]  They're still going to be getting them from countries like Germany, Canada, the Netherlands and Britain, but they will prohibit giving by other nations in the Middle East.
[01:58:30.720 --> 01:58:37.720]  So they admit right there that they know that it's wrong. Thank you so much, Leanne McAdoo. She'll be doing the nightly news tonight and I'll probably be joining her as well.

[02:00:08.720 --> 02:00:34.720]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight. I'm going to be taking your calls in the next hour. I want to go over a little bit of news in this segment as well as in the next segment.
[02:00:34.720 --> 02:00:47.720]  I want to call in that number is 800-259-9231. I'd especially like to hear from people about the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Transatlantic Partnerships that are being negotiated by corporate lawyers in secret.
[02:00:47.720 --> 02:00:56.720]  I'd like to get your take on that. I want to talk a little bit about the media and about vaccines before I do. There's some stories that have come out about both of these issues right now.
[02:00:56.720 --> 02:01:05.720]  Of course, there's a story up on WorldNet Daily. MSNBC is in meltdown. They call it the media arm of the DNC, the Democrat National Committee.
[02:01:05.720 --> 02:01:20.720]  They say that it's in a tailspin. If they can only hold out for just a little bit longer, all of that cash that Hillary is collecting from foreign corporations through her foundations and from big Wall Street banks, she'll be spending that on ads on MSNBC.
[02:01:20.720 --> 02:01:30.720]  You can count on it. So just hang in there MSNBC because real soon the floodgates of cash are going to open up. All that Clinton cash is going to become in your way.
[02:01:30.720 --> 02:01:44.720]  And it's basically become a parody. Everybody knows that their ratings have absolutely collapsed because they have no integrity whatsoever because they've essentially just become cheerleaders for one political party.
[02:01:44.720 --> 02:01:50.720]  It's very sad to see that, but that's basically where most of the media is. You just have to ask yourself, which camp are they in?
[02:01:50.720 --> 02:02:02.720]  Of course, Fox News is in the camp of the Republicans as well as the big pharmaceutical companies. They're all in that camp. That's a bipartisan support that's going on there.
[02:02:02.720 --> 02:02:15.720]  Before we get to that, though, again, CNN also struggling in its ratings. It's reported by the Hollywood Reporter that they are hiring nearly 40 new political reporters in an effort to boost ratings.
[02:02:15.720 --> 02:02:21.720]  Again, these are going to be political reporters because this is going to be a big financial opportunity for them.
[02:02:21.720 --> 02:02:35.720]  When we talk about the political candidates spending $2 billion on their political campaigns, that money is going to be flowing to the networks who are desperately needing it because people really aren't watching them.
[02:02:35.720 --> 02:02:49.720]  Nevertheless, they will get that political cash coming in. So they want to get political correspondents that will talk about whether or not they left tips at Chipotle because that's really what they're going to talk about.
[02:02:49.720 --> 02:02:59.720]  They're not going to talk about anything of any substance. They're not going to pin these candidates down. If they did, they would lose their access. If they did, they would lose the commercial revenue that's going to them.
[02:02:59.720 --> 02:03:12.720]  So you're not going to see anything of any substance. You're going to have 40 new political reporters who are going to be reporting on all the minutiae, all of the trivia of the election, talking about it from a horse race standpoint.
[02:03:12.720 --> 02:03:19.720]  They can just talk about that forever and never ever talk about any of the issues. It's one of the reasons I'm happy that Rand Paul is running.
[02:03:19.720 --> 02:03:31.720]  As I mentioned, I'm very upset with his position on this sovereignty destroying, economy destroying trade agreement that's being negotiated right now between not only Asia but Europe.
[02:03:31.720 --> 02:03:38.720]  I'm very concerned that he would support that as a fast track. Nevertheless, he is still bringing some important things out to be talked about.
[02:03:38.720 --> 02:03:45.720]  So I really don't understand why he's supporting it. Nevertheless, moving on, look at this story from the Miami Herald.
[02:03:45.720 --> 02:03:55.720]  They admit that they spiked a story that would have been a scoop about the Bay of Pigs, the Miami Herald, the CIA, and the Bay of Pigs scoop that didn't run.
[02:03:55.720 --> 02:04:10.720]  It's a very interesting story that you'll find at themiamiherald.com. That's the type of thing that we used to see regularly. You would always see the same news stories on the same three major networks.
[02:04:10.720 --> 02:04:21.720]  They would all speak from the same script. And so therefore, if anybody said anything different, you were this radical, crazy, tinfoil hat fringe group that nobody would pay any attention to.
[02:04:21.720 --> 02:04:37.720]  That's why it is so important that we keep the internet free, that we have alternative media, not just info wars, but all the other people who are out there with cameras watching what's going on and the militarized exercises that we see throughout America at unprecedented levels.
[02:04:37.720 --> 02:04:44.720]  That's why we need citizen journalists. That's why it's very important to keep info wars there because we can be a clearinghouse for that as it comes in.
[02:04:44.720 --> 02:04:54.720]  So you don't get the news stories spiked like the Miami Herald did, like ABC, NBC, CBS, the rest of them did. Stay with us. We'll be right back.
[02:05:14.720 --> 02:05:34.720]  The Internet is an interconnected network of billions of sources, so you can research information for yourself from multiple sources, or you can blindly accept what you hear or read in the mainstream media, never questioning what you are being told.
[02:05:34.720 --> 02:05:46.720]  This gives you a false sense of reality. I mean, do you actually know what you think you know? Or have you been programmed to accept someone else's version of events? Think about it.
[02:05:46.720 --> 02:05:58.720]  This is Darren McBreen, and I want you to break the matrix at infowars.com and prisonplanet.tv and listen to the Alex Jones show because there's a war on your mind.
[02:05:58.720 --> 02:06:11.720]  In the near future. When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball. Security alert. This is Homeland Security. Analysis, info wars, building independent media operations.
[02:06:11.720 --> 02:06:19.720]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible. Prime Directive, discredit Alex Jones.
[02:06:19.720 --> 02:06:27.720]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theory. A popular conspiracy theory talk show called info wars. Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[02:06:27.720 --> 02:06:29.720]  These people are assaulting us.
[02:06:29.720 --> 02:06:31.720]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[02:06:31.720 --> 02:06:37.720]  They are never going to stop. They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[02:06:37.720 --> 02:06:47.720]  Block free iphone at infowars.com. Block free podcast and video feed. Imperatives destroy the planet TV.

[02:08:14.720 --> 02:08:27.720]  Leading up front to assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GZN radio network.
[02:08:27.720 --> 02:08:34.720]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm David Knight, your host today. We've been talking throughout this program about the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[02:08:34.720 --> 02:08:45.720]  We need to be aware of what's going on with us. We need to understand that it is very close to being dumped on Congress without being the possibility of making an amendment.
[02:08:45.720 --> 02:08:52.720]  It is something that I believe is very dangerous. I won't repeat what I said earlier about it, but you need to educate yourself.
[02:08:52.720 --> 02:09:00.720]  You need to educate others. We can do something to reverse this. We've seen a major reversal in people's understanding of the Second Amendment.
[02:09:00.720 --> 02:09:07.720]  We see a major reversal in people's understanding of what's going on with these so-called free trade agreements.
[02:09:07.720 --> 02:09:14.720]  We need to push back against this thing. It is almost too late. It's been developing for quite some time and they are rushing this through.
[02:09:14.720 --> 02:09:25.720]  The leadership of both parties is pushing for this very hard. They have been bought and sold by corporate multinational corporations who are going to be running this thing through.
[02:09:25.720 --> 02:09:32.720]  I have some of your calls here in just a moment. Before we do, I want to talk a little bit about some vaccine information that has come out.
[02:09:32.720 --> 02:09:38.720]  Things that I started to talk about in the last hour, but we didn't get all the way through some of the articles that were here.
[02:09:38.720 --> 02:09:44.720]  I also want to let you know that we've got a special way we support the operation here is with your purchase of our products.
[02:09:44.720 --> 02:09:51.720]  It's one of the key ways that we support it. Of course, right now we're offering a sale on SilverBullet at InfowarsLife.com.
[02:09:51.720 --> 02:09:58.720]  50% off. The biggest discount we've ever had on SilverBullet has gone from $29.95 down to $14.95.
[02:09:58.720 --> 02:10:04.720]  Of course, this is colloidal silver and a preparedness grade at a concentration of 30 parts per million.
[02:10:04.720 --> 02:10:09.720]  That's much higher than you'll find in most colloidal silvers. Again, that is available for 50% off.
[02:10:09.720 --> 02:10:14.720]  You'll save $15 per bottle. That's at InfowarsLife.com.
[02:10:14.720 --> 02:10:23.720]  I had mentioned earlier that there was this article I saw last week. It's like brain damage victims sue swine flu vaccine manufacturer,
[02:10:23.720 --> 02:10:26.720]  GlaxoSmithKline, and win $63 million in a lawsuit.
[02:10:26.720 --> 02:10:31.720]  I looked at that. I thought, how do they get any money in a lawsuit because we have this vaccine court in America
[02:10:31.720 --> 02:10:37.720]  which says you can't sue the pharmaceutical companies for damage that they do to you with vaccines, believe it or not.
[02:10:37.720 --> 02:10:46.720]  Well, that was because that was in the UK and they've gotten $9 billion worth of damages people in the UK in the last 12 years
[02:10:46.720 --> 02:10:52.720]  from just that one pharmaceutical company. But there's some very disturbing trends going on with vaccines.
[02:10:52.720 --> 02:10:58.720]  Of course, we all know they're trying to take away our informed consent, which is one of the things that separates us from slavery.
[02:10:58.720 --> 02:11:06.720]  It's one of the things that separates a society from the kind of contempt for the human that we saw at Nazi concentration camps.
[02:11:06.720 --> 02:11:16.720]  The Nuremberg Code said that we have to have informed consent before they can do anything to us, even if you try to justify it for the public good.
[02:11:16.720 --> 02:11:23.720]  That was what Mengele and other so-called doctors did at these camps. It's what the Japanese were doing.
[02:11:23.720 --> 02:11:28.720]  They were experimenting on humans, pulling their blood out, replacing it with seawater.
[02:11:28.720 --> 02:11:36.720]  Horrific experiments that they were doing on these individuals and say, well, it really doesn't matter because the individual is not as important as the collective.
[02:11:36.720 --> 02:11:46.720]  And this is for the collective good. Sounds a lot like these senators at the state level who are introducing these vaccine mandatory bills,
[02:11:46.720 --> 02:11:53.720]  saying, we don't really care about your informed consent. We don't really care if this is safe and effective for you.
[02:11:53.720 --> 02:11:58.720]  This is about the greater good of society. They admit that their vaccines don't convey immunity.
[02:11:58.720 --> 02:12:01.720]  So they have this thing they made up called herd immunity.
[02:12:01.720 --> 02:12:07.720]  Look, if you can't get individual immunity, herd immunity is just a figment of your imagination.
[02:12:07.720 --> 02:12:11.720]  Or I should say it's an invention of a pharmaceutical salesman.
[02:12:11.720 --> 02:12:15.720]  But look at some of the vaccines that are on the list, on their way to you.
[02:12:15.720 --> 02:12:25.720]  This is why you need to be very, very concerned about informed consent. Because we've pointed out that the vaccines that they're currently trying to force on you
[02:12:25.720 --> 02:12:30.720]  are not just simply vaccines in the way that Louis Pasteur put them together.
[02:12:30.720 --> 02:12:37.720]  No, Louis Pasteur never put, loaded his vaccines with preservatives, with adjuvants.
[02:12:37.720 --> 02:12:45.720]  He didn't put aluminum in it to try to annoy your immune system and create other issues with it.
[02:12:45.720 --> 02:12:49.720]  He didn't put formaldehyde in it so he could get longer shelf life and higher profits.
[02:12:49.720 --> 02:12:56.720]  And so that's why these are not, it's not simply about the science of vaccinations, about the idea of active immunity.
[02:12:56.720 --> 02:13:00.720]  No, it is far more than that. It's about the other things that they do to it as well.
[02:13:00.720 --> 02:13:03.720]  But look at what they're doing to the essence of the vaccines.
[02:13:03.720 --> 02:13:11.720]  We've got a company, this is a press release, GeoVax enters into the research collaboration agreement with the National Institute of Health
[02:13:11.720 --> 02:13:15.720]  for Ebola and Marburg vaccines. Now what are they doing?
[02:13:15.720 --> 02:13:26.720]  They're actually modifying the DNA, recombinant modified vaccines, vectored vaccines designed to produce non-infectious viruses or virus-like particles.
[02:13:26.720 --> 02:13:34.720]  So they're going in and genetically modifying the DNA of these viruses, like Ebola.
[02:13:34.720 --> 02:13:40.720]  Or as Daily Mail points out, also with cancer, also with the flu, also with HIV.
[02:13:40.720 --> 02:13:46.720]  So they're going in and genetically modifying these things and saying, well, you know, they won't make you sick.
[02:13:46.720 --> 02:13:53.720]  They'll just kind of look like it and then you will develop an active immunity against these diseases.
[02:13:53.720 --> 02:14:05.720]  Well, you know what could go wrong. You know that once they modify these things, it might be very much like what they're doing when they bring these diseases into the United States at the CDC
[02:14:05.720 --> 02:14:10.720]  and they do what they call gain-of-function experiments on them.
[02:14:10.720 --> 02:14:17.720]  They try to make these deadly viruses, as they did with the one that escaped the lab down in Tulane, and they still don't know how it got out of the primate lab there.
[02:14:17.720 --> 02:14:23.720]  Brookholderia pseudomalei is a deadly disease that is not indigenous to America.
[02:14:23.720 --> 02:14:28.720]  It was limited to a very, very small area of the world, primarily just in one country.
[02:14:28.720 --> 02:14:40.720]  They brought it to the United States along with a lot of these other things that they then use gain-of-function research to try to make these things, A, more deadly, and B, more easily contagious.
[02:14:40.720 --> 02:14:45.720]  And then they work on vaccines at the same time. How convenient.
[02:14:45.720 --> 02:14:54.720]  Now, what they're doing right now is they're making artificial DNA changes and artificial approximations of cancer, Ebola, flu, and HIV.
[02:14:54.720 --> 02:15:03.720]  They're doing that as vaccines because, of course, if they inject you with that and it isn't safe, they don't have any liability.
[02:15:03.720 --> 02:15:14.720]  And we should also understand that even when they use weakened real viruses or dead real viruses, they don't always get the response that they want.
[02:15:14.720 --> 02:15:18.720]  Remember this article from back in March 26 this year?
[02:15:18.720 --> 02:15:23.720]  Students contract whipping cough at a school that had a 99.5% vaccination rate.
[02:15:23.720 --> 02:15:27.720]  That's why I say herd immunity is nonsense. It's something they just made up.
[02:15:27.720 --> 02:15:32.720]  People are getting sick of this. They're getting sick of losing their informed consent.
[02:15:32.720 --> 02:15:36.720]  Even medical professionals are, I should say, especially medical professionals who know better.
[02:15:36.720 --> 02:15:41.720]  Listen to this article from the event Chronicle.
[02:15:41.720 --> 02:15:47.720]  And this is 22,000 nurses who are refusing to submit to mandatory vaccines.
[02:15:47.720 --> 02:15:50.720]  And we need to get these people on and talk to them.
[02:15:50.720 --> 02:15:57.720]  This is an organization called Nurses Against Mandatory Vaccines, N-A-M-V, Nurses Against Mandatory Vaccines.
[02:15:57.720 --> 02:16:09.720]  It was founded and formed because they were alarmed when they saw mandatory vaccination policies being introduced into the workplace as a requirement for having a job as a nurse having to get these vaccinations,
[02:16:09.720 --> 02:16:14.720]  which in many cases can make the nurse herself or himself contagious.
[02:16:14.720 --> 02:16:20.720]  They say N-A-M-V is not anti-vaccine, but it is pro-choice when it comes to vaccines.
[02:16:20.720 --> 02:16:24.720]  We believe all persons should have the right to choose and refuse medical treatment,
[02:16:24.720 --> 02:16:28.720]  and that means nurses and healthcare workers alike.
[02:16:28.720 --> 02:16:37.720]  You see, that's one of the things that really galls me is that so many of these people who are introducing these mandatory vaccines will say that they are pro-choice.
[02:16:37.720 --> 02:16:44.720]  And the only choice they would ever give anyone about anything in their life is whether or not to kill their child.
[02:16:44.720 --> 02:16:49.720]  Not about whether or not to vaccinate their child, not how their child would be educated.
[02:16:49.720 --> 02:16:54.720]  Nothing else in your life do they want you to have a choice to have a decision except that.
[02:16:54.720 --> 02:16:57.720]  And of course, you know what they're going to be pushing you for.
[02:16:57.720 --> 02:17:04.720]  But they point out, hospital systems are required to have a 90% or higher flu shot reception rate amongst their staff,
[02:17:04.720 --> 02:17:10.720]  or they lose up to 2% of their funding of Medicaid and Medicare.
[02:17:10.720 --> 02:17:12.720]  Well, now that's interesting, isn't it?
[02:17:12.720 --> 02:17:17.720]  Because we had this story that was up on April the 13th.
[02:17:17.720 --> 02:17:19.720]  Don Salazar had this on InfoWars.
[02:17:19.720 --> 02:17:26.720]  There was a nursing student who had filed a lawsuit claiming that the college instructed them to threaten patients into receiving vaccines.
[02:17:26.720 --> 02:17:31.720]  Now, one of the things that they were told if the patients didn't want to get their vaccine shots,
[02:17:31.720 --> 02:17:36.720]  they told them, tell them that you will lose your Medicaid if you don't get vaccinated.
[02:17:36.720 --> 02:17:41.720]  And if you lose your Medicaid, you will have to pay for your entire hospital stay.
[02:17:41.720 --> 02:17:43.720]  See, that's where they're getting this from.
[02:17:43.720 --> 02:17:46.720]  They are taking Medicaid and Medicare.
[02:17:46.720 --> 02:17:55.720]  The government is withholding that up to 2% if they don't get 90% or more of their staff vaccinated.
[02:17:55.720 --> 02:18:02.720]  Now, one of the staff looks at this and says, hey, we can lie to the patients and tell them that they will lose all their Medicaid coverage if they don't get vaccinated.
[02:18:02.720 --> 02:18:05.720]  Well, that's not true right now, but you wait.
[02:18:05.720 --> 02:18:07.720]  They're going to make it come true.
[02:18:07.720 --> 02:18:12.720]  Just like when that guy here in Austin says, oh, you see your sign there about banning firearms.
[02:18:12.720 --> 02:18:16.720]  Well, that's not true right now, but you hang on to that sign because it will become true.
[02:18:16.720 --> 02:18:20.720]  Yeah, they are going to start using that kind of leverage.
[02:18:20.720 --> 02:18:27.720]  In Australia and New Zealand, where they are taking welfare benefits from people who are on poor families,
[02:18:27.720 --> 02:18:30.720]  they're taking that away if they don't get their kids vaccinated.
[02:18:30.720 --> 02:18:35.720]  We also see kids getting kicked out of school in Washington state, Spokane, Washington.
[02:18:35.720 --> 02:18:43.720]  150 public school students in Spokane, Washington have been booted from school for lacking documentation to prove that they were vaccinated.
[02:18:43.720 --> 02:18:49.720]  They say the kids could not come back to class unless they get their shots or a state approved waiver.
[02:18:49.720 --> 02:18:56.720]  Why should I ever have to have a state approved waiver for whether or not my kids have been vaccinated?
[02:18:56.720 --> 02:19:06.720]  And of course, they say that they think this might even be bigger because they might have over 900 students in the district who have imperfect immunization records.
[02:19:06.720 --> 02:19:12.720]  Yeah, we're going to have to take more vaccines if we can't prove to them that we've had our vaccines.
[02:19:12.720 --> 02:19:16.720]  This is a very, very dangerous slippery slope.
[02:19:16.720 --> 02:19:19.720]  If they can treat you like this, they can do anything to you.
[02:19:19.720 --> 02:19:23.720]  If they can force you to take medical treatment, they can take all of your rights.
[02:19:23.720 --> 02:19:25.720]  And of course, they are taking all of our rights.
[02:19:25.720 --> 02:19:31.720]  The only reason they're coming for this one right now is because they have pretty much taken everything else that we have.
[02:19:31.720 --> 02:19:34.720]  This is one of the few rights that we still have.
[02:19:34.720 --> 02:19:42.720]  But when people stand up, we are seeing over and over again that the senators who have introduced these bills are withdrawing them.
[02:19:42.720 --> 02:19:47.720]  If you educate each other about what's at risk here, you can keep your freedom.
[02:19:47.720 --> 02:20:13.720]  Stay with us. We're going to be right back. We're going to take your calls 800-259-9231.

[02:21:00.720 --> 02:21:10.720]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[02:21:10.720 --> 02:21:13.720]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[02:21:13.720 --> 02:21:23.720]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it, young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[02:21:23.720 --> 02:21:28.720]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[02:21:28.720 --> 02:21:34.720]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[02:21:34.720 --> 02:21:42.720]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.

[02:23:03.720 --> 02:23:10.720]  We all live in a world today where things aren't what they seem. And if you think that news is real, you're living in a dream.
[02:23:10.720 --> 02:23:16.720]  Conditions don't run too deep to fight for you and me. They represent who, cause our trust will fill the corporate.
[02:23:16.720 --> 02:23:30.720]  I can't stand this no more. I don't want to give my freedom away.
[02:23:30.720 --> 02:23:40.720]  Everything, all we see, all that we are left to believe lies that we all must eat.
[02:23:40.720 --> 02:24:07.720]  It doesn't matter who you are for. It only matters what you buy.
[02:24:10.720 --> 02:24:18.720]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight and we're going to be taking your calls in this segment.
[02:24:18.720 --> 02:24:22.720]  We've got people lined up to talk to us about the Trans-Pacific Partnership we've been talking about.
[02:24:22.720 --> 02:24:30.720]  Also, vaccines, martial law, if you want to call, it's 800-259-9231. Let's go to Tim in Florida.
[02:24:30.720 --> 02:24:34.720]  Tim, you said you wanted to talk about these free trade agreements. Go ahead.
[02:24:34.720 --> 02:24:41.720]  Hello, David. Thanks for taking my call and you're doing a great job. I agree with much of what you're saying about TPP.
[02:24:41.720 --> 02:24:50.720]  I disagree with a bit of the rhetoric though. Certainly, TPP is a major step toward a global corporate government.
[02:24:50.720 --> 02:24:55.720]  But a monolithic world government is not what TPP will bring in the near term.
[02:24:55.720 --> 02:25:03.720]  Oh, it's true. It's a major, major step and it only has us, I think, about a half step to one step away from it. Go ahead.
[02:25:03.720 --> 02:25:11.720]  Right. Well, I would compare TPP to the mortar in a block wall. The mortar doesn't replace or supersede the blocks.
[02:25:11.720 --> 02:25:20.720]  It's designed to adhere the blocks, strengthen them and lock them in. The world's regional blocks like NAFTA, they're not going to go away anytime soon.
[02:25:20.720 --> 02:25:26.720]  I believe they're going to be the administrative branches of the world order if they get what they want done.
[02:25:26.720 --> 02:25:37.720]  But TPP is an inter-regional agreement involving four different regions. But except for NAFTA, the other three blocks involved only have several nations from each region participating.
[02:25:37.720 --> 02:25:46.720]  So here's what will happen. Those few nations will have to take the TPP template of regulations and commitments back to their respective regional blocks.
[02:25:46.720 --> 02:25:52.720]  And those commitments will then have to form the basis for further negotiations to integrate their own blocks.
[02:25:52.720 --> 02:25:56.720]  They will be committed to them. They'll have to insist that they be implemented.
[02:25:56.720 --> 02:26:10.720]  In the case of NAFTA, I've got a video of Mexico's ambassador to the U.S. at the time, Arturo Sorocan, who said that since all three NAFTA nations are in TPP, that it will be a backdoor means to strengthen NAFTA.
[02:26:10.720 --> 02:26:20.720]  It won't supersede or replace NAFTA. We're not being taken that jump to a monolithic world government. The blocks are going to have an integral part of this.
[02:26:20.720 --> 02:26:33.720]  Oh, absolutely. I agree. And I think it's interesting that here we are 20 years in as they're going to another level of this, that they're finally admitting that NAFTA was about sovereignty all along about unity.
[02:26:33.720 --> 02:26:42.720]  Previously, they would only talk about that within their meetings at the Bilderberg Group or within the studies that they did at the Council on Foreign Relations, like the one I mentioned 10 years ago.
[02:26:42.720 --> 02:26:51.720]  But I think, you know, when you're talking about this, only being a few nations that are involved that they'll have to do this individually, take a look at what's going on in Europe right now.
[02:26:51.720 --> 02:26:59.720]  With what's going on with Greece, you've had Alan Greenspan, you've had the PIMCO president, the world's largest bond fund, both saying that they need to get to a United States of Europe.
[02:26:59.720 --> 02:27:05.720]  And it's either going to be that or the EU is going to dissolve. And of course, everybody goes, oh, no, no, don't dissolve the EU.
[02:27:05.720 --> 02:27:10.720]  We need to take the next step. We need to go farther in. We need to surrender sovereignty to the EU.
[02:27:10.720 --> 02:27:13.720]  Once they do that, things can progress very rapidly there.
[02:27:13.720 --> 02:27:29.720]  And of course, we also saw that although you've got a pushback against that in the UK, even James Cameron trying to maneuver himself politically against UKIP there, who has basically made its name by pushing back against this loss of sovereignty.
[02:27:29.720 --> 02:27:40.720]  So the Conservative Party under James Cameron is trying to take away some of that support by saying, we're going to press for a renegotiation of the original European Union Treaty.
[02:27:40.720 --> 02:27:48.720]  And then the European Union Commission president says, you're not going to get to vote on that for another four years, which is something that he doesn't have the authority say.
[02:27:48.720 --> 02:27:55.720]  So you've already got a European Commission president who is usurping the authority that he had under the original treaty to shut down any changes to the treaty.
[02:27:55.720 --> 02:27:57.720]  What's your comments on that, Tim?
[02:27:57.720 --> 02:28:05.720]  I agree with you, David, on that. Europe is leading the way, but some of these other regions are lagging behind, and that's what TPP is designed to do.
[02:28:05.720 --> 02:28:13.720]  Now, I don't know, David, I had a video in the Info Wars contest several years ago.
[02:28:13.720 --> 02:28:20.720]  I have an update to that. I wish you guys would watch it and focus on these regions.
[02:28:20.720 --> 02:28:23.720]  Was that the one trading block, sir?
[02:28:23.720 --> 02:28:24.720]  Blockheads.
[02:28:24.720 --> 02:28:25.720]  Blockheads, yes.
[02:28:25.720 --> 02:28:28.720]  That was a very good one. We need to repost that.
[02:28:28.720 --> 02:28:33.720]  Well, it wasn't a great videographic masterpiece, but I had a lot of great information in it.
[02:28:33.720 --> 02:28:43.720]  I've got an update that I'd like you guys to consider focusing on these regions more, because it's really where it's at, and people are looking at it.
[02:28:43.720 --> 02:28:50.720]  But I've got an update called Global Shakedown, ISIS, Ukraine, and the New Cold War.
[02:28:50.720 --> 02:28:58.720]  And it will show the role of these regional blocks, all of them, how they are going to form the basis of this thing.
[02:28:58.720 --> 02:29:04.720]  And they're going to be around for a while and be part of this global structure, I'm sure.
[02:29:04.720 --> 02:29:15.720]  Well, yeah, I'd like to take a look at it. We'll take a look at that, and people should go back and look at blockheads, because that really does a great job of breaking down how they would consolidate these different regional areas,
[02:29:15.720 --> 02:29:21.720]  and then gradually, after they get regional consolidation, they would move to a larger consolidation.
[02:29:21.720 --> 02:29:28.720]  We're going to be right back with your calls. Stay there, Stefan in New York, as well as Richard in Arizona, Jerry in LA.
[02:29:28.720 --> 02:29:47.720]  We're going to be right back with your calls. Stay with us.
[02:29:58.720 --> 02:30:03.720]  We all know the countless cases where young black men had drugs or guns planted on them by police.
[02:30:03.720 --> 02:30:08.720]  Now the tables have turned by former black police officer Jeffrey Walker from Daily Mail.
[02:30:08.720 --> 02:30:17.720]  A disgraced ex-police officer testifying against his drug squad colleagues acknowledged on Tuesday that he stole drug money, planted evidence, and lied on paperwork too many times to count.
[02:30:17.720 --> 02:30:23.720]  His victims, in his own words, were white college boy khaki pants types who were easy to intimidate.
[02:30:23.720 --> 02:30:32.720]  While Mr. Walker is out of a job, maybe he should try his hand at the DEA. Apparently having wild sex parties and accepting gifts from drug dealers and working with the Sinaloa cartel is no big deal.
[02:30:32.720 --> 02:30:43.720]  DEA head Michelle Leonhardt said, I can't fire, I can't recommend a penalty when asked why she has not fired or revoked the security clearance of agents named in the March 2015 OIG report,
[02:30:43.720 --> 02:30:48.720]  which included an account of an agent hitting a prostitute in the face with a glass over a money dispute.
[02:30:48.720 --> 02:30:53.720]  However, you can probably get a job with the biggest drug dealers on earth and continue your disreputable ways.

[02:33:10.720 --> 02:33:21.720]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:21.720 --> 02:33:24.720]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight, your host today.
[02:33:24.720 --> 02:33:28.720]  We're talking to callers about the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[02:33:28.720 --> 02:33:31.720]  We've also got some callers on hold about vaccines.
[02:33:31.720 --> 02:33:34.720]  We were just talking to one gentleman, Tim.
[02:33:34.720 --> 02:33:37.720]  He did an excellent job, I thought, when we had the Paul Revere contest.
[02:33:37.720 --> 02:33:41.720]  And that's why it is very important to get the information out there.
[02:33:41.720 --> 02:33:45.720]  You can always have a big effect yourself if you put out some information.
[02:33:45.720 --> 02:33:51.720]  If you take video of what's going on in your community, if you put together a documentary like Tim did, it was called Blockheads.
[02:33:51.720 --> 02:33:57.720]  It's a great way to fill in some background as to what's going on with these trade agreements.
[02:33:57.720 --> 02:34:05.720]  Again, we're trying to consolidate the North American Union with Europe and with the Pacific countries in terms of, they say, a trade agreement.
[02:34:05.720 --> 02:34:09.720]  It is not a free trade agreement alone. It is not a good deal even for trade.
[02:34:09.720 --> 02:34:15.720]  It's managed to trade, managed for the benefit of the multinational corporations that are negotiating this in secret.
[02:34:15.720 --> 02:34:21.720]  But it is a massive plan towards taking down our sovereignty.
[02:34:21.720 --> 02:34:26.720]  And if you don't understand what's going on at the border, then take a look at NAFTA.
[02:34:26.720 --> 02:34:36.720]  If you don't understand how we are losing our economic base, how we've lost 700,000 jobs, 61% of those in manufacturing, take a look at NAFTA.
[02:34:36.720 --> 02:34:46.720]  If you want to know why our deficit has been so large and growing for the last 20-some-odd years that we've had NAFTA, then take a closer look at it.
[02:34:46.720 --> 02:34:54.720]  That is all going to be repeated, but even worse in the trade agreements that are being negotiated now that have been fast tracked.
[02:34:54.720 --> 02:34:57.720]  So educate yourself about it, educate others about it.
[02:34:57.720 --> 02:35:00.720]  Let's talk to Stephen in New York about the trade agreement.
[02:35:00.720 --> 02:35:02.720]  Stephen, go ahead.
[02:35:02.720 --> 02:35:05.720]  Hey, how are you doing, Dave?
[02:35:05.720 --> 02:35:08.720]  I mean, I always get here and you have a great voice.
[02:35:08.720 --> 02:35:10.720]  She's telling you to be on 10-10-1.
[02:35:10.720 --> 02:35:21.720]  But the point is this, wouldn't you say that between the trade agreement and between the real kingtons, the real players that are making this happen,
[02:35:21.720 --> 02:35:24.720]  I just want to voice an analysis.
[02:35:24.720 --> 02:35:32.720]  Maybe you could tell me what you think, but wouldn't you say that this is really just a gigantic, if you were to look at this whole thing in a bird's eye view,
[02:35:32.720 --> 02:35:35.720]  it looks to me just like a gigantic hedge fund.
[02:35:35.720 --> 02:35:44.720]  Now, I know you're pretty business savvy and you can somewhat understand that it's really like between sorrows and between all the real nature players.
[02:35:44.720 --> 02:35:53.720]  It's really just maybe a thousand-man hedge fund and that's pretty much what we're waging more against.
[02:35:53.720 --> 02:35:59.720]  I mean, you can say that it's a tyranny that we're up against or whatever forces you want to call it.
[02:35:59.720 --> 02:36:03.720]  But the way I see it is it's a hedge fund that we're up against.
[02:36:03.720 --> 02:36:08.720]  And I was just thinking, how do people bring down hedge funds?
[02:36:08.720 --> 02:36:13.720]  Maybe if we can look at it from another angle, I mean, don't get me wrong, your angle is always on point.
[02:36:13.720 --> 02:36:19.720]  I'm not saying we change your angle, but I was just thinking maybe looking at this as breaking down a hedge fund
[02:36:19.720 --> 02:36:25.720]  and maybe that might give us some new answers in how we can counter this whole thing.
[02:36:25.720 --> 02:36:27.720]  It's a truly bad counter-attack.
[02:36:27.720 --> 02:36:31.720]  I feel like we're talking about it, which is good.
[02:36:31.720 --> 02:36:35.720]  To a point, I feel like we're just in a sewing circle just talking about it.
[02:36:35.720 --> 02:36:37.720]  No one's really countering them.
[02:36:37.720 --> 02:36:39.720]  I mean, we actually have no reason to do that.
[02:36:39.720 --> 02:36:40.720]  I don't know what we do.
[02:36:40.720 --> 02:36:44.720]  I mean, part of it is education. I think we stopped the war in Syria when we educated people about it.
[02:36:44.720 --> 02:36:50.720]  And I think we basically didn't have to go to war with the ATF in this country
[02:36:50.720 --> 02:36:53.720]  because we educated people about what their gun control agenda is.
[02:36:53.720 --> 02:36:59.720]  And so now we see that by two to one margin, people are more interested in using the Second Amendment
[02:36:59.720 --> 02:37:05.720]  and seeing it as a means of protecting themselves than being afraid of it and embracing gun control
[02:37:05.720 --> 02:37:09.720]  because somehow if the government is the only one with guns, then we're going to be safe.
[02:37:09.720 --> 02:37:13.720]  So we've won that argument through education.
[02:37:13.720 --> 02:37:14.720]  It's been done peacefully.
[02:37:14.720 --> 02:37:20.720]  And of course, how do we take down a syndicate like this that can control the markets?
[02:37:20.720 --> 02:37:22.720]  Because that's what the central bankers do.
[02:37:22.720 --> 02:37:24.720]  That's what the multinational corporations do.
[02:37:24.720 --> 02:37:26.720]  They can control the markets.
[02:37:26.720 --> 02:37:29.720]  And when you go back to the Federal Reserve, when it was first put in place,
[02:37:29.720 --> 02:37:31.720]  you go back to some of the people who spoke against it.
[02:37:31.720 --> 02:37:36.720]  I think it was Charles Lindbergh's father, who was a senator or congressman at the time.
[02:37:36.720 --> 02:37:41.720]  And he said, what you're doing is you're putting in place a system where these people can control the markets.
[02:37:41.720 --> 02:37:47.720]  They will know precisely when they are going to make business conditions favorable or less favorable.
[02:37:47.720 --> 02:37:48.720]  They'll be able to time the market.
[02:37:48.720 --> 02:37:51.720]  They will be able to precipitate crashes.
[02:37:51.720 --> 02:37:53.720]  And of course, that's exactly what we have.
[02:37:53.720 --> 02:38:00.720]  And if we let this go through, we are going to be allowing these multinational corporations to be elevated
[02:38:00.720 --> 02:38:05.720]  to the position of being sovereign states, actually greater than sovereign states.
[02:38:05.720 --> 02:38:08.720]  They'll be able to go in an arbitration process.
[02:38:08.720 --> 02:38:13.720]  And they'll say, well, you just outlawed Monsanto's glyphosates,
[02:38:13.720 --> 02:38:18.720]  so Monsanto can sue you under this trade agreement for damages
[02:38:18.720 --> 02:38:23.720]  and your taxpayers or your sovereign government will have to pay for it and go into debt to the bankers.
[02:38:23.720 --> 02:38:30.720]  I think really, Stephen, the best thing we can do is try to get people to understand what this is about.
[02:38:30.720 --> 02:38:33.720]  Not only is it just about economics.
[02:38:33.720 --> 02:38:35.720]  There's a lot of people in the Democrat Party.
[02:38:35.720 --> 02:38:39.720]  There are traditional constituents in unions who are complaining very loudly about this.
[02:38:39.720 --> 02:38:46.720]  But most of the people who are in the Republican Party see this as falsely, I believe, as a free trade agreement.
[02:38:46.720 --> 02:38:49.720]  Now, I'm all for free markets, but this is not a free market.
[02:38:49.720 --> 02:38:52.720]  This is not a free market agreement. This is nothing of the sort.
[02:38:52.720 --> 02:38:53.720]  This is crony capitalism.
[02:38:53.720 --> 02:39:00.720]  And I think a lot of people in the Tea Party and elsewhere woke up to the idea that crony capitalism is not capitalism.
[02:39:00.720 --> 02:39:06.720]  Crony capitalism is not a free market, and they need to understand that these trade agreements that are being negotiated right now
[02:39:06.720 --> 02:39:12.720]  are very different animals and free trade agreements, and they're far more comprehensive than just trade.
[02:39:12.720 --> 02:39:16.720]  So I don't know when you're talking about trying to take down a hedge fund.
[02:39:16.720 --> 02:39:21.720]  I'm really not sure what we would do along that line, but I think it's really more of an educational issue.
[02:39:21.720 --> 02:39:24.720]  Do you have anything else that you would add to that?
[02:39:24.720 --> 02:39:31.720]  I mean, as to that, not really. The only thing I was going to say is the Jade Health thing, what really stuck out to me,
[02:39:31.720 --> 02:39:35.720]  is the fact that they want people to give them nuggets of information.
[02:39:35.720 --> 02:39:40.720]  I don't know what Afghani civilians would give US troops nuggets of information.
[02:39:40.720 --> 02:39:42.720]  It just doesn't translate with me.
[02:39:42.720 --> 02:39:47.720]  But back to the hedge fund thing, the only reason why I was calling it a hedge fund is because I see all these investors,
[02:39:47.720 --> 02:39:54.720]  like solos, investing money into stir up riots, God knows who investing money to make the trade agreement happen.
[02:39:54.720 --> 02:40:00.720]  It seems to me just like a hedge fund, and like every hedge fund, there's a hedge fund operator.
[02:40:00.720 --> 02:40:06.720]  And who, I just probably not just one operating, I mean, I don't know.
[02:40:06.720 --> 02:40:10.720]  Well, yeah, quite frankly, they are there, and it is really the market manipulation, of course.
[02:40:10.720 --> 02:40:17.720]  It's not just making money if it goes down, like protecting themselves against a loss and making money if it goes down.
[02:40:17.720 --> 02:40:21.720]  They can make money if it goes up, because they can control which direction it's going to go.
[02:40:21.720 --> 02:40:23.720]  And that's the key thing to understand about these people.
[02:40:23.720 --> 02:40:26.720]  And we need to back that kind of concentration.
[02:40:26.720 --> 02:40:31.720]  You want to know why you're getting a 1% of a 1% of a 1% with all the money?
[02:40:31.720 --> 02:40:35.720]  Go back and look at these trade agreements. That's really what is setting this up.
[02:40:35.720 --> 02:40:37.720]  Let's go to Richard in Arizona.
[02:40:37.720 --> 02:40:40.720]  Richard, you said you wanted to talk about vaccines. Thank you, Stefan.
[02:40:40.720 --> 02:40:42.720]  Let's go to Richard.
[02:40:42.720 --> 02:40:44.720]  Hi, David. Am I coming through okay?
[02:40:44.720 --> 02:40:46.720]  Yeah, you're on. Go ahead.
[02:40:46.720 --> 02:40:52.720]  Okay. I've been a really strong supporter of InfoWars for 20 years or so.
[02:40:52.720 --> 02:40:58.720]  And I have to correct you on something, and I hope that you will pass it on to Alex also.
[02:40:58.720 --> 02:40:59.720]  Okay, sure.
[02:40:59.720 --> 02:41:05.720]  Once in a while, InfoWars is inadvertently giving out some information that's not correct.
[02:41:05.720 --> 02:41:11.720]  And in this case, it's about vaccines. And this is something I know a lot about.
[02:41:11.720 --> 02:41:18.720]  And when Jenner started it out, there were no adjuvants being put in the vaccine.
[02:41:18.720 --> 02:41:24.720]  And if you look at the history, not from a government source, but from a real source, and I have some of those,
[02:41:24.720 --> 02:41:29.720]  you find that the vaccines were starting and spreading epidemics in the beginning,
[02:41:29.720 --> 02:41:32.720]  and they killed a lot of people, and there were no adjuvants.
[02:41:32.720 --> 02:41:40.720]  So this idea that the theory is unquestionable and that clean vaccines would be great is seriously flawed and it's not true.
[02:41:40.720 --> 02:41:45.720]  And then when you look at the history of the next several hundred years through Europe,
[02:41:45.720 --> 02:41:48.720]  vaccines were banned many times before adjuvants even started.
[02:41:48.720 --> 02:41:51.720]  And the reason they were banned is because it killed people.
[02:41:51.720 --> 02:41:58.720]  And the fact that these little things in the bloodstream, which they arbitrarily call antibodies,
[02:41:58.720 --> 02:42:02.720]  show up when the body tries to defend itself against this kind of assault,
[02:42:02.720 --> 02:42:06.720]  which is not how it gets immunity in nature, not what it's programmed for.
[02:42:06.720 --> 02:42:12.720]  They assume that that means there's immunity, but we know people are getting these diseases,
[02:42:12.720 --> 02:42:17.720]  including measles and everything else, with lots of antibodies, and they get them right after they get the shot.
[02:42:17.720 --> 02:42:22.720]  And they also have great immunity in many people that have no antibodies.
[02:42:22.720 --> 02:42:30.720]  So that's the serious, seriously questionable, and when you look at what Pasteur originally said with his germ theory of disease,
[02:42:30.720 --> 02:42:32.720]  he actually was not the originator of it.
[02:42:32.720 --> 02:42:38.720]  He stole it from somebody named Beauchamp, and both of them recanted that disease before they died when it was too late
[02:42:38.720 --> 02:42:41.720]  and it was taking off as an industry.
[02:42:41.720 --> 02:42:48.720]  And they said, basically, in short terms, the germs are nothing, the terrain is everything.
[02:42:48.720 --> 02:42:52.720]  In other words, the germs are attracted to where there's degeneration going on,
[02:42:52.720 --> 02:42:56.720]  and they may have toxic byproducts, but they weren't the original cause.
[02:42:56.720 --> 02:43:02.720]  So the whole theory of it and the idea that if it was clean, it would be legitimate is completely bogus
[02:43:02.720 --> 02:43:05.720]  that nobody is willing to say that publicly.
[02:43:05.720 --> 02:43:07.720]  I don't disagree with you.
[02:43:07.720 --> 02:43:13.720]  I haven't researched that as thoroughly as you have to say that I wouldn't go with any active immunity.
[02:43:13.720 --> 02:43:19.720]  I will say this, that that's going to be a much, much harder sell to get people to understand that
[02:43:19.720 --> 02:43:26.720]  than to get them to understand that dangerous things are being added to the vaccines that in and of themselves can cause problems.
[02:43:26.720 --> 02:43:27.720]  People can understand that.
[02:43:27.720 --> 02:43:29.720]  They can understand harmful additives to their food.
[02:43:29.720 --> 02:43:31.720]  That's why they buy organic.
[02:43:31.720 --> 02:43:34.720]  That's why organic is surging in the marketplace.
[02:43:34.720 --> 02:43:37.720]  They can understand that preservatives are dangerous.
[02:43:37.720 --> 02:43:41.720]  They can understand that injecting people with aluminum is dangerous.
[02:43:41.720 --> 02:43:44.720]  So it's easier, I think, to get people to understand that.
[02:43:44.720 --> 02:43:49.720]  It's also, I think, easier to focus on the fact that we need to have decisions,
[02:43:49.720 --> 02:43:52.720]  we need to have minimums to make decisions about our life,
[02:43:52.720 --> 02:43:56.720]  especially about what we have in terms of medical treatment,
[02:43:56.720 --> 02:44:02.720]  that if we don't have that capability, we truly are in a dangerous slave situation.
[02:44:02.720 --> 02:44:04.720]  So that's what I've tried to focus on.
[02:44:04.720 --> 02:44:09.720]  I know there are people who have a lot of issues with vaccines per se, and I don't dispute that.
[02:44:09.720 --> 02:44:11.720]  I haven't researched that as much as you have.
[02:44:11.720 --> 02:44:19.720]  I will just say that we need to focus on the idea that you don't force people to get any kind of medical treatment.
[02:44:19.720 --> 02:44:21.720]  It's one of the reasons why I oppose fluoride.
[02:44:21.720 --> 02:44:25.720]  How can you force people, force medicate people in the water supply?
[02:44:25.720 --> 02:44:26.720]  How could you ever justify that?
[02:44:26.720 --> 02:44:30.720]  First of all, you can't even control the dosage when you dump it into the water supply.
[02:44:30.720 --> 02:44:35.720]  But who gives you the right government to force medical treatment on people
[02:44:35.720 --> 02:44:37.720]  to say that we have determined that this is for your own good?
[02:44:37.720 --> 02:44:43.720]  We should have had this discussion from that perspective with fluoride, I think, a long time ago,
[02:44:43.720 --> 02:44:46.720]  to say that you're not going to force medical treatment on me.
[02:44:46.720 --> 02:44:49.720]  And now what we see is that this kind of leverage is being used on people
[02:44:49.720 --> 02:44:53.720]  in terms of your kids can't come to school, and as Joe Jennings just pointed out,
[02:44:53.720 --> 02:44:56.720]  hey, if your kids are truant, they're eventually going to come after you
[02:44:56.720 --> 02:44:58.720]  and put you in jail if you don't get these kids vaccinated.
[02:44:58.720 --> 02:45:00.720]  That's the ultimate leverage that they've got.
[02:45:00.720 --> 02:45:02.720]  Or going to poor families that are on welfare and saying,
[02:45:02.720 --> 02:45:07.720]  we're going to withhold your welfare payments unless you do this, or blackmailing hospitals
[02:45:07.720 --> 02:45:12.720]  and saying that unless you vaccinate all of your staff, you're not going to get Medicaid or Medicare.
[02:45:12.720 --> 02:45:15.720]  There's so many ways that they can hold a gun to our head,
[02:45:15.720 --> 02:45:19.720]  and I think we really need to focus on the civil liberties aspect.
[02:45:19.720 --> 02:45:26.720]  And then once we've established and made safe again the right that we have informed consent,
[02:45:26.720 --> 02:45:30.720]  then we can have a real discussion about every aspect of vaccines.
[02:45:30.720 --> 02:45:32.720]  And I think we do need to have that discussion.
[02:45:32.720 --> 02:45:34.720]  Was there anything else you want to add to that, Richard?
[02:45:34.720 --> 02:45:39.720]  Yeah, real quick. One thing on that, and then a comment on your issue about free trade.
[02:45:39.720 --> 02:45:43.720]  On strategically and politically, I completely agree with what you just said.
[02:45:43.720 --> 02:45:49.720]  I just want you and Alex and everyone there to know that behind the scenes that nobody will talk about,
[02:45:49.720 --> 02:45:56.720]  I've looked, there's no validity to the basic theory of vaccination, and I know that's taboo to say that.
[02:45:56.720 --> 02:46:04.720]  Now, the thing about free trade is that the only purpose of the free trade agreements from NASA to the higher world agreements
[02:46:04.720 --> 02:46:10.720]  is to destroy national sovereignty and national economies to facilitate world government.
[02:46:10.720 --> 02:46:16.720]  I see nothing else other than a huge red flag with Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
[02:46:16.720 --> 02:46:20.720]  Yes, yes. I cannot understand why they are supporting that.
[02:46:20.720 --> 02:46:22.720]  And she said it is a huge red flag.
[02:46:22.720 --> 02:46:26.720]  They need to explain to people, and if we have people who are educated on the issue,
[02:46:26.720 --> 02:46:30.720]  understand what is really behind this and we need to talk to them.
[02:46:30.720 --> 02:46:33.720]  Maybe they can give us an answer. Maybe they can explain it to me.
[02:46:33.720 --> 02:46:38.720]  I don't know how they justify it, but they need to justify that because if they don't,
[02:46:38.720 --> 02:46:46.720]  all of the rest of this stuff could just be that they are some kind of a libertarian front to try to get somebody's support for this.
[02:46:46.720 --> 02:46:49.720]  I think we're not going to fix it by sending somebody to Washington anyway.
[02:46:49.720 --> 02:46:53.720]  I think it's going to be done outside. I think Washington is too big, too corrupt.
[02:46:53.720 --> 02:46:55.720]  It needs to be shut down from the outside. It needs to be contained.
[02:46:55.720 --> 02:46:58.720]  It's like some kind of a cancer that needs to be contained.
[02:46:58.720 --> 02:47:00.720]  Thank you, Richard. Let's go to Mark in California.
[02:47:00.720 --> 02:47:03.720]  Mark, you said you want to talk about Jade Helm.
[02:47:03.720 --> 02:47:06.720]  Hey, David. Doing a great job, by the way.
[02:47:06.720 --> 02:47:07.720]  Thank you.
[02:47:07.720 --> 02:47:10.720]  Yeah, I just got two quick points on Jade Helm.
[02:47:10.720 --> 02:47:15.720]  First, we know that they're lying to us, obviously, coming from a veteran.
[02:47:15.720 --> 02:47:20.720]  But whenever we train, we train for climate specific.
[02:47:20.720 --> 02:47:23.720]  We train for terrain specific.
[02:47:23.720 --> 02:47:31.720]  So, I mean, if they were going to train for a Middle Eastern engagement, they'd be training in the desert.
[02:47:31.720 --> 02:47:41.720]  Yes, absolutely. And they wouldn't be dressing in American civilian clothing and trying to move undetected amongst the American population.
[02:47:41.720 --> 02:47:45.720]  Why would that be a challenge to them? And how would that possibly help them in another country?
[02:47:45.720 --> 02:47:53.720]  And, of course, we had the video that we put up on Infowars from someone who went to the Dirty Bomb Drill in Richmond, California,
[02:47:53.720 --> 02:47:58.720]  that showed them doing crowd control and having one of the role-playing actors yell,
[02:47:58.720 --> 02:48:01.720]  I'm a sovereign citizen. I don't have to listen to you.
[02:48:01.720 --> 02:48:04.720]  And, of course, at that point, that was their cue to charge, I guess.
[02:48:04.720 --> 02:48:08.720]  So, we know from their scenarios, we know from the way that they train and where they train.
[02:48:08.720 --> 02:48:16.720]  What you're talking about, Mark, is exactly what they had somebody say when they were covering the drills a couple of years ago,
[02:48:16.720 --> 02:48:19.720]  that they were doing, I think it was in LA at the time.
[02:48:19.720 --> 02:48:21.720]  And they had a military officer who said exactly what you said.
[02:48:21.720 --> 02:48:23.720]  We're going to train in the mountains if we're going to fight in the mountains.
[02:48:23.720 --> 02:48:25.720]  We're going to train in the desert if we're going to fight in the desert.
[02:48:25.720 --> 02:48:27.720]  So, we train the way we're going to fight.
[02:48:27.720 --> 02:48:36.720]  And it's like, so why can't people understand that they're training with the police in LA to control civil unrest?
[02:48:36.720 --> 02:48:38.720]  Why can't they understand that?
[02:48:38.720 --> 02:48:41.720]  I mean, like I said before, I've been in AP Hill with bigs.
[02:48:41.720 --> 02:48:43.720]  We see how they've been training.
[02:48:43.720 --> 02:48:45.720]  We see that they work with the police.
[02:48:45.720 --> 02:48:51.720]  There isn't really any difference between a militarized police or using the military as police.
[02:48:51.720 --> 02:48:54.720]  I mean, those are both violations of Posse Comitatus.
[02:48:54.720 --> 02:48:56.720]  That's something that everybody needs to be concerned about.
[02:48:56.720 --> 02:48:58.720]  Go ahead, Mark.
[02:48:58.720 --> 02:49:06.720]  Also, I say you have video, someone got a great video off the I-15 in California. It's on the road out to Vegas.
[02:49:06.720 --> 02:49:10.720]  And it's a pretty notorious area right by Barstow.
[02:49:10.720 --> 02:49:12.720]  And there is a huge buildup.
[02:49:12.720 --> 02:49:17.720]  The name of the video I sent to show tips is Jade Helm, huge buildup.
[02:49:17.720 --> 02:49:23.720]  But it's a video about 15 minutes and there's not hundreds, but there are thousands of MRAPs,
[02:49:23.720 --> 02:49:29.720]  thousands of Humvees, thousands of APCs and they're staging.
[02:49:29.720 --> 02:49:33.720]  They're being staged for something and this is not a rapid deployment base at all.
[02:49:33.720 --> 02:49:36.720]  I mean, they're being staged for something in California.
[02:49:36.720 --> 02:49:38.720]  Well, you know, and that's my concern.
[02:49:38.720 --> 02:49:47.720]  I said this before, I believe that this mad rush to try to get MRAPs and APCs into police departments,
[02:49:47.720 --> 02:49:52.720]  even into the smallest, most peaceful rural communities, pushing out all the stops to try to get these in.
[02:49:52.720 --> 02:49:56.720]  I think that is advanced placement to try to get these things in those areas.
[02:49:56.720 --> 02:49:58.720]  You're talking about something completely different, I understand.
[02:49:58.720 --> 02:50:03.720]  But I think even that is a pre-positioning of military assets into these areas.
[02:50:03.720 --> 02:50:09.720]  And I think it's very interesting to understand that it was just last summer that they shut down a 60-year-old program
[02:50:09.720 --> 02:50:16.720]  to provide that kind of equipment to rural fire departments because they wanted to get it in the hands of people who had arresting capability.
[02:50:16.720 --> 02:50:19.720]  That's exactly what they said in the Section 1033 program.
[02:50:19.720 --> 02:50:23.720]  They wanted to get it in the hands of people who had arresting power.
[02:50:23.720 --> 02:50:25.720]  So they would take it away from the firefighters.
[02:50:25.720 --> 02:50:32.720]  Nevertheless, they will tell you that this is therefore some kind of a natural emergency or something like that.
[02:50:32.720 --> 02:50:36.720]  Simply don't buy it, just like people don't buy what's going on with Walmart.
[02:50:36.720 --> 02:50:39.720]  There's something screwy about these Walmart closures.
[02:50:39.720 --> 02:50:41.720]  Everybody knows that they're lying to us.
[02:50:41.720 --> 02:50:43.720]  We don't know exactly at this point what the lie is.
[02:50:43.720 --> 02:50:47.720]  That's why people are starting to guess about it.
[02:50:47.720 --> 02:50:49.720]  But the same thing happens with the government.
[02:50:49.720 --> 02:50:52.720]  We know when they're lying to us, and that's when we start doing the investigation.
[02:50:52.720 --> 02:51:18.720]  Stay with us. We're going to take more of your calls. We'll be right back.
[02:51:22.720 --> 02:51:24.720]  This is Ted Anderson.
[02:51:52.720 --> 02:51:57.720]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:52:22.720 --> 02:52:27.720]  I'm looking like a white Bruce Lee to looking like a job of the hut.
[02:52:27.720 --> 02:52:32.720]  So I began a journey five years ago to shed the almost 100 pounds.
[02:52:32.720 --> 02:52:37.720]  I started taking super male vitality and saw dramatic results in just a few weeks.
[02:52:37.720 --> 02:52:45.720]  When I added to the mix the key products developed by Dr. Group for M4WarsLife.com, the results were incredible.
[02:52:45.720 --> 02:52:49.720]  Take the M4WarsLife.com challenge today at M4WarsLife.com

[02:54:10.720 --> 02:54:14.720]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight and I'll be taking your calls this segment.
[02:54:14.720 --> 02:54:19.720]  We're going to try to get to Jerry, John, Omar, Daniel. If we can't make it through all you guys will hang on.
[02:54:19.720 --> 02:54:21.720]  We'll take you into overdrive.
[02:54:21.720 --> 02:54:31.720]  The last call that we had was talking about a massive buildup of MRAPs, APCs, things like that on Highway 15, California.
[02:54:31.720 --> 02:54:34.720]  Kind of heading from California out to Vegas.
[02:54:34.720 --> 02:54:44.720]  And as Joe Jennings was talking about, he says he's driven down that highway many times because it's absolutely desolate and if it's the route that I took from LA to Vegas, yeah, it is.
[02:54:44.720 --> 02:54:49.720]  There's nothing out there. So it's pretty interesting to see that clip if that's the one that he was talking about.
[02:54:49.720 --> 02:54:51.720]  It seemed to be the one he was talking about.
[02:54:51.720 --> 02:54:59.720]  And of course, that's not too far from the area in Southern California that they showed as being part of the Jade Helm exercise.
[02:54:59.720 --> 02:55:09.720]  So we're going to go back to your calls in just one moment. But first, just want to let you know that we've got a sale right now of 50% off of InfoWars Silver Bullet.
[02:55:09.720 --> 02:55:15.720]  It's the biggest sale we've ever had, a Silver Bullet. Save about $15 off of this. It's $14.95, usually $29.95.
[02:55:15.720 --> 02:55:21.720]  And again, that's our concentrated colloidal silver, 30 parts per million. You can get that at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:55:21.720 --> 02:55:32.720]  Of course, we also have specials on our water filters, 10% off all pro pure water filters with a promo code water right now at InfoWarsStore.com and also my Patriot supply.
[02:55:32.720 --> 02:55:38.720]  Don't forget emergency food supplies. You should always have that as a backup because you never know what's going to happen.
[02:55:38.720 --> 02:55:42.720]  It could be political, it could be economic, it could be some kind of a natural disaster.
[02:55:42.720 --> 02:55:48.720]  So always make sure that you've got clean water and food that you can feed your family.
[02:55:48.720 --> 02:55:53.720]  Get that there and support the operation as you provide for your own at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:55:53.720 --> 02:55:57.720]  Let's go to Jerry and Louisiana.
[02:55:57.720 --> 02:56:00.720]  Well, hey, but it's Louisiana. Jerry and Louisiana, go ahead.
[02:56:00.720 --> 02:56:02.720]  Yeah, it's Indiana. Sorry, we had that problem.
[02:56:02.720 --> 02:56:04.720]  Oh, okay. Indiana, okay. Go ahead.
[02:56:04.720 --> 02:56:10.720]  But in Southern Indiana, 30 miles north of Louisville, Kentucky, there is an HIV outbreak.
[02:56:10.720 --> 02:56:22.720]  Governor Pence has already stated that it's a state of emergency for that county. Now, they've erected a brand new fence around the National Guard that you cannot see through now.
[02:56:22.720 --> 02:56:27.720]  But if you get up on top of the building, you can look in there and you can see anti personnel armament.
[02:56:27.720 --> 02:56:31.720]  They're building up with sound cannons and water hoses.
[02:56:31.720 --> 02:56:40.720]  Now, the sheriff has leaked the information out that he's been taken out of power that somebody has come in and took him away from his desk.
[02:56:40.720 --> 02:56:43.720]  Now, where is this? This is in Indiana. Tell me the city again.
[02:56:43.720 --> 02:56:46.720]  Scottsburg, Scot County, Indiana.
[02:56:46.720 --> 02:56:47.720]  Scottsburg.
[02:56:47.720 --> 02:56:53.720]  There was a story about it on AP yesterday and today the story is gone.
[02:56:53.720 --> 02:56:56.720]  So it makes me think that they're blacking out the story.
[02:56:56.720 --> 02:57:07.720]  That was on the news I've seen Friday. That's my old hometown. Well, seven miles west in a town called Maryville, there's supposedly a church Christian camp.
[02:57:07.720 --> 02:57:16.720]  But it has a 20 foot fence around it that you can't see through and they just built an airport there right inside that compound.
[02:57:16.720 --> 02:57:18.720]  They'll call it a compound because that's what it is.
[02:57:18.720 --> 02:57:26.720]  And they've created a huge concrete structure and I don't know what they're doing there, but they're digging and there's an airport.
[02:57:26.720 --> 02:57:30.720]  Now, people said that they're going to start marching the streets soon.
[02:57:30.720 --> 02:57:36.720]  It's already the CDC says the state of emergency and the governor has declared a state of emergency.
[02:57:36.720 --> 02:57:39.720]  So the people are saying that it's going to be a martial law.
[02:57:39.720 --> 02:57:43.720]  Did you say it was an HIV outbreak that they're saying?
[02:57:43.720 --> 02:57:46.720]  HIV outbreak, yes. AIDS outbreak.
[02:57:46.720 --> 02:57:51.720]  That's very unusual. That's very unusual. 29 cases this year.
[02:57:51.720 --> 02:57:58.720]  Yeah, but still, I mean, that's not the sort of thing that's going to be so easily transmissible that they would set up some kind of a quarantine area.
[02:57:58.720 --> 02:58:00.720]  Right. Right.
[02:58:00.720 --> 02:58:05.720]  It's supposedly FEMA's been going around house to house asking questions.
[02:58:05.720 --> 02:58:09.720]  You know, do you have clean needles and things like that? They shut down the needle bank.
[02:58:09.720 --> 02:58:12.720]  Okay, we got it pulled up. Indiana governor extends public health emergency.
[02:58:12.720 --> 02:58:15.720]  Yeah, we see that there. We're going to have to take a look at that.
[02:58:15.720 --> 02:58:18.720]  I'm going to point that out. I hadn't seen that. Stay with us. We're going to come back and overdrive.
[02:58:18.720 --> 02:58:47.720]  We'll try to get to Jerry, John, Omar and Daniel as quickly as well as we can. We'll be right back.
[02:58:48.720 --> 02:58:52.720]  Use since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems.
[02:58:52.720 --> 02:58:56.720]  Introducing the new infowarslife.com, oil of oregano formulation.

[02:59:23.720 --> 02:59:28.720]  to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life changing health benefits.

[02:59:45.720 --> 02:59:48.720]  That's infowarslife.com.
[02:59:50.720 --> 02:59:54.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:01.720 --> 03:00:07.720]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:07.720 --> 03:00:11.720]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[03:00:15.720 --> 03:00:18.720]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm David Knight and we're going into overdrive.
[03:00:18.720 --> 03:00:23.720]  Trying to take the callers who've been queued up here. Let's go to John in California, John.
[03:00:23.720 --> 03:00:25.720]  Hello, hi.
[03:00:25.720 --> 03:00:27.720]  Hey, go ahead, you're on.
[03:00:27.720 --> 03:00:34.720]  Yeah, Mr. Knight, I just want to say I definitely appreciate your operation, but at the same time I definitely feel that.
[03:00:34.720 --> 03:00:39.720]  Well, basically, I'll just give you a long story short. I've listened to you guys for about four or five years.
[03:00:39.720 --> 03:00:43.720]  I've been trying to make a sort of what's going on in the world. I'm 22 years old.
[03:00:43.720 --> 03:00:47.720]  I'm one of those new generation people.
[03:00:47.720 --> 03:00:51.720]  I just see my generation nowadays and it just kind of seems like nobody cares about anything.
[03:00:51.720 --> 03:00:56.720]  At the same time, I kind of understand since I'm a first generation American.
[03:00:56.720 --> 03:01:05.720]  My parents are originally from Mexico and you definitely see an obvious discrepancy when it comes to just social things,
[03:01:05.720 --> 03:01:08.720]  structural things, you know, everything's just completely different.
[03:01:08.720 --> 03:01:15.720]  So I definitely can see why they're sort of like a very arrogant and obsessed culture nowadays.
[03:01:15.720 --> 03:01:21.720]  But if anything, I would just kind of want to address generally, you know, things on just, for example, immigration.
[03:01:21.720 --> 03:01:26.720]  I definitely see that every time it's been talked about.
[03:01:26.720 --> 03:01:34.720]  It always seems like, you know, you guys sort of have the power to sort of just direct that conversation to a whole different thing.
[03:01:34.720 --> 03:01:39.720]  Because, for example, when you definitely see or you hear things like illegal immigrants,
[03:01:39.720 --> 03:01:43.720]  that definitely puts people off the whole conversation.
[03:01:43.720 --> 03:01:46.720]  Well, yeah, but that's part of that. That's the idea.
[03:01:46.720 --> 03:01:52.720]  There are people who immigrate legally who go through the process. There's a backlog of about four million people right now
[03:01:52.720 --> 03:01:55.720]  that are backlogged to try to come through the process.
[03:01:55.720 --> 03:02:00.720]  And so it's kind of like, you know, people getting upset if you're standing at a movie theater and somebody cuts ahead of you in the line.
[03:02:00.720 --> 03:02:02.720]  I mean, it's kind of that type of thing.
[03:02:02.720 --> 03:02:08.720]  We have a process. We have a limit as to how many people we can assimilate in the country at one point.
[03:02:08.720 --> 03:02:13.720]  And the real underlying problem of all this, of course, is the welfare state.
[03:02:13.720 --> 03:02:17.720]  We cannot have open immigration as long as we have an entitlement state.
[03:02:17.720 --> 03:02:23.720]  And it's essentially been recognized by social planners, Cloward and Piven,
[03:02:23.720 --> 03:02:29.720]  who put it out as a strategy to try to destroy the economy of the country so they could then rebuild it from the ashes
[03:02:29.720 --> 03:02:32.720]  into the socialist utopia that they wanted to see.
[03:02:32.720 --> 03:02:35.720]  So that's, John, what we're concerned about.
[03:02:35.720 --> 03:02:38.720]  It isn't that we have any issues with anybody from any particular country.
[03:02:38.720 --> 03:02:41.720]  And it's not just Mexicans who are coming through the central border.
[03:02:41.720 --> 03:02:45.720]  It's not just South Americans who are coming through the open southern border.
[03:02:45.720 --> 03:02:48.720]  It's people from any country can come through here.
[03:02:48.720 --> 03:02:53.720]  We have anchor babies from China, women who are coming here and having babies,
[03:02:53.720 --> 03:02:58.720]  coming here on a vacation just to have a baby from China so they can go back and then have a child
[03:02:58.720 --> 03:03:03.720]  who can then help them to come in with immigration, help them to get on a welfare state if they want.
[03:03:03.720 --> 03:03:10.720]  So that's the issue that we have with it, is that there has to be some kind of a process or has to be some kind of control with it.
[03:03:10.720 --> 03:03:13.720]  Does that make sense to you?
[03:03:13.720 --> 03:03:14.720]  I agree with that.
[03:03:14.720 --> 03:03:15.720]  I understand that.
[03:03:15.720 --> 03:03:17.720]  I know you're not attacking anybody.
[03:03:17.720 --> 03:03:18.720]  I know you're not.
[03:03:18.720 --> 03:03:22.720]  But at the same time, what I'm trying to say is that generally when you use those type of terms,
[03:03:22.720 --> 03:03:25.720]  I mean, there has to be a way where we can all just get together and just talk.
[03:03:25.720 --> 03:03:30.720]  It's the same thing of whether or not this whole globalist thing is just true because I've tried to rationalize it myself.
[03:03:30.720 --> 03:03:31.720]  I see both sides of the picture.
[03:03:31.720 --> 03:03:32.720]  I definitely see that.
[03:03:32.720 --> 03:03:36.720]  You know, you guys have some points on just overall the things that are going on,
[03:03:36.720 --> 03:03:41.720]  just this freak up outbreaks and all that, it just, you know, there has to be something to it.
[03:03:41.720 --> 03:03:46.720]  And, you know, all the operations going on like operation data, which is definitely sketchy.
[03:03:46.720 --> 03:03:51.720]  And the only way I found out about it is because you guys, so I get what you're trying to say.
[03:03:51.720 --> 03:03:54.720]  But at the same time, let's just say if this is real or not.
[03:03:54.720 --> 03:03:57.720]  Don't you kind of, that's another thing I just wanted to address.
[03:03:57.720 --> 03:04:02.720]  I don't kind of jump in here and there, but that's another thing I kind of wanted to address because let's say this is true.
[03:04:02.720 --> 03:04:07.720]  Let's say this whole new world order thing is absolutely 100% you guys are on point.
[03:04:07.720 --> 03:04:12.720]  Don't you guys, isn't there any way we can just kind of sit down and just talk about it?
[03:04:12.720 --> 03:04:18.720]  Because regardless of, for example, I've listened to people like Mr. Lou Gordowski, right from a we are change.
[03:04:18.720 --> 03:04:20.720]  And I understand, you know, I like his work too.
[03:04:20.720 --> 03:04:23.720]  He goes out there, he asks the real question to get in their face.
[03:04:23.720 --> 03:04:28.720]  At the same time, I feel like that sort of approach is sort of like, you know, it's very.
[03:04:28.720 --> 03:04:34.720]  Well, we're almost at a time, sorry to the other callers, but yeah, I did want to address that.
[03:04:34.720 --> 03:04:41.720]  The thing is, we have to understand that even when you're talking about the open borders, that is something that is really part of, you said,
[03:04:41.720 --> 03:04:44.720]  if this new world order really exists, that is part of their strategy.
[03:04:44.720 --> 03:04:47.720]  That's why Nancy Pelosi said we have two communities.
[03:04:47.720 --> 03:04:49.720]  It just happens to have a border coming through it.
[03:04:49.720 --> 03:04:50.720]  It doesn't mean anything to them.
[03:04:50.720 --> 03:04:55.720]  You have to look at what their end game is and it doesn't work out for people on either side of the border.
[03:04:55.720 --> 03:04:59.720]  That's it for today. Join us for the nightly news tonight at 7 Central.
