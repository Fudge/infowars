[00:00.000 --> 00:23.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this January 27th, 2021, Wednesday broadcast.
[00:23.000 --> 00:34.000]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and we are going to have the founder of the Boogaloo Boys joining us coming up on the broadcast today.
[00:34.000 --> 00:42.000]  That is in the second hour. I appreciate Mr. Dunn coming on after I've said some critical things of his group.
[00:42.000 --> 00:50.000]  He says to set the record straight, so I look forward to that, because who's going to know more about the Boogaloo's than the founder of the Boogaloo's?
[00:50.000 --> 00:55.000]  So I'm really looking forward to that interview coming up. Owen Schroyer is going to be riding shotgun with me here.
[00:55.000 --> 01:03.000]  He'll be here for the next three, four hours. I'll be gone in two hours while horses could not drag me away. So much important news unfolding.
[01:03.000 --> 01:09.000]  Roger Stone has been quiet the last few weeks and said that he's not ready to go on air until he has something big to say.
[01:09.000 --> 01:20.000]  Well, he texted me this morning and I called him and he is on the show with big news. I'll leave it at that at 1130 Central tomorrow.
[01:20.000 --> 01:26.000]  Roger's not been doing interviews really because he doesn't want the media lying about him.
[01:26.000 --> 01:29.000]  He's just so overwhelmed with the level of lies they tell about him.
[01:29.000 --> 01:39.000]  They're sending a SWAT team to his hotel room on the day of the capital attack that was worse than Pearl Harbor according to the Democrats.
[01:39.000 --> 01:46.000]  Of course it wasn't. It was four people being killed and the cop having a heart attack a day later, but that he's kind of off the radar.
[01:46.000 --> 01:54.000]  But Roger will make his return tomorrow. And yes, folks, they sent a SWAT team to the hotel we were staying at.
[01:54.000 --> 01:59.000]  They tried to get me to then I guess later figured out that I actually tried to stop the riot.
[01:59.000 --> 02:09.000]  But that's the level of the media's disinfo is that they sent SWAT teams for us until they later found out that we had not instigated the capital event.
[02:09.000 --> 02:17.000]  So again, Roger will be talking about the impeachment trial that starts on the eighth against President Trump.
[02:17.000 --> 02:25.000]  And there's a very, very important video posted to Band-Aut video that has the headline proof President Trump did not incite the riot.
[02:25.000 --> 02:31.000]  But I think that's not even strong enough headline. I think we're going to change it to must watch.
[02:31.000 --> 02:42.000]  Info war security team lays out what really happened at the U.S. Capitol January 6 because we've gone ahead and gotten a whole timeline together
[02:42.000 --> 02:50.000]  and broken down exactly who did what when there it is exclusive proof Trump did not incite the Capitol riot.
[02:50.000 --> 02:55.000]  And so many people moved on from Trump. They're like, well, it doesn't matter. He's out of office. Who cares if he gets in trouble?
[02:55.000 --> 03:04.000]  If they're able to hang the fraud around the president's neck that he incited this on purpose, they're able to pass this legislation
[03:04.000 --> 03:12.000]  that's five times worse. The Patriot Act against the American people where they say they're going to use the Pentagon and the CIA against American people.
[03:12.000 --> 03:17.000]  Now, that doesn't scare me. Actually, that makes me mad. And it makes me understand that I guess they want a violent revolution.
[03:17.000 --> 03:23.000]  They're probably going to get one because they're certainly have done enough to warrant a revolution.
[03:23.000 --> 03:29.000]  The problem is they're going to stage false flags against innocent targets of revolution starts to demonize us.
[03:29.000 --> 03:34.000]  And so the public isn't educated enough about the globalist threat yet and how they operate.
[03:34.000 --> 03:40.000]  Still, I think if a violent revolution did kick off in actual targets, globalists were targeted, they would roll over pretty quick.
[03:40.000 --> 03:49.000]  I'm not calling for that because I'm not God. And as much as I know, being on air for 27 years and experiencing a lot,
[03:49.000 --> 03:55.000]  I still have had my ass handed to me more than once, like the Capitol.
[03:55.000 --> 04:02.000]  Our biggest triumph, a million people peacefully so they have a 10-day investigation and then a couple hundred anti-fun others take it all away from us.
[04:02.000 --> 04:06.000]  And I should have known they would do something like that. I should have known, but I didn't.
[04:06.000 --> 04:10.000]  And so those of you out there are like, oh, it's just have a violent revolution.
[04:10.000 --> 04:18.000]  You're always the ones that are asking somebody else to do it. You're always the ones asking somebody else to do it.
[04:18.000 --> 04:26.000]  You know, take the Boogaloo's. They said, and I'm going to ask Mr. Dunn about this, that they were to have an armed march the weekend after the sixth.
[04:26.000 --> 04:32.000]  But if you have an armed march in D.C., they'll arrest you for that. You can say, well, it's my second amendment. They'll still arrest you.
[04:32.000 --> 04:39.000]  And so then we didn't see the Boogaloo's show up armed. Were they hoping? Other people would? I don't know.
[04:39.000 --> 04:45.000]  I just don't like this thing of let's have violent revolution. And then people say, OK, well, you go first.
[04:45.000 --> 04:52.000]  I'm not going first. And even if I could get somebody else to be violent, I don't want to sit back and watch that happen because I don't like playing God.
[04:52.000 --> 04:55.000]  The globalists though, we're starting it and they'll probably get what they want.
[04:55.000 --> 05:17.000]  So all of you that want a big bloody revolution, you want to get some.
[05:17.000 --> 05:28.000]  Band.video and hundreds of other URLs we've launched have been banned. That's why every month we launch a new URL before they ban it.
[05:28.000 --> 05:39.000]  But Soros and Bill Gates and the globalists are on our tail. But the new website is theresistance.video.
[05:39.000 --> 05:43.000]  They're trying to block us because the truth is powerful and can defeat them.
[05:43.000 --> 05:54.000]  So the new URL that links right to Band.video and all of our videos and all of our documentaries and all the special reports and all the suppressed information is at theresistance.video.
[05:54.000 --> 06:02.000]  Share the link. Theresistance.video. Theresistance.video.
[06:02.000 --> 06:13.000]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government coverups. You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he.
[06:13.000 --> 06:22.000]  Live from theinfowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[06:22.000 --> 06:33.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live on this Wednesday, 27th day of January, 2021, coming up in 11 days.
[06:33.000 --> 06:39.000]  The trial of the 45th president of the United States begins in the U.S. Senate.
[06:39.000 --> 06:46.000]  A impeachment in the House is only an indictment. Impeachment in the House is only an indictment.
[06:46.000 --> 07:01.000]  So what they did last year in January is nothing. What they're starting up again this January in the House that they passed last week is something because it's an actual trial for the president supposedly inciting that crowd.
[07:01.000 --> 07:13.000]  Well, I was there. I worked with five other organizations to organize legal, lawful, peaceful events with a secret service, metal detectors, and porta-potties.
[07:13.000 --> 07:18.000]  And that's what the president wanted. He said repeatedly, we're going to peacefully march. His son said that.
[07:18.000 --> 07:29.000]  And so to say that his rhetoric that isn't one-tenth as aggressive as the Democrats, burn it all down, Civil War, New York Times, Atlantic Monthly, go to their houses, get in their faces.
[07:29.000 --> 07:37.000]  Pelosi saying burning down buildings is just what people do. Their rhetoric is at least ten times what the Republican rhetoric has been.
[07:37.000 --> 07:44.000]  The idea that Republicans want to burn things down and roll things up. But regardless, this is the trial of the president.
[07:44.000 --> 07:51.000]  And I think he should be there. I think he should testify. And this is really Trump's chance to turn the tide.
[07:51.000 --> 08:00.000]  And instead of having his tail between his legs, go in there and just lay out the facts. Exhibit one. Here I am saying don't be violent. Exhibit two. Exhibit three.
[08:00.000 --> 08:08.000]  I've had hundreds and hundreds of rallies that are peaceful. Exhibit four. Here's all these Democrats, including Nancy Pelosi, calling for violence at Maxine Waters,
[08:08.000 --> 08:16.000]  and calling for killing Trump, and killing his supporters, and show a montage of Trump's supporters being attacked, because he's going to be able to show his video.
[08:16.000 --> 08:23.000]  And then, hey, call me up before the Senate in the trial. Call up the other organizations and groups that were there.
[08:23.000 --> 08:31.000]  And they'll sit there and point blank and tell you why the hell would we want to storm a Capitol and ruin everything we were doing, trying to point out that the election was fraudulent.
[08:31.000 --> 08:39.000]  Why would we want to discredit that? To make sure they ended up voting against having a 10-day investigation. It's called a motive, and the other side had the motive.
[08:39.000 --> 08:46.000]  And of course, that's why Antifun, other leftist control groups, took responsibility for breaking in, getting the police to attack the general crowd,
[08:46.000 --> 08:54.000]  then people yelled, attack, get in, and a very small percentage, not even one half of one percent. If you had a million people there in D.C.,
[08:54.000 --> 09:01.000]  a couple hundred thousand there at the Capitol, we're talking about less than one percent that actually went in there, and most of them between the velvet ropes.
[09:01.000 --> 09:10.000]  And notice it's all the velvet rope people that are being indicted. But if you actually were part of a fire team, or you were actually, you know, in there,
[09:10.000 --> 09:18.000]  oh, you're fine, you're wonderful, you're good, so we'll be discussing that more at length. But this is a big deal.
[09:18.000 --> 09:24.000]  There are a lot of people that think cutting and running from the president because he wasn't perfect, or because he didn't stop big tech censorship.
[09:24.000 --> 09:30.000]  Don't you think he gets all that now? It doesn't matter. They want to hurt him to associate it with all of us.
[09:30.000 --> 09:38.000]  He is now a symbol of America and populist resistance. And if you don't get that, you don't get anything. And all I get is persecution.
[09:38.000 --> 09:46.000]  I've been told, you know, a year ago, two years ago, come out against the Second Amendment, come out against President Trump, and all your problems will be over.
[09:46.000 --> 09:56.000]  And you'll get money. Now, those are off record meetings. I can't say who, but I'm sure people can add two plus two and know what number it comes up with.
[09:56.000 --> 10:12.000]  But I signed non-disclosures and everything. You understand? With multiple globalist power grips trying to get me to stop. And almost everybody else takes the money because they go, hey, I got a carrot and I got a stick.
[10:12.000 --> 10:18.000]  So there's all these fools that go on and go, Jones is defending Trump because he makes money off of it.
[10:18.000 --> 10:27.000]  Yeah, if you think 50 Democrat lawsuits and getting the platform, your bank accounts taken and PayPal taken away and kicked off everything. Oh, man, it's wonderful.
[10:27.000 --> 10:38.000]  It's so good to stand up for Trump. But regardless, Trump made a lot of mistakes. And now he's losing his bank accounts. He's lost his YouTube.
[10:38.000 --> 10:47.000]  He's lost over 60 other platforms so he can be silenced. Listen to this silenced ahead of and during his trial.
[10:47.000 --> 10:59.000]  And it guarantees are saying, oh, let the president's lawyers put on the defense. No. Put Trump in there. Put Trump in there on the witness seat and let them attack him and lie about him.
[10:59.000 --> 11:16.000]  And all he's got to do is have a hit list of exhibits after they attack him and he puts on and it will destroy them right out of a Perry Mason movie or right out of the real footage of the famous House Committee on American Activities.
[11:16.000 --> 11:30.000]  And then the Senate Committee on American Activities and the lawyer says, have you no decency? You know, just that point. And I mean, I could go into that Senate trial and annihilate them, annihilate them.
[11:30.000 --> 11:39.000]  This is their waterloo. But of course, they're always the aggressive globalist. We always coward of them. We always act like we're the bad guys and we're on the defense.
[11:39.000 --> 11:56.000]  The answer is offense, offense, offense, offense, offense. We have giant banking cartels that are far and owned that own big tech that are now systematically shutting down tens of millions of Americans with AI, surveilling us and censoring us as a political class.
[11:56.000 --> 12:12.000]  They're saying they want to arrest us and reeducate us in camps. They're saying they want to kill us. They're saying they want to kill the president and his family. They have paramilitary thugs beating people up the streets and shooting them in the head and burning down public housing.
[12:12.000 --> 12:25.000]  We have Joe Biden on TV saying, I don't even know what I'm signing. And then next he goes, I just banned saying China virus in the federal government. If it's in any document, it's illegal. And if you use a word, we're going to fire you.
[12:25.000 --> 12:36.000]  It's all naked insane-ness. And Fauci said, I do think it's important that we all wear two masks now. Everybody wants to take the mask off? Oh, no, no, two. Two. We got to inspect it's the right time.
[12:36.000 --> 12:48.000]  Oh, not to be outdone and make that sound reasonable. Now CNBC AP. Oh, actually, you need three masks. Just so haven't I looked that up with the different types of masks that are out there to pick on the time.
[12:48.000 --> 13:05.000]  One mask lowers your oxygen level about 20%. And oxygen is already a trace gas. Two masks lowers it even more. Three masks. I mean, hell, why not just get a noose, get a rope, put it over the rafters, put it on your neck, kick the stool, you know, jump off the stool.
[13:05.000 --> 13:16.000]  And you will not transmit COVID anymore, because your neck's going to break and you're going to fixate. You're going to die. You're going to crap your britches and they're going to come in and they're going to cut you down and they're going to go put you in the ground somewhere.
[13:16.000 --> 13:33.000]  Please don't do that. I'm not being serious. But that's the point we've reached. And again, this is too able to fail. That's really the plan here. It's all about your dirty, your bad, your evil. And now everyone I know knows someone that was old that took the COVID vaccine and died.
[13:33.000 --> 13:42.000]  John Raport's been talking about this today. He said, 10 months ago, it's about targeting the old. And remember, the British Ministry covered their ass a month and a half ago, they said, if you're over 75, don't take it.
[13:42.000 --> 13:58.000]  If you're under 16, don't take it. And if you're pregnant, don't take it. But see, does it matter? The billboards and the doctors at the NIH here and the National Health Service in England, they all say the same thing, whether it's Australia, the U.S., it's all you and run.
[13:58.000 --> 14:11.000]  They admit the U.N. gives the orders. The United Nations said that you go ahead and give it to old people first. So I'm here in Utah. I was in Salt Lake at the My Patriot Supply Facility.
[14:11.000 --> 14:22.000]  Actually, it's incredible what you see in the footage. The biggest warehouse I've ever been in. 400,000 square feet. You put a star destroyer in there. And I saw billboards all over town. If you're above 70, you get it first.
[14:22.000 --> 14:38.000]  Oh, you're the most at risk group. You're above 70. You get the vaccine first when the National Health Service in England and the National Institutes of Health here in the United States both have fine prints saying if you're above 75, don't take it.
[14:38.000 --> 14:48.000]  But the billboards, you see how that works? The fine print says don't take it. But big blue and white billboards, big flashing billboards, you need it if you're above 70, you need it, you need it.
[14:48.000 --> 14:59.000]  And I see the same damn billboards in Austin. I see the same damn billboards everywhere. You can be in Australia see the same damn billboards because it's called global government.
[14:59.000 --> 15:08.000]  Global government. So the fine print, they tell you don't take it. But oh, I'm the news they're like pregnant women need to take it so you don't get sick.
[15:08.000 --> 15:18.000]  So please if you're pregnant. And what does it do? It attacks the baby. Oh, and Shroyer's riding shotgun with me. He's got a lot to say about this and more when we come back.
[15:18.000 --> 15:29.000]  But I have the founder of the Boogaloo boys joining us in the second hour. And I really don't know what to make of this gentleman.
[15:29.000 --> 15:39.000]  The fact that he's going to be coming on the broadcast, Mike Dunn. I really look forward to having him on next hour. That should be very, very interesting.
[15:39.000 --> 15:49.000]  And then as I said earlier, Roger Stone has been silent for weeks. He'll be joining after they have physically attacked his wife or in the hospital at her house and sent us watching to his house.
[15:49.000 --> 15:57.000]  But you know, it's no big deal. Full part living in free society. But he'll be on the broadcast with us tomorrow. We'll be right back on Alex Jones in FullWars.com.
[15:57.000 --> 16:07.000]  I've got some bad news. Our best selling vitamin mineral fusion has sold out because people understand in these stressful times it's now more important than ever to boost your body's natural defenses.

[17:59.000 --> 18:13.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:13.000 --> 18:16.000]  Here's an important quote.
[18:16.000 --> 18:21.000]  Welcome back. I'm your host Alex Jones coming to you from Utah in the beautiful mountains.
[18:21.000 --> 18:29.000]  The good Lord created. I'll enjoy this back in the ATX. Let me read to you this quote from Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1963 letter from Birmingham jail.
[18:29.000 --> 18:33.000]  The freedom is never given voluntarily, especially a requote of Frederick Douglass.
[18:33.000 --> 18:41.000]  Freedom is never given voluntarily by the oppressor. It must be demanded by the oppressed. You must demand it for it will not be given freely.
[18:41.000 --> 18:46.000]  Okay, also believe that liberty most often comes to those who petition for it peacefully.
[18:46.000 --> 18:53.000]  There's a lion meets the lamb dichotomy to the struggle peacefully achieve freedom is not safe from threat.
[18:53.000 --> 18:58.000]  It must and fiercely be defended as if it were ardently attained.
[18:58.000 --> 19:06.000]  But because of peace upon that which the freedom is built is integrity is unassailable.
[19:06.000 --> 19:08.000]  So it's integrity is unassailable.
[19:08.000 --> 19:20.000]  And that's why the globalists don't want a velvet revolution where we just say no to them and freedom is so much obviously better than America so much more better than globalism that we just rejected.
[19:20.000 --> 19:27.000]  They want to accelerate us into a physical conflict because they believe they can kill our free society and submit their takeover that way.
[19:27.000 --> 19:37.000]  That's why they're going to lead paramilitary groups that are either knowingly controlled or unknowingly controlled because of their low IQs into hitting targets that are not good targets.
[19:37.000 --> 19:40.000]  I mean, let me tell you, I'm not saying kill anybody. Okay.
[19:40.000 --> 19:50.000]  But, you know, the globalists coming at us with these deadly vaccines that they know are meant to the populace, the super unpopular top globalist Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates.
[19:50.000 --> 19:56.000]  Notice you never see anybody actually going after the people above Biden, above Trump.
[19:56.000 --> 20:01.000]  There's all the secret service from the president to make you think they actually run things.
[20:01.000 --> 20:07.000]  That's why they hated Trump. With Trump, the first time since Ronald Reagan, we had a guy that was actually president.
[20:07.000 --> 20:10.000]  By the way, I've interviewed people that worked with Reagan very closely.
[20:10.000 --> 20:12.000]  It's in the memoirs. Nancy Reagan talked about it.
[20:12.000 --> 20:15.000]  Reagan was the president for about a year until they shot him.
[20:15.000 --> 20:22.000]  Then they gave him cold blood, caused brain damage. They drugged him up a bunch. He really never bounced back from that.
[20:22.000 --> 20:24.000]  Okay.
[20:24.000 --> 20:27.000]  Ronald Reagan sounded like Alex Jones before Alex Jones was around.
[20:27.000 --> 20:32.000]  He talked about the New World Order, the trilateral commission, the globalist. He learned a lot from Barry Goldwater.
[20:32.000 --> 20:36.000]  And he was not going along with the stuff that George Herbert Walker Bush wanted.
[20:36.000 --> 20:41.000]  So they had him shot. And they had dinner with Hinckley's brother two nights before in Denver, Colorado.
[20:41.000 --> 20:45.000]  That's in the Denver Post. And so it's in his dad with CIA.
[20:45.000 --> 20:51.000]  And so they literally, you know, took one for the team and had their probably MK Ultra son.
[20:51.000 --> 20:57.000]  That's a big thing to see how I did most of them to their kids. And so that's what they did. And they sent that person in.
[20:57.000 --> 21:05.000]  So that's a fact, ladies and gentlemen. So we haven't had somebody that was president since about 1981.
[21:05.000 --> 21:11.000]  It's been a globalist operation. And Trump got in because it was such a landslide. He had another big landslide.
[21:11.000 --> 21:16.000]  And they are trying to repudiate that landslide. And he is now our real president in exile.
[21:16.000 --> 21:20.000]  And I'm glad he set up this office of the former president. I mean, they all do that, but he's officially doing it.
[21:20.000 --> 21:26.000]  And so all of you again, and most of you aren't doing this, but all of you that are getting off on screw him, he could have done this better.
[21:26.000 --> 21:29.000]  He could have done that better. I'm going to explain something.
[21:29.000 --> 21:37.000]  If we let them hang Trump out to dry, do you think we're going to get other presidents that are willing to do this, other congressmen that are willing to do this, other senators, other governors?
[21:37.000 --> 21:46.000]  If you turn and run and don't support Trump now because he wasn't perfect, it sends a message to the next Bolsonaro or the next whoever it is,
[21:46.000 --> 21:52.000]  that if you do this, you get destroyed. That's the message to me. Jones, you either join us or you're destroyed.
[21:52.000 --> 21:59.000]  Well, I can't sign on to this Satanism. If the globalists weren't corrupt and bad and they were better than our system, I would adopt it and, you know, I would adopt it.
[21:59.000 --> 22:04.000]  I wouldn't sell out to it. I am not adopting their evil system. So I'm going to explain this again.
[22:04.000 --> 22:10.000]  People are like, why are you still supporting that piece of trash Trump? If they're able to destroy Trump, they're going to destroy everybody else.
[22:10.000 --> 22:12.000]  Just like I told you three years ago when they banned me everywhere.
[22:12.000 --> 22:19.000]  I said, if Trump doesn't do this, by the election, they're going to steal it. They're going to have an internet kill switch for all conservatives that's selective through their AI.
[22:19.000 --> 22:26.000]  Exactly that's been done. Go back to the last Joe Rogan interview four days before the election, four days before the election.
[22:26.000 --> 22:30.000]  He said, what's going to happen? I said, Trump's going to win in a landslide and then they're going to steal it.
[22:30.000 --> 22:41.000]  And then Trump's going to contest it and it's going to go to the Supreme Court and I believe the Supreme Court will betray him and they did and they did and they did.
[22:41.000 --> 22:50.000]  And then I saw the Supreme Court reshuffle justices over the appeals courts to accelerate the cases unlike November 8th or whatever.
[22:50.000 --> 23:00.000]  And I thought, oh, wow. Oh, maybe this means they're going to accelerate it because they know it's fraud. No, they accelerated it so they could kill all hope and shoot it down.
[23:00.000 --> 23:06.000]  So you're not the only ones that have false hope sometimes and then it gets dashed. I don't have all the answers.
[23:06.000 --> 23:11.000]  Oh, Troyer, what an epic time to be alive and you're going to be hosting the fourth hour of the third hour.
[23:11.000 --> 23:16.000]  You're also going to be hosting your own war room program that's really exploding in popularity three to six p.m.
[23:16.000 --> 23:25.000]  But there's so much to discuss. There's so much to talk about. I've got a John Bowne report dealing with the left claiming that we conservatives worship them and want to be them.
[23:25.000 --> 23:30.000]  It's very powerful and it really is total inversion of reality. But what else is on your radar today?
[23:30.000 --> 23:35.000]  I know you're looking forward to riding shotgun with me when we talk to the founder of the Boogaloo's.
[23:35.000 --> 23:39.000]  Well, we've got the Democrats making moves just like we thought they would, Alex.
[23:39.000 --> 23:45.000]  They're talking about packing the Supreme Court. They're talking about adding DC as a state.
[23:45.000 --> 23:50.000]  You remember, Obama said 57 states, which I guess was a misspeak at the time.
[23:50.000 --> 23:53.000]  Well, Puerto Rico, Guam, they want 57.
[23:53.000 --> 23:56.000]  Yeah, he was obviously just letting the cat out of the bag. So that's all coming on.
[23:56.000 --> 24:02.000]  They wanted to declare a climate emergency. But all kinds of different news, the triple mass, quadruple mass, put one on your ass.
[24:02.000 --> 24:07.000]  You know, it's all ridiculous. But, you know, the one thing Alex, you mentioned about the office of the former president,
[24:07.000 --> 24:18.000]  it is ceremoniously done in the past. But I think that the reason why this is so significant is because this is going to be the first one that actually has any impact.
[24:18.000 --> 24:22.000]  Nobody really cares about what Obama has to say anymore. People can pretend they do.
[24:22.000 --> 24:25.000]  They really don't. His wife has a podcast. Nobody listens. Obama goes on.
[24:25.000 --> 24:32.000]  Trump does a YouTube video, gets 5 million views. Biden does one. It gets 5,000 and 98% downvotes.
[24:32.000 --> 24:37.000]  So that's why Trump can't have any platform because we can't see that he's more popular times 100 than Biden.
[24:37.000 --> 24:41.000]  That's why everybody must see, here's the deal, guys. They don't just censor you so you can't talk.
[24:41.000 --> 24:45.000]  They censor you so they can speak for you and say what you said.
[24:45.000 --> 24:50.000]  This is so sick. He's on trial and he doesn't have a voice. And we're just going to put up with that crap.
[24:50.000 --> 24:51.000]  Sorry, I'm ranting.
[24:51.000 --> 24:58.000]  Well, and Alex, I mean, it's the old psychological thing with humans where you want to be on the winning team.
[24:58.000 --> 25:02.000]  So people don't see the censorship. They don't know Trump is censored. They just see, oh, Trump isn't anywhere.
[25:02.000 --> 25:05.000]  I just see Biden everywhere. Hollywood says Biden. So Biden must be popular.
[25:05.000 --> 25:09.000]  No, Trump is 5,000 more times popular than Biden. It's not even close.
[25:09.000 --> 25:15.000]  So now, whenever President Trump speaks out of his office of the former president, really Trump is still the president.
[25:15.000 --> 25:19.000]  He was elected president. So it's going to have the same impact as a president would have.
[25:19.000 --> 25:27.000]  And in practice, Alex, it may even be the same because, remember, he was trying to make things happen from the White House and nobody would obey.
[25:27.000 --> 25:33.000]  Nobody would do what he said. So he's basically going to have the same power of the bully pulpit out of Mar-a-Lago that he had in the White House.
[25:33.000 --> 25:38.000]  Exactly. And Trump needs to realize that. And we need to get that message to Trump.
[25:38.000 --> 25:40.000]  And we are getting that message to him that he needs to go on the offense.
[25:40.000 --> 25:45.000]  He needs to demand to face his accusers. He needs to demand to be in that Senate trial.
[25:45.000 --> 25:49.000]  He needs to make it three weeks long, a month long, suck all the oxygen out of Biden.
[25:49.000 --> 25:53.000]  And I hate to even say all this on air, but this is the advice I've actually gotten to the president. I'll leave it at that.
[25:53.000 --> 25:59.000]  He needs to just demand because, I mean, in a real trial, he could have a two-month trial.
[25:59.000 --> 26:07.000]  And Trump just needs to dominate, suck all the air out of Biden, and he can literally turn this whole thing around against him if he doesn't abide that he's been defeated.
[26:07.000 --> 26:14.000]  And I can tell you, he doesn't feel defeated, but he just feels totally sick of it and pissed off that this was allowed to happen.
[26:14.000 --> 26:18.000]  And I'm telling you, Trump needs to go on the offense. They're telling him behind the scenes. This is on record.
[26:18.000 --> 26:22.000]  That if he shuts up and goes along and rolls over, they're going to leave him alone. No, they're not.
[26:22.000 --> 26:25.000]  The only way they leave him alone is when they're defeated.
[26:25.000 --> 26:31.000]  Well, and I'm just wondering again what they're going to do. I mean, Biden couldn't even, Biden versus the pen yesterday.
[26:31.000 --> 26:36.000]  I don't know if you saw that. So Biden is slipping fast, Alex, slipping fast.
[26:36.000 --> 26:42.000]  Absolutely. Let's go to break and come back and show. Let's do Biden and the pen last segment of this hour.
[26:42.000 --> 26:45.000]  Plus, I know something special is coming up with you in last segment of this hour.
[26:45.000 --> 26:52.000]  You you you're going to put it to the test with a oxygen reader and show people what it's like to wear three masks.
[26:52.000 --> 26:55.000]  I mean, my God, this is literally killing people now.
[26:55.000 --> 26:59.000]  That's true. Dictionary has a very simple definition of terrorism.
[26:59.000 --> 27:09.000]  Other dictionaries have somewhere else. Terrorism is the threat of force or actually carrying out force for a political or financial reason.
[27:09.000 --> 27:13.000]  It's basically scaring the hell out of people until you submit to them.
[27:13.000 --> 27:17.000]  That's exactly what all this overblown COVID-19 garbage is.
[27:17.000 --> 27:21.000]  You see the headlines from CNN, ABC News, doctors say it's worse than they ever thought.
[27:21.000 --> 27:24.000]  COVID more devastating than you'd ever imagine.
[27:24.000 --> 27:30.000]  They told us that two and a half million people would be dead just eight months ago within three months.
[27:30.000 --> 27:33.000]  OK, it's a quarter million.
[27:33.000 --> 27:38.000]  If you count all of the people that died of other things, we're talking 96 percent had comorbidity.
[27:38.000 --> 27:40.000]  These are real numbers. These are real facts.
[27:40.000 --> 27:42.000]  This is the chicken little event.
[27:42.000 --> 27:45.000]  We all run our houses, never come out and are taught we're not essential.
[27:45.000 --> 27:48.000]  All the big box stores in Amazon take over the planet.
[27:48.000 --> 27:50.000]  You could stand up against it.
[27:50.000 --> 27:55.000]  This is slavery. It is not something you could put up with and survive.
[27:58.000 --> 28:00.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've studied history.
[28:00.000 --> 28:02.000]  I've interviewed all the experts.
[28:02.000 --> 28:04.000]  I have looked at every facet of this.
[28:04.000 --> 28:10.000]  And now, the only days until the inauguration of the CHICOM agent, it's all coming into place.
[28:10.000 --> 28:12.000]  That's how they change the subject from election fraud.
[28:12.000 --> 28:14.000]  It's how they change the subject from Hunter's laptop.
[28:14.000 --> 28:21.000]  It's how they change the subject from Epstein and Obama and Al Qaeda and the New World Order.
[28:21.000 --> 28:25.000]  And now use the already martial law in place for COVID-19.
[28:25.000 --> 28:30.000]  And that's what it is, to then be expanded and become political and become permanent.
[28:30.000 --> 28:33.000]  They train you to stay in your houses. They train you to be tracked.
[28:33.000 --> 28:36.000]  They train you to do what you're told for nine, ten months as training wheels.
[28:36.000 --> 28:38.000]  And now they launch the storm.
[28:38.000 --> 28:40.000]  The storm is evil.
[28:40.000 --> 28:42.000]  It's a globalist storm.
[28:42.000 --> 28:44.000]  There's not going to be martial law for Trump.
[28:44.000 --> 28:46.000]  There's going to be martial law for the globalist.
[28:46.000 --> 28:49.000]  They're trying to set you up. Don't be involved in violence.
[28:49.000 --> 28:53.000]  Expose the New World Order and expose the takeover with information.
[28:53.000 --> 28:56.000]  That's how we beat these people with truth.
[28:56.000 --> 29:05.000]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy and overall wellness.
[29:05.000 --> 29:11.000]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date.
[29:11.000 --> 29:13.000]  Super male vitality.
[29:13.000 --> 29:22.000]  Specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality in males.
[29:22.000 --> 29:27.000]  This unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses.
[29:27.000 --> 29:33.000]  And it contains no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[29:33.000 --> 29:34.000]  Yes.
[29:34.000 --> 29:38.000]  We're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology.
[29:38.000 --> 29:45.000]  Working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[29:45.000 --> 29:46.000]  So what are you waiting for?
[29:46.000 --> 29:48.000]  Go to the InfoWars store.
[29:48.000 --> 29:51.000]  Never been a better time than right now.
[29:51.000 --> 29:58.000]  Super male vitality at InfoWarsStore.com.
[29:58.000 --> 30:03.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[30:03.000 --> 30:10.000]  Now we have a really big crowd boy news that's going to be breaking next segment.
[30:10.000 --> 30:12.000]  But I'll get to it then.
[30:12.000 --> 30:17.000]  I want to cover this very important topic right here.
[30:17.000 --> 30:21.000]  crashing the lines and disinformation.
[30:21.000 --> 30:24.000]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[30:24.000 --> 30:27.000]  All right, we've got some really big, proud boy news
[30:27.000 --> 30:29.000]  that's going to be breaking next segment,
[30:29.000 --> 30:30.000]  but I'll get to it then.
[30:30.000 --> 30:35.000]  I want to cover this very important topic right now.
[30:35.000 --> 30:37.000]  The left is not created.
[30:37.000 --> 30:39.000]  The left-hand path is destructive.
[30:39.000 --> 30:42.000]  And if you go back to ancient secret societies
[30:42.000 --> 30:43.000]  over 4,000 years ago,
[30:43.000 --> 30:45.000]  when we first read about the left-hand path
[30:45.000 --> 30:47.000]  in Egyptian hieroglyphs,
[30:47.000 --> 30:50.000]  the left-hand path is seen as the sinister
[30:50.000 --> 30:53.000]  or the destructive or the not trustworthy
[30:53.000 --> 30:55.000]  and also the hidden,
[30:55.000 --> 30:57.000]  because you expect the knife to come from the right hand,
[30:57.000 --> 30:59.000]  not from the left hand.
[30:59.000 --> 31:01.000]  So the left hand is associated with bad luck.
[31:01.000 --> 31:03.000]  The list just goes on and on.
[31:03.000 --> 31:05.000]  And then you have the Jacobins
[31:05.000 --> 31:08.000]  who obviously then took over France
[31:08.000 --> 31:10.000]  and killed hundreds of thousands of people.
[31:10.000 --> 31:12.000]  They weren't going after the elite, actually.
[31:12.000 --> 31:14.000]  They were going after the middle class, the farmers,
[31:14.000 --> 31:16.000]  and some of the smaller landowners,
[31:16.000 --> 31:18.000]  because they actually wanted to set up a society
[31:18.000 --> 31:21.000]  where there were no more families based on Satanism.
[31:21.000 --> 31:24.000]  And now you'll notice the young Turks have changed their name
[31:24.000 --> 31:27.000]  to the Jacobins.
[31:27.000 --> 31:29.000]  Young Turks were another revolutionary group
[31:29.000 --> 31:31.000]  that killed a million and a half Armenian Christians.
[31:31.000 --> 31:33.000]  And so when you see all of this,
[31:33.000 --> 31:36.000]  you now see books and articles out in New Yorker Magazine
[31:36.000 --> 31:39.000]  and things about the Jacobin Revolution is here.
[31:39.000 --> 31:41.000]  We are Jacobins.
[31:41.000 --> 31:44.000]  And remember, nobody told you about Jacobins but me.
[31:44.000 --> 31:46.000]  And Lord Monkton, because he's a historian.
[31:46.000 --> 31:48.000]  And I'm not bragging. I'm saying if you don't know
[31:48.000 --> 31:50.000]  who you're up against, you don't have any hope.
[31:50.000 --> 31:54.000]  This is a 4,000-year-old Egyptian death cult secret society.
[31:54.000 --> 31:56.000]  Okay, that's where all this crap comes from.
[31:56.000 --> 31:59.000]  It's while the rappers show you all the Egyptian stuff.
[31:59.000 --> 32:01.000]  They're not actually in the secret society.
[32:01.000 --> 32:04.000]  They just know that's where the power's at.
[32:04.000 --> 32:06.000]  But you get to the highest levels of the globalist.
[32:06.000 --> 32:10.000]  Look at Epstein's Island, all that Egyptian temple stuff,
[32:10.000 --> 32:13.000]  Egyptian gods. That's what this is, okay?
[32:13.000 --> 32:15.000]  Now, why do I mention that?
[32:15.000 --> 32:18.000]  Joy Reid came out. We're going to play this very special report,
[32:18.000 --> 32:20.000]  and we'll put it up on screen for TV viewers
[32:20.000 --> 32:22.000]  so they can see the title.
[32:22.000 --> 32:25.000]  Nobody is jealous of the left's culture of death.
[32:25.000 --> 32:28.000]  She and other Democrats in this tape say,
[32:28.000 --> 32:32.000]  in this compilation, in the John Bound section of Band-Aught Video,
[32:32.000 --> 32:35.000]  that we are jealous of their culture,
[32:35.000 --> 32:37.000]  of their beauty, of how incredible they are,
[32:37.000 --> 32:39.000]  and that we're jealous of minorities.
[32:39.000 --> 32:41.000]  So why people aren't just racist and evil?
[32:41.000 --> 32:44.000]  They're jealous of black people.
[32:44.000 --> 32:47.000]  I mean, this is just the most racist, bizarre, crazy stuff,
[32:47.000 --> 32:50.000]  but the left is actually jealous of Americana culture.
[32:50.000 --> 32:54.000]  The left is jealous of not controlling Christian culture.
[32:54.000 --> 32:57.000]  The left wants to control the sex of your children.
[32:57.000 --> 33:01.000]  They own a relationship to talk about how your child should think sexually
[33:01.000 --> 33:04.000]  before you ever even talk to them on their age five.
[33:04.000 --> 33:06.000]  These are sick, evil control freaks
[33:06.000 --> 33:09.000]  that represent the satanic order that wants to play God
[33:09.000 --> 33:12.000]  and wants to take over the very genetic code,
[33:12.000 --> 33:16.000]  again, back to Egypt, of the twin serpents, the double helix.
[33:16.000 --> 33:21.000]  So they were given very advanced knowledge by the bad guy, the fallen one,
[33:21.000 --> 33:23.000]  and that's what they believe they're carrying out.
[33:23.000 --> 33:26.000]  You can see they've built this to a certain point now
[33:26.000 --> 33:29.000]  to basically finish their mission of depopulation.
[33:29.000 --> 33:31.000]  So, no joy.
[33:31.000 --> 33:34.000]  We are not enamored with you.
[33:34.000 --> 33:36.000]  That's why Hollywood's ratings are down about half.
[33:36.000 --> 33:39.000]  Once you took the NFL over, ratings are down about half.
[33:39.000 --> 33:42.000]  Everything you touch, people run from, the NBA,
[33:42.000 --> 33:46.000]  all of the blue cities and blue states, everyone's racing out of them.
[33:46.000 --> 33:49.000]  The blue states and blue cities under the UN are doing the global lockdown.
[33:49.000 --> 33:51.000]  You are the plague. You are the curse.
[33:51.000 --> 33:54.000]  We are not envying you. Here is the John Bowne Report.
[33:54.000 --> 33:58.000]  Pigs in a blanket's a crime like bacon lie about black lives matter
[33:58.000 --> 34:02.000]  has been galling me since the people on the right started throwing it out there.
[34:02.000 --> 34:06.000]  Kelly, why is the president calling black lives matter a symbol of hate?
[34:06.000 --> 34:11.000]  Well, what the president was noting is that that symbol,
[34:11.000 --> 34:15.000]  when you look at some of the things that have been chanted by black lives matter,
[34:15.000 --> 34:17.000]  like pigs in a blanket, crime like bacon,
[34:17.000 --> 34:21.000]  that's not an acceptable phrase to paint on our streets.
[34:21.000 --> 34:26.000]  There is absolutely zero, none, zero evidence that black lives matter
[34:26.000 --> 34:31.000]  has ever pushed for anything violent, pushed for anything violent to happen to police.
[34:31.000 --> 34:34.000]  Pigs in a blanket's a crime like bacon.
[34:34.000 --> 34:37.000]  What some may find offensive is also free speech.
[34:37.000 --> 34:42.000]  What's ironic here is that marchers were being protected by the very officers
[34:42.000 --> 34:44.000]  targeted in the chant.
[34:44.000 --> 34:46.000]  Statements and chants like that are just ignorant.
[34:46.000 --> 34:49.000]  You know, I find it absolutely disgusting.
[34:55.000 --> 35:00.000]  As arrogant and jaded as the left's premier conspiracy theorist is,
[35:00.000 --> 35:06.000]  Joy Reid has haphazardly brought up a major issue that has been pushed into the background
[35:06.000 --> 35:10.000]  due to the paralysis of the state of American culture.
[35:10.000 --> 35:15.000]  Jack and company have now permanently suspended Trump's Twitter account,
[35:15.000 --> 35:21.000]  finally accomplishing something three wives, multiple legal people who are suing him,
[35:21.000 --> 35:24.000]  and his entire White House staff have failed to do.
[35:24.000 --> 35:27.000]  Shutting him the hell up.
[35:27.000 --> 35:34.000]  Proving that we no longer live in a free country where any topic is fair game for criticism
[35:34.000 --> 35:36.000]  protected by our First Amendment.
[35:36.000 --> 35:42.000]  But even more dangerous is that Reid's arrogant claims are marinated in the progressive opinion
[35:42.000 --> 35:46.000]  that American culture is split in half.
[35:46.000 --> 35:51.000]  President Biden seems to understand that right-wing radicalization is a real problem.
[35:51.000 --> 35:56.000]  His team seems to recognize how Fox and Facebook and QAnon fantasies and all of that
[35:56.000 --> 36:00.000]  has caused the separate realities in the United States.
[36:00.000 --> 36:04.000]  He said in his inaugural address that he understands many of his fellow Americans
[36:04.000 --> 36:07.000]  view the future with fear and trepidation.
[36:07.000 --> 36:11.000]  And again, that's partly because of all the nonsense that's heard every night in prime time over there.
[36:11.000 --> 36:14.000]  Unity is impossible, okay?
[36:14.000 --> 36:20.000]  The United States is living in this parallel, there's parallel universes within the United States.
[36:20.000 --> 36:23.000]  Unity is not feasible. It's just not.
[36:23.000 --> 36:31.000]  This growing schism celebrated by the pundits of neoliberal social influence is a cancerous phenomenon
[36:31.000 --> 36:35.000]  that intends to accelerate the Balkanization of America.
[36:35.000 --> 36:40.000]  Well, 75% of Republicans agree with you because they were fed a big lie by President Trump
[36:40.000 --> 36:42.000]  and his supporters who say the election was stolen.
[36:42.000 --> 36:46.000]  Why can't you say President Biden won a legitimate fair election?
[36:46.000 --> 36:52.000]  Hey, George, George, where you make a mistake is that people coming from the liberal side like you,
[36:52.000 --> 36:56.000]  you immediately say everything's a lie, instead of saying there are two sides to everything.
[36:56.000 --> 37:00.000]  Historically, what would happen is if I said that I thought there was fraud,
[37:00.000 --> 37:02.000]  you would interview someone else who said there wasn't.
[37:02.000 --> 37:07.000]  But now you insert yourself in the middle and say the absolute fact is that everything I'm saying is a lie.
[37:07.000 --> 37:10.000]  Well, because, Senator, I said what the President said was a lie because he said,
[37:10.000 --> 37:14.000]  hold on a second, he said the election was stolen, this election was not stolen.
[37:14.000 --> 37:19.000]  The results were certified in every single state after counts and recounts.
[37:19.000 --> 37:23.000]  You're saying that absolutely it was, you're saying there was no fraud and it's all been investigated
[37:23.000 --> 37:24.000]  and that's just not true.
[37:24.000 --> 37:28.000]  It's not what I said, sir, I said the Department of Justice found no evidence.
[37:28.000 --> 37:29.000]  Let me finish my point.
[37:29.000 --> 37:30.000]  But you said it was all a lie.
[37:30.000 --> 37:31.000]  You said it was not true.
[37:31.000 --> 37:32.000]  You say we're all liars.
[37:32.000 --> 37:34.000]  You're just simply saying we're all liars.
[37:34.000 --> 37:36.000]  I said it was a lie that the election was stolen.
[37:36.000 --> 37:38.000]  I'm just saying that you're right and we're wrong.
[37:38.000 --> 37:41.000]  Well, no, let's talk about the specifics of it.
[37:41.000 --> 37:47.000]  In Wisconsin, tens of thousands of absentee votes had only the name on them and no address.
[37:47.000 --> 37:50.000]  Historically, those were thrown out this time they weren't.
[37:50.000 --> 37:55.000]  They made special accommodations because they said, oh, it's a pandemic and people forgot what their address was.
[37:55.000 --> 37:58.000]  So they changed the law after the fact that is wrong.
[37:58.000 --> 38:03.000]  That's unconstitutional and I plan on spending the next two years going around state to state
[38:03.000 --> 38:08.000]  and fixing these problems and I won't be cowed by liberals in the media who say,
[38:08.000 --> 38:11.000]  there's no evidence here and you're a liar if you talk about election fraud.
[38:11.000 --> 38:13.000]  No, let's have an open debate.
[38:13.000 --> 38:14.000]  It's a free country.
[38:14.000 --> 38:20.000]  Adding to Reid's absurdity is her assumption that the supposed and imagined boogeyman
[38:20.000 --> 38:27.000]  she describes as the right is jealous of the far more talented and accomplished left.
[38:27.000 --> 38:34.000]  The thing the right hates the most about Democrats is that Democrats have the culture.
[38:34.000 --> 38:36.000]  Democrats have the culture.
[38:36.000 --> 38:38.000]  They have the Hollywood culture.
[38:38.000 --> 38:42.000]  They have the glamorous culture and the right hates that.
[38:42.000 --> 38:44.000]  They feel that the culture is too woke.
[38:44.000 --> 38:46.000]  It's too multi cultural.
[38:46.000 --> 38:48.000]  It's not John Wayne anymore.
[38:48.000 --> 38:53.000]  There's all of this multiculturalism and wokeness and liberalism and they hate it,
[38:53.000 --> 38:55.000]  but they also envy it.
[38:55.000 --> 39:00.000]  They also wish they had it and they hate the fact that after Ronald Reagan,
[39:00.000 --> 39:02.000]  they no longer have a claim to the culture.
[39:02.000 --> 39:04.000]  They want the culture more than they want the politics.
[39:04.000 --> 39:06.000]  So they say we want them.
[39:06.000 --> 39:13.000]  They've largely become a voice for the left's globalist totalitarian narrative of humanity's demise
[39:13.000 --> 39:15.000]  via predictive programming.
[39:15.000 --> 39:23.000]  A once shining inventive industry of American exceptionalism has become a tortured adult shell of its former self,
[39:23.000 --> 39:29.000]  inhabited by self serving plastic egomaniacs with a fraction of the talent.
[39:29.000 --> 39:31.000]  Alright folks, this is one of John Bown's longer reports.
[39:31.000 --> 39:33.000]  The full report is at man.video.
[39:33.000 --> 39:34.000]  It really needs to get out.
[39:34.000 --> 39:36.000]  Nobody is jealous of the left's culture of death.
[39:36.000 --> 39:38.000]  The last few minutes are really powerful. I hope you'll share it.
[39:38.000 --> 39:40.000]  Alright, coming up.
[39:40.000 --> 39:44.000]  Well, it's being reported Proud Boys leader was prolific and former for law enforcement.
[39:44.000 --> 39:46.000]  I'm telling you, almost all these groups are led by feds.
[39:46.000 --> 39:48.000]  Well, they're right back. Stay with us.
[39:56.000 --> 39:58.000]  We have the technocrats are controlling the food supply.
[39:58.000 --> 40:01.000]  Secure your own safe source of food supply sale.
[40:01.000 --> 40:05.000]  It's the new prices of 2021, but it's the lowest price for high quality food.
[40:05.000 --> 40:07.000]  You're going to find at infowarstore.com.
[40:07.000 --> 40:09.000]  The subsection is prepared with alex.com.
[40:09.000 --> 40:11.000]  And it's all these globalists do this.
[40:11.000 --> 40:13.000]  And as they hoard the food and as they prepare,
[40:13.000 --> 40:17.000]  you need to understand that you need 25 year foods to rely on the last 25 years.
[40:17.000 --> 40:20.000]  One month, three months, six months, one year supplies.
[40:20.000 --> 40:22.000]  And it's the highest quality you're going to find.
[40:22.000 --> 40:25.000]  And it's just good to have that check box taken care of.
[40:25.000 --> 40:27.000]  And you know, you're getting good food at a very good price.
[40:27.000 --> 40:32.000]  And you know that a small percentage of it because there's not much profit in this goes to us to fund our operation.
[40:32.000 --> 40:36.000]  So prepare with alex.com or infowarstore.com.
[40:36.000 --> 40:39.000]  You can find the preparedness section there, water filtration, air filtration.
[40:39.000 --> 40:40.000]  It's all there.
[40:40.000 --> 40:43.000]  The technocrats are getting ready to bring in all the forced GMO and more.
[40:43.000 --> 40:44.000]  It's time to start getting prepared.
[40:44.000 --> 40:46.000]  It starts with self-defense.
[40:46.000 --> 40:47.000]  It starts with being prepared.
[40:47.000 --> 40:48.000]  It starts with horrible food.
[40:48.000 --> 40:51.000]  It starts with digging in with a long globalist fight.
[40:51.000 --> 40:58.000]  The one in the end.
[41:22.000 --> 41:23.000]  It's here.
[41:23.000 --> 41:30.000]  And only gets worse like being fed into a wood chipper or a meat grinder until you reject it all.
[41:30.000 --> 41:37.000]  And the rejection starts with realizing it's spiritual battle, the first evil and stopping abortion.
[41:37.000 --> 41:39.000]  We must start valuing human life again.
[41:39.000 --> 41:46.000]  We must start saying that we are not expendable, that we are not disposable, that we are essential.
[41:46.000 --> 41:49.000]  Until we do that, we are all slaves.
[41:49.000 --> 41:56.000]  We stand up and declare our basic God-given human rights now.
[42:20.000 --> 42:25.000]  Now a limited supply is back in stock, 25% off at infowarstore.com.
[42:25.000 --> 42:29.000]  Pollen block again is available in this one minute ad.
[42:29.000 --> 42:34.000]  I don't have time to tell you all about it, but believe me, I have really wanted it back in because it works naturally.
[42:34.000 --> 42:40.000]  Unlike some of the stuff that's over the counter that makes you all be speedy and irritable and gives you a headache.
[42:40.000 --> 42:41.000]  This is naturally occurring.
[42:41.000 --> 42:48.000]  It's the secret of how the quail don't have the seasonal distress and it's passed on somehow through their eggs to us.
[42:48.000 --> 42:53.000]  You chew up the pills, they taste great, it's available again, infowarstore.com.
[42:53.000 --> 43:21.000]  Pollen block, infowarstore.com.
[43:21.000 --> 43:24.000]  Well, you might want to find out what Agenda 2030 is.
[43:24.000 --> 43:27.000]  It is the destruction of society as we know it.
[43:27.000 --> 43:29.000]  It is making the population war.
[43:29.000 --> 43:35.000]  By designs, we can be controlled with a medical technocracy over you and your family.
[43:35.000 --> 43:40.000]  They're destroying civilization, rebuilding in their dystopic image.
[43:40.000 --> 43:44.000]  We are fighting this at infowarstore.com and newswarstore.com.
[43:44.000 --> 43:51.000]  We are fighting for a pro-human future and we need you to get the facts, to research it and share it with others and join the fight.
[43:51.000 --> 43:52.000]  God bless you.
[43:52.000 --> 43:57.000]  Visit us, spread the word, at infowars.com.
[43:57.000 --> 44:10.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[44:10.000 --> 44:17.000]  Welcome back. I am your host, Alex Jones, coming to you from the beautiful mountains of Utah.
[44:17.000 --> 44:19.000]  And we have Owen Schroder back in the ATX in Austin.
[44:19.000 --> 44:20.000]  Big announcements.
[44:20.000 --> 44:21.000]  Hey, did you hear?
[44:21.000 --> 44:33.000]  Merck has pulled its two vaccines because of major health problems and bad reactions, both are mRNA vaccine and their regular vaccine that had a bizarre measles delivery system.
[44:33.000 --> 44:40.000]  Those have been pulled and they say it doesn't work and it's dangerous and you shouldn't take a vaccine because they know the house of cards is coming down.
[44:40.000 --> 44:45.000]  We also have all these deaths of 20-year-olds, 50-year-olds, 75-year-olds, 80-year-olds.
[44:45.000 --> 44:47.000]  It goes on and on and on.
[44:47.000 --> 44:53.000]  But don't worry, Fauci told you 2.4 million Americans would be dead within the first three months last year.
[44:53.000 --> 44:54.000]  I remember he said that in March.
[44:54.000 --> 44:57.000]  He said within three months, there'll be 2.4 million dead.
[44:57.000 --> 44:59.000]  Other models had 2.5 million, 2.2 million.
[44:59.000 --> 45:05.000]  All funded by Bill Gates, the British model, the German model, and the U.S. model, all funded by the same guy.
[45:05.000 --> 45:08.000]  You wonder why Bill Gates declares, you'll never be unlocked down.
[45:08.000 --> 45:09.000]  You'll never shake hands.
[45:09.000 --> 45:10.000]  You'll never stop wearing masks.
[45:10.000 --> 45:12.000]  You're like, why is this guy in charge?
[45:12.000 --> 45:20.000]  Because he heads up the major eugenics board that controls everything and he's back in the news today saying people are being so mean to him.
[45:20.000 --> 45:25.000]  And he doesn't know why they think there's a plan to put microchips in you to make sure you've been vaccinated.
[45:25.000 --> 45:37.000]  I mean, we only have MIT and Rice University saying in documentaries from two years ago that Bill Gates is funding nanotech in the vaccines to prove that you've had the vaccine.
[45:37.000 --> 45:39.000]  But again, it doesn't matter.
[45:39.000 --> 45:44.000]  It's kind of like what Paul Watson pointed out yesterday when he hosted the fourth hour did a splendid job.
[45:44.000 --> 45:56.000]  You have Klaus Schwab announcing Great Reset, World Government, New World Order, all of this, and saying COVID's not really a threat, but we're using this to cut the carbon footprint and bring in a technocracy to save the Earth.
[45:56.000 --> 45:59.000]  The New York Times says the Great Reset doesn't exist.
[45:59.000 --> 46:03.000]  It's like telling your four-year-old, they go, where'd Grandma go?
[46:03.000 --> 46:05.000]  Oh, she went on to a better place.
[46:05.000 --> 46:06.000]  Well, what's dead?
[46:06.000 --> 46:07.000]  Well, don't worry about that right now.
[46:07.000 --> 46:09.000]  Death doesn't exist.
[46:09.000 --> 46:11.000]  Like, where'd the goldfish go?
[46:11.000 --> 46:18.000]  Well, Spot or Orange or Fluffy, whatever the fish's name is, Fluffy's gone to heaven.
[46:18.000 --> 46:21.000]  No Fluffy got flushed down the toilet.
[46:21.000 --> 46:27.000]  So they talk to you like you're idiots and we can never have a real debate about what's going on.
[46:27.000 --> 46:31.000]  So they put flora in the water for decades, knowing it lowered your IQ and lower fertility.
[46:31.000 --> 46:34.000]  Now, Harvard studies admit that, but still they put it in your water.
[46:34.000 --> 46:40.000]  It's all about waging world general populations stunning you, dumbing you down so they can control you and control the future.
[46:40.000 --> 46:43.000]  It's about selfishness. It's about playing God.
[46:43.000 --> 46:47.000]  So they have now announced that it's not enough to kill Hank Aaron.
[46:47.000 --> 46:51.000]  Now they want everyone to wear two masks, Fauci said yesterday.
[46:51.000 --> 46:55.000]  So to make him look reasonable, CNBC and others said, no, no, no, no, no.
[46:55.000 --> 46:56.000]  We need three masks.
[46:56.000 --> 46:58.000]  Some are saying four masks.
[46:58.000 --> 47:01.000]  Only four masks are saying is 99% effective.
[47:01.000 --> 47:08.000]  So they're now admitting that even the so-called surgical mask and all the rest of it don't protect you.
[47:08.000 --> 47:11.000]  Of course, they don't because the virus is small and goes right through it.
[47:11.000 --> 47:12.000]  What helps you is nutrition.
[47:12.000 --> 47:16.000]  Turns out, rendezvous is 100% effective.
[47:16.000 --> 47:18.000]  That's what the media doesn't want it.
[47:18.000 --> 47:21.000]  There's so many things that are 100% effective, ladies and gentlemen.
[47:21.000 --> 47:26.000]  But if you don't have vitamin D, you'll 100% die within about six months, but they want you to stay ignorant.
[47:26.000 --> 47:28.000]  So they've announced the daily COVID briefings are back.
[47:28.000 --> 47:30.000]  It's not going away.
[47:30.000 --> 47:33.000]  It's going to get worse because Bill Gates said it would.
[47:33.000 --> 47:40.000]  And so we now take you to Owen Troyer, a dirty human that needs to cover his face in public, needs to cover his dirtiness.
[47:40.000 --> 47:42.000]  He's a bad person.
[47:42.000 --> 47:47.000]  All the real studies show that when you are around other people with germs, you share the germs, you have a better immunity.
[47:47.000 --> 47:49.000]  No, I want to see him on camera.
[47:49.000 --> 47:51.000]  Show me the dirty human right now.
[47:51.000 --> 47:52.000]  Zoom in on him.
[47:52.000 --> 47:53.000]  Close shot.
[47:53.000 --> 47:57.000]  I want people to see a dirty, evil human.
[47:57.000 --> 47:58.000]  Do we not have a close shot?
[47:58.000 --> 47:59.000]  I asked for one.
[47:59.000 --> 48:04.000]  I need a close shot on this filthy, dirty scumbag.
[48:04.000 --> 48:05.000]  More.
[48:05.000 --> 48:06.000]  More.
[48:06.000 --> 48:09.000]  Look at him not covering his face, letting disease come out.
[48:09.000 --> 48:15.000]  Well, if he gets with a woman and gets married, he might create more of these damn things and eat up the resources of our globalist planet.
[48:15.000 --> 48:18.000]  So Owen, Fauci says wear two masks.
[48:18.000 --> 48:25.000]  I know that one mask lowers oxygen 15 to 20% and increases carbon dioxide or carbon, I guess carbon dioxide and monoxide.
[48:25.000 --> 48:26.000]  That's already a trace gas.
[48:26.000 --> 48:29.000]  I want to see you, you filth bag.
[48:29.000 --> 48:30.000]  Put on your mask.
[48:30.000 --> 48:31.000]  Okay.
[48:31.000 --> 48:37.000]  Now at first admit everybody, you apologize for being human and that you admit your scum and you're going to submit.
[48:37.000 --> 48:38.000]  All right.
[48:38.000 --> 48:39.000]  I'm sorry.
[48:39.000 --> 48:44.000]  I'm a dirty, I'm a dirty human and I can spread asymptomatically diseases that I don't have.
[48:44.000 --> 48:45.000]  And I'm sorry for being.
[48:45.000 --> 48:47.000]  Oh, did you hear about that more?
[48:47.000 --> 48:50.000]  Oh, there's the Brazilian and the UK strain.
[48:50.000 --> 48:51.000]  Have you heard?
[48:51.000 --> 48:52.000]  Are you scared of that?
[48:52.000 --> 48:53.000]  Yeah.
[48:53.000 --> 49:01.000]  I said, I should be really scared that it's even more deadly that it might, you might only have a 99.8 survival rate with this strain.
[49:01.000 --> 49:04.000]  So if you're about 85, yeah, if you're younger, you can't die from it.
[49:04.000 --> 49:05.000]  Absolutely.
[49:05.000 --> 49:07.000]  So, so right now put on the first mask.
[49:07.000 --> 49:08.000]  Let's breathe oil.
[49:08.000 --> 49:10.000]  Take a reading of carbon dioxide first.
[49:10.000 --> 49:15.000]  Now take the reading to show people the reading first while you're openly dirty breathing, dirty human.
[49:15.000 --> 49:17.000]  Let's let's get a breathing.
[49:17.000 --> 49:19.000]  I'm in studio all day.
[49:19.000 --> 49:20.000]  All right.
[49:20.000 --> 49:21.000]  It hasn't gone off.
[49:21.000 --> 49:28.000]  I've been going on somewhere between 580 and 620 here parts per million there with the carbon dioxide.
[49:28.000 --> 49:30.000]  But you know what?
[49:30.000 --> 49:32.000]  I'm going to have to increase those levels.
[49:32.000 --> 49:34.000]  I've been told it's good for me by the global government.
[49:34.000 --> 49:35.000]  That's right.
[49:35.000 --> 49:39.000]  So you put on your mask and then we'll take a reading.
[49:39.000 --> 49:42.000]  You want me to how many should I wear boss?
[49:42.000 --> 49:48.000]  Well, just breathe for a while and then and then yeah, yeah, let's put on.
[49:48.000 --> 49:54.000]  Let's let's stick that sensor underneath that, that, that, that ugly face covering you.
[49:54.000 --> 49:56.000]  You're your little burka.
[49:56.000 --> 49:58.000]  No, you suddenly be under Islam.
[49:58.000 --> 49:59.000]  Did you?
[49:59.000 --> 50:05.000]  All right, I've got you dirty filthy American cover that dirty piehole face of yours.
[50:05.000 --> 50:07.000]  All right, I've got one mask on right now, Alex.
[50:07.000 --> 50:12.000]  And I'm trying to get it airtight so I don't get any of the covid's and don't worry.
[50:12.000 --> 50:15.000]  Don't worry about this meter if it starts to go up.
[50:15.000 --> 50:17.000]  Oh, there it goes.
[50:17.000 --> 50:19.000]  Oh, carbon dioxide's going way up.
[50:19.000 --> 50:20.000]  Danger.
[50:20.000 --> 50:21.000]  Danger.
[50:21.000 --> 50:23.000]  Well, that's all right.
[50:23.000 --> 50:26.000]  At least I'm stopping covid though, Alex.
[50:26.000 --> 50:28.000]  Hey, but not to mention.
[50:28.000 --> 50:30.000]  Oh, and it gets better.
[50:30.000 --> 50:34.000]  Not to mention you also cause this massive bacterial pneumonia.
[50:34.000 --> 50:36.000]  And they admit that's causing more death.
[50:36.000 --> 50:37.000]  But that's okay.
[50:37.000 --> 50:38.000]  Okay.
[50:38.000 --> 50:40.000]  So it's already dropped a bunch.
[50:40.000 --> 50:41.000]  Now let's not out now.
[50:41.000 --> 50:43.000]  Now one is not enough.
[50:43.000 --> 50:45.000]  We need inspections of this.
[50:45.000 --> 50:47.000]  The China is the model.
[50:47.000 --> 50:48.000]  They're the heroes.
[50:48.000 --> 50:54.000]  They've announced now checkpoints with anal probes where they're now going to do anal probes and vans to test to see if you have covid.
[50:54.000 --> 50:56.000]  They say that the PCR test isn't valid.
[50:56.000 --> 50:57.000]  Oh, really?
[50:57.000 --> 50:58.000]  We already knew that.
[50:58.000 --> 51:03.000]  So, oh, and so we're going to have mask checkpoints are now announcing the UK and anal probes.
[51:03.000 --> 51:04.000]  We've got to do what Gigi Ping does.
[51:04.000 --> 51:05.000]  We've got to humiliate you better.
[51:05.000 --> 51:06.000]  That's two masks now.
[51:06.000 --> 51:07.000]  Is that two masks?
[51:07.000 --> 51:08.000]  Yeah, I've got two masks on.
[51:08.000 --> 51:09.000]  Do you want me to get it?
[51:09.000 --> 51:10.000]  I can go more, Alex.
[51:10.000 --> 51:13.000]  Yeah, I guess it's picking up so much carbon dioxide right now.
[51:13.000 --> 51:14.000]  It's going up for us even by your face.
[51:14.000 --> 51:16.000]  Yeah, go ahead and put it back under there.
[51:16.000 --> 51:17.000]  How much has it dropped?
[51:17.000 --> 51:18.000]  Okay.
[51:18.000 --> 51:20.000]  Oh, an infowars mask.
[51:20.000 --> 51:21.000]  Here, let's go.
[51:21.000 --> 51:22.000]  You've got to wear one.
[51:22.000 --> 51:23.000]  We'll fight back.
[51:23.000 --> 51:26.000]  I can reset it if you want or we can put it back under.
[51:26.000 --> 51:28.000]  Well, how much did it drop?
[51:28.000 --> 51:30.000]  It's still dropping now.
[51:30.000 --> 51:33.000]  It got up to almost 5,000 parts per million.
[51:33.000 --> 51:35.000]  It's slowly dropping right now.
[51:35.000 --> 51:37.000]  Well, let's just stick it back up under there.
[51:37.000 --> 51:38.000]  That's three masks.
[51:38.000 --> 51:42.000]  Owen is now doing what CNBC says you should do.
[51:42.000 --> 51:43.000]  Three masks.
[51:43.000 --> 51:45.000]  Put it back underneath the ugly pie hole.
[51:45.000 --> 51:48.000]  Stick it under there, the covering with the dirty hole.
[51:48.000 --> 51:49.000]  Cover up that.
[51:49.000 --> 51:51.000]  It's like a big gaping.
[51:51.000 --> 51:53.000]  You know what they call those.
[51:53.000 --> 51:55.000]  Cover up that filthy rat hole.
[51:55.000 --> 51:57.000]  You filthy dirty American.
[51:57.000 --> 51:58.000]  All right.
[51:58.000 --> 51:59.000]  Okay, good.
[51:59.000 --> 52:03.000]  Now let's hear about all that brain damaging carbon dioxide you're breathing.
[52:03.000 --> 52:05.000]  All right, here we go.
[52:05.000 --> 52:06.000]  You dirty carbon unit.
[52:06.000 --> 52:08.000]  We got to cut all carbon, including all humans.
[52:08.000 --> 52:09.000]  But I'm stopping.
[52:09.000 --> 52:11.000]  Look at that carbon dioxide surging.
[52:11.000 --> 52:12.000]  Oxygen plummeting.
[52:12.000 --> 52:14.000]  Yes, we have brain damage.
[52:14.000 --> 52:15.000]  Victory.
[52:15.000 --> 52:18.000]  God, there's nothing they won't submit to.
[52:18.000 --> 52:20.000]  America's eyes.
[52:20.000 --> 52:23.000]  God, GGP is in control.
[52:23.000 --> 52:27.000]  That's a dangerous level of carbon dioxide I see there.
[52:27.000 --> 52:29.000]  Owen, give us the reading.
[52:29.000 --> 52:31.000]  Yeah, it's actually about to go off the charts.
[52:31.000 --> 52:37.000]  It looks like here, Alex, this thing doesn't go higher than 9,999 parts per million.
[52:37.000 --> 52:39.000]  So I think we're about to go off the meter here, Alex.
[52:39.000 --> 52:40.000]  Yep, there it goes.
[52:40.000 --> 52:42.000]  So we're about to go, how are you feeling?
[52:42.000 --> 52:45.000]  Do you feel like you're being suffocated?
[52:45.000 --> 52:46.000]  Yeah, I can.
[52:46.000 --> 52:52.000]  Godfather to Godfather to smothering scenes type and Godfather to smothering scene or
[52:52.000 --> 52:54.000]  Godfather to assassins.
[52:54.000 --> 52:55.000]  I don't know.
[52:55.000 --> 52:56.000]  The guys put the pillow.
[52:56.000 --> 53:02.000]  Yeah, I mean, this is probably how Steve or excuse me, how the judge Scalia felt in
[53:02.000 --> 53:05.000]  his last moments, I would imagine, but.
[53:05.000 --> 53:06.000]  Or Jeffrey Epstein.
[53:06.000 --> 53:08.000]  I really cannot breathe in right now.
[53:08.000 --> 53:09.000]  I mean, it's like, I don't care.
[53:09.000 --> 53:10.000]  You're a terrorist.
[53:10.000 --> 53:12.000]  You're going to wear at least three.
[53:12.000 --> 53:13.000]  Let's go further.
[53:13.000 --> 53:14.000]  Put a fourth one on.
[53:14.000 --> 53:18.000]  Do it or you're a terrorist or say they want to charge people with terrorism that don't
[53:18.000 --> 53:21.000]  wear more, more, more, more.
[53:21.000 --> 53:24.000]  We ought to just pour like glue down your throat.
[53:24.000 --> 53:26.000]  Why don't you just kill yourself?
[53:26.000 --> 53:27.000]  So you don't spread COVID.
[53:27.000 --> 53:28.000]  You dirty human.
[53:28.000 --> 53:29.000]  How's that feel?
[53:29.000 --> 53:33.000]  I think if I wear this long enough, Alex, you'll probably snuff me out.
[53:33.000 --> 53:34.000]  Okay.
[53:34.000 --> 53:35.000]  Well, that doesn't matter.
[53:35.000 --> 53:36.000]  Terrorists, these are good for you.
[53:36.000 --> 53:37.000]  Put on a fifth one right now.
[53:37.000 --> 53:40.000]  You damn terrorist.
[53:40.000 --> 53:45.000]  No, that's Godfather woman.
[53:45.000 --> 53:47.000]  That's good for him too.
[53:47.000 --> 53:48.000]  He did that to stop COVID.
[53:48.000 --> 53:49.000]  No, no, no.
[53:49.000 --> 53:50.000]  Show the pillow scene.
[53:50.000 --> 53:53.000]  It's good for you.
[53:53.000 --> 53:54.000]  More.
[53:54.000 --> 53:58.000]  Don't even put the censor under there.
[53:58.000 --> 53:59.000]  You dirty American.
[53:59.000 --> 54:02.000]  Radio listeners were at info wars.com.
[54:02.000 --> 54:06.000]  More, more, more.
[54:06.000 --> 54:07.000]  More.
[54:07.000 --> 54:08.000]  More.
[54:08.000 --> 54:09.000]  More.
[54:09.000 --> 54:10.000]  You're dirty.
[54:10.000 --> 54:11.000]  More.
[54:11.000 --> 54:14.000]  You're going to kill me.
[54:14.000 --> 54:15.000]  No, keep going.
[54:15.000 --> 54:17.000]  This doesn't hurt you to breathe more carbon dioxide.
[54:17.000 --> 54:19.000]  It doesn't hurt you to take poison vaccines.
[54:19.000 --> 54:20.000]  It doesn't hurt you to take fluoride.
[54:20.000 --> 54:22.000]  It doesn't GMOs good for you.
[54:22.000 --> 54:23.000]  Five C's good for you.
[54:23.000 --> 54:24.000]  More.
[54:24.000 --> 54:25.000]  I can't breathe.
[54:25.000 --> 54:28.000]  Listen, you're fired if you don't put 10 more on you dirty.
[54:28.000 --> 54:29.000]  Submit now.
[54:29.000 --> 54:30.000]  You're a terrorist.
[54:30.000 --> 54:31.000]  I can't even breathe.
[54:31.000 --> 54:32.000]  Yes, more.
[54:32.000 --> 54:33.000]  Get a news.
[54:33.000 --> 54:34.000]  Hang in killing.
[54:34.000 --> 54:37.000]  I think I'm going to die like this.
[54:37.000 --> 54:40.000]  Now you're covered up like an Islamic woman in Saudi Arabia.
[54:40.000 --> 54:41.000]  Good.
[54:41.000 --> 54:44.000]  We'll be right back with hour number two with the boogaloo's.
[54:44.000 --> 54:45.000]  Hey, Alex.
[54:45.000 --> 54:46.000]  How you doing, man?
[54:46.000 --> 54:49.000]  Is this the guy that called in about living defense?
[54:49.000 --> 54:50.000]  Yes, sir.
[54:50.000 --> 54:51.000]  Yes, sir.
[54:51.000 --> 54:55.700]  I've been trying to get a hold of you since Monday when I heard you got that fresh shipment
[54:55.700 --> 54:58.000]  of living defense in from Utah.
[54:58.000 --> 55:02.000]  I said, man, I got to get on that show and give him an update.
[55:02.000 --> 55:07.000]  I said, if I ever get a chance to be on the Alex Jones show, I'm going to tell the world
[55:07.000 --> 55:10.000]  about living defense and what it did for me personally.
[55:10.000 --> 55:16.000]  Now look, I'm 64 years old going on 20 thanks to this info for store products.
[55:16.000 --> 55:20.000]  And by the way, I bought $800 worth the other night.
[55:20.000 --> 55:22.000]  So I'm doing what I can, brother.
[55:22.000 --> 55:27.000]  So what my, my contention is, why don't we start this new year off right with everybody
[55:27.000 --> 55:29.000]  getting a couple bottles of living defense?
[55:29.000 --> 55:32.000]  Now you got to follow that up with the microsdx.
[55:32.000 --> 55:34.000]  I learned that.
[55:34.000 --> 55:36.000]  So it's like God working is so amazing.
[55:36.000 --> 55:37.000]  We didn't know.
[55:37.000 --> 55:38.000]  We didn't screen your call.
[55:38.000 --> 55:39.000]  We had no idea.
[55:39.000 --> 55:43.000]  And I go to you a year later and you're here telling people about living defense, living
[55:43.000 --> 56:10.000]  defense, living defense.
[56:13.000 --> 56:17.000]  It's all being announced.
[56:17.000 --> 56:22.000]  They are literally taking over the life cycle of humans and making us obsolete and big corporations
[56:22.000 --> 56:27.000]  downplay that they own us with these gene therapy systems and patents that they produced.
[56:27.000 --> 56:28.000]  Do you understand?
[56:28.000 --> 56:31.000]  It is a takeover of the entire species of the genetic level.
[56:31.000 --> 56:35.000]  And now they're coming with dog collars and they're announcing in public schools in the
[56:35.000 --> 56:37.000]  U.S. starting next year.
[56:37.000 --> 56:38.000]  It will begin.
[56:38.000 --> 56:39.000]  Did you hear me?
[56:39.000 --> 56:43.000]  Dog collars for your children all based on a hoax, all based on a lie.
[56:43.000 --> 56:49.000]  Info wars continue to spread the word to fight back.
[56:49.000 --> 57:01.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[57:01.000 --> 57:04.000]  All right.
[57:04.000 --> 57:05.000]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[57:05.000 --> 57:11.000]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and if you just joined us, Owen, the dirty human Troyer is
[57:11.000 --> 57:12.000]  a bad carbon unit.
[57:12.000 --> 57:13.000]  All carbon is bad.
[57:13.000 --> 57:14.000]  Trees, plants, humans.
[57:14.000 --> 57:16.000]  We've got a tax that we've got to control.
[57:16.000 --> 57:18.000]  We've got to transcend the humans.
[57:18.000 --> 57:20.000]  Well, I wonder who runs these globalists.
[57:20.000 --> 57:21.000]  I mean, I'm not into UFOs and stuff.
[57:21.000 --> 57:24.000]  I just can think in a logical, linear way.
[57:24.000 --> 57:25.000]  They want to get rid of humans.
[57:25.000 --> 57:27.000]  They say the post-human world's here.
[57:27.000 --> 57:31.000]  The Bible says it's a fallen creature on the planet doing this to us.
[57:31.000 --> 57:35.000]  Whatever, maybe we're pre-programmed to kill ourselves, I don't know, but Owen Troyer,
[57:35.000 --> 57:37.000]  let's go back to you.
[57:37.000 --> 57:39.000]  When I wear one mask, I have trouble breathing.
[57:39.000 --> 57:41.000]  When I wear two, I try to suffocate him.
[57:41.000 --> 57:43.000]  What was it like to wear six masks?
[57:43.000 --> 57:47.000]  You legitimately look like you were panicking there a little bit, buddy, which I couldn't
[57:47.000 --> 57:51.000]  even do what you just did.
[57:51.000 --> 57:56.000]  I mean, honestly, I mean, you wear the one mask, you can still kind of get some air flow,
[57:56.000 --> 58:00.000]  but once you put on the second and the third, I mean, it's like you're sucking in.
[58:00.000 --> 58:01.000]  I mean, I don't know.
[58:01.000 --> 58:04.000]  It's like a vacuum that's like clogged or something.
[58:04.000 --> 58:07.000]  It's like, you can't, I mean, they're really, you have to really effort.
[58:07.000 --> 58:10.000]  It's like, I guess it would be like having, you know, asthma.
[58:10.000 --> 58:13.000]  They say, if you want to know what it's like to have asthma, you suck air through a straw.
[58:13.000 --> 58:15.000]  You know, it's tough to breathe.
[58:15.000 --> 58:16.000]  So it's kind of like that.
[58:16.000 --> 58:19.000]  And it's like the Nexium Colton, all this makes people wear masking gags.
[58:19.000 --> 58:23.000]  They're all into being suffocated, like, like, like Carrotty and all of them.
[58:23.000 --> 58:25.000]  Literally, this is a cult ritual, isn't it?
[58:25.000 --> 58:28.000]  No, I can't understand how people do this.
[58:28.000 --> 58:31.000]  I mean, I think that, you know, quite frankly, I'm so lucky.
[58:31.000 --> 58:34.000]  I mean, we're working one of the last great American companies here at Info Wars.
[58:34.000 --> 58:37.000]  We can still live free, have a gun, be mask free.
[58:37.000 --> 58:41.000]  And I guess, you know, it's like, we can't even, I can't even relate.
[58:41.000 --> 58:46.000]  I mean, people sit there and for eight hours, they'll wear a face mask for eight hours.
[58:46.000 --> 58:48.000]  And it's the, and they have to wear the mask.
[58:48.000 --> 58:51.000]  They don't let them wear the handkerchief or whatever.
[58:51.000 --> 58:52.000]  It's the mask.
[58:52.000 --> 58:54.000]  And also, you know, I'm wondering too.
[58:54.000 --> 58:59.000]  It's also a cast thing because I like being doing tours of factories or other people's facilities.
[58:59.000 --> 59:02.000]  And like, none of the owners or CEOs are wearing them and everybody else is.
[59:02.000 --> 59:05.000]  It's like a, it's literally a cast thing.
[59:05.000 --> 59:08.000]  Well, it is, and that's why you see Biden and his family going to the Lincoln Memorial,
[59:08.000 --> 59:11.000]  not wearing masks hours after he signs the executive order saying,
[59:11.000 --> 59:14.000]  you must wear, you must wear a mask on federal property.
[59:14.000 --> 59:16.000]  By the way, did you see the press secretary?
[59:16.000 --> 59:19.000]  We ought to play that letter after the Boogaloo Commander comes on.
[59:19.000 --> 59:21.000]  The Boogaloo Lord, I'm sorry.
[59:21.000 --> 59:26.000]  What's her name? Sushi? That's her last name, Redhead Sushi.
[59:26.000 --> 59:28.000]  She says, well, that's not serious.
[59:28.000 --> 59:30.000]  Let's talk about important things.
[59:30.000 --> 59:34.000]  So him having an order that you got to wear a mask illegally, that's important.
[59:34.000 --> 59:36.000]  But when he does, he's important.
[59:36.000 --> 59:38.000]  She's telling you, oh, he's important.
[59:38.000 --> 59:40.000]  He doesn't wear a damn mask.
[59:40.000 --> 59:44.000]  And you can even find, I mean, again, the healthcare workers, people at grocery stores,
[59:44.000 --> 59:47.000]  wherever they're wearing the mask, eight straight hours,
[59:47.000 --> 59:53.000]  they are having like breakouts and like eczema and like disease and all of this stuff.
[59:53.000 --> 59:55.000]  This is like a Pac-Man hand going on here.
[59:55.000 --> 59:57.000]  That's like the globalist, though.
[59:57.000 --> 59:59.000]  They're like the Pac-Man just eating up all of our freedoms,
[59:59.000 --> 1:00:01.000]  just yow, yow, yow, yow, yow, yow, yow, yow, yow, yow, yow.
[1:00:01.000 --> 1:00:03.000]  Just eating any freedom they can take.
[1:00:03.000 --> 1:00:04.000]  Yow, yow, yow, yow, yow, yow, yow.
[1:00:04.000 --> 1:00:06.000]  And so they don't even want you to breathe, Alex.
[1:00:06.000 --> 1:00:08.000]  They're going to say breathing is illegal.
[1:00:08.000 --> 1:00:11.000]  You used to go on air 20 years ago and people probably thought you were crazy.
[1:00:11.000 --> 1:00:13.000]  Oh, they're going to say there's more than two genders.
[1:00:13.000 --> 1:00:18.000]  They're going to make man and woman and dad and mom illegal to say they're going to stop you
[1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:19.000]  from even breathing.
[1:00:19.000 --> 1:00:21.000]  And that's where we've gotten to this point.
[1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:24.000]  In fact, Alex, if you want to play the clip, I had the crew grab it.
[1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:25.000]  We can play it back to back.
[1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:28.000]  Fauci on 60 minutes saying no point wearing a mask.
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:29.000]  It doesn't do anything.
[1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:30.000]  Don't wear the mask.
[1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:32.000]  Now he says, oh, wear three masks to stop COVID.
[1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:34.000]  Here it is.
[1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:36.000]  Right now, people should not be walked.
[1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:38.000]  There's no reason to be walking around with a mask.
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:41.000]  When you're in the middle of an outbreak,
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:45.000]  wearing a mask might make people feel a little bit better.
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:48.000]  And it might even block a droplet.
[1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:53.000]  But it's not providing the perfect protection that people think that it is.
[1:00:53.000 --> 1:00:57.000]  And often there are unintended consequences.
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:01:00.000]  People keep fiddling with the mask and they keep touching their face.
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:03.000]  And can you get some schmutz sort of staying inside there?
[1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:04.000]  Of course.
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  Of course.
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:12.000]  I think masks you should think of health care providers needing them.
[1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  Oh, now it's common sense.
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:18.000]  It's common sense to wear two masks, he says now.
[1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:21.000]  And also, you could pass it by farting.
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  So does Fauci have a giant butt plug?
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:26.000]  It makes common sense that it likely would be more effective.
[1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:30.000]  And that's the reason why you see people either double masking or doing a version.
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  Alex, he wears the butt plug, not for reasons to stop COVID.
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:37.000]  Well, Snopes should check that claim.
[1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  M4's claims that Dr. Fauci has a butt plug the size of a fire hydrant to stop COVID.
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:46.000]  And if you don't put a giant butt plug in, I'm serious, you are helping spread COVID.
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  So we need to know, I mean, China's coming with anal testing.
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:50.000]  Now it's going to be here.
[1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:52.000]  I'm not even joking.
[1:01:55.000 --> 1:01:59.000]  President Trump won in a landslide on November 3rd.
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:02.000]  But the globalists weren't going to let that happen.
[1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  They had to have some way to repudiate the populist movement,
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:12.000]  emanating from the United States, and it spread across the world, from the UK to Brazil.
[1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:13.000]  They were desperate.
[1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:14.000]  They admitted their own publications.
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:16.000]  They didn't know what to do.
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:23.000]  And so they put out 80 million fake ballots, violated state law, and stole it better than Dallas.
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:27.000]  And now they're coming after the president, they're coming after you, they're coming after me.
[1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:29.000]  They're shutting everybody off the internet.
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:31.000]  They're trying to totally censor us.
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:35.000]  And that's why M4 Wars is still in the fight, because we knew this was coming.
[1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:36.000]  We told you this was coming.
[1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  We were the first main target that we're still on air at m4wars.com and doiswars.com and band up with you.
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:46.000]  Without your word of mouth, without your prayer, without your financial support, we can't stay on air.
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:51.000]  So while you still can, go to m4warstore.com and get storeable foods and high quality products,
[1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:58.000]  supplements, you name it, at m4wars.com.
[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  I was born to bring trouble to wherever I'm at.
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  Got the number 13 tattooed on my neck.
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:45.000]  When the ink starts to itch, then the black will turn to red.
[1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:52.000]  So we go back to 1775 at Lexington and Concord where the war started.
[1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:55.000]  The British had already been tearing up their printing presses.
[1:03:55.000 --> 1:03:59.000]  They've been confiscating guns and ammo all over Boston.
[1:03:59.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  And the captain of the local militia said, we don't want a war.
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:04.000]  We don't want to fight.
[1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  And we should not shoot first.
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:09.000]  But if they want a war, they're going to get one.
[1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:10.000]  And you know what happened?
[1:04:10.000 --> 1:04:12.000]  They ended up shooting him and killing him and the war started.
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:17.000]  And the British, a large part of their force got killed trying to get back to where they came from
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:18.000]  and the rest is history.
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:21.000]  And it looked like we lost the first five years of the war.
[1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  But by perseverance, we ended up winning in the end.
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:29.000]  So resistance, when you're on the right, is victory.
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:30.000]  That's an Alex Jones quote.
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:32.000]  Resistance is victory.
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:34.000]  And laying down is slavery.
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:38.000]  I think those are easy, galactic, common law things.
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  And so I believe the Declaration of Independence.
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:44.000]  I believe that when we have a destructive government that has come after our freedoms and our rights
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:48.000]  and that has proven itself to be an authoritarian force that isn't going away,
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:49.000]  it's not just our right.
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:53.000]  It's our duty to throw off such a force.
[1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:54.000]  But I don't want to stupidly do it.
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:04:56.000]  I don't want to be led by the ADL, the Southern Probable Law Center.
[1:04:56.000 --> 1:04:58.000]  I don't want to be led by idiots.
[1:04:58.000 --> 1:05:01.000]  I don't want to go at the wrong targets.
[1:05:01.000 --> 1:05:06.000]  And I want to exhaust every form of unofficial warfare,
[1:05:06.000 --> 1:05:11.000]  because war is just politics by other means, as von Bismarck said.
[1:05:11.000 --> 1:05:13.000]  The pen is mire and sword.
[1:05:13.000 --> 1:05:18.000]  And so I'm not very good at war if I can't win with the pen.
[1:05:18.000 --> 1:05:20.000]  And so I'm really trying to do that.
[1:05:20.000 --> 1:05:22.000]  And I'll assure you, I'm not looking for war,
[1:05:22.000 --> 1:05:25.000]  but if war ever came and river roll ahead to heaven,
[1:05:25.000 --> 1:05:29.000]  I would prosecute as hard as I do the shove with my full intent.
[1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:32.000]  But we have the truth and justice on our side.
[1:05:32.000 --> 1:05:34.000]  And if Martin Luther King could do what he did,
[1:05:34.000 --> 1:05:36.000]  not McGonagy or Jesus Christ, their example,
[1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:39.000]  shouldn't we follow that example as long as we can?
[1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:41.000]  Now, Mike Dunn, I appreciate him coming on.
[1:05:41.000 --> 1:05:44.000]  Usually people we disagree with are cowards that don't come on.
[1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:46.000]  So it gets high marks coming on.
[1:05:46.000 --> 1:05:48.000]  And Mike Dunn is a well-known boogaloo boy.
[1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:50.000]  They call him the leader of the founder,
[1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:52.000]  constitutional adherent, 20-year-old,
[1:05:52.000 --> 1:05:55.000]  former Trump supporter, turned libertarian.
[1:05:55.000 --> 1:05:57.000]  I guess he was in the Marines, too, as well.
[1:05:57.000 --> 1:05:59.000]  And so I'm going to try to give him the floor of the rest of the segment.
[1:05:59.000 --> 1:06:00.000]  We've got about seven minutes left.
[1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:02.000]  And then I've got my questions and my comments.
[1:06:02.000 --> 1:06:04.000]  We're going to set a straight.
[1:06:04.000 --> 1:06:06.000]  We're all about folks that want to set a straight.
[1:06:06.000 --> 1:06:08.000]  And if I'm wrong, I will apologize.
[1:06:08.000 --> 1:06:10.000]  So Mike, thanks for coming on.
[1:06:10.000 --> 1:06:11.000]  Thank you, Alex.
[1:06:11.000 --> 1:06:13.000]  First things first, I'm not the leader of the boogaloo.
[1:06:13.000 --> 1:06:15.000]  I'm not the founder. It's an autonomous movement.
[1:06:15.000 --> 1:06:18.000]  I'm just someone who's in the movement who helped make it big
[1:06:18.000 --> 1:06:20.000]  and the media line might have a public face.
[1:06:20.000 --> 1:06:24.000]  And I happen to control a large portion of the movement.
[1:06:24.000 --> 1:06:26.000]  So I just wanted to get that straight.
[1:06:26.000 --> 1:06:29.000]  The movement was not founded by me and I'm not the leader of it.
[1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:32.000]  I'm not a prominent figure in it.
[1:06:32.000 --> 1:06:35.000]  To start with, Alex, you started with a quote.
[1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:37.000]  I want to address that as well.
[1:06:37.000 --> 1:06:39.000]  From yourself, here's some other quotes from you.
[1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:42.000]  1776 is the answer to 1984.
[1:06:42.000 --> 1:06:46.000]  You also said if just 5% of people got motivated in some direction,
[1:06:46.000 --> 1:06:48.000]  and it doesn't have to be what I believe in,
[1:06:48.000 --> 1:06:52.000]  but if they got motivated and stopped getting their political ideologies
[1:06:52.000 --> 1:06:56.000]  from the media, they would figure out what they want.
[1:06:56.000 --> 1:06:58.000]  And we're literally doing that.
[1:06:58.000 --> 1:07:00.000]  We have been motivated.
[1:07:00.000 --> 1:07:03.000]  We figured out what we wanted, which is freedom from tyranny.
[1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:05.000]  And we're willing to send against that.
[1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:07.000]  When you say 1776 is the answer to 1984,
[1:07:07.000 --> 1:07:10.000]  and your involvement in the Capitol incidents,
[1:07:10.000 --> 1:07:12.000]  I know you can put up an article from the Gateway Pond
[1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:15.000]  accusing me of inciting the violence and blah, blah, blah,
[1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:20.000]  feeding into the media narrative like you don't want others to do.
[1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:22.000]  Hold on a second. I don't mean to interrupt you.
[1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:24.000]  I'm on the road. I don't see what they're putting up.
[1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:26.000]  Let's not put the articles up right now,
[1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:29.000]  and my question's coming up. I want him to have the floor uninterrupted.
[1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:32.000]  Please continue.
[1:07:32.000 --> 1:07:35.000]  One of your statements that I personally like,
[1:07:35.000 --> 1:07:37.000]  and I followed you for several years,
[1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:39.000]  according, I am with Owen Schroyer.
[1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:42.000]  I started, I showed interest in Owen Schroyer back in,
[1:07:42.000 --> 1:07:45.000]  I think the end of 2019 when he was taken off the Capitol floor.
[1:07:45.000 --> 1:07:48.000]  But 1776 is the answer to 1984.
[1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:52.000]  I want to picture you a picture from 1776.
[1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:56.000]  On January 18th, Major Habasheen arrest a royal governor, James Wright.
[1:07:56.000 --> 1:07:59.000]  March 2nd, Americans begin shelling Boston, March 4th.
[1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:02.000]  We captured Dorchester Heights after a bloody battle.
[1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:04.000]  April 7th, we had a bloody major sea battle.
[1:08:04.000 --> 1:08:06.000]  August 27th, we had the battle of Long Island.
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:08.000]  September 15th, we had another bloody battle.
[1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:11.000]  September 21st, New York City, a quarter of it was burned.
[1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:13.000]  October 11th, we had another bloody battle.
[1:08:13.000 --> 1:08:16.000]  That's just one of the many instances of 1776.
[1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:19.000]  So when you call for 1776,
[1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:23.000]  I almost feel like you're doing it just for the merch and not for the actual fact.
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:28.000]  We understand that our laws,
[1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:33.000]  our avenues that we should go through have been clogged up by old mid and politics.
[1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:35.000]  Politicians who were there for the money, they've been clogged up.
[1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:38.000]  They blocked us from actually having access to our rights.
[1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:41.000]  They've infringed upon constitutional rights,
[1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:43.000]  whether it be the First Amendment, the Second Amendment, the Fourth Amendment,
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:44.000]  it doesn't matter.
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:46.000]  They've infringed on those rights.
[1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:49.000]  And we've realized that those avenues are no longer open to us.
[1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:53.000]  And so the only answer to that is to try to win the hearts and minds of the people.
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:55.000]  And ultimately, there is going to be a revolution.
[1:08:55.000 --> 1:08:58.000]  Even you know this, and I know this.
[1:08:58.000 --> 1:09:01.000]  As far as the Google is concerned, we're centrist.
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:05.000]  Most of us, we're libertarian.
[1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:08.000]  And we believe in freedom and liberty.
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:10.000]  We don't identify with the right.
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:12.000]  We don't identify with the left.
[1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:16.000]  We support for everybody, whether we agree with what they're saying or not,
[1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:19.000]  if they're on public space and it's a peaceful protest, we support that.
[1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:22.000]  We've defended peaceful protest repeatedly.
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:26.000]  When we stand up and do what you've asked for, you know, we're 5% of the people.
[1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:29.000]  When we stand up and we're actually doing something and we're believing in it,
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:31.000]  as a young man I served in the Corps, I got injured.
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:33.000]  I ended up with nerve damage around my heart.
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:37.000]  But as a young man who's standing up and then to see you come out and say,
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  hey, these guys are CIA ops, unbeknownst to them,
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:45.000]  I feel that it was rather ridiculous because a lot of these boys had put their heart,
[1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:48.000]  time, and soul into standing for what they believe in.
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:49.000]  We've lost lives.
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:50.000]  Duncan Lent was killed.
[1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:54.000]  Buddy, a personal friend of mine, was killed in Montgomery County, Maryland by police.
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:09:56.000]  He was a blue-blue boy.
[1:09:56.000 --> 1:09:58.000]  They went to serve the Nodoc search warrant on him, which is a red flag law,
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:00.000]  which also was endorsed by President Donald Trump.
[1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  They went and served that on him and killed him.
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:06.000]  And then those of us who stood up and stand out and say, hey, we're done.
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:07.000]  We don't care anymore.
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:09.000]  We are the sons of liberty.
[1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:12.000]  We are going to engage in civil disobedience.
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:16.000]  We're not with this targeting private businesses, but if it's a government facility
[1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:20.000]  and it's against the government that continues to oppress, then we're going to do it.
[1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:22.000]  We all saw widespread voter fraud.
[1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:24.000]  We all understand what happened in the election.
[1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  We're not Trump fans.
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:26.000]  We're not Biden fans.
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:27.000]  We understand that.
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:30.000]  But a lot of you hold on to the hope of voting your way out of voter fraud,
[1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:32.000]  which is an impossibility.
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:34.000]  We see it as there has to be a revolution.
[1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:36.000]  There has to be a result.
[1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:37.000]  And it's going to come through that.
[1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:40.000]  We pre-unity, bottom-scale unity against the elitists, the globalists,
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  the people who control our country, the people who control our presidents,
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  which you talked about previously.
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:49.000]  We see that as a way to say, hey, we're done with tyranny and we're going to stand against it.
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:53.000]  We're part of those 3% that have stood up or, in your case, from your quote,
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:55.000]  you know, it's just 5% of people.
[1:10:55.000 --> 1:10:56.000]  We're part of that.
[1:10:56.000 --> 1:10:57.000]  We're the ones who stood up.
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  And that's pretty much all I had to say concerning, you know, the boogaloo and what we're about.
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  We're about freedom and liberty for all people, non-discrimination,
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  and the Constitution being applicable to those who disagree with you.
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:10.000]  So.
[1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  Okay, Mike, very interesting points.
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:14.000]  I wanted to give you the floor.
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  So I'm not accused of overrunning you or not letting you talk.
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:19.000]  I do appreciate that.
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:23.000]  You probably noticed it came out that Enrique Tario Reuters has the documents
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:25.000]  that he was actually a federal informant.
[1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:27.000]  Does that come as a surprise to you?
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:33.000]  Yes, I uploaded that to my Twitter about 20 minutes ago.
[1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:35.000]  See, Mike, that's another question.
[1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:37.000]  Maybe you don't get the big picture.
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  You seem like a smart guy.
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:41.000]  But there's a lot of things going into this.
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:45.000]  You still have a Twitter, but people like me don't.
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:47.000]  Yeah, let's talk about that.
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  Hardware ban on Facebook, search terms associated with me or ban on Facebook.
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:52.000]  Instagram has hardware ban me.
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:55.000]  Search terms associated with me are limited on Instagram.
[1:11:55.000 --> 1:12:00.000]  Almost every other news media, almost every other like social media outlet has ban me.
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:02.000]  Twitter has repeatedly ban me.
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  It's happening.
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:06.000]  Happening to bypass the ban quietly and quickly.
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:08.000]  They'll ban me eventually again.
[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:10.000]  It's just a matter of finding ways around it.
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:12.000]  So before you go on that, we're banned everywhere.
[1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:13.000]  People in the mood.
[1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:15.000]  Listen, I'm not calling for your banning.
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:17.000]  I think everybody should have a voice, whether it's the I.T.O.L.A.
[1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:20.000]  Homanie or you or me or Trump or anybody.
[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:22.000]  We're going to go to break.
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  And I want to come back and I want to unpack first what you said.
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:26.000]  Because it's true.
[1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:28.000]  I say the answer in 1984 is 1776.
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:30.000]  And I mean an ideology, an ideal.
[1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  When I say 1776 worldwide, I mean Americana Renaissance ideology
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:37.000]  over communist and globalist ideology.
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:39.000]  And I believe you're being attacked.
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  I believe the Uyghurs or I believe the Buddhists have a right to fight back physically in China.
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:44.000]  And we're rapidly approaching that point.
[1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:45.000]  We are.
[1:12:45.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  I think the way things are being done, the strategic plan we had that day
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:51.000]  to get an investigation of voter fraud.
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  The perfect thing for the globalists.
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:56.000]  Everybody confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture.
[1:12:56.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  Me too.
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:13:01.000]  But listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling,
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:04.000]  there's one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  It's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death.
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:11.000]  You probably already believe that.
[1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:12.000]  I certainly do.
[1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:13.000]  So here's the thing.
[1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:17.000]  I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant-based substances
[1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  actually have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  Now, you'll have to sign a waiver,
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  but you can check out what I've discovered at StrongerDefense.com.

[1:16:42.000 --> 1:16:44.000]  It's time to start getting prepared.
[1:16:44.000 --> 1:16:45.000]  It starts with self-defense.
[1:16:45.000 --> 1:16:46.000]  It starts with being prepared.
[1:16:46.000 --> 1:16:47.000]  It starts with horrible food.
[1:16:47.000 --> 1:16:50.000]  It starts with digging in with a long, globalist fight.
[1:16:50.000 --> 1:16:57.000]  You'll win in the end.
[1:16:57.000 --> 1:17:07.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:17:07.000 --> 1:17:22.000]  I'm your host Alex Jones in Utah on a family vacation
[1:17:22.000 --> 1:17:26.000]  doing some skiing, doing some hiking,
[1:17:26.000 --> 1:17:28.000]  hanging out with the crews that came with me
[1:17:28.000 --> 1:17:31.000]  and we've got Owen Schroyer back in the ATX in Austin, Texas.
[1:17:31.000 --> 1:17:36.000]  Mike Dunn is one of the prominent Boogaloo boys
[1:17:36.000 --> 1:17:38.000]  and I guess we get to the history of it
[1:17:38.000 --> 1:17:41.000]  and how long it's been around and where it's going
[1:17:41.000 --> 1:17:45.000]  and it's a different political ideologies and the rest of it.
[1:17:45.000 --> 1:17:48.000]  But you were getting Mike in the 1776
[1:17:48.000 --> 1:17:50.000]  and saying pretty much,
[1:17:50.000 --> 1:17:53.000]  Jones, you kind of ordered us, just what I heard, to go do this.
[1:17:53.000 --> 1:17:57.000]  Well, I thought I was there to have a big demonstration
[1:17:57.000 --> 1:17:59.000]  and then march with the president
[1:17:59.000 --> 1:18:02.000]  and then encamp around the Capitol peacefully
[1:18:02.000 --> 1:18:03.000]  and we kind of had a blind spot
[1:18:03.000 --> 1:18:05.000]  because Trump rallies are always so peaceful.
[1:18:05.000 --> 1:18:08.000]  We know very small groups, antiphones, some other folks
[1:18:08.000 --> 1:18:10.000]  help break through, help get in.
[1:18:10.000 --> 1:18:12.000]  Then a few hundred people went in.
[1:18:12.000 --> 1:18:14.000]  They stayed within the velvet robes.
[1:18:14.000 --> 1:18:16.000]  So I don't think this was anywhere near Pearl Harbor.
[1:18:16.000 --> 1:18:21.000]  As Jackie Schumer said, it's about a 1-1 millionth of Pearl Harbor.
[1:18:21.000 --> 1:18:25.000]  And so I'm just trying to figure out,
[1:18:25.000 --> 1:18:27.000]  are these, because you mentioned this
[1:18:27.000 --> 1:18:30.000]  and you respond to the 1776 thing,
[1:18:30.000 --> 1:18:32.000]  because I'm somebody that's very clear that I believe
[1:18:32.000 --> 1:18:35.000]  in civil disobedience, I believe,
[1:18:35.000 --> 1:18:39.000]  in defensive defense and violence.
[1:18:39.000 --> 1:18:41.000]  I really want to fix this peacefully.
[1:18:41.000 --> 1:18:43.000]  In fact, let's just go there first.
[1:18:43.000 --> 1:18:46.000]  You're saying, listening to my work, my energy,
[1:18:46.000 --> 1:18:50.000]  you're taking from that the idea of revolution or armed conflict?
[1:18:50.000 --> 1:18:52.000]  I definitely wouldn't say that.
[1:18:52.000 --> 1:18:53.000]  I took it directly from you.
[1:18:53.000 --> 1:18:55.000]  I'm just saying that the idea that you portray
[1:18:55.000 --> 1:19:00.000]  and the message that you carry sometimes tend to look like
[1:19:00.000 --> 1:19:05.000]  you're just there to create merch and not actually stand for
[1:19:05.000 --> 1:19:06.000]  an actual revolution.
[1:19:06.000 --> 1:19:10.000]  You talk about peaceful protesting and I always thought,
[1:19:10.000 --> 1:19:12.000]  the Alex Jones I listened to growing up was someone
[1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:14.000]  who wanted the government to fear the people.
[1:19:14.000 --> 1:19:18.000]  And so I'm not saying that you incited it or you directed it,
[1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:23.000]  but I am saying that if you continue to preach a 1776 revolution
[1:19:23.000 --> 1:19:25.000]  or the type of message that you preach,
[1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:28.000]  you're going to have to figure out whether you're just going
[1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:30.000]  to need to continue to make your talk show
[1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:32.000]  or if you're actually going to stand against the cheering
[1:19:32.000 --> 1:19:34.000]  that is present in the US.
[1:19:34.000 --> 1:19:37.000]  Well, Mike, let's be 100% clear.
[1:19:37.000 --> 1:19:40.000]  You better believe I sell t-shirts and I sell product.
[1:19:40.000 --> 1:19:41.000]  That gets the word out.
[1:19:41.000 --> 1:19:42.000]  That's identification.
[1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:43.000]  Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[1:19:43.000 --> 1:19:44.000]  They want to shut us down.
[1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:45.000]  They want to kill our speech.
[1:19:45.000 --> 1:19:48.000]  They don't want us to exercise our speech online.
[1:19:48.000 --> 1:19:52.000]  You guys wear your shirts that are Hawaiian shirts to see to be known.
[1:19:52.000 --> 1:19:54.000]  We're info wars and damn right,
[1:19:54.000 --> 1:19:57.000]  I've got the globalists trying to shut me down.
[1:19:57.000 --> 1:19:58.000]  I'm a capitalist.
[1:19:58.000 --> 1:20:02.000]  I didn't get $10.6 billion from Democrat donors
[1:20:02.000 --> 1:20:04.000]  in George Soros like Black Lives Matter.
[1:20:04.000 --> 1:20:08.000]  So I don't get any funding like Antifa or BLM.
[1:20:08.000 --> 1:20:10.000]  I don't have people volunteering to do my security.
[1:20:10.000 --> 1:20:11.000]  I pay my security.
[1:20:11.000 --> 1:20:13.000]  I don't have the Boogaloo Boys volunteering for my security.
[1:20:13.000 --> 1:20:15.000]  I pay for my security.
[1:20:15.000 --> 1:20:16.000]  So I'm a capitalist.
[1:20:16.000 --> 1:20:19.000]  I am not ashamed of selling products, but to be clear,
[1:20:19.000 --> 1:20:23.000]  if we get to a point where I think I've got to be violent,
[1:20:23.000 --> 1:20:25.000]  then I'll do what I have to do.
[1:20:25.000 --> 1:20:26.000]  That's why I'm fighting so hard.
[1:20:26.000 --> 1:20:28.000]  That's why I'm fighting so hard because I'm not going to stand around
[1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:30.000]  capitals with guns if I get violent.
[1:20:30.000 --> 1:20:31.000]  Okay.
[1:20:31.000 --> 1:20:33.000]  Tell me how this, today you got the floor again.
[1:20:33.000 --> 1:20:35.000]  How's this revolution look?
[1:20:35.000 --> 1:20:36.000]  How do you see this thing unfolding?
[1:20:36.000 --> 1:20:39.000]  Tell me General George Washington 2.0.
[1:20:39.000 --> 1:20:41.000]  How are we going to do this revolution?
[1:20:41.000 --> 1:20:42.000]  I don't know.
[1:20:42.000 --> 1:20:45.000]  I thought you were the General George Washington 2.0.
[1:20:45.000 --> 1:20:46.000]  No, no, no.
[1:20:46.000 --> 1:20:48.000]  I'm not the guy out there saying we're going to have a revolution.
[1:20:48.000 --> 1:20:52.000]  So tell me, we need a declaration of independence by the states.
[1:20:52.000 --> 1:20:55.000]  We need a coalition of leaders ready with a bill of particulars of what we want.
[1:20:55.000 --> 1:20:57.000]  And then we go to war.
[1:20:57.000 --> 1:20:59.000]  Not a bunch of people taking selfies in the Capitol.
[1:20:59.000 --> 1:21:00.000]  That's the opposite of what we need.
[1:21:00.000 --> 1:21:01.000]  We need George Washington.
[1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:02.000]  He hasn't shown up yet.
[1:21:02.000 --> 1:21:05.000]  So I'm telling you, tell me what we do.
[1:21:05.000 --> 1:21:09.000]  General Dunn, what do we do right now?
[1:21:09.000 --> 1:21:10.000]  Go for it.
[1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:12.000]  Get those papers in order.
[1:21:12.000 --> 1:21:15.000]  Get the plan of government for after in order and actually get it done
[1:21:15.000 --> 1:21:17.000]  and start building the forces like you're supposed to.
[1:21:17.000 --> 1:21:18.000]  Like all of us have done.
[1:21:18.000 --> 1:21:19.000]  We've been together.
[1:21:19.000 --> 1:21:20.000]  We've stood together.
[1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:22.000]  We go to our capitals on where they say, you know,
[1:21:22.000 --> 1:21:25.000]  in Richmond, Virginia, Owen Schroyer drove there.
[1:21:25.000 --> 1:21:26.000]  He saw some of my guys.
[1:21:26.000 --> 1:21:27.000]  They're armed.
[1:21:27.000 --> 1:21:28.000]  They said, hey, you can't open carry here anymore.
[1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:29.000]  It's illegal now.
[1:21:29.000 --> 1:21:30.000]  We went.
[1:21:30.000 --> 1:21:31.000]  We dissipated.
[1:21:31.000 --> 1:21:33.000]  If they had tried to arrest us, we would have used the Second Amendment the way
[1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:35.000]  that it was attended, which is to say that again.
[1:21:35.000 --> 1:21:36.000]  Where did you do this?
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:38.000]  Because this is you put your money where your mouth is.
[1:21:38.000 --> 1:21:39.000]  Where did you do this?
[1:21:39.000 --> 1:21:40.000]  This is in Richmond, Virginia.
[1:21:40.000 --> 1:21:43.000]  It's illegal to open carry any protest or even arm.
[1:21:43.000 --> 1:21:47.000]  So we go there for for Owen Schroyer's thing when he came through with a stop
[1:21:47.000 --> 1:21:48.000]  to steal.
[1:21:48.000 --> 1:21:51.000]  We've been at every protest, whether it be MAGA, Black Lives Matter, anything to
[1:21:51.000 --> 1:21:54.000]  make sure that things are peaceful and respectful.
[1:21:54.000 --> 1:21:55.000]  And we go there on.
[1:21:55.000 --> 1:21:56.000]  We disobey the law.
[1:21:56.000 --> 1:21:58.000]  We stand against the tyranny.
[1:21:58.000 --> 1:22:02.000]  And what we see people like you, Alex, who used, you know, used to be my hero as
[1:22:02.000 --> 1:22:05.000]  a young man, we see y'all been in the need to it repeatedly.
[1:22:05.000 --> 1:22:07.000]  You have your talk shows.
[1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:09.000]  You give your speeches, but y'all don't actually stand against tyranny.
[1:22:09.000 --> 1:22:12.000]  And that's disheartening as a young man, a young American and someone involved in
[1:22:12.000 --> 1:22:15.000]  the Liberty movement and constitutionalism.
[1:22:15.000 --> 1:22:16.000]  Personally, not.
[1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:17.000]  I'm not.
[1:22:17.000 --> 1:22:18.000]  How is it not?
[1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:19.000]  How am I not standing?
[1:22:19.000 --> 1:22:20.000]  It's tyranny.
[1:22:20.000 --> 1:22:23.000]  It's legislation marching, going out and having events.
[1:22:23.000 --> 1:22:24.000]  Sorry.
[1:22:24.000 --> 1:22:27.000]  Because, because you talk, we go out there.
[1:22:27.000 --> 1:22:28.000]  We actually disobey.
[1:22:28.000 --> 1:22:29.000]  We stand there armed.
[1:22:29.000 --> 1:22:30.000]  We're not willing to.
[1:22:30.000 --> 1:22:33.000]  We don't boot lick like a lot of you and Republicans do.
[1:22:33.000 --> 1:22:35.000]  We actually stand up against the tyranny.
[1:22:35.000 --> 1:22:36.000]  That is prevalent.
[1:22:36.000 --> 1:22:39.000]  That's what I want to see y'all do when you ask, well, what's the revolution look
[1:22:39.000 --> 1:22:40.000]  like?
[1:22:40.000 --> 1:22:41.000]  Well, there you go.
[1:22:41.000 --> 1:22:42.000]  It's us engaging in civil disobedience.
[1:22:42.000 --> 1:22:46.000]  And if they decide to do something, then we'll stand against that.
[1:22:46.000 --> 1:22:49.000]  You're not going out there where they say, Hey, you, you can't open carry here.
[1:22:49.000 --> 1:22:51.000]  You can't exercise the constitutional right.
[1:22:51.000 --> 1:22:52.000]  You're not going out there and disobeyed it.
[1:22:52.000 --> 1:22:55.000]  Y'all want to do everything by the law because you're the party of law and order.
[1:22:55.000 --> 1:23:00.000]  Well, no, I have, I have supported open carry and I've supported the lawsuits and
[1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:01.000]  all the rest of it.
[1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:02.000]  So that's, that's not a fair statement.
[1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:09.000]  What I'm getting at here is the strategic blunder of rushing into the capital, the
[1:23:09.000 --> 1:23:14.000]  strategic blunder of the selfies and the cutar stuff and all the rest of it is not
[1:23:14.000 --> 1:23:15.000]  what I wanted.
[1:23:15.000 --> 1:23:16.000]  It's not what I wanted.
[1:23:16.000 --> 1:23:19.000]  It's not a rally to try to put pressure on them to have a 10 day investigation of a
[1:23:19.000 --> 1:23:20.000]  lesion fraud.
[1:23:20.000 --> 1:23:25.000]  So, so, so wait, do you think what happened to the capital was a victory or a fiasco?
[1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:28.000]  I definitely think it, it was the right thing for the wrong reasons.
[1:23:28.000 --> 1:23:30.000]  I think it was a good way to make government for the people again.
[1:23:30.000 --> 1:23:34.000]  It was nice to see members of Congress on their knees, fearing the people.
[1:23:34.000 --> 1:23:39.000]  I think it was the right thing for the wrong reasons.
[1:23:39.000 --> 1:23:44.000]  So you now wish that people wouldn't have knocked down the doors and gone in there.
[1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:47.000]  I wish a hundred percent that people would do it more all over this country and make
[1:23:47.000 --> 1:23:50.000]  government for the people.
[1:23:50.000 --> 1:23:53.000]  You know, if I may chime in here, because I've been brought up a couple, I've been
[1:23:53.000 --> 1:23:56.000]  brought up a couple of times, you know, here's what I think the problem is.
[1:23:56.000 --> 1:23:58.000]  And this is what I said after January 6th.
[1:23:58.000 --> 1:24:04.000]  We can, we can discuss the events of January 6th, what happened or what 1776 to defeat
[1:24:04.000 --> 1:24:05.000]  1984 means.
[1:24:05.000 --> 1:24:09.000]  The problem is we're not actually having that intellectual debate.
[1:24:09.000 --> 1:24:12.000]  There's no doubt that we have encroaching global government.
[1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:14.000]  There's no doubt that the government's out of control.
[1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:19.000]  There's no doubt that the biggest crooks in America are in Washington, D.C.
[1:24:19.000 --> 1:24:21.000]  I think 90% of Americans would agree to that.
[1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:23.000]  Here's the problem though.
[1:24:23.000 --> 1:24:25.000]  And Mike, I'd like to get your response to this.
[1:24:25.000 --> 1:24:31.000]  We're not in a 1776 colonists versus the British government time where we're hiding
[1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:36.000]  in the woods and we've got the local communities and they don't have a world
[1:24:36.000 --> 1:24:40.000]  technocracy set up against us or a federal government set up against us.
[1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:43.000]  I mean, I've been to jail multiple times for my free speech.
[1:24:43.000 --> 1:24:44.000]  You know that.
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:45.000]  So, I mean, to sit here and say...
[1:24:45.000 --> 1:24:48.000]  No, you've done nothing because you didn't stand around in a Hawaiian shirt with a gun.
[1:24:48.000 --> 1:24:52.000]  But my point is, you, I mean, if you really think you're going to launch some sort of
[1:24:52.000 --> 1:24:57.000]  a physical, you know, kinetic war against the deep state or against D.C., there's just
[1:24:57.000 --> 1:24:59.000]  no path to victory there.
[1:24:59.000 --> 1:25:01.000]  I mean, the whole federal government is against you.
[1:25:01.000 --> 1:25:02.000]  Well, there actually is.
[1:25:02.000 --> 1:25:03.000]  Let's go to break it.
[1:25:03.000 --> 1:25:07.000]  I'm not calling for this, but the Capitol is a puppet place.
[1:25:07.000 --> 1:25:09.000]  They didn't like Trump because he wasn't a puppet.
[1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:10.000]  He made mistakes.
[1:25:10.000 --> 1:25:11.000]  He was actually the president.
[1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:12.000]  They fear Holly.
[1:25:12.000 --> 1:25:13.000]  They fear Cruz.
[1:25:13.000 --> 1:25:19.000]  They fear, to a lesser extent, Paul, because they know they're real men who aren't pieces
[1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:20.000]  of filth.
[1:25:20.000 --> 1:25:21.000]  We need leadership there.
[1:25:21.000 --> 1:25:27.000]  But I'm telling you that the target, if Boogaloo's are real, and I'm not saying do this, but
[1:25:27.000 --> 1:25:30.000]  if you really want a violent revolution, you should be calling for the Council on Foreign
[1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:31.000]  Relations.
[1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:34.000]  Every member should be in a deck of cards, the whole leadership, Richard and Haas, all
[1:25:34.000 --> 1:25:35.000]  the rest of them.
[1:25:35.000 --> 1:25:38.000]  And I, the last thing I want is anything to happen to Bill Gates or Richard and Haas
[1:25:38.000 --> 1:25:39.000]  or any of them.
[1:25:39.000 --> 1:25:42.000]  I'm just saying if you really want to do this, Klaus Schwab should be the ace of spades.
[1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:45.000]  And then Bill Gates is, you know, right after that.
[1:25:45.000 --> 1:25:46.000]  Okay.
[1:25:46.000 --> 1:25:48.000]  I'm just telling you, man, you're hitting the wrong target.
[1:25:48.000 --> 1:25:51.000]  Like a monkey fucking a football.
[1:25:51.000 --> 1:25:52.000]  Backstay with us.
[1:25:52.000 --> 1:25:56.000]  The globalists are taking control of the entire human genome.
[1:25:56.000 --> 1:25:58.000]  They are forcing mutations.
[1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:01.000]  This is forced evolution or de-evolution.
[1:26:01.000 --> 1:26:06.000]  When you look at all the major research, all the major programs they're carrying out,
[1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:11.000]  they are not to produce people that are smarter or folks that live longer or more moral.
[1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:14.000]  No, it's turning humanity into a commodity.
[1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:19.000]  Now we see some propaganda like communist China bragging, hey, we've done mRNA vaccines
[1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:21.000]  to make our soldiers Superman.
[1:26:21.000 --> 1:26:25.000]  That's a way to make it sexy that, hey, we're experimenting on our troops.
[1:26:25.000 --> 1:26:27.000]  Well, same thing with that into our troops.
[1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:32.000]  And thousands and thousands of died each time they tried a new experimental vaccine.
[1:26:32.000 --> 1:26:36.000]  I've talked to high level folks inside the federal government and the state of Texas health department.
[1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:38.000]  They say Alex, you know, it hurts a lot of people.
[1:26:38.000 --> 1:26:40.000]  It's for a greater good.
[1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:41.000]  But that's not even true.
[1:26:41.000 --> 1:26:45.000]  And it violates the Geneva Convention, the Nuremberg Code, federal and state law.
[1:26:45.000 --> 1:26:48.000]  This is violence being carried out against us by that as a charity.
[1:26:48.000 --> 1:26:53.000]  And we have a right to resist it with any means necessary.
[1:26:53.000 --> 1:27:00.000]  Due to the COVID lockdown destroying the supply chain, many of the best selling products in fours are no longer available.
[1:27:00.000 --> 1:27:02.000]  And I thought that pollen block might be gone forever.
[1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:08.000]  But after eight months, we got about 25% of the order we put in delivered to us.
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:10.000]  The rest they hope in a few months comes in.
[1:27:10.000 --> 1:27:16.000]  It's a proprietary system using specially fed quail and their eggs.
[1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:21.000]  It's very powerful when it comes to blocking seasonal irritants and a lot more.

[1:29:17.000 --> 1:29:19.000]  And it's gonna do the rest.
[1:29:19.000 --> 1:29:22.000]  The West is the best.
[1:29:22.000 --> 1:29:24.000]  Though everybody's trying to get into the West.
[1:29:24.000 --> 1:29:27.000]  What is it about the West? What is it?
[1:29:27.000 --> 1:29:30.000]  Get here and we'll do the rest.
[1:29:30.000 --> 1:29:39.000]  Since 2019 at least 31 people affiliated with the Boogaloo movement have been charged with crimes including the killing of two security and law enforcement officers.
[1:29:39.000 --> 1:29:46.000]  A plot to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, the scariest looking woman alive.
[1:29:46.000 --> 1:29:50.000]  Incas related to the George Floyd protest and the storming of the U.S. Capitol.
[1:29:50.000 --> 1:30:00.000]  And in mid 2020, several companies acted to limit the movement's activities and visibility on their social media chat platforms.
[1:30:00.000 --> 1:30:04.000]  You have the guys with the pipe bombs and all of their plans.
[1:30:04.000 --> 1:30:09.000]  Let me ask Mr. Dunn, the founder of the Boogaloo's.
[1:30:09.000 --> 1:30:11.000]  Let me ask him this question.
[1:30:11.000 --> 1:30:15.000]  Are those people that don't speak for Boogaloo's?
[1:30:15.000 --> 1:30:17.000]  You're one of the most prominent members of these here.
[1:30:17.000 --> 1:30:19.000]  Not the leader, but you're the guy that always gets brought up.
[1:30:19.000 --> 1:30:22.000]  I mean, who are these people getting arrested?
[1:30:22.000 --> 1:30:27.000]  Are they launching the good revolution or are those not good Boogaloo's?
[1:30:27.000 --> 1:30:29.000]  It's like anything.
[1:30:29.000 --> 1:30:33.000]  Some are legitimate Boogaloo boys who we knew who were in our circles.
[1:30:33.000 --> 1:30:36.000]  And then once again, anybody can claim, hey, I'm Boogaloo.
[1:30:36.000 --> 1:30:41.000]  Just like anybody can claim they're associated with you or claim that you had started the insurrection.
[1:30:41.000 --> 1:30:44.000]  I wanted to answer Owen's question or Owen's statement from a minute ago.
[1:30:44.000 --> 1:30:47.000]  If I could have permission to do that.
[1:30:47.000 --> 1:30:50.000]  Sure, go ahead and jump in anytime you want.
[1:30:50.000 --> 1:30:52.000]  You know, my response to it.
[1:30:52.000 --> 1:31:01.000]  And he was what I think he was leaning into and what he had mentioned, you know, legislative bodies going, going through the courts, the lawful way of protests and so on.
[1:31:01.000 --> 1:31:08.000]  And if you haven't noticed for about the past 160 years since the last war, we've done that.
[1:31:08.000 --> 1:31:10.000]  Those avenues have been used.
[1:31:10.000 --> 1:31:17.000]  And if you think you can vote your way out of voter fraud or push your rights through the courts that have already tread on those.
[1:31:17.000 --> 1:31:19.000]  Hold on. Let me just stop because let me finish my statement.
[1:31:19.000 --> 1:31:21.000]  Let me just finish my statement to give more clarity.
[1:31:21.000 --> 1:31:30.000]  I'm just saying to if you really think that a violent revolution is the answer, you got to understand you're going up against a completely different enemy than what we had in 1776.
[1:31:30.000 --> 1:31:33.000]  Way more powerful, way more seditious, way more in the shadows.
[1:31:33.000 --> 1:31:35.000]  The feds come to arrest you in the middle of the night.
[1:31:35.000 --> 1:31:37.000]  Nobody's going to have your back.
[1:31:37.000 --> 1:31:38.000]  Who's going to have your back?
[1:31:38.000 --> 1:31:39.000]  They'll just disappear you.
[1:31:39.000 --> 1:31:43.000]  And I think the thing we have to do first, Mike, let me finish, please, sir.
[1:31:43.000 --> 1:31:48.000]  The thing we have to do first is we have to have common unity.
[1:31:48.000 --> 1:31:52.000]  This can't be Boogaloo vs. Info Wars or Mike vs. Alex or Owen vs. this or Black Lives Matter here.
[1:31:52.000 --> 1:31:56.000]  Everyone, I can disagree with Black Lives Matter, Antifa, Boogaloo, whatever all day long.
[1:31:56.000 --> 1:31:58.000]  We're all anti-establishment.
[1:31:58.000 --> 1:32:00.000]  We have to come together and have that unity.
[1:32:00.000 --> 1:32:06.000]  That will have our politicians in more fear is us having unity than saying we're coming with guns.
[1:32:06.000 --> 1:32:09.000]  They'll wipe us off the map if we do that.
[1:32:09.000 --> 1:32:11.000]  Do you know the military will have our back?
[1:32:11.000 --> 1:32:12.000]  We don't know that.
[1:32:12.000 --> 1:32:13.000]  Unity has to be the first thing.
[1:32:13.000 --> 1:32:14.000]  Let's go further.
[1:32:14.000 --> 1:32:20.000]  Swallowswell says that he'll nuke American gun owners, which is totally unfeasible and ridiculous and insane.
[1:32:20.000 --> 1:32:22.000]  And he doesn't even know what he's talking about.
[1:32:22.000 --> 1:32:24.000]  Just look, look, look, look, here's the deal.
[1:32:24.000 --> 1:32:25.000]  Mike, I get you on here.
[1:32:25.000 --> 1:32:27.000]  You seem like a real guy.
[1:32:27.000 --> 1:32:29.000]  You don't seem like a Southern Poverty Law Center operative.
[1:32:29.000 --> 1:32:31.000]  You don't seem like an ADL operative.
[1:32:31.000 --> 1:32:40.000]  But certainly, Mike, you know about the Southern Poverty Law Center's history of infiltrating militias, populist right-wing groups, and then provocaturing them.
[1:32:40.000 --> 1:32:43.000]  I mean, do you know about the long history of false flags?
[1:32:43.000 --> 1:32:44.000]  Yeah, I do.
[1:32:44.000 --> 1:32:50.000]  And I just wanted to respond to Owen real quick and say that's exactly what we have been doing.
[1:32:50.000 --> 1:32:54.000]  Michigan, Ohio, look up Magnus on Twitter, his speech.
[1:32:54.000 --> 1:32:58.000]  We've been uniting people under Black Lives Matter, traditional militias.
[1:32:58.000 --> 1:33:03.000]  We've been uniting them for one common cause, but yet, you know, we put in that work.
[1:33:03.000 --> 1:33:04.000]  We've done that.
[1:33:04.000 --> 1:33:14.000]  You can go back to one of my first public events, which was July 4th of last year, where we united Black Lives Matter gun owners and constitutional gun owners that were either right or libertarian.
[1:33:14.000 --> 1:33:17.000]  We put them together and we stood together in solidarity.
[1:33:17.000 --> 1:33:23.000]  But then, you know, all we get is division and preaching division from the people in the Republican Party.
[1:33:23.000 --> 1:33:28.000]  Well, that means you got with Black Lives Matter low levels that weren't Soros Democratic Party.
[1:33:28.000 --> 1:33:33.000]  And I've seen the videos because a lot of well-meaning Black folks come out thinking they're doing something.
[1:33:33.000 --> 1:33:39.000]  I mean, come on, man, George Soros and the UN, the globalist run Black Lives Matter, $10.6 billion in funding.
[1:33:39.000 --> 1:33:40.000]  You know that, right?
[1:33:40.000 --> 1:33:42.000]  But notice how Black Lives Matter goes after private business.
[1:33:42.000 --> 1:33:43.000]  Hold on. Let me talk. Let me talk.
[1:33:43.000 --> 1:33:44.000]  We'll go to the next hour if need to.
[1:33:44.000 --> 1:33:47.000]  Just get your time on, but just explain that to me.
[1:33:47.000 --> 1:33:49.000]  I agree, Alex.
[1:33:49.000 --> 1:33:59.000]  The organization is funded by people who have misused them, but a lot of the movement or they're actual individuals who believe what they stand for.
[1:33:59.000 --> 1:34:01.000]  And we stand by the fact that Black Lives Matter.
[1:34:01.000 --> 1:34:05.000]  I've seen them actually racially discriminated against in my own cities.
[1:34:05.000 --> 1:34:07.000]  So I'm willing to stand with them and defend their right to speak.
[1:34:07.000 --> 1:34:09.000]  You see that picture right there you just put up.
[1:34:09.000 --> 1:34:12.000]  The police did not touch that peaceful protest while we were on the frontline arm.
[1:34:12.000 --> 1:34:14.000]  They did not touch them.
[1:34:14.000 --> 1:34:24.000]  Antifa started chatting F Mike Dunn, F Boogaloo's, F Black Lives Matter 757, which is an organization that has reached out to us and actually formed a cohesive body.
[1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:26.000]  And we stood together side by side.
[1:34:26.000 --> 1:34:29.000]  They started chatting that we left because we said, hey, we don't want to split the crowd.
[1:34:29.000 --> 1:34:30.000]  Y'all do your thing.
[1:34:30.000 --> 1:34:31.000]  The minute we left.
[1:34:31.000 --> 1:34:35.000]  So you recognize that Antifa is a globalist organization.
[1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:39.000]  I recognize that a lot of Antifa factions are the same as Black Lives Matter.
[1:34:39.000 --> 1:34:49.000]  For example, here's photos that we were sent in Austin by one of our friends on the 20th or whatever.
[1:34:49.000 --> 1:34:51.000]  There's probably this big overthrow coming.
[1:34:51.000 --> 1:34:53.000]  And they had Antifa signs.
[1:34:53.000 --> 1:34:57.000]  They were Antifa posing basically as militia or Boogaloo's.
[1:34:57.000 --> 1:34:59.000]  And I mean, you look at some of the photos of these guys.
[1:34:59.000 --> 1:35:03.000]  They've got the classic method locked up in mommy's basement.
[1:35:03.000 --> 1:35:06.000]  They're Antifa not wearing their mask.
[1:35:06.000 --> 1:35:09.000]  I mean, just bring us up and some of them were saying they were Boogaloo's.
[1:35:09.000 --> 1:35:10.000]  I mean, look at this guy.
[1:35:10.000 --> 1:35:11.000]  Come on.
[1:35:11.000 --> 1:35:12.000]  What's up with the zip ties?
[1:35:12.000 --> 1:35:15.000]  So, so all I'm saying is they're saying armed revolutions coming.
[1:35:15.000 --> 1:35:18.000]  These are the people claiming they're with your movement.
[1:35:18.000 --> 1:35:20.000]  General Patton was in Tifa.
[1:35:20.000 --> 1:35:24.000]  And while you're throwing up those pictures, you probably want to throw up the rest of all the armed protests that we put on and done.
[1:35:24.000 --> 1:35:27.000]  So you can obviously pull a select picture and say, hey, these are the people.
[1:35:27.000 --> 1:35:28.000]  But until you actually go.
[1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:32.000]  General Patton actually wanted to join with the Germans and attack the Russians.
[1:35:32.000 --> 1:35:37.000]  So to say that he was Antifa is he was probably actually one of the only fascist generals we had.
[1:35:37.000 --> 1:35:38.000]  I'm not even against Patton.
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:43.000]  But you're now saying General George T. Patton was a was it was it was an Antifa.
[1:35:43.000 --> 1:35:47.000]  That led the force to fight and combat fascism is what I'm talking about.
[1:35:47.000 --> 1:35:49.000]  No, he was racing to take over Berlin.
[1:35:49.000 --> 1:35:52.000]  So you get the Nazis behind me to beat the Russians.
[1:35:52.000 --> 1:35:55.000]  Our country is why that's why they killed him, buddy.
[1:35:55.000 --> 1:35:58.000]  I interviewed the son of the guy that killed him.
[1:35:58.000 --> 1:36:00.000]  But we are Antifa.
[1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:01.000]  You can't argue that.
[1:36:01.000 --> 1:36:05.000]  Are you anti fascist or do you support fascism?
[1:36:05.000 --> 1:36:07.000]  You're taking these arguments at his value, Mike.
[1:36:07.000 --> 1:36:10.000]  If you try to ask an Antifa member, they don't really understand what's going on.
[1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:12.000]  Again, notice where they go.
[1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:13.000]  They don't go to Google.
[1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:14.000]  They don't go to government buildings.
[1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:15.000]  They don't go to capitals.
[1:36:15.000 --> 1:36:17.000]  They go to Home Depot.
[1:36:17.000 --> 1:36:19.000]  They go to, you know, 711.
[1:36:19.000 --> 1:36:20.000]  They burned down a quick trip.
[1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:21.000]  I mean, it's total chaos.
[1:36:21.000 --> 1:36:22.000]  You can't have that.
[1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:24.000]  They burned down somebody's private cardiolorship.
[1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:25.000]  So let's expand on this.
[1:36:25.000 --> 1:36:27.000]  You raised this done and I'm not here trying to attack you.
[1:36:27.000 --> 1:36:29.000]  I mean, you come off as a real person.
[1:36:29.000 --> 1:36:30.000]  I'll just say that.
[1:36:30.000 --> 1:36:31.000]  Exclusive.
[1:36:31.000 --> 1:36:32.000]  Boogaloo Boy.
[1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:33.000]  You raised this.
[1:36:33.000 --> 1:36:34.000]  We looked it up.
[1:36:34.000 --> 1:36:36.000]  Boogaloo Boy leader who aligns with Black Lives Matter.
[1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:37.000]  Because we didn't put this up.
[1:36:37.000 --> 1:36:38.000]  You're like, you can put that up on screen.
[1:36:38.000 --> 1:36:40.000]  I'm like, I didn't know.
[1:36:40.000 --> 1:36:41.000]  We didn't put this on screen.
[1:36:41.000 --> 1:36:42.000]  You raised it.
[1:36:42.000 --> 1:36:43.000]  We got it up.
[1:36:43.000 --> 1:36:46.000]  Exclusive Boogaloo Boy leader who aligns with Black Lives Matter.
[1:36:46.000 --> 1:36:47.000]  Gateway pundit.
[1:36:47.000 --> 1:36:50.000]  Both said about organizing arm insurrection on U.S. capital.
[1:36:50.000 --> 1:36:52.000]  Are these your archive tweets or not?
[1:36:52.000 --> 1:36:56.000]  About BB teams have been activated in Virginia.
[1:36:56.000 --> 1:36:58.000]  We are currently four fire teams.
[1:36:58.000 --> 1:37:01.000]  Those assault squads inside the capital.
[1:37:01.000 --> 1:37:03.000]  Semper, you know, death deterrence.
[1:37:03.000 --> 1:37:06.000]  And it's all right here about we rub it in your face.
[1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:07.000]  You have no security.
[1:37:07.000 --> 1:37:08.000]  We're in charge.
[1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:10.000]  Did you or did you not tweet that?
[1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:14.000]  1000% and note that the capital was not the same as the capital,
[1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:15.000]  which means the building.
[1:37:15.000 --> 1:37:16.000]  It means the city of BC.
[1:37:16.000 --> 1:37:17.000]  So note that.
[1:37:17.000 --> 1:37:21.000]  And furthermore note that media can twist anything that said out of
[1:37:21.000 --> 1:37:23.000]  perspective and take away from tweets.
[1:37:23.000 --> 1:37:26.000]  It was originally connected with that they can do that.
[1:37:26.000 --> 1:37:27.000]  They do it easily.
[1:37:27.000 --> 1:37:29.000]  But don't fall into the same thing that you preach against,
[1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:31.000]  which is listening to media.
[1:37:31.000 --> 1:37:34.000]  I trust them.
[1:37:34.000 --> 1:37:35.000]  I found them to be very accurate.
[1:37:35.000 --> 1:37:36.000]  But okay, fine.
[1:37:36.000 --> 1:37:37.000]  I won't just have a hand.
[1:37:37.000 --> 1:37:38.000]  Trust them.
[1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:39.000]  We're going to go to break a moment.
[1:37:39.000 --> 1:37:41.000]  I'm going to give you the floor to respond to this when we come back.
[1:37:41.000 --> 1:37:45.000]  But I was honest with everybody around my office.
[1:37:45.000 --> 1:37:48.000]  And I'm not an informant like Henry K.
[1:37:48.000 --> 1:37:49.000]  Tario.
[1:37:49.000 --> 1:37:52.000]  But at the same time, I want to expose the federal forces that
[1:37:52.000 --> 1:37:53.000]  are involved in this.
[1:37:53.000 --> 1:37:57.000]  We identified Boogaloo's and we identified Proud Boys leading the
[1:37:57.000 --> 1:37:59.000]  attack on the capital with Antifa.
[1:37:59.000 --> 1:38:01.000]  And I'm now bringing all this out today.
[1:38:01.000 --> 1:38:03.000]  I was already intending to before this broke about Tario.
[1:38:03.000 --> 1:38:06.000]  So I don't think we have the footage.
[1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:09.000]  So no Boogaloo's when the capital.
[1:38:09.000 --> 1:38:12.000]  Put it up of a Boogaloo boy walking into the capital.
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:14.000]  And I will have their faces covered.
[1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:17.000]  But I mean, well, we got you saying you have fire teams inside the
[1:38:17.000 --> 1:38:19.000]  capital, but I'm going to ask you right now.
[1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:20.000]  Building.
[1:38:20.000 --> 1:38:22.000]  You said we're inside the capital.
[1:38:22.000 --> 1:38:24.000]  You said that doesn't mean what you said.
[1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:26.000]  DC is the capital, not the capital building.
[1:38:26.000 --> 1:38:27.000]  Capital building.
[1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:28.000]  DC is the capital.
[1:38:28.000 --> 1:38:29.000]  Oh, OK.
[1:38:29.000 --> 1:38:30.000]  OK.
[1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:31.000]  Well, here's the deal.
[1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:33.000]  We're going to find out who these guys were in camo that had
[1:38:33.000 --> 1:38:34.000]  masks on.
[1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:37.000]  And we think they worked for the FBI.
[1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:38.000]  OK.
[1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:41.000]  Because our president that really got elected is on trial in a
[1:38:41.000 --> 1:38:42.000]  week and a half.
[1:38:42.000 --> 1:38:43.000]  And we're pissed off about it.
[1:38:43.000 --> 1:38:44.000]  OK.
[1:38:44.000 --> 1:38:46.000]  And we wanted to put peaceful pressure on them to show our
[1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:47.000]  numbers.
[1:38:47.000 --> 1:38:48.000]  And we got screwed over by some people.
[1:38:48.000 --> 1:38:49.000]  We're going to find out who they are.
[1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:52.000]  And if you could show us, it's not the booze.
[1:38:52.000 --> 1:38:53.000]  The best product.
[1:38:53.000 --> 1:38:55.000]  I'm not supposed to be biased, but I'm going to tell you all now.
[1:38:55.000 --> 1:38:57.000]  If you haven't tried Turbo Force, you need to try it.
[1:38:57.000 --> 1:38:59.000]  I've tried Turbo Force with everything.
[1:38:59.000 --> 1:39:01.000]  Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy.
[1:39:01.000 --> 1:39:03.000]  I put Turbo Force in my coffee.
[1:39:03.000 --> 1:39:04.000]  That was a crazy week.
[1:39:04.000 --> 1:39:05.000]  I don't remember sleeping.
[1:39:05.000 --> 1:39:07.000]  But as far as the products go, Turbo Force is my favorite.
[1:39:07.000 --> 1:39:10.000]  And all the Infowars products are down to taking control of your
[1:39:10.000 --> 1:39:13.000]  life, taking control of your health, not relying on other
[1:39:13.000 --> 1:39:15.000]  people to do it for you.
[1:39:15.000 --> 1:39:18.000]  Nobody wakes up in the morning and thinks, I'm going to give that
[1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:20.000]  person over there a better life.
[1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:21.000]  I'm going to wake up today.
[1:39:21.000 --> 1:39:22.000]  You know what?
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:24.000]  I'm going to spend my entire day trying to make that guy over
[1:39:24.000 --> 1:39:26.000]  there healthier, happier, and richer.
[1:39:26.000 --> 1:39:28.000]  I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend.
[1:39:28.000 --> 1:39:29.000]  I don't think that happens very often.
[1:39:29.000 --> 1:39:30.000]  It's never happened to me.
[1:39:30.000 --> 1:39:32.000]  I've never had anyone knock on my door and said, Tate, you're
[1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:33.000]  such a good guy.
[1:39:33.000 --> 1:39:35.000]  How can I improve your life in every single way?
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:37.000]  There's only one person who woke up and fought that.
[1:39:37.000 --> 1:39:38.000]  And that was me.
[1:39:38.000 --> 1:39:39.000]  I woke up and fought.
[1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:40.000]  You know what?
[1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:41.000]  Okay, I want to take control of my life.
[1:39:41.000 --> 1:39:42.000]  I want to take control of my health.
[1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:43.000]  And that's why you need to go to Infowars.com.
[1:39:43.000 --> 1:39:45.000]  Take control of your health right now and support the resistance.
[1:39:45.000 --> 1:39:48.000]  Don't buy into the group think, don't drink the Kool-Aid.
[1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:49.000]  Drink the turbo force.
[1:39:49.000 --> 1:39:51.000]  Kool-Aid's bad and the turbo force is good.
[1:39:51.000 --> 1:39:56.000]  Anybody listening to my voice and simply searching in the term, Davos Group,
[1:39:56.000 --> 1:40:02.000]  Technocracy, we're technocrats, you will get Klaus Schwab and
[1:40:02.000 --> 1:40:08.000]  John Codd, Junker, and all the new order globalists like Gigi Pink saying that
[1:40:08.000 --> 1:40:12.000]  they no longer want elected leaders over governments, that they want
[1:40:12.000 --> 1:40:15.000]  businessmen, technocrats over them.
[1:40:15.000 --> 1:40:16.000]  And that's who Klaus Schwab is.
[1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:19.000]  You might want to look into the guy that says they've launched the COVID-19
[1:40:19.000 --> 1:40:21.000]  lockdowns to bankrupt you and make you poor.
[1:40:21.000 --> 1:40:24.000]  You might want to find out who this super villain is.
[1:40:24.000 --> 1:40:28.000]  But you see, he believes because he's hidden playing you and you're not
[1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:30.000]  speaking out against it that he has the right to do it to you.
[1:40:30.000 --> 1:40:32.000]  You might want to find out who he works for.
[1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:34.000]  He works directly for Prince Charles.
[1:40:34.000 --> 1:40:38.000]  He developed, since the 80s, the plan for global sustainability.
[1:40:38.000 --> 1:40:42.000]  That means worldwide neo feudalists in his own words.
[1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:46.000]  So you might want to find out how he talks about using vaccine for sterilization
[1:40:46.000 --> 1:40:47.000]  before you take those shots.
[1:40:47.000 --> 1:40:50.000]  You might just want to find out who this villain is.
[1:40:50.000 --> 1:40:53.000]  All right.
[1:40:53.000 --> 1:40:58.000]  Our activated charcoal toothpaste became a best seller overnight because
[1:40:58.000 --> 1:41:01.000]  activated charcoal is already one of the top selling fastest growing
[1:41:01.000 --> 1:41:02.000]  toothpaste out there.
[1:41:02.000 --> 1:41:06.000]  The problem is a lot of the other over-the-counter ones have aspartame as
[1:41:06.000 --> 1:41:08.000]  they're flavoring very, very toxic.
[1:41:08.000 --> 1:41:10.000]  And also they have fluoride in it.
[1:41:10.000 --> 1:41:11.000]  This does not have the fluoride.
[1:41:11.000 --> 1:41:12.000]  It doesn't have the additives.
[1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:15.000]  This is a concentrated, really is high quality.
[1:41:15.000 --> 1:41:18.000]  It's been sold out for months because of supply chain breakdowns with the
[1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:20.000]  whole COVID martial law garbage.
[1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:22.000]  But now it's back in stock.
[1:41:22.000 --> 1:41:26.000]  Info Wars, Dr. Jones Naturals, activated charcoal toothpaste.

[1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:42.000]  Activated charcoal from Dr. Jones Naturals.
[1:41:42.000 --> 1:41:45.000]  Available again at infowarsstore.com.
[1:41:45.000 --> 1:41:48.000]  And a lot of other products that have been sold out have just now come back in
[1:41:48.000 --> 1:41:50.000]  as well, like pollen block.
[1:41:50.000 --> 1:42:02.000]  So check that out when you're in the store.
[1:42:21.000 --> 1:42:25.000]  And of course, that's just one of the great ways you can support Info Wars here.
[1:42:25.000 --> 1:42:28.000]  Everybody drinks coffee or just about everybody.
[1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:32.000]  Why not support Info Wars and keep the coffee supply at your house with the
[1:42:32.000 --> 1:42:34.000]  Wake Up America Patriot Blend.
[1:42:34.000 --> 1:42:35.000]  Of course, read all the great reviews.
[1:42:35.000 --> 1:42:37.000]  Pretty much perfect review there.
[1:42:37.000 --> 1:42:38.000]  4.9 star.
[1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:41.000]  When you have thousands of reviews, it's impossible to have a perfect review
[1:42:41.000 --> 1:42:43.000]  unless literally everybody gives it five stars.
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:46.000]  So I mean, if you have 4.9, that's pretty much everybody who gives it five
[1:42:46.000 --> 1:42:50.000]  stars that maybe one or two people.
[1:42:50.000 --> 1:42:55.000]  Patriot Blend 100% organic coffee only available at infowarsstore.com.
[1:42:55.000 --> 1:43:11.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:43:11.000 --> 1:43:13.000]  And we are back.
[1:43:13.000 --> 1:43:17.000]  Alex Jones and I'm about to do something with my 100 plus crew, all the Democrat
[1:43:17.000 --> 1:43:21.000]  lawsuits and our satellites and our own infrastructure, our own servers, parlors
[1:43:21.000 --> 1:43:23.000]  shut down, telegram shut, you know, they're shutting everything down.
[1:43:23.000 --> 1:43:26.000]  We're only air on air because of you.
[1:43:26.000 --> 1:43:28.000]  And you know, we've had big sales for months.
[1:43:28.000 --> 1:43:30.000]  We sold out of so many products.
[1:43:30.000 --> 1:43:34.000]  We have liquid turmeric extract discounted.
[1:43:34.000 --> 1:43:37.000]  We're down to 1000 bottles as 100% reviews.
[1:43:37.000 --> 1:43:39.000]  It's an amazing high quality product.
[1:43:39.000 --> 1:43:42.000]  It's different than bodies that is an ultimate turmeric formula.
[1:43:42.000 --> 1:43:44.000]  This is your humanoid extract.
[1:43:44.000 --> 1:43:46.000]  This is a natural concentrated extract.
[1:43:46.000 --> 1:43:48.000]  They go together like a horse and carriage.
[1:43:48.000 --> 1:43:53.000]  It is discounted right now, but it is selling out today.
[1:43:53.000 --> 1:43:57.000]  Also, X2 is a deep earth crystal pure iodine.
[1:43:57.000 --> 1:44:01.000]  We have to get a DEA license at our manufacturer in Arizona.
[1:44:01.000 --> 1:44:03.000]  It's literally locked up because, you know, it's a precursor.
[1:44:03.000 --> 1:44:06.000]  Everybody's, you know, seen Breaking Bad.
[1:44:06.000 --> 1:44:08.000]  But it's so good for your body.
[1:44:08.000 --> 1:44:10.000]  It's a precursor to everything.
[1:44:10.000 --> 1:44:14.000]  It is 50% off, but that sale has to end in a couple of days
[1:44:14.000 --> 1:44:17.000]  because we're down to like 2000 bottles.
[1:44:17.000 --> 1:44:20.000]  And we're not getting more for six weeks
[1:44:20.000 --> 1:44:22.000]  because of supply chain breakdown.
[1:44:22.000 --> 1:44:26.000]  So get your survival show next to 50% off right now
[1:44:26.000 --> 1:44:28.000]  at M4store.com.
[1:44:28.000 --> 1:44:31.000]  And yes, it's on pre-order, but it's being printed in Texas,
[1:44:31.000 --> 1:44:34.000]  outside Austin, in Georgetown,
[1:44:34.000 --> 1:44:37.000]  by the great veterans that run the company,
[1:44:37.000 --> 1:44:40.000]  Joe Biden, Trader Joe's shirt.
[1:44:40.000 --> 1:44:42.000]  Like, you know, the Trader Joe's grocery store,
[1:44:42.000 --> 1:44:43.000]  but it shows all the countries he sold out to.
[1:44:43.000 --> 1:44:48.000]  Iran, China, Russia, you name it.
[1:44:48.000 --> 1:44:49.000]  It's a great shirt.
[1:44:49.000 --> 1:44:50.000]  I thought it'd be a best seller.
[1:44:50.000 --> 1:44:51.000]  It is a best seller.
[1:44:51.000 --> 1:44:53.000]  And the problem is we only printed a couple of thousand.
[1:44:53.000 --> 1:44:55.000]  They sold out instantly.
[1:44:55.000 --> 1:44:56.000]  Well, we got more coming in next week.
[1:44:56.000 --> 1:44:58.000]  So get your orders in right now for Trader Joe's t-shirts
[1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:02.000]  M4store.com takes a lot of money to keep this show on air.
[1:45:02.000 --> 1:45:04.000]  Everybody else is being shut down.
[1:45:04.000 --> 1:45:06.000]  All the ecosystems are being shut down.
[1:45:06.000 --> 1:45:09.000]  So we're going to thank you again for your financial support
[1:45:09.000 --> 1:45:11.000]  at M4store.com.

[1:45:19.000 --> 1:45:21.000]  We throw a lot of those in for free, by the way,
[1:45:21.000 --> 1:45:23.000]  in the packaging and so much more.

[1:45:32.000 --> 1:45:34.000]  And I got to tell you, we'll have some limited stuff on sale,
[1:45:34.000 --> 1:45:36.000]  but not some for a while.
[1:45:36.000 --> 1:45:40.000]  We also have the FK Biden.
[1:45:40.000 --> 1:45:42.000]  I like New York license plate, so I chose that.
[1:45:42.000 --> 1:45:46.000]  FK license plate t-shirt, those are very popular for the winter.
[1:45:46.000 --> 1:45:49.000]  It's long sleeve, kind of the football style jersey
[1:45:49.000 --> 1:45:50.000]  or hockey jersey.
[1:45:50.000 --> 1:45:52.000]  It's all at M4store.com.
[1:45:52.000 --> 1:45:53.000]  I want to thank you all for keeping us on the air.
[1:45:53.000 --> 1:45:55.000]  This is a war and we salute you.
[1:45:55.000 --> 1:45:56.000]  All right, back to Mike Dunn.
[1:45:56.000 --> 1:45:59.000]  And we got Roman Troyer riding shotgun in the studio.
[1:45:59.000 --> 1:46:02.000]  And Pete Santilli wants to pop in saying he's been set up
[1:46:02.000 --> 1:46:04.000]  like this before.
[1:46:04.000 --> 1:46:06.000]  Looks like Cohen Telpro, what they're doing to Enrique Tario.
[1:46:06.000 --> 1:46:07.000]  I like it.
[1:46:07.000 --> 1:46:08.000]  He's a nice guy.
[1:46:08.000 --> 1:46:09.000]  We're saying he's a federal informant.
[1:46:09.000 --> 1:46:10.000]  We'll talk about all that.
[1:46:10.000 --> 1:46:12.000]  But for new listeners tuning in,
[1:46:12.000 --> 1:46:13.000]  we've gone under world government.
[1:46:13.000 --> 1:46:14.000]  We're fighting back.
[1:46:14.000 --> 1:46:16.000]  We're trying to find out who the provocateur groups are.
[1:46:16.000 --> 1:46:18.000]  And I'll just say it, and I've said this.
[1:46:18.000 --> 1:46:20.000]  I'm not against the Proud Boys.
[1:46:20.000 --> 1:46:21.000]  They've been lying about it.
[1:46:21.000 --> 1:46:23.000]  I don't think they're racist, all the other stuff.
[1:46:23.000 --> 1:46:25.000]  We know that we're Proud Boys not wearing their outfits,
[1:46:25.000 --> 1:46:28.000]  not wearing their uniforms, that we're part of the capital breach.
[1:46:28.000 --> 1:46:31.000]  We have tweets by you and by other people saying,
[1:46:31.000 --> 1:46:33.000]  they supported the capital attack.
[1:46:33.000 --> 1:46:34.000]  And then it was a great day.
[1:46:34.000 --> 1:46:36.000]  Now you're kind of halfway back and off of that.
[1:46:36.000 --> 1:46:38.000]  I'm not here trying to get you arrested.
[1:46:38.000 --> 1:46:43.000]  My big question is, I see this Dr. Gold lady just going in
[1:46:43.000 --> 1:46:44.000]  being arrested.
[1:46:44.000 --> 1:46:50.000]  I see Brandon Straca, or Strach being arrested when he was just
[1:46:50.000 --> 1:46:51.000]  there doing nothing.
[1:46:51.000 --> 1:46:53.000]  And then it freaks me out.
[1:46:53.000 --> 1:46:56.000]  It's like, who are the men in uniforms with masks handing out
[1:46:56.000 --> 1:46:58.000]  clubs saying attack, attack, attack?
[1:46:58.000 --> 1:47:00.000]  That's my big question.
[1:47:00.000 --> 1:47:05.000]  Because I've seen the 1990s, 2000s militia movement where I would
[1:47:05.000 --> 1:47:08.000]  be in a shooting range and have feds come over and say,
[1:47:08.000 --> 1:47:09.000]  hey, let's blow up a federal building.
[1:47:09.000 --> 1:47:11.000]  And I'd go out and videotape their car.
[1:47:11.000 --> 1:47:13.000]  And it was a unmarked federal police, federal car.
[1:47:13.000 --> 1:47:16.000]  I mean, that's a giant template they've used.
[1:47:16.000 --> 1:47:20.000]  So you can see, Mike Dunn, where I'm a little concerned and I see
[1:47:20.000 --> 1:47:23.000]  this going on, and I'm worried about the idea of your movement
[1:47:23.000 --> 1:47:25.000]  that anybody can say they're a boogaloo.
[1:47:25.000 --> 1:47:26.000]  It's like, are you for anonymous?
[1:47:26.000 --> 1:47:27.000]  Well, anybody can be anonymous.
[1:47:27.000 --> 1:47:28.000]  Are you for Q?
[1:47:28.000 --> 1:47:29.000]  Anybody can be for Q.
[1:47:29.000 --> 1:47:33.000]  I mean, don't you worry that I'm going to stop ranting here.
[1:47:33.000 --> 1:47:35.000]  But explain to me, boogaloo, where it came from.
[1:47:35.000 --> 1:47:37.000]  Are you worried about being taken over?
[1:47:37.000 --> 1:47:40.000]  I mean, what do you think's really happening here?
[1:47:40.000 --> 1:47:44.000]  Since boogaloo is an ideology, it's not necessarily a worry
[1:47:44.000 --> 1:47:46.000]  of being taken over because if somebody doesn't embody the
[1:47:46.000 --> 1:47:48.000]  ideology, then they're not boogaloo.
[1:47:48.000 --> 1:47:52.000]  Boogaloo started as a meme, a joke back in like 2012.
[1:47:52.000 --> 1:47:53.000]  It was just an online joke.
[1:47:53.000 --> 1:47:57.000]  And then in 2019, several people started making a little more
[1:47:57.000 --> 1:48:00.000]  public and actually turning it to an ideology or belief that
[1:48:00.000 --> 1:48:03.000]  liberty is for all and we're done being treadmill.
[1:48:03.000 --> 1:48:06.000]  We're done going the old ways of crying and begging on our knees
[1:48:06.000 --> 1:48:10.000]  for the courts that are already screwed up to help us.
[1:48:10.000 --> 1:48:13.000]  We're tired of trying to vote our way out of a system that is
[1:48:13.000 --> 1:48:17.000]  controlled, that is controlled by the globalists that you speak
[1:48:17.000 --> 1:48:18.000]  of.
[1:48:18.000 --> 1:48:19.000]  We're tired of it.
[1:48:19.000 --> 1:48:21.000]  And we stood up 2019.
[1:48:21.000 --> 1:48:24.000]  And then in early 2020, Duncan Lipp, who was a boogaloo boy,
[1:48:24.000 --> 1:48:27.000]  was killed in his home as they started a red flag on him saying
[1:48:27.000 --> 1:48:28.000]  that he was a risk.
[1:48:28.000 --> 1:48:33.000]  21 years old, a buddy of mine, was murdered in his bed because
[1:48:33.000 --> 1:48:34.000]  he had firearm.
[1:48:34.000 --> 1:48:37.000]  And that sparked the boogaloo movement nationwide.
[1:48:37.000 --> 1:48:40.000]  A lot of us started taking two streets and saying, you know what?
[1:48:40.000 --> 1:48:42.000]  We're done hiding behind computer screens.
[1:48:42.000 --> 1:48:44.000]  We're done talking.
[1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:45.000]  We're done doing all of this.
[1:48:45.000 --> 1:48:47.000]  We're going to go out there and take a stand.
[1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:51.000]  And if they want as horrible as war is, if they want a war,
[1:48:51.000 --> 1:48:54.000]  let it begin with us because our fathers didn't know phantallics
[1:48:54.000 --> 1:48:56.000]  for your generation thing.
[1:48:56.000 --> 1:48:58.000]  And so our children don't have to.
[1:48:58.000 --> 1:49:00.000]  We're going to stand up now and say, this is it.
[1:49:00.000 --> 1:49:01.000]  We're done with it.
[1:49:01.000 --> 1:49:02.000]  Sure, sure.
[1:49:02.000 --> 1:49:03.000]  It's like we'll see what's going to go.
[1:49:03.000 --> 1:49:04.000]  You haven't been in the military.
[1:49:04.000 --> 1:49:05.000]  Have you?
[1:49:05.000 --> 1:49:06.000]  So trust the plan.
[1:49:06.000 --> 1:49:09.000]  Look, look, here's my issue.
[1:49:09.000 --> 1:49:12.000]  Are you guys putting on a manifesto of targets?
[1:49:12.000 --> 1:49:17.000]  Because, you know, random police, capitals, that's, I mean,
[1:49:17.000 --> 1:49:20.000]  that's just a seat of what the people should be in control of.
[1:49:20.000 --> 1:49:22.000]  I mean, I'm not calling for targets, God forbid.
[1:49:22.000 --> 1:49:23.000]  I don't want any violence.
[1:49:23.000 --> 1:49:24.000]  What about Bill Gates?
[1:49:24.000 --> 1:49:26.000]  What about Ted Turner?
[1:49:26.000 --> 1:49:28.000]  What people going to put poison vaccines in us?
[1:49:28.000 --> 1:49:29.000]  What about the UN?
[1:49:29.000 --> 1:49:32.000]  So tell me, tell me in a deck of cards like Saddam Hussein
[1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:35.000]  was the top target, 2003, like who's the ace of spades
[1:49:35.000 --> 1:49:37.000]  for you guys?
[1:49:37.000 --> 1:49:40.000]  It would be ignorant to sit here and release a manifesto
[1:49:40.000 --> 1:49:41.000]  or say this is a target.
[1:49:41.000 --> 1:49:42.000]  Yeah.
[1:49:42.000 --> 1:49:45.000]  So let's not mention any real evil kingpins, right?
[1:49:45.000 --> 1:49:48.000]  I had to say something like that.
[1:49:48.000 --> 1:49:50.000]  Say that again.
[1:49:50.000 --> 1:49:52.000]  I'm not going to allow you to build me into saying something
[1:49:52.000 --> 1:49:53.000]  like that.
[1:49:53.000 --> 1:49:54.000]  That would be ridiculous.
[1:49:54.000 --> 1:49:57.000]  Oh, like the Southern Poverty Law Center does, posing as militias,
[1:49:57.000 --> 1:49:58.000]  goading people into stuff?
[1:49:58.000 --> 1:50:00.000]  Maybe you're standing up.
[1:50:00.000 --> 1:50:01.000]  Oh, maybe.
[1:50:01.000 --> 1:50:03.000]  Oh, maybe I am.
[1:50:03.000 --> 1:50:04.000]  Maybe you're right.
[1:50:04.000 --> 1:50:09.000]  Listen, what I'm telling you is I want to save this country.
[1:50:09.000 --> 1:50:13.000]  And running around storming capitals is not the way to do it.
[1:50:13.000 --> 1:50:14.000]  The courts are not.
[1:50:14.000 --> 1:50:15.000]  Alex, the country is not safe.
[1:50:15.000 --> 1:50:16.000]  Let me ask you a question.
[1:50:16.000 --> 1:50:19.000]  Do you have 50 Democratic lawsuits against you?
[1:50:19.000 --> 1:50:21.000]  What second?
[1:50:21.000 --> 1:50:26.000]  Do you have the Democratic Party financing your destruction like I do?
[1:50:26.000 --> 1:50:29.000]  I don't know nor do I care.
[1:50:29.000 --> 1:50:30.000]  No, I'm asking.
[1:50:30.000 --> 1:50:32.000]  See, see, why am I under so much attack?
[1:50:32.000 --> 1:50:33.000]  Because I know nothing.
[1:50:33.000 --> 1:50:34.000]  I'm this coward.
[1:50:34.000 --> 1:50:35.000]  I've sat on the sidelines.
[1:50:35.000 --> 1:50:36.000]  I've never done anything.
[1:50:36.000 --> 1:50:38.000]  And you're this because you walk around with a gun.
[1:50:38.000 --> 1:50:41.000]  It's like, oh my God, just I'm supposed to fall down on my knees
[1:50:41.000 --> 1:50:43.000]  and like, holy hell, this is my leader.
[1:50:43.000 --> 1:50:45.000]  I mean, seriously, dude, you keep telling me that I stood down.
[1:50:45.000 --> 1:50:47.000]  You said my generation stood down.
[1:50:47.000 --> 1:50:48.000]  Bull.
[1:50:48.000 --> 1:50:50.000]  My generation didn't stand down.
[1:50:50.000 --> 1:50:53.000]  It's the fact that you're doing the same thing that's been done for years.
[1:50:53.000 --> 1:50:55.000]  And it's not accomplishing anything.
[1:50:55.000 --> 1:50:58.000]  The only thing that's going to accomplish is forcing a revolution.
[1:50:58.000 --> 1:51:00.000]  I am not doing the same thing.
[1:51:00.000 --> 1:51:01.000]  I'm not Democrat Republican.
[1:51:01.000 --> 1:51:03.000]  I'm exposing the globalist program.
[1:51:03.000 --> 1:51:05.000]  Do you understand that information is powerful?
[1:51:05.000 --> 1:51:06.000]  They're scared of it.
[1:51:06.000 --> 1:51:08.000]  You're talking that that's all you know.
[1:51:08.000 --> 1:51:11.000]  You're doing the same thing that's been done for years, brother.
[1:51:11.000 --> 1:51:15.000]  Oh, so, so now you are admitting you told people to storm the capital because you're,
[1:51:15.000 --> 1:51:16.000]  you're not like me a coward.
[1:51:16.000 --> 1:51:17.000]  You're a big man.
[1:51:17.000 --> 1:51:18.000]  You were for war.
[1:51:18.000 --> 1:51:20.000]  I have not told anybody to storm the capital.
[1:51:20.000 --> 1:51:22.000]  I preach revolution and I always will.
[1:51:22.000 --> 1:51:24.000]  Well, let's raise this.
[1:51:24.000 --> 1:51:28.000]  The Buchaloo Supreme leadership, whoever they are,
[1:51:28.000 --> 1:51:32.000]  said go to DC the weekend after the six and have our marches,
[1:51:32.000 --> 1:51:34.000]  but you guys didn't show up.
[1:51:34.000 --> 1:51:38.000]  So you were trying to get other people to come into DC and she could sit back and
[1:51:38.000 --> 1:51:41.000]  make popcorn and watch that, or was that not the Buchaloo's that said that?
[1:51:41.000 --> 1:51:43.000]  This is the word you like, Alex.
[1:51:43.000 --> 1:51:46.000]  It's called a sigh up, brother.
[1:51:46.000 --> 1:51:47.000]  Oh, a sigh up.
[1:51:47.000 --> 1:51:51.000]  So you're not going to respond to the stack of tweets I've got and messages from
[1:51:51.000 --> 1:51:56.000]  you saying we're going to have an arm march three days after the six.
[1:51:56.000 --> 1:51:59.000]  Yeah, like you're a liar.
[1:51:59.000 --> 1:52:00.000]  Show the tweet.
[1:52:00.000 --> 1:52:03.000]  We're going to have an arm march.
[1:52:03.000 --> 1:52:05.000]  So you know, so the Buchaloo's did not call.
[1:52:05.000 --> 1:52:07.000]  They didn't say arm march is still on for DC.
[1:52:07.000 --> 1:52:09.000]  We're going to have it.
[1:52:09.000 --> 1:52:12.000]  Show the tweet where I said there's going to be.
[1:52:12.000 --> 1:52:13.000]  I'm at the Buchaloo Lordship.
[1:52:13.000 --> 1:52:15.000]  Well, you said you're not the Lordship.
[1:52:15.000 --> 1:52:18.000]  I said I'm not the leader.
[1:52:18.000 --> 1:52:20.000]  Oh, so you don't have any problems or anything.
[1:52:20.000 --> 1:52:25.000]  Have you ever been to the the ADL or Southern probably Law Center headquarters?
[1:52:25.000 --> 1:52:26.000]  I don't care.
[1:52:26.000 --> 1:52:29.000]  I don't care to go to any of those places because I care less about it.
[1:52:29.000 --> 1:52:31.000]  I'm here to stand for when I believe every policy.
[1:52:31.000 --> 1:52:32.000]  Well, you're saying I'm a liar.
[1:52:32.000 --> 1:52:34.000]  I know I've got a stack of articles.
[1:52:34.000 --> 1:52:35.000]  Maybe they're wrong.
[1:52:35.000 --> 1:52:37.000]  And if I'm wrong, I'll say it.
[1:52:37.000 --> 1:52:39.000]  That the Buchaloo.
[1:52:39.000 --> 1:52:40.000]  No, no, no.
[1:52:40.000 --> 1:52:42.000]  You said you didn't say the book.
[1:52:42.000 --> 1:52:44.000]  You said you like back if you want to.
[1:52:44.000 --> 1:52:47.000]  You said you called for an arm march at DC.
[1:52:47.000 --> 1:52:48.000]  You I have to wait for it.
[1:52:48.000 --> 1:52:49.000]  He called for it.
[1:52:49.000 --> 1:52:50.000]  That's why I said you're a liar.
[1:52:50.000 --> 1:52:54.000]  So you've never called for arm marches against capital's period.
[1:52:54.000 --> 1:52:58.000]  I have said that no arm march in DC and an arm march in DC would be unwise.
[1:52:58.000 --> 1:53:00.000]  I said that repeatedly.
[1:53:00.000 --> 1:53:01.000]  Well, good, good for you.
[1:53:01.000 --> 1:53:02.000]  I read where the Buchaloo said that.
[1:53:02.000 --> 1:53:04.000]  So, so wait, I thought you're a man of action though.
[1:53:04.000 --> 1:53:06.000]  You just said that I'm the coward.
[1:53:06.000 --> 1:53:07.000]  You're the man of action.
[1:53:07.000 --> 1:53:08.000]  Wise action.
[1:53:08.000 --> 1:53:09.000]  Wise action.
[1:53:09.000 --> 1:53:10.000]  Wise action.
[1:53:10.000 --> 1:53:13.000]  I go to capitals where we can punk the police department, punk city, punk city.
[1:53:13.000 --> 1:53:16.000]  But you told me earlier that we should not follow the law.
[1:53:16.000 --> 1:53:17.000]  You said I'm a coward.
[1:53:17.000 --> 1:53:19.000]  I follow the law.
[1:53:19.000 --> 1:53:22.000]  You don't follow the law because you're for revolution.
[1:53:22.000 --> 1:53:23.000]  Correct.
[1:53:23.000 --> 1:53:24.000]  I am for revolution.
[1:53:24.000 --> 1:53:25.000]  I'm for wise revolution.
[1:53:25.000 --> 1:53:26.000]  Which is where we go to these capitals.
[1:53:26.000 --> 1:53:27.000]  We punk the PDs.
[1:53:27.000 --> 1:53:30.000]  We punk the city councils that want to make it unlawful cause.
[1:53:30.000 --> 1:53:31.000]  Unlawful.
[1:53:31.000 --> 1:53:32.000]  Yeah.
[1:53:32.000 --> 1:53:33.000]  Because the local cops are our issue.
[1:53:33.000 --> 1:53:34.000]  All right.
[1:53:34.000 --> 1:53:35.000]  All right.
[1:53:35.000 --> 1:53:36.000]  Hey, you are the Buchaloo lordship.
[1:53:36.000 --> 1:53:40.000]  We're going to come right back and you still are here with us.
[1:53:40.000 --> 1:53:45.000]  We have the technocrats are controlling the food supply.
[1:53:45.000 --> 1:53:48.000]  Secure your own safe source of food supply sale.
[1:53:48.000 --> 1:53:51.000]  It's the new prices in 2021, but it's the lowest price for high quality food.
[1:53:51.000 --> 1:53:53.000]  You're going to find at infowarstore.com.
[1:53:53.000 --> 1:53:57.000]  The subsection is prepared with alex.com and it's all these globalists do this.
[1:53:57.000 --> 1:54:02.000]  And as they hoard the food and as they prepare, you need to understand that you need 25 year
[1:54:02.000 --> 1:54:04.000]  food supply at the last 25 years.
[1:54:04.000 --> 1:54:06.000]  One month, three months, six months, one year supplies.
[1:54:06.000 --> 1:54:08.000]  And it's the highest quality you're going to find.
[1:54:08.000 --> 1:54:11.000]  And it's just good to have that check box taken care of.
[1:54:11.000 --> 1:54:13.000]  And you know you're getting good food at a very good price.
[1:54:13.000 --> 1:54:19.000]  And you know that a small percentage of it because there's not much profit in this goes to us to fund our operation.
[1:54:19.000 --> 1:54:22.000]  So prepare with alex.com or infowarstore.com.
[1:54:22.000 --> 1:54:24.000]  You can find preparing this section there.
[1:54:24.000 --> 1:54:25.000]  Water filtration, air filtration.
[1:54:25.000 --> 1:54:26.000]  It's all there.
[1:54:26.000 --> 1:54:29.000]  The technocrats are getting ready to bring in all the forced GMO and more.
[1:54:29.000 --> 1:54:32.000]  It's time to start getting prepared and it starts with self-defense.
[1:54:32.000 --> 1:54:33.000]  It starts with being prepared.
[1:54:33.000 --> 1:54:34.000]  It starts with horrible food.
[1:54:34.000 --> 1:54:37.000]  It starts with digging in with a long, globalist fight.
[1:54:37.000 --> 1:54:38.000]  You'll win in the end.
[1:54:42.000 --> 1:54:44.000]  You must guard your humanity.
[1:54:44.000 --> 1:54:47.000]  You must guard your children's humanity.
[1:54:47.000 --> 1:54:50.000]  You must guard the very genetic code of the planet.
[1:54:50.000 --> 1:54:54.000]  The globalists have set themselves up as the guardians of this world.
[1:54:54.000 --> 1:54:59.000]  But they are the ones that are overriding every genetic system and poison the planet.
[1:54:59.000 --> 1:55:06.000]  They are the ones that are now engaged in genetic takeover of every human on Earth to the GMO crops.
[1:55:06.000 --> 1:55:13.000]  And now they've moved on to their main target, to madden with the mRNA vaccines, which are not vaccines.
[1:55:13.000 --> 1:55:24.000]  They are recombinant DNA from aborted, cloned fetuses were then inserted into your genome to take over your body's systems.
[1:55:24.000 --> 1:55:31.000]  Go read the actual inserts for the mRNA vaccines and then remember you've been warned.
[1:55:31.000 --> 1:55:34.000]  This is the equivalent of an alien takeover.
[1:55:34.000 --> 1:55:40.000]  Whether it's interdimensional, whether it's little green men, the globalists are acting like another species that's overtaking us and overriding us.
[1:55:40.000 --> 1:55:44.000]  It's all the same in the end.
[1:55:44.000 --> 1:56:10.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:56:10.000 --> 1:56:14.000]  I'm not the founder. I'm not the leader. It's called a joke.
[1:56:14.000 --> 1:56:17.000]  But it's like Q or it's like anonymous.
[1:56:17.000 --> 1:56:22.000]  You never know who the leader is. It's an ideology. It's not our fault.
[1:56:22.000 --> 1:56:25.000]  Have any boogaloo's been arrested, Mike Dunn?
[1:56:25.000 --> 1:56:30.000]  I know now you're calling DC the capital. We've stormed the capital. We're in command.
[1:56:30.000 --> 1:56:33.000]  You mean you're in DC with fire teams.
[1:56:33.000 --> 1:56:37.000]  But if DC doesn't allow you to have guns, you just said you won't violate laws.
[1:56:37.000 --> 1:56:43.000]  I'm a wimp. I don't violate laws. I'm a wimp. I don't violate laws, but you don't want to violate laws.
[1:56:43.000 --> 1:56:45.000]  We're going to be smart about violating laws.
[1:56:45.000 --> 1:56:48.000]  And then you were in the capital, but you weren't in the capital with these fire teams.
[1:56:48.000 --> 1:56:53.000]  But explain it to me because I'm an honest man. It's hard to con an honest man.
[1:56:53.000 --> 1:56:59.000]  It's literally capital as in DC. Nobody said anything about the capital building.
[1:56:59.000 --> 1:57:06.000]  Number one, number two, no boogaloo boy attends a protest unarmed so you can answer your, you can fill in your imaginations as well.
[1:57:06.000 --> 1:57:16.000]  What I said was I would not encourage an unarmed bar to hold DC, which is what I've said repeatedly because I find it a poor tactical plan, a poor strategy.
[1:57:16.000 --> 1:57:24.000]  So I know you're going things out of proportion and trying to pay me as the bad guy or pay me as illogical, but I've been consistent with what I'm saying.
[1:57:24.000 --> 1:57:26.000]  You just, you keep trying to twist it out, man.
[1:57:26.000 --> 1:57:32.000]  No, Mike. I'm trying to find out who the guys in camo are that lead the attack with Antifa and then get a few, maybe 180.
[1:57:32.000 --> 1:57:37.000]  It's to go on with them so that, so that they can destroy a peaceful movement.
[1:57:37.000 --> 1:57:42.000]  Looks around quite a few Antifa. You know, there are, there are some Antifa that are good.
[1:57:42.000 --> 1:57:46.000]  The majority we've not had good interactions with. We do not support, but there are some that are good.
[1:57:46.000 --> 1:57:53.000]  But I've interacted with a lot of Antifa and I can assure you that they were not Antifa that were on that front line in that capital, that capital right.
[1:57:53.000 --> 1:57:59.000]  So trying to find somebody to point fingers at your failing when you're pointing at Antifa, they were not there.
[1:57:59.000 --> 1:58:03.000]  Oh, I'm failing even though they arrested an Antifa leader that said he brought a hundred there.
[1:58:03.000 --> 1:58:08.000]  I saw a bunch of skinny Jean guys helping do it. Oh, so this was all Trump people.
[1:58:08.000 --> 1:58:13.000]  Yeah, it's, it's called, it's called an op, Alex. The same thing that you preach about.
[1:58:13.000 --> 1:58:14.000]  What's an op?
[1:58:14.000 --> 1:58:21.000]  It's not, it's not, it's simply not true.
[1:58:21.000 --> 1:58:26.000]  Oh, so, okay. So should Trump be arrested for inciting this?
[1:58:26.000 --> 1:58:30.000]  I think there are a lot of other crops that Trump should be arrested for. I don't believe he incited the insurrection at the Capitol.
[1:58:30.000 --> 1:58:35.000]  No, but I believe there's a lot of other crimes he should be arrested for.
[1:58:35.000 --> 1:58:40.000]  So have you ever met, have you ever talked to Southern Primary Law Center?
[1:58:40.000 --> 1:58:49.000]  Uh, I don't think so. Maybe I talked to a lot of people. A lot of people call me ask questions, reporters, agencies. I have no clue.
[1:58:49.000 --> 1:58:54.000]  Oh, and you want to put any bookends on this? I mean, I just, this is just a mess.
[1:58:54.000 --> 1:58:59.000]  Yeah, here's the deal. I think we're obsessing a little bit too much over January 6th.
[1:58:59.000 --> 1:59:03.000]  You had Democrat riots, $2.2 billion in property damage.
[1:59:03.000 --> 1:59:06.000]  Most of it, if not all of it, private businesses, aside from maybe a couple of government entities.
[1:59:06.000 --> 1:59:11.000]  I know there was a police station in Seattle and that barely gets scolded by the media.
[1:59:11.000 --> 1:59:16.000]  So here's the problem. We are not in a position to launch any sort of kinetic war.
[1:59:16.000 --> 1:59:22.000]  Most of the population in America doesn't have a clue what's going on and the media will turn them against you as soon as you do that.
[1:59:22.000 --> 1:59:25.000]  January 6th is the perfect example. So here's my problem.
[1:59:25.000 --> 1:59:30.000]  We are now out of the age of the Trump presidency. The polarization of that is done.
[1:59:30.000 --> 1:59:37.000]  I couldn't go interact or interface with BLM or Antifa without being attacked, them calling me racist, all this stuff because I support Trump.
[1:59:37.000 --> 1:59:40.000]  Oh, I'm a Nazi. Well, I'm not. I never was any of that stuff.
[1:59:40.000 --> 1:59:43.000]  So now I'm saying we all need to be unified. We're all anti-establishment.
[1:59:43.000 --> 1:59:47.000]  I think we can all agree the media is corrupt. We can all agree politicians are corrupt.
[1:59:47.000 --> 1:59:54.000]  We have to become unified so we can organize against the wars, against the surveillance, against the mask, against the forced inoculation.
[1:59:54.000 --> 2:00:00.000]  I think that's a positive thing. Let me ask Lord Guglielud. Do you agree with that, Lord Guglielud?
[2:00:00.000 --> 2:00:06.000]  So I'm 100% clear. You're cool with the tyranny if it's the tyranny that you like, which would be Donald Trump.
[2:00:06.000 --> 2:00:11.000]  I just want to make sure I'm tracking on that. So you're not actually against tyranny. You're not actually for a revolution.
[2:00:11.000 --> 2:00:15.000]  You're only for when somebody is in office that you don't agree with.
[2:00:15.000 --> 2:00:20.000]  Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I just talked about all of us unifying against forced inoculations. Joe Biden, Trump's gone.
[2:00:20.000 --> 2:00:25.000]  You wouldn't do it. You wouldn't do it on Trump's office because you didn't stand against Trump. You stood for the very time.
[2:00:25.000 --> 2:00:34.000]  I didn't stand around with a gun in front of stuff. Hold on. That's another cheap shot, Mr. Fire Team.
[2:00:34.000 --> 2:00:41.000]  We have fire teams in the Capitol. We have taken the Capitol. We are command-based Delta.
[2:00:41.000 --> 2:00:46.000]  Come on. Don't get mad, Mr. Dunn. We're back in 60 seconds.
[2:00:46.000 --> 2:01:12.000]  I'll tell you.
[2:01:16.000 --> 2:01:45.000]  We're back in 60 seconds.
[2:01:45.000 --> 2:01:47.000]  Share the link.
[2:02:15.000 --> 2:02:29.000]  All right. We got Mike Dunn, one of the most prominent boogaloo's with us.
[2:02:29.000 --> 2:02:35.000]  And again, he goes, oh, you sell products. You're discredited. That sounds like a communist statement.
[2:02:35.000 --> 2:02:39.000]  And then he, oh, we've got security for BLM, but we don't like the Proud Boys.
[2:02:39.000 --> 2:02:45.000]  And so he does these cheap shots. I was pretty nice to him earlier. I brought up some of his quotes and some of the things he said.
[2:02:45.000 --> 2:02:50.000]  And then I was simply, you know, coming out and saying, I don't think the attack on the Capitol was good.
[2:02:50.000 --> 2:02:57.000]  He overall, I think, agreed with that, but then, you know, came back that I'm just not willing to get my hands dirty because I'm a coward.
[2:02:57.000 --> 2:03:03.000]  But he said he doesn't support a Capitol attack because there's a law, you know, against guns in D.C.
[2:03:03.000 --> 2:03:09.000]  But then he kind of said that, so that I was causing a problem.
[2:03:09.000 --> 2:03:15.000]  So I just wanted you to have some final comments. Hey, dude, if you're going to talk, close that door, thanks.
[2:03:15.000 --> 2:03:21.000]  So that's where we are. Listen, I don't have a hard on for the boogaloo's.
[2:03:21.000 --> 2:03:29.000]  I'm not against people doing open carry. I think it's a good idea to exercise our First Amendment or Second Amendment both together at the same time.
[2:03:29.000 --> 2:03:41.000]  It's just that I really don't think a badly coordinated sporadic shooting war with the local police is going to really put our revolution off on a good foot.
[2:03:41.000 --> 2:03:51.000]  And I know you're going to say that's not what you're part of. It's just I'm simply here asking if there were boogaloo's at the Capitol that day and boogaloo's are telling us they're leading the way for revolution.
[2:03:51.000 --> 2:04:00.000]  You can't have it both ways. Like, were they leading the revolution in there as the tweets should be seen as or were they not leading it? And now they're not following the ideology they said they're part of.
[2:04:00.000 --> 2:04:06.000]  I would like to respond to what Owen said before the break this time. Yes, Lord Boogaloo. Go ahead.
[2:04:06.000 --> 2:04:16.000]  You're awesome. So basically, Owen was talking about, Owen, could you could you refresh that because now I just lost my train of thought?
[2:04:16.000 --> 2:04:23.000]  Well, let me just be clear. You were saying, oh, you only have the title of Lord Boogaloo. Well, let me just be clear. You were saying, oh, you only support it when your guy's not in office.
[2:04:23.000 --> 2:04:33.000]  It's not that. But let me be clear. It's not that. I believe that Trump was hoped that we could do it peacefully. I believe that Trump was hoped that we could do it politically from within.
[2:04:33.000 --> 2:04:42.000]  He's out now. So that hope's gone. So that's what I'm saying. Now we're in a new age. We should all be unifying, having real intellectual debates about what a revolution looks like to save this country.
[2:04:42.000 --> 2:04:50.000]  Yeah. What was the Trump fascism? Like Trump's gone. It's like, you support Trump and his police state. What the hell does that mean?
[2:04:50.000 --> 2:05:00.000]  Oh, and until you vote, you vote somebody else in that continues to do the same thing while saying, hey, we're against voter fraud, but then actually for taking in the very system that continues to destroy the U.S.
[2:05:00.000 --> 2:05:10.000]  and the freedoms that we hold so dear. So the problem is, Owen, and it's the same thing I've seen with Republicans across the border, people who identify as conservative or white being.
[2:05:10.000 --> 2:05:21.000]  Is that you're all for unity when it fits your idea? You're all for all this ally with Black Lives Matter. Let's be friends with Black Lives Matter because we kind of stand against the government because Joe Biden's in office and his administration controls.
[2:05:21.000 --> 2:05:24.000]  Where was that unity when Trump and friends upon the second important?
[2:05:24.000 --> 2:05:30.000]  But that's not fair, though. That's not fair. I didn't work with Black Lives Matter. You did, Boogie Lou.
[2:05:30.000 --> 2:05:38.000]  Mike, that's not fair. I had nothing against these groups. I'm telling you, I would go out to try to talk to them. I'm on video hours of video where I try to talk to them.
[2:05:38.000 --> 2:05:44.000]  They call me a Nazi. They call me racist. So, I mean, what am I supposed to do? I did try the unity when Trump was in office.
[2:05:44.000 --> 2:05:49.000]  Hey, Owen, they've called me the same thing. It's all the way portray yourself and how do you...
[2:05:49.000 --> 2:06:03.000]  Let's ask this question in closing. Let's ask this question of the Grand Boogaloo. What comes next in the Boogaloo universe? Or is there no... It's an ideology. Who creates... Who's the high priest? Who creates the ideology?
[2:06:03.000 --> 2:06:06.000]  Does it just flow forth from where?
[2:06:06.000 --> 2:06:19.000]  It's autonomous, and the next thing is unity, unifying the lower bodies, the people that are subject to this globalism that you speak of, and this elitist mentality that is running the U.S. through our governmental officials.
[2:06:19.000 --> 2:06:26.000]  It's unifying those people and getting ready to stand physically to defend our rights, our life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[2:06:26.000 --> 2:06:32.000]  Well, I mean, I think people have a right to stand up, and I think they should. Let me ask you this. Have you been contacted by the FBI?
[2:06:32.000 --> 2:06:43.000]  Yes, I have. You're not... There's a joke in the Boogaloo that you're not Boogaloo. You haven't been questioned, so the FBI has been all over us.
[2:06:43.000 --> 2:06:47.000]  So what did the FBI say? What did they come to you about?
[2:06:47.000 --> 2:06:56.000]  They like asking questions at all. That's all, and I don't like giving them answers, so if that paints a good picture for you, I hope it does.
[2:06:56.000 --> 2:07:04.000]  Well, I just think what happened at the Capitol was called screw in the pooch, and it ruined the great thing we had set up, and it gave the left a major victory.
[2:07:04.000 --> 2:07:08.000]  What do you think of the Q movement, Mr. Dunn?
[2:07:08.000 --> 2:07:20.000]  A lot is found in baseless conspiracies. I think there are one or two things that might be true, but for the most part, it's just a baseless conspiracy idea.
[2:07:20.000 --> 2:07:27.000]  Well, I get a group of armed Americans that are non-political and just want their freedom, so I get the need for that.
[2:07:27.000 --> 2:07:38.000]  I just think that you guys are kind of putting yourselves in uniform, like the last uniform you want is one that stands out, and then anybody can put on a Hawaiian shirt and go out and do terrible things.
[2:07:38.000 --> 2:07:41.000]  I think like the Cubans or anything.
[2:07:41.000 --> 2:07:51.000]  To a certain extent, Alex, I do agree with you there. The thing is, though, is that, and once again, no offense to you directly, but you're a generation, and the ones before you, they put it on my generation's heads.
[2:07:51.000 --> 2:07:59.000]  And so we have to stand up. So if you haven't solved the problem, you can't come at us for trying to solve the problem a different way. You cannot tell me because you haven't solved it.
[2:07:59.000 --> 2:08:12.000]  So, so, so, okay, I'm just saying the local, the capital is a symbol of us voting, just because it's been captured doesn't mean we attack that. The New World Order, I'm not trying to get you to go attack people.
[2:08:12.000 --> 2:08:22.000]  I'm just saying, if I saw a movement saying we're going after Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab and the Rothschilds, the New World Order and the CFR Building in New York, I'd say those guys are real and they're about to get a fight.
[2:08:22.000 --> 2:08:30.000]  Because about 10 minutes after you said that, they would be having the HRT SWAT teams will be coming after your ass. Within a day, you're going to get SWAT teams.
[2:08:30.000 --> 2:08:40.000]  Alex, what have I said repeatedly? I have said repeatedly that we stand against the vocalists and the elites that continue to control this country. So when you're saying, oh, if I saw people that were going after that, we literally stand against it.
[2:08:40.000 --> 2:08:49.000]  We stand against the pedophilia that's prevalent in Hollywood. We stand against media controlling people. We stand against the elites that run our government. We stand against the money that run our government.
[2:08:49.000 --> 2:08:52.000]  It's just that we're going in a slightly different way than what you agree with.
[2:08:52.000 --> 2:09:00.000]  All I wanted to come on here and say, Alex, if you allow me to finish real quick, all I wanted to come on here and say, man, is these people out there putting in the work, you know, you call them CIA ops.
[2:09:00.000 --> 2:09:07.000]  You said, release the boogaloo. You know, you like to make your jokes, but these people are legitimate people who are putting in the work and believing in what they stand for.
[2:09:07.000 --> 2:09:12.000]  There are people in the boogaloo movement who don't agree with me. There are people in the boogaloo movement who are different than me.
[2:09:12.000 --> 2:09:21.000]  But these people are putting in work. They're not CIA ops. They don't work for the CIA. They're not unwiddling CIA sources. And they're not controlled opposition like sometimes you appear to be.
[2:09:21.000 --> 2:09:26.000]  We are legitimate people who believe in what we stand for. That's all I'm controlled opposition.
[2:09:26.000 --> 2:09:31.000]  Or you are. I'm controlled. Who gives me my orders? Please tell me.
[2:09:31.000 --> 2:09:43.000]  I do believe you're 100% controlled opposition, Alex. That's why you'll never, you'll never preach anything besides peaceful and legal, lawful, wonderful, hunky dory ways of protest.
[2:09:43.000 --> 2:09:49.000]  Okay, so I'm not the one saying we got fireteams in the capital and then you guys haven't been indicted and then they're trying to indict me.
[2:09:49.000 --> 2:09:55.000]  And then you're sitting there literally saying I'm getting orders from a higher level group, which is not the case.
[2:09:55.000 --> 2:09:59.000]  Look at my eyes. I take orders from God. That's it. You understand that?
[2:09:59.000 --> 2:10:05.000]  You fired the one good man you had and that was David Knight. I do believe you're a controlled opposition, Alex.
[2:10:05.000 --> 2:10:12.000]  So let me just clear the record here, please, as a neutral person. David Knight does not support offensive violence.
[2:10:12.000 --> 2:10:17.000]  I mean, I like David. David did not like our support of Trump. He was upset. That's why I let him go.
[2:10:17.000 --> 2:10:20.000]  Other way around. He wasn't happy here.
[2:10:20.000 --> 2:10:24.000]  Once again, I take order to say that. Hold on, Owen. You can counter this right now.
[2:10:24.000 --> 2:10:32.000]  Let me just say this. I've worked at Info Wars for five years. I can guarantee you there's nobody controlling Alex Jones.
[2:10:32.000 --> 2:10:37.000]  I've had screaming matches with Alex Jones about stuff. Okay, so trust me, nobody controls what goes on here.
[2:10:37.000 --> 2:10:42.000]  Half the time we were like Joe Biden, we can't even put a pen in our pocket. Okay, that's how real this is.
[2:10:42.000 --> 2:10:46.000]  Now, guys, we need to stop bickering about all this crap. This is exactly what the globalists want.
[2:10:46.000 --> 2:10:52.000]  We need unity. I say, oh, you want unity under Biden. I believe Trump, we could have peace. I believe Trump, we could do this.
[2:10:52.000 --> 2:10:56.000]  He tried to stop wars. He did stop the wars. He didn't start any new wars. Trump did some good things.
[2:10:56.000 --> 2:11:00.000]  So it's not to sit here and say, oh, it's just when Biden's, I've never been a violent revolutionary.
[2:11:00.000 --> 2:11:08.000]  I've been arrested for my peaceful protest. I'm calling for, we have to awaken 50 million, 100 million, 200 million Americans
[2:11:08.000 --> 2:11:14.000]  before you could ever even think about doing a finger lick of violence in this country and have a chance at victory.
[2:11:14.000 --> 2:11:15.000]  That's all I'm saying.
[2:11:15.000 --> 2:11:19.000]  Well, it doesn't matter. We've done some good radio here and had some thought-provoking things.
[2:11:19.000 --> 2:11:23.000]  And done, I'm not going to do cheap shots like you did. I think you're a well-spoken person.
[2:11:23.000 --> 2:11:28.000]  And you have, I mean, I think you believe what you're saying. And so we'll continue to watch the situation as it unfolds.
[2:11:28.000 --> 2:11:31.000]  And I appreciate you coming up here and defending your ideas. That's all I can say.
[2:11:31.000 --> 2:11:34.000]  But yeah, it's pretty hilarious.
[2:11:34.000 --> 2:11:38.000]  Now, I built this whole thing myself. I did it with our listeners. And I'm so proud of the fact that I'm independent.
[2:11:38.000 --> 2:11:41.000]  And I don't trust people that aren't independent. And that's what we're all about.
[2:11:41.000 --> 2:11:47.000]  All right, we got Pete Santilli chiming in. And then we've got Leo Zagami on the fall of the Italian government.
[2:11:47.000 --> 2:11:48.000]  Stay with us. We'll be right back.
[2:11:48.000 --> 2:11:52.000]  I've got some bad news. Our best-selling vitamin mineral fusion has sold out.
[2:11:52.000 --> 2:11:58.000]  Because people understand, in these stressful times, it's now more important than ever to boost your body's natural defenses.
[2:11:58.000 --> 2:12:06.000]  But here's the good news. Tumoric acts in very similar ways and is so good for inflammation, so good for your immune system.
[2:12:06.000 --> 2:12:14.000]  And we've got two great tumeric formulas. One is body's ultimate tumeric formula that is a dried tumeric extract, 95% cumanoid.
[2:12:14.000 --> 2:12:19.000]  People love it. That's selling out. But despite that, it's still discounted at infowarstore.com.
[2:12:19.000 --> 2:12:26.000]  And then also selling out this week is our liquid tumeric extract. It's called liquid tumeric extract.
[2:12:26.000 --> 2:12:29.000]  People really love it. It's extremely strong as well. It's selling out.
[2:12:29.000 --> 2:12:37.000]  And your purchase doesn't just help yourself and your body. It also funds the Info War and keeps us on air while they're trying to shut everybody down.
[2:12:37.000 --> 2:12:47.000]  So thank you all for your support. Please visit infowarstore.com and find so many other great items that will enrich yourself and your family's life and fund the Info War.
[2:12:47.000 --> 2:13:10.000]  And God bless and good luck.
[2:13:17.000 --> 2:13:34.000]  All I know is with DNA Force, we went out and looked at these high-end products that they sell through doctor clinics that aren't prescription, but the doctor sells like 300 bucks a bottle.
[2:13:34.000 --> 2:13:37.000]  Because there's a lot of expensive products and it's really only costing like 50 bucks.
[2:13:37.000 --> 2:13:52.000]  And so we basically cloned two different top brands together and that's what produced this. So thanks. Thanks for the plug.
[2:13:52.000 --> 2:14:00.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:14:00.000 --> 2:14:24.000]  Before you slip into unconsciousness, I'd like to have another kiss, another flashing chance.
[2:14:24.000 --> 2:14:32.000]  Okay, so we just had Mike Dunn, the leader of the Boogaloo Boys on for a lengthy, hour-long interview.
[2:14:32.000 --> 2:14:40.000]  And he didn't deny that these are his tweets and his parlor comments, but he says when they said they were in the capital, they meant the capital of D.C.
[2:14:40.000 --> 2:14:49.000]  Well, funny. He doesn't deny these are his. Onscreen, please. Listen to this. Scroll down, guys. Parlor.
[2:14:49.000 --> 2:15:02.000]  He deleted all this later. The Last Sons of Liberty. Official statement. Boogaloo Boys associated with the Last Sons of Liberty played an important part in the breach of the capital.
[2:15:02.000 --> 2:15:10.000]  Any movement to be used to throw a middle finger to tyranny should be capitalized on.
[2:15:10.000 --> 2:15:21.000]  Yesterday, when presented with the moment, undercover boys went to work to hype up the people.
[2:15:21.000 --> 2:15:27.000]  Working alongside other Last Sons not being solely responsible for the event took place.
[2:15:27.000 --> 2:15:35.000]  A breach was made in the building, which is rightfully ours to walk in as we please because our taxes made for it.
[2:15:35.000 --> 2:15:44.000]  The video posted is pieced from several others of boys who provided overwatch along with direction.
[2:15:44.000 --> 2:15:53.000]  This video does not incriminate anyone of ours and wasn't sent to us, was sent to us by anonymous by Last Sons Boogaloo Boys.
[2:15:53.000 --> 2:16:02.000]  This is our footage, Mike Dunn. And he didn't deny that's his. So he lied in front of everyone.
[2:16:02.000 --> 2:16:09.000]  He's a disgusting little rat. And I challenged him to come back on the show tomorrow.
[2:16:09.000 --> 2:16:13.000]  Because I meant to get to this and I forgot about it while it was on.
[2:16:13.000 --> 2:16:19.000]  And so these guys all have these illusions of grandeur that all these armed people are under him and oh, they've got all this power and all this.
[2:16:19.000 --> 2:16:23.000]  They gave a home run devastating defeat to what Trump and I wanted.
[2:16:23.000 --> 2:16:32.000]  Who he mishe hates to try to have a 10 day investigation of election fraud that we all need as Americans. And then he calls it cowardly.
[2:16:32.000 --> 2:16:39.000]  Just like Pachinix on he goes, you never learn in the military. Trump will still be in January 20th. You don't know.
[2:16:39.000 --> 2:16:44.000]  Same guy like your generation failed. I'm a commando. I'm doing all this stuff. Give me a break.
[2:16:44.000 --> 2:16:53.000]  In fact, I challenge Mike Dunn to a bare knuckles boxing match in a ring. I'm 47. He's 27. He thinks he's so freaking tough all day long.
[2:16:53.000 --> 2:17:00.000]  Let's do it and get the money to charity. I am so sick of all these wannabe tough guys running their fat mouths all day about how badass they are.
[2:17:00.000 --> 2:17:09.000]  Now, does that mean I want to go to war with every person in the Boogaloo movement? No, but you're being manipulated like the Feds did to the militias in the 1990s.
[2:17:09.000 --> 2:17:19.000]  And I do not respect that type of crap right there when he said they went in that capital and they were proud of it and he deleted it now to sit there and lie to every one of us.
[2:17:19.000 --> 2:17:24.000]  It's disgusting. And I wish I'd have said it when he was on. I forgot to get to that. Holy Toledo.
[2:17:24.000 --> 2:17:32.000]  Oh, and Troy, we got Pete Santilli coming on, but they tried to set up as a journalist and put in prison with the whole Bundy Ranch and then the Oregon situation.
[2:17:32.000 --> 2:17:39.000]  We'll go to him in a moment. But holy hell, I'd forgotten all this. I mean, he's right there saying this is a great thing.
[2:17:39.000 --> 2:17:43.000]  And maybe he's right in his view, but don't lie to us and tell us it's not the case.
[2:17:43.000 --> 2:17:49.000]  Oh, but Alex, don't forget your controlled opposition. So what can I say here? No, look, I'll be honest with you, Alex.
[2:17:49.000 --> 2:17:53.000]  Well, climb in the ring with the controlled opposition. See what happens to your ass.
[2:17:53.000 --> 2:18:01.000]  I'm being facetious here. I'm being facetious. But Alex, I'll be honest. I think you're being a little too hard on Mike and I'm not disagreeing with the fact you're laying out.
[2:18:01.000 --> 2:18:10.000]  I just feel that we're discounting one fact here because we've been so gaslit by the media that you do have a million and a half Trump supporters out there.
[2:18:10.000 --> 2:18:17.000]  I'm not even talking about the Boogaloo Boys or whatever they did that day. I'm talking about a million and a half Trump people that were in D.C.
[2:18:17.000 --> 2:18:22.000]  I'm talking about probably 75 million plus minimum. I mean, maybe even 100 million people voted for Trump.
[2:18:22.000 --> 2:18:26.000]  I'm not even kidding you with how much election fraud that no, our election was stolen.
[2:18:26.000 --> 2:18:32.000]  And for them, this is like, this is like a wave of the reality hitting them.
[2:18:32.000 --> 2:18:37.000]  No, I agree. People should be pissed. I'm not surprised they stormed the Capitol and tricked our folks to do it. I get it.
[2:18:37.000 --> 2:18:42.000]  We bet pedophiles everywhere, new old order. I get his point if he's legitimate. Maybe he's real.
[2:18:42.000 --> 2:18:47.000]  OK, and he has a perspective of declaration of independence and maybe he's right.
[2:18:47.000 --> 2:18:51.000]  I'm just saying, don't claim you went to the Capitol and did all this and then later tell us you didn't.
[2:18:51.000 --> 2:18:57.000]  Yeah, I think, I mean, he's going to have to speak for himself and his actions. I don't know what there may be an investigation into him or not.
[2:18:57.000 --> 2:19:02.000]  I'm not trying to get into trouble. The worst these people deserve is a trespassing thing. They're not terrorists.
[2:19:02.000 --> 2:19:08.000]  Yeah. And so, but see, that's the question here. And I don't know if he's had to go through this intellectually if he's made statements.
[2:19:08.000 --> 2:19:13.000]  We've been there. I mean, you got to ask yourself a question and make a decision. I've had to do this multiple times.
[2:19:13.000 --> 2:19:18.000]  Are you willing to go to jail? Are you willing to go to jail for something?
[2:19:18.000 --> 2:19:23.000]  And do you think it'll have a lasting impact or better yet, are you willing to die?
[2:19:23.000 --> 2:19:26.000]  And do you think your death will have a lasting impact or will you have died in vain?
[2:19:26.000 --> 2:19:30.000]  I mean, so these are the questions that are at the top of this intellectual debate.
[2:19:30.000 --> 2:19:34.000]  And at the bottom is, hey, how can we have unity? How can I come together with the Boogaloo boys?
[2:19:34.000 --> 2:19:37.000]  How can I come together with Black Lives Matter? How can I come together with Antifa?
[2:19:37.000 --> 2:19:39.000]  Yeah, I believe Trump was going to have a chance.
[2:19:39.000 --> 2:19:43.000]  We have a giant pecker. You fight. You fight the Antifa champion. I fight Mike Dunn.
[2:19:43.000 --> 2:19:48.000]  And then we clink glasses and realize, you know what? We're all anti-establishment. Maybe we're not so bad.
[2:19:48.000 --> 2:19:51.000]  Mike accepts.
[2:19:51.000 --> 2:19:54.000]  Well, hey, you know what? I've been trying to do political boxing.
[2:19:54.000 --> 2:19:58.000]  See, but here's the problem. That's my point, though, Alex. At least he comes on air.
[2:19:58.000 --> 2:20:02.000]  Hey, I've been watching that the Jake Paul and his brother, I want to do this.
[2:20:02.000 --> 2:20:06.000]  I mean, honestly, I've got to fight like some championship badass black dude.
[2:20:06.000 --> 2:20:09.000]  I got to fight little cubby, bubby. I'm ready.
[2:20:09.000 --> 2:20:13.000]  But Alex, at least he comes on air. We played the clip of Joy Reid. You showed Jim Acosta.
[2:20:13.000 --> 2:20:17.000]  You showed Anderson Cooper. You showed Don Lemon. You showed Rachel Maddow.
[2:20:17.000 --> 2:20:21.000]  Those are the cowards. Those are the frauds. Those are the liars.
[2:20:21.000 --> 2:20:25.000]  Those are the enemies of free speech, the enemies of truth, and the enemies of America.
[2:20:25.000 --> 2:20:28.000]  I'm not calling for violence against them. I want to expose them.
[2:20:28.000 --> 2:20:32.000]  That's why they censor us on the Internet, because they know that's the path to real victory,
[2:20:32.000 --> 2:20:35.000]  is exposing them and uniting the people against them.
[2:20:35.000 --> 2:20:38.000]  I agree, but what state has legal bear locals boxing?
[2:20:38.000 --> 2:20:40.000]  I think Texas has mutual combat.
[2:20:40.000 --> 2:20:42.000]  We do? All right.
[2:20:42.000 --> 2:20:44.000]  I know the Washington state. I think Washington...
[2:20:44.000 --> 2:20:47.000]  I'll get worn out with some gloves, but as long as it's Bear and Michaels, I'm not worried.
[2:20:47.000 --> 2:20:49.000]  I don't know. There's states that still have mutual combat laws.
[2:20:49.000 --> 2:20:51.000]  Less than 15 seconds.
[2:20:51.000 --> 2:20:53.000]  But that's not... We want mutual combat.
[2:20:53.000 --> 2:20:56.000]  Actually, people don't know. It's all... People think I'm full of talk.
[2:20:56.000 --> 2:20:58.000]  I need to start getting a ring with some people. This is going to...
[2:20:58.000 --> 2:21:03.000]  I think Alex, I don't think... But maybe you have him if he wants to do it.
[2:21:03.000 --> 2:21:06.000]  But really, it should be you and Chunky Ogert or Brian Stelter.
[2:21:06.000 --> 2:21:08.000]  I mean, that's the match that people want to see.
[2:21:08.000 --> 2:21:12.000]  I agree. I will take on Sink, Juger of the Young Turds,
[2:21:12.000 --> 2:21:15.000]  and I'll take on the guy that looks like a pedophile, but isn't.
[2:21:15.000 --> 2:21:18.000]  I mean, I would just say if I was casting people as a pedophile, it would be Brian Stelter.
[2:21:18.000 --> 2:21:23.000]  I will take on Mike Dunn, Brian Stelter, and Sink, Juger all at the same time.
[2:21:23.000 --> 2:21:26.000]  But I get a baseball bat with nails in it.
[2:21:26.000 --> 2:21:30.000]  And all they get is trash can lids.
[2:21:30.000 --> 2:21:33.000]  Well, I mean, here's the thing.
[2:21:33.000 --> 2:21:36.000]  By the way, this is all a joke, folks. I'm scared of Mike Dunn.
[2:21:36.000 --> 2:21:39.000]  One look at him at a fundamental level.
[2:21:39.000 --> 2:21:41.000]  Like, deep down, I get scared.
[2:21:41.000 --> 2:21:43.000]  Well, Alex, here's my thing. I...
[2:21:43.000 --> 2:21:45.000]  I'm backing out. Mike's too powerful.
[2:21:45.000 --> 2:21:48.000]  I love debate. I love it. I love people that disagree with me.
[2:21:48.000 --> 2:21:50.000]  I believe in my intellect and my logic.
[2:21:50.000 --> 2:21:52.000]  I'm just saying they want this violent so it's a joke.
[2:21:52.000 --> 2:21:54.000]  But that's my point is that...
[2:21:54.000 --> 2:21:57.000]  Obviously, I'm backing down. That dude looks like freakin' Mike Tyson.
[2:21:57.000 --> 2:21:59.000]  The point is that we're...
[2:21:59.000 --> 2:22:02.000]  Actually, I pissed my pants earlier. Did you know I actually have urine all over me right now?
[2:22:02.000 --> 2:22:04.000]  Let's see. Stand up.
[2:22:04.000 --> 2:22:07.000]  Let's see the britches. Let's see the britches.
[2:22:07.000 --> 2:22:09.000]  I'm embarrassed right now.
[2:22:09.000 --> 2:22:12.000]  All right. All right.
[2:22:12.000 --> 2:22:17.000]  You urinated. You're defecated all over yourself.
[2:22:17.000 --> 2:22:19.000]  You know, I feel sorry for Mike.
[2:22:19.000 --> 2:22:23.000]  And I'm like, that is under his nose, which would not be very nice.
[2:22:23.000 --> 2:22:26.000]  No, but I'm telling you, Mike, hey, look, Mike...
[2:22:26.000 --> 2:22:28.000]  I've not happened twice. The nose bone sticks in the hand.
[2:22:28.000 --> 2:22:30.000]  I don't believe that Mike is the enemy.
[2:22:30.000 --> 2:22:32.000]  I don't believe the Boogaloo Boys are the enemy.
[2:22:32.000 --> 2:22:34.000]  I actually love Mike. Actually, here's the thing.
[2:22:34.000 --> 2:22:36.000]  Me and Mike have been dating for a long time.
[2:22:36.000 --> 2:22:38.000]  And he left me a while back.
[2:22:38.000 --> 2:22:40.000]  We're Southern Parvy Law Center workers.
[2:22:40.000 --> 2:22:43.000]  And Morris D. is our daddy. He's our leather daddy.
[2:22:43.000 --> 2:22:45.000]  And he wears a leather outfit.
[2:22:45.000 --> 2:22:47.000]  Well, then he has a little bullwhip. He pops.
[2:22:47.000 --> 2:22:52.000]  We here at Info Wars are proud to announce the first ever Kava Kava root supplement
[2:22:52.000 --> 2:22:55.000]  that is now available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[2:22:55.000 --> 2:22:59.000]  Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural health world today.
[2:22:59.000 --> 2:23:02.000]  Though it has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific Islands
[2:23:02.000 --> 2:23:05.000]  for its relaxation and euphoric effects.
[2:23:05.000 --> 2:23:11.000]  According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa,
[2:23:11.000 --> 2:23:15.000]  who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[2:23:15.000 --> 2:23:19.000]  The Samoan people would drink Kava tea during social gatherings
[2:23:19.000 --> 2:23:21.000]  and sacred ceremonies to loosen up a little.
[2:23:21.000 --> 2:23:26.000]  Nowadays, Kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[2:23:26.000 --> 2:23:30.000]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend
[2:23:30.000 --> 2:23:35.000]  of not only Kava Kava, but other herbs including but not limited to
[2:23:35.000 --> 2:23:39.000]  German Comma Mill, Organic Skull Cap, and Balarian root.
[2:23:39.000 --> 2:23:42.000]  We do expect to sell this new product quickly,
[2:23:42.000 --> 2:23:47.000]  so be sure to secure yours by visiting InfoWarsStore.com.
[2:23:49.000 --> 2:23:51.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've studied history.
[2:23:51.000 --> 2:23:53.000]  I've interviewed all the experts.
[2:23:53.000 --> 2:23:56.000]  I have looked at every facet of this, and now,
[2:23:56.000 --> 2:24:00.000]  the only days until the inauguration of the Chai Khan agent,
[2:24:00.000 --> 2:24:01.000]  it's all coming into place.
[2:24:01.000 --> 2:24:03.000]  That's how they change the subject from election fraud.
[2:24:03.000 --> 2:24:06.000]  It's how they change the subject from Hunter's laptop.
[2:24:06.000 --> 2:24:11.000]  It's how they change the subject from Epstein and Obama and Al Qaeda
[2:24:11.000 --> 2:24:16.000]  and the New World Order, and now use the already martial law in place for COVID-19,
[2:24:16.000 --> 2:24:22.000]  and that's what it is, to then be expanded and become political and become permanent.
[2:24:22.000 --> 2:24:24.000]  They train you to stay in your houses, they train you to be tracked,
[2:24:24.000 --> 2:24:27.000]  they train you to do what you're told for nine, ten months as training wheels,
[2:24:27.000 --> 2:24:29.000]  and now they launch the storm.
[2:24:29.000 --> 2:24:31.000]  The storm is here.
[2:24:31.000 --> 2:24:33.000]  It's a globalist storm.
[2:24:33.000 --> 2:24:35.000]  There's not going to be martial law for Trump.
[2:24:35.000 --> 2:24:37.000]  There's to be martial law for the globalist.
[2:24:37.000 --> 2:24:40.000]  They're trying to set you up, don't be involved in violence,
[2:24:40.000 --> 2:24:44.000]  expose the New World Order, and expose the takeover with information.
[2:24:44.000 --> 2:24:47.000]  That's how we beat these people, with truth.
[2:24:47.000 --> 2:24:50.000]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[2:24:50.000 --> 2:24:55.000]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[2:24:55.000 --> 2:24:59.000]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition,
[2:24:59.000 --> 2:25:04.000]  buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from InfowarsStore.com.
[2:25:04.000 --> 2:25:08.000]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation
[2:25:08.000 --> 2:25:12.000]  can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels,
[2:25:12.000 --> 2:25:14.000]  decrease the growth rate of plaque,
[2:25:14.000 --> 2:25:20.000]  and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[2:25:20.000 --> 2:25:25.000]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil
[2:25:25.000 --> 2:25:32.000]  can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[2:25:32.000 --> 2:25:37.000]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion
[2:25:37.000 --> 2:25:40.000]  about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[2:25:40.000 --> 2:25:47.000]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at InfowarsStore.com.
[2:26:11.000 --> 2:26:14.000]  Alright, we are back live, broadcasting worldwide.
[2:26:14.000 --> 2:26:17.000]  And I want to be clear, that's what we got Pete Santilli coming on right now.
[2:26:17.000 --> 2:26:23.000]  I'm not believing Reuters that Enrique Tario is a federal informant for drug stuff in Miami.
[2:26:23.000 --> 2:26:28.000]  But you know, he did get set up or selling resale medical equipment.
[2:26:28.000 --> 2:26:30.000]  I looked it up, that was all BS.
[2:26:30.000 --> 2:26:31.000]  I think Enrique's a good guy.
[2:26:31.000 --> 2:26:34.000]  I've had dinner with him three or four times, hung out with him in Austin.
[2:26:34.000 --> 2:26:36.000]  And you know, I like Joe Biggs.
[2:26:36.000 --> 2:26:38.000]  He's been arrested by the FBI in this whole deal.
[2:26:38.000 --> 2:26:40.000]  You know, Joe's good, he wasn't violent.
[2:26:40.000 --> 2:26:45.000]  So I want to be clear, when I say that they had people infiltrating the Proud Boys,
[2:26:45.000 --> 2:26:46.000]  that's because it's a fact.
[2:26:46.000 --> 2:26:49.000]  And we know some people posing as Proud Boys did go into the Capitol.
[2:26:49.000 --> 2:26:51.000]  And I just want people going forward to be aware of this.
[2:26:51.000 --> 2:26:55.000]  As for the Boogaloo's, I know that's a very, very diverse group of people.
[2:26:55.000 --> 2:27:00.000]  And I think Mike Dunn, you know, overall tried to really square up and do a major debate with me.
[2:27:00.000 --> 2:27:02.000]  And he was fair to come on the show.
[2:27:02.000 --> 2:27:06.000]  But the larger issues of what he did, saying I'm a fed and all this other stuff,
[2:27:06.000 --> 2:27:08.000]  there's no proof of that, it's not true.
[2:27:08.000 --> 2:27:14.000]  All I'm saying is, we don't need to invade capitals and give the left the pretext
[2:27:14.000 --> 2:27:16.000]  to have a major clamp down on this country.
[2:27:16.000 --> 2:27:17.000]  And that's my common sense.
[2:27:17.000 --> 2:27:18.000]  That's not me afraid of conflict.
[2:27:18.000 --> 2:27:21.000]  You know, that's why I sit there and I confront all these different groups
[2:27:21.000 --> 2:27:23.000]  of organizations on the left and the right.
[2:27:23.000 --> 2:27:24.000]  That's what it's all about.
[2:27:24.000 --> 2:27:30.000]  Now we've got a man that became a political prisoner on the line.
[2:27:30.000 --> 2:27:32.000]  Pete Santilli.
[2:27:32.000 --> 2:27:36.000]  You know, I used to think he was a fed because he was so out there and, you know,
[2:27:36.000 --> 2:27:38.000]  this and that, putting out kind of that rhetoric.
[2:27:38.000 --> 2:27:42.000]  Later he found out he was being set up and he covered what happened with the Bundy Ranch
[2:27:42.000 --> 2:27:44.000]  and then out in Oregon and so much more.
[2:27:44.000 --> 2:27:48.000]  And he literally didn't plead bargain and beat their fake case against him.
[2:27:48.000 --> 2:27:52.000]  And he called us and we respect him and said, hey, you know, be careful.
[2:27:52.000 --> 2:27:55.000]  And all news reading Reuters, I didn't say I believed it.
[2:27:55.000 --> 2:27:59.000]  This is probably a Psyop to say that Enrique Tarrio is a proboy.
[2:27:59.000 --> 2:28:02.000]  I want to make the whole show about what happened on the 6th.
[2:28:02.000 --> 2:28:06.000]  We've got global microchips, forced inoculations, the vaccine killing people,
[2:28:06.000 --> 2:28:08.000]  the trial of Trump coming up.
[2:28:08.000 --> 2:28:12.000]  We've got so many big things going on and unfolding here.
[2:28:12.000 --> 2:28:15.000]  I'm just simply saying the left says we're a bunch of violent terrorists
[2:28:15.000 --> 2:28:17.000]  that are going to start killing each other.
[2:28:17.000 --> 2:28:20.000]  Let's not play with their hands because if I was them and I was a Machiavellian,
[2:28:20.000 --> 2:28:23.000]  I would be staging truck bombs and things to blame us.
[2:28:23.000 --> 2:28:27.000]  So I see their next move as a false flag, as I said before the 6th.
[2:28:27.000 --> 2:28:30.000]  So that's why I'm so concerned and trying to get people to get out of this
[2:28:30.000 --> 2:28:33.000]  violent revolution talk because this is an information war.
[2:28:33.000 --> 2:28:35.000]  Sure, call me old, call me a wimp.
[2:28:35.000 --> 2:28:37.000]  Say I'm sitting it out.
[2:28:37.000 --> 2:28:40.000]  You know, Mike Dunn's probably not a fed.
[2:28:40.000 --> 2:28:43.000]  He had talking points to try to say I was a fed,
[2:28:43.000 --> 2:28:45.000]  but I don't think he's a fed.
[2:28:45.000 --> 2:28:47.000]  Okay, I just think he's misguided and pissed off
[2:28:47.000 --> 2:28:50.000]  and feels like he has a revolutionary duty and caught up with the moment.
[2:28:50.000 --> 2:28:53.000]  Same thing, proud boys on average are great, amazing people
[2:28:53.000 --> 2:28:56.000]  just because maybe their leader was an informant.
[2:28:56.000 --> 2:28:58.000]  Well, the feds come after your ass.
[2:28:58.000 --> 2:29:00.000]  So let's go ahead and go to Pete Santilli.
[2:29:00.000 --> 2:29:02.000]  And of course, Owen Schroeder's ride to shotgun here.
[2:29:02.000 --> 2:29:06.000]  He can pop in any time, but go ahead.
[2:29:06.000 --> 2:29:08.000]  Alex, thanks for having me back on.
[2:29:08.000 --> 2:29:12.000]  You know, one thing that I learned through the two federal trials that,
[2:29:12.000 --> 2:29:17.000]  by the way, I was directly involved in defeating them for the following reasons.
[2:29:17.000 --> 2:29:20.000]  When we talk about the FBI, I mean, if there's anything we get out of this
[2:29:20.000 --> 2:29:23.000]  particular segment before I leave, I want everybody to know,
[2:29:23.000 --> 2:29:29.000]  and I think you'll agree with me that one thing we need is reform within the FBI.
[2:29:29.000 --> 2:29:36.000]  What this FBI informant thing yesterday was the fifth anniversary, January 26th,
[2:29:36.000 --> 2:29:42.000]  is the day that an FBI informant actually set up an ambush with a convoy.
[2:29:42.000 --> 2:29:47.000]  He was the top, he was the lead security guy and led to the,
[2:29:47.000 --> 2:29:49.000]  and yes, people do die, by the way.
[2:29:49.000 --> 2:29:51.000]  I have one of their names.
[2:29:51.000 --> 2:29:53.000]  His name is LaVoy Fenicum.
[2:29:53.000 --> 2:29:58.000]  He was led into that ambush by an FBI informant, a confidential human source.
[2:29:58.000 --> 2:30:03.000]  What I've learned through the Bundy Ranch trials in the Malier National Wildlife Refuge
[2:30:03.000 --> 2:30:09.000]  is that Mr. Boogaloo Boy mentioned something when I was doing research on Enrique Terrio.
[2:30:09.000 --> 2:30:14.000]  The number one indication that you've got somebody that is either an FBI informant
[2:30:14.000 --> 2:30:20.000]  or potentially to be compromised, to become an FBI informant or somebody that cooperates
[2:30:20.000 --> 2:30:23.000]  is when they start talking about unlawful activity.
[2:30:23.000 --> 2:30:27.000]  At no point in time did the President incite anyone to break the law.
[2:30:27.000 --> 2:30:31.000]  At no point in time did I ever hear Alex Jones say, let's go to D.C. and let's go break the law.
[2:30:31.000 --> 2:30:33.000]  You didn't even ask for civil disobedience.
[2:30:33.000 --> 2:30:35.000]  You just asked for sheer numbers.
[2:30:35.000 --> 2:30:43.000]  When that Mr. Graham Boogaloo Boy with the USMC hat on says that he breaks the law
[2:30:43.000 --> 2:30:48.000]  by open caring in places where he shouldn't, we patriots don't break the law.
[2:30:48.000 --> 2:30:52.000]  We're defensive. I mean, even the citizen's militia that's lawful, compliant,
[2:30:52.000 --> 2:30:57.000]  they work with their sheriff, their legislators, they're not talking about breaking the law.
[2:30:57.000 --> 2:31:00.000]  Now, when this gentleman comes on and talks about breaking the law,
[2:31:00.000 --> 2:31:06.000]  or he's online doing exactly what the FBI wants, it's basically a freebie for them to grab him.
[2:31:06.000 --> 2:31:10.000]  He should get an attorney, by the way, based on what I heard in his last presentation,
[2:31:10.000 --> 2:31:12.000]  because they're going to roll this guy.
[2:31:12.000 --> 2:31:16.000]  If he's the leader of the Boogaloo Boys, he's the perfect candidate to say,
[2:31:16.000 --> 2:31:20.000]  look, you're facing 30 years for seditious conspiracy.
[2:31:20.000 --> 2:31:25.000]  But if you cooperate, quote unquote, we will give you time served.
[2:31:25.000 --> 2:31:29.000]  We just need your testimony and you come into court and we'll let you go.
[2:31:29.000 --> 2:31:31.000]  And basically they get 10 other people.
[2:31:31.000 --> 2:31:34.000]  This happened in two separate trials.
[2:31:34.000 --> 2:31:38.000]  We even had a confidential human source and FBI informant.
[2:31:38.000 --> 2:31:40.000]  His name was Jared Miller.
[2:31:40.000 --> 2:31:41.000]  He worked with the LVMPD.
[2:31:41.000 --> 2:31:45.000]  He was running around at Bundy Ranch asking, he said, I've got a felony.
[2:31:45.000 --> 2:31:47.000]  And I'm looking for an AK-47.
[2:31:47.000 --> 2:31:49.000]  I said, what the heck is that?
[2:31:49.000 --> 2:31:50.000]  Get the heck away from us.
[2:31:50.000 --> 2:31:52.000]  Go hand out water.
[2:31:52.000 --> 2:31:54.000]  You can't be near a gun that's breaking the law.
[2:31:54.000 --> 2:31:56.000]  And Pete, let's be clear.
[2:31:56.000 --> 2:31:59.000]  You were a guy not calling for violence and recovering at the time.
[2:31:59.000 --> 2:32:00.000]  Never.
[2:32:00.000 --> 2:32:03.000]  And you still were in jail for years and they tried to set you up.
[2:32:03.000 --> 2:32:04.000]  You didn't police.
[2:32:04.000 --> 2:32:05.000]  You got out.
[2:32:05.000 --> 2:32:06.000]  I mean, this is dangerous.
[2:32:06.000 --> 2:32:08.000]  I'm trying to tell people playing soldier is dangerous.
[2:32:08.000 --> 2:32:10.000]  So I shouldn't kid with people.
[2:32:10.000 --> 2:32:11.000]  I shouldn't get on the level.
[2:32:11.000 --> 2:32:14.000]  He's calling me a fed and call him a young punk and stuff.
[2:32:14.000 --> 2:32:15.000]  I apologize for that.
[2:32:15.000 --> 2:32:18.000]  I'm not against all the Boogaloo people and I'm sure as hell not, not, not.
[2:32:18.000 --> 2:32:19.000]  Some people are texting me.
[2:32:19.000 --> 2:32:21.000]  Hey, are you saying the Proud Boys are feds?
[2:32:21.000 --> 2:32:23.000]  No, it's in Reuters saying that.
[2:32:23.000 --> 2:32:25.000]  And that's why you originally wanted to come on.
[2:32:25.000 --> 2:32:27.000]  We'll do the next segment, but get into this now.
[2:32:27.000 --> 2:32:31.000]  You've seen this before where they come and tell Pro and say somebody's a fed when they're not.
[2:32:31.000 --> 2:32:32.000]  Explain that.
[2:32:32.000 --> 2:32:33.000]  That's right.
[2:32:33.000 --> 2:32:34.000]  I'll use an example.
[2:32:34.000 --> 2:32:36.000]  There was a man at Bundy Ranch.
[2:32:36.000 --> 2:32:38.000]  He was in charge of security for Clive and Bundy.
[2:32:38.000 --> 2:32:41.000]  He said it was a former gunnery sergeant in the Marine Corps.
[2:32:41.000 --> 2:32:45.000]  He was running around with guns and teams and he was, you know, talking the talk.
[2:32:45.000 --> 2:32:48.000]  He was on YouTube, obviously doing a lot of research.
[2:32:48.000 --> 2:32:51.000]  That guy had never spent one moment in the Marine Corps.
[2:32:51.000 --> 2:32:53.000]  He was a felon running around with firearms.
[2:32:53.000 --> 2:32:56.000]  Well, when they rounded everybody up, guess who you think?
[2:32:56.000 --> 2:33:01.000]  Who do you think was the first FBI informant that rolled and the person that cooperated?
[2:33:01.000 --> 2:33:06.000]  The man that was facing 30 years in prison plus just for being a felon with a firearm.
[2:33:06.000 --> 2:33:13.000]  So when you speak out, even if this kid that was on before the Boogaloo Boy, and I'm not disparaging the Boogaloo Boys,
[2:33:13.000 --> 2:33:23.000]  I'm informing the Boogaloo Boys, the number one indicator that you've got a compromising situation is when somebody suggests breaking the law because we're not lawbreakers.
[2:33:23.000 --> 2:33:25.000]  At Bundy Ranch, we have...
[2:33:25.000 --> 2:33:28.000]  Plus anybody breaking the law, they never say we're breaking the law.
[2:33:28.000 --> 2:33:30.000]  They say, hey, we're doing this.
[2:33:30.000 --> 2:33:34.000]  I mean, it doesn't matter where you're at, the military or the mafia or any corporate job.
[2:33:34.000 --> 2:33:38.000]  When people are breaking the law, you don't go, hey, let's break the law.
[2:33:38.000 --> 2:33:46.000]  Now, and Alex, here's a list of all the confidential human sources, all of the FBI informants.
[2:33:46.000 --> 2:33:48.000]  And we joke about it at Malier.
[2:33:48.000 --> 2:33:51.000]  We say that eight people took over the Malier National Wildlife Refuge.
[2:33:51.000 --> 2:33:53.000]  15 of them were FBI informants.
[2:33:53.000 --> 2:33:58.000]  They actually acquitted everybody because the people that broke the law were the FBI informants.
[2:33:58.000 --> 2:34:00.000]  A Portland jury acquitted the jury.
[2:34:00.000 --> 2:34:05.000]  The FBI informant program needs reform because this is what they do.
[2:34:05.000 --> 2:34:07.000]  They get people that are on drugs.
[2:34:07.000 --> 2:34:09.000]  They give them envelopes of cash.
[2:34:09.000 --> 2:34:15.000]  And this literally happened even with one of our own estranged family members that was on heroin.
[2:34:15.000 --> 2:34:19.000]  They pulled them in, gave them $4,000 in an envelope.
[2:34:19.000 --> 2:34:23.000]  She was hooked on heroin and they had her wired up.
[2:34:23.000 --> 2:34:27.000]  Fortunately, nothing was said on that wire because we're not lawbreakers.
[2:34:27.000 --> 2:34:30.000]  But what they will do is they will also take somebody.
[2:34:30.000 --> 2:34:31.000]  I'm going to have to say this.
[2:34:31.000 --> 2:34:35.000]  I like Enrique Tarrio and I'm not saying that he's a bad guy.
[2:34:35.000 --> 2:34:41.000]  But they arrested him and he faces possible criminal sentencing.
[2:34:41.000 --> 2:34:46.000]  They're going to use somebody like that to say, all right, listen, you're the leader of the proud boys.
[2:34:46.000 --> 2:34:51.000]  If you roll on a couple of guys like Joe Biggs will give you a lesser sentence.
[2:34:51.000 --> 2:34:52.000]  We need your testimony.
[2:34:52.000 --> 2:34:59.000]  And they will go out and pursue five to 10 people and take them down with Enrique Tarrio's testimony.
[2:34:59.000 --> 2:35:02.000]  My main concern is he's already done it before.
[2:35:02.000 --> 2:35:03.000]  I've already checked the record.
[2:35:03.000 --> 2:35:07.000]  He had already been a cooperator in 2012.
[2:35:07.000 --> 2:35:08.000]  And Enrique Tarrio was.
[2:35:08.000 --> 2:35:14.000]  So what's the only point is anybody involved, whether it's proud boys or Boogaloo,
[2:35:14.000 --> 2:35:18.000]  any paramilitary deal is going to have feds like flies on pals.
[2:35:18.000 --> 2:35:19.000]  You know what?
[2:35:19.000 --> 2:35:22.000]  And so the feds are always leading it going.
[2:35:22.000 --> 2:35:25.000]  Oh, no, anyone that says, look out for feds, they're the enemy.
[2:35:25.000 --> 2:35:26.000]  They're CIA.
[2:35:26.000 --> 2:35:27.000]  Don't listen to Jones.
[2:35:27.000 --> 2:35:29.000]  He's warning you to not get set up.
[2:35:29.000 --> 2:35:30.000]  He's CIA.
[2:35:30.000 --> 2:35:31.000]  No, that was CIA.
[2:35:31.000 --> 2:35:33.000]  I'd be like, yeah, Trump's going to win.
[2:35:33.000 --> 2:35:34.000]  Get in there and get him.
[2:35:34.000 --> 2:35:35.000]  All right.
[2:35:35.000 --> 2:35:36.000]  I want to come back again.
[2:35:36.000 --> 2:35:37.000]  I want Troyers take on this.
[2:35:37.000 --> 2:35:40.000]  The most a few segments of Leo Zagami coming up on the fall of the Italian government.
[2:35:40.000 --> 2:35:43.000]  I didn't mean to get off into all this today, but it's very important.
[2:35:43.000 --> 2:35:44.000]  So folks, don't get set up.
[2:35:44.000 --> 2:35:51.000]  infoawards.com has the technocrats are controlling the food supply, secure your own safe source
[2:35:51.000 --> 2:35:52.000]  of food supply sale.
[2:35:52.000 --> 2:35:56.000]  It's the new prices in 2021, but it's the lowest price for high quality food you're going to
[2:35:56.000 --> 2:35:58.000]  find at infoawards.com.
[2:35:58.000 --> 2:36:00.000]  The subsection is prepared with Alex.com.
[2:36:00.000 --> 2:36:02.000]  And it's all these globalists do this.
[2:36:02.000 --> 2:36:07.000]  And as they hoard the food and as they prepare, you need to understand that you need 25 year
[2:36:07.000 --> 2:36:11.000]  food supply in the last 25 years, one month, three months, six months, one year supplies.
[2:36:11.000 --> 2:36:14.000]  And it's the highest quality you're going to find.
[2:36:14.000 --> 2:36:16.000]  And it's just good to have that check box taken care of.
[2:36:16.000 --> 2:36:18.000]  And you know you're getting good food at a very good price.
[2:36:18.000 --> 2:36:22.000]  And you know that small percentage of it because there's not much profit in this goes to us
[2:36:22.000 --> 2:36:24.000]  to fund our operation.
[2:36:24.000 --> 2:36:27.000]  So prepare with Alex.com or infoawards.com.
[2:36:27.000 --> 2:36:30.000]  You can find the preparedness section there, water filtration, air filtration.
[2:36:30.000 --> 2:36:31.000]  It's all there.
[2:36:31.000 --> 2:36:34.000]  The technocrats are getting ready to bring in all the force GMO and more.
[2:36:34.000 --> 2:36:36.000]  It's time to start getting prepared.
[2:36:36.000 --> 2:36:37.000]  It starts with self defense.
[2:36:37.000 --> 2:36:38.000]  It starts with being prepared.
[2:36:38.000 --> 2:36:39.000]  It starts with horrible food.
[2:36:39.000 --> 2:36:40.000]  It starts with digging in.
[2:36:40.000 --> 2:36:42.000]  It starts with digging in with a long globalist fight.
[2:36:42.000 --> 2:37:11.000]  You'll win in the end.
[2:37:12.000 --> 2:37:14.000]  But it's it's a lot better than a lot of stuff.
[2:37:14.000 --> 2:37:16.000]  You know what?
[2:37:16.000 --> 2:37:18.000]  COVID more dumb is thinking they could ever imagine.
[2:37:18.000 --> 2:37:21.000]  They told us that 2.5 million people would be dead just eight months ago.
[2:37:21.000 --> 2:37:23.000]  Within three months.
[2:37:23.000 --> 2:37:24.000]  Okay.
[2:37:24.000 --> 2:37:25.000]  It's a quarter million.
[2:37:25.000 --> 2:37:29.000]  If you count all of the people that died of other things.
[2:37:29.000 --> 2:37:31.000]  We're talking 96% at co-marbidity.
[2:37:31.000 --> 2:37:32.000]  These are real numbers.
[2:37:32.000 --> 2:37:33.000]  These are real facts.
[2:37:33.000 --> 2:37:35.000]  This is the chicken little event.
[2:37:35.000 --> 2:37:38.000]  We all run our houses never come out and are taught we're not essential.
[2:37:38.000 --> 2:37:40.000]  Well, the big box stores in Amazon take over the planet.
[2:37:40.000 --> 2:37:44.960]  up against it. This is slavery. It is not something you could put up with and survive.
[2:37:46.960 --> 2:37:51.920]  Three, two, one. Here we go. It's back in stock. It's been sold out for over eight months. We
[2:37:51.920 --> 2:37:56.160]  couldn't get it because the lockdown pollen block is back in stock. Let me tell you a book about it.
[2:37:56.160 --> 2:37:59.680]  But the power of quail egg concentrate, pollen block acts differently. The traditional
[2:37:59.680 --> 2:38:03.520]  antihistamines that was clinically studied alleviate seasonal distress symptoms by helping
[2:38:03.520 --> 2:38:08.880]  to clear signage passages and aiding respiratory function. It's amazing. Folks absolutely love it.
[2:38:08.880 --> 2:38:13.360]  And again, France has been shut down, so we couldn't get it. Now a limited supply is back in
[2:38:13.360 --> 2:38:20.480]  stock, 25% off at infoworkstore.com. Pollen block, again, is available in this one minute ad. I
[2:38:20.480 --> 2:38:24.480]  don't have time to tell you all about it. But believe me, I have really wanted it back in because
[2:38:24.480 --> 2:38:29.760]  it works naturally unlike some of the stuff that's over the counter that makes you all be speedy and
[2:38:29.760 --> 2:38:34.480]  irritable and gives you a headache. This is naturally occurring. It's the secret of how the quail
[2:38:34.480 --> 2:38:40.400]  don't have the seasonal distress. And it's passed on somehow through their eggs to us. You chew up
[2:38:40.400 --> 2:38:46.400]  the pills. They taste great. It's available again infoworkstore.com pollen block infoworkstore.com

[2:40:13.840 --> 2:40:26.960]  and the chauffeur drives your car. You let everybody know but don't play with me because
[2:40:26.960 --> 2:40:32.800]  you're playing with fire. You know, I think Ellen's been right since the first hour trying to guide me
[2:40:32.800 --> 2:40:36.560]  back to not fight with the Boogaloo's and not fight with the Proud Boys, which I'm not fighting
[2:40:36.560 --> 2:40:40.240]  with any of those groups. I love the Proud Boys. I agree with a lot of stuff the Boogaloo's say.
[2:40:40.240 --> 2:40:46.640]  I just see a fertile ground for the feds to set us up. And you know what? Fine. Everybody wants
[2:40:46.640 --> 2:40:50.400]  a revolution. Do whatever you're going to do. It was all a joke about Mike Dunn in the boxing
[2:40:50.400 --> 2:40:57.920]  match. I saw that stuff with what's his name. I've been on the show. What's it called? Logan Paul.
[2:40:58.640 --> 2:41:02.320]  Logan Paul and the other Paul guy. Logan Paul in the show. I forget the other guy's name. That's
[2:41:02.320 --> 2:41:05.600]  like the biggest news in the country because they do the little boxing matches. It was a joke.
[2:41:05.600 --> 2:41:11.680]  Okay. All I know is I'm not working for the CIA. And I don't think the Dunn guy's working for the
[2:41:11.680 --> 2:41:16.320]  FBI. I kind of thought that before until actually got the guy on, which even freaks me out more.
[2:41:17.360 --> 2:41:22.560]  And we've got the forced inoculations, the world government, the Davos group, Biden saying you
[2:41:22.560 --> 2:41:27.120]  can't say China virus, signing executive orders. You got to wear two or three masks. We should
[2:41:27.120 --> 2:41:31.120]  have covered all that today. It's still been a good radio show, but ratings is not what I'm looking
[2:41:31.120 --> 2:41:37.200]  for. That Mike Dunn interview was huge. It's going to go viral. And I appreciate him coming on.
[2:41:38.720 --> 2:41:41.440]  And, you know, I get his point, you know, declaration of independence. Okay, do whatever
[2:41:41.440 --> 2:41:47.840]  you want. Fine. I mean, I get it. I'm just saying I was there trying to, here's why I'm mad at everybody,
[2:41:48.400 --> 2:41:52.000]  okay, who broke into the Capitol, even though they were between the velvet robes and all of it.
[2:41:52.800 --> 2:41:57.440]  I worked with Trump. We wanted a peaceful rally to show that we have millions and they have nobody
[2:41:57.440 --> 2:42:01.760]  and that Biden can't fill a parking lot. And we thought that's what people would do. And a small
[2:42:01.760 --> 2:42:07.360]  minority took it over. But okay, I've taken protest over. So I get it. So I'm just pissed because
[2:42:07.360 --> 2:42:14.080]  my mission and my operation got screwed. And I see it as a defeat. Other people see it as a victory.
[2:42:14.080 --> 2:42:17.600]  I don't see it as a victory. I want to go back to, I want to ensure some comments that we'll get
[2:42:17.600 --> 2:42:24.000]  peace and tell us take. Well, I think in general, Alex, there were just, there were unmeasurables
[2:42:24.000 --> 2:42:28.560]  and things that happened that were just out of our control that we didn't expect. I mean, Trump had,
[2:42:28.560 --> 2:42:32.880]  I mean, I've never seen a crowd that big for a speech at the Washington Monument. And then
[2:42:32.880 --> 2:42:38.320]  that was a bigger, bigger crowd than he had as inauguration four years ago. And so, you know,
[2:42:38.320 --> 2:42:43.040]  it's like, wow, look at all these millions of people here. And we didn't even know at the time,
[2:42:43.040 --> 2:42:45.840]  because like you said, I mean, we were having a debate right there. I mean, that's the thing
[2:42:45.840 --> 2:42:49.440]  at look, trust me, folks, there's no controlled opposition here. We're flying from the seat of
[2:42:49.440 --> 2:42:53.360]  our pants. We had a debate Alex, but you and me, the crew, we debated right there on the streets.
[2:42:53.360 --> 2:42:57.040]  When should we march? How should we march? What should our message be? Oh, okay. Peaceful march.
[2:42:57.040 --> 2:43:00.720]  All right. We're having debates during the break about, hey, Boogaloo's are probably good. Leave
[2:43:00.720 --> 2:43:04.480]  him alone. Or, you know, don't be mean to the pro boys. I'm not even being mean to pro boys.
[2:43:04.480 --> 2:43:07.280]  It's in the news. They're saying it's a federal informant. I don't know that's true.
[2:43:07.280 --> 2:43:11.920]  And so my point is that we didn't realize there were going to be 100,000 people at the Capitol
[2:43:11.920 --> 2:43:15.520]  before we were even leaving the Trump speech. We didn't realize people were going to be
[2:43:16.240 --> 2:43:20.880]  charged up and wanting to breach the Capitol while we were sitting there listening to Trump speak.
[2:43:20.880 --> 2:43:24.400]  Had we that foresight, which maybe that's our regret that we didn't,
[2:43:24.400 --> 2:43:28.160]  had we that foresight, we would have been more clear. Hey, make sure no one breaches the ground.
[2:43:28.160 --> 2:43:32.880]  Make sure they have their hearing. Make sure Trump gets there so we can have a peaceful rally.
[2:43:32.880 --> 2:43:36.000]  Well, exactly. But let me just say this before we go back to Pete Santelli,
[2:43:36.000 --> 2:43:38.960]  who's been a political president and been proven to be a political president,
[2:43:38.960 --> 2:43:42.880]  quite the four leaf clover to actually make it out of it. Almost no one else does.
[2:43:43.600 --> 2:43:50.560]  Let's expand on this. If people went into Microsoft, that is a eugenics globalist organization,
[2:43:50.560 --> 2:43:54.080]  pushing world government, pushing force inoculations that are killing people,
[2:43:55.120 --> 2:43:59.040]  I would say, okay, it's a revolution. And I'm not saying do that. But if people
[2:43:59.040 --> 2:44:03.440]  raided the CFR in New York, if people raided the Davos group, if people, I would say,
[2:44:03.440 --> 2:44:07.280]  well, they're attacking the real enemy, but the people's house and the Congress,
[2:44:07.920 --> 2:44:12.160]  when we're about to win, I'm just saying that's not the right target. That's all I'm saying is it
[2:44:12.160 --> 2:44:17.200]  was an idiotic target. And and that's why I get pissed off. Well, that's what happens when you
[2:44:17.200 --> 2:44:20.720]  don't have, and again, I've never been a violent revolutionary, never will be. But that's what
[2:44:20.720 --> 2:44:24.240]  happens when you think you're going to have a violent revolution, or you think you're going to
[2:44:24.240 --> 2:44:27.840]  spark a violent revolution, or maybe you have that in the back of your mind and you don't actually
[2:44:27.840 --> 2:44:33.280]  be here. Let's be sure the Q thing created this. The main group that went in behind the
[2:44:33.280 --> 2:44:38.240]  Antifa was Q people, not against the average Q person, but they believe this was all Q. We're
[2:44:38.240 --> 2:44:43.920]  winning. We're this was the real if you want to make the comparisons to 7 10 17 76, which I'm
[2:44:43.920 --> 2:44:48.000]  in agreement with you, that's about the ideology, not about the physical violence. They didn't
[2:44:48.000 --> 2:44:52.160]  just show up. I mean, they planned the Boston Tea Party, they planned hiding in the woods when
[2:44:52.160 --> 2:44:58.080]  the Redcoats marched through specifically attack the ships that were paying the tax and made them
[2:44:58.080 --> 2:45:04.160]  pay. That was a very precise attack. And I'll just say this as far as Enrique is concerned. You
[2:45:04.160 --> 2:45:10.800]  know, I consider Enrique a pretty close friend. I know some things about his past and I would be
[2:45:10.800 --> 2:45:16.960]  shocked. I would be shocked and stunned if Enrique would capitulate to the FBI or become
[2:45:16.960 --> 2:45:21.040]  some sort of informer against his boys. I don't want to say too much private stuff. I mean,
[2:45:21.040 --> 2:45:25.360]  maybe he'll go on record, but I'll tell you what they're saying is years ago, he was an informant
[2:45:26.160 --> 2:45:31.360]  when he was selling like medical supplies for testing for diabetes. And I know that works.
[2:45:31.360 --> 2:45:35.360]  If you don't, you're not an official company or not a resale. I looked up his stuff. He went to
[2:45:35.360 --> 2:45:40.000]  jail for that. So like that's nothing. And so it's like, oh, past stuff like five, 10 years ago,
[2:45:40.000 --> 2:45:43.600]  and we've got who knows if it's true because you're right, the FBI could put anything on those reports.
[2:45:43.600 --> 2:45:46.800]  Well, and I'll just say this again, I don't want to say too much. He'll make his own statements,
[2:45:46.800 --> 2:45:51.440]  but I'll just say back then they did try to cut deals with him to get him less jail time and he
[2:45:51.440 --> 2:45:56.480]  he didn't take him. He passed him. He did his full sentence. So that's right. So we don't believe
[2:45:56.480 --> 2:45:59.840]  anything the mainstream media says. Going back to Pete Santilla, who was a political
[2:45:59.840 --> 2:46:04.800]  president back in the Bundy ranch days. What other comments you want to relay to people about the
[2:46:04.800 --> 2:46:12.640]  season we're going into a false flags of violence of insanity. Listen, of course, rank and file FBI
[2:46:12.640 --> 2:46:17.040]  law enforcement. They're probably not involved in non-compromise, but they at the upper echelon.
[2:46:17.040 --> 2:46:23.760]  And I have firsthand experience. Bundy ranch was not a spontaneous event in April of 2014.
[2:46:23.760 --> 2:46:31.200]  They started creating the emotional pretext for an indictment in January of 2014. Now,
[2:46:31.200 --> 2:46:36.000]  do you remember Larry Grathwall? Larry Grathwall was an FBI informant. He was not an agent way
[2:46:36.000 --> 2:46:41.680]  back in the day. He infiltrated the the weather underground. I think all of us here and hopefully
[2:46:41.680 --> 2:46:46.800]  all of your listenership or law abiding citizens, we want to go get the bad guys. Larry Grathwall was
[2:46:46.800 --> 2:46:53.600]  the perfect FBI informant because he pursued the bad guys. If Enrique Terrio shared information
[2:46:53.600 --> 2:46:57.920]  about lawbreakers, I don't know the proud boys. I don't know of any proud boys that want to break
[2:46:57.920 --> 2:47:03.200]  the law, nor does Enrique Terrio. Let's expand on that. Now the weathermen are in control of the
[2:47:03.200 --> 2:47:08.800]  government. Grathwall, the Green Beret, a patriot, they recruited him at Columbia and he went in
[2:47:08.800 --> 2:47:13.520]  and it was like horrible. He did the right thing and went to the FBI. That's good. That's exactly
[2:47:13.520 --> 2:47:19.840]  right. Now, there's a lot of pressure on people and that's where I say you make the perfect FBI
[2:47:19.840 --> 2:47:25.280]  informant when they force 30 years upon you and say, well, if you'll cooperate, well, if you're
[2:47:25.280 --> 2:47:29.680]  of the integrity, I'm glad and I didn't know about this. I'm glad that Owen mentioned it,
[2:47:29.680 --> 2:47:34.320]  that he did not capitulate. I was asked, would you like to cooperate? I said,
[2:47:34.320 --> 2:47:37.840]  I have nothing to cooperate about it. I saw nobody breaking the law and I told
[2:47:37.840 --> 2:47:44.560]  the prosecutors to pound sand and that is a person of integrity is going to stand on the truth,
[2:47:44.560 --> 2:47:50.000]  of course. Now, there are individuals that will succumb to the pressure, unfortunately,
[2:47:50.000 --> 2:47:54.160]  and we have to vet the people that are around us. But like I said, the number one indication
[2:47:54.160 --> 2:48:00.320]  that you're around somebody that is either an informant that is setting you up for entrapment,
[2:48:00.320 --> 2:48:04.320]  because that's what they did through Bundy Ranch and the Malier National Wildlife Refuge,
[2:48:04.320 --> 2:48:11.200]  you will be entrapped by these people. The FBI uses those less than scrupulous people that
[2:48:11.200 --> 2:48:18.960]  are drug addicts or previous felons and so on and so forth. They'll use them to entrap you.
[2:48:18.960 --> 2:48:22.000]  So we have to be very, very careful. We're sitting on a powder. Absolutely. All right,
[2:48:22.000 --> 2:48:24.800]  Pete Santelli, I appreciate your time. How do people find your show?
[2:48:26.160 --> 2:48:30.400]  You get all of our links are at Pete Santelli.mobi. We're all over the place,
[2:48:30.400 --> 2:48:34.160]  well-diversified so that people can find us. We're being chased around the Internet just
[2:48:34.160 --> 2:48:39.200]  like everyone else is being being demonetized and deleted. But Pete Santelli.mobi.
[2:48:39.200 --> 2:48:41.840]  We'll talk to you again soon. We're out of time. Thank you, brother. Thanks for having me on.
[2:48:41.840 --> 2:48:46.000]  And again, I didn't want to spend, thank you, sir. I didn't want to spend two hours of the show,
[2:48:46.000 --> 2:48:51.680]  which we basically just did on this, but I was there. I witnessed it and I witnessed people
[2:48:51.680 --> 2:48:57.920]  being led into idiocy. And I just do not want to see this happen anymore. I want to politically
[2:48:57.920 --> 2:49:02.880]  challenge Joe Biden. Joe Biden's going to fail if we just politically challenge him. If we just
[2:49:02.880 --> 2:49:07.200]  have the states organize a new Declaration of Independence, if we just say you're a fraud,
[2:49:07.200 --> 2:49:10.880]  if we're peaceful, we're going to beat him. We have the people Trump won the landslide.
[2:49:10.880 --> 2:49:14.880]  They want to trick us into a violent revolution. If you think I'm wrong, don't listen, folks.
[2:49:14.880 --> 2:49:18.240]  That's fine. I don't think violent revolution is the answer. And listen,
[2:49:18.240 --> 2:49:22.240]  you know, you heard the Boogaloo guy. Oh, you're bad. You sell things. Well, yeah,
[2:49:22.240 --> 2:49:26.560]  I've got a network, satellite up links, TV, huge crew that's all paid well. We're trying to stay

[2:49:56.000 --> 2:49:59.840]  we're not here. You know, me, I'm not trying to win a popularity contest. I'm trying to beat the
[2:49:59.840 --> 2:50:05.120]  globalist. And so my job is to do what's unpopular and tell the truth upfront and not play games
[2:50:05.120 --> 2:50:08.720]  with this garbage. And that's my commitment. I'm not thinking about myself. I'm thinking about
[2:50:08.720 --> 2:50:12.960]  what happens to me at the end of the day, though I ask you to pray for us and keep us in the fight.
[2:50:12.960 --> 2:50:16.240]  So I'm a Troyer. I know we push the gami off. I want to hear from him. I don't know if he's
[2:50:16.240 --> 2:50:21.440]  coming up. And then we've got John Rappaport loaded for bear. You take over. Hopefully the
[2:50:21.440 --> 2:50:25.280]  gummies come on for a few seconds. If not, I don't know. And then we've got John Rappaport
[2:50:25.280 --> 2:50:29.920]  coming up in the war room. They'll all be hosting. I'm sure he's wound up listening to me for hours.

[2:51:29.600 --> 2:51:38.960]  The Pope came out yesterday and announced a global
[2:51:38.960 --> 2:51:44.480]  government corporate alliance to redistribute wealth and create a planetary universal income,
[2:51:44.480 --> 2:51:48.480]  which of course the United Nations and global corporations will control through the apps on
[2:51:48.480 --> 2:51:53.680]  your phone and finally a chip under your skin. It's all now completely official. Art of the
[2:51:53.680 --> 2:52:00.000]  UN great reset of the Davos group and Klaus Schwab, all officially written about in hundreds of books
[2:52:00.000 --> 2:52:05.200]  by Schwab and Rockefeller Foundation, all the rest of them, Agenda 21, Agenda 2030, it's here
[2:52:05.200 --> 2:52:10.640]  and only gets worse like being fed into a wood chipper or a meat grinder until you reject it all.
[2:52:12.320 --> 2:52:17.760]  And the rejection starts with realizing it's spiritual battle, diverse, evil and stopping
[2:52:17.760 --> 2:52:23.120]  abortion. We must start valuing human life again. We must start saying that we are not
[2:52:23.120 --> 2:52:30.480]  expendable, that we are not disposable, that we are essential. Until we do that, we are all slaves.
[2:52:30.480 --> 2:52:34.160]  We must stand up and declare our basic God given human rights now.
[2:52:39.920 --> 2:52:42.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:52:42.560 --> 2:52:52.000]  We're back here in the Info Wars World Headquarters in Austin, Texas.
[2:52:52.000 --> 2:52:58.080]  Owen Schreuer and Leo Zagami with you for about the next 20 minutes. I'm seeing all kinds of
[2:52:58.080 --> 2:53:05.520]  headlines out of Italy, the government collapsing, government officials stepping down. There seems
[2:53:05.520 --> 2:53:11.360]  to be some sort of even maybe not the best phrase, but like a cold civil war, a war of words,
[2:53:11.360 --> 2:53:16.720]  for sure happening. And so I always think of Leo Zagami from Italy did a lot of great work
[2:53:16.720 --> 2:53:22.480]  exposing the Vatican, his great books. We sell them at infowarstore.com and of course the greatest
[2:53:22.480 --> 2:53:29.440]  Italian-American accent in radio. So Leo Zagami joins me now. Leo, what is going on
[2:53:29.440 --> 2:53:35.200]  in Italy right now? Explain this to the audience. Well, it's very hard to explain something that
[2:53:35.200 --> 2:53:40.400]  even the Italians seem to have problems in explaining. I mean, I just saw the latest news
[2:53:40.400 --> 2:53:45.360]  and they're giving like five different kind of solutions to the problem, which is basically a
[2:53:45.360 --> 2:53:54.800]  crisis that was created by a friend of Joe Biden, Matteo Renzi, who with the arrival of Joe Biden
[2:53:54.800 --> 2:54:02.000]  in the White House, he obviously tried to create a crisis so he can get back in government in a
[2:54:02.000 --> 2:54:09.200]  leading position because his group, his political party, which only counts 3% of the national votes,
[2:54:09.200 --> 2:54:15.920]  is actually a non-existing party almost. But he's very influential because he's linked to both
[2:54:15.920 --> 2:54:22.080]  Barack Obama and Joe Biden. So Matteo Renzi has instigated this crisis. Giuseppe Conte was
[2:54:22.080 --> 2:54:27.600]  eventually forced to resign because he doesn't have the numbers anymore to conduct his government
[2:54:27.600 --> 2:54:37.040]  without this faction, this 3% faction led by Matteo Renzi. So we are in a crisis that of course
[2:54:37.040 --> 2:54:45.440]  has only a solution, a new government, but we don't know if now in the last couple of hours
[2:54:45.440 --> 2:54:50.640]  is going to be a new government with Giuseppe Conte because they want to get him out of the way
[2:54:50.640 --> 2:54:56.480]  after he received the famous endorsement by Donald J. Trump, President Donald Trump,
[2:54:56.480 --> 2:55:04.960]  who endorsed Giuseppe Conte. And this is a war that of course of words like you said,
[2:55:04.960 --> 2:55:12.240]  but there is a growing tensions in Italy because people are pretty desperate, the lockdowns are
[2:55:12.240 --> 2:55:19.600]  never ending. And so this political charade is not really appreciated by anybody. And the
[2:55:19.600 --> 2:55:25.680]  fear that all these parties have is to actually go to the elections because with the elections,
[2:55:25.680 --> 2:55:32.000]  the center right will definitely win with a large majority. And at that point, though,
[2:55:32.000 --> 2:55:37.680]  the European Union will force them out of government in one way or another because they
[2:55:37.680 --> 2:55:46.240]  don't want the center right. They want a pro-European force in charge of Italy now that the actual
[2:55:46.240 --> 2:55:53.520]  mess, this financial creature created by the European Union for the states that are victims
[2:55:53.520 --> 2:56:02.400]  of the pandemic. And that means billions of euros that are poured into the Italian finances.
[2:56:02.400 --> 2:56:12.240]  And of course, there must be a government which is close to Brussels to be able to send forward
[2:56:12.240 --> 2:56:19.360]  this project. So it's all about really the money that the European Union is sending to Italy and
[2:56:19.360 --> 2:56:26.560]  about not going back to the elections because they know that they're going to fail. People are
[2:56:26.560 --> 2:56:35.760]  really upset with the latest government, but they were also very much upset with the fact that
[2:56:35.760 --> 2:56:46.560]  they voted for a center right coalition to be in charge. And then last year, suddenly, there was
[2:56:46.560 --> 2:56:53.840]  the Matteo Salvini that was sent away and then they substituted his political party with the
[2:56:53.840 --> 2:56:59.280]  party that actually was at the opposition, the Democrat Party in Italy, which is, of course,
[2:57:00.640 --> 2:57:06.960]  conducted behind the scenes by people who are very close to both Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi,
[2:57:06.960 --> 2:57:13.200]  Nancy Pelosi, who regularly goes to Italy. She's Italian American and she is, of course,
[2:57:13.200 --> 2:57:20.880]  also very close to the Italian mob. And it seems like in the end, the guy who is in charge of it
[2:57:20.880 --> 2:57:26.880]  all is the Italian president, who I really dislike. He's Sicilian. I'm half Sicilian myself,
[2:57:26.880 --> 2:57:33.200]  but he is actually the son of a mobster, a real mobster. So the president of Italy is basically
[2:57:34.160 --> 2:57:40.320]  creating this new option. We'll come back, Leo. We're taking a break here. But the point is,
[2:57:40.320 --> 2:57:43.280]  populist uprisings are happening all over the world and the globalists hate it.
[2:57:45.760 --> 2:57:50.960]  President Trump won in a landslide on November 3rd, but the globalists weren't going to let that
[2:57:50.960 --> 2:57:57.200]  happen. They had to have some way to repudiate the populist movement, emanating from the United
[2:57:57.200 --> 2:58:03.520]  States that spread across the world from the UK to Brazil. They were desperate. They admitted
[2:58:03.520 --> 2:58:08.720]  their own publications. They didn't know what to do. And so they put out 80 million fake ballots
[2:58:08.720 --> 2:58:14.800]  violated state law and stole it better than Dallas. And now they're coming after the president.
[2:58:14.800 --> 2:58:19.040]  They're coming after you. They're coming after me. They're shutting everybody off the internet.
[2:58:19.040 --> 2:58:23.680]  They're trying to totally censor us. And that's why M4 Wars is still in the fight because we knew
[2:58:23.680 --> 2:58:28.000]  this was coming. We told you this was coming. We were the first main target that we're still on
[2:58:28.000 --> 2:58:33.840]  air at m4wars.com and newswars.com and band up with you. Without your word of mouth, without
[2:58:33.840 --> 2:58:37.840]  your prayer, without your financial support, we can't stay on air. So while you still can,

[2:58:41.440 --> 2:58:44.000]  stop them as you name it at m4wars.com.
[2:58:54.480 --> 2:59:02.640]  Live from the info wars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show. And now your
[2:59:02.640 --> 2:59:09.040]  host, Owen Troyer. Final segment that I'm here. I have Leo Zagami with me. John Rapport going to
[2:59:09.040 --> 2:59:16.640]  take over after this segment. You know, Leo Zagami with us here, LeoZagami.com.
[2:59:17.360 --> 2:59:22.400]  I think that the general notion here is, and you're trying to get into some of the details,
[2:59:22.400 --> 2:59:26.800]  but it's very confusing. I think for the whole world watching what's happening right now,
[2:59:27.520 --> 2:59:31.200]  including maybe for some people, what they're saying in America is probably confusing unless
[2:59:31.200 --> 2:59:38.240]  you really understand all the details. But as a general statement or a general kind of analysis
[2:59:38.240 --> 2:59:44.880]  here, you know, this is just another country like the United States or Brazil, Italy, Poland,
[2:59:44.880 --> 2:59:51.360]  that's having nationalistic populist uprisings against what they now see as a threat to their
[2:59:51.360 --> 2:59:57.520]  nation state sovereignty. So whether that's the UN, whether that's the EU, whether that's the medical
[2:59:57.520 --> 3:00:02.960]  tyranny that we're seeing now with the fake pandemic COVID that's gone worldwide, you know,
[3:00:02.960 --> 3:00:07.520]  that's what they're trying to stop from happening. And so they demonize the people like Trump,
[3:00:07.520 --> 3:00:13.520]  they demonize the people like Conti. And so that's the problem here is that you have the
[3:00:13.520 --> 3:00:18.240]  nationalistic uprising of people who are now aware of the New World Order, they don't want the UN,
[3:00:18.240 --> 3:00:23.120]  they don't want the EU, they vote themselves out of it, kind of like at Brexit. And then the
[3:00:23.120 --> 3:00:27.200]  establishment just says, no, you don't get that, you don't get to have Brexit, you don't get to have
[3:00:27.200 --> 3:00:32.800]  Trump, you don't get to have a resurgence of nationalism in Italy. And so it's just this,
[3:00:32.800 --> 3:00:38.160]  it's just kind of this push and this tug, you know, the old saying, an unstoppable force meets
[3:00:38.160 --> 3:00:43.040]  an immovable object. I mean, you know, that's the battle that we're seeing here. So what are the
[3:00:43.040 --> 3:00:49.120]  Italian people saying and thinking about this? I guess, aside from the confusion, I mean, because
[3:00:49.120 --> 3:00:53.200]  there was no doubt, I mean, Trump is massively popular, the most popular US president in modern
[3:00:53.200 --> 3:00:59.920]  day history, I think he got 75 million votes minimum. I mean, I'd even make the argument more than that
[3:00:59.920 --> 3:01:04.000]  with what we've seen with some of the machines flipping votes to Biden. I think Trump maybe
[3:01:04.000 --> 3:01:09.200]  got 80 million plus votes, but we know at least 75 plus million. So what are the people in Italy
[3:01:09.200 --> 3:01:13.600]  saying about this, you know, the nationalistic populistic uprising, which is just common sense,
[3:01:13.600 --> 3:01:20.480]  nation state sovereignty versus a global agenda? What are the people saying outside of the world
[3:01:20.480 --> 3:01:25.760]  words that's happening inside the collapsing government? Well, they are upset because you see
[3:01:25.760 --> 3:01:32.720]  Giuseppe Conte arrived into power thanks to the five star movement, which was perceived as populist.
[3:01:32.720 --> 3:01:40.480]  But after they kicked out Matteo Salvini, and then at that point, they placed this insane
[3:01:40.480 --> 3:01:46.960]  coalition with the Democrat Party, which was center left. The people are really disappointed
[3:01:46.960 --> 3:01:53.440]  with the five star movement. And they, of course, see as a last beacon of hope, the league of Matteo
[3:01:53.440 --> 3:02:00.560]  Salvini. But they are very worried because they want to place as a new prime minister, Mario Draghi,
[3:02:00.560 --> 3:02:07.200]  who worked for Goldman Sachs, who was the head of the European Central Bank, and who is the choice
[3:02:07.200 --> 3:02:14.640]  of the Illuminati. The Academy of the Illuminati in Rome has always pushed for Mario Draghi as
[3:02:14.640 --> 3:02:22.640]  prime minister. So he's a Jesuit creature, and probably ultimately he's going to go and substitute
[3:02:22.640 --> 3:02:28.320]  Giuseppe Conte if he's not capable of putting together now the third coalition
[3:02:29.520 --> 3:02:36.400]  possibility that he's trying to. But I think it's going to be very difficult for him because
[3:02:36.400 --> 3:02:41.040]  there is this Matteo Renzi guy who, of course, wants to become foreign minister now that his
[3:02:41.040 --> 3:02:49.680]  friend Joe Biden is in the White House. So these people are all part of the same global insanity,
[3:02:49.680 --> 3:03:00.080]  global New World order led by China that is, of course, destroying sovereignty and it's destroying
[3:03:00.080 --> 3:03:04.720]  populism because they perceive it as a very dangerous ideology. At the same time, we have,
[3:03:04.720 --> 3:03:12.000]  of course, the Vatican. The Vatican and the Pope, who has become more and more a political figure,
[3:03:12.000 --> 3:03:20.080]  criticizing any form of uprise, criticizing, of course, people who refuse the vaccine,
[3:03:20.080 --> 3:03:27.120]  and he himself took the vaccine because his personal doctor died on the 9th of January.
[3:03:27.120 --> 3:03:36.160]  But then, soon after, he started to feel sick after taking the vaccine. So now the Pope Shatik,
[3:03:36.160 --> 3:03:44.080]  which is this sickness, he's been suffering for years, is becoming actually worse after the vaccine.
[3:03:44.080 --> 3:03:50.560]  And there is a lot of worries in the Vatican because they didn't want the Pope to resign
[3:03:50.560 --> 3:03:58.560]  with Ratzinger still alive. Of course, it becomes then a political matter to elect the next Pope.
[3:03:58.560 --> 3:04:08.240]  But we know that Pope Francis has already nominated the right amount of cardinals to take
[3:04:08.240 --> 3:04:15.280]  over the next election and place another progressive Pope because that's what they want to do.
[3:04:15.280 --> 3:04:23.040]  And Davos, you mentioned Davos in your show. Of course, the Vatican also has given their support
[3:04:23.040 --> 3:04:32.240]  to the great reset, and it's more and more into this whole thing of destroying
[3:04:32.240 --> 3:04:36.880]  capitalists and substituting with communism. At the same time, there is more and more
[3:04:36.880 --> 3:04:45.200]  erases in the church that are not only tolerated but even promoted. We have had also an attack
[3:04:45.200 --> 3:04:53.520]  on a Catholic Church here in the United States a few days ago by Antifa during a pro-life mass
[3:04:53.520 --> 3:04:59.440]  that was conducted, I think, by an Archbishop. And it was in Ohio, and they stormed the church,
[3:05:00.080 --> 3:05:05.760]  and there were children present, and they were shouting profanities. And then we have also
[3:05:05.760 --> 3:05:16.080]  the Catholic LGBTQ community making a new movie about Jesus. And this is, of course,
[3:05:16.080 --> 3:05:22.240]  one year after what we have seen on Netflix, which was extremely controversial. This new movie
[3:05:22.240 --> 3:05:34.320]  is titled Wonderfully Made, an LGBTQ religion. And basically, this film made by a film director
[3:05:34.320 --> 3:05:42.800]  who is Jewish but is married to a Catholic husband is all about saying, basically, that Jesus
[3:05:42.800 --> 3:05:50.080]  has suffered just like us, and that if Jesus was here today, he will be protecting and working
[3:05:50.080 --> 3:05:56.320]  mainly for the LGBTQ community. I know that this sounds insane, but in this film, there is actually
[3:05:56.320 --> 3:06:03.520]  a Jesuit who appears in this film, and he's very famous amongst the gay community. And there is
[3:06:03.520 --> 3:06:12.160]  even an openly gay priest who works for Black Lives Matter. So this is becoming really totally
[3:06:12.160 --> 3:06:19.760]  insane. On one side, we see that they storm churches and they create, basically, they are
[3:06:20.400 --> 3:06:27.200]  fighting pro-life priests. And instead, they are supporting openly gay people who are priests.
[3:06:27.200 --> 3:06:32.960]  Yeah. And that's just a form of intimidation. It's like, oh, you know, be pro-LGBTQ or, you know,
[3:06:32.960 --> 3:06:38.800]  your church may get burned to the ground. And, you know, it's a weird thing because I was raised
[3:06:38.800 --> 3:06:43.040]  Catholic. I grew up Catholic. Catholics really used to look up to the Pope. I mean, Pope John
[3:06:43.040 --> 3:06:47.600]  Paul II was a hero in the Catholic community. Now, like, the Pope isn't even influential on
[3:06:47.600 --> 3:06:51.520]  Catholics. Like, they've just, I mean, it's like, it doesn't even exist. Nobody looks to the Vatican
[3:06:51.520 --> 3:06:57.440]  for leadership anymore. So the Catholic Church is kind of a lost in a way. But Leo, and by the way,
[3:06:57.440 --> 3:07:02.320]  you've made the prediction that they're going to announce probably by before the end of the year
[3:07:02.320 --> 3:07:07.440]  that that African cardinal is going to be the next Pope. But in the last 90 seconds here, Leo,
[3:07:07.440 --> 3:07:11.840]  make a prediction. What do you think happens with the current situation? What's the conclusion of
[3:07:11.840 --> 3:07:19.040]  the current situation of the Italian government? The Italian situation is simply a charade. In a
[3:07:19.040 --> 3:07:26.080]  way, you know, we see different kinds of charades being taken place here in the U.S. You unfortunately
[3:07:26.080 --> 3:07:33.200]  see what has happened in Washington DC. In Italy, they haven't managed to riot or rebel in the same
[3:07:33.200 --> 3:07:40.080]  way. But they, of course, are taking away the interest of people from the main subject, which
[3:07:40.080 --> 3:07:47.760]  is being locked down in your own house. So all these political circles in the end serves only
[3:07:47.760 --> 3:07:54.720]  the purpose, the main purpose is to keep to distract people because people, if they start
[3:07:54.720 --> 3:08:00.720]  thinking about the way they are oppressed and the fact that they have to continuously pay tax
[3:08:00.720 --> 3:08:05.920]  and continuously fill the system, which is completely corrupt and doesn't give any hope for
[3:08:05.920 --> 3:08:14.320]  them, eight bars and restaurants out of 10 in northern Italy. And this is an official news
[3:08:14.320 --> 3:08:21.600]  that is being reported yesterday. We'll go bankrupt. So that means that the Italian economy
[3:08:21.600 --> 3:08:30.640]  is really on the verge of some very big problems and the people are getting more and more upset.
[3:08:30.640 --> 3:08:52.320]  So how are you going to control these people? Well, they simply silence them with censorship.
[3:09:01.440 --> 3:09:07.920]  for years at infowarstore.com years never raised the price, never the wake up America blend,
[3:09:07.920 --> 3:09:12.960]  the best coffee, the crew here loves it. We drink it every day. And of course, that's just one of
[3:09:12.960 --> 3:09:18.320]  the great ways you can support info wars here. Everybody drinks coffee or just about everybody.
[3:09:18.320 --> 3:09:23.200]  Why not support info wars and keep the coffee supply at your house with the wake up America
[3:09:23.200 --> 3:09:27.760]  Patriot blend. Of course, read all the great reviews, pretty much perfect review there. 4.9 star
[3:09:27.760 --> 3:09:31.680]  when you have thousands of reviews, it's impossible to have a perfect review unless
[3:09:31.680 --> 3:09:35.520]  literally everybody gives it five stars. So I mean, if you have 4.9, that's pretty much everybody
[3:09:35.520 --> 3:09:40.320]  gives it a five star except maybe one or two people. Patriot blend 100% organic coffee only
[3:09:40.320 --> 3:09:47.920]  available at info wars store.com. We have the technocrats are controlling the food supply,

[3:10:33.200 --> 3:10:36.960]  getting prepared. It starts with self defense. It starts with being prepared. It starts with
[3:10:36.960 --> 3:10:48.800]  horrible food. It starts with digging in the long globalist fight. You'll want in the end. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:10:48.800 --> 3:11:10.800]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:11:10.800 --> 3:11:19.920]  And now your host, John Rappaport. Here we are folks to be with you again here at info wars,
[3:11:19.920 --> 3:11:27.280]  John Rappaport. Bleeding with a story today, which is a tip of the iceberg video from
[3:11:28.400 --> 3:11:34.960]  a man who states that he is a nurses assistant at a nursing home. It's obviously been working
[3:11:34.960 --> 3:11:41.600]  there for a while. And he is making the claim that many people are dropping like flies
[3:11:42.400 --> 3:11:49.280]  in the nursing home after they're being injected with a COVID vaccine. He is saying that some of his
[3:11:50.960 --> 3:11:57.520]  patients, people that he has been caring for have been dying. Others who were walking
[3:11:57.520 --> 3:12:12.240]  are now not able to walk. Some are no longer able to talk. So I would ordinarily say, okay,
[3:12:12.240 --> 3:12:20.240]  so let's exercise extreme caution here because we can't verify that this account is absolutely true.
[3:12:20.240 --> 3:12:27.680]  But there is common sense data to back it up, which I have been supplying for months and
[3:12:27.680 --> 3:12:38.400]  months and months now. And that is the following. In the major clinical trials of the vaccine,
[3:12:40.160 --> 3:12:48.320]  it's pretty obvious that the elderly and frail were not accepted as volunteers in the clinical
[3:12:48.320 --> 3:12:57.040]  trials. Therefore, there was no way to tell what the effects of the experimental vaccine were on
[3:12:57.040 --> 3:13:04.720]  these people who are the people who are living in nursing homes, who are now being pushed close
[3:13:04.720 --> 3:13:12.800]  to the front of the line to receive the COVID vaccine. Now, if people who are ordinarily
[3:13:12.800 --> 3:13:21.120]  fairly healthy, who are receiving the vaccine are reporting adverse events, and we're seeing this
[3:13:21.120 --> 3:13:28.480]  breaking out all over the world, unable to perform daily duties, can't go to work,
[3:13:29.760 --> 3:13:37.040]  and then presumably supposedly they recover, and these are people who are either very healthy or
[3:13:37.040 --> 3:13:44.480]  fairly healthy. Then what do you expect is going to be the effect of this vaccine on people who
[3:13:44.480 --> 3:13:51.840]  start out being frail, elderly, suffering from multiple health conditions for many years,
[3:13:52.640 --> 3:14:00.640]  have been treated for many years with toxic medications? What do you think is going to happen
[3:14:00.640 --> 3:14:10.320]  to this? It's obvious from a common sense point of view that many of them are going to
[3:14:11.840 --> 3:14:19.520]  become even more seriously ill, and many of them are going to die. We're talking about the forced,
[3:14:20.480 --> 3:14:27.520]  early premature death of these people, the killing of these people via the vaccine,
[3:14:27.520 --> 3:14:31.200]  murder. That's what we're talking about.
[3:14:34.400 --> 3:14:40.960]  I expect this story to be gaining a significant amount of force very quickly
[3:14:41.680 --> 3:14:49.040]  in the upcoming days and weeks, as reports leak out from nursing homes about what is happening
[3:14:49.040 --> 3:14:57.520]  to the frail and elderly who are getting the vaccine. Again, just use your common sense.
[3:14:57.520 --> 3:15:04.400]  What do you think is going to happen to these people who were excluded from the clinical trials
[3:15:04.400 --> 3:15:10.880]  of the vaccine for obvious reasons that the pharmaceutical companies did not want to have
[3:15:10.880 --> 3:15:17.280]  these people folding up and dying when they get the vaccine during the clinical trials?
[3:15:17.280 --> 3:15:27.040]  They were excluded. Well, they're not excluded now. This is not a clinical trial. This is a
[3:15:27.040 --> 3:15:35.600]  vast guinea pig experiment on a global basis using a technology that has never been brought
[3:15:35.600 --> 3:15:45.520]  to market before called RNA technology. It's been tried and it's failed to come to market. Why?
[3:15:45.520 --> 3:15:52.960]  Why? Because of the adverse effects on the people that it's been experimented with,
[3:15:54.000 --> 3:16:05.680]  talking mainly about serious autoimmune reactions. The body basically attacks itself.
[3:16:05.680 --> 3:16:23.600]  If you have people who are in these nursing homes, be aware of this information. I can't
[3:16:23.600 --> 3:16:37.040]  overstress it. Now, on a somewhat related note, I want to point to the shocking research of a
[3:16:37.040 --> 3:16:44.240]  woman from Canada named Christine Massie. She and her colleagues for many months now
[3:16:45.040 --> 3:16:52.320]  have been sending Freedom of Information Act requests to public health agencies in Canada
[3:16:52.320 --> 3:17:03.680]  and in other parts of the world. Very specific requests to provide records that prove and show
[3:17:04.960 --> 3:17:14.480]  that the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has ever really been isolated from a diseased patient.
[3:17:14.480 --> 3:17:28.480]  And in these FOIA requests, the conditions are very clearly spelled out. We're talking about
[3:17:31.280 --> 3:17:41.040]  the SARS-CoV-2 virus being separated out from any surrounding material, any other viruses,
[3:17:41.040 --> 3:17:46.640]  bacteria, cellular material, genetic debris, et cetera, et cetera.
[3:17:48.640 --> 3:17:56.720]  Requesting that these public health agencies come through and provide records that show
[3:17:57.760 --> 3:18:06.320]  that this purported virus SARS-CoV-2, which is said to be the cause of a worldwide pandemic,
[3:18:06.320 --> 3:18:17.360]  has ever really truly been isolated from a patient. Translation has it ever really been proved to exist.
[3:18:20.960 --> 3:18:28.160]  So as I recently reported at No More Fake News, what Christine Massie and her colleagues have
[3:18:28.160 --> 3:18:38.720]  discovered, in 46 separate cases where they submitted these FOIA requests to public health
[3:18:38.720 --> 3:18:47.120]  agencies in Canada and other parts of the world, the number of records that were returned to them,
[3:18:47.120 --> 3:18:58.720]  supposedly proving that this virus has ever been isolated, is zero. Zero, zero, zero records
[3:18:58.720 --> 3:19:07.120]  have been produced in 46 separate instances. Typical reply goes something like this,
[3:19:07.120 --> 3:19:17.760]  we have no records at the agency here that would satisfy your request. Now this is completely
[3:19:17.760 --> 3:19:24.640]  astonishing. Talking about, yeah, there's a website for those of you who are watching here,
[3:19:24.640 --> 3:19:32.720]  Fluoride Free Peel. These public health agencies are admitting that they have no records proving
[3:19:32.720 --> 3:19:41.680]  that the virus has ever been isolated. And this isn't just one agency, 46 will be back after the break.
[3:19:41.680 --> 3:19:46.880]  We told you it was coming. Under the United Nations pilot program in Singapore, for eight months they
[3:19:46.880 --> 3:19:52.480]  made citizens wear bracelets on their arms that make some social distance and report them back
[3:19:52.480 --> 3:19:56.400]  to cell towers to track through every movement. This is for everybody, the way that it's better.
[3:19:57.040 --> 3:20:01.280]  Now France has programs in their factories, government push and sponsor,
[3:20:01.280 --> 3:20:06.480]  to make everyone wear actual dog collars that can make you social distance and report back to
[3:20:06.480 --> 3:20:11.120]  single computers. They're turning us into a commodity. Human animal clones have been around
[3:20:11.120 --> 3:20:16.240]  for 50 years. It's all being announced. They are literally taking over the life cycle of humans
[3:20:16.240 --> 3:20:21.120]  and making us obsolete. And big corporations downplay that they own us with the gene therapy
[3:20:21.120 --> 3:20:26.320]  systems and patents that they produced. Do you understand? It is a takeover of the entire
[3:20:26.320 --> 3:20:30.720]  species at the genetic level and now they're coming with dog collars and they're announcing
[3:20:30.720 --> 3:20:36.080]  public schools in the U.S. Starting next year it will begin. Did you hear me? Dog collars for
[3:20:36.080 --> 3:20:40.720]  your children all based on a hoax, all based on a lot. Imple Wars will continue to spread the word to
[3:20:40.720 --> 3:20:47.840]  fight back. Due to the COVID lockdown destroying the supply chain, many of the best selling products
[3:20:47.840 --> 3:20:52.000]  in Imple Wars are no longer available. And I thought that pollen block might be gone forever,
[3:20:52.000 --> 3:20:58.320]  but after eight months we got about 25% of the order we put in delivered to us. The rest they
[3:20:58.320 --> 3:21:05.600]  hope in a few months comes in. It's a proprietary system using specially fed quail and their eggs.
[3:21:05.600 --> 3:21:11.120]  It's very powerful when it comes to blocking seasonal irritants and a lot more. So get your

[3:21:44.720 --> 3:21:48.880]  mineral fusion has sold out because people understand in these stressful times it's now
[3:21:48.880 --> 3:21:52.640]  more important than ever to boost your body's natural defenses. But here's the good news.

[3:21:59.760 --> 3:22:05.280]  And we've got two great tumeric formulas. One is body's ultimate tumeric formula that is a dried
[3:22:05.280 --> 3:22:10.640]  tumeric extract 95% humanoid. People love it. That's selling out. But despite that,
[3:22:10.640 --> 3:22:16.320]  it's still discounted at infowarstore.com. And then also selling out this week is our liquid
[3:22:16.320 --> 3:22:21.200]  tumeric extract. It's called liquid tumeric extract. People really love it. It's extremely
[3:22:21.200 --> 3:22:26.880]  strong as well. It's selling out. And your purchase doesn't just help yourself and your body. It also
[3:22:26.880 --> 3:22:31.440]  funds the info war and keeps us on air while they're trying to shut everybody down. So thank you all

[3:22:41.280 --> 3:22:48.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:23:11.520 --> 3:23:12.160]  Bravo boy.
[3:23:15.120 --> 3:23:19.920]  Back in the second segment here, I've got two stories concerning Biden and Trump.
[3:23:21.520 --> 3:23:25.760]  Perhaps you've noticed that some of the governors are now talking about, well,
[3:23:25.760 --> 3:23:32.160]  we're going to loosen up the lockdown somewhat now. And because statistics show that blah,
[3:23:32.160 --> 3:23:37.040]  blah, blah, no, the statistics, which are all fake anyway, are not showing anything.
[3:23:37.040 --> 3:23:44.640]  It's obvious that, well, Biden has been installed as president. So now we've done our job. The
[3:23:44.640 --> 3:23:51.360]  governors are thinking. And so now we can start loosening up the lockdowns because obviously part
[3:23:51.360 --> 3:24:02.160]  of the whole scenario here was ensuring that Titanic numbers of mail-in ballots would be used
[3:24:02.160 --> 3:24:09.360]  in the election, which would make stealing it very much easier and keeping people at home
[3:24:09.360 --> 3:24:16.560]  rather than showing up at the polls, which shows you the, I mean, this is, I mean, the depth,
[3:24:17.440 --> 3:24:27.040]  the depth of the need to get rid of Trump, the depth of that operation to get rid of him. Of
[3:24:27.040 --> 3:24:34.320]  course, we've seen over the past five, six years, predating his election in the first place,
[3:24:34.320 --> 3:24:40.320]  how serious that move was. But when you consider that, oh, it's very serious lockdowns. They've
[3:24:40.320 --> 3:24:44.720]  got a lockdown. Everybody locked down. Everybody. Oh, Biden's like, okay, well, you know, actually,
[3:24:44.720 --> 3:24:51.200]  we can loosen up the lockdowns a little bit now for now anyway. And we do need to open up the
[3:24:51.200 --> 3:25:03.840]  economy above. I mean, talk about cynical criminality on the part of these grotesque, hideous, gargoyle
[3:25:03.840 --> 3:25:13.520]  governors. It's absolutely astounding. And so from there, we move to the impeachment process now
[3:25:13.520 --> 3:25:23.440]  taking place in the US Senate to impeach Trump. It reminds me, if you remember the old comedy
[3:25:23.440 --> 3:25:32.880]  Animal House, where the Dean tells the fraternity, actually, you've been on, what did he call it,
[3:25:32.880 --> 3:25:40.880]  something like super secret probation. And you violated your probation. So therefore,
[3:25:40.880 --> 3:25:52.480]  you're banned from campus. I mean, this impeachment trial, you know, raising serious constitutional
[3:25:52.480 --> 3:26:05.840]  questions. Come on. This is like a mock trial being staged at some hokey law school, which barely
[3:26:05.840 --> 3:26:14.240]  is able to graduate students. And the mock trial is being put on and carried out by the worst of
[3:26:14.240 --> 3:26:25.040]  those students, parading as if they're really lawyers, and in this case, really legislators in
[3:26:25.040 --> 3:26:34.720]  the Senate. I mean, the whole thing has absolutely no value, meaning whatsoever, except propaganda
[3:26:34.720 --> 3:26:44.080]  value for extreme yokels and rubes, who actually think that the Constitution has something to say
[3:26:44.880 --> 3:26:52.080]  about impeaching a president who has already left office. When in fact, all you have to do is read
[3:26:52.080 --> 3:27:02.240]  the Constitution and you see a that the impeachment trial has only to do with removing a sitting
[3:27:02.240 --> 3:27:12.960]  president, not a president who is no longer sitting, but has left the presidency and be that this
[3:27:12.960 --> 3:27:22.560]  impeachment trial has to be presided over by the head of the Supreme Court, Chief Justice,
[3:27:22.560 --> 3:27:27.760]  which in this case is John Roberts, who has said that he's not going to preside over this,
[3:27:27.760 --> 3:27:34.560]  and that he really doesn't care to comment on why not. I mean, you know, this guy is supposed
[3:27:34.560 --> 3:27:40.960]  to be the number one lawyer in the country. So you would think that if he is saying,
[3:27:40.960 --> 3:27:48.240]  I'm not going to preside over this impeachment trial, that he's going to make a statement about
[3:27:48.240 --> 3:27:58.960]  why not to inform the people of America what, that the trial is a sham, that it isn't legitimate,
[3:27:58.960 --> 3:28:05.120]  it isn't constitutional, it isn't legal, it has absolutely no merit or meaning whatsoever,
[3:28:05.120 --> 3:28:10.720]  that it's nothing more than a propaganda exercise being carried out by rhinos and Democrats,
[3:28:10.720 --> 3:28:19.200]  that he's going to say something. But he refrains, yes, he refrains. And of course,
[3:28:19.200 --> 3:28:28.000]  the media are going along with the following narrative. Well, you see, if it were an impeachment
[3:28:28.000 --> 3:28:35.920]  of a sitting president, then the Chief Justice of Supreme Court Roberts would be presiding.
[3:28:35.920 --> 3:28:44.640]  But since this is a different sort of impeachment, then Patrick Leahy, who has been serving in the
[3:28:44.640 --> 3:28:52.640]  Senate as a Democrat since 1843, he is stepping up to the plate to preside over this different
[3:28:52.640 --> 3:28:59.040]  kind of impeachment. Yeah, the different kind of impeachment, which is no impeachment whatsoever,
[3:28:59.040 --> 3:29:06.880]  which is at best a mock trial being carried out by idiots, which has no meaning whatsoever under
[3:29:06.880 --> 3:29:17.120]  the Constitution, no legal value, nothing whatsoever to do with fact or law in the United States. But
[3:29:18.960 --> 3:29:23.360]  rhinos and Democrats are very seriously pretending
[3:29:23.360 --> 3:29:29.600]  that it does, in fact, have something to do with a legal procedure,
[3:29:32.640 --> 3:29:39.600]  which tells you something about these people and their character, right? Okay, boys and girls,
[3:29:39.600 --> 3:29:46.160]  now here's the deal. Keep a straight face when you talk to the press. Don't break out in a grin.
[3:29:46.160 --> 3:29:52.640]  Don't start laughing uncontrollably when you say that we're going to stage an impeachment
[3:29:52.640 --> 3:30:00.080]  of a president who is no longer president in contravention of the Constitution. And that,
[3:30:00.080 --> 3:30:06.240]  the Chief Justice is not going to preside, but we're going to take one of the oldest hack jobs
[3:30:06.240 --> 3:30:12.640]  in the Senate, Pat Leahy, and we're going to prop him up and put him there at the head to
[3:30:12.640 --> 3:30:20.720]  preside over this fake trial. Don't break up laughing and smiling and grinning and falling down
[3:30:20.720 --> 3:30:26.240]  because you can't stop laughing. You've got to keep a straight face about the whole thing
[3:30:26.800 --> 3:30:34.800]  as we proceed in impeaching the president who is not a president who is now a private citizen,
[3:30:36.400 --> 3:30:42.960]  right? And even if this fails, which it looks like it's going to,
[3:30:44.240 --> 3:30:49.520]  to get a two-thirds vote from the Senate, keep in mind, boys and girls, that we can always come
[3:30:49.520 --> 3:30:57.280]  back after the midterm elections if we get enough rhinos and Democrats to make it happen again.
[3:30:57.280 --> 3:31:03.920]  And we can impeach Trump 30 years from now if we have to, whatever it takes to completely erase
[3:31:03.920 --> 3:31:09.520]  Hib and all of his supporters as if they never existed because they're dangerous,
[3:31:10.240 --> 3:31:16.560]  because they're extremely dangerous, because for one reason or another, we don't know why
[3:31:16.560 --> 3:31:21.520]  they care about something called freedom, which we're in the process of completely
[3:31:21.520 --> 3:31:28.000]  outlawing in every form that we can possibly think of so that we make everybody into slaves,
[3:31:28.000 --> 3:31:37.600]  et cetera, et cetera. That's the picture, folks. That's what's going on with the so-called
[3:31:37.600 --> 3:31:40.480]  impeachment that is taking place now in the Senate.
[3:31:40.480 --> 3:31:50.320]  And again, as I'm turning a page here in my notes, I have to take the lawyers to task. I'm talking
[3:31:50.320 --> 3:31:56.160]  about not the lawyers in the country who are speaking out and saying that the whole thing
[3:31:56.160 --> 3:32:02.800]  is a sham and a farce, but the thousands of other lawyers who know it's a sham and a farce
[3:32:02.800 --> 3:32:08.240]  and are not saying anything. I'm not talking about the fact that they have to file cases
[3:32:08.240 --> 3:32:13.360]  and courts. They have to write. They have to speak out. They have to do podcasts. They have to go
[3:32:13.360 --> 3:32:19.360]  on shows. They have to say the whole thing is illegitimate. It's unconstitutional. It's insane,
[3:32:19.360 --> 3:32:26.240]  and any bar association that doesn't say it's insane loses all credibility. Why aren't they
[3:32:26.240 --> 3:32:32.800]  speaking up? Because they're cowards, because they're fakes and frauds. That's why, because
[3:32:32.800 --> 3:32:40.480]  they don't deserve to be called attorneys. We'll be back. Don't go anywhere after the break here.
[3:33:03.760 --> 3:33:07.920]  with the best natural ingredients to help not only improve your quality of sleep,

[3:33:44.480 --> 3:33:51.280]  They are forcing mutations. This is forced evolution, more de-evolution. When you look at
[3:33:51.280 --> 3:33:55.760]  all the major research, all the major programs they're carrying out, they are not to produce
[3:33:55.760 --> 3:34:01.520]  people that are smarter or folks that live longer or more oral. No, it's turning humanity into a
[3:34:01.520 --> 3:34:07.440]  commodity. Now we see some propaganda like communist China bragging, hey, we've done the mRNA vaccines
[3:34:07.440 --> 3:34:12.960]  to make our soldiers superman. That's a way to make it sexy that, hey, we're experimenting on our
[3:34:12.960 --> 3:34:17.680]  troops. We'll send things with that into our troops and thousands and thousands of died each
[3:34:17.680 --> 3:34:22.640]  time they tried the new experimental vaccine. I've talked to high-level folks inside the federal
[3:34:22.640 --> 3:34:26.960]  government and the state of Texas health department. They say, Alex, you know it hurts a lot of people
[3:34:26.960 --> 3:34:31.440]  that's for a greater good, but that's not even true. And it violates the Geneva Convention,
[3:34:31.440 --> 3:34:36.160]  the Nuremberg Code, federal state law. This is violence being carried out against us by
[3:34:36.160 --> 3:34:39.600]  that of the tyranny and we have a right to resist it with any means necessary.
[3:34:41.600 --> 3:34:47.200]  Our activated charcoal toothpaste became a best-seller overnight because activated charcoal is
[3:34:47.200 --> 3:34:51.440]  already one of the top-selling fastest-growing toothpaste out there. The problem is a lot of
[3:34:51.440 --> 3:34:56.320]  the other over-the-counter ones have aspartame as their flavoring, very, very toxic. And also,
[3:34:56.320 --> 3:35:00.240]  they have fluoride in it. This does not have the fluoride, it doesn't have the additives.
[3:35:00.240 --> 3:35:05.040]  This is a concentrated, it really is, high-quality. It's been sold out for months because of supply
[3:35:05.040 --> 3:35:09.920]  chain breakdowns with the whole COVID martial law garbage, but now it's back in stock.
[3:35:09.920 --> 3:35:15.840]  Info Wars, Dr. Jones Naturals, activated charcoal toothpaste. Now back in stock at

[3:35:34.240 --> 3:35:38.560]  of other products that have been sold out have just now come back in as well, like pollen block,
[3:35:38.560 --> 3:35:44.000]  so check that out when you're in the store. I've got some bad news. Our best-selling
[3:35:44.000 --> 3:35:48.080]  vitamin mineral fusion has sold out because people understand in these stressful times,
[3:35:48.080 --> 3:35:52.320]  it's now more important than ever to boost your body's natural defenses. But here's the good news.
[3:35:52.960 --> 3:35:59.360]  Turmeric acts in very similar ways and is so good for inflammation, so good for your immune system,
[3:35:59.360 --> 3:36:04.960]  and we've got two great turmeric formulas. One is body's ultimate turmeric formula that is a dried
[3:36:04.960 --> 3:36:10.720]  turmeric extract, 95% humanoid. People love it. That's selling out. Despite that, it's still
[3:36:10.720 --> 3:36:16.560]  discounted at infowarstore.com. And then also selling out this week is our liquid turmeric
[3:36:16.560 --> 3:36:21.760]  extract. It's called liquid turmeric extract. People really love it. It's extremely strong as well.
[3:36:21.760 --> 3:36:26.880]  It's selling out. And your purchase doesn't just help yourself and your body. It also funds the

[3:36:53.760 --> 3:37:00.240]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:37:00.240 --> 3:37:09.120]  Okay, last segment here this hour.
[3:37:12.880 --> 3:37:19.360]  Gotta say something about Biden. This is another one of these.
[3:37:20.880 --> 3:37:23.200]  How can we possibly believe this?
[3:37:23.200 --> 3:37:36.800]  Talking about the mental incapacity of the man. In 1980, he suffered a brain aneurysm
[3:37:37.920 --> 3:37:46.400]  and pulmonary thrombosis, had two surgeries. This was very serious. It wasn't some little
[3:37:46.400 --> 3:38:00.480]  light business here. And to anybody but the slumbering his mental cognitive decline was obvious.
[3:38:01.840 --> 3:38:08.400]  There have been numerous videos made. You're looking at one who, if you're watching now with a pen,
[3:38:08.400 --> 3:38:11.120]  where I put the pen, how do I get it in my pocket?
[3:38:11.120 --> 3:38:21.360]  He's walking out past a line of marines and he says, salute the marines. But he doesn't salute them.
[3:38:23.600 --> 3:38:28.320]  He's listening. It appears to somebody in his earpiece saying salute the marines.
[3:38:29.040 --> 3:38:34.640]  But instead of saluting them, he repeats what they're telling him. I mean, it just goes on and on.
[3:38:34.640 --> 3:38:47.760]  This was apparent long ago to any except the slumbering. It was apparent when he announced
[3:38:47.760 --> 3:38:54.320]  for the presidency, it was apparent during the campaign. If you want to call it a campaign,
[3:38:54.320 --> 3:39:02.560]  I mean, he was talking with dozens of people who would show up at these little rallies and so forth.
[3:39:02.560 --> 3:39:08.080]  With very, very light campaigning, minimal to keep him away from the public.
[3:39:10.080 --> 3:39:18.640]  And gaffes and confusions and incoherence and so on and so forth. My point being,
[3:39:18.640 --> 3:39:35.600]  during the campaign, did any rhino, Republican, seriously hammer on this as being very dangerous?
[3:39:35.600 --> 3:39:48.720]  Did any mainstream media outlet hammer on this? Say, hey, we're in the process of possibly
[3:39:48.720 --> 3:39:58.000]  electing and stalling a seriously impaired man as the next president of the United States.
[3:39:58.000 --> 3:40:12.320]  A disabled human. Where are his medical records? We understand they're confidential and so forth.
[3:40:12.320 --> 3:40:20.400]  But you see, when somebody is running as a candidate for a major party for the presidency
[3:40:20.400 --> 3:40:29.680]  of the United States, doesn't it stand to reason that we have a right to know whether he is coherent?
[3:40:32.000 --> 3:40:42.560]  Whether he is cognitively challenged on a physical level to a very serious degree and is in rapid
[3:40:42.560 --> 3:40:53.840]  decline? Yes, no. Are we not able to find out this information? Because from all outward signs,
[3:40:53.840 --> 3:41:00.640]  that's what we're seeing. Doesn't matter if he's Democrat, Republican, Libertarian,
[3:41:01.520 --> 3:41:10.080]  constitutional party, Martian party. What difference does it make? This guy could be
[3:41:10.080 --> 3:41:17.520]  elected as the next president, and we demand to know, and we are not going to stop demanding to
[3:41:17.520 --> 3:41:28.480]  know. And I pointed this out in articles at the time. The guy is in serious trouble. That's what
[3:41:28.480 --> 3:41:36.560]  you would say if he was just another guy. He can't remember. He can't articulate. He's
[3:41:36.560 --> 3:41:46.720]  confusing one thing with another. We're on the verge, possibly, of electing or installing or
[3:41:47.520 --> 3:41:53.280]  faking our way into putting this man in the Oval Office.
[3:41:58.960 --> 3:42:04.400]  But media outlets are under orders to stay away from this. Don't bring it up, etc., etc.,
[3:42:04.400 --> 3:42:10.320]  don't even mention it. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. This is the only Democrat with any kind
[3:42:10.320 --> 3:42:17.520]  of name recognition who isn't considered too radical on the left, like Sanders or Warrant,
[3:42:18.080 --> 3:42:24.160]  to even have a chance at the presidency, and we have to shut up about it, and we can't talk about
[3:42:24.160 --> 3:42:29.360]  it. We can't bring it up, and that's the gesture, etc., and now we look around, and there is this
[3:42:29.360 --> 3:42:43.200]  guy sitting in the Oval Office. I mean, when people say that America is beginning to look like a joke
[3:42:43.200 --> 3:42:51.600]  in the eyes of other nations, and they cite various ridiculous reasons for saying that,
[3:42:51.600 --> 3:42:59.840]  here's an actual reason for saying, look what they did in America. They elected this guy, and I'm not
[3:42:59.840 --> 3:43:13.520]  even confident that he knows his name all the time. It's just beyond appeal. It's beyond belief.
[3:43:13.520 --> 3:43:22.960]  With a guy like that, it doesn't matter what his policies are, because does he remember what his
[3:43:22.960 --> 3:43:32.800]  policies are? Does it matter? Because he's obviously being controlled as a puppet on strings by a
[3:43:32.800 --> 3:43:39.680]  committee, by people behind him, and those of you watching see a picture of Biden from the early
[3:43:39.680 --> 3:43:48.000]  years before, I would say, the surgeries and so forth. I watched him in the old, old, old, old days
[3:43:49.520 --> 3:43:55.920]  on the Sunday talk shows, where he was a frequent guest as a foreign policy wonk
[3:43:57.200 --> 3:43:59.520]  in the Senate, because he's been in the Senate forever.
[3:44:02.080 --> 3:44:09.360]  He was a sharp talker. I didn't agree with what he was saying or his policies, but he was a
[3:44:09.360 --> 3:44:17.120]  sharp talker. He was quick. One of the usual idiot hosts would ask him a softball question,
[3:44:17.120 --> 3:44:22.240]  and he would give you the answer. Here's what Russia's actually been doing, and this is what
[3:44:22.240 --> 3:44:29.520]  we have to do. Here we've tried these negotiations, whatever it is. He was fully cognizant, aware of
[3:44:29.520 --> 3:44:40.960]  his mental capacity, and was exercising it. But all of that has completely changed, and America
[3:44:40.960 --> 3:44:51.760]  has descended, at least half of it anyway, into the depths of such idiocracy that an entire presidential
[3:44:51.760 --> 3:45:00.880]  campaign could be conducted, and nobody in major media or major politics hammers on the fact,
[3:45:01.440 --> 3:45:09.280]  relentlessly over and over again, that we have to see this guy's records, medical records,
[3:45:09.280 --> 3:45:17.360]  because we could be electing somebody who is medically incompetent, who is severely disabled.
[3:45:17.360 --> 3:45:29.040]  As the president. It didn't happen. It didn't happen at all. Yeah, there were occasional mentions
[3:45:29.040 --> 3:45:34.560]  of this, and people would giggle on and say, can you believe this, Skyliner? I'm not talking about
[3:45:34.560 --> 3:45:48.880]  that. I'm not talking about that. This gives you an indication of where the hypnotic level and the
[3:45:48.880 --> 3:45:55.920]  IQ level of at least half the country have sunk, and you could say, well, they just didn't care,
[3:45:55.920 --> 3:46:00.560]  because all they wanted to do was get rid of Trump, and it didn't matter which Democrat
[3:46:00.560 --> 3:46:12.080]  they dragged across the finish line. In this case, it was by, yeah, true. But again, the man is severely
[3:46:12.720 --> 3:46:25.600]  disabled, meaning totally unreliable in what he says, thinks, remembers, signs,
[3:46:25.600 --> 3:46:34.160]  you know, as an executive orders, signs, advocates from day to day.
[3:46:39.280 --> 3:46:44.080]  And I can hear people saying, well, yeah, but, you know, so what?
[3:46:44.080 --> 3:46:57.200]  Yeah, so what? So what? I mean, of course, it's obvious, Kamala Harris is waiting in the wings
[3:46:57.200 --> 3:47:03.360]  to take over when Biden is unable to finish his term and all of that. We understand all of this
[3:47:03.360 --> 3:47:09.280]  New World Order accelerates, etc., etc., but I'm just getting to the ground level factor.
[3:47:09.280 --> 3:47:19.440]  The nation has to be rescued from basic idiocracy completely, thinking people
[3:47:19.440 --> 3:47:40.320]  have to think and speak out on every level as to what is going on. John Macklin was here. We're in for wars.
