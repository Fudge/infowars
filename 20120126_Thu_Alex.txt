[00:00.000 --> 00:12.240]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.240 --> 00:40.640]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:42.240 --> 01:04.120]  Well I won't back down no I won't back down you can stand me up at the gates of hell
[01:04.120 --> 01:19.440]  but I won't back down no I'll stand my ground won't be turned around and I'll keep this world from
[01:19.440 --> 01:36.160]  dragging me down gonna stand my ground and I won't back down hey baby there ain't no easy way
[01:36.160 --> 02:06.080]  and I won't back down okay we are here ladies and gentlemen and we're gonna officially kick
[02:06.080 --> 02:11.320]  off the broadcast after this first break some stations do not carry these first little five
[02:11.320 --> 02:19.360]  minute segments but I have a strange radio clock because I basically changed an official
[02:19.360 --> 02:27.080]  clock because I didn't feel like having to have government propaganda news posing as corporate
[02:27.080 --> 02:34.080]  news funneled at people in the first five minutes of an hour and so we provide this first five
[02:34.080 --> 02:40.160]  minutes every day in every hour and a lot of the stations do actually carry this five minutes
[02:40.160 --> 02:46.320]  and it gives us more time but then there's a little three-minute break for stations to have
[02:46.320 --> 02:54.360]  their commercials when we do go to break but another very important transmission lined up today
[02:54.360 --> 03:03.040]  a Newt Gendritch is in deep trouble the Politico did get it right he's being torpedoed by the Drudge
[03:03.040 --> 03:09.400]  Report last night and today any time you want to destroy Newt Gendritch you can they haven't
[03:09.400 --> 03:17.880]  even trotted out his stuff he's written in essays and the forward to Alvin and Heidi Toffler is
[03:17.880 --> 03:22.720]  one of their books I've read on air where he calls for basically the end of the family world
[03:22.720 --> 03:29.600]  government the end of US sovereignty and that he's part of a kind of globalist Marxist creepoid
[03:29.600 --> 03:35.440]  futurist society that's why the globalist chose him ran him for Congress originally in Georgia
[03:35.440 --> 03:43.560]  and that he is a Clintonista ringer everybody in Congress has always known this to to take
[03:43.560 --> 03:50.720]  conservative and libertarian revolutions and flush them down the toilet but now all these
[03:50.720 --> 03:56.600]  witnesses are coming out about how much he hated Ronald Reagan and how much he was basically a blue
[03:56.600 --> 04:06.200]  blood with George Herbert Walker Bush helping to torpedo when he was in Congress real tax cuts
[04:06.200 --> 04:13.040]  and real cutting of government and it's just par for the course so I'm glad all those chickens are
[04:13.040 --> 04:21.240]  coming home to roast the problem is the Republican establishment I don't think is going after Newt
[04:21.240 --> 04:27.440]  because you've got Ann Coulter doing it you've got a national review doing it you've got them
[04:27.440 --> 04:34.520]  all going after him right now they're going after him because I guess he's a threat to
[04:34.520 --> 04:41.960]  Mitt Romney and they also know it scares them when Nancy the criminal Pelosi the insider trading
[04:41.960 --> 04:49.040]  skunk says oh he'll never be president I'll destroy him I've got the dirt like the witch
[04:49.040 --> 04:57.040]  they know she's not bluffing so they are a torpedoing the demon generous right now and I can't
[04:57.040 --> 05:03.520]  say I'm sad about that hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now

[08:39.840 --> 08:47.400]  larger contingents of a British naval fleet are entering areas around the Strait of Hormuz
[08:47.400 --> 08:55.720]  openly telling Tehran don't think about closing the Strait of Hormuz now that an oil shipment
[08:55.720 --> 09:05.240]  export embargo has been placed on the nation Iran is vowing at an unspecified time officially via
[09:05.240 --> 09:13.400]  their government organs like press TV to close the Strait of Hormuz that is big news we've got
[09:13.400 --> 09:20.080]  news pouring out of Davos that we're gonna be going over where the the world's elite that's
[09:20.080 --> 09:24.920]  French news agency headline I thought that didn't exist I thought that was a conspiracy theory I
[09:24.920 --> 09:31.080]  mean if you say the sky's blue and it's not given government pointy-head bureaucrat approval you
[09:31.080 --> 09:35.880]  know the sky's not blue the Sun doesn't affect climate the UN says so and that sounds like a
[09:35.880 --> 09:42.680]  joke it's not a joke that's equivalent of saying the sky isn't blue unless they say so so all of
[09:42.680 --> 09:47.800]  that is going on and it is a definitely crazy we're gonna be breaking that down the Davos forum
[09:48.360 --> 09:53.160]  I sit basically admitting we're going into a global depression when the head of the IMF
[09:53.160 --> 10:00.120]  has said again give them over 100 trillion of your tax money give the banks that engineered the
[10:00.120 --> 10:07.640]  collapse and created the derivatives in the fraud give them the galactic size basically
[10:07.640 --> 10:15.880]  infinity paycheck of your money and in turn things may not be as bad and they'll run your life
[10:15.880 --> 10:21.880]  and jack up your taxes and lecture you and standardized police and military forces worldwide
[10:22.520 --> 10:29.160]  to absolutely destroy all basic liberties and freedoms and arrest anyone that criticizes them
[10:29.160 --> 10:34.520]  and shut down web freedom it's all being announced by these criminal tyrants as they sit up there
[10:34.520 --> 10:42.280]  in their big mafia meeting with their corporate prostitute paid for decepticon cesspool cessstream
[10:43.800 --> 10:49.880]  trader media telling us how lucky we are to have these crooks destroying our society
[10:51.560 --> 10:56.600]  now you'll remember about a month ago paul watson did an article where google admitted that
[10:56.600 --> 11:03.000]  they're removing youtube videos that are quote anti-government or critical of the government
[11:03.000 --> 11:09.720]  in the u.s this is now happening and of course google has announced that they're going to
[11:09.720 --> 11:15.640]  de-list people they want to off the web and they're going to push down search rankings and
[11:15.640 --> 11:21.080]  they're going i mean here's an example just a few months ago if you typed in straight of hormush
[11:21.080 --> 11:26.760]  you would get taeron times press tv top of google news when you click the news function
[11:26.760 --> 11:32.440]  because obviously that's the real news out of iran that's the authority and and whatever gets the
[11:32.440 --> 11:40.200]  most hits in the old algorithm the most views the most most traffic it goes to the top not anymore
[11:41.320 --> 11:47.000]  now you don't find press tv or taeron times anywhere near the top in fact last time i checked
[11:47.000 --> 11:52.760]  two days ago you couldn't even find it as a listener pointed this out for two years info wars dot
[11:52.760 --> 11:59.720]  com and prison planet dot com big news sites known the world over the biggest alternative media sites
[11:59.720 --> 12:06.280]  in the world unless you count drudge report as an alternative media site which is much
[12:06.280 --> 12:10.440]  bigger than our sites combined but we're the biggest if you don't count the drudge report
[12:11.720 --> 12:15.880]  all of that is of course drudge is bigger than new york times twitter and facebook combined and
[12:15.880 --> 12:21.640]  and new york times admits that so i mean it's in a class of its own the point is that we're not there
[12:21.640 --> 12:27.240]  you you you go to the news you want news alerts you click on it you can see other news articles
[12:27.240 --> 12:32.120]  attacking us are talking about us but you will not see us there and now they're beginning to
[12:32.120 --> 12:36.920]  delist us and move us out of the main searches we're already in fact we've seen the notices
[12:38.040 --> 12:43.800]  from a consulting company we've got that looks at it that we've been lowered in the rankings
[12:43.800 --> 12:50.600]  as we get bigger as we win in the info war as as that supposed level playing field
[12:50.600 --> 12:58.040]  uh algorithm is removed we are removed and of course here's the washington post yesterday
[12:58.040 --> 13:05.160]  google announces privacy changes across products users can't opt out and it goes on to say that
[13:05.160 --> 13:11.400]  the web giant is going to basically be tracking everything you do and sharing it and that privacy
[13:11.400 --> 13:21.240]  groups are concerned and are upset about this so that's what we've got going on on that front
[13:22.360 --> 13:26.920]  consumers won't be able to opt out of the changes which take effect march first and experts say the
[13:26.920 --> 13:32.200]  policy shift will invite greater scrutiny from federal regulators of the company's privacy and
[13:32.200 --> 13:37.320]  competitiveness practices yeah they already only pretty much try to send you to their sponsors
[13:37.320 --> 13:42.760]  the people that pay them uh and so it's totally skewed they were free and open using nsa
[13:43.640 --> 13:48.280]  software that they were built on 12 years ago and that's on record and cia funding through
[13:48.280 --> 13:54.680]  in cutel on record and now that they've got most the web under their control
[13:56.120 --> 14:02.840]  and are dominating and and you know taking over cell phones smartphones every different facet
[14:02.840 --> 14:09.880]  that you can imagine across the interwebs now they're coming in and and by the way my it people
[14:09.880 --> 14:14.280]  have already pointed out before we saw these articles that they're already seeing google doing
[14:14.280 --> 14:20.440]  this it's already integrating it's already telling other people that that google knows that you know
[14:20.440 --> 14:29.160]  that hey bob search this alex search that max search this uh it is it is so incredibly creepy
[14:29.160 --> 14:34.280]  and it just teaches everybody that you have no privacy you have no rights i mean we've gone in
[14:34.280 --> 14:47.640]  this system from the media and the government acting like you're an insane person if you
[14:48.280 --> 14:52.760]  say that anybody's watching you or tracking you or violating your privacy to just yeah the
[14:52.760 --> 14:59.080]  government listens to everything you do and face scans you and uh and does voice print and uh is
[14:59.080 --> 15:03.640]  tracking everything and and and does have the teacher at your school spying on your kids
[15:03.640 --> 15:07.800]  and your kids are being trained to spy on you and write papers on you and your pastor works
[15:07.800 --> 15:13.080]  for the government spying on you and all of this is happening now i'm going to get more into that
[15:13.080 --> 15:18.920]  but curtain demo is doing a story on this right now london telegraph government inquiry google
[15:18.920 --> 15:25.800]  asked to remove dozens of web pages for national security now the headline i'm going to talk to
[15:25.800 --> 15:33.320]  curtain the break the headline should be uk d notices grow worldwide and a d notice
[15:34.680 --> 15:43.560]  a d notice is when um a reporter reports uh that witnesses saw police dragging the body of
[15:43.560 --> 15:51.960]  of dr kelly the head weapons inspector who was clearly killed he said i've been threatened to
[15:51.960 --> 15:56.680]  be killed if i don't shut up but he said there are no wmds we're being lied to so they killed him
[15:56.680 --> 16:00.920]  and when and when it came out some local news that people saw the body being drugged there
[16:00.920 --> 16:07.400]  it was just d notice and i've been on bbc radio before and they'll just laugh at me and say that
[16:07.400 --> 16:11.080]  never happened even though i have a copy of the articles even though i've talked to members of
[16:11.080 --> 16:17.560]  parliament even though 90 plus percent of brits now know dr david kelly was murdered i go on bbc
[16:17.560 --> 16:25.560]  radio and the host laughs at me knowing full well i'm telling the truth they are literally
[16:25.560 --> 16:32.520]  winston smith working for big brother destroying truth and replacing it with lies i was listening
[16:32.520 --> 16:38.680]  to bbc radio on xm i monitor random stuff driving home yesterday stuck in traffic for about 45 minutes
[16:38.680 --> 16:46.920]  and on three different interview sections they were worshiping communist and socialist from
[16:46.920 --> 16:52.120]  different parts of the world in different news pieces how great they were and then they cut to
[16:54.520 --> 17:00.440]  uh john luke bachard's the actor uh is the character's name i forget what what's that
[17:00.440 --> 17:09.960]  actor's name shakesperian actor yeah patrick stewart is on and i and i got home and didn't
[17:09.960 --> 17:16.200]  get to hear the whole thing and he was giggling and and snickering and and and gibbering about
[17:16.200 --> 17:25.720]  how great socialism was the whole time i mean it is so creepy that that we've got just the general
[17:25.720 --> 17:31.080]  public being completely brainwashed and there they are selling socialism like it's for the
[17:31.080 --> 17:38.600]  average person when the ultra rich have always pushed socialism the british royalty created it
[17:38.600 --> 17:44.360]  and and then pushed it as a false opposition to themselves to socialize the general wealth
[17:44.360 --> 17:50.440]  to control society make people dependent on the state and to shut down competition and i have to hear
[17:50.440 --> 17:58.440]  her this person gibbering about how great socialism is and being padded on the head
[17:58.440 --> 18:04.680]  by the deceptive operative doing the interview and and and to hear stewart rolling over like a
[18:04.680 --> 18:12.200]  dog on his back showing his belly in glee that she's creamily smacking her lips i mean it is sick
[18:13.320 --> 18:18.760]  you see most people aren't just watching tv and obsessed with issues with no significance
[18:18.760 --> 18:24.680]  they're living in dream worlds where they play out these little fantasy lands these little dress
[18:24.680 --> 18:31.720]  up games with themselves about who they are they never even live and that's what i found with a lot
[18:31.720 --> 18:36.280]  of actors they're that way they're not real people that's why they're good actors because they can
[18:36.280 --> 18:46.360]  step in to this imaginary fruitcake world but here it goes uh google they report uh is now
[18:46.360 --> 18:50.680]  now shutting down web pages including stuff in other countries
[18:53.560 --> 18:59.720]  when the british filthy murdering criminal pedophile government involved in every crime
[18:59.720 --> 19:04.040]  you can imagine just the most sickening miscreant trash the earth has ever seen
[19:05.880 --> 19:11.720]  whenever they want it they shut down the web and and and that brings us to the next big super

[24:15.720 --> 24:23.960]  by the way in just the last week we've gotten 12 new stations but i was just in a partial list of
[24:23.960 --> 24:29.960]  these i want to dig out the albuquerque station there's a whole bunch of others before i even plug
[24:29.960 --> 24:36.040]  these i tell you it's good to have the problem of getting so many stations you you you have to
[24:36.040 --> 24:42.200]  scramble just to promote them all but wonderful folks out there so before the hour is over i'm
[24:42.200 --> 24:47.400]  going to compile because i know it's it's 12 stations the last two weeks but there's like six
[24:47.400 --> 24:53.880]  or seven others and so will you pull out of that list uh the ones that aren't on here because i
[24:53.880 --> 25:01.320]  noticed that um some of them aren't on here but uh very exciting uh man it's a good thing we're on
[25:01.320 --> 25:07.320]  some am and fm terrestrial stations because the way the internet censorship's going people

[25:15.000 --> 25:21.960]  what's happening uh here's a headline experts google privacy shift will have a greater impact
[25:21.960 --> 25:27.480]  on android users and then it goes on to basically admit that you're not going to be able to opt out
[25:28.040 --> 25:33.000]  of them location uh pinging where you're at that's going to be given to everybody
[25:34.760 --> 25:39.080]  it's just hellish and there's going to be so many robberies and so many murders
[25:39.080 --> 25:44.520]  and and and and so many horrible things i mean already people don't think and and and put on
[25:44.520 --> 25:49.160]  facebook where they live and oh look at my new computer look at my new stereo look at my new
[25:49.160 --> 25:56.040]  diamond ring and they get robbed an hour later and uh people finding out where you shop and what you
[25:56.040 --> 26:05.400]  do uh it is so creepy so that's just some of the news on that front and imagine google gets everybody
[26:05.400 --> 26:12.440]  addicted to using them and has all this data and depending on how you read this terms of service
[26:12.440 --> 26:20.040]  agreement they're talking about linking this new information up with all the old data and that's
[26:20.040 --> 26:25.320]  what my it people are telling me that they already noticed a few weeks ago was that is that google
[26:25.320 --> 26:33.080]  was already doing what facebook's doing i mean you go on facebook and it says identify this person
[26:33.080 --> 26:37.800]  for security so you can access your facebook and it's showing you somebody from high school you
[26:37.800 --> 26:42.760]  went to high school with that you haven't talked to in 20 years and you're like how does it know that
[26:44.920 --> 26:52.040]  i mean that's happening in this office just to use our facebook and what it's doing is it's getting
[26:52.040 --> 26:58.920]  you to give it human intelligence to integrate and to confirm that data and so it's sourcing data
[26:58.920 --> 27:07.400]  it's a giant spy vacuum cleaner and now google is going to be doing all of this i am not going
[27:07.400 --> 27:13.080]  to use google anymore i've always known it's bad i've pointed that out but uh most even the proxy
[27:13.080 --> 27:20.040]  servers uh proxy sites end up using google but they just shield you uh through the proxy while
[27:20.040 --> 27:24.120]  you're doing it but i'm going to do more research we're going to do some special reports the next
[27:24.120 --> 27:29.400]  few weeks and reviews uh but i've got to check with my it people and i'm going to check with some
[27:29.400 --> 27:37.000]  outside consultants i'm going to check with um dr stallman and i'm going to try to talk to dekla
[27:37.000 --> 27:42.600]  mccullough of a cnet news get his take on it and i'm going to really try to do some real research
[27:44.200 --> 27:47.240]  because you know i'm an expert on the new world order and all these systems when it gets down to
[27:47.240 --> 27:53.960]  little technical things like that i'm going to do a review and i'm going to tell you the top 10
[27:53.960 --> 27:59.960]  alternative search engines and we're going to launch a google boycott it's time uh we've been
[27:59.960 --> 28:03.400]  using their systems against them but they're really starting to clamp down and we've got to
[28:03.400 --> 28:09.480]  build up the alternatives quickly now continuing again they're working with the british government
[28:09.480 --> 28:14.840]  to shut down websites that that criminal system doesn't want the public to see google received
[28:14.840 --> 28:19.400]  65 requests from government to remove web pages from its database in the first half of the year
[28:19.400 --> 28:24.920]  the levinson inquiry has learned national security was the single biggest category among the reasons
[28:24.920 --> 28:29.720]  cited for wanting pages removed from google search results the company's legal director said
[28:32.280 --> 28:38.120]  it says uh who flew from the u.s to give evidence to the inquiry and media standards
[28:38.120 --> 28:45.160]  said that google had complied with the request 82 percent of the cases having heard evidence
[28:45.160 --> 28:50.600]  from the newspaper editors and journalists over the last month lord justin levinson
[28:51.320 --> 28:55.320]  turned his attention to online news providers to help him address the issue of how best
[28:55.320 --> 29:00.120]  to achieve the level playing field between print and online media when it comes to regulation
[29:00.120 --> 29:04.280]  see the newspapers are complaining that they're under total government control
[29:04.280 --> 29:11.480]  denotus is every day and the denotus is secret i mean i remember paul watson and articles on this
[29:11.480 --> 29:17.240]  that we thought it was a denotus when you type london bombing or bombings in on google news
[29:17.240 --> 29:23.160]  and on google web our articles were number one being read by millions of people a day
[29:23.160 --> 29:27.640]  we couldn't hardly keep the servers up in the weeks after the bombing and our articles were
[29:27.640 --> 29:33.160]  proving it was a government setup well suddenly we were just delisted on that particular but google
[29:33.160 --> 29:39.160]  got tired of just delisting us on particular things and so it's on i mean but there you go
[29:39.160 --> 29:44.840]  total proof now that's nothing i'm gonna explain why all this is coming out in the open now

[33:27.080 --> 33:32.680]  process is ongoing but then you've got to put that into action because the global crime syndicate
[33:32.680 --> 33:40.680]  is involved in a revolution against our laws not just in the united states but worldwide
[33:40.680 --> 33:49.080]  that have always protected the population from tyranny every basic liberty is being assaulted

[34:07.960 --> 34:14.360]  because the crooks know they've got to fully dominate us and keep us down it's like that line
[34:14.360 --> 34:20.440]  from a bug's life in fact try to cue that up if you can uh it's a bug's life uh you know uh
[34:20.440 --> 34:28.200]  grasshopper talks about keeping the uh the ants down he says he says if you let one of those little
[34:28.200 --> 34:35.080]  ants stand up a thousand might stand up and so it's not about food it's about dominating them
[34:35.080 --> 34:40.520]  and letting them know we're the boss because the grasshoppers are all sitting around going boss
[34:40.520 --> 34:43.800]  who cares about that little ant standing up to you let's just stay here and pick out on all
[34:43.800 --> 34:48.760]  this grain and he's like oh you're not worried about one little ant he throws a one grain at him
[34:49.400 --> 34:53.640]  and it bounces off his chest he goes no see it's no big deal he goes how about another one ah no
[34:53.640 --> 34:59.640]  big deal and he pulls a lever and dumps a big container of grain on him that basically crushes
[34:59.640 --> 35:06.040]  him he says how about that how about a thousand of them and so they're sitting around going how
[35:06.040 --> 35:12.040]  do we federalize america how do we train people to let us forcibly inoculate them how do we train
[35:12.040 --> 35:16.440]  people there's no fourth amendment how do we get rid of the middle of rights and constitution how do
[35:16.440 --> 35:19.800]  we get rid of the tenth amendment and train everybody to have the military on the streets
[35:19.800 --> 35:24.360]  and domestic checkpoints well we'll just start having drills everywhere and we'll get the boys
[35:24.360 --> 35:30.280]  scouts involved and have them in the community helping hunt for guns and when we start doing it
[35:30.280 --> 35:37.880]  in 1995 that's the earliest we found it with the boy scouts we'll say it's for overseas but by 98
[35:37.880 --> 35:46.680]  we'll admit it's for america we do have cases in in 87 of marines dressed up in army and army
[35:46.680 --> 35:54.600]  dressed up in police uniforms raiding gun shops we've confirmed that in norfolk virginia and other
[35:54.600 --> 36:00.680]  areas so they're very quiet secret operations at first just to beta test and commit the crime
[36:01.400 --> 36:07.480]  of federal troops involved in america i mean it's a serious crime or was a crime and then to just
[36:07.480 --> 36:14.600]  slowly beta test slowly learn and now in the month of january and february there are more
[36:14.600 --> 36:24.680]  than 100 steve was in an article on this yesterday 100 giant us army drills and marine corps drills
[36:25.240 --> 36:32.840]  inside us cities locking down entire areas and you're of course seeing it announced in your town
[36:32.840 --> 36:38.440]  and i've been at these i mean they'll have troops walk over with guns and say turn your camera off
[36:38.440 --> 36:45.320]  they will then suddenly go live and set up checkpoints on highways and pull you and your family
[36:45.320 --> 36:51.560]  out i mean it is so sick just like katrina and they're just getting all the cops ready all the
[36:51.560 --> 36:56.520]  military ready they're finding out who speaks out putting them in a file okay you're getting
[36:56.520 --> 37:03.800]  rotated to du cleaning of tanks you're getting sent to afghanistan boy you don't like pulling
[37:03.800 --> 37:08.280]  go like pulling that family out of that car you're going to wander in a month while you get sent to
[37:08.280 --> 37:15.400]  cyberia and it's the old joke and then they're just building their army of of of wicked people
[37:15.400 --> 37:19.640]  that'll do this now most of the military that are saying they will fire on citizens are not evil
[37:20.280 --> 37:25.640]  they're very very stupid this is about three years ago i was in new york and i ran into
[37:26.280 --> 37:31.960]  repeatedly i had regular army and national guard run across the street at me when i videotape them
[37:31.960 --> 37:35.400]  and yell and cuss and threaten to physically attack me it's in my film in game
[37:36.680 --> 37:40.280]  and i bowed up and just said go ahead do whatever you're gonna do you traitor a scum
[37:40.280 --> 37:45.800]  they had you know their guns on their hips and everything and then they would kind of freak out
[37:47.000 --> 37:51.160]  and then the cops would come over and then their commander would say no no no you know it's not time
[37:51.160 --> 37:58.280]  yet but i noticed that in a lot of cases they were total gangbanger types or it was very sad
[37:58.280 --> 38:04.680]  i know that they must have i'm not trying to be mean to folks because it's very sad you know when
[38:04.680 --> 38:08.920]  this happens but definitely some of the troops i would go up to and talk to in the subwaves
[38:09.640 --> 38:15.720]  had some type of chromosomal problem you could see them they look different it it in fact i ran
[38:15.720 --> 38:20.520]  into two guys that i guess the military must allow a certain type i know there's a lot of
[38:20.520 --> 38:25.240]  different chromosomal problems but they looked the same and they and they had speech impediments
[38:25.240 --> 38:35.160]  and i they've no way they had above 75 IQs and so they've also i guess they figure it's more
[38:35.160 --> 38:39.640]  powerful at least than the combat droids they've got right now so they're go ahead and and they're
[38:39.640 --> 38:44.600]  going to use some of those front line now of course i also told you they're not joking
[38:45.400 --> 38:51.720]  that what a decade ago that the pentagon said by 2012 half of the forces in the air
[38:51.720 --> 39:03.000]  air force air force your navy air forces army air force a marine core air power that half of
[39:03.000 --> 39:09.080]  it would be drone and they also said that of that they want to have a large percentage
[39:09.960 --> 39:15.240]  that was going to be autonomous where it's just programmed and sent out that has now happened
[39:15.240 --> 39:22.520]  by 2020 they want to have over 90 drone and half the ground force is going to be robot so and you
[39:22.520 --> 39:27.400]  will be in 2020 if we're still in the air i doubt that of this if they keep going forward looks like
[39:27.400 --> 39:34.520]  guys aren't gonna be on the air but the message has been sent so we'll be in your mind but the point
[39:34.520 --> 39:43.000]  is that half the ground force in eight years is going to be robots and they haven't been showing
[39:43.000 --> 39:49.080]  these to a lot of people uh because it freaks folks out i knew from marine core sources 14 years
[39:49.080 --> 39:54.200]  ago that they didn't just have swords uh but they've got stuff for psychological operations
[39:54.200 --> 39:59.560]  that's meant to scare people you see when you see something like terminator you think that's a movie
[40:00.200 --> 40:05.880]  and that and that the government's imitating art no no the arts imitating life that's all
[40:05.880 --> 40:10.120]  predictive programming i've talked to high-level military people when i brought up what i was
[40:10.120 --> 40:17.320]  told by some marines and others that yes they've got basically tracked creatures but then on top
[40:17.320 --> 40:22.280]  of it they've got multi armed systems that look like something out of terminator and they've even
[40:22.280 --> 40:28.680]  got some of them skull heads on top they find that really scares people so they've got and they've
[40:28.680 --> 40:33.880]  got uh many tanks that and i've actually seen it in the hollow loo advertiser did an article on it
[40:33.880 --> 40:37.560]  a few years ago but i've been told about it when it was classified and it's like a mini tank about
[40:37.560 --> 40:43.160]  the size of a big dodge pickup but it's got treads and uh it's got emergency wheels under
[40:43.160 --> 40:47.800]  that can come out of those get damaged and there was like 15 guns on the front of it i mean it was
[40:47.800 --> 40:54.040]  like a tank a kid would draw it looked like science fiction tanks i would draw as a child
[40:54.040 --> 40:57.960]  because i like you know science fiction i draw like you know science fiction army tanks with
[40:57.960 --> 41:04.280]  like 15 guns on the front it it's just unlimited money our money to just build unlimited armies
[41:04.280 --> 41:08.760]  against us and because they know there's been big debates about getting pilots out of the
[41:08.760 --> 41:12.600]  aircraft and it's not going to be humans going to space it's not going to be humans in jet
[41:12.600 --> 41:18.440]  aircraft it's not going to be humans fighting it's going to be big floating fortresses that
[41:18.440 --> 41:23.160]  come up next to your country that's got a bunch of human technicians that work on the robots
[41:23.160 --> 41:30.680]  that work on the robots and then big giant helicopters and ospreys and other land uh
[41:30.680 --> 41:38.440]  uh ship lander's land and this gorge basically treaded 18 wheelers that then pull up into the
[41:39.000 --> 41:44.440]  the area and dump out a bunch of killer robots and they've got them skull heads they've got big
[41:44.440 --> 41:49.240]  spiders uh everything and of course you'll see these soon i mean they're already showing some of
[41:49.240 --> 41:54.280]  them uh they did a lot of hard kill slaughter on families all over iraq with the little primitive
[41:54.280 --> 42:01.000]  swords throwing hangar nades you ejecting hangar nades they launch them and machine gunning 50 cal
[42:01.000 --> 42:06.360]  they've got robot hum v's that are remote control already seven states have legalized 18 wheelers
[42:06.360 --> 42:11.640]  driving around that have no no driver it's just similar to that it's already happening and basically
[42:11.640 --> 42:16.360]  helicopter flies over drops a bunch of little mini spiders that are basically hangar nades they come
[42:16.360 --> 42:24.040]  up to where you're at blow up they've got race specific nanotech bio weapons that self-destruct a
[42:24.040 --> 42:28.520]  few hours after they've been released supposedly that's going to stop blowback it's not even really
[42:28.520 --> 42:34.280]  a virus it's more of an artificial nanotech that kills you they've got of course at least hundreds
[42:34.280 --> 42:38.840]  of airborne super weapons that kill over 90 of those that come in contact with them and that's
[42:38.840 --> 42:42.520]  why they don't care that you know and have congressional hearings about government run
[42:42.520 --> 42:47.640]  child kidnapping rings and nobody gets in trouble uh that's why they don't care that you know they're
[42:47.640 --> 42:52.840]  running torture camps worldwide that's why they have the troops on on fox news growing the opium
[42:52.840 --> 42:57.000]  they'll soon have robots to do that and the troops are all freaked out they were having
[42:57.000 --> 43:01.240]  mutinies over there that was coming out about the drug dealing and the troops being ordered to load
[43:01.240 --> 43:07.240]  the heroin on to be flown into america and europe and so they just said get get the troops on bbc
[43:07.240 --> 43:13.160]  singing in abc fox news and you can see the news clips just type in government admits opium being
[43:13.160 --> 43:17.960]  grown and it's got the troops all standing around and the kernels out there yeah we grow the opium
[43:18.520 --> 43:22.520]  what we do and everybody's kind of we're not glad about it but okay and and the troops are like
[43:22.520 --> 43:27.560]  well i guess it's on tv it's okay see they were in the old system where they thought it was illegal
[43:27.560 --> 43:36.200]  which it is but see now it's just a throw it in your face and that's why these people are such
[43:36.200 --> 43:45.800]  such scum is because it's all funny to them and only a huge awakening now and only a refusing the
[43:45.800 --> 43:53.160]  system and only a realizing that our own destruction i mean i was reading these contracts they got a
[43:53.160 --> 43:58.040]  lot of these robots built in united states canada in england europe but a lot of the components
[43:58.040 --> 44:03.320]  are built in china and i mean think of the crooks they have unlimited money they've got unlimited
[44:03.320 --> 44:08.680]  trillions that they make up out of nothing that we prop up with our taxes and they've already got the
[44:10.600 --> 44:15.960]  air forces of the four branches half converted over to drones and they're getting ready to
[44:15.960 --> 44:23.320]  convert almost all the others except for meat carriers and again the military themselves
[44:23.320 --> 44:28.280]  are brainwash sleep deprivation shaved heads cult programming developed by the germans that's
[44:28.280 --> 44:34.760]  what it is they're just biological androids but they have a soul so they can wake up your obsolete
[44:34.760 --> 44:40.760]  you're gone you're done you're given a soft kill du serving you're given soft kill vaccines
[44:40.760 --> 44:45.480]  you're listed as the top enemy because they know that you tend to actually become conscious
[44:45.480 --> 44:50.520]  because you're not just an animal you're not just an android they can keep you in an android state
[44:50.520 --> 44:56.520]  in a mesmerized brainwash whoo-hoo football state but you can break out of it so you're slated as the
[44:56.520 --> 45:03.080]  number one enemy because in the future war when we face the robots and the roid head swat teams
[45:03.080 --> 45:08.840]  backing them up that sit there like cowards a mile away you know driving up the little tank with the
[45:08.840 --> 45:16.040]  shotgun howitzer blowing your house up and as the zit face you know kids sit there just overseeing
[45:16.040 --> 45:20.840]  they'll be like butlers to the drones and robots you know just there as a backup in case there's
[45:20.840 --> 45:25.240]  any glitches you know they'll be there to hit the override and self-destruct on them and just
[45:25.240 --> 45:31.720]  nothing but sniveling scum of every type killing the last generation of servants they themselves
[45:31.720 --> 45:37.480]  like every tyrant does will be killed and then it's just phasing in the mass bio weapons releases
[45:43.080 --> 45:47.800]  and man you think about it they've just got these giant warehouses of drone helicopters
[45:47.800 --> 45:53.640]  with the nerve gas on them drone helicopters with the bio weapons and that's what's really scary
[45:53.640 --> 45:57.800]  is that after they've staged all the terror attacks and clamped down on society and got
[45:57.800 --> 46:01.640]  everybody reporting on their neighbors to get some credits to get some food and reporting on
[46:01.640 --> 46:06.040]  their neighbors to get some you know to turn their guns in to get some food after we're deep
[46:06.040 --> 46:14.600]  into this in a fully broken servile pathetic society the warehouse is open the helicopters
[46:14.600 --> 46:19.880]  lift with the bio or chem weapon a sunshine project out of texas again 12 years ago got the
[46:19.880 --> 46:25.240]  documents on the marine corps plan for the helicopter stationed around the country with
[46:25.240 --> 46:30.440]  human pilots to with knockout gas or other gases to knock out whole cities during civil
[46:30.440 --> 46:34.920]  insurrection and of course the marines wanted that reclassified you can read those articles about
[46:34.920 --> 46:44.360]  that let's type in marine corps orders a sunshine project to you know to to remove and reclassified
[46:44.360 --> 46:49.320]  documents but the point is that now they don't even need to have people get in the helicopters
[46:49.320 --> 46:55.560]  and do it the globalists just have it all set up it's all compartmentalized robot trucks deliver
[46:55.560 --> 47:01.560]  the nerve gas robots load the drones you've only got a few technicians involved at the nerve gas
[47:01.560 --> 47:06.120]  plant they don't even know where it's going or the bio weapon plant the airborne Ebola they hit the
[47:06.120 --> 47:11.640]  button the globalist Nancy Pelosi all of them on record have passes to the underground bunkers
[47:11.640 --> 47:17.320]  nuclear power plants underground reservoirs everything they emerge two years later we're all
[47:17.320 --> 47:23.960]  dead and they openly say the globalists say i mean i've given you their quotes and their plans
[47:23.960 --> 47:29.640]  that that is what their big goal is and as soon as they think they've got it ready they're going to
[47:29.640 --> 47:35.720]  do it right now they just want to get world war three going with the muslims they want to get
[47:35.720 --> 47:41.240]  control government sin with control elites there who are being promised access to the bunkers
[47:41.240 --> 47:46.520]  and access to the future to make sure it's a concerted standardized extermination of humanity
[47:49.240 --> 47:53.000]  this is why i understand i'm risking my life doing this folks but there's no future if we
[47:53.000 --> 47:57.400]  don't stop this i know i was the cook that said they'd use derivatives to bring in a worldwide
[47:57.400 --> 48:01.960]  depression but before that happened there'd be stage terror attacks probably blowing up something
[48:01.960 --> 48:06.280]  like the world trade senator layman on bin laden and that they would set up a system called homeland
[48:06.280 --> 48:11.320]  security to take over our society and pass laws to abolish positive commentators and allow the
[48:11.320 --> 48:19.400]  secret arrest of us citizens now law this is just us being chained down so the vampire can come over
[48:19.400 --> 48:26.600]  and drink our blood at its leisure you look at grandkids in the eyes folks and you know in my gut
[48:26.600 --> 48:31.080]  everybody's got gut instinct not just the data you know even though this sounds crazy you know inside
[48:31.080 --> 48:36.520]  it's true you know it's true we just by the way they just found the sunshine project documents
[48:37.720 --> 48:43.480]  go ahead and click on it because it was still saved on the way back machine i guess the marines
[48:43.480 --> 48:47.800]  got tired of bullying people as long as somebody followed their order to pull it off their website
[48:47.800 --> 48:53.560]  you can find on the way back machine in the digital archives i don't know is that the one
[48:54.280 --> 48:59.800]  at the insistence the united states marine corps uh the july 14th three items were removed from the
[48:59.800 --> 49:05.480]  sunshine project online clearinghouse yeah and that's the uh that's the knockout gas for us
[49:05.480 --> 49:12.760]  cities the military doesn't work for us you figure that out yet new rule order took over a long time
[49:12.760 --> 49:18.280]  ago and they've been but they but again they're they're in control the top and control the money
[49:18.280 --> 49:23.480]  now they're just there was still so much freedom of speech independent radio stations still a free
[49:23.480 --> 49:29.640]  web they don't have total control yet they want the total control they want the homeland security
[49:29.640 --> 49:33.320]  and i just mentioned to you that when they have their global standardization in place that's when
[49:33.320 --> 49:38.440]  they drop the hammer and they've almost got it here's a homeland security press release today
[49:39.800 --> 49:45.160]  secretary napolitano unveils national strategy for global supply chain security

[50:03.000 --> 50:08.440]  is committed to facilitating legitimate trade and travel oh they're going to facilitate legitimate
[50:08.440 --> 50:12.600]  they're going to decide while preventing terrorists from exploiting supply chains protecting
[50:12.600 --> 50:17.000]  transportation systems from attacks and disruptions and increasing their reliance on global supply
[50:17.000 --> 50:21.240]  chains that means shutting everybody down and it goes on what are they saying the documents we
[50:21.240 --> 50:28.520]  reported on two days ago that are so bomb shell shock docs total federalization of police they're

[50:33.800 --> 50:39.880]  homeland security mission mission creep dhs agency abandons fighting terrorism shift to hiring police

[54:12.840 --> 54:29.400]  by the way ladies and gentlemen i give you my absolute word from the
[54:30.600 --> 54:40.680]  depths of my soul that what i've told you here in the last 15 minutes is the absolute
[54:40.680 --> 54:51.080]  researched verified truth in not triplicate not quadruplicate but by the thousands okay i wish
[54:51.080 --> 54:59.320]  every day this wasn't true i wish every second but look at the horrors of whole pot of hitler of
[54:59.320 --> 55:05.320]  mal of stallion of the thousands of tyrants throughout history thousands of them who would
[55:05.320 --> 55:11.720]  just do horrible things and burn down whole cities and order the firstborn children killed
[55:12.360 --> 55:19.560]  so many cultures would always order the firstborn killed the egyptians the aztecs almost every culture
[55:19.560 --> 55:32.120]  the druids when psychopaths get into control and that's what i'm trying to get across to you
[55:32.120 --> 55:39.960]  imagine you're a criminal elite who 160 years ago based in the british empire says we need to learn
[55:39.960 --> 55:46.600]  how to stay in power we want to as part of the scientific revolution not just be ham fisted
[55:46.600 --> 55:52.600]  about tyranny but but but but really get it refined and the elites came back the scientific elites
[55:52.600 --> 55:57.240]  and said okay we'll start putting stuff in the water and food to make a more docile or kill them
[55:57.240 --> 56:03.320]  whatever you wish we don't just suggest that we kill the infirm well actually try to promote more
[56:03.320 --> 56:06.840]  of them but we'll tell the low-level eugenicist that we're trying to get rid of them we want to
[56:06.840 --> 56:11.720]  kill the intelligent that don't serve us that challenge us which is what a grizzly bear does
[56:11.720 --> 56:21.160]  to the male baby which is what uh lions male lions do to male babies to cubs i mean really you see
[56:21.160 --> 56:25.400]  it in the animal kingdom and then they said yes that's what we're doing survival of the fit is
[56:25.400 --> 56:32.760]  taken to the next degree social Darwinism and i mean look the guys have learned that they can
[56:32.760 --> 56:36.840]  just type in whatever i say and pull it up and this is what's scaring the system here this
[56:36.840 --> 56:43.000]  show is all about teaching you how to look up stuff i said texas sunshine project marine core documents
[56:45.080 --> 56:50.440]  censored and they pulled it up and then you can find the links where it's still archived for now
[56:50.440 --> 56:58.280]  where it talks about helicopters ready in every sector of the us to take off with knockout gas
[56:58.280 --> 57:03.960]  and they estimate it'll kill 14 of people in the cities they hit because you'll have car wrecks fires
[57:03.960 --> 57:11.960]  explosions people falling over with hardcore 100 opium gases that they and then of course they've
[57:11.960 --> 57:17.000]  got the lethal ones and the rest of it i mean you can't make it up i mean i remember when marines
[57:17.000 --> 57:22.120]  told me you ought to see the combat robots we've got but they're highly classified and then later
[57:22.120 --> 57:28.200]  i'd talk to top generals and people off record they're like how do you know about that i talked to
[57:28.200 --> 57:34.200]  the former head of star wars program and i said tell me about the unmanned robot space planes
[57:34.760 --> 57:39.880]  and the d u sebo and he's like how do you know that he goes well i can't tell you some because
[57:39.880 --> 57:45.720]  there was one leak but i could only tell you about the leak i mean folks they've got since the 70s
[57:45.720 --> 57:53.560]  orbiting black mana craft with d u decapitation weapons that are that are meant to kill leaders
[57:53.560 --> 57:59.400]  in an hour worldwide in super deep bunkers i mean the globalists have taken america's incredible
[57:59.400 --> 58:07.640]  wealth and built the empire of satan and and and the country's under strong delusion and and
[58:07.640 --> 58:13.080]  now homeland security is announcing standardization of everything homeland security is just a militarized
[58:13.080 --> 58:18.440]  force already implementing what the corporate chiefs have agreed on just like 40 years ago
[58:18.440 --> 58:24.840]  this year worldwide blood began to be taken at birth again large secret standardized
[58:24.840 --> 58:32.360]  unified continuity of agenda towards world government and when the world government is set up
[58:32.360 --> 58:44.840]  they are going to release weapons to kill at least 90 of us they've said they are this is gcn the
[58:44.840 --> 58:53.560]  genesis communications radio network did you ever think you'd be where you are a decade into the

[01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:57.800]  minute some stations don't carry this segment but and i'll fully introducing but what an amazing guy
[01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:05.400]  he's been out there for decades exposing vaccines and uh he treats a giant group of young people who
[01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:11.800]  aren't showing any signs of autism he doesn't just have the control groups of the um amish who
[01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:18.760]  who don't have autism it's unknown uh might exist like a leprechaun or something and now he has his
[01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:25.880]  own giant uh clinics and uh is very popular and can't find it so wow dr eisenstein thank you for
[01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:32.360]  coming on uh with me sir oh elix it's always a pleasure and uh i tell you one of the problems is
[01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:37.960]  the problems are so bad that you don't even sound sound that way out anymore it's a real problem i
[01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:44.040]  mean i think when i think we we have to start getting some different positions because unfortunately
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:49.640]  you're unmasking the truth that the people are listening well i mean i wish i was wrong i know the
[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:53.880]  stuff i talk about sounds crazy but isn't true stranger than fiction i mean look at all the
[01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:58.040]  other crazy stuff that's happened in history now let me tell you something you know there's a great
[01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:03.960]  legal principle uh but it's where the judge tells the jury when they're about to deliberate
[01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:09.160]  false isn't doing no false is an omnibus if you catch someone who's been a witness lying about
[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:13.640]  one thing you can make the assumption they're lying about something else and you can disregard
[01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:18.600]  everything else they say what you just pointed out just the last few minutes how they lied about
[01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:25.480]  we had dr. Rand Paul they lied about strip searching over women you know and i had an interesting
[01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:32.120]  episode in a airport a couple days ago where uh they said you have to go through the scanner i said
[01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:36.120]  no no no i'm not going through the scanner i said i'm an obstacle hold on doc i don't want you to
[01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:40.200]  be interrupted we're going to come right back with dr. mayor eisenstein i'll properly introduce him
[01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:45.480]  and then start over right there with the um you know that legal precept that if somebody's an
[01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:51.400]  omen liar don't believe them duh and the system lies even when the truth would suit them better
[01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:57.400]  an amazing uh doctor researcher treated over 75 000 children dr. mayor eisenstein he's also an
[01:04:57.400 --> 01:05:03.320]  author we'll tell you about his book this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider
[01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:08.440]  buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple
[01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:13.640]  your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:18.520]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name
[01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:23.800]  of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:29.080]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:34.200]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families
[01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:38.760]  lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:43.400]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators

[01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:03.800]  on f16s and stuff are now learning to fly the drones and of course that's all simulated by
[01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:08.600]  computers and is getting ready as the computer learns to get ready humans entirely and that's in
[01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:15.080]  the la times today what will the elite do when there's no military to say no to them to immoral
[01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:21.160]  things or where there's no footage that anybody sees of the war crimes we're going to be discussing
[01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:27.400]  that uh at the very end of the hour but again dr mayer eisenstein md jd mph is a graduate of the

[01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:17.880]  medical hazards of hrt and unlocking nature's pharmacy some of this many guest appearances
[01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:25.160]  include the oprah wimpford show and hannity and combs using the hcg protocol since 09 he has lost
[01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:29.880]  over a hundred pounds and i noticed that when we got him up on the video skype in march of 2010
[01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:35.480]  he started the metabolic syndrome and hcg weight loss clinic based in the same protocol that he
[01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:40.120]  followed the metabolic program told him for 500 patients lose more than seven tons in the first
[01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:45.480]  year we got to have him back just on that front uh alone but here's some of the articles we've
[01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:51.800]  got today we've got him on about vaccines polio vaccines now the first cause of polio paralysis
[01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:58.360]  worldwide of the vaccines giving you the polio uh baby dies after nine vaccines in one day
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:03.880]  you've seen a big company's just gotten trouble for what 15 babies dying after being given a vaccine
[01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:11.320]  all of this is going on and he he joins us because you know they lie and say there's not
[01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:15.160]  mercury in vaccines and we just got you on at the end of that first little segment you were
[01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:23.240]  bringing up as a lawyer not just a medical doctor this this legal understanding or bedrock
[01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:28.120]  that if someone's been caught lying before don't believe them again so so start back over a doctor
[01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:33.480]  great to have you here with us oh it's awesome to be with you and that's a principle when the judge
[01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:39.560]  gives the instructions to the jury he says them if any witnesses lied to you during the testimony
[01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:45.160]  it's been shown to be lied you can you can disregard you have the right to describe everything else
[01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:49.480]  and i think when you point it out over and over again you know they lied about the mercury they
[01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:54.920]  lied about the toxins they lied about the effectiveness of vaccines and you know alex i'm
[01:11:54.920 --> 01:12:02.440]  a very blessed man i tell you why um uh i was a student of the late dr robert bethelsen
[01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:10.360]  and almost 50 years ago he made a statement that no vaccine has ever been shown to eliminate any
[01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:19.640]  childhood disease you know and uh you know thursday and four is not thirty seven thirty seven forty
[01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:26.280]  say four and nine years ago and um we're having dates wrong you know so i've been very fortunate
[01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:32.040]  because that's the reason my six children and ten grandchildren have never been involved with any of
[01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:38.440]  this type of stuff and why we've been able to use dr bethelsen's principles to be able to implement
[01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:45.320]  not giving vaccines to many of our children i went to law school for a very specific reason
[01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:51.400]  to be able to help those families and there's now millions of them your work has been awesome
[01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:58.840]  millions of children of families who've decided not to vaccinate and i see one of my jobs is to
[01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:05.480]  help them in any way i can to uh to legally avoid vaccines and it's illegal hack that may be the
[01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:12.440]  right way to do it too well just to be specific here you are one of the major pioneers in exposing
[01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:17.160]  the dangers of vaccines for decades so you're saying you woke up because of the top you know
[01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:22.440]  famous doctor that you worked under uh but but now you've actually done the research explain to
[01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:27.880]  people what we see in the amish but also in the giant uh pool or i guess they call it control
[01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:33.000]  group in a study of your own patients where is the scourge of autism that's gone from
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:39.320]  one in 25 000 a few decades ago to one in 68 or so uh we're now seeing and all these neurological
[01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:44.920]  disorders and other things where is that with your patients where is that uh with the amish
[01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:49.960]  virtually doesn't exist you know and it's more than just uh autism or like i like to call it
[01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:56.680]  brain damage from vaccines because autism is a true true illness one in 10 000 one in 25 000
[01:13:56.680 --> 01:14:02.360]  but it's not the same as as what we're seeing today we're seeing children who can't talk seven
[01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:06.920]  year olds doesn't talk still makes their pants you know we we got tremendous amount of neurological
[01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:13.640]  damage you know but also we virtually see no you know add adhd we don't have i think a single case
[01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:19.320]  of peanut allergy in our practice is it all related to vaccines well i'm sure a large part of it
[01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:26.760]  you know and in spite of that see i think unfortunately the eugenics aspect is 100 right when you
[01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:32.440]  start taking a look at people like bill gates uh um and what is his job with that what does he know
[01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:37.800]  about vaccines nothing he said he knows and kills people he has outwardly said we have to get rid
[01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:43.880]  of most people in this world you know uh and you know i tell you when we have to focus on elix
[01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:49.960]  how do we help people how do we help how do we save people how do we save people from being
[01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:57.400]  exposed to having to take vaccines and it's not getting easy anymore because hospitals are firing
[01:14:57.400 --> 01:15:04.280]  nurses who refuse to get flu vaccine flu vaccine of all the stupidity that there is around you know
[01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:09.480]  uh and i if anyone is still skeptical that any of these things make any difference i want to
[01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:15.720]  show a couple of slides that i brought here the first one i want to show is uh it's got a um it's
[01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:22.760]  it's um a red slide but the fourth or fifth one where it shows the um uh the increase in mortality
[01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:29.320]  of children from flu over the last uh ten years you take a look there was almost no
[01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:35.800]  death from children until they start giving the flu vaccines to children and again we're we're
[01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:41.800]  on xM and over a hundred AM and FM stations but we're showing a graph for the uh legal record here
[01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:47.800]  on the video that hundreds of thousands will watch today millions overall and we're showing a graph
[01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:53.240]  here in fact blow that up guys for the blue part is is filling the screen thank you uh you can see
[01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:59.640]  there that as soon as they start giving the vaccine that's when that's when the the flu vaccine
[01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:04.360]  that's when suddenly the deaths from flu explode we have the canadian studies last year as you know
[01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:09.800]  doctor or two years ago that the h1 in one vaccine doubled your chances of getting the regular flu
[01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:16.040]  lowered your immunity now we also know that they never get the vaccine uh correct to actually
[01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:21.240]  match what the flu is that year it's a giant hoax but tell us more about this this graph that we
[01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:26.440]  have up on screen well this way you take a look you can see there's hardly any deaths on the
[01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:33.400]  uh left hand part in the uh uh and all of a sudden as time goes on all of a sudden they introduce
[01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:37.880]  the flu vaccine and it becomes banned and all of a sudden the death rate starts skyrocketing you
[01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:45.560]  know uh and almost all the deaths in children from the h1 n1 were children who were vaccinating
[01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:50.520]  with the h1 n1 yeah i mean it's it's just frightening you know but if you need any for adults
[01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:56.520]  and go to the next slide this one is even more frightening because it shows this is the one
[01:16:56.520 --> 01:17:02.760]  that says influenza and pneumonia mortality rates and influenza vaccine coverage and you take a look
[01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:11.880]  at the broken line is the percentage of people receiving the flu vaccine and the brown line
[01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:18.440]  is people who die from uh flu and pneumonia the reason pneumonia is because that's the that's the
[01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:24.360]  what actually kills you not the flu itself as the more people the population get the flu vaccine
[01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:27.800]  more people die from it it's incredible but let's expand we're going to show one more
[01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:32.360]  slide here in a moment but now doctor now that people are waking up and saying no
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:37.000]  california passed the law to shoot kids up without telling their parents in the classical
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:42.520]  fascism medical medical tyranny uh they're now running hoaxes everywhere it's the law to take
[01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:48.440]  vaccines i talked to one of my crew members whose wife is an rn that people got sick when they were
[01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:54.120]  forced to take it and one nurse a young nurse is in a wheelchair now and they're not supposed to
[01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:58.600]  talk about it and i talked to nurses everywhere i mean this is like something out of a science
[01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:04.200]  fiction movie that's right you could the truth you couldn't make this up i mean uh i mean here's
[01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:08.760]  where the truth is stranger the fictional more frightening and let's look at one more slide
[01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:15.160]  and that is the one on united states mortality rates and that's for measles scow fever typhoid
[01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:20.360]  whoopie coughed inferior and you see it looks like something scribbled by a kindergarten child
[01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:27.480]  but what you see is that all these diseases in the 1900s you know uh had relatively high mortality
[01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:32.360]  and the mortality rates start dropping but you take a look the vaccines are introduced and nothing
[01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:38.360]  changes because look at scow fever typhoid no vaccines given for them they disappear at the
[01:18:38.360 --> 01:18:44.680]  same rate i i asked one question of every doctor who still has any hope in vaccines that make a
[01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:51.960]  difference explain to me how tuberculosis uh disappeared explain to me how cholera typhoid
[01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:57.880]  rocky mountain spotted fever explain to me before you start talking about uh the ones that we get
[01:18:57.880 --> 01:19:03.640]  unbelievable it was sanitation wasn't it sir and better nutrition sanitation and also diseases
[01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:07.960]  just have certain periods where they're there and then they just kind of die out by themselves you
[01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:13.640]  know and all we could do and whooping cough is a great example you introduce a vaccine that only
[01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:18.760]  works on the mild strains and the other strains are dying out now we're seeing whooping cough
[01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:23.640]  epidemics but only really essentially children have been vaccinated those who have been vaccinated
[01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:28.040]  for all practicality have no problems see that's another big thing i see the numbers even in the
[01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:32.360]  mainstream news but it's buried i want to come back and talk about this the vaccines are actually
[01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:38.680]  making the children get what they're supposedly fighting it's incredible exactly you know and
[01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:43.800]  let me read you one more thing here and this was an article that was in the medical journal called

[01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:40.040]  aren't they uh doc and uh you're here giving people numbers but i live you know and sleep and
[01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:45.080]  breathe media i see all the stuff you're talking about i mean the big pharma knows the vaccines
[01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:50.040]  are reducing immunity they know they're making people get sick they know they're creating
[01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:56.280]  deadly strains just like overuse of antibiotics and their answer to our awakening is okay we're
[01:24:56.280 --> 01:25:01.640]  going to make you but please continue with that quote you were giving us uh and uh tell us again
[01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:08.120]  where that came from uh well the uh oh you're talking about the uh whatever you're this is a quote
[01:25:08.120 --> 01:25:15.320]  in the journal vaccine and says a new article in vaccine sheds light on the online practices of such
[01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:23.080]  rooms the global anti vaccination movement which is a loose coagulate coagulation of rogue scientists
[01:25:23.080 --> 01:25:28.440]  so i may fall in that category journalists there you are parents and celebrities who think that
[01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:35.000]  vaccines cause disease like autism a claim that has been thoroughly discredited by modern science
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:40.120]  now let me tell you what's interesting even about their quote um going to law school ruins you
[01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:45.400]  because you look at every word thoroughly discredited well discredited doesn't mean anything
[01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:52.280]  you know uh even their own writing doesn't make any sense it it should be thoroughly disproven
[01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:56.680]  but they don't use the word disproven because they know that's not true it's been discredited just
[01:25:56.680 --> 01:26:02.360]  like the earth was flat was discredited uh people were hung because of those beliefs you know uh
[01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:11.160]  but i one more important thing that because i um a lot of people listening uh alex a lot of parents
[01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:17.720]  grandparents don't want to vaccinate and many of them have school-aged children or high school
[01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:24.520]  students or college students and they've always asked me what is the best way for me to avoid vaccines
[01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:31.800]  and i put up a map here and this map of the united states uh there's 18 states left they're green
[01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:37.000]  in texas you're in a green state there has nothing to do with the nonsense of green our jobs you know
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:43.000]  um it has to do with they allow a philosophical exemption for vaccines and if you take a look
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:49.480]  every state except mississippi and west virginia allow for a religious exemption so those two states
[01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:55.320]  you can't live in i recommend and it's in my book don't vaccinate before you educate and i also
[01:26:55.320 --> 01:27:01.480]  want to have a webinar this a sunday evening and just go to my home my webpage homefirst.com click on
[01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:06.520]  the webinar link and just sign up but it's complimentary so just put your email address in
[01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:13.960]  and i recommend if you don't want to vaccinate your children don't give a philosophical exemption
[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:19.960]  what does that mean a philosophical exemption is i you don't have to give i it's i don't believe in
[01:27:19.960 --> 01:27:24.920]  vaccines i don't want to do that 18 states that include texas allows that because if you move from
[01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:31.960]  texas to let's say montana or wyoming or illinois they don't allow for that exception and if the
[01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:37.800]  state legislature could overturn it but it's still pretty hard to overturn the constitution although
[01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:42.360]  i thought our president's trying very hard you know uh yeah let's be clear they've introduced this
[01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:48.520]  exemption stuff because they know their so-called law is just really a regulation to attend school
[01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:55.160]  and they kind of trick people into the exemption process itself uh i know that i haven't even
[01:27:55.160 --> 01:28:01.000]  done the exemption process they can just go jump in the lake fly a kite and go to a very warm place
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:08.040]  exactly but but but but but if you have to hand in anything only hand in a religious exception
[01:28:08.040 --> 01:28:13.560]  that still has protection from the first amendment you know don't ever hand in a personal belief
[01:28:13.560 --> 01:28:18.040]  exception you know and i'd be happy to help anyone who needs some help with that you know right
[01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:22.680]  that's much stronger first amendment but what if the tyrants do nationwide what they do in
[01:28:22.680 --> 01:28:29.000]  the bellwether california doctor and lawyer uh eisenstein what do we do counselor as they export
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:34.680]  this everywhere and a child can't buy alcohol can't have sex even if they want to when they're 12
[01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:39.160]  because it's not it's they're on an adult it's statutory rape it's contributing to the legacy
[01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:43.960]  of a minor how does california say then we're going to brainwash your kid we're going to shoot
[01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:49.000]  him up when they're 12 and not even tell you i mean that is outrageous it's absolutely outrageous
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:52.920]  you know uh and the bottom line is you just have to say no you may have to keep your children out
[01:28:52.920 --> 01:28:56.600]  of school you may have to hold school your children which many of my patients do you know
[01:28:57.320 --> 01:29:02.360]  you may have to send it to a religious school a small religious school which will help you
[01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:07.160]  avoid vaccines uh look let me tell you something it's not it's getting harder and harder you know
[01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:11.880]  but you have to stop going to doctors they're going to chiropractors homeopaths
[01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:18.600]  uh um nephropaths doctors look at very strong history of being not only against vaccines but
[01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:23.400]  look you take a strong book at the dangers of all the pharmaceuticals doc we got a long segment
[01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:26.920]  coming up you'll have i got a lot of questions for you at any point you want to make you really
[01:29:26.920 --> 01:29:32.760]  are one of the most informed people on this subject but i mean this is getting to an insane point here
[01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:38.920]  where they're coming for our kids we're awake we know what they're doing they're crooks
[01:29:38.920 --> 01:29:45.480]  they're hurting people they're eugenicists like bayer with the facturated hiv knowingly
[01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:51.480]  for 10 years shipping it out and then these murderers are coming for us we're on the march
[01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:56.840]  the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:30:00.760 --> 01:30:05.880]  hi this is alex jones did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret
[01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:10.360]  storage vaults near the arctic circle did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds
[01:30:10.360 --> 01:30:14.600]  could become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds have all performed even gold and
[01:30:14.600 --> 01:30:19.160]  silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again so our friends at
[01:30:19.160 --> 01:30:24.360]  solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a

[01:33:12.360 --> 01:33:16.680]  all right well we've definitely got to have him back up just on all of his other knowledge in the
[01:33:16.680 --> 01:33:26.360]  near future because i could talk to dr eisenstein for hours but when i start thinking about how
[01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:40.680]  incredibly creepy it is that big pharma can come just lobby and then get government to run a hoax
[01:33:40.680 --> 01:33:47.080]  and say a vaccine is mandated or mandatory and then now they've got people going door to door
[01:33:47.080 --> 01:33:53.240]  under a department of health program knocking on doors i played this clip a bunch and saying
[01:33:53.240 --> 01:33:57.880]  we're coming in to give your child a shot and trying to intimidate their way in through color of law
[01:33:59.160 --> 01:34:06.520]  i mean this is hardcore corruption and in the soviet russia in nazi germany in so many other
[01:34:06.520 --> 01:34:11.640]  countries tyranny first comes in a form of medicalized tyranny through psychiatry and other
[01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:16.920]  systems but i think about the un our own government black men with syphilis giving them syphilis
[01:34:16.920 --> 01:34:22.200]  to skee now we learned they were shooting kids up in latin america we learned about the un doing
[01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:27.480]  stuff like this currently at exteriors to vaccines it is a eugenics program you've got bill gates
[01:34:27.480 --> 01:34:32.440]  talking about too many people and if we can vaccinate we'll lower the population that's a quote
[01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:38.600]  and everybody laughing in the audience of these academics uh this is really going on and they
[01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:43.720]  want the precedent to put in our body what they want when they want when the guard is still
[01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:48.840]  was killing people during the trials and so they had rick perry come out and mandate it so that it
[01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:54.680]  would get government liability protection once it was quote mandated by a chief executive like a
[01:34:54.680 --> 01:35:01.000]  governor i mean these are cold-blooded companies uh and uh you were continuing there and we hit
[01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:05.720]  that last uh break getting into a piece of news sir go ahead but yeah i can tell you what's even
[01:35:05.720 --> 01:35:10.120]  more important is that's listening to what you're saying yalex uh you've had a tremendous impact
[01:35:10.120 --> 01:35:18.200]  look what happened in 2009 in spite of millions and millions of dollars of advertising how dangerous
[01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:23.880]  the swan flu is going to be the majority of americans rejected even though it's being free
[01:35:23.880 --> 01:35:30.040]  how much more can you save the debt and what other statistic that came out in 2010 the death rate
[01:35:30.040 --> 01:35:38.920]  from flu in 2009 2010 year was lower than any time in the last 10 years the only thing uniquely
[01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:44.600]  different was no one had a flu vaccine that year at least 75 or 80 percent of the country didn't
[01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:49.480]  how incredible is that so obviously the message is getting out and that's what's exciting because
[01:35:49.480 --> 01:35:56.040]  i still have great great faith in this country you know um and my dad always said my dad was from
[01:35:56.040 --> 01:36:03.720]  russia uh he escaped hitler by going to china i was actually born today 66 years ago in china
[01:36:03.720 --> 01:36:09.720]  oh happy birthday thank you you bet my mom there and he always used to say uh the greatest thing
[01:36:09.720 --> 01:36:15.560]  about america is no matter how bad things are i pray that it continues like that we eventually
[01:36:16.520 --> 01:36:21.800]  get rid of some of politicians other ones come in they're all the same but the bottom line is
[01:36:21.800 --> 01:36:27.320]  that we can live here and boy i don't know what my dad would say today because it's getting more
[01:36:27.320 --> 01:36:31.080]  frightening more frightening well that's what i was about to say before we always had corrupt
[01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:38.280]  politicians we always had uh uh you know bad politicians it was a mix but now with this whole
[01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:44.920]  homeland system and this corporate bureaucracy it's evil yeah where they actually run everything
[01:36:44.920 --> 01:36:50.600]  and then the and then the politicians are just window dressing it's creepy it's very creepy i mean
[01:36:50.600 --> 01:36:57.480]  uh we uh it used to be this expression is what you can explain to incompetence you don't explain
[01:36:57.480 --> 01:37:03.240]  explained by malice but unfortunately you know malice is the bigger word and i wonder what the
[01:37:03.240 --> 01:37:07.560]  president meant although i don't think he means too much i mean this is not a very smart man you
[01:37:07.560 --> 01:37:13.560]  know uh i i wish i would stop saying how smart he is because you know uh uh he does have an agenda
[01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:20.440]  you know uh but but here's the statement i will not back down from protecting our kids from mercury
[01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:26.760]  pollution uh is he talking about the light bulbs that he just mandated that that if they break he's
[01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:31.880]  been going to house and grab the kids before the uh the mercury escapes from those uh twisty uh light
[01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:36.760]  bulbs i don't know just you know very frankly it says you got to call a top level hazmat team
[01:37:36.760 --> 01:37:40.520]  of one of those little things breaks or is he talking about the vaccines they're injecting
[01:37:40.520 --> 01:37:46.040]  everybody with what do you think ten years ago of the hoax where parents would call and i saw it
[01:37:46.040 --> 01:37:53.160]  on the news saying it's a hoax conspiracy theorist say there's mercury there's never been mercury
[01:37:53.160 --> 01:37:59.320]  or they had another lie we've taken it out or or mercury's not bad for you have you seen that
[01:37:59.320 --> 01:38:04.600]  newscast where they actually say mercury's good for children's brains absolutely and let me tell
[01:38:04.600 --> 01:38:10.600]  you what's so frightening uh in 2009 i would tell other people from an organization called uh
[01:38:12.040 --> 01:38:19.160]  mercury free uh i can't remember the exact name we went to Atlanta and we put on hazmat suits
[01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:25.000]  you know i usually have been there you're a love it and uh we were going to take a pretend vial of
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:34.360]  the uh h1n1 flu vaccine and throw it on the the street then have our hazmat team uh sweep it up
[01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:40.360]  we were told we'd be arrested and put in jail because even because because the vaccine once
[01:38:40.360 --> 01:38:45.720]  it spilled becomes a federal offense you know i'm sitting there saying you got me kidding
[01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:50.200]  they said it was safe for me and so we weren't able to do it but we still had our hazmat team
[01:38:50.200 --> 01:38:54.040]  they're uh how frightening how absolutely frightening is this let me tell you something
[01:38:54.040 --> 01:39:00.520]  about mercury um there we have an uh an epidemic of obesity in this country there's no question
[01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:04.920]  about it i i unfortunately was a good part of that and i think we have some of the solutions but
[01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:10.360]  the question is what caused it you know look at everyone's gotten heavier especially our children
[01:39:10.360 --> 01:39:17.320]  are so much heavier one of the causes may be mercury even in the smallest amount mercury
[01:39:17.320 --> 01:39:22.600]  disrupts your system and doesn't allow you and cause you to get away even i'm going to talk about
[01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:31.080]  one of the smallest effects if you take one drop of mercury and throw it into a 10 000 gallon pool
[01:39:31.080 --> 01:39:36.840]  the whole pool is contaminated one drop well i mean as you know doc this is one of the metals
[01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:41.240]  heavy metals they've actually studied for hundreds and hundreds of years because of all the industrial
[01:39:41.240 --> 01:39:45.640]  disasters in england the you know the the term mad as a hatter because it was involved in the
[01:39:45.640 --> 01:39:50.840]  clothiers and in the stains that it made people go crazy it's connected to schizophrenia but they
[01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:54.840]  never want to say that because they just want to you know basically try to treat it with drugs
[01:39:54.840 --> 01:39:58.920]  instead of a heavy metal toxicity of course some of it's genetic as well but the point is
[01:39:58.920 --> 01:40:04.600]  is there's different types they know all of this and i've seen the university of calgary electron
[01:40:04.600 --> 01:40:11.000]  microscope stuff where they put other heavy metals close to uh mammal brains and they only
[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:17.080]  cause some electrochemical damage but mercury in the brain causes a chain reaction and just keeps
[01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:22.200]  eating through the brain frightening and let me tell you but i want to expand for one minute
[01:40:22.200 --> 01:40:26.360]  if someone shouldn't believe it's only mercury because some of the vaccines don't have mercury
[01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:32.120]  many of the vaccines have ethylene glycol antifreeze phenol uh and known carcinogenic
[01:40:32.120 --> 01:40:39.960]  formaldehyde aluminum neomycin streptomycin fetal parts you know it's don't get too hung up on
[01:40:39.960 --> 01:40:45.800]  mercury because they'll say oh we'll take it out and you still have all the other toxins and even more
[01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:51.640]  aluminum maybe as toxic as mercury and if you take the mercury out in order to keep the vaccine
[01:40:51.640 --> 01:40:56.040]  stable they have to put aluminum in just absolutely right well that's like dr blalock says it's an
[01:40:56.040 --> 01:41:02.840]  incredible adjuvant and super charges everything uh and intensifies it that's what he says his
[01:41:02.840 --> 01:41:09.640]  research shows it does and then dr billock if anyone does know is a neurosurgeon one of the most
[01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:13.640]  most brilliant people i've ever met in my life you know as far as that goes i'm going to be talking
[01:41:13.640 --> 01:41:18.520]  about this alex the sunday night it's a complimentary webinar you can go on our website
[01:41:18.520 --> 01:41:23.800]  homefirst.com hit webinars and sign up for it it'll be archived i'll show about 200 slides
[01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:30.840]  this and also i will answer questions about uh how to legally avoid vaccines to the best of
[01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:36.600]  our ability the best ways to listen to alex because oh no no no this is invaluable saving lives here
[01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:41.720]  dr isaac and you know i'd like to welcome you back in a month or so as it's been too long and
[01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:46.520]  perhaps we could do a shorter webinar and i could actually sit here and shut up some and
[01:41:46.520 --> 01:41:52.120]  uh have you go over some of those slides uh and points here on the radio with us as well
[01:41:52.680 --> 01:41:57.640]  the fc attitude be my pleasure my honor well folks need to go to homefirst.com
[01:41:57.640 --> 01:42:02.760]  and find out about that webinar the books all the material uh you've done an incredible job
[01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:07.160]  and again we're starting to turn the tide people are waking up in fact i've seen studies doc can
[01:42:07.160 --> 01:42:12.920]  you speak to this briefly where they were bemoaning in northern california that in the per capita
[01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:18.200]  highest educated county in the state they have the lowest uh vaccination level something only
[01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:24.040]  like 35 percent were vaccinating their children and that all over the country the more highly educated
[01:42:24.040 --> 01:42:29.000]  the more people aren't vaccinating now what does that tell the establishment that the facts
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:33.800]  are there the worm is turned and now they're going to try to force us to take vaccines
[01:42:33.800 --> 01:42:39.400]  when their own vaccines as you pointed out are causing the whooping cop uh epidemic and people
[01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:44.440]  like daughter dina del i've heard him say arrest people that don't vaccinate they're endangering
[01:42:44.440 --> 01:42:49.800]  the rest of us well wait a minute if you've had the shot dean and you take every new dangerous
[01:42:49.800 --> 01:42:55.160]  experimental shot that comes out you should be protected then why can't i make them right exactly
[01:42:55.160 --> 01:43:01.240]  exactly why you're worried but you know why it's only in the the so-called quote rich you know uh
[01:43:01.240 --> 01:43:06.040]  it's because the poor people aren't allowed to get their food stamps they have their medicaid
[01:43:06.040 --> 01:43:11.400]  benefits unless they vaccinate they tie it together and so i've talked to many many poor people
[01:43:11.400 --> 01:43:16.840]  they say god if we could avoid it we would avoid it also yeah so it's like a firing squad i mean
[01:43:16.840 --> 01:43:22.120]  that is eugenics get them under your control and then medicalize them with this and you know when
[01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:26.840]  this all completely comes out and it is coming out but i mean look at rick perry destroyed by the
[01:43:26.840 --> 01:43:32.280]  garter cell situation i told him at the time it was going to destroy him yeah well rick unfortunately
[01:43:32.280 --> 01:43:37.560]  rick perry just didn't understand the issue or or or he was too tiny with murk i'm not sure which
[01:43:37.560 --> 01:43:41.880]  one you know well he bought off i mean they bought all bought off almost the entire legislature but
[01:43:41.880 --> 01:43:48.840]  but i mean my point to you is um and i want your take on this in closing dr eisenstein imagine as
[01:43:48.840 --> 01:43:53.640]  all of this more and more of this comes out all the people that have fought for vaccines all the
[01:43:53.640 --> 01:43:58.600]  doctors that have endorsed it and written articles in the newspapers and the criminals that knew at
[01:43:58.600 --> 01:44:05.000]  the top what this was really doing they need to be brought to justice because this is very similar
[01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:10.360]  to the medical tyranny we saw in nazi germany and and i it's not enough to just defeat these people
[01:44:10.360 --> 01:44:16.120]  i when it all comes down i want to see him go to prison i i absolutely agree with you because you
[01:44:16.120 --> 01:44:23.880]  know uh there's no excuse the legal principles new or should have known that's the standard that doctors
[01:44:23.880 --> 01:44:30.040]  held to when it comes to um male practice and criminal the same thing new or should have known
[01:44:30.040 --> 01:44:36.280]  you know it's it's it's embarrassing that the smartest people in our society doctors will um
[01:44:37.160 --> 01:44:41.080]  you know and i'm not patting myself in the back as much we're the most red you know
[01:44:41.080 --> 01:44:45.800]  do not spend the time to sit and study and do the research there's so much evidence there
[01:44:45.800 --> 01:44:49.960]  you know just look at some of the graphs and what else to explain that you know unbelievable
[01:44:49.960 --> 01:44:53.640]  i agree with you they have to come to justice all right well let's do this let's get you on in the
[01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:58.760]  next month or so to do in a full hour or more with the slides and a big presentation similar
[01:44:58.760 --> 01:45:03.400]  what you're going to do uh coming up this weekend god bless you doc thanks for spending time thank
[01:45:03.400 --> 01:45:08.440]  you my pleasure be well all right be well you're so a great guy and hopefully we'll save some lives
[01:45:08.440 --> 01:45:15.400]  again with this today uh in closing since i brought it up here is the video clip from cbs news
[01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:20.600]  locally in austin but they aired similar stuff all over the country saying mercury is good for
[01:45:20.600 --> 01:45:31.480]  your child's brain here it is device wins over the counter approval by the FDA and sick of your
[01:45:31.480 --> 01:45:36.920]  glasses and contact lenses a new corrective eye surgery is approved today here's tonight's medical
[01:45:36.920 --> 01:45:44.280]  headlines with medical watch reporters see the matter mercury containing vaccines may help not
[01:45:44.280 --> 01:45:49.880]  harm kids according to two new studies in the journal pediatrics there have been lots by concerns
[01:45:49.880 --> 01:45:54.200]  that mercury based preservatives and vaccines might impair the neurological development of
[01:45:54.200 --> 01:45:59.560]  children these new studies suggest that the offices that the preservatives may actually be associated
[01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:06.200]  with improved behavior and mental performance okay and that was a cbs video package produced in
[01:46:06.200 --> 01:46:10.680]  new york and then they just read off a teleprompter locally because they found you'll you'll trust
[01:46:10.680 --> 01:46:15.560]  local faces more than national but they're only speaking and regurgitating the demonic
[01:46:15.560 --> 01:46:22.760]  evil uh and i have clips we don't have time you can type it into youtube uh msnbc no cnbc says
[01:46:22.760 --> 01:46:27.880]  led good for children and they actually say led is good for children don't worry about the chinese
[01:46:27.880 --> 01:46:34.120]  toys uh melamine was killing kids they said don't worry it's good for them your kid dies so what
[01:46:34.120 --> 01:46:39.560]  are they got to hook them up on dialysis more cash for them again instead of denying things now
[01:46:39.560 --> 01:46:46.840]  they just throw it in your face with pure evil i mean it is mind-blowing i want to bring ted
[01:46:46.840 --> 01:46:51.480]  anderson up here briefly on the economy because he was raising this point ted i know you've got
[01:46:51.480 --> 01:46:55.640]  some of the articles two weeks ago i saw the wall street journal and washington post report
[01:46:55.640 --> 01:47:03.400]  oh there will be new easing but it but it'll be other monetary easing and now he's announcing
[01:47:03.400 --> 01:47:09.880]  bernacky the federal reserve dictator until 2014 another two years at least or as three years uh
[01:47:09.880 --> 01:47:15.960]  if it's all 2014 that there'll be no interest rates increase which again gives the bankers free
[01:47:15.960 --> 01:47:21.080]  money but not the general public who they loan shark that's causing gold to go up the dollar to go
[01:47:21.080 --> 01:47:26.840]  down so they've tried to hammer gold down ahead of this but we were correct qe3 is back and most
[01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:32.760]  economists are saying this will double the rate of inflation in 2012 ted yeah well i mean forbes were
[01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:38.840]  was reporting it all the way back on november 22nd but now we have the wall street journal coming
[01:47:38.840 --> 01:47:44.280]  out with it uh there's a lot of uh publications that are talking about qe3 i don't think the fed
[01:47:44.280 --> 01:47:50.520]  is going to call it qe3 because they take they took such a heat from quantitative easing number two
[01:47:50.520 --> 01:47:54.120]  but they're doing it right now if the fed came in they stepped in they said they're going to keep
[01:47:54.120 --> 01:48:01.240]  interest rates low until the year 2014 ben bernacky is talking about having greater uh um
[01:48:01.960 --> 01:48:09.160]  transparency to what he's doing i can tell you right now anytime you see the united states congress
[01:48:09.160 --> 01:48:15.000]  voting on a on an increase on the debt ceiling you should be owning more gold and silver because
[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:19.400]  you can expect the fact that there's going to be an increase in gold and silver prices which will
[01:48:19.400 --> 01:48:25.320]  reflect the falling of the dollar but yeah right now we're talking about qe3 wall street calls it
[01:48:25.320 --> 01:48:31.240]  that the wall street journal calls a qe3 but ben bernacky's not willing to say those words i'm sure
[01:48:31.240 --> 01:48:35.880]  he's doing that just because of the fact that he's trying to keep it uh he's trying to get the nation
[01:48:35.880 --> 01:48:43.400]  to take a look a little different look at that so well ted now is the time for people to get involved
[01:48:43.400 --> 01:48:48.120]  in gold and silver i mean every time gold and silver goes down they manipulate it down every
[01:48:48.120 --> 01:48:53.160]  time it only goes back up in the last 12 years and i think people should get into gold and silver
[01:48:53.160 --> 01:48:57.480]  and i know that you've used these the downtime to buy a bunch of gold and silver but you're not
[01:48:57.480 --> 01:49:01.480]  raising the price now that it's run up i don't know 50 something bucks the last few days you're
[01:49:01.480 --> 01:49:06.040]  actually selling it at the old lower price what are some of the specials that might as resources
[01:49:06.040 --> 01:49:10.760]  has well i one of the specials i mean but we have a bunch of specials that we just put out there
[01:49:10.760 --> 01:49:15.240]  yesterday and we haven't raised the prices from yesterday the frank is still at 371 even though
[01:49:15.240 --> 01:49:22.040]  gold today is up another 13 dollars and 40 cents we've seen a high today of 1732 currently trading
[01:49:22.040 --> 01:49:28.200]  at 1725 but these silver dollars that i have in this bag alex so these are the silver dollars that
[01:49:28.200 --> 01:49:34.440]  i put with this video and and this uh american dream video is so important to have i mean
[01:49:34.440 --> 01:49:39.000]  there's a lot of people out there that don't understand well what does qe3 mean even well
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:43.320]  you have to understand the banking system to do this i've been selling the creature from jackal
[01:49:43.320 --> 01:49:48.440]  island forever with silver dollars and getting people involved with understanding the banking

[01:53:58.120 --> 01:54:22.360]  tied together you know i noticed that welden henson is not outside the broadcast but i thought
[01:54:22.360 --> 01:54:26.600]  to go get him during the one-minute break because he's like you're absolutely right they're going
[01:54:26.600 --> 01:54:31.000]  to nothing but drones in the air force you know all my buddies that are still in the air force
[01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:36.040]  are all being taught to fly and pilot drones and when you talk about how half the air force is now
[01:54:36.040 --> 01:54:42.200]  drones it's going to be total drones well yeah the pentagon said like back in 2000 that by 2012
[01:54:42.200 --> 01:54:48.360]  half the force would be drone and that by 2020 90 plus percent except for troop carriers but what
[01:54:48.360 --> 01:54:53.880]  they're not advertising is that most the ground forces are going to be robots and i'm talking about
[01:54:53.880 --> 01:54:59.080]  little spider robots that that are a hang grenade that walk up to the enemy and kill them but the
[01:54:59.080 --> 01:55:06.600]  thing is they're autonomous here's the la times new drone has no pilot anywhere so who's accountable
[01:55:06.600 --> 01:55:12.440]  wow i'm glad that's being raised because the plan by the globalist is to have their own military
[01:55:12.440 --> 01:55:18.120]  their own system that's automated that that humans aren't involved in and that humans
[01:55:18.840 --> 01:55:22.120]  basically you know can't say well i'm not going to kill women and children or i'm not going to
[01:55:22.120 --> 01:55:25.960]  commit a mealy massacre i'm not going to do that this and that so i'm going to get welled in a
[01:55:25.960 --> 01:55:30.840]  pop in here at the first five minutes then we've got expert constitutional lawyer joining us on
[01:55:30.840 --> 01:55:36.280]  the whole police state and the web power grab and all the rest of stuff that is going on that's so
[01:55:36.280 --> 01:55:42.600]  important but briefly ted yeah i always forget that special where you've got the two silver dollars
[01:55:42.600 --> 01:55:48.680]  for 69 if folks call 73 on the web because i guess there's web fees and stuff we have those banners
[01:55:48.680 --> 01:55:52.680]  at info wars dot com the right hand side of folks want to link through and find that the american
[01:55:52.680 --> 01:55:58.680]  dream dvd film that's animated and very entertaining about the the the Rothschild banking cartel the
[01:55:58.680 --> 01:56:04.680]  Rockefellers and the rest of them and then you get mark dice's excellent book free with the shipping
[01:56:04.680 --> 01:56:10.680]  and you get silver dollars at a price that's excellent so it is a lost leader i know you lose
[01:56:10.680 --> 01:56:14.520]  money on big time on that but you're trying to get folks introduced to silver and gold but
[01:56:14.520 --> 01:56:19.400]  what about folks that are ready to start getting some real silver and gold who aren't just wanting
[01:56:19.400 --> 01:56:24.760]  some free books i mean obviously you don't we're talking about that i've got a discount right now
[01:56:24.760 --> 01:56:29.800]  there's 69 dollars if you go to the internet it's you're going to pay a little bit more but uh yeah
[01:56:29.800 --> 01:56:33.880]  if you're looking at getting into the gold and silver market right now i highly suggest that
[01:56:33.880 --> 01:56:38.840]  you get into the united states eagles uh the older double eagles you can get into the walking
[01:56:38.840 --> 01:56:43.720]  liberty haves the frank corn we buy a full year subscription to bob's newsletter the international
[01:56:43.720 --> 01:56:48.680]  forecaster there's just a lot of things that you can do when you see the debt ceiling continue to
[01:56:48.680 --> 01:56:55.720]  go up and up and up your portfolio should have more and more gold in tandem with that because
[01:56:55.720 --> 01:57:00.760]  that's the only way the fed can get more money out into the system it's how inflation comes into
[01:57:00.760 --> 01:57:06.280]  existence it's a matter of getting that debt ceiling up and then let velocity take it from there
[01:57:06.280 --> 01:57:11.080]  that's how economics work the united the federal reserve system gets the money into the system
[01:57:11.080 --> 01:57:15.800]  through the banking uh you know issuance of credit and if you don't understand that that's
[01:57:15.800 --> 01:57:20.280]  why i think it's so important to get this video the the american dream we can't even have money
[01:57:20.280 --> 01:57:24.920]  without debt and when you see the debt go up you're going to see the value the dollar go down
[01:57:24.920 --> 01:57:30.520]  it's going to eat at your substance it it destroys this nation there's no question about it you need
[01:57:30.520 --> 01:57:35.960]  to have gold and silver to protect yourself from that thing well ted it's time for folks to give
[01:57:35.960 --> 01:57:42.760]  minus resources a call 800 686 2237 i know i've bought silver and gold over the years and never

[02:00:24.600 --> 02:00:30.520]  all right we have a constitutional law expert francis boil joining us to break down india
[02:00:31.560 --> 02:00:36.920]  what are you doing you have open criminality in government the internet power grabs all that
[02:00:36.920 --> 02:00:41.800]  coming up but but right now i wanted to just briefly get welled and incident here worked here
[02:00:41.800 --> 02:00:47.800]  about four or five years great guy who's in the air force before that working on f16 another aircraft
[02:00:48.600 --> 02:00:54.680]  because he we're always talking about this but here's the los angeles times new drone has no
[02:00:54.680 --> 02:01:03.800]  pilot anywhere so who's accountable and you can go to their website actually see what the drone
[02:01:03.800 --> 02:01:09.400]  looks like looks like something out of a buck rogers movie and the pentagon has announced
[02:01:09.400 --> 02:01:14.200]  that these are going to land on carriers you name it and by 2020 they're not going to have any human
[02:01:14.200 --> 02:01:18.840]  control so that's just the intermediate it won't just be that humans aren't going to be in any of
[02:01:18.840 --> 02:01:23.480]  the aircrafts anymore it's that it's all going to be drone and it's going to be globalist programmed
[02:01:24.680 --> 02:01:30.440]  okay and then they're also by uh 2021 to have about half the ground force robot now that's really
[02:01:30.440 --> 02:01:35.080]  politically incorrect because you know john wane fights them but but let me tell you that's where
[02:01:35.080 --> 02:01:38.040]  it's going and the thing is that's why they're getting rid of the law to use the military
[02:01:38.040 --> 02:01:43.400]  against us the pentagon's publicly drawn up plans to have police robots everything and i mean this
[02:01:43.400 --> 02:01:48.920]  is what the technocracy is all about the globalists call themselves technocrats it's a global corporate
[02:01:48.920 --> 02:01:55.000]  fraud dictatorship of ponzi operators that have taken the globe over through fraud control our
[02:01:55.000 --> 02:02:01.080]  government's tax money and are militarizing against us and they're worried that military won't do what
[02:02:01.080 --> 02:02:07.880]  they say they know dunder chelchescu hitler other cases of military tried or succeeded so the military
[02:02:07.880 --> 02:02:12.680]  is to be phased out robots are to work on the robots that work on the robots and they will do it
[02:02:12.680 --> 02:02:17.160]  unless you're aware of this and stop them the pentagon is all about it and loves this level
[02:02:17.160 --> 02:02:23.560]  of evil at the top it is just it's just dedicated to to pure satanism at the top and has a lot of
[02:02:23.560 --> 02:02:27.160]  good people working for it at the bottom but well then what do you make of this we've talked a lot
[02:02:27.160 --> 02:02:32.200]  about it and here it is i could i could definitely see that uh coming into uh petition or whatever
[02:02:32.200 --> 02:02:39.000]  it's uh you know back when i was in i was i did six years from about 2006 and there was a bunch of
[02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:45.560]  talk about unmanned drones and there was a little bit of talk of this kind of stuff where there's no
[02:02:45.560 --> 02:02:51.960]  pilot anywhere but i do know even back when i was in there was a huge influx of of switching people
[02:02:51.960 --> 02:02:57.400]  with their career fields you know from just straight maintenance to uh flying drones there
[02:02:57.400 --> 02:03:02.520]  there's just a huge influx in that right now i've got several friends that are still in that you
[02:03:02.520 --> 02:03:09.400]  know just cross-trained from working on the planes to flying unmanned drones there's just a huge
[02:03:09.400 --> 02:03:13.800]  influx in that career field right now and and i didn't really think much about it until you know
[02:03:13.800 --> 02:03:17.800]  we talk about this this comes up every now and then and so that's why i just you know kind of
[02:03:17.800 --> 02:03:21.480]  reminded you about that you know earlier today when you were talking about i was like yeah that
[02:03:21.480 --> 02:03:26.520]  that that's absolutely true it's actually pretty astounding the numbers that are going over to that
[02:03:26.520 --> 02:03:31.720]  that type of program and soon it's going to be complete drones but do you see my concern and the
[02:03:31.720 --> 02:03:36.200]  globalists actually say this that they're going to use this domestically they're already using drones
[02:03:36.200 --> 02:03:42.520]  against us citizens and that soon the elites won't even need the general military they're
[02:03:42.520 --> 02:03:47.080]  going to have robots working on the robots well then i mean it's so creepy oh i believe that and
[02:03:47.080 --> 02:03:53.000]  and uh you know i even to go this far where there's no pilots i remember hearing talk about that
[02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:57.560]  and i know just doing the unmanned drone thing now is kind of just an intermediate thing to
[02:03:57.560 --> 02:04:02.280]  another step to get to that to that level was anybody concerned in the air force about this
[02:04:02.280 --> 02:04:06.840]  to anybody see where it was going not really most people are just kind of excited that there's not
[02:04:06.840 --> 02:04:11.240]  going to be any humans having to do it i guess but i was reading that the guys that fly the
[02:04:11.240 --> 02:04:15.320]  drones even get medals like when they blow a village up now yeah they're really big men but
[02:04:15.320 --> 02:04:19.480]  now it'll just be a robot completely well the scary thing about is alexis you really you lose
[02:04:19.480 --> 02:04:24.280]  your sight for humanity type you know deal where you you got someone that's not really flying the
[02:04:24.280 --> 02:04:31.000]  plane per se they're not really in danger you lose a little sense of humanity you know in that kind
[02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:37.800]  of uh i don't know aspect total dehumanization yeah absolutely but now for quote cattle thieves
[02:04:37.800 --> 02:04:43.160]  they're using predator drones i could see that yeah i mean that there's there's a lot of options
[02:04:43.160 --> 02:04:47.560]  right now if you know that type of stuff and they shake down little businesses and take
[02:04:47.560 --> 02:04:52.600]  them for the irs so they can have drones attack the people that paid for the drone and we put
[02:04:52.600 --> 02:04:57.240]  up with it folks well they're not just for for bombing or whatever it's for surveillance yeah
[02:04:57.240 --> 02:05:02.280]  absolutely there's just a whole bunch of that going on thanks well this is alex jones of five

[02:08:54.440 --> 02:09:00.520]  people that fail to stop linden and stalin and people like hitler or mouse a ton there is no
[02:09:00.520 --> 02:09:05.720]  doubt by any yardstick no matter how many constitutional law scholars i have on or historians
[02:09:06.280 --> 02:09:10.840]  i can't tell you how many people like we've heard them that i've had on the last guest dr
[02:09:10.840 --> 02:09:16.680]  eisenstein said well you used to seem far out but it's all true you're pretty much passe now
[02:09:16.680 --> 02:09:24.920]  yeah i'm passe because i got woken up by emergency managers in texas when the military approached
[02:09:24.920 --> 02:09:30.280]  them as part of a secret program to prepare for martial law and political dissidents to be rounded
[02:09:30.280 --> 02:09:35.960]  up i didn't even know what rex 84 was in the mid 90s and i went to some urban warfare drills
[02:09:35.960 --> 02:09:40.200]  and witnessed the military training to go door to door in america and pick up citizens
[02:09:40.840 --> 02:09:45.960]  i read the heart rubin commission plan to set up a tsa checkpoint system to then expand it from
[02:09:45.960 --> 02:09:51.960]  airports to highways shopping malls you name it it's now happening now homeland securities at
[02:09:51.960 --> 02:09:58.280]  davos setting up a global standardized network of control exporting this global corporate tyranny
[02:09:58.280 --> 02:10:05.640]  that's gestated here in america it's not of america i use the 1979 alien analogy it's been
[02:10:06.200 --> 02:10:12.600]  implanted in us it's gotten sustenance from us our blood supply feeds it we get the blame for it
[02:10:12.600 --> 02:10:18.120]  but it's busting out now and it's not a foot long it's about eight feet tall and it's very nasty
[02:10:18.680 --> 02:10:26.360]  and it's it's it's making its move but there's always a silver lining it's now revealing itself
[02:10:27.160 --> 02:10:32.600]  they're saying yeah senator graham says we'll secretly arrest citizens we'll kill you and
[02:10:32.600 --> 02:10:38.440]  the other senator who was one of the co-authors uh leverman says i want you to be scared and he's
[02:10:38.440 --> 02:10:43.400]  up there sweating it looks like like a bad guy out of a horror movie i want you to be scared
[02:10:43.400 --> 02:10:50.120]  and he has these one-way shark eyes i mean we are living history but it's not even a president
[02:10:51.160 --> 02:10:56.200]  they're just puppets it's it's it's a structure a corporate national security structure and we
[02:10:56.200 --> 02:11:00.840]  have one of the big experts on this somebody who was also warning of all this uh and now of course
[02:11:00.840 --> 02:11:05.720]  has been unfortunately vindicated but look at these documents we just got in the last week
[02:11:05.720 --> 02:11:11.880]  that are public shock docs total federalization of police new homeland security mission uh it says
[02:11:11.880 --> 02:11:18.520]  citizen spies body scanners on street corners the feds will hire all local police all that attract
[02:11:20.280 --> 02:11:23.960]  it's all these private companies with the former government heads making the money
[02:11:26.680 --> 02:11:32.520]  web censorship google admitting that's in the washington post here's another one secretary

[02:11:37.800 --> 02:11:43.720]  security press release saying everything's going to be tracked by them globally uh the military
[02:11:43.720 --> 02:11:50.840]  converting over to 50 drones by 2020 it'll be 90 drones they're now coming out the next phase of
[02:11:51.640 --> 02:11:59.240]  ground drones which again the elite can then command and won't say no to illegal orders
[02:11:59.240 --> 02:12:04.040]  could anybody could they have tried to overthrow hitler if he had robots no he had pretty close
[02:12:04.040 --> 02:12:12.040]  to robots biological brainwashed humans acting like robots but but this is a new level of tyranny
[02:12:12.040 --> 02:12:16.520]  secret arrest torture india and i just want to set the table there we've only got it for about
[02:12:16.520 --> 02:12:24.440]  25 minutes uh joining us uh here today is francis uh anthony boil is a professor of international

[02:12:51.960 --> 02:12:57.480]  uh nationalities united states of america the convenience there for cisco he also helped
[02:12:57.480 --> 02:13:01.800]  write the big biological weapons treaties i don't have time to go over at all but he's a leading
[02:13:01.800 --> 02:13:09.560]  expert uh francis you heard me preface you coming on with we really do have a global corporate
[02:13:09.560 --> 02:13:15.800]  tyranny running europe running the u.s that is overthrowing countries worldwide through proxies
[02:13:15.800 --> 02:13:21.000]  that is building massive force up against the people and now admitting it's for us
[02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:28.360]  what do you do when you're faced with a tyranny that's now out of the cradle not crawling on its
[02:13:28.360 --> 02:13:37.800]  on its legs ready to attack well thank you very much for uh have beyond uh alex yes the situation
[02:13:37.800 --> 02:13:47.000]  is uh progressively uh deteriorating uh i remember uh when you had your camera key team come in and
[02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:57.720]  interview me six months after uh president obama was inaugurated uh for your uh documentary on him
[02:13:57.720 --> 02:14:04.520]  being a threat to the republic and i had given obama the benefit of the doubt for uh for six months
[02:14:04.520 --> 02:14:12.360]  and after six months of uh what he was doing uh i concluded that it you know he was taking us
[02:14:12.360 --> 02:14:21.000]  down um and uh i had thought since he had taught constitutional law he was after me at harvard law
[02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:28.600]  school maybe he would be proceeding to dismantle uh some of the police state but instead he's made
[02:14:28.600 --> 02:14:36.280]  it worse and that's why i gave you that uh that interview to blow the whistle uh on obama and look
[02:14:36.280 --> 02:14:43.880]  what he's done uh since then the uh eyes uh amendments act that completely demolished the
[02:14:43.880 --> 02:14:52.600]  fourth amendment uh his murder list uh we now find out there two of them one uh maintained by uh
[02:14:52.600 --> 02:15:01.000]  jay sock one maintained by the cia uh all approved by out of the white house and us citizens are on
[02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:09.640]  that murder list uh the mbaa which obama approved it indeed insisted uh uh senator levin uh pointed
[02:15:09.640 --> 02:15:16.840]  this out uh that uh it also applied to us citizens uh it basically eliminated the uh
[02:15:16.840 --> 02:15:24.600]  positive commentator stacks so that the uh military can literally come in uh pick you and me up uh
[02:15:24.600 --> 02:15:31.800]  um and uh move us anywhere they want to this is called enforced disappearances it's an international
[02:15:31.800 --> 02:15:41.800]  crime um turn us over uh to uh some third country uh to to be tortured uh obama has said he'll
[02:15:41.800 --> 02:15:49.400]  continue the uh bush policy of extraordinary renditions which means it's a euphemism for uh
[02:15:49.400 --> 02:15:55.880]  enforced disappearances this is exactly what these uh military dictatorships down in latin america
[02:15:56.520 --> 02:16:04.680]  did with their uh death squads so now uh obama already has uh death squads abroad cia and uh
[02:16:05.320 --> 02:16:14.200]  jay sock and with the ndaa uh he is he's now in a position to start um unleashing his uh his death
[02:16:14.200 --> 02:16:21.960]  squads disappearance squads here in america uh what you can do i i think we all have to stand up
[02:16:21.960 --> 02:16:28.760]  um uh in accordance with our own own conscience and um try to fight back as as we've interviewed
[02:16:28.760 --> 02:16:37.720]  before i was put on all the united states government's terrorist watch lists back in the uh summer of
[02:16:37.720 --> 02:16:46.760]  uh 2006 by the fb i cia when i refused to become uh an informant on my uh arab and boson clients
[02:16:47.400 --> 02:16:54.760]  uh so i'm very high uh on this list uh i might i'm at risk certainly of uh uh as a result of the
[02:16:54.760 --> 02:17:01.240]  ndaa and uh obama's murder list and by the way chris hedges standing up and fighting the best i can
[02:17:01.240 --> 02:17:08.120]  here and i would encourage everyone else to to fight back in accordance with with your conscience
[02:17:08.680 --> 02:17:13.240]  yes sir and i want to expand on that but uh chris hedges as you know former new york times
[02:17:13.240 --> 02:17:17.480]  mental east bureau chief bullet surprise winner is having to sue them because he says under this
[02:17:18.040 --> 02:17:24.280]  he could be arrested and there's i mean it's coming out that ron paul this is in mainstream news
[02:17:24.280 --> 02:17:31.640]  has undercover military at his events because he wants to end the fed uh i've learned i've been
[02:17:31.640 --> 02:17:36.840]  falling around by the military uh they're having uh i've been sent the documents uh i guess they
[02:17:36.840 --> 02:17:43.960]  want me to know the the military is now spying on mainline peace groups uh they're spying on
[02:17:43.960 --> 02:17:51.560]  in the fed groups uh they are openly federalizing the local police and all of this is just beyond
[02:17:51.560 --> 02:17:57.960]  illegal i mean as you know as a constitutional lawyer it's illegal to tell a lawyer you're
[02:17:57.960 --> 02:18:03.400]  going to spy on your client it violates a bunch of laws but they put you on a no fly list now
[02:18:03.400 --> 02:18:08.440]  they're setting up tsa checkpoints and and and they've now released a new homeland security
[02:18:08.440 --> 02:18:12.920]  documents just three days ago you've been out of seen them where they admit to have a job you're
[02:18:12.920 --> 02:18:18.040]  going to be homeland security approved to to have a car to travel and that they're actually going to
[02:18:18.040 --> 02:18:27.480]  set up checkpoints on highways now uh mr boil i mean this is classical romanian chelcescu style
[02:18:27.480 --> 02:18:33.800]  control with a high tech overlay i mean it's it's joke level it's like if i was going to write a
[02:18:33.800 --> 02:18:39.720]  science fiction comedy i know kurt vonnegut wrote some absurdist future police state books
[02:18:39.720 --> 02:18:46.040]  that were supposed to be jokes i've now gone back and reread some of those and what they're now
[02:18:46.040 --> 02:18:53.480]  setting up is more than than a dark satire is what i'm saying it's so over the top well elix
[02:18:53.480 --> 02:19:01.880]  again i think you're correct after uh 9 11 i went back and uh reread two books george orwell's 1984
[02:19:01.880 --> 02:19:07.960]  and that is what we're living in today and also hannah errant's professor hannah errant's the
[02:19:07.960 --> 02:19:15.960]  origins of totalitarianism explaining uh the totalitarian systems as they developed in both
[02:19:15.960 --> 02:19:24.680]  uh hitler eye germany and stalinist uh russia and uh professor errant uh had was it was a
[02:19:24.680 --> 02:19:31.640]  jew who fled the nazis and germany came to the uh united states taught at the uh university of
[02:19:31.640 --> 02:19:38.280]  chicago had left just before i showed up there but uh i i read most of her things and one very
[02:19:38.280 --> 02:19:43.720]  interesting thing you you really need to go back and read errant especially the part on not well
[02:19:43.720 --> 02:19:52.200]  parts on not totalitarianism and then imperialism she had a chat section in there on um anti-semitism
[02:19:52.200 --> 02:19:58.920]  today the substitute for that of course is uh against uh muslim so you just read muslims yeah
[02:19:58.920 --> 02:20:04.120]  they always have a subgroup they beta tested on get approval and then they always expand it
[02:20:04.120 --> 02:20:09.400]  against the primary target everyone they want to rob that's correct right professor uh david
[02:20:09.400 --> 02:20:18.440]  coal uh georgetown law school uh has a book uh entitled enemy aliens in which he uh establishes
[02:20:18.440 --> 02:20:25.960]  that uh historically every totalitarian measure the united states government has originally taken
[02:20:25.960 --> 02:20:33.480]  against uh aliens it then applies to united states citizens what professor errant uh pointed out in
[02:20:33.480 --> 02:20:43.400]  her book is that um in both nazi germany is down as russia there were at least one informant for
[02:20:43.400 --> 02:20:52.360]  every eight people which was the uh uh size of an average family at that time so errant pointed out
[02:20:52.360 --> 02:20:59.080]  that what what was really going on in these total totalitarian states was that they were trying to
[02:20:59.080 --> 02:21:06.680]  break down the basic unit of their societies which which is the family exactly and now they have
[02:21:07.320 --> 02:21:12.520]  now they have telescreens as you know going in walmart's malls saying with with the homeland
[02:21:12.520 --> 02:21:18.760]  security director saying don't trust anyone but us i mean again it's it's cartoon level but but again
[02:21:18.760 --> 02:21:25.880]  we really have to read orwell's 1984 obviously um professor errant's book three books there are
[02:21:25.880 --> 02:21:34.440]  our our weighty tomes one would say but just read orwell's 1984 it's all there including
[02:21:34.440 --> 02:21:41.240]  waging uh perpetual perpetual warfare abroad uh in order to maintain the police state at home
[02:21:41.240 --> 02:21:48.200]  so i'd encourage everyone to just go out and get george orwell's 1984 and read it uh that is what
[02:21:48.200 --> 02:21:57.800]  is uh confronting us uh today you know uh war is peace uh uh slavery is freedom uh ignorance
[02:21:57.800 --> 02:22:03.880]  and strength and and we all love big brother so that that's yeah you know as you point out big
[02:22:03.880 --> 02:22:09.400]  sis there uh and obama yeah that that is what we're facing but there's even a self-fulfilling
[02:22:09.400 --> 02:22:15.960]  prophecy in it as they become completely tyrannical and there is no rule of law but they're jackboot
[02:22:15.960 --> 02:22:21.400]  then people are going to start resisting as the abuses get crazier and then that becomes
[02:22:21.400 --> 02:22:27.480]  the self-fulfilling prophecy of sea here's the domestic terrorist so uh there seems to be a
[02:22:27.480 --> 02:22:36.200]  method to the madness but at the same time um well that's correct elix because you see the ndaa
[02:22:36.840 --> 02:22:44.280]  was not about el keta which is totally non-existent and in any event was a cia concocted boogie man in
[02:22:44.280 --> 02:22:49.960]  the first place the nda after i just said well why they come up with the ndaa now the occupy
[02:22:49.960 --> 02:22:55.800]  wall street movement and the tea party movement that's why they came up with the ndaa it's not
[02:22:55.800 --> 02:23:05.320]  designed to uh to to go after el keta it's designed to go after um even peaceful law-abiding
[02:23:05.320 --> 02:23:12.840]  american people like the tea party movement like the occupy wall street movement that's why they
[02:23:12.840 --> 02:23:20.200]  rushed the nda through and obama insisted senator levin pointed this out that it applied to us
[02:23:20.200 --> 02:23:28.200]  citizens so they were getting everything uh all in place here uh for um the the next round of
[02:23:28.200 --> 02:23:34.680]  opposition to what they're doing and that's why in my opinion that is really how we have to understand
[02:23:34.680 --> 02:23:41.880]  the ndaa it's not after el keta it's after the tea party movement it's after the occupy wall street
[02:23:41.880 --> 02:23:47.160]  movement and things will get worse yes sure the john warranted defense authorization act of of
[02:23:47.160 --> 02:23:52.520]  2007 said you know we're getting rid of posse commentatus basically for insurrections in the
[02:23:52.520 --> 02:23:59.320]  states so so from your research why is the system the establishment gearing up against the people
[02:23:59.880 --> 02:24:04.920]  at a accelerated rate what what do they know is coming the economic collapse
[02:24:04.920 --> 02:24:13.880]  well it's that that economic collapse is already here they're just not prepared to call it and
[02:24:13.880 --> 02:24:23.720]  then uh second uh after 9 11 uh they decided to go for broke around the world and to steal
[02:24:24.280 --> 02:24:33.000]  all the oil and gas they possibly can everywhere uh in the world uh using 9 11 uh as a pretext and
[02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:41.800]  there's no going back so as they uh continue to wage wars in afghanistan iraq libya samalia yemen
[02:24:41.800 --> 02:24:47.480]  uh pakistan uh and who knows you know where else they're going to wage war they're they're going
[02:24:47.480 --> 02:24:54.760]  all out to steal as much oil and gas as they can uh they're now threatening uh iran uh they understand
[02:24:54.760 --> 02:25:02.040]  that this is antithetical to the maintenance of a republican system of government at home uh empire
[02:25:02.040 --> 02:25:10.600]  is uh antithetical to to a republic and if they attack iran which they are seriously threatening
[02:25:10.600 --> 02:25:17.000]  to do they could set off world war three and that's what they're they're preparing for last weekend
[02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:23.560]  you know and i'm not exaggerating anything last weekend they sent a u.s uh uh aircraft carrier
[02:25:23.560 --> 02:25:31.160]  strike force with french and british ships ships through the strait of four moons basically
[02:25:31.160 --> 02:25:39.800]  daring uh the the iranians to attack them and fully prepared to to set that war off uh so uh
[02:25:39.800 --> 02:25:48.920]  we really uh hang by a thread here from a world war if we attack iran uh that could very easily
[02:25:48.920 --> 02:25:55.480]  pull in uh russia and china and both russia and china have stated publicly that a u.s israeli
[02:25:55.480 --> 02:26:02.520]  attack in iran with threatened their vital national security interests so they're preparing um the
[02:26:02.520 --> 02:26:08.280]  groundwork here in america for massive resistance yeah that's right because because they're going
[02:26:08.280 --> 02:26:13.880]  to go after their opposition even if we don't stand up to them during the war uh as all tyrants do
[02:26:13.880 --> 02:26:19.080]  and they're following a exact blueprint of what's been tested and worked before uh but looking at
[02:26:19.080 --> 02:26:23.160]  this you know being a historian mostly being a lawyer knowing and studying the psychology of
[02:26:23.160 --> 02:26:31.240]  these people what concerns me most uh mr boil is that is that they're not they've got a lot of
[02:26:31.240 --> 02:26:35.880]  experts that are really smart advising them on pieces of it but the people actually giving the
[02:26:35.880 --> 02:26:42.520]  general commands and orders do not seem to be as connected to reality as even their more informed
[02:26:42.520 --> 02:26:50.440]  minions and i mean i mean take course one thing we can hope for is that they are so arrogant with
[02:26:50.440 --> 02:26:58.920]  power there in washington dc that they don't really understand what's going out here in the
[02:26:58.920 --> 02:27:04.440]  hinterlands with with the people they don't understand the tea party movement they don't
[02:27:04.440 --> 02:27:09.880]  understand the occupy wall street movement they really don't understand that and i think that's
[02:27:09.880 --> 02:27:15.640]  correct i mean look at obama uh look at uh look at romney you know romney and i were uh
[02:27:15.640 --> 02:27:21.080]  classmates together at harvard law school section mates we took all our uh first year courses
[02:27:21.080 --> 02:27:29.240]  together uh once you get into these uh so-called elite uh uh programs uh like like at harvard you
[02:27:29.240 --> 02:27:36.680]  you just get immediately uh uh co-opted brainwashed and totally out of touch with reality so that
[02:27:37.240 --> 02:27:45.160]  that is the one thing i think that is in our favor and look at romney campaigning obama
[02:27:45.160 --> 02:27:50.120]  campaigning you know they don't have a clue uh well that was my next question to you though that
[02:27:50.120 --> 02:27:55.720]  was my next question is that look at corazon who made a 40 to one bet with other people's private
[02:27:55.720 --> 02:28:00.120]  bank accounts and then doesn't get in trouble when he gets caught lying and he's the main
[02:28:00.120 --> 02:28:06.600]  white house financial advisor i mean i i know we can hope they follow summer's is even worse uh
[02:28:06.600 --> 02:28:12.520]  so you know yeah summer's summer's was fired by harvard because uh he publicly stated uh women
[02:28:12.520 --> 02:28:18.360]  uh are dumber than men when it comes to math and science and then uh if you take a look at this
[02:28:18.360 --> 02:28:23.560]  new set of articles just coming out in or memos just coming out of the new yorker he was the one
[02:28:23.560 --> 02:28:30.360]  who uh uh pioneered the uh rape of our economy for his bodies on wall street the banks and the
[02:28:30.360 --> 02:28:37.400]  henchmen but that's what i'm saying is they're so crazy reckless hubris hootspa i mean what do you
[02:28:37.400 --> 02:28:44.920]  call it they are mad dogs well this is the way people at these elite institutions get get trained
[02:28:44.920 --> 02:28:51.480]  uh what can i say i i spent 10 years at the university of chicago and harvard and uh i have
[02:28:51.480 --> 02:28:57.400]  three degrees from harvard went through the same programs that produce romney um uh and obama
[02:28:57.400 --> 02:29:02.920]  uh that that's that's just the way you get trained and you get brainwashed and uh you get
[02:29:02.920 --> 02:29:10.040]  co-opted and moved along to do this type of work you know for uh the money bags behind the scenes
[02:29:10.040 --> 02:29:16.440]  who are pulling the strings now behind uh uh obama was brashinsky behind brashinsky is
[02:29:16.440 --> 02:29:23.400]  david rockefeller behind kissinger is david rockefeller um both brashinsky and kissinger
[02:29:23.400 --> 02:29:28.360]  have been on rock i'll tell you what a professor stay there just a few more minutes on the side
[02:29:28.360 --> 02:29:32.600]  of you can because i want you to finish what you're saying and then talk about ideas for solutions

[02:29:36.200 --> 02:29:40.680]  that's been inside their inner sanctums and talked about it so let's talk about that for as long as

[02:32:03.560 --> 02:32:08.200]  now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the arctic circle did you know that
[02:32:08.200 --> 02:32:13.240]  in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds
[02:32:13.240 --> 02:32:17.000]  have all performed even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even
[02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:21.800]  happen again so our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of
[02:32:21.800 --> 02:32:28.440]  non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient

[02:32:44.040 --> 02:32:50.040]  a call at eight seven seven three two seven zero three six five that's eight seven seven three two
[02:32:50.040 --> 02:32:56.760]  seven zero three six five remember in a real crisis non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter
[02:32:56.760 --> 02:33:12.680]  item this is alex jones for survival seed bank dot com
[02:33:17.560 --> 02:33:21.880]  my friends there are always groups throughout history that want to get control and then want
[02:33:21.880 --> 02:33:27.960]  to use the country they've taken over to take over the next country and there's a method of the
[02:33:27.960 --> 02:33:33.560]  madness because to commit the crimes that tyrants have to commit to get into power they have to
[02:33:33.560 --> 02:33:38.440]  keep expanding and persecuting or they're going to end up having their enemies come after them or
[02:33:38.440 --> 02:33:44.440]  be brought to justice so these are ponzi scheme operators the people like larry summers and
[02:33:44.440 --> 02:33:49.400]  getting rid of glass stegel and the derivatives who instead of getting in trouble well they're too
[02:33:49.400 --> 02:33:53.560]  big to fail they just take over the whole society and after the professor leaves us here in about
[02:33:53.560 --> 02:34:01.880]  10 minutes the articles are pouring in in la and in cities all over the us la pd and special forces
[02:34:01.880 --> 02:34:07.640]  conduct military maneuvers in the skies above downtown la and i've been to these drills they
[02:34:07.640 --> 02:34:13.240]  are there over and over again to acclimate the public to military occupation now i'd be called
[02:34:13.240 --> 02:34:18.200]  a kook even when i had footage of this because oh that wouldn't happen in america now it's like well
[02:34:18.200 --> 02:34:24.040]  you bet they're here to you know to help deal with domestic extremist then you get the domestic
[02:34:24.040 --> 02:34:29.560]  extremist documents muslim folks who are the beta test they aren't even on the radar it's all about
[02:34:29.560 --> 02:34:37.480]  gun owners conservatives libertarians anti-war activist rural groups especially refuse nicks
[02:34:37.480 --> 02:34:42.680]  people that just want to live in the country be left alone oh look out you've got to be part of
[02:34:42.680 --> 02:34:48.920]  this system black market economies million dollar fines for garage sales resting people
[02:34:48.920 --> 02:34:55.000]  with lemonade stands they want you to know that that that that you know that average citizens who
[02:34:55.000 --> 02:35:00.760]  aren't criminal types you're going to be shaken down you're going to be groped by tsa it's all here
[02:35:00.760 --> 02:35:06.920]  now dr boil professor boil i was getting into you know in harvard in the same elite program that
[02:35:06.920 --> 02:35:11.800]  kissinger and all of them came out of and you know being in there with mitt romney and the rest of it
[02:35:11.800 --> 02:35:16.840]  and in the same offices afterwards you know after kissinger had left you know they were pretty much
[02:35:16.840 --> 02:35:21.720]  offering him that job so he's one of the unique people who was inside of there and since you're
[02:35:21.720 --> 02:35:27.880]  bringing it up please start over where you talked about who's behind obama who's behind brzezinski
[02:35:27.880 --> 02:35:37.480]  and please continue with giving us a bird's-eye view or an inside view on exactly how this servant
[02:35:37.480 --> 02:35:43.160]  class super servant class to the big moneyed interest how they're exactly brainwashed what
[02:35:43.160 --> 02:35:50.120]  their worldview is right well uh we know uh for a fact that obama's mentor at columbia was uh
[02:35:50.120 --> 02:35:57.160]  brzezinski and then he went to work for a cia front organization john tilger established that
[02:35:57.160 --> 02:36:06.600]  so obama has been a uh cia asset since at least that one cia always cia um american foreign policy
[02:36:06.600 --> 02:36:14.360]  starting with 1968 has been controlled and dominated by kissinger and his protege on the
[02:36:14.360 --> 02:36:20.840]  uh republican side and then uh starting with the carter administration on the democratic uh side
[02:36:21.800 --> 02:36:26.920]  brzezinski and his protege it's either one group or the other but they're pretty much the same
[02:36:27.480 --> 02:36:36.440]  it is also matter public record that uh both um brzezinski and kissinger have been for decades
[02:36:36.440 --> 02:36:43.640]  on the payroll of david rockefeller and the rockefeller family and before that we know that
[02:36:43.640 --> 02:36:51.240]  kissinger uh is and still is a spook uh army counterintelligence uh during world war two
[02:36:51.800 --> 02:36:58.440]  and apparently recently he was uh joking in his uh latest meeting with putin that yes they
[02:36:58.440 --> 02:37:07.800]  they were both spooks putin uh uh kgb you know once kgb always kgb once cia always cia as for
[02:37:07.800 --> 02:37:15.720]  uh brzezinski you know he showed up at harvard 1955 56 to get his phd uh during world war two
[02:37:15.720 --> 02:37:21.560]  a good deal of the harvard faculty joined the uh os s to fight the nazis which was fine
[02:37:22.200 --> 02:37:28.360]  but they came back and then they became a primary uh recruiting ground for the cia and the same thing
[02:37:28.360 --> 02:37:34.600]  uh happened happened at yale and they brought in a ton of nazis to teach them all their anti-soviet
[02:37:34.600 --> 02:37:40.600]  tricks and basically uh became what they'd been fighting that's exactly what happened as we know
[02:37:41.640 --> 02:37:52.360]  uh after world war two uh os s uh co-opted the uh uh uh the nazi uh intelligence and many uh high
[02:37:52.360 --> 02:37:59.240]  level uh uh nazi operatives there was operation paperclip where large numbers of high level nazis
[02:37:59.240 --> 02:38:07.000]  were brought in either by os s or by uh army intelligence here uh into the united states
[02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:14.360]  or uh shipped down to uh latin america all on condition that uh they cooperate with us uh against
[02:38:14.360 --> 02:38:21.400]  the soviet union you're correct and it just gets crazier and crazier so so working in and around
[02:38:21.400 --> 02:38:28.360]  this we know the global governance model is a global banking system that basically carries out a
[02:38:28.360 --> 02:38:34.520]  eugenics operations against the world if if if you were brought into the inner sanctum of this
[02:38:35.720 --> 02:38:40.440]  at a higher level grooming level why did you break with it when did you break
[02:38:40.440 --> 02:38:47.480]  i mean was it a process how did that happen well as for the eugenics we know for a fact
[02:38:47.480 --> 02:38:54.680]  this is a matter of public record that uh kissinger working for uh nixon adopted a national
[02:38:54.680 --> 02:39:04.040]  security directive stating quite clearly that uh population control uh i.e. eugenics uh is part
[02:39:04.040 --> 02:39:10.200]  of a uh vital national security interest of the united states of america and i believe probably
[02:39:10.200 --> 02:39:17.400]  since uh since the adoption of that national security directive uh that has been uh u.s foreign
[02:39:17.400 --> 02:39:24.440]  policy around the world on the various problems that that were seen one way or the other uh well
[02:39:24.440 --> 02:39:32.440]  you know as for me um i don't know i was uh appalled by the uh vietnam war so appalled that
[02:39:32.440 --> 02:39:39.320]  uh i guess at the end of uh my third year in high school trying to figure you know what what
[02:39:39.320 --> 02:39:47.400]  contribution i could make uh i decided uh to get the most elite education i possibly could
[02:39:48.120 --> 02:39:54.600]  and then come out and turn it against these people back in those days uh the vietnam war these were
[02:39:54.600 --> 02:40:02.360]  the uh best and the brightest uh as as uh helbert stamp spoke with that name uh and those were all
[02:40:02.360 --> 02:40:07.640]  the harvard people that that generation and so you were so dedicated to peace and not having
[02:40:07.640 --> 02:40:13.400]  imperial wars that you actually made the perfect grades and everything to go and be in the middle
[02:40:13.400 --> 02:40:20.520]  of that wow that's dedication yeah ten years um at the university of chicago the home of all the
[02:40:20.520 --> 02:40:26.920]  neocons there where the neocon movement uh was uh founded what did you do the whole time you were
[02:40:26.920 --> 02:40:31.160]  amongst them and like you know working with mint romney and around all these people i mean do you
[02:40:31.160 --> 02:40:37.720]  i just keep your mouth shut no i argued all the time oh really oh sure i argued all the time with
[02:40:37.720 --> 02:40:42.920]  everyone uh constantly right um you know what could i say well what did they think of that
[02:40:42.920 --> 02:40:46.520]  because i mean i've read these reports and had a lot of historians on in fact i've had some of them
[02:40:46.520 --> 02:40:52.920]  on uh you know famous lawyers historians people like yourself where you know in the 1957 they'd be
[02:40:52.920 --> 02:41:00.280]  in a you know college uh line at the cafeteria and david rockefeller would walk up and recruit
[02:41:00.280 --> 02:41:05.000]  him right there i mean obviously the elite are big on recruiting people and i've read a lot of times
[02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:12.120]  they think oh you're gonna argue now later you'll turn to their dark side uh regretfully that happens
[02:41:12.120 --> 02:41:18.360]  to a lot of people uh at chicago and harvard that as as time goes on i mean i could have been one of
[02:41:18.360 --> 02:41:24.920]  these people very easily with no problem at all so you know i tell my three sons um i could have had
[02:41:24.920 --> 02:41:31.160]  all the power all the money and all the fame uh i wanted but instead i'm you know out there doing
[02:41:31.160 --> 02:41:37.000]  what i'm doing now trying to stand with the uh poor oppressed and downtrodden people the world and
[02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:41.400]  now our own people but you know that's where the humanity and the strength and the energy and the
[02:41:41.400 --> 02:41:46.680]  value is these these globalists with all this petty power and these egomaniacs they're in
[02:41:46.680 --> 02:41:55.000]  they're unhappy they're in prisons well i guess psychologically uh they are there you know they
[02:41:55.000 --> 02:42:03.240]  i think maybe some of them i saw this a lot at uh certainly at uh harvard where you had you know
[02:42:03.240 --> 02:42:10.120]  very bright idealistic uh young people going to harvard uh making wanting to make the world a better
[02:42:10.120 --> 02:42:15.640]  place and then they were pretty much brainwashed and they came out to be monsters uh after four
[02:42:15.640 --> 02:42:23.080]  years or seven years in the case of romney uh he was a pirate from the first place um and we all
[02:42:23.080 --> 02:42:31.800]  knew it but anyone who went into the jd mba program at harvard law school and harvard business school
[02:42:32.520 --> 02:42:39.160]  which romney did in 1971 and we started you first started harvard law school but everyone who went
[02:42:39.160 --> 02:42:44.440]  into that we all knew at the time was just going to be an outright pirate that's the only reason
[02:42:44.440 --> 02:42:51.400]  you go into that program and then after graduating he went to work for a boston consulting group and
[02:42:51.400 --> 02:42:55.880]  again everyone if you do anything about boston consulting group you're new full well everyone
[02:42:55.880 --> 02:43:03.160]  who went there was going there to become a pirate and then uh bayne who had been a partner uh at
[02:43:03.160 --> 02:43:09.480]  a boston consulting group set up his own firm and he recruited uh romney out of boston consulting
[02:43:09.480 --> 02:43:16.680]  group to become a super pirate so that's really uh you know what what romney's uh all about and
[02:43:16.680 --> 02:43:21.800]  you know you're reading about his uh tax returns and things oh yeah then again doesn't pay taxes
[02:43:21.800 --> 02:43:27.400]  i think uh you know despite what the mainstream news media is telling you uh i think there's a
[02:43:27.400 --> 02:43:33.160]  lot of unreported uh income there that uh romney just hasn't come clean on i mean you have to ask
[02:43:33.160 --> 02:43:41.320]  yourself why did he have a uh uh secret bank account switzerland with ubs and then what happens is
[02:43:41.880 --> 02:43:48.680]  the united states government and the irs the department of treasury go after ubs and then
[02:43:48.680 --> 02:43:57.400]  they start pressuring the swiss government to have ubs uh uh come clean on its uh uh us
[02:43:57.400 --> 02:44:03.800]  depositors and then all of a sudden romney shuts down his ubs account so you know i i think you
[02:44:03.800 --> 02:44:09.640]  know we really need people to start looking into these uh secret bank accounts that he maintained
[02:44:09.640 --> 02:44:15.480]  in the uh cayman islands uh switzerland uh bermuda you know if you read the new york times the
[02:44:15.480 --> 02:44:22.280]  world street journal uh they only have people in there basically uh presenting uh romney's point
[02:44:22.280 --> 02:44:28.280]  of view on these issues but you know i i i have no inside information and i i don't have time to
[02:44:28.280 --> 02:44:34.440]  sit and read through uh but by super pirate it's sculling bones that's what they call themselves
[02:44:34.440 --> 02:44:41.000]  dancing yale that is if you go to yale unlike harvard harvard has its secret clubs too yale
[02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:48.200]  uh skull and bones and you know you saw that movie uh with uh robert uh deniro and mad daemon
[02:44:48.200 --> 02:44:53.560]  that the uh cia recruited now the good shepherd skull and bones right and they they recruited
[02:44:53.560 --> 02:45:01.240]  bush jr. well bush jr's father was cia and we know that after his uh uh graduation from yale
[02:45:01.240 --> 02:45:07.560]  uh his father had him work for a cia front organization so he was cia and he's still cia
[02:45:08.440 --> 02:45:15.160]  carry skull and bones uh you know special forces in vietnam so you know you have two skull and
[02:45:15.160 --> 02:45:21.000]  bones guys um uh running for the uh for the president it's amazing let me ask you this question
[02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:25.560]  what from your study what's obviously they're in game is take over the planet shut down domestic
[02:45:25.560 --> 02:45:32.120]  descent do all of this uh convert the military over to drones it'll follow orders uh all of this
[02:45:32.120 --> 02:45:38.040]  but i mean there's got to be there's got to be an end to it and i think it's just going to be the
[02:45:38.040 --> 02:45:43.640]  country collapsing and the dollar collapsing because it doesn't look like all this military force
[02:45:43.640 --> 02:45:49.160]  they're piling up against us and others is going to make it for them i mean i don't i don't i don't
[02:45:49.160 --> 02:45:57.000]  see him finishing this marathon well i think from their perspective it would be to start a war with
[02:45:57.000 --> 02:46:03.720]  a rand that could then end up with you know a major type world war and then they would have
[02:46:03.720 --> 02:46:09.000]  all the justification they need to impose a police state uh here in america outright yeah that's it
[02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:15.400]  sort of like what happened in uh uh world war two and we would all then become a cogsome machine
[02:46:16.200 --> 02:46:23.320]  that i think that that is their ultimate plan yeah it's 1984 it's 1984 it's exactly yes it's
[02:46:23.320 --> 02:46:31.640]  exactly like 1984 and i i would encourage everyone to go out and and read reread 1984 uh that is is
[02:46:31.640 --> 02:46:36.600]  where we are today sure and of course they finally figure is out in the book he's like i think one
[02:46:36.600 --> 02:46:42.760]  government is running both sides and we're it's miscelling itself because it's just an excuse to
[02:46:42.760 --> 02:46:49.240]  always degrade society trampling and being trampled upon it it is just you know in closing you say
[02:46:49.240 --> 02:46:57.400]  you knew romney real well generous i knew him really well but we do take uh all of our first year
[02:46:57.400 --> 02:47:02.840]  law classes together okay so you know a class every day for an entire year sure so you know i mean
[02:47:02.840 --> 02:47:09.960]  here's the deal just just gauging a person newt genrich just just radiates crazy out of control
[02:47:10.520 --> 02:47:18.200]  really wicked person and then his actions show that romney kind of like with obama uh it's just
[02:47:18.200 --> 02:47:24.600]  mainly hyper competitive no morals but i mean would you say that he's consciously like a psychopath
[02:47:24.600 --> 02:47:33.320]  yeah yeah is he just just a uh super competitive pirate he's certainly a pirate there's no question
[02:47:33.320 --> 02:47:39.000]  about it and that's why he went to that into that jd mba program harvard law school harvard
[02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:46.280]  business school and i believe even at the time we knew uh he his father had just run for the
[02:47:46.280 --> 02:47:54.440]  presidency and lost and it was clear uh he intended at least to me my assessment he intended
[02:47:54.440 --> 02:48:00.920]  to go out become a pirate make as much money as he possibly could and then uh at that point
[02:48:00.920 --> 02:48:08.440]  run for the presidency so in fact this is a lifelong plan uh by romney probably going back to
[02:48:09.160 --> 02:48:17.320]  1968 when his uh his father lost the presidency wow and and again in between obama and and romney
[02:48:17.320 --> 02:48:23.800]  it just shows the corporate system has finally gotten it where it really is nothing but reshuffling
[02:48:23.800 --> 02:48:29.880]  deck chairs on the titanic and that this is all a facade and then ron paul enters the fray
[02:48:30.440 --> 02:48:36.280]  and is the only real candidate who who isn't bought and paid for and it's messing up their whole
[02:48:36.280 --> 02:48:42.760]  alice in wonderland uh false reality i mean uh briefly your take on ron paul and his view i think
[02:48:42.760 --> 02:48:47.400]  i think you're correct about that you know as a lawyer and a law professor for many years now
[02:48:47.400 --> 02:48:55.560]  uh uh ron paul is the only candidate who uh expressed concern about the constitution and the
[02:48:55.560 --> 02:49:01.880]  rule of law and as you know for well that was long before he decided to run for presidency
[02:49:02.600 --> 02:49:11.640]  after 9 11 is when i began to pay attention to ron paul uh when he began to object to the police
[02:49:11.640 --> 02:49:20.680]  state tactics by uh bush and the uh wars abroad so he has consistently taken this position uh after
[02:49:20.680 --> 02:49:29.240]  9 11 to to my knowledge when i began to uh follow him and he still is today uh romney will be no
[02:49:29.240 --> 02:49:37.000]  better perhaps worse uh than than obama i guess the difference is you know obama is a cia asset
[02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:44.520]  uh romney is not but he's still a pirate basically romney's uh an agent for the uh for the uh
[02:49:44.520 --> 02:49:53.800]  Mormon pope uh romney uh was uh and perhaps still is a uh a Mormon bishop uh he had been a Mormon
[02:49:53.800 --> 02:50:00.520]  archbishop and given the uh high uh uh hierarchical structure of that church i believe he has always
[02:50:00.520 --> 02:50:08.520]  taken uh his orders from the uh uh from the Mormon uh profit so that's that's what we're facing uh
[02:50:08.520 --> 02:50:17.640]  now as we know a lot of the uh Mormon's now in the uh uh cia fbi uh military uh and uh and things of
[02:50:17.640 --> 02:50:23.160]  uh so basically our government has just turned into a bunch of special interest grabbing at
[02:50:23.160 --> 02:50:28.280]  levers of power and that's the only fight is special interest scrabbling around fighting over
[02:50:28.280 --> 02:50:36.440]  the levers i i believe uh you're right and it you know when the campaign comes up from my perspective
[02:50:36.440 --> 02:50:45.000]  the most important thing is to get our constitution back if this can be done uh sure we want america
[02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:50.360]  back to do that we want america back if we're gonna make any changes at all we have to get the
[02:50:50.360 --> 02:50:58.440]  constitution back and dismantle this uh police state uh going back uh at least uh to the usa
[02:50:58.440 --> 02:51:03.240]  patriot act and eat the food we gotta go to break gotta go to break do you know which 37 crucial

[02:54:13.640 --> 02:54:18.360]  kansas anymore we're not in america anymore if we're going to get the republic back we've got to be
[02:54:18.360 --> 02:54:24.760]  honest about how much trouble we're in this is so real folks and they've geared up so long for all
[02:54:24.760 --> 02:54:29.800]  out war with the people they do plan arrest all of it once they go into the next phase of this they
[02:54:29.800 --> 02:54:35.480]  do plan on a civil war they do plan they want that fight with the people they want the reeducation
[02:54:35.480 --> 02:54:40.760]  they want it all the i mean the these people are all about the exercise of power and i have to have
[02:54:40.760 --> 02:54:46.280]  debates with my wife about not leaving this country uh you know professor you're talking about restore
[02:54:46.280 --> 02:54:51.480]  the republic legalize freedom again recognize what's happened we were talking during the break
[02:54:51.480 --> 02:54:55.640]  i mean just in closing people can learn more in your latest book tackling america's toughest
[02:54:55.640 --> 02:55:01.000]  question available at amazon dot com and bookstores but i mean just say what you were saying to me
[02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:05.080]  off air i mean we're talking about 9 11 they did it they did the anthrax this shows you who were
[02:55:05.080 --> 02:55:11.000]  dealing with them and these are some hardcore murderers oh true uh we've discussed the anthrax
[02:55:11.000 --> 02:55:17.160]  before uh and i do have a book on that uh bio warfare and uh terrorism it's obvious it's very
[02:55:17.160 --> 02:55:24.760]  clear the anthrax this was super weapons grade anthrax prepared by the cia uh department of
[02:55:24.760 --> 02:55:33.560]  defense probably uh but tell and it was unleashed to uh ram the uh usa uh patriot act set up a
[02:55:33.560 --> 02:55:39.480]  police state they shut down congress they shut down the supreme court and and they killed our own
[02:55:39.480 --> 02:55:46.360]  people so uh any uh group of people that that would do that and basically it was uh it was
[02:55:46.360 --> 02:55:53.000]  politicized they they they shut down constitutional government when they shut down congress they shut
[02:55:53.000 --> 02:56:00.600]  down the supreme court uh so any uh elite that would do something like that uh against its own
[02:56:00.600 --> 02:56:08.360]  people will stop at nothing and they undoubtedly still have a uh stockpile of that um super weapons
[02:56:08.360 --> 02:56:15.640]  grade uh anthrax still out there either a dugway or betel uh fort detrick who knows that and you're
[02:56:15.640 --> 02:56:19.800]  a bio weapons expert and help write global treaties on it but as you know they're also
[02:56:19.800 --> 02:56:28.680]  producing a bunch of airborne nasty flues pox's and uh and uh abola now i mean heaven help us we
[02:56:28.680 --> 02:56:35.960]  are in the hands of total psychopaths i believe that's correct the the if you look at the uh funding
[02:56:35.960 --> 02:56:42.760]  for uh bio warfare after 9 11 now it's somewhere in the area of about uh 70 billion dollars
[02:56:42.760 --> 02:56:51.560]  uh which in constant uh money is more than the uh manhattan project uh we are uh geared up to uh
[02:56:51.560 --> 02:56:59.480]  fight uh biological uh warfare uh there's no question about it and we now have close to uh
[02:56:59.480 --> 02:57:07.880]  i'd say 400 labs uh researching extremely dangerous uh bio warfare agents maybe 15 uh
[02:57:07.880 --> 02:57:13.800]  thousand people death scientists i call them the national institutes of health has been
[02:57:13.800 --> 02:57:19.640]  thoroughly corrupted it's now the national institutes for death center for deep disease control
[02:57:19.640 --> 02:57:24.280]  has now been become the uh center for disease proliferation and now they're killing a lot of
[02:57:24.280 --> 02:57:30.840]  scientists everywhere they don't play ball but what's your number uh last number i read was about
[02:57:30.840 --> 02:57:38.760]  26 uh uh were killed uh microbiologists yeah it could be higher but the last figure we're gonna
