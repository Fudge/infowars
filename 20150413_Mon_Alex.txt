[00:00.000 --> 00:14.640]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.640 --> 00:39.640]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen it's another
[00:39.640 --> 00:47.920]  live worldwide broadcast of the it's Monday the 13th day of April 2015 I'm your host Alex Jones
[00:47.920 --> 00:53.960]  we don't have any guests today because there is so much news to get to there is just tons of news
[00:53.960 --> 01:00.720]  I don't know where to start Hillary Clinton is now billing herself as a simple person a
[01:00.720 --> 01:08.240]  simple kind of man a simple kind of woman and so it's a gimmick she's driving around the country
[01:08.240 --> 01:17.080]  in a van a thousand mile trip she started in a van she's a common person battling the 1%
[01:17.080 --> 01:23.440]  all Watson has an article Hillary vows to protect Americans from the 1% while being funded by the
[01:23.440 --> 01:29.360]  1% we need to really have an article correcting this and we've done the math they demonize the
[01:29.360 --> 01:37.440]  1% if you're making 300 plus thousand dollars a year you're in the 1% and most people making
[01:37.440 --> 01:48.240]  300,000 a year are the folks buying cars buying houses having large outlays of money in the service
[01:48.240 --> 01:56.080]  economy every study shows that so the the system is busy demonizing the 1% if you look at the
[01:56.080 --> 02:00.880]  billionaires most of which are globalist and insiders that make their money out of government
[02:00.880 --> 02:10.480]  deals and centralized monopoly capitalism we've done the math before but it's point zero zero
[02:10.480 --> 02:15.280]  zero zero and then you can debate the numbers after that you're talking about five six zeros and
[02:15.280 --> 02:22.960]  then you start looking at the six thousand people in the Kissinger groups on analysis Rothkopf's
[02:22.960 --> 02:30.160]  breakdown of it that actually run the planet and a lot of those six thousand people only have
[02:30.160 --> 02:34.320]  you know fifty sixty seventy million dollars in the bank and that sounds like a lot but there is
[02:34.320 --> 02:41.040]  now talk about the first trillionaires and apple is set to become a trillion dollar company
[02:41.600 --> 02:46.720]  and that's part of the devaluation of the currency and if you had a hundred million dollars
[02:47.440 --> 02:53.440]  back in the 40s that was like having ten billion dollars today so yeah there's over a thousand
[02:53.440 --> 03:01.200]  billionaires globally and they're adding more all the time there's the headline got a trillion the
[03:01.200 --> 03:06.400]  world's first trillionaires already in the making and so i should probably do a whole special report
[03:06.400 --> 03:10.880]  on this i guess i could just do it on air kind of a special report sawers here on the radio a
[03:10.880 --> 03:15.280]  lot of times i just go off my memory which is pretty accurate but then i'll say you know what
[03:15.280 --> 03:20.560]  this is important enough let me pull all the proof of that and really back up what i'm saying
[03:20.560 --> 03:26.480]  which is kind of what we do live time if you're a tv viewer you get an added dimension and i'd say
[03:26.480 --> 03:32.400]  only 15 percent of our overall listeners are viewers but that's really what you can't argue with
[03:32.400 --> 03:36.720]  because i'm just sitting here making these claims our great crew in there aren't just switching
[03:37.280 --> 03:42.240]  you know cameras and punching buttons they're also searching what i'm saying and you know staying on
[03:42.240 --> 03:47.840]  me you know sometimes i uh get things wrong in fact quite often i mean usually i just get a date
[03:47.840 --> 03:56.560]  wrong or i flip numbers around or they're like no alex it's it's it's not that guns are used 14 times
[03:56.560 --> 04:01.200]  more often to stop crime than be committing crimes it's something like 47 times and they'll
[04:01.200 --> 04:08.880]  pull up the new study it all varies the point is we're a lot more accurate than what the establishment
[04:08.880 --> 04:17.040]  pundits are putting out most the time mainstream media itself is pretty darn accurate it's just
[04:17.040 --> 04:21.440]  that those stories don't get any attention but if something's getting promoted is the top story
[04:22.560 --> 04:28.160]  if something's getting pushed as the big establishment drive like carbon taxes global
[04:28.160 --> 04:35.520]  warming stuff like that then you know it's super super phony but more and more the public's not
[04:35.520 --> 04:40.560]  buying any of it so even the establishment is now turning on hillary clinton we'll break that down
[04:40.560 --> 04:45.920]  coming up parents in trouble again for letting kids walk alone what's behind the nanny state we'll
[04:45.920 --> 04:51.600]  break it down the guardian reports the government hide surveillance programs just because people would

[08:11.360 --> 08:20.640]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones crashing through the lies and disinformation
[08:20.640 --> 08:25.280]  i was driving into work this morning and just thinking about how huge
[08:27.360 --> 08:33.840]  a crisis we face with the criminal elite of the planet synthesizing and developing different
[08:33.840 --> 08:41.200]  criminal systems of fraud and manipulation but at the same time for every action there's an
[08:41.200 --> 08:47.280]  equal and opposite reaction in newtonian physics and we know that in this third dimension that law
[08:47.280 --> 08:55.120]  is sound and true and so it is the epic challenge of the globalist assault on their fellow man
[08:56.080 --> 09:01.760]  that will separate the boys from the men the women from the girls the pro humans from the
[09:01.760 --> 09:10.960]  anti humans the parasites from the lovers the builders it is an incredible time to be alive
[09:10.960 --> 09:18.240]  and the sophisticated attacks we face are legion but number one it is the prosperity
[09:18.880 --> 09:28.480]  of civilization and the renaissance is the sea we swim in and it is that unparalleled
[09:28.480 --> 09:33.120]  prosperity even with a hundred million plus people not working in this country and similar
[09:33.120 --> 09:40.560]  numbers around the world that allows the great evil to grow so it's a paradox many
[09:40.560 --> 09:46.960]  historians pointed out the cycle of you go into great tyranny great oppression there is
[09:46.960 --> 09:53.360]  sometimes hundreds of years of not thousands of of dark ages and pain then as things get worse and
[09:53.360 --> 10:00.560]  worse a cadre of heroes emerge out of that incredible pressure some diamonds are created
[10:01.680 --> 10:08.560]  that gives rise to a new civilization based on liberty and renaissance and individual honor
[10:08.560 --> 10:13.600]  and strength and voting with your actions
[10:16.320 --> 10:25.280]  and then you develop renaissance you develop great times of human enlightenment and acceleration
[10:25.280 --> 10:32.880]  of understanding and technological discoveries compounding on discovery compounding on discovery
[10:32.880 --> 10:39.040]  milk and honey milk and honey flowing through the streets but within that ether of the milk
[10:39.040 --> 10:46.400]  and honey grows the disease of decadence of slovenliness and within the complexity of freedom
[10:46.400 --> 10:53.200]  and the complexity of its true diversity within the giant structure of endless amazement
[10:54.960 --> 11:01.200]  people become decadent they become sauded they become foppish they become dandies
[11:01.200 --> 11:08.400]  they become focused on petty things and that's just the general public then the parasites hide in
[11:08.400 --> 11:15.440]  the complexity and begin to turn things around and wage war at a spiritual instinctive level
[11:17.040 --> 11:22.560]  the tyrants should love the producers the paradigm the parasite should love the dreamers
[11:22.560 --> 11:28.560]  and love the builders because that gives them a bigger coral reef ecosystem to live in but no
[11:28.560 --> 11:36.800]  no no they instinctively spiritually have enmity and hatred for the builders the constructors
[11:38.480 --> 11:43.840]  because they're jealous of it and envious and know that you're much more powerful than them
[11:43.840 --> 11:49.280]  at a spiritual level you're just blinding light to them beautiful and huge and magnificent
[11:49.920 --> 11:55.520]  and they hate you they want to extinguish you they want to live off the rubble of what we've built
[11:55.520 --> 12:04.080]  and a microcosm of this is the internet you say a microcosm the internet's gigantic now it's tiny
[12:04.080 --> 12:11.520]  compared to the universe it's but another life form an interface with humans and machines
[12:12.160 --> 12:18.480]  to interact with each other and through that giving rise to new algorithms of mathematical life
[12:18.480 --> 12:27.200]  and connecting humans in ways that we never would have imagined so any attempt to invert that
[12:27.200 --> 12:36.880]  against humanity is only going to break into a trillion pieces but that's a positive look
[12:36.880 --> 12:43.280]  the negative look back through the prism through the looking glass through the rainbow
[12:43.280 --> 12:49.360]  is that we've got the whole world's knowledge at our fingertips incredible things amazing
[12:49.360 --> 12:57.520]  photography art literature access to just unbelievable communication and we see IQs
[12:57.520 --> 13:03.200]  dropping physically we see brain activity lowering across the western world and as it's
[13:03.200 --> 13:07.520]  introduced to the third world precipitous drops as well following the exact same line
[13:07.520 --> 13:15.120]  we see a dull eyed spectator heartless soulless spirit descending
[13:17.680 --> 13:24.080]  because no one then appreciates the information anymore a book before the Gutenberg press would
[13:24.720 --> 13:34.160]  cost an average worker an entire lifetime's salary a book was more expensive than a mansion
[13:34.160 --> 13:44.560]  600 years ago a fully illustrated book it was power just 200 years later there were
[13:44.560 --> 13:51.200]  bookstores all over the developed world just brimming with books and and and hundreds of
[13:51.200 --> 13:57.120]  thousands of authors fighting to intellectually put their ideas out and just explosions of
[13:57.120 --> 14:01.920]  understanding and and art and literature and the Renaissance my god it's beautiful
[14:01.920 --> 14:05.120]  but out of that
[14:07.680 --> 14:13.680]  heart of freedom and beauty grew the military industrial complex grew all these other
[14:13.680 --> 14:21.040]  frauds that now are bigger and more dangerous than anything we've ever faced now i'm gonna
[14:21.040 --> 14:25.120]  get into all the news here today it's just that at the bottom of the hour i want to start more and
[14:25.120 --> 14:30.000]  more focusing on our ultimate destiny and having a debate about what that destiny is
[14:30.000 --> 14:35.120]  i will not tell you what i would like humanity's destiny to be because i'm still learning and
[14:35.120 --> 14:45.200]  seeing and marveling and just being blown away to be part of this time space continuum
[14:49.440 --> 14:57.440]  now coming up at the bottom of the hour rob do actually has it back there
[14:57.440 --> 15:04.240]  captured from nasa and hd years ago we have it it's also one of the backgrounds for here
[15:05.040 --> 15:12.400]  we're going to be playing some of the footage of the space station going around the earth and
[15:13.920 --> 15:18.000]  i'll be here basically narrating it for radio listeners and we've got this new footage i didn't
[15:18.000 --> 15:24.320]  get to yesterday um from astronauts with gopro cameras just some of the amazing footage there
[15:24.320 --> 15:30.880]  here just to get us to start thinking about looking outside the planet because we don't
[15:30.880 --> 15:36.240]  appreciate the planet we don't appreciate all the freedom we already have that's being taken away
[15:36.240 --> 15:42.880]  why don't we look outside the world to realize just how small we actually are and to get a feeling
[15:42.880 --> 15:48.160]  of the infiniteness of everything because within that it doesn't make you feel small it actually
[15:48.160 --> 15:55.920]  in my experience makes you feel big and we can tie into that zen timelessness that can bring
[15:55.920 --> 16:03.920]  us the deep strength that we need to transcend the global social engineers who on record wish
[16:03.920 --> 16:10.480]  to shutter the doors of perception and keep us dumbed down in a state of mindless
[16:10.480 --> 16:22.800]  frivolous medicalized tyranny focusing only on what they are feeding us
[16:22.800 --> 16:39.920]  now coming up i'll get into all the news it's just that this is a revolution of perception
[16:41.200 --> 16:45.440]  when you finally step back and don't even get into the whole debate about hillary
[16:45.440 --> 16:52.000]  she's disempowered she is a wicked evil corrupt political operative the worst of the worst
[16:52.000 --> 16:57.440]  when every indicator shows the american people the people of the world want true independence
[16:57.440 --> 17:03.360]  that are real and actually stand for something and who aren't bought and paid for by the big five
[17:03.360 --> 17:09.040]  megabags but everything hillary puts out is a lie within a line
[17:11.200 --> 17:18.240]  she claims that she's not with the one percent well that's a socialist social engineering
[17:18.240 --> 17:26.160]  class warfare term it's not one percent that are running things and creating monopolies
[17:26.160 --> 17:32.880]  it is the point zero zero zero zero zero zero zero what did come out to two three if you calculate
[17:32.880 --> 17:43.600]  six thousand people globally that have more than half the wealth then in almost every case
[17:43.600 --> 17:50.000]  you study how they got it they got it from inside deals or monopolies or scams or government contracts
[17:50.000 --> 17:57.280]  and then to a man and a woman almost all of them are funding 24 seven taking your property
[17:57.280 --> 18:05.360]  breaking up families forcibly inoculating taking your guns driverless cars it's this six thousand
[18:05.360 --> 18:12.080]  people that kisses your group wrote about in superclass that are the enemy they are the globalist
[18:12.080 --> 18:17.360]  they are the eugenicists they are the trash they are the problem they've already built up existing
[18:17.360 --> 18:22.960]  systems though to where if you remove them their underlings would step right into those positions
[18:22.960 --> 18:28.080]  because systems of fraud have been built in the last couple hundred years based on gaming and
[18:28.080 --> 18:32.960]  manipulating to where you couldn't just arrest all these people for treason and then give them
[18:32.960 --> 18:39.360]  jury trials and then have this stop because we've now had it hardwired into us where if you cut the
[18:39.360 --> 18:46.800]  tumors out there's you know the tumors half the liver the tumors one of the lungs the tumors part
[18:46.800 --> 18:52.000]  of the heart the tumors in the brain they've gotten all the pension funds all the economies all the
[18:52.000 --> 18:57.520]  systems based on government drug dealing based on money laundering based on all of it to where you
[18:57.520 --> 19:01.840]  can only survive being part of that in the system and then they selectively put you in one of their
[19:01.840 --> 19:06.800]  presence as slave labor when they catch you involved at the lower level of their own paradigm
[19:06.800 --> 19:13.600]  this is how you enslave people you create artificial ecosystems of economy you force people into it
[19:13.600 --> 19:19.920]  and then you strip their rights because of it coming up in the next segment mandatory vaccine
[19:19.920 --> 19:25.440]  bill passes hurdle in sacramento despite passionate protests it's going to the governor soon they
[19:25.440 --> 19:32.160]  said they've got the votes to have it leave the legislature and meanwhile i like him killing
[19:32.160 --> 19:39.440]  carbon taxes but boy is he a tyrant habit this is not our habit in texas but the leader of australia
[19:39.440 --> 19:44.080]  government withdraws child care payments from anti-vaccine parents and this is how i told you
[19:44.080 --> 19:51.200]  they'll come at us all over the world 35 years ago there were six vaccines on average now there's
[19:51.200 --> 19:56.480]  more than 50 they wanted to make it over a hundred they're killing us this is the takeover this is

[24:45.920 --> 24:52.560]  nothing in the world at exposing the larger global panopticonic takeover of the technocrats
[24:52.560 --> 24:59.040]  in their own words than this broadcast and i don't see myself as doing that good of a job that's
[24:59.040 --> 25:06.160]  what freaks me out if other folks slicker smarter more focused stood up sort of taking action
[25:06.160 --> 25:10.320]  who never thought of themselves in that role you would be leaders that were just amazing
[25:12.880 --> 25:17.040]  i'm like a little man compared to some of you that could be like Godzilla on the scene taking
[25:17.040 --> 25:23.200]  down the globalists and i need you to take action you might be hispanic you might be asian you might
[25:23.200 --> 25:28.320]  be white you might be black you might be who knows you're a human we are all together not in the
[25:28.320 --> 25:34.160]  socialist way but in a true human way fellow travelers we're brothers and sisters together
[25:34.160 --> 25:42.480]  in this epic crusade for the good guys to win people are ready to hear the truth but the world
[25:42.480 --> 25:53.040]  is so complex on the surface there's so many fake choices that the public doesn't really grasp why
[25:53.040 --> 25:59.360]  this is happening but it is organized i've read the books by curl quickly and this is a big new
[25:59.360 --> 26:13.040]  brzezinski and henry kissinger and david rockefeller and helmut schmitt and tony blair and prince philip
[26:13.040 --> 26:25.040]  and prince charles and roth cop and queen betricks and prince Bernhardt and adolf hitler and joseph
[26:25.040 --> 26:34.720]  stallin and vi lennon and marx and engels i've read hundreds and hundreds of their own books
[26:34.720 --> 26:42.640]  and writings my god it's horrible back when i had time i'd see some evil globalist quote i'd read
[26:42.640 --> 26:48.240]  what book it was supposedly in back before most books were scanned online and then i would send
[26:48.240 --> 26:52.160]  off for it i'd order it online or i'd go to the library and get it just to turn to that i remember
[26:52.160 --> 26:57.680]  here in rush limbaugh when i was in high school a high school senior first year he was on in austin
[26:57.680 --> 27:05.040]  for second year back when his show was a lot more hardcore and i heard him say gloria steinam is cia
[27:05.040 --> 27:11.760]  with leftist in the cia to destroy and enslave women and to get him out in the workforce to pay
[27:11.760 --> 27:17.040]  taxes he wouldn't say that today at least not that i hear when i have heard it it's just
[27:17.040 --> 27:23.600]  isn't the same person no offense i mean it's just true and then i went home and i thought
[27:23.600 --> 27:29.280]  i've seen that book and it was on the bookshelf my mother had bought it like five years before and i
[27:32.160 --> 27:34.240]  went to the back and and looked at the
[27:36.960 --> 27:42.400]  bibliography and there it was and there she was admitting it and it was stuff like that i
[27:42.400 --> 27:48.160]  would obsess on things to see if it was true let me think about that the modern feminist movement
[27:48.160 --> 27:58.240]  is cia to destroy the family this government is a foreign occupational enemy that runs the cia the
[27:58.240 --> 28:06.080]  1947 was a coup by basically globalist intelligence that already ran os s specter basically ran the
[28:06.080 --> 28:16.320]  os s their symbol is an octopus they just don't call it specter the globalist always
[28:16.320 --> 28:24.240]  describe themselves as an octopus or a hydra you're like wait a minute specter hydra all
[28:24.240 --> 28:30.720]  these movies yeah yeah they're criminal groups within institutions that's why they want bigger
[28:30.720 --> 28:36.640]  governments that's why they want power because through that these combines the 6 000 super
[28:36.640 --> 28:44.080]  class specter can do whatever they want and let me give you the news flash they financed hitler
[28:44.080 --> 28:51.280]  just got chills because they needed to have that opposition to make their eugenics take over
[28:51.280 --> 28:57.200]  there'd be more sophisticated look loving oh we don't wear scary black uniforms we're liberals
[28:57.200 --> 29:04.080]  oh look a black man a woman oh oh take your shot oh we won't let the races stop you from
[29:04.080 --> 29:10.400]  getting your abortion or your vaccines oh half the hispanics are about to there's already like 30
[29:10.400 --> 29:15.440]  percent of diabetes half of you're gonna have it oh you're getting you're dying oh we love you
[29:16.240 --> 29:22.320]  take your goddess little john we want the open borders so we can tax you and kill you i mean
[29:22.320 --> 29:29.840]  we love you but in the meantime you'll vote to do it and then see once you get the globalist
[29:29.840 --> 29:35.840]  perspective it's like oh my god you're not bored anymore you are in a fantastic science fiction
[29:35.840 --> 29:42.160]  movie and that's what i'm trying to get over to people is that it's epic it's epic it's epic
[29:42.160 --> 29:47.920]  it's epic we're on a planet in deep space run by scientific crazies that want to kill everybody

[33:46.160 --> 33:56.160]  the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit think about all the potentials for humanity
[33:56.160 --> 34:04.800]  and start thinking as a species as a human race and then all of these incredible triggers
[34:04.800 --> 34:11.200]  will be flipped in your mind in your gut in your soul and you will then see the mission laid out
[34:11.200 --> 34:19.920]  for you in god's plan specific to you now the globalists start at the end not at the beginning
[34:19.920 --> 34:25.520]  with that they say we're collectivist you must come together for humanity you must give up the
[34:25.520 --> 34:32.720]  needs of the individual or of the few for the many to quote the socialism from star trek and on
[34:32.720 --> 34:39.840]  the surface that rings true but not if it's centrally directed it always turns into a nightmare
[34:39.840 --> 34:48.000]  even if it was meant well only individualism then collectively coalescing in a destiny
[34:48.800 --> 34:52.960]  will build things that really work and are fantastic and phenomenal
[34:54.880 --> 35:03.520]  but there will always be haters who hate the magnificent civilization the systems that we
[35:03.520 --> 35:12.800]  build as little expressions of god made in god's image creators people say well that's just the
[35:12.800 --> 35:18.400]  bible i don't believe some 3000 year old old testament when you actually read the old testament
[35:18.400 --> 35:23.920]  every other ancient script basically says the same thing whether you believe it's an allegory
[35:23.920 --> 35:37.120]  a parable a composite of things that happened the point is that it's true when you break it all down
[35:41.360 --> 35:47.840]  and i sit back and i just marvel that the technocrats have been able to convince people from birth
[35:47.840 --> 35:55.200]  sitting in front of television sets with the false reality that they were projecting to accept it
[35:55.200 --> 36:04.560]  and give them their trust and i liken it to putting a worm on a hook the worm is juicy
[36:04.560 --> 36:12.800]  the worm is good the worm is nutritious the worm tastes wonderful to the fish but it's got a hook
[36:12.800 --> 36:19.920]  hidden inside of it but the line looks invisible in the water
[36:22.480 --> 36:28.320]  the creature the entity on the other end knows just how to make it look like it's a real worm
[36:28.320 --> 36:34.880]  going through the water or a real minnow and your desire for it makes you bite into that apple
[36:34.880 --> 36:44.160]  and now you're pulled up into a whole new level of atmosphere you're a fish out of water
[36:45.200 --> 36:52.240]  and that's what the globalists seek to do is build a proto matrix of televisions and smart
[36:52.240 --> 37:01.840]  grids and surveillance and entertainment and control as a mask as as a bag over your head
[37:01.840 --> 37:08.400]  but you never know it's a bag over your head as your ship to the global guantanamo as your soul
[37:08.400 --> 37:15.600]  is because from birth that hood is pulled down over your head and it's jacketed
[37:17.520 --> 37:23.680]  with tv screens they even actually have this now filament plastic that has a television screen
[37:23.680 --> 37:29.120]  on it projects images they've had that for decades but image it as a bag over your head
[37:29.120 --> 37:37.680]  with television images 3d virtual reality and whereas if you try to put something like that
[37:37.680 --> 37:41.680]  over your head i've never done it before you'll get nauseous you'll get sick you'll hate it but
[37:41.680 --> 37:50.080]  if you're born with a bag over your head you will adapt to it the globalists use our own adaptation
[37:50.080 --> 37:55.440]  against us that's what they do things slowly like binding a woman's feet when she's a little girl
[37:55.440 --> 38:02.000]  she thinks it's beautiful she thinks it's fashion she thinks it's cool it's really a social control
[38:02.000 --> 38:10.080]  used in africa asia and the americas by the meso americans to suppress the ruling class
[38:10.960 --> 38:15.680]  you can't feed yourself you've got to have footlong fingernails you can't be able to walk
[38:15.680 --> 38:21.280]  because you're a goddess and look how beautiful your little feet are the equivalent of a size
[38:21.280 --> 38:27.840]  two and a woman that should be a size eight deformed ugly gnarled feet of a beautiful young
[38:27.840 --> 38:32.560]  princess but that way the king didn't have a woman getting too uppity and in his face
[38:33.200 --> 38:38.480]  she can't even walk and when he wants to come in and have sex with her to procreate
[38:38.480 --> 38:46.880]  because she's the daughter of the last king he can but she can't come bother him when he's out
[38:46.880 --> 38:56.800]  hunting lions or tigers or elephants or jaguars and that's what feminism and all this modern
[38:56.800 --> 39:02.160]  garbage is is binding your feet or in africa they didn't want the ruling class women to get
[39:02.160 --> 39:06.960]  too uppity so they'd say it's so beautiful that you've got rings around your neck and they then
[39:06.960 --> 39:11.680]  have women with these footlong necks where they ever took the rings off they'd die they'd suffocate
[39:11.680 --> 39:18.640]  and the women couldn't even walk or run and so they just had to basically stay in the tent and
[39:18.640 --> 39:23.760]  shut up oh but it's so stylish can we pull up african women with rings around my neck please
[39:23.760 --> 39:29.360]  we pull up bound feet what they look like because when you understand this you understand everything
[39:30.160 --> 39:36.800]  and women still today do it women all over the world picked up this fashion in the last few
[39:36.800 --> 39:43.600]  hundred years to mimic the ruling class and all of their garbage
[39:46.560 --> 39:49.760]  my great-grandmother was a very beautiful woman but i remember going to the nursing home singer
[39:49.760 --> 39:56.160]  and heard to form feet from cramming them into those shoes just like women no diamonds or semi
[39:56.160 --> 40:01.520]  precious and her total garbage but they want you to spend a year's salary buying them a rock
[40:01.520 --> 40:06.960]  so they can show off to other women it's all trappings that didn't come from you
[40:08.320 --> 40:14.480]  it's all oppression and bars and chains and i want them off
[40:16.960 --> 40:21.760]  i'm here telling you how the magic trick works i'm here exposing it not because i'm special
[40:21.760 --> 40:27.520]  but because i am an animal thank god i don't mean an animal in that i'm not sentient and special
[40:27.520 --> 40:35.360]  and made by the creator i mean i've got my hard-wired caveman instincts and they see an enemy right
[40:35.360 --> 40:42.240]  away they see traps i'm the bass that sees the hook in the worm i'm the bass that doesn't take the
[40:42.240 --> 40:47.760]  bait or i took the bait when i was a kid got it ripped out of my mouth i got a scar to this day
[40:47.760 --> 40:52.960]  as i skewn the bottom i know i'm gonna look at something more than once before i bite into it
[40:52.960 --> 41:00.160]  and i swim over to another school of fish and i say i've been into that before they'll take you up
[41:00.160 --> 41:06.320]  to the top i got pulled up in the hot burning something and it was all blurry around me and
[41:06.320 --> 41:12.240]  it was painful but then it pulled out of my mouth and i'm just saying you don't want to bite into
[41:12.240 --> 41:20.160]  that but see bass can't talk they can only learn by instinct and experience and if that bass survives
[41:20.160 --> 41:30.240]  and is able to spawn and lay eggs or fertilize eggs genetically they've taken groups of wild bass
[41:30.880 --> 41:39.360]  and put them in tanks and 15 generations later bass know the silhouette of predator fish versus
[41:39.360 --> 41:43.920]  a silhouette of things that aren't predators they instinctively know the shape just like they've
[41:43.920 --> 41:52.560]  done 10 to 20 to 30 generations of chickens inside enclosed warehouse and they fly above them
[41:52.560 --> 41:58.320]  generations later the image of a triangle they're not scared the image of a circle they're not scared
[41:58.960 --> 42:04.960]  but the image of a hawk they all run like bloody murder to the coop they never saw a hawk
[42:04.960 --> 42:10.480]  they never saw anybody get killed by a hawk they never got told about a hawk they know
[42:10.480 --> 42:17.600]  they already had it you got it too the battle programming everything we need to crush this
[42:17.600 --> 42:23.280]  scum these people are nothing they want to take our programming and subvert it to bring us down
[42:23.280 --> 42:29.200]  no we're going up you bastards we're going all the way and you'll never stop us do you understand
[42:30.640 --> 42:35.600]  i hate your guts and i hate seeing you feed on innocent people i want to stomp your ass into
[42:35.600 --> 42:41.760]  the ground i want to crush you you chicken neck scum you filth you think i'm afraid of you you
[42:41.760 --> 42:47.840]  can do nothing to me and we're gonna get your ass you excuse me i'm not gonna get mad i'm gonna
[42:47.840 --> 42:52.720]  settle down i just start thinking about what they do to people all the little babies they've killed
[42:52.720 --> 42:57.520]  now they're using babies of genetic engineering and for food flavoring how they've degradated us
[42:57.520 --> 43:01.680]  and treated us like crap and tried to teach us that we're worthless we're not worthless
[43:01.680 --> 43:09.760]  you gotta see these people for the lion's scum that want to hurt you and your family
[43:09.760 --> 43:15.200]  let me tell you if you caught somebody breaking in your house and they got out of your house
[43:15.200 --> 43:19.680]  stay with your grandma's jewels it meant something to you or your dead wife's jewelry or whatever it
[43:19.680 --> 43:25.040]  was it was special or maybe a fish and rod your grandfather gave you whatever it is they stole
[43:25.040 --> 43:33.280]  and then one day you're at the pawn shop and you see somebody there trying to hawk your
[43:33.280 --> 43:38.560]  grandmother's ring would you get mad yeah but you wouldn't get mad if they put poison in the
[43:38.560 --> 43:43.920]  water on record to mutate our genetics and screw us up and lower our IQs i mean they're not just
[43:43.920 --> 43:49.120]  attacking one person they're attacking our very species like they are demon aliens or something
[43:49.120 --> 43:57.680]  okay let me tell you these people got a lot of will they hate you and that's why i'm not even
[43:57.680 --> 44:03.280]  going to sit here and debate this stuff with people anymore i mean do the do the do the college kids
[44:04.000 --> 44:08.720]  at media matters getting orders from the white house really think that 99% of you aren't going
[44:08.720 --> 44:13.520]  to get that white house job down the road that pays anything you're going to be hung out to dry
[44:13.520 --> 44:18.560]  you're not even going to get any power out of selling out and i mean i guarantee you got cousins
[44:18.560 --> 44:23.280]  that are dying at young ages you got neurological disorders in your family you can see everything
[44:23.280 --> 44:29.600]  i'm saying is true we're under attack why would you sit there and serve this oh because i get it
[44:30.800 --> 44:35.600]  because of gay rights you're all gay or something all you are is just the brainwashed group
[44:35.600 --> 44:40.000]  who's having something dangled in front of them because everything's being taken to tell you
[44:40.000 --> 44:45.120]  there's some new right out here or or or maybe you're a socialist you hate rich people you work for
[44:45.120 --> 44:50.400]  the richest people who want to destroy the ladder up for everybody else i mean it's so evil
[44:54.960 --> 45:01.280]  and it's so easy to break out of this if you just pull back and go what a joke and admit you were
[45:01.280 --> 45:06.560]  con admit it was all a lie and begin researching for yourself but see your subconscious mind has
[45:06.560 --> 45:12.240]  already been preconditioned these subliminals are admittedly there they're also over that you can't
[45:12.240 --> 45:20.160]  beat the new world order so your your your gut knows this is all true and again all your gut is as
[45:20.160 --> 45:25.040]  you're subconscious right through your spinal cord your intestines basically communicating to the
[45:25.040 --> 45:28.640]  rest of your endocrine system what's going on and so when you hear all the stuff and you're a new
[45:28.640 --> 45:32.240]  listener you want to laugh at it or get upset or say this guy's nuts it's because you're scared
[45:32.240 --> 45:36.000]  you don't think you're powerful you don't think you can change your environment because they fooled
[45:36.000 --> 45:42.080]  you to think that a hero has to defeat everybody by themselves that archetype that they falsely push
[45:42.080 --> 45:49.120]  of one guy defeats everybody that's not how it works one guy can start a chain reaction that
[45:49.120 --> 45:55.360]  defeats the globalist or there could be key players in that but the real power is just you
[45:55.360 --> 46:01.360]  becoming aware and admitting it to yourself and then it unlocks everything from that point and
[46:01.360 --> 46:06.480]  then you'll see opportunities to expose this paradigm but the biggest thing we can do is
[46:06.480 --> 46:10.720]  think about how beautiful and wondrous this planet is i just saw a photo last week was photo of the
[46:10.720 --> 46:16.240]  lake out there all over the place of the volcano with the lightning striking it i mean simply over
[46:16.240 --> 46:23.200]  the top beautiful that's the type of majestic stuff that i have personally seen one time i was
[46:25.920 --> 46:31.760]  out at the lake and there's been a thunderstorm and i saw triple rainbows but of course my iphone
[46:31.760 --> 46:40.160]  was dead it was one of the first iPhones that didn't charge well it was triple rainbows with huge
[46:40.160 --> 46:44.640]  black blue clouds with lightning shooting out and it looked like something out of a mild little pony
[46:46.240 --> 46:52.480]  video game or something it looks so fake it was so beautiful and the volcano i want guys is
[46:52.480 --> 46:56.960]  joe bigs a screensaver he brought it over a few weeks ago and i'd seen it in the news that's the
[46:56.960 --> 47:01.360]  one i want is this it's a still shot it's a 35 millimeter photo or maybe digital of the volcano
[47:01.360 --> 47:05.920]  and then the lightning striking it's just epic that's what i want to show but but regardless
[47:05.920 --> 47:10.880]  for tv viewers i mean the footage of the of the shuttle flying above the earth and the
[47:10.880 --> 47:16.880]  time lapse of the storms and the cities and the oceans and the the ports and and everything the
[47:17.840 --> 47:24.560]  the footage of the Saturn rockets and decoupling uh the footage of the gopros they released
[47:25.280 --> 47:30.480]  just a few days ago and then you mix into that all the horror and the garbage going on
[47:30.480 --> 47:36.000]  down here at the ground it made me think of all this when edgard d mitchell one of the
[47:36.000 --> 47:39.440]  astronauts that went to the moon and they did go to the moon folks people getting mad at me about
[47:39.440 --> 47:43.120]  that but they just didn't show you all the real stuff that got them there i have that from high
[47:43.120 --> 47:48.240]  level folks like raymond teague on record uh you develop an instant global consciousness starting
[47:48.240 --> 47:54.000]  up looking at the earth from the moon a people orientation an intense dissatisfaction with the
[47:54.000 --> 48:00.480]  state of the world and then compulsion to do something about it absolutely a compulsion it'd be
[48:00.480 --> 48:04.560]  an honor to be killed by the globalist or tortured i don't want that to happen my flesh is scared of
[48:04.560 --> 48:11.200]  it but not my guts not my soul man i'm like whatever i'm not afraid at all from out how
[48:11.200 --> 48:16.560]  i'm going to read the quote without granting you develop an instant global consciousness a people
[48:16.560 --> 48:21.760]  orientation an intense dissatisfaction with the state of the world and a compulsion to do something
[48:21.760 --> 48:26.800]  about it from out there on the moon international politics looks so petty you want to grab a
[48:26.800 --> 48:31.520]  politician with a screw up the neck and drag him a quarter of a mile a quarter of a million miles out
[48:31.520 --> 48:37.040]  and say look at that you son of a bitch make to talk like that but sometimes you got to just like
[48:37.040 --> 48:42.240]  the astronaut did look at that or let's say we didn't go to the moon you don't believe that look
[48:42.240 --> 48:47.760]  at the newborn baby look at the stars at night look at little fish down a pool and little crabs
[48:47.760 --> 48:55.360]  in an eddy pool you know on the west coast or or wales or the wind through the bamboo the sea
[48:56.560 --> 49:00.400]  just just look at your grandmother your grandfather think about all the people that
[49:00.400 --> 49:04.640]  taught you things just just all of it and your connection to all those people that come before
[49:04.640 --> 49:17.120]  you it's magic and then you look at time square and the globalist attempt to induct us into false
[49:17.120 --> 49:22.160]  realities to then teach us so people see aliens blowing up the planet they see thousands of
[49:22.160 --> 49:30.160]  murders a week simulated all these video games and then they can't differentiate the real epic
[49:30.160 --> 49:37.120]  things the real over the top huge things that are going on versus all the petty false stuff
[49:37.120 --> 49:43.120]  and the brain gets confused and then does it know what's a real threat what isn't a real threat
[49:43.120 --> 49:47.360]  yeah that's the photo right there the volcano and the lightning incredible we put that full screen if
[49:47.360 --> 49:56.880]  we can oh man look at that volcano starts erupting shooting up ash it causes static electricity and
[49:56.880 --> 50:03.440]  then boom lightning imagine the ancients seeing something like that in greaser in uh italy and
[50:03.440 --> 50:14.400]  and saying oh i saw vulcan up there with his hammer building weapons for the gods
[50:15.200 --> 50:19.600]  and even if that was just an archetypal vision they were having and those gods didn't exist
[50:19.600 --> 50:25.840]  it didn't matter because now look what we've risen to what we've built would be more fabulous
[50:25.840 --> 50:32.320]  than anything the gods of old humans could even dream and it's because we have such potential
[50:32.320 --> 50:38.880]  the enemy who seeks to be god with a big g wants to pull us down the children of god
[50:41.440 --> 50:45.120]  and these are the big secrets we need to transcend them we need to see how small they are
[50:45.120 --> 50:49.600]  what jokes they are and then have courage against them and not be afraid of being demonized or
[50:49.600 --> 50:54.720]  attacked because we have the light of the universe with us coming into the darkness

[54:20.640 --> 54:30.080]  reid and the occupational government homeland security hopes you don't remember or see and
[54:30.080 --> 54:41.040]  that's the feds aiming m4s and 308 rifles not just 223 at hundreds of peaceful people
[54:42.640 --> 54:49.680]  who marched in on their own land to free cows that were being allowed to die again they had range
[54:49.680 --> 54:56.800]  rides going back to 1877 they ran off 34 other families he was the 35th family he would not leave
[54:56.800 --> 55:03.040]  they raised the fees to a point you could not pay him the fees didn't start till the 60s and
[55:03.040 --> 55:07.680]  were very low and reasonable that's how it always starts just like i meant to talk about this if you
[55:07.680 --> 55:14.320]  watch television from the 40s and 50s it's all got very good pro america pro family messages
[55:14.320 --> 55:20.160]  people ask why that happened well the social engineers admit they made it very legitimate
[55:20.160 --> 55:26.960]  like the worm on the hook to look tasty to look good and then they began the social engineering
[55:26.960 --> 55:33.120]  to now it's nothing but what you would call deviance and by deviance they just want you
[55:33.120 --> 55:39.360]  to deviate from the normal human program so you never have rights of passage that activate memories
[55:39.360 --> 55:45.920]  that's what writes the passages when i was younger i hated ritual i'd say why are the cops of the
[55:45.920 --> 55:50.640]  fireman blocking the street for memorial why are people marching uh why you know a lot of people
[55:50.640 --> 55:59.600]  get into texas so much uh well it's because it's all we got and then at those times of ritual we've
[55:59.600 --> 56:05.040]  humans have done that so much that same way that that's why when you're there at a ritual you start
[56:05.040 --> 56:10.560]  having all these weird feelings and things because it's activating memories it's unlocking information
[56:11.200 --> 56:17.520]  and it turns out the elites all know this carl yung edward bernay sigmund Freud all of them
[56:18.400 --> 56:23.120]  but that's the real psychology they're using to control us not the pop psychology they give us
[56:23.120 --> 56:28.080]  where they're now announcing a mental illness if you're healthy and eat like a paleo diet and don't

[01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:54.080]  four to six p.m central central central you know darryl mcbreen made that a few months ago
[01:10:54.080 --> 01:11:00.000]  one of our great newsmen but also editors he's a journalist i think i hired him away from what
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.760]  was a script-powered news service he's a great editor and he put that together i thought it was
[01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:09.600]  one of the most epic things to overuse that word again but that is powerful over the top things he
[01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:17.520]  made and then we just put it the computer never played it so we'll air the entire thing coming
[01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:24.320]  up at the start of the next hour if you missed it because we also cut part of it out because of
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:31.760]  the break i'm going to air the crazy like alex jones 2.0 and the point in airing that was i was
[01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:39.440]  calling for the old one it's like five years old just the original song and they said oh you mean
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:45.040]  the new one and i went oh i forgot about that did we ever air that so that is coming up the
[01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:52.240]  start of the next hour and then we have an extremely powerful historical video that is the day the feds
[01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:58.400]  blinked uh the second shot heard around the world wasn't bullets but it was a shot of fear as the
[01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:03.200]  people stood up and rode up against feds with guns saying we will shoot you david knight was there
[01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:09.200]  marching at the head with his video camera with josh owens and i want to get both of these men in
[01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:16.480]  here i'd say 20 after next hour to talk a little bit before we air this video uh that rob dickinson
[01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:21.600]  just put together one year later because that's why harry reid came out and said these are terrorists
[01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:27.440]  you will pay you will fall well now he's fallen on his face literally and he's not running again
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:32.800]  and he now is acting like he's suddenly senile and i'm sad for folks when they start losing their
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:38.000]  mind but i'm not going to cry when harry reid drifts off into oblivion and his sons with all
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:42.400]  their chinese and globalist new world order insider contracts you know i'm still they'll
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:48.480]  still do fine stealing people's property in my view so that's coming up today this is the one
[01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:55.920]  year anniversary of the april 13th event now remember the globalist loved to blow stuff up
[01:12:55.920 --> 01:13:00.560]  and burn down churches and bomb federal buildings and things like that on april 19th or april 20th
[01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:05.440]  that was their way of staging the boston bombing to blame the patriots and it went sideways so they
[01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:10.560]  changed the story to his llamasist and burned some infiltrators young infiltrators they'd hired
[01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:15.360]  pretty sick how they did that speaking of burning young infiltrators
[01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:22.160]  i'm going to get uh coming up at the bottom of the hour into a story out of the houston chronicle
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:32.480]  and that deals with uh the police officer who was cop of the year and i had it here in my
[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:38.000]  stack guys printed against i can't find a thanks cop of the year got caught trying to sell five
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:46.960]  kilos of cocaine supposedly now the houston police department is so scary probably one of the most
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:53.040]  scary police departments in the country so infiltrated with hitmen and cia and you name it
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:59.120]  because they're down on the border i mean i've got so much intel houston police department that i
[01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:04.960]  bet you a lot of money that this cop of the year wasn't paying his cut up above him made the cia mad
[01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:09.120]  asked for more money like noriega did houston police officers face up alive in prison over drug
[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:18.000]  charges and he was cop of the year cop of the year in houston one of the biggest police departments
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:24.400]  in the country supposedly he got busted by the the drug enforcement agency along with the fbi and
[01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:36.160]  the houston pd trying to sell five kilos of cocaine the dea it came out in congress in 97 with the
[01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:42.880]  inspector general of the cia it's been all over the news since the 60s it's a fact that the drug
[01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:49.680]  importation agency better known as the drug enforcement agency that the drug importation
[01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:57.840]  agency brings in more drugs in the cia the cia just kind of oversees it i mean the dea is the most
[01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:04.720]  criminal organization they're worse than the atf now there are de agents that actually
[01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:10.480]  fight real drug dealers but they're compartmentalized it came out three years ago in the uh
[01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:16.400]  chicago tribune that they had the number two of los at us and he walked into court and in in in
[01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:21.600]  english said i'm cia trained u.s. military trained here trained there you're trained at school in
[01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:27.600]  america's uh blah blah blah uh codename and and and the lawyers get up the feds go shut this down
[01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:33.840]  and went behind closed doors judge comes out goes release him he's a u.s. agent he comes in and goes

[01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:47.840]  07543 and they're like whoa whoa whoa shut it down i mean that's all any of this ish and i'm just
[01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:59.200]  tired of it i mean you look at the mexican drug cartels of the five big cartels three of them it
[01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:08.560]  was two of them are run out of the pentagon and i know folks i'm just gonna leave it at that that
[01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:14.000]  are in the regular army who went down to mexico to supposedly fight drugs and and and basically resigned
[01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:19.840]  and so they wouldn't be part of it and they wouldn't tell me but they just said look it's
[01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:23.920]  everything you talk about i don't need to tell you what it was it's secret i'm not gonna tell you but
[01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:32.800]  you already know and they've got those euro copters they have the back that comes down
[01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:39.360]  just squadrons of them i mean it's just full on war u.s. troops dying marines army they've
[01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:44.960]  got air force intelligence involved i mean it's just unbelievable grid spraying the fields they
[01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:53.760]  don't own a marijuana i mean it is just full out just like in columbia it's even in roiders that
[01:16:54.320 --> 01:17:00.320]  we don't spray the good coca growers we spray the communist ones and know where there's are
[01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:04.160]  and then our buddies are gps coordinated where they don't spray those
[01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:13.600]  and the argument is well we've got to control the drugs or bad guys look at the money from it
[01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:18.640]  same thing in afghanistan this is how corrupt the system is and we need to stop being like children
[01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:31.280]  we need to stop it and and i'm not here endorsing the drug culture
[01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:38.480]  but the filthy drug culture came out of making the drugs illegal so yeah you got unsavory people
[01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:43.120]  involved in drugs and i don't think they should be legalized they should be decriminalized
[01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:49.120]  and it should be treated as a disease europe has done this in most areas and their crime
[01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:55.040]  rage you can pull it up has dropped over half and they just put up billboard saying not cool just
[01:17:55.040 --> 01:18:01.520]  pathetic showing you know a woman all skinny with tracks all over her arms just like putting
[01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:06.480]  someone on a respirator on cigarette packs it's the same deal nicotine is more addictive than
[01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:11.920]  cocaine it hits the same receptors in the brain do we arrest people for that no we don't
[01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:17.520]  don't is smoking good no is using heroin good no is using cocaine good no
[01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:28.480]  but it has to be decriminalized there's their spiegel it's working portugal 12 years after
[01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:33.840]  decriminalizing drugs and then their spiegel investigation shows a massive drop in crime
[01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:38.000]  i remember reading an article years ago is that the one where it said 50 percent i mean i've read
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:44.400]  countless articles but how far does it say it dropped their their their violent crime everything
[01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:48.480]  and there's a map there showing crime going on all over the world the point is
[01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:53.440]  is that they know what they're doing and then now the cops want to asset forfeiture
[01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:58.640]  seize your car if you're speeding too fast or or there have been cases where a guy pulls over
[01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:02.480]  and whistles at a hot chick and says get in let's go have a good time and she says you gonna buy me
[01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:10.640]  dinner we're gonna have fun yeah boom handcuffs and who and if she was a prostitute the point is we
[01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:15.360]  got government raping everybody of their money we got dinecore and others caught running child
[01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:19.680]  kidnapping range i tell you what after you've arrested all the big bankers for laundering the
[01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:24.080]  money and after you've you know done all this then you can keep drugs illegal if you do that
[01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:28.400]  you know what if you do like singapore where really nobody's on drugs they made the decision to sing
[01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:32.560]  and pour in other areas to just not have it and they execute you if you're caught with it and there
[01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:37.920]  is no drugs there let's see the government's not involved and they made the decision to not want
[01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:42.400]  to be conquered by drug dealing because that's how the british took over uh china and broke it in 12
[01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:47.200]  or 14 parts depending on what era was they china made drugs illegal but then they shipped them in
[01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:51.280]  and got them past them and then over the next 50 years corrupt the country took it over so you
[01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:56.720]  either you either have zero drugs or you legalize them all you don't have it either way you either
[01:19:56.720 --> 01:20:00.720]  execute people for smoking pot or you legalize it you criminalize it from the producers of the

[01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:44.880]  smugglers they might be no that's it the fbi is there and then of course all you gotta do is follow

[01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:54.240]  are either of course we got the secret documents and others from insiders in seattle and it was

[01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:49.600]  up by bush's ranch it was new of 20 miles from there but we went up there and they burned the
[01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:53.840]  fields it was on the news they had helicopters land people described it they said it was like a
[01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:58.160]  close encounters the third kind or something because you know all the army guys and everything
[01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:04.560]  something somebody decided you the government authorized hiv to be planted and it's hiv virus
[01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:11.040]  and then i went on coast to coast am it wasn't george norrie because you know george would just
[01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:15.280]  look up what i said it was another host and the host wasn't mean but he starts freaking out and he
[01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:19.280]  goes now come on this is like years after he'd been the news he goes that's not true they don't
[01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:24.480]  have pharmacological crops where you know the crop has live this is about i said no they've got them
[01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:30.320]  that produce whatever they want you can program a plant especially corn to basically grow human
[01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:36.480]  blood cells in it almost i mean it's just that it's that advanced and uh then he went oh my god if
[01:35:36.480 --> 01:35:42.080]  about an hour somebody sent him a link to it and i said i told you i mean i'm not crazy i'm not i'm
[01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:50.000]  nobody i mean i i know about pharmacological crops i've told this story probably 60 70 times i'll
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:56.400]  tell it again i know right when it happened because my wife was pregnant with our first child so it was
[01:35:56.400 --> 01:36:00.880]  12 years ago and i went into konan's pizza down the street and i know because the guy got in my face
[01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:11.040]  so much that i was mad i'm going to that part of story there's just nothing to be ashamed of but it
[01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:15.840]  says how greedy i am i ordered one pizza for her but i knew that she wasn't home yet she won one
[01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:20.320]  and then i ordered a little one and ate it and played video games and drank some beers and i was
[01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:26.480]  so mad i bit into the fort and cracked his tooth but but i'm kind of flashing back to uh to what
[01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:32.720]  happened there and this guy comes up and he pokes me in the back and i'm up there ordering a piece
[01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:36.800]  of her and i was like what's going on because man i used to really like cubes you're a liar
[01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:44.320]  it's all such thing as goats that are part spider and this is like 2002 and i go um i was like yeah

[01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:14.080]  and the guy's like whatever classic bully backed off as soon as you go whatever man i just
[01:37:14.080 --> 01:37:18.880]  really used to believe in you and you lie about that he was i have a degree in biology from ut and
[01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:24.000]  there's no such thing and i went when is it from 1977 he was yeah yeah it's around there
[01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:29.520]  and i went well dude we ain't in Kansas anymore that's the exact words you know how much i say that
[01:37:29.520 --> 01:37:37.760]  i perseverated and then i brushed past him went over sat down got mad cracked my tooth

[01:37:57.440 --> 01:38:02.240]  guts and you know that's why i get up here and i say chicago tribune reported that the number two
[01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:07.760]  in los zetas was really army cia and he was let off when he declared national security by the judge
[01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:13.280]  people like oh he shut up you liar don't like our military i know i like keeping our military not
[01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:17.760]  criminal they play all these games i was thinking about that last night
[01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:28.320]  that i have to get up here and explain that i'm not against our military when i say we don't need
[01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:33.040]  the military training for gun confiscation the military doesn't want to gun confiscate it's un
[01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:38.800]  constitutional it's illegal it'll start a civil war but that's what the army puts out in press
[01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:43.760]  releases they've been putting out that we're anti-military well you know i haven't made a big deal
[01:38:43.760 --> 01:38:48.880]  out of this we probably need to on the nightly news or with an article they didn't want us in this
[01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:56.080]  dirty bomb exercise that joe biggs wanted to go to i said don't go to that anyways once the once
[01:38:56.080 --> 01:39:01.440]  they already said we're not welcome because i said it's on base and it's off a base and they'll
[01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:05.760]  just change it if you come and they're always doing stunts where they'll have some legitimate
[01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:09.840]  dirty bomb drill to make what they're doing look legitimate when the real stuff goes on behind the
[01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:15.360]  scenes well i was wrong but it turns out listeners got the footage they were training for riot
[01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:20.080]  control and rounding up and arresting people so it looks like with all these exercises almost all
[01:39:20.080 --> 01:39:24.560]  of them are now not even the cover story they just put that out in the news then you go there and
[01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:32.320]  there's not a dirty bomb exercise that we have it or saw it's it's a it's a it's a roundup exercise
[01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:37.600]  so i don't know you know i want to go to your phone calls i'm kind of wound up today i haven't

[01:45:41.680 --> 01:45:49.360]  months and then is it better or worse than you thought it would be there was one day i was here

[01:47:54.000 --> 01:48:00.320]  to announce anti-vaccine parents will lose benefits so there's that news meanwhile pioneering
[01:48:00.320 --> 01:48:08.720]  trials using man-made dna begin in battle against cancer Ebola flu and hiv with scientists saying
[01:48:08.720 --> 01:48:14.720]  the treatment could be the key to defeating them that's why they want to grow the dna or the RNA
[01:48:14.720 --> 01:48:18.960]  of hiv and corn to then inject it into them and they admit that here fun that's why i thought of
[01:48:18.960 --> 01:48:25.200]  that today it's back in the news today this is what the daily mail pioneering new treatments
[01:48:25.760 --> 01:48:30.480]  experts have worked out how to create strands of artificial dna each mimicking a different killer
[01:48:30.480 --> 01:48:34.800]  disease oh how nice and injecting them into patients the idea is the new patients immune
[01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:39.840]  systems will then be able to recognize the threats and eliminate them of course this you know the
[01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:45.040]  the the original polio shot they admit gave over a hundred million americans cancer look it up and
[01:48:45.040 --> 01:48:49.440]  that bunch of them died from it tens of millions but hey it's a side effect that killed more people
[01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:54.480]  than the polio but doesn't matter it's your government trying to put something in you think
[01:48:54.480 --> 01:49:04.080]  about that one of the companies behind the technique has begun trials in ovio in humans after
[01:49:04.080 --> 01:49:10.000]  strong lab results the american company is using the method to attack flu abola and certain types
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:16.880]  of cancer as well as hiv and her or hepatitis experts have already started trials on female
[01:49:16.880 --> 01:49:22.480]  patients to see if they can stop them developing cervical cancer of course then they can also
[01:49:22.480 --> 01:49:26.320]  give you cancer with this stuff and in god knows what else will happen i mean it's just a pandora's

[02:16:50.720 --> 02:16:57.920]  brain anyway let me get in tinfoil hat mode so i can talk to you basically the reason why i support
[02:16:57.920 --> 02:17:03.200]  hillary clinton is because before bill clinton here's the peace and prosperity we've got barack
[02:17:03.200 --> 02:17:09.280]  obama he started things and he's got the ball rolling we are so close to equality in this nation
[02:17:09.280 --> 02:17:13.520]  and all you want to do is just sit there and say socialism socialism is going to deteriorate into
[02:17:13.520 --> 02:17:20.000]  communism actually no let me do it let me do it the right way here's alex jones i got 55 arms i

[02:17:29.360 --> 02:17:35.680]  yeah exactly precisely but actually you should be saying i hate gay i hate black because that's
[02:17:35.680 --> 02:17:40.000]  what the thoughts that are so you agree with david cross's movie where it ends with them saying
[02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:45.440]  i hate everybody i'm alex jones i'm racist it's just it's true because you said it i've never seen
[02:17:45.440 --> 02:17:50.960]  that movie sir well i played a clip i watched all right i mean the point here is you're saying the
[02:17:50.960 --> 02:17:56.560]  same thing though okay well i mean ask me a question what do you want to know i told you
[02:17:56.560 --> 02:18:01.280]  hillary is going to bring unity there's nothing that you can do to stop it and i can't wait to
[02:18:01.280 --> 02:18:07.200]  see all your little tinfoil hat legions has exploded when it happened i was driving today
[02:18:07.200 --> 02:18:12.160]  and i saw somebody with an info wars bumper sticker so i drove up alongside of them
[02:18:13.200 --> 02:18:19.520]  and i was actually surprisingly it wasn't a big old monster truck you know driving all crazy and
[02:18:19.520 --> 02:18:25.120]  flipping people off like a crazed lunatic from a trailer park and it was a black man sitting in
[02:18:25.120 --> 02:18:31.680]  there i mean talk about a joke that's like i just i couldn't even believe it you're trying to tell me
[02:18:31.680 --> 02:18:36.800]  that there would actually be a black person who would listen to alex jones what a joke oh my gosh
[02:18:36.800 --> 02:18:41.840]  okay we're going to skip this network breaking up callers more time i think you're serious and i think

[02:18:47.120 --> 02:18:50.640]  of black people never being born in this country you think i'm racist because i'm not for killing

[02:19:17.920 --> 02:19:22.880]  supported in new york city you know it's no no no no well listen let's just say it's 20
[02:19:22.880 --> 02:19:27.040]  percent which we all know it's over 50 is there a targeting of blacks with abortion
[02:19:27.040 --> 02:19:35.040]  no they absolutely not just because the the thing is is that you're this is a course and
[02:19:35.040 --> 02:19:40.480]  courage the reason why there are abortion clinics in urban areas is because those are the most
[02:19:40.480 --> 02:19:45.520]  crowded those are the most impoverished and those are the people who need access the most you don't
[02:19:45.520 --> 02:19:51.520]  need abortion clinics in the suburbs where all the right wing lunatics live you need them in
[02:19:51.520 --> 02:19:56.160]  the city where people understand that this population is you know overcrowded and we're
[02:19:56.160 --> 02:20:01.440]  going to destroy the earth if we don't reverse what climate change soon also you're a denialist
[02:20:01.440 --> 02:20:08.240]  and a truth earth and we'll never let me give you the numbers so in 2012's last numbers we have
[02:20:08.240 --> 02:20:14.720]  there were black more black babies killed in abortion 31 328 new york city then we're born
[02:20:14.720 --> 02:20:23.600]  there 24 758 so i think that's more like 55 percent uh and the black children killed comprised 42.4
[02:20:23.600 --> 02:20:28.320]  percent of the total number blacks are 30 percent of the population and there were 42 percent so
[02:20:28.320 --> 02:20:35.600]  there you go okay so again back to my point so the answer isn't make these communities better
[02:20:35.600 --> 02:20:39.600]  and everything the answer is just don't have black people around that's because we love them no
[02:20:39.600 --> 02:20:45.600]  it's it you're you're going off on a racist tyrant you claim to be this great unifier who wants
[02:20:45.600 --> 02:20:51.600]  you know equality for all and then you say black babies are getting black baby no what you are is
[02:20:51.600 --> 02:20:56.560]  you're against anybody with a southern or western accent and you think again so do you want me to
[02:20:56.560 --> 02:21:03.680]  speak with this accent for you does that make me sound more intellectual actually yes it does
[02:21:03.680 --> 02:21:10.640]  to be honest with you all right well i appreciate your call then smithy did you give us your number
[02:21:10.640 --> 02:21:16.240]  can we start having you on i'd like to have you on the video skype so that we might get an extra
[02:21:16.240 --> 02:21:23.440]  depth to your incredible repertoire of intellectual acumen you have quite a armory of information
[02:21:23.440 --> 02:21:31.280]  that actually has a shrinking in fear from your incredible gravitas would you grace us with your
[02:21:31.280 --> 02:21:39.600]  routine present mr jones i would be more than happy to show up anytime on your show and show
[02:21:39.600 --> 02:21:46.800]  mainstream america and show all the tinfoil hat loving trailer park trashed exactly what is reality
[02:21:46.800 --> 02:21:50.640]  because you have this false idea this is the vibe congress though you hate people in the south
[02:21:50.640 --> 02:21:54.240]  you hate folks that live in trailers even though it's the best housing they can get you sit up
[02:21:54.240 --> 02:21:57.680]  there on your elitist high horse you talk about how you've been to college you know i know i'm
[02:21:57.680 --> 02:22:03.200]  because i never even grace the halls which isn't even true i was like a brainwashing camp i thought
[02:22:03.200 --> 02:22:08.000]  i was in the middle of red dawn reeducation center i mean i mean i mean almost my entire family
[02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:14.160]  are super successful smart you sit up there and just say i'm no one because i have a texas accent
[02:22:14.160 --> 02:22:18.320]  and i'm very proud of i mean is there a reason most of top newscasters like dan rather and people
[02:22:18.320 --> 02:22:22.960]  come from texas to treat this per capita texas i don't care what color they are aren't some of the
[02:22:22.960 --> 02:22:28.560]  most successful people worldwide and are sought after for executive positions across the planet
[02:22:28.560 --> 02:22:34.000]  and why do you think that is because we're good hardworking loving smart people and you are an
[02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:41.120]  elitist wannabe i mean it's it's ridiculous smithy so did you give us your number absolutely i did

[02:24:40.080 --> 02:24:44.880]  no but i have a hillary clinton story a real life story i want to pass on because those are the
[02:24:44.880 --> 02:24:50.240]  best when she was first lady uh she had just come back from red china and i heard she was going to
[02:24:50.240 --> 02:24:56.080]  danville so i went up there to danville and i had a scripture sign that be sure your sin will
[02:24:56.080 --> 02:25:02.000]  find you out so as she was going around shaking the children's hands celebrating the year of the
[02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:07.200]  woman in red china can you believe that that's what it was called well no matter if you enslave
[02:25:07.200 --> 02:25:12.240]  women and make them have forced abortions as long as you say it's for women see you aren't for aborting
[02:25:12.240 --> 02:25:18.080]  chinese women because you're anti-woman see hillary represents women you don't keep your mouth shut
[02:25:18.080 --> 02:25:21.360]  learn to worship her hater sorry go ahead i'm just agreeing with smithy
[02:25:23.360 --> 02:25:28.240]  so i stuck it right in her face and it said in numbers uh i forgot the verse but it said be
[02:25:28.240 --> 02:25:34.400]  sure your son will find you out she ignored me and we were like 10 feet 15 feet away and so
[02:25:35.120 --> 02:25:40.800]  uh because she remained silent didn't engage in argument i got outside where she got in her car
[02:25:40.800 --> 02:25:45.040]  and made a left turn out of the driveway and again i stuck it up in the air this is right in the
[02:25:45.040 --> 02:25:50.240]  days when cell phones were starting to become popular and she was on her cell phone in her left
[02:25:50.240 --> 02:25:54.880]  hand and she turned to her left immediately after she read the verse you know so she didn't have to
[02:25:54.880 --> 02:26:02.400]  read it and that's the fact jack but i'm headed up to sacramento lord willing to talk with the
[02:26:02.400 --> 02:26:06.800]  governor which is a long shot i probably won't get to do that on the vaccination thing what's
[02:26:06.800 --> 02:26:12.800]  suggestion would you have for me to try and uh you know influence the legislature is there a
[02:26:12.800 --> 02:26:17.760]  possibility of that happening from regular folks such as your listeners what trying to stop the
[02:26:17.760 --> 02:26:23.760]  force inoculation yes absolutely put incredible pressure on them and point out and get the news
[02:26:23.760 --> 02:26:28.640]  to cover what's in the inserts uh and the fact that this is tyrannical god bless you appreciate
[02:26:28.640 --> 02:26:35.280]  your call uh do we got anybody really supporting hillary they're all sarcastic let's talk to
[02:26:35.280 --> 02:26:41.040]  collin our brasska uh you're on the air do you support uh i guess lord and savior part two
[02:26:41.040 --> 02:26:44.080]  because that's what jamie fox actually we have the clip of jamie fox let's play this first
[02:26:44.080 --> 02:26:48.720]  because they say hillary will run on obama's same platform same race baby this time it'll be you
[02:26:48.720 --> 02:26:53.040]  don't like women we just heard that talking point earlier now let's play that clip first of all
[02:26:53.040 --> 02:27:12.560]  give an honor to god and our lord and savior for rock obama yeah word but right he actually
[02:27:12.560 --> 02:27:18.400]  makes me like obama's like yeah but rock obama baby who gonna screw us over
[02:27:18.400 --> 02:27:27.520]  over sorry kyle go ahead and brasska apologize so if you could just give me a full 50 seconds
[02:27:27.520 --> 02:27:33.440]  and then you can go ahead and rebut after um our lordship hillary clinton is running for
[02:27:33.440 --> 02:27:39.760]  office she's going for equality and she's going for thinking you know people like qaddafi out
[02:27:39.760 --> 02:27:44.800]  who are going against terrorists and having a rise up of islamic militants in that area and
[02:27:44.800 --> 02:27:50.320]  she's for uh having 30 rebels and several illegal immigrants coming into our country so we can
[02:27:50.320 --> 02:27:56.320]  balance out the equality of americans versus illegals whom of which could be terrorists
[02:27:56.320 --> 02:28:01.840]  and she's of course putting up you know her principles from monsanto her backing for her
[02:28:01.840 --> 02:28:08.560]  lordship and without these things we cannot balance the good with the evil and well that's
[02:28:08.560 --> 02:28:13.360]  right i mean that's exactly what the last caller said white sir evil and a real problem genocide
[02:28:13.360 --> 02:28:18.560]  them even though he was white uh don't have kids you know because he's obviously gay uh which is
[02:28:18.560 --> 02:28:23.120]  that's his issue but then it comes with the anti-gun anti-family i have to be exterminated
[02:28:23.120 --> 02:28:26.800]  by him i can only survive if i agree to be with a guy and not have children
[02:28:26.800 --> 02:28:32.160]  literally turn my guns in and he goes we will have a quality he means they're going to conquer me
[02:28:32.160 --> 02:28:37.440]  and conquer you by bringing in the voting block that's checkmate and they know it battleground
[02:28:37.440 --> 02:28:41.440]  tech has been caught on video going yeah look at that stupid cripple running for gatherer he's
[02:28:41.440 --> 02:28:46.400]  gonna lose we're gonna bring in so many illegals nobody can stop us it sounds just like the wicked
[02:28:46.400 --> 02:28:52.000]  witch man and these people know what they're doing they're sick freaks go ahead there'll be too many
[02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:57.200]  illegals in the country to go against the trying to legalize the immigrants that's why the republicans
[02:28:57.200 --> 02:29:03.280]  cannot go again they want the same thing they're globalist i mean you know they want the cheap
[02:29:03.280 --> 02:29:07.120]  labor drop down wages but for the democrats and the democrats are a mentally ill group
[02:29:07.120 --> 02:29:13.360]  and uh i mean we're just we're in trouble and i mean listen this is how they bring countries down
[02:29:13.360 --> 02:29:18.720]  folks they're doing it right now i mean it's we have failed mexico and guatemala just
[02:29:19.760 --> 02:29:25.680]  disgorging everybody people who know jobs welfare people that are crippled uh you name it and just
[02:29:25.680 --> 02:29:29.280]  pay for it pay for it but then if an old lady can't pay her taxes they come and take her house
[02:29:29.280 --> 02:29:33.840]  it's like how about you okay don't take the old lady's houses stop all the repossessions and all
[02:29:33.840 --> 02:29:38.640]  that then we'll bring the illegals up here oh no no no if you're an american i don't care what color

[02:34:53.600 --> 02:34:57.760]  wars live dot com we've got a few minutes before we air this and we'll come back get some final
[02:34:57.760 --> 02:35:04.480]  comments from josh owens and david night who one year ago today at about this time we're leading
[02:35:04.480 --> 02:35:08.720]  with a march as journalists the fed saying we're going to shoot you at the bundy ranch over a
[02:35:08.720 --> 02:35:16.160]  million views on that video they got out that night uh just historic event feds surrender to
[02:35:16.160 --> 02:35:22.400]  citizens feds forces surrendered american citizens the name of the videos right at 1.5 million views
[02:35:23.120 --> 02:35:27.600]  tens of millions of views in the aggregate and here on this show the point is it's getting out there
[02:35:27.600 --> 02:35:31.760]  harry reid freaked out call everybody terrorist but he's the one who's fallen on his face now
[02:35:31.760 --> 02:35:36.320]  he's the one leaving office now and it really shows where things are going to go in the future
[02:35:36.320 --> 02:35:40.960]  when we have the moral authority if they really want this civil war uh david night a minute or two
[02:35:40.960 --> 02:35:45.920]  comment and then josh owens you guys really were and everybody they're heroes of something very
[02:35:45.920 --> 02:35:51.600]  important this was the second shot heard around the world but not redcoats firing redcoats standing
[02:35:51.600 --> 02:35:57.200]  down exactly alex you know is great that we were there but i think both of us were very upset to
[02:35:57.200 --> 02:36:02.560]  see how it was spin how the spin that came out the media the spin that came out of harry reid
[02:36:03.440 --> 02:36:07.520]  we saw the people there we know that they were not threatening the troops it was the troops
[02:36:07.520 --> 02:36:10.720]  that were pointing guns at people the troops that were shot you heard them they said we'll shoot you
[02:36:10.720 --> 02:36:15.280]  you heard exactly and as we point out in this video you can see the fox news guy thought he's
[02:36:15.280 --> 02:36:19.440]  going to be shot as well he's holding his camera but he's lifting up his shirt saying don't shoot
[02:36:19.440 --> 02:36:23.520]  don't shoot you know so i mean there's plenty of evidence you can see it there you can also see
[02:36:23.520 --> 02:36:28.400]  the people are not pointing guns most of people there didn't have any they had one guy overpassed
[02:36:28.400 --> 02:36:33.040]  it was really suspicious with us all they showed the entire very provocative very stupid exactly
[02:36:33.040 --> 02:36:37.600]  it's like the feds pointing guns very provocative very stupid yeah absolutely but it's very key and
[02:36:37.600 --> 02:36:41.760]  of course they had a party this last saturday it took place on a saturday they had a big barbecue
[02:36:41.760 --> 02:36:47.120]  so you see uh salon coming out saying this is what white supremacy looks like the bundy ranch
[02:36:47.120 --> 02:36:52.400]  has a party when you're after the fact because the feds stood down but meanwhile in uh charleston
[02:36:52.400 --> 02:36:56.960]  they're shooting a black man in the back so they make it racial this is nothing but that cop's been
[02:36:56.960 --> 02:37:01.680]  indicted absolutely absolutely and we talk about we got we got black cops shooting black guys and
[02:37:01.680 --> 02:37:05.760]  vice versa and white cops beating up white guys and shooting them i mean it's just there's an out of
[02:37:05.760 --> 02:37:10.320]  control police culture in some areas but it's not racial in my view absolutely and they also
[02:37:10.320 --> 02:37:16.000]  take the southern poverty law center attack and they try to to connect in jared miller the guy who
[02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:21.520]  later a couple of months later shot a couple of cops in las vegas making it look as if he was there
[02:37:21.520 --> 02:37:27.760]  you know this was part of the the bundy revolution and of course it wasn't they ejected him out of
[02:37:27.760 --> 02:37:31.440]  their midst and that's one of the points i make in the video is that unlike ferguson where you had
[02:37:31.440 --> 02:37:37.280]  outside provocateurs come in looting and burning buildings they had their own people there that
[02:37:37.280 --> 02:37:41.120]  we're gonna break this down after the video with some final comments but josh we got about a minute
[02:37:41.120 --> 02:37:45.200]  till we got to go to this video uh what's your take one year later well i can't believe it's
[02:37:45.200 --> 02:37:49.120]  it's been a year and time flies but like he was saying i mean even with the jared miller stuff
[02:37:49.120 --> 02:37:52.640]  remember when that came out when when that happened when they were draping the bodies and gats and
[02:37:52.640 --> 02:37:57.040]  flags i went back and looked at my footage and i went through and all of the militiamen all the
[02:37:57.040 --> 02:38:01.040]  people that were there i got video of every single one of them and they weren't there but they tried
[02:38:01.040 --> 02:38:04.720]  to act like they were there they tried to act like they were almost like they were leading it like
[02:38:04.720 --> 02:38:09.520]  look at what these people did at bundy ranch no people didn't die that day but look what they did
[02:38:09.520 --> 02:38:14.720]  you know however long after when jared miller and amanda they gave an interview to somebody that
[02:38:14.720 --> 02:38:18.720]  was there but they got him out of their midst that's the key thing and they were actually
[02:38:18.720 --> 02:38:22.960]  better at policing if you want to say this is a straight up shot with this guy they got him out
[02:38:22.960 --> 02:38:27.040]  of the area look i think the whole thing was suspicious and we're going to break that down
[02:38:27.040 --> 02:38:30.320]  that's the folks that went in the walmart and shot the cop yeah yeah and then one other
[02:38:30.880 --> 02:38:35.040]  you want to say that he really was somebody looking to shoot cops and he wasn't uh patsey or
[02:38:35.040 --> 02:38:38.480]  or part of it then they we're going to break that down we're going to the video right now here's a
[02:38:38.480 --> 02:38:49.760]  special report
[02:38:49.760 --> 02:38:54.160]  sheriff this is what we the people are asking this morning
[02:38:56.080 --> 02:38:58.960]  dis disarm the park service
[02:39:00.800 --> 02:39:04.160]  we're faced with the decision to either get the cattle or be the cattle
[02:39:04.160 --> 02:39:10.000]  but we're staying here until they're done we want those arms picked up the way
[02:39:11.440 --> 02:39:16.400]  rad is now moving forward toward the barrier the police have been telling everybody they're
[02:39:16.400 --> 02:39:22.160]  going to shoot if we don't move back as we approach the one-year anniversary of the standoff of the
[02:39:22.160 --> 02:39:27.520]  bundy ranch i want to take another look at what happened especially in light of the lies and slander
[02:39:27.520 --> 02:39:32.880]  from media like glenn beck and the dangerous characterization by obama harry reid homeland
[02:39:32.880 --> 02:39:38.800]  security that labeled the community standing together against brutality as domestic terraces
[02:39:41.360 --> 02:39:45.360]  on april 7th 2014 paul joseph watson wrote an article
[02:39:45.360 --> 02:39:50.640]  armed feds prepare for showdown with novata cattle rancher with the subtitle ruby ridge
[02:39:50.640 --> 02:39:56.720]  style standoff brewing as bundy says he's prepared to be killed the property rights dispute had been
[02:39:56.720 --> 02:40:02.080]  going on for decades but now things were beginning to come to a head hundreds of federal officials
[02:40:02.080 --> 02:40:07.440]  aided by helicopters low-flying aircraft hired cowboys began rounding up bundy's cattle the
[02:40:07.440 --> 02:40:12.160]  preceding weekend as bundy accused them of trespassing and as supporters from the local
[02:40:12.160 --> 02:40:18.320]  community and protesters headed to the area to demand that the feds back off the blm had created
[02:40:18.320 --> 02:40:24.240]  a first amendment area out in the middle of nowhere where demonstrators could voice their
[02:40:24.240 --> 02:40:32.080]  concerns but nowhere else this area right here the small area here was cordoned off with orange uh
[02:40:32.080 --> 02:40:37.040]  temporary like construction barriers march from a free speech zone it just shows you how quickly
[02:40:37.040 --> 02:40:42.160]  your free speech zones can disappear when you allow them to be contained to a very small area
[02:40:42.160 --> 02:40:48.000]  it's gone but we're here and we want to tell the blm something about how upset we are with
[02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:53.280]  what's going on here but there's no government agency here to listen to us that's the whole reason
[02:40:53.280 --> 02:40:58.800]  you don't confine people to remote areas from what's happening not only had the federal agents
[02:40:58.800 --> 02:41:04.400]  been confiscating bundy's cattle they had also set up agents with sniper rifles pointed at the
[02:41:04.400 --> 02:41:12.080]  ranchers pointed at the protesters the crowd had been building throughout the week and on saturday
[02:41:12.080 --> 02:41:16.720]  there was a huge crowd to diffuse it the sheriff came in in the morning to address the crowd and
[02:41:16.720 --> 02:41:21.360]  tell them that the powers that be had graciously consented to allow the last rancher remaining
[02:41:21.360 --> 02:41:26.560]  in business in the area to continue grazing never mind that he had had most of his cattle
[02:41:26.560 --> 02:41:32.960]  wrestled by the army of blm contractors for the past several weeks without being said i believe
[02:41:32.960 --> 02:41:39.440]  a press release has already been put forth that the blm is going to cease this operation
[02:41:43.120 --> 02:41:49.440]  the goldmute allotment will be reopened to the public much to the surprise of the sheriff
[02:41:49.440 --> 02:41:52.000]  bundy said that wasn't good enough
[02:41:52.960 --> 02:41:57.520]  the sheriff this is what we the people are asking this morning
[02:41:59.360 --> 02:42:02.240]  disarm the park service
[02:42:02.240 --> 02:42:17.040]  all blue and red red rock park and all other parts the federal government claims they have
[02:42:17.040 --> 02:42:18.160]  jurisdiction over
[02:42:18.160 --> 02:42:29.840]  yeah take your county bulldozers and uh loaders and tear down the
[02:42:30.960 --> 02:42:38.080]  entrance places the money ticketists and where they uh interest and make us citizens pay their
[02:42:38.080 --> 02:42:49.440]  fees you take down the you get the county equipment out there and tear those things down this morning
[02:42:50.720 --> 02:42:56.560]  what they wanted was for him to exercise his authority as the only lawful law enforcement
[02:42:56.560 --> 02:43:02.240]  in the area and to disarm the blm agents and contractors who had been pointing their sniper
[02:43:02.240 --> 02:43:07.280]  rifles at the protesters and ranchers confiscate their weapons tell them to leave the area and
[02:43:07.280 --> 02:43:13.040]  then stack the weapons on stage bundy gave him one hour to do so at the end of the time limit
[02:43:13.040 --> 02:43:17.280]  bundy announced that it looked like the sheriff wasn't going to do anything no one was surprised
[02:43:17.280 --> 02:43:24.400]  but what did surprise us and surprised the federals was his announcement i guess he's not coming so i
[02:43:24.400 --> 02:43:29.680]  guess uh we had presents we thought we we had a sheriff here but evidently we don't have a sheriff
[02:43:29.680 --> 02:43:39.520]  where we're going to go and take the rest of them out of the compound trails up here about the freeway
[02:43:39.520 --> 02:43:44.080]  i was one of the first ones to get down to the area where the standoff would occur okay people
[02:43:44.080 --> 02:43:50.400]  are now moving they stopped for prayer they had vehicles they had guns that were pointing at us
[02:43:50.400 --> 02:43:54.960]  and they had shields and they had a loudspeaker that was announcing that they would shoot if we
[02:43:54.960 --> 02:44:00.320]  did not leave the area the only mainstream media that was in attendance was one cameraman from fox
[02:44:00.320 --> 02:44:05.760]  news he desperately wanted to get over to the blm and interview them but he was scared to death as
[02:44:05.760 --> 02:44:09.040]  you can see in this video that they were going to shoot him he kept announcing that he was with
[02:44:09.040 --> 02:44:13.840]  fox news he pulled up his shirt to show that he wasn't armed they kept telling him to go back
[02:44:13.840 --> 02:44:20.480]  they did not want him to come to interview them they were in a fighting stance they had 80 different
[02:44:20.480 --> 02:44:27.440]  cars each of them with just one blm agent now to standoff i've got a count of 107 vehicles
[02:44:27.440 --> 02:44:34.720]  107 okay going on the road like that you know the thing of it is all 107 those vehicles were
[02:44:34.720 --> 02:44:43.120]  armed with the armed armed army yes that always fascinated me why would the state highway patrol
[02:44:43.120 --> 02:44:50.000]  allow an army like that on to their highway and and then why would it that army be able to pass
[02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:55.520]  through the city of mesquite without you know any resistance through the state of arizona
[02:44:55.520 --> 02:45:00.960]  without any resistance through the port of entry into utah without any resistance and that army
[02:45:00.960 --> 02:45:09.440]  disappeared disappeared in the state of utah and not one media not one no question at least that
[02:45:09.440 --> 02:45:15.840]  army went across the united states without one question that an army of blm agents 107 cars
[02:45:15.840 --> 02:45:22.240]  of armed men this is exactly what the posse comatose act prohibits it's not just a prohibition
[02:45:22.240 --> 02:45:27.760]  of the military being used for law enforcement understand that posse comatose is latin for
[02:45:27.760 --> 02:45:34.160]  power of the community the posse comatose act prohibits the president from usurping the true
[02:45:34.160 --> 02:45:41.760]  posse comatose the true power of the community with his own posse of armed federal agents
[02:45:41.760 --> 02:45:48.080]  there were clear distinctions too from ferguson and other places where we've seen protests about
[02:45:48.080 --> 02:45:52.640]  a government that's out of control and ferguson businesses in the community were destroyed
[02:45:52.640 --> 02:45:57.840]  and burned as info wars has pointed out in ferguson these looters were coming from outside of
[02:45:57.840 --> 02:46:02.160]  the community they were not the core protesters and of course the same thing could have happened
[02:46:02.160 --> 02:46:07.840]  at bundy ranch i believe the reason that it didn't was because the militia threw out people who were
[02:46:07.840 --> 02:46:14.560]  dangerous or provocateurs people like jared miller who later shot two cops in vegas but rather than
[02:46:14.560 --> 02:46:20.000]  give the militia credit for expelling people like jared miller the media used it to demonize them
[02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:25.120]  another difference about the bundy ranch was that there was a clear achievable objective the people
[02:46:25.120 --> 02:46:37.760]  were peaceful but they were determined the police have been telling everybody they're going to shoot
[02:46:38.480 --> 02:46:44.960]  if we don't move back people are moving forward with their hands in the air holding flags with
[02:46:44.960 --> 02:46:52.720]  both hands in the air it's a mixture of people on foot as you can see people on foot and cowboys
[02:46:52.720 --> 02:46:58.080]  it's epic to see this in hd but i need it's only going to be bundy and his son no that's it it's the
[02:46:58.080 --> 02:47:02.720]  people or not and you guys need to leave okay you need to leave that's that's what i'm telling you
[02:47:02.720 --> 02:47:26.720]  you need to de-escalate the situation
[02:47:32.720 --> 02:47:36.720]  but we're staying here until they're done that's what we're doing
[02:47:36.720 --> 02:47:40.720]  i can back some of these guys up if you promise they won't run me and my partner
[02:47:40.720 --> 02:47:47.280]  whatever you tell us to do as long as it's not to compromise this mission we will do you have
[02:47:47.280 --> 02:47:52.000]  authority all i ask you to do is just stay tight okay so we're all right where we're at
[02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:57.360]  okay this is 1776 no it's not that's right what happened what we call the boston masticore is an
[02:47:57.360 --> 02:48:01.680]  angry mob you can call them bunch of drunk routies they just they're just like guys that like barroom
[02:48:01.680 --> 02:48:05.840]  brawl so i just love being in a fight there's guys like that they're belligerent they'll fight anybody
[02:48:05.840 --> 02:48:13.600]  we were misrepresented by powerful voices so these people who hold themselves out to be patriots
[02:48:13.600 --> 02:48:21.360]  are not they're nothing more than domestic terror we rode over there we didn't come charging guns
[02:48:21.360 --> 02:48:27.920]  ablazing we were not armed there were a couple cowboys that had rifles in their boots their saddle
[02:48:27.920 --> 02:48:35.040]  boots there was one or two riders that may have had a sidearm on their their persons
[02:48:35.040 --> 02:48:40.800]  none of them drew them from their scabbards from the boots i know glenn beck wasn't there
[02:48:40.800 --> 02:48:45.520]  but he can see from the videos taken by the people who were there that nearly all of the people at
[02:48:45.520 --> 02:48:51.360]  the standoff were not armed and those that were had them holstered even as the bureaucrats all of
[02:48:51.360 --> 02:48:57.520]  whom were armed pointed weapons and threatened to shoot people with no guns in their hands marching
[02:48:57.520 --> 02:49:03.920]  and defiance to troops threatening to shoot them that was in the spirit of gondy and barton luther
[02:49:03.920 --> 02:49:09.520]  king but let us not forget that it was gondy who said among the many misdeeds of british rule in
[02:49:09.520 --> 02:49:16.720]  india history will look upon the act of depriving a whole nation of arms as the blackest whether or
[02:49:16.720 --> 02:49:21.600]  not you agree with clive and bundy's position on his grazing rights everyone should be appalled at
[02:49:21.600 --> 02:49:29.040]  the conduct of the blm its agents and its hired contractors free speech containment areas government
[02:49:29.040 --> 02:49:34.800]  snipers pointed at protesters and ranchers for weeks violent brutal confrontations with peaceful
[02:49:34.800 --> 02:49:42.480]  protesters all manifestations of a government that is dangerously out of control the bundy standoff
[02:49:42.480 --> 02:49:48.560]  wasn't just a news event what we saw with the showdown was that there are still americans that won't
[02:49:48.560 --> 02:49:53.520]  be treated like slaves there are still americans that will stand with their neighbors against
[02:49:53.520 --> 02:49:59.840]  an army of federal bureaucrats and contractors that threaten and brutalize them what we covered
[02:49:59.840 --> 02:50:05.760]  in the rural west was a government out of control and acting provocatively as we would see again in
[02:50:05.760 --> 02:50:12.160]  just a couple of months in ferguson unlike ferguson the crowd would not turn into a mob attacking
[02:50:12.160 --> 02:50:17.200]  its neighbors and earning their businesses the community stood together with each other
[02:50:17.200 --> 02:50:22.640]  resolutely and in a determined way made it clear that they were not looking for a fight
[02:50:22.640 --> 02:50:27.360]  but they weren't going to back down either what the bundy family and their neighbors demonstrated
[02:50:27.360 --> 02:50:33.040]  to the nation was that power truly lies with the community and that when the community stands
[02:50:33.040 --> 02:50:38.320]  together neighbor with neighbor against a violent and brutal government the thugs will back down
[02:50:38.320 --> 02:50:44.720]  and slink away unlike glenn beck and obama thomas jefferson would have approved of what happened
[02:50:44.720 --> 02:50:51.040]  at the bundy ranch standoff he wrote in 1787 what country can preserve its liberties if its
[02:50:51.040 --> 02:50:56.480]  rulers are not warned from time to time that his people preserve the spirit of resistance
[02:50:57.360 --> 02:51:01.440]  let them take arms for info wars nightly news i'm david night
[02:51:03.360 --> 02:51:07.760]  well that is just an a plus job better than anything you'll see on vice you name it i'm not
[02:51:07.760 --> 02:51:12.560]  in competition with things like vice this is so historical for everything you just pointed out
[02:51:12.560 --> 02:51:17.760]  and more david night josh owens who were there my dream to build info wars to have the reporters
[02:51:17.760 --> 02:51:23.040]  and the crew to be able to cover things like this their attempt to demonize it it failed
[02:51:23.040 --> 02:51:28.160]  they even got the fake right to get involved in demonizing it didn't work the truth is people saw
[02:51:28.160 --> 02:51:33.360]  the dogs being set on women and people being told they couldn't even have free speech zones finally
[02:51:33.360 --> 02:51:41.680]  in the desert people knew this was totalitarianism so over a thousand folks at once showed up
[02:51:42.400 --> 02:51:48.240]  they were tired of snipers aiming guns at them they shot a kid 50 miles away in the back on his
[02:51:48.240 --> 02:51:52.880]  bike you try to go out these rural areas where there's not even a building or a person for
[02:51:52.880 --> 02:52:00.480]  60 70 miles and you'll be out in the middle of nowhere and you'll look over and it'll be an armed
[02:52:00.480 --> 02:52:06.480]  BLM person one what are you doing and you'll be like i'm just sitting here with my friends out
[02:52:06.480 --> 02:52:11.200]  here in the middle of nowhere and you're there totally legal lawful they want us off of and they've
[02:52:11.200 --> 02:52:15.280]  been running these people off who've been using this land under common law but see bundy knows the
[02:52:15.280 --> 02:52:20.720]  law he knows about port of entry into states he knows that just 20 30 years ago you know cops wouldn't
[02:52:20.720 --> 02:52:25.440]  let the feds come through without authorization now they're just here dominating it's breaking our
[02:52:25.440 --> 02:52:30.640]  will they're not even feds they're run by foreign banks just like tony blairs in the news yesterday
[02:52:30.640 --> 02:52:34.000]  going yeah we have point leaders in europe now we're going to do it in other countries
[02:52:36.000 --> 02:52:40.240]  they're just hiding it in plain view just appointing the leaders i want to finish up with
[02:52:40.240 --> 02:52:45.040]  you guys and then go to matthew and others that are patiently holding but this is such a big deal
[02:52:45.040 --> 02:52:50.640]  now with the forced inoculation news and the irs taking people's bank accounts that don't get the
[02:52:50.640 --> 02:52:55.680]  obama care news or people that can't even get the obama care having their their other wages garnished
[02:52:55.680 --> 02:53:00.640]  all this is being announced this is classical tyranny you don't have to be a political scientist
[02:53:00.640 --> 02:53:05.920]  to recognize and it's so scary and it's just getting started and what this tells the feds and
[02:53:05.920 --> 02:53:12.240]  the occupiers the globalist is when you do this stuff in the future people aren't scared if if
[02:53:12.240 --> 02:53:18.240]  you're ready to start shooting us just like bunker hill lexton concord go ahead and do it
[02:53:18.240 --> 02:53:22.080]  okay our guns are at our sides they're on our backs you're threatening to shoot us
[02:53:22.080 --> 02:53:25.440]  we have the loudspeaker you can barely understand it but you were there everybody reported they
[02:53:25.440 --> 02:53:29.200]  said it they admitted they said it we're going to shoot we're going to shoot you march up just
[02:53:29.200 --> 02:53:34.160]  like the end of viva vendetta they don't shoot it's that moment and i guarantee you most those
[02:53:34.160 --> 02:53:38.480]  military guys and the creepy contractors and the rest of it i guaranteed we're like why are we out
[02:53:38.480 --> 02:53:42.800]  here killing some guys cows yeah you know why i guarantee you they weren't ready to die for this
[02:53:42.800 --> 02:53:48.560]  either and so it came that moment of chicken they backed off it freaked the gangsters out like harry
[02:53:48.560 --> 02:53:53.840]  reid and then you understand when they blow up federal buildings and blame it on us or shoot a
[02:53:53.840 --> 02:53:58.800]  few cops and blame it on some loons that are obsessed with uh you know superheroes stuff and
[02:53:58.800 --> 02:54:04.400]  into nihilism we're not going to buy you blaming us we're not here to be enslaved we're not here to
[02:54:04.400 --> 02:54:11.200]  be canon fought in your civil war we don't want a physical war but when push comes to shove it's over
[02:54:11.200 --> 02:54:15.680]  and if they would have massacred the people out there it would have caused the revolution from
[02:54:15.680 --> 02:54:20.320]  our angle no amount of false flags would have won that's why they didn't want to have the revolution
[02:54:20.320 --> 02:54:24.880]  there and backed off they want to have false flags to say we lost the revolution by blowing up
[02:54:24.880 --> 02:54:29.200]  daycare centers guaranteed they'll pick a place with kids theme park you name it they're going to
[02:54:29.200 --> 02:54:34.640]  blame us we have democratic internal memos you know that even fox news is covered about terror
[02:54:34.640 --> 02:54:41.680]  attacks to blame the left the libertarian movements the right wing the classical liberals and so
[02:54:41.680 --> 02:54:46.480]  that's the game plan uh josh owens a few minutes on your take on all this it's almost unbelievable
[02:54:46.480 --> 02:54:51.920]  to see that footage again a year later i you know i almost forgot how the immensity of that day
[02:54:51.920 --> 02:54:56.320]  how many people were out there and i mean even watching the video and remembering back to what
[02:54:56.320 --> 02:55:01.680]  happened i honestly saw one guy that was in that video one guy who had a gun on his side
[02:55:01.680 --> 02:55:05.360]  that was the only gun that i saw out there the whole time but the point is is that what was going
[02:55:05.360 --> 02:55:08.880]  on out there was such a big deal and it was a culmination of what had been going on for the
[02:55:08.880 --> 02:55:13.680]  past well these were real americans and the truth is we're not scared to die we're sick of it right
[02:55:13.680 --> 02:55:17.840]  well i mean even one night we drove out we we drove out in the middle of the desert it was dark
[02:55:17.840 --> 02:55:21.280]  middle of the desert we saw lights on the side of the road and when we pulled over is when we saw
[02:55:21.280 --> 02:55:25.760]  the bundy's family the the woman who had been thrown on the ground her knees were scraped bloody
[02:55:25.760 --> 02:55:29.600]  the brother who had been shot with a cop showing up on the side of the road no no we're going
[02:55:29.600 --> 02:55:34.160]  you can't stand on the american flag in the middle of the desert i mean what i mean while the borders
[02:55:34.160 --> 02:55:38.800]  are wide open while the illegal aliens can get free health care do whatever they want fine
[02:55:38.800 --> 02:55:45.120]  then let us stand in the desert no no no harry reese taking this to give it to the chinese government
[02:55:45.120 --> 02:55:48.880]  go ahead sorry but and people had had enough and that's what happened that's that's it was the
[02:55:48.880 --> 02:55:53.040]  culmination of everything that had happened that day and it's just unbelievable to watch it when
[02:55:53.040 --> 02:55:58.320]  you saw clavin bundy say you know tear down the kiosks hand in the guns and that sheriff was
[02:55:58.320 --> 02:56:03.440]  literally shaking he was sending their shaking and he didn't know that people were ready if they
[02:56:03.440 --> 02:56:08.560]  had attacked anybody then it would have been boom oh man but it was alex it was just like
[02:56:09.520 --> 02:56:13.520]  like josh was saying people who had had free access to this area not just for cattle
[02:56:13.520 --> 02:56:18.080]  grazing rights which was a this was like the real movie open range about to happen with
[02:56:18.080 --> 02:56:22.640]  kevin costner great movie yeah i mean this was really about to happen well you know what it also
[02:56:22.640 --> 02:56:27.200]  reminded me of was of course a berlin wall where people were finally fed up enough with it that
[02:56:27.200 --> 02:56:32.320]  they just marched en masse and defied the people to shoot them the boy finnequin the guy that we
[02:56:32.320 --> 02:56:36.080]  had there briefly the arizona rancher who came over one of the things we didn't have in that video
[02:56:36.080 --> 02:56:40.720]  was he said we rode in there on horses because you're not going to taser a man on a 1200 pound
[02:56:40.720 --> 02:56:44.800]  animal you're going to have to shoot him off and he was willing to be shot off he didn't go in there
[02:56:44.800 --> 02:56:48.320]  carrying a gun they went in there they prayed about it before they went in and they're very calmly
[02:56:48.320 --> 02:56:52.400]  as you can see they didn't go in their guns of blazing they weren't yahoo's like david barton
[02:56:52.400 --> 02:56:56.480]  was saying they weren't itching for a fight they just wanted these are the opposite i mean these
[02:56:56.480 --> 02:57:02.000]  are the opposite of people like that exactly exactly very calm very organized they they got the
[02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:06.080]  agent provocateurs out of their midst and they walked very calmly up there and made their demands
[02:57:06.080 --> 02:57:10.720]  they had something that they wanted they had one thing that they did get which was a cattle back
[02:57:10.720 --> 02:57:15.040]  and actually they got the uh the blm out of that area i'm sure they're going to be back but they got
[02:57:15.040 --> 02:57:18.240]  them out for the time being that was the other thing that they wanted this scared the globalists
[02:57:18.240 --> 02:57:21.680]  to their very core yeah and it's made them recalculate everything and i'm just going to tell harry
[02:57:21.680 --> 02:57:27.360]  reid the clinton's obama and the globalist behind him george soros do not pull new oklahoma cities
[02:57:28.240 --> 02:57:32.240]  and it's not going to fly and you know that in your gut i know you got where you are because
[02:57:32.240 --> 02:57:38.080]  of hutzpah and arrogance and taking your invincible but you're not invincible you understand your rat
[02:57:38.080 --> 02:57:42.560]  piece of garbage you got away with all that nazi collaborated when you were 14 you're not going
[02:57:42.560 --> 02:57:47.120]  to get away with this and final words on that i'm gonna go to overdrive and go to matthew and others
[02:57:47.120 --> 02:57:53.600]  this year it's not harry reid but it's john mccain and it's not nevada but it's arizona and what he's
[02:57:53.600 --> 02:57:57.840]  doing is he's taken this massive area that was part of an indian reservation it was part of a
[02:57:57.840 --> 02:58:02.080]  national park it was an historical monument they've turned it over to a foreign corporation
[02:58:02.080 --> 02:58:05.200]  to mine the copper and when they're finished with it it's going to be a crater that'll be
[02:58:05.200 --> 02:58:09.360]  visible from space they're going to completely destroy the area so it's got all these different
[02:58:09.360 --> 02:58:14.720]  aspects to it i mean you could say that uh it's like yellowstone gettysburg and bethlehem all
[02:58:14.720 --> 02:58:18.400]  tied together because there's some religious significance there to the indians this was set
[02:58:18.400 --> 02:58:23.520]  aside in 1955 by eisenhower and what's worse is they're going to use a legitimate thing
[02:58:23.520 --> 02:58:28.720]  you know like land there illegitimately take it to demonize republican moves that are good
[02:58:28.720 --> 02:58:33.040]  to give some of the public land back to the states for the people in areas that are by the towns and
[02:58:33.040 --> 02:58:38.240]  things then this power grab will be used as credit legitimate federal lands going back to the people
[02:58:38.240 --> 02:58:42.000]  that's how they run these operations amazing i know you'll be covering more on the nightly news

[03:03:41.600 --> 03:03:47.120]  i believe in a free market libertarianism and localized agriculture but i definitely recognize
[03:03:47.120 --> 03:03:53.840]  a palpable political economics or environmental bioengineered strangulation that i realize is
[03:03:53.840 --> 03:03:58.720]  imposed upon the citizenry yep and i know all the listeners do and everything else
