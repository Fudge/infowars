[00:23.600 --> 00:30.600]  Live in life without the headaches.
[00:53.600 --> 01:06.600]  Live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:06.600 --> 01:09.600]  We have a very important guest joining us today.
[01:09.600 --> 01:19.600]  He's a father of a serviceman who has refused to be redeployed to Iraq because he's stating on the record that he will not follow illegal orders.
[01:19.600 --> 01:23.600]  And so we'll be talking to the serviceman's father coming up in the second hour.
[01:23.600 --> 01:35.600]  In the meantime, I want to play an O'Reilly factor clip to break down and analyze the low-grade, moron-level propaganda that O'Reilly uses.
[01:35.600 --> 01:38.600]  But that's why he's so effective.
[01:38.600 --> 01:48.600]  He's playing to that 40-50% of the American population who literally are mind-numbed robots.
[01:48.600 --> 01:56.600]  They literally just watch television, go to work, and believe whatever the media and the government say.
[01:56.600 --> 02:03.600]  I don't watch a lot of television, but I do watch little news clips of key commentators and track the information.
[02:03.600 --> 02:11.600]  So I watch a few clips of O'Reilly every week and he's getting more and more mindless, more and more simplistic.
[02:11.600 --> 02:21.600]  I mean, they could basically have a robot doll that would just sit there and say, you're an idiot, you're a kook, you're a minority, and no one agrees with you.
[02:21.600 --> 02:30.600]  You're a kook, you're an idiot, you're a moron, you're a very small group, the American people hate you, you're a terrorist, you support terrorists.
[02:30.600 --> 02:33.600]  That's all he says.
[02:33.600 --> 02:39.600]  What's he get paid like $10 million a year to just sit there and repeat that?
[02:39.600 --> 02:41.600]  It's unbelievable.
[02:41.600 --> 02:51.600]  Then we have another clip, Lou Dobbs on fire last night saying they're bringing in one world government, that it's a new world order, and the destruction of the U.S.
[02:51.600 --> 02:58.600]  Because a new report was issued yesterday by the globalists saying we're not done with the North American Union.
[02:58.600 --> 03:01.600]  They want to go ahead and merge it now into the Pan-American Union.
[03:01.600 --> 03:05.600]  So for a year and a half, we've been inside the North American Union.
[03:05.600 --> 03:14.600]  Now they're already trying to merge it into the Pan-American Union, but they've got to kill Hugo Chavez first, which they've been trying to do, so we'll see what happens there.
[03:14.600 --> 03:25.600]  But I'll tell you, it feels really good to have major newspapers and people like Lou Dobbs reporting the truth because it's shocking and amazing mind-numbed robots.
[03:25.600 --> 03:32.600]  The brainwash type out there who believe whatever is on TV just not anything we talk about isn't true.
[03:32.600 --> 03:35.600]  Okay, but as soon as it's on television, it must be true.
[03:35.600 --> 03:42.600]  And they're literally having problems computing right now because the White House admits we're in the North American Union.
[03:42.600 --> 03:45.600]  The documents are there and available.
[03:45.600 --> 03:52.600]  It is now getting out to the public, and it is making people out there take a double take because they're going, wait a minute.
[03:52.600 --> 03:55.600]  He told the truth about the Amnesty program.
[03:55.600 --> 03:57.600]  He told the truth about the North American Union.
[03:57.600 --> 04:05.600]  He told the truth about so many other issues, and now he's telling the truth about this.
[04:05.600 --> 04:09.600]  You see, so many people won't check out my claims.
[04:09.600 --> 04:13.600]  And so for years, they'll just think I'm up here making this stuff up.
[04:13.600 --> 04:18.600]  Believe me, I wish every day that I was making this up.
[04:18.600 --> 04:19.600]  We're not.
[04:19.600 --> 04:22.600]  We don't have words to describe how serious it is.
[04:22.600 --> 04:28.600]  The Neocons attacked Somalia yesterday. Anybody they attack is called Al-Qaeda.
[04:28.600 --> 04:35.600]  Also, a really scary report here out of the Austin American statesman that I missed, and it was also picked up by UPI.
[04:35.600 --> 04:41.600]  This came out a few weeks ago, and it's up on prisonplanet.com.
[04:41.600 --> 04:45.600]  A headline, mishap in dismantling nuclear warhead.
[04:45.600 --> 04:50.600]  Warhead almost detonates in Texas.
[04:50.600 --> 04:57.600]  Again, none of us can track or follow all the news, and you can vet your bottom dollar.
[04:57.600 --> 05:06.600]  When there is a mishap in a nuclear plant or at a nuclear weapons facility, it's going to be blamed on shadowy Al-Qaeda groups when it's an accident.
[05:06.600 --> 05:12.600]  That's a whole other level of tyranny.
[05:12.600 --> 05:16.600]  The Democrats are not really challenging Bush's expansion war plan.
[05:16.600 --> 05:19.600]  We'll break that down.
[05:19.600 --> 05:23.600]  It's a very important broadcast that we have lined up for you today.
[05:23.600 --> 05:25.600]  I really hope you'll stay with us.

[06:01.600 --> 06:11.600]  We'll see you in the next one.
[06:31.600 --> 06:35.600]  We're watching it right now online at prisonplanet.tv.
[06:35.600 --> 06:39.600]  Dad, can we stop? We need to go to the bathroom.
[06:39.600 --> 06:43.600]  What? Again? We just stopped two hours ago.
[06:43.600 --> 06:47.600]  Honey, let's stop, because I gave the kids their spark-burkey water bottles.
[06:47.600 --> 06:49.600]  Why did you do that?
[06:49.600 --> 06:53.600]  Because they can't drink and talk at the same time, and that way we don't have to listen to them singing.
[06:53.600 --> 06:56.600]  Are we there yet? Are we there yet?
[06:56.600 --> 06:57.600]  For the entire trip.
[06:57.600 --> 07:01.600]  Hmm, I didn't think about that. Great idea.
[07:01.600 --> 07:04.600]  Yeah, and it's cheap entertainment for the kids.
[07:04.600 --> 07:11.600]  Bottled water costs around 75 cents a bottle, and using our burky sport bottles, it costs us less than two and a half cents per refill.
[07:11.600 --> 07:14.600]  Honey, you're terrific.
[07:14.600 --> 07:19.600]  Oh, honey, so are you. You're the one that bought the family our sport burky water bottles.
[07:19.600 --> 07:22.600]  Now can we stop? I need to go too.
[07:22.600 --> 07:29.600]  Get your burky sport purification bottle for only $39 by calling new millennium at 888-803-4438.
[07:29.600 --> 07:35.600]  That's 888-803-4438, or order on the web at burkywater.com.
[07:35.600 --> 07:40.600]  Times are tough right now, but there are a lot of different ways to get ourselves out of this mess,
[07:40.600 --> 07:44.600]  providing for our own food, water, and power are a good start.
[07:44.600 --> 07:51.600]  As you may have heard by now, Ken Solar has been configuring alternative energy packages for over a decade.

[08:35.600 --> 08:48.600]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[08:48.600 --> 08:52.600]  All right, folks. This is Alex Jones from I-35.
[08:52.600 --> 09:02.600]  I'm taking a well-deserved short family vacation to go visit with my family here in Texas, and I'm driving that I-35.
[09:02.600 --> 09:10.600]  And we're going to go back to a great rebroadcast actually from last week with the obsolete man and a bunch of other interviews and key things we covered.
[09:10.600 --> 09:16.600]  But in the meantime, I want to announce in case anybody missed it, that's why I'm joining you via cell phone with 18-wheelers on both sides of me.
[09:16.600 --> 09:22.600]  As I hurled down I-35 in the lane, is that Ron Paul has announced for president.
[09:22.600 --> 09:25.600]  The media is saying he's thinking about running for president.
[09:25.600 --> 09:29.600]  We talked to his office this morning before I got on the road. He is running for president.
[09:29.600 --> 09:34.600]  We have a big report out on this on prisonplanet.com in the next few hours.
[09:34.600 --> 09:37.600]  The Washington Post is reporting he's considering running for president.
[09:37.600 --> 09:40.600]  Ron Paul's office told us he is running for president.
[09:40.600 --> 09:47.600]  You know, this show has lobbied him to run for president. Many of you have lobbied for him to run for president, and he's a routine guest.
[09:47.600 --> 09:52.600]  He's going to be scheduled next week with Jack Blood and when Bob Dacier is sitting in, they're both sitting in next week.
[09:52.600 --> 10:00.600]  Different days, I'm not sure which day next week that Congressman Ron Paul will be there.
[10:00.600 --> 10:05.600]  But they told us his office said he will be there for 30 minutes next week.
[10:05.600 --> 10:10.600]  Again, he is running for president. He has the trifecta. He's anti-war.
[10:10.600 --> 10:13.600]  He's a constitutionalist, and he's a libertarian.
[10:13.600 --> 10:16.600]  He has a conservative voting record in Congress.
[10:16.600 --> 10:21.600]  Delay in Texas tried to rewrite the district to defeat him,
[10:21.600 --> 10:24.600]  kicked him out of his Republican district into a liberal district,
[10:24.600 --> 10:32.600]  and he won by an even bigger landslide with 65% of the vote down in the Galveston County and surrounding areas.
[10:32.600 --> 10:37.600]  I'm driving through right now. And so this is absolutely amazing.
[10:37.600 --> 10:42.600]  This is so exciting that this is happening.
[10:42.600 --> 10:44.600]  And he truly is the dark horse candidate.
[10:44.600 --> 10:48.600]  And by dark horse, he is the ace in the hole.
[10:48.600 --> 10:52.600]  Of course, we have election fraud with about 35% of the country we know,
[10:52.600 --> 10:57.600]  but I talked to Ron Paul off here last time he was on a few months ago,
[10:57.600 --> 11:00.600]  and I said, everybody wants you to run for president. You've got to run for president.
[11:00.600 --> 11:03.600]  He said, look, I think my liberty committee is the answer,
[11:03.600 --> 11:10.600]  getting a big caucus in Congress that's anti-UN, anti-fellow reserve, anti-New World War.
[11:10.600 --> 11:15.600]  He said they would come down on me too hard, they would crush me, and they would destroy me in the media.
[11:15.600 --> 11:17.600]  And I said, well, we need you to do it, Congressman.
[11:17.600 --> 11:22.600]  You know there's nobody else that's got the appeal that you do in national polls.
[11:22.600 --> 11:25.600]  A few of them have been done in the last two years.
[11:25.600 --> 11:32.600]  Ron Paul has over a 65% approval rating, the same thing he just got in an election here in Texas.
[11:32.600 --> 11:35.600]  He's gotten a tie at 68%.
[11:35.600 --> 11:40.600]  Tom Tancrino is not running. Tom Tancrino is nothing compared to Ron Paul.
[11:40.600 --> 11:43.600]  He's won on a lot of issues, right on some.
[11:43.600 --> 11:49.600]  Ron Paul is right on every single issue, every single issue.
[11:49.600 --> 11:53.600]  Congressman Ron Paul is running for president.
[11:53.600 --> 11:57.600]  The Democrats should vote for him. They should know. They should know.
[11:57.600 --> 11:59.600]  And they should mobilize behind him.
[11:59.600 --> 12:01.600]  The Democratic leadership is pro-war.
[12:01.600 --> 12:03.600]  They're just arguing about whether to escalate or not.
[12:03.600 --> 12:08.600]  Hillary and Schumer and all the rest of them want to go into Iran and go into Syria.
[12:08.600 --> 12:10.600]  They're totally criminal party.
[12:10.600 --> 12:13.600]  They're trying to implement more police state legislation.
[12:13.600 --> 12:18.600]  They don't want to repeal Patriot Act or HR 6166 Military Commissions Act
[12:18.600 --> 12:22.600]  or the John Warner Defense Operational Act of 2007 that literally makes George Bush a dictator.
[12:22.600 --> 12:25.600]  The Democrats are bought and paid for by the same people.
[12:25.600 --> 12:27.600]  No one has a record like Ron Paul.
[12:27.600 --> 12:32.600]  A battle-heartened combat flight surgeon who served two tours in Vietnam.
[12:32.600 --> 12:38.600]  We're talking about an American here who has practiced as a family doctor.
[12:38.600 --> 12:42.600]  We're talking about a man who's been in Congress off and on since the 70s
[12:42.600 --> 12:45.600]  and has never once compromised.
[12:45.600 --> 12:49.600]  You're talking about a man our personal friends with who I absolutely respect.
[12:49.600 --> 12:52.600]  I know I'm telling you, we've all got to get behind him.
[12:52.600 --> 12:55.600]  This is why, even if they stage the election, even if they demonize him and attack him,
[12:55.600 --> 12:58.600]  and even if he doesn't get the Republican nomination,
[12:58.600 --> 13:02.600]  Congressman Ron Paul will be able to educate people on a national platform.
[13:02.600 --> 13:04.600]  They cannot ignore him.
[13:04.600 --> 13:08.600]  This is a boon to liberty, a boon to freedom, a boon to our society.
[13:08.600 --> 13:10.600]  This is so exciting.
[13:10.600 --> 13:12.600]  And make no mistake, Genesis Listers.
[13:12.600 --> 13:17.600]  Genesis Communications Radio Network Listers are affiliates from Knoxville, Tennessee,
[13:17.600 --> 13:22.600]  to Kansas City, to Chicago, to Austin, Texas, Radio Free Austin, you name it.
[13:22.600 --> 13:25.600]  You are the reason Ron Paul is running for president.
[13:25.600 --> 13:26.600]  A big part of it.
[13:26.600 --> 13:30.600]  We have lobbied the daylights out of him for the last year to run for president.
[13:30.600 --> 13:31.600]  We've got to get behind him.
[13:31.600 --> 13:33.600]  We've got to contribute to him.
[13:33.600 --> 13:37.600]  We have got to absolutely support him and let the mainstream media try to demonize him.
[13:37.600 --> 13:39.600]  That's why they lost all credibility.
[13:39.600 --> 13:41.600]  We have a good chance for him to win New Hampshire.
[13:41.600 --> 13:44.600]  We have a good chance for him to get the nomination.
[13:44.600 --> 13:46.600]  Frankly, he'd be in great danger at that point,
[13:46.600 --> 13:47.600]  but he knows that.
[13:47.600 --> 13:48.600]  He's a veteran.
[13:48.600 --> 13:50.600]  He's fighting for his country again.
[13:50.600 --> 13:53.600]  This is the most exciting thing I have seen in years.
[13:53.600 --> 13:58.600]  Frankly, it's got me ready to turn around and not go on vacation because this is so huge.
[13:58.600 --> 14:00.600]  Back to the retransmission.
[14:00.600 --> 14:03.600]  And again, I am so thankful to everybody out there.
[14:03.600 --> 14:06.600]  Ron Paul running for president.
[14:06.600 --> 14:10.600]  Anti-war, anti-UN, anti-New World Order.
[14:10.600 --> 14:16.600]  A constitutionalist that liberals can vote for, very popular with Democrats, very popular with Republicans,
[14:16.600 --> 14:23.600]  very popular with libertarians from which he springs, running as a Republican.
[14:23.600 --> 14:27.600]  I've talked to so many top political experts who agree with my analysis.
[14:27.600 --> 14:29.600]  It's not even an art analysis.
[14:29.600 --> 14:30.600]  It's easy.
[14:30.600 --> 14:35.600]  Ron Paul is the strongest and the only viable anti-New World Order candidate.
[14:35.600 --> 14:37.600]  This is a perfect storm that's happening right now.
[14:37.600 --> 14:39.600]  The people know both parties have sold them out.
[14:39.600 --> 14:40.600]  That's why he's running.
[14:40.600 --> 14:42.600]  That's why he's throwing it all at the table.
[14:42.600 --> 14:43.600]  He is in the arena.
[14:43.600 --> 14:46.600]  He's going to be fighting their biggest gladiators, ladies and gentlemen.
[14:46.600 --> 14:48.600]  He's going up against the big guns.
[14:48.600 --> 14:50.600]  He's the next wing, going up against the Death Star.
[14:50.600 --> 14:56.600]  We have got to support Congressman Ron Paul and pray for him and pray for him.
[14:56.600 --> 14:58.600]  All right, Ron Paul is on the show next week.
[14:58.600 --> 14:59.600]  God bless you all.
[14:59.600 --> 15:01.600]  Death to the New World Order.
[15:01.600 --> 15:02.600]  We shall prevail.
[15:02.600 --> 15:03.600]  Back to retransmission.
[15:03.600 --> 15:04.600]  Intelligence gathering.
[15:04.600 --> 15:06.600]  They are merging our regulations.
[15:06.600 --> 15:12.600]  They are merging the 25 big federal agencies under Homeland Security with the respective
[15:12.600 --> 15:19.600]  agencies in Mexico and Canada through the last 100 years of financing and the corporations
[15:19.600 --> 15:20.600]  writing legislation.
[15:20.600 --> 15:32.600]  The three governments fit together like three Legos, like snap tools, like a jigsaw puzzle.
[15:32.600 --> 15:37.600]  It just goes together like a hand and glove, like a horse and garage.
[15:37.600 --> 15:42.600]  All crafted, all machined, plop into place.
[15:42.600 --> 15:48.600]  And why do they want a new government to erase the Bill of Rights and Constitution and any
[15:48.600 --> 15:54.600]  vestiges of common law in our body of law?
[15:54.600 --> 16:01.600]  They are replacing what we were with the new, no new process, no liberty, no freedom, no
[16:01.600 --> 16:09.600]  families, forced drugging, total control, no jobs of any significance, no control of your
[16:09.600 --> 16:12.600]  destiny, a nightmare.
[16:12.600 --> 16:14.600]  Guess what they got?
[16:14.600 --> 16:16.600]  Freedom of Information Act yesterday.
[16:16.600 --> 16:18.600]  This is Yahoo News.
[16:18.600 --> 16:24.600]  Social Security Agreement with Mexico released after three and a half year Freedom of Information
[16:24.600 --> 16:25.600]  Act battle.
[16:25.600 --> 16:30.600]  PR News wired for numerous refusals over the three and a half years.
[16:30.600 --> 16:37.600]  Social Security Administration, SSA, has released the first known public copy of the U.S. Social
[16:37.600 --> 16:40.600]  Security Totalization.
[16:40.600 --> 16:43.600]  That's like saying we're not for global government, we're for global governance.
[16:43.600 --> 16:45.600]  Totalization, merger.
[16:45.600 --> 16:50.600]  U.S., Mexico, Social Security, Totalization Agreement.
[16:50.600 --> 16:52.600]  That's merger.
[16:52.600 --> 16:55.600]  Totalization means merging all the numbers, the total.
[16:55.600 --> 17:00.600]  The government was forced to make the disclosure in response to lawsuits filed under Freedom
[17:00.600 --> 17:07.600]  of Information Act by the TREA Senior Citizens League, the second largest senior citizens
[17:07.600 --> 17:14.600]  organization in the U.S. Dwarf by AARP, which is totally bought and paid for by the globalist.
[17:14.600 --> 17:19.600]  The Totalization Agreement could allow millions of illegal Mexican workers to draw billions
[17:19.600 --> 17:23.600]  of dollars from U.S. Social Security Trust Fund.
[17:23.600 --> 17:29.600]  The agreement between the U.S. and Mexico was signed in June of 2004 and is awaiting President
[17:29.600 --> 17:30.600]  Bush's signature.
[17:30.600 --> 17:35.600]  Once President Bush approves the agreement, which could be done without Congress's vote,
[17:35.600 --> 17:42.600]  either House of Congress, neither House, would have 60 days to disapprove the agreement by
[17:42.600 --> 17:45.600]  voting to reject it.
[17:45.600 --> 17:50.600]  The Social Security Administration itself warns that Social Security is within decades of bankruptcy.
[17:50.600 --> 17:57.600]  It's already bankrupt, yet they seem to have no problem making arrangements and agreements
[17:57.600 --> 18:05.600]  that hasten its demise, said Ralph McCutchen, Chairman of the TREA Senior Citizens League.
[18:05.600 --> 18:09.600]  Okay.
[18:09.600 --> 18:14.600]  They're merging every department, every agency.
[18:14.600 --> 18:16.600]  I mean, look at this story right here.
[18:16.600 --> 18:25.600]  They're not just in name merging the agencies and the laws and the regulations that this
[18:25.600 --> 18:32.600]  North American SPP group just writes up and then the heads of the agencies just implement
[18:32.600 --> 18:38.600]  without Congress even knowing what's going on or having any oversight.
[18:38.600 --> 18:40.600]  They're physically getting rid of the border.
[18:40.600 --> 18:45.600]  They're physically coming in and lobbying and buying up the politicians at the state level
[18:45.600 --> 18:51.600]  who then hand the roads over to those international bodies and their subsidiary companies and
[18:51.600 --> 18:56.600]  governmental organizations both, public-private partnership.
[18:56.600 --> 19:05.600]  We also have the taxation systems being equalized and being merged.
[19:05.600 --> 19:16.600]  And we have our military, 20% of the ground troops in Iraq are non-citizens.
[19:16.600 --> 19:23.600]  And if you go read the actual text of testimony before Congress last year, they're saying that
[19:23.600 --> 19:32.600]  by 2010, half of ground forces, infantry forces in the Marine Corps and the Army are projected
[19:32.600 --> 19:40.600]  to be non-citizen.
[19:40.600 --> 19:45.600]  And the Boston Globe reports they're, quote, considering expanding the number of non-citizens
[19:45.600 --> 19:48.600]  in the ranks and expanding recruiting stations overseas.
[19:48.600 --> 19:53.600]  The average American has no idea there's recruiting stations overseas in the Philippines,
[19:53.600 --> 19:58.600]  in Mexico City, from Manila to Mexico City, and in Eastern Europe.
[19:58.600 --> 20:02.600]  They have no idea they're recruiting convicted felons, aggravated felons.
[20:02.600 --> 20:04.600]  That's been, though, in the news.
[20:04.600 --> 20:06.600]  The back of the paper.
[20:06.600 --> 20:10.600]  I mean, you can't get any more New World War than that.
[20:10.600 --> 20:11.600]  We come back.
[20:11.600 --> 20:16.600]  I'll continue with the evidence of the death of the United States in 2006.
[20:16.600 --> 20:26.600]  And then we'll look forward into 2007, the year of the primacy of the American Union.
[20:26.600 --> 20:30.600]  And all this data I'm putting out fits into both these columns.
[20:30.600 --> 20:31.600]  We'll be right back.
[20:31.600 --> 21:00.600]  We'll be right back.
[21:01.600 --> 21:30.600]  We'll be right back.
[21:31.600 --> 21:58.600]  We'll be right back.
[21:58.600 --> 22:24.600]  We'll be right back.
[22:28.600 --> 22:55.600]  We'll be right back.
[22:55.600 --> 23:22.600]  We'll be right back.
[23:22.600 --> 23:51.600]  We'll be right back.
[23:52.600 --> 24:19.600]  We'll be right back.
[24:19.600 --> 24:40.600]  We'll be right back.
[24:49.600 --> 24:56.600]  Welcome back.
[24:56.600 --> 25:01.600]  So 2006 is the year America died.
[25:01.600 --> 25:11.600]  They've been a long, laborious program to do it, but they officially, after carrying out the terror attacks,
[25:11.600 --> 25:23.600]  took all the bureaucracies under the control of Homeland Security that Homeland Security could implement the merger without Congress's oversight with Mexico and Canada.
[25:23.600 --> 25:27.600]  And then now they're advertising the North American Union as a way to keep us all safe.
[25:27.600 --> 25:32.600]  I'll never forget, U.N. General McKenzie, the Wednesday after a week after 9-11,
[25:32.600 --> 25:52.600]  saying that we're going to have a continental security perimeter with Mexican, U.S. and Canadian troops patrolling the physical border of North America down from Alaska down to the border of Mexico with Guatemala.
[25:52.600 --> 25:59.600]  And then now Robert Pasteur and others have been in the press and on CNN saying the exact same thing.
[25:59.600 --> 26:04.600]  The only thing that will keep you safe from terrorist is the North American Union.
[26:04.600 --> 26:07.600]  I mean, these guys are incredible.
[26:07.600 --> 26:14.600]  And of course, I was watching an old C-SPAN CFR meeting last night getting clips out of it for a film I'm making, and there they were there.
[26:14.600 --> 26:24.600]  It was the Gary Hart-Rudman-Warrant-Rudman Commission, which every one of their recommendations, all 50 of them, got implemented into the letter.
[26:24.600 --> 26:34.600]  It was the National Homeland Security and just Patriot Act, just every one of the things that had already been written and packaged and was prepared.
[26:34.600 --> 26:38.600]  And so we do not have a border.
[26:38.600 --> 26:51.600]  They are with the new blanket Amnesty program that they're set to reintroduce in the next few days as Congress prepares to reconvene this week with Democrats' first order of business.
[26:51.600 --> 26:54.600]  It's a hate crimes law to restrict free speech.
[26:54.600 --> 26:58.600]  And of course, a guest worker blanket Amnesty program.
[26:58.600 --> 27:02.600]  They are, again, emerging our social security systems.
[27:02.600 --> 27:06.600]  They are recruiting heavily out of the third world to make up our military.
[27:06.600 --> 27:12.600]  Of course, non-U.S. citizens are more likely to fire on U.S. citizens and to follow orders.
[27:12.600 --> 27:18.600]  Every empire, when it oppresses some people, brings in foreign troops to do the job.
[27:18.600 --> 27:23.600]  Of course, these will be foreign troops in our uniforms, as we told you they would.
[27:23.600 --> 27:30.600]  We went to urban warfare drills from Louisiana to California and showed you the footage of it.
[27:30.600 --> 27:39.600]  This has been a long, long program, now coming to fruition.
[27:39.600 --> 27:47.600]  So 2007 was the year, will be the year of the American Union really standing on its own two feet.
[27:47.600 --> 27:49.600]  And this will be the test of it.
[27:49.600 --> 27:52.600]  Will the American people wake up to it?
[27:52.600 --> 27:54.600]  And it's different programs.
[27:54.600 --> 28:00.600]  Will they realize how dire the situation is or will they capitulate and accept it?
[28:00.600 --> 28:07.600]  Simultaneously, in 2007, they're announcing from Indiana to Texas, from Oregon to New York,
[28:07.600 --> 28:11.600]  that foreign companies are being given.
[28:11.600 --> 28:17.600]  You really look at the deals that are being given to fire sale prices.
[28:17.600 --> 28:26.600]  The infrastructure, the ports, the roads, to be used as taxing mechanisms to fund the North American Union.
[28:26.600 --> 28:31.600]  When they seize a major interstate highway or a farm-to-market road, say in Texas,
[28:31.600 --> 28:38.600]  and place toll roads on existing roads, it is apportioned out to the city, the county, the state,
[28:38.600 --> 28:47.600]  the federal government, and then a large portion to be rolled into an SPP, Security and Prosperity Partnership funding mechanism.
[28:47.600 --> 28:52.600]  This has all been announced to even, quote, build roads in Mexico.
[28:52.600 --> 28:54.600]  This is a signed agreement.
[28:54.600 --> 28:56.600]  Congress isn't involved.
[28:56.600 --> 29:02.600]  A signed agreement between the bureaucracies of our government and the Mexican and Canadian governments
[29:02.600 --> 29:11.600]  are tax-funding and build the superhighway that goes south out of Texas down to the west coast of Mexico,
[29:11.600 --> 29:15.600]  where the Chinese goods will flow in.
[29:15.600 --> 29:24.600]  And again, everybody gets focused on the NAFTA superhighway I-35, which I am literally three miles from right where I sit.
[29:24.600 --> 29:26.600]  That is only one major artery.
[29:26.600 --> 29:30.600]  They are grabbing 82, this is in the SPP documents,
[29:30.600 --> 29:36.600]  82 existing and if you count them, there is only 85 interstate highways.
[29:36.600 --> 29:46.600]  So there is 82 others plus I-35, that is 83 of the 85 already slated to go under this
[29:46.600 --> 29:50.600]  and they are throwing toll roads down on them right now.
[29:50.600 --> 29:55.600]  And that money is going to be taken and put into the bureaucracy to fund the further dismantling.
[29:55.600 --> 30:00.600]  I mean, if they grab the infrastructure of any country, especially its roads, the heart of an infrastructure,
[30:00.600 --> 30:04.600]  then the U.S. is even worse because we are totally dependent on roads.
[30:04.600 --> 30:11.600]  And we are sprawling civilization compared to Europe or Japan.
[30:11.600 --> 30:14.600]  So it is a bloodless coup.
[30:14.600 --> 30:17.600]  The military industrial complex figured out that they could take over foreign countries,
[30:17.600 --> 30:23.600]  but why not just take over the one that funded them, the one where they grew in their own bosom?
[30:23.600 --> 30:25.600]  They are overthrowing the people.
[30:25.600 --> 30:29.600]  We are on the march, the empire is on the run.
[30:29.600 --> 30:35.600]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:35.600 --> 30:38.600]  The statistics are heart-wrenching.
[30:38.600 --> 30:42.600]  According to the CWC of the 43 million people who have served in the major wars
[30:42.600 --> 30:46.600]  from the Revolutionary War to the Gulf War, 3 million never made it home alive.
[30:46.600 --> 30:50.600]  Most likely each one of us can say we either knew someone who served
[30:50.600 --> 30:52.600]  or know a brave soul who is currently serving our country.
[30:52.600 --> 30:56.600]  Now there is a unique way to pay tribute to the courageous men and women
[30:56.600 --> 31:00.600]  who spend their lives protecting our freedom and to those who have lost their lives doing so.
[31:00.600 --> 31:06.600]  Davis Products is offering high-quality, solid-cast aluminum memorial markers for your American flag.
[31:06.600 --> 31:10.600]  Each memorial marker is specifically designed to represent one of 15 wars.
[31:10.600 --> 31:14.600]  All markers include a 3-8-inch pointed and threaded aluminum rod,
[31:14.600 --> 31:17.600]  painted and highlighted for an appearance that is unforgettable.
[31:17.600 --> 31:20.600]  What better way to pay homage to our enlisted loved ones?
[31:20.600 --> 31:23.600]  Davis Products memorial markers are only $9 a piece
[31:23.600 --> 31:27.600]  and can be ordered by calling 814-827-4946.
[31:27.600 --> 31:30.600]  That's 814-827-4946.
[31:30.600 --> 31:32.600]  Or visit davis-products.com.
[31:32.600 --> 31:35.600]  That's davis-products.com.
[31:35.600 --> 31:38.600]  It's a fact. You can legally eliminate credit card debt,
[31:38.600 --> 31:41.600]  which has been fraudulently created by the banks.
[31:41.600 --> 31:46.600]  Since its creation in 1913, the Federal Reserve has not been held responsible for its own debt.
[31:46.600 --> 31:50.600]  So why should you, the hardworking American, be harassed for yours?
[31:50.600 --> 31:53.600]  There's a double standard when it comes to being responsible for debt.
[31:53.600 --> 31:57.600]  And unlike the Federal Reserve, the people of this country can't print more money when needed.
[31:57.600 --> 32:01.600]  Day of Jubilee has created a successful program designed for people
[32:01.600 --> 32:05.600]  that want to stop harassing calls and threatening letters from bill collectors.
[32:05.600 --> 32:07.600]  We also do credit restoration.
[32:07.600 --> 32:11.600]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe a sigh of relief
[32:11.600 --> 32:14.600]  because they have legally eliminated their credit card debt.
[32:14.600 --> 32:18.600]  Instead of living each day in fear, it's time to turn your life around.
[32:18.600 --> 32:20.600]  Call Day of Jubilee.
[32:20.600 --> 32:26.600]  Open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Central Standard Time at 920-293-8024.
[32:26.600 --> 32:30.600]  That's 920-293-8024.
[32:30.600 --> 32:32.600]  And ask for Robert.
[32:32.600 --> 32:35.600]  Don't wait any longer to get your life back in order.
[32:35.600 --> 32:38.600]  Attention, attention everyone.
[32:38.600 --> 32:41.600]  A brand new invention just released.
[32:41.600 --> 32:46.600]  It's called RIST Ease, the new patented portable ergonomic wrist support.
[32:46.600 --> 32:50.600]  RIST Ease comforts your wrists from the sometimes painful tasks of typing,
[32:50.600 --> 32:53.600]  writing, using a mouse or adding machine.
[32:53.600 --> 32:57.600]  Unlike most conventional wrist pads that are either attached to a mouse pad
[32:57.600 --> 33:00.600]  or lay flat in front of your keyboard,
[33:00.600 --> 33:04.600]  RIST Ease is totally portable and ideal for laptop users
[33:04.600 --> 33:07.600]  and technicians who are constantly on the go.
[33:07.600 --> 33:11.600]  RIST Ease is perfect for children doing homework or playing video games.
[33:11.600 --> 33:15.600]  RIST Ease provides the proper comfort and support for all ages
[33:15.600 --> 33:20.600]  and RIST Ease provides comfort for victims of carpal tunnel syndrome
[33:20.600 --> 33:22.600]  and other repetitive injuries.
[33:22.600 --> 33:25.600]  You can order RIST Ease now at RIST Ease.com.
[33:25.600 --> 33:32.600]  That's RIST Ease, W-R-I-S-T-E-A-S-E, RIST Ease.com.
[33:32.600 --> 33:37.600]  Once again, RIST EASE.com.
[34:02.600 --> 34:04.600]  Someone who cares
[34:06.600 --> 34:08.600]  Your own
[34:09.600 --> 34:11.600]  Personal
[34:11.600 --> 34:13.600]  Jesus
[34:15.600 --> 34:18.600]  Someone to hear your prayers
[34:18.600 --> 34:20.600]  Someone who's there
[34:20.600 --> 34:22.600]  RIST EASE
[34:30.600 --> 34:34.600]  Feeling unknown and you're all alone
[34:34.600 --> 34:38.600]  Flashing bones by the telephone
[34:38.600 --> 34:43.600]  Lift up the receiver, I'll make you a believer
[34:43.600 --> 34:46.600]  Welcome back, thank you Johnny Cash
[34:46.600 --> 34:49.600]  Takes a second best, put me to the test
[34:49.600 --> 34:54.600]  I'll tell you right now, my friends, that I'm honored to be your host
[34:54.600 --> 34:58.600]  I'm honored to be here Monday through Friday 11 to 2 p.m. Central
[34:58.600 --> 35:01.600]  on the one and only Genesis Communications Radio Network
[35:01.600 --> 35:05.600]  I'm proud of this network and the great work it's done over the years
[35:05.600 --> 35:09.600]  I always do want to remind you, listeners, that if you hear my voice
[35:09.600 --> 35:12.600]  endorsing a product, that means I believe in it
[35:12.600 --> 35:15.600]  and I think that you should get it or that it would be helpful for you
[35:15.600 --> 35:19.600]  but it does not necessarily mean that I agree with everything else you hear
[35:19.600 --> 35:22.600]  with other sponsors or information
[35:22.600 --> 35:25.600]  and that goes two ways, that means necessarily
[35:25.600 --> 35:29.600]  some of the other shows on this network may not completely agree with the things I say or do
[35:29.600 --> 35:31.600]  or their sponsors may not agree with me
[35:31.600 --> 35:34.600]  same thing for our fine affiliates out there
[35:34.600 --> 35:38.600]  all the time I get calls or emails going, well this is on a station you're on
[35:38.600 --> 35:41.600]  you agree with that and I'm like, I'm not my brother's keeper
[35:41.600 --> 35:46.600]  I'm here doing a radio show trying to run my own life which I have a lot of trouble doing
[35:46.600 --> 35:49.600]  all right, back live here
[35:49.600 --> 35:53.600]  we're supposed to get a call in the next 10 minutes from Kevin Smith and Aaron Dykes
[35:53.600 --> 35:57.600]  they're out on the scene of the FEMA camp
[35:57.600 --> 36:00.600]  that is north of Austin in Taylor
[36:00.600 --> 36:04.600]  I talked to them about 10 minutes ago and they were arriving
[36:04.600 --> 36:08.600]  and there have been a bunch of different protests out there that were scheduled to be one there today
[36:08.600 --> 36:12.600]  and did plug info wars for coverage of it, we appreciate that
[36:12.600 --> 36:17.600]  and so we're out there physically covering it right now, I'll give you a report there
[36:17.600 --> 36:21.600]  Michael Rivera will be joining us coming up in the next hour
[36:21.600 --> 36:23.600]  we'll have open phones during an interview
[36:23.600 --> 36:26.600]  he's going to be joining us, I think he starts his first show this weekend
[36:26.600 --> 36:30.600]  I'm going to be doing a weekend show, a new show here on the Genesis Network
[36:30.600 --> 36:31.600]  we're excited about that
[36:31.600 --> 36:36.600]  and I'm going to air most of the early 1960s Twilight Zone episode
[36:36.600 --> 36:40.600]  of the Obsolete Man
[36:40.600 --> 36:44.600]  I think it's powerful, it's informative and I want to comment on it
[36:44.600 --> 36:48.600]  it's a little similar, not the whole thing but a large portion of it and comment on it and analyze it
[36:48.600 --> 36:53.600]  getting back to 2006, the year America died
[36:53.600 --> 37:00.600]  2007, the year the American Union will either stand or fall
[37:00.600 --> 37:06.600]  and I was mentioning before we ran into that break
[37:06.600 --> 37:13.600]  that it's simple, you've got big powerful global corporations
[37:13.600 --> 37:19.600]  that took over the banking system of England in 1801
[37:19.600 --> 37:24.600]  and really you submitted that control in 1806
[37:24.600 --> 37:28.600]  they took over the Dutch banking system there shortly thereafter
[37:28.600 --> 37:31.600]  they took over the French banking system before that
[37:31.600 --> 37:35.600]  they took over our banking system entirely in 1913
[37:35.600 --> 37:38.600]  and so you have a few private families
[37:38.600 --> 37:45.600]  the Saxe-Coburg gothers, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, the Warburgs
[37:45.600 --> 37:47.600]  there's less than 20 families
[37:47.600 --> 37:50.600]  and they own the private stock in the central banks
[37:50.600 --> 37:53.600]  and if your country doesn't have their central banking control on it
[37:53.600 --> 37:58.600]  they will hop up some reason or fund rebels or run a coup d'etat
[37:58.600 --> 38:01.600]  and come blow your capital up or do whatever they have to do
[38:01.600 --> 38:04.600]  or poison your water supply or stage terror attacks and blame it on you
[38:04.600 --> 38:11.600]  and they'll come in and take over your nation
[38:11.600 --> 38:15.600]  and they use the US from 1913 on as an engine
[38:15.600 --> 38:18.600]  to fund the Soviets, to fund the Nazis, to build up threats
[38:18.600 --> 38:23.600]  to then knock down the threats, they always financed both sides
[38:23.600 --> 38:25.600]  and then now they decided to use the US up
[38:25.600 --> 38:27.600]  like they did Germany and the Soviet Union
[38:27.600 --> 38:29.600]  they've got us out doing their wicked work
[38:29.600 --> 38:33.600]  while owning the media that tells people domestically that we're doing a good job
[38:33.600 --> 38:36.600]  while the very media, the globalist zone, oversees demonizes us
[38:36.600 --> 38:38.600]  and blames Americans for everything
[38:38.600 --> 38:39.600]  but we're just their puppets
[38:39.600 --> 38:42.600]  I want to make that clear to the world listening
[38:42.600 --> 38:45.600]  okay, you cannot entirely blame the United States for this
[38:45.600 --> 38:48.600]  you can blame us for being slovenly, lazy, uninformed
[38:48.600 --> 38:52.600]  but milk and honey does that to any people
[38:52.600 --> 38:55.600]  I'd like to see some other nation that's been on top for hundreds of years
[38:55.600 --> 39:00.600]  and not see them turn into a bunch of decadent scum
[39:00.600 --> 39:02.600]  there's still a lot of good people in this country
[39:02.600 --> 39:05.600]  I don't appreciate those out there, badmouth in the US
[39:05.600 --> 39:08.600]  I don't appreciate the liberals in the UN
[39:08.600 --> 39:10.600]  who are part of the false left-right system
[39:10.600 --> 39:12.600]  and the false bipolar dichotomy
[39:12.600 --> 39:17.600]  claiming that America did all this, Noam Chomsky and the rest of those people
[39:17.600 --> 39:20.600]  MIT, government paycheck boy
[39:20.600 --> 39:23.600]  always blaming the US like the US is the elite
[39:23.600 --> 39:26.600]  the US is the foot soldier of the New World Order
[39:26.600 --> 39:31.600]  a capo at best
[39:31.600 --> 39:33.600]  same thing goes for England
[39:33.600 --> 39:39.600]  a good, virtuous, hard-working people that ended slavery worldwide
[39:39.600 --> 39:42.600]  black slavery
[39:42.600 --> 39:45.600]  the ideas of common law grew and developed
[39:45.600 --> 39:47.600]  out of the law of Mount Sinai
[39:47.600 --> 39:49.600]  and were perfected
[39:49.600 --> 39:50.600]  and were brought forward
[39:50.600 --> 39:53.600]  and it was almost half the people in the House of Commons
[39:53.600 --> 39:57.600]  that supported the US in its founding
[40:01.600 --> 40:03.600]  don't blame England
[40:03.600 --> 40:06.600]  we have been hijacked because we have the force of arms
[40:06.600 --> 40:07.600]  we have the wealth
[40:07.600 --> 40:11.600]  we have the virtuous, informed, dynamic populations
[40:11.600 --> 40:14.600]  so of course the parasites came in
[40:14.600 --> 40:16.600]  and got control of our central nervous systems
[40:16.600 --> 40:19.600]  our central governments expanded the power of the central government
[40:19.600 --> 40:22.600]  the globalists come into countries that get control of the central government
[40:22.600 --> 40:25.600]  then they expand the power of the central government
[40:25.600 --> 40:27.600]  once they seize full control of a nation
[40:27.600 --> 40:32.600]  they then turn it as an engine of warfare to dominate other nations
[40:32.600 --> 40:34.600]  once they take those countries over
[40:34.600 --> 40:38.600]  they then turn them into engines to dominate their neighbors
[40:38.600 --> 40:44.600]  or if it's an imperial power to project the power
[40:44.600 --> 40:51.600]  out of their own geographic regional configuration
[40:51.600 --> 40:52.600]  so it's real simple
[40:52.600 --> 40:53.600]  private interests took over the US
[40:53.600 --> 40:55.600]  they took over our military industrial complex
[40:55.600 --> 40:57.600]  they grew it with our tax money
[40:57.600 --> 41:02.600]  into the greatest colossal militarily ever seen on this planet
[41:02.600 --> 41:05.600]  and they are now in the final stages of debasing our currency
[41:05.600 --> 41:08.600]  trying to buy up the world by printing the dollar
[41:08.600 --> 41:10.600]  just until it's worth almost nothing
[41:10.600 --> 41:13.600]  then they've now taken dollars, made foreign investments
[41:13.600 --> 41:15.600]  they shift those dollars into foreign currencies
[41:15.600 --> 41:18.600]  and come back and buy up what infrastructure
[41:18.600 --> 41:21.600]  and what ideas and what companies and what structures
[41:21.600 --> 41:23.600]  are left here domestically
[41:23.600 --> 41:27.600]  it's always a shifting, a central feudal black hole
[41:27.600 --> 41:30.600]  destroying middle classes, destroying independence
[41:30.600 --> 41:33.600]  destroying family, always monopolizing
[41:33.600 --> 41:38.600]  these are monopoly men
[41:38.600 --> 41:42.600]  it's what they do, it's all they do
[41:42.600 --> 41:43.600]  so we're going to start about beating them
[41:43.600 --> 41:45.600]  we have to admit who they are
[41:45.600 --> 41:47.600]  the new world order crime syndicate
[41:47.600 --> 41:49.600]  we have to name them
[41:49.600 --> 41:52.600]  we have to expose their programs and their operations
[41:52.600 --> 41:54.600]  and then people on the left and the right
[41:54.600 --> 41:57.600]  can wake up and see that both parties are controlled
[41:57.600 --> 42:00.600]  they'll have us fight over petty football issues
[42:00.600 --> 42:02.600]  petty issues that at the end of the day
[42:02.600 --> 42:06.600]  will never be decided or don't matter to begin with
[42:06.600 --> 42:09.600]  people can then see how Hillary and Bush
[42:09.600 --> 42:11.600]  are on the same page on every real issue
[42:11.600 --> 42:15.600]  they're moving forward against us
[42:15.600 --> 42:17.600]  I mean how can I have tens of thousands
[42:17.600 --> 42:19.600]  of what you'd call classical liberals
[42:19.600 --> 42:21.600]  around the country who are anti-gun
[42:21.600 --> 42:23.600]  out buying guns
[42:23.600 --> 42:27.600]  they didn't give up their peace position
[42:27.600 --> 42:30.600]  they now realize that it is a position of strength
[42:30.600 --> 42:34.600]  that will give us domestic peace
[42:34.600 --> 42:36.600]  why do we have the left out there now
[42:36.600 --> 42:38.600]  realizing the environmental movement
[42:38.600 --> 42:40.600]  has been totally taken over by big corporations
[42:40.600 --> 42:43.600]  and has used as a front to steal private property
[42:43.600 --> 42:47.600]  because we don't sit here like a bunch of political whores
[42:47.600 --> 42:50.600]  making excuses for the republican party
[42:50.600 --> 42:55.600]  which is a pack of villainous vermin
[42:55.600 --> 42:57.600]  conversely we have conservatives
[42:57.600 --> 42:59.600]  listening to this program
[42:59.600 --> 43:02.600]  because they know we're just covering the issues
[43:02.600 --> 43:04.600]  and we can demonstrate to them that George Bush
[43:04.600 --> 43:08.600]  is no conservative
[43:08.600 --> 43:11.600]  you see they want to keep you in that left right debate
[43:11.600 --> 43:13.600]  which is false
[43:13.600 --> 43:15.600]  and while you're busy clawing each other's eyes out
[43:15.600 --> 43:20.600]  the elite moves forward
[43:20.600 --> 43:22.600]  just like our government for 50 years
[43:22.600 --> 43:25.600]  has funded textbooks and comic books
[43:25.600 --> 43:27.600]  in Mexico through the Ford Foundation
[43:27.600 --> 43:30.600]  with 24 billion dollars in its coffers
[43:30.600 --> 43:32.600]  to say the southwest belongs to Mexico
[43:32.600 --> 43:34.600]  break up the country fight with each other
[43:34.600 --> 43:38.600]  they want us fighting with each other
[43:38.600 --> 43:41.600]  frankly if that LaRica and Quista idea
[43:41.600 --> 43:43.600]  hadn't been engineered into all the illegal aliens
[43:43.600 --> 43:46.600]  I wouldn't be that opposed to having 30 million of them up here
[43:46.600 --> 43:53.600]  but the globalists set it up for divide and conquer
[43:53.600 --> 43:55.600]  because before they merge countries completely
[43:55.600 --> 43:57.600]  they first have ethnic strife
[43:57.600 --> 44:01.600]  to then balkanize the original governments
[44:01.600 --> 44:10.600]  to weaken them and then roll that into a larger structure
[44:10.600 --> 44:12.600]  so it's simple
[44:12.600 --> 44:14.600]  the military industrial complex
[44:14.600 --> 44:19.600]  that funds 90 plus percent of university research
[44:19.600 --> 44:21.600]  owns our schools, owns our media
[44:21.600 --> 44:24.600]  it itself is owned by the private banking families
[44:24.600 --> 44:26.600]  and they just took over the US
[44:26.600 --> 44:29.600]  like they took over every other major country
[44:29.600 --> 44:33.600]  there's a handful of nations left that aren't under their control
[44:33.600 --> 44:36.600]  a handful
[44:36.600 --> 44:40.600]  you could count it on two hands
[44:40.600 --> 44:43.600]  and they'll show you the problems of those countries
[44:43.600 --> 44:45.600]  the bad leaders of those countries
[44:45.600 --> 44:46.600]  I'm not debating that
[44:46.600 --> 44:48.600]  and then they'll say oh see we should go take them over
[44:48.600 --> 44:50.600]  because they're bad
[44:50.600 --> 44:52.600]  the good the bad the ugly
[44:52.600 --> 44:53.600]  that doesn't matter
[44:53.600 --> 44:57.600]  the point is they're not under the global crime syndicates control
[44:57.600 --> 44:59.600]  so they're a threat to it period
[44:59.600 --> 45:03.600]  and those countries do not threaten you those rogue nations
[45:03.600 --> 45:05.600]  some of them do to a certain extent
[45:05.600 --> 45:07.600]  because our government armed them
[45:07.600 --> 45:09.600]  like North Korea and China
[45:09.600 --> 45:13.600]  the best enemies money can buy
[45:13.600 --> 45:18.600]  you have Kevin on the line
[45:18.600 --> 45:20.600]  but he can't come on quite yet
[45:20.600 --> 45:21.600]  why because he's
[45:21.600 --> 45:23.600]  you'll tell me at the break
[45:23.600 --> 45:25.600]  what he's interviewing people
[45:25.600 --> 45:27.600]  I mean I knew this would happen
[45:27.600 --> 45:31.600]  he's out there at the little FEMA camp
[45:31.600 --> 45:36.600]  and well he may come on then while Rivera's on with us
[45:36.600 --> 45:41.600]  I don't know
[45:41.600 --> 45:48.600]  all right
[45:48.600 --> 45:52.600]  so
[45:52.600 --> 45:54.600]  we need to look at who this elite are
[45:54.600 --> 45:55.600]  what have they done in the past
[45:55.600 --> 45:56.600]  who have they funded
[45:56.600 --> 45:57.600]  what is their modus operandi
[45:57.600 --> 45:59.600]  what's their signature
[45:59.600 --> 46:00.600]  what's their wavelength
[46:00.600 --> 46:02.600]  where they coming from
[46:02.600 --> 46:04.600]  they enjoy enslavement
[46:04.600 --> 46:06.600]  they enjoy dumbing you down
[46:06.600 --> 46:07.600]  they enjoy taking everything you've got
[46:07.600 --> 46:10.600]  they are threatened by any independence
[46:10.600 --> 46:13.600]  of any type anywhere
[46:13.600 --> 46:14.600]  they condition you
[46:14.600 --> 46:15.600]  they brainwash you
[46:15.600 --> 46:16.600]  they dumb you down
[46:16.600 --> 46:18.600]  they train our women and our men
[46:18.600 --> 46:20.600]  to fight with each other
[46:20.600 --> 46:22.600]  north against south
[46:22.600 --> 46:23.600]  east against west
[46:23.600 --> 46:24.600]  woman against man
[46:24.600 --> 46:25.600]  child against parents
[46:25.600 --> 46:27.600]  black against white
[46:27.600 --> 46:29.600]  white against Hispanic
[46:29.600 --> 46:32.600]  Chinese against Vietnamese
[46:32.600 --> 46:35.600]  against Japanese
[46:35.600 --> 46:37.600]  black tribe against the tribe
[46:37.600 --> 46:38.600]  across the river
[46:38.600 --> 46:43.600]  Catholic against Protestant
[46:43.600 --> 46:44.600]  and while everybody's busy
[46:44.600 --> 46:46.600]  fighting with each other
[46:46.600 --> 46:52.600]  they move forward
[46:52.600 --> 46:57.600]  so this will be the year
[46:57.600 --> 47:01.600]  make or break it
[47:01.600 --> 47:03.600]  it's like fourth and five
[47:03.600 --> 47:10.600]  sudden death over time
[47:10.600 --> 47:12.600]  and we are having successes
[47:12.600 --> 47:13.600]  the globalists are being more
[47:13.600 --> 47:14.600]  revealed than ever
[47:14.600 --> 47:16.600]  they are more hated than ever
[47:16.600 --> 47:18.600]  again 84% of Americans
[47:18.600 --> 47:20.600]  do not trust either political party now
[47:20.600 --> 47:21.600]  we've never seen a number like that
[47:21.600 --> 47:23.600]  anything near that impulse
[47:23.600 --> 47:25.600]  so they've blown their cover
[47:25.600 --> 47:26.600]  and we always said
[47:26.600 --> 47:28.600]  that would be our key opportunity
[47:28.600 --> 47:29.600]  to wake up as many as we could
[47:29.600 --> 47:31.600]  before the North American Union was formed
[47:31.600 --> 47:34.600]  before the government staged more terror
[47:34.600 --> 47:37.600]  before we got deep into end game
[47:37.600 --> 47:38.600]  that's what FEMA by the way
[47:38.600 --> 47:40.600]  calls all these camps they're building
[47:40.600 --> 47:41.600]  that's been the Houston Chronicle
[47:41.600 --> 47:42.600]  they call it end game
[47:42.600 --> 47:44.600]  the program is called end game
[47:44.600 --> 47:46.600]  before we got into end game
[47:46.600 --> 47:49.600]  to wake up as many as we could
[47:49.600 --> 47:51.600]  so that when we went into end game
[47:51.600 --> 47:53.600]  we would have the educated informed
[47:53.600 --> 47:56.600]  motivated cadres
[47:56.600 --> 47:58.600]  operating as lone wolf groups
[47:58.600 --> 48:00.600]  across the nation and the world
[48:00.600 --> 48:03.600]  to organize even larger resistance
[48:03.600 --> 48:06.600]  once it became clear to the average sheep
[48:06.600 --> 48:09.600]  the average sheeple
[48:09.600 --> 48:10.600]  and now we're there
[48:10.600 --> 48:11.600]  they are waking up
[48:11.600 --> 48:13.600]  they still don't know the full scope
[48:13.600 --> 48:15.600]  they don't have a geopolitical gauge
[48:15.600 --> 48:17.600]  but they know things are corrupt
[48:17.600 --> 48:18.600]  they sense things are bad
[48:18.600 --> 48:20.600]  they now know America's dying
[48:20.600 --> 48:23.600]  they don't know it's dead
[48:23.600 --> 48:26.600]  they know that they're being lied to
[48:26.600 --> 48:28.600]  they know they're being lied to about 9-11
[48:28.600 --> 48:30.600]  they know the war is a lie
[48:30.600 --> 48:32.600]  I mean what better example
[48:32.600 --> 48:34.600]  millions of signatures sign
[48:34.600 --> 48:38.600]  in different positions for impeachment of Bush
[48:38.600 --> 48:41.600]  he's a puppet but it's important to punish him
[48:41.600 --> 48:44.600]  because it sends a message to this government
[48:44.600 --> 48:48.600]  to both sides that the people will punish you
[48:48.600 --> 48:50.600]  that if you follow the orders of the globalists
[48:50.600 --> 48:52.600]  you will get in trouble
[48:52.600 --> 48:54.600]  and it's a message to the world
[48:54.600 --> 49:01.600]  that we don't condone what America has been used for
[49:01.600 --> 49:07.600]  it's very important
[49:07.600 --> 49:12.600]  78% of Americans in indexed polls want us out of Iraq
[49:12.600 --> 49:15.600]  70% of the troops
[49:15.600 --> 49:16.600]  what's their answer?
[49:16.600 --> 49:19.600]  Bush has announced that they are going to expand
[49:19.600 --> 49:21.600]  the number of the troops is going to give a speech today or tomorrow
[49:21.600 --> 49:22.600]  they're saying
[49:22.600 --> 49:24.600]  and they are now announcing
[49:24.600 --> 49:28.600]  well here I have the BBC right here
[49:28.600 --> 49:30.600]  they are now announcing that of course
[49:30.600 --> 49:37.600]  they were never going to train 44 brigades of Iraqi National Guard
[49:37.600 --> 49:38.600]  of course that was never going to work
[49:38.600 --> 49:39.600]  they never wanted that to work
[49:39.600 --> 49:43.600]  they disbanded their military immediately
[49:43.600 --> 49:46.600]  all the top generals and statisticians said don't disband them
[49:46.600 --> 49:47.600]  it'll be endless civil war
[49:47.600 --> 49:48.600]  well of course they did
[49:48.600 --> 49:50.600]  they won endless civil war
[49:50.600 --> 49:51.600]  so now they're backing away from that fraud
[49:51.600 --> 49:55.600]  and just saying no it's going to be more US troops
[49:55.600 --> 49:57.600]  Bush will reveal Iraq troop boost
[49:57.600 --> 49:59.600]  US President George W. Bush
[49:59.600 --> 50:02.600]  intends to reveal a new Iraq strategy within days
[50:02.600 --> 50:04.600]  the BBC has learned
[50:04.600 --> 50:05.600]  the speech will reveal
[50:05.600 --> 50:08.600]  a plan to send more US troops to Iraq
[50:08.600 --> 50:10.600]  to focus on ways of bringing greater security
[50:10.600 --> 50:15.600]  rather than training Iraqi forces
[50:15.600 --> 50:18.600]  the move comes with figures from Iraqi ministers
[50:18.600 --> 50:22.600]  suggesting that deaths among civilians are at record highs
[50:22.600 --> 50:26.600]  and there isn't one trained brigade
[50:26.600 --> 50:28.600]  or even smaller unit of a brigade
[50:28.600 --> 50:31.600]  that is in combat order
[50:31.600 --> 50:34.600]  that is non-US
[50:34.600 --> 50:35.600]  and the British are downsizing
[50:35.600 --> 50:37.600]  the Spanish have pulled out
[50:37.600 --> 50:39.600]  the Poles pulled out a long time ago
[50:39.600 --> 50:41.600]  the US President arrived back in Washington today
[50:41.600 --> 50:46.600]  after a week long holiday at his ranch in Texas
[50:46.600 --> 50:48.600]  the BBC was told by senior administration
[50:48.600 --> 50:50.600]  source that the speech setting out changes
[50:50.600 --> 50:52.600]  in Mr. Bush's Iraq policy
[50:52.600 --> 50:55.600]  is likely to come in the middle of next week
[50:55.600 --> 50:59.600]  its central theme will be sacrifice
[50:59.600 --> 51:00.600]  the speech the BBC has been told
[51:00.600 --> 51:03.600]  involves increasing troop numbers
[51:03.600 --> 51:06.600]  and increasing profits for defense contractors
[51:06.600 --> 51:08.600]  I would add
[51:08.600 --> 51:11.600]  the exact mission of the extra troops in Iraq
[51:11.600 --> 51:14.600]  is still unclear
[51:14.600 --> 51:15.600]  according to officials
[51:15.600 --> 51:17.600]  but its likely to focus on providing security
[51:17.600 --> 51:19.600]  rather than training Iraqi forces
[51:19.600 --> 51:22.600]  they never meant to train them
[51:22.600 --> 51:24.600]  it was meant to fail
[51:24.600 --> 51:26.600]  it was meant to be a black hole
[51:26.600 --> 51:28.600]  a tar baby
[51:28.600 --> 51:30.600]  we'll be right back
[51:30.600 --> 51:33.600]  stay with me
[51:38.600 --> 51:40.600]  its year after a year in production
[51:40.600 --> 51:42.600]  and traveling to different lands
[51:42.600 --> 51:44.600]  my new film terror storm is complete
[51:44.600 --> 51:46.600]  shocking declassified government documents prove
[51:46.600 --> 51:48.600]  that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks
[51:48.600 --> 51:50.600]  against their own populations
[51:50.600 --> 51:52.600]  as a pretext to enslave them
[51:52.600 --> 51:54.600]  terror storm proves that not only was 9-11
[51:54.600 --> 51:56.600]  an inside job
[51:56.600 --> 51:58.600]  but the attacks of 7-7 in London
[51:58.600 --> 52:00.600]  were carried out by British intelligence
[52:00.600 --> 52:03.600]  terror storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran
[52:03.600 --> 52:06.600]  a White House program to disseminate fake news
[52:06.600 --> 52:08.600]  NSA spy, secret police torture
[52:08.600 --> 52:10.600]  the latest 9-11 information
[52:10.600 --> 52:12.600]  and much much more
[52:12.600 --> 52:14.600]  terror storm is the definitive guide
[52:14.600 --> 52:16.600]  to the history of government sponsored terrorism
[52:16.600 --> 52:18.600]  its an anthology of government crimes
