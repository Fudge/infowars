[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government coverups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:34.000]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:34.000 --> 00:39.880]  we've got another big broadcast lined up for you today thank you so much for
[00:39.880 --> 00:47.480]  joining us it is Thursday the fifth day of January 2012 we're almost through the
[00:47.480 --> 00:53.120]  work week of the first week of the new year before you know it'll be 2013 and
[00:53.120 --> 00:56.360]  all those folks that said it was going to be the end of the world they're gonna
[00:56.360 --> 01:03.040]  look pretty silly I hope they turn out to be wrong we've got US troops deploying
[01:03.040 --> 01:09.720]  Jerusalem Post is calling it not not a exercise but a deployment to Israel and
[01:09.720 --> 01:14.880]  I've got a whole stack of newspaper articles saying it's in preparation for
[01:14.880 --> 01:22.720]  what could be a US Israel joint strike on Iran and Iran of course in the last
[01:22.720 --> 01:27.160]  two days repeatedly has said if your aircraft carriers come back through the
[01:27.160 --> 01:32.760]  Strait of Hormuz which is international waters it's Saudi Arabia on one side
[01:32.760 --> 01:36.320]  Iran on the other for a few miles but it's 12 miles and it's it's shortest
[01:36.320 --> 01:40.200]  point there's about I don't know eight miles or so through the middle if you
[01:40.200 --> 01:44.240]  come through those waters so this you're not gonna like what happens this is
[01:44.240 --> 01:51.680]  your only warning so Iran is I guess beginning to realize that it may be a
[01:51.680 --> 01:57.080]  foregone conclusion that they're gonna be attacked and or they're crazy I mean
[01:57.080 --> 02:01.640]  I go back to if we ought to repull this because I keep mentioning it headline
[02:01.640 --> 02:06.520]  head of Iranian intelligence says he will take war to streets of Tel Aviv
[02:06.520 --> 02:11.640]  and I was impressed TV Jerusalem Post but the official Iranian news agency
[02:11.640 --> 02:16.600]  said that a few months ago and I mean when I saw it it was so there's such a
[02:16.600 --> 02:20.880]  dangerous statement that I had to go and make sure the Iranians actually said
[02:20.880 --> 02:25.000]  it because the media has exaggerated things and and blown things out of
[02:25.000 --> 02:30.160]  proportion on occasion with the Iranians to make the case for war look good and
[02:30.160 --> 02:33.520]  he didn't just say he'd attack Tel Aviv they said we'll also take it to the
[02:33.520 --> 02:42.480]  United States and your major cities that is asking that is begging to have the
[02:42.480 --> 02:48.200]  West attack you and then if Iran does activate some type of sleeper cells that
[02:48.200 --> 02:52.400]  plays right into the government's hands while they implode the economy while
[02:52.400 --> 02:57.600]  they bring in all this tyranny while they set up all these TSA checkpoints
[02:57.600 --> 03:02.040]  that they've tripled the funding for this year they passed it last year the
[03:02.040 --> 03:06.800]  NDA the arrest of citizens this whole military industrial complex takeover
[03:06.800 --> 03:13.760]  is aided massively by a war with Iran and if Iran responds with that with
[03:13.760 --> 03:20.160]  asymmetrical warfare here in the United States and yes there is the report
[03:20.160 --> 03:25.880]  Iran threatened street war in Tel Aviv Iran has threatened a street war in
[03:25.880 --> 03:30.760]  Tel Aviv and in the US and Europe should its nuclear sites be targeted please
[03:30.760 --> 03:36.200]  print that for me thank you I think that was a Iranian official government news
[03:36.200 --> 03:39.520]  source but I couldn't read the fine print so just all I'll have that after
[03:39.520 --> 03:47.720]  the break once they've printed it for me now continuing along those lines we're
[03:47.720 --> 03:53.600]  gonna break all this down more after the break DHS offers officers armed with

[06:16.440 --> 06:20.760]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[06:20.760 --> 06:25.120]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[06:25.120 --> 06:28.880]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[06:28.880 --> 06:33.000]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[06:33.000 --> 06:36.960]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[06:36.960 --> 06:40.800]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[06:40.800 --> 06:43.520]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution from

[08:32.240 --> 08:38.560]  quickening the climax for its global conflict open-world government being
[08:38.560 --> 08:44.520]  established by the big six megabanks open police state dictatorships crack down
[08:44.520 --> 08:48.400]  on free speech in Europe the United States Canada Australia New Zealand it

[08:54.400 --> 08:59.920]  controllers are attempting a strategy of hiding in plain view they're not
[08:59.920 --> 09:04.720]  sneaking around behind the scenes constructing their new world order and
[09:04.720 --> 09:10.600]  their technological terrors they are now openly flaunting them because they're
[09:10.600 --> 09:18.000]  entering a phase of open deployment war checkpoints military on the streets
[09:18.000 --> 09:23.600]  political dissidents being arrested now they are announcing all of this so that
[09:23.600 --> 09:30.000]  people that are intelligent informed get scared if you buy into the fear and
[09:30.000 --> 09:37.320]  stop exercising your free speech and bow to these people it's over the good
[09:37.320 --> 09:45.840]  news is this is so outrageous that even people that work for ABC Fox CNN comedy
[09:45.840 --> 09:50.440]  central the Daily Show are coming out and saying this is really horrible
[09:50.440 --> 09:56.000]  Obama is really bad this is super creepy in fact I forgot to tell the guys let's
[09:56.000 --> 10:00.760]  up play some clips layer of that the Daily Show that you showed me jaren from
[10:00.760 --> 10:06.080]  Tuesday night showed to me yesterday where they be a breakdown the nuances
[10:06.080 --> 10:12.040]  the multi-layers of Obama's deception you can go watch our breakdown of it hours
[10:12.040 --> 10:16.760]  after he signed it last Saturday night on December 31st it's now got over a
[10:16.760 --> 10:21.200]  400,000 views it should have 10 million views but it's titled Obama signs
[10:21.200 --> 10:26.400]  martial law bill but I have a new video coming out that will post about an hour
[10:26.400 --> 10:30.560]  at info wars.com we're going to premiere it here for radio slash prison
[10:30.560 --> 10:37.480]  planet TV viewers this detailed full spectrum analysis of the NDAA that
[10:37.480 --> 10:43.160]  Aaron Dykes and I put together again Aaron just does a superlative job with
[10:43.160 --> 10:49.680]  these video reports we do his videos are undoubtedly the the the most popular
[10:49.680 --> 10:55.800]  that we put out but the entire crew is just excelling with what they're doing
[10:55.800 --> 11:00.040]  and we are moving to hire some more video editors and more reporters and
[11:00.040 --> 11:04.200]  moving more and more people into host positions I intend to once I officially
[11:04.200 --> 11:09.520]  forge the nightly news into the weapon against the globalist where we're
[11:09.520 --> 11:16.120]  smithing it right now and there in the Festus or Vulcan volcano if you're a
[11:16.120 --> 11:19.000]  new listener I'm not talking about Vulcans on Star Trek you know the Vulcan
[11:19.000 --> 11:23.600]  is the god the Roman god of forging weapons I guess called Festus by the
[11:23.600 --> 11:29.920]  Greeks and just like Jupiter is the Roman name of the Greek god Zeus but I
[11:29.920 --> 11:35.360]  now digress for the New York Times writes an article saying that I actually
[11:35.360 --> 11:40.800]  you know believe that we're Vulcans now the point is we are forging and beta
[11:40.800 --> 11:45.000]  testing the nightly news and when it's done the next three four months and we
[11:45.000 --> 11:50.240]  start deploying it towards television systems not just a prison planet TV and
[11:50.240 --> 11:54.360]  then where we put it on the web for millions a week we will then also start
[11:54.360 --> 11:59.400]  trying to start some other news shows maybe some weekly special reports there's
[11:59.400 --> 12:05.240]  a lot we want to do here thanks to your support
[12:05.400 --> 12:13.720]  if I sound a bit hesitant from time to time today I told the story I guess
[12:13.720 --> 12:19.840]  Tuesday of house Saturday I was at the gym trying to do high repetition weight
[12:19.840 --> 12:23.800]  lifting to try to lose weight and tone you know to really get in the gym and
[12:23.800 --> 12:26.760]  lose some weight as you can see I am losing quite a bit of weight it's up to
[12:26.760 --> 12:32.440]  25 pounds down the last month and a half and because I'm you know committed to
[12:32.440 --> 12:35.720]  take the radio show to the next level the TV show to get my health in order
[12:35.720 --> 12:41.480]  try to get closer to God you know everything in 2012 to up our game but
[12:41.480 --> 12:49.080]  when you first don't succeed try try again I was lifting weights and trying to
[12:49.080 --> 12:55.160]  go for 30 reps with just 120 pounds on incline and I was it was tough to get it
[12:55.160 --> 13:00.200]  up you know and so those final reps so I exploded and I guess my hands were tired
[13:00.200 --> 13:03.800]  because it was the last exercise I was doing at the gym was you know five sets
[13:03.800 --> 13:10.120]  of 20 to 30 reps on the incline and it just came out of my hands and before I
[13:10.120 --> 13:14.600]  could even think to try to catch it it came out of my hands and fell on my
[13:14.600 --> 13:19.400]  chest and I thought it felt like a horse had kicked me I've heard those
[13:19.400 --> 13:23.760]  descriptions of a horse kicking it was it was probably ten times the pain of you
[13:23.760 --> 13:26.880]  know when you're a kid and somebody jumps on your stomach or punches you in the
[13:26.880 --> 13:29.800]  stomach in the bread basket you can't breathe for 30 seconds it was more like
[13:29.800 --> 13:33.520]  a minute and a half I thought I was dying I got the weight off my chest went
[13:33.520 --> 13:37.320]  outside people are kind of looking at me went out the side door leaning against
[13:37.320 --> 13:40.400]  the wall to about a minute they'm able to get air and I was like am I gonna die
[13:40.400 --> 13:44.400]  did I break something I was just I was like imagine what a really a serious
[13:44.400 --> 13:48.040]  car wrecks like when you smash all your ribs because this was nothing compared to
[13:48.040 --> 13:51.360]  something like a car wreck what I've seen other people go through and finally I
[13:51.360 --> 13:54.800]  got air in my lungs and I went back in I thought maybe if I just do some light
[13:54.800 --> 13:59.640]  back exercises over here because it was also hurt my back because it compressed
[13:59.640 --> 14:04.200]  my entire rib cage you'd hurt in the front and in my spine in the back I
[14:04.200 --> 14:07.520]  thought maybe if I do some you know light weights and I couldn't even do
[14:07.520 --> 14:16.520]  that and I went home felt a lot better took some Advil and I am when I hadn't
[14:16.520 --> 14:22.520]  jogged and my dad came over and he's a dentist but he took a basic anatomy and
[14:22.520 --> 14:26.440]  he felt he said yeah I can feel it move a bit it's it's it's cracked a lot he
[14:26.440 --> 14:29.840]  said that's gonna really hurt in four or five days when it starts to heal your
[14:29.840 --> 14:34.040]  body's not gonna want you to be moving around and try to form a cast and so
[14:34.040 --> 14:37.640]  unless you lay in a bed for a month that's gonna get really painful boy is
[14:37.640 --> 14:42.400]  he right it is now gotten to the point where I have to make my shelf go through
[14:42.400 --> 14:49.200]  pain to breathe deep or it's like this asthma like or anxiety attack like
[14:49.200 --> 14:54.760]  feeling of not being able to breathe it's really weird so if you just see me
[14:54.760 --> 15:00.200]  breathing deep I'm not doing Buddhist meditation I am just trying to breathe
[15:00.200 --> 15:05.480]  here I can't imagine I remember my grandmother I was living with them for
[15:05.480 --> 15:08.400]  a year because I've gotten to so much trouble and is a sophomore in high
[15:08.400 --> 15:12.680]  school and I was just out of school basically for you that's why I was in
[15:12.680 --> 15:16.200]  high school for five years and I was there when she got the call from a
[15:16.200 --> 15:21.840]  biopsy that she had lung cancer and I remember her going well that's it I've
[15:21.840 --> 15:26.480]  got lung cancer and then I remember her all healthy happy you know beautiful I
[15:26.480 --> 15:30.080]  remember a few weeks later she gets that surgery they cut part of her lung
[15:30.080 --> 15:34.680]  out and it you know ends up basically paralyzing part of her face for a while
[15:34.680 --> 15:38.760]  nerve problems probably caused a small stroke and then that causing you know
[15:38.760 --> 15:44.240]  many years of her degenerating down till she died that I remember living with
[15:44.240 --> 15:48.360]  her for a few months and I moved back to Dallas after she had that and I remember
[15:48.360 --> 15:53.640]  her sitting there and just going and then not saying why she was doing a
[15:53.640 --> 15:57.440]  breathing in real slow and just sitting there with a cup of coffee and then I'm
[15:57.440 --> 16:01.040]  and then later I was asked her she said oh it's just excruciating to even
[16:01.040 --> 16:03.080]  breathe but you have to make yourself breathe
[16:03.080 --> 16:09.240]  imagine that like a hundred times the pain I'm in right now that people go
[16:09.240 --> 16:12.760]  through when they're in car wrecks or they have where they have the lung
[16:12.760 --> 16:18.400]  lung lung or heart surgery I was talking to Marcos Morales one of our great
[16:18.400 --> 16:22.960]  video editors here for the nightly news and graphics people who's talking about
[16:22.960 --> 16:27.760]  his dad had triple bypass open-heart surgery and he said that you know just
[16:27.760 --> 16:32.200]  for months if he just breathing was torture and I was just thinking about
[16:32.200 --> 16:40.160]  you better enjoy your life now because every moment is a precious moment in
[16:40.160 --> 16:48.440]  your life every moment is wonderful and and enjoy when you're healthy enjoy
[16:48.440 --> 16:56.160]  when you're not an excruciating pain enjoy the good times in life it's like
[16:56.160 --> 17:03.280]  that car song about let the good times roll and America is a great country full
[17:03.280 --> 17:07.400]  of wonderful people the world is a wonderful planet full of great people
[17:07.400 --> 17:14.560]  so much beauty so much art so many good things so many innocent things to defend
[17:14.560 --> 17:20.120]  and you're not gonna escape pain in this life you're not gonna escape conflict
[17:20.120 --> 17:26.440]  you're not going to escape it we all need to face our fear we all need to
[17:26.440 --> 17:33.160]  get to that point and basically prepare ourselves for the struggles that are
[17:33.160 --> 17:37.160]  coming in life whether it's children that get sick or children that die they
[17:37.160 --> 17:44.240]  say that's the worst thing in the world or brain cancer or car wrecks or
[17:44.240 --> 17:51.800]  whatever it is but then you see the globalist on the other side of that
[17:51.800 --> 18:00.040]  equation they enjoy the pain they don't just not have feelings for others they
[18:00.040 --> 18:07.400]  hate life and they hate innocence and they revel in horrifying people they
[18:07.400 --> 18:13.880]  they revel in terrorizing women and children they get off on just heartable
[18:13.880 --> 18:20.040]  abominations and it's up to us that that that can recognize good from evil to
[18:20.040 --> 18:24.880]  protect the general public who is sheep like and has been basically brought up
[18:24.880 --> 18:28.880]  in a coma-like state watching television in this culture of death who have no
[18:28.880 --> 18:32.320]  idea what's happening to them it's up to us to not be angry at him and be
[18:32.320 --> 18:35.880]  cynical and call them stupid sheeple and stuff like I've done a thousand times
[18:35.880 --> 18:42.200]  it's really up to us to reach out to them and realize how sad they are but the
[18:42.200 --> 18:48.720]  unbelievable evil of injecting children worldwide with live cancer viruses HIV
[18:48.720 --> 18:57.840]  hepatitis polio it was in the news again just yesterday we covered it killing
[18:57.840 --> 19:02.880]  kids and in secret illegal vaccine trials I mean knowing that Gardasil
[19:02.880 --> 19:06.400]  kills people it doesn't even protect them from human papillomavirus and
[19:06.400 --> 19:12.880]  knowing it consciously just just to see them knowing that Ritalin causes
[19:12.880 --> 19:22.080]  deformities shrinkage in the brain all sorts of health problems heart expansion
[19:22.440 --> 19:28.040]  to know that what Prozac is so deadly to know it's a toxic psychotropic and
[19:28.040 --> 19:32.160]  they're pushing it on kids to just know that they're doing this it's not a
[19:32.160 --> 19:37.560]  question of if but but but when we stand up to these people now again I wasn't
[19:37.560 --> 19:40.760]  gonna talk about this but now I was gonna talk about the rib cage thing
[19:40.760 --> 19:44.640]  because it's too obvious but I'm gonna stay on air today and I'm gonna stay on
[19:44.640 --> 19:48.600]  air tomorrow because this is pain is not that bad and if my grandmother could
[19:48.600 --> 19:52.920]  walk around with something 10 times 20 times more painful than I can certainly
[19:52.920 --> 19:57.600]  do a radio show with this so I'm not gonna wimp out I'm gonna be here okay

[24:20.520 --> 24:24.120]  about the incredible escalations towards open war with Iran and what that'll
[24:24.120 --> 24:30.040]  lead to the unprecedented power grabs even mainline analysts on quote mainline
[24:30.040 --> 24:34.920]  television are saying it's an unprecedented power grab court fight over
[24:34.920 --> 24:40.320]  recess appointments almost certain Obama to violate a federal law and the
[24:40.320 --> 24:45.920]  Constitution to do this huge power grab and he violates the congressional laws
[24:45.920 --> 24:51.760]  the Democrats by the way ram through more than a decade ago on top of it we've
[24:51.760 --> 24:59.760]  got incredible economic news on the job front and coming up the next segment I
[24:59.760 --> 25:05.560]  want to illustrate that we can fight back against the National Defense
[25:05.560 --> 25:12.520]  Authorization Act there's a reason Obama first said he would not sign it that
[25:12.520 --> 25:16.240]  he would veto it that way people thought oh well it's not going to pass we
[25:16.240 --> 25:20.440]  don't have to fight it then he could also then quietly sign it try to confuse
[25:20.440 --> 25:24.000]  people and then not have a political fight over it they don't want to have a
[25:24.000 --> 25:30.600]  debate about oh you can secretly arrest us you're doing what Hitler did I mean
[25:30.600 --> 25:33.560]  this really illustrates everything we've warned that they've gotten rid of
[25:33.560 --> 25:37.920]  posicom and taught us that they're gonna have military on the streets so we come
[25:37.920 --> 25:42.560]  back I'm gonna air this special report and before I get to that report we come
[25:42.560 --> 25:47.240]  out of the next segment I'm gonna break down this big report that's also up at
[25:47.240 --> 25:51.480]  the drudge report but it's also obviously at info wars comms it's our
[25:51.480 --> 25:57.400]  story DHS officers armed with semi-automatics set up unannounced ID
[25:57.400 --> 26:06.400]  checkpoint in Florida papers please with sub machine guns and there it's
[26:06.400 --> 26:11.480]  happening everywhere with local police under their command I mean this is off
[26:11.480 --> 26:16.040]  the charts unconstitutional remember two years ago in Florida the governor
[26:16.040 --> 26:21.600]  said stop doing this families would pull up to the army state police dragging
[26:21.600 --> 26:24.920]  them out of cars whole highway shut down and homeland security said John Warren
[26:24.920 --> 26:30.480]  defense authorization act we can take you out of office governor we'll do what
[26:30.480 --> 26:34.120]  we want I mean this is total federal takeover and people say well the feds
[26:34.120 --> 26:38.320]  can do that oh really the feds are run by foreign banks
[26:38.800 --> 26:44.360]  you understand we've been taken over we are an occupied nation but here it is
[26:44.360 --> 26:50.040]  DHS officers armed with semi-automatic set up unannounced ID checkpoint in
[26:50.040 --> 26:54.200]  Leesburg Florida here's another one big brother malls trigger privacy fight
[26:54.200 --> 26:58.040]  after installing equivalent to smile shoppers via their mobiles this is
[26:58.040 --> 27:02.280]  already in place you know it's come out in mainstream news a decade ago that most
[27:02.280 --> 27:08.040]  malls have almost subliminal level audio under the mall music saying bye bye
[27:08.040 --> 27:13.080]  happiness you'll be happy when you buy I mean it just we're under mind control
[27:13.080 --> 27:18.840]  just be become aware of it and then it's still hard to fight but if you are
[27:18.840 --> 27:24.000]  naive and just say no nothing's happening everything's fine why do you
[27:24.000 --> 27:28.880]  think they want tyranny right now because this is a global financial
[27:28.880 --> 27:37.080]  implosion by design this is being done by design now of course the biggest news
[27:37.080 --> 27:42.040]  of the day I'm going to get into right now and more when with Dr. Paul Craig
[27:42.040 --> 27:47.200]  Roberts so when he joins us coming up oil prices moved steadily upward as EU
[27:47.200 --> 27:52.480]  prepares Iran embargo and Iran says they will take that as an act of war half
[27:52.480 --> 27:56.760]  their gasoline 51% is imported they got plenty of oil but not the refineries
[27:56.760 --> 28:01.480]  that are always getting blown up by al-qaeda terrorist who work for guess
[28:01.480 --> 28:07.400]  who on record the criminals that run our country you're like al-qaeda works for
[28:07.400 --> 28:12.480]  people who run our government on record that's one thing really freaking out the
[28:12.480 --> 28:16.320]  neocons when their callers calling go why is our government putting al-qaeda in
[28:16.320 --> 28:22.520]  charge of Libya they go that's because Obama's a secret Muslim oh yes yes he's
[28:22.520 --> 28:29.520]  a secret Muslim and I'm an Easter Bunny he's a CIA globalist they use the
[28:29.520 --> 28:33.360]  Muslim extremist to overthrow countries by the way it's in the news that
[28:33.360 --> 28:39.160]  Haji Mubarak is facing the death penalty and globalist back to judges that
[28:39.160 --> 28:43.440]  there's a worth tyranny in charge there now and Mubarak wouldn't follow every
[28:43.440 --> 28:47.480]  order to get behind World War three and attack Iran he wouldn't get behind that
[28:47.480 --> 28:51.080]  so guess what they're now gonna have a kangaroo trial and execute their old

[35:04.720 --> 35:10.480]  public just like they would say 15 years ago the NSA didn't exist they would say
[35:10.480 --> 35:14.160]  that on the news and that they would have national media attack myself and
[35:14.160 --> 35:18.000]  others if you talked about echelon and spying on citizens and when they were
[35:18.000 --> 35:21.520]  ready they said yeah it's been around for 30 years we spy on everything you
[35:21.520 --> 35:30.040]  do mm-hmm member smart meters five years ago in California people were saying

[36:10.960 --> 36:16.200]  around you cannot legalize tyranny they may say this is a law but it's a fraud
[36:16.200 --> 36:21.960]  here it is under the provisions would it be possible that an American citizen
[36:21.960 --> 36:26.120]  then could be declared an enemy combatant and sent to Guantanamo Bay and
[36:26.120 --> 36:31.960]  detained indefinitely they said it couldn't happen here the administration
[36:31.960 --> 36:37.440]  asked us to remove the language which says that US citizens and lawful
[36:37.440 --> 36:42.040]  residents would not be subject to this section there would never be trips on
[36:42.040 --> 36:48.080]  the streets of America there would always be due process and when they say I
[36:48.080 --> 36:53.320]  want my lawyer you tell them shut up your time to get a lawyer you're the
[36:53.320 --> 36:57.600]  enemy combat it was the conspiracy theorist that warned that there was a
[36:57.600 --> 37:02.280]  plan to overthrow our republic and use the military against the people but
[37:02.280 --> 37:06.560]  FEMA camps have been built that citizens can be secretly arrested and
[37:06.560 --> 37:13.040]  disappeared I want that person to be terrified about what's gonna happen to
[37:13.040 --> 37:20.760]  them in American custody and now in DAA 2012 is law it did happen here please
[37:20.760 --> 37:26.640]  know what will come your way death detention prosecution it's a legitimate
[37:26.640 --> 37:33.160]  it's a fraud it's tyranny in your face the only question is will the people of
[37:33.160 --> 37:38.800]  the United States let this tyranny now be put into action it's one thing to
[37:38.800 --> 37:44.240]  pass an unconstitutional law it's another thing to actually implement the
[37:44.240 --> 37:49.680]  globalist have bitten off more than they can chew the republic is rising and
[37:49.680 --> 37:57.480]  the spirit of 1776 flies proudly on our banners it's time for everybody out
[37:57.480 --> 38:03.120]  there watching to have a gut check and to decide what side are you on do you
[38:03.120 --> 38:07.000]  stand with our constitutional republic or do you stand with the corrupt
[38:07.000 --> 38:10.800]  politicians that have been bought and sold a hundred times by offshore mega
[38:10.800 --> 38:15.920]  banks that are conquering this country through fraud the reason the National
[38:15.920 --> 38:19.760]  Defense Authorization Act was ran through Congress and the reason President
[38:19.760 --> 38:24.640]  Obama treacherously and traitorously signed it is because the power structure
[38:24.640 --> 38:29.480]  the ruling class is scared of the people they know that we're waking up to the
[38:29.480 --> 38:32.600]  private Federal Reserve Banking Cartel they know that we're waking up to
[38:32.600 --> 38:38.040]  secret arrest and torture they know that we know that offshore banks have
[38:38.040 --> 38:42.040]  taken over this country through fraud and signed us on to over a thousand
[38:42.040 --> 38:48.680]  trillion dollars of fraudulent garbage derivatives paper they know the Ponzi
[38:48.680 --> 38:55.240]  scheme is coming down and so they ram through the NDA and Obama said that he
[38:55.240 --> 39:00.080]  was gonna veto it so that he wouldn't take the political pressure then he
[39:00.080 --> 39:05.080]  signed it in the final hours of 2011 when he thought everybody wasn't paying
[39:05.080 --> 39:11.040]  attention and was partying on New Year's Eve and he did that because crimes
[39:11.040 --> 39:16.520]  are committed in the dark they don't want their open tyranny to be a wakeup
[39:16.520 --> 39:21.120]  call to people they want to silently have our Republic go into that long
[39:21.120 --> 39:26.080]  night they want to stab this country in the back when nobody's watching there's
[39:26.080 --> 39:30.120]  a problem I'm watching Ron Paul's watching you're watching and we're
[39:30.120 --> 39:38.680]  involved and like Paul Revere before us we are warning people worldwide just
[39:38.680 --> 39:43.440]  look at the NDA and its passage all the lies oh it first it didn't affect
[39:43.440 --> 39:47.400]  citizens now they admit it does a global declaration of war against all
[39:47.400 --> 39:52.240]  countries Congress handing that power to the president making him a dictator
[39:52.240 --> 39:58.440]  secret arrest of citizens torture indefinite detention then the senators
[39:58.440 --> 40:01.840]  came out who authored and said you better affect citizens we want you to be
[40:01.840 --> 40:07.240]  scared and they went further and said don't criticize us Obama demanded this
[40:07.240 --> 40:10.720]  be the legislation the ACLU and others went to Obama and said did you really do
[40:10.720 --> 40:15.960]  this and they said yes that's how bad this deception has gotten where they
[40:15.960 --> 40:21.680]  want to have their tyrannical cake and eat it too but why are they hiding the
[40:21.680 --> 40:26.360]  fact that it affects citizens why are they hiding the fact that Obama signed
[40:26.360 --> 40:31.160]  it because they want to do their crimes secretly because they know what they're
[40:31.160 --> 40:37.400]  doing is wrong and they want to now implement this draconian classical
[40:37.400 --> 40:43.040]  tyranny behind the scenes ahead of the next staged event the next false flag
[40:43.040 --> 40:49.720]  the next big war they want to roll this out with test cases with unsavory types
[40:49.720 --> 40:54.600]  of people like Amaral Alakia US citizen they claim that they killed extra
[40:54.600 --> 41:00.080]  judicially so they can sell the public on the idea of people disappearing into
[41:00.080 --> 41:06.280]  black holes that's why it's so important now more than ever to get the truth
[41:06.280 --> 41:12.760]  about this defense authorization act to everyone you know in my 17 years on air
[41:12.760 --> 41:19.480]  I have never seen an issue shake people out of their sleep out of their social
[41:19.480 --> 41:25.320]  trance like this has done the apologies via email and comments on our websites
[41:25.320 --> 41:30.600]  are coming in by the thousands radio talk show hosts are apologizing congressional
[41:30.600 --> 41:35.080]  aides are calling me and apologizing because everything that we warned the
[41:35.080 --> 41:42.560]  public about is now unfolding not just the establishment of military operations
[41:42.560 --> 41:48.360]  domestically not just secret arrest and torture not just new wars but the
[41:48.360 --> 41:53.040]  warrantless wiretapping the the TSA checkpoints on the highways it's all
[41:53.040 --> 41:58.440]  happening and the system wouldn't have rammed this legislation through and
[41:58.440 --> 42:05.640]  exposed their despotic game plan if they weren't accelerating their timetable
[42:05.640 --> 42:12.520]  war with Iran economic collapse by design it's all coming but at this
[42:12.520 --> 42:16.600]  critical juncture when the globalists are uncloking themselves they are
[42:16.600 --> 42:22.240]  extremely weak because now they are naked in front of us they are brazenly
[42:22.240 --> 42:29.080]  there proving to everyone that they are criminals it is treason to overthrow the
[42:29.080 --> 42:32.880]  Constitution and Bill of Rights they passed legislation before saying black
[42:32.880 --> 42:39.000]  people weren't humans they could pass legislation saying that white people are
[42:39.000 --> 42:44.720]  slaves or something it doesn't make it show all laws that are repugnant and
[42:44.720 --> 42:50.960]  unconstitutional are null and void Marbury versus Madison and thousands of
[42:50.960 --> 42:58.200]  other rulings tyrants take over by degree and the system is simply testing
[42:58.200 --> 43:04.000]  the public now to see if they can get away with this legislation first and then
[43:04.000 --> 43:09.240]  to see piecemeal if they can get away with it incrementally they're not gonna
[43:09.240 --> 43:13.120]  come snatch you out of your house overnight they're not gonna activate the
[43:13.120 --> 43:18.320]  now public FEMA camps overnight they're going to sell it as something that
[43:18.320 --> 43:23.640]  they're rolling out to save and safeguard society they're going to script
[43:23.640 --> 43:29.320]  every facet of it and that's why we've got to be there at every point
[43:29.320 --> 43:34.400]  confronting them pointing out their fraud pointing out the true history and
[43:34.400 --> 43:39.800]  decrying what they're doing just like our ancestors Paul Revere and our founding
[43:39.800 --> 43:44.640]  fathers did so I am upset that they did pass the NDAA it shows what tyrants and
[43:44.640 --> 43:49.240]  just how corrupt and ruthless they are can you imagine what's coming next you
[43:49.240 --> 43:53.760]  notice things just get crazier and crazier now I'm upset about that but
[43:53.760 --> 43:59.560]  there's a silver lining in every cloud this is waking people up and has really
[43:59.560 --> 44:05.720]  thrown the gauntlet down in everyone's face it's time to make a decision it's
[44:05.720 --> 44:12.880]  time to get involved it's time to warn everyone you know it's time to realize
[44:12.880 --> 44:18.560]  we've got a two-party dictatorship engage and insider trading and every
[44:18.560 --> 44:23.200]  other form of corruption you can imagine who think that they're gonna be able to
[44:23.200 --> 44:28.320]  not only continue this corruption but expand it that's the thing about corrupt
[44:28.320 --> 44:33.600]  governments they get more corrupt or you bring them to justice they get more
[44:33.600 --> 44:38.920]  emboldened and then when they've gone so far that the public wakes up they
[44:38.920 --> 44:42.760]  always try to come in and clamp down on the public and they've always got
[44:42.760 --> 44:47.200]  excuses foreign enemies domestic terrorists it's happened over and over
[44:47.200 --> 44:53.520]  again incredible despotism has come to every nation history and now it's coming
[44:53.520 --> 45:00.080]  here we know history and so if we educate others and stand tall we are not
[45:00.080 --> 45:06.760]  doomed to repeat it so let's take this information with the NDAA and all the
[45:06.760 --> 45:12.720]  lies associated with it and use it as a teaching moment and not just a moment
[45:12.720 --> 45:19.080]  of instruction but a moment of awakening it's now time for those of you out there
[45:19.080 --> 45:23.160]  that grovel to the establishment and go along with whatever the system does and
[45:23.160 --> 45:27.760]  make excuses for it to realize you are not part of the power structure you
[45:27.760 --> 45:31.440]  haven't chosen to join the New World Order and so you're on the winning team
[45:31.440 --> 45:36.040]  less than one tenth of one percent from our research is actually part of this
[45:36.040 --> 45:41.080]  new order system and stands to gain from it that's what even Rothkopf head of the
[45:41.080 --> 45:44.320]  Kissinger Group wrote a few years ago in his book super class admitting a
[45:44.320 --> 45:49.000]  global government run by six thousand top technocrats you're not one of the
[45:49.000 --> 45:53.640]  technocrats that the Economist magazine pushes and promotes as our saviors who
[45:53.640 --> 45:57.920]  are actually the authors and engineers of all of our problems you are going to
[45:57.920 --> 46:01.360]  have your standard of living lowered you're going to have your freedoms
[46:01.360 --> 46:05.080]  lowered and just because you've served the system doesn't mean that you won't
[46:05.080 --> 46:09.240]  be devoured by it the good news is for every action there's an equal and
[46:09.240 --> 46:14.760]  opposite reaction there is a giant awakening happening and now is the time
[46:14.760 --> 46:20.840]  people's minds are fertile to hear the truth they have never been more open to
[46:20.840 --> 46:24.400]  be given the true information about history and about the New World Order
[46:24.400 --> 46:28.560]  about what's happening so I'm begging all of you to be the leaders you are and
[46:28.560 --> 46:33.920]  to reach out to everyone you can with banner hangs local newsletters talk
[46:33.920 --> 46:38.000]  radio shows calling into talk radio going and speaking at your city council
[46:38.000 --> 46:43.480]  running for Congress running for mayor running for sheriff because resistance
[46:43.480 --> 46:49.160]  is victory we've got to intensify the buzz that we see around Ron Paul and
[46:49.160 --> 46:55.600]  liberty to every issue and every area and all of us need to be like Ron Paul
[46:55.600 --> 47:01.000]  all of us need to be like other patriots that have come before us it's just like
[47:01.000 --> 47:05.840]  in the movie Spartacus which is based on a true story a slave revolt in southern
[47:05.840 --> 47:09.640]  Italy against the nation state of Rome and they're looking for Spartacus and
[47:09.640 --> 47:13.040]  they're looking for his body they're trying to find him and the slaves that
[47:13.040 --> 47:16.960]  they've captured start standing up and saying I'm Spartacus no I'm Spartacus
[47:16.960 --> 47:24.520]  no I'm Spartacus it's Victor Hugo that said no army can stop an idea whose time
[47:24.520 --> 47:30.880]  has come they can't stop us all and one cautionary note to enforcers of this
[47:30.880 --> 47:37.160]  system military police and others that are being asked to engage in classical
[47:37.160 --> 47:41.280]  oppression of the American people you're gonna be given plausible cover
[47:41.280 --> 47:46.160]  stories for doing what you're gonna be asked to do in the future but remember
[47:46.160 --> 47:51.440]  all of this was set up in the past 16 years or so all of this was being
[47:51.440 --> 47:56.880]  covertly planned the derivatives the banking takeover all of this has been
[47:56.880 --> 48:01.880]  planned out but because we have been aware of it we've got a serious jump on
[48:01.880 --> 48:07.120]  the globalist right now because we were there for decades warning people ahead
[48:07.120 --> 48:10.440]  of time now we have a lot of credibility and I want to warn the power
[48:10.440 --> 48:15.120]  structure that this is not gonna be a cakewalk the London Telegraph the
[48:15.120 --> 48:19.640]  Associated Press they're all reporting that in the month of December more than
[48:19.640 --> 48:26.440]  1.5 million FBI instant background checks were done and on average people were
[48:26.440 --> 48:32.440]  buying two guns or more we're talking about 3 million guns sold in the month
[48:32.440 --> 48:38.080]  of December an all-time record and the purchasing of guns is only accelerating
[48:38.080 --> 48:42.520]  I saw surveys where the public was asked why they're buying guns and the
[48:42.520 --> 48:47.720]  majority said because of economic collapse because of social unrest and
[48:47.720 --> 48:53.200]  we don't trust the government the systems iron fist is not going to work
[48:53.200 --> 48:58.400]  against an armed population that understands the score and so I want to
[48:58.400 --> 49:02.520]  challenge the global controllers to rethink what they're doing and to look
[49:02.520 --> 49:07.560]  at history and to pull back and to realize that you are not in a good
[49:07.560 --> 49:12.040]  position even if you stage some big false flag terror attacks the people are
[49:12.040 --> 49:17.480]  awakened to you and are now aware of what you're doing and the American people
[49:17.480 --> 49:22.120]  if you do launch the Civil War operation in the US are going to ensure
[49:22.120 --> 49:28.000]  that the controllers not the low-level minions are brought to justice we need
[49:28.000 --> 49:32.160]  to be reaching out to police and military now and asking them to make the
[49:32.160 --> 49:37.080]  choice to join the Republic and the spirit of 1776 to peacefully bring back
[49:37.080 --> 49:41.280]  our country and to bring these criminals to justice we do not need to be played
[49:41.280 --> 49:46.080]  off against each other this is part of the globalist plan and needs to be
[49:46.080 --> 49:53.640]  averted tyranny is here it's up to you to face it and to take action against it
[49:53.640 --> 50:00.360]  through peaceful ways let us work now while the Sun still shines so that if we
[50:00.360 --> 50:06.600]  do go into that dark night of true hardcore tyranny we would have done
[50:06.600 --> 50:11.960]  everything we could beforehand to avert what's coming but I know from history
[50:11.960 --> 50:18.400]  many times tyrannies are diffused if the public is warned by patriots and we've
[50:18.400 --> 50:22.920]  got a good chance of doing that right now I'm Alex Jones shining off from the

[55:02.280 --> 55:06.640]  special report we just aired I'd like to get your take on the fact that they've
[55:06.640 --> 55:11.040]  gone from saying they might attack Iran to selling the idea that it's a foregone
[55:11.040 --> 55:18.160]  conclusion as that military buildup in Kuwait Israel Afghanistan Saudi Arabia
[55:18.160 --> 55:22.920]  and other nations accelerates I've talked to military sources and they say
[55:22.920 --> 55:27.600]  it's on they were thinking about doing it late last year but now it's going to
[55:27.600 --> 55:37.920]  happen sometime before the election so we are certainly trying to avert that
[55:37.920 --> 55:43.080]  happening we didn't we do need to discuss exactly what it's going to mean
[55:43.080 --> 55:53.640]  and what is going to unfold if this crisis goes live and they're certainly
[55:53.640 --> 56:00.800]  moving towards that the toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231
[56:00.800 --> 56:11.280]  800-259-9231 and we will get you up and on the air today we can also talk about
[56:11.280 --> 56:15.840]  Obama's unprecedented power grab with these recess appointments I'm going to
[56:15.840 --> 56:21.000]  get into a bunch of high-tech technology news including a top radiation
[56:21.000 --> 56:25.200]  doctor says TSA naked body scanners can cause cancer but a whole bunch of them
[56:25.200 --> 56:30.240]  come out and this is out of the Florida Sun Sentinel natural news is reporting
[56:30.240 --> 56:35.440]  on that but the TSA is told it's good for them they tell the troops to use good
[56:35.440 --> 56:39.800]  for them now oh don't worry about it this is the level of deception we're
[56:39.800 --> 56:45.000]  dealing with now the video slash audio report that we just premiered here
[56:45.000 --> 56:50.840]  that's powerful audio wise but really powerful when you can see it is key to
[56:50.840 --> 56:55.280]  alert Americans to what we face and how our own military is being trained and
[56:55.280 --> 57:00.080]  turned against us along with giant federal security forces who've been
[57:00.080 --> 57:04.720]  taught total disdain for the middle rights and Constitution I've run into the
[57:04.720 --> 57:07.480]  Viper teams in New York back when they were beta testing them and they bugged
[57:07.480 --> 57:11.960]  their eyes out old ladies they they search bags they scream at people they
[57:11.960 --> 57:16.480]  stand around like they're like they're out of a comic book of bad guys because
[57:16.480 --> 57:19.720]  you'll do you and sit there with their guns looking back and forth like
[57:19.720 --> 57:23.360]  terrorists or everywhere I mean you've got to be mentally ill to think that you
[57:23.360 --> 57:28.880]  know the threat is so imminent and they they find little kids men that are
[57:28.880 --> 57:32.920]  basically little kids who want to play army against us the people and this is
[57:32.920 --> 57:36.200]  this happens in every other country it's happening here we've got to turn this
[57:36.200 --> 57:41.560]  around and the title of the article and the video going up in minutes at info
[57:41.560 --> 57:48.440]  wars.com is NDAA is a hoax you cannot legalize
[57:48.440 --> 57:54.280]  tyranny and I'll go and I break it down in the video you can say black people
[57:54.280 --> 57:59.000]  or slaves again I don't care if you have a law they're not just like you can have
[57:59.000 --> 58:03.520]  a law saying people can abort babies it's always been illegal until now and it
[58:03.520 --> 58:08.520]  should be illegal they go well what if it's life-threatening they've always
[58:08.520 --> 58:13.040]  gone into surgery if the woman's gonna die that's not called an abortion it's
[58:13.040 --> 58:19.520]  called an emergency procedure totally different very very simple it's
[58:19.520 --> 58:23.960]  incredible how they play mind games with people so a crime is a crime the
[58:23.960 --> 58:27.640]  government could pass a law saying they can you know use kids for skeet
[58:27.640 --> 58:33.320]  practice or they can take your house and make you their slave it isn't a
[58:33.320 --> 58:37.480]  law it's a fraud it's a hoax we need to explain this to people and form a
[58:37.480 --> 58:40.440]  movement against it

[58:53.840 --> 58:57.560]  non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you
[58:57.560 --> 59:01.120]  know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than
[59:01.120 --> 59:04.880]  silver or gold it's true seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in
[59:04.880 --> 59:08.760]  this country and it's possible that could even happen again so our friends at
[59:08.760 --> 59:13.200]  solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they
[59:13.200 --> 59:18.240]  call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient
[59:18.240 --> 59:21.960]  dense food for you and your family and here's the best part these seeds have
[59:21.960 --> 59:25.800]  not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to
[59:25.800 --> 59:30.240]  plant a full acre crisis garden so visit them today at survival seed bank

[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:42.920]  to some of your calls Jim in Texas welcome sir hey Alex it's great to be
[01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:48.440]  on with you again great to have you hey I wanted to comment on the Iran
[01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:53.960]  situation and two other things real quick if I can get them in sure first off my
[01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:57.280]  opinions don't reflect that of the Department of Defense I have worked in
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:02.160]  military intelligence active duty I'm a combat veteran I'm currently in a
[01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:08.040]  National Guard right now but I've used on Iran or open source and the they can
[01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:11.160]  be heard in all the intelligence communities this is an attack we've
[01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:15.200]  been getting ready for for quite some time this is an attack that nobody in the
[01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:21.280]  military that I know wants to fight and it's it's everything you say it is true
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:27.040]  Alex I can't really refute anything and what is from open source what are you
[01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:32.000]  expecting the attack to be a joint strike or after Iran retaliates then the
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:38.920]  US gets involved well of course we can look at our history as a nation from the
[01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:44.880]  USS Maine to other instances and we can pretty easily deduct that we're
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:50.760]  probably going to probably experience some sort of quote unquote attack in a
[01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:54.560]  straight of our moves and then retaliation with the Iranians we know
[01:02:54.560 --> 01:03:00.200]  Cheney it came out New York magazine did admittedly want to paint up US
[01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:05.120]  patrol boats have Navy SEALs do a mock attack on a on a ship that didn't know
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:11.160]  it was mock attack I let the SEALs you know perhaps even get killed to blame
[01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:15.200]  on Iran but why would Iran shoot their mouth off and say don't come back
[01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:19.160]  through here with your carriers this is your last warning why would their head
[01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:24.640]  of intelligence here it is out of the Israeli daily Israeli national news it
[01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:32.880]  was also in Iranian news Iran threatens street war in Tel Aviv and US I mean
[01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:38.880]  that's just doing exactly what the globalists want and we've got heroes
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:46.840]  like Fox Fallon who saved us back in 2007 and Iran is their intelligence is
[01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:52.440]  spot-on they know what's going on they know our history and it's a scary
[01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:56.760]  proposition that a lot of soldiers are afraid of that's why you see so much
[01:03:56.760 --> 01:04:02.800]  support for Ron Paul and real quick Alex there's a former Army Ranger captain
[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:07.960]  named Antonio Bueller who lives in the Austin area and he's a strong advocate
[01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:12.080]  for Ron Paul combat veteran he was assaulted by the police on New Year's
[01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:16.600]  Eve you can just go on YouTube and find that the local office station has
[01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:23.160]  already done a story it's on video and we need to support him and what happened
[01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:28.240]  to Antonio Bueller is his name yeah he's a former he's a West Point graduate
[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:34.640]  former Army captain Tony and Bueller what they do what they do to him well he
[01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:37.960]  was standing up for a girl who was not being ripped out of her car by Austin

[01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:13.680]  war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:26.720]  all right we are now eight minutes into the second hour dr. Paul Craig roberts
[01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:32.040]  joining us at the bottom of the hour to break down well this news the Israeli
[01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:37.600]  newspapers including Jerusalem Post are reporting thousands of US troops are
[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:43.320]  being deployed not going there for an exercise but deployed and there are other
[01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:51.280]  reports here out of the New York Times Debka file and others saw these Gulf
[01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:58.880]  States on war alert for early US Iran clash here is the New York Times oil
[01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:07.200]  prices would skyrocket if Iran closed the straight of or moose it continues the
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:11.760]  deployment of thousands of US troops to Israel the interrogation of US Israeli
[01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:15.040]  command structures they're now integrating the US Israeli command
[01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:18.960]  structures we're gonna be breaking all of that down but they're going back to
[01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:24.400]  Jim in Texas who was saying he was an army intelligence now he's in the
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:28.640]  National Guard and he was saying this is all open source what he was saying but
[01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:32.440]  but that yes they're getting ready to attack Iran I want you to elaborate on
[01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:35.520]  that because that's what all my military sources are saying and now it's pretty
[01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:39.560]  much mainstream you know fact they're just making it a foregone conclusion and
[01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:43.120]  getting ready for the domestic checkpoints and actually setting some
[01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:51.040]  up and passing the martial law enabling act in DA and power grabbing with
[01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:54.880]  recess appointments then the government pretty much does whatever it wants
[01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:57.480]  because they think once they kick off something that could lead to World War
[01:09:57.480 --> 01:10:07.000]  III everything is going to be just fine now let's go ahead and go back to Jim in
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:10.760]  Texas Jim finish your point on that and tell us the story of what happened in
[01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:18.680]  Austin well Alex you do a great job of spreading the truth you know Operation
[01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:24.360]  Ajax operation Northwoods USS Liberty operation Gladio they are all open
[01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:28.600]  source case studies that you know guys like myself and guys that I've served
[01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:34.640]  with in the intelligence unit we look at that and it becomes more than obvious
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:39.400]  it's all of us what goes on behind the scenes now a lot of us don't take part in
[01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:44.680]  stuff like that we're there serving God and country and but these examples are
[01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:49.640]  are more than out in the open you mentioned Cheney in 2007 Fox balance
[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:54.080]  stood up to him he basically got acts for that just like a limitzer did under
[01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:59.160]  JFK for Northwoods and you know then you got guys like Lieutenant Colonel Anthony
[01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:03.640]  Schaefer that it works in the same branch of military intelligence I do and
[01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:09.880]  he does a great job of you know sharing the open source with everybody else but
[01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:13.440]  then you know even some of the open source gets redacted when he writes that
[01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:19.000]  book so it's really a battle that that you are helping you know guys like me
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.720]  and guys like Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer when you're in the in the
[01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:29.960]  public eye well that's right Colonel Schaefer has come out and he has
[01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:35.480]  basically and you know endorse Ron Paul's analysis of what's happening with
[01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:40.880]  Iran and then there's a reason that Benjamin Netanyahu had to fire the head
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:45.320]  of Mossad last year when he told him it would be quote a catastrophe to attack
[01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:50.920]  Iran he said it again two weeks ago in the Jerusalem Post and Harats most
[01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:55.640]  Israelis the polls are between 50 60 70% but they you know that they vary but
[01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:59.840]  it's around half or more depending on which poll you look at they don't want
[01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:03.640]  this war and and it's not like the former head of the Mossads a fan of Iran
[01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:09.560]  they know that it's going to unify the entire Arab world they're going to end
[01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:17.800]  up basically launching a giant attack through surrogates against Israel but
[01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:21.600]  see that's what some of the leadership in Israel and the US and Europe want
[01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:25.800]  because it'll be a diversion the big crisis will be a diversion from the
[01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:29.800]  banker bailouts the banking takeovers the carbon taxes the police state the
[01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:34.400]  fast and furious and it will allow them to take even more liberties because they
[01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:38.600]  know people tend to rally around the flag once a big war starts I mean you
[01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:42.040]  know our ships are getting blown up and there's just an all-out huge war it
[01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:45.560]  won't be like the military just going in and killing a bunch of you know starving
[01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:50.280]  Iraqis and then a few troops get killed when the US is really an absurdious war
[01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:54.480]  with a lot of casualties people tend to just say well I don't like the war but
[01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:58.760]  we got to get behind them and we and it's going to be horrible they have
[01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:04.560]  maneuvered us into this position and again it's not our government foreign
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:08.920]  interest run our government globalist run our government globalist run Israel
[01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:15.680]  and they want this new giant war with Iran and I go back to Iran and the
[01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:19.440]  current mullahs being flown in by the CIA and 79 people are like are you
[01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:23.240]  kidding yeah just like Al Qaeda was given Libya I mean 20 years from now we'll
[01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:26.880]  be saying you know remember where Libya was given to Al Qaeda by NATO people
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:32.000]  like oh yeah right it's a fact folks know that now it's just been in the news 20
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:37.760]  years from now people may not remember but it's 79 now 30 plus years ago they
[01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:40.400]  brought him in and they claim there was double crossing going on but they use
[01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:46.480]  the same radicals to overthrow moza deck in 53 so this could all just be
[01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:52.900]  saber-rattling I mean at a certain point I don't think Iran works with the
[01:13:52.900 --> 01:13:56.560]  globalist but I know without Iran Contra they got missiles and things you
[01:13:56.560 --> 01:14:01.320]  know in deals secretly and our government use drug money cocaine money in the
[01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:05.560]  US to be able to buy those weapons off record that's all on record so what do
[01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:11.560]  you think what do your colleagues think about what's going on well they're
[01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:17.120]  scared to death that you know we might be called to go to war with Iran because
[01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:23.560]  Iran like you mentioned it's not Iraq it's not Afghanistan it's a much
[01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:29.680]  different threat they know what's going on and you know some of the coal that
[01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:34.960]  we've taken I tried to get on the other day when you had Dr. Doug Rocky on one
[01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:39.400]  of my friends who I can't name his name he doesn't want his story going out with
[01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:44.680]  he's a he hasn't even made for 30 yet and he's riddled with cancer he's gonna die
[01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:51.200]  it started off with thyroid cancer he's gonna die and a lot of us you know we've
[01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:57.800]  been exposed to all sorts of depleted uranium we slept in craters from the
[01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:04.400]  first Gulf War that were just completely just just laced with radiation I've had
[01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:08.840]  stuff removed from my body and what we have to understand as soldiers if there's
[01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:12.840]  any soldiers out there listening right now that still support some of these
[01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:20.000]  these these monsters like Gingrich or Santorum draft Dodger Newt we have to
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:24.200]  understand that we are being led to slaughter they don't care about us
[01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:28.280]  anymore guys like Dr. Doug Rocky they they give their life how many operations
[01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:34.160]  did the guy have to you know 30 some and members of the team are dead this is all
[01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:39.560]  gonna happen to us and if we don't stand up and become a vocal minority this
[01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:46.560]  country is gonna is gonna go away well I'll tell you this DU issue Jim
[01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:54.320]  explains it all when in the 40s 50 60 70s 80s and 90s I've researched the entire
[01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:57.240]  history of it interviewed all the experts not just Doug Rocky who's the
[01:15:57.240 --> 01:16:01.280]  top expert literally wrote the book for the Pentagon in the mid 90s on it and
[01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:05.960]  the previous reports in the 80s physicists you name it you know what a
[01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:11.840]  couple PhDs they would never let him use it they had it as a byproduct of
[01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:17.720]  making atomic and hydrogen bombs they were gonna have to store it and it
[01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:21.920]  wasn't up until the 90s or so that they went ahead kind of like it took three
[01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:26.600]  tries for Rumsfeld to get aspartame approved in the 60s 70s they failed he
[01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:33.200]  got it approved and went 1980 very toxic but nothing compared to DU but the
[01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:36.840]  point is is that in by the early 90s they just went ahead sort of using it as
[01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:42.880]  for forklift ballast aircraft ballast weapons system you know tips armor
[01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:47.960]  piercing all of this but previous to that they said you can never use this
[01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:53.520]  because it ignites in the barrel and it gives people slow kill dosages to use
[01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:57.480]  any of it now it's used at proving grounds everywhere now it's used all over
[01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:02.520]  the place and it shows all these people that claim all day how they love the
[01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:08.560]  troops and don't say the war is wrong or I'll punch you in the nose you know
[01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:17.480]  don't say that that killing somebody you know for oil or whatever is wrong or
[01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:21.400]  I'll punch you in the nose you know our troops were all patriotic they want war
[01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:25.840]  no they don't that's why CNN cut the feed when that guy in uniform was up
[01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:28.680]  there talking about that way is like well you're a hero you've been in for
[01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:32.200]  ten years two tours highly decorated they said yeah and I don't want this war
[01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:35.200]  boom they cut the feed now we found other incidents where they do the same
[01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:39.120]  thing that's because they want this image that you support the troops by
[01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:42.800]  treating them like garbage and they could find people that kind of buy into
[01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:47.480]  all this will go along with it but it is a scourge on the military and we've we
[01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:51.400]  have a responsibility to make sure DU is not used God bless you and I
[01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:55.520]  appreciate your call Steven Illinois you're on the air go ahead thanks for
[01:17:55.520 --> 01:18:01.600]  holding okay Alex two quick history lessons one might want to delve into
[01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:07.120]  pre-World War two Germany and see how the squeeze play was being put on Hitler
[01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:12.280]  and the Nazis I don't want to come to such a high rise so solidly because the
[01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:15.560]  people had had enough it's almost a blueprint of what's going on in this
[01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:23.440]  country today number two you know the United Nations was started 45 they had
[01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:28.280]  this figured out we didn't know it that in 65 years see Roosevelt got us so we
[01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:36.400]  retired at 65 and you had 65 years to 1945 what do you got 2010 that's when
[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:40.320]  they started grabbing all these pensions and everything and sorry it was our
[01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:48.220]  Pentagon that set up the UN and they would use McCarthy to take people's
[01:18:48.220 --> 01:18:52.440]  rights but when he figured out that our elite our own government and our own
[01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:55.600]  Pentagon was funding the communists that's when they destroyed him but now
[01:18:55.600 --> 01:19:00.520]  it's all been declassified it was all true yes the mega robber barons wanted
[01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:04.840]  to destroy freedom and they used America as the command base to do it while
[01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:09.600]  funding the communist so that they could be the other side of it to create the
[01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:14.600]  illusion of choice you bet and the other historical facts a little bit before
[01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:19.320]  your time Ronald Reagan came in and it was a race to the bomb that's what got
[01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:24.520]  me arrested 32 years ago what was going on deregulation and they were going to
[01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:29.880]  ship industry offshore at taxpayers expense on top of it and what that
[01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:35.480]  ends up being like today is a hush money situation because they're gonna build
[01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:38.480]  up all these other countries that's over there so we can go in with our
[01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:44.960]  military adventurism and feel their raw goods and everything and at the same
[01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:48.320]  time give them playing money that's what we're doing China is nothing more than
[01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:52.400]  hush money so we could do what we're doing and they let us run around without
[01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:57.800]  attacking our no that's exactly what globalism is a giant payoff and the

[01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:25.840]  Reagan when I studied Ronald Reagan in depth he wasn't a bad person
[01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:30.080]  individually but he was in over his depth I mean they would roll him up to the
[01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:35.040]  podium with his cue cards and that was it George Herbert Walker Bush was running
[01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:38.160]  things from behind the scenes and Reagan when he was actually running
[01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:41.720]  criticized George Herbert Walker Bush and said he's a trilateralist he's a new
[01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:45.640]  world order person we have those clips by the way in the film invisible Empire
[01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:48.960]  that I produced the Jason Burms directive that is available at info
[01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:56.440]  wars.com if you'd like to to get that film and also support us but you know
[01:24:56.440 --> 01:25:00.440]  always get lectured by so-called conservatives they're like oh naftan
[01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:06.520]  gatter great oh open borders are great oh this makes us more competitive really
[01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:13.920]  to give general motors 25 plus billion dollars in the first bailout they got
[01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:19.720]  and they used almost all of it to move plants to Brazil China and Eastern
[01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:31.200]  Europe I mean that all happened how is giving 16 trillion other 10 trillion on
[01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:35.280]  top of that to the Federal Reserve and then they get caught lying and saying
[01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:38.400]  we didn't give any of it to private individuals or foreign banks turns out
[01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:44.760]  most of it 60 plus percent went to it including MSNBC your tax money from the
[01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:47.920]  government to the private Federal Reserve to have Rachel Maddow sit up
[01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:52.840]  there and talk about banning our Second Amendment I mean it's treason it's a
[01:25:52.840 --> 01:26:00.640]  bunch of foreign corporations that wrap their tyranny in a flag and here's an
[01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:07.160]  example USA Today if this stuff is just in the open now GM deal moves electric
[01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:13.960]  car development to China a shakedown I mean even USA Today sounds like my show
[01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:23.880]  because that's what it is and there goes your tax money that you paid for no one
[01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:26.600]  will buy these electric cars they sold like 10,000 or something last time I
[01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:33.800]  checked they said they were gonna sell millions of them and it's all going
[01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:43.000]  overseas I mean as if we can't compete with Chinese slave labor and and them
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:48.640]  chaining their kids while they're going into work to power polls because they
[01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:53.840]  won't pay them enough to even live in many areas this is on record guys type in
[01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:59.040]  Chinese workers chaining children to lamp post it'll pull up news articles on it
[01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:03.240]  people won't believe that it's like selling political dissidents organs this
[01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:06.640]  is the race to the bottom you don't build up China and build up the rest of the
[01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:11.400]  world by having the lowest standards ever known you suck everything down with
[01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:14.840]  it as Ross Perot explained I mean explain how it works
[01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:18.960]  Canadian workers were paid on average about $10 an hour more than we were
[01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:23.480]  soon as they got rid of any type of tariffs or controls their jobs moved
[01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:30.360]  to United States now we open this up to Mexico two things are gonna happen the
[01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:33.480]  workers are come up here and drive down the wages but even more they're gonna
[01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:36.520]  go to Mexico and drive them down you're gonna have a giant sucking sound but
[01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:42.040]  that's only for a while then what's gonna happen is you're gonna have the
[01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:47.920]  jobs go to India and to China Mexico is gonna be destroyed by this all the
[01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:51.520]  people down there the farmers that are sustainable have a good way alive this
[01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:56.520]  is going to destroy Mexico there's 15 million people right now in Mexico City
[01:27:56.520 --> 01:28:00.920]  I predict within a decade it'll be 30 million being forced up there to work
[01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:05.320]  in factories and then come into the United States being given welfare this
[01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:09.840]  will destroy the entire global system but in the short term it'll allow major
[01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:15.800]  corporations to have larger profits it is not free or fair trade to allow
[01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:21.360]  China to have no environmental standards no workers compensation no social
[01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:26.560]  security and to pay tax incentives to move American jobs over there this
[01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:30.840]  country is going to be completely destroyed economically now that's the
[01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:36.200]  facts Al Gore starts laughing at him on Larry King live we have clips of that
[01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:42.280]  and follow the Republic he goes haha very funny this will double our jobs
[01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:50.240]  Larry I mean that Nellie con artist and Ross prose get matter matter because
[01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:53.680]  he's one about Ross Perot he was right on those subjects and cared about this
[01:28:53.680 --> 01:28:57.720]  country when they called him a conspiracy theorist when he came out and
[01:28:57.720 --> 01:29:02.120]  said I've been told my wife and daughters will be killed that's fine this
[01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:05.560]  country's in a lot of trouble I'm dropping out they're like oh that's
[01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:10.120]  ridiculous George Herbert Walker Bush wouldn't threaten him

[01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:21.560]  already left the United States but I'm gonna try to get a hold of him in
[01:33:21.560 --> 01:33:26.400]  Mexico and find out about this because I'm here reading about this even on the
[01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:31.200]  Blaze website that's just one of the many places that's running with it and
[01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:35.440]  even the people commenting there say this guy's selling a book this sounds
[01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:41.320]  really weird it comes off strange the the OP and Anthony show show I've been a
[01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:45.480]  guest on before I'd have him as a guest here but the they cuss so much we're on
[01:33:45.480 --> 01:33:53.200]  FCC stations they're just on XM this younger Navy SEAL Chris Kyle says that
[01:33:53.200 --> 01:34:00.160]  he was at a bar and that Jesse Ventura was there talking about how the war is a
[01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:05.600]  bunch of murders and wrong so he punched him in the nose and ran away so the
[01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:11.680]  police wouldn't arrest him and he's acting like it's kind of jokin' around
[01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:19.240]  very very strange and separately Jesse you know called him two weeks ago and
[01:34:19.240 --> 01:34:24.120]  said hey they're running a national news story on Fox and TMZ that I was the
[01:34:24.120 --> 01:34:29.520]  police pulled me over for Rubberneck and for tailgating in California and by the
[01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:32.640]  way if this goes in the night before he calls from Minnesota he goes you know
[01:34:32.640 --> 01:34:38.240]  I've been in a federal lawsuit I haven't flown in 15 months and later TMZ had to
[01:34:38.240 --> 01:34:42.480]  retract it so they said he's the police pull him over he's tailgating people and
[01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:47.440]  now it looks like a Psyop now he's in a bar by the way Ventura hasn't drunk
[01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:51.800]  alcohol in decades and it's funny when I was out in Vegas with him you know
[01:34:51.800 --> 01:34:58.720]  shooting the TV show a few months ago we were driving around Jesse and his
[01:34:58.720 --> 01:35:04.720]  wife and I he was talking about baloney in the press and he's like yeah they're
[01:35:04.720 --> 01:35:08.200]  always putting out these stories that I was in a bar in California or a bar in
[01:35:08.200 --> 01:35:12.000]  Nevada and I got knocked out and he goes it's weird he goes Alex do you think
[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:16.160]  Alex do you think that's a Psyop and then of course he called into the show
[01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:19.400]  who's gonna goes Alex I'm very angry I may have to sue them I was not in
[01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:24.480]  California I have proof I'm here I they say I did this and now they got this
[01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:29.840]  this this currently I guess active you're just got out a sniper so I guess
[01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:34.640]  he's been over there shooting Iraqis and it's it's so manly and tough the
[01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:38.800]  disheveled starving people and and and he's all laughing and joking on this
[01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:43.320]  show about punching Ventura in the nose because Ventura is saying the war is
[01:35:43.320 --> 01:35:50.680]  wrong and then running away I mean very bizarre so people are asking me about it
[01:35:50.680 --> 01:35:55.360]  I've got Ventura's wife cell phone but I think he's already gone into Mexico I'm
[01:35:55.360 --> 01:35:58.560]  gonna calling at the end of the show today okay and I'm gonna find out about
[01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:03.840]  this but if I put two and two together I think he told me about this and was
[01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:07.280]  going I was just ought to sue these people but that was before this was ever
[01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:11.760]  out and he will sue people so I if it's not true so I'm gonna find out what's
[01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:16.440]  going on but there's a clear Psyop going on Ron Paul that's on CNN will he
[01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:20.440]  apologize for a Twitter sent from his account and the Twitter's like yeah
[01:36:20.440 --> 01:36:24.400]  Huntsman's an idiot and Paul's like no somebody unauthorized sent that and
[01:36:24.400 --> 01:36:28.480]  since he apologized that lights a big deal oh my gosh they sent a Twitter out
[01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:35.000]  Ron Paul you know ate a hamburger once or he got a crooked toenail I mean it's
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:41.600]  just as much ado about nothing Psyops and we're gonna look into it but even the
[01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:44.120]  people on the Glenbeck side are not buying it and that's just one of the
[01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:50.240]  places Dallas newspapers have got it D magazines got it and we'll look into it
[01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:54.680]  and give me the breaking intel on that front up at drudgereport.com they have
[01:36:54.680 --> 01:37:00.880]  our article DHS officers armed with semi-automatic setup unannounced ID
[01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:05.120]  checkpoint oh by the way again Ventura doesn't drink and that was a story about
[01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:10.080]  I don't even drink I'm at a bar I'm knocked out I who are these people I
[01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:15.120]  think it's a Psyop but DHS officers armed with semi-automatic setup
[01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:21.400]  unannounced ID checkpoint in Florida I mean with machine guns so we'll be
[01:37:21.400 --> 01:37:25.200]  looking at that after Dr. Roberts leaves us Dr. Paul Craig Roberts is the best
[01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:28.560]  selling author former editor at the Wall Street Journal he has a new great
[01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:32.720]  website they've launched Paul Craig Roberts dot org he was the head of
[01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:37.520]  policy at Treasury number two position to Ronald Reagan as the father of
[01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:41.240]  Reaganomics and he's a recognized one of the top ten economist out there we
[01:37:41.240 --> 01:37:45.200]  won't go over all of his laurels and international awards and national
[01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:49.680]  awards he's gotten but he joins us briefly for the rest of the hour to
[01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:55.120]  break down all the incredible things that are happening the Iran buildup the
[01:37:55.120 --> 01:38:00.560]  NDAA the police state the the Obama power grabs with with recess
[01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:05.960]  appointments what's number one on your radar screen right now dr. Roberts well
[01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:10.640]  Alex you know it's the murder the public murder of the United States
[01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:17.360]  Constitution in full public view by both parties in Congress both houses and by
[01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:24.040]  the president and this is an amazing thing when they publicly repeal the
[01:38:24.040 --> 01:38:29.760]  Constitution and the bill arrives in a piece of legislation that has no
[01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:34.840]  justification whatsoever you know you could understand something like that
[01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:41.640]  Alex if every day a half a dozen shopping malls were blowing up if if people
[01:38:41.640 --> 01:38:45.880]  standing in the air lock in in the airports waiting to clear airport
[01:38:45.880 --> 01:38:51.360]  security if bombs were going off in the lines if if terrorists were running in
[01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:57.280]  and spraying the crowd with automatic weapons you know if the neocons were
[01:38:57.280 --> 01:39:03.040]  being assassinated in their homes if all of this was happening one could
[01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:08.560]  understand these kinds of really desperate measures but when nothing
[01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:13.000]  whatsoever is happening despite the fact the United States has been bombing
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:19.920]  and murdering mussels and six or more countries for the last ten years it
[01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:25.460]  hasn't been a single domestic act of terrorism in the United States since 9
[01:39:25.460 --> 01:39:31.200]  11 and you and I know what we think about that event so the whole thing you
[01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:36.520]  see has no justification and people just sit there and they've accepted the
[01:39:36.520 --> 01:39:41.680]  public murder of the United States Constitution what does this mean you
[01:39:41.680 --> 01:39:49.360]  know the Constitution is the result of about 800 years of struggle we inherited
[01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:53.960]  it from the British you know the the Bill of Rights this was something they
[01:39:53.960 --> 01:39:59.800]  achieved over a long period of time of struggle we inherited we enshrined it in
[01:39:59.800 --> 01:40:04.000]  the Constitution so that there would be limits on the government and so the
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:10.160]  government would be accountable to law and could not just arbitrarily do
[01:40:10.160 --> 01:40:16.200]  things to people well we've just allowed them to destroy this and there's no
[01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:21.280]  objection we of all the candidates all the visible candidates you know the
[01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:27.760]  Democrats and Republicans contending for the presidency only Ron Paul has made
[01:40:27.760 --> 01:40:33.880]  an issue of this what does this mean about us as a country so if we're going
[01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:39.840]  to let them murder the Constitution then sure we're going to let the Department
[01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:45.840]  of Homeland Security feel us up when we go through airports porno scanners post
[01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:52.720]  armed guards social security offices stop cars and trucks on the nation's
[01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:57.640]  highways and search them without warrants this is a police state I don't even
[01:40:57.640 --> 01:41:03.680]  think Hitler had a police state this thorough going or one that whose
[01:41:03.680 --> 01:41:09.600]  foundation has been so well prepared over the last 10 years so that's what's
[01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:14.480]  on on my mind you know who's doing anything about it other than the ACLU
[01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:19.960]  you know I know you talk about it I talk about it but we don't have any way of
[01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:26.000]  actually doing anything about it and the people seem to be accepting it well
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:30.880]  obviously throughout history governments that massively erode liberties the name of
[01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:34.400]  safety it's always that corrupt government system that is the true
[01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:40.840]  ultimate threat much more so than some foggy staged fake terror threat but
[01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:44.080]  but but here's the 64 million dollar question I want your perspective on
[01:41:44.080 --> 01:41:50.600]  Dr. Roberts why are they accelerating internet censorship and admitting it
[01:41:50.600 --> 01:41:54.520]  censorship even when the 80 inventors of the internet come out and say it's that
[01:41:54.520 --> 01:41:59.440]  Chinese style communist you know selective kill switch why are they
[01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:05.960]  admitting torture in DAA wireless so wiretapping all of this why are they
[01:42:05.960 --> 01:42:12.760]  moving so quickly right now and so openly what are they planning what are
[01:42:12.760 --> 01:42:17.120]  they doing this ahead of yes that's a that's a good question obviously they
[01:42:17.120 --> 01:42:22.280]  want to shut us up and stop the only access we have to any real information
[01:42:22.280 --> 01:42:26.680]  which is on the internet so what are they planning well they may be preparing
[01:42:26.680 --> 01:42:31.480]  for economic catastrophe there's obviously not an economic recovery it
[01:42:31.480 --> 01:42:35.640]  cannot be an economic recovery when you've moved the entire manufacturing
[01:42:35.640 --> 01:42:41.200]  sector offshore along with so many of the middle-class professional skill jobs
[01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:46.000]  so they've run out of the ability to keep the economy going with consumer debt
[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:49.280]  so there's no recovery what does that mean for the deficit it's going to be
[01:42:49.280 --> 01:42:53.720]  bigger the unemployment is going to be worse is going to be more protest more
[01:42:53.720 --> 01:43:01.840]  hardship so and the financial situation is is not has not been fixed and so the
[01:43:01.840 --> 01:43:07.200]  deteriorating economy will will renew all the pressures on the financial system
[01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:11.760]  so they're worried about all that they obviously are planning more walls they've
[01:43:11.760 --> 01:43:17.520]  got Syria in their sights they've got Iran in their sights even China they now
[01:43:17.520 --> 01:43:24.800]  talk about their war plans for China so they're they're preparing big things for
[01:43:24.800 --> 01:43:30.400]  us economic collapse at home more wars abroad and they want to be sure that we
[01:43:30.400 --> 01:43:37.000]  simply can't use the the internet and the various kinds of social information
[01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:42.600]  networks to get information or to oppose these developments that's right
[01:43:42.600 --> 01:43:47.240]  doctor you just put your finger directly on it that's why and I'm not a fan of the
[01:43:47.240 --> 01:43:51.160]  communist Chinese but the point is gent their president came out as you know a
[01:43:51.160 --> 01:43:55.960]  month ago and said we're preparing for war with the US it looks like they're
[01:43:55.960 --> 01:44:00.680]  going to try to encircle us the bases are being set up so prepare for war with
[01:44:00.680 --> 01:44:04.400]  the United States are the Russians who've not had an aggressive posture now
[01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:09.720]  having to say okay they're getting ready for war with us get ready it's gonna be
[01:44:09.720 --> 01:44:14.800]  hard for the Russians to do that because they have foolishly allowed these
[01:44:14.800 --> 01:44:20.240]  non-governmental organizations that are funded by the American endowment for
[01:44:20.240 --> 01:44:25.160]  democracy to come in and muck around in the elections and organize street
[01:44:25.160 --> 01:44:30.560]  protests and the Russians now are being seduced with membership in the World
[01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:35.960]  Trade Organization so that we are the I don't mean you and I but so that
[01:44:35.960 --> 01:44:42.320]  Washington or whoever is pulling all the strings so that they now have access
[01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:46.880]  to Russian leaders that they can purchase with money that's the way the
[01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:51.120]  United States controls the world it buys the leaders of all the other
[01:44:51.120 --> 01:44:57.480]  governments now it's unable to do that in China and in Iran but everywhere else
[01:44:57.480 --> 01:45:03.720]  it seems to have access and basically just purchases the leadership of those
[01:45:03.720 --> 01:45:08.800]  countries and so that the leaders of those countries no longer represent their
[01:45:08.800 --> 01:45:12.920]  own country their own people they represent Washington's interest I mean
[01:45:12.920 --> 01:45:20.400]  why else is NATO fighting American wars in Central Asia or North Africa there's
[01:45:20.400 --> 01:45:25.560]  nothing to do with NATO well they want part of that 500 billion in opium coming
[01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:31.360]  out of Afghanistan a year but but but looking at this now we openly having
[01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:35.000]  the aircraft carriers Trader Hormuz Iran threatening don't bring your carriers
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:40.440]  back US troops arriving in Israel for what Israel calls a deployment not a
[01:45:40.440 --> 01:45:47.720]  drill just just crazy crazy things happening and and I think you also get
[01:45:47.720 --> 01:45:49.800]  the nail on the head again when you pointed out whoever's pulling the
[01:45:49.800 --> 01:45:54.400]  strings this is not America this is not our government this is this global
[01:45:54.400 --> 01:45:58.360]  corporate consortium that that controls the United States like it controls
[01:45:58.360 --> 01:46:02.360]  others and and so what is the end game I mean as an economist with what's
[01:46:02.360 --> 01:46:08.640]  happening in Europe the acceleration of currency devaluations I mean if you were
[01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:13.040]  to step into their shoes their mindset what do you think their method of their
[01:46:13.040 --> 01:46:19.160]  madness is well you see the European banks were ruined by Wall Street all the
[01:46:19.160 --> 01:46:25.440]  junk securities that Wall Street saw them under false pretenses so that that
[01:46:25.440 --> 01:46:30.520]  damaged them and then and they now on top of that they have this sovereign debt
[01:46:30.520 --> 01:46:37.480]  crisis you know the Greek debt the Italian debt and what what weird what
[01:46:37.480 --> 01:46:44.240]  Washington is doing or whoever's pulling the strings is using the hype of the
[01:46:44.240 --> 01:46:50.080]  European sovereign debt crisis to strengthen the dollar to drive down the
[01:46:50.080 --> 01:46:55.360]  euro and drive down gold and silver and strengthen the dollar so that they can
[01:46:55.360 --> 01:47:02.120]  pull off this next big war front that they've got planned so and the reason
[01:47:02.120 --> 01:47:07.360]  they're putting American troops and in Israel is that if they give Israel the
[01:47:07.360 --> 01:47:16.240]  green light to attack Iran and Iran retaliates the retaliation will probably
[01:47:16.240 --> 01:47:20.040]  hit some of the American troops who have been stationed around Israel and then
[01:47:20.040 --> 01:47:25.680]  that gives Washington a reason to join in the war I was about to say there that I
[01:47:25.680 --> 01:47:29.600]  have the reporter they're peppering them at all of the main bases the Iranians
[01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:35.080]  are sure to hit yeah right so so watch them can say oh they killed our soldiers
[01:47:35.080 --> 01:47:43.360]  and and be off to war so I think that all of that is what's what's in the
[01:47:43.360 --> 01:47:50.000]  cards and people will sit without good information unless the whole country
[01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:55.480]  watches you a few other places and they'll sit without good information
[01:47:55.480 --> 01:48:01.440]  and be sucked into into another hoax and it's getting more and more dangerous
[01:48:01.440 --> 01:48:11.280]  because I think the the Chinese and the Russians didn't get too disturbed about
[01:48:11.280 --> 01:48:16.480]  Iraq and Afghanistan they may have seen that as a way of letting the Americans
[01:48:16.480 --> 01:48:21.240]  get themselves into a mess and and bankrupt the government's budget and
[01:48:21.240 --> 01:48:25.920]  so on but it's now getting closer and closer to them you see as we've talked
[01:48:25.920 --> 01:48:32.880]  before the the overthrow of Gaddafi the the war against Libya this was directed
[01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:38.480]  at the Chinese oil investments in eastern Libya the the setup of Syria is
[01:48:38.480 --> 01:48:46.000]  directed at the Russian naval base in Syria and when they if they hit Iran as
[01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:51.560]  it certainly seems they intend to do with all the rhetoric this also threatens
[01:48:51.560 --> 01:48:59.640]  the Chinese investments in Iran and it is too close to Russia's borders so
[01:48:59.640 --> 01:49:09.000]  they're now really risking some kind of a nuclear encounter here with two powers
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:13.440]  either one of which can blow away the whole world and by the way with the
[01:49:13.440 --> 01:49:17.280]  Georgia conflict as you know sir on 888 the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
[01:49:17.280 --> 01:49:22.400]  Staff it was on European TV but not here top story in Europe rolled rolled up
[01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:27.160]  mobile missiles instead on TV okay we're gonna have to attack you with with
[01:49:27.160 --> 01:49:31.280]  medium-range missiles because NATO aircraft were landing to back it up and
[01:49:31.280 --> 01:49:35.160]  it won't be what other response do you do this show and it turned out psi
[01:49:35.160 --> 01:49:39.200]  Hirsch discovered Dick Cheney was probing Russia I mean these are just
[01:49:39.200 --> 01:49:43.120]  crazy people that get off on this stuff they already run the whole stinking
[01:49:43.120 --> 01:49:48.160]  world why do they have to just keep grabbing and grabbing and grabbing you
[01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:56.560]  know they've been they've been mad ever since ever since the Joint Chiefs
[01:49:56.560 --> 01:50:02.640]  couldn't get John F Kennedy in the early 60s to do a preemptive nuclear attack on
[01:50:02.640 --> 01:50:10.920]  the Soviet Union the Joint Chiefs and the CIA had worked out that the that the
[01:50:10.920 --> 01:50:15.480]  Russians would not have the wherewithal to respond but that they were quickly
[01:50:15.480 --> 01:50:22.040]  gaining and that we needed to strike right away to negate Soviet power and
[01:50:22.040 --> 01:50:29.040]  Kennedy next it and they've been angry ever since and they got more and more
[01:50:29.040 --> 01:50:33.520]  angry about the bit now more about losing the bit now more tell what doctor

[01:54:17.560 --> 01:54:21.720]  manipulation and tampering by the way we have Carl Rowe of a clip coming up
[01:54:21.720 --> 01:54:25.800]  where he just talks about the fact they had a gentleman's agreement with all
[01:54:25.800 --> 01:54:30.360]  the key caucuses there and decided that Santorum came in second wait till I have
[01:54:30.360 --> 01:54:33.480]  played that clip played on the nightly news last night but I'll get to that
[01:54:33.480 --> 01:54:38.440]  coming up in the next hour Dr. Roberts we were going to break there and you were
[01:54:38.440 --> 01:54:42.400]  bringing up the fact of the joint Jesus staff Curtis LeMay of course LL
[01:54:42.400 --> 01:54:46.240]  Evanister on record they wanted Northwoods and it turns out that one of
[01:54:46.240 --> 01:54:50.200]  their chief adjuncts became the boss of Dick Cheney and they all learned about
[01:54:50.200 --> 01:54:55.240]  COG and taught George Herbert Walker Bush about how great martial law could
[01:54:55.240 --> 01:55:02.920]  be to bring in a takeover probably yeah well I think we kind of covered that
[01:55:02.920 --> 01:55:06.400]  you wanted to get on to the economy yeah just briefly I will what do you see
[01:55:06.400 --> 01:55:13.000]  there well there can't be a recovery because it's the economy has been moved off shore and we
[01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:16.520]  have very high unemployment we have a huge employment deficit over the last
[01:55:16.520 --> 01:55:24.440]  10 years and and so far the dollar is holding together because the government
[01:55:24.440 --> 01:55:28.880]  has been operating against the bullion markets and it's using all this hype
[01:55:28.880 --> 01:55:36.360]  about a European debt crisis to keep the euro down but you've got to figure
[01:55:36.360 --> 01:55:42.640]  what what do they do when the economy worsens unemployment rises the tax
[01:55:42.640 --> 01:55:47.440]  revenues fall more the deficit gets bigger they've got to be able to sell
[01:55:47.440 --> 01:55:51.200]  these bonds somewhere and if there's no market for them then the Federal Reserve
[01:55:51.200 --> 01:55:55.200]  buys them that is it monetizes and it creates new money to pay for them
[01:55:55.200 --> 01:56:00.000]  sooner or later all that new money will find its way into the economy and drive
[01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:06.240]  up prices or else the constant monetization of debt will cause the
[01:56:06.240 --> 01:56:11.160]  rest of the world to give up on the dollar and that this in my view is the
[01:56:11.160 --> 01:56:17.080]  real check on Washington's power or on the power of those pulling the strings
[01:56:17.080 --> 01:56:23.040]  at some point there's going to be too many dollar claims for the value of the
[01:56:23.040 --> 01:56:29.440]  dollar to support it and it's going to bite the dust and when that happens so
[01:56:29.440 --> 01:56:39.840]  does the power of Washington and I think that is a more likely thing to curtail
[01:56:39.840 --> 01:56:45.880]  the developments that we don't like than any sort of internal political reform
[01:56:45.880 --> 01:56:52.200]  but they still have their nuclear weapons and Israel has them and in the
[01:56:52.200 --> 01:56:56.720]  final equation that's what is being counted on here is just holding everybody
[01:56:56.720 --> 01:57:02.920]  hostage I'm actually in the in the process of writing about the economic
[01:57:02.920 --> 01:57:08.440]  outlook for this new year I interrupted it to come on to your program but this
[01:57:08.440 --> 01:57:14.520]  article will soon be posted on my site Paul Craig Roberts or and if it's not
[01:57:14.520 --> 01:57:21.440]  up it probably up tomorrow assuming I'm I'm able to finish writing it and I'm
[01:57:21.440 --> 01:57:28.880]  going to go through all the aspects that have essentially destroyed the economic
[01:57:28.880 --> 01:57:35.120]  capability of the economy and and and ruin the prospect for at least 90% of
[01:57:35.120 --> 01:57:40.160]  the American population and when like when your own government your own
[01:57:40.160 --> 01:57:46.640]  corporations and your own pundits and your own economists do this to you you
[01:57:46.640 --> 01:57:51.480]  really don't have a whole lot of reason to be loyal to them yes and they're
[01:57:51.480 --> 01:57:56.000]  building a giant armed camp against us they treat us like their enemies I
[01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:59.040]  mean this is or not even like their enemies like we're cattle in their
[01:57:59.040 --> 01:58:05.360]  wolves well we're I guess we're just their prey you can see this very well
[01:58:05.360 --> 01:58:11.960]  in the attitudes of local police toward local citizens it is really out of
[01:58:11.960 --> 01:58:14.760]  control and of course those little police are helping go along with the
[01:58:14.760 --> 01:58:18.200]  destruction of our own system a lot of police are waking up Dr. Roberts
[01:58:18.200 --> 01:58:23.280]  congratulations on launching your site and we'll talk to you very soon thank
[01:58:23.280 --> 01:58:27.720]  you Alex I enjoy being with you enjoy having you have a great new year into

[01:58:31.560 --> 01:58:35.480]  show tonight by the way we're gonna look at government developed cancer viruses
[01:58:35.480 --> 01:58:48.760]  with a top expert infowars nightly news seven o'clock tonight you are listening to GCN visit GCN live.com today
[01:58:49.760 --> 01:58:53.720]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[01:58:53.720 --> 01:58:58.080]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[01:58:58.080 --> 01:59:02.240]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[01:59:02.240 --> 01:59:06.320]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[01:59:06.320 --> 01:59:10.200]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[01:59:10.200 --> 01:59:14.480]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:59:14.480 --> 01:59:18.640]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[01:59:18.640 --> 01:59:22.960]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[01:59:22.960 --> 01:59:26.640]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[01:59:26.640 --> 01:59:30.840]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[01:59:30.840 --> 01:59:34.200]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution

[02:00:51.800 --> 02:00:57.480]  hey Alex just want to say my friends are really proud of what you're doing
[02:00:57.480 --> 02:01:00.280]  and we support you all the way man well thank you couldn't do it without your
[02:01:00.280 --> 02:01:06.560]  support my friend okay well I have a statement and a question as well I just
[02:01:06.560 --> 02:01:09.840]  want to say that I was one of the young black guy
[02:01:09.840 --> 02:01:13.880]  get on board with Obama since 2008 I was one of those guys who jumped the
[02:01:13.880 --> 02:01:17.560]  Kool-Aid you know back then and you know thought he was gonna be this miracle guy
[02:01:17.560 --> 02:01:21.840]  and all this stuff and I you know just over the years just watching his agenda
[02:01:21.840 --> 02:01:27.000]  I really decided that I'm gonna have to come on board with Ryan Paul and you
[02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:31.600]  know I just after the NDAA it really was a last straw for me I really see what
[02:01:31.600 --> 02:01:36.400]  kind of guy he really is well you know it's good to be loyal I mean I mean you
[02:01:36.400 --> 02:01:41.960]  see how bad somebody is like George W. Bush and you want to believe I mean I
[02:01:41.960 --> 02:01:45.240]  really don't want to believe Obama when he said in wars torture and all this then
[02:01:45.240 --> 02:01:49.920]  I saw the advisors he was getting and who was giving me money and I said folks
[02:01:49.920 --> 02:01:57.160]  it's gonna be a total con job and we were right but again I'm sorry go ahead
[02:01:57.160 --> 02:02:04.440]  and make your point yeah it was it was one thing I was watching on on cable
[02:02:04.440 --> 02:02:08.680]  news we was the Al Sharpton show on Tuesday and they were talking about Ryan
[02:02:08.680 --> 02:02:12.360]  Paul and he was saying that you know how the media has been trying to portray him
[02:02:12.360 --> 02:02:16.840]  as a racist and stuff and he was saying that Ryan Paul doesn't support the
[02:02:16.840 --> 02:02:21.280]  civil rights act of 1965 and that you know Rosa Parks would still be on the
[02:02:21.280 --> 02:02:24.920]  bus and that it kind of threw me off because I've been looking at Ryan Paul
[02:02:24.920 --> 02:02:27.800]  and I really want to support him you know I'm thinking of donating to his
[02:02:27.800 --> 02:02:32.120]  campaign and everything and I'm thinking like wow I mean it's well what's up
[02:02:32.120 --> 02:02:35.640]  with that you know I figured you know you'll be a good guy to you know talk to
[02:02:35.640 --> 02:02:39.920]  about it as well the problem the the problem with it is I can pull up what
[02:02:39.920 --> 02:02:44.160]  he actually stands for and and and Rand Paul said the same thing they're
[02:02:44.160 --> 02:02:50.200]  saying federal legislation like that over states that should be the states the
[02:02:50.200 --> 02:02:56.160]  state should all adopt legislation like that and he said that he would support
[02:02:56.160 --> 02:03:00.400]  it he's saying it's unconstitutional though because they use that then for
[02:03:00.400 --> 02:03:04.360]  other things like the sexual harassment stuff and the rest of it and now we've
[02:03:04.360 --> 02:03:09.000]  got the feds setting up checkpoints on highways and so that's a misrepresentation
[02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:12.720]  I mean I need to pull up his quotes and where he explains it all but no I mean
[02:03:12.720 --> 02:03:17.040]  it's like when they say he's against having a space program no he just
[02:03:17.040 --> 02:03:21.760]  explains that it should be done by the states or that it's not part of a Navy
[02:03:21.760 --> 02:03:26.840]  or a military and then it ends up being basically militarized so they it's like
[02:03:26.840 --> 02:03:29.680]  they they lie and say well he claims he's against the earmarks but he takes
[02:03:29.680 --> 02:03:33.120]  the money he votes against the earmarks but once the money comes the district
[02:03:33.120 --> 02:03:37.760]  of course he gets distributed so you can just I'll guarantee you that's one of
[02:03:37.760 --> 02:03:43.240]  the frequently asked questions on the Ron Paul 2012 website and you can go up
[02:03:43.240 --> 02:03:46.040]  there and look at that and next time I have Ron Paul on I'll bring that up to
[02:03:46.040 --> 02:03:51.120]  him but no that's one of their favorite things is to say that you know that they
[02:03:51.120 --> 02:03:54.720]  say he's against the federal government he doesn't want women to vote and it's
[02:03:54.720 --> 02:04:00.600]  basically just made up and perhaps I should problem is now here by the third
[02:04:00.600 --> 02:04:05.720]  hour I cracked my sternum last weekend so now I'm having them I'm kind of
[02:04:05.720 --> 02:04:08.580]  laboring here folks so I'm sorry but we'll get this hour done and I'll be

[02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:29.240]  board it seems like it's to the point where you know Ron Paul you look at all
[02:04:29.240 --> 02:04:33.160]  the other candidates then I mean you look at Obama it's like Ron Paul is the
[02:04:33.160 --> 02:04:38.760]  only way we got to go or else you know our house gonna break loose you're right

[02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:11.520]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that
[02:06:11.520 --> 02:06:15.280]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I have tremendous
[02:06:15.280 --> 02:06:20.280]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[02:06:20.280 --> 02:06:25.680]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[02:06:25.680 --> 02:06:30.600]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[02:06:30.600 --> 02:06:35.000]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:38.720]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more
[02:06:38.720 --> 02:06:42.680]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[02:06:42.680 --> 02:06:48.320]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the

[02:07:00.960 --> 02:07:04.920]  Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds
[02:07:04.920 --> 02:07:08.440]  and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that in a real
[02:07:08.440 --> 02:07:12.440]  meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold it's
[02:07:12.440 --> 02:07:15.880]  true seeds and all perform even gold and silver before in this country and it's
[02:07:15.880 --> 02:07:19.800]  possible that could even happen again so our friends at Solutions from Science
[02:07:19.800 --> 02:07:24.560]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival
[02:07:24.560 --> 02:07:29.560]  seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and
[02:07:29.560 --> 02:07:32.840]  your family and here's the best part these seeds have not been genetically
[02:07:32.840 --> 02:07:36.960]  modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre

[02:08:27.480 --> 02:08:31.320]  talk on any of these issues I wanted to get him on to get his perspective on
[02:08:31.320 --> 02:08:35.080]  anomalies in Iowa because I know he's been looking into those and reporting on
[02:08:35.080 --> 02:08:39.720]  it since we even had Bev Harrison is really the premier expert in election
[02:08:39.720 --> 02:08:46.600]  fraud a black box voting.org we've learned even more and in a moment after we
[02:08:46.600 --> 02:08:51.520]  get Greg's basic breakdown on this I'm gonna play a clip an audio clip it's a
[02:08:51.520 --> 02:08:56.960]  video clip for viewers a little piece that John Bowne put together for the
[02:08:56.960 --> 02:09:02.440]  Nightly News where it shows Ron Paul you know up at first place until the magic
[02:09:02.440 --> 02:09:08.320]  wand of Carl Rove is introduced and then magically he gets pulled back to third
[02:09:08.320 --> 02:09:12.880]  place and we're gonna play that clip of Carl Rove here in a moment saying oh
[02:09:12.880 --> 02:09:17.440]  well you know some of the key precincts got lost or didn't show up and you know
[02:09:17.440 --> 02:09:22.240]  there's missing people that had the votes they don't know where they are so
[02:09:22.240 --> 02:09:26.320]  they just had a gentleman's agreement and decided what level Santorum would go
[02:09:26.320 --> 02:09:29.960]  up to and then that's the final numbers this is hours before these numbers were
[02:09:29.960 --> 02:09:35.320]  even released this is the guy that called Florida for Bush when none the other
[02:09:35.320 --> 02:09:39.120]  networks did but when Carl Rove says so it makes it so and again I'm not a fan
[02:09:39.120 --> 02:09:45.000]  of Al Gore facts are facts so we'll get his take on this and then I want to move
[02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:50.560]  into some other subject with Greg Hunter the Iran situation the TSA setting up
[02:09:50.560 --> 02:09:53.600]  checkpoints all over the country we have another article out on it today
[02:09:53.600 --> 02:10:00.800]  setting up checkpoints checking IDs with machine guns MP5 heckler and coke nine
[02:10:00.800 --> 02:10:06.800]  millimeters in Florida DHS officers armor semi-automatic setup unannounced
[02:10:06.800 --> 02:10:11.640]  ID checkpoint in Leesburg Florida I mean we are living in the twilight zone here
[02:10:11.640 --> 02:10:15.560]  my report again is up at drudgereport.com easy place to find it some of the
[02:10:15.560 --> 02:10:23.720]  other news we have at infowars.com is the soldier army considering reprimanding
[02:10:23.720 --> 02:10:28.840]  soldier who appeared with Ron Paul now we got an extended interview with him that
[02:10:28.840 --> 02:10:35.320]  we premiered last night that one of our correspondents got with him after he was
[02:10:35.320 --> 02:10:39.440]  on CNN and they cut the feed then he went up and was on the stage with Ron Paul
[02:10:39.440 --> 02:10:43.360]  they got the interview after that and it may be one of the last times you hear
[02:10:43.360 --> 02:10:46.720]  from him because the US Army said Wednesday that it is considering
[02:10:46.720 --> 02:10:50.920]  disciplining Reserve Corporal Jesse Thorsten the soldier who spoke out
[02:10:50.920 --> 02:10:56.360]  against the a militaristic foreign policy at Ron Paul's post Iowa caucuses
[02:10:56.360 --> 02:11:00.080]  rally well I mean as a citizen he's allowed to talk about Ron Paul and
[02:11:00.080 --> 02:11:05.600]  supporting his view of military intervention and certainly shared by the
[02:11:05.600 --> 02:11:10.120]  former head of the Joint Chiefs Fox Fallon Mullen the outgoing guy and
[02:11:10.120 --> 02:11:13.400]  of course now Dempsey they finally hired somebody who will go along with it by the
[02:11:13.400 --> 02:11:17.040]  way Dempsey has all these weird quotes where he I don't know why we're in Iraq
[02:11:17.040 --> 02:11:21.560]  and I did say it no and but we're there and I like it you know just really weird
[02:11:21.560 --> 02:11:26.520]  stuff let's go ahead and blast our end so that's going on there we'll get his
[02:11:26.520 --> 02:11:33.960]  take on that as well but Greg Hunter runs USA watchdog.com a great news site
[02:11:33.960 --> 02:11:40.080]  and he's worked for ABC news CNN you name it nightly news all of it and
[02:11:40.080 --> 02:11:43.640]  brings all of that to his own research and reports there. Greg great to have
[02:11:43.640 --> 02:11:48.840]  you back with us here today what is your view and take on the big anomalies I
[02:11:48.840 --> 02:11:52.520]  know I've seen and others have witnessed including people that were in the caucuses
[02:11:52.520 --> 02:11:57.120]  who called in from Iowa yesterday what do you see happening there? Well from the
[02:11:57.120 --> 02:12:00.800]  very beginning I mean right at the beginning Ron Paul was up with 43% of
[02:12:00.800 --> 02:12:06.480]  the vote now that jives with most of the the reporting of the people going into
[02:12:06.480 --> 02:12:10.720]  the caucus goers going in saying they're going to vote for Ron Paul he
[02:12:10.720 --> 02:12:16.920]  was the clear front-runner going in and by a wide margin now you know I don't
[02:12:16.920 --> 02:12:20.240]  know what went on in the background but I think it's awful weird for a guy who
[02:12:20.240 --> 02:12:24.600]  was in what fifth or sixth place to shoot to the top with an eight-vote margin
[02:12:24.600 --> 02:12:30.120]  of second place on loss which is Santorum who Santorum was on Meet the Press
[02:12:30.120 --> 02:12:33.680]  and he was talking about he would degrade their facilities and I wanted
[02:12:33.680 --> 02:12:37.360]  David Gregory to say whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa now this is
[02:12:37.360 --> 02:12:44.840]  it like bombing Libya senator this is Iran has been basically put up as a
[02:12:44.840 --> 02:12:50.480]  line in the sand with China and China has said that they will come to Iran's
[02:12:50.480 --> 02:12:54.640]  rescue even if it causes World War 3 this is pretty widely reported Russia
[02:12:54.640 --> 02:12:58.880]  helps Iran with their nuclear facilities and I don't think Russia is very keen
[02:12:58.880 --> 02:13:04.320]  on allowing the United States to you know bomb Iran's facilities now they say
[02:13:04.320 --> 02:13:09.040]  Iran says it's for the new the peaceful production of energy and listen I'm
[02:13:09.040 --> 02:13:14.200]  American and I'm for the US and I'm for our troops and all that but just for an
[02:13:14.200 --> 02:13:21.880]  objective view Iran has a lot of of you know yellow cake and also uranium and
[02:13:21.880 --> 02:13:27.840]  it would be a real normal path for Iran to take to say hey we need to develop our
[02:13:27.840 --> 02:13:32.280]  nuclear resources they have a lot of uranium in Iran in the Middle East and
[02:13:32.280 --> 02:13:37.200]  they would also preserve their you know their fossil fuels that at one at some
[02:13:37.200 --> 02:13:41.760]  point in the future 40 years 50 years whatever will run out and some people
[02:13:41.760 --> 02:13:46.800]  say we shouldn't even be burning oil it's such a rare and it's such a unusual
[02:13:46.800 --> 02:13:50.160]  component that naturally occurs in the crust the earth that there are some
[02:13:50.160 --> 02:13:54.280]  scientists say we should keep it for fertilizer and for medicine and for for
[02:13:54.280 --> 02:13:59.760]  other things and just burn it our gas tank so that said you know this is not
[02:13:59.760 --> 02:14:04.480]  going to be like sending in some people to Libya who are former al-Qaeda I know
[02:14:04.480 --> 02:14:08.640]  it's been right a widely reported by everybody who's out there that LA
[02:14:08.640 --> 02:14:14.120]  Times BBC yes they were former guy who fought against coalition forces in
[02:14:14.120 --> 02:14:18.960]  Afghanistan was a leader in Libya we put him in Libya and so you know I was
[02:14:18.960 --> 02:14:22.680]  saying for you from the very beginning a they started a central bank right from
[02:14:22.680 --> 02:14:27.480]  the get-go just like that what happened to the 144 tons of gold that Gaddafi had
[02:14:27.480 --> 02:14:31.240]  wouldn't that be great to sell contracts but I guess they would know when they
[02:14:31.240 --> 02:14:35.040]  run short they just take your segregated counts and don't deliver your gold and
[02:14:35.040 --> 02:14:39.040]  silver like well I am F global and so but but you know that was a very weird
[02:14:39.040 --> 02:14:43.040]  thing we basically I mean you know your force or against us well unless you're
[02:14:43.040 --> 02:14:46.560]  taking out Gaddafi then you're you know then you're al-Qaeda it's okay so I
[02:14:46.560 --> 02:14:51.880]  understand that we supported al-Qaeda this NAD this NDA a bill that just
[02:14:51.880 --> 02:14:58.720]  passed specifically said al-Qaeda why are we supporting al-Qaeda in Libya why
[02:14:58.720 --> 02:15:02.600]  and back to the voting thing listen I don't know what happened there but all
[02:15:02.600 --> 02:15:07.720]  the report one things here's what the mainstream media does great they report
[02:15:07.720 --> 02:15:12.440]  on the moment television cable television mainstream media does a
[02:15:12.440 --> 02:15:17.440]  wonderful job if a bridge falls down if a hurricane comes up for an election and
[02:15:17.440 --> 02:15:21.040]  they did a wonderful job that night and they were polling caucus goers on the
[02:15:21.040 --> 02:15:25.920]  way in and all their revolts all their revolts all their resources and
[02:15:25.920 --> 02:15:29.160]  everybody that I watched said wow run Paul's gonna walk away and when the
[02:15:29.160 --> 02:15:33.760]  numbers first came up he was the exit polls look like 50% is what he should
[02:15:33.760 --> 02:15:38.160]  have gotten the entrance polls showed that but magically it didn't happen I
[02:15:38.160 --> 02:15:41.960]  want to expand on that but I want to play you a clip we should talk about why
[02:15:41.960 --> 02:15:46.320]  we should really talk about why absolutely but I want to get your take
[02:15:46.320 --> 02:15:51.360]  on this this was picked up by a couple of newspapers but but other than that I
[02:15:51.360 --> 02:15:55.800]  didn't get any attention this is from Fox News Carl Rove their correspondent
[02:15:55.800 --> 02:16:01.080]  talks about these key precincts with the missing votes and we were being told
[02:16:01.080 --> 02:16:04.560]  this before we knew about the Carl Rove comments and then they got in a room and
[02:16:04.560 --> 02:16:10.000]  had a gentleman's agreement and decided to boost Santorum by all these
[02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:14.720]  percentage points I mean this is a smoking gun where Carl Rove hides it in
[02:16:14.720 --> 02:16:19.400]  plain view the night of the election hours before these numbers even came out
[02:16:19.400 --> 02:16:26.560]  how is Carl Rove from Fox headquarters telling us this here is the clip Romney
[02:16:26.560 --> 02:16:31.520]  is gonna win the Iowa caucuses by 14 votes how solid is your evidence your
[02:16:31.520 --> 02:16:35.000]  room from a pretty good reliable source they made the correctionist story
[02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:46.280]  county which moved it from an 18 point margin for Santorum Clinton County he
[02:16:46.280 --> 02:16:51.480]  had the one outstanding precinct in the state and that it will show an 18 vote
[02:16:51.480 --> 02:16:57.160]  victory in that precinct for for Mitt Romney which will give him a statewide
[02:16:57.160 --> 02:17:04.080]  victory of 14 votes over you're saying that they basically have come to an
[02:17:04.080 --> 02:17:09.200]  agreement as to what they're gonna be in the official the person who's it got the
[02:17:09.200 --> 02:17:13.960]  official piece of paper is missing but the Romney and Santorum people who are
[02:17:13.960 --> 02:17:18.000]  monitoring it agree on what the number is they've barely rounded up the
[02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:21.600]  representatives of the camps who agreed yes we were there we know exactly what
[02:17:21.600 --> 02:17:27.640]  the vote total was and we both agreed to agree to what it was all right and
[02:17:27.640 --> 02:17:32.080]  again now we're gonna post that video clip up on the site of our computer
[02:17:32.080 --> 02:17:35.840]  shuttered a few times that's unedited though that's from Fox News what do you
[02:17:35.840 --> 02:17:42.320]  make of that I say that's he basically admitted that they decided between the
[02:17:42.320 --> 02:17:46.480]  two supposed front runners who was gonna win what if they bring Ron Paul in
[02:17:46.480 --> 02:17:50.800]  why did they bring newt gingrich in but once they all talk about it that's my
[02:17:50.800 --> 02:17:54.640]  question yeah that's a mind-boggling clip and it's not getting any attention the
[02:17:54.640 --> 02:18:01.800]  Tribune newspaper reported on it one long caucus one delayed official add
[02:18:01.800 --> 02:18:07.160]  up the late results from story County so it is confirmed here's the examiner
[02:18:07.160 --> 02:18:12.320]  out of the Washington Carl Rove Romney has won Iowa by 14 it just mentions it
[02:18:12.320 --> 02:18:19.240]  as a footnote here and this would have been enough these votes to push Paul at
[02:18:19.240 --> 02:18:24.560]  least into second place so so here they are admitting that they moved up Santorum
[02:18:24.560 --> 02:18:28.080]  in a gentleman's agreement because they don't know where the guy is you're
[02:18:28.080 --> 02:18:31.640]  supposed to call him in from each little caucus point you're not supposed to
[02:18:31.640 --> 02:18:35.640]  have them all in a truck going somewhere to be counted and look look where that
[02:18:35.640 --> 02:18:40.040]  came from that came from what Ames which is the the center which is also the
[02:18:40.040 --> 02:18:45.360]  place of Iowa State a big University with lots of young people and Ron Paul
[02:18:45.360 --> 02:18:50.760]  gets about what 50% of the young boat or morning how can you how can you even he
[02:18:50.760 --> 02:18:54.240]  was and listen to his speech and I like to be objective one person on my site
[02:18:54.240 --> 02:18:57.280]  because I said I wasn't stopping for Ron Paul and he says I don't know what does
[02:18:57.280 --> 02:19:00.200]  he need a halo over his head well you know listen I want to be objective if
[02:19:00.200 --> 02:19:04.240]  somebody's getting a bad shake if somebody's getting the short end of
[02:19:04.240 --> 02:19:07.600]  the stick I want to be objective enough to say hey I'm not one of his supporters
[02:19:07.600 --> 02:19:12.680]  and I don't support any candidate or any party I'm just trying to be objective
[02:19:12.680 --> 02:19:17.240]  and he's getting a bad shake I mean the evidence shows he's getting a bad shake
[02:19:17.240 --> 02:19:21.960]  and at least shows they should do an investigation on what happened in Iowa I
[02:19:21.960 --> 02:19:25.240]  mean they got a guy in a truck they don't have telephones they don't have fax
[02:19:25.240 --> 02:19:28.320]  machines up they don't have computers well they're supposed to call it in
[02:19:28.320 --> 02:19:31.920]  they're supposed to look it's amazing stay there we got to come back and talk
[02:19:31.920 --> 02:19:35.400]  more about this and it will probably play that clip one more time I think the
[02:19:35.400 --> 02:19:39.440]  guys gave it to us in a really high res and then our computers are run on a
[02:19:39.440 --> 02:19:42.960]  gerbil on a wheel so it was breaking up a bit but we're gonna try to come back
[02:19:42.960 --> 02:19:47.200]  and play that clip clean because it is so amazing but here's the news articles

[02:22:07.760 --> 02:22:11.320]  know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than
[02:22:11.320 --> 02:22:15.080]  silver or gold it's true seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in

[02:24:08.600 --> 02:24:12.440]  files that are as big as our nightly news computers can that's why that one was
[02:24:12.440 --> 02:24:17.440]  stuttering and so coming up the next day but we're gonna shrink that file down
[02:24:17.440 --> 02:24:21.560]  and be able to play that clean without a few stutters and because it was for the
[02:24:21.560 --> 02:24:26.680]  nightly news we had a little joke in the clip where where Carl Rove moves the
[02:24:26.680 --> 02:24:30.840]  horse of Ron Paul back and we have a clip from the Kentucky Derby where they
[02:24:30.840 --> 02:24:35.520]  say and out of nowhere and it shows Sam Turham just appear there at the front
[02:24:35.520 --> 02:24:40.280]  of the pack but we also have that clip raw we're gonna post an article at
[02:24:40.280 --> 02:24:47.240]  mfolwars.com but an amazing clip why would Carl Rove publicly talk about
[02:24:47.240 --> 02:24:50.960]  how there was a gentleman's agreement and how did he know this was going on
[02:24:50.960 --> 02:24:55.240]  before anybody else did and why would he talk about it I mean is it a case of
[02:24:55.240 --> 02:25:00.280]  hiding it in plain view I mean this is a guy well known for manipulating
[02:25:00.280 --> 02:25:07.520]  elections. I was going to me yes sir. Well you know I don't I don't know listen
[02:25:07.520 --> 02:25:12.040]  maybe he was feeling his oats maybe he thought he was saying enough to where he
[02:25:12.040 --> 02:25:17.360]  was covered I think he said enough just to cast doubt to cast real doubt now did
[02:25:17.360 --> 02:25:21.880]  they manipulate the votes we don't have actual evidence we don't have an actual
[02:25:21.880 --> 02:25:25.920]  person who was in the room and said yeah they miscounted the votes but boy all
[02:25:25.920 --> 02:25:33.920]  the all the evidence around supporting that Ron Paul was winning even on the
[02:25:33.920 --> 02:25:37.400]  election night from the you know the caucus goers the polls going inside I
[02:25:37.400 --> 02:25:40.560]  heard one one of the reporters say well you know they go in and they say they
[02:25:40.560 --> 02:25:43.480]  got a vote for one person but they can always change their mind well then they
[02:25:43.480 --> 02:25:47.080]  then you know thousands of people must to change their mind because he was very
[02:25:47.080 --> 02:25:51.280]  early on he was up by 43% and Romney wasn't even I only think he was in
[02:25:51.280 --> 02:25:56.040]  third place very early on in the very first time they started you know
[02:25:56.040 --> 02:26:00.240]  announcing you know who was in in what place and who was in the lead and I so
[02:26:00.240 --> 02:26:04.080]  you know I don't know but it's I know one thing I wish somebody in the mainstream
[02:26:04.080 --> 02:26:07.800]  media would just sit down with Karl Rove or Ed Rollins and you know all these
[02:26:07.800 --> 02:26:12.400]  of you know Mike Murphy and say okay tell us why you don't like Ron Paul
[02:26:12.400 --> 02:26:15.680]  because you have absolutely nothing good to say about him other than that he's
[02:26:15.680 --> 02:26:19.120]  got a lot of young people you'd like to get yeah and that's well and that's it
[02:26:19.120 --> 02:26:22.880]  either they ignore him or they're forced to cover him they twist things and
[02:26:22.880 --> 02:26:26.440]  attack him showing the power structure is scared and that's the question he
[02:26:26.440 --> 02:26:30.000]  been asking why are they so scared of him I want to go to that but here is the
[02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:34.800]  clip of Karl Rove and again the Tribune newspaper reported on this the
[02:26:34.800 --> 02:26:40.960]  Washington examiner one long caucus one delayed official add up to late results
[02:26:40.960 --> 02:26:46.880]  from Story County and there at Ames with that big university oops they had to
[02:26:46.880 --> 02:26:50.920]  put all those different precincts in a truck it disappears and Karl Rove
[02:26:50.920 --> 02:26:55.480]  doesn't know where it is but they had a gentleman's agreement and Santorum moved
[02:26:55.480 --> 02:27:01.240]  up I mean this is incredible here it is Romney is gonna win the Iowa caucuses
[02:27:01.240 --> 02:27:05.640]  by 14 votes but how solid is your evidence you're from a pretty good
[02:27:05.640 --> 02:27:09.400]  reliable sort they made the correction at Story County which moved it from an
[02:27:09.400 --> 02:27:14.560]  18-point margin for Santorum to a 4-point a 4-vote margin for Santorum
[02:27:14.560 --> 02:27:18.400]  Clinton County have the one outstanding precinct in the state and that it will
[02:27:18.400 --> 02:27:25.360]  show an 18 vote victory in that precinct for for Mitt Romney which will give him
[02:27:25.360 --> 02:27:32.240]  a statewide victory of 14 votes over I don't understand you're saying that they
[02:27:32.240 --> 02:27:35.840]  basically have come to an agreement as to what they're gonna be and the
[02:27:35.840 --> 02:27:40.880]  official the person who's it got the official piece of paper is missing but
[02:27:40.880 --> 02:27:45.440]  the Romney and Santorum people who are monitoring it agree on what the number is
[02:27:45.440 --> 02:27:48.760]  they've apparently rounded up the representatives of the camp to have
[02:27:48.760 --> 02:27:51.880]  agreed yes we were there we know exactly what the vote total was and we both
[02:27:51.880 --> 02:27:57.280]  agree to agree to what it was all right and Greg Hunter of USA Watchdog
[02:27:57.280 --> 02:28:00.640]  investigative journalist joins us this is a short segment one to break we're
[02:28:00.640 --> 02:28:04.400]  gonna come back and cover a bunch of other issues with you but but I mean
[02:28:04.400 --> 02:28:07.960]  continue with your breakdown of this well two things number one they said
[02:28:07.960 --> 02:28:12.960]  well we he said first Romney and Santorum then they rounded up the
[02:28:12.960 --> 02:28:16.080]  representatives of the camp like is if they talk to other people they didn't I
[02:28:16.080 --> 02:28:18.520]  don't think that's not what it sounds like to me that's number one number two
[02:28:18.520 --> 02:28:24.240]  as an investigative reporter I always had to make a decision to protect a
[02:28:24.240 --> 02:28:27.640]  source or not protect the source because you always want to name your sources
[02:28:27.640 --> 02:28:31.320]  and if somebody is talking about hey wow there's this new report that says a
[02:28:31.320 --> 02:28:34.760]  depleted uranium will cause cancer and I'll lose my job at the Defense
[02:28:34.760 --> 02:28:38.480]  Department and that they'll prosecute me for you know being a traitor that I
[02:28:38.480 --> 02:28:42.720]  have to protect that source okay and you what you want to make sure you protect
[02:28:42.720 --> 02:28:46.920]  but if it's somebody in a public election you want to know about the good
[02:28:46.920 --> 02:28:50.520]  old boy meeting what the source out there what's the source you know you know
[02:28:50.520 --> 02:28:55.200]  and listen Chris Wallace is a son of Mike Wallace who's done all kinds of
[02:28:55.200 --> 02:29:00.680]  investigative reporting knows better than that and you say from a pretty good
[02:29:00.680 --> 02:29:05.440]  source well what source is that why didn't he say what source is that who's
[02:29:05.440 --> 02:29:09.720]  the source there's no reason you will protect that source who's the source
[02:29:09.720 --> 02:29:14.720]  well just a pretty good source uh really who now they were just gonna let him
[02:29:14.720 --> 02:29:19.840]  have the inside baseball there and hide it in plain view so that we don't know
[02:29:19.840 --> 02:29:24.320]  to who go talk to that source as well they're just hoarding the sources because
[02:29:24.320 --> 02:29:29.480]  they don't want us to know who knows if it's if the source is you know who knows
[02:29:29.480 --> 02:29:32.600]  who knows who the source is well that's a sign they don't want you know the
[02:29:32.600 --> 02:29:35.880]  source is yeah there's more hanky-panky stay there let's finish up on the
[02:29:35.880 --> 02:29:41.200]  election looking forward and then more on Iran and phone calls with our guest

[02:33:21.200 --> 02:33:26.920]  here today the toll-free number to join us is 800 25 at 9 9 231 I know we've had
[02:33:26.920 --> 02:33:31.080]  callers holding before he joined us but he could certainly talk about pretty
[02:33:31.080 --> 02:33:34.520]  much any issue out there he's a very well researched a gentleman but if you
[02:33:34.520 --> 02:33:37.480]  guys bring up kind of side topics I won't even really have anything to say
[02:33:37.480 --> 02:33:42.320]  because I mainly focused on the economy what's happening and I ran the
[02:33:42.320 --> 02:33:46.560]  unfolding police state and the rest of it every few months I've always done
[02:33:46.560 --> 02:33:55.000]  this in my 17 years on air I do satirical skits global love cop a guy dressed up
[02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:59.520]  in a stormtrooper outfit telling you how great the police state is or I did a
[02:33:59.520 --> 02:34:02.240]  thing with John Corzine you know saying I'm not gonna tell you where the money
[02:34:02.240 --> 02:34:07.000]  went you know with it with a banker top hat dressed up like the monopoly man and
[02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:11.720]  I've done a new one it's up and in full wars calm and present body calm I it we
[02:34:11.720 --> 02:34:17.520]  did it on the nightly news last night Cobra commander for president and I'm
[02:34:17.520 --> 02:34:21.560]  illustrating in the piece that our government's doing everything that
[02:34:21.560 --> 02:34:29.520]  cartoon villains would do secret arrest torture preemptive war and so Cobra
[02:34:29.520 --> 02:34:33.640]  commander announces he's gonna run for president and I got the idea seeing the
[02:34:33.640 --> 02:34:37.520]  trailer for the new Cobra car movie coming out which is really just a
[02:34:37.520 --> 02:34:43.640]  military recruitment film where Cobra this international terrorist group
[02:34:43.640 --> 02:34:47.200]  takes over the White House and so I'm basically speaking from the White House
[02:34:47.200 --> 02:34:51.600]  I see commenters there saying Alex where did you get the giant Cobra throne
[02:34:51.600 --> 02:34:58.000]  folks that's blue screen I somebody mailed me to Cobra commander outfits
[02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:01.320]  because I've done a joke about Cobra commander a few months ago so I thought
[02:35:01.320 --> 02:35:06.200]  well I've got these I see this I'll do a skit with this and some people it's got
[02:35:06.200 --> 02:35:12.360]  852 likes to 48 dislikes and some people are in there you know since it went up
[02:35:12.360 --> 02:35:16.720]  last night and they're saying Alex this this is a joke you shouldn't joke around
[02:35:16.720 --> 02:35:23.680]  really Rush Limbaugh didn't joke around on his TV show and do satire really
[02:35:23.680 --> 02:35:28.480]  Anderson Cooper didn't get a half-naked woman with him on his news show to get
[02:35:28.480 --> 02:35:32.840]  ratings that's not what I'm doing when something satire once every two three
[02:35:32.840 --> 02:35:37.240]  four months it's clearly that and of course that's just a talking point to
[02:35:37.240 --> 02:35:46.840]  attack us most people I guess 20 to 1 yeah 20 to 1 or so like it it's funny
[02:35:46.840 --> 02:35:51.640]  it's goofy and it's gallows humor we can't just sit up here and be serious
[02:35:51.640 --> 02:35:56.960]  about this all day or we go crazy now we do have a serious video on the india
[02:35:56.960 --> 02:36:00.720]  it's got close to a half million views that I shot from home right after
[02:36:00.720 --> 02:36:09.720]  Obama signed it there on New Year's Eve so no one would notice and I have a new
[02:36:09.720 --> 02:36:19.600]  one that we also just aired today and posted titled the NDA is a hoax you
[02:36:19.600 --> 02:36:23.840]  cannot legalize tyranny Marbury versus Madison anything repugnant the
[02:36:23.840 --> 02:36:28.200]  Constitution is no one void any law the could they have laws again saying black
[02:36:28.200 --> 02:36:33.640]  people are slaves no but and if they tried to pass those laws we would stand
[02:36:33.640 --> 02:36:37.800]  against them they're illegitimate that let's shift gears into the NDA because
[02:36:37.800 --> 02:36:43.720]  I know you've written about this over at your USA Watchdog news site when you
[02:36:43.720 --> 02:36:47.960]  look at this when you see this kind of stuff happening why do you think same
[02:36:47.960 --> 02:36:51.760]  question why are they cheating Ron Paul clearly in the coverage and how much the
[02:36:51.760 --> 02:36:57.560]  timing gets in debates all sorts of evidence of fraud in Iowa why are they
[02:36:57.560 --> 02:37:00.600]  doing that to Ron Paul but also why are they saying they want to censor the
[02:37:00.600 --> 02:37:04.760]  internet now and validating our position and proving we were right why are they
[02:37:04.760 --> 02:37:11.360]  getting so naked about their tyranny so brazen so hubris filled or is it an
[02:37:11.360 --> 02:37:16.400]  attempt to flee forward and is it desperation why are they saying we'll
[02:37:16.400 --> 02:37:20.120]  secretly arrest citizens we'll have worldwide combat including in America
[02:37:20.120 --> 02:37:24.600]  will in posse commentatus why is that happening Greg Hunter well I'll answer
[02:37:24.600 --> 02:37:27.920]  your question with a question what are they getting ready for what are they
[02:37:27.920 --> 02:37:31.320]  doing a checkpoints in Florida I think they're practicing what are they doing
[02:37:31.320 --> 02:37:36.120]  at the FEMA camps I think they're gonna need camps because I think we're headed
[02:37:36.120 --> 02:37:41.040]  for a an economic collapse and I'm not the only one that said that there's a
[02:37:41.040 --> 02:37:44.680]  guy by the name of Ray Dalio who runs Bridgewater Bridgewater Associates or
[02:37:44.680 --> 02:37:48.560]  Capital I can't remember it's a big hedge for Bridgewater is an 80 to 100
[02:37:48.560 --> 02:37:52.920]  billion dollar hedge fund his name is Ray Dalio and several months ago he said
[02:37:52.920 --> 02:37:56.640]  he thinks the collapse an economic financial collapse will happen at the
[02:37:56.640 --> 02:38:01.760]  end of 12 or the beginning of 13 now he also thought that we'd have a collapse
[02:38:01.760 --> 02:38:07.040]  in 2008 which we did I also said in 2008 in March all the banks were in
[02:38:07.040 --> 02:38:10.480]  trouble I've been saying that for for months before that all of the banks
[02:38:10.480 --> 02:38:13.600]  were in trouble this is in March of 08 and of course we didn't have the
[02:38:13.600 --> 02:38:16.960]  collapse until what October and so but it looked at me like at CNN like I had
[02:38:16.960 --> 02:38:20.920]  two heads like what do you mean well as it turns out you know you know they
[02:38:20.920 --> 02:38:24.200]  they did collapse well my question is what are they getting ready for and I
[02:38:24.200 --> 02:38:27.880]  think they're getting ready for some sort of collapse and if they bomb Iran
[02:38:27.880 --> 02:38:33.560]  like Rick Santorum wants to do like some many of the neocons want to do it's
[02:38:33.560 --> 02:38:37.840]  not going to be as simple as people think can our Navy defeat the Iranian
[02:38:37.840 --> 02:38:42.440]  Navy without question our Navy is though is probably the best in the world bar
[02:38:42.440 --> 02:38:45.400]  now that doesn't mean that our Navy won't take some big hits I mean the
[02:38:45.400 --> 02:38:49.640]  Chinese I'm sure have sold Iran these are missiles that go that are shipped a
[02:38:49.640 --> 02:38:53.920]  carrier destroying missiles that fly about three feet off the water and can
[02:38:53.920 --> 02:38:57.600]  take take out a carrier at a few hundred miles and you know the Persian Gulf is
[02:38:57.600 --> 02:39:01.440]  only a few hundred miles wide at this widest point maybe and maybe three or
[02:39:01.440 --> 02:39:04.000]  four hundred miles long it's not that big really sun and ocean it's not like
[02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:08.880]  hiding out in the Indian Ocean and so it is so Ken the other thing is is that if
[02:39:08.880 --> 02:39:12.640]  we if we have this warfare with Iran they're not going to pull up you know
[02:39:12.640 --> 02:39:18.760]  the the the USS Iranian excuse me the Iranian you know battleship and have a
[02:39:18.760 --> 02:39:22.720]  broadside I mean we're not going to be doing that and they don't have aircraft
[02:39:22.720 --> 02:39:27.160]  carriers and they don't have battleships and an aegis missile cruisers what they
[02:39:27.160 --> 02:39:32.440]  do have our guys in speedboats with RPGs and torpedoes and asymmetrical warfare
[02:39:32.440 --> 02:39:37.560]  and how much asymmetrical warfare does it take for people who own a ships full
[02:39:37.560 --> 02:39:41.360]  of oil to say I did that I'm not going to take my ship through this 30 miles
[02:39:41.360 --> 02:39:45.920]  straight so even if they don't shut it down completely and and of course you
[02:39:45.920 --> 02:39:49.280]  know could you know former secretary Cohen said that that the other cannot
[02:39:49.280 --> 02:39:52.480]  shut down the straight one maybe they can't but they can sure slow down some
[02:39:52.480 --> 02:39:57.600]  oil flow and what is that anywhere from about 30 to 40% of the world's oil a year
[02:39:57.600 --> 02:40:01.240]  and it's they're not and they've been working on this for a while
[02:40:01.240 --> 02:40:04.640]  hold on just a minute I'm just gonna get rid of that they've been now working on
[02:40:04.640 --> 02:40:10.920]  this for a while you know they've been practicing yeah this is an Iraq who was
[02:40:10.920 --> 02:40:16.920]  under a 15 years of sanctioned and have been carpet bombed before that and an
[02:40:16.920 --> 02:40:21.800]  unpopular dictator the Iranians up against u.s. British and Israeli funding as
[02:40:21.800 --> 02:40:25.560]  you know and the tens of billions over 50 billion total us give them 35 billion
[02:40:25.560 --> 02:40:31.720]  and even USCIA advisors and satellite help over a million what and a half
[02:40:31.720 --> 02:40:37.440]  Iranians died 300,000 Iraqis I mean the Iranians do have their you know what
[02:40:37.440 --> 02:40:41.880]  together well listen they're gonna fight they've been planning this for a long
[02:40:41.880 --> 02:40:46.120]  time and what I want to say to people is hey listen if it's going to be a you
[02:40:46.120 --> 02:40:49.640]  know something that is in the interest of the world an interest of the United
[02:40:49.640 --> 02:40:53.520]  States of America and we're gonna go to war it's not gonna be just the Iranians
[02:40:53.520 --> 02:40:58.280]  the I said this earlier that the Chinese have publicly stated in no uncertain
[02:40:58.280 --> 02:41:02.640]  terms that they will side with Iran even if it means World War three they said
[02:41:02.640 --> 02:41:06.040]  that on Chinese television it's on my side well they said it about exactly
[02:41:06.040 --> 02:41:10.240]  they said it about Pakistan too I mean this is really making the warlines draw
[02:41:10.240 --> 02:41:14.560]  and we're all run by hedge fund managers like Corzine who makes 40 to one bets
[02:41:14.560 --> 02:41:19.360]  with other people's money I mean these guys are in control but I think they
[02:41:19.360 --> 02:41:24.440]  they are irrationally exuberant I think they are clinically insane well listen
[02:41:24.440 --> 02:41:28.120]  I think it's the you know that the supposedly of the seven deadly sins the
[02:41:28.120 --> 02:41:32.200]  sin of pride is the worst and the most destructive why because when you're
[02:41:32.200 --> 02:41:36.360]  prideful and you know when you think that you're invincible boy you're setting
[02:41:36.360 --> 02:41:39.600]  yourself up to be knocked off that fine white charger and you're setting
[02:41:39.600 --> 02:41:44.040]  yourself up to get a big pie in the face and our economy is fragile at best I
[02:41:44.040 --> 02:41:47.720]  mean if nothing else happened from here on out maybe maybe we could grow our way
[02:41:47.720 --> 02:41:51.560]  out of it but I don't think we can that's why all the military top generals in
[02:41:51.560 --> 02:41:56.040]  the U.S. and Israel and England are saying don't do it but they're going ahead
[02:41:56.040 --> 02:42:00.640]  with it why are all the generals except for one guy they found Dempsey now and
[02:42:00.640 --> 02:42:04.120]  and and and they all and the former head of them Israeli military the former
[02:42:04.120 --> 02:42:07.760]  Mossad head who they had to get rid of because they're not for this why from
[02:42:07.760 --> 02:42:10.960]  your research I know you've covered this a lot why are they telling them don't do
[02:42:10.960 --> 02:42:15.160]  it why are they calling it a catastrophe they know what's going to be a mess I
[02:42:15.160 --> 02:42:23.200]  mean Alex how long can Americans stand 8 or 10 or 12 dollar oil in few lines like
[02:42:23.200 --> 02:42:26.640]  we had in the 70s you know the 70s we had a really strong country we didn't
[02:42:26.640 --> 02:42:30.280]  have but what a half a billion a half a trillion dollar deficit maybe in the
[02:42:30.280 --> 02:42:34.400]  70s 300 billion dollars in the 70s we could take a hit in the 90s we could
[02:42:34.400 --> 02:42:38.760]  take a hit we're not set up to take a hit when we had this massive bailout where
[02:42:38.760 --> 02:42:42.520]  the Federal Reserve which incidentally they get hardly any coverage of that
[02:42:42.520 --> 02:42:46.520]  government accountability office nailed sixteen point two trillion dollars that
[02:42:46.520 --> 02:42:50.920]  got pumped out to bail out domestic and foreign banks domestic and foreign
[02:42:50.920 --> 02:42:54.880]  countries companies who knows how much got paid back they say most of it's been
[02:42:54.880 --> 02:42:59.680]  paid back a defined most and you we can't audit the Fed so who knows what
[02:42:59.680 --> 02:43:02.440]  happened who do they pick as a winner and who do they pick as a loser
[02:43:02.440 --> 02:43:06.040]  evidently they pecked MF global as a loser but anyway the long insured is
[02:43:06.040 --> 02:43:11.480]  is is they don't the generals know that this is a giant mess this is not going
[02:43:11.480 --> 02:43:15.640]  to be like you know force a and force b meeting each other on the battlefield
[02:43:15.640 --> 02:43:19.360]  oh no no this is going to be say asymmetrical warfare this is going to be
[02:43:19.360 --> 02:43:23.520]  you know Hezbollah is going to be turned loose in the north you know which is I
[02:43:23.520 --> 02:43:27.000]  think part of the reason why they want to knock out Syria Hamas is going to be
[02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:31.880]  turned loose in the south Israel is going to be under you know major attack the
[02:43:31.880 --> 02:43:35.240]  other thing is and I was thinking about this is that there at this point if
[02:43:35.240 --> 02:43:38.960]  Israel does and I think they do it's been widely reported they have two to
[02:43:38.960 --> 02:43:45.080]  300 nuclear weapons well then we can't let Israel fall into the hands of Hamas
[02:43:45.080 --> 02:43:51.040]  or Hezbollah now can we they can't get a hold they can't be overrun if they are
[02:43:51.040 --> 02:43:55.480]  overrun then who gets control of the two or 300 nuclear weapons that that Israel
[02:43:55.480 --> 02:44:00.240]  reportedly possesses well we're kind of stuck there no the elite are causing a
[02:44:00.240 --> 02:44:05.280]  giant crisis exactly as you said to distract from the economic implosion
[02:44:05.280 --> 02:44:09.080]  which is actually a mega bank takeover I think they're going to have the
[02:44:09.080 --> 02:44:13.000]  implosion anyway I think they know mathematically at this point we might as
[02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:17.080]  well print money we're going to have the implosion let's buy time as long as we
[02:44:17.080 --> 02:44:20.840]  can to prepare that's what I think and other people say the same thing I mean
[02:44:20.840 --> 02:44:24.520]  we never fixed you know this whole no the military's all being told get ready
[02:44:24.520 --> 02:44:29.080]  for civil unrest how do you add to the equation 1.5 million instant checks
[02:44:29.080 --> 02:44:33.880]  average 2.1 guns bought that's over 3 million guns an all-time record sold
[02:44:33.880 --> 02:44:37.920]  the month of December and that's just through registered gun shops not just
[02:44:37.920 --> 02:44:42.320]  the private seller market a reseller market and and they did a survey I saw
[02:44:42.320 --> 02:44:46.960]  where the number one reason they're buying guns is fear of unrest collapse
[02:44:46.960 --> 02:44:52.000]  and not trusting the government I mean what message is that to these banksters
[02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:56.080]  that run the government that the public just bought three million guns in one
[02:44:56.080 --> 02:45:00.840]  month because they don't trust you well I I think the military is not going to
[02:45:00.840 --> 02:45:05.560]  all line up and get on board with this I just don't see everybody in the
[02:45:05.560 --> 02:45:09.280]  military saying yeah this is okay we'd like to have a military government I
[02:45:09.280 --> 02:45:13.280]  mean listen you know our military has grown up under the flag of the United
[02:45:13.280 --> 02:45:17.680]  States and the US Constitution I think the overwhelming majority of the people
[02:45:17.680 --> 02:45:22.280]  in the military believe in civil rights and believe in the US Constitution
[02:45:22.280 --> 02:45:26.200]  that's why they go to war and they die and I've long I was saying this at CNN I
[02:45:26.200 --> 02:45:30.200]  think it made people mad and I said hey you know in this whole you know I ran
[02:45:30.200 --> 02:45:37.400]  Iraq conflict excuse me Afghanistan a sporty and slip Afghanistan and Iraq
[02:45:37.400 --> 02:45:42.000]  conflict that the only people are suffering are military service people
[02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:45.880]  and their families everybody else is out drinking their lattes and having a
[02:45:45.880 --> 02:45:48.760]  good time and getting bailouts and the only people that are coming home with
[02:45:48.760 --> 02:45:52.440]  their limbs torn off and people coming home in boxes at Dover are the people in
[02:45:52.440 --> 02:45:56.440]  the military and listen I you know one thing I got to say is that if this is
[02:45:56.440 --> 02:46:02.080]  such a national security such national security importance then I think
[02:46:02.080 --> 02:46:06.360]  everybody should should sacrifice we should have a tax we should have the
[02:46:06.360 --> 02:46:09.480]  draft I think Charlie Rangel was right to say hey we should have a draft we
[02:46:09.480 --> 02:46:13.280]  shouldn't be paying contractors 150,000 incidentally you know we took all of our
[02:46:13.280 --> 02:46:17.640]  troops out of Iraq supposedly but yet I think the number is something in the
[02:46:17.640 --> 02:46:23.360]  neighborhood of 70,000 contractors left behind were are we really out of Iraq we
[02:46:23.360 --> 02:46:27.360]  just just up and left I don't I don't think so let me ask you this question
[02:46:27.360 --> 02:46:32.080]  and then I want to go to some calls okay the ruling class acts like they're not
[02:46:32.080 --> 02:46:34.840]  worried about anything anymore and as you know 20 something years ago they
[02:46:34.840 --> 02:46:37.840]  wouldn't let the troops use the pletid uranium now they just tell them don't
[02:46:37.840 --> 02:46:42.120]  worry about it it's good for you they tell the USA workers thing on that I
[02:46:42.120 --> 02:46:45.280]  did a big thing on that well that's why I brought it up to you yeah so I but but
[02:46:45.280 --> 02:46:50.480]  I mean here they are now telling TSA workers I've had TSA people tell me
[02:46:50.480 --> 02:46:54.440]  there's no radiation it's not bad for me and then I see all these top scientists
[02:46:54.440 --> 02:46:59.360]  in the news saying it's bad that the body scanners so I'm just saying the
[02:46:59.360 --> 02:47:03.800]  level of deception even for the minions that are in the system what do you
[02:47:03.800 --> 02:47:06.880]  think's going on go ahead I think they're getting at this and they're
[02:47:06.880 --> 02:47:10.880]  practice and this is a this is like a big ship and you don't take it and turn a
[02:47:10.880 --> 02:47:14.920]  big ship like a motorboat and I think the changes coming to America are going to
[02:47:14.920 --> 02:47:18.920]  be vast and of course the status quo quo wants to hang on to power and they
[02:47:18.920 --> 02:47:21.640]  don't really want to fix anything this is why let's come right back around to
[02:47:21.640 --> 02:47:26.480]  Ron Paul listen they sold liar loans okay now you people like Rush Limbaugh I've
[02:47:26.480 --> 02:47:29.120]  listened to him on the on the air the other day and I think he's an intensely
[02:47:29.120 --> 02:47:34.000]  wonderfully intelligent man and for him to come up with what he's saying is
[02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:39.800]  absolutely you know outrageous and repugnant for a man of his intelligence
[02:47:39.800 --> 02:47:44.000]  to say well the government made all these bankers you know make these loans you
[02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:48.200]  know we owe it the best frauds were a negative truth surrounded by a big load
[02:47:48.200 --> 02:47:51.800]  of you know crap and yes maybe the government did want bankers to have
[02:47:51.800 --> 02:47:55.280]  poor people to be to have more access to capital but they didn't tell them to
[02:47:55.280 --> 02:47:59.480]  have liar loans they didn't tell to take those liar loans which were fraudulent
[02:47:59.480 --> 02:48:03.520]  and package them up into securities oh and with they didn't have the paperwork
[02:48:03.520 --> 02:48:07.440]  so they lost them according to the robo signing or their manufacturing the
[02:48:07.440 --> 02:48:11.400]  promissory note you think you pay for your house in 30 years you do not you
[02:48:11.400 --> 02:48:16.160]  pay for it was the mega banks on record that lobbied government to make those
[02:48:16.160 --> 02:48:20.120]  changes and create that big auction market yeah but they didn't they couldn't
[02:48:20.120 --> 02:48:23.680]  lobby fraud and you package securities up you got to have the promissory notes
[02:48:23.680 --> 02:48:27.800]  in the security no I understand the buck stops with the banks and the people
[02:48:27.800 --> 02:48:34.160]  certifying those loans we have massive giant fraud that happened to Americans
[02:48:34.160 --> 02:48:37.640]  it was so big they changed the accounting rules in 2009 and they're still
[02:48:37.640 --> 02:48:41.800]  changed and that that the financial accounting standards board FASB said
[02:48:41.800 --> 02:48:44.840]  you can value assets real estate mortgage-backed securities at whatever
[02:48:44.840 --> 02:48:49.880]  value you think they'll be in the future now the IRS does not do that oh you want
[02:48:49.880 --> 02:48:53.760]  to pay off this loan with your house oh you want to meet a value it in the year
[02:48:53.760 --> 02:48:58.880]  2040 no what's the value today it's called mark to market accounting and if
[02:48:58.880 --> 02:49:03.280]  they did mark to market accounting see I suspect all the big banks are insolvent
[02:49:03.280 --> 02:49:08.960]  and here prove me wrong go back to mark to market accounting it value the stuff
[02:49:08.960 --> 02:49:11.680]  on on your books and I think that if it's such a big problem that they can't
[02:49:11.680 --> 02:49:14.920]  print enough money to hand out to the banks and incidentally they handed out
[02:49:14.920 --> 02:49:19.960]  what nearly 200 billion in in forgiveness and money through Fannie and
[02:49:19.960 --> 02:49:25.660]  Freddie just to one bank Bank of America last year amazing let's
[02:49:25.660 --> 02:49:29.400]  shaman a call right now it's just total insanity hyperinflation on the way
[02:49:29.400 --> 02:49:32.400]  George in Pennsylvania you're home with our guests you got any comments or
[02:49:32.400 --> 02:49:37.080]  questions three quick ones and I'll listen off air one of them was that I
[02:49:37.080 --> 02:49:40.520]  had talked with you before about having people that were voting in New Hampshire
[02:49:40.520 --> 02:49:45.240]  register with someplace that they were voting for Ron Paul so we can avoid that
[02:49:45.240 --> 02:49:48.360]  this issue at least have some people that are willing to say yes I will stand
[02:49:48.360 --> 02:49:52.160]  up in court and say that I voted for him just so we can take some of these
[02:49:52.160 --> 02:49:58.320]  fraudsters to court the other real quick one 14th amendment says if the loans
[02:49:58.320 --> 02:50:01.760]  are made in the government's name the government is not responsible for them I
[02:50:01.760 --> 02:50:05.560]  think that this is all been fraudulent I think the 14th amendment protects us I
[02:50:05.560 --> 02:50:08.880]  think we can throw all this stuff out that's right we've been signed on these
[02:50:08.880 --> 02:50:13.560]  derivatives that we don't know we correct sir so the answer is yes you're
[02:50:13.560 --> 02:50:21.200]  correct support I think it's partially our fault we haven't gotten out there
[02:50:21.200 --> 02:50:24.400]  and gotten the information out I've been handing out your information and other
[02:50:24.400 --> 02:50:28.080]  people's information as much as I can I think we need to have a political action
[02:50:28.080 --> 02:50:32.600]  committee to try to defend all these things that well that's a good point
[02:50:32.600 --> 02:50:36.880]  we're going to break Greg but start answering it now what are ideas to try
[02:50:36.880 --> 02:50:42.240]  to stop election fraud from your research well there's a good why are we
[02:50:42.240 --> 02:50:45.800]  having election fraud though if the reason why is we have two corporate
[02:50:45.800 --> 02:50:50.720]  candidates which is Romney and Obama okay period even Starch Obama supporters
[02:50:50.720 --> 02:50:55.240]  say hey he's Wall Street's man right even Michael Moore is been saying negative
[02:50:55.240 --> 02:50:58.360]  stay there let's finish on the other side to finish that point well we'll be

[02:55:13.440 --> 02:55:20.680]  Hunter of USA watchdog.com Greg what are some of your ideas to counter
[02:55:20.680 --> 02:55:26.280]  election fraud well first of all you're up against people like you and I are up
[02:55:26.280 --> 02:55:30.280]  against a big big mountain but the mountain is shrinking and our mountain is
[02:55:30.280 --> 02:55:34.240]  rising that's the that's the good news the bad news is President Obama goes on
[02:55:34.240 --> 02:55:38.280]  16 minutes at the beginning of December when front of Steve Croft and says well
[02:55:38.280 --> 02:55:42.600]  the banks did on ethical things but they didn't do anything illegal of course
[02:55:42.600 --> 02:55:46.040]  Steve Crofts who makes five or six million a year in the mainstream media
[02:55:46.040 --> 02:55:51.320]  didn't ask hey well exactly what on ethical things did they do and listen
[02:55:51.320 --> 02:55:56.360]  according to you know to William Black who's a former you know regulator
[02:55:56.360 --> 02:56:01.240]  banking regulator and a professor of economics and law says they packaged
[02:56:01.240 --> 02:56:05.800]  liar loans that they sold liar loans they packaged them in securities they
[02:56:05.800 --> 02:56:11.440]  got a tax exemption they they rated these securities many way many times
[02:56:11.440 --> 02:56:14.800]  without any paperwork and then they created the paperwork and foreclosure
[02:56:14.800 --> 02:56:19.200]  fraud and there's fraud fraud fraud fraud fraud and nothing's been done wrong
[02:56:19.200 --> 02:56:24.400]  it's a huge massive problem in the wake of the savings alone crisis they they
[02:56:24.400 --> 02:56:28.480]  basically successfully convicted a thousand financial elites they gave out
[02:56:28.480 --> 02:56:32.360]  10,000 indictments you how many people have been indicted and convicted in the
[02:56:32.360 --> 02:56:37.920]  wake of this crisis zero none not know it's a green light to take money look
[02:56:37.920 --> 02:56:42.320]  at mfglobal now and we've got cases of Bank of America and others taking houses
[02:56:42.320 --> 02:56:46.240]  not only where they don't own it or have the deed but the house has paid for in
[02:56:46.240 --> 02:56:50.600]  cash for a decade I mean and this is getting to the point of just mega
[02:56:50.600 --> 02:56:55.760]  criminality yes and it's in our you know and Eric where's Eric Holder and you
[02:56:55.760 --> 02:56:59.040]  know what I don't want to be against the Democrats because there is not a
[02:56:59.040 --> 02:57:04.080]  dimes worth a difference between the Democrats and the Republicans Obama's
[02:57:04.080 --> 02:57:07.760]  a corporate candidate and some of his far left supporters are like hey even
[02:57:07.760 --> 02:57:12.560]  Rachel Maddow came out against Obama for citing the NDAA listen she
[02:57:12.560 --> 02:57:17.240]  understands what's going on whether you like her politics or not she gets what's
[02:57:17.240 --> 02:57:21.680]  going on anybody that does journalism you know once a fair shake and be able
[02:57:21.680 --> 02:57:27.200]  to speak their mind and this NDAA is a slippery slope yes I know they say it's
[02:57:27.200 --> 02:57:31.080]  okay to but the president has an exemption in many scholars and many
[02:57:31.080 --> 02:57:34.800]  people including Ron Paul and others have said hey this is the beginning of
[02:57:34.800 --> 02:57:38.920]  what martial law here in America so we have a giant uphill battle in the
[02:57:38.920 --> 02:57:43.920]  fork and the elections fraud exists because there is not a free and
[02:57:43.920 --> 02:57:49.040]  independent media we have not a free and independent well said well said we're

[02:58:54.280 --> 02:58:58.640]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[02:58:58.640 --> 02:59:02.840]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[02:59:02.840 --> 02:59:06.880]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[02:59:06.880 --> 02:59:10.760]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[02:59:10.760 --> 02:59:15.040]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[02:59:15.040 --> 02:59:19.200]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[02:59:19.200 --> 02:59:23.520]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[02:59:23.520 --> 02:59:27.200]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[02:59:27.200 --> 02:59:31.400]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
