[00:00.000 --> 00:13.200]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:13.200 --> 00:21.420]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex
[00:21.420 --> 00:38.320]  Jones seems like five seconds ago it was Friday well here we are again and
[00:38.320 --> 00:43.840]  it's a special Friday Friday the 13th when we come back from break I will
[00:43.840 --> 00:48.120]  briefly go over the history of Friday the 13th and why it is seen not just
[00:48.120 --> 00:53.120]  here in the United States but all the world is an unlucky day but why is the
[00:53.120 --> 01:00.360]  number 13 seen as unlucky our country had 13 colonies 13 stars and stripes I
[01:00.360 --> 01:07.680]  don't know but certainly certainly it is a even if you say you're not
[01:07.680 --> 01:12.800]  superstitious almost feels unlucky though to not be a little superstitious
[01:12.800 --> 01:16.440]  and and maybe other people are superstitious at a subconscious level
[01:16.440 --> 01:22.720]  and then they do reckless things on Friday the 13th because it's almost a
[01:22.720 --> 01:26.080]  self-fulfilling prophecy at a subconscious level to expect something
[01:26.080 --> 01:30.280]  bad to happen like I don't call myself superstitious but I don't want to walk
[01:30.280 --> 01:35.480]  under a ladder maybe because a ladder might fall on you or who wants to break
[01:35.480 --> 01:39.000]  a mirror I mean that's who wants to break something I think it's unlucky
[01:39.000 --> 01:43.560]  break a mirror not because it's unlucky but because it's unlucky a lot of
[01:43.560 --> 01:47.360]  people say they're not superstitious but they are I'm already digressing off into
[01:47.360 --> 01:52.280]  superstition which really doesn't matter here ladies and gentlemen but we will
[01:52.280 --> 01:55.560]  briefly talk about the history of Friday the 13th when we come back in the next
[01:55.560 --> 02:00.960]  segment Larry Graf wall I'm turning into Donald Rumsfeld with these bizarre
[02:00.960 --> 02:05.160]  riddles I put out that don't even make sense to me Larry Graf wall who was
[02:05.160 --> 02:09.640]  inside the weatherman terrorist and one of the key witnesses that helped send
[02:09.640 --> 02:13.080]  them to the Houskow remember that clip we play where they talk about it putting
[02:13.080 --> 02:17.960]  50 million of us in reeducation camps and killing 25 mil of us he is going to
[02:17.960 --> 02:24.280]  be joining us today certainly look forward to that happening and we're
[02:24.280 --> 02:27.560]  gonna be breaking it all down the truth about the weather underground today
[02:27.560 --> 02:35.080]  much of them in and around the White House in 2012 so he is our one guest
[02:35.080 --> 02:39.560]  here on this Friday and I will endeavor to open the phones up for him and then
[02:39.560 --> 02:44.200]  have open phones really a kind of ask Alex we've been doing an ask Alex over
[02:44.200 --> 02:48.120]  at planet info wars calm the social network we've set up for info warriors
[02:48.120 --> 02:51.600]  so they can organize and get together it's in beta had a few glitches the
[02:51.600 --> 02:55.400]  first month or so but it's running like a champ right now so I would invite you
[02:55.400 --> 02:59.920]  over to set up your own profile and get to know people but the point is we
[02:59.920 --> 03:04.240]  started a ask Alex thing a couple days a week we play on the nightly news the
[03:04.240 --> 03:08.800]  people really like so I thought why not have asked Alex where I specifically say
[03:08.800 --> 03:13.720]  your questions right now so you have a quick question I hang up on you and
[03:13.720 --> 03:20.680]  then I try to be not long-winded maybe that can break the cycle of I'll be
[03:20.680 --> 03:25.000]  doing overall better lately taking calls but again nobody's telling me take
[03:25.000 --> 03:29.440]  more calls I like to take calls I like the different directions wildcard it
[03:29.440 --> 03:32.720]  takes us in but then I tend to get stuck on all the news and never get to it
[03:32.720 --> 03:40.640]  on speaking of news it is going to be a absolutely jam-packed transmission today
[03:40.640 --> 03:45.920]  hey you've heard of drones in the sky drones on the ground how about drones
[03:45.920 --> 03:50.600]  on top of the water and under the sea I told you the entire military is going
[03:50.600 --> 03:55.080]  to robots this is really robots because they've already got autonomous drones
[03:55.080 --> 04:01.160]  in the sea in space in the air on the ground all the stuff you've seen 20 to
[04:01.160 --> 04:06.240]  30 years old some of it over it's all ancient my grandfather in the late
[04:06.240 --> 04:11.280]  60s went out even got the patent and stuff with some other inventors it was
[04:11.280 --> 04:17.040]  kind of an eccentric type my mom's dad and created a anti-riot robot it was
[04:17.040 --> 04:22.000]  just remote control and basically had these big long arms on it that were had
[04:22.000 --> 04:27.240]  voltage coming out of them and the Pentagon bought it but never mass
[04:27.240 --> 04:30.800]  manufactured at least that's what my grandfather was told but it paid for the
[04:30.800 --> 04:34.520]  investment the research this is what they've been obsessed with forever is
[04:34.520 --> 04:41.400]  getting rid of humans in the equation so the globalist can technocratically give
[04:41.400 --> 04:45.040]  orders so we're going to talk about that and that's just the tip of the iceberg
[04:45.040 --> 04:51.080]  Mitt Romney wants Condi and hey she likes abortion so she'll probably be in
[04:51.080 --> 04:55.080]  there nothing more conservative than abortion carbon taxes and the
[04:55.080 --> 04:58.240]  government health care I'm a liberal because I'm against it we'll be right

[08:24.120 --> 08:38.240]  it is friday the 13th 2012 we're going to be here for the next three hours thank
[08:38.240 --> 08:43.480]  you so much for joining us we have a gas coming up in the next hour who was
[08:43.480 --> 08:49.840]  inside the weather underground and help put those folks in prison they're now
[08:49.840 --> 08:56.560]  basically got their red diaper doper baby in the White House hair hair Obama
[08:56.560 --> 09:00.720]  and we're seeing all the tyranny that comes with that again mega banks funding
[09:00.720 --> 09:05.880]  communist that's the way it always works to take over wreck a country then the
[09:05.880 --> 09:09.480]  bankers come in later through their oligarchs and take control and call it
[09:09.480 --> 09:13.920]  free market saw a big study out today it's in my stacked all over the world
[09:13.920 --> 09:19.640]  people are down on capitalism because the monopoly crony anti-free market
[09:19.640 --> 09:24.120]  media blames what's happening on free market and capitalism not on what it
[09:24.120 --> 09:31.440]  really is organized crime government corporate fascism is is is a closer more
[09:31.440 --> 09:38.000]  accurate term for what it is a global kleptocratic thieving group that gets
[09:38.000 --> 09:42.440]  control of governments and exempts themselves from the avalanches of laws
[09:42.440 --> 09:49.360]  they pile on us red tape and bureaucracy now it is Friday the 13th and my son
[09:49.360 --> 09:53.760]  asked me this morning why is Friday the 13th seen as unlucky so I thought I
[09:53.760 --> 09:59.080]  would dig up the history of that for my son who's listening and obviously any
[09:59.080 --> 10:02.440]  new listeners who don't know why Friday the 13th is seen as unlucky the Knights
[10:02.440 --> 10:08.080]  Templar curse and Friday the 13th and you can just type in the origins of Friday
[10:08.080 --> 10:11.560]  the 13th it's out there the Knights Templar have always been surrounded by
[10:11.560 --> 10:16.000]  mystery and the only facts that we can gather about them or that they were
[10:16.000 --> 10:19.320]  Christian Knights who escorted pilgrims to the Holy Land and fought in the
[10:19.320 --> 10:24.520]  Crusades got and became fabulously wealthy it has been believed the day the
[10:24.520 --> 10:28.920]  Pope and the Kings and France and Spain both ordered them to be arrested on
[10:28.920 --> 10:34.960]  October 13th 1307 a Friday Friday the 13th after their arrest they were all
[10:34.960 --> 10:38.240]  brutally tortured get to find out where all the treasure was and forced to
[10:38.240 --> 10:42.200]  confess to such sins as spitting on the cross because everybody wants to do that
[10:42.200 --> 10:48.040]  in their extra time worshipping false gods worshipping the devil homosexuality
[10:48.040 --> 10:52.080]  and sodomy considering they were being tortured and they most likely just
[10:52.080 --> 10:57.240]  stated anything in order to get out of the torture well no no no no no Jack
[10:57.240 --> 11:00.880]  Bauer tortures people to keep them safe I mean tortures what the good guys do
[11:00.880 --> 11:08.480]  being sarcastic here but yes that's the main reason 13 as seen as unlucky and a
[11:08.480 --> 11:14.040]  lot of Asian cultures predating this that they thought it was unlucky 8 is
[11:14.040 --> 11:22.520]  seen as lucky multiple 8's really lucky 7 is seen as lucky in the West show
[11:22.520 --> 11:27.560]  whatever reason 13 seen as unlucky but the United States 13 colonies 13 stars
[11:27.560 --> 11:32.680]  and stripes 13 stars it's whatever you make of it but perhaps people expect
[11:32.680 --> 11:37.880]  bad things to happen on Friday the 13th so they do kind of you walk into a
[11:37.880 --> 11:40.600]  restaurant you're rude to everybody have a bad attitude people aren't gonna like
[11:40.600 --> 11:44.680]  you I found that if you're in a good mood happy you generally you're gonna get
[11:44.680 --> 11:50.560]  that back I don't know I mean I'll never forget walking into convenience stores
[11:50.560 --> 11:53.360]  and stuff you don't get in gas ask him about that I could have a candy bar or
[11:53.360 --> 11:57.560]  whatever and seeing people smile at him and and and everything and I said dad
[11:57.560 --> 12:01.120]  people frown at me and stuff I was going to like a stage like 10 or 11 of frowning
[12:01.120 --> 12:05.680]  and he said well that's that's because you're frowning I'm smiling and I mean
[12:05.680 --> 12:11.160]  it's just a simple thing but so many of us so many of us forget that but
[12:11.160 --> 12:14.360]  politicians walk around with those fake shark smiles all the time like they're a
[12:14.360 --> 12:21.840]  clown or something but with my dad he was actually a happy guy okay enough on
[12:21.840 --> 12:27.160]  that subject let us now plunge directly into the headlines you know what I'm
[12:27.160 --> 12:30.280]  gonna do it today I'm just gonna read the headlines I've never succeeded but
[12:30.280 --> 12:34.360]  today will be the day where I just read headlines and then I'm gonna go back into

[12:51.040 --> 12:56.720]  about this years ago now it's admitted DHS emergency power extended every week
[12:56.720 --> 13:01.200]  it's a new extension including control of private telecom systems they've been
[13:01.200 --> 13:04.960]  in control since the telecommunications act but now it's down to ISPs with a
[13:04.960 --> 13:13.360]  hundred or more customers wow talk about takeover just spy grids takeover grids
[13:13.360 --> 13:18.160]  Walmart tele screens oh I'm not just reading the headlines am I trying to

[13:31.640 --> 13:35.360]  could not wait to send somebody to prison because again they like to judge
[13:35.360 --> 13:39.600]  smiling at them that's that's that's that's satisfaction even if they're
[13:39.600 --> 13:43.640]  stopping your baby's brains out in the future as long as as long as the as long

[13:51.200 --> 13:54.840]  seen that film footage in Russia and Germany where people would politely nod
[13:54.840 --> 13:58.520]  and oh you know just take a little nod from the soldier before they because
[13:58.520 --> 14:03.120]  that's what really mattered was like you know having your hat in your hand and
[14:03.120 --> 14:06.880]  just bowing to the officer I mean that's what it's all about and and they
[14:06.880 --> 14:13.280]  said the court ruled we will grab your genitals you will not touch ours oh I'm

[14:52.840 --> 14:56.440]  for bravery for drone pilots who kill people remotely far from well of course
[14:56.440 --> 15:00.880]  that's heroic nothing more heroic but again they're not even to have humans
[15:00.880 --> 15:05.480]  flying them soon they've already got them out autonomous kill drones and they
[15:05.480 --> 15:08.720]  admit the drones are learning from the humans they have computers learning what
[15:08.720 --> 15:11.840]  humans do and then you just turn the drones loose you type type it in
[15:11.840 --> 15:15.800]  autonomous drones now in the skies see it's all about a future without humans
[15:15.800 --> 15:18.800]  that's what that's what the globalists call it the future doesn't need us why
[15:18.800 --> 15:22.160]  the future doesn't need us just search those terms and learn that's why you've
[15:22.160 --> 15:27.880]  all been implanted with nanotech cancer viruses they just call them cancer
[15:27.880 --> 15:31.880]  viruses but they've been engineered they're nanotech all these new vaccines

[16:50.160 --> 16:56.320]  news I've got the Sandusky news let's do the oh yeah that little kingdom of
[16:56.320 --> 17:01.880]  pedophiles they are boy the FBI didn't want to handle this because that's one
[17:01.880 --> 17:06.320]  of their little pedophile command bases there at Penn State they're in a pedophile
[17:06.320 --> 17:11.920]  Valley what are they gonna do oh all the famous people going in there you know
[17:11.920 --> 17:16.920]  Sandusky so confident he was raping kids in the shower at high noon and it's all
[17:16.920 --> 17:21.600]  confirmed of course they all knew of course folks they didn't just know that
[17:21.600 --> 17:25.080]  can look at those Penn State officials and tell you their pedophiles I mean my
[17:25.080 --> 17:29.160]  god just look at Sandusky like a demonic ferret needs to be put into a meat
[17:29.160 --> 17:34.120]  grinder head first I mean that's what a pedophile looks like right there a buck
[17:34.120 --> 17:39.520]  toothed demonic rat of some type begging to be fed into a meat grinder head
[17:39.520 --> 17:44.240]  first and that's where he's going oh yeah check out the ear hair I mean that
[17:44.240 --> 17:48.200]  that's like a feeler in the dark so he can like like a rat you know scurry
[17:48.200 --> 17:53.280]  around when he's in hell all right anyways excuse me get Sandusky off the
[17:53.280 --> 17:56.400]  screen about to throw up you know what since we brought that up I'll just get
[17:56.400 --> 18:01.160]  to it right now again every demonic culture that's been taken over by these
[18:01.160 --> 18:06.860]  people engages in human sacrifice and they always demand the kids show if they
[18:06.860 --> 18:11.160]  can't get away with killing kids it's not just about raping them they want to
[18:11.160 --> 18:15.840]  psychically hurt them as bad as they can and ruin them so it's a it's a it's a
[18:15.840 --> 18:20.800]  psychic sacrifice every culture research the anthropology and the
[18:20.800 --> 18:27.280]  archaeology every culture has these people take over black white Asian you
[18:27.280 --> 18:32.880]  name it every culture develops guilds that that demand they dropped by your
[18:32.880 --> 18:35.760]  house or you bring your child to them most people are so brainwashed they
[18:35.760 --> 18:38.960]  would be proud to have their two-year-old son or daughter have their heart
[18:38.960 --> 18:42.120]  cut out while high priest gobble their intestines in front of everyone and
[18:42.120 --> 18:45.480]  splatter their guts all over the ground and read the tea leaves out of their
[18:45.480 --> 18:49.920]  intestines I mean this is this is this is what it's all about this is what the
[18:49.920 --> 18:53.560]  Illuminati are all about throughout history show instead because they can't
[18:53.560 --> 18:57.560]  just kill them outright they want to soft kill them with vaccines GMOs yeah
[18:57.560 --> 19:03.840]  that's another way they still get their sacrifice but again these entities that
[19:03.840 --> 19:07.480]  are in them whatever you want to call it the malfunction if you just want to
[19:07.480 --> 19:12.240]  look at it from a biological perspective of these cancerous humans is that they
[19:12.240 --> 19:15.680]  demand children normally the firstborn because for whatever reason that was
[19:15.680 --> 19:19.480]  seen as the most valuable those were going to be leaders in the future almost
[19:19.480 --> 19:22.440]  all the astronauts almost all your top scientists are firstborn for whatever
[19:22.440 --> 19:26.560]  reason they're around adults they grow up as adults they grow up with more
[19:26.560 --> 19:30.120]  advanced intelligence IQ not knocking folks that aren't firstborn it's just a
[19:30.120 --> 19:34.800]  fact you know there are some anomalies that are different they want to take
[19:34.800 --> 19:39.240]  your firstborn and take or torture them they like to well most cultures would
[19:39.240 --> 19:43.600]  like to throw small children on like a big open metal oven the flapping around
[19:43.600 --> 19:48.320]  and screaming what was the was the foot big anyways the point is and these
[19:48.320 --> 19:52.760]  devil pits are everywhere and most of your big universities most your big now
[19:52.760 --> 19:57.000]  international law enforcement national law enforcement are armies of child
[19:57.000 --> 20:02.200]  killing child raping demonic slugs well they're right back let me ask you a

[24:53.280 --> 24:56.680]  sometimes I get you know a whole bunch of phone calls on the line and don't get
[24:56.680 --> 25:00.000]  to everybody but we run out of time here and try to give callers a lot of time
[25:00.000 --> 25:07.680]  and then I I go on for a long time and you know the drill but 800-259-9231 is
[25:07.680 --> 25:12.480]  the toll-free number to join us getting back to Sandusky I'm not joking about
[25:12.480 --> 25:19.720]  burning children in fiery pits every major culture get it the druids all over
[25:19.720 --> 25:29.760]  northern and western Europe into all beyond they engaged in it everywhere all
[25:29.760 --> 25:35.000]  over the Middle East all over Central Asia all over the Far East every culture
[25:35.000 --> 25:41.040]  they dig into they would have big idols with basically either a fire in front of
[25:41.040 --> 25:45.800]  them or a big sheet of metal heated up if you're a new listener I wasn't joking
[25:45.800 --> 25:50.120]  earlier on talked about that look it up they would throw children onto it I guess
[25:50.120 --> 25:54.920]  just for added screaming and pain and and power trips you know for you or an
[25:54.920 --> 25:58.840]  eye that would be like ripping our guts out we would rather die than see
[25:58.840 --> 26:04.840]  something like that I mean I almost go to my knees and just reverent love of God
[26:04.840 --> 26:10.280]  to see a beautiful sunset or sunrise or an innocent child catch a little perch
[26:10.280 --> 26:15.400]  fish and smile and have creativity and innocence in their eyes and I want to
[26:15.400 --> 26:19.720]  kill people that want to hurt children my instinct is you know they like to hurt
[26:19.720 --> 26:24.520]  children well I like to you know basically bash the brains out of people
[26:24.520 --> 26:28.720]  that want to hurt children and I'm not a violent person but I have extreme
[26:28.720 --> 26:33.240]  feelings of violence towards people like that I had a serious desire to gouge
[26:33.240 --> 26:39.000]  their eyes out to tear their heads off I get so mad that I guarantee you I could
[26:39.000 --> 26:43.040]  physically tear somebody's head off I guarantee I could break their break their
[26:43.040 --> 26:47.040]  neck in about one second and if you don't have that feeling towards these
[26:47.040 --> 26:51.280]  perverts and towards these criminals then you've got something wrong with you
[26:51.280 --> 26:58.760]  okay it's not macho or tough that I have a serious feelings of violence towards
[26:58.760 --> 27:02.920]  people that hurt children and I don't mean disciplining your child when I try
[27:02.920 --> 27:06.600]  to stick your finger in a light socket that that is good to do I'm talking to
[27:06.600 --> 27:11.040]  people who want to hurt children and who want to abuse them and dominate them
[27:11.040 --> 27:15.400]  and lock them up like the cases in France and other areas of Europe where
[27:15.400 --> 27:19.520]  they caught pedophiles with little kids in dungeons starving them to death and
[27:19.520 --> 27:23.160]  these elitists would come and do horrible things to them this is going on
[27:23.160 --> 27:27.360]  and you look at it could I've seen the comments on the website and seen emails
[27:27.360 --> 27:30.840]  coming in going wise and Alex talking about Sandusky since he got convicted
[27:30.840 --> 27:34.680]  and since this all came out and hey you were you were right and hey you know it
[27:34.680 --> 27:38.560]  goes to the top of course it went to the top and I haven't covered it a lot
[27:38.560 --> 27:44.280]  because it gets me upset okay it gets me very very upset and then I'm likely to
[27:44.280 --> 27:49.840]  blow up at people around me so I tend to try to just be dark and sarcastic but
[27:49.840 --> 27:54.760]  it's not because I think it's funny it's because it makes me want to attack
[27:54.760 --> 28:00.080]  people okay I mean it it's just that simple I mean I cannot look at
[28:00.080 --> 28:07.760]  Sandusky without going into a controlled rage and of course it's now come out that
[28:07.760 --> 28:12.440]  the entire hierarchy was knowingly covering things up which makes them
[28:12.440 --> 28:15.760]  accessory to the crimes and all of them need to be arrested everybody's like oh
[28:15.760 --> 28:20.080]  the coach is good don't say he knows and all this you know six months ago when
[28:20.080 --> 28:23.600]  all this started I got a lot of heat for saying of course they knew and of course
[28:23.600 --> 28:27.560]  it goes higher than that you look at that charity and the whole way it's set up
[28:27.560 --> 28:31.680]  how it's designed for disadvantaged kids that have already had problems that
[28:31.680 --> 28:35.680]  way nobody will believe them when they get abused the whole way it's set up
[28:35.680 --> 28:41.520]  it's so dark ladies and gentlemen I've talked to Hollywood people I know
[28:41.520 --> 28:45.520]  there's some books coming out on it soon about what goes on in Hollywood and
[28:45.520 --> 28:49.240]  again it's not even the actors and people they're just the minions but the
[28:49.240 --> 28:57.320]  producers and the higher ups it's just a kingdom of evil and the Disney stars and
[28:57.320 --> 29:02.160]  all that I remember 15 years ago here and they were MK ultra and part of these
[29:02.160 --> 29:05.600]  projects and then to later find out that from people in Hollywood that they
[29:05.600 --> 29:09.800]  really are that there really is mind control programs and then it really is
[29:09.800 --> 29:14.600]  Operation Monarch and then Katy Perry comes out with her new video and it's
[29:14.600 --> 29:20.320]  Operation Monarch programming I mean it's just we were living in a total crazy
[29:20.320 --> 29:24.320]  land is what I'm telling you but if you look at history it's what happens over
[29:24.320 --> 29:31.040]  and over again so I look at Sandusky and all this stuff I mean I just I need to
[29:31.040 --> 29:34.120]  get off this subject because it really I've got you to have a lot of energy

[33:02.440 --> 33:18.320]  you are listening to an infowars.com front-line report if you are receiving
[33:18.320 --> 33:23.080]  this transmission you are the resistance
[33:24.640 --> 33:30.080]  we have to decide as a civilization that we don't want to be deindustrialized and
[33:30.080 --> 33:36.840]  have all of our functions replaced by autonomous pre-programmed robots
[33:36.840 --> 33:41.840]  controlled by the globalist and in all their white papers that's all they've
[33:41.840 --> 33:45.640]  talked about for 50 years how they were going to get to this point that's how I
[33:45.640 --> 33:52.560]  know every new step of their program the entire underwater fleet the entire
[33:52.560 --> 33:58.040]  surface fleet the entire aircraft fleet the entire ground force fleet will be
[33:58.040 --> 34:06.360]  robot they've got different numbers of 2020 2025 by 2015 you know the vast
[34:06.360 --> 34:12.160]  majority of the Air Force and armies aircraft will be autonomous not just
[34:12.160 --> 34:16.760]  not just drone with some guy that was playing video games that were really a
[34:16.760 --> 34:20.360]  primer you know they have movies like The Last Starfighter it's a good kids
[34:20.360 --> 34:26.120]  movie I remember seeing it back when I was a kid and I bought it and my son and
[34:26.120 --> 34:30.920]  I watched it I think it's a little too old for my oldest daughter but we watched
[34:30.920 --> 34:34.640]  The Last Starfighter last year and the kid goes and plays the video game in his
[34:34.640 --> 34:39.240]  trailer park and when you no one's ever won the game and when he wins the game
[34:39.240 --> 34:43.480]  a spaceship lands with a humanoid and says all right you're being recruited to
[34:43.480 --> 34:48.560]  join you know this fleet because of the skills you have and then he's taken off
[34:48.560 --> 34:51.920]  world to go be The Last Starfighter because before they get back to the base
[34:51.920 --> 35:00.200]  that gets blown up the point is is that that isn't life imitating art today that
[35:00.200 --> 35:06.640]  that's actually how these connect and video games work is that most of the
[35:06.640 --> 35:11.720]  people now joining the Air Force and other systems are video game heads and
[35:11.720 --> 35:15.800]  we're actually playing on similar simulators for the decade and are now
[35:15.800 --> 35:22.240]  flying real drones real reapers and bombing people and getting medals for
[35:22.240 --> 35:29.000]  because the Pentagon developed video games before Pong and before all the
[35:29.000 --> 35:34.960]  first games in the 70s they developed them for instinctive shooting and to
[35:34.960 --> 35:39.680]  train people to pull triggers just as pop-up targets do so that people wouldn't
[35:39.680 --> 35:43.640]  hesitate when they were confronted with another human at close range it would
[35:43.640 --> 35:51.800]  kill them where they've got where troops kill people at at rates of 95 96 97%
[35:51.800 --> 35:57.000]  up close and don't think a thing about it blow up a car full of men women
[35:57.000 --> 35:59.880]  children won't even feel bad about it when the kids crawl along with their
[35:59.880 --> 36:04.520]  guts coming out you know blown in half because they've simulated the killing so
[36:04.520 --> 36:08.840]  many times with the video games that now it doesn't matter this was all
[36:08.840 --> 36:13.760]  admittedly scientifically done to dehumanize us so that now as we're
[36:13.760 --> 36:17.480]  killed and as this is all turned against us people can't differentiate
[36:17.480 --> 36:21.080]  because they've seen thousands of simulated murders on TV hundreds of
[36:21.080 --> 36:24.840]  thousands on video games where it's always zombies and monsters but the
[36:24.840 --> 36:31.000]  humanoid shape to where now humans see themselves as garbage and now people are
[36:31.000 --> 36:35.640]  going crazy thinking they're zombies and and and and trying to eat people's
[36:35.640 --> 36:42.000]  faces off showing the power of television to condition people
[36:42.960 --> 36:48.080]  I mean I saw studies about in the 50s and 60s if they police notice very
[36:48.080 --> 36:53.480]  quickly that if they had a big top TV show come out and have somebody jump
[36:53.480 --> 36:58.640]  off the Empire State's building or another big building on the TV show that
[36:58.640 --> 37:03.960]  suddenly scores of people would show up that day or that night and would go and
[37:03.960 --> 37:06.800]  try to jump off the Empire State's building just because they saw it on
[37:06.800 --> 37:10.200]  television or if it was on the news that somebody did jump off a building
[37:10.200 --> 37:13.160]  suddenly they'd have the station police there because people were there to jump
[37:13.160 --> 37:17.640]  off the building this is the suggestibility of the population and
[37:17.640 --> 37:21.800]  we've gotten more and more suggestible just like when we're in a hypnotic state
[37:21.800 --> 37:27.600]  and you can have a magician you'll get you to trick your mind into doing what
[37:27.600 --> 37:33.000]  they say and believing a potato is an apple or walking off the stage and
[37:33.000 --> 37:37.840]  falling on a mattress and the people really are doing it because they're
[37:37.840 --> 37:43.360]  undermined control and that's what the television this whole culture is that's
[37:43.360 --> 37:47.040]  why people can't wake up as the government goes yeah we're spying on you
[37:47.040 --> 37:50.400]  yeah we're torturing killing people yeah we'll kill you yeah we're putting
[37:50.400 --> 37:54.680]  cancer viruses in your shots hey you know what we did lie that h1n1 does
[37:54.680 --> 38:00.600]  kill you that vaccine does eat your brain don't worry we're gonna give you a
[38:00.600 --> 38:04.280]  shot soon we're even those of you that resist us and are resistant to all the
[38:04.280 --> 38:07.800]  programming and chemicals it's not gonna matter the virus is gonna go in and
[38:07.800 --> 38:12.800]  attack your brain and destroy your key centers of resistance you're gonna not
[38:12.800 --> 38:17.040]  be upset anymore just like a body snatcher movie just go to sleep when you
[38:17.040 --> 38:20.840]  wake up it'll all be alright or just take this shot there's not gonna be
[38:20.840 --> 38:25.960]  anymore anymore getting upset anymore you're upset about all the stuff
[38:25.960 --> 38:31.840]  happening you're not gonna be upset anymore join us join us join us this is
[38:31.840 --> 38:38.760]  how heavy reality is we're going to see things that blow your mind that blow my
[38:38.760 --> 38:45.280]  mind into the world it in 2012 folks that's just getting you conditioned see
[38:45.280 --> 38:48.520]  they they have the Christians all taught to lay down that it's the end of
[38:48.520 --> 38:54.800]  the world not a teaching that was in the Bible you know a pre-tribulation until
[38:54.800 --> 38:58.840]  the last 170 years or so so everybody goes oh praise God they want us to take
[38:58.840 --> 39:03.320]  chips that means the end of the world's here I'll be teleported out oh yeah like
[39:03.320 --> 39:06.560]  all the Christians in the Bible that were teleported out no they had to face
[39:06.560 --> 39:11.000]  it before God delivered them and only sometimes and that was part of God's
[39:11.000 --> 39:16.320]  plan and you know in your gut you're not gonna escape any of this all of you
[39:16.320 --> 39:20.280]  cowards out there who think you're gonna escape the New World Order you're not
[39:20.280 --> 39:29.760]  gonna escape jack squat you understand that you're gonna face reality that's
[39:29.760 --> 39:34.160]  history that's common sense that's God's universal law and you better get used
[39:34.160 --> 39:38.520]  to it and better get ready for it of course you'll line up and take the shot
[39:38.520 --> 39:46.080]  won't you because you are gonna want your free will taken the mark is a
[39:46.080 --> 39:51.560]  genetic engineering weapon program where you willingly are told you're
[39:51.560 --> 39:57.160]  giving up your free will and join the matrix with a viral nanotech injection
[39:57.160 --> 40:01.520]  I've known this for a long time but it's totally clear now that's what it is but
[40:01.520 --> 40:06.560]  they're they're not the soft kill they try to do without you knowing but there's
[40:06.560 --> 40:09.720]  some universal metaphysical law that when they really get ready to take your
[40:09.720 --> 40:13.320]  free will you're gonna have to give it up and decide to be a biological Android
[40:13.320 --> 40:17.480]  and that's the real mark of the beast and that's why you can't repent and God
[40:17.480 --> 40:22.960]  can't take you back because it literally is gonna wipe your brain now the spirit
[40:22.960 --> 40:29.920]  will still be there but you're damned you're cut off I didn't mean to start
[40:29.920 --> 40:34.400]  preaching I said I'd go to your calls and got a lot of other news here but the
[40:34.400 --> 40:40.520]  Sandusky thing in closing shows you how a whole institution with hundreds of
[40:40.520 --> 40:46.840]  people at the top could know that there was a whole pedophile charity going at
[40:46.840 --> 40:50.600]  one of the most prestigious universities in the country shurning out all the big
[40:50.600 --> 40:54.360]  pharma heads you notice how all the Homeland Security heads and big pharma
[40:54.360 --> 41:00.440]  heads and FBI directors it's all coming out of this school coming out of
[41:00.440 --> 41:03.720]  Harvard coming out of Yale coming out of the University of Texas coming out of
[41:03.720 --> 41:08.280]  Berkeley wherever you've got the cream coming out you better believe it in the
[41:08.280 --> 41:12.320]  cream it's the puss of the puss the demon of the demon the rotten of the
[41:12.320 --> 41:16.160]  rotten and then all these other people who knew it was going on and weren't
[41:16.160 --> 41:20.000]  into hurting kids but they still became accomplices because they well they
[41:20.000 --> 41:23.720]  couldn't bring down the system and the news is like oh too bad for Penn State
[41:23.720 --> 41:28.080]  it's really hurting them and hurting enrollment oh too bad it's not about all
[41:28.080 --> 41:33.680]  the kids it's not about people getting threatened and mysterious deaths of
[41:33.680 --> 41:39.800]  investigators oh yeah people were killed over this it's not about that no it's
[41:39.800 --> 41:44.080]  about the stinking University and people that are alumni now that feel
[41:44.080 --> 41:50.280]  embarrassed that they're alumni of Penn State you see it's that spirit that
[41:50.280 --> 41:53.800]  allows this type of stuff to go on I mean if I was an assistant football coach
[41:53.800 --> 41:57.560]  and I walked into the showers and somebody had a little kid been over let
[41:57.560 --> 42:00.800]  me tell you something the police aren't going to get called it's not because I'm
[42:00.800 --> 42:05.120]  macho or tough I am gonna stomp I probably would have killed Jerry
[42:05.120 --> 42:08.840]  Sandusky and folks I'm not bragging but I mean you know I'm just a regular man
[42:08.840 --> 42:12.520]  you I see something like that I'm gonna do something that didn't talk folks I've
[42:12.520 --> 42:16.040]  put probably 20 people in the hospital people that started fights with me you
[42:16.040 --> 42:19.880]  start a fight with me you're gonna get a fight right back 110 percent and that
[42:19.880 --> 42:24.080]  doesn't mean people didn't start fights with me that what my butt doesn't mean
[42:24.080 --> 42:27.560]  I hadn't had broken legs and concussions and you know loose teeth and
[42:27.560 --> 42:31.000]  lips split and black eyes I'm not here saying I'm the baddest guy on the block
[42:31.000 --> 42:35.000]  I'll tell you right now there are people out there that are animals that'll have
[42:35.000 --> 42:38.080]  your head bouncing off the concrete so fast you don't know how they're doing
[42:38.080 --> 42:42.440]  it they can do back flips down the street but I'll tell you right now if I
[42:42.440 --> 42:45.480]  saw somebody doing something like that I wouldn't be able to control myself I'd
[42:45.480 --> 42:49.120]  come in there and he'd turn around I'd knock his nose right up into his brain
[42:49.120 --> 42:53.320]  I'd slam him right in the eye I'd grab him and start just slamming his head in
[42:53.320 --> 42:57.600]  there and you know what I went to jail that's just the way it is it's a crime
[42:57.600 --> 43:01.920]  of passion that's the top of attitude you have to have for these scum instead
[43:01.920 --> 43:04.320]  the assistant coach comes in and goes and tells people they're like you better
[43:04.320 --> 43:10.560]  shut up about this because they're a bunch of predators ladies and gentlemen
[43:10.560 --> 43:17.200]  that's what they are I'm gonna shut up right there I just see I don't want to
[43:17.200 --> 43:20.920]  sit here and try to sound like Mr. Tough Guy I start beating my chest like a
[43:20.920 --> 43:25.920]  gorilla as soon as I start thinking about the scum out there because I have
[43:25.920 --> 43:32.160]  children and they make me so angry and an instinctive level all I think is kill
[43:32.160 --> 43:39.160]  kill kill kill kill you notice the system always tells those of us that aren't
[43:39.160 --> 43:43.000]  sickos that we need to sit down shut up and be passive so they can run around
[43:43.000 --> 43:46.960]  having their way with us I'm tired of it we've gotten to this point because we've
[43:46.960 --> 43:54.560]  let evil run wild and tell us to sit down and shut up I've got all this other
[43:54.560 --> 43:59.480]  news on Condi rise the abortionist the abortion supporter at the top of the
[43:59.480 --> 44:03.640]  list for Mitt Romney I've got all the clips of him saying how much he loves
[44:03.640 --> 44:07.120]  abortion I mean it's just it's such a bit and then and then Obama is saying
[44:07.120 --> 44:10.920]  Romney Obama has his surrogate saying Obama me
[44:10.920 --> 44:18.200]  Obama I said a four-year slip Obama is saying that Romney his his his vice
[44:18.200 --> 44:21.200]  president basically if something happens with Obama then there's the backup
[44:21.200 --> 44:25.640]  and literally oh Mitt Romney is like his real vice president that's how the
[44:25.640 --> 44:29.640]  new world works he's just the guy in waiting right there I had that epiphany
[44:29.640 --> 44:33.480]  last night that Mitt Romney is the real vice president because they have to have
[44:33.480 --> 44:36.120]  two guys in an election in case something happens with Obama or some
[44:36.120 --> 44:39.560]  scandal they can't control and Mitt Romney I'll guarantee you in their
[44:39.560 --> 44:43.000]  councils then the and you know they're meeting privately he is the vice
[44:43.000 --> 44:46.320]  president Mitt Romney is the vice president during the election right now
[44:46.320 --> 44:55.200]  so vice president Romney global elect globalist elected he's I went hey hey
[44:55.200 --> 44:58.560]  this is over the top saying I'm a criminal saying I wasn't involved in
[44:58.560 --> 45:03.280]  main decisions once I left to run the Olympics in Salt Lake City in 99 you
[45:03.280 --> 45:06.120]  know that's not right to say I'm a criminal in a felon that I made these
[45:06.120 --> 45:12.120]  decisions and I lied about it to the SEC and others and he's like hey be nice
[45:12.120 --> 45:15.840]  because he won't even talk about fast and furious he won't go after Obama on
[45:15.840 --> 45:21.560]  anything and so he's saying hey you tell your surrogates get off the vice
[45:21.560 --> 45:27.480]  president I'm the vice president Obama you don't talk about about your vice
[45:27.480 --> 45:33.240]  president Obama me and then Condi Rice it's so sick I mean it this is a woman
[45:33.240 --> 45:36.360]  who Mayor Willie Brown called her and said don't get on a plane to New York
[45:36.360 --> 45:43.920]  tomorrow morning that's in the that's in the San Francisco Chronicle she called
[45:43.920 --> 45:48.920]  him and said don't fly excuse me let's just go to your calls I'm gonna shut up
[45:48.920 --> 45:54.120]  now Thomas and Mass you're on the air welcome yeah I'm gonna try and be quick
[45:54.120 --> 45:57.000]  because I know you're trying to rifle through them what happens when they
[45:57.000 --> 46:01.960]  collapse when the collapse happens either hyperinflationary or deflationary
[46:01.960 --> 46:06.160]  depression what happens to those of us who have outstanding mortgages or
[46:06.160 --> 46:11.000]  loans do you pay it off in inflated dollars what if you can't pay it off and
[46:11.000 --> 46:14.320]  what implications does that have for those of us who are preparing to bug in
[46:14.320 --> 46:20.720]  and I'll take my answer up the air Wow that's an incredibly important question
[46:21.400 --> 46:26.160]  crystallize that I mean you're saying you're saying what happens when the
[46:26.160 --> 46:32.960]  collapse takes place I mean what do you he's gone I mean what happens to people
[46:32.960 --> 46:37.320]  that decide to stay in their houses the globalist won't go ahead with the total
[46:37.320 --> 46:42.640]  collapse unless they think we'll put up with it and then they will that they
[46:42.640 --> 46:46.920]  could stage race riots they could stage a newt going off and they've got a lot of
[46:46.920 --> 46:51.880]  nasty cards in their hand and you ask the question we've had all these experts
[46:51.880 --> 46:59.120]  on like James Wesley Rawls and so many others
[47:01.040 --> 47:04.280]  you know what happens to you what happens when the collapse takes place
[47:04.280 --> 47:08.280]  it's happening slowly as cities go bankrupt all over the country as police
[47:08.280 --> 47:11.880]  get caught one good thing is there's so many guns in the country that's going to
[47:11.880 --> 47:16.120]  keep criminals from going too wild you'll just see lots of reports of
[47:16.120 --> 47:19.720]  criminals getting shot breaking in houses that's now increasing right now
[47:19.720 --> 47:24.000]  I think because we've been here and others have been out there warning people
[47:24.000 --> 47:28.920]  ahead of time that that's a whole area of discussion I was just thinking this
[47:28.920 --> 47:32.960]  morning we need to get more guest on to focus for whole shows just on what a
[47:32.960 --> 47:35.720]  collapse will look like the different types of collapses and how to deal with
[47:35.720 --> 47:40.120]  it it's it's too big a question to answer in a short short space Ken in
[47:40.120 --> 47:46.680]  Michigan Ken you're on the air let's say Alex thanks for doing a great job Alex
[47:46.680 --> 47:51.840]  my question is to you I'm a 68 year old male I come out of the MK ultra program
[47:51.840 --> 47:56.600]  and there's targeted individuals that they're using microwaves on us all over
[47:56.600 --> 48:02.400]  the United States thousands of us what do you think of that well you know there's
[48:02.400 --> 48:06.320]  people that are mentally ill from the heavy metals and things most schizophrenia
[48:06.320 --> 48:12.640]  out there they found a major studies is chemically based or you've got not you
[48:12.640 --> 48:16.560]  but people that have schizophrenia have Lyme's disease and which is really just
[48:16.560 --> 48:21.600]  a weaponized tick-borne syphilis that gets into the brain and then no one will
[48:21.600 --> 48:24.800]  treat you I'll tell you they'll just say oh you're mentally ill so there's a lot
[48:24.800 --> 48:28.800]  of mentally ill people out there but there are real MK ultra mind control
[48:28.800 --> 48:32.240]  programs they even have shows on history channel about that where thousands of
[48:32.240 --> 48:37.120]  kids were running through Dr. Ewing Cameron's system there was sexual
[48:37.120 --> 48:42.640]  abuse as well and they would publicly I mean I mean I've admitted that they
[48:42.640 --> 48:47.720]  would basically erase their memories and create a tomaton so I know that that's
[48:47.720 --> 48:52.240]  out there sir and I'm sorry that you've been going through that thank you for
[48:52.240 --> 48:56.760]  the call they just gave us an article here hundreds of innocent people wrongly
[48:56.760 --> 49:02.000]  spied on by police it's just wasn't wrongly spied on they just do it let's
[49:02.000 --> 49:08.360]  go ahead and take another call Fred in Canada you're on the air hello hey buddy
[49:08.360 --> 49:15.280]  hey how are you doing good I just want to let you know we got a lot of Jonesers
[49:15.280 --> 49:22.240]  up here Canada and I was just getting a little creeped out here because you know
[49:22.240 --> 49:26.520]  there's no mention of of Canada or anything like that and all this they
[49:26.520 --> 49:36.840]  can't help but feel like Austria in World War two you know but we've got a good
[49:36.840 --> 49:43.960]  Prime Minister here I know because I live in his riding and he got he scrapped a
[49:43.960 --> 49:49.240]  gun registration there was a gun registration he got rid of it so yes
[49:49.240 --> 49:55.120]  things have begun to reverse in Canada because the public has a woken to what's
[49:55.120 --> 50:02.560]  happening and wherever good people take action evil runs but Canada basically is
[50:02.560 --> 50:09.280]  more and more under the SPP and also the Asia Pacific Union and so that you're
[50:09.280 --> 50:12.360]  being integrated into a corporates government your sovereignty is being
[50:12.360 --> 50:17.600]  eroded but your sovereignty is already eroded because the Queen and her
[50:17.600 --> 50:23.640]  Director General is able to suspend your parliament whenever they don't do what
[50:23.640 --> 50:27.000]  they want so you've got the Queen eroding your sovereignty but Canada does
[50:27.000 --> 50:31.400]  have more sovereignty than the past and then you've also got Northcom trying to
[50:31.400 --> 50:34.840]  absorb your sovereignty so that's basically what's happening with Canada we
[50:34.840 --> 50:38.440]  talk quite a bit about Canada but I mean basically you're you're going under
[50:38.440 --> 50:41.880]  the same standardized global government whatever's happening Australia is
[50:41.880 --> 50:45.200]  happening here whatever's happening in Canada is happening in England Germany
[50:45.200 --> 50:49.760]  I mean it's a global standardized program different countries are further along at
[50:49.760 --> 50:54.520]  different levels you see what I'm saying I hear ya yeah all right thank you sir
[50:54.520 --> 50:59.680]  does that answer your question yeah it sure does thank you Patrick Alain Scott

[59:04.400 --> 59:08.640]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity
[59:08.640 --> 59:13.240]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[59:13.240 --> 59:17.240]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[59:17.240 --> 59:21.600]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is
[59:21.600 --> 59:25.320]  always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their

[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:41.320]  the next segment Larry Grathwall inside the weathermen incredible

[01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:56.360]  truly let's go ahead and talk to Cindy in Illinois Cindy you're on the air hey
[01:00:56.360 --> 01:01:04.520]  that's me welcome I have a question a previous caller kind of asked the same
[01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:09.160]  question but I'm going to word it a little bit differently how are how is the
[01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:14.200]  system going to use our debt against us because the majority of Americans are
[01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:19.240]  in debt either credit card debt student loan debt mortgage debt so how are they
[01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:26.160]  going to use that against us they are changing all the different laws where
[01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:30.480]  where the way they throw you in debtors prison is claim you didn't turn in a
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:34.240]  silver spoon your grandma gave you when you declare bankruptcy and they throw
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:38.640]  you in prison for it they've changed the bankruptcy laws to where they're
[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:42.880]  total fraud now and bankruptcy is biblical now Jubilee but they've just
[01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:47.160]  gotten rid of that you've got countries in Africa that had a billion dollar loan
[01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:50.200]  they've paid back you know 60 billion and still own up you know a hundred
[01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:53.680]  billion in interest I mean it's all fraud they've got the Department of
[01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:58.960]  Education SWAT teaming people and they don't even have any statutory power
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:02.800]  there it's not illegal to not pay back a student loan but they still SWAT team
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:08.040]  you I mean that's mainstream news look it up folks so it's just total lawlessness
[01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:14.080]  where they want to bankrupt everybody and then make you agree to terms to go
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:18.520]  under government receivership basically on to government debt forgiveness with a
[01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:22.320]  government pays back your debt with other people's money and and with
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:27.760]  inflation and then you agree to take vaccines to live in a smaller house to
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:33.080]  do what they say so it's a managed economy they're moving us to
[01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:39.240]  see yeah I you know I'm a normal 27 year old I have a lot of student loan debt
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:44.120]  that I'm working to pay down so I was just you know that's just one of my one
[01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:48.600]  of my worries well look they're not gonna be able to enforce this on
[01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:52.040]  everybody and remember the I mean if you borrow something from your neighbor
[01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:57.440]  that hurts some of you don't pay it back these mega banks have gotten over 30
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:01.320]  plus trillion now the numbers don't really come out in the last few years
[01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:04.920]  it was 27 trillion and I saw Bloomberg saying I'm over 40 trillion but they
[01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:09.760]  they've gotten trillions of your tax money which they then loan out to
[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:15.520]  everybody at interest and so when I was in college and had no money and lived in
[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:21.040]  a tiny one-room apartment they would send me two three credit cards a week in
[01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:25.560]  my mailbox and then once I established myself they don't ever send me credit
[01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:30.800]  cards they don't send credit cards to people that aren't in debt they want you
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:35.600]  in debt for life it is predatory loan sharking and illegal loan sharking
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:41.400]  rates and it's all a fraud so you know there's there's some schools of thought
[01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:46.600]  I'm not saying do this but run up debt with Bank of America chase all of them
[01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:50.000]  do whatever do whatever you want and never pay any of it back because it's
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:54.480]  all made up anyways and I'm not saying do that but but I mean that's what a lot
[01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:58.160]  of people are doing that's what rich people do did you know that a lot of
[01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:01.520]  most rich people I mean so-called Nouveau Riche they know how to declare
[01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:05.680]  bankruptcy not pay things all this day and and then they throw the book at
[01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:10.400]  little people most the tax collectors go after folks making less than $30,000 a
[01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:16.320]  year I mean it's all just geared so the government class and the rich class can
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:21.120]  rip everybody off but then they sell you the solution of higher taxes to get the
[01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:26.200]  rich eat the rich the problem is those are just going to be taxes on the working
[01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:30.080]  wealthy and the working middle class to give it to them in bailouts you see how
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:34.240]  that's more sophisticated but it's not a nice sound bite for CNN for class
[01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:39.120]  warfare right all right well thanks for answering my question yeah thank you yeah
[01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:42.000]  I don't think I mean there's not much they can do to you if you don't pay off
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:48.400]  your so-called debts I mean they overcharge for most these colleges it
[01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:51.920]  was a Ponzi scheme most people aren't gonna be able to ever pay it back
[01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:56.280]  properly or you're gonna be slaves for 20 years doing it but you'll have bad credit
[01:04:56.280 --> 01:05:02.000]  for seven years so I mean what you're gonna do I blow it all off

[01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:09.480]  storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that in a real meltdown
[01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:13.320]  non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold it's true
[01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:16.440]  seeds that all perform even gold and silver before in this country and it's
[01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:20.400]  possible that could even happen again so our friends at solutions from science
[01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:25.120]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival

[01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:45.840]  we're gold to hit 2,000 by year-end on more fed easing Merrill Lynch is saying
[01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:50.200]  and see they've artificially driven gold down but that's always been the plan
[01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:54.320]  according to all the experts I've talked to who I respect is that they would drive
[01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:58.160]  it down and then when QE3 came out which we thought would be earlier this year
[01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:02.480]  now they're saying to me later this year that it will cause inflation so we're
[01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:07.760]  gonna be going over that Moody's downgrades Italy debt rating two notches
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:13.360]  JP Morgan loses 4.4 billion on trades traders may have hidden losses JP
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:19.040]  Morgan's been caught grabbing other accounts not just MF global amazing
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:26.160]  things happening but also given to Condi Rice who says she supports abortion and
[01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:30.120]  that's who they're saying Mitt Romney drudge report broke this yesterday it's
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:33.840]  since been confirmed that that's she's up at the top of the list I mean it's just
[01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:39.440]  horrible so there you go might as well just be how about he just runs as the
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:45.160]  new VP for Obama but we're gonna be joined here for the rest the hour by
[01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:49.480]  Larry Graf wall we've played the clip many times over the years I'm very
[01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:53.760]  honored to have him on with us I think it's best if he described who he is to
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:57.840]  you because his bio is so lengthy but he was at the very top of the weatherman
[01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:02.920]  and was able to you know I got you know really helped send him to prison and of
[01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:07.360]  course the weathermen had admitted what they did bombing police you name it and
[01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:12.120]  then Bill Clinton let him out of jail so just amazing the type of stuff they
[01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:16.480]  engaged in real terrorists actually engaging in real terror attacks in
[01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:21.200]  America and their Obama's mentors I mean they paid for his houses took care of
[01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:26.040]  him it's incredible but but since we saw the new army
[01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:33.440]  since we saw the new army document just a few months ago were they confirmed yes
[01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:38.480]  that's our real document for reeducation camps in America and and now
[01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:41.760]  they're getting ready for all this I mean we need to understand they could try
[01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:47.400]  some type of takeover of America and arrest what they see is the counter
[01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:51.560]  revolution so we're going to talk to Larry here in a moment and give you his
[01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:57.600]  websites as well but here he is in the 1980s documentary exposing what was
[01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:02.880]  going on at the highest levels of the weathermen here's that clip I brought up
[01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:07.320]  the subject of what's going to happen after we take over the government you
[01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:13.400]  know we we become responsible then for administrating you know 250 million
[01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:21.440]  people and there was no answers no one had given any thought to economics how
[01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:25.720]  are you going to close and feed these people the only thing that I could get
[01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:29.320]  was that they expected that the Cubans and the North Vietnamese and the
[01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:34.040]  Chinese and the Russians would all want to occupy different portions of the
[01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:38.960]  United States they also believed that their immediate responsibility would be
[01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:44.240]  to protect against what they called the counter revolution and they felt that
[01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:50.000]  this counter revolution could best be guarded against by creating and
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:56.600]  establishing re-education centers in the Southwest where we would take all the
[01:11:56.600 --> 01:12:02.560]  people who needed to be re-educated into the new way of thinking and teach them
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:07.840]  how things were going to be I ask well what is going to happen to those people
[01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:14.240]  that we can't re-educate that are diehard capitalists and the reply was
[01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:18.920]  that they'd have to be eliminated and when I pursued this further they
[01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:23.480]  estimated that they would have to eliminate 25 million people in these
[01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:29.400]  re-education centers and when I say eliminate I mean kill 25 million people
[01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:36.760]  I want you to imagine sitting in a room with 25 people most of which have
[01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:45.080]  graduate degrees from Columbia and other well-known educational centers and
[01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:51.560]  hear them figuring out the logistics for the elimination of 25 million people
[01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:58.800]  and they were dead serious that's from 1982 documentary no place to hide the
[01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:02.000]  whole thing's online if you want to see it just type in no place to hide Larry
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.920]  Grathwald his bio is so lengthy and all the things he's done so interesting I'm
[01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:13.480]  not going to have time to go over it all but Larry101st.blogspot.com or just
[01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:17.320]  type in you know we'll just put a link up in the guest area today well you asked
[01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:21.280]  them to actually put a link up at infowars.com on his name to his
[01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:25.160]  website because you know we do that sometimes for guests especially the
[01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:28.840]  websites long instead of just mentioning it on there we're gonna add a link that
[01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:32.080]  his site where his law documentation there and again he helped put the
[01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:35.760]  weathermen behind bars and the weathermen are quite proud of what they did he
[01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:42.080]  was Vietnam veteran first infantry brigade in Vietnam 101st Airborne
[01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:45.920]  Division and we'll just start there Larry I want to you know obviously look
[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:50.760]  through the lens of what you witnessed inside the Chicago Communist Mafia back
[01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:55.760]  then versus who's in control today because more and more what you've written
[01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:59.120]  and said I look at what they're doing and it looks like they're trying to do it
[01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:02.680]  and it's if they think they're gonna get away with it they're crazy but but
[01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:07.360]  briefly tell us about yourself and what you experienced take us back to
[01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:10.920]  infiltrating the weathermen at the highest levels what you saw and then
[01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:15.680]  bring us forward to today what we're facing well that would be a long story
[01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:22.560]  but essentially I had been discharged from the Army in 1968 and I was
[01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:28.400]  attending the University of Cincinnati when I was approached by members of what
[01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:33.840]  was then called the weathermen and they wanted me to go to Chicago with them to
[01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:39.960]  for the attack on Chicago it was called the days of rage that was held on
[01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:49.680]  October 8th through the 11th of 1969 my first reaction was to think that these
[01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:54.640]  people were were crazy as a matter of fact I even made a comment that you know
[01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:58.760]  why go to Chicago to get the pigs you can stay right here and get as many as
[01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:05.440]  you want but they gave me a literature and I took it home and read it and
[01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:09.960]  ultimately wound up going to the Cincinnati Police Department to tell
[01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:14.320]  them about what you know I had encountered and they asked me to go to
[01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:21.200]  some meetings which I did and what what I found it very astounding was that these
[01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:28.920]  people were extremely well organized they were organizing people into what
[01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:34.720]  they called affinity groups of four or five people that would work together on
[01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:42.120]  the streets of Chicago the sole purpose is they over emphasized was to attack
[01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:47.200]  the police and the establishment and property whenever the possibility
[01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:53.520]  existed and while I didn't go to Chicago for this national action the
[01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:59.120]  weathermen themselves did everything that they said they were going to do when
[01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:05.040]  they returned to Cincinnati they got back in touch with me and asked me to to
[01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:12.080]  start attending meetings again and at that time I went to the FBI I had come
[01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:17.000]  to the conclusion that the Cincinnati Police were not in a position to deal
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:23.160]  with this organization because of its national roots rather than it being
[01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:30.040]  local and confined to just Cincinnati the FBI of course was somewhat astounded
[01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:34.960]  by the fact that I walked in off the street and interestingly enough they
[01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:42.560]  had my military file there on the desk one when they interviewed me and I think
[01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:48.800]  they were you know kind of taken back that someone would would volunteer to
[01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:58.760]  do this surprisingly the weathermen had had attended meetings in Cuba in the
[01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:03.920]  summer of 1969 in the early summer during which the Cubans in the north
[01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:09.360]  vietnamese that criticized them for what they referred to as white skin
[01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:15.640]  privilege and they chided the weathermen that they were an intellectual group
[01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:20.360]  versus the true revolutionary group and that they needed to start recruiting
[01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:28.240]  people from the working class from from the military vietnam veterans and
[01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:36.440]  people who were streetwise and here I am I'm all of those things and so you know
[01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:42.000]  it happened at a very opportune time as far as my being able to infiltrate the
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:48.880]  group ultimately when the group went underground in December of well actually
[01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:54.800]  the decision to go underground was made in December of 1969 of the the group
[01:17:54.800 --> 01:18:03.200]  actually went underground in January of 70 and I was the only informant left
[01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:09.280]  after they had purged the group what they did was kick anybody out that they
[01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:14.200]  didn't think was capable of going underground with them their belief
[01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:20.560]  being that you had to be fervently dedicated to the revolution and and
[01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:25.880]  mentally and emotionally capable of committing these acts of strategic
[01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:33.760]  sabotage it was planned that we were going to place bombs and kill people
[01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:43.160]  assassinate people kidnap people amongst other things to to essentially serve the
[01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:49.840]  the north vietnamese and other of national liberation of fights in the
[01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:58.080]  world and ultimately to bring the US government down to destroy US imperialism
[01:18:58.080 --> 01:19:01.880]  but what were the communists thinking I mean if that really would have happened
[01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:06.480]  and some of it did it would only unify people against communist but I mean it's
[01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:10.880]  such a sophisticated question but I guess nowadays we're losing all our
[01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:14.360]  liberties because of so-called terrorist threats it's just ridiculous well
[01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:19.440]  actually I think that that after the group went underground and began their
[01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:24.640]  strategic sabotage they they began to realize especially with the end of the
[01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:31.920]  war in Vietnam the support group the youth movement as they called it dissipated
[01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:37.480]  it no longer had a key issue to be organized around and I think that that
[01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:46.720]  when they when they surface during the 80s they decided to to approach this on
[01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:51.160]  a more political level and I think that's where we find people like Barack
[01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:54.520]  Obama yeah stay there I want to come back and get into their plans to
[01:19:54.520 --> 01:20:01.880]  kill 25 million Americans and the fact they basically run the country today for

[01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:32.280]  inside the highest levels of the weatherman meetings many people that are
[01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:37.280]  advisors of the president friends of his all over the government their
[01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:43.280]  children in the government openly saying reeducation camps shows so
[01:24:43.280 --> 01:24:47.280]  accelerating this you're one of the only people able to infiltrate the highest
[01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:53.280]  levels as they go underground bring us to the point and maybe remind people of
[01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:56.280]  some of the terror attacks they launched and what they were planning to do once
[01:24:56.280 --> 01:25:00.280]  they got control sounds just like Russia or China where they just shut
[01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:04.280]  everything off and watch the case of China 60 something million starved to
[01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:10.280]  death I mean they're just just a bunch of demons please continue well that was
[01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:17.280]  actually was it a meeting that took place in Cleveland Ohio during the our
[01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:22.280]  preparation for going underground so actually this conversation concerning
[01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:28.280]  the 25 million people being eliminated was the was prior to the group beginning
[01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:35.280]  a strategic sabotage of what happened was we were actually planning how we were
[01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:39.280]  going to go about doing this who we were going to keep and who we were going
[01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:45.280]  to purge and during one of these meetings I asked well you know what are we going
[01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:51.280]  to do when we when we take over you know we obviously believe that we're going to
[01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:55.280]  succeed and and then we're going to be in charge we're going to have to do
[01:25:55.280 --> 01:26:00.280]  something and people sat there and looked at me like I had three heads I
[01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:05.280]  guess it had never really been considered but then the conversation
[01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:10.280]  focused on the first priority would be to protect ourselves against the counter
[01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:16.280]  revolution of the belief being that that there would be an upwelling of
[01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:24.280]  American patriots that would try to reverse the our success in the
[01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:30.280]  revolution and that we would have to protect ourselves and you know the new
[01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:39.280]  socialism against that event so it was decided that a part approximately 100
[01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:45.280]  million people would have to be reeducated some of them being placed in
[01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:52.280]  reeducation camps that would be built in the southwest and that of this
[01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:58.280]  approximately 100 million people approximately a quarter or 25 million
[01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:04.280]  would not be reeducated and therefore would have to be eliminated now the
[01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:09.280]  means of eliminating these people of course was to kill them and in some
[01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:14.280]  instances they would simply be starved to death in other instances such as
[01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:19.280]  people like myself who had worked against the revolution would be
[01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:25.280]  immediately shot or executed in some way of course that would include people
[01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:31.280]  like Nixon and others who were too conservative to even wait the time
[01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:37.280]  of trying to reeducate them the amazing thing was to consider that of these
[01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:45.280]  people that were attending this meeting Bill Ayers, Mark Redd, Linda Evans,
[01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:50.280]  Kathy Wilkerson, these are all well educated people they come from upper
[01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:57.280]  middle class or upper class background and in most cases it attended some of
[01:27:57.280 --> 01:28:00.280]  the most prestigious universities in the country.
[01:28:00.280 --> 01:28:04.280]  They weren't just shooting their mouths off everything they talked about they
[01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:08.280]  were trying to carry out I mean they they bombed police officers they killed
[01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:15.280]  I mean they they killed people oh yeah the interesting story is after we went
[01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:20.280]  underground I was assigned to Detroit Michigan and then Detroit Bill Ayers
[01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:27.280]  had created a cell very large cell it contained about seven or eight people
[01:28:27.280 --> 01:28:33.280]  and he told us that we should put bombs at the 13th precinct the police precinct
[01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:39.280]  and the Detroit police officers association building that we should
[01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:44.280]  time these bombings to go off simultaneously and to place the bomb
[01:28:44.280 --> 01:28:48.280]  at a time when it would kill the greatest number of people.
[01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:54.280]  There was a red barn restaurant next door to the DPOA building and I pointed
[01:28:54.280 --> 01:28:59.280]  out that that would probably sustain the most damage and since this restaurant
[01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:04.280]  was in the black neighborhood that it would obviously wind up killing a lot of
[01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:09.280]  blacks and his response was that sometimes in a revolution innocent people
[01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:16.280]  have to die I find that you know most disturbing because you know Bill
[01:29:16.280 --> 01:29:21.280]  claimed to have such loyalty to the black community and to the black liberation
[01:29:21.280 --> 01:29:27.280]  movement I would point out that I was reassigned to Madison, Wisconsin
[01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:33.280]  before these bombings actually took place and Larry Grathwald incredible long
[01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:37.280]  segment coming up let's continue with what they did after that other other
[01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:40.280]  mass killings they talked about what they plan to do once they took over and
[01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:44.280]  then I want to point out Homeland Security today is shifting from Al Qaeda
[01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:49.280]  to domestic groups and it's arranging itself to go after us the counter
[01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:51.280]  revolution.

[01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:11.280]  they were trying to recruit him and then volunteered because they were dangerous
[01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:17.280]  people to infiltrate them and he witnessed some incredible some incredible
[01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:21.280]  things Larry continuing with some of the crimes they committed and then what is it
[01:34:21.280 --> 01:34:25.280]  like for you to see Clinton let them out of prison and then Obama parading around
[01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:29.280]  with them and then meanwhile I'm sure you've seen all the homeland security
[01:34:29.280 --> 01:34:33.280]  reports that have come out where they're now saying gun owners libertarians
[01:34:33.280 --> 01:34:37.280]  returning veterans people that don't like a global government or socialist
[01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:43.280]  healthcare or a new world order we're now the terrorist as they announce this
[01:34:43.280 --> 01:34:48.280]  new world order they're teaching the police is the police are the ones that
[01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:53.280]  send it to us that literally the founding fathers are bad the exact type of stuff
[01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:57.280]  you'd imagine to have mouse a tongue teaching or something please continue
[01:34:57.280 --> 01:35:03.280]  yes well let me finish about Detroit the I was reassigned to Madison Wisconsin
[01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:09.280]  and I didn't actually participate in those bombings but Bill Ayers debriefed
[01:35:09.280 --> 01:35:15.280]  us extensively and when I left Detroit I told the FBI that I believe that those
[01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:21.280]  bombings would take place within a couple of days of the original target date
[01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:27.280]  ironically they had a surveillance on those locations but they didn't see the
[01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:34.280]  bomb place and they found 13 six of dynamite at the DPO a building and 34
[01:35:34.280 --> 01:35:40.280]  six dynamite at the 13th precinct the bomb at the 13th precinct was set to go
[01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:45.280]  off during a shift change and it was placed on a window let the bomb itself
[01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:54.280]  consisted of dynamite and fence staples and roofing nails to act as shrapnel
[01:35:54.280 --> 01:36:00.280]  in other words to kill and wound now what's important about this is that
[01:36:00.280 --> 01:36:05.280]  that bomb that was left in in those two locations in Detroit is an exact
[01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:11.280]  duplicate of the bomb that was placed at the park police station in San Francisco
[01:36:11.280 --> 01:36:18.280]  and in February of 1970 that resulted in the death of Sergeant Brian McDonald
[01:36:18.280 --> 01:36:24.280]  the bomb was placed on a window ledge it consisted of fence nails and I mean
[01:36:24.280 --> 01:36:30.280]  roofing nails and fence staples and so it was basically the same design
[01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:35.280]  now the park police station bomb or pardon me the Pine Street bomb factory
[01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:42.280]  that the FBI discovered Max Knoll and some FBI agents found it and it's
[01:36:42.280 --> 01:36:48.280]  fingerprints that were found at that location included Bill Ayers and several
[01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:54.280]  others and Bill Ayers during a criticism session told me that Bernadine
[01:36:54.280 --> 01:37:00.280]  Dorn had placed that bomb at the park police station and that and later this
[01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:07.280]  was confirmed by one of the members of the Weather Underground who turned
[01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:14.280]  her name was Karen Latimer and she said that she was the had driven Bernadine
[01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:19.280]  to the park police station the night of the bombing and the reason I make
[01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:24.280]  that point again is because of the similarity of the bombs used in
[01:37:24.280 --> 01:37:29.280]  Detroit and then the one at the park police station and the importance of
[01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:35.280]  this is that these are three bombings two attempts and one that actually occurred
[01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:42.280]  of many bombings that the weathermen were involved in during the 70s and the 80s
[01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:50.280]  so these people were serious and their point of strategic sabotage and their
[01:37:50.280 --> 01:37:54.280]  goal of overthrowing the government and they seriously believed that they were
[01:37:54.280 --> 01:38:00.280]  going to succeed in destroying that the United States and what they called
[01:38:00.280 --> 01:38:07.280]  US imperialism now as far as the connections that exist today the you
[01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:12.280]  know it's amazing when you think about it that the president of the United
[01:38:12.280 --> 01:38:18.280]  States has been friends good friends with Bernadine Dorn and Bill Ayers and his
[01:38:18.280 --> 01:38:23.280]  response when he's been confronted with this fact is that well he was only
[01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:29.280]  eight years old when these events were occurring well that doesn't take anything
[01:38:29.280 --> 01:38:35.280]  away from the fact that he still friends with with ex domestic terrorists who
[01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:41.280]  have shown absolutely no repentance for what they did as a matter of fact Bill
[01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:47.280]  Ayers has stated that his only regret is that they didn't do enough and he's
[01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:53.280]  there's a picture of him standing on the American flag making a comment guilty
[01:38:53.280 --> 01:39:00.280]  as hell free as a bird is in America a wonderful country now that's throwing
[01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:06.280]  it in our face so to speak and you're right Bill Clinton has pardoned some
[01:39:06.280 --> 01:39:13.280]  of these people others such as Kathy Boudin has been paroled now Kathy Boudin
[01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:21.280]  and and her husband Dave Gilbert were involved in a brink robbery in New Jersey
[01:39:21.280 --> 01:39:27.280]  in the 80s that resulted in the death of a brink guard and two New Jersey state
[01:39:27.280 --> 01:39:33.280]  troopers this was a combination of the weathermen and the black liberation
[01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:41.280]  army now Dave Gilbert still in prison but can see Boudin has been paroled and
[01:39:41.280 --> 01:39:49.280]  her son Chessa was adopted and raised by Bernadine Dorn in Bill Ayers do you
[01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:55.280]  notice how these loops keep coming back it it's what about Frank Marshall Davis
[01:39:55.280 --> 01:39:59.280]  over and over again in his book Obama talks about how you go visiting when
[01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:04.280]  he's a little kid this is another communist agent on record I mean it's
[01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:10.280]  just it's bizarro and now he's the president and how does fast and furious
[01:40:10.280 --> 01:40:13.280]  tie into this I mean shipping guns to Mexico to blame the Second Amendment
[01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:19.280]  well that was the sole purpose it was to blame the Second Amendment they have
[01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:25.280]  been they meaning the liberals and the socialists the so-called progressive
[01:40:25.280 --> 01:40:30.280]  has been after the Second Amendment as long as I've been alive and possibly
[01:40:30.280 --> 01:40:37.280]  before that remember you know an unarmed populace is totally it's
[01:40:37.280 --> 01:40:41.280]  submissive to the will of the government that's real simple these people crave
[01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:44.280]  murdering and power and sit around licking their lips talking about
[01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:48.280]  killing 25 million of us and they hate it that they can't get our guns
[01:40:48.280 --> 01:40:54.280]  absolutely they want us unarmed so we can't defend ourselves and don't let
[01:40:54.280 --> 01:40:59.280]  anyone for you about the Second Amendment that was put in to the
[01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:04.280]  Bill of Rights because of the fact that this country had just bought a
[01:41:04.280 --> 01:41:09.280]  revolution against the most powerful country in the world and and the
[01:41:09.280 --> 01:41:15.280]  founding fathers wanted to make sure that we had the ability to control the
[01:41:15.280 --> 01:41:20.280]  government rather than it controlling us it has nothing to do with militia or
[01:41:20.280 --> 01:41:27.280]  fighting Indians or hunting is the the progress is like to tell us over and over
[01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:33.280]  again and and this Frank Marshall Davis by the way is the mentor of Barack
[01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:41.280]  Obama in his book dreams of my father he refers to Frank he doesn't say
[01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:46.280]  Frank Marshall Davis because Frank Marshall Davis was a registered
[01:41:46.280 --> 01:41:53.280]  communist member of the Communist Party USA and and was well known by the FBI
[01:41:53.280 --> 01:41:59.280]  and other government agencies it was the Trevor Loudon who figured out the
[01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:05.280]  connection between Frank Marshall Davis and Barack Obama he was also a
[01:42:05.280 --> 01:42:09.280]  pornographer and that's all covered in the film that we carry dreams of my
[01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:14.280]  real father at info warshop.com now now I want to stop right there because
[01:42:14.280 --> 01:42:18.280]  you've got a lot of knowledge that you've accrued since then you've spoken to
[01:42:18.280 --> 01:42:22.280]  the National Press Club and you know I've also tried to warn police and
[01:42:22.280 --> 01:42:27.280]  others about what's happening but what is it because studying guerrilla warfare
[01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:32.280]  that the communists love so much and all right you know tomes to whether it's
[01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:36.280]  linen or Mao or right through to Saul Alinsky I mean they're all obsessed with
[01:42:36.280 --> 01:42:40.280]  it when you look at how the government operates now under their control it
[01:42:40.280 --> 01:42:45.280]  every time we resist they pull back when we stand down they they rush forward
[01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:49.280]  and I mean more and more when I study how they operate they really are
[01:42:49.280 --> 01:42:54.280]  following a classic communist takeover strategy even though they're in control
[01:42:54.280 --> 01:42:58.280]  of a lot of the government now they're not in control the individuals so they
[01:42:58.280 --> 01:43:02.280]  have to put out these cover stories to try to get police and military and
[01:43:02.280 --> 01:43:06.280]  intelligence folks to follow their directives but I don't think it's
[01:43:06.280 --> 01:43:11.280]  working I think the big awakening is happening right now because these guys
[01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:16.280]  are at a disconnect but I mean what's your I mean I don't know if you've seen it
[01:43:16.280 --> 01:43:20.280]  but two months ago we got it the army said yes that's ours it's it's not
[01:43:20.280 --> 01:43:25.280]  classified but it's restricted you shouldn't have it it's up on info wars.com
[01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:30.280]  that there is now a reeducation camp plan and they talk they don't say who
[01:43:30.280 --> 01:43:33.280]  they're going to put they just say reeducate political dissidents in them
[01:43:33.280 --> 01:43:36.280]  and I'm sure you've seen they're getting the military ready for civil unrest
[01:43:36.280 --> 01:43:41.280]  but but a lot of that will be to unrest they themselves generate so it's a
[01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:46.280]  sophisticated plan what is their helter skelter I guess Charlie Manson style
[01:43:46.280 --> 01:43:50.280]  plan or is that inaccurate I mean what are they planning to do now from deeply
[01:43:50.280 --> 01:43:54.280]  knowing them that they're in control what should we be looking for is what I'm saying
[01:43:54.280 --> 01:43:59.280]  well it's you know it's a difficult question to answer but I can I can agree
[01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:05.280]  with you 100% and possibly go further by noting the fact that the homeland
[01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:11.280]  security and the name by the name of Nancy Palatano has stated that the
[01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:16.280]  greatest threat to US security is veterans.
[01:44:16.280 --> 01:44:24.280]  In other words the domestic threat today is is not al-Qaeda or or you know some
[01:44:24.280 --> 01:44:31.280]  other Islamic radicals but it's rather the the veterans you know who have fought
[01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:39.280]  our wars for it and I you know frankly I know of very few veterans who have
[01:44:39.280 --> 01:44:44.280]  determined that their goal in life is to overthrow the government the other unless
[01:44:44.280 --> 01:44:49.280]  that's a false globalist communist takeover government and the and the
[01:44:49.280 --> 01:44:54.280]  criminals that have hijacked things know their only enemy is armed Americans
[01:44:54.280 --> 01:44:58.280]  that understand a takeover's happened as they told you they've got to go after
[01:44:58.280 --> 01:45:03.280]  the counter revolution that's going to be George Washington mom and apple pie
[01:45:03.280 --> 01:45:09.280]  loving veterans that's what's happening right now the you know the attack is is
[01:45:09.280 --> 01:45:17.280]  on you know that the veterans and other patriots who are standing up and
[01:45:17.280 --> 01:45:22.280]  fighting against them you know the focus on Rush Limbaugh and I don't always
[01:45:22.280 --> 01:45:28.280]  agree with rush but you know look at look at the biggest if they can shoot him
[01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:32.280]  down and say that he's a terrorist and all this they can get everybody and
[01:45:32.280 --> 01:45:37.280]  they're and they're and he's he's in the bullseye and and that's what they're
[01:45:37.280 --> 01:45:43.280]  trying to do and remember that the average American is too busy working and
[01:45:43.280 --> 01:45:49.280]  paying bills that to be focused on politics the way these people are these
[01:45:49.280 --> 01:45:55.280]  people eat breathe and sleep politics and Bill Ayers and Bernardine Dorn are a
[01:45:55.280 --> 01:46:01.280]  perfect example and most recently Bill has made a comment that a new order
[01:46:01.280 --> 01:46:08.280]  is coming now why is he saying that remember this is a guy who who prays
[01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:14.280]  the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy because of his
[01:46:14.280 --> 01:46:20.280]  belief that the liberals co-opted the revolution in other words when issues
[01:46:20.280 --> 01:46:25.280]  became clear they came up with a solution and there was no longer anything
[01:46:25.280 --> 01:46:32.280]  for people to fight against so I am I sat in a room and listen to him you know
[01:46:32.280 --> 01:46:38.280]  explain why these assassinations were a good thing and now he's an avid supporter
[01:46:38.280 --> 01:46:44.280]  of the most liberal president that we've ever had Barack Obama why is that is
[01:46:44.280 --> 01:46:49.280]  it possible that there's another agenda well here's something I've been told
[01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:53.280]  by a lot of high-up sources that are very credible they say these people aren't
[01:46:53.280 --> 01:46:59.280]  above killing Obama so that they could cause some type of race war in the US
[01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:03.280]  have you ever gotten that information I've heard that and I you know it's a
[01:47:03.280 --> 01:47:10.280]  interesting proposition it certainly is not something that I would put beyond
[01:47:10.280 --> 01:47:16.280]  them but at the same time I wonder if they're not looking at him as somebody
[01:47:16.280 --> 01:47:22.280]  who is doing their bidding if you look at like fast and furious the programs that
[01:47:22.280 --> 01:47:29.280]  have come into existence under his administration are right for being
[01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:33.280]  attacked and they're being attacked by the government the very government
[01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:39.280]  supposed to support them they have no no love of the Constitution or the bill
[01:47:39.280 --> 01:47:45.280]  of rights and and Obama has made that very clear and as far as lying to us
[01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:52.280]  is concerned he you know the the the health care of you know Obamacare was
[01:47:52.280 --> 01:47:56.280]  not attacked right well guess what when they went to the Supreme Court they
[01:47:56.280 --> 01:48:01.280]  argued that it was attacked and the Supreme Court upheld it the and now
[01:48:01.280 --> 01:48:04.280]  they're going to give illegal aliens the free health care I saw and they were
[01:48:04.280 --> 01:48:07.280]  bragging in the news the other day that see this is the promised wealth
[01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:11.280]  transfer sure but all it's going to do is bankrupt the country which is what
[01:48:11.280 --> 01:48:15.280]  they want they want to bankrupt the country
[01:48:15.280 --> 01:48:23.280]  I can't remember it the Cleveland Pevin or Klein Pevin which is to put as
[01:48:23.280 --> 01:48:29.280]  much stress on the government as you possibly can and force it to collapse
[01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:33.280]  but what's happening as far as local government and state government are
[01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:38.280]  concerned in regards to the pensions and things that they've promised to
[01:48:38.280 --> 01:48:43.280]  government workers which they no longer are able to fund and at the same time
[01:48:43.280 --> 01:48:50.280]  fund the current police force or fire department and it's designed to make
[01:48:50.280 --> 01:48:56.280]  the public become exhausted as well just standard communist takeover doctrine
[01:48:56.280 --> 01:49:00.280]  how do you square it with their funding though the big mega foundations and
[01:49:00.280 --> 01:49:04.280]  globalist kind of crony interest I mean certainly there's that connection it's
[01:49:04.280 --> 01:49:09.280]  covered in the film none dare call it a conspiracy yes or the book none dare
[01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:12.280]  call it conspiracy I thought about trying to make a film about this so out of
[01:49:12.280 --> 01:49:16.280]  Freudian slip there but the point is is that is that you also have these
[01:49:16.280 --> 01:49:21.280]  ultra rich who want monopolies who are anti-middle class always funding
[01:49:21.280 --> 01:49:27.280]  communist any comments on that well for us is a good example and you know he's
[01:49:27.280 --> 01:49:33.280]  made billions off of this very thing and and you you have to wonder
[01:49:33.280 --> 01:49:40.280]  how does he swear this up with you know first capitalism versus socialism I
[01:49:40.280 --> 01:49:48.280]  guess he supposes that that that his support of this revolution is going to
[01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:55.280]  put him in good stead with people like Bill Ayers and Barack Obama when
[01:49:55.280 --> 01:50:01.280]  when they ultimately succeed you know there's no other way to explain it I
[01:50:01.280 --> 01:50:07.280]  you know I've said for years that it amazes me that millionaires support this
[01:50:07.280 --> 01:50:14.280]  because at the end of the revolution when when the weathermen or groups like
[01:50:14.280 --> 01:50:18.280]  them take over these are some of the first people that are going to be put
[01:50:18.280 --> 01:50:24.280]  against the wall and shot and yet they you know they blindly continue to follow
[01:50:24.280 --> 01:50:29.280]  the leader well the truth is they never let the revolution fully come into
[01:50:29.280 --> 01:50:34.280]  place and they put oligarchs in charge who then are in control of it so it's
[01:50:34.280 --> 01:50:38.280]  just organized crime masquerading as communist I mean I know you were around
[01:50:38.280 --> 01:50:41.280]  these people when they were young and they really believed it but I mean so
[01:50:41.280 --> 01:50:45.280]  much of it is there they just have an appetite to kill people and have power
[01:50:45.280 --> 01:50:48.280]  and they hate the middle class and they hate freedom I want to come back and
[01:50:48.280 --> 01:50:52.280]  get your take on that I mean crystallized for us who are these people
[01:50:52.280 --> 01:50:55.280]  because if they love Obama and help putting through school and he's their
[01:50:55.280 --> 01:51:03.280]  darling who is Obama what what makes this filth tick hi this is Alex Jones did

[01:54:44.280 --> 01:54:47.280]  who helped infiltrate the weathermen and also helped
[01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:50.280]  to testify against them that's a whole other story as our guest
[01:54:50.280 --> 01:54:53.280]  I am going to keep him 20 minutes in the next hour
[01:54:53.280 --> 01:54:56.280]  he's agreed to stay with us and open the phones up
[01:54:56.280 --> 01:55:00.280]  for your questions specifically for Larry Grathwall
[01:55:00.280 --> 01:55:03.280]  on the weathermen
[01:55:03.280 --> 01:55:06.280]  who go on television and stand on American flags
[01:55:06.280 --> 01:55:09.280]  and look America's been taken over by corrupt interest
[01:55:09.280 --> 01:55:13.280]  and does a lot of bad things but when they say they want to stand on the American flag
[01:55:13.280 --> 01:55:16.280]  they mean private property, the family, bill of rights, constitution
[01:55:16.280 --> 01:55:18.280]  these are really nasty people
[01:55:18.280 --> 01:55:22.280]  and Larry Grathwall was around them in their top meetings
[01:55:22.280 --> 01:55:24.280]  he can tell us what type of people they really are
[01:55:24.280 --> 01:55:27.280]  here in a moment but if you want to understand how the ultra-rich
[01:55:27.280 --> 01:55:30.280]  fund communists, none dare call a conspiracy
[01:55:30.280 --> 01:55:32.280]  the book that woke me up by Gary Allen
[01:55:32.280 --> 01:55:35.280]  available at infowars.com
[01:55:35.280 --> 01:55:37.280]  discounted and with a free citizen rulebook
[01:55:37.280 --> 01:55:39.280]  and dreams from my real father
[01:55:39.280 --> 01:55:41.280]  by director Joel Gilbert
[01:55:41.280 --> 01:55:43.280]  getting into Frank Marshall Davis
[01:55:43.280 --> 01:55:46.280]  in the real providence where Obama really came from
[01:55:46.280 --> 01:55:49.280]  all at infowarshop.com
[01:55:49.280 --> 01:55:52.280]  or 888-253-3139
[01:55:52.280 --> 01:55:58.280]  and our guest website is Larry101ST.blogspot.com
[01:55:58.280 --> 01:56:04.280]  we have a link up in the guest area to his site at infowars.com
[01:56:04.280 --> 01:56:07.280]  but you have monopoly mafia rich people
[01:56:07.280 --> 01:56:09.280]  who want to work with communism
[01:56:09.280 --> 01:56:12.280]  because they can get the underclass going along
[01:56:12.280 --> 01:56:14.280]  with the consolidation of wealth
[01:56:14.280 --> 01:56:17.280]  but you never get the chicken in every pot
[01:56:17.280 --> 01:56:20.280]  that's my take on it. Larry, what makes these people tick?
[01:56:20.280 --> 01:56:22.280]  Were they true believers when you were around them?
[01:56:22.280 --> 01:56:24.280]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:56:24.280 --> 01:56:29.280]  I mean, at least as far as what they paid lip service to
[01:56:29.280 --> 01:56:34.280]  I often question their individual motives
[01:56:34.280 --> 01:56:38.280]  from a psychological perspective
[01:56:38.280 --> 01:56:41.280]  and by the way, I have a degree in psychology
[01:56:41.280 --> 01:56:44.280]  so I'm somewhat qualified to do that
[01:56:44.280 --> 01:56:46.280]  I didn't at the time
[01:56:46.280 --> 01:56:50.280]  but the fact is that a lot of them are motivated
[01:56:50.280 --> 01:56:51.280]  for different reasons
[01:56:51.280 --> 01:56:53.280]  I think Bill Ayers is an example
[01:56:53.280 --> 01:56:58.280]  is one of those people who left after power
[01:56:58.280 --> 01:57:01.280]  he loved being in charge
[01:57:01.280 --> 01:57:04.280]  he loved to be able to come into a room
[01:57:04.280 --> 01:57:08.280]  and have people become silent
[01:57:08.280 --> 01:57:10.280]  waiting to listen to him
[01:57:10.280 --> 01:57:13.280]  and wait for his instructions
[01:57:13.280 --> 01:57:17.280]  and to be able to order people to commit certain things
[01:57:17.280 --> 01:57:21.280]  such as the bombings in Detroit
[01:57:21.280 --> 01:57:26.280]  so each one of them I'm sure had
[01:57:26.280 --> 01:57:29.280]  their own individual motivations
[01:57:29.280 --> 01:57:32.280]  but I think Ayers, more than others
[01:57:32.280 --> 01:57:38.280]  was certainly motivated by a lust or a desire for power
[01:57:38.280 --> 01:57:42.280]  and I think you see that in all of his life
[01:57:42.280 --> 01:57:46.280]  he became a doctor of education
[01:57:46.280 --> 01:57:52.280]  he was a professor at the University of Illinois
[01:57:52.280 --> 01:57:56.280]  his father was the president, CEO of Con Edison
[01:57:56.280 --> 01:57:58.280]  in the state of Illinois
[01:57:58.280 --> 01:58:02.280]  so he's been, you know, come from a very wealthy family
[01:58:02.280 --> 01:58:06.280]  and as a matter of fact
[01:58:06.280 --> 01:58:10.280]  a mailman who used to deliver mail to Thomas Ayers
[01:58:10.280 --> 01:58:14.280]  his father claimed that he met Barack Obama
[01:58:14.280 --> 01:58:17.280]  while he was a student
[01:58:17.280 --> 01:58:23.280]  and that he recognized him later in years
[01:58:23.280 --> 01:58:26.280]  he said I'm going to be the president
[01:58:26.280 --> 01:58:28.280]  he told him he was going to be the president
[01:58:28.280 --> 01:58:31.280]  and isn't that interesting that that connection
[01:58:31.280 --> 01:58:34.280]  exists to the Ayers family
[01:58:34.280 --> 01:58:36.280]  and you know Bill Ayers and...
[01:58:36.280 --> 01:58:38.280]  I'll tell you what, stay there

[02:01:02.280 --> 02:01:04.280]  he's got coming up in DC
[02:01:04.280 --> 02:01:07.280]  Larry Graphwall again is our guest
[02:01:07.280 --> 02:01:09.280]  Larry you were finishing a point before we go to calls
[02:01:09.280 --> 02:01:12.280]  about the Ares family and Obama
[02:01:12.280 --> 02:01:15.280]  well I see I wanted to make the comment
[02:01:15.280 --> 02:01:18.280]  that Bill Ares and Barack Obama
[02:01:18.280 --> 02:01:21.280]  were attending the University of Columbia
[02:01:21.280 --> 02:01:23.280]  at the same time
[02:01:23.280 --> 02:01:25.280]  which you know
[02:01:25.280 --> 02:01:28.280]  combined with the fact that this mailman
[02:01:28.280 --> 02:01:30.280]  knows of a connection
[02:01:30.280 --> 02:01:33.280]  between Barack and the Ares family
[02:01:33.280 --> 02:01:36.280]  while he was an undergrad
[02:01:36.280 --> 02:01:40.280]  tells me that you know Bill and
[02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:43.280]  Barack have known each other for a lot longer
[02:01:43.280 --> 02:01:46.280]  than what either one has been willing to admit
[02:01:46.280 --> 02:01:49.280]  and as a matter of fact Bill Ares has acknowledged
[02:01:49.280 --> 02:01:53.280]  the fact that he wrote a dream to my father
[02:01:53.280 --> 02:01:56.280]  as a ghost writer so
[02:01:56.280 --> 02:01:59.280]  I mean these guys are basically family
[02:01:59.280 --> 02:02:02.280]  because they're very proud of the son of Frank Marshall Davis
[02:02:02.280 --> 02:02:04.280]  what do you think of that theory
[02:02:04.280 --> 02:02:06.280]  well
[02:02:06.280 --> 02:02:08.280]  you know if you look at the pictures
[02:02:08.280 --> 02:02:10.280]  side by side it makes a lot of sense
[02:02:10.280 --> 02:02:12.280]  Barack looks more like Frank Marshall Davis
[02:02:12.280 --> 02:02:14.280]  than he does
[02:02:14.280 --> 02:02:16.280]  of Barack Obama
[02:02:16.280 --> 02:02:18.280]  and he says his dad
[02:02:18.280 --> 02:02:20.280]  his grandfather would take him over there every week
[02:02:20.280 --> 02:02:22.280]  and there was this weird unspoken thing
[02:02:22.280 --> 02:02:24.280]  between his grandfather
[02:02:24.280 --> 02:02:26.280]  and Frank Marshall Davis I mean
[02:02:26.280 --> 02:02:28.280]  what are you doing taking your kid over to some weird
[02:02:28.280 --> 02:02:30.280]  communist pornographers house every week
[02:02:30.280 --> 02:02:32.280]  keep in mind too
[02:02:32.280 --> 02:02:34.280]  that that grandfather
[02:02:34.280 --> 02:02:36.280]  had worked for the CIA
[02:02:36.280 --> 02:02:38.280]  and when
[02:02:38.280 --> 02:02:40.280]  when his daughter
[02:02:40.280 --> 02:02:42.280]  became pregnant
[02:02:42.280 --> 02:02:44.280]  it makes sense that he wouldn't have wanted
[02:02:44.280 --> 02:02:46.280]  a connection, a family connection
[02:02:46.280 --> 02:02:48.280]  to Frank Marshall Davis
[02:02:48.280 --> 02:02:50.280]  who was known in a vowed communist
[02:02:50.280 --> 02:02:52.280]  so you know
[02:02:52.280 --> 02:02:54.280]  making this arrangement for
[02:02:54.280 --> 02:02:56.280]  Barack Obama senior
[02:02:56.280 --> 02:02:58.280]  to be named
[02:02:58.280 --> 02:03:00.280]  as the father
[02:03:00.280 --> 02:03:02.280]  it suddenly makes sense
[02:03:02.280 --> 02:03:04.280]  and also the fact that
[02:03:04.280 --> 02:03:06.280]  it's alleged that on the birth certificate
[02:03:06.280 --> 02:03:08.280]  it says
[02:03:08.280 --> 02:03:10.280]  father unknown
[02:03:10.280 --> 02:03:12.280]  which would also make sense
[02:03:12.280 --> 02:03:14.280]  wouldn't it
[02:03:14.280 --> 02:03:16.280]  I highly recommend that
[02:03:16.280 --> 02:03:18.280]  video and as a matter of fact
[02:03:18.280 --> 02:03:20.280]  Joel has given me
[02:03:20.280 --> 02:03:22.280]  some of those and I've been sending
[02:03:22.280 --> 02:03:24.280]  them out to people that aren't aware of it
[02:03:24.280 --> 02:03:26.280]  I think it's
[02:03:26.280 --> 02:03:28.280]  it's not hot the people should get the
[02:03:28.280 --> 02:03:30.280]  dreams of my real father
[02:03:30.280 --> 02:03:32.280]  that we have discounted at info warshop.com
[02:03:32.280 --> 02:03:34.280]  because I mean when I first was told
[02:03:34.280 --> 02:03:36.280]  2-3 months ago by Jerome Corsi
[02:03:36.280 --> 02:03:38.280]  it's not even officially out yet folks
[02:03:38.280 --> 02:03:40.280]  they gave it to us first, very nice to do that
[02:03:40.280 --> 02:03:42.280]  so we're selling it now, it's not even out until the 24th
[02:03:42.280 --> 02:03:44.280]  when I first heard this from Corsi
[02:03:44.280 --> 02:03:46.280]  because Corsi's like oh my gosh
[02:03:46.280 --> 02:03:48.280]  the whole thing, the reason they put out
[02:03:48.280 --> 02:03:50.280]  that he was born there, the reason his wife said
[02:03:50.280 --> 02:03:52.280]  he was born there, the reason that for 16 and a half years
[02:03:52.280 --> 02:03:54.280]  they said in his PR releases
[02:03:54.280 --> 02:03:56.280]  he was from Kenya
[02:03:56.280 --> 02:03:58.280]  and then
[02:03:58.280 --> 02:04:00.280]  we're like hey you said you were born in Kenya
[02:04:00.280 --> 02:04:02.280]  that was all the cover stories, he's really
[02:04:02.280 --> 02:04:04.280]  Frank Marshall Davis' sign
[02:04:04.280 --> 02:04:06.280]  I'm like yeah, let me see the film
[02:04:06.280 --> 02:04:08.280]  but I saw the film and it is chillingly
[02:04:08.280 --> 02:04:10.280]  convincing in my view
[02:04:10.280 --> 02:04:12.280]  my opinion is
[02:04:12.280 --> 02:04:14.280]  especially when you see the photograph
[02:04:14.280 --> 02:04:16.280]  side by side, I mean
[02:04:16.280 --> 02:04:18.280]  it's pretty obvious
[02:04:20.280 --> 02:04:22.280]  that there's more likelihood
[02:04:22.280 --> 02:04:24.280]  of a relationship
[02:04:24.280 --> 02:04:26.280]  between Frank Marshall Davis and Obama
[02:04:26.280 --> 02:04:28.280]  than there is the Barack Obama
[02:04:28.280 --> 02:04:30.280]  well there's the voice
[02:04:30.280 --> 02:04:32.280]  there's the same freckles
[02:04:32.280 --> 02:04:34.280]  you could tell when somebody's daddy
[02:04:34.280 --> 02:04:36.280]  yeah, absolutely
[02:04:36.280 --> 02:04:38.280]  and then there's the fact
[02:04:38.280 --> 02:04:40.280]  that he talks about him
[02:04:40.280 --> 02:04:42.280]  for thousands of words
[02:04:42.280 --> 02:04:44.280]  in his book
[02:04:44.280 --> 02:04:46.280]  and then there's the mother posing
[02:04:46.280 --> 02:04:48.280]  for the photos and it's the same couch
[02:04:48.280 --> 02:04:50.280]  very convincing, I tell ya
[02:04:50.280 --> 02:04:52.280]  folks, the film's available right now
[02:04:52.280 --> 02:04:54.280]  at www.shop.com
[02:04:54.280 --> 02:04:56.280]  you also support us and the filmmaker when you get it
[02:04:56.280 --> 02:04:58.280]  get a free citizen rule book with it
[02:04:58.280 --> 02:05:00.280]  we're gonna come right back and go to phone calls
[02:05:00.280 --> 02:05:02.280]  in a final segment with our guest
[02:05:02.280 --> 02:05:04.280]  this is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons
[02:05:04.280 --> 02:05:06.280]  you should consider buying a solar power generator
[02:05:06.280 --> 02:05:08.280]  number 1, new climate legislation
[02:05:08.280 --> 02:05:10.280]  could easily double or triple your electric bill
[02:05:10.280 --> 02:05:12.280]  number 2, our new energies are
[02:05:12.280 --> 02:05:14.280]  wants to control how much power
[02:05:14.280 --> 02:05:16.280]  your electric company allows you to have
[02:05:16.280 --> 02:05:18.280]  it's true, total government control
[02:05:18.280 --> 02:05:20.280]  of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:05:20.280 --> 02:05:22.280]  technology is coming
[02:05:22.280 --> 02:05:24.280]  number 3, in some areas of the country
[02:05:24.280 --> 02:05:26.280]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[02:05:26.280 --> 02:05:28.280]  and now, new socialist legislation
[02:05:28.280 --> 02:05:30.280]  is only compounding the problem
[02:05:30.280 --> 02:05:32.280]  number 4, dangerous weather is always
[02:05:32.280 --> 02:05:34.280]  a threat to local grids
[02:05:34.280 --> 02:05:36.280]  every year, thousands of families lose their power
[02:05:36.280 --> 02:05:38.280]  from weather-related onages
[02:05:38.280 --> 02:05:40.280]  number 5, a solar power generator provides
[02:05:40.280 --> 02:05:42.280]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[02:05:42.280 --> 02:05:44.280]  folks, I really believe in the solar power generators
[02:05:44.280 --> 02:05:46.280]  offered by Solutions from Science

[02:08:20.280 --> 02:08:24.280]  all right I want to hurry through phone calls with our guest
[02:08:24.280 --> 02:08:26.280]  Larry Grafwald
[02:08:26.280 --> 02:08:28.280]  if you just joined us
[02:08:28.280 --> 02:08:30.280]  he infiltrated the weathermen
[02:08:30.280 --> 02:08:32.280]  helped send him to prison
[02:08:32.280 --> 02:08:34.280]  they now basically run the White House
[02:08:34.280 --> 02:08:36.280]  for all intents and purposes
[02:08:36.280 --> 02:08:38.280]  and I want to go to your phone calls
[02:08:38.280 --> 02:08:40.280]  but what are some ways that they could try to take over
[02:08:40.280 --> 02:08:42.280]  because as far as I see
[02:08:42.280 --> 02:08:44.280]  Mitt Romney is not opposing him
[02:08:44.280 --> 02:08:46.280]  and they're out saying Mitt Romney is a felon
[02:08:46.280 --> 02:08:48.280]  and needs to be arrested
[02:08:48.280 --> 02:08:50.280]  and he's rolling around the ground
[02:08:50.280 --> 02:08:52.280]  saying please don't be mean to me
[02:08:52.280 --> 02:08:54.280]  he won't even go after him on Fast and Furious
[02:08:54.280 --> 02:08:56.280]  he wants Condi Rice
[02:08:56.280 --> 02:08:58.280]  Miss abortion in there
[02:08:58.280 --> 02:09:00.280]  I mean I don't see any opposition to Obama
[02:09:00.280 --> 02:09:02.280]  and right now it looks like I guess they may just put Obama back in
[02:09:02.280 --> 02:09:04.280]  what should we
[02:09:04.280 --> 02:09:06.280]  because I had Joseph Farron last week
[02:09:06.280 --> 02:09:08.280]  and he's back on next week
[02:09:08.280 --> 02:09:10.280]  and it made some national news
[02:09:10.280 --> 02:09:12.280]  when he said if Obama gets back in
[02:09:12.280 --> 02:09:14.280]  we're going to be hunted down like dogs
[02:09:14.280 --> 02:09:16.280]  and Farron wouldn't just say that if he didn't think that
[02:09:16.280 --> 02:09:18.280]  he was getting audited and had a drone over his rural house
[02:09:18.280 --> 02:09:20.280]  I get threats and stuff
[02:09:20.280 --> 02:09:22.280]  I don't want to give attention to it
[02:09:22.280 --> 02:09:24.280]  because I don't care
[02:09:24.280 --> 02:09:26.280]  but Larry you've been around these people
[02:09:26.280 --> 02:09:28.280]  could they stage a false flag event
[02:09:28.280 --> 02:09:30.280]  and blame it on domestic groups
[02:09:30.280 --> 02:09:32.280]  like Oklahoma City
[02:09:32.280 --> 02:09:34.280]  on patriot groups
[02:09:34.280 --> 02:09:36.280]  we know they did the last one
[02:09:36.280 --> 02:09:38.280]  from all the witnesses I've talked to
[02:09:38.280 --> 02:09:40.280]  what type of tricks do you think they could do
[02:09:40.280 --> 02:09:42.280]  or get us into a war
[02:09:42.280 --> 02:09:44.280]  I mean is Obama more dangerous
[02:09:44.280 --> 02:09:46.280]  before the election or after the election
[02:09:46.280 --> 02:09:48.280]  will they go quietly
[02:09:48.280 --> 02:09:50.280]  because I mean this is a bold group
[02:09:50.280 --> 02:09:52.280]  that's willing to blow up police stations
[02:09:52.280 --> 02:09:54.280]  and they're in control now
[02:09:54.280 --> 02:09:56.280]  so what can we expect him to try to do
[02:09:56.280 --> 02:09:58.280]  well I think
[02:09:58.280 --> 02:10:00.280]  you also have to consider the fact that
[02:10:00.280 --> 02:10:02.280]  Barack Obama
[02:10:02.280 --> 02:10:04.280]  has compared himself
[02:10:04.280 --> 02:10:06.280]  to the greatest presidents
[02:10:06.280 --> 02:10:08.280]  in our history including Abraham Lincoln
[02:10:08.280 --> 02:10:10.280]  so this guy's
[02:10:10.280 --> 02:10:12.280]  image of himself and his ego
[02:10:12.280 --> 02:10:14.280]  is quite large
[02:10:14.280 --> 02:10:16.280]  and I suspect that if
[02:10:16.280 --> 02:10:18.280]  by chance
[02:10:18.280 --> 02:10:20.280]  Mitt Romney does manage to win the election
[02:10:20.280 --> 02:10:22.280]  that there's a real possibility
[02:10:22.280 --> 02:10:24.280]  that our president
[02:10:24.280 --> 02:10:26.280]  will come up with some kind of
[02:10:26.280 --> 02:10:28.280]  emergency
[02:10:28.280 --> 02:10:30.280]  that requires the declaration
[02:10:30.280 --> 02:10:32.280]  of martial law
[02:10:32.280 --> 02:10:34.280]  and the negation of the election results
[02:10:34.280 --> 02:10:36.280]  and I realize
[02:10:36.280 --> 02:10:38.280]  that that may sound absurd to some people
[02:10:38.280 --> 02:10:40.280]  but you've got to
[02:10:40.280 --> 02:10:42.280]  measure
[02:10:42.280 --> 02:10:44.280]  his associations and his ego
[02:10:44.280 --> 02:10:46.280]  with what the possibilities are
[02:10:46.280 --> 02:10:48.280]  and I don't think that they're willing
[02:10:48.280 --> 02:10:50.280]  to give up the power that they have
[02:10:50.280 --> 02:10:52.280]  willingly
[02:10:52.280 --> 02:10:54.280]  I also believe
[02:10:54.280 --> 02:10:56.280]  that you could be right
[02:10:56.280 --> 02:10:58.280]  at any kind of
[02:10:58.280 --> 02:11:00.280]  events that
[02:11:00.280 --> 02:11:02.280]  justify martial law again
[02:11:02.280 --> 02:11:04.280]  will allow these camps that have been built
[02:11:04.280 --> 02:11:06.280]  in these prisons
[02:11:06.280 --> 02:11:08.280]  to come into use
[02:11:08.280 --> 02:11:10.280]  I saw a program on TV
[02:11:10.280 --> 02:11:12.280]  not long ago
[02:11:12.280 --> 02:11:14.280]  that was showing a prison
[02:11:14.280 --> 02:11:16.280]  that had been built
[02:11:16.280 --> 02:11:18.280]  I believe it was in Nebraska
[02:11:18.280 --> 02:11:20.280]  that was totally empty
[02:11:20.280 --> 02:11:22.280]  this was a prison built by the federal government
[02:11:22.280 --> 02:11:24.280]  state of the art
[02:11:24.280 --> 02:11:26.280]  and nothing's there
[02:11:26.280 --> 02:11:28.280]  the community's kind of disappointed
[02:11:28.280 --> 02:11:30.280]  because they expected a boost to the economy
[02:11:30.280 --> 02:11:32.280]  oh yeah we've got one up here
[02:11:32.280 --> 02:11:34.280]  in Taylor with nobody in it
[02:11:34.280 --> 02:11:36.280]  see that's what's incredible about this
[02:11:36.280 --> 02:11:38.280]  is everything they plan
[02:11:38.280 --> 02:11:40.280]  back in college with their PhDs
[02:11:40.280 --> 02:11:42.280]  they're now in control
[02:11:42.280 --> 02:11:44.280]  and again
[02:11:44.280 --> 02:11:46.280]  people don't think you're overstating it
[02:11:46.280 --> 02:11:48.280]  everybody in their gut can feel it
[02:11:48.280 --> 02:11:50.280]  that's why 2, 3, 4, 5 million guns
[02:11:50.280 --> 02:11:52.280]  a month are being sold
[02:11:52.280 --> 02:11:54.280]  in surveys, national surveys, they say
[02:11:54.280 --> 02:11:56.280]  why are you buying guns? we don't trust the government
[02:11:56.280 --> 02:11:58.280]  and I want to
[02:11:58.280 --> 02:12:00.280]  warn the communists and their banker
[02:12:00.280 --> 02:12:02.280]  financiers you're not going to get away with this
[02:12:02.280 --> 02:12:04.280]  I want to get people a news flash
[02:12:04.280 --> 02:12:06.280]  I mean Larry's a combat
[02:12:06.280 --> 02:12:08.280]  a veteran, a psychologist now
[02:12:08.280 --> 02:12:10.280]  he's analyzing
[02:12:10.280 --> 02:12:12.280]  the megalomania of these people
[02:12:12.280 --> 02:12:14.280]  we were talking during the break about
[02:12:14.280 --> 02:12:16.280]  my gosh we may be lined up against the same wall
[02:12:16.280 --> 02:12:18.280]  but obviously we're not just going to sit here
[02:12:18.280 --> 02:12:20.280]  and be lined up against a wall
[02:12:20.280 --> 02:12:22.280]  absolutely
[02:12:22.280 --> 02:12:24.280]  they may get me
[02:12:24.280 --> 02:12:26.280]  but it's going to be an all day job
[02:12:26.280 --> 02:12:28.280]  so they better bring a lunch
[02:12:30.280 --> 02:12:32.280]  and I hope that other people
[02:12:32.280 --> 02:12:34.280]  feel the same way and it's time
[02:12:34.280 --> 02:12:36.280]  for the
[02:12:36.280 --> 02:12:38.280]  so-called violent majority to wake up
[02:12:38.280 --> 02:12:40.280]  and start to take
[02:12:40.280 --> 02:12:42.280]  our country back
[02:12:42.280 --> 02:12:44.280]  this move towards
[02:12:44.280 --> 02:12:46.280]  world government and allowing
[02:12:46.280 --> 02:12:48.280]  our country to come under the control of the
[02:12:48.280 --> 02:12:50.280]  UN is very real
[02:12:50.280 --> 02:12:52.280]  of this
[02:12:52.280 --> 02:12:54.280]  law of the seas treaty
[02:12:54.280 --> 02:12:56.280]  that basically is going
[02:12:56.280 --> 02:12:58.280]  to take away our right to govern
[02:12:58.280 --> 02:13:00.280]  our own international waters
[02:13:00.280 --> 02:13:02.280]  or our coastal waters
[02:13:02.280 --> 02:13:04.280]  it's just a third
[02:13:04.280 --> 02:13:06.280]  did you see the CNBC
[02:13:06.280 --> 02:13:08.280]  where they came out and said we're slaves
[02:13:08.280 --> 02:13:10.280]  to world government now and all this?
[02:13:10.280 --> 02:13:12.280]  yeah and they believe that
[02:13:12.280 --> 02:13:14.280]  well and they're, you know, look at this
[02:13:14.280 --> 02:13:16.280]  they're going to have this
[02:13:16.280 --> 02:13:18.280]  the UN meeting about
[02:13:18.280 --> 02:13:20.280]  weapons they call it small arms treaty
[02:13:20.280 --> 02:13:22.280]  and they put
[02:13:22.280 --> 02:13:24.280]  Iran in it
[02:13:24.280 --> 02:13:26.280]  and they admit that they're going to register all the guns
[02:13:26.280 --> 02:13:28.280]  under the treaty under UN
[02:13:28.280 --> 02:13:30.280]  orders it's insane
[02:13:30.280 --> 02:13:32.280]  well that's the way to get around
[02:13:32.280 --> 02:13:34.280]  our constitution
[02:13:34.280 --> 02:13:36.280]  by saying now we're obliged
[02:13:36.280 --> 02:13:38.280]  to do this because of the
[02:13:38.280 --> 02:13:40.280]  treaty with the UN
[02:13:40.280 --> 02:13:42.280]  but Larry doesn't this feel like a dream
[02:13:42.280 --> 02:13:44.280]  that it's, that it's
[02:13:44.280 --> 02:13:46.280]  we've got a guy who grew up and hangs out with a weatherman
[02:13:46.280 --> 02:13:48.280]  we've got socialist
[02:13:48.280 --> 02:13:50.280]  healthcare
[02:13:52.280 --> 02:13:54.280]  exactly I mean I'm just saying it doesn't
[02:13:54.280 --> 02:13:56.280]  feel real
[02:13:56.280 --> 02:13:58.280]  and it's
[02:13:58.280 --> 02:14:00.280]  and we're just waiting for the other shoe to drop here
[02:14:00.280 --> 02:14:02.280]  I mean
[02:14:02.280 --> 02:14:04.280]  if you would have asked me this question
[02:14:04.280 --> 02:14:06.280]  20 years ago
[02:14:06.280 --> 02:14:08.280]  I would have left
[02:14:08.280 --> 02:14:10.280]  and yet here he is
[02:14:10.280 --> 02:14:12.280]  I mean Barack Obama is not only friends
[02:14:12.280 --> 02:14:14.280]  with Bernadine Dorn and Bill Ayers
[02:14:14.280 --> 02:14:16.280]  who are admitted domestic terrorists
[02:14:16.280 --> 02:14:18.280]  but Jeff Jones
[02:14:18.280 --> 02:14:20.280]  is part of
[02:14:20.280 --> 02:14:22.280]  Lord I can't remember
[02:14:22.280 --> 02:14:24.280]  which group it is but he's been an advisor
[02:14:24.280 --> 02:14:26.280]  on
[02:14:26.280 --> 02:14:28.280]  the economic stimulus
[02:14:28.280 --> 02:14:30.280]  and the Obamacare
[02:14:30.280 --> 02:14:32.280]  well sure now they're putting al-Qaeda
[02:14:32.280 --> 02:14:34.280]  in charge as well
[02:14:34.280 --> 02:14:36.280]  in Libya and Syria
[02:14:36.280 --> 02:14:38.280]  I'm no fan of Assad or Qaddafi but
[02:14:38.280 --> 02:14:40.280]  these groups are five times worse
[02:14:40.280 --> 02:14:42.280]  yes the Muslim Brotherhood
[02:14:42.280 --> 02:14:44.280]  is now in
[02:14:44.280 --> 02:14:46.280]  charge of Egypt and
[02:14:46.280 --> 02:14:48.280]  we're supposed to think that that's a better thing
[02:14:48.280 --> 02:14:50.280]  and make no mistake
[02:14:50.280 --> 02:14:52.280]  if they can destroy Israel
[02:14:52.280 --> 02:14:54.280]  they will
[02:14:54.280 --> 02:14:56.280]  that just goes
[02:14:56.280 --> 02:14:58.280]  without saying if you give Iran
[02:14:58.280 --> 02:15:00.280]  the bomb Israel is gone
[02:15:00.280 --> 02:15:02.280]  and
[02:15:02.280 --> 02:15:04.280]  I mean
[02:15:04.280 --> 02:15:06.280]  forget any threat on the United States
[02:15:06.280 --> 02:15:08.280]  which if they get a missile
[02:15:08.280 --> 02:15:10.280]  that will recharge yours
[02:15:10.280 --> 02:15:12.280]  they'll use it on us too
[02:15:12.280 --> 02:15:14.280]  well it's just crazy that I'm told
[02:15:14.280 --> 02:15:16.280]  give up all my rights because of al-Qaeda
[02:15:16.280 --> 02:15:18.280]  and then there they are putting them in charge in countries
[02:15:18.280 --> 02:15:20.280]  I'm gonna have to keep you to the bottom of the hour
[02:15:20.280 --> 02:15:22.280]  that's coming up but we've got to go to calls right now
[02:15:22.280 --> 02:15:24.280]  tell folks about the conference
[02:15:24.280 --> 02:15:26.280]  you've got coming up
[02:15:26.280 --> 02:15:28.280]  well it's next Thursday
[02:15:28.280 --> 02:15:30.280]  that's July the 19th
[02:15:30.280 --> 02:15:32.280]  at the National Press Club in Washington DC
[02:15:32.280 --> 02:15:34.280]  it's sponsored
[02:15:34.280 --> 02:15:36.280]  by
[02:15:36.280 --> 02:15:38.280]  come on
[02:15:38.280 --> 02:15:40.280]  Cliff Kincaid
[02:15:40.280 --> 02:15:42.280]  and America's Survival
[02:15:42.280 --> 02:15:44.280]  and it's
[02:15:44.280 --> 02:15:46.280]  essentially titled the vetting of Obama
[02:15:46.280 --> 02:15:48.280]  radical
[02:15:48.280 --> 02:15:50.280]  Islam and the forest connection
[02:15:50.280 --> 02:15:52.280]  and what
[02:15:52.280 --> 02:15:54.280]  we're going to do is
[02:15:54.280 --> 02:15:56.280]  hopefully vet Obama
[02:15:56.280 --> 02:15:58.280]  which of course the mainstream
[02:15:58.280 --> 02:16:00.280]  media has not even
[02:16:00.280 --> 02:16:02.280]  attempted to do
[02:16:02.280 --> 02:16:04.280]  people
[02:16:04.280 --> 02:16:06.280]  Joel Gilbert
[02:16:06.280 --> 02:16:08.280]  going to be there
[02:16:08.280 --> 02:16:10.280]  the person who produced the
[02:16:10.280 --> 02:16:12.280]  video that we were talking about
[02:16:12.280 --> 02:16:14.280]  the dreams of my real father
[02:16:14.280 --> 02:16:16.280]  everybody
[02:16:16.280 --> 02:16:18.280]  needs to go to that
[02:16:18.280 --> 02:16:20.280]  and say hi to Cliff Kincaid
[02:16:20.280 --> 02:16:22.280]  I want to get him back on the show
[02:16:22.280 --> 02:16:24.280]  but I go on Japanese, British TV
[02:16:24.280 --> 02:16:26.280]  national US TV
[02:16:26.280 --> 02:16:28.280]  CNBC
[02:16:28.280 --> 02:16:30.280]  and I've been on Russian today
[02:16:30.280 --> 02:16:32.280]  because I can do it on Skype
[02:16:32.280 --> 02:16:34.280]  and he put an article out saying
[02:16:34.280 --> 02:16:36.280]  I think Jones is a dupe of the Kremlin now
[02:16:36.280 --> 02:16:38.280]  because he's criticizing all these new wars
[02:16:38.280 --> 02:16:40.280]  just because I don't want our country to go bankrupt
[02:16:40.280 --> 02:16:42.280]  I mean Kincaid's a good guy
[02:16:42.280 --> 02:16:44.280]  he cares about the country
[02:16:44.280 --> 02:16:46.280]  it's so funny
[02:16:46.280 --> 02:16:48.280]  Joel Gilbert great guy we're carrying his film
[02:16:48.280 --> 02:16:50.280]  let's go to some calls quickly here
[02:16:50.280 --> 02:16:52.280]  we'll go to Elaine
[02:16:52.280 --> 02:16:54.280]  then we'll go to Matt and others
[02:16:54.280 --> 02:16:56.280]  Julio there in Illinois as well
[02:16:56.280 --> 02:16:58.280]  Elaine you're on the air with our guest
[02:16:58.280 --> 02:17:00.280]  go ahead
[02:17:00.280 --> 02:17:02.280]  I'm honored
[02:17:02.280 --> 02:17:04.280]  truly honored to be with two of my greatest
[02:17:04.280 --> 02:17:06.280]  heroes
[02:17:06.280 --> 02:17:08.280]  this is wonderful
[02:17:10.280 --> 02:17:12.280]  now I'll ask my question
[02:17:12.280 --> 02:17:14.280]  is there any credible legal evidence
[02:17:14.280 --> 02:17:16.280]  against Bill Ayers
[02:17:16.280 --> 02:17:18.280]  Bernardine etc etc
[02:17:18.280 --> 02:17:20.280]  why aren't they all
[02:17:20.280 --> 02:17:22.280]  in the FEMA camp right now
[02:17:22.280 --> 02:17:24.280]  is it our legal system
[02:17:24.280 --> 02:17:26.280]  that infiltrated
[02:17:26.280 --> 02:17:28.280]  or intimidated
[02:17:28.280 --> 02:17:30.280]  I'll hang up and get my answer
[02:17:30.280 --> 02:17:32.280]  that's a good question
[02:17:32.280 --> 02:17:34.280]  Larry when the police get these new manuals
[02:17:34.280 --> 02:17:36.280]  saying the founders are bad
[02:17:36.280 --> 02:17:38.280]  and returning vets are terrorist
[02:17:38.280 --> 02:17:40.280]  and gun owners are evil
[02:17:40.280 --> 02:17:42.280]  and I've talked to police
[02:17:42.280 --> 02:17:44.280]  I think that's finally waking them up
[02:17:44.280 --> 02:17:46.280]  yes I do too
[02:17:46.280 --> 02:17:48.280]  you know especially the
[02:17:48.280 --> 02:17:50.280]  people who believe in the Constitution
[02:17:50.280 --> 02:17:52.280]  and the Declaration of Independence
[02:17:52.280 --> 02:17:54.280]  the reason that the weathermen
[02:17:54.280 --> 02:17:56.280]  were not prosecuted was on a legal
[02:17:56.280 --> 02:17:58.280]  technicality
[02:17:58.280 --> 02:18:00.280]  the evidence was thrown out
[02:18:00.280 --> 02:18:02.280]  because according
[02:18:02.280 --> 02:18:04.280]  to the courts it was obtained illegally
[02:18:04.280 --> 02:18:06.280]  and as a matter of fact
[02:18:06.280 --> 02:18:08.280]  two FBI agents
[02:18:08.280 --> 02:18:10.280]  Miller
[02:18:10.280 --> 02:18:12.280]  and
[02:18:12.280 --> 02:18:14.280]  Lord I forget his name deep throat
[02:18:14.280 --> 02:18:16.280]  what was his name
[02:18:16.280 --> 02:18:18.280]  come on
[02:18:18.280 --> 02:18:20.280]  it doesn't matter it's on record
[02:18:20.280 --> 02:18:22.280]  well anyway they were prosecuted
[02:18:22.280 --> 02:18:24.280]  and convicted I testified
[02:18:24.280 --> 02:18:26.280]  at their trial for the defense
[02:18:26.280 --> 02:18:28.280]  Mark Felt
[02:18:28.280 --> 02:18:30.280]  Mark Felt and Ed Miller
[02:18:30.280 --> 02:18:32.280]  two FBI agents
[02:18:32.280 --> 02:18:34.280]  supervisors
[02:18:34.280 --> 02:18:36.280]  you talk about an irony the weathermen
[02:18:36.280 --> 02:18:38.280]  walked free and the
[02:18:38.280 --> 02:18:40.280]  agents that were protecting
[02:18:40.280 --> 02:18:42.280]  our country were
[02:18:42.280 --> 02:18:44.280]  prosecuted and convicted
[02:18:44.280 --> 02:18:46.280]  Ronald Reagan pardoned them
[02:18:46.280 --> 02:18:48.280]  but exactly
[02:18:48.280 --> 02:18:50.280]  again you can kill police
[02:18:50.280 --> 02:18:52.280]  and you don't get in trouble
[02:18:52.280 --> 02:18:54.280]  again these communists are backed
[02:18:54.280 --> 02:18:56.280]  by powerful people is my point
[02:18:56.280 --> 02:18:58.280]  oh yes absolutely
[02:18:58.280 --> 02:19:00.280]  and
[02:19:00.280 --> 02:19:02.280]  right now because
[02:19:02.280 --> 02:19:04.280]  we haven't really
[02:19:04.280 --> 02:19:06.280]  fought
[02:19:06.280 --> 02:19:08.280]  against them
[02:19:08.280 --> 02:19:10.280]  they're succeeding
[02:19:10.280 --> 02:19:12.280]  I think the vast majority
[02:19:12.280 --> 02:19:14.280]  of Americans are patriots
[02:19:14.280 --> 02:19:16.280]  and if they wake up to what's happening
[02:19:16.280 --> 02:19:18.280]  I think it will
[02:19:18.280 --> 02:19:20.280]  I think Fast and Furious has almost done that
[02:19:20.280 --> 02:19:22.280]  we're going to break in 40 seconds but
[02:19:22.280 --> 02:19:24.280]  Matt in California what's your question
[02:19:24.280 --> 02:19:26.280]  we'll come back and answer it Matt go ahead
[02:19:26.280 --> 02:19:28.280]  hey Alec Larry
[02:19:28.280 --> 02:19:30.280]  yeah
[02:19:30.280 --> 02:19:32.280]  wasn't Andrew Breitbart
[02:19:32.280 --> 02:19:34.280]  going to be putting out some
[02:19:34.280 --> 02:19:36.280]  wasn't he going to put on video
[02:19:36.280 --> 02:19:38.280]  with Obama and Bill Ayers together
[02:19:38.280 --> 02:19:40.280]  doesn't that why
[02:19:40.280 --> 02:19:42.280]  he was um um
[02:19:42.280 --> 02:19:44.280]  suicided
[02:19:44.280 --> 02:19:46.280]  he said he met with Ayers which was crazy
[02:19:46.280 --> 02:19:48.280]  uh rested peace and that
[02:19:48.280 --> 02:19:50.280]  he was going to break this big news he knows it never really came out
[02:19:50.280 --> 02:19:52.280]  I mean that I mean that was clearly
[02:19:52.280 --> 02:19:54.280]  well we're going to get Mr. Graphwall's
[02:19:54.280 --> 02:19:56.280]  take on that on the other side one more little
[02:19:56.280 --> 02:19:58.280]  segment a few more calls straight ahead
[02:19:58.280 --> 02:20:00.280]  I'm Alex Jones of info wars
[02:20:00.280 --> 02:20:02.280]  dot com
[02:20:04.280 --> 02:20:06.280]  folks have you lost your power
[02:20:06.280 --> 02:20:08.280]  and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on
[02:20:08.280 --> 02:20:10.280]  if so this is going to be
[02:20:10.280 --> 02:20:12.280]  the most important message you'll ever hear
[02:20:12.280 --> 02:20:14.280]  because there's never been a better time
[02:20:14.280 --> 02:20:16.280]  to get ready for the winter power out of just ahead
[02:20:16.280 --> 02:20:18.280]  here's why solar power
[02:20:18.280 --> 02:20:20.280]  generators are now available
[02:20:20.280 --> 02:20:22.280]  from our friends at solutions from science

[02:20:28.280 --> 02:20:30.280]  unlike gas generators
[02:20:30.280 --> 02:20:32.280]  a solar generator runs quietly
[02:20:32.280 --> 02:20:34.280]  amidst no fumes and produces electricity
[02:20:34.280 --> 02:20:36.280]  from the sun it's like having an electric
[02:20:36.280 --> 02:20:38.280]  power plant running quietly in your own
[02:20:38.280 --> 02:20:40.280]  own whether it's ice storms
[02:20:40.280 --> 02:20:42.280]  brownouts or blackouts you'll never have to
[02:20:42.280 --> 02:20:44.280]  suffer through painful power outages again
[02:20:44.280 --> 02:20:46.280]  when the power goes out this winter
[02:20:46.280 --> 02:20:48.280]  you'll be ready with a solar power
[02:20:48.280 --> 02:20:50.280]  generator from solutions from science

[02:24:30.280 --> 02:24:32.280]  there?
[02:24:32.280 --> 02:24:34.280]  ironically
[02:24:34.280 --> 02:24:36.280]  I talked to Andrew Breitbart
[02:24:36.280 --> 02:24:38.280]  the night he went to
[02:24:38.280 --> 02:24:40.280]  that dinner
[02:24:40.280 --> 02:24:42.280]  party with
[02:24:42.280 --> 02:24:44.280]  Bernadine Dorn
[02:24:44.280 --> 02:24:46.280]  he called me to get information
[02:24:46.280 --> 02:24:48.280]  about the two characters
[02:24:48.280 --> 02:24:50.280]  during that conversation
[02:24:50.280 --> 02:24:52.280]  he told me
[02:24:52.280 --> 02:25:00.360]  that he was creating a documentary and that he was going to be getting back in touch with
[02:25:00.360 --> 02:25:01.360]  me.
[02:25:01.360 --> 02:25:07.960]  Now, I've talked to some people who are associates of Breitbart, and they assure me that his death
[02:25:07.960 --> 02:25:11.320]  was not a murder.
[02:25:11.320 --> 02:25:19.560]  He did die of natural causes, but I, too, am suspicious because after he makes the statement
[02:25:19.560 --> 02:25:24.440]  that he's going to release all of this information, he died.
[02:25:24.440 --> 02:25:26.960]  What about a week later or two weeks later?
[02:25:26.960 --> 02:25:28.480]  By the way, we just showed a photo.
[02:25:28.480 --> 02:25:33.280]  It's Tucker Carlson and the reporter that confronted me at Bilderberg with him at the
[02:25:33.280 --> 02:25:34.280]  party.
[02:25:34.280 --> 02:25:35.280]  Very interesting.
[02:25:35.280 --> 02:25:36.280]  Tucker Carlson.
[02:25:36.280 --> 02:25:39.400]  Let's go to a caller here real quick.
[02:25:39.400 --> 02:25:40.400]  Eric in Mississippi.
[02:25:40.400 --> 02:25:41.400]  Thanks for holding.
[02:25:41.400 --> 02:25:42.400]  You're on the air with our guest.
[02:25:42.400 --> 02:25:43.400]  Go ahead.
[02:25:43.400 --> 02:25:52.720]  Hello. My question is to Mr. Larry, being here in Mississippi, I was looking months
[02:25:52.720 --> 02:26:01.240]  ago at all the new militia movement over the last few years, and I was wondering, what
[02:26:01.240 --> 02:26:12.360]  are your thoughts on how infiltrated are all these things, and second, after the UN gun
[02:26:12.360 --> 02:26:18.520]  ban and all, if they go for a rollout in the rural areas, what do you think they'll opt
[02:26:18.520 --> 02:26:21.880]  for, just a bankrupt and starved out or?
[02:26:21.880 --> 02:26:23.760]  I think it's a bankrupt, starved out.
[02:26:23.760 --> 02:26:26.600]  That's always the communist model, and that's what they're setting up for.
[02:26:26.600 --> 02:26:27.600]  Larry, comments on that.
[02:26:27.600 --> 02:26:28.600]  I agree.
[02:26:28.600 --> 02:26:38.000]  There's possibilities that individuals and groups will be signaled out, and there'll
[02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:43.560]  be some kind of violent confrontation, but for the most part, I think it'll be isolation
[02:26:43.560 --> 02:26:50.600]  and bankrupt them, discredit them and use IRS on it and things like that.
[02:26:50.600 --> 02:26:52.440]  Four stage events and blame it on us.
[02:26:52.440 --> 02:26:54.120]  Let's go to Julio in Illinois.
[02:26:54.120 --> 02:26:56.120]  You're on the air with our guest, Larry Grafwall.
[02:26:56.120 --> 02:26:57.120]  Go ahead.
[02:26:57.120 --> 02:27:02.320]  I think Chicago is primed for a false flag attack.
[02:27:02.320 --> 02:27:06.920]  I remember the story came out in September, but with fast and furious, there's a little
[02:27:06.920 --> 02:27:15.240]  sting out in Indiana, where the ATF allowed a gun shop in Indiana to let guns be purchased
[02:27:15.240 --> 02:27:20.920]  by gang members, and it was then shifted into Chicago and given to the Chicago gangs, and
[02:27:20.920 --> 02:27:21.920]  then the reason I bring this up is-
[02:27:21.920 --> 02:27:22.920]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:27:22.920 --> 02:27:25.120]  The fast and furious is arming gangs all over the country.
[02:27:25.120 --> 02:27:26.120]  Yes.
[02:27:26.120 --> 02:27:31.000]  And the reason I bring this up is because the Sugar Daddy, Rahm Emanuel, we all know former
[02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:36.000]  Chief of Staff of Obama, they're going to set up, obviously, this militarized police
[02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:41.120]  state zone in the city, so I wanted to ask your guest, his thoughts on maybe Chicago
[02:27:41.120 --> 02:27:46.480]  being it, because I think from a psychological and sociological perspective, if they have
[02:27:46.480 --> 02:27:51.640]  a false flag in Chicago, it's quote unquote, Bailey Cittoro, Obama's hometown happening
[02:27:51.640 --> 02:27:52.640]  under-
[02:27:52.640 --> 02:27:53.640]  Sure, so they can-
[02:27:53.640 --> 02:27:54.640]  Rahm Emanuel.
[02:27:54.640 --> 02:27:56.880]  Yes, they can grandstand his saviors there.
[02:27:56.880 --> 02:27:58.040]  A good question.
[02:27:58.040 --> 02:28:01.320]  What do you think of Emanuel and the Chicago Mafia?
[02:28:01.320 --> 02:28:07.520]  Oh, well, I mean, we all know about Chicago politics, and it's been that way, pardon me,
[02:28:07.520 --> 02:28:15.920]  for decades, and as far as Chicago being the epicenter, I think it'll depend upon, you
[02:28:15.920 --> 02:28:20.480]  know, what events transpire in other locations in the country.
[02:28:20.480 --> 02:28:26.000]  They're going to use events to their benefit, but who was it, Rahm Emanuel?
[02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:27.920]  Don't let a good crisis go to waste.
[02:28:27.920 --> 02:28:28.920]  That's right.
[02:28:28.920 --> 02:28:29.920]  That's right.
[02:28:29.920 --> 02:28:30.920]  I want to ask you a question.
[02:28:30.920 --> 02:28:34.560]  Or to repeat what you said as a psychologist, as a combat veteran, you know, with a lot
[02:28:34.560 --> 02:28:38.320]  of life skills, street skills as well, in the minute we have left Larry, we were talking
[02:28:38.320 --> 02:28:41.480]  during the break, and so-called liberals, because so-called conservatives have their
[02:28:41.480 --> 02:28:46.880]  problems too, but when you watch MSNBC or you read their books, all they do is talk
[02:28:46.880 --> 02:28:52.400]  about how smart they are and how dumb everyone else is, and I mean, are they not on average
[02:28:52.400 --> 02:28:56.400]  typecasting them, egomaniac power trippers?
[02:28:56.400 --> 02:28:57.880]  They're not even really liberals.
[02:28:57.880 --> 02:29:07.320]  Yeah, I couldn't agree more, and I think the absolute epitome of that was Chris Matthews
[02:29:07.320 --> 02:29:13.240]  after the election making that comment about when Barack Obama speaks, he gets a tingle
[02:29:13.240 --> 02:29:19.680]  up his leg, and I wonder if he realized how stupid that sounded, but of course in his
[02:29:19.680 --> 02:29:24.920]  arrogance, he thinks that he's one of the smartest people in the country.
[02:29:24.920 --> 02:29:28.520]  That's like a mutual admiration society.
[02:29:28.520 --> 02:29:33.720]  Yes, self-mutual admiration, I agree.
[02:29:33.720 --> 02:29:35.520]  Larry, let me say bye to you during the break.
[02:29:35.520 --> 02:29:39.400]  We're going to come back with shooter Jennings Song that he gave us to use in our police
[02:29:39.400 --> 02:29:45.360]  state four film, The Summer of Rage, that's of course Will and Jennings' son, and then
[02:29:45.360 --> 02:29:48.920]  we're going to go to more of your calls and a bunch of news straight ahead.
[02:29:48.920 --> 02:29:51.280]  Larry, let me say bye to you during the break here.
[02:29:51.280 --> 02:29:58.280]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:21.280 --> 02:30:28.280]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:28.280 --> 02:30:57.280]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:57.280 --> 02:31:01.280]  So call to order 888-253-3139.
[02:31:01.280 --> 02:31:03.040]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:31:03.040 --> 02:31:07.000]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage
[02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:08.640]  vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:31:08.640 --> 02:31:12.680]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver
[02:31:12.680 --> 02:31:13.680]  or gold?
[02:31:13.680 --> 02:31:16.960]  It's true, seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country, and
[02:31:16.960 --> 02:31:19.200]  it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:31:19.200 --> 02:31:23.680]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[02:31:23.680 --> 02:31:24.680]  seeds.
[02:31:24.680 --> 02:31:29.440]  You can call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient
[02:31:29.440 --> 02:31:31.560]  dense food for you and your family.
[02:31:31.560 --> 02:31:35.280]  And here's the best part, these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way,
[02:31:35.280 --> 02:31:39.360]  and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:31:39.360 --> 02:31:42.600]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:31:42.600 --> 02:31:49.400]  That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:31:49.400 --> 02:31:53.520]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:31:53.520 --> 02:32:06.520]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system
[02:32:06.520 --> 02:32:11.240]  with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function
[02:32:11.240 --> 02:32:15.080]  of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions
[02:32:15.080 --> 02:32:17.760]  anywhere in or on the body.
[02:32:17.760 --> 02:32:22.560]  My name is Mario Safaldi, and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:32:22.560 --> 02:32:27.160]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions,
[02:32:27.160 --> 02:32:31.800]  it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver
[02:32:31.800 --> 02:32:35.320]  solutions directly to key target areas.
[02:32:35.320 --> 02:32:42.080]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive
[02:32:42.080 --> 02:32:43.080]  system.
[02:32:43.080 --> 02:32:50.480]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.silverlungs.com
[02:32:50.480 --> 02:32:53.560]  to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[02:32:53.560 --> 02:33:08.040]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[02:33:08.040 --> 02:33:31.120]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.

[02:39:13.920 --> 02:39:19.480]  were anti-government. It was an attempt to open up, not like a war on drugs, but like
[02:39:19.480 --> 02:39:25.600]  a war on patriots, so yes, they picked a group that they could demonize.
[02:39:25.600 --> 02:39:32.840]  And the process wound up killing a good number of people. The tactical application of what
[02:39:32.840 --> 02:39:39.880]  they did had certain predictability, in my opinion, and that was that the branched
[02:39:39.880 --> 02:39:46.600]  dividends were going to resist and that there was a very good likelihood that a lot of them
[02:39:46.600 --> 02:39:51.400]  were going to die. How long would it have been taken to sit there and wait for them
[02:39:51.400 --> 02:39:56.400]  people to eventually come out peacefully? Well, Koresh went into town every day. They
[02:39:56.400 --> 02:40:02.000]  had multiple businesses. He jogged off the property every morning. Yes, I mean, it just
[02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:08.200]  doesn't make any sense. It wasn't necessary. Well, we got the ATF documents where they
[02:40:08.200 --> 02:40:12.920]  wanted to get, they were about to get their agency cut or their funding cut, and so they
[02:40:12.920 --> 02:40:17.440]  wanted a big PR stunt. And that's what you're talking about when
[02:40:17.440 --> 02:40:24.720]  you say that there's vested interest. There's certain organizations, including law enforcement,
[02:40:24.720 --> 02:40:30.200]  that are so intent upon making a name for themselves that they forgive what their real
[02:40:30.200 --> 02:40:38.160]  purpose is. And they ride around in cars that's safe to protect and serve. Well, what about
[02:40:38.160 --> 02:40:46.200]  protection? That has to be the focus and burning that place down or the activities that resulted
[02:40:46.200 --> 02:40:52.440]  in the place burning down were predictable. And why didn't the FBI and the government
[02:40:52.440 --> 02:40:58.480]  agencies just sit there and wait? That would have been the smart thing to do.
[02:40:58.480 --> 02:41:02.200]  But they wanted to start a war against the cults, which they were going to segue into
[02:41:02.200 --> 02:41:07.040]  conservatives returning veterans. I mean, that was the plan and it failed. And that's
[02:41:07.040 --> 02:41:11.480]  what really started the current big Liberty movement was Waco. Oklahoma City was the White
[02:41:11.480 --> 02:41:15.760]  House answer to that. Now that's out in the open that that was a staged event. Larry,
[02:41:15.760 --> 02:41:17.480]  thank you so much for the time. Look forward to having you back.
[02:41:17.480 --> 02:41:21.560]  Thank you for having me and I'll be willing to come back anytime. You have a good day
[02:41:21.560 --> 02:41:25.600]  and thanks again. Thank you. Say hi to a Kincaid for me.
[02:41:25.600 --> 02:41:27.440]  I will. All right. There he goes, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:41:27.440 --> 02:41:32.000]  I meant to go an hour with that gentleman. That was a riveting interview. What a real
[02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:38.720]  guy right there and saved a lot of lives helping bring down most scum, even if Bill Clinton
[02:41:38.720 --> 02:41:45.000]  let him out of prison. But it's just, it's just amazing that I've had cops literally
[02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:50.720]  more than 50 times and FBI and informants. I'll be signing DVDs at a film showing and
[02:41:50.720 --> 02:41:55.200]  they walk over and go, hey, you want to blow up some buildings and you look at them and
[02:41:55.200 --> 02:42:00.440]  it's like an informant or a cop. He's going, man, come on, you idiot. And you know, the
[02:42:00.440 --> 02:42:08.200]  next step of that is framing us. And that's what's so frustrating. I'm the last person
[02:42:08.200 --> 02:42:13.520]  that wants a shooting war with the government, but if the government is communist, globalist
[02:42:13.520 --> 02:42:19.360]  run and tries to take this country over, there's no alternative but to resist it. And that's
[02:42:19.360 --> 02:42:24.480]  why I want to warn the police and military. Now they plan on destroying you in this civil
[02:42:24.480 --> 02:42:30.120]  war and us in the process because they see us as the same people. They hate you because
[02:42:30.120 --> 02:42:34.680]  they know deep down you love freedom in America. None of us are perfect, but they know you're
[02:42:34.680 --> 02:42:40.320]  not a globalist control freak criminal like them and you're their enemy. That's why they
[02:42:40.320 --> 02:42:45.680]  want us to kill each other. Think like they do. Think more sophisticated. Understand what's
[02:42:45.680 --> 02:42:52.920]  happening here. You understand how close we are to not being on the radio, martial law
[02:42:52.920 --> 02:42:59.080]  and go into the next phase. And I'll say right here on air, I don't plan to be like Travis
[02:42:59.080 --> 02:43:03.200]  at the Alamo, you know, out there in some assault, but you know, Travis was where he
[02:43:03.200 --> 02:43:08.320]  was at and they came to him. Now this stuff all collapses folks. I'm not going to be out
[02:43:08.320 --> 02:43:13.120]  there like Rambo trying to lead people around and some type of, you know, fight. I'm fighting
[02:43:13.120 --> 02:43:21.480]  in the info war right now. And I'm just praying that we can turn this thing around. But if
[02:43:21.480 --> 02:43:28.520]  the military and police with the PR and peer pressure go with the roundup plans and, and,
[02:43:28.520 --> 02:43:33.200]  and, and try to go out and arrest people and try to take us to FEMA camps for reeducation
[02:43:33.200 --> 02:43:37.120]  and for a lot of us to get raped, tortured and killed, you're going to be resisted. So
[02:43:37.120 --> 02:43:42.520]  you get what you deserve. Remember that. Think about what I'm saying here. If you join these
[02:43:42.520 --> 02:43:48.880]  people through willful ignorance or peer pressure or saying, oh, well, you know, it couldn't
[02:43:48.880 --> 02:43:54.200]  be true. And oh, yeah, the right wingers or libertarians are really blowing stuff up.
[02:43:54.200 --> 02:43:58.920]  So we got to arrest them when it, when it's the criminals that took over the government
[02:43:58.920 --> 02:44:06.760]  that are doing it. If you go along with them at that point, you have absolutely sold yourself,
[02:44:06.760 --> 02:44:11.440]  your family, your country down the tubes. And by the way, you're probably going to get
[02:44:11.440 --> 02:44:18.000]  killed too. Because once you start attacking veterans and conservatives, libertarians who
[02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:23.600]  are professional, controlled, focused people, once you draw first blood and start something,
[02:44:23.600 --> 02:44:27.520]  it's going to be open season. And I would not want to be you. And that's why police
[02:44:27.520 --> 02:44:32.000]  say, oh, we're not going to confiscate guns. No, sir. A, because you know, it's the second
[02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:37.080]  amendment, you know, it's tyranny if they do it. But deep down B, you know, it's a death
[02:44:37.080 --> 02:44:42.080]  warrant. You might as well go jump off a cliff without a parachute. If you try that, well,
[02:44:42.080 --> 02:44:47.320]  but here's what's going to happen. They've degenerated the inner city neighborhoods.
[02:44:47.320 --> 02:44:51.960]  They have brought in the drugs. They have broken down the culture with the MTV and all
[02:44:51.960 --> 02:44:56.320]  the rest of it. They're doing it to everybody, but particularly black folks. And I've seen
[02:44:56.320 --> 02:45:00.680]  gun confiscation start in the black neighborhoods of New Orleans and move on to the next place.
[02:45:00.680 --> 02:45:04.160]  So they'll say, oh, there's gang bang and everything's falling apart. People be begging
[02:45:04.160 --> 02:45:09.600]  the end to take the guns. That will set the precedent. So don't tell me you'll never confiscate
[02:45:09.600 --> 02:45:16.160]  guns. If they get you in peer pressure and they frame it the right way and there's looting
[02:45:16.160 --> 02:45:23.960]  going on, that'll set the precedent prime the pump. And it'll be like putting, you know,
[02:45:23.960 --> 02:45:29.320]  gasoline and an engine that's got water in it. It'll be sputtering and banging and sure.
[02:45:29.320 --> 02:45:33.760]  Most areas, the police and military will say no. Turns out a lot of the regular army did
[02:45:33.760 --> 02:45:38.160]  say no at Katrina. That just never made it on the news. They showed units that would
[02:45:38.160 --> 02:45:42.400]  do it on the news and try to acclimate everyone. And the ABC reporter that was part of that
[02:45:42.400 --> 02:45:46.320]  report went to Iraq and got his face blown off. Woodward that he's already back on the
[02:45:46.320 --> 02:45:51.280]  air. The point is that was his bad luck for me and part of that. The point is that this
[02:45:51.280 --> 02:45:55.720]  is real. Ladies and gentlemen, I get up every day and look at my children and think about
[02:45:55.720 --> 02:46:02.360]  man, I, I have endangered you doing this. My whole family, we are, we are on the front
[02:46:02.360 --> 02:46:06.280]  lines. I look at my little innocent children and I think, but then I realized, Hey, they
[02:46:06.280 --> 02:46:11.240]  have no future if we don't beat these people anyways. And I'll be honest, if there was
[02:46:11.240 --> 02:46:15.920]  some free continent with freer people and I could immigrate and be accepted, I would
[02:46:15.920 --> 02:46:20.640]  leave right now, even though my family goes back like many of your families to the first
[02:46:20.640 --> 02:46:26.040]  colonies here, you know, the Mayflower, all of it. And the founding of Texas and I'm an
[02:46:26.040 --> 02:46:32.120]  American 110% and I love this country, but I'll be honest, we're in such bad straits.
[02:46:32.120 --> 02:46:35.840]  If there was, if there was a place that wasn't run by these globalist or what, or didn't
[02:46:35.840 --> 02:46:43.400]  have its own tyranny, I would be gone right now gone. There is nowhere to run. There is
[02:46:43.400 --> 02:46:50.360]  the only place to run is straight Adam. The only place to run is straight Adam. You understand
[02:46:50.360 --> 02:46:55.360]  that the only place to run is straight Adam straight Adam. I'll give you the football
[02:46:55.360 --> 02:47:01.640]  analogy. It's well known. You go 110%. That means harder than you thought you could go.
[02:47:01.640 --> 02:47:06.600]  People make fun of 110%. They've done, you know, they've hypnotized weight lifters and
[02:47:06.600 --> 02:47:11.080]  they can bench press 100 pounds extra if they hypnotize them. They can squat 200 pounds
[02:47:11.080 --> 02:47:17.640]  more. Oh, you can only squat 600? Here, hypnotize 800 with hypnosis and other things. You can
[02:47:17.640 --> 02:47:25.200]  only bench press 400. Now you can bench press 400, 500 in some studies. They've put people
[02:47:25.200 --> 02:47:28.880]  on drugs before and hypnotize them and they bench press 200 pounds more than they thought
[02:47:28.880 --> 02:47:34.720]  they could. It's the same thing. You go 90% you're going to get injured. You go 80% you're
[02:47:34.720 --> 02:47:40.320]  going to get injured. You go 50% you're going to get injured. You've got to go 110%. And
[02:47:40.320 --> 02:47:45.640]  then you're going to find out there is a 10% above that and above that and above that.
[02:47:45.640 --> 02:47:49.440]  And folks, if you can't even get out, and by the way, today's the last day to go out
[02:47:49.440 --> 02:47:54.000]  and hang up Obama posters. I'm going to extend it through Monday because I got behind with
[02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:57.960]  a bunch of stuff and I want to be able to judge it. So last day to get them in is Monday,
[02:47:57.960 --> 02:48:02.200]  hang up the Obama posters, the action of being on the streets, saying no to the tyranny,
[02:48:02.200 --> 02:48:10.320]  getting involved, do that. And you win $10,000. But I mean, just the idea of bullhorning for
[02:48:10.320 --> 02:48:14.840]  the first time or handing out DVDs for the first time or making your own YouTube video,
[02:48:14.840 --> 02:48:17.680]  speaking out on something, doesn't mean you have all the answers. Doesn't mean you're
[02:48:17.680 --> 02:48:23.720]  not going to get attacked. You've got to take those first steps. I know those first steps
[02:48:23.720 --> 02:48:28.360]  are the hardest because a lot of people don't respect themselves. Let me tell you something.
[02:48:28.360 --> 02:48:33.720]  You are the answer. Okay. You are the people that are going to have to beat this. They
[02:48:33.720 --> 02:48:38.080]  could pull their kill switch now. They're getting everybody ready for it in the news.
[02:48:38.080 --> 02:48:42.800]  They could shut me off tomorrow. They could nuke a major city grandstand. You're going
[02:48:42.800 --> 02:48:47.440]  to see your neighbors put candles out front their houses and say, I know you said Obama
[02:48:47.440 --> 02:48:52.920]  was going to do it or I still I've just got to get behind them because of the hype. When
[02:48:52.920 --> 02:49:02.920]  that hype comes down, you have got to say no at that point. I want to go back to a subject
[02:49:02.920 --> 02:49:10.280]  I mentioned at the start of the show and I said I'd do a whole talk on this today. Perhaps
[02:49:10.280 --> 02:49:14.680]  I should just do it the first hour of the show on Sunday. I was talking about Kingdom
[02:49:14.680 --> 02:49:19.560]  of the Robots because there was this article out of CBS News Navy beginning to implement
[02:49:19.560 --> 02:49:29.720]  underwater drones in the Gulf and the Strait of Hormush. Now, they've always had drones
[02:49:29.720 --> 02:49:33.400]  for 30 plus years. We had in the world war two, they had remote control aircraft. The
[02:49:33.400 --> 02:49:39.000]  Germans did as well. The point is there's air drones. There's C drones. There's surface
[02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:44.680]  drones. There's a UGVs and we cover that in our drone shot down over Texas video. Just
[02:49:44.680 --> 02:49:52.720]  search that. You'll find it. Pretty amazing video. But the point is this is the Kingdom
[02:49:52.720 --> 02:49:58.120]  of the Robots. This is where humans are taken out of the equation and I'll pledge you this.
[02:49:58.120 --> 02:50:04.760]  I'll be here Sunday live four to six p.m. central and I will talk about dehumanization
[02:50:04.760 --> 02:50:11.880]  and how we're being taken out of the decision process and being minimized coming up on Sunday
[02:50:11.880 --> 02:50:18.400]  show. And then I'm not going to really be taking off. I'm going to be working some,
[02:50:18.400 --> 02:50:21.880]  but I had been planning to go to Colorado for a week and a half to do some investigations
[02:50:21.880 --> 02:50:28.040]  and things and also take at least my son along. He keeps wanting to go to Colorado so I can
[02:50:28.040 --> 02:50:35.000]  work on the road and do both. But then the engine blew up on the old bus we got. So I
[02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:41.520]  don't want to cancel the guest toast we've got next week. So John B. Wells, J. B. Wells
[02:50:41.520 --> 02:50:49.480]  is doing Monday and then Mike Adams is doing Tuesday. But we're going to have a special
[02:50:49.480 --> 02:50:55.080]  report one of those hours. I think it will be Tuesday with Mike Adams. So he'll just
[02:50:55.080 --> 02:50:59.400]  do two hours. But we need to let Mike know that he's booking guests right now. So program
[02:50:59.400 --> 02:51:04.560]  note there. More news coming up. Let me ask you a question. What does freedom mean to

[02:53:03.800 --> 02:53:09.280]  book, Cancer Step Outside the Box. I want you to know some very important information.
[02:53:09.280 --> 02:53:14.080]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White
[02:53:14.080 --> 02:53:19.680]  House at a time when only the president could obtain this world-class healer. Now, 27 years
[02:53:19.680 --> 02:53:24.320]  later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy. Now, you
[02:53:24.320 --> 02:53:29.400]  can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring
[02:53:29.400 --> 02:53:34.480]  compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal
[02:53:34.480 --> 02:53:38.760]  cell. If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical
[02:53:38.760 --> 02:53:45.480]  immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body. Call 1-866-VENUS-FLY

[02:54:16.080 --> 02:54:36.080]  But the fool on the hill sees the world turning round. We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:54:36.080 --> 02:54:43.600]  Yeah, just look at these headlines. DHS emergency power extended, including control of private
[02:54:43.600 --> 02:54:48.720]  telecom systems where they can just hack in and the government can take everything over.
[02:54:48.720 --> 02:54:53.200]  If you have a central switch, that could allow enemies, of course, the enemies have taken
[02:54:53.200 --> 02:54:59.200]  over to take it over. I mean, just creating one of these switches allows this to happen.
[02:54:59.200 --> 02:55:04.520]  Amazing. And how long have we warned you about that? Woman convicted of battery for patdown
[02:55:04.520 --> 02:55:10.640]  of TSA worker. That's up at infowars.com and prisonpunna.com. Action was protest against
[02:55:10.640 --> 02:55:14.920]  invasive groping, which included her genitals being touched. But again, government grope
[02:55:14.920 --> 02:55:19.400]  shoe, not the other way around. This is all reeducation camp training, literally, where
[02:55:19.400 --> 02:55:23.680]  they tell you freeze and all the rest of it. It's your prisoner training. And it's bipartisan,
[02:55:23.680 --> 02:55:28.240]  folks. It's not just the communist arm of this, of the Democratic Party. And all of you out
[02:55:28.240 --> 02:55:32.720]  there that think collectivism and the Democratic Party is cute, folks, you're like Stalinistic
[02:55:32.720 --> 02:55:39.520]  dupes. And again, Condi Rai. So she's at the top of the list for VP. And she supports
[02:55:39.520 --> 02:55:44.720]  abortion. I meant to get to that clip. Guys, do you have the Mitt Romney flip flopping on
[02:55:44.720 --> 02:55:52.840]  abortion? Yeah, we're going to go ahead and play that here because it just illustrates
[02:55:52.840 --> 02:55:56.720]  the fact that this is the guy that when it comes to really take an action, kind of like
[02:55:56.720 --> 02:56:01.200]  Justice Roberts, they're going to deliver the globalist takeover because the bankers
[02:56:01.200 --> 02:56:07.720]  want the collectivism. Here is that clip. So when asked, well, I preserve and protect
[02:56:07.720 --> 02:56:12.640]  the women's right to choose, I make an unequivocal answer. Yes. No, I'm saying I changed my mind
[02:56:12.640 --> 02:56:17.400]  and you can look at my record as governor and you can see in my record as governor that
[02:56:17.400 --> 02:56:21.880]  I have consistently been pro-life. I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in
[02:56:21.880 --> 02:56:26.960]  this country. I have since the time that my mom took that position when she ran in 1970
[02:56:26.960 --> 02:56:32.160]  as a U.S. Senate candidate. I believe that since Roe v. Wade has been the law for 20 years,
[02:56:32.160 --> 02:56:36.560]  that we should sustain and support it. And I sustain and support that law. I will be
[02:56:36.560 --> 02:56:39.560]  a pro-life president. I'll appoint.
[02:56:39.560 --> 02:56:46.680]  So when I ran for office, I was effectively a pro-choice. I didn't call myself a pro-choice,
[02:56:46.680 --> 02:56:51.080]  but I said I just like I've been a pro-life governor. I believe based on what I read that
[02:56:51.080 --> 02:56:55.560]  the world, the world is getting warmer. That's enough. That's enough. That's enough. You
[02:56:55.560 --> 02:56:59.440]  know, the notice he said he's going to get rid of the healthcare law, but now he's like,
[02:56:59.440 --> 02:57:05.640]  well, the Supreme Court has spoken and it's not a tax. Let me support Obama. I'm almost
[02:57:05.640 --> 02:57:11.000]  like, yeah, you're a criminal. He's be arrested. Now that's not very sweet. I mean, he's laying
[02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:16.440]  down to Obama. I wish Mitt Romney was better than Obama. I never believed in lesser or
[02:57:16.440 --> 02:57:21.800]  two evils. I'm so desperate. I'd go for it. It isn't. This is what the elite wants. This
[02:57:21.800 --> 02:57:30.880]  is what they get. And we're head long down the rat hole. And now Condi Rice. Drugs broke
[02:57:30.880 --> 02:57:37.600]  this yesterday. Big international story. Condi Rice is at the top of the bill right now to
[02:57:37.600 --> 02:57:45.840]  be derp here to be the VP for Romney. And it is just thoroughly, thoroughly disgusting.
[02:57:45.840 --> 02:57:51.760]  And again, I keep getting IMs and comments and seeing this. I get these questions under
[02:57:51.760 --> 02:57:58.320]  executive order entitled assignment of national security emergency preparedness communications
[02:57:58.320 --> 02:58:02.600]  Obama has enabled the executive branch of control communications under all circumstances to
[02:58:02.600 --> 02:58:09.120]  ensure national security. That's quote, effectively manage emergencies and improve national defense.
[02:58:09.120 --> 02:58:14.200]  And then they went on to ask me, Alex, why are you not covering this? Okay, I cover it
[02:58:14.200 --> 02:58:19.840]  every day, but the people on YouTube, they didn't see it in that one video. So it must
[02:58:19.840 --> 02:58:24.200]  mean I've never, never talked about it. So I apologize that I've never talked about the
[02:58:24.200 --> 02:58:28.120]  kill switches being put in that I've been covering since 1996 that they're now getting
[02:58:28.120 --> 02:58:31.720]  ready to go operational with. So I apologize for being right as usual. Because even when
[02:58:31.720 --> 02:58:37.640]  I'm right, I'm wrong. You know how it is. It's bad to be right. I apologize. I apologize.
[02:58:37.640 --> 02:58:55.400]  And I guess I'm not conservative because I don't like abortion.
