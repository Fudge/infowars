[00:00.000 --> 00:11.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.480 --> 00:19.000]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.000 --> 00:29.000]  Texas Alex Jones you know it seems like I say this at the start of every
[00:29.000 --> 00:35.800]  broadcast because it's true I sit here looking at all this news and I just
[00:35.800 --> 00:42.200]  marvel marvel at what is going on and how fast the tyranny is moving not just
[00:42.200 --> 00:47.440]  here in the US but worldwide at the same time the awakening to what is going
[00:47.440 --> 00:51.880]  on is happening but you've got all these criminal interests that are running
[00:51.880 --> 00:55.600]  the government and some of the major corporations and they're made up of
[00:55.600 --> 00:59.920]  individuals they're bound together for their lust for global domination but
[00:59.920 --> 01:03.200]  the individuals just don't care if they're getting caught they don't care
[01:03.200 --> 01:07.360]  if they even get in trouble it's it's kind of a feeding frenzy of evil and
[01:07.360 --> 01:13.520]  despotism and and and looting what you tend to see before things fully
[01:13.520 --> 01:18.200]  collapse and they've got plans to consolidate power during that collapse
[01:18.200 --> 01:24.680]  and the plan is a police state so that we are converted from being a wealthy
[01:24.680 --> 01:31.480]  Western world to being a third world slash old world tyranny the news is
[01:31.480 --> 01:35.760]  obviously off the chart and what I said yesterday is now being borne out to be
[01:35.760 --> 01:41.920]  accurate this is the first salvo by the new larger majority of the good old
[01:41.920 --> 01:47.800]  demo rats in the Senate and El Presidente who has shown he doesn't even
[01:47.800 --> 01:53.680]  care what the Congress does on any issue this is dictatorial Obama is by all
[01:53.680 --> 02:00.640]  measurements now a dictator and he's acting in a dictatorial fashion that's
[02:00.640 --> 02:08.080]  not disputed and they are announcing they're going after all semi-auto hand
[02:08.080 --> 02:13.160]  guns and rifles and quote inexpensive firearms and quote firearms that could
[02:13.160 --> 02:18.320]  be converted and basically everything they are coming for our guns and people
[02:18.320 --> 02:23.960]  say well there's no way they'll do that oh yes they will yes they will they will
[02:23.960 --> 02:27.880]  implode the economy bring us into a depression launch some hardcore wars and

[02:31.400 --> 02:39.160]  buildings and blame it on patriots now that is in the New World Order crime
[02:39.160 --> 02:44.760]  syndicate management team known as the Obama administration that group of
[02:44.760 --> 02:51.040]  coaches running this crime syndicate team their favorite plays our stage terror
[02:51.040 --> 02:55.480]  attacks stage crises to be blamed on Americans that love freedom and
[02:55.480 --> 03:01.560]  understand they're a bunch of criminals and they are planning to absolutely stage
[03:01.560 --> 03:05.640]  all sorts of stuff this attorney general was intimately involved in the cover-up
[03:05.640 --> 03:10.400]  of Oklahoma City we know Clintons people carried it out that's been proven
[03:10.400 --> 03:15.520]  it's covered in the film I'm in noble lie all the documentation expanding on
[03:15.520 --> 03:22.280]  that if you go out from that point this attorney general stage fast and furious
[03:22.280 --> 03:26.680]  to blame the second amendment he was deputy attorney general then in 95 and
[03:26.680 --> 03:31.640]  you can see all the pre-programming all the conditioning all of it moving into
[03:31.640 --> 03:36.880]  that and now they're not facing a reelection now they've got the media
[03:36.880 --> 03:40.560]  that the corporate media basically going along with anything they want or
[03:40.560 --> 03:47.800]  anything they push and we are moving into that sector of maximum threat of
[03:47.800 --> 03:54.360]  false flags sooner rather than later now let's be clear exposing the false flag

[04:10.800 --> 04:14.320]  there were patriots that picked up on happened with Oklahoma City and exposed
[04:14.320 --> 04:18.480]  it day one they had to kill some cops and other people to cover it up and we've
[04:18.480 --> 04:22.960]  had you know their families and others on the show to break it down at the same

[24:09.440 --> 24:15.680]  coming up Lindsay Williams always informative and thought-provoking is
[24:15.680 --> 24:19.840]  joining us in the next hour and then Max Kaiser will also premiere a special
[24:19.840 --> 24:26.120]  report that I have produced with Aaron Dykes dealing with the all-out
[24:26.120 --> 24:30.520]  announcement and admissions they've sounded the bugle the establishment is
[24:30.520 --> 24:35.360]  coming to disarm us and I'm gonna break down why but here's the deal when when
[24:35.360 --> 24:40.600]  Bob Costas went on Sunday night football and said I agree with this
[24:40.600 --> 24:45.440]  columnist so let me just read off the telepompter and quote him that handguns
[24:45.440 --> 24:49.040]  are bad you have no business having them and that the gun culture is what the
[24:49.040 --> 24:55.880]  NFL has that is a pure scapegoating that is an attempt to blame the Second
[24:55.880 --> 25:02.560]  Amendment law and order Constitution super low crime rates on record areas
[25:02.560 --> 25:07.560]  that are constitutionalist the media would call it conservative it's just an
[25:07.560 --> 25:12.320]  absolute fact you pass concealed carry crime drops on average 25% it's an
[25:12.320 --> 25:15.720]  absolute fact the higher the gun ownership the lower the crime rate the
[25:15.720 --> 25:20.880]  more polite people are but you've got a gangster culture in rap and hip-hop but
[25:20.880 --> 25:24.240]  also a lot of the rock and roll now that's I'm gonna kill you I'm gonna shoot
[25:24.240 --> 25:28.320]  you and you've got people in these cities where they've banned guns killing
[25:28.320 --> 25:32.880]  each other at worldwide record numbers worldwide record numbers where they
[25:32.880 --> 25:37.360]  banned guns just like Mexico has some worldwide record numbers total gun ban
[25:37.360 --> 25:43.600]  for the citizens so Costas comes out and he says hey it's the Second
[25:43.600 --> 25:49.760]  Amendment's fault and you know they fired Hank Williams Jr. for saying our
[25:49.760 --> 25:53.880]  country's becoming a tyranny they fired him for saying that on another show
[25:53.880 --> 26:00.640]  this was said during the Star Spangled Banner this was said during the
[26:00.640 --> 26:03.720]  beginning of the game and and there were other similar comments I've now
[26:03.720 --> 26:07.360]  learned I wasn't watching it later in the game I've gone back and found them
[26:07.360 --> 26:11.560]  on YouTube where they were blaming the Second Amendment not the drugs not the
[26:11.560 --> 26:15.520]  corrupt culture not the prescription drugs not the concussions not the gang
[26:15.520 --> 26:21.920]  bangers spoiled rotten culture that's like blaming dog owners for Michael Vic
[26:21.920 --> 26:26.160]  killing pit bulls and electrocuting them and torturing them and all this saying
[26:26.160 --> 26:29.920]  well we've got a banned dog ownership which is what PETA by the way says they
[26:29.920 --> 26:33.360]  says it's abusive to have animals period so let's just ban dog ownership
[26:33.360 --> 26:38.240]  because Michael Vic did something wrong hey cuz one person drives drunk really
[26:38.240 --> 26:42.840]  drunk and inebriated drives recklessly that's what you're charged folks for back
[26:42.840 --> 26:45.480]  in the day oh you were recklessly driving that's what you're charged for I
[26:45.480 --> 26:50.640]  could see it you were out of control boom serious jail time not oh you had two
[26:50.640 --> 26:54.400]  bears are going to jail again this is everybody's guilty now oh we're just
[26:54.400 --> 26:57.680]  gonna set up a checkpoint on this highway or major road and we're gonna
[26:57.680 --> 27:01.920]  search and breathalyzer all of you and have no refusal where we take blood if
[27:01.920 --> 27:05.480]  you say no when we stick a breathalyzer in your face that's what all these
[27:05.480 --> 27:10.320]  federally funded no refusal weekends are now it's no refusal ever because we say
[27:10.320 --> 27:16.360]  so rubber stamp fake warrants see it's oh somebody did something wrong with a
[27:16.360 --> 27:24.160]  gun you're gonna lose your gun now and this Fox Sports columnist that Costas
[27:24.160 --> 27:30.760]  was quoting Jason Whitlock I then discovered yesterday afternoon that he
[27:30.760 --> 27:34.760]  was on a syndicated radio show and doing other interviews there's multiple
[27:34.760 --> 27:40.000]  ones and we're gonna play the clip when come back from break openly saying that
[27:40.000 --> 27:45.400]  if you own a gun you are KKK and that you want black people to kill each other
[27:45.400 --> 27:49.800]  so it's not the fault of the gangster rap saying kill kill kill I'm so manly
[27:49.800 --> 27:54.960]  it's not the fault of Chicago corrupt government manning guns or New York or
[27:54.960 --> 28:00.080]  other crime syndicates that have seized great American cities no no no it's the
[28:00.080 --> 28:07.680]  fault of white people he actually says this white people are racist and are
[28:07.680 --> 28:14.120]  KKK and the NRA is KKK folks if the NRA doesn't sue this guy and I'm not
[28:14.120 --> 28:20.600]  litigious but man when somebody gets up there and says you are KKK white
[28:20.600 --> 28:26.960]  people are KKK NRA is KKK if you believe in gun ownership not only is it pure
[28:26.960 --> 28:32.480]  slander defamation meant to hurt people on its face the the the measure of of
[28:32.480 --> 28:39.840]  boom you are convicted of slander of defamation of libel ladies and gentlemen
[28:39.840 --> 28:48.360]  it flies in the face 180 degrees perfect lies perfect fraud perfect scam do
[28:48.360 --> 28:52.720]  you know on record and AP Reuters have had to admit it daily callers got a
[28:52.720 --> 28:55.720]  great boil down basically copy from choose the preservation of firearms

[29:01.240 --> 29:05.040]  another report coming out on this that I shot last night we were up here it was
[29:05.040 --> 29:09.600]  upper-past midnight we didn't get it out we went and got the history of it do you
[29:09.600 --> 29:16.640]  know who in the southern states got the first gun control laws passed in 1867
[29:16.640 --> 29:22.520]  eight nine and in 1870 when more than 15 states passed laws against the second
[29:22.520 --> 29:28.720]  moment the first ever do you know who got it passed the KKK literally lobbied
[29:28.720 --> 29:33.600]  and even lobbied in Washington and there's even photos from the time and
[29:33.600 --> 29:44.640]  got gun laws passed I mean the KKK created gun control in this country and

[33:27.680 --> 33:32.560]  now I'm reading more of this guy's writings he says gun ownership is racist
[33:32.560 --> 33:40.080]  he says owning guns is evil and he says that the NRA the NRA is quote the new
[33:40.080 --> 33:45.160]  KKK and actually that report is now out the video report at info wars.com
[33:45.160 --> 33:50.320]  they're in the featured news it's my other report on Bob Costas coming out
[33:50.320 --> 33:59.560]  and saying let me clarify my statement to USA today and he says in the report
[33:59.560 --> 34:05.080]  and that video is going live right now or I break that down he says in USA today
[34:05.080 --> 34:11.040]  that you're too stupid to understand what he meant and that he just thinks
[34:11.040 --> 34:15.940]  there should be reasonable restrictions on guns and that means you can't have a
[34:15.940 --> 34:20.520]  handgun he said he thinks it's fine if you're under the proper controls if you
[34:20.520 --> 34:25.120]  hunt here and let me read the quote here in favor of people owning guns to hunt
[34:25.120 --> 34:30.200]  and carry them in a responsibly controlled circumstances like Chicago
[34:30.200 --> 34:34.560]  New York or Total Gun Bands so there you go I mean ladies and gentlemen the
[34:34.560 --> 34:38.640]  police can't and won't protect you it's time you demand the right to keep an
[34:38.640 --> 34:42.560]  bare arm so that law abiding citizens don't get thrown in jail when you take
[34:42.560 --> 34:46.880]  on the basic human right of defending yourself now before I get to this clip I
[34:46.880 --> 34:53.040]  I want to explain something to Jason Whitlock of Fox Sports buddy we are
[34:53.040 --> 34:59.040]  coming after you okay the second amendment is my line in the sand and I am
[34:59.040 --> 35:05.680]  calling for Fox Sports to fire you you need to be fired and if the NRA doesn't
[35:05.680 --> 35:09.360]  come after you then I'm gonna have a problem with the NRA because they've
[35:09.360 --> 35:14.800]  just said the NRA and the quote gun culture are white supremacists who want
[35:14.800 --> 35:21.000]  to kill black people I'm gonna play the clip okay and I'm sick of it okay they
[35:21.000 --> 35:25.360]  look the globalist the media they use race as a weapon oh you don't want
[35:25.360 --> 35:27.920]  government-run health care written by insurance companies you're a racist oh
[35:27.920 --> 35:31.120]  you don't want checkpoints you're a racist oh you caught bribery at the
[35:31.120 --> 35:36.240]  state capitol where the white guy or they call it said are you a racist against
[35:36.240 --> 35:39.520]  black people and I'm like what though the Austin American statesman and I said
[35:39.520 --> 35:42.720]  is this a real number are you really your statesman writer let me call you back
[35:42.720 --> 35:46.440]  I call back at the news desk get the guy on the phone this happened 12 years
[35:46.440 --> 35:51.200]  ago he's like do you believe I'm a reporter now and I was like yeah why'd
[35:51.200 --> 35:55.240]  you ask me if I'm a racist and the guy started laughing they're cold-blooded
[35:55.240 --> 35:59.920]  folks they use this as a weapon system you give us your money you give us your
[35:59.920 --> 36:04.320]  rights or I'm gonna call you a racist well good call me one this thing you've
[36:04.320 --> 36:08.120]  got to call their bluff on this folks the way they've set up the prisons in the
[36:08.120 --> 36:11.520]  prison culture they put everybody in the prisons the whites the blacks the
[36:11.520 --> 36:15.400]  Hispanics the Asians if it's on the east or west coast and three to four
[36:15.400 --> 36:20.480]  different groups where you've got to join a race gang or you're dead and and
[36:20.480 --> 36:26.200]  they the system wants this the Democratic Party got caught being the
[36:26.200 --> 36:32.040]  Ku Klux Klan and they got caught running all this so they stole the big
[36:32.040 --> 36:37.000]  socialist experiment from Teddy Roosevelt and and government largesse and
[36:37.000 --> 36:41.280]  and out did the Republican Party because in their own words as Margaret
[36:41.280 --> 36:43.440]  Singer said it's the only way we're gonna be able to kill all the black
[36:43.440 --> 36:49.920]  people and now they've got these these these these house organ propagandists
[36:49.920 --> 36:56.520]  that go out in Judas Goat black folks Hispanics you name it and you notice
[36:56.520 --> 36:59.920]  black folks can have groups that are race-based you can have the Hispanic
[36:59.920 --> 37:03.800]  groups called Laraza which means the race and all this stuff because that's
[37:03.800 --> 37:07.680]  because the system wants to get all that as a race-based system that government
[37:07.680 --> 37:11.520]  controls while telling white people they're inherently evil give the
[37:11.520 --> 37:15.800]  government the foreign banks all your tax money or you're a racist so we have
[37:15.800 --> 37:21.960]  to go after Bob Costas look he he came out with this insulting apology it's not
[37:21.960 --> 37:25.760]  an apology it's a clarification USA Today said and then they changed the
[37:25.760 --> 37:29.520]  headline overnight like I've got that back in dues office that the article
[37:29.520 --> 37:31.800]  before they changed the headline if somebody will go find it it's laying
[37:31.800 --> 37:36.040]  around somewhere in his office it's somewhere around here as I was up here
[37:36.040 --> 37:41.800]  until like nine at night NBC's Bob Costas take on criticism of his gun comments
[37:41.800 --> 37:48.720]  it was Bob Costas clarifies his statement now they've changed the
[37:48.720 --> 37:53.280]  headline again and it's his statement through his PR person that basically
[37:53.280 --> 37:58.600]  you're too stupid he says that he feels unfortunate leap was taken that he was
[37:58.600 --> 38:01.560]  advocating taking away the Second Amendment rights no he just plugged the
[38:01.560 --> 38:05.600]  column and said he totally agrees with it calling for banning handguns and said
[38:05.600 --> 38:08.800]  handguns are evil and you shouldn't have them exactly what the White House and
[38:08.800 --> 38:12.520]  and Eric Holder and all of them are announcing they're gonna ban handguns
[38:12.520 --> 38:17.280]  physical possession make you turn them in and rifles all semi-autos and even
[38:17.280 --> 38:22.280]  non-semi-autos that they say could be converted to semi-autom they're already
[38:22.280 --> 38:26.240]  announcing they want to ban most shotguns most rifles most handguns it's on
[38:26.240 --> 38:31.800]  they're now claiming that revolvers are semi-auto even though they're not but
[38:31.800 --> 38:36.280]  who cares I mean you know the president says he doesn't need law anymore for
[38:36.280 --> 38:39.480]  the UN to run the military or for him to sign an executive order on cyber
[38:39.480 --> 38:43.920]  security and not let Congress theater shut down power plants or signing
[38:43.920 --> 38:50.560]  statements on and on and on Obama says you'll have the most open presidency
[38:50.560 --> 38:53.600]  most closed ever says he won't sign executive order signs more than all
[38:53.600 --> 39:00.920]  presidents combined in four years on and on and on and on says he's fighting the
[39:00.920 --> 39:06.560]  NDA a wrote the NDA a says he won't sign it signs it but all these idiots sit
[39:06.560 --> 39:13.040]  there yeah here's the USA today I guess there's been three different headline
[39:13.040 --> 39:19.640]  look at this Bob Costas take on criticism on his gun comments on the
[39:19.640 --> 39:24.640]  original one I can't there's so many copies around here I don't know okay
[39:24.640 --> 39:29.120]  I'm gonna play the clip this just gets me so upset ladies and gentlemen I mean
[39:29.120 --> 39:35.040]  this is a violent race-baiting violent I will listen I got up here and I said
[39:35.040 --> 39:38.480]  Dinecourt that's the biggest private CPS contractor in the United States that's
[39:38.480 --> 39:42.600]  another fact well it came out congressional hearings was running
[39:42.600 --> 39:46.880]  kidnapping rings of women and children by the tens of thousands in Europe and
[39:46.880 --> 39:50.320]  they didn't even get in trouble and that was in the Chicago Tribune it was in
[39:50.320 --> 39:55.600]  the BBC we've made films about it now if that wasn't true if you're a new
[39:55.600 --> 39:59.520]  listener and you just tuned in and go this is crazy yeah reality is crazy
[39:59.520 --> 40:04.120]  Stalin and Hitler and Mao were crazy history is wild truth is stranger than
[40:04.120 --> 40:07.480]  fiction I'm not the crazy one I got my head screwed on straight and I'm freaked
[40:07.480 --> 40:11.040]  out about this and want to motivate you to wake up so this nightmare doesn't get
[40:11.040 --> 40:15.920]  worse I'm like somebody in one of those old movies where they're you know in the
[40:15.920 --> 40:19.080]  temple looking for the gold and all the sudden the water starts pouring into the
[40:19.080 --> 40:22.240]  sand starts pouring in and the walls start closing and I'm like we got to find
[40:22.240 --> 40:26.120]  the trapdoor escape hatch or we're dead you're like take it easy it's not that
[40:26.120 --> 40:29.680]  bad I'm like no no we've seen this in history this is dangerous we need to
[40:29.680 --> 40:37.480]  revert oh no I like the rising water it's like a hot tub but just because you
[40:37.480 --> 40:42.240]  got a bunch of brain damage my numb fluoride heads Prozac heads out there
[40:42.240 --> 40:46.280]  they don't count if they want to be my numb it's those of us that know what's
[40:46.280 --> 40:51.080]  going on we're a larger minority black white old young it doesn't matter who
[40:51.080 --> 40:54.720]  love freedom and know what's going on we are a giant minority compared to the
[40:54.720 --> 40:59.320]  tiny elite minority so we need to stop freaking out if some of our neighbors
[40:59.320 --> 41:02.720]  laugh at us because they're so insecure when they hear something scary they
[41:02.720 --> 41:06.080]  just want to laugh at you if people say Alex you're trying to scare us well
[41:06.080 --> 41:10.160]  those are cowards folks cowards don't count because they're a coward they think
[41:10.160 --> 41:13.760]  you're trying to scare them people say I get scared listen to your show you get
[41:13.760 --> 41:20.240]  scared all of that is already there this evil is already happening it's not
[41:20.240 --> 41:27.800]  going to go away denying it and I'll use the analogy of you know there's a
[41:27.800 --> 41:32.080]  burglar breaking in your house and your wife's like get up Bob you're like you
[41:32.080 --> 41:36.400]  know Marge be quiet you're scaring me and you hear the guy breaking down the
[41:36.400 --> 41:41.840]  door Marge stop waking me up you're scaring me you're a fearmonger well
[41:41.840 --> 41:50.840]  Marge isn't a fearmonger she's saying get up Bob get up Bill get the shotgun don't
[41:50.840 --> 41:54.680]  you understand that my wife started banging and noises before and she's
[41:54.680 --> 42:01.400]  like get a gun like you get it honey what if I'm not here she's a great shot
[42:01.400 --> 42:04.280]  but you know you need women need to think about that too that because
[42:04.280 --> 42:07.040]  obviously I know if something's banging you know out in the woods or out in the
[42:07.040 --> 42:11.840]  country you know that it's just sound bouncing from the next little farm or
[42:11.840 --> 42:15.200]  something you know women are like what is that you know oh my gosh do something
[42:15.200 --> 42:19.280]  the dogs are barking and I'm like you know get the shotgun I'm like honey you
[42:19.280 --> 42:24.320]  get it this is a good drill that sounds like a backhoe digging at night oh that
[42:24.320 --> 42:29.960]  is what it is you know but it's so simple I don't I'm not telling you all
[42:29.960 --> 42:33.800]  this because I live in fear folks I'm willing for them to kill me which they
[42:33.800 --> 42:38.040]  might do to be able to get this out to warn you so these people don't win not
[42:38.040 --> 42:41.840]  because I'm a hero but because I want my children to grow up in a free country I
[42:41.840 --> 42:48.800]  had a fundamental gut level genetic level just like a dog growls at a bad
[42:48.800 --> 42:53.920]  man I am got my hackles up snarling and I'm snapping at the New World Order
[42:53.920 --> 43:06.160]  trying to trying to hit its Achilles heel and it's so fundamental I'm trying
[43:06.160 --> 43:14.160]  to get you moving hey they're knocking down the door they're coming in get
[43:14.160 --> 43:18.520]  ready I'll use the Lord of the Rings analogy because I just watched that
[43:18.520 --> 43:23.640]  after probably five six years not seeing it my son's old enough now ten I
[43:23.640 --> 43:27.120]  think to see it because it's got some good archetypal you know information in
[43:27.120 --> 43:35.000]  it I think overall a healthy story and you know there's the scene where they're
[43:35.000 --> 43:38.200]  down there in the minds of Moria that's been taken over by the orcs 50 years
[43:38.200 --> 43:43.840]  before everybody's dead and they drop a bucket down a mineshaft and all of a
[43:43.840 --> 43:46.880]  sudden they hear the drums boom boom boom boom boom boom boom and they're
[43:46.880 --> 43:50.200]  reading the annals of the last fight there in the throne room about drums
[43:50.200 --> 43:55.680]  drums drums of the deep they are coming they are at the door I mean did they
[43:55.680 --> 43:59.840]  say stop it Gandalf don't tell us the orcs are coming you're a fear monger
[43:59.840 --> 44:04.960]  no it's like get ready they're coming through the door I mean did people come
[44:04.960 --> 44:09.240]  to their windows and say stop it Paul Revere how dare you say an invasion forces
[44:09.240 --> 44:16.160]  is landing how dare you say they're coming to take our guns how dare you
[44:16.160 --> 44:20.240]  did it already happen other areas of the country
[44:22.680 --> 44:27.200]  how do people come out and say how dare you I bet you I think you're a trader I
[44:27.200 --> 44:32.880]  think you're working for the Redcoats Paul Revere telling us they're coming
[44:33.400 --> 44:39.000]  one of my land two of my sea they're coming they're coming drums drums drums
[44:39.000 --> 44:43.040]  in the deep is it drums in the deep they're doing every tyrannical thing you
[44:43.040 --> 44:47.840]  can imagine parading up and down in front of us getting the police and the
[44:47.840 --> 44:52.200]  military ready demonizing the founding fathers demonizing private property
[44:52.200 --> 44:56.600]  demonizing homeschool I mean just exactly what you would expect in a red
[44:56.600 --> 45:01.420]  dawn scenario what would be taught in a reeducation camp and I've got the
[45:01.420 --> 45:04.520]  training videos I put them out publicly where the police sitting around when
[45:04.520 --> 45:08.560]  they're demonizing George Washington FEMA is to firefighters police and
[45:08.560 --> 45:12.280]  sheriff's deputies and the cops they go who are the terrorists George Washington
[45:12.280 --> 45:16.800]  good job you see the police nodding their heads you see a few kind of shifting
[45:16.800 --> 45:20.520]  in their chairs and the FEMA guys watching that you're all being assessed
[45:20.520 --> 45:25.840]  in there if you watch the body language they're assessing who doesn't tell us
[45:25.840 --> 45:29.200]  what you thought of this tell us what you thought of this little meeting we
[45:29.200 --> 45:33.320]  just had I mean these are enemy operatives who've seized our federal
[45:33.320 --> 45:39.000]  government and sees most our states parading around everywhere and now
[45:39.000 --> 45:44.040]  they've got Fox Sportscasters giving talking points to NBC and the NFL and
[45:44.040 --> 45:49.360]  that stuff is pre-approved by the NFL I looked it up not that I needed to for
[45:49.360 --> 45:53.760]  Bob Costas to read off a teleprompter and say handguns are bad and they're
[45:53.760 --> 46:01.680]  what's to blame here and now you are the KKK if you believe in the Second
[46:01.680 --> 46:06.440]  Amendment when it is on record and we have the news articles in the video up
[46:06.440 --> 46:14.360]  at info wars.com right now documenting the entire history of this anti-gun
[46:14.360 --> 46:20.120]  sports columnist Jason Whitlock the NRA is the new KKK I guess we inadvertently
[46:20.120 --> 46:24.400]  borrowed the headline from the Daily Caller that actually well they didn't
[46:24.400 --> 46:26.760]  break it but they got the story out yesterday on that that's where we saw it
[46:26.760 --> 46:30.080]  and then I guess when I shot the video that's the headline we used but there
[46:30.080 --> 46:33.120]  it is that that's a video right there where I show all the documents all the
[46:33.120 --> 46:39.080]  articles all the history it is on record the Ku Klux Klan was the lobbying arm
[46:39.080 --> 46:44.720]  that got gun control passed in this country and you know I'll tell people
[46:44.720 --> 46:48.080]  that say oh let's take this groups rights or that groups rights because they're
[46:48.080 --> 46:52.680]  poor they're whatever folks it will be used on everybody just just from a
[46:52.680 --> 46:57.160]  pragmatic position out there just like Tony Brown says whatever's done to the
[46:57.160 --> 47:00.720]  black community is done in your community so even if you are a tribalist a
[47:00.720 --> 47:05.080]  racist whatever understand whatever's done to any group will come back on you
[47:05.080 --> 47:09.760]  but that's the way the universe works but let's go ahead and play this clip
[47:09.760 --> 47:16.360]  anti-gun sports columnist Jason Whitlock the NRA is the new KKK that would be
[47:16.360 --> 47:23.720]  like that is that is equivalent to saying Rosa Parks was a grand dragon in
[47:23.720 --> 47:30.600]  the Ku Klux Klan it is that it is no no it's like saying Martin Luther King was
[47:30.600 --> 47:36.640]  a grand dragon I mean it is that over the top and and this is all scripted
[47:36.640 --> 47:39.640]  ladies and gentlemen because this is what the ADL and Southern Barbara Law
[47:39.640 --> 47:43.360]  Center say more anti-American groups that are funded by foreign banks on
[47:43.360 --> 47:48.200]  record I mean this is a takeover hey I like freedom shut up racist hey I don't
[47:48.200 --> 47:50.280]  want government health care in the government having death panels and
[47:50.280 --> 47:52.920]  running with care again I really didn't think it worked too well in Europe
[47:52.920 --> 47:58.480]  shut up racist that I mean we it's ridiculous and they sit there like it's
[47:58.480 --> 48:01.200]  a weapon they smile when they say it like you're supposed to go oh man you
[48:01.200 --> 48:06.240]  really got me right there you're right I'm bad take my guns take my guns so
[48:06.240 --> 48:09.960]  here is the guy that gives us talking points to Bob causes that we must boycott
[48:09.960 --> 48:15.680]  here he is Jason Whitlock and Fox News better reprimand this guy but you know
[48:15.680 --> 48:19.400]  what constitutionalist have been trained to roll over the NRA I'll probably say
[48:19.400 --> 48:22.640]  don't call us racist we promise we're not they probably won't even say the
[48:22.640 --> 48:29.440]  Ku Klux Klan got the first gun man's past it's all okay you know oh actually
[48:29.440 --> 48:34.400]  we are racist thank you for calling us that I mean it is ridiculous here is
[48:34.400 --> 48:38.360]  just part of the disgusting transaction on the syndicated radio show where he
[48:38.360 --> 48:42.920]  was speaking here is you know I did not go as far as I would like to go because
[48:42.920 --> 48:50.520]  my thoughts on the NRA and America's gun culture I believe the NRA is the new KKK
[48:50.520 --> 48:58.280]  and that the arming of so many black youths and blowing up our communities
[48:58.280 --> 49:02.920]  with drugs and then just having an open shooting gallery is is the work of
[49:02.920 --> 49:07.160]  people that you know obviously don't have our best interest and I think it's
[49:07.160 --> 49:10.880]  obvious if you travel abroad and travel the country where they actually have
[49:10.880 --> 49:16.640]  some legitimate gun laws we don't have to have what we have here in America where
[49:16.640 --> 49:21.800]  people think a gun somehow enhances their liberty and where people think that a
[49:21.800 --> 49:28.680]  gun somehow makes them safer it just doesn't a gun turns some kids listening
[49:28.680 --> 49:36.200]  to music into a murder scene and you know if you don't have a gun you drive home
[49:36.200 --> 49:39.800]  you know kids listening to some loud music you don't like it that annoys me
[49:39.800 --> 49:44.200]  you go home and complain to your wife when you have a gun you open fire
[49:44.200 --> 49:51.000]  potentially that's enough the life of the clip is up at info wars.com and it
[49:51.000 --> 49:54.600]  is just asinine I mean obviously the places with these high crime rates is
[49:54.600 --> 49:57.840]  where they disarm the general public it's total gangster rap where they
[49:57.840 --> 50:03.440]  glorify killing each other across the board and then people get killed and
[50:03.440 --> 50:07.360]  it's it's not the gangster rap fault it's not that culture's fault being sold
[50:07.360 --> 50:12.160]  by MTV it's not the fault of the quote liberal media pushing and saying how
[50:12.160 --> 50:17.480]  great all this is it's not the fault no no it's the fault of the NRA who's the
[50:17.480 --> 50:23.000]  new KKK who defends the Second Amendment so black people kill themselves
[50:23.000 --> 50:30.040]  unbelievable now there is a tiny grain of truth in there you notice he talked
[50:30.040 --> 50:33.400]  about the drugs so the communities destroy themselves yeah they bring in
[50:33.400 --> 50:38.960]  the drugs so all of us become enslaved but it's it's unbelievable ladies and
[50:38.960 --> 50:44.880]  gentlemen that this is what they're now going to push incredible incredible
[50:44.880 --> 50:49.240]  that that that our society is degenerating and breaking down and the
[50:49.240 --> 50:52.880]  only thing frustrating crime is the Second Amendment and the statistics all
[50:52.880 --> 50:59.880]  proves that unbelievable demonization and race baiting disgusting he needs to

[53:57.080 --> 54:08.480]  deterrent ease the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[54:08.480 --> 54:23.040]  let me analyze what's happening with the gangster culture men are designed when
[54:23.040 --> 54:29.160]  they had about 1213 14 to want to become warriors because any culture that
[54:29.160 --> 54:33.280]  didn't have strong young men that were ready to fight got overrun enslaved and
[54:33.280 --> 54:38.840]  exterminated so humans across the board are ready to fight in fact they get us
[54:38.840 --> 54:43.240]  kind of an artificial cowardice by by young people never actually having
[54:43.240 --> 54:49.080]  conflict it's actually important that young people get in controlled things
[54:49.080 --> 54:54.760]  like boxing and good old fastened schoolyard brawls because it teaches you
[54:54.760 --> 55:00.440]  by increments when you're 10 11 12 13 14 pretty soon you start getting hurt real
[55:00.440 --> 55:06.280]  bad you learn how to not get in fights unless you absolutely have to but then
[55:06.280 --> 55:11.160]  you also have confidence and you're not a coward with real power comes control
[55:11.160 --> 55:14.880]  instead you've got arrested development people that don't even really know how
[55:14.880 --> 55:19.040]  to fight and so they listen to stuff all day that's about how I killed this guy
[55:19.040 --> 55:23.600]  killed that guy they think that's what a man does they get a gun they go out and
[55:23.600 --> 55:27.440]  kill somebody or they go to rob houses because that's what's cool you know
[55:27.440 --> 55:31.840]  young white girls it's a bit it's a big fun thing black kids Hispanics you name
[55:31.840 --> 55:35.520]  it it's gangster culture and people get shot all the time and now they're
[55:35.520 --> 55:39.520]  trying to indict homeowners when one guy shot this teenage girl robbing his
[55:39.520 --> 55:43.160]  house and she laughed at him that's how delusional they are so he shot her
[55:43.160 --> 55:47.200]  again and then he admitted at the cops they go we're gonna arrest you then you
[55:47.200 --> 55:51.520]  shouldn't have shot this girl robbing you the point is is that there's a real
[55:51.520 --> 55:59.520]  world out there and even even if you have to defend yourself it's a very
[55:59.520 --> 56:04.160]  serious situation not just out looking for trouble all day but that's what the
[56:04.160 --> 56:10.080]  punk culture does and nine times out of ten punk start something and then
[56:10.080 --> 56:14.480]  once you're ready to deliver then they back off they want the symbol of the
[56:14.480 --> 56:18.120]  power but I read all the time about people being beaten to death in these
[56:18.120 --> 56:23.600]  in these brawls it's not just guns doing it and it's because society's
[56:23.600 --> 56:30.000]  degenerating we need more guns and the gun culture is really starting to
[56:30.000 --> 56:36.120]  spread and and that's why they want to brand it as the gangster culture no the
[56:36.120 --> 56:41.640]  gun culture is Americana rugged individualism take care of yourself don't
[56:41.640 --> 56:44.320]  point a gun at somebody unless you're getting ready to use it to defend
[56:44.320 --> 56:49.640]  yourself don't use a gun offensively use it defensively hey guns I'm
[56:49.640 --> 56:54.400]  absolutely programmed from training since age four I don't aim something at
[56:54.400 --> 56:57.360]  you unless I'm gonna pull the trigger I don't aim something at you unless you're
[56:57.360 --> 57:03.000]  invading my house and threatening me your or or if you have a if you have by
[57:03.000 --> 57:05.840]  the way I think I can take care of myself in most fights but if I have to be
[57:05.840 --> 57:10.960]  around a firearm and you attack me for no reason I'm just gonna go ahead because
[57:10.960 --> 57:15.080]  you could kill me I'm just gonna go ahead and defend myself with lethal force I
[57:15.080 --> 57:20.640]  mean it's that simple I'm not playing games with people okay and I'm not
[57:20.640 --> 57:24.960]  looking to kill somebody to feel manly and big either you understand that but
[57:24.960 --> 57:29.520]  but I'm looking to live here you see I'm a real nice sweet guy that rocks my
[57:29.520 --> 57:34.480]  little babies sleep at night that's because I have love that I'm ready to
[57:34.480 --> 57:39.340]  kill to protect my family understand that not because I'm a tough guy it's
[57:39.340 --> 57:43.560]  because I got a life force I'm here to live I'm here to thrive I'm here to build
[57:43.560 --> 57:48.520]  I'm here to lift humanity and we've been taught that civilization means you're
[57:48.520 --> 57:52.760]  you're a I don't want to say a feminine because it's an insult to women you are
[57:52.760 --> 57:57.040]  domesticated weak limp-risted men and women and people are discovering
[57:57.040 --> 58:02.200]  empowerment they are discovering how good it is and and and and liberty is
[58:02.200 --> 58:06.920]  being reborn that's why they banned dodgeball and then jogging and wrestling
[58:06.920 --> 58:09.760]  that's why they're trying to ban competitive sports now they're trying to
[58:09.760 --> 58:15.500]  ban boxing they're trying to ban in mixed martial arts you know there's big
[58:15.500 --> 58:19.400]  calls for that with the same crowd that runs mothers against drunk driving they
[58:19.400 --> 58:23.640]  want us domesticated where the elites have specialized killers and we all
[58:23.640 --> 58:29.360]  just sit here and take it no if you want freedom if you want love you better
[58:29.360 --> 58:34.440]  get ready to defend it physically because a nation of sheep will be ruled
[58:34.440 --> 58:45.280]  by wolves I'm Alex Jones in four wars the com this is GCN the Genesis

[01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:49.120]  three or four years before it's due they they say we wanted all this month the
[01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:53.640]  mega banks create all the fiat out of nothing they want you to go bankrupt now
[01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:58.880]  joining us and I got a lot of other news coming up is Pastor Lindsey Williams
[01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:03.040]  back in the 80s he wrote the bestseller the energy non-crisis saying there was
[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:08.440]  unlimited oil in Alaska more than Saudi Arabia then they made a deal with the
[01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:15.840]  Arabs in the 1970s it was all later declassified in the 90s to to to not
[01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:20.040]  allow development here in the United States basically and to as long as the
[01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:26.820]  Arabs did all their oil trading of the dollar to submit it as kind of a
[01:14:26.820 --> 01:14:30.760]  Bretton Woods to they claim Bretton Woods to a few years ago but this was
[01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:34.160]  the real Bretton Woods to to submit the dollar as the World Reserve currency
[01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:41.200]  now he called it five years ago five and a half years ago he said oil will go
[01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:45.040]  from $60 a barrel to 150 in the next year did everybody laughed it did
[01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:49.280]  exactly that then he said now we'll drop from 149 to 40 it actually went to about
[01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:54.480]  38 everybody laughed at that it happened I know who his big oil company exec
[01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:57.240]  people are one of them has been announced now he died of cancer a year and a half
[01:14:57.240 --> 01:15:06.120]  ago the other I know who it is Dr. Stan Monte found out who it was called the
[01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:09.720]  guy the guy said yes that's true but I'm not gonna talk to you now the point is
[01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:14.200]  these guys also could you know could be wrong sometimes because even though
[01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:17.360]  they're high-level globalist I don't just go everything they say and I don't
[01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:22.640]  completely trust them and you know they said they've said some things too that
[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:25.560]  haven't happened exactly right now when I want Lindsay to you know correct me if
[01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:28.960]  I'm wrong here Lindsay you did say about two years ago there'd be giant
[01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:33.280]  discoveries that we know we're already there all over the US a new oil boom
[01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:37.280]  that we would become independent and double-cross the Arabs now things change
[01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:41.280]  as you said now Obama's kind of been trying to double-cross the oil groups
[01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:47.640]  for the Arabs but that's all a way to rope-adult the Arabs I believe but you
[01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:52.800]  know you're saying the dollar will die by the end of this year well here we are
[01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:56.040]  and then I talked to a lot of other insiders and see the news that they're
[01:15:56.040 --> 01:15:59.680]  gonna go ahead and energy develop as a way to try to keep the dollar propped up
[01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:03.520]  and extend this out so they can pick winners and losers now this is a very
[01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:08.320]  complex issue I know you're chomping at the bit to talk but I know you haven't
[01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:11.280]  been on the air in over a month because you've got a lot of new information but
[01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:14.920]  just in it you don't thank me for coming on either you we appreciate you for
[01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:19.880]  coming on but in a nutshell what is happening what is going to happen and
[01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:24.200]  have I mean has your source been wrong about anything your sources or am I
[01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:30.320]  misinterpreting some of this after the election Alex I contacted my elite
[01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:35.120]  friend whom you just mentioned whom you know and I asked him the question what
[01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:41.520]  can we expect for the next four years the reply I got the only way I know to
[01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:45.600]  describe it is the most sparkling thing that any person has ever heard since
[01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:52.000]  the founding of the United States of America I was given 10 agendas that the
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:57.840]  American people will face in the next four years time it took me three hours
[01:16:57.840 --> 01:17:04.480]  and 29 minutes to explain this on DVD just to be able to tell what this man
[01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:09.960]  had told me now I have all 10 of those agendas in front of me we'll do the best
[01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:13.960]  we can today to cover them people positively must know what they are and
[01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:18.000]  you must know what to do about it well I'll say this about 90% of what these
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:24.640]  guys have told you has been starting started startlingly accurate but then
[01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:28.480]  why are they telling you this info and then some of it has not happened like
[01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:34.240]  they said like you know Obama isn't gonna win and things like that well they
[01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:38.640]  didn't say that Obama was not going to win and this is what people misinterpret
[01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:43.080]  what the elite have told me the elite told me that they did not want Obama
[01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:48.200]  back in but as you stated a moment ago these elite are not God they just think
[01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:54.400]  they are now they have 10 agendas that they have given me that will be carried
[01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:59.520]  out some of them are theirs some of them Mr. Obama's and some of them are the and
[01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:02.920]  you're going to hear some expressions today you've never heard before I'm
[01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:07.200]  going to give you some buzzwords and you watch them happen over four years there
[01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:11.320]  is a renegade elite out there and I'll attempt to explain it depending on how
[01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:17.840]  much time we have today let me just give you some of the agendas okay I want to do
[01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:20.560]  that and I'm gonna skip this network break I really shouldn't do it I'm gonna
[01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:23.640]  skip it because I went to a little bit late here and Max Kaiser is coming up
[01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:27.000]  the next hour at five after but just listen for just a moment answer my
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:30.600]  first question though because I mean I hope they're wrong or I hope they've
[01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:34.440]  changed their plan I mean I know you they told you things that did come true
[01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:38.840]  that showed total inside control like the fuel things like that the housing
[01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:41.960]  market would be crashed you know two years before it happened exactly how
[01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:46.640]  it would be done all of that what I'm asking you here is Lindsay Williams
[01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:51.320]  Pastor Williams I'm asking you this are they still planning to kill the dollar
[01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:57.320]  this year well that's exactly what they told me but it had me put it in their
[01:18:57.320 --> 01:19:02.880]  terms so that I don't miss interpret what their intentions are there will not
[01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:10.160]  be a collapse yet the elite do not want a collapse and I think Ron Paul but not
[01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:16.280]  yet now it is going to happen but not yet now you remember last year Alex you
[01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:19.880]  came to me and I went to my elite friend and I said is there going to be a
[01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:23.200]  collapse in the next three months and he laughed and said no and I came back on
[01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:26.880]  your show and told it all the other news a lot of writers were saying there was
[01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:30.520]  going to be a collapse when Greece collapsed and all the rest I'm telling
[01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:35.360]  you right now and I'll give them to you quickly that the elite do not want a
[01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:41.760]  collapse yet they have not created enough debt secondly please understand these
[01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:48.120]  words the second agenda the first debt creation I hope you're hearing these
[01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:52.600]  words and I'll attempt to explain it in detail if I can there is going to be
[01:19:52.600 --> 01:20:00.160]  first debt creation next the middle class I was horrified when I heard what
[01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:04.600]  they said that they are genders off of the middle class you hearing all of this
[01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:09.800]  Tommy Ross about taxing the rich don't you pay an ounce of attention to it oh
[01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:15.080]  sure the rich you're going to be a tax a little bit you haven't seen anything yet
[01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:21.040]  the middle class of America is going to be taxed into oblivion and I'm going to
[01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:24.640]  give you the details of it no that's no that's actually in the Republican and
[01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:28.000]  Democratic plan they're going to get rid of all the exemptions and tax all the
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:31.720]  middle class 401ks it's all being announced they're going to tax the
[01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:36.760]  dividends they're going to tax it all it is outrageous and and the and and the
[01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:43.120]  Republicans are going along with it Alex I have been given a formula I'm
[01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:47.240]  going to give it on your your program today if we have the time I've been
[01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:54.280]  given a devaluation formula so that you can know when the dollar is going to
[01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:58.560]  collapse now that's right you heard me correctly I have the formula right here
[01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:04.280]  before me exactly as my friend has given it to me again the debt limit is going
[01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:09.880]  to be suspended mark my words you are going to see as a result of this some
[01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:15.960]  very unusual things happen in America again the dollar will be phased out over
[01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:21.520]  the next four years did you hear me say over the next four years this is not
[01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:26.440]  going to take place instantaneous well that's what I've always said okay that's
[01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:30.000]  what I always said that well then why did the former oil company CEO one of
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:35.120]  the big three why did he tell you that it would that that the implosion would
[01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:41.640]  be signaled by December has there been a change of plan or was he trying to
[01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:46.960]  manipulate the markets no change in plan whatsoever you heard me say that the
[01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:51.680]  elite had told me that the dollar would be dead by the end of 2012 and if you
[01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:54.960]  give me enough time on your program today I'm going to prove to you that the
[01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:59.280]  dollars already did I'm going to give you the exact words that they said you're
[01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:02.120]  right they've already well that's what I've been saying why there's already a
[01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:04.960]  war with Iran there's already a war with Syrian people are like where's the war
[01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:09.640]  they're already moving to sdr's to back up the derivatives above the dollar and
[01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:13.680]  are already moving to a basket China and the bricks and others are leaving the
[01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:18.200]  dollar they're going into gold I agree that the rush to the exits is about to
[01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:22.920]  start but at the same time if people are getting up now the rush is about to
[01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:27.520]  start I didn't see it in my experts which I go with a wide spectrum of
[01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:33.080]  experts you know they said it would be a long decline but but then I guess that's
[01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:36.680]  what they meant with their riddle then you're saying that the dollar would be
[01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:41.120]  dead by the end of 2012 the dollar is dead it's already dead right now the
[01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:45.200]  American people the chickens just haven't come home to roost and the American
[01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:49.000]  people don't realize what the rest okay come on so it's like sparking wrath of
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:52.440]  con he's been radiated and they say don't go in and try to save him he's dead
[01:22:52.440 --> 01:22:56.720]  already he just hadn't physically died yet okay let me give you an example this
[01:22:56.720 --> 01:23:01.400]  happened last week you heard about it it was on the national news you know what
[01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:05.880]  happened in Phnom Penh 15 Asian nations comprising half of the world's
[01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:10.640]  population and they met together in what they call the regional comprehensive
[01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:15.480]  economic partnership and the United States of America was excluded our
[01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:19.920]  president went over there to attend the summit now this is an association of
[01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:27.960]  China India South Korea Australian New Zealand 3 billion Asians one half of the
[01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:32.160]  population of the world and they said we're not going to use the American
[01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:35.760]  dollar anymore for the sale and trade of our products amongst ourselves
[01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:42.000]  Americans what you don't realize is the dollar is already dead and these
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:45.840]  trillions and trillions of American dollars are floating around out there
[01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:51.640]  unwanted unused and you you say oh with chaplain I can go to the grocery store
[01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:56.520]  and I can do by groceries the dollar okay I'm glad you can today you better
[01:23:56.520 --> 01:24:01.120]  buy old you can get in that cart because when things like this when I'm in and
[01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:04.720]  what happened with bricks when they met together and said we aren't going to use
[01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:09.520]  the American dollar any longer the dollar I tell you is exactly what the elite
[01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:15.480]  told me back a year ago the dollar is already dead and 69 months from now when
[01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:20.280]  these trillions of unused dollars come home it is going to be massive chaos in
[01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:24.480]  this country with the dollar like you've never seen before Alex you need to
[01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:29.320]  understand the total program of the elite as they've given it to me so that
[01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:35.640]  you can comprehend what these people are doing well no I agree with what you're
[01:24:35.640 --> 01:24:39.520]  saying and I also monitor the CNBC and others where they give you a lot of spin
[01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:44.800]  but they also want to cover their bases with irrational exuberance type
[01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:49.160]  statements when their controllers are the authors of the irrational exuberance
[01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:53.600]  they want to warn you right before they draw the trap once it's already too late
[01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:57.800]  they're saying now there's no way we're going to get out of some moderate
[01:24:57.800 --> 01:25:03.680]  inflation get ready for it inflation is already rampant in so many sectors they
[01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:08.320]  just make the bag of chips smaller the bag of tides smaller they make the meat
[01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:13.520]  thinner they make the packaging different everything is exploding in
[01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:22.520]  prices year after year after year Alex there are some you know I don't know how
[01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:26.560]  to say this there's so many factors here I've got to cover there are some new
[01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:30.280]  factions out there right now that nobody's ever heard about you you haven't
[01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:34.640]  even heard about it Alex I please forgive me you hear about everything but no
[01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:38.440]  news water has come out with this if I had not been for my elite friend telling
[01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:45.640]  me and I'm going to run through your 10 bullet points the tenders of the elite
[01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:49.520]  okay run through the tan just list them and then go back into I think that's the
[01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:52.960]  way to go well that's what I've been doing right here I said there's not going
[01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:56.960]  to be a collapse yet the elite are not ready for it there's going to be fullest
[01:25:56.960 --> 01:26:01.080]  the debt creation I hope you've caught that the middle class is going to be
[01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:06.280]  taxed into oblivion folks you have got to know the intricate details of this the
[01:26:06.280 --> 01:26:11.200]  devaluation formula I've been given it to you you can know when you hear it
[01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:15.160]  from me as the elite gave it to me you can know where you are in the
[01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:18.960]  devaluation of the dollar the debt limit will be suspended the dollar will be
[01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:23.840]  phased out I'm giving you these one at a time the dollar will be phased out and I
[01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:28.320]  have the details as to how they're going to do it there's new factions out there
[01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:32.600]  that you've never heard about before again this one I hope you find very
[01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:37.280]  startling there will never be another honest election in the United States of
[01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:42.480]  America it's already planned it is part of the agenda of the elite I have been
[01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:47.600]  told where gold prices are going to go by the end of 2016 they've given me the
[01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:53.120]  figures on it and and Alex I think probably you know I'm not being a
[01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:55.960]  minister all these years I think probably one of the most startling things
[01:26:55.960 --> 01:27:00.720]  I've heard from my elite friend is the agenda of the Devil's Messiah program
[01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:04.960]  which you've heard me talk about on your program before but for the next four
[01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:09.800]  years the agenda of that Devil's Messiah program will almost curl your
[01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:15.600]  toenails again there are millions of Muslims that will be brought into the
[01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:20.160]  United States of America and made citizens over the next four years and
[01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:24.800]  then when they told me about what's going to happen to the medical system the
[01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:30.680]  last item is you must become your own doctor and become that own doctor quick
[01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:35.880]  and know how to do it Alex Wow you know what I actually have in my stack and
[01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:41.440]  was going to try to get to it today where no one they're saying it's not even
[01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:45.640]  one-tenth the number of people that wanted to go see Obama's first coronation
[01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:51.400]  four years ago and that no one wants to go and I'm not saying Mitt Romney was
[01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:55.080]  good he was owned by the same people but obviously they wanted to put Obama back
[01:27:55.080 --> 01:27:58.680]  in because he was the more effective evil not the lesser of two evils but
[01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:02.840]  the more effective of two evils as Cynthia McKinney said last week former
[01:28:02.840 --> 01:28:08.040]  congresswoman on the show but clearly Beth Harris the top election fraud
[01:28:08.040 --> 01:28:13.000]  expert been a Democrat said you know the evidence is they pretty much stole the
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:16.680]  election for Obama and and that's what you see now they're gonna go to full
[01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:21.280]  fraud and just say oh this gives us a mandate to take your guns he got
[01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:25.520]  reelected this gives us a mandate to raise your taxes they are calmly
[01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:31.080]  announcing giant taxes on basically all mutual funds stock investments
[01:28:31.080 --> 01:28:36.640]  portfolios 401ks that are invested in that I mean this is this is this is off
[01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:42.280]  the charts and it backs up everything you're saying and and it's just over
[01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:47.120]  they're taking over unless we fully realize it Alex you're exactly right
[01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:51.600]  now let me go into some of these one by one because people you positively must
[01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:56.400]  know the solution to all of this and as when I got through producing that three
[01:28:56.400 --> 01:29:04.280]  hour and 25 29 minutes of DVDs I was horrified well we're going to break
[01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:08.120]  here and we're gonna plug that as well because I know it's serious to let
[01:29:08.120 --> 01:29:12.360]  people know what I had to do I had no choice I could not morally I could not
[01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:16.840]  conscientiously we produced a second DVD series that they both go together
[01:29:16.840 --> 01:29:22.520]  entitled how to survive the next four years and it's over two hours long now
[01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:25.800]  let me go into the agenda's a little we are we are and I'm also gonna tell them
[01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:29.800]  where to get that obviously prophecyclub.com folks and he only does this
[01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:32.560]  every once in a while when he gets a bunch of info and I mean they he said
[01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:38.320]  well we'll go to 150 or by last went to it now it's gonna go down to 40 happened
[01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:44.800]  they're gonna plunge the stock market and you know all of it with accuracy and I
[01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:49.120]  hope he's wrong this time but we'll go through his sources Intel straight ahead
[01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:56.040]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio

[01:34:20.040 --> 01:34:25.680]  died of cancer over a year ago the other again gives him this info because I
[01:34:25.680 --> 01:34:28.960]  guess they kind of want to have a remnant out there that knows what's
[01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:33.200]  going on or it's guilt I think that's basically what we've gotten from Lindsay
[01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:37.800]  but it doesn't mean that it's all going to be a hundred percent accurate but but
[01:34:37.800 --> 01:34:41.240]  it's been startingly accurate on so many fronts we're gonna go back to him in a
[01:34:41.240 --> 01:34:47.240]  moment and he has produced a new DVD breakdown that's why I wouldn't come on

[01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:31.200]  have ever given this information on now I do three other shows later in the day
[01:38:31.200 --> 01:38:35.920]  today this is the first show that anybody has ever heard this information
[01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:39.880]  now let me try to take them one at a time I'll only be able to cover two or
[01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:44.240]  three of them first of all you heard me say a moment ago there's not going to
[01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:48.960]  be a collapse yet let me try to explain why the elite is they've explained it to
[01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:55.280]  me have not created enough debt yet they want such massive debt created that
[01:38:55.280 --> 01:39:01.560]  every country every state every city every individual in the world is in such
[01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:06.160]  debt now I want to give you an expression that you want to watch this
[01:39:06.160 --> 01:39:10.800]  happen you won't hear this unless you don't want to be elite first debt
[01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:16.880]  creation they are going to force that on not only countries not only on the
[01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:21.720]  United States of America states and cities in this country but watch let's
[01:39:21.720 --> 01:39:26.160]  try to give an example right here you remember years ago I got an America
[01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:31.800]  Express credit card back 30 40 years ago and America Express back then was
[01:39:31.800 --> 01:39:37.040]  nothing but a credit card company last year America Express was forced into
[01:39:37.040 --> 01:39:42.880]  becoming a bank no longer a credit card company at all this is part of what I'm
[01:39:42.880 --> 01:39:48.840]  trying to explain to you that the elite are going to force debt creation they
[01:39:48.840 --> 01:39:53.400]  force them to become a bank then they turned around on the QE one and QE two
[01:39:53.400 --> 01:39:59.160]  and they took over the banks basically for all practical purposes and made them
[01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:03.400]  so in debt because the amount of the money that they gave them until they
[01:40:03.400 --> 01:40:08.680]  forced them into debt creation now watch what's happening to the students of
[01:40:08.680 --> 01:40:12.560]  America you've heard a lot about this lately they have the economy to the
[01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:16.240]  point that a person cannot afford to go to college and do it like I did it years
[01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:20.240]  ago I worked my way through college bagging groceries working here and
[01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:24.400]  yon every place I could you can't do that anymore they have convinced the
[01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:28.200]  students now that they must borrow money from the government and get students
[01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:33.720]  loans this this is the most dastardly thing you can imagine off they've
[01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:37.760]  created in the minds of the students that they've got to have these loans and
[01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:42.640]  it is done intentionally they took it out of the hands of private individuals
[01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:48.200]  and institutions and the government now is handling it they want those students
[01:40:48.200 --> 01:40:52.680]  to be so in debt when they come out of college that they under are under the
[01:40:52.680 --> 01:40:56.200]  total control of the government and eventually we'll be able to go into
[01:40:56.200 --> 01:41:02.080]  bankruptcy and every bit of this is a part of the agenda of those debt
[01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:08.760]  creation now this physical cliff you're hearing about right now it's the biggest
[01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:13.440]  bag of wind I think I've ever heard in my life it is not what they are
[01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:18.840]  projecting it to be at all this physical cliff so my old friend has told me is a
[01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:24.640]  well I can't show you catching this it is a part of the debt creation that they
[01:41:24.640 --> 01:41:30.040]  wished and they're using the physical cliff words in order to get into your
[01:41:30.040 --> 01:41:34.480]  mind something that they want you to think but on the backside of all of this
[01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:40.000]  is debt creation that is almost unbelievable in the same thing three
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:44.080]  times in Europe the last four years it's to terrorize you into accepting new
[01:41:44.080 --> 01:41:50.800]  taxes exactly right they again please let me express to you the elite do not
[01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:56.040]  want a collapse right now and it may not take place for the next two years it
[01:41:56.040 --> 01:42:00.120]  may not take place for the next three years it is going to happen within this
[01:42:00.120 --> 01:42:06.000]  four-year period but in order to bring in the new world order the way that they
[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:09.920]  want it they have got to force I hope you're catching this word I didn't say
[01:42:09.920 --> 01:42:15.560]  debt creation I said forced debt creation in order to be able to create the
[01:42:15.560 --> 01:42:18.760]  atmosphere that they want of your acceptance of the new world that's why
[01:42:18.760 --> 01:42:22.760]  they make you buy health care even though it bankrupts you to go into debt
[01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:26.720]  they're going to make you do everything if they can't make you go on welfare
[01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:31.200]  they're going to make you go under their system one way or the other middle class
[01:42:31.200 --> 01:42:36.440]  please oh goodness folks you've got to know what they have plans for you the
[01:42:36.440 --> 01:42:41.960]  middle class now all you've heard is about the rich taxa rich taxa rich come
[01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:47.480]  on give me a break this is nothing but a smoke screen they are going to tax the
[01:42:47.480 --> 01:42:52.880]  middle class American into oblivion are you catching this now watch it I don't
[01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:56.840]  know what kind of a tax they're going to put on you but you want mark my words
[01:42:56.840 --> 01:43:03.080]  before this physical cliff thing is over you will you have in front of your eyes
[01:43:03.080 --> 01:43:07.320]  one of the most horrifying situation that you've ever imagined in your life
[01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:12.680]  because they are only getting your mind ready for a tax a number of different
[01:43:12.680 --> 01:43:17.440]  taxes number one you may have a module minimum tax it's been suggested you may
[01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:24.120]  have a national sales tax you may you already have an Obamacare tax you see
[01:43:24.120 --> 01:43:29.400]  that they couldn't say you've got to a bio Obamacare but they could come along
[01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:34.240]  and say we're going to tax you for Obamacare and then this is a part of the
[01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:41.200]  debt creation 3.8 tax on all investments on pension funds you name it and that
[01:43:41.200 --> 01:43:44.200]  begins the takeover of those that's Washington Post today that's the
[01:43:44.200 --> 01:43:49.160]  Republican proposal and then that scene is the conservative proposal that's how
[01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:54.240]  they bait and switch people I'm just backing up what you're saying here
[01:43:54.240 --> 01:43:59.120]  they're eliminating 600 billion in deductions 960 billion in tax increases
[01:43:59.120 --> 01:44:05.320]  and all that money most of that money goes to the mega elite in banker bailouts
[01:44:05.320 --> 01:44:11.120]  and they're going to tax savings they're going to tax everything I mean this is
[01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:16.280]  just amazing you you don't pay any attention to this business about tax
[01:44:16.280 --> 01:44:23.120]  the rich it is a slide line you middle-class Americans you have never
[01:44:23.120 --> 01:44:29.040]  seen anything now and this is for the purpose of the and you heard me say a
[01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:33.000]  few moments ago that I've already been given a formula as to when you can know
[01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:37.800]  that the dollar's going to collapse and they're working up to this point of that
[01:44:37.800 --> 01:44:40.520]  formula which I'll give you in a few moments hopefully I have time to give
[01:44:40.520 --> 01:44:44.000]  me okay let me go back to the middle class you heard what Wal-Mart did on
[01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:48.680]  yesterday number one retailer in the United States of America in the Obamacare
[01:44:48.680 --> 01:44:54.760]  program it says that if any person has under 30 hours of work per week that they
[01:44:54.760 --> 01:44:59.360]  don't fall under the auspices of Wal-Mart having to pay for Obamacare for them
[01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:05.840]  you folks have killed yourself you can't imagine how you should have rebelled
[01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:11.280]  against this do you realize that nothing but management personnel of Wal-Mart are
[01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:15.920]  going to have jobs of 30 hours and more per week from this point on and
[01:45:15.920 --> 01:45:19.480]  everybody else will be considered part-time help so that they don't have
[01:45:19.480 --> 01:45:24.520]  to pay for Obamacare but that didn't happen by chance people oh my goodness I
[01:45:24.520 --> 01:45:29.000]  wish I could get you to see it this is happening by design which I was told
[01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:34.920]  three weeks ago my my elite friend when he told me ten agendas that every
[01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:40.200]  American in this country will face and when Matt Wal-Mart cuts down to 30
[01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:44.640]  hours or less with all of those thousands and thousands of employees do
[01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:48.760]  you realize that it is going to put every one of them into such massive debt
[01:45:48.760 --> 01:45:54.280]  that they are going to say oh government please give us a food stamp give us some
[01:45:54.280 --> 01:46:00.600]  welfare give us a new currency give us a new constitution people do you see what
[01:46:00.600 --> 01:46:04.880]  is happening to you this massive they've doubled the food stamps from 25 million
[01:46:04.880 --> 01:46:09.480]  to close to 50 million in four years this is the domestication the share
[01:46:09.480 --> 01:46:14.200]  cropper oh you're sold to the company store total takeover get into that
[01:46:14.200 --> 01:46:19.480]  formula you were talking about okay here we go please I hope you've got pencil
[01:46:19.480 --> 01:46:23.720]  from paper there and you'll hear it explained in detail in my new DVD series
[01:46:23.720 --> 01:46:29.240]  here's a formula you remember that went all back on Bernanke announced that the
[01:46:29.240 --> 01:46:33.400]  Federal Reserve was going to purchase 40 billion dollars per month of mortgage
[01:46:33.400 --> 01:46:37.960]  back securities and of course I came out all over America and told people what
[01:46:37.960 --> 01:46:41.320]  was going to happen but then my elite friend gave me just the other day and
[01:46:41.320 --> 01:46:47.920]  now I can see through it just as plain as day what happened as off every month
[01:46:47.920 --> 01:46:52.800]  every single month that the bed buys 40 billion dollars worth of mortgage back
[01:46:52.800 --> 01:47:00.240]  securities it's automatically devalues the dollar between four between three and
[01:47:00.240 --> 01:47:04.280]  four percent that you catch this put it down on your paper it's automatically
[01:47:04.280 --> 01:47:09.360]  devalues the dollar by three to four percent now take four percent and start
[01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:13.920]  come on use your calculator take that four percent and go every month of the
[01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:19.200]  year for one year two years three years four years and then tell me how much
[01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:23.760]  money you've got left at the end of the week okay you must put food on the
[01:47:23.760 --> 01:47:29.160]  table you positively have to put gas in that gas tank and then you're going to
[01:47:29.160 --> 01:47:33.280]  have to put clothes on the back of children and food on the table now at
[01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:38.840]  percent devaluation of the dollar per month how long is it going to take before
[01:47:38.840 --> 01:47:43.760]  the dollar has such a small purchasing power that you can no longer pay the
[01:47:43.760 --> 01:47:47.640]  house mortgage and this is what they want they don't want you to be able to
[01:47:47.640 --> 01:47:52.000]  pay that house mortgage because the day you can't the Federal Reserve who has
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:55.280]  already bought that mortgage back security is going to come in and
[01:47:55.280 --> 01:47:59.960]  repossess it they are the elite who want to bring in the new world order and
[01:47:59.960 --> 01:48:04.480]  they will own every piece of real estate mortgage real estate in the United
[01:48:04.480 --> 01:48:07.400]  States of America now add something on to that come on let's do this through
[01:48:07.400 --> 01:48:12.240]  some math here three to four percent per month automatic devaluation so slow that
[01:48:12.240 --> 01:48:16.280]  you'd be like a frog boiling in the pot you'll accept it I hope you don't accept
[01:48:16.280 --> 01:48:21.400]  it number two add the new taxes on to that you heard me say the middle class
[01:48:21.400 --> 01:48:25.440]  is going to be taxed into oblivion you're going to see either a national
[01:48:25.440 --> 01:48:30.000]  sales tax a marginal minimum tax you're going to obama cares already come in
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:34.440]  okay add something else on to that add on obama care you haven't had to pay that
[01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:38.200]  before okay see what you've got so far you've got four percent per month
[01:48:38.200 --> 01:48:43.360]  devaluation you've got massive amounts of new tax that you this four percent
[01:48:43.360 --> 01:48:47.760]  obama care you gotta buy the obama it just goes on and on yep you're just
[01:48:47.760 --> 01:48:51.880]  adding it all up yeah yeah now obama care comes in that's going to be a new
[01:48:51.880 --> 01:48:57.280]  tax and it is a tax the supreme court declared it next put out an increased
[01:48:57.280 --> 01:49:03.360]  food prices you've got to factor these things in then you take a 30-hour only
[01:49:03.360 --> 01:49:09.280]  work week for everybody except the managing personnel of every wave on
[01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:15.280]  target every fast food restaurant in the country is going to cut back and have
[01:49:15.280 --> 01:49:21.240]  more employees with less than 30 hours of work week and you add that in the fact
[01:49:21.240 --> 01:49:25.480]  that you can't make 40 to 50 hours per week now without having three or four
[01:49:25.480 --> 01:49:30.520]  or five jobs then you've got the feds 40 billion dollars per month that the
[01:49:30.520 --> 01:49:35.160]  Federal Reserve is going to buy mortgage back securities you factor in every one
[01:49:35.160 --> 01:49:40.360]  of those things and add them up please you've got to do it you must and at that
[01:49:40.360 --> 01:49:45.240]  point you will know how long it will be before they have created such massive
[01:49:45.240 --> 01:49:50.080]  debt in your house that you cannot afford to make the house mortgage payment and
[01:49:50.080 --> 01:49:55.960]  that is what they want it is totally economic warfare we are going into
[01:49:55.960 --> 01:49:59.560]  absolute bondage and everything you're saying is right here in the Washington
[01:49:59.560 --> 01:50:04.000]  Post they just released it today that the Republican plan that's about half the
[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:09.000]  taxes that Obama wants is a devastating nine hundred and sixty billion dollar
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:13.720]  middle-class tax increase elimination of deductions six hundred building six
[01:50:13.720 --> 01:50:18.760]  hundred billion four hundred billion in spending cuts and then it just goes on
[01:50:18.760 --> 01:50:24.680]  getting rid of all the deductions three point eight percent Obamacare tax not
[01:50:24.680 --> 01:50:30.080]  counting having to buy the health care I mean this is going to devastate you're
[01:50:30.080 --> 01:50:35.840]  going to see probably 20 30 40 percent more go on welfare now this is it they're
[01:50:35.840 --> 01:50:39.680]  going to totally collapse this Lindsey how long will it take couple years well
[01:50:39.680 --> 01:50:44.120]  I had been given I'm so glad that you just brought up the welfare situation
[01:50:44.120 --> 01:50:48.560]  because what a person only gets 30 hours per week and no way in this world that
[01:50:48.560 --> 01:50:52.200]  they can afford an apartment no way they can afford a house an automobile
[01:50:52.200 --> 01:50:58.520]  they've cut back and I was just given how many people go stay there stay there
[01:50:58.520 --> 01:51:05.320]  we're gonna go there right now sodium fluoride in the body reduces IQ and
[01:51:05.320 --> 01:51:11.000]  increases cancers unfortunately fluoride and its derivatives are only one of

[01:54:59.440 --> 01:55:03.600]  churches they're bankrupting them making them government organs totally
[01:55:03.600 --> 01:55:08.120]  unconstitutional tell us about that debt limit is going to be suspended this is
[01:55:08.120 --> 01:55:13.200]  going to be devastating folks this is part of the debt creation again the
[01:55:13.200 --> 01:55:18.520]  dollar will be phased out over the next four years very gradually and you can
[01:55:18.520 --> 01:55:23.160]  not let them do it you've got to start some sort of movement before then there's
[01:55:23.160 --> 01:55:28.120]  new factions I wish to goodness you would know about yeah cover the cover the
[01:55:28.120 --> 01:55:34.320]  factions I want to hear that cover the factions I can't I can't do it and even
[01:55:34.320 --> 01:55:38.800]  in 15 20 minutes of a breakdown some of the factions okay first of all there are
[01:55:38.800 --> 01:55:42.880]  three factions out there right now and nobody has the slightest idea about the
[01:55:42.880 --> 01:55:47.200]  number one there is the old-fashioned elite whom you and I have known for our
[01:55:47.200 --> 01:55:52.160]  entire lifetime again and please bear with me on this you've got to let me
[01:55:52.160 --> 01:55:56.760]  prove it Obama has double crossed the elite in his first administration three
[01:55:56.760 --> 01:56:01.400]  to four times and they are limited they realize that they have a bull in the
[01:56:01.400 --> 01:56:05.400]  china shop right now that is uncontrollable and since he's back in
[01:56:05.400 --> 01:56:09.480]  they realize that Obama has an agenda and I've been given some of those
[01:56:09.480 --> 01:56:14.800]  agendas again there is a renegade elite out there right now please this has
[01:56:14.800 --> 01:56:19.400]  never happened before in the history of the existence of the elite let me try to
[01:56:19.400 --> 01:56:24.000]  explain some of them first of all there is the Bricks group Brazil Russia
[01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:29.640]  India China and South Africa who comprise 43% of the world's population and
[01:56:29.640 --> 01:56:35.520]  18% of the world's GDP and 53% of the global financial capital and they have
[01:56:35.520 --> 01:56:39.360]  said we're not going to use the American dollar any longer they are becoming
[01:56:39.360 --> 01:56:45.920]  what the elite are calling a renegade elite and then came up from then last
[01:56:45.920 --> 01:56:51.240]  week when our president went over with 15 Asian nations comprising half of the
[01:56:51.240 --> 01:56:56.800]  world's population and made up China India Japan South Korea Australia New
[01:56:56.800 --> 01:57:02.920]  Zealand and 30 billion Asians and they have have signed an agreement saying we
[01:57:02.920 --> 01:57:06.280]  will not use the American now what's happening is they want to control the
[01:57:06.280 --> 01:57:11.480]  new world order okay and then the third group and well that is the third group
[01:57:11.480 --> 01:57:16.160]  there is the elite there is a old out of control president that the elite don't
[01:57:16.160 --> 01:57:19.360]  know what they're going to do with him they're having problems already then
[01:57:19.360 --> 01:57:23.440]  there's a renegade elite comprised of these different groups who have said
[01:57:23.440 --> 01:57:26.960]  we're not going to use the American dollar anymore and folks let me try to
[01:57:26.960 --> 01:57:30.520]  explain it well that's true I mean there's the old elite there's the old
[01:57:30.520 --> 01:57:35.520]  elite in the renegade well what's the third well there is the elite there is
[01:57:35.520 --> 01:57:40.520]  the Obama out of control and number three there's a renegade elite yeah but
[01:57:40.520 --> 01:57:44.040]  Obama's funded by JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs and doing exactly what the
[01:57:44.040 --> 01:57:48.880]  mega bank Rothschild Rockefeller power axis it's now publicly merged we always
[01:57:48.880 --> 01:57:52.200]  told you that was the power axis I mean he's their complete minion executing
[01:57:52.200 --> 01:57:56.600]  flawlessly but he's out of control he is doing many things that they didn't
[01:57:56.600 --> 01:58:00.360]  want during his last four years and they realize now that there are many things
[01:58:00.360 --> 01:58:04.360]  that he will do this time well he didn't open up a public lands to oil
[01:58:04.360 --> 01:58:09.960]  exploration and they are livid he didn't let the pipeline go across Canada and in
[01:58:09.960 --> 01:58:16.200]  favor of his Muslim brotherhood friends thirdly they put in the bill in
[01:58:16.200 --> 01:58:20.280]  Congress that controls a lot of the things that the elite do and it was
[01:58:20.280 --> 01:58:24.000]  mentioned by Ronnie Lindsey stay there we're gonna come back and jam in a few
[01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:30.160]  quick questions mark in Colorado is listening on KHNC 1360 a.m. and we've
[01:58:30.160 --> 01:58:32.520]  got a lot of other people there on hold I don't know they'll get to them all
[01:58:32.520 --> 01:58:36.120]  this Max Kaiser's coming up and I want to I don't want to cut him off but man
[01:58:36.120 --> 01:58:51.360]  there is just so much to cover here with Lindsey Williams have you ever wanted
[01:58:51.360 --> 01:58:54.720]  to generate your own supply of electrical power even save money on your
[01:58:54.720 --> 01:58:58.400]  electric bill if so this could be one of the most important messages you will
[01:58:58.400 --> 01:59:02.680]  ever hear solar power generators are now available these emergency backup
[01:59:02.680 --> 01:59:06.760]  systems provide life-saving electrical power unlike gas generators a solar
[01:59:06.760 --> 01:59:10.880]  generator runs quietly amidst no fumes and produces electricity from the Sun
[01:59:10.880 --> 01:59:14.560]  it's like having an electrical power plant running quietly in your own home

[02:03:01.360 --> 02:03:05.360]  go off the fiscal cliff right now on the charts as it's diving down today does
[02:03:05.360 --> 02:03:08.640]  Lindsay think that they're gonna try to manipulate that price lower so that the

[02:03:13.720 --> 02:03:17.040]  thing that we should be doing here as the middle class because you think that
[02:03:17.040 --> 02:03:20.160]  they're gonna be manipulating these prices so that they can in fact take
[02:03:20.160 --> 02:03:25.000]  advantage of this fiscal cliff and in turn also get profits from this
[02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:28.520]  financial bearer saw live in the woods thank you for the great question
[02:03:28.520 --> 02:03:33.440]  Lindsay yes don't pay any attention to the fact that it goes up and down from
[02:03:33.440 --> 02:03:37.880]  time to time they want to scare the average person out of it but I've been
[02:03:37.880 --> 02:03:43.560]  given the figure in 2016 you will have it up to three thousand dollars so don't

[02:04:07.600 --> 02:04:10.440]  just giving you what they're telling telling me you can't imagine the
[02:04:10.440 --> 02:04:14.120]  emails I've received from my elite friend talking about how the elite
[02:04:14.120 --> 02:04:18.160]  themselves especially the old-time elite are concerned about a president that is
[02:04:18.160 --> 02:04:22.840]  haughty arrogant thinks he has the tiger by the tail right now and is like a
[02:04:22.840 --> 02:04:26.800]  bull in the China shop completely out of control and even they don't know what
[02:04:26.800 --> 02:04:32.920]  to do with him in some instances but what do they fear from the people I mean
[02:04:32.920 --> 02:04:38.040]  you said it last time us getting organized and angry right the last thing
[02:04:38.040 --> 02:04:43.600]  in the world that they want is is civil war if the last thing they want is
[02:04:43.600 --> 02:04:47.160]  civil uprisings they want to bring in the new world order according to their
[02:04:47.160 --> 02:04:50.800]  plan they may not be able to do it but you don't know the hand that's what they
[02:04:50.800 --> 02:04:53.840]  want yeah that's why they don't like Obama because he's so communist and
[02:04:53.840 --> 02:04:57.760]  hates guns so much he may start a civil war trying to get the guns Lindsay we're

[02:08:20.240 --> 02:08:27.600]  well Fox Sports columnist that we've covered in the first hour has come out
[02:08:27.600 --> 02:08:33.520]  and said you are a member of the KKK here in the NRA or a gun owner and has
[02:08:33.520 --> 02:08:38.560]  called for the ban of firearms for the American people Bob Costas as you know
[02:08:38.560 --> 02:08:44.080]  then went and quoted him and said he quote agreed with everything that he
[02:08:44.080 --> 02:08:48.920]  had said and then read it word for word off of a teleprompter all of that news
[02:08:48.920 --> 02:08:55.680]  is up at infowars.com and prisonplot.com with the video and the audio of all of
[02:08:55.680 --> 02:09:02.560]  it and the establishment thinks you're so dumb that the Republicans have come
[02:09:02.560 --> 02:09:11.800]  out with 960 billion in tax increases on the middle class the 600 billion in
[02:09:11.800 --> 02:09:21.960]  deduction of the deductions and the Obamacare 3.8% tax on investments
[02:09:21.960 --> 02:09:29.200]  investments and that means you're 401k unbelievable and that's being called
[02:09:29.200 --> 02:09:33.360]  conservative that's the compromise Obama wants dictatorial power to have
[02:09:33.360 --> 02:09:36.160]  Congress just sound away the power of the purse to him when he's already
[02:09:36.160 --> 02:09:39.600]  operating like that on so many fronts they're all just complete fronts and
[02:09:39.600 --> 02:09:45.400]  here is Max Kaiser with his big front page in the mighty London independent
[02:09:45.400 --> 02:09:51.360]  Max Kaiser Barack Obama is clueless Mitt Romney will bankrupt the country and
[02:09:51.360 --> 02:09:57.120]  that's exactly what he's actually said back in November and he wants to talk
[02:09:57.120 --> 02:10:02.080]  some about this article but he he obviously predicted that Obama would be
[02:10:02.080 --> 02:10:06.880]  the winner but I mean to say that Obama is clueless and we know Max Max doesn't
[02:10:06.880 --> 02:10:14.200]  really really believe that and that's Robert Chambers or Calmers saying that
[02:10:14.200 --> 02:10:18.560]  so we're gonna get a former rebel now retired stockbroker top stockbroker
[02:10:18.560 --> 02:10:21.760]  inventor of the Hollywood Stock Exchange virtual trading specialist used on
[02:10:21.760 --> 02:10:24.920]  a lot of stock markets in the world today that really needs no introduction
[02:10:24.920 --> 02:10:30.120]  here but so much is going on here's interesting one McClatchy newspapers I
[02:10:30.120 --> 02:10:35.080]  just can't get over this headline al-Qaeda link group Syrian rebels once
[02:10:35.080 --> 02:10:40.680]  denied now key to anti Assad victories and they admit our government's giving
[02:10:40.680 --> 02:10:44.800]  service to air missiles to al-Qaeda that they're the groups making people suicide
[02:10:44.800 --> 02:10:49.240]  bomb or they kill their families and this is the height of morality now but
[02:10:49.240 --> 02:10:52.360]  I've got to get my rights up or al-Qaeda will kill me and here's some of the other
[02:10:52.360 --> 02:10:56.880]  news TSA seeks permission to conduct safety assessments on highways TSA is
[02:10:56.880 --> 02:11:00.760]  creating and maintaining a watch list of Americans who violate its policies
[02:11:00.760 --> 02:11:06.640]  breaking the whole Trayvon Martin situation now with the bloodied photos
[02:11:06.640 --> 02:11:09.120]  why did the media cover that up in the government because they want to get
[02:11:09.120 --> 02:11:13.360]  racial division in this country that is just some of what we've got and then
[02:11:13.360 --> 02:11:20.320]  dealing with the financial fiscal cliff that Max Kaiser has been talking about
[02:11:20.320 --> 02:11:24.720]  earlier I read the headlines out of England I'm looking for that article
[02:11:24.720 --> 02:11:30.400]  right now where the Bank of England had said this is like a world war it is so
[02:11:30.400 --> 02:11:35.200]  bad and basically said there's no way to pay things off here it is actually
[02:11:35.200 --> 02:11:40.480]  found that we can document cam shot this for TV viewers this is as bad as a
[02:11:40.480 --> 02:11:47.360]  world war Bank of England bosses grim view of financial crisis which has left
[02:11:47.360 --> 02:11:51.240]  a debt that will be paid by our grandchildren it's not meant to be paid
[02:11:51.240 --> 02:11:56.000]  it's mega banks putting out derivatives that the that we then back up with the
[02:11:56.000 --> 02:12:00.760]  Federal Reserve Europe's in the same thing 40 billion a month paid directly to
[02:12:00.760 --> 02:12:04.400]  the private shareholders of the Federal Reserve JP Morgan Chase Goldman Sachs
[02:12:04.400 --> 02:12:08.680]  and others and now we're hearing the head of JP Morgan Chase who ran
[02:12:08.680 --> 02:12:17.240]  disgusting ads during the football on Thanksgiving literally saying JP Morgan
[02:12:17.240 --> 02:12:20.840]  Chase brought you Thanksgiving and free markets when they're one of the biggest
[02:12:20.840 --> 02:12:24.640]  recipients of corporate welfare you can see their plan global banker
[02:12:24.640 --> 02:12:31.160]  occupation you can see it all now totally naked in our face and we have now
[02:12:31.160 --> 02:12:38.320]  entered the La La Land Max Kaiser where on earth are we going break down the
[02:12:38.320 --> 02:12:42.840]  points I've made because you've said that you believe by April that's now only
[02:12:42.840 --> 02:12:46.960]  three or four months away that it's gonna be clear that we're in a full bore
[02:12:46.960 --> 02:12:51.480]  collapse what is your overall take since you were on a month ago
[02:12:51.480 --> 02:12:58.200]  oh yeah five five months away to April am I holding to my prediction Alex Jones
[02:12:58.200 --> 02:13:06.640]  that you will have a catastrophic event and the question was what would be the
[02:13:06.640 --> 02:13:10.560]  trigger you know on this show your show we talk about the potential trigger
[02:13:10.560 --> 02:13:15.840]  points and one that I mentioned a couple of months ago which is now on the radar
[02:13:15.840 --> 02:13:20.800]  of a lot of people is in Japan because Japan has the worst debt situation in
[02:13:20.800 --> 02:13:24.640]  the world and they're bringing in a new government in a couple of weeks who has
[02:13:24.640 --> 02:13:30.840]  publicly stated that he wants to bring in a quadrillion in yen printing and he
[02:13:30.840 --> 02:13:37.120]  wants to kill the Japanese yen which would possibly be the first of the G7
[02:13:37.120 --> 02:13:43.120]  nations to enter into a hyperinflationary currency collapse so I'm you know
[02:13:43.120 --> 02:13:46.920]  that's kind of where I'm putting my chips right now I think the the global
[02:13:46.920 --> 02:13:52.720]  currency collapse could start in Japan and I'm sticking to my my timeline of
[02:13:52.720 --> 02:13:56.120]  the next five months I want to point your attention director attention is
[02:13:56.120 --> 02:13:59.360]  something that just came out a couple of weeks a couple of days ago in
[02:13:59.360 --> 02:14:03.320]  Switzerland now they've introduced negative interest rates this is
[02:14:03.320 --> 02:14:07.440]  something I predicted on your show and a couple of others I predicted for you
[02:14:07.440 --> 02:14:12.720]  know a year ago or so and so if you keep the money in a Swiss bank they charge
[02:14:12.720 --> 02:14:18.200]  you to keep your money in a Swiss bank it's a negative interest rate this this
[02:14:18.200 --> 02:14:22.280]  is a form of a capital control they don't want people putting their money into
[02:14:22.280 --> 02:14:26.880]  Switzerland so if you're trying to escape let's say you're a Japanese yen
[02:14:26.880 --> 02:14:29.840]  investor and you're trying to escape the yen and you want to put your money in
[02:14:29.840 --> 02:14:33.920]  Switzerland the Swiss the Swiss government will charge you to keep your
[02:14:33.920 --> 02:14:39.000]  money in a Swiss money market or a cash account and right now there are six
[02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:43.040]  countries in Europe that charge negative interest rates with Switzerland charging
[02:14:43.040 --> 02:14:47.640]  a negative up to a half a percentage point to a point on two-year paper and
[02:14:47.640 --> 02:14:51.520]  there's five other countries that offer negative interest rates so this idea of
[02:14:51.520 --> 02:14:55.120]  putting your money someplace where it's going to be safe well these countries
[02:14:55.120 --> 02:14:59.280]  have figured this out and they're charging you to keep your money in the
[02:14:59.280 --> 02:15:03.320]  bank so not only do you have inflation to deal with but you have the fact that
[02:15:03.320 --> 02:15:08.920]  the banks are now openly confiscating your money using negative interest rates
[02:15:08.920 --> 02:15:13.440]  this of course will come to the United States soon enough and so it'll come to
[02:15:13.440 --> 02:15:19.960]  the UK as well so not here's another big story from just breaking which is part
[02:15:19.960 --> 02:15:23.600]  of what we talked about on your show before you know Corrections Corps of
[02:15:23.600 --> 02:15:29.320]  America the company that is the biggest private prison operator in America the
[02:15:29.320 --> 02:15:33.240]  company that just did a deal with 48 states in America saying that we'll
[02:15:33.240 --> 02:15:37.720]  take your prison business from you and we'll run your prisons if you guarantee
[02:15:37.720 --> 02:15:42.400]  98% occupancy that is to say you put people in prison well it just came out
[02:15:42.400 --> 02:15:47.880]  that Corrections Corps of America is using gangs to run their prisons so
[02:15:47.880 --> 02:15:52.280]  this is like a gang Ponzi scheme where the gangs run the prisons to go out to
[02:15:52.280 --> 02:15:56.440]  go and put more gangs in prison to run the prison and then they rotate them out
[02:15:56.440 --> 02:16:00.360]  back on the street to be protected by the police the certain groups to run the
[02:16:00.360 --> 02:16:03.720]  drugs to wander it back through the mega banks publicly who've been caught and
[02:16:03.720 --> 02:16:08.320]  don't get in trouble who then own the subsidiary private prison so it's an
[02:16:08.320 --> 02:16:13.080]  absolute full-spectrum dominance program and you can buy stock in Corrections
[02:16:13.080 --> 02:16:17.280]  Corps of America and you know the elites that Lindsey Williams talks about they
[02:16:17.280 --> 02:16:21.480]  mean they buy stock in Corrections Corps of America so they it's like buying stock
[02:16:21.480 --> 02:16:26.320]  on a plantation from antebellum South if you wanted to buy or buying stock in
[02:16:26.320 --> 02:16:29.520]  Auschwitz hey wouldn't that be a great idea you could buy stock in Auschwitz of
[02:16:29.520 --> 02:16:32.840]  course I'm I'm sure if Goldman Sachs had an opportunity they would take Auschwitz
[02:16:32.840 --> 02:16:35.920]  public with well actually a lot of the mega banks did fund Hitler as you know
[02:16:35.920 --> 02:16:39.280]  and then and then people like my grandfather they weren't allowed to
[02:16:39.280 --> 02:16:45.760]  bomb whole sectors that had forward in GM factories and slave camps so because
[02:16:45.760 --> 02:16:50.040]  the war was a huge profit on both sides and let's take a look at the global debt
[02:16:50.040 --> 02:16:56.320]  situation since we were on last the G7 countries they've moved from being having
[02:16:56.320 --> 02:17:04.000]  a debt to GDP of 375 percent debt to GDP ratios now at 415 percent debt to GDP
[02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:09.480]  ratio and here's here's the really the the the the story and and the the
[02:17:09.480 --> 02:17:15.440]  methodology and the psychosis Ben Bernanke talks about deflation and he
[02:17:15.440 --> 02:17:21.400]  therefore Jack's interest rates down to near zero percent in fact by putting
[02:17:21.400 --> 02:17:26.560]  interest rates near zero percent he causes deflation he causes now the
[02:17:26.560 --> 02:17:30.240]  insurance industry has stated that because interest rates are so low they
[02:17:30.240 --> 02:17:33.400]  can no longer operate as insurance companies see if you don't have insurance
[02:17:33.400 --> 02:17:36.160]  you don't have private property you don't have private property you don't have
[02:17:36.160 --> 02:17:39.840]  capitalism so the insurance industry is not saying we can't operate with this
[02:17:39.840 --> 02:17:43.200]  low interest rate environment so that's the form of deflation the wages are
[02:17:43.200 --> 02:17:46.800]  getting completely scrubbed there hasn't been any wage growth in years that's a
[02:17:46.800 --> 02:17:50.360]  form of deflation and so Bernanke says we're gonna lower interest rates to fight
[02:17:50.360 --> 02:17:53.880]  deflation but in fact by lowering interest rates he's guaranteeing in
[02:17:53.880 --> 02:18:00.000]  deflation at the same time he is creating and this is a remarkable statistic
[02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:07.960]  the bond market in America is at a 240 year high the bond market in the United
[02:18:07.960 --> 02:18:14.960]  Kingdom is at a 300 year high never have bonds in 300 years in this country United
[02:18:14.960 --> 02:18:19.320]  Kingdom have been hired and they are now or in 240 years in America than they are
[02:18:19.320 --> 02:18:23.960]  right now that is a classic bubble what people say well what about this idea
[02:18:23.960 --> 02:18:26.760]  that interest rates are going to go higher interest rates to go higher when
[02:18:26.760 --> 02:18:30.160]  this bond bubble collapses and this is part of what I'm saying in the next five
[02:18:30.160 --> 02:18:34.680]  months the trigger that will create the cascade the domino effect probably
[02:18:34.680 --> 02:18:38.080]  starting in Japan toward a global sovereign bond collapse which means
[02:18:38.080 --> 02:18:42.600]  interest rates which are the inverse of a bond price go up dramatically and
[02:18:42.600 --> 02:18:49.680]  that's your why is the Bank of England head saying this is Armageddon well they
[02:18:49.680 --> 02:18:53.320]  are he's now leaving a Mervyn King is on the way out they're bringing this
[02:18:53.320 --> 02:18:56.400]  Canadian and you know here's a perfect example what you talk about the New
[02:18:56.400 --> 02:18:59.720]  World Order the fact that you can just plug and play and take a Canadian
[02:18:59.720 --> 02:19:03.440]  central banker and stick it into a British institution the Bank of England
[02:19:03.440 --> 02:19:08.040]  without anyone questioning well why it who are they answering to they're not
[02:19:08.040 --> 02:19:10.520]  and they're not answering to the sovereign in which they work they're
[02:19:10.520 --> 02:19:14.560]  answering to a global banking establishment if you can just take the
[02:19:14.560 --> 02:19:17.440]  Canadian central banker and put him into London then what then they're going to
[02:19:17.440 --> 02:19:21.280]  take who's gonna who's gonna fill the London central the Canadian central bank
[02:19:21.280 --> 02:19:24.720]  that'll probably be somebody from the global banking established that's like
[02:19:24.720 --> 02:19:29.400]  that's like Ireland it's like Greece it's like Italy they just a point not just
[02:19:29.400 --> 02:19:33.040]  the bankers but the presidents and prime ministers now and then brag we're in a
[02:19:33.040 --> 02:19:35.880]  world government in hundreds of newspapers but then have the Southern
[02:19:35.880 --> 02:19:40.400]  Mervyn Law Center show you're a terrorist if you talk about it and they tell the
[02:19:40.400 --> 02:19:43.760]  police and training manuals none of it exists and the cops are like the general
[02:19:43.760 --> 02:19:46.880]  public don't even want to tie their shoelaces they believe it I mean it is
[02:19:46.880 --> 02:19:51.440]  and the government runs Al Qaeda publicly and I've got to give my rights up
[02:19:51.440 --> 02:19:55.280]  if I'm downtown shooting video cops come over and say you can't videotape you
[02:19:55.280 --> 02:19:59.080]  might be Al Qaeda while the government runs Al Qaeda and the cop doesn't even
[02:19:59.080 --> 02:20:03.840]  know what continent he's on we'll be back hi there my name is Frank Bates what

[02:23:09.400 --> 02:23:14.480]  I learned about RNA drops I learned that 97% of my DNA that scientists have
[02:23:14.480 --> 02:23:18.560]  called junk is actually packed with millions of gene switches that play a
[02:23:18.560 --> 02:23:22.960]  critical role in controlling how my cells organs and other tissues behave I
[02:23:22.960 --> 02:23:26.480]  learned I don't have to put up with disease decay or decline like I've been
[02:23:26.480 --> 02:23:31.800]  conditioned to believe I began taking RNA drops a 100% natural formula designed

[02:24:15.480 --> 02:24:21.760]  a KKK racist period Bob Costas picks up his column and agrees that you know
[02:24:21.760 --> 02:24:27.160]  handguns basically be banned and guns are causing crime and now Pierce Morgan we
[02:24:27.160 --> 02:24:30.720]  were just talking about foreigners being sent to run England foreigners being
[02:24:30.720 --> 02:24:34.920]  sent to run other countries that's the New World Order here's Morgan has called

[02:24:39.600 --> 02:24:48.200]  control so there you go I mean you know and again it's amazing that that this
[02:24:48.200 --> 02:24:53.400]  is what we live under that's up at info wars.com right now long segment coming

[02:25:00.600 --> 02:25:04.240]  that Max is gonna start doing 10-minute special reports for info wars nightly
[02:25:04.240 --> 02:25:08.520]  news once a week as well as joining us a few times a month we're very honored to
[02:25:08.520 --> 02:25:13.360]  have him do that and I should add that you should follow him at Twitter and also
[02:25:13.360 --> 02:25:20.200]  maxkaiser.com and we're gonna put it up on screen Max it's at Max Kaiser very
[02:25:20.200 --> 02:25:25.400]  very simple to follow you at Twitter and I'm real Alex Jones and I've got a at
[02:25:25.400 --> 02:25:29.120]  prison planet but I don't know why I don't have a at real Alex Jones we'll
[02:25:29.120 --> 02:25:32.480]  figure that out but at Max Kaiser everybody should follow him there for
[02:25:32.480 --> 02:25:36.800]  all the updates and I hope you're wrong but I do see massive preparations for
[02:25:36.800 --> 02:25:42.680]  this and look at this cops to Congress we need logs of Americans text messages
[02:25:42.680 --> 02:25:47.880]  CNET news guilty into proven innocent feds telling states to pass laws allowing
[02:25:47.880 --> 02:25:54.200]  highway checkpoints TSA announces highway checkpoints in all 50 states they're
[02:25:54.200 --> 02:25:57.840]  announcing capital controls that you won't be able to leave the country now if
[02:25:57.840 --> 02:26:03.280]  they say you owe money I mean this is becoming Nazi Germany Max Kaiser well
[02:26:03.280 --> 02:26:08.040]  it's not the capital controls it's not just even trying to leave money leave the
[02:26:08.040 --> 02:26:13.840]  country across borders is the central banks don't trust each other that's why
[02:26:13.840 --> 02:26:20.680]  the lending is not being made a lot of people are complaining that the banks
[02:26:20.680 --> 02:26:24.400]  are not lending enough to stimulate business because the banks are hoarding
[02:26:24.400 --> 02:26:29.280]  cash and they're hoarding cash because they don't trust each other because they
[02:26:29.280 --> 02:26:35.260]  know that credit freeze like in 2008 or a collapse as I'm predicting will come
[02:26:35.260 --> 02:26:40.720]  they need that money on hand to pay themselves basically and they don't
[02:26:40.720 --> 02:26:43.880]  they don't trust each other this is another reason why since 2009 the
[02:26:43.880 --> 02:26:48.200]  central banks have been buying gold this year they're gonna be buying over 500
[02:26:48.200 --> 02:26:52.040]  tons of gold that's just the central banks also starting next year Alex the
[02:26:52.040 --> 02:27:00.240]  basil agreement that will classify gold for banks as a tier one asset which
[02:27:00.240 --> 02:27:04.680]  means that you can borrow 100 cents on the dollar against gold that you own so
[02:27:04.680 --> 02:27:10.480]  another big buyer of gold in 2013 will be banks and China's doing it
[02:27:10.480 --> 02:27:15.800]  universities are doing it Soros is doing it while simultaneously bad-mouthing it
[02:27:15.800 --> 02:27:24.680]  I mean a lot of this for me signals a bull market in gold well China is due to
[02:27:24.680 --> 02:27:28.000]  surprise everybody when they announced their official reserve figures they
[02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:32.680]  officially had a thousand fifty one tons but now it's pretty much an open
[02:27:32.680 --> 02:27:35.720]  secret that they have at least three thousand tons they're the biggest gold
[02:27:35.720 --> 02:27:39.440]  producer in the world the biggest gold miner in the world none of the gold
[02:27:39.440 --> 02:27:43.680]  leaves China there was a report that came out a couple of weeks ago proving or
[02:27:43.680 --> 02:27:48.600]  suggesting or indicating that no gold bar circulating in the vaults of any of
[02:27:48.600 --> 02:27:52.320]  the banks around the world have any Chinese stamps on them because China
[02:27:52.320 --> 02:27:56.120]  does not let this gold leave China they're out all over the world accumulating
[02:27:56.120 --> 02:28:00.880]  gold they want to get enough gold in in-house to give them protection against
[02:28:00.880 --> 02:28:05.640]  that huge reserve of dollars that they have a three trillion paper money
[02:28:05.640 --> 02:28:09.840]  reserves over a trillion of their massively hedging with gold and who
[02:28:09.840 --> 02:28:13.760]  else is doing that basically everybody well Mexico has increased their gold
[02:28:13.760 --> 02:28:18.600]  position by thousands of percentage points Korea's been buying gold at every
[02:28:18.600 --> 02:28:23.960]  central bank in the world not like me and I make that I made no many of the
[02:28:23.960 --> 02:28:28.640]  central banks in the world are buying gold some are famously not buying gold
[02:28:28.640 --> 02:28:32.080]  like the Bank of England soul what about all the fake Thompson I heard you
[02:28:32.080 --> 02:28:36.160]  talking about that five years ago it's surfacing in vaults and government and
[02:28:36.160 --> 02:28:40.600]  private central banks everywhere well when the paper money collapses you know
[02:28:40.600 --> 02:28:46.160]  tungsten is not that bad thing to have you know I mean anything that's not paper
[02:28:46.160 --> 02:28:51.400]  is going to be valuable against paper money apocalypse that's coming but the
[02:28:51.400 --> 02:28:56.680]  the tungsten has been an issue for years and years I mean I it's one of the
[02:28:56.680 --> 02:29:02.040]  another concern I mean you need to keep your head up and make sure you know my
[02:29:02.040 --> 02:29:08.960]  point is the gold covered tungsten is surfacing everywhere the big gold market
[02:29:08.960 --> 02:29:13.920]  and it's not enough of an issue to alter the these big trends that we're
[02:29:13.920 --> 02:29:18.400]  seeing no no I understand I'm just saying that shows that these Western
[02:29:18.400 --> 02:29:23.440]  banks and don't have as much gold as they said they have well the bigger
[02:29:23.440 --> 02:29:28.000]  problem is that they've leased it out that this is why the lot of the gold in
[02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:31.440]  central banks balls that they've leased out now there's a big question mark
[02:29:31.440 --> 02:29:37.040]  whether that gold is actually there I think that it contrasts this with what
[02:29:37.040 --> 02:29:41.240]  we saw in the United States a couple of weeks ago when it was a thought that
[02:29:41.240 --> 02:29:44.640]  okay max we're going to break your mics distorting just a tad you may want to
[02:29:44.640 --> 02:29:47.760]  back off at a bit we're gonna have a special report on guns and the attack

[02:33:18.480 --> 02:33:26.600]  disinformation Bob Costas has responded to my call that he be fired if he does
[02:33:26.600 --> 02:33:33.160]  not apologize and obviously others have been calling for that as well he put out
[02:33:33.160 --> 02:33:36.520]  one clarification last night that basically said we were too stupid to
[02:33:36.520 --> 02:33:39.560]  understand what he was saying so another slap in the face of a video about
[02:33:39.560 --> 02:33:43.840]  that up on info wars dot com we're about to premiere a detailed analysis of this
[02:33:43.840 --> 02:33:50.040]  and then go back to Max Kaiser Max Kaiser dot com he then went on in a new
[02:33:50.040 --> 02:33:57.240]  USA today that has a transcript of here on the Dan Patrick show today this
[02:33:57.240 --> 02:34:02.680]  morning saying that sometimes the quality of those who oppose you speaks for
[02:34:02.680 --> 02:34:07.880]  itself and then he wanted to talk about racist so so now everything's racist if
[02:34:07.880 --> 02:34:11.800]  you don't and you just say racist like oh you want to own guns you're racist so
[02:34:11.800 --> 02:34:15.720]  just said well there's some racism and then he goes on to say a discussion
[02:34:15.720 --> 02:34:20.080]  should ensue about the football culture which is totally degenerate nowadays and
[02:34:20.080 --> 02:34:23.640]  he added the gun culture so they're trying to blame guns for you know for
[02:34:23.640 --> 02:34:27.920]  the gangster culture domestic violence so now guns are domestic violence those
[02:34:27.920 --> 02:34:31.320]  issues should be discussed if we're looking for some kind of elusive
[02:34:31.320 --> 02:34:36.320]  perspective some some more arrogant statements here so not a real apology but
[02:34:36.320 --> 02:34:41.360]  he's gone from saying oh let me correct misinterpretations to oh let me correct
[02:34:41.360 --> 02:34:46.320]  mistakes too but still you shouldn't be able to own guns so you need to be fired
[02:34:46.320 --> 02:34:49.480]  cost us okay and everybody knows who you are I'm just gonna be a boycott of the
[02:34:49.480 --> 02:34:54.280]  NFL because they authorized what you did same thing NBC and Fox is it's all
[02:34:54.280 --> 02:34:57.640]  started with their columnist on Fox Sports saying the Second Amendment needs
[02:34:57.640 --> 02:35:01.280]  to be banned and anybody that owns guns or racist and whites are basically
[02:35:01.280 --> 02:35:04.760]  inherently bad people and I guess that's that's what you see out of Rupert Murdoch
[02:35:04.760 --> 02:35:08.840]  right there just unbelievable how disgusting this is we're gonna air a
[02:35:08.840 --> 02:35:12.200]  report I did with Aaron Dykes on this premiering here and we're gonna go right
[02:35:12.200 --> 02:35:17.240]  back to Max Kaiser with where he how he sees the collapse unfolding because
[02:35:17.240 --> 02:35:21.320]  unfortunately it looks like he may be right and it's an engineered collapse
[02:35:21.320 --> 02:35:25.240]  in ways we can protect ourselves with Max Kaiser but first here's this report
[02:35:25.240 --> 02:35:29.280]  people have credibility with young people should be on the television telling
[02:35:29.280 --> 02:35:33.080]  these youngsters that it's long the carrying on ultimate tragedy bloodied
[02:35:33.080 --> 02:35:37.400]  and dead Javon Belcher's action handguns do not enhance our safety and just
[02:35:37.400 --> 02:35:42.080]  really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way the
[02:35:42.080 --> 02:35:47.120]  assault weapons ban made sense well the establishments war against the right to
[02:35:47.120 --> 02:35:51.200]  keep their arms and the rest of our Bill of Rights is now reaching a high tide
[02:35:51.200 --> 02:35:57.840]  mark you can make no mistake Bob Costas during Sunday Night Football on NBC was
[02:35:57.840 --> 02:36:02.080]  declaring war on the Second Amendment you want some actual perspective on this
[02:36:02.080 --> 02:36:07.000]  well a bit of it comes from the Kansas City base writer Jason Whitlock our
[02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:11.440]  current gun culture Whitlock wrote ensures that more and more domestic
[02:36:11.440 --> 02:36:15.720]  disputes will end in the ultimate tragedy and that more convenience store
[02:36:15.720 --> 02:36:20.320]  confrontations over loud music coming from a car will leave more teenage boys
[02:36:20.320 --> 02:36:24.840]  bloodied and dead and make no mistake he was reading off a teleprompter at that
[02:36:24.840 --> 02:36:31.000]  time and his remarks had all been free approved handguns do not enhance our
[02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:36.280]  safety they exacerbate our flaws tempt us to escalate arguments and bait us
[02:36:36.280 --> 02:36:41.680]  into embracing confrontation rather than avoiding it turning the NFL into even
[02:36:41.680 --> 02:36:46.800]  more of a propaganda tool of the authoritarians that control Washington
[02:36:46.800 --> 02:36:52.560]  DC if Javon Belcher didn't possess a gun he and Cassandra Perkins would both be
[02:36:52.560 --> 02:36:59.320]  alive today leave it to NBC and Bob Costas to take a tragic event and try to
[02:36:59.320 --> 02:37:04.160]  capitalize on it to destroy the Second Amendment of our Bill of Rights and
[02:37:04.160 --> 02:37:12.080]  Constitution coming out and blaming a tragic shooting on the Second Amendment
[02:37:12.080 --> 02:37:19.440]  is asinine it's like blaming obesity on spoons and forks but that's exactly what
[02:37:19.440 --> 02:37:24.400]  he did Costas really thinks we're stupid when he says you know there's a gun
[02:37:24.400 --> 02:37:30.880]  culture in the NFL you mean the thug culture that's in the NFL pit bullfights
[02:37:30.880 --> 02:37:35.280]  and all the rest of it you mean that culture they're trying to claim that
[02:37:35.280 --> 02:37:42.440]  the American gun culture is the thug culture that's in the NFL don't blame
[02:37:42.440 --> 02:37:47.560]  us for your culture of drugged out of their mind athletes on pain pills and
[02:37:47.560 --> 02:37:52.760]  psychotropic drugs like Prozac known to cause psychotic breaks and men who have
[02:37:52.760 --> 02:37:57.000]  had concussions after concussions after concussions going home and killing
[02:37:57.000 --> 02:38:02.720]  their families and you notice Bob Costas says I know in the days to come the NFL
[02:38:02.720 --> 02:38:07.160]  may get blamed but you can't deny it's guns if there wouldn't have been guns
[02:38:07.160 --> 02:38:10.960]  this wouldn't have happened he's saying let's blame the Second Amendment let's
[02:38:10.960 --> 02:38:15.920]  blame one of the few rights left in this country let's not blame the NFL and the
[02:38:15.920 --> 02:38:21.040]  decadent gladiatorial spectacle it's become the bureaucracy that's hijacked
[02:38:21.040 --> 02:38:26.920]  this country admits they're coming after our firearms they have told us that
[02:38:26.920 --> 02:38:34.400]  they are doing this part of it is seeing if we can get an assault weapons ban
[02:38:34.400 --> 02:38:39.760]  reintroduced an assault weapons ban reintroduced Obama four years ago told
[02:38:39.760 --> 02:38:43.840]  supporters that he doesn't like bitter clingers people that cling to their
[02:38:43.840 --> 02:38:54.560]  second amendment think of how stupid the gun grabbers think you are they point
[02:38:54.560 --> 02:38:58.240]  out the violence that's going on in the youth of this country in places like
[02:38:58.240 --> 02:39:01.800]  Chicago and New York that have the highest crime rates in the United States
[02:39:01.800 --> 02:39:06.800]  where they've completely banned guns for the general public and then they point
[02:39:06.800 --> 02:39:10.560]  at Chicago and New York and say that's the reason that we need to turn our guns
[02:39:10.560 --> 02:39:14.560]  in in places like Texas frankly in my hometown of Chicago there's an awful
[02:39:14.560 --> 02:39:17.960]  lot of violence and they're not using AK-47s they're using cheap handguns it's
[02:39:17.960 --> 02:39:22.520]  incredible they take the guns the crime rates explode in those areas while the
[02:39:22.520 --> 02:39:27.600]  crime rates drop in areas all over the United States where you have a high
[02:39:27.600 --> 02:39:34.120]  rate of legal lawful gun ownership I expected the victim disarmament anti
[02:39:34.120 --> 02:39:40.680]  defense crowd to come out and use this tragedy but to see the NFL NBC via their
[02:39:40.680 --> 02:39:44.600]  frontman Bob Costas do it lets you know that they are blowing the bugle that
[02:39:44.600 --> 02:39:49.680]  they are charging in on our second amendment and all the facts prove that
[02:39:49.680 --> 02:39:54.960]  that is what is now happening none of us very under any illusion that reinstating
[02:39:54.960 --> 02:40:02.040]  that ban would be easy and so what we focused on is existing loss if the
[02:40:02.040 --> 02:40:06.600]  president would stage fast and furious shipping guns into Mexico to demonize
[02:40:06.600 --> 02:40:10.520]  the second amendment and call for a gun ban they will use any crisis out there
[02:40:10.520 --> 02:40:15.520]  to restrict our guns trafficking illegal firearms sending them across the
[02:40:15.520 --> 02:40:21.720]  border is illegal that's something that we can stop and so our focus is to work
[02:40:21.720 --> 02:40:27.560]  with Secretary Napolitano keep in mind he did it
[02:40:27.560 --> 02:40:32.240]  turn the guns and now the reports are beginning to come out that Obama may use
[02:40:32.240 --> 02:40:35.840]  executive orders to restrict the second amendment because he can't get Congress to
[02:40:35.840 --> 02:40:38.680]  do it he's already done that on cybersecurity he's already done that
[02:40:38.680 --> 02:40:41.840]  shutting down power plants he's already said NATO in the UN command our
[02:40:41.840 --> 02:40:46.440]  military he is becoming a dictator more and more they have asked the media to
[02:40:46.440 --> 02:40:50.520]  go out and blame everything on our right to keep their arms people who have
[02:40:50.520 --> 02:40:54.200]  credibility with young people should be on the television telling these youngsters
[02:40:54.200 --> 02:40:59.120]  that it's wrong to carry a gun so what you're seeing is part of the brainwashing
[02:40:59.120 --> 02:41:04.400]  that Attorney General Holder called for more than 15 years ago and is calling
[02:41:04.400 --> 02:41:08.520]  for again and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a
[02:41:08.520 --> 02:41:12.560]  vastly different way and the fact that Costas would be authorized to do
[02:41:12.560 --> 02:41:18.240]  something like this during Sunday football with the NFL let you know they
[02:41:18.240 --> 02:41:22.840]  mean business a corporate company man like Costas you know he got it approved
[02:41:22.840 --> 02:41:30.440]  so this is the NFL and NBC endorsing an attack on one of the few basic liberties
[02:41:30.440 --> 02:41:37.800]  that America has left unbelievably outrageous and signals a coordinated
[02:41:37.800 --> 02:41:43.240]  attack on the Second Amendment and if we won't speak out against this now if we
[02:41:43.240 --> 02:41:48.880]  won't demand that Bob Costas at least apologize for using this tragedy we're
[02:41:48.880 --> 02:41:54.420]  going to lose our Second Amendment now Hank Williams Jr. said this country was
[02:41:54.420 --> 02:41:58.360]  turning into a dictatorship and he was fired you mean when John Boehner played
[02:41:58.360 --> 02:42:04.720]  golf with President Obama oh yeah it'd be like Hitler playing golf with Netanyahu
[02:42:04.720 --> 02:42:11.040]  okay okay not hardly all we're asking for is that Bob Costas apologized and
[02:42:11.040 --> 02:42:18.360]  that the NFL repudiate what was said as well as NBC but if that is not done I
[02:42:18.360 --> 02:42:23.200]  promise you this and over 150 million other gun owners in this country do as
[02:42:23.200 --> 02:42:30.960]  well we are not going to rest until the NFL loses a large portion of their
[02:42:30.960 --> 02:42:37.240]  audience and NBC sponsors or boycott it it's time to turn off the NFL it's time
[02:42:37.240 --> 02:42:42.680]  to turn off NBC and it's time to stop watching that little globalist frontman
[02:42:42.680 --> 02:42:48.000]  Bob Costas it's time to take it personal when they try to take our guns
[02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:54.480]  that's why I'm calling for everyone to mail spoons with a note explaining to
[02:42:54.480 --> 02:43:01.440]  NBC that blaming guns for crime is like blaming spoons for fat people and it's
[02:43:01.440 --> 02:43:05.880]  time to mail Bob Costas spoons we're going to put the address under this
[02:43:05.880 --> 02:43:12.000]  video in the links below and it's time to call the sponsors of NBC and the NFL
[02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:15.880]  and to let them know you're not going to support them either it's time for the
[02:43:15.880 --> 02:43:20.440]  American people to stand up it's time for the sleeping giant that is the
[02:43:20.440 --> 02:43:24.840]  United States of America to rediscover the Bill of Rights and Constitution
[02:43:24.840 --> 02:43:29.560]  these are our rights and you are not going to steal them do you understand
[02:43:29.560 --> 02:43:35.640]  this the second amendment is the line in the sand I'm Alex Jones signing off for
[02:43:35.640 --> 02:43:42.480]  info wars.com all right that video will be live the next 10 minutes at info
[02:43:42.480 --> 02:43:46.360]  wars.com and prisonpunna.com and I will tweet it out at the real Alex Jones
[02:43:46.360 --> 02:43:51.000]  please retweet it and again also follow Max Kaiser at maxkaiser.com again I
[02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:54.000]  apologize to Max for airing that but Aaron stayed up all night to get it done
[02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:57.120]  and then we wanted it for the first hour but we were behind and so we aired it
[02:43:57.120 --> 02:44:00.200]  now we're always honored to have Max Kaiser but it's good to have that in
[02:44:00.200 --> 02:44:03.520]  the middle of the report as well you've got the floor till we go to break Max
[02:44:03.520 --> 02:44:07.600]  any comments on the gun thing but getting back into your bold prediction
[02:44:07.600 --> 02:44:11.320]  that the collapse is really going to accelerate in April you've already
[02:44:11.320 --> 02:44:14.360]  broken down why that's happening we've got the head of the Bank of England
[02:44:14.360 --> 02:44:18.200]  saying what you're saying now and you're in England right now that's pretty
[02:44:18.200 --> 02:44:24.960]  creepy so tell us what it'll look like and where it goes from there hey well
[02:44:24.960 --> 02:44:29.960]  first of all OJ Simpson didn't have a gun didn't stop him from killing his
[02:44:29.960 --> 02:44:34.080]  wife wow that's incredible I actually made that point in the video but Aaron
[02:44:34.080 --> 02:44:38.360]  cut it out for some reason yeah Nicole Simpson she did a nice with a
[02:44:38.360 --> 02:44:42.800]  with a concealed carry when OJ or whoever it was brought that knife to a
[02:44:42.800 --> 02:44:48.640]  gunfight yeah well wasn't Bob Costas involved in a pedophile scandal with
[02:44:48.640 --> 02:44:52.920]  Sandusky for a while he had him on his show and they were trying to cover that
[02:44:52.920 --> 02:44:56.200]  up for a while until Sandusky got on the show and basically admitted he was a
[02:44:56.200 --> 02:45:00.240]  pedophile and then Bob had what you see that image of him all shaken up like oh
[02:45:00.240 --> 02:45:04.640]  my god I invited a pedophile on my show and then he tried to you know talk his
[02:45:04.640 --> 02:45:09.160]  way out of it so this guy's a loser but anyway talking about the collapse of the
[02:45:09.160 --> 02:45:15.760]  you know central bank system and fiat currencies around the world this is as I
[02:45:15.760 --> 02:45:21.400]  say baked into the cake now I believe we're gonna see it by April of 2013 if
[02:45:21.400 --> 02:45:26.640]  I'm wrong I will I will happily admit that I was wrong on my timing you know
[02:45:26.640 --> 02:45:29.760]  the trends are still there and the still in place somebody else will get the
[02:45:29.760 --> 02:45:34.600]  timing perhaps better than I than I have I'm gonna stick to my timing but you
[02:45:34.600 --> 02:45:37.640]  know in the United States is it's remarkable that two weeks ago three
[02:45:37.640 --> 02:45:41.880]  weeks ago to give you an idea of the disconnect people have with with what's
[02:45:41.880 --> 02:45:46.320]  happening in the central banks on Wall Street remember when there was a threat
[02:45:46.320 --> 02:45:50.920]  that we're gonna close down the producer of Twinkies and then within an hour
[02:45:50.920 --> 02:45:57.200]  Twinkies were selling for $8,000 a Twinkie on eBay now that gives you an idea of
[02:45:57.200 --> 02:46:01.280]  the disconnect in the United States that the average person has with with what
[02:46:01.280 --> 02:46:06.440]  the values are that run the system versus what the intrinsic value of a
[02:46:06.440 --> 02:46:12.280]  Twinkie actually is so you know you have this remarkable explosion of Twinkie
[02:46:12.280 --> 02:46:16.240]  buying on eBay because people were scared that suddenly Twinkies were not
[02:46:16.240 --> 02:46:21.360]  being available anymore and then that mania passed six six hours or ten hours
[02:46:21.360 --> 02:46:25.720]  later and was on to some other mania you know people of course would probably
[02:46:25.720 --> 02:46:29.560]  get totally caught up in an NFL game over the weekend where they can watch
[02:46:29.560 --> 02:46:34.120]  steroid driven drug addicts pound each other over the head for a million
[02:46:34.120 --> 02:46:40.400]  dollars it's true you know so they're just going from dice from distraction to
[02:46:40.400 --> 02:46:45.720]  distraction meanwhile the main thing here that I need I'm gonna emphasize it
[02:46:45.720 --> 02:46:53.080]  the central banks themselves that for 30 40 years were colluding in pushing a
[02:46:53.080 --> 02:46:58.760]  financialization a transactionalization that a world that where work and labor
[02:46:58.760 --> 02:47:05.920]  was replaced with technocracy and money they no longer trust each other that is
[02:47:05.920 --> 02:47:11.000]  a fundamental difference today started in 2009 after the big collapse of 2008
[02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:16.280]  and that and we know that they don't trust each other because they themselves
[02:47:16.280 --> 02:47:20.600]  are the biggest buyers of gold now here's the big moment that's going to
[02:47:20.600 --> 02:47:27.560]  change everything is when central banks who are now issuing money or creating
[02:47:27.560 --> 02:47:32.520]  money through quantitative easing to buy government bonds one of those central
[02:47:32.520 --> 02:47:36.360]  banks is going to break ranks and they're going to start printing money to buy
[02:47:36.360 --> 02:47:43.000]  gold and that will be the moment when gold starts to go on a magnificent tear
[02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:48.000]  on the upside and the global sovereign bond market starts to collapse because
[02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:51.360]  one of these banks is going to say enough is enough that the obvious
[02:47:51.360 --> 02:47:57.160]  contenders are China and Russia those are the obvious contenders the obvious
[02:47:57.160 --> 02:48:02.120]  contenders for a currency collapse hyperinflation we see in Japan and in the
[02:48:02.120 --> 02:48:09.120]  UK the UK is one of the has 900% debt to GDP it's one of the worst in the world so
[02:48:09.120 --> 02:48:12.440]  that's why we're here because we're covering the collapse in London and
[02:48:12.440 --> 02:48:16.080]  since we've been here as you pointed out the rhetoric coming out of the Bank of
[02:48:16.080 --> 02:48:20.400]  England is that this the bank of is that quantitative easing doesn't work anymore
[02:48:20.400 --> 02:48:26.120]  the debts are unsustainable and the economy is collapsing and there's very
[02:48:26.120 --> 02:48:30.680]  little that anyone can do so that's pretty much the the scenario up to this
[02:48:30.680 --> 02:48:36.800]  point how is raising all these massive taxes in Europe the United States going
[02:48:36.800 --> 02:48:39.840]  to fix things they're not idiots they know when they raise taxes on the poor
[02:48:39.840 --> 02:48:44.480]  middle class it's going to make these countries like Greece Ireland Spain the
[02:48:44.480 --> 02:48:48.300]  United States go into cardiac arrest but that's what they're doing the
[02:48:48.300 --> 02:48:54.200]  Republicans and Democrats are debating how much taxes to raise instead of
[02:48:54.200 --> 02:48:59.880]  talking about you know trying to rebuild the country what's your take on that
[02:48:59.880 --> 02:49:05.880]  well raising taxes will not increase the tax take at the end of the year because
[02:49:05.880 --> 02:49:10.120]  it'll put more people and companies out of business than it than any
[02:49:10.120 --> 02:49:14.480]  incremental gain on a marginal tax increase so net net the tax take is
[02:49:14.480 --> 02:49:18.840]  going to be it's going to be worse the reason I point to April of 2013 is my
[02:49:18.840 --> 02:49:24.360]  target date for the collapse is because I think the tax revenues reported for
[02:49:24.360 --> 02:49:28.440]  2013 in the United States will be shockingly under estimates and this
[02:49:28.440 --> 02:49:33.680]  will force the major rating agencies Moody's S&P and Fitch to downgrade the
[02:49:33.680 --> 02:49:38.040]  US government bond they've already downgraded to work we thought we think
[02:49:38.040 --> 02:49:41.360]  we're going to downgrade that again but the establishment knows that so they
[02:49:41.360 --> 02:49:45.680]  want to destroy the country but the establishment is buying gold that's what
[02:49:45.680 --> 02:49:49.280]  I'm saying they're buying gold and silver and because they don't trust each
[02:49:49.280 --> 02:49:54.000]  other and they know that in extremists even Alan Greenspan famously said that
[02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:59.560]  we learned from the collapse of Germany in the 40s that in extremists only gold
[02:49:59.560 --> 02:50:06.160]  is is counted as money and Alan Greenspan of course is the maestro of
[02:50:06.160 --> 02:50:11.360]  the of of the central bank that is the creator of the bubbles that that of course
[02:50:11.360 --> 02:50:16.400]  are the monster that ate the global economy so for him to even point this
[02:50:16.400 --> 02:50:22.840]  out is quite significant and this is unknown amongst those who understand the
[02:50:22.840 --> 02:50:27.600]  history of banking and money that when you have this type of crisis gold is
[02:50:27.600 --> 02:50:33.080]  really the only extinguisher of that is one way to continue to kind of put
[02:50:33.080 --> 02:50:36.960]  things off but there's still that slow slide I mean the economy worldwide is
[02:50:36.960 --> 02:50:41.760]  getting worse and worse I want to come back and ask you max well slide it's
[02:50:41.760 --> 02:50:47.120]  deceptive because you know if you look at a chart like Enron remember Enron this
[02:50:47.120 --> 02:50:51.640]  stock went from $2 to $90 until it stay there explain it to us on the other side
[02:50:51.640 --> 02:50:55.440]  and then I want to ask you will these globalists get away with it or is there
[02:50:55.440 --> 02:50:59.400]  any way to arrest them and then how would you fix the economy we'll be right
[02:50:59.400 --> 02:51:04.080]  back with Max Kaiser we all know that Berkey water purification systems are

[02:53:19.360 --> 02:53:22.680]  Gingrich wrote an op-ed piece for the Washington Post warning about this

[02:53:27.240 --> 02:53:30.200]  be because the liberals in the government are trying to cover it up

[02:54:46.400 --> 02:54:50.200]  going back to Max Kaiser okay Max go ahead you've got the floor with the
[02:54:50.200 --> 02:54:54.480]  point you were making about any way to arrest these bankers any way to bring
[02:54:54.480 --> 02:54:58.080]  them to justice we were making another point as well yeah no they you know the
[02:54:58.080 --> 02:55:02.560]  the guests on your show you've had and we've talked about this collapse coming
[02:55:02.560 --> 02:55:08.680]  and and you know the question is when and I think that it's you know if you're
[02:55:08.680 --> 02:55:13.280]  standing on on the surface of the earth you know it's tough to see that you're
[02:55:13.280 --> 02:55:17.520]  actually standing on a round object because it's a very large object and
[02:55:17.520 --> 02:55:22.640]  this crisis is very large but when it happens it'll happen quite quickly
[02:55:22.640 --> 02:55:26.640]  because this is an historic bubble we're talking about for bonds for you know you
[02:55:26.640 --> 02:55:31.540]  have to go back and compare to let's say the tulip bulb mania in Holland in
[02:55:31.540 --> 02:55:38.480]  1634 the price of tulip bulbs went from one and a half to 60 to zero in in
[02:55:38.480 --> 02:55:44.120]  France during the Mississippi bubble the the stock in that Ponzi scheme went
[02:55:44.120 --> 02:55:51.280]  from 500 to 18,000 to zero the South Sea bubble of 1720 the stock went from a
[02:55:51.280 --> 02:55:56.560]  hundred to a thousand to a hundred that more recently with Enron the stock went
[02:55:56.560 --> 02:56:02.240]  from $2 to 90 to zero what I'm saying is that the government bonds in America the
[02:56:02.240 --> 02:56:09.640]  US Treasury bond has never been hired in 240 years at the Treasury bond in the
[02:56:09.640 --> 02:56:16.180]  UK has never been higher in 300 years and when the bubble pops where it'll
[02:56:16.180 --> 02:56:22.600]  collapse by 50 60 70% in a lot with lightning speed as we've seen with these
[02:56:22.600 --> 02:56:27.640]  other historic bubbles so it'll be too late to do anything at that time you
[02:56:27.640 --> 02:56:33.160]  have to be prepared beforehand and if you want proof of what I'm saying is true
[02:56:33.160 --> 02:56:38.320]  look at what these central banks are doing for it since 1971 they were net
[02:56:38.320 --> 02:56:42.920]  sellers of gold and they bought paper but from 2009 after the collapse of
[02:56:42.920 --> 02:56:48.680]  2008 of Lehman Brothers they became net buyers of gold gold they're buying over
[02:56:48.680 --> 02:56:52.520]  500 tons this year and because they don't trust each other because they know
[02:56:52.520 --> 02:56:58.560]  this bubble is about to pop I I always go with the money I go with the smart
[02:56:58.560 --> 02:57:02.760]  money China has the money and they're smart enough to be buying gold the
[02:57:02.760 --> 02:57:05.960]  central bankers have the money and pretty soon they're going to be issuing
[02:57:05.960 --> 02:57:10.640]  money to buy gold instead of the bonds that are in this huge bubble and so those
[02:57:10.640 --> 02:57:15.200]  are the factors that we see in front of our face and we know that when this
[02:57:15.200 --> 02:57:21.240]  bubble pops this historic bubble like Nasdaq from 1981 to 2000 and went from
[02:57:21.240 --> 02:57:26.920]  100 to 5,000 then crashed to 1,500 in Nikkei remember the Nikkei bubble from
[02:57:26.920 --> 02:57:33.000]  1970 to 1992 it went from 3,000 to 40,000 then crashed to 8,000 at one point
[02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:38.580]  you had in the in the Japan that the land under the Royal Palace was worth
[02:57:38.580 --> 02:57:42.440]  more than the entire state of California and once and what's that happened more
[02:57:42.440 --> 02:57:47.120]  than 15 years ago they've never come back in Japan so you're saying there's
[02:57:47.120 --> 02:57:51.480]  going to be a treasury bubble go under we're in a bubble treasury bubble it's
[02:57:51.480 --> 02:57:57.080]  never oh my god do you attend your US Treasury bond has not been this high
[02:57:57.080 --> 02:58:00.520]  that is a say no no you're saying it's coming to an end it's obviously the
[02:58:00.520 --> 02:58:04.760]  biggest bubble in 300 years you're saying it begins to pop or will pop coming
[02:58:04.760 --> 02:58:13.040]  up on April 15th or thereafter how bad will it be it'll be it'll be the worst
[02:58:13.040 --> 02:58:20.000]  financial crisis in 100 years 150 years absolutely without a shadow I've talked
[02:58:20.000 --> 02:58:23.760]  to a lot of big insiders including well-known billionaires and they've
[02:58:23.760 --> 02:58:30.080]  said the word is all these companies are pulling back and digging in and so
[02:58:30.080 --> 02:58:33.080]  there's a lot of signs this is coming we're gonna go to break a little bit

[03:00:38.360 --> 03:00:42.760]  coming up Thursday night on M4's nightly news some other parts of it on the
[03:00:42.760 --> 03:00:49.080]  radio Friday Max Kaiser is our guest and Max you've got the floor still other
[03:00:49.080 --> 03:00:52.800]  points you'd like to make we're all ears I know I want to hear what you have to
[03:00:52.800 --> 03:00:58.680]  say and we'll be there gearing up for a police state yeah we know they're gonna
[03:00:58.680 --> 03:01:03.600]  try to just have all these new taxes and regulations six years in jail hundred
[03:01:03.600 --> 03:01:07.920]  thousand dollar fines for washing your car with subsides going in the drain dog
[03:01:07.920 --> 03:01:11.920]  poop six years in jail giant prisons opening everywhere I don't think we'll
[03:01:11.920 --> 03:01:16.720]  understand there the new labor in America will be slave labor it already is
[03:01:16.720 --> 03:01:22.720]  yeah absolutely because the economy is is contracting it's collapsing and there's
[03:01:22.720 --> 03:01:29.240]  no growth and you can't create growth by forcing interest rates down to zero the
[03:01:29.240 --> 03:01:33.080]  matter of fact that that creates deflation and it creates the catastrophe
[03:01:33.080 --> 03:01:36.480]  and they they're not going to stop now I don't know if you saw this but on Monday
[03:01:36.480 --> 03:01:41.120]  October 22nd of 2012 was a bombshell announcement from Germany the statement
[03:01:41.120 --> 03:01:44.760]  from Germany included a previously classified report that reveals that the
[03:01:44.760 --> 03:01:50.240]  Bundesbank withdrew nearly 1000 tons of gold from the Bank of England in 2000
[03:01:50.240 --> 03:01:56.200]  2001 decreasing Germany's gold holding in London from 1400 tons to 500 tons now
[03:01:56.200 --> 03:02:02.000]  the reason this is a significant is that at the time Gordon Brown sold 400 tons
[03:02:02.000 --> 03:02:08.920]  of Britain's gold and now we know he did so because Britain was caught without the
[03:02:08.920 --> 03:02:12.920]  gold Germany's gold in other words Germany went to repatriate their gold in
[03:02:12.920 --> 03:02:18.560]  2001 and live or has come out proving it's all rigged I mean this is it's all
[03:02:18.560 --> 03:02:22.680]  starting to collapse I think you might be right about April well they they I'm
[03:02:22.680 --> 03:02:26.920]  saying is that Britain had sold Germany's gold they sold Germany's gold and
[03:02:26.920 --> 03:02:30.600]  then when Germany came to collect their gold they didn't have it so Gordon Brown
[03:02:30.600 --> 03:02:35.840]  had to force the the gold market crash the gold market by telegraphing a sale of
[03:02:35.840 --> 03:02:41.240]  400 tons which crashed the gold market down to $250 an ounce which is
[03:02:41.240 --> 03:02:45.920]  considered to be Brown's bottom the worst price in 20 years to make good on
[03:02:45.920 --> 03:02:51.080]  that claim and this is important because Argent you know you've got Austria now
[03:02:51.080 --> 03:02:55.400]  and Germany Venezuela and all countries around the world that are
[03:02:55.400 --> 03:03:00.280]  repatriating gold not because we're going to a gold standard but because they
[03:03:00.280 --> 03:03:03.480]  are protecting themselves against currency collapse that's it that's a
[03:03:03.480 --> 03:03:06.880]  distinction that people don't understand we're not going to a gold standard
[03:03:06.880 --> 03:03:10.200]  where people have hordes of gold located in banks around the world and then
[03:03:10.200 --> 03:03:14.780]  because of trade imbalances you will move gold from one stock to another no
[03:03:14.780 --> 03:03:17.280]  that's not what we're talking about we're talking about these countries are
[03:03:17.280 --> 03:03:21.280]  now repatriating gold or amassing huge gold positions as a way to protect
[03:03:21.280 --> 03:03:25.920]  themselves against this fiat currency collapse which is now want a 100%
[03:03:25.920 --> 03:03:31.680]  debt certainty due to 0% interest rates thanks to Ben Bernanke and other
[03:03:31.680 --> 03:03:35.400]  central bankers around the world that have thrown the global economy under the
[03:03:35.400 --> 03:03:42.320]  bus there's hundreds of trillions of dollars worth of debt you know some
[03:03:42.320 --> 03:03:45.760]  call that you know derivatives which is the same in other words for debt which
[03:03:45.760 --> 03:03:51.040]  cannot possibly be paid back in a 10,000 years and there is no growth to pay
[03:03:51.040 --> 03:03:56.120]  for it anyway so all that is going the way of the dodo and the only thing that
[03:03:56.120 --> 03:04:02.200]  can give anyone any semblance of wealth preservation is going to be gold I agree
[03:04:02.200 --> 03:04:05.360]  we're almost out of time let me just say this the one heartening thing I see is a
[03:04:05.360 --> 03:04:09.560]  lot of these top bankers are buying houses and armored retreats and third
[03:04:09.560 --> 03:04:13.040]  world countries and distant islands and a lot of them are just pulling out and
[03:04:13.040 --> 03:04:16.720]  and leaving I think they know they're all gonna get arrested so we might
[03:04:16.720 --> 03:04:20.840]  actually be able to expose them and then use the crisis they've created to
[03:04:20.840 --> 03:04:32.040]  finally kick out the globalist great what's funny about that well they get
[03:04:32.040 --> 03:04:36.680]  on a jet and they're on an island in and you know in two hours and we're never
[03:04:36.680 --> 03:04:41.000]  here from them again but they're gonna leave behind a complete and utter chaos
[03:04:41.000 --> 03:04:52.560]  and there's no currently no system to talk about this you want to keep going
[03:04:52.560 --> 03:04:57.760]  max want to keep going in this subject I've been in for a warrior over driving
[03:04:57.760 --> 03:05:05.600]  over driving over driving over driving sodium fluoride in the body reduces IQ

[03:09:09.760 --> 03:09:13.720]  because you're so stupid you don't understand him his apology is an insult
[03:09:13.720 --> 03:09:20.280]  to everyone so Costas so that's it you need to be fired you guys fired Hank
[03:09:20.280 --> 03:09:24.600]  Williams Jr. for saying Obama was becoming a dictator he clarified to say
[03:09:24.600 --> 03:09:28.840]  both parties were bad and he was fired well you need to be fired then oh but
[03:09:28.840 --> 03:09:32.160]  I know you just want to get people fired who stand up for America you want to be
[03:09:32.160 --> 03:09:36.440]  able to take our liberties and our basic freedoms Max Kaiser has held over with
[03:09:36.440 --> 03:09:42.440]  us into overdrive here right now because we were getting into the economy
[03:09:42.440 --> 03:09:47.440]  but one more point on guns since he raised it yeah Nicole Simpson and Ron
[03:09:47.440 --> 03:09:52.520]  Goldman that was his name wasn't it they were both killed by someone wielding a
[03:09:52.520 --> 03:09:58.200]  knife we all know it wasn't OJ he's a wonderful person but the point is is
[03:09:58.200 --> 03:10:03.720]  that imagine if they would have had guns but you always read about this place
[03:10:03.720 --> 03:10:08.280]  with gun bands like London and Chicago and New York and LA where it's highly
[03:10:08.280 --> 03:10:11.820]  restricted people don't have guns somebody comes up with a knife and they
[03:10:11.820 --> 03:10:16.120]  stab you to death I mean somebody comes to me with a knife or somebody comes to
[03:10:16.120 --> 03:10:19.240]  most people in Texas people carrying guns you just pull it out and shoot them
[03:10:19.240 --> 03:10:24.080]  I mean it's like a joke it's like Indiana Jones and Raiders the Lost Ark
[03:10:24.080 --> 03:10:27.160]  where the guy's got the big sword and gonna chop his head off and does this
[03:10:27.160 --> 03:10:32.280]  fancy move and he just pulls out his revolver and shoots him criminals don't
[03:10:32.280 --> 03:10:36.000]  want you to be armed criminals support gun control because they want disarmed
[03:10:36.000 --> 03:10:41.320]  slaves and you know Bob Costas it's not his fault that he came and called for a
[03:10:41.320 --> 03:10:45.200]  ban on the Second Amendment on handguns it's the fault of the microphone I
[03:10:45.200 --> 03:10:50.120]  agree with Bob Costas guns are at fault spoons are at fault for fat people and
[03:10:50.120 --> 03:10:56.080]  Bob Costas his microphone is at fault I should I should and and and OJ is not
[03:10:56.080 --> 03:11:02.720]  at fault his knife is at fault OJ Simpson's knife is at fault and a guy
[03:11:02.720 --> 03:11:08.360]  killed his dad and some other people the dagger and a bow and arrow yesterday the
[03:11:08.360 --> 03:11:12.680]  bow and arrows at fault sorry Max Kaiser I'm kind of ranting off into that
[03:11:12.680 --> 03:11:16.360]  subject I'm beginning to understand the logic though that I am a racist because
[03:11:16.360 --> 03:11:22.320]  I'm against taking guns in fact Fox Sports Guy says your your your KKK I
[03:11:22.320 --> 03:11:26.520]  know KKK passed the first gun laws in the US so you'd actually the KKK is for
[03:11:26.520 --> 03:11:31.440]  gun control but doesn't matter I guess he's right history's wrong and spoons are
[03:11:31.440 --> 03:11:35.360]  evil sorry though I mean I guess they did dig out Alcatraz with a spoon at
[03:11:35.360 --> 03:11:39.320]  least in that place would maybe so maybe it is true I mean they say that you know
[03:11:39.320 --> 03:11:43.760]  zero dark 30s real to Easter Bunny's real sorry Max we got 10 minutes left in
[03:11:43.760 --> 03:11:47.920]  this segment you held over here's my question I pointed out can't we just
[03:11:47.920 --> 03:11:51.440]  arrest the globalist they've committed all the crimes MF global got caught
[03:11:51.440 --> 03:11:55.400]  lying stealing the money didn't get in trouble I mean if the law was in place
[03:11:55.400 --> 03:11:59.520]  they would all be going to jail but you just laughed and said well yeah but
[03:11:59.520 --> 03:12:03.120]  they'll all just fly to their island my point is they're getting the islands and
[03:12:03.120 --> 03:12:07.400]  digging in in Paraguay in places and I've talked to some of them you know top
[03:12:07.400 --> 03:12:10.520]  minions of these people they are scared of us and they don't think they're
[03:12:10.520 --> 03:12:14.240]  going to get away with it because they were so greedy none of them could even
[03:12:14.240 --> 03:12:17.760]  control themselves so I understand they're going to leave us with the system
[03:12:17.760 --> 03:12:24.120]  the predatory cannibalistic soylent green system but it is a good sign that
[03:12:24.120 --> 03:12:26.760]  they don't think they're going to get away with it or what's your point on
[03:12:26.760 --> 03:12:30.440]  that and how do we get out of this how do we bring them to justice I think we
[03:12:30.440 --> 03:12:35.280]  expose that they're the authors of this system and so that collectivism through
[03:12:35.280 --> 03:12:40.280]  corporate fascism is always discredited via the crony monopoly system they've
[03:12:40.280 --> 03:12:44.240]  created that they used to scapegoat the free market JP Morgan ran an ad about
[03:12:44.240 --> 03:12:48.160]  how they're free market and how they basically brought us America when they're
[03:12:48.160 --> 03:12:51.920]  the opposite of free market how do we defeat that so they can't demonize
[03:12:51.920 --> 03:12:58.320]  real free markets oh yeah before I forget wasn't Jimmy the Greek fired for
[03:12:58.320 --> 03:13:03.600]  alleged racist comments now if costus and his guru are saying that second
[03:13:03.600 --> 03:13:07.200]  amendment supporters are racist then using the Jimmy Greek standard that he
[03:13:07.200 --> 03:13:12.920]  should be fired well yeah the guy he quoted he said he endorsed the columns
[03:13:12.920 --> 03:13:19.400]  says that just inherently whites are racist and inherently gun owners are
[03:13:19.400 --> 03:13:25.520]  quote KKK no okay well they fired Jimmy the Greek for making allegedly racist
[03:13:25.520 --> 03:13:30.920]  comments so Bob costus has got to go so yeah the the the folks who are trading
[03:13:30.920 --> 03:13:37.200]  the billions out there who can get hop on an airplane and land anywhere and they
[03:13:37.200 --> 03:13:41.760]  I just sent you a story this was in Spiegel their Spiegel magazine this is a
[03:13:41.760 --> 03:13:46.320]  new study that came out shared traders are more reckless than psychopaths so
[03:13:46.320 --> 03:13:51.080]  it's incorrect to equate JP Morgan and Jamie Diamond to a psychopath he's much
[03:13:51.080 --> 03:13:56.880]  more reckless than a psychopath yes and and that's what the problem is is that
[03:13:56.880 --> 03:14:03.080]  you're dealing with much worse element than your common garden variety mass
[03:14:03.080 --> 03:14:09.400]  murderer you're dealing with somebody who's diseased to the point of there is
[03:14:09.400 --> 03:14:13.880]  very little that's in the case history of medical records that really classify
[03:14:13.880 --> 03:14:17.880]  the mind of a Jamie Diamond or a Lloyd Blank fine or some of these bankers here
[03:14:17.880 --> 03:14:22.840]  in London and they've taken serial you know the point was made that right you
[03:14:22.840 --> 03:14:27.240]  pointed at the top of the show that the current crisis has created devastation
[03:14:27.240 --> 03:14:32.040]  like a world war now on my show on Kaiser report I introduced I interviewed the
[03:14:32.040 --> 03:14:38.840]  former top regulator at H boss which was a bank here in the UK and he we talked
[03:14:38.840 --> 03:14:43.000]  about the financial Holocaust in fact yes this is like a world war and
[03:14:43.000 --> 03:14:47.960]  millions of people will die so Lloyd Blank fine is a holocaust provoker Jamie
[03:14:47.960 --> 03:14:52.520]  Diamond is a holocaust provoker they're responsible for the murder of millions
[03:14:52.520 --> 03:14:56.600]  of people because they're beyond psychopathic they're be there they're
[03:14:56.600 --> 03:15:04.880]  the worst most degenerate minds that this species have have ever put forward it
[03:15:04.880 --> 03:15:08.960]  and in many many millions of years of evolution this is what we've come to they
[03:15:08.960 --> 03:15:13.400]  are the alpha degenerate criminals who say they're doing God's work destroying
[03:15:13.400 --> 03:15:18.560]  the world economy and the proof is in the people committing suicide every day
[03:15:18.560 --> 03:15:22.280]  around the world as a result of their austerity measures that they put in
[03:15:22.280 --> 03:15:26.840]  place to pay themselves these bonuses I just got a story confirmed today the
[03:15:26.840 --> 03:15:32.560]  Papandreos the former head of Greece they just found 550 million euros in his
[03:15:32.560 --> 03:15:37.400]  mom's account remember that when they refused to do the referendum in Greece
[03:15:37.400 --> 03:15:42.280]  giving the people a chance to vote on the troika's takeover of Greece I said
[03:15:42.280 --> 03:15:46.000]  at the time this was for some kind of payoff and because there was a meeting
[03:15:46.000 --> 03:15:50.360]  with John Paulson Lloyd Blank fine of Goldman Sachs and Papandreos in Greece
[03:15:50.360 --> 03:15:54.240]  talking about destroying Greece and carving up what's left yeah I saw that
[03:15:54.240 --> 03:15:57.320]  I mean I saw that he should be immediately arrested but of course he
[03:15:57.320 --> 03:16:00.280]  won't be he'll probably be given a knighthood well that was the payoff so a
[03:16:00.280 --> 03:16:06.600]  5,000 years of democracy was traded for a 550 million dollar euro kickback to
[03:16:06.600 --> 03:16:10.680]  Papandreos he sold his country for that amount of money now we know that the
[03:16:10.680 --> 03:16:14.560]  proof is in now the figures they've got the numbers they've got the timing he
[03:16:14.560 --> 03:16:19.880]  he sold out Greece for that amount of money so that's beyond a pathology I
[03:16:19.880 --> 03:16:23.360]  mean that you're not even you know some of the worst tyrants ever in history
[03:16:23.360 --> 03:16:27.920]  would be and how are they getting away with it MacLatchy confirms and says
[03:16:27.920 --> 03:16:31.720]  al-Qaeda is being given missiles by the United States to attack all these
[03:16:31.720 --> 03:16:37.520]  countries like Syria I mean the government runs al-Qaeda well to get back
[03:16:37.520 --> 03:16:44.120]  to a recurring theme the all of these wars and terrorist and fact banking
[03:16:44.120 --> 03:16:49.720]  terrorists and and financial terrorism require money and the money comes from
[03:16:49.720 --> 03:16:52.880]  slush funds whether it's the shadow banking system which has now been raised
[03:16:52.880 --> 03:16:58.560]  from 62 trillion they just raised it up to 69 trillion is now believed to be in
[03:16:58.560 --> 03:17:05.120]  the shadow banking system and that exists entirely due to interest rates
[03:17:05.120 --> 03:17:09.360]  being near zero percent so the people who the central bankers who keep rates
[03:17:09.360 --> 03:17:12.200]  near zero percent that means if you're in the shadow banking system and you're
[03:17:12.200 --> 03:17:15.920]  running a war and you want to go invade a country and you need to borrow 10
[03:17:15.920 --> 03:17:20.160]  billion dollars you can do so and borrow that money for near zero percent
[03:17:20.160 --> 03:17:24.880]  interest and that's what fuels the malevolent aspects of society the
[03:17:24.880 --> 03:17:28.920]  cacocracy that the kleptocracy the worst elements of our society the sickest
[03:17:28.920 --> 03:17:33.080]  psychopaths in history are being fueled with borrowed money that they can borrow
[03:17:33.080 --> 03:17:37.880]  for zero percent imagine if you take a genghis Khan and you say again this
[03:17:37.880 --> 03:17:43.080]  here's the bank and we're going to let you borrow any amount of money for zero
[03:17:43.080 --> 03:17:46.320]  percent interest rate and you never have to pay back the interest just how much
[03:17:46.320 --> 03:17:50.600]  you need 10 billion 20 billion 30 billion the worst tyrants in history now
[03:17:50.600 --> 03:17:55.760]  we've given them carte blanche an open check blank check at zero percent
[03:17:55.760 --> 03:17:59.360]  interest rate so they're doing the worst things you could possibly imagine
[03:17:59.360 --> 03:18:03.160]  because they they have the all the money in the world to do the worst things and
[03:18:03.160 --> 03:18:07.360]  there's nobody suggesting that interest rate should be should be increased
[03:18:07.360 --> 03:18:12.400]  because they keep saying well we have to worry about deflation no that's not true
[03:18:12.400 --> 03:18:16.800]  you're causing the deflation they're causing this catastrophe with low
[03:18:16.800 --> 03:18:23.000]  interest rates to we know this this plague of banking terrorists you need
[03:18:23.000 --> 03:18:27.880]  to raise interest rates to increase the cost of funds so they can't afford to do
[03:18:27.880 --> 03:18:31.000]  what they're doing but that's not no one's gonna do that as a matter of fact
[03:18:31.000 --> 03:18:37.520]  they're dropping interest rates to below zero in Switzerland the rate on your
[03:18:37.520 --> 03:18:42.440]  savings account is now negative they make you pay to put money there because and
[03:18:42.440 --> 03:18:48.360]  again they have a a depression in the in the real economy but inflation in the
[03:18:48.360 --> 03:18:53.280]  goods a double whammy also they can give themselves free money amazing max
[03:18:53.280 --> 03:18:57.400]  Kaiser we've got 60 seconds left final comments
[03:18:57.400 --> 03:19:04.960]  well you know I'm whether my date it holds up my April date for a major
[03:19:04.960 --> 03:19:11.760]  major break possibly Japan we'll see I am no reason to move that date based on
[03:19:11.760 --> 03:19:17.400]  the increase in anxiety and pressures and gold purchased by central bank these
[03:19:17.400 --> 03:19:20.880]  things these things are coming together in real time I hope I'm correct because
[03:19:20.880 --> 03:19:26.240]  I'd like to go down you know on on your show as having called it to within a one
[03:19:26.240 --> 03:19:30.960]  week time period that's my goal to be the most prescient prognosticator of the
