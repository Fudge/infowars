[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:14.000]  Just a few months after being sworn in as president, John F. Kennedy, RFK Jr.'s uncle,
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000]  said the following in a speech given before the American Newspaper Publishers Association.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000]  The very word secrecy is repugnant in a free and open society.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:33.000]  And we are as a people, inherently and historically, opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths,
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000]  and to secret proceedings.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:43.000]  We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000]  far outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000]  On November 22nd, 1963, President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000]  There are hours of damning evidence clearly showing that the CIA, organized crime,
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.000]  and the highest levels of the U.S. federal government were all involved in the assassination of John F. Kennedy,
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.000]  including the magic bullet, the grassy knoll, and the presence of young CIA asset, George H.W. Bush,
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]  in Dallas that day, a day that he claims he could not remember.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000]  But the entire operation was blamed on a single lone gunman.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:34.000]  An hour after hearing that his brother was assassinated, Robert Kennedy told his close aide that he was surprised it wasn't him.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000]  He thought that he would be the one they would get.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000]  Over the next few days, he wrote letters to his children,
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.000]  charging them with the responsibility to love and serve their country and to remember what their Uncle John had started.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:57.000]  A few years later, the New York Times published an article claiming that President Kennedy told one of the highest officials in his administration
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000]  that he wanted to splinter the CIA in a thousand pieces and scatter it to the winds.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000]  On March 16th, 1968, Robert Kennedy officially announced he was running for president.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:20.000]  On June 5th, following major victories in the primaries, he was gunned down after giving a speech at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, California.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:28.000]  Nina Rhodes-Hughes was one of a small few who witnessed the assassination, and she claims there was another shooter.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]  She later expressed outrage that the police ignored her statement.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000]  The shot that killed Robert Kennedy was fired up close in the back of his head,
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000]  and the whole operation was blamed on a single lone gunman who was standing in front of him.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000]  Well, it appears that they concluded within about an hour's time that Saran acted alone,
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000]  or that was going to be their conclusion, and they thereafter tailored all of the evidence to fit that conclusion.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.000]  Regicide is the ritual killing of a king to memorialize a subversion of power.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:08.000]  And while the Kennedy family is as greasy as the rest of the swamp, the two brothers stand out like mythical kings.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:18.000]  Aside from Dr. Ron Paul, who said we need to get rid of them completely, nobody in government questions the crimes of the CIA.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:28.000]  While promoting a book on television in 1978, a young RFK Jr. referred to American politics as a one-party system,
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]  and his father and uncle's demise as an occupational hazard.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:42.000]  In March of 1999, John F. Kennedy Jr. had a meeting to plan a run for the 2000 U.S. Senate election against Hillary Clinton.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.000]  Four months later, he died in a fatal plane crash with all the telltale signs of a cover-up.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:04:00.000]  Recently declassified documents show that Lee Harvey Oswald, the alleged lone gunman in the JFK assassination, was a CIA asset.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:08.000]  RFK Jr. is running for president in 2024 and calls out the CIA for the deadly vaccines.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:17.000]  He also blames the CIA for the murder of his uncle, which he calls a successful coup d'etat from which our democracy has never recovered.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:26.000]  And he believes that his father was assassinated by the security guard who shot him from behind after pushing him into their patsy, Sirhan Sirhan.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.000]  One of the interesting things about this case is that Sirhan Sirhan was reportedly in front of Robert Kennedy,
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000]  and investigators initially said that he was murdered by a gunshot wound.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, you can find the full Greg Reese report at band.video.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:51.000]  And now RFK Jr. barnstorming against the swamp, and the mainstream media doesn't want to give his campaign any attention.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:59.000]  So we will make sure to do just that, an anti-establishment left and an anti-establishment right coming to the fore.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000]  Turbo Force is back, sold out for eight months, and it's Turbo Force Plus.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.000]  We made it even stronger. The strongest long term energy you're going to find anywhere.

[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000]  But this is the King Kong.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]  This is the boss.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]  Turbo Force back in stock.

[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:16.000]  And now your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:24.000]  Well, here we are on this Sunday evening, April 30th, twenty twenty three.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000]  Owen Troyer.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:38.000]  Honored to be sitting in for Alex Jones on this Sunday evening and glad to be spending it with you.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.000]  So we're looking at all the big news on this Sunday night.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000]  Wondering what the lead is.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.000]  And you've got a situation at the southern border that's about to get out of control.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000]  And breaking Jeffrey Epstein news, which is what we already knew.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000]  It just it just continues to come out with more receipts, more documents.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000]  They all knew what Jeffrey Epstein was doing.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000]  They all knew about his island.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000]  And yet they all continued to mingle because they were into it, too.
[00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:25.850]  And then there's a bunch of other news, and then right before we go live, new documents drop, and we have them at InfoWars.com.
[00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:37.850]  This is unbelievable, and we're kind of numb to it at this point, since we were speaking out against the vaccines.
[00:07:39.034 --> 00:07:48.034]  When Trump was president, and even the Democrats like Kamala Harris and Joe Biden, they were saying, I will never take Trump's vaccine.
[00:07:48.034 --> 00:07:53.034]  That's going to be a bad vaccine. You should not take Trump's vaccine. Now, now they promote the vaccine.
[00:07:53.034 --> 00:08:00.034]  Once Biden got into office, all of a sudden they were the major promoters of the vaccines and they were mandating the vaccines.
[00:08:00.034 --> 00:08:04.034]  The ingredients didn't change. The manufacturers didn't change. Nothing changed.
[00:08:04.034 --> 00:08:10.034]  Just Biden became president, now the vaccines were good. That's science. This is the party of science. That's their science.
[00:08:10.034 --> 00:08:16.034]  Trump president, vaccine bad. Biden president, vaccine good. Same vaccine. Science.
[00:08:16.034 --> 00:08:23.034]  But no, we shouldn't be so numb to this, because this is premeditated murder.
[00:08:23.034 --> 00:08:32.034]  This is a crime against humanity, and still to this day, nobody has been punished.
[00:08:32.034 --> 00:08:38.034]  And we've had all kinds of hearings. We've got all the documents. We've got all the science.
[00:08:38.034 --> 00:08:44.034]  There should be no doubt anymore. But the headline at Infowars.com right now, bombshell,
[00:08:44.034 --> 00:08:52.034]  Pfizer and FDA aggressively pushed COVID vaccine on pregnant women, despite knowing mRNA shot caused dire fatal,
[00:08:52.034 --> 00:08:58.034]  or excuse me, fetal and infant risks. Fatal, I guess I'm being Freudian slip here.
[00:08:59.034 --> 00:09:04.034]  Pfizer and the FDA knew by early 2021, like everybody else,
[00:09:04.034 --> 00:09:09.034]  that Pfizer's mRNA COVID vaccine resulted in horrible damage to fetuses and babies,
[00:09:09.034 --> 00:09:13.034]  according to the pharmaceutical company's own clinical trial documents.
[00:09:13.034 --> 00:09:16.034]  So do you see how frustrating this is?
[00:09:16.034 --> 00:09:20.034]  And here's the document right here that has just come out.
[00:09:20.034 --> 00:09:29.034]  Cumulative review from pharmacovigilance database, pregnancy and lactation, cumulative review.
[00:09:29.034 --> 00:09:35.034]  And this is the results from the vaccine. And again, this is this is linked up.
[00:09:36.034 --> 00:09:46.034]  You can find this at Infowars.com where this story derives from.
[00:09:46.034 --> 00:09:56.034]  Now, why? Why, despite knowing the risks, were they pushing the vaccines on Americans and specifically,
[00:09:56.034 --> 00:10:03.034]  in this case, pregnant women? Why? Is it because the government bought all these vaccines and they figured,
[00:10:03.034 --> 00:10:08.034]  well, we just got to get them into arms, safe or not, effective or not, doesn't matter.
[00:10:08.034 --> 00:10:13.034]  We got to get these vaccines into arms. Is that what it was?
[00:10:13.034 --> 00:10:19.034]  Well, that would be the more innocent, that would be the more innocent.
[00:10:19.034 --> 00:10:28.034]  Of potential scenarios here, or did they just want you to die?
[00:10:28.034 --> 00:10:32.034]  Is that it? I mean, there's your scale. There's your margins.
[00:10:32.034 --> 00:10:40.034]  Either they just said we bought all these vaccines, we got to get them into arms no matter what, or let's kill them.
[00:10:40.034 --> 00:10:46.034]  Maybe it's somewhere, maybe it's somewhere in there, but but that's your scale.
[00:10:46.034 --> 00:10:50.034]  We're numb to it. We've been talking about this since early 2021.
[00:10:50.034 --> 00:10:55.034]  Just like in the document, it says just like when they knew it.
[00:10:55.034 --> 00:11:04.034]  Oh, what is Pfizer going to say? What is the FDA going to say next time they get subpoenaed to testify to Congress?
[00:11:04.034 --> 00:11:08.034]  What are they going to say? Oh, we didn't look at the document.
[00:11:08.034 --> 00:11:15.034]  Oh, darn it. Rats. If only we would have seen the document.
[00:11:15.034 --> 00:11:20.034]  Of course we would not have pushed them on to pregnant mothers. That is our fault.
[00:11:21.034 --> 00:11:27.034]  Oh, did you even do the studies?
[00:11:27.034 --> 00:11:31.034]  Oh, you said safe and effective, but you never looked at the studies.
[00:11:31.034 --> 00:11:38.034]  No, folks, no, no. They knew exactly what they were doing.
[00:11:38.034 --> 00:11:42.034]  They knew exactly what they were doing.
[00:11:42.034 --> 00:11:53.034]  And now. You know, the good news is, I guess, that most of the people that even got one shot did not go back for their second.
[00:11:53.034 --> 00:12:03.034]  So. Really, at this point. You're in you're still in the trial, you are still the study.
[00:12:03.034 --> 00:12:09.034]  If you took the MRNA injection, if you took the COVID vaccine, you are still in a study.
[00:12:09.034 --> 00:12:13.034]  You are still being studied right now. You are still in a study.
[00:12:13.034 --> 00:12:19.034]  And it really won't conclude for five or even 10 years.
[00:12:19.034 --> 00:12:25.034]  But. We're not hearing as much about all the vaccine injuries and vaccine deaths.
[00:12:25.034 --> 00:12:28.034]  So maybe that's a good sign. Again, most people got it once.
[00:12:28.034 --> 00:12:33.034]  So maybe you're kind of through that trial of, you know, you're going to make it through this thing.
[00:12:33.034 --> 00:12:39.034]  But the side effects continue. The strokes are increasing. The heart attacks are increasing.
[00:12:39.034 --> 00:12:44.034]  Most people know somebody that have.
[00:12:44.034 --> 00:12:50.034]  Had a vaccine side effect. Most people, if not all at this point.
[00:12:50.034 --> 00:12:55.034]  I'm still hearing about it all the time. And they knew it.
[00:12:55.034 --> 00:13:05.034]  So who in Congress? Ron Johnson, Rand Paul. Marjorie Taylor Greene.
[00:13:05.034 --> 00:13:16.034]  Who in Congress is going to have enough tenacity and courage to actually go after the FDA?
[00:13:16.034 --> 00:13:20.034]  Really, that's what they should do first. Then you can go after Pfizer and the rest.
[00:13:20.034 --> 00:13:33.034]  But. Since it's Congress's job to have oversight over these federal bureaucracies, they need to go after the FDA first.
[00:13:33.034 --> 00:13:43.034]  They need to go after the FDA first and. Really, it should probably be shut down, but it's like, oh, my gosh.
[00:13:43.034 --> 00:13:50.034]  Infowars sells supplements. It aren't FDA approved. Oh, no.
[00:13:50.034 --> 00:13:57.034]  Well, OK, what about that shot the FDA approved that killed 100000 people in America?
[00:13:57.034 --> 00:14:06.034]  Oh, that's right. That's right. That's that's your loving FDA.
[00:14:06.034 --> 00:14:17.034]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You want to know why you want to know why America is so fat?
[00:14:17.034 --> 00:14:26.034]  You want to know why America is so unhealthy? Just ask the FDA.
[00:14:26.034 --> 00:14:37.034]  I wonder if you had a graph. You can obviously see United States obesity going up.
[00:14:37.034 --> 00:14:46.034]  We've we've all we've witnessed it. I bet you there's something that that coincides with over there at the FDA.
[00:14:46.034 --> 00:14:55.034]  The FDA. They're out there, the the Food and Drug Administration wants to protect you.
[00:14:55.034 --> 00:15:04.034]  Yes. Yes, yes, yes. That's why they recommended the covid-19 vaccine for pregnant women,
[00:15:04.034 --> 00:15:12.034]  despite knowing that it was going to have an extremely high risk factor.
[00:15:12.034 --> 00:15:21.034]  That's your FDA. Oh, but we're still waiting on the verdict for the proud boys trial.
[00:15:21.034 --> 00:15:29.034]  You know, the proud boys with their insurrection, you know, when they can't even organize a taco lunch.
[00:15:29.034 --> 00:15:34.034]  They can't even get together to organize a taco lunch. They can't even decide where to go get a cold beer half the time.
[00:15:34.034 --> 00:15:39.034]  They can't even get along to figure out where they want to go have a drink or have tacos in the middle of an insurrection.
[00:15:40.034 --> 00:15:43.034]  But over there at the FDA, they knew that shot was going to kill you.
[00:15:43.034 --> 00:15:48.034]  They knew that shot was bad for pregnant women and they still stuck it into your arm.
[00:15:48.034 --> 00:15:52.034]  And none of them are waiting on their verdicts. None of them are waiting on trial.
[00:15:52.034 --> 00:15:56.034]  None of them are sitting in the courtroom looking at a jury that determines their fate.
[00:15:56.034 --> 00:16:00.034]  That too belongs in the courtroom.
[00:16:00.034 --> 00:16:05.034]  Turbo Force is back, sold out for eight months and it's Turbo Force Plus.
[00:16:05.034 --> 00:16:11.034]  We made it even stronger. The strongest long term energy you're going to find anywhere.

[00:16:24.034 --> 00:16:26.034]  It should be called 10 hour energy.

[00:16:37.034 --> 00:16:43.034]  It is the super fuel. Rainforce Plus is great. Rainforce Ultra is great.
[00:16:43.034 --> 00:16:45.034]  They're two different nootropics. They go good with this.
[00:16:45.034 --> 00:16:49.034]  But this is the king Kong. This is the boss.
[00:16:49.034 --> 00:16:54.034]  Turbo Force, back in stock, discounted. Infowarsstore.com.
[00:16:54.034 --> 00:16:57.034]  More power, more strength, more energy.

[00:17:04.034 --> 00:17:12.034]  All the success that we've had together against the globalists and the fact that we're not caught flat footed during their major takeover is because of you.
[00:17:12.034 --> 00:17:15.034]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.

[00:17:43.034 --> 00:17:49.034]  I want to encourage those of you out there that want to support Freedom to take action now and be part of the global awakening,
[00:17:49.034 --> 00:17:56.034]  the new renaissance that's countering the great reset by going to Infowarsstore.com and clicking on the donate button and giving today.
[00:17:56.034 --> 00:17:58.034]  Thank you so much for your support.
[00:17:58.034 --> 00:17:59.034]  Please take action.
[00:17:59.034 --> 00:18:07.034]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on earth and they've got our children drinking that.
[00:18:07.034 --> 00:18:13.034]  This is a psychotic death cult, period, case closed, out to get you and your family.
[00:18:13.034 --> 00:18:18.034]  We sell the Alexa Pure Breeze made by the My Patriot Supply Ready Hour Group.
[00:18:18.034 --> 00:18:21.034]  It's been around about 15 years, became the biggest company in the last six.
[00:18:21.034 --> 00:18:31.034]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system out there that sells for twice the price and they made it as good in all the studies.
[00:18:31.034 --> 00:18:34.034]  It reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals.
[00:18:34.034 --> 00:18:36.034]  But you can go pay two or three times.
[00:18:36.034 --> 00:18:38.034]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[00:18:39.034 --> 00:18:44.034]  We sell the very best, highest grade water filtration system for half the price of the leading competitor.
[00:18:44.034 --> 00:18:50.034]  And the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter your water.
[00:18:50.034 --> 00:18:51.034]  You should also filter your shower water.
[00:18:51.034 --> 00:18:53.034]  That's another way you absorb this crap.
[00:18:53.034 --> 00:18:54.034]  But I'm done talking about that.
[00:18:54.034 --> 00:18:57.034]  The point is you get the filters at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:18:57.034 --> 00:18:58.034]  They're discounted right now.
[00:18:58.034 --> 00:18:59.034]  Finally back in stock.
[00:18:59.034 --> 00:19:03.034]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[00:19:03.034 --> 00:19:08.034]  I want you all to know something.
[00:19:08.034 --> 00:19:10.034]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:19:10.034 --> 00:19:14.034]  Alex is right about far more than he's wrong.
[00:19:14.034 --> 00:19:17.034]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[00:19:17.034 --> 00:19:21.034]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down.
[00:19:21.034 --> 00:19:23.034]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:19:23.034 --> 00:19:27.034]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[00:19:27.034 --> 00:19:31.034]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[00:19:31.034 --> 00:19:34.034]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[00:19:34.034 --> 00:19:35.034]  Years ago.
[00:19:35.034 --> 00:19:37.034]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax.
[00:19:37.034 --> 00:19:39.034]  Not for a second.
[00:19:39.034 --> 00:19:42.034]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[00:19:42.034 --> 00:19:44.034]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[00:19:44.034 --> 00:19:47.034]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[00:19:47.034 --> 00:19:52.034]  That's why the globalists hate me is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:06.980]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.

[00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:51.220]  .
[00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:54.220]  .
[00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:57.220]  .
[00:32:57.220 --> 00:33:00.220]  .
[00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:03.220]  .
[00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:06.220]  .
[00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:09.220]  .
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:27.160]  You found it, the tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:34.160]  Well, Carrie Lake gets it. If I had 100 people in Congress like Carrie Lake, or if I had
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:38.160]  governors like Carrie Lake, and this is why, you know, they couldn't let her get in, I
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:42.160]  think the country would be going in a better direction.
[00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:48.160]  Carrie Lake gets it. She tweeted this out moments ago with an Anthony Fauci clip from
[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:52.160]  CNN over the weekend saying, we need to get away from the blame game.
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:56.160]  Oh, Fauci doesn't want to play the blame game.
[00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:59.160]  Why would that be? I can't imagine.
[00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:03.160]  Fauci tells CNN we need to get away from the blame game.
[00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:08.160]  Yeah, yeah. Like five people dead at the scene of a crime.
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:11.160]  And you're standing there with a bloody knife over their bodies.
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:15.160]  Hey, hey, hey, well, let's not look into blaming people for anything.
[00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:20.160]  Yeah. Says the guy with the bloody knife with his five stab victims.
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:24.160]  Oh, yeah. Carrie Lake says we're not seeking blame.
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:32.160]  We're seeking justice. Anthony Fauci should be in jail for what he did to us for life.
[00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:36.160]  Cue the round of applause, please.
[00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:44.160]  And you see, this is why it's so important, because we have politicians that.
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:51.160]  I'm not going to curse because it's the Lord's Day on Sunday, but we have politicians that are cowards.
[00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:53.160]  Sure, we have ones that are corrupt. That's fine.
[00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:58.160]  We expect that. But it's the cowardly ones that are the problem.
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:03.160]  It's the ones that aren't corrupted, but that are cowardly and won't say the truth because they're so afraid.
[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:06.160]  Not Carrie Lake.
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:14.160]  Not Carrie Lake. There's not enough of them, but that's why they couldn't let her be in office.
[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:17.160]  You see that now, don't you? You see that now.
[00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:24.160]  But, oh, this is why they attack the First Amendment, folks, because they don't want you to be able to criticize them when they commit crimes.
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:31.160]  They don't want you to be able to share the evidence of their crimes, just like with the Hunter Biden laptop.
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:35.160]  So they censor you.
[00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:41.160]  And they want to live in a one world government where that's their duty and that's their ability and they can censor and silence you.
[00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:45.160]  No problem at all. And if you really get.
[00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:51.160]  If you really get nasty with them, they've got the they've got the microchip in your arm, they'll just shut you down completely.
[00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:57.160]  Can't start your car, can't open your door, can't buy your groceries.
[00:35:57.160 --> 00:36:04.160]  So you need to go to your government building and get your shot of lithium to calm down.
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:08.160]  You need some lithium.
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:13.160]  It's all it's all their globalist nightmare.
[00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:18.160]  That we will not be.
[00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:25.160]  We will not be going in to that dark night quietly.
[00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:32.160]  No, I don't think so. In fact, I would say the awakening is on and I could talk for hours about that.
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:36.160]  You may be witnessing it, too. And I've got some videos, I've got some news stories on it.
[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:44.160]  I mean, the average person now sees that the American left, the Democrat Party under Joe Biden is just one of a handful of things,
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:49.160]  completely incompetent, complete liars, complete frauds, complete phonies.
[00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:54.160]  And now they're starting to realize probably the source of most of the problems we have in this country.
[00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:57.160]  That that that can't that that that that's that's done.
[00:36:57.160 --> 00:37:01.160]  They're not going to be able to put that back in the bag. And so that's what I'm saying.
[00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:11.160]  When Joe Biden gets 500 million votes in 2024, I mean, it's going to be so ludicrous.
[00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:17.160]  So it's like we either completely turn over to the totalitarian state at that point.
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:25.160]  Or we just fundamentally reject everything that the U.S. government tries to do and tries to pull.
[00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:29.160]  Now, before I go on, ladies and gentlemen, we are funded by you in the audience.
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:31.160]  And that's why we don't have to censor ourselves.
[00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:37.160]  And that's why we don't censor ourselves or our guests, is because we are supported by you in the audience.
[00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:40.160]  Truly the biggest grassroots news organization in the world.
[00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:43.160]  And I guess that's why they have to ban us everywhere. But we've got great products.
[00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:51.160]  And then for store.com, in fact, myself, I got into the office today and I was pilfering through.
[00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:56.160]  You know, we've got a bunch of boxes of products and we've got places where we shoot commercials and everything.
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:38:03.160]  And I was pilfering through looking for some fizzy magnesium as I was out and about a little late last night.
[00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:11.160]  So I needed to get I needed to get some magnesium back into my body for that good enzyme function.
[00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:15.160]  But the truth is, I really just like the taste. That's actually the truth.
[00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:19.160]  I might pretend I'm doing it for health benefits, which it has many.
[00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:23.160]  But I actually just like the taste. I just love the taste.
[00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:28.160]  I remember I don't know if they still make this, but it tastes like Tang.
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:32.160]  If you drink Tang growing up, me and my dad love Tang.
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:37.160]  Just that that flavor. This is almost the exact same flavor, but it's totally healthy, all natural.
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:43.160]  And the fizzy magnesium drink mix right now is 25 percent off at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:49.160]  One of the great products we have, one of my favorite products, fizzy magnesium.

[00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:06.160]  All right. You know, we have a big border situation that's about to be rearing its ugly head.
[00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:10.160]  We've got mass caravans heading to the southern border right now.
[00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:12.160]  Already tens of thousands are starting to land.
[00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:20.160]  And then once the Title 42, I think it was once that expires, it's it's game on.
[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:25.160]  And they tried to pose, they're like, hey, we're shutting down the Darien Gap.
[00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:32.160]  The Biden administration, because they knew about two million illegal immigrants were about to head to the southern border this year.
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:37.160]  They were expecting about a million illegal immigrants this this spring into summer.
[00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:41.160]  That's when you get the most activity. And they were expecting about a million.
[00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:48.160]  And so. They said, we've got to put a yellow light on this or a red light on this.
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:54.160]  This is this is just crazy now. And so they said the Dorian Gap is shut down.
[00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:59.160]  Do not come here. Do not come through the through the Darien Gap, excuse me, the Darien Gap.
[00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:03.160]  Well, we have intel from people that go to the Darien Gap regularly.
[00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:07.160]  A lot of them have been guests on the show. And the truth is, it's not shut down.
[00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:11.160]  The problem that they're having is it's so overflowing and overwhelmed.
[00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:15.160]  I mean, you're talking about this place is in the middle of the jungle.
[00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:22.160]  And all the millions of these people have to go to this one little facility, if you can even call it that.
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:25.160]  It's one little camp. And yes, and they get a Biden T-shirt.
[00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:32.160]  It's like you get it's like a parting gift. It's like, OK, you just you just spent your your night.
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:39.160]  It's like a trip to Disney World. You just spent your night inside the Biden Darien Gap border facility.
[00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:46.160]  The illegal immigration pipeline. Supplied by Joe Biden and the federal government.
[00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:53.160]  Here's your you get a little you get a little gift bag, here's your Biden T-shirt, here's your prepaid debit card.
[00:40:53.160 --> 00:41:01.160]  They give you a nice little envelope with instructions, bus tickets, plane tickets, a little parting gift for you.
[00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:06.160]  Very nice. Very nice. So that story is about to rear its ugly head.
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:11.160]  There's going to be no way for them to put that story away.
[00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:15.160]  But hey, it's just every year under Joe Biden, this happens.
[00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:21.160]  So who cares? Twenty twenty one. It was out of control. It was record highs.
[00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:25.160]  Twenty twenty two. Same thing. It's twenty twenty three.
[00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:30.160]  We're going for new records, which there likely will be.
[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:35.160]  Since the word is out that the southern border is open and there's free goodies.
[00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:40.160]  It's like a treasure hunt. Why would people.
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:45.160]  Trek thousands of miles through jungles.
[00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:51.160]  To get to the U.S. southern border. Well, because there's a free treasure waiting.
[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:59.160]  And it's not like they're coming here for a new life where they can be free and they have an idea that they want to make something or build something or work at something or work somewhere.
[00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:04.160]  No, they're just coming here with no prospects, hoping for free stuff.
[00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:10.160]  And that's how it goes. And then they sit in, they fill up these hotels that we pay for.
[00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:15.160]  And they just fill them up until they find somewhere to go.
[00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:21.160]  And this gets documented every year and it'll happen again this year.
[00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:29.160]  Chicago officials say city facing humanitarian crisis amid renewed illegal surge.
[00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:34.160]  Chicago. So they fly them to Chicago. But of course, this is Democrat run Chicago.
[00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:38.160]  That's a sanctuary city for illegal immigrants. So that's where they belong.
[00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:43.160]  You guys voted for the illegal immigrants to be in your city.
[00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:50.160]  Don't complain about how many illegal immigrants you have. You asked for this.
[00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:54.160]  Same thing in New York, too. It's like we don't know what to do with all these illegal immigrants.
[00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:59.160]  Well, you put them there. So why don't you close the border? You ever think of that?
[00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:05.160]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson and take him off the air.
[00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:10.160]  People said, no way is the most powerful ever happened. They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:13.160]  They only had to cross on the air because they believe they can control him.
[00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:16.160]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:24.160]  It's the same thing with Infowars. But Infowars is not owned by Fox or controlled by George Soros or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:30.160]  We are only beholden to our viewers, our listeners. And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:35.160]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:40.160]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people. So I want to thank you for your support.
[00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:46.160]  Please don't take Infowars for granted. We're barely hanging on.
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:52.160]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support while getting great products at the same time at Infowars.com.
[00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:59.160]  So don't procrastinate. Go to Infowars.com. Get amazing products that keep us on the air and never submit to these tyrants.
[00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:05.160]  I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had. I don't think anybody can deny it.
[00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:09.160]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:18.160]  When we talk about the crew at Infowars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:25.160]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week.
[00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:30.160]  It's really just incredible. So for myself, the whole Infowars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:36.160]  I only encourage you now to realize that Infowars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:40.160]  I know you spread the word. I know you pray for us. That's wonderful. Keep doing it.
[00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:48.160]  But most viewers and listeners never go to Infowars.com and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life while at the same time keeping us on air.
[00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:52.160]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at Infowars.com.
[00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:59.160]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to Infowars.com, our funding problems will be over. Please take action now.
[00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:06.160]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mugshot because they knew that that would help Trump.
[00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:09.160]  Didn't they know this would backfire? We were waiting for the mugshot.
[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:12.160]  We learned today they wouldn't have it, so we've made our own.
[00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:17.160]  And it says political prisoner with an image of President Trump.
[00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:21.160]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas. It'll be shipping out to you in one week.
[00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:28.160]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front there in a mugshot jail background.
[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:29.160]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:33.160]  It says Infowars.com on the back of the shirt.
[00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:35.160]  We also have Alex Jones for president.
[00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:36.160]  No, I'm not running for president.
[00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:38.160]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt.
[00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:39.160]  Red, white and blue.
[00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:40.160]  Alex Jones for president.
[00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:41.160]  24.
[00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:43.160]  It's a fun conversational piece and a limited edition shirt.
[00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:45.160]  Great way to fund the operation.
[00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:58.160]  So get your Alex Jones for president and Trump mugshot shirts at Infowars.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:07.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and War for the World, is a historic book that documents the globalist in their own words plan for our future.
[00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:08.160]  That is a hellish future.
[00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:18.160]  Now, you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and War for the World at bookstores, Amazon or Infowars.com.
[00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:24.160]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:26.160]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:32.160]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World, a signed copy at Infowars.com.
[00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:36.160]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:39.160]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book.
[00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:42.160]  You'll also know that you help keep Infowars on the air.
[00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:46.160]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned copies.
[00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:56.160]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to Infowars.com and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate to the library or give them to the local school.
[00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:59.160]  This is an Infowar. I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:06.160]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:39.040]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:40.040]  I'm going to be your host for this week.
[00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:41.040]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:09.040]  He's smart.
[00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:10.040]  He's well-spoken.
[00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:15.160]  He understands the real issues, and he represents the anti-establishment left that used to be
[00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:22.000]  more common in the Democrat Party, wanting to at least scale back these federal bureaucracies
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:26.960]  like the FBI and the CIA, if not completely shut them down.
[00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:34.600]  Here's a definitely leftist talk show host, Charlemagne, calls DNC whack for not allowing
[00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:36.680]  Biden primary challenges.
[00:51:37.279 --> 00:51:41.880]  Oh, the Democrats are rigging their election again?
[00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:43.440]  What is the deal with liberals, though?
[00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:48.400]  Seriously, what is the deal with their minds that it takes them so long to learn the lesson?
[00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:52.279]  It's like somebody comes up and slaps you once in the face.
[00:51:52.279 --> 00:51:54.040]  You're like, hey, you just slapped me in the face.
[00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:57.720]  And if they rear back to hit you again, you think, oh, I'm going to get out of the way
[00:51:57.720 --> 00:51:58.760]  or I'm going to block this.
[00:51:58.760 --> 00:51:59.760]  I don't want to get slapped again.
[00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:02.480]  No, with them, it's like, oh, you just slapped me.
[00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:04.200]  Hey, you just slapped me again.
[00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:06.120]  Hey, did you just slap me again?
[00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:07.800]  Hey, I just got slapped again.
[00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:08.319]  Whoa, whoa.
[00:52:08.319 --> 00:52:09.160]  Why are you slapping me?
[00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:10.520]  Stop this.
[00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:12.040]  They rigged it from Bernie.
[00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:13.560]  Charlemagne said nothing.
[00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:15.040]  They rigged it from Bernie again.
[00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:17.720]  Charlemagne said nothing.
[00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:22.080]  Now, though, OK, hey, the DNC is rigging elections here.
[00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:23.240]  Wait a second.
[00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:29.279]  Oh, but you don't want to be called an insurrectionist, do you?
[00:52:29.279 --> 00:52:32.760]  You you you don't want to be called an election denier, do you?
[00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:37.279]  You don't want to be put on a federal government watch list, do you?
[00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:39.360]  You don't want to get indicted, do you?
[00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:42.640]  You don't want to lose your social media platforms, do you?
[00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:45.480]  You don't want to lose your big media contracts, do you?
[00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:48.520]  So shut the hell up about rigged elections.
[00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:53.279]  Unless a Democrat loses, then go ahead and and make a fuss.
[00:52:57.120 --> 00:53:00.560]  You can go anywhere right now.
[00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:03.760]  And ask the average person filling their tank with gas or.
[00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:08.400]  At a grocery store, getting their groceries and say, hey,
[00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:11.400]  you know, how do you feel about Joe Biden?
[00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:13.920]  You really think you're going to get a lot of positive response there?
[00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:21.800]  No. No, I don't think so.
[00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:24.640]  Only I mean, let's be real.
[00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:27.680]  Only the dumbest people in America.
[00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:29.560]  I don't even know if dumb is the word.
[00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:32.600]  Ignorant. Brainwashed.
[00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:36.760]  Only the most ignorant, brainwashed people in the country
[00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:40.200]  would still tell you that they like Joe Biden or say he's doing a good job.
[00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:45.960]  Or really, sadly, it's the most hateful people
[00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:49.319]  because they hate you or they hate Donald Trump so much
[00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:53.360]  that they just have to gaslight you and they know if they
[00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:57.279]  tell you how great Biden is, that's going to make you mad.
[00:54:00.279 --> 00:54:01.720]  But it's true, it's true.
[00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:04.800]  If you want to anger a liberal, tell them the truth.
[00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:07.800]  If you want to anger a conservative, lie to them.
[00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:10.680]  It's just true. It's just it.
[00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:12.200]  You can test it for yourself.
[00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:14.480]  I've been doing it for a decade now. It's true.
[00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:16.600]  If you want to anger a liberal, tell them the truth.
[00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:20.279]  If you want to anger a conservative, lie to them.
[00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:24.360]  But that's why it's so frustrating when they lied to us about the vaccines.
[00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:27.440]  That's why it's so frustrating when they lied to you about RFK, Jr.
[00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:29.400]  and censor his interviews.
[00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:34.800]  On ABC News, because I actually get mad at that.
[00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:40.920]  I get mad at Lindsey Davis from ABC News for lying to the American people.
[00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:43.680]  That really makes me mad.
[00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:49.120]  I get mad when they tell you a vaccine is safe and effective
[00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:51.520]  for pregnant mothers when they know it's not.
[00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:54.520]  I get mad when they say a vaccine is safe and effective for all Americans
[00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:56.640]  and it kills tens of thousands of people.
[00:54:56.680 --> 00:54:58.440]  That makes me mad.
[00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:07.240]  Senator Chris Coons says Kamala Harris is ready to run and ready to be president.
[00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:09.560]  Oh, we've got some disarray here because.
[00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:17.000]  Kamala Harris has come out, she's behind Joe Biden, she's fully behind Joe Biden,
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:18.720]  or at least Biden seems to think so.
[00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:24.880]  Because he's telling you how him and Kamala are coming back to finish the job
[00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:27.000]  and Kamala says she's going to be with Joe.
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:30.000]  She's back in with Joe, even though they don't get along.
[00:55:31.279 --> 00:55:34.319]  And Biden only chose her as a safety net, a safety valve.
[00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:36.080]  Hey, hey, you're going to get rid of me.
[00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:37.319]  You're going to impeach me.
[00:55:37.319 --> 00:55:40.080]  Really? You want that dingbat running the country? OK.
[00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:45.960]  And to which, of course, they say, yikes, we better not impeach him.
[00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:48.680]  We don't want that dingbat running the country.
[00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:52.400]  Honestly, as bad as Joe Biden is and as corrupt as he is,
[00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:55.880]  it might be safer than Kamala Harris, because.
[00:55:57.560 --> 00:56:02.440]  I mean, at least Joe Biden will try in some semblance to keep the lid on things.
[00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:04.240]  Kamala gets in, the lid is off.
[00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:05.480]  It's just forget about it.
[00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:09.160]  Done. Clown world unleashed.
[00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:16.520]  Can you imagine it's like a Kareem Jean-Pierre presidency?
[00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:20.960]  Geez, that's Joe Biden's safety net.
[00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:21.880]  It's Kamala Harris.
[00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:26.640]  He knows they'll never impeach him no matter how many crimes get exposed.
[00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:32.160]  They'll never impeach Joe Biden because Kamala Harris is in line behind him.
[00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:33.920]  It's the greatest safety net of all time.
[00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:35.680]  He's a political genius. You got to give it to him.
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:39.400]  So what is Chris Coons doing rattling the cage?
[00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:44.880]  Yes, but you know, there's are you know, there's an internal debate
[00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:47.400]  with the Democrats right now, they don't want Joe Biden.
[00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:51.279]  Biden's just he's he puts on his aviators,
[00:56:51.279 --> 00:56:55.240]  he says, F you, I'm running again, nobody wants him.
[00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:56.120]  It doesn't matter.
[00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:05.560]  And he's got Kamala Harris as his safety net, it's just brilliant, it's just brilliant.
[00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:14.640]  Senator Ron Johnson, new emails show Tony Blinken lied to U.S.
[00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:16.760]  Senate under oath about meeting with Hunter Biden.
[00:57:17.319 --> 00:57:20.760]  How much you want to bet Tony Blinken gets away with perjury?
[00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:26.680]  Yeah, because some people are above the law, mainly Democrats.
[00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:30.200]  So Joe Biden commits all the crimes.
[00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:32.840]  He doesn't get impeached because he's got Kamala Harris behind him.
[00:57:32.840 --> 00:57:37.319]  And Tony Blinken perjures himself, lies under oath, and he's not going to get indicted
[00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:41.560]  because he is part of the Biden administration and he's above the law.
[00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:45.880]  But I don't know, maybe Ron Johnson and others will actually do something about this.
[00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:47.000]  But I wouldn't hold my breath.
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:52.360]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to
[00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:55.840]  InfoWarsTore.com and gotten the great products that enrich your life,
[00:57:55.840 --> 00:57:58.760]  that empower your immune system in your body and keep us on air.
[00:57:59.080 --> 00:58:03.800]  I am humbly, hand in hand, talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in,
[00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:07.080]  many of you for years and never gone to InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:11.960]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you never actually go to
[00:58:11.960 --> 00:58:15.560]  InfoWarsTore.com and never experienced the benefits of the products that we
[00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:19.319]  offer. You go to InfoWarsTore.com and never experienced these great products and never found the operation.
[00:58:19.480 --> 00:58:22.400]  Sure, you share a link, you share an article, you tell folks about the show.
[00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:25.440]  That's great. And I thank you. But we need funds to operate.
[00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:29.640]  Plus, we've got really great products that do amazing things for people like our CBD oil
[00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:33.800]  and our fizzy magnesium and our sleep aid and our nitric oxide and our real red pill.
[00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:36.760]  Plus, all of these are really great products that keep us on air.
[00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:38.480]  Plus, you're missing out on having these products.
[00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:43.640]  So get off the bench, get in the game, step to the plate and go to InfoWarsTore.com
[00:58:43.640 --> 00:58:47.600]  right now and get these great InfoWars products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:59:13.640 --> 00:59:17.840]  ...engineered the fancy best water filter system out there that sells for twice the price.
[00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:21.440]  And they made it as good in all the studies.
[00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:24.680]  It reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals.
[00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:26.279]  But you can go pay two or three times.
[00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:28.840]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:34.240]  We sell the very best, highest grade water filtration system for half the price of a leading competitor.
[00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:39.960]  And the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter your water.
[00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:41.600]  You should also filter your shower water.
[00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:43.000]  That's another way you absorb this crap.
[00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:44.680]  But I'm done talking about that.
[00:59:44.680 --> 00:59:47.400]  The point is you get the filters at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:49.360]  They're discounted right now, finally back in stock.
[00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:57.400]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:05.279 --> 01:00:09.360]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report.
[01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:13.680]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:17.400]  And now your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:23.920]  So the corporate media is trying to suppress the campaign and the message of RFK Jr.
[01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:32.200]  So we will be the anti-corrupt corporate press and we will amplify RFK's message.
[01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:37.360]  And so here were some powerful moments from an interview he had this weekend talking about the vaccines.
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:40.840]  You've been opposed to vaccines now for a long time.
[01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:42.960]  Very heavily critical of the Covid vaccine.
[01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:43.720]  That's not true.
[01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:49.080]  Well, you're not a vaccine denier, but you are a very, very sceptical,
[01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:52.640]  very public voice of scepticism about the efficacy of vaccines.
[01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:53.279]  Would that be fair?
[01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:58.080]  What I've said is vaccines, I'm not anti-vaccine.
[01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:05.319]  I think vaccines should be subject to the same level of rigorous testing as other medications.
[01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:07.960]  And that is the only thing, my only position.
[01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:14.560]  Listen, I fought to get mercury out of fish for 40 years and nobody called me anti-fish.
[01:01:15.279 --> 01:01:18.440]  I'm not anti-vaccines just because I want safe vaccines.
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.040]  And I think everybody wants safe vaccines.
[01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:27.200]  And as we all now recognize, the Covid vaccines were neither safe nor effective.
[01:01:27.279 --> 01:01:34.640]  Well, that is, but that is, but that is, as you know, heavily disputed by a lot of top scientists
[01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:37.680]  who say that comparative to other vaccines, it was very safe.
[01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:40.560]  Obviously, like all vaccines, it's had issues.
[01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:45.520]  Obviously, they had to move at the speed of light because it was a novel virus that was killing a lot of people.
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:47.840]  But it wasn't an unsafe vaccine.
[01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:52.960]  If you look at the countries that did not vaccinate, they had the lowest death rates.
[01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:55.360]  They had the lowest Covid infection rates.
[01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:59.319]  And if you look at the Johns Hopkins data, which is the data everybody relies on,
[01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:09.040]  there's a direct correlation between excess deaths in nations, in the Western nations that heavily vaccinated and the level of Covid vaccination.
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:16.880]  So if you look at excess deaths, how many people, how many people died that shouldn't have died at the end of the year?
[01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:21.120]  The vaccine cause is associated because we don't know.
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:23.240]  We can't say cause because it's a correlation.
[01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:32.920]  But the big, the hot, the deaths in the nations that heavily vaccinated, which were much higher than those identified, I'll give you an example.
[01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:38.000]  We in our country are the most have one of the most heavily vaccinated countries in the world.
[01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:41.200]  We also have the highest Covid death rate in the world.
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:45.360]  So we had we have four point two percent of the global population.
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:47.920]  We have 16 percent of the Covid deaths.
[01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:50.000]  That's not a success story.
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:53.600]  How can anybody point to that and say, you know, the vaccines were a benefit?
[01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:54.600]  Listen, we've run out of time.
[01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:56.000]  I certainly don't look at it.
[01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:57.040]  Listen, I've got to end it.
[01:02:57.720 --> 01:03:08.040]  We have fourteen hundred studies, peer reviewed studies published on NIH's website, PubMed, linking various vaccines to all of those injuries.
[01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:09.600]  So what are they doing this for money?
[01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:15.319]  Well, they're making sixty billion dollars a year selling us vaccines.
[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:25.680]  But they're making five hundred billion dollars a year selling the remedies for the injuries caused by vaccines, the diabetes medication,
[01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:36.560]  the Adderall, the Ritalin, the Concerta, the Advair inhalers, the albuterol inhalers, the anti-seizure medications, all of those.
[01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:43.279]  You know, this is a really great business plan for these companies to make people sick and then you'd sell them a lifetime cure.
[01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:45.920]  Measles, they weren't making any money.
[01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:53.800]  If you get measles or chicken pox, the cure is chicken soup and vitamin A and you can't patent either of those.
[01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:56.240]  And you're well in a week.
[01:03:56.279 --> 01:03:59.000]  There's self-limiting illnesses that go away in a week.
[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:08.920]  But if you can give somebody that vaccine and make them, you know, diabetic for life and you got a permanent customer or ADD or ADHD.
[01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:14.200]  And, you know, many of the vaccines are for illnesses for which there is zero risk.
[01:04:14.359 --> 01:04:22.480]  And one day old baby has zero risk of getting hepatitis B if his mother doesn't have it, which every mother is tested for.
[01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:28.120]  You can only get it from, you know, unprotected sex or from sharing needles.
[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:34.720]  Why are we giving one day old babies a vaccine for hepatitis B and they admit the vaccine only lasts five years?
[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:39.319]  That baby is not going to have sex with a prostitute in the first five years of life.
[01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:40.760]  There's zero risk.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.359]  And yet it's a very, very dangerous vaccine.
[01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:51.480]  Yeah, I mean, I could make a joke about that unless they go to a gay pride parade or a Joe Biden event or Epstein Island.
[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:58.680]  But all jokes aside, RFK knows his stuff, folks, and the anti-establishment left finally has a real voice and a real leader.
[01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:04.080]  InfoWars. Tomorrow's news today.
[01:05:04.399 --> 01:05:09.520]  This is their big move. So, yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States?
[01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:12.800]  He doesn't care. That's not his job.
[01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:14.600]  He's not the president of the United States.
[01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:17.319]  He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:22.359]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased.
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.279]  They must be opposed.
[01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:27.600]  And that's why autocrats only understand one word.
[01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:30.680]  No, no, no.
[01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:34.480]  Exactly. And that's why we say no to your vaccines.
[01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:38.319]  We say no to you shutting down our businesses.
[01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:40.880]  We say no to you taking our firearms.
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.359]  We say no to you censoring our free speech.
[01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:46.960]  We say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization.
[01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:49.520]  We say no to you getting us into World War Three.
[01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:53.080]  You're right. We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden.
[01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:54.920]  And we say no.
[01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:56.800]  And we say no to your war.
[01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:09.840]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:06:10.279 --> 01:06:16.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show and now your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:22.720]  And Patrick Howley joins me fighting against the corrupt corporate press.
[01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:28.200]  And we've got news on the Epstein saga here.
[01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:32.960]  Private calendar reveals convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein met with Biden's CIA
[01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:37.359]  spy chief and other leftist individuals after sex crimes convictions.
[01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:41.800]  Let's not forget his bodyguard went and got trained by the CIA, too, and he served
[01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:46.040]  that light prison sentence while the Democrats were just waiting for him to get back
[01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:49.040]  out so they could go on the pony rides there at Epstein Island.
[01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:52.720]  So it's amazing the corporate press tried to silence this story.
[01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:59.120]  We've seen the hot tape of Amy Rohrbach at ABC News saying, yeah, I was going to
[01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:02.000]  cover the Epstein story, but they told me I couldn't do it because I had to protect
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:06.359]  the Clintons. I think that would be a bigger story, but they all covered it up.
[01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:10.040]  And, you know, you got to give the you got to give the liberal left credit.
[01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:14.319]  They really do protect their own, even if they're sex trafficking minors like
[01:07:14.319 --> 01:07:15.960]  Jeffrey Epstein. Amazing stuff.
[01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:20.480]  Patrick Howley. How does the corporate press get away with this?
[01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:21.640]  How do they get away with this?
[01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:26.600]  Why is everybody with an Epstein connection not being called in for investigations
[01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:27.920]  and testimonies right now?
[01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:33.760]  You know why, Owen, because it's called the Mockingbird Media, the CIA set up
[01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:38.000]  something called Project Mockingbird and they do the Mockingbird Media.
[01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:42.720]  All of these networks, all these years, you always thought, oh, it's it's Tom
[01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:47.080]  Brokaw says it or Dan Rather says it's the Mockingbird Media.
[01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:48.160]  It's all the CIA.
[01:07:48.319 --> 01:07:53.680]  We know now it's a matter of public record that the CIA was involved in 9-11.
[01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:56.240]  Alex Jones has been saying this for years.
[01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:58.960]  Now we have the Epstein private calendar revealed.
[01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:03.920]  William Burns of the CIA is part of the Epstein network.
[01:08:04.359 --> 01:08:08.760]  Catherine Rumler of Goldman Sachs, a member of the Rothschild dynasty.
[01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:10.399]  Henry Kissinger's consultant.
[01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:12.440]  We already knew about Woody Allen.
[01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:14.680]  We already knew about Chelsea Handler.
[01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:18.720]  We already knew about Harvey Weinstein, the guy who they would think in the Oscars
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:20.200]  acceptance speech all the time.
[01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:23.960]  We already knew about Bill Gates, the guy who dreamed up this scandemic.
[01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:26.240]  We already knew about Jeffrey Lander.
[01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:29.320]  OK, Biden's top White House science adviser.
[01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:33.240]  We already know that Ghislaine Maxwell is the daughter of Israeli spy Robert
[01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:35.880]  Maxwell. We already know about Kevin Spacey.
[01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:39.639]  All of a sudden, all these people show up dead who are going to be part of the
[01:08:39.639 --> 01:08:42.200]  Kevin Spacey trial.
[01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:43.760]  You know, give me a break.
[01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:45.480]  Wasn't it three in a row?
[01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:49.400]  Wasn't like three spacey accusers in a row met their demise.
[01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:54.000]  And of course, his show House of Cards, which was so glamorous, was when I was in
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:58.360]  D.C., it was all about glamorizing the corruption of Washington, D.C.
[01:08:58.639 --> 01:09:02.280]  So all these little kids would go there and think, oh, I'm going to be like House of
[01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:03.760]  Cards, Kevin Spacey.
[01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:08.360]  And, you know, screw over the American people on behalf of some congressmen.
[01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:13.480]  They were just trying to glamorize that to get ahead, get out ahead of it before all
[01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:16.040]  this stuff came out. But all this stuff is out now.
[01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:17.600]  OK, we know all this stuff.
[01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:21.920]  We know that Israel, the nation state of Israel, which Jeffrey Epstein was working
[01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:25.080]  for, according to Ari Ben-Manash, even confirmed by Rolling Stone.
[01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:29.960]  We know that Israel was working with Pfizer, had a covenant with Pfizer very, very
[01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:33.360]  early on in this process, even before then they admitted.
[01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:38.760]  We know that Ukraine, we know that Hunter Biden was an unofficial lobbyist for
[01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:42.520]  Medebiota, which was setting up all those Ukraine bio labs over there.
[01:09:42.639 --> 01:09:43.639]  Meanwhile, the U.S.
[01:09:43.639 --> 01:09:46.120]  Department of Defense, the Pentagon, the U.S.
[01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:48.360]  government was funding all these bio labs.
[01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:51.880]  I was the one who reported that all these people who want to say, oh, I'm out of the
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:53.280]  game. I'm such a crazy guy.
[01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:56.760]  Give me a break. I was the one who broke the Ukraine bio lab story.
[01:09:56.880 --> 01:09:58.360]  OK, come at me.
[01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:00.240]  Come at me. I'm right here.
[01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:01.600]  I'm not going anywhere.
[01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:02.920]  We're not going away.
[01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:08.280]  We know that the Obama Biden administration is linked now to the little house called
[01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:12.160]  Tucked Away in New Hampshire that Ghislaine Maxwell was hiding at.
[01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:17.920]  OK, when the FBI was looking for her, we all know that this is a big criminal scam.
[01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:19.360]  We all know about it.
[01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:20.960]  We all know about it.
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.559]  No, no, really, though, it is it is.
[01:10:23.559 --> 01:10:24.760]  We all know about it.
[01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:27.320]  I don't care. You can talk to the farthest left liberal.
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:30.040]  I mean, even a Biden voter knows Jeffrey didn't kill him.
[01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:31.600]  Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself.
[01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:35.480]  You talk to any far leftist, even they'll say, yeah, Epstein was a bad guy.
[01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:36.520]  He definitely didn't kill himself.
[01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:43.920]  So it's like where I mean, if anything is is centrist on an issue, you get a
[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:46.920]  bipartisan effort, but no effort.
[01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:48.720]  There's no hearings on Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:49.800]  There's nothing.
[01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:55.000]  No, of course not, because Kevin McCarthy is the Republican House leader and he's a
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.080]  globalist stooge.
[01:10:56.280 --> 01:11:01.040]  And all these Republicans that went for Kevin McCarthy are just being stooges for
[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:02.400]  this globalist scam.
[01:11:02.559 --> 01:11:04.800]  And thank God for Matt Gaetz and Lauren Boebert.
[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:08.600]  They fought it to the end, but they were some of the only ones Fox News went hard
[01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:12.280]  against. Then we know, obviously, Fox News is controlled opposition by their
[01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:14.840]  treatment of Tucker Carlson, the greatest host of all time.
[01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:18.000]  We know this. They want their war against Russia.
[01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:19.800]  They want their war with Ukraine.
[01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:24.280]  Lindsey Graham, all these neocons, all these Karl Rove people who still control the
[01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:26.160]  Republican Party and conservative media.
[01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:28.480]  They want their war against Russia.
[01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:30.639]  They take on Russia.
[01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:32.120]  They want the new world order.
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:33.639]  OK, that's what they want.
[01:11:33.639 --> 01:11:37.880]  They're on the same exact side as Biden and the globalist Democrats.
[01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:39.720]  They're on the same exact side.
[01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:41.360]  And we have to stop pretending they're not.
[01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:43.360]  There's no two party system in America.
[01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:45.720]  It's a uniparty in Washington, D.C.
[01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:48.120]  And we, the people, are suffering from inflation.
[01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:50.559]  We, the people, are suffering from open borders.
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:55.280]  We, the people, are seeing the child sex slavery that gets imported up over here, over
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:57.280]  the southern border. And we're sick of it.
[01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:01.920]  We are so sick of living in this strip mall labor colony in which we're just supposed to
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.200]  go spend our money at Walmart.
[01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:08.559]  And that's our that's our that's our whole thing as little economic units.
[01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:11.440]  Enough of this. I don't care about the GDP.
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:13.840]  I care about the moral fabric of this country.
[01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:18.720]  And the moral fabric of this country has been torn apart by the Ghislaine Maxwell,
[01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:23.120]  Jeffrey Epstein network and all the blackmail that has taken over the politics of the
[01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:24.320]  United States of America.
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:27.200]  Yeah, and they try to glorify this stuff, by the way.
[01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:30.960]  This is a syndicated story from Yahoo News.
[01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:35.600]  Masked neo-Nazis crash world's largest satanic event.
[01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:39.800]  We can now add fascist versus satanist to the list of iconic crossovers.
[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:40.760]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:42.480]  Nazis are socialists.
[01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:45.120]  Let me just let me do a little editorializing here, guys.
[01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:48.559]  If you got to get a doc cam here, I'm going to have to because your editor, Victor
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:51.360]  Sweezy, over at Yahoo News, your editor failed you here.
[01:12:51.559 --> 01:12:53.240]  Actually, Nazis are socialists.
[01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:56.000]  So I'm going to do a little I used to be an editor back in the day.
[01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:00.639]  Yeah, OK, so it's originally from the Daily Beast, that's what I'm saying, or Reuters
[01:13:00.639 --> 01:13:01.680]  even. I know it has Reuters on here.
[01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:03.520]  The point is, this is nationally syndicated story.
[01:13:03.639 --> 01:13:06.880]  It's like they're glorifying. It's like, oh, look, fascist and satanist.
[01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:08.680]  As you're talking about the moral fabric.
[01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:11.280]  But no, Nazis are actually socialists.
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.760]  I just want to make sure we correct the record there.
[01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:17.600]  They're actually socialists, but they don't want us to have that bad connotation of the
[01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:22.639]  word socialist because that's what they are now in the Democrat Party.
[01:13:22.639 --> 01:13:24.440]  Unfortunately, that's what we're dealing with.
[01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:30.240]  But yeah, the the issue of Jeffrey Epstein should be a bigger issue.
[01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:31.639]  None of the politicians will touch it.
[01:13:31.639 --> 01:13:33.720]  None of the media really wants to touch it either.
[01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:39.000]  And they would make the argument at the time, hey, hey, even even convicted pedophiles
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.280]  or even convicted sex traffickers should have a bank account.
[01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:45.639]  But but now they don't they don't want a basic Trump voter to have a bank account.
[01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:55.160]  Conan O'Brien hosted the Bohemian Grove variety show, Jack Black, the comedian admitted
[01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:57.880]  on The Tonight Show that he sold his soul to Satan.
[01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:01.520]  Hollywood is an arm of the deep state.
[01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:05.480]  Tiffany Fitzhenry, who's a great researcher, has proved that definitively that the
[01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:08.800]  Department of Defense has been behind a lot of these Hollywood productions.
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:14.120]  They have used the mockingbird media, including cable news, including Hollywood, to
[01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:19.040]  dupe you into the idea that there's some kind of stability, that the TV is the official
[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:20.760]  arbiter of what's true or not.
[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:21.840]  And it's not.
[01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:23.400]  The TV is a liar.
[01:14:23.559 --> 01:14:26.000]  The talking box in your house is a liar.
[01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:28.639]  Tucker Carlson was great, but he's canceled now.
[01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:29.960]  You see how it goes.
[01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:31.240]  You see how it goes.
[01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:33.520]  You can't be a truth teller on the TV box too long.
[01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:36.240]  And let's be honest, they can't have Tucker Carlson.
[01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:40.480]  You mentioned earlier they can't have Tucker Carlson on Fox News when they're getting
[01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:41.680]  ready to go to war against Russia.
[01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:46.600]  Because let's be honest, Fox News is used by the neocons to get conservatives to agree
[01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:50.240]  to war. Oh, it's literally Karl Rove's network.
[01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:54.160]  It's like Karl Rove producing the Merv Griffin show from the 70s.
[01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:56.000]  It's like you got Geraldo there.
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.720]  You got all these old stars, these fading stars.
[01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:02.960]  And meanwhile, it's all about the Karl Rove Dick Cheney agenda.
[01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:04.720]  That's always been Fox News.
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:09.840]  I was pretty surprised when Tucker became as big as he did on Fox News.
[01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:13.639]  But he just he he was so good that they just couldn't stop him.
[01:15:13.639 --> 01:15:17.720]  You know what I mean? But now eventually they've said, hey, enough of this.
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:19.559]  Shut it down. Shut it down.
[01:15:19.559 --> 01:15:21.000]  And they don't even care about the ratings.
[01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:22.360]  The ratings are tanking.
[01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:23.160]  They don't care.
[01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:24.880]  They just want to shut him up.
[01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:28.200]  It's all about a political agenda bigger than money for them.
[01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:33.720]  Well, right. And imagine if they say, well, we're going to lose X amount or they lost
[01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:36.920]  a billion dollars in their market cap after firing Tucker Carlson.
[01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:40.800]  I don't know where the number is now, but here's what they figure is, hey, hey, we're
[01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:43.960]  going to get that billion dollars made up by big pharmaceutical ad buys.
[01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:47.160]  And so it's definitely going to be worth it.
[01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:52.040]  And by the way, our friends, wink, wink, that have stocks and Lockheed Martin and
[01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:53.400]  Raytheon, they're going to do well, too.
[01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:55.559]  So we'll make up that billion dollars somehow.
[01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:05.600]  I want to say brain force is great.
[01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:07.440]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:12.680]  It is. But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:14.280]  The fish oil is better than that.
[01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:16.120]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:21.720]  Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:23.160]  Krill oils is the best.
[01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:24.520]  And it'll give you the damn burps.
[01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:26.440]  And I'm sorry. You want something like this?
[01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:27.400]  You don't get stuff for free.
[01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:29.320]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:30.520]  It's so good in my view.
[01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:32.600]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:35.520]  And I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[01:16:35.559 --> 01:16:37.280]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:43.720]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:49.720]  So we don't make a big profit off of it, but, you know, as I just obsess, because
[01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:52.360]  whatever the best is, we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:53.360]  I just can't do it.
[01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:02.280]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:08.120]  I want you all to know something.
[01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:09.960]  Alex Jones was right.
[01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:13.680]  Alex is right about far more than he's wrong.
[01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:16.680]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:19.520]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up.
[01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:20.760]  Rub it down.
[01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:22.760]  Alex Jones was right.
[01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:24.840]  Think about how frustrated we are.
[01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:28.800]  If you've been awake for a year or two, imagine being like an Alex Jones or those
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:30.440]  guys who've been awake for like decades.
[01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:34.240]  Alex Jones called this years ago, years ago.
[01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:36.480]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax.
[01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:37.480]  Not for a second.
[01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:40.960]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.440]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:46.600]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[01:17:46.639 --> 01:17:50.280]  That's why the globalists hate me, is because I'm exposing their corporate
[01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:51.400]  worldwide tyranny.
[01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:03.440]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move against
[01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:04.880]  Tucker Carlson and take him off the air.
[01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:07.280]  People said, no way he's the most powerful thing that ever happened.
[01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:09.600]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:12.240]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control
[01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:15.360]  him. But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[01:18:15.639 --> 01:18:20.400]  It's the same thing with InfoWars, but InfoWars is not owned by Fox or controlled
[01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:23.800]  by George Soros or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:26.960]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:29.600]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:34.400]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:37.760]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:40.480]  So I want to thank you for your support and encourage viewers and listeners to
[01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:43.680]  understand. Please don't take InfoWars for granted.
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.320]  We're barely hanging on.
[01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:48.120]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support.
[01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:51.040]  We're all getting great products at the same time at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:52.240]  So don't procrastinate.
[01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:56.400]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com, get amazing products that keep us on the air and never
[01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:58.080]  submit to these tyrants.
[01:18:58.639 --> 01:19:03.559]  Turbo Force is back, sold out for eight months and it's Turbo Force Plus.
[01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:05.360]  We made it even stronger.
[01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:09.559]  The strongest long term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[01:19:09.559 --> 01:19:13.680]  Turbo Force is back in stock at InfoWarsStore.com or
[01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:16.360]  888-253-3139.
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:21.400]  It's not just wide spectrum natural herbs that time
[01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:24.040]  release over 10 hours, should be called 10 hour energy.
[01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:28.840]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and
[01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:33.480]  amino acids that turbo charge everything and are good for your heart,
[01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:35.480]  your brain, your liver, you name it.
[01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:39.240]  It is the super fuel.
[01:19:39.639 --> 01:19:40.960]  RainForce Plus is great.
[01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:42.120]  RainForce Ultra is great.
[01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:43.000]  They're two different nootropics.
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:43.840]  They go good with this.
[01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:46.320]  But this is the King Kong.
[01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:48.080]  This is the boss.
[01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:50.800]  Turbo Force back in stock, discounted.
[01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:55.400]  InfoWarsStore.com, more power, more strength, more energy.
[01:19:58.040 --> 01:20:08.040]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:28.220]  Matt Taibbi, who is a Democrat, was the one working with Elon Musk to expose the Twitter
[01:20:28.220 --> 01:20:36.740]  files, and since he's been attacked from the left for doing so, and he's been very confused,
[01:20:36.740 --> 01:20:42.980]  people are noticing some of his recent interviews and reports, Matt Taibbi, America, the single
[01:20:42.980 --> 01:20:52.380]  opinion cult, in his recent piece, America, the single opinion cult, and this is what
[01:20:52.380 --> 01:20:58.740]  people are starting to learn, Patrick, is that it's really been a one-party system,
[01:20:58.740 --> 01:21:05.860]  a one-party culture that is really just leading them into what at the bottom line is a death
[01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:12.700]  cult, quite frankly, that's why they love the abortion so much, and all the other things
[01:21:12.700 --> 01:21:19.080]  like forcefully injecting you with a vaccine that you don't need, I could go on.
[01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:22.800]  I think the American people are seeing through this, and when the Democrats are going after
[01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:27.020]  their own on the anti-establishment side, like a Matt Taibbi or a Michael Schellenberger
[01:21:27.020 --> 01:21:33.020]  or now an RFK, what do you think the political consequences of this are going to be for the
[01:21:33.020 --> 01:21:34.020]  Democrat Party?
[01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:38.100]  Look, I've been waiting for a political realignment for a long time.
[01:21:38.100 --> 01:21:43.100]  Conservative media, including Ben Shapiro for a while, was shilling for the coronavirus
[01:21:43.100 --> 01:21:46.500]  injection, was shilling for the death jab, okay?
[01:21:46.500 --> 01:21:50.540]  We have to stop thinking about this in a right versus left paradigm.
[01:21:50.540 --> 01:21:53.940]  The right versus left paradigm is their mechanism of control.
[01:21:53.940 --> 01:21:58.500]  If that was real, do you really think they would put that on cable news and put Rachel
[01:21:58.500 --> 01:22:02.180]  Maddow against Sean Hannity and say, oh, this is what it is?
[01:22:02.180 --> 01:22:06.220]  Meanwhile, Tucker Carlson comes along and says, no, it's a little bit different than
[01:22:06.220 --> 01:22:07.220]  that.
[01:22:07.220 --> 01:22:10.460]  You have to understand that both of these sides are working together.
[01:22:10.460 --> 01:22:11.460]  And you know what?
[01:22:11.460 --> 01:22:15.380]  They kibosh them, and they send them away, and they think people aren't going to notice.
[01:22:15.380 --> 01:22:19.180]  And five years are going to go on, and then they'll just accept Brian Kilmeade or whoever
[01:22:19.180 --> 01:22:20.180]  at APL.
[01:22:20.180 --> 01:22:25.140]  I don't think Fox News will be that, I mean, you know, I don't know, after you fire Tucker
[01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:31.140]  Carlson, maybe you are suicidal, but I mean, Kilmeade, come on.
[01:22:31.140 --> 01:22:32.140]  It's ridiculous.
[01:22:32.140 --> 01:22:37.740]  Look, Iraq, the Fox News channel was the biggest cheerleader of the Iraq war.
[01:22:37.740 --> 01:22:39.340]  I remember it well.
[01:22:39.340 --> 01:22:43.860]  You know, all these people want to say the millennial generation is so lazy, so awful.
[01:22:43.860 --> 01:22:48.260]  Well, it was a lot of my friends who went over there and fought that war, thinking that
[01:22:48.260 --> 01:22:51.740]  they were doing something good, thinking they were doing something patriotic.
[01:22:51.740 --> 01:22:55.820]  And no disrespect to any of the people who are watching who fought that war, but I totally
[01:22:55.820 --> 01:22:56.900]  disagree with that war.
[01:22:56.900 --> 01:23:01.860]  I totally disagree with what they did, how they presented it, how Sean Hannity, Karl
[01:23:01.860 --> 01:23:04.380]  Rove, and those people represented it.
[01:23:04.380 --> 01:23:07.980]  This is, I mean, we are a strip mall labor colony.
[01:23:07.980 --> 01:23:13.580]  We're Walmart after Arby's, okay, after Denny's, I mean, you have illegal immigrants throwing
[01:23:13.580 --> 01:23:18.580]  their Denny's Grand Slam wrappers out the side of the car on the side of the interstate.
[01:23:18.580 --> 01:23:25.300]  I mean, there's beautiful land in this country, but it's been paved over for Walmart, Denny's,
[01:23:25.300 --> 01:23:30.060]  Walgreens, Target, I mean, Taco Bell, I mean, give me a break.
[01:23:30.060 --> 01:23:32.620]  I mean, this is all just a big highway country now.
[01:23:32.620 --> 01:23:34.020]  We're so sick of it.
[01:23:34.020 --> 01:23:38.100]  We're so sick of being a strip mall labor colony of the globalists, and they think they
[01:23:38.100 --> 01:23:44.500]  can just mandate a vaccine and get you to inject the mark of the beast 666 poison into
[01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:45.900]  their veins.
[01:23:45.900 --> 01:23:49.740]  You know, I'll admit something to you, Owen, right here, which breaks my heart, which is
[01:23:49.740 --> 01:23:54.180]  that I couldn't save my sister from taking that god awful needle, and it hurts me to
[01:23:54.180 --> 01:23:56.380]  this very, very day.
[01:23:56.380 --> 01:23:57.420]  And you know what?
[01:23:57.420 --> 01:24:01.500]  If I could go back in time, I would have fought, I would have, I would have sat by her side
[01:24:01.500 --> 01:24:03.940]  and just counseled her every single day.
[01:24:03.940 --> 01:24:04.940]  Please don't take this.
[01:24:04.940 --> 01:24:05.940]  Please don't take this.
[01:24:05.940 --> 01:24:06.940]  But you know what?
[01:24:06.940 --> 01:24:09.440]  The propaganda proved more powerful than me at that time.
[01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:11.380]  And that's what drives me right now.
[01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:12.380]  That's what drives me.
[01:24:12.380 --> 01:24:13.380]  I'm bringing the camp.
[01:24:13.380 --> 01:24:16.140]  I'm bringing the campaign show back in a week, by the way, I'm banned out video.
[01:24:16.140 --> 01:24:21.260]  I'm going to bring it to these people like they have never had it brought to them before.
[01:24:21.260 --> 01:24:22.640]  And you know, I can do it.
[01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:23.640]  You know, I can do it.
[01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:24.640]  Well, you know, did you see the documents?
[01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:27.560]  All I'm motivated by is schadenfreude.
[01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:29.680]  I'm motivated by schadenfreude.
[01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:34.600]  I'm motivated by their lives should be worse for what they've done to us.
[01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:35.600]  Yeah.
[01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:36.920]  Carrie Lake called for Pfizer.
[01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:39.640]  Carrie Lake called for Fauci to be in jail for life today.
[01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:40.640]  That's the right.
[01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:41.640]  That's the right messaging.
[01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:44.000]  And I don't even know if she saw the new documents that got released.
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:45.720]  We just published them at Infowars.com.
[01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:51.280]  The new documents, the FDA and Pfizer knew the vaccines were extremely high risk for pregnant
[01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:54.640]  women and they gave them to them and they promoted them anyway.
[01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:57.120]  Oh, sure, that's the point.
[01:24:57.120 --> 01:24:59.160]  They're genociding us.
[01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:01.120]  We're farm animals in their eyes.
[01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:02.120]  We're cattle.
[01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:03.720]  They're genociding us.
[01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:07.380]  And by the way, they're putting the MRNA injection in the food supply.
[01:25:07.380 --> 01:25:14.600]  So one way or another, Bill Gates, that demon is determined to get it into all of us.
[01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:16.200]  He's determined to do that.
[01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:22.200]  I mean, his little apparatchik Fauci, his little golem Fauci, his little troll Fauci.
[01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:24.480]  I mean, enough is enough of this.
[01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:26.920]  Enough is enough of the lies of the mainstream media.
[01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:28.400]  No, no, no, no.
[01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:29.400]  Fauci, he didn't.
[01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:30.400]  He did an interview this week.
[01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:31.920]  He said he never called for lockdown.
[01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:32.920]  So not me.
[01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:34.880]  I never called for the lockdown.
[01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:36.840]  It's kind of like like Trudeau.
[01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:37.840]  Trudeau comes out.
[01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:42.960]  He's like, oh, I never said the vaccines were mandatory.
[01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:44.960]  I never said any of that.
[01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:46.320]  He's like, wait a second.
[01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:48.080]  What's with the change of spirit here?
[01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:50.480]  You guys were all gung ho.
[01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:52.720]  You were gung ho about the lockdowns.
[01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:54.620]  You were gung ho about the vaccines.
[01:25:54.620 --> 01:25:55.620]  You couldn't.
[01:25:55.620 --> 01:25:56.620]  You guys were the cheerleaders.
[01:25:56.620 --> 01:25:59.120]  But now you're like, oh, no, not us.
[01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:02.400]  It wasn't us.
[01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:04.720]  Everything they say is a lie.
[01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:05.720]  That's not mine.
[01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:10.240]  No, I was the one who broke the story about the Higgins report, by the way.
[01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:15.720]  The Las Vegas shooting, a former top Trump adviser named Rich Higgins, who's now dead,
[01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:21.040]  got a report saying the Las Vegas shooting, all these connections to ISIS and Antifa,
[01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:24.640]  all this reporting that he got, nobody in the mainstream media would touch it.
[01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:30.800]  You know who the only outlet was in 2020 who I could go on and I could say, you don't want
[01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:32.440]  to take this bioweapon.
[01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:34.120]  You don't want to take this genocide needle.
[01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:35.880]  It was Alex Jones.
[01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:36.880]  What has happened?
[01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:40.040]  Alex Jones has been demonized in the mainstream media.
[01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:42.960]  Oh, don't be like Alex Jones, normies.
[01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:48.360]  They are desperate to try to control the information so that the real information doesn't get in
[01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:50.800]  the minds of critical thinking people.
[01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:54.000]  Once the real information gets in the minds of the critical thinking people, their thing
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:55.000]  is done.
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:56.640]  Their fiat currency is done.
[01:26:56.640 --> 01:26:58.360]  Their war machine is done.
[01:26:58.360 --> 01:27:00.440]  All their media propaganda is done.
[01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:02.600]  This is an information war.
[01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:05.480]  It's an electronic war, as Andrew Breitbart said.
[01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:06.760]  That's what it's all about.
[01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:08.680]  That's why this censorship is happening.
[01:27:08.680 --> 01:27:12.200]  It's all about the freedom of people's minds.
[01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:14.920]  By the way, this is free people's minds right now.
[01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:18.920]  This is what I think, because you're since you're bringing this up, this is what I when
[01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:24.360]  I watch Space Odyssey and when you think about the obelisk, that's what it represents.
[01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:27.620]  Why do why do the monkeys go to the obelisk?
[01:27:27.620 --> 01:27:29.860]  Why does that cause evolution?
[01:27:29.860 --> 01:27:34.680]  Because it makes them think it makes them think they see something that's there that
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:35.840]  wasn't there before.
[01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:36.960]  That's like Alex Jones.
[01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:37.960]  That's like Tucker Carlson.
[01:27:37.960 --> 01:27:39.520]  We're the obelisk.
[01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:42.840]  And when the people, when the normies, as you say, when they see the obelisk and they
[01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:48.320]  touch the obelisk and they start, oh, the whole world changes.
[01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:49.580]  Correct.
[01:27:49.580 --> 01:27:51.080]  And it's all about child trafficking.
[01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:59.240]  Oh, and you know that Kamala Harris was, you know, called into the state to represent the
[01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:06.440]  opposition against a mother named Tammy Reif on her son, Jonah Reif, who is allegedly and
[01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:10.280]  very credibly, according to the evidence, put into child sex trafficking.
[01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:12.480]  Why did they have to take Kamala into that?
[01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:17.500]  Why was Nancy Pelosi personally renting office space to first five San Mateo, which was run
[01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:23.440]  by a convicted pedophile, a convicted pedophile who died in prison?
[01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:25.800]  Then there's then there's the Ed Buck connection.
[01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:29.120]  There's the open border that the Homeland Security is telling people.
[01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:32.080]  It's a giant sex trafficking operation and testimony.
[01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:33.080]  Amazing stuff.
[01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:34.080]  Thank you so much, Holly.
[01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:37.520]  Your channel on Bandai video is on fire as well as are you.
[01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:39.400]  We thank you for joining us this Sunday night.

[01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:05.480]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to Infowarsstore.com
[01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:09.280]  and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune system
[01:30:09.280 --> 01:30:11.320]  in your body and keep us on air.
[01:30:11.320 --> 01:30:16.640]  I am humbly, hand in hand, talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in, many of
[01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:19.920]  you for years, and never gone to Infowarsstore.com.
[01:30:19.920 --> 01:30:25.440]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you never actually go to Infowarsstore.com
[01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:28.400]  and never experienced these great products and never found the operation.
[01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:32.160]  Sure, you share a link, you share an article, you tell folks about the show, that's great
[01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:33.160]  and I thank you.
[01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:37.240]  But we need funds to operate, plus we've got really great products that do amazing things
[01:30:37.240 --> 01:30:41.280]  for people like our CBD oil, and our Fizzy Magnesium, and our Sleep Aid, and our Nitric
[01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:45.320]  Oxide, and our Real Red Pill, plus all of these are really great products that keep
[01:30:45.320 --> 01:30:47.760]  us on air, plus you're missing out on having these products.
[01:30:47.760 --> 01:30:53.040]  So get off the bench, get in the game, step to the plate and go to Infowarsstore.com right
[01:30:53.040 --> 01:30:56.680]  now and get these great Infowars products at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:03.400]  I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had.
[01:31:03.400 --> 01:31:05.400]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[01:31:05.400 --> 01:31:09.400]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[01:31:09.400 --> 01:31:14.400]  When we talk about the crew at Infowars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:18.400]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:22.400]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every
[01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:26.400]  day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:30.400]  So for myself and the whole Infowars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:36.400]  I only encourage you now to realize that Infowars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:37.400]  I know you spread the word.
[01:31:37.400 --> 01:31:38.400]  I know you pray for us.
[01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:39.400]  And that's wonderful.
[01:31:39.400 --> 01:31:40.400]  Keep doing it.
[01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:44.400]  But most viewers and listeners never go to Infowarsstore.com, and you never buy great
[01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:48.400]  products that enrich and empower your life while at the same time keeping us on air.
[01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:52.400]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:31:52.400 --> 01:31:56.400]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to Infowarsstore.com, our funding problems
[01:31:56.400 --> 01:31:57.400]  will be over.
[01:31:57.400 --> 01:31:58.400]  Please take action now.
[01:31:59.400 --> 01:32:02.400]  I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had.

[01:32:04.400 --> 01:32:08.400]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.

[01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:22.400]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day,
[01:32:22.400 --> 01:32:24.400]  five, six, seven days a week.
[01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:26.400]  It's really just incredible.
[01:32:26.400 --> 01:32:30.400]  So for myself and the whole Infowars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:36.400]  I only encourage you now to realize that Infowars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.

[01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:06.400]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:08.190 --> 01:33:25.990]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show, and now
[01:33:25.990 --> 01:33:29.589]  your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:33:30.589 --> 01:33:40.589]  Yes, that's right, and now your calls on this Sunday evening edition of The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:40.589 --> 01:33:52.589]  The tip of the spear against the corrupt corporate press and the New World Order death cult establishment.
[01:33:52.589 --> 01:33:55.589]  Biggest grassroots for the people news organization on the planet.
[01:33:55.589 --> 01:33:58.589]  Naturally, that's why they have to snuff us out.
[01:33:58.589 --> 01:34:02.589]  We're still here thanks to your support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:34:02.589 --> 01:34:08.589]  Man, oh man, continuing to get messaged about TurboForce Plus being back in stock.
[01:34:08.589 --> 01:34:10.589]  People glad it's finally arriving.
[01:34:10.589 --> 01:34:13.589]  Their orders finally arriving at their house.
[01:34:13.589 --> 01:34:20.589]  And then some people who listen to the show but don't shop at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:34:20.589 --> 01:34:21.589]  We'll see.
[01:34:21.589 --> 01:34:23.589]  I'm about to take a bunch of calls.
[01:34:23.589 --> 01:34:26.589]  People always call in, and they bring up, a lot of the times, their favorite supplements
[01:34:26.589 --> 01:34:29.589]  at InfoWarsStore.com because they enjoy them so much.
[01:34:29.589 --> 01:34:32.589]  They want to share that with the audience.
[01:34:32.589 --> 01:34:35.589]  And it's been TurboForce that people are talking about.
[01:34:35.589 --> 01:34:40.589]  And I'll have people message me like, hey, I keep hearing about this TurboForce on your show.
[01:34:40.589 --> 01:34:42.589]  Is it really that great?
[01:34:42.589 --> 01:34:46.589]  Let me tell you, there's a reason why energy drinks are popular.
[01:34:46.589 --> 01:34:47.589]  There's no denying that.
[01:34:47.589 --> 01:34:52.589]  You walk into a grocery store, gas station, refrigerators full of energy drinks.
[01:34:52.589 --> 01:34:55.589]  Most of those, if not all, are toxic in some way, shape, or form.
[01:34:55.589 --> 01:34:57.589]  Not TurboForce Plus.
[01:34:57.589 --> 01:34:58.589]  It's the real deal.
[01:34:58.589 --> 01:35:04.589]  Ten hours of clean energy, not unhealthy, with all the processed sugar.
[01:35:04.589 --> 01:35:07.589]  I mean, just spoonfuls of it.
[01:35:07.589 --> 01:35:10.589]  Processed sugar, high fructose corn syrup, you name it.
[01:35:10.589 --> 01:35:14.589]  The acidic battery taste, none of that TurboForce Plus.
[01:35:14.589 --> 01:35:20.589]  Ten hours of clean energy in a canister now, a powder in a canister.
[01:35:20.589 --> 01:35:22.589]  It used to be in a little sleeve, a little packet.
[01:35:22.589 --> 01:35:23.589]  We put it in the canister now.
[01:35:23.589 --> 01:35:27.589]  So you get more bang for your buck at InfowarsStore.com,
[01:35:27.589 --> 01:35:29.589]  and it's your support there that keeps us on the air.
[01:35:29.589 --> 01:35:33.589]  But yes, for those asking, is TurboForce Plus really that great?
[01:35:33.589 --> 01:35:36.589]  Yes, yes, and yes.
[01:35:36.589 --> 01:35:38.589]  All right.
[01:35:38.589 --> 01:35:42.589]  To the phone lines we go.
[01:35:42.589 --> 01:35:46.589]  Let's go to John in New Hampshire to lead us off tonight.
[01:35:46.589 --> 01:35:47.589]  John, you're on the air.
[01:35:47.589 --> 01:35:48.589]  Go ahead.
[01:35:48.589 --> 01:35:49.589]  Hi, Owen.
[01:35:49.589 --> 01:35:50.589]  How are you?
[01:35:50.589 --> 01:35:51.589]  Howdy, John.
[01:35:51.589 --> 01:35:52.589]  I'm all right.
[01:35:52.589 --> 01:35:55.589]  I'm the first one you said, be quick with your dial.
[01:35:55.589 --> 01:35:56.589]  I ended up being the first one.
[01:35:56.589 --> 01:35:58.589]  That's actually kind of funny.
[01:35:58.589 --> 01:36:01.589]  You've got the fastest fingers in the West today.
[01:36:01.589 --> 01:36:04.589]  Yeah, real quick.
[01:36:04.589 --> 01:36:07.589]  So we got here where I live, the next town over,
[01:36:07.589 --> 01:36:11.589]  we got every Friday out on the Common and the town center,
[01:36:11.589 --> 01:36:13.589]  we get a group of communists that stand up.
[01:36:13.589 --> 01:36:16.589]  And this is a bunch of your old, your classical old liberal,
[01:36:16.589 --> 01:36:19.589]  the 50s, 60s, probably.
[01:36:19.589 --> 01:36:21.589]  So just like, you know, pot smoking hippies?
[01:36:21.589 --> 01:36:23.589]  Yeah, basically, basically.
[01:36:23.589 --> 01:36:26.589]  And they're all standing there around the Common holding their BLM signs,
[01:36:26.589 --> 01:36:29.589]  pushing the communism crap out every day.
[01:36:29.589 --> 01:36:36.589]  And it's sickening to me to see how every week their support is growing.
[01:36:36.589 --> 01:36:38.589]  I don't understand where these people are coming from.
[01:36:38.589 --> 01:36:41.589]  They must have some good stuff, you know?
[01:36:41.589 --> 01:36:47.589]  Whoever I talk to, whenever I interact, there's no, they don't think the same way.
[01:36:47.589 --> 01:36:51.589]  But then all of a sudden I see it's almost like they double every weekend.
[01:36:51.589 --> 01:36:52.589]  It's weird.
[01:36:52.589 --> 01:36:54.589]  They're coming out of the woodwork now for some reason.
[01:36:54.589 --> 01:36:55.589]  New Hampshire.
[01:36:55.589 --> 01:36:58.589]  So there's just commies just gathering in New Hampshire now.
[01:36:58.589 --> 01:37:01.589]  Well, I think they're coming from Vermont is where I believe they're coming from.
[01:37:01.589 --> 01:37:04.589]  Well, Bernie sent them.
[01:37:04.589 --> 01:37:09.589]  They stand right in the middle of Claremont and they push their commie crap.
[01:37:09.589 --> 01:37:11.589]  They've actually bled into the local school board and whatnot.
[01:37:11.589 --> 01:37:13.589]  And it's ridiculous.
[01:37:13.589 --> 01:37:16.589]  I have a really good friend, my former roommate, actually.
[01:37:16.589 --> 01:37:21.589]  He had a girl he met online, whatever, hit it off.
[01:37:21.589 --> 01:37:23.589]  She moved up here with her kid.
[01:37:23.589 --> 01:37:26.589]  Kid was a perfect little girl, 12 year old little girl.
[01:37:26.589 --> 01:37:29.589]  Started in the end of the Claremont school system.
[01:37:29.589 --> 01:37:31.589]  Within six weeks, she comes home.
[01:37:31.589 --> 01:37:32.589]  She's got her head shaved.
[01:37:32.589 --> 01:37:37.589]  She's now, she's now no longer a little boy.
[01:37:37.589 --> 01:37:39.589]  Teachers pushing this stuff on her.
[01:37:39.589 --> 01:37:42.589]  And they've got like the gay club.
[01:37:42.589 --> 01:37:43.589]  They've got started.
[01:37:43.589 --> 01:37:44.589]  It's a secret little gay club.
[01:37:44.589 --> 01:37:49.589]  They've got the Claremont middle school and high school where the teachers get together
[01:37:49.589 --> 01:37:53.589]  and they talk amongst each student about what students are bad, what students are good.
[01:37:53.589 --> 01:37:55.589]  They pick on the students and stuff.
[01:37:55.589 --> 01:37:57.589]  It's pretty sickening what they're doing.
[01:37:57.589 --> 01:37:58.589]  No, no, no.
[01:37:58.589 --> 01:37:59.589]  This is disgusting.
[01:37:59.589 --> 01:38:04.589]  It used to be like after school clubs or like science or engineering and stuff like that.
[01:38:04.589 --> 01:38:08.589]  Now it's like, oh, the after school LGBTQ plus Satan club.
[01:38:08.589 --> 01:38:11.589]  And it's not even after school though.
[01:38:11.589 --> 01:38:13.589]  It's going on like during school hours.
[01:38:13.589 --> 01:38:18.589]  So instead of teaching math, they've got their little LGBT group meeting in the corner.
[01:38:18.589 --> 01:38:21.589]  And the kids don't know any better.
[01:38:21.589 --> 01:38:24.589]  And they just go along with it because they think, oh, I'm getting out of school.
[01:38:24.589 --> 01:38:27.589]  You know, it's like you have a school event and you get out of class or something.
[01:38:27.589 --> 01:38:28.589]  You're a kid.
[01:38:28.589 --> 01:38:29.589]  It's like, yeah, I'm out of class.
[01:38:29.589 --> 01:38:30.589]  So they're just like, oh, the gay stuff.
[01:38:30.589 --> 01:38:31.589]  Yeah, I'm out of class.
[01:38:31.589 --> 01:38:32.589]  They don't even get it.
[01:38:32.589 --> 01:38:34.589]  Oh, boy, that is just awful to hear, John.
[01:38:34.589 --> 01:38:35.589]  Thank you for the call.
[01:38:35.589 --> 01:38:38.589]  Let's go to Bill here in Austin, Texas.
[01:38:38.589 --> 01:38:39.589]  Bill, you're on the air.
[01:38:39.589 --> 01:38:41.589]  Go ahead.
[01:38:41.589 --> 01:38:49.589]  Hey, so I just wanted to call and say it was neat to see Ali Alexander come back on Twitter.
[01:38:49.589 --> 01:38:52.589]  You know, he had such a cool handle on Twitter, A-L-I.
[01:38:52.589 --> 01:39:02.589]  And then it was neat to see him come back from J6, that whole thing, and come back to InfoWars,
[01:39:02.589 --> 01:39:07.589]  bringing, of all people, Kanye West and Nick Fuentes and Milo Yiannopoulos.
[01:39:08.589 --> 01:39:16.589]  And it was just so cool to see how close Ali is with Alex, and then to get all of the information
[01:39:16.589 --> 01:39:26.589]  about Ali grooming young men and soliciting dick pics from them and this being a well-widely
[01:39:26.589 --> 01:39:34.589]  known thing among his circle, you know, it's really cool to see how the people that you
[01:39:34.589 --> 01:39:40.589]  lie down with, the people that you make business with, are all around you and they're the same
[01:39:40.589 --> 01:39:42.589]  as you.
[01:39:42.589 --> 01:39:47.589]  And Ali Alexander and Alex Jones probably, you know, cut from the same cloth.
[01:39:47.589 --> 01:39:50.589]  It's just really neat to see all that happen.
[01:39:50.589 --> 01:39:54.589]  And I wanted to say, Owen, honk, honk.
[01:39:54.589 --> 01:39:58.589]  So, I don't really understand the point of your call.
[01:39:58.589 --> 01:39:59.589]  I can sense the sarcasm.
[01:39:59.589 --> 01:40:01.589]  I mean, is there something you want to say?
[01:40:01.589 --> 01:40:03.589]  Or are you just going to kind of come on here?
[01:40:03.589 --> 01:40:04.589]  Are you trying to gaslight me?
[01:40:04.589 --> 01:40:05.589]  I don't get it.
[01:40:05.589 --> 01:40:07.589]  No, I want you to talk about Ali Alexander.
[01:40:07.589 --> 01:40:08.589]  Why?
[01:40:08.589 --> 01:40:09.589]  Why?
[01:40:09.589 --> 01:40:14.589]  Because Milo drops all of this loathe about Ali being a predator.
[01:40:14.589 --> 01:40:18.589]  Okay, so that's good for Milo.
[01:40:18.589 --> 01:40:20.589]  Hey, that's fine, Bill.
[01:40:20.589 --> 01:40:22.589]  And look, I don't mind you calling in and talking about this.
[01:40:22.589 --> 01:40:26.589]  The problem is I'm not going to waste the audience's time on this subject material.
[01:40:26.589 --> 01:40:27.589]  You understand?
[01:40:27.589 --> 01:40:32.589]  And so you can call in and talk about it, but let me just put it to rest like this.
[01:40:32.589 --> 01:40:38.589]  Folks, you notice, I mean, I'm not going to speak for Alex, but you can tell what InfoWars does.
[01:40:38.589 --> 01:40:39.589]  But I'll speak for myself.
[01:40:39.589 --> 01:40:44.589]  We don't go into these rumor drama cycles with the rest of the media.
[01:40:44.589 --> 01:40:45.589]  Okay?
[01:40:45.589 --> 01:40:47.589]  We don't do it.
[01:40:47.589 --> 01:40:51.589]  And we like to stay above that because there's real issues.
[01:40:51.589 --> 01:40:53.589]  So this guy is a perfect example.
[01:40:53.589 --> 01:40:57.589]  He wants me to talk about Ali Alexander.
[01:40:57.589 --> 01:41:00.589]  The audience doesn't want me to talk about Ali Alexander.
[01:41:00.589 --> 01:41:02.589]  They want to talk about the New World Order.
[01:41:02.589 --> 01:41:03.589]  They want to know about how we're going to stop this.
[01:41:03.589 --> 01:41:06.589]  They want to talk about is Trump going to be the next guy or should we go with somebody else?
[01:41:06.589 --> 01:41:14.589]  You want me to go into the depths of the Internet rumor drama world like I'm a high school student.
[01:41:14.589 --> 01:41:15.589]  I'm not.
[01:41:15.589 --> 01:41:16.589]  I'm an adult.
[01:41:16.589 --> 01:41:17.589]  Okay?
[01:41:17.589 --> 01:41:24.589]  Now, if I want to do a response to all the other rumor mill crap that I get brought into, then I can do an hour-long video every day,
[01:41:24.589 --> 01:41:28.589]  and I could divulge into that stuff, and I could lower my own standards, but it's not going to happen.
[01:41:28.589 --> 01:41:33.589]  So let's take another call here, and let's go to Andy in Florida.
[01:41:33.589 --> 01:41:34.589]  Andy, you're on the air.
[01:41:34.589 --> 01:41:35.589]  Go ahead.
[01:41:35.589 --> 01:41:37.589]  Oh, and wow.
[01:41:37.589 --> 01:41:38.589]  Cool.
[01:41:38.589 --> 01:41:40.589]  Hey, what a loser, that last caller.
[01:41:40.589 --> 01:41:41.589]  He was just trying to bait you.
[01:41:41.589 --> 01:41:46.589]  Hey, my question, sir, how are we going to win the election no matter who we choose?
[01:41:46.589 --> 01:41:50.589]  And I think I prefer Trump at this point, but DeSantis, you know, he's okay.
[01:41:50.589 --> 01:41:56.589]  I don't know if I trust him 100 percent, but seeing how they stuffed the ballot boxes in all those urban centers, you're a bright guy.
[01:41:56.589 --> 01:41:59.589]  What are we going to do to win the election?
[01:41:59.589 --> 01:42:01.589]  Because if we don't win, then it's lost.
[01:42:01.589 --> 01:42:03.589]  All is lost at this point, I believe.
[01:42:03.589 --> 01:42:08.589]  Well, I'm really short on time here, so I'll try to wrap this up before the break.
[01:42:08.589 --> 01:42:13.589]  But I've discussed this before, how right now there really is no path to victory for any Republican candidate
[01:42:13.589 --> 01:42:24.589]  because of what the Democrats do in Phoenix and in Atlanta and in Detroit and in Philadelphia and in Milwaukee.
[01:42:24.589 --> 01:42:30.589]  And until you address those issues or do something to counter those issues, you're never going to win Arizona.
[01:42:30.589 --> 01:42:31.589]  You're never going to win Georgia.
[01:42:31.589 --> 01:42:33.589]  You're never going to win Pennsylvania.
[01:42:33.589 --> 01:42:36.589]  You're never going to win Michigan, and you're never going to win Wisconsin.
[01:42:36.589 --> 01:42:40.589]  And if you can't win those five states, I see no path to victory for the Republican Party.
[01:42:40.589 --> 01:42:42.589]  So the answer is they're not going to win the election.
[01:42:42.589 --> 01:42:47.589]  But the more people get involved and the more people watch and notice what's really going on,
[01:42:47.589 --> 01:42:52.589]  how there's no chance Biden beat Trump in 2020 or whatever is going to happen in 2024,
[01:42:52.589 --> 01:42:56.589]  the more The Awakening is going to have people asking questions and trying to fix it.
[01:42:58.589 --> 01:43:04.589]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson and take him off the air.
[01:43:04.589 --> 01:43:07.589]  People said, no way, he's the most powerful thing that ever happened.
[01:43:07.589 --> 01:43:09.589]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[01:43:09.589 --> 01:43:12.589]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him.
[01:43:12.589 --> 01:43:15.589]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[01:43:15.589 --> 01:43:17.589]  It's the same thing with Infowars.
[01:43:17.589 --> 01:43:23.589]  But Infowars is not owned by Fox or controlled by George Soros or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[01:43:23.589 --> 01:43:26.589]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[01:43:26.589 --> 01:43:29.589]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[01:43:29.589 --> 01:43:34.589]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[01:43:34.589 --> 01:43:37.589]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[01:43:37.589 --> 01:43:40.589]  So I want to thank you for your support and encourage viewers and listeners to understand,
[01:43:40.589 --> 01:43:43.589]  please don't take Infowars for granted.
[01:43:43.589 --> 01:43:45.589]  We're barely hanging on.
[01:43:45.589 --> 01:43:48.589]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support,

[01:44:03.589 --> 01:44:06.589]  All the success that we've had together against the globalists,
[01:44:06.589 --> 01:44:11.589]  the fact that we're not caught flat-footed during their major takeover is because of you.
[01:44:11.589 --> 01:44:14.589]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.

[01:44:58.589 --> 01:45:02.589]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[01:45:06.589 --> 01:45:09.589]  I want you all to know something. Alex Jones was right.
[01:45:09.589 --> 01:45:13.589]  Alex is right about far more than is wrong.
[01:45:13.589 --> 01:45:16.589]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[01:45:16.589 --> 01:45:22.589]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up, or rub it down, Alex Jones was right.
[01:45:22.589 --> 01:45:26.589]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[01:45:26.589 --> 01:45:30.589]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for, like, decades.
[01:45:30.589 --> 01:45:33.589]  Alex Jones called this years ago, years ago.
[01:45:33.589 --> 01:45:37.589]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[01:45:38.589 --> 01:45:40.589]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[01:45:40.589 --> 01:45:43.589]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[01:45:43.589 --> 01:45:46.589]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[01:45:46.589 --> 01:45:51.589]  That's why the globalists hate me is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[01:45:58.589 --> 01:46:05.589]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into the atmosphere.
[01:46:05.589 --> 01:46:08.589]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[01:46:08.589 --> 01:46:16.589]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers to convert these gases into fluorosilicic acid.
[01:46:16.589 --> 01:46:19.589]  Still highly toxic, but containable.
[01:46:19.589 --> 01:46:25.589]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison, and there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[01:46:25.589 --> 01:46:30.589]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the Secretary of the Treasury,
[01:46:30.589 --> 01:46:33.589]  who was responsible for the public health service at the time.
[01:46:33.589 --> 01:46:40.589]  And by 1950, the U.S. government began buying this toxic, untreated, industrial waste product,
[01:46:40.589 --> 01:46:42.589]  and dumping it into our drinking water.
[01:46:42.589 --> 01:46:47.589]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[01:46:47.589 --> 01:46:53.589]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water, and a remedy to this madness.
[01:46:53.589 --> 01:46:57.589]  Available now at infowarestore.com.
[01:46:57.589 --> 01:47:05.589]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:07.430 --> 01:47:23.990]  Alright, closing out this evening is Alex Jones' show with your phone calls.
[01:47:23.990 --> 01:47:28.830]  And we now go to Michael in Texas, wants to talk about RFK Jr.
[01:47:28.830 --> 01:47:30.910]  Michael, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:47:30.910 --> 01:47:35.590]  Hey Owen, good Sunday afternoon to you brother, how are you?
[01:47:35.590 --> 01:47:36.590]  Thank you, great.
[01:47:36.590 --> 01:47:45.190]  Yeah, so, RFK is like, he just came out of nowhere and, you know, announcing his presidency
[01:47:45.190 --> 01:47:49.430]  and coming out, exposing everything.
[01:47:49.430 --> 01:47:53.190]  I don't even think he's going to make it into the primaries, you know, he's going to...
[01:47:53.190 --> 01:47:54.190]  Oh, of course not.
[01:47:54.190 --> 01:47:55.190]  Yeah, the Democrats are going to rig this thing.
[01:47:55.190 --> 01:47:56.190]  And it's great.
[01:47:56.190 --> 01:47:58.150]  I'm excited to watch him rig it against RFK.
[01:47:58.150 --> 01:47:59.150]  I mean, it's bad for the country.
[01:47:59.150 --> 01:48:00.150]  He's a great candidate.
[01:48:00.150 --> 01:48:01.150]  I even like him.
[01:48:01.150 --> 01:48:03.070]  Wouldn't mind him to be president.
[01:48:03.070 --> 01:48:06.550]  But yeah, they're going to rig it and we'll all watch it and it'll be great to see.
[01:48:07.110 --> 01:48:09.630]  Yeah, but, you know, how does that help us?
[01:48:09.630 --> 01:48:10.630]  I mean...
[01:48:10.630 --> 01:48:15.430]  Because, Michael, because, Michael, most Americans still don't get it.
[01:48:15.430 --> 01:48:16.990]  They still don't get it.
[01:48:16.990 --> 01:48:18.990]  And so they're going to have to see it to get it.
[01:48:18.990 --> 01:48:21.630]  And you're going to have a lot of Democrats that like RFK Jr. and they're going to get
[01:48:21.630 --> 01:48:22.630]  behind him.
[01:48:22.630 --> 01:48:24.130]  And he's going to grow in the poll numbers.
[01:48:24.130 --> 01:48:25.670]  And everybody knows Biden's not popular.
[01:48:25.670 --> 01:48:27.550]  And then they're going to steal it from RFK.
[01:48:27.550 --> 01:48:31.070]  And then those Democrats are going to finally say, OK, you know what?
[01:48:31.070 --> 01:48:32.390]  We're sick of the rigged system.
[01:48:32.390 --> 01:48:35.110]  We want to talk about it and do something now.
[01:48:35.110 --> 01:48:39.430]  I don't think they're going to get it until they're standing behind the fences in their
[01:48:39.430 --> 01:48:40.430]  FEMA camps.
[01:48:40.430 --> 01:48:44.270]  And, you know, by then, it's, of course, going to be too late.
[01:48:44.270 --> 01:48:45.990]  Yeah, it's scary.
[01:48:45.990 --> 01:48:51.950]  I mean, Trump, I don't I mean, love Trump, but, you know, taking money from Big Pharma
[01:48:51.950 --> 01:48:58.990]  as well and still, you know, supporting, you know, his warp speed is just I don't know
[01:48:58.990 --> 01:49:02.430]  is just in perilous times for sure.
[01:49:02.430 --> 01:49:11.030]  But I did want to ask you about something on a side note as helping you guys open InfoWars.
[01:49:11.030 --> 01:49:16.670]  I've been listening for well over a decade, been supporting and stuff.
[01:49:16.670 --> 01:49:21.670]  I sent you guys a sleeping bag and I was trying to, you know, sponsor with you guys that my
[01:49:21.670 --> 01:49:23.230]  comfy sleeping bag.
[01:49:23.230 --> 01:49:27.710]  I don't know if I'm just going to stop you right there because I'm just not the guy to
[01:49:27.710 --> 01:49:28.710]  talk to.
[01:49:28.710 --> 01:49:29.710]  And I'm almost out of time.
[01:49:29.710 --> 01:49:30.710]  I want to take other people's calls.
[01:49:30.710 --> 01:49:36.190]  But if the crew just if you want to get his email information or something like that,
[01:49:36.190 --> 01:49:39.710]  or he can he can even email me if you guys want to give him my InfoWars email.
[01:49:39.710 --> 01:49:41.110]  That's fine, too.
[01:49:41.110 --> 01:49:44.350]  But but I want to take other calls on stuff, Michael, but I thank you for the call.
[01:49:44.350 --> 01:49:46.190]  Let's go to Alex in Michigan.
[01:49:46.190 --> 01:49:48.390]  Alex, you're on the air.
[01:49:48.390 --> 01:49:49.390]  Go ahead.
[01:49:49.390 --> 01:49:54.190]  It's good to talk to you, buddy.
[01:49:54.190 --> 01:49:55.190]  Thanks for calling.
[01:49:55.190 --> 01:49:56.190]  Love hearing from you.
[01:49:56.190 --> 01:49:57.190]  Real quick.
[01:49:57.190 --> 01:49:58.190]  I had a product plug.
[01:49:58.190 --> 01:50:01.230]  I just wanted to shout this out.
[01:50:01.230 --> 01:50:03.950]  I don't think you guys have it in stock right now.
[01:50:03.950 --> 01:50:08.630]  But the Survival Shield X2 is amazing and out of stock.
[01:50:08.630 --> 01:50:09.630]  That's too bad.
[01:50:09.630 --> 01:50:10.630]  Well, hopefully we'll have it back fast.
[01:50:10.630 --> 01:50:14.230]  One thing I don't think people know, I'll say this real quick and then get on to my
[01:50:14.230 --> 01:50:15.230]  point.
[01:50:15.230 --> 01:50:22.350]  This has 600 servings in it, 600 servings, and that can last you a long time and it has
[01:50:22.350 --> 01:50:23.350]  a lot of value to it.
[01:50:23.350 --> 01:50:24.350]  I have to be honest.
[01:50:24.350 --> 01:50:25.350]  I'm a hoarder.
[01:50:25.350 --> 01:50:27.790]  I'm a Survival Shield X2 hoarder.
[01:50:27.790 --> 01:50:28.790]  I'm not kidding.
[01:50:28.790 --> 01:50:29.790]  I have a whole collection.
[01:50:29.790 --> 01:50:33.590]  It's like an in-case-an-emergency thing, part of my bug-out stuff.
[01:50:33.590 --> 01:50:35.550]  I'm waiting for you guys to get it back in, brother.
[01:50:35.550 --> 01:50:42.270]  But my point that I was calling in today was the gun-free zones that the Detroit City Council
[01:50:42.270 --> 01:50:49.150]  is trying to put into action in certain areas of the city that I used to go to a lot, kind
[01:50:49.150 --> 01:50:50.150]  of ill-advised.
[01:50:50.150 --> 01:50:52.950]  Detroit's not the safest city in the nation.
[01:50:52.950 --> 01:50:53.950]  Oh, yeah.
[01:50:53.950 --> 01:50:54.950]  You don't say.
[01:50:55.110 --> 01:51:01.030]  They're trying to put in these new gun-free zones in Greek Town and the Riverwalk, which
[01:51:01.030 --> 01:51:02.030]  I used to.
[01:51:02.030 --> 01:51:03.030]  I'm a CPL holder.
[01:51:03.030 --> 01:51:06.270]  I'd take my wife down there, go for a nice stroll by the river.
[01:51:06.270 --> 01:51:11.070]  And now it's to the point where if they're going to start enacting these new restrictions,
[01:51:11.070 --> 01:51:12.990]  I'm not even going to go to the city anymore.
[01:51:12.990 --> 01:51:17.390]  Well, let's call it what it is, like a federal judge has now.
[01:51:17.390 --> 01:51:23.310]  Federal judge halts states—this is in Illinois, so your neighbor there—federal judge halts
[01:51:23.790 --> 01:51:28.110]  state's new assault weapon ban, cites likely Second Amendment violation.
[01:51:28.110 --> 01:51:29.110]  Oh, really?
[01:51:29.110 --> 01:51:30.110]  Duh!
[01:51:30.110 --> 01:51:31.670]  Shall not be infringed?
[01:51:31.670 --> 01:51:35.350]  Yeah, so these gun-free zones are totally Second Amendment violations.
[01:51:35.350 --> 01:51:36.350]  That's the right idea.
[01:51:36.350 --> 01:51:37.350]  Absolutely.
[01:51:37.350 --> 01:51:42.390]  And they make it sound like it's going to keep the city safer and it's going to try
[01:51:42.390 --> 01:51:44.070]  to help prevent gun crimes.
[01:51:44.070 --> 01:51:45.670]  Look, there's no other way to put it.
[01:51:45.670 --> 01:51:49.070]  It's just like the ex-U.S. Army PSYOP expert said.
[01:51:49.070 --> 01:51:53.990]  We live in a land of semi-lobotomized, quasi-retarded people.
[01:51:53.990 --> 01:51:59.710]  Anybody who thinks putting up a sign that says gun-free zone or signing a law that says
[01:51:59.710 --> 01:52:04.390]  gun-free zone is going to stop a criminal with a gun is part of the semi-lobotomized,
[01:52:04.390 --> 01:52:06.130]  quasi-retarded population.
[01:52:06.130 --> 01:52:11.590]  By the way, that ex-U.S. Army PSYOP expert might be a guest on InfoWars soon.
[01:52:11.590 --> 01:52:12.590]  Just throwing it out there.
[01:52:12.590 --> 01:52:13.590]  Maybe that'll happen.
[01:52:13.590 --> 01:52:14.790]  Alex, thank you for the call.
[01:52:14.790 --> 01:52:17.510]  Let's go to Andrew in New York.
[01:52:17.510 --> 01:52:18.510]  You're on the air.
[01:52:18.510 --> 01:52:19.510]  Go ahead.
[01:52:19.510 --> 01:52:25.350]  So, like, remote viewing is, like, when, like, uh, they had it, actually, for, like, intelligence
[01:52:25.350 --> 01:52:26.350]  agencies and stuff.
[01:52:26.350 --> 01:52:31.950]  They were actually able to see, like, from a distance, like, even, like, into, like,
[01:52:31.950 --> 01:52:36.390]  military bases and stuff, like, like, sensitive, like, information and stuff.
[01:52:36.390 --> 01:52:37.390]  All right.
[01:52:37.390 --> 01:52:38.390]  I've got to stop you.
[01:52:38.390 --> 01:52:45.350]  You jump right into a deep, deep subject material without providing any context at all.
[01:52:46.190 --> 01:52:55.430]  Uh, well, it was, like, in the MKUltra, um, one of the, one of the programs was, uh, like,
[01:52:55.430 --> 01:52:56.430]  remote viewing.
[01:52:56.430 --> 01:53:01.150]  It's, like, psychic, like, abilities and, like, people, like, working for, like, intelligence
[01:53:01.150 --> 01:53:02.150]  agencies, like.
[01:53:02.150 --> 01:53:04.150]  So, like, stuff in Stranger Things?
[01:53:04.150 --> 01:53:05.150]  Yeah.
[01:53:05.150 --> 01:53:06.150]  Stuff like that.
[01:53:06.150 --> 01:53:09.790]  I think there's a movie that, like, uh, men hystericals, too.
[01:53:09.790 --> 01:53:10.790]  Yeah, right.
[01:53:10.790 --> 01:53:11.790]  George Clooney.
[01:53:11.790 --> 01:53:12.790]  Yeah.
[01:53:12.790 --> 01:53:13.790]  Yeah.
[01:53:13.950 --> 01:53:14.950]  Yeah.
[01:53:14.950 --> 01:53:15.950]  Yeah.
[01:53:15.950 --> 01:53:19.470]  Like, uh, governments, like, doing all kinds of experiments, like, hydrants, like, affecting
[01:53:19.470 --> 01:53:22.950]  reality, like, people could affect reality with their, their mind and stuff and, like,
[01:53:22.950 --> 01:53:23.950]  they really have to hide.
[01:53:23.950 --> 01:53:24.950]  Well, sure.
[01:53:24.950 --> 01:53:25.950]  And, you know, this is, this is what I'm saying.
[01:53:25.950 --> 01:53:29.550]  You're, you're jumping into this deep subject material and, and people probably hear you,
[01:53:29.550 --> 01:53:30.550]  like, what is he talking about?
[01:53:30.550 --> 01:53:32.970]  Well, think of it like this, folks.
[01:53:32.970 --> 01:53:38.570]  Really, you know, we, we think of space as a mystery and, and something to be explored,
[01:53:38.570 --> 01:53:40.810]  but the human mind is the mystery.
[01:53:40.810 --> 01:53:47.050]  The human brain is what's to be explored and you have the U.S. government and other governments
[01:53:47.050 --> 01:53:52.750]  running all kinds of secret operations, figuring out how they can use and abuse and manipulate
[01:53:52.750 --> 01:53:57.450]  the human mind and what type of things the human brain is capable of that we just can't
[01:53:57.450 --> 01:53:59.450]  get access to for whatever reason.
[01:53:59.450 --> 01:54:01.450]  It's well known we only use, like, 13 percent of our brain.
[01:54:01.450 --> 01:54:06.090]  I mean, even the smartest person will use, like, 15 percent, uh, you know, maybe the
[01:54:06.090 --> 01:54:09.130]  average liberal, maybe, maybe the average liberal 4 percent.
[01:54:09.130 --> 01:54:13.350]  But the point is, we have all these abilities as humans, we have all these untapped abilities
[01:54:13.350 --> 01:54:17.970]  in our brains that we can't access for some reason that, uh, they run all kinds of tests
[01:54:17.970 --> 01:54:23.170]  and, and try to find out how they can access that and, uh, yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's
[01:54:23.170 --> 01:54:26.850]  deep stuff, Andrew, but we're short on time and I want to take other calls here.
[01:54:26.850 --> 01:54:30.770]  So let's go to Randy in Oklahoma.
[01:54:30.770 --> 01:54:32.090]  Randy, you're on the air.
[01:54:32.090 --> 01:54:33.090]  Go ahead.
[01:54:33.090 --> 01:54:34.090]  Hey, Owen.
[01:54:34.090 --> 01:54:35.650]  You did an awesome job, brother.
[01:54:36.210 --> 01:54:37.210]  Thank you for calling.
[01:54:37.210 --> 01:54:38.210]  Let me be real direct.
[01:54:38.210 --> 01:54:43.690]  The previous caller, your response was excellent because, yeah, 15 percent of the human brain
[01:54:43.690 --> 01:54:50.650]  at a max, there's a secret to bypassing that, uh, we get overloaded, okay?
[01:54:50.650 --> 01:54:55.130]  There's a secret that God provided in the Holy Spirit, right?
[01:54:55.130 --> 01:55:00.690]  When you learn how to pray in the Spirit, go look at Jude 20, you know, doing this in
[01:55:00.690 --> 01:55:01.690]  love.
[01:55:01.690 --> 01:55:02.690]  Yes.
[01:55:02.690 --> 01:55:03.690]  You will destroy the enemy.
[01:55:03.690 --> 01:55:04.690]  Yes, exactly.
[01:55:04.730 --> 01:55:07.850]  And what he's talking about, folks, it's, see, this is the stuff they keep.
[01:55:07.850 --> 01:55:10.090]  This is the stuff they do secretly and they don't tell you.
[01:55:10.090 --> 01:55:11.090]  Some of it gets out.
[01:55:11.090 --> 01:55:14.970]  Like when you, if you can map the human brain, which is not perfectly mapped, but if you
[01:55:14.970 --> 01:55:19.970]  can map the human brain and the brain activity, what Randy is talking about here is you can
[01:55:19.970 --> 01:55:24.690]  map it when you are spiritual or when you're grounded or when you're on your knees praying
[01:55:24.690 --> 01:55:28.410]  to God, there's activity in the brain that normally wouldn't be there.
[01:55:28.410 --> 01:55:31.770]  You're firing up a part of the brain that otherwise is dormant.
[01:55:31.770 --> 01:55:38.450]  And this is why they like to test with these drugs like LSD and DMT because they run these
[01:55:38.450 --> 01:55:43.010]  tests and they can activate these parts of the brains that they can't get access to normally.
[01:55:43.010 --> 01:55:47.130]  And it's like these drugs are like the gateway, the chemical gateway to doing such a thing.
[01:55:47.130 --> 01:55:50.730]  There's a spiritual gateway to doing such a thing also.
[01:55:50.730 --> 01:55:58.170]  And that's why the, the expert Buddhist monks will sit in silence or sit in solidarity or
[01:55:58.170 --> 01:56:04.570]  sit in darkness for years and they'll reach such a place of deep trance that they can
[01:56:04.570 --> 01:56:07.730]  actually see other worlds.
[01:56:07.730 --> 01:56:11.210]  So you can chemically do this stuff with DMT.
[01:56:11.210 --> 01:56:14.930]  You can also do it spiritually, but that's like expert master level.
[01:56:14.930 --> 01:56:22.170]  In fact, what is the great philosopher, Alan Watts talked about this, how using drugs is
[01:56:22.170 --> 01:56:25.890]  just a shortcut, a chemical shortcut, kind of a cheat code.
[01:56:25.890 --> 01:56:27.970]  He didn't, he didn't really like it.
[01:56:27.970 --> 01:56:32.690]  A cheat code to, to, to understanding that spirituality or, or understanding that, that
[01:56:32.690 --> 01:56:40.130]  deep, deep consciousness or, or even the connection to creation that you can feel when you, when
[01:56:40.130 --> 01:56:43.370]  you have it, but it's like cheating when you do that with chemicals.
[01:56:43.370 --> 01:56:44.370]  Yeah.
[01:56:44.370 --> 01:56:49.290]  Now let, just don't confuse what the Holy Spirit does with what a Buddhist does or DMT or some
[01:56:49.290 --> 01:56:50.290]  psychedelic.
[01:56:50.290 --> 01:56:52.450]  There is total difference.
[01:56:52.450 --> 01:56:58.930]  When the Holy Spirit takes over and bypasses your soul, so where your emotions and your,
[01:56:58.930 --> 01:57:03.890]  and your intellect are actually set aside, you read what Jesus said about the spirit
[01:57:03.890 --> 01:57:08.610]  of truth that he would send after he ascended, he set the spirit of truth, right?
[01:57:08.610 --> 01:57:11.210]  And you allow, you get filled with the Holy Spirit.
[01:57:11.210 --> 01:57:14.530]  He will, it's like downloading programs and then you install it.
[01:57:14.530 --> 01:57:19.530]  You know, you can download the most ancient, the most ancient knowledge there is.
[01:57:19.530 --> 01:57:20.530]  Yeah.
[01:57:20.610 --> 01:57:21.610]  Yeah.
[01:57:21.610 --> 01:57:24.290]  It's instantly available to you.
[01:57:24.290 --> 01:57:29.530]  You do need to understand Christ is King, Jesus is Lord, and then you can do it.
[01:57:29.530 --> 01:57:33.410]  Well, Randy, unfortunately we're out of time for tonight's transmission, but thank you
[01:57:33.410 --> 01:57:34.410]  for the call.
[01:57:34.410 --> 01:57:38.130]  Sorry to the other callers we couldn't get to.
[01:57:38.130 --> 01:57:41.050]  And ladies and gentlemen, we've got something special coming up here on Sunday night live.
[01:57:41.050 --> 01:57:42.050]  Don't tune out.
[01:57:42.050 --> 01:57:43.050]  Info Wars.
[01:57:43.050 --> 01:57:45.410]  We'll be back tomorrow morning with Harrison Smith, Alex Jones, and myself.
[01:57:45.410 --> 01:57:49.530]  We'll see you then.
[01:57:49.530 --> 01:57:54.330]  Turbo Force is back, sold out for eight months and it's Turbo Force Plus.
[01:57:54.330 --> 01:57:56.490]  We made it even stronger.
[01:57:56.490 --> 01:58:00.410]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[01:58:00.410 --> 01:58:07.130]  Turbo Force is back in stock at infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:58:07.130 --> 01:58:13.650]  It's not just wide spectrum natural herbs that time release over 10 hours, should be
[01:58:13.650 --> 01:58:15.290]  called 10 hour energy.
[01:58:15.290 --> 01:58:20.730]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids
[01:58:20.730 --> 01:58:25.890]  that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name
[01:58:25.890 --> 01:58:26.890]  it.
[01:58:26.890 --> 01:58:30.690]  It is the super fuel.
[01:58:30.690 --> 01:58:32.130]  Rainforce Plus is great.
[01:58:32.130 --> 01:58:33.130]  Rainforce Ultra is great.
[01:58:33.130 --> 01:58:34.130]  They're two different nootropics.
[01:58:34.130 --> 01:58:35.130]  They go good with this.
[01:58:35.130 --> 01:58:37.650]  But this is the King Kong.
[01:58:37.650 --> 01:58:39.250]  This is the boss.
[01:58:39.250 --> 01:58:43.050]  Turbo Force back in stock, discounted, infowarsstore.com.
[01:58:43.490 --> 01:58:45.930]  More power, more strength, more energy.
[01:58:49.930 --> 01:58:53.050]  Infowars, tomorrow's news today.
[01:58:53.370 --> 01:58:54.370]  This is their big move.
[01:58:55.050 --> 01:58:58.530]  So, yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States?
[01:58:58.850 --> 01:59:00.010]  He doesn't care.
[01:59:00.610 --> 01:59:01.850]  That's not his job.
[01:59:01.850 --> 01:59:03.650]  He's not the president of the United States.
[01:59:03.650 --> 01:59:06.370]  He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[01:59:07.370 --> 01:59:11.410]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased.
[01:59:12.050 --> 01:59:13.330]  They must be opposed.
[01:59:13.810 --> 01:59:16.690]  And that's why autocrats only understand one word.
[01:59:17.050 --> 01:59:19.770]  No, no, no.
[01:59:19.890 --> 01:59:23.530]  Exactly. And that's why we say no to your vaccines.
[01:59:24.450 --> 01:59:27.370]  We say no to you shutting down our businesses.
[01:59:27.530 --> 01:59:29.930]  We say no to you taking our firearms.
[01:59:30.010 --> 01:59:32.410]  We say no to you censoring our free speech.
[01:59:32.530 --> 01:59:36.010]  We say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization.
[01:59:36.130 --> 01:59:38.570]  We say no to you getting us into World War Three.
[01:59:38.690 --> 01:59:41.370]  You're right. We stand against autocrats like you.
[01:59:41.410 --> 01:59:43.890]  Joe Biden. And we say no.
[01:59:44.010 --> 01:59:45.810]  And we say no to your war.
[01:59:50.410 --> 01:59:54.730]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:59:54.970 --> 01:59:56.650]  It's Alex Jones.
