[00:00.000 --> 00:27.520]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show on this Tuesday, January the 10th, 2017.
[00:27.520 --> 00:29.000]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[00:29.000 --> 00:34.280]  Today, of course, we're going to be talking about what is first and foremost in the news
[00:34.280 --> 00:37.120]  cycle and that is Jeff Sessions' confirmation hearings.
[00:37.120 --> 00:40.600]  We're going to have a lot of confirmation hearings because we've only got about nine
[00:40.600 --> 00:44.840]  days left before the inauguration and there's a lot of people in the Trump cabinet that
[00:44.840 --> 00:46.600]  need to be confirmed.
[00:46.600 --> 00:49.640]  So there's going to be a lot of hearings, of course, the first one up and it's fitting
[00:49.640 --> 00:53.120]  that the first person coming up for the hearing would be Jeff Sessions because he was the
[00:53.120 --> 00:56.640]  first person to take a stand for Donald Trump.
[00:56.640 --> 01:02.880]  And of course, he was the only person in the Senate to even bother to read this massive
[01:02.880 --> 01:07.440]  Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement and to warn us about what was in it.
[01:07.440 --> 01:10.240]  And so we're indebted to him for that.
[01:10.240 --> 01:15.000]  We're indebted to him for the things that he has given to Donald Trump, explaining this
[01:15.000 --> 01:16.000]  to him.
[01:16.000 --> 01:17.000]  Donald Trump listened.
[01:17.000 --> 01:18.000]  The rest of the Senate didn't.
[01:18.000 --> 01:19.280]  Jeff Sessions read all that.
[01:19.280 --> 01:23.800]  He put together a big presentation with his staff and nobody would listen to him on Capitol
[01:23.800 --> 01:24.800]  Hill.
[01:24.800 --> 01:25.800]  Very telling.
[01:25.800 --> 01:31.040]  And of course, now he had turned over one of his key staff members, became a key staff
[01:31.040 --> 01:36.320]  member for Donald Trump, and he is now going to be writing the inaugural speech for him.
[01:36.320 --> 01:38.040]  So a lot of involvement there with Donald Trump.
[01:38.040 --> 01:43.240]  So that's one of the reasons why the Democrats want to attack him.
[01:43.240 --> 01:48.520]  The other reason, of course, is that we've got people like Cory Booker, who is out of
[01:48.520 --> 01:54.440]  nothing but personal ambition, making false accusations about Jeff Sessions.
[01:54.440 --> 01:57.000]  Cory Booker, of course, is going to run for president.
[01:57.000 --> 02:00.280]  This is a very glib, friendly face that we see out there.
[02:00.280 --> 02:03.840]  He's going to run, and he's now playing the race card.
[02:03.840 --> 02:09.000]  He's putting himself out there saying, hey, I'm going to be available to do whatever you
[02:09.000 --> 02:10.000]  want.
[02:10.000 --> 02:11.800]  Nothing is beneath me.
[02:11.800 --> 02:13.680]  And it's kind of like the end of The Incredibles.
[02:13.680 --> 02:14.680]  I am the underminer.
[02:14.680 --> 02:17.920]  I may be beneath you, but nothing is beneath me.
[02:17.920 --> 02:21.240]  That should be Cory Booker's theme song, okay?
[02:21.240 --> 02:22.840]  Because he knows better than that.
[02:22.840 --> 02:28.320]  And of course, you've probably seen now the clips where he makes these announcements about
[02:28.320 --> 02:35.280]  Jeff Sessions, where they had a civil rights award that they put together, and he complimented
[02:35.280 --> 02:38.120]  Jeff Sessions on the work that he had done.
[02:38.120 --> 02:42.880]  And now he is completely trashing him playing the race card.
[02:42.880 --> 02:43.880]  So we're going to talk about that.
[02:43.880 --> 02:48.480]  We've also got the inventor of email joining us today for the very first time, Dr. Shiva
[02:48.480 --> 02:54.000]  Ayaduray, and he's going to be talking to us not only about that, but about the military
[02:54.000 --> 02:55.000]  industrial complex.
[02:55.000 --> 02:59.640]  But the key thing that we brought him on to talk about is GMO.
[02:59.640 --> 03:07.160]  He is a biologist, a biological engineer, actually by his PhD, he went to the MIT Department
[03:07.160 --> 03:12.280]  of Biological Engineering, has a PhD in systems biology, so he's going to be talking to us
[03:12.280 --> 03:17.320]  about the dangers of GMO and how these things are all related.
[03:17.320 --> 03:20.680]  And also, we're going to be taking a look at updates from stories yesterday.
[03:20.680 --> 03:22.480]  We're going to get into that right after the break.
[03:22.480 --> 03:28.280]  We've had some fact checking done on Donald Trump as to whether or not Meryl Streep is
[03:28.280 --> 03:29.280]  overrated.
[03:29.280 --> 03:33.840]  What a ridiculous thing that is, to fact check that kind of an opinion.
[03:33.840 --> 03:39.720]  I mean, we know, as I said yesterday, the Golden Globes are totally phony, so phony
[03:39.720 --> 03:44.360]  that they stopped broadcasting them for a number of years on NBC as the FCC warned them
[03:44.360 --> 03:45.360]  about it.
[03:45.360 --> 03:49.800]  Phony is to all the award shows, but somebody's going to fact check whether or not Meryl Streep
[03:49.800 --> 03:51.000]  is overrated or not.
[03:51.000 --> 03:56.000]  We also have some interesting developments on climate change that are coming out.
[03:56.000 --> 03:59.840]  And, of course, you can see this article, Climate Depot, Provedo Scientists are now
[03:59.840 --> 04:01.640]  warning that we're in a new ice age.
[04:01.640 --> 04:08.000]  We're going to take a look at how CBS spun the report on this Chicago torture victim
[04:08.000 --> 04:09.720]  said he was actually attacked by white.
[04:09.720 --> 04:11.120]  So we're going to be taking a look at all of that.
[04:11.120 --> 04:16.800]  We're also going to look at some news stories that are breaking today besides Jeff Sessions.
[04:16.800 --> 04:23.560]  We have the U.S. Small Business Optimism is surging the most since 1980.
[04:23.560 --> 04:24.560]  What happened in 1980?
[04:24.560 --> 04:28.280]  Oh, well, that was when Ronald Reagan became president.
[04:28.280 --> 04:32.400]  People know that things are going to be good when you've got a president-elect who's talking
[04:32.400 --> 04:36.080]  about cutting regulation and cutting taxes.
[04:36.080 --> 04:40.200]  And yet yesterday, yesterday evening, there was a town hall meeting in Vermont, Bernie
[04:40.200 --> 04:45.360]  Sanders was called on over-regulation and over-taxation by, and guess what, a small
[04:45.360 --> 04:48.120]  businessman and Bernie Sanders doubled down.
[04:48.120 --> 04:49.120]  Stay with us.
[04:49.120 --> 05:00.160]  We're going to be right back with a lot of breaking news.
[05:00.160 --> 05:04.240]  Well, as Al Sharpton promised, there were protesters at Jeff Sessions' hearing today
[05:04.240 --> 05:06.680]  chanting, no racist, no KKK.
[05:06.680 --> 05:10.680]  Meanwhile, Sessions was speaking inside to the importance of civil rights.
[05:10.680 --> 05:15.160]  The man fought for civil rights and desegregation in the South for years, more than most attorneys
[05:15.160 --> 05:19.120]  at the time, and people are outside protesting his racism.
[05:19.120 --> 05:21.920]  Multiple protesters made it inside and were arrested.
[05:21.920 --> 05:25.960]  The adults inside were also discussing law enforcement, which Sessions says he supports,
[05:25.960 --> 05:30.080]  a drug epidemic, which Sessions said he would fight, the Clinton email server and the Clinton
[05:30.080 --> 05:34.280]  Foundation were brought up, and Sessions said if these cases reached his desk, he would
[05:34.280 --> 05:36.880]  recuse himself as unfit to be impartial.
[05:36.880 --> 05:41.320]  Diane Feinstein decided to bring up the importance of the rover's weight decision and how important
[05:41.320 --> 05:43.680]  it is to make sure abortions are available.
[05:43.680 --> 05:48.200]  So fearing all those babies might be saved, Feinstein asked Sessions if he would respect
[05:48.200 --> 05:49.200]  that decision.
[05:49.200 --> 05:52.240]  Sessions said he disagreed with the law, but respects it as law.
[05:52.240 --> 05:54.480]  So Jeff Sessions will be the attorney general.
[05:54.480 --> 05:56.240]  The protests have failed again.
[05:56.240 --> 05:59.920]  This is Owen Schreuer for Infowars.com.
[05:59.920 --> 06:04.480]  I want to encourage all of you to remember how high the stakes really are right now in
[06:04.480 --> 06:07.400]  the battle for freedom, and the information war is paramount.
[06:07.400 --> 06:11.600]  That's why it's more important than ever that you spread the word about Infowars.com and
[06:11.600 --> 06:15.640]  send out the links so people can watch the free feeds and get the free podcasts and download
[06:15.640 --> 06:19.400]  the free iPhone and droid apps at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[06:19.400 --> 06:24.200]  It is critical that we be able to email you when we're being cyber attacked or shut down.
[06:24.200 --> 06:28.000]  Sign up to get our email alerts at Infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[06:28.000 --> 06:32.760]  And finally, we have launched our new free app at Infowars.com forward slash app.
[06:32.760 --> 06:34.880]  You can download it on iPhone and droid.
[06:34.880 --> 06:39.200]  Once you've downloaded the free app at Infowars.com forward slash app, you can then of you choose
[06:39.200 --> 06:42.280]  pay 4.95 a month to get Infowars Prime.
[06:42.280 --> 06:47.320]  We produce documentaries, special reports, live events and so much more on a daily and
[06:47.320 --> 06:49.640]  weekly basis just for Prime members.
[06:49.640 --> 06:54.280]  We also have daily specials, sometimes as much as 50% off for members of Infowars Prime.
[06:54.280 --> 06:56.080]  Infowars has come a long way.
[06:56.080 --> 06:59.840]  And Infowars Prime is just one more weapon in the fight for liberty.
[06:59.840 --> 07:04.240]  More than two years ago, Infowars first told you about our research into what has been
[07:04.240 --> 07:06.240]  called the iodine conspiracy.
[07:06.240 --> 07:10.320]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can
[07:10.320 --> 07:15.520]  devastate IQ and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and
[07:15.520 --> 07:19.280]  adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family into the water.
[07:19.280 --> 07:22.960]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[07:22.960 --> 07:27.520]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling
[07:27.520 --> 07:29.960]  you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[07:29.960 --> 07:35.400]  Now in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between
[07:35.400 --> 07:41.200]  iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation
[07:41.200 --> 07:42.800]  ever concerning iodine.
[07:42.800 --> 07:44.760]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[07:44.760 --> 07:49.040]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to
[07:49.040 --> 07:51.280]  any optimum health regimen.

[08:21.280 --> 08:23.120]  Welcome to the Alex Jones radio show.
[08:23.120 --> 08:26.640]  I'm David Knight on this Tuesday, January the 10th, 2017.
[08:26.640 --> 08:32.880]  We are now nine days away from the Trump inauguration, and the confirmation hearings are beginning.
[08:32.880 --> 08:34.760]  And of course, the first person up is Jeff Sessions.
[08:34.760 --> 08:39.160]  Now Roger Stone is going to be joining us in the second hour to break down the politics
[08:39.160 --> 08:40.720]  of what's going on in Capitol Hill.
[08:40.720 --> 08:44.680]  We also have Alex Jones is going to be joining us at the bottom of the hour talking about
[08:44.680 --> 08:49.560]  the attacks on free speech, the attacks on Matt Drudge, the attacks on Infowars, and
[08:49.560 --> 08:52.280]  of course, the attacks, in general, on the Internet.
[08:52.280 --> 08:54.360]  So he'll be joining us at the bottom of the hour.
[08:54.360 --> 09:00.560]  And you know as we go back and we look at this, you might say, even if you do at this
[09:00.560 --> 09:06.040]  point, believe this ridiculous red herring narrative that the Russians hacked our elections.
[09:06.040 --> 09:09.280]  Of course, it was Hillary Clinton being exposed.
[09:09.280 --> 09:13.360]  And I can imagine if you're anywhere close to Hillary, if you're anywhere in that area
[09:13.360 --> 09:17.560]  of upstate New York, you can probably hear her along on wherever it is that she lives
[09:17.560 --> 09:19.320]  outside of the city.
[09:19.320 --> 09:24.240]  You could probably hear her screaming at the top of her voice, I wish email had never
[09:24.240 --> 09:25.240]  been invented.
[09:25.240 --> 09:27.240]  Well, we have the guy who invented email today.
[09:27.240 --> 09:31.800]  So I guess we could say, we got the guy who took down Hillary Clinton because we got a
[09:31.800 --> 09:34.360]  glimpse of her hoisted up there.
[09:34.360 --> 09:38.240]  He gave her enough rope, I guess enough technology that she actually hung herself.
[09:38.240 --> 09:41.640]  And when we saw her up there, got a glimpse, we said, ooh, don't want that.
[09:41.640 --> 09:42.640]  Okay.
[09:42.640 --> 09:44.080]  So that's we got him on.
[09:44.080 --> 09:45.800]  Now he is the inventor of email.
[09:45.800 --> 09:47.520]  We're not going to talk to him about email so much.
[09:47.520 --> 09:51.200]  We will talk to him about the military industrial complex because he's got some very strong
[09:51.200 --> 09:52.200]  opinions about that.
[09:52.200 --> 09:57.040]  But he has a biological engineering, has a PhD in biological engineering in systems
[09:57.040 --> 09:58.400]  biology.
[09:58.400 --> 10:02.080]  And as part of his research, one of the things that we reported on here in Info Wars a few
[10:02.080 --> 10:07.200]  days ago, maybe I think it was the end of last week, was something that he discovered
[10:07.200 --> 10:12.160]  in his work as a biologist about GMOs.
[10:12.160 --> 10:13.520]  And so we're going to talk to him about that.
[10:13.520 --> 10:18.720]  We're going to talk to him about his development of email and other technological issues and
[10:18.720 --> 10:24.120]  about the military industrial and academic complex because that's all a part of it.
[10:24.120 --> 10:28.560]  Now we've had a lot of news that's breaking and we're going to take a look at Jeff Sessions.
[10:28.560 --> 10:31.880]  As a matter of fact, before we get started with some of the updates on some of the news
[10:31.880 --> 10:34.600]  that we saw yesterday, let's take a look at what's just been happening.
[10:34.600 --> 10:38.240]  One of the interesting things that just came out was that Jeff Sessions said that he will
[10:38.240 --> 10:44.760]  recuse himself from any possible prosecutions of Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation.
[10:44.760 --> 10:48.400]  That is going to be interesting to see what happens with that.
[10:48.400 --> 10:52.800]  And of course, you could look at that as good news, bad news.
[10:52.800 --> 10:56.880]  One, he thinks when he says that he would recuse himself, unless it was somebody, I
[10:56.880 --> 11:00.040]  don't know, to say that you're going to recuse yourself is not saying there isn't going to
[11:00.040 --> 11:01.040]  be any investigation.
[11:01.040 --> 11:02.040]  So that's a good news.
[11:02.040 --> 11:08.200]  We don't necessarily have to have Jeff Sessions lead the investigation of Hillary Clinton.
[11:08.200 --> 11:09.920]  It's good enough just to have one.
[11:09.920 --> 11:14.000]  So to say that I'm going to recuse myself from the investigation, that's good.
[11:14.000 --> 11:19.320]  Because that would remove some of the claims of partisan politics that are going to be
[11:19.320 --> 11:20.320]  made.
[11:20.320 --> 11:22.160]  And of course, they will be made about that.
[11:22.160 --> 11:23.760]  But it's something that needs to move forward.
[11:23.760 --> 11:28.480]  I hope that the Trump administration will move forward with that.
[11:28.480 --> 11:31.320]  But that's the first thing we saw.
[11:31.320 --> 11:35.700]  But actually, a little bit before he made that announcement, of course, we have the
[11:35.700 --> 11:39.080]  race card that is being played on Jeff Sessions.
[11:39.080 --> 11:45.960]  In a totally unprecedented way, Cory Booker is prostituting himself to the racist left
[11:45.960 --> 11:52.160]  saying that he's going to do whatever he needs to to play this beloved race card that the
[11:52.160 --> 11:53.160]  Democrats have.
[11:53.160 --> 11:58.520]  So they had some people dress up in Ku Klux Klan outfits and disrupt the Senate hearing
[11:58.520 --> 11:59.520]  today.
[11:59.520 --> 12:09.520]  There's a little clip of what happened today earlier.
[12:09.520 --> 12:21.400]  So I guess at this point, you see them throwing them out.
[12:21.400 --> 12:25.720]  And I guess they're going to go get their lawyer Morris D's, the guy who founded Southern
[12:25.720 --> 12:27.560]  Poverty Law Center.
[12:27.560 --> 12:31.600]  Get Morris D's on the phone, because if you're the Ku Klux Klan and you're ironically in
[12:31.600 --> 12:36.000]  Alabama where Jeff Sessions is, who do you turn to for legal help?
[12:36.000 --> 12:41.000]  Well, if it's in the middle of the Civil Rights or the beginning of the Civil Rights movement,
[12:41.000 --> 12:46.360]  and you've got a bunch of people that get beaten up and they're bus burned in Alabama,
[12:46.360 --> 12:52.280]  they turn to Morris D's, the guy who ran the Southern Poverty Law Center 10 years later.
[12:52.280 --> 12:53.760]  Morris D's got the Klan off.
[12:53.760 --> 12:58.160]  They paid him a fortune at the time, and the dollars that were available there, it was
[12:58.160 --> 13:00.840]  more than a family of four would make.
[13:00.840 --> 13:05.600]  And Morris D's set out the rest of the Civil Rights movement and then started profiting
[13:05.600 --> 13:06.600]  from it.
[13:06.600 --> 13:07.600]  He completely switched sides.
[13:07.600 --> 13:12.440]  He got the mailing list of, I think it was Jimmy Carter when Jimmy Carter was running.
[13:12.440 --> 13:16.280]  It was some Democrat that was running for president, and he said, I'm going to do the
[13:16.280 --> 13:18.280]  direct mail for you.
[13:18.280 --> 13:23.320]  And he got a hold of the list, and then he turned that list into the Southern Poverty
[13:23.320 --> 13:24.800]  Law Center.
[13:24.800 --> 13:30.120]  And all he does is that kind of phony stuff that you saw there at the sessions hearing,
[13:30.120 --> 13:33.000]  the kind of phony stuff that Cory Booker has been doing.
[13:33.000 --> 13:34.720]  That's where the Southern Poverty Law Center hangs out.
[13:34.720 --> 13:37.480]  So maybe those guys, the Ku Klux Klan, they got thrown out of there.
[13:37.480 --> 13:41.360]  The Ku Klux Klan protesters, they can get more seats to defend them now.
[13:41.360 --> 13:42.840]  Now, I want to do a couple of updates.
[13:42.840 --> 13:46.360]  Of course, we talked about Meryl Streep yesterday, and I don't want to beat this thing to death.
[13:46.360 --> 13:47.800]  But I think this is an interesting update.
[13:47.800 --> 13:50.080]  It was up on the Drudge Report.
[13:50.080 --> 13:55.120]  This is from Business Insider, Josh Barrow put this out, and he said, this AP story
[13:55.120 --> 13:59.200]  shows a problem with fact-checking, and the amazing thing is that they go out.
[13:59.200 --> 14:01.560]  The AP has a fact-check.
[14:01.560 --> 14:03.920]  Is Meryl Streep overrated?
[14:03.920 --> 14:06.040]  Trump picks on a decorated star.
[14:06.040 --> 14:10.760]  So Donald Trump has a tweet that says, Meryl Streep, tremendously overrated or whatever.
[14:10.760 --> 14:16.960]  So you gotta understand that winning the Golden Globes is totally meaningless, okay?
[14:16.960 --> 14:21.240]  That's the Hollywood Foreign Press, and that's what they were happy to talk about yesterday.
[14:21.240 --> 14:24.160]  They said, we're three things that Donald Trump really hates.
[14:24.160 --> 14:28.320]  Hollywood, foreigners, and the press, well, it's a garbage organization.
[14:28.320 --> 14:31.600]  I talked about that yesterday, I talked about how the Golden Globes really doesn't mean
[14:31.600 --> 14:32.600]  anything.
[14:32.600 --> 14:35.800]  If you want somebody that really knows what's going on about, read about what Gary Oldman
[14:35.800 --> 14:37.320]  has talked about, the Golden Globes.
[14:37.320 --> 14:38.760]  He's really taking these people down.
[14:38.760 --> 14:40.280]  You get a lot of different metrics that you can use.
[14:40.280 --> 14:41.960]  You can talk about box office.
[14:41.960 --> 14:45.280]  You can talk about these self-congratulatory trophies.
[14:45.280 --> 14:49.760]  If you want to get together and hand each other trophies, that's about as meaningless
[14:49.760 --> 14:53.960]  as winning the Miss Popularity Contest in high school, really.
[14:53.960 --> 14:55.920]  And do people list that on their resume?
[14:55.920 --> 14:57.640]  Maybe some people do list that on their resume.
[14:57.640 --> 15:03.280]  But the point that he makes is, overrated is a statement of an opinion.
[15:03.280 --> 15:04.280]  It's not a fact.
[15:04.280 --> 15:06.480]  There's no way that you can fact check an opinion.
[15:06.480 --> 15:07.480]  See?
[15:07.480 --> 15:08.480]  You understand?
[15:08.480 --> 15:09.480]  It makes a difference there.
[15:09.480 --> 15:11.000]  We're getting so much on the fact checks.
[15:11.000 --> 15:15.480]  Now we can go back and we can fact check Cory Booker by saying, look, he was praising
[15:15.480 --> 15:21.040]  Jeff Sessions not too long ago, and now he's calling him an intolerable racist.
[15:21.040 --> 15:25.120]  Now that's the fact checking, showing this contradiction.
[15:25.120 --> 15:28.800]  Or going back like we did yesterday in the clips that Darren McBrain found, where we
[15:28.800 --> 15:33.760]  had Josh Earnest say, look, I've had 17 intelligence organizations tell me that the Russians did
[15:33.760 --> 15:36.640]  this, whatever this is.
[15:36.640 --> 15:38.920]  And so I have to believe them.
[15:38.920 --> 15:41.160]  And so Darren said, hey, didn't we hear that before?
[15:41.160 --> 15:45.800]  Didn't we hear Colin Powell say, we've got 16 intelligence agencies that told me that
[15:45.800 --> 15:48.240]  we have weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.
[15:48.240 --> 15:50.280]  So I guess we have to go with that.
[15:50.280 --> 15:54.080]  So these are the weapons of mass destruction that they use against us.
[15:54.080 --> 15:56.160]  But he finishes up his story.
[15:56.160 --> 15:57.840]  He says, this is an opinion column.
[15:57.840 --> 16:03.520]  The thoughts expressed are those of the author, just in case the AP wants to fact check that.
[16:03.520 --> 16:06.000]  Another follow up to the story that we've heard a lot about, and of course that was
[16:06.000 --> 16:12.600]  the horrific case of the four black teenagers beating and torturing a mentally handicapped
[16:12.600 --> 16:16.240]  white teenager and streaming it live on Facebook at the time.
[16:16.240 --> 16:21.240]  They forced him to say, F Trump, F white people, they flicked cigarette ashes on a wound that
[16:21.240 --> 16:22.240]  they inflicted on him.
[16:22.240 --> 16:24.440]  They made him drink from the toilet and so forth and so on.
[16:24.440 --> 16:28.640]  Well, how did CBS report this CBS radio?
[16:28.640 --> 16:30.760]  Dean Reynolds, good job, Dean.
[16:30.760 --> 16:35.200]  You're our fake news face of the day here.
[16:35.200 --> 16:36.200]  So this is what he said.
[16:36.200 --> 16:43.600]  In the video, and he's implying that this kid is black and that his tormentors are racist
[16:43.600 --> 16:44.600]  white people.
[16:44.600 --> 16:49.040]  If you listen to this, listen to this and think, if you just hear his characterization
[16:49.040 --> 16:55.680]  of the story, he doesn't define this, but it sounds like a black kid that is being tortured
[16:55.680 --> 16:57.200]  by some white people.
[16:57.200 --> 17:01.400]  In the video, he is choked and repeatedly called the N word.
[17:01.400 --> 17:07.360]  See, when he says that, you think, oh, he's a black guy, okay, they're calling him the
[17:07.360 --> 17:08.440]  N word.
[17:08.440 --> 17:12.600]  His clothes are slashed, he's terrorized with a knife, his alleged captors repeatedly reference
[17:12.600 --> 17:14.080]  Donald Trump.
[17:14.080 --> 17:18.280]  Okay, police are holding four people in connection with the attack.
[17:18.280 --> 17:23.720]  So they say he's choked, he's cut, he's tortured, he's called the N word and his captors reference
[17:23.720 --> 17:24.720]  Donald Trump.
[17:24.720 --> 17:25.720]  There you go.
[17:25.720 --> 17:28.280]  So it was a case of white racism.
[17:28.280 --> 17:32.880]  This is exactly what Cory Booker is doing to Jeff Sessions today.
[17:32.880 --> 17:35.800]  And again, as a point out, we're going to have Roger Stone talking about that when he
[17:35.800 --> 17:38.040]  joins us in the second hour.
[17:38.040 --> 17:44.120]  Now yesterday, we also had, as their final report before the new administration, Fish
[17:44.120 --> 17:47.840]  and Wildlife came out and told us the polar bears are all going to die for the umpteenth
[17:47.840 --> 17:50.160]  time we've heard this now.
[17:50.160 --> 17:51.720]  And so I want to give you an update on that.
[17:51.720 --> 17:55.960]  Two updates on it actually, Washington Times points out that a polar bear conservation
[17:55.960 --> 18:00.600]  group, BLASS Obama administration's climate change alarmism, they say the polar bear was
[18:00.600 --> 18:03.720]  listed as a threatened species in 2008.
[18:03.720 --> 18:08.520]  As a result, they said of declining Arctic sea ice, but its population has proved remarkably
[18:08.520 --> 18:13.080]  resilient, although the Fish and Wildlife people won't mention that.
[18:13.080 --> 18:18.120]  They also don't tell you that the recent decline in population size recorded in one particular
[18:18.120 --> 18:26.400]  area, the southern Beaufort Sea, was caused by thick spring sea ice in 2004 to 2006, not
[18:26.400 --> 18:28.240]  reduced summer ice.
[18:28.240 --> 18:32.840]  So when the ice got too thick, they couldn't get to something that they needed to eat.
[18:32.840 --> 18:35.600]  Okay, but here's the other part of this.
[18:35.600 --> 18:40.840]  This story from Climate Depot, Mark Moreno, PROVDA says scientists now warn of a new ice
[18:40.840 --> 18:46.720]  age as temperatures plummet to minus 80 degrees Fahrenheit in Russia.
[18:46.720 --> 18:50.480]  And this is not just PROVDA, it was PROVDA in Germany, but they were referencing an American
[18:50.480 --> 18:57.960]  scientist report out of Yale, yeah, a Yale scientist, Y. Liu, a recent paper published
[18:57.960 --> 19:03.880]  said that they've overlooked the possibility of collapsed Atlantic meridional overturning
[19:03.880 --> 19:04.880]  circulation.
[19:04.880 --> 19:06.320]  I think I pronounced that right.
[19:06.320 --> 19:09.320]  Should the ocean heat conveyor collapse, he says?
[19:09.320 --> 19:14.120]  There would be a prominent cooling over the northern North Atlantic and neighboring areas.
[19:14.120 --> 19:18.920]  Sea ice increases over Greenland, Iceland, Norwegian seas, and the south of Greenland.
[19:18.920 --> 19:22.720]  In other words, if you want to sum it up, and here's how PROVDA summed it up, and here's
[19:22.720 --> 19:25.640]  how I would sum it up, CO2 has nothing to do with it.
[19:25.640 --> 19:28.960]  Rather, the influence of the sun is the dominant factor.
[19:28.960 --> 19:30.480]  How about that?
[19:30.480 --> 19:33.080]  It was right in front of our face the entire time.
[19:33.080 --> 19:34.720]  It was the sun.
[19:34.720 --> 19:39.960]  You see, they went out and they flipped a coin, and it was like, heads is warming, tails
[19:39.960 --> 19:42.000]  it's cooling, and it's come up tails.
[19:42.000 --> 19:44.560]  It's kind of like when Bill Cosby used to be a comedian.
[19:44.560 --> 19:47.280]  He had that routine about flipping the coin, the American Revolution.
[19:47.280 --> 19:50.920]  Well, these guys are wearing the red suits and marching in a straight line, and we're
[19:50.920 --> 19:54.840]  going to be shooting from behind the walls because it's totally phony.
[19:54.840 --> 20:00.400]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[20:00.400 --> 20:04.840]  We use cell phones against our heads every day, but now a landmark U.S. government study
[20:04.840 --> 20:09.960]  confirms increased health risks from exposure to EMF radiation emitted from these devices.
[20:09.960 --> 20:12.040]  The time to protect yourself is now.

[22:29.040 --> 22:34.040]  powerful enough to purify treated, untreated, or even stagnant pond water.

[24:21.120 --> 24:22.320]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[24:22.320 --> 24:23.320]  I'm David Knight.
[24:23.320 --> 24:27.480]  Going in for Alex, he's going to be joining us at the bottom of the hour with a special
[24:27.480 --> 24:32.200]  report on the attacks on the freedom of the press, the attacks on Matt Drudge, on Infowars,
[24:32.200 --> 24:33.200]  on the Internet in general.
[24:33.200 --> 24:37.880]  And of course, the Internet is completely down and has been now for about 10 days in
[24:37.880 --> 24:38.880]  the Marshall Islands.
[24:38.880 --> 24:40.400]  We'll tell you a little bit about that in just a moment.
[24:40.400 --> 24:44.800]  Before we do, we'll let you know that we now have bio-true selenium back in stock.
[24:44.800 --> 24:49.800]  There's no question that selenium is a very, very important trace mineral that you should
[24:49.800 --> 24:52.480]  have for your health.
[24:52.480 --> 24:53.480]  That's very well known.
[24:53.480 --> 24:57.000]  It supports a thyroid gland, the immune system, DNA production, eyesight.
[24:57.000 --> 24:59.080]  So there's no question that you need selenium.
[24:59.080 --> 25:01.440]  Just take a look at the research out there.
[25:01.440 --> 25:05.720]  But the question is, where do you get a great source, the best source of this?
[25:05.720 --> 25:13.040]  And so we've gone out of our way to produce bio-true selenium made from 100% organic mustard
[25:13.040 --> 25:14.040]  seed.
[25:14.040 --> 25:18.600]  Nearly every other selenium supplement on the market is produced from synthetic selenium.
[25:18.600 --> 25:20.640]  And that's the difference at infowarslife.com.
[25:20.640 --> 25:24.800]  Now, this has been sold out for quite sometimes, been sold out for weeks.
[25:24.800 --> 25:26.360]  It is now back in stock.
[25:26.360 --> 25:28.240]  Just wanted to let you know that that's back in stock.
[25:28.240 --> 25:33.160]  Now, of course, if you were signed up for auto-ship, you don't run out of the things
[25:33.160 --> 25:38.120]  that you need on a regular basis, things that you have made a part of establishing a habit
[25:38.120 --> 25:42.240]  of healthy nutritional baseline supplementation that you've got there.
[25:42.240 --> 25:46.160]  So if you sign up for auto-ship, number one, you're going to get what you want.
[25:46.160 --> 25:48.040]  We'll hold that back and reserve for you.
[25:48.040 --> 25:49.640]  You will get that on a regular basis.
[25:49.640 --> 25:52.680]  You'll also get a 10% discount.
[25:52.680 --> 25:57.160]  And if your regular recurring order is more than $50, you will also get free shipping.
[25:57.160 --> 26:02.080]  We try to incentivize that for you, because it helps us to know what our supply lines
[26:02.080 --> 26:03.080]  are going to be.
[26:03.080 --> 26:04.880]  That helps us to operate more efficiently.
[26:04.880 --> 26:07.520]  So it's a win-win situation, even with that.
[26:07.520 --> 26:09.840]  But that's why we put out these supplementations.
[26:09.840 --> 26:13.960]  And that's why, at the beginning of the year, to help you get into a habit of taking care
[26:13.960 --> 26:17.360]  of your body, everybody is looking at starting new health resolutions at the beginning of
[26:17.360 --> 26:18.360]  the new year.
[26:18.360 --> 26:21.080]  We have a Make Our Bodies Great Again initiative.
[26:21.080 --> 26:24.960]  We put several items at 30% off, several at 20% off.
[26:24.960 --> 26:30.720]  The 30% off items, brain force, super male vitality, survival shield X2, nascent iodine.
[26:30.720 --> 26:33.120]  At 20% off, we have secret 12.
[26:33.120 --> 26:37.880]  That's our vitamin B12 liquid formulation, liver shield, knockout, our all-natural sleep
[26:37.880 --> 26:42.880]  aid, and prostagard, and many others at infowarslife.com.
[26:42.880 --> 26:46.840]  That's part of our New Year's sale that you'll find there.
[26:46.840 --> 26:51.720]  Now as I mentioned at the beginning of the show, last night Bernie Sanders and a Donald
[26:51.720 --> 26:53.480]  Trump supporter went at it with each other.
[26:53.480 --> 26:57.520]  This is reported by CNN, so of course CNN is on Bernie's side.
[26:57.520 --> 27:03.840]  But it was interesting because the small business owner was criticizing him for taxes and regulations.
[27:03.840 --> 27:06.640]  And Bernie Sanders did not back down.
[27:06.640 --> 27:08.720]  He's proud of taxes and regulations.
[27:08.720 --> 27:10.080]  And so he defended them.
[27:10.080 --> 27:14.320]  The small business owner, Jim Jacobs, said he was concerned about the effects of what
[27:14.320 --> 27:17.000]  they call the raft of burdensome regulation.
[27:17.000 --> 27:21.640]  Remember it was just yesterday, there was a story even from the liberal daily news in
[27:21.640 --> 27:26.880]  New York talking about a beloved Chinese restaurant that shut down after over 25 years
[27:26.880 --> 27:29.680]  saying they just couldn't handle the regulation and the taxes.
[27:29.680 --> 27:32.320]  And it wasn't just New York City's excessive regulations.
[27:32.320 --> 27:36.800]  They're also talking about Obamacare and other things that they were being forced to do.
[27:36.800 --> 27:38.480]  That's the reality.
[27:38.480 --> 27:41.640]  And the reality is, the other reality that Bernie Sanders doesn't want to talk about,
[27:41.640 --> 27:43.920]  if you want to see what he values.
[27:43.920 --> 27:47.800]  If you want to see his system in action, take a look at Venezuela.
[27:47.800 --> 27:53.320]  It was Bernie Sanders who was talking in the 1980s about how wonderful the Sandinistas
[27:53.320 --> 27:54.320]  and Nicaragua were.
[27:54.320 --> 27:58.880]  And that's why I called him Bernie Sandinista because he wouldn't even take that back.
[27:58.880 --> 28:03.040]  Yet on the other hand, the top of drugs you'll see today, U.S. Small Business Optimism Index
[28:03.040 --> 28:05.440]  surges by the most since 1980.
[28:05.440 --> 28:10.880]  The National Federation of Independent Business looked at this and they said, this is a jump
[28:10.880 --> 28:18.960]  of 7.4 points in just the last month, the highest since the end of 2004 from 98.4.
[28:18.960 --> 28:24.600]  They said, this is the most confident small business has been since 1980, why?
[28:24.600 --> 28:30.600]  Because we got somebody that understands that the government doesn't create jobs.
[28:30.600 --> 28:33.760]  I mean, Donald Trump has run businesses his entire life.
[28:33.760 --> 28:34.760]  He's a businessman.
[28:34.760 --> 28:38.680]  And that's one of the things that is really key is we look at these lines of attack that
[28:38.680 --> 28:40.240]  are coming up with conflict of interest.
[28:40.240 --> 28:43.960]  We don't want to have people who have been politicians all their life, who have been
[28:43.960 --> 28:47.360]  lawyers all their life, who have been community organizers all their life.
[28:47.360 --> 28:49.520]  Those people are going to regulate you to death.
[28:49.520 --> 28:52.840]  That's all they know is laws and rules.
[28:52.840 --> 28:54.320]  They never think about the consequences.
[28:54.320 --> 28:56.400]  They never pay any attention to the consequences.
[28:56.400 --> 29:01.960]  So we now have somebody who knows what it's like to be regulated to death.
[29:01.960 --> 29:03.960]  They know the struggles that everybody has.
[29:03.960 --> 29:04.960]  He's spoken to it.
[29:04.960 --> 29:08.800]  And I think he truly does understand that and is going to do something about it and
[29:08.800 --> 29:09.800]  everybody else does.
[29:09.800 --> 29:13.680]  That's why we have such high consumer confidence, that's why we have such high confidence from
[29:13.680 --> 29:18.160]  small businesses because it's small businesses that bear the brunt of the regulations.
[29:18.160 --> 29:21.920]  As a matter of fact, it's usually the big business and it's usually the established
[29:21.920 --> 29:26.640]  businesses that are screaming for regulation because they want to keep small competitors
[29:26.640 --> 29:29.360]  who might be disruptive, who might do a better job than them.
[29:29.360 --> 29:31.520]  They want to keep them out of the market.
[29:31.520 --> 29:35.960]  They want to saw off the bottom rungs of a ladder of success.
[29:35.960 --> 29:40.760]  That's a whole point of most regulations, especially at the state and local level.
[29:40.760 --> 29:44.600]  Now, we're going to be right back in just a moment and we're going to have Alex Jones
[29:44.600 --> 29:46.760]  talking about the attack on the press.
[29:46.760 --> 29:49.680]  Stay with us.
[29:49.680 --> 29:50.960]  We're on the march.
[29:50.960 --> 29:53.400]  The Empire's on the run.
[29:53.400 --> 30:18.520]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:18.520 --> 30:43.200]  We're going to be right back in just a moment and we're going to have Alex Jones talking
[30:43.200 --> 30:45.880]  about the attack on the press.
[30:45.880 --> 30:49.040]  Einstein asked Sessions if he would respect that decision.
[30:49.040 --> 30:52.200]  Sessions said he disagreed with the law, but respects it as law.
[30:52.200 --> 30:54.400]  So Jeff Sessions will be the Attorney General.
[30:54.400 --> 30:56.400]  The protests have failed again.
[30:56.400 --> 30:58.400]  This is Owen Schreuer for Infowars.com.
[30:58.400 --> 31:03.840]  Over the years, there have been a lot of powerful advancements in the field of science and

[32:55.560 --> 33:21.200]  Rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty, you're listening to the Alex Jones
[33:21.200 --> 33:27.360]  show.
[33:27.360 --> 33:34.720]  The last few months I have made the point at Nauseam that when you have mainstream dying
[33:34.720 --> 33:44.360]  dinosaur media and basically the entire executive branch hijacked by the Democratic Party in
[33:44.360 --> 33:52.200]  offshore interest, running around constantly claiming that the Russians are the reason
[33:52.200 --> 34:00.400]  the public hates them so much, and signing legislation to put the CIA over the board
[34:00.400 --> 34:07.000]  of governors of the Federal Communications Commission, you know you're in a very, very
[34:07.000 --> 34:10.000]  dangerous climate for the First Amendment.
[34:10.000 --> 34:15.960]  Now we've seen unprecedented persecution of the press under Obama, hands down the worst
[34:15.960 --> 34:17.200]  president ever.
[34:17.200 --> 34:24.200]  That's why I was so rich to see my little strip come out and say that there was this
[34:24.200 --> 34:27.840]  persecution of the press by Donald Trump with no evidence because he, quote, made fun of
[34:27.840 --> 34:28.840]  somebody.
[34:28.840 --> 34:34.640]  Well, that's called his First Amendment, Mrs. Streep.
[34:34.640 --> 34:40.800]  But now we see a Business Insider article asking why is Drudge Report under attack and
[34:40.800 --> 34:49.480]  who is behind it, and pointing out that since late December the site has been up and down,
[34:49.480 --> 34:53.960]  and the Drudge himself has come out and said it's the biggest DDoS attack in its 20-plus
[34:53.960 --> 34:54.960]  year history.
[34:54.960 --> 35:02.160]  Now notice that follows on the heels of a few weeks before that when we had the biggest
[35:02.160 --> 35:09.560]  DDoS attack of our history that is still, by the way, ongoing, intermittently.
[35:09.560 --> 35:16.920]  And we have one of the companies that represents the top credit card companies, Walmart, you
[35:16.920 --> 35:17.920]  name it.
[35:17.920 --> 35:20.480]  There are three top companies.
[35:20.480 --> 35:26.000]  We have one of them signed as a contract for years and another as a consultant.
[35:26.000 --> 35:33.600]  And they said that the attack we're under is the second biggest they've ever seen.
[35:33.600 --> 35:38.600]  And when they say that they've ever seen, they mean in the history of the Internet and
[35:38.600 --> 35:40.240]  what is known to be dealt with.
[35:40.240 --> 35:46.160]  What's happened to us is being studied by the FBI, you name it, because it was so many
[35:46.160 --> 35:50.640]  attacks, not just one and not just one type of attack.
[35:50.640 --> 35:55.280]  So when you see press reports weeks after Drudge has been under attack, still asking
[35:55.280 --> 36:01.560]  what's going on, it's been announced.
[36:01.560 --> 36:06.720]  They're saying they're going to, quote, attack Russian assets and Russian media and Russian
[36:06.720 --> 36:13.200]  ally media with cyber attacks and, quote, other measures at the time they're choosing.
[36:13.200 --> 36:16.280]  We've heard this from Obama.
[36:16.280 --> 36:17.840]  We've heard this from Hillary.
[36:17.840 --> 36:20.160]  We've heard this from McCain.
[36:20.160 --> 36:21.160]  We've heard this.
[36:21.160 --> 36:23.360]  And of course, it's asinine when you're an American patriot.
[36:23.360 --> 36:27.840]  Have nothing to do with Russia to sit here and watch this, but nevertheless, it's real.
[36:27.840 --> 36:33.800]  All they need is the political cover in Congress and at the Pentagon to give the orders out
[36:33.800 --> 36:34.800]  to do this.
[36:34.800 --> 36:37.480]  They can also farm it out.
[36:37.480 --> 36:42.760]  And we know that they farmed out to foreign, different multinational PR firms.
[36:42.760 --> 36:47.400]  They are different bots during the election to go out and attack the free press as well
[36:47.400 --> 36:48.640]  to go out and attack Donald Trump.
[36:48.640 --> 36:51.800]  In fact, Donald Trump's been under massive attacks, so I'm just going to leave it at
[36:51.800 --> 36:52.800]  that.
[36:52.800 --> 36:55.880]  Donald Trump, I heard that from the companies we work with.
[36:55.880 --> 36:59.840]  They said the ones that we run were even bigger and that's because, again, these are just
[36:59.840 --> 37:03.480]  getting bigger historically.
[37:03.480 --> 37:06.240]  They're exponentially getting bigger with whoever gets hit by them.
[37:06.240 --> 37:12.080]  And that's why Drugs, who's never, you know, called out for help or never called out to
[37:12.080 --> 37:17.840]  point out something's happening, has been coming out is because it's unprecedented
[37:17.840 --> 37:19.720]  and he is under attack.
[37:19.720 --> 37:25.760]  And isn't it funny about 14 months ago, he came to Austin, Texas, isn't it interesting
[37:25.760 --> 37:30.400]  and said next year, that was 2016, they're coming out of the free speech.
[37:30.400 --> 37:32.200]  That's the year it all happens.
[37:32.200 --> 37:37.000]  He'd been told by Supreme Court Justice, the other conservative one that didn't mysteriously
[37:37.000 --> 37:38.520]  die.
[37:38.520 --> 37:40.880]  So this country is in a battle for its future.
[37:40.880 --> 37:41.880]  Everybody knows that.
[37:41.880 --> 37:43.760]  He's not hiding under a rock somewhere.
[37:43.760 --> 37:48.160]  But I just want to point out that this is a very, very serious time to be alive and
[37:48.160 --> 37:51.440]  that everyone should not take free speech for granted.
[37:51.440 --> 37:55.560]  Now, our sources said this had to be state actors.
[37:55.560 --> 38:00.520]  A lot of the DDoS attack type systems we were under of this magnitude have been from the
[38:00.520 --> 38:05.960]  communist Chinese in the past, what, four months ago, the communist Chinese, and again,
[38:05.960 --> 38:10.680]  two months ago, took credit for massive DDoS attacks all over the United States.
[38:10.680 --> 38:13.680]  So this appears to be something that comes out of them.
[38:13.680 --> 38:19.080]  But when Drudge says, looks like U.S. government or elements of it, they clearly have started
[38:19.080 --> 38:24.680]  to work with the Chinese sometimes or green lighted these types of attacks that happened
[38:24.680 --> 38:27.200]  against the American people.
[38:27.200 --> 38:29.920]  So Drudge seems to think it's the U.S. government.
[38:29.920 --> 38:33.560]  They've announced that that's what they're doing to a certain extent and the Chinese
[38:33.560 --> 38:37.600]  are involved in unprecedented attacks.
[38:37.600 --> 38:44.640]  But the real reason I get to all this is we're witnessing a declared war against the
[38:44.640 --> 38:47.480]  press and against free speech in America.
[38:47.480 --> 38:49.600]  That's undeniable.
[38:49.600 --> 38:55.880]  And so to conservatives and liberals and just people who support free speech period, everyone
[38:55.880 --> 38:58.360]  should be extremely vocal and upset right now.
[38:58.360 --> 38:59.360]  This is a big deal.
[38:59.360 --> 39:03.680]  You know, when they arrested the next to Susan, the filmmaker on Trump top charges years
[39:03.680 --> 39:05.680]  ago, I said, this is wrong.
[39:05.680 --> 39:06.680]  This is a bellwether.
[39:06.680 --> 39:08.560]  This is a sign for other people.
[39:08.560 --> 39:10.400]  This is a canary in the coal mine.
[39:10.400 --> 39:12.760]  And they said, oh, you're, you know, you conservatives are just upset.
[39:12.760 --> 39:13.760]  We're going to arrest you.
[39:13.760 --> 39:17.280]  No, I'd be upset if somebody arrested Michael Moore for his speech.
[39:17.280 --> 39:18.280]  Okay.
[39:18.280 --> 39:20.840]  And I don't like Michael Moore and I don't agree with much of what he has to say.
[39:20.840 --> 39:23.000]  This is really common sense, folks.
[39:23.000 --> 39:29.480]  This is so draconian, so authoritarian, and we really see the devolution, the falling
[39:29.480 --> 39:34.840]  apart of the so-called left from always having issues to now having no moral high ground whatsoever
[39:34.840 --> 39:44.960]  and to really be a pathetic, but quite frankly, frightening group of delusional anti-freedom
[39:44.960 --> 39:47.160]  cult members.
[39:47.160 --> 39:53.400]  Now that said, I'm going to go ahead and lay out something here and I'm just going to
[39:53.400 --> 39:59.880]  leave it at that, but I need to put this out just in general for everybody's safety.
[39:59.880 --> 40:08.720]  I have been made aware of information dealing with this operation against the press in this
[40:08.720 --> 40:15.000]  country that goes far beyond cyber attacks.
[40:15.000 --> 40:20.720]  And so everybody just needs to understand that in my 20 plus years on air, this is the
[40:20.720 --> 40:25.720]  most dangerous escalation I've ever heard of.
[40:25.720 --> 40:34.920]  Now we all remember the DNC staffer who got shot four times in the back and his mother's
[40:34.920 --> 40:39.680]  gone public, his lawyer's gone public, in fact, we've had his lawyer on, and I've talked
[40:39.680 --> 40:44.160]  about the fact that there's evidence of foul play, well, obviously there's foul play, but
[40:44.160 --> 40:51.760]  evidence of the foul play linking to the Democrats and an ongoing cover up, we've had on top
[40:51.760 --> 40:59.880]  of it, Julian Assange come out and basically imply that Seth Rich is his source or at least
[40:59.880 --> 41:02.600]  one of his sources.
[41:02.600 --> 41:07.440]  The information I have ties into that general area, and I'm just going to stop right there,
[41:07.440 --> 41:13.440]  but I'm going to tell you that it obviously affects all of us, all of us.
[41:13.440 --> 41:14.440]  Let me just be clear.
[41:14.440 --> 41:20.560]  When I say that, I mean all of us that are on the front lines of this situation need
[41:20.560 --> 41:25.400]  to understand that things have moved into a whole another ball game level and that Hillary
[41:25.400 --> 41:29.760]  and the globalists have taken their gloves off.
[41:29.760 --> 41:34.000]  They're that evil, they're that arrogant, they're that crazy, listen, look how sick
[41:34.000 --> 41:39.440]  and clearly nuts Hillary was, but still she thought that she could run as a corpse just
[41:39.440 --> 41:42.120]  like Jeb Bush thought.
[41:42.120 --> 41:48.000]  So their greatest weakness is also their greatest strength because bravada arrogance can take
[41:48.000 --> 41:52.960]  you sometimes over the line of defeat or victory.
[41:52.960 --> 41:57.800]  And folks know that we break a lot of big news here, people know that I don't just say
[41:57.800 --> 42:05.760]  things here on air and I have been admonished not to say anything, so I'm not going to,
[42:05.760 --> 42:12.280]  I should be able to soon give you the information and I'm kind of just putting the big information
[42:12.280 --> 42:18.240]  into this larger report because that just feels best, a little Easter egg there for
[42:18.240 --> 42:24.760]  you with information, that quite frankly is a selfish Easter egg because I just really
[42:24.760 --> 42:28.520]  wish we could bring sunshine to this whole situation and turn this country and this world
[42:28.520 --> 42:29.520]  around.
[42:29.520 --> 42:33.000]  I mean my God, the Democrats and Republican leadership are trying to start wars, they're
[42:33.000 --> 42:38.200]  behind radical Islam publicly, they're engaged in such deception in the media, they're just
[42:38.200 --> 42:45.200]  horrible, evil, wicked people like out of a cartoon, I mean they're so bad, it's hard
[42:45.200 --> 42:46.200]  to believe.
[42:46.200 --> 42:51.040]  You study history, there's always every generation totally crazy, whacked out, super evil people
[42:51.040 --> 42:56.480]  that are into badness and into hurting people and into just overthrowing beauty and goodness.
[42:56.480 --> 43:01.000]  So that's just the way it always works, that's up to us to stop them, but boy let me tell
[43:01.000 --> 43:10.760]  you, I cannot wait to give you all this information and I guess it's a good thing, I'm on the
[43:10.760 --> 43:19.000]  road, I just wish, I just don't bear it by nose how real all this is because it has gone
[43:19.000 --> 43:24.640]  to a whole other level and these people can see the end of their days because of their
[43:24.640 --> 43:32.080]  own crimes, but they just hate all of us that are seen at the forefront of bringing their
[43:32.080 --> 43:33.480]  reign of terror to an end.
[43:33.480 --> 43:37.880]  Alright, that's my report, I'm going to have more of these fall throughout the day, I'm
[43:37.880 --> 43:42.760]  Alex Jones from FullWars.com, please don't take this broadcast for granted, please pray
[43:42.760 --> 43:47.320]  for us and please support the broadcast and spread the word because I don't want to fight
[43:47.320 --> 43:51.800]  and have this all in vain, but regardless of what happens to us individually in this
[43:51.800 --> 43:56.040]  fight, humanity will prevail, that's God's promise and so I want to thank you all and
[43:56.040 --> 44:02.120]  just say I really appreciate you all and I want to thank you for your prayers and support.
[44:02.120 --> 44:05.600]  We know what's happened to drugs, he's under attack like everybody else, it's part of the
[44:05.600 --> 44:10.680]  testing, the end of free speech, it's part of the censorship being announced everywhere
[44:10.680 --> 44:15.320]  both governmental and corporates, it's part of the enemy that sees control of this country
[44:15.320 --> 44:22.640]  and much of the world, trying to maintain control, it's modern war, Pentagon called
[44:22.640 --> 44:28.760]  the Cold War World War 3, well this is the new 21st century world war folks, it's economic,
[44:28.760 --> 44:35.520]  it's cultural, it's using borders, it's using refugees, it's using jihadis, it's using
[44:35.520 --> 44:40.280]  attacks on the family and a lot of people have chosen to serve evil, a lot of people
[44:40.280 --> 44:47.280]  have picked the wrong team. And again that's Alex Jones, he's taking
[44:47.280 --> 44:51.640]  a well-deserved vacation, but even when he's on vacation he doesn't take a vacation because
[44:51.640 --> 44:55.200]  the events of the day are so compelling and of course one of the key things that's happening
[44:55.200 --> 44:59.760]  today is the beginning of the confirmation hearings, we're less than 10 days out from
[44:59.760 --> 45:05.160]  Trump's inauguration and so the confirmation hearings have begun, Jeff Sessions fittingly
[45:05.160 --> 45:10.880]  enough is the first person to go before the Senate and I say fittingly enough because
[45:10.880 --> 45:14.920]  he was the first person to stand up and support Donald Trump, only time he's ever endorsed
[45:14.920 --> 45:18.640]  anybody in his entire political career for president he endorsed Donald Trump and has
[45:18.640 --> 45:23.920]  been a very important factor in educating not only Donald Trump but the American public
[45:23.920 --> 45:28.520]  about the dangers of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, it's not simply a trade agreement, it was
[45:28.520 --> 45:33.600]  a massive grab against our national sovereignty setting up a multinational committee body
[45:33.600 --> 45:38.440]  that was going to be able to change at will that document, add whoever they wished, it
[45:38.440 --> 45:45.120]  was sold as a move against China, well they could have added China on day one to that
[45:45.120 --> 45:49.400]  if they wished, they could decide which industries and which countries were going to be rewarded
[45:49.400 --> 45:55.520]  and which ones were going to be punished. And so that was a massive, massive move towards
[45:55.520 --> 46:02.120]  globalism removing our sovereignty, removing any say over our own destiny that we might
[46:02.120 --> 46:07.920]  have so it was a very good thing that he explained that to the public even though the Senate
[46:07.920 --> 46:12.440]  would not listen to him. Now today the Wall Street Journal points out that as they're
[46:12.440 --> 46:18.760]  criticizing him over some hearings that he had decades ago where he was criticized of
[46:18.760 --> 46:23.520]  some civil rights issues, Senator Arlen Spector of Pennsylvania said the only vote that he
[46:23.520 --> 46:28.280]  regretted from his decades in Congress was his vote against confirming Mr. Sessions as
[46:28.280 --> 46:33.680]  a federal judge in 1986 because he had since found him to be egalitarian he said and I
[46:33.680 --> 46:39.080]  guess you know Arlen Spector he was the guy that put forward the magic bullet theory for
[46:39.080 --> 46:45.520]  the JFK commission, I guess he didn't regret doing that putting out that bit of fanciful
[46:45.520 --> 46:51.520]  farce for everybody but still over time people have come to understand who Senator Sessions
[46:51.520 --> 46:57.520]  is except for Cory Booker, well Cory Booker knows who he is okay, Cory Booker will testify
[46:57.520 --> 47:01.960]  against the deeply troubling political views he says of Senator Sessions he says he's
[47:01.960 --> 47:07.040]  repeatedly stood in the way of efforts to promote and protect Americans civil rights.
[47:07.040 --> 47:11.520]  Well that was actually a quote from Senator Patrick Leahy who previously said that Sessions
[47:11.520 --> 47:16.320]  was wonderful to work with. See these guys this is nothing folks but politics that they're
[47:16.320 --> 47:20.600]  putting out here and Sessions says you know who I am you know what I believe and then
[47:20.600 --> 47:23.600]  he came out and said this about law enforcement this is one of the reasons why so many law
[47:23.600 --> 47:27.840]  enforcement organizations like Sessions he said law enforcement as a whole has been
[47:27.840 --> 47:34.440]  unfairly maligned and blamed for the unacceptable actions of a few bad actors they believe the
[47:34.440 --> 47:38.440]  political leadership of this country has abandoned them I think that's a fair characterization
[47:38.440 --> 47:43.800]  of what we've seen of course we've seen some outrageous things from the police in certain
[47:43.800 --> 47:48.400]  areas we've also seen some reports of things that look very outrageous that when all the
[47:48.400 --> 47:54.400]  evidence came in the police were exonerated but the problem is is that when we have this
[47:54.400 --> 47:59.200]  overreach that has been encouraged by Barack Obama and others the true people that need
[47:59.200 --> 48:03.000]  to be purged from the system are not purged from the system and so that kind of injustice
[48:03.000 --> 48:09.800]  remains you know we had Frank Serpico who talked about corruption in New York City and
[48:09.800 --> 48:14.000]  he said look any organization that you have any organization that you have is filled
[48:14.000 --> 48:17.320]  with people you're gonna have good people you're gonna have bad people and so the question
[48:17.320 --> 48:21.880]  is is the organization gonna become better or worse over the period of time and it becomes
[48:21.880 --> 48:26.200]  better or worse depending on whether you tolerate the bad actors that are in your system or whether
[48:26.200 --> 48:32.760]  you purge them now what Barack Obama and Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch have done is they
[48:32.760 --> 48:40.440]  have demonized all law enforcement categorically because they win by a divide and conquer strategy
[48:40.440 --> 48:46.160]  they see everybody as groups and so Cory Booker is coming out and he tells roll call
[48:46.160 --> 48:52.840]  which is a insider publication of Capitol Hill he actually came out to them and said
[48:52.840 --> 48:58.960]  we've done the research and we can't find any other example of a senator testifying
[48:58.960 --> 49:02.360]  against a fellow senator in his confirmation hearings we're gonna be the first ones to
[49:02.360 --> 49:07.280]  do that and they point out in the very first paragraph they say this is a move that could
[49:07.280 --> 49:13.640]  firm up Booker's progressive bona fides ahead of a possible 2020 presidential bid yeah because
[49:13.640 --> 49:18.680]  you come out and you play the race card in an unprincipled way that makes you the beloved
[49:18.680 --> 49:23.720]  representative of the left now I want to play what Rudy Giuliani who knows Jeff sessions
[49:23.720 --> 49:31.400]  said here's a clip of Rudy Giuliani Jeff sessions for 30 years this man is a completely honest
[49:31.400 --> 49:35.640]  prosecutor every one of those senators knows he's not a racist and they play in a game
[49:35.640 --> 49:42.360]  the one the ones who come up there and and do that are really being intellectually dishonest
[49:42.360 --> 49:48.160]  it is exactly what this is it's intellectual dishonesty it is playing a political game
[49:48.160 --> 49:53.760]  it is doing it for his own personal political advantage we should remember what Cory Booker
[49:53.760 --> 49:58.640]  did and we should hold him to this when he runs for president in four years I guarantee
[49:58.640 --> 50:02.800]  you that he's gonna run for president in four years out of all the speakers that were at
[50:02.800 --> 50:06.640]  the DNC and I was there covering that for info wars he was by far I thought the most
[50:06.640 --> 50:13.640]  charismatic speaker and now he has shown that he has absolutely no moral integrity he is
[50:13.640 --> 50:19.200]  an unprincipled opportunist and that's exactly what the left is looking for especially if
[50:19.200 --> 50:23.200]  you'll play the race card you see when people come out and they're constantly breaking people
[50:23.200 --> 50:28.520]  into groups I think that is exactly the kind of leader that we don't want isn't that what
[50:28.520 --> 50:32.520]  they complained about with Donald Trump and yet Donald Trump was not doing that Donald
[50:32.520 --> 50:36.960]  Trump when he talked about the situations that we had at the border when he talked about
[50:36.960 --> 50:43.440]  how we had criminals that were being allowed to stay we've now seen that but down in writing
[50:43.440 --> 50:48.480]  we've had these amnesty groups in California say let's hide the foreign citizens who are
[50:48.480 --> 50:53.440]  gang members here illegally in California let's hide those lists from Donald Trump because
[50:53.440 --> 50:57.920]  he might deport them we don't want them deported we want them to stay here they said stay with
[50:57.920 --> 51:04.240]  us we'll be right back you ever wonder what happened to America because of what we did

[56:16.720 --> 56:22.840]  at info wars life dot com that's bio truce selenium now there's an article on life set
[56:22.840 --> 56:29.480]  pointing out democrats look to be helpless as sessions heads to the hill here's why they're
[56:29.480 --> 56:34.400]  most likely going to be helpless let's play this video they invoke what's known as the
[56:34.400 --> 56:40.280]  nuclear option it kills the republican threat of a filibuster on most presidential appointments
[56:40.280 --> 56:44.920]  with the bigger message behind the movies clear democrats and this president going to war
[56:44.920 --> 56:48.720]  with their enemies finally this is a move democrats had to make republicans put them
[56:48.720 --> 56:51.720]  in a position where basically republicans were saying we are not going to honor the
[56:51.720 --> 56:57.040]  power of the president all this really does is say that the president that we elected
[56:57.040 --> 57:01.360]  to actually run the government gets to run the government once the majority is blocked
[57:01.360 --> 57:05.840]  all the time on relatively ordinary things it's not going to tolerate the protection
[57:05.840 --> 57:12.400]  of the minority head crews is sort of exhibit a for a why the democrats and why harry reid
[57:12.400 --> 57:17.480]  did what they had to do what we had in the senate which likes to call itself the world's
[57:17.480 --> 57:22.640]  greatest deliberative body we had paralysis instead I think the escalated use of the filibuster
[57:22.640 --> 57:26.920]  is more or less made it obsolete on the other hand the actual history of how the filibuster
[57:26.920 --> 57:31.120]  is used is mostly nasty ugly and racist I don't see what other political options there
[57:31.120 --> 57:37.240]  are what other procedural options there are so deciding to allow majority rules to incrementally
[57:37.240 --> 57:44.000]  increase governmental efficiency and presidential appointments is so unthinkably extreme it's
[57:44.000 --> 57:49.440]  the nuclear option they are presenting the picture to the american people that the united
[57:49.440 --> 57:54.360]  states senate was running as smoothly as it possibly could right and the united states
[57:54.360 --> 58:00.280]  senate was in fact paralyzed john mccain said there are now no rules in the senate no rules
[58:00.280 --> 58:06.360]  actually now majority rules you know almost like a democracy I think frankly ray it's
[58:06.360 --> 58:13.240]  long overdue even just the reaction to this announcement seems to be one more piece of
[58:13.240 --> 58:19.280]  evidence that you know this republican party is not interested in doing the business of
[58:19.280 --> 58:26.520]  the country that's from the washington for the rest well sure there's no question that
[58:26.520 --> 58:33.480]  we could come one day to regret this yeah well that was 2013 now the day that they're
[58:33.480 --> 58:39.480]  going to regret this is 2017 because all this talk about majority rule yeah they're gonna
[58:39.480 --> 58:42.800]  get it they're gonna get it good and hard stay with us we'll be right back with roger
[58:42.800 --> 58:49.800]  stone joining us in the next hour to break this down further
[59:13.800 --> 59:19.040]  we've brought out a lot of amazing products like survival shield x2 super male vitality
[59:19.040 --> 59:23.920]  of so many others with its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process
[59:23.920 --> 59:29.280]  designed for maximized effects this formula is the platinum standard of multi vitamin
[59:29.280 --> 59:35.080]  mineral products and this part is most important the ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are
[59:35.080 --> 59:41.120]  either plant derived or of the highest quality lab standard that means it's clean that means
[59:41.120 --> 59:45.080]  it's pure and rest secured you're finding the tip of the spear in the info war that's info
[59:45.080 --> 59:52.720]  wars life dot com and vitamin mineral fusion take action now before we sell out you're
[59:52.720 --> 1:00:17.760]  listening to the alex jones show before america can be great again she must be free again you're
[1:00:17.760 --> 1:00:27.840]  listening to the alex jones show welcome to the alex jones show i'm david night in the
[1:00:27.840 --> 1:00:31.280]  next segment we have roger stone join us to talk about the confirmation hearings that
[1:00:31.280 --> 1:00:38.640]  have begun with jeff sessions and you just heard in that last clip the democrats crowing
[1:00:38.640 --> 1:00:42.560]  about the fact hey we got the power we're going to use we're going to shut down filibusters
[1:00:42.560 --> 1:00:45.760]  and we're going to go with a simple majority vote well now they're going to get a simple
[1:00:45.760 --> 1:00:51.720]  majority vote and up or down and as they say democrats are helpless as sessions is heading
[1:00:51.720 --> 1:00:57.280]  to the hill that's a life set story you know they may not be able to stop them but that's
[1:00:57.280 --> 1:01:03.400]  not what this is about this is about them grandstanding for their audience it's about their
[1:01:03.400 --> 1:01:10.520]  posturing for their political tribe because that's exactly what core booker is doing and
[1:01:10.520 --> 1:01:15.400]  the rest of these people like pat lehi they know better they're just being very dishonest
[1:01:15.400 --> 1:01:20.720]  very political trying to endear themselves to the choir that they preach to so we're
[1:01:20.720 --> 1:01:23.520]  going to go to that news when we come back from the break in a course on the third hour
[1:01:23.520 --> 1:01:30.360]  we're going to be talking to the man who invented email which led to hillary's downfall thanks
[1:01:30.360 --> 1:01:37.400]  our debt of gratitude for him but he also is a biologist phd biologist from mit and
[1:01:37.400 --> 1:01:42.600]  he discovered some very troubling things about genetically modified food sources and he's
[1:01:42.600 --> 1:01:46.760]  going to break that down for us as well and there's a connection between those two they
[1:01:46.760 --> 1:01:52.840]  are not completely disconnected and he's going to tell us how his struggles to make sure
[1:01:52.840 --> 1:01:58.800]  that they didn't deny him being the person who had invented email he's going to talk
[1:01:58.800 --> 1:02:03.240]  to us about that because it's all related to the military industrial complex just like
[1:02:03.240 --> 1:02:06.560]  so many of these technological inventions are they want to take credit for everything
[1:02:06.560 --> 1:02:11.240]  that is good and of course they're sliding a lot of stuff under the mat that isn't good
[1:02:11.240 --> 1:02:15.400]  now as we look at the influence of technology on our lives i thought this is kind of interesting
[1:02:15.400 --> 1:02:20.360]  you may not have realized this but the marshal islands have been offline since the end of
[1:02:20.360 --> 1:02:25.800]  december they've gone the entire year so far in 2017 without the internet now some of you
[1:02:25.800 --> 1:02:29.540]  might think that's a good thing if it keeps them off of facebook they say an internet
[1:02:29.540 --> 1:02:34.760]  blackout in the marshal islands has caused widespread symptoms of withdrawal and a population
[1:02:34.760 --> 1:02:38.680]  that's used to fast internet speed the interesting thing about this they got underwater cable
[1:02:38.680 --> 1:02:43.040]  put in by the u.s. military i wonder what the military is using they say they've reverted
[1:02:43.040 --> 1:02:47.080]  to a satellite backup they're only getting 3% of the bandwidth which means that they're
[1:02:47.080 --> 1:02:53.680]  having to ration internet usage between businesses and customers and government customers on
[1:02:53.680 --> 1:03:01.040]  a rotating basis people have given up social media on a cold turkey basis and so they say
[1:03:01.040 --> 1:03:04.200]  that they think they're going to get it back but that's very difficult for them to find
[1:03:04.200 --> 1:03:10.080]  where the problem is they said it's like finding a pen prick on a three mile stretch of fiber
[1:03:10.080 --> 1:03:17.160]  optic cable you often don't and here's what's interesting about this you never think about
[1:03:17.160 --> 1:03:21.400]  how fragile our infrastructure is until you see something like this that's why i brought
[1:03:21.400 --> 1:03:25.600]  it up doesn't affect most people most people don't didn't realize that the marshal islands
[1:03:25.600 --> 1:03:29.040]  have been offline for for 10 days or whatever except for the people in the marshal islands
[1:03:29.040 --> 1:03:35.360]  but the more complex our society becomes the more easy it is for us to have catastrophic
[1:03:35.360 --> 1:03:40.640]  disruptions and when you start to think about what they're laying out here is they connect
[1:03:40.640 --> 1:03:45.440]  everything together with the internet of things of course that creates surveillance and privacy
[1:03:45.440 --> 1:03:51.360]  issues we have cars that are now being put on an information highway that is actually
[1:03:51.360 --> 1:03:54.480]  going to be used to spy on you it's going to be used to tax you it's going to be used
[1:03:54.480 --> 1:04:00.400]  to track you but the other part of this is that it's also creating a very high tech very
[1:04:00.400 --> 1:04:08.960]  fragile infrastructure and when you put all your cars on a self-driving basis then you're
[1:04:08.960 --> 1:04:12.920]  going to have a situation where you can have something like this very easily happen and
[1:04:12.920 --> 1:04:16.360]  here they've gone 10 days and they can't find where the break is on the cable seems to me
[1:04:16.360 --> 1:04:20.640]  like they could have replaced the three mile stretch of cable in that amount of time i
[1:04:20.640 --> 1:04:25.240]  don't know what the technical issues are on that but of course as we look at the self
[1:04:25.240 --> 1:04:29.600]  driving issue there's a story up on drudge report talking about the end of car ownership
[1:04:29.600 --> 1:04:34.200]  of course it is that's what they've been talking about for a long time the corporations are
[1:04:34.200 --> 1:04:40.200]  seeking to rent to you the government wants to tax and track everything that you have
[1:04:40.200 --> 1:04:46.680]  and so that's why they're pushing this on it is also an issue we need to think about
[1:04:46.680 --> 1:04:50.960]  not only about our freedom many people look at this as just transportation versus recreation
[1:04:50.960 --> 1:04:55.160]  knows really about your freedom and your independence stay with us we come back when we're talking
[1:04:55.160 --> 1:05:02.200]  to roger stone about the confirmation hearings we write back here is michelle obama in 2008
[1:05:02.200 --> 1:05:08.360]  after her husband was elected what we've learned over this year is that hope is making a comeback
[1:05:08.360 --> 1:05:15.800]  it is making a comeback and let me tell you something for the first time in my adult lifetime
[1:05:15.800 --> 1:05:21.720]  i'm really proud of my country here she is in 2016 as her husband is leaving office now
[1:05:21.720 --> 1:05:28.400]  we're feeling what not having hope feels like you know i love this according to michelle
[1:05:28.400 --> 1:05:33.360]  obama we had hope in 2008 then her husband was in charge for eight years now here in
[1:05:33.360 --> 1:05:40.040]  2017 we have no hope so according to her barrage legacy is the killer of hope well thank god
[1:05:40.040 --> 1:05:44.680]  real americans are finally feeling hope with donald trump the last bastion of real hope
[1:05:44.680 --> 1:05:50.280]  not just a catchphrase and taking this country back from the no hope obamas so obama's legacy
[1:05:50.280 --> 1:06:15.040]  is no hope and donald trump this is owin schreuer for info wars dot com we have the new products

[1:08:21.720 --> 1:08:27.800]  to be joining us in a moment the lead up to the trump administration is beginning and
[1:08:27.800 --> 1:08:34.040]  now the hearings on capitol hill are beginning on his nominations that he's put for cabinet
[1:08:34.040 --> 1:08:39.760]  the first one up is jeff sessions when talking to roger stone about what he sees coming up
[1:08:39.760 --> 1:08:43.720]  as the hill points out these are going to be coming thick and fast there's not much
[1:08:43.720 --> 1:08:48.880]  time we've only got about 10 days or so before donald trump is inaugurated and they say that
[1:08:48.880 --> 1:08:53.080]  of course tonight we're going to have the farewell address from barack obama he's going
[1:08:53.080 --> 1:08:57.960]  back to chicago usually the president gives a farewell address in washington and then
[1:08:57.960 --> 1:09:02.400]  goes home but see obama isn't going to go home he's going to stay in washington so he's
[1:09:02.400 --> 1:09:07.640]  going to go to his old home and talk about how great the last eight years have been and
[1:09:07.640 --> 1:09:14.160]  the city that has had on his last eight years about the same number of people shot and killed
[1:09:14.160 --> 1:09:21.680]  in chicago as americans who died in iraq under george w bush that's his accomplishment and
[1:09:21.680 --> 1:09:27.280]  that's just domestic war okay but the black people and the police at war with each other
[1:09:27.280 --> 1:09:31.400]  he's put blacks at war with whites with each other he's created this kind of unrest here
[1:09:31.400 --> 1:09:38.080]  at home he has authorized indefinite detention without trial he's just authorized the state
[1:09:38.080 --> 1:09:44.160]  department being used as a propaganda master a ministry of truth giving them 160 million
[1:09:44.160 --> 1:09:48.800]  dollars over two years to vet what's true and what isn't and of course he's been joined
[1:09:48.800 --> 1:09:54.240]  in all of this by the people like john mccain and lindsay graham those political hacks of
[1:09:54.240 --> 1:09:58.960]  the military industrial complex they've been there right alongside him with all these and
[1:09:58.960 --> 1:10:03.360]  with all these foreign wars that he's involved and he's kept all the wars of george w bush
[1:10:03.360 --> 1:10:09.000]  he added another three of his own and now we've had a war this nobel peace prize president
[1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:15.240]  that we've got we're not war with seven countries and he has been at war the entire administration
[1:10:15.240 --> 1:10:22.760]  that he has perpetual war it is 1984 folks that is the legacy of barack obama i want
[1:10:22.760 --> 1:10:26.840]  to take a quick look at a couple of news items that have come out here the guardian is pointing
[1:10:26.840 --> 1:10:33.720]  out that there is a trail of slaughter in prisons that is shocking brazilians as they
[1:10:33.720 --> 1:10:39.440]  have gang wars exploding within the prisons and i bring this up because it highlights
[1:10:39.440 --> 1:10:47.040]  the fact that we can't solve many all of our problems in society most of our problems
[1:10:47.040 --> 1:10:52.160]  cannot be solved by adding more law enforcement by adding more prohibition you see people
[1:10:52.160 --> 1:10:57.400]  are still dying of overdoses and drugs and even though the prisons are a gun free zone
[1:10:57.400 --> 1:11:02.440]  because they have prohibited guns for prisoners people are still dying there and they're dying
[1:11:02.440 --> 1:11:09.400]  there and gang wars and at the same time we've got california accusing donald trump of being
[1:11:09.400 --> 1:11:13.720]  a racist because he said we've got to get the criminals that have been allowed into our
[1:11:13.720 --> 1:11:21.640]  country foreign citizens who are here illegally we've got to get these people out of our country
[1:11:21.640 --> 1:11:26.680]  they say oh you're a racist meanwhile california says we're not going to let donald trump look
[1:11:26.680 --> 1:11:32.040]  at the list of gang members that we have compiled in california the people who are foreign citizens
[1:11:32.040 --> 1:11:36.240]  here illegally and violent gang members we're going to keep that from him because we don't
[1:11:36.240 --> 1:11:42.080]  want him to throw them out of the country we're going to go to a report that we've got from
[1:11:42.080 --> 1:11:48.240]  alex jones because glenn back was on tucker carlson's show yesterday a very interesting
[1:11:48.240 --> 1:11:52.120]  report that went back and forth between the two of them of course tucker called him out
[1:11:52.120 --> 1:12:01.240]  on identifying ted cruz as being the messiah but beck denies that that's something we really
[1:12:01.240 --> 1:12:05.240]  can fact check and believe me we will we'll show you the clips of that but let's take
[1:12:05.240 --> 1:12:13.960]  a look at alex's report on tucker carlson's interview with glenn beck all right i am so
[1:12:13.960 --> 1:12:22.200]  sick of looking at glenn beck i am so sick of hearing glenn beck i like tucker carlson
[1:12:22.200 --> 1:12:28.200]  and tucker carlson has the quote big prime time slot on fox news and i think that signifies
[1:12:28.200 --> 1:12:34.480]  the fact that the coup against fox news to put in even more globalist operatives like
[1:12:34.480 --> 1:12:41.840]  bill o'reilly and meghan kelly failed but that said i want nothing to do with fox news
[1:12:41.840 --> 1:12:47.440]  to be clear because they had some vice president once told the new york daily news that i asked
[1:12:47.440 --> 1:12:51.520]  for a job at fox and i didn't get one of that really really makes me mad because they want
[1:12:51.520 --> 1:12:57.480]  to act like they're the emerald castle there were the yellow brick road ends and that i'm
[1:12:57.480 --> 1:13:03.320]  todo and i want to go there no i don't okay i have my own audience it's huge just like
[1:13:03.320 --> 1:13:07.640]  drudge has his own audience i'm trying to build something outside of them we've done
[1:13:07.640 --> 1:13:12.400]  it we've been successful you go to a donald trump rally a third of the shirts are in full
[1:13:12.400 --> 1:13:18.000]  wars dot com and hillary for prison shirts they're not fox news shirts okay we're the
[1:13:18.000 --> 1:13:23.840]  future and i don't say this meanly but your future is selling more catheters and more
[1:13:23.840 --> 1:13:28.400]  diabetic equipment because that's all you've got some very old audience nothing against
[1:13:28.400 --> 1:13:35.040]  them but the point is you're the past we're the future and i know the murdoch's are globalist
[1:13:35.040 --> 1:13:40.960]  and are the scum of the earth and so i understand that i can't ever trust fox news that said
[1:13:40.960 --> 1:13:46.360]  it's a hell of a lot better than say cn or msnbc now that said i go to info wars dot
[1:13:46.360 --> 1:13:50.920]  com this morning and there's a big article up there about the great writer from intel
[1:13:50.920 --> 1:13:55.160]  hub great folks i don't mind it but it still kind of irritates me again it's like oh my
[1:13:55.160 --> 1:14:02.280]  gosh glenn beck says you know half the nation is upset about trump and he hopes that trump
[1:14:02.280 --> 1:14:06.680]  has a good presidency and he can't wait to see how things go this is so sick on many
[1:14:06.680 --> 1:14:14.840]  levels it's like saying uh uh glenn beck said that the grass is green and puppy dogs have
[1:14:14.840 --> 1:14:21.320]  fur and bark and the little pink tongues of course half the country are 47 percent
[1:14:21.320 --> 1:14:25.560]  as brainwashed and hates trump my gosh tell me something i didn't know and then again
[1:14:25.560 --> 1:14:33.760]  what is this failure who's made these apology tours all over abc cbs nbc apologizing for
[1:14:33.760 --> 1:14:39.400]  conservatives apologizing for gun owners apologizing for donald trump trying to sabotage this country
[1:14:39.400 --> 1:14:46.800]  leading an ever trump movement going around being this apologist who quote is an insider
[1:14:46.800 --> 1:14:51.760]  and admits that the liberty movement's really bad and he apologizes to the left a total
[1:14:51.760 --> 1:14:59.720]  judas goat then he goes on fun news and sits up there and acts like he's now pro trump
[1:14:59.720 --> 1:15:05.880]  trying to rehabilitate himself hey mayan kelly at least had the class to leave to nbc knowing
[1:15:05.880 --> 1:15:12.680]  her viewers and listeners hated her guts it's even worse with you beck go away you are
[1:15:12.680 --> 1:15:17.400]  incredible and again i'm not in the competition with you i don't bash other major talk show
[1:15:17.400 --> 1:15:22.400]  host i'm sick of you i know what you've done in talk radio i know what you've done behind
[1:15:22.400 --> 1:15:27.040]  the scenes with sponsors i know how you've been out to get me for like eight years out
[1:15:27.040 --> 1:15:34.360]  to get ron paul out to get donald trump out to get everybody you are bad news in fact
[1:15:34.360 --> 1:15:38.280]  you're so bad news my listeners even get mad at me when i talk about your or or you know
[1:15:38.280 --> 1:15:41.400]  bash you because they don't want to hear about you will believe me i don't want to hear about
[1:15:41.400 --> 1:15:45.800]  him either so here's the deal i don't mind the fact that glenbeck's on info wars right
[1:15:45.800 --> 1:15:51.560]  now because we can have a debate about it but i am sick of this garbage this is out
[1:15:51.560 --> 1:15:56.800]  of control you know i haven't asked to go on tucker carlson because i know better i know
[1:15:56.800 --> 1:16:02.680]  that fox news basically has me banned that's fine i've been banned since i refused to go
[1:16:02.680 --> 1:16:06.760]  up there and be part of pilot tv shows with them i got banned since i refused to go on
[1:16:06.760 --> 1:16:10.120]  their shows and would send surrogates and i was doing i was sending surrogates to fox
[1:16:10.120 --> 1:16:17.440]  news 10 years ago 10 years ago on mancow show and others i want to point out i don't want
[1:16:17.440 --> 1:16:24.000]  fox news but what's crazy is did i get divided on even to say no no would i go on carlson
[1:16:24.000 --> 1:16:31.920]  show sure the point is what is this guy this has been phony super fraud doing on tucker
[1:16:31.920 --> 1:16:37.360]  carlson show it's disgusting and carlson can do whatever he wants all i care about is the
[1:16:37.360 --> 1:16:40.920]  fact that he promotes freedom that's i think he's taking fox news in the right direction
[1:16:40.920 --> 1:16:49.280]  but i have my free speech to say disgusting man i mean i can't even listen or watch him
[1:16:49.280 --> 1:16:57.440]  he is such an oxymoron he is such a joke here's a clip as we go back to the broadcast from
[1:16:57.440 --> 1:17:02.680]  the visit by glenn beck last night i mean this guy's ratings are in the tank his sponsors
[1:17:02.680 --> 1:17:07.920]  of lefting believe me i know i've been talking radio he is getting kicked off stations everywhere
[1:17:07.920 --> 1:17:14.800]  we're exploding and again i'm not in competition with beck but man you know he's like a it's
[1:17:14.800 --> 1:17:18.600]  like i'm a castaway out here in the ocean he's this shark that's been following me for
[1:17:18.600 --> 1:17:26.440]  eight years i mean he's been in my grill for eight years nine years i am so sick of him
[1:17:26.440 --> 1:17:33.480]  leave me alone i can't stand him he's constantly attacking me he's constantly lying about me
[1:17:33.480 --> 1:17:38.880]  he's constantly backstabbing liberty movement i just cannot stand him i think he's a bell
[1:17:38.880 --> 1:17:42.840]  weather i mean if we can't get rid of them back and by get rid of them i mean just just
[1:17:42.840 --> 1:17:47.520]  have him absolutely go away because nobody listens to him then shame on us okay glenn
[1:17:47.520 --> 1:17:52.920]  beck is our stupid meter and the fact that he even has any audience and it's still around
[1:17:52.920 --> 1:17:58.560]  i mean he's worse than meg and kelly what on earth is this piece of filth doing good
[1:17:58.560 --> 1:18:06.960]  god let's grow up oh you think trump will make i don't know i'm excited to see i think
[1:18:06.960 --> 1:18:11.520]  the appointments that he has made some of them are some of them are good some of the
[1:18:11.520 --> 1:18:17.680]  things i'm concerned about but i haven't said anything or i've tried not to say anything
[1:18:17.680 --> 1:18:24.280]  negative about him since the election i've tried unless there was something that was
[1:18:24.280 --> 1:18:29.040]  important to say i want to see the man in action we have i gave him the same thing that
[1:18:29.040 --> 1:18:35.840]  i said about barack obama the election is over and we fought hard and that's the time
[1:18:35.840 --> 1:18:41.520]  to fight hard at the primary and then the election now he has to be all of our presidents
[1:18:41.520 --> 1:18:48.440]  and president and the last president i don't feel ever reached out to do that i have seen
[1:18:48.440 --> 1:18:52.800]  on the very first night donald trump reached out i've seen him reach out to be i wouldn't
[1:18:52.800 --> 1:18:59.760]  have invited al gore to my office he has reached out and i think it's really unfair to judge
[1:18:59.760 --> 1:19:07.080]  him now on what he did on the election i have concerns about the way he ran his campaign
[1:19:07.080 --> 1:19:12.720]  but now let's see if the office changes him and he is the guy everybody who supports him
[1:19:12.720 --> 1:19:18.080]  says he's going to be i hope he is yes have your politics change in watching all this
[1:19:18.080 --> 1:19:22.200]  i've watched things that you've said in the last couple of months you did a pretty widely
[1:19:22.200 --> 1:19:26.680]  circulated interview with samantha b and i read people say well glenn back is changing
[1:19:26.680 --> 1:19:33.120]  his views have your have your political views change no i'm a libertarian i have always been
[1:19:33.120 --> 1:19:37.880]  about principles when i started the nine twelve project it was about values and principles
[1:19:37.880 --> 1:19:44.800]  i think this election became about winners and losers and i understand why hillary clinton
[1:19:44.800 --> 1:19:50.120]  and the press doesn't seem to get this yet they're still trying to figure out why hillary
[1:19:50.120 --> 1:19:55.000]  clinton lost she lost because she was all horrible dishonest candidate and even the
[1:19:55.000 --> 1:19:58.760]  people who are raising money for her would say i can't believe i'm raising money for
[1:19:58.760 --> 1:20:05.480]  her because she's so dishonest that's why she lost it's not good day america are you

[1:26:20.080 --> 1:26:25.960]  Roger you look like you've lost a bit of weight as well how you feeling I'm doing much much
[1:26:25.960 --> 1:26:30.960]  better thank you David yes through the holidays and for some period I have been extraordinarily
[1:26:30.960 --> 1:26:41.040]  ill some kind of intestinal virus and in all candor I'm starting to feel pretty good but
[1:26:41.040 --> 1:26:47.720]  I attribute some of that to silver bullet you're the silver colloidal formula that's
[1:26:47.720 --> 1:26:53.720]  in info wars and also brain force and the reason I say that was because it was in this
[1:26:53.720 --> 1:26:59.640]  exact period that I had to be working on my manuscript which I've now just turned in for
[1:26:59.640 --> 1:27:08.880]  the man pardon me to the making of the president 2016 how Donald Trump was had led orchestrated
[1:27:08.880 --> 1:27:16.160]  an American revolution yeah but I mean for some period of time I had had a fever for
[1:27:16.160 --> 1:27:22.080]  almost 10 days straight I had night sweats I couldn't hold down food I really believe
[1:27:22.080 --> 1:27:27.120]  that a lot of bed rest a lot of fluids that they ultimately had to hydrate me with an
[1:27:27.120 --> 1:27:35.720]  IV why I still think that the info wars products allowed me to kind of bounce back as I have
[1:27:35.720 --> 1:27:42.760]  the deep cleanse was a very important part of this because you know I clearly had I clearly
[1:27:42.760 --> 1:27:46.960]  had a virus I had a hard time shedding anyway I'm glad to be with you well I had the same
[1:27:46.960 --> 1:27:51.320]  type of experiences I've got younger children at home and when they bring something home
[1:27:51.320 --> 1:27:55.400]  I was always the first one to get it out of the rest of the family and how I'm the last
[1:27:55.400 --> 1:27:59.480]  one to get it if I get it at all because I take all these supplements is very important
[1:27:59.480 --> 1:28:04.200]  to have that baseline in your diet and and again as you point out the silver bullet
[1:28:04.200 --> 1:28:09.040]  colloidal silver that's very important yeah well and when I was trying to button up this
[1:28:09.040 --> 1:28:14.760]  book which I think is going to be a blockbuster because there's a lot of inside information
[1:28:14.760 --> 1:28:20.160]  here about how Donald Trump pulled off the greatest political upset in American history
[1:28:20.160 --> 1:28:24.880]  and the role of the alternative media in that and why we've reached a tipping point
[1:28:24.880 --> 1:28:33.400]  in the country I also had to produce my 11th annual Mr. Stone's international best and
[1:28:33.400 --> 1:28:41.160]  worst dressed list now this is a custom that I picked up from the late Mr. Blackwell you
[1:28:41.160 --> 1:28:47.760]  may have remembered him oh yeah yeah he was a Beverly Hills columnist designer arbiter
[1:28:47.760 --> 1:28:52.640]  of fashion now before you go any further it was Meryl Streep on the list he was not on
[1:28:52.640 --> 1:29:00.000]  the list she's overrated she was not on the list but but for the first year oh and shawyer
[1:29:00.000 --> 1:29:06.000]  of info wars on the list yeah and David it was all due respect few people look as good
[1:29:06.000 --> 1:29:11.600]  as you do in a waistcoat so I think you're a contender for next year okay I'll aspire
[1:29:11.600 --> 1:29:16.360]  to that next year when we come along now what's coming up this week we've got it jam packed
[1:29:16.360 --> 1:29:20.760]  with confirmation hearings and Capitol Hill you've always got your nose to the ground
[1:29:20.760 --> 1:29:23.960]  your ear to the ground I should say not your nose but your ear to the ground and Capitol
[1:29:23.960 --> 1:29:28.080]  Hill knowing what's happening there let's start out with the sessions when we come back
[1:29:28.080 --> 1:29:33.840]  from break and I want to get your take on Jeff sessions your take on what's coming up
[1:29:33.840 --> 1:29:38.440]  and the likelihood that all these people are going to get through or if you think some
[1:29:38.440 --> 1:29:42.720]  of them aren't going to make it through I'll be very interested to hear what you know from
[1:29:42.720 --> 1:29:46.600]  your sources in Washington and throughout the Trump campaign we come back we'll be talking
[1:29:46.600 --> 1:29:51.640]  to Roger Stone about the confirmation hearings stay with us we're on the March the empires
[1:29:51.640 --> 1:30:02.940]  on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network here is Michelle Obama in 2008 after her husband
[1:30:02.940 --> 1:30:09.120]  was elected what we've learned over this year is that hope is making a comeback it is making
[1:30:09.120 --> 1:30:16.440]  a comeback and let me tell you something for the first time in my adult lifetime I'm
[1:30:16.440 --> 1:30:21.800]  really proud of my country here she is in 2016 as her husband is leaving office now
[1:30:21.800 --> 1:30:28.480]  we're feeling what not having hope feels like you know I love this according to Michelle
[1:30:28.480 --> 1:30:33.440]  Obama we had hope in 2008 then her husband was in charge for eight years now here in
[1:30:33.440 --> 1:30:40.160]  2017 we have no hope so according to her Barak's legacy is the killer of hope well thank God
[1:30:40.160 --> 1:30:44.760]  real Americans are finally feeling hope with Donald Trump the last bastion of real hope
[1:30:44.760 --> 1:30:50.360]  not just a catchphrase and taking this country back from the no hope Obamas so Obama's legacy
[1:30:50.360 --> 1:31:19.120]  is no hope and Donald Trump this is Owen Schreuer for info wars dot com.

[1:33:36.520 --> 1:33:41.280]  now is roger stone we want to talk to him about the confirmation hearings that are coming
[1:33:41.280 --> 1:33:45.200]  up in washington of course roger is working on a book that is talking about the trump
[1:33:45.200 --> 1:33:49.840]  revolution the thing that brought him to power but it's essential for him to be able to do
[1:33:49.840 --> 1:33:54.520]  the things that he has promised as part of his campaign for him to have the appropriate
[1:33:54.520 --> 1:33:58.920]  people in place I want to talk to roger about what he's heard from those that he knows within
[1:33:58.920 --> 1:34:04.360]  the trump campaign those he knows on capitol hill what is the likelihood of these various
[1:34:04.360 --> 1:34:09.600]  people getting confirmed is there anybody roger that you're concerned about getting
[1:34:09.600 --> 1:34:15.200]  confirmed as we look at sessions and even the obvious political attacks on him by people
[1:34:15.200 --> 1:34:20.840]  like warbooker who are trying to feather their further career and we know that he's going
[1:34:20.840 --> 1:34:25.840]  to run for president in four years and so this is something that he's doing to the choir
[1:34:25.840 --> 1:34:30.640]  that follows him this is a political tribal move that these people are making they know
[1:34:30.640 --> 1:34:35.240]  that Jeff sessions is not a racist anybody who has looked at his career anybody who knows
[1:34:35.240 --> 1:34:39.120]  him knows that even the people who are attacking him right now have said in the past what a
[1:34:39.120 --> 1:34:43.720]  great guy he is but for political points are they're attacking him now I don't think that's
[1:34:43.720 --> 1:34:47.160]  going to stop them most people don't think that's going to stop him now in the confirmation
[1:34:47.160 --> 1:34:51.920]  process is there do you agree with that do you think there's anybody that is vulnerable
[1:34:51.920 --> 1:34:56.240]  in this confirmation process well first of all David I think you have to look at the
[1:34:56.240 --> 1:35:05.520]  situation in context the political establishment harped on the popular vote they harped on
[1:35:05.520 --> 1:35:13.000]  the question of recount in Wisconsin and Michigan and Pennsylvania none of which had any basis
[1:35:13.000 --> 1:35:20.600]  in terms of irregularity they harped upon trying to badger and threaten electors to
[1:35:20.600 --> 1:35:28.160]  not vote for Donald Trump but worse than all of that they have continued this relentless
[1:35:28.160 --> 1:35:37.840]  Russian hacking canard past its due date now the Democrats John Podesta the Clintons we
[1:35:37.840 --> 1:35:44.040]  heard this theme loud and clear that the Russians were behind WikiLeaks that they were responsible
[1:35:44.040 --> 1:35:53.880]  for this attack on Hillary it is not was not true then it is not true now the extraordinary
[1:35:53.880 --> 1:36:01.040]  lengths that the intelligence services have gone to construct a myth is disturbing in
[1:36:01.040 --> 1:36:08.600]  other words if one will look at the hearings run by John McCain what you will really learn
[1:36:08.600 --> 1:36:14.920]  if you read the and listen for the fine print is an assessment of the situation says Putin
[1:36:14.920 --> 1:36:19.680]  ran the show in the hack turn election and another point they tell us that members of
[1:36:19.680 --> 1:36:28.400]  the committee were briefed no Republican on the House or the Senate intelligence committees
[1:36:28.400 --> 1:36:36.200]  all of whom are allowed to see classified documents have seen no irrefutable proof of
[1:36:36.200 --> 1:36:44.400]  this the few documents that were attached to this special report that was prepared for
[1:36:44.400 --> 1:36:53.320]  the president showed that RT attacked Hillary on their Twitter feed a year ago so so so
[1:36:53.320 --> 1:37:00.800]  at the New York Times particularly Scott Shane see an investigative reporter CNN but the
[1:37:00.800 --> 1:37:06.880]  truth is and nobody wants to say this is there is no proof we have an allegation and when
[1:37:06.880 --> 1:37:13.440]  you have people like John Brennan the CIA director a man who converted to Wahabism the
[1:37:13.440 --> 1:37:20.000]  most extreme form of Muslim a man who refused to be sworn in with his hand on the Bible
[1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:27.280]  a man who I believe cleansed Barack Obama's passport file this guy with a long association
[1:37:27.280 --> 1:37:34.640]  of Communist Party activity this guy is a thug with a motive like Morrell the former
[1:37:34.640 --> 1:37:41.960]  assistant the former acting CIA director they roll him out to continue the Russian canard
[1:37:41.960 --> 1:37:48.200]  Morrell covered up the lives of Benghazi and he's now on the payroll of some Clinton connected
[1:37:48.200 --> 1:37:56.480]  PR firm acting CIA director after Petraeus was taken out for his security lapses and
[1:37:56.480 --> 1:38:00.920]  so he then turned around and supported Hillary Clinton even though it showed that she had
[1:38:00.920 --> 1:38:05.040]  thrown national security under the bus in a very careless haphazard manner but this
[1:38:05.040 --> 1:38:08.440]  is a guy who has always been a never-trumper Mike Morrell so that's very disturbing to
[1:38:08.440 --> 1:38:15.360]  see that from the CIA yes well and Trump and BAW BAI in New York had an excellent report
[1:38:15.360 --> 1:38:20.880]  the other night about Trump's plans to reform the intelligence services these rogue agencies
[1:38:20.880 --> 1:38:25.840]  need to be reined in they don't want to they want to continue to lie and murder and break
[1:38:25.840 --> 1:38:31.960]  federal law and break their charter as they have you know ad nauseam they lied about Benghazi
[1:38:31.960 --> 1:38:36.600]  they lied about Vietnam they lied about the Kennedy assassination they lied about Iran
[1:38:36.600 --> 1:38:42.840]  Contra they have lied about everything part of being a spy is the ability to lie and
[1:38:42.840 --> 1:38:46.560]  either the intelligence services will control the president or the president will control
[1:38:46.560 --> 1:38:53.240]  the intelligence services so what really has these guys in high drive over this whole Russian
[1:38:53.240 --> 1:38:58.120]  canard is the fact that Trump threatens to clean up the whole shop and that scares the
[1:38:58.120 --> 1:39:02.480]  daylights out of them David just scares them to death and there's no limit as to what they
[1:39:02.480 --> 1:39:08.560]  will lie about as a matter of fact one of the former CIA officials went on CNN and accused
[1:39:08.560 --> 1:39:12.360]  Julian Assange of being a pedophile and WikiLeaks wouldn't have any of it they immediately came
[1:39:12.360 --> 1:39:15.880]  out said you better do a retraction within 24 hours we're going to come after you and
[1:39:15.880 --> 1:39:19.560]  they did something of a retraction but it's just that's the kind of lies that we see
[1:39:19.560 --> 1:39:25.360]  being thrown out there by this these politicized intelligence agencies all of the charges of
[1:39:25.360 --> 1:39:31.800]  sexual misconduct about against Julian Assange are manufactured yes this is a hallmark of
[1:39:31.800 --> 1:39:36.920]  British intelligence the honey trap with the woman the woman who very clearly had consensual
[1:39:36.920 --> 1:39:41.520]  sex or may have had consensual sex later remembers that she was assaulted and she's
[1:39:41.520 --> 1:39:50.360]  an asset with long records so please it's tedious number one number two again John
[1:39:50.360 --> 1:39:56.320]  Podesta alleges before the election that Roger Stone must have known in advance that he is
[1:39:56.320 --> 1:40:02.800]  emails being hacked based on a tweet in which I said that specifically his time in the barrel
[1:40:02.800 --> 1:40:08.560]  would come soon meaning his business activities would soon be exposed as Paul Manafort's
[1:40:08.560 --> 1:40:14.760]  were in a furious smear campaign by the Clintonites this refers to an article I published at the
[1:40:14.760 --> 1:40:21.760]  Stone Cold Truths about money laundering the Russian mob and Mr. Podesta none of this information
[1:40:21.760 --> 1:40:30.600]  comes from WikiLeaks those are unrelated matters secondarily Mr. Podesta and his friends continue
[1:40:30.600 --> 1:40:38.000]  to maintain on Twitter every day that because I predicted that on October 5th Assange would
[1:40:38.000 --> 1:40:44.560]  begin releasing information devastating to Hillary that that meant I knew what the nature
[1:40:44.560 --> 1:40:51.280]  of it was and what his exact schedule was I also knew through an intermediary that I've
[1:40:51.280 --> 1:41:00.320]  been very frank about that whatever Assange had was unspecified political dynamite I did
[1:41:00.320 --> 1:41:06.840]  not know whether it was related to the Clinton Foundation or or or or Podesta or anything
[1:41:06.840 --> 1:41:15.120]  else so these two tweets prove nothing they do not prove advanced knowledge by stone but
[1:41:15.120 --> 1:41:20.000]  try going on Twitter and you'll see Brock and these and these other maggots just in
[1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:26.880]  their bots constantly you know stone tipped off his friend Donald Trump to Russian hacking
[1:41:26.880 --> 1:41:32.320]  of Clinton camp false yeah yeah they're very selective about what they want to put out and
[1:41:32.320 --> 1:41:36.320]  of course say everybody was talking about Manafort and lobbyist connections to Russia
[1:41:36.320 --> 1:41:40.120]  but nobody talked about Podesta's well lobbyist connections to Russia and that's what you
[1:41:40.120 --> 1:41:43.640]  were talking about you said hey people are going to take a look at Podesta's connections
[1:41:43.640 --> 1:41:49.040]  to Russia and that was very well known but they also put no credibility Roger and British
[1:41:49.040 --> 1:41:52.320]  ambassadors we've got the current British ambassador saying hey have people in Washington
[1:41:52.320 --> 1:41:57.520]  tell me they were the ones who handed this over that there wasn't a cyber security violation
[1:41:57.520 --> 1:42:02.800]  to get this information another former British ambassador said I traveled to the United States
[1:42:02.800 --> 1:42:07.440]  and I was handed information about the DNC by somebody who was upset about what was happening
[1:42:07.440 --> 1:42:11.520]  with Bernie Sanders he was a supporter of Bernie Sanders he was upset about the corruption
[1:42:11.520 --> 1:42:15.240]  within the DNC he said they handed that to me but of course they don't give that any credibility
[1:42:15.240 --> 1:42:22.080]  in the intelligence reports well I guess the real hood spot to me though is that Podesta
[1:42:22.080 --> 1:42:29.040]  made these charges against me before the election Kerry in prime time twice by CNN that because
[1:42:29.040 --> 1:42:33.920]  of these two tweets which I just explained I had to know in advance that he was being
[1:42:33.920 --> 1:42:40.160]  hacked and that I had to know who's being hacked by the Russians right after the election
[1:42:40.160 --> 1:42:46.640]  he actually posted an op-ed piece of the Washington Post repeating this this now recycled tired
[1:42:46.640 --> 1:42:54.000]  false narrative they'd never give up it's just not it none of it is true I had no advanced
[1:42:54.000 --> 1:43:00.240]  knowledge of the specific items or focus of any assigned his material on the 6th he announced
[1:43:00.240 --> 1:43:06.320]  that he would be having disclosures once a week for 10 weeks I was correct he did have
[1:43:06.320 --> 1:43:11.880]  unspecified political dynamite by the way assigns himself went on the record in an interview
[1:43:11.880 --> 1:43:17.280]  I believe with Associated Press saying as much himself only days earlier and of course
[1:43:17.280 --> 1:43:20.640]  you had William Benny he's been on the show multiple times a former technical head of
[1:43:20.640 --> 1:43:24.600]  the NSA going record yet again saying no I don't believe it was the Russians I believe
[1:43:24.600 --> 1:43:28.400]  it was internal we had Ray McGovern who was with the CIA he used to be the person who
[1:43:28.400 --> 1:43:31.880]  briefed the president saying I don't believe it was the Russians I believe it was internal
[1:43:31.880 --> 1:43:37.440]  so we've got NSA whistleblower we've got CIA former CIA also saying that and then we've
[1:43:37.440 --> 1:43:44.000]  got all of the technical people who are laughing at this technical report that came out we've
[1:43:44.000 --> 1:43:49.000]  had John McAfee say look if you look at this they say their circumstantial evidence is
[1:43:49.000 --> 1:43:54.400]  a time zone stamp that looks like it's coming from Russia looks like it was done on a Cyrillic
[1:43:54.400 --> 1:43:59.400]  keyboard so forth and so on he goes only an amateur organization would leave those kind
[1:43:59.400 --> 1:44:02.400]  of footprints if it really was the Russians and they would leave that kind of footprints
[1:44:02.400 --> 1:44:06.840]  they're incredible amateurs but then they even used an out of date by about a year and a
[1:44:06.840 --> 1:44:11.840]  half and three revs an out of date version of malware to go in and get this information
[1:44:11.840 --> 1:44:17.280]  and all of this ignores the fact that Goose for 1.0 was able to get all the private emails
[1:44:17.280 --> 1:44:22.760]  of Colin Powell and George W. Bush and Tony Blair and everything without being a computer
[1:44:22.760 --> 1:44:27.120]  expert he didn't have any state security apparatus behind him to hack all this stuff he just guessed
[1:44:27.120 --> 1:44:32.640]  their passwords it's not too hard to guess Bethesda's password it's password well but
[1:44:32.640 --> 1:44:38.440]  they refused to give up trying to flag the same horse there just there just is nothing
[1:44:38.440 --> 1:44:44.960]  there but I guess the point to go back to your question to frame this is all of this
[1:44:44.960 --> 1:44:50.280]  shows how determined they are to do anything humanly possible to block Donald Trump and
[1:44:50.280 --> 1:44:57.240]  reform agendas so yes Chuck Schumer who's a bit of a Carney Barker is going to do everything
[1:44:57.240 --> 1:45:05.520]  humanly possible to cast dispersions on and derail all of the Trump nominees I expect
[1:45:05.520 --> 1:45:12.040]  a vigorous fight over Rex Tillerson who I think is a brilliant outside the box choice
[1:45:12.040 --> 1:45:19.640]  I mean I actually saw where Trump was criticized for choosing the Ford Motor Company executive
[1:45:19.640 --> 1:45:26.840]  because he had a personal relationship with Vladimir Putin mm-hmm as Donald himself said
[1:45:26.840 --> 1:45:31.160]  to me that's precisely why you choose someone like him yeah he knows it's time to start
[1:45:31.160 --> 1:45:36.920]  talking mm-hmm time to start talking to see if we might have peace yes in other words
[1:45:36.920 --> 1:45:42.320]  Trump is very clearly the candidate of detente he understands that these people have horrific
[1:45:42.320 --> 1:45:49.760]  weapons as do we and although communism may have fallen this is the this is the the tinderbox
[1:45:49.760 --> 1:45:58.520]  that could set off world war three or not mm-hmm Hillary and her neocon buddies were clamoring
[1:45:58.520 --> 1:46:05.440]  for war what when I spoke at a New Yorker conference just before the election in October
[1:46:05.440 --> 1:46:11.320]  on the lower west side of Manhattan which is trust me taking your life in your hands
[1:46:11.320 --> 1:46:19.560]  if you're a conservative and the the former wall street journalist max boot was on the
[1:46:19.560 --> 1:46:27.560]  panel and he was drooling for war with the Russians mm-hmm so this we have not narrowly
[1:46:27.560 --> 1:46:32.400]  averted World War two although David even as we speak Obama has moved special forces
[1:46:32.400 --> 1:46:38.200]  to the Russian border yes yes I mean so they keep stepping closer and closer to Armageddon
[1:46:38.200 --> 1:46:45.640]  the question we had some more sanctions against Russia as well well so so we we expelled thirty
[1:46:45.640 --> 1:46:51.440]  nine diplomats based on no proofs that they hacked anybody mm-hmm yeah and they've been
[1:46:51.440 --> 1:46:56.160]  there the entire Obama administration we see his private property that they purchased under
[1:46:56.160 --> 1:47:01.800]  our system of laws and property regulation so I call that an illegal taking but I guess
[1:47:01.800 --> 1:47:06.320]  they have no rights since they're not American citizens but it violates an American principle
[1:47:06.320 --> 1:47:13.480]  of private property I guess it's like civil asset forfeiture right I presume yeah you
[1:47:13.480 --> 1:47:19.880]  know for eight years for eight years Putin kicks this guy's butt around the block the
[1:47:19.880 --> 1:47:25.960]  resets a joke the line in the sand is a joke and now suddenly he wants to be tough on Putin
[1:47:25.960 --> 1:47:32.560]  suddenly with days left to go on his term this whole motion that they keep saying why is Trump
[1:47:32.560 --> 1:47:41.920]  so chummy with Putin what is it with this bromit he wants to make a deal for peace mm-hmm
[1:47:41.920 --> 1:47:46.160]  he wants he would rather spend money on our infrastructure than building a war machine
[1:47:46.160 --> 1:47:50.520]  to destroy each other a hundred times over of course one of the things that concerns
[1:47:50.520 --> 1:47:55.760]  me Roger is the fact that yes this narrative is playing to their political base it is posturing
[1:47:55.760 --> 1:48:00.960]  it is enforcing this tribalism and they're being very reckless in terms of tweaking the
[1:48:00.960 --> 1:48:05.880]  Russians nose with us and they want to come after Trump but also I think Roger they want
[1:48:05.880 --> 1:48:11.720]  to get their nose under the tent in terms of future elections and inserting Homeland
[1:48:11.720 --> 1:48:16.760]  Security into the voting machines that we have that are run throughout the various state
[1:48:16.760 --> 1:48:21.200]  jurisdictions and that's a very troubling move that they have put here I think that's
[1:48:21.200 --> 1:48:26.200]  one of the things we all should be very alarmed at and I hope that Donald Trump as he said
[1:48:26.200 --> 1:48:30.600]  to reporters he said look if you got something that is very important we all know that computers
[1:48:30.600 --> 1:48:33.640]  are not safe if you got something important you write it down on a piece of paper and
[1:48:33.640 --> 1:48:38.720]  you deliver it with a courier that's the way our elections ought to be run yes well several
[1:48:38.720 --> 1:48:44.040]  things here first of all these individual computerized voting machines are very easily
[1:48:44.040 --> 1:48:52.640]  hacked yes a manipulated to some extent they are connected to a central server controlled
[1:48:52.640 --> 1:48:58.080]  either by the manufacturer or the jurisdiction who's using the machine so could you are you
[1:48:58.080 --> 1:49:04.800]  networked enough to steal an election in one county in say Ohio the answer is yes is possible
[1:49:04.800 --> 1:49:09.920]  but all the machines everywhere are not are not networked to each other so a enormous
[1:49:09.920 --> 1:49:18.120]  national hack and movement of votes is I believe a technical impossibility when I raised these
[1:49:18.120 --> 1:49:24.920]  questions Hillary Clinton in the left went crazy how irresponsible of me when they wanted
[1:49:24.920 --> 1:49:32.360]  a recount in Wisconsin a 3.5 million dollar recount their only argument David was these
[1:49:32.360 --> 1:49:38.080]  machines are very susceptible to hacking and manipulation no evidence no evidence whatsoever
[1:49:38.080 --> 1:49:44.800]  yeah so I you know this is a distinction that that is that is that I think people are missing
[1:49:44.800 --> 1:49:52.960]  secondarily in all candor and Trump has pretty much said this the Chinese the North Koreans
[1:49:52.960 --> 1:50:02.960]  the Saudis the Israelis the Russians have most likely all hacked American political
[1:50:02.960 --> 1:50:07.840]  documents Hillary Clinton was the one who left the gate open with an unsecured server
[1:50:07.840 --> 1:50:15.800]  you can bet they all have that I know for a fact that Turkish intelligence has the Huma
[1:50:15.800 --> 1:50:25.960]  Abedin Anthony Weiner 650,000 email record because their intelligence service obtained
[1:50:25.960 --> 1:50:33.560]  it so it is you know this this is it really is getting very old and it is time for those
[1:50:33.560 --> 1:50:37.560]  who oppose Trump to recognize you there's a new sheriff in town yeah well the thing I'm
[1:50:37.560 --> 1:50:40.360]  concerned about is that they're throwing this narrative out there they're not saying right
[1:50:40.360 --> 1:50:45.200]  now technically that our election machines were hacked but that's what they're implying
[1:50:45.200 --> 1:50:49.840]  and then they follow through to make sure that they do have access to all these machines
[1:50:49.840 --> 1:50:54.800]  at the local level that's the real danger when we come back from break and we'll also
[1:50:54.800 --> 1:51:02.080]  ask Roger Stone does Jeff Sessions get a vote if he's confirmed reality check rampant hacking

[1:54:22.280 --> 1:54:26.080]  got some more questions for roger not only about the confirmation technicalities but
[1:54:26.080 --> 1:54:29.960]  also what's going to happen in the run up to the inauguration we've had a lot of people
[1:54:29.960 --> 1:54:34.440]  saying that they're going to get rough with the inauguration that that's going to be
[1:54:34.440 --> 1:54:39.200]  a lot of protests i want to see what rogers heard about this we also have coming up in
[1:54:39.200 --> 1:54:44.440]  the next hour we're going to be talking to the man who invented email i wish i bet hillary
[1:54:44.440 --> 1:54:51.440]  says she'd never heard of email but he's going to be joining us and what his specialty is
[1:54:51.440 --> 1:54:55.000]  is biology and he's going to be talking to us about some very troubling things he's found
[1:54:55.000 --> 1:55:00.680]  about genetically modified organisms so we're going to be talking to him in the next hour
[1:55:00.680 --> 1:55:09.200]  before we do think about your health at this moment think about the natural basis the biological
[1:55:09.200 --> 1:55:15.040]  essential minerals and nutrients that you need to give your body what it needs to protect
[1:55:15.040 --> 1:55:19.480]  itself to grow to protect itself against toxic garbage that you find your food your water
[1:55:19.480 --> 1:55:23.560]  your air you're constantly under chemical sage and we're going to talk about that when
[1:55:23.560 --> 1:55:30.320]  we talk about gmo but also your body has certain essential nutrients and minerals
[1:55:30.320 --> 1:55:34.520]  vitamins that you need and of course one of those is selenium there's no question about
[1:55:34.520 --> 1:55:37.880]  that if you look at all of the different studies that we've had about selenium many people
[1:55:37.880 --> 1:55:42.160]  have done it it's important to the immune system it's important to your thyroid gland
[1:55:42.160 --> 1:55:47.920]  DNA production to eyesight the question is what source of selenium to get that's always
[1:55:47.920 --> 1:55:51.080]  a question you look at these and say well I know I need this supplement or that supplement
[1:55:51.080 --> 1:55:55.200]  but what am I really getting well I'll tell you what you're getting at info wars bio true
[1:55:55.200 --> 1:56:02.240]  selenium is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed most of the selenium supplements
[1:56:02.240 --> 1:56:07.080]  on the market are produced with synthetic selenium that's not what we sell so it's
[1:56:07.080 --> 1:56:12.520]  a great source of selenium it's been sold out at info wars life for several weeks now
[1:56:12.520 --> 1:56:18.600]  and it's now back in stock also we have put on sale several very important products for

[1:56:58.240 --> 1:57:02.040]  break I had a question about Jeff session since he's the first person who is coming up for
[1:57:02.040 --> 1:57:07.920]  confirmation if he gets through will he be able to vote on the coming confirmations for
[1:57:07.920 --> 1:57:11.120]  these other people that Trump has picked for his cabinet.
[1:57:11.120 --> 1:57:15.880]  I think technically Jeff sessions would remain the US senator from Alabama until the moment
[1:57:15.880 --> 1:57:20.560]  that he resigned the office and most logically he would resign at the moment that he took
[1:57:20.560 --> 1:57:27.600]  the oath of office as secretary of state that's not the same thing as the day he would be
[1:57:27.600 --> 1:57:33.080]  confirmed by the Senate by the way so I imagine that he could pretend he could preserve his
[1:57:33.080 --> 1:57:40.400]  senatorial power which gives him a very valuable former forum if this turns into be a lynching
[1:57:40.400 --> 1:57:43.200]  yeah yeah so he's going to be there for the rest of the confirmation hearings that's
[1:57:43.200 --> 1:57:47.840]  very important yeah Michael that would be my that would be my legal interpretation now
[1:57:47.840 --> 1:57:54.160]  I would defer to say judge Andrew Napolitano some others for an examination of those laws
[1:57:54.160 --> 1:57:58.920]  but that's my impression yeah that makes sense but I must tell you David I have known Jeff
[1:57:58.920 --> 1:58:04.360]  sessions since he was active in the young republicans in Alabama at a time that I was
[1:58:04.360 --> 1:58:10.760]  active in the young republicans in Virginia and just prior to a time that I became young
[1:58:10.760 --> 1:58:17.320]  republican national chairman Jeff sessions is no racist he does not have a racist bone
[1:58:17.320 --> 1:58:24.440]  in his body he is a decent man who's a serious student of the Constitution I agree who's deeply
[1:58:24.440 --> 1:58:28.840]  concerned about the fact that if we do not seal our borders we are going to cease to
[1:58:28.840 --> 1:58:32.880]  be a country stay with us we're going to take a quick break and when we come right back
[1:58:32.880 --> 1:58:37.520]  we're going to ask Roger what he sees coming up with the inauguration activists say they

[2:00:39.280 --> 2:00:43.240]  roger we've got an article from michael sniders blog and he's going to be joining us later
[2:00:43.240 --> 2:00:47.960]  in the week he said activists are hoping to turn trumps inauguration into one of the biggest
[2:00:47.960 --> 2:00:55.320]  riots in us history what do you think about this my own intelligence tells me that as
[2:00:55.320 --> 2:01:04.280]  well david the the group disrupt j 20 which is kind of sits upon a an umbrella group of
[2:01:04.280 --> 2:01:11.560]  lefty hook organizations funded yet again by george soros directed yet again by david
[2:01:11.560 --> 2:01:18.760]  broth same people who just spent 300 400 million losing the last election are just back at it
[2:01:18.760 --> 2:01:26.920]  again and we we know from our own intelligence that they plan to create a sense of crisis
[2:01:26.920 --> 2:01:33.080]  a sense of of of of violence that they are going to be harassing secret service agents
[2:01:33.080 --> 2:01:39.480]  and other uniformed law enforcement officers that they will be uh harassing visitors as
[2:01:39.480 --> 2:01:46.600]  they step on and off the metro or as visitors attempt to attend an inaugural event um we
[2:01:46.600 --> 2:01:52.440]  know they're going to have roving protesters with drums seeking to drown out speakers at
[2:01:52.440 --> 2:02:02.600]  the um at the inaugural events um they uh have um geared up here in a stunning i think
[2:02:02.600 --> 2:02:11.880]  uh example of a get prop of of astroturf of phony um uh disruption and uh you know their
[2:02:11.880 --> 2:02:18.360]  march against fascism and so on the i think that's going to go over as well as all of their

[2:02:22.120 --> 2:02:26.840]  yes but here's the here's kind of the new information um the deplorable
[2:02:26.840 --> 2:02:33.960]  law which is on the evening of the 19th at the national press club this is the people's

[2:02:47.960 --> 2:02:57.720]  uh and we now know uh that uh groups have prepared to disrupt this party that they in
[2:02:57.720 --> 2:03:06.440]  plan to throw baggies filled with urine uh in bleach right they that they will um harass those
[2:03:06.440 --> 2:03:13.240]  seeking to uh to enter the event but that they have also gotten their hands on tickets which
[2:03:13.240 --> 2:03:21.240]  means they will have quizlings inside the hall um they are seeking violent confrontation uh and then
[2:03:21.240 --> 2:03:26.920]  as we saw in the election the violence of course is blamed on donald trump and his supporters oh
[2:03:26.920 --> 2:03:31.000]  yeah no matter what they what they do to people no matter how they instigated it will always be
[2:03:31.000 --> 2:03:35.640]  blamed on trump i mean they blame that situation where those four black teenagers grabbed that
[2:03:35.640 --> 2:03:39.720]  mentally handicapped white guy and berated him they blamed that on donald trump so it
[2:03:39.720 --> 2:03:45.800]  no matter how absurd it is they will double down on that narrative well and uh in this case i look
[2:03:45.800 --> 2:03:51.560]  the folks running the deplorable um uh know what they're doing they'll be very good security this
[2:03:51.560 --> 2:03:59.560]  is going to be the event to be at uh if you are you know part of the trump uh train this is not
[2:03:59.560 --> 2:04:05.400]  where you're gonna meet the other cabinet officers it's not a 25 000 ticket event but this is this
[2:04:05.400 --> 2:04:11.720]  is among activists the primo event the left knows this uh and they're going to seek to disrupt it
[2:04:11.720 --> 2:04:18.040]  this is this could be extremely ugly uh yes i think what they have planned is chicago 1968
[2:04:20.120 --> 2:04:24.600]  they're looking for chaos yeah it's a time where people who've worked really hard to make this
[2:04:24.600 --> 2:04:28.360]  revolution happen it's a time that they want to have to celebrate but i think key thing that's
[2:04:28.360 --> 2:04:33.080]  going to come out of this is the distinction between barack obama and his hollywood elite
[2:04:33.080 --> 2:04:38.520]  partying the way they party ball after ball after ball and the fact that donald trump is very quickly
[2:04:38.520 --> 2:04:42.360]  going to get right down to business i think we're going to see a lot of changes
[2:04:42.360 --> 2:04:47.400]  on day one i think that's going to really show a distinction between obama and donald trump
[2:04:47.400 --> 2:04:51.960]  thank you so much for joining us roger stone and we're going to be right back with dr shiva
[2:04:51.960 --> 2:05:01.640]  aya duray the inventor of email and his warnings about gmo well as alsharpton promised there were
[2:05:01.640 --> 2:05:08.040]  protesters at jeff sessions hearing today chanting no racist no kkk meanwhile sessions was speaking
[2:05:08.040 --> 2:05:12.840]  inside to the importance of civil rights the man fought for civil rights and desegregation in the
[2:05:12.840 --> 2:05:18.440]  south for years more than most attorneys at the time and people are outside protesting his racism
[2:05:18.440 --> 2:05:23.320]  multiple protesters made it inside and were arrested the adults inside were also discussing
[2:05:23.320 --> 2:05:28.120]  law enforcement which session says he supports a drug epidemic which says and said he would fight
[2:05:28.120 --> 2:05:32.680]  the clinton email server and the clinton foundation were brought up and session said if these cases
[2:05:32.680 --> 2:05:38.120]  reached his desk he would recuse himself as unfit to be impartial diane feinstein decided to bring
[2:05:38.120 --> 2:05:42.520]  up the importance of the rovers weight decision and how important it is to make sure abortions
[2:05:42.520 --> 2:05:47.480]  are available so fearing all those babies might be saved feinstein asked sessions if he would
[2:05:47.480 --> 2:05:52.680]  respect that decision sessions said he disagreed with the law but respects it as law so jeff sessions
[2:05:52.680 --> 2:05:58.040]  will be the attorney general the protests have failed again this is owin schreuer for info wars

[2:07:02.360 --> 2:07:07.000]  that needs to be cleaned it's the air we're breathing especially for our children the artificial
[2:07:07.000 --> 2:07:13.480]  particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems the same team based
[2:07:13.480 --> 2:07:18.680]  right here in america that brought you the elects of pure groundbreaking water filtration systems
[2:07:18.680 --> 2:07:24.040]  have now developed elects of pure breeze whether it's your home or office yo it's yourself your
[2:07:24.040 --> 2:07:30.200]  co-workers your family your children do the best job you can to purify your air the elite are masters
[2:07:30.200 --> 2:07:35.640]  at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most toxic
[2:07:35.640 --> 2:07:41.720]  effects for themselves the general public doesn't the elects of pure breeze would be a steel at 300
[2:07:41.720 --> 2:07:47.480]  400 500 dollars one of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean this is a system
[2:07:47.480 --> 2:07:51.880]  i'm personally putting in throughout my house replacing older more expensive filters that didn't
[2:07:51.880 --> 2:08:08.120]  do as good a job find out why this system is so revolutionary today and then for warstore.com
[2:08:08.120 --> 2:08:23.960]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night your host today we had a story at info wars
[2:08:23.960 --> 2:08:31.640]  a week or so ago about a new study that showed that gmo soy accumulates cancerous formaldehyde
[2:08:31.640 --> 2:08:38.280]  now we're going to talk to the man behind that study uh he is uh what many people call polymath
[2:08:38.280 --> 2:08:44.440]  that is somebody who is an expert in widely diverse fields think about thomas jefferson for
[2:08:44.440 --> 2:08:49.800]  example it was all over everything well dr shiva ayadure is one of those types of people he has
[2:08:49.800 --> 2:08:54.680]  four degrees from mit he's a world renowned systems scientist he's an inventor he's an
[2:08:54.680 --> 2:09:04.440]  entrepreneur as a 14 year old he invented email and hillary clinton wishes that he never existed
[2:09:04.440 --> 2:09:11.800]  at this point i think he gave her enough technical rope to hang herself publicly and email has played
[2:09:11.800 --> 2:09:16.360]  a big part in her life has played a big part in our lives as well as a great invention
[2:09:16.360 --> 2:09:24.360]  and he's the guy who invented it now he's really as his core focus has been as a biologist and he
[2:09:24.360 --> 2:09:32.280]  has developed a system uh cytosol he's a chairman and ceo of cytosol ink and he uh does modeling
[2:09:32.920 --> 2:09:38.440]  of biological systems and that has allowed him to that's the basis of this study so we're going
[2:09:38.440 --> 2:09:44.440]  to talk to him about these things but there is a common thread he is somebody who supports liberty
[2:09:44.440 --> 2:09:50.040]  and he is somebody who understands the danger of the military industrial complex so we were
[2:09:50.040 --> 2:09:56.360]  warned about that by uh president eisenhower and we have seen that come true and he talks about it
[2:09:56.360 --> 2:10:00.920]  in the same way that eisenhower originally was going to talk about it as the military industrial
[2:10:00.920 --> 2:10:07.320]  academic complex and that's the way that dr ayadure talks about it because it really truly
[2:10:07.320 --> 2:10:14.760]  does roll together uh academia in a very vital way into this whole uh aspect but uh we got a lot
[2:10:14.760 --> 2:10:19.560]  of topics to start with let's thank you for joining us dr ayadure let's start with the email
[2:10:19.560 --> 2:10:25.720]  tell us how as a 14 year old uh you came about to develop uh email and of course there was
[2:10:25.720 --> 2:10:31.480]  just a recent lawsuit we keep seeing gawker media turn up in these lawsuits on the losing side and
[2:10:31.480 --> 2:10:35.800]  they just lost the lawsuit with you so tell us about your invention and tell us about the
[2:10:35.800 --> 2:10:43.560]  lawsuit with gawker over this yeah thank you great introduction by the way um so so i think the
[2:10:43.560 --> 2:10:48.840]  point is you know email i think the heart of it was not invented by the military the military
[2:10:48.840 --> 2:10:54.600]  industrial complex it didn't come out of the elite triangle of mit or silicon valier big industry
[2:10:54.600 --> 2:11:00.680]  the fact is you know i invented as a 14 year old kid in newark new jersey at a small medical
[2:11:00.680 --> 2:11:05.880]  college and what i was fundamentally doing was solving a civilian problem if you remember in
[2:11:05.880 --> 2:11:11.320]  those days um in many organizations there was a thing called the inter office mail system
[2:11:11.880 --> 2:11:18.280]  it was how all organizations collaborated at the heart of this uh inter office mail system was a
[2:11:18.280 --> 2:11:24.360]  secretary on her desktop was the inbox outbox folders underneath her desk was a trash can on
[2:11:24.360 --> 2:11:29.240]  top of her desk was the address book she would write a thing called a memo and had a very specific
[2:11:29.240 --> 2:11:34.840]  structure to from subjects she would make carbon copies business essentially got done through the
[2:11:34.840 --> 2:11:39.560]  inter office mail system wasn't simple exchange of text messages so as a 14 year old kid i was one
[2:11:39.560 --> 2:11:46.840]  of those very overachieving kids i was also good at believe it or not in um in sports but i went
[2:11:46.840 --> 2:11:53.080]  off to nyu because i finished my math courses by the time i was a 14 year old kid calculus and i
[2:11:53.080 --> 2:11:57.400]  took a i was accepted to a special math program at nyu in the quaren institute of mathematical
[2:11:57.400 --> 2:12:02.840]  sciences in fact in a special computer science program where i learned seven programming language
[2:12:02.840 --> 2:12:07.960]  after i finished that my parents were afraid of me dropping out and i got a job at a small medical
[2:12:07.960 --> 2:12:13.480]  college called the university of medicine dentistry in newark and i was given this task of converting
[2:12:13.480 --> 2:12:19.320]  that entire inter office mail system and i put the word on system into the electronic computer
[2:12:19.320 --> 2:12:24.200]  based version and i called that email a term never used before in the english language but not only
[2:12:24.200 --> 2:12:30.440]  that i converted all those hundred features in 50 000 lines of code across the system of 35 programs
[2:12:31.160 --> 2:12:35.880]  and it was used it was successful we charged for it hundreds of people used it in that
[2:12:36.520 --> 2:12:42.440]  entire university and more importantly what was interesting was at that time the policymakers
[2:12:42.440 --> 2:12:48.440]  in washington didn't understand software it was only in 1994 could you even patent software
[2:12:48.440 --> 2:12:54.680]  but in 1980 the copyright act of 1976 was amended so you could use copyright to protect
[2:12:54.680 --> 2:12:59.480]  software invention so as a young 18 year old kid when i was at mit i sent away for the copyright
[2:12:59.480 --> 2:13:06.120]  and it was not a trivial process you had to fill in a ton of paperwork and i was issued the first
[2:13:06.120 --> 2:13:10.920]  us copyright for email again the only way to protect software so i was officially recognized
[2:13:10.920 --> 2:13:17.480]  as a matter of email so not only did i create this electronic version um of this entire system
[2:13:17.480 --> 2:13:21.880]  called the email but i also got the copyright so the facts were essentially black and white
[2:13:21.880 --> 2:13:27.240]  and i never sought you know penny for the for it nor did i seek any type of fame for it
[2:13:27.800 --> 2:13:31.800]  let me interrupt you a second and say that that's a very interesting thing because now what we're
[2:13:31.800 --> 2:13:36.840]  seeing in technology with the copyrights we're seeing very abusive use of the copyright system
[2:13:36.840 --> 2:13:41.640]  where we have people say that they file these junk patents and say well i got an idea that you could
[2:13:41.640 --> 2:13:47.480]  put pictures on a on a cell phone and then they'll hold up apple and they'll hold up samsung and all
[2:13:47.480 --> 2:13:51.400]  these companies and say pay me royalties for this type of thing you never sought to capitalize on
[2:13:51.400 --> 2:13:57.640]  that at all in that way exactly so you know between that period 1980 to 1994 you could only use
[2:13:57.640 --> 2:14:03.560]  copyright and only in 1994 to the federal court of appeals allowed the use of patents for protecting
[2:14:03.560 --> 2:14:10.360]  software now we have to understand the whole notion of copyright or patents was originally
[2:14:10.360 --> 2:14:15.560]  done for independent inventors to protect themselves for a short period of time and then it was
[2:14:15.560 --> 2:14:20.920]  publicly accessible what's happened with the patent trolls is they've actually abused the patent
[2:14:20.920 --> 2:14:27.000]  system now what's unfortunate about that is a big guys apple google etc have taken advantage of the
[2:14:27.000 --> 2:14:31.480]  patent trolls to say that we should completely eliminate patents which means they want to make
[2:14:31.480 --> 2:14:36.760]  a trade secret which would let the big guys such and control all types of innovation exactly my
[2:14:36.760 --> 2:14:40.840]  belief is when we go back to the heart of what the founding fathers wanted what the heart of
[2:14:40.840 --> 2:14:45.720]  freedom essentially was in innovation was that independent inventors should be incented innovate
[2:14:45.720 --> 2:14:50.520]  like that 14-year-old kid i was in newark and there's many people like that you know in fact it was
[2:14:50.520 --> 2:14:55.320]  a 14-year-old kid who invented tv took him 60 years to eventually get recognition for that
[2:14:55.320 --> 2:15:01.080]  was file at farnsworth but i think at the heart of this and the spirit of this was you have certain
[2:15:01.080 --> 2:15:06.120]  amount of protection to support independent innovation and what's really happened is that
[2:15:06.120 --> 2:15:13.640]  much of the large entities have abused this patent trolls you know and there's whole public entities
[2:15:13.640 --> 2:15:17.720]  public corporations which run patent trolls right now sure but i think at the heart of it was
[2:15:17.720 --> 2:15:22.760]  innovation was really supported to support that spirit of creativity in this country which was
[2:15:22.760 --> 2:15:27.320]  at the heart of why america is great and that's the key with everything there has to be a balance
[2:15:27.320 --> 2:15:31.000]  you know we do want to protect intellectual property but then of course there's the patent
[2:15:31.000 --> 2:15:35.880]  trolls but you didn't come at this as a patent troll you came at this because you want to protect
[2:15:35.880 --> 2:15:41.320]  your reputation and because also as you pointed out it's always the military industrial complex
[2:15:41.320 --> 2:15:46.120]  that is trying to take credit for everything and so you had this lawsuit that just recently
[2:15:46.120 --> 2:15:51.000]  got settled $750,000 lawsuit you won with gawker media tell us about that
[2:15:51.000 --> 2:15:57.000]  yes so here is the deal you know i went off to mit after 81 82 when i invented emails have
[2:15:57.000 --> 2:16:02.280]  you know between 78 81 went to mit did a bunch of degrees had a very prolific career started
[2:16:02.280 --> 2:16:08.600]  many companies made millions of dollars and other inventions in 2011 when my mom was dying of a
[2:16:08.600 --> 2:16:13.640]  horrible disease called pulmonary fibrosis in a suitcase she'd left all of this material and gave
[2:16:13.640 --> 2:16:20.280]  it to me and uh dug ameth who was a technology editor their time looked at all of this and
[2:16:20.280 --> 2:16:26.600]  then he wrote a article called the man who invented email in time magazine after that in february 16
[2:16:26.600 --> 2:16:33.960]  2012 the smithsonian invited me uh and accepted all my materials was a big honor the day it went
[2:16:33.960 --> 2:16:38.520]  into the smithsonian you know it should have been an occasion for celebration in fact of what america
[2:16:38.520 --> 2:16:44.440]  is truly about what you see is you see this backlash from the academic elitist historians
[2:16:44.440 --> 2:16:50.920]  and the cabal of the military industrial complex who in those 35 years when i had really promoted
[2:16:50.920 --> 2:16:56.040]  myself a rewritten a history that a defense contractor called ray theon and they had essentially
[2:16:56.040 --> 2:17:01.320]  created a false narrative that email came out of the military what they had done was simple text
[2:17:01.320 --> 2:17:07.160]  messaging in fact we found a document clearly showing that they had no interest to in fact invent
[2:17:07.160 --> 2:17:11.960]  email because they thought it was impossible and says you're showing ray theon had essentially
[2:17:11.960 --> 2:17:16.760]  created this huge branding so when my stuff went into the smithsonian it was like a new
[2:17:16.760 --> 2:17:21.000]  you know skull being found in africa which completely changed the origin of humans so
[2:17:21.000 --> 2:17:27.560]  they had to destroy it so you see the fake news sites like gizmodo uh gawker start calling me
[2:17:27.560 --> 2:17:32.840]  all sorts of names horrible names trying to destroy my reputation all my four degrees at
[2:17:32.840 --> 2:17:39.160]  mit everything i've done so you know in boston for example i wasn't able to find any law firm
[2:17:39.160 --> 2:17:44.520]  to take this on because many of them had links to ray theon wow when hulk hogan the beginning of
[2:17:44.520 --> 2:17:50.440]  this year one which was a you know in a jury trial a great case to charles harder represented i
[2:17:50.440 --> 2:17:56.200]  called up charles and charles took on my case 30 days after i filed gawker claimed bankruptcy and
[2:17:56.200 --> 2:18:01.720]  the irony sort of the karma of this whole thing was that i get appointed to be one of the co-chairs
[2:18:01.720 --> 2:18:07.880]  of all the unsecured creditors so it was a big victory for us because the facts were so obvious
[2:18:07.880 --> 2:18:12.840]  gawker clearly didn't want to go to the jury trial and frankly i never cared about the money anyway
[2:18:12.840 --> 2:18:18.600]  you know for me it was one principle my reputation to call someone a fraud a liar and a fake when i
[2:18:18.600 --> 2:18:24.040]  was being 100 percent truthful truthful is absolutely ridiculous you know when i i hear this
[2:18:24.040 --> 2:18:30.360]  what this reminds me of uh dr aya duray is that the struggle between langley and the right brothers
[2:18:30.360 --> 2:18:35.400]  and you're talking about how they wanted to take credit for this and of course uh the the big air
[2:18:35.400 --> 2:18:41.560]  field is not is named langley air force base not right brothers air force base langley didn't make
[2:18:41.560 --> 2:18:48.360]  any progress in terms of creating an airplane because he was using the charts and the the
[2:18:48.360 --> 2:18:53.080]  observations that people had recorded that were incorrect the right brothers looked at it and they
[2:18:53.080 --> 2:18:58.200]  said wait a minute let's go back to square one let's do our own measurements they came up with a
[2:18:58.200 --> 2:19:03.960]  system that worked he never got anything to fly and yet the government names the air force base
[2:19:03.960 --> 2:19:08.440]  after him because he was president of smithsonian he was connected within the government but you
[2:19:08.440 --> 2:19:12.680]  got a couple of homeschooled bicycle builders who are the ones who actually made the first working
[2:19:12.680 --> 2:19:18.920]  plane not the guy who was affiliated with a big military industrial complex of his day yeah and

[2:19:34.440 --> 2:19:40.120]  the military was doing these little dinky text messages yeah in fact this guy within the military
[2:19:40.120 --> 2:19:46.520]  ray tomlinson all he did was a 15 minute job to be able to attach text to a remote file rathion has

[2:24:10.120 --> 2:24:15.000]  we're talking to dr. shiva aya duray we've been talking about the fact that he was the developer
[2:24:15.560 --> 2:24:21.080]  of email the original inventor of email he was credited as such and once he was credited
[2:24:21.080 --> 2:24:26.520]  that got the establishment especially the military industrial establishment very upset
[2:24:27.080 --> 2:24:31.400]  they pushed back against him they assassinated his character and not in an effort to be some
[2:24:31.400 --> 2:24:37.480]  kind of a patent troll but simply to defend his reputation to defend his honor he sued gawker
[2:24:38.120 --> 2:24:42.760]  the parent company of the publications that came after him and he prevailed in that but
[2:24:42.760 --> 2:24:48.760]  we're also going to talk to him about his research on gmo he is a man who is an expert in wide
[2:24:48.760 --> 2:24:55.160]  wide widely different fields and the field that he is uh stayed in for the most part the field
[2:24:55.160 --> 2:25:00.760]  that he got his phd in his biology and biological engineering at mit so we're going to talk to
[2:25:00.760 --> 2:25:06.360]  about talk to him about what he's found in gmo and of course going back to this article again
[2:25:06.360 --> 2:25:12.280]  there was a not his study but a previous study researchers in egypt found that with gm soy
[2:25:12.280 --> 2:25:18.680]  genetically modified soy they had dna fragmentation increased significantly they had glyphosid
[2:25:18.680 --> 2:25:25.880]  tolerate enzymes were found in the blood and this toxicity increased at 30 60 and 90 day levels as
[2:25:25.880 --> 2:25:32.520]  they fed rats this gemat genetically modified soy they also found the kidneys biopathology
[2:25:32.520 --> 2:25:38.680]  increased they found chromosomal aberrations and these rats that they were feeding genetically
[2:25:38.680 --> 2:25:44.920]  modified soy see it matters what you put in your body it's very important and we're not saying that
[2:25:44.920 --> 2:25:51.400]  soy is bad but there's a different form of soy that is harmful as we see in this study and as
[2:25:51.400 --> 2:25:58.120]  he's going to talk to us in the research that he did that's why we try to offer you the very best

[2:26:11.320 --> 2:26:19.000]  all selenium is the same not all soy is the same gm soy is different from real real organic soy
[2:26:19.000 --> 2:26:26.520]  and gm corn is different from organic corn and organic selenium is different from synthetic
[2:26:26.520 --> 2:26:31.160]  selenium is now back in stock take a look at that at info wars life calm also look at the

[2:26:58.280 --> 2:27:05.080]  genetically modified soy and your research on that i want to finish up a little bit more on
[2:27:05.080 --> 2:27:09.720]  this email as we're going to break you were talking about the profit motivation that the
[2:27:09.720 --> 2:27:14.920]  military industrial complex was getting by claiming that they had invented email there was a
[2:27:14.920 --> 2:27:20.760]  profit motive in it as they were coming after your reputation wasn't there definitely i mean
[2:27:20.760 --> 2:27:28.840]  if you look at it you know raytheon around 2009 you know post 9 11 the large defense contractors
[2:27:28.840 --> 2:27:33.640]  many of them got involved in the cyber security business it was a lucrative business today it's
[2:27:33.640 --> 2:27:39.720]  around a 70 billion dollar industry raytheon around 2009 bought a company called bbnn which was
[2:27:39.720 --> 2:27:46.040]  really the acoustic business and they rebranded themselves as the inventors of email in fact
[2:27:46.040 --> 2:27:50.680]  seven days after i went to the smithsonian they actually created a website or not they
[2:27:50.680 --> 2:27:56.360]  but their surrogates called the internet hall of fame and they award ray tomlinson the inventor
[2:27:56.360 --> 2:28:01.720]  of email where the timing is not coincidental but the reality was the 70 billion dollar cyber
[2:28:01.720 --> 2:28:06.360]  security market was very lucrative all the major defense contractors started the cyber
[2:28:06.360 --> 2:28:11.720]  security division including raytheon and they rebranded themselves if you look at their website
[2:28:11.720 --> 2:28:16.440]  that you showed up you know they've since taken that down after we exposed this the at logo is
[2:28:16.440 --> 2:28:22.040]  almost like the nike swoosh they brand themselves as innovators and they have their mascot so when
[2:28:22.040 --> 2:28:28.120]  my stuff went into this masonian we basically was exposing their marketing myth it's almost like
[2:28:28.120 --> 2:28:32.440]  they'll imagine exposing that michael jordan did shoot all of his baskets that ray tomlinson
[2:28:32.440 --> 2:28:38.280]  didn't invent email so that was really the economic motivation to attempt to destroy my reputation
[2:28:38.280 --> 2:28:42.920]  and they use their surrogates in the academic historian community in fact when i gave my work
[2:28:42.920 --> 2:28:47.800]  to the smithsonian the agreement was they would display it for all young people in the united
[2:28:47.800 --> 2:28:53.800]  states to get inspired to this day that smithsonian has not displayed my artifacts in fact the end of
[2:28:53.800 --> 2:29:01.320]  2015 i met at last i met uh i met with the new secretary of the smithsonian david scorton
[2:29:01.320 --> 2:29:05.480]  and within 30 minutes of looking at the facts he said she bet you need to get an investigative
[2:29:05.480 --> 2:29:11.160]  journalist he wrote to the head of the national museum of american history john gray and he basically
[2:29:11.160 --> 2:29:16.120]  to his own boss he basically said we have no intention of displaying this so this is a level
[2:29:16.120 --> 2:29:21.800]  of collusion that goes on in academia academia is not doing the work that it was meant to do it
[2:29:21.800 --> 2:29:26.840]  does really the work of large corporations who funds them so this notion i think you've been
[2:29:26.840 --> 2:29:32.200]  discussing on the show if you look at the east coast elitist academics the hollywood people
[2:29:32.920 --> 2:29:37.640]  these people have this liberal ethos but they're fundamentally fascistic in many ways
[2:29:38.200 --> 2:29:42.440]  and we're going to we're going to continue with that and we're going to talk about how they use
[2:29:42.440 --> 2:29:46.200]  their position of authority to control our information we're going to come back with
[2:29:46.200 --> 2:29:51.720]  dr aya duray and we're going to talk about the biology aspect as well stay with us the empires on
[2:29:51.720 --> 2:30:02.920]  the run alex jones and the gcn radio network here is michelle obama in 2008 after her husband was
[2:30:02.920 --> 2:30:09.800]  elected what we've learned over this year is that hope is making a comeback it is making a comeback
[2:30:09.800 --> 2:30:17.480]  and let me tell you something for the first time in my adult lifetime i'm really proud of my country

[2:30:31.000 --> 2:30:37.320]  husband was in charge for eight years now here in 2017 we have no hope so according to her barrage
[2:30:37.320 --> 2:30:42.920]  legacy is the killer of hope well thank god real americans are finally feeling hope with donald trump
[2:30:42.920 --> 2:30:48.520]  the last bastion of real hope not just a catchphrase and taking this country back from the no hope

[2:33:18.760 --> 2:33:24.120]  were fired at president kennedy's motorcade and downtown dallas the first report to say
[2:33:24.120 --> 2:33:32.600]  that president kennedy has been seriously wounded by the suit it is a big idea a new world order
[2:33:35.960 --> 2:33:40.840]  it was almost as if it were a planned impulse to judge pancakes

[2:34:40.760 --> 2:34:45.320]  welcome back to the alex jones radio show i'm david night and i'm talking to dr shiva aya duray
[2:34:46.040 --> 2:34:50.920]  and as you heard the beginning of that clip there you heard president eisenhower saying in the
[2:34:50.920 --> 2:34:55.720]  council's of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought
[2:34:55.720 --> 2:35:01.400]  or unsought by the military industrial complex but of course he was also talking about universities
[2:35:01.400 --> 2:35:05.640]  a couple of paragraphs down he says today the solitary inventor and that's who we're talking
[2:35:05.640 --> 2:35:12.920]  to dr aya duray the solitary inventor hankering in his shop has been overshadowed by task forces
[2:35:12.920 --> 2:35:17.720]  of scientists and laboratories and testing fields and in the same fashion the free university
[2:35:17.720 --> 2:35:23.400]  historically the fountainhead of free ideas and scientific discovery has experienced a revolution
[2:35:23.400 --> 2:35:27.960]  and the conduct of research partly because of the huge costs involved a government contract
[2:35:27.960 --> 2:35:33.240]  becomes virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity for every old blackboard there are
[2:35:33.240 --> 2:35:38.600]  now hundreds of new electronic computers he said the prospect of domination by the nation scholars
[2:35:38.600 --> 2:35:44.600]  by federal employment project allocations the power of money is ever present and gravely
[2:35:44.600 --> 2:35:48.920]  to be regarded and so that is the fundamental thing first you see the solitary inventor like
[2:35:48.920 --> 2:35:54.440]  dr aya duray they come against him as it had already been established he was the inventor
[2:35:54.440 --> 2:36:01.880]  of email for monetary purposes but also to establish their authority because argumentation
[2:36:01.880 --> 2:36:07.160]  from authority is the key way that they control the narrative and so this is an issue not only
[2:36:07.160 --> 2:36:11.240]  about his invention but it's also an issue about the military industrial complex and i want to
[2:36:11.240 --> 2:36:17.800]  talk about his next invention here now which is his uh uh side of solve system and of course he is
[2:36:17.800 --> 2:36:22.520]  a biological engineer he has a phd in systems biology with the mit department of biological
[2:36:22.520 --> 2:36:29.640]  engineering he has four degrees he is uh he is a proficient and a wide variety of different issues
[2:36:29.640 --> 2:36:34.440]  i want to talk to him about the gmo aspect we've mentioned this and tease this uh earlier in the
[2:36:34.440 --> 2:36:40.520]  show but one of the things that uh he sent to me was he said that in 2014 he saw in the mit
[2:36:40.520 --> 2:36:49.560]  technology review a story titled by fresh by gmo and that got him thinking talk to us uh dr aya
[2:36:49.560 --> 2:36:55.160]  duray about the essence of gmo i think a lot of people really don't understand the difference
[2:36:55.160 --> 2:37:00.680]  between transgenic uh genetically modified things and things that are just selectively
[2:37:00.680 --> 2:37:07.720]  bred you know because we've had massive genetic very uh variation between let's say dog breeds
[2:37:07.720 --> 2:37:11.880]  okay just look at dogs as one example and that was done by selective breeding that something's
[2:37:11.880 --> 2:37:16.280]  been done for thousands of years but what we're talking about now is something that is fundamentally
[2:37:16.280 --> 2:37:23.400]  different transgenic can allow them to combine plants with animals it can allow them to provide
[2:37:23.400 --> 2:37:30.280]  to combine chemicals with plants or animals it's very very different uh tell us about this article
[2:37:30.280 --> 2:37:35.880]  by fresh by gmo and how that alerted you to the dangers uh that were being sold to us by academia
[2:37:35.880 --> 2:37:43.080]  yeah i think great observation by the way david so you know when i saw that article um by fresh by
[2:37:43.080 --> 2:37:49.000]  gmo you have to understand between 2003 and 2007 i went back to mit to do my phd to really create
[2:37:49.000 --> 2:37:54.840]  this new technology called cytosol which would help us really model very complex molecular pathways
[2:37:54.840 --> 2:38:01.320]  using the computer so in 2014 when i saw that frankly it was an ad this is mit's technology
[2:38:01.320 --> 2:38:07.400]  review it was an ad for gmo's and as you read through that article what you find is that there's
[2:38:07.400 --> 2:38:12.680]  this false narrative being created that the developing nations for example like africa
[2:38:12.680 --> 2:38:19.480]  india we all must have gmo's because without gmo's there's no way we're going to be able to
[2:38:19.480 --> 2:38:25.560]  produce enough food to feed the masses of the world this is sort of this narrative that goes on
[2:38:26.600 --> 2:38:30.440]  by the way you know henry kissinger pointed out that if you really want to control people it's not
[2:38:30.440 --> 2:38:38.120]  through oil but control their soil yes so mit is a part of this you know voice was really
[2:38:38.120 --> 2:38:44.040]  essentially advertising gmo's and so i said you know why don't we use cytosol which we had published
[2:38:44.040 --> 2:38:49.800]  which we had gotten all sorts of great feedback from all the major publications to really understand
[2:38:49.800 --> 2:38:54.760]  at the molecular systems level what's going on now to the audience out there to your point david
[2:38:54.760 --> 2:39:01.640]  it's a very important point a gmo is where they take a gene from let's say from a fish which has
[2:39:01.640 --> 2:39:06.920]  a certain property maybe it can withstand cold because of its skin and they transfer it let's
[2:39:06.920 --> 2:39:12.600]  say to like a tomato so this is not something that occurs in nature many of the mainstream
[2:39:12.600 --> 2:39:19.160]  publications new york times etc were essentially supporting fake news by these basically these
[2:39:19.160 --> 2:39:24.440]  bogus scientists who are trying to convince all of us oh don't worry genetic engineering or
[2:39:24.440 --> 2:39:29.000]  gmo's is no different than plant breeding or normal breeding that takes place in nature
[2:39:29.000 --> 2:39:34.280]  in normal breeding you have a full you know interaction of all the dna not just one little
[2:39:34.280 --> 2:39:40.040]  gene so this is sort of the big lie that got promoted don't worry you know genetic gmo's are
[2:39:40.040 --> 2:39:45.480]  no different than full blown breeding but the reality is what occurs with the gmo by taking a
[2:39:45.480 --> 2:39:50.840]  gene from one species and putting into another in a test tube doesn't occur in nature so that's
[2:39:50.840 --> 2:39:56.600]  what a gmo's that's what they call it genetically engineered foods or gmo's so what we said is why
[2:39:56.600 --> 2:40:01.640]  don't we really do a deep dive use cytosol this very powerful technology by the way which we've
[2:40:01.640 --> 2:40:06.360]  used to create new medicines which has been published in nature and sell inside of there
[2:40:06.360 --> 2:40:12.600]  why don't we use this to understand what is going on so what we did was we said there have been some
[2:40:12.600 --> 2:40:17.720]  reports by some farmers in the midwest saying that they had seen higher levels of formaldehyde
[2:40:17.720 --> 2:40:23.000]  and gmo corn no one was able to understand the mechanism so the traditional conventional
[2:40:23.000 --> 2:40:29.240]  academic sort of poo poo did so what we did was we said why would that occur so it turns out in
[2:40:29.240 --> 2:40:37.320]  all plants all fungi and all bacteria there's a core molecular system called c1 metabolism to
[2:40:37.320 --> 2:40:44.040]  keep it simple plants for example take sunlight and they put together carbon to you know create
[2:40:44.040 --> 2:40:53.000]  what's called carbon metabolism that c1 metabolism pathway we went through nearly 11000 papers
[2:40:53.640 --> 2:40:59.800]  across 6000 research results using cytosol we were able to combine all that and extract that
[2:41:00.360 --> 2:41:05.400]  and we found the major molecular pathways of c1 that was published in paper one very
[2:41:06.600 --> 2:41:12.600]  you know humbly we published that and let's add let's add here briefly this is peer reviewed
[2:41:12.600 --> 2:41:16.280]  so these are peer reviewed papers that have come through here that's very important for
[2:41:16.280 --> 2:41:23.240]  the scientists to understand that and open access you see the old model of publishing
[2:41:23.240 --> 2:41:28.520]  has been a little old boys network where in the major journals like nature in fact randy
[2:41:28.520 --> 2:41:33.160]  shekman who won the Nobel prize he's come out against the big journals saying it's an internal
[2:41:33.160 --> 2:41:39.880]  cabal of who gets to publish so but we went to open access journals which is you have peer view
[2:41:39.880 --> 2:41:45.080]  but it goes directly to the masses and you don't have to pay a fee to download so we published
[2:41:45.080 --> 2:41:49.400]  that first paper next and let me let me add one other thing too because that also parallels what
[2:41:49.400 --> 2:41:53.560]  we've seen with the internet and with news you know one of the ways that you can control control
[2:41:53.560 --> 2:41:58.600]  the narrative and we saw this when there were only a few networks out there just you're talking about
[2:41:58.600 --> 2:42:03.960]  we had a parallel structure and the peer reviewed journals you've just got a few publishers and what
[2:42:03.960 --> 2:42:09.160]  they choose to report and what they choose not to report can be a form of censorship and so you
[2:42:09.160 --> 2:42:14.360]  were able to transcend that by going open source going directly to the public but still having it
[2:42:14.360 --> 2:42:19.800]  be peer reviewed yeah in fact you know the story for example einstein never published any papers
[2:42:19.800 --> 2:42:24.360]  peer review he thought the whole concept peer review was ridiculous because if you're an innovator
[2:42:24.360 --> 2:42:29.080]  publishing something new how can a peer even review that he thought that it should go direct
[2:42:29.080 --> 2:42:34.680]  and let people make the decisions yeah so in fact when he put one of his last papers they
[2:42:34.680 --> 2:42:39.720]  said they wanted a peer review and he said give it back to me so this whole notion of peer review
[2:42:39.720 --> 2:42:45.480]  has been created in some ways by the priesthood to control knowledge and they branded as though
[2:42:45.480 --> 2:42:51.160]  they're the only ones who can decide for us who should read what I agree and that's why I put that
[2:42:51.160 --> 2:42:54.520]  out there because we have that priesthood every time we'll talk about something well was that peer
[2:42:54.520 --> 2:42:58.520]  reviewed was that not peer reviewed and it's like okay in this in this situation they were peer
[2:42:58.520 --> 2:43:03.000]  reviewed so there you go so let's move forward yeah I published in peer reviewed I have you know
[2:43:03.000 --> 2:43:08.760]  those credentials but the reality is this whole assumption is based on the average person is
[2:43:08.760 --> 2:43:13.320]  stupid and we're going to tell you what you should even read yeah but that's it's a bigger
[2:43:13.320 --> 2:43:18.840]  discussion but anyway we published the first paper the second paper we literally took these
[2:43:18.840 --> 2:43:23.400]  molecular pathways that we've discovered from the literature which people had done in experiments
[2:43:23.400 --> 2:43:29.080]  and we converted them to mathematical models using cytosol and we interconnected them that
[2:43:29.080 --> 2:43:34.440]  was papers two and three and we showed there was in the normal condition for all plants
[2:43:34.440 --> 2:43:43.960]  that they normally you know process carbon by a pathway where they do create formaldehyde
[2:43:43.960 --> 2:43:50.360]  it's called a methionine and methylation pathway but then they detoxify it so in the normal case
[2:43:50.360 --> 2:43:56.360]  all plants do create a little bit of formaldehyde but they detoxify it however what we found was
[2:43:56.360 --> 2:44:02.760]  under certain stressful conditions pollution or when there's a drought a plant will actually
[2:44:02.760 --> 2:44:07.240]  deplete its glutathione I noticed in your commercial you talked about selenium selenium
[2:44:07.240 --> 2:44:13.160]  is an amazing mineral which actually helps you know it's a precursor to glutathione glutathione
[2:44:13.160 --> 2:44:18.280]  is a very important antioxidant which helps breaks down formaldehyde so what we found is
[2:44:18.280 --> 2:44:24.680]  in normal plants plants do create formaldehyde they have enough glutathione to make sure formaldehyde
[2:44:24.680 --> 2:44:31.640]  is detoxified however under stressful conditions the glutathione gets depleted and format formaldehyde
[2:44:31.640 --> 2:44:36.680]  accumulate so those were papers two and three in the fourth paper what we did was we looked at gmo
[2:44:36.680 --> 2:44:43.960]  soy I think the point you made is important not all soy is equal 97% of the soy in the United States
[2:44:43.960 --> 2:44:50.920]  is genetically engineered Monsanto created a version of gmo soy called roundup ready soy
[2:44:50.920 --> 2:44:56.920]  it's a version of soy which can withstand their own pesticide called glyphosate or roundup
[2:44:57.720 --> 2:45:02.920]  so when you plant one of their seeds their seed can also withstand their own pesticide
[2:45:02.920 --> 2:45:08.280]  that's called roundup ready soy what we found out in roundup ready soy by the way they the way
[2:45:08.280 --> 2:45:14.280]  they created roundup ready soy was they took a gene from a different bacterium and they shoved it
[2:45:14.280 --> 2:45:20.920]  into the soy seed in the normal soy seed and that let it create another immune system to withstand
[2:45:20.920 --> 2:45:27.160]  their own roundup so anyway what we found was when they inserted that that new gene it actually
[2:45:27.160 --> 2:45:33.560]  perturbs the entire C1 metabolic metabolic system and puts the plant into what's called oxidative
[2:45:33.560 --> 2:45:39.880]  stress the plant actually thinks it's under stress it depletes his glutathione and formaldehyde
[2:45:39.880 --> 2:45:44.520]  accumulates that was paper number four when we published this we were attacked by the pro Monsanto
[2:45:44.520 --> 2:45:50.760]  stargates including a guy called kevin folta who was the head of agriculture uh the head of the
[2:45:50.760 --> 2:45:55.400]  horticultural student university of florida part of the priesthood he said by the way this guy didn't
[2:45:55.400 --> 2:46:00.440]  create email and furthermore his research is just a model and he also said i have nothing to do with
[2:46:00.440 --> 2:46:06.280]  Monsanto as some of your viewers may know subsequent to saying that a foyer was issued on him by a
[2:46:06.280 --> 2:46:12.680]  non-profit group in the west coast 4 000 emails came out with a clear email from Monsanto to him
[2:46:12.680 --> 2:46:17.800]  giving him 25 000 dollars to be their spokesman so there you go you got him with your own invention
[2:46:17.800 --> 2:46:22.680]  email exactly four thousand emails between him and Monsanto showing that there was a connection
[2:46:22.680 --> 2:46:28.760]  besides the 25 000 dollars that they uh that they gave him so yeah so folta's been exposed
[2:46:28.760 --> 2:46:34.280]  and so it's funny the ironies emails a tool that was used to expose him now more recently the end
[2:46:34.280 --> 2:46:40.040]  of last year we published a fifth paper because people like the folters were saying oh this is
[2:46:40.040 --> 2:46:47.640]  just a mathematical model we went back in and we actually did focus on glutathione and we were able
[2:46:47.640 --> 2:46:55.480]  to show that glutathione levels are nearly 300 less in the gml soy not only that we found research
[2:46:55.480 --> 2:47:02.040]  that was done three years ago uh four years ago in 2011 but uh a little bit longer than that in leads
[2:47:02.040 --> 2:47:09.240]  and duplicated in leads by researchers who had actually grown the gmo and non-gmo soy in the
[2:47:09.240 --> 2:47:16.200]  greenhouse and they too had found in the actual live plant 300 less glutathione so what we're saying
[2:47:16.200 --> 2:47:22.440]  is we've been sort of told all these plants are much more resistant to drought etc but it's actually
[2:47:22.440 --> 2:47:30.120]  completely false what we're finding is that the gmo soy has 300 less glutathione let me tell you
[2:47:30.120 --> 2:47:37.480]  glutathione is one of the most important antioxidants for for cleaning up detoxifying our body so
[2:47:37.480 --> 2:47:43.160]  if the soy has one third less you can imagine what that means to the nutrient value it gets even
[2:47:43.160 --> 2:47:50.440]  more interesting glutathione our view is because it's less than the soy even the soy's immune
[2:47:50.440 --> 2:47:55.400]  system is lowered that's why many of the gmo seeds they're coating them with a thing called
[2:47:55.400 --> 2:48:02.040]  neonicotinoids which is a coating which protects the seed from soil organisms so what you're seeing
[2:48:02.040 --> 2:48:09.240]  is the entire process of creating gmo's has completely screwing around with nature so not
[2:48:09.240 --> 2:48:15.640]  only do they have created a an organism which is less stronger and then they have to coat it with
[2:48:15.640 --> 2:48:20.200]  another pesticide it's kind of like the laws that the government does they they create a problem
[2:48:20.200 --> 2:48:24.600]  that makes us more vulnerable and then what they do is they double down with that with more laws
[2:48:24.600 --> 2:48:28.520]  that make us even further vulnerable and i think it's interesting when we look at monsanto you're
[2:48:28.520 --> 2:48:33.560]  talking about how they start to go down this path where you began on all this you said they're selling
[2:48:33.560 --> 2:48:39.560]  us gmo saying that's the only way that we can feed the population of the planet and yet it's
[2:48:39.560 --> 2:48:45.400]  monsanto that creates these seeds that you have to keep buying from them because they won't self
[2:48:45.400 --> 2:48:52.120]  replicate so they're actually creating a situation that would and that would hinder our food supply
[2:48:52.120 --> 2:48:58.920]  for their own profits aren't they exactly i mean this entire process you know is a very insidious
[2:48:58.920 --> 2:49:04.920]  process yeah and the biggest so-called respectable people from the gates foundation the big academics
[2:49:04.920 --> 2:49:11.480]  are all behind this right so you know you go to a place like africa and india you show bloated babies
[2:49:11.480 --> 2:49:17.320]  and then you convince everyone they need you know help from it's a neo-missionary attitude so we've
[2:49:17.320 --> 2:49:22.440]  got into these developing nations destroyed their soil giving them sort of uni-dimensional types of
[2:49:22.440 --> 2:49:28.840]  crops wheat and corn and many of these countries had their own biodiversity and then we forced them
[2:49:28.840 --> 2:49:34.760]  to buy gmo seeds because that's a new market for monsanto and as a part of that we're selling the gmo
[2:49:34.760 --> 2:49:41.640]  seeds as well as the pesticides and that's really at the crux of why there's a lot of these issues
[2:49:41.640 --> 2:49:46.040]  in public health in in all of these countries including our health in fact two days ago a paper
[2:49:46.040 --> 2:49:53.320]  just came out in nature showing that low levels of glyphosate roundup cause you know fatty liver
[2:49:53.960 --> 2:49:59.960]  you know eeg obesity etc this just came out in nature so at the foundation of all of this when
[2:49:59.960 --> 2:50:04.920]  you go back to where i grew up in india my grandmother was a traditional farmer a healer
[2:50:04.920 --> 2:50:10.280]  traditional systems of health and nutrition were really based on using our food supply
[2:50:10.280 --> 2:50:15.640]  natural systems natural herbs to support us and what we've done is through the military industrial
[2:50:15.640 --> 2:50:22.040]  complex monsanto and dal for example as you may know and they're the ones who created agent orange
[2:50:22.040 --> 2:50:27.720]  which was to defoliate vietnam's they took that entire infrastructure and reused it for delivery
[2:50:27.720 --> 2:50:33.560]  of roundup and glyphosate on factory farms so the military industrial complex and their industries
[2:50:33.560 --> 2:50:39.400]  thrive on reusing the technologies they created for war in their secondary markets back in civilian
[2:50:39.400 --> 2:50:43.880]  life that's why something like the invention of email as you're showing this slide perturbs this
[2:50:43.880 --> 2:50:48.520]  entire entire narrative because the narrative is the golden triangle of the military industrial
[2:50:48.520 --> 2:50:52.440]  complex as well all great innovation comes from that's right they want to bow down to that
[2:50:52.440 --> 2:50:56.120]  and that's why they wanted to discredit you stay with us we're going to be right back with dr
[2:50:56.120 --> 2:51:03.000]  aya duray often not valid in all states are were prohibited by law see website for details
[2:51:03.000 --> 2:51:08.600]  need some extra cash today do you have bad credit or maxed out credit cards if so turn your radio
[2:51:08.600 --> 2:51:14.440]  up 45 cash dot com is one of the nation's largest personal loan networks with over 50 different lenders

[2:54:15.320 --> 2:54:19.160]  welcome back to the alex joneshow i'm david nighting we're talking to dr ioduray
[2:54:19.160 --> 2:54:26.040]  the battle for an email and exposure of what's going on with genetically modified soy and with
[2:54:26.040 --> 2:54:31.160]  other issues and of course because of that he was attacked they tried to destroy his reputation
[2:54:31.160 --> 2:54:36.280]  because if they could destroy his reputation they don't have to address his research that
[2:54:36.280 --> 2:54:42.920]  showed the harmful effects on plants on the soy of the of gmo the fact that it accumulated
[2:54:42.920 --> 2:54:46.840]  formaldehyde which is a known carcinogen something we should be very concerned about
[2:54:46.840 --> 2:54:53.880]  and of course the key mechanism they identified was the drop in glutathione and as he pointed
[2:54:53.880 --> 2:54:59.000]  out when he's talking about this selenium is a key building block in creating glutathione so it's
[2:54:59.000 --> 2:55:02.760]  something that is very essential that's why you have these studies you can look at the mechanism
[2:55:02.760 --> 2:55:07.240]  or you can just look at the studies that show that you need selenium for your health in terms of your
[2:55:07.240 --> 2:55:12.360]  thyroid gland your immune system your dna production your eyesight we now have bio true selenium back
[2:55:12.360 --> 2:55:19.160]  in stock we make our selenium from a 100 organic mustard seed it's not synthetic selenium and as
[2:55:19.160 --> 2:55:24.440]  we pointed out earlier there's a difference between the three percent of soy that is not
[2:55:24.440 --> 2:55:29.320]  genetically modified and the 97 percent that is genetically modified there's a big difference
[2:55:29.320 --> 2:55:34.440]  and there's a big difference in the selenium that you get as well so you should understand
[2:55:34.440 --> 2:55:39.480]  not only what things you need that are essential in terms of trace minerals and other nutrients
[2:55:39.480 --> 2:55:45.480]  but you should also take a close look at how these things what you know how they're made
[2:55:45.480 --> 2:55:50.520]  so that you get a pure form of it the best form that you can find so we now have bio true selenium

[2:56:28.360 --> 2:56:33.560]  what we've been talking about and of course you as you point out we talk about glyphosate and
[2:56:33.560 --> 2:56:39.560]  monsanto they genetically engineer and they created these problems with the accumulation
[2:56:39.560 --> 2:56:44.760]  of formaldehyde because they've created soy that is not going to be affected by their
[2:56:46.040 --> 2:56:53.800]  by their glyphosate okay which is a weed killer but when they spray this indiscriminately then
[2:56:53.800 --> 2:56:58.040]  this can go over and kill people even with people are trying to do something that is organic
[2:56:58.040 --> 2:57:01.720]  their plants are susceptible to this because they haven't been genetically modified they're
[2:57:01.720 --> 2:57:07.400]  susceptible to being killed by this so we've seen this kind of damage that has been spread by this
[2:57:07.400 --> 2:57:12.440]  and of course i'm sure you're aware of what's going on in india farmers become indebted to
[2:57:12.440 --> 2:57:18.440]  monsanto because they start buying a gmo seed and then that seed does not reproduce they turn
[2:57:18.440 --> 2:57:22.760]  into debtors they've had massive numbers of suicides in india speak to some of that force
[2:57:23.960 --> 2:57:27.320]  yeah i mean i think it's an i think you're bringing up some very good points david it's an
[2:57:27.320 --> 2:57:32.360]  insidious cycle right so yes what they've done with the gmo seeds is they've made it into almost
[2:57:32.360 --> 2:57:38.920]  like a software licensing model right so if you and i are both farmers let's say you're next door
[2:57:38.920 --> 2:57:46.200]  to me and you're not using monsanto's gmo soy and i am um let's say for example one of my seeds
[2:57:46.200 --> 2:57:53.080]  happens to fly over onto your property monsanto will unleash their legal apparatus to force you
[2:57:53.080 --> 2:58:00.280]  to now license their seeds yeah and in fact you can be you know um litigated against and in fact
[2:58:00.280 --> 2:58:05.560]  suffered massive fines in india what's happened you know with these you know in india a small farmer
[2:58:05.560 --> 2:58:11.880]  may have many kids his entire livelihood is based on farming his plot of land so in countries like
[2:58:11.880 --> 2:58:19.080]  india many of these gmo producers have essentially experimented with gmo seeds some of them work some
[2:58:19.080 --> 2:58:24.280]  of them quote unquote work some of them don't and these farmers become indebted to them and the
[2:58:24.280 --> 2:58:29.000]  licensing model as you said is every year annually you have to come up with more money hang on we're
[2:58:29.000 --> 2:58:32.120]  going to continue with that right after the break we've got a short segment here but we're going to
[2:58:32.120 --> 2:58:42.120]  continue with dr aya duray right after the break we'll be right back thank you for listening to gcm

[3:00:03.400 --> 3:00:06.040]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:00:11.560 --> 3:00:15.480]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david nighting we have one more segment with dr
[3:00:15.480 --> 3:00:20.440]  iya duray it's been very interesting talking to you doctor you mentioned something as we're going
[3:00:20.440 --> 3:00:25.960]  to break and that was how monsanto was going to essentially a software licensing model where people
[3:00:25.960 --> 3:00:30.840]  would have to continually re-up and continue to buy their seeds every year and we've seen this even
[3:00:30.840 --> 3:00:35.080]  from car manufacturers truck manufacturers i remember reporting on this about a year so ago
[3:00:35.080 --> 3:00:40.760]  under the digital millennial copyright act they said we own the software that runs your car so
[3:00:40.760 --> 3:00:45.560]  you farmers who are used to working on your trucks you can't do that anymore we're not we own that
[3:00:45.560 --> 3:00:49.480]  and you can't modify that or even work on it in your own way of course now they're going further
[3:00:49.480 --> 3:00:53.160]  down the road they're they're coming out with the autonomous self-driving cars which are not even
[3:00:53.160 --> 3:00:57.240]  interested in saying that they're nominally going to sell to you they're turning everything
[3:00:57.240 --> 3:01:01.560]  into a renting model they want to make renters out of all of us we've seen this
[3:01:01.560 --> 3:01:07.400]  with the international monetary fund and and this is what they have been doing for a long time
[3:01:07.400 --> 3:01:11.800]  this is the model that they want they want everyone to become their surf to become their
[3:01:11.800 --> 3:01:17.560]  renters and nowhere is this more clear than in the way monsanto has used these seeds against
[3:01:17.560 --> 3:01:21.480]  farmers in india continue on with what you're saying about the software licensing model that's
[3:01:21.480 --> 3:01:26.760]  very important for people to understand it's a sharecropper model right you basically want to
[3:01:26.760 --> 3:01:33.720]  make people become essentially slaves um and it's a model that's essentially anti-american
[3:01:33.720 --> 3:01:39.240]  because in many ways it's monopolistic at its deep deep core that basically forces people
[3:01:40.120 --> 3:01:43.960]  where they're essentially selling their land whether they know it or not in an indirect
[3:01:43.960 --> 3:01:49.160]  but direct way to organizations like monsanto and this is again i get back to that point
[3:01:49.160 --> 3:01:54.040]  when kissinger said it if you want to control nations you don't need to control oil but control
[3:01:54.040 --> 3:01:59.800]  the soil and that is fundamentally what these organizations are doing and at the heart of it
[3:01:59.800 --> 3:02:06.840]  if you go back to the core of this you know you have you know so-called intellectual liberal
[3:02:06.840 --> 3:02:13.960]  elites like hillary clinton barack obama who has allowed people like for example michael taylor
[3:02:13.960 --> 3:02:19.640]  is a former head of science policy at monsanto to be appointed deputy director of the fda where
[3:02:19.640 --> 3:02:25.320]  they have put in together policies which has allowed uh the monsanto's of the world essentially
[3:02:25.320 --> 3:02:31.080]  control this entire process and yet these same people what the irony of it is these same people
[3:02:31.080 --> 3:02:35.960]  have the gall to promote themselves as liberal intellectuals who care for all of us and i'm
[3:02:35.960 --> 3:02:41.560]  so disgusted by this because for me having been at mit in and out of there for 33 years you know
[3:02:41.560 --> 3:02:46.280]  i'm sort of an insider in some sense and like donald trump says he you know how he knows how
[3:02:46.280 --> 3:02:51.880]  wall street operates i know how academia operates it's all about control many of these academics
[3:02:51.880 --> 3:02:57.240]  really do not even care about profit they care about controlling narratives so in this model
[3:02:57.240 --> 3:03:02.840]  the narrative to control as we saw in that mit article is that everyone must need gmo so they
[3:03:02.840 --> 3:03:08.280]  create that narrative which perpetuates into organizations like monsanto essentially feeds
[3:03:08.280 --> 3:03:13.160]  their marketing engine yeah and that's the whole essence is that the fact that they hide this
[3:03:13.160 --> 3:03:17.560]  that it is very dark very subtle they hide this information just the way they hide it from the
[3:03:17.560 --> 3:03:21.880]  farmers these farmers didn't know they were going to get hooked into a sharecropper model with
[3:03:21.880 --> 3:03:26.200]  monsanto they ultimately wind up in massive numbers committing suicide when they find out how
[3:03:26.200 --> 3:03:31.480]  bad it's become and they had the dark act where they said we're tired of fighting these battles
[3:03:32.360 --> 3:03:35.960]  that are developing at the local and state level where people want to know what's in their food
[3:03:35.960 --> 3:03:40.120]  they want to know if it's gmo and they don't even want that to happen and they take it to the
[3:03:40.120 --> 3:03:44.920]  federal level to say we're going to shut down all local and state laws we're going to hide this
[3:03:44.920 --> 3:03:51.320]  from people that's the essence if we can shine the light on it that's the key exactly and what's
[3:03:51.320 --> 3:03:56.040]  interesting what you said with the dark act is some of the so-called liberal elites of the
[3:03:56.040 --> 3:04:03.160]  organic movement actually sold out the non-gmo movement they actually collaborated with the
[3:04:03.160 --> 3:04:11.160]  politicians and lobbyists in washington to make the non-gmo the gmo labeling so difficult for
[3:04:11.160 --> 3:04:16.440]  ordinary people by making it a qr code where you needed a smartphone well not every average american
[3:04:16.440 --> 3:04:23.640]  has a smartphone so over and over and over again you see this hypocrisy of the liberal academics
[3:04:23.640 --> 3:04:28.840]  claiming they care for minorities and ordinary people when in fact their entire process is actually
[3:04:28.840 --> 3:04:35.320]  subvert the entire process of truth and science and to essentially promote these very very false
[3:04:35.320 --> 3:04:41.080]  narratives and fake news beat on e-mail or beat on gmo as we're seeing right now i know you guys
[3:04:41.080 --> 3:04:46.440]  have heard it on the russian hacking they they they thrive on the misinformation they thrive on
[3:04:46.440 --> 3:04:51.640]  hiding it thank you so much dr. aya duray and i think it is amazing the irony as you point out
[3:04:51.640 --> 3:04:57.960]  that the guy who tried to destroy you was exposed by email which you invented and we now know that
[3:04:57.960 --> 3:05:02.200]  thank you so much for joining us leon mackinill be right back sharp and promised there were protesters
[3:05:02.200 --> 3:05:08.440]  at jeff sessions hearing today chanting no racist no kkk meanwhile sessions was speaking inside to
[3:05:08.440 --> 3:05:13.000]  the importance of civil rights the man fought for civil rights and desegregation in the south
[3:05:13.000 --> 3:05:18.280]  for years more than most attorneys at the time and people are outside protesting his racism
[3:05:18.280 --> 3:05:23.160]  multiple protesters made it inside and were arrested the adults inside were also discussing
[3:05:23.160 --> 3:05:28.040]  law enforcement which sessions says he supports a drug epidemic which sessions said he would fight
[3:05:28.040 --> 3:05:31.880]  the clinton email server and the clinton foundation were brought up and sessions said if
[3:05:31.880 --> 3:05:37.320]  these cases reached his desk he would recuse himself as unfit to be impartial diane feinstein
[3:05:37.320 --> 3:05:41.480]  decided to bring up the importance of the rovers weight decision and how important it is to make
[3:05:41.480 --> 3:05:47.000]  sure abortions are available so fearing all those babies might be saved feinstein asked sessions if
[3:05:47.000 --> 3:05:51.880]  he would respect that decision sessions said he disagreed with the law but respects it as law so
[3:05:51.880 --> 3:05:57.080]  jeff sessions will be the attorney general the protests have failed again this is owin shroyer

[3:08:37.800 --> 3:08:43.400]  welcome back to the fourth hour of the alex jones show owin shroyer joined by lian macadoo and we've
[3:08:43.400 --> 3:08:51.000]  got more news to cover throughout the rest of today's broadcast but alex jones has responded to the
[3:08:51.000 --> 3:08:58.760]  advice documentary that was just shot on him here's his response video i refuse most newspaper
[3:08:58.760 --> 3:09:03.960]  interviews most magazine interviews and most national tv interviews because i've done nightline
[3:09:03.960 --> 3:09:10.520]  i've done cnn fox hbo discovery channel i've done it all over and over again there have been a few
[3:09:10.520 --> 3:09:14.920]  discovery channel and history channel shows i've done where i basically host them and i'm the main
[3:09:14.920 --> 3:09:19.560]  narrator throughout the program and i was able to do those because those did have scripts
[3:09:19.560 --> 3:09:24.600]  and so i could basically pre-approved them i could i could pre-approved the questions i
[3:09:24.600 --> 3:09:28.520]  was going to be asked and then i have the authorization to give the answers i wanted
[3:09:29.240 --> 3:09:35.880]  and knew that it wouldn't be edited in a major or substantive way the problem is is that most
[3:09:35.880 --> 3:09:43.480]  companies refuse to do that deal with me so i just refuse to be part of their shows now in the case
[3:09:43.480 --> 3:09:48.760]  of vice uh there wasn't a script of questions because obviously it's a news program and i knew
[3:09:48.760 --> 3:09:53.800]  that the host was one of the more libertarian individuals on vice and he done some good work
[3:09:53.800 --> 3:09:58.760]  in the past so i said listen i figure it's a hit piece but you can come on down and when he got
[3:09:58.760 --> 3:10:04.040]  there he basically admitted to me uh that he is a libertarian but he disagrees with some of what i
[3:10:04.040 --> 3:10:09.480]  stand for him but that indeed you know if this wasn't somewhat of a hit piece you probably wouldn't
[3:10:09.480 --> 3:10:14.520]  get on air and i said well that's what i figured whatever let's just do it because i know Gavin
[3:10:14.520 --> 3:10:18.840]  McGinnis one of the founders of vice i used to like vice i've really seen it go downhill and it's
[3:10:18.840 --> 3:10:23.960]  production quality like everybody else has since hp o bought it but that's that's just the way it is
[3:10:25.160 --> 3:10:30.200]  so i sit there and i waste hours being interviewed and hours being followed around at the office
[3:10:30.200 --> 3:10:35.240]  that day they're up there until like seven thirty at night and then they air a five and a half minute
[3:10:35.240 --> 3:10:42.600]  piece on vice news about getting your news from the fringe well something isn't the fringe by
[3:10:42.600 --> 3:10:48.600]  definition if it's dominating and if it has higher ratings than a lot of mainstream news
[3:10:48.600 --> 3:10:56.680]  which they admit in the piece so so so yeah it was actually fair in some ways but then he did
[3:10:56.680 --> 3:11:03.080]  this perry mason moment thing repeatedly and i said oh i see what you're doing he he he wanted
[3:11:03.080 --> 3:11:09.080]  to have this gotcha moment where he would say something like oh you have this graph here on
[3:11:09.080 --> 3:11:15.960]  your board saying russian state run media is trusted and i say yes and then it cuts to him
[3:11:15.960 --> 3:11:23.560]  going are you effing kidding me are you serious like he's carl the cuck or something when what i
[3:11:23.560 --> 3:11:31.960]  really said was yes it says it's amongst the most trusted of state run media on this graph
[3:11:31.960 --> 3:11:39.720]  but this is not my graph all we did was invert the mainstream media graph that they'd created
[3:11:41.640 --> 3:11:46.040]  and to plan for the public that all they did was basically stack some names on one side
[3:11:46.040 --> 3:11:50.200]  and other names on the other and it was all just according to who was pro establishment it was
[3:11:50.200 --> 3:11:55.560]  anti-establishment and the whole thing was deceptive and so i went on to explain that the
[3:11:55.560 --> 3:12:01.000]  graph on the wall was one that we've drawn on the wall before we actually created one with photoshop
[3:12:01.000 --> 3:12:08.200]  to to to to bring out this point and anybody listening remembers whenever i you know actually
[3:12:08.200 --> 3:12:13.080]  did break that graph down and explain that it wasn't totally accurate because all we'd done was flip
[3:12:13.080 --> 3:12:18.200]  what they'd done but see that wasn't in there it just cut to me going yes russia is the most
[3:12:18.200 --> 3:12:26.520]  trusted media and he goes are you effing kidding me so he then goes on to say alex you know doesn't
[3:12:26.520 --> 3:12:33.160]  just have a reality problem here he's got it in other places so at key parts they had to
[3:12:33.160 --> 3:12:41.960]  twist or manufacture what i said to misrepresent it to the public and this is the essence of what
[3:12:41.960 --> 3:12:49.400]  these people do over and over and over again and so now it might be a year or two again until
[3:12:49.400 --> 3:12:53.880]  that msm into the building and then go through the same thing over and over again because all
[3:12:53.880 --> 3:12:59.080]  they do is they come to act like they've interviewed you whether it's a newspaper or magazine or tv
[3:12:59.800 --> 3:13:06.360]  to then distort things and then to pretend that they're journalists so that's what they did here
[3:13:07.400 --> 3:13:12.520]  and it's ridiculous also they show one of our youtube channels and that admit were bigger than
[3:13:12.520 --> 3:13:17.800]  nbc and a bunch of other major channels that's one of our youtube channels i showed him the others
[3:13:17.800 --> 3:13:23.640]  i showed him billions more views showing we're number one he didn't put that in there so they
[3:13:23.640 --> 3:13:28.520]  also played down how big we are still admitting we're bigger than almost everybody else so again
[3:13:28.520 --> 3:13:33.880]  it isn't about who's big just to be big if we were stupid disney stuff it wouldn't matter
[3:13:33.880 --> 3:13:38.360]  we're hardcore we're telling the truth we're a shoestring budget at austin texas and we're
[3:13:38.360 --> 3:13:44.920]  defeating goliath that's the big news we don't need you i don't need fox news i don't need cnn i
[3:13:44.920 --> 3:13:49.480]  don't need vice i don't need any of you and i'm sick of you and by the way none of us need you
[3:13:49.480 --> 3:13:54.840]  and the answer is just tune out of all of it folks or watch it for entertainment and laugh at it
[3:13:54.840 --> 3:14:00.520]  and critique it and keep me honest as well but the point is these people are a joke and it's why
[3:14:00.520 --> 3:14:06.280]  they want to censor us and label us as fake hoping everybody comes back to them you guys collapse
[3:14:06.280 --> 3:14:12.440]  because people know you're fake and this piece wasn't on a scale of one to ten the most fake
[3:14:12.440 --> 3:14:17.720]  let's say you know one being the most truthful a ten being completely lies a lot like say cnn
[3:14:17.720 --> 3:14:23.240]  i mean i'd say it was about a five because a lot of it was true but a lot of it was bull
[3:14:23.240 --> 3:14:27.800]  which which which is rare i mean i mean i'll be honest i did the interview because this guy's
[3:14:27.800 --> 3:14:33.080]  done some pretty good pieces in the past it's pretty funny so but he pulled the perry mason
[3:14:33.080 --> 3:14:39.000]  moments he pulled those big time here's a few of the clips alex jones is probably america's best
[3:14:39.000 --> 3:14:44.680]  known and most influential conspiracy theorist jones's radio program and online television
[3:14:44.680 --> 3:14:49.960]  network reaches millions the frothing rance claiming the sandy hook massacre was a hoax and
[3:14:49.960 --> 3:14:56.120]  at 9 11 was an inside job on a conference room whiteboard his staff had mapped out media organizations
[3:14:56.120 --> 3:15:01.480]  they believe are enemies of freedom i noticed that you've been most free and independent
[3:15:01.480 --> 3:15:07.400]  is oddly enough you yes um how did you do you know how we got here uh you know i was just saying
[3:15:08.520 --> 3:15:12.360]  news to advise before it was owned by the big wigs would be kind of more over here but now
[3:15:12.360 --> 3:15:17.640]  it's kind of the middle so just i just want to be um clear the advice is here on the tyranny
[3:15:17.640 --> 3:15:23.560]  and freedom but these two who are owned by the kremlin are more free than than the media
[3:15:23.560 --> 3:15:27.000]  organization you're talking about well no no no they're up at the top of state run but but they're
[3:15:27.000 --> 3:15:31.960]  also closer to the freedom yeah i mean i found their stuff to be more more uh but based in reality
[3:15:31.960 --> 3:15:37.720]  are you serious donald trump you know knew who i was knew what i was doing talk to him some of
[3:15:37.720 --> 3:15:41.800]  him in there but the whole place it's not about me i'm just pointing out the movement that was
[3:15:41.800 --> 3:15:47.160]  already there that he basically surfed in on but you're the loudest person talking about you're
[3:15:47.160 --> 3:15:52.840]  the most successful person talking bigger waves are coming we don't rise and fall with trump now
[3:15:52.840 --> 3:16:03.080]  you're gonna see the next wave good luck with that what is it what is that guy's name from vice
[3:16:03.080 --> 3:16:08.600]  that shot that what is his name i i i honestly don't know his name but but honestly that is what
[3:16:08.600 --> 3:16:13.240]  carl the cuck is going to look like in in 40 years or whatever it is i'm sorry i'm not even
[3:16:13.240 --> 3:16:17.320]  dissing the guy whatever like he's fine anything but uh he that's what carl the cuck is going to
[3:16:17.320 --> 3:16:22.120]  look like so there's alex jones response to the vice documentary i'm sure you can go check that out
[3:16:22.120 --> 3:16:27.960]  for yourself uh we've got some other news to cover here now this is something uh that that turkey
[3:16:27.960 --> 3:16:35.240]  has actually done before leon but they continue to harp this turkey a nato ally continues to accuse
[3:16:35.240 --> 3:16:40.360]  the us of supporting isis and of course this is a urdogan has repeatedly accused its nato
[3:16:40.360 --> 3:16:44.760]  ally the united states of supporting the islamic state we've documented this we know just how they
[3:16:44.760 --> 3:16:50.680]  did it um they called them moderate rebels it's really isis they say they want to take down the
[3:16:50.680 --> 3:16:57.160]  dictator Assad so they armed the moderate rebels but it's really isis here there um now you look
[3:16:57.160 --> 3:17:01.480]  at some of the stuff they're saying the turkish president said it's very clear we have confirmed
[3:17:01.480 --> 3:17:06.360]  evidence with pictures photos and videos well yeah i've seen them too actually isis is bragging
[3:17:06.360 --> 3:17:11.320]  about this and then you've got the state department spokesman mark toner responded uh he says they're
[3:17:11.320 --> 3:17:16.680]  ludicrous of course but you'll notice he goes on in the statement and instead of saying they're
[3:17:16.680 --> 3:17:24.040]  supporting isis he says daish so they're continuing this this word play isis isle uh they use taliban
[3:17:24.040 --> 3:17:27.080]  again today i think when they're referring to iraq so there's all these different things he
[3:17:27.080 --> 3:17:32.680]  uses daish here but leon this is more um and i'm not even saying i support the president of turkey
[3:17:32.680 --> 3:17:36.760]  but at least he's raising the issue here of what's happening with isis and how they're getting
[3:17:36.760 --> 3:17:40.600]  these weapons and all the support in syria right well i mean they're arming and funding
[3:17:41.240 --> 3:17:46.520]  terrorists on a different group so it's just a huge mess what's going on there all of these
[3:17:46.520 --> 3:17:51.240]  dictatorships and are including our own with president obama are they're all coming to the
[3:17:51.240 --> 3:17:55.160]  forefront now and fighting with each other and stabbing each other in the back basically
[3:17:55.160 --> 3:17:59.240]  pointing fingers but they're all guilty of the same thing and they really try to politicize
[3:17:59.240 --> 3:18:05.000]  these civil wars these religious wars that have been going on um they start proxy wars in those
[3:18:05.000 --> 3:18:11.240]  regions with people like uh osama bin laden but now uh because these areas are so war torn we're
[3:18:11.240 --> 3:18:15.960]  obviously seeing the increase in refugees come into the united states now this has been politicized
[3:18:15.960 --> 3:18:21.560]  as well especially in the presidential election here that saw trump win but in a new exclusive
[3:18:21.560 --> 3:18:27.720]  video this is on the daily caller immigration official uh ok's syrian immigrants with fake
[3:18:27.720 --> 3:18:33.080]  passports an undercover video yeah an undercover video exclusively obtained by the daily caller
[3:18:33.080 --> 3:18:37.400]  tuesday claims to show an immigration official in new york giving advice on how illegal syrian
[3:18:37.400 --> 3:18:43.720]  immigrants can receive asylum with fake passports wow the uh the place that this video is from is
[3:18:43.720 --> 3:18:49.960]  the united states citizenship and immigration services uh the person who was saying this can
[3:18:49.960 --> 3:18:54.920]  be heard saying chances are considering the situation syria they're not going to be sent back
[3:18:54.920 --> 3:18:59.720]  that's in response to the question uh you know i've got this family here they're worried about their
[3:18:59.720 --> 3:19:04.360]  fake passports them getting uh taken back the guy says oh well chances are considering what's
[3:19:04.360 --> 3:19:08.600]  going on in syria they're not going to be sent back leon what could possibly go wrong i mean
[3:19:08.600 --> 3:19:15.800]  where have we heard before with uh terrorists using fake passports to cross over into germany
[3:19:15.800 --> 3:19:22.600]  and undetected meanwhile they had committed crimes in italy um and then went on to go
[3:19:22.600 --> 3:19:27.080]  commit terror attacks what what could possibly go wrong with allowing people in and then
[3:19:27.080 --> 3:19:32.360]  coaching them on how to use their fake passports well it's ridiculous too because we raise
[3:19:32.360 --> 3:19:37.640]  awareness to the lack of vetting or how you can't vet these people or but it's even worse
[3:19:38.360 --> 3:19:42.920]  the vetting they don't even care about it oh yeah we vetted you that's fake go ahead so if
[3:19:42.920 --> 3:19:46.920]  you're not going to even follow through with the proper vetting what's the point we'll have more
[3:19:46.920 --> 3:19:58.840]  on the fourth hour of the alex joneshow oan shroyer leon macadoo on the other side a little madness

[3:22:03.800 --> 3:22:08.280]  gone so this is uh something that we found today or that you came across today you want to talk
[3:22:08.280 --> 3:22:14.840]  about this apparently we found where pepe came from folks well this is the evidence of the russians
[3:22:14.840 --> 3:22:19.640]  influencing our election because we know that this pepe meme really spread like wildfire
[3:22:19.640 --> 3:22:27.560]  well now the russian empathy tweeted out a pepe meme it was that pepe the frog and this was
[3:22:28.280 --> 3:22:33.880]  the tweet said in today's papers pundits call on teresa may to disrupt possible russia us
[3:22:33.880 --> 3:22:41.480]  thaw no trust in britain's best friend and ally hmm so of course they immediately got some backlash
[3:22:41.480 --> 3:22:48.360]  from the sjw's here hey are you aware of that image's popularity among white nationalists so
[3:22:49.240 --> 3:22:55.080]  anyway is pepe the frog was this part of the russian interference in the election to spread
[3:22:55.080 --> 3:23:00.360]  the pepe the pepe well here's what's funny about it is that now you have the russian embassy trolling
[3:23:00.360 --> 3:23:08.040]  social justice warriors this is this is the level that it's come to in the year 2017 they did the
[3:23:08.040 --> 3:23:15.400]  lame duck to troll obama the other day i don't i mean this it's memes are very powerful meme wars
[3:23:15.400 --> 3:23:20.680]  they're very close you know i actually tweeted out a meme earlier it's uh of martin luther king
[3:23:20.680 --> 3:23:24.920]  with a make america great again hat on be sure and share that make sure you share that i'd love to see
[3:23:24.920 --> 3:23:31.160]  that go as uh as viral as viral as the russian pepe apparently we do it at russian agents the
[3:23:31.160 --> 3:23:39.160]  reverend the reverend if al sharpon is a reverend i'm an astronaut all right i'll see you on mars
[3:23:40.440 --> 3:23:47.320]  al yeah exactly mr um i'm gonna have a huge march in protest of donald hey yeah there it is there's
[3:23:47.320 --> 3:23:53.480]  the martin luther king because here's the deal the reverend the rev is gonna have a protest on
[3:23:53.480 --> 3:23:58.920]  martin luther king day protesting uh donald trump and senator sessions so but apparently that's
[3:23:58.920 --> 3:24:02.760]  failing and i've got a story on that we're gonna get to later yes but you know what the truth is
[3:24:02.760 --> 3:24:10.040]  though the truth is that social justice warriors and and and some radical liberals were actually
[3:24:10.040 --> 3:24:17.000]  more offended by pepe the frog a cartoon frog than they were by the actual kidnapping and hate crimes
[3:24:17.000 --> 3:24:21.880]  that we saw in chicago right so how do you like that well this is more that's that's just i know
[3:24:21.880 --> 3:24:26.920]  we're gonna do a segment for the for the nightly news tonight on you might be are we gonna do that
[3:24:26.920 --> 3:24:31.640]  on the nightly logic if maybe even we can do it later maybe a little special so i came up with a
[3:24:31.640 --> 3:24:36.440]  thing tasty taste but it's like it's itself that way i guess it was jeff foxworthy that you might be
[3:24:36.440 --> 3:24:42.520]  a redneck if so we're gonna do our own version you might be a liberal if i've got like 15 of these
[3:24:42.520 --> 3:24:49.000]  if pepe the frog this cartoon i wasn't on there but then if you're more offended by this then you are
[3:24:49.000 --> 3:24:55.960]  about the kidnapping and torture of a mentally challenged person and hate crime the trolling
[3:24:55.960 --> 3:25:01.800]  is i mean but it's like what are you supposed to do i can't engage in a civil or educated argument
[3:25:01.800 --> 3:25:06.920]  with these people so i just have to troll them i have to mean more than there's no intellect
[3:25:06.920 --> 3:25:13.480]  there's not a battlefield of intellect there speaking of battlefields soon coming to a battlefield
[3:25:13.480 --> 3:25:19.240]  military micro drones the pentagon has successfully tested micro drone swarm the pentagon may soon
[3:25:19.240 --> 3:25:23.720]  be unleashing a 21st century version of locusts on its adversaries after they successfully tested
[3:25:23.720 --> 3:25:31.160]  a swarm of 103 micro drones you can go yeah you can go check out the video of this it's pretty wild
[3:25:31.160 --> 3:25:36.120]  stuff uh but this is apparently uh the latest in military technology this is the alex jones
[3:25:36.120 --> 3:25:40.520]  fourth hour come back on the other side we'll hear again from alex jones and what he thinks about
[3:25:40.520 --> 3:25:48.520]  our new body armor
[3:25:49.320 --> 3:25:56.040]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[3:25:59.880 --> 3:26:05.080]  here is michelle obama in 2008 after her husband was elected what we've learned over this year
[3:26:05.080 --> 3:26:12.520]  is that hope is making a comeback it is making a comeback and let me tell you something for
[3:26:12.520 --> 3:26:19.880]  the first time in my adult lifetime i'm really proud of my country here she is in 2016 as her
[3:26:19.880 --> 3:26:27.640]  husband is leaving office now we're feeling what not having hope feels like you know i love this
[3:26:27.640 --> 3:26:32.840]  according to michelle obama we had hope in 2008 then her husband was in charge for eight years
[3:26:32.840 --> 3:26:39.640]  now here in 2017 we have no hope so according to her barrage legacy is the killer of hope well
[3:26:39.640 --> 3:26:44.680]  thank god real americans are finally feeling hope with donald trump the last bastion of real hope
[3:26:44.680 --> 3:26:50.920]  not just a catchphrase and taking this country back from the no-hope obamas so obama's legacy is no

[3:29:43.400 --> 3:29:54.360]  media matters that's listed by google as a news platform but info wars is not isn't that cute
[3:29:55.240 --> 3:30:03.720]  but again they're the bosses they define things just like they defined it as profiteering off of
[3:30:03.720 --> 3:30:12.280]  the florida shooting last week by another jihadi that we happen to be selling body armor nano tech
[3:30:12.280 --> 3:30:20.440]  beyond space age lightweight body armor and info war store dot com they put two and two together
[3:30:20.440 --> 3:30:26.600]  it's incredible it's so miraculous and they figure it out that we were connecting it to the shooting
[3:30:26.600 --> 3:30:32.280]  and saying you needed it kind of like let's say if i went to colorada in december and i wanted to go
[3:30:32.280 --> 3:30:38.440]  skiing and the weather report said it was real cold so i might want to get some thermal underwear
[3:30:38.440 --> 3:30:46.200]  and a thick coat yes that's right we're selling body armor because of shootings and mass shootings
[3:30:46.200 --> 3:30:52.600]  and other events like that and societal breakdown yes you caught us now is it called profiteering
[3:30:52.600 --> 3:31:00.120]  i don't know we also sell toothpaste so that your teeth are healthy at info wars store dot com
[3:31:00.120 --> 3:31:05.240]  yes your teeth will rot out if you don't brush them several times a day and if you don't get them
[3:31:05.240 --> 3:31:13.400]  cleaned several times a year yes that's not called profiting uh you know off of uh and exploiting
[3:31:14.200 --> 3:31:20.200]  people's teeth falling out that's making money selling somebody something they need
[3:31:21.960 --> 3:31:26.200]  think about how crazy this is but i don't know what you call it i see it all the time where they
[3:31:26.200 --> 3:31:32.280]  try to define reality over and over again where they'll take the most simple common sense thing
[3:31:32.280 --> 3:31:39.320]  and then turn it into something dirty and something bad like look look he's profiting
[3:31:39.320 --> 3:31:45.240]  off the fort lauderdale shooting because his guest host david night and oh and shroyer they
[3:31:45.240 --> 3:31:51.720]  pointed out see for events like this when you're traveling or whatever uh you're able to to put
[3:31:53.640 --> 3:32:00.520]  you know this insert into a backpack or we're able to wear uh this uh lightweight body armor
[3:32:00.520 --> 3:32:06.760]  uh and it weighs you know five times less than the conventional oh what a great innovation
[3:32:07.960 --> 3:32:12.760]  they make jokes about how we call it space age and now only available to the public for the
[3:32:12.760 --> 3:32:19.800]  first time and how state police and the military are using it again it's all true you see when
[3:32:19.800 --> 3:32:25.560]  we sell products whether it's non-gmo heirloom seeds or supplements or body armor or or or
[3:32:25.560 --> 3:32:33.560]  lowers you know uh for guns we're bad and it doesn't matter if it's illogical it's all about
[3:32:33.560 --> 3:32:38.440]  they control reality just like when they say don't say you have a mother and father say you're you
[3:32:38.440 --> 3:32:45.080]  know not a boy or girl you're a purple penguin or don't use the word black use the word african
[3:32:45.080 --> 3:32:50.200]  american or whatever new word we come up with don't say christmas say holiday and now they say
[3:32:50.200 --> 3:32:57.160]  don't say holiday it's all about them controlling reality so you read the article and it reads like
[3:32:57.160 --> 3:33:04.840]  satire but they're deadly serious also the type of people that are authoritarian leftists have
[3:33:04.840 --> 3:33:10.440]  grown up multi generations in cities most of them don't even know how to basically screw a water hose
[3:33:10.440 --> 3:33:14.600]  in you know and water their own yard because they don't have yards and they see everyone else who
[3:33:14.600 --> 3:33:19.080]  has abilities and everyone else who's somewhat self-sufficient and everybody else who's a
[3:33:19.080 --> 3:33:24.840]  masculine as a threat that's why colleges all over the country are saying don't be masculine
[3:33:24.840 --> 3:33:31.960]  masculine is a microaggression men with muscles men who are strong men who are confident it's evil
[3:33:31.960 --> 3:33:39.080]  only women can do that and women are allied with the state because the great law givers the
[3:33:39.080 --> 3:33:45.960]  moses of our world at media matters like david brock because he has that big hair he's got george
[3:33:45.960 --> 3:33:51.880]  soros money and he said so oh and of course media matters also caught me it's always like they catch
[3:33:51.880 --> 3:33:59.960]  me on tv you know i do that secretly i am on tv secretly when i went on national russian television
[3:33:59.960 --> 3:34:04.200]  of course we've been airing this ourselves and talk to some of the folks that are top
[3:34:04.200 --> 3:34:09.640]  putin advisors at least two of them and i i did brag that hey we're reaching out promoting freedom
[3:34:09.640 --> 3:34:17.000]  with russia and promoting free market capitalism and promoting pro-family values and you know promoting
[3:34:17.640 --> 3:34:23.080]  linking up to defeat radical islam oh but the military industrial complex doesn't like that our
[3:34:23.080 --> 3:34:28.840]  military is all for that but the actual folks selling us you know these these these fighter
[3:34:28.840 --> 3:34:33.880]  bombers that that have taken 20 years to develop and cost a billion and a half dollars a piece and
[3:34:33.880 --> 3:34:40.440]  it's up to a trillion plus dollars for the program they're not the traders no no no it's us that don't
[3:34:40.440 --> 3:34:47.400]  want weapons systems that are total ripoffs we're the bad people like trumps a russian agent well
[3:34:47.400 --> 3:34:51.240]  if i'm an agent of the russians and if trumps a russian agent then i'm an easter bunny but i'll
[3:34:51.240 --> 3:34:57.320]  say this russia wants to make us great again russia wants to have trade deals with us russia wants
[3:34:57.320 --> 3:35:03.320]  us to explore oil and gas in their country russia wants family values russia wants private property
[3:35:03.320 --> 3:35:09.480]  boy this sounds like a real enemy to me meanwhile the communist chinese are in our business buying
[3:35:09.480 --> 3:35:14.200]  up hollywood telling us what to do controlling what movies come out and even they got caught
[3:35:14.200 --> 3:35:19.640]  censoring michael savages book and i've personally dealt with the garbage out of the communist chinese
[3:35:19.640 --> 3:35:24.520]  but they're not a problem having both ends of the panama canal and exporting their male population
[3:35:24.520 --> 3:35:28.840]  all over the world and 98 percent of our earth minerals and involved in everything and buying
[3:35:28.840 --> 3:35:36.040]  up tens of thousands of u.s companies they're not an issue no no no no it's all the evil donald trump
[3:35:36.040 --> 3:35:42.760]  that christler just announced is moving factories back here oh oh oh my god these russian agents
[3:35:42.760 --> 3:35:48.440]  they're so horrible he just announced the biggest blue water navy in our history oh and new attack
[3:35:48.440 --> 3:35:55.880]  submarines and nuke cruisers and aircraft carriers and because he's a russian agent that's what the
[3:35:55.880 --> 3:36:03.560]  russians do they build up the military he's buying what the generals and admirals say we need
[3:36:03.560 --> 3:36:08.440]  not let the ripoff globalists have been selling us as part of the overall plan to sabotage this
[3:36:08.440 --> 3:36:14.440]  nation china is developing real weapons at work we're developing crap we've been sabotaged the
[3:36:14.440 --> 3:36:18.200]  globalists are the enemy they're the ones that have hijacked the country and america and the world
[3:36:18.200 --> 3:36:23.560]  is waking up big time to this and we're sick of the traders sapping this country dry the globalists
[3:36:23.560 --> 3:36:29.400]  telling us we're the traders we know who the traders are scumbags and yes folks are buying the body

[3:37:49.160 --> 3:37:53.160]  rest of the mainstream media that doesn't like the fact that we fund ourselves sorry we don't have
[3:37:53.160 --> 3:38:01.320]  to take money from big pharma like you do but we'll be just fine selling that body armor now
[3:38:01.320 --> 3:38:04.360]  this is something i was thinking about this is kind of off the cuff leann but i just wanted
[3:38:04.360 --> 3:38:09.320]  to get this off my chest and maybe you can respond to this this is actually something that woke me up
[3:38:10.440 --> 3:38:16.040]  after the boston marathon bombing it was part of my um becoming woke process to trigger the
[3:38:16.040 --> 3:38:21.000]  trigger the left you're not allowed to say that right i'm woke woke woke but you remember the
[3:38:21.000 --> 3:38:25.240]  boston marathon bombing there was a huge manhunt afterwards right mm-hmm they shut down the city
[3:38:25.240 --> 3:38:31.720]  they shut down the streets and there was this all-out full-on manhunt uh for the two alleged
[3:38:31.720 --> 3:38:40.520]  bombers mm-hmm now there's been no manhunt for seth rich there's been no manhunt no city shut down
[3:38:40.520 --> 3:38:47.080]  no block shut down no serious search in chicago for the record number of homicides and i remember
[3:38:47.080 --> 3:38:53.640]  what woke me up to this was actually not even a week i think it was after the boston marathon
[3:38:53.640 --> 3:38:59.720]  bombing there was a gunman who went into a parade in new orleans um shot about eight people they
[3:38:59.720 --> 3:39:05.320]  caught the whole thing on video and he got away and there was no manhunt and i was sitting here
[3:39:05.320 --> 3:39:08.360]  thinking because the whole boston marathon thing to me is still a head scratch everything that went
[3:39:08.360 --> 3:39:13.240]  on there i'm just sitting here i'm thinking why is there no manhunt why is there a manhunt for
[3:39:13.240 --> 3:39:18.680]  this event but none of the other murders that go on every day i mean it so it was this weird kind
[3:39:18.680 --> 3:39:23.160]  of concocted it didn't seem to make much sense to me but then you say well then wait a second
[3:39:23.160 --> 3:39:28.040]  oh i guess these are radical islamic terrorists that want to blow everybody up so you can't have
[3:39:28.040 --> 3:39:31.560]  your cake and eat it too are these radical islamic terrorists that are trying to blow everybody up
[3:39:31.560 --> 3:39:36.520]  or is the are these just homicidal maniacs just like the other hundreds of homicidal maniacs
[3:39:36.520 --> 3:39:39.880]  that we never shut down the streets for that we never have a manhunt for so i don't know that was
[3:39:39.880 --> 3:39:43.800]  just something i needed to get off my chest land i don't know if you want to take it or leave it
[3:39:43.800 --> 3:39:47.800]  but um still no manhunt for the seth rich killer that we know nothing about
[3:39:47.800 --> 3:39:54.120]  or and there's no city shut down in chicago for the mass number of homicides we saw in 2016 right
[3:39:54.120 --> 3:39:58.840]  well unfortunately they'd be shutting down the streets all the time in chicago if they actually
[3:39:59.400 --> 3:40:04.680]  gave a damn about the fact that at least 10 people are shot every single weekend so uh more gun
[3:40:04.680 --> 3:40:10.040]  control yeah exactly that'll do it that'll do that trick let's have a sit in in the chicago
[3:40:10.680 --> 3:40:16.920]  local government the local city sit in for gun control yes pajama jammy jam well speaking of
[3:40:16.920 --> 3:40:23.560]  the fox guarding the hen house so here's a story that just really infuriated me um maybe you have
[3:40:23.560 --> 3:40:29.160]  heard uh about a story last week kind of broke there was a woman charged with killing her adoptive
[3:40:29.160 --> 3:40:36.200]  daughter last year she and her boyfriend acted out this rape and murder fantasy on their 14-year-old
[3:40:36.200 --> 3:40:44.440]  adopted daughter okay well turns out that this woman who was charged in the killing and dismemberment
[3:40:44.440 --> 3:40:52.840]  of her daughter worked for child services and she had about six foster kids so she was an adoption
[3:40:52.840 --> 3:40:59.880]  supervisor there in pennsylvania she was in charge of deciding if you were fit enough to adopt children
[3:41:00.520 --> 3:41:07.160]  and then her her employment status is listed as suspended okay now why did she get suspended it
[3:41:07.160 --> 3:41:13.560]  doesn't really say but she left the job nearly a year before her husband at the time was charged by
[3:41:13.560 --> 3:41:20.840]  police in the first of two child sex abuse cases so here she was married to another man who is abusing
[3:41:20.840 --> 3:41:28.040]  uh victims under the age of 13 in one instance another statutory sexual assault um under age 16
[3:41:28.040 --> 3:41:33.640]  of another minor so that then she they divorced or whatever happened to them and then she moves on
[3:41:33.640 --> 3:41:38.680]  to this new guy this new boyfriend who they're basically grooming because they had plotted
[3:41:38.680 --> 3:41:44.920]  for nearly a year before this girl was killed in july about this rape and murder and i mean
[3:41:44.920 --> 3:41:49.560]  just terrible but this is this is where we're seeing you know there's a kind of a flashback
[3:41:49.560 --> 3:41:57.400]  there was a story out of california um a thousand california foster care homes match sex offender
[3:41:57.400 --> 3:42:03.560]  addresses a thousand foster homes so people who are foster parents a thousand of them
[3:42:03.560 --> 3:42:10.840]  600 of those highlighted offenders were considered high risk how is this happening how is this
[3:42:10.840 --> 3:42:16.040]  happening where you have someone who is in charge of uh working as the adoption supervisor she's
[3:42:16.040 --> 3:42:20.440]  working for child services has all these foster children and these are the stories that you
[3:42:20.440 --> 3:42:25.560]  hear that these kids that go into these foster homes the state takes away your kids and then
[3:42:25.560 --> 3:42:31.960]  sets them up to be victims of child sex trafficking a lot of times when they go into these foster
[3:42:31.960 --> 3:42:36.440]  homes and then they run away and then they're picked up and they get into sex trafficking
[3:42:36.440 --> 3:42:40.360]  because they don't have anyone that's looking out for them they don't have an adult or parental
[3:42:40.360 --> 3:42:44.760]  unit looking out for them i mean this is just sick how in the heck in california alone
[3:42:44.760 --> 3:42:49.240]  and i'm sure there are other states where this is happening as well these are people
[3:42:49.240 --> 3:42:55.160]  on sex offender registry and they're foster parents well just crazy to me there is you
[3:42:55.160 --> 3:43:00.440]  know a bit of a history with this there's a bit of a psychology with this as well that's why
[3:43:00.440 --> 3:43:05.880]  i guess you know movies like annie or matilda exist where you know they go to these foster
[3:43:05.880 --> 3:43:10.120]  homes and they're just abused they're treated treated like garbage i mean these these these
[3:43:10.120 --> 3:43:13.880]  stories have been uh in movies they've been coming up again and again and i guess that's
[3:43:13.880 --> 3:43:18.600]  just some of the psychology that comes along with the people who want that type of control over
[3:43:18.600 --> 3:43:22.760]  children i'm not saying that well here's all the time obviously well that's the thing is like they'll
[3:43:22.760 --> 3:43:27.880]  they'll snatch your kid away if you don't want to give them vaccines or if you don't there's the
[3:43:27.880 --> 3:43:32.840]  problem if you don't want your child if you want to try to try some alternative treatments for your
[3:43:32.840 --> 3:43:38.360]  child rather than a lobotomy or giving them chemotherapy you are loving lobotomy they'll
[3:43:38.360 --> 3:43:42.440]  take your kids away and put them in some foster homes where there have been plenty of stories
[3:43:42.440 --> 3:43:46.760]  and that's actually what prompted this investigation in california the kid died
[3:43:46.760 --> 3:43:52.280]  while he was there in um in in these facilities in this in this protective care with his caring
[3:43:52.280 --> 3:43:58.200]  loving foster parents he was died and there's so many stories like this where these kids get taken
[3:43:58.200 --> 3:44:02.840]  from these allegedly bad homes where the parent just doesn't want to you know give their kids
[3:44:02.840 --> 3:44:07.080]  vaccine you know or something like that and then they put them somewhere where they're raped they're
[3:44:07.080 --> 3:44:13.000]  killed it's crazy to me this is actually i i tweeted this out is one of my more popular tweets
[3:44:13.640 --> 3:44:21.400]  liberals are all about choice until you're born right you can choose to abort your baby that's
[3:44:21.400 --> 3:44:26.200]  your choice but then as soon as you're born well you don't have a choice anymore you got to get the
[3:44:26.200 --> 3:44:31.720]  vaccine you got to go to the school you got to be indoctrinated into everything that we've laid
[3:44:31.720 --> 3:44:38.120]  out for because we've chosen what's best but before you're born seeing now we well you've
[3:44:38.120 --> 3:44:42.600]  got the choice now right yeah you don't have the say and if you want to give your kid chemotherapy
[3:44:42.600 --> 3:44:47.080]  we we're going to take your kid away from you you're not fit to be a parent you can abort that
[3:44:47.080 --> 3:44:53.240]  kid but as soon as it's born oh that kid is ours yeah don't you be confused you conservative nut
[3:44:53.240 --> 3:44:58.200]  no that's my child once it's born it's your choice before it's born it's my choice after it's born
[3:44:58.200 --> 3:45:02.600]  i know there's so many parents out there that are really dealing with the state and child services
[3:45:02.600 --> 3:45:06.920]  and fighting with them so i i just wish there was something more people could do um when you
[3:45:06.920 --> 3:45:12.600]  hear terrible stories like this this wicked evil disgusting human being was in charge of
[3:45:13.160 --> 3:45:19.480]  telling other families if they were fit enough to have and and she most likely you know try to get
[3:45:19.480 --> 3:45:25.320]  that job because this was her psychology absolutely and she knew she could be in that position absolutely
[3:45:25.320 --> 3:45:30.040]  and that's that's the thing is that's why you have to watch that's why uh human trafficking things
[3:45:30.040 --> 3:45:36.440]  like that are able to be so rampant because it's people in in the positions allowing it to happen
[3:45:36.440 --> 3:45:42.040]  you have your people at the border your your your police your high up politicians they're involved
[3:45:42.040 --> 3:45:46.680]  in this kind of stuff which is why it is allowed to be so rampant and it's terrible but it's true
[3:45:46.680 --> 3:45:50.280]  that's the only way you could imagine that stuff like this gets away with i mean where do all the
[3:45:50.280 --> 3:45:55.720]  kids go i mean somebody in power has to be where controlling this stuff and it's worth saying
[3:45:55.720 --> 3:46:01.880]  tomorrow is actually national human trafficking awareness day um so i know that uh maggie howell
[3:46:01.880 --> 3:46:05.800]  is hosting the nightly news tomorrow night she's gonna be uh filing some special reports on that
[3:46:05.800 --> 3:46:10.440]  uh gonna have a guest to talk about that but you know it all kind of goes uh along the same path
[3:46:10.440 --> 3:46:14.280]  for me it's it's sticking up for the innocent it's sticking up for the children who can't stick up
[3:46:14.280 --> 3:46:20.440]  for themselves and it's making sure that parents and really it goes beyond parents because they're
[3:46:20.440 --> 3:46:25.880]  trying to take the control out of the parents hands right that's what they're trying to do
[3:46:25.880 --> 3:46:31.080]  and i think more people would be willing to fight this if they knew what type of evil was waiting
[3:46:31.080 --> 3:46:35.640]  on the other side like this psychopath right there needs to be more power for the parents so
[3:46:35.640 --> 3:46:39.880]  that they can fight back and and people can understand that just because the state says
[3:46:39.880 --> 3:46:45.160]  you're an unfit parent it's all about awareness read the insert in the vaccine look at the history

[3:51:52.760 --> 3:51:56.840]  this is out of the telegraph half of young people have so many emotional problems they
[3:51:56.840 --> 3:52:02.760]  cannot focus at school now leon i was thinking about this okay and when i social media didn't
[3:52:02.760 --> 3:52:07.080]  really hit until i was in high school that's when kind of it really became big i was never
[3:52:07.080 --> 3:52:11.000]  really into as a as a kid i was playing baseball i was playing basketball i was running around the
[3:52:11.000 --> 3:52:16.040]  neighborhood on my bike um that was my social media um but you know i didn't really get exposed to
[3:52:16.040 --> 3:52:20.200]  it but it's funny even when it came up in high school i could tell it was a joke i never really
[3:52:20.200 --> 3:52:25.560]  got into it and i remember my first facebook profile to mock everybody who was into facebook was
[3:52:25.560 --> 3:52:31.160]  actually a picture of a guy with his head up his butt because i viewed that as the person on facebook
[3:52:31.160 --> 3:52:35.560]  you basically have your head up your butt but what did you think when you saw this i mean we've seen
[3:52:35.560 --> 3:52:40.120]  the studies before that social media can lead to depression but now students can't focus they have
[3:52:40.120 --> 3:52:46.520]  emotional problems well also too you know to give these kids some credit here they're very worried
[3:52:46.520 --> 3:52:50.360]  about the future they don't know you know are they going to get a job when they get out they have no
[3:52:50.360 --> 3:52:55.080]  hope obama promised everyone hope and change but they have no hope they don't know if they're going
[3:52:55.080 --> 3:52:59.800]  to be able to get it they're facing like the worst prospects in decades so these kids are you know
[3:52:59.800 --> 3:53:03.560]  they're worried about their future they're gonna have to live with their parents forever um and
[3:53:03.560 --> 3:53:07.640]  of course you know what's going on the political atmosphere which is being overly hyped what's
[3:53:07.640 --> 3:53:13.960]  so frustrating about it is that they're purposefully doing that for kids oh blame donald trump blame
[3:53:13.960 --> 3:53:19.240]  the white people blame your situation blame everyone except for who's actually responsible
[3:53:19.240 --> 3:53:23.960]  for the fact that you are facing the worst job prospects in history and it that's the whole
[3:53:23.960 --> 3:53:29.320]  divide in conquering let's let's let's get really enraged and go march on washington about donald
[3:53:29.320 --> 3:53:34.280]  trump who hasn't even done anything yet he's not the reason why you're facing the worst job in fact
[3:53:34.280 --> 3:53:39.000]  he's a job creator if you should go try and get a job at trump tower well we've seen that in spades
[3:53:39.000 --> 3:53:44.760]  and it continues to happen but it's funny because even with in our aspect of life in media or just
[3:53:44.760 --> 3:53:48.680]  when you're interacting with your friends and family you can see people who are going more
[3:53:48.680 --> 3:53:54.760]  towards reality and then going farther out into la la land i actually worked with kids before i
[3:53:54.760 --> 3:53:58.520]  started here at info wars and i can tell you this i've noticed the same thing with kids either
[3:53:58.520 --> 3:54:04.440]  they're like really focused like sharp as a tack like oh my gosh that kid is amazing or it's like oh
[3:54:04.440 --> 3:54:11.480]  boy oh boy that kid really needs some help well thanks people trust you around their kids i would
[3:54:11.480 --> 3:54:15.640]  i'm great with kids actually i love i love the kids let's the kids are the future of this country
[3:54:15.640 --> 3:54:18.840]  the kids are the future of this planet we need to bring them up right thanks to everybody who
