[00:00.000 --> 00:13.260]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:13.260 --> 00:34.100]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:34.100 --> 00:39.420]  show on this Wednesday August 5th 2015 I'm David Knight your host will be having
[00:39.420 --> 00:44.780]  reports as well as a call in from Alex Jones reporting on his investigation of
[00:44.780 --> 00:49.340]  the globalist takeover of Europe he is now in Italy there's a lot of news today
[00:49.340 --> 00:53.980]  we have a new not a new Planned Parenthood video of course there was a
[00:53.980 --> 00:58.260]  fifth video released yesterday but we have a video that I think is very telling
[00:58.260 --> 01:03.540]  in a number of ways that revolves around this issue of the Planned Parenthood
[01:03.540 --> 01:09.140]  expose we have a headline at info wars calm brainwashed CNN host asked Planned
[01:09.140 --> 01:14.500]  Parenthood video maker if he's a violent extremist well I would say first of all
[01:14.500 --> 01:19.660]  she's not a brainwashed host I don't agree with that terminology I think she is a
[01:19.660 --> 01:23.940]  host who is actively involved in brainwashing people but when they use
[01:23.940 --> 01:30.340]  the term violent extremists we should understand what's behind that we just
[01:30.340 --> 01:33.820]  had a couple of weeks ago and I knew this was coming I was very concerned about
[01:33.820 --> 01:38.580]  what I saw with Wesley Clark where he was floating the trial balloon saying we
[01:38.580 --> 01:43.540]  need to identify people who could become extremists we need to identify people
[01:43.540 --> 01:47.180]  who might become violent extremists and we need to say to them you have a right
[01:47.180 --> 01:50.540]  of free speech but we also have a right to protect ourselves and we'll lock you
[01:50.540 --> 01:53.740]  up before you do anything you understand that's a pre-crime you
[01:53.740 --> 01:58.100]  understand how dangerous that is and at the same time he's floating that trial
[01:58.100 --> 02:02.900]  balloon Wesley Clark former general former Democrat candidate for president
[02:02.900 --> 02:11.260]  we also have a GOP congressman McCall offering a new bill that sailed through
[02:11.260 --> 02:14.700]  the first committee hearing it's going to go to the floor it's going to be
[02:14.700 --> 02:18.340]  coming up it was unanimously passed through with a voice vote they said
[02:18.340 --> 02:23.740]  yeah this is not controversial at all and what it does is it creates a new
[02:23.740 --> 02:30.060]  division of Homeland Security to combat violent extremism so what is this CNN
[02:30.060 --> 02:34.380]  host who's defending the murder of innocent children the sale of body parts
[02:34.380 --> 02:38.460]  that cues this guy who's doing investigations of being a violent
[02:38.460 --> 02:44.660]  extremist he's taking videos he's not violent he's taking videos they're the
[02:44.660 --> 02:49.140]  ones who are violent we need to understand what's behind this this
[02:49.140 --> 02:56.340]  political labeling of people to lock them up without due process that is going
[02:56.340 --> 03:02.860]  to be under FEMA under Homeland Security we're also going to be looking at a new
[03:02.860 --> 03:08.660]  bio lab that is being built in Kansas there's a lot of concern excuse me a
[03:08.660 --> 03:13.980]  lot of concern about accidents that have been that have happened at the bio labs
[03:13.980 --> 03:18.260]  in Kansas the University of Kansas in terms of research that they've done but
[03:18.260 --> 03:22.540]  now they're building a massive new lab over a billion dollars is going to be
[03:22.540 --> 03:27.140]  spent on this and the people in the area are very concerned because the
[03:27.140 --> 03:32.540]  government is going to be bringing in deadly pathogens and doing agricultural
[03:32.540 --> 03:37.180]  research on these deadly pathogens these are things that the CDC calls select
[03:37.180 --> 03:42.260]  agents things that can be used as bio weapons things that are very deadly if
[03:42.260 --> 03:45.980]  they get out and of course what's the point of this research they do gain a
[03:45.980 --> 03:50.340]  function research on these select agents in other words they want to make them
[03:50.340 --> 03:56.020]  more deadly more easy to spread we've already seen these pathogens get out at
[03:56.020 --> 04:00.580]  the national primate lab in Tulane they brought in a pathogen that is not
[04:00.580 --> 04:04.100]  indigenous to the United States as a matter of fact it's only found in one
[04:04.100 --> 04:08.140]  country in the world that occasionally occurred in one other area of the world
[04:08.140 --> 04:11.980]  but that's it it's not spreading but it was endemic in those two countries they
[04:11.980 --> 04:16.540]  brought that deadly pathogen in they experimented with it in a bio level
[04:16.540 --> 04:22.580]  safety three level lab and it got out and they don't know how it got out it's in
[04:22.580 --> 04:27.340]  the wild there in Louisiana we've had this kind of thing happen before many
[04:27.340 --> 04:32.940]  people believe that's the origins of Lyme disease why are we doing this kind
[04:32.940 --> 04:37.820]  of insane behavior we're also going to be talking to Lionel he's going to be
[04:37.820 --> 04:42.620]  joining us later in the show have some interesting questions to ask him legal
[04:42.620 --> 04:46.180]  questions investigative questions about what's going on with Planned Parenthood
[04:46.180 --> 04:51.100]  also with the issue of pre-crime stay with us it's going to be an interesting
[04:51.100 --> 04:53.380]  show
[04:59.180 --> 05:04.980]  a clothing store owner in Wisconsin opened fire on a bunch of bad guys who
[05:04.980 --> 05:09.100]  were trying to rob the place he successfully defended both his business
[05:09.100 --> 05:14.500]  and his life in the process Rami Murar owner of a Milwaukee based clothing
[05:14.500 --> 05:19.260]  store posted video of the encounter to the company's Instagram account with a
[05:19.260 --> 05:24.380]  stark warning to any other potential burglars don't come to our establishment
[05:24.380 --> 05:28.860]  with guns or try breaking in our stores and expect less than us defending
[05:28.860 --> 05:34.140]  ourselves we will protect our business and employees at any cost that's right
[05:34.140 --> 05:37.260]  and you can tell by the surveillance video that he wasn't messing around
[05:37.260 --> 05:41.180]  apparently the business had been previously hit by criminals multiple
[05:41.180 --> 05:46.380]  times and the business owner had enough and he put his AR-15 to good use you
[05:46.380 --> 05:51.020]  could see in the video how the criminals used a car to smash the doors open so
[05:51.020 --> 05:54.980]  the robbers could get in but they are quickly met with resistance you could

[08:31.980 --> 08:35.900]  Knight your host we're gonna be joined by alex jones the form of special
[08:35.900 --> 08:39.220]  report he's also going to be Skyping and he's of course now investigating
[08:39.220 --> 08:43.300]  goldless takeover of Europe he's going to be calling in with a special report on
[08:43.300 --> 08:47.220]  that we also have Lionel coming in in the third hour we're going to talk to him
[08:47.220 --> 08:52.980]  about some of the hot issues of the day I know he was on RT talking about the
[08:52.980 --> 08:57.580]  pre-crime aspects that are involved in these troubling con the comments that
[08:57.580 --> 09:00.940]  we've seen from Wesley Clark the troubling legislation that we've seen
[09:00.940 --> 09:06.420]  from representative McCall here in Texas creating a department under Homeland
[09:06.420 --> 09:11.060]  Security under FEMA that is going to identify people who have the potential
[09:11.060 --> 09:16.980]  become violent extremists and of course do something about it before they do
[09:16.980 --> 09:21.620]  anything that's called pre-crime folks that's called locking people up before
[09:21.620 --> 09:27.500]  they do anything just on suspicion why does it not surprise us then that we
[09:27.500 --> 09:36.300]  see this investigation this interview by CNN accusing the fellow who made the
[09:36.300 --> 09:40.340]  Planned Parenthood and did the investigation did the videos why did
[09:40.340 --> 09:46.580]  they call him a violent extremist why did they try to pin that on him look we
[09:46.580 --> 09:50.860]  need to understand where all these things eventually come around we saw the
[09:50.860 --> 09:55.740]  Rico statutes initially applied to organized crime then they applied them
[09:55.740 --> 09:59.140]  to people who were abortion protesters so we're gonna talk about that but first
[09:59.140 --> 10:03.060]  I want you to see this video we've got a lot of different news today but I want
[10:03.060 --> 10:07.620]  to get to this video first because this ties in a lot of things it's not just
[10:07.620 --> 10:11.140]  the government ignoring what's going on with Planned Parenthood on the
[10:11.140 --> 10:14.460]  Democrat side it's not the media ignoring it but now they're going on the
[10:14.460 --> 10:19.060]  offensive accusing someone essentially of being a terrorist using the same term
[10:19.060 --> 10:25.380]  of art a violent extremist that they've been floating with legislation and with
[10:25.380 --> 10:29.860]  trial balloons from Wesley Clark former Democrat presidential candidate former
[10:29.860 --> 10:34.820]  general as well as a Republican offering legislation to create a new
[10:34.820 --> 10:40.140]  department in Homeland Security inside of FEMA to implement what he's talking
[10:40.140 --> 10:44.740]  about identifying people that's why they look at your social media that's why we
[10:44.740 --> 10:49.420]  have the geospatial intelligence that's why we have things like unconventional
[10:49.420 --> 10:54.140]  warfare exercises folks this is where this all leads identifying people putting
[10:54.140 --> 10:57.740]  all of your information into their artificial intelligence programs and
[10:57.740 --> 11:03.220]  then seeing who pops up making them the target of the investigation and doing
[11:03.220 --> 11:07.100]  something about it so let's play this interview here and I went we're gonna do
[11:07.100 --> 11:10.740]  this in two parts let's go to the first part guys Planned Parenthood also hasn't
[11:10.740 --> 11:14.700]  produced any evidence that they have any real costs associated with the supply
[11:14.700 --> 11:18.260]  of aborted fetal tissue especially when they're partnered with a middleman
[11:18.260 --> 11:23.020]  biotech company like STEM Express or Novagenix or AVR that sends
[11:23.020 --> 11:27.620]  technicians into the clinics to do the harvesting to identify the patients to
[11:27.620 --> 11:32.060]  receive the fetuses, dissect the specimens, ship them off that's all and
[11:32.060 --> 11:36.340]  exactly that's what we have seen before hang on with that hold that right there
[11:36.340 --> 11:42.980]  pause that can you pause that yeah Novagenix when we had the Lambo lady the
[11:42.980 --> 11:45.380]  one who was talking about yeah I want to make a lot of money I want to get a
[11:45.380 --> 11:48.780]  Lamborghini okay that's a joke but it's not a joke that they make this much
[11:48.780 --> 11:52.620]  money it's not a joke what they're doing to children and what she said to them
[11:52.620 --> 11:56.500]  why she said we have somebody from Novagenix who comes in she comes into
[11:56.500 --> 12:01.180]  the clinic she looks at the aborted babies you don't call that she calls it
[12:01.180 --> 12:05.420]  the fetal tissue of this she selects what she wants and she takes it with her
[12:05.420 --> 12:10.780]  we don't have to do anything it's very very easy for us very very profitable
[12:10.780 --> 12:16.580]  for us in other words okay that's the issue are they doing something that
[12:16.580 --> 12:20.660]  they're getting compensated for that would be the gray area on this but she
[12:20.660 --> 12:24.780]  admitted and he was pointing out in that clip that that's not what's involved
[12:24.780 --> 12:27.620]  here continue on with that clip
[12:27.620 --> 12:32.100]  so absorbed by other outside biotech companies yet Planned Parenthood is
[12:32.100 --> 12:35.700]  still receiving payments per specimen that they produce even I want to stop you
[12:35.700 --> 12:38.660]  there because we did ask Planned Parenthood about that about your claims
[12:38.660 --> 12:42.980]  and we also asked stem express and both of them say that you're wrong they say
[12:42.980 --> 12:47.380]  that there are the only costs that Planned Parenthood gets are the costs for
[12:47.380 --> 12:52.140]  transfer if it involves storage if it involves the time that it takes for a
[12:52.140 --> 12:55.820]  staff member to get consent from a patient in fact let me read to you the
[12:55.820 --> 13:00.140]  statement that stem express gave us about this very thing stem express does
[13:00.140 --> 13:04.180]  not pay Planned Parenthood clinics or any other health care provider for fetal
[13:04.180 --> 13:08.020]  tissue stem express reimburses Planned Parenthood clinics and other health
[13:08.020 --> 13:11.860]  care providers for their reasonable costs associated with the tissue
[13:11.860 --> 13:15.260]  procurement process such as those incurred in connection with storage
[13:15.260 --> 13:19.220]  processing documentation and staff participation so now here are two
[13:19.220 --> 13:22.340]  different organizations Planned Parenthood and the middleman that you're
[13:22.340 --> 13:26.860]  talking about saying that they're not being paid for the sale of fetal tissue
[13:26.860 --> 13:31.140]  yeah I think it's really cute that they have their story straight and that
[13:31.140 --> 13:34.580]  they're they're covering up for each other but I mean what I think that the
[13:34.580 --> 13:37.780]  next question that the media should be asking of stem express and Planned
[13:37.780 --> 13:41.260]  Parenthood is if you go to our website center for medical progress org we have
[13:41.260 --> 13:45.780]  an advertisement from stem express that was an advertisement for Planned
[13:45.780 --> 13:49.580]  Parenthood clinics to tell them that they could make a financial profit they
[13:49.580 --> 13:52.220]  could have fiscal growth to their clinics that it would be a financial
[13:52.220 --> 13:56.060]  benefit to the Planned Parenthood clinics if they partnered with stem express to
[13:56.060 --> 13:59.660]  supply aborted fetal tissue and that advertisement was endorsed by one of
[13:59.660 --> 14:04.580]  Planned Parenthood's medical directors Dr. Dorothy Ferguson so I'm not sure how
[14:04.580 --> 14:07.660]  that flyer that some express has been passing out to Planned Parenthood
[14:07.660 --> 14:11.740]  clinics squares with the statement that they just gave you yeah so in other
[14:11.740 --> 14:14.820]  words they're putting out a flyer that says that you can make a lot of money
[14:14.820 --> 14:18.860]  selling at your tissue to us that stem express putting out but then they say
[14:18.860 --> 14:22.940]  well Planned Parenthood isn't making any profit they're just recovering some of
[14:22.940 --> 14:28.780]  their costs two different stories and what you hear one story from them and
[14:28.780 --> 14:32.380]  then you hear another story when they know when they don't think anybody is
[14:32.380 --> 14:36.940]  watching them you know we talked to Doug Hagman yesterday and he is a licensed
[14:36.940 --> 14:40.540]  investigator in multiple states he's worked with the FBI and with others in
[14:40.540 --> 14:45.500]  terms of investigations of criminal activity this is not a conspiracy
[14:45.500 --> 14:50.380]  theory this is not a hoax this is not entrapment there are people who were
[14:50.380 --> 14:54.620]  saying that this is being done by Planned Parenthood it was there were
[14:54.620 --> 14:58.180]  questions about what was being done this wasn't a complete setup they didn't
[14:58.180 --> 15:01.740]  come in and say well you know why don't you think of doing this this is
[15:01.740 --> 15:04.780]  something obviously they've been doing for quite some time they're talking
[15:04.780 --> 15:08.660]  about how they did it they're talking about how they had people previously
[15:08.660 --> 15:12.300]  that they've been contracting with this is how they do it we don't have to do
[15:12.300 --> 15:16.820]  anything which means they have no cost that's what they're telling people in
[15:16.820 --> 15:21.380]  this investigation all investigations are done like this this is not
[15:21.380 --> 15:26.220]  entrapment this is not a cleverly edited video you can see how long they
[15:26.220 --> 15:30.260]  dialogue about this let's go to the next clip because this is where it gets I
[15:30.260 --> 15:35.420]  think even more sinister your critics critics of your organization I should say
[15:35.420 --> 15:39.940]  say that you're not journalists as you purport to be on your website but rather
[15:39.940 --> 15:44.180]  your violent extremists they say that you are operating under the guise of
[15:44.180 --> 15:48.660]  investigative reporting but really you're trying to shut down all Planned
[15:48.660 --> 15:54.020]  Parenthoods and women's access to things like birth control and other services
[15:54.020 --> 16:01.180]  that they provide do you have any ties to operation rescue so a couple of things
[16:01.180 --> 16:04.540]  their first number one I'm not a violent person and I never have been and I
[16:04.540 --> 16:08.740]  never will be um Troy Newman is one of the board members of the Center for
[16:08.740 --> 16:12.420]  Medical Progress and Troy Newman is the president of Operation Rescue that does
[16:12.420 --> 16:18.220]  have I mean Operation Rescue does have a history of threatening violence against
[16:18.220 --> 16:22.900]  abortion clinics you know I don't think that's true at all you'd have to you'd
[16:22.900 --> 16:28.140]  have to talk to Troy specifically about you know how how about the full history
[16:28.140 --> 16:32.180]  of Operation Rescue and some of those details but I don't think that's a fair
[16:32.180 --> 16:37.140]  characterization at all as far as the as far as the second point ultimately the
[16:37.140 --> 16:39.740]  the two-and-a-half year long investigative journalism study that
[16:39.740 --> 16:42.500]  the Center for Medical Progress conducted about Planned Parenthood sale of
[16:42.500 --> 16:47.780]  fetal tissue ultimately that's about exposing to the public the the reality
[16:47.780 --> 16:51.900]  of how Planned Parenthood conducts their fetal tissue sales and what their
[16:51.900 --> 16:55.140]  relationship with companies like StemExpress is like it's not an issue
[16:55.140 --> 16:58.380]  of the rest of Planned Parenthood services or whether or not those are a
[16:58.380 --> 17:03.620]  good thing it's it's specifically about showing the public exactly how those
[17:03.620 --> 17:08.700]  sales work and documenting those in a way that everybody can see precisely but
[17:08.700 --> 17:13.740]  this is how it's going to be used this is the pre-crime aspect this is the
[17:13.740 --> 17:18.740]  incrimination by the media what she's doing to him is exactly what Glenn Beck
[17:18.740 --> 17:24.580]  did to the Bundy's when he had him on his program and they said are you a
[17:24.580 --> 17:31.220]  sovereign citizen these are terms they've created terms of art that they use to
[17:31.220 --> 17:36.820]  not only assassinate people but they're going to be used to lock people up now
[17:36.820 --> 17:41.020]  he didn't know what that meant and I'm sure that David DeLyden doesn't
[17:41.020 --> 17:46.140]  understand that this violent extremist is a term of art that's being used he
[17:46.140 --> 17:49.420]  says of course we're not violent I mean the people that they're recording were
[17:49.420 --> 17:53.020]  the ones who were violent but they were just doing an investigation there was
[17:53.020 --> 17:56.620]  nothing at all violent about that there's absolutely no justification for
[17:56.620 --> 18:01.300]  her to accuse him of that but that's what is behind this you need to be aware
[18:01.300 --> 18:04.980]  of how they're bringing this out you need to be aware of the trial balloons of
[18:04.980 --> 18:09.540]  Wesley Clark you need to be aware of the GOP legislation because the GOP is
[18:09.540 --> 18:15.940]  ready to sacrifice every one of your rights on the altar of state security
[18:15.940 --> 18:20.220]  and that's not going to make you any safer that's going to have you living
[18:20.220 --> 18:24.180]  under an authoritarian government let's look at an example many of you may have
[18:24.180 --> 18:28.580]  heard of a pastor called Randy Alcorn he's not a pastor anymore but he is a
[18:28.580 --> 18:32.620]  writer he's done a lot of Christian fiction books very popular he's made
[18:32.620 --> 18:36.500]  millions and millions of dollars with these books that he writes but he hasn't
[18:36.500 --> 18:42.420]  earned a cent and there's a reason for this he refuses to take the money because
[18:42.420 --> 18:46.780]  he lost in a lawsuit they came after him with a lawsuit they've come after others
[18:46.780 --> 18:53.060]  with RICO statutes people who were passive protesters people who stood
[18:53.060 --> 18:57.900]  outside an abortion clinic with signs like many of us at Info Wars did we
[18:57.900 --> 19:02.020]  organize that protests of local abortion clinic they would get judgments
[19:02.020 --> 19:07.360]  against people in the case of Randy Alcorn back in 1989 Portland police had
[19:07.360 --> 19:11.020]  arrested him several times for blocking the doors of abortion clinics one of
[19:11.020 --> 19:15.380]  the clinics that sued him and other rescuers quote-unquote they want a small
[19:15.380 --> 19:20.620]  judgment plus attorney fees he refused to pay on principle he said it would
[19:20.620 --> 19:25.020]  violate his conscience to write a check to an abortion clinic now he had
[19:25.020 --> 19:29.860]  already placed his assets his home his car other things in his wife's name and
[19:29.860 --> 19:35.660]  he was not going to pay that judgment but they came after him even garnishing
[19:35.660 --> 19:40.380]  his wages so he resigned as a pastor he has made millions of dollars in royalties
[19:40.380 --> 19:45.540]  and who has refused to turn a cent over that's the way they will come after you
[19:45.540 --> 19:49.740]  and they will use the RICO statutes they will use these new statutes against
[19:49.740 --> 19:54.380]  violent extremists against anyone that they consider to be a political enemy
[19:54.380 --> 19:57.380]  stay with us we'll be right back

[24:19.420 --> 24:23.620]  special report in the next segment operation chaos and of course we have a
[24:23.620 --> 24:29.580]  global immigration crisis it's by design that's the words of the home
[24:29.580 --> 24:33.540]  secretary she didn't say it was by design she said it was a global immigration
[24:33.540 --> 24:38.820]  crisis that was a home secretary of the UK working with her French counterpart to
[24:38.820 --> 24:44.620]  try to stop the massive influx of criminal immigrants through the channel
[24:44.620 --> 24:50.060]  coming from Calais into the UK and of course we can see this in the United
[24:50.060 --> 24:55.300]  States as well as one of the reasons why Donald Trump has peaked in the campaign
[24:55.300 --> 25:00.860]  polls is because he's spoken the truth about this that those the rest of those
[25:00.860 --> 25:03.820]  in government will not talk about we're gonna talk about that in just one
[25:03.820 --> 25:07.100]  moment of course we're gonna have a special report from Alex Jones in the

[26:10.300 --> 26:13.500]  other stories that we were talking about I wanted to there's one more thing I
[26:13.500 --> 26:19.020]  wanted to say about the Planned Parenthood situation but there have been
[26:19.020 --> 26:23.380]  more shots fired on soldiers in Mississippi this happened yesterday
[26:23.380 --> 26:28.180]  around Camp Shelby there was a heightened state of alert yesterday after
[26:28.180 --> 26:33.500]  there were shots fired people believe that it was a a white male and a red or
[26:33.500 --> 26:38.660]  maroon pickup truck and today it has happened again. Mississippi governor
[26:38.660 --> 26:41.860]  Phil Bryant said this is one of the reasons I recently signed an executive
[26:41.860 --> 26:46.620]  order directing certain National Guard personnel to be armed however he cannot
[26:46.620 --> 26:52.220]  arm the regular military and as we all know from the Fort Hood shootings from
[26:52.220 --> 26:56.780]  the shootings at the recruitment stations the Pentagon has disarmed our
[26:56.780 --> 27:01.180]  soldiers at the bases they're not allowed to protect themselves only the
[27:01.180 --> 27:05.940]  MPs are allowed to have arms the rest of them are locked up on bases so far no
[27:05.940 --> 27:10.420]  injuries have been reported and either incident is a very concerning situation
[27:10.420 --> 27:13.780]  because we have to be concerned about it if it's legitimate we also have to be
[27:13.780 --> 27:17.860]  concerned about it if it's a false flag because of the military operations that
[27:17.860 --> 27:20.860]  are going on with Jade Helm and other things this is what many people were
[27:20.860 --> 27:25.300]  concerned that there might be some kind of a false flag attack and of course in
[27:25.300 --> 27:29.700]  either instance whether it's legitimate or whether it's a false flag people
[27:29.700 --> 27:34.060]  could really die with this a very dangerous situation there again for
[27:34.060 --> 27:37.980]  second day shots have been fired in Mississippi now we were just talking
[27:37.980 --> 27:42.500]  about Planned Parenthood and before I went on I just wanted to talk one more
[27:42.500 --> 27:46.780]  time about this article that was up at Info Wars.com yesterday about Obama
[27:46.780 --> 27:53.420]  speaking out against organ harvesting of African albinos now he's concerned
[27:53.420 --> 27:58.380]  about that the practice that's happening in Africa where they are killing babies
[27:58.380 --> 28:03.500]  and taking their body parts harvesting their organs and ritualized killing
[28:03.500 --> 28:11.500]  because they're albinos and yet he completely ignores the massive harvesting
[28:11.500 --> 28:15.820]  of organs by Planned Parenthood absolutely stunning to see that but
[28:15.820 --> 28:20.260]  here's something else that came up actually Judd is taken to Twitter to
[28:20.260 --> 28:23.780]  defend the Planned Parenthood practices and this is what she tweeted out she
[28:23.780 --> 28:28.700]  said my well-women health care provider thank you always Planned Parenthood
[28:28.700 --> 28:33.260]  that's where she goes to get her health care she says and some of the people had
[28:33.260 --> 28:38.140]  some real biting comments one of them said if you want health care next to the
[28:38.140 --> 28:42.100]  room where they're rummaging through baby parts okay but I'm not paying for it
[28:42.100 --> 28:48.460]  another one said women's health what BS I'm 66 I have never walked through your
[28:48.460 --> 28:55.140]  doors I go to a doctor's office you belong in a prison and another one says
[28:55.140 --> 29:00.340]  really times must be tough for Harvard grads and movie stars as well right
[29:00.340 --> 29:05.100]  she's trying to tell us that she can't get health care if they shut down
[29:05.100 --> 29:10.500]  funding government funding to Planned Parenthood and of course the bills to
[29:10.500 --> 29:15.340]  defund Planned Parenthood would say they're still going to fund women's
[29:15.340 --> 29:20.660]  clinics but not any women's clinics that perform abortion that's the difference
[29:20.660 --> 29:26.740]  that's where we should draw the line I don't think that anybody should have a
[29:26.740 --> 29:32.660]  problem with not funding something that is at least as controversial as this but
[29:32.660 --> 29:36.060]  of course they want to close their eyes and they want to go on the attack
[29:36.060 --> 29:40.940]  accusing anyone who exposes this practice of being a violent extremist and
[29:40.940 --> 29:45.060]  you know what's behind that stay with us we'll be right back
[29:48.540 --> 29:55.540]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[29:55.540 --> 30:04.420]  network a clothing store owner in Wisconsin opened fire on a bunch of bad
[30:04.420 --> 30:08.660]  guys who were trying to rob the place he successfully defended both his
[30:08.660 --> 30:14.060]  business and his life in the process Rami Murar owner of a Milwaukee based
[30:14.060 --> 30:18.540]  clothing store posted video of the encounter to the company's Instagram
[30:18.540 --> 30:23.740]  account with a stark warning to any other potential burglars don't come to our
[30:23.740 --> 30:28.420]  establishment with guns or try breaking in our stores and expect less than us
[30:28.420 --> 30:33.180]  defending ourselves we will protect our business and employees at any cost
[30:33.180 --> 30:36.740]  that's right and you can tell by the surveillance video that he wasn't
[30:36.740 --> 30:40.780]  messing around apparently the business had been previously hit by criminals
[30:40.780 --> 30:45.700]  multiple times and the business owner had enough and he put his AR-15 to good
[30:45.700 --> 30:50.100]  use you could see in the video how the criminals used a car to smash the
[30:50.100 --> 30:54.460]  doors open so the robbers could get in but they are quickly met with resistance
[30:54.460 --> 31:00.540]  you could see the video in its entirety right now at info wars com when cells

[33:15.260 --> 33:27.140]  it's alex jones on the GCN radio network when you go see james bond movies or
[33:27.140 --> 33:33.540]  when you watch silly TV shows from the 60s like get smart and you see
[33:33.540 --> 33:39.220]  organizations named specter or chaos you can see things happening in the real
[33:39.220 --> 33:43.700]  world and make a joke out of it but it's not funny those films and those
[33:43.700 --> 33:51.620]  comedies are reflecting what really goes on in the real world now we're dubbing
[33:51.620 --> 33:57.140]  when I'm about to break down operation chaos but I bet you my right arm and
[33:57.140 --> 34:04.900]  it's a safe bet that within the internal NATO DARPA forward foundation
[34:04.900 --> 34:10.580]  council on foreign relations globalist think tanks that it's called something
[34:10.580 --> 34:16.060]  like operation destabilization or operation chaos because I've read so
[34:16.060 --> 34:19.340]  many other other documents I've covered it in films like the Obama deception
[34:19.340 --> 34:24.860]  fall the Republican game where we get the North American Union minutes when
[34:24.860 --> 34:28.980]  judicial watch student got them and they're there saying we will use crises
[34:28.980 --> 34:34.300]  for stealth integration of the NA you into the Atlantic Treaty and the TPP
[34:34.300 --> 34:39.940]  that's an eight year old film now TPP is popular understood to be corporate
[34:39.940 --> 34:45.460]  domination but a decade ago 20 years ago people were not aware of it so that's
[34:45.460 --> 34:51.660]  the positive news but what is operation chaos again that's our name for it but
[34:51.660 --> 34:57.020]  that's what it is arose is still arose by any other name and people need to get
[34:57.020 --> 35:02.220]  their minds wrapped around it this is planned and that's why whether it's
[35:02.220 --> 35:06.100]  happening in France or whether it's happening in the UK or whether it's
[35:06.100 --> 35:11.060]  happening in Italy or whether it's happening in Greece it is the same thing
[35:11.060 --> 35:17.500]  over and over again the same thing in the US Southwest and that is the people
[35:17.500 --> 35:24.820]  bomb the focused masses of six plus billion third world people that are
[35:24.820 --> 35:32.060]  pouring in and being given economic amnesty as economic refugees and are
[35:32.060 --> 35:35.900]  then being put on welfare are allowed to have their babies paid for for free
[35:35.900 --> 35:42.860]  are given everything and then filled full of liberation theology that they
[35:42.860 --> 35:46.900]  deserve everything for free and that the indigenous populations of Europe are
[35:46.900 --> 35:52.820]  bad people that need to turn everything they've got over to them it is wild so
[35:52.820 --> 35:59.620]  out of my research trip to the UK to Spain now to Italy what we read in the
[35:59.620 --> 36:04.900]  newspapers is conservatively five ten times worse than what we thought there
[36:04.900 --> 36:08.940]  are more foreigners it seems like in Rome and other cities around Rome same
[36:08.940 --> 36:13.340]  thing with Barcelona and Spain and Valencia where we traveled then there
[36:13.340 --> 36:23.340]  are Spanish or there are Italians and the foreigners are aggressive they are
[36:23.340 --> 36:28.820]  involved in much of the crime and they are entitled look at this article out of
[36:28.820 --> 36:34.740]  the International New York Times from yesterday now the New York Times itself
[36:34.740 --> 36:43.100]  calls this a huge crisis in fact I've got my notes right here let me give you
[36:43.100 --> 36:47.660]  the exact quote the New York Times calls it a full-scale disaster I wrote notes
[36:47.660 --> 36:57.140]  here a full-scale disaster and why is it a full-scale disaster hmm they've
[36:57.140 --> 36:59.940]  already moved in giant immigrant populations who then are allowed to
[36:59.940 --> 37:04.180]  vote who are allowed to hold government office in the EU and the US I'm gonna
[37:04.180 --> 37:07.620]  cover that in a moment it's been celebrated in the New York Times that
[37:07.620 --> 37:11.780]  illegal aliens are being appointed to major commissions in California to run
[37:11.780 --> 37:18.220]  things when you look at all this it's an organized plan if you give the
[37:18.220 --> 37:23.780]  illegals free health care babies can be had for free all these goodies when no
[37:23.780 --> 37:27.860]  other countries in the world allow this but the West you will bring in larger
[37:27.860 --> 37:32.420]  populations of people fleeing their collapsing nations so the big major
[37:32.420 --> 37:35.820]  corporations on record destabilize Africa destabilize the Middle East
[37:35.820 --> 37:40.100]  destabilize these different regions so they're economically in bad shape so
[37:40.100 --> 37:44.300]  they can buy it up cheap get the resources cheap they use Western money
[37:44.300 --> 37:48.460]  to back our militaries to do this but then do we get the booty do we get the
[37:48.460 --> 37:52.020]  spoils I'm not endorsing invading these countries for spoils but we don't even
[37:52.020 --> 37:56.100]  get them we pay for it the globalist then get the spoils they're always
[37:56.100 --> 37:59.780]  selling it like the West somehow it is sucking off the third world it's the
[37:59.780 --> 38:05.500]  other way around the people of the West are the ones that basically are fitting
[38:05.500 --> 38:09.380]  the bill when you actually look at the numbers so operation chaos is meant to
[38:09.380 --> 38:13.780]  bankrupt Europe bankrupt the United States bankrupt Canada bankrupt Australia
[38:13.780 --> 38:17.460]  and then we're all conquered and then it's game over because the elitists
[38:17.460 --> 38:21.300]  themselves live behind walled cities like over at the Vatican that's above the
[38:21.300 --> 38:25.420]  law diplomatic immunity for 15 years straight won't even pay its power bill
[38:25.420 --> 38:30.700]  to the city of Rome and and the city of Rome dare not turn the power off to
[38:30.700 --> 38:34.820]  the Vatican I mean that's above the law when the power lines run into Vatican
[38:34.820 --> 38:39.580]  City a third the size of Rome and they don't even pay for the power bill above
[38:39.580 --> 38:44.540]  the law don't pay for the power bill just like the UN above the law and the US
[38:44.540 --> 38:49.620]  basically pays for half the bills the UN about 50% it's the same globalist
[38:49.620 --> 38:53.060]  model where the Pope's lecturing middle-class people to pay more taxes
[38:53.060 --> 38:57.180]  and to pay carbon taxes to the central banks and social welfare and social
[38:57.180 --> 39:00.820]  justice and open the borders up and do all this when he lives behind a walled
[39:00.820 --> 39:04.940]  city and is above the law and the Vatican one of the richest institutions in the
[39:04.940 --> 39:10.500]  world estimated to have over 100 trillion in land assets alone that's
[39:10.500 --> 39:16.420]  mainstream ish 100 trillion dollars in land around Rome it seems like every
[39:16.420 --> 39:21.220]  other building is owned by a tax exempt above the law pissing on everybody
[39:21.220 --> 39:25.180]  doing whatever they want and I'm not bashing Catholics I'm bashing this
[39:25.180 --> 39:28.980]  above-the-law institution over here just like the UN just like the city of
[39:28.980 --> 39:32.900]  London within London just like DC is above the law doesn't pay taxes just
[39:32.900 --> 39:35.900]  like all these billionaires don't pay taxes but they're the biggest recipients
[39:35.900 --> 39:40.420]  of banker bailouts like Warren Buffett it's an above-the-law class class
[39:40.420 --> 39:45.420]  warfaring with giant third-world populations saying sick them on the
[39:45.420 --> 39:50.060]  middle class that buys persons that buys cars that stays at hotels that has
[39:50.060 --> 39:56.380]  15 20 30 40 50 employees they don't want a real economy under gen 21 it's their
[39:56.380 --> 40:01.900]  stated mission to shut off your economy but to bring in their control they need
[40:01.900 --> 40:10.500]  operation chaos the New York Times admits 107,000 illegals that they call
[40:10.500 --> 40:17.380]  refugees out of Africa in the Middle East in just the first six months of 2015
[40:17.380 --> 40:23.220]  to one island lesbos where the legend of the beautiful women comes from and the
[40:23.220 --> 40:28.660]  lesbians are angry and I don't mean two women together I'm saying the people that
[40:28.660 --> 40:36.140]  live on the beautiful island of lesbos that has had 107,000 registered by the
[40:36.140 --> 40:41.120]  UN people wash ashore it's got them bitching and complaining saying I've
[40:41.120 --> 40:45.340]  been in here for days I want my welfare I want my hotel I want out of here and
[40:45.340 --> 40:48.740]  they let them out they don't deport hardly any of them they sign them up for
[40:48.740 --> 40:55.380]  welfare as Greece itself is imploding and many Grecian people are on the
[40:55.380 --> 41:01.340]  street many Greeks are on the street and their system is collapsing this is
[41:01.340 --> 41:04.820]  what's happening this is the chaos and then their answer is we'll control the
[41:04.820 --> 41:08.940]  borders pay more taxes let the EU get rid of what's left of your sovereignty
[41:08.940 --> 41:14.820]  while the EU commission that's unelected look it up just type in EU
[41:14.820 --> 41:20.100]  Commission demands quotas for more migrants don't call any legals call
[41:20.100 --> 41:25.500]  them migrants call them refugees and I'm not against these poor people I live
[41:25.500 --> 41:28.940]  in North Africa in a hellhole I want to move to Italy I want to move there
[41:28.940 --> 41:35.060]  already I mean it's nice but but Italy Greece all these places are collapsing
[41:35.060 --> 41:40.780]  into debt that's untenable this is operation chaos and then meanwhile in
[41:40.780 --> 41:44.620]  the very same New York Times this is just one newspaper we're seeing in here on
[41:44.620 --> 41:49.460]  the ground they admit that heartable Greeks are protesting and horrible
[41:49.460 --> 41:53.700]  Italians are protesting that in the nicest middle-class neighborhoods
[41:53.700 --> 41:58.460]  they're busing the illegals in they get here on rafts and bring them into their
[41:58.460 --> 42:03.260]  neighborhoods and then ordering everyone to just submit to them and so they're
[42:03.260 --> 42:07.100]  calling it racist that the Italians and the Greeks don't like it now that's in
[42:07.100 --> 42:12.260]  the same article and meanwhile it's also bad the LA Times reports if you don't
[42:12.260 --> 42:18.380]  like the two illegal aliens now appointed in California in Huffington Park
[42:18.380 --> 42:23.780]  they're undocumented let me use the proper word to now run the undocumented
[42:23.780 --> 42:28.580]  program so there you go and they say because they're uniquely qualified to
[42:28.580 --> 42:33.340]  get city taxpayer money as felons and to do all this I mean this is a revolution
[42:33.340 --> 42:37.580]  of the ultra-rich pressure from above and the ultra-poor pressure from below
[42:37.580 --> 42:41.900]  pressure from below this is a total and complete takeover with the big
[42:41.900 --> 42:46.300]  corporations and the giant six and a half plus billion people that live
[42:46.300 --> 42:52.740]  outside the few wealthy industrialized nations this is a total takeover and it
[42:52.740 --> 42:58.140]  is just mind-blowing to physically see it because I don't speak Italian but I
[42:58.140 --> 43:00.660]  was able to look up the groups and we actually have some video of this we're
[43:00.660 --> 43:03.220]  going to put in a produced report probably when we get back because I've
[43:03.220 --> 43:06.780]  shot so much footage I see people throwing plastic bottles at the police
[43:06.780 --> 43:11.020]  yelling there's probably about 500 protesters and I thought it was some
[43:11.020 --> 43:14.260]  leftist group telling went and looked it up and it was a group just a workers
[43:14.260 --> 43:19.260]  group traditionally leftists that is upset about the open borders and upset
[43:19.260 --> 43:23.340]  about losing their jobs so this isn't going to help the third world bringing
[43:23.340 --> 43:27.340]  everybody in and collapsing the wages it's going to turn the West into the
[43:27.340 --> 43:33.100]  third world and this is the plan this is the program this is organized chaos and
[43:33.100 --> 43:37.620]  you notice free welfare in the US brings the illegals in the train loads the bus
[43:37.620 --> 43:40.940]  loads the border patrols secretly shipping them in same thing here
[43:40.940 --> 43:45.780]  government continuing the smuggling process and hell if Europeans are this
[43:45.780 --> 43:48.900]  bad thing for all the horrible stuff that Europe has invented and all the
[43:48.900 --> 43:52.540]  horrible things Europe has done actually Europe's a lot of horrible things but
[43:52.540 --> 43:54.540]  look at every other country's done as well every other groups done the same
[43:54.540 --> 43:59.260]  stuff stuff or worse is there anywhere Europeans are allowed to be I mean if
[43:59.260 --> 44:02.300]  we're not supposed to be in North America and we're not supposed to be in
[44:02.300 --> 44:05.540]  Asia we're not supposed to be in Africa could Europeans please be here if we're
[44:05.540 --> 44:10.140]  so hellish and so bad and so exploitive why does everyone have to come here and
[44:10.140 --> 44:15.420]  then put everyone down because the ultra rich are involved in class warfare and
[44:15.420 --> 44:21.740]  they're the ones pushing racial divide racial ideas racial infighting that's
[44:21.740 --> 44:27.060]  the key to this the eugenicists know this will actually make Europeans become
[44:27.060 --> 44:31.020]  tribal and become racist and then be controlled by the globalist that again
[44:31.020 --> 44:35.780]  helped create the crisis and that's the key here just like prison wardens all
[44:35.780 --> 44:40.260]  over the world control prisons by race those the best-run prisons black white
[44:40.260 --> 44:45.580]  Hispanic Asian and they promote the fact that everything's racially based because
[44:45.580 --> 44:49.860]  it's divide and conquer so at every level bankrupt the economy bringing the
[44:49.860 --> 44:53.180]  illegals to do it drive down the wages bringing the illegals to do it bringing
[44:53.180 --> 44:56.740]  the illegals to vote illegally to checkmate the indigenous populations
[44:56.740 --> 45:01.900]  more divide and conquer pay for it all demonize anybody that doesn't go along
[45:01.900 --> 45:09.060]  with it this is how they're operating and it is a giant program of
[45:09.060 --> 45:14.220]  destabilization it is operation chaos now in the coming days we're going to be
[45:14.220 --> 45:18.260]  covering the Vatican in depth we're going to be going in you know documenting
[45:18.260 --> 45:21.420]  talking to locals around the Vatican we're talking to some experts we're
[45:21.420 --> 45:25.540]  going to be looking more at the economic implosion that's taking place we are
[45:25.540 --> 45:29.780]  not here demonizing these poor people from the third world we're only pointing
[45:29.780 --> 45:34.420]  out that globalization has engineered the full collapse of their society then
[45:34.420 --> 45:39.700]  with a conduit to bring them in to further the chaos economy the problem
[45:39.700 --> 45:44.740]  reaction solution economy Alex Jones reporting from Rome Italy more is
[45:44.740 --> 45:50.300]  coming back to David Knight in the info wars news center in Austin Texas
[45:50.300 --> 45:55.420]  exactly and as Alex was pointing out we have a global immigration crisis that's
[45:55.420 --> 45:59.700]  what Theresa May the UK Home Secretary said her approach was to stop
[45:59.700 --> 46:05.940]  subsidizing immigration every other country even places like believes not a
[46:05.940 --> 46:09.980]  first-world country you have to prove before you can become a citizen a
[46:09.980 --> 46:13.820]  resident of that country that you are able to support yourself and anyone that
[46:13.820 --> 46:19.660]  you bring with you even in believes not just in places like Switzerland we're
[46:19.660 --> 46:24.300]  the only ones who are not only extending welfare benefits to any and
[46:24.300 --> 46:29.900]  everyone who wants to come here with or without legal permission we are doing it
[46:29.900 --> 46:34.420]  at a higher rate than we do giving them better benefits than we do people who
[46:34.420 --> 46:39.420]  are American citizens giving in-state tuition to immigrants illegal immigrants
[46:39.420 --> 46:44.460]  regardless of where they go where they live they can go to any state and get
[46:44.460 --> 46:50.980]  in-state tuition no citizen can do that giving them legal immunity as if they
[46:50.980 --> 46:55.020]  were ambassadors when they commit crimes look at these two reports of course
[46:55.020 --> 46:58.380]  this one was mentioned by Alex in that report you just heard about the
[46:58.380 --> 47:03.220]  Huntington Park Council appoints two undocumented immigrants as commissioners
[47:03.220 --> 47:08.900]  illegal aliens they're now being appointed by the as commissioners on city
[47:08.900 --> 47:14.020]  advisory boards we're giving people who are not citizens of this country who
[47:14.020 --> 47:19.420]  have not grown up in this country to have not adopted our system of government
[47:19.420 --> 47:24.220]  have taken no oath of loyalty to the Constitution maybe don't even understand
[47:24.220 --> 47:30.540]  it we're giving them the right to vote we're putting them on city counts city
[47:30.540 --> 47:35.340]  advisory boards as commissioners this is absolutely insane but we're also giving
[47:35.340 --> 47:41.420]  them legal immunity as criminals as I've mentioned before I went to the Austin
[47:41.420 --> 47:46.900]  Council meeting I saw the Democrat Party attacking a black Democrat sheriff
[47:46.900 --> 47:51.140]  saying you're in the wrong party because he was supporting the Secure
[47:51.140 --> 47:54.380]  Communities Initiative which would essentially take someone that has a
[47:54.380 --> 47:59.380]  previous criminal record and turn them over to ICE they said well you can have
[47:59.380 --> 48:04.340]  a criminal record just because you came into the country illegally yeah yeah
[48:04.340 --> 48:08.260]  that's a criminal record but you could also be a dangerous criminal and when
[48:08.260 --> 48:12.540]  they take away the Secure Communities Initiative they are letting all the
[48:12.540 --> 48:17.460]  criminals violent and nonviolent out look at this particular example this is
[48:17.460 --> 48:22.860]  from Breitbart alleged child molester kept his dreamer amnesty despite risk
[48:22.860 --> 48:29.580]  designation this is a California camp counselor charged with child molestation
[48:29.580 --> 48:35.140]  distribution of child pornography he was able to maintain his deferred action
[48:35.140 --> 48:40.340]  for childhood arrivals DACA because this guy is no child he is a child
[48:40.340 --> 48:46.300]  molester he is a child panographer he is an adult but of course Obama's DACA
[48:46.300 --> 48:50.660]  deferred action for childhood arrivals that goes up to people who are 31 years
[48:50.660 --> 48:55.140]  old they still consider them to be children that's our childish notions that

[49:11.860 --> 49:16.980]  these questions of the immigration services they said what are you aware
[49:16.980 --> 49:21.460]  that he was under investigation for child molestation and it turns out that
[49:21.460 --> 49:27.540]  various asked by various agencies were and he got his dreamer status even though
[49:27.540 --> 49:34.460]  he was under investigation for child molestation and child pornography see it

[49:38.700 --> 49:44.060]  what people from Glenn Beck to MSNBC will tell you it is not about that he

[54:16.380 --> 54:21.980]  August 5th 2015 I want to go over some individual news accounts things that are
[54:21.980 --> 54:27.380]  on our on info wars.com of course we have a report State Department doesn't know
[54:27.380 --> 54:31.860]  legal authority behind Obama's green light to attack Syrian troops we're
[54:31.860 --> 54:35.940]  gonna talk about this in the next hour we've got some clips a back-and-forth
[54:35.940 --> 54:40.820]  video clip between Obama and a reporter trying to nail him down on the
[54:40.820 --> 54:45.220]  authority for this of course they've been trying for a couple of years to start
[54:45.220 --> 54:48.420]  a war against Syria to get a declaration of war or just to get
[54:48.420 --> 54:51.900]  justification for the authorization of use of military force or just to turn
[54:51.900 --> 54:57.700]  public opinion around and of course we've seen that in the sarin gas attacks
[54:57.700 --> 55:04.900]  that were exposed to not be from the Syrian forces and we've seen many
[55:04.900 --> 55:08.900]  different efforts to essentially turn the United States into the Air Force for
[55:08.900 --> 55:15.020]  al-Qaeda we've had former congressmen setting congressmen point that out and
[55:15.020 --> 55:18.100]  of course now that is exactly what's happening they've announced that they
[55:18.100 --> 55:24.700]  are going to use jets to strike any pro rebel pro u.s. rebel forces that are
[55:24.700 --> 55:27.140]  under attack by the Syrian government in other words they're giving themselves
[55:27.140 --> 55:34.180]  carte blanche to do airstrikes there at the same time we've got UK forces the
[55:34.180 --> 55:39.140]  SAS dressing up as ISIS and we know that the u.s. has been involved in giving
[55:39.140 --> 55:45.140]  material as well as training to these rebels as a way to take down the Syrian
[55:45.140 --> 55:48.460]  government they're quietly stepping up this war they have no authority to do
[55:48.460 --> 55:55.380]  it this is all just an executive order war some of these other articles and I
[55:55.380 --> 56:01.060]  think show us how the u.s. government cannot ever get enough information about
[56:01.060 --> 56:05.100]  the rest of us we've got u.s. researchers show the computers can be hijacked to
[56:05.100 --> 56:09.820]  send data as sound waves this is a team of security researchers have demonstrated
[56:09.820 --> 56:13.140]  the ability to hijack standard equipment inside computers printers and
[56:13.140 --> 56:17.940]  millions of other devices in order to send information out of an office via
[56:17.940 --> 56:22.540]  sound waves that may or may not be audible this is something we don't
[56:22.540 --> 56:26.780]  really realize how much surveillance the government has been capable of both
[56:26.780 --> 56:33.140]  technologically and by their ignoring our laws against this kind of violation of
[56:33.140 --> 56:36.420]  our privacy this has been going on things like this for a very long time I
[56:36.420 --> 56:41.140]  remember back in the early 80s when I was working as an engineer they called it
[56:41.140 --> 56:46.340]  tempesting and what they would do is they would try to isolate keyboards so
[56:46.340 --> 56:51.300]  that their electronic signals could not be monitored they had already
[56:51.300 --> 56:55.940]  developed on the u.s. side the ability to eavesdrop inside of a building and
[56:55.940 --> 57:00.380]  listen to the electronic signals that were being sent out by the keyboards if
[57:00.380 --> 57:05.780]  they weren't properly isolated electromagnetically and then determine
[57:05.780 --> 57:09.660]  what people were typing that's what's been going on for a very very long time
[57:09.660 --> 57:14.420]  again some more hacked emails from WikiLeaks showing that Boeing wants to
[57:14.420 --> 57:19.140]  use drones to hack computers from the sky this is Boeing and the hacking team
[57:19.140 --> 57:23.100]  that company that's been the news lately Milan Italy based company that's
[57:23.100 --> 57:26.220]  criticized for selling surveillance software to repressive governments
[57:26.220 --> 57:30.660]  Boeing and the hacking team were in talks earlier this year to plant malware
[57:30.660 --> 57:35.020]  on drones to perform such activities according to emails which were also
[57:35.020 --> 57:39.220]  stolen from the hacking team in July maybe they need a better hacking team
[57:39.220 --> 57:42.900]  they might want to ally with somebody this a little bit more sophisticated but
[57:42.900 --> 57:47.220]  just as we pointed out yesterday this is not as the Washington Post puts this
[57:47.220 --> 57:50.820]  out they start to build a scenario they always say oh this is let's let's
[57:50.820 --> 57:56.540]  consider this scenario a highly desired al-qaeda operative is on the lamb so
[57:56.540 --> 58:01.700]  we're going to fly a drone over and listen to them this is pure BS as we
[58:01.700 --> 58:07.260]  point out yesterday the vast majority of the espionage that our government is
[58:07.260 --> 58:13.740]  doing is corporate espionage this is the benefit of US corporations that are
[58:13.740 --> 58:17.580]  highly connected within the US government getting them information about
[58:17.580 --> 58:21.220]  their European competitors and other people stealing trade secrets and then
[58:21.220 --> 58:24.260]  of course there's the other aspect that we're all concerned about very much as
[58:24.260 --> 58:27.980]  well and that is the aspect of population control but they're going to tell you
[58:27.980 --> 58:31.580]  it's all about getting those al-qaeda terrorists you know the same people just
[58:31.580 --> 58:37.140]  like ISIS that they equip and created stay with us we'll be right back

[01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:24.180]  network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:28.620]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host on this
[01:00:28.620 --> 01:00:33.980]  Wednesday August 15th August 5th 2015 some of the stories that are coming up
[01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:37.040]  today of course we've been talking about Cecil Lyon for the last couple of
[01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:40.860]  weeks as opposed to the mainstream media talking about what's going on with
[01:00:40.860 --> 01:00:45.980]  Planned Parenthood for example as opposed to the police brutality and I've said
[01:00:45.980 --> 01:00:51.440]  that this is actually not Cecil Lyon but Cecil the red herring a distraction to
[01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:56.500]  take us away from Planned Parenthood and that's the point of the article from
[01:00:56.500 --> 01:01:00.540]  the new American feds investigating Cecil Lyon's killer but Planned Parenthood
[01:01:00.540 --> 01:01:05.500]  of course is still in the clear the hunter is now the hunted now this brings
[01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:09.980]  up a question as to not only are they trying to distract us from looking at
[01:01:09.980 --> 01:01:16.580]  the obvious and horrendous story behind Planned Parenthood trying to distract us
[01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:22.660]  from looking at those who are not doing trophy hunting but are basically killing
[01:01:22.660 --> 01:01:26.940]  children selling their body parts for a lot of money so they can get their
[01:01:26.940 --> 01:01:31.420]  trophy cars or trophy houses but it also brings up a lot of other issues of
[01:01:31.420 --> 01:01:36.540]  hypocrisy even beyond that we've seen airlines say now that they are not going
[01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:42.060]  to fly any parts that are any trophy lions they're not going to allow them
[01:01:42.060 --> 01:01:44.860]  on their airlines Delta is the most recent one to say that's not going to
[01:01:44.860 --> 01:01:50.380]  happen will they stop flights to Zimbabwe will they stop flights because of
[01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:55.700]  Mugabe who has hunted white farmers to extinction in his country who has
[01:01:55.700 --> 01:02:00.780]  impoverished the black people who remain there so that they make about 19
[01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:05.900]  dollars a week per capita that's the per capita income there Mugabe who has
[01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:11.060]  killed about 80% of the wildlife there who for his own birthday ate a baby
[01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:16.180]  elephant as you can see right there and had a trophy lion presented to him as
[01:02:16.180 --> 01:02:21.740]  well but there's yet another aspect of this and that is is this yet another
[01:02:21.740 --> 01:02:27.140]  ask another way to come after hunting itself and indirectly the second
[01:02:27.140 --> 01:02:30.980]  amendment that's where a lot of these people are going of course and that was
[01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:34.540]  really where red herrings began in the first place trying to stop fox hunting
[01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:39.340]  in the UK by the anti-hunting activists coming out and dragging a stinky fish
[01:02:39.340 --> 01:02:43.540]  across the trail so they couldn't do that and they eventually banned fox hunting
[01:02:43.540 --> 01:02:49.420]  there and regardless of what your your feelings are about hunting you need to
[01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:53.540]  understand as the person who defended getting that trophy lion for Robert
[01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:58.380]  Mugabe you need to understand that these lions who have been who are older who
[01:02:58.380 --> 01:03:03.620]  are kicked out of the pride become predators not only of farm animals but
[01:03:03.620 --> 01:03:08.100]  they become predators of humans as well and so they have hunted them they could
[01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:14.060]  have hunting expeditions in a way that would help to preserve wildlife but not
[01:03:14.060 --> 01:03:18.500]  in a kleptocracy like the one that Robert Mugabe runs in Zimbabwe but of
[01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:23.820]  course no boycotting of him simply going after the hunter even lion aid says
[01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:27.440]  this they say it'll be difficult to prosecute the person who paid for the
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:31.700]  hunt because he did what the professional hunters told him to do they
[01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:35.260]  say a client usually has no idea about the laws and regulations of the country
[01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:38.580]  that he's hunting and he just buys a safari then places himself in the hands
[01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:43.380]  of his professional hunter guide finding the client would be interesting to let
[01:03:43.380 --> 01:03:47.180]  him tell his side of the story but in terms of legal prosecution the person
[01:03:47.180 --> 01:03:51.180]  is hardly important they say and then of course there's also the issue that he
[01:03:51.180 --> 01:03:56.700]  paid a vast amount of money to this kleptocrat Robert Mugabe for the hunt
[01:03:56.700 --> 01:04:00.500]  so he paid permission for the hunt he had professional hunters he doesn't know
[01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:04.940]  what the laws are there but we need to be more concerned about that than we
[01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:08.420]  are about the people who are killed on the streets about the babies who are
[01:04:08.420 --> 01:04:13.060]  killed in the Planned Parenthood clinics another article severe crackdown in
[01:04:13.060 --> 01:04:19.220]  China on church crosses draws a backlash this is about a dozen their churches all
[01:04:19.220 --> 01:04:24.580]  over all over China where they are physically cutting down the crosses
[01:04:24.580 --> 01:04:29.020]  isn't that interesting I look at this and I think how long is it going to be
[01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:32.140]  before this type of thing is happening in the United States because when people
[01:04:32.140 --> 01:04:35.700]  become as ignorant about Christianity as they are about the history of the so-called

[01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:28.660]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host we're gonna be
[01:08:28.660 --> 01:08:31.860]  joined at the bottom of the hour with Joe Biggs he's gonna come in and talk
[01:08:31.860 --> 01:08:34.980]  about this shooting that's going on in Mississippi as well as we're going to
[01:08:34.980 --> 01:08:40.780]  look at ISIS and what is happening in Syria our government is stepping this
[01:08:40.780 --> 01:08:45.060]  up to a level of war this has been going on for quite some time they've served
[01:08:45.060 --> 01:08:48.500]  notice that they're going to be doing airstrikes they feel justified to do
[01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:55.860]  it if pro-us rebels that would be ISIS people like Al Qaeda that McCain has been
[01:08:55.860 --> 01:08:59.740]  supporting do you understand of course when we look at the elections that we
[01:08:59.740 --> 01:09:03.980]  would have gotten this war in Syria with McCain just as we're getting it now
[01:09:03.980 --> 01:09:09.340]  with Obama we would have gotten Obamacare with Romney just as we got it
[01:09:09.340 --> 01:09:14.620]  with Obama I mean these guys they always offer us this false choice it's
[01:09:14.620 --> 01:09:20.060]  simply a demographic choice that's all it really is because they make sure that
[01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:24.100]  they have control of both sides of the argument we're gonna be talking a lot
[01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:26.820]  about the Republicans later this week because that debate is going to be
[01:09:26.820 --> 01:09:31.340]  coming up I want to talk a little bit about Clinton right now Hillary Clinton
[01:09:31.340 --> 01:09:34.980]  there's a lot of articles that were on the drudge report about Hillary Clinton
[01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:37.820]  let's take a look at some of these headlines FBI looking into the security
[01:09:37.820 --> 01:09:41.660]  of Hillary Clinton's private email setup so now the FBI is taking a look at it
[01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:45.420]  don't know if there's going to be any criminal investigation nevertheless
[01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:49.940]  because we've seen the IRS getting away with us the IRS can go to Congress and
[01:09:49.940 --> 01:09:53.740]  they can lie about how the hard disks were destroyed they can lie about how
[01:09:53.740 --> 01:09:58.060]  they had no backups and then we can find out that they actually had a parallel
[01:09:58.060 --> 01:10:02.780]  texting system that they had put in look these are the people who are
[01:10:02.780 --> 01:10:08.740]  consuming the massive intelligence of the that is that is being sucked up
[01:10:08.740 --> 01:10:12.900]  about the American people they are the consumers they very well know what the
[01:10:12.900 --> 01:10:17.500]  surveillance state is about they're reading all of this stuff so when they
[01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:22.220]  start doing things that are illegal when they start doing things that they know
[01:10:22.220 --> 01:10:26.540]  they can get in trouble with but maybe with somebody if somebody ever gets in
[01:10:26.540 --> 01:10:28.900]  charge that actually cares what the law is anymore
[01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:31.180]  nevertheless they want to try to hide this up they don't want to have any
[01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:35.020]  culpability so when they know that they're going to do something illegal
[01:10:35.020 --> 01:10:37.820]  these people who know what the surveillance state is these people who
[01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:41.660]  are the consumers of the surveillance state they set up their parallel systems
[01:10:41.660 --> 01:10:45.060]  whether it's the IRS setting up their parallel texting system or whether it's
[01:10:45.060 --> 01:10:49.180]  Hillary Clinton setting up her parallel private email security system they're
[01:10:49.180 --> 01:10:55.100]  doing this deliberately you know Carly Fiorina and the when they went to the
[01:10:55.100 --> 01:10:59.660]  Saturday to talk to the Koch brothers we it was a private meeting but we heard
[01:10:59.660 --> 01:11:03.260]  some of the comments were leaked out and she had one of the best jokes at that
[01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:07.740]  she said Clinton was so technologically backward that she had chosen a couple of
[01:11:07.740 --> 01:11:13.900]  secret service agents to guard her servers no she's not she's not ignorant
[01:11:13.900 --> 01:11:19.540]  she's just criminal she's criminal she knows because she's a consumer of this
[01:11:19.540 --> 01:11:24.380]  dragnet surveillance she's one of these people she knows exactly what's going on
[01:11:24.380 --> 01:11:28.540]  with this and of course there's not just questions about that server but it's
[01:11:28.540 --> 01:11:35.140]  also questions about her close aide Huma Abedin who was not only involved now
[01:11:35.140 --> 01:11:39.820]  with these emails but we also see there's other questions surfacing about Huma
[01:11:39.820 --> 01:11:45.300]  she was paid given the $33,000 payout from the State Department for unused
[01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:49.900]  leave she's using her simultaneous employment inside and outside of the
[01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:53.860]  government to deliver favors to Clinton cronies say some people who are
[01:11:53.860 --> 01:11:58.860]  alleging that she's been doing this since 2008 they say that Ms. Abedin and Ms.
[01:11:58.860 --> 01:12:02.020]  Mills used private email accounts for official business just like their boss
[01:12:02.020 --> 01:12:06.740]  whose secretive email set up with private accounts hosted on a server Mrs.
[01:12:06.740 --> 01:12:10.740]  Clinton's home in New York has raised questions about her skirting yeah skirting
[01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:15.580]  open the pants skirt pantsuit lady is skirting open record laws and
[01:12:15.580 --> 01:12:20.100]  mishandling classified information they say Huma planned a party for Clinton
[01:12:20.100 --> 01:12:24.940]  Powell's on the taxpayer dime this is New York Post they say that and here's
[01:12:24.940 --> 01:12:28.100]  some of the emails that they found she says I have the packet with the floor
[01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:33.020]  the pentone color options in the floor plan my bigger problem right now is I
[01:12:33.020 --> 01:12:37.460]  can't even get into my Clinton email and I wanted to print all the latest
[01:12:37.460 --> 01:12:43.620]  documents to go through line by line with Oscar whatever they learned to
[01:12:43.620 --> 01:12:48.620]  design both Abedin and Clinton's Chelsea Clinton's wedding dresses these are the
[01:12:48.620 --> 01:12:55.220]  elitist crony capitalist that run our government the criminals okay this would
[01:12:55.220 --> 01:13:01.300]  be called corruption in any other time in any other country now it's called
[01:13:01.300 --> 01:13:04.580]  standard operating procedure they say an internal State Department probe
[01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:08.340]  recently found that Abedin got paid with taxpayer funds for days that she was
[01:13:08.340 --> 01:13:12.380]  working with the Clinton Foundation and while she was vacationing in Europe with
[01:13:12.380 --> 01:13:17.380]  her hubby Anthony the wiener the State Department has asked her to repay the
[01:13:17.380 --> 01:13:21.460]  money but she is contesting the findings Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck
[01:13:21.460 --> 01:13:24.500]  Grassley wrote the State Department demanding more information about her
[01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:29.660]  quote-unquote special government employee status that says that she is
[01:13:29.660 --> 01:13:35.660]  somebody with very unique skills that can hold three jobs from the government
[01:13:35.660 --> 01:13:42.220]  simultaneously and also get paid off in the private sector as well now Hillary
[01:13:42.220 --> 01:13:46.780]  Clinton is seeing all this stuff and of course how do we how does she portray
[01:13:46.780 --> 01:13:50.660]  herself as one of the people you know she talked about how after after coming
[01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:54.860]  out of the White House she and Bill were just so incredibly poor you know
[01:13:54.860 --> 01:13:59.260]  these people who had nothing and became multimillionaires off the political
[01:13:59.260 --> 01:14:04.740]  process they were just you know abjectly poor nobody was buying it nobody is
[01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:08.820]  buying all this stuff as I've mentioned before the onion is running articles
[01:14:08.820 --> 01:14:14.100]  making fun of her arrogance talking about how the FEC has put her on three
[01:14:14.100 --> 01:14:17.060]  weeks probation where she's not allowed to campaign because they caught her
[01:14:17.060 --> 01:14:22.380]  spitting on campaign volunteers so here's what she's doing now she's trying
[01:14:22.380 --> 01:14:25.580]  to portray as we pointed out yesterday we showed the video that she's running
[01:14:25.580 --> 01:14:30.340]  showing her mother because Hillary Clinton now wants you choice to reinvent
[01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:34.260]  herself to change her image because this is all about identity politics folks
[01:14:34.260 --> 01:14:38.300]  you're not going to get any difference between the policies of Hillary Clinton
[01:14:38.300 --> 01:14:42.180]  and the policies of Jeb Bush they're going to own both sides of that just like
[01:14:42.180 --> 01:14:46.780]  they did McCain and Obama and Obama and Romney so now she's reinventing herself
[01:14:46.780 --> 01:14:50.660]  as a grandmother I want to play a clip for you where she's not only going to be
[01:14:50.660 --> 01:14:55.820]  a grandmother but a southern granny let's play that southern granny clip
[01:14:55.820 --> 01:15:00.620]  Hillary Clinton welcome to chair chance Jamie I'm delighted to be here I you know
[01:15:00.620 --> 01:15:04.780]  I love sitting here and rocking so thanks for giving me the the chance to do
[01:15:04.780 --> 01:15:09.380]  that yeah you know you maybe what she's going to do next I think this is what
[01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:12.740]  she's tried to be trying to portray herself as a granny in her commercials
[01:15:12.740 --> 01:15:17.740]  she's going with a southern accent so maybe what we'll do is see her with her
[01:15:17.740 --> 01:15:23.500]  entourage running around instead of hiding out in a dark out van maybe what
[01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:27.620]  they'll do is put her on the back of a pickup truck like granny from the Beverly
[01:15:27.620 --> 01:15:30.980]  Hillbillies and put her in a rocking chair you know just like she was right
[01:15:30.980 --> 01:15:35.020]  there she can tell everybody how she likes to cook vitals you know the Beverly
[01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:39.100]  Hillbillies was a fish out of water comedy where you took somebody that was
[01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:42.780]  not sophisticated and you put them in a very sophisticated area she is now
[01:15:42.780 --> 01:15:46.100]  doing just the opposite she's trying to pretend somebody who is very
[01:15:46.100 --> 01:15:51.900]  sophisticated very calculating is trying to pretend that she's not she sees
[01:15:51.900 --> 01:15:56.220]  somebody who is a ruthless shark and she's trying to pretend that she's an
[01:15:56.220 --> 01:16:00.820]  innocent little granny from the Beverly Hillbillies it's not working Hillary
[01:16:00.820 --> 01:16:06.100]  Clinton and Bernie Sanders are now in a dead heat in New Hampshire I say that
[01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:10.940]  Bernie Sanders is pulling 42 or she's pulling 42% and Bernie Sanders is
[01:16:10.940 --> 01:16:18.060]  pulling 36% in the latest horse race poll coming out of New Hampshire that's
[01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:21.920]  pretty amazing isn't it when you can have a felonious elitist like Hillary
[01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:27.820]  Clinton still beating Bernie Sanders that doesn't look good for the Democrats
[01:16:27.820 --> 01:16:32.260]  but of course on the Republican side there's a lot of problems as well the
[01:16:32.260 --> 01:16:36.100]  stock market is not doing well the bad news on the Apple stock is only the
[01:16:36.100 --> 01:16:40.700]  beginning they say and of course I think this has a lot to do with the CEO of
[01:16:40.700 --> 01:16:45.260]  Apple Tim Cook being more interested and being an activist for gay rights than
[01:16:45.260 --> 01:16:48.740]  he is in terms of doing any kind of product development we saw how this
[01:16:48.740 --> 01:16:53.300]  happened before for Apple although now it's going to have a lot of massive
[01:16:53.300 --> 01:16:56.340]  consequences for the entire stock market because they're now part of the
[01:16:56.340 --> 01:17:01.380]  Dow Jones industrial market I remember back when he was run out of the company
[01:17:01.380 --> 01:17:06.020]  by John Scully who worked for Pepsi they wanted somebody in who was going to be a
[01:17:06.020 --> 01:17:11.660]  marketing type he wasn't a product guy he wasn't a visionary and when they ran
[01:17:11.660 --> 01:17:15.940]  him out it didn't take very long for Apple to get on the ropes I remember
[01:17:15.940 --> 01:17:21.100]  just before Steve Jobs came back all the writing in the technical journals and
[01:17:21.100 --> 01:17:24.260]  places like Wired Magazine they were saying well I think Apple ought to just
[01:17:24.260 --> 01:17:29.140]  sell off their hardware business and they need to reinvent themselves just as
[01:17:29.140 --> 01:17:33.100]  an operating system company like Microsoft and they would make more money
[01:17:33.100 --> 01:17:39.460]  but Steve Jobs came back they came back as an interim CEO he had the title I
[01:17:39.460 --> 01:17:45.140]  CEO and then he made the iPod the iMac and all these other products he was a
[01:17:45.140 --> 01:17:49.060]  genius in terms of editing things he never really created anything but he
[01:17:49.060 --> 01:17:52.940]  really knew how to get things going I think when you look at history there's
[01:17:52.940 --> 01:17:55.900]  a lot of different approaches looking at history there's a cyclical approach I
[01:17:55.900 --> 01:18:01.380]  think that's a very valid approach we've talked about how the the book by
[01:18:01.380 --> 01:18:06.580]  Ernst and let's see Strauss and how Strauss and how about the fourth
[01:18:06.580 --> 01:18:09.540]  turning that goes back and looks at the cyclical nature of history I think
[01:18:09.540 --> 01:18:15.060]  that's very true I think there's also is very important who the individuals are
[01:18:15.060 --> 01:18:20.020]  I think we can see this in the rise and fall of companies we can see that very
[01:18:20.020 --> 01:18:24.900]  very clearly now of course later this week we have the big debate that is
[01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:30.980]  coming up and we'll be covering that in depth here at Info Wars both on the
[01:18:30.980 --> 01:18:35.180]  radio show and in the nightly news here's an analysis of who has made the
[01:18:35.180 --> 01:18:38.900]  final cut because they have now talked about the 10 candidates that are going
[01:18:38.900 --> 01:18:43.940]  to be in that cut and they go down on a point-by-point basis from USA Today
[01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:49.300]  Susan Page says here's here's what they need to do according to her Donald
[01:18:49.300 --> 01:18:54.460]  Trump let the Donald be Donald well yeah he's not afraid to speak truth to power
[01:18:54.460 --> 01:18:58.300]  that's why he's become so popular and I think he's got a lot of the right
[01:18:58.300 --> 01:19:03.020]  policies my questions with Donald Trump really boiled down to his ethics can we
[01:19:03.020 --> 01:19:07.260]  trust him to do what he says you know we just trusted the Republicans to do
[01:19:07.260 --> 01:19:11.940]  what they would say less than a year ago what is it about ten months ago nine
[01:19:11.940 --> 01:19:16.940]  months ago that we reelected them and they did nothing that they said they
[01:19:16.940 --> 01:19:21.060]  were going to do so can we trust Donald Trump to do it that's my issue with him
[01:19:21.060 --> 01:19:25.860]  I think he needs to establish the fact that he is trustworthy and not just in
[01:19:25.860 --> 01:19:29.820]  this for himself Jeb Bush they say be his own man essentially what they're
[01:19:29.820 --> 01:19:33.900]  saying about Donald Trump to Donald be the Donald Jeb Bush be his own man as
[01:19:33.900 --> 01:19:40.740]  opposed to the man of who the CIA Goldman Sachs Scott Walker competent well
[01:19:40.740 --> 01:19:44.940]  okay try to my cockabee remember me they say well he's gonna have to do
[01:19:44.940 --> 01:19:48.900]  something other than just come up with glib comments and approach from 20 years
[01:19:48.900 --> 01:19:53.820]  ago when they talk about Rand Paul they say well he has an alternative view of
[01:19:53.820 --> 01:19:57.700]  the world yeah strange alternative view of the world where individual rights in
[01:19:57.700 --> 01:20:00.620]  the Constitution matter that's why we're gonna watch this debate serious

[01:24:27.660 --> 01:24:32.260]  we're also gonna talk about what's going on in Syria because that is stepping up
[01:24:32.260 --> 01:24:36.220]  and we have a back-and-forth that we're gonna play for you between the State
[01:24:36.220 --> 01:24:41.980]  Department and a reporter asking for the legal authority to attack Syrian troops
[01:24:41.980 --> 01:24:47.300]  because they are step-by-step stepping this up into a full-blown war and making
[01:24:47.300 --> 01:24:50.180]  no bones about it saying they're gonna use airstrikes and so forth and are
[01:24:50.180 --> 01:24:53.540]  doing that now so we're gonna talk to Joe Biggs about that when we come back

[01:25:58.460 --> 01:26:02.540]  when we ran out of time at the break of USA today is analyzing these ten
[01:26:02.540 --> 01:26:05.900]  candidates that are going to be on the debate on Thursday and of course we've
[01:26:05.900 --> 01:26:09.140]  got Donald Trump is the one at top they say let Donald be Donald
[01:26:09.140 --> 01:26:13.580]  Jeb Bush be his own man in other words the kind of the same advice on all these
[01:26:13.580 --> 01:26:18.180]  guys Scott Walker will be there Mike Huckabee and I gotta say you know the
[01:26:18.180 --> 01:26:21.980]  glib comments that I see from Huckabee when we're facing the kind of severe
[01:26:21.980 --> 01:26:26.940]  problems that we are in this this country I just doesn't resonate with me
[01:26:26.940 --> 01:26:31.940]  it's just a cognitive dissonance to see that and the fact that he would defend
[01:26:31.940 --> 01:26:37.100]  innocent life is good but at the same time he is such an incredible warmonger
[01:26:37.100 --> 01:26:41.220]  along with Lindsey Graham and that dissonance there I find that very
[01:26:41.220 --> 01:26:46.700]  disturbing very very bothering to see somebody a former pastor promoting war
[01:26:46.700 --> 01:26:50.460]  to the extent that Mike Huckabee does Ben Carson they say he needs to show
[01:26:50.460 --> 01:26:53.420]  people that he's not just a doctor yeah he needs to show people that he really
[01:26:53.420 --> 01:26:56.900]  has read the Constitution I haven't seen much evidence of that that he
[01:26:56.900 --> 01:26:59.620]  understands the Constitution that he understands the principles involved
[01:26:59.620 --> 01:27:03.180]  this is somebody who when it came to the Second Amendment has previously said
[01:27:03.180 --> 01:27:07.500]  that he thought that it was fine for people who live out in the country but
[01:27:07.500 --> 01:27:12.580]  people in the city don't need to have guns that's pretty amazing pretty amazing
[01:27:12.580 --> 01:27:17.180]  you don't understand the principles you don't understand the law okay so you
[01:27:17.180 --> 01:27:19.820]  need to take a look at that he's also somebody who has pushed for mandatory
[01:27:19.820 --> 01:27:24.900]  vaccines he's a doctor and he thinks he understands what vaccines are about but
[01:27:24.900 --> 01:27:29.380]  he certainly doesn't know the first thing about our rights and our informed
[01:27:29.380 --> 01:27:34.540]  consent nor does he respect that Ted Cruz they say Trump but with electoral
[01:27:34.540 --> 01:27:38.300]  experience yeah he likes to get out there and say controversial things speak
[01:27:38.300 --> 01:27:44.180]  his mind he has electoral experience but he is not eligible to run for
[01:27:44.180 --> 01:27:47.740]  president if you look at the natural born citizen requirements Marco Rubio
[01:27:47.740 --> 01:27:52.300]  needs to get back in the game he's just running for vice presidents all I think
[01:27:52.300 --> 01:27:56.260]  about Marco Rubio and again he is down the line your typical middle of the
[01:27:56.260 --> 01:28:01.100]  road GOP warmongering statist authoritarian Rand Paul they say an
[01:28:01.100 --> 01:28:04.140]  alternative view of the world and as I said it would be nice to hear an
[01:28:04.140 --> 01:28:08.980]  alternative to the kinds of policies that Marco Rubio and most of the GOP
[01:28:08.980 --> 01:28:13.420]  advocate and that's precisely what we heard a little bit of on Monday night we
[01:28:13.420 --> 01:28:17.700]  played that very some excerpts from that very boring forum in New Hampshire
[01:28:17.700 --> 01:28:21.620]  where they asked Rand Paul about drag net surveillance and then asked Marco
[01:28:21.620 --> 01:28:25.180]  Rubio about it of course Marco Rubio gave us the tired old excuses we always
[01:28:25.180 --> 01:28:29.900]  hear from the GOP it's all about national security we've seen so many I
[01:28:29.900 --> 01:28:34.100]  can tell you being on the inside he says I've seen so many attacks that we
[01:28:34.100 --> 01:28:38.420]  have shut down bologna bologna and I say whistleblowers have told us that's
[01:28:38.420 --> 01:28:41.860]  bologna they told us they had the infill they could have stopped what was
[01:28:41.860 --> 01:28:46.180]  going on with 9-11 they Joe chose not to they don't do that they only make
[01:28:46.180 --> 01:28:49.700]  their haystack to find their needle they only make it bigger with all of these
[01:28:49.700 --> 01:28:54.540]  issues and of course we know about how the FBI manufactures so many of these
[01:28:54.540 --> 01:28:57.860]  threats that they go public with Chris Christie they say you want somebody
[01:28:57.860 --> 01:29:02.620]  that's combative get Chris Christie well you know I don't know I for one I think a
[01:29:02.620 --> 01:29:05.660]  lot of people have had enough of belligerence just for the sake of
[01:29:05.660 --> 01:29:09.060]  belligerence it was this weekend and we talk about how this is a horse race it
[01:29:09.060 --> 01:29:12.540]  was just this weekend that Chris Christie they say this is Business Insider
[01:29:12.540 --> 01:29:17.780]  got mercilessly booed at a horse race in New Jersey interestingly enough it was
[01:29:17.780 --> 01:29:21.300]  at that same track Monmouth track that we were playing those clips of the
[01:29:21.300 --> 01:29:26.220]  horse race from earlier and I think it's very fitting he came out very
[01:29:26.220 --> 01:29:31.740]  belligerently against states rights saying that if he becomes president he's
[01:29:31.740 --> 01:29:36.980]  going to stop the decriminalization of marijuana that's gone on in places I
[01:29:36.980 --> 01:29:40.140]  tell you what this is the question that I would ask any of these guys if I was a
[01:29:40.140 --> 01:29:44.100]  guy can the government ban anything that's an article up on info wars.com
[01:29:44.100 --> 01:29:47.940]  you need to read that because they don't have the authority stay with us be
[01:29:47.940 --> 01:29:53.820]  right back with your bigs we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones
[01:29:53.820 --> 01:30:03.900]  and the GCN radio network. Keyboard tough guys flex their imaginary muscles as they
[01:30:03.900 --> 01:30:07.780]  use the PlayStation 4 in their mother's basement to step into the digital
[01:30:07.780 --> 01:30:13.020]  octagon with Rowdy Rhonda Rousey in the wake of a knockout performance at UFC
[01:30:13.020 --> 01:30:17.780]  190 social justice warriors just couldn't take hearing any more about Rousey
[01:30:17.780 --> 01:30:23.060]  being a strong female role model they attacked Rousey over the internet for her
[01:30:23.060 --> 01:30:27.900]  past comments regarding transgender MMA fighter Fallon Fox calling the rowdy one
[01:30:27.900 --> 01:30:33.340]  a transphobic Rousey said in regards to Fox she can try hormones chop her pecker
[01:30:33.340 --> 01:30:37.300]  off but it's still the same bone structure a man has it's an advantage
[01:30:37.300 --> 01:30:41.700]  and I don't think it's fair upon hearing this the digital dominators put up
[01:30:41.700 --> 01:30:46.100]  their two hands only to use their two thumbs and win a full five rounds with
[01:30:46.100 --> 01:30:50.420]  Rhonda on Twitter saying things like Rhonda Rousey thinks trans women are
[01:30:50.420 --> 01:30:54.620]  men how dare you speak that common sense Rhonda you can find more reports on

[01:33:15.820 --> 01:33:25.820]  live from Austin Texas it's Alex Jones
[01:33:25.820 --> 01:33:30.140]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host on this Wednesday
[01:33:30.140 --> 01:33:35.460]  August 5th 2015 joining me now is Joe Biggs and Joe is here to give us an
[01:33:35.460 --> 01:33:38.460]  update on what's going on in Mississippi of course shots were fired
[01:33:38.460 --> 01:33:44.020]  yesterday and again today at Camp Shelby Joe what's the update on this well the
[01:33:44.020 --> 01:33:48.300]  thing we got to think about is is this a paranoid person who actually has been
[01:33:48.300 --> 01:33:52.580]  watching all these YouTube videos saying that Jade Helm was going to
[01:33:52.580 --> 01:33:58.820]  essentially just come after everyone individually and take them and put them
[01:33:58.820 --> 01:34:04.020]  in FEMA camps or is this just a random act I mean because this is two days now
[01:34:04.020 --> 01:34:09.940]  a red truck they haven't got anybody and then now just about an hour ago they've
[01:34:09.940 --> 01:34:13.460]  detained a guy who was in a red truck he said he didn't have any guns and his
[01:34:13.460 --> 01:34:17.020]  truck was backfire and so now you have these cops just pulling over everyone
[01:34:17.020 --> 01:34:21.300]  in a red truck in Hadesburg right outside of a camp Shelby you got a red
[01:34:21.300 --> 01:34:24.420]  truck here so if you got a red truck you're like if you got a white van
[01:34:24.420 --> 01:34:27.780]  you're a suspect and there's a gazillion white man it's like when you're in Iraq
[01:34:27.780 --> 01:34:31.900]  everything is a Toyota Corolla yeah every car is you have to be on a watch
[01:34:31.900 --> 01:34:34.580]  for a Toyota Corolla and that's the only car they have well of course the other
[01:34:34.580 --> 01:34:37.780]  aspect of this too that a lot of people concerned about is is this going to be
[01:34:37.780 --> 01:34:40.700]  we always have to be concerned that there's a false flag but it's still a
[01:34:40.700 --> 01:34:43.700]  risk to the people who were there you know whether it's a false flag or
[01:34:43.700 --> 01:34:46.940]  somebody that's paranoid about it or somebody that is you know we were told
[01:34:46.940 --> 01:34:50.300]  they're saying that it's a white man in a red pickup truck but we were told that
[01:34:50.300 --> 01:34:53.660]  about the shootings at the recruiting stations as well they were he was
[01:34:53.660 --> 01:34:58.260]  identified as a white man turned out that he was an Islamic jihadi they have
[01:34:58.260 --> 01:35:03.380]  no problem they have no problem identifying a white man but you know
[01:35:03.380 --> 01:35:06.700]  they'll never want to call it what it is like we can never say extremism we
[01:35:06.700 --> 01:35:10.540]  can never say you know Islamic extremism but if it's a white guy we
[01:35:10.540 --> 01:35:13.220]  go ahead and throw that on the table that's easy we can throw that out right
[01:35:13.220 --> 01:35:17.420]  away even when it's not true and then when it is true this guy Muhammad was an
[01:35:17.420 --> 01:35:21.700]  Islamic jihadi who hated these guys and clearly this wasn't that he just pulled
[01:35:21.700 --> 01:35:24.340]  up and decided that he were going to mass shooting spree and it just happened
[01:35:24.340 --> 01:35:28.180]  to be at a recruiting station he shot up the one recruiting station goes to
[01:35:28.180 --> 01:35:31.060]  another location and shoots that up another recruiting so he's obviously
[01:35:31.060 --> 01:35:35.380]  targeting the military he's obviously talked online about being a jihadi but
[01:35:35.380 --> 01:35:38.940]  they can't go there they won't talk about that it's not extreme apparently that's
[01:35:38.940 --> 01:35:43.340]  just a workplace violence again we have another story that we haven't talked
[01:35:43.340 --> 01:35:46.260]  about yet really CVS Denver is reporting that the FBI says there's
[01:35:46.260 --> 01:35:49.860]  Middle Eastern men intimidating US military families in Colorado and
[01:35:49.860 --> 01:35:53.540]  Wyoming they say an alert has been issued by the FBI all law enforcement
[01:35:53.540 --> 01:35:58.100]  agencies in Colorado and Wyoming involving US military families concerns
[01:35:58.100 --> 01:36:02.540]  about who may be watching them they say in this particular case last May for
[01:36:02.540 --> 01:36:06.340]  example there's been some additional ones recently the wife of a military
[01:36:06.340 --> 01:36:09.660]  member was approached in front of her home by two Middle Eastern males the men
[01:36:09.660 --> 01:36:13.780]  stated that she was a wife of a US interrogator so I said your your
[01:36:13.780 --> 01:36:17.460]  husband's a US interrogator they confront her about that when she denied
[01:36:17.460 --> 01:36:22.020]  their claims they laughed at her then left the area in a sedan with two other
[01:36:22.020 --> 01:36:26.620]  Middle Eastern males in the in the vehicle they say that that vehicle been
[01:36:26.620 --> 01:36:30.100]  seen in the neighborhood on previous occasions as well similar incidents in
[01:36:30.100 --> 01:36:34.940]  Wyoming have been reported to the FBI throughout June 2015 and then there is
[01:36:34.940 --> 01:36:39.340]  this notice that they have embedded in the report at CVS that is dated 2nd
[01:36:39.340 --> 01:36:43.820]  July 2015 Middle Eastern males approaching family members of US military
[01:36:43.820 --> 01:36:50.380]  personnel at their homes in Colorado and Wyoming as of June 2015 well so this is
[01:36:50.380 --> 01:36:55.460]  real then yeah because if the FBI had a hand in this they would have already
[01:36:55.460 --> 01:36:58.660]  busted it because they would have set the people up and then we've already had
[01:36:58.660 --> 01:37:02.220]  arrests by now so this makes me think this is an actual legitimate threat
[01:37:02.220 --> 01:37:06.420]  there's something going on because when it's real the FBI is nowhere to be seen
[01:37:06.420 --> 01:37:10.540]  they can't do their job it's an actual legitimate threat these people they've
[01:37:10.540 --> 01:37:15.300]  seen the same vehicle and the same people in their area numerous times and
[01:37:15.300 --> 01:37:18.900]  yet the FBI can't get them just been going on for over a year and they're not
[01:37:18.900 --> 01:37:23.260]  doing anything about it and this is small-town USA about there's a lot of
[01:37:23.260 --> 01:37:27.620]  them on Tana driving around in the same vehicle yeah exactly now and this is
[01:37:27.620 --> 01:37:30.180]  interesting I think too because we look at the fact that just recently we've
[01:37:30.180 --> 01:37:34.900]  had these massive hacks of federal employee databases even getting I think
[01:37:34.900 --> 01:37:37.620]  it was four and a half million fingerprints I mean if you can get
[01:37:37.620 --> 01:37:41.020]  somebody's fingerprints you can certainly find out what their jobs are
[01:37:41.020 --> 01:37:45.260]  within the military I mean it's easy when the government collects everything on
[01:37:45.260 --> 01:37:49.420]  people it makes everybody vulnerable even the people who work for the
[01:37:49.420 --> 01:37:53.220]  government Joe I remember years and years ago when they first started doing
[01:37:53.220 --> 01:37:57.500]  these automated toll technology first started presenting itself I remember
[01:37:57.500 --> 01:38:02.100]  there was a debate in the Netherlands over whether they would allow this or
[01:38:02.100 --> 01:38:05.180]  not people were concerned about their privacy and they were so concerned about
[01:38:05.180 --> 01:38:09.100]  it because their government there you know being a good you know a Dutch
[01:38:09.100 --> 01:38:11.660]  government where everything is very efficient and everything they were
[01:38:11.660 --> 01:38:14.620]  keeping all the all this information about the citizens on three by five
[01:38:14.620 --> 01:38:18.940]  cards they had them packed so tightly that when the Germans came in with a
[01:38:18.940 --> 01:38:23.580]  Blitzkrieg very rapidly overtook their country they tried to destroy these
[01:38:23.580 --> 01:38:28.180]  records but they were packed so tightly they couldn't set them on fire and so the
[01:38:28.180 --> 01:38:31.820]  Nazis got all this information and just used it as a shopping list to get
[01:38:31.820 --> 01:38:34.500]  anybody that they thought might be a problem for them anybody that was
[01:38:34.500 --> 01:38:39.020]  Jewish anybody that would oppose them as a political opponent or whatever just
[01:38:39.020 --> 01:38:42.100]  use it as a shopping list to go round people up and take them to concentration
[01:38:42.100 --> 01:38:45.180]  camps and that's precisely what our government has created even for its own
[01:38:45.180 --> 01:38:49.220]  employees here well I mean also to you have operational security offset there's
[01:38:49.220 --> 01:38:52.860]  a lot of people who post information on Facebook that they just shouldn't do
[01:38:52.860 --> 01:38:56.380]  posting as well too and then understand that when you when you look at someone's
[01:38:56.380 --> 01:39:00.100]  profile and you accept that friend just because you see a picture of someone who
[01:39:00.100 --> 01:39:03.100]  looks friendly that doesn't mean that's who it is and there's a lot of these guys
[01:39:03.100 --> 01:39:07.500]  who troll these accounts and they know based on being overseas someone will get
[01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:10.540]  their name and go I start looking for this guy's Facebook account and sure
[01:39:10.540 --> 01:39:13.380]  enough you'll have guys they know I'm an interrogator for the US Army I'm this
[01:39:13.380 --> 01:39:16.580]  and that oh this is where I live they don't make anything private they don't
[01:39:16.580 --> 01:39:19.980]  they just most people don't think it'll ever happen to them and that's one way
[01:39:19.980 --> 01:39:23.180]  you can get a lot of this information too and you can come back and bite you in
[01:39:23.180 --> 01:39:27.740]  the butt well of course we see that with people who aren't in the military right
[01:39:27.740 --> 01:39:31.020]  they're talking and they and they may be talking about stuff that is perfectly
[01:39:31.020 --> 01:39:35.180]  innocent they may be talking about politics and they may get identified by
[01:39:35.180 --> 01:39:37.820]  the government as being somebody who is a threat to them that's what we're
[01:39:37.820 --> 01:39:42.100]  seeing in this latest Planned Parenthood situation where you got a CNN anchor
[01:39:42.100 --> 01:39:46.060]  using the term of art that the government had just created they're
[01:39:46.060 --> 01:39:50.980]  creating a new department under FEMA under Homeland Security that is going to
[01:39:50.980 --> 01:39:55.300]  look at violent extremists they're going to identify them as before they do
[01:39:55.300 --> 01:40:00.580]  anything just as Wesley Clark floated the trial balloon congressman McCall was
[01:40:00.580 --> 01:40:04.060]  putting in the legislation and of course it just passed through committee breeze
[01:40:04.060 --> 01:40:07.860]  through there unanimously on its way to becoming a law where they're going to
[01:40:07.860 --> 01:40:12.100]  come after people just because they identify based on their computer models
[01:40:12.100 --> 01:40:14.780]  whether or not they think you're going to be some kind of a threat to them and
[01:40:14.780 --> 01:40:17.980]  as Wesley Clark said you know you can exercise your free speech that's fine
[01:40:17.980 --> 01:40:21.260]  but we put people in prison camps and we thought were threats to us and we're
[01:40:21.260 --> 01:40:24.220]  going to put you in a prison camp if we think that you might become an
[01:40:24.220 --> 01:40:27.340]  extremist if you might become violent and some of the things that he mentioned
[01:40:27.340 --> 01:40:31.100]  off of social media where we'll say that you your girlfriend broke up with you
[01:40:31.100 --> 01:40:34.300]  you're lost your job or whatever they're looking at all of that stuff yeah
[01:40:34.300 --> 01:40:38.900]  they're saying that you're depressed you're you're drunk posting stuff and
[01:40:38.900 --> 01:40:41.540]  then they go back and look at your pictures you got pictures with guns
[01:40:41.540 --> 01:40:45.340]  everywhere and you're sitting there doing all these you know little poses like
[01:40:45.340 --> 01:40:48.860]  oh my god this guy he's about to snap yeah his girlfriend broke up with him he
[01:40:48.860 --> 01:40:52.540]  owns guns he's obviously gonna go on a violent rampage yeah let's go get this
[01:40:52.540 --> 01:40:55.940]  guy you post a lot of pictures of yourself holding guns on on the internet
[01:40:55.940 --> 01:41:00.420]  you're liable to even have them use you as a patsy and then put those pictures
[01:41:00.420 --> 01:41:04.260]  up to justify the fact look at this guy was crazy or have the VA contact you
[01:41:04.260 --> 01:41:07.540]  know what we're gonna have to take your benefits away we're no longer gonna be
[01:41:07.540 --> 01:41:13.140]  able to give you any more patient care we've deemed you you know crazy so we're
[01:41:13.140 --> 01:41:16.300]  gonna social security or social security although I don't think to me people on
[01:41:16.300 --> 01:41:18.940]  social security are really well maybe they are using social media I guess a
[01:41:18.940 --> 01:41:22.940]  lot of them are using a little bit more and more yeah well look at this also
[01:41:22.940 --> 01:41:27.140]  because we were talking about these guys Middle East individuals are contacting
[01:41:27.140 --> 01:41:32.140]  US military and making threats to them this article comes out Arabic is now
[01:41:32.140 --> 01:41:36.380]  the most common language of refugees in America there's a mess not only are we
[01:41:36.380 --> 01:41:41.900]  working with ISIS and Al Qaeda creating these organizations equipping them
[01:41:41.900 --> 01:41:45.020]  training them and we've had numerous times we've talked about that there's
[01:41:45.020 --> 01:41:49.780]  been there's been a video caught of them delivering weapons massive quantities
[01:41:49.780 --> 01:41:53.580]  by helicopter or they pull out of an area and just let these guys take it over
[01:41:53.580 --> 01:41:57.300]  but now we're stepping it up to where our government has said we're going to
[01:41:57.300 --> 01:42:02.500]  launch airstrikes against anybody that we think are pro-us rebels that's
[01:42:02.500 --> 01:42:06.820]  something Obama has been going after for a long time he is hell-bent on going
[01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:10.500]  after Syria mm-hmm they want to and it's funny because they keep doing this
[01:42:10.500 --> 01:42:16.420]  under you know the beard of the Cecil the lion the the the new plain wreckage
[01:42:16.420 --> 01:42:19.700]  stuff that's washed up on the island yeah you know but meanwhile while they're
[01:42:19.700 --> 01:42:23.180]  talking about this and everyone in the country is in tears and up in arms over
[01:42:23.180 --> 01:42:31.540]  this lion in Africa Obama is trying to put us full-on in war with Syria absolutely
[01:42:31.540 --> 01:42:34.260]  and and of course this is again going back to Wesley Clark the same guy who
[01:42:34.260 --> 01:42:38.340]  was just floating the trial balloon about locking detaining people putting
[01:42:38.340 --> 01:42:42.380]  them in prison camps like we did Japanese people just because they were
[01:42:42.380 --> 01:42:46.340]  Japanese during World War two saying that we're going to identify people put
[01:42:46.340 --> 01:42:49.620]  them way it was Wesley Clark who said that Syria was on the list he said it
[01:42:49.620 --> 01:42:52.940]  was on next on the list a long time ago he had a list of several countries that
[01:42:52.940 --> 01:42:56.620]  we were going to go to war with when we look at this article about Arabic
[01:42:56.620 --> 01:43:01.420]  they're pointing out that of the 11,300 refugees that have been admitted to the
[01:43:01.420 --> 01:43:06.180]  US this year 4,400 of them speak Arabic in other words that's more than a third
[01:43:06.180 --> 01:43:10.060]  of the people coming in so not only are these people our allies not only we
[01:43:10.060 --> 01:43:16.740]  equipping people who are rebels that are pro-us so to speak okay but just like
[01:43:16.740 --> 01:43:20.420]  we created al-Qaeda we called them the Mujahideen when we created them against
[01:43:20.420 --> 01:43:25.540]  the Russians and then Osama bin Laden became our most wanted man or whatever
[01:43:25.540 --> 01:43:29.740]  they're bringing these people who they think that they control into the United
[01:43:29.740 --> 01:43:32.340]  States now massive quantity yeah they bring them in and they also can come
[01:43:32.340 --> 01:43:36.900]  across the porous border on the south side yeah you know yeah and we've seen
[01:43:36.900 --> 01:43:41.060]  it time well these are legal these are guys that they brought in legally gave
[01:43:41.060 --> 01:43:44.460]  sanctioned to gave made them refugees and everything and of course as you point
[01:43:44.460 --> 01:43:47.300]  out we don't know how many are coming in across the board and we don't know how
[01:43:47.300 --> 01:43:50.580]  many are being legally brought in who are sleeper cells as well people who
[01:43:50.580 --> 01:43:54.180]  wait and be brought over patiently sitting there waiting it's happened
[01:43:54.180 --> 01:43:58.420]  before waiting to be activated just waiting on that one thing that they're
[01:43:58.420 --> 01:44:02.100]  told to and then they go and attack and like we showed the the drugs smuggling
[01:44:02.100 --> 01:44:05.380]  come across the the border it's not just about drugs yeah we know drugs come
[01:44:05.380 --> 01:44:09.900]  across the border every day got it but one time one of those packages could be
[01:44:09.900 --> 01:44:14.620]  a dirty bomb it's not always just drugs we know drugs are coming across but just
[01:44:14.620 --> 01:44:18.140]  as easy as I saw those seven guys come across the river with those packages
[01:44:18.140 --> 01:44:22.100]  that could be a dirty bomb that could be ISIS that could be anything because we
[01:44:22.100 --> 01:44:25.540]  have no eyes on it we're not watching and it's easy for these border patrol
[01:44:25.540 --> 01:44:28.580]  guys to get paid off to look the other way oh yeah yeah that was part of what
[01:44:28.580 --> 01:44:31.940]  you saw when you were there and of course they come in within the you know
[01:44:31.940 --> 01:44:35.540]  well into the United States border and start harassing American citizens
[01:44:35.540 --> 01:44:38.780]  demanding to know all the way our identity papers like we're not see
[01:44:38.780 --> 01:44:43.500]  Germany or something yeah let's take a look at this this video this is a state
[01:44:43.500 --> 01:44:48.500]  department fielding questions from a pretty persistent reporter asking what
[01:44:48.500 --> 01:44:53.420]  is the legal authority for us to start a war with Syria or to step up the war
[01:44:53.420 --> 01:44:56.860]  that's been going on for some time there here's that clip what is the legal
[01:44:56.860 --> 01:45:00.700]  basis for the authority that the Obama administration gave itself to attack
[01:45:00.700 --> 01:45:05.020]  anyone who's who's attacking Syrian opposition forces that the U.S.
[01:45:05.020 --> 01:45:12.020]  trying to the legal authority yes basis well you're talking about in Syria and
[01:45:12.020 --> 01:45:19.940]  in protection of the the ISIL anti-ISIL coalition fighters that in part been
[01:45:19.940 --> 01:45:25.820]  trained by the U.S. yes I frankly don't know what the legal authority is what
[01:45:25.820 --> 01:45:30.260]  we're very clear about it is that you know they're fighting and frankly a
[01:45:30.260 --> 01:45:40.460]  lawless area of Syria there in terms of they're under attack under attack and
[01:45:40.460 --> 01:45:47.020]  under pressure from a lot of different forces mostly ISIL ISIL but other
[01:45:47.020 --> 01:45:56.940]  forces as well in that region and I think I'm trying to convey and we talked
[01:45:56.940 --> 01:46:00.540]  about this yesterday as the fact that you know we're bringing airstrikes to
[01:46:00.540 --> 01:46:07.860]  bear on ISIL in that area as they advance on ISIL help territory or ISIL help
[01:46:07.860 --> 01:46:11.140]  territory and supporting them in that way and that's actually been effective
[01:46:11.140 --> 01:46:16.860]  in fighting ISIL it's a very complex and fluid situation I get that what we
[01:46:16.860 --> 01:46:24.140]  are trying to convey is that we'll also do defensive efforts in case or in the
[01:46:24.140 --> 01:46:28.740]  hypothetical that they would come under fire from Syrian forces so the the
[01:46:28.740 --> 01:46:32.180]  only thing that changed since the announcement is the authority to go
[01:46:32.180 --> 01:46:36.940]  after Assad government forces basically because the U.S. had been bombing ISIS
[01:46:36.940 --> 01:46:42.380]  targets the authority to go after clarify I said defensive measures yes but
[01:46:42.380 --> 01:46:47.980]  I'm sorry but what would be the the legal basis for attacking Syrian
[01:46:47.980 --> 01:46:52.820]  government forces is that the AUMF voted do you have congressional
[01:46:52.820 --> 01:47:00.580]  authorization for that well again we have coalition and obviously but we've
[01:47:00.580 --> 01:47:04.060]  been carrying out airstrikes in that region for many months now almost a
[01:47:04.060 --> 01:47:13.020]  year and the same in defense of these groups but also to help them gain
[01:47:13.020 --> 01:47:21.300]  territory back from ISIL these are any type of effort to protect them from
[01:47:21.300 --> 01:47:25.660]  Syrian forces would be defensive in nature but I'm not gonna talk about the
[01:47:25.660 --> 01:47:31.060]  legal but I'm sorry but this is a major shift in in policy it's one thing to go
[01:47:31.060 --> 01:47:35.860]  after ISIS it's something else to attack forces that threaten the forces that go
[01:47:35.860 --> 01:47:42.060]  after ISIS do you do you have congressional approval for that are you
[01:47:42.060 --> 01:47:45.220]  are you seeking are you gonna seek congressional approval for that under
[01:47:45.220 --> 01:47:49.700]  what authorization are you doing that we would at whatever steps we took would
[01:47:49.700 --> 01:47:54.100]  be in close consultation with Congress I'm sorry but what do you what what why
[01:47:54.100 --> 01:47:58.860]  do you think you don't need a UN Security Council decision on this was that
[01:47:58.860 --> 01:48:06.340]  why don't we think we need one you don't need we're obviously you know
[01:48:06.340 --> 01:48:11.940]  Syria is a very complex situation I've said this multiple times I want to
[01:48:11.940 --> 01:48:15.420]  talk about this you know when I hear them talking about this as if they need to
[01:48:15.420 --> 01:48:19.980]  get UN Security Council clearance I'm reminded Joe of that back and forth
[01:48:19.980 --> 01:48:23.900]  between Senator Sessions and Leon Panetta when he was Defense Secretary and
[01:48:23.900 --> 01:48:27.460]  Sessions is that saying you know under what conditions can you use military
[01:48:27.460 --> 01:48:31.140]  force and he goes are you know and he's trying to get him to say well we would
[01:48:31.140 --> 01:48:34.380]  go to Congress and we would get a declaration from Congress because
[01:48:34.380 --> 01:48:37.740]  constitutionally that's what's required but of course Panetta didn't say that
[01:48:37.740 --> 01:48:42.220]  you'd say well we will talk to our the people at NATO we'll talk to the United
[01:48:42.220 --> 01:48:45.820]  Nations and Senator Sessions says well what about Congress well we would we
[01:48:45.820 --> 01:48:49.260]  would advise Congress as to what we're doing and he's like I can't believe what
[01:48:49.260 --> 01:48:53.180]  I'm hearing here you're you are a former congressman you know what the
[01:48:53.180 --> 01:48:56.860]  Constitution says you know that you're supposed to get authorization for war
[01:48:56.860 --> 01:49:02.820]  from Congress not from NATO not from the UN and of course now they could really
[01:49:02.820 --> 01:49:05.780]  get careless even about going to those two they're gonna do whatever they wish
[01:49:05.780 --> 01:49:06.460]  at this point.
[01:49:06.460 --> 01:49:09.460]  Syria is gonna get demolished and ISIS will come out on top because there's been
[01:49:09.460 --> 01:49:14.220]  air campaigns going on over Syria supposedly going after ISIS for almost a
[01:49:14.220 --> 01:49:17.380]  year now from multiple different countries and there's been reports that
[01:49:17.380 --> 01:49:23.260]  there's been zero there there has been zero effect on ISIS on their manpower
[01:49:23.260 --> 01:49:27.500]  whatsoever so with all these air campaigns going on to go after ISIS
[01:49:27.500 --> 01:49:31.740]  they've really had no significant drop in manpower on the ground out
[01:49:31.740 --> 01:49:34.380]  there and the only people who are suffering are the people of Syria.
[01:49:34.380 --> 01:49:39.700]  Well exactly as this reporter said it's a different thing to attack ISIS and to
[01:49:39.700 --> 01:49:42.820]  defend ISIS and that's what they're talking about with this policy is
[01:49:42.820 --> 01:49:48.020]  defending ISIS and of course they created ISIS they created ISIS as a tool
[01:49:48.020 --> 01:49:52.340]  to overthrow Syria and they've been trying to go after Syria now ISIS is
[01:49:52.340 --> 01:49:56.540]  spilling over into Iraq and so forth and so on whether they wish that to happen
[01:49:56.540 --> 01:49:59.740]  or whether that's an unintended consequence we don't really know but
[01:49:59.740 --> 01:50:03.820]  it's amazing for me to see this guy talking about how well I don't know
[01:50:03.820 --> 01:50:07.060]  what legal authority he doesn't even address that he says well it's a lawless
[01:50:07.060 --> 01:50:10.260]  area it's kind of like when Al Gore said there's no controlling legal authority
[01:50:10.260 --> 01:50:14.100]  here in the White House and that's true there is no controlling legal authority
[01:50:14.100 --> 01:50:18.500]  in Washington because Washington itself is a lawless area but he says that these
[01:50:18.500 --> 01:50:23.060]  are defensive measures I mean we're there we've created this rebel force
[01:50:23.060 --> 01:50:27.140]  ISIS that's there what what are we defending we're defending ISIS we're
[01:50:27.140 --> 01:50:30.300]  defending ISIS are defensive measures for ISIS we're gonna we're gonna attack
[01:50:30.300 --> 01:50:34.980]  the guys who are going after ISIS like we're supposed to be doing yes I mean
[01:50:34.980 --> 01:50:39.100]  it's crazy that it's in front of the American people and people are so blind
[01:50:39.100 --> 01:50:43.420]  to it and all they care about is a damn line absolutely absolutely we're gonna
[01:50:43.420 --> 01:50:47.060]  be right back with Joe Biggs in the next hour we're gonna be talking to Lionel
[01:50:47.060 --> 01:50:50.700]  and of course the question about pre-crime is one of the things we'll be
[01:50:50.700 --> 01:50:54.060]  bringing up a lot I'll stay with us we're gonna talk about ISIS and what is
[01:50:54.060 --> 01:50:58.100]  happening with ISIS in the United States it's not just in Syria we'll be right
[01:50:58.100 --> 01:50:59.580]  back
[01:50:59.580 --> 01:51:04.100]  communist China freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates while our US

[01:55:41.340 --> 01:55:45.580]  apparently knows more and cares more about the Constitution than anybody in
[01:55:45.580 --> 01:55:49.020]  our government certainly in the Obama administration but you know Joe when we
[01:55:49.020 --> 01:55:54.380]  look at what's gonna be coming up with this debate later this week candidates
[01:55:54.380 --> 01:56:02.820]  like your favorite Lindsey Graham they're gonna be pushing for even more of
[01:56:02.820 --> 01:56:07.100]  this kind of criminal activity just you know go to war with Syria go to war
[01:56:07.100 --> 01:56:10.540]  everywhere that you want to go there they think that Obama is not doing enough
[01:56:10.540 --> 01:56:15.500]  of this him and John McCain are just a trip I'm telling you these guys are
[01:56:15.500 --> 01:56:21.180]  hell bent on just complete and total global war yeah blood thirsty I mean
[01:56:21.180 --> 01:56:25.940]  I've never you know growing up in between South Carolina and Florida my mom was
[01:56:25.940 --> 01:56:32.020]  from South Carolina actually right outside of Belmont where this the three
[01:56:32.020 --> 01:56:37.140]  preppers were arrested by FBI you know for supposedly wanting to go ballistic
[01:56:37.140 --> 01:56:44.260]  about Jade Helm and my grandparents were big contributors you know they paid
[01:56:44.260 --> 01:56:48.220]  into a lot of these different uh campaigns and when I was young my
[01:56:48.220 --> 01:56:53.300]  grandparents like Lindsey Graham and I never understood it is going on I mean
[01:56:53.300 --> 01:56:57.500]  even as a child I was like this guy is demented yeah and now that you I've
[01:56:57.500 --> 01:57:04.020]  gotten older he is just the worst human being well I mean the good news is that
[01:57:04.020 --> 01:57:08.020]  he's now been relegated to the junior varsity debate along with Rick Perry
[01:57:08.020 --> 01:57:13.140]  Rick Santorum Lindsey Graham those guys are going to be in in a junior varsity
[01:57:13.140 --> 01:57:17.940]  debate because their their poll figures are so incredibly low the bad news is
[01:57:17.940 --> 01:57:23.180]  I've got to watch that JV debate I've got to watch like six to eight hours of
[01:57:23.180 --> 01:57:27.380]  Fox News and you're gonna have to put me on a suicide watch oh Thursday
[01:57:27.380 --> 01:57:30.340]  Thursday I'm gonna be watching I actually have a large group of friends here in
[01:57:30.340 --> 01:57:33.660]  the Austin area yeah I'm gonna get together grill some steaks have a few
[01:57:33.660 --> 01:57:39.100]  beers and just watch this and have I don't know I'm kind of interested to see
[01:57:39.100 --> 01:57:42.220]  how Donald Trump's gonna come out because he's a character he's a he's a
[01:57:42.220 --> 01:57:47.740]  funny guy to see if anyone attacks him and see how he comes back it'll be real
[01:57:47.740 --> 01:57:51.500]  interesting and you know he's had and I don't know if it's his policies or if
[01:57:51.500 --> 01:57:54.900]  it's ghost writers who've written the books for him but you know when he's
[01:57:54.900 --> 01:58:00.220]  talked in the past about immigration he's done so in the book at least he
[01:58:00.220 --> 01:58:03.380]  actually had some good points in terms of removing some of the incentives that
[01:58:03.380 --> 01:58:08.020]  are behind the subsidies that are behind the massive open borders of course
[01:58:08.020 --> 01:58:11.660]  he's not gonna talk about how this is an engineered global crisis that's
[01:58:11.660 --> 01:58:13.900]  they're not gonna get to that but it's going to be an interesting debate
[01:58:13.900 --> 01:58:16.380]  building a giant wall is not gonna help either because if you build a wall you
[01:58:16.380 --> 01:58:20.100]  can dig a hole under it that's right and but the giant wall will help to keep us
[01:58:20.100 --> 01:58:24.700]  in yeah exactly it'll help us so they can look for identity papers exactly stay

[02:00:12.900 --> 02:00:20.380]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:20.380 --> 02:00:28.500]  Alex Jones. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight and joining me
[02:00:28.500 --> 02:00:31.940]  now is Joe Biggs I'm gonna keep Joe here for one more segment and then we're
[02:00:31.940 --> 02:00:36.700]  gonna be joined by Lionel and I've got some questions to ask Lionel I want to
[02:00:36.700 --> 02:00:40.580]  get his opinion about what's happening with politics but I think there's also
[02:00:40.580 --> 02:00:45.420]  we've got an article up on info wars.com and this is the question Joe that I
[02:00:45.420 --> 02:00:49.460]  would ask any of these candidates if I was allowed to ask one of them I would
[02:00:49.460 --> 02:00:54.420]  say can the government can the federal government ban anything anything I mean
[02:00:54.420 --> 02:00:58.580]  we had a constitutional amendment to ban alcohol we got another one we had the
[02:00:58.580 --> 02:01:03.500]  18th what was 18 and 21st I think to ban it and then to make it legal again we
[02:01:03.500 --> 02:01:07.460]  had a hundred years ago a Congress that recognized that they did not have the
[02:01:07.460 --> 02:01:11.140]  authority the federal government was not delegated the authority and the 9th
[02:01:11.140 --> 02:01:13.940]  and 10th amendments make it very clear that unless expressly given the
[02:01:13.940 --> 02:01:18.500]  authority they don't have it that's still retained by the people by the states
[02:01:18.500 --> 02:01:22.060]  the states could create alcohol prohibition if they wanted to or they
[02:01:22.060 --> 02:01:26.140]  could like we've seen with Colorado and with Washington state they could say
[02:01:26.140 --> 02:01:31.300]  we're going to decriminalize marijuana and but we've got a Republican
[02:01:31.300 --> 02:01:35.580]  candidate Chris Christie who says that if he's elected president he's gonna shut
[02:01:35.580 --> 02:01:38.460]  that down so the question I would ask these guys is where's your authority to
[02:01:38.460 --> 02:01:42.500]  ban anything including things like cancer drug treatments or supplements like
[02:01:42.500 --> 02:01:46.260]  many of them have tried to ban I just don't get why people would jump on this
[02:01:46.260 --> 02:01:50.100]  whole band marijuana bag and or wagon because you have to understand how many
[02:01:50.100 --> 02:01:54.260]  people out there who smoke pot who normally aren't going to go out and vote
[02:01:54.260 --> 02:01:59.180]  as soon as you do that I mean it seemed like that would be a smart move to make
[02:01:59.180 --> 02:02:03.260]  to go ahead and be all in for legalize it you're gonna get a lot of people's
[02:02:03.260 --> 02:02:06.940]  votes yeah yeah and at the end of the day guess what it's not a bad thing it
[02:02:06.940 --> 02:02:10.100]  helps people out yeah I don't think it really helped Chris Christie do that
[02:02:10.100 --> 02:02:13.660]  because as I pointed out before when he went to the New Jersey racetrack on
[02:02:13.660 --> 02:02:17.500]  Sunday he was routinely booed of course he's not very popular now in New Jersey
[02:02:17.500 --> 02:02:22.300]  I don't think he'd get reelected as governor so maybe he'll fail up but I
[02:02:22.300 --> 02:02:27.580]  don't think so that the junior varsity team now as far as the debate goes I
[02:02:27.580 --> 02:02:30.940]  know he might have made the top 10 but I I'm not sure I'd have to go back and
[02:02:30.940 --> 02:02:34.060]  look at that again oh he did make the top 10 okay so he's on the top 10 but of
[02:02:34.060 --> 02:02:37.660]  course this is something that again is really simply a horse race like this
[02:02:37.660 --> 02:02:40.980]  story I mentioned yesterday just two months ago if we look at the totals
[02:02:40.980 --> 02:02:46.460]  that people had we had Bush Carson Huckabee Rubio Walker all tied at 10%
[02:02:46.460 --> 02:02:49.900]  according to a Quinnipiac poll that was just two months ago and then there was
[02:02:49.900 --> 02:02:55.660]  Rand Paul at 7% but of course he didn't show up they excised that they took him
[02:02:55.660 --> 02:02:59.820]  out and they showed people who got less than Rand Paul which would be crews at
[02:02:59.820 --> 02:03:06.140]  5% Trump at 5% Christie at 4, Fiorina at 2, Kasich at 2 but Rand Paul at 7 it
[02:03:06.140 --> 02:03:10.540]  didn't show up and then we have now over the last couple of months because of the
[02:03:10.540 --> 02:03:15.620]  inflammatory rhetoric that Donald Trump has said also because he speaks truth to
[02:03:15.620 --> 02:03:18.540]  power that's very attractive to people but he's also said it in a very
[02:03:18.540 --> 02:03:23.180]  inflammatory way he's gotten a lot of coverage he's gotten as Rand Paul points
[02:03:23.180 --> 02:03:25.820]  out probably about a billion dollars worth of coverage if we look at the number
[02:03:25.820 --> 02:03:31.420]  of minutes that they have given to people he's gotten virtually all of the
[02:03:31.420 --> 02:03:34.220]  coverage Trump's gonna lead to the whole way and then when it comes time
[02:03:34.220 --> 02:03:37.740]  Bush is gonna be the guy that comes in yeah it's interesting but that's that
[02:03:37.740 --> 02:03:40.380]  should open people's eyes though to show you that the American people are
[02:03:40.380 --> 02:03:45.420]  obviously voting out there and you know going out doing these polls and people
[02:03:45.420 --> 02:03:49.300]  like Trump they like what he says but the establishment doesn't want that they
[02:03:49.300 --> 02:03:53.300]  want someone they can buy out they've already bought up that entire family yes
[02:03:53.300 --> 02:03:57.820]  and they want to get him in yes very true and it's interesting also you know to
[02:03:57.820 --> 02:04:00.780]  look at at Donald Trump I mean he was originally you know when we talk about
[02:04:00.780 --> 02:04:04.820]  him is he a dark horse candidate is he a stalking horse is he there as a
[02:04:04.820 --> 02:04:08.620]  cover for somebody like a Jeb Bush or even Hillary Clinton because before he
[02:04:08.620 --> 02:04:12.620]  started giving money to Republicans he was giving a lot of money to the Clinton
[02:04:12.620 --> 02:04:16.980]  family he also gave money to Ted Cruz about a year ago he was saying that he
[02:04:16.980 --> 02:04:20.860]  didn't think but Ted Cruz was qualified to run for president because of natural
[02:04:20.860 --> 02:04:25.740]  war citizen requirements then he changed his tune he started giving money to Ted
[02:04:25.740 --> 02:04:29.700]  Cruz before he himself started running for presidency and of course the two of
[02:04:29.700 --> 02:04:36.380]  them have met privately they have a very similar stance in terms of saying
[02:04:36.380 --> 02:04:39.500]  things that are going to be offensive to the Washington power structure that's a
[02:04:39.500 --> 02:04:42.980]  lot of the popularity of both of them so be interesting to see how this works
[02:04:42.980 --> 02:04:46.740]  out thank you so much for joining us Joe Biggs stay with us right after the break
[02:04:46.740 --> 02:04:59.060]  we're gonna be talking to Lionel we'll be right back

[02:05:05.100 --> 02:05:09.660]  no one could have seen it coming well this was not true back then and it is
[02:05:09.660 --> 02:05:15.580]  not true today if you were looking for the truth in 2007 the average investor

[02:05:21.460 --> 02:05:26.580]  in particular the last 12 months the IMF and the bank for international
[02:05:26.580 --> 02:05:33.700]  settlements have been issuing warning after warning in July of 2015 the IMF
[02:05:33.700 --> 02:05:39.220]  warned that pension funds could pose a systematic risk in June of this year the

[02:10:32.780 --> 02:10:39.780]  prison industrial complex is now merging into the farm team for indoctrination
[02:10:39.780 --> 02:10:48.500]  and retraining a couple of things first I absolutely positively am against the
[02:10:48.500 --> 02:10:57.140]  notion of spanking hitting anybody for any reason to train to discipline at all
[02:10:57.140 --> 02:11:05.700]  now that being said parents and especially teachers but when a parent
[02:11:05.700 --> 02:11:12.460]  exercises a parental control and believes in good faith that this is in the best
[02:11:12.460 --> 02:11:19.460]  interests of the child and there's no welds or trauma the police should not be
[02:11:19.460 --> 02:11:25.940]  involved in that here's what's going on I want you to imagine and many of the
[02:11:25.940 --> 02:11:31.860]  people listening and watching today who have a child who is special needs
[02:11:31.860 --> 02:11:36.820]  emotionally handicapped emotionally disturbed behavioral and I don't even
[02:11:36.820 --> 02:11:40.860]  want to use these terms because I'm not sure what terms people find
[02:11:40.860 --> 02:11:45.780]  objectionable but I think you know what we're talking about now David I have
[02:11:45.780 --> 02:11:51.380]  been a prosecutor I've been a lawyer most of my adult life I have seen grown
[02:11:51.380 --> 02:11:59.540]  men tough cry like a baby when they're put in the back of a patrol car when they
[02:11:59.540 --> 02:12:07.900]  feel the wrist bracelets of being handcuffed and the fear the lights the
[02:12:07.900 --> 02:12:14.180]  sound it's a it's a sensory overload the the the the whole spectrum is a
[02:12:14.180 --> 02:12:21.540]  grown man imagine you're a child who doesn't necessarily understand things
[02:12:21.540 --> 02:12:28.760]  the way we wish that child would and through the prism of a child sees this
[02:12:28.760 --> 02:12:37.140]  horror and wonders I'm not in trouble this is a note to my parents I'm being
[02:12:37.140 --> 02:12:44.820]  arrested I'm in the back of a patrol car I'm being frog-marched out of my class
[02:12:44.820 --> 02:12:52.660]  subject to the humiliation the shame the indomit the finger pointing I'm put into
[02:12:52.660 --> 02:12:58.060]  the back of a patrol car I'm gonna come back to school and hear the the
[02:12:58.060 --> 02:13:05.660]  chiding and the remarks a jailbird for this is the best part on my column to
[02:13:05.660 --> 02:13:11.580]  my piece say a line on media dot-com I reprinted an article David showing 19
[02:13:11.580 --> 02:13:18.040]  examples of why kids are being arrested burping and belching in class failing to
[02:13:18.040 --> 02:13:26.580]  pick on sir is the crumbs writing on a desk scribbling I love Abby and being
[02:13:26.580 --> 02:13:33.700]  arrested for showing love I can go on and on now if you think that this is
[02:13:33.700 --> 02:13:39.460]  somehow getting tough you know spare the rise for the child if you think that and
[02:13:39.460 --> 02:13:43.660]  you don't see what's happening in the militarization of the police now
[02:13:43.660 --> 02:13:47.580]  bleeding over into the classroom yeah that's the thing that's really
[02:13:47.580 --> 02:13:50.940]  concerning cuz you and I went to school we didn't have we didn't have police in
[02:13:50.940 --> 02:13:54.940]  the schools we had we had spanking in the schools quite frankly one of the
[02:13:54.940 --> 02:13:59.700]  reasons I brought that up was because I thought it was such an amazing
[02:13:59.700 --> 02:14:05.500]  a counterpoint to each other at the same time the UN which is not involved in
[02:14:05.500 --> 02:14:09.340]  America shouldn't be involved America wants to dictate to parents how to do
[02:14:09.340 --> 02:14:14.460]  discipline we turned the police state loose on our children in our schools to
[02:14:14.460 --> 02:14:18.300]  not only do things that are far worse than the spankings that we used to have
[02:14:18.300 --> 02:14:22.140]  from the principles they are tasering children we have a kid down here in
[02:14:22.140 --> 02:14:26.020]  Bastrop they got tasered he wasn't doing anything you see the video footage the
[02:14:26.020 --> 02:14:29.220]  cop walks up to him it was a fight he wasn't even involved in the fight he was
[02:14:29.220 --> 02:14:32.540]  if anything he was trying to stop the people nothing was going on hits him
[02:14:32.540 --> 02:14:36.220]  with a taser the kid falls down hits his head on a concrete floor and now he's
[02:14:36.220 --> 02:14:40.100]  brain damaged for the rest of his life what's going on when they come after
[02:14:40.100 --> 02:14:42.940]  parents and saying we're gonna take your kids away if you spank his or throw you
[02:14:42.940 --> 02:14:48.180]  in jail and yet they they send out these types of people to victimize even
[02:14:48.180 --> 02:14:53.260]  disabled mentally handicapped kids in wheelchairs now remember now David it's
[02:14:53.260 --> 02:14:56.700]  funny you and I have people don't know this you and I share a very interesting
[02:14:56.700 --> 02:15:02.500]  parallel our development I mean where I don't know if you want oh yeah yeah we
[02:15:02.500 --> 02:15:06.500]  both went to we're both grew up in Tampa we went to the same university exactly
[02:15:06.500 --> 02:15:10.780]  very close to the same time yeah probably are I mean it's just amazing I was
[02:15:10.780 --> 02:15:20.700]  thunderstruck but I am a loyal alumnus of the Catholic school system I never
[02:15:20.700 --> 02:15:26.380]  saw a kid get hit once when that nun walked it all four feet tall wearing
[02:15:26.380 --> 02:15:33.220]  full penguin regalia in Tampa Hillsborough County Sun and not breaking a
[02:15:33.220 --> 02:15:41.900]  sweat in black and cardboard you I never heard of a policeman now years later
[02:15:41.900 --> 02:15:45.700]  David you might recall there was something called the school resource
[02:15:45.700 --> 02:15:52.060]  officer or the SRO this was the officer who kind of a big hey David how are you
[02:15:52.060 --> 02:15:56.220]  officer friendly how are you they come on move along boys and it was a slow
[02:15:56.220 --> 02:16:02.540]  introduction of a guy who was just kind of there kind of a well-armed security
[02:16:02.540 --> 02:16:07.660]  guard not really an assistant to the right but there was a police now what
[02:16:07.660 --> 02:16:12.500]  happens is instead of a police of a teacher and by the way we have two
[02:16:12.500 --> 02:16:16.780]  concomitant roles of blame here two vectors of liability the police who
[02:16:16.780 --> 02:16:21.620]  could exercise discretion and say I'm not gonna arrest a kid I'm no I'm not gonna
[02:16:21.620 --> 02:16:29.340]  do this and the teacher but but David they would they're now calling 911 now
[02:16:29.340 --> 02:16:33.500]  what's interesting to notice and you brought this up by the UN to show you
[02:16:33.500 --> 02:16:37.860]  how schizophrenic it is you know this is learn helplessness this is classic learn
[02:16:37.860 --> 02:16:43.460]  helplessness where you are so beaten down you can't predict what to do anymore
[02:16:43.460 --> 02:16:49.260]  the classic of the dog who was a who was given electric shock so many times and
[02:16:49.260 --> 02:16:54.300]  when you open up the pen it just sits there I can't even move anymore but the
[02:16:54.300 --> 02:16:59.620]  UN is telling you either you're being too strict and you shouldn't spank your
[02:16:59.620 --> 02:17:05.420]  kids and we're gonna come after you or it's okay to be excessive and go after
[02:17:05.420 --> 02:17:12.220]  a child and I don't know how this thing works so what we're seeing here is the
[02:17:12.220 --> 02:17:19.260]  systematic habituation and the conditioning of adults and parents to
[02:17:19.260 --> 02:17:26.340]  this thing called authority yeah this absolute heartless mindless learn the
[02:17:26.340 --> 02:17:30.380]  helplessness you know David I want you to go through the these lists of people
[02:17:30.380 --> 02:17:36.260]  and or these these conditions of what kids have been basically arrested for
[02:17:36.260 --> 02:17:42.420]  let me also say this let's assume your child has a scrape with the law so to
[02:17:42.420 --> 02:17:49.100]  speak and let's say your child decides to try to get a job but your child can't
[02:17:49.100 --> 02:17:54.580]  your child can't because your child's got a record got an arrest record his
[02:17:54.580 --> 02:17:57.900]  permanent record going hopefully back to kindergarten that's where they're gonna
[02:17:57.900 --> 02:18:04.060]  start this right so now you're now you're so so you have you have this this
[02:18:04.060 --> 02:18:13.860]  over enforcement of this and again I want to say you know David we have kids
[02:18:13.860 --> 02:18:20.380]  who are being were drowning in in psych meds who are over medicated who have
[02:18:20.380 --> 02:18:26.460]  very serious emotional and behavioral problems I was a juvenile prosecutor
[02:18:26.460 --> 02:18:32.460]  that's not a description of my mental wherewithal but these kids and more
[02:18:32.460 --> 02:18:38.740]  often than not it was my first my first look at how the criminal justice system
[02:18:38.740 --> 02:18:45.740]  handles mental health but you're going to turn a kid over and that kid's gonna
[02:18:45.740 --> 02:18:52.180]  say using Pavlovian conditioning every time I see a cop every time somebody
[02:18:52.180 --> 02:18:57.820]  tells me no I'm gonna remember that I'm gonna remember how they made me feel I'm
[02:18:57.820 --> 02:19:03.220]  gonna remember how they laughed I'm gonna remember how afraid I I remember how
[02:19:03.220 --> 02:19:09.980]  nobody was there to protect me I was the ultimate victim of violation I trusted
[02:19:09.980 --> 02:19:15.260]  my teacher and I don't anymore I trusted the police and I don't anymore I don't
[02:19:15.260 --> 02:19:22.600]  trust authority nobody's here to help me I can't depend on anyone and I'm gonna
[02:19:22.600 --> 02:19:29.980]  give this back somebody's favorite I mean if you can't see where this is going
[02:19:29.980 --> 02:19:34.260]  it's amazing how this has changed over the number of years I mean I remember as
[02:19:34.260 --> 02:19:37.460]  we point out they didn't have police in the schools and you and I were young
[02:19:37.460 --> 02:19:41.940]  even when my my wife was teaching school they still had the system where they
[02:19:41.940 --> 02:19:45.580]  would take somebody away they would punish them in secret and we'll talk
[02:19:45.580 --> 02:19:50.140]  about that when we come back what is behind this training camp for the prison

[02:22:05.180 --> 02:22:08.660]  commercials about wallets that protect you from electronic pick pocket ten years
[02:22:08.660 --> 02:22:11.860]  ago I created a way to protect my own cards from prying eyes after government
[02:22:11.860 --> 02:22:15.260]  officials started talking about issuing a national ID card with a built-in
[02:22:15.260 --> 02:22:19.380]  radio chip called RFID I felt having to broadcast my personal information was an
[02:22:19.380 --> 02:22:23.660]  invasion of privacy soon after it was also announced that credit cards debit
[02:22:23.660 --> 02:22:27.860]  cards us passports hotel room keys and even transit passes would all soon
[02:22:27.860 --> 02:22:32.300]  incorporate RFID it was then I formed ID Stronghold to share my inventions and
[02:22:32.300 --> 02:22:36.140]  blocking RFID signals with the world there are a lot of misconceptions out

[02:24:15.140 --> 02:24:18.700]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight and I'm talking to Lionel
[02:24:18.700 --> 02:24:22.500]  let me award-winning television news decoder as he puts it he's an analyst
[02:24:22.500 --> 02:24:26.500]  he's a commentator of course he is also a licensed trial lawyer former
[02:24:26.500 --> 02:24:30.300]  prosecutor I want to talk to him about an article that's on the New York Times
[02:24:30.300 --> 02:24:35.020]  as well should prison sentences be based on crimes that haven't been committed
[02:24:35.020 --> 02:24:38.620]  yet we'll get to that topic but before we do we've been talking about how
[02:24:38.620 --> 02:24:44.460]  schools have changed how they become training programs for the police the
[02:24:44.460 --> 02:24:51.020]  prison industrial state police at all the schools the over-the-top treatment of
[02:24:51.020 --> 02:24:56.420]  our children at the same time the UN is saying that it wants to see parents
[02:24:56.420 --> 02:25:00.460]  jailed who spanked their children so we're going to go to the extreme against
[02:25:00.460 --> 02:25:06.100]  parents but we're going to allow the most extreme treatment by uniformed
[02:25:06.100 --> 02:25:11.180]  personnel that we can imagine in the schools do you feel that that's what
[02:25:11.180 --> 02:25:15.300]  Lionel just calls schizophrenic I call it cognitively dissonant and by I tell
[02:25:15.300 --> 02:25:19.780]  you I think when I see that kind of radical juxtaposition of these things I
[02:25:19.780 --> 02:25:25.220]  think there's an agenda going on here what about you Lionel well I I I couldn't
[02:25:25.220 --> 02:25:29.780]  agree more first of all I apologize for saying it's schizophrenic with all the
[02:25:29.780 --> 02:25:33.340]  respect and apologies to schizophrenics out there trying to blast him your name
[02:25:33.340 --> 02:25:37.660]  you know David there is a something where I want you to go back and let's do
[02:25:37.660 --> 02:25:41.860]  a thought experiment you and I are part of the ruling class we're at the top of
[02:25:41.860 --> 02:25:47.980]  the pyramid and our division is social I've always said that I told Alex that I
[02:25:47.980 --> 02:25:52.860]  want to be one day the psychologist general not the attorney general but
[02:25:52.860 --> 02:25:58.180]  the psychologist I want to construct means and attitudes and persuasions but
[02:25:58.180 --> 02:26:01.180]  when you and I would do David as we sit down and we say first of all our
[02:26:01.180 --> 02:26:05.340]  assignment is part of this call it whatever you want new world order or a
[02:26:05.340 --> 02:26:11.100]  unipolar world or ruling class is what I call it we're going to destroy family
[02:26:11.100 --> 02:26:15.860]  and people and we're going to make them client and compliant the first thing
[02:26:15.860 --> 02:26:18.740]  we're going to do is we're going to destroy parental autonomy how do we do
[02:26:18.740 --> 02:26:24.300]  that first of all we tell parents that they can't spank that and I'm not
[02:26:24.300 --> 02:26:27.260]  endorsing spanky but doesn't really matter that's not the issue we're going
[02:26:27.260 --> 02:26:30.300]  to tell parents you can't do that we're going to tell parents they cannot have
[02:26:30.300 --> 02:26:36.980]  any say in vaccine or the type of diet or the type of games that your child
[02:26:36.980 --> 02:26:42.060]  plays maybe dodgeball this week we might consider to be a problem we're also one
[02:26:42.060 --> 02:26:47.140]  day going to go after food you're gonna have them I'm vegan by choice but you're
[02:26:47.140 --> 02:26:53.660]  gonna see them going after parents who elect to have their kids raised vegan
[02:26:53.660 --> 02:26:57.100]  not because they care about the diet of a child they just want to exert more
[02:26:57.100 --> 02:27:01.900]  control then it's gonna be circumcision watch when that happens
[02:27:01.900 --> 02:27:06.860]  irrespective of religious anything because you see in our thought
[02:27:06.860 --> 02:27:11.780]  experiment David doesn't matter why we're doing this we want to exact control
[02:27:11.780 --> 02:27:17.980]  and we also want you as a parent to feel that you know they and I love this it
[02:27:17.980 --> 02:27:25.940]  takes a village yes love the idea that yes we in society share a responsibility
[02:27:25.940 --> 02:27:34.980]  to assist to help when need be but we do not enjoy our child being part of the
[02:27:34.980 --> 02:27:39.620]  collective as somebody someone time it takes a village idiot to believe that
[02:27:39.620 --> 02:27:44.540]  or as Melissa Harry Harris Perry said we've got to get over this notion that
[02:27:44.540 --> 02:27:47.580]  there's private ownership of children you know when I heard that one of the
[02:27:47.580 --> 02:27:51.900]  things when I hear that Lionel and we play that clip all the time as a parent
[02:27:51.900 --> 02:27:55.700]  I don't think that I own my children I never thought of it that way it takes
[02:27:55.700 --> 02:27:59.660]  somebody who's running a village to think about ownership of children I
[02:27:59.660 --> 02:28:03.700]  just love my children it's not about that and that's one of the reasons why I
[02:28:03.700 --> 02:28:08.980]  didn't like to see corporal punishment in the schools I'm my wife was a teacher
[02:28:08.980 --> 02:28:12.620]  in elementary school one time she had to escort a child because they had been
[02:28:12.620 --> 02:28:16.180]  just impossible to handle she scored some of the principal's office the
[02:28:16.180 --> 02:28:20.900]  principal spanked the child in front of her the kid wasn't crying by wife was
[02:28:20.900 --> 02:28:25.180]  hysterical a basket case you said I will never do that again and really it's
[02:28:25.180 --> 02:28:29.860]  about having someone disciplining your child who loves them doesn't see them as
[02:28:29.860 --> 02:28:34.140]  owning them and that's another aspect of all this how the government thinks they
[02:28:34.140 --> 02:28:39.260]  own us how they should track us and control us and categorize us and their
[02:28:39.260 --> 02:28:44.220]  permanent record as if we were their inventory their cattle and also you know
[02:28:44.220 --> 02:28:52.260]  as you know people are gonna say well there you go again mr. conspiracy
[02:28:52.260 --> 02:28:59.700]  mr. tinfoil hat always scared about the government coming after you always were
[02:28:59.700 --> 02:29:06.780]  who are these people that want your children who are and what what I remember
[02:29:06.780 --> 02:29:10.380]  going back to our thought experiment in addition to us having this particular
[02:29:10.380 --> 02:29:15.180]  thought vector where we tell people that they have no say we also bring in
[02:29:15.180 --> 02:29:21.980]  people and we applaud them like for example John Stuart who was one of the
[02:29:21.980 --> 02:29:27.220]  most important parts of this this collective who laughed at people who
[02:29:27.220 --> 02:29:32.460]  dared to question jade helm or laughed at people who dared to question so
[02:29:32.460 --> 02:29:39.460]  remember where I hear that and yeah and he was also making a secret visits to
[02:29:39.460 --> 02:29:43.700]  the White House cooperating with Obama on how to sell Obama's agenda let's not
[02:29:43.700 --> 02:29:47.220]  forget that as well when we come back we're gonna be talking to Lionel Lionel
[02:29:47.220 --> 02:29:51.380]  media he's a licensed trial lawyer gonna talk to him about prison sentences based
[02:29:51.380 --> 02:29:56.940]  on crimes that haven't been committed yet and the GCN radio network
[02:29:56.940 --> 02:30:04.900]  and what could only be described as the most mind boggling spin possible
[02:30:04.900 --> 02:30:10.100]  Planned Parenthood is now claiming that it helps prevent abortions in response
[02:30:10.100 --> 02:30:14.220]  to moves by Republicans in Congress to defund the organization which receives
[02:30:14.220 --> 02:30:18.500]  over half a billion dollars per year in taxpayer funds Planned Parenthood
[02:30:18.500 --> 02:30:22.940]  tweeted the following Republicans indignant about abortion are trying to
[02:30:22.940 --> 02:30:29.380]  destroy a government program that helps prevent 345,000 abortions a year to
[02:30:29.380 --> 02:30:33.020]  which one person responded an organization claims it is preventing
[02:30:33.020 --> 02:30:39.260]  abortions while executing almost 400,000 abortions in 2013 and of course this
[02:30:39.260 --> 02:30:43.180]  latest Bush happened when groups and organizations connected to Planned
[02:30:43.180 --> 02:30:48.260]  Parenthood were caught on video chopping up body parts and having individuals say
[02:30:48.260 --> 02:30:52.460]  that they wanted to use the proceeds of said body parts to purchase Lamborghinis

[02:34:50.660 --> 02:34:56.020]  of this we're seeing this move towards pre-crime in so many different areas and
[02:34:56.020 --> 02:35:00.580]  so many different ways I mean we got we had the NDAA a few years ago where
[02:35:00.580 --> 02:35:03.980]  everybody was initially alarmed because there were going to be locking people up
[02:35:03.980 --> 02:35:06.420]  with the military without charging anybody of any crime but now we've got
[02:35:06.420 --> 02:35:11.940]  Wesley Clark floating the trial balloons we've got McCall putting out a violent
[02:35:11.940 --> 02:35:16.220]  extremism bill where they're going to have FEMA camps you know looking the
[02:35:16.220 --> 02:35:20.740]  guy have the fit Department of FEMA under Homeland Security looking at
[02:35:20.740 --> 02:35:24.660]  people trying to sort out who may become a problem in the future now we see this
[02:35:24.660 --> 02:35:27.980]  in Pennsylvania they're going to be the first state in the country to base
[02:35:27.980 --> 02:35:31.460]  criminal sentences not only what crimes people have been convicted of but
[02:35:31.460 --> 02:35:36.900]  whether they're deemed likely to commit additional crimes you know I know you
[02:35:36.900 --> 02:35:41.300]  don't mean to do this but your delivery killed me I was listening to you read a
[02:35:41.300 --> 02:35:45.380]  real story and I'm laughing when the government announced whether you're
[02:35:45.380 --> 02:35:48.740]  going to lock people up before they've committed the crime and you're reading
[02:35:48.740 --> 02:35:57.060]  this and I'm laughing I think this isn't this isn't a joke you know in 2010 I had
[02:35:57.060 --> 02:36:02.660]  talked about this and I believe Alex did as well the Brits he's always looked at
[02:36:02.660 --> 02:36:05.900]  the UK first always look to Europe first that's the better test that's where
[02:36:05.900 --> 02:36:09.820]  they think of these things up that's the last story but they had a system called
[02:36:09.820 --> 02:36:18.700]  crushing criminal criminal reduction criminal reduction criminal reduction
[02:36:18.700 --> 02:36:35.860]  using statistical helper yes they looked at things that were happening based
[02:36:35.860 --> 02:36:43.300]  upon weather and crime to predict where crime was likely to be committed and I
[02:36:43.300 --> 02:36:46.180]  think it makes a lot of sense because if you think well based upon the statistic
[02:36:46.180 --> 02:36:49.580]  for you guys are good I just say something alone we hold there it is
[02:36:49.580 --> 02:36:54.220]  when the piece is highlighted it's amazing your organization anyway it's one
[02:36:54.220 --> 02:36:58.420]  thing to say this particular area precinct five has a high burglary rate
[02:36:58.420 --> 02:37:02.340]  and and New York to do with Comstant and a variety of other things okay that was
[02:37:02.340 --> 02:37:09.980]  terrific now that veered into predicting human behavior now a while back
[02:37:09.980 --> 02:37:17.180]  then I remember this one when sex offenders rapists and the worst of the
[02:37:17.180 --> 02:37:22.060]  worst were given a sentence let's say you're given 25 years to life and a
[02:37:22.060 --> 02:37:29.300]  defendant was sentenced and absolutely did every last day of it and you could
[02:37:29.300 --> 02:37:35.300]  have post-release no probation whatever but they started to say you know there
[02:37:35.300 --> 02:37:39.980]  are people who by virtue of what we've learned and their behavior might continue
[02:37:39.980 --> 02:37:45.540]  to commit rape based upon what they've said I'm gonna rape again or what have
[02:37:45.540 --> 02:37:52.940]  you let's keep them in jail or in prison and I thought wait a minute hold it no
[02:37:52.940 --> 02:37:58.940]  no no no no no you can't do that either charge him again wait I know this is a
[02:37:58.940 --> 02:38:04.580]  tough thing you got to wait until they commit a crime oh you don't understand
[02:38:04.580 --> 02:38:10.820]  no idea this was real isn't you don't understand the recidivism read is up
[02:38:10.820 --> 02:38:14.420]  yes I understand this and by the way you're showing this minority report
[02:38:14.420 --> 02:38:19.540]  every time I watch a TV show I can't believe it TV show a movie I'm watching
[02:38:19.540 --> 02:38:25.660]  either the future or I'm using it as a reference I'm my wife and I watch May
[02:38:25.660 --> 02:38:29.900]  Berry all the time and cry because I'm thinking it really was that way so what
[02:38:29.900 --> 02:38:34.980]  happens and let me just explain this when you train an animal I'm a psych
[02:38:34.980 --> 02:38:39.780]  major I'm an amateur psychologist and a self-appointed TV expert and virtually
[02:38:39.780 --> 02:38:45.540]  an ESA but what happens is you do systematic approximation when you train
[02:38:45.540 --> 02:38:51.260]  your dog or your cat whatever you give him a little bit and a little bit more
[02:38:51.260 --> 02:38:59.100]  and you acclimate you habituate you have this sense where that the stimuli are
[02:38:59.100 --> 02:39:04.580]  not novel anymore so we start off with crush in 2010 we start up with another
[02:39:04.580 --> 02:39:08.140]  story of keeping people in who are rapists you don't mind that do you
[02:39:08.140 --> 02:39:11.860]  America I mean after all you don't want somebody raping your daughter no that's
[02:39:11.860 --> 02:39:15.940]  okay and then we add a little bit more then we go into terrorists and then we
[02:39:15.940 --> 02:39:23.140]  go into bio referencing and then before you know it somebody wakes up and says
[02:39:23.140 --> 02:39:31.300]  wait a minute when did this happen it happened all along the past couple of
[02:39:31.300 --> 02:39:38.020]  years and when we the conspiracy theorists the tin foil hat lunatics warned
[02:39:38.020 --> 02:39:43.740]  you about this you didn't listen you thought this was somebody's you in this
[02:39:43.740 --> 02:39:49.340]  fog of American exceptionalism could not believe that something this draconian
[02:39:49.340 --> 02:39:55.860]  could actually take place yes absolutely amazing and we can go back and we
[02:39:55.860 --> 02:39:59.220]  look at how many nonviolent criminals are that are locked up right now in our
[02:39:59.220 --> 02:40:03.500]  prisons I remember when they started instituting these mandatory minimums
[02:40:03.500 --> 02:40:08.460]  under Ronald Reagan and they were having to let out violent criminals so they
[02:40:08.460 --> 02:40:13.100]  could lock up nonviolent pot users and that was going on for quite some time
[02:40:13.100 --> 02:40:15.620]  I said don't worry don't worry we'll build a lot more prisons than they did
[02:40:15.620 --> 02:40:19.860]  and now they have prisons where they have contracts with the government they
[02:40:19.860 --> 02:40:25.340]  have a guaranteed occupation rate they get prison labor that is heavily
[02:40:25.340 --> 02:40:29.540]  subsidized they have every incentive to keep these people in you're looking at
[02:40:29.540 --> 02:40:32.860]  this from a legal standpoint Lionel I'm looking at it as a former computer
[02:40:32.860 --> 02:40:37.100]  engineer and I know that when they're going to use a model to determine if
[02:40:37.100 --> 02:40:40.660]  somebody's going to remain in prison or whether they're going to send somebody
[02:40:40.660 --> 02:40:45.260]  to prison I'm very frightened by that I mean this is all boils down to well how
[02:40:45.260 --> 02:40:48.860]  good is their model you know we got the garbage in garbage outs everybody talked
[02:40:48.860 --> 02:40:52.780]  about with a computer I'm not impressed when I see a computer printout I know a
[02:40:52.780 --> 02:40:56.060]  lot of people are if you get a computer to pop up an answer then that's it you
[02:40:56.060 --> 02:41:00.500]  know the answer to life is 42 according to deep thought or whatever but I'm not
[02:41:00.500 --> 02:41:04.900]  impressed by that because it all depends on your assumptions in your model how
[02:41:04.900 --> 02:41:08.820]  good is your programming who gets to make those assumptions which corporations
[02:41:08.820 --> 02:41:11.860]  are we going to go with are we going to go with the ones that grease the palms
[02:41:11.860 --> 02:41:15.620]  of the senators the most are the ones that have some kind of a you know a
[02:41:15.620 --> 02:41:19.700]  program that actually works but all of that skirts those pragmatic decisions
[02:41:19.700 --> 02:41:24.020]  that are are really troublesome skirt the whole issue of legality do we want to
[02:41:24.020 --> 02:41:27.180]  have the presumption of innocence before we put somebody out should actually be
[02:41:27.180 --> 02:41:31.980]  convicted of a crime I mean this is insane you know I could I could speak to
[02:41:31.980 --> 02:41:36.700]  you forever whatever you say something you inspire a new thought we have in this
[02:41:36.700 --> 02:41:40.260]  country this crazy idea called probable cause reasonable suspicion and the like
[02:41:40.260 --> 02:41:45.380]  it means simply this if I think if I have and we we had it here in New York I'll
[02:41:45.380 --> 02:41:49.820]  stop questioning Frisk and stop and Frisk and Terry whatever it is let's say you
[02:41:49.820 --> 02:41:54.820]  and I are in a car cop car late at night and we say I see that guy over there
[02:41:54.820 --> 02:41:59.740]  yeah I think he's up to something let's go stop him wait a minute can't do that
[02:41:59.740 --> 02:42:03.940]  we have no reasonable suspicion now probable cause reasonable suspicion
[02:42:03.940 --> 02:42:08.380]  that's what we do in this country please can talk to you we can arrest you we can
[02:42:08.380 --> 02:42:13.300]  convict you how we can even kill you but we have to play by the rules well now
[02:42:13.300 --> 02:42:17.500]  we're getting rid of that here's what happened a while back DUI checkpoints
[02:42:17.500 --> 02:42:22.540]  sounds good didn't it but after all you you know what your daughter to be killed
[02:42:22.540 --> 02:42:28.420]  and they always you know David in that in trial law the quickest way to a to a
[02:42:28.420 --> 02:42:32.900]  mistrial is a violated thing called the golden rule and it means something like
[02:42:32.900 --> 02:42:38.180]  that how would you feel how would you fail if this guy broken here and you can
[02:42:38.180 --> 02:42:43.100]  almost hear it mistrial because you don't talk about objectifying or
[02:42:43.100 --> 02:42:47.380]  translating something into this subjective understanding of the crime
[02:42:47.380 --> 02:42:53.140]  no it's about proof and weighing the proof not how you feel but it started with
[02:42:53.140 --> 02:42:58.500]  DUI checkpoints started with drug testing come forward all you people that
[02:42:58.500 --> 02:43:02.140]  we've never suspected come here mr. Knight have a seat yes would you please
[02:43:02.140 --> 02:43:07.660]  miturate into this Dixie cup why well to disprove something I've never accused
[02:43:07.660 --> 02:43:13.860]  you nor have I ever ever thought you ever violated you've never been to work
[02:43:13.860 --> 02:43:18.420]  late or stoned or whatever by the way all of you in this lane pull over to
[02:43:18.420 --> 02:43:23.500]  disprove that you are not drunk even though there are no indicia indications
[02:43:23.500 --> 02:43:27.180]  evidence that you are it also started with and today you can forget it
[02:43:27.180 --> 02:43:32.460]  immigration checkpoints everybody just be corralled so little by little again
[02:43:32.460 --> 02:43:39.380]  more acclimation more condition more habituation more getting used to this
[02:43:39.380 --> 02:43:45.780]  idea and more of an acceptance that probable cause reasonable suspicion all
[02:43:45.780 --> 02:43:50.380]  of these precursors don't really apply anymore we're gonna cut out the middle
[02:43:50.380 --> 02:43:56.220]  man so that's what we're doing also in this scheme of things and you know it's
[02:43:56.220 --> 02:44:01.140]  one thing when you are a public carrier you're a bus driver and by the way I've
[02:44:01.140 --> 02:44:06.140]  got to say this about drug testing I never understood something which is
[02:44:06.140 --> 02:44:11.820]  normally a urine test that detects whether I've come into contact with
[02:44:11.820 --> 02:44:17.580]  something 30 days ago two weeks ago hell if you're gonna do a test of a guy
[02:44:17.580 --> 02:44:23.100]  driving a bus do a blood test I mean if you're gonna have to so we have
[02:44:23.100 --> 02:44:30.540]  completely eliminated the idea of the police ever having problems by the way
[02:44:30.540 --> 02:44:36.180]  you ever seen this the pick up the phone there's an idea this is a detective
[02:44:36.180 --> 02:44:40.260]  gil hooli we want you to come down to the station all right I'll be there and
[02:44:40.260 --> 02:44:45.220]  people do come down to the station for what what is this an invitation you know
[02:44:45.220 --> 02:44:50.740]  Bobby lunch I don't have to do anything you say here's one for you you most
[02:44:50.740 --> 02:44:55.940]  probably and I'm not versed with Texas law but where I'm from you can lie all
[02:44:55.940 --> 02:45:01.020]  you want to a police officer what's your name son Donald Duck where you're from
[02:45:01.020 --> 02:45:08.140]  ah well that's you know it's the brakes you lie to an FBI agent and that's what
[02:45:08.140 --> 02:45:12.740]  happened to Martha Stewart for me that's happened to Martha Stewart so why
[02:45:12.740 --> 02:45:19.620]  what why can't I lie I have the right to remain silent I'm not under oath and oh
[02:45:19.620 --> 02:45:27.940]  here we go drug dogs this is a better one how many people just believe in drug
[02:45:27.940 --> 02:45:35.580]  dogs they just I mean don't you I mean what do we have next clairvoyance and
[02:45:35.580 --> 02:45:41.340]  psychics no we do that every now and then so of course the line all the drug
[02:45:41.340 --> 02:45:46.740]  dogs don't even talk and so the the officer is free to interpret any
[02:45:46.740 --> 02:45:52.100]  activity of the dog as a positive sign if he so wishes if the dog wags his tail
[02:45:52.100 --> 02:45:57.260]  then oh he finds something in your car that's suspicious so now let's go in and
[02:45:57.260 --> 02:46:00.980]  take a look at it it's just amazing to as you're pointing out the lack of the
[02:46:00.980 --> 02:46:04.940]  presumption of even innocence I mean it started out really used to be that it
[02:46:04.940 --> 02:46:09.100]  was only the IRS we had to prove that you know beyond a shadow of a doubt that
[02:46:09.100 --> 02:46:13.780]  that you were innocent of of doing any of this stuff then we move to the to the
[02:46:13.780 --> 02:46:19.260]  drug situation now we're moving to the war on terror and it just everybody has
[02:46:19.260 --> 02:46:23.700]  been conditioned progressively to accept the fact that we don't have any
[02:46:23.700 --> 02:46:27.060]  presumption of innocence anymore it's absolutely amazing but that's how they
[02:46:27.060 --> 02:46:32.580]  move the Overton window you know let me ask you this you know when I was a
[02:46:32.580 --> 02:46:38.100]  prosecutor that the case well what I learned right away was you know when
[02:46:38.100 --> 02:46:41.820]  you put somebody in prison you know jail is bad enough don't forget prison is
[02:46:41.820 --> 02:46:46.460]  over a year over jail is up to a year but when you put somebody in prison you
[02:46:46.460 --> 02:46:51.140]  better you better hope to God it'll come out worse which they often do but here's
[02:46:51.140 --> 02:46:55.980]  what I would say 90% if I were a judge and I did not have mandatory minimums
[02:46:55.980 --> 02:46:59.980]  or sentencing guidelines or three strikes are out habitual felony offenders
[02:46:59.980 --> 02:47:03.820]  and all those weird statutes nine out of ten people with the exception of really
[02:47:03.820 --> 02:47:07.300]  serious stuff I put them on probation probation is really effective
[02:47:07.300 --> 02:47:13.100]  probation is a pain in the arse at some would say and it allows you to maintain
[02:47:13.100 --> 02:47:19.460]  going to work you know maintaining for your family a lot of times it really the
[02:47:19.460 --> 02:47:25.740]  amount of recidivism probation works like a charm but it's considered to be
[02:47:25.740 --> 02:47:33.100]  weak in this country now the people I do if I were the judge I take you off of
[02:47:33.100 --> 02:47:40.180]  the street not as a punishment you know penal poena from land punishment not
[02:47:40.180 --> 02:47:46.700]  that I take you off the street to protect society you are you cannot
[02:47:46.700 --> 02:47:51.220]  comport it doesn't teach you you know in the old days David there was the idea
[02:47:51.220 --> 02:47:59.140]  of the penitentiary penance you were penitent we was the reform school you
[02:47:59.140 --> 02:48:03.940]  know the penitentiary we wanted to teach you some of the pay your debt to
[02:48:03.940 --> 02:48:10.980]  society you know the idea that you would come go in and come out better that is
[02:48:10.980 --> 02:48:14.860]  ridiculous when the sentencing guidelines came along in the 70s or 80s
[02:48:14.860 --> 02:48:19.300]  the first thing they wrote in many of the state statutes was it is not
[02:48:19.300 --> 02:48:24.940]  rehabilitation is the that is not our goal it's punishment punishment for what
[02:48:24.940 --> 02:48:31.180]  you've done and what happens is you take people and after you let them out they
[02:48:31.180 --> 02:48:36.620]  can't get a job can't get credit they can't do anything you've destroyed them
[02:48:36.620 --> 02:48:40.660]  yes and some do very very well so what you're doing is you're creating this
[02:48:40.660 --> 02:48:45.340]  new class of citizens now we're also getting into this which is even more
[02:48:45.340 --> 02:48:49.140]  frightening David you and I talk about this all the time and I don't want to
[02:48:49.140 --> 02:48:54.900]  sound like some old geezer on the front porch while I was a boy but there was a
[02:48:54.900 --> 02:49:02.100]  time when I remember looking at the police officer as being my friend
[02:49:02.100 --> 02:49:06.940]  Norman Rockwell college what you want the guy in your neighborhood did you ever
[02:49:06.940 --> 02:49:11.900]  have somebody who parked a patrol car down the street hey that's Jimmy
[02:49:11.900 --> 02:49:17.900]  Thompson's dad he's the guy on Sunday who directs traffic after church it was a
[02:49:17.900 --> 02:49:24.420]  community thing the cop wasn't there we go the cop what look at this this poor
[02:49:24.420 --> 02:49:29.780]  kid look at this picture he's running away he's got the knapsack and what is
[02:49:29.780 --> 02:49:33.460]  this cop to it looks like Chris Christie the cop if you look at him he's
[02:49:33.460 --> 02:49:36.740]  looking at the kid and he's saying basically he's talking him over now you
[02:49:36.740 --> 02:49:40.460]  might be a little bit suspicious I hope they call the parent and told them
[02:49:40.460 --> 02:49:44.900]  little Jimmy's okay but this was the idea today he would taser him and put him
[02:49:44.900 --> 02:49:49.780]  in handcuffs he would be drugged up he'd be on something a psychiatric
[02:49:49.780 --> 02:49:57.660]  medication in some juvenile home so and to show you how old I guess I am remember
[02:49:57.660 --> 02:50:05.420]  remember I'm so sorry remember in years ago there was a show SWAT SWAT special
[02:50:05.420 --> 02:50:10.940]  weapons and tactics ABC when it just became new we know what a SWAT team was
[02:50:10.940 --> 02:50:17.100]  and all of a sudden these guys whatever they would get Greg Forest was a name or
[02:50:17.100 --> 02:50:21.420]  something whenever they would have to go to some event they changed out of their
[02:50:21.420 --> 02:50:27.620]  uniform put on their SWAT military stuff with just a black cap maybe an
[02:50:27.620 --> 02:50:35.340]  automatic weapon and then changed back that ain't the way it is that's right
[02:50:35.340 --> 02:50:39.380]  now we have incarceration by algorithm that's going to be the next thing not
[02:50:39.380 --> 02:50:43.260]  only the not the presumption of innocence but incarceration by algorithm we
[02:50:43.260 --> 02:50:47.180]  got one more segment with Lionel Lionel media and I want to talk when we come

[02:54:09.660 --> 02:54:13.460]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight and we're talking to Lionel
[02:54:13.460 --> 02:54:18.660]  of Lionel Media and Emmy award-winning television news decoder legal analysts
[02:54:18.660 --> 02:54:23.580]  we've been talking about pre-crime we've been talking about training our
[02:54:23.580 --> 02:54:28.100]  children to live in a prison society that's what I think that they've turned
[02:54:28.100 --> 02:54:33.060]  the schools into this segment I want to talk to Lionel about his take on the
[02:54:33.060 --> 02:54:37.140]  political race particularly Donald Trump because as it's pointed out in the LA
[02:54:37.140 --> 02:54:41.140]  Times Trump is a candidate everyone can name and everyone has a name for him
[02:54:41.140 --> 02:54:44.700]  there's a lot of reactions on this of course if we looked at the debate that
[02:54:44.700 --> 02:54:51.020]  was on in New Hampshire on Monday night that was the typical kind of snooze
[02:54:51.020 --> 02:54:54.860]  fest that we've become accustomed to it's gonna be far more interesting on
[02:54:54.860 --> 02:54:58.180]  Thursday night because Donald Trump is going to be there and I think it's going
[02:54:58.180 --> 02:55:01.260]  to be an interesting debate remains to be seen if we're going to have anything
[02:55:01.260 --> 02:55:04.700]  of any substance but I think it'll be very entertaining Lionel what do you
[02:55:04.700 --> 02:55:09.020]  think well you know years ago you might remember this one of my favorite shows
[02:55:09.020 --> 02:55:13.540]  on television was SCTV second-city television there was a character named
[02:55:13.540 --> 02:55:16.780]  Vic Hedges who ran for mayor and his motto was Vic Hedges
[02:55:16.780 --> 02:55:22.180]  sure he's crazy but what if he's right that's Donald Trump what if he's right I
[02:55:22.180 --> 02:55:28.180]  by the way every this is this is the gods on his truth every presidential
[02:55:28.180 --> 02:55:32.780]  election race I write in my own name oh and about I'm not voting for any of these
[02:55:32.780 --> 02:55:38.540]  people that being said Donald Trump is fascinating because he's telling the
[02:55:38.540 --> 02:55:42.740]  mainstream media you're not going to determine who's the candidate you're
[02:55:42.740 --> 02:55:48.860]  not going to determine who makes sense who's smart who's viable the people do
[02:55:48.860 --> 02:55:54.420]  and the people like it or not I will always err on the side of the popular
[02:55:54.420 --> 02:55:59.900]  vote say we like him and by the way he has he Bernie Sanders and Rand Paul
[02:55:59.900 --> 02:56:05.380]  but have some of the most cogent and comprehensive views on how to handle
[02:56:05.380 --> 02:56:11.900]  Putin Russia and Ukraine which is a cold war about to go hot so in many
[02:56:11.900 --> 02:56:19.300]  respects Donald Trump is my new hero because the professional left mainstream
[02:56:19.300 --> 02:56:24.980]  media that John Stuart's and others can't believe that their dislike means
[02:56:24.980 --> 02:56:30.740]  nothing yeah absolutely I've seen some things that he's had to say that I agree
[02:56:30.740 --> 02:56:35.500]  with and in print he hasn't really articulated a lot of these yet we he
[02:56:35.500 --> 02:56:39.060]  might be doing that in the debates as we see this come up I guess one of my
[02:56:39.060 --> 02:56:43.180]  questions Lionel about Donald Trump is he's kind of like Picasso you know Picasso
[02:56:43.180 --> 02:56:48.060]  had a blue period followed by a rose period and the same thing with Donald
[02:56:48.060 --> 02:56:51.940]  Trump you know he had a period where he gave a lot more money to the Democrats
[02:56:51.940 --> 02:56:56.380]  he has blue period and then he went into a rose period a red period about five
[02:56:56.380 --> 02:57:00.300]  years ago where he stepped up his contributions and gave almost exclusively
[02:57:00.300 --> 02:57:03.260]  to Republicans so when you go back and you look at political fact they say well
[02:57:03.260 --> 02:57:07.020]  that's not true he's given more money to Republicans they did to Democrats that
[02:57:07.020 --> 02:57:10.740]  is if you average it over 26 years but in the last and that's mainly because the
[02:57:10.740 --> 02:57:14.700]  last five years has really stepped it up David I gotta ask this quick who the hell
[02:57:14.700 --> 02:57:19.140]  is political fact yeah those folks for these people they say I'm a fact okay
[02:57:19.140 --> 02:57:24.020]  well listen prediction quickly Hillary's gonna drop out she ain't gonna be there
[02:57:24.020 --> 02:57:28.380]  she's not gonna be there I don't know if it's gonna be health emails she's not
[02:57:28.380 --> 02:57:32.460]  going to be there once they get the green light Joe Biden is coming to the
[02:57:32.460 --> 02:57:37.180]  fore now because he's already meeting with big Democratic fundraisers big
[02:57:37.180 --> 02:57:44.660]  donors you've got to get rid of Hillary first she's gone I think also Bernie
[02:57:44.660 --> 02:57:49.220]  Sanders is a is the catch basin the little wheel for the Democratic Party
[02:57:49.220 --> 02:57:55.020]  he's forcing him to go left and also Elizabeth Warren who said I am not gonna
[02:57:55.020 --> 02:57:59.780]  run I am not gonna run with Hillary out of the picture watch what she has to say
[02:57:59.780 --> 02:58:06.820]  so that's not but Hillary is post absolute take this to the bank I've
[02:58:06.820 --> 02:58:12.980]  been saying this forever it ain't gonna happen by the way well there we are I
[02:58:12.980 --> 02:58:16.100]  agree I think that there's plenty of people in the Democrat Party is not
[02:58:16.100 --> 02:58:19.460]  just Republicans who want to lock her up they want to lock her out and they will
[02:58:19.460 --> 02:58:23.540]  use all these scandals I mean she's got a lot of stuff on her plate we've been
