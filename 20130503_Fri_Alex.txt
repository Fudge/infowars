[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:33.680]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:33.680 --> 00:38.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this Friday edition of The World
[00:38.560 --> 00:44.280]  By Broadcast. I'm still coming to you from deep in the heart of Arkansas, here in Hot
[00:44.280 --> 00:49.380]  Springs, Arkansas. But I will be back Sunday, for sure. I've extended my stay here. I will
[00:49.380 --> 00:55.200]  be back Sunday in studio there at the M4 War Center in Austin, Texas. And David Knight
[00:55.200 --> 01:03.080]  will be riding shotgun here on the broadcast with us here today, going over a lot of different
[01:03.080 --> 01:11.960]  important news stories and information, obviously. We also have just a ton of really important
[01:11.960 --> 01:19.720]  news just now breaking at Infowars.com. As we told you, in fact, I need to tell the crew,
[01:19.720 --> 01:27.640]  will you guys pull up Rahm Emanuel says put gun owners or having no gun buy list or take
[01:27.640 --> 01:31.760]  guns of people on no fly list. It's about a two minute video. We played it quite a bit
[01:31.760 --> 01:36.840]  over the years. Well, now Democrats are moving to exploit terror watch list in new attack
[01:36.840 --> 01:41.840]  on Second Amendment. It's extrajudicial. They just put you on it. No one knows how you get
[01:41.840 --> 01:45.960]  on it. And then you can't get off it unless you do what they say. We've seen a lot of
[01:45.960 --> 01:51.700]  cases where the FBI goes to highly decorated Marines and people with no criminal records
[01:51.700 --> 01:55.640]  and says, we notice your business is one. We've had these people on as guests where
[01:55.640 --> 02:01.720]  you fly as a salesman. You're on a no fly list until you become an infiltrator for us.
[02:01.720 --> 02:10.800]  Of different groups. It's like Randy Weaver there at Ruby Ridge. They said, you know,
[02:10.800 --> 02:15.800]  you're a former Green Beret. You're going to infiltrate white supremacist groups for
[02:15.800 --> 02:21.320]  us in the area, or we're going to throw your butt in jail. We'll trump something up. And
[02:21.320 --> 02:28.080]  that's how this works in this mafia culture of complete and total fear. And I'm not afraid.
[02:28.080 --> 02:33.360]  All the intimidation, all the threats, all the dirty tricks just confirms how criminal
[02:33.360 --> 02:39.560]  this out of control system is and that it needs to be resisted. And something's happened
[02:39.560 --> 02:43.080]  with the establishment. They have figured out something that's already been going on
[02:43.080 --> 02:49.680]  the last few years and intensifying this broadcast in one way or another. A conservative numbers,
[02:49.680 --> 02:56.200]  15 million people a week. Folks, we've got 10 million viewers conservatively on YouTube
[02:56.200 --> 03:04.480]  a week. The radio is more like 10 million. You add everything together. That's a very
[03:04.480 --> 03:09.800]  low number, an old number to say 15 million. Most weeks now it's about 20, 25 million.
[03:09.800 --> 03:15.720]  Some weeks 30, 40, 50, 60 million people. And it's just spreading and spreading and
[03:15.720 --> 03:19.720]  spreading. And if the government's scared and the globalists are scared and freaked
[03:19.720 --> 03:26.600]  out, I'm not so much scared. I am freaked out because I never knew I would get into
[03:26.600 --> 03:31.040]  this position. I was simply trying to get other people awake and I'd always say I'm
[03:31.040 --> 03:35.000]  looking for leaders to fight the new world order. I'm looking to get citizen journalists
[03:35.000 --> 03:40.640]  to take action. I imaged in my mind millions of people doing little things, bringing down
[03:40.640 --> 03:45.760]  the new world order and that is happening. But this rising tide, I'm the ship on the
[03:45.760 --> 03:51.240]  highest wave. Man, it's like on an elevator in a 100 story building that's just shooting
[03:51.240 --> 03:56.000]  up that feeling in your stomach and the fear in the establishment.
[03:56.000 --> 04:04.560]  The fear in the writers they send to interview me. The people coming up to me on the street,
[04:04.560 --> 04:12.160]  their listeners with their hands shaking to meet me and I'm just a regular guy who analyzed
[04:12.160 --> 04:17.920]  the globalist toned missions. And I tell you, I've got to have a conversation with everybody
[04:17.920 --> 04:27.440]  on air and off air about what do we do now that we are accruing a level of power that
[04:27.440 --> 04:33.240]  actually frightens the establishment. And then how do we deal with all the attacks?
[04:33.240 --> 04:39.360]  Really the desperate flailing attacks. And what does that signify? Well, it signifies
[04:39.360 --> 04:44.000]  that they're just men as well, just like we are. And that when people learn that we can
[04:44.000 --> 04:49.520]  have victory against the globalist, no matter how fancy their teleprompter sets are, these
[04:49.520 --> 04:53.520]  people can and will be brought down. And they know that. They know they're just little men
[04:53.520 --> 05:00.080]  behind the curtain. And they're saying pay no attention and we're saying no, we see you.

[07:03.760 --> 07:10.480]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us 20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012,
[07:10.480 --> 07:14.880]  we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years. You may think out of sight,
[07:14.880 --> 07:20.240]  out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected. The fact is you are. We all are. Food

[08:24.000 --> 08:29.840]  Welcome, my friends, and thank you for joining us for another edition of The Phenomenon Worldwide
[08:29.840 --> 08:36.400]  that is Infowars.com and yours truly as more and more the figurehead of the anti-globalist
[08:36.400 --> 08:44.000]  movement, yours truly, Alex Jones. And his system sees me as a figurehead and the intellectual
[08:44.560 --> 08:50.880]  leading brain trust against the globalist, the mad prophet of the airwaves, as they call me,
[08:50.880 --> 08:57.680]  kind of Howard Beale Network 2.0, and they are coming after us like rats coming out of the
[08:57.680 --> 09:02.640]  woodwork of a burning building. And I am not the one burning down the New World Order.
[09:02.640 --> 09:07.440]  I am simply warning people that the building is on fire and the globalists have drunk their own
[09:07.440 --> 09:12.240]  Kool-Aid. They have drunk deeply of their own Kool-Aid, their own poison propaganda. They're
[09:12.240 --> 09:17.760]  smoking their own dope. They're buying into their own garbage, their own con artistry.
[09:18.640 --> 09:24.240]  And they're thinking that I am discrediting them and I'm making the public hate them
[09:24.240 --> 09:29.760]  in all these big national polls. And that's not what's happening. People don't trust the system
[09:29.760 --> 09:38.080]  anymore. It is very elementary. And it's going to get worse and worse and worse as the inequity
[09:38.080 --> 09:43.840]  intensifies and as justice is flushed down the toilet, and as television and the movies and the
[09:43.840 --> 09:55.040]  culture sells an idea of the police state being ultra sexy and cool and fun. I mean, if you want
[09:55.040 --> 09:59.920]  to know who the New World Order are, what they stand for, look at what they promote, look at what
[09:59.920 --> 10:05.600]  they push in television and in the culture and in the media. It's anti-family, it's anti-truth,
[10:05.600 --> 10:12.160]  it's anti-honesty, it's anti-beauty. They want you to be malfunctioning and psychologically
[10:12.160 --> 10:20.960]  degenerate so that you cannot differentiate good and bad. That's what they want. And they are
[10:20.960 --> 10:27.040]  militarizing the police everywhere. The military quietly for 40 years has been training the police
[10:27.040 --> 10:30.960]  for a military takeover. The police aren't even told that. They're just incrementally
[10:30.960 --> 10:35.120]  taught a military takeover to where you're basically already living under a slow motion
[10:35.120 --> 10:39.760]  martial law and don't even know it. In fact, they're going to do a piece tonight where MSNBC
[10:39.760 --> 10:44.320]  has come out and said, they can dig it up, we can play it. But Knight was telling me about it on the
[10:44.320 --> 10:47.760]  nightly news, it's coming up tonight. Why not play it today? David Knight's riding shotgun,
[10:47.760 --> 10:51.040]  with us here in case I have any technical difficulties, you can pop in. Plus, it's great
[10:51.040 --> 10:55.680]  to have the news guy come in once an hour with a bunch of headlines and banter back and forth.
[10:55.680 --> 11:00.800]  He and Ja'Kari and Rob Dew and so many others have done a great job here and in Full Wars News.
[11:00.800 --> 11:06.640]  But my issue is they've got a mainstream article out today we're going to get to going anti-insurgent
[11:06.640 --> 11:12.240]  tactics taught to the police to be used against the public. But it's to keep you safe from gangs
[11:12.240 --> 11:19.840]  and drugs. Drugs were the excuse to take over China by the West. And they have been used now
[11:19.840 --> 11:27.600]  here. I mean, this is a scientific formulae. This is British imperial technology being deployed by
[11:27.600 --> 11:33.200]  private central banks. And again, it's not the British government doing this, it is that
[11:33.200 --> 11:39.280]  technology that they basically perfected being used now. I mean, here's the thing,
[11:39.280 --> 11:44.000]  here's an example of how the mainstream media operates. They want to say that gun owners,
[11:44.000 --> 11:48.880]  conservatives, libertarians, independent type people are a threat. Anybody that stores food
[11:48.880 --> 11:52.880]  is a threat, because we're people that are self-sufficient. Now, why does that threaten
[11:52.880 --> 11:58.800]  the system? Because they plan on their own words via Gen 21, an incremental design collapse,
[11:59.360 --> 12:03.760]  and then we go into the arms of the central government during that reorganization.
[12:03.760 --> 12:10.160]  There's numbers out today where over 9 million people have gone off of the work roles,
[12:11.040 --> 12:16.400]  the payrolls in the last four years under Obama. And that number is only going to intensify.
[12:16.400 --> 12:20.720]  They go from 25 million people on food stamps to 49 million people, that's double,
[12:20.720 --> 12:24.000]  right at double. And that's not even counting a lot of supplemental stuff, it's more like
[12:24.000 --> 12:30.160]  70 million people on some type of food assistance. Is that a free country? No, that is a country
[12:30.160 --> 12:34.000]  at the grassroots with a private corporate dominant system at the top. But I mean, here's
[12:34.000 --> 12:38.160]  an example of how the news I've got in front of me, literally by the hundreds today. And
[12:38.160 --> 12:41.360]  this is just the news I'm going to be getting into, and then David Knight will bring in more.
[12:43.360 --> 12:48.880]  Appalling irresponsibility, senior scientists attacked Chinese researchers for creating
[12:48.880 --> 12:55.360]  new strains of influenza virus in veterinary laboratory that are hyper-deadly,
[12:55.360 --> 13:00.320]  and can jump across species. Now, that's the London Independent reporting on that.
[13:00.960 --> 13:05.520]  Now, I'm going to have Kurt Nemo post this article, but under it, post the article I had
[13:05.520 --> 13:10.720]  Darren McBreen do last year about deadly bioweapons labs in your neighborhood. And then
[13:10.720 --> 13:17.440]  past articles I did years ago under BioShield, where they've built hundreds of level four
[13:17.440 --> 13:26.560]  bioweapons labs. Even mainstream media said, well, they're called defense, that's how they get
[13:26.560 --> 13:32.320]  around the treaties on bioweapons. But really, they create thousands of gallons of liquid death,
[13:33.120 --> 13:40.720]  was the Boston Globe quote a few years ago. And so I've been harping on this, and even so-called
[13:40.720 --> 13:44.800]  alternative media, who really just feel more powerful if they criticize me and feel like
[13:44.800 --> 13:53.280]  that makes them more successful. Oh, Alex Jones is a fear monger. He says the number one threat
[13:53.280 --> 13:59.680]  to humanity, statistically from his research, is thousands of laboratories worldwide. Thousands
[13:59.680 --> 14:05.520]  of private ones, not just government. Hundreds in the US that are government alone, with stuff like
[14:05.520 --> 14:14.240]  mousepox designed for humans that kills over 90% of the humans that live in the United States.
[14:14.240 --> 14:20.400]  That come in contact with it. If they were to release that, oh, and by the way, it's airborne.
[14:20.400 --> 14:27.520]  Oh, and by the way, they're splicing it with airborne other pathogens and things.
[14:28.240 --> 14:32.720]  And again, whatever you're hearing about is nothing compared to what they've got. And I'm
[14:32.720 --> 14:37.920]  talking about 12 monkeys. Or is it 13 monkeys? What's the name of that Bruce Willis movie?
[14:37.920 --> 14:45.680]  Yeah, 12 monkeys. I'm talking about that type of scenario here. And then you go look at all
[14:45.680 --> 14:49.760]  the globalists, and they all sit around talking about, on record, how there's too many of us and
[14:49.760 --> 14:54.160]  how they dream of, once the police state's in place, they'll have the released bio weapon
[14:54.160 --> 14:59.280]  release. And then this plague will run, and they'll all go to their bunkers and things and
[14:59.280 --> 15:03.680]  have special forces and people protect the nuclear reactors and stuff. And that's what
[15:03.680 --> 15:09.920]  continuity of government is. And this national defense systems are setting up to, quote, protect
[15:10.560 --> 15:16.720]  critical infrastructure is so they can have a release or let a release happen or if a release
[15:16.720 --> 15:21.520]  happens. Because by the way, it's probably going to accidentally happen if it doesn't happen on
[15:21.520 --> 15:26.080]  purpose. People can say, oh, they're not gonna release that. They didn't say that. Okay, let's
[15:26.080 --> 15:31.200]  just say none of that's true, though it is. Gives me a headache drawing up all the sources I have
[15:31.200 --> 15:36.800]  that I've given you at nauseum in films like Endgame and countless articles. But let's just
[15:36.800 --> 15:42.880]  ignore all that. Let's ignore the Moonraker scenario. How long will it take until one of
[15:42.880 --> 15:47.120]  these fission fusion reactors are superconducting super colliders like Hadron where they admit,
[15:47.120 --> 15:51.840]  well, statistically, it could blow up the earth, but, you know, it's a very low probability,
[15:51.840 --> 15:55.360]  but we're gonna do thousands of tests. So actually it's a high probability. People are like,
[15:55.360 --> 15:59.440]  what are you, anti-science? No, I'm not anti-science. It's like, I'm not anti-gun,
[15:59.440 --> 16:02.640]  but I don't think you should give a three year old a gun and not tell them what it is and, you know,
[16:02.640 --> 16:08.400]  let them go to preschool with it. And humans and the people running things, the globalists
[16:08.400 --> 16:16.000]  themselves have a normalcy bias. And of course, the normalcy bias is if you were in Nazi Germany
[16:16.000 --> 16:23.120]  in 1942 and were an SS officer, you were normalized incrementally into thinking lining up men,
[16:23.120 --> 16:27.600]  naked women with babies in their arms. You can see these photos in films. They shot them
[16:27.600 --> 16:33.520]  and just mowing them down. This women with kids is the most horrific stuff I've ever seen because
[16:33.520 --> 16:37.600]  the Nazis were the only ones crazy enough to document it. You know, the communist,
[16:37.600 --> 16:42.480]  all that stuff like that too. And it's just women, like we type into Google, women with
[16:42.480 --> 16:46.400]  babies being shot in Nazi Germany. And it's just all these hundreds of women that look like your
[16:46.400 --> 16:51.600]  mother in a thing with toddlers on there, you know, holding them and then being gunned down.
[16:51.600 --> 16:58.240]  And they thought it was normal. And I've used the normalcy bias example about a thousand times here
[16:58.240 --> 17:06.320]  of the Aztecs. If you teleported back to the Chalupa region of Mexico, right there outside
[17:06.320 --> 17:12.240]  Mexico City, they're in that swampland and where they were doing all the human sacrificing,
[17:12.240 --> 17:15.680]  they're in that growth belt, they're in that agricultural center. And you said,
[17:15.680 --> 17:19.520]  don't kill 10 children every morning to make the sun rise or when it sunsets,
[17:19.520 --> 17:25.520]  the sun is a ball of gas, they would laugh at you because it's a normalcy bias. They're normal,
[17:25.520 --> 17:31.200]  you're not. And see, the acclimators admit, the social engineers admit, they're just acclimating
[17:31.200 --> 17:35.520]  us by degree. And if you could take somebody just like with a poison, like cobra poison,
[17:35.520 --> 17:44.960]  titrating the dose, you can incrementally, slowly sit there and give somebody a tiny bit of cobra
[17:44.960 --> 17:49.600]  poison and a little more, a little more, a little more. And pretty soon after about a year of that,
[17:49.600 --> 17:54.880]  you can give somebody 10, 20, 30 times, depending on the person, they're famous people that would
[17:54.880 --> 17:59.600]  actually let cobras bite them as part of stage shows, to where they could take many times what
[17:59.600 --> 18:05.440]  would kill a horse. And that's the same thing. And I'm here historically going, hey, we're being
[18:05.440 --> 18:11.280]  acclimated. Here they are admitting it. By the way, the elite are crazy. I mean, do they really
[18:11.280 --> 18:18.000]  think they're gonna let some of this bioweapon out and then somehow be safe? The truth is the
[18:18.000 --> 18:21.760]  globalists are in control of everything but themselves. And I've said this a thousand times.
[18:22.640 --> 18:26.960]  But here's that article, appalling irresponsibility, senior scientist
[18:26.960 --> 18:30.480]  attacked Chinese researchers for creating new strains of influenza virus in a veterinary
[18:30.480 --> 18:40.080]  laboratory that is a hybrid and obviously very deadly and mutated. And then here's our article,
[18:40.080 --> 18:45.760]  bio weapons lab in your neighborhood, special report, March 10th, 2012. So over a year ago.
[18:46.960 --> 18:50.560]  And I got there, I'm gonna go out and talk to people and warn them about that.
[18:50.560 --> 18:55.280]  And there are also links under it to some of our previous reports, or it should have,
[18:55.280 --> 19:05.440]  I guess it doesn't, dealing with all that type of stuff. So continuing here, let me
[19:05.440 --> 19:10.720]  break some of this down. I mean, here it is, deadly virus missing from Texas weapons lab.
[19:10.720 --> 19:14.640]  Remember that a few weeks ago back in March? Not last year, but this year.
[19:16.320 --> 19:22.000]  And when you look at that case, people say, well, it's only airborne with rats.
[19:23.360 --> 19:29.600]  But yeah, but rats can also give it to you. And they believe it's mutating to humans. And it's
[19:29.600 --> 19:33.840]  a very dangerous type of hemorrhagic fever. And people tried to spin that and go, oh,
[19:33.840 --> 19:39.120]  it's not dangerous. The point is they're messing with level four stuff at the UT lab that I've
[19:39.120 --> 19:43.600]  already pointed out is probably a prime place to stuff will end up having a breakdown before this
[19:43.600 --> 19:48.640]  even happened. I fingered this lab because it's out on the coast in a level two lab just behind
[19:48.640 --> 19:53.920]  swipe card glass doors when the stuff should be in underground bunkers with fire bombs,
[19:53.920 --> 19:56.960]  where they hit a button if it releases and the whole place burns down.
[19:56.960 --> 20:04.400]  That's what a level four is supposed to have. We'll be right back.
[20:04.400 --> 20:08.320]  In the US one in every 50 homes will have a break in this year.
[20:09.520 --> 20:17.440]  burglars call it smash and grab. Police call it robbery. We call it avoidable. We are fake TV,
[20:17.440 --> 20:21.760]  a simple electronic device that can fool even professional burglars.
[20:21.760 --> 20:27.120]  fake TV easily plugs into any outlet and simulates the changing colors of a television
[20:27.120 --> 20:30.880]  to a burglar. It looks like someone must be home watching TV,
[20:30.880 --> 20:38.320]  so they'll likely move on to an easier target. At only 2995 fake TV costs less than a month of most

[25:22.960 --> 25:27.840]  democrats move to exploit terror watch list in new attack on the second amendment
[25:28.720 --> 25:33.440]  back when obama said a few weeks ago he goes i'll use executive orders and things to get your guns
[25:33.440 --> 25:38.880]  he told nbc that last night that's up on info awards.com as well i told you this would be the
[25:38.880 --> 25:43.440]  attack pattern and again i don't want credit but we're always being attacked that we're not accurate
[25:43.440 --> 25:48.720]  so kurt nemo wrote an article about this a great article an important article that everybody needs
[25:48.720 --> 25:52.960]  to get out to everyone they know i'm going to tweet it out right now to real alex jones but
[25:52.960 --> 25:56.640]  that kurt did not point out that we've warned people about at least i read most the article
[25:56.640 --> 26:02.240]  here this morning and yeah because because we don't do that in fact my writers tend to be less
[26:02.240 --> 26:06.800]  sensational than reality ish and i'm always telling them hey this is worse than what you
[26:06.800 --> 26:12.320]  gave this headline well we just want to try to you know uh you know not not be seen as you know
[26:12.320 --> 26:17.600]  you know being too extreme too extreme they're on msnbc we have a video clip up there saying
[26:17.600 --> 26:23.440]  let's take the guns of people that are on a no fly list or a watch list folks you can put anybody
[26:23.440 --> 26:28.000]  on one of these lists this is the essence of authoritarianism is just say we're taking you
[26:28.000 --> 26:33.600]  away for questioning well that'll never happen that's crazy not in america and i've been telling
[26:33.600 --> 26:39.520]  you for five years this was their plan because a manual at a brady center speech
[26:41.200 --> 26:46.800]  said we're going to get the guns with this if we think maybe think you're a possible terrorist
[26:46.800 --> 26:51.120]  not you're even under suspicion but maybe we think you're connected to a terrorist they can
[26:51.120 --> 26:56.720]  disappear anybody they want including the dorm chumps of the other patsies because they obviously
[26:56.720 --> 27:02.080]  knew too much because these these young men especially the little brother had of the boston
[27:02.080 --> 27:07.760]  bombing had been hanging around with him hanging around on his thing going partying funded by the
[27:07.760 --> 27:14.080]  cia to go to daugustan but let's just ignore all of that having failed miserably to reduce the
[27:14.080 --> 27:20.000]  second amendment to an endangered species the gun grabbers are busily working on a new angle making
[27:20.000 --> 27:27.360]  sure americans on government terror watch lists cannot purchase firearms following the failure of
[27:27.360 --> 27:35.520]  the mansion to me in the bill in the senate to attack the second amendment the anti-second
[27:35.520 --> 27:40.960]  amendment activist and new york democrat representative carolyn maloney have led the
[27:40.960 --> 27:46.800]  charge appearing on msnbc in the week maloney claimed gun laws would have prevented the boston
[27:46.800 --> 27:52.400]  terror attack despite the fact that explosives were used in the attack and then they go on to
[27:52.400 --> 27:58.400]  say that we need to have people that are on a terror watch list not be able to get a gun
[27:59.280 --> 28:05.760]  as it stands now tammerlin as we know now know was on the terror watch list so we know a gun
[28:05.760 --> 28:10.480]  check would have stopped him if there was a background check she said maloney went on to
[28:10.480 --> 28:16.320]  say that gun shows are used by terrorists to buy firearms with no questions asked and they are
[28:16.320 --> 28:20.480]  promoting and say they're going to introduce legislation i saw him saying this weeks ago
[28:20.480 --> 28:26.320]  they're now on tv saying it to put people on terror watch list and show our other media
[28:26.320 --> 28:30.720]  outlets so they just put you on a list or put you on a mental list that's what they've also been
[28:30.720 --> 28:35.360]  calling for is just we're just going to put you on a list saying we think you're mentally ill
[28:35.360 --> 28:41.200]  because the psychologist uh you know talk to you no judge no jury and now you can't own guns just
[28:41.200 --> 28:46.080]  like the soviet union did here's a clip of emmanuel five years ago at the brady center
[28:46.080 --> 28:50.640]  five years ago at the brady center calling for this and i think the most simple thing we can do
[28:50.640 --> 28:54.960]  and we've got to make this a number one issue as a test vote and then take it into the election
[28:55.760 --> 29:01.840]  that is if you are on the no-fly list because you are known as maybe a possible terrorist you
[29:01.840 --> 29:16.960]  cannot buy a handgun in america and i am not one far from liking the mixing of politics and policy
[29:16.960 --> 29:22.160]  but as my old boss used to say give me that vote and throw me into that briar patch i'll make
[29:22.160 --> 29:27.920]  politics out of that every day because if it's between that terrorist terrorist list and the nra
[29:27.920 --> 29:32.560]  i know where america is going to be every time they're going to make the right choice
[29:32.560 --> 29:40.960]  and so the you know the the conversion has always been al-qaeda's the threat give up your rights
[29:40.960 --> 29:45.280]  because of them and then oh by the way now gun owners libertarians returning veterans you are
[29:45.280 --> 29:51.760]  the number one terrorist and that's why the military is awake we're on the march the empire's

[33:22.720 --> 33:29.920]  the reason the establishment hates our guts is we simply go watch the brady center and the cfr
[33:29.920 --> 33:35.840]  and the bilderberg group and the devos events we actually watch them and then come back and report
[33:35.840 --> 33:39.680]  what they say they're going to do and what they've done in other countries that they've already got
[33:39.680 --> 33:44.480]  deeper down their rat hole and i mean the globalists when they fully get control of a country
[33:44.480 --> 33:51.280]  they'll put fascist or communist in and just start killing everybody because they're eugenicist and
[33:51.280 --> 33:54.560]  so people say well you know you'll never stop them well you know what i'm going to slow them
[33:54.560 --> 34:00.400]  down as much as i can and we have slowed them down a lot and they're getting very scared look
[34:00.400 --> 34:05.840]  they've known that we've been reaching let's be conservative you know 10 years ago 5 million
[34:05.840 --> 34:13.920]  people a week five years ago 10 million people a week a couple years ago 15 million people a week
[34:13.920 --> 34:19.280]  the numbers are now 20 25 million a week and a lot of them are new people and it's global too
[34:19.280 --> 34:25.280]  you know i i don't care about making money off somebody i need money as simple fuel like
[34:25.280 --> 34:30.720]  energon cubes you know to to fund our operation but i don't bow down to it i don't know am i
[34:30.720 --> 34:36.000]  bullying i people people go why don't you wear a wedding ring because i don't like how it looks
[34:36.000 --> 34:40.000]  and i don't like how it feels and i i guess i should why don't i wear and people have had
[34:40.000 --> 34:44.320]  family give me nice watches and i wear it for like a week and then just can't wear it anymore
[34:44.320 --> 34:50.640]  because it's not who i am i i need to wear sports jackets i i need to land at events and helicopters
[34:50.640 --> 34:56.320]  i need because that's what would actually wake up the sheeple if i you know charge 500 to come
[34:56.320 --> 35:00.000]  hear me speak which i could do and then bought a private jet like glenn beck i mean i'm not
[35:00.000 --> 35:04.880]  knocking for doing that it's just that i i just it seems obscene so i don't do it but then i'm
[35:04.880 --> 35:11.760]  like wait make all that money and really go after the new world order but it's just again what i'm
[35:11.760 --> 35:16.480]  getting at here is i really want justice and truth and i don't claim to have all the answers but we
[35:16.480 --> 35:23.680]  have shook up the establishment i mean let's not exaggerate 15 20 articles today vicious stuff
[35:23.680 --> 35:29.200]  going on they've got investigators trying to dig through everything i do they've got government
[35:29.200 --> 35:36.880]  people harassing us i don't even get into it on air but dirty tricks paranoia campaigns it doesn't
[35:36.880 --> 35:42.000]  work on me because i already know you're criminals it's not like oh you scare me now you're
[35:42.000 --> 35:49.520]  threatening me oh my gosh i better shut up i mean i've been doing this 18 years and when you act
[35:49.520 --> 35:54.640]  like criminals and do all this stuff to us behind the scenes it only reaffirms what's happening and
[35:54.640 --> 36:00.160]  i was telling a esquire big reporter i didn't realize i i saw a few of his articles that were
[36:00.160 --> 36:05.280]  somewhat nice to ron paul and others and i didn't realize that he did the definitive charlton heston
[36:05.280 --> 36:10.320]  interview before he died he did i mean i'm not exaggerating it's like a hundred he's interviews
[36:10.320 --> 36:16.160]  everybody this is john richardson whose dad was a famous cia guy that carried out the assassination
[36:16.160 --> 36:21.680]  of the south vietnamese president all this stuff and guys comes off as real nice but it's it's
[36:21.680 --> 36:28.320]  creepville uh definitely to have this guy around uh and um he's there trying to convince me that
[36:28.320 --> 36:34.640]  the new world order you know isn't really bad and all the rest of this stuff and he wrote my father
[36:34.640 --> 36:42.240]  the spy about his dad a famous cia you know director of stuff in vietnam of covert operations
[36:42.240 --> 36:47.520]  and a bunch of things and um he's been interviewed by sy hirsch and the whole nine yards but you're
[36:47.520 --> 36:51.440]  sitting there talking to this guy and i'm telling him i'm like well you know my wife has gotten
[36:51.440 --> 36:55.200]  calls while they're listening to her talk to somebody and they call and say by the way we're
[36:55.200 --> 36:59.680]  listening to you just heard that we're the government and he just couldn't even believe it
[36:59.680 --> 37:03.200]  and i'm like come on come on you you know you've done all these interviews you've been around
[37:03.200 --> 37:07.680]  and he goes well i've gotten stuff when i did stuff on the Scientologist you know i've gotten
[37:07.680 --> 37:11.440]  calls like women calling up trying to act like they're my girlfriend i go yeah we've got those
[37:11.440 --> 37:15.200]  two no this is a whole nother level where people are calling your kids up and stuff
[37:16.080 --> 37:22.000]  and you know it's just there's it's like dark dark side light side because you know he said
[37:22.000 --> 37:28.160]  his dad felt bad about killing his friend uh the south vietnamese president he was against killing
[37:28.160 --> 37:33.280]  him but the cia you know boss has told him he had to help carry it out so you know my dad didn't
[37:33.280 --> 37:38.720]  like the torture and stuff that was going on so so the new world war doesn't like it today i mean
[37:38.720 --> 37:45.600]  this is like you know in the early 1960s this stuff is going on and it's just this naivete
[37:46.160 --> 37:51.280]  of even insiders are like well globalism is to redistribute and help the poor no it's not
[37:51.920 --> 37:56.240]  it's to get rid of any uppity people who aren't part of the establishment and create a new dark
[37:56.240 --> 38:00.720]  age that's what they plan and i want to get into a bunch of other news next hour i'll take your
[38:00.720 --> 38:08.720]  calls john bound has gotten the man that shot the video and it's up at info wars.com man drinking
[38:08.720 --> 38:17.120]  iced tea and parking lot gets arrested and we've now had the fayetteville police just called us
[38:17.680 --> 38:22.880]  about our article to explain that that was a state liquor enforcement agent and not them
[38:22.880 --> 38:28.960]  not them so well the local news reported it was the fayetteville police but we will we will look
[38:28.960 --> 38:34.640]  into it and and add that update it's not really a correction to the article but imagine if somebody
[38:34.640 --> 38:38.640]  just shows up and says up against the car going to jail and the guy's like this is an iced tea man
[38:40.640 --> 38:44.160]  it won't matter he'll go to jail the jury will probably give the guy life in prison
[38:44.160 --> 38:49.840]  or something for an iced tea i mean this is the type of stuff i'm talking about it's just crazy
[38:49.840 --> 38:55.760]  but the austin police said you can't hand out your magazine in austin anywhere and i go where's
[38:55.760 --> 39:00.480]  the law well the code enforcers say it's right-of-way advertising i go and i went and
[39:00.480 --> 39:06.960]  looked up that law and i went that's a billboard law bud and they go i know and i listen to your
[39:06.960 --> 39:12.000]  show and i don't like doing this but i'm gonna get in big trouble i said well you better say no
[39:13.360 --> 39:19.120]  and they didn't say no they wrote the tickets i mean what a country and then they backed off
[39:19.120 --> 39:23.920]  the tickets and said well just disregard those now and yeah you're right hey i talked about
[39:23.920 --> 39:28.960]  this yesterday it's the compartmentalization of if i can't hand out magazines in america cops
[39:28.960 --> 39:35.600]  you don't have a future either if you can't walk out of a store drinking an iced tea guy walks out
[39:35.600 --> 39:42.320]  pops it and gas in his car up cop comes over liquor cop and says you're drinking and the guy
[39:42.320 --> 39:46.480]  goes man this is an iced tea don't and the guy's looking at him like he's crazy because that iced
[39:46.480 --> 39:51.520]  tea that he talks about is well known it's sold everywhere we've got the listing of it arizona tea
[39:52.480 --> 40:00.160]  arnold palmer yeah iced tea and lemonade yes arnold palmer arizona teas and they arrest him
[40:00.160 --> 40:05.600]  and let me tell you they'll send him to jail i mean i've seen juries send people to jail for
[40:05.600 --> 40:12.720]  pocket constitutions because it's about worshiping the out of control authority and if you worship
[40:12.720 --> 40:18.480]  at that dark altar folks you have no future so shifting gears i want to go to david knight and
[40:18.480 --> 40:23.200]  get his take on what i was just mentioning but but before we do that uh david do we have the
[40:23.200 --> 40:28.880]  new magazine in there in studios for tv viewers can see it yes we do the the the the may issue
[40:30.240 --> 40:37.280]  the may issue is out and it will sell out quickly there's only 110 or 20 i forget how many they
[40:37.280 --> 40:42.880]  printed no it's over 100 000 copies it will sell out it is at cost in groups of 10 up to 100
[40:42.880 --> 40:49.440]  three bumper stickers per magazine we're going to put 20 000 in san antonio and 60 000 they're now
[40:49.440 --> 40:54.000]  going the streets today in austin get them and put them on your own property and give them people
[40:54.000 --> 40:58.800]  that want to put them on their property this is going to explode across the country this is going
[40:58.800 --> 41:03.360]  to explode most of them will go in central texas but the 20 or 30 000 we usually sell to everybody
[41:03.360 --> 41:07.520]  here that go out and subscriptions you can put them up in your area another devastating victory
[41:07.520 --> 41:12.240]  and this is successful i may start doing it every few months if i get the money to do it it costs
[41:12.240 --> 41:17.760]  about forty thousand dollars total to have them printed and put in and everything uh and we'll
[41:17.760 --> 41:23.280]  put millions of them across america info wars.com save the constitution the others info wars.com at
[41:23.280 --> 41:27.360]  least that's what i told them to do is that what it says david i'm not back to see it yet yeah it's
[41:27.360 --> 41:32.400]  uh this is the history of false flags and it's a great issue they've even got on the cover here
[41:32.400 --> 41:40.080]  they've got a jogger um with 666 boylston street on his chest which is uh you know where the finish
[41:40.080 --> 41:44.400]  line for the boston marathon and a skull face yeah yeah that's right yeah and inside we've got
[41:44.400 --> 41:50.880]  a uh we've got um a lot of information about the history of false flags and that's really key
[41:50.880 --> 41:54.800]  because people have to understand and get the message out to people exactly what a false flag
[41:54.800 --> 41:58.320]  is that that word started trending after dan brought it up at the press conference
[41:58.320 --> 42:03.600]  but people have to understand how the government has done this over and over again and we've got
[42:03.600 --> 42:08.560]  to stop that tool we got to take that tool out of their toolkit the way they manipulate people and
[42:08.560 --> 42:12.400]  you know that could save lives if we could stop this kind of uh attack that we see over and over
[42:12.400 --> 42:16.080]  again and then it's got a lot of uh bumper stickers in here we got three bumper stickers
[42:16.080 --> 42:20.160]  that are in here absolutely in fact i just pulled it up on info war store.com and it's a double
[42:20.160 --> 42:27.360]  cover uh one cover has the american flag um being painted on the front and on the back is another
[42:27.360 --> 42:32.080]  cover i'm sorry somebody just popped in my ear what did you say yeah here we are yeah this is
[42:32.080 --> 42:38.080]  the back okay great fantastic and then so it's a it's a special issue double cover three free bumper
[42:38.080 --> 42:42.640]  stickers i mean these aren't like a little paper stickers these are high quality you know uh
[42:42.640 --> 42:49.840]  petroleum-based stickers that last for years uh and conservatively these will be seen thousands
[42:49.840 --> 42:54.320]  of times apiece some estimates are 20,000 times in a major metropolitan city like new york
[42:54.320 --> 42:59.280]  and in a year uh or in their life and so we're talking about tens of millions of people seeing
[42:59.280 --> 43:05.440]  info wars.com one says save the constitution uh info wars.com the other says info wars.com the
[43:05.440 --> 43:11.040]  other says prison planet.com hit them and hit them hard ladies and gentlemen uh this is the new
[43:11.040 --> 43:15.680]  edition of the magazine we actually lose money on this with the bumper stickers big time i don't
[43:15.680 --> 43:20.720]  care it's an info war weapon and that's why you need to buy at the seed center we've got the

[44:24.000 --> 44:28.080]  we're in texas that has a lot lower living uh cost so that's how we're able to do it
[44:28.080 --> 44:33.680]  that's but but the point is buy books videos t-shirts they all get the word out they all
[44:33.680 --> 44:38.080]  educate you to a higher level they all wake others up you can pay it forward and pass it on
[44:38.080 --> 44:48.320]  buy from the good guys info war store.com or 888-253-3139 888-253-3139 but if you live in

[44:54.480 --> 44:59.040]  regular sheeple to be the only ones that pick this up and do nothing with the stickers i want this to
[44:59.040 --> 45:03.920]  be a special issue where you go pick up 10 or 15 and give them to friends and family their listeners
[45:03.920 --> 45:09.760]  show that most of the stickers get put up and it will absolutely light up central texas next time
[45:09.760 --> 45:14.080]  i'll probably have it where i buy like a hundred thousand extra magazines that are just for sale
[45:14.080 --> 45:17.920]  to listeners at cost and then put them out on the streets of austin that don't have the bumper
[45:17.920 --> 45:21.920]  stickers because it costs so much and then you know just send them out to listeners that have
[45:21.920 --> 45:27.280]  bumper stickers but we're doing this it's a very aggressive operation info war store.com and please
[45:27.280 --> 45:31.680]  don't forget to support our local am and fm affiliates by supporting their local sponsors
[45:31.680 --> 45:36.000]  or becoming a sponsor as well we're gaining a lot of new affiliates but it's important to
[45:36.000 --> 45:41.760]  spread the word about the show and to become a sponsor of the local affiliate as well now going
[45:41.760 --> 45:46.480]  back to david knight david i mean i've known this i've had this understanding many times but it
[45:46.480 --> 45:50.720]  really hit me like a ton of bricks this morning they are so scared of what happened with dan
[45:50.720 --> 45:56.400]  bedandi because if citizen journalists start their own website or work for a new site like
[45:56.400 --> 46:01.920]  info wars.com or or work for a local radio station a lot of stations are begging for help you can go
[46:01.920 --> 46:06.320]  and say hey i'd like to be a reporter for you uh you know look at my youtube channel where i've
[46:06.320 --> 46:10.560]  done my own reporting show you're a reporter that's how this starts i went and got an access
[46:10.560 --> 46:15.280]  show six months later had a weekend show six months later had a weekday show six months later
[46:15.280 --> 46:19.760]  had a syndicated show just because i did it so much of it's getting in the arena taking those
[46:19.760 --> 46:24.480]  first steps that's how the journey with thousand mile starts the old chinese proverb with a single
[46:24.480 --> 46:29.040]  step do your youtube channel show you can do news even if you're not really good at it you'll get
[46:29.040 --> 46:34.240]  better then go say i want to be a local uh a reporter for you i'll sweep up i'll do whatever
[46:34.240 --> 46:39.120]  you need and if you have action and don't just sit around like a normal intern going my parents are
[46:39.120 --> 46:44.720]  paying for my uh paying for my college education and i'm an intern here the internships to watch
[46:44.720 --> 46:49.920]  and see if there's anybody with a brain out there intern for liberty go work at a station a new
[46:49.920 --> 46:55.040]  whatever then suddenly go ask real questions at a news conference and you'll be all over the
[46:55.040 --> 46:59.760]  national news they're so scared that's why they're even they said because of drudge report they don't
[46:59.760 --> 47:05.840]  do many drug uh press conferences anymore the white house and because of drudge report they
[47:05.840 --> 47:11.280]  don't let even deputy secretaries of states and people talk because they'll be honest yeah we're
[47:11.280 --> 47:16.000]  going to bring in communism and take your guns people are like whoa really you are yeah i love
[47:16.000 --> 47:21.280]  mal say tongue we're going to create a communist america whoa you know don't talk anymore they go
[47:21.280 --> 47:26.960]  look at a kook jones and drudge and scum you know they're covering uh news stuff and nothing worse
[47:26.960 --> 47:32.720]  than them they are so scared of this ladies and gentlemen and that's what's happening and and if
[47:32.720 --> 47:36.880]  we can get i mean it's just hard to hire reporters and get them trained even though they're great
[47:36.880 --> 47:43.760]  people david nyjakari jackson have just excelled uh darren mcbrane rob jacobson um uh marcos
[47:43.760 --> 47:52.000]  morales uh don salazar kurt nemo uh and just uh lianne mackadoo all the other great reporters
[47:52.000 --> 47:57.760]  everybody there everybody there rob do is kicking butt we need five or six more people we need the
[47:57.760 --> 48:01.760]  money to get them hired i'm not asking for money right now my point is i'm telling you my plan but
[48:01.760 --> 48:06.080]  the big thing is we need to have maybe videos demonstrating how to do it because if you can
[48:06.080 --> 48:09.840]  send him a donnie and go you were running a drill and then they freak out everybody looks at the
[48:09.840 --> 48:15.440]  drill and then now most of america that i talked to goes oh yeah they did it even this esquire guy
[48:15.440 --> 48:20.720]  said i think it's very fishy i think it's very strange you know yeah all this stuff and how and
[48:20.720 --> 48:26.480]  what went on in their cia connections america is waking up and that's what's scaring them and if
[48:26.480 --> 48:33.280]  the real media if the alternative media just keeps pushing it's over folks it's over and and that's
[48:33.280 --> 48:37.520]  what why do you think they're so scared of a state of night well i i guess the question that
[48:37.520 --> 48:41.680]  i have when we look at this pushback is why wouldn't any of the other reporters ask the
[48:41.680 --> 48:46.640]  questions that dan badandi did i mean wouldn't you want to know what's going on if the government is
[48:46.640 --> 48:51.920]  changing their story or if we've got eyewitness reports that say there's a bomb drill going on
[48:51.920 --> 48:55.680]  if we've got the police chief saying they were paying special attention to the finish line
[48:56.960 --> 49:02.320]  why wouldn't you ask them what that's about and yet what we see is after dan asked that question
[49:02.320 --> 49:07.120]  and the guy said uh next question move on uh one of the press conferences it was when the fbi
[49:07.120 --> 49:13.760]  came out and gave their pictures of the suspects that they had the two brothers there was about two
[49:13.760 --> 49:20.400]  questions later there was a guy behind dan and he said don't questions like this that don't don't
[49:20.400 --> 49:25.040]  questions that question what you're telling people doesn't that hurt your investigation
[49:25.040 --> 49:29.520]  i mean it was a softball question that he's asking this fbi director and the fbi director says no no
[49:29.520 --> 49:34.960]  no no no their agents look look look they know without even being told their operatives if they
[49:34.960 --> 49:40.560]  grovel and help they get the inside info they get to you know the helicopter rides they're there
[49:40.560 --> 49:46.160]  blocking they have a bad term for it you know blocking somebody but they're in there blocking
[49:46.160 --> 49:51.680]  and jamming and none of the media came over to dan except a few mainstream said no we agree with you
[49:51.680 --> 49:55.680]  but we're not allowed to report on it in fact a few national people came over that he knew and
[49:55.680 --> 50:00.320]  said you're absolutely right you got a lot of courage kid but the point is there's an example
[50:00.320 --> 50:04.960]  of how controlled the prostitutes are because there was a drill it came out of the boston globe there
[50:04.960 --> 50:11.440]  was a drill and we're demonized as crazy loons who say that you know that obama did it all i know is
[50:11.440 --> 50:16.240]  those guys were protected exactly we're simply yelling there's a man behind the curtain and
[50:16.240 --> 50:21.200]  we're reaching that tipping point and the power structure thinks they can just demonize us and or
[50:21.200 --> 50:25.840]  say we're crazy and it's going to go away they have no credibility i was telling the esquire guy
[50:25.840 --> 50:30.080]  that today i said of course he's a you know more of a slick rider he said look you know he's
[50:30.080 --> 50:33.680]  tried to tell the truth or do a good story so he keeps getting all the big interviews he doesn't
[50:33.680 --> 50:38.160]  just do hit pieces but i said if you attack me that makes me stronger because the mainstream
[50:38.160 --> 50:42.480]  media is so discredited david knight we're going to come back and get into a host of articles you've
[50:42.480 --> 50:46.480]  got there news you think is important you want to cover here on air they want to start the second

[54:19.040 --> 54:24.000]  could be involved and i'm like the government's been caught over and over again the main gulf of
[54:24.000 --> 54:30.800]  Tonkin you know so many examples of this you know other governments have done it you know police get
[54:30.800 --> 54:35.440]  caught framing people all the time i mean what are you talking about and you catch all these
[54:35.440 --> 54:41.120]  liberal groups constantly staging stuff against themselves they go oh that is true and and so
[54:41.120 --> 54:46.160]  we're not supposed to look at who gains from this when they have a history of lying to us that's all
[54:46.160 --> 54:51.040]  i'm saying is they're the prime suspect and then the same mo comes out and that's why they're
[54:51.040 --> 54:56.800]  scared folks they are attacking the public like you're mind-numbed idiots they think everybody
[54:56.800 --> 55:02.080]  is like the people in the mark dice and info wars.com pieces where they sign petitions to
[55:02.080 --> 55:08.240]  bring a nazi rule in america if it gets the guts but everyone isn't like that i mean yeah they
[55:08.240 --> 55:13.680]  may have half the public like that but those people don't even count there's like one tenth
[55:13.680 --> 55:18.000]  of one percent of people that are like actual globalist minions that actually are in on the
[55:18.000 --> 55:22.400]  plan probably maybe ten percent that work for them one way or another those people are stupid
[55:22.400 --> 55:28.400]  too on average this this plan is so evil you don't sign on to this and win there's no winning with
[55:28.400 --> 55:33.520]  this and david knight that's what i try to get to to people look at all the evil and the learned
[55:33.520 --> 55:40.080]  helplessness the mass.com syndrome the normalcy bias the overton window has been moved into la
[55:40.080 --> 55:46.400]  la land and i am not going to go along with it and i am one of the sanest people in the world
[55:46.400 --> 55:52.960]  and my crew is and i know that from history only an insane person would not be concerned about this
[55:52.960 --> 55:57.440]  david knight you know it bothers me when i see this coming from both the left and the right
[55:57.440 --> 56:04.800]  uh we saw this article earlier in the week from national review incredibly juvenile uh ad hominem
[56:04.800 --> 56:11.440]  attack saying that uh uh you're not about information you're about faith and yet the
[56:11.440 --> 56:17.040]  reality is is that they operate strictly on faith we're supposed to take whatever the new york times
[56:17.040 --> 56:21.440]  says or the national review or the washington post we're supposed to accept that on faith because of
[56:21.440 --> 56:26.400]  who they are or because they use the appeal to authority and say well this is a white house press
[56:26.400 --> 56:30.880]  release and i'm sorry but they don't have a monopoly on truth as a matter of fact we've seen
[56:30.880 --> 56:36.240]  over and over again how they spin it and we see how that's a conspiracy richard nixon is not a
[56:36.240 --> 56:42.320]  crook i'm not a crook that's right i mean take for example this uh thing from the daily beast here
[56:42.320 --> 56:47.520]  where are syria's weapons and then the subtitle says multiple u.s officials tell eli lake the
[56:47.520 --> 56:52.640]  scary truth in many cases we simply don't know and so they talk about the fact that although they're
[56:52.640 --> 56:57.040]  they saw trucks being loaded they were watching via satellite instead of an unmanned aerial
[56:57.040 --> 57:01.680]  vehicle so they didn't see where it went well the bottom line is though they're not asking how do
[57:01.680 --> 57:06.640]  you know those were chemical weapons they're just accepting on faith what the government
[57:06.640 --> 57:11.280]  is telling them and putting that out as if it were the truth we see the same thing happening
[57:11.280 --> 57:15.920]  in the boston bombing and you know we ought to be all concerned it operates on so many different
[57:15.920 --> 57:19.360]  levels i mean there's a domestic agenda with the police state that we saw happening when they did
[57:19.360 --> 57:24.560]  the martial law search in the area that of course many in the mainstream press want to deny even
[57:24.560 --> 57:28.960]  happened even though we've got video of that there's also an international agenda that we
[57:28.960 --> 57:34.000]  talked to c bell edmunds about earlier this week but just as a crime scene we should want to see
[57:34.000 --> 57:39.840]  that justice is done because if justice is not done not only are you punishing an innocent person
[57:39.840 --> 57:45.840]  but you're letting guilty people go free and even if the brothers are engaged in this it's quite
[57:45.840 --> 57:50.880]  obvious to everybody that they didn't act alone so why can't we absolutely and it's and and this
[57:50.880 --> 57:56.080]  is not 1995 where you got six other people in mcveigh and they grabbed 17 surveillance tapes
[57:56.080 --> 58:00.640]  and the fbi agents two years later la times people can look this up i have it in my films
[58:00.640 --> 58:05.360]  i think it's road to tyranny a shot of it in fact i interviewed one of the fbi guys he retired over
[58:05.360 --> 58:09.680]  it we ought to pull up his name and getting back on two guys go public say we saw the tape says
[58:09.680 --> 58:13.760]  mcveigh with six guys america has the right to know well those guys should be carried around
[58:13.760 --> 58:19.200]  on people's shoulders that's a hero and again c bell edmunds working for the fbi listening to
[58:19.200 --> 58:24.240]  the nsa transcripts lou rockwell's got it out at info wars.com she said it on my show five years
[58:24.240 --> 58:29.440]  ago but what's old is now big news today because people are more awake she was listening to stuff
[58:29.440 --> 58:36.720]  three months after 9 11 with the cia still commanding bin laden bin laden is cia he was
[58:36.720 --> 58:52.240]  protected this is gcn the genesis communications radio network in the last two years alone the us

[01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:55.440]  of the articles up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.tv uh but uh going back to
[01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:58.720]  david knight you're going to be joining us with a big news blitz at the bottom of the hour i'm

[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:28.080]  people but that'll be also video streamed at prisonplanet.tv he'll be hosting the fourth hour
[01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:32.720]  and taking your calls uh today but david what else you got coming up at the bottom of the hour
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:37.360]  well we've got some information about uh small businesses um there's an article on infowars
[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:41.760]  they're murdering small business the percentage of self-employed americans is at a record low
[01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:47.440]  and as this article states it's from michael schneider's economic collapse this is something
[01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:51.280]  that's been going on for decades but it's accelerating if you look at the graph that's
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:55.280]  down there it's like an asymptote it's going straight down to zero and there's only about
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:03:00.880]  seven people now seven percent of the people now that have uh small businesses and and it's 90
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:06.240]  percent of the new jobs according to the head of the small business league mr chapman i mean this
[01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:11.600]  that's right this is incredible and this is the plan shut down all real communities that's the
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:16.000]  plan yeah that's the that's the chart right there i was talking about it's just going down like a
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:21.680]  exponentially down to zero and you know it's more than just job creation it's more than just helping
[01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:26.400]  the economy because when you look at small business that is really the mechanism for a
[01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:32.000]  lot of people to change their position in the social strata right it's it's your way that
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:36.880]  really is your hope of change is starting your own company and starting your own business that's
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:41.680]  something that is uh for generations has been something in my family uh you've talked about
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:47.600]  it alex how if you've started today uh would you be able to uh do infowars if you started today
[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:55.520]  it's so if i started today instead of 18 years ago um i i can say we would become a successful
[01:03:55.520 --> 01:04:00.240]  fire in the globalist but nowhere near it would be it'd be five times harder right now now knowing
[01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:06.880]  what i know i could still do it but but if i started over at 21 years old uh and and i'm 39
[01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:12.240]  now there it would be really hard it is so much more difficult and and whenever they do these
[01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:18.080]  regulations all these regulations are typically being driven by corruption of big corporations
[01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:24.160]  putting pressure on the federal government to add unnecessary regulations to make it impossible
[01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:27.520]  most of the burden falls on small businesses and they want to make sure they don't get any
[01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:32.080]  new competition so what they're really doing is they're they're cutting off the lower rungs of
[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:37.280]  the ladder that's right it's big business on record worldwide that always lobbies for regulations that
[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:42.240]  they're exempt from absolutely they're exempt from it or they or they add it into the price of doing
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:46.080]  business just like they're most of the big corporations get tax exemption all right and
[01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:50.240]  that's great but they're lobbying to have higher taxes on us because they get it in corporate
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:55.120]  bailouts uh and and and corporate welfare great job david knight we'll talk to you at the bottom

[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:29.840]  24 wars.com with a clip from the white house basically run anti-american group anti-foreign
[01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:38.800]  banker run msnbc democrats move to exploit terror watch list in new attack on second amendment
[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:44.000]  and they're doing what ron emmanuel called for and obama has said he'll use executive power
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:47.360]  they're saying and they're saying they're going to introduce bills they've done it before but it
[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:53.680]  failed in 2007 it failed the lautenberg bill that just puts you on a no-fly list no judge no jury no
[01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:58.320]  proof no reason there's over two million americans on it last time they released it they say it's
[01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:03.200]  classified and you cannot own a gun anymore in fact you can't buy one and then they just come
[01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:07.680]  and take your guns and they're also saying in the bill they tried to pass that they can just have
[01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:11.840]  governments say they think you're mentally ill the police in texas it was in the austin american
[01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:17.200]  states from a month ago have a bill introduced where they say they think you're crazy like
[01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:22.400]  you're crazy we're taking your kids for cps because because you're homeschooling them and
[01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:26.560]  we say that's illegal when it's not and you're getting mad you're crazy
[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:32.400]  imagine the nazis putting people down in those pits when they shot them and they would have
[01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:36.640]  complained they would have said you're crazy in fact they did they first used them the psychologist
[01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:40.720]  and psychiatrist to take people to the death camps and saying they were mentally ill and they
[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:45.600]  would just the family would get a death certificate saying they died of the flu or they died of this
[01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:52.160]  or that and you know oh your five-year-old died of an aneurysm uh you know or appendicitis
[01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:57.920]  and if you complained oh you're crazy too take the crazy away bye-bye
[01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:05.120]  and we have an article up here rush limbaugh to be sent to mental health hospital under stasi
[01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:10.880]  stench program question mark paul joseph watson and and the reason we say that is the palm beach
[01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:18.160]  where limbaugh lives uh escaping bloomberg's new york uh he had you know he says he hates the
[01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:23.840]  corrupt government they say if you quote say you hate the government call the police on someone
[01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:28.560]  and the police will just come and knock on the door and see if everything's all right
[01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:35.200]  they mean they're going to swat team you that's what they do so there is some of the report and
[01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:39.600]  their big bombshell report from lou rockwell of all people and again this is five-year-old news
[01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:44.880]  but i give it to lou rockwell for going with it because he's respected they interviewed c bella
[01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:47.920]  edmunds she said this before on the show we should have got her talk about that we're talking about
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:52.880]  the new case she listened to the phone intercepts before and after 9 11 where the government was
[01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:58.560]  commanding ben london and commanding the leaders of al-qaeda al-zahari and all the rest of them
[01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:05.280]  who it turned out if some of them were dining secretly at the white house look that up look
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:12.160]  up number three in al-qaeda dine secretly at the pentagon then i predicted that since that came
[01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:16.320]  out they'd staged his death and they did they didn't really kill that guy he's basking in the
[01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:23.520]  malhi sign his debt to society paid in full and who loves you and who do you love the running man
[01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:29.360]  we ought to play that promo intro at the bottom of the hour that john bound put together john

[01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:37.200]  producer work ferreting out news i wanted to get the guy that shot the video or the guy that was
[01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:42.880]  arrested for iced tea uh that's right don't have iced tea in america buddy that's a stimulant
[01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:48.240]  uh i'm not kidding that's coming up uh and then the question is you know will they arrest rush
[01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:53.920]  limbaugh it's a serious question i mean they're always saying i'm crazy and need to be arrested
[01:12:53.920 --> 01:13:01.040]  that guy is crazy dhs this is new and just broke paul joseph watson need to send that over to the
[01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:10.240]  drudgeinator at drudgereport.com dhs seeks millions of more rounds of ammunition market survey
[01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:16.480]  asked companies if they can provide two million bullets within 30 to 60 day period so they're
[01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:23.200]  sending the census out that some businesses get monthly now first was every 10 years then it was
[01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:27.440]  a business census and community census and listeners send me emails and i see the comments
[01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:32.480]  going i don't get a business census you you don't run a business on the radar okay i've shown it on
[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:37.760]  air we get them now every year and they're talking about every month well guess what the bullet
[01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:46.320]  manufacturers at fizz fed biz ops website are now being asked can you and a bunch of companies are
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:55.600]  getting this can you produce millions of bullets two million rounds of ammunition within a very
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:14:01.760]  short notice so they're also trying to ramp up ammo production and then hoard all that and i've
[01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:05.520]  analyzed you want to know what's going on with this this is a big thing and i've talked to my
[01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:10.080]  sources in law enforcement they concur and have said this is what they've been told and you've
[01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:14.320]  heard cops and captains others call in and say that as well but i've confirmed with people i
[01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:20.000]  know are federal marshals secret service fbi and yes we have these sources ladies and gentlemen
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:26.560]  there are a lot of good people still in the government anyways the point is that they're
[01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:31.520]  told oh it's being done to dry up the supply and even this esquire guy said well yeah there's going
[01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:36.240]  to be civil unrest and america's armed to the teeth of course you buy the bullets to keep
[01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:40.000]  people's hands and i go well then why is the media saying we're not well they don't want to add to
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:44.400]  the hysteria that you're adding the government and obama turns out this guy's hooked him with
[01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:50.080]  all these people you know is is really trying to help and what you're doing is dangerous and
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:57.840]  you know we're not really all bad well you may not be a bad guy but i'll assure you the people
[01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:04.720]  running the show that control obama are bad you know it's like albert spear said uh the nazi head
[01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:08.800]  of armaments and a bunch of other stuff he said in the nuremberg trial you don't recognize the
[01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:16.720]  devil when he's got his arm around you and i don't just believe that quote online i don't
[01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:20.800]  just believe you know that quote i actually saw him on pbs interview when i was a kid say that
[01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:27.920]  and you know that's how this whole thing works okay i want to go to your phone calls and i did
[01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:31.200]  get the phone system up for folks that know i am able to see it so thanks to the network
[01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:34.960]  they were texting me who the callers were but i got it launched here
[01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:41.120]  um let's talk to daniel in louisiana uh you're on the air what do you think they're contacting
[01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:46.160]  bullet manufacturers shane can you produce two million bullets on a very short notice
[01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:50.960]  what do you think of that you're listening on xm 166. oh well they're definitely trying to
[01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:56.240]  keep ammunition out of american's hands another thing to take note of is that uh with them
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:16:00.400]  demonizing if you'll notice every time an issue comes up they demonize specifically
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:06.880]  the ar-15 as a weapon oh and if they can ban one they can ban them all but yes they're
[01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:12.720]  they're showing that one one because they know that's light it's easy to use and the american
[01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:18.320]  people can really take on the new world order with it and the fact that uh nato and un troops are
[01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:24.720]  uh outfitted with that platform and they know they don't want us trained on that platform exactly
[01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:28.640]  that's right and to be able to share ammunition well what i called for was that uh yesterday you
[01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:33.520]  know the pentagon released the statement that uh they could possibly be court-martialing anyone
[01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:38.560]  that mentions god or witnesses while they're in uniform and on duty yeah that's fox news and i'm
[01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:43.120]  so conditioned i didn't even cover that and by condition i already know that's so true for a
[01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:47.920]  decade that they're persecuting christians in the military that i didn't even cover it and i could
[01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:53.600]  be literally hitting the nose for that they openly came out and admitted what we already knew if you
[01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:59.280]  talk about jesus when everybody else can talk about whatever they want if you talk about christ
[01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:03.680]  to somebody you will be court-martialed well i say everybody should talk about christ and let
[01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:10.160]  them let them court-martial everybody i'm sorry go ahead uh the news and i they always will they
[01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:17.040]  toned it down my sister is a captain down at port uh port polk in leasville louisiana and yesterday
[01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:22.240]  all army officers were briefed that it is now military policy that if they hear you so much
[01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:28.160]  as say the word god or jesus while you're in uniform and on duty you will be court-martialed
[01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:33.520]  there has not been a sentence set for it but uh that is that that's that is a military across
[01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:37.280]  the board policy it's not just being considered yeah let me just stop you here for those that
[01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:44.000]  don't know when they tricked in 1918 after the 1917 revolution they tricked them the the the
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:48.400]  brass to turn on their guns and then they killed them all a week later then they tricked the general
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:52.160]  military who was going out to turn on their guns because russians were heavily armed like american
[01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:58.560]  used to be uh or still are and they once they tricked them to turn those in then they said
[01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:05.040]  you will not mention god jesus and you will no longer go to your orthodox church or you're dead
[01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:10.880]  and people went along with it and then they were able to take over this is the moment in america
[01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:15.920]  and they're they're going to persecute christians yes pentagon confirms that soldiers could be
[01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:22.960]  court-martialed for sharing faith and uh fox news confirms that new american uh magazine also
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:28.320]  pentagon religious proselytizing is not permitted and and if you actually read the ruling it says
[01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:33.440]  you were not to talk about god uh but everybody else can talk about whatever uh you know there
[01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:37.360]  can be gang recruiting you name it what do you think this is going to do in the military because
[01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:43.520]  i have been besieged in a good way by listeners on the streets of hot springs arkansas and they're
[01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:49.520]  all former military or no military they tell me what i've seen myself let's be conservative that
[01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:55.440]  30 to 40 of the military are listeners of this show know it's true because they're being given
[01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:58.720]  the training they know i'm not lying because they're they're seeing what i've already told
[01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:03.760]  them and that they are totally totally and completely freaked out and i mean the globalists
[01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:08.080]  really think they're going to make the military their enemy what do you make of this well i think
[01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:13.120]  that they want to remove anyone or provide an inroads to remove anyone from the military that
[01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:18.480]  has a fundamental moral or ethical code and even your loosely based christians that are kind of you
[01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:23.360]  know borderline agnostic they still have some sort of a moral code where they value human life and
[01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:27.680]  you know you know what i'm saying and if they could uh create just a system in which they could
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:31.520]  target an individual and say because we know you're a christian we heard you say some off
[01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:35.600]  the cuff comment like oh god not this again or something well you said god you're court martial
[01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:42.560]  you're out but how do you expect people to go into combat and not pray to god you really can't you
[01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:47.760]  can't you can't have a military that's based on because i mean you would have a no no no i mean
[01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:52.400]  i'm gonna be honest these godless people on average are a bunch of cowardly chicken necks
[01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:56.320]  who couldn't fight their way out of a paper bag and the globalists haven't deployed the robots yet
[01:19:57.040 --> 01:20:01.680]  so we're not replaced yet i want to come back to you and see what she said in the last two years

[01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:30.960]  didn't want to distract me but we don't say Infowars is under attack like everybody else
[01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:34.320]  does when their site has a problem or they didn't pay their server bill and it goes down
[01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:44.640]  I have like five top flight IT people and we have big companies and we have multifaceted platforms
[01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:51.280]  and systems we are under attack right now certified multiple attacks denial of service
[01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:57.040]  but others as well ports you know being scanned people trying to break into things from all over
[01:24:57.040 --> 01:25:01.920]  right now very sophisticated attack and we've analyzed it and scanned the ports the guys are
[01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:06.400]  telling me of Breitbart I don't even know if Breitbart knows this but they're intermittently
[01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:10.800]  giving the same service error it looks like they're getting attacked as well we don't know
[01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:16.480]  that with them but it looks like a multifaceted platform attack which is Obama's cybersecurity
[01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:21.920]  system which even CBS News says is Russian or Chinese style net censorship and a program to
[01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:27.040]  take on the alternative media something Cass Sunstein talked about so don't just think Infowars
[01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:31.200]  will always be here listen you notice the and David Knight was just talking about this a few
[01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:37.920]  days ago before this even broke on Fox News that they're they're coming out and saying Christians
[01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:43.120]  are bad period it's treason that was the quote this is what they're saying in federal briefings
[01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:47.520]  to see separation of church and state means the government can't be involved in your religion
[01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:52.080]  and can make no law it doesn't mean they can tell you you can't bring a bible to school
[01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:57.840]  or you can't tell kids on the playground I love Jesus or you can say I love you know GI Joe or
[01:25:57.840 --> 01:26:03.520]  I love My Little Pony I love Jesus but they're like oh no that's not allowed and you see all
[01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:09.520]  these cases these are radical authoritarians who their god is the state and going back to the
[01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:12.560]  caller of David Knight is still there in studio and I'll get to all the callers if you notice
[01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:16.240]  this caller's getting a lot of time because he brings up stuff that's on record listening on
[01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:26.560]  xm 166 the switches in about four days to xm 244 Daniel what did your sister say with the officers
[01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:30.880]  that were sat down and told you said it's more radical than even what we're told in the news
[01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:37.440]  and what effect did she say of any this had on morale I mean this is this is the Roman empire
[01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:41.760]  a hundred years into Christianity had to let their soldiers be Christian because so many had
[01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:47.280]  I mean this is this is unpro this is history repeating itself yet again this is so over the
[01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:52.400]  top super creepville total proof of everything we're talking about I mean they're building
[01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:58.400]  worship centers at Fort Hood for the pagans to have their stuff and again they any religion goes
[01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:03.600]  but Christianity go ahead tell us what she was saying about that Daniel well the main thing that
[01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:07.520]  she stressed to me was that all the media was going to probably paint it as though there were
[01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:12.880]  some flexibility and but that as far as the way they were there would be no tolerance and no
[01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:18.560]  flexibility whatsoever that um that there would be no lenience and uh and that would be one thing to
[01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:22.880]  look for that they're really downplaying it in the media media as they always do but uh the the
[01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:27.680]  gist of her uh message to me was just that she was you know asking for prayer and for prayer for all
[01:27:27.680 --> 01:27:31.920]  of the soldiers because there are a lot of good people in that position now that they could be
[01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:36.800]  you know punished for something that's a basic human right well I have a cousin who's been in
[01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:41.680]  the military as a non-commissioned officer who's gone about as high as you can go let's leave it
[01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:46.400]  at that who's been in 24 years he's got one more year and he wanted to go back to combat
[01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:51.840]  he's a great guy but in his words he wants to dial a pile of brass it's like you know serious
[01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:59.760]  Nordic type mindset and he told me six years ago he apologized at a family reunion I mean he's
[01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:04.400]  pretty close family I see him all the time he comes over my parents house all the time and he
[01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:09.520]  apologized he said it's true about what you said about the new world order we've all been told he
[01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:13.760]  told me the base where they were told that we're all going to get microchips and I later confirmed
[01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:18.080]  a lot of troops have gotten these chips and we're doing it as a test and then now he said national
[01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:22.320]  security I can't talk to you at all I probably didn't get promoted to an even higher level
[01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:27.760]  they brought you up and I go well is it secret about the chip and he goes just don't talk about
[01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:31.760]  me anymore well I'm sorry I mean I'm not saying your name but they obviously know you are I mean
[01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:35.520]  come on bud uh and I know you want to go fly around and do all the stuff you know you're
[01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:41.520]  addicted to it that guy's been everywhere I mean Latin America Asia Middle East when I was a kid
[01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:45.520]  he was being deployed in the Middle East for the first time I remember him in his uniform marching
[01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:50.960]  off to be deployed to covert operations but I mean you know these guys already got microchips I mean
[01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:54.800]  I could have them call in right now what do you make of that I mean they use the military as their
[01:28:54.800 --> 01:29:01.360]  guinea pigs uh it's it's so hard to say because there are so many variables but it's just I do
[01:29:01.360 --> 01:29:05.840]  believe that they test a lot of that technology that they would like to use on us later in the
[01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:09.600]  military because they know they can get away with it they know those a lot of those guys especially
[01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:15.040]  in higher positions have no choice um and so they'll use them as a test bed to test the technology
[01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:20.080]  for one uh the other is dead on I think they let a little bit of that information leak out over time
[01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:24.960]  just to kind of introduce that rhetoric to the public absolutely god bless you David Knight we're
[01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:29.520]  going out to break but after our guest leaves us here and you're going to be riding shotgun right
[01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:35.120]  now I want to get David Knight to take on this because folks I mean man it doesn't matter who
[01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:41.360]  you are there's a war on Christians they have taken the churches over they've made them 501c3
[01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:45.040]  they're taking the crosses out and if your preacher isn't talking about this
[01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:48.720]  they're a wicked devil and you to leave that church because it's not a church

[01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:44.560]  in fayetteville north carolina that shot the video that has gone viral since it went up on
[01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:51.840]  infowars.com man drinking iced tea in parking lot gets arrested a can of tea can apparently land you
[01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:58.000]  in the can and well yeah it was drinking the iced tea and and i mean this is so well known probably
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:05.520]  one of the best-selling drinks out there is arnold palmer's arizona iced tea well he explained it to
[01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:10.560]  the state liquor officer and for those that don't know most of the east coast from the old south
[01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:18.480]  if any type of alcohol is sold it is a state store and the state runs it and
[01:34:18.480 --> 01:34:26.000]  you've got the liquor police running around trying to stop everybody and it is a real travesty to see
[01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:31.200]  all this unfold we're going to go to tino brown who shot the video here in a moment of the
[01:34:31.200 --> 01:34:37.440]  un-uniformed this is a police state we're not here to bash police yourselves but the people directing
[01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:41.760]  the system we have the most prisons anywhere in the world they're building more they're making
[01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:48.080]  felonies now for basically picking your nose and the government's run by corporations and
[01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:52.320]  it's run by criminals that launder hundreds of billions of drug money a year publicly like
[01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:58.080]  wells fargo and makovia and no one gets in trouble and the public are just a bunch of dumb
[01:34:58.080 --> 01:35:03.600]  down chumps basically they're being fed on and this is a recipe for disaster historically for
[01:35:03.600 --> 01:35:07.680]  those that don't know we're going to tino brown in a moment but give people the details of this
[01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:14.720]  because i know you're from north carolina david knight they're giving us a news breakdown and
[01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:20.000]  then john bound has also been contacted by the fatville police and so he's got some additional
[01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:25.840]  info on this before we go to tino brown to get his tag uh david knight well alex all i know about it
[01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:30.800]  because uh i don't drink as a personal choice but uh all i know about it is that like you said in
[01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:35.440]  north carolina only the state is allowed to sell anything other than beer or wine so you have to
[01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:39.760]  go to an abc store they're run by the north carolina state government which makes the north
[01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:45.680]  carolina state government the largest drug pusher in the state but anyway this i don't know anything
[01:35:45.680 --> 01:35:51.600]  about it except this is evidently somebody that's not a regular police officer this is somebody that
[01:35:51.600 --> 01:35:57.360]  belongs to that particular bureaucracy and uh just like you see with bureaucrats everywhere they're
[01:35:57.360 --> 01:36:02.880]  on this power trip you know and really kind of setting this up to entrap people and we see this
[01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:06.800]  happening more often to minorities than we do other people when you look at how you look at
[01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:11.600]  the ratio of people that are arrested for marijuana and that sort of thing uh it it's
[01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:16.160]  very skewed in terms of the population i mean it's it's bad that this is happening to anybody
[01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:21.680]  but it absolutely does uh skew if you look at the statistics yeah i don't know how to produce
[01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:27.680]  uh to pronounce it right kombucha tea yeah my wife likes it my kids like it and it had like
[01:36:28.560 --> 01:36:33.200]  maybe half a percent alcohol and you have to drink like you know 30 bottles of it to even
[01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:38.320]  feel anything and they made them cut it down and basically ruin it to have basically no alcohol in
[01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:45.360]  it and now there's these other uh restaurants and uh places that put out the other type of sauces
[01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:49.680]  and are being told we're gonna arrest you too nothing can have any alcohol they're talking
[01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:56.320]  about making uh scope and listerine which no one would drink to get high and kill you uh they're
[01:36:56.320 --> 01:37:03.040]  trying to make that illegal of others moves i've seen so it's all about finding new ways to get you
[01:37:03.040 --> 01:37:08.880]  and uh i saw articles about arrest and they would have liquor swat team raids on stores that when
[01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:14.480]  they finally passed the state laws in different states uh that if they hadn't got it off the
[01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:19.440]  shelves in time they would clap them in handcuffs and try to put the store owners in jail who didn't
[01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:28.080]  even know uh how do you pronounce it kombucha tea and yeah kombucha okay um yeah and that tea is an
[01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:33.280]  asian tea it's got a very very minor amount of fermentation and it has other health benefits and
[01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:38.240]  there was a case uh not too long ago where some child uh a lot of people will brew this in their
[01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:44.400]  own home they'll they'll keep that uh fermentation going and a mother was giving that to her uh child
[01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:49.120]  on a regular basis and the family and the child of course got in a great deal of trouble with
[01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:52.800]  the government school over that they treated it as if the mother was giving them whiskey or
[01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:59.200]  something on a oh yeah i've seen i've seen arrest over a ludens cough drop that should be in the
[01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:04.400]  candy aisle there's not even it was a cherry ludens in the case not even menthol in there
[01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:09.520]  it was not a drug but don't worry they arrested her while the government ships the narcotics in
[01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:14.480]  they ship it in to then watch us the slaves get it and then throw us in their prisons this is the
[01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:19.440]  new modern slavery they know what they're doing they brought down china with it look up the opium

[01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:41.520]  and a badge and they walked over real aggressive and their eyes were twinkling and they talked to
[01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:45.680]  him and he was sitting there sawing in his front yard and he looked at him and they were and they
[01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:50.560]  saw me filming and got all aggressive i have some of it on tape i've never uploaded it yet and
[01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:53.680]  because the neighbor kind of got freaked out and said hey man i don't want to be on tv but i'm a
[01:39:53.680 --> 01:39:58.880]  listener but the point was is they're like crazed they're like looking at you like i'm scaring you

[01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:18.720]  well i'm just saying they're vampires they're petty tyrants and if you watch the video that
[01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:25.040]  uh x as i call him uh extravagant is the name of the rapper he clearly does nothing wrong at all
[01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:30.400]  that anybody anybody would have done that he's and by the way he's even a clean-cut looking guy
[01:40:30.400 --> 01:40:34.880]  he's not enough of the guy this guy's not a criminal this guy's just waiting to meet some
[01:40:34.880 --> 01:40:40.720]  people to shoot a video later on his music's not even up loud coming out of his car you can clearly
[01:40:40.720 --> 01:40:45.600]  hear him talking his his music's not even loud yeah you can't even sit in a parking lot by a gas
[01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:52.560]  station it's a truck and and and and drink a nice tea no no i've i've been sitting there uh you know
[01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:58.160]  by the airport when i had to pick up dave mustang a few weeks ago uh and and his flight was a little
[01:40:58.160 --> 01:41:02.160]  bit late so i stopped at the gas station down from the airport i went and bought some chips
[01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:09.040]  bought a bottle of water i'm sitting there uh surfing my iphone and what are you doing and i
[01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:12.960]  was like i'm waiting for somebody well you can't wait here i said did the store call you i've only
[01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:18.000]  been here 10 minutes and and he's like nope but you need to move along i mean it's just all about
[01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:25.360]  i'm in control i'm your boss you are scum get used to it uh let's bring up tino brown tino tell us
[01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:30.640]  when this happened uh what else happened behind the scenes break down uh what you saw go on here
[01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:36.960]  tino okay well uh first i'd like to say thanks for having me on the show mr jones and uh hello
[01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:42.640]  to all the other guests as well what happened uh that day was extravagant i'm an independent
[01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:50.240]  filmmaker he called me to do a music video for him and uh i came out i shot the music video form
[01:41:50.240 --> 01:41:54.800]  we were on our way to another location to do another scene and they were like you know let's
[01:41:54.800 --> 01:41:59.520]  stop and grab a couple of drinks from the liquor store and uh we pulled up to the liquor store and
[01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:03.840]  i figured you know let's get a little extra footage you know just in case i may find something
[01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:09.840]  to edit to throw in in the video and as soon as he pulled up pretty much the the video speaks for
[01:42:09.840 --> 01:42:16.160]  itself that's exactly what happened you know as you see i'm parked near the garbage can so it was
[01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:22.880]  very shortly after i jumped out the car that i was able to film him so uh right from that point we i
[01:42:22.880 --> 01:42:27.520]  just and the liquor cop i mean i mean the liquor cop can't admit he's wrong later he's just gotta
[01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:30.880]  i mean why do you think you still arrested him for tea break down what happened for radio
[01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:36.480]  listeners who haven't seen the video well what happened was he came over assuming that it was
[01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:42.160]  alcohol the tall can you know i guess the assumption african-americans malt liquor tall
[01:42:42.160 --> 01:42:48.240]  cans uh so when he came over of course we were both startled there was no a uniform it was just
[01:42:48.240 --> 01:42:52.880]  like a stranger coming up and he kept he's coming aggressively so he's like what are you drinking
[01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:58.240]  and he said well who are you i'm drinking tea so he tries to grab the can and he says no i'm not
[01:42:58.240 --> 01:43:03.280]  gonna i'm not gonna let you grab it so he shows it to him he reads it to him half and half sweet tea
[01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:09.440]  and the guy says well let me read the ingredients and which seems both to us just an excuse because
[01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:17.200]  everyone knows arizona iced tea does not put alcohol in that iced tea i mean i i probably
[01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:23.280]  couldn't have controlled myself i mean if you watch the video and it's just a crazy weirdo
[01:43:23.280 --> 01:43:27.520]  who never gets sick of messing with people i mean if he pulled up and people are totally drunk in a
[01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:33.680]  car boom you got them cops come over it's a done deal but i mean it's an iced tea it says iced tea
[01:43:33.680 --> 01:43:39.920]  it's one of the biggest sellers in the country yeah and people are the main question online is
[01:43:39.920 --> 01:43:45.040]  well did he spike it beforehand no one knows but the truth is this first of all i'm a 35 year old
[01:43:45.040 --> 01:43:50.880]  man if i drink alcohol i can legally and i'll tell you if i did and he's over 21 as well as well he
[01:43:50.880 --> 01:43:55.120]  served in the military for over five years and he fought and that's why they probably hate him but
[01:43:55.120 --> 01:44:01.600]  again we're all enemies we put in prison the point is is they look for any excuse in this but please
[01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:07.280]  continue yeah but i guess i'm just going to end it with as you see we never made it inside the
[01:44:07.280 --> 01:44:13.120]  liquor store so it's you know so there was no liquor inside of that iced tea and i guess my
[01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:18.960]  point is people are saying we should have just let them smell it well he asked for the ingredients
[01:44:18.960 --> 01:44:23.200]  he didn't ask to smell it maybe he wanted to smell it but he actually asked to look at the
[01:44:23.200 --> 01:44:28.720]  ingredients and uh it would have been totally irrelevant looking at a arizona iced tea cans
[01:44:28.720 --> 01:44:36.080]  ingredients in austin they've got billboards up flashing saying don't drink and walk and the
[01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:39.840]  people are like well that's reasonable ever heard of public intoxication and they had a guy who
[01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:46.160]  drank three beers in his own hotel uh steakhouse down at the radisson in downtown austin i've
[01:44:46.160 --> 01:44:51.200]  eaten down there there's a steakhouse down there the cop watched him drink three beers over two
[01:44:51.200 --> 01:44:56.240]  hours he was a businessman who'd flown in done the meeting watches a baseball game drinks three
[01:44:56.240 --> 01:45:02.880]  miller lights and is going to go up to his room and they famously arrested him for being drunk in
[01:45:02.880 --> 01:45:10.320]  public over two hours a businessman in a sports jacket eating a steak cannot drink three beers
[01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:16.720]  over two hours watching a baseball game is that a free country to go to his hotel room and go to
[01:45:16.720 --> 01:45:22.240]  sleep i mean this is crap i'm sorry sir i'm ranting so break down the arrest what did you
[01:45:22.240 --> 01:45:26.160]  think once that started i mean break down when he wants to see the ingredients he's already shown it
[01:45:26.160 --> 01:45:31.920]  to him what happens next well he he shows him what it says it's iced tea and then he says no
[01:45:31.920 --> 01:45:37.440]  put it in my hand let me read the ingredients and at this point like i said he hasn't showed a badge
[01:45:37.440 --> 01:45:41.920]  it's still it's like a stranger so it's like who are you he says the police he hasn't showed
[01:45:41.920 --> 01:45:47.040]  identification so no one's going to hand them over to tea for him to put his nose or his lips on it
[01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:53.600]  and then at that point he starts to get aggressive with extrav and everyone knew and i felt like our
[01:45:53.600 --> 01:46:00.080]  rights were just being totally violated i mean it was i just felt violated everyone felt violated
[01:46:00.080 --> 01:46:06.080]  even onlookers felt violated because we all felt like i felt like that could have been me he could
[01:46:06.080 --> 01:46:10.320]  have been have the camera on me hey let me hold the camera and you talk a little bit and that
[01:46:10.320 --> 01:46:15.520]  could have been me with a can in my hand and you know it totally crossed my it didn't cross my mind
[01:46:15.520 --> 01:46:22.480]  until afterwards that i may i looked and i i found you know travon died from iced tea and skittles of
[01:46:22.480 --> 01:46:29.200]  arizona iced tea and it's like you know what's going on here you know so i felt totally violated
[01:46:29.200 --> 01:46:35.440]  just to look at it this has been my friend for over 10 years he served in the military for over
[01:46:35.440 --> 01:46:42.240]  five years i don't know if this security guard has but he's been to iraq i just felt totally
[01:46:42.240 --> 01:46:49.040]  violent can i jump in for a second yes sir i just want to add that uh it the shock that you feel is
[01:46:49.040 --> 01:46:56.240]  that it feels like an entire generation is being arrested right in front of you yes for just being
[01:46:56.240 --> 01:47:02.560]  you you know yes and that's it well the issue is the system it is like lions eating gazelles
[01:47:02.560 --> 01:47:09.200]  it sees us as food and the secret police security guard just shows up and says i'm give me your
[01:47:09.200 --> 01:47:14.720]  drink doesn't even say who he is and it's so and i'd be like who are you tell me who you are it
[01:47:14.720 --> 01:47:19.040]  would have never even gotten past that then i'd say what's your probable cause and i'd say i'm
[01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:24.640]  leaving you can do whatever you want but instead instead you act nice and then it gets to this
[01:47:24.640 --> 01:47:30.960]  point so then what what came next for uh for radio listeners uh what happened after that he was
[01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:36.960]  thrown to the ground grabbed by his neck uh just manhandled basically in front of everyone in
[01:47:36.960 --> 01:47:43.520]  public he was cuffed he was on the ground and it kind of reminded me just uh animal like a deer you
[01:47:43.520 --> 01:47:48.240]  know when they shoot them and and they kind of just leave them there to and that's kind of how
[01:47:48.240 --> 01:47:52.800]  no that's what the training is we are animals this is you've hit the heart of the new world order
[01:47:52.800 --> 01:48:00.160]  their their god we're animals go ahead and uh and then eventually a actual police car pulled up
[01:48:00.160 --> 01:48:05.840]  and the cop comes out running and and by that time there's three four people filming now
[01:48:05.840 --> 01:48:11.280]  and uh i asked the cop you know do you want to see the evidence you want to see the evidence
[01:48:11.280 --> 01:48:15.520]  and you know of course as you can see in the footage it it did nothing mattered
[01:48:15.520 --> 01:48:22.800]  and um he was going to be honest i'm surprised this guy uh starts grabbing him and uh extravagant
[01:48:22.800 --> 01:48:27.360]  didn't do something because i mean i'm i mean it's just what these are is wimps who want to
[01:48:27.360 --> 01:48:31.840]  beat people up but don't want to be in a real fight and i'm really sick of it i mean that's
[01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:39.360]  what i'm telling you right now yeah and you know what um like i said before extrav is is a former
[01:48:39.360 --> 01:48:46.400]  military uh soldier he's very well disciplined and he's also very well trained for combat
[01:48:46.400 --> 01:48:51.760]  and since he's had experience in iraq you know he knew what he was capable of but he also knew the
[01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:57.040]  consequences so you know it was just a situation no no i understand i'm saying it showed incredible
[01:48:57.040 --> 01:49:02.960]  restraint now they always like to trump stuff up after after they've set you up uh where is all
[01:49:02.960 --> 01:49:10.160]  this going now uh right now he has a court date set for june 6 in fayetteville north carolina and
[01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:17.040]  we we'd like for any supporters or anyone who wants to to uh voice their opinion on the situation
[01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:24.720]  um they can follow me on twitter at tino brown 315 and they can uh also just keep staying on top
[01:49:24.720 --> 01:49:30.080]  of the youtube channel and it's going to absolutely he should make a rap video or hip-hop video
[01:49:30.080 --> 01:49:35.280]  about this in the constitution it'd be super hot that's how you fight back as in the info war
[01:49:35.280 --> 01:49:41.120]  you know what mr jones i i want to really commend you because right now he's in the studio working
[01:49:41.120 --> 01:49:47.440]  on it and and we're doing a video for it and it's going to be something that it's it's about rights
[01:49:47.440 --> 01:49:51.920]  and the people and it's it's going to be something that if you stand up for this it's going to be
[01:49:51.920 --> 01:49:56.160]  something that you can share and going to want to support the power he's going to speak on it
[01:49:56.160 --> 01:50:00.800]  good absolutely i want to do another segment and get john bound and uh david knight's take on this
[01:50:00.800 --> 01:50:04.160]  we're going to come back in the next hour and take calls but but you know now they're saying
[01:50:04.160 --> 01:50:09.760]  the military can't talk about jesus all our basic rights as individuals are being taken and so the
[01:50:09.760 --> 01:50:13.600]  cops are trying to act like they weren't part of this but but i mean fayetteville police did show
[01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:18.720]  up they're all part of this it's part of their system and were they all proud when they put him
[01:50:18.720 --> 01:50:23.440]  in the police car and took him to jail and and what are they charging him with uh they charged
[01:50:23.440 --> 01:50:31.120]  them with uh trespassing and resisting arrests which everyone saw he he didn't elbow or throw
[01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:35.920]  a punch or yeah yeah and and and that's a felony in a lot of areas i saw that in the news i was
[01:50:35.920 --> 01:50:39.360]  just making sure it was accurate now we're gonna come back and talk about this folks not only has
[01:50:39.360 --> 01:50:45.520]  he gone to jail for tea for iced tea now it's open for business place he never gets there to buy

[01:54:35.280 --> 01:54:39.040]  the tyranny he's gonna pop in after we take a bunch of your calls I appreciate people holding
[01:54:39.040 --> 01:54:45.920]  look I'm ranching Tino Brown you shot the video it just so upsets me that you know uh you guys
[01:54:45.920 --> 01:54:50.720]  are polite you're nice you're like it's a nice tea he does this then they manhandling they
[01:54:50.720 --> 01:54:56.160]  basically attack him tie him up like an animal and then charge him with resisting and I think
[01:54:56.160 --> 01:55:00.320]  they all need to be sued I mean it's just government needs to be brought under heel
[01:55:00.320 --> 01:55:06.400]  it's out of control it thinks it's god and other points you'd like to add about uh you know the
[01:55:06.400 --> 01:55:11.040]  Fayetteville police are acting like they're not part of this is that true uh yes they are acting
[01:55:11.040 --> 01:55:16.880]  like they're not part of it and uh I can't confirm but from what I read online they they're saying
[01:55:16.880 --> 01:55:23.920]  that ABC is saying that the officer acted uh within law and he did his job correctly
[01:55:25.600 --> 01:55:30.720]  yeah they arrest people in Austin and Lagovista for not wearing seat belts a woman was getting
[01:55:30.720 --> 01:55:34.880]  their mail like 200 yards from her house and took her seat belt off to get it and they they
[01:55:34.880 --> 01:55:38.640]  took her kids too so I think you ought to permanently take their kids and send them
[01:55:38.640 --> 01:55:42.640]  to Siberia for no seat belt this is what these tyrants will do they do it in every case in
[01:55:42.640 --> 01:55:46.960]  history I'm sorry I'm ranting other points you or John Bowne or David Knight would like to add
[01:55:46.960 --> 01:55:53.520]  anything else you'd like to add Tino Brown I just think that people should continuously stand up
[01:55:53.520 --> 01:55:58.320]  for things like this you know there's there's cases like this that go on every day in America
[01:55:58.320 --> 01:56:04.480]  unfortunately um artists you know they're they aren't followed by HD cameras like you know how
[01:56:04.480 --> 01:56:10.640]  I followed Xtrav that day but um if you see something like this I would just urge anyone
[01:56:10.640 --> 01:56:17.520]  to report it to websites like yours people like yourself um and other outlets as well as local
[01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:23.840]  media stations and and please just stand by your word and and know your constitution and stand for
[01:56:23.840 --> 01:56:29.200]  your constitution because it was written by the forefathers and it's the law of the land it's
[01:56:29.200 --> 01:56:36.480]  over federal and state know it and don't let them violate it absolutely I would say things I mean
[01:56:36.480 --> 01:56:39.680]  you know what to wrap but I'd say if you could take it from if they could take it from me they
[01:56:39.680 --> 01:56:45.360]  can take it from you that's right and and I mean I would just you know break it down they I mean
[01:56:45.360 --> 01:56:48.800]  they think that we're their slaves they think they're turning this whole thing into a big
[01:56:48.800 --> 01:56:53.440]  prison and and it's time for the good cops to stand up and say no to this but man I tell you
[01:56:53.440 --> 01:56:58.720]  these liquor enforcement people are the worst did you know in Texas they arrest people for drinking
[01:56:58.720 --> 01:57:08.640]  even one or two beers in a bar wow I'm not joking in a bar the guys pull it up a man arrested for
[01:57:08.640 --> 01:57:15.920]  drinking three beers in Austin bar absolutely I mean these are nuts yeah I live in it Alex can I
[01:57:15.920 --> 01:57:20.880]  say something here yes yes go ahead one of the things that's changed here is exactly what Tino
[01:57:20.880 --> 01:57:25.920]  Brown did and that is video taking video and everybody's got a cell phone almost all cell
[01:57:25.920 --> 01:57:31.600]  phones take videos now so now there's a lot of eyes out on the street you know Peter King said
[01:57:31.600 --> 01:57:36.480]  that they needed more cameras because the Boston bombing well he didn't want more of us to have
[01:57:36.480 --> 01:57:40.400]  cameras he wanted the government to have the cameras but the the fact that we've got video
[01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:44.720]  the fact that we've got internet that's what can change some of this that's what can change public
[01:57:44.720 --> 01:57:49.520]  opinion and like you said I look at that even as somebody that doesn't drink somebody's not black I
[01:57:49.520 --> 01:57:54.560]  don't that makes me feel insecure to see that the police can do that and get away with it and right
[01:57:54.560 --> 01:57:58.800]  now they're still getting away with it you can sue them and you can get some money out of that
[01:57:58.800 --> 01:58:03.520]  but what's going to happen to the officers that do that absolutely nothing and they would have
[01:58:03.520 --> 01:58:07.680]  resisted which would be a normal human instinct they'd have killed him absolutely and the other
[01:58:07.680 --> 01:58:12.400]  issue is they still charge you when you don't resist yeah that guy undoubtedly undoubtedly
[01:58:12.400 --> 01:58:17.280]  extrav was probably putting iraqis in paddy wagons that you know be sent off to wherever
[01:58:17.280 --> 01:58:23.280]  so he knew yeah so he controlled himself but that still wasn't good enough being run over by tyranny
[01:58:23.280 --> 01:58:27.760]  submitting isn't even enough for these people and that's what's crazy Tino Brown I want to
[01:58:27.760 --> 01:58:33.120]  invite you to get extrav on asap on the nightly news or next week because I want to break this
[01:58:33.120 --> 01:58:36.960]  tonight if you can get him I'd like to have you on the nightly news to have him talk about this

[02:01:07.040 --> 02:01:12.800]  little red cup piers morgan you're on the air alex um i i just want you to know it's going to be an
[02:01:12.800 --> 02:01:19.040]  honor for you to talk to me and i'll tell you why because you're a humble guy i know that and i'm
[02:01:19.040 --> 02:01:25.680]  going to promote you to general well from now on we're going to call you general jones and here's
[02:01:25.680 --> 02:01:35.600]  why because when you were on that pierce morgan program um it was absolutely amazing finally
[02:01:35.600 --> 02:01:42.160]  someone got out there and spoke up now a lot of people called you uh too aggressive and i know
[02:01:42.160 --> 02:01:48.240]  that you were a little concerned about it after after the fact but no not to be concerned because
[02:01:48.240 --> 02:01:54.720]  that's what we need now um uh this isn't about hating the government it's definitely in my
[02:01:54.720 --> 02:02:02.960]  opinion it's about loving liberty how much do you love liberty so i would say to all of your
[02:02:02.960 --> 02:02:11.520]  listeners just just speak out uh you don't have to you know you don't have to go crazy you certainly
[02:02:11.520 --> 02:02:17.040]  don't want to get uh going to any kind of a you know cause disruption but all you have to do is
[02:02:17.040 --> 02:02:22.800]  speak out because it's civil disobedience and it begins with speaking up and saying i know you want
[02:02:22.800 --> 02:02:28.240]  to confiscate my guns and make me a slave stop playing games break the silence break the trance
[02:02:28.240 --> 02:02:34.080]  and i i'm i'm able to analyze what i've what i've done instinctively against them and it's the stuff
[02:02:34.080 --> 02:02:38.960]  of history that defeats tyrants and i'm telling you we didn't become free by laying down liberty
[02:02:38.960 --> 02:02:43.920]  and freedom is not given it is taken it is demanded and that's what we've got to do and
[02:02:43.920 --> 02:02:50.320]  anything else carrie yes yes but but here's here's the thing now you're again you've been promoted to
[02:02:50.320 --> 02:02:58.560]  general um uh and of course you know i'm kidding you but but uh most people are not as aggressive
[02:02:58.560 --> 02:03:03.120]  as you they could never be that aggressive but they could talk to their neighbors they could
[02:03:03.120 --> 02:03:07.680]  talk to their friends they could talk to a stranger that they might meet sure i'm not
[02:03:07.680 --> 02:03:13.360]  aggressive in person i'm a big sweetie pie when people are dominating me and robbing me of my
[02:03:13.360 --> 02:03:18.960]  liberty man i get mad if i if i saw a guy stealing my car i'd get i don't even care about it that
[02:03:18.960 --> 02:03:23.360]  much i know i got it i'd you know get it but i'd still be like ah man that feel violated and i
[02:03:23.360 --> 02:03:27.520]  feel violated about where i live you know but it's the same thing it's like when criminals
[02:03:27.520 --> 02:03:33.040]  rob your house that feeling of being violated and it's happened to me before that's what i feel like
[02:03:33.040 --> 02:03:37.520]  it's like man knock and and then and then they sit there and lecture us how great they are no
[02:03:37.520 --> 02:03:42.560]  you're acting like a bunch of crooks i believe that that was a turning point i believe that when
[02:03:42.560 --> 02:03:47.200]  you were on the pierce morgan show that was a turning point for the movement of liberty for
[02:03:47.200 --> 02:03:55.280]  move for liberty i sincerely believe that because people all of a sudden people i think woke up even
[02:03:55.280 --> 02:04:02.480]  the the lame brains in the media said hey what's what's this all about and it really it really got
[02:04:03.200 --> 02:04:10.080]  people to recognize um that there is a movement going on and it is it is really all about info
[02:04:10.080 --> 02:04:16.560]  wars it really is about info wars and that's why i say people have to speak up it's it's information
[02:04:16.560 --> 02:04:24.080]  now you mentioned earlier and then and then i'll give other callers a chance um you mentioned
[02:04:24.080 --> 02:04:30.880]  earlier about uh you you needing uh people to uh help your cause uh what about writers
[02:04:33.120 --> 02:04:37.040]  yeah we're too overwhelmed to even go collect all the people that have websites that are good
[02:04:37.040 --> 02:04:40.960]  writers and get them to be on info wars when these people to send us good stuff people create their
[02:04:40.960 --> 02:04:46.160]  own sites i mean i think it's just an idea but you're right what a freaky thing info wars is one
[02:04:46.160 --> 02:04:51.600]  of the main resistance systems worldwide in the new world order because i was willing to do it and

[02:09:18.640 --> 02:09:23.360]  up at drugsreport.com i want to get this over on info wars.com i know kurt nemo wrote about it
[02:09:23.360 --> 02:09:28.000]  paul watson wrote about it three years ago that they were going to blame mexican violence on gun
[02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:33.520]  owners and then fast and furious came out that it was their plan to indeed blame the violence
[02:09:33.520 --> 02:09:38.800]  they engineered that's they saved in the memos it's time to flash that back nobody even knows
[02:09:38.800 --> 02:09:44.080]  that people go really cbs reported the memo said it was done to blame the second amendment yes we
[02:09:44.080 --> 02:09:49.600]  have them a false flag and as larry pratt said if they'd staged that false flag they'd stage anything
[02:09:50.960 --> 02:09:57.840]  so we need to do an article on this he goes to mexico an incredible photo and blames
[02:09:57.840 --> 02:10:02.240]  mexican violence on u.s guns when the mexican government took the guns from their people
[02:10:02.960 --> 02:10:10.480]  so the criminals and the government can run everything real clear politics with the transcript
[02:10:10.480 --> 02:10:14.080]  most of the guns used to commit violence here in mexico come from the united states not true
[02:10:14.720 --> 02:10:19.120]  president obama fully auto hand grenades you name it it's being flown in by u.s banks
[02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:25.360]  said during a speech of mexico's anthropology museum i think many of you know it's america
[02:10:25.360 --> 02:10:29.200]  our constitution guarantees our individual right to bear arms and as a president i swore an oath
[02:10:29.200 --> 02:10:34.400]  to uphold that right and i always will but at the same time she needs to say the second bloomberg
[02:10:34.400 --> 02:10:38.320]  says he loves the second amendment means you turn your guns in but at the same time as i've said the
[02:10:38.320 --> 02:10:42.560]  united states i will continue to do everything in my power to pass common sense reforms that
[02:10:42.560 --> 02:10:47.200]  keep guns out of the hands of criminals and dangerous people that can save lives here in
[02:10:47.200 --> 02:10:52.160]  mexico and back home the united states it's the right thing to do so he's trying to neutralize
[02:10:52.160 --> 02:10:59.440]  opposition while energizing his base when they're the ones that staged it unbelievable and then
[02:10:59.440 --> 02:11:05.440]  there's this story getting no attention it needs to get attention info awards.com dhs seeks millions

[02:12:33.520 --> 02:12:38.080]  crying out in the wilderness people need to wake up and pay attention and listen to you and get
[02:12:38.080 --> 02:12:43.520]  right with god as a canadian i'm freaked out about the purchase of billions of rounds and
[02:12:43.520 --> 02:12:48.560]  2700 anti-mine tanks that the department of homeland security's purchased for use on the usa
[02:12:48.560 --> 02:12:54.640]  soil we're living in really dangerous times and alex satan wants to rip you to shred i pray for
[02:12:54.640 --> 02:12:58.800]  you and your family's safety because the elites are starting to get really desperate and i fear
[02:12:58.800 --> 02:13:03.280]  they will do desperate things they might come after you so be really no no no i mean i mean
[02:13:03.280 --> 02:13:08.800]  homeland security admits their architecture is to fight veterans and active duty and they're now
[02:13:08.800 --> 02:13:13.280]  saying they're the number one terrorist i never really agreed with this because i didn't believe
[02:13:13.280 --> 02:13:18.240]  they could pull it off but their entire battle plan and what's official is to use 15 nations
[02:13:18.240 --> 02:13:24.160]  during a uprising in america and i think they may actually nuka should invade with foreign troops
[02:13:24.720 --> 02:13:28.240]  because i've been i mean i'm not saying that's going to happen but if i look as a military
[02:13:28.240 --> 02:13:33.840]  a person that studied military history and actions and what they admit or maybe they're
[02:13:33.840 --> 02:13:39.600]  just really on a power trip they really want to start a civil war and take on 10 million veterans
[02:13:39.600 --> 02:13:43.920]  and about half the military and they really think they're going to get away with it they're crazy
[02:13:44.560 --> 02:13:50.000]  they are they are out of their gourd looney tune they're already in control they're already stealing
[02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:53.600]  85 billion a month to the fellow reserve they've already gutted the family they're already killing
[02:13:53.600 --> 02:13:58.640]  kids with their vaccines but they want it all now they want to kill christians and they don't
[02:13:58.640 --> 02:14:05.040]  want to wait and i'm telling you that's what it comes down to go ahead sir i actually had a dream
[02:14:05.040 --> 02:14:10.160]  about a nuke an offshore nuke on the usa so it's funny that you say something like that
[02:14:10.160 --> 02:14:16.080]  look if you get a chance you got to check out a youtube video uh called the coming alien savior
[02:14:16.080 --> 02:14:22.080]  deception with sid roth and tom horn and chris putnam you'll learn that the catholic church the
[02:14:22.080 --> 02:14:27.200]  vatican have built a device and they're involved in something called the lucifer project they've
[02:14:27.200 --> 02:14:31.680]  been watching the heavens with the world's most powerful telescope more powerful than the hubble
[02:14:31.680 --> 02:14:35.600]  telescope now i know you've got you've got crim and you've got all these other guys and they're
[02:14:35.600 --> 02:14:40.800]  going to do blue beam it's declassified they've had a plan since the 60s to create holograms and
[02:14:40.800 --> 02:14:45.440]  show jesus return or aliens i don't know if they'll go with that but that's definitely
[02:14:45.440 --> 02:14:50.400]  i was asked by the esquire guy well if aliens invaded would you unify humanity you know because
[02:14:50.400 --> 02:14:53.920]  we can't ever get things done because you say don't trust the government yeah because it's a
[02:14:53.920 --> 02:14:59.920]  bad government go ahead yeah it was a great deception is coming on the world and the vatican
[02:14:59.920 --> 02:15:04.880]  is going to be involved the pope's going to be up there uh try to get the christians i mean the
[02:15:04.880 --> 02:15:08.800]  christians are going to be persecuted you and i are going to be persecuted because we're not going
[02:15:08.800 --> 02:15:15.360]  to accept the new gospel that the vatican try to force down our throat well whatever happens
[02:15:15.360 --> 02:15:18.720]  they're going after i mean but i mean what do you say about the homeland security report
[02:15:18.720 --> 02:15:24.240]  uh to the military saying all catholics are extremists with al-qaeda next to them and then
[02:15:24.240 --> 02:15:27.760]  evangelicals and a bunch of other groups i mean it's i think they're i think they're just going
[02:15:27.760 --> 02:15:31.680]  after everybody but but but i mean i i know that they've been doing that ecumenicalism at the
[02:15:31.680 --> 02:15:36.240]  vatican saying it emerged the religions and stuff it's it's freaked a lot of catholics out too
[02:15:36.240 --> 02:15:41.120]  it's just really crazy times folks these are social engineers i appreciate your call and if
[02:15:41.120 --> 02:15:45.680]  they ask for a million miles and only get a half a million they still win you see that's why they're
[02:15:45.680 --> 02:15:52.560]  just going for everything and going we didn't buy 2700 and then 7 000 more armored anti-mine tanks

[02:25:20.240 --> 02:25:26.720]  vehicles uh the billions of bullets and then the trying to deny them because i saw your piece it
[02:25:26.720 --> 02:25:34.320]  was so dead on what do you make of that since tonight you were on piers morgan what was one of
[02:25:35.120 --> 02:25:42.560]  the greatest moments in television history i mean it was if we could have put a plathysmograph
[02:25:42.560 --> 02:25:50.480]  an internal body cavity monitor mr morgan it was just beautiful i'm still reeling from that so i
[02:25:50.480 --> 02:25:55.280]  haven't spoken from you since then and how they got everything going and and it's such an honor
[02:25:55.280 --> 02:26:01.200]  to be back on this incredible show let me tell you what happened alex i didn't uncover anything
[02:26:01.920 --> 02:26:07.680]  i'm asking questions i have two websites if i could just give one site that's all i want
[02:26:07.680 --> 02:26:11.520]  to give absolutely give them both out yeah yeah go and hear the questions that i did and i put
[02:26:11.520 --> 02:26:25.040]  two videos together just go to pix 11.com slash mo pix 11.com slash mo two videos february 21st
[02:26:25.920 --> 02:26:34.080]  march the 18th all i did was ask the following questions what is this what's going on now a
[02:26:34.080 --> 02:26:39.520]  couple of things first one of the things that we have noticed and i have noticed and you probably
[02:26:39.520 --> 02:26:43.520]  as well whenever you talk about the second amendment and i am not a second amendment
[02:26:43.520 --> 02:26:49.520]  advocate second amendment fan i'm a bill of rights fan i'm a constitution fan this is the
[02:26:49.520 --> 02:26:54.880]  only government the only country that has a rule book and a set of rules if you ask a frenchman or
[02:26:54.880 --> 02:26:58.480]  an italian what do you have to do to be a frenchman i don't know if you say what do you
[02:26:58.480 --> 02:27:04.480]  have to do to be an american you follow right here this the constitution this is not just
[02:27:04.480 --> 02:27:12.400]  it's it's not a suggestion it's the rules okay so the question of the second amendment is what is
[02:27:12.400 --> 02:27:16.720]  it for now i don't want to go through this you know this but when you when people talk they'll
[02:27:16.720 --> 02:27:23.200]  say look the second amendment never really imply or never intended for any kind of assault weapons
[02:27:23.200 --> 02:27:29.040]  on your part number one and the answer is oh yes it did read tench cox incredible founding fathers
[02:27:29.040 --> 02:27:34.800]  read his words you will not believe it it was precisely put in there as you know second amendment
[02:27:34.800 --> 02:27:38.400]  was not about camping or fishing or hunting or target practice or even self-protection it was
[02:27:38.400 --> 02:27:44.560]  about and you know the story this protection of you an inherent ability to protect yourself
[02:27:44.560 --> 02:27:52.640]  whether it's from rogue governments rebellion maybe maybe wandering rogue who knows bombers
[02:27:52.640 --> 02:27:58.240]  walking through streets locking down boston it could be a variety of things and normally when
[02:27:58.240 --> 02:28:02.240]  you're able to protect yourself when you want to protect yourself and your family you need the best
[02:28:02.960 --> 02:28:09.440]  arms available at your suggestion and you're based on your desire not some laundry list all right
[02:28:09.440 --> 02:28:14.880]  that being said because as a prosecutor you know we're not criminals unless we've been indicted
[02:28:14.880 --> 02:28:20.640]  and then adjudicated and proven why why can we not be trusted to have guns but then government
[02:28:20.640 --> 02:28:24.480]  can and then we know criminals aren't going to follow the law so they're going to have guns
[02:28:24.480 --> 02:28:29.200]  again this is just common sense and you can see both the videos at pix11.com
[02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:34.960]  forward slash ammo let me ask you this question we we've got both the videos and coming back i
[02:28:34.960 --> 02:28:40.000]  want to play some of them which one do you think we should play the first one february 21st this
[02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:44.240]  this is the first all i deal with ask a question and then what's critical about these videos is
[02:28:44.240 --> 02:28:51.520]  this people will say what are you talking about role with government whatever made you either
[02:28:51.520 --> 02:28:58.480]  distrust or think for a moment that the government could somehow get out of hand almost like a
[02:28:58.480 --> 02:29:05.600]  metastatic cancer that it could turn especially domestic now good luck explaining posse comitatus
[02:29:05.600 --> 02:29:10.800]  good luck explaining this firewall this constitutional firewall between domestic
[02:29:11.360 --> 02:29:16.880]  you know law enforcement and military good luck i try all the time and you can hear the snoring
[02:29:16.880 --> 02:29:22.160]  so i said i asked a question either one of two things are happening number one when you look at
[02:29:22.160 --> 02:29:26.480]  the basics and you've spelled it out in others when you look at the amount of bullets hollow
[02:29:26.480 --> 02:29:31.840]  point which by the way are not even using the rules of war because contrary to people's beliefs
[02:29:31.840 --> 02:29:36.640]  when you in war you want to use either ball ammo or full metal jacket you don't want to you want
[02:29:36.640 --> 02:29:40.320]  to wound you want to stay there explain that when we come back and by the way there's a mainstream
[02:29:40.320 --> 02:29:46.000]  news article today out about police being taught military tactics of fighting insurgents and they're
[02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:51.520]  being taught the american people are now insurgents we'll be right back with liner on the march
[02:29:51.520 --> 02:29:56.800]  the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[02:33:45.120 --> 02:33:48.800]  texas command center in the heart of the resistance
[02:33:52.960 --> 02:33:56.880]  i told you a year ago the ad still runs that we were about to go to the next level
[02:33:57.680 --> 02:34:03.360]  i have studied history i know how to beat these people they know that i know how to beat them and
[02:34:03.360 --> 02:34:09.680]  i i've read hundreds of military history books hundreds of propaganda books the truth is the
[02:34:09.680 --> 02:34:14.400]  ultimate weapon i know their program i know their plan does that mean i have the energy or even the
[02:34:14.400 --> 02:34:20.640]  intellect to do it all myself no i don't and there's nothing more frustrating than knowing
[02:34:20.640 --> 02:34:25.360]  there's an authoritarian criminal offshore takeover happening hundred percent up one side
[02:34:25.360 --> 02:34:30.400]  and down the other and people are like hey just join with it it knows what's best it just wants
[02:34:30.400 --> 02:34:36.640]  stability no it doesn't it's cold-blooded and hates this country because america stood for
[02:34:36.640 --> 02:34:41.120]  liberty hadn't been perfect but you look at the messages in our media it demonizes everything that
[02:34:41.120 --> 02:34:48.960]  we know is good i mean my god the the the the the homeland security lobbying and now the military
[02:34:48.960 --> 02:34:53.520]  being taught christians period or terrorist next to al-qaeda and then saying you will not talk
[02:34:53.520 --> 02:34:58.160]  about your religion to anybody or you'll be court-martialed that's official the first
[02:34:58.160 --> 02:35:03.520]  amendment says you can't as a government make people worship but you can't stop anybody for
[02:35:03.520 --> 02:35:10.640]  being an atheist a christian being jewish muslim agnostic animist and they can talk about what
[02:35:10.640 --> 02:35:15.280]  what we know what they want with people when they're out on duty and things now they're not
[02:35:15.280 --> 02:35:20.080]  even saying proselytizing now they're saying you don't talk about it ladies and gentlemen this is
[02:35:20.080 --> 02:35:25.680]  insane and i'm already digressing linalmedia.com by the way i haven't even talked about this
[02:35:25.680 --> 02:35:32.320]  because it happened when i was on the road george jones who i love you know died he died like last
[02:35:32.320 --> 02:35:38.480]  friday and uh linal has commentary on him he actually knew the possum old possum the great
[02:35:38.480 --> 02:35:46.960]  supreme possum and uh i love george jones and um he's dead and i think that man drank drank
[02:35:46.960 --> 02:35:52.240]  as much alcohol as willie nelson has smoked weed willie turned 80 just days after that i tweeted
[02:35:52.240 --> 02:35:57.200]  out some uh photos of willie and i and some of the anti-gunners were like there's no way you
[02:35:57.200 --> 02:36:02.800]  know him you liar you conspiracy there's that's photoshop you're right it doesn't exist linal
[02:36:02.800 --> 02:36:07.360]  you were getting the second amendment as a lawyer and as a newsman over there at pix 11 in new york
[02:36:07.360 --> 02:36:14.320]  and also of course uh on a big uh some of the biggest radio talk stations there as well and
[02:36:14.320 --> 02:36:21.840]  people can see those videos at pix.com forward slash uh ammo but looking at this i'm gonna talk
[02:36:21.840 --> 02:36:26.640]  about the response you got as well what do you make as a lawyer as a former top prosecutor in
[02:36:26.640 --> 02:36:31.840]  florida what do you make of it this tactic of stonewalling where they just keep saying it doesn't
[02:36:31.840 --> 02:36:35.760]  exist it doesn't exist it doesn't exist and then when they're caught that it does exist they go
[02:36:35.760 --> 02:36:41.200]  you're discredited it exists but it's not nefarious and then they stare and laugh at you who is that
[02:36:41.200 --> 02:36:45.760]  targeted at because it doesn't work on us and i don't think it works on anybody else either i
[02:36:45.760 --> 02:36:50.560]  think it's just mainly a way to never even acknowledge so we're busy just going hey you're
[02:36:50.560 --> 02:36:55.600]  lying instead of clapping the cuffs on them what do you make of all this what's interesting about
[02:36:55.600 --> 02:36:59.600]  this alex is first of all you have a number of people who for the first time in their lives
[02:36:59.600 --> 02:37:04.720]  are dealing with the notion of of weapons for the first time and you have to have some kind of
[02:37:04.720 --> 02:37:10.000]  rudimentary understanding in terms of the vernacular and names automatic versus semi-automatic
[02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:14.320]  and that sort of thing when you tell people this you can say let me see if i can bring this down
[02:37:14.320 --> 02:37:18.720]  for you and you've mentioned this as well when you talk about the amount of ammunition that is
[02:37:18.720 --> 02:37:24.480]  being by the way it's here it's going to artesia when it's in new mexico the federal uh training
[02:37:24.480 --> 02:37:32.160]  center but you haven't you have enough ammo hollow point which isn't even used in war by the way much
[02:37:32.160 --> 02:37:36.880]  more expensive so this notion of target practice is specious because it costs more money you don't
[02:37:36.880 --> 02:37:41.920]  waste money on that but we have two billion plus and this was in february god knows what the number
[02:37:41.920 --> 02:37:46.560]  is when i first mentioned this based upon the numbers of uh armed or bullets that were used in
[02:37:46.560 --> 02:37:51.360]  rounds that were used in fallujah and at the height of the iraq war about five and a half or so
[02:37:51.360 --> 02:37:59.040]  million rounds per month this is enough bullet enough rounds to to allow and to basically arm
[02:37:59.040 --> 02:38:04.960]  a continuous war for like 27 years so then when you say now all i'm doing is asking a question
[02:38:04.960 --> 02:38:11.200]  i'm just asking that's my middle name alex i'm just asking i'm just i'm stupid why does the
[02:38:11.200 --> 02:38:18.640]  social security administration or the marine fisheries want this amount of ammunition not
[02:38:18.640 --> 02:38:25.280]  only that forget the assault weapons and armored vehicles why one of two things a stupid person
[02:38:25.280 --> 02:38:30.080]  may come up with them one the government knows something we don't know god forbid that ever
[02:38:30.080 --> 02:38:34.560]  happening maybe there's some kind of unrest that i wish we'd know about okay fine or two
[02:38:34.560 --> 02:38:40.560]  it's trying to buy up every hollow point bullet they're doing both and because they know they're
[02:38:40.560 --> 02:38:46.080]  going to collapse the economy and and so we know but they never want to have that debate they want
[02:38:46.080 --> 02:38:50.880]  us to be caught flat footage so but but here's the thing this is the most important when you
[02:38:50.880 --> 02:38:57.200]  talk to people and you use as a basis for your you are saying and i say that the rudiments of
[02:38:57.200 --> 02:39:03.360]  the second amendment is this protection remember and and hell it was a case that basically
[02:39:03.360 --> 02:39:08.640]  established it as a right of view to possess a firearm but even prior to that it dealt with
[02:39:08.640 --> 02:39:13.280]  assault weapons again to prevent a royal government or insurrection or rebellion what have you
[02:39:13.280 --> 02:39:18.400]  absolutely it's not there for easter bunny hunting exactly it's not for hunting it's not for camping
[02:39:18.400 --> 02:39:22.720]  and it's not for even self-protection but when somebody asks the question wait a minute
[02:39:22.720 --> 02:39:29.040]  what would ever make you think that this great country that we love it's not the country it's
[02:39:29.040 --> 02:39:33.760]  governments in charge people who stand behind the aegis of you know the government that our great
[02:39:33.760 --> 02:39:39.040]  seal but what would ever make you think that and i would say you know to the untrained i somebody
[02:39:39.040 --> 02:39:44.000]  who dared really was a quote conspiracy theorist which is my favorite don't forget what gore vidal
[02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:50.960]  said i'm not a conspiracy theorist i'm a conspiracy analyst so what happens was you would say it would
[02:39:50.960 --> 02:39:57.600]  lead one to think something is up now when you come home as an analogy and you're late and your
[02:39:57.600 --> 02:40:03.680]  wife says where are you where were you and you say none of your business going to bed you have
[02:40:03.680 --> 02:40:10.720]  just created the controversy you might be a church but you've got lipstick lipstick on your face and
[02:40:10.720 --> 02:40:17.600]  your zippers down among the other accoutrement of adallions now so that's that the next thing
[02:40:17.600 --> 02:40:24.160]  people have to understand is this much the second amendment by the way the the anti-second amendment
[02:40:24.160 --> 02:40:30.800]  wing oh i've got it i've got to mention this on april the 15th the boston marathon isn't it amazing
[02:40:31.440 --> 02:40:40.480]  how this group of marionettes went out almost in q saying this these people have to be right
[02:40:40.480 --> 02:40:45.520]  wing by the way i'm neither right or left you know and i know the left right paradigm is an illusion
[02:40:45.520 --> 02:40:49.120]  but exactly but day one they're saying it's going to be right wingers and then the guys they
[02:40:49.120 --> 02:40:53.440]  supposedly catch they act like they want dead and they have intelligence agency connections and
[02:40:53.440 --> 02:40:58.320]  there's a drill and then they have martial law in the city pointing guns saying come out of your
[02:40:58.320 --> 02:41:03.440]  house and then we're not supposed to say that's martial law linal please but i i did another video
[02:41:03.440 --> 02:41:08.800]  called what does martial law look like you see one of the things that people forget and and it's
[02:41:08.800 --> 02:41:14.640]  one of the worst things that we as a civilization as a great country suffer from is this notion of
[02:41:14.640 --> 02:41:18.800]  american exceptionalism you know we look at other countries and we say that can't happen here when
[02:41:18.800 --> 02:41:23.760]  you see banks implode when you see bank runs when you see riots and people burning things in greece
[02:41:23.760 --> 02:41:30.720]  or that can't happen here things are great the dow hit 15 000 hey everything's terrific the moment
[02:41:30.720 --> 02:41:35.680]  you think that that's the problem so now we look at this let me also say something before i forget
[02:41:35.680 --> 02:41:40.240]  and you've mentioned this so many times i have screamed wanting to talk to you about this do you
[02:41:40.240 --> 02:41:47.200]  know that when i prosecuted the part of all the divisions misdemeanor traffic felony homicide
[02:41:48.720 --> 02:41:55.920]  the department the area that made me lose sleep at night was juvenile i saw something 30 years ago
[02:41:55.920 --> 02:42:02.320]  of children being taken away from parents which led to this and i knew this bear with me
[02:42:02.320 --> 02:42:07.280]  what's interesting about governments it could be any government is that you never do something you
[02:42:07.280 --> 02:42:13.200]  never attack head-on you basically accomplish what you want using a different fiction or a different
[02:42:13.200 --> 02:42:17.760]  mechanism to exactly they'll say it's one thing but it's really another and you're talking about
[02:42:17.760 --> 02:42:22.800]  them going after this hunger to get kids because then federal funds kick in then they can sell them
[02:42:22.800 --> 02:42:29.680]  to the adoption agency and it really is a form of of child kidnapping but uh is that why you got
[02:42:29.680 --> 02:42:33.520]  out of prosecuting because i think you mentioned some of this to me in private what happened was
[02:42:33.520 --> 02:42:37.680]  for example they started to take kids away and all of a sudden they said you alex jones
[02:42:37.680 --> 02:42:43.040]  are on the child abuse watch list or whatever it was we called it the hit parade and you would say
[02:42:43.040 --> 02:42:47.680]  well how do i get off it don't know it's not a conviction this is our administrative yeah but
[02:42:47.680 --> 02:42:52.880]  it's on forever how do i i was wrongfully i'm sorry you're on you're you're stuck okay next
[02:42:52.880 --> 02:42:58.640]  jump to the future terror watch list terror watch this i one time interviewed the mother of a kidney
[02:42:58.640 --> 02:43:03.280]  the mother of a kidney by joseph smith and we're not talking the mormons but joseph douglas or
[02:43:03.280 --> 02:43:09.680]  something ken was eight years old and kent we're on this list you can't get off the list how did
[02:43:09.680 --> 02:43:15.680]  i get on the list sorry you're tough you're out next weapons we're not gonna go on just take your
[02:43:15.680 --> 02:43:20.800]  guns we'll put you on a list and what happens is you're seeing this more and more and more
[02:43:20.800 --> 02:43:25.280]  you're seeing this watch list the same way alex and this is another thing i don't want to bore
[02:43:25.280 --> 02:43:32.320]  people but these people are very clever rather than pass legislation and go through the usual
[02:43:32.320 --> 02:43:37.120]  you know the troika you know this balance of power separation of powers the president now
[02:43:37.120 --> 02:43:43.280]  through the unitary executive comes up with things like pdds and executive uh uh orders and uh you
[02:43:43.280 --> 02:43:48.560]  name it all different types of and it all circumvents in the bureaucracy and it's totally
[02:43:48.560 --> 02:43:53.680]  of illegal look at this article democrats move to exploit terror watch list in new attack on
[02:43:53.680 --> 02:43:58.400]  second amendment they've said for five years their plan now they're saying we don't even need a bill
[02:43:58.400 --> 02:44:04.880]  now we'll just put you on a list and say you can't own a gun and say why not just like the terror
[02:44:04.880 --> 02:44:10.400]  watch list or if you're on the list you then can't own guns i mean that is the definition
[02:44:10.960 --> 02:44:16.240]  of a tyranny and you have military on the streets and people disappearing you're in a hot martial
[02:44:16.240 --> 02:44:26.960]  law listen alex i'm in new york you i there was a time you know we stop and frisk like 300,000
[02:44:26.960 --> 02:44:30.800]  times a year yeah it's incredible i think we had this is a great this is a great bone of
[02:44:30.800 --> 02:44:36.400]  attention you you know that in new york every square inch every square inch is under surveillance
[02:44:36.400 --> 02:44:40.080]  like you cannot believe let me tell you something else i mentioned this for you the last time i
[02:44:40.080 --> 02:44:45.520]  spoke with you my dream one day if i if you said you want to be in government i said yes i want
[02:44:45.520 --> 02:44:52.480]  to be in a new position created for me it's called psychologist general not a general psychologist
[02:44:52.480 --> 02:44:58.560]  what i want to do is i want to create the memes and the collective psychology macro psychology
[02:44:58.560 --> 02:45:03.520]  if you will other people what happens is as you know one of the one of the doctrines is an old
[02:45:03.520 --> 02:45:07.840]  psych major myself is habituation you put on a watch you wear it it's heavy at first next thing
[02:45:07.840 --> 02:45:13.600]  you know the novel stimuli are not novel anymore when you are ground down when you it's learn
[02:45:13.600 --> 02:45:18.800]  helplessness when you become as we say i use a word all the time in sheeple when you you know
[02:45:18.800 --> 02:45:23.280]  there's expressions like trying to herd cats that's what they're doing they are training us
[02:45:23.280 --> 02:45:29.360]  to be prisoners what happens is you are being habituated you were told everything from sugary
[02:45:29.360 --> 02:45:35.840]  drinks to trans fast to sodium to the amount the size of cups little kids now and there was a school
[02:45:35.840 --> 02:45:40.800]  i read today where they were pulling them out based upon their bmi pulling them out of school
[02:45:40.800 --> 02:45:46.240]  corralling them pointing at them humiliating to call them no no they're training you that you
[02:45:46.240 --> 02:45:51.680]  have no space that you're bad that you're a suspect that you're evil and the state and the
[02:45:51.680 --> 02:45:58.000]  gangs of bureaucrats they're the new class they're re-establishing a class system through a government
[02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:04.160]  and corporate structure it's unbelievable and then getting gangs together in the new economy
[02:46:04.160 --> 02:46:09.920]  that will feed off of you who were taught that's how they make a living we're going into the prison
[02:46:09.920 --> 02:46:15.600]  hell economy it's funny you say that also look back one of the classic experiments the milgram
[02:46:15.600 --> 02:46:21.120]  experiment it was it was it was at the time when eichmann was on trial and people asked how could
[02:46:21.120 --> 02:46:26.720]  how could these people do this how could people during nazi germany by the way i don't want to be
[02:46:26.720 --> 02:46:33.840]  a godwin you know theory uh violator here but but you you you have to look at history how do
[02:46:34.720 --> 02:46:39.440]  people in i mean listen germany was the height of civilization how do they kill people in death
[02:46:39.440 --> 02:46:44.080]  panels now how do they how do they now say kill babies up to age three because they found the
[02:46:44.080 --> 02:46:49.040]  milgram experiment in 1961 and in several universities in similar studies they found
[02:46:49.040 --> 02:46:53.200]  over 90 percent of people right the stanford prison came later on so what i'm trying to say
[02:46:53.200 --> 02:46:58.560]  they would kill well tell people what they would do well the milgram experiment was basically it
[02:46:58.560 --> 02:47:02.640]  was at yale and what happened was they they took people off the street and said we'll give you a
[02:47:02.640 --> 02:47:07.520]  few bucks if you could be a part of a science experiment and people came in the guy with a
[02:47:07.520 --> 02:47:12.400]  white coat came in they said there was a person behind they did it for four dollars four dollars
[02:47:12.400 --> 02:47:16.320]  they would kill people guys type in milgram experiments on wikipedia i want to show them
[02:47:16.320 --> 02:47:21.120]  the actual documents go ahead but what happens is they said now listen this is this is for science
[02:47:21.120 --> 02:47:27.760]  remember give me a higher order terrorism science uh freedom whatever you whatever your goal is and
[02:47:27.760 --> 02:47:32.160]  what we want you to do is these people have got an answer wrong we want you to give them a shock
[02:47:32.160 --> 02:47:38.640]  of electricity and increase the severity of the electricity as they get answers wrong alex it got
[02:47:38.640 --> 02:47:44.640]  so bad of course nobody was actually hurt but the experimenter who was hired to do this didn't know
[02:47:44.640 --> 02:47:52.800]  this it got so bad that people were screaming and then stopped either they were in a coma or dead
[02:47:52.800 --> 02:47:59.360]  as far as this person knew and he kept shocking them because an authority figure told them to do
[02:47:59.360 --> 02:48:08.000]  it the body precisely and it was for a greater good i could suspend my no no we went out and
[02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:12.960]  did things where we said we're going to bring nazi rule to america for the good and to get the guns
[02:48:12.960 --> 02:48:20.080]  and most californians signed it you know we said nazi orwellian rule this is a petition for nazis
[02:48:20.080 --> 02:48:26.080]  to run america and they signed it you you said the great dihydrogen monoxide routine years ago
[02:48:26.080 --> 02:48:31.680]  there was an apocryphal of story from my native state of florida where george smathers was running
[02:48:31.680 --> 02:48:36.480]  against claud pepper they called him red pepper and then the panhandle they say it didn't happen
[02:48:36.480 --> 02:48:42.160]  but i kind of like the story george smathers supposedly said in the southern draw did you know
[02:48:43.120 --> 02:48:51.440]  that claud pepper's sister is a thespian and she mutulates and she's what they didn't know
[02:48:51.440 --> 02:48:57.280]  these poor panhandle florida the point is you can gauge anything now let me stop for a second
[02:48:57.280 --> 02:49:04.400]  what is and and and that wasn't even lobler slander because she was an actress yeah right
[02:49:04.400 --> 02:49:12.080]  in new york you know even worse so here's the bottom he's a thespian well now that is in new
[02:49:12.080 --> 02:49:19.040]  york here is the best one gorbital whom i i love more and more now thank god for youtube said that
[02:49:19.040 --> 02:49:24.640]  it is an article of faith an actual article of faith to live in this country that you must deny
[02:49:24.640 --> 02:49:31.040]  any conspiracy theories and here is the most beautiful word in the world and i love the way
[02:49:31.040 --> 02:49:36.720]  somebody appropriated this alex there are people in federal prison doing life sentences on
[02:49:36.720 --> 02:49:41.440]  conspiracy conspiracies are the confederation between two guilty people to bring something
[02:49:41.440 --> 02:49:45.840]  about if you act alone you can't conspire with yourself and you can't conspire with a cop
[02:49:45.840 --> 02:49:50.880]  too and conspiracy's bad because it shows it's ultra premeditated but what happens yes it means
[02:49:50.880 --> 02:49:56.560]  it's coordinated it's confederated it's conspired but what it means also in today's vernacular and
[02:49:56.560 --> 02:50:04.480]  our lexicon the neologism means you're insane you're exactly so if you say powerful groups
[02:50:04.480 --> 02:50:09.520]  ever conspire which is the whole history of man it doesn't exist i mean that the devil's greatest
[02:50:09.520 --> 02:50:13.520]  trick is he doesn't exist and they've got the public convinced part of them that there's no
[02:50:13.520 --> 02:50:20.400]  government corruption and recently this is interesting hey remember left or right fox
[02:50:20.400 --> 02:50:24.480]  msdnc doesn't really matter whoever's the president they just switch partners remember
[02:50:24.480 --> 02:50:29.200]  the people right now the the loudest civil libertarians are in fox because obama's in power
[02:50:29.200 --> 02:50:33.280]  when bush was doing the patriot act it was the opposite so it doesn't really matter
[02:50:33.280 --> 02:50:37.600]  it's like stephen still saying change partners but what's happening right now is we're seeing
[02:50:37.600 --> 02:50:42.880]  these words used interchangeably to stop thinking and to let you know and make you think maybe
[02:50:42.880 --> 02:50:46.480]  something hey line let me stop you we got to go to break i'm going to come back and do something
[02:50:46.480 --> 02:50:50.560]  special and then and then maybe have you do five minutes with david knight is going to take over

[02:54:37.440 --> 02:54:42.880]  watching at info wars.com forward slash listen some of what i'm talking about i'm in hot springs
[02:54:42.880 --> 02:54:47.200]  arkansas i wasn't gonna come up here for like three days one of my children got sick on the
[02:54:47.200 --> 02:54:51.680]  drive up and so we didn't really get any vacation i thought why not just broadcast from here and
[02:54:51.680 --> 02:54:55.920]  you'll be able to exercise and spend time with the family it's a great town just since i came
[02:54:55.920 --> 02:55:02.000]  here when i was a child most of it shut down and rotting uh and uh almost all the small businesses
[02:55:02.000 --> 02:55:05.840]  have shut down and they say it's because the economy tourism just isn't like it was the
[02:55:05.840 --> 02:55:12.000]  arlington is an old great hotel built almost 100 years ago i am in the al capone suite al capone
[02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:16.480]  they had national baseball camp here uh they it was one of the biggest gambling centers in the
[02:55:16.480 --> 02:55:22.160]  country as well uh and al capone lived here about three to six months out of the year where i'm
[02:55:22.160 --> 02:55:28.720]  sitting uh the arlington hotel great place to visit folks while it's still here uh the arlington
[02:55:28.720 --> 02:55:37.600]  hotel uh is very historical and they lent us the last few days uh the uh the um the al capone suite
[02:55:37.600 --> 02:55:41.760]  and didn't even say we had to plug them but i am plugging the arlington hotel uh again there's a
[02:55:41.760 --> 02:55:46.880]  lot of nice restaurants a lot of art here a lot of really nice people but you see most of the
[02:55:46.880 --> 02:55:52.880]  buildings are empty uh now and so it's a piece of american history with the ozark mountains and hot
[02:55:52.880 --> 02:55:58.480]  volcanic water that comes out in the baths it's very well known to have uh with the native
[02:55:58.480 --> 02:56:04.320]  americans and the national baseball league you name it they have healing effects and i'm showing
[02:56:04.320 --> 02:56:09.520]  tv viewers a shot out of al capone's window he picked this here on the fourth floor out on the
[02:56:09.520 --> 02:56:14.320]  edge it's an 11 story building so that he could stake out and watch you know what was coming in
[02:56:14.320 --> 02:56:20.000]  and out of the hotel so this is where he tended to hang out even more sometimes than chicago and
[02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:27.280]  right there that building is was the first model in superman uh able to jump a building in a single
[02:56:27.280 --> 02:56:32.720]  bound and my five-year-old thought it was the vampire states building so that's a very very
[02:56:32.720 --> 02:56:38.480]  famous town hot springs arkansas and government's not going to be able to revive it people need to
[02:56:38.480 --> 02:56:44.480]  revive it and revive small towns and shop locally as much as you can globalism is what is destroying
[02:56:44.480 --> 02:56:48.640]  this country this is about as picturesque and as good a place you could live in the country just
[02:56:48.640 --> 02:56:54.160]  tropical plants everywhere it's like a rainforest uh here and i thought i would uh give you a review
[02:56:54.160 --> 02:56:58.960]  of some of that in fact richard maybe go shoot the army navy uh rehabilitation center some of
[02:56:58.960 --> 02:57:04.800]  it's still open uh down there you just other gothic or not even gothic you call them art deco
[02:57:04.800 --> 02:57:10.640]  buildings built in the 20s and 30s most of them i'm a very historic place i'm leaving right now
[02:57:10.640 --> 02:57:14.880]  so nobody needs to come to the hotel folks i'll be gone in five minutes i'm walking out right now
[02:57:14.880 --> 02:57:18.720]  it takes five minutes to break this down i've probably had 15 groups of people figure out where
[02:57:18.720 --> 02:57:22.720]  i met and be sitting waiting for me in the bar again to show you how big the show is i'm not
[02:57:22.720 --> 02:57:28.160]  bragging no brag just fact i'm saying that shows we're waking people up i walk down the street
[02:57:28.160 --> 02:57:33.360]  every fifth person comes over here it's all over the country like this we have strength
[02:57:33.360 --> 02:57:37.280]  we're a lot bigger than the globalists will admit and no matter what they do to me they can
[02:57:37.280 --> 02:57:41.600]  politically destroy me destroy my name whatever except they're so discredited they can't it's kind
[02:57:41.600 --> 02:57:46.800]  of freaking them out they can physically kill me or set me up but the idea goes forward there's so
[02:57:46.800 --> 02:57:53.360]  many innocents being persecuted and hurt by these people right now we have a responsibility
[02:57:54.640 --> 02:57:59.520]  to continue to fight against this global mafia and of course al capone was a lower level mafia
[02:57:59.520 --> 02:58:04.800]  who stepped on the rockefeller toes and ran arkansas so they sent winthrop in winthrop
[02:58:04.800 --> 02:58:09.360]  to take it over and shut it down and monopolize it like west virginia but there's old al capone
[02:58:09.360 --> 02:58:13.120]  and i'm sitting right where his desk was this is just how it was when he was here it's a different
[02:58:13.120 --> 02:58:18.240]  desk they got all the photos of him so i'm sitting where al capone would hang out and it's pretty
[02:58:18.240 --> 02:58:23.120]  amazing the fourth hour is coming up some stations carry it if they don't we'll see you back tomorrow

[03:00:27.520 --> 03:00:32.000]  sitting up for him for this uh last hour of overdrive and we've got on the phone
[03:00:32.000 --> 03:00:35.680]  lionel who alex is just talking to and he's going to talk to us a little bit more about this
[03:00:35.680 --> 03:00:41.440]  ammunition ammunition situation that's going on lionel you're still there david i'm here sir it's
[03:00:41.440 --> 03:00:46.320]  a pleasure pleasure talking to you uh you know when you were talking about uh the ammunition
[03:00:46.320 --> 03:00:51.520]  stuff and uh you brought up the milgram experiment you know there was that french tv show just a
[03:00:51.520 --> 03:00:56.640]  couple of years ago called the game of death are you familiar with that um vaguely yeah they they
[03:00:56.640 --> 03:01:01.840]  did it as a documentary and they found that 82 percent of the people that they brought in they
[03:01:01.840 --> 03:01:06.240]  basically had actors they they had a real elaborate game show where they replicated
[03:01:06.240 --> 03:01:11.920]  the milgram experiment they found that 82 percent of the people were willing to pull that lever
[03:01:11.920 --> 03:01:17.600]  and again it's just an appeal to authority uh same sort of thing you know we look at this and
[03:01:17.600 --> 03:01:23.520]  we we question why people in the media are not asking questions whether it's about the boston
[03:01:23.520 --> 03:01:28.720]  bombing not questioning details there they're not questioning details about the bullets and we
[03:01:28.720 --> 03:01:33.920]  wonder what's going on with that and they're not necessarily been taken into some secret conspiracy
[03:01:33.920 --> 03:01:38.880]  a lot of this is as alex had mentioned they just want to be liked by the authorities they want to
[03:01:38.880 --> 03:01:44.560]  be uh you know given given nice uh pats on the back and uh say you can come to the next press
[03:01:44.560 --> 03:01:48.240]  conference and we'll give you a question it's one of the things which is the most fascinating you
[03:01:48.240 --> 03:01:56.320]  know i i never cease to be fascinated david by by human emotion and and and psychology if you will
[03:01:56.320 --> 03:02:01.600]  and psychopathology and and how we're nuts in essence you know one of the things that's
[03:02:01.600 --> 03:02:07.520]  interesting is that we as as humans believe that we're different from animals that we have lost
[03:02:07.520 --> 03:02:11.600]  the idea of of i hope you can't hear this yapping dog somewhere i'm gonna i'm gonna
[03:02:11.600 --> 03:02:18.560]  do something criminal anyway but but we as animals have this this cortex we basically have
[03:02:18.560 --> 03:02:23.920]  mammalian brains but what makes us different is this cortex there's this thinking and emotion and
[03:02:23.920 --> 03:02:29.360]  and cognition and planning and and we think we're above everything but there's a part of us that's
[03:02:29.360 --> 03:02:35.920]  very very base the word there is animalistic and and one of the things that we do like other
[03:02:35.920 --> 03:02:45.040]  animals is that we habituate you know there's a balance you david have to get along and yet be
[03:02:45.040 --> 03:02:52.160]  bold and there's a balance if you constantly fought the system things would not work out well
[03:02:52.160 --> 03:02:57.040]  for you you cannot run red light you cannot show a blade to work you know there's order so we kind
[03:02:57.040 --> 03:03:04.800]  of submit but in our minds we say okay that makes sense here's the part that gets me when you see
[03:03:04.800 --> 03:03:11.760]  when you see a terrorist somebody that we've identified translation somebody else right wing
[03:03:11.760 --> 03:03:17.680]  fundamentalist somebody else somebody else it's the other guy when they do something and we say
[03:03:17.680 --> 03:03:24.720]  they're evil i don't think there has ever been anybody on this planet behind a cause who said
[03:03:24.720 --> 03:03:30.000]  we're evil even the famous berserkers i don't think they said we're evil want to join our
[03:03:30.000 --> 03:03:38.800]  force we're evil they say we are right and this target whoever they are they're wrong they're
[03:03:38.800 --> 03:03:43.360]  evil in their own mind and both sides and they will be able to justify it one way or the other
[03:03:43.360 --> 03:03:48.880]  so humans must be possessed by the idea that what they're doing is right number two when they're
[03:03:49.600 --> 03:03:56.960]  scared if you want to scare somebody and you pose the idea of of terrorism or crime or drugs or
[03:03:56.960 --> 03:04:01.360]  whatever it is people will do anything they will also give up things another thing which is
[03:04:01.360 --> 03:04:09.600]  interesting which is another aspect david which i find so amazing we need to re-instruct people
[03:04:09.600 --> 03:04:14.960]  on what the government is and isn't the government is not the washington monument
[03:04:14.960 --> 03:04:21.040]  enabling it in the congress and you know old glory and the government today are people who
[03:04:21.040 --> 03:04:27.440]  hide behind the aegis the firewall of of our beloved country give me an example i think
[03:04:28.240 --> 03:04:33.280]  unions are a wonderful thing now they're subject to abuse but the idea of the union
[03:04:33.280 --> 03:04:39.360]  with a child labor union gave us 40-hour work week union very very good collective bargaining now
[03:04:40.400 --> 03:04:47.760]  to the person who saw the teamsters perhaps become corrupted they said unions are bad no they're not
[03:04:47.760 --> 03:04:51.920]  these people are bad governments are kind of like that right they have to keep an eye on them

[03:08:29.280 --> 03:08:34.000]  there and see some of his analysis and one of the things i liked that lionel said when he was talking
[03:08:34.000 --> 03:08:41.600]  to alex was that we're not conspiracy theorists we're conspiracy analysts uh you know we don't
[03:08:41.600 --> 03:08:46.720]  have theories we've got some facts that we want to analyze here and back on this last weekend
[03:08:46.720 --> 03:08:51.840]  rolling stones put out an article it was uh everything is rigged the biggest price fixing
[03:08:51.840 --> 03:08:57.280]  scandal ever and they said the illuminatis were amateurs the second huge financial scandal of the
[03:08:57.280 --> 03:09:03.120]  year reveals the real international conspiracy that there is no price that big banks can't fix
[03:09:03.840 --> 03:09:09.200]  and they apologize to conspiracy theorists about that and uh one of the things that they're
[03:09:09.200 --> 03:09:15.280]  pointing out is as you may remember about a year ago we had the libor scandal which was gigantic
[03:09:15.280 --> 03:09:20.400]  uh it was three between three and sixteen banks that were manipulating global interest rates if
[03:09:20.400 --> 03:09:25.840]  you ever get a variable rate interest loan you'll see that it is tied to the libor index and that is
[03:09:25.840 --> 03:09:32.640]  supposed to be a free market index but these two large banks were colluding together to fix that
[03:09:32.640 --> 03:09:37.920]  interest rate to their advantage now we've got another scandal that's breaking and this one
[03:09:37.920 --> 03:09:43.280]  centers around an organization of brokers in london at a firm called uh or an organization
[03:09:43.280 --> 03:09:50.560]  called icap i-c-a-p and it also now includes about 15 of the world's largest banks the same usual
[03:09:50.560 --> 03:09:59.920]  suspects and they are also fixing interest rate rate swaps to their advantage this involves 379
[03:09:59.920 --> 03:10:06.960]  trillion dollars which is 100 times the size of the u.s government's budget this is a gigantic
[03:10:06.960 --> 03:10:13.520]  amount of money and when we were speculating about you know why is the uh homeland security buying
[03:10:13.520 --> 03:10:18.240]  up so much ammunition are they buying it to prepare for a civil war because they're expecting
[03:10:18.240 --> 03:10:23.360]  financial collapse or are they trying to dry up the supply of ammunition and as we believe it's
[03:10:23.360 --> 03:10:27.760]  a little bit of both but consider this this is out of the rolling stones article and you really need
[03:10:27.760 --> 03:10:33.280]  to see this article it's uh about eight or nine pages printed out listen to this two of america's
[03:10:33.280 --> 03:10:38.320]  top law enforcement officials attorney general eric holder and former justice department criminal
[03:10:38.320 --> 03:10:45.120]  division chief lanny brewer confessed that it is dangerous to prosecute offending banks because
[03:10:45.120 --> 03:10:51.120]  they are simply too big now listen to this quote from uh these guys making arrests they said might
[03:10:51.120 --> 03:10:58.560]  lead to quote collateral consequences unquote in the economy in other words eric holder and
[03:10:58.560 --> 03:11:04.160]  justice department criminal division chief lanny brewer are admitting that they're being that
[03:11:04.160 --> 03:11:09.120]  they're afraid of prosecuting criminal banks because they're afraid that they will tank
[03:11:09.120 --> 03:11:15.120]  the economy so think about that when you look at these gigantic ammo purchases and here's one
[03:11:15.120 --> 03:11:21.760]  other thing from the article they explain how this i-cap scandal is working and if you ever
[03:11:21.760 --> 03:11:27.360]  saw the movie the sting with robert redford and paul newman uh think back to that remember in
[03:11:27.360 --> 03:11:33.280]  that movie how and actually kind of use an analogy similar to that like a racetrack knowing knowing
[03:11:33.280 --> 03:11:37.600]  who's going to be the winner in a horse race a little bit before the winner is announced and
[03:11:37.600 --> 03:11:44.880]  if you remember that movie they basically set up a giant scam where they uh had a uh a bookie
[03:11:44.880 --> 03:11:50.960]  area where this uh fat daddy was going to make a very large bet and they were delaying the
[03:11:50.960 --> 03:11:55.440]  announcing of the race so basically they were listening in one spot delaying it and then
[03:11:55.440 --> 03:12:00.560]  announcing it a little bit later and they were able to know just a little bit in advance by
[03:12:00.560 --> 03:12:04.320]  delaying that maybe about five minutes they knew who the winner was going to be and they placed
[03:12:04.320 --> 03:12:08.720]  their bets accordingly and broke the other guy because he thought he was hearing it in real time
[03:12:08.720 --> 03:12:15.040]  that is essentially what these people at i-cap were doing they were delaying the data by just
[03:12:15.040 --> 03:12:20.800]  a little bit before it went out and placing their bets making money on these interest rate swaps
[03:12:20.800 --> 03:12:26.320]  so much so that these 20 or so brokers that are involved in this i-cap scandal they called the
[03:12:26.320 --> 03:12:32.320]  unit treasure island because they were making so much money now the question is will anything be
[03:12:32.320 --> 03:12:37.360]  done if eric holder and other people like that are afraid of the banks no probably not and they
[03:12:37.360 --> 03:12:43.520]  are going to get hundreds of trillions with a t hundreds of trillions of dollars of money and
[03:12:43.520 --> 03:12:48.960]  these scams and if we don't like it they just might crash the economy so that's another reason
[03:12:48.960 --> 03:12:54.480]  they may be stockpiling bullets now along the lines of gun control as we mentioned earlier
[03:12:54.480 --> 03:13:01.520]  obama has said that this is really just round one he said in mexico that last time they got
[03:13:01.520 --> 03:13:07.040]  significant gun control passed it took them six seven eight tries and the irony of this is that
[03:13:07.040 --> 03:13:14.080]  he's doing this in mexico and that he's talking about how our guns are the root cause of the crime
[03:13:14.080 --> 03:13:19.840]  of the crime in mexico and and that's nothing to uh to sneeze at what's going on in mexico
[03:13:20.400 --> 03:13:26.960]  they have far more people have have died in the drug wars in mexico than have died in afghanistan
[03:13:26.960 --> 03:13:31.920]  and so it's a tremendous amount of violence that's going on there and yet our attorney general was
[03:13:31.920 --> 03:13:37.200]  involved in illegal gun running scandal the fast and furious down there and now they're using that
[03:13:37.200 --> 03:13:44.560]  as a pretext as an excuse to take away our second amendment rights uh why isn't he locked up and
[03:13:44.560 --> 03:13:49.840]  what we saw in the run-up to the election we saw that uh some republicans did come after him
[03:13:50.560 --> 03:13:54.960]  why did they stop at the election well i think in my personal opinion they stopped because
[03:13:55.600 --> 03:14:00.480]  there are connections in this that go beyond eric holder that go beyond the obama administration
[03:14:00.480 --> 03:14:07.280]  these are there's a bureaucratic uh connection through the atf uh going back into previous
[03:14:07.280 --> 03:14:11.120]  administration of the bush administration so this is why the republicans in my opinion are not going
[03:14:11.120 --> 03:14:16.240]  to follow this through and lock eric holder up as they should they should at least uh get him
[03:14:16.240 --> 03:14:21.120]  out of office because he's a criminal attorney general and if you don't think that he's criminal
[03:14:21.120 --> 03:14:26.640]  and wrong uh because of fast and furious just look at what he did this last week and this is
[03:14:26.640 --> 03:14:30.880]  something that we didn't cover that didn't get much attention because this happened as the
[03:14:30.880 --> 03:14:36.960]  bombings were being investigated we've had a couple of houses house bills we had the ohio
[03:14:36.960 --> 03:14:43.520]  house as well as the missouri house have been working on bills that would nullify any
[03:14:43.520 --> 03:14:49.280]  unconstitutional gun control laws coming out of washington now we already had a similar bill pass
[03:14:49.280 --> 03:14:56.000]  in kansas and be signed into law and that bill went into effect april the 25th and attorney
[03:14:56.000 --> 03:15:01.360]  general eric holder the very next day after that went into effect sent the governor of kansas
[03:15:01.360 --> 03:15:07.520]  governor brownback a threatening letter saying that the kansas law quote-unquote purports that
[03:15:07.520 --> 03:15:12.400]  was eric holder's word that it purports to override federal law saying that under the
[03:15:12.400 --> 03:15:17.520]  supremacy clause of the constitution kansas cannot prevent federal employees and officials from
[03:15:17.520 --> 03:15:22.480]  carrying out their official responsibilities and a state certainly may not criminalize the exercise
[03:15:22.480 --> 03:15:28.880]  of federal responsibilities because that law had a provision that made it a felony
[03:15:28.880 --> 03:15:34.960]  for federal bureaucrats to come in and violate the constitution as it should be and so eric
[03:15:34.960 --> 03:15:39.360]  holder goes back and looks at the supremacy clause but what does the supremacy clause say
[03:15:39.360 --> 03:15:44.480]  well the supremacy clause says that the constitution and the laws of the united states
[03:15:44.480 --> 03:15:51.200]  which shall be made in pursuance thereof are the supreme law of the land so if you write a law that
[03:15:51.200 --> 03:15:59.760]  is not in pursuance of the clearly stated guidelines of the constitution then it is not a supremacy
[03:15:59.760 --> 03:16:04.800]  the supremacy clause cannot be invoked so we want to take some of your calls and see what you have
[03:16:04.800 --> 03:16:10.960]  to say about some of these things and let us know what you think about gun control about the giant
[03:16:10.960 --> 03:16:15.760]  bank failures and we'll also talk a little bit here about what's going on in the pentagon where
[03:16:15.760 --> 03:16:21.280]  it looks like they're purging christians out of the military let's go to our first call here we've
[03:16:21.280 --> 03:16:26.880]  got mark in colorado you've been holding on for a long time what have you got hi um yeah i just
[03:16:26.880 --> 03:16:31.360]  wanted to kind of talk about the same points you're making um the constitution seems fragile
[03:16:31.360 --> 03:16:38.080]  and the background of it i think um of its fall and just in general um is due to uh the pledge
[03:16:38.080 --> 03:16:43.200]  of allegiance actually i think um and just the main quality of that being the fact that we don't
[03:16:43.200 --> 03:16:48.240]  have that many unifying pledges between peoples and that was a cultural thing for us as well as
[03:16:48.240 --> 03:16:52.320]  other things anything you'll see in the news these days is all about separation it's all about really
[03:16:52.320 --> 03:16:55.920]  dividing us into tribes and trying to take us down like that well you know when you're talking about
[03:16:55.920 --> 03:17:00.480]  pledging allegiance to the flag what about the pledges that all of our elected officials take
[03:17:00.480 --> 03:17:06.080]  to uphold the constitution and defend it i mean you know how can they justify these infringements
[03:17:06.080 --> 03:17:09.680]  on the second amendment how can they justify these infringements on the first amendment that
[03:17:09.680 --> 03:17:15.360]  the pentagon is doing they're allowing that to happen that is a clear infringement upon people's
[03:17:15.360 --> 03:17:22.080]  first amendment rights you know that we have a freedom of religion not a freedom from religion
[03:17:22.080 --> 03:17:28.160]  and when they try to turn it into a freedom from religion they are impinging on people's freedom
[03:17:28.160 --> 03:17:32.720]  of speech as well as their freedom of religion i think that's why the founders wisely put both
[03:17:32.720 --> 03:17:36.240]  freedom of speech and freedom of religion in the same amendment because they really are
[03:17:36.240 --> 03:17:42.080]  two sides of the same coin definitely definitely and i think i think uh if i just had one message
[03:17:42.080 --> 03:17:45.440]  for like teachers and just everyone in general if you want to say the pledge or the lord's prayer
[03:17:45.440 --> 03:17:50.800]  or whatever feel free i mean um just because our government says that it's not uh sanctioned or
[03:17:50.800 --> 03:17:54.320]  that you don't have to do it i feel like that empowers it a little bit at least empowers the
[03:17:54.320 --> 03:18:00.240]  individual to have to do it and uh you know find time on themselves um absolutely if you don't
[03:18:00.240 --> 03:18:04.880]  exercise your freedoms you will lose them that's that's absolutely for sure thank you mark let's
[03:18:04.880 --> 03:18:15.280]  go to uh joshua and california joshua yeah hello hey how you doing doing very good hey um i had
[03:18:15.280 --> 03:18:19.120]  some questions uh i want to bring up about religion but since you guys are kind of on the
[03:18:19.120 --> 03:18:25.120]  topic of the constitution um one of the things that a lot of people don't understand particularly
[03:18:25.120 --> 03:18:30.480]  of the the history of our constitution the way it is and how the framework was set up a lot of
[03:18:30.480 --> 03:18:35.920]  people think of george washington as being the first president when we actually had other forms
[03:18:35.920 --> 03:18:41.520]  of government before that here in this country and even before that like it was really you know
[03:18:41.520 --> 03:18:45.920]  under british rule and so on but the article is a confederation you're talking about them
[03:18:46.880 --> 03:18:51.200]  yeah and then the first and second uh uh congressional what was with the congress or
[03:18:51.200 --> 03:18:56.160]  something like that was basically like those forms of government and then i know they tried
[03:18:56.160 --> 03:19:00.640]  the federalists but then there was issues with people having to be unanimous and agreeing with
[03:19:00.640 --> 03:19:05.040]  something so they were like well what are we going to do and so they came up with this this idea and
[03:19:05.040 --> 03:19:09.760]  i one of the things i know like in my contrast entry i kind of explain a little bit of like that
[03:19:09.760 --> 03:19:14.400]  because i i think that this information is out there it's just not been put together for people
[03:19:14.400 --> 03:19:19.440]  a lot of people think of like the federal reserve as being this you know really bad entity and all
[03:19:19.440 --> 03:19:24.800]  and it's it all started because of that but they don't really understand uh what happened during
[03:19:24.800 --> 03:19:29.600]  lincoln's time when they started introducing the legal tender act and then the national banking
[03:19:29.600 --> 03:19:35.520]  acts at that time as well right right yeah tyranny has a long history and it creeps up on us very
[03:19:35.520 --> 03:19:41.280]  very slowly and we have to to watch that and be aware of history and we see it not only repeating
[03:19:41.280 --> 03:19:57.200]  itself but intensifying itself we'll be right back with some more calls

[03:24:26.080 --> 03:24:32.880]  i-cap scandal that's breaking and quoting u.s attorney general eric holder saying that they

[03:25:12.640 --> 03:25:20.320]  everything that you report on and um that article was a very uh lengthy but informative article and
[03:25:20.320 --> 03:25:25.840]  anybody that can get through that can really understand um how literally just a team of 20
[03:25:25.840 --> 03:25:30.800]  people are controlling the price of everything across the globe absolutely absolutely it's just
[03:25:30.800 --> 03:25:38.800]  amazing isn't it yes it is also sir um on the side now i'm a local writer and reporter in austin texas
[03:25:39.600 --> 03:25:45.680]  and um i actually have been trying to get in touch with your team uh it's pretty much my dream and
[03:25:45.680 --> 03:25:52.240]  ambition at this point to work for infowars team i love what y'all do um i actually interviewed
[03:25:52.240 --> 03:25:58.080]  uh with your team last week uh for the magazine super and um i thought it went really great and
[03:25:58.080 --> 03:26:01.440]  i was just waiting this week to hear from them and i hadn't heard from them yet so i just thought
[03:26:01.440 --> 03:26:07.840]  i'd call in and okay get myself on your radar and all right i'll pass that information on to them
[03:26:07.840 --> 03:26:14.400]  i know they were really under the gun because to make the magazine as current as possible and to
[03:26:14.400 --> 03:26:18.480]  really hit these hot breaking issues uh you know just as we're getting ready to go to press with
[03:26:18.480 --> 03:26:24.160]  the magazine the uh boston marathon bombing happened and uh we really felt that it was
[03:26:24.160 --> 03:26:30.480]  imperative to do major rewrites in the magazine to make it as timely and as current and to address
[03:26:30.480 --> 03:26:35.600]  the whole issue especially of false flags and the history of false flags so they did a lot of
[03:26:35.600 --> 03:26:40.800]  rewriting under the gun to try to get that thing out and they did a fantastic job with this month's
[03:26:40.800 --> 03:26:46.720]  issue uh simon in florida are you there yeah i'm here hey what have you got for us simon
[03:26:47.760 --> 03:26:52.880]  well i'm interested to know why no one's reporting on these pictures on the internet about
[03:26:52.880 --> 03:26:59.840]  these first responders and these actors i mean if you look up on the internet are you just a believer
[03:26:59.840 --> 03:27:06.320]  or do you think there's plenty of websites that are showing pictures that look like they're
[03:27:06.320 --> 03:27:14.400]  staging the event putting prosthetics on bowman the guy in the wheelchair um later you see where
[03:27:14.400 --> 03:27:18.000]  and you'll see there's this black girl in front of him that's later on a stretcher and bowman
[03:27:18.000 --> 03:27:22.800]  to laying on the ground and nobody's attending to him well it's a in the scene it's a it's a
[03:27:22.800 --> 03:27:28.400]  difficult thing you know and when you look at there are so many different issues with this uh
[03:27:28.960 --> 03:27:33.360]  one of the things that we wanted to focus on is the fact that there was a bombing drill
[03:27:33.360 --> 03:27:38.880]  i remember when it was breaking on a monday and jakari jackson and i were here and that's the
[03:27:38.880 --> 03:27:44.480]  question we were asking and as we started hearing reports coming in of there being a drill and then
[03:27:44.480 --> 03:27:49.760]  paying a special attention to the finish line and that sort of thing we all wanted dan badandi to
[03:27:49.760 --> 03:27:54.480]  ask the question that he did ask at the press conference if there was a bombing drill and they
[03:27:54.480 --> 03:28:00.800]  would neither confirm nor deny that because that is what we have always seen as a hallmark of these
[03:28:00.800 --> 03:28:07.600]  false flags that they would have a drill going on just like they did at 9 11 same exact scenario
[03:28:07.600 --> 03:28:14.320]  same exact day and time so that people don't know what's going on for sure the first responders
[03:28:14.320 --> 03:28:20.080]  don't know if it's if it's real or if it's a drill and uh it also provides cover for them if they're
[03:28:20.080 --> 03:28:25.680]  caught faking something so we felt that was really important we've also looked at the uh
[03:28:25.680 --> 03:28:31.520]  contradictions and uh what's going on just as a crime scene reporting uh looking at things like
[03:28:31.520 --> 03:28:36.800]  the color of the backpack what's the probability of uh of them having a backpack inside another one
[03:28:36.800 --> 03:28:41.440]  if if the younger brother put a black backpack inside of a white backpack why didn't the
[03:28:41.440 --> 03:28:45.600]  mastermind of all this his older brother why didn't he do something like that so we're looking
[03:28:45.600 --> 03:28:51.360]  in and questioning a lot of these things are put out there that uh were fed now of course the
[03:28:51.360 --> 03:28:57.200]  question is certainly they do have crisis actors and uh there are some questionable pictures that
[03:28:57.200 --> 03:29:02.720]  we see coming up there but it's always a difficult thing to to pin down something like that and to
[03:29:02.720 --> 03:29:09.600]  prove that and so you know it's there's always going to be a core of something that is real in
[03:29:09.600 --> 03:29:15.920]  any event and they may uh elaborate on that they may uh sex that up for the cameras uh they may
[03:29:15.920 --> 03:29:22.640]  um uh fictionalize part of it but at its core is is a real explosion and so we have to take a look
[03:29:22.640 --> 03:29:29.120]  at that and and uh really kind of go with what we can absolutely prove and uh there's so many
[03:29:29.120 --> 03:29:33.360]  different areas on which we can attack the official story and look at what's going on
[03:29:33.360 --> 03:29:50.480]  the national agenda and look at what's going on on an international agenda and we'll be right back
[03:29:50.480 --> 03:29:57.120]  we're on the march the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[03:33:18.800 --> 03:33:23.840]  imagine and uh he's been doing a live remote from there as you probably know if you've been listening
[03:33:23.840 --> 03:33:28.320]  and we were talking earlier about uh he was talking with lionel about the different things
[03:33:28.320 --> 03:33:35.360]  that government has done in terms of uh purging christians and uh you know taking guns and then
[03:33:36.000 --> 03:33:39.920]  censoring people's freedom of speech when it comes to religion and that sort of thing as we've seen
[03:33:39.920 --> 03:33:45.440]  that happen historically and soviet union and other places you know it was pj o'rourke that
[03:33:45.440 --> 03:33:52.640]  said democrats think that god is santa claus and republicans think that he's god and he said the
[03:33:52.640 --> 03:33:58.000]  difference is santa claus doesn't exist and god does but you know they i think government really
[03:33:58.000 --> 03:34:04.160]  does think that it's god and it's a jealous god it doesn't want to have any other gods before it and
[03:34:04.160 --> 03:34:11.120]  that's especially true when you're talking about uh jesus you know they have a particular you look
[03:34:11.120 --> 03:34:16.720]  at what the air force academy is doing and they basically have set up this um place where they
[03:34:16.720 --> 03:34:22.800]  can have this pagan worship circle and everything but uh they're now talking about court-martialing
[03:34:22.800 --> 03:34:28.400]  people who share their faith even chaplains who do that and look at the way the government is
[03:34:28.400 --> 03:34:33.840]  operating you know what are the three attributes of god uh he's omnipotent all-powerful right well
[03:34:33.840 --> 03:34:40.800]  that's what they're doing they want all power all weapons all guns to belong to them god is
[03:34:40.800 --> 03:34:47.760]  omniscient they want to know everything just like god and they want to be omnipresent they want to
[03:34:47.760 --> 03:34:54.160]  be just like big brother in every aspect of your life whether it's telling you what size soft
[03:34:54.160 --> 03:35:00.800]  drinks you can have or anything they everything has to be done at their permission uh it's just
[03:35:00.800 --> 03:35:06.560]  amazing when you look at it but these people really do act as if they're god and so there is
[03:35:06.560 --> 03:35:12.160]  a definitely a spiritual component to this uh a very dark spiritual component to what's going on
[03:35:12.160 --> 03:35:18.800]  here i'm going to take a phone call now from uh scott in vermont scott are you there yes hi david
[03:35:18.800 --> 03:35:23.600]  hey how you doing scott all right uh yeah i don't know if lynel i used to listen to his radio show
[03:35:23.600 --> 03:35:28.400]  years ago uh national am show i don't know if he mentioned to you that he was a former prosecutor
[03:35:29.360 --> 03:35:33.440]  yeah and uh well he had no problem apparently putting people away for victimless crimes like
[03:35:33.440 --> 03:35:39.760]  marijuana but uh that's interesting joe uh i'm like judge napolitano who kind of uh i've seen
[03:35:39.760 --> 03:35:45.600]  him on youtube kind of repenting of that saying that the war on drugs is scam and he's sorry for
[03:35:45.600 --> 03:35:50.080]  putting people in jail for you know the victimless crimes like that but anyways you mentioned the
[03:35:50.080 --> 03:35:57.360]  supremacy clause um it also says that the judges in article six has the constitution supreme law
[03:35:57.360 --> 03:36:04.640]  the land and judges in all the land are bound to it yes well guess what happened another judge
[03:36:04.640 --> 03:36:10.560]  recently here in bradboro vermont um in the case of the uh the hinting new protesters or so-called
[03:36:10.560 --> 03:36:15.200]  grannies who stood in at the gate of the uh blocking the gate of the nuke plant here in vermont
[03:36:15.200 --> 03:36:19.920]  yankee um they finally uh they're doing it many times they finally prosecuted them and put them
[03:36:19.920 --> 03:36:24.720]  around the trial um they didn't want to spend the money or time whatever they finally did and uh
[03:36:24.720 --> 03:36:28.960]  they tried to enter the bill of rights of the constitution into their into evidence and the
[03:36:28.960 --> 03:36:35.920]  judge denied it well they should have brought up the the constitution and uh it doesn't mean the
[03:36:35.920 --> 03:36:41.520]  states don't have rights but it does say that that the judges in the land are abound to the state of
[03:36:41.520 --> 03:36:46.560]  the supreme law of the land yeah absolutely you know we need to make sure that we need to really
[03:36:46.560 --> 03:36:51.200]  push on fully informed juries because we've got judges telling jurors that they don't have both
[03:36:51.200 --> 03:36:56.960]  the right and the duty to judge not only the facts of the case but the law itself and that has always
[03:36:56.960 --> 03:37:02.560]  been not only the tradition of english and american law but it's also written into the state
[03:37:02.560 --> 03:37:09.040]  constitutions in many many states and uh i interviewed a fellow uh the new jersey weed man
[03:37:09.040 --> 03:37:14.080]  who basically represented himself because most lawyers are afraid to tell uh juries about the
[03:37:14.080 --> 03:37:20.400]  fully informed jury uh issue and so he represented himself and he went to had two trials the first
[03:37:20.400 --> 03:37:27.520]  one he put up a quote directly out of the new jersey constitution and said that jurors could
[03:37:27.520 --> 03:37:32.960]  judge the law being a good law or not as well as just the facts of the case he never said that he
[03:37:32.960 --> 03:37:37.360]  hadn't been in possession of the marijuana and the first judge said you take that down or you're
[03:37:37.360 --> 03:37:43.280]  going to jail for contempt but they had already seen it and he had a hung jury of seven to five
[03:37:43.280 --> 03:37:49.200]  they retried him on that the next judge let him just leave that on his desk and he did and he was
[03:37:49.200 --> 03:37:54.400]  acquitted 12 to nothing and they can't come after him again so that's a very powerful thing the
[03:37:54.400 --> 03:38:00.320]  other thing we have to be concerned about is this whole idea that judges the supreme court is
[03:38:00.320 --> 03:38:05.440]  invested with power to be the final arbiter of what's going on whether something a law is
[03:38:05.440 --> 03:38:10.000]  constitutional or not and jefferson spoke directly to that because he was involved with marbury
[03:38:10.000 --> 03:38:13.920]  versus madison and he said the question whether judges are invested with exclusive authority to
[03:38:13.920 --> 03:38:19.360]  decide on the constitutionality of a law has been heretofore a subject to consideration with me in
[03:38:19.360 --> 03:38:25.440]  the exercise of official duties certainly there is not a word in the constitution that gives that
[03:38:25.440 --> 03:38:30.400]  power to them more than it does to the the executive or legislative branches and he said
[03:38:30.400 --> 03:38:36.720]  to think that judges are the ultimate arbiters of all constitutional questions is a dangerous
[03:38:36.720 --> 03:38:42.720]  doctrine indeed and would place us under the despotism of an oligarchy and then i won't read
[03:38:42.720 --> 03:38:47.520]  the rest of this quote but he goes on and even says that if we accept that the constitution
[03:38:47.520 --> 03:38:53.520]  becomes a suicide pack because what we've done is we've turned over all the power to nine
[03:38:53.520 --> 03:39:01.120]  politically appointed judges who have their own special interests and biases and can be bribed
[03:39:01.120 --> 03:39:06.880]  or have other interests that they you know influence them we dare not take the clear
[03:39:06.880 --> 03:39:13.280]  constitution the clear uh wording of the constitution and turn that over to the whims of
[03:39:13.280 --> 03:39:19.600]  a political uh judiciary are you there scott we're supposed to have a balance of powers and also
[03:39:19.600 --> 03:39:23.760]  about eric holder that's something that the left and the right have common ground upon i was
[03:39:23.760 --> 03:39:28.960]  listening to the radio show i tried to call in with my own senator uh bernie sanders he's a
[03:39:28.960 --> 03:39:35.120]  socialist but uh at least he voted against the patriot act and the ndaa unlike our other senator
[03:39:35.120 --> 03:39:40.720]  pat lay he helped co-write the patriot act and he's supposed to be seen as a champion of our
[03:39:40.720 --> 03:39:44.240]  liberties and the sheep will fawn all over him for some reason well you know you're talking
[03:39:44.240 --> 03:39:49.360]  you're talking about prosecutors and former prosecutors i've talked to uh jim gearack who was
[03:39:49.360 --> 03:39:56.800]  a bird for decades he was a prosecutor in chicago prosecuting people for uh drug crimes and and
[03:39:56.800 --> 03:40:02.480]  things like that but he now is part of an organization called leap law enforcement against
[03:40:02.480 --> 03:40:06.160]  against prohibition and we've talked to him a couple of times and one of the things that he
[03:40:06.160 --> 03:40:12.960]  told us and this directly addresses what obama is saying in mexico obama wants to blame the violence
[03:40:12.960 --> 03:40:17.840]  in mexico and there's a tremendous amount of violence there and the drug war he wants to blame
[03:40:17.840 --> 03:40:22.640]  it on the fact that they're getting guns from the united states when eric holder his attorney general
[03:40:22.640 --> 03:40:29.920]  was involved in illegally shipping guns to mexico but the real issue is not guns the real issue is
[03:40:29.920 --> 03:40:37.920]  drug prohibition and uh jim gearock said that uh the chicago police chief has said that 80 of the
[03:40:37.920 --> 03:40:43.920]  shootings in chicago are due to the drug war and that's what's really going on in mexico that's the
[03:40:43.920 --> 03:40:48.720]  root of the violence in mexico is a drug war and if you look at the root of the drugs and the drug
[03:40:48.720 --> 03:40:55.040]  war that goes right back to the american cia and our american involvement in places like afghanistan
[03:40:55.040 --> 03:41:00.720]  that had nearly the supply of poppy based drugs had dropped to only 10 of the world's supply
[03:41:00.720 --> 03:41:04.720]  coming out of afghanistan after we got in there and you can go back and look at the new york
[03:41:04.720 --> 03:41:10.640]  times and you can see them you can see soldiers helping poppy farmers grow this stuff and ship
[03:41:10.640 --> 03:41:18.240]  it out now afghanistan accounts for 90 percent of the poppy-based drugs like heroin and cocaine
[03:41:18.240 --> 03:41:24.560]  that's after the united states military went in there after we helped to do that and the cia has
[03:41:24.560 --> 03:41:31.520]  been dependent on that drug trade for a long time for money to run their black ops uh it's if you
[03:41:31.520 --> 03:41:36.000]  go back and you look at the drug war you see the roots of it and you see that it's not only just
[03:41:36.000 --> 03:41:41.200]  the drug wars but it's prohibition in general uh go back and look at the alcohol prohibition and
[03:41:41.200 --> 03:41:46.880]  look at how it corrupted the judiciary and that's why former so many former retired prosecutors like
[03:41:46.880 --> 03:41:53.520]  jim gearock as well as retired cops are now speaking out against prohibition uh let's go
[03:41:53.520 --> 03:42:00.400]  to uh jim in connecticut jim how are you good how are you today doing good understanding with we
[03:42:00.400 --> 03:42:07.440]  are change yeah we are change connecticut we are change uh ct.org great our website and i just
[03:42:07.440 --> 03:42:12.800]  wanted to shout out to the connecticut listeners that it's time to get off your butts start making
[03:42:12.800 --> 03:42:17.920]  action stop just posting on facebook and twitter that's not where the battle's at the battle's on
[03:42:17.920 --> 03:42:23.440]  the street we're looking for people to get involved come up and join up with us that we are change
[03:42:23.440 --> 03:42:28.320]  ct.org and just get on the street man because there's a lot going on you've been doing a lot
[03:42:28.320 --> 03:42:32.320]  these last six months we have we've confronted madeline alt right she still thinks it's okay
[03:42:32.320 --> 03:42:39.600]  that they killed over 500 000 iraqis and it's just uh so now you're saying uh get off you're
[03:42:39.600 --> 03:42:44.080]  saying get off of facebook and get off of twitter and get on the street so you're advocating that
[03:42:44.080 --> 03:42:49.680]  people go out and uh do citizen journalism right out on the streets yes sir well what i noticed
[03:42:49.680 --> 03:42:53.600]  a lot with the i've been involved with the group for about five years now in connecticut
[03:42:53.600 --> 03:42:58.400]  um a lot of people want to get involved but they are their umbilical cords are still attached to
[03:42:58.400 --> 03:43:04.720]  the system and uh they just cannot get off the couch and go make action they're they're more
[03:43:04.720 --> 03:43:10.560]  inclined to reposting you know your articles or whatnot and that's really not you know that's
[03:43:10.560 --> 03:43:14.880]  good and all but you're not targeting the people that you need to because that you're only targeting
[03:43:14.880 --> 03:43:20.320]  your friends and it's the people that don't have facebook it's the people that you know work 12 14
[03:43:20.320 --> 03:43:25.360]  hour days that don't get to go home and really listen to what's really happening just on the tv
[03:43:25.360 --> 03:43:29.520]  and just watch the mainstream you're preaching to the choir when you're on you're talking to your
[03:43:29.520 --> 03:43:33.760]  friends on facebook although sometimes you'll be friends casually with somebody they might not share
[03:43:33.760 --> 03:43:38.080]  your political views and so sometimes that is a pretty good place to hit people with it but i
[03:43:38.080 --> 03:43:44.240]  think it's a real key thing to go out and engage people and uh you know as you mentioned you engaged
[03:43:44.240 --> 03:43:49.600]  madeline albright again um you know that that's what we are changed does so well i really
[03:43:49.600 --> 03:43:54.560]  appreciate the work that you're doing there uh let's go to uh joe in kansas joe are you there
[03:43:55.200 --> 03:44:00.880]  yes i am dave hey i really appreciate what you said about jefferson there you know also in that
[03:44:00.880 --> 03:44:08.560]  same uh basey in the same context he also prescribed term limits on everybody but then
[03:44:09.200 --> 03:44:14.080]  senate representatives and judicial because otherwise as he said you'll get an oligarchy
[03:44:14.080 --> 03:44:19.840]  established that's right and i think uh virginia is the only place that i know of that has a
[03:44:20.400 --> 03:44:24.800]  single term limit for governor and i think uh you know that had a lot to do with jefferson
[03:44:24.800 --> 03:44:30.400]  and madison and uh you know the people who are very very much aware of the evils of staying in
[03:44:30.400 --> 03:44:36.160]  office forever it was george washington essentially set the precedent of just two terms and uh
[03:44:36.160 --> 03:44:43.040]  everybody kind of abided by that until you got to fdr and then people got afraid that you know
[03:44:43.040 --> 03:44:47.600]  with so much control of the media we might have somebody that just might decide that he
[03:44:47.600 --> 03:44:50.800]  wanted to be president for life and could actually pull it off and so that's why they
[03:44:51.760 --> 03:44:58.160]  put the amendment to stop that and yet uh we have people saying that that ought to be lifted now
[03:44:58.160 --> 03:45:03.120]  that we ought to we're going to have people like uh obama in forever or george bush in forever
[03:45:03.120 --> 03:45:05.920]  uh you had something here about seizure of guns you wanted to talk about
[03:45:06.480 --> 03:45:13.200]  well yes uh governor uh brownback i was just thinking about his response to eric holder's
[03:45:13.760 --> 03:45:20.720]  uh letter what did he say because i haven't seen that response how did he respond to holder's
[03:45:20.720 --> 03:45:30.640]  letter well he said uh brownback replied in a letter thursday that kensins hold dear their
[03:45:30.640 --> 03:45:37.280]  right to bear arms and are protecting the state sovereign secretary state sovereignty secretary
[03:45:37.280 --> 03:45:44.480]  of state uh chris uh kolbuch a former law professor who helped draft the law accused
[03:45:44.480 --> 03:45:50.320]  the nation's top law enforcement officer of blustering over the issue people in kansas
[03:45:50.320 --> 03:45:55.840]  have clearly expressed their sovereign will brownback said in the uh conclusion of his
[03:45:55.840 --> 03:46:00.880]  letter it is my hope that upon further review you will see their right to do so well you know
[03:46:00.880 --> 03:46:04.560]  holder's concerned about this because this is this is breaking in a lot of different places like i
[03:46:04.560 --> 03:46:11.120]  mentioned the ohio house uh had a bill that got first hearing um the missouri house passed a
[03:46:11.120 --> 03:46:15.680]  stronger bill than the ohio one that would actually do what kansas does not only nullify
[03:46:15.680 --> 03:46:22.800]  gun laws the missouri one uh nullifies gun laws passed after january the 1st 2013 and would make
[03:46:22.800 --> 03:46:28.400]  it felonies for uh federal to attempt to enforce new gun laws so this kind of stuff is breaking
[03:46:28.400 --> 03:46:33.920]  out all over the place and we see it happening uh on the marijuana front as well and what you're
[03:46:33.920 --> 03:46:38.400]  what you're seeing here is people exercising the tenth amendment and a lot of these reports are
[03:46:38.400 --> 03:46:42.480]  coming from the tenth amendment center go there and take a look at their website get educated
[03:46:42.480 --> 03:46:48.960]  about that uh they are not given according to the bill of rights uh anything that is not
[03:46:48.960 --> 03:46:55.360]  expressly delegated to the federals is reserved as a power by the states and by the people and
[03:46:55.360 --> 03:47:00.880]  one of the things that uh the uh federals are prohibited from doing is having a permanent
[03:47:00.880 --> 03:47:05.360]  perpetual standing army if you look at article one section eight they are not allowed to fund
[03:47:05.360 --> 03:47:08.720]  the military for more than two years at a time so that's that's another thing we ought to be
[03:47:08.720 --> 03:47:13.280]  complaining about the ndaa it's not just the fact that they try to overturn the sixth amendment
[03:47:13.280 --> 03:47:19.840]  but they're also uh unconstitutionally uh extending a standing army funding year after year after year
[03:47:19.840 --> 03:47:24.720]  and we've now got a standing army that's going on since world war ii we we've never stood down the
[03:47:24.720 --> 03:47:29.360]  army we just continually build it because that's what the military industrial complex wants that's
[03:47:29.360 --> 03:47:34.880]  what the bankers want so uh it goes all the way back to looking at the core the body of the
[03:47:34.880 --> 03:47:41.440]  constitution article one section eight the second amendment just reinforces that and says oh and by
[03:47:41.440 --> 03:47:46.080]  the way we're specifically reserving the right to keep and bear arms for individuals and then
[03:47:46.080 --> 03:47:51.360]  goes further in the tenth amendment and says and oh by the way anything that isn't expressly given
[03:47:51.360 --> 03:47:57.680]  to you is reserved to us so there's so many prohibitions against really the gun laws that
[03:47:57.680 --> 03:48:01.520]  we have on the books are an infringement of the second amendment and i guess they figured that
[03:48:01.520 --> 03:48:07.600]  since we accept that that we're going to continue to accept further infringements but what we need
[03:48:07.600 --> 03:48:11.760]  to do is stand firm on that and we need to start rolling back these other ones and i don't think
[03:48:11.760 --> 03:48:18.080]  it's going to happen in washington we're going to have to get people in the states as well as the
[03:48:18.080 --> 03:48:23.200]  state houses and state governors to stand firm on this so hopefully brownback is going to stand firm
[03:48:23.200 --> 03:48:30.000]  on that let's go to cyrus and michigan cyrus are you there yeah how are you today david doing fine
[03:48:30.000 --> 03:48:34.720]  hey david there's a couple quick topics i want to talk about real quick i'm from detroit michigan a
[03:48:34.720 --> 03:48:40.080]  long time listener uh you guys you guys discuss a lot about how um you're questioning things that
[03:48:40.080 --> 03:48:43.520]  you've been fed and things that you've been told and you try to it seems like you guys try to put
[03:48:43.520 --> 03:48:48.560]  together a lot of different resources that are just out there and bring them to people's attention
[03:48:48.560 --> 03:48:53.120]  the thing is is that there's a lot of um a lot of the articles that you guys are pulling together are
[03:48:53.120 --> 03:48:58.640]  laced with a lot of intelligence within them and there's only people that are going to be really
[03:48:58.640 --> 03:49:02.800]  be able to break that through for you are former intelligence officers they know and they can
[03:49:02.800 --> 03:49:09.600]  really help you that's probably the article i would take well you know i had an uh an interview
[03:49:09.600 --> 03:49:13.280]  earlier this week with cebel edmunds you're talking about former intelligence people she
[03:49:13.280 --> 03:49:21.840]  worked as a translator for the fbi and uh she was involved in the area of she's uh she's
[03:49:21.840 --> 03:49:28.880]  of she's uh turkish uh well she's part iranian and um but she spoke uh the turkish language and
[03:49:28.880 --> 03:49:35.120]  she was an interpreter there and her area included not only turkey but also the caucuses regions
[03:49:35.120 --> 03:49:41.120]  where uh chechnya is involved and azure baijan and if you look at that area it's tremendously
[03:49:41.120 --> 03:49:49.280]  important strategically because it is geographically contiguous to um not only the soviet union but to
[03:49:49.280 --> 03:49:56.160]  china and what the u.s government was doing was essentially a second version of gladio according
[03:49:56.160 --> 03:50:00.320]  to cebel who had seen documents and had seen what had been happening in these different countries
[03:50:00.960 --> 03:50:08.560]  and she has a a really interesting series of uh videos that she did that's about four hours
[03:50:08.560 --> 03:50:13.840]  altogether uh back in january talking about how if you're aware of operation gladio and many of
[03:50:13.840 --> 03:50:20.560]  our listeners are it was an operation that was set up in uh europe and darren mcbreen did a
[03:50:20.560 --> 03:50:25.600]  wonderful report with a guy who wrote a book uh about that and went into great detail on that look
[03:50:25.600 --> 03:50:32.720]  up that report from darren mcbreen on youtube and on prison planet tv but basically they stood that
[03:50:32.720 --> 03:50:37.760]  down at the as the cold war ended and they were looking around for another enemy and that's gladio
[03:50:37.760 --> 03:50:41.760]  part b and we're gonna follow up and talk about that a little bit right after the break i'm david
[03:50:41.760 --> 03:50:46.960]  knight here standing in for alex jones on the infowars nightly not nightly news we're here on

[03:54:16.640 --> 03:54:22.400]  be back uh he's on his way back to austin back to the bunker and it has been confirmed
[03:54:22.400 --> 03:54:28.240]  that this is the alex jones show not the nightly news as i started to say i do that typically and
[03:54:28.240 --> 03:54:32.640]  we were just talking about an interview that i had earlier this week with c bell edmunds
[03:54:32.640 --> 03:54:37.360]  the previous caller said that we really needed to get some analysis for people who had worked
[03:54:37.360 --> 03:54:42.720]  on the inside and she is someone that daniel ellsberg who leaked the pentagon papers said
[03:54:42.720 --> 03:54:48.400]  that the information that she has about september 11th is a much bigger story than the pentagon
[03:54:48.400 --> 03:54:52.720]  papers i would agree with him and there's an even bigger story that's breaking and it's connected
[03:54:52.720 --> 03:54:58.160]  to the boston bombing and that is and we talked about this in the interview so check that out on
[03:54:58.160 --> 03:55:04.960]  youtube on prison planet tv she connected the dots to graham fuller who was a former cia head
[03:55:04.960 --> 03:55:11.120]  of the region of turkey and the caucuses also it just turns out with an amazing coincidence was
[03:55:11.120 --> 03:55:17.520]  father-in-law to uncle ruslan remember uncle ruslan ruslan sarniova the guy that threw his
[03:55:17.520 --> 03:55:24.800]  nephews under the bus so quickly and reputed them well it turns out that the biggest cia guy
[03:55:24.800 --> 03:55:32.960]  in the turkey and caucus regions was actually his father-in-law and she also connects some dots to
[03:55:32.960 --> 03:55:40.960]  an imam gulan who is a radical muslim who is who has had to flee turkey basically with the
[03:55:40.960 --> 03:55:47.360]  assistance of the cia set up housekeeping in the united states and has become a multi-billionaire
[03:55:47.360 --> 03:55:55.360]  and founded 350 radical madrasas around the world and this is a fellow who has not set foot outside
[03:55:55.360 --> 03:56:00.960]  of the virginia area since he came was brought over here by the cia so when you start looking
[03:56:00.960 --> 03:56:08.240]  at some of this insider information you start looking at what cebel edmunds has learned as an
[03:56:08.240 --> 03:56:15.440]  fbi translator you start to question even whether this is blowback you know whether this is this
[03:56:15.440 --> 03:56:21.600]  terrorism is really a reaction to our ham-fisted foreign policy in so many different areas or is
[03:56:21.600 --> 03:56:27.520]  this something that was designed to be a profit center for the military industrial complex after
[03:56:27.520 --> 03:56:34.000]  the cold war broke down and she makes a very compelling case for it being by design and not
[03:56:34.000 --> 03:56:40.160]  a blowback let's take another call from terry in washington terry are you there hello terry yeah
[03:56:40.160 --> 03:56:46.560]  david you hear me all right yes you're fine what's up hey you do a great job thank you hey me like
[03:56:46.560 --> 03:56:55.120]  everybody else in the world i mean in the world the day of the boston uh marathon marathon i
[03:56:55.120 --> 03:57:01.840]  think something's going on behind the scenes uh completely out of you know nobody nobody even was
[03:57:01.840 --> 03:57:11.120]  even thinking about it that explosion at the fertilizer plant yeah it was convenient timing
[03:57:11.120 --> 03:57:17.040]  wasn't it you know happening there in uh in waco just the day before the anniversary of the branch
[03:57:17.040 --> 03:57:23.920]  davidian situation and also using fertilizer just like uh that we were told is what happened at the
[03:57:23.920 --> 03:57:31.840]  oklahoma city bombing although uh former retired uh general who was a demolitions expert wasn't buying
[03:57:31.840 --> 03:57:38.560]  it at the time and there's an excellent documentary about that uh that holland van lienhof if i'm
[03:57:38.560 --> 03:57:43.920]  pronouncing his name correctly he wrote uh a noble lie uh we sell that here at info wars you need to
[03:57:43.920 --> 03:57:47.920]  see that about the oklahoma city bombing if you haven't seen that it's an amazing story and it
[03:57:47.920 --> 03:57:54.720]  takes a while for these stories to come out we interviewed a documentarian who uh he spent 10
[03:57:54.720 --> 03:58:00.640]  years going over the waco story it takes a very long time for all the facts to come out but we
[03:58:00.640 --> 03:58:05.840]  can tell right away we can when we start seeing contradictions and changing stories and things
[03:58:05.840 --> 03:58:10.240]  like bomb drills taking place at the same time there's a bomb we know something's wrong even
[03:58:10.240 --> 03:58:18.320]  though it'll take a while well that's it for today thanks for joining us on the alex jones show i'm david knight
