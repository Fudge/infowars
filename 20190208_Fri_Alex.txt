[00:00.000 --> 00:26.000]  The Alex Jones show, because there is a war on, or your mind.
[00:26.000 --> 00:42.000]  There is a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[00:42.000 --> 00:54.000]  Alex Jones, before a conspiracy theorist who was a parent.
[00:54.000 --> 00:58.000]  Alex Jones.
[00:58.000 --> 01:04.000]  Scum! Russian scum!
[01:04.000 --> 01:09.000]  If a war comes to mind.
[01:09.000 --> 01:19.000]  Reputation is amazing. I will not let you down. You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[01:19.000 --> 01:25.000]  This is an emergency transmission from deep in the heart of Texas, the U.S. resistance against a global corporate combine,
[01:25.000 --> 01:31.000]  empowered and funded by Communist China, allied with the big mega banks that set up Communist China in 1949.
[01:31.000 --> 01:35.000]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of U.S. telecommunications infrastructure.
[01:35.000 --> 01:39.000]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of Hollywood. The Communist Chinese have taken control of the main universities.
[01:39.000 --> 01:42.000]  This is all confirmed. This is not a drill.
[01:42.000 --> 01:46.000]  Big Tech and Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the Communist Chinese government.
[01:46.000 --> 01:49.000]  They've officially become state-run. Apple 100%.
[01:49.000 --> 01:54.000]  Google is now making the transition and announcing a merger in total worldwide censorship.
[01:54.000 --> 01:59.000]  They are now beta testing using me as the straw man, a demonized version of Alex Jones, to do that.
[01:59.000 --> 02:05.000]  This is happening. This is not like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship,
[02:05.000 --> 02:08.000]  thinking you would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it.
[02:08.000 --> 02:14.000]  Now, this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude of all previous attacks.
[02:14.000 --> 02:23.000]  This is a titrated dose, reverse psychological warfare operation using adapt and overcome subversion paradigm manipulation.
[02:23.000 --> 02:27.000]  In layman's terms, they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed.
[02:27.000 --> 02:31.000]  We adapt to being oppressed with the low dosages of oppression.
[02:31.000 --> 02:37.000]  Now, when the megaton hits us of the total takeover, we try to adapt to the poison infusion,
[02:37.000 --> 02:41.000]  instead of not knowing it's a lethal dose if we accept the dose.
[02:41.000 --> 02:46.000]  Total Internet of Things integration, global social score, complete command and control system.
[02:46.000 --> 02:53.000]  It is the virtual reality AI weapon system now attacking the United States with traders inside the major security agencies,
[02:53.000 --> 02:58.000]  blocking Trump's resistance of the program and attempting to stop us from removing the tentacles
[02:58.000 --> 03:02.000]  of the Chai-Com slash Big Tech begging combine emergency situation.
[03:02.000 --> 03:05.000]  I have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information
[03:05.000 --> 03:08.000]  and have been battering, ramming it out as much as I can.
[03:08.000 --> 03:14.000]  They want to double use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception
[03:14.000 --> 03:17.000]  where every angle of my good is turned against us.
[03:17.000 --> 03:22.000]  So they take what I've said, being sincere, building into an insincere person in the strawman.
[03:22.000 --> 03:26.000]  I'm a person that cares about life and children and is against these wars.
[03:26.000 --> 03:28.000]  And so they make me a herder of children.
[03:28.000 --> 03:31.000]  And then they build me into this line to then set the distraction
[03:31.000 --> 03:36.000]  while they're actually censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones.
[03:36.000 --> 03:43.000]  So even if I didn't sell out to them, they now use me as an archetype to serve them by being the main distraction.
[03:43.000 --> 03:49.000]  I have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum and it's being used against you.
[03:49.000 --> 03:54.000]  Surely your full understanding of this key will break you free from this paradigm.
[03:54.000 --> 03:57.000]  I have given you the transmission, now break free!
[04:00.000 --> 04:10.000]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[04:10.000 --> 04:12.000]  Thomas Jefferson.
[04:12.000 --> 04:21.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[04:21.000 --> 04:27.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this Friday, February 8, 2019 broadcast.
[04:27.000 --> 04:32.000]  I am not going to be able to be on air right now because we're working on such a big important story.
[04:32.000 --> 04:38.000]  I'm going to have to air some promos when we come back because I need to get our ducks in a row.
[04:38.000 --> 04:43.000]  Last night we got blindsided by some of the raw footage being released by Sinclair.
[04:43.000 --> 04:45.000]  I can tell you where it all came from, how they got it.
[04:45.000 --> 04:50.000]  It was leaked by someone in the house or Senate Judiciary Committee.
[04:50.000 --> 04:52.000]  It was not released by Roger Stone.
[04:52.000 --> 04:58.000]  We have all the raw footage, we've been authorized to release it and it shows stunning criminal activity by the government.
[04:58.000 --> 05:09.000]  We'll show it to you.
[05:29.000 --> 05:38.000]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[05:38.000 --> 05:41.000]  There's nothing else like it, you must experience it.
[05:41.000 --> 05:48.000]  It is a total game changer and it comes in easy to use, packaged, mixed with fruit juice or water, whatever you like.
[05:48.000 --> 05:53.000]  Warning though, it's very, very strong, it lasts 10 hours, so take a half packet the first time you take it
[05:53.000 --> 05:57.000]  because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[05:57.000 --> 05:59.000]  TurboForce and enforcelive.com
[06:27.000 --> 06:49.000]  It's Friday, February 8th, 2019. You get tomorrow's news today.
[06:49.000 --> 06:59.000]  Okay, I'm going to go to some recent reports we did and some important information and then either next segment or next segment after that.
[06:59.000 --> 07:03.000]  Not sure yet, I'll be back ready to premiere this information.
[07:03.000 --> 07:14.000]  But something this important, I need to go over it one more time and we're also going to blur the faces of the FBI agents even though they wouldn't do that for us in the general public.
[07:14.000 --> 07:20.000]  And so we've got to deal with that and we had a computer crash while it was doing it, so that's not the issue.
[07:20.000 --> 07:28.000]  We have the exclusive complete FBI raid, they took the wrong DVR, they tried to cover the cameras up with tape, they were not successful.
[07:28.000 --> 07:35.000]  And Roger didn't even give us this footage to put on air.
[07:35.000 --> 07:49.000]  He gave it to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees and he was told it was also then shared around with some other committees and that his lawyers had them promise,
[07:49.000 --> 07:57.000]  because obviously they reached out seeing if they had any footage of the raid, that they would not leak it because the court's trying to gag Roger right now.
[07:57.000 --> 08:01.000]  And so he expressly had agreements through his lawyers that they would not leak it.
[08:01.000 --> 08:06.000]  Well, they leaked it to Sinclair, meaning it's probably Republicans, they probably thought they were helping Roger.
[08:06.000 --> 08:16.000]  So Roger, overnighted to me last night, the FEDEX and UPS in case there was a problem, one arrived at 9am, one arrived at 10am.
[08:16.000 --> 08:27.000]  We went in and tried reviewing the footage while I was here getting ready for the broadcast and it's so horrible and also so dangerous.
[08:27.000 --> 08:34.000]  They'll definitely be payback for what we're going to do here, but you know what, somebody's got to step up to this type of criminal activity.
[08:34.000 --> 08:40.000]  But the brazen nakedness of this, this could take down the whole Mueller probe.
[08:40.000 --> 08:48.000]  Post probe, because it's dangerous, it's Byzantine, it's draconian, it's authoritarian, it's unconstitutional.
[08:48.000 --> 09:06.000]  How the FBI lied, I guess the Mueller group and how the Democrats lied and how CNN lied, I know that's a big, big surprise, about CNN being tipped off to be there.
[09:06.000 --> 09:13.000]  Now, it's a felony to give out warrant information before it's served, federal law, state law.
[09:13.000 --> 09:28.000]  It's also illegal on many other fronts, obviously, you don't want propaganda productions in arrest situations, that's beyond police state, that's running man type stuff.
[09:28.000 --> 09:35.000]  I started talking to Roger this morning, he had some really bad family news, so he's been out of commission on my liberty to get into that, but it's really bad.
[09:35.000 --> 09:44.000]  So when it rains, it pours, pray for Roger, about the worst type of news you can get. I'm just leaving it at that for some family, separate from this whole fiasco.
[09:44.000 --> 09:54.000]  But by the time I talked to him this morning, he was telling me what was on the footage that I would get this morning, because we flew out there the day after it happened.
[09:54.000 --> 09:58.000]  We wanted the footage, and they thought the FBI had taken everything.
[09:58.000 --> 10:01.000]  Well, then they're like, wait, this isn't a TV, DVR, this is the camera footage.
[10:01.000 --> 10:12.000]  By the grace of God, they took the wrong stuff. And so then I was talking to Roger saying, hey, give us the footage, which he just gave it to his lawyers, and he goes, no, no, I don't want to get a gag put on me.
[10:12.000 --> 10:23.000]  He was busy in all the court cases and interviews, and his lawyers are like, Roger, what's on this hard drive is incredibly dangerous.
[10:23.000 --> 10:32.000]  And they'd already had some Republicans questioning Graham and others who reached out, seeing if there was any footage. So they contacted him. They talked to advisors in Congress.
[10:32.000 --> 10:42.000]  They said the way to do it is not to mail it, but to upload the footage directly to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, and that was done under agreement.
[10:42.000 --> 10:48.000]  Then they leaked it right before he's going to have his gagging hearing. Now, I don't know if they understand, that'll probably get him gagged now.
[10:48.000 --> 10:53.000]  They had to come out and tell the truth that he didn't do it.
[10:53.000 --> 11:01.000]  Everybody's focusing on the raid and then pointing a gun at his wife and all this stuff. That's not the news.
[11:01.000 --> 11:12.000]  We have the footage of the FBI, like they are Steven Spielsberg directing the whole thing.
[11:12.000 --> 11:22.000]  The camera guy telling him what to do, directing him. We can blow the footage up and you've got the FBI standing around him, telling him what to do while he's setting up and pointing at the House and getting ready.
[11:22.000 --> 11:31.000]  Then they all pull back, stage the raid, talk to him again during it, then tell him to get out of here so they can all pose and say, oh, we didn't know he was there. He's hiding in the bushes.
[11:31.000 --> 11:44.000]  I mean, premeditated criminal activity sent a chill up my spine because by the grace of God, they didn't get the footage.
[11:44.000 --> 11:50.000]  Then all Roger's trying to do is stay out of prison, no Russiagate, no nothing for his family.
[11:50.000 --> 12:06.000]  I've got the globalists breathing down my neck and they're the type of crooks that would just take us going, oh, here, FBI, have this, oh, they take that as weakness, probably put me in prison as a Russian agent.
[12:06.000 --> 12:12.000]  You're the agents of evil. You're the agents serving the globalists. You're the people out of control.
[12:12.000 --> 12:25.000]  Like, struck and all the rest of these damn people look like daemons. You're fricking nuts. You're out of control and America has to stand up against you and your whole fiasco.
[12:25.000 --> 12:31.000]  Why aren't you SWAT team and Hillary Clinton? Why aren't you SWAT team and George Soros? Real criminals.
[12:31.000 --> 12:38.000]  No, you're doing it to people that stood up for this country and kicked that witch's butt so she didn't get into office.
[12:38.000 --> 12:46.000]  See, I said I'd go to tape so I could get in here and review more of this and look at it because I'm not going to go off half cocked with this.
[12:46.000 --> 12:51.000]  But this is why they want us off here. So they could pull all this crap.
[12:51.000 --> 12:57.000]  And so time and time again, it's info wars in our audience and our intel that defeats the globalist.
[12:57.000 --> 13:04.000]  Mike Adams got contacted by Apple Development yesterday for his big app.
[13:04.000 --> 13:12.000]  And they said, no Satanism, no world government, no this, no that.
[13:12.000 --> 13:19.000]  No criticism of censorship. Now to get a news app approved, you have to sign an agreement that you won't talk about certain things.
[13:19.000 --> 13:24.000]  That's beyond Communist China.
[13:24.000 --> 13:28.000]  Let's move Roger to the bottom of the hour.
[13:28.000 --> 13:37.000]  Because we'll play these reports next segment and then I'm going to get my ducks in a robe.
[13:37.000 --> 13:48.000]  And we're going to air the raw footage of all three clips of the FBI directing the CNN cameraman.
[13:48.000 --> 13:52.000]  And then we're going to zoom it in.
[13:52.000 --> 13:58.000]  So you can see it better than Dallas and you can see there.
[13:58.000 --> 14:05.000]  We're already going to be posting these stills up as soon as they're ready to info wars.com.
[14:05.000 --> 14:11.000]  Global exclusive video shows FBI directing CNN cameraman at Roger Stone raid three times.
[14:11.000 --> 14:14.000]  We have the whole setup.
[14:14.000 --> 14:19.000]  Unbelievable to then illegally do it.
[14:19.000 --> 14:26.000]  He legally led a news organization know about a federal raid and a federal warrant place them.
[14:26.000 --> 14:31.000]  Had them show up beforehand, then block the roads, go up and talk to him, set up his tripod.
[14:31.000 --> 14:34.000]  He gets out of the car as soon as they pull up. It's all rehearsed.
[14:34.000 --> 14:40.000]  They go back. They start the raid. They talk to him during that.
[14:40.000 --> 14:43.000]  He's right there in the middle of them with the streets blocked.
[14:43.000 --> 14:46.000]  And then the bigger group FBI comes over. Good job. Good job.
[14:46.000 --> 14:51.000]  And you get out of here. He goes, gets in, leaves, stones brought out.
[14:51.000 --> 14:54.000]  And then they can put out their whole report.
[14:54.000 --> 15:02.000]  Now this is from Roger Stone's house, from his surveillance cameras.
[15:02.000 --> 15:05.000]  And they're going to do the same thing they always do.
[15:05.000 --> 15:11.000]  Just like the karate chop thing when Acosta is, you know, grabbing the mic back and pushing her arm down.
[15:11.000 --> 15:16.000]  Oh, Jones. He doctored the tape. So because we zoomed in, so you can see what he did.
[15:16.000 --> 15:21.000]  We're putting the raw footage out. And then right after it, we're going to show it zoomed in.
[15:21.000 --> 15:24.000]  And anybody can zoom in the raw footage. They're still going to change the subject.
[15:24.000 --> 15:29.000]  It's what they always do. It doesn't matter. America sees through this, just like the Covington kids,
[15:29.000 --> 15:33.000]  or just like the Democrats not standing for saying, let's not kill already born babies.
[15:33.000 --> 15:37.000]  These people are out of control because no one has reigned them in.
[15:37.000 --> 15:42.000]  Like Thomas Jefferson said, when the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[15:42.000 --> 15:47.000]  When the people fear the government, there is tyranny. I must execute my duty against this.
[15:47.000 --> 15:52.000]  And I'm proud of our crew. I'm proud of Roger Stone. Victory or death.
[15:52.000 --> 16:08.000]  1776. Worldwide. USA. USA. The real USA.

[17:04.000 --> 17:09.000]  I was 35 with two beautiful children when my life and addiction started to spiral out of control.
[17:09.000 --> 17:16.000]  After my divorce, I went into a depression cycle and started drinking more often and using prescription drugs.
[17:16.000 --> 17:21.000]  After my second DWI and arrest, my ex-husband threatened to take our children away from me.
[17:21.000 --> 17:28.000]  I was 17 when I became addicted to heroin and meth. I thought I could quit on my own, but I couldn't.
[17:28.000 --> 17:31.000]  It hit me when I was arrested.

[19:00.000 --> 19:05.000]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[19:05.000 --> 19:11.000]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[19:11.000 --> 19:16.000]  That's why I'm introducing Z Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[19:16.000 --> 19:20.000]  It's made in the USA. It's filled with known compounds from nature
[19:20.000 --> 19:24.000]  that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the InfoWars.
[19:24.000 --> 19:26.000]  It is a classical 360 win.
[19:26.000 --> 19:30.000]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year,
[19:30.000 --> 19:36.000]  and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.

[19:51.000 --> 19:53.000]  and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.

[19:56.000 --> 20:25.000]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z Shield and InfoWarsLive.com.
[20:27.000 --> 20:31.000]  Never! Never to see the human spirit!
[20:31.000 --> 20:35.000]  But if you can get through all that to explore what he has been saying,
[20:35.000 --> 20:40.000]  to see for yourself what it is that the establishment wants to hide from you,
[20:40.000 --> 20:44.000]  then the information you find could be life-changing.
[20:44.000 --> 20:47.000]  He predicted 9-11.
[20:47.000 --> 20:51.000]  And if there was an outside threat like a bin lad who was a known CIA asset in the 80s,
[20:51.000 --> 20:53.000]  he's the boogeyman they need.
[20:53.000 --> 20:55.000]  And it's our welly and phony system.
[20:55.000 --> 20:59.000]  He exposed the cremation of care ceremony in Bohemian Grove.
[21:06.000 --> 21:11.000]  He educated us about the relationship between the Third Reich and modern globalism.
[21:15.000 --> 21:19.000]  He helped reveal the so-called Bilderberg group at all.
[21:19.000 --> 21:28.000]  He was the loudest voice reporting on the union between the Communist Chinese and Silicon Valley.
[21:30.000 --> 21:32.000]  They falsely edited him.
[21:34.000 --> 21:37.000]  They lie about his reporting of Sandy Hook.
[21:38.000 --> 21:42.000]  They lie that he pushed a child down in a viral video.
[21:42.000 --> 21:47.000]  And now he is being de-platformed by Facebook, Apple, and Google.
[21:48.000 --> 21:53.000]  Private companies are being harassed and encouraged to stop doing business with him.
[21:53.000 --> 21:56.000]  And then we get hit and say, you no longer use our software.
[21:56.000 --> 22:00.000]  YouTubers are being censored for talking about him.
[22:00.000 --> 22:03.000]  We just got taken down by YouTube. They just killed our stream.
[22:03.000 --> 22:04.000]  Really?
[22:04.000 --> 22:05.000]  Yep.
[22:05.000 --> 22:08.000]  And some Americans are actually celebrating this.
[22:08.000 --> 22:11.000]  This is America in 2018.
[22:12.000 --> 22:18.000]  Will you sit by and allow liberty and freedom to be taken away right before your eyes?
[22:20.000 --> 22:24.000]  Will you do nothing while history is being recorded?
[22:24.000 --> 22:27.000]  Will you sit and do nothing?
[22:27.000 --> 22:34.000]  Or will you do your own research, discover the truth, and stand for freedom?
[22:34.000 --> 22:39.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[23:05.000 --> 23:11.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[23:11.000 --> 23:21.000]  Here in the United States, we are alarmed by the new calls to adopt socialism in our country.
[23:21.000 --> 23:30.000]  America was founded on liberty and independence, and not government coercion, domination, and control.
[23:30.000 --> 23:34.000]  We are born free, and we will stay free.
[23:34.000 --> 23:36.000]  We live in a republic.
[23:36.000 --> 23:47.000]  In simpler times, Plato described that as three major classes existing in an ideal state corresponding to the three parts of the soul, an equal balance of power.
[23:47.000 --> 23:55.000]  The philosophers governed the city, the soldiers defended it, and the producers grew food and created culture.
[23:55.000 --> 24:03.000]  Today, a republic is more commonly known as a state in which supreme power is held by the people.
[24:03.000 --> 24:13.000]  That power of the people is overseen by their elected representatives, and likewise, that power of the people is protected by an elected president.
[24:13.000 --> 24:19.000]  Again, three ideal classes, equally balancing the power of the people.
[24:19.000 --> 24:28.000]  But what happens when one of those ideal classes, the philosophers or the representatives, want all of that power for themselves?
[24:28.000 --> 24:33.000]  They will do anything to control it, and examples like the following ensue.
[24:33.000 --> 24:46.000]  Vanessa Tyson, a Scripps College professor in California, released a sorted account of an alleged 2004 sexual assault she endured from current Virginia Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax.
[24:46.000 --> 25:04.000]  Fairfax would assume the governor's seat if current Virginia Governor Ralph Northam steps down after dozens of Democrats have called for Northam's resignation due to his fumbling of his black-faced debacle, which was really just a distraction from his comments supporting post-birth abortion.
[25:04.000 --> 25:14.000]  Lieutenant Governor Fairfax allegedly forced Ms. Tyson to perform a sex act on him, and it didn't happen back in high school. It happened in 2004.
[25:14.000 --> 25:17.000]  So where are these Democrats now?
[25:17.000 --> 25:23.000]  We believe Dr. Lazy Ford! We believe him! We believe him!
[25:23.000 --> 25:29.000]  Dr. Ford, with what degree of certainty do you believe Brett Kavanaugh assaulted you?
[25:29.000 --> 25:31.000]  100%.
[25:31.000 --> 25:41.000]  Guess who's perpetuating all of these kinds of actions? It's the men in this country, and I just want to say to the men in this country, just shut up and step up. Do the right thing.
[25:41.000 --> 25:48.000]  I have found your testimony powerful and credible, and I believe you.
[25:48.000 --> 25:52.000]  So I want to thank you. I want to thank you for your courage, and I want to tell you I believe you.
[25:52.000 --> 26:02.000]  Well, the question is, do we value women? And that's the fundamental question. Do we believe women? Do we give them an ability to tell their story, to be heard, to have some measure of accountability?
[26:02.000 --> 26:08.000]  And, you know, sometimes it's very hard, and you have to do what's right, even when it's hard, especially when it's hard.
[26:08.000 --> 26:18.000]  The sound of crickets is deafening when a Democrat is accused of sexual assault, and the Democrat's hypocrisy never ends.
[26:18.000 --> 26:31.000]  As Jamie White reported, Virginia's Attorney General admitted to wearing blackface at a 1980 college party when he was 19 years old, marking the third high-ranking Democrat of the state to come under fire in a week.
[26:31.000 --> 26:37.000]  The irony is the fourth person in line if the Domino's fall in Virginia is a Republican.
[26:37.000 --> 26:42.000]  Meanwhile, the party of hate regurgitates its own insanity.
[26:42.000 --> 26:56.000]  We must reject the politics of revenge, resistance, and retribution, and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise, and the common good.
[26:56.000 --> 27:07.000]  I saw this as a psychotically incoherent speech with cookies and dog poop.
[27:07.000 --> 27:15.000]  He tries to put together in the same speech these warm, kind things about humanitarianism and caring about children.
[27:15.000 --> 27:26.000]  At the same time, he is demonizing people who are immigrants in a way that was a part of trafficking.
[27:26.000 --> 27:32.000]  There were people in that gallery who were children who had been torn away from their mothers at the border.
[27:32.000 --> 27:34.000]  He did not mention them.
[27:34.000 --> 27:39.000]  There were soldiers who were transgender who had been thrown out of the military.
[27:39.000 --> 27:40.000]  He didn't mention them.
[27:40.000 --> 27:47.000]  There are veterans who he has thrown out of this country who are dreamers.
[27:47.000 --> 27:49.000]  He did not mention them.
[27:49.000 --> 27:51.000]  He didn't say one positive thing.
[27:51.000 --> 27:54.000]  Listen, if you want to talk about the people he could have mentioned.
[27:54.000 --> 27:55.000]  So he's not mentioning them?
[27:55.000 --> 27:56.000]  Is it a bad speech?
[27:56.000 --> 27:58.000]  He's not mentioning everybody.
[27:58.000 --> 27:59.000]  You want him to mention them?
[27:59.000 --> 28:19.000]  Seriously, the Democratic Party may require a psychiatric evaluation in the very near future. Decisions about America's future shouldn't be in the hands of sociopaths that have created a lopsided politicized system of justice that is a very real threat to the future of our republic.
[28:19.000 --> 28:40.000]  John Bowne reporting.
[28:40.000 --> 28:59.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the Resistance. It's Alex Jones.
[28:59.000 --> 29:03.000]  Pain in my neck, back and shoulders has really gotten worse.

[33:55.000 --> 34:23.000]  As one of the most incredible cases of the corporate mainstream media, the out-of-control Robert Mueller witch hunt inquisition and the Democratic Party all working in concert to lie to the people and to violate federal law so they can set someone up and send them to prison as the cherry on top
[34:23.000 --> 34:34.000]  of the completely failed fraudulent Russiagate investigation now supposedly winding down, but they're not really doing that. They're about to just pass it on to Congress and expand the out-of-control witch hunt from there.
[34:34.000 --> 34:53.000]  We have the announcement that the House Judiciary Committee headed up by Schiff is hiring former Trump administration, securities experts, people in the national security group to then come into the committee and run the operation against the president.
[34:53.000 --> 35:04.000]  A total violation of the separation of powers from the National Security Council, completely illegal, never before seen in U.S. history. So that is all coming up.
[35:04.000 --> 35:12.000]  There's so many facets to what you're about to witness. So we're just going to talk about it in this segment and the footage.
[35:12.000 --> 35:25.000]  We're adding a Stone Defense Fund.com bug to it, an infowars.com bug to it, and blurring out the faces of the FBI agents. That's almost done. We had a computer crash earlier before the show, so we had to redo it.
[35:25.000 --> 35:30.000]  That's just the way things work, but we're going to explain why you're about to see this footage and why it's so important.
[35:30.000 --> 35:45.000]  But obviously, this is incredible because it's a felony federal and state to release a arrest warrant earlier, but Stone's gotten the documents that CNN got it the day before.
[35:45.000 --> 35:53.000]  They messed up and admitted it. These people are very incompetent. Then everybody obviously knew why was there a CNN reporter out there.
[35:53.000 --> 36:01.000]  He said, oh, he just happened to just show up randomly and the FBI didn't see him. No, he pulls in 30 minutes before. He parks there.
[36:01.000 --> 36:09.000]  They come in. They direct him. They shut the streets off. They direct him again. And at the end, right before Stone's brought out, they tell him now, leave.
[36:09.000 --> 36:20.000]  The whole thing's directed by the FBI. You've seen the FBI's footage shot by CNN. You've seen the Sinclair footage. A little bit of it leaked by somebody in Congress who had it. We're not sure yet.
[36:20.000 --> 36:31.000]  This is new footage exclusive from Roger Stone's security cameras that the FBI thought they took the hard drive for. You'll see them cover up the cameras with tape.
[36:31.000 --> 36:39.000]  You'll see them do all this because they didn't get the footage by the grace of God. And by the grace of God, we have fake news kingpins.
[36:39.000 --> 36:53.000]  CNN involved in felony actions bigger than Dallas. And this is all going to premiere for you next segment.
[36:53.000 --> 37:07.000]  But ladies and gentlemen, this is unbelievable what you're about to see because it is incontrovertible that the FBI lied, that they released the warrant early,
[37:07.000 --> 37:15.000]  that they didn't think Stone was dangerous. It was all for show, that they let CNN in, blocked the streets, directed CNN three times.
[37:15.000 --> 37:20.000]  You'll see the FBI just coming up. Looks like they're patting him on the back and then saying, get out of here.
[37:20.000 --> 37:29.000]  Right before they bring Stone out, they could all deny they ever saw each other. This is villainy. And it's caught red-handed.
[37:29.000 --> 37:37.000]  Like when somebody on those court TV shows goes, I didn't break into that house. They go, really? Here's the footage of you doing it. Or I didn't cheat on my husband.
[37:37.000 --> 37:47.000]  And then there's surveillance footage of it. This is open and shut bombshell. And it shows how fraudulent and how out of control and how political all this was.
[37:47.000 --> 37:54.000]  So let's take you now to his home, to Roger Stone to give his perspective and take on this.
[37:54.000 --> 38:02.000]  I'll have to go into the next hour, removing Gerald Salente back. He understands because then we're going to show you him being walked out in his bare feet.
[38:02.000 --> 38:07.000]  His wife being shoved, people pointing guns at him. This is all the footage they thought you wouldn't see.
[38:07.000 --> 38:16.000]  And man, if you look at the faces on these people, we're blurring them out just for, okay, someone got to be on narcotics raids and you don't want to be endangered or whatever.
[38:16.000 --> 38:21.000]  But you know what? You endangered Roger Stone and his wife and his family and everybody else being part of this fraud.
[38:21.000 --> 38:26.000]  So shame on you, but we're going to be better men than you. And we're going to blur your faces out.
[38:26.000 --> 38:30.000]  But I mean, it's not as much the SWAT team guys. They're acting like they're Cheshire cats.
[38:30.000 --> 38:40.000]  When the FBI agent, your regular ones show up, it's like they are happier than pigs and you know what? It's shocking footage.
[38:40.000 --> 38:47.000]  Shocking, shocking, shocking and very demoralizing. But you know, the good news is Congress is going to get ahold of this now.
[38:47.000 --> 38:54.000]  And they're not going to be able to hide this information. So Roger Stone, so much to cover. Thank you for joining us, my friend.
[38:54.000 --> 39:14.000]  Thank you, Alex. So essentially at exactly five o'clock as I was beginning my war room broadcast with Owen Schreuer, I learned that Sinclair Media had obtained at least some of the home surveillance camera, home security camera footage
[39:14.000 --> 39:21.000]  that my lawyers have sent to the Senate and House Judiciary Committee members.
[39:21.000 --> 39:34.000]  And since that time, the media onslaught outside my house has ramped back up. Right now there are cameras and crews from all of the networks camped outside.
[39:34.000 --> 39:52.000]  ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, Fox have all asked for copies of what people are about to see. But I sent it to you because we know how the mainstream media edits and they clips and they cleanse.
[39:52.000 --> 40:04.000]  And they don't show people the truth. Let me say from the outset that once I was taken into custody, the FBI agents treated me with complete courtesy and professionalism.
[40:04.000 --> 40:15.000]  And even during the raid, many of them looked at me and rolled their eyes as if to say, look, I'm here because I've been ordered to be here, but this is nonsense.
[40:15.000 --> 40:25.000]  But I guess the real point here is that this whole thing was unnecessary. The Special Counsel knew that I was represented by lawyers.
[40:25.000 --> 40:34.000]  They know that I don't have a valid passport. They know that you can't in Florida have both a medicinal marijuana card and a firearm. It's against the law.
[40:34.000 --> 40:47.000]  Therefore, although I strongly support the Second Amendment, I have glaucoma in my right eye from a boxing injury and a detox retina and the medicinal marijuana helps me, although I haven't used it in quite some time.
[40:47.000 --> 40:59.000]  And they know that I'm not a flight risk. That's proven by the fact that the magistrate only hours later released me on bond, essentially on my own signature, a surety bond.
[40:59.000 --> 41:09.000]  And the government did not oppose that. Exactly Roger, but I think it's important that we get into, you didn't leak this footage, somebody in the House or Senate, Judiciary Committee did.
[41:09.000 --> 41:20.000]  We need to go over the background of that. They're trying to gag you tomorrow. And then the big enchilada, CNN lied, the FBI higher ups lie, the just department line said that CNN wasn't tipped off.
[41:20.000 --> 41:27.000]  You've actually gotten the warrant. CNN was sent early. You have all the proof. And now we have the footage of the whole thing being directed.
[41:27.000 --> 41:36.000]  It looks like Steven Spielberg is out there. The FBI is directing the CNN camera person, the tripod, everything.
[41:36.000 --> 41:48.000]  That's exactly right. So here's what we know definitively. First of all, my attorney learned that I had been arrested from a CNN reporter, not from the government, not from the special counsel.
[41:48.000 --> 42:06.000]  He was informed that I had been taken into custody by a CNN reporter. That reporter sent him a copy of my indictment, which was not the official release on Pacer that was put out by the government after I had been taken into custody,
[42:06.000 --> 42:16.000]  but was an earlier draft with metadata that proved it was created the day before and written by Andrew Weisman, the pit bull for Robert Mueller.
[42:16.000 --> 42:27.000]  CNN, of course, denies everything. But what we now know from this video, Alex, is that the CNN camera crew showed up roughly 50 minutes before the FBI did.
[42:27.000 --> 42:39.000]  And they set up their tripod, which you can clearly see in their camera, roughly 25 feet from my front door, exactly nine minutes before the FBI even arrived.
[42:39.000 --> 42:53.000]  So the idea that they were operating on a hunch, and this was just a stakeout, that's a lie. Now today, CNN says, well, we've been staking, we've been staking Stone's house out every Thursday for months.
[42:53.000 --> 42:55.000]  We'll be right back.
[42:55.000 --> 43:10.000]  You're right. We'll be right back. Stay with us.

[46:35.000 --> 46:39.000]  We've already changed the world together with our laser focus.
[46:39.000 --> 46:45.000]  Do it again with hashtag Alex Jones on Twitter, on Facebook, on Google, on YouTube, everywhere.
[46:45.000 --> 46:53.000]  Call and talk radio, c-span, shout it out loud in public, hashtag Alex Jones. That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment.
[46:53.000 --> 47:16.000]  Creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit.
[47:16.000 --> 47:36.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:36.000 --> 47:46.000]  We've been working around the clock to kick us off every media platform they can. When our app went to number one in news, on Apple, it was banned.
[47:46.000 --> 47:53.000]  Not because we live, but because we tell the truth and we're bold. We have courage and we've changed the world thanks to you, the audience, this broadcast.
[47:53.000 --> 48:05.000]  Now, coming up in a few minutes, we're going to air, for TV viewers, radio listeners all describe it, raw surveillance footage out of Roger Stone's house that no one has seen.
[48:05.000 --> 48:10.000]  Now, again, if you just tuned in, you're like, wait, we all just saw this declare footage yesterday of the raid from his perspective.
[48:10.000 --> 48:17.000]  No. He gave that to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees a week ago.
[48:17.000 --> 48:26.000]  Someone there leaked it. That's a whole other story. That's only 30 seconds. We have the entire thing, all of it.
[48:26.000 --> 48:32.000]  The FBI thought they took the hard drive. They thought it was the DVR. They didn't. We have all the footage.
[48:32.000 --> 48:43.000]  We have them out on the street and you can zoom in the HD video right there with the FBI directing the cameraman, telling him what to do, everything, which is obvious.
[48:43.000 --> 48:56.000]  And metadata was received by a CNN reporter that didn't know what they were doing, sending stone emails saying, hey, respond to your indictment.
[48:56.000 --> 49:02.000]  And it shows the timestamp a day before they swat teamed him.
[49:02.000 --> 49:17.000]  So before anyone knew this happened, CNN knew this is incredible. So this shows the organized fraud, criminal level, just like Rosenstein and all these people like Comey and McCabe.
[49:17.000 --> 49:23.000]  Hell, there's grand juries out looking to indict those guys right now in Maryland and Virginia.
[49:23.000 --> 49:29.000]  That's not getting coverage, though, because they lied to Congress. The FBI is not its own branch of government.
[49:29.000 --> 49:33.000]  It's not the Praetorian Guard in the fall of Rome.
[49:33.000 --> 49:39.000]  And so it's rogue. It's not the whole FBI. And I don't just say that because, oh, don't hit me, FBI.
[49:39.000 --> 49:42.000]  I know a lot of FBI's. They're hardworking, good Christian people on average.
[49:42.000 --> 49:47.000]  But that's the low-level FBI's that shows up. If your kid gets kidnapped, there's a bank robbery.
[49:47.000 --> 49:54.000]  Or, you know, the local Muslim groups plan to bomb somebody. We're talking about the political out-of-control witch hunt group at the top.
[49:54.000 --> 49:58.000]  But they're powerful, and they're in command of the FBI.
[49:58.000 --> 50:02.000]  So it doesn't matter if some of the agents said this is a bunch of crap and rolled their eyes. Obviously they know that.
[50:02.000 --> 50:07.000]  The point is to still follow in orders, bro. Don't cut it. And that's the point we've gotten to in this country.
[50:07.000 --> 50:12.000]  So, Roger, we're going to start getting to this footage. And I'm not even trying to build this up.
[50:12.000 --> 50:18.000]  But literally, they're shutting down all our Facebooks, all our Twitter's, fan pages, everything.
[50:18.000 --> 50:20.000]  It's happened to you so that we can't get out to people.
[50:20.000 --> 50:23.000]  So before we air this footage, we'll do the whole next hour on this.
[50:23.000 --> 50:27.000]  Firing up the Bat Signal Drudge has been very smart and cares about real news.
[50:27.000 --> 50:32.000]  When you gave your world exclusive before the press conference and your second press conference, he carried it.
[50:32.000 --> 50:39.000]  And those were important. Those dwarf. I mean, this is 50 times, in my view, more important than those.
[50:39.000 --> 50:46.000]  This is the raw footage and then zoomed in of the FBI conferring.
[50:46.000 --> 50:51.000]  Not once, not twice, but three times with a reporter who's set up right at the front of your driveway.
[50:51.000 --> 50:55.000]  They block the streets. They come in. They direct him. They come back in. We're going to show it all.
[50:55.000 --> 50:59.000]  Then we're going to show the shocking footage of you and your wife.
[50:59.000 --> 51:05.000]  The shock. I mean, it's shocking. And I wish I could show their faces because, you know, the paramilitary guys are all serious.
[51:05.000 --> 51:10.000]  But then the regular FBI agents look like Yogi Bear or something. It's like they're at a picnic or something.
[51:10.000 --> 51:15.000]  And it just want to be and they're all slap each other on the back and it's they're setting up their tent.
[51:15.000 --> 51:20.000]  And I mean, it's just riveting, riveting behind the scenes footage.
[51:20.000 --> 51:25.000]  And you're seeing exclusive screenshots right now from info wars.com and news wars.com.
[51:25.000 --> 51:31.000]  But I'm going to stop here because the hour is almost over and we haven't talked about stone defense fund.com.
[51:31.000 --> 51:37.000]  And believe me, I know about lawyers, our lawyer bills. I don't want to tell the enemy what the lawyer bills were the last 12 months.
[51:37.000 --> 51:42.000]  I think I'm very happy and but we've had some big successes. Just got text messages, but just won two big things in court.
[51:42.000 --> 51:48.000]  You'll never see them out of the news. Problem is I won like 15 of these suits. They just filed five more, but we're winning those.
[51:48.000 --> 51:54.000]  But I'm in a knockdown drag out and folks, I've got the crew. I've got the will. I've got the people to keep the fight going.
[51:54.000 --> 52:00.000]  But I'm telling you, you've got to tell everyone tune into info wars.com forward slash show right now.
[52:00.000 --> 52:04.000]  You've got to when these videos go up so people can see what happened to Roger.
[52:04.000 --> 52:09.000]  They won't let us put it on YouTube or anywhere else. You know, it's super newsworthy because, you know, we're the fake news people.
[52:09.000 --> 52:15.000]  They say, no, we're the real news people. Folks always say, wouldn't somebody stand up? Why don't they exist?
[52:15.000 --> 52:23.000]  We're going to upload all this info wars.com the next 30 minutes. We're going to stream it live coming up next segment.
[52:23.000 --> 52:35.000]  Right at info wars.com. You know, the front page info wars.com says global exclusive FBI directed CNN crew at Stone raid.
[52:35.000 --> 52:40.000]  It's all there. Nobody bought their lives. We know that. But here's the deal. They've been caught.
[52:40.000 --> 52:46.000]  And it shows if one part of investigation breaks the law as a fraud, all of it's over. But they've done it and done it and done it.
[52:46.000 --> 52:55.000]  There's no Russia gate. The crime is trying to reach out and get WikiLeaks on. Everybody was trying that.
[52:55.000 --> 53:01.000]  I mean, hell's CNN and the New York Times were talking to Goose for 2.0. We weren't other than text messages.
[53:01.000 --> 53:08.000]  So yeah, we're journalists. It's what we do. We get big scoops time and time again. And that's my crime is we're dogged.
[53:08.000 --> 53:16.000]  So I need your financial support if you want this operation to I'm about to pull trigger on expanding or say back this off over a year.
[53:16.000 --> 53:24.000]  We've been behind or contracting because there's no stay the same size. And I've got to make decisions here and be judicious about this.
[53:24.000 --> 53:33.000]  I've always only expanded in the in the face of a fight. There's a scorpion song about that. I forget the name, but it don't stop at the top.
[53:33.000 --> 53:40.000]  They will come in the start of hour two or six after that. But I think it's in the player in there.
[53:40.000 --> 53:51.000]  So that's what this is all about is doing the right thing and not being whims and actually measuring up to our forebearers and being Americans and acting like what Americans were known for instead of what we've turned into.
[53:51.000 --> 54:02.000]  So I make it easy at infowarstore.com. We have the best nutraceuticals, the best ultimate bone broth, 50% off the best FDA approved super silver.
[54:02.000 --> 54:09.000]  Nobody else has got this. We've got 50% off and you get the combo of that because I don't people need it right now in the winter with all the stuff that's going on.
[54:09.000 --> 54:15.000]  Brain force, the amazing new tropic. We just went out and looked at top brands that were 60 70 bucks and said let's make it even stronger.
[54:15.000 --> 54:20.000]  See, I don't reinvent the wheel. It's top selling has five stars. Everybody loves it. Test is clean.
[54:20.000 --> 54:28.000]  I go, what's the markup on that other marketed up five times. Okay, well, let's make it even stronger and only market up 150% and then discount at 50%.
[54:28.000 --> 54:36.000]  And I believe people will recognize that. We'll want that. Well, 50% offer basically I haven't made any money on it, but I want you to try.
[54:36.000 --> 54:48.000]  It's it's it's it's it's it's kissing cousin, you could say, and that would be the turbo force that's beyond energy drink replacement beyond pre workout beyond anything.
[54:48.000 --> 54:57.000]  You better take half a pack the first time you take it because it's got all the synergistic minerals and vitamins and cofactors and amino acids that upload it in a wide spectrum of known mother nature.
[54:57.000 --> 55:02.000]  Based energy that absolutely delivers it like nothing you've experienced.
[55:02.000 --> 55:07.000]  Hell, there's only, you know, one review for the combo pack is it just got launched a week ago.
[55:07.000 --> 55:16.000]  But if you read just on turbo force, it's already got hundreds of reviews, five star reviews in full wars life.com or triple a 253 313.
[55:16.000 --> 55:27.000]  Now, but whatever you do, commit to the fight in an Alexandra Cortes, a socialist, eat their dogs, capitalist, walk them. That's the best seller and pray for us and support those local AMF affiliates.
[55:27.000 --> 55:32.000]  Now, Roger, you're going to have the floor and we get back and we're going to play all the footage, but I I rule people know this is a big deal.
[55:32.000 --> 55:41.000]  Like you're we're not making friends with stuff like this. They're going to try to gag you tomorrow. You weren't going to release this until they they they leaked at the Senate.
[55:41.000 --> 55:46.000]  We're going to talk about it all. But first off, I know the listeners have already come through great. We appreciate them.
[55:46.000 --> 55:51.000]  And, you know, you're employed here. That helps you some. But I know what those bills are like. You're having to move out of your house, move into apartment.
[55:51.000 --> 55:56.000]  You told me you got a lot of other stuff going on. I know how much money it takes to fight Goliath.
[55:56.000 --> 56:04.000]  So people really should go to stone defense fund.com, make a donation. They should go to stone cold truth.com and get a Roger Stone did nothing wrong.
[56:04.000 --> 56:15.000]  Sure, they should understand that that we have been picked for destruction so that once we're destroyed, they can steal our identity once we're gagged and make us into the demons they claimed we were.
[56:15.000 --> 56:19.000]  They've written us into their script. And it's important we break out of it.
[56:19.000 --> 56:32.000]  That's exactly right, Alex. And as I've said many times, the survival of info wars is absolutely crucial to my strategy to win this case, because this is the only place where you can get that stone cold truth where you can get all of it,
[56:32.000 --> 56:46.000]  because we they don't edit, we don't censor, we don't hide things. So I appreciate the thousands of my supporters in the info wars community who are buying great products at the info wars.com site in giving to my legal
[56:46.000 --> 57:03.000]  defense fund at stone defense fund.com. You can get my books at the info wars.com site in the store at a better price than you can get them. You can give to me directly to pay for my incredibly expensive but very effective lawyers at stone defense fund.com.
[57:03.000 --> 57:17.000]  We're in this fight together, but the chances of my surviving without a vibrant, robust info wars out there where people can see it are almost nailed. So please, folks, support us both. We all need your support.
[57:17.000 --> 57:22.000]  Roger, I don't think I'm going to tell you about the most chilling experience of my entire life.
[57:22.000 --> 57:34.000]  When we're going to break, Roger, we come back and do that. Everyone, whether it's on AM FM, TV, internet, right now, we got the FBI directing and working with the CNN reporter. We caught evil CNN red handed.
[57:34.000 --> 57:58.000]  This is epic, but we got to push it through now through the sensors, the live feed info wars.com forward slash show right now. Ladies and gentlemen, it's about to break right now on the other side. Our two only two minutes away. Stay with us.
[57:58.000 --> 58:07.000]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[58:07.000 --> 58:17.000]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burnout in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[58:17.000 --> 58:28.000]  We have developed hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre workout and beyond system in the world. There's nothing else like it.
[58:28.000 --> 58:36.000]  You must experience it. It is a total game changer and it comes in easy to use, packaged, mixed in fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[58:36.000 --> 58:50.000]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong. It lasts 10 hours. So take a half pack the first time you take it because turbo force is named turbo force because it will take you into overdrive turbo force and enforce live.com.
[58:50.000 --> 59:11.000]  At M4s, we're always looking for the very best, best selling highest rated products that we can then private label and sell. Well, there is a national company who has FDA approval to sell their wound gel that is the strongest out there and we private label it and we sell it for $10 less online than they sell it at CVS and Walgreens.
[59:11.000 --> 59:29.000]  We also have another product also produced by the same company, immune gargle. We've been selling a lot of the wound gel and a lot of the immune gargle.

[59:59.000 --> 1:00:07.580]  The Alex Jones show because there is a war on for your mind
[1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:41.000]  You never take things away, but when this blows straight into your face
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:49.000]  You never ever close your eyes for any trouble that may cross your way
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:56.000]  That's the risk that you're not taking, not the mountain that's too high
[1:00:56.000 --> 1:01:00.000]  Spread your wings, you're gonna make it to the best time of your life
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:03.000]  We kicked Hillary out
[1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:07.000]  We're getting nationalists elected everywhere
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:10.000]  We're catching corporate media and lies every day
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:12.000]  Humanity's waking up
[1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:16.000]  The Democrats are openly saying they support killing babies after they're born
[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:20.000]  The energy level of humanity is surging against this
[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  I've got my finger on the pulse
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:28.000]  But at the same time, those of us that are at the tip of the spear have to pay the piper
[1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  But everything we have in civilization is because other men and women paid the piper
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:39.000]  And I'm not a sadist, I don't like pain, I don't like punishment
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:43.000]  I just can't back down to criminals
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:47.000]  So we're living in an epic time, ladies and gentlemen, Roger Stump stations don't care this first five minutes
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:51.000]  We are plunging into it next segment, I haven't been building this up
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:55.000]  There's been issues and things obviously with all this HD video getting it ready
[1:01:55.000 --> 1:01:58.000]  But we've got it all ready now and all prepared
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:03.000]  I just want to be able to review it and that takes time during breaks
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:07.000]  So I've been working during little three and four minute, two minute breaks
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:15.000]  But we have some major breaking news that just adds cherry and nuts and chocolate sauce onto this Sunday
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  We'll play after the break, but Whittaker's come out and said that
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  That's actually turning general and congressional testimony, we have the footage
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:27.000]  Deeply concerned that CNN was at Roger Stone raid and now they're already calling for hearings
[1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:31.000]  And Mueller's group has already lied and said they weren't involved
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:35.000]  Even though we have the metadata that you got and the footage now
[1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  These guys are really arrogant and now I think they're in a lot of trouble, Roger
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:48.000]  Well, the irony, of course, Alex, is CNN is now attempting to say that there's nothing extraordinary here
[1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:54.000]  That they've been staking out my house every Friday starting late Thursday night for months
[1:02:54.000 --> 1:03:02.000]  Of course, the security camera video that we have proved that that is yet another bald-faced lie from CNN
[1:03:02.000 --> 1:03:07.000]  There's just no question that the security camera footage that people are about to see
[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:13.000]  Clearly shows CNN showing up roughly 50 minutes before the raid on my home
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:20.000]  It shows them setting up their camera tripod almost exactly nine minutes before the FBI arrives
[1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:27.000]  17 vehicles, two of them armored vehicles, two amphibious units in the backyard
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:35.000]  Because I live on a canal, a helicopter overhead, 29 agents wearing night vision goggles
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:43.000]  Attired in swat gear, armored vests, all carrying assault weapons and side arms
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:50.000]  A huge metal device they use for bashing in the door in the unlikely event that I wouldn't open it
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:52.000]  It's a ram, it's a battered ram
[1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:56.000]  Yeah, this had to cost the taxpayers a half million dollars
[1:03:56.000 --> 1:04:00.000]  When they simply could have contacted my attorneys and I would have like everybody else
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:04.000]  Mr. Mueller has indicted turned myself in voluntarily
[1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:11.000]  This was a show put on to poison the jury pool to make me look guilty before I've had a chance to prove my innocence
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:16.000]  And Roger, now we've caught Mueller, I mean the FBI's on record, the Mueller probe saying we didn't tip them off
[1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:21.000]  But they messed up and gave you metadata, but they sent the warrant on a day before, that's a felony
[1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  And now they've been caught and now there's an investigation and when people see the footage
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:29.000]  Not the footage that got released when they raided him from CNN
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:36.000]  Not the footage that Sinclair just got leaked, a little bit of it that Roger was sent to the Judiciary Committees
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:42.000]  No, the full footage, both raw and blown up, because we zoom in on this

[1:06:07.000 --> 1:06:31.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones
[1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:39.000]  All right, Roger Stone, infowars.com investigative journalist, he's written New York Times bestselling books on the Kennedy assassination, you name it
[1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:44.000]  That's how I got to know him, years ago interviewing about Kennedy, and then meeting him at a Kennedy event
[1:06:44.000 --> 1:06:50.000]  And then I met him a couple years before Trump won the election, became good friends
[1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:57.000]  And now I've watched him caught up in the Mueller investigation, and then there's no Russiagate, they're just claiming that he
[1:06:57.000 --> 1:07:03.000]  I tried to talk to WikiLeaks, which everybody admits we did, like everybody else did
[1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:09.000]  It's amazing, and then Roger gets raided, CNN's there
[1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:14.000]  I talked to Owen Schreuer and our crew, and I said, can you get on the plane tonight?
[1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:20.000]  They got there the night of the raid, incredibly
[1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:25.000]  And we're there, and I was saying, Roger, I want your surveillance footage
[1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:30.000]  You said they took everything, they took all the DVRs, everything's a wreck here, I have no computers, no equipment
[1:07:30.000 --> 1:07:35.000]  Well, Roger will tell you the timeline, but later, they go, what's this DVR?
[1:07:35.000 --> 1:07:43.000]  And it's the raid, the FBI thought they'd taken it, they put tape over the cameras and the videos, and you watch it
[1:07:43.000 --> 1:07:48.000]  And it's watching a crime in progress, a big political stunt
[1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:54.000]  The warrant being leaked to the media, CNN messes up, asking Roger questions and sends him the warrant
[1:07:54.000 --> 1:08:00.000]  And again, they're like building their own traps for themselves, just like the Bible says
[1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:07.000]  And so, quite frankly, I'm arguing with Roger, I'm like, hey listen, you know, I think that judge, if she's going to gag you, she's going to gag you
[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:09.000]  And I just think you ought to put the footage out
[1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:12.000]  Well, I haven't really seen it, the lawyers have it, it's being handled
[1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:16.000]  I'm just too busy here trying to keep a float
[1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:20.000]  And so, okay, well if you're going to release that footage, I hope we get some of the explosives
[1:08:20.000 --> 1:08:23.000]  That's what I'm all about, I'm a news organization
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:31.000]  And then, I'm at the office five o'clock last night, and I'm actually in the control room where they're doing the war room
[1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:37.000]  Because I mean, they're talking about news and a shoot I'm going to do in the next studio in like an hour
[1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:39.000]  And all of a sudden they go, hey, have you seen this?
[1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:47.000]  And it's Sinclair broadcasting with this footage that for whatever reason they night visioned out and made it look black and white to look cooler
[1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:49.000]  It's color video
[1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:53.000]  And they put all this stuff around it and do a bunch of weird stuff
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:59.000]  And I'm sitting there looking at this and then Rodgers on air while they're telling him
[1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:03.000]  And he's like, I don't know, I don't know, I gotta get off air here, I gotta go
[1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:08.000]  Well, by the time Rodgers figured out what was going on, it was late last night, so I talked to him this morning
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:15.000]  And the reason this is a big deal is, his lawyers probably rightfully said, look, this judge already gagged a bunch of people
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:21.000]  He's in Mueller's pocket, but your profession is talking and writing so they shouldn't be able to stop you if not we're going to appeal it obviously
[1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:29.000]  But let's not release this footage, let's just give it to Congress so there's a copy there with the judiciary committee that's already investigating this
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:32.000]  Because there are opening investigations of the raid and the Senate especially
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:37.000]  So they send it to him uploaded with the way they want and then all of a sudden we're blindsided, that's a whole other thing
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  Who leaked this to Sinclair?
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:42.000]  So that's a whole other thing, it's not us
[1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:47.000]  Because I knew Roger had it, so Roger rushes, well, Roger, we'll get this footage here in a moment, but everybody needs to understand
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:56.000]  This needs to be built up, like the Super Bowl, this is CNN caught red-handed with Mueller's rogue FBI splinter group
[1:09:56.000 --> 1:10:02.000]  I mean, I hope it's a splinter group, Whitaker is, you know, decrying it right now, and I want to think they're telling the truth
[1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:07.000]  This is just sensational, this is showing people hand in the cookie jar
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:12.000]  Or, you know, the footage where the serial killer strangles the woman, I mean, you don't get out of this, what we're about to show
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:17.000]  But just walk through why this is so important, because you're having that hearing tomorrow to gag you, and we've talked about this
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:23.000]  We both think they're going to try to use whoever leaked this against you, when they're the ones that already leaked it
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:31.000]  Well, Alex, this could conceivably be my last interview on Info Wars, at least for a while, we just don't know
[1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:40.000]  I do have a First Amendment right to defend myself, and the argument that I should be gagged because my talking in defense of myself
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:50.000]  might poison a potential jury pool, well, the government just poisoned the jury pool by staging this incredible over-the-top Gestapo-type raid on my home
[1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:56.000]  And by, you know, by making sure that CNN was there to record all of it
[1:10:56.000 --> 1:11:03.000]  So, look, I didn't leak this tape, it was sent to the proper authorities, I'm grateful to Senator Lindsey Graham
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  I'm grateful to the Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee, who are looking into exactly what happened here
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:19.000]  But the Sinclair footage is severely truncated, you can see the CNN crew in the background, but they're not clearly identified
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:26.000]  That's why it was essential for Info Wars to open this whole thing up and get to the bottom of it and lay it out for people
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:36.000]  Because it's chilling, and it cost the taxpayers, who knows, a half million dollars unnecessarily to try to depict me like some kind of drug kingpin
[1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:47.000]  Like I'm El Chapo, or Pablo Escobar, trying to make me look like a criminal before I've had a chance to assert my innocence in a court of law
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:55.000]  So, I'm grateful to Info Wars and Alex, your courage, being willing to show the American people what really went down that day
[1:11:55.000 --> 1:12:00.000]  That's right, we're showing Sinclair's version right now, I don't know why they made it black and white, it looked more scary
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:06.000]  We're going to show you the real footage, and CNN will go, oh, it's edited, they've learned the FBI people's faces
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:12.000]  No, that's not doctored, that's not, that's not substantially changed, boring faces is not changing the truth of it
[1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:17.000]  In fact, zooming in and blowing it up isn't doing that, but I guarantee you, they're going to try to ignore this, Roger
[1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:24.000]  And they're going to try to say that we've altered it, none of that's true, in a doctored form
[1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:32.000]  We are showing you so you can zoom in and see the FBI, patting them on the back, directing them, doing it all with a CNN guy, they say they knew nothing about
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  BS, they blocked both sides of the streets, he was already there waiting, they talked to him, they let him stay there
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:44.000]  What you don't do on this kind of, quote, felony raid like they did, and then they direct him to leave at the end
[1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:51.000]  So that they don't have the Roger Stone being brought out part, they thought that would probably be too much and too obvious and it would look like the FBI staged it
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  They put a lot of thought at the Mueller level, I think Mueller made the decisions on how this was done, Roger
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:13:01.000]  Well, let me explain the difference between the black and white and the color
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:10.000]  Remember this pre dawn raid began in the dark, and therefore the security cameras operate on infrared, that's why the images are black and white
[1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:13.000]  Oh, then later it turns, it turns color
[1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:19.000]  Exactly, so that is what has transpired, what I want to know is, who approved this?
[1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:26.000]  Did the FBI director Christopher Ray approve this? Did the acting attorney general Matthew Whitaker approve this?
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  Did the station chief of the FBI in Miami, a guy named Piero, who's known for these kind of brutal tactics
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  Did he approve this? Did Mr. Mueller order this? How far up the chain of command did it go?
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:42.000]  These are the questions I think Senator Graham should be asking
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:48.000]  These are the questions that Matt Gaetz and Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows, all good men, should be asking
[1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:56.000]  And let's be clear, as I predict as you predicted, they've heated up 84 investigations
[1:13:56.000 --> 1:14:07.000]  Mueller's fake investigation probably is going to end in the next month, like they say, but it'll all then metastasize into all these other cancers to use an accurate term
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:15.000]  I mean, Trump needs to take action, he has them with this raid, with CNN, haul these FBI people in, who ordered him to do that?
[1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:20.000]  Who told him CNN could be in the middle of a raid? This thing's in now
[1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:25.000]  Well, Alex, you know the worst part of this, I'm a tough guy like you, you know, I'm a fighter
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:32.000]  My poor wife is 73 years old, she's hearing impaired, she's a beautiful woman and she's in great shape
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:36.000]  But why she was treated like this? Why she was aroused out in the middle of the night?
[1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:43.000]  Why she's made to stand in her bare feet in the middle of the street when she's been charged with no crime?
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:49.000]  Why she can't call or return calls from my grandchildren or my children, trying to call and see if grandma is all right?
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:52.000]  That's just outrageous, that's abusive
[1:14:52.000 --> 1:14:57.000]  And then, you know, as you know, her family fled Fidel Castro's gulag
[1:14:57.000 --> 1:15:08.000]  So to accuse us of being Russian dupes or Russian spies, when my family was crushed by Russian tanks in Budapest in 1956, that is the height of an insult
[1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:13.000]  That's as insulting as it gets. No, it's the Clintons who are colluding with the Russians
[1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:20.000]  It's Bill and Hillary and then uranium one and their cohort Robert Muller, they're the ones who were engaged in treason
[1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:24.000]  Jamie Ray headed up the cover up at her foundation and she's one of the prosecutors
[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:29.000]  This has never been done before, this is literally Fox's running the hen house
[1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:35.000]  Absolutely, Alex, and look, I'm glad that you have the courage to show everything
[1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:40.000]  Because there is no other media outlet in America that has that kind of courage
[1:15:40.000 --> 1:15:47.000]  You're not going to see this on CNN or ABC or NBC or CBS or even Sinclair
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:52.000]  I think they're good people at Sinclair, but they gave you a little tiny snippet of what happened
[1:15:52.000 --> 1:15:57.000]  This is the only place on the planet where you can see the truth
[1:15:57.000 --> 1:16:04.000]  Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon you'll need a plan and place to survive
[1:16:04.000 --> 1:16:07.000]  Get bunkers, you're not a live underground gopher

[1:18:55.000 --> 1:19:22.000]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship and I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most varied, the most suppressed
[1:19:22.000 --> 1:19:26.000]  I've ever heard when Trump won, they don't want us to have that victory
[1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:30.000]  They don't want us to remember what political action did
[1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:34.000]  And that's why the globalist Hillary and others are trying to shut in for us now
[1:19:34.000 --> 1:19:41.000]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech, about taking your very sovereignty away

[1:20:48.000 --> 1:20:54.000]  We're also going to upload the raw footage as we speak to that page on infowarst.com
[1:20:54.000 --> 1:21:01.000]  I cannot overstate the importance of what you're about to see
[1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:08.000]  Roger Stone acting AG Whitaker fuels flimsy conspiracy theory, that's Vox that calls for total censorship
[1:21:08.000 --> 1:21:15.000]  That Mueller tipped off CNN about Stone's arrest when you even got them sending you emails with metadata
[1:21:15.000 --> 1:21:21.000]  They've been sending indictment the day before and then acting AG Whitaker deeply concerned that CNN was at Roger Stone raid
[1:21:21.000 --> 1:21:28.000]  And now this is the center of hearings today, right as they're having the hearings, we couldn't have planned this better, we didn't
[1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:34.000]  You just sent it on to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees as a good citizen
[1:21:34.000 --> 1:21:40.000]  Somebody leaks out the weakest part of it to Sinclair, but now this is all starting to unfold, this is huge Roger
[1:21:40.000 --> 1:21:50.000]  Well, and I'm told that Senator Collins from Maine questioned the FBI director today as to why CNN was permitted to be on the scene
[1:21:50.000 --> 1:22:00.000]  If I was theoretically dangerous, which is the whole premise of their raid on my home, then why was a CNN camera crew allowed to set up 25 feet from my front door
[1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:07.000]  My neighbors who were walking their dogs were told to go back in their homes because it was a dangerous situation
[1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:13.000]  The street was sealed off to all traffic, so why was CNN allowed to stay there
[1:22:13.000 --> 1:22:18.000]  And CNN's claim that they staked out my house every Friday for months is a lie
[1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:24.000]  I have security camera footage that proves yet again that CNN is lying
[1:22:24.000 --> 1:22:31.000]  Wolf Blitzer, Jake Tapper, Sarah Murray, these people are busted, they're not journalists, they're just liars
[1:22:31.000 --> 1:22:37.000]  Now they'll hide behind their journalistic privileges, but the government doesn't allow that
[1:22:37.000 --> 1:22:49.000]  So Mr. Muller, Mr. Weissman, the FBI director, Mr. Ray, Mr. Piero in Miami, they need to be questioned under oath about why the CNN crew was there
[1:22:49.000 --> 1:22:58.000]  Why they showed up 40-50 minutes before the raid and why they were allowed to set up their tripod exactly 9 minutes before I was taken away
[1:22:58.000 --> 1:23:04.000]  And you have the FBI, you can see the whole setup, we're about to go to it, but let's play Attorney General Whitaker from earlier today
[1:23:04.000 --> 1:23:10.000]  Saying he is concerned obviously about this, because it violates federal law, tipping people off about raids and warrants
[1:23:10.000 --> 1:23:12.000]  It's very illegal, here it is
[1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:20.000]  Are you familiar from public reports or otherwise that a CNN reporter was camped out outside of Stone's house when the FBI arrested him?
[1:23:20.000 --> 1:23:22.000]  Thank you
[1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:26.000]  This wouldn't be part of the investigation
[1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:32.000]  I am aware of that and it was deeply concerning to me as to how CNN found out about that
[1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:34.000]  I'm glad we're going down that road
[1:23:34.000 --> 1:23:41.000]  Did somebody at the Department of Justice seemingly share a draft indictment with CNN prior to Stone's arrest?
[1:23:41.000 --> 1:23:44.000]  Or prior to a grand jury's finding of a true bill?
[1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:58.000]  Ranking Member Collins, the court had a sealed indictment that after Mr. Stone's arrest was unsealed
[1:23:58.000 --> 1:24:11.000]  Consistent with all its prior indictments, the DOJ's basic policy for transparency in criminal cases is that the indictment is posted on the DOJ webpage promptly after it's unsealed
[1:24:11.000 --> 1:24:15.000]  And then media outlets were notified
[1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:27.000]  We do not know of any, and I do not know of any other special counsel's office notice or DOJ notice to media outlets regarding Mr. Stone's indictment or his arrest
[1:24:27.000 --> 1:24:34.000]  Otherwise, I really, as I sit here today, don't have any other information that I can talk about regarding Mr. Stone
[1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:41.000]  But Roger Stone does have that, we'll cover that next segment, but Roger, you can smell it, like the Whitaker
[1:24:41.000 --> 1:24:51.000]  All of this, you can see that they know what's happening, we see all these criminal recommendations from the Inspector General of the Justice Department
[1:24:51.000 --> 1:24:55.000]  That FBI agents have been involved in criminal activity against Trump, against you, against others
[1:24:55.000 --> 1:25:00.000]  This is a leftist cabal, it must be rooted out, I think we're getting very close to it, Roger
[1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:07.000]  Well, as you know yesterday, Apple agreed to hand over my passwords to the Mueller investigative team
[1:25:07.000 --> 1:25:16.000]  Now, they refuse to turn over the passwords for the Pulse nightclub shooter, or for the San Bernardino mass murderer, because they wanted to protect their privacy rights
[1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:24.000]  The reason I suspect they want my Apple ID is to see whether I destroyed any evidence or erased any files, the answer is no
[1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:34.000]  Mr. Mueller, however, did erase the text messages of Mr. Page, pardon me, of Mr. Stroke and Lisa Page, which is, of course, destruction of evidence
[1:25:34.000 --> 1:25:41.000]  So there's a walking indictment right there, Mr. Whitaker, what are you waiting for? Or is it okay for them to destroy evidence?
[1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:45.000]  I have destroyed nothing, I have erased nothing
[1:25:45.000 --> 1:25:51.000]  The records that they examine will be identical to the records they already have, 3 terabytes of data
[1:25:51.000 --> 1:25:57.000]  But if the government thinks that they're not going to be able to hide the fact that they had me under surveillance in 2016
[1:25:57.000 --> 1:26:04.000]  That they had an illegal warrant to surveil me during Donald Trump's presidential campaign
[1:26:04.000 --> 1:26:11.000]  That they were eavesdropping on my conversations with candidate Trump, they're not going to be able to hide the ball, although they're going to try
[1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:18.000]  The New York Times reported that on January 20th, 2017, you were with me that day in Washington, Alex, we blew our minds
[1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:24.000]  The New York Times refuses to retract that story, the reporter insists it was correct and is correct
[1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:29.000]  Why was I being spied on in 2016? We're going to get to the bottom of all of this
[1:26:29.000 --> 1:26:33.000]  And again, I've not been building this up here for the last 45 minutes without getting the footage
[1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:38.000]  There's just so many angles and who leaked it and now you're about to see the real footage
[1:26:38.000 --> 1:26:49.000]  And as we speak, I told Rob do 15 minutes ago, we've got the raw footage and then we've got it blown up of the FBI, literally like Stanley Kubrick or Steven Spielberg
[1:26:49.000 --> 1:26:56.000]  There, or James Cameron directing, or I mean so many other directors, directing all that
[1:26:56.000 --> 1:27:01.000]  It's like you're watching, oh that's a TV crew, who are those, oh that's the director, they're telling him what to do
[1:27:01.000 --> 1:27:08.000]  The whole thing, the whole setup, which is just fantastical, we're going to go to break and of the Waterloo and Roswell Bear Creek
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:14.000]  Next segment we'll show the raw footage and then we speed it up because it's 30 minutes of them sitting there and then we'll give you the blown up footage
[1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:20.000]  But it's all being uploaded at infowars.com and newswars.com and prisonplanet.com, please folks, understand
[1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:27.000]  They don't want a free and independent media in America, they don't want groups and organizations that are willing to stand up and tell the truth
[1:27:27.000 --> 1:27:35.000]  They want a bunch of yes men, we're not that, but the power, I'm willing to go all the way against the globalists
[1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:42.000]  I believe we can win, we've already had big victories, but they know that info wars is a flash point, a focal point, a launch point, a rallying point
[1:27:42.000 --> 1:27:49.000]  A signet, a standard, a flag of freedom and will and what's left of Americana
[1:27:49.000 --> 1:27:56.000]  But that little fire of info wars has already set giant fires and they're dealing with those fires right now and they're worried
[1:27:56.000 --> 1:28:04.000]  That we're going to set new brush fires, the minds of men and women, yes we are, but only you can feel the sales, you are the info wars
[1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:14.000]  So spread the live links at infowars.com, spread the live link, global exclusive, FBI directed the raid on Stone's house with CNN

[1:34:02.000 --> 1:34:04.000]  Whatever you do, realize it's a fight
[1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:09.000]  And I keep reminding you, I know a lot of you are out there hammering hard and taking action
[1:34:09.000 --> 1:34:11.000]  I'm just telling those that passively tune in
[1:34:11.000 --> 1:34:14.000]  This is history, ladies and gentlemen
[1:34:14.000 --> 1:34:18.000]  And I bet on the American people, I bet that you'd want to be free
[1:34:18.000 --> 1:34:21.000]  I bet that you'd want jobs back, I bet that you wanted to have a good future
[1:34:21.000 --> 1:34:26.000]  I sure know I do, and I bet that you'd see people ridiculed, lied about, you'd see through it
[1:34:26.000 --> 1:34:29.000]  And a lot of you have, but I think there's just so much media out there
[1:34:29.000 --> 1:34:31.000]  Sometimes people just don't get that
[1:34:31.000 --> 1:34:33.000]  Everybody's trying to act like they're the tip of the spear
[1:34:33.000 --> 1:34:35.000]  And hell I wish they were, we wouldn't be in this trouble
[1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:37.000]  We are the tip of the spear
[1:34:37.000 --> 1:34:40.000]  I've been banging heads with the Globals for 25 years
[1:34:40.000 --> 1:34:42.000]  On air 24
[1:34:42.000 --> 1:34:44.000]  In the last decade, man, I've been over the target
[1:34:44.000 --> 1:34:47.000]  Because of having a big powerful audience
[1:34:47.000 --> 1:34:48.000]  And that's what they fear, they fear you
[1:34:48.000 --> 1:34:51.000]  This attack is about taking your life over
[1:34:51.000 --> 1:34:54.000]  So, without further ado, Roger Stone
[1:34:54.000 --> 1:34:58.000]  We're going to start airing the audio, you know, free video
[1:34:58.000 --> 1:35:02.000]  Of what happened, and then get to the exclusive raid footage and more
[1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:06.000]  But again, I don't want it's bad you being handcuffed and your wife and all the rest of it
[1:35:06.000 --> 1:35:08.000]  And that's pretty powerful footage and it's exclusive
[1:35:08.000 --> 1:35:11.000]  But the CNN, as you pointed out on the phone to me this morning
[1:35:11.000 --> 1:35:14.000]  That's really what's so incredible here
[1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:18.000]  Showing that Mueller lied, showing they lied
[1:35:18.000 --> 1:35:21.000]  Of course, showing that they illegally leaked this to CNN
[1:35:21.000 --> 1:35:24.000]  As you have the metadata, so you have them in the Attorney General
[1:35:24.000 --> 1:35:26.000]  The Acting Attorney General says he's pretty upset about this
[1:35:26.000 --> 1:35:29.000]  So this is really pertinent information right now
[1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:32.000]  That's essential to exposing the deep state
[1:35:32.000 --> 1:35:37.000]  Well, evidently, the Acting Attorney General said he's willing to address the overuse of force
[1:35:37.000 --> 1:35:40.000]  In a closed hearing, but not in public
[1:35:40.000 --> 1:35:43.000]  That's the problem with this whole investigation
[1:35:43.000 --> 1:35:45.000]  Everything is being done behind closed doors
[1:35:45.000 --> 1:35:48.000]  I wanted to testify before the House Intelligence Committee
[1:35:48.000 --> 1:35:52.000]  In open session for the TV cameras, it was not allowed
[1:35:52.000 --> 1:35:55.000]  Adam Schiff lied in that hearing again and again and again
[1:35:55.000 --> 1:35:58.000]  Mr. Schiff will be on the stand at my trial
[1:35:58.000 --> 1:36:01.000]  Eric Swalwell will be on the stand in my trial
[1:36:01.000 --> 1:36:03.000]  Congressman, put aside about a day and a half
[1:36:03.000 --> 1:36:06.000]  Because we got a lot of questions for you under oath
[1:36:06.000 --> 1:36:08.000]  Some of you haven't experienced in a while
[1:36:08.000 --> 1:36:10.000]  No more congressional immunity, dude
[1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:13.000]  We need to know all about what you have done
[1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:18.000]  And why you handled the inquiries from the Russians the way you did
[1:36:18.000 --> 1:36:20.000]  Trying to sell you naked pictures of the President
[1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:22.000]  Alex, let's get to this footage
[1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:24.000]  My heart is in my throat here
[1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:27.000]  I had trouble watching this, to be honest with you
[1:36:27.000 --> 1:36:29.000]  When the lawyer showed it to me
[1:36:29.000 --> 1:36:32.000]  Interestingly enough, when the FBI came to the House
[1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:34.000]  They ripped out the hard wire phones
[1:36:34.000 --> 1:36:36.000]  So we no longer have that
[1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:39.000]  And it was only when I was trying to figure out how to reconnect the phones
[1:36:39.000 --> 1:36:43.000]  I realized that there was a DVR drive here that hadn't been taken
[1:36:43.000 --> 1:36:45.000]  That's the only reason we have this
[1:36:45.000 --> 1:36:48.000]  The most chilling thing here is watching the FBI agent
[1:36:48.000 --> 1:36:51.000]  Realize there's a camera and take a piece of tape
[1:36:51.000 --> 1:36:53.000]  And put it over the lens
[1:36:53.000 --> 1:36:56.000]  We're going to go to it, and I don't normally build something up
[1:36:56.000 --> 1:36:58.000]  And I haven't been building it up
[1:36:58.000 --> 1:37:01.000]  It's just so insane, it's so big, it's crazy
[1:37:01.000 --> 1:37:03.000]  So we're going to start rolling
[1:37:03.000 --> 1:37:05.000]  Only TV viewers can see this, radio listeners all scrub
[1:37:05.000 --> 1:37:08.000]  Start rolling the unedited, unblown up, raw footage
[1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:10.000]  And then we speed it up, so this is
[1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:14.000]  The CNN reporter arriving in regular time
[1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:16.000]  And this is unedited, we just speed it up
[1:37:16.000 --> 1:37:18.000]  So we're not sitting here for 30 minutes
[1:37:18.000 --> 1:37:21.000]  And so the CNN reporter stops right in front of your driveway
[1:37:21.000 --> 1:37:25.000]  And you have the subsequent DVRs that this never happened before
[1:37:25.000 --> 1:37:27.000]  This guy's connected to the FBI
[1:37:27.000 --> 1:37:31.000]  He pulls forward, checks the addresses, backs back up
[1:37:33.000 --> 1:37:35.000]  And then we start speeding up the tape
[1:37:35.000 --> 1:37:39.000]  So that we're not sitting here again for 30 minutes waiting
[1:37:39.000 --> 1:37:44.000]  And again, we're here watching this raw footage
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:47.000]  For TV viewers who obviously see it
[1:37:47.000 --> 1:37:50.000]  Now the police start, the federal agents
[1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:54.000]  The henchmen of a Mueller start showing up here
[1:37:54.000 --> 1:37:56.000]  In a few minutes, and they come over
[1:37:56.000 --> 1:37:59.000]  And they talk to the camera person as if they're to know who he is
[1:37:59.000 --> 1:38:01.000]  Obviously if a real raid's about to happen, get out of here
[1:38:01.000 --> 1:38:03.000]  Then he sends up his tripod, more come and talk to him
[1:38:03.000 --> 1:38:05.000]  And then this happens three times
[1:38:05.000 --> 1:38:07.000]  At the end, right before Stone's taken out, they say
[1:38:07.000 --> 1:38:09.000]  Okay, they come over and pat him on the back and they say
[1:38:09.000 --> 1:38:13.000]  You can go, and he then leaves
[1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:20.000]  You see my cat lucky there in front of the car
[1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:26.000]  So that's the raw footage
[1:38:26.000 --> 1:38:29.000]  Now let's go to the blown up footage
[1:38:29.000 --> 1:38:31.000]  We're now going to go to the blown up
[1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:33.000]  And obviously this is this one over like almost an hour
[1:38:33.000 --> 1:38:37.000]  So sped up footage, but we stop and slow down during the parts
[1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:41.000]  So here's blown up footage, the very same footage you just saw
[1:38:41.000 --> 1:38:44.000]  You see this blow it up right there on the software
[1:38:44.000 --> 1:38:49.000]  And then you see the CNN vehicle pull up
[1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:54.000]  That looks like a Ford expedition
[1:38:54.000 --> 1:38:56.000]  And then he backs back up as I said
[1:38:56.000 --> 1:38:59.000]  And then we speed it through the next 45 minutes or so
[1:38:59.000 --> 1:39:03.000]  But this is incredible because right there on the tape
[1:39:03.000 --> 1:39:05.000]  Just keep rolling it in lifetime, guys
[1:39:05.000 --> 1:39:07.000]  Because I spent a lot of time this morning on this
[1:39:07.000 --> 1:39:10.000]  And I know it's on the tape, so let's go back to it
[1:39:10.000 --> 1:39:12.000]  And we've got him sitting right there
[1:39:16.000 --> 1:39:19.000]  And then at a certain point, they show up and all this happens
[1:39:19.000 --> 1:39:23.000]  We'll just keep that rolling while Roger is speaking
[1:39:23.000 --> 1:39:25.000]  So continue, Roger
[1:39:25.000 --> 1:39:30.000]  Well, you see the CNN crew there
[1:39:30.000 --> 1:39:32.000]  Perched in front of my house
[1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:36.000]  The time code is not correct
[1:39:36.000 --> 1:39:40.000]  Because it was set incorrectly by the camera
[1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:44.000]  But since we know the exact time of my arrest was 6 o'clock
[1:39:44.000 --> 1:39:47.000]  You can figure out the real times here
[1:39:47.000 --> 1:39:49.000]  And we made that very clear
[1:39:49.000 --> 1:39:52.000]  Now you see him get out of the car
[1:39:52.000 --> 1:39:57.000]  And you see him, the CNN crew
[1:39:57.000 --> 1:39:59.000]  That's a neighbor there
[1:39:59.000 --> 1:40:03.000]  You see him talk to whoever's in the car
[1:40:03.000 --> 1:40:07.000]  That's most likely one of the FBI officials
[1:40:07.000 --> 1:40:10.000]  When the car pulls away, you will see him
[1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:12.000]  Or the car backs up, pardon me
[1:40:12.000 --> 1:40:15.000]  You'll see him set up his tripod
[1:40:15.000 --> 1:40:20.000]  Now, at this point, my neighbors who are out walking their dogs
[1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:23.000]  Tell me that they were told to go back in their homes and stay there
[1:40:23.000 --> 1:40:26.000]  You see him now go to the rear of the vehicle
[1:40:26.000 --> 1:40:30.000]  And to begin to set up his camera equipment
[1:40:30.000 --> 1:40:32.000]  If I am theoretically dangerous
[1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:37.000]  So dangerous that it takes 29 SWAT team outfitted
[1:40:37.000 --> 1:40:42.000]  Assault weapon, wielding FBI agents to take me
[1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:45.000]  And my 73-year-old wife into custody
[1:40:45.000 --> 1:40:49.000]  Why is this man being permitted to stay 25 feet from my front door?
[1:40:49.000 --> 1:40:51.000]  Why is he allowed to do this?
[1:40:51.000 --> 1:40:55.000]  It's because there's a willful effort to poison the jury pool
[1:40:55.000 --> 1:40:58.000]  And to pick me as a desperado
[1:40:58.000 --> 1:41:02.000]  As the single most dangerous person in America
[1:41:02.000 --> 1:41:04.000]  Public enemy number one
[1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:09.000]  That, despite the fact that I am not accused of any violent crime
[1:41:09.000 --> 1:41:11.000]  And have no previous record
[1:41:11.000 --> 1:41:15.000]  In the front seat, Josh Campbell, the producer for CNN
[1:41:15.000 --> 1:41:19.000]  Former special assistant to FBI director James Comey
[1:41:19.000 --> 1:41:25.000]  A man who did lie to Congress under oath about many things
[1:41:25.000 --> 1:41:29.000]  But has not yet had his home rated by the FBI
[1:41:29.000 --> 1:41:31.000]  On the orders of Robert Mueller
[1:41:31.000 --> 1:41:33.000]  The CNN is very clever
[1:41:33.000 --> 1:41:35.000]  They put another guy out front
[1:41:35.000 --> 1:41:38.000]  Not their FBI connected producer
[1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:40.000]  But they are busted
[1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:43.000]  And everything they have said so far is a lie
[1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:45.000]  They sent my lawyer
[1:41:45.000 --> 1:41:48.000]  Then I see the FBI rolling up as the raid begins
[1:41:48.000 --> 1:41:51.000]  The CNN camera is now running
[1:41:51.000 --> 1:41:52.000]  You see him?
[1:41:52.000 --> 1:41:54.000]  He grabs the camera out of the car
[1:41:54.000 --> 1:41:56.000]  Films the FBI
[1:41:56.000 --> 1:41:58.000]  Why isn't he being told to leave?
[1:41:58.000 --> 1:41:59.000]  I'm dangerous
[1:41:59.000 --> 1:42:03.000]  The armed men now swarming into my front yard
[1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:06.000]  Fanning out to take me into custody
[1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:08.000]  There you see it
[1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:10.000]  God, this turns my stomach
[1:42:10.000 --> 1:42:13.000]  So again, if you're a TV viewer, you can see all this
[1:42:13.000 --> 1:42:15.000]  You're going to see several more times the FBI
[1:42:15.000 --> 1:42:17.000]  Then comes and talks to him, congratulates him
[1:42:17.000 --> 1:42:18.000]  And tells him to leave
[1:42:18.000 --> 1:42:20.000]  The whole thing is completely staged
[1:42:20.000 --> 1:42:22.000]  And this is the America we live in
[1:42:22.000 --> 1:42:23.000]  When we come back
[1:42:23.000 --> 1:42:26.000]  The second and third contact with the FBI by CNN
[1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:28.000]  Standing right there with a walking right passing
[1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:29.000]  Talking to him
[1:42:29.000 --> 1:42:31.000]  And them saying they never saw him, never knew what happened
[1:42:31.000 --> 1:42:32.000]  Never authorized it
[1:42:32.000 --> 1:42:34.000]  And then the exclusive footage
[1:42:34.000 --> 1:42:36.000]  That dramatically is more powerful
[1:42:36.000 --> 1:42:38.000]  Where it shows Roger being let out in handcuffs
[1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:39.000]  And more
[1:42:39.000 --> 1:42:41.000]  He's been uploaded to infowars.com
[1:42:41.000 --> 1:42:43.000]  And newswars.com
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:44.000]  Ladies and gentlemen
[1:42:44.000 --> 1:42:45.000]  We'll be right back
[1:42:45.000 --> 1:42:47.000]  Caught them red-handed
[1:42:47.000 --> 1:42:48.000]  It really gets powerful
[1:42:48.000 --> 1:42:49.000]  On the other side
[1:42:49.000 --> 1:42:50.000]  Stay with us
[1:42:50.000 --> 1:42:53.000]  by helps
[1:43:07.000 --> 1:43:09.000]  by leaps and by bounds
[1:43:09.000 --> 1:43:13.000]  The number one bestselling supplement family in the world
[1:43:13.000 --> 1:43:16.000]  Is energy drinks and energy supplements
[1:43:16.000 --> 1:43:18.000]  But they are riddled with dyes
[1:43:18.000 --> 1:43:22.800]  toxins and synthetic caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn
[1:43:22.800 --> 1:43:25.680]  out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.

[1:43:48.680 --> 1:43:54.280]  time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.

[1:43:57.280 --> 1:44:03.560]  Wars are like 12 round heavyweight boxing championship fights.
[1:44:03.560 --> 1:44:07.960]  It's about who wants it, who's prepared to go the longest and who's ready to do the
[1:44:07.960 --> 1:44:08.960]  damage.
[1:44:08.960 --> 1:44:14.000]  We took on Hillary Clinton, we stopped her, we got a nationalist in.
[1:44:14.000 --> 1:44:15.920]  Most are getting elected all over the world right now.
[1:44:15.920 --> 1:44:21.360]  We are winning, but those of us who are at the very front line at the tip of the spear
[1:44:21.360 --> 1:44:23.200]  are under unprecedented attack.

[1:47:29.640 --> 1:47:38.640]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[1:47:38.640 --> 1:47:54.760]  So, Roger Stones, our exclusive guest, we just showed, if you are watching on television,
[1:47:54.760 --> 1:48:01.640]  the first time that the FBI comes up to the CNN that's been there for 30 minutes, blocks
[1:48:01.640 --> 1:48:05.720]  the road, lets them stay there, wanders fast until the raid begins, and we're going to
[1:48:05.720 --> 1:48:10.200]  show you two more times on the footage where they talked to the reporter, they said they
[1:48:10.200 --> 1:48:12.600]  never saw, never knew, never directed.
[1:48:12.600 --> 1:48:17.720]  And then they tried to abscond with the evidence, they tried to obstruct justice of the crime
[1:48:17.720 --> 1:48:23.320]  they committed, leaking the felony warrant, all the rest of it, and this is all criminal,
[1:48:23.320 --> 1:48:24.520]  very criminal.
[1:48:24.520 --> 1:48:29.080]  They then tried to cover up the cameras with tape, we have that footage coming up.
[1:48:29.080 --> 1:48:34.800]  They then tried to take the other DVR, they were unsuccessful doing that, so we have all
[1:48:34.800 --> 1:48:40.560]  that footage coming up for you in just a few minutes, but Roger, narrate this for us now
[1:48:40.560 --> 1:48:44.000]  as you watch from your home where this happened in Florida a few weeks ago with this global
[1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:49.000]  exclusive that just shows the lie of Mueller, the fraud, the media, CNN lying, it's so huge,
[1:48:49.000 --> 1:48:53.880]  I just can't describe it, the next two times that the FBI talks to them, and the third
[1:48:53.880 --> 1:48:59.800]  time right before you're let out, a group gets around the CNN reporters and tells them,
[1:48:59.800 --> 1:49:03.480]  get out of here, so let's roll that.
[1:49:03.480 --> 1:49:12.760]  So now you see the first of 17 FBI vehicles that arrived, you see the armed agents getting
[1:49:12.760 --> 1:49:22.000]  out of their trucks, two of the vehicles were armored vehicles, you see the CNN camera running,
[1:49:22.000 --> 1:49:28.240]  the FBI agent walks right by the camera, doesn't tell him to leave, yet the street has been
[1:49:28.240 --> 1:49:32.560]  sealed at the end of the street, it's a dead end street, and my neighbors have been told
[1:49:32.560 --> 1:49:37.960]  to stay inside their houses, you see the cameraman taking pictures of the additional
[1:49:37.960 --> 1:49:44.040]  agents, you now see the agents swarming my home, what you can't see here is two boats
[1:49:44.040 --> 1:49:51.240]  have pulled up to the back, there you see the, you can see an FBI official speaking
[1:49:51.240 --> 1:49:57.440]  to the cameraman to the left of the picture, and in the back of the house at this exact
[1:49:57.440 --> 1:50:05.960]  time, agents are swarming, there you see again, you see the producer, Josh Campbell, former
[1:50:05.960 --> 1:50:15.840]  special assistant to James Comey, and he is directing the action, you see the FBI agent,
[1:50:15.840 --> 1:50:23.600]  you see the two CNN officials there, now you see them picking up, there you see he goes
[1:50:23.600 --> 1:50:30.560]  for his cell phone, very clearly tipped off in advance of the raid, now they're waiting
[1:50:30.560 --> 1:50:39.720]  for the next piece of action, you see an additional agent, now you see the FBI talking actively
[1:50:39.720 --> 1:50:45.320]  and telling them, okay, you guys got what you needed, and they're finally being told
[1:50:45.320 --> 1:50:50.600]  to leave, so again, the FBI is well aware that CNN is there, well aware that they're
[1:50:50.600 --> 1:50:57.680]  filming, they walk right by them, they allow them to film the swarming of my home, now
[1:50:57.680 --> 1:51:04.320]  they only tell them to leave when I'm about to be dramatically brought out in cuffs, I
[1:51:04.320 --> 1:51:10.160]  was, you know, obviously, I'm just seeing this footage close up for the first time,
[1:51:10.160 --> 1:51:16.440]  I've seen it from far away, and it still turned my stomach, now you see the FBI directing
[1:51:16.440 --> 1:51:24.680]  their cohorts, their partners in crime at CNN, you can go to Stone Cold Truth right now,
[1:51:24.680 --> 1:51:30.880]  if you want to learn more about my situation, or if you want to contribute to Stone Defense
[1:51:30.880 --> 1:51:36.200]  Fund, there's a link right there at the Stone Cold Truth, there's a chilling example here,
[1:51:36.200 --> 1:51:41.480]  I am, you can see I have been handcuffed, again, we have the infrared cameras, which
[1:51:41.480 --> 1:51:47.480]  is why I'm wearing a black shirt actually, but until the sun comes up, when you'll see
[1:51:47.480 --> 1:51:52.520]  the color of all the pictures dramatically shift to color, notice on the right, there's
[1:51:52.520 --> 1:51:58.640]  a man holding a rifle, still pointed at the picture window of my home, the FBI agent who
[1:51:58.640 --> 1:52:03.920]  was walking me out was very courteous and very polite, very professional, treated me
[1:52:03.920 --> 1:52:09.200]  well, gave me some water, later on he gave me a protein bar, because I was getting hungry,
[1:52:09.200 --> 1:52:14.000]  but you see I have been walked out to the street, and I've asked now for, to see my
[1:52:14.000 --> 1:52:18.160]  lawyer three times, and I was told I could see my lawyer later.
[1:52:18.160 --> 1:52:22.160]  And again, Roger, the huge issue here is, and we're going to have the rest of the footage
[1:52:22.160 --> 1:52:26.040]  next hour, because the issue of blurring the FBI agent's faces out, became a big fiasco
[1:52:26.040 --> 1:52:31.000]  here, and that's why this is all behind, and hell, we may even have it today at this rate,
[1:52:31.000 --> 1:52:34.680]  but it's your wife being marched out as well, it's them running around putting tape over
[1:52:34.680 --> 1:52:39.680]  all the cameras, that is all, that is all coming up next hour, and I need you to stay
[1:52:39.680 --> 1:52:43.560]  with us, but I know you've got reporters right now, I can see you putting cameras through
[1:52:43.560 --> 1:52:48.440]  your window, you were just doing the Nixon salute, I mean this is just a crazy time to
[1:52:48.440 --> 1:52:52.120]  be alive, but I want to get the listeners ratcheted back into this, we're posting videos
[1:52:52.120 --> 1:52:59.120]  in FullWars.com and NewsWars.com that are boil downs of the three times the FBI directed
[1:52:59.120 --> 1:53:07.040]  the CNN crew, one of which has worked for Comey, they've been caught lying to the President,
[1:53:07.040 --> 1:53:12.640]  to the media, to Congress, releasing felony warrant information to CNN, CNN screwed up
[1:53:12.640 --> 1:53:17.000]  and sent that to you, I mean this is going to be very powerful info for any congressional
[1:53:17.000 --> 1:53:18.400]  hearing, isn't it, Roger?
[1:53:18.400 --> 1:53:23.480]  No, it really is, and I'm very grateful that Senator Lindsey Graham is willing to get to
[1:53:23.480 --> 1:53:27.880]  the bottom of this, that he showed some leadership last week and wanted to know why this kind
[1:53:27.880 --> 1:53:32.920]  of excessive force was being used, Alex, you could expect this in Nazi Germany, you would
[1:53:32.920 --> 1:53:39.160]  expect this in Soviet Russia, Stalin would approve of Mr. Mueller's conduct here, I could
[1:53:39.160 --> 1:53:44.320]  have saved the taxpayers a half million dollars, they knew I was represented by competent counsel,
[1:53:44.320 --> 1:53:48.720]  had they contacted them, I would have turned myself in voluntarily, and I still would
[1:53:48.720 --> 1:53:52.880]  have pled not guilty, and I would have looked the hell of a lot better in my mug shot than
[1:53:52.880 --> 1:53:59.080]  the one they ultimately took, but instead they had to rouse me, terrorize my wife, who's
[1:53:59.080 --> 1:54:04.840]  73 years old and hearing impaired, terrorize my dogs, who for two days wouldn't come out
[1:54:04.840 --> 1:54:09.600]  from under the bed and couldn't stop shaking, the cats seem to have taken it pretty well,
[1:54:09.600 --> 1:54:15.200]  there you see it again, one more time, the FBI directs the CNN camera operator the second
[1:54:15.200 --> 1:54:20.200]  time, telling him where to move his camera, so make sure they get plenty of footage of
[1:54:20.200 --> 1:54:27.000]  the FBI agents swarming my home, they are wearing night goggles at this point because
[1:54:27.000 --> 1:54:34.520]  it is dark and the sun has not yet come up, now finally, only after they're about to
[1:54:34.520 --> 1:54:41.160]  perp walk me out into the street to the humiliation of all my neighbors, I might add, do they
[1:54:41.160 --> 1:54:48.920]  finally tell CNN to leave, they knew CNN was there, Sarah Murray of CNN coordinated this,
[1:54:48.920 --> 1:54:54.600]  this is why she called me the day before wanting my home address, well wait a minute, CNN says
[1:54:54.600 --> 1:54:59.640]  that they've been surveilling my home every Friday for months, that's a lie, I have the
[1:54:59.640 --> 1:55:05.400]  security camera footage that proves it was a lie, there you have it, 15 minutes before
[1:55:05.400 --> 1:55:12.200]  my arrest, who pulls up, but the CNN camera crew, CNN is busted, they will hide behind
[1:55:12.200 --> 1:55:16.920]  their journalistic privilege to avoid answering questions, but Mr. Muller must be asked under
[1:55:16.920 --> 1:55:23.240]  oath, Mr. Weissman must be asked under oath, Mr. Pirro, the head of the FBI in Miami must
[1:55:23.240 --> 1:55:29.960]  be asked under oath, Mr. Whitaker needs to be asked what he knew about this, I think
[1:55:29.960 --> 1:55:35.960]  the answer is nothing, and Christopher Wray, the most epically corrupt FBI director since
[1:55:35.960 --> 1:55:42.280]  J. Edgar Hoover needs to be asked, what did he know about this and when did he know it,
[1:55:42.280 --> 1:55:47.440]  this is a man who lied to President Trump's face about whether the president was under
[1:55:47.440 --> 1:55:51.800]  investigation, lied to the Congress about it, yet there is no raid on his home, he's
[1:55:51.800 --> 1:55:57.280]  doing the raiding in this case, it's very hard to believe Alex that this could actually
[1:55:57.280 --> 1:55:59.960]  happen in America, this is the kind of-
[1:55:59.960 --> 1:56:05.320]  I agree, but what about the biblical providence that they didn't get the right DVR and we
[1:56:05.320 --> 1:56:10.120]  have the footage, I mean, we have them now directing CNN saying they even know CNN was
[1:56:10.120 --> 1:56:14.360]  there, they had nothing to do with them, I mean, we have them, they're absolutely been
[1:56:14.360 --> 1:56:20.440]  caught red-handed, ladies and gentlemen, this is just incredible, it's all on tape, it's
[1:56:20.440 --> 1:56:25.640]  all coming up next hour, we just had to blur their faces out so that took a while, and
[1:56:25.640 --> 1:56:31.080]  it's just incredible, Roger, I want to just say this very quickly, please remember that

[2:00:08.160 --> 2:00:38.000]  So, we've spent a large part of the
[2:00:38.000 --> 2:00:50.320]  broadcast here, talking about Roger Stone and all the things that are going on here.
[2:00:50.320 --> 2:00:53.720]  But again, this is them caught red-handed lying to the public, saying they didn't stage
[2:00:53.720 --> 2:00:57.520]  the raid, saying they didn't involve CNN, and it's all right there, Roger.
[2:00:57.520 --> 2:01:02.160]  We've got some of the final clips coming up next segment, but it's just mind-boggling
[2:01:02.160 --> 2:01:08.160]  that this goes on and all the lying by this embedded group of criminals that the Clintons
[2:01:08.160 --> 2:01:10.160]  and others put in at the FBI.
[2:01:10.160 --> 2:01:14.680]  What a scourge of snot-nosed rats, and why is everyone so scared of them?
[2:01:14.680 --> 2:01:20.760]  Well, in fact, the President just appointed a new number two at the FBI as the Anti-Terrorism
[2:01:20.760 --> 2:01:24.120]  Chief, who is a deep-state colleague of Robert Mueller.
[2:01:24.120 --> 2:01:29.880]  Mr. President, please wake up, appoint somebody you actually know, somebody who is loyal to
[2:01:29.880 --> 2:01:36.120]  the goals of your administration, stop appointing Clintonite, Bushite criminals to these positions.
[2:01:36.120 --> 2:01:38.160]  It is really extraordinary.
[2:01:38.160 --> 2:01:43.760]  So look, Alex, as you know, they're trying to lock me away for 45 years, which is what
[2:01:43.760 --> 2:01:48.720]  I would get if I am found guilty, potentially, of the things that I am not guilty of, that
[2:01:48.720 --> 2:01:51.160]  I have pled innocent to.
[2:01:51.160 --> 2:01:52.600]  This is a witch hunt.
[2:01:52.600 --> 2:01:55.640]  I am being targeted because I appear on InfoWars.
[2:01:55.640 --> 2:01:58.720]  I'm being targeted because I work with Alex Jones.
[2:01:58.720 --> 2:02:02.400]  I'm being targeted because I supported Donald Trump for President.
[2:02:02.400 --> 2:02:07.800]  I'm being targeted because I helped defeat the evil queen, Hillary Clinton, and because
[2:02:07.800 --> 2:02:12.120]  I wrote the Clinton's War on Women, which you can buy right now at the InfoWars.com
[2:02:12.120 --> 2:02:18.600]  store, the definitive oppo breakdown on Bill and Hillary Clinton, available at the InfoWars.com
[2:02:18.600 --> 2:02:20.440]  store at a great price.
[2:02:20.440 --> 2:02:27.360]  This chilling video shows red-handed that CNN is busted, that Sarah Murray is a liar,
[2:02:27.360 --> 2:02:31.720]  that Wolf Blitzer, who has the worst breath of anybody on television, by the way, is a
[2:02:31.720 --> 2:02:37.240]  liar, not a journalist, a con man, not a journalist, a hupster, not a journalist, a liar.
[2:02:37.240 --> 2:02:39.280]  These people are beyond the pale.
[2:02:39.280 --> 2:02:45.320]  CNN is not a news organization, and they have worked hand in glove with the deep state to
[2:02:45.320 --> 2:02:49.800]  attempt to paint a picture of me as public enemy number one.
[2:02:49.800 --> 2:02:51.680]  This is a crime.
[2:02:51.680 --> 2:02:57.840]  The leak of an arrest, the leak of a warrant, the leak of an indictment is a crime.
[2:02:57.840 --> 2:03:00.560]  Sarah Murray is guilty of a crime.
[2:03:00.560 --> 2:03:03.200]  CNN is guilty of a crime.
[2:03:03.200 --> 2:03:07.440]  There are members of the Mother Task Force who have committed a crime.
[2:03:07.440 --> 2:03:10.320]  Mr. Whitaker, do you believe in the rule of law?
[2:03:10.320 --> 2:03:12.480]  Are you afraid of these people?
[2:03:12.480 --> 2:03:14.320]  When will the president take action?
[2:03:14.320 --> 2:03:19.640]  We need a new special counsel who needs to target these globalist criminals.
[2:03:19.640 --> 2:03:21.800]  They're the ones who were in bed with Russia.
[2:03:21.800 --> 2:03:26.080]  They're the ones who took $145 million from the Russian energy company.
[2:03:26.080 --> 2:03:31.720]  They're the ones who slept the uranium samples to Stockholm for the Russians to inspect before
[2:03:31.720 --> 2:03:33.240]  they closed the deal.
[2:03:33.240 --> 2:03:34.600]  That's treason.
[2:03:34.600 --> 2:03:36.800]  The penalty for treason is execution.
[2:03:36.800 --> 2:03:38.200]  It's capital punishment.
[2:03:38.200 --> 2:03:40.640]  Hillary, my friends, is eligible.
[2:03:40.640 --> 2:03:44.600]  That is the largest treasonous crime in American history.
[2:03:44.600 --> 2:03:47.880]  Now you see the agents swarming my front door.
[2:03:47.880 --> 2:03:54.840]  You see two agents holding assault weapons, aiming through the window.
[2:03:54.840 --> 2:03:55.840]  This is chilling.
[2:03:55.840 --> 2:03:57.440]  There's a side window there.
[2:03:57.440 --> 2:03:59.080]  You see he's looking in the window.
[2:03:59.080 --> 2:04:01.520]  I did not come down the stairs.
[2:04:01.520 --> 2:04:02.640]  He's listening.
[2:04:02.640 --> 2:04:05.520]  Now he pounds on the door, but he doesn't say anything.
[2:04:05.520 --> 2:04:07.280]  All I hear is a pounding.
[2:04:07.280 --> 2:04:14.280]  Now he pounds on the door again and yells, FBI, I'm coming down the staircase.
[2:04:14.280 --> 2:04:19.240]  I open the door looking down the barrel of two assault weapons.
[2:04:19.240 --> 2:04:22.200]  You can see me putting my hands in the air because I don't want to be shot.
[2:04:22.200 --> 2:04:28.200]  Maybe it's a good thing CNN is there because I might have been shot and you see them handcuff
[2:04:28.200 --> 2:04:29.200]  me.
[2:04:29.200 --> 2:04:34.840]  Yeah, because Mueller got put in by Bush and the Clintons and he's the president.
[2:04:34.840 --> 2:04:35.840]  They rule America.
[2:04:35.840 --> 2:04:37.560]  They're going to open the borders up.
[2:04:37.560 --> 2:04:40.880]  They're going to kill babies after they're born and they're just going to wander around
[2:04:40.880 --> 2:04:44.400]  on their white shoe boy suits and do it all.
[2:04:44.400 --> 2:04:46.360]  And I guess we could never get to blur in the faces.
[2:04:46.360 --> 2:04:47.760]  We're just going to air it all coming up good.
[2:04:47.760 --> 2:04:48.760]  I don't give a damn anyway.
[2:04:48.760 --> 2:04:49.760]  A bunch of crap.
[2:04:49.760 --> 2:04:50.760]  A bunch of idiots.
[2:04:50.760 --> 2:04:53.760]  But in all honesty, these people, some of them have to be prosecuted.
[2:04:53.760 --> 2:05:05.560]  Yeah, they need to be prosecuted to stay with us.
[2:05:05.560 --> 2:05:07.880]  My leaps and my bounds.
[2:05:07.880 --> 2:05:14.680]  The number one best selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[2:05:14.680 --> 2:05:19.880]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeine and other chemicals
[2:05:19.880 --> 2:05:24.120]  that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side
[2:05:24.120 --> 2:05:25.120]  effects.
[2:05:25.120 --> 2:05:31.280]  We have developed hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout
[2:05:31.280 --> 2:05:34.120]  and beyond system in the world.
[2:05:34.120 --> 2:05:35.640]  There's nothing else like it.
[2:05:35.640 --> 2:05:41.120]  It is a total game changer and it comes in easy to use, packaged, mixed in with fruit
[2:05:41.120 --> 2:05:43.560]  juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[2:05:43.560 --> 2:05:45.080]  Warning though, it's very, very strong.
[2:05:45.080 --> 2:05:46.580]  It lasts 10 hours.
[2:05:46.580 --> 2:05:50.680]  So take a half pack at the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce
[2:05:50.680 --> 2:05:53.200]  because it will take you into overdrive.
[2:05:53.200 --> 2:06:08.520]  TurboForce and enforcelive.com.
[2:06:08.520 --> 2:06:38.480]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[2:06:38.480 --> 2:06:49.480]  Roger Stone exclusively joins us and we're going to go through all this footage and be
[2:06:49.480 --> 2:06:57.640]  posting it to infowars.com and newswars.com and prisonplanner.com as we go through it.
[2:06:57.640 --> 2:07:00.200]  But we'll show his wife being marched out in a moment.
[2:07:00.200 --> 2:07:07.840]  But I think overshadowing all of this, Roger, is that this is a political witch hunt.
[2:07:07.840 --> 2:07:13.520]  You weren't indicted for any Russian collusion and they've been caught lying to the press
[2:07:13.520 --> 2:07:14.520]  again.
[2:07:14.520 --> 2:07:15.520]  They've been caught lying to Congress.
[2:07:15.520 --> 2:07:18.320]  They've been caught lying to everybody about what they did.
[2:07:18.320 --> 2:07:24.560]  And I think this raid has really blown up in their face, but you can't overstate how
[2:07:24.560 --> 2:07:29.240]  big it is to have CNN on tape being directed by the FBI.
[2:07:29.240 --> 2:07:33.600]  With the FBI and other saying, they didn't even know CNN was there when obviously they
[2:07:33.600 --> 2:07:34.600]  did.
[2:07:34.600 --> 2:07:38.520]  And the cameras right there with the men all walking around it and talking to the reporter,
[2:07:38.520 --> 2:07:39.680]  they just blocked off the streets.
[2:07:39.680 --> 2:07:40.760]  Yes, they staged this.
[2:07:40.760 --> 2:07:48.240]  So the arrogance to lie to the people, it just shows terminal level hubris or hoodspot.
[2:07:48.240 --> 2:07:54.080]  Well, Alex, this, the footage we just showed of my poor wife being perp walked out in the
[2:07:54.080 --> 2:07:55.080]  street.
[2:07:55.080 --> 2:07:57.960]  Hashtag, neediestone did nothing wrong.
[2:07:57.960 --> 2:07:59.440]  She's not accused of any crime.
[2:07:59.440 --> 2:08:01.680]  Why is she being abused like this?
[2:08:01.680 --> 2:08:02.960]  Sprinks my heart.
[2:08:02.960 --> 2:08:06.080]  This is outrageous that this can happen in America.
[2:08:06.080 --> 2:08:08.720]  She and her family fled Fidel Castro's Gulag.
[2:08:08.720 --> 2:08:10.840]  There she is.
[2:08:10.840 --> 2:08:13.160]  Why is she being manhandled?
[2:08:13.160 --> 2:08:15.520]  This makes no sense to me.
[2:08:15.520 --> 2:08:19.560]  It's hard for me to believe that this can actually happen in America.
[2:08:19.560 --> 2:08:21.600]  Mr. President, I hope you see this.
[2:08:21.600 --> 2:08:26.120]  There you see those courageous FBI agents putting tape over the cameras.
[2:08:26.120 --> 2:08:28.160]  Now the sun has come up.
[2:08:28.160 --> 2:08:31.520]  That's why we've switched to color.
[2:08:31.520 --> 2:08:35.200]  Senator Graham, please question that man with the beard.
[2:08:35.200 --> 2:08:38.480]  Find him and question him in front of your committee.
[2:08:38.480 --> 2:08:40.520]  Ask him who gave the orders for this.
[2:08:40.520 --> 2:08:41.520]  That's a cover-up.
[2:08:41.520 --> 2:08:44.200]  You see, they want to cover up their criminality.
[2:08:44.200 --> 2:08:46.080]  And they thought they took this tape.
[2:08:46.080 --> 2:08:48.440]  They didn't realize they left this tape behind.
[2:08:48.440 --> 2:08:51.760]  I turned this tape over to the House and Senate investigators.
[2:08:51.760 --> 2:08:56.400]  I did not leak it to Sinclair, but now that it's out there in a truncated version, Alex,
[2:08:56.400 --> 2:09:00.640]  I want to thank you for having the courage to show all of it, for having the courage
[2:09:00.640 --> 2:09:05.960]  to show CNN colluding with the FBI in violation of the law.
[2:09:05.960 --> 2:09:07.960]  Somebody has to be prosecuted.
[2:09:07.960 --> 2:09:11.960]  Sarah Murray, S-A-R-A, Sarah Murray, you can find her on Instagram.
[2:09:11.960 --> 2:09:14.920]  You can find her on Facebook.
[2:09:14.920 --> 2:09:16.920]  She has not told the truth about this.
[2:09:16.920 --> 2:09:22.080]  Why was she calling me to ask me my home address the day before the raid if CNN now says that
[2:09:22.080 --> 2:09:25.360]  they've been staking out my house every Friday for months?
[2:09:25.360 --> 2:09:27.760]  But the security video shows that that's a lie.
[2:09:27.760 --> 2:09:34.480]  Josh Campbell, former, now at CNN, former special assistant to FBI director James Comey.
[2:09:34.480 --> 2:09:36.840]  What did he know and when did he know it?
[2:09:36.840 --> 2:09:39.760]  This is the most obvious setup I've ever seen.
[2:09:39.760 --> 2:09:46.800]  And right now, while we're showing this to you, ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, begging for copies
[2:09:46.800 --> 2:09:52.800]  of this footage so they can edit it, so they can cut CNN's cameraman out of the picture,
[2:09:52.800 --> 2:09:56.960]  so they can give you a false impression, oh, look at them take down the criminal Roger
[2:09:56.960 --> 2:09:57.960]  Stone.
[2:09:57.960 --> 2:10:03.160]  No, only here at InfoWars will you see the unedited, untouched-up version.
[2:10:03.160 --> 2:10:07.720]  Alex, I want to thank you again for having the courage to show this because there aren't
[2:10:07.720 --> 2:10:10.960]  many journalistic outlets that would have this courage.
[2:10:10.960 --> 2:10:15.280]  You've had the Cajones to take on the globalists for 25 years.
[2:10:15.280 --> 2:10:18.080]  Maybe this is why we are kindred spirits.
[2:10:18.080 --> 2:10:19.800]  Like you, I will never quit.
[2:10:19.800 --> 2:10:21.040]  I will never give up.
[2:10:21.040 --> 2:10:27.680]  But as I said earlier in the show, the survival of InfoWars as a viable media platform is
[2:10:27.680 --> 2:10:31.840]  essential to my survival and to my ultimate vindication.
[2:10:31.840 --> 2:10:38.320]  If I cannot come here on InfoWars and tell people the truth, then there is zero chance
[2:10:38.320 --> 2:10:39.320]  that I can survive.
[2:10:39.320 --> 2:10:44.760]  And let me assure you, if the judge survives, decides to gag me, I will have no choice but
[2:10:44.760 --> 2:10:46.680]  to adhere to the court's order.
[2:10:46.680 --> 2:10:48.280]  My daughter will speak out.
[2:10:48.280 --> 2:10:50.040]  My son will speak out.
[2:10:50.040 --> 2:10:52.400]  My wife will speak out.
[2:10:52.400 --> 2:10:56.480]  We will not have our First Amendments as a family abridged.
[2:10:56.480 --> 2:10:59.120]  They may try to abridge my First Amendment rights.
[2:10:59.120 --> 2:11:00.960]  The courts will address that.
[2:11:00.960 --> 2:11:07.240]  I obviously, because of judge shopping by the Mueller investigation, I'm in front of
[2:11:07.240 --> 2:11:14.040]  the same activist liberal judge who gagged Paul Manafort in violation of his First Amendment
[2:11:14.040 --> 2:11:15.040]  rights.
[2:11:15.040 --> 2:11:16.040]  I'm not going to talk about the case.
[2:11:16.040 --> 2:11:18.080]  I'm going to do that talking in court.
[2:11:18.080 --> 2:11:21.840]  But people need to understand this is a fixed deal.
[2:11:21.840 --> 2:11:26.520]  And the fact that I would go to trial in the District of Columbia, there you see it.
[2:11:26.520 --> 2:11:28.000]  Can this really happen in America?
[2:11:28.000 --> 2:11:29.560]  I'm 66 years old.
[2:11:29.560 --> 2:11:30.840]  I don't own a gun.
[2:11:30.840 --> 2:11:32.840]  I don't have a valid passport.
[2:11:32.840 --> 2:11:34.600]  I've destroyed no evidence.
[2:11:34.600 --> 2:11:40.720]  And I'm accused of a series of nonviolent process crimes, yet there are your tax dollars
[2:11:40.720 --> 2:11:44.960]  at work, opening the door, staring down the barrel of a gun.
[2:11:44.960 --> 2:11:48.040]  Yes, Senator Graham, the man with the beard.
[2:11:48.040 --> 2:11:49.040]  Question him.
[2:11:49.040 --> 2:11:50.400]  Who ordered him to do this?
[2:11:50.400 --> 2:11:51.720]  Let's find out.
[2:11:51.720 --> 2:11:53.560]  Roger, God bless you.
[2:11:53.560 --> 2:11:54.560]  We'll talk to you soon.
[2:11:54.560 --> 2:11:55.960]  I guess that hearing is coming up tomorrow.
[2:11:55.960 --> 2:11:56.960]  We'll know more.
[2:11:56.960 --> 2:12:01.240]  I guess you'll be in the war room coming up today and we'll have these clips more organized.
[2:12:01.240 --> 2:12:05.040]  Maybe, maybe by then, because I had all of the clips we haven't even seen.
[2:12:05.040 --> 2:12:06.040]  We didn't play him.
[2:12:06.040 --> 2:12:07.040]  I'm not bitching.
[2:12:07.040 --> 2:12:11.400]  You just get all this footage and we're trying to figure out what to do with it.
[2:12:11.400 --> 2:12:15.800]  So we're going to have things more in an orderly format today, obviously, on the war
[2:12:15.800 --> 2:12:20.120]  room three to six PM so we can go over all of this and just have it all condensed down
[2:12:20.120 --> 2:12:25.720]  like here is the first time the CNN talks to the FBI, second time, third time.
[2:12:25.720 --> 2:12:30.320]  And then here's the raid and you know, here's the wife coming out and then, you know, here's
[2:12:30.320 --> 2:12:35.760]  Attorney General Whitaker saying he's investigating and because this is a really big deal.
[2:12:35.760 --> 2:12:37.840]  This is a big deal.
[2:12:37.840 --> 2:12:41.040]  They've said that they didn't give the warrant to CNN, even though they were dumb enough
[2:12:41.040 --> 2:12:42.800]  to send it to you and show they did.
[2:12:42.800 --> 2:12:48.200]  That's a felony and they're just committing so many damn crimes.
[2:12:48.200 --> 2:12:53.920]  It just shows us what a horrible group of criminals that we've got inside our government
[2:12:53.920 --> 2:12:56.440]  and then a bunch of yes, man, that just do whatever they're told.
[2:12:56.440 --> 2:12:57.440]  So God bless you.
[2:12:57.440 --> 2:12:58.440]  StoneDefenseFund.com.
[2:12:58.440 --> 2:13:00.040]  We'll talk to you very soon, Roger.
[2:13:00.040 --> 2:13:05.360]  Well, Alex, I think we may want to think about doing a special emergency broadcast this weekend.
[2:13:05.360 --> 2:13:09.400]  If I'm not gagged, I would be happy to join you because you have the courage to lay it
[2:13:09.400 --> 2:13:11.080]  out for the American people.
[2:13:11.080 --> 2:13:13.640]  You don't pull any punches and you tell the truth.
[2:13:13.640 --> 2:13:15.360]  That's why they're so desperate to gag you.
[2:13:15.360 --> 2:13:20.360]  Yes, folks, go to StoneDefenseFund.com and help me in this epic struggle.
[2:13:20.360 --> 2:13:23.240]  I'm looking at to raise $2 million to defend myself.
[2:13:23.240 --> 2:13:27.080]  And when you're finished there, go to the Infowars.com store.
[2:13:27.080 --> 2:13:33.560]  By the way, Alex, I got to tell you this, stacking Brain Force Plus and Turbo Force
[2:13:33.560 --> 2:13:37.480]  is the most incredible, energizing combination I've found.
[2:13:37.480 --> 2:13:39.160]  I'm working long days.
[2:13:39.160 --> 2:13:44.360]  I'm doing as much media as I can to tell people the truth and try to raise this money.
[2:13:44.360 --> 2:13:50.040]  And my energy has had such an incredible lift by that combination of Turbo Force, which
[2:13:50.040 --> 2:13:54.360]  for my money is the very best product you and the scientists you work with have come
[2:13:54.360 --> 2:13:55.360]  up with.
[2:13:55.360 --> 2:13:59.520]  But when you combine it with Brain Force Plus, which I've sworn by since I first came to
[2:13:59.520 --> 2:14:02.520]  work for you, this is an incredible combination.
[2:14:02.520 --> 2:14:08.920]  And it doesn't leave you feeling wired or nervous or jumping the way the ephedra laced
[2:14:08.920 --> 2:14:11.080]  energy drinks do, like Red Bull.
[2:14:11.080 --> 2:14:14.920]  This gives you a subtle but deep, energized feeling.
[2:14:14.920 --> 2:14:17.400]  It gives you real mental and physical focus.
[2:14:17.400 --> 2:14:20.640]  So I want to congratulate you for this incredible product.
[2:14:20.640 --> 2:14:25.480]  And I recommend taking it with Brain Force Plus, both of them available right now at
[2:14:25.480 --> 2:14:27.680]  the Infowars.com store.
[2:14:27.680 --> 2:14:30.080]  This is what's getting me through my days.
[2:14:30.080 --> 2:14:31.080]  This is what you do.
[2:14:31.080 --> 2:14:32.560]  Well, you do have more energy than usual.
[2:14:32.560 --> 2:14:33.560]  You have a lot of energy.
[2:14:33.560 --> 2:14:38.760]  Look, I know we go out and we say, what is the best selling formula out there for Neutropic?
[2:14:38.760 --> 2:14:42.680]  With similar Brain Force, we just make it better and lower cost.
[2:14:42.680 --> 2:14:43.680]  What's the hottest market?
[2:14:43.680 --> 2:14:47.560]  Well, pre-workout or long-term energy stuff that doesn't give you a crash.
[2:14:47.560 --> 2:14:51.560]  Well, let's just take whatever the best formulas are and make it even better, lower the price.
[2:14:51.560 --> 2:14:52.560]  That's what we do.
[2:14:52.560 --> 2:14:56.080]  And again, the Brain Synergy Combo only has two reviews.
[2:14:56.080 --> 2:14:57.080]  That just went up.
[2:14:57.080 --> 2:15:00.040]  The bad guys always hit the reviews when they first go up and give fake reviews.
[2:15:00.040 --> 2:15:01.720]  But once there's time, they always do it.
[2:15:01.720 --> 2:15:05.120]  So let's show the review for Turbo Force by itself.
[2:15:05.120 --> 2:15:06.120]  Go there.
[2:15:06.120 --> 2:15:08.120]  You'll see the massive positive reviews.
[2:15:08.120 --> 2:15:11.480]  It's on the front page of infowarsstore.com.
[2:15:11.480 --> 2:15:12.480]  That's where you go.
[2:15:12.480 --> 2:15:16.520]  And you can just click on, scroll down a little bit there for TV viewers.
[2:15:16.520 --> 2:15:17.920]  Just scroll down a little bit.
[2:15:17.920 --> 2:15:19.680]  I speak from experience, Alex.
[2:15:19.680 --> 2:15:22.280]  This combination works better than anything I have tried.
[2:15:22.280 --> 2:15:24.760]  So there's a testimonial that's not rigged.
[2:15:24.760 --> 2:15:25.920]  That's not phony.
[2:15:25.920 --> 2:15:27.400]  Try this combination, folks.
[2:15:27.400 --> 2:15:31.720]  Turbo Force and Brain Force Plus, it is keeping me fighting 24 hours.
[2:15:31.720 --> 2:15:32.920]  You know, thank you, Roger.
[2:15:32.920 --> 2:15:36.800]  But what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to infowarscore.com.
[2:15:36.800 --> 2:15:38.760]  I'm going to print reviews for Turbo Force.
[2:15:38.760 --> 2:15:43.760]  I'm going to read some of those when we come back from Turbo Force by itself that's been
[2:15:43.760 --> 2:15:44.760]  getting reviewed a few weeks.
[2:15:44.760 --> 2:15:45.760]  92% right there.
[2:15:45.760 --> 2:15:47.640]  A whole bunch of five stars.
[2:15:47.640 --> 2:15:48.640]  It's amazing.
[2:15:48.640 --> 2:15:52.400]  And it really pisses the left off that we have reviews at the third party size that
[2:15:52.400 --> 2:15:53.400]  can't stand it.
[2:15:53.400 --> 2:15:55.520]  Thank you, Roger.
[2:15:55.520 --> 2:15:59.240]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[2:15:59.240 --> 2:16:04.040]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally

[2:16:26.400 --> 2:16:30.320]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[2:16:30.320 --> 2:16:31.840]  I sued the IRS and won.
[2:16:31.840 --> 2:16:34.840]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.

[2:22:34.620 --> 2:22:39.300]  on the border, we must end the border. When these are smugglers, who knows, just showing
[2:22:39.300 --> 2:22:43.740]  up with kids and they admit that, this is the assault on the very nature and the existence
[2:22:43.740 --> 2:22:48.100]  of our country. I appreciate Trent's forecaster, good friend of mine, Gerald Salente joining
[2:22:48.100 --> 2:22:53.340]  us to talk about all of this and he's got a raft of big issues he's going to get into,
[2:22:53.340 --> 2:23:00.780]  but first off, I don't normally hype, hype, hype, but I know it's something so big that
[2:23:00.780 --> 2:23:04.980]  it's not going to get attention, I'm going to try to fight it getting attention.
[2:23:04.980 --> 2:23:12.180]  And that was three different clips of the CNN reporters showing up with the FBI being directed
[2:23:12.180 --> 2:23:19.860]  by the FBI. When the FBI denied all of this and when they've been caught lying, GeraldTrentsResearch.com,
[2:23:19.860 --> 2:23:25.300]  for me, this is just a huge issue because Sinclair got a little clip of this, Roger
[2:23:25.300 --> 2:23:31.260]  wasn't going to release it till the government leaked it, he's not sure who leaked it, he
[2:23:31.260 --> 2:23:37.020]  had copies, so he overnotted it to us, we've been working on it, we tried to blur faces
[2:23:37.020 --> 2:23:40.820]  out and the wrong file played, I mean, just like the government screwed up and didn't
[2:23:40.820 --> 2:23:45.260]  find the DVR to hide this, I kind of, we've got a great crew, but it's like when something's
[2:23:45.260 --> 2:23:48.860]  in a rush, it's like this, like Gremlins invade, it's like Laurel and Hardy, I thought
[2:23:48.860 --> 2:23:53.700]  I had the footage the first hour, we didn't get it till, you know, the end of the second
[2:23:53.700 --> 2:23:59.620]  minute train wreck, which is fine, whatever the point is, is that this is crazy that they're
[2:23:59.620 --> 2:24:03.140]  in public, they're doing this is legal and lawful, I just don't want to show their faces.
[2:24:03.140 --> 2:24:07.980]  At the same time, they've been caught lying, you know, the higher-ups have done this, to
[2:24:07.980 --> 2:24:14.380]  me it's just sensational how this illustrates CNN and collusion with Mueller.
[2:24:14.380 --> 2:24:23.620]  I watched the video on InfoWars and it was quite disgusting and a number of levels. One
[2:24:23.620 --> 2:24:29.740]  of them, as you point out, letting the prostitutes know what's going to be going on before they
[2:24:29.740 --> 2:24:36.020]  even inform his attorneys and treating him like a criminal.
[2:24:36.020 --> 2:24:43.540]  And I'm thinking about all these boys and girls dressed up in their military drag playing
[2:24:43.540 --> 2:24:49.540]  tough guys and tough women with all these weapons that they're carrying and all the
[2:24:49.540 --> 2:24:56.980]  body armor to go arrest a guy like that. And America talks about other countries. Could
[2:24:56.980 --> 2:25:03.660]  you imagine if this happened in Russia, if the Russians did that to somebody that was
[2:25:03.660 --> 2:25:10.100]  speaking out in favor of someone that is like this?
[2:25:10.100 --> 2:25:17.980]  Yeah, again, could you imagine if the Russians did that and we saw a clip and then Roger,
[2:25:17.980 --> 2:25:25.300]  you know, outside with handcuffs behind them, like he's a criminal? So again, what kind
[2:25:25.300 --> 2:25:35.020]  of people would execute this kind of phony order? And that's our FBI? So how low can
[2:25:35.020 --> 2:25:40.940]  you go? Well, they showed you. And the other point I want to make, just listening to that
[2:25:40.940 --> 2:25:46.740]  clip that you were playing, I don't know what arrogant little jerk Congress boy that was
[2:25:46.740 --> 2:25:55.060]  talking. Is this line in the Constitution? Is this line in the Constitution? A lot of
[2:25:55.060 --> 2:26:01.540]  lines aren't in the Constitution. Does the Constitution say that we got a bunch of morons
[2:26:01.540 --> 2:26:05.540]  running the government? We should get them out of there? No, that's not in there. What
[2:26:05.540 --> 2:26:12.780]  kind of questioning is that to say, is this line in the Constitution? It could be any
[2:26:12.780 --> 2:26:19.860]  line you could put in there. What is how stupid they are? And all of this is. And again, I
[2:26:19.860 --> 2:26:24.780]  got my problems with Trump. One of them is what's going on with Venezuela. But that's
[2:26:24.780 --> 2:26:31.500]  all this has been since the beginning of his election is the overthrow of Trump. And that's
[2:26:31.500 --> 2:26:37.540]  all they're wasting America's time, money and energy on rather than putting it into
[2:26:37.540 --> 2:26:45.420]  a positive way and victimizing someone like Roger Stone in a video that clearly shows
[2:26:45.420 --> 2:26:57.500]  the military aspects of our so called protect the police that are supposed to protect us.
[2:26:57.500 --> 2:27:01.180]  And you know, I agree with you because I've read what you said about we don't want to
[2:27:01.180 --> 2:27:05.700]  take over Venezuela because then we own that problem. But their borders collapsing and Russia
[2:27:05.700 --> 2:27:10.860]  and China are trying to manipulate. So so what do you think Trump does about this? Well,
[2:27:10.860 --> 2:27:16.860]  you mind your own business because every every every every every foreign entanglement that
[2:27:16.860 --> 2:27:24.980]  we have gotten into look what they have created. Great job over there in Afghanistan. Oh, wonderful
[2:27:24.980 --> 2:27:31.660]  wonderful over there in Iraq. We're bringing democracy. Hey, how about Libya? Democracy
[2:27:31.660 --> 2:27:38.380]  destroyed the richest country in the region. Oh, how about Syria? Assad has to go. We don't
[2:27:38.380 --> 2:27:43.700]  like what that guy's doing. We're going to bring in democracy. Hey, how about Nicaragua
[2:27:43.700 --> 2:27:49.860]  want to go to Honduras? The real if we go into Venezuela, we've they've already had
[2:27:49.860 --> 2:27:55.900]  about three million people leave the country over the last three years. And you could also
[2:27:55.900 --> 2:28:02.180]  thank Obama's sanctions going back before that that have put pressure. The economic sanctions
[2:28:02.180 --> 2:28:09.340]  are warfare against the people. What are they bringing in a guy like Elliott Abrams, a convicted
[2:28:09.340 --> 2:28:15.580]  war criminal to be the head of bringing democracy there? This is the guy that was championing
[2:28:15.580 --> 2:28:21.020]  what they were doing back in the day with the Iran Contra scandals and other supporters
[2:28:21.020 --> 2:28:29.980]  of people of dictators in that area. No, America only we mind your own business. Stay on.
[2:28:29.980 --> 2:28:33.100]  We'll be right back with Gerald Salienta to get more into where he sees things are going
[2:28:33.100 --> 2:28:37.500]  with Trump. And another clip I just saw during these hearings, where they're acting like
[2:28:37.500 --> 2:28:40.700]  if we stop anybody at the border, it's mass murder, but they don't care about killing
[2:28:40.700 --> 2:28:45.100]  babies after they're born. That's the new Democrat policy will cover it all with Gerald

[2:30:49.500 --> 2:30:55.020]  is named turbo force because it will take you into overdrive. Turbo force at m4slife.com.
[2:30:56.380 --> 2:31:02.700]  At M4s, we're always looking for the very best best selling highest rated products that we can
[2:31:02.700 --> 2:31:07.900]  then private label and sell. Well, there is a national company who has FDA approval to sell
[2:31:07.900 --> 2:31:13.580]  their wound gel that is the strongest out there and we private label it and we sell it for $10
[2:31:13.580 --> 2:31:19.900]  less online than they sell it at CVS and Walgreens. We also have another product also produced by the
[2:31:19.900 --> 2:31:25.740]  same company, immune gargle. We've been selling a lot of the wound gel and a lot of the immune

[2:32:08.460 --> 2:32:12.940]  into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support
[2:32:12.940 --> 2:32:18.700]  your gut health. Mycozx Plus is the result of the search for that formula, a unique natural formula

[2:33:09.180 --> 2:33:22.780]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:25.580 --> 2:33:28.780]  We're going back to Gerald Solentia in a moment. I want to get his take on this before we look at
[2:33:28.780 --> 2:33:35.100]  the 2020 field and the economy and trying to pull trips out of Afghanistan and Syria and being
[2:33:35.100 --> 2:33:39.740]  demonized and attacked where he sees the big nationalist movements, populist movements going,
[2:33:39.740 --> 2:33:45.420]  the yellow vest, so much more, Gerald Solentia in a moment. But here is Congresswoman Jay Appal.
[2:33:46.780 --> 2:33:53.340]  From just minutes ago, I told you about it. How dare you? The children are crying. Meanwhile,
[2:33:53.340 --> 2:33:58.220]  people show up like seven or eight adults, 20 kids. No one knows who's who. They have no ID.
[2:33:58.220 --> 2:34:05.500]  It was the ACLU sued back under Bush like 15 years ago and said,
[2:34:05.500 --> 2:34:09.260]  you've got to separate kids from adults. And they just lie about this and say,
[2:34:09.260 --> 2:34:13.900]  it's Trump and we've made conditions better. And even the Senate report said a lot of kids
[2:34:13.900 --> 2:34:17.980]  going to sex slavery who weren't checked. And she just sits here in this big act.
[2:34:18.780 --> 2:34:23.420]  Well, the Democrats won't stand when Trump says let's not abort babies after they're born.
[2:34:23.420 --> 2:34:29.580]  So beyond pro live pro choice. I mean, that's where we've gotten. They can't have the cake
[2:34:29.580 --> 2:34:36.700]  and eat it too. So here it is. Being with us, our country is still reeling from the
[2:34:36.700 --> 2:34:41.660]  horrors of family separation that occurred at the border. I was the first member of Congress to
[2:34:41.660 --> 2:34:47.340]  talk to hundreds of women and men who had been ripped apart. The hundreds of thousands killed
[2:34:47.340 --> 2:34:53.900]  Mexico detention, federal prison to talk to those women. Many of them had not told them would end
[2:34:53.900 --> 2:34:59.340]  our civilization if she could. They sat in the room next door as they heard their children yelling
[2:34:59.340 --> 2:35:04.700]  for them. And they were not able to go and speak to their children. These people are sick for weeks.
[2:35:04.700 --> 2:35:11.740]  They didn't know where their children were. Shouldn't have let them across the desert with no ID.
[2:35:11.740 --> 2:35:17.100]  I mean, people commit these huge crimes and the left bitches and complaints and gets on our
[2:35:17.100 --> 2:35:21.900]  face. It tries to make us guilty. And they're just a group of child trafficking monsters.
[2:35:23.580 --> 2:35:31.100]  Let's continue. These women, most of the men were seeking asylum and your department,
[2:35:31.100 --> 2:35:37.340]  instead of allowing them their legal right to seek asylum, your department instead imposed
[2:35:37.340 --> 2:35:44.140]  a zero humanity policy to pause again. The UN broke Europe. They're breaking us, organizing
[2:35:44.140 --> 2:35:48.300]  millions to invade. We're almost all military age men that use a few kids as shields.
[2:35:48.300 --> 2:35:51.740]  They meant to overwhelm the judges and collapse the country. This is the plan.
[2:35:52.860 --> 2:35:56.540]  And this woman knows it. Let's continue and get girls on the estate. Go ahead.
[2:35:58.540 --> 2:36:02.860]  Proceedings resulting in the U.S. government tearing thousands of children from their moms
[2:36:02.860 --> 2:36:07.900]  and dads. And this is still happening. And the truth is we may not know how many children
[2:36:07.900 --> 2:36:13.740]  were separated from their parents. So Mr. Whitaker, you were Attorney General Chief
[2:36:13.740 --> 2:36:16.860]  former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Chief of Staff at the time. Is that correct?
[2:36:18.140 --> 2:36:22.860]  Of the zero tolerance policy being implemented. You were his Chief of Staff at the time.
[2:36:22.860 --> 2:36:27.020]  At what point time? I was at the family separation policy. Let me just tell you.
[2:36:27.020 --> 2:36:31.580]  I'm sorry. There was no family separation policy. You were tolerance policy.
[2:36:31.580 --> 2:36:35.740]  This has been given four Pinocchio's multiple times. I'm just going to tell you,
[2:36:35.740 --> 2:36:39.900]  you were former Attorney General Chief of Staff at the time. Last month, Senator Merkley.
[2:36:39.900 --> 2:36:43.900]  Hit pause again. I'm going to go to Joel on this. They have this thing where, oh, Snopes
[2:36:43.900 --> 2:36:48.060]  or one of our paid groups says you're a Pinocchio. Like if Whitaker goes the sky's blue,
[2:36:48.060 --> 2:36:51.500]  they go, no, it's not. We have a group says four Pinocchio's.
[2:36:53.740 --> 2:37:01.100]  Then go move to Mexico or Venezuela, you dumb ignorant blob. Stop coming here and just bitching
[2:37:01.100 --> 2:37:04.620]  that we're the most open country in the world and trying to shame us because you want to use
[2:37:04.620 --> 2:37:11.500]  our Christian ethos against it. You ugly witch. Go back to her. By senior officials at the
[2:37:11.500 --> 2:37:16.540]  Department of Justice and Homeland Security outlining policies to separate children from
[2:37:16.540 --> 2:37:23.020]  their families. Were you aware of this memo at the time? No. So as the Chief of Staff,
[2:37:23.020 --> 2:37:31.820]  you were not aware of what your boss was doing. Was the memo, I'm sorry, was are you talking about
[2:37:31.820 --> 2:37:37.260]  the leaked memo or the memo that General Sessions issued? There was a leak draft memo by senior
[2:37:37.260 --> 2:37:41.340]  officials at the Department of Justice. You were the Chief of Staff. I would think you would know
[2:37:41.340 --> 2:37:45.660]  and you would be a senior official. You would know about that memo. The memo stated
[2:37:45.660 --> 2:37:52.140]  that a policy of criminally prosecuting parents would require close coordination between DHS
[2:37:52.140 --> 2:37:55.980]  and the Department of Health and Human Services, which would be tasked with housing children
[2:37:55.980 --> 2:38:01.340]  separated from their moms and dads. And yet a report released by the Government Accountability
[2:38:01.340 --> 2:38:09.100]  Office last October says that DHS and HHS were quote, unaware. That's enough for her. So again,
[2:38:09.100 --> 2:38:12.460]  just we have a totally open border. Do whatever you want. This is a total joke.
[2:38:13.260 --> 2:38:16.140]  And Gerald, I appreciate you joining us. You got a lot to cover when we come back next segment.
[2:38:16.140 --> 2:38:21.340]  But just on this whole subject, what do you make of this? Well, again, you know, we
[2:38:22.540 --> 2:38:29.980]  one of our top trends for 2019 is human waves. And you're looking at Latin America for Central
[2:38:29.980 --> 2:38:37.900]  America over according to a Gallup poll survey, nearly 27 percent of the people want to leave
[2:38:37.900 --> 2:38:43.820]  those regions because of the violence, the corruption, and the inability to get any jobs.
[2:38:43.820 --> 2:38:51.100]  So let's go back. How to stop it? Number one goes back to Occupy Peace, the movement that I've
[2:38:51.100 --> 2:38:57.340]  started, OccupyPeace.com. Close all the bases overseas and bring the troops back
[2:38:57.340 --> 2:39:04.460]  to protect the homeland. That's the first thing. Number two, I suggested this is my
[2:39:04.460 --> 2:39:10.860]  suggestion on how to solve this problem. Let the people vote. And it's a very simple referendum.
[2:39:11.500 --> 2:39:19.980]  Do you want to spend X billions of dollars to construct a wall? You have yes or no. Or B,
[2:39:19.980 --> 2:39:27.980]  you could say yes or no. Or B, yes, I want to bring in more refugees and immigrants.
[2:39:27.980 --> 2:39:36.300]  It will cost me X amount of dollars for each one that comes in. So what I say to people,
[2:39:36.300 --> 2:39:42.860]  if you want to house them, if you want to educate them, if you want to take care of their health
[2:39:42.860 --> 2:39:50.060]  care, if you want to feed them, then that's your choice. But don't tell me that I have to do the
[2:39:50.060 --> 2:39:58.220]  same thing. So I'm saying, I believe we should have a national referendum. Open the borders
[2:39:58.220 --> 2:40:05.340]  or close the borders. It's as simple as that. And by the way, how come we don't hear this kind
[2:40:05.340 --> 2:40:10.140]  of vitriol coming from that congresswoman about what they're doing in Hungary, what they're doing
[2:40:10.140 --> 2:40:14.300]  in Austria, what they're doing in Poland, what they're doing in the Czech Republic, what they're
[2:40:14.300 --> 2:40:19.740]  now doing in Italy, they cannot, they don't want other people coming in until they could take care
[2:40:19.740 --> 2:40:25.100]  of their own. Oh, and I forgot Germany. And you look what happened to Angela Merkel because she
[2:40:25.100 --> 2:40:30.380]  allowed some 2 million refugees come in. And now you can see the other movements going on against
[2:40:30.380 --> 2:40:36.220]  it. So what I'm saying is, who are these people, these little privileged people to tell us what
[2:40:36.220 --> 2:40:41.980]  to do? Let the people vote. If we could bank online, we could vote online. This should be a
[2:40:41.980 --> 2:40:49.020]  referendum of the American people, not the political interests. And you forgot Brazil,
[2:40:49.020 --> 2:40:53.740]  Italy, Brazil's closed its borders with Venezuela. I mean, you've got collapsing countries on your
[2:40:53.740 --> 2:41:00.460]  border. You can't let that happen. Exactly. And again, all these people that congresswoman,
[2:41:00.460 --> 2:41:07.260]  hey, you, bring in a family, bring in the many people as you want, you pay for their education,
[2:41:07.260 --> 2:41:14.460]  you feed them, you house them, and you pay for their health care. So unless you do that,
[2:41:14.460 --> 2:41:20.940]  don't give me your BS because talk is cheap. Put your money where your mouth is, Gapis.
[2:41:23.020 --> 2:41:26.780]  Well, we know the UN's using third world populations as an invasion force. And
[2:41:26.780 --> 2:41:32.140]  I don't blame people wanting to come here. The difference is we don't have an educational system
[2:41:32.140 --> 2:41:36.940]  that can deprogram these people. And they're all voting for socialism, basically. And that's
[2:41:36.940 --> 2:41:40.540]  the crisis. We're going to come back, Gerald. I want to get your take on the 2020 field.
[2:41:40.540 --> 2:41:43.100]  I think you've got some private predictions. I don't know if you want to share those yet about
[2:41:43.100 --> 2:41:49.900]  who you think their golden man or woman is and what you think Trump should do on many fronts
[2:41:49.900 --> 2:41:53.900]  because I'm critical on Trump not fighting internet censorship. And, you know, I agree,
[2:41:53.900 --> 2:41:58.540]  we shouldn't go take over Venezuela, but if it collapses, what do you do? I want to ask you,
[2:41:58.540 --> 2:42:03.660]  we'll just starting now, though, it is good that he tried to get out of Afghanistan and Syria, but
[2:42:03.660 --> 2:42:08.460]  then the government and both parties threatened to impeach him and just say no. I mean, that talk
[2:42:08.460 --> 2:42:15.340]  about deep state, my goodness. What do you think about that as we go to break? I mean, just the
[2:42:15.340 --> 2:42:21.980]  refusal. Again, it is the deep state. They don't want it. And they don't want to do a lot of the
[2:42:21.980 --> 2:42:29.660]  things that that he wants. And it's very clear with Afghanistan and Syria. And so again, go back
[2:42:29.660 --> 2:42:36.220]  to the first day he was elected the headline in USA Today, New President wins with 74 lawsuits
[2:42:36.220 --> 2:42:41.660]  or something like that. It's been an attack on Trump since the beginning, because he has
[2:42:41.660 --> 2:42:48.060]  really destroyed both political parties in so many ways. And he's the forerunner of the populist
[2:42:48.060 --> 2:42:52.300]  movement. That's right. And it's it's happening all the world. So good things are happening all the
[2:42:52.300 --> 2:43:00.460]  world. For those looking for the ultimate source of energy for their day, every day,

[2:44:00.300 --> 2:44:06.380]  And I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most varied,
[2:44:06.380 --> 2:44:14.700]  the most suppressed. And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night, all the arrogant,
[2:44:15.260 --> 2:44:20.060]  leftist authoritarians like the young turds and others get so butt hurt when Trump won.
[2:44:21.260 --> 2:44:25.980]  They don't want us to have that victory. They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[2:44:27.180 --> 2:44:31.580]  And that's why the globalist Hillary and others are trying to shut in fours down.

[2:47:55.180 --> 2:48:03.100]  hired a lot of yesh men and a lot of cowards to work for them. And only because of personal
[2:48:03.100 --> 2:48:06.940]  experience growing up when I was a kid and other things, I've known FBI agents that were like
[2:48:06.940 --> 2:48:12.940]  baseball team coaches and super nice and worked 12 hours a day, 14 hours a day, trying to stop money
[2:48:12.940 --> 2:48:20.300]  wanders and bank robbers. But those are the guys and gals that never move up. People at the top
[2:48:20.300 --> 2:48:27.660]  are the worst mafia, not just this country, but the world has ever seen. And I have experienced it.
[2:48:28.940 --> 2:48:33.500]  I mean, I've gotten good information from FBI agents and federal marshals that was national news.
[2:48:33.500 --> 2:48:42.540]  And I've also had them try to set me up. But it was always special political crony groups.
[2:48:43.580 --> 2:48:49.260]  And if we could just clean those out, we'd have a better start. But let me tell you something,
[2:48:49.260 --> 2:48:54.220]  when you get the raw footage of CNN setting up and being directed by the FBI like a Steven
[2:48:54.220 --> 2:48:59.820]  Spielberg movie and only got it at 9am this morning. It was FedEx to me overnight. We were
[2:48:59.820 --> 2:49:04.460]  here waiting. We thought the truck would come at 10. It came at like 9.15. We ran in. There was,
[2:49:05.500 --> 2:49:12.860]  a ton of it. And then there's the train wreck of trying to grab it and blow people's faces. And
[2:49:12.860 --> 2:49:19.580]  then just all of it, it drives me crazy. But you're sitting there. And I didn't want to believe
[2:49:19.580 --> 2:49:23.980]  their patent. The camera guy on the back, I didn't want to believe they lied and violated federal
[2:49:23.980 --> 2:49:29.740]  law and released an indictment before they should, even though they messed up and sent it to Roger
[2:49:29.740 --> 2:49:35.020]  and CNN had the day stamp a day before, before the grand jury even actually built it. CNN had it.
[2:49:35.980 --> 2:49:42.620]  So CNN is just such at the heart of this. And the raw video, the articles are now on info wars.com.
[2:49:43.500 --> 2:49:47.900]  If you want to go see those for yourself. And I noticed this has been out a few hours, no coverage.
[2:49:49.660 --> 2:49:54.380]  You'd think something like this, like, Hey, here's the raw footage at Roger Stone's house that shows
[2:49:54.380 --> 2:49:58.540]  CNN out there with the FBI directly to the camera. And they're talking and set up the tripod. The
[2:49:58.540 --> 2:50:02.940]  FBI is there pat them on the back. And you'd think like that would be huge. But no,
[2:50:05.180 --> 2:50:09.980]  it's so powerful. They don't, they're all meeting right now and trying to figure out what to do.
[2:50:10.780 --> 2:50:14.620]  An attorney general, acting attorney general Whitaker, you know, said, yeah, we need basically
[2:50:14.620 --> 2:50:20.700]  a criminal investigation of this. That's today before this is out, Gerald. But people understand
[2:50:20.700 --> 2:50:25.420]  like, if I'm going to release something like that, there's no group above me giving me orders.
[2:50:25.420 --> 2:50:33.420]  And it's not legal. No, there should be a criminal investigation. And it is disgusting that they're
[2:50:33.420 --> 2:50:39.180]  in bed with the media. Again, that's why I call them prostitutes. They get paid to put it to get
[2:50:39.180 --> 2:50:45.580]  they get paid to put out. And by their Washington whore masters of corporate johns. And this is
[2:50:45.580 --> 2:50:50.860]  the perfect example of it. This is a disgrace. And again, that the people that executed this,
[2:50:50.860 --> 2:50:55.180]  I mean, how come they didn't fight against their higher up and said, we can't do this. This is
[2:50:55.180 --> 2:51:00.380]  it, right? We're going to arrest the guy certain with a warrant and put on a show like this. Why
[2:51:00.380 --> 2:51:07.100]  are we doing this? So is the morality is what I'm saying. Oh, they're not stopping the smugglers
[2:51:07.100 --> 2:51:11.340]  with kidnapped kids. Oh, leave them alone. No, but some, some guy with no criminal record,
[2:51:11.340 --> 2:51:15.500]  let's stage a whole event to make it look like he's guilty. I mean, you're literally becoming
[2:51:15.500 --> 2:51:21.900]  like dress up people here. Well, that's what they do because the people think, for example,
[2:51:21.900 --> 2:51:28.300]  that an indictment is a judgment. And they keep, you know, that and it's not, but they,
[2:51:28.300 --> 2:51:33.820]  but that's what they do. So it makes it look like he did something wrong. And now he's paying for
[2:51:34.700 --> 2:51:37.500]  well, there's an example of another New York Times article out today. And it's like,
[2:51:38.380 --> 2:51:43.820]  judge rules that Jones has got to show his marketing for Sandy Hook. As if we ever go,
[2:51:43.820 --> 2:51:49.020]  we're going to cover a news article. What's our marketing marketing is a t-shirt or a book or a
[2:51:49.020 --> 2:51:53.340]  video or a water filter. I go out and look, what's the best selling thing? What's really good for
[2:51:53.340 --> 2:51:59.900]  people? What can I buy in mass and undercut the competition? And, but they're like, it's just,
[2:51:59.900 --> 2:52:04.940]  it's like in the court filing, give us the marketing. And they're like, well, the judge will
[2:52:04.940 --> 2:52:08.460]  get mad if you don't give them that marketing. It's like saying, the judge will get mad if you
[2:52:08.460 --> 2:52:12.780]  don't give them that purple unicorn you've got in the back seat, you know, or in the closet.
[2:52:13.340 --> 2:52:17.180]  If you don't give us that Martian you've got, it's like Sandy Hook was barely something we ever
[2:52:17.180 --> 2:52:23.100]  even covered. The media made that who I was, then won't shut up about it. And at the end of the New
[2:52:23.100 --> 2:52:28.780]  York Times, they go, crazy, keep coming after the parents. Jones won't stop. So we've got to take
[2:52:28.780 --> 2:52:33.500]  him out. Meanwhile, for years, I'm like, I thought it happened. Don't go to their houses. But it's,
[2:52:33.500 --> 2:52:37.420]  it's like a unified press involved in fraud. I don't know how you deal with it, Gerald.
[2:52:38.300 --> 2:52:43.100]  Well, you can't. And again, they are involved in fraud. Like, you know, it's a whole different
[2:52:43.100 --> 2:52:48.860]  media out there. What do you have? Six companies control 90% of the media. And you can see their
[2:52:48.860 --> 2:52:54.300]  favoritism, whether it's, you know, Fox on one side, or all the rest on the other side.
[2:52:54.300 --> 2:52:58.940]  So that's all it is. It's the corporate media. There is no free media. And that's why, by the way,
[2:52:58.940 --> 2:53:04.620]  everyone listening should do all you can to support info wars. I buy their products, they're great,
[2:53:04.620 --> 2:53:09.980]  their first class. And if we don't have this, it's going to be a censorship nation. And it's
[2:53:09.980 --> 2:53:14.460]  going on around the world. They're closing down everybody that that that doesn't follow their
[2:53:14.460 --> 2:53:19.740]  pitch. So we're in a very dangerous time. Matter of fact, that's another one of our top trends
[2:53:19.740 --> 2:53:26.700]  for 2019 is censorship 2019. It's only going to get worse. What's going to happen, you think,
[2:53:26.700 --> 2:53:33.020]  with the socialist and like the mainline democratic party now, sounding like Shea Guevara and
[2:53:33.660 --> 2:53:39.180]  Joe Stalin? Well, you know, we were the first magazine to call Donald Trump a winner in May
[2:53:39.180 --> 2:53:46.540]  of 2016. And our forecast of the democratic presidential candidate we're making now. And on
[2:53:46.540 --> 2:53:53.020]  your show, it's going to be Beto O'Rourke. And the reason being you mentioned before about the
[2:53:53.020 --> 2:53:58.780]  socialist thing, that only plays to one audience. Beto O'Rourke is going to be able to get a lot
[2:53:58.780 --> 2:54:04.860]  of young people. Most importantly, I wrote about this in the Trends Journal in 2008,
[2:54:04.860 --> 2:54:10.860]  when Oprah took Obama under her wing. I've been on Oprah twice. I've been on every major media
[2:54:10.860 --> 2:54:17.580]  show, you know, name it from Brian Williams and all of them, you know, and nobody put on a show
[2:54:17.580 --> 2:54:25.500]  like her. No one. She was the queen of TV talk when she took Obama under her wing. And we wrote
[2:54:25.500 --> 2:54:33.500]  about this in the Trends Journal. He knew how to play that act. He never went off script. Guess what?
[2:54:33.500 --> 2:54:41.340]  Oprah just took Beto O'Rourke under her wing, hugged him in front of everybody, had him on
[2:54:41.340 --> 2:54:50.300]  her show. And now you're going to start seeing more and more publicity promoting him. And we had
[2:54:50.300 --> 2:54:55.900]  made this forecast, by the way, I'd sit on David Knight a couple of days ago, to yesterday's New
[2:54:55.900 --> 2:55:03.100]  York Times. And I told my staff this was going to happen on Monday. Yesterday's New York Times,
[2:55:03.100 --> 2:55:11.740]  a front page story of Beto O'Rourke. When he lived in New York, you open it up to the back of full
[2:55:11.740 --> 2:55:20.300]  page. And you know what it's filled with? Nothing. An empty shell. And what they also leave out is
[2:55:20.300 --> 2:55:28.940]  that Beto's dad in law is a billionaire. And they know how to raise money. This is going to be the
[2:55:28.940 --> 2:55:36.700]  white Obama. I agree out of the whole field that they're making the socialists all look terrible.
[2:55:36.700 --> 2:55:43.260]  But meanwhile, he's just as globalist as they are. And Peter O'Rourke in his whole sweaty shirt
[2:55:43.260 --> 2:55:48.860]  routine is fake. Oh, it goes like those like Bernie Sanders. I mean, he is just what a disgusting
[2:55:48.860 --> 2:55:53.340]  joke. There's nothing. You read this article, everybody listening, go to the trend, go to
[2:55:53.340 --> 2:56:00.060]  yesterday's New York Times and read Beto O'Rourke. Nothing. The guy's a total loser of nothing.
[2:56:00.060 --> 2:56:05.740]  If daddy was an important guy over there around where he lived, and his uncle didn't have a place,
[2:56:05.740 --> 2:56:17.260]  this guy was a nobody, a zero. And that's all he is. But hey, Alex Jones, add up Obama. What are
[2:56:17.260 --> 2:56:27.820]  the O's? Obama, zero. A zero nothing community organizer who organized nothing brought in by
[2:56:27.820 --> 2:56:35.260]  the Pritzker family owns the higher chain. A nothing, a nobody. They're doing the same thing
[2:56:35.260 --> 2:56:43.580]  with this nobody, the millennials, the generation Z, all those young people that haven't voted before.
[2:56:43.580 --> 2:56:48.220]  That's who they're going to get out, plus all the other people on the other side.
[2:56:48.220 --> 2:56:54.220]  That's right. They're Beto tests. They're the Beto test. I mean, they almost turned Texas blue.
[2:56:54.220 --> 2:56:59.500]  And now they're going to try to launch Beto. I mean, I agree with you. I think Beto,
[2:57:00.300 --> 2:57:04.620]  even more than Camilla Harris or all these other people, I mean, I think, I think he's their main
[2:57:04.620 --> 2:57:11.500]  weapon. Yep. That's our forecast. He's going to be it. And you're going to start looking at the
[2:57:11.500 --> 2:57:15.900]  start looking at the publicity that he's going to get. Why they put this story in the New York
[2:57:15.900 --> 2:57:22.860]  Times today. It was totally worthless. I'll tell you why because they paid to get it in there
[2:57:22.860 --> 2:57:28.860]  one way or another. Well, he's the anointed serial killer lookalike. I mean, he's he's our God. He's
[2:57:28.860 --> 2:57:34.620]  our Lord. He's totally fake. Gerald Salente, trendsresearch.com. Thank you so much. Great job.
[2:57:34.620 --> 2:57:39.020]  Thank you. Thank you, sir. We've got so much more coming up in the next hour. The big exclusive

[2:58:01.340 --> 2:58:07.340]  drinks and energy supplements. But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic
[2:58:07.340 --> 2:58:12.140]  caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in just a few hours
[2:58:12.140 --> 2:58:16.460]  and have terrible side effects. We have developed hands down from our research,

[2:58:28.060 --> 2:58:32.940]  easy to use packets to mix it with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like. Warning, though,
[2:58:32.940 --> 2:58:37.180]  it's very, very strong. It lasts 10 hours. So take a half packet the first time you take it.

[3:00:10.860 --> 3:00:16.700]  So Roger Stone over a week ago gives the House and Senate Judiciary Committees
[3:00:16.700 --> 3:00:21.980]  the raw footage of the raid on his house, CNN coordinating with the FBI all in video.
[3:00:23.500 --> 3:00:27.420]  Then it gets leaked last night to Sinclair, a small clip. So Roger overnight's
[3:00:28.540 --> 3:00:33.020]  via FedEx and UPS is to be safe. We get the FedEx at like 9.15 a.m.
[3:00:33.820 --> 3:00:39.180]  It's incredible footage. It shows CNN being directed by the FBI, whole thing staged,
[3:00:39.180 --> 3:00:45.100]  absolutely impeaches what they've said. That's been out now for three hours.
[3:00:45.100 --> 3:00:50.140]  We've been covering it at m4store.com and newswars.com, three hours.
[3:00:50.700 --> 3:00:56.540]  And the only place you're seeing it or hearing it is m4store.com
[3:00:59.100 --> 3:01:03.020]  or newswars.com or on this syndicated radio slash TV broadcast.
[3:01:04.300 --> 3:01:06.300]  That's globalist discipline.
[3:01:06.300 --> 3:01:18.700]  Sinclair had somebody in the House or Senate Judiciary leak this footage a little bit of it.
[3:01:19.660 --> 3:01:22.300]  And it was on the news everywhere within an hour.
[3:01:23.740 --> 3:01:26.380]  Release at 4.30 everywhere by 6 o'clock.
[3:01:27.820 --> 3:01:32.060]  Central, we were watching it live time here. This has been out three hours.
[3:01:32.060 --> 3:01:38.060]  The footage posted to m4wars.com, newswars.com. From Roger Stone, it's the raid.
[3:01:38.060 --> 3:01:43.420]  It's CNN being directed by the FBI. It's everything. And they're all sitting around with such control
[3:01:44.220 --> 3:01:54.140]  over Newscore and Time Warner and NBC and all of it. They've got such control
[3:01:55.020 --> 3:02:01.020]  that there's zero coverage. Doesn't matter. They tried to shut us off. They tried to break us down.
[3:02:01.020 --> 3:02:05.100]  We've held on for a year after year in the face of this and just leaning into the attack.
[3:02:05.100 --> 3:02:08.620]  Thanks to your prayers and financial support that you spread in the word.
[3:02:08.620 --> 3:02:14.940]  All those are paramount. The prayers are the top. Spreading the word is the same as funding.
[3:02:14.940 --> 3:02:18.140]  It all goes together like a horse and carriage. You can't have one without the other.
[3:02:18.140 --> 3:02:25.580]  But to sit back and know that the councils of government and the councils of corporations,
[3:02:25.580 --> 3:02:33.340]  they are like, oh, that piece of crap, Jones and Stone, you know, they have, they have done it again.
[3:02:33.900 --> 3:02:38.060]  They have released the footage. I don't have people who do makeup or comb my hair.
[3:02:38.060 --> 3:02:41.420]  Sometimes I might get on there. I'm like, oh my God, my hair is sticking out.
[3:02:42.620 --> 3:02:48.940]  But they're a shift. I mean, imagine this is the FBI caught leaking felony warrants.
[3:02:49.500 --> 3:02:52.700]  This is all illegal. This is them caught lying about it to everybody.
[3:02:52.700 --> 3:02:59.020]  And the footage is all there with the FBI all around the camera guy directing him.
[3:02:59.740 --> 3:03:03.340]  I mean, it is just amazing and them lying about it.
[3:03:05.100 --> 3:03:10.620]  The acting AG was brought up and said he was deeply disturbed by it, deeply disturbed by it.
[3:03:14.220 --> 3:03:18.540]  But again, we're the ones that are willing to release the information.
[3:03:18.540 --> 3:03:25.420]  And that's why if you want somebody to fight and for you to the end, somebody swinging for the fences every time,
[3:03:27.180 --> 3:03:31.260]  it's info wars. And so again, I want to thank all of you for what you've done.
[3:03:31.260 --> 3:03:36.540]  You've taken us together so far. But now is the time to triple and quadruple down.
[3:03:36.540 --> 3:03:41.020]  Just to just to let me know that you're wanting us to keep fighting because,

[3:06:04.220 --> 3:06:09.900]  because the owners of this country don't want that. I'm talking about the real owners now.
[3:06:09.900 --> 3:06:14.540]  The real owners, the big wealthy business interests that control things and make all
[3:06:14.540 --> 3:06:19.020]  the important decisions. Forget the politicians. The politicians are put there to give you the
[3:06:19.020 --> 3:06:27.020]  idea that you have freedom of choice. You don't. You have no choice. You have owners. They own you.
[3:06:28.300 --> 3:06:33.660]  They own everything. They own all the important land. They own and control the corporations.
[3:06:33.660 --> 3:06:37.180]  They've long since bought and paid for the senate, the congress, the state houses and city halls.
[3:06:37.180 --> 3:06:40.940]  They got the judges in their back pockets and they own all the big media companies so they
[3:06:40.940 --> 3:06:45.660]  control just about all of the news and information you get to hear. They got you by the balls.
[3:06:45.660 --> 3:06:53.260]  They want obedient workers, obedient workers. People who are just smart enough to run the
[3:06:53.260 --> 3:06:58.380]  machines and do the paperwork and just dumb enough to passively accept jobs with the lower pay,
[3:06:58.380 --> 3:07:02.700]  the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime and the vanishing pension that
[3:07:02.700 --> 3:07:07.980]  disappears the minute you go to collect it. And now they're coming for your social security money
[3:07:07.980 --> 3:07:14.860]  so they can give it to their criminal friends on wall street. It's a big club and you ain't in it.
[3:07:14.860 --> 3:07:21.580]  You and I are not in the big club. The owners of this country know the truth. It's called the
[3:07:21.580 --> 3:07:27.420]  American dream because you have to be asleep to believe it. But I'll tell you what they don't
[3:07:27.420 --> 3:07:31.980]  want. They don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking. They don't want
[3:07:31.980 --> 3:07:36.700]  well informed, well educated people capable of critical thinking. They're not interested in that.
[3:07:36.700 --> 3:07:45.580]  That doesn't help them. That's against their interest. That's right. That's why they want
[3:07:45.580 --> 3:07:52.780]  in full wars shut down because Trump and others really do want prosperity and we want a big middle
[3:07:52.780 --> 3:07:59.100]  class and we're not trying to transsexualize everybody's kids and then bring in this crap.
[3:07:59.100 --> 3:08:06.780]  America's got cancer. We got to fix it. We've got a special guest house coming up.
[3:08:07.420 --> 3:08:11.340]  I think baggage always does a great job. The next segment I wanted to play this ball.
[3:08:11.340 --> 3:08:16.700]  Lots of report that's up on info wars.com. Then they came for the memes. The next phase of the
[3:08:16.700 --> 3:08:23.260]  war on free speech. It's unbelievable. Yeah, I'm proud that came from me first.
[3:08:23.260 --> 3:08:30.780]  Also, Twitter bans investigation of Jack Dorsey Joe Rogan Bitcoin pumping up scam.
[3:08:30.780 --> 3:08:35.020]  That's a big report up on info wars.com. I mean, it's just, it's just crazy.
[3:08:36.140 --> 3:08:40.540]  How criminal this has gotten. How sick it's gotten and all the cowards batting with the system.
[3:08:41.100 --> 3:08:44.940]  And then a new gun bill would require buyers reveal social media history.
[3:08:44.940 --> 3:08:54.700]  CBS News told you about that, but now it's official. That's in Illinois. Meanwhile,
[3:08:55.980 --> 3:08:59.100]  we've got a bunch of other big articles. This whole Jeff Bezos thing. You know,
[3:08:59.100 --> 3:09:06.860]  I agree with what Jeff Bezos is saying. The threats he was sent by an inquirer does sound
[3:09:06.860 --> 3:09:11.100]  like blackmail. The problem is his publication of Washington Post does that all day long.
[3:09:11.100 --> 3:09:19.020]  And so this thing is going crazy. Now he's claiming some government agency leaked the info.
[3:09:19.020 --> 3:09:26.700]  Oh, Bezos, you don't like government agencies leak, leak you and you're in your Dick Cheney photos.
[3:09:28.380 --> 3:09:33.340]  So yeah, it's weaponized media. It's who these people become. What do you think the Washington Post
[3:09:34.860 --> 3:09:38.140]  all these groups do? They spend all their time trying to wreck independent real media
[3:09:38.140 --> 3:09:43.180]  and they get engaged in criminal activities and what happens to them? They howl and pool
[3:09:44.700 --> 3:09:47.820]  like it's the other world. We're going to go to Paul Wasp's report right now.
[3:09:47.820 --> 3:09:52.540]  Please don't forget we've got some of the biggest sales ever running an infowarstore.com
[3:09:52.540 --> 3:10:00.140]  on Brain Force Plus on Turbo Force on the other great products like the ultimate bone broth formula
[3:10:00.140 --> 3:10:05.260]  without you supporting us. 94% reviews on Turbo Force. We will not be here. So please
[3:10:05.260 --> 3:10:10.860]  go to infowarstore.com or AAA-253-3139 without you. We won't be here. Plus,
[3:10:10.860 --> 3:10:14.300]  these are great products you need. So thank you all for your support. Here's Paul Wasp's report.
[3:10:15.180 --> 3:10:21.180]  So Buzzfeed, which just laid off 15% of its staff. Please, not Buzzfeed. Please, not Buzzfeed.
[3:10:21.180 --> 3:10:26.620]  Please, not Buzzfeed. Depriving as of cutting edge insightful content like this, send out a tweet
[3:10:26.620 --> 3:10:32.780]  lobbying Twitter to ban memes that make fun of Democrats. Yes, really. Twitter is allowing
[3:10:32.780 --> 3:10:36.940]  this altered photo comparing women members of Congress who walk right to the state of the union
[3:10:36.940 --> 3:10:43.420]  to the KKK to circulate on its platform despite its own policy that doesn't allow symbols historically
[3:10:43.420 --> 3:10:48.860]  associated with hate groups. Sitch, please. So I guess that accounts that post symbols
[3:10:48.860 --> 3:10:54.780]  historically associated with hate groups should be banned, right? And who would that include?
[3:10:55.500 --> 3:11:01.900]  Gee, I wonder. Oh yeah, that's right. Buzzfeed. The rules actually state that hateful images are
[3:11:01.900 --> 3:11:07.100]  only banned if they're used to promote racist bigotry. Making fun of Democrats because a lot of them
[3:11:07.100 --> 3:11:14.700]  like to dress up like Klan members isn't racist. Actually dressing up like Klan members is racist.
[3:11:14.700 --> 3:11:19.900]  Under Buzzfeed's ridiculous interpretation of the rules, the very yearbook image that started
[3:11:19.900 --> 3:11:26.060]  the Governor Northam KKK scandal would have been banned. And that's the point. This whole crusade
[3:11:26.060 --> 3:11:32.060]  against memes is just another attempt by the establishment left to de-platform and silence its
[3:11:32.060 --> 3:11:37.580]  political adversaries. When we say the left can't meme, that's not just some overused cliché.
[3:11:37.580 --> 3:11:42.700]  It's science bitches. A study by University College London found that the most effectively
[3:11:42.700 --> 3:11:48.940]  spread memes largely originated in two places, the Donald subreddit and 4chan's poll. The New
[3:11:48.940 --> 3:11:54.460]  York Times admitted that political memes were a major quote tool of influence. Salon.com warned
[3:11:54.460 --> 3:12:00.060]  that quote, the ability of memes to communicate ideology is boundless. The meme makers of this
[3:12:00.060 --> 3:12:05.820]  world are truly the intellectuals of this world. Memes can change history. As Richard Dawkins first
[3:12:05.820 --> 3:12:12.540]  explained, memes are like genes for information and human evolution has been guided as much by memes
[3:12:12.540 --> 3:12:19.500]  as by genes. Memes matter. Memes win elections. That's how memes work. But the left is so entrenched
[3:12:19.500 --> 3:12:24.860]  in political correctness that they've lost their sense of humor and are permanently walking on
[3:12:24.860 --> 3:12:31.020]  eggshells. That's why they're terrible at memes. At best, they're hit and miss. I guess they never
[3:12:31.020 --> 3:12:36.380]  miss, huh? Sorry, couldn't resist. So ask yourself, is it worthwhile for the left to engage in meme
[3:12:36.380 --> 3:12:43.420]  warfare or is it far easier just to ban memes? Why is the EU trying to ram through its meme killing
[3:12:43.420 --> 3:12:49.100]  article 13 legislation? Why is Facebook simultaneously developing algorithms that will detect and
[3:12:49.100 --> 3:12:57.020]  delete offensive memes? Why did Twitter launch a purge of thousands of accounts that adopted the NPC
[3:12:57.020 --> 3:13:18.380]  meme? If you can't censor them for what they say, censor them for what they meme. Why are
[3:13:18.380 --> 3:13:23.660]  prominent personalities on Twitter having their accounts locked for tweeting the hashtag learn
[3:13:23.660 --> 3:13:29.580]  to code meme? Basically, we're approaching the day where anything that hurts the fee fees of left
[3:13:29.580 --> 3:13:35.660]  wing digital journalists is a bannable offense. They're so precious, so emotionally incapable
[3:13:35.660 --> 3:13:41.180]  of handling banter, they run to the hall monitor and start crying at the drop of a hat. Why did
[3:13:41.180 --> 3:13:47.820]  Twitter suspend James Woods for posting a satirical political meme? Why did CNN threaten to dox
[3:13:47.820 --> 3:13:54.620]  the creator of the Trump wrestling meme? Why was Alexandria Ocasio Cortez so salty over Donald
[3:13:54.620 --> 3:14:00.300]  Trump Jr posting a meme about her that she threatened him with her subpoena power? Weird
[3:14:00.300 --> 3:14:07.020]  flex, but okay. Why did Sweden's advertising agency try to ban sexist memes? Why did Spain try
[3:14:07.020 --> 3:14:12.620]  to ban memes that were insulting to politicians? Why is the media constantly trying to tear down
[3:14:12.620 --> 3:14:18.060]  the host of meme review? Everybody's favorite show. Why are they even blaming memes for childhood
[3:14:18.060 --> 3:14:25.980]  obesity? Why has the legacy media whipped up a contrived moral panic over memes? Because they
[3:14:25.980 --> 3:14:32.860]  don't understand the language of memes. They can't engage in memetic warfare. So far simpler to abuse
[3:14:32.860 --> 3:14:38.700]  their power to lobby for memes to be censored. And in case you forgot, last year, Big Tech banned
[3:14:38.700 --> 3:14:46.860]  the biggest living meme on the planet. While on the other hand, the left is so full of deranged
[3:14:46.860 --> 3:14:52.780]  salty psychos that through sheer weight of numbers alone, negative self-owning memes are
[3:14:52.780 --> 3:15:06.460]  generated on a routine basis. Excuse me, it's ma'am. It is ma'am. Every time one of these characters
[3:15:06.460 --> 3:15:12.220]  has a public temper tantrum, it's a memetic victory for the right. I mean, when your behavior turns
[3:15:12.220 --> 3:15:18.860]  even warmongering neocon Lindsey Graham into based Lindsey Graham, that's when you know you're losing
[3:15:18.860 --> 3:15:24.940]  the meme war. You ugly. So Buzzfeed, Huffington Post, vice journalists, instead of relying on your
[3:15:24.940 --> 3:15:31.180]  sycophantic handing glove circle jerk with Big Tech, instead of running whimpering to the Twitter
[3:15:31.180 --> 3:15:36.140]  hall monitors every time a meme hurts your feelings, instead of trying to censor memes and
[3:15:36.140 --> 3:15:42.300]  have their creators banned, instead of trying to crap all over fun like the joyless pearl clutches
[3:15:42.300 --> 3:15:51.180]  you are, forget learn to code. How about learn to meme? Stay with us, Dr. Nick Beggar, straight ahead.

[3:20:47.100 --> 3:20:50.940]  governance and politics because a couple of things have jumped out to me recently that
[3:20:52.540 --> 3:21:03.580]  really illustrate sort of the all-time low in which much of governance has fallen. But I want
[3:21:03.580 --> 3:21:07.740]  to start historically. I want to give a little bit of background on me again, but I want to talk
[3:21:07.740 --> 3:21:14.380]  about this kind of overlap of some of the issues from a personal perspective. My grandparents
[3:21:14.380 --> 3:21:19.500]  and my great grandparents on my mother's side were immigrants coming into the United States. My
[3:21:19.500 --> 3:21:26.300]  grandfather and grandmother on my father's side immigrated from Southern Europe, from Croatia,
[3:21:26.300 --> 3:21:31.660]  what was formerly Yugoslavia. Originally Croatia, you know, things kind of changed around quite a
[3:21:31.660 --> 3:21:38.620]  bit in Europe over the decades and even centuries. But they came here on my grandfather 1906. He was
[3:21:38.620 --> 3:21:44.460]  16. He went to work in the mines. He built the life here. And my son kind of brought this to my
[3:21:44.460 --> 3:21:52.700]  attention recently. My oldest son is 43. And what he said is, you know, those early pictures of
[3:21:52.700 --> 3:21:59.740]  immigrants, you know, Italian children, Croatian children, Irish children, they were always waving
[3:21:59.740 --> 3:22:05.820]  flags if you ever go back and look. And the interesting thing is they were generally almost
[3:22:05.820 --> 3:22:09.580]  always, in fact, always, I can't remember otherwise, they were always American flags.
[3:22:10.220 --> 3:22:16.620]  And people were happy, privileged, excited. Yeah, there's an image up now, you know, excited
[3:22:17.180 --> 3:22:26.940]  to come into the United States. You know, it was like the golden opportunity of a global lifetime
[3:22:26.940 --> 3:22:32.140]  for anyone on the planet 100 years ago. People weren't breaking in the back door.
[3:22:32.140 --> 3:22:37.340]  They were coming through Ellis Island. They were coming in the front door. And really proud and
[3:22:37.340 --> 3:22:43.500]  privileged to integrate into this culture. I think of my grandparents. You know, my grandparents
[3:22:43.500 --> 3:22:50.860]  did not speak very good English, but they absolutely forbid their four children from speaking
[3:22:50.860 --> 3:22:55.020]  anything but English, even though the whole neighborhood, because everyone kind of clustered
[3:22:55.020 --> 3:23:00.140]  together from the various countries of people came from much in the same way they do in immigrant
[3:23:00.140 --> 3:23:06.140]  in immigrant communities today. But in those days, the children weren't allowed to speak,
[3:23:06.940 --> 3:23:13.020]  at least in my dad's household, Serbo Croatian or Croatian, because they were going to be
[3:23:13.020 --> 3:23:17.820]  Americans. Now, my dad grew up and he understood every word of Croatian, but even as an adult,
[3:23:17.820 --> 3:23:21.740]  he couldn't speak it because he knew he'd get in trouble for it. You know, I think about that.
[3:23:22.940 --> 3:23:27.020]  But that's kind of the backdrop of it. You know, and I think about even the Pledge of
[3:23:27.020 --> 3:23:33.180]  Allegiance, you know, Pledge of Allegiance to the flag and the United States of America,
[3:23:33.180 --> 3:23:38.700]  which is kind of, you know, sort of the foundation of all this. And then the next line, the last
[3:23:38.700 --> 3:23:44.380]  line, you know, for the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible. You
[3:23:44.380 --> 3:23:50.140]  know, and that's kind of interesting when you think of identity politics today and how counter
[3:23:50.140 --> 3:23:56.620]  that even runs to that basic Pledge of Allegiance, you know, indivisible, a nation together, you know,
[3:23:57.500 --> 3:24:05.020]  with liberty and justice, really, justice for all. Is that really true today, justice for all?
[3:24:05.020 --> 3:24:10.780]  I mean, think about it. In the court system, if it's a criminal matter or a civil matter,
[3:24:11.340 --> 3:24:18.140]  like what Alex is facing right now, it's a million-dollar equation to have justice for
[3:24:18.140 --> 3:24:23.980]  the very foundation of what we are as Americans, the right to free speech, the First Amendment
[3:24:23.980 --> 3:24:31.900]  right to free speech. You know, and I think about all this in the backdrop of the nonsense about
[3:24:31.900 --> 3:24:36.220]  immigration and leadership. And I think about my own family's history. You know, my dad
[3:24:37.500 --> 3:24:44.300]  was born during the Depression years. And, you know, so here you are, you arrive as an immigrant.
[3:24:44.300 --> 3:24:49.500]  You're working underground mines you're making in those days a dollar a day, which was great. I mean,
[3:24:49.500 --> 3:24:56.060]  he had a chance, you know. He built this house with his hands on property owned by the mining
[3:24:56.060 --> 3:25:01.820]  company, which later became USS Steel. In fact, up until he died, he was on that property. When
[3:25:01.820 --> 3:25:06.700]  he died, they tore down his house, the last house standing, because it was mining property.
[3:25:06.700 --> 3:25:12.300]  After all, they never even owned it. And he lived into his 90s. You know, he lived 80 years in
[3:25:12.300 --> 3:25:17.660]  the United States. But when I think about all that, you know, my dad grew up proud to be an
[3:25:17.660 --> 3:25:23.580]  American. He loved history. He was a very brilliant guy. In European history, Russian history,
[3:25:23.580 --> 3:25:29.420]  American history, those were his specialties. And he loved the idea of governance, the idea
[3:25:29.420 --> 3:25:34.380]  and him being born here, first generation, the idea that he could actually make a difference
[3:25:34.380 --> 3:25:40.380]  in the world, do something in the world. And he left Minnesota where he lived in his early 20s,
[3:25:40.380 --> 3:25:48.700]  moved to Alaska, which was truly a frontier place in the mid 50s. This was a rough place to land.
[3:25:49.420 --> 3:25:54.860]  And he landed here the next year, brought my mother up a few years before statehood. And then
[3:25:54.860 --> 3:26:00.940]  my dad's six children, my dad and mom's six children were born here in Alaska. I went,
[3:26:00.940 --> 3:26:06.540]  it was still a territory, my sister also. You know, when we watched this place change and grow and
[3:26:06.540 --> 3:26:10.620]  the governance of Alaska was so different than, you know, I mean, there were Republicans and
[3:26:10.620 --> 3:26:16.300]  Democrats and people fought like crazy over foundational issues like a state constitution,
[3:26:16.300 --> 3:26:22.460]  like how the government was going to be constructed, you know, we were the last group to do this. My
[3:26:22.460 --> 3:26:30.300]  generation literally grew up in that environment, the environment of a frontier state within a
[3:26:30.300 --> 3:26:37.980]  frontier nation. We were the last to hang on to the foundation of our value system,
[3:26:38.700 --> 3:26:43.420]  which has been a big part of my private conversations these days, because that's what
[3:26:43.420 --> 3:26:51.500]  should drive government. That's what should drive the legacy that we're going to leave behind for
[3:26:51.500 --> 3:26:59.660]  our grandchildren and children. Good governance is what it was about in my father's day. And I'm
[3:26:59.660 --> 3:27:06.220]  going to dedicate this entire Friday afternoon to this because it is what it's about. You know,
[3:27:06.220 --> 3:27:11.100]  when I think back again on my dad, you know, he started as a school teacher. My dad couldn't afford
[3:27:11.100 --> 3:27:17.180]  to go to college, all right, for four years. So he had to get a four-year degree in two years,
[3:27:17.180 --> 3:27:22.140]  because that's what he could afford. And that's what he did. He doubled the load, finished,
[3:27:22.140 --> 3:27:31.260]  top in his class, a four-year degree at 20, and started teaching. And he came to Alaska. He was
[3:27:31.260 --> 3:27:36.220]  at first, he worked as an inspector on federal projects. There's an image of my dad. He died
[3:27:36.220 --> 3:27:44.060]  actually at 40. I about lived him now by 20 years. But when I look at dad, you know, his history here,
[3:27:44.060 --> 3:27:49.340]  he came up pretty simple guy, you know, and then he became, after being a federal inspector,
[3:27:49.340 --> 3:27:53.100]  as long as he could stomach it until he could get a teaching job, he went into teaching. He then
[3:27:53.100 --> 3:27:58.780]  was a boys' counselor when they segregated boys and girls' counselors. He was then a principal,
[3:27:59.660 --> 3:28:05.660]  and then a superintendent of schools at 26 years old. And then from there, the state senate, and
[3:28:05.660 --> 3:28:11.740]  then on to the United States Congress. And in all of that, he dealt with a lot of fights, a lot of
[3:28:11.740 --> 3:28:17.980]  things. They tried to stomp him down in so many ways because dad believed in government. He believed
[3:28:17.980 --> 3:28:24.300]  in government of the people, by the people, and for the people. He grew up dirt poor, like a lot
[3:28:24.300 --> 3:28:29.660]  of people have in this country, and understood what it was to struggle, what it was to build,
[3:28:29.660 --> 3:28:34.140]  and what it was to be proud of the country that you're in. We're headed into the break. This is

[3:31:16.860 --> 3:31:22.060]  We struggled here, we made it, and that's really where this goes. God's got a big war for you,
[3:31:22.060 --> 3:31:27.020]  Reddy. And so if you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong,
[3:31:27.020 --> 3:31:31.980]  are you going to really be able to face the other stuff? Because God wants warriors that are smart
[3:31:31.980 --> 3:31:36.060]  and are ready to build things and are also ready to fight. You don't go to the next level without
[3:31:36.060 --> 3:31:39.100]  getting a big weight put on your back. And I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to me in the
[3:31:39.100 --> 3:31:44.380]  future. I mean, all I know is I want to go with the Master Build. I want to go to the next level.
[3:31:44.380 --> 3:31:49.740]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced, not these devil worshipers. They're cold and
[3:31:49.740 --> 3:31:56.860]  failed and feels like being in a tomb. I want life. I want Jesus. Wars are like 12-round heavyweight
[3:31:57.660 --> 3:32:03.580]  boxing championship fights. It's about who wants it, who's prepared to go the longest,
[3:32:03.580 --> 3:32:08.940]  and who's ready to do the damage. We took on Hillary Clinton. We stopped her. We got a national
[3:32:08.940 --> 3:32:15.020]  stand. Nationalists are getting elected all over the world right now. We are winning. But those of
[3:32:15.020 --> 3:32:20.380]  us who are at the very front line at the tip of the spear are under unprecedented attack. So I come
[3:32:20.380 --> 3:32:25.980]  to you each day and try to explain to you that this is a war of attrition. This is about who wants it
[3:32:25.980 --> 3:32:31.420]  most. And you know the persecution, the censorship, the sponsors, they've taken everything. I am in

[3:33:08.060 --> 3:33:21.980]  The Alex Jones show, because there is a war on for your mind with Nick Begich.
[3:33:26.540 --> 3:33:34.380]  And welcome back to this fourth hour of the Alex Jones show m4worshore.com. This is Nick Begich.
[3:33:34.380 --> 3:33:39.820]  Today, coming into this, you know, kind of talking about my own personal family history
[3:33:39.820 --> 3:33:45.500]  and the backdrop of the immigration issues on governance, on discourse, if you will,
[3:33:45.500 --> 3:33:53.100]  within the country right now. You know, this is not a dignified discourse on any level. You know,
[3:33:53.100 --> 3:33:58.060]  my dad, again, and going back to my dad, a student of history, American history, Russian history,
[3:33:58.060 --> 3:34:04.300]  and European history, my dad was a genius, encyclopedic. He could rattle off the history of these
[3:34:04.300 --> 3:34:09.900]  countries going back centuries and the details and the politics all the way up into the current
[3:34:09.900 --> 3:34:15.180]  frame and the overlaps. That's just the way he approached things. And he was the ability,
[3:34:15.980 --> 3:34:22.140]  multi-interested background, much in the same way as my brothers and sisters I have developed
[3:34:22.140 --> 3:34:29.500]  over the years. But when you think about the mindset was this was the nation of total opportunity,
[3:34:29.500 --> 3:34:35.500]  the one oasis on the planet for freedom and liberty and justice. And people believed it,
[3:34:35.500 --> 3:34:40.460]  and it actually, for the most part, got delivered. And we got better at it over the last couple of
[3:34:40.460 --> 3:34:46.940]  centuries as a nation. And we continue to get better at it. But what has happened is the hijacking
[3:34:46.940 --> 3:34:53.820]  of the nation on so many levels. I think back on my dad, you know, as a teenager, young kid,
[3:34:53.820 --> 3:34:59.900]  listening to the arguments that adults would have over the radio broadcasts or the latest news,
[3:34:59.900 --> 3:35:05.580]  and he would listen carefully, and he kept detailed maps during World War II, where we were, and
[3:35:05.580 --> 3:35:11.500]  where the access and the allies had moved in combat, and so on, both in the Pacific and in
[3:35:11.500 --> 3:35:18.220]  Europe. And he followed all of that. And it was part of the dialogue among people, a real conversation
[3:35:18.860 --> 3:35:26.220]  was happening among the people, for the people, by the people, of the people. This is the way my
[3:35:26.220 --> 3:35:32.700]  father grew up, understanding governance. And that's the way I grew up. And my children grow up,
[3:35:32.700 --> 3:35:38.380]  and my grandchildren now are growing up. And as I look at that multi-generational overlay
[3:35:38.380 --> 3:35:44.700]  of what the American value system was based on, this is what we're losing presently.
[3:35:45.900 --> 3:35:51.900]  I have a couple of video clips that I pulled recently, and asked the guys in the team to
[3:35:51.900 --> 3:35:56.940]  pull together of Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the Democratic Party. Now, let me roll back a little
[3:35:56.940 --> 3:36:01.900]  bit further. Now, when my dad was in the Congress in the early 70s before he disappeared, and without
[3:36:01.900 --> 3:36:07.020]  getting into that history today, but when he disappeared off the face of the earth, Don Young
[3:36:07.020 --> 3:36:14.060]  came in in a special election, Don Young, who was the longest living, longest in history serving
[3:36:14.060 --> 3:36:19.180]  United States congressman from Alaska. And he's in the Republican Party. My dad was a Democrat.
[3:36:19.180 --> 3:36:24.780]  If my dad were still in the U.S. House, he would be the Speaker, most likely, probably would have
[3:36:24.780 --> 3:36:29.740]  already been the Speaker. And things would have been a way different ballgame. But the Speaker
[3:36:29.740 --> 3:36:35.820]  of the House today representing the majority party in the United States House. And I don't pick on
[3:36:35.820 --> 3:36:41.100]  people. That is not who I am. But I've got to say, the words coming out, the ideas that are
[3:36:41.100 --> 3:36:48.540]  being expressed by Nancy Pelosi in the next video clip, which deals with the concept of government,
[3:36:48.540 --> 3:36:53.500]  you know, in terms of how do you manipulate the news? How do you create the news, if you will? And
[3:36:53.500 --> 3:37:01.020]  it's things you ran that ran actually on C-SPAN. And no, let's just run the clip. I mean, let's
[3:37:01.020 --> 3:37:09.420]  hear it. Let's go, guys, if you have that ready and we can run it. You demonize, and then you,
[3:37:09.420 --> 3:37:13.900]  we call it the wrap-up smear. If you want to tell the politicians, call it the wrap-up smear.
[3:37:13.900 --> 3:37:21.260]  You smear somebody with falsehoods and all the rest, and then you merchandise it. And then you
[3:37:21.260 --> 3:37:26.140]  write it, and they'll say, see, it's reported in the press that this, this, this, and this,
[3:37:26.140 --> 3:37:32.220]  so they have that validation that the press reported the smear, and then it's called the
[3:37:32.220 --> 3:37:37.020]  wrap-up smear. Now I'm going to merchandise the press's report on the smear that we made.
[3:37:38.700 --> 3:37:45.580]  Now, get that. I'm going to merchandise the lie that we created, that then we make into the news,
[3:37:45.580 --> 3:37:51.500]  is what Nancy Pelosi is saying. And then once it's a news story, we point at it like it's a factual
[3:37:51.500 --> 3:37:57.500]  story, and then just reiterate it over and over again. This is called propaganda. This is what
[3:37:57.500 --> 3:38:05.740]  Adolf Hitler invented in the 1930s and was the master of that kind of thinking. And what Nancy
[3:38:05.740 --> 3:38:14.940]  Pelosi refers to this as a tactic, a tactic to be applied for a government of the people by the
[3:38:14.940 --> 3:38:25.260]  people and for the people. Are you kidding me? My father, my grandfather, my great grandfather
[3:38:25.260 --> 3:38:32.540]  are rolling over in their graves along with the founders of this nation right now, listening to
[3:38:32.540 --> 3:38:39.580]  that as a value statement. Not forget about the words, forget about the whole idea that, okay,
[3:38:39.580 --> 3:38:48.780]  that's the speaker of the United States House of Representatives, a position that should be
[3:38:48.780 --> 3:38:59.500]  respected and respectable. And what are we hearing from the speaker that a tactic of lying
[3:38:59.500 --> 3:39:06.700]  is the way of the world and what she teaches other Democrats as their leader in the U.S. House.
[3:39:06.700 --> 3:39:13.660]  And this should be an affront to every citizen regardless of your political party in this
[3:39:13.660 --> 3:39:23.660]  country. This is not what this nation is about. Lying and manipulating. And how is that expressed
[3:39:23.660 --> 3:39:30.380]  in the last administration? You know, the travel for torture programs run both under Obama and
[3:39:30.380 --> 3:39:35.660]  his predecessor. Oh, we're not going to do every kind of torture. We'll have some new ones. But
[3:39:35.660 --> 3:39:42.460]  you know, think about it, blackmail, extortion, regime change. These are not American ideas.
[3:39:42.460 --> 3:39:49.820]  These are modern ideas put forward by somebody other than you and me as average citizens.
[3:39:49.820 --> 3:39:56.780]  We have been hijacked in the very leadership of these parties. Think they know better and believe
[3:39:56.780 --> 3:40:02.060]  that we are so stupid that we can just be manipulated. There's another segment I want to
[3:40:02.060 --> 3:40:08.060]  run. And it was during the budget conference recently in December. Owen and I were on talking
[3:40:08.060 --> 3:40:13.020]  about this, but I want to run this segment on the budget and the idea of transparency
[3:40:13.020 --> 3:40:18.780]  as we talk about our government today. Can we roll that, guys? We're coming in
[3:40:18.780 --> 3:40:24.940]  in good faith to negotiate with you about how we can keep the government open. We're going to keep
[3:40:24.940 --> 3:40:30.780]  it open if we don't have border security. We're not going to keep it open. We are going to have
[3:40:30.780 --> 3:40:36.220]  border security. And it's the same what you're writing about what has been done. We want to do
[3:40:36.220 --> 3:40:41.900]  the same thing we did last year, this year. That's our proposal. If it's good, then it's good now,
[3:40:41.900 --> 3:40:48.460]  and it won't shut down the government. But that's it. Let's debate in private. Okay? Yeah, let's
[3:40:48.460 --> 3:40:53.820]  debate in private. That is devoid, frankly, of fact, and we can... We need border security. I think
[3:40:53.820 --> 3:40:59.660]  we all agree that we need border security. Now, listen to that. Let's do this in private. Let's
[3:40:59.660 --> 3:41:08.140]  do this in private. Schumer's saying and Pelosi's echoing. Let's do this in private. Let's take the
[3:41:08.140 --> 3:41:14.140]  people's business and shove it in a closet and light up the cigars and make the deal. And
[3:41:16.300 --> 3:41:23.420]  screw America. That's what they're saying. That is what is being said here. It is about
[3:41:24.060 --> 3:41:29.180]  let's all hide in the closet. What is Donald Trump saying? No, no. Let's do this open and
[3:41:29.180 --> 3:41:36.620]  let's do this in the open light of day. Let's have our budget discussions open for the public to
[3:41:36.620 --> 3:41:42.380]  actually see. That's what we need to all get on the phone right now. Look it up. Look up your
[3:41:42.380 --> 3:41:49.020]  congressman's office phone number. Look it up. Call the capital switch board and say, hey,
[3:41:49.740 --> 3:41:54.940]  before you shut this government down again, let's make sure all these so-called negotiations
[3:41:54.940 --> 3:42:03.100]  between the executive and the legislative branch are in the public view, not in a closet,
[3:42:03.980 --> 3:42:12.700]  where you can then create the synthesized news as Pelosi said, we can just lie and throw it out
[3:42:12.700 --> 3:42:16.860]  there and then quote it as the facts. And this is the problem. You know, I was trained as a
[3:42:16.860 --> 3:42:23.340]  negotiator at a point in my career. And one of the key elements of negotiations is honesty.
[3:42:23.340 --> 3:42:28.940]  It's about honesty. You got to know the guy across the table from you is telling the truth
[3:42:29.740 --> 3:42:35.660]  at the end of the day or they're shutting up and we need the truth. That's what makes America free.
[3:42:36.380 --> 3:42:41.580]  That's what is a foundation of liberty and justice is the truth. We're going to be right
[3:42:41.580 --> 3:42:48.700]  back after a few brief messages. This is Dr. Nick Begich with info wars. Pay attention. We're in

[3:47:09.820 --> 3:47:20.300]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones and now your host, Nick Begich.
[3:47:23.420 --> 3:47:30.060]  And welcome back and this is Nick Begich and you know the theme of today's show in fact the title
[3:47:30.060 --> 3:47:37.900]  I told the guys to put on it was a heritage in the republic. You know I mean I come from immigrant
[3:47:37.900 --> 3:47:45.340]  roots. I'm a second generation American like many out there on my father's side,
[3:47:45.340 --> 3:47:52.140]  third generation on my mother's side and you know what I think about you know just the change in the
[3:47:52.140 --> 3:47:57.500]  way people's attitudes are towards not just immigration in general but the attitude of
[3:47:57.500 --> 3:48:01.980]  immigrants when they arrive is so different and it varies with individuals. I have to say that
[3:48:01.980 --> 3:48:08.220]  in all fairness I mean I think when you come in the front door and you get to arrive here
[3:48:09.020 --> 3:48:16.380]  and be a part of what the United States is and what it's becoming is a privilege, an honor
[3:48:17.500 --> 3:48:24.380]  to be welcomed into a country through the front door and you know and maybe we need to look at
[3:48:24.380 --> 3:48:28.860]  those statutes a little closer and see what's happening there and I think that's not always
[3:48:28.860 --> 3:48:33.180]  a bad idea. They need to be reviewed from time to time but in the meanwhile we need to have secure
[3:48:33.180 --> 3:48:38.940]  borders. What I was talking about in sort of the whole governance backdrop again you know
[3:48:39.500 --> 3:48:44.940]  think about this in terms of the changes. The political party of my dad, the democratic party
[3:48:44.940 --> 3:48:51.420]  is now a party about non-citizens which is kind of awkward you know. My dad as a first generation
[3:48:51.420 --> 3:48:55.500]  American would have weighed in heavily on this because he valued the thoughts of immigration
[3:48:55.500 --> 3:49:00.860]  and what the country was founded on and how we built it. You know, Irish were treated badly
[3:49:00.860 --> 3:49:05.820]  when they arrived, the Italians were treated badly when they arrived, you know every group
[3:49:06.460 --> 3:49:10.780]  when they arrived in mass from the various parts of Europe in the world they were treated badly.
[3:49:12.700 --> 3:49:19.740]  That is not an excuse for what's what can happen today but the biggest incoming group are
[3:49:19.740 --> 3:49:25.900]  Latin American descent and the majority population in the United States is Latin American descent
[3:49:25.900 --> 3:49:31.660]  these days. So I don't think the same unwelcome situation is here at all. In fact I think it's
[3:49:31.660 --> 3:49:36.300]  the opposite. I think America has evolved beyond that. It's not about race or nationality or any
[3:49:36.300 --> 3:49:42.860]  of it. It's just about honoring the law and the things that built a nation which is a commonality,
[3:49:42.860 --> 3:49:48.860]  a melting pot of things that evolved from people out into our government expressed in a set of
[3:49:48.860 --> 3:49:53.980]  values. That really has been hijacked and that's what I'm talking about here today. The idea that
[3:49:53.980 --> 3:49:59.340]  the people's business should be in a closet and these are the parties that that talk about
[3:49:59.340 --> 3:50:06.140]  transparency in government. A nice name but not in reality. The only transparency is about you
[3:50:06.140 --> 3:50:12.540]  and me. The only cameras pointed at anyone or said us. The average person being hijacked,
[3:50:12.540 --> 3:50:20.060]  betrayed by a technocracy that has saddled up with big business. That's called fascism. That also
[3:50:20.060 --> 3:50:26.060]  happened in Germany. Read a book. It's old. It's a little dated. It's called ominous parallels
[3:50:26.060 --> 3:50:34.700]  and it's an analogy of the United States and Nazi Germany in the rise of fascism and it's
[3:50:34.700 --> 3:50:40.860]  when government uses the tools of propaganda and lying as Nancy Pelosi said and we played in the
[3:50:40.860 --> 3:50:47.900]  last segment as a policy as a tactic and then you overlay the interest of pharmaceutical industry
[3:50:47.900 --> 3:50:53.020]  and corporations and the wealthy and the elite whether you're a Democrat proposing to be a
[3:50:53.020 --> 3:51:00.460]  representative of the poor innocent masses or Republican. These guys have stolen from us
[3:51:01.180 --> 3:51:07.420]  this Republic and that's what needs to be returned. Not in an act of violence and craziness that we're
[3:51:07.420 --> 3:51:13.660]  seeing from the left, the insanity of it all because by identity politics you abrogate the
[3:51:13.660 --> 3:51:20.380]  melting pot, the co-culture that we've created here as unique in the world and you burn it
[3:51:21.180 --> 3:51:29.500]  on the ground, the flag. Now this is not how Americans and future Americans used to arrive
[3:51:29.500 --> 3:51:37.420]  in the nation and I think that is fundamentally the flaw here is it's a value system that we need
[3:51:37.420 --> 3:51:43.500]  to respect and justice for all. I want to talk about that foundation because we hear a lot about
[3:51:43.500 --> 3:51:51.260]  socialism to these days. Socialize medicine, socialize it, socialize that. Think about justice.
[3:51:51.260 --> 3:51:56.940]  If you're going to socialize anything in this country, how about justice? Access to the court
[3:51:56.940 --> 3:52:04.540]  system on an equal footing where you don't have to sacrifice everything you own for an increment
[3:52:04.540 --> 3:52:12.860]  of justice, right? I mean what's Alex facing right now? Millions in litigation to just have
[3:52:12.860 --> 3:52:18.620]  the right of free speech and his right to be heard, our right to be heard in the world and
[3:52:18.620 --> 3:52:24.540]  invigorate the public debate in the world which is what a free press is about. It's not silencing
[3:52:24.540 --> 3:52:30.700]  speech. It's making sure speech happens. It's making sure the electronic town square of the
[3:52:30.700 --> 3:52:39.180]  21st century is open for everyone, not just those with the approved ideas. This is not
[3:52:39.180 --> 3:52:45.500]  what this republic is about and I can tell you my dad would be opposed to so much of the ideas
[3:52:45.500 --> 3:52:52.460]  that are expressed in this network but I know one thing about my dad. He would fight to the death
[3:52:52.460 --> 3:53:00.460]  for my right and Alex's right and everybody else's right to the opportunity to speak freely about
[3:53:00.460 --> 3:53:08.140]  these ideas because that's the kind of man he was because it was about values first and ideas
[3:53:08.140 --> 3:53:12.940]  were the realm of public discussion debate where either he was going to become enlightened and
[3:53:12.940 --> 3:53:19.100]  change his view and he did on a lot of issues over his career because he gained information
[3:53:19.100 --> 3:53:23.660]  and understood it and then he could make a different decision because it filled in the blanks.
[3:53:23.660 --> 3:53:29.660]  He was a great debater because he listened for the holes where was information missing
[3:53:30.220 --> 3:53:36.060]  or where was the information I needed to contribute lacking so a dialogue could happen. I want to
[3:53:36.060 --> 3:53:41.900]  talk about how the congress was configured in the early 70s. In those days families all went
[3:53:41.900 --> 3:53:48.140]  to DC and we lived in either Maryland or northern Virginia or on the hill and families got together
[3:53:48.140 --> 3:53:52.860]  for events like all the time and they were Republican families and Democratic families
[3:53:52.860 --> 3:53:59.500]  all together and it's awful hard to look children in the eye and to look families in the eye and
[3:53:59.500 --> 3:54:05.740]  then beat each other up all day so you didn't do that. You treated people with dignity and respect
[3:54:05.740 --> 3:54:11.260]  the respect that if you believe human beings are created in the image and likeness of God that
[3:54:11.260 --> 3:54:18.060]  we're somehow divinely connected to the Creator you would do anyway, right? I mean isn't that the
[3:54:18.060 --> 3:54:23.340]  way we should treat each other as with respect and dignity even when we strongly disagree?
[3:54:24.620 --> 3:54:30.700]  Can't we embrace each other in a way that Christ did where he even embraced prostitutes
[3:54:30.700 --> 3:54:37.500]  and the poor and the dirty and the filthy and the diseased? Can't we look at our adversaries with
[3:54:37.500 --> 3:54:42.940]  same compassion and yet recognition of our differences and be respectful of one another?
[3:54:42.940 --> 3:54:48.060]  I believe we can. In my family we do. There's Republicans and there's Democrats and there's
[3:54:48.060 --> 3:54:54.060]  Libertarians and there's everything in between and everything outside of that and we debate like
[3:54:54.060 --> 3:54:59.740]  crazy on the facts and the merit of the of the debate and we change and we modify and we grow
[3:54:59.740 --> 3:55:07.020]  in that debate and it's vigorous. It's, you know, it's emotional but when we leave we embrace each
[3:55:07.020 --> 3:55:13.820]  other as brothers and sisters and it's a model. It's a model for how the nation should behave.
[3:55:14.620 --> 3:55:20.940]  Debate. Invigorously debate. Don't shut anybody's channel off. You can always change if you don't
[3:55:20.940 --> 3:55:26.380]  like what you're hearing but let's have the debate and let's have it on a platform of facts and ideas
[3:55:26.380 --> 3:55:31.340]  and not be beating each other up, personalizing it. That doesn't take us anywhere and that does not
[3:55:31.340 --> 3:55:36.860]  enlighten the listening public. You that need this information right now so we can take our
[3:55:36.860 --> 3:55:41.740]  government back and gain the command and control of government again because the voting booth is
[3:55:41.740 --> 3:55:49.260]  still working for the moment. For the moment a technocracy does not need electronic voting,
[3:55:49.260 --> 3:55:55.260]  should be opposed, not allowed at all, ever. Under any condition you should be able to pull
[3:55:55.260 --> 3:56:03.820]  that paper ballot with the ink mark on it and count them individually or ever because that's
[3:56:03.820 --> 3:56:11.180]  what's missing is the integrity of the process starting with the voting booth. Kill the technology
[3:56:11.180 --> 3:56:18.380]  on the voting booth. Secondly, kill the money in politics. Corporations are not living souls.
[3:56:18.380 --> 3:56:23.260]  We need a constitutional amendment that says so. That doesn't give them the right to run elections
[3:56:23.260 --> 3:56:29.740]  and attribute enormous sums of money in any way they want to influence political outcomes.
[3:56:29.740 --> 3:56:35.900]  It is not a government for corporations by corporations period. It's about people,
[3:56:36.780 --> 3:56:45.260]  living souls, human beings, us, sovereign human beings and that's what needs to be protected
[3:56:45.260 --> 3:56:50.780]  because that is what is in trying. We need to rethink in the 21st century the concepts of
[3:56:50.780 --> 3:56:57.740]  privacy, liberty and justice and make sure they're applied in this century to living souls,
[3:56:57.740 --> 3:57:05.500]  not dead, lifeless corporations that have nothing but the bottom line at stake, greed at stake,
[3:57:05.500 --> 3:57:12.220]  money at stake because that's their fiduciary, legal responsibility and the only one most of
[3:57:12.220 --> 3:57:17.740]  them have. This is Dr. Nick Begich. This is Infowars. I always forget to mention my website,
