[00:00.000 --> 00:13.760]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex
[00:13.760 --> 00:31.200]  Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones we are going to have wide
[00:31.200 --> 00:39.240]  open phones for the full four hours today on the economy the military adventures that are expanding
[00:39.240 --> 00:47.160]  the door-to-door activities of the Obama Brigades the fact that the House of Representatives last
[00:47.160 --> 00:58.480]  Friday passed a bill to set up a new federal agency to begin national compulsory service
[00:58.480 --> 01:04.880]  including military service known as conscription and the draft of course people been covering this
[01:04.880 --> 01:12.480]  for weeks it is a very close to passing HR 875 it's billed as the end of organic farming no
[01:12.480 --> 01:18.880]  it's not just the end of organic farming because it was tries to restrict people using a cow manure
[01:18.880 --> 01:24.120]  and things which is completely healthy it's the human feces me in Mexico being sprayed on crops
[01:24.120 --> 01:31.360]  that are causing hepatitis and things it basically shuts down family farms ranches even a garden in
[01:31.360 --> 01:39.000]  your own backyard so we'll be talking about that as well today also we've got headlines like these
[01:39.000 --> 01:46.840]  state apologizes to Paul Barr and Baldwin over my ac report the governor last Friday had issued
[01:46.840 --> 01:52.120]  a statement saying he fully stood behind the report but then the civil liberties a complaint has
[01:52.120 --> 01:57.160]  been filed against Governor Jay Nixon for abuse of state law enforcement temporary restraining
[01:57.160 --> 02:03.880]  order sought against Nixon in US District Court and obviously you want to tell the producer get
[02:03.880 --> 02:10.200]  these guys on it's a pro-life group a big pro-life group and the American Civil Liberties Union is
[02:10.200 --> 02:16.720]  involved as well so you have the American Civil Liberties Union filing reports on behalf of pro
[02:16.720 --> 02:24.000]  life groups so little gold star for the ACLU I don't normally do that so that is coming up later
[02:24.000 --> 02:32.040]  in the show I'll cover that also knock a door Obama army a complete failure you know I wouldn't
[02:32.040 --> 02:36.840]  call it a complete failure they got millions of the 13 million they asked to get out on the streets
[02:36.840 --> 02:43.040]  to go out on the streets and knock on doors and singing in ran a disgusting piece basically demonizing
[02:43.040 --> 02:48.160]  people that didn't fall down on their knees and pledged to worship Obama and assign on to an expanded
[02:48.160 --> 02:56.960]  banker takeover so we have that coming up as well in the first hour Geithner plan will rob US
[02:56.960 --> 03:04.360]  taxpayers that's what Joseph Stiklitz is saying Nobel Prize winner for economics he's also a
[03:04.360 --> 03:09.680]  Nobel Prize winner in another field double Nobel Prize winner and let's get Stiklitz back on the
[03:09.680 --> 03:21.400]  show he's been on I think five times so that is just some of what's on our plate there's a big
[03:21.400 --> 03:30.440]  headline today up on drugs from the what the Times of London in fact I thought I printed that at my
[03:30.440 --> 03:34.280]  house guys I don't have that there was a headline on drugs like two hours ago I'm sure it's still
[03:34.280 --> 03:42.840]  there that's that says you know China calls for dumping dollar basically was the headline
[03:42.840 --> 03:48.080]  something's going on with my printer at home it's not printing everything I click on I've got to
[03:48.080 --> 03:52.360]  get a new one I've had the thing like five years you get attached to it though it's a piece of
[03:52.360 --> 04:00.160]  equipment but I I know the thing I my son was a year old when we got that printer so it's time
[04:00.160 --> 04:06.480]  to retire that piece of junk all right oh here it is in fact it wasn't my stack I just hadn't
[04:06.480 --> 04:12.040]  stable it China calls for new reserve currency and then within the article they talk about dumping
[04:12.040 --> 04:20.920]  the dollar so that's a big deal also US seeks expanded power to seize firms not just banks so
[04:20.920 --> 04:28.040]  total takeover of the economy and another headline here is credit markets froze banks loaned millions
[04:28.040 --> 04:36.440]  to insiders all that's coming up to more but on any of the subjects I mentioned or any items you

[08:02.840 --> 08:23.680]  political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network you know near the end of the show yesterday
[08:23.680 --> 08:39.680]  I saw a story out of the associated press where the supreme court today is hearing arguments
[08:39.680 --> 08:46.240]  to basically ban films that criticize the government under election law or any government
[08:46.240 --> 08:52.800]  official and they're calling this election laws and not allowing people to run their
[08:52.800 --> 08:59.000]  films in movie theaters on tv not allow you to air it so they're expanding the fairness
[08:59.000 --> 09:03.600]  doctrine out into anything and everything basically as they have called to do and we've
[09:03.600 --> 09:12.560]  got jay rockefeller the senator from west virginia saying we'd be better off if we never
[09:12.560 --> 09:17.520]  had an internet in congressional testimony calling for restricting the web and you know
[09:17.520 --> 09:22.880]  cuz cyber terrorists are about to attack at any minute and there's 30 million attacks
[09:22.880 --> 09:30.720]  a day on the internet what that means is that there are trojan boxes out there where people
[09:30.720 --> 09:36.080]  go out and put out viruses that program other computers to then do denial of service attacks
[09:36.080 --> 09:42.400]  so yeah and the denial of service attack on one computer system you might have a million
[09:42.400 --> 09:48.720]  requests in a day or more so that's how he puffs it up and says there are 30 million
[09:48.720 --> 09:53.160]  attacks this is deadly this is going to destroy everything meanwhile they've handed over cyber
[09:53.160 --> 09:59.560]  security completely to north com in the pentagon and the head of cyber security two weeks ago
[09:59.560 --> 10:03.920]  resigned saying the military is taking over the internet and basically wants to destroy
[10:03.920 --> 10:08.360]  freedom on the internet and then the real inventor of the internet not al gore but the
[10:08.360 --> 10:14.840]  british lord over there who invented it i heard him on bbc the other day openly admitting
[10:14.840 --> 10:22.480]  they're basically shutting down the web as we know it right now it's happening it's happening
[10:22.480 --> 10:27.480]  right now they are putting it into place just like they're moving to restrict and license
[10:27.480 --> 10:35.880]  and control small farms and small gardens just like they passed a national draft friday
[10:35.880 --> 10:41.520]  in the house of representatives excuse me thursday and still no one seems to know about
[10:41.520 --> 10:46.720]  it though we link directly to the bill that says compulsory national service and this
[10:46.720 --> 10:51.640]  is a new expanded draft not just you know 18 to 24 that's one group for the military
[10:51.640 --> 10:58.800]  and domestically with a new military is large as the current military we have i mean government
[10:58.800 --> 11:04.920]  is just exploding at every level so they're creating all these new agencies new new draft
[11:04.920 --> 11:11.760]  agencies to carry out national conscription new agencies to take over and control the
[11:11.760 --> 11:17.560]  family farms and gardens that's what this new bill does i mean just new agencies are
[11:17.560 --> 11:23.120]  popping up everywhere and it's all about controlling the american people it's all about sucking
[11:23.120 --> 11:30.040]  off of you and taxing you and squeezing you because they're spending around two trillion
[11:30.040 --> 11:40.880]  dollars a month i mean that makes bushes tripling of the size of the government look tame and
[11:40.880 --> 11:46.400]  the private banks are engorging themselves on all of this capital and freezing the flow
[11:46.400 --> 11:53.160]  of assets see the banks had to be paid these trillions to not loan that was their payoff
[11:53.160 --> 12:00.760]  so that they could have the capital replenish that they would lose from not loaning and
[12:00.760 --> 12:05.800]  that's even come out mainstream news that they're hoarding all the cash buying up other
[12:05.800 --> 12:12.000]  companies media defense construction other banks insurance companies brokerage firms
[12:12.000 --> 12:17.960]  when you notice the more power and money they get the worst things get and the more frozen
[12:17.960 --> 12:22.320]  the credit market is and i just saw numbers last week where they've tightened down things
[12:22.320 --> 12:27.640]  even more than they were six months ago on lending for houses and cars and business loans
[12:27.640 --> 12:33.560]  and corporate loans and they say okay give us even more power a new bank of the world
[12:33.560 --> 12:40.560]  you pay your taxes to and then will turn the economy back on so they're holding us hostage
[12:40.560 --> 12:46.600]  it's really that simple i mean the public is mad about a hundred and sixty five million
[12:46.600 --> 12:52.000]  dollars in bonuses to a i g and then they find out that obama actually wrote the executive
[12:52.000 --> 12:56.800]  order for the loopholes for not just that bonus package but hundreds and hundreds of
[12:56.800 --> 13:02.920]  others actually the thousands several thousand bonus packages you know each several thousand
[13:02.920 --> 13:06.840]  packages that were two hundreds and thousands of people depending on the package so it's
[13:06.840 --> 13:12.280]  in the hundreds of thousands of bonuses total or more but there are thousands of of package
[13:12.280 --> 13:18.400]  bundles to be specific but and then dodge up their grandstanding how dare them do this
[13:18.400 --> 13:22.320]  i'm fighting against it for the last two months and it turns out he wrote the provision of
[13:22.320 --> 13:28.480]  the bill of course they did but that is a distraction within itself to the nine point
[13:28.480 --> 13:36.160]  seven trillion and i know i keep saying this but i think it was called right nation i couldn't
[13:36.160 --> 13:48.600]  write notes i was watching hbo this morning for an hour on the treadmill and i saw a large
[13:48.600 --> 13:53.640]  part of this documentary it said it was produced by nancy polosi's daughter because i recognized
[13:53.640 --> 14:01.560]  her name she's made puff pieces for george bush as well she specializes in pure propaganda
[14:01.560 --> 14:06.880]  and they only showed people in louisiana in mississippi calling obama the n word during
[14:06.880 --> 14:12.000]  the campaign saying he was a muslim a communist that he was really a soma bin laden he was
[14:12.000 --> 14:18.920]  in a polar rubber mask off now i can go find democrat clowns just as crazy just as insane
[14:18.920 --> 14:23.480]  kind of nut jobs that get attracted to political rallies they're always there and then we put
[14:23.480 --> 14:29.920]  some of those actually in terror storm saying that wmds were really found in iraq and one
[14:29.920 --> 14:34.600]  guy goes nanny nanny boo boo stick your head and do i mean literally these are mentally
[14:34.600 --> 14:40.720]  ill people he literally put his thumb to his nose and went nanny nanny boo boo to me in
[14:40.720 --> 14:48.880]  terror storm so well the technical rob had the camera rob jackson so we know those people
[14:48.880 --> 14:56.200]  are real but the message is you see they're gonna put out mindless toothless idiotic opposition
[14:56.200 --> 15:01.720]  to obama they're gonna have limbaugh thoroughly discredited looking like he was drugged out
[15:01.720 --> 15:09.680]  of his mind again when he was up on stage at the conservative pack meeting and and and
[15:09.680 --> 15:13.840]  this has come out in white house memos i told you this before obama was even elected and
[15:13.840 --> 15:20.280]  then when he was the era parent when he was uh... president elect i said you watch they're
[15:20.280 --> 15:25.200]  gonna set limbaugh up against him they're gonna set toothless ne'er do wells up against
[15:25.200 --> 15:31.720]  him fake conservatives and then that will be what buoys support of the democrats who
[15:31.720 --> 15:37.080]  were anti-war and anti-patriot act and anti-police state to go ahead and not just sign on the
[15:37.080 --> 15:43.320]  dotted line and go along with obama's betrayal of all of his promises but to fervently do
[15:43.320 --> 15:48.480]  it because they see him as the only option against rush limbaugh stumbling around on
[15:48.480 --> 15:57.160]  drugs and a bunch of people saying i'm never gonna vote for that inward over and over and
[15:57.160 --> 16:03.920]  over again in nancy polosi's daughters out putting this out guys go to i am db for me
[16:03.920 --> 16:10.800]  and other film site and pull up google nancy polosi his daughter films and and and i think
[16:10.800 --> 16:16.760]  it's right nation is what it's called but uh... i recognize her name i'm gonna double
[16:16.760 --> 16:19.800]  check and make sure that sir is there may be one with the same name as nancy polosi's
[16:19.800 --> 16:27.800]  daughter who made this but i i saw most of it this morning and that's why people go
[16:27.800 --> 16:36.360]  on the youtube channel where we have the obama deception posted for free and they won't watch
[16:36.360 --> 16:44.640]  the film they just say you republicans lost get over it you racist because then i had
[16:44.640 --> 16:49.680]  the end of my workout i flipped down a few channels on hb o there was another film about
[16:49.680 --> 16:57.420]  the election showing racist not liking obama and i mean this is a full court press everywhere
[16:57.420 --> 17:03.680]  and so it doesn't matter if jim jones james jones the head of the national security council
[17:03.680 --> 17:08.760]  openly says on the cfr website that he takes orders from henry kissinger who nixon took
[17:08.760 --> 17:18.840]  orders from and who through brazil ski we had uh... carter taking orders from and bush
[17:18.840 --> 17:25.000]  senior reagan george w bush the vatican the queen of england this is the roth child legged
[17:25.000 --> 17:34.640]  he's the he's he's the frontman and so it doesn't matter if he increases the troops in afghanistan
[17:34.640 --> 17:38.200]  and now says he's gonna keep the troops in iraq it doesn't matter if he says that the
[17:38.200 --> 17:41.640]  detainees don't have any rights are going to keep him in torture camps it doesn't matter
[17:41.640 --> 17:49.920]  of all he appoints his lobbyist they don't care because because it's this mind game this
[17:49.920 --> 17:56.280]  this middle scam that's run that's very simple but works on the simple minded that they get
[17:56.280 --> 18:01.600]  them to raw raw get in a campaign support obama in the fight against mccain then their egos
[18:01.600 --> 18:06.640]  are buoyed they feel like they want a big victory through obama he's now in and then
[18:06.640 --> 18:11.720]  meanwhile limbaugh stumbling around acting like a drug gorilla only way to describe
[18:11.720 --> 18:15.760]  him looking completely psychopathic it used to look like that a decade ago the guys just
[18:15.760 --> 18:22.080]  fried i predict he's gonna have a collapse soon or something i mean he admits he took
[18:22.080 --> 18:27.280]  a hundred oxy cottons a day folks that would kill seven horses of average weight and that's
[18:27.280 --> 18:34.120]  how big his liver is that's how much hillbilly heroin this boy takes but side issue you see
[18:34.120 --> 18:39.000]  obama can't run and he admits it's a perpetual campaign his new order agenda on what he's
[18:39.000 --> 18:45.040]  done and and who he works for he has to run on he's this anti-establishment guy fighting
[18:45.040 --> 18:51.800]  the vast right wing conspiracy of mr. oxy cotton and a bunch of poor ignorant hillbillies
[18:51.800 --> 18:56.920]  that following that's what they're running on that's who they are that's that's what
[18:56.920 --> 19:03.320]  they're doing but even that is wearing thin is a purple ratings in most polls is dropped
[19:03.320 --> 19:16.120]  between 15 and 22 percent but um i was just amazed to see that film this morning meanwhile
[19:16.120 --> 19:24.280]  obama is launching the total banker takeover complete seamless integration from bush to
[19:24.280 --> 19:29.520]  him the same people running the whole show geithner involved in writing the original
[19:29.520 --> 19:35.680]  banker takeover bill that's mainstream news i mean that's what the public has to get this
[19:35.680 --> 19:43.680]  is a show this is theater like shakespeare and you got bush and limbaugh and obama running
[19:43.680 --> 19:49.040]  around they're all in the same team like carville and mary madeline are married or you got you
[19:49.040 --> 19:53.600]  know just all these families where they split up who covers what side of the spectrum it's

[24:46.280 --> 24:50.360]  obama deception was a great film it wasn't as hard-hitting but it definitely got the point
[24:50.360 --> 24:57.880]  across but listen the obama deception is meant to reach out to people who aren't awake about the
[24:57.880 --> 25:02.920]  bankers being the real government and the new world order and that's why in the first five
[25:02.920 --> 25:07.640]  minutes we show that bush is bad and so is obama and we show how they work for the same people
[25:07.640 --> 25:11.240]  you know i've gotten emails from a few folks saying well alex you know we you talk about
[25:11.240 --> 25:17.480]  all this on your show you know what you know what's new here it's made to wake up the masses
[25:17.480 --> 25:23.880]  that aren't awake go ahead right i totally agree but uh i just want to touch base um i'm actually
[25:23.880 --> 25:29.880]  from uh texas i live in arlington area and uh i frequently see a lot of homeland security
[25:29.880 --> 25:35.160]  and federal police trucks all over the place uh i once knew a girl her car started on fire and
[25:35.160 --> 25:39.560]  the first person there was a homeland security and it just really seems like you know they're
[25:39.560 --> 25:45.400]  really getting us used to uh seeing all that yeah federal well i was talking to jim mars
[25:45.400 --> 25:49.800]  when he was in studio friday and he talked about in the 60s and 70s when he was the main crime
[25:49.800 --> 25:56.360]  reporter for the fortwork star telegram uh in a car and you know he drove around uh with a recorder
[25:56.360 --> 26:00.680]  he drove around with a pad and paper went to all the crime scenes and the feds would show up with
[26:00.680 --> 26:05.640]  hat in hand saying do you mind maybe if i could be involved in this investigation i know it's not
[26:05.640 --> 26:13.240]  my jurisdiction to even by the 70s when he quit doing that went to be a professor and an author
[26:13.240 --> 26:16.840]  that they would just say i'm the fbi i'm taking over this operation see
[26:17.720 --> 26:22.440]  it's a total violation of the tenth amendment they're federalizing everything i read a mainstream
[26:22.440 --> 26:29.160]  news article yesterday where homeland security is going to people's homes that buy a thousand rounds
[26:29.160 --> 26:34.280]  of ammunition to ask them if they're terrorist what is homeland security security doing involved
[26:34.280 --> 26:40.040]  in that well they took over every federal agency it is a federal police force everything is happening
[26:40.040 --> 26:45.880]  go ahead yeah i believe they did that in prohibition too but um uh my friend as in the military he's
[26:45.880 --> 26:52.440]  in communications uh in army and he's stationed in fort hawashow in southern arizona and uh
[26:52.440 --> 26:55.400]  i was telling him about the whole border thing down there and he didn't really believe me and
[26:55.400 --> 27:00.440]  then i believe rick perry asked obama for a bunch of troops and a couple days went by i talked to
[27:00.440 --> 27:05.240]  my friend again he said he's they're shipping him to el pass so in full battle rattle so i don't
[27:05.240 --> 27:09.560]  know what's going on with that but you know it's just kind of seems like martial law we've had the
[27:09.560 --> 27:14.200]  state senator on the show has been already basically set up on the border it's a secret
[27:14.200 --> 27:19.320]  threat calm that means it's martial law and he basically said that on air and uh it's been in
[27:19.320 --> 27:23.800]  the associated press but people didn't believe us the week before it was announced when we told
[27:23.800 --> 27:31.640]  folks first year yeah my dad also works for for gm to touch on a lot of that um before gm even
[27:31.640 --> 27:37.720]  discussed about uh bankruptcy they released these flyers around all the second shift people
[27:37.720 --> 27:40.840]  and they were talking about how they're going to cut this and how they're going to cut that and as
[27:40.840 --> 27:45.640]  soon as uh they said or soon as before they said they were going to get bankrupt they took all these
[27:45.640 --> 27:49.800]  flyers back but my dad kept them and i saved them all and they just said all these things are going
[27:49.800 --> 27:55.320]  to cut and it just seems like they're going to keep gm alive until they're finally done stealing
[27:55.320 --> 27:58.840]  all the money and as soon as they're done stealing all the money it seems like they're just going
[27:58.840 --> 28:03.560]  to destroy every image of america be it industry or industry is all at once you know yes well that
[28:03.560 --> 28:07.080]  was a month ago it was actually in the news that gm was going to declare bankruptcy
[28:07.080 --> 28:12.200]  bankruptcy and then two days later they said okay we're not going to do it for now so the flyer you
[28:12.200 --> 28:18.280]  saw was real i appreciate your call good to hear from you don and michigan jesse in los vegas
[28:18.280 --> 28:25.000]  you're on the air jesse how are you alex good good good um you know i i wanted to first start with
[28:25.000 --> 28:30.200]  the obama deception uh definitely enjoyed it uh yeah because i listened to you so much i can't
[28:30.200 --> 28:34.920]  say that i learned too much but the exciting part is that i get to meet people and bring up the
[28:34.920 --> 28:39.240]  obama deception and these are the mit romney types that were out here in uh... los vegas and nevada
[28:39.240 --> 28:44.120]  which you know that was a huge movement out here um and they already know about the film
[28:44.120 --> 28:48.680]  or someone has told them and is preparing to send it to them i mean it's it's literally like giving
[28:48.680 --> 28:52.680]  water to thirsty people it's very good to remember well i'm gonna hold you over but
[28:52.680 --> 28:56.760]  i mean this is a key comment i don't really talk much about the film specifically since it came out
[28:57.560 --> 29:02.360]  you know other than the fact that we need to get it out to people the film with their own quotes
[29:02.360 --> 29:08.600]  their own documents their own executive orders shows that they work for the very same group
[29:08.600 --> 29:14.360]  and it shatters the left right paradigm and in the film we show how they put a loophole in
[29:14.360 --> 29:20.200]  for all of the major banks and brokerage firms to be able to give the bailout money to themselves
[29:20.200 --> 29:26.440]  as bonuses now again that just broke last week perfect timing when the film came out
[29:26.440 --> 29:31.800]  because we just went to the executive order in reddit so the film i'm going to give folks a brief
[29:31.800 --> 29:35.960]  synopsis on air of what the film covers and why it's so important we'll go right back to you jesse

[33:14.280 --> 33:21.800]  all right let me try to explain why i made the obama deception
[33:23.560 --> 33:28.440]  because i knew that all of the attacks from here on out and the way the mainstream media is going
[33:28.440 --> 33:36.520]  to frame things is that it's basically toothless mindless backwards kind of mainline republicans
[33:36.520 --> 33:42.840]  who believe that he secretly Osama bin Laden with a rubber mask on uh you know that he was born in
[33:42.840 --> 33:49.240]  Kenya and all of this whether whether the born in kenyan thing is true or not the media early on
[33:49.240 --> 33:57.400]  shows to make that the big issue meanwhile if you look at the polls 98 percent of americans
[33:59.240 --> 34:02.440]  congress reported thousand to one phone calls that's more than 98 percent
[34:03.240 --> 34:09.080]  against the banker takeover republican democrat libertarian black white chinese
[34:09.080 --> 34:13.800]  mexican it doesn't matter people know it's a scam and they only know a little bit of the
[34:13.800 --> 34:17.080]  story they only know a little bit of how bad the robbery and the fraud is
[34:19.080 --> 34:23.720]  and so instead of attacking obama on things that actually make him stronger it only makes him
[34:23.720 --> 34:29.640]  stronger to have the discredited bushites that everybody know are a pack of criminal liars
[34:29.640 --> 34:39.080]  lies about wmd's torture secret arrest all the arrogance all the secrecy that is discredited and
[34:39.080 --> 34:43.080]  we did a lot of that discrediting here on air but always pointing out that bush was still a front
[34:43.080 --> 34:47.240]  man they'd bring a new puppet in and the film explains that they'll get rid of obama in four
[34:47.240 --> 34:52.200]  to eight years and bring in a new puppet and suddenly all these republicans that were anti
[34:52.200 --> 34:56.840]  establishment anti-corruption they'll suddenly love it because they will associate their personal
[34:56.840 --> 35:01.800]  power and their identity with the new republican leader just like democrats who were anti-war
[35:01.800 --> 35:06.840]  and anti lobbyist and anti-banker they're suddenly all for it because they see it as
[35:06.840 --> 35:11.720]  their man's doing it they won that's the emails i get by the hundreds and the comments on info
[35:11.720 --> 35:16.440]  wars and present planet and the comments on the youtube pages that have the film posted it's
[35:17.400 --> 35:22.840]  you know every 10 comments i'd say 90 percent's positive but every 10th comment on average is like
[35:22.840 --> 35:32.120]  you sick republicans you lost get used to it racist they just don't understand but a lot of them are
[35:32.120 --> 35:37.720]  actually watching it and going whoa a bomb just went off in my head whoa yeah this is alex jones
[35:37.720 --> 35:43.160]  who exposed bush man obama's betrayed us we got to go after the federal reserve we got to stop
[35:43.160 --> 35:48.760]  looking at the ponds and start looking at the the back line there you know the leaders of this thing
[35:48.760 --> 35:53.000]  on the chess set the rooks and the knights and the king and the queen and the bishops
[35:54.760 --> 36:00.280]  and so that's what the film does it shows you who really runs things how they control both parties
[36:00.280 --> 36:05.640]  how they're bankrupting the country and the world to bring in a world government oven by the banks
[36:09.000 --> 36:15.000]  and so as listeners of this show and as patriots who are awake to the left-right paradigm in the
[36:15.000 --> 36:21.800]  new world order and world government yes the obama deception slickly packages with all the clips
[36:21.800 --> 36:26.280]  and obama saying one thing and then changing it later saying one thing and doing another
[36:26.280 --> 36:30.680]  and obama working with the republicans to bring in the banker takeover and how he was instrumental
[36:30.680 --> 36:38.440]  in getting it done and how what his real policies are of national youth corps a new draft restricting
[36:38.440 --> 36:48.040]  farms and ranches animal id premises id lobbyist it's all there and so this is something that where
[36:48.040 --> 36:57.160]  you can take all these complex issues and you can give them a 112 minute film just shy of two hours
[36:57.800 --> 37:03.320]  and it's well produced and they will watch it and many of them the majority of the obama
[37:03.320 --> 37:10.120]  noise will wake up but just as important conservatives because they're anti-obama but
[37:10.120 --> 37:15.880]  for the wrong reasons in most cases kind of the false you know right side of the paradigm
[37:15.880 --> 37:21.480]  the limited conservatism the control conservatism they'll go ahead and watch it and so what's
[37:21.480 --> 37:27.240]  happening is we're getting just as many mainline george bush rush limbaugh john mccain republicans
[37:27.240 --> 37:31.800]  are saying oh my gosh there is a world government i checked all these mainstream news articles and
[37:31.800 --> 37:36.680]  video clips in the film and they really are bankrupting things by design to bring in a
[37:36.680 --> 37:43.320]  world government so it wakes up the phony right wingers it wakes up the phony left wingers and
[37:43.320 --> 37:52.040]  then they start investigating the new world order the wake up has begun and they're on the path towards
[37:52.040 --> 37:57.000]  moving for liberty not being oh i vote republican or i vote democrat then both parties are controlled
[37:57.000 --> 38:06.840]  now it's a discussion of liberty versus tyranny now it's a discussion of do i want freedom or do
[38:06.840 --> 38:11.160]  i want government control and then the most important thing the film does is it shows that
[38:11.160 --> 38:19.240]  obama has been billed he has been cast he has been pushed he has been set up as an anti-establishment
[38:19.240 --> 38:24.760]  guy and you watch his weekly address video and radio address he does i mean every saturday it goes
[38:24.760 --> 38:28.760]  out at whitehouse.gov you can go watch it he's always saying i'm fighting the establishment
[38:28.760 --> 38:32.840]  i'm fighting special interests and i need the american people to help me i need you to get
[38:32.840 --> 38:39.000]  behind me because the establishment desperately needs boots on the ground the establishment
[38:39.000 --> 38:45.000]  desperately needs their own private army to create the illusion that this is what the people want
[38:45.000 --> 38:50.440]  and so as the american people protest and demonstrate and take to the streets and take over the media
[38:50.440 --> 38:56.040]  coverage and begin exposing obama which is already happening the true anti-war movement and others
[38:57.000 --> 39:03.720]  they need to be able to sick their obama supporters on them with the obama zombies believing
[39:03.720 --> 39:08.120]  that they're fighting people that are stopping obama's agenda of saving us
[39:11.240 --> 39:13.880]  and i have a CNN clip we didn't get to yesterday
[39:14.520 --> 39:18.520]  but after i take some calls i'm gonna play it in the next hour and they keep referring to it as
[39:18.520 --> 39:24.200]  obama's army obama's ground troops obama's ground force how this has never before been done in u.s
[39:24.200 --> 39:30.600]  politics and that's true it's been done in china russia germany cambodia cuba venezuela and every
[39:30.600 --> 39:38.440]  other place it's under tyranny it is textbook tyranny textbook classic communism or fascism
[39:39.000 --> 39:43.480]  which again in the false left right paradigm or two ends of the spectrum know that they're together
[39:43.480 --> 39:48.200]  it's command and control always labeling itself different ways and then fooling people through
[39:48.200 --> 39:51.960]  that false choice what form of command and control do you want i don't know they all
[39:51.960 --> 39:55.640]  wear black uniforms they've all got secret police they all go out of the second amendment
[39:55.640 --> 39:59.880]  they all expand the size of government and hand the money to offshore banks i don't want either one
[39:59.880 --> 40:05.640]  of them now you can debate all day what obama's setting up is it hardcore socialism or fascism
[40:05.640 --> 40:10.440]  and within the false left right paradigm it is fascism i mean if you want to judge it according
[40:10.440 --> 40:16.600]  to that yardstick it is fascism you know newsweek has the headline we're all socialists now no we're
[40:16.600 --> 40:23.320]  not 9.7 trillion to offshore banks of your money that you've got to pay meanwhile they tell the
[40:23.320 --> 40:27.880]  dumbed-down masses of people that think socialism's good oh you're really sucking it to the rich
[40:27.880 --> 40:32.680]  guys you're getting some goodies right now no you're not getting any goodies you're being
[40:32.680 --> 40:39.880]  domesticated institutionalized enslaved out of the 9.7 trillion that's been served out
[40:39.880 --> 40:46.520]  only 200 billion of it has been given to the people and that with federalized strings attached
[40:46.520 --> 40:50.840]  okay so i'm gonna go back to the caller because i was cutting him off as i always do because
[40:50.840 --> 40:54.360]  so many thoughts go through my mind he's saying he talked all these mainline conservatives and
[40:54.360 --> 40:58.680]  they've already heard of the obama deception see that's the good news this thing is going super
[40:58.680 --> 41:03.880]  viral there are hundreds and hundreds of versions of it on every major video service out there
[41:03.880 --> 41:13.480]  there and it'll be 500,000 views 600,000 views 900,000 views 100,000 views 50,000 views 80,000

[43:23.000 --> 43:26.920]  just migrating thousands of pieces of media over but that's almost done all right i'm done
[43:26.920 --> 43:31.160]  running about that now i'm gonna try to shut up and let the callers talk uh who was i talking to
[43:31.160 --> 43:35.000]  jesse in los vegas okay you got the floor tell me what's happening with the obama deception
[43:36.440 --> 43:41.160]  well ultimately my uh well first of all the graphics on it the sound the production amazing
[43:41.160 --> 43:45.240]  thank you very much for being such a professional and uh honing your craft but the the reason why
[43:45.240 --> 43:49.480]  i was calling today actually had more to do with marshal law here in los vegas nevada
[43:50.760 --> 43:54.440]  just to start with the little hearsay my wife was at one of the nice parks here in henderson
[43:54.440 --> 43:59.240]  and a mother was there and it said gee my car was broken into into broad daylight and the
[43:59.240 --> 44:03.560]  the henderson police had come out and said uh yeah this has happened a lot at this park
[44:03.560 --> 44:08.120]  and by the way crime's so bad on the east side they're looking at calling out the military
[44:08.120 --> 44:12.120]  of course that that set off my little alarm bells i um happened to have some relatives
[44:12.120 --> 44:16.440]  at work for the forest and i called him up one happens to be directly over the side on the
[44:16.440 --> 44:22.680]  graveyard and i put it to a point blank what's going on i mean have you heard this and you know
[44:23.480 --> 44:27.880]  he's kind of a normal guy so i'm trying to you know walk walk lightly so that i can get more
[44:27.880 --> 44:31.880]  and more information and he says yeah there's some bad mojo well please explain what the bad mojo
[44:31.880 --> 44:37.400]  is he says well you know they're they're taking over coastal towns and border towns uh because
[44:37.400 --> 44:43.000]  and i'm like well because of the the drugs right no no it's more like these uh these officers down
[44:43.000 --> 44:47.560]  there on the coast are are wanting to side with the citizens instead of the government i'm like
[44:47.560 --> 44:53.400]  do you mean that these cops are corrupt are they in on the smuggling no they're going to listen to
[44:53.400 --> 44:57.400]  the local citizenry over the what the federal government wants them to do so the military
[44:57.400 --> 45:02.200]  has taken them over and now you know they're considering coming into las vegas because of
[45:02.200 --> 45:09.000]  some bad mojo i'm like hold on a minute this isn't about crime and and i mean that's pretty much
[45:09.000 --> 45:13.080]  where we left it but i mean this goes right in the line with what's going on in new york this
[45:13.080 --> 45:17.080]  goes right on the line with the other rumors that you're hearing but why are poor so that was not
[45:17.080 --> 45:21.480]  a rumor told this so let me tell you exactly what's going on well obviously you know what's
[45:21.480 --> 45:29.000]  going on the john warner defense authorization act pdd 51 the six months ago when secretary
[45:29.000 --> 45:34.040]  defense gates announced the restructuring of the national guard under federal control
[45:35.480 --> 45:43.560]  its states in that memorandum that they are preparing for physical conflict with the american
[45:43.560 --> 45:49.160]  people and the local legislatures to take over the states and that even the federal congress
[45:49.960 --> 45:52.520]  which is co-equal with the president and the judicial
[45:52.520 --> 45:58.920]  will be going under their control so the army war college the public pentagon directives
[46:00.440 --> 46:08.680]  all of it is publicly drawing publicly this is not rumor battle lines with the cities with
[46:08.680 --> 46:14.040]  the counties with the states that's what delta force and the fbi and cia have been doing for at
[46:14.040 --> 46:20.200]  least uh 15 years that i know of is identifying cities counties trying to get most sheriffs to
[46:20.200 --> 46:26.600]  be retired fbi or dea or former special ops getting their people in place taking america
[46:26.600 --> 46:31.560]  down didn't like taking down some third world country the cia can do that in a weekend it's
[46:31.560 --> 46:40.600]  taking them decades so this is the slow calculated takeover now it's not a rumor that in uh that
[46:40.600 --> 46:49.560]  big town up in new york that we read the headline from schenectady it is not our opinion that was
[46:49.560 --> 46:56.360]  in the albany tv news stations and the newspaper we even had the mayor contact us and admit his
[46:56.360 --> 47:02.040]  statement is up on prisonplanet.com he contacted us friday and he said yeah well what's wrong
[47:02.040 --> 47:09.480]  with marshal law we need the army here to take care of five bad cops out of 166 on the force see
[47:09.480 --> 47:16.680]  and that's a mayor on the list of the first beta test of 45 mayors to go under federal control so
[47:16.680 --> 47:20.760]  see they've they've been setting up marshal law they've been setting up the takeover they know the
[47:20.760 --> 47:25.320]  public's gonna riot when they take the pension funds in the 401ks even from the state workers
[47:26.200 --> 47:33.480]  so this is they need marshal law to carry out the full banking heist like they did in iceland
[47:33.480 --> 47:38.040]  or in argentina and the imf world bank documents came out in argentina and they said they wanted
[47:38.040 --> 47:44.040]  to do it here next that's why i've been screaming since 2002 when the bbc broke that and i had greg
[47:44.040 --> 47:51.160]  palestin for even more uh their news night reporters so this is look when i get up here and i say
[47:51.160 --> 47:56.040]  they're planning to go red they're planning to go hot when i you know when i read the john
[47:56.040 --> 48:01.880]  warner defense authorization act it says for insurrection in the states and so what's happening
[48:01.880 --> 48:09.960]  is you know i said four years ago with uh silica still on air i said they're going to collapse
[48:09.960 --> 48:15.880]  mexico by expanding the drug war against the cartels they don't control they're going to use that
[48:15.880 --> 48:21.880]  to have marshal law on the border states as the beta test they're going to have an economic collapse
[48:21.880 --> 48:26.840]  all over the country and then it'll be precedent setting oh the army's here to help at car racks
[48:26.840 --> 48:32.520]  the army's here to help at shootings the army's here to help at dw i checkpoints the army's here
[48:32.520 --> 48:37.640]  to help with the illegals the oh my gosh there's so much so many crimes and robberies we've got to
[48:37.640 --> 48:42.520]  have gun control which they've now announced oh my gosh the mexican mafias killing so many people
[48:42.520 --> 48:48.360]  and so many cops we've got to restrict the second amendment they have to bring in chaos order out of
[48:48.360 --> 48:55.400]  chaos to do this and yes through the fusion centers they have all sir i read last week
[48:55.400 --> 48:59.800]  a bunch of mainstream articles where they're putting regular army in every major police
[48:59.800 --> 49:05.880]  department as liaison officers to to spy on the people they have the army spying on us at the
[49:05.880 --> 49:12.440]  in the fed in dallas mainstream you know news with mainstream documents this is happening so
[49:13.160 --> 49:18.840]  understand they have to sell marshal law they can't just one day when it's you know five years ago a
[49:18.840 --> 49:23.560]  good economy suddenly have troops all over the streets they have to have a mega massive terror
[49:23.560 --> 49:27.560]  attack is one way of doing it but they use that to get in place they'll probably have another one
[49:27.560 --> 49:31.560]  soon i see that in the cards they can't get away with us without one without several big ones by
[49:31.560 --> 49:37.160]  the way so i'm saying that's going to happen soon unless we get the word out without total
[49:37.160 --> 49:43.560]  economic collapse and maybe even ace in the hole a bird flu or sars or something like that
[49:43.560 --> 49:50.200]  out of nowhere so i understand the enemy and and this they want to do what they did in the
[49:50.200 --> 49:54.200]  soviet union and in germany the globalists funded both of those that's now declassified
[49:54.200 --> 50:01.160]  they plan on a hot revolution where everything blows to hell the look all of the elites in
[50:01.160 --> 50:06.200]  the last four years and a lot of them live in austin austin's the richest city per capita in the
[50:06.200 --> 50:12.600]  country more than manhattan more than san francisco now they've all left okay they have left to the
[50:12.600 --> 50:19.640]  cook islands they have left to the bahamas they have armored uh... hired security details with
[50:19.640 --> 50:26.040]  automatic weapons guarding them understand they're going to sit offshore while they fully implode
[50:26.040 --> 50:32.280]  us to understand i do understand and let me rephrase uh... i mean rumors in terms of these

[54:53.160 --> 54:57.640]  it's happening all right let's go back briefly to jesse know that wilson and everybody else
[54:57.640 --> 55:03.560]  so go ahead jesse ultimately i appreciate the time but i'm just saying local patrol officers
[55:03.560 --> 55:07.800]  are getting this fed to them for a reason but it's not in the reports it's not in the it's not in
[55:07.800 --> 55:11.960]  the forefront of any of the local people here in the other area that they've got to go under military
[55:11.960 --> 55:17.720]  control so i know you guys are busy there so i need my people in las vegas that are in the
[55:17.720 --> 55:21.880]  old ron paul meetup in the 911 truth meetups that uh... that we're all a part of uh... to
[55:21.880 --> 55:25.800]  unify here and at least take it to the mayor at least take it to the local police at least get it
[55:25.800 --> 55:30.280]  to some reporter who may put it in the newspaper because it's happening here now and this is a
[55:30.280 --> 55:36.840]  libertarian state supposedly oh it's in mainstream news that the feds are encouraging cities for any
[55:36.840 --> 55:42.120]  petty problems to bring in federal troops you see they want it with a whimper not a bang
[55:42.840 --> 55:48.200]  you understand this is creeping death they've got to get the police ready first before they tell
[55:48.200 --> 55:53.080]  the public but all the government bills and documents state they're doing this
[55:55.000 --> 56:00.520]  but we here's the good news here's the good news they need at least the illusion of public support
[56:01.080 --> 56:06.760]  that's why obama is meant to be a messianic leader to get all of these mindless idiots behind
[56:06.760 --> 56:11.560]  him to try to sucker the public but i'm telling you it's not working that now in closing you
[56:11.560 --> 56:15.000]  mentioned that you're telling everybody about the obama deception and they've already heard about
[56:15.000 --> 56:19.880]  it so that's good news yeah absolutely just even a little secretary at one of our remote
[56:19.880 --> 56:25.240]  offices that we go to i uh... you know just took a stab hey do you like obama no she says
[56:25.240 --> 56:29.080]  i said well i was surprised but i said well i have this great new movie called the obama
[56:29.080 --> 56:34.280]  deception i've already heard it i'm like really yeah i'm on mit romney friends are really into
[56:34.280 --> 56:38.840]  that because they hate obama so much and they have this new film and i haven't seen it yet but
[56:39.400 --> 56:45.080]  see so i mean see but hold on we'll use their false right wing hatred of him to actually
[56:45.080 --> 56:50.520]  inject the truth and wake them up and the liberals see how that works absolutely and i'm grateful for
[56:50.520 --> 56:55.640]  it hey thank you sir good to hear from you i hope folks will get involved there in las vegas yes
[56:55.640 --> 57:00.120]  uh... this is going on all over the country all the marines are just here at a checkpoint to help
[57:00.120 --> 57:05.560]  oh we may have martial law in the city in that nice all crimes up all they're building
[57:05.560 --> 57:10.280]  emergency fema centers with free medical care for the collapse of the tent cities
[57:10.280 --> 57:14.760]  you can come live in a camp now then they advertise the camps set the precedent that you know with
[57:14.760 --> 57:19.000]  the news getting tours of them and well we do have security we do lock you in at night just
[57:19.000 --> 57:23.320]  like the fema trailers in new orleans and around there you know for your safety you're not allowed

[59:47.720 --> 1:00:07.160]  storeable food waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio network big brother mainstream
[1:00:07.160 --> 1:00:17.320]  media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the gcm radio network
[1:00:17.320 --> 1:00:26.040]  and now live from austin texas alex jones you know a lot of what obama is doing they're openly
[1:00:26.040 --> 1:00:32.040]  announcing but quite a bit of it they're not i mean they passed last thursday a national draft
[1:00:32.040 --> 1:00:38.440]  bill that is for women as well the feds force middle school students to work for the federal
[1:00:38.440 --> 1:00:45.720]  government and basically brainwashing seminars high schoolers 18 to 24 for military and domestic
[1:00:45.720 --> 1:00:50.440]  a new domestic military conscription paul watson is doing another big article on that that ties
[1:00:50.440 --> 1:00:55.080]  into the pentagons directive they put out three weeks ago for the new one million person civilian
[1:00:55.080 --> 1:01:01.160]  military force it says in there it'll be forced military service it's just in a support role
[1:01:01.160 --> 1:01:08.040]  not combat role you'll still get blown to bits or have a good chance of it i mean this is unbelievable
[1:01:08.040 --> 1:01:14.360]  and no one is talking about it literally you don't hear the aclu you don't hear the liberals
[1:01:14.360 --> 1:01:20.440]  you don't hear the huffington post because it's obama now can you imagine if bush tried this
[1:01:20.440 --> 1:01:24.920]  here's another example bush was spending on average nine billion dollars a year's one year it
[1:01:24.920 --> 1:01:28.440]  was six billion then nine billion then twelve billion but it was around you know nine billion
[1:01:28.440 --> 1:01:35.080]  bucks obama is talking about 20 billion bucks out of the stimulus package and that's what it's
[1:01:35.080 --> 1:01:41.240]  written up for just for acorn alone another 20 billion dollars to pay off the churches he had
[1:01:41.240 --> 1:01:45.720]  a big meeting with thousands of preachers at the white house and he was there enrolling them to
[1:01:45.720 --> 1:01:50.200]  quote work in their community and basically spy on their neighbors it said watch your community
[1:01:50.200 --> 1:01:54.360]  be you know run your neighborhood knock on doors now they're openly doing it
[1:01:55.720 --> 1:02:01.320]  and it's faith-based initiative i remember all those reporters you know bush how dare you separation
[1:02:01.320 --> 1:02:06.040]  church estate this is fascism when a government takes over religion and it is or communism it's
[1:02:06.040 --> 1:02:12.280]  command and control pick your poison you can call it whatever you want it's tyranny and
[1:02:13.720 --> 1:02:18.280]  now they're they love the faith-based initiative see i mean it's just bush could have never gotten
[1:02:18.280 --> 1:02:24.440]  away with this that's why they're making him a messianic leader going back to uh wilson in new
[1:02:24.440 --> 1:02:29.480]  york talking to wilson right wilson to go ahead and finish up your point you're saying the obama
[1:02:29.480 --> 1:02:36.040]  deception is waking up obama zombies yes it is it definitely took any doubt from them like sometimes
[1:02:36.040 --> 1:02:41.320]  they'll say well maybe you know he he will do something good that he now that he has the power
[1:02:41.320 --> 1:02:47.480]  but the film definitely just takes out it just proves to them completely because it gives so
[1:02:47.480 --> 1:02:52.600]  much information in fact so that i just want to say thank you for just making all the information
[1:02:52.600 --> 1:02:57.080]  so interesting well thank you describing more detail the folks you've showed it to and what
[1:02:57.080 --> 1:03:02.040]  they're saying when they see it well i've my mother is a teacher and i've showed it to my mother
[1:03:02.040 --> 1:03:06.760]  and then i gave her copies to give to the teachers i have friends and some of them are just like
[1:03:06.760 --> 1:03:12.600]  baffle that the information that it brings like the million youth brigade brigade kind of thing like
[1:03:13.240 --> 1:03:19.160]  that was hard for me to explain but the but the film it just puts it like so simple and so
[1:03:19.160 --> 1:03:26.040]  so easy to understand so that was just great and i just wanted to say one thing if it's possible
[1:03:26.040 --> 1:03:31.560]  you should try to make like a link that will make info wars like the home page so like right when
[1:03:31.560 --> 1:03:36.360]  you go on the internet it's possible that like that's the first page that comes up so i could
[1:03:36.360 --> 1:03:42.760]  possibly like do that in certain computers to make that the main page that comes up right when
[1:03:43.320 --> 1:03:47.720]  like you go on the internet well you know we get so busy just trying to finish your film and get
[1:03:47.720 --> 1:03:54.920]  it out that we don't think all this through um but i want everybody to put it all over the web
[1:03:54.920 --> 1:03:59.320]  and then everybody rushed to upload it so they uploaded really low quality copies
[1:03:59.320 --> 1:04:05.880]  a guy with the handle of change the channel at youtube did the most beautiful and it's in one
[1:04:05.880 --> 1:04:11.960]  piece he's got a director's account it was the most beautiful one piece upload i've ever seen
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:18.840]  very high quality for youtube and we're trying to link to that one i would ask him to you know
[1:04:18.840 --> 1:04:22.200]  please put a link up there so for folks to buy the dvd there in the description to the side
[1:04:22.200 --> 1:04:25.720]  because we need to make some of our money back but it doesn't matter we have no future anyways
[1:04:25.720 --> 1:04:32.520]  we don't wake folks up but by exposing obama if we can shoot down his agenda if we can show he's
[1:04:32.520 --> 1:04:37.320]  a corporate fraud and not an anti-establishment guy that this new world order takeover is going
[1:04:37.320 --> 1:04:42.120]  to fail their attempt to bring in martial law will fail it failed when the bushes tried it as
[1:04:42.120 --> 1:04:49.160]  they had nazi agents and 35 in the u.s it failed when the reagan people tried it in 84 it's it
[1:04:49.160 --> 1:04:54.440]  they've been trying this over and over again we're gonna beat them again ladies and gentlemen

[1:08:21.480 --> 1:08:32.200]  jones you know i've got an analogy to describe how barack obama is conning everybody especially
[1:08:32.200 --> 1:08:40.600]  black americans well some of the analogy are parable it's true stories i i scan around xm radio
[1:08:40.600 --> 1:08:46.120]  and amon fm radio i listened like two or three minutes to bbc and then i'll flip to this i'll
[1:08:46.120 --> 1:08:50.200]  flip to that and i'm at being trafficked for 45 minutes so i hear a wide spectrum of it and i listen
[1:08:50.200 --> 1:08:58.200]  to uh the left channel is what they call it i think it's channel 144 on my xm in my car
[1:09:00.200 --> 1:09:06.680]  and they had uh the talk show host he's got a saturday night show on um forget his name on um
[1:09:07.880 --> 1:09:12.760]  cnn now he's a black guy and he had a mortgage expert on
[1:09:15.400 --> 1:09:19.800]  talking about the scams that are running and he had black collar after black collar so i ended up
[1:09:19.800 --> 1:09:24.600]  listening more than three minutes i listened all the way home last night talking about how they had
[1:09:25.960 --> 1:09:32.840]  nice friendly black people call them up to refinance their mortgages in 2001 2002 these people
[1:09:32.840 --> 1:09:40.200]  have good jobs paying their mortgages and they would use you know a pro empowerment black agenda
[1:09:40.200 --> 1:09:43.800]  and they live they were listing the companies on air the guest he had almost aware of it all
[1:09:43.800 --> 1:09:50.840]  and confirming it and he was reading articles and they were describing how then they would go down to
[1:09:50.840 --> 1:09:55.960]  the brokerage place to then refinance and it would be black people but of course it's a big
[1:09:55.960 --> 1:10:01.720]  globalist predominantly white owned company and how they would then rip them off and cheat them on
[1:10:01.720 --> 1:10:06.040]  the mortgage and actually make it a lot you know you know worse financial deal than they previously
[1:10:06.040 --> 1:10:10.920]  had and then how they went to court and beat them but still you know they won't change the mortgage
[1:10:10.920 --> 1:10:17.000]  and i mean that's all it is folks uh white slave traders going into the gold coast of africa and
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:21.400]  the transatlantic slave trade they had blacks delivering them the slaves that would go inland
[1:10:21.400 --> 1:10:28.520]  and capture black tribes i mean it's so elementary that the new world order will put a black face on
[1:10:28.520 --> 1:10:36.120]  itself their agenda was imploding their agenda was falling apart the country was on the edge of
[1:10:36.120 --> 1:10:40.360]  real revolution as krs one says in the obama deception and they put a black face on the new
[1:10:40.360 --> 1:10:49.000]  world order by just sat back and said okay i'm standing down and it's that simple and and i'm
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:54.600]  not saying that white people are innately evil i'm just speaking about what empires do when white
[1:10:54.600 --> 1:11:00.680]  people were enslaving white people when julius caesar for two decades was taking over gall
[1:11:00.680 --> 1:11:06.600]  which is france today and in germania which is germany and austria and other areas he would go
[1:11:06.600 --> 1:11:11.240]  in and he would use one germanic chief to go after the next germanic chief or he'd get
[1:11:11.240 --> 1:11:15.880]  one germanic chief to con than his group to going into slavery by paying him off
[1:11:17.320 --> 1:11:25.800]  so that's how this works ladies and gentlemen and it's that simple obama has lied about everything
[1:11:25.800 --> 1:11:31.320]  and is betraying you because he's a frontman who was financed by the big banks what did you think
[1:11:31.320 --> 1:11:37.400]  he was going to do now i look i said i want to call a bunch of calls today but every caller
[1:11:37.400 --> 1:11:40.840]  has been such important information i was spending about five minutes with each caller
[1:11:40.840 --> 1:11:45.960]  i promise in the next seven road justin robert room ejj and a bunch of folks but so i get to
[1:11:45.960 --> 1:11:49.480]  everybody you each get one minute i'm just gonna sit here shut up and let you make your point i'm
[1:11:49.480 --> 1:11:53.240]  going to the next person because i want to take a lot of calls today and i'm really mad at myself
[1:11:53.240 --> 1:11:57.240]  that i'm just can hardly ever make myself do this i want to try today to take a lot of calls
[1:11:57.240 --> 1:12:03.320]  and i got a bunch of news coming up too but for the next to 10 minutes or so i wanted to
[1:12:03.960 --> 1:12:09.800]  bring up tyler palmer who comes on with this once a month because preparedness is very important
[1:12:09.800 --> 1:12:14.440]  and a lot of listeners have gotten these have been very excited by him but other people email me
[1:12:14.440 --> 1:12:19.480]  and call me and say i don't understand how this works well it's very simple
[1:12:19.480 --> 1:12:27.480]  in 30 000 feet in the first 30 000 feet of the atmosphere on average if they condense all the
[1:12:27.480 --> 1:12:33.320]  water down that's in it on an average humidity day there's over 30 feet of water there's also
[1:12:33.320 --> 1:12:43.800]  about an inch in the first 50 000 feet of the atmosphere of rock that's right rock and dust
[1:12:43.800 --> 1:12:51.240]  and pieces of wood and pieces of dead insects and coal and potash and everything else from volcanoes
[1:12:53.640 --> 1:12:57.080]  if you condense the first 50 000 feet of the atmosphere down to the ground
[1:12:57.080 --> 1:12:59.640]  you would have at least an inch of dirt in your hand
[1:13:03.160 --> 1:13:06.920]  and it would be an inch of dirt that would cover you know everything for every
[1:13:06.920 --> 1:13:15.960]  square inch you'd have an inch of dirt well you also have 30 plus feet of water that's what clouds
[1:13:15.960 --> 1:13:21.240]  are now by the way that's that's what blocks out most the solar radiation you hear about the
[1:13:21.240 --> 1:13:25.880]  astronauts there's a solar flare have to run get inside a compartment in the space station
[1:13:26.600 --> 1:13:31.080]  inside the water tanks because the water is a shield well that's just a few feet of it
[1:13:31.800 --> 1:13:35.640]  that's what you hear about airline pilots above 30 000 feet get the equivalent of thousands of
[1:13:35.640 --> 1:13:41.400]  chest x-rays in their you know decades of flying but i'm going off into a side issue and i apologize
[1:13:41.400 --> 1:13:50.440]  for that but but this is the radiation shield of the earth is the water and the dirt in the
[1:13:50.440 --> 1:13:55.880]  atmosphere now these machines grab water out of the air it sends it through seven filters and gives
[1:13:55.880 --> 1:14:00.520]  you the best water you can pull stuff out of a well pull stuff out of the tap you can put it
[1:14:00.520 --> 1:14:04.840]  through filters it it'll cut out a lot of stuff but not everything the only way to cut it all out
[1:14:04.840 --> 1:14:11.400]  is the acola blue system tyler palmer the inventor and chief uh officer there at acola blue dot com
[1:14:11.400 --> 1:14:17.080]  thanks for coming on sir thank you alex good to be on again and uh that that was an interesting
[1:14:17.080 --> 1:14:24.200]  fact about the first uh 30 000 uh feet of the atmosphere condensing into 30 feet of water
[1:14:24.200 --> 1:14:31.880]  uh and having a visual image of a a flood of biblical proportion well that's what it is that's
[1:14:31.880 --> 1:14:37.800]  why we don't die from the radiation that's right and a lot of scientists believe uh life evolved
[1:14:38.520 --> 1:14:46.040]  in the ocean because that's where uh it was protected from the uv radiation because before
[1:14:46.040 --> 1:14:52.120]  we had the the the thick atmosphere it would burn anything on the land that's correct absolutely
[1:14:52.120 --> 1:14:55.720]  and carbon dioxide is a big part of that shield which they've now listed as a deadly chemical
[1:14:55.720 --> 1:15:00.040]  weapon basically they have to tax tell us about the acola blue because folks need to take advantage
[1:15:00.040 --> 1:15:04.600]  of this and when you do come on once a month you always offer a huge discount right well um
[1:15:05.400 --> 1:15:12.440]  we're introducing a new uh it's not a new acola blue unit but it does have one new feature um
[1:15:12.440 --> 1:15:21.160]  the lower storage tank is now lined with stainless steel and includes an extra uv light and uh if you
[1:15:21.160 --> 1:15:28.360]  order uh within the next week uh we're going to throw in a two-year supply of filters for free
[1:15:28.360 --> 1:15:36.520]  to any listener who mentions the alex jones show but the uh the the the catch is you have to call
[1:15:36.520 --> 1:15:42.040]  our 800 uh number to do that you can't do it over the uh the website yeah because you guys
[1:15:42.040 --> 1:15:46.520]  would have to change all the prices for everybody that's just for the you folks the toll free number
[1:15:46.520 --> 1:16:00.200]  that's 800-691-6043 and uh again 800-691-6043 and if you're calling from outside of the country
[1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:09.960]  canada europe um it's 925-231-0206 and we're gonna have those numbers out in a minute but you know
[1:16:09.960 --> 1:16:14.760]  something i want you guys to plug you have huge industrial units you have middle-sized units
[1:16:14.760 --> 1:16:19.800]  that mean the one you sell here right promote is the seven and a half gallon a day little unit
[1:16:19.800 --> 1:16:23.880]  that looks like a water cooler without the water bottle on top right but i really think you guys
[1:16:23.880 --> 1:16:28.840]  ought to promote uh the big units because there's a lot of ranchers a lot of restaurants a lot of
[1:16:28.840 --> 1:16:36.360]  people uh that i think should get your big units yeah and and we certainly are uh moving into that
[1:16:36.360 --> 1:16:44.120]  range of of promotion um a lot of customers call up and they want to be completely off-grid with their
[1:16:44.120 --> 1:16:51.800]  water um you know you can live a few days without uh water drinking water and uh so people want to
[1:16:51.800 --> 1:17:00.680]  be prepared and uh on average we're used to to using 80 to 100 gallons of water a day uh compared
[1:17:00.680 --> 1:17:07.000]  to in the middle ages when people got by on about five gallons a day so the the echo of
[1:17:07.000 --> 1:17:15.400]  u28 is really for uh supplementing uh your water not drinking fluoride contaminated water at home
[1:17:15.400 --> 1:17:22.680]  having control over your water but if you want to be off-grid showering in clean water and you
[1:17:22.680 --> 1:17:30.760]  know washing cooking all that in clean water uh we do have a unit unit the range of industrial
[1:17:30.760 --> 1:17:41.400]  units ranging from 200 to up to 5000 liters per day um and that's a uh 5000 liters is about let's
[1:17:41.400 --> 1:17:52.120]  see it's about 1315 gallons of water a day now uh not to be misleading that things about the size
[1:17:52.120 --> 1:17:58.120]  of a school bus but we do have something the the 200 liter per day which is the 70 gallon
[1:17:58.120 --> 1:18:05.800]  uh that translates to 70 gallons a day and the 500 they're they're very uh they're about the size of
[1:18:07.960 --> 1:18:13.240]  i don't know a small car maybe a really small car and a lot of governments and militaries buy
[1:18:13.240 --> 1:18:19.960]  these for those that uh want to get the regular a cola blue with a replacement of filters for a

[1:18:39.240 --> 1:18:45.480]  flood of biblical proportions or whatever happens and you need you know customer service centers

[1:24:29.080 --> 1:24:34.920]  40 minutes ed martin spokesman for missourians united for life they've uh basically filed a
[1:24:34.920 --> 1:24:41.160]  complaint in pursuit with the aclu against the governor and the mayak report he's now
[1:24:41.160 --> 1:24:47.640]  officially apologized after refusing to apologize last friday for saying pro livers are cop killing
[1:24:47.640 --> 1:24:52.920]  mass murders especially what the report says in total he's now had to back off and admit that
[1:24:52.920 --> 1:24:57.160]  it demonizes people like ron paul and others right now let's go to your phone calls just in
[1:24:57.160 --> 1:25:03.080]  in north carolina you're on the air hey alex how you doing today buddy good sir hey i was
[1:25:03.080 --> 1:25:06.680]  going to ask you something i i saw the obama deception i've actually watched it about three
[1:25:06.680 --> 1:25:11.400]  times i think it's a great film i think you did a really good job it doesn't demonize his character
[1:25:12.040 --> 1:25:16.840]  personally it just tackles the whole issue of the new order one of the things i want to ask you about
[1:25:16.840 --> 1:25:22.520]  it though uh i noticed when you were going over like his uh staff and everything he didn't mention
[1:25:22.520 --> 1:25:27.400]  in the film that most of them have dual citizenship with israel was there a reason that you decided
[1:25:27.400 --> 1:25:31.960]  to skip that or was that just a conscious decision on your part or you didn't think it was relevant
[1:25:31.960 --> 1:25:38.600]  or talk to me about that what what do you think this is what happened i get obsessed with research
[1:25:38.600 --> 1:25:44.360]  and literally taping hundreds of newscast reading documents piles of research and the guys came to
[1:25:44.360 --> 1:25:48.520]  me and they said look you've got to choose what you're putting in this we've got to get this off
[1:25:48.520 --> 1:25:53.000]  you know in the next couple weeks and get it done to have the dvds and have it for prison
[1:25:53.000 --> 1:26:00.200]  planet dot tv and no i meant to get into that i meant to get into the more esoteric stuff like
[1:26:00.200 --> 1:26:06.200]  his relationship to cheney and to bush how his cousins to him and then how bush was cousins to to
[1:26:07.400 --> 1:26:13.800]  carry i meant to get into how most of his cabinet has to step down before they ever even get
[1:26:13.800 --> 1:26:20.680]  approved by the senate because they're such a mafia thugs i meant to get into how more value
[1:26:20.680 --> 1:26:26.360]  wants to encircle russia how they are planning on destabilizing things i meant to get more
[1:26:26.360 --> 1:26:31.080]  into the faith-based initiative and we've got a big announcement coming up next week
[1:26:31.960 --> 1:26:36.440]  i'm just going to leave it at that i mean i got a big announcement coming up next week i'm just
[1:26:36.440 --> 1:26:44.280]  going to oh you know what i'll just go ahead and make the announcement now why wait uh why do it
[1:26:46.200 --> 1:26:51.560]  july 4th i'm coming out with a second obama film okay with all the material that that hit the
[1:26:51.560 --> 1:26:55.400]  cutting room floor and all the new stuff he's done like the draft being passed the house
[1:26:56.120 --> 1:27:02.360]  like the bailout to openly announcing world government uh the israeli connection uh the
[1:27:02.360 --> 1:27:10.040]  the all the crux in his administration uh all of that but but but this first film the obama
[1:27:10.040 --> 1:27:17.880]  deception this first film was just meant to explain hey let's stop being children both bush and
[1:27:19.240 --> 1:27:26.600]  obama and mccain they all over the same policies different rhetoric and it it was meant to show
[1:27:26.600 --> 1:27:32.840]  that the bankers are collapsing the society to bring in martial law that's the main message
[1:27:32.840 --> 1:27:37.720]  is the bankers are enemy and they're above the law criminals and they're openly announcing
[1:27:37.720 --> 1:27:41.720]  that they're above the law and kissinger saying obama is going to bring in the new world order
[1:27:41.720 --> 1:27:50.680]  that's this film is for the uninitiated this film i didn't want distractions and i was some of the
[1:27:50.680 --> 1:27:54.600]  things i was going to add some of the things i surround a time but other things if you make it
[1:27:54.600 --> 1:28:01.400]  if it has too much i wanted the film to be 90 minutes it ended up being 112 or 22 minutes longer
[1:28:01.400 --> 1:28:06.120]  than i wanted the average attention span for the most effective documentary is about 85 minutes
[1:28:06.840 --> 1:28:11.720]  usually i make three hour films you know like uh you know two hours 40 minutes long for in game
[1:28:11.720 --> 1:28:20.680]  three hours long plus for martial law rise the police state so yes uh tarpoli is coming to austin

[1:33:45.640 --> 1:33:50.520]  part that it plays in all this stuff as far as it goes with the uh the illuminati in the new world
[1:33:50.520 --> 1:33:54.600]  order well you know i've covered that in films like terror storm that never makes people happy

[1:36:11.400 --> 1:36:17.640]  one of your gentleman's mailbox um i'd like to thank you for making the obama deception
[1:36:18.280 --> 1:36:23.560]  i don't have any critique maybe if uh people do want to show it to different audiences depending
[1:36:23.560 --> 1:36:28.200]  on which audience you want they might want to you know maybe make your own edit as far as
[1:36:28.200 --> 1:36:34.120]  showing the whole movie um but as far as that it's an excellent excellent thing you do and i'm
[1:36:34.120 --> 1:36:41.080]  glad that you are adding to it you might have to make a whole book series out of it um the other
[1:36:41.080 --> 1:36:45.960]  thing i wanted to bring up is uh you know i was sitting back my wife taped a bunch of movies for
[1:36:45.960 --> 1:36:52.520]  me and i i just got a new um uh appreciation for battlefield earth that john's volt movie
[1:36:53.400 --> 1:36:55.480]  because it just seems like that's what's going on
[1:36:55.480 --> 1:37:06.120]  i hear you it's just it's just insane anything else sir uh no um i'll be writing some letters
[1:37:06.120 --> 1:37:10.840]  there pretty soon from the campaign liberty and um what specifically is going on with the cps in
[1:37:10.840 --> 1:37:16.200]  california man other grabbing homeschooler children now and just kidnapping more children
[1:37:16.200 --> 1:37:23.000]  outside of the uh proper legal system well specifically uh right now we are uh being
[1:37:23.000 --> 1:37:27.800]  called emergency workers so that's the way if there's a disaster or some sort of uh
[1:37:29.160 --> 1:37:33.320]  event here in los angeles county that anybody who works for the county including children's
[1:37:33.320 --> 1:37:39.160]  services will be put into certain areas where they would you know benefit whatever's going on
[1:37:39.160 --> 1:37:44.280]  whether it's uh counting how many people go on yeah sure that's been in mainstream news for those
[1:37:44.280 --> 1:37:50.120]  that don't know county cities everything is being federalized under the threat fusion centers
[1:37:50.120 --> 1:37:55.480]  the emergency management centers and uh they're going to try to forcibly inoculate all the medical
[1:37:55.480 --> 1:38:00.760]  workers and emergency workers first 14 million of them they already tried that in 2003 remember
[1:38:00.760 --> 1:38:07.400]  with a smallpox shot but most of them refuse 99% refuse according to the LA Times so it's it's very
[1:38:07.400 --> 1:38:12.840]  very serious um the other thing is that they're asking a lot of studies are from the congressional
[1:38:12.840 --> 1:38:18.040]  part of it on what we can do to better service our clients are basically uh what is the reporting
[1:38:18.040 --> 1:38:22.760]  um levels that we need to report as far as like drug addiction and things like that and
[1:38:22.760 --> 1:38:26.600]  services that we put out or or basically just handling of the case period
[1:38:28.520 --> 1:38:34.040]  so they're they're collecting all their data they need to uh i guess bring your trap
[1:38:36.840 --> 1:38:43.080]  amazing uh so what are the um workers saying are they starting to figure out what's happening
[1:38:43.080 --> 1:38:49.480]  uh fewer figure are figuring out what's happening um i live in obama land at the moment i see his
[1:38:49.480 --> 1:38:57.480]  picture in this photograph and a big cardboard cut out every time i stand up um so if i can't
[1:38:57.480 --> 1:39:03.080]  wait until i get my copies of uh the obama deception that ordered so i can start handing them out like
[1:39:03.080 --> 1:39:10.440]  candy um they might not like me afterwards but you know i'm not going to sit there and not give
[1:39:10.440 --> 1:39:20.760]  them the information in the truth so it's it's it's it's just a you know weird situation living
[1:39:20.760 --> 1:39:26.760]  in here with on my cubicle 9-11 was an inside job and some people walk by and they look and then i
[1:39:26.760 --> 1:39:32.280]  also have a small little picture that i keep on the wall here says the new american piggy bank
[1:39:32.280 --> 1:39:39.640]  it's this pig that's been initiated you know all you see is its ribs and bones well you know i
[1:39:39.640 --> 1:39:45.640]  criticize the system because a hundred years ago in england the united states they set up the family
[1:39:45.640 --> 1:39:50.760]  courts to carry out eugenics we cover it in endgame but i do know that there is also a lot of bad
[1:39:50.760 --> 1:39:55.320]  things going on in society i know that all social workers are not bad i've met quite a few that are
[1:39:55.320 --> 1:40:00.760]  good you know my biggest criticism is there's also a lot of scum involved and a lot of abusers
[1:40:00.760 --> 1:40:05.400]  that get involved evidence by all the arrests that are made continually and i just don't know how good
[1:40:05.400 --> 1:40:11.320]  people like yourself can stay in that situation i know that for cps workers it's over a 50% yearly
[1:40:11.320 --> 1:40:17.400]  turnover people go get degrees and uh in this and then you know for the right reasons and they get
[1:40:17.400 --> 1:40:24.680]  into it and just can't stand staying in it can you speak to that uh most of the workers that i know
[1:40:24.680 --> 1:40:29.400]  express to the ones that i work with we work in an adoptions part of the situation oh so you're
[1:40:29.400 --> 1:40:36.120]  in the world the wicked part i got you yeah and and and those who did actually work in those areas
[1:40:36.120 --> 1:40:41.320]  have either come over here or like you said have turned over or sort of resign their to their fate
[1:40:41.320 --> 1:40:47.960]  in life um and whatever else that might be in the office they're pretty much either well hidden or
[1:40:47.960 --> 1:40:54.280]  in their own little group so we really don't deal with them except uh after all the the
[1:40:54.280 --> 1:40:58.920]  termination parental rights and all those things that have to go through as far as the the
[1:40:58.920 --> 1:41:04.520]  semi-legal system as they call it amazing amazing good to hear from you i appreciate the call
[1:41:05.640 --> 1:41:10.760]  let's go ahead and talk to groom in maryland groom you're on the air how you doing uh
[1:41:11.880 --> 1:41:19.080]  how you doing alex good sir another young supporter uh here in maryland uh i find your
[1:41:19.080 --> 1:41:27.080]  um your documentary really compelling i mean uh got a lot of clear arguments and i found what i
[1:41:27.080 --> 1:41:33.080]  for the claim that ron paul's brother made that really stuck out to me is that um and we're really
[1:41:33.080 --> 1:41:39.880]  uh operating under emergency powers i found that really no no that's a fact yeah i know that i found
[1:41:39.880 --> 1:41:45.320]  that i find it shocking but i found it really compelling because that's when you state that
[1:41:45.320 --> 1:41:50.120]  fact it really sticks out on people's head that social security and all that's just basically
[1:41:50.120 --> 1:41:55.960]  a collateral we put up we were put up as collateral i mean yeah they take our money and then give us
[1:41:55.960 --> 1:42:03.400]  a pittance back it's about domestication it's literal slavery and i mean uh yeah i've been
[1:42:03.400 --> 1:42:09.000]  trying to spread the word out here in uh around the high schools you know i'm trying to major in
[1:42:09.000 --> 1:42:13.640]  economics and really because i think that's the prime component of us really getting out of the
[1:42:13.640 --> 1:42:19.800]  struggle what are folks saying and doing when you send them the obama deception link oh matter
[1:42:19.800 --> 1:42:30.200]  of fact um another interesting thing that happened to me uh i sent um you know hr 1388 the bill on the
[1:42:31.640 --> 1:42:39.640]  on uh the youth brigades i sent that to my practical law teacher and he was utterly stunned
[1:42:39.640 --> 1:42:45.160]  like he didn't even know about it i mentioned it in class and he just he just didn't know what to
[1:42:45.160 --> 1:42:50.680]  say i was like he he said oh that's horrible it's not ever gonna pass the way it's um the way he's
[1:42:50.680 --> 1:42:57.480]  worried about like it was just stunned me that you know we just passed things off and it just the
[1:42:57.480 --> 1:43:03.720]  lightning speed that this you know new world order is coming is it's scary but i mean that's all
[1:43:03.720 --> 1:43:08.920]  barack obama is is a distraction and when they're done with him they're gonna destroy his name as well
[1:43:08.920 --> 1:43:14.920]  and it it's a total setup and just keep warning people keep passing them the free link that's up
[1:43:14.920 --> 1:43:19.720]  on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com the best internet version we found out the best

[1:43:29.640 --> 1:43:37.080]  good work ej in texas ej go ahead hey how's it going good sir i haven't had a chance to talk with
[1:43:37.080 --> 1:43:42.520]  people about their reviews of your film i just got back from out of town but um i promised to do
[1:43:42.520 --> 1:43:47.320]  that and i'll call back sometime with that but i have a one question and and a couple of comments
[1:43:47.320 --> 1:43:53.080]  i'll try to be brief the question is that when you have back to carly on a few days ago towards
[1:43:53.080 --> 1:43:59.080]  the end of one of the segment um you had quickly mentioned how vaccines leech out of the children's
[1:43:59.080 --> 1:44:04.680]  bodies and i'd like to understand more about that maybe where i could go to read about that okay the
[1:44:04.680 --> 1:44:10.680]  the the viral fragments or the complete viruses that are separate from what the vaccine you know
[1:44:10.680 --> 1:44:14.920]  supposedly you know let's say it's a flu shot that has five or six different variants of flu
[1:44:14.920 --> 1:44:21.640]  a wide spectrum flu it is grown uh on dead baby parts all over the world they just legalized
[1:44:21.640 --> 1:44:27.480]  that here in the u.s. it's grown on monkey parts ground up kidneys and other things and then all
[1:44:27.480 --> 1:44:34.200]  of their viruses similar to human viruses the zoological viruses this is mainline science merge
[1:44:34.200 --> 1:44:39.800]  and then there's also dna fragments of micro plasms all of this mixes and combines with bacteria
[1:44:39.800 --> 1:44:46.760]  and viruses in the body and then leeches out creating new strains of viruses they're also
[1:44:46.760 --> 1:44:51.720]  carried by bacteria but more than that they admitted when they were trying to force the troops and
[1:44:51.720 --> 1:44:57.640]  the firemen and the police everybody else to take the smallpox shot 2002 2003 i remember they said
[1:44:57.640 --> 1:45:00.440]  you have to take it there was no law they just said you have to take it just like they tell
[1:45:00.440 --> 1:45:04.760]  citizens we have to take stuff with no law but thank god the police and military and even
[1:45:04.760 --> 1:45:07.640]  tommy thompson refused to take it though he's saying everybody else had to take it
[1:45:08.440 --> 1:45:13.160]  that they were admitting that it could actually cause and was causing some localized smallpox
[1:45:13.160 --> 1:45:18.840]  outbreaks that have been extinct in the western world because it was a live smallpox injection
[1:45:19.560 --> 1:45:24.760]  okay so so people can actually get what they're being vaccinated for here's an example really
[1:45:24.760 --> 1:45:31.880]  nice lady family friend a nurse known my grandmother since high school uh she took a shingle shot
[1:45:32.440 --> 1:45:37.640]  a vaccine right when it came out last year and almost killed her she got shingles and they said
[1:45:37.640 --> 1:45:43.000]  it was a bad vaccine reaction so there's just case after case look at the swine flu epidemic
[1:45:43.000 --> 1:45:48.920]  so yes they leech out sir okay well i think it'd be really good to have dr. deagle on there again

[1:48:51.480 --> 1:48:57.960]  uh love the show um i was i have a question um earlier in late january you had jordan
[1:48:57.960 --> 1:49:04.280]  Maxwell on the show yes and uh do you and he discussed kind of casually about getting together
[1:49:04.280 --> 1:49:10.600]  and making some information available about the obama symbol about the rising sun and i just heard
[1:49:10.600 --> 1:49:14.200]  that you're gonna make another obama film and i was wondering if you might incorporate that
[1:49:14.200 --> 1:49:18.200]  in that next film you know here's the deal i'm very honored that jordan has reached out on
[1:49:18.200 --> 1:49:25.320]  and off air to me to be the director of a film about the sum of his work uh and i've told jordan
[1:49:25.320 --> 1:49:31.560]  that it gives me specifics and tells me you know i have to have a script i have to know what he
[1:49:31.560 --> 1:49:37.400]  wants to do i can't go make a film about jordan Maxwell he wants it about specifics and so i
[1:49:37.400 --> 1:49:42.840]  can only do so much but uh a lot of people are interested in that i would tell jordan not to
[1:49:42.840 --> 1:49:47.560]  wait just to go ahead and make it himself or work with some other folks um i mean i'm sure it would
[1:49:47.560 --> 1:49:51.720]  be a very successful film and reach a lot of people we know what black sun symbolizes that was the
[1:49:51.720 --> 1:49:58.680]  secret nazi symbol that's an ancient symbol that goes way back thousands of years uh and uh it it
[1:49:58.680 --> 1:50:03.880]  deals with mass extermination and we've we've you know we've covered it here and it's a very
[1:50:03.880 --> 1:50:10.280]  occultic symbol that obama uses yeah it's very hypnotic too all right well that's all i want

[1:54:46.760 --> 1:54:52.040]  i've been trying to get through them for a month now and it's so hard to get through your show and
[1:54:52.040 --> 1:54:56.920]  there's so many things i wanted to talk about a month ago are already being covered up by new
[1:54:56.920 --> 1:55:02.520]  things it's amazing the quickening but so i decided that to change the pace a little bit
[1:55:02.520 --> 1:55:09.240]  i just wanted to take my opportunity to thank you personally alex i speak on behalf of so many
[1:55:09.240 --> 1:55:16.600]  people i know you're a humble man but you and your staff are loved and respected and admired by
[1:55:16.600 --> 1:55:22.600]  so many people i know the sacrifice involved i hear you sometimes you're talking to these idiots
[1:55:22.600 --> 1:55:27.960]  and it sounds like your head's gonna explode and i have to laugh because i've been there and i am
[1:55:27.960 --> 1:55:33.640]  there still well the reason i continue on is because i know we have so many great people that
[1:55:33.640 --> 1:55:38.680]  support us but more importantly are out there fighting right beside us but the attacks especially
[1:55:38.680 --> 1:55:44.600]  with this obama film coming out are coming from every quarter especially operatives that pose on
[1:55:44.600 --> 1:55:51.080]  our own movement uh just just just everywhere but that means we're on target so we're gonna continue
[1:55:51.960 --> 1:55:57.960]  absolutely and one other thing i i want to say alex it it's it's kind of funny i heard you

[2:01:30.760 --> 2:01:35.480]  soon as he finally got the chance to read the letter from congressman ron paul bob bar and uh others
[2:01:39.080 --> 2:01:45.320]  so that is coming up in the next segment right now let's go ahead and go back to the calls

[2:02:03.000 --> 2:02:09.080]  ask you what are they saying when they get a copy um people i think people are pretty surprised some
[2:02:09.080 --> 2:02:15.000]  people are pretty hesitant to take it um but and i've got death threats to people telling me that i
[2:02:15.000 --> 2:02:20.440]  should be killed or and call me a republican or a racist and and all that too but my main reason
[2:02:20.440 --> 2:02:27.640]  for the call is um the draft bill passed the senate 74 to 14 i don't know if you were aware of that
[2:02:27.640 --> 2:02:31.960]  no i wasn't i can't keep track of it all what is the senate bill on that i actually had it printed

[2:02:46.520 --> 2:02:53.240]  thursday um but uh i i predicted it would pass the senate because they're even more globalist
[2:02:53.240 --> 2:03:00.200]  than the house on average it passed the house about what over a hundred plus votes uh compared to the
[2:03:00.840 --> 2:03:05.720]  nae votes it was just amazing and it says they're going to set up a federal agency to set up compulsory

[2:08:27.720 --> 2:08:36.440]  now that's what they called it before they changed the name uh to something else it passed the
[2:08:38.440 --> 2:08:41.960]  house last thursday we wrote an article about that i was just scrambling during the three
[2:08:41.960 --> 2:08:46.840]  minute break because the caller spurred me to think about that i thought i had it in my stack
[2:08:46.840 --> 2:08:51.560]  today to cover on air i don't we're floundering around trying to get all these together paul
[2:08:51.560 --> 2:08:57.960]  watson's going to have that at the 20 after and the senate version and it's just so much
[2:08:57.960 --> 2:09:02.360]  is happening so fast i can't even keep track of this anymore they've got bills on the verge
[2:09:02.360 --> 2:09:07.160]  of passing to basically ban gardens without federal licensing the feds are taking everything over
[2:09:07.720 --> 2:09:10.360]  two weeks ago we broke the myack report
[2:09:14.120 --> 2:09:19.160]  here on air and now that's gotten international attention the governor wouldn't apologize and
[2:09:19.160 --> 2:09:24.280]  said he backed it last friday in the associated press then the governor a legal action was
[2:09:24.280 --> 2:09:35.000]  started against him ron paul sent him a letter and ba bar sent him a letter together uh with
[2:09:35.000 --> 2:09:39.400]  chuck baldwin and they he's now saying that you know he repudiates the fact that ron paul and
[2:09:39.400 --> 2:09:42.840]  others are listed in that and that it does demonize them and their supporters wrongfully
[2:09:42.840 --> 2:09:49.240]  equating them with terror so that's some that's some good news and here is the uh march 24th article
[2:09:49.240 --> 2:09:58.440]  expanding national service new york times and uh yeah this is the new york times reporting today
[2:09:58.440 --> 2:10:03.480]  on the 24th that it was before the senate for a vote now we're getting calls and it did pass
[2:10:03.480 --> 2:10:13.080]  uh i mean this is just off the charts it gave me a few things give me an instant headache
[2:10:14.520 --> 2:10:20.120]  but this just did it i'm trying to find the name of the bill here because it's in the
[2:10:20.120 --> 2:10:24.680]  article but we write so many articles i can't find it on prisonplanet.com the detailed one
[2:10:24.680 --> 2:10:35.480]  just unbelievable just this country is going to hell in a handbasket ed martin's spokesman
[2:10:35.480 --> 2:10:40.200]  for the missourians united for life pro-life cribs were demonized basically as terrorist
[2:10:40.200 --> 2:10:44.040]  cop killers as well in this missouri document that the feds wrote the governor says the feds
[2:10:44.040 --> 2:10:49.480]  wrote it we already knew that so i want to bring him up uh they have moved uh civil libertarians
[2:10:49.480 --> 2:10:53.880]  liberties complaint filed against governor j nixon for abusive state law enforcement
[2:10:53.880 --> 2:10:59.000]  temporarily restraining order sought against nixon in u.s district court and that's good
[2:10:59.000 --> 2:11:04.840]  to have you on with us sir thank you sir thanks for having me uh you know i i should if you
[2:11:04.840 --> 2:11:09.640]  don't mind i'd like to clarify a couple things that you actually uh were more optimistic than
[2:11:09.640 --> 2:11:15.640]  the facts on the ground uh warrant um what is actually true is uh that the governor of the
[2:11:15.640 --> 2:11:21.240]  state of missouri has not apologized to anyone he trotted out a bureaucrat uh to apologize
[2:11:21.240 --> 2:11:26.120]  of the apology candidly simply says we're going to take the names of the third party
[2:11:26.120 --> 2:11:31.560]  candidates uh bar ball went in and paul out of the document but we're going to reissue the
[2:11:31.560 --> 2:11:36.440]  document so uh they're standing by the facts they're just trying to sugarcoat things and the
[2:11:36.440 --> 2:11:43.320]  the governor governor j nixon continues uh to uh stand by the statements in here in this incredible
[2:11:43.320 --> 2:11:48.840]  document that is um uh you know i have now have some sources and i'm trying to put it together
[2:11:48.840 --> 2:11:54.200]  that a lot of the language was lifted from some of the left wing uh organizations uh
[2:11:54.200 --> 2:11:59.080]  websites and and reports and things i'm trying to figure out exactly where but this is um
[2:11:59.080 --> 2:12:04.360]  this is exactly the kind of stuff we feared when last year again in missouri we saw the
[2:12:04.360 --> 2:12:09.640]  obama true squads uh with prosecutors bob mcculloch of st louis county saying they're
[2:12:09.640 --> 2:12:15.720]  going to use uh local law enforcement if they don't like what someone says about then canada obama
[2:12:15.720 --> 2:12:20.680]  um you know we're we're i know and and and we reported that out of the local newspaper
[2:12:20.680 --> 2:12:25.080]  in kansas city and people thought we were making it up on air then we played newscast with the
[2:12:25.080 --> 2:12:30.760]  police and prosecutors saying if you talk bad about him we'll decide if it's a lie and we will
[2:12:30.760 --> 2:12:37.480]  prosecute you that was on the news and the previous governor repudiated it and yes the adl in southern
[2:12:37.480 --> 2:12:41.960]  poverty law center that's who writes this for the feds i've seen these reports from all the other
[2:12:41.960 --> 2:12:48.760]  states and they it's just outrageous yeah it sure is and again what's um what we're seeing in
[2:12:48.760 --> 2:12:55.160]  missouri is um is the governor governor nixon is um he's really gone sort of uh more but just
[2:12:55.160 --> 2:13:00.520]  like president obama brazenly charging ahead i mean he's now uh targeting conservatives like this
[2:13:00.520 --> 2:13:06.040]  he's appointed the most brazenly pro illegal immigration uh cabinet director ever and when
[2:13:06.040 --> 2:13:10.520]  people started to make a noise he threatened to withhold funds from counties where people were
[2:13:10.520 --> 2:13:14.440]  bringing up the issue and you know it's just one thing after another and it has to make you really
[2:13:14.440 --> 2:13:20.520]  wonder and and worry absolutely our group our group charged ahead just to sorry to interrupt
[2:13:20.520 --> 2:13:25.080]  you our group charged ahead and and you know we have very little in common with the acl you too
[2:13:25.080 --> 2:13:30.360]  often uh but we went to the acl you and said you guys are supposed to be standing up for civil
[2:13:30.360 --> 2:13:36.920]  liberties this is uh an example and let's um let's use your own cloud and uh go ahead of course
[2:13:36.920 --> 2:13:41.000]  betraying their true colors we've not heard not an area word from them and they're not
[2:13:41.000 --> 2:13:45.960]  assisting in any way so i was wrong about that they're seeking you're seeking their help uh
[2:13:45.960 --> 2:13:53.560]  that that's that that's terrible um what was it like when your group first learned uh about the
[2:13:53.560 --> 2:13:59.480]  maniac report well it's it's exactly what you said earlier people um heard about it and they
[2:13:59.480 --> 2:14:04.680]  didn't know what to make of it so our group heard took calls from uh pro lifers and and christian
[2:14:04.680 --> 2:14:09.000]  conservatives who were you know who are going about their business and saying their prayers and
[2:14:09.000 --> 2:14:14.040]  and and being uh you know participants in democracy and they said what does this mean uh what what are
[2:14:14.040 --> 2:14:18.840]  they talking about i mean what am i supposed to not display a bumper sticker on my car because
[2:14:18.840 --> 2:14:25.080]  that's one of the things the report says and you know our this is what i i find so reprehensible
[2:14:25.080 --> 2:14:30.920]  when you put out a report like this this is why it chills free speech and behavior you put it out
[2:14:30.920 --> 2:14:37.000]  and then you apologize a bureaucrat in a closed door room with uh a few people and most of the
[2:14:37.000 --> 2:14:41.960]  people never hear the apology which wasn't named by the way christians or pro lifers or anything
[2:14:41.960 --> 2:14:47.160]  else and most people are are disturbed and they wonder what's going on and i don't know i think
[2:14:47.160 --> 2:14:51.480]  it's a very difficult time in america when our governments are behaving like they are it's very
[2:14:51.480 --> 2:14:59.480]  worrying absolutely um what do you think of obama and 13 million supporters going door to door this
[2:14:59.480 --> 2:15:05.160]  weekend trying people to quote pledge to go along with his economic military and domestic agenda and
[2:15:05.160 --> 2:15:12.040]  now the house has passed a national draft it says compulsory service and uh the the ap is reporting
[2:15:12.040 --> 2:15:17.640]  that the senate is taking up debate today we're getting calls saying it passed we haven't been able
[2:15:17.640 --> 2:15:23.240]  to confirm that yet i mean this is just totally unamerican this isn't just a military draft it's
[2:15:23.240 --> 2:15:29.880]  military as well this is a full takeover of society yeah and look what one of the things that um uh
[2:15:29.880 --> 2:15:34.520]  maybe this is what uh president obama meant by change one of the things that most candidates do
[2:15:34.520 --> 2:15:39.480]  and they're elected as they govern and they stop campaigning and they stop uh acting like a candidate
[2:15:39.480 --> 2:15:44.120]  and what president obama has made clear is uh you know he is not going to stop doing that and this
[2:15:44.120 --> 2:15:49.560]  these these door to door and these meetings and all it's less about uh governing and more about
[2:15:49.560 --> 2:15:56.200]  continuing to try to uh use use the media as well as uh grassroots to just persuade people in a way
[2:15:56.200 --> 2:16:03.960]  that i think is well that's it and no no that on cnn they call it an army they call it an army
[2:16:03.960 --> 2:16:09.080]  to to bully congress and the rest of the people along with it so i mean this is like musselini
[2:16:09.080 --> 2:16:14.280]  or or mal and that's how they modeled it even the washington post admits that to literally
[2:16:14.280 --> 2:16:20.280]  have his own private army and they run national tv ads for usaservice.org with federal money
[2:16:20.280 --> 2:16:26.600]  to then get people to join his private group i mean this is this is totally unamerican
[2:16:26.600 --> 2:16:31.240]  and the san francisco chronicle on friday admitted this is this has never been done before in the
[2:16:31.240 --> 2:16:38.200]  united states mm-hmm yeah i mean again i you know all politics is local and when when i see the
[2:16:38.200 --> 2:16:43.560]  state highway patrol and local law enforcement being hijacked by a governor who's so brazenly
[2:16:43.560 --> 2:16:47.800]  you know as you said the ap reporter you know governor janex just said well i sure i stand by
[2:16:47.800 --> 2:16:53.640]  it i know it's profiling christians and conservatives but i stand by it so brazen and you see obama so
[2:16:53.640 --> 2:17:00.200]  brazen i mean there's a something about america's greatness was a certain deference and respect
[2:17:00.200 --> 2:17:04.840]  to each other and for each other and for our individuality well mr martin as you know they
[2:17:04.840 --> 2:17:09.400]  are federalizing everything mainstream news putting regular arming in every major police
[2:17:09.400 --> 2:17:14.600]  department announcing 20 000 regular army troops to engage the american people the army war college
[2:17:14.600 --> 2:17:19.880]  admits that and this is bigger than obama bush helped set this up he passed it on to him this is
[2:17:19.880 --> 2:17:25.320]  the national security council as the new york times said literally taking over they told congress
[2:17:25.320 --> 2:17:31.880]  that they can't see pdd 51 the full document the cover sheet says the president is basically a
[2:17:31.880 --> 2:17:37.000]  dictator i mean i think that americans have had liberty so long they don't know how to recognize
[2:17:37.000 --> 2:17:41.800]  and the state police reports that the feds have written that they're putting out literally is to
[2:17:41.800 --> 2:17:46.040]  create a chilling effect where people are scared to be politically active that's why obama's people
[2:17:46.040 --> 2:17:52.360]  threatened to have police arrest folks that criticized him in your own state uh... this is secret police
[2:17:52.360 --> 2:17:56.440]  and this is meant to teach police and americans that are against the private federal reserve
[2:17:56.440 --> 2:18:02.920]  or against abortion or against gun control are cop killing terrorists i mean this is classic
[2:18:02.920 --> 2:18:08.280]  soviet style takeover you know it's very very disturbing i agree with you and i think more
[2:18:08.280 --> 2:18:12.840]  and more people my one hope is that more and more people are getting uh... more attentive

[2:25:37.240 --> 2:25:43.240]  look anything that is you said earlier the one thing we cannot do is sit around and feel sorry
[2:25:43.240 --> 2:25:49.160]  for ourselves i hate to quote bill clinton but i will he once said the only thing that a bully
[2:25:49.160 --> 2:25:54.440]  understands is when you punch him in the mouth and my opinion is that we we need to all stand up
[2:25:54.440 --> 2:26:00.120]  and realize we have a lot more to lose if we don't get our act together and push back and
[2:26:00.760 --> 2:26:04.680]  and that's what we're going to do so we're going to we have a group a coalition of pro-life groups
[2:26:04.680 --> 2:26:10.680]  christian groups uh anti-illegal immigration groups uh gun uh nra types that are all angry about
[2:26:10.680 --> 2:26:16.680]  this report uh we are not going to stop until these people know uh that they're wrong and
[2:26:16.680 --> 2:26:21.480]  that people are watching them so missouri's excuse me missouri united for life dot org is
[2:26:21.480 --> 2:26:25.800]  our website missouri united for life dot org is a bunch of press releases there and people can get
[2:26:25.800 --> 2:26:30.760]  on an email list and uh join the fight here in missouri and across the country well it's clear
[2:26:30.760 --> 2:26:34.760]  they're trying to create a chilling effect that i better not put a ron paul sticker or libertarian
[2:26:34.760 --> 2:26:39.080]  sticker or a pro-life sticker we even had in oklahoma where they took the guy's pro-life
[2:26:39.080 --> 2:26:43.400]  sign off his car and sent the secret service to his house i've got mainstream news or homeland
[2:26:43.400 --> 2:26:47.480]  security showing up people's houses that have bought more than a thousand rounds of ammo i mean
[2:26:47.480 --> 2:26:52.600]  this is secret police this is federalization being turned loose on us the good news is the
[2:26:52.600 --> 2:26:56.840]  military and police themselves are very upset by all this that's why i'm being given all these
[2:26:56.840 --> 2:27:01.800]  secret documents you know we got the mark report yeah exactly i think that's one of the things
[2:27:01.800 --> 2:27:06.920]  that we have to count on is that we have to uh we have to try to realize that there are uh good
[2:27:06.920 --> 2:27:11.880]  men and women inside the state police and other places who will who will recognize uh but you
[2:27:11.880 --> 2:27:15.800]  know what what's happening is that the federal government the state government state law enforcement
[2:27:15.800 --> 2:27:20.280]  are are rooting out those people whatever they can i mean take of the guys on the border patrol
[2:27:20.280 --> 2:27:25.000]  that stood up for the right things and ended up going to jail and also you know it's it is a serious
[2:27:25.000 --> 2:27:30.760]  deal in missouri this mark report is you know it's even worse than just uh uh putting a sticker on
[2:27:30.760 --> 2:27:36.520]  that says i'm for a third party if you have flags historic flags that relate to our history
[2:27:36.520 --> 2:27:42.360]  one flag which was flown in the war on terrorism is a is on there that means the people may be in a
[2:27:42.360 --> 2:27:48.520]  law-breaking you know uh militiamen this yeah the the the the the the don't tread on me flag
[2:27:48.520 --> 2:27:54.200]  is used by the army the marines we have one hanging in my office that this was this was
[2:27:54.200 --> 2:27:59.560]  usually a lot less you're on the watch list already well let's you know what you know you
[2:27:59.560 --> 2:28:05.560]  you know who should be on the watch list who should be on the watch list uh are the private banks
[2:28:05.560 --> 2:28:08.840]  like the federal reserve that go before the senate and say we won't tell you where the
[2:28:08.840 --> 2:28:13.560]  trillions of dollars have gone you know that's who needs you know these are the un-american
[2:28:13.560 --> 2:28:20.440]  groups bringing our country down and it is just absolutely amazing uh that this is happening uh
[2:28:20.440 --> 2:28:26.360]  how angry has this made pro-life groups to be to be listed in there in missouri well it certainly
[2:28:26.360 --> 2:28:30.120]  got people fired up and again one of the things that we can use these moments to point out that
[2:28:30.120 --> 2:28:35.240]  hey now this isn't the only effort by the federal government to to take control of of our lives
[2:28:35.240 --> 2:28:40.760]  you know this federal legislation that would usurp all state limits on uh on pro-life issues on
[2:28:40.760 --> 2:28:45.480]  abortion that's the focal bill you know poorly named freedom of choice act but what we're finding
[2:28:45.480 --> 2:28:51.560]  is people are are almost confused by it because they're just like what what houses and they and
[2:28:51.560 --> 2:28:58.200]  they need we need to channel their their focus to how long this is and how we have to act so
[2:28:58.200 --> 2:29:02.040]  there is a sense uh you know and you you were a great service on this and others
[2:29:02.040 --> 2:29:07.080]  that have picked it up that it's starting to uh get to people's understanding of what exactly

[2:33:50.520 --> 2:33:56.200]  the nazis the soviets all of their systems youth brigades forced giraffes tattletail
[2:33:56.200 --> 2:34:02.360]  squads it has passed the house we're still trying to confirm if it's passed the senate ap reports
[2:34:02.360 --> 2:34:08.200]  they're debating it we don't have a headline yet they call it americor expanding national service
[2:34:08.200 --> 2:34:14.760]  in the new york times the ap calls it uh senate set to vote on expansion of americor but i have
[2:34:14.760 --> 2:34:20.680]  the bill here in front of me generations invigorating volunteerism and education act is a slightly
[2:34:20.680 --> 2:34:28.440]  different name in the senate and it is drafting into federal programs middle schoolers high
[2:34:28.440 --> 2:34:34.360]  schoolers and then three months to start out of the year 18 to 24 for military training what we
[2:34:34.360 --> 2:34:40.920]  cover in the obama deception this guy's in office two months and they've already basically got the
[2:34:40.920 --> 2:34:46.680]  sucker passed let's bring paul watson up i called him up freaked out 30 minutes ago told him to look
[2:34:46.680 --> 2:34:52.040]  and and we've been scrambling here trying to find it uh during the breaks paul has it passed the senate
[2:34:54.120 --> 2:35:00.680]  i don't believe it's passed yet alex is a new york times article editorial actually this morning
[2:35:01.400 --> 2:35:08.040]  lauding the virtues of it and saying that once the senate passes it it can be allied with some of
[2:35:08.040 --> 2:35:13.320]  the other similar proposals so i don't think i don't believe it's passed the senate yet i'm
[2:35:13.320 --> 2:35:20.280]  trying to look at the moment well regardless it's passed the house and i've read the ap and this
[2:35:20.280 --> 2:35:23.880]  and they don't say the name of the bill the caller said the name but we didn't write it down what is
[2:35:23.880 --> 2:35:32.200]  the name of the senate version well it'll be the same as the no no it has a slightly different
[2:35:32.200 --> 2:35:37.400]  one well we need to find out right now i mean you know what this is too important i'm just
[2:35:37.400 --> 2:35:41.640]  going to suspend the broadcast right now we'll go to music till i get on a computer i could find
[2:35:41.640 --> 2:35:46.840]  this in five minutes paul you know what you start going over your article from last thursday house
[2:35:46.840 --> 2:35:53.800]  passes mandatory national service bill then that dovetails uh with your um other article defense
[2:35:53.800 --> 2:35:58.360]  department announces civilian expeditionary workforce and it says for domestically or
[2:35:58.360 --> 2:36:04.200]  internationally a total force and it says uh management retains the authority to direct and
[2:36:04.200 --> 2:36:10.760]  assign civilian employees either voluntarily or involuntarily that's forced or on an unexpected
[2:36:10.760 --> 2:36:16.920]  basis to accomplish the do d mission so this is a nexus into the draft for the one million man army
[2:36:16.920 --> 2:36:22.840]  you go ahead and cover this i'm going to google it right now okay go ahead yeah i think the senate
[2:36:22.840 --> 2:36:29.960]  one is called the serve america act but that's not identical to the give act i'm i'm trying to look
[2:36:29.960 --> 2:36:35.720]  there obviously my internet connection has died at this exact moment but yeah the one we reported
[2:36:35.720 --> 2:36:42.600]  on last week was the generations invigorating volunteerism and education act known as the give
[2:36:42.600 --> 2:36:53.080]  act which was passed by 321 to 105 margin in the house and in the uh under section 6104
[2:36:53.080 --> 2:37:00.760]  under a section called duties it says that quote whether a workable fair reasonable
[2:37:00.760 --> 2:37:06.040]  mandatory service requirement for all able young people could be developed and how such
[2:37:06.040 --> 2:37:10.680]  a requirement could be implemented in a manner that would strengthen the social fabric of the
[2:37:10.680 --> 2:37:16.920]  nation and overcome civic challenges by bringing together people from diverse economic ethnic
[2:37:16.920 --> 2:37:24.120]  and educational backgrounds and then there was another section which is called youth engagement
[2:37:24.120 --> 2:37:31.800]  zone program which is similar to what the denny version of a similar bill says which talks about
[2:37:32.520 --> 2:37:39.160]  quote service learning which will be quote a mandatory part of the curriculum in all of the
[2:37:39.160 --> 2:37:48.360]  secondary schools served by the local educational agency and as he said with the defense department
[2:37:50.200 --> 2:37:58.440]  version which is the defense department employees the foreign missions states that quote management
[2:37:58.440 --> 2:38:06.360]  retains the authority to direct and design civilian employees either voluntarily involuntarily
[2:38:06.360 --> 2:38:14.120]  or on an unexpected basis to accomplish the do d mission so it's saying that basically
[2:38:14.840 --> 2:38:24.440]  even if it's involuntary do d civilian employees will be forced to support military missions abroad
[2:38:24.440 --> 2:38:28.920]  and i'll tell you they'll they'll only get the fake patriotism they need to ram this through
[2:38:28.920 --> 2:38:33.880]  with stage terror attacks or a new war understanding how they operate this is so unpopular they're
[2:38:33.880 --> 2:38:40.600]  only going to get this with a stage terror attack well biden biden promised that there
[2:38:40.600 --> 2:38:46.600]  will be a national crisis within what the first few months so it's happened with every other
[2:38:46.600 --> 2:38:52.040]  president basically so we should expect it to happen with obama well it's past the house and
[2:38:52.040 --> 2:38:59.160]  i'm on the senate website it says they're debating it right now um harry reid the senate majority
[2:38:59.160 --> 2:39:08.280]  leader said uh in the financial news wire he says the serve america act reid said will provide
[2:39:08.280 --> 2:39:13.880]  better opportunities for americans of all ages for all regions and walks of life to answer the call
[2:39:13.880 --> 2:39:24.680]  to service and it goes on it is forced service and yet and you know i mean it's just hitting me
[2:39:24.680 --> 2:39:30.520]  the last few days this is crazy this isn't just a draft where they sent 18 to 21 year olds to
[2:39:30.520 --> 2:39:36.200]  vietnam and and then and there's a lottery and all the rich people don't have to go this is for
[2:39:36.200 --> 2:39:40.920]  girls this is grabbing them and making them be under federal service when they're in middle school
[2:39:41.720 --> 2:39:48.120]  seventh and eighth grade this is in high school and then this is serving at military camps training
[2:39:48.840 --> 2:39:54.600]  in defense training for 18 to 24 and then they have all these other cores and they say it's mandatory
[2:39:54.600 --> 2:39:59.000]  as chief of staff says it's mandatory and do you see any of the supposed liberal websites
[2:39:59.000 --> 2:40:05.560]  talking about this do you see conservative websites no i'm i see almost no one talking about this paul
[2:40:05.560 --> 2:40:10.520]  that's what freaks me out we put out like the first article on this thursday we've been warning
[2:40:10.520 --> 2:40:17.880]  people that were getting ready for it and then no one's even covering it well the new york time
[2:40:17.880 --> 2:40:22.760]  is doing like covering yeah they're covering it saying it's good exactly all i'm seeing is positive
[2:40:22.760 --> 2:40:29.720]  reportage they say in an editorial quote this is a chance to constructively harness the idealism
[2:40:29.720 --> 2:40:34.520]  of thousands of americans eager to contribute time and energy solving nations problems a chance not
[2:40:34.520 --> 2:40:40.440]  to be missed but it's pushing the fact that the senate needs to pass it and whenever the new york
[2:40:40.440 --> 2:40:46.120]  times um and the washington post get behind something then you know it's coming from the very top
[2:40:46.120 --> 2:40:54.760]  well i mean here we are it is a national draft for everyone it they admit it's military training
[2:40:54.760 --> 2:40:59.560]  and then all these other little tattletale brigades in england's announced open spies watching all
[2:40:59.560 --> 2:41:03.560]  the citizens right out of east germany tell folks about that it's it's happening in australia
[2:41:03.560 --> 2:41:10.200]  it's happening everywhere they're just announcing it everywhere it's the british government
[2:41:10.200 --> 2:41:16.920]  um including gordon brown himself they're very proud of it came out on sunday and said that
[2:41:17.800 --> 2:41:27.160]  tens of thousands and the figure is around 60 000 british civilians and we're talking managers of
[2:41:28.520 --> 2:41:34.840]  supermarkets and people like that people who work in stores have been trained to spot
[2:41:34.840 --> 2:41:41.800]  quote terrorist and then report them to an authority and we knew we knew this was already
[2:41:42.360 --> 2:41:48.920]  um going on we knew that this was already happening because three years ago you got
[2:41:48.920 --> 2:41:53.960]  the actual flyers and newspapers and put on doorways saying watch for someone who keeps their
[2:41:53.960 --> 2:41:59.240]  desk drawer locked watch for somebody who's on the cell phone watch everyone listen to what
[2:41:59.240 --> 2:42:04.440]  everyone's saying call authorities if and it was completely broad to everyone and then big
[2:42:04.440 --> 2:42:10.200]  billboards with an all-seeing eye saying we're watching you i mean they're actually putting
[2:42:10.200 --> 2:42:18.040]  up signs saying the all-seeing eye is watching you yeah and there are no real terrorists running
[2:42:18.040 --> 2:42:24.120]  around like you know they tell us there are so the only people caught up in it are for example
[2:42:24.120 --> 2:42:30.680]  there's a story today which are posted out that um telegraph i think which was about two fishermen
[2:42:30.680 --> 2:42:37.480]  who use laser pointers to prevent ducks from becoming entangled in their fishing net
[2:42:38.200 --> 2:42:42.840]  and for pointing these lasers at these ducks to prevent them from getting caught in the net
[2:42:43.480 --> 2:42:49.800]  they were arrested by police under the terrorism act because pointing lasers is now an act of
[2:42:49.800 --> 2:42:55.160]  terrorism and they're actually interrogated for hours exactly we can't explain how bad it is
[2:42:55.160 --> 2:43:00.520]  because we live this and see hundreds of things a day paul they're arresting people for dropping
[2:43:00.520 --> 2:43:07.000]  an apple core by accident off of a table at a cafe they are arresting they've made it illegal
[2:43:07.000 --> 2:43:11.560]  to photograph or videotape police but they have millions of cameras in london alone videotaping
[2:43:11.560 --> 2:43:18.760]  us it's just it's all off the charts and it's happening in the us as well listen to this curtain
[2:43:18.760 --> 2:43:26.360]  emerald a story mark 24th give mandatory service act strips first amendment from volunteers he went
[2:43:26.360 --> 2:43:33.480]  and read uh it's from government track dot us and it says uh george miller a democrat and this
[2:43:33.480 --> 2:43:38.840]  passed the house tacked an amendment on hr 1388 that's one that's passed entitled generations
[2:43:38.840 --> 2:43:45.160]  invigorating volunteerism act to give government obama's plan to require mandatory service for
[2:43:45.160 --> 2:43:49.560]  all able young people millers and then it will prohibit organizations from attempting to influence
[2:43:49.560 --> 2:43:54.760]  legislation organize their engagement protests petitions boycotts or strikes and assist promoter
[2:43:54.760 --> 2:44:01.160]  deter union organizing so so they also gag everybody i mean my god in other words obama's
[2:44:01.160 --> 2:44:06.680]  volunteer core act passed by the house with a 321 to 105 margin and requiring the government to
[2:44:06.680 --> 2:44:14.120]  develop a plan for indentured servitude would deny millions of people the right to oppose
[2:44:14.120 --> 2:44:19.320]  and organize against government legislation of the first amendment this is close to a sedition
[2:44:19.320 --> 2:44:24.120]  act a violation of the first amendment rights and has been proposed in recent history a basic
[2:44:24.120 --> 2:44:29.000]  right as part of our natural and animal rights is to resist government our founders not only knew
[2:44:29.800 --> 2:44:33.480]  that this is a right but a responsibility this legislation begins to break down
[2:44:33.480 --> 2:44:38.520]  this significantly writes gary wood in the examiner in england so there is an article out
[2:44:38.520 --> 2:44:45.160]  of england on this paul this is insane this is insane gagging all the young people bringing
[2:44:45.160 --> 2:44:51.160]  them into brigades i've got the i've got the philadelphia daily news from five years ago where
[2:44:51.160 --> 2:44:57.160]  the subdivision of americorps secure core had the high schoolers training with m16s in gun
[2:44:57.160 --> 2:45:04.120]  confiscation checkpoints and fugitive apprehension that was in the news they are literally coming
[2:45:04.120 --> 2:45:12.680]  for us and the dumbass public doesn't know well exactly i mean obama said that it was
[2:45:12.680 --> 2:45:20.120]  his aim to cut carbon emissions by 80 percent and uh you just had you just had gordon browns
[2:45:20.120 --> 2:45:25.880]  head environmental minister say that they've got to reduce the uk population forcibly by 50 percent
[2:45:26.600 --> 2:45:32.680]  they've got to have water rationing water rationing food rationing that's the timing you just can't
[2:45:32.680 --> 2:45:37.560]  these are criminals taking over it isn't enough that they've ruled everything and sucked everything
[2:45:37.560 --> 2:45:44.600]  out with the banks i am pissed man i you know because i'm sorry go ahead the thing about it alex
[2:45:44.600 --> 2:45:50.760]  is to deceive the next step for america is what we've got in the uk because for example in america
[2:45:50.760 --> 2:45:57.080]  you've got this obama army of knocker door zombies you know knocking on a million doors that that's
[2:45:57.080 --> 2:46:02.920]  proven completely pathetic it was a total failure but in england this is where it really gets serious
[2:46:03.560 --> 2:46:10.200]  they've actually got people who are recruited into a charity that has linked to the government
[2:46:10.200 --> 2:46:15.800]  masquerade to the charity it's called common purpose and this is where the people who are
[2:46:15.800 --> 2:46:22.520]  later appointed positions of power within each city are fed the government line on how the
[2:46:22.520 --> 2:46:29.080]  city needs to be run and they're assigned positions of power and i just checked on my own city on
[2:46:29.080 --> 2:46:36.520]  who were members of this common purpose organization and literally every university every police
[2:46:36.520 --> 2:46:43.640]  department every branch of media and local government are infested with these common purpose
[2:46:43.640 --> 2:46:50.760]  members who have been recruited by this secret organization which by the way has has its origins
[2:46:50.760 --> 2:46:57.160]  in a marxist think tank with which from which tony bler got his political ideology and they're now
[2:46:57.160 --> 2:47:02.520]  all in these positions of power throughout our 50s in england and that's the stage for america
[2:47:02.520 --> 2:47:07.240]  now now now i want people to hear the magnitude and i saw the articles you posted at prison
[2:47:07.240 --> 2:47:13.320]  planet dot com on this they are creating a spy force and then they're merging it with this common
[2:47:13.320 --> 2:47:19.880]  purpose and then literally they're also the community leaders then you cross reference it
[2:47:19.880 --> 2:47:25.560]  they're also part of the spy group spying on everyone at every level that's what obama's doing
[2:47:25.560 --> 2:47:30.120]  and this is literally what the nazis the east germans and the soviets and the communist chinese
[2:47:30.120 --> 2:47:35.080]  did they are following the exact pattern it is happening now and i had an article in here from
[2:47:35.080 --> 2:47:41.320]  the associated press i can't find it now uh it's somewhere here in my crazy stack that actually
[2:47:42.120 --> 2:47:46.040]  zoom in on this folks this is just the stack of the last two days i can't even keep track of it
[2:47:46.040 --> 2:47:49.160]  tilt that camera i want folks to see on prison planet dot t what we're dealing with
[2:47:49.160 --> 2:47:57.720]  where the new 29 year old head of the state police uh in illinois is a former military captain
[2:47:57.720 --> 2:48:02.840]  and then i see this that they're they're now moving army officers out to be the heads of
[2:48:02.840 --> 2:48:08.200]  state police police chiefs everywhere the military takeover is happening right now
[2:48:10.200 --> 2:48:15.000]  i mean it's happening okay folks america is falling the republic is falling
[2:48:15.000 --> 2:48:18.920]  i've got mainstream news articles here where the supreme court today is hearing whether they're
[2:48:18.920 --> 2:48:23.880]  going to ban any movies or documentaries criticizing the government associated press paul
[2:48:23.880 --> 2:48:31.560]  paul associated press paul i mean yeah regarding the hillary clinton documentary isn't it yes
[2:48:31.560 --> 2:48:37.240]  yes i mean the ap with a straight face acts like it's normal that they're considering banning
[2:48:37.240 --> 2:48:43.080]  criticizing government claiming it's a violation of campaign finance laws and we told people the
[2:48:43.080 --> 2:48:48.280]  way russ feingold was written in 2002 that it could in free speech the way it was written
[2:48:48.280 --> 2:48:52.120]  now they're implementing it see they'll they're going to pass the draft through the senate
[2:48:52.120 --> 2:48:55.560]  and they're going to slowly people like well where where's the draft where's it happened it'll
[2:48:55.560 --> 2:48:59.240]  phase in but you've heard people calling and it's in the news they're already telling high
[2:48:59.240 --> 2:49:03.960]  schoolers oh you've got to do compulsory federal service now and it's not even a law they're just
[2:49:03.960 --> 2:49:12.200]  criminals and a serious thing related to the martial law issue which you mentioned we had
[2:49:12.200 --> 2:49:18.040]  the story from the new york county where there was some corrupt police beating up citizens
[2:49:18.040 --> 2:49:24.280]  so the majesty came forward and said let's just declare martial law just just bring the troops
[2:49:24.280 --> 2:49:29.800]  in and then he sent an email to us saying we misinterpreted his comment when in that same
[2:49:29.800 --> 2:49:35.640]  email he repeated that they were still considering it just announcing martial law and that's going
[2:49:35.640 --> 2:49:41.320]  to be a decent it's only it's only for a little while until the feds take over and then we had
[2:49:41.320 --> 2:49:46.520]  a caller earlier about how it's happening in los vegas i mean it is insane and they're doing it so
[2:49:46.520 --> 2:49:52.280]  they can steal all your pension funds that you've been investing in for 30 years and the the pre-sex
[2:49:52.280 --> 2:49:58.920]  is going to be this quote summer of rage which is all coming from the media and now we've caught
[2:49:58.920 --> 2:50:05.320]  the ford foundation and everybody else funding the riot groups yeah and the big flashpoint for that
[2:50:05.320 --> 2:50:11.800]  or at one of the big flashpoints is going to be april second in london with the um g20 meeting
[2:50:11.800 --> 2:50:15.880]  and that's where the saying is there's going to be a lot of riot there's going to be a big police
[2:50:15.880 --> 2:50:20.120]  climb down and that's exactly what they want they want and they're announcing at the g20 they're
[2:50:20.120 --> 2:50:23.480]  going to openly they've already announced they're going to officially say world government bank
[2:50:23.480 --> 2:50:28.600]  that controls the whole planet as newsweek and time have said totally ruling everyone instead
[2:50:28.600 --> 2:50:33.000]  of covering what they're doing the news is going to cover the hired thugs they bring and we've caught
[2:50:33.000 --> 2:50:39.400]  them in denver last year denver post police staging is anarchist my god it's a vortex of evil

[3:02:34.680 --> 3:02:38.440]  whatever and that's what they're doing they made millions of phone calls to congress this weekend
[3:02:38.440 --> 3:02:42.840]  to pass this and to pass all the rest of their stuff and they're going to use those millions of
[3:02:42.840 --> 3:02:48.200]  people that will call and write an email as a false organic movement to ram through as a battering
[3:02:48.200 --> 3:02:54.120]  ram to destroy the republic you have to organically the real republic speak out against this and say

[3:03:14.520 --> 3:03:19.400]  clear senate hurdle following overwhelming house passage last week the senate tonight but at 74
[3:03:19.400 --> 3:03:23.880]  to 14 on a procedural move that essentially guarantees a major expansion of the national
[3:03:23.880 --> 3:03:27.880]  service corps a cornerstone of volunteerism that dates back to the air president kennedy's they
[3:03:27.880 --> 3:03:33.960]  oh it's old it's good it's akin to the to the call of arms by president obama oh it's akin to it
[3:03:33.960 --> 3:03:38.280]  who has harkened back to those days this is not volunteerism like the peace corps which is really
[3:03:38.280 --> 3:03:43.320]  cia this is see they won't even tell people when they announce it what it is but we've got the
[3:03:43.320 --> 3:03:49.640]  bill forced compulsory service and then we've got then we've got the pentagon department of defense
[3:03:49.640 --> 3:03:57.960]  announces civilian expeditionary force and says forced conscription involuntary paul watson
[3:03:57.960 --> 3:04:06.680]  Alex i don't know if kurt mentioned this in his article but it gets worse 12th amendment to the

[3:04:13.960 --> 3:04:21.080]  attempting to influence legislation organize or engage in protest petitions boycotts or strikes
[3:04:21.080 --> 3:04:27.320]  and assist promote or deter union organizing yeah now kurt covered it so they're only allowed
[3:04:27.320 --> 3:04:31.320]  to do the government's political actions they want obama's openly saying these groups are
[3:04:31.320 --> 3:04:35.480]  political and he's already launched it but then selectively everybody else would be under
[3:04:35.480 --> 3:04:41.400]  conscription and then you can't so banning our free speech only their only their propaganda
[3:04:41.400 --> 3:04:46.200]  finish up when we come back paul i'm gonna let you go we need a master article that explains it

[3:10:03.400 --> 3:10:07.080]  tracker boxes in all cars the track and trace you a month ago then they back off and say oh we're
[3:10:07.080 --> 3:10:11.400]  not going to do it right now we've got to just expose this for what it is it's going to be hard
[3:10:11.400 --> 3:10:19.320]  for them to implement this paul Watson that we gotta fight him what's interesting about this quote
[3:10:19.320 --> 3:10:26.920]  out of the new york times article is that um senator barbara mickle right i pronounce it mickle
[3:10:26.920 --> 3:10:34.280]  ski democrat of maryland said that this and they call it an army dispersed to help to help with
[3:10:34.280 --> 3:10:40.520]  education health services and the environment an army would number about seven million people
[3:10:40.520 --> 3:10:44.760]  yeah that's what job that's what the that's what the cnnp's i interrupted i'm sorry but
[3:10:44.760 --> 3:10:49.720]  that's what the cnnp says army army army and then see see they're getting you ready for that go ahead
[3:10:50.440 --> 3:10:57.000]  seven million people now about one in every fifty germans collaborate with the starsy
[3:10:57.640 --> 3:11:07.160]  back in communist uh east germany seven million is about um one for every fifty american in fact
[3:11:07.160 --> 3:11:12.120]  is more than that and the leadership this is key for the article to put in there my friend
[3:11:12.120 --> 3:11:19.320]  the leadership of this will be taken from the fifty thousand uh infregard executives infrastructure
[3:11:19.320 --> 3:11:25.080]  protection was shoot the kill orders for martial law mainstream news mainstream news the twenty six
[3:11:25.080 --> 3:11:29.800]  thousand clergy response teams for martial law to tell their flock to turn their guns and go to the
[3:11:29.800 --> 3:11:35.240]  camps that's that's in the document you understand folks it's in the document it's in their secret
[3:11:35.240 --> 3:11:38.680]  training that we got a year and a half before it was mainstream news and we got called liars
[3:11:38.680 --> 3:11:45.640]  just like my act okay now let me expand on that folks you know i just it just it just hit me like
[3:11:45.640 --> 3:11:48.680]  a ton of ricks that they're just going to do everything this means the congress are total
[3:11:48.680 --> 3:11:53.000]  whores and will pass anything and do anything they've got bills introduced moving through the
[3:11:53.000 --> 3:11:58.440]  legislature federally to literally ban simi auto psychological testing gun ban shutting down gun
[3:11:58.440 --> 3:12:05.080]  shows they're openly announcing it uh i mean they are paul go ahead go ahead and recap what you say
[3:12:05.080 --> 3:12:11.560]  what you just said again a seven million he just announced a 13 million separate volunteer army
[3:12:12.200 --> 3:12:18.680]  go ahead yeah it's the quote from senator barbara mikulski democrat of maryland
[3:12:19.240 --> 3:12:25.960]  said that seven million people will be engaged in such work and it's called an army dispersed
[3:12:25.960 --> 3:12:31.800]  to help with education health services in the environment which would vastly enlarge the notion
[3:12:31.800 --> 3:12:39.480]  of quote community organizing the server million is about one every 50 people in the united states
[3:12:39.480 --> 3:12:45.320]  which is equivalent to what it was in star z east germany and when we remember five years ago when
[3:12:45.320 --> 3:12:50.520]  it broke and nobody could believe it when we went to the u.s uh congress and the funding for it and
[3:12:50.520 --> 3:12:57.320]  it was confirmed i didn't believe it when al martin reported it it was true they hired marcus wolf
[3:12:57.320 --> 3:13:03.080]  he died last year the former head of the star z and premacoff the former russian kgb chief
[3:13:03.080 --> 3:13:10.600]  for two years they consulted on how to do this that's right and i mean this is the this is the
[3:13:10.600 --> 3:13:16.840]  massive turnover um for people losing their jobs because of the economy they're all going to be
[3:13:16.840 --> 3:13:21.960]  hired by the government and you're gonna have the same situation that we've got in the u k
[3:13:21.960 --> 3:13:27.480]  where this common purpose group has its people in key positions of power and they can control an
[3:13:27.480 --> 3:13:32.760]  entire city and they network out to the entire country so these these people are going to be
[3:13:32.760 --> 3:13:38.200]  a lot of them are going to be primarily drawn from people who are already in positions of power
[3:13:38.200 --> 3:13:43.480]  and they're going to be in these new roles now here is the key the key to all of this
[3:13:43.480 --> 3:13:49.480]  it's how they introduce it again we know we've said this we gotta explain to everybody oh there's
[3:13:49.480 --> 3:13:54.360]  going to be troops and now they are dwi checkpoints you're not for drunks are you now there's going
[3:13:54.360 --> 3:13:58.200]  to be troops at car wrecks helping with the jaws of life you're for that oh now at a mass shooting
[3:13:58.200 --> 3:14:04.040]  in alabama regular army is going to be there that's how they're rolling that out now but when
[3:14:04.040 --> 3:14:07.640]  you read the pentagon documents it's to quote engage military operations against the american
[3:14:07.640 --> 3:14:13.000]  people now how do they roll out national service oh we're gonna help with soup kitchens for the
[3:14:13.000 --> 3:14:17.800]  homeless and then by the way we're going to train the kids with m16s how to do warrant service
[3:14:17.800 --> 3:14:22.520]  cordon and lockdown of cities is in the mainstream news and tattletale squads and everything else
[3:14:22.520 --> 3:14:27.400]  and take over your local communities and federalize them so see they introduce this in the news like
[3:14:27.400 --> 3:14:31.640]  oh it's really going to help everybody with the imploding economy when for decades they've been
[3:14:31.640 --> 3:14:37.240]  setting it up for the crises time the rioting the breakdown of society that's now being brought in go
[3:14:37.240 --> 3:14:43.880]  ahead that's right which is going to be kicked off with the g20 at the start next month what's
[3:14:43.880 --> 3:14:52.360]  weird about this then a passage is that they later cited an evangelical preacher who's the
[3:14:52.360 --> 3:14:59.480]  portrait called rick warren who's given lectures for the council on foreign relations and the
[3:14:59.480 --> 3:15:04.520]  davos group and that's another point that's another point bush spent nine billion a year
[3:15:04.520 --> 3:15:08.840]  on faith based initiative buying off the church is violating the first amendment clearly congress
[3:15:08.840 --> 3:15:13.160]  shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof
[3:15:13.160 --> 3:15:19.240]  or the press and it goes on now obama's increasing it to 13 billion and all the democrats love it go
[3:15:19.240 --> 3:15:26.120]  ahead right so this guy who performed obama's invocation and he received awards from bush as
[3:15:26.120 --> 3:15:35.480]  well he was one of the chief cheerleaders behind this national uh civilian service bill which is
[3:15:35.480 --> 3:15:43.000]  just being passed so it's it's got linked to uh evangelical elitist who have got linked to the
[3:15:43.000 --> 3:15:51.480]  cfr and uh the davos economic forum and places like that oh man uh paul you know this is a
[3:15:51.480 --> 3:15:55.720]  normal response i say this all the time you go to a ut football game i've been to many of them
[3:15:55.720 --> 3:16:01.640]  you know back in college and things and the people are yelling they're screaming they're
[3:16:01.640 --> 3:16:05.320]  painted up their faces are painted up orange or whatever the opposing team is everybody's
[3:16:05.320 --> 3:16:10.440]  screaming that's normal but you yell and scream about total end of america total takeover by
[3:16:10.440 --> 3:16:14.840]  hardcore criminals with the banks looting everything world government openly being announced
[3:16:15.880 --> 3:16:21.560]  you see they take sports and put your regular tribal mechanism to get angry and get motivated
[3:16:21.560 --> 3:16:27.640]  they take it and shunt it off into petty gladiatorial diversions and then i'm weird because i'm freaking
[3:16:27.640 --> 3:16:32.520]  out officially the country's dead we may be able to resuscitate it but i mean this means like all
[3:16:32.520 --> 3:16:36.760]  these tumblers click it means the congress is totally criminal is going to do whatever he says
[3:16:36.760 --> 3:16:43.320]  if they'll if they'll pass a national draft of the biggest ever seen in history hitler yugan style
[3:16:43.320 --> 3:16:47.960]  but then not even tell the public in the news that was what was in the bill so see there's
[3:16:47.960 --> 3:16:52.840]  that level two uh... that the congress would do this that they would cover up what it really is
[3:16:53.640 --> 3:16:57.720]  that they're putting military and all the police departments i mean paul it's off the charts
[3:16:59.000 --> 3:17:06.120]  and then you have to be forced to watch the spectacle of aboma on the cbs in the view just
[3:17:06.120 --> 3:17:11.560]  laughing about it or laughing it off about the economy whenever you see biden he's always laughing
[3:17:11.560 --> 3:17:17.480]  it off as well as just a big joke disgusting well they're criminals and the best way to rob a house
[3:17:17.480 --> 3:17:22.680]  or something is to go in dressed like your workman and just load everything in a in a moving van

[3:34:41.480 --> 3:34:47.240]  can do it here they pass upon a return it's who they are i've analyzed that as well they are going
[3:34:47.240 --> 3:34:54.520]  to fail they are assured in failing the question is how devastating is this going to be the question
[3:34:54.520 --> 3:34:59.640]  is how bad is this going to fight going to get how many of us are going to be lost and imprisoned
[3:35:03.640 --> 3:35:10.600]  i pledge myself again my name my sacred honor all of my treasure my very blood in the fight

[3:35:33.640 --> 3:35:37.720]  and those that are willing to lay down their life will gain it because when you're cowed
[3:35:38.680 --> 3:35:43.640]  when you're a coward when you lay down that makes the wolves come that encourages the criminals to
[3:35:43.640 --> 3:35:48.840]  take over society but when you're willing to fight and you're willing you know folks when i went out

[3:37:00.040 --> 3:37:05.480]  process is pure hell you know it's like my god i can't believe what i've arrived at because folks
[3:37:05.480 --> 3:37:10.200]  what i arrive at has always come true i know history i have an integrated fusion of analysis
[3:37:10.200 --> 3:37:14.520]  and data i have that gift i don't have the gift of articulating the full picture people think i have
[3:37:14.520 --> 3:37:19.560]  this gift of articulation no i don't have that gift i have the gift of understanding it and and and

[3:39:47.640 --> 3:39:53.240]  uh at the pergamon gate where where the nazis had the pergamon gate there where
[3:39:54.920 --> 3:39:58.600]  obama gave his speech and people pointed out that's where hitler gave his most
[3:39:58.600 --> 3:40:01.640]  important speeches was where obama was standing
[3:40:03.720 --> 3:40:09.160]  and he called for a new world order there now here's obama and these men are anti christ the bible
[3:40:09.160 --> 3:40:14.760]  says there are many anti christ it is a prototype that is a spirit here he is standing he chooses
[3:40:14.760 --> 3:40:21.240]  this where hitler spoke just a few feet away from him is the window and the famous things
[3:40:21.240 --> 3:40:27.480]  when hitler was elected waving at everybody now right in that building behind him is the germans
[3:40:28.040 --> 3:40:35.400]  before world war one went to babalon just south of bagdad today 30 miles south there
[3:40:35.400 --> 3:40:49.720]  they went to babalon and they dug up the turquoise blue gates of babalon and the pergamon gate
[3:40:49.720 --> 3:40:55.400]  and inside was the seat of satan in babalonian that they worship satan that's where that comes
[3:40:55.400 --> 3:41:00.520]  from the bible and the seat of satan hitler believed it gave him power and they built a big
[3:41:00.520 --> 3:41:05.480]  concrete dome over it so the air raids couldn't destroy it you can't make this up my neck holds
[3:41:05.480 --> 3:41:09.240]  up and he sort of read revelations to me and he's talking about the anti christ it says we'll
[3:41:09.240 --> 3:41:15.080]  speak from the pergamon gate in the seat of satan and so that's why hitler spoke there and then
[3:41:15.080 --> 3:41:19.640]  obama now i'm not saying he's the anti christ folks this is a secular show writers cover the facts
[3:41:19.640 --> 3:41:23.960]  and he read me the passage revelation i forgot it was maybe somebody can call in right now
[3:41:23.960 --> 3:41:33.800]  well the lines are loaded it's just sick it's totally sick
[3:41:39.720 --> 3:41:42.280]  let's play the rest of the cnn clip then i'll go to some calls here
[3:41:43.960 --> 3:41:47.800]  regardless though intellectually just from the facts of what he's setting up
[3:41:47.800 --> 3:41:51.480]  and the femacams and everything the globalist built for him and how the media is putting all
[3:41:51.480 --> 3:41:59.400]  their power behind him on ever before we are in deep trouble this is it folks go ahead and play the
[3:41:59.400 --> 3:42:05.080]  clip it's coming out of my pocketbook as michael the feminine found on long island not everybody
[3:42:05.080 --> 3:42:10.360]  is sold he's already crippled they got the economy him and the democrats
[3:42:12.280 --> 3:42:17.000]  i don't care let him throw them these volunteers insist they can take the heat he must have
[3:42:17.000 --> 3:42:22.600]  could work a bomb that put him five hundred two hundred two thousand percent that's right let him
[3:42:22.600 --> 3:42:27.320]  film it now if it works organizing for america could put its volunteers to work again on other
[3:42:27.320 --> 3:42:32.120]  white house plans given the administration a ground force that can gather signatures and work the
[3:42:32.120 --> 3:42:37.640]  phones to push the president's agenda it has all the makings of a campaign before the reelection
[3:42:37.640 --> 3:42:42.760]  campaign care not quite putting the band back together but it's close yeah exactly and they're
[3:42:42.760 --> 3:42:48.120]  certainly getting an earful depending on who's are they not gone absolutely thanks so much jim
[3:42:48.120 --> 3:42:53.480]  john i don't care i don't care let him film me exactly that guy had his opinions and he wasn't
[3:42:53.480 --> 3:42:58.280]  shy about sharing and that's for sure oh then they make fun of him okay in fact guys i'm gonna
[3:42:58.280 --> 3:43:03.000]  give you my dad's cell phone number he does surgeries on the stage an oral surgeon i don't
[3:43:03.000 --> 3:43:07.000]  know he'll be there i'm gonna give him my dad's number and i want you to give him the genesis
[3:43:07.000 --> 3:43:11.400]  backline you know that extension because i want him to briefly on air tell the story about the
[3:43:11.400 --> 3:43:19.720]  pergamon gate i'm even going to overdrive again guys come get this number for my father
[3:43:21.160 --> 3:43:24.760]  because i was like researching something when he called me i wasn't paying full attention
[3:43:25.960 --> 3:43:29.160]  that's my dad's cell phone give him the genesis backline you know that number
[3:43:29.800 --> 3:43:32.520]  guess line okay you want to write it down for if you don't know it okay
[3:43:34.360 --> 3:43:40.440]  um and and again remove from the equation whether he's the antichrist or not let's just
[3:43:40.440 --> 3:43:44.680]  securely look at it why would he go speak from the favorite spot where hitler spoke
[3:43:48.200 --> 3:43:52.120]  with the pergamon gate behind him in the seat of satan which they've got behind drapes won't
[3:43:52.120 --> 3:43:55.720]  even let the people to museum see my dad went there he shot video of it he took photos i've
[3:43:55.720 --> 3:44:02.120]  watched it in my house and they they have a display there how hitler thought he got his power from
[3:44:02.120 --> 3:44:10.920]  it and then there's obama going there to speak at the pergamon gate the answer
[3:44:13.720 --> 3:44:17.720]  all right let's go ahead and talk to jason in kentucky jason go ahead
[3:44:18.520 --> 3:44:23.880]  hey alex i'm 29 i've been married for about a year now and my wife and i are considering
[3:44:23.880 --> 3:44:28.600]  having our first child and bringing a baby into this world i know you and i have a similar age
[3:44:28.600 --> 3:44:34.440]  similar age and you have to do it do it do it you're supposed to have i know i know children
[3:44:34.440 --> 3:44:39.880]  are precious and i i do put on my faith and in christ but you talk about the new world order i know
[3:44:39.880 --> 3:44:44.120]  that a child a child growing up in today's world it's going to be far different from the one in
[3:44:44.120 --> 3:44:48.600]  which you and i grew up in let me stop you it's going to be a great blessing to grow up during
[3:44:48.600 --> 3:44:55.240]  this time and to go through these persecution and this this tribulation system you know living is
[3:44:55.240 --> 3:45:01.320]  is if you make that decision is that child's destiny so just ask god what you think you know
[3:45:01.320 --> 3:45:08.600]  you should do but there's been a baby boom there's been a baby boom since 9 11 we're supposed to
[3:45:08.600 --> 3:45:13.080]  have more children during adversity we're not supposed to cow the evil people are having kids
[3:45:13.080 --> 3:45:17.960]  go ahead as a person with with children like yourself and and having as much knowledge
[3:45:17.960 --> 3:45:21.880]  as you do about the new world order and just the demise of our country and our world as we know it
[3:45:21.880 --> 3:45:28.760]  where do you find solace or reconciliation i mean i just i'm fearful i mean well my children have
[3:45:28.760 --> 3:45:33.160]  recently been attacked we've had phone calls threatening my children and i just turned it
[3:45:33.160 --> 3:45:38.840]  over to god i said god you know i i i never asked god for anything i say your will be done
[3:45:38.840 --> 3:45:43.480]  lead god and direct me i'm not perfect just help me be a good person help me tell the truth give
[3:45:43.480 --> 3:45:49.400]  me discernment help me and i but i the one thing i broke down and asked god i said god kill me have
[3:45:49.400 --> 3:45:55.880]  him kill me have him torture me i and please take me before anything happens to my children
[3:45:55.880 --> 3:46:00.680]  but if something happens to my children that is god's will and that is the evil that's done this
[3:46:00.680 --> 3:46:07.960]  and that is just the way it is i will not give in to fear that's that's what i say to you sir go
[3:46:07.960 --> 3:46:14.600]  ahead no i think we're on the same page my father had had similar uh advice i just wanted to thank
[3:46:14.600 --> 3:46:20.120]  you live for sir you give up the life force when you decide not to have children when you when you
[3:46:20.120 --> 3:46:25.720]  counter the fear you have to you have me you know most of our ancestors were born coming across on
[3:46:25.720 --> 3:46:31.640]  ships you know in the bottom of ships filled with crap and piss and you know rats everywhere
[3:46:31.640 --> 3:46:35.640]  whether they were black slaves or white people we've gone through adversity we've been through it
[3:46:35.640 --> 3:46:41.400]  only makes us stronger okay so i mean it's your decision to make sir but just be committed to
[3:46:41.400 --> 3:46:44.600]  work three or four jobs if you have to and if you have those children don't put them in the
[3:46:44.600 --> 3:46:49.080]  government brainwashing camp thanks very much elix you guys get ahold of my dad

[3:47:17.000 --> 3:47:22.920]  tonight a point of view of iranians from iranians i used to grew up here now for 20 years i have to
[3:47:22.920 --> 3:47:27.960]  i learned to to behave like germans but um the first thing i want to say respect to you and
[3:47:27.960 --> 3:47:32.440]  to your staff you're doing a great job for the world you're doing a great job for the mankind
[3:47:32.440 --> 3:47:37.640]  for me you're not a bulldog or a shepherd uh german shepherd you're a promoter you're equal to
[3:47:37.640 --> 3:47:43.000]  promoters with your staff because you bring the direction and you bring everything back which is
[3:47:43.000 --> 3:47:48.360]  important for the good to live and to survive um first of all sir i know your time is short so i
[3:47:48.360 --> 3:47:52.760]  want to make it quick here just let me say some some stuff about the point of view of the iranians
[3:47:52.760 --> 3:47:58.840]  i just want to start quick in the 70s where the revolution iran started there was char you remember
[3:47:58.840 --> 3:48:04.680]  him he was a great person and he was at that time talking about the new world order he was faced to
[3:48:04.680 --> 3:48:09.160]  and he was one of the guys in asia who said i don't want to play this game so they kidnapped him
[3:48:09.160 --> 3:48:13.160]  and gave him cancer and then they brought in the ayatollahs and it's all staged go ahead so much
[3:48:13.160 --> 3:48:18.600]  intelligent i know that you want to do that so during these 30 years iran was prepared for these
[3:48:18.600 --> 3:48:24.920]  days this regime which is totally this regime is totally versus his his own people the people in
[3:48:24.920 --> 3:48:34.040]  iran 98 percent of the people in iran are against this regime and 98 are even maybe more people
[3:48:34.040 --> 3:48:38.040]  are the same have the same feelings like the people in the states i was a lot of times in the
[3:48:38.040 --> 3:48:42.200]  states i used to work there i used to do my internship there and it was a great time to
[3:48:42.200 --> 3:48:48.200]  talk to the people no matter it was a chinese asian black white they feel the same everywhere in the
[3:48:48.200 --> 3:48:53.560]  world the people feel the same now it's the point to to hold together we we we people with your
[3:48:53.560 --> 3:48:59.640]  house with our house of other people we have to put our hands together and from information get to
[3:48:59.640 --> 3:49:07.560]  the street and just make that nice small revolution which which well there is one video just came
[3:49:07.560 --> 3:49:11.960]  out this year which is really important for i guess for the understanding of everybody outside

[3:49:40.760 --> 3:49:46.840]  the serbs they go after anybody that isn't under their control exactly sure and you know that the
[3:49:46.840 --> 3:49:54.280]  problem which we face to is not even iran and the local the region iran because the big the big war
[3:49:54.280 --> 3:50:01.240]  is going through the elite from europe and usa united states on northern america versus the elite in
[3:50:01.240 --> 3:50:07.560]  in asia which which is on the control of russian and chinese the indians play the same thing right
[3:50:07.560 --> 3:50:12.840]  now the government like the u.s. government is telling them so the big main problem is the elite
[3:50:12.840 --> 3:50:18.040]  in china and in russia so they actually the fight is going on between them and we're just sitting
