[00:00.000 --> 00:14.120]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.120 --> 00:23.480]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones we've only got him for about 15
[00:23.480 --> 00:28.840]  minutes maybe less because of votes coming up congressman Ron Paul needs no introduction globally
[00:28.840 --> 00:35.560]  now recognized as the true leader of the Liberty movement against collectivism and corruption
[00:35.560 --> 00:43.440]  we've got a host of questions for him sir gold is exploding silver is exploding right now the
[00:43.440 --> 00:50.200]  Federal Reserve is monetizing now 70% of the debt the dollar is plunging everything you've talked
[00:50.200 --> 00:57.960]  about is beginning to unfold OPEX talking about $200 a barrel oil is this the big event you've
[00:57.960 --> 01:03.120]  been talking about that we're beginning to see come into view well it's huge and it has started
[01:03.120 --> 01:09.840]  and whether it comes about and really is identified as the big event and everybody recognizes it
[01:09.840 --> 01:14.520]  within the next 30 days or so I'm not positive but I believe it is the beginning but it's been
[01:14.520 --> 01:18.920]  going on you know you and others have been talking about commodity prices going up but
[01:18.920 --> 01:24.780]  even green span today had talked he's a we better keep an eye on this inflation you know but what
[01:24.780 --> 01:29.160]  he fails to see is so many others fail to see is inflation is when they print the money and create
[01:29.160 --> 01:33.880]  the credit out of thin air and then the price increases come afterwards we've known there's
[01:33.880 --> 01:39.040]  been inflation now we're just looking for the bad results so yes this is big and then that's
[01:39.040 --> 01:44.560]  surging gold today is a big issue today I was talking to staff but I didn't say the price of gold
[01:44.560 --> 01:48.880]  was up I said well the dollar was just further devalued you know against gold which is the
[01:48.880 --> 01:54.560]  ultimate test devaluation it's not good for anybody but when you grill Bernanke monthly in
[01:54.560 --> 02:00.160]  the banking committee he almost sometimes does laugh when you talk about inflation he acts like
[02:00.160 --> 02:06.080]  it's no issue but the head of Walmart says that inflation is going to be very serious well I think
[02:06.080 --> 02:11.160]  it's further along than we realize have you you've probably seen the stories about how the retail
[02:11.160 --> 02:15.760]  people are fooling the people for a while at least they try you know to make the bottles a little
[02:15.760 --> 02:21.880]  smaller and put 15 ounces in a bag instead of 16 ounces and you know just cutting corners but that
[02:21.880 --> 02:27.480]  is not the solution to inflation the solution to inflation is not having a federal reserve run by
[02:27.480 --> 02:33.280]  somebody like Bernanke shifting gears into the war Obama didn't even approach Congress for even
[02:33.280 --> 02:39.600]  a flimsy authorization of force I mean that's clearly impeachable but you've pointed out Bush
[02:39.600 --> 02:44.920]  did similar things but I mean shouldn't even even if Obama is a puppet congressman shouldn't we
[02:44.920 --> 02:50.320]  move for congressional hearings to talk about these new wars that are being launched well it
[02:50.320 --> 02:56.800]  would be nice but I think that we should have been doing this and demanding our that we meet our
[02:56.800 --> 03:02.040]  responsibilities in the Congress 20 30 40 years ago you know every every day it's less than less
[03:02.040 --> 03:06.720]  you know I was thinking about this government closed down you know one of the downside of this
[03:06.720 --> 03:13.440]  or at least it would come out of the truth let's say we closed the government down but and Congress
[03:13.440 --> 03:17.760]  no longer is functioning the government is not functioning so to speak but you know what
[03:17.760 --> 03:22.160]  government's going to continue to function do you think do you think the regulators aren't
[03:22.160 --> 03:25.200]  going to regulate do you think the feds not going to print money do you think they're not
[03:25.200 --> 03:31.720]  going to bail out people I mean a whole good but it would point out is that the Congress is
[03:31.720 --> 03:37.720]  truly irrelevant you know what we've known it's been irrelevant with the war issue but you know
[03:37.720 --> 03:43.520]  that would be you know a mixed blessing it would point out the truth but it would also indicate
[03:43.520 --> 03:49.760]  that we're in bad shape because Congress doesn't have much to say about what's going on Congressman
[03:49.760 --> 03:55.920]  does this not set the clearest precedent ever under globalism one world government even Fox
[03:55.920 --> 04:00.880]  News has made that point that the president then took orders from the UN in less than 48 hours
[04:00.880 --> 04:09.320]  launched the bombardment of Libya yeah and and they you know even Bush senior bragged about that
[04:09.320 --> 04:15.800]  remember he didn't want to go to Congress he came and got a token approval in 1990 and 91 you know
[04:15.800 --> 04:21.720]  for the Persian Gulf War but he says he got his orders from the UN he didn't need to go to Congress
[04:21.720 --> 04:27.400]  he eventually did but and he even used the word that was the first time I heard a president use
[04:27.400 --> 04:33.160]  the word New World Order anybody that'll use that had to be a conspiracy not but they're Bush was
[04:33.160 --> 04:37.480]  saying well this is what we need to do for the New World Order and they used that you know of course
[04:37.480 --> 04:43.720]  when they gave us the WTO oh the New World Order is marching on and the New World Order is certainly
[04:43.720 --> 04:49.160]  looking at this monetary crisis we want you know the Constitution we want sound money we want
[04:49.160 --> 04:55.480]  gold money and honest money at the same time the internationalists are planning you know for their
[04:55.480 --> 05:00.200]  international fiat car stay there let's come back with that congressman quick break when you're out
[05:00.200 --> 05:08.120]  on the road the last place you want to be is on the road but if the unfortunate happens you'll
[05:08.120 --> 05:16.200]  be glad you were wearing diamond gussets there's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue
[05:16.200 --> 05:26.520]  diamond gusset jeans they so pride in every stitch guarantee you love the way they fit
[05:26.520 --> 05:35.880]  it put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most blue diamond gussets got it
[05:37.000 --> 05:44.200]  others don't we turn jeans inside out diamond gusset jeans made in the usa with unparalleled
[05:44.200 --> 05:49.560]  quality our defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with kevlar protection so you
[05:49.560 --> 05:57.160]  could ride all day with confidence order yours at gusset dot com diamond gusset jeans got it others
[05:57.160 --> 06:07.640]  don't the genesis communications radio network proudly presents for your mind all right we've
[06:07.640 --> 06:13.480]  only got 10 minutes with him once the bell rings for the vote so we got congressman ron paul joining
[06:13.480 --> 06:18.120]  us obviously needs no introduction we were just talking to him a few minutes ago he just joined
[06:18.120 --> 06:24.440]  us we were raising this point of obama becoming the first sitting president to be uh sitting on
[06:24.440 --> 06:30.680]  the un security council as the head of it violating article one section nine uh now not even getting
[06:30.680 --> 06:36.600]  a token authorization of force a resolution from congress following un orders to launch that
[06:37.640 --> 06:42.040]  attack in less than 48 hours we were talking about this really being the biggest move yet
[06:42.040 --> 06:47.640]  for the new world order and then we were getting into congressman how we want more liberty we don't
[06:47.640 --> 06:52.280]  want dollar devaluation we want congress in control of currency and credit uh but instead
[06:52.280 --> 06:56.360]  the banksters you were mentioning they want something else they're openly calling now
[06:56.360 --> 07:01.800]  for your government and imf world bank bandcore global currency can you speak to that place yes
[07:01.800 --> 07:07.880]  and i think the evidence is uh mounting about our concerns about the dollar you know crashing
[07:08.440 --> 07:13.320]  prices are going up they've been going up but i thought it was very important today
[07:13.320 --> 07:19.960]  that bernanke you know in his sweet talk admitted that uh oh prices are going up we'll have to watch
[07:19.960 --> 07:24.360]  this very carefully in case we have to do something of course all the damage has been done over the
[07:24.360 --> 07:29.160]  last three years because they doubled a triple the money supply and that's where the problem is
[07:29.160 --> 07:35.720]  but they know what we know and what we talk about they know that uh the dollars uh that the days are
[07:35.720 --> 07:41.480]  limited and we plan and hope that we can restore constitutional money and hard money and sell
[07:41.480 --> 07:47.400]  an economic policy at the same time the crisis that's coming there was new world orders the world
[07:47.400 --> 07:54.440]  people they see it as an opportunity to move one step forward they go to war and uh they go to war
[07:54.440 --> 08:00.920]  under nato and united nations not by the congress but they want also because ultimately the big one
[08:00.920 --> 08:08.360]  is control the money so they they are they are making their plans to have a worldwide fiat currency
[08:08.360 --> 08:14.600]  the imf world bank operations but uh they they have a long way to go because that's still
[08:14.600 --> 08:20.040]  that's still is fake money it's fiat money and uh they have to defy the marketplace
[08:20.040 --> 08:24.360]  i mean they may make the attempt and they may be able to cause a lot of harm in the meantime
[08:24.360 --> 08:30.520]  but ultimately uh sound money wins out just hopefully we do our job and liberty wins out
[08:30.520 --> 08:39.640]  over the tyrant uh congressman um looking at uh what's happening around the world and uh the
[08:39.640 --> 08:46.520]  french basically invading ivory coast uh these moves into libya with the special forces advisors
[08:46.520 --> 08:51.240]  there i mean i've even seen statements out of nato and others that this is a great day for
[08:51.240 --> 09:00.360]  globalism a great day for world governance uh that now uh the un uh if if rebels in any country
[09:00.360 --> 09:07.240]  rebel the un can pick and choose and decide whether to have a resolution to basically back the rebels
[09:07.240 --> 09:13.560]  and and and bomb them i mean that's really a flimsy face in my view over neocolonialism
[09:14.200 --> 09:19.960]  yeah it's it's just a change and it's not going to work for them no matter how how hard they try
[09:19.960 --> 09:24.920]  and how many temporary military victories they have uh it's going to be a failed system i think
[09:24.920 --> 09:32.840]  obama has the worst uh worst policy conceivable first he goes in on his own under u n and then he
[09:32.840 --> 09:37.640]  uses our force to intimidate him and then he says oh the american people must not like this so i'm
[09:37.640 --> 09:43.000]  going to back off uh there's no way that we won't be blamed for everybody getting killed over there
[09:43.000 --> 09:47.960]  because it'll be our weapons and our money and if they need us we're going to go back in and already
[09:47.960 --> 09:53.240]  they do have our cia agents in there and we pay and pick the guy that lived over here for 20 years
[09:53.240 --> 09:59.080]  we've sent him over but it's messier than that they can't earn this they they think they've
[09:59.080 --> 10:03.880]  earned it out in iraq and afghanistan and and they're nowhere close to it even in iraq i think
[10:03.880 --> 10:11.080]  that's a you know a terrible mess but here we are over assisting the rebels in in libya and and
[10:11.080 --> 10:19.160]  already it's well known to al qaeda has infiltrated the rebels in libya so um they're doomed to fail
[10:19.160 --> 10:24.120]  and uh the bankruptcy will bring us to our knees this is hope we can put it back together in a lot
[10:24.120 --> 10:28.280]  better shape than we have it now well as you know congressman and because you've cited his work
[10:28.280 --> 10:33.240]  quite a bit michael shoyer the former head of the bin laden program at the cia chief analyst
[10:33.240 --> 10:39.160]  just two days ago on cnn uh he said look you guys are putting out pure theater so is hillary so is
[10:39.160 --> 10:46.360]  obama uh this is absolute garbage there is al qaeda al qaeda is the core of this group and it turns out
[10:46.360 --> 10:52.760]  that even the guy trained in virginia admits that he sent troops previously to iraq to kill our
[10:52.760 --> 10:57.960]  soldiers so we're told we got to be in pakistan looking for a hundred al qaeda total in afghanistan
[10:57.960 --> 11:03.160]  and pakistan but then you have thousands of admitted al qaeda uh in the maghreb there in north
[11:03.160 --> 11:10.600]  africa and they're now our allies this is beyond 1984 yeah it's total insanity and the one thing
[11:10.600 --> 11:15.720]  we know it it will fail but how many people are going to suffer in the meantime but it will serve
[11:15.720 --> 11:22.440]  its uh its purpose in in many ways by bringing us to our knees and uh some of them you know
[11:23.000 --> 11:27.320]  like the opportunity they don't let emergencies go to waste they take advantage of it that's why
[11:27.320 --> 11:32.440]  they think they can advance the new world order and one world government uh under these conditions
[11:33.080 --> 11:39.960]  but uh you know i think communications these days are such that our message is spreading and i hope
[11:39.960 --> 11:45.240]  we're uh going to be very good competitors with one worlders obviously even if you didn't get the
[11:45.240 --> 11:50.680]  nomination you would it would be a great educational victory to have you in those debates uh when are
[11:50.680 --> 11:55.000]  we going to be hearing an announcement congressman on whether you're going to run for president or not
[11:56.040 --> 12:00.440]  well it can't be too far off i would think in a month or so i'm going to have to make a final
[12:00.440 --> 12:06.360]  decision matter of fact i'm gonna have to make a token decision on on one debate they're inviting
[12:06.360 --> 12:14.920]  potential candidates to go to south carolina in may and uh i'm pretty close to saying that i will
[12:14.920 --> 12:21.240]  come without a commitment to what uh what i'm going to do in filing legal papers so we we're
[12:21.240 --> 12:25.640]  getting awfully close and there are just a few other things that i have to iron out personally
[12:25.640 --> 12:33.480]  to make my final decision but uh it has to come you just but but none of the other major candidates
[12:33.480 --> 12:39.480]  have made that official announcement i'm not quite sure obama that's all obama yeah obama
[12:39.480 --> 12:43.880]  he's the one that got out in front of everybody else i guess there aren't going to be any other
[12:43.880 --> 12:47.560]  candidates maybe the other republicans are intimidated maybe they think they can't beat him
[12:47.560 --> 12:53.720]  now that he's a popular war pro well you know sir you're going to win in the intellectual battle
[12:53.720 --> 12:59.560]  i mean the you know the great educational engagement you did three years ago i would guess
[12:59.560 --> 13:03.560]  is going to be dwarfed um i'm a little worried about your safety i think everybody should pray
[13:03.560 --> 13:08.280]  for you also financially support you i mean obviously uh i hope you're going to have some
[13:08.280 --> 13:14.440]  really good bodyguards uh because i believe you've got a chance to actually win sir and then you're
[13:14.440 --> 13:18.680]  going to have to publicly come out when they try to steal the nomination from you like they threaten
[13:18.680 --> 13:24.120]  reagan with if he didn't put george herbert walker bush on um congressman jesse ventura was on here
[13:24.120 --> 13:28.440]  yesterday former governor uh obviously i'm sure you've heard his announcement that if you leave
[13:28.440 --> 13:34.200]  the republican party he'd be happy to be your vp running mate uh if you run for president well is
[13:34.200 --> 13:39.960]  it going to be as a republican as of now that's mainly what i've been thinking of but uh i guess
[13:39.960 --> 13:46.120]  in life you should always keep all options open but right now i'm still a republican congressman
[13:46.120 --> 13:50.840]  and uh we did it last time as a republican and you know there's a lot of people who get
[13:51.400 --> 13:57.320]  mixed messages from that because republicans uh don't always stand for liberty as you know
[13:57.320 --> 14:06.360]  so but uh i i parties are somewhat irrelevant to me you know whether i'm an independent republican
[14:06.360 --> 14:12.120]  libertarian i think there are vehicles for delivering a message so right now i am working
[14:12.120 --> 14:18.280]  within a republican party uh congressman uh looking at the tsa are there plans on congressional
[14:18.280 --> 14:24.040]  hearings multiple states are moving to try to bar the tsa sticking their hands down people's pants
[14:24.040 --> 14:31.480]  baking people in radiation microwaves uh what are you doing to try to us uh reverse that well
[14:31.480 --> 14:36.440]  one thing is that i feed a lot of information to jason jason chavitt who's the chairman of
[14:36.440 --> 14:43.080]  that subcommittee and he is hot on that issue it's very good congressman and he is outraged over it
[14:43.080 --> 14:49.720]  as we all should be and i think if people have examples the bad examples of that always helps
[14:49.720 --> 14:55.160]  you know visuals and pictures or anything if they can either send it to him directly or to me
[14:55.160 --> 15:00.040]  i think we can make use of that as a weapon because there will be hearings on this all right in
[15:00.040 --> 15:03.880]  closing building up towards an announcement to run for president my gut tells me you're
[15:03.880 --> 15:07.800]  going to do it sir as you understand it's it's it's it's just too important to get the word out
[15:07.800 --> 15:13.560]  what can listeners and liberty supporters do to start getting their engines warmed up to give you
[15:13.560 --> 15:20.360]  the maximum support out of the gates uh when and if you make this announcement well you know in a
[15:20.360 --> 15:25.800]  couple weeks i think it's april 19th i have another little book coming out uh that that might be a
[15:25.800 --> 15:31.640]  time for an explosion of interest uh and the book does not make money from me it goes into my
[15:31.640 --> 15:38.680]  foundation so uh but it's a message it's a book talking about 50 issues dealing with and it's called
[15:38.680 --> 15:45.000]  liberty define and uh coinciding that with an announcement could be interesting even though
[15:45.000 --> 15:50.680]  those plans have not been made to do such but it's something that people could be looking at well sir
[15:50.680 --> 15:55.240]  thank you so much for spending time with us go to your vote and god bless you and godspeed thank you

[20:04.920 --> 20:22.760]  listening to the alex jones broadcasting network network well i won't back down you know in my film
[20:22.760 --> 20:28.600]  fall the republic back down one of the many things we break down is that president obama
[20:28.600 --> 20:34.200]  has brazenly violated article one section nine of the u.s constitution by shooting himself
[20:34.200 --> 20:39.080]  at the head of the u.n. security council thus becoming the first u.s president to chair the
[20:39.080 --> 20:45.400]  world body and i remember we watched it live when it happened when he took the month long
[20:45.400 --> 20:51.640]  rotation on it uh there at the u.n. Kissinger was there in rapture all these other globalists
[20:51.640 --> 20:56.440]  they went on tv after and said this is a great day for the new world order a great day for globalism
[20:56.440 --> 21:04.760]  uh that a president has now been in a dual capacity for a foreign quasi government power
[21:05.320 --> 21:08.600]  and they said three weeks ago this is a great day with the u.n resolution
[21:09.480 --> 21:17.080]  and now three weeks in a day ago and within 36 hours obama had taken u.n. orders and launched
[21:17.080 --> 21:23.080]  an attack with it without even consulting congress i mean before it was a declaration of war then it
[21:23.080 --> 21:29.240]  was the authorization of force which is a token and unconstitutional impeachable from my research
[21:29.240 --> 21:35.480]  now it's just who needs a stink in congress when you can have an emperor who takes orders from the
[21:36.280 --> 21:42.680]  u.n. itself now bruce fine if i go over his bio would take hours but he's a lawyer specializing
[21:42.680 --> 21:49.160]  in constitutional international law graduated from harvard and 72 bruce fine served as associate
[21:49.160 --> 21:54.040]  deputy attorney general from 81 to 82 as the general counsel to the federal communications
[21:54.040 --> 21:57.880]  commission under president ronald reagan fine was also top justice department official reagan
[21:57.880 --> 22:02.520]  administration uh fine has written numerous articles for the washington times slate the
[22:02.520 --> 22:06.920]  new york times he's also worked for the american enterprise institute heritage foundation analyst
[22:06.920 --> 22:12.280]  commentator american empire before the fall published by campaign for liberty uh june of last
[22:12.280 --> 22:16.920]  year other books constitutional peril the life and death struggle of our constitutional republic
[22:16.920 --> 22:26.200]  ron paul constitution and democracy ron paul is among the most notable consistent proponents of
[22:26.920 --> 22:32.200]  mr. fine's political commentary is quoted on the cover of constitutional peril saying
[22:32.200 --> 22:37.000]  bruce fine is one of the most important legal minds of our time constitutional peril is a
[22:37.000 --> 22:41.400]  must read for american leverage of liberty so when he talks we need to listen and of course
[22:41.400 --> 22:46.920]  politico and countless other publications have gone with his report g.o.p lawyer drafts obama
[22:46.920 --> 22:52.760]  impeachment uh and he's been circulating and in the halls of congress this week uh hope he's
[22:52.760 --> 22:58.200]  got his life insurance up he has a lot of courage uh certainly there's a lot of reasons to impeach him
[22:58.200 --> 23:03.880]  but a lot of republican leadership is involved in the treacherous uh constitutional malfeasance
[23:03.880 --> 23:08.120]  as well that's why they went after clinton for a sexual escapade because that was limited to just
[23:08.120 --> 23:12.920]  that event they don't want to get into missile secrets to the chinese or things like that because
[23:12.920 --> 23:18.200]  republicans were involved as well uh but bruce is is is really going after him on this and we'll
[23:18.200 --> 23:22.600]  talk about the reasons he's moving for impeachment as a top legal mind and then i've got a few other
[23:22.600 --> 23:27.640]  questions about other areas that i see uh that are impeachable but uh mr fine thank you for joining
[23:27.640 --> 23:32.440]  us well thank you for inviting me well you've got the floor tell us about your impeachment move
[23:32.440 --> 23:37.480]  well what it breaks down where folks can read the text of it and where we go from here well they can
[23:37.480 --> 23:43.480]  read the text of it it's printed now on uh political uh website and some other websites but that's the
[23:43.480 --> 23:49.400]  easiest way to find it it's got over 8 000 hits already and and just a lot about a day uh and
[23:49.400 --> 23:53.960]  but let me uh let me uh go back to the the founding you know what we're going to do to honor the
[23:53.960 --> 23:59.560]  republic i'm i'm speaking a little bit like james lotus and and sam adam that the 1765
[23:59.560 --> 24:04.520]  stand-back protest that said americans were not going to reduce themselves to vassals the king
[24:04.520 --> 24:09.320]  george the third that we the people are sovereign and that we're going to chart our own destiny we're
[24:09.320 --> 24:13.320]  not going to have one individual or group of individuals tell us what's good for us what's
[24:13.320 --> 24:18.520]  in the national interest and flout the rule of law and that's basically the uh precipice we're
[24:18.520 --> 24:26.360]  standing on today it's not 1765 in the stand-back it is prach obama stating that he can utilize our
[24:26.360 --> 24:32.840]  military offensively anytime he believes in his viewpoint it advances the national interest whatever
[24:32.840 --> 24:37.800]  he thinks that he is in libya he says it's a humanitarian interest all i can say is if that
[24:37.800 --> 24:44.120]  level of oppression justifies war unilaterally we got about 80 countries standing right behind libya
[24:44.120 --> 24:51.160]  dark things about them bob way china chechnya verma you know you name it mexico we'll be at war
[24:51.160 --> 24:55.720]  forever and we'll be spending ourselves in the further bankruptcy which we can't afford it'll
[24:55.720 --> 25:01.240]  mean secrecy it'll mean suspending habeas corpus we'll be uh put in the tensions without trials
[25:01.240 --> 25:06.360]  military commissions instead of civilian commissions we'll have uh the the greatest
[25:06.360 --> 25:11.160]  amount of invasion of privacy in the history of the united states the the transportation
[25:11.160 --> 25:15.960]  security administration you know we'll be they'll be looking up every single crevice we've got
[25:15.960 --> 25:21.640]  at the president's decree anyway the the fundamental rule of law is at stake here and the reason is
[25:21.640 --> 25:26.840]  the founding fathers were as explicit as they were in any other provisions of constitution and
[25:26.840 --> 25:31.960]  writing in the declaration of war clause which is assigned exclusively to congress over and over
[25:31.960 --> 25:35.880]  again at the constitutional convention the ratification debate the federalist papers
[25:35.880 --> 25:40.520]  explaining the constitution only congress can authorize the offensive use of warfare because
[25:40.520 --> 25:46.040]  the entire history of mankind the entire history of europe is known to the founding fathers with
[25:46.040 --> 25:51.720]  a history of executives running off and undertaking needless force to aggrandize themselves julia
[25:51.720 --> 25:56.840]  caesar politically julia this is caesar prostin the rubicon and marching on Rome that is exactly
[25:56.840 --> 26:02.920]  right so we have as great a clarity in the meaning of the war clause as we do in freedom of speech
[26:02.920 --> 26:07.720]  in the requirement that congress tax and congress spend the president can't do that unilaterally
[26:07.720 --> 26:13.960]  and yet despite that clarity the president has gone on and said not only libya any other place
[26:13.960 --> 26:19.400]  that i think is the the national interest i will use war moreover it was quite alarming yesterday
[26:19.400 --> 26:25.080]  his office of legal counsel the department of justice issued a paper that reported to justify
[26:25.080 --> 26:31.640]  constitutionally what he had done and the paper says that the president has power to go to war
[26:31.640 --> 26:37.800]  offensively unilaterally to quote support the united nation security council's credibility and
[26:37.800 --> 26:43.160]  effectiveness right not the constitution the united nation security council now the supreme
[26:43.160 --> 26:49.960]  court has held for over 50 years a treaty a treaty cannot supersede constitutional requirements
[26:49.960 --> 26:55.000]  and stipulations like only war can be authorized by congress so it doesn't matter what the united
[26:55.000 --> 27:00.520]  security council says the president can't do anything with regard to war or regard to taxes
[27:00.520 --> 27:07.080]  or regard to spending unless congress has authorized it so we basically have losing on the horizon
[27:07.080 --> 27:13.160]  an emperor exactly as you said unlimited power so whatever freedoms and liberties we enjoy
[27:13.160 --> 27:18.040]  they are the sufferance of the president he can revoke them at any time he wishes you let me go
[27:18.040 --> 27:22.680]  to the u.s security council i'll get a resolution that says we have to suppress free speech in all
[27:22.680 --> 27:27.480]  countries of the world because it's dangerous to incumbent anything like that of course these
[27:27.480 --> 27:32.360]  these hypotheticals seem a little bit strained now because our political culture wouldn't tolerate
[27:32.360 --> 27:37.240]  that but the president nevertheless will lie around like a loaded weapon it's not going to go
[27:37.240 --> 27:43.000]  away in one day or two weeks or whatever maybe obama won't like be so uh brazen and utilizing
[27:43.000 --> 27:47.560]  the absolute power of this way but what about a successor what about our own colegula rather than
[27:47.560 --> 27:52.920]  the roman colegula they're gonna come itself but they're already sir you're absolutely on target
[27:52.920 --> 27:58.680]  here uh as a top constitutional law scholar they know what they're doing but i saw that yesterday
[27:58.680 --> 28:05.560]  at whitehouse.gov reading that paper where they say the credibility of the un not the constitution
[28:05.560 --> 28:12.280]  not the law not the war powers the un but but that's double-sided this then is a direct assault
[28:12.280 --> 28:18.680]  on the power of congress and hence the the power of the american people uh and our system of checks
[28:18.680 --> 28:25.640]  and balances so to making the un credible that then uh if this precedent is allowed to be set
[28:25.640 --> 28:33.640]  uh through you know this new international model of uh governance uh then practice uh they believe
[28:34.200 --> 28:39.320]  via the international common law will bring it in setting the precedent that now the congress
[28:39.320 --> 28:55.240]  is basically ceremonial
[29:00.280 --> 29:06.120]  a very wealthy u.s citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day

[32:03.000 --> 32:08.360]  power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[32:08.360 --> 32:13.400]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[32:13.400 --> 32:19.000]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[32:19.000 --> 32:24.120]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[32:24.120 --> 32:29.400]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[32:29.400 --> 32:34.040]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from

[32:55.880 --> 33:07.560]  1-877-327-0365 coast to coast direct from austin you're listening to the alex jones broadcasting
[33:07.560 --> 33:27.240]  network network
[33:31.080 --> 33:35.880]  it's an adornment if you will it's an adornment it's a ornamentation on the wall but otherwise
[33:35.880 --> 33:39.880]  president doesn't think he can get it through congress okay just go to the un security council
[33:39.880 --> 33:45.000]  trade off his veto and where he bargains with china and russia and all these other great countries
[33:45.000 --> 33:49.880]  that means china and russia and others have more authority than our congress and remember this
[33:49.880 --> 33:56.120]  even in regards to libya obama consulted more with the aeroblie than he did with our u.s congress
[33:56.120 --> 34:01.240]  now as the aeroblie ever done paid a single tax to the united states ever done anything for it
[34:01.240 --> 34:07.000]  and he consults with the aeroblie that shows you how zany and dangerous this is it's the end of
[34:07.000 --> 34:12.920]  constitutional government as a matter of principle unbelievable uh bruce uh fine i should ask you is
[34:12.920 --> 34:18.840]  there a a website that's the best place to read your writings and find out about your books uh
[34:18.840 --> 34:24.520]  well the campaign for liberty has a lot of them on there uh but it's probably the easiest because
[34:24.520 --> 34:30.440]  i'm in the middle of building a new website now if you just google bruce fine at the in all you get
[34:30.440 --> 34:35.160]  thousands of things and that's that's a pretty good all right you've laid out the clear cut
[34:35.160 --> 34:41.000]  hundred percent case they know under international administrative law they're just practicing this
[34:41.000 --> 34:47.240]  possession is nine tenths of the law they are trampling the republic this i said this three
[34:47.240 --> 34:52.440]  weeks ago this is julia scissor crossing the rubicon i use the exact same analogy because
[34:52.440 --> 34:57.560]  that's what's happening uh we see the french under un pouring into the ivory coast backing
[34:57.560 --> 35:03.400]  rebels slaughtering innocence with machetes i mean clearly the global empire is setting the
[35:03.400 --> 35:10.760]  precedent where they finance rebels who rebel then this global empire invades its vassal supply
[35:10.760 --> 35:18.120]  hessian mercs as obama has supplied us what response are you getting uh in congress as you walk the
[35:18.120 --> 35:23.480]  halls because republicans might try to impeach him over health care or something uh but a lot of
[35:23.480 --> 35:29.080]  these republicans they like war they you know the the the military industrial complex loves to
[35:29.080 --> 35:35.720]  fill their coffers well i think there's a there's a concern and i would say it's more visceral than
[35:35.720 --> 35:41.320]  cerebral uh about what the president has done and you're right but there there are a fair number
[35:41.320 --> 35:45.480]  of freshmen who haven't quite got you know intellectually corrupted by those who have been
[35:45.480 --> 35:50.680]  in town so long that they see power in congress uh are the executive branch always good because
[35:50.680 --> 35:55.240]  they can become lobbyists afterward and make huge sums you know helping uh their clients uh
[35:56.040 --> 36:01.080]  navigate their way through uh through big government but disturbing a receptivity there's a
[36:01.080 --> 36:07.000]  recognition yeah it's it it's wrong but really what should we do about it and it's not all that
[36:07.000 --> 36:12.360]  different from watergate where i was around that is it took a while for the public's uh support and
[36:12.920 --> 36:18.520]  uh and opposition to the idea if the president does it it's automatically equal to push congress
[36:18.520 --> 36:24.280]  to have watergate hearings and ultimately the impeachment hearings leading to nixon's resignation
[36:24.280 --> 36:29.320]  and next what's going to happen in this case the members get it but unless the the populist
[36:29.320 --> 36:33.880]  writes in emails says we've got to get rid of these guys we need to have impeachment hearings
[36:33.880 --> 36:40.600]  make them come up and explain on television before the entire public yeah we can go to war
[36:40.600 --> 36:45.640]  to support the credibility of the un security council but not the united nation non united
[36:45.640 --> 36:51.480]  state constitution make them do that but that's only going to come if the population of voters
[36:51.480 --> 36:57.720]  get aroused uh we cannot expect honor uh to be prevailing in the congress you know principle
[36:57.720 --> 37:02.920]  that herons to the constitution fear fear is what will move them and fear of not getting
[37:02.920 --> 37:08.520]  elected and being criticized by their voters that's what will get them to move on uh mr fine
[37:08.520 --> 37:14.360]  constitutional um lawyers circulating articles of impeachment uh in the u.s congress hopefully
[37:14.360 --> 37:19.240]  getting some traction on this because this is the gauntlet being thrown down do you agree with me
[37:19.240 --> 37:26.440]  or with your legal gravitas correct me if i'm wrong but article one section nine dealing with
[37:26.440 --> 37:33.640]  the president uh swearing foreign oaths serving foreign powers foreign groups uh clearly that
[37:33.640 --> 37:40.360]  is a big impeachable offense if not then he could go be you know vice president or premier
[37:40.360 --> 37:46.760]  uh prime minister of russia or bangladesh for that matter and they were shaking with pleasure
[37:47.720 --> 37:53.640]  when obama uh became the head of the security council on that one month rotation never before
[37:53.640 --> 37:59.480]  had been done uh is that not an impeachable offense as well well it comes close because
[37:59.480 --> 38:03.960]  what you're pointing out is the the worry that the founding fathers had about divided
[38:03.960 --> 38:11.080]  loyalty you know they they they had seen uh that problem uh chronic in european countries
[38:11.080 --> 38:16.840]  where people would be bribed and and and be serving two masters at the same time and that's
[38:16.840 --> 38:21.400]  what that prohibition was about you've got to be loyal only to the united states you know they
[38:21.400 --> 38:26.200]  had benedict Arnold you know they they had their traders and they had great loyalists like nathan
[38:26.200 --> 38:31.960]  hail as well uh and it is very problematic at any time anyone who's serving in the united
[38:31.960 --> 38:38.920]  states government especially the president has any official uh tied to any institution that is
[38:38.920 --> 38:44.760]  somehow unanchored to the united states constitution and what you pointed out is there's only one
[38:44.760 --> 38:50.760]  oath that the president takes is to support and defend the constitution of the united states period
[38:50.760 --> 38:56.760]  he has no loyalty to anything else and that's right in article two and then we start to assume
[38:56.760 --> 39:02.600]  offices or authorities that suggest that he's loyal to a treaty or to some other institution
[39:02.600 --> 39:08.840]  the united nations or anything else that is a very very very serious problem and they know
[39:08.840 --> 39:14.840]  what they're doing i mean that was a test a trial balloon now uh he has violated his oath
[39:14.840 --> 39:19.800]  brazenly and and i think you're right this is the this is the issue to go after him on
[39:19.800 --> 39:25.640]  because it's so naked can you just briefly when you get five ten minutes with a congressman spending
[39:25.640 --> 39:30.760]  days down there trying to educate them or when you go to lunch with a group of congressmen and women
[39:32.120 --> 39:35.960]  if you're talking you know to a congressman right now and some of them do listen to this show
[39:35.960 --> 39:39.880]  we've had them on as guests and they've told us if congressmen are listening right now or state
[39:39.880 --> 39:45.560]  legislatures are listening they can put pressure citizens can put pressure on congress people
[39:45.560 --> 39:52.520]  if you had two minutes to to address congress right now what would you say i would say your war
[39:52.520 --> 39:58.360]  power is every bit is much enshrined in the text of the constitution exclusively as your
[39:58.360 --> 40:04.280]  power to tax and your power to spend if you forfeit this power you need to render it to the present
[40:04.280 --> 40:09.800]  let him go to war will you're basically setting a precedent that enabled him to steal equally
[40:09.800 --> 40:15.800]  your power to tax and your power to spend moreover the war powers perhaps most dangerous because it
[40:15.800 --> 40:21.800]  inescapably concentrates all power in the executive because of the natural patriotism of the people
[40:21.800 --> 40:27.480]  the secrecy the taxes you'll bankrupt the entire country and that is what the founding fathers
[40:27.480 --> 40:34.200]  worried more about than anything else indeed they said the most important provision in the entire
[40:34.200 --> 40:40.600]  constitution for enshrining a republic was the requirement that only congress could change us
[40:40.600 --> 40:46.680]  from a state of peace to a state of war you could not have freedom in a state of constant warfare
[40:46.680 --> 40:52.680]  and this is no time for summer soldiers and sunshine patriots in the united states but law
[40:52.680 --> 40:58.440]  is king the king is not law and if we ever forget that the republic will have surrendered to an empire
[40:58.440 --> 41:05.240]  and we will all be reduced to vassal absolutely very well said total veritas and why not just
[41:05.240 --> 41:10.680]  make george washington a king it was offered to him why not just have a king i mean why don't we
[41:10.680 --> 41:17.080]  now have you know king george the 25th uh right now you know his his great great great great great
[41:17.080 --> 41:22.760]  great you know progeny why not if we're going to have this and you've got this coterie of bureaucrats
[41:22.760 --> 41:29.240]  and internationalist and un people now running the presidency if this goes through it is certainly
[41:29.240 --> 41:36.120]  the major signpost that our republic has fallen to the new world order that is absolutely correct
[41:36.120 --> 41:41.240]  and it's part of it you know maybe you could have some platonic guardian some great enlightened
[41:41.240 --> 41:47.240]  leader yohamurabi who will do great good but there was one precept upon which this republic was founded
[41:47.240 --> 41:52.040]  there's a dignity and thrill that comes from charting your own destiny we may make errors but we
[41:52.040 --> 41:57.800]  struggle with it ourselves we are reduced to dwarf if we are giving responsibility for our own lives
[41:57.800 --> 42:03.560]  and destiny to somebody else it's a collective endeavor but we would rather be free and mature
[42:03.560 --> 42:09.560]  and accountable for our own conduct than being some kind of surf to some all-knowing omniscient
[42:09.560 --> 42:15.000]  wise man no we don't want that we don't want to be a slave we don't want to be a master either
[42:15.000 --> 42:20.360]  well it's simple pretty the philosophy that we have it is lost from this country you know we need
[42:20.360 --> 42:25.640]  we want and must decide for ourselves you don't tell us mr. obama what's good for the nation we
[42:25.640 --> 42:30.760]  are the nation we will decide through our congress whether we want to go to war you don't tell us
[42:30.760 --> 42:36.840]  okay i think i'm in love right now i gotta have you back on a routine basis because this guy is
[42:36.840 --> 42:41.720]  just when you talk to somebody who's done the same research you have times 10 it is just so
[42:41.720 --> 42:47.880]  wonderful because folks the truth will set us free when we are put in the position of slaves
[42:48.440 --> 42:53.880]  we begin to take on the manner of slaves we need the responsibility of running our republic
[42:53.880 --> 42:57.960]  not a bunch of crooks at the un stay there sir let's come back and talk about how we get this

[49:20.280 --> 49:27.160]  quick because i'm losing my son camp now i want to just run through a grab bag of laundry list of
[49:27.160 --> 49:31.080]  things we're going to the really big issues uh you were telling me during the break you didn't
[49:31.080 --> 49:35.240]  know about libya for a week you didn't know about the earthquake for a week uh tell us what it's
[49:35.240 --> 49:39.480]  like down in mexico and then your view on libya your view on the earthquake and the ongoing
[49:39.480 --> 49:44.520]  radioactive fallout well what people need to understand when i go to mexico i spend four months
[49:44.520 --> 49:49.720]  down there i live an hour from pavement and an hour from electricity my house is completely solar
[49:50.360 --> 49:56.440]  and i don't watch tv and i really i call it flushing my brain out i go down there and i live a
[49:56.440 --> 50:02.200]  wife where i only pay attention to what's within eyesight to me and it's kind of nice you know i'm
[50:02.200 --> 50:08.200]  59 years old now and it's kind of nice to do that every year because it's kind of reinvigorate you
[50:08.200 --> 50:13.960]  as you'll see i'm reinvigorated right now and when i terminally do come back to the u.s and may
[50:13.960 --> 50:19.000]  i'll be ready to roll even more but i'm getting old now so i gotta take those breaks and go out on
[50:19.000 --> 50:23.880]  the ladder occasionally and enjoy the ocean and everything you like it down there and i i really
[50:23.880 --> 50:29.960]  in fact i'll tell you this alex my uh my wife and i were considering applying for mexican citizenship
[50:30.840 --> 50:37.080]  really yeah no and that doesn't mean i'm giving up my u.s citizenship you can have dual citizenship
[50:37.080 --> 50:42.440]  but it would make a sense i go down there so often you would make life a lot easier crossing
[50:42.440 --> 50:47.960]  the border both ways if you're a citizen of both countries well it's obviously a beautiful country
[50:47.960 --> 50:53.640]  i've been all over it but it is in many cases a failed state i've read the area you're in
[50:53.640 --> 50:58.360]  is a lot safer than other areas but uh are you ever concerned about the country completely
[50:58.360 --> 51:03.480]  collapsing into bedlam well i suppose that could happen i don't know but you know maybe it needs
[51:03.480 --> 51:09.560]  somebody if i become a citizen alex that means i can run for office down there doesn't it oh see
[51:09.560 --> 51:18.360]  the governor of the bar huh well maybe president of mexico are you serious i think they love you
[51:18.360 --> 51:23.720]  down there you know i see that tongue in cheek you know you gotta remember i'm still just a
[51:23.720 --> 51:29.000]  bigger gringo of those people down there and i'm sure they want to if you were to wax someone who
[51:29.000 --> 51:35.400]  was probably born and raised there well expanding on that uh you you've been outspoken about this
[51:35.400 --> 51:40.120]  and all the experts that look at it agree if they decriminalize drugs the destabilization
[51:40.120 --> 51:46.200]  of mexico would end overnight but they don't want to decriminalize them because it just came out in
[51:46.200 --> 51:55.080]  bloomberg 376 billion in drug money laundered by wilcovia and wells fargo really no kidding well
[51:55.080 --> 52:01.720]  you know if you tie it in to what happened in afghanistan when we went in you know when the uh
[52:01.720 --> 52:07.800]  caliban went into afghanistan they set down all the poppy growers and the drug lords over there
[52:07.800 --> 52:12.520]  and you know all that money gets channeled right through laundered right through the international
[52:12.520 --> 52:18.440]  banks and maybe that played a major role in the you know the bank downturn and the bailout that
[52:18.440 --> 52:23.240]  we have to do here in the united states because they weren't getting their illegal drug money
[52:23.240 --> 52:29.400]  and of course now that the u.s. is back in there and our allies seem to be the drug dealers of
[52:29.400 --> 52:34.280]  afghanistan i guess the poppy business is up and running good again in the banks are getting
[52:34.280 --> 52:39.400]  thousands again and your book does get into some of that as well the 63 documents the government
[52:39.400 --> 52:45.800]  doesn't want you to read looking at the libya situation it turns out that al qaeda according to
[52:45.800 --> 52:51.320]  even the washington post is the core of the rebels now being armed by the west just like they armed
[52:51.320 --> 53:05.800]  them against the serbs just like the west armed them against the russians absolutely governor
[53:12.360 --> 53:16.760]  well it's like 1984 one day we're at war with them the next day we aren't but yeah we're fighting
[53:16.760 --> 53:24.360]  them in afghanistan pakistan iraq and the rebel leader even admits that he sent al qaeda to iraq
[53:24.360 --> 53:29.960]  to quote kill u.s. soldiers that was the headline last week but now he's our gallant little ally
[53:29.960 --> 53:35.080]  what do you think's happening in libya maybe the trillions in oil absolutely it's got to do with
[53:35.080 --> 53:40.840]  or alone you know if you look at what we enter into and i made this statement too i said unfortunately
[53:40.840 --> 53:46.760]  young men and women that join our military today they're not really defending us what they are
[53:46.760 --> 53:52.440]  they're the strong arm for big multinational corporations and it's been going on for years
[53:52.440 --> 53:58.280]  and years if you if you read the memoirs of general smithley butler the two-time congressional
[53:58.280 --> 54:05.080]  medal of honor winner who died in 1940 he's the best way it was way back in the teens and twenties
[54:05.080 --> 54:10.920]  that uh he the marine corps essentially worked for the united school corporation and when central
[54:10.920 --> 54:16.920]  and south american companies wouldn't cooperate they sent in the marine so uh you know it and it
[54:16.920 --> 54:23.400]  hurts me and pains me to say that being a united states veteran that uh you know it seems that our
[54:23.400 --> 54:29.640]  military doesn't really work for us they work for whatever the corporations want them to do well
[54:29.640 --> 54:35.400]  that's four years now and on the ivory coast the rebels admittedly have killed a thousand innocent
[54:35.400 --> 54:41.640]  people so the french have now invaded on the west coast of africa to back up the rebels overthrowing
[54:41.640 --> 54:46.440]  the government this looks like the start of an invasion of the african continent to me
[54:47.080 --> 54:53.160]  i don't know you know they're obviously you know they know things that they're certainly not letting
[54:53.160 --> 54:58.280]  us know and i suppose we'll have to go on another document search to try to figure out what exactly
[54:58.280 --> 55:05.640]  they are doing you know what i found unbelievable doing this book alex do you know how many documents
[55:05.640 --> 55:11.720]  the united states government last year classified top secret i know it's got to be in the hundreds
[55:11.720 --> 55:18.440]  of thousands uh by sixteen million whoa i mean that's got to be every document the government
[55:18.440 --> 55:28.440]  which out 16 million documents were classified top secret well you notice that obama promised to
[55:28.440 --> 55:33.480]  have the most transparent government ever and now he's had more secret meetings at the winehouse
[55:33.480 --> 55:38.920]  classified more stuff than even bush i'll tell you what else he's doing that is actually worse
[55:38.920 --> 55:46.200]  than bush two he's being harsher on whistleblowers than bush was eric holberg is way more harsh on
[55:46.200 --> 55:51.560]  whistleblowers than even the bush administration was and they're continuing the torture the
[55:51.560 --> 55:56.760]  secret arrest he just reauthorized the patreon act all right that is unbelievable i mean we
[55:56.760 --> 56:03.880]  covered that in the intro of my book this thing violates our constitution in a half a dozen places
[56:04.520 --> 56:11.320]  and yet why does our country now where's our supreme court here you know our country was set up
[56:11.320 --> 56:18.440]  the forefathers so that a president and a congress cannot simply pass a law and have a suit received
[56:18.440 --> 56:23.640]  the constitution and the bill rights you've got to go through groups you've got to change the
[56:24.360 --> 56:30.680]  bill rights and the constitution and that itself requires ratification by torture to the states
[56:30.680 --> 56:36.360]  none of this is being done they're violating our constitution so bad they ought to go to jail
[56:36.360 --> 56:43.880]  well i agree with you in fact we saw obama not even consult congress three weeks ago when they got
[56:43.880 --> 56:50.040]  the united nations resolution for the bombardment the so-called no-fly zone and we know us and
[56:50.040 --> 56:54.040]  british special forces have been in there the whole time since when does the president
[56:54.040 --> 56:59.160]  not even consult congress before at least bush would get some type of authorization of force
[56:59.160 --> 57:05.800]  well you know they they but even that they do after the fact you know they they passed that law way
[57:05.800 --> 57:11.400]  back in the 70s and they're violating the hell out of it what i'll tell you about alex right when
[57:11.400 --> 57:16.440]  i'm in mexico i don't even call us the united states of america anymore do you know what i
[57:16.440 --> 57:22.600]  refer to us as the fastest states of america everybody in this country thinks we're going
[57:22.600 --> 57:29.720]  to be socialists no we're not we're fascist because the basic definition of fascism is when corporations
[57:29.720 --> 57:38.520]  organize religion team up to control the government
[57:38.520 --> 57:48.520]  you
[57:50.280 --> 57:54.840]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[57:54.840 --> 57:59.960]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[57:59.960 --> 58:04.840]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[58:04.840 --> 58:10.520]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[58:10.520 --> 58:14.920]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[58:14.920 --> 58:20.200]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[58:20.200 --> 58:24.680]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power
[58:24.680 --> 58:30.040]  from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance
[58:30.040 --> 58:34.120]  and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[58:34.120 --> 58:40.280]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www dot my solar backup dot com
[58:40.280 --> 58:45.320]  that's my solar backup dot com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to my solar

[58:55.960 --> 59:01.480]  unprecedented numbers people have had to literally run for their lives folks this is steve shank with
[59:01.480 --> 59:07.000]  e-foods direct i'm not here to scare you but when disaster strikes you won't have time to think you

[59:46.840 --> 59:55.720]  eight hundred four zero nine five six three three coast to coast direct from austin you're listening
[59:55.720 --> 1:00:04.920]  to the alex jones broadcasting network network i've noticed how they're making it all about
[1:00:04.920 --> 1:00:09.400]  cutting unions and cutting spending which is great but all the economists i've interviewed
[1:00:09.400 --> 1:00:15.560]  pointed out the 1.5 quadrillion in derivatives if we don't say no to wall streets trillions of
[1:00:15.560 --> 1:00:21.560]  debt they've created that they've gotten government to sign on to and bail out then there's no way we
[1:00:21.560 --> 1:00:27.240]  could cut everything and it wouldn't even pay for a fraction of the debt that we've been signed on to
[1:00:27.240 --> 1:00:32.760]  well i i get a laugh out of it but you gotta have these republican and these new governors out there
[1:00:33.320 --> 1:00:38.680]  that are literally destroying the unions the public unions and all that stuff and laying the
[1:00:38.680 --> 1:00:46.280]  financial blame on the family what because some union asked for a dollar an hour give me a break
[1:00:46.280 --> 1:00:52.120]  and yet nobody on west street has gone to prison this mess and yet they're gonna now
[1:00:52.120 --> 1:00:58.440]  hit the blame and try to make the public believe its unions that are at first exactly and we've
[1:00:58.440 --> 1:01:04.520]  got a leg chopped off and the media is focusing in on a hangnail exactly that's a good way to
[1:01:04.520 --> 1:01:10.600]  perfect they're focusing in on a hangnail and we got our leg chopped off a good way to say it well
[1:01:11.240 --> 1:01:15.480]  but you're absolutely right governor that this is a bait and switch i'm not even saying that these
[1:01:15.480 --> 1:01:30.200]  unions some of them aren't uh you know a little bit entitled and they've done that and the middle
[1:01:30.200 --> 1:01:35.080]  class is falling apart and now the unions are basically just democratic party attack dogs
[1:01:35.080 --> 1:01:40.440]  to collect dues for them exactly and they're not even honest because i can give you a complete
[1:01:40.440 --> 1:01:46.920]  example on that and when i ran for governor's minnesota may sunk by lieutenant governor and i
[1:01:46.920 --> 1:01:52.440]  was the only two vested union members in the race and we didn't get one union endorsement
[1:01:53.960 --> 1:01:59.000]  yeah the unions right right to the democrats the unions were taken over from within a long
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:05.880]  time ago uh governor ventura let's get into not the union itself just the union leadership
[1:02:05.880 --> 1:02:12.120]  because i went to one union meeting with the rank and file so that i was there to
[1:02:12.120 --> 1:02:17.800]  endorse me and yet the leadership threw that out and the endorsement went to skip home for you
[1:02:20.120 --> 1:02:25.400]  so they've taken over the the full spectrum of the republicans and democrats and all these major
[1:02:26.360 --> 1:02:30.760]  institutions that were set up to serve the people in our interest now we've got special
[1:02:30.760 --> 1:02:34.760]  interest let's talk about your good morning america interview where you kicked off your tour
[1:02:34.760 --> 1:02:41.160]  this morning the headline is vice president ventura clarify your position i know ron paul's
[1:02:41.160 --> 1:02:45.720]  going to see this or hear this later many other congressmen are actually tuning in right now because
[1:02:45.720 --> 1:02:51.640]  they've told me they listened at lunch at the capital tell your message to ron paul uh dealing
[1:02:51.640 --> 1:02:55.880]  with the fact that you're willing to run as his vice president well wait a minute now i never said
[1:02:55.880 --> 1:03:01.800]  that i i i never said he'd be president vice president ron and i may have to flip the point
[1:03:01.800 --> 1:03:09.960]  i just said i would run with him but no i'm just having fun with you alex no in fact this book
[1:03:10.520 --> 1:03:15.800]  are 63 documents the government doesn't want you to see if you look at it i dedicated the book
[1:03:15.800 --> 1:03:23.000]  to congressman ron paul and i did that because he was the only congressman we have that had the
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:30.440]  courage to go out on the floor of the congress and and support wikileaks ron like ron paul said he
[1:03:30.440 --> 1:03:37.320]  said nobody's died from wikileaks how many people have died from the trumped up uh intelligence
[1:03:37.320 --> 1:03:43.560]  and the lying that got us into the iraq word and then he said something even more profound and that
[1:03:43.560 --> 1:03:51.080]  was this he talked about in a three country like ours when the truth equals treason we're in big
[1:03:51.080 --> 1:03:56.520]  trouble and that's what in essence they're saying if you tell the truth you're guilty of treason
[1:03:56.520 --> 1:04:05.000]  and i'll tell you if that's been prevailing sat in this nation today we are hurting and so no i just
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:10.920]  said that i if ron paul equipped the republican party because i will not run as a democrat or
[1:04:10.920 --> 1:04:17.080]  republican i want nothing to do with these parties they are the problem they are not the solution
[1:04:17.080 --> 1:04:22.360]  they're the ones that have been in control of this country like ross made who calls them calls us
[1:04:22.360 --> 1:04:28.280]  the two-party dictatorship they are the ones that have us in this mess they are the ones that have
[1:04:28.280 --> 1:04:34.840]  crossed all the debt problems everything serves to the democrats and the republicans and it's time
[1:04:34.840 --> 1:04:41.640]  to throw them out the people of this country can do a major thing and it's so easy it's as clear as
[1:04:41.640 --> 1:04:46.920]  the nose on your face the most people can't see appeal for who you can't see the force for the
[1:04:46.920 --> 1:04:55.400]  trees the next election for any republicans or democrats that would be the greatest thing that
[1:04:55.400 --> 1:05:04.120]  could happen in this country a very wealthy u.s citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness

[1:08:02.280 --> 1:08:07.480]  admit this and i've had district attorneys the one from san francisco on saying he's got officers
[1:08:07.480 --> 1:08:11.800]  in there if he sees them doing and he's going to prosecute them because a cop can't pull you over
[1:08:11.800 --> 1:08:16.600]  and stick their hands down your pants unless it's an emergency how does the ts so governor i want to
[1:08:16.600 --> 1:08:21.320]  finish up with your lawsuit but then i want to ask you what do you think of the expansion to tsa on
[1:08:21.320 --> 1:08:26.360]  the streets where you pull up to a checkpoint and they want to now drive you under radiation machines
[1:08:26.360 --> 1:08:31.640]  and they admit that that they haven't calibrated the machines and it's many times more radiation
[1:08:31.640 --> 1:08:37.320]  than they'd first said governor breaking down your lawsuit well again alex the other thing that's
[1:08:37.320 --> 1:08:42.760]  interesting about my last week and again it's only for me you know and i am stating that it is
[1:08:42.760 --> 1:08:48.680]  i pose no threat and they're for violating my fourth amendment but here's what's interesting
[1:08:48.680 --> 1:08:53.640]  certain members of our elected people and i'm not talking to the president here because he's got his
[1:08:53.640 --> 1:09:00.120]  own plane but certain members of our elected they're not they don't have to submit to this the speaker
[1:09:00.120 --> 1:09:06.760]  of the house does not have to submit to what you and i have to now i challenge and i don't
[1:09:06.760 --> 1:09:12.520]  know for sure maybe you can help me but i know nancy policy never served in the military i don't
[1:09:12.520 --> 1:09:19.720]  and i don't think bainer did either did he uh no okay holiday more patriotic than me when i gave
[1:09:19.720 --> 1:09:26.040]  six years of my life to the united states navy those two have never given their life uh put their
[1:09:26.040 --> 1:09:33.080]  life on the line in the military yet they aren't subjected to these searches but jesse ventura is
[1:09:33.080 --> 1:09:41.720]  well governor you're absolutely right but but more than just the fact that polosi and obama
[1:09:41.720 --> 1:09:50.120]  they're now computer absolutely baner and and and and as many as 50 members of the house and senate
[1:09:50.120 --> 1:09:56.360]  are now exempt they've been videotaped uh just being waved around security here's my question
[1:09:56.360 --> 1:10:04.280]  is this not bona fide two-tier class system where they are exempt from their own bureaucracy
[1:10:04.280 --> 1:10:09.960]  that they're foisting on us governor absolutely you want to hear another good one alex initially i
[1:10:09.960 --> 1:10:16.520]  was going to sue under the federal disabilities act right because because because of the meadowl
[1:10:16.520 --> 1:10:23.160]  in my body i'm disabled and that says there to accommodate my disability well what's happening
[1:10:23.160 --> 1:10:29.960]  is they're exploiting my disability get this get this one week later my attorney calls me back and
[1:10:29.960 --> 1:10:36.360]  says we can't sue under the american disabilities act and i said why not he goes it doesn't apply
[1:10:36.360 --> 1:10:44.120]  to the federal government unbelievable and i said what i said how can they pass laws to
[1:10:44.120 --> 1:10:50.440]  apply to all of us in the private sector and they don't have to abide by the very last they passed
[1:10:50.440 --> 1:10:56.200]  my attorney laughed and said there's quite a few laws like that i said i'm outraged over that we
[1:10:56.200 --> 1:11:02.840]  need to pass a law that says they can't do that but any law they pass for us the citizens the
[1:11:02.840 --> 1:11:08.760]  government likewise has to abide by it well here's an example of that obama has now handed out
[1:11:08.760 --> 1:11:14.040]  thousands of waivers to mcdonald's and their hundreds of thousands of employees alone but to
[1:11:14.040 --> 1:11:18.520]  thousands of companies that are campaign donors they get a waiver and don't have to buy health
[1:11:18.520 --> 1:11:25.000]  insurance but your hamburger a burger place or your restaurant next door you've got to buy the
[1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:31.320]  insurance that's a true form of economic discrimination here where the imperial federal government
[1:11:31.320 --> 1:11:37.960]  hands out favors to those that basically bribe them it's horrible it's horrible alex and like
[1:11:37.960 --> 1:11:48.680]  i said i would love to get on tv with john veiner and ask him blank blank how are you more patriotic than me well
[1:11:48.680 --> 1:11:56.360]  let me have this when i won mayor alex and when i won governor you said it's a title honorable
[1:11:57.400 --> 1:12:03.880]  well an honorable person should not have to be searched for a day well as american citizens
[1:12:03.880 --> 1:12:11.000]  under the fourth amendment we all are honorable and innocent until proven guilty but but but now
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:17.000]  99 percent of us are guilty until proven innocent but if you're a big shot currently in government
[1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:23.160]  you're then exempt i mean that's classical tyranny yeah and the thing that why most people are
[1:12:23.160 --> 1:12:28.680]  perturbed to this naturally is because you know like in the old days for me i could pass through
[1:12:28.680 --> 1:12:33.880]  the metal detector by simply taking off the metal out of my pockets and putting on the thing and
[1:12:33.880 --> 1:12:39.480]  you're on your way but in the case of anyone that's had prosthesis surgery like i have
[1:12:39.480 --> 1:12:44.360]  and you have metal in your body you're now discriminated against because you have to go get
[1:12:44.360 --> 1:12:51.400]  surgery so you could survive well what about the guy with the urine bag that they pulled off his body
[1:12:52.200 --> 1:12:58.200]  his his his his medical prosthesis what about i've seen it i would imagine you fly out you've
[1:12:58.200 --> 1:13:03.240]  seen it where old ladies that can't walk are made to get up out of their wheelchairs yeah i mean
[1:13:03.240 --> 1:13:11.080]  it's absurd it's utterly and you know it's interesting alex what do you know if they caught
[1:13:11.080 --> 1:13:15.640]  someone that would be headlines well you know they got the underwear bomber the u.s. government
[1:13:15.640 --> 1:13:21.320]  ordered him to be allowed on the plane yeah exactly and who and who is they caught nobody
[1:13:21.320 --> 1:13:28.440]  nobody i mean do they really think the terrorists are going to attack us in the identical same way i
[1:13:28.440 --> 1:13:34.920]  mean when i was in seal team we were trained never to do anything to white you know when you go in
[1:13:34.920 --> 1:13:41.160]  one way you come out another way if you can like in the daytime if you if you run ops at night you
[1:13:41.160 --> 1:13:47.560]  rather test fire your weapons every day that way you're not setting any pattern if you only
[1:13:47.560 --> 1:13:52.920]  test fire your weapons on the day you go out on an op well that becomes easy to predict when
[1:13:53.640 --> 1:13:59.640]  so you test fire your weapons every day that way you don't set patterns and do they really
[1:13:59.640 --> 1:14:05.240]  believe that terrorists are so stupid they try the same thing again if indeed the terrorists
[1:14:05.240 --> 1:14:11.080]  actually did it well governor does this not set the precedent though that they can put federal
[1:14:11.080 --> 1:14:18.760]  forces on highways at bus terminals at train stations at airports under this omnipresent
[1:14:18.760 --> 1:14:25.320]  threat and then we learn that amiral a locky fox news headline in october the number two in al-qaeda
[1:14:25.320 --> 1:14:31.640]  meeting secretly at the pentagon while he is on the wanted list did you see that report
[1:14:33.880 --> 1:14:37.240]  if guys put that amiral a locky dined secretly at the pentagon
[1:14:37.240 --> 1:14:42.840]  one uh report up and and and that got leaked and they confirmed it was real i mean governor you've
[1:14:42.840 --> 1:14:48.040]  talked about nine eleven explosives clearly in the towers all the evidence of that i mean more and
[1:14:48.040 --> 1:14:52.280]  more nine eleven is the pretext of destroy our liberties and you know it's interesting now we
[1:14:52.280 --> 1:14:58.520]  can segue to the book a little here alex we print the the missed report on building seven
[1:14:59.240 --> 1:15:06.680]  were they admitted they admit building seven was demoed you know have they admitted they said
[1:15:06.680 --> 1:15:13.000]  that it went in the total free file for this many seconds well but it had to be demoed because
[1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:18.840]  otherwise they're trying newton's left gravity physics the only way of building like that can
[1:15:18.840 --> 1:15:25.160]  go in the total free file which says in the missed report is perhaps is to have our resistance
[1:15:25.160 --> 1:15:32.920]  removed and the only way you can remove the resistance is for newton well you're absolutely
[1:15:32.920 --> 1:15:38.360]  right and for eight years they tried to say that there was no free fall until the videos
[1:15:38.360 --> 1:15:41.960]  forced them to prove uh you know the fact that it did fall
[1:15:41.960 --> 1:15:48.360]  they could put it on the stopwatch the building fell as fast as i would jump out of an airplane
[1:15:48.360 --> 1:15:57.880]  in free fall and the stopwatch will tell you that
[1:16:02.360 --> 1:16:06.360]  hi folks this is alex jones and i want to tell you about the silver lungs generator

[1:21:15.240 --> 1:21:31.160]  to god it's alex jones
[1:21:45.880 --> 1:21:53.720]  let me just read some of the 63 documents uh that are in this book and that are broken down i mean
[1:21:53.720 --> 1:22:00.360]  you talk about a well-written book uh i mean this thing 100 proves just how criminal the shadowy
[1:22:00.360 --> 1:22:05.640]  organizations that fletcher proudy wrote about uh and and and just how out of control and hubris
[1:22:05.640 --> 1:22:10.840]  filled they are you have our scandalous post war history that's 11 of the documents government
[1:22:10.840 --> 1:22:17.960]  military and corporate secrets uh that's another 15 documents or so shady white house another
[1:22:17.960 --> 1:22:25.320]  10 documents you've got part 4 9 11 the a think tank anticipation of 9 11 fbi knowledge of terrorist
[1:22:25.320 --> 1:22:30.760]  training at flight schools been lauten determined to strike in us bush told lied about it the pentagon
[1:22:30.760 --> 1:22:37.080]  stand down order the free fall building 7 evidence for insider stock trading uh the fbi's briefing on
[1:22:37.080 --> 1:22:42.440]  trading on the 9 11 commission then you go into the war on terror and another 13 documents there
[1:22:42.440 --> 1:22:46.600]  and then an epilogue i mean jesse i've never and i'm not just saying this because i didn't say this
[1:22:46.600 --> 1:22:51.640]  about your other books and they were excellent i've never seen a book this jam packed busting at the
[1:22:51.640 --> 1:22:59.320]  seams one of these points discredits this shadow government cog system you've got 63 of them and
[1:22:59.320 --> 1:23:04.280]  the way you put them together everybody has got to get this book and give it to doubting thomas's
[1:23:04.280 --> 1:23:10.360]  that they know uh i mean jesse you have engaged in a quantum leap with this book i mean i don't
[1:23:10.360 --> 1:23:14.600]  think anybody's ever put something together like this well you know i'm very proud of it you know
[1:23:14.600 --> 1:23:19.800]  dick russell and i worked extremely hard and really dick deserves the great credit on the research
[1:23:19.800 --> 1:23:25.000]  because alex i don't have the patience you know me i'm not going to sit down at the patience to
[1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:30.760]  research others so my partner dick russell that's why we're a great team dick is phenomenal at doing
[1:23:30.760 --> 1:23:36.600]  this research he finds the documents that he presents them to me and of course i get shocked
[1:23:36.600 --> 1:23:41.080]  when i read the documents and then of course the book is me commenting and writing about the
[1:23:41.080 --> 1:23:49.160]  documents but as i said every document is reprinted in this book so the reader doesn't have to take my
[1:23:49.160 --> 1:23:54.920]  opinion on it the reader can actually read the documents themselves this should be required
[1:23:54.920 --> 1:24:00.360]  reading in every high school every university every police chief anyone who's ever been
[1:24:00.360 --> 1:24:06.440]  in denial the way it's so well written the way it's so well blurbed and factoided on each piece
[1:24:06.440 --> 1:24:15.640]  starting at page 38 you've got operation north woods or actually document 38 and then you turn
[1:24:15.640 --> 1:24:22.120]  the page that's the u.s government plan to stage 9 11 style attacks then once you've read that document
[1:24:22.120 --> 1:24:29.400]  you get to something that we first found and dug out in 2004 and put in my film marshal law
[1:24:29.400 --> 1:24:40.280]  you have the stand down order to cheney given over to rumsfeld to change norad's preparation to shoot
[1:24:40.280 --> 1:24:45.080]  down air and aircraft you were trying to get to that governor break it down well what it is is simple
[1:24:45.080 --> 1:24:55.400]  on june 1st of 2001 up until that point all our air defense was left up to the base commanders
[1:24:55.400 --> 1:25:00.600]  that if the f a car government said we have a problem in the air the base commander could make
[1:25:00.600 --> 1:25:08.520]  the car and scramble the jets well our executive order from george bush on january or june of
[1:25:08.520 --> 1:25:16.520]  2001 rescinded that order and it stated that no planes could be scrambled with up in the air
[1:25:16.520 --> 1:25:22.440]  without without approval of the department of defense the god so in essence then you would
[1:25:22.440 --> 1:25:29.160]  have a stand down simply by donald rumsfeld not answering the phone well if you go to the records
[1:25:29.160 --> 1:25:37.080]  of 9 11 for a couple of hours no one could locate rumsfeld and cheney was hiding out of the bunker
[1:25:37.080 --> 1:25:41.880]  and lied and said he got there 45 minutes later than he had but norman panetta the head of
[1:25:41.880 --> 1:25:47.000]  transportation confirmed in five separate interviews and before congress that cheney
[1:25:47.000 --> 1:25:53.000]  was lying about being in there and saying the order still stood to basically not shoot down
[1:25:53.000 --> 1:25:59.000]  flight 77 coming into the pentagon and here is the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff order
[1:25:59.000 --> 1:26:06.040]  for the stand down from june 1st issued under the vice president's orders through rumsfeld
[1:26:06.040 --> 1:26:11.320]  and then right after 9 11 they rescinded their previous order and went back to the old shootdown
[1:26:11.320 --> 1:26:16.120]  directive where the generals didn't have to get authorization before they shot down an air and
[1:26:16.120 --> 1:26:20.600]  aircraft and they were begging that day let us shoot them down but they wouldn't give them the
[1:26:20.600 --> 1:26:27.000]  order well you know what can you say if it's as clear as the nose on your face and uh you know
[1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:32.520]  and like i said for the rest of dark read it yourself you know you can read the orders yourself
[1:26:32.520 --> 1:26:36.920]  and you'll see what happened and you know the other thing that really the document that really
[1:26:36.920 --> 1:26:47.320]  bothered me too alex is the first one the cia secret assassination manual now assassination
[1:26:47.320 --> 1:26:54.280]  is just a a nice word for first degree murder because it's preplanned and is generally politically
[1:26:54.280 --> 1:27:01.640]  inclined now how can our government have a manual a printed manual on how to commit first degree
[1:27:01.640 --> 1:27:09.480]  murder when as far as i know murder is illegal in every country in the world and yet we have a
[1:27:09.480 --> 1:27:15.400]  manual and wait till you read this thing all your viewers out there they read it i mean it tells
[1:27:15.960 --> 1:27:22.120]  you know what type of person they'll recruit to do the murders how what is mine such should be
[1:27:22.120 --> 1:27:27.800]  one of the problems you have to laugh at it like they say throwing people at the buildings or high
[1:27:27.800 --> 1:27:36.360]  places is excellent because there's so much possible denial now look i i tend to think i know it all
[1:27:36.360 --> 1:27:41.080]  but the older i get i know how much i don't know reading your book when we got it three weeks ago
[1:27:41.080 --> 1:27:45.720]  but couldn't start shipping it until uh this week i couldn't put it down i ended up staying up till
[1:27:45.720 --> 1:27:50.040]  about three in the morning uh started at about nine at night wasn't done till three in the morning
[1:27:50.040 --> 1:27:53.800]  reading the whole book and there were a lot of documents that i'd never seen i went and looked
[1:27:53.800 --> 1:28:00.360]  them up on the national archives and there they were declassified this is a literal rosetta stone
[1:28:00.360 --> 1:28:07.000]  to understand the criminal pathology of this anglo-american secret team rogue network group
[1:28:07.000 --> 1:28:10.920]  that fletcher proudy wrote about and talking to you four or five months ago the last time
[1:28:10.920 --> 1:28:16.760]  you were on governor you talked about proudy and his view into the world and i and i see a lot of
[1:28:16.760 --> 1:28:23.720]  proudies understanding overall almost like his spirit is uh hanging over this book well i hope so
[1:28:23.720 --> 1:28:29.000]  because to me fletcher proudy colonel proudy was a great american you know he served his country
[1:28:29.000 --> 1:28:35.320]  honorably and he saw that things were wrong and he wasn't afraid to come out and write about them
[1:28:35.320 --> 1:28:42.200]  even though his one book the secret team back in 72 when he initially printed that one it was censored

[1:33:26.040 --> 1:33:31.240]  their headquarters with linden larouche of larouche pack dot com linden i want to get into
[1:33:32.040 --> 1:33:39.480]  your 40 years or so of diagnosing the global banking cartel uh the rockefellers the roth
[1:33:39.480 --> 1:33:46.680]  child's their plan their stated plan uh to get the world basically into debt to get the planet
[1:33:46.680 --> 1:33:52.600]  to sign on to these fraudulent debts and then on the ashes of that to basically bring the world
[1:33:52.600 --> 1:33:57.960]  into debt slavery their own statements from the un the head of the goddard space center
[1:33:57.960 --> 1:34:03.320]  the white house science are john p holdren to have a quote post industrial world now
[1:34:03.880 --> 1:34:09.160]  when i woke up 18 19 years ago doing my own research into the globalist i discovered these
[1:34:09.160 --> 1:34:13.800]  same documents these same statements then i found later your work that had been going on for decades
[1:34:13.800 --> 1:34:22.680]  before accurately uh breaking down just exactly what their plan was a malthusian new dark age
[1:34:22.680 --> 1:34:29.160]  to shut down development to shut down any competition to their hegemonic rules so briefly sir
[1:34:29.160 --> 1:34:33.400]  for those that don't know who you are or who have heard the media describe who you are
[1:34:33.400 --> 1:34:39.800]  in your own words what is larouche a pack who is linden larouche and then let's get into our foe
[1:34:39.800 --> 1:34:46.360]  the globalist the program where we are now what their plan is and how we can counter them because
[1:34:46.360 --> 1:34:52.520]  everything you talked about 30 40 years ago we're now at that point we're now entering that prime
[1:34:52.520 --> 1:34:58.120]  zone all the other great staged events of the past were only preludes to it linden larouche
[1:34:58.120 --> 1:35:05.400]  well i was forced to frank and rosell man from the time of military service during world war two
[1:35:06.280 --> 1:35:12.040]  and i came back to the united states from overseas to find that the everything had
[1:35:12.040 --> 1:35:19.000]  changed under truman as compared to rosell now truman was a stooge actually for western
[1:35:19.000 --> 1:35:24.680]  church ruling company and during this period there's been a seesaw battle between the american
[1:35:24.680 --> 1:35:32.760]  patriot and those who prefer the british system or the british system is not what most people
[1:35:32.760 --> 1:35:38.360]  think it is it actually is a continuation of a roman empire based on the concept of
[1:35:38.360 --> 1:35:45.960]  monetarism in other words it's not the really colonies it's monetarism whereas we in our system
[1:35:46.520 --> 1:35:53.640]  establish a credit system not a monetary system our credit system which in which our dollar as
[1:35:53.640 --> 1:36:02.120]  offered was used to finance projects which were worthwhile for us and for other purposes of our
[1:36:02.120 --> 1:36:09.720]  nation whereas in europe has still been under the same old system of monetarist rule which has
[1:36:09.720 --> 1:36:16.360]  actually been a heritage of europe since the roman empire so the struggle has been and we came over
[1:36:16.360 --> 1:36:24.760]  here to establish a nation here during the beginning of the 17th century on the on the assumption that
[1:36:24.760 --> 1:36:31.400]  we had to have a separate place to bring the best of european civilization into a new territory the
[1:36:31.400 --> 1:36:39.480]  americas and to build up here a form of nation state which was opposite to the british empire
[1:36:39.480 --> 1:36:47.000]  and similar kinds of imperial ideas do we have been in a continuous war since that time since our
[1:36:47.000 --> 1:36:53.960]  revolution and even before that since 1763 we've been in a continuous war against this imperialism
[1:36:54.520 --> 1:37:01.080]  and we unfortunately when you talk about wall street or the boston banks you're talking about
[1:37:01.080 --> 1:37:07.640]  really a branch of the british empire and right now you see we're being destroyed through the
[1:37:07.640 --> 1:37:15.240]  federal reserve system which is now a creature of the british empire we are with tens of trillions
[1:37:15.240 --> 1:37:21.080]  of dollars of worthless debt these are gambling debts this is not legitimate debt isn't it isn't
[1:37:21.080 --> 1:37:28.680]  it really i mean to boil it down in layman's terms a form of neo feudalistic serfdom their entire
[1:37:28.680 --> 1:37:34.120]  stated goal if you read what the founders said if you read what other presidents this was always the
[1:37:34.120 --> 1:37:41.720]  fight it was about this monetarism where they use debt in a debt black hole system that's impossible
[1:37:41.720 --> 1:37:48.600]  to ever pay back that they create out of nothing to make us basically sharecroppers or debt slaves
[1:37:49.560 --> 1:37:54.920]  well that's that's it's true i would have a uh explanation of what this is a little more a little
[1:37:54.920 --> 1:38:00.280]  more complicated but that's essentially true okay continuing we're getting into derivatives
[1:38:00.280 --> 1:38:05.880]  uh and what happened in in 99 the end of glass steagle i mean i had many economists on at the
[1:38:05.880 --> 1:38:10.120]  time that said this is going to create hundreds of trillions in debt it's going to allow the this
[1:38:10.120 --> 1:38:14.680]  inner coterie to take over them when they implode it they're going to roll out their new global
[1:38:14.680 --> 1:38:19.480]  currency exactly that is now happening well what you what you have to look at is look at the
[1:38:19.480 --> 1:38:26.760]  assassination of john of kennedy kennedy together with Douglas macArthur and others were opposed to
[1:38:26.760 --> 1:38:32.440]  the united states being engaged in a war in indochina the thing was we are not going to fight a
[1:38:32.440 --> 1:38:39.000]  land war in asia a protracted land war in asia now the kennedy stuck stuck to this guns on this
[1:38:39.000 --> 1:38:47.080]  and the guns came after him they killed him now what his his successor was not a bad person
[1:38:47.080 --> 1:38:52.520]  but he was scared as a devil johnson and therefore johnson went along with a war
[1:38:52.520 --> 1:38:59.480]  which kennedy would have opposed had he lived then you had kennedy's brother robert was about
[1:38:59.480 --> 1:39:07.400]  to be nominated as president of our democratic ticket and he was killed and then we got a new
[1:39:07.400 --> 1:39:14.680]  process in which these british system took over we had 1968 the change in the financial system
[1:39:14.680 --> 1:39:21.560]  we had 1971 the british empire replaces the dollar and we've been losing ever since then
[1:39:21.560 --> 1:39:29.080]  we had the 68ers who were actually an anarchist fascist movement and i saw these guys first
[1:39:29.080 --> 1:39:35.160]  hand they were a fascist movement and that tendency typified by mark rodin company at
[1:39:35.160 --> 1:39:42.040]  columbia and elsewhere has taken over more and more of the control of the baby boomer generation
[1:39:42.040 --> 1:39:49.400]  and has shaped the destiny of our country so we have been corrupted in by these unrelated methods
[1:39:49.400 --> 1:39:56.520]  at the same time that in 1971 at the same time we shut down the fixed exchange rate system
[1:39:56.520 --> 1:40:02.440]  the british empire came back in with the inter alpha group under jake and ross health this inter
[1:40:02.440 --> 1:40:07.560]  alpha group is what is controlling the international monetary financial system of the world today
[1:40:09.880 --> 1:40:16.840]  what is their in game goal what are we currently witnessing you're looking at the face of pure evil
[1:40:16.840 --> 1:40:21.480]  and you might call it the british empire but you have to say what's wrong about the british
[1:40:21.480 --> 1:40:26.840]  empire you say well we know some people from britain they're not like that uh their system
[1:40:26.840 --> 1:40:32.840]  is not doesn't have to be like that but we find that the monetary element which is what's called
[1:40:32.840 --> 1:40:37.640]  the new venetian party with william of orange and for carry the thing into britain the black
[1:40:37.640 --> 1:40:45.160]  nobility the city of london in london that's part of it that's part of it continue so this
[1:40:45.160 --> 1:40:51.720]  is the problem we have is we the asian part of the world is not in bad shape politically as we
[1:40:51.720 --> 1:40:57.560]  are but the transatlantic part of the world is in terrible shape now what take the case of this
[1:40:57.560 --> 1:41:04.200]  shutting down of the government of the united states think of the implications of shutting
[1:41:04.200 --> 1:41:10.120]  down the government in a fit of peak what should be done is putting through the glass
[1:41:10.120 --> 1:41:16.520]  seagull law immediately that will get rid of the trash the tens of trillions of trash money
[1:41:16.520 --> 1:41:23.320]  of gambling debts with that money released we could restore the functioning of our states
[1:41:23.960 --> 1:41:30.760]  no and obviously the intention is is to destroy the united states by a europe-centered
[1:41:31.400 --> 1:41:36.360]  organization which is essentially what we call the british empire and that's what's happening
[1:41:36.360 --> 1:41:42.040]  we're being destroyed by an enemy which is a london-centered financial imperium
[1:41:43.240 --> 1:41:48.840]  well linden larouche again joining us right now i concur with your analysis of the historical
[1:41:48.840 --> 1:41:57.560]  facts i mean when you talk about uh the british coming in and taking over 1922 council on foreign
[1:41:57.560 --> 1:42:04.200]  relations openly infiltrating the media setting up this a system it's more of a system than you
[1:42:04.200 --> 1:42:08.040]  know so much the british themselves but that's where a lot of the power as you were saying
[1:42:08.040 --> 1:42:14.600]  is centered but also in the continent of europe and i want to go to a quote from thomas jefferson
[1:42:14.600 --> 1:42:19.400]  that i read the last hour and i want to get your take on this quote we can put that up on screen
[1:42:19.400 --> 1:42:24.600]  i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies
[1:42:24.600 --> 1:42:30.200]  if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issuance of their currency first
[1:42:30.200 --> 1:42:34.920]  by inflation then by deflation the banks and the corporations that will grow up around the banks
[1:42:34.920 --> 1:42:39.480]  will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent
[1:42:39.480 --> 1:42:44.840]  their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people
[1:42:44.840 --> 1:43:00.760]  to whom it properly belongs thomas jefferson

[1:47:23.000 --> 1:47:27.560]  we're gonna get lennon aroush's forecast on where he sees the global economy going
[1:47:27.560 --> 1:47:32.760]  what he expects the global is to pull including stage terror attacks the police state grid
[1:47:33.640 --> 1:47:40.520]  breton woods two convenes tomorrow actually this evening kicks off with george soros calling
[1:47:40.520 --> 1:47:44.120]  for an end to the dollar what does he think's really going to happen on that front because
[1:47:44.120 --> 1:47:48.760]  this british model wants to start this new band corps global currency now racing through a host
[1:47:48.760 --> 1:47:55.480]  of questions uh here mr larouge uh what is the larger strategy i'm the geopolitical brazinski
[1:47:55.480 --> 1:48:02.440]  s model from my research through the british divide and conquer uh system what is going on in
[1:48:02.440 --> 1:48:06.760]  the middle east uh we've got intel that they're planning to overthrow the monarchs as well though
[1:48:06.760 --> 1:48:12.200]  they are corrupt what's part of that larger plan or do you not agree and what do we expect to see
[1:48:12.200 --> 1:48:18.920]  as the ace in the hole moves by these people as they attempt to maneuver rush uh into this one
[1:48:18.920 --> 1:48:24.680]  world government uh the born again expanded british empire model well what you're looking at
[1:48:24.680 --> 1:48:37.240]  is the famous mythical story about the case of the zoos and prometheus that the policy of the empire
[1:48:37.240 --> 1:48:43.320]  or the imperial system in the mediterranean and spreading out for the mediterranean was always
[1:48:43.320 --> 1:48:50.280]  based on this aspect of of policy that's how it generated it the idea was is to keep the majority
[1:48:50.280 --> 1:48:57.080]  of people stupid don't educate them keep them enslaved and don't let the people become too
[1:48:57.080 --> 1:49:03.240]  numerous now as you know the world wildlife fund which is an extension of this which is of course a
[1:49:03.240 --> 1:49:10.520]  british operation says that we will reduce the world population from the order of seven billions
[1:49:10.520 --> 1:49:18.200]  of people to less than two what we're seeing now is the implementation or attempted implementation
[1:49:18.200 --> 1:49:24.760]  of that policy to reduce the world population including that proportionately of the united
[1:49:24.760 --> 1:49:32.120]  states to that level and to create such a state of chaos in the world that the empire can continue
[1:49:32.120 --> 1:49:37.720]  to rule over us that's really what is in the mind and when you look at the world wildlife fund and
[1:49:37.720 --> 1:49:44.440]  similar kinds of institutions which are the british monarchy then you see explicitly that is the
[1:49:44.440 --> 1:49:51.000]  bottom line attention and by the way everything you say is so backed up with history it was prince
[1:49:51.000 --> 1:49:57.800]  philip and his cousin prince Bernhardt who set it up it's openly eugenics arm they
[1:49:57.800 --> 1:50:03.160]  conservatively want to get rid of 60 others say 80 percent and in all these u in biological
[1:50:03.160 --> 1:50:09.560]  diversity assessments and uh in the henry kissinger state department random 200 they're
[1:50:09.560 --> 1:50:15.080]  criminal nazi like and we know the nazis were just a spinoff of their eugenics ideas started
[1:50:15.080 --> 1:50:20.280]  again in england with the galtons again it's all history they are openly declaring war on
[1:50:20.280 --> 1:50:27.720]  civilization war on humanity war on true information uh this this is a scorched earth
[1:50:27.720 --> 1:50:35.960]  policy and it's stated by them publicly they are openly admitting their treason against humanity
[1:50:35.960 --> 1:50:39.640]  what it was specifically though from your research what's happening in north africa and the middle east
[1:50:40.360 --> 1:50:44.280]  what you're seeing there is a phenomenon which is actually quite a lawful phenomenon it's called
[1:50:44.280 --> 1:50:50.360]  a mass strike in which you have a spontaneous eruption among people we're seeing this particularly
[1:50:50.360 --> 1:50:57.320]  in the generation between say 25 and 45 where the usual concentration is now it was that case in
[1:50:57.320 --> 1:51:03.720]  egypt was that in tunisia it was that which is going on the libyars being made a mess up now but
[1:51:03.720 --> 1:51:08.680]  it's what's going on in madison wisconsin it's what's going on in other parts of the united states
[1:51:08.680 --> 1:51:17.240]  you're getting a reflection of this which we saw in one form in august of 2009 now we're seeing the
[1:51:17.240 --> 1:51:24.840]  same thing extended as a more or less globally spreading mass strike movement this is spontaneous
[1:51:24.840 --> 1:51:30.760]  movement not an organized one they're they're organized elements but it's spontaneous as we
[1:51:30.760 --> 1:51:38.280]  see for example the in the united states look at teachers now the characteristic of teachers is
[1:51:38.280 --> 1:51:44.600]  they believe in children they believe in building the future for children so you find the leadership
[1:51:44.600 --> 1:51:51.720]  of opposition to the republican party crowns as well as the democratic clowns you see the
[1:51:51.720 --> 1:51:58.440]  opposition that was being led by teachers together with some of their students from the high school
[1:51:58.440 --> 1:52:07.160]  age and this is a spontaneous revolt against evil by people who do not fully understand
[1:52:07.800 --> 1:52:15.240]  what the problem is but they know that they have to stand up and fight against it mr larouge looking
[1:52:15.240 --> 1:52:21.320]  at this though uh the dominos were set up because of dollar devaluation food prices increasing in
[1:52:21.320 --> 1:52:25.880]  these third world countries where on average roughly half the population makes about two dollars a day
[1:52:25.880 --> 1:52:31.080]  or less clearly the ingredients were there through imf and world bank policy so they knew what they
[1:52:31.080 --> 1:52:37.240]  were doing but then they send in western agitators to try to tip the dominos themselves so they can
[1:52:37.240 --> 1:52:43.480]  control the outcome with mubarak uh with uh qaddafi uh with all of these people i mean clearly the
[1:52:43.480 --> 1:52:49.800]  people have a reason to be angry and to be standing up but i see the establishment trying to basically
[1:52:49.800 --> 1:52:55.400]  herd these movements towards an outcome that they want which is further destabilization of the middle
[1:52:55.400 --> 1:53:00.600]  east do you not see that there from your research not the same way i the point is you had the case
[1:53:00.600 --> 1:53:09.080]  of the french revolution 1782 the french king made a mistake and his mistake was oppressive
[1:53:09.080 --> 1:53:16.840]  for the people of france when the french monarchy refused to admit that it was being manipulated by
[1:53:16.840 --> 1:53:23.800]  the british with a wrong policy the the french people became angrier and angrier and angrier
[1:53:23.800 --> 1:53:31.560]  and they then exploded when lafayette lost his nerve in declaring it the action which he should
[1:53:31.560 --> 1:53:39.720]  have done you had the unleashing of madness the danger now is that if we do not get create order
[1:53:39.720 --> 1:53:46.600]  in society by restoring justice which is what the situation is always in these situations if we do
[1:53:46.600 --> 1:53:54.360]  not act to restore justice you will get chaos that's what we're headed to but the social engineers
[1:53:54.360 --> 1:53:59.560]  going back to the ram corporation 15 years ago openly said that we were going to be an undemocratic
[1:53:59.560 --> 1:54:03.640]  society that they were going to vertically integrate that they were going to put federalized
[1:54:03.640 --> 1:54:10.200]  police standardized training worldwide threat fusion spying centers in place that terror attacks
[1:54:10.200 --> 1:54:16.760]  would be used as the pretext to smoke screen uh this police state suppressive rollout so they
[1:54:16.760 --> 1:54:22.200]  know their policies are going to generate this then they plan to use the rebellion as a pretext
[1:54:22.200 --> 1:54:29.160]  to then openly bring out their martial law grid your take on that we could beat them but we have
[1:54:29.160 --> 1:54:37.080]  to be smart we could beat them it's just the idea of fighting a war of fighting any kind of a battle
[1:54:37.080 --> 1:54:44.840]  can be a mistake you've got to have a good strategy and i think now we're what i read as the situation
[1:54:45.400 --> 1:54:52.760]  we're on the verge of a crisis beyond belief you have two crises together on the one hand
[1:54:53.400 --> 1:55:00.520]  you have this financial monetary economic crisis on the other hand you have a wave of
[1:55:00.520 --> 1:55:08.200]  uh crises in terms of what happened in japan what happened in in uh south new zealand in christ
[1:55:08.200 --> 1:55:14.200]  church what is going to happen on the coast of all the pacific of the united states what is
[1:55:14.200 --> 1:55:20.040]  happening around the world you're going to see a pattern of earthquakes over the coming two years
[1:55:20.040 --> 1:55:28.280]  or so which beats anything in human experience today why i say that is we're in a cycle and the
[1:55:28.280 --> 1:55:36.120]  cycle is determined by our galaxy not the solar system as such we're in a 62 billion year cycle
[1:55:36.840 --> 1:55:43.000]  which is well known to people studying these matters this is a period in which the greatest rate
[1:55:43.960 --> 1:55:53.960]  of uh perturbation is likely so we're on the verge of a crisis of humanity beyond belief unless
[1:55:53.960 --> 1:56:01.240]  we take the proper action and this president is shutting down the means of detection by
[1:56:01.240 --> 1:56:07.560]  which we can be organized to defend ourselves against what's coming down with these earthquakes
[1:56:07.560 --> 1:56:15.640]  and it is beyond belief level nine earthquakes they are predictable but then you have the president
[1:56:15.640 --> 1:56:20.760]  of the united states says they are not predictable that lying president of the united states should
[1:56:20.760 --> 1:56:25.960]  be out of there mr larouge i want to expand on that because i did notice months ago you were writing
[1:56:25.960 --> 1:56:32.280]  about a increase in earthquakes and tectonic events even before what we saw unfold on the eastern
[1:56:32.280 --> 1:56:41.640]  coast of japan and i did notice two weeks before uh the march 11th event even abc news said well the
[1:56:41.640 --> 1:56:47.160]  giant moon the moon closer than it had been in 20 years doesn't just manipulate the tides of the
[1:56:47.160 --> 1:56:54.200]  oceans of the planet but also the magma uh that these floating continents are are are on top of
[1:56:54.920 --> 1:57:00.040]  and i am seeing a lot of mainline astrophysicists like pierce corbin very highly respected out of
[1:57:00.040 --> 1:57:06.120]  england he said no doubt that the solar cycle that when that earthquake happened that the 9.1 they
[1:57:06.120 --> 1:57:13.800]  now upgraded it that a solar flares ionizing radiation hit the earth two hours before coinciding
[1:57:13.800 --> 1:57:18.600]  with the quote giant moon the moon being closer than it had been in 20 years and that and that's
[1:57:18.600 --> 1:57:23.560]  what triggered it and i have read some of the astrophysicists with this larger uh a galactic
[1:57:23.560 --> 1:57:28.280]  plane that we're passing through that's a little too technical uh in my research but but undoubtedly
[1:57:28.280 --> 1:57:33.640]  the moon manipulates and some manipulates climate and tectonic and magnetic uh uh uh fields and i
[1:57:33.640 --> 1:57:39.960]  know that obama's canceled some satellites uh that uh can uh you know measure all over the world
[1:57:39.960 --> 1:57:49.640]  uh the rising and falling of tectonic event
