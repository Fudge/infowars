[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he

[00:35.600 --> 00:41.920]  out of the broadcast yesterday with a 24-hour stomach bug now my wife and other
[00:41.920 --> 00:47.360]  children have it I guess my oldest daughter brought it home from playing
[00:47.360 --> 00:52.280]  with her friends but I bailed out yesterday I appreciate Paul Watson and
[00:52.280 --> 00:59.800]  Aaron Dyke's taking over for us but I'm about 95% back and I want to thank you
[00:59.800 --> 01:04.960]  for joining us today because obviously there is so much important information I
[01:04.960 --> 01:09.760]  thought about not coming in this morning when I still felt a bit wheezy when I
[01:09.760 --> 01:16.320]  got up about 7 a.m. but I saw the news and knew that I absolutely had to come
[01:16.320 --> 01:21.320]  in here and cover all of this news and information today so we're going to be
[01:21.320 --> 01:26.520]  breaking it all down very important broadcast Max Kaiser was in Beirut
[01:26.520 --> 01:32.960]  Lebanon on Tuesday today he is in Cairo Egypt and is joining us later in the
[01:32.960 --> 01:37.120]  broadcast it may even be video Skype but whatever works better we'll be having
[01:37.120 --> 01:41.800]  him either audio or video and audio today with a report from the embattled
[01:41.800 --> 01:47.960]  North African nation of Egypt the epicenter of the turmoil we're seeing
[01:47.960 --> 01:53.080]  here's the London Telegraph headline Saudi Arabia contagion triggers Gulf
[01:53.080 --> 02:01.640]  route oil prices continuing to go up as the Arab country dumps billions more in
[02:01.640 --> 02:08.680]  welfare in emergency welfare to the public trying to stem riots they've
[02:08.680 --> 02:14.120]  also sent tanks to Bahrain nearby country to Saudi Arabia we have the Wall
[02:14.120 --> 02:19.520]  Street Journal echoing what Porter Stansbury and end of America 3.com has
[02:19.520 --> 02:24.240]  been covering why the dollars rain is near an end for decades the dollar has
[02:24.240 --> 02:31.120]  served as the world's main reserve currency but argues Barry I can green it
[02:31.120 --> 02:34.640]  will soon have to share that role here's why and what it will mean for
[02:34.640 --> 02:39.480]  international markets and companies what will it mean for American consumers
[02:39.480 --> 02:44.760]  and purchasers what will it mean for people on fixed incomes I read this
[02:44.760 --> 02:49.280]  article they don't really hit the main issue of the fact that the dollar will
[02:49.280 --> 02:55.640]  then accelerate is the key word it's hyper inflation curve once the other
[02:55.640 --> 02:59.680]  shoe drops that's the big issue here not so much what's going to happen in
[02:59.680 --> 03:07.920]  markets around the world and also we have reports dealing with jobless claims
[03:07.920 --> 03:13.720]  what's happening in China with their currency that is all coming up today I
[03:13.720 --> 03:20.560]  had about an hour and a half talk with Charlie Sheen last night boy if these
[03:20.560 --> 03:25.720]  hills could talk but I won't be talking about it but it does look like there's a
[03:25.720 --> 03:28.760]  light at the end of the tunnel in fact what what I'll do is you guys remind me
[03:28.760 --> 03:33.520]  make me do this at 1 30 we got 30 minutes left in the broadcast I'll spend
[03:33.520 --> 03:37.760]  five minutes on what I can tell you about Charlie Sheen I've got to think
[03:37.760 --> 03:41.000]  about it he didn't tell me not to talk about the things he told me but I just
[03:41.000 --> 03:45.480]  he talks to me because I never talk about it but so much is going on if I
[03:45.480 --> 03:49.040]  can talk about it to try to help Charlie and let folks know where he is
[03:49.040 --> 03:53.880]  mentally and economically and we're two and a half men's going obviously we are
[03:53.880 --> 03:58.040]  the epicenter of what happened with Charlie Sheen starting seven days ago
[03:58.040 --> 04:03.200]  last Thursday here on the broadcast I was blindsided by it just like you were
[04:03.200 --> 04:07.160]  and now it is still the biggest story not in the United States but worldwide
[04:07.160 --> 04:12.600]  bigger than the economic meltdown that we are now going deeper into and
[04:12.600 --> 04:16.680]  obviously I don't think that should be the case but it is the case and Charlie
[04:16.680 --> 04:20.480]  didn't ask for any of this to happen he just was tired of being harassed and
[04:20.480 --> 04:25.520]  suppressed and quote the AA cult but I will give you some tidbits of news
[04:25.520 --> 04:29.560]  mainly because the mainstream media keeps calling here in droves asking me
[04:29.560 --> 04:33.200]  questions are asking for Charlie's number and I'm not giving it to him but
[04:33.200 --> 04:36.480]  if the mainstream media and those obsessed with these things want to hear
[04:36.480 --> 04:40.040]  about it I'll spend five minutes on it at 130 central standard time we come out
[04:40.040 --> 04:47.560]  of break today obviously this is turned into some good things millions and
[04:47.560 --> 04:51.320]  millions of people who've never heard of the Alex Jones show are finding it and
[04:51.320 --> 04:58.440]  our numbers across the board are off the charts right now so certainly a lot of
[04:58.440 --> 04:59.880]  people are learning about the New World War
[04:59.880 --> 05:02.920]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the

[06:04.960 --> 06:10.040]  2009 the millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree perhaps a
[06:10.040 --> 06:13.400]  recession ended for the bankers and government employees but for the rest
[06:13.400 --> 06:17.040]  of us things seem to be getting worse gold and silver haven't heard the news

[08:25.680 --> 08:31.360]  Cairo Egypt on all the things that he's witnessing unfolding there in other
[08:31.360 --> 08:37.760]  news first call for impeachment by member of Congress absolutely Trent
[08:37.760 --> 08:44.280]  Franks tells blog citing abandonment of the d.o.m.a. law Republican congressman
[08:44.280 --> 08:49.400]  has told a left-leaning blog that there is a collective support he would favor
[08:49.400 --> 08:53.480]  the impeachment of Barack Obama over his decision to stop defending the federal
[08:53.480 --> 08:59.320]  defense of marriage act Scott keys of think progress dot org as us representative
[08:59.320 --> 09:05.320]  Trent Franks of Arizona a Republican I know Duke Enrich has come out and said
[09:05.320 --> 09:09.640]  that if they don't reverse course here we ought to be talking about possibly
[09:09.640 --> 09:14.600]  impeaching either Attorney General Eric Holder or even President Obama to try to
[09:14.600 --> 09:18.800]  get them to reverse course do you think that is something you would support and
[09:18.800 --> 09:25.720]  the congressman said yes so we have that here Hillary Clinton told Congress on
[09:25.720 --> 09:30.440]  US foreign policy priority committee yesterday that quote we're losing the
[09:30.440 --> 09:34.680]  info war that is the globalist that have hijacked this nation and much of the
[09:34.680 --> 09:39.600]  rest of the world she used the term info war saying no one believes the US
[09:39.600 --> 09:46.640]  media anymore that's right the only way you can hurt someone is by endorsing
[09:46.640 --> 09:50.960]  them Hillary that's what I told Politico last year about Rand Paul when they
[09:50.960 --> 09:55.760]  were trying to destroy him in the media with lies I said don't you get it the
[09:55.760 --> 10:01.200]  only way the mainstream media can defeat Rand Paul is by endorsing him when
[10:01.200 --> 10:07.400]  you attack us you only validate what we're doing because you are completely
[10:07.400 --> 10:11.680]  and totally discredited I want to play that clip of Hillary coming up a little
[10:11.680 --> 10:17.520]  bit later also continuing here top Republicans are shying away from
[10:17.520 --> 10:22.320]  presidential bids more prominent Republicans have taken themselves out
[10:22.320 --> 10:26.200]  of contention for 2012 US presidential race that officially joined the contest
[10:26.200 --> 10:30.320]  to challenge Barack Obama and we'll talk more about why they say that that is
[10:30.320 --> 10:35.920]  happening continuing here the Wisconsin stalemate could drag on for months the
[10:35.920 --> 10:40.880]  Associated Press is reporting that's just some of the news that we're going to be
[10:40.880 --> 10:47.240]  going over on that front and of course the really big news is on the economic
[10:47.240 --> 10:54.440]  front here today Wall Street Journal why the dollars rain is near an end and they
[10:54.440 --> 10:59.280]  don't really talk about what that means to the American people they talk about
[10:59.280 --> 11:02.840]  how it will affect markets they're talking about it like it's no big deal
[11:02.840 --> 11:06.760]  and not a bad thing and they don't really talk about what's going to be
[11:06.760 --> 11:12.200]  replacing it well the global SDR bancourt digital currency that the private
[11:12.200 --> 11:18.640]  Ponzi scheme operating banking families will now have backed up by our tax
[11:18.640 --> 11:23.320]  money and the global carbon tax so that's coming up here is another report
[11:23.320 --> 11:27.680]  mirroring the statements in the Wall Street Journal from Time magazine our
[11:27.680 --> 11:35.680]  America's best days behind us that calls up a line for Merle Haggard I wish your
[11:35.680 --> 11:42.160]  buck was still silver it was back when the country was strong back before Elvis
[11:42.160 --> 11:48.600]  and the Vietnam War came along before the Beatles and yesterday so they're
[11:48.600 --> 11:53.400]  telling us America is done it's a lie we could end this globalist dictatorship
[11:53.400 --> 11:58.840]  anytime we wake up and recognize that globalism has deindustrialized this
[11:58.840 --> 12:04.480]  country that globalism has been a cancer on our Republic continuing with the
[12:04.480 --> 12:10.320]  currency issues Reuters reports China's aim is to settle nationwide trade in
[12:10.320 --> 12:18.040]  Yon by 2011 moving to the point of foreign governments will not be able to
[12:18.040 --> 12:23.200]  basically come into China and buy goods in dollars see that's what it means to
[12:23.200 --> 12:27.280]  have an end to the world reserve currency and so we won't have any industry
[12:27.280 --> 12:32.800]  left we won't have any relieving service left all we'll have is propaganda that's
[12:32.800 --> 12:36.040]  generated out of the mainstream media in this country that's discredited and
[12:36.040 --> 12:40.120]  worthless no one wants to buy it of that anymore that's a good thing the
[12:40.120 --> 12:43.880]  globalist have basically sucked us dry and used our name to run their
[12:43.880 --> 12:49.080]  operations and driven us into the dirt but we can wake up and rebuke them and
[12:49.080 --> 12:53.280]  tell them get out of our lives and stand up against them any day we want or we
[12:53.280 --> 12:58.520]  can continue to be just diverted and distracted by the false left right
[12:58.520 --> 13:04.160]  distraction airy paradigm that the system is using so successfully still
[13:04.160 --> 13:09.800]  against the population of this country and the planet but China aims to settle
[13:09.800 --> 13:15.960]  nationwide trade in Yon this year so the move towards completely decoupling the
[13:15.960 --> 13:22.560]  dollar from World Reserve currency status is now reaching a fever pace
[13:22.560 --> 13:31.840]  also Bloomberg reports announced u.s. Job cuts rose 20% from a year ago and it
[13:31.840 --> 13:35.040]  says employers in the u.s. announced more job cuts in February than the last
[13:35.040 --> 13:41.880]  month of this same month last year led by surge at government agencies plan
[13:41.880 --> 13:49.520]  firings increased 20% to 50,702 last month from February 2010 the first year
[13:49.520 --> 13:54.640]  over year gained since 2009 according to report today from Chicago based
[13:54.640 --> 13:58.280]  challenger gray and Christmas Inc. announcements at federal state local
[13:58.280 --> 14:09.160]  government's offices almost tripled from last year so job cut slowed from last
[14:09.160 --> 14:16.400]  year but only because of government hiring only government is growing now
[14:16.400 --> 14:19.680]  some local governments are actually cutting massively and the police and
[14:19.680 --> 14:26.000]  sheriff's departments are openly stating oh hey guess what we are now going to not
[14:26.000 --> 14:33.360]  really respond to crime we're now just a revenue generation system so employers
[14:33.360 --> 14:38.040]  in u.s. announced more job cuts in February than the same month last year
[14:38.040 --> 14:42.640]  led by a surge at government agencies very confusing article because it says
[14:42.640 --> 14:45.680]  they hired more but they also let off more reading this it's hard to even
[14:45.680 --> 14:49.000]  understand what they're saying more job cuts at federal level expected in the
[14:49.000 --> 14:56.080]  months ahead as pressure amounts to cut costs and rain in soaring national debt
[14:57.240 --> 15:01.920]  very strange article I can't even understand what it's saying really here's
[15:01.920 --> 15:06.840]  some interesting science news tractor beam is possible with lasers says
[15:06.840 --> 15:12.320]  scientist a laser can act as a tractor beam drawing small objects back towards
[15:12.320 --> 15:17.360]  laser source scientists have said that's bbc here's another interesting
[15:17.360 --> 15:24.680]  article in the science category and this is from space.com Air Force x37b
[15:24.680 --> 15:31.240]  space plane launching on secret mission tomorrow its second mission of course
[15:31.240 --> 15:36.200]  more than 80% of shuttle and overall NASA missions are secret and our military
[15:36.200 --> 15:39.680]  and most of it has nothing to do with defense it's about offensive weapon
[15:39.680 --> 15:44.760]  systems and it's about surveilling people here in the United States just like it
[15:44.760 --> 15:52.280]  came out a few months ago what in January that the u.s. slash EU German
[15:52.280 --> 15:57.760]  combine to launch quote global warming monitoring satellites had nothing to do
[15:57.760 --> 16:04.960]  with it that it was all infrared systems to spy on the people of the west and
[16:04.960 --> 16:09.960]  once they get your infrared signal on the ground they can then tell who you
[16:09.960 --> 16:14.360]  are from space biometrically from the heat signature of your shoulders and
[16:14.360 --> 16:18.040]  the top of your head every time I talk about that I get emails going they
[16:18.040 --> 16:21.800]  can't see your face from space unless you're looking up that's not what I just
[16:21.800 --> 16:25.680]  said this is what Bob Woodward three years ago wrote about being the secret
[16:25.680 --> 16:32.080]  weapon in Iraq they get a heat resonance scan off of you off of off of a heat
[16:32.080 --> 16:38.280]  scanning camera infrared camera on the street they attach that then to your
[16:38.280 --> 16:43.000]  license plate to confirm your identity they can also run it through a face
[16:43.000 --> 16:47.440]  scan that the camera also runs then connect that face scan and sync it up
[16:47.440 --> 16:52.800]  for ID purposes with the heat resonance scan and then track you by space
[16:52.800 --> 17:00.440]  everywhere you go okay continuing along those lines we're going to get more
[17:00.440 --> 17:07.920]  into that later in the broadcast today but I do want to continue where we left
[17:07.920 --> 17:11.160]  off yesterday before I had to bail out because of a little stomach bug that
[17:11.160 --> 17:17.840]  developed while I was on air certainly couldn't be here vomiting live I'm
[17:17.840 --> 17:22.560]  always vomiting out information pun intended but had to bail out yesterday
[17:22.560 --> 17:27.080]  so I want to come back where we left off with your phone calls we'll be taking
[17:27.080 --> 17:31.120]  your phone calls throughout the broadcast today the toll-free number to
[17:31.120 --> 17:41.640]  join us is 1-800-259-9231-1800-2599-9231 and I'd love to hear from folks if you can
[17:41.640 --> 17:45.320]  get through from the Middle East on what you're seeing happen there Saudi
[17:45.320 --> 17:51.320]  Arabia Yemen Egypt Libya of course they've cut most the phone lines there
[17:51.320 --> 17:58.200]  800-259-931 what do you think of these open announcements of ending the dollar
[17:58.200 --> 18:04.400]  as the World Reserve currency I mean now it's not a question of if but when
[18:04.400 --> 18:07.840]  what are you doing to get prepared are you warning other people are your
[18:07.840 --> 18:12.640]  neighbors concerned about this or are they only concerned with Justin Bieber
[18:12.640 --> 18:17.480]  the Charlie Sheen scandal and all the rest of things that are happening that
[18:17.480 --> 18:22.880]  the media basically uses as a distraction and an overall diversion and
[18:22.880 --> 18:25.880]  if you're single Alex you're being a hypocrite you always criticize all the
[18:25.880 --> 18:30.080]  succession with Hollywood and stuff but then you triggered all of this with
[18:30.080 --> 18:35.520]  Charlie last week I was wasn't expecting that but if we can use all of this hype
[18:35.520 --> 18:38.840]  to get people to look at real information which is happening then God
[18:38.840 --> 18:43.560]  turns it into something good Charlie's just my friend who has changed a lot
[18:43.560 --> 18:50.000]  after a seven-month Jag that he was on and now is completely clean but a bit
[18:50.000 --> 18:53.840]  manic because of all the endorphins and the energy and I just hope he stays
[18:53.840 --> 18:57.720]  clean and comes through this unscathed because I know he's a good man who had
[18:57.720 --> 19:01.760]  a lot of courage to come out for 9-11 truth and when I've known him he's been
[19:01.760 --> 19:06.480]  a very calm focused researching person right now he's kind of going through a
[19:06.480 --> 19:13.480]  wild thing phase and he without sin let him cast the first stone and as I
[19:13.480 --> 19:18.040]  mentioned in the first little five-minute segment coming up at the
[19:18.040 --> 19:22.160]  bottom of the last hour coming up in about two hours and 15 minutes from now
[19:22.160 --> 19:25.320]  I will say a little bit about Charlie I had about an hour and a half discussion
[19:25.320 --> 19:30.080]  with him we've been talking every day since last week but I had a long hour
[19:30.080 --> 19:32.560]  and a half discussion and really know a lot of the things behind the scenes that
[19:32.560 --> 19:35.560]  are going on I'm not going to get into any of that because that's private but I
[19:35.560 --> 19:38.840]  can talk about a few things that are public and I can tell you what's real
[19:38.840 --> 19:44.160]  or what isn't out there obviously a lot of folks are asking us about that and it
[19:44.160 --> 19:49.240]  is now bound to this show what we're doing and so I think it is proper to
[19:49.240 --> 19:53.600]  talk a little bit about it also Howard Stern has been attacking me almost on
[19:53.600 --> 19:57.600]  a daily basis and people like well we're gonna about Howard Stern well now his

[24:29.360 --> 24:35.400]  an end here in the Wall Street Journal Time magazine coming out and saying our
[24:35.400 --> 24:43.040]  America's good days behind us now why are they now admitting what they're doing I
[24:43.040 --> 24:47.720]  want to go over their whole plan why they're doing this and hopefully talk
[24:47.720 --> 24:53.000]  to you the listeners about rallying the population of this country around the
[24:53.000 --> 24:57.560]  fact that the private Federal Reserve is completely criminal and is predatory
[24:57.560 --> 25:03.520]  and is the main author of this designed implosion that is now taking place this
[25:03.520 --> 25:10.920]  is such a big deal now in a separate issue I mentioned earlier Howard
[25:10.920 --> 25:14.640]  Stearns been putting tweets out I don't listen to his show very often even though
[25:14.640 --> 25:19.840]  I have it on XM so I haven't heard it myself but Jason Burmes and others have
[25:19.840 --> 25:23.760]  heard it and told us about it he's doing silly things like saying I've got a bad
[25:23.760 --> 25:29.120]  to pay if it wasn't to pay it would be bad no this is my hair folks it's falling
[25:29.120 --> 25:34.680]  out and I don't care but there's no to pay on earth looks like this this is my
[25:34.680 --> 25:41.520]  hair but it just shows the infantile nature of what America is basically fed
[25:41.520 --> 25:45.920]  through people like Howard Stern he said never heard of Alex Jones but listening
[25:45.920 --> 25:49.000]  to Charlie she'd interview I'm pretty sure Alex is wackier than Charlie
[25:49.000 --> 25:54.840]  outstanding he tweeted that he also put out in a tweet last year Jones predicted
[25:54.840 --> 25:58.080]  a coming race war in America to be brought on by the release of Robert
[25:58.080 --> 26:02.640]  Rodriguez's machete it didn't happen and and that's the kind of things that he's
[26:02.640 --> 26:08.760]  putting out really it didn't happen Westlake unrest dubbed LA machete
[26:08.760 --> 26:15.560]  riots by immigration restriction group and a lot of publications did report and
[26:15.560 --> 26:20.440]  there was a Google map of it six different riots including multiple
[26:20.440 --> 26:24.560]  events with men wielding machetes one of them had to be shot and killed by
[26:24.560 --> 26:31.880]  police the weekend that it was released what I said was if Robert Rodriguez
[26:31.880 --> 26:37.640]  didn't cut some of the things he had in that film out it could cause racial
[26:37.640 --> 26:41.240]  tension that could lead to a race war we've already seen the illegal aliens
[26:41.240 --> 26:47.360]  pulling down American flags in Texas Arizona in Florida and in California if
[26:47.360 --> 26:52.080]  kids wear American flags to school that's MSNBC Associated Press they're
[26:52.080 --> 26:56.920]  told take them off because it enrages the illegal aliens so much who are
[26:56.920 --> 27:00.360]  wearing their Mexican flags and taking down the school's flag and running up
[27:00.360 --> 27:04.880]  the Mexican flag you know my issue is Mexico's a country that lost wars with
[27:04.880 --> 27:11.200]  us Mexico teaches its school children the Southwest was wrongfully taken in
[27:11.200 --> 27:16.720]  the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and that if the people coming here wanted to
[27:16.720 --> 27:20.280]  get into liberty and the Second Amendment and free speech I'd be all
[27:20.280 --> 27:25.080]  for it but they don't they come from a country that has an incredible history
[27:25.080 --> 27:30.320]  of tyranny and corruption and no one can deny that and Rodriguez came out in the
[27:30.320 --> 27:34.320]  in the press in the Austin American Statesman and ain't it cool news and
[27:34.320 --> 27:39.320]  said that I wasn't telling the truth that I didn't have the script even though
[27:39.320 --> 27:42.720]  I got it directly from inside his operation when the movie came out it
[27:42.720 --> 27:47.320]  was word-for-word the script except for two or three scenes they cut that were
[27:47.320 --> 27:51.120]  the scenes we recommended they cut but it was still all about a race war and
[27:51.120 --> 27:56.640]  it was the equivalent of a Hispanic birth of a nation of course that was the
[27:56.640 --> 28:03.240]  Ku Klux Klan movie promoting race war so I was proven right but the media you
[28:03.240 --> 28:07.440]  know says there's no world government forming as it's forming they say
[28:07.440 --> 28:11.400]  fluoride the water isn't bad for you they say flu shots aren't bad for you and
[28:11.400 --> 28:20.040]  that we're wrong no we're right and so the film did cause was linked to some
[28:20.040 --> 28:25.360]  rioting and someone being shot it was wielding a machete there's no doubt that
[28:25.360 --> 28:29.840]  that's basically what happened here but my point was we had the script and he
[28:29.840 --> 28:33.320]  said we didn't and said that we were making stuff up later he told ain't it
[28:33.320 --> 28:38.280]  cool news yeah I may have too much tequila when I when I wrote the script so
[28:38.280 --> 28:42.000]  he contradicted himself and I am gonna cut some scenes that'll only be on the
[28:42.000 --> 28:48.200]  DVD I went a little too far so we told the truth they cut the really
[28:48.200 --> 28:52.800]  incendiary stuff out I mean they had the gringos crucifying the Catholic
[28:52.800 --> 28:58.600]  priests they had the cowboy hat wearing rednecks Robert De Niro and Don
[28:58.600 --> 29:02.880]  Johnson little Hispanic women who were pregnant begging don't kill my baby and
[29:02.880 --> 29:07.280]  then they shoot the woman in the stomach who's pregnant and make fun of you know
[29:07.280 --> 29:13.280]  dead babies and Hispanics I mean it was total race baiting division because the
[29:13.280 --> 29:17.400]  globalists don't want us coming together liberal conservative black white
[29:17.400 --> 29:21.760]  Hispanic against the TSA against the warrantless wiretapping against the
[29:21.760 --> 29:25.200]  illegal wars they don't want us coming together against the New World Order the
[29:25.200 --> 29:28.640]  Ford Foundation that funds the big universities and all this racial
[29:28.640 --> 29:32.400]  division and liberation theology wants this and that's what happened with
[29:32.400 --> 29:36.800]  Ron Regas and I know people that know him here in town he's into la reconquista I
[29:36.800 --> 29:41.720]  was told he didn't like me a decade ago when his wife gave him my films he said
[29:41.720 --> 29:46.800]  well that guy's not for my La Raza and so it is what it is and I'm right and
[29:46.800 --> 29:52.080]  Howard Stern is wrong but I mean give me a break we're on the march the

[34:29.360 --> 34:33.200]  and they basically announced this situation and this earth shattering
[34:33.200 --> 34:40.400]  development like it's no big deal this will cause massive
[34:40.400 --> 34:44.480]  dollar devaluation it will cause the dollar and the countries that hold
[34:44.480 --> 34:49.520]  trillions of dollars like china the middle east in the aggregate
[34:49.520 --> 34:52.880]  holds trillions the european union holds close to a trillion
[34:52.880 --> 34:56.640]  it will cause those holdings to lose value
[34:56.640 --> 34:59.520]  it will cause the value of the dollar to plunge
[34:59.520 --> 35:03.200]  triggering massive inflation it will decimate
[35:03.200 --> 35:07.520]  people on fixed incomes like social security or people working
[35:07.520 --> 35:15.040]  near the poverty line the working poor all our country had left was the dollar
[35:15.040 --> 35:18.640]  the industry's been shut down by the regulations and control and
[35:18.640 --> 35:23.120]  by the deals that have been signed with china globalism is a disease
[35:23.120 --> 35:26.720]  it is a cancer designed to create a race to the bottom
[35:26.720 --> 35:33.600]  a giant sucking sound remember 16 17 years ago in 1994 we have clips of it
[35:33.600 --> 35:39.120]  and my film fall the republic whenever
[35:39.120 --> 35:43.920]  ross perot went on television and said this will drop wages this will
[35:43.920 --> 35:50.480]  deindustrialize this will hurt this country he said the next few decades it
[35:50.480 --> 35:54.000]  will destroy us and the media laughed at him
[35:54.000 --> 35:58.720]  and al gore got up there and said this is a great deal larry
[35:58.720 --> 36:02.160]  you need to be quiet ross perot and kept interrupting him
[36:02.160 --> 36:06.880]  oh this is such a good deal and you could just look at him and know from
[36:06.880 --> 36:11.360]  history he was lying but also not just intellectually just watching him
[36:11.360 --> 36:16.960]  he was enjoying conning people and then he got together a few years later
[36:16.960 --> 36:21.360]  in 96 with ken lay at the white house with in ron
[36:21.360 --> 36:26.000]  and wrote up the carbon tax plan that we're now under
[36:26.000 --> 36:29.920]  i mean al gore is a criminal is a treacherous
[36:29.920 --> 36:34.800]  traitorous gangster setting up scams to make you and your family poor and
[36:34.800 --> 36:37.920]  consolidate wealth they want to post industrial america
[36:37.920 --> 36:41.680]  this is their goal i want to know what you think about it
[36:41.680 --> 36:48.960]  800-259-9231 just briefly getting back to machete
[36:48.960 --> 36:53.360]  in hollywood reporter they basically kicked off this narrative a few days ago
[36:53.360 --> 36:58.960]  the man behind charlie sheen's rants meet syndicated radio host alex jones
[36:58.960 --> 37:03.040]  and at the end of the article as a way to discredit me they say last year
[37:03.040 --> 37:07.440]  jones predicted a coming race war in america to be brought on by the
[37:07.440 --> 37:11.520]  release of robert rodriguez's machete it didn't happen
[37:11.520 --> 37:18.480]  really major newspapers reported on the six riots that happened in the two days
[37:18.480 --> 37:22.000]  after machete was released in southern california
[37:22.000 --> 37:25.840]  in every case knife and machete wielding people including one person
[37:25.840 --> 37:31.840]  having to be gunned down by police and at the very same time in the videos that
[37:31.840 --> 37:34.880]  they linked to in hollywood reporter to discredit me
[37:34.880 --> 37:39.200]  i talked about the headings happening in arizona by the drug
[37:39.200 --> 37:44.160]  cartels and how the script for machete talked about
[37:44.160 --> 37:49.840]  ongoing beheadings with machetes and i said this was certainly going to
[37:49.840 --> 37:54.320]  encourage this and increase it then when the movie came out
[37:54.320 --> 37:58.320]  and there were a bunch of beheadings in california in arizona
[37:58.320 --> 38:03.360]  and in south texas i was reading these out of major newspapers and
[38:03.360 --> 38:06.560]  watching it on local tv and in a different areas of the country
[38:06.560 --> 38:11.840]  arizona texas california a few other areas and it was mexican drug gangs
[38:11.840 --> 38:15.440]  chopping people's heads off and there were news articles that came out the
[38:15.440 --> 38:20.480]  time saying jones is lying there's no beheadings going on
[38:20.480 --> 38:25.040]  with machetes i was like excuse me i have all the mainstream articles
[38:25.040 --> 38:29.920]  they were counting on you being stupid they were counting on you not going and
[38:29.920 --> 38:34.480]  researching and looking it up so they're they're always
[38:34.480 --> 38:37.440]  announcing that we're wrong they're always announcing
[38:37.440 --> 38:40.640]  that that we've told people things that weren't true
[38:40.640 --> 38:45.120]  twisting what we said i said if he didn't cut the particularly
[38:45.120 --> 38:49.600]  race war invocations out of the film that there was a very good chance it was
[38:49.600 --> 38:52.320]  going to trigger it he did cut some of it out
[38:52.320 --> 38:56.160]  but i had the exact script i knew what areas were cut out it was word for word
[38:56.160 --> 38:59.120]  the exact script they lied and said i didn't have the script
[38:59.120 --> 39:07.680]  well i knew i had the script it came from a major hollywood manager
[39:07.680 --> 39:11.680]  it also came out of an austin office i'm not going to say who's office i think
[39:11.680 --> 39:15.120]  you can guess where's rodriguez based and then i also
[39:15.120 --> 39:18.960]  was sent a different version but only slightly of a rewrite
[39:18.960 --> 39:26.160]  from someone anonymously now that said every week or so
[39:26.160 --> 39:29.520]  i see new beheading stories uh here's one
[39:29.520 --> 39:34.880]  today police arizona beheading tied to mexican drug cartel
[39:34.880 --> 39:39.680]  and this is thursday march 3rd 2011 this is the day
[39:39.680 --> 39:43.520]  and and and sometimes i see these multiple times a week sometimes it takes a
[39:43.520 --> 39:46.960]  few weeks and when i say i see it every week i mean that's about
[39:46.960 --> 39:49.920]  how often i see it you may be seeing it more often
[39:49.920 --> 39:53.520]  but authorities have determined a man who was stabbed and beheaded in a
[39:53.520 --> 39:57.200]  suburban phoenix apartment was killed for stealing drugs from mexican cartel
[39:57.200 --> 40:02.080]  and a gruesome example of drug cartel violence spilling over the border
[40:02.080 --> 40:06.320]  and he reportedly stole 400 pounds of marijuana and meth from a drug cartel
[40:06.320 --> 40:11.840]  and got his head chopped off so there's oh by the way it wasn't just me who got
[40:11.840 --> 40:15.360]  attacked and they said i was making up the headings all over the u.s
[40:15.360 --> 40:20.000]  the governor when i talked about this on video it got picked up in the news
[40:20.000 --> 40:24.320]  the governor talked about the headings in arizona
[40:24.320 --> 40:28.640]  particularly when the coyotes catch people that didn't pay them to cross
[40:28.640 --> 40:33.280]  they chopped their heads off they found whole groups of people in arizona
[40:33.280 --> 40:38.560]  for years with their heads chopped off women raped and then they have their
[40:38.560 --> 40:42.160]  heads chopped off children having their heads chopped off
[40:42.160 --> 40:46.880]  they find whole barns on the mexican border with the us
[40:46.880 --> 40:52.000]  in one case just a few months ago with hundreds of dead chopped up and shot
[40:52.000 --> 40:55.920]  and what did the so-called liberal media do
[40:55.920 --> 40:59.440]  they just came out and said there's no heads being chopped off
[40:59.440 --> 41:02.960]  the arizona governor is a liar okay she's a liar
[41:02.960 --> 41:06.880]  all right here is the atlanta journal constitution
[41:06.880 --> 41:10.800]  they just reposted the associated press it'll be technical it's ap
[41:10.800 --> 41:17.440]  amanda lee meyers today another beheading doesn't exist okay
[41:17.440 --> 41:21.840]  uh now speaking of that whole area of discussion
[41:21.840 --> 41:28.880]  heads of us mexico to meet as tensions rise and they go on to report that
[41:28.880 --> 41:33.760]  obama is discussing putting armed u.s agents in
[41:33.760 --> 41:38.160]  mexico guys that was in my stack but now i can't
[41:38.160 --> 41:41.760]  find it when you put it on screen obama discussing putting armed us agents
[41:41.760 --> 41:48.880]  in mexico thank you which is a horrible horrible horrible idea
[41:48.880 --> 41:53.360]  they have had now in the last two years over 30 000 mexicans killed in the drug
[41:53.360 --> 41:56.560]  war thousands of them are government
[41:56.560 --> 42:01.360]  officials and police and military i mean in one week they killed a few
[42:01.360 --> 42:06.320]  months ago what was it four mayors shot three of them chopped the head off of
[42:06.320 --> 42:10.640]  another three or four or five i i can't even remember i think it was
[42:10.640 --> 42:16.480]  maybe it was five there it is afp obama to discuss armed us
[42:16.480 --> 42:20.240]  agents in mexico the united states will discuss the idea of us armed agents
[42:20.240 --> 42:23.360]  operating inside mexico which is being rocked by deadly drug
[42:23.360 --> 42:26.320]  violence when president barack obama meets his mexican counterpart
[42:26.320 --> 42:29.920]  philippe calderon a u.s senior official said yesterday
[42:29.920 --> 42:33.440]  obama welcomes calderon to the white house today it's a top
[42:33.440 --> 42:37.360]  priority for the u.s government to ensure the measures are being taken to
[42:37.360 --> 42:40.960]  protect our personnel the official said speaking on condition and
[42:40.960 --> 42:44.400]  limiting oh yeah because we've had all those embassy workers shot killed
[42:44.400 --> 42:49.920]  stabbed and beheaded oh that's been happening too
[42:49.920 --> 42:53.680]  but howard stern says it's not happening so
[42:53.680 --> 42:59.760]  because he knows how to make flatulence jokes it must be true
[42:59.760 --> 43:04.080]  i mean it's it's it's crazy all these news articles i've seen
[43:04.080 --> 43:07.040]  since i exposed machete almost a year ago now
[43:07.040 --> 43:12.320]  or i don't know nine ten months ago have been proven wrong
[43:12.320 --> 43:16.160]  we've we've been proven right but they don't care they just declare that we've
[43:16.160 --> 43:19.600]  lost and hope that people aren't paying attention
[43:19.600 --> 43:24.240]  they think you're stupid now continuing heads of us mexico to meet
[43:24.240 --> 43:28.640]  as tensions rise violence from drug war to top agenda as calderon visits obama
[43:28.640 --> 43:32.560]  today now that's out of the wall street journal
[43:32.560 --> 43:36.800]  if they decriminalize cocaine and heroin and
[43:36.800 --> 43:41.840]  marijuana which i'm not saying is is is you know is good to use those things
[43:41.840 --> 43:44.960]  in every study in every european country that's done it doesn't mean you sell it
[43:44.960 --> 43:49.600]  to school kids doesn't no no you control it
[43:49.600 --> 43:53.520]  and on average within about two years drug use drops by half
[43:53.520 --> 43:58.080]  it's no longer seen as sexy and cool the money isn't involved in it
[43:58.080 --> 44:02.880]  and so there aren't all the women and and and fast cars and mansions associated
[44:02.880 --> 44:07.200]  with it then young people can't be involved in it as a business
[44:07.200 --> 44:11.520]  addicts crime always plunges again by around 50 percent
[44:11.520 --> 44:14.880]  on average because if they can go to the corner
[44:14.880 --> 44:20.160]  corner clinic and get their heroin for free through a welfare program
[44:20.160 --> 44:23.680]  uh and it's medical grade they're given smaller amounts of it
[44:23.680 --> 44:27.360]  um are they going to break into your houses steal your jewelry and computer
[44:27.360 --> 44:31.920]  and if they happen to catch you there kill you uh because they need to uh
[44:31.920 --> 44:35.600]  get their fix by putting a needle in their arm
[44:35.600 --> 44:39.280]  is a crackhead going to carjack you and your family
[44:39.280 --> 44:42.080]  because they got to have crack the uh crack zombies
[44:42.080 --> 44:46.160]  that we see uh running around on the streets of every major city with their
[44:46.160 --> 44:50.000]  hair falling out looking like something out of day of the dead zombies
[44:50.000 --> 44:53.760]  i remember growing up in dallas as a as a teenager and just seeing the crack
[44:53.760 --> 44:59.680]  zombies i mean you'd see people who you'd see white people with their hair
[44:59.680 --> 45:03.360]  all fallen out who had like green skin sores all over their face
[45:03.360 --> 45:09.680]  you would see black people so so near the edge of death that they were white
[45:09.680 --> 45:12.720]  i mean they look like they were dead like all the blood was out of them with
[45:12.720 --> 45:17.280]  with with their hair falling out no teeth they come up to your car window
[45:17.280 --> 45:20.640]  and a woman with no teeth would drool running out of her mouth and would look
[45:20.640 --> 45:24.160]  like sores all over who look like she weighed about 80 pounds
[45:24.160 --> 45:30.480]  would say baby let me in the car i'll do all this for five dollars
[45:30.480 --> 45:33.760]  and then you heard you know you heardly wait for the
[45:33.760 --> 45:37.440]  red light to change you can speed away that would all
[45:37.440 --> 45:41.520]  end if you decriminalized it and the crime and the murders
[45:41.520 --> 45:48.080]  and the corruption it's a fact it's a fact oh but we have the biggest drug war
[45:48.080 --> 45:51.280]  in the world and our country roughly uses half of the
[45:51.280 --> 45:53.840]  illegal drugs in the world what an incredible number
[45:53.840 --> 45:57.120]  that corrupts the police it corrupts the society
[45:57.120 --> 46:00.560]  it corrupts our young people it's seen as sexy and cool
[46:00.560 --> 46:06.320]  drugs aren't sexy drugs aren't cool don't use them don't take them don't
[46:06.320 --> 46:09.360]  ever start don't ever put that chew into back in your
[46:09.360 --> 46:13.280]  mouth don't ever smoke a cigarette don't it'll take 30 years off your life
[46:13.280 --> 46:19.920]  it's addictive it's hard to beat don't ever take cocaine don't ever take opiates
[46:19.920 --> 46:24.880]  if you have your back hurt in a car wreck tough it out without painkillers
[46:24.880 --> 46:33.200]  i'm telling you you do not want to get addicted
[46:33.200 --> 46:37.040]  there is so much going on there is so much happening here
[46:37.040 --> 46:40.160]  and so let me give you the larger situation and then we'll go to your
[46:40.160 --> 46:43.120]  phone calls and then come up at the bottom of the hour next hour we got
[46:43.120 --> 46:50.240]  popping in from Cairo Egypt Max Kaiser in the spp documents
[46:50.240 --> 46:53.600]  that judicial watch student got and i talk about these so much
[46:53.600 --> 46:56.480]  just like i talk about governor ridge eight and a half years ago in a two hour

[47:13.600 --> 47:17.120]  almost nine years later and that's all being rolled out
[47:17.120 --> 47:20.720]  it took them that long to get it ready there are certain
[47:20.720 --> 47:25.920]  key globalist events that we either sue and get the documents or they go
[47:25.920 --> 47:28.560]  ahead and think nobody's watching and talk about it on c-span
[47:28.560 --> 47:33.440]  that give you total blueprint it's like getting the enemy battle
[47:33.440 --> 47:37.680]  plans and so that you know there are dozens and dozens and dozens of things
[47:37.680 --> 47:42.000]  i harp on because there's such
[47:42.000 --> 47:46.240]  key information their their manifestos their blueprints their
[47:46.240 --> 47:52.960]  their battle plans their programs now judicial watch sued for over a year got
[47:52.960 --> 47:57.040]  the 1996 bam Canada spp meetings

[48:00.720 --> 48:03.440]  secretly with the centay fox and also the
[48:03.440 --> 48:07.520]  canadian prime minister in waco texas no one had ever
[48:07.520 --> 48:10.480]  gotten the info it was a secret agreement secret treaty
[48:10.480 --> 48:15.760]  high treason on its face even world net dailies experts wrote that
[48:15.760 --> 48:18.480]  it's treason to have the president signing secret treaties he doesn't even
[48:18.480 --> 48:22.720]  have that power the senate has to ratify it but they don't care
[48:22.720 --> 48:26.640]  they controlled the bureaucracy now judicial watch
[48:26.640 --> 48:31.120]  was able to sue over and over again and got thousands of pages of it and
[48:31.120 --> 48:34.800]  published much of it at judicial watch website but i want to get judicial
[48:34.800 --> 48:38.160]  watch back on about that and what did it say
[48:38.160 --> 48:42.000]  they got it in 2007 i put it in the endgame blueprint for global enslavement

[49:03.280 --> 49:06.560]  website this is so important folks look at what
[49:06.560 --> 49:10.320]  we have and they said we're going to use crises we're going to use
[49:10.320 --> 49:15.040]  biological threats like the flu we're going to use economic collapse
[49:15.040 --> 49:18.880]  and we're going to use the drug war as a pretext to use mexican and canadian
[49:18.880 --> 49:23.520]  troops in the us and vice versa with both other countries
[49:23.520 --> 49:28.320]  what was in the news last week oh opama signs north american security

[49:36.640 --> 49:41.200]  with guatemala understand how key this is
[49:41.200 --> 49:44.880]  they went on and said we're going to use the drug war threat and the violence
[49:44.880 --> 49:47.280]  that will increase they knew when they were about to put
[49:47.280 --> 49:50.720]  calderone in to declare war on the drug cartels they didn't control this
[49:50.720 --> 49:53.760]  would happen they create the crisis just like they
[49:53.760 --> 49:57.040]  start the revolutions of the middle east doesn't mean they control them they
[49:57.040 --> 50:00.800]  can start them it's easy to set a house on fire
[50:00.800 --> 50:03.520]  and then show up later saying you're the fire department
[50:03.520 --> 50:07.280]  that's what the globalists do and so they said we're going to use the drug
[50:07.280 --> 50:11.200]  war crisis the flu crisis and uh the terror
[50:11.200 --> 50:14.720]  threat and also economic threat those four things to do this

[50:49.280 --> 50:53.120]  using all this drug war stuff to not just merge the countries by

[54:05.280 --> 54:09.760]  so the globalists told us in their own SPP documents that they didn't want us to
[54:09.760 --> 54:14.160]  see how things really worked and there were a little over 100
[54:14.160 --> 54:19.440]  corporate CEOs from all over the world at that Banff Canada three-day meeting
[54:19.440 --> 54:23.040]  at that resort shut down basically a Bilderberg group type meeting
[54:23.040 --> 54:27.680]  and they had big working groups and the CEOs then gave orders
[54:27.680 --> 54:32.640]  to the heads of the federal bureaucracies of Canada Mexico in the US
[54:32.640 --> 54:37.440]  and then you could see everything in that document then being implemented
[54:37.440 --> 54:42.800]  by stealth this is corporate government and when i flew up to new york last
[54:42.800 --> 54:48.160]  week sunday i was on the plane with a major banking CEO
[54:48.160 --> 54:54.000]  and he just basically tried to sell me on we need a corporate government
[54:54.000 --> 54:57.200]  running america you mean the ones that create the derivatives and rob everybody
[54:57.200 --> 55:00.800]  the ones that want to take our guns the ones that are for one-child policies you
[55:00.800 --> 55:04.480]  mean you guys should run things
[55:05.120 --> 55:10.320]  it was almost like the speech howard bill gets that we played last week
[55:10.320 --> 55:14.080]  when he says you've meddled with the title forges of nature mr bill
[55:14.080 --> 55:20.400]  and you will atone am i getting through to you mr bill
[55:20.400 --> 55:24.480]  and i'm watching their battle plan i'm watching everything they do
[55:24.480 --> 55:28.160]  and they're down there in mexico trying to mop up drug cartels that they didn't
[55:28.160 --> 55:32.080]  control with the 500 billion coming into the us they control most of them and
[55:32.080 --> 55:35.200]  that's all this is and now when it spills over here
[55:35.200 --> 55:38.720]  they're going to use it and the attorney general saying to try to ban assault
[55:38.720 --> 55:42.080]  weapons and restrict gun purchases to one at a time
[55:42.080 --> 55:46.000]  all because they have a gun ban in mexico and the people are
[55:46.000 --> 55:50.320]  living in a nightmare and we have to basically harmonize our laws with
[55:50.320 --> 55:56.000]  mexico it's incredible and it's all over the news today
[55:56.000 --> 56:01.600]  the good news is though a whole bunch of states including texas
[56:01.600 --> 56:05.440]  are mulling arizona style illegal immigration law
[56:05.440 --> 56:08.880]  but i almost called paul watson this morning to have him write a blurber an
[56:08.880 --> 56:13.600]  article saying texas mulls mexican style immigration law
[56:13.600 --> 56:17.440]  it's always how horrible if somebody's here illegally and they get caught doing
[56:17.440 --> 56:21.280]  another crime they might get a deported oh it's so terrible
[56:21.280 --> 56:25.200]  mexico has some of the most draconian immigration laws in the world
[56:25.200 --> 56:29.680]  this is mainstream news mexico admits it they put people for at least a year in
[56:29.680 --> 56:32.960]  a forced labor camp if they're caught from latin america
[56:32.960 --> 56:35.840]  coming into mexico i'm not saying do that i'm just saying
[56:35.840 --> 56:39.360]  deport illegal aliens especially if they're running around waving their
[56:39.360 --> 56:42.400]  foreign countries flags saying down with america
[56:42.400 --> 56:46.240]  i mean get out of here you have to pledge that you want to be
[56:46.240 --> 56:49.280]  a u.s citizen and that you'll follow the bill of rights and constitution
[56:49.280 --> 56:53.280]  and take that oath to become a citizen i don't have to i was born here
[56:53.280 --> 56:57.520]  but the point is if you declare yourself as a america hater
[56:57.520 --> 57:01.840]  get out of here okay but but this is all oh my gosh
[57:01.840 --> 57:05.760]  texas might try to have an arizona style immigration law you may not have
[57:05.760 --> 57:08.480]  sanctuary cities where the illegal aliens are above the law
[57:08.480 --> 57:12.720]  oh my goodness that would be terrible but the real headline should be here
[57:12.720 --> 57:19.440]  texas mulls mexican immigration law but but but then it would say well not
[57:19.440 --> 57:22.480]  actually uh we're not going to put people in forced labor camps and we'll
[57:22.480 --> 57:25.520]  have links to all that we're not going to beat them up and suck money out of
[57:25.520 --> 57:29.280]  them and treat them like mexico does no texas is mulling
[57:29.280 --> 57:36.160]  the the moderate uh uh uh arizona law see but that's how the media creates all
[57:36.160 --> 57:39.520]  this emotion and says if you've got brown skin you're
[57:39.520 --> 57:42.960]  going to get arrested and put in a camp oh sure you are
[57:42.960 --> 57:47.120]  what half the country has brown skin the white people are all out
[57:47.120 --> 57:52.240]  suntan and trying to have brown skin i mean i mean nobody cares the media
[57:52.240 --> 57:56.640]  hypes all this race stuff to create the division and i'm sick of it
[57:56.640 --> 57:59.840]  i don't care what color you are if you believe in private property
[57:59.840 --> 58:03.280]  family the second amendment and sovereignty of this country

[58:06.400 --> 58:10.320]  your friend but you get so freaked out by an american flag
[58:10.320 --> 58:13.920]  that you send american school children including hispanic's home

[01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:31.840]  we are now into hour number two i've covered a host of key issues i'll
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:35.920]  recap right now we're going to go into your phone calls
[01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:41.760]  let's talk to patients in kansas you're on the air welcome
[01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:45.600]  thanks alex you know i was listening in on what you're talking about that
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:49.440]  arizona law remember when obama came out and he
[01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:52.960]  said that that sounded racist and that was such a horrible law in the way that
[01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:55.760]  they were going about it and he was standing up against it
[01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:59.040]  i don't know what his problem is with that because
[01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:04.560]  when operation phoenix came out in san bernadino and cops from fontana
[01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:08.720]  were allowed into san bernadino along with a lot of other
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:12.480]  official figures that shouldn't have been there they went door to door collecting
[01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:15.600]  kids for cps at four o'clock in the morning and stuff
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:19.120]  these cops from fontana were running around calling little children
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:23.440]  the n word okay and apparently the mayor of that
[01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:28.480]  town the founder of operation phoenix in san bernadino
[01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:33.600]  went and met with joe biden okay and joe biden thinks that this operation phoenix
[01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:37.120]  thing is great but oh no no no when the police go door to door
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:40.400]  in boston and new york and chicago for knock and talk
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:44.080]  and demand to be let in to quote look for illegal guns without warrants
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:48.240]  that's great when the government listens to you without warrants that's great
[01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:51.840]  when all of that's happening it's wonderful but heaven forbid if we've
[01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:55.520]  already arrested an illegal for committing a crime that when we know
[01:01:55.520 --> 01:02:00.640]  they're illegal we also charge them with that heaven forbid

[01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:28.400]  for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:32.800]  the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty

[01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:04.560]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:08.400]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:11.280]  bill number two our new energies are wants to
[01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:14.560]  control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:17.520]  it's true total government control of electricity
[01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:21.040]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three
[01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:24.640]  in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:28.560]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:32.080]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:35.200]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:38.320]  onages number five a solar power generator provides
[01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:42.080]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar

[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:49.840]  why the dollars rain is near an end that is the wall street journal saying the
[01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:53.920]  dollar will die in the near future but they talk about oh it might cause a few
[01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:56.800]  market disruptions yeah like people on fixed incomes being in
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:59.840]  deep trouble massive dollar devaluation
[01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:03.680]  the u.s won't be able to buy foreign goods cheaply anymore
[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:10.080]  this is the equivalent of a economic armageddon now not on the horizon but
[01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:13.600]  right down the street and we're going to be going
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:18.480]  over that with keiser as well when he joins us
[01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:23.680]  also i want to get into some of the other economic news
[01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:28.800]  that we are seeing here as well some of the new wiki leaks information
[01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:32.880]  and huge new police state developments but even time magazine says
[01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:37.200]  are the good times over for america that's one of the
[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:42.320]  other headlines that is out there but right now let's go ahead and go back to
[01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:45.440]  your calls bill in connecticut you're on the air
[01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:49.040]  yeah hi alex i have just four quick bullet points
[01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:52.800]  number one i don't know how anyone could question your credibility
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:56.480]  when on your program when i started began listening in october
[01:09:56.480 --> 01:09:59.760]  when lindsay william predicted the explosion
[01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:03.600]  the the middle east exploding in exactly four months
[01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:08.320]  uh... number two um you really shut those women down on the view it's the
[01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:12.560]  first time that i've seen it a guest come in an absolutely hammer
[01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:16.480]  that the guest house oh i can hammer anybody if it's live i'd love to take
[01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:21.120]  down a riley but he's he's scared well those women look petrified when you
[01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:23.840]  were on which was actually pretty funny
[01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:27.680]  uh... the third point um if you can talk to perhaps
[01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:30.480]  ron paul when he's on you had made a a cogent
[01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:35.120]  point about uh saying if the banks had paid all that money back which they
[01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:38.560]  said they have wouldn't the debt be reduced
[01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:42.800]  by a commensurate amount in other words wouldn't it be down to 12
[01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:46.960]  trillion instead of 14 well and that's only what's due now and that's only
[01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:50.160]  federal look here's what happened
[01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:54.000]  they got three different quote bailouts that were really takeovers
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:58.560]  and the media only focused on the 887 billion
[01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:01.920]  that the banks then got at zero interest and loaned out at 10
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:05.520]  20 30 uh cnn reported i didn't even know this
[01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:08.400]  last month in fact let's pull it up for folks they won't believe it
[01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:12.480]  uh cnn.com and then put in after it
[01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:19.360]  credit card rates now at 59.9 so imagine
[01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:24.320]  they get free money at zero they loaned it out at 10 20 30 40 50
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:28.240]  almost 60 depending on who as people go into debt
[01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:32.480]  and then they paid some of that money back but it wasn't talking about the
[01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:34.960]  open window the fellow reserve creating tens of
[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:38.080]  trillions bloomberg reported over a year ago it was 23.7
[01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:41.440]  then other four plus trillions that's 28 trillion uh they weren't counting all
[01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:45.120]  the secret loans or the secret money transfers
[01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:49.360]  uh to things like msnbc and hundreds of other u.s corporations
[01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:54.080]  so the media did a straw man or or lying by omission
[01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:58.640]  they only focused on one area but that 887 billion
[01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:02.720]  we now learned about a year after so now two years into it
[01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:06.160]  or three years into it total but about a year into it year and a half into it
[01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:09.760]  we learned uh that folks you can look all this
[01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:14.000]  up when i'm saying this is fact that that oh that 887 billion was a
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.360]  revolving door of credit they were doing it over
[01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:23.120]  and over again every few months now you see the headlines a month to go out of
[01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:27.360]  davos switzerland the davos public billderberg group meeting
[01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:32.240]  oh i'm sorry let me let me apologize i saw an earlier CNN
[01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:39.680]  that said 69 i'm sorry my credit card had 79.9 ap r so
[01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:45.600]  some people are are getting 79.9 loan sharking is 30 percent but going back
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:48.880]  to davos but we'll put that headline out people
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:54.880]  won't believe it davos davos wants 100 trillion
[01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:59.920]  in additional liquidity now they get 100 trillion back by
[01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:04.560]  western taxpayers then they leverage it one to ten
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:07.920]  so that's now one quadrillion one thousand trillion
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:11.600]  and then they leverage it out again through different layer derivatives
[01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:14.320]  the sky's the limit so so they're talking about
[01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:18.480]  thousands of trillions publicly they're talking about 100 trillion
[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:21.760]  and we're having debates about banks giving back loans of a few hundred
[01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:24.480]  billion uh there's the london telegraph headline world
[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:28.160]  needs 100 trillion more credit says world economic forum
[01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:32.800]  sorry go any other comments sir well just two more comments
[01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:37.280]  but when you say 100 trillion is that coming out of
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:41.200]  the american taxpayers pocket absolutely do you mean explain how it works
[01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:45.840]  yeah i would okay they have all of the major western nations australia
[01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:50.320]  canada germany france or through the e u england the us
[01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:57.280]  we contribute the seed money so say the us pumps 100 billion and that's
[01:13:57.280 --> 01:14:01.680]  a public number then we find out about hundreds of billions more in secret
[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:06.880]  they then leverage it but since 1999 they don't have glass
[01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:10.480]  stigl anymore so before they had the rule of about one to ten for every one
[01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:13.120]  dollar you put in a bank the bank not just the
[01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:17.600]  bigger federal reserve banks can loan out uh ten more dollars you put a
[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:21.120]  thousand in ten thousand you put a million in 10 million you put 10 million
[01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:24.160]  in uh you know they can put out a hundred million
[01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:27.760]  put a hundred million in you see the math but in
[01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:33.520]  99 the bankers always had the global rule of
[01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:37.200]  eight dollars out for every dollar ten dollars out for every dollar
[01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:40.720]  nations varied but they always knew that it caused hyperinflation if they went
[01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:43.360]  above that or it made the hyperinflation happen
[01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:47.040]  too fast at all but any fractional system causes
[01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:51.120]  inflation overall but but time hides that inflation
[01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:57.200]  tax now they have layered debt structure derivatives that in some cases
[01:14:57.200 --> 01:15:02.800]  are over 60 layers deep and all of it is counterfeit and fraud so
[01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:06.720]  they're not leveraging at one to ten they leverage it ten times and then they
[01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:10.400]  leverage all of that dozens and dozens of times a piece
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:14.640]  and then leverage the derivatives of that dozens and dozens of times a piece
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:20.480]  so even mainstream media admits that it's somewhere around a hundred
[01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:24.080]  excuse me a thousand trillion in derivatives that's the too big to fail
[01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:27.280]  so they get us to bind our pension funds our countries to that
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:31.600]  it's impossible to pay back but but but the public doesn't understand that
[01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:34.960]  and so it's set up that as things get worse and worse the bankers absorb
[01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:39.680]  everything through fraud and then they get failed out when they go down
[01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:43.200]  well or they just blow out a company like enron they've already moved the
[01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:45.360]  money out the door have you seen the movie
[01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:49.520]  good fellas how they come in take over the guy's bar in restaurant
[01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:52.560]  never pay for any of the liquor never pay for any of them
[01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:56.160]  the veal or the chicken at the restaurant never pay
[01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:59.600]  you know for insurance nothing and then
[01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:02.480]  a year into this after they've done nothing but profit
[01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:05.680]  they burn the place down and get the insurance money
[01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:09.360]  so they burn in in ron down i told people two years before in ron imploded it

[01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:23.040]  bbc news news website basically the guy called johnny bald was a local well
[01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:26.480]  famous children's presenter science presenter and basically the
[01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:30.000]  luminosity in the bbc have better ridicule him over the climate
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:33.360]  change fraudness he's basically come out to look at the total fraud
[01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:36.240]  and basically what they're doing now obviously in the local schools around

[01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:34.960]  and it's just basically it's the little eyes well yeah that's how we got david
[01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:38.160]  the Rothschild on three years ago four years ago he had that children's book
[01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:43.760]  with the polar bear drowning uh on the front uh and because they're the best
[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:50.000]  mammal uh best swimming land mammal obviously they're not better swimmers
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.640]  than a dolphin or a whale that are mammals as well
[01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:56.080]  and they don't care and that's how i got him on was by calling the publisher
[01:27:56.080 --> 01:27:59.200]  and getting him on the show but uh that's another way they make money so
[01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:02.240]  there's you're saying the schools because i know it was designed for schools
[01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:06.080]  are purchasing this book from him and making the kids read it
[01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:09.280]  yeah uh but basically my son brought it home and i was just looking through it
[01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:12.480]  and you know i said look you know you you got to realize it's a total fraud
[01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:15.200]  and basically that they're ingesting it in the children
[01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:18.960]  and to make you know climate change is is is dangerous and
[01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:22.800]  we're all gonna die and things like that you know so basically you know it's
[01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:27.680]  about giving children a self-loathing of humanity and a self-hatred
[01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:31.360]  and i've talked to so many parents who i know personally who after brainwashing
[01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:33.680]  at school their eight-year-old or seven-year-old daughter
[01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:36.960]  will break down crying when they see a construction site
[01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:41.120]  saying they're killing bambi they're killing bambi uh and this is all about
[01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:44.080]  imprinting a guilt on the children that they're like little
[01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:49.600]  Nazis or something and that humans are bad and having children are bad
[01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:52.880]  yeah i mean obviously this johnny bowland and the guy called david bellamy
[01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:57.520]  lord mongton are probably know who these are a great but bottomist david bellamy
[01:28:57.520 --> 01:29:00.160]  and again that the ridicule even him uh on national
[01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:05.760]  british tv and just but you know but basically mock them basically
[01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:08.880]  well we're gonna have to get lord mongton back on again man on in two or
[01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:13.120]  three months let's get lord mongton back on a true staple of this broadcast to

[01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:28.560]  rollouts of plant and animal life as they roll out with super weapons
[01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:32.240]  endangering the planet uh no controls over heavy
[01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:36.000]  superconducting super colliders doing experiments that they admit could
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.800]  destroy the planet or seriously damage it
[01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:43.040]  i mean there's a score of serious issues that threaten this earth
[01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:46.720]  and it sure isn't carbon dioxide that are part of the carbon cycle on this

[01:39:25.120 --> 01:39:30.480]  ground in kairu max keiser thank you for joining us via video skype
[01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:35.360]  yeah my pleasure alex jones always a pleasure to be on the info wars yes i'm
[01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:39.680]  in kairu egypt and what i can tell you alex is that
[01:39:39.680 --> 01:39:44.720]  revolutions work revolutions work the people here
[01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:47.920]  have staged a revolution of people's revolution
[01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:52.240]  they toppled the dictator mubarak mubarak tried to put somebody else in
[01:39:52.240 --> 01:39:57.120]  that guy is now gone uh there's a huge rally here in takheir square
[01:39:57.120 --> 01:40:03.040]  friday uh for people amassing once again uh the objective is to write a new
[01:40:03.040 --> 01:40:09.040]  constitution and i urge everybody who listens to your show to take a look at
[01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:13.120]  what's happening here in kairu because you've got a dictator
[01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:17.840]  they're the federal reserve bank there needs to be a regime change in the u.s.
[01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:21.760]  if egyptians can revolt and get rid of the dictator
[01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:25.120]  why can't americans revolt and get rid of their dictators
[01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:30.080]  and it all happened on new media it all happened on social networking and i was
[01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:33.840]  talking a lot of the administrators and the revolutionaries here
[01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:38.640]  and they just told me that everybody was on facebook and social networking sites
[01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:44.000]  so and then one day uh as if by some spontaneous magic of a revolutionary
[01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:47.440]  fever just corrupt the entire country and they said you know what
[01:40:47.440 --> 01:40:51.120]  why don't we just topple this government and here's the key alex
[01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:54.640]  i had one of the revolutionaries on my show as a guest today and i asked them
[01:40:54.640 --> 01:40:57.920]  straightforward i said who's leading the revolution
[01:40:57.920 --> 01:41:03.760]  and the answer is no one because there is no straight leadership it's a social
[01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:07.680]  network revolution the first in history so there's no big to go out and attack
[01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:11.200]  nobody could say well let's get the revolutionary leader and the revolution
[01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:15.520]  dies it's not going to happen this is going to continue until you breathe
[01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:20.000]  a real true people's movement here in egypt and
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:24.640]  what's amazing is that the people here will speak their mind
[01:41:24.640 --> 01:41:27.440]  and then they'll try to catch themselves and they say
[01:41:27.440 --> 01:41:30.880]  oh i wonder if the police are listening and then they have that moment of
[01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:33.920]  recognition where they realize that wait a minute the police aren't listening i'm
[01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:38.320]  free can contrast that with people in america now
[01:41:38.320 --> 01:41:42.240]  who speak their mind and then have a moment of recognition where they wonder
[01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:46.000]  are is the police listening to me and then they shut up
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:50.240]  okay it's two ships passing in the night alex america going toward
[01:41:50.240 --> 01:41:55.200]  dictatorship and tyranny egypt heading toward democracy and freedom
[01:41:55.200 --> 01:41:58.880]  max a beautiful shot over your shoulder there of the
[01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:05.120]  Mediterranean off of your shoulder or is that or is that uh oh
[01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:10.720]  now that's the Nile uh there uh show uh there's a little bit of a reverb because
[01:42:10.720 --> 01:42:15.120]  you're talking kind of towards the glass door if you can rotate to your right
[01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:19.360]  about 10 or 15 degrees and and move the laptop it won't be as cool a shot
[01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:23.840]  but your audio won't be bouncing off uh that glass door there at your hotel or
[01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:26.800]  on the roof or wherever you're at i just want to try to be able to really
[01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:30.480]  clearly hear you hear max but the audio is
[01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:34.960]  is passable i i'm not taking issue with you but
[01:42:34.960 --> 01:42:38.480]  there's no doubt that the globalist tracking social networks a month and a
[01:42:38.480 --> 01:42:41.040]  half ago knowing food prices were going up due to
[01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:44.480]  dollar devaluation uh in the middle east knew that a revolution
[01:42:44.480 --> 01:42:46.720]  was coming the dominoes were already set up
[01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:50.240]  they tried to trigger it sending in albarity
[01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:53.520]  a few weeks before it began there's no doubt the west wants to overthrow
[01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:57.280]  qaddafi there's no doubt that the rebellion is real but i'm worried
[01:42:57.280 --> 01:43:01.440]  about the overall aftershocks of this but you're saying you have
[01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:06.400]  confidence uh max keiser that this is real this is organic
[01:43:06.400 --> 01:43:09.600]  yeah it is real and it is organic i'm on the street i'm talking to these people
[01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:13.040]  directly i'm doing shows right here and they
[01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:18.080]  have the notion now that they can rebuild this country in their image and
[01:43:18.080 --> 01:43:21.840]  people's revolution is on the street and it's spreading around this whole
[01:43:21.840 --> 01:43:25.840]  this whole region as you know and what's beautiful about the social networking
[01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:29.360]  sites is part of the info wars as you know
[01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:32.800]  the what's beautiful about it as i said there's no
[01:43:32.800 --> 01:43:36.480]  leader to attack so it's a widespread it's it's
[01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:41.840]  decentralized and then the idea itself is bigger than any leader
[01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:45.040]  and so this is happening it's gathering speed
[01:43:45.040 --> 01:43:48.480]  and the people as i said it's like two ships passing in the night i when i'm
[01:43:48.480 --> 01:43:51.760]  here in egypt there's a feeling of freedom and new freedom
[01:43:51.760 --> 01:43:54.960]  and when i talk to people america it's a freedom of shutting down
[01:43:54.960 --> 01:43:58.080]  heading into the prison state heading into the gulag state
[01:43:58.080 --> 01:44:02.400]  so it's a complete opposite feeling here is genuine freedom people really have a
[01:44:02.400 --> 01:44:07.120]  taste for it and it's remarkable so the people are genuinely angry uh but
[01:44:07.120 --> 01:44:11.520]  there's not a clear leadership and if the leadership doesn't deliver
[01:44:11.520 --> 01:44:14.880]  what the people want the people now know the power they have
[01:44:14.880 --> 01:44:19.280]  uh you're saying the momentum has shifted towards the independent
[01:44:19.280 --> 01:44:25.680]  uh person uh getting more freedom absolutely uh the power has shifted
[01:44:25.680 --> 01:44:28.880]  and and exactly right uh no matter what the
[01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:33.760]  current leadership and office uh suggests is there's what they want to do
[01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:38.480]  the people are responding for example they try to put in a new prime minister
[01:44:38.480 --> 01:44:42.080]  recently today he resigned because the people said we don't want that guy
[01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:46.000]  now imagine if that the people in america had the power to choose
[01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:50.720]  uh who was maybe going to run or not run the federal reserve bank for example
[01:44:50.720 --> 01:44:54.560]  i mean what a remarkable idea democracy what a remarkable idea
[01:44:54.560 --> 01:44:57.680]  people power and the key to this whole
[01:44:57.680 --> 01:45:02.560]  um technologically enabled enhanced uh revolution and of course the government
[01:45:02.560 --> 01:45:05.280]  can't shut down the internet without shutting down
[01:45:05.280 --> 01:45:08.800]  the entire country so they don't have that option
[01:45:08.800 --> 01:45:12.400]  so they are beat uh this this current leadership of this country around the
[01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:17.280]  region are basically out of business and and this is uh the people now are
[01:45:17.280 --> 01:45:21.120]  pushing forward and of course it's not based on islam it's not based on any
[01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:24.320]  politics it's not based on any religion i see glenn beck
[01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:28.080]  over in the uk and in the u.s is trying to push this line
[01:45:28.080 --> 01:45:31.920]  that this is an islamicist caliphate revolution
[01:45:31.920 --> 01:45:35.120]  which is completely wrong and there's not there's nothing religious or
[01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:37.760]  theocratic about this people's revolution well there's certainly the
[01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:42.240]  muslim brotherhood element in it but but but expanding on that uh looking
[01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:45.120]  to the west there with what's happening in libya
[01:45:45.120 --> 01:45:49.360]  what's your view on muammar qaddafi with all the british weapons he's got
[01:45:49.360 --> 01:45:53.200]  uh the open talk of having some type of nato slash un slash
[01:45:53.200 --> 01:45:59.120]  us uh ad hoc group uh going in there currently backing the rebels in the
[01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:01.760]  east they're on the border uh with egypt what do you think about the
[01:46:01.760 --> 01:46:05.360]  incredible turmoil popping up in saudi arabia do you see this
[01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:09.520]  thing spreading well the question with qaddafi you
[01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:13.200]  have to ask yourself is they they discovered he's got 30 billion
[01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:16.400]  dollars parked in banks in the uk and the us
[01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:20.640]  now that money was parked after the patriot act was enacted
[01:46:20.640 --> 01:46:24.080]  which supposedly put in rules and force that would
[01:46:24.080 --> 01:46:27.200]  prevent that kind of activity from happening so
[01:46:27.200 --> 01:46:30.480]  did golden sacks of jp morgan give qaddafi a waiver
[01:46:30.480 --> 01:46:33.680]  did the federal reserve of the treasury secretary tim geithner give qaddafi a
[01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:36.000]  waiver he didn't have to comply with the law
[01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:39.200]  why doesn't qaddafi have to comply with the law and everyone else does have to
[01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:42.800]  comply with the law what about tony blair wasn't he qaddafi's
[01:46:42.800 --> 01:46:46.640]  good friend just two or three years ago selling them arms getting cooking up
[01:46:46.640 --> 01:46:50.400]  blood for oil deals after the iraq uh fendango
[01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:54.000]  where's blair and all this i come 20 players not after supporting his friend
[01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:57.600]  colonel qaddafi it's under a lunacy and hypocrisy
[01:46:57.600 --> 01:47:02.160]  uh that's just like a few months ago it came out that one u.s bank alone
[01:47:02.160 --> 01:47:06.080]  laundered 360 plus billion dollars in mexican narcotics money
[01:47:06.080 --> 01:47:10.160]  and was even chartering the airplanes and owning the airplanes for them
[01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:13.760]  but the banks don't get in trouble for this
[01:47:13.760 --> 01:47:17.520]  exactly right so the banks are on a two-speed economy in a two-speed
[01:47:17.520 --> 01:47:19.680]  politics which is a cultocracy which is too
[01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:22.480]  ironical which is why americans should be revolting
[01:47:22.480 --> 01:47:25.600]  which is why there should be a million people crossing the brooklyn bridge and
[01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:29.200]  surrounding the federal reserve bank in new york and demanding the current fed
[01:47:29.200 --> 01:47:32.640]  head of the new york fed comes out that's right people shouldn't be i mean
[01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:36.240]  people always talk about marching washington's is is is where the
[01:47:36.240 --> 01:47:40.800]  castrated ceremonial puppets are if people are really going to march it be
[01:47:40.800 --> 01:47:43.920]  on the federal reserve bank of new york
[01:47:43.920 --> 01:47:46.480]  absolutely i mean that's where the dictatorship is
[01:47:46.480 --> 01:47:50.880]  revolutions work alex that's that's the my message from cairo egypt is that
[01:47:50.880 --> 01:47:54.720]  if it's a decentralized true organic people's revolution
[01:47:54.720 --> 01:47:58.720]  the establishment powers even if they're armed like uh these like these regimes
[01:47:58.720 --> 01:48:02.560]  are armed they can't do anything about it so the question to americans are
[01:48:02.560 --> 01:48:07.520]  what are you waiting for the time is now you're being held hostage by tyrants
[01:48:07.520 --> 01:48:11.360]  why are you letting people in this north africa in the middle east make you look
[01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:15.200]  like you like being in prison that you like being ruled over by tyrants what
[01:48:15.200 --> 01:48:19.360]  are you waiting for max looking at other areas the
[01:48:19.360 --> 01:48:23.440]  middle east the saudi king pumping out 37 million last week millions more this
[01:48:23.440 --> 01:48:26.400]  week uh tanks rolling around the streets there
[01:48:26.400 --> 01:48:29.680]  what's the feeling on the street in cairo is it that this revolution
[01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:32.960]  against the plutocrats and the corrupt royalty and the dictators is going to
[01:48:32.960 --> 01:48:35.920]  continue well it's definitely spreading you know
[01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:39.920]  outside of saudi arabia's berain and that has been very active
[01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:44.560]  and saudi arabia is the the king pain in the region there that
[01:48:44.560 --> 01:48:48.160]  you know there's three big players in the in the
[01:48:48.160 --> 01:48:51.680]  north africa in the middle east it's saudi resriel and it states
[01:48:51.680 --> 01:48:55.760]  and saudi arabian unrest is is percolating
[01:48:55.760 --> 01:48:59.440]  the the royal family is trying to buy off the people
[01:48:59.440 --> 01:49:03.520]  by giving by increasing their the amount of money they're giving them
[01:49:03.520 --> 01:49:07.360]  we see this happening in other regimes as well they're trying to buy the people
[01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:10.560]  off but the people at this point uh they're
[01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:13.920]  feeling that no money no amount of money could buy them off because they want to
[01:49:13.920 --> 01:49:17.360]  feel something more than money they want to feel integrity they want to feel
[01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:20.480]  like their life is worth something well that's the bigger issue is that in
[01:49:20.480 --> 01:49:24.800]  these corrupt swaggering police states people are tired of the arrogance and
[01:49:24.800 --> 01:49:28.720]  the abuse of the security forces and they always want it to go
[01:49:28.720 --> 01:49:32.000]  away and no amount of money by these arrogant
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:35.760]  bureaucracies whether it's here or in saudi arabia is going to assuage the
[01:49:35.760 --> 01:49:39.760]  people's rage no and in for when bush took off
[01:49:39.760 --> 01:49:43.360]  is back when he threw that election back in 2000 and
[01:49:43.360 --> 01:49:46.800]  again 2004 he sent every black america check for
[01:49:46.800 --> 01:49:50.400]  between 600 and 1200 dollars so he's mimicking these
[01:49:50.400 --> 01:49:55.040]  these middle east kings and rulers by giving the peasants a few dollars to
[01:49:55.040 --> 01:49:59.520]  shut them up i mean how outrageous is that i mean is that all the life in
[01:49:59.520 --> 01:50:03.280]  america is worth 600 bucks from bush the royal
[01:50:03.280 --> 01:50:08.560]  monarch i mean give yourself with some kind of self-respect
[01:50:09.280 --> 01:50:12.640]  max when we come back from break i want to get into
[01:50:12.640 --> 01:50:14.800]  more of what's happening in the middle east maybe keep you a little bit in the
[01:50:14.800 --> 01:50:19.120]  next hour if we can uh joining us again via video link from kairu

[01:54:32.160 --> 01:54:35.200]  about mortgage fraud we'll also talk about charlie sheen some
[01:54:35.200 --> 01:54:38.080]  i was in a meeting for an hour and a half last night with lenny and and and
[01:54:38.080 --> 01:54:40.800]  charlie we won't get into that private meeting the point is we're trying to
[01:54:40.800 --> 01:54:44.160]  help charlie out to navigate through all this stuff that's going on so that's
[01:54:44.160 --> 01:54:49.520]  coming up in about 10 minutes from now going back to max geyser max what do
[01:54:49.520 --> 01:54:52.720]  you make of the wall street journal coming out today and saying why the
[01:54:52.720 --> 01:54:56.800]  dollars reign is near an end the chinese
[01:54:56.800 --> 01:55:00.320]  have come out today and saying by the end of this year they want all trade all
[01:55:00.320 --> 01:55:04.960]  purchases of chinese goods to be in their currency
[01:55:04.960 --> 01:55:09.840]  uh why are they doing this now and how big is this
[01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:14.080]  well they're doing it now because there's no denying anymore they can't hide it
[01:55:14.080 --> 01:55:17.440]  anymore and it's everybody knows it
[01:55:17.440 --> 01:55:21.360]  um i mean this is no secret the dollar is no longer
[01:55:21.360 --> 01:55:25.920]  going to work as a world reserve currency anymore and we're moving toward a new
[01:55:25.920 --> 01:55:29.840]  global currency grid the dollar is going to play a lot
[01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:33.440]  less of a role the key to understand is that when the dollar
[01:55:33.440 --> 01:55:37.600]  time for the dollar to devalue comes it'll happen in one day
[01:55:37.600 --> 01:55:41.840]  and suddenly everything in america will cost two to three times more
[01:55:41.840 --> 01:55:45.200]  and america will you know the president will say well we had no choice
[01:55:45.200 --> 01:55:48.720]  and we have to devalue the dollar uh because it's going to help you or
[01:55:48.720 --> 01:55:52.560]  export market it's going to help you get jobs of course the other jobs that
[01:55:52.560 --> 01:55:56.080]  america will be qualified for at that point will be cotton kicking so you're
[01:55:56.080 --> 01:55:59.280]  going to have you know 20 million cotton pickers in america competing with
[01:55:59.280 --> 01:56:02.880]  cotton pickers around the world you know so this it's over this is the wall
[01:56:02.880 --> 01:56:06.400]  street journal which is is stating the obvious some point it's embarrassing
[01:56:06.400 --> 01:56:09.840]  for them to pretend like this is not the case i mean they have to
[01:56:09.840 --> 01:56:14.800]  at least recognize what's the obvious situation so they can't hide it anymore
[01:56:14.800 --> 01:56:18.240]  it's exactly what we've been saying on your show and it's why gold and silver
[01:56:18.240 --> 01:56:21.280]  hitting new highs they'll continue to hit new highs
[01:56:21.280 --> 01:56:24.640]  because the fiat currency regime and the u.s dollar
[01:56:24.640 --> 01:56:28.560]  period is finished it's that simple
[01:56:29.280 --> 01:56:33.840]  max but but the question is why have they gone from denying that this was a
[01:56:33.840 --> 01:56:37.680]  certainty mathematically with what they've done with the dollar globally
[01:56:37.680 --> 01:56:41.280]  to now saying yes it's coming
[01:56:41.360 --> 01:56:45.680]  well i think that they're now preparing to set up the new banking facilities
[01:56:45.680 --> 01:56:49.120]  because you know when the dollar crashes and it's replaced with another
[01:56:49.120 --> 01:56:52.480]  uh global currency of some type an expanded
[01:56:52.480 --> 01:56:56.400]  special drawing rights that's a huge piece of business for the banksters
[01:56:56.400 --> 01:57:00.160]  they will have to convert u.s dollars into sdr street bonds
[01:57:00.160 --> 01:57:03.760]  based on that member before davos they said they needed to trade a 100 trillion
[01:57:03.760 --> 01:57:07.520]  dollar new credit facility that's huge a fees for
[01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:11.520]  morgan and gulma sacks for the banksters so they're preparing for a huge
[01:57:11.520 --> 01:57:14.160]  piece of business and their christmas bonuses next year
[01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:17.520]  will be based on dismantling the dollar and rolling out the new
[01:57:17.520 --> 01:57:21.280]  the new currency so i would anticipate that within the next three to six months
[01:57:21.280 --> 01:57:24.800]  the wall street journal will introduce america to the new
[01:57:24.800 --> 01:57:29.840]  the new currency and how great it is and how everyone's going to love it and by
[01:57:29.840 --> 01:57:32.640]  the way the banks of wall street are going to make a huge killing
[01:57:32.640 --> 01:57:36.960]  in issuing bonds in this new currency and everything's going to be created in
[01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:39.920]  this new currency and it's going to be fantastic of course what they won't
[01:57:39.920 --> 01:57:45.440]  mention is that it's going to lower the purchasing power of americans by 50 to
[01:57:45.440 --> 01:57:48.720]  60 percent and america will officially be in the second
[01:57:48.720 --> 01:57:55.600]  world and making its way to the third world unless we finally kick the real
[01:57:55.600 --> 01:57:57.920]  government it's illegitimate but it's the government
[01:57:57.920 --> 01:58:02.080]  this banking cartel out of the country uh i mean it's
[01:58:02.080 --> 01:58:06.320]  is either us or them well alex

[02:00:37.280 --> 02:00:41.360]  uh ladies and gentlemen it is a mathematical certainty every economist
[02:00:41.360 --> 02:00:45.760]  we've had on for more than 12 years from george humphrey right through to
[02:00:45.760 --> 02:00:49.840]  webster tarpley has broken down that once they launch derivatives
[02:00:49.840 --> 02:00:53.520]  it's a mathematical certainty that if the bankers can tie us to their fraudulent
[02:00:53.520 --> 02:00:56.240]  debt it's over and they've tied the dollar
[02:00:56.240 --> 02:01:00.000]  to it and now they're reorganizing this new global sdr basket
[02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:04.320]  based in a new fiat system they control so they can buy up the planet through
[02:01:04.320 --> 02:01:06.800]  fraud as thomas jefferson said if we ever
[02:01:06.800 --> 02:01:09.600]  let private bankers control the issuance of currency and credit
[02:01:09.600 --> 02:01:13.600]  our children will wake up homeless on the connet their forefathers conquered

[02:01:16.720 --> 02:01:20.400]  um we better have a revolution of understanding
[02:01:20.400 --> 02:01:22.800]  you know egyptians knew the tyranny they were under
[02:01:22.800 --> 02:01:26.560]  uh people in triply knew the tyranny they were under in libya
[02:01:26.560 --> 02:01:29.680]  the average american still doesn't understand that the fellow reserves the
[02:01:29.680 --> 02:01:32.800]  enemy though we've gone from ron poll having one co-sponsor
[02:01:32.800 --> 02:01:36.720]  to being able to pass his audit the fed in the um house
[02:01:36.720 --> 02:01:41.440]  and though gallup polls and other show over 80 percent do want to abolish it
[02:01:41.440 --> 02:01:45.040]  people need to understand this is the number one issue
[02:01:45.040 --> 02:01:52.080]  people of caro trust it for him by somewhere people of caro listen to me
[02:01:52.080 --> 02:01:56.880]  oh sorry alps i was just trying to uh get my part of the revolution started
[02:01:56.880 --> 02:02:00.720]  uh yeah listen uh i was just listening to that commercial for diamond gusset
[02:02:00.720 --> 02:02:03.840]  jeans about some people that are america crying
[02:02:03.840 --> 02:02:06.320]  woo hoo ha ha ha ha america's finished
[02:02:06.320 --> 02:02:10.080]  ha ha ha ha meanwhile the people of caro are dancing in the streets
[02:02:10.080 --> 02:02:13.440]  because they just changed the successful revolution they're dancing here
[02:02:13.440 --> 02:02:17.520]  they're happy they're full of pride and integrity that they go through a
[02:02:17.520 --> 02:02:21.520]  dictator stop crying stop whining stop being a big
[02:02:21.520 --> 02:02:25.200]  freaking baby revolt you must revolt now or you're
[02:02:25.200 --> 02:02:28.560]  going to be in prison in the prison planet
[02:02:28.560 --> 02:02:34.080]  you must do it now uh you're calling for revolt you mean peaceful mass
[02:02:34.080 --> 02:02:36.960]  demonstration kind of like what they're doing in wisconsin
[02:02:36.960 --> 02:02:41.280]  taking over the capital well wisconsin's a great example of people
[02:02:41.280 --> 02:02:44.720]  i think the people in wisconsin don't fully
[02:02:44.720 --> 02:02:48.160]  understand the issues that are at stake because they're
[02:02:48.160 --> 02:02:51.520]  they're they're defining their issues and that right that's fake
[02:02:51.520 --> 02:02:55.360]  left paradigm that you talk about all the time i think they need to understand
[02:02:55.360 --> 02:02:59.040]  that everyone in wisconsin's a loser if scott
[02:02:59.040 --> 02:03:01.360]  walker who's a representative of the banking
[02:03:01.360 --> 02:03:07.600]  kleptocracy and the coke brothers kleptocracy if he wins everybody loses
[02:03:07.600 --> 02:03:11.440]  nobody wins if he wins so they have to understand that mentality and they're
[02:03:11.440 --> 02:03:14.720]  right to march on the uh capital building seven thousand people did
[02:03:14.720 --> 02:03:20.480]  that's spreading to ohio i say from ohio to caro from ohio to caro let freedom
[02:03:20.480 --> 02:03:25.120]  ring and when it's a peaceful revolution we saw it here you don't need to be
[02:03:25.120 --> 02:03:28.800]  wildly uprising you don't even need a leader all you need is an idea
[02:03:28.800 --> 02:03:32.800]  let that idea percolate on the social networks and act on that idea
[02:03:32.800 --> 02:03:36.240]  literally it happened overnight here alice in caro i was talking to a guy
[02:03:36.240 --> 02:03:38.880]  interviewing from our show today he said one day
[02:03:38.880 --> 02:03:42.800]  we were playing video games on the internet and didn't think

[02:07:09.680 --> 02:07:12.640]  agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath
[02:07:12.640 --> 02:07:15.840]  americans at home i've turned a tremendous influence
[02:07:15.840 --> 02:07:19.840]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots
[02:07:19.840 --> 02:07:25.040]  i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[02:07:25.040 --> 02:07:29.040]  full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[02:07:29.040 --> 02:07:32.720]  offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[02:07:32.720 --> 02:07:36.000]  and on its ashes constructing world government tim geithner
[02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:39.040]  Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more matches
[02:07:39.040 --> 02:07:42.400]  and the congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like
[02:07:42.400 --> 02:07:45.920]  nobody does care and right now in washington dc
[02:07:45.920 --> 02:07:51.120]  we have seen a fall of the republic yet your copy of full of the republic on

[02:08:00.720 --> 02:08:14.800]  of enemy propaganda rolling across the picket line
[02:08:14.800 --> 02:08:19.120]  lay down gi lay down gi we saw it all through the 20th century
[02:08:19.120 --> 02:08:22.480]  and now in the 21st century it's time to stand up and realize
[02:08:22.480 --> 02:08:25.680]  that we should not allow ourselves to be crammed into this rat maze
[02:08:25.680 --> 02:08:30.400]  we should not submit to dehumanization i don't know about you but i'm concerned
[02:08:30.400 --> 02:08:33.760]  with what's happening in this world i'm concerned with the structure
[02:08:33.760 --> 02:08:37.600]  i'm concerned with the systems of control those that control my life and
[02:08:37.600 --> 02:08:41.600]  those that seek to control it even more i want freedom
[02:08:41.600 --> 02:08:44.400]  that's what i want and that's what you should want
[02:08:44.400 --> 02:08:47.840]  it's up to each and every one of us to turn this into just some of the greedy
[02:08:47.840 --> 02:08:50.960]  the hatred the envy and yes the insecurities
[02:08:50.960 --> 02:08:54.960]  because that is the central mode of control make us feel pathetic small
[02:08:54.960 --> 02:08:58.800]  so we'll willingly give up our sovereignty our liberty
[02:08:58.800 --> 02:09:03.040]  our destiny we have got to realize that we're being conditioned
[02:09:03.040 --> 02:09:07.280]  on a mass scale start challenging this corporate slave state
[02:09:07.280 --> 02:09:11.600]  the 21st century is going to be a new century not the century of slavery
[02:09:11.600 --> 02:09:14.480]  not the century of lies and the notion of giving us
[02:09:14.480 --> 02:09:18.880]  and classism and stateism and all the rest of the modes of control
[02:09:18.880 --> 02:09:22.640]  it's going to be the age of humankind standing up for something pure and
[02:09:22.640 --> 02:09:25.600]  something right what a bunch of garbage liberal
[02:09:25.600 --> 02:09:29.200]  democrat conservative republican it's all there to control
[02:09:29.200 --> 02:09:32.720]  in two sides of the same coin two management teams
[02:09:32.720 --> 02:09:36.800]  getting for control the ceo job of slavery incorporated
[02:09:36.800 --> 02:09:40.800]  the truth is out there in front of you but they lay out this buffet of lies
[02:09:40.800 --> 02:09:44.720]  i'm sick of it and i'm not going to take a bite out of it do you got me
[02:09:44.720 --> 02:09:48.400]  let's just let's just stop here
[02:09:48.400 --> 02:09:51.600]  humankind is too good we're not a bunch of underachievers
[02:09:51.600 --> 02:09:56.400]  we're going to stand up and we're going to be human beings we're not real things
[02:09:56.400 --> 02:10:00.560]  the things that matter creativity and the dynamic human spirit
[02:10:00.560 --> 02:10:04.480]  that refuses to submit well that's it that's all i've got to say
[02:10:04.480 --> 02:10:07.360]  it's in your court
[02:10:12.960 --> 02:10:17.680]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide
[02:10:17.680 --> 02:10:26.880]  it's alex jones
[02:10:26.880 --> 02:10:31.120]  monday through friday from 11 a.m to 2 p.m central standard time
[02:10:31.120 --> 02:10:36.240]  we are here live and i tell you i knew about him as being one of the most
[02:10:36.240 --> 02:10:41.680]  powerful sluggers ever in baseball and i'd also seen him in the news a few years
[02:10:41.680 --> 02:10:45.040]  ago as you know this fabulous investor and a lot of analysts saying he was the
[02:10:45.040 --> 02:10:49.120]  best out there for an individual then i saw the supposed fall of lennie
[02:10:49.120 --> 02:10:51.680]  dykstra like so many other companies at the banks
[02:10:51.680 --> 02:10:55.600]  basically manipulated and cheated and i had a chance to spend a lot of time with
[02:10:55.600 --> 02:10:59.680]  him when i was out in los angeles a few weeks ago and he was on with us for that
[02:10:59.680 --> 02:11:04.880]  epic off the charts off the rails interview with charlie
[02:11:04.880 --> 02:11:07.840]  sheen last week that lennie or i did not know was going to happen
[02:11:07.840 --> 02:11:11.840]  we were going to get him charlie on to talk about how he was clean we witnessed
[02:11:11.840 --> 02:11:14.960]  him with the nurse they're doing the urine test
[02:11:14.960 --> 02:11:19.360]  blood test you name it how proud of him we were but he was mad about
[02:11:19.360 --> 02:11:22.960]  some of the executives demonizing him and attacking him while he was down
[02:11:22.960 --> 02:11:25.760]  and it's obviously the biggest story in the world right now and
[02:11:25.760 --> 02:11:29.280]  without getting into any any details i had a nice hour and a half
[02:11:29.280 --> 02:11:34.160]  discussion with charlie sheen and lennie via charlie's office last night the
[02:11:34.160 --> 02:11:37.040]  media keeps asking me to comment on charlie i haven't been
[02:11:37.040 --> 02:11:41.120]  or give them inside information i have all the inside information because i
[02:11:41.120 --> 02:11:44.240]  don't talk about it charlie is my friend i know him as a loving
[02:11:44.240 --> 02:11:48.400]  compassionate really smart guy who's been totally clean for the previous six
[02:11:48.400 --> 02:11:52.080]  plus years i knew him went off the rails a little bit got wild
[02:11:52.080 --> 02:11:56.080]  now he's got the endorphins flowing the the media calls it mania
[02:11:56.080 --> 02:12:00.160]  i call it normal when you kick you know serious substance use
[02:12:00.160 --> 02:12:06.160]  by yourself no prescription drugs no nothing he's off everything except life
[02:12:06.160 --> 02:12:10.320]  but i wanted to originally get lennie on but then we got into the sheen thing
[02:12:10.320 --> 02:12:12.880]  because he was going to be part two of the interview
[02:12:12.880 --> 02:12:16.400]  dealing with the fact that i remember four or five months ago
[02:12:16.400 --> 02:12:20.400]  hearing everybody in the community and lawyers and uh that were in the
[02:12:20.400 --> 02:12:22.960]  wall street journal in usa today that we got on
[02:12:22.960 --> 02:12:27.440]  who were beating banks in florida and connecticut new york and california
[02:12:27.440 --> 02:12:31.840]  they were mentioning lennie dystra and the big case with jp morgan
[02:12:31.840 --> 02:12:35.840]  and and and and how he'd won and how this was devastating to the bankers
[02:12:35.840 --> 02:12:38.800]  i was when lennie dystra lennie dystra that's that guy that
[02:12:38.800 --> 02:12:42.800]  they said went belly up or whatever that's that famous baseball player
[02:12:42.800 --> 02:12:47.040]  and then boom i'm at charlie's house in comes through the door to eat swordfish
[02:12:47.040 --> 02:12:51.680]  with us at dinner is lennie dystra talked to the guy for like eight hours
[02:12:51.680 --> 02:12:55.520]  you know from like five in the afternoon or whatever until two three in the
[02:12:55.520 --> 02:12:59.040]  morning when he left and really came off as
[02:12:59.040 --> 02:13:02.880]  a very interesting and genuine person and lennie was blown away because for
[02:13:02.880 --> 02:13:06.960]  about two hours we sat around charlie's kitchen island
[02:13:06.960 --> 02:13:11.520]  standing up looking at his court cases looking at his 200 plus wins against
[02:13:11.520 --> 02:13:16.240]  the sec which nobody's ever done i mean mark cuban beat him once and they
[02:13:16.240 --> 02:13:20.800]  came back at him uh and seeing and and and lennie was
[02:13:20.800 --> 02:13:23.920]  blown away because he's like wow who is this guy he knows all about
[02:13:23.920 --> 02:13:28.160]  the bank fraud and the mirrors and how lennie had all these houses and all
[02:13:28.160 --> 02:13:31.440]  this property was doing great and they suddenly called it all in on him
[02:13:31.440 --> 02:13:35.760]  as they've done to so many others and so
[02:13:35.760 --> 02:13:39.040]  i wanted to get lennie on specifically about
[02:13:39.040 --> 02:13:42.720]  that today of course for those that don't know who lennie dystra is
[02:13:42.720 --> 02:13:49.600]  he's not only an entrepreneur he was a three-time most valuable
[02:13:49.600 --> 02:13:54.640]  all-star selection world series champion 1986
[02:13:54.640 --> 02:14:00.640]  the silver slugger winner 1993 known in the baseball uh sites that i've
[02:14:00.640 --> 02:14:04.880]  looked at as one of the hardest players ever and that's a guy who'd run full
[02:14:04.880 --> 02:14:08.720]  speed right on the wall to catch a pitch and i tell you he's been in charlie's
[02:14:08.720 --> 02:14:14.080]  corner behind the scenes trying to uh you know cool things down a
[02:14:14.080 --> 02:14:17.200]  little bit uh with everything that's happening and i'm
[02:14:17.200 --> 02:14:21.360]  telling you it's we're all blessed to have lennie dystra here today but i
[02:14:21.360 --> 02:14:24.320]  tell you you're an amazing guy lennie i mean i don't get on air and tell folks
[02:14:24.320 --> 02:14:27.440]  i like somebody unless i really as george bush would say look
[02:14:27.440 --> 02:14:31.600]  into their soul but you are an awesome guy and an awesome friend to charlie
[02:14:31.600 --> 02:14:35.120]  and now i count you as a friend we now talk every day on the phone i mean
[02:14:35.120 --> 02:14:38.000]  where were you my whole life lennie
[02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:42.080]  well i'm glad to be on on the winning team now
[02:14:42.080 --> 02:14:45.520]  well i'm i usually i'm actually always on the winning team but
[02:14:45.520 --> 02:14:50.480]  hey listen i appreciate you having me on and um again all the things that you
[02:14:50.480 --> 02:14:54.720]  did say about charlie sheen are correct charlie sheen
[02:14:54.720 --> 02:15:00.000]  he's an amazing person he's a he's a he's an individual that speaks the truth
[02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:04.800]  and and now now hopefully things will come full circle and and
[02:15:04.800 --> 02:15:08.080]  all the fans will get what they want and that is to see charlie
[02:15:08.080 --> 02:15:11.200]  let's not forget what this is about this is about him entertaining this
[02:15:11.200 --> 02:15:14.560]  country with his talent and then he's one of the best or
[02:15:14.560 --> 02:15:18.400]  probably the best at what he does right now and so so i think they're all
[02:15:18.400 --> 02:15:21.760]  smart enough to realize that and this will hopefully all
[02:15:21.760 --> 02:15:25.360]  have a happy ending here and that's what america wants and that's what america
[02:15:25.360 --> 02:15:27.920]  deserves yeah i don't want to say too much but
[02:15:27.920 --> 02:15:35.520]  there may be some really positive uh row ending events coming up very soon
[02:15:35.520 --> 02:15:39.680]  yeah they possibly could you know i mean but charlie's
[02:15:39.680 --> 02:15:45.280]  charlie right now is is is a guy that it's probably the the single
[02:15:45.280 --> 02:15:50.000]  hottest um human on the planet i mean i think he
[02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:54.640]  he started a twitter account which i think is your idea by the way uh
[02:15:54.640 --> 02:15:58.880]  alex and uh and i think he went went through the rails and then hit over a
[02:15:58.880 --> 02:16:02.160]  million people on his first day day out yeah it's a million and a half
[02:16:02.160 --> 02:16:05.440]  right now in a day and a half yeah it's now in the Guinness Book of World
[02:16:05.440 --> 02:16:08.320]  Records yeah it's going to be so alex that means you should be in the
[02:16:08.320 --> 02:16:11.600]  Guinness book with him because that was your idea
[02:16:11.600 --> 02:16:16.160]  um so so uh anyways i'm going for ideas from you to tell me how to get the
[02:16:16.160 --> 02:16:19.520]  Guinness book world records well i've got another idea that if charlie
[02:16:19.520 --> 02:16:22.160]  does it'll be even bigger but but we'll see i don't want to i don't want to
[02:16:22.160 --> 02:16:25.920]  push him too hard but he's certainly doing a great job on that front now
[02:16:25.920 --> 02:16:29.440]  uh people want to hear about charlie a little bit we're going to go to break
[02:16:29.440 --> 02:16:32.240]  here in a minute and then and then finish talking about that and and get
[02:16:32.240 --> 02:16:35.680]  into your uh you've got a great old website showing
[02:16:35.680 --> 02:16:39.920]  in the last year your defeat of jp morgan your defeat of the sec the actual
[02:16:39.920 --> 02:16:42.160]  documents you're opening your life up to everybody
[02:16:42.160 --> 02:16:46.000]  you're showing people how that you beat them and it's exactly what other
[02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:49.360]  lawyers i've had on who've been beating them have said
[02:16:49.360 --> 02:16:53.600]  and that's what's really you're at the heart of causing mortgage gate
[02:16:53.600 --> 02:16:56.720]  where they set you up you're now exposing it we're going to talk about that but
[02:16:56.720 --> 02:17:00.400]  without getting into too much about what we talked about last night with charlie
[02:17:00.400 --> 02:17:03.360]  and an hour and a half discussion when i knew him
[02:17:03.360 --> 02:17:07.440]  he was focused smart but now he really is unchained
[02:17:07.440 --> 02:17:11.040]  and and he mainly jokes around in those interviews and people take it serious
[02:17:11.040 --> 02:17:14.080]  but in person last night he was like a laser beam
[02:17:14.080 --> 02:17:17.920]  and every idea we had he was already a couple of a couple of steps
[02:17:17.920 --> 02:17:22.960]  uh uh uh past us but again folks uh well there's some i'm obviously we just can't
[02:17:22.960 --> 02:17:25.840]  talk about it we know basically everything but we can't talk about it
[02:17:25.840 --> 02:17:29.200]  and i wish we could but we're going to see what happens
[02:17:29.200 --> 02:17:32.800]  sounds good i mean i i mean is there anything we can talk about i guess we
[02:17:32.800 --> 02:17:37.200]  really should look the thing we can talk about is the first thing is is um
[02:17:37.200 --> 02:17:40.960]  i got hit by a lot of bitches but but not that many so living name my website
[02:17:40.960 --> 02:17:47.120]  it's stop the greedy banks dot com um and then so everybody could kind of
[02:17:47.120 --> 02:17:51.440]  know uh last time i was on the the domain name was a little bit different
[02:17:51.440 --> 02:17:57.760]  so yeah alex helped help me uh uh again and that's uh again stop the greedy
[02:17:57.760 --> 02:18:01.920]  banks dot com but the bottom line is with charlie here's a deal
[02:18:01.920 --> 02:18:07.600]  the deal is um at the end of the day uh somebody's got to win somebody's got to
[02:18:07.600 --> 02:18:10.720]  lose so so charlie talks about winning
[02:18:10.720 --> 02:18:14.400]  all the time he's a winner so so that's what's gonna happen
[02:18:14.400 --> 02:18:17.920]  if there's only thing i could tell you that's gonna happen is that if he wins
[02:18:17.920 --> 02:18:22.480]  then america wins okay and the bottom line is like you said alex i mean
[02:18:22.480 --> 02:18:26.400]  you had him on the show and you know charlie wanted to
[02:18:26.400 --> 02:18:31.440]  say say say his piece and he did but but again now everything comes full circle
[02:18:31.440 --> 02:18:34.320]  it's time to get back to work and i think charlie's smart enough that i
[02:18:34.320 --> 02:18:37.840]  realized that uh in fact i know he's smart enough because
[02:18:37.840 --> 02:18:41.120]  i was with him all day yesterday and uh he's a genuine
[02:18:41.120 --> 02:18:45.680]  dear friend not only to me but but to you and he's the kind of friend that you
[02:18:45.680 --> 02:18:49.200]  can count on your your hand if you don't have any of those that are loyal
[02:18:49.200 --> 02:18:53.360]  so so anyway without further ado let's go to your break but i'll just
[02:18:53.360 --> 02:18:56.720]  point out again there should be some positive stuff happening
[02:18:56.720 --> 02:19:00.080]  um here in the future very near future in fact
[02:19:00.080 --> 02:19:04.000]  and and why wouldn't there be i mean it's a win win for everybody and then
[02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:07.360]  that at the end of the day that's what all the results are what matters winning
[02:19:07.360 --> 02:19:10.960]  okay that's what the key is well plus he stood up against the whole
[02:19:10.960 --> 02:19:15.680]  hollywood system and if he loses it hurts everybody standing up
[02:19:15.680 --> 02:19:18.640]  against this system there are a lot of other big hollywood people thinking
[02:19:18.640 --> 02:19:21.760]  about going political and coming out of their shells
[02:19:21.760 --> 02:19:26.400]  and and and so a lot is riding on this but i want to get back to your website
[02:19:26.400 --> 02:19:30.320]  and we're going to put it up on screen as we go to break it's a beautiful website

[02:24:32.800 --> 02:24:37.120]  after I play this clip to your laptop open because
[02:24:37.120 --> 02:24:40.960]  I wanted to see the information Charlie and I and you for
[02:24:40.960 --> 02:24:44.160]  for for two hours of that eight hour meeting or whatever it was

[02:24:57.040 --> 02:25:01.120]  years ago before the banks shut him down here's what
[02:25:01.120 --> 02:25:05.120]  the national news and jim kramer had to say about his stock picks which
[02:25:05.120 --> 02:25:09.360]  the scoreboard doesn't lie he was making great picks here it is
[02:25:09.360 --> 02:25:14.160]  and just in case you're thinking that nobody who sounds like yogi bearer
[02:25:14.160 --> 02:25:17.600]  can be that successful in the world of high finance
[02:25:17.600 --> 02:25:21.200]  don't take my word for it I think people don't think of Lenny
[02:25:21.200 --> 02:25:24.320]  as sophisticated but I am telling you Bernie
[02:25:24.320 --> 02:25:27.840]  that not only is he sophisticated but he's one of the great ones

[02:25:52.320 --> 02:25:54.400]  banks did to you and then when we come back
[02:25:54.400 --> 02:25:57.760]  you're the underdog came from nowhere is this top slugger
[02:25:57.760 --> 02:26:01.200]  underdog doing great in the stock market then they shut you down
[02:26:01.200 --> 02:26:04.720]  now you're back beating him in court the underdog winning again rising like the
[02:26:04.720 --> 02:26:08.240]  phoenix well let me just make some clear
[02:26:08.240 --> 02:26:11.920]  Jim Kramer is the only one that's been right by the way
[02:26:11.920 --> 02:26:15.200]  I'm still going live my nails investments.com
[02:26:15.200 --> 02:26:20.720]  I'm now 205 and oh okay that that that website that that company that I have
[02:26:20.720 --> 02:26:24.320]  where I help people make money through through stock picks
[02:26:24.320 --> 02:26:27.920]  is still going today okay I didn't get stupid overnight
[02:26:27.920 --> 02:26:34.080]  okay bottom line is I got I got put in a situation where I was set up to fail
[02:26:34.080 --> 02:26:37.200]  by JP Morgan okay and at the end of the day
[02:26:37.200 --> 02:26:40.880]  when they want you to fail it's called equity stripping it's called predatory
[02:26:40.880 --> 02:26:44.560]  learning whatever you want to call it you can't be them okay
[02:26:44.560 --> 02:26:48.080]  I didn't get stupid overnight okay I did not get stupid overnight when they
[02:26:48.080 --> 02:26:51.840]  promise you one thing and do another then that's a problem
[02:26:51.840 --> 02:26:55.120]  well in a nutshell describe how you went from the top of the world to being in
[02:26:55.120 --> 02:26:59.120]  trouble now you're back it's very simple when they tell me
[02:26:59.120 --> 02:27:02.320]  well here's a deal let me let me in a nutshell
[02:27:02.320 --> 02:27:06.960]  I tell them I have 125,000 a month coming in from from cash flow that I
[02:27:06.960 --> 02:27:10.560]  sold my car washes and had a 10-year cash flow
[02:27:10.560 --> 02:27:14.960]  you made 54 million off the car washes right right that was carrying some paper
[02:27:14.960 --> 02:27:18.960]  and I took some interest on the note to pay me 125,000 a month
[02:27:18.960 --> 02:27:23.440]  and then again not that smart of a guy but smart enough to know if I got 125
[02:27:23.440 --> 02:27:26.560]  and I tell him I got a $50,000 nut on one house
[02:27:26.560 --> 02:27:30.720]  there's 75 left well I don't want to go up to that 75 I want to tell me if you
[02:27:30.720 --> 02:27:34.800]  bring me a loan back for $49,000 as a payment
[02:27:34.800 --> 02:27:39.360]  no money down and then we can do business well guess what I show up at escrow
[02:27:39.360 --> 02:27:42.800]  they change all the deals they tell me how they're going to refind me the same
[02:27:42.800 --> 02:27:45.920]  stuff people don't want to hear a long story the bottom line is no we've no
[02:27:45.920 --> 02:27:48.560]  people need to hear how they do it because you've now beaten them in court
[02:27:48.560 --> 02:27:51.760]  well here's how they do it they set you up to fail
[02:27:51.760 --> 02:27:56.640]  it's called predatory lending at its finest it's gone it's gone so far now
[02:27:56.640 --> 02:27:59.840]  that that I now can show people I can show
[02:27:59.840 --> 02:28:03.840]  the american families out there that are walking around in a pending doom
[02:28:03.840 --> 02:28:06.800]  I mean if anybody all the people out there listening
[02:28:06.800 --> 02:28:10.320]  I know what they feel like I know what it's like when you're walking around
[02:28:10.320 --> 02:28:14.240]  with no where to turn no where to go well I now have a solution I now have a
[02:28:14.240 --> 02:28:17.280]  remedy where you can go in and seek recruitment
[02:28:17.280 --> 02:28:20.720]  and then lessen and lessen the defeat by by these bankers
[02:28:20.720 --> 02:28:24.640]  because once they file a proof of claim you now are on defense they take the
[02:28:24.640 --> 02:28:28.320]  offensive mode and the bottom line is is through tila
[02:28:28.320 --> 02:28:32.640]  through respa and and and hopa the bottom line is it's very simple
[02:28:32.640 --> 02:28:35.840]  they're set off claims if they didn't do everything right if they didn't qualify
[02:28:35.840 --> 02:28:39.360]  you under federal law they have a fiduciary duty to do so
[02:28:39.360 --> 02:28:42.880]  if they didn't do everything perfect then you have claims and you have
[02:28:42.880 --> 02:28:46.800]  you have real you have real options to get your house back
[02:28:46.800 --> 02:28:50.320]  or to get to the left side of these feeding recover money
[02:28:50.320 --> 02:28:54.800]  period in the story and we're going to walk through that when we come back
[02:28:54.800 --> 02:28:58.480]  from bright because on your website stopthegreedybanks.com
[02:28:58.480 --> 02:29:01.600]  one word stopthegreedybanks.com I spent hours
[02:29:01.600 --> 02:29:05.040]  and hours when I got back you've got all the court cases the documents
[02:29:05.040 --> 02:29:08.640]  we're going to break here in a moment but tell them about how the the latest
[02:29:08.640 --> 02:29:12.160]  case where you beat J.P. Morgan showing how they didn't do things right in the
[02:29:12.160 --> 02:29:15.200]  loan well I mean with J.P. Morgan I have a great
[02:29:15.200 --> 02:29:18.400]  attorney his name is Moser Moore and they're out of New York
[02:29:18.400 --> 02:29:22.800]  and he's one of the attorneys that what we do is once we find that the loan's
[02:29:22.800 --> 02:29:26.240]  predatory okay we send them up to the attorneys
[02:29:26.240 --> 02:29:29.360]  and then here's the deal at the end of the day the banks
[02:29:29.360 --> 02:29:32.560]  do not want to foreclose on homes you know why
[02:29:32.560 --> 02:29:36.000]  they get reimbursed anyway so so at the end of the day
[02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:40.560]  what we want to do is show people how they can get their home safe we can save
[02:29:40.560 --> 02:29:43.440]  people all right stay there let's talk about your specific case beating them
[02:29:43.440 --> 02:29:45.840]  though because it's on record now it's been in the LA Times

[02:33:30.160 --> 02:33:33.200]  we've had on the show randy kelton
[02:33:33.200 --> 02:33:38.240]  who's a pro se litigant like nails are saying the same thing and that now
[02:33:38.240 --> 02:33:41.280]  they've gone from a few years ago saying we're not robo signing
[02:33:41.280 --> 02:33:44.400]  we're not changing documents on you you don't know about we're not overcharging
[02:33:44.400 --> 02:33:48.000]  your fees we're not giving you loans you know designed to fail
[02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:51.360]  now it's admitted they have but but i mean let me tell us about the court case
[02:33:51.360 --> 02:33:55.600]  with jp morgan how you've beaten them in court specifically and some of the
[02:33:55.600 --> 02:34:02.000]  tricks that the big banks engage in well here it is in a it's it's really
[02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:06.320]  really um something that again i'm a normal guy
[02:34:06.320 --> 02:34:10.240]  okay i played baseball by the grace of god i was able to hit a ball where people
[02:34:10.240 --> 02:34:14.000]  weren't standing and make millions of dollars that being said
[02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:17.840]  i was able to carry that over and understand that once you're done playing
[02:34:17.840 --> 02:34:21.760]  if you don't have a paycheck if you don't have guaranteed recurring cash flow
[02:34:21.760 --> 02:34:26.960]  then you're going to have a problem that being said um i had a lot of success so
[02:34:26.960 --> 02:34:31.600]  the car wash has made some money and wing gretzky who everyone knows
[02:34:31.600 --> 02:34:35.360]  um a home for sale a home that i watched him build one of the probably the most
[02:34:35.360 --> 02:34:39.040]  beautiful homes in the in the in the country and and so when i had an
[02:34:39.040 --> 02:34:42.640]  opportunity to buy this home i wanted to buy this home at a certain price
[02:34:42.640 --> 02:34:45.920]  because again i you know i put down the number here's the
[02:34:45.920 --> 02:34:48.400]  number i have available here's where i have to spend
[02:34:48.400 --> 02:34:52.720]  bank comes back and says we can do it we can get you this loan for this amount
[02:34:52.720 --> 02:34:56.880]  it's a bigger payment okay all good show padesco
[02:34:56.880 --> 02:35:00.000]  they have a song and dance they tell me how they can
[02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:04.080]  refi me into another loan they give me half the amount of money they say but
[02:35:04.080 --> 02:35:08.160]  we have the other half lined up over here you'll have to make one payment
[02:35:08.160 --> 02:35:11.760]  we'll refi you in the same product the bottom line is it doesn't matter how you
[02:35:11.760 --> 02:35:15.840]  get to it it's it's set up from the beginning they set you up to fail
[02:35:15.840 --> 02:35:19.520]  okay and again you're talking about a guy that didn't believe in in corporate
[02:35:19.520 --> 02:35:22.160]  crime i never even thought there was such a thing but
[02:35:22.160 --> 02:35:25.680]  not only do i now know there's such a thing i live through it okay
[02:35:25.680 --> 02:35:28.880]  these people tried to kill me and when i say try to kill me
[02:35:28.880 --> 02:35:34.560]  jp morgan literally got in bed with the trustee and a trustee is somebody
[02:35:34.560 --> 02:35:38.160]  that handles a bankruptcy case and that's another story
[02:35:38.160 --> 02:35:44.240]  but gotten dead with him and hired him as their lawyer in 300 new cases
[02:35:44.240 --> 02:35:49.280]  now that trustee is no longer with us i'm the first guy to make a trustee
[02:35:49.280 --> 02:35:53.120]  resign in 35 years okay he didn't resign because he wanted a
[02:35:53.120 --> 02:35:56.320]  long vacation he resigned because he broke the law
[02:35:56.320 --> 02:35:59.920]  and i caught him okay and jp morgan's been caught too
[02:35:59.920 --> 02:36:04.320]  their own expert their own expert not only said my loan was predatory
[02:36:04.320 --> 02:36:08.560]  it was unconscionable okay so when you have a dti at debt
[02:36:08.560 --> 02:36:14.560]  to income of 150 percent okay that doesn't work the bottom line is
[02:36:14.560 --> 02:36:18.960]  they set you up to fail it's equity stripping it's it's predatory lending
[02:36:18.960 --> 02:36:22.640]  anything that you want to define it as these things
[02:36:22.640 --> 02:36:26.080]  are just pushing paper around but you also got into
[02:36:26.080 --> 02:36:31.040]  the mirrors and how they're not even filing uh deeds and things now where
[02:36:31.040 --> 02:36:34.960]  it's on record it they've sold the derivatives to hundreds of
[02:36:34.960 --> 02:36:39.200]  different people uh you go into the fees they charge you that
[02:36:39.200 --> 02:36:42.000]  they're with the truth and lending statement they're not supposed to
[02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:47.600]  this is why they're losing in court well mirrors mirrors there's no mirrors
[02:36:47.600 --> 02:36:51.520]  mirrors is done okay that's a joke in and of itself
[02:36:51.520 --> 02:36:55.360]  the issue now and you're right on point there alex the issue now is standing
[02:36:55.360 --> 02:36:59.360]  okay the issue now is standing how do they come into court how do they come
[02:36:59.360 --> 02:37:02.720]  into court and prove they own your loan and they don't have the deed
[02:37:02.720 --> 02:37:06.560]  that's exactly right there there has to be a trustee transfer
[02:37:06.560 --> 02:37:10.320]  what they were doing was rubber stamping these things now when you go back in
[02:37:10.320 --> 02:37:14.160]  any do not only a forensic audit but but you now do
[02:37:14.160 --> 02:37:18.080]  an audit that's a security a securitization audit
[02:37:18.080 --> 02:37:22.880]  that shows everything and they cannot prove that that loan was legally
[02:37:22.880 --> 02:37:27.280]  transferred or bought by the other bank that that puts them in a position of
[02:37:27.280 --> 02:37:31.360]  no standing okay and the banks now are losing in court
[02:37:31.360 --> 02:37:34.560]  and they'll continue to lose because what i'm doing right now
[02:37:34.560 --> 02:37:38.560]  is if you go on the internet and read about me you might i'm like the
[02:37:38.560 --> 02:37:42.800]  i'm like some villain i'm like a tax murderer oh yeah they love to talk about
[02:37:42.800 --> 02:37:45.520]  when you were supposedly in trouble but the fact that you're winning against
[02:37:45.520 --> 02:37:49.680]  jp morgan in court winning against the sec there's there's no
[02:37:49.680 --> 02:37:53.680]  news on that except for the little footnotes the sec
[02:37:53.680 --> 02:37:58.160]  probably the most powerful government organization in the world
[02:37:58.160 --> 02:38:02.400]  told me they were going to put me in jail okay they said no way you can be 100
[02:38:02.400 --> 02:38:06.400]  some and oh um picking these socks and i said
[02:38:06.400 --> 02:38:10.640]  you want to investigate me go at it they did 10 months later
[02:38:10.640 --> 02:38:15.040]  10 months later i have a letter and it's a letter that i keep in front of me
[02:38:15.040 --> 02:38:18.720]  everything i look at it and it says mr. dexter has done
[02:38:18.720 --> 02:38:22.400]  nothing wrong okay at the end to sum it up so
[02:38:22.400 --> 02:38:26.720]  yes they tried they tried to take me down this is all part of the banking
[02:38:26.720 --> 02:38:30.720]  system this is all they're all one group who tried to basically
[02:38:30.720 --> 02:38:34.560]  eliminate me off this planet okay and like i told them
[02:38:34.560 --> 02:38:38.800]  i told them i went into that courtroom and all the big all these bankruptcy
[02:38:38.800 --> 02:38:42.080]  attorneys because remember let me let me make some clear
[02:38:42.080 --> 02:38:46.480]  i filed a chapter 11 alex reorganization
[02:38:46.480 --> 02:38:50.240]  which jonathan's filed one six times many famous people
[02:38:50.240 --> 02:38:54.160]  filed a chapter 11 two weeks into my 11
[02:38:54.160 --> 02:38:59.120]  i was converted illegally to a seven because fireman's fund
[02:38:59.120 --> 02:39:03.200]  the insurance company illegally canceled my insurance
[02:39:03.200 --> 02:39:07.680]  okay when they canceled my insurance that they violated the automatic stay
[02:39:07.680 --> 02:39:11.280]  the automatic stay means that they can't do nothing without permission from the
[02:39:11.280 --> 02:39:14.480]  court so out of nowhere here i am with a hundred million
[02:39:14.480 --> 02:39:18.560]  dollars in assets spun into a chapter seven which i don't
[02:39:18.560 --> 02:39:22.160]  even know what a chapter seven is i'm in an 11 i have a way to
[02:39:22.160 --> 02:39:25.680]  a chapter seven lets them take control of you and do whatever they want
[02:39:25.680 --> 02:39:30.240]  and and and bingo was his name because they did try to take control of me
[02:39:30.240 --> 02:39:36.080]  and what they did is so far they've built me a million dollars i paid them a
[02:39:36.080 --> 02:39:40.400]  million dollars in fees and my estate is went backwards
[02:39:40.400 --> 02:39:44.160]  they've tried to mow down and give away all my assets
[02:39:44.160 --> 02:39:47.760]  except the one asset that would have got me out of bankruptcy my car washes
[02:39:47.760 --> 02:39:51.440]  where the owners are in default i'm foreclosing on my car wash buyers
[02:39:51.440 --> 02:39:55.440]  they haven't they haven't went after them yet because that's what happens
[02:39:55.440 --> 02:39:59.120]  if they go after them i'm out of bankruptcy and guess what they don't get
[02:39:59.120 --> 02:40:02.800]  their fees so at the end of the day the whole system's
[02:40:02.800 --> 02:40:07.760]  corrupt i mean look when i go to war if i go to war at least i want to be out of
[02:40:07.760 --> 02:40:11.440]  fair battle battlefield at least give me a gun and you have a gun
[02:40:11.440 --> 02:40:14.640]  or a knife and against the gun i had a slice water
[02:40:14.640 --> 02:40:19.680]  if they had a shotgun and then that's the bottom line and here's what happens
[02:40:19.680 --> 02:40:23.040]  you walk to them doors it's almost like they hand out the
[02:40:23.040 --> 02:40:28.400]  sleeping pills or diet pills we're going to execute you pills whatever
[02:40:28.400 --> 02:40:32.240]  and like i told my attorney about five of them i went through
[02:40:32.240 --> 02:40:36.080]  i said i'm not laying down and dying i'm fighting
[02:40:36.080 --> 02:40:39.600]  okay because i'm right and they're not going to take away everything that i
[02:40:39.600 --> 02:40:43.200]  worked my whole life for because they think they can they think i'm just
[02:40:43.200 --> 02:40:47.920]  going to be like the rest of them and die so so be careful be careful because
[02:40:47.920 --> 02:40:52.160]  if you're not i'll keep fighting i'll find a way to win and that's what i did
[02:40:52.160 --> 02:40:56.400]  and i can help the american people went to i can keep families together i can
[02:40:56.400 --> 02:41:00.160]  keep kids being being that's what your website covers
[02:41:00.160 --> 02:41:04.080]  is how you have been successful and what you learned
[02:41:04.080 --> 02:41:07.440]  through trial and error what you discovered let's go over
[02:41:07.440 --> 02:41:12.240]  the top five six ten whatever different scams that big banks run that you've
[02:41:12.240 --> 02:41:15.520]  discovered that you can hold their feet to the fire by pointing out they
[02:41:15.520 --> 02:41:19.120]  violated the law in court instead of just going in there
[02:41:19.120 --> 02:41:23.120]  and not knowing the judge and uh the trustee and others
[02:41:23.120 --> 02:41:26.560]  are all playing inside baseball you've been through the gauntlet
[02:41:26.560 --> 02:41:30.880]  so people can learn by your experience as a frontline guy who went through this
[02:41:30.880 --> 02:41:34.000]  fire came out even stronger on the other side
[02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:37.920]  give us some of the points that are covered at stopthegreedybanks.com
[02:41:37.920 --> 02:41:42.400]  well here's the points that are covered i i take a one two three basic step
[02:41:42.400 --> 02:41:46.560]  approach i want everybody to know their life is not
[02:41:46.560 --> 02:41:50.960]  over when they get put in a position where they can't make a payment
[02:41:50.960 --> 02:41:55.600]  the bottom line is the these banks have a fiduciary duty
[02:41:55.600 --> 02:42:01.200]  to qualify you under tila it's a federal law there's no arguing that you can't
[02:42:01.200 --> 02:42:05.040]  they can't they can't argue it they either did it right or they did it wrong
[02:42:05.040 --> 02:42:08.400]  there's about a thousand different things that have to happen and if they didn't
[02:42:08.400 --> 02:42:11.600]  do that then guess what you have rights you have legal
[02:42:11.600 --> 02:42:16.400]  remedies where you can go in under tila under respite and you can recover
[02:42:16.400 --> 02:42:20.400]  money okay and you can assert these offensive claims okay
[02:42:20.400 --> 02:42:24.320]  the bottom line is nobody has known how to do this
[02:42:24.320 --> 02:42:28.880]  we have families out there right now decimated the american country
[02:42:28.880 --> 02:42:31.760]  this is this country was built on the american family
[02:42:31.760 --> 02:42:36.560]  is now being dismantled piece by piece it cost me a 23 year marriage
[02:42:36.560 --> 02:42:43.040]  i was married 23 years okay because of tp morgan because of the people i'm not
[02:42:43.040 --> 02:42:46.000]  married now okay i have a great a great wife
[02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:49.680]  and she's a great mother and your sons in the major leagues
[02:42:49.680 --> 02:42:52.720]  and my sons he's not in the major leagues yet but he's he's playing for
[02:42:52.720 --> 02:42:56.560]  milwaukee he was a second round draft pick and you know i saw a blurb that he
[02:42:56.560 --> 02:43:00.320]  was about to go into i guess i was wrong yeah well he will be because he's a
[02:43:00.320 --> 02:43:03.040]  win he's a winning player and at the end of the day
[02:43:03.040 --> 02:43:07.520]  how it's in my book you're either a winning player or a losing player
[02:43:07.520 --> 02:43:09.600]  because the ones in the middle you can throw out
[02:43:09.600 --> 02:43:13.520]  okay i don't i don't play that but here's what i can do
[02:43:13.520 --> 02:43:17.120]  for all these people they're walking around waiting
[02:43:17.120 --> 02:43:20.880]  for the electric chair because that's what's happening there's nowhere to go
[02:43:20.880 --> 02:43:24.080]  there's nowhere to turn they do not know what to do
[02:43:24.080 --> 02:43:27.120]  and they're afraid to ask they won't even answer their phones
[02:43:27.120 --> 02:43:30.880]  if they call if they call my number on my website
[02:43:30.880 --> 02:43:34.640]  we have the lawyers we have the experts that can help them
[02:43:34.640 --> 02:43:39.200]  and save their homes it's not too late it's not too late trust me when i say
[02:43:39.200 --> 02:43:42.560]  this i've looked at your cases i've looked at what you're doing
[02:43:42.560 --> 02:43:45.360]  and it's right on from all the other top lawyers i know
[02:43:45.360 --> 02:43:49.600]  who are winning i'm not getting lawyers on who haven't won
[02:43:49.600 --> 02:43:54.400]  i've had a whole bunch of lawyers on who are in the us today wall street journal
[02:43:54.400 --> 02:43:59.280]  winning beating these major banks and you're one of the trailblazers
[02:43:59.280 --> 02:44:04.080]  who's been able to do this and beating the sec stop the greedy banks
[02:44:04.080 --> 02:44:07.680]  dot com it will put your your website back up on screen so i can give folks
[02:44:07.680 --> 02:44:11.440]  the number eight hundred seven two eight forty nine eighty one eight hundred
[02:44:11.440 --> 02:44:14.960]  seven two eight forty nine eighty one if folks want to find out
[02:44:14.960 --> 02:44:18.080]  more but so much of what you did just informationally
[02:44:18.080 --> 02:44:21.680]  is there on the sites your documents what you went through
[02:44:21.680 --> 02:44:25.360]  what happened now now expanding on this two years ago even
[02:44:25.360 --> 02:44:28.720]  12 months ago you talk about mortgage fraud it didn't break till about six
[02:44:28.720 --> 02:44:32.720]  months ago that it was real it was happening it was premeditated
[02:44:32.720 --> 02:44:37.520]  that they go into families and write them loans that they want to fail
[02:44:37.520 --> 02:44:41.040]  what's their end game because if you've got millions was it two three million in
[02:44:41.040 --> 02:44:44.640]  foreclosure now millions that have been foreclosed on a lot of people in
[02:44:44.640 --> 02:44:47.520]  california are just staying in their houses other neighborhoods
[02:44:47.520 --> 02:44:51.040]  are now ghost towns it's happening in other areas of the country
[02:44:51.040 --> 02:44:55.040]  what's the end game here for the banks here's the end game
[02:44:55.040 --> 02:44:59.200]  and it's a great point the end game is my attorney by the way
[02:44:59.200 --> 02:45:02.080]  i need to talk about him his name is Moshe Mordner
[02:45:02.080 --> 02:45:05.520]  Mordner law and a number six four six
[02:45:05.520 --> 02:45:09.520]  eight two zero eight seven seven zero
[02:45:09.520 --> 02:45:13.280]  Mordner Moshe Mordner with Mordner law in New York
[02:45:13.280 --> 02:45:18.480]  is a brilliant attorney and he's the one that put me in position to understand
[02:45:18.480 --> 02:45:21.920]  that my life isn't over see because what happens is
[02:45:21.920 --> 02:45:25.360]  if i understand when you're going through foreclosure
[02:45:25.360 --> 02:45:28.800]  you don't know what to do there's no word of parent there's no one that wants to
[02:45:28.800 --> 02:45:31.280]  hear if there's no way to help but guess what
[02:45:31.280 --> 02:45:34.720]  there is a way now and here's the end game the banks
[02:45:34.720 --> 02:45:38.720]  at the end of the day they do not want to foreclose on each house if they had
[02:45:38.720 --> 02:45:42.080]  an easier software way so what we're going to do what we've
[02:45:42.080 --> 02:45:46.000]  done is there's more there's more than meets the eye
[02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:49.280]  when once we've defeated these banks in court like we're doing
[02:45:49.280 --> 02:45:53.040]  we're now going to go to the bank to say okay this loan is predatory
[02:45:53.040 --> 02:45:57.680]  okay this million dollar loan we're going to pay you 500 000 for it
[02:45:57.680 --> 02:46:00.480]  when we pay you 500 000 the banks are going to say
[02:46:00.480 --> 02:46:04.720]  great that's no problem guess why the money that they lose between the 500 and
[02:46:04.720 --> 02:46:08.560]  the million the majority of it they get reimbursed anyway by the government
[02:46:08.560 --> 02:46:13.600]  that's how that's how crazy it is so if they explain that quantify that they're
[02:46:13.600 --> 02:46:16.640]  already getting bailed out so they're making money coming and going
[02:46:16.640 --> 02:46:20.320]  yeah so so so at the end of the day the banks
[02:46:20.320 --> 02:46:24.960]  there won't be court cases what they'll be is buying these loans from the banks
[02:46:24.960 --> 02:46:29.520]  at severe discounted rates and then we will have an underwriting division
[02:46:29.520 --> 02:46:32.640]  underwriting arm that will qualify these homeowners
[02:46:32.640 --> 02:46:36.880]  the correct way and then and by the way we're not out to save the man of these
[02:46:36.880 --> 02:46:40.080]  though if somebody does not qualify for a loan
[02:46:40.080 --> 02:46:43.520]  then they can't have that home they can't they will not be able to stay in that
[02:46:43.520 --> 02:46:46.960]  home but the majority of them if it's a million dollar loan
[02:46:46.960 --> 02:46:52.400]  and we were able to cut it down to 500 000 99.9% of these people will be able to
[02:46:52.400 --> 02:46:55.520]  save them and that's the big secret the federal government isn't telling people
[02:46:55.520 --> 02:46:59.280]  that now in the last two years the banks are negotiating if you know
[02:46:59.280 --> 02:47:02.400]  if you know what you're doing but if you don't know what you're doing the people
[02:47:02.400 --> 02:47:04.960]  perish for lack of knowledge they will eat your lunch
[02:47:04.960 --> 02:47:08.560]  they'll eat your lunch your life's over look
[02:47:08.560 --> 02:47:14.240]  americans the the american people the american families biggest investment is their home
[02:47:14.240 --> 02:47:18.720]  okay when you take away and you literally and by the way
[02:47:18.720 --> 02:47:23.200]  it doesn't go away you're hoping that it goes away you wish that it away
[02:47:23.200 --> 02:47:26.880]  but guess what is it big it's closer and closer and closer
[02:47:26.880 --> 02:47:30.880]  they come and they lock you out of your home you have nowhere to go
[02:47:30.880 --> 02:47:35.360]  you end up with divorce you end up with kids in a group but without a mother or
[02:47:35.360 --> 02:47:40.080]  father and it's it's a trickle down a family what i love about you is for a
[02:47:40.080 --> 02:47:43.840]  while you were pretty much homeless you didn't go crying your milk
[02:47:43.840 --> 02:47:48.880]  you got fired up got the facts and went out with nothing and beat these people
[02:47:48.880 --> 02:47:53.600]  well you're right and it's not something that that i'm that i'm proud of
[02:47:53.600 --> 02:47:57.840]  but what i did is i did what i have to do okay one of the things i wasn't going
[02:47:57.840 --> 02:48:01.520]  to do is i wasn't going to just get on my knees put my hands
[02:48:01.520 --> 02:48:05.680]  on my head my head and let them you know execute me because that's what they do
[02:48:05.680 --> 02:48:09.200]  in them core rooms and so when somebody that's what you were known for
[02:48:09.200 --> 02:48:12.560]  in in in the major baseball you didn't start fights
[02:48:12.560 --> 02:48:16.480]  but every time they slugged you or some guy attacked you you beat the tar out of
[02:48:16.480 --> 02:48:19.600]  him well that's right you know why is i used to
[02:48:19.600 --> 02:48:22.800]  tell my teammates why are you talking to the other team
[02:48:22.800 --> 02:48:26.640]  they're they're trying to take our money well that's the problem i have with
[02:48:26.640 --> 02:48:30.960]  sports now everyone's everyone's friend look we're playing for real money
[02:48:30.960 --> 02:48:33.600]  that's the business we're in we play to win
[02:48:33.600 --> 02:48:37.120]  okay now if you think playing in the major leagues was hard
[02:48:37.120 --> 02:48:40.480]  okay and by the way just remember some quick example
[02:48:40.480 --> 02:48:43.920]  if you want to play short stuff for the Yankees you have to take
[02:48:43.920 --> 02:48:49.440]  Eric Jeter's job okay so so it's very very difficult the odds of making it to
[02:48:49.440 --> 02:48:55.440]  the major leagues are astronomical but that was a walk in the park compared
[02:48:55.440 --> 02:48:58.720]  to what i've been through the last two years alex i don't want pity i don't
[02:48:58.720 --> 02:49:01.680]  want anybody to feel sorry for me because you know what
[02:49:01.680 --> 02:49:04.880]  our country's about what have you done for me lately
[02:49:04.880 --> 02:49:09.600]  okay so i'm about going forward not backwards i look at what the situation
[02:49:09.600 --> 02:49:13.520]  what happened what caused the situation i try to
[02:49:13.520 --> 02:49:18.000]  talk to my advisors i remedy it and i go forward and i fix it
[02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:21.360]  i don't live in the past because i don't do does nobody any good
[02:49:21.360 --> 02:49:26.400]  i can't change what happened i can change going forward that's the bottom line
[02:49:26.400 --> 02:49:30.560]  well incredible information in your case beating jp morgan and your victories
[02:49:30.560 --> 02:49:34.320]  against the sec it's all it stopped the greeting banks dot com and folks can see
[02:49:34.320 --> 02:49:38.000]  your investment uh record at nailsinvestment.com

[02:49:54.560 --> 02:49:58.160]  with me through the thick and thin because guess what
[02:49:58.160 --> 02:50:01.920]  remember i didn't get super overnight no
[02:50:01.920 --> 02:50:05.440]  no that's not what happened i got put in a situation
[02:50:05.440 --> 02:50:10.320]  by a bank that they're they're criminals okay well any it's the oldest story in
[02:50:10.320 --> 02:50:13.920]  the book they they come have you signed a contract 20
[02:50:13.920 --> 02:50:18.000]  years before for the farm you don't read the little clause about how they can
[02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:22.320]  demand all the note whenever they want and a year before you've paid 19 years
[02:50:22.320 --> 02:50:26.480]  you're doing okay your farm's making money every farmer knows this story
[02:50:26.480 --> 02:50:30.160]  a year before they come back and say but now we want 12 payments

[02:54:26.560 --> 02:54:30.800]  bob Chapman break it down here the system is designed to shut down small
[02:54:30.800 --> 02:54:34.080]  operators it's designed to nitpick remember what happened when charlie
[02:54:34.080 --> 02:54:37.520]  sheen was going to do the new loose change and i knew about it a year before
[02:54:37.520 --> 02:54:39.520]  it came out in the news i couldn't talk about it
[02:54:39.520 --> 02:54:43.840]  mark cuban was called and threatened i was in phone calls with these guys
[02:54:43.840 --> 02:54:47.120]  and told by the sec on the phone since you're going to make this film we're
[02:54:47.120 --> 02:54:50.640]  going to put a magnifying glass down your throat he made a couple hundred
[02:54:50.640 --> 02:54:54.080]  thousand dollars in stock trades and they claimed it was a fraud when the
[02:54:54.080 --> 02:54:56.640]  guy's worth five billion dollars didn't even know what was going on
[02:54:56.640 --> 02:55:01.520]  he beat them they came back again and it's the same thing the sec is a
[02:55:01.520 --> 02:55:06.080]  criminal organization run by the mega banks the offshore criminals
[02:55:06.080 --> 02:55:09.200]  to destroy this country and destroy the individual
[02:55:09.200 --> 02:55:13.360]  and to shut down small businesses and lennie i could only commend you for
[02:55:13.360 --> 02:55:16.880]  your fighting spirit because i've read your cases i've looked at the
[02:55:16.880 --> 02:55:21.280]  information and stopped the greedy banks calm and i'm just glad
[02:55:21.280 --> 02:55:24.960]  that you along with many other americans are starting to beat these people and
[02:55:24.960 --> 02:55:28.720]  now they're having to admit the fraud i mean that's that's a big victory that's
[02:55:28.720 --> 02:55:31.680]  got to feel good because you know a year and a half ago when this was starting
[02:55:31.680 --> 02:55:35.360]  up for you people didn't know this information
[02:55:35.360 --> 02:55:39.600]  or i guess two years ago now uh you know it's time for the media to
[02:55:39.600 --> 02:55:43.120]  actually look at what happened to you
[02:55:43.120 --> 02:55:47.600]  and and and what what i'll tell you is this okay
[02:55:47.600 --> 02:55:54.400]  americans need to understand they have a legal and then there's a real remedy
[02:55:54.400 --> 02:55:58.080]  okay that they have to recoup or the lesson
[02:55:58.080 --> 02:56:02.240]  the the claims that these banks have are trying to do when they're trying to
[02:56:02.240 --> 02:56:05.280]  steal your homes and that's what they're doing they're they're stealing homes
[02:56:05.280 --> 02:56:09.200]  they're basically putting you in a loan we were you set up to fail
[02:56:09.200 --> 02:56:13.440]  they're pushing paper i mean look the bottom line is though the notes are owned
[02:56:13.440 --> 02:56:17.200]  by a bunch of pensions funds that are now suing gp morgan i don't want to get
[02:56:17.200 --> 02:56:20.480]  into that that's another story okay these notes
[02:56:20.480 --> 02:56:24.640]  that they were securitized backed by a bunch of different funds that they're
[02:56:24.640 --> 02:56:28.000]  not even it's not even a real money they're literally just pushing paper
[02:56:28.000 --> 02:56:31.840]  and transferring paper around and then at the end of the day
[02:56:31.840 --> 02:56:36.560]  what happens is that people suffer the american families are the ones that
[02:56:36.560 --> 02:56:40.080]  suffer i have a way where i can help these people
[02:56:40.080 --> 02:56:44.240]  and i can show them what i did i i lay it all out on my website
[02:56:44.240 --> 02:56:48.080]  i hang it all out there i show them i show them the court document
[02:56:48.080 --> 02:56:52.400]  i show them that they have real real legal remedies
[02:56:52.400 --> 02:56:56.640]  when they when when they are getting for clothes on that they have to understand
[02:56:56.640 --> 02:57:00.160]  that there is a code the united states code okay
[02:57:00.160 --> 02:57:03.840]  it's it's 1601 title 15 of the united states code
[02:57:03.840 --> 02:57:07.200]  teela and defense is based on recoupment fraud
[02:57:07.200 --> 02:57:11.280]  breach of fiduciary duty and negligent misrepresentation
[02:57:11.280 --> 02:57:16.000]  okay this is something that they have there are grounds for remedies their
[02:57:16.000 --> 02:57:19.360]  life is not over and that's the problem alex people
[02:57:19.360 --> 02:57:23.040]  think they can't beat these big banks because they're bohemians
[02:57:23.040 --> 02:57:30.000]  look at gp morgan has 650 billion dollars in the bank in cash
[02:57:30.000 --> 02:57:35.760]  okay in cash okay that being said nobody thinks that they think there's no
[02:57:35.760 --> 02:57:38.720]  way out and that's what i thought until i met my
[02:57:38.720 --> 02:57:41.760]  attorney most of morgan are out of new york under modern law
[02:57:41.760 --> 02:57:46.080]  and he gave me real hope he showed me a way out we came in a back door
[02:57:46.080 --> 02:57:50.960]  we came in through federal law which is undisputed you cannot argue with the
[02:57:50.960 --> 02:57:53.760]  lawyers i've been interviewing say go federal as well
[02:57:53.760 --> 02:57:57.760]  they say sue the big banks get into court they'll immediately settle
[02:57:57.760 --> 02:58:01.520]  because they know that they've broken so many laws it'll make your head spin
