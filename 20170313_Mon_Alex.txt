[00:00.000 --> 00:29.920]  From the Infowars.com News Center, D.P.
[00:29.920 --> 00:35.320]  Behind Enemy Lines in Occupied Texas. Broadcasting Worldwide.
[00:35.320 --> 00:43.320]  You're listening to the voice of human resistance against the Technotronic Technocracy Tank-Oper.
[00:43.320 --> 00:46.320]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:46.320 --> 01:02.920]  You want it, baby? You're about to get it.
[01:02.920 --> 01:09.520]  Will these dreams still follow me? Are they gone? What's currently?
[01:09.520 --> 01:15.720]  Can't you see it up in the sky? As it kicks you in the face and sets you down?
[01:15.720 --> 01:21.720]  You never had the answers. I know, you tell me, the facts will fly.
[01:21.720 --> 01:26.720]  I really couldn't be bothered with you. Give it all to my fist time once.
[01:26.720 --> 01:35.720]  Well, it's 3.13. March 13, 2017 on this Monday, kickoff of the new week.
[01:35.720 --> 01:38.720]  We are live. I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:38.720 --> 01:49.720]  I've got to tell you, it is bizarrely surreal to be attacked by so many corporate media outlets,
[01:49.720 --> 01:54.720]  but also so-called entertainment outlets that are the big propaganda outlets.
[01:54.720 --> 01:59.720]  To be attacked by so many, I can't even keep track of it every day.
[01:59.720 --> 02:04.720]  Of course, obviously Saturday, Saturday Night Live attacked yours truly in the president
[02:04.720 --> 02:09.720]  during their opening intro live from New York Saturday Night Live with Alec Baldwin.
[02:09.720 --> 02:14.720]  And there were other attacks on late night shows last week that we didn't even cover.
[02:14.720 --> 02:21.720]  And then I was just shown, before I went live about 30 minutes ago, the latest episode of Homeland,
[02:21.720 --> 02:25.720]  that's a popular show on Showtime, because mainstream media has tiny audiences,
[02:25.720 --> 02:31.720]  but these shows and TV shows still have large audiences, especially things like Saturday Night Live.
[02:31.720 --> 02:36.720]  And it really hit me this morning. This is like a form of identity theft.
[02:36.720 --> 02:46.720]  This is beyond fake news, because they do things on these entertainment shows where they say,
[02:46.720 --> 02:51.720]  I heard black people aren't human. I heard it from Alex Jones at M4Words.
[02:51.720 --> 02:55.720]  That's what Alec Baldwin says as the president.
[02:55.720 --> 02:58.720]  He's saying, well, I heard from Alex Jones that those aren't people.
[02:58.720 --> 03:03.720]  He points out two black people. So obviously, Shane, we're racist.
[03:03.720 --> 03:11.720]  And then the lies just go on from there. And then the Homeland clip, this is every week now.
[03:11.720 --> 03:16.720]  They admit the characters based on me and tries to copy my voice, everything else.
[03:16.720 --> 03:23.720]  This actor, Jake Weber. And then, you know, the female president's son is a war hero
[03:23.720 --> 03:27.720]  and he's rushing in to save people, but they cut the video to say he's a coward.
[03:27.720 --> 03:31.720]  And then I'm fake news. And then I actually see people in the real world saying,
[03:31.720 --> 03:35.720]  oh, isn't Alex despicable the things he's done to the president?
[03:35.720 --> 03:39.720]  That's how mentally ill TV heads are that don't even know politics.
[03:39.720 --> 03:44.720]  They just get their news from these TV shows. It becomes a reality.
[03:44.720 --> 03:47.720]  People go, oh, well, they're just joking around on Saturday Night Live.
[03:47.720 --> 03:51.720]  Oh, really, every week putting words in the president's mouth that he didn't say.
[03:51.720 --> 03:57.720]  Then Snoop Dogg puts out a new rap video where he takes a gun and points it at the Trump clown
[03:57.720 --> 04:02.720]  and then talks about taking the clown out. No, this is picked up by idiots.
[04:02.720 --> 04:06.720]  By people with low IQs all over the place.
[04:06.720 --> 04:10.720]  Every race, color, and creed who believe it, folks, because you say enough,
[04:10.720 --> 04:14.720]  Trump done like black people, folks start to believe it.
[04:14.720 --> 04:17.720]  And where'd he learn it? I got it from Alex Jones.
[04:17.720 --> 04:22.720]  Yes, that's where it got it from. This is just stupid.
[04:22.720 --> 04:25.720]  And I think Alex Baldwin has been a great actor before.
[04:25.720 --> 04:29.720]  He didn't do a very good job on SNL, though. And then this Jake Weber is a horrible accent.
[04:29.720 --> 04:33.720]  He goes back and forth between Australian and then this Texas accent.
[04:33.720 --> 04:36.720]  I mean, they're going to try to steal my identity, man, at least do a good job.
[04:36.720 --> 04:43.720]  And then this is next level fraud, though, because this is fake news.
[04:43.720 --> 04:47.720]  Just like Colbert is a fake newscaster who does a fake news show,
[04:47.720 --> 04:52.720]  but then exposes me as fake news. It's fraud on fraud on fraud.
[04:52.720 --> 04:55.720]  The good news is their desperate system's going down
[04:55.720 --> 05:00.720]  and the thinking people know they're a pack of traitorous scum.
[05:00.720 --> 05:04.720]  Well, folks, America is now offensive in America.
[05:04.720 --> 05:06.720]  At a high school basketball game in Des Moines, Iowa,
[05:06.720 --> 05:11.720]  the students from Valley High decided to have a USA themed crowd and wore red, white, and blue.
[05:11.720 --> 05:14.720]  Despite winning the game, they lost in social justice
[05:14.720 --> 05:18.720]  as coaches and fans of the other team were offended by the patriotic attire.
[05:18.720 --> 05:23.720]  See, Des Moines North is said to have 66% minority enrollment compared to the 26% at Valley.
[05:23.720 --> 05:27.720]  As if saying one school as a majority minority isn't crazy enough,
[05:27.720 --> 05:32.720]  now they're saying it's offensive to wear red, white, and blue if you play against this school.
[05:32.720 --> 05:35.720]  The biggest issue was that there was a refugee on the North roster,
[05:35.720 --> 05:38.720]  but you'd think he would embrace the country that embraced him.
[05:38.720 --> 05:43.720]  This is a trend as last year, Ramapo College vetoed an American themed barbecue
[05:43.720 --> 05:46.720]  hosted by college Republicans and college Democrats.
[05:46.720 --> 05:50.720]  So we can't even come together in patriotism under these liberals.
[05:50.720 --> 05:52.720]  What is wrong with these people?
[05:52.720 --> 05:54.720]  Next, they're going to want to remove the flag.
[05:54.720 --> 05:56.720]  This is Owen Schreuer for Infowars.com.
[05:56.720 --> 06:09.720]  I'm proud to be an American.
[06:26.720 --> 06:31.720]  Plus, you can take it with you to jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[06:31.720 --> 06:34.720]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity,
[06:34.720 --> 06:38.720]  allowing you to create your own private power grid, literally anywhere in the world.
[06:38.720 --> 06:43.720]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, any time you need to get off the grid for a while.
[06:43.720 --> 06:46.720]  Go to privatepowergrid.com to watch this thing in action.
[06:46.720 --> 06:48.720]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[06:48.720 --> 06:54.720]  Even better, use coupon code PRIVATE at checkout and get a second PPX Energy Unit for free.
[06:54.720 --> 06:56.720]  Check it out at privatepowergrid.com.
[06:56.720 --> 07:25.720]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[07:27.720 --> 07:31.720]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products,
[07:31.720 --> 07:36.720]  we use decades-old scientific research that puts together the Rolls Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[07:36.720 --> 07:43.720]  Look, there's a reason deep cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary SpyJurex herbal processing technique.
[07:43.720 --> 07:47.720]  We use only the highest-quality organic herbs backed by serious research,
[07:47.720 --> 07:50.720]  and we still bring it to you at the best price out there.
[07:50.720 --> 07:55.720]  If you wish to find deep cleanse and experience the all-in-one cleansing, visit infowarslife.com.
[07:55.720 --> 07:59.720]  Or call 888-253-3139.
[08:26.720 --> 08:35.720]  Here we are on other Monday, 3-3-team, 2017.
[08:35.720 --> 08:37.720]  Thank you for joining us.
[08:37.720 --> 08:40.720]  You'll take my life, but I'll take yours too.
[08:40.720 --> 08:43.720]  You'll find your musket but I'll run you through.
[08:43.720 --> 08:47.720]  So when you're waiting for the next attack, you better stand.
[08:47.720 --> 08:49.720]  You better stand, there's no turning back.
[08:49.720 --> 08:52.720]  Mugle sounds, the charge begins.
[08:52.720 --> 08:56.720]  But on this battlefield, no one wins.
[08:56.720 --> 09:00.720]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen, if you're inside the globalist paradigm, you're a loser.
[09:00.720 --> 09:07.720]  If you're outside the paradigm, you are seeking to be a winner in the entire consciousness of humanity
[09:07.720 --> 09:11.720]  and the renaissance that we are in the middle of as we speak.
[09:11.720 --> 09:18.720]  Those that still serve the decadent, decaying, globalist, technocrat superclass are the losers.
[09:18.720 --> 09:25.720]  Those of us seeking liberty and freedom and have goodwill towards all, we are the future.
[09:25.720 --> 09:28.720]  Make no mistake.
[09:28.720 --> 09:37.720]  Okay, huge military news, massive economic news, really positive Trump news.
[09:37.720 --> 09:39.720]  It's amazing.
[09:39.720 --> 09:46.720]  But every time I think MSM and dying dinosaur media can't go any lower, they go lower.
[09:46.720 --> 09:54.720]  We didn't just dig out the firing letter of 93 U.S. attorneys in 1993.
[09:54.720 --> 09:56.720]  No pun intended.
[09:56.720 --> 10:01.720]  We found the video, Daria found the video of Janet Reno firing them.
[10:01.720 --> 10:06.720]  Now, everybody remembers this who has any memory, but I guess a lot of the public has a goldfish memory.
[10:06.720 --> 10:12.720]  Member Gruber, who headed up the Obamacare scam, he said, thank God you're so stupid, don't have attention spans.
[10:12.720 --> 10:19.720]  Well, I think freedom and being intelligent, more and more is about having an attention span.
[10:19.720 --> 10:25.720]  And people have to be basically trained to not have attention spans, and that's what's happened with the modern culture.
[10:25.720 --> 10:33.720]  What's happened with television and commercials and all of it, the ruling class admittedly tried to shrink the attention span.
[10:33.720 --> 10:37.720]  And that's why people like Steve Jobs said, I never let my children get on the computer.
[10:37.720 --> 10:43.720]  I didn't have iPads when I first came out before he died, because he said it brain damages them.
[10:43.720 --> 10:46.720]  They're like, wow, Steve Jobs, that's crazy.
[10:46.720 --> 10:48.720]  But all the statistics show it.
[10:48.720 --> 10:52.720]  What was crazy is that he'd be so honest about it.
[10:52.720 --> 10:55.720]  But we live in a world of fakeness.
[10:55.720 --> 10:59.720]  We live in a world of fraud spewed out by the establishment.
[10:59.720 --> 11:03.720]  This skull on the table here of your TV viewer is not a fake skull.
[11:03.720 --> 11:08.720]  It's illegal to have one of these unless you have a medical degree, and this is from my dad's from medical school.
[11:08.720 --> 11:11.720]  Back before they brought in all the plastic fake ones.
[11:11.720 --> 11:13.720]  But this is out of his office here.
[11:13.720 --> 11:14.720]  So I thought I'd bring it in today.
[11:14.720 --> 11:16.720]  I've got it here for several reasons.
[11:16.720 --> 11:24.720]  We'll talk about this remnant of a once alive human that walked bipedally upon the Earth,
[11:24.720 --> 11:31.720]  just to illustrate the whole life and death scenario and the reality that we face here on terra firma.
[11:31.720 --> 11:33.720]  Now continuing.
[11:33.720 --> 11:38.720]  We're going to be getting into that just because it illustrates the incredible lies that I have the headlines here.
[11:38.720 --> 11:41.720]  Anger mounts over handling of U.S. attorney firings.
[11:41.720 --> 11:44.720]  And Chuck Schumer comes out and says, this has never before been done.
[11:44.720 --> 11:47.720]  These are incredibly honorable people that were battling corruption.
[11:47.720 --> 11:52.720]  And he removed them because of corruption probes they were involved in.
[11:52.720 --> 11:56.720]  This rock star U.S. attorney was just dismissed for no reason.
[11:56.720 --> 11:59.720]  I've never seen anything like it.
[11:59.720 --> 12:02.720]  And in the articles and in the transcripts, it's crazy.
[12:02.720 --> 12:06.720]  They go, well, it's quite normal for them to fire a bunch of people when they get in.
[12:06.720 --> 12:08.720]  But Trump never made the announcement.
[12:08.720 --> 12:11.720]  So they kept waiting for the announcement and asking for the announcement.
[12:11.720 --> 12:14.720]  And then the announcement came and it was shocking.
[12:14.720 --> 12:18.720]  It's like teaching mental illness or something because it's so illogical.
[12:18.720 --> 12:19.720]  Sure, everybody does this.
[12:19.720 --> 12:21.720]  In fact, much larger numbers than Trump did is completely normal.
[12:21.720 --> 12:23.720]  But it was really me that he didn't tell anybody.
[12:23.720 --> 12:26.720]  But then he just made an announcement because they were waiting for the announcement.
[12:26.720 --> 12:29.720]  And you're reading it going.
[12:29.720 --> 12:34.720]  It feels like when you have the flu real bad and you've got like 104 temperature and things don't make sense.
[12:34.720 --> 12:40.720]  When you're reading the articles, they write, it's like you're reading something an insane person wrote.
[12:40.720 --> 12:44.720]  And they have all these deceptions and just in each article, which are just transcripts of the shows.
[12:44.720 --> 12:47.720]  It's just the loaded teleprompter BS they put out.
[12:47.720 --> 12:50.720]  And they put that out as an article as a derivative.
[12:50.720 --> 12:55.720]  They said, yes, other presidents have fired dozens like Bill Clinton.
[12:55.720 --> 12:57.720]  He fired dozens. He fired 93.
[12:57.720 --> 13:02.720]  But you don't want to say 93 versus 46 because that doesn't sound like it's a big deal.
[13:02.720 --> 13:04.720]  What sessions did? No, no.
[13:04.720 --> 13:15.720]  So you just say all dozens, dozens, dozens, several dozen, more than several dozen, quite a few dozen, seven dozen.
[13:15.720 --> 13:21.720]  And just you're like, how do they get so many people to sit there and write stuff like this?
[13:21.720 --> 13:23.720]  It's just all a tissue of fraud and lies.
[13:23.720 --> 13:27.720]  So that's coming up. I want to go back over that because it's so informative and we have the clip.
[13:27.720 --> 13:32.720]  Let's get the Janet Reno clip. It's a short one queued up here because we're the opposite of fake news.
[13:32.720 --> 13:37.720]  We actually go and show you, no, it's not dozens. It's 93.
[13:37.720 --> 13:40.720]  And most presidents do similar things.
[13:40.720 --> 13:42.720]  Bill Clinton fired the most at once.
[13:42.720 --> 13:50.720]  And Trump was nice and gave them a chance to actually execute the Constitution and follow his directives.
[13:50.720 --> 13:59.720]  And 50 days into it, the decision was made to fire their butts because they were in open mutiny against the president and the Constitution.
[13:59.720 --> 14:01.720]  That's what happened. And that's why they're gone.
[14:01.720 --> 14:05.720]  The president is giving these bureaucrats a chance to do their job and they're not doing it.
[14:05.720 --> 14:07.720]  So there's going to be big purges now.
[14:07.720 --> 14:10.720]  A lot of you reside at the State Department. Others are in open rebellion.
[14:10.720 --> 14:12.720]  Justice Department, State Department.
[14:12.720 --> 14:16.720]  Hey, you want to go out and work in the private sector for once in your life?
[14:16.720 --> 14:18.720]  Get ready because it's about to happen.
[14:18.720 --> 14:22.720]  And they'll have CNN and Chuck E. Schumer all breathless.
[14:22.720 --> 14:28.720]  I just told Chuck E. Schumer, the new leader of the Democrats, because at least he can talk unlike Pelosi.
[14:28.720 --> 14:38.720]  Who thinks George W. Bush is still in office and Maxine Waters thinks that Putin invaded Korea, not North or South Korea, but Korea.
[14:38.720 --> 14:47.720]  She doesn't know that North Korea is threatening to nuke South Korea and Japan and that nuclear bombers have been dispatched there and that there's U.S. warships right off the coast.
[14:47.720 --> 14:55.720]  That's the worst crisis since the Armistice or since the ceasefire at the end of the Korean War, technically it ever ended.
[14:55.720 --> 15:03.720]  Japan for the first time is deploying its biggest warships into the disputed South China Sea that China is now claiming 95% of.
[15:03.720 --> 15:06.720]  Oh, they're claiming right up into the territorial waters of a whole bunch of countries.
[15:06.720 --> 15:17.720]  Japan, the Philippines, thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of square miles, a major power grab by the little sweet commies.
[15:17.720 --> 15:23.720]  But it doesn't matter, Maxine Waters thinks the Russians invaded Korea and it's their fault.
[15:23.720 --> 15:32.720]  That's like if I said Texas was in New York or London was in Pakistan or New Jersey was in Japan.
[15:32.720 --> 15:38.720]  It's just cuckoo land, total cuckoo land, have no idea what planet they're on.
[15:38.720 --> 15:41.720]  It's as if they're already dead.
[15:41.720 --> 15:44.720]  There are many walking around that are physically alive that aren't really conscious.
[15:44.720 --> 15:52.720]  You could argue they're just walking, propelled, stomach self-propelled gas packs.
[15:52.720 --> 15:55.720]  It's very, very sad.
[15:55.720 --> 16:00.720]  But let me just mention the other stuff that's coming up here because it's all extremely important.
[16:00.720 --> 16:12.720]  A fake news has hit a new all-time low with SNL posing again as if they're news just like Colbert poses as a, again, anchor who then puts out fake news and calls real news fake news.
[16:12.720 --> 16:18.720]  And we have the new episode of Homeland with Jack Weber playing Alex Jones.
[16:18.720 --> 16:26.720]  We've got those headlines and he's putting out fake news and he's got to be shut down.
[16:26.720 --> 16:33.720]  Funny, right at the same time Facebook admits they're blocking most of our articles from being shared and now deleting many of them.
[16:33.720 --> 16:36.720]  Paul Watson has an article on m4wars.com today.
[16:36.720 --> 16:37.720]  People say, well, why are you on Facebook?
[16:37.720 --> 16:38.720]  Well, it's like a third of the Internet.
[16:38.720 --> 16:40.720]  It's where the people are we want to reach.
[16:40.720 --> 16:42.720]  We follow their terms of service.
[16:42.720 --> 16:43.720]  There's not profanity.
[16:43.720 --> 16:44.720]  There's not porn.
[16:44.720 --> 16:45.720]  They let jihadis post on there.
[16:45.720 --> 16:55.720]  But when we post a link to a former CIA section chief saying, no, it's true, my colleagues who are currently in say they were ordered to target Trump during and after the election.
[16:55.720 --> 16:57.720]  With spying wiretaps, you name it.
[16:57.720 --> 16:59.720]  Snowden's now come out as well.
[16:59.720 --> 17:01.720]  And they didn't let us share that.
[17:01.720 --> 17:06.720]  They deleted it because it was so real.
[17:06.720 --> 17:14.720]  And during a BBC interview, BBC interview this weekend, a geopolitical expert had his toddlers run in or a baby in a larger toddler.
[17:14.720 --> 17:19.720]  So the wife came in, grabbed the kids, you know, the dad's doing a show.
[17:19.720 --> 17:26.720]  And they went, oh my gosh, the patriarchy of this, it's horrible that a woman's taking care of the kids.
[17:26.720 --> 17:27.720]  I'm not kidding.
[17:27.720 --> 17:28.720]  That was national news.
[17:28.720 --> 17:29.720]  That's been banned.
[17:29.720 --> 17:31.720]  So that's been blocking them.
[17:31.720 --> 17:36.720]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, we're being banned and blocked because people listen to us.
[17:36.720 --> 17:37.720]  They know we're telling the truth.
[17:37.720 --> 17:43.720]  They believe us and they understand we're cutting edge and we have gigantic audiences and dominate every platform we're on.
[17:43.720 --> 17:49.720]  Paul Watson's being blocked and banned because his average video gets 3 million views.
[17:49.720 --> 17:51.720]  That's bigger than the top singing and show every day.
[17:51.720 --> 17:52.720]  They don't know what to do.
[17:52.720 --> 17:53.720]  They're panicking.
[17:53.720 --> 17:54.720]  They admit it.
[17:54.720 --> 18:01.720]  So they have all these new made for TV movies and Saturday Night Live and all these shows with Alec Baldwin saying,
[18:01.720 --> 18:02.720]  I'm the president.
[18:02.720 --> 18:05.720]  I learned black people aren't human from Alec Jones.
[18:05.720 --> 18:06.720]  Alec Jones and four words.
[18:06.720 --> 18:07.720]  It's a talk show.
[18:07.720 --> 18:10.720]  So people watching, that's not comedy.
[18:10.720 --> 18:14.720]  It's not funny with a laugh track running in the background.
[18:14.720 --> 18:18.720]  That's an attempt to literally tell people who've never heard of M4 Wars,
[18:18.720 --> 18:20.720]  because they know they're about to hear because the show's growing so fast,
[18:20.720 --> 18:22.720]  that, oh, that's a racist show.
[18:22.720 --> 18:24.720]  And it's meant to threaten everybody else.
[18:24.720 --> 18:28.720]  You don't ever speak the truth or stand up or we'll call you names.
[18:28.720 --> 18:30.720]  Well, go ahead, you lying scum.
[18:30.720 --> 18:35.720]  But CNN, MSNBC have almost no audience now.
[18:35.720 --> 18:37.720]  Their average show, a couple hundred thousand.
[18:37.720 --> 18:38.720]  Their biggest show is a million.
[18:38.720 --> 18:40.720]  I mean, that is nothing, folks.
[18:40.720 --> 18:41.720]  That is nothing.
[18:41.720 --> 18:42.720]  That is a joke.
[18:42.720 --> 18:45.720]  So they have to retreat in their own admissions.
[18:45.720 --> 18:52.720]  It's in the WikiLeaks, how Hollywood and all the big TV networks were working in the fiction department to attack populism.
[18:52.720 --> 18:54.720]  Trump, you name it.
[18:54.720 --> 18:56.720]  So we're going to get into that effect.
[18:56.720 --> 19:00.720]  I'm going to get into that right now because it's so important.
[19:00.720 --> 19:05.720]  Now I'm going to get into it at the next break at the bottom of the hour.
[19:05.720 --> 19:12.720]  Because I'm too nice about this and I need to really formulate my thoughts a little bit more.
[19:12.720 --> 19:19.720]  Because I was already going to come in here and talk about all the fake news and all the defamation and the identity theft that's going on.
[19:19.720 --> 19:27.720]  Because the public that still watches SNL and the public that watches things like Homeland is so dumbed down.
[19:27.720 --> 19:33.720]  People that watch mainline TV on average have lower IQs, lower earning rates.
[19:33.720 --> 19:36.720]  I mean, there's metrics, it's known.
[19:36.720 --> 19:37.720]  You can look it up.
[19:37.720 --> 19:38.720]  It causes brain damage.
[19:38.720 --> 19:47.720]  The very medium itself causes them to be disassociated, to be alone, to be unhealthy, causes neuron breakdown.
[19:47.720 --> 19:55.720]  Mainline television where you suspend disbelief and watch fantasy is very, very bad for your brain.
[19:55.720 --> 19:59.720]  It's not bad for children and small dosages, but it's bad for adults.
[19:59.720 --> 20:03.720]  Studies are legion about screen time you name it.
[20:03.720 --> 20:09.720]  We can just search engine, screen time hurting children, screen time hurting adults, neurological disorders up as a screen time.
[20:09.720 --> 20:11.720]  Alzheimer's linked to TV watching.
[20:11.720 --> 20:13.720]  I mean, it's known.
[20:13.720 --> 20:21.720]  But what's crazy about this is that it's not even good actors, but it hit me.
[20:21.720 --> 20:23.720]  This is identity theft.
[20:23.720 --> 20:29.720]  They admit we're going to have a character that sounds like Alex Jones and says some of the things like if you want to fight, you're going to get one.
[20:29.720 --> 20:31.720]  We are the resistance.
[20:31.720 --> 20:32.720]  We're restoring the Republic.
[20:32.720 --> 20:35.720]  Then they'll sandwich that with, by the way, I don't like black people.
[20:35.720 --> 20:36.720]  They'll take that out of context.
[20:36.720 --> 20:37.720]  I didn't say that.
[20:37.720 --> 20:38.720]  I'm quoting the shows.
[20:38.720 --> 20:40.720]  I hate, I'm not saying this.
[20:40.720 --> 20:41.720]  They'll say it.
[20:41.720 --> 20:42.720]  I hate gay people.
[20:42.720 --> 20:43.720]  It doesn't matter.
[20:43.720 --> 20:44.720]  You saw Colbert two weeks ago.
[20:44.720 --> 20:46.720]  Take me saying that and putting it on.
[20:46.720 --> 20:50.720]  Again, they are, they think of you as nobodies.
[20:50.720 --> 20:53.720]  They are deceiving you so massively.
[20:53.720 --> 20:55.720]  It's such an insult to everybody watching it.
[20:55.720 --> 20:57.720]  It's criminal.
[20:57.720 --> 20:58.720]  In my view.
[20:58.720 --> 21:00.720]  But it's identity theft.
[21:00.720 --> 21:07.720]  And they admit on the homeland show in press releases that they're attacking the evil fake news person Alex Jones.
[21:07.720 --> 21:16.720]  You know, Chris Carter, you can pull up Variety and Hollywood reporter last year when they had the return of X files.
[21:16.720 --> 21:18.720]  Had top ratings for Fox.
[21:18.720 --> 21:21.720]  I won't let it come back now, though, because it was too thought-provoking.
[21:21.720 --> 21:25.720]  And he said, oh, we're not just basing the main character, the new character on Alex Jones.
[21:25.720 --> 21:31.720]  We're basing the content on his analysis of globalism, world government vaccines, you name it.
[21:31.720 --> 21:34.720]  And I think Alex Jones is a patriot and a libertarian, not a racist, like the media says.
[21:34.720 --> 21:36.720]  That's, that's Chris Carter quotes.
[21:36.720 --> 21:38.720]  I'm paraphrasing them almost word for word.
[21:38.720 --> 21:41.720]  The point is that Chris Carter put out a good show.
[21:41.720 --> 21:45.720]  It had huge ratings and it was overall positive.
[21:45.720 --> 21:48.720]  And the Alex Jones character was better looking than I am.
[21:48.720 --> 21:54.720]  But he, he admitted he was creating something out of what I report on and break down.
[21:54.720 --> 21:55.720]  Plus it's popular.
[21:55.720 --> 21:56.720]  People are away.
[21:56.720 --> 21:57.720]  Chris Carter is a patriot.
[21:57.720 --> 22:02.720]  Chris Carter, you know, knows what's going on.
[22:02.720 --> 22:08.720]  And I know for a fact has been told by people in the CIA that are aware of what's going on years ago that the show is dead on.
[22:08.720 --> 22:10.720]  I'm just going to stop right there.
[22:10.720 --> 22:13.720]  But not, not homeland.
[22:13.720 --> 22:21.720]  They get a bad British actor who doesn't know an Australian versus a Texas accent.
[22:21.720 --> 22:28.720]  And then he sits there and says the most horrible things in my name and edits video of the hero son of the female president.
[22:28.720 --> 22:35.720]  Because they have these scripts all written thinking Hillary being that's admitted their whole agenda books already written with Chelsea and all of it.
[22:35.720 --> 22:44.720]  How she was going to take the helm of the world government medical system. Incredible.
[22:44.720 --> 22:49.720]  And so, so they can restrict free speech, use us as a test case to ban info wars and to ban drudge.
[22:49.720 --> 22:51.720]  Those are the main targets.
[22:51.720 --> 23:01.720]  And once they've set up with these strawmen that we're bad and we're evil, then everybody can have the political cover at Facebook and Twitter and Google to start restricting us and banning us and governing us down.
[23:01.720 --> 23:13.720]  And then finally, take down info wars and finally take down prison planet with we know the lawsuits they're kicking up and wiring up and churning up and designing right out of the Democratic Party.
[23:13.720 --> 23:20.720]  Oh, yeah. And then once they can get us shut down, they think they can shut you down, folks. This is happening. This is an assault on you.
[23:20.720 --> 23:29.720]  And they've got six different major TV shows that I know of right now attacking patriots, libertarians, people that talk about real issues.
[23:29.720 --> 23:32.720]  And a lot of others admittedly attacking Trump by name.
[23:32.720 --> 23:40.720]  But to sit there and have Alan Baldwin say horrible things in the name of Trump playing the personage of Trump.
[23:40.720 --> 23:50.720]  To weak minded TV viewers, it has the effect of weak minded people like Snoop Dogg, but not a video where he basically says he wants to go after the president with a gun because he doesn't like black people.
[23:50.720 --> 24:02.720]  No, Snoop, you know, you're playing to a bunch of brainwashed dumb people that sit there and are into your music, little thugs, it faced white kids that, you know, are hiding out in their mommy's basement and think you're the image of a man.
[24:02.720 --> 24:10.720]  You, you sit there and advertise to arrested development losers. That's what you do. You prey on dumb people. Snoop Dogg's real smart.
[24:10.720 --> 24:14.720]  Snoop Dogg just rips off little kids that never had a daddy.
[24:14.720 --> 24:21.720]  That's what he does. And he sits there and again shows basically himself with 357 Magnum about to kill President Trump.
[24:21.720 --> 24:24.720]  They got an actor who looks just like Trump. This is the crap they engage in.
[24:24.720 --> 24:28.720]  And the media talks about how great it is and how cute it is and how fun it is.
[24:28.720 --> 24:36.720]  Real war kicks off Snoop. All you guys that act like men and act like you're tough better hot tail your butts out of the country because you know what's going to happen and you do.
[24:36.720 --> 24:39.720]  That's why you got your private jets fueled and ready.
[24:39.720 --> 24:44.720]  And folks know where those jets have got landing spots and where people are trying to hide out with all their loot.
[24:44.720 --> 24:51.720]  You and Zuckerberg and everybody else just know this. The Nazis had to hide in holes and you're going to too.
[24:51.720 --> 24:58.720]  If you kick off this civil war, you're trying to fund. That's why they've got this whole new Michael Brown crap with his edited video out to get riots going again.
[24:58.720 --> 25:04.720]  Because that's all they've got is trying to get a race war going because God forbid Trump build a bunch of factories in black neighborhoods.
[25:04.720 --> 25:13.720]  God forbid he cut taxes and gives $25 billion to black colleges when Trump have $25 billion. Obama gave $4 billion in eight years.
[25:13.720 --> 25:16.720]  God forbid people actually get prosperity and come together.
[25:16.720 --> 25:24.720]  So we got to make sure people owned by the man by the globalist like Snoop sits out there and pushes his poison on young people.
[25:24.720 --> 25:30.720]  So they all dress like gangsters and walk around so the cops are trained to pull you over or throw you in jail.
[25:30.720 --> 25:42.720]  See, Snoop's there to get your kids trained to get ready to go to jail. That's why MTV in the late 80s, early 90s got the order by Viacom and the social engineers at the Carnegie Endowment and the major CIA endowments.
[25:42.720 --> 25:52.720]  This is all public knowledge, by the way, to create gangster rap to induce the black population to adopt it to be prepared for prison and now they're moving on to all the other populations.
[25:52.720 --> 26:00.720]  And so take Rick Ross, the fake Rick Ross, the obese rapper who was a jail guard.
[26:00.720 --> 26:08.720]  Well, he understands his job now is to go steal the identity of a real drug dealer, the real Rick Ross, and to go out and then to prime everybody for prison as well.
[26:08.720 --> 26:13.720]  So he's been working on the inside of the prison. Now he's working to get you all lined up at the outside of the prison.
[26:13.720 --> 26:22.720]  And they knew this a long time ago that in any major city, there were crime managers who wanted slave labor for the prisons.
[26:22.720 --> 26:31.720]  And so they would have older thugs that would induce the younger thugs into the gang life, but cull certain numbers of them, the dumber ones, into prison.
[26:31.720 --> 26:40.720]  That's why if you watch Pinocchio, anybody ever seen Pinocchio? Now he goes into the town and then he hangs around with some corrupt bad kids.
[26:40.720 --> 26:48.720]  And then he gets led on to the actual scam artist, the weasel and the fox, and then they get them all drunk and have them party in and play in pool.
[26:48.720 --> 26:55.720]  And then because they engage in vandalism and crime, they turn into jackasses, into fools, and they get loaded on the slave ship.
[26:55.720 --> 27:04.720]  That's an allegory. And see, that's what Snoop's doing is he's loading you on the slave ship.
[27:04.720 --> 27:14.720]  You slave master and you're his food. He works for a bigger slave master above him.
[27:14.720 --> 27:21.720]  So they know exactly what they're doing. He is a Judas goat to lead all the little boys into prison.
[27:21.720 --> 27:27.720]  All the little white boys, all the little black boys, all the little Hispanic boys, all the little boys into prison.
[27:27.720 --> 27:34.720]  While Snoop Dogg sits back there on the outside laughs how he pimped everybody.
[27:34.720 --> 27:44.720]  Well, guess what? We're going to expose you, Mr. Pimp, and your pimp handlers and your pimp game.
[27:44.720 --> 27:52.720]  We're going to talk about Jack Weber. We're going to play the clip when we come back and get into real fake news because this is the assault on your free press.
[27:52.720 --> 27:59.720]  This is the assault on the Liberty Movement and what we're trying to do and the trillions that have been announced in new development over the next three years.
[27:59.720 --> 28:09.720]  The 400 billion now that's already been put in by companies in growing, the three plus trillion in the stock market the last 50 days, 52 days.
[28:09.720 --> 28:19.720]  And it goes on and on and on as America is open for business and the world responds and believes that globalism is collapsing and globalism is in crisis everywhere.
[28:19.720 --> 28:27.720]  And Trump's got his head down doing everything he can to restore the Republic and everything he can to get big banks to make low interest loans to small businesses
[28:27.720 --> 28:38.720]  and everything he can to flood minority programs in colleges and in work programs to actually get people trained as machinists and as dental assistants
[28:38.720 --> 28:45.720]  and to go to school to be doctors and to go to school. I mean, just flooding real investment for the first time in decades.
[28:45.720 --> 28:54.720]  Point blank range, point blank range, trying to get you on your feet. A Snoop dog's running around. We got to kill this Trump.
[28:54.720 --> 29:06.720]  Yeah, as the big mega corporation put that out and the big newspapers go, how beautiful, how nice all the weird little fake white trendy managers who again are pimping everybody else as well.
[29:06.720 --> 29:11.720]  Oh look, the cool Snoop. He'll lead more kids into prison. Oh look, the Snoop.
[29:11.720 --> 29:16.720]  And then while Snoop's training you how to go out and get killed on the street with guns, wave them around at cops.
[29:16.720 --> 29:27.720]  Oh in the video, they're pointing guns at cops, everything. He'll sit around and say the cops are out to kill you when you're being inducted and trained by Soros and all these groups to go out and kill cops so cops get scared.
[29:27.720 --> 29:33.720]  All been set up playing the cops, playing you, playing everybody. But I'm here to tell you how the games played.
[29:33.720 --> 29:42.720]  I'm here to show you where the aces are up the sleeve and to break the will of the enemy and have real prosperity if we want it. Real unity if we want it.
[29:42.720 --> 29:49.720]  We all bleed the same red blood. We all live in the same country, the same republic and we sinkers swim together.
[29:49.720 --> 29:57.720]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:57.720 --> 30:04.720]  Well folks, America is now offensive in America.
[30:04.720 --> 30:12.720]  At a high school basketball game in Des Moines, Iowa, the students from Valley High decided to have a USA themed crowd and war red, white and blue.
[30:12.720 --> 30:18.720]  Despite winning the game, they lost in social justice as coaches and fans of the other team were offended by the patriotic attire.
[30:18.720 --> 30:27.720]  See, Des Moines North is said to have 66% minority enrollment compared to the 26% at Valley. As if saying one school as a majority minority isn't crazy enough,
[30:27.720 --> 30:32.720]  now they're saying it's offensive to wear red, white and blue if you play against this school.
[30:32.720 --> 30:38.720]  The biggest issue was that there was a refugee on the North roster, but you'd think he would embrace the country that embraced him.
[30:38.720 --> 30:46.720]  This is a trend, as last year, Ramapo College vetoed an American themed barbecue hosted by college republicans and college democrats.
[30:46.720 --> 30:52.720]  So we can't even come together in patriotism under these liberals. What is wrong with these people?
[30:52.720 --> 31:18.720]  Next they're going to want to remove the flag. This is Owen Schreuer for Infowars.com, proud to be an American.

[32:30.720 --> 32:36.720]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal. You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking,
[32:36.720 --> 32:44.720]  but you used the bones for strength from the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[32:44.720 --> 32:47.720]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[32:47.720 --> 32:54.720]  A long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were and this is a big part of it.

[36:15.720 --> 36:37.720]  Hillary Clinton attacks us by name. 60 Minutes does. Fake news. Fake comedy. It's all weaponized. Saturday Night Live. Co-Bear. All the shows. All three of the weekly night time shows attack us routinely and they just put out incredible disinformation.
[36:37.720 --> 36:45.720]  If I say Hillary's responsible for killing kids in Syria, they'll cut it together and say that I said she did it in the bottom of a pizza place. That's Fox News.
[36:45.720 --> 36:53.720]  The entire establishment hates us for a reason because we're here exposing them when they say, this is incredible. No one's ever fired U.S. attorneys.
[36:53.720 --> 37:02.720]  And then we have Janet Reno saying she fired 93 when she first got in office in 93. And we just show you how they're liars.
[37:02.720 --> 37:13.720]  So the mainstream media has killed the old-fashioned press. It always had problems, but it's become totally corporate and a bunch of PR, lackeys and hacks and hatchet men.
[37:13.720 --> 37:24.720]  They have destroyed themselves. And now they want to destroy anybody else that's trying to research what's happening. They don't want anybody else to have free speech, folks, because they can't contend with a free press and a free people.
[37:24.720 --> 37:34.720]  It's actually happening. And I have a whole stack of news here on that subject, but we have an InfoWars store flash special 30% off Lifestraw for a limited time.

[38:24.720 --> 38:32.720]  I wish there were a 10 star rating says NAP Polly from New York, New York.
[38:32.720 --> 38:36.720]  I took a serving in the morning and I felt like I can punch through walls.
[38:36.720 --> 38:45.720]  Then I took another serving this afternoon. I usually work out about a half hour. I worked out an hour and still wasn't tired. This product will give you the energy and masculine man needs.

[38:54.720 --> 38:58.720]  He can't say me enough. Thank you for this.
[38:58.720 --> 39:03.720]  All right. Well, thank you so much for the five star review from New York, New York.
[39:03.720 --> 39:12.720]  It's amazing. Superfemale vitality is 50% off today. Again, if you're signed up at the newsletter in full wars.com forward slash newsletter.
[39:12.720 --> 39:22.720]  When we send out the daily email with news articles and videos at the bottom will be a promo code for 50% off. Superfemale vitality.
[39:22.720 --> 39:30.720]  All right, I'm done there. Just we need to fund ourselves and we fund ourselves by you buying the products. That's why they're shutting down talk radio shutting down other systems.
[39:30.720 --> 39:40.720]  I've told our affiliates and other media that's fighting for liberty. The answer is go to direct sales where your radio station gets high quality products that you demonstrate that you talk about.
[39:40.720 --> 39:54.720]  And then if people believe in the type of information that's on the broadcast and want to get more of that information out that your station's putting out, they can be recruited to be team members to go out and hand out bumper stickers and have events to restore the republic.
[39:54.720 --> 40:02.720]  That's how we're going to do this. And then the local radio stations find great products and great sponsors, either locally produced or produced right here in America.
[40:02.720 --> 40:09.720]  And then that's how you can fund your operation. And also host events at local sponsors facilities. And we have a lot of stations that are doing this.
[40:09.720 --> 40:17.720]  I don't know why clear channel. I mean, look, I've been involved with that agencies that bought ads on clear channel networks.
[40:17.720 --> 40:26.720]  And when I wrote the ad, they got five to seven times the response. And when they use my voice, they got much higher response levels.
[40:26.720 --> 40:32.720]  And then higher up executives and I'm not involved with clear channel, but obviously they have a near radio monopoly like half the radio station, the country.
[40:32.720 --> 40:45.720]  So I'm involved with them some there's some patriots actually worked there. It comes down from higher up. No, we don't want to do this, you know, too much Alex Jones, he's promoting himself as if I need to have my voice on your network promoting a product.
[40:45.720 --> 40:55.720]  Shouldn't it be what gets results for your sponsors? The point is people respond to me. They respond to my voice. They respond to the ad copy. I write because it comes from a place of truth.
[40:55.720 --> 41:04.720]  And I know how to invigorate talk radio. I know how to energize it. I mean, I came from nowhere. Nobody else has done this independently.
[41:04.720 --> 41:16.720]  Like I've done it. No one has done what I've done in 19 years through the platform of GCN that's basically my satellite provider. Ted's done a lot of work behind the scenes remote show as well.
[41:16.720 --> 41:24.720]  But I mean, I don't just sit up here and shoot my mouth off. We've changed the world politically. Globalism is on fire being destroyed all over the planet.
[41:24.720 --> 41:32.720]  The tyrants are panicking and buying armored fortresses in remote areas of the planet and admitting it. That's all over the news.
[41:32.720 --> 41:39.720]  They've got a desperate rearguard action here of trying to start race wars in the West and, you know, hoping they can bring us down that way. But it's not happening.
[41:39.720 --> 41:47.720]  So when I say financially support us by the products, you buy more products, we hire more people, we get more aggressive, we get more in their face.
[41:47.720 --> 41:57.720]  We stand up against the attacks better and we win. You are the info war to support our local affiliates by their products, support their sponsors.
[41:57.720 --> 42:07.720]  This is a war. And they're trying to shut down talk radio. They're trying to shut down libertarians and conservatives and nationalists and just people that want free market prosperity.
[42:07.720 --> 42:20.720]  Good, straight shooting, hardworking people, no matter what color they are, are under attack by the establishment because they want to sow this country up in a depression and consolidate it and buy it all up and turn us all into renters
[42:20.720 --> 42:29.720]  and make the average, you know, family home a thousand square feet. The average person's apartment 220 square feet. They're training us to have less.
[42:29.720 --> 42:37.720]  Just like McDonald's famously put signs up saying thank you like you're supposed to throw away your own trash so they could get rid of employees.
[42:37.720 --> 42:45.720]  You should just want a place that has employees so that you have an entry level into the economy and demand quality in the economy, not the opposite.
[42:45.720 --> 42:55.720]  Globalism is about you being poor and society falling apart while the elite eat caviar. And we're not going to stand for that, folks.
[42:55.720 --> 43:04.720]  Excuse me, I'm ranting off into economics right now. It's just that the higher ups in these big corporations want talk radio to die.
[43:04.720 --> 43:19.720]  They know full well how to save it. Talk radio has, I don't want to exaggerate, 15 times the audience of all the major cable news combined.
[43:19.720 --> 43:34.720]  I mean, it's incredible. Big talk stations that have been in places like Austin like 590 a.m. sometimes even in the in the in the in the arbitration ratings, they'll have a quarter million people listening in an hour.
[43:34.720 --> 43:41.720]  That's one station or stations in New York that have a million people listening an hour and they can't even make money.
[43:41.720 --> 43:54.720]  But then a racial Maddow with a with a million lit viewers will get 20 times the sponsorship because the establishment wants to prop that garbage up its economic warfare.
[43:54.720 --> 44:03.720]  They don't care about the money they're making. They care about dominating the entire market and controlling the full spectrum.
[44:03.720 --> 44:12.720]  That's why you see the big globalist Archer Daniels meddling in Monsanto ads on CNN because they want the status quo in place.
[44:12.720 --> 44:27.720]  So it's an act of rebellion when you buy these products, but everybody needs our anti fungal product that's such a game changer 10% off when you get it with the biome defense today,
[44:27.720 --> 44:34.720]  which is the probiotic that flushes out the back bacteria. You have the good bacteria best probiotic out there. Get it with the my Co Z X together.
[44:34.720 --> 44:41.720]  It goes to go like a horse and carriage to see the good bacteria from the biome defense, the good cultures. They only displaced the bad bacteria.
[44:41.720 --> 44:49.720]  They can't displace the yeast and the mold. Some people have more of that. They have bacteria that my Co Z X naturally does it and it's strong.
[44:49.720 --> 44:58.720]  I wouldn't take it on empty stomach. It's the real deal in 4WarsLife.com and 4WarsStore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[44:58.720 --> 45:05.720]  And it's going to sell out today. I'm going to hold some back for auto ship, but we're going to take the 10% discount off at midnight tonight.
[45:05.720 --> 45:09.720]  So just heads up for that.
[45:09.720 --> 45:14.720]  All right, I'm done plugging. I just tend to forget to do it sometimes for two, three hours and don't even do it for a whole show.
[45:14.720 --> 45:24.720]  So when I do, I tend to have a little bit more hefty, hearty plug. Now, I'm just going to do this at the start of the next hour because here's the deal.
[45:24.720 --> 45:40.720]  I get so disgusted is the word, not even angry. When I see the filth at Saturday Night Live and the filth that's 10 times worse at showtime with this Jack Weber, another little nobody, talentless actor in my view,
[45:40.720 --> 45:51.720]  who has stolen my identity and who then admits that they say in the news, it's Alex Jones, and then he says horrible stuff I never said.
[45:51.720 --> 45:58.720]  And then he's got the nerve and they've got the nerve to run around. I mean, it's just like that guy. Who's the guy that did the Mr. Show and all the other stuff?
[45:58.720 --> 46:11.720]  Port Landia who did a whole movie two years ago about me and then people run around screaming the N word. David Cross, they just run around screaming N word, N word, N word.
[46:11.720 --> 46:17.720]  And then they say in the news, that's me. And then people walk up and say, are you the one happened like two weeks ago?
[46:17.720 --> 46:23.720]  Somebody asked me on the street, a white lady, do you love Kettler and you run around screaming the N word?
[46:23.720 --> 46:32.720]  And I said, no. And she said, well, I saw it on TV and I'm like, lady, that ain't me, man. A third of the public, they admit have lower brain waves from TV.
[46:32.720 --> 46:40.720]  They're in a near sleep state. They've been hypnotized and they're watching this stuff. And even though he doesn't even look like me very much, he sounds like me.
[46:40.720 --> 46:47.720]  And so, and David Cross does this stuff. I hate, you know, I'm going to even say it or they'll take it out. You know, I hate, you know what? I hate blah, blah, blah.
[46:47.720 --> 46:58.720]  I heard it from all shows. And it's like, wow, these people are the scum of the earth, the writers, the people that own Showtime.
[46:58.720 --> 47:08.720]  Who own Showtime? I forget. And yes, it is NBC. And they just, black people aren't human. That's, that's Alec Baldwin saying that.
[47:08.720 --> 47:22.720]  You watch these will take that out and say, no, I didn't. The Alec Baldwin character as the president. I thought the separate they are folks. The Alec Baldwin character playing a part of the president straw man says, you're not humans to black people.
[47:22.720 --> 47:33.720]  You're aliens. And CBS Corporation owns it. They're the worst. No wonder.
[47:33.720 --> 47:42.720]  It just makes my head spin. I want to get focused and kind of just go through it linearly and just play the clips and analyze them because
[47:42.720 --> 47:55.720]  it doesn't hurt me. They're hurting their viewers. They're assaulting them with just outrageous lies with huge sets and huge budgets with Alec Baldwin
[47:55.720 --> 48:03.720]  playing the part of the president saying that President Trump doesn't think black people are human and showing the black people all mad.
[48:03.720 --> 48:11.720]  And then the next day they kick off the new fake Ferguson edited video, try to get riots going in and shots have been fired. I mean, this is how dumb they think you are.
[48:11.720 --> 48:18.720]  It's so evil to watch them praying on people and to know that now I used to like Alec Baldwin as an actor. I think he's a pretty good actor.
[48:18.720 --> 48:29.720]  It's like I can't watch him in a movie. It's like he's too disturbing because I realize he's a horrible, evil person who wants to pray on people and lie to viewers.
[48:29.720 --> 48:35.720]  Oh, it's comedy. No, it's not. SNL admitted they wanted Hillary to get elected. They admitted.
[48:35.720 --> 48:41.720]  I know people that were there at the SNL headquarters on election night when they were crying and panicking when Hillary lost. It's a cult.
[48:41.720 --> 48:49.720]  But then on the homeland, it's not Islamic terrorists were battling anymore. It's Alex Jones.
[48:49.720 --> 49:01.720]  And they admit the news. It's Alex Jones. So again, I don't want to make this up about myself. I have to because they're putting out all this fake news that I'm fake with actors and these huge budgets and all this.
[49:01.720 --> 49:11.720]  And in hundreds of newspapers a day, so they can set the precedent to ban us. And now in live time, they're restricting us and first not letting us share.
[49:11.720 --> 49:19.720]  We used to get about 5,000 shares on average on our main Facebook. Now it's down to about 200. And people tell us they're not letting them link the articles, the videos.
[49:19.720 --> 49:29.720]  They're blocking them. They're taking them down. They put a new thing out where they have master moderators whose one vote is the power of 100 votes who then go in and say, oh, this is fake news.
[49:29.720 --> 49:37.720]  Paul Watson has an article. We can show folks the graphic of the screenshots. Scroll down please. And notice it only lets you say it's fake.
[49:37.720 --> 49:46.720]  Blow that up for me. It only lets you say it's fake. You can't go in there and vote on, oh, I think this is real. I think this is pertinent. I think this is valuable.
[49:46.720 --> 50:03.720]  No, it says it's annoying and not entertaining or it's spam. You see how they operate? You see how they work? It only gives you the opportunity to say it's annoying or not interesting.
[50:03.720 --> 50:07.720]  I think it shouldn't be on Facebook. It's a fake news story. It's spam.
[50:07.720 --> 50:18.720]  And then they say, oh, we had some moderators say your article with Senator Rand Paul was fake and they took it down.
[50:18.720 --> 50:27.720]  Oh, your video with a former CIA section chief saying his colleagues told him they were ordered to target Trump. That's spam.
[50:27.720 --> 50:37.720]  No, that's incredibly sensational and documented and important and a whistleblower. But see, it doesn't matter because they've got their little socialist, social justice warriors.
[50:37.720 --> 50:47.720]  YouTube announced a few months ago, they've got supermods now that are just communities that have shown that they're anti-free speech, anti-conservative, who get knighted as supermods.
[50:47.720 --> 50:53.720]  And then they go and say, we're blocking you. No one can see your video. Your subscribers can't see it. We said it's fake.
[50:53.720 --> 51:00.720]  Really? It's fake when I have to respond to Alec Baldwin attacking me by name? Am I allowed to respond?
[51:23.720 --> 51:32.720]  So we keep some food on hand just in case. My family and I have found a product that helps us do this better. It's a home freeze dryer from Harvest Right.

[53:59.720 --> 54:20.720]  You know, as a patriot, I don't even want to tell our listeners to go on Facebook and go find socialist, globalist garbage and then downboat it to remove it off sites.
[54:20.720 --> 54:30.720]  I just want our information to be able to compete with it head to head. But it doesn't matter. They have their supermods chosen from the algorithm because they hate libertarian or pro-human speech.
[54:30.720 --> 54:35.720]  And so your vote doesn't even count to begin with. It's all rigged. Facebook and YouTube admit that.
[54:35.720 --> 54:46.720]  Zuckerberg has bragged to the Communist Chinese that he has perfected censorship tools in the United States on the population and it's in the news that he's proving himself to them.
[54:46.720 --> 54:56.720]  It's in the news that Google is courting China and proving itself with censorship in America and Europe. This is public.
[54:56.720 --> 55:02.720]  But it's not even an outrage. It's, oh, Google and Facebook are courting China and showing them how they can ban nationalist news.
[55:02.720 --> 55:09.720]  And they see all these headlines. Democrats and globalists hope China can make Americans get back in the globalist system.
[55:09.720 --> 55:20.720]  And then the Chinese president, a dictator, goes to Davos a month ago and says, I'll whip America into shape. And the average liberal goes, good, yes, oh, good master.
[55:20.720 --> 55:29.720]  Liberals, a lot of you like Buddhism, right? They kill Buddhists for practicing in their dumb ass. God, you people are sick.
[55:29.720 --> 55:37.720]  They just made it a death penalty sentence to criticize any Communist leader today, by the way, in China. They already did that, but now it's public.
[55:37.720 --> 55:45.720]  You don't care. North Korea, China, they're not America, so you lionize them. They have liberal bars all over the U.S. with Mao Zedong crap.
[55:45.720 --> 55:51.720]  And I've actually been in them in Denver and people actually liked it with their smartphones and fancy cars outside.
[55:51.720 --> 55:57.720]  And I said, this is all capitalism gave us to you. They're like, we don't care. They like the sickness of it. They like the evilness of it.
[55:57.720 --> 56:01.720]  Like all the big feminist groups wearing shirts. I got an abortion. I like killing my baby.
[56:01.720 --> 56:07.720]  Remember that video we played, the woman going, I really loved it. It was good to kill my baby. It made me happy.
[56:07.720 --> 56:13.720]  Everybody's like, oh, pretty good. It's all just spoiled rotten nothings that have been given everything.
[56:13.720 --> 56:19.720]  So they're just basically pissing all over it, just begging for destruction. That happens in history, doesn't it?
[56:19.720 --> 56:26.720]  You read about the Bible happening to civilizations as well. So that's all coming up.
[56:26.720 --> 56:32.720]  Oh, Google is another step closer to being unblocked in China.
[56:32.720 --> 56:38.720]  Oh my gosh, it's that just dandy. They're working hard.
[56:38.720 --> 56:43.720]  They're working hard to prove they can censor here. We'll prove ourselves, Cummins, Chinese.
[56:43.720 --> 56:48.720]  Biopoly would as soon as you can and help block Alex Jones into the president.
[56:48.720 --> 56:56.720]  And they've got the new Michael Bay movie coming out where Trump is a dictator that the Chinese have to take out with US special forces.
[56:56.720 --> 57:05.720]  Wow. Trump's a dictator in the new Michael Bay movie coming out financed by the Communist Chinese.
[57:05.720 --> 57:12.720]  Foreign open psych warfare against our country. It's outrageous what criminal traders these people are.
[57:12.720 --> 57:20.720]  These TV shows and all these movies where I'm a racist and I'm bad and I'm fake news with actors playing Alex Jones saying stuff I never said.
[57:20.720 --> 57:31.720]  Total war against us because we are the Republic. We are 1776. We are the good guys and we're kicking their ass with almost nothing.
[57:31.720 --> 57:36.720]  But we've got everything as we've got you. Since I mentioned it, they'll say it's not true and fake news.
[57:36.720 --> 57:43.720]  They're actually has articles now saying it's fake news claiming other attorneys were fired. It's hoping you don't go look it up.
[57:43.720 --> 57:50.720]  CNN anger mounts over handling of US attorney firings. Why they weren't told they'd be fired. No one's ever told. They're fired.
[57:50.720 --> 58:00.720]  So let's go out with Janet Reno in 1993. Remember her? Lovely lady. Remember that monster, the butcher of Waco? Here she is.
[58:00.720 --> 58:06.720]  Janet Reno fired every holdover Republican US attorney all across the country.
[58:06.720 --> 58:10.720]  I have asked for their resignations as a request to the president.
[58:10.720 --> 58:15.720]  All 93 US attorneys a one day clean sweep.
[58:15.720 --> 58:21.720]  Presidents do replace the other party's appointees but usually not wholesale.
[58:21.720 --> 58:34.720]  It's important that we build a team that reflects our desire to have a justice department marked by excellence, marked by diversity, marked by professionalism and integrity.
[58:34.720 --> 58:50.720]  I want. All right, folks, we'll be back and stay with us. I'm Alex Jones, the anti fake news. You are listening to GCN. Visit GCN live.com today.
[58:50.720 --> 59:00.720]  We're selling a product DNA force that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce about a group you took years for you to develop DNA force for us.
[59:00.720 --> 59:06.720]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[59:06.720 --> 59:15.720]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres. Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[59:15.720 --> 59:17.720]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[59:17.720 --> 59:24.720]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials. It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[59:24.720 --> 59:29.720]  It works like an antioxidant. It works to repair nerve growth factor.

[1:00:00.720 --> 1:00:14.720]  Rallying Patriots Worldwide!
[1:00:14.720 --> 1:00:17.720]  Rallying Patriots Worldwide.
[1:00:17.720 --> 1:00:18.720]  You're not as globalist.
[1:00:18.720 --> 1:00:33.720]  It's the defense of human living. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. They're in deep mud up to their axels worldwide and the surge has only begun.
[1:00:33.720 --> 1:00:39.720]  That's why they're so desperate throwing everything they've got at humanity right now.
[1:00:39.720 --> 1:00:45.720]  And all it's going to do is accelerate their fall. That's not confidence. That's history.
[1:00:45.720 --> 1:00:52.720]  The arrogance of elites throughout history is unbound.
[1:00:52.720 --> 1:00:56.720]  It's basically unending. There is there is no bottom to it.
[1:00:56.720 --> 1:01:06.720]  But we've gone from being way behind and now having major beachheads globally against their operations and our territory is expanding inside the human mind.
[1:01:06.720 --> 1:01:16.720]  Their territory is shrinking. So I'm going to really discipline myself at the start of the next segment and give you a focused laser beam analysis of what I kind of ran it about some of the last hour.
[1:01:16.720 --> 1:01:20.720]  Then we're going to get into everything I haven't hit today.
[1:01:20.720 --> 1:01:25.720]  Dr. Corsi is a great guy. Three times New York Times number one bestselling author.
[1:01:25.720 --> 1:01:35.720]  Treasury report Obama stole from Fannie Freddie investors to fund Obamacare.
[1:01:35.720 --> 1:01:39.720]  Now you're like, wait a minute, we we heard this two weeks ago from Corsi and exclusive. Yes.
[1:01:39.720 --> 1:01:46.720]  Now he got treasury documents that confirm the other documents and he's gotten this from the White House just so you know.
[1:01:46.720 --> 1:01:53.720]  And notice it's so powerful. You haven't seen this anywhere. You know, he has copies of the documents, the court rulings, all of it.
[1:01:53.720 --> 1:01:56.720]  And this is what the White House wants you to know about now.
[1:01:56.720 --> 1:02:04.720]  So many times MSM will attack us and help put out something that they hope nobody sees and it becomes a national news story.
[1:02:04.720 --> 1:02:08.720]  More often than not, it's drudge will link to something that they've been blockading and it finally gets out.
[1:02:08.720 --> 1:02:10.720]  But this is a big deal.
[1:02:10.720 --> 1:02:15.720]  Close to $200 billion stolen out of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
[1:02:15.720 --> 1:02:20.720]  And even more documents confirming that they did that in just 2013 alone.
[1:02:20.720 --> 1:02:23.720]  The looting has been biblical.
[1:02:23.720 --> 1:02:25.720]  We've only gotten certain documents from certain years.
[1:02:25.720 --> 1:02:30.720]  They've been trying to block all this and now Trump's people have access to a lot of it.
[1:02:30.720 --> 1:02:39.720]  And they're aware of the lawsuits and in court cases. So they're desperately trying to get you, we, the people, us to get this information out.
[1:02:39.720 --> 1:02:44.720]  So that's coming up. Treasury report Obama stole from Fannie Freddie investors to fund Obamacare.
[1:02:44.720 --> 1:02:46.720]  And let's not get fatigued with the tyranny.
[1:02:46.720 --> 1:02:52.720]  And all we know they rob everybody. That's just what they do. We have to bring the criminals to justice.
[1:02:52.720 --> 1:02:58.720]  They're running around hyperventilating about Donald Trump all day in this garbage, you know, oh, met with the Russians and then he didn't.
[1:02:58.720 --> 1:03:04.720]  Meanwhile, as I told you, I went and looked at her list. Chuck Schumer, Pelosi, all of them, there's photos, there's videos of it.
[1:03:04.720 --> 1:03:08.720]  All met with the Russian ambassador way more than they met with any of the Republicans.
[1:03:08.720 --> 1:03:11.720]  But it's normal to do that at that level. That's what you do.
[1:03:11.720 --> 1:03:22.720]  And the Russians have come out and said, completely normal at that level of diplomatic interchange, intercourse to discuss and to talk.
[1:03:22.720 --> 1:03:26.720]  That's what you do. This is bizarre. This is hysteria. This is weird.
[1:03:26.720 --> 1:03:32.720]  And Senator Rand Paul has come out and said that too. This just goes on and on and on and it's totally made up.
[1:03:32.720 --> 1:03:40.720]  Oh, McCain says he wants to see by today. He said that on Friday. I want to see, Mr. President, the proof that you've got that you were being surveilled.
[1:03:40.720 --> 1:03:47.720]  The word surveilled, wiretaps and old archaic term. No, it was intercepted in the exchanges under federal law.
[1:03:47.720 --> 1:03:51.720]  They're grabbing all the foreign communication. So when the president is talking to foreign leaders, it's all being recorded.
[1:03:51.720 --> 1:03:57.720]  And when the president-elect was, it's all being recorded. And so they're playing games with words.
[1:03:57.720 --> 1:04:01.720]  They were surveilling the president. The New York Times admitted that months ago.
[1:04:01.720 --> 1:04:10.720]  We've shown the headline January 20th and more. Now the New York Times is, oh, we have to retract that. We were wrong.
[1:04:10.720 --> 1:04:15.720]  And of course, what did Roger Stone say at the time? That day at the inauguration, he said, it's totally made up.
[1:04:15.720 --> 1:04:19.720]  I've never talked to him. I said, I have phone calls. This is ridiculous. I've talked to no one.
[1:04:19.720 --> 1:04:27.720]  So then we learned with all their surveillance that they had him on a public message board with the public account of Guccifer 2.0 had been deleted.
[1:04:27.720 --> 1:04:33.720]  And of course, he's there. We're there running around trying to find new leaks. You bet. To expose Hillary.
[1:04:33.720 --> 1:04:37.720]  And they said, oh, that's talking to the Russians. They haven't proven Guccifer 2.0 is the Russians.
[1:04:37.720 --> 1:04:42.720]  But it's a comment on a public page about where glad your Twitter account got put back up.
[1:04:42.720 --> 1:04:48.720]  And they turned that into headlines. Roger Stone caught in secret communication. And then he releases them. They're public.
[1:04:48.720 --> 1:04:53.720]  He tweeted about his talking to Guccifer 2.0 back at the time. He's on the air talking about it.
[1:04:53.720 --> 1:05:00.720]  They're like, oh my gosh, we found the proof. And did you hear? He fired the US attorneys. No one's ever done that.
[1:05:00.720 --> 1:05:04.720]  Well, folks, America is now offensive in America.
[1:05:04.720 --> 1:05:11.720]  At a high school basketball game in Des Moines, Iowa, the students from Valley High decided to have a USA themed crowd and wore red, white and blue.
[1:05:11.720 --> 1:05:18.720]  Despite winning the game, they lost in social justice as coaches and fans of the other team were offended by the patriotic attire.
[1:05:18.720 --> 1:05:23.720]  See, Des Moines North is said to have 66% minority enrollment compared to the 26% at Valley.
[1:05:23.720 --> 1:05:31.720]  As if saying one school as a majority minority isn't crazy enough, now they're saying it's offensive to wear red, white and blue if you play against this school.
[1:05:31.720 --> 1:05:37.720]  The biggest issue was that there was a refugee on the North roster, but you'd think he would embrace the country that embraced him.
[1:05:37.720 --> 1:05:46.720]  This is a trend as last year, Ramaco College vetoed an American themed barbecue hosted by college Republicans and college Democrats.
[1:05:46.720 --> 1:05:51.720]  So we can't even come together in patriotism under these liberals. What is wrong with these people?
[1:05:51.720 --> 1:06:08.720]  Next, they're going to want to remove the flag. This is Owen Schreuer for infowars.com. Proud to be an American.
[1:06:22.720 --> 1:06:30.720]  Caveman. It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors and we need to do everything we can to recapture them.
[1:06:30.720 --> 1:06:38.720]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal. You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[1:06:38.720 --> 1:06:46.720]  From the outside structure full of minerals and Kiko factors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[1:06:46.720 --> 1:06:54.720]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were and this is a big part of it.
[1:06:54.720 --> 1:07:00.720]  I know you're going to want to check out caveman ultimate paleo formula for yourself in infowarslife.com today.
[1:07:00.720 --> 1:07:06.720]  The reason infowarslife has five star ratings on major third party sites is because I want products I'm going to use for my family.
[1:07:06.720 --> 1:07:13.720]  I take this. My family takes this and then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're going to find anywhere.
[1:07:13.720 --> 1:07:17.720]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at infowarslife.com.
[1:07:17.720 --> 1:07:27.720]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference. I don't feel good. The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life changing for me.
[1:07:27.720 --> 1:07:35.720]  Yeah, I've actually just run out of my superfemale. I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[1:07:35.720 --> 1:07:45.720]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good. And I know my hair is luxurious once again. So obviously the superfemale is amazing. I love it.
[1:07:45.720 --> 1:07:55.720]  Nascent iodine is essential. Survival Shield X2. If there's one product that I would say is life changing that I would suggest it's nascent iodine Survival Shield X2.
[1:07:55.720 --> 1:08:12.720]  It's a five star rating. It's a win-win at infowarslife.com.
[1:08:12.720 --> 1:08:20.720]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[1:08:20.720 --> 1:08:31.720]  We are now 53 days into the first four years of the 45th President of the United States, Donald John Trump.
[1:08:31.720 --> 1:08:45.720]  Who is delivering on his promises against the globalists and against the corrupt elites and special interests like nothing I've ever seen in history.
[1:08:45.720 --> 1:08:56.720]  You have to go back to the lore of Hercules and the Aegean stables to find such a Herculean task being carried out in such a Herculean way.
[1:08:56.720 --> 1:09:03.720]  Only way to describe it.
[1:09:03.720 --> 1:09:21.720]  Well, we're going to get into the latest attempt by the globalist to shut down the free press in this country and worldwide. As you know, in Europe, for the last three, four years, they've been banning people on Facebook, Twitter, Google, restricting them, then finding them, then arresting them.
[1:09:21.720 --> 1:09:35.720]  If you even say there's rapes going on in Germany or in Sweden or in other European countries that have admittedly massive rape epidemics, because that happens in a lot of those Islamic countries.
[1:09:35.720 --> 1:09:51.720]  And so that very anti-free speech systems coming here, but the United States has such an amazing history of the First Amendment that Congress can't even make a law respecting the establishment of religion or free press or the right to assemble or petition the government for redress and grievances.
[1:09:51.720 --> 1:09:55.720]  So what they're doing is weaponizing media with disinformation.
[1:09:55.720 --> 1:10:07.720]  Well, that's discredited. The mainstream media is so bad they are a shadow of their former self. So they're having to go to entertainment, movies, fiction, TV shows like Homeland and Saturday Night Live.
[1:10:07.720 --> 1:10:26.720]  And again, Colbert is the great example, a fake actor, a thespian, playing the part of a fake news anchor or investigative journalist who then exposes fake news of Donald Trump and Alex Jones and then says things we never said or twisted and then says we're liars.
[1:10:26.720 --> 1:10:34.720]  And then hides behind over just entertainment when that happens, even though Colbert's come out and said it's not entertainment now, it's war.
[1:10:34.720 --> 1:10:43.720]  So this is the type of disinformation they're engaging in. Rachel Maddow says that I believe that Obama sent tornadoes to kill people, never said it, can't play a clip of it.
[1:10:43.720 --> 1:10:52.720]  Rachel Maddow says that I believe giant wasp live under the Capitol building or under the U.N. building. She really said that in a serious piece and that I'm deeply racist in the same piece.
[1:10:52.720 --> 1:11:00.720]  Didn't show proof of me being deeply racist. But this is all they can do. This is all they've got.
[1:11:00.720 --> 1:11:13.720]  But now we have Facebook, Google, Twitter, all of them restricting our accounts, not letting us share videos, not letting you share our articles and videos when they're the most critical, credible and hardcore.
[1:11:13.720 --> 1:11:23.720]  When we just do some little silly video or something, oh, they let that go viral. But if it's a CIA section chief saying, I talked to CIA colleagues, they were ordered to go after Trump during and after the election.
[1:11:23.720 --> 1:11:31.720]  And we've got a serious newscast clip and an article and it starts going viral. They just took the whole thing down last week. Have Senator Rand Paul on.
[1:11:31.720 --> 1:11:41.720]  Critical information about how bad this health care bill is. Paul Ryan banned it because it's credible and it was the senator going over what was in the bill.
[1:11:41.720 --> 1:11:48.720]  The same big banks are involved with Facebook and the rest of it that want this screw job that won Obamacare to keep hurting you and your family.
[1:11:48.720 --> 1:12:03.720]  Remember, the Republicans wrote Obamacare with the Democrats. They were bigger progenitors, authors of it. They had more to do with the writing of it, like 80% was the Mitt Romney screw job from Massachusetts.
[1:12:03.720 --> 1:12:14.720]  So then they say, oh, we're just partisan. We don't want Obamacare. It's a screw job and I don't want Paul Ryan's screw job.
[1:12:14.720 --> 1:12:24.720]  Trump's first misstep, I think, is being halfway nice about it. It's a little better in some ways, but worse than others. We need Rand Paul's repeal and replace.
[1:12:24.720 --> 1:12:33.720]  But notice Paul Ryan's trying to hold the country hostage right now. So, so getting into the fake news, first they call us fake news, then they call for us to be shut down.
[1:12:33.720 --> 1:12:39.720]  Then they have Google ban us from advertising on Google through AdRoll. And then now just every day, new shoes are dropping.
[1:12:39.720 --> 1:12:46.720]  Paul Watson article got banned, where they're saying that a father being on TV while his wife took care of the kids was misogynistic on BBC.
[1:12:46.720 --> 1:12:52.720]  He said, how ridiculous. And that video has been blocked on Facebook.
[1:12:52.720 --> 1:13:00.720]  Feminist, furious, funny kid video. That's now been banned. Proof, Facebook is blocking links and forwards. We have the screenshots of it.
[1:13:00.720 --> 1:13:15.720]  So, they said it was spam. Yeah, Paul Watson is one of the top libertarian conservative anti-globalists in the world that has more Twitter impressions than all of the BBC combined.
[1:13:15.720 --> 1:13:24.720]  Paul Watson is spam. That's why everybody wants to open the videos and watch them. That's why they go so viral. No, spam doesn't get open and everybody knows that.
[1:13:24.720 --> 1:13:34.720]  What doesn't get watched or listened to is Hillary Clinton or other globalists like that. I mean, go look when Soros gives a speech, it's on YouTube, 5,000 watch it.
[1:13:34.720 --> 1:13:42.720]  When I give a speech, 5 million watch it. When Paul Watson gives a speech, 5 million, 10 million, 25 million, 35 million watch it.
[1:13:42.720 --> 1:13:55.720]  Oh, is that why I've got 20 plus films, the average film with 10 million views on YouTube? Or more. One film I produced had over 100 million views on Google Video alone.
[1:13:55.720 --> 1:14:02.720]  And they took that down. Oh, it's such spam that hundreds of millions watch it.
[1:14:02.720 --> 1:14:13.720]  And so now, a lot of folks say, hey, Alex, this is good that, you know, Alec Baldwin's attacking you. This is good that they have a show on Homeland where they, you know, have a fake character playing a part of you but saying things you never said.
[1:14:13.720 --> 1:14:25.720]  And I said, you don't understand. They're doing this to set up the climate in the country where I'm hated so they can actually try to sue us and shut us down.
[1:14:25.720 --> 1:14:34.720]  I know for a fact that they tried to get outgoing Lynch to have some indictment and then some criminal action against us during the election.
[1:14:34.720 --> 1:14:46.720]  Pelosi called up and demanded to be done. I had a meeting and I heard this from high level sources and then the next day Pelosi's daughter went on TV and said, Alex Jones death threaded me and he needs to be arrested.
[1:14:46.720 --> 1:14:49.720]  Never. Death threaded her.
[1:14:49.720 --> 1:14:57.720]  I said she was heading up the group trying to get the electors. She said, oh, it's a conspiracy. We're not trying to block Trump getting electors. That's the mind war.
[1:14:57.720 --> 1:15:07.720]  They're openly saying don't elect him electors, block his electoral college official election.
[1:15:07.720 --> 1:15:20.720]  And then they have the nerve to say they never said it, but go further and say I death threaded them. And that's what I was told the day before. Pelosi and her daughter and all them met with Lynch and tried to convince her that I had to somehow be arrested.
[1:15:20.720 --> 1:15:25.720]  That's how crazy these people are.
[1:15:25.720 --> 1:15:29.720]  That's how entitled these people are.
[1:15:29.720 --> 1:15:46.720]  And then I'm told that sessions had to be behind the scenes as the incoming attorney general and telling him we're going to drop those indictments or whatever once we get in if you do it.
[1:15:46.720 --> 1:15:55.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you're one of these little actors that plays Alex Jones and says lies about me, how would you like that about yourself? I know you've dehumanized me and called me a racist and all this crap that other people made up.
[1:15:55.720 --> 1:16:06.720]  But but it's not true. And I'm not putting out fake news. You're the ones that are impersonating me and stealing my identity and the president's identity and hiding behind entertainment.
[1:16:06.720 --> 1:16:15.720]  And this isn't a threat. But karma is real. You reap what you sow. You better get right with God.
[1:16:15.720 --> 1:16:34.720]  Jake Weber from Homeland. Jake Weber from Homeland, born in 1964, gets to come over here and put on his fake Texas accent and they admit in the news they're playing Alex Jones.
[1:16:34.720 --> 1:16:45.720]  And then say and do horrible things. I'm the villain of a major TV show produced by CBS, put on table and then syndicated to television countries and countries all over the world.
[1:16:45.720 --> 1:16:49.720]  And again, this is all the scum can do.
[1:16:49.720 --> 1:17:04.720]  Now understand, they're not going to hurt Alex Jones. They're going to lose their panicking globalisms in trouble all over the world. Nationalists are in the lead all over the planet. Le Pen's about to win. Wilders about to win in the Netherlands.
[1:17:04.720 --> 1:17:18.720]  Italy said no EU expansion. The UK pulled out and Brexit. Iceland six years after pulling out of the globalism has a great economy back. Russia's pulling out of it. The whole world's turning against it.
[1:17:18.720 --> 1:17:23.720]  And so the good news is you're failing.
[1:17:23.720 --> 1:17:33.720]  And so what we're seeing is desperate, panicked, out of control behavior to just tell so many lies because the lies of the election didn't didn't help them and the lies overseas.
[1:17:33.720 --> 1:17:44.720]  So their answer is let's just lie more and let's impersonate Donald Trump every week and have an actor get up there and say and do horrible things in the name of Donald Trump and then just say it's funny.
[1:17:44.720 --> 1:17:59.720]  Oh, I'm Donald Trump. Look, black people aren't humans. They're aliens. And I'm a coward and Alex Jones told me in fours Alex Jones told me black people aren't humans.
[1:17:59.720 --> 1:18:02.720]  And it goes on and on and on.
[1:18:02.720 --> 1:18:04.720]  Oh, look, Cole.
[1:18:04.720 --> 1:18:10.720]  That's my answer to the alien invasion. But the whole thing I'm about to play the SNL piece and stop and start it.
[1:18:10.720 --> 1:18:17.720]  We'll play the homeland piece. The whole thing is a construction of lies. Globalism is the alien force that's taken over our country.
[1:18:17.720 --> 1:18:21.720]  Globalism is what is attacking a human based economy and replacing us with robots.
[1:18:21.720 --> 1:18:25.720]  Globalism is the outside alien psychopathic world government system.
[1:18:25.720 --> 1:18:30.720]  Cole, it was how we get our jobs and industry back and why our electricity used to be the cheapest in the world.
[1:18:30.720 --> 1:18:33.720]  Now it's some of the most expensive. It's clean. It's good.
[1:18:33.720 --> 1:18:37.720]  So the energy source is important. They make a joke about that, though.
[1:18:37.720 --> 1:18:41.720]  An outside enemy force would shut off our power.
[1:18:41.720 --> 1:18:45.720]  And then he goes on and on and on.
[1:18:45.720 --> 1:18:49.720]  They go on to say, take me to your leader and Trump's scared and runs offices.
[1:18:49.720 --> 1:18:52.720]  I'm not the leader when he's the one that marches at the head of the motorcade.
[1:18:52.720 --> 1:18:56.720]  When he's the one that has all that courage.
[1:18:56.720 --> 1:19:03.720]  When he's the one that's let them attack his companies, his families, gone through all this hell, stood up against the media and beat them in political correctness and they can't stand it.
[1:19:03.720 --> 1:19:07.720]  So they say in the piece and every week, I guess is what they do. I've seen a few other skits.
[1:19:07.720 --> 1:19:11.720]  He's always a coward in the skits because that's the opposite of who he is.
[1:19:11.720 --> 1:19:18.720]  And it's meant to defame someone that's honorable and really trying to empower the people and it's disgusting.
[1:19:18.720 --> 1:19:22.720]  So I actually feel sad for Alec Baldwin.
[1:19:22.720 --> 1:19:26.720]  But Jake Weber is even worse.
[1:19:26.720 --> 1:19:30.720]  I mean, you talk about...
[1:19:30.720 --> 1:19:38.720]  They've got these endless fields of want to be actors and people that think if they could finally just get on TV or getting movies, they would be somebody.
[1:19:38.720 --> 1:19:41.720]  And they're just all in their narcissistic crap.
[1:19:41.720 --> 1:19:45.720]  I have a purpose driven life. I'm doing this because I want to change the world for humanity.
[1:19:45.720 --> 1:19:48.720]  I don't want to be turned into a slave.
[1:19:48.720 --> 1:19:51.720]  And you sit there and you plagiarize what I say word for word.
[1:19:51.720 --> 1:19:59.720]  And then your writers, I think there's a case here, put their names on the scripts that then you go read.
[1:19:59.720 --> 1:20:02.720]  And 90% of it's what I say word for word.
[1:20:02.720 --> 1:20:04.720]  And then you add the lies.
[1:20:04.720 --> 1:20:07.720]  You add the fake news.
[1:20:07.720 --> 1:20:19.720]  That's defamation. That's plagiarism. And it's despicable.
[1:20:19.720 --> 1:20:24.720]  I wish Jake Weber would do the things and say the things he says I'm saying to my face.
[1:20:24.720 --> 1:20:29.720]  Man up. Meet me out in the parking lot somewhere.
[1:20:29.720 --> 1:20:32.720]  If you won't do that, you little yellow-bellied bastard.
[1:20:32.720 --> 1:20:38.720]  It's worse than telling lies about somebody. You sit up there with weak-minded viewers, you're preying on you little predator.
[1:20:38.720 --> 1:20:40.720]  You're just a whore, though.
[1:20:40.720 --> 1:20:45.720]  It's the people above you that are the predators, the writers and the controllers and the dirtbags in Hollywood.
[1:20:45.720 --> 1:20:53.720]  And their whole failing system is they lift up their skirt and beg the communists, Chinese murderers to come stick their, you know, snout under the tent flap and get in there
[1:20:53.720 --> 1:20:55.720]  and give you some new political blood.
[1:20:55.720 --> 1:20:57.720]  You're a bunch of losers.
[1:20:57.720 --> 1:20:59.720]  And I love the fact Hollywood's imploding.
[1:20:59.720 --> 1:21:01.720]  And I love the fact your system's falling apart.
[1:21:01.720 --> 1:21:08.720]  And I love the fact you're so scared because you're scum and you come from trash and you'll always be trash.
[1:21:08.720 --> 1:21:10.720]  I hate your guts.
[1:21:10.720 --> 1:21:13.720]  The Communist Chinese have killed over 100 million of their own people.
[1:21:13.720 --> 1:21:17.720]  And they're basically financing most of these shows against myself and Trump.
[1:21:17.720 --> 1:21:26.720]  The new Michael Bay movie, again, where Trump's a dictator and U.S. special forces turn against him with the Chinese and kill the president.
[1:21:26.720 --> 1:21:31.720]  Man, you've really chosen some sick sides.
[1:21:31.720 --> 1:21:34.720]  You've chosen the people that prop up North Korea.
[1:21:34.720 --> 1:21:36.720]  Jake Weber.
[1:21:36.720 --> 1:21:43.720]  Yeah, you bet I don't like you because I know you're a little authoritarian that if they arrested me and put me in prison and put my family in prison,
[1:21:43.720 --> 1:21:49.720]  hell, if they killed me, if they hung me in public, you'd get up there and probably read off a script.
[1:21:49.720 --> 1:21:55.720]  And then Jones said he hated Jesus and he hated black people and he hates Jews and he hates everybody else.
[1:21:55.720 --> 1:21:56.720]  And he's a pedophile.
[1:21:56.720 --> 1:21:59.720]  And then you kick the lever and hang me right in front of my kids.
[1:21:59.720 --> 1:22:01.720]  Well, I kicked out hanging.
[1:22:01.720 --> 1:22:04.720]  Wouldn't you, you son of a piece of garbage?
[1:22:04.720 --> 1:22:05.720]  You would.
[1:22:05.720 --> 1:22:07.720]  You're a little wimp.
[1:22:07.720 --> 1:22:14.720]  You love evil, you love tyranny, and I pray to God that God line you up.
[1:22:14.720 --> 1:22:16.720]  I ask God, I'm so sick of these people.
[1:22:16.720 --> 1:22:17.720]  It's not what they're doing to me.
[1:22:17.720 --> 1:22:24.720]  What they're doing to the, and I just, God, I never asked you for anything, but I just wish you teach these writers today the fear of God.
[1:22:24.720 --> 1:22:28.720]  How they back up the murdering communist Chinese and every other form of evil.
[1:22:28.720 --> 1:22:36.720]  They're just a pack of rats ready to do whatever it takes and sell their grandmother out to hell for a stick of bubble gum.
[1:22:36.720 --> 1:22:42.720]  Dishonorable trash.
[1:22:42.720 --> 1:22:44.720]  Liars.
[1:22:44.720 --> 1:22:45.720]  Deceivers.
[1:22:45.720 --> 1:22:47.720]  Snakes.
[1:22:47.720 --> 1:22:55.720]  Getting together with their all wimpy cast and, you know, screwing around and giggling and laughing when he does the Alex Jones limitations that are so bad.
[1:22:55.720 --> 1:22:56.720]  Oh, good job, good job.
[1:22:56.720 --> 1:22:57.720]  You fought.
[1:22:57.720 --> 1:22:59.720]  You fought that racist good.
[1:22:59.720 --> 1:23:01.720]  You're all a lot of yourselves about what you're doing.
[1:23:01.720 --> 1:23:06.720]  You're trash.
[1:23:06.720 --> 1:23:07.720]  God, you're trash.
[1:23:07.720 --> 1:23:09.720]  Let's go to the Alec Baldwin piece.
[1:23:09.720 --> 1:23:10.720]  I'll try to just start and stop.
[1:23:10.720 --> 1:23:13.720]  I've already made my point, but it's just incredible.
[1:23:13.720 --> 1:23:24.720]  Oh, and they say Trump doesn't know the Pledge of Allegiance in this when it's Hillary that had in God we trust or one nation under God taken out and Obama who wouldn't put his hand over his heart.
[1:23:24.720 --> 1:23:28.720]  It's like everything they say about us is what they do.
[1:23:28.720 --> 1:23:31.720]  No one can say Donald Trump's a coward who lives in the real world.
[1:23:31.720 --> 1:23:33.720]  I notice they call me a coward all over the news.
[1:23:33.720 --> 1:23:35.720]  I love it on the little anonymous message board.
[1:23:35.720 --> 1:23:36.720]  That's their favorite meme.
[1:23:36.720 --> 1:23:37.720]  Coward, coward.
[1:23:37.720 --> 1:23:38.720]  Oh, yeah, I'm a big coward.
[1:23:38.720 --> 1:23:39.720]  That's right.
[1:23:39.720 --> 1:23:41.720]  The truth is we're changing the world.
[1:23:41.720 --> 1:23:42.720]  Our listeners are changing the world.
[1:23:42.720 --> 1:23:44.720]  We actually care about humanity.
[1:23:44.720 --> 1:23:47.720]  We tell the truth and your system is dead.
[1:23:47.720 --> 1:23:49.720]  You are a political carcass.
[1:23:49.720 --> 1:23:54.720]  There's not even flesh on the bones.
[1:23:54.720 --> 1:23:57.720]  You see this Weber and you see this Alec Baldwin.
[1:23:57.720 --> 1:24:08.720]  Turn back now because the road you're going down is cultural and spiritual and moral death.
[1:24:08.720 --> 1:24:11.720]  Now, let's start the Saturday Night Live piece.
[1:24:11.720 --> 1:24:15.720]  Here it is.
[1:24:15.720 --> 1:24:20.720]  In the year 2018, aliens from the planet Zorblat 9 landed on Earth.
[1:24:20.720 --> 1:24:25.720]  They did not come in peace.
[1:24:25.720 --> 1:24:32.720]  Men, women, the hour is upon us.
[1:24:32.720 --> 1:24:33.720]  I didn't get actions.
[1:24:33.720 --> 1:24:35.720]  It's just a bunch of chumps.
[1:24:35.720 --> 1:24:37.720]  Closing a military base for real history.
[1:24:37.720 --> 1:24:39.720]  The genes are stronger than we thought.
[1:24:39.720 --> 1:24:42.720]  Which means the fight for humanity begins now.
[1:24:42.720 --> 1:24:45.720]  We may be down, but we are not.
[1:24:45.720 --> 1:24:48.720]  Back in the fight for humanity, Trump wants a pro-human world.
[1:24:48.720 --> 1:24:51.720]  A world where people have jobs, where we have communities.
[1:24:51.720 --> 1:24:52.720]  The globalists are all anti-humans.
[1:24:52.720 --> 1:24:55.720]  So notice, aliens are attacking, Trump's actually working with them.
[1:24:55.720 --> 1:24:58.720]  The aliens are supposedly Russians, Zorblat 9.
[1:24:58.720 --> 1:24:59.720]  So it's that whole parallel.
[1:24:59.720 --> 1:25:02.720]  When it's not Russia trying to take over America, it's the globalists.
[1:25:02.720 --> 1:25:03.720]  It's globalism, see?
[1:25:03.720 --> 1:25:05.720]  So that's why everything's an inversion of reality.
[1:25:05.720 --> 1:25:08.720]  And their riders can't even come up with their own ideas.
[1:25:08.720 --> 1:25:11.720]  They just take what's really happening and we're fighting and they invert it.
[1:25:11.720 --> 1:25:13.720]  Let's go back to these pieces of garbage.
[1:25:13.720 --> 1:25:16.720]  But we are not out.
[1:25:16.720 --> 1:25:18.720]  We've lost limbs.
[1:25:18.720 --> 1:25:20.720]  We've lost lives.
[1:25:20.720 --> 1:25:24.720]  But we will not lose the United States of America.
[1:25:24.720 --> 1:25:26.720]  Now let's get out there.
[1:25:26.720 --> 1:25:27.720]  Destroy those aliens.
[1:25:27.720 --> 1:25:29.720]  I was just pausing in.
[1:25:29.720 --> 1:25:31.720]  Major schools all over the U.S.
[1:25:31.720 --> 1:25:33.720]  It's been announced they're banning American flags.
[1:25:33.720 --> 1:25:36.720]  They're being banned at sporting events because, quote,
[1:25:36.720 --> 1:25:39.720]  refugees don't like them and think it's racist or anti-refugee.
[1:25:39.720 --> 1:25:41.720]  The Muslims get scared seeing it.
[1:25:41.720 --> 1:25:43.720]  I'm not getting that to the news today.
[1:25:43.720 --> 1:25:46.720]  And the Night Circuit banned American flags at schools in California.
[1:25:46.720 --> 1:25:49.720]  And they're always the ones saying F the USA at their rallies.
[1:25:49.720 --> 1:25:51.720]  But see now, they're for America.
[1:25:51.720 --> 1:25:52.720]  They're for USA.
[1:25:52.720 --> 1:25:53.720]  They're the liberals.
[1:25:53.720 --> 1:25:56.720]  And Donald Trump, he's with the aliens slash the Russians.
[1:25:56.720 --> 1:26:00.720]  See, everything a upside down world.
[1:26:00.720 --> 1:26:03.720]  I wonder if these people actually write backwards, too.
[1:26:03.720 --> 1:26:04.720]  And maybe talk backwards.
[1:26:04.720 --> 1:26:05.720]  I've heard of that before.
[1:26:05.720 --> 1:26:06.720]  Who does that?
[1:26:06.720 --> 1:26:31.720]  Let's go back to the pure garbage.
[1:26:31.720 --> 1:26:33.720]  They're probably trying to hit pause again.
[1:26:33.720 --> 1:26:34.720]  Back it up.
[1:26:34.720 --> 1:26:38.720]  They always try to copyright us, like when Colbert attacks us or another Jimmy,
[1:26:38.720 --> 1:26:40.720]  whatever his name is, Kimmel attacks us.
[1:26:40.720 --> 1:26:43.720]  They're talking about us dumbasses in NBC.
[1:26:43.720 --> 1:26:46.720]  We have total fair use to cover this and respond to it.
[1:26:46.720 --> 1:26:49.720]  And I'm really thinking about Sue and Smiley the next time they put in a fake
[1:26:49.720 --> 1:26:51.720]  garbage complaint on us.
[1:26:51.720 --> 1:26:54.720]  Again, you want to trash us all day and then try to shut down our channels
[1:26:54.720 --> 1:26:56.720]  to counter your stinking garbage filth?
[1:26:56.720 --> 1:26:58.720]  We're going to do it, dirtbags.
[1:26:58.720 --> 1:26:59.720]  The anti-American garbage.
[1:26:59.720 --> 1:27:01.720]  Get that through your stinking heads.
[1:27:01.720 --> 1:27:07.720]  Do it.
[1:27:07.720 --> 1:27:08.720]  Hello, yes.
[1:27:08.720 --> 1:27:10.720]  What a beautiful day.
[1:27:10.720 --> 1:27:12.720]  Who here loves Trump?
[1:27:12.720 --> 1:27:13.720]  I know this guy over here.
[1:27:13.720 --> 1:27:15.720]  He loves Trump.
[1:27:15.720 --> 1:27:16.720]  Oh, look, oh, hit pause.
[1:27:16.720 --> 1:27:19.720]  Yeah, basically only dead people like Trump.
[1:27:19.720 --> 1:27:25.720]  Smoking dead bodies, laser-meamed, disintegrated by the aliens.
[1:27:25.720 --> 1:27:27.720]  So again, you're with Trump.
[1:27:27.720 --> 1:27:28.720]  You're dead.
[1:27:28.720 --> 1:27:29.720]  Just the most base psychology.
[1:27:29.720 --> 1:27:30.720]  Here we go.
[1:27:30.720 --> 1:27:31.720]  Now, here's the deal.
[1:27:31.720 --> 1:27:36.720]  We are going to beat these aliens because we have got the best military.
[1:27:36.720 --> 1:27:39.720]  But we don't win anymore.
[1:27:39.720 --> 1:27:41.720]  And the aliens are laughing at us.
[1:27:41.720 --> 1:27:44.720]  They're killing us, and they're laughing at us.
[1:27:44.720 --> 1:27:46.720]  We know the aliens are killing us, sir.
[1:27:46.720 --> 1:27:49.720]  They have the most advanced weaponized technology we've ever seen.
[1:27:49.720 --> 1:27:50.720]  What should we do?
[1:27:50.720 --> 1:27:51.720]  Okay, here's what we do.
[1:27:51.720 --> 1:27:53.720]  Here's what we're going to do.
[1:27:53.720 --> 1:27:56.720]  We are going to bring coal back, okay?
[1:27:56.720 --> 1:28:01.720]  Again, the globalists, their whole plans shut off coal worldwide because there's a buff
[1:28:01.720 --> 1:28:03.720]  coal again for thousands of years conservatively.
[1:28:03.720 --> 1:28:05.720]  We have some of the biggest reserves of it.
[1:28:05.720 --> 1:28:06.720]  It's totally clean, totally good.
[1:28:06.720 --> 1:28:07.720]  Good for the earth.
[1:28:07.720 --> 1:28:08.720]  We need more carbon dioxide.
[1:28:08.720 --> 1:28:09.720]  We're actually a lot lower than we were.
[1:28:09.720 --> 1:28:12.720]  Millions of years ago, that's in all the studies, ice core samples, you name it.
[1:28:12.720 --> 1:28:15.720]  Again, they're really pissed about that because that's the one thing that's got all the jobs
[1:28:15.720 --> 1:28:16.720]  pouring back in.
[1:28:16.720 --> 1:28:19.720]  This is going to be competitive now on energy prices for manufacturing.
[1:28:19.720 --> 1:28:23.720]  So that's why they're so pissed that they make a joke to the dumb audience that doesn't
[1:28:23.720 --> 1:28:25.720]  understand how electricity takes place.
[1:28:25.720 --> 1:28:27.720]  Here's what we're going to do.
[1:28:27.720 --> 1:28:31.720]  We are going to bring coal back, okay?
[1:28:31.720 --> 1:28:33.720]  We're going to have so much coal.
[1:28:33.720 --> 1:28:35.720]  You're going to say, where did all this coal come from?
[1:28:35.720 --> 1:28:38.720]  I never knew there could be so much coal.
[1:28:38.720 --> 1:28:41.720]  But, Mr. President, what about the aliens?
[1:28:41.720 --> 1:28:43.720]  They just vaporized the entire state of California.
[1:28:43.720 --> 1:28:46.720]  So did I win the popular vote?
[1:28:46.720 --> 1:28:51.720]  That's to bring back that he didn't win the popular vote in that state, but he really
[1:28:51.720 --> 1:28:52.720]  did because of all the illegal voting.
[1:28:52.720 --> 1:28:56.720]  If you had it all together with other states, but again, everything's a jab, jab, jab, jab,
[1:28:56.720 --> 1:28:58.720]  jab, mixing in all their deception.
[1:28:58.720 --> 1:29:00.720]  Continue.
[1:29:00.720 --> 1:29:05.720]  Sir, please, everyone in California is dead.
[1:29:05.720 --> 1:29:08.720]  Even Arnold.
[1:29:08.720 --> 1:29:12.720]  Sir, yes, we are dealing with a highly advanced species here.
[1:29:12.720 --> 1:29:14.720]  They're from Zorblat 9.
[1:29:14.720 --> 1:29:15.720]  Their ships are invisible.
[1:29:15.720 --> 1:29:16.720]  They're telepathic.
[1:29:16.720 --> 1:29:17.720]  Okay.
[1:29:17.720 --> 1:29:20.720]  No, we don't know that they are from Zorblat 9.
[1:29:20.720 --> 1:29:24.720]  I've actually heard Zorblat 9 is very beautiful, very fantastic.
[1:29:24.720 --> 1:29:25.720]  That's pretty funny.
[1:29:25.720 --> 1:29:26.720]  Oh, my God.
[1:29:26.720 --> 1:29:28.720]  Does he have business ties on Zorblat 9?
[1:29:28.720 --> 1:29:30.720]  All right, pause again.
[1:29:30.720 --> 1:29:32.720]  So the aliens are attacking.
[1:29:32.720 --> 1:29:35.720]  And now that it's the Russians, he sold us out to the Russians.
[1:29:35.720 --> 1:29:39.720]  Again, it's the globalists that are openly ending sovereignty, TPP, all these deals
[1:29:39.720 --> 1:29:41.720]  that transfer our power out of the country.
[1:29:41.720 --> 1:29:42.720]  Total treason.
[1:29:42.720 --> 1:29:43.720]  Trump killed all that.
[1:29:43.720 --> 1:29:46.720]  But they're claiming he's selling us out to foreign interest.
[1:29:46.720 --> 1:29:48.720]  When it's the opposite, that's why the globalists are so angry.
[1:29:48.720 --> 1:29:50.720]  We're going to finish up where he attacks us.
[1:29:50.720 --> 1:29:51.720]  We're on the march.
[1:29:51.720 --> 1:29:53.720]  The Empire's on the run.
[1:29:53.720 --> 1:30:01.720]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:30:01.720 --> 1:30:04.720]  Well, folks, America is now offensive in America.
[1:30:04.720 --> 1:30:08.720]  At a high school basketball game in Des Moines, Iowa, the students from Valley High decided
[1:30:08.720 --> 1:30:11.720]  to have a USA themed crowd and wore red, white, and blue.
[1:30:11.720 --> 1:30:16.720]  Despite winning the game, they lost in social justice as coaches and fans of the other team
[1:30:16.720 --> 1:30:18.720]  were offended by the patriotic attire.
[1:30:18.720 --> 1:30:24.720]  See, Des Moines North is said to have 66% minority enrollment, compared to the 26% at Valley.
[1:30:24.720 --> 1:30:28.720]  As if saying one school as a majority minority isn't crazy enough, now they're saying
[1:30:28.720 --> 1:30:32.720]  it's offensive to wear red, white, and blue if you play against this school.
[1:30:32.720 --> 1:30:35.720]  The biggest issue was that there was a refugee on the North roster,
[1:30:35.720 --> 1:30:38.720]  but you'd think he would embrace the country that embraced him.
[1:30:38.720 --> 1:30:43.720]  This is a trend, as last year, Ramapo College vetoed an American themed barbecue
[1:30:43.720 --> 1:30:46.720]  hosted by college Republicans and college Democrats.
[1:30:46.720 --> 1:30:50.720]  So we can't even come together in patriotism under these liberals.
[1:30:50.720 --> 1:30:52.720]  What is wrong with these people?
[1:30:52.720 --> 1:30:54.720]  Next, they're going to want to remove the flag.
[1:30:54.720 --> 1:31:23.720]  This is Owen Schreuer for Infowars.com, proud to be an American.
[1:31:24.720 --> 1:31:27.720]  Go out to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children,
[1:31:27.720 --> 1:31:30.720]  do the best job you can to purify your air.
[1:31:30.720 --> 1:31:34.720]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things
[1:31:34.720 --> 1:31:38.720]  that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[1:31:38.720 --> 1:31:40.720]  The general public hasn't.
[1:31:40.720 --> 1:31:44.720]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[1:31:44.720 --> 1:31:48.720]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[1:31:48.720 --> 1:31:50.720]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house,
[1:31:50.720 --> 1:31:54.720]  replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[1:31:54.720 --> 1:32:00.720]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfowarsStore.com.
[1:32:00.720 --> 1:32:05.720]  We have the new product at InfowarsLife.com, Biotru Selenium.
[1:32:05.720 --> 1:32:08.720]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium,
[1:32:08.720 --> 1:32:14.720]  and just recently we were able to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium
[1:32:14.720 --> 1:32:16.720]  from Mustard Seed Extract.
[1:32:16.720 --> 1:32:21.720]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[1:32:21.720 --> 1:32:25.720]  It helps balance the thyroid gland, it helps detoxify.
[1:32:25.720 --> 1:32:28.720]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[1:32:28.720 --> 1:32:31.720]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland,
[1:32:31.720 --> 1:32:33.720]  but it's actually used all over the body.
[1:32:33.720 --> 1:32:39.720]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[1:32:39.720 --> 1:32:45.720]  So it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[1:32:45.720 --> 1:32:50.720]  We're taking it now every day. This is soaking. Biotru Selenium is the product,
[1:32:50.720 --> 1:32:52.720]  the best selenium that we could bring.
[1:32:52.720 --> 1:32:54.720]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[1:32:54.720 --> 1:32:58.720]  Exclusively available at InfowarsLife.com or by calling toll-free,
[1:32:58.720 --> 1:33:26.720]  1-800-253-3139.
[1:33:26.720 --> 1:33:30.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, the globalists, as you know, with the herbicides and pesticides,
[1:33:30.720 --> 1:33:32.720]  are bombarding our guts.
[1:33:32.720 --> 1:33:36.720]  And so that kills the good bacteria, the bad bacteria, the mutated bacteria,
[1:33:36.720 --> 1:33:37.720]  move into place there.
[1:33:37.720 --> 1:33:39.720]  That's why good probiotics are so important.
[1:33:39.720 --> 1:33:43.720]  InfowarsLife has developed with top researchers and scientists
[1:33:43.720 --> 1:33:48.720]  what we believe is the very best high-end, super-high-quality, probiotic, biome defense,
[1:33:48.720 --> 1:33:50.720]  50 billion per capsule culture.
[1:33:50.720 --> 1:33:52.720]  We keep it cold here, ship it out to you cold.
[1:33:52.720 --> 1:33:54.720]  It doesn't lose a lot of its potency if it gets warmed up,
[1:33:54.720 --> 1:33:56.720]  but it's good to keep it in your refrigerator.
[1:33:56.720 --> 1:33:59.720]  And we have 25 billion culture half-strength.
[1:33:59.720 --> 1:34:01.720]  We have regular strength and extra strength.
[1:34:01.720 --> 1:34:05.720]  And then MycoZX is about to sell out, and I need to fund our operation,
[1:34:05.720 --> 1:34:07.720]  so I like to discount things out of the gates.
[1:34:07.720 --> 1:34:10.720]  But it'll probably be six weeks till we get more of this in,
[1:34:10.720 --> 1:34:11.720]  because it's so hard to source.
[1:34:11.720 --> 1:34:12.720]  It's so organic.
[1:34:12.720 --> 1:34:14.720]  It's tested up to California standards,
[1:34:14.720 --> 1:34:16.720]  which is very hard to get through those hoops.
[1:34:16.720 --> 1:34:21.720]  But it's MycoZX, the antifungal, anti-yeast, Candida, you name it,
[1:34:21.720 --> 1:34:24.720]  very best formula out there, top of the line.
[1:34:24.720 --> 1:34:26.720]  You can get those together for 10% off.
[1:34:26.720 --> 1:34:30.720]  But that discount is going to end at 2 o'clock today.
[1:34:30.720 --> 1:34:33.720]  I'm going to end the special at 2 o'clock today,
[1:34:33.720 --> 1:34:36.720]  because it's about to sell out, and quite frankly,
[1:34:36.720 --> 1:34:39.720]  I would actually like to bring some more money in here to hire more reporters
[1:34:39.720 --> 1:34:43.720]  and more crew, especially when we got kicked off of Google advertising.
[1:34:43.720 --> 1:34:46.720]  Yeah, I would go out and advertise products outside of my show
[1:34:46.720 --> 1:34:48.720]  to bring money in to fund the operation.
[1:34:48.720 --> 1:34:52.720]  And we're at a shortfall now because of the massive sustained economic attacks
[1:34:52.720 --> 1:34:56.720]  we're under, but the listeners in just two weeks have almost narrowed that gap.
[1:34:56.720 --> 1:34:59.720]  So thank you all for the support, and for all of you listening,
[1:34:59.720 --> 1:35:02.720]  and for all of you that open the emails, you get the biggest discounts out there.
[1:35:02.720 --> 1:35:05.720]  50% off on SuperfemaleVitality today.
[1:35:05.720 --> 1:35:08.720]  Give your an infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[1:35:08.720 --> 1:35:10.720]  Subscriber, it's absolutely free, and now more than ever.
[1:35:10.720 --> 1:35:13.720]  I've never was big on email, because I was all about viral stuff elsewhere.
[1:35:13.720 --> 1:35:16.720]  You notice I've been pushing this hard, because all the experts say,
[1:35:16.720 --> 1:35:18.720]  hey, Joe Jones, you've got to grow your giant email list
[1:35:18.720 --> 1:35:20.720]  when this censorship intensifies.
[1:35:20.720 --> 1:35:22.720]  You could be in a foreign country and still shoot videos
[1:35:22.720 --> 1:35:25.720]  and still send articles to people, and it's very hard for them to censor this.
[1:35:25.720 --> 1:35:30.720]  So we're going into a real mode like we're in the old Soviet Union.
[1:35:30.720 --> 1:35:33.720]  And they're all over the news saying they want to shut us down,
[1:35:33.720 --> 1:35:36.720]  and they want to shut down, you know, take Trump's Twitter away,
[1:35:36.720 --> 1:35:38.720]  and they're actually starting to do it.
[1:35:38.720 --> 1:35:42.720]  Not let his tweets get out to his, you know, all his followers blocking
[1:35:42.720 --> 1:35:45.720]  all the positive comments and stuff he gets feedback from,
[1:35:45.720 --> 1:35:48.720]  all the ideas he feeds off you feeding off him.
[1:35:48.720 --> 1:35:49.720]  It's synergistic.
[1:35:49.720 --> 1:35:51.720]  So they're really trying to block us right now.
[1:35:51.720 --> 1:35:53.720]  The article's on infowars.com.
[1:35:53.720 --> 1:35:55.720]  Proof Facebook is blocking links to infowars.com.
[1:35:55.720 --> 1:35:57.720]  Everything's got free shipping until tomorrow.
[1:35:57.720 --> 1:35:59.720]  We're going to end it tomorrow evening,
[1:35:59.720 --> 1:36:02.720]  and normally you have $50 or more free shipping, everything.
[1:36:02.720 --> 1:36:05.720]  Whether it's a $9.95 coil silver or a book, this $9.95,
[1:36:05.720 --> 1:36:09.720]  or, you know, whether it's a MyCo, a ZX, anti-fungal, whatever,
[1:36:09.720 --> 1:36:11.720]  everything is free shipping right now.
[1:36:11.720 --> 1:36:17.720]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, or AAA-253-3139.
[1:36:17.720 --> 1:36:20.720]  Livestraw, great in-the-field survival straw.
[1:36:20.720 --> 1:36:22.720]  It is 30% off right now.
[1:36:22.720 --> 1:36:25.720]  A lot of specials at infowarsstore.com.
[1:36:25.720 --> 1:36:28.720]  But bottom line, thank you all for supporting the broadcast.
[1:36:28.720 --> 1:36:33.720]  At $15.95, you can't beat the Livestraw, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:36:33.720 --> 1:36:36.720]  And it's one of the top-rated survival straws out there.
[1:36:36.720 --> 1:36:39.720]  And it's just great even if you're drinking, you know, tap water with ice.
[1:36:39.720 --> 1:36:41.720]  You can fill in a station or whatever, a cafe.
[1:36:41.720 --> 1:36:44.720]  You can filter this in just a minute or so in another glass
[1:36:44.720 --> 1:36:50.720]  and cut out 99.999% of the fluoride, the bromine, the bacteria, the garbage.
[1:36:50.720 --> 1:36:54.720]  And that's the biggest thing your body faces is the contaminated tap water.
[1:36:54.720 --> 1:36:57.720]  Believe me, the elites all filter their waters and you should, too.
[1:36:57.720 --> 1:36:59.720]  Infowarsstore.com is the main site.
[1:36:59.720 --> 1:37:06.720]  Subpages, infowarslife.com, AAA-253-3139.
[1:37:06.720 --> 1:37:08.720]  And we have 50% off out of the gates.
[1:37:08.720 --> 1:37:11.720]  The Trump Pence 2020 shirt to help spread free speech,
[1:37:11.720 --> 1:37:13.720]  stand up for the bullies and meet like-minded people,
[1:37:13.720 --> 1:37:17.720]  keeping America great, right-hand shoulder, infowars.com on the back.
[1:37:17.720 --> 1:37:22.720]  America First in 1776, infowars.com.
[1:37:22.720 --> 1:37:25.720]  Those are still at $9.95.
[1:37:25.720 --> 1:37:28.720]  But they are going to go up next week to the full $19.95.
[1:37:28.720 --> 1:37:30.720]  And this is the new viral shirt.
[1:37:30.720 --> 1:37:32.720]  I want to thank everybody for getting so many of them.
[1:37:32.720 --> 1:37:35.720]  Last time, it had a huge effect with our Hillary for Prison shirt.
[1:37:35.720 --> 1:37:38.720]  Everybody has that same navy blue design.
[1:37:38.720 --> 1:37:39.720]  Looks really good.
[1:37:39.720 --> 1:37:40.720]  Looks like a campaign shirt.
[1:37:40.720 --> 1:37:42.720]  It is important for everybody to get it.
[1:37:42.720 --> 1:37:44.720]  All right, let's just stop right there.
[1:37:44.720 --> 1:37:46.720]  I mean, it's a fight between we the people and the globalists.
[1:37:46.720 --> 1:37:48.720]  And that's why you see history changing.
[1:37:48.720 --> 1:37:50.720]  That's why you see them freaking out so bad.
[1:37:50.720 --> 1:37:53.720]  It's why you see them openly saying kill Trump and Snoop Dogg saying kill Trump
[1:37:53.720 --> 1:37:57.720]  and putting it out on MTV and then allowing that on air.
[1:37:57.720 --> 1:38:00.720]  Because they're openly trying to trick us into a civil war.
[1:38:00.720 --> 1:38:03.720]  The new Michael Brown edited video.
[1:38:03.720 --> 1:38:07.720]  All this stuff is to try to get riots going because that's all the globalists have.
[1:38:07.720 --> 1:38:11.720]  And they're really praying on inner city communities and manipulating them.
[1:38:11.720 --> 1:38:13.720]  But that's what the globalists do.
[1:38:13.720 --> 1:38:16.720]  Like Zuckerberg said, thank God my users are dumb efforts.
[1:38:16.720 --> 1:38:18.720]  He said they trust me. Ha ha.
[1:38:18.720 --> 1:38:20.720]  Thank God they're dumb efforts.
[1:38:20.720 --> 1:38:21.720]  What did Gruber say about Obamacare?
[1:38:21.720 --> 1:38:22.720]  Thank God they're so dumb.
[1:38:22.720 --> 1:38:24.720]  Thank God they don't have attention spans.
[1:38:24.720 --> 1:38:25.720]  Thank God.
[1:38:25.720 --> 1:38:28.720]  That's why they're on the news today saying no one ever fired U.S. attorneys.
[1:38:28.720 --> 1:38:30.720]  It's totally insane.
[1:38:30.720 --> 1:38:32.720]  Oh my gosh, here's the headline.
[1:38:32.720 --> 1:38:35.720]  Anger mounts over handling of U.S. attorney firings.
[1:38:35.720 --> 1:38:37.720]  He fires 46. Does he want to do their job?
[1:38:37.720 --> 1:38:39.720]  They're not loyal.
[1:38:39.720 --> 1:38:42.720]  Bill Clinton fired 93 in one day.
[1:38:42.720 --> 1:38:44.720]  And laughed about it.
[1:38:44.720 --> 1:38:48.720]  I'll give the muscle seekers to my bosses in China now.
[1:38:48.720 --> 1:38:51.720]  Remember New York Times?
[1:38:51.720 --> 1:38:53.720]  Oh, we never said there was any wiretaps.
[1:38:53.720 --> 1:38:54.720]  Oh, really?
[1:38:54.720 --> 1:38:56.720]  January 20th and hundreds of other headlines.
[1:38:56.720 --> 1:38:58.720]  Oh, just so happened to have a copy of it.
[1:38:58.720 --> 1:39:01.720]  But months later you said you never did in March 4th.
[1:39:01.720 --> 1:39:02.720]  Is that fake news?
[1:39:02.720 --> 1:39:05.720]  Yes, it's real news reporting on fake news.
[1:39:05.720 --> 1:39:08.720]  The New York Times.
[1:39:08.720 --> 1:39:10.720]  The New York Times just two months ago said,
[1:39:10.720 --> 1:39:13.720]  is globalism real that Alex Jones talks about?
[1:39:13.720 --> 1:39:15.720]  Or is he insane?
[1:39:15.720 --> 1:39:17.720]  They basically said it doesn't exist.
[1:39:17.720 --> 1:39:19.720]  But a month later they said, look, we fail.
[1:39:19.720 --> 1:39:20.720]  We have to admit it.
[1:39:20.720 --> 1:39:21.720]  Globalism's falling apart.
[1:39:21.720 --> 1:39:22.720]  What are we going to do?
[1:39:22.720 --> 1:39:25.720]  Oh my gosh, our world government, they're on to us.
[1:39:25.720 --> 1:39:28.720]  They kept playing this Jedi mind trick of there's no global government.
[1:39:28.720 --> 1:39:29.720]  There's no Davos.
[1:39:29.720 --> 1:39:30.720]  There's no Bilderberg.
[1:39:30.720 --> 1:39:31.720]  There's no TPP.
[1:39:31.720 --> 1:39:32.720]  No Congress.
[1:39:32.720 --> 1:39:33.720]  Can't see it.
[1:39:33.720 --> 1:39:34.720]  It's a real thing, but it's secret.
[1:39:34.720 --> 1:39:37.720]  Okay, it transfers all your sovereignty over, but it's okay.
[1:39:37.720 --> 1:39:40.720]  Because nobody's watching mainstream media.
[1:39:40.720 --> 1:39:43.720]  Oh, we'll just put on mainstream entertainment.
[1:39:43.720 --> 1:39:47.720]  Almost no one's watching mainstream news.
[1:39:47.720 --> 1:39:51.720]  But they are watching mainstream entertainment like Alec Baldwin.
[1:39:51.720 --> 1:39:54.720]  So let's get back to this in the homeland piece and all the other news.
[1:39:54.720 --> 1:39:56.720]  Now I'm going to open the phones up for you to comment on this.
[1:39:56.720 --> 1:39:58.720]  But understand, we can laugh at this all day.
[1:39:58.720 --> 1:40:04.720]  My friends and family say, oh, Saturday Night Live has 10% of the viewers it used to.
[1:40:04.720 --> 1:40:05.720]  Why do you care?
[1:40:05.720 --> 1:40:08.720]  Because it's concerted and the globalists are arrogant.
[1:40:08.720 --> 1:40:13.720]  They think like Saturday Night Live is the jewel in their crown of BS.
[1:40:13.720 --> 1:40:18.720]  And so the fact that they have to attack me by name on that, they see this as a huge failure.
[1:40:18.720 --> 1:40:21.720]  But it's because they plan to move on us.
[1:40:21.720 --> 1:40:26.720]  They wouldn't have homeland and all these other shows saying I'm a criminal and like Lex Luthor.
[1:40:26.720 --> 1:40:37.720]  Yes, the new Lex Luthor character is a talk show host on CBS Showtime Garbage Homeland.
[1:40:37.720 --> 1:40:40.720]  That means that they're planning something big, folks.
[1:40:40.720 --> 1:40:43.720]  They wouldn't be doing this unless they had something planned big.
[1:40:43.720 --> 1:40:47.720]  They're going to probably false flag and have some guy say he did it because of me and blow a school up or something.
[1:40:47.720 --> 1:40:49.720]  I mean, that's just how they operate.
[1:40:49.720 --> 1:40:51.720]  That's just how they operate.
[1:40:51.720 --> 1:40:57.720]  I mean, the same people funded the Arab Spring that killed 500,000 people conservatively now, 300,000 in Syria.
[1:40:57.720 --> 1:40:59.720]  These are ruthless people.
[1:40:59.720 --> 1:41:00.720]  And all of it's to demoralize.
[1:41:00.720 --> 1:41:05.720]  You show the military as a bunch of obese women because they're lowering standards to destroy our military.
[1:41:05.720 --> 1:41:06.720]  I don't think it's obese women.
[1:41:06.720 --> 1:41:08.720]  It's just you can't be in combat, OK?
[1:41:08.720 --> 1:41:10.720]  And just all of it's a culture war.
[1:41:10.720 --> 1:41:11.720]  All of it's to make us weak.
[1:41:11.720 --> 1:41:12.720]  All of it's to lower standards.
[1:41:12.720 --> 1:41:14.720]  He just roll over in the ditch.
[1:41:14.720 --> 1:41:17.720]  They got a bunch of angry, weird followers and beta males.
[1:41:17.720 --> 1:41:22.720]  They're going to be part of these big henpecking factories that run the SNL scripting.
[1:41:22.720 --> 1:41:29.720]  They have their token white male come out, Alec Baldwin, to play the part of the evil president and put words in his mouth.
[1:41:29.720 --> 1:41:32.720]  So Zorbalat 9, one of a blaze.
[1:41:32.720 --> 1:41:36.720]  They're like, oh, he's on the payroll of Zorbalat 9 too.
[1:41:36.720 --> 1:41:39.720]  So again, this is the lies they're pushing.
[1:41:39.720 --> 1:41:43.720]  Let's continue with Saturday Night Live from Saturday.
[1:41:43.720 --> 1:41:46.720]  General, the aliens are outside the base.
[1:41:46.720 --> 1:41:47.720]  Yeah, there's so much.
[1:41:47.720 --> 1:41:52.720]  I know they were thinking about Baghdad Bob, the information minister in Iraq in 2003,
[1:41:52.720 --> 1:41:59.720]  when there's fighter bombers bombing three miles behind him in mushroom clouds of 2,000 pound bombs and strafing happenings.
[1:41:59.720 --> 1:42:00.720]  Like, we have these are the Americans.
[1:42:00.720 --> 1:42:02.720]  They are kicked out of the entire country.
[1:42:02.720 --> 1:42:04.720]  We drove them back to Kuwait.
[1:42:04.720 --> 1:42:05.720]  They are defeated.
[1:42:05.720 --> 1:42:06.720]  Remember Baghdad Bob?
[1:42:06.720 --> 1:42:08.720]  He was super entertaining.
[1:42:08.720 --> 1:42:09.720]  It's the same deal.
[1:42:09.720 --> 1:42:15.720]  But again, they claim as the base is under attack, as the president's about to be, you know, attacked by the actual aliens face to face.
[1:42:15.720 --> 1:42:17.720]  Again, it's like Baghdad Bob.
[1:42:17.720 --> 1:42:19.720]  The truth is the globalists are in trouble.
[1:42:19.720 --> 1:42:20.720]  The globalists are in crisis.
[1:42:20.720 --> 1:42:22.720]  The globalists need to watch their butts.
[1:42:22.720 --> 1:42:24.720]  The globalists are failing all over the planet.
[1:42:24.720 --> 1:42:29.720]  And you're the alien global force that is alien to nation states and freedom.
[1:42:29.720 --> 1:42:31.720]  You're the breakaway civilization.
[1:42:31.720 --> 1:42:32.720]  The future doesn't need us.
[1:42:32.720 --> 1:42:33.720]  You're Mark Zuckerberg.
[1:42:33.720 --> 1:42:34.720]  You're Schmidt.
[1:42:34.720 --> 1:42:36.720]  You know, you're Ray Kurzweil.
[1:42:36.720 --> 1:42:37.720]  You're going to live forever.
[1:42:37.720 --> 1:42:38.720]  Life extension.
[1:42:38.720 --> 1:42:40.720]  You're better than us.
[1:42:40.720 --> 1:42:43.720]  We better accept augmentation or be squashed like a bug.
[1:42:43.720 --> 1:42:49.720]  Elon Musk.
[1:42:49.720 --> 1:42:50.720]  Ray Kurzweil.
[1:42:50.720 --> 1:42:51.720]  Give me a break.
[1:42:51.720 --> 1:42:52.720]  Let's go back to it.
[1:42:52.720 --> 1:42:54.720]  Please, we have to do something.
[1:42:54.720 --> 1:42:56.720]  Look how much the aliens control.
[1:42:56.720 --> 1:42:58.720]  This is the aliens.
[1:42:58.720 --> 1:43:01.720]  And this is us.
[1:43:01.720 --> 1:43:03.720]  The president is pausing him.
[1:43:03.720 --> 1:43:04.720]  The president's an idiot.
[1:43:04.720 --> 1:43:05.720]  He says, everything's fine.
[1:43:05.720 --> 1:43:06.720]  The aliens aren't getting us.
[1:43:06.720 --> 1:43:07.720]  He's, of course, wrong.
[1:43:07.720 --> 1:43:08.720]  The whole country's in green.
[1:43:08.720 --> 1:43:09.720]  The aliens.
[1:43:09.720 --> 1:43:10.720]  The tiny areas in red.
[1:43:10.720 --> 1:43:12.720]  Now, they really want to flip that because the whole country's gone red.
[1:43:12.720 --> 1:43:15.720]  The problem is the reds are actually globalists as well.
[1:43:15.720 --> 1:43:16.720]  Paul Ryan.
[1:43:16.720 --> 1:43:18.720]  But the whole country thinks they're changing things going red.
[1:43:18.720 --> 1:43:21.720]  And so the blue is actually only in a few tiny areas.
[1:43:21.720 --> 1:43:23.720]  So again, inversion of reality.
[1:43:23.720 --> 1:43:24.720]  Let's continue.
[1:43:24.720 --> 1:43:25.720]  Yes.
[1:43:25.720 --> 1:43:26.720]  That is a great show.
[1:43:26.720 --> 1:43:27.720]  This is us.
[1:43:27.720 --> 1:43:30.720]  And I can't watch it because it's on NBC.
[1:43:30.720 --> 1:43:32.720]  And NBC has been very unfair to me.
[1:43:32.720 --> 1:43:33.720]  That was product placement.
[1:43:33.720 --> 1:43:35.720]  Sir, I have some terrible news.
[1:43:35.720 --> 1:43:36.720]  New York City has been attacked.
[1:43:36.720 --> 1:43:38.720]  And Trump Hotel has been completely destroyed.
[1:43:38.720 --> 1:43:41.720]  They said, let's work on the product placement to plug our new show.
[1:43:41.720 --> 1:43:43.720]  But also lies.
[1:43:43.720 --> 1:43:47.720]  And the president watches it at a subconscious level of suspended disbelief.
[1:43:47.720 --> 1:43:53.720]  But now since we did our economic money making, the equivalent of millions of dollars are advertising right there.
[1:43:53.720 --> 1:43:55.720]  And they're bloated advertising system.
[1:43:55.720 --> 1:43:58.720]  Now let's do the economic warfare and say nobody's in his Trump towers.
[1:43:58.720 --> 1:44:01.720]  It's been destroyed saying it's not safe subconsciously.
[1:44:01.720 --> 1:44:03.720]  That's near subliminal.
[1:44:03.720 --> 1:44:08.720]  But then publicly, no one wants to stay there like there's roaches in the food, which they've actually tried to say in the news.
[1:44:08.720 --> 1:44:09.720]  All lies.
[1:44:09.720 --> 1:44:11.720]  So again, then they want to economically attack him.
[1:44:11.720 --> 1:44:14.720]  They suck off his energy to say he watches their show.
[1:44:14.720 --> 1:44:15.720]  They plug their show.
[1:44:15.720 --> 1:44:17.720]  Then they go, but now let's attack.
[1:44:17.720 --> 1:44:18.720]  You can see them in their writing.
[1:44:18.720 --> 1:44:19.720]  Let's suck his energy.
[1:44:19.720 --> 1:44:20.720]  The American people's energy.
[1:44:20.720 --> 1:44:21.720]  Let's steal it.
[1:44:21.720 --> 1:44:22.720]  Okay, because we need him.
[1:44:22.720 --> 1:44:23.720]  They don't need us.
[1:44:23.720 --> 1:44:24.720]  Okay, we stole energy.
[1:44:24.720 --> 1:44:26.720]  Now let's try to hurt him financially.
[1:44:26.720 --> 1:44:27.720]  Because we're vampires.
[1:44:27.720 --> 1:44:29.720]  We take and we hurt you.
[1:44:29.720 --> 1:44:31.720]  Continue.
[1:44:31.720 --> 1:44:32.720]  I have some terrible news.
[1:44:32.720 --> 1:44:34.720]  New York City has been attacked.
[1:44:34.720 --> 1:44:38.720]  And Trump Hotel has been completely destroyed, causing 50 million dollars in damage.
[1:44:38.720 --> 1:44:40.720]  More like a billion dollars.
[1:44:40.720 --> 1:44:44.720]  Well, luckily, no lives were lost because no one was staying at the hotel.
[1:44:44.720 --> 1:44:46.720]  They can't help but lie.
[1:44:46.720 --> 1:44:53.720]  Last time I saw, because I saw it broken down the numbers, Trump Tower is worth over a billion dollars.
[1:44:53.720 --> 1:44:56.720]  And the surrounding buildings that has just in New York.
[1:44:56.720 --> 1:44:57.720]  So again, even that's a lie.
[1:44:57.720 --> 1:44:59.720]  They know it's not worth 50.
[1:44:59.720 --> 1:45:03.720]  So they say that and then they have them say more like a billion, which is actually true.
[1:45:03.720 --> 1:45:06.720]  But see, again, it's just all about inverting reality.
[1:45:06.720 --> 1:45:07.720]  They're not creative.
[1:45:07.720 --> 1:45:08.720]  And now they understood.
[1:45:08.720 --> 1:45:10.720]  They don't just invert because they like it.
[1:45:10.720 --> 1:45:12.720]  They can't help it.
[1:45:12.720 --> 1:45:15.720]  They just look at real numbers and then flip them.
[1:45:15.720 --> 1:45:17.720]  Wow, these people, look at them.
[1:45:17.720 --> 1:45:18.720]  They're just jokes.
[1:45:18.720 --> 1:45:24.720]  Let's go back to it.
[1:45:24.720 --> 1:45:25.720]  That's not true.
[1:45:25.720 --> 1:45:27.720]  Everyone loves to stay at my hotel.
[1:45:27.720 --> 1:45:28.720]  Back it up again.
[1:45:28.720 --> 1:45:29.720]  The 20 seconds.
[1:45:29.720 --> 1:45:32.720]  You see, globalists, they call it lesser magic, even though they're not actually into lesser magic.
[1:45:32.720 --> 1:45:33.720]  Most of them.
[1:45:33.720 --> 1:45:34.720]  They can get people to share.
[1:45:34.720 --> 1:45:36.720]  That's a real studio audience.
[1:45:36.720 --> 1:45:43.720]  The fake president saying something true, then they cheer that he's dumb and wrong about it being worth more like a billion than 50 million.
[1:45:43.720 --> 1:45:45.720]  Then they're cheering being lied to.
[1:45:45.720 --> 1:45:48.720]  So that makes the chumping, the pimping even better.
[1:45:48.720 --> 1:45:51.720]  I mean, man, how you pimp so good?
[1:45:51.720 --> 1:45:53.720]  Snoop Dogg has buckled that one.
[1:45:53.720 --> 1:45:54.720]  Man, how you pimp so good?
[1:45:54.720 --> 1:45:56.720]  Little inside baseball snoop.
[1:45:56.720 --> 1:45:58.720]  Man, how you pimp so good?
[1:45:58.720 --> 1:45:59.720]  How you pimp everybody?
[1:45:59.720 --> 1:46:01.720]  Oh, I know all about you, Snoop.
[1:46:01.720 --> 1:46:03.720]  How you pimp so good?
[1:46:03.720 --> 1:46:04.720]  Let's go back to pimping so good.
[1:46:04.720 --> 1:46:05.720]  Here it is.
[1:46:05.720 --> 1:46:07.720]  Sir, I have some terrible news.
[1:46:07.720 --> 1:46:12.720]  New York City has been attacked and Trump Hotel has been completely destroyed, causing 50 million dollars in damage.
[1:46:12.720 --> 1:46:14.720]  More like a billion dollars.
[1:46:14.720 --> 1:46:18.720]  Well, luckily no lives were lost because no one was staying at the hotel.
[1:46:18.720 --> 1:46:19.720]  That's not true.
[1:46:25.720 --> 1:46:26.720]  That's not true.
[1:46:26.720 --> 1:46:28.720]  Everyone loves to stay at my hotel.
[1:46:28.720 --> 1:46:31.720]  I'm sure a bunch of really top shelf, very classy people died there.
[1:46:31.720 --> 1:46:33.720]  Good pause.
[1:46:33.720 --> 1:46:35.720]  Back in five seconds again.
[1:46:35.720 --> 1:46:41.720]  This is all written total subliminal to manipulate the dumbest unconscious masses to say everything he says is dumb.
[1:46:41.720 --> 1:46:46.720]  That's the equivalent of saying, you know, I don't lie and then lightning goes, thunder goes off behind you.
[1:46:46.720 --> 1:46:48.720]  So classy people stay there.
[1:46:48.720 --> 1:46:49.720]  It's very nice.
[1:46:49.720 --> 1:46:51.720]  Well, that's true.
[1:46:51.720 --> 1:46:53.720]  It's one of the best addresses in New York.
[1:46:55.720 --> 1:46:57.720]  20 years ago, probably the best address.
[1:46:57.720 --> 1:47:04.720]  Let's say the top three addresses, that's undisputed, but see, oh, they laser attack right when he says that, just showing he's a total idiot.
[1:47:04.720 --> 1:47:07.720]  And I know you know all this because you're dialed into the show.
[1:47:07.720 --> 1:47:08.720]  Not because I woke you up.
[1:47:08.720 --> 1:47:10.720]  You found the show because you were already thinking and seeking.
[1:47:10.720 --> 1:47:13.720]  Think about the victims that watch this garbage.
[1:47:13.720 --> 1:47:14.720]  Let's go back to it.
[1:47:20.720 --> 1:47:22.720]  I actually heard the aliens are already here.
[1:47:22.720 --> 1:47:24.720]  They've been hiding in this.
[1:47:24.720 --> 1:47:25.720]  Let's back it up.
[1:47:25.720 --> 1:47:27.720]  He's been denying the aliens are coming.
[1:47:27.720 --> 1:47:29.720]  Now he's going to flip it around and say they're here.
[1:47:29.720 --> 1:47:30.720]  Now this is where M4s comes in.
[1:47:30.720 --> 1:47:37.720]  He goes to one black lady and then he goes to another black lady implying he doesn't think black people are humans.
[1:47:37.720 --> 1:47:38.720]  Now that's not Donald Trump folks.
[1:47:38.720 --> 1:47:40.720]  That's that's Alec Baldwin.
[1:47:41.720 --> 1:47:42.720]  Okay.
[1:47:43.720 --> 1:47:44.720]  A dumbass.
[1:47:46.720 --> 1:47:50.720]  And now where he gets me mad because again, yes, it's true.
[1:47:50.720 --> 1:47:54.720]  Trump gets some of his news from M4s, but that doesn't matter.
[1:47:54.720 --> 1:47:55.720]  It's a lot of it from Drudge.
[1:47:55.720 --> 1:47:57.720]  It's just analysis.
[1:47:57.720 --> 1:48:00.720]  Like Drudge puts out the job numbers, 290 something thousand.
[1:48:00.720 --> 1:48:02.720]  It's already admitted it's associated press.
[1:48:02.720 --> 1:48:03.720]  Drudge says great again.
[1:48:03.720 --> 1:48:04.720]  Trump likes that.
[1:48:04.720 --> 1:48:05.720]  It's true.
[1:48:05.720 --> 1:48:06.720]  He puts it out.
[1:48:06.720 --> 1:48:07.720]  Is that fake news?
[1:48:07.720 --> 1:48:08.720]  No, it's totally true.
[1:48:08.720 --> 1:48:09.720]  Totally true.
[1:48:09.720 --> 1:48:11.720]  See, we're not totally true.
[1:48:11.720 --> 1:48:12.720]  We're trying to be totally true.
[1:48:12.720 --> 1:48:14.720]  We work hard to get it right.
[1:48:14.720 --> 1:48:15.720]  It's hard.
[1:48:15.720 --> 1:48:16.720]  We're wrong.
[1:48:16.720 --> 1:48:17.720]  We admit it.
[1:48:17.720 --> 1:48:24.720]  We're wrong.
[1:48:24.720 --> 1:48:26.720]  So here's the big one.
[1:48:26.720 --> 1:48:31.720]  They're claiming Donald Trump doesn't like black people when he got all these NAACP awards.
[1:48:31.720 --> 1:48:36.720]  I mean, this is when he just gained $25 billion.
[1:48:36.720 --> 1:48:43.720]  How many is that 10 times what Obama gave in eight years?
[1:48:43.720 --> 1:48:50.720]  And he got the right wing to cheer the biggest transfer to black colleges ever seen in history.
[1:48:50.720 --> 1:48:51.720]  But does it matter?
[1:48:51.720 --> 1:48:52.720]  They have a fake Donald Trump.
[1:48:52.720 --> 1:48:53.720]  He doesn't like black people.
[1:48:53.720 --> 1:48:54.720]  See how that works?
[1:48:54.720 --> 1:48:57.720]  It's so sick that they just do this out the open.
[1:48:57.720 --> 1:49:00.720]  They're so dirty.
[1:49:00.720 --> 1:49:02.720]  Let's go back to it.
[1:49:02.720 --> 1:49:05.720]  I actually heard the aliens are already here.
[1:49:05.720 --> 1:49:08.720]  They've been hiding in this country for hundreds of years.
[1:49:08.720 --> 1:49:09.720]  It's a fact.
[1:49:09.720 --> 1:49:10.720]  They're shape shifters.
[1:49:10.720 --> 1:49:12.720]  They look like regular people, but they're aliens.
[1:49:12.720 --> 1:49:13.720]  Look, there's one right there.
[1:49:13.720 --> 1:49:16.720]  I see hundreds of years of slavery, black people.
[1:49:16.720 --> 1:49:17.720]  What?
[1:49:17.720 --> 1:49:19.720]  I am not an alien.
[1:49:19.720 --> 1:49:20.720]  Here she is.
[1:49:20.720 --> 1:49:23.720]  And so is the woman next to her right there.
[1:49:23.720 --> 1:49:24.720]  Oh, OK.
[1:49:24.720 --> 1:49:25.720]  No.
[1:49:25.720 --> 1:49:26.720]  Could pause again and back it up.
[1:49:26.720 --> 1:49:28.720]  I want to ask viewers and listeners.
[1:49:28.720 --> 1:49:30.720]  I want to open the phones up for black Americans.
[1:49:30.720 --> 1:49:32.720]  I want to see African Americans, whatever.
[1:49:32.720 --> 1:49:33.720]  They all have a new name.
[1:49:33.720 --> 1:49:36.720]  Just people that happen to be from Africa in your lineage.
[1:49:36.720 --> 1:49:41.720]  Do you think anybody black bought this?
[1:49:41.720 --> 1:49:44.720]  I mean, this is what they do to me and Trump constantly is they
[1:49:44.720 --> 1:49:46.720]  just keep saying, you know, they play this clip.
[1:49:46.720 --> 1:49:51.720]  I do not have anything against gay people.
[1:49:51.720 --> 1:49:53.720]  I'm against gay people.
[1:49:53.720 --> 1:49:54.720]  I love everybody.
[1:49:54.720 --> 1:49:55.720]  I love black people.
[1:49:55.720 --> 1:49:56.720]  I hate black people.
[1:49:56.720 --> 1:49:58.720]  I mean, they just lie.
[1:49:58.720 --> 1:49:59.720]  And watch.
[1:49:59.720 --> 1:50:00.720]  He goes, I learned from Alex.
[1:50:00.720 --> 1:50:02.720]  I learned from Alex Jones.
[1:50:02.720 --> 1:50:05.720]  I mean, just think of how dumb they think all of us are.
[1:50:05.720 --> 1:50:06.720]  I'm going to skip this break.
[1:50:06.720 --> 1:50:07.720]  I just have to.
[1:50:07.720 --> 1:50:09.720]  There may be a show soon of this continues.
[1:50:09.720 --> 1:50:12.720]  This is what they're openly doing to us.
[1:50:12.720 --> 1:50:16.720]  And it's so criminal to try to invoke all this race garbage.
[1:50:16.720 --> 1:50:19.720]  They do it over and over and say, oh, it's just, it's entertainment.
[1:50:19.720 --> 1:50:20.720]  No, it's not funny.
[1:50:20.720 --> 1:50:21.720]  It's all one sided crap.
[1:50:21.720 --> 1:50:22.720]  And they admit it.
[1:50:22.720 --> 1:50:25.720]  SNL was in the WikiLeaks being advised by Hillary.
[1:50:25.720 --> 1:50:26.720]  It's dirty.
[1:50:26.720 --> 1:50:28.720]  It's deceptive.
[1:50:28.720 --> 1:50:33.720]  And Snoop Dogg released a new video today saying kill Trump.
[1:50:33.720 --> 1:50:35.720]  Why are you pimp so good?
[1:50:35.720 --> 1:50:38.720]  How are you pimp so good?
[1:50:38.720 --> 1:50:39.720]  Pimp in your people, man.
[1:50:39.720 --> 1:50:40.720]  It's uncool.
[1:50:40.720 --> 1:50:46.720]  Snoop Dogg tell folks about how hydrofluorosic acid for whatever reason has double the effect
[1:50:46.720 --> 1:50:50.720]  on black people and is even worse than it is for any other group.
[1:50:50.720 --> 1:50:51.720]  For some reason genetically.
[1:50:51.720 --> 1:50:56.720]  Oh, you just too busy acting tough all day and all self-centered like a big ass punk.
[1:50:56.720 --> 1:51:00.720]  Like that Rick Ross jail guard piece of garbage.
[1:51:00.720 --> 1:51:02.720]  I wouldn't want to have any of your mojo, my friend.
[1:51:02.720 --> 1:51:04.720]  You're a loser in a dirt bag.
[1:51:04.720 --> 1:51:06.720]  And so are the Alec Ball and all these other rats.
[1:51:06.720 --> 1:51:08.720]  I'm going to get the homeland attack in a moment.
[1:51:08.720 --> 1:51:14.720]  But let's just continue here right now.
[1:51:14.720 --> 1:51:16.720]  You know, Snoop, anything happens to the president.
[1:51:16.720 --> 1:51:23.720]  I've got a sneaking suspicion that you're not going to be just trying to round up black
[1:51:23.720 --> 1:51:25.720]  kids and white kids and make sure they all go to prison.
[1:51:25.720 --> 1:51:27.720]  You're going to be dealing with a lot more than that, aren't you?
[1:51:27.720 --> 1:51:29.720]  I think you do know that, Mr. Tough Guy.
[1:51:29.720 --> 1:51:32.720]  All right, let's go ahead and go back to this garbage.
[1:51:32.720 --> 1:51:33.720]  Here it is.
[1:51:33.720 --> 1:51:37.720]  Here she is and so is the woman next to her right there.
[1:51:37.720 --> 1:51:41.720]  Oh, okay, no.
[1:51:41.720 --> 1:51:44.720]  Sir, where are you getting this information?
[1:51:44.720 --> 1:51:46.720]  From a very reputable source.
[1:51:46.720 --> 1:51:47.720]  What?
[1:51:47.720 --> 1:51:48.720]  The FBI?
[1:51:48.720 --> 1:51:49.720]  The CIA?
[1:51:49.720 --> 1:51:50.720]  Info wars.
[1:51:50.720 --> 1:51:51.720]  Back it up again.
[1:51:51.720 --> 1:51:54.720]  To the very start when he goes black people are aliens.
[1:51:54.720 --> 1:51:55.720]  They've been there for hundreds of years.
[1:51:55.720 --> 1:51:56.720]  Total evil.
[1:51:56.720 --> 1:51:57.720]  Total race betting.
[1:51:57.720 --> 1:51:58.720]  Trump never said any of that.
[1:51:58.720 --> 1:51:59.720]  Total trash.
[1:51:59.720 --> 1:52:03.720]  What was it of reality?
[1:52:03.720 --> 1:52:07.720]  And then, info wars, a very reputable source.
[1:52:07.720 --> 1:52:09.720]  Now saying he got it from me.
[1:52:09.720 --> 1:52:11.720]  And I know our listeners get this.
[1:52:11.720 --> 1:52:14.720]  I'm talking to new viewers, people that are, you know, actually watching.
[1:52:14.720 --> 1:52:19.720]  I want them to see how they're being manipulated millisecond by millisecond by millisecond.
[1:52:19.720 --> 1:52:20.720]  Continue.
[1:52:20.720 --> 1:52:22.720]  They look like regular people, but they're aliens.
[1:52:22.720 --> 1:52:26.720]  Look, there's one right there.
[1:52:26.720 --> 1:52:29.720]  I am not an alien.
[1:52:29.720 --> 1:52:30.720]  Here she is.
[1:52:30.720 --> 1:52:33.720]  And so is the woman next to her right there.
[1:52:33.720 --> 1:52:34.720]  Oh, okay.
[1:52:34.720 --> 1:52:35.720]  No.
[1:52:35.720 --> 1:52:40.720]  Sir, where are you getting this information?
[1:52:40.720 --> 1:52:42.720]  From a very reputable source.
[1:52:42.720 --> 1:52:43.720]  What?
[1:52:43.720 --> 1:52:44.720]  The FBI?
[1:52:44.720 --> 1:52:45.720]  The CIA?
[1:52:45.720 --> 1:52:46.720]  Info wars.
[1:52:46.720 --> 1:52:47.720]  Back in five seconds.
[1:52:47.720 --> 1:52:49.720]  You have to go every 10 seconds to the lies.
[1:52:49.720 --> 1:52:50.720]  A reputable source.
[1:52:50.720 --> 1:52:54.720]  FBI CIA with all the crap they've been caught lying about with the WikiLeaks coming out.
[1:52:54.720 --> 1:52:59.720]  With 9,000 pages of how they're watching and listening and manipulating the media and framing Russia.
[1:52:59.720 --> 1:53:03.720]  It's in the WikiLeaks that they frame Russia with cyber attacks on America.
[1:53:03.720 --> 1:53:07.720]  Russia can barely keep its lights on.
[1:53:07.720 --> 1:53:10.720]  Russia's been encircled by NATO, starting wars with them.
[1:53:10.720 --> 1:53:13.720]  If Russia was all big and powerful like China in our face, screw Russia.
[1:53:13.720 --> 1:53:14.720]  I never even been to Russia.
[1:53:14.720 --> 1:53:17.720]  The point is, is that Russia's fighting the globalists.
[1:53:17.720 --> 1:53:20.720]  So again, oh, the FBI, the CIA, is that the reputable source?
[1:53:20.720 --> 1:53:22.720]  No, it's info wars.
[1:53:22.720 --> 1:53:23.720]  They're the ones.
[1:53:23.720 --> 1:53:25.720]  Let me tell you something, SNL.
[1:53:25.720 --> 1:53:27.720]  Dumb people watch your show.
[1:53:27.720 --> 1:53:28.720]  Idiots.
[1:53:28.720 --> 1:53:29.720]  The demographics.
[1:53:29.720 --> 1:53:30.720]  Either very old or very poor watching.
[1:53:30.720 --> 1:53:31.720]  People can look it up.
[1:53:31.720 --> 1:53:33.720]  That's what watches broadcast TV.
[1:53:33.720 --> 1:53:36.720]  Let me explain something to you very, very slowly.
[1:53:36.720 --> 1:53:38.720]  There's factions in the government.
[1:53:38.720 --> 1:53:40.720]  I've never been part of one of those factions.
[1:53:40.720 --> 1:53:41.720]  Okay?
[1:53:41.720 --> 1:53:44.720]  But I did grow up around people that had been in those factions.
[1:53:44.720 --> 1:53:45.720]  The good faction.
[1:53:45.720 --> 1:53:49.720]  And just let me explain something to you very, very slowly.
[1:53:49.720 --> 1:53:51.720]  The patriots in the government for at least 15 years.
[1:53:51.720 --> 1:53:53.720]  Actually, I got reports this before that.
[1:53:53.720 --> 1:53:57.720]  We're ordered to listen to my show and what we broadcast here because it's on target.
[1:53:57.720 --> 1:53:58.720]  Okay?
[1:53:58.720 --> 1:54:00.720]  So make your jokes all day.
[1:54:00.720 --> 1:54:03.720]  Info wars is as reputable as it gets.
[1:54:03.720 --> 1:54:07.720]  It's come out in foreign hacks of the Russian government, the Japanese government,
[1:54:07.720 --> 1:54:09.720]  the Syrian government, the Israeli government.
[1:54:09.720 --> 1:54:11.720]  In the London independent, you name it,
[1:54:11.720 --> 1:54:13.720]  that when they hack into people's emails and they get released,
[1:54:13.720 --> 1:54:16.720]  it's heads of state saying, listen to Alex Jones.
[1:54:16.720 --> 1:54:17.720]  Watch this video.
[1:54:17.720 --> 1:54:18.720]  This is what's happening.
[1:54:18.720 --> 1:54:21.720]  And why do they do that? Because I understand what's going on.
[1:54:21.720 --> 1:54:24.720]  And I can look into things and have a background in history as an analyst.
[1:54:24.720 --> 1:54:28.720]  I'm a private analyst when I am.
[1:54:28.720 --> 1:54:33.720]  And I am able to 99 times out of 100 break down what's really happening
[1:54:33.720 --> 1:54:37.720]  by looking at all the information that looks like a bunch of spaghetti to other people.
[1:54:37.720 --> 1:54:41.720]  Looks like a bunch of, you know, Rorschach blots.
[1:54:41.720 --> 1:54:46.720]  And I'm able to break down the basic essence of what's happening in the different factions
[1:54:46.720 --> 1:54:50.720]  from my study and then the world leaders aren't able to give their underlings
[1:54:50.720 --> 1:54:52.720]  classified info or other information.
[1:54:52.720 --> 1:54:54.720]  They just say, watch this, he has it.
[1:54:54.720 --> 1:54:58.720]  The Japan, I mean, I remember one time I had the Japanese vice president on.
[1:54:58.720 --> 1:54:59.720]  I knew he was the head of the diet.
[1:54:59.720 --> 1:55:00.720]  I didn't know he was the vice president.
[1:55:00.720 --> 1:55:01.720]  He wanted to come on.
[1:55:01.720 --> 1:55:02.720]  And I wasn't even like, you're great.
[1:55:02.720 --> 1:55:03.720]  You're excellent.
[1:55:03.720 --> 1:55:04.720]  See all this crap.
[1:55:04.720 --> 1:55:07.720]  And they were like in the, in the diet, like showing my information on 9-11.
[1:55:07.720 --> 1:55:08.720]  And I'm up bragging.
[1:55:08.720 --> 1:55:12.720]  It's just that these guys sit here and make these jokes how we're not credible.
[1:55:12.720 --> 1:55:13.720]  You're not credible.
[1:55:13.720 --> 1:55:14.720]  You're a joke.
[1:55:14.720 --> 1:55:15.720]  We're changing the world.
[1:55:15.720 --> 1:55:19.720]  We just got a populist anti-new world order president and globalism is being exposed.
[1:55:19.720 --> 1:55:20.720]  Political correctness.
[1:55:20.720 --> 1:55:21.720]  World government.
[1:55:21.720 --> 1:55:22.720]  TPP is gone.
[1:55:22.720 --> 1:55:23.720]  10 years of the making.
[1:55:23.720 --> 1:55:25.720]  Blown up.
[1:55:25.720 --> 1:55:28.720]  And you want to sit there and make the joke that we're not credible.
[1:55:28.720 --> 1:55:33.720]  We're wrecking your whole system and your trillions of dollars against us.
[1:55:33.720 --> 1:55:37.720]  And Trump just wrecked you.
[1:55:37.720 --> 1:55:42.720]  So again, in version of reality, we are credible.
[1:55:42.720 --> 1:55:43.720]  You're not credible.
[1:55:43.720 --> 1:55:47.720]  You have to pose and manipulate your dumb viewers posing as comics when you're really
[1:55:47.720 --> 1:55:51.720]  spewing this info back to it.
[1:55:51.720 --> 1:55:54.720]  Sir, where are you getting this information?
[1:55:54.720 --> 1:55:56.720]  From a very reputable source.
[1:55:56.720 --> 1:55:57.720]  What?
[1:55:57.720 --> 1:55:58.720]  The FBI?
[1:55:58.720 --> 1:55:59.720]  The CIA?
[1:55:59.720 --> 1:56:00.720]  Infowars.
[1:56:00.720 --> 1:56:02.720]  It's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones.
[1:56:02.720 --> 1:56:05.720]  You know he's legit because he's always taking off his shirt.
[1:56:05.720 --> 1:56:06.720]  Okay.
[1:56:06.720 --> 1:56:09.720]  That is why I hair by demand.
[1:56:09.720 --> 1:56:10.720]  Sorry.
[1:56:10.720 --> 1:56:11.720]  I hear be bedan.
[1:56:11.720 --> 1:56:12.720]  Sorry.
[1:56:12.720 --> 1:56:14.720]  He can't even do an executive order.
[1:56:14.720 --> 1:56:16.720]  You know, Trump's been excellent executive orders.
[1:56:16.720 --> 1:56:18.720]  Incredible action in the first 50 plus days.
[1:56:18.720 --> 1:56:19.720]  Everybody's had to admit that.
[1:56:19.720 --> 1:56:20.720]  Economy exploding.
[1:56:20.720 --> 1:56:22.720]  Now he's a blibbering idiot, which again is the opposite.
[1:56:22.720 --> 1:56:24.720]  He hardly ever screws up when he gives speeches.
[1:56:24.720 --> 1:56:26.720]  No one knows how he does it without teleprompters.
[1:56:26.720 --> 1:56:27.720]  They're completely amazed.
[1:56:27.720 --> 1:56:30.720]  The state of the union or Congress last week was incredible.
[1:56:30.720 --> 1:56:32.720]  So again, they invert reality.
[1:56:32.720 --> 1:56:33.720]  Another lie.
[1:56:33.720 --> 1:56:34.720]  Here we go.
[1:56:34.720 --> 1:56:42.720]  We launched a full investigation into these two aliens right now.
[1:56:42.720 --> 1:56:45.720]  They're inside the base.
[1:56:45.720 --> 1:56:46.720]  All right, truth.
[1:56:46.720 --> 1:56:51.720]  The time has come to fight as brothers, as sisters, as Americans.
[1:56:51.720 --> 1:56:56.720]  The left's all dividing everybody, creating racial division, hundreds of films and movies
[1:56:56.720 --> 1:57:00.720]  doing it, pushing race, rioting, all this kill the cops garbage.
[1:57:00.720 --> 1:57:04.720]  But now, oh, they're about unity, though, but Trump isn't, he's a coward.
[1:57:04.720 --> 1:57:05.720]  Here's the next big lie.
[1:57:05.720 --> 1:57:06.720]  Go ahead.
[1:57:06.720 --> 1:57:08.720]  Join me in the pledge of allegiance.
[1:57:08.720 --> 1:57:09.720]  He doesn't know it.
[1:57:09.720 --> 1:57:13.720]  I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America.
[1:57:13.720 --> 1:57:16.720]  And then Trump messes up when it's Hillary that took out under God.
[1:57:16.720 --> 1:57:18.720]  And Obama wouldn't put the hand over.
[1:57:18.720 --> 1:57:19.720]  Another lie.
[1:57:19.720 --> 1:57:20.720]  Under God.
[1:57:20.720 --> 1:57:21.720]  Indivisible.
[1:57:21.720 --> 1:57:26.720]  And by liberty and justice for all.
[1:57:26.720 --> 1:57:27.720]  Humans.
[1:57:27.720 --> 1:57:29.720]  Resistance is futile.
[1:57:29.720 --> 1:57:32.720]  Take me to your leader.
[1:57:32.720 --> 1:57:35.720]  It's him.
[1:57:35.720 --> 1:57:36.720]  He's the president.
[1:57:36.720 --> 1:57:37.720]  No, I'm not.
[1:57:37.720 --> 1:57:38.720]  You are.
[1:57:38.720 --> 1:57:39.720]  Really?
[1:57:39.720 --> 1:57:41.720]  This is going to be so easy.
[1:57:41.720 --> 1:57:44.720]  And life from New York is solid.
[1:57:44.720 --> 1:57:46.720]  And all those beta males.
[1:57:46.720 --> 1:57:48.720]  Now the bulletin thinks he's a tough guy.
[1:57:48.720 --> 1:57:54.720]  I challenge him a million dollars to charity he wants to get in the ring with me.
[1:57:54.720 --> 1:57:55.720]  Bare knuckle.
[1:57:55.720 --> 1:57:56.720]  I will.
[1:57:56.720 --> 1:57:57.720]  I'll do it right now.
[1:57:57.720 --> 1:57:59.720]  I'll get in the ring with you and I will break your jaw.
[1:57:59.720 --> 1:58:00.720]  I will knock your teeth out.
[1:58:00.720 --> 1:58:03.720]  I will break your nose and I will break your neck.
[1:58:03.720 --> 1:58:04.720]  You coward.
[1:58:04.720 --> 1:58:06.720]  You think you're a tough guy messing with little cameramen people.
[1:58:06.720 --> 1:58:08.720]  You want to sit there and defame me and the president.
[1:58:08.720 --> 1:58:09.720]  Get in the ring with me.
[1:58:09.720 --> 1:58:11.720]  I will break your jaw in seconds.
[1:58:11.720 --> 1:58:14.720]  I will smash your nose into a bloody pulp.
[1:58:14.720 --> 1:58:16.720]  And I will rack your teeth out.
[1:58:16.720 --> 1:58:19.720]  My fists are going to be bleeding with your teeth marks all over them.
[1:58:19.720 --> 1:58:21.720]  You freaking bully.
[1:58:21.720 --> 1:58:23.720]  You coward.
[1:58:23.720 --> 1:58:24.720]  I hate you.
[1:58:24.720 --> 1:58:25.720]  My listeners hate you.
[1:58:25.720 --> 1:58:28.720]  And remember that scumbag forever.
[1:58:31.720 --> 1:58:33.720]  We're going to defeat this anti-human scum.
[1:58:33.720 --> 1:58:35.720]  We're going to wreck their world.
[1:58:35.720 --> 1:58:58.720]  When I come back, we'll look at the coward at homeland.
[1:58:58.720 --> 1:59:18.720]  We'll never be the same.
[1:59:18.720 --> 1:59:22.220]  trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[1:59:22.220 --> 1:59:25.020]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity,
[1:59:25.020 --> 1:59:29.220]  allowing you to create your own private power grid, literally anywhere in the world.
[1:59:29.220 --> 1:59:34.020]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, any time you need to get off the grid for a while.
[1:59:34.020 --> 1:59:37.420]  Go to privatepowergrid.com to watch this thing in action.

[1:59:47.620 --> 1:59:49.620]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[2:00:17.620 --> 2:00:20.120]  Move it on over, move it on over.
[2:00:48.120 --> 2:00:50.120]  I'm just getting sick of these people.
[2:00:50.120 --> 2:00:52.120]  I really am starting to get tired of them.
[2:00:55.120 --> 2:00:57.120]  Because I watched that five-minute clip.
[2:00:57.120 --> 2:01:00.120]  It took me 30 minutes to start and stop it.
[2:01:00.120 --> 2:01:02.120]  I was eating jalapenos during the break.
[2:01:04.120 --> 2:01:09.620]  And I'm sitting there, watching this crap, meant to create destruction of our society.
[2:01:09.620 --> 2:01:17.620]  And I'm not mad at Baldwin and his cowardly riders because they're even attacking me.
[2:01:17.620 --> 2:01:20.620]  I'm sick of the world they're making for our kids.
[2:01:20.620 --> 2:01:27.120]  The guy is a selfish pig, but he's nothing compared to the guy I'm going to cover in the next segment.
[2:01:27.120 --> 2:01:29.120]  And that's Jake Webber.
[2:01:29.120 --> 2:01:31.120]  And I want to challenge Jake Webber as well.
[2:01:31.120 --> 2:01:37.620]  He can show up in a ring with me, bare knuckles, and he can even do his fake Texas accent.
[2:01:37.620 --> 2:01:42.120]  While he has each episode, I'm helping terrorists kill people.
[2:01:42.120 --> 2:01:44.120]  I'm blaming innocent people for the terror.
[2:01:44.120 --> 2:01:48.120]  I'm setting up war heroes and saying they aren't war heroes.
[2:01:48.120 --> 2:01:49.120]  I mean, you know what?
[2:01:49.120 --> 2:01:52.120]  And they admit in the news it's Alex Jones.
[2:01:52.120 --> 2:01:54.120]  This is uncool, man.
[2:01:54.120 --> 2:01:56.120]  Anybody anywhere in the world.
[2:01:56.120 --> 2:02:00.120]  If he did this to Andrew Jackson 200 years ago, he'd call you out the street, man.
[2:02:00.120 --> 2:02:08.120]  I mean, dude, I don't sit there and say that you hate black people.
[2:02:08.120 --> 2:02:10.120]  I mean, what the hell, man?
[2:02:10.120 --> 2:02:15.120]  Just because you've dehumanized me and want to go on the news and lie about me or create some fictional character
[2:02:15.120 --> 2:02:19.120]  who you say is Alex Jones, you just can't get away with that, bro.
[2:02:19.120 --> 2:02:23.120]  So I'm not going to attack anybody unless they legally get in the ring with me.
[2:02:23.120 --> 2:02:26.120]  And I guess bare knuckles boxing is illegal.
[2:02:26.120 --> 2:02:30.120]  So the point is, I guarantee you, I just am tired of these people, man.
[2:02:30.120 --> 2:02:34.120]  I'm tired of you writing checks you can't cash, bro.
[2:02:34.120 --> 2:02:36.120]  I hope one of you actually takes me up on this.
[2:02:36.120 --> 2:02:39.120]  Because Alex Baldwin is supposedly a tough guy, Irish, I'm sure he is.
[2:02:39.120 --> 2:02:41.120]  I'll take him and Bill O'Reilly on this.
[2:02:41.120 --> 2:02:43.120]  They're both older than me at the same time in the ring.
[2:02:43.120 --> 2:02:46.120]  Bill O'Reilly says, tonight we look at sexual predators.
[2:02:46.120 --> 2:02:49.120]  He cuts to a clip of me screaming about police corruption.
[2:02:49.120 --> 2:02:52.120]  Oh, I've bashed the cops when they're being bad.
[2:02:52.120 --> 2:02:55.120]  And he cuts it into thinking about women being raped.
[2:02:55.120 --> 2:02:58.120]  I mean, dude, dude, dude, I'm so pissed at you.
[2:02:58.120 --> 2:03:00.120]  That's why I'd kick your ass.
[2:03:00.120 --> 2:03:01.120]  I'm pissed off.
[2:03:01.120 --> 2:03:03.120]  You understand that?
[2:03:03.120 --> 2:03:06.120]  I know that I want to punch you in the nose, you understand?
[2:03:06.120 --> 2:03:08.120]  And when I want to punch you in the nose, I don't ever lose.
[2:03:08.120 --> 2:03:11.120]  I love everybody until they lie about me and my family.
[2:03:11.120 --> 2:03:14.120]  And so what am I supposed to do when you say I'm a sex predator?
[2:03:14.120 --> 2:03:16.120]  This guy says I'm a damn racist.
[2:03:16.120 --> 2:03:18.120]  I'm tired of it, man.
[2:03:18.120 --> 2:03:19.120]  You understand?
[2:03:19.120 --> 2:03:22.120]  I'm a person, dumbass.
[2:03:22.120 --> 2:03:25.120]  I don't sit there and say stuff about you that isn't true.
[2:03:25.120 --> 2:03:28.120]  I don't say Alec Baldwin's a child molester.
[2:03:28.120 --> 2:03:33.120]  I don't say that Jake Weber's a child molester.
[2:03:33.120 --> 2:03:36.120]  I don't say you're working with Muslim terrorists.
[2:03:36.120 --> 2:03:40.120]  It's not funny.
[2:03:40.120 --> 2:03:42.120]  But I know it's how much you hate the American people.
[2:03:42.120 --> 2:03:43.120]  That's who you really hate.
[2:03:43.120 --> 2:03:46.120]  You hate the liberty movement and you hate that we're kicking your ass politically.
[2:03:46.120 --> 2:03:48.120]  And just like we're kicking your ass politically,
[2:03:48.120 --> 2:03:51.120]  we're just going to sit back and let you try to start your race where we're going to take it.
[2:03:51.120 --> 2:03:57.120]  I'm going to put all my energy, all my aggressive war-like energy into politically annihilating you.
[2:03:57.120 --> 2:04:02.120]  And I pray to God on the altar of Jesus Christ and the Father and the Holy Spirit to give me the strength
[2:04:02.120 --> 2:04:04.120]  and just continue to have the hedge of protection of the province.
[2:04:04.120 --> 2:04:07.120]  I know it's how I don't deserve this providence, but God knows I mean what I'm doing to just God.
[2:04:07.120 --> 2:04:13.120]  Please, please, please, please open everybody's eyes and raise up other leaders to defeat these people.
[2:04:13.120 --> 2:04:17.120]  Because I just want to see this scum defeated.
[2:04:17.120 --> 2:04:18.120]  They hate us so much.
[2:04:18.120 --> 2:04:23.120]  They are sickening filth. God, they're the most dishonorable monsters the world's ever seen.
[2:04:23.120 --> 2:04:25.120]  They want to start wars with Russia.
[2:04:25.120 --> 2:04:28.120]  They want to start wars everywhere with anybody that isn't a threat.
[2:04:28.120 --> 2:04:32.120]  And then they worship all the real threats like Communist China.
[2:04:32.120 --> 2:04:34.120]  They're funded by them.
[2:04:34.120 --> 2:04:37.120]  Hell, I've read with CBS, got a bunch of Chica money.
[2:04:37.120 --> 2:04:41.120]  I haven't even looked. I bet this show's funded by them.
[2:04:41.120 --> 2:04:45.120]  Look at that little self-serving know-it-all narcissist piece of trash.
[2:04:45.120 --> 2:04:48.120]  Just thank God. I don't want all that crap.
[2:04:48.120 --> 2:04:49.120]  Thank God I'm not with these people.
[2:04:49.120 --> 2:04:51.120]  And thank God they're falling.
[2:04:51.120 --> 2:04:52.120]  Thank God they're failing.
[2:04:52.120 --> 2:04:55.120]  And thank God humanity's rising.
[2:04:55.120 --> 2:04:58.120]  We'll be back with this piece of filth's peace.
[2:05:01.120 --> 2:05:04.120]  Well, folks, America is now offensive in America.
[2:05:04.120 --> 2:05:07.120]  At a high school basketball game in Des Moines, Iowa,
[2:05:07.120 --> 2:05:12.120]  the students from Valley High decided to have a USA-themed crowd and war red, white, and blue.
[2:05:12.120 --> 2:05:15.120]  Despite winning the game, they lost in social justice
[2:05:15.120 --> 2:05:19.120]  as coaches and fans of the other team were offended by the patriotic attire.
[2:05:19.120 --> 2:05:22.120]  See, Des Moines North is said to have 66% minority enrollment,
[2:05:22.120 --> 2:05:24.120]  compared to the 26% at Valley.
[2:05:24.120 --> 2:05:28.120]  As if saying one school as a majority minority isn't crazy enough,
[2:05:28.120 --> 2:05:32.120]  now they're saying it's offensive to wear red, white, and blue if you play against this school.
[2:05:32.120 --> 2:05:35.120]  The biggest issue was that there was a refugee on the North roster,
[2:05:35.120 --> 2:05:38.120]  but you'd think he would embrace the country that embraced him.
[2:05:38.120 --> 2:05:43.120]  This is a trend as last year, Ramapo College vetoed an American-themed barbecue
[2:05:43.120 --> 2:05:46.120]  hosted by college Republicans and college Democrats.
[2:05:46.120 --> 2:05:50.120]  So we can't even come together in patriotism under these liberals.
[2:05:50.120 --> 2:05:52.120]  What is wrong with these people?
[2:05:52.120 --> 2:05:54.120]  Next, they're going to want to remove the flag.
[2:05:54.120 --> 2:06:09.120]  This is Owen Schreuer for Infowars.com, proud to be an American.
[2:06:25.120 --> 2:06:27.120]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[2:06:27.120 --> 2:06:29.120]  They lost. We won.
[2:06:29.120 --> 2:06:31.120]  Want to see what Trump's up against?
[2:06:31.120 --> 2:06:34.120]  It's time to ride, boss. We need a thousand Paul Revere's.
[2:06:34.120 --> 2:06:40.120]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom, and apple pie.
[2:06:40.120 --> 2:06:42.120]  And beef was for supper.

[2:08:27.120 --> 2:08:32.120]  Talk about walking on the fighting side of me, Baldwin, and your riders.
[2:08:32.120 --> 2:08:39.120]  Now, I was told about this months ago by people inside the production of the CBS-funded TV show
[2:08:39.120 --> 2:08:42.120]  that's on Showtime and that's also syndicated to television.
[2:08:42.120 --> 2:08:47.120]  Jake Weber, the whatever fifth, sixth season, whatever it is,
[2:08:47.120 --> 2:08:54.120]  of this ridiculous program, Homeland,
[2:08:54.120 --> 2:08:57.120]  where before it was radical Islamic terrorists, but you can't have that now,
[2:08:57.120 --> 2:08:59.120]  and there's a woman president in the future,
[2:08:59.120 --> 2:09:02.120]  and they had all scripted for Hillary to be in,
[2:09:02.120 --> 2:09:07.120]  and the evil Alex Jones character who they admit in the news is an Alex Jones person
[2:09:07.120 --> 2:09:10.120]  who says everything I say, like, we are the resistance, you want to fight,
[2:09:10.120 --> 2:09:13.120]  you got one, we're going to defeat the globalists who have taken over.
[2:09:13.120 --> 2:09:15.120]  They want you to hear all that and they add to it.
[2:09:15.120 --> 2:09:17.120]  I don't like black people. I didn't say that. That's what they say.
[2:09:17.120 --> 2:09:22.120]  Or, you know, framing people for Islamic terror attacks that they didn't do.
[2:09:22.120 --> 2:09:27.120]  Or, the president's son is out in combat and runs towards this thing to help people,
[2:09:27.120 --> 2:09:33.120]  but I, the Alex Jones character, edited it to say he was running away from battle.
[2:09:33.120 --> 2:09:39.120]  That way people watch this and they hate me.
[2:09:39.120 --> 2:09:42.120]  And this is what they admit they're doing.
[2:09:42.120 --> 2:09:45.120]  And if you're a new listener, there's another tactic where they then say on the news,
[2:09:45.120 --> 2:09:47.120]  Alex thinks Homeland's about him. He's crazy.
[2:09:47.120 --> 2:09:52.120]  Alex thinks CBS, NBC, CNN, 60 Minutes talk about him all the time.
[2:09:52.120 --> 2:09:53.120]  Nightline they do.
[2:09:53.120 --> 2:09:56.120]  Or, Alex thinks that Saturday Night Live talked about him.
[2:09:56.120 --> 2:09:59.120]  They'll actually say that, probably.
[2:09:59.120 --> 2:10:02.120]  I haven't heard it yet, because they, again, it's all about psychological warfare.
[2:10:02.120 --> 2:10:07.120]  They'll do what they're doing, say your name, or admit in newspaper interviews that it's supposed to be you,
[2:10:07.120 --> 2:10:12.120]  but then they'll say, oh, but it isn't that Alex Jones.
[2:10:12.120 --> 2:10:13.120]  Again, they had a movie that came out.
[2:10:13.120 --> 2:10:17.120]  I asked you earlier, what was the name of it? The guy that did Mr. Show and all that.
[2:10:17.120 --> 2:10:22.120]  And he put a movie out a couple years ago.
[2:10:22.120 --> 2:10:27.120]  Yeah, David Cross, where the Alex Jones characters is a racist and he got it all from Alex Jones.
[2:10:27.120 --> 2:10:29.120]  He says, I got it from Alex Jones.
[2:10:29.120 --> 2:10:31.120]  So, this isn't about Alex Jones.
[2:10:31.120 --> 2:10:34.120]  This is about attacking the free press and people that are telling the truth,
[2:10:34.120 --> 2:10:40.120]  and setting the precedent with our broadcast to start restricting it and curtailing it.
[2:10:40.120 --> 2:10:43.120]  The other movie was called Hits, which was not a hit. It was a huge failure, of course.
[2:10:43.120 --> 2:10:48.120]  People are sick of all your weird cult liberal brainwashing of lies.
[2:10:48.120 --> 2:10:52.120]  So, meanwhile, prove Facebook is blocking links to infowars.com.
[2:10:52.120 --> 2:10:54.120]  That's up on infowars.com.
[2:10:54.120 --> 2:10:59.120]  Google, another step closer to being unblocked in China, thanks to U.S. censorship.
[2:10:59.120 --> 2:11:04.120]  Homeland blames Alex Jones' character for fake news.
[2:11:04.120 --> 2:11:10.120]  The March 12th episode that aired last night, we once again see Alex Jones' parody, Brian O'Keefe.
[2:11:10.120 --> 2:11:13.120]  It's going after James O'Keefe. Everything's just like warfare.
[2:11:13.120 --> 2:11:16.120]  Hosts' infowars call show discussing on the military.
[2:11:16.120 --> 2:11:22.120]  Son of President-elect Elizabeth Cain, Vice President Cain, so they had it all lined up,
[2:11:22.120 --> 2:11:28.120]  with footage allegedly services of the son of the president fleeing an active battle scene for his death.
[2:11:28.120 --> 2:11:34.120]  O'Keefe was quick to use it, try to take down who he calls the most dangerous person to ever step foot in the winehouse,
[2:11:34.120 --> 2:11:36.120]  except the footage is edited as fake.
[2:11:36.120 --> 2:11:42.120]  So, see, well, at least this is better than saying I'm blaming people for terrorism that didn't do it.
[2:11:42.120 --> 2:11:45.120]  And they designed the studio. It looked like one of my old studios.
[2:11:45.120 --> 2:11:48.120]  There's even our old logo of the tower and the antenna.
[2:11:48.120 --> 2:11:51.120]  And, of course, they admit this.
[2:11:51.120 --> 2:11:54.120]  So, this is what they're trying to do. This is how they're trying to indoctrinate people.
[2:11:54.120 --> 2:11:58.120]  And I know you know this. So, we'll play it, finish shopping, then get to the other news, open the phones up,
[2:11:58.120 --> 2:12:04.120]  and take your phone calls. And Dr. Corsi's popping in for like 10 minutes with some big breaking news on new crimes Obama's been exposed for.
[2:12:04.120 --> 2:12:06.120]  But let's go ahead and go to this the latest homeland.
[2:12:09.120 --> 2:12:11.120]  Where on earth did you get this?
[2:12:11.120 --> 2:12:13.120]  Well, this was the YouTube war.
[2:12:13.120 --> 2:12:17.120]  Remember, this kid really had a cam on his helmet.
[2:12:17.120 --> 2:12:26.120]  He called the whole goddamn thing.
[2:12:26.120 --> 2:12:28.120]  You're a radio listener.
[2:12:28.120 --> 2:12:32.120]  This is video of the Firefighters out of the building.
[2:12:32.120 --> 2:12:35.120]  This is where it gets good.
[2:12:35.120 --> 2:12:38.120]  This is where it gets good.
[2:12:38.120 --> 2:12:42.120]  Meet Andrew Keen, the only son of President-elect.
[2:12:42.120 --> 2:12:47.120]  Meet Andrew Keen, the only son of President-elect.
[2:12:47.120 --> 2:12:50.120]  They always do kind of an Alabama accent.
[2:12:50.120 --> 2:12:52.120]  The British do. They don't do a Texas accent.
[2:12:52.120 --> 2:12:55.120]  And I talk real fast compared to most Texans.
[2:12:55.120 --> 2:12:59.120]  It's almost like a New York slash Texas accent. People always say, where are you from, Texas?
[2:12:59.120 --> 2:13:02.120]  Well, if I'm not on air fighting the New World Order, I talk slow.
[2:13:02.120 --> 2:13:04.120]  But I'm up here. I'm pissed off.
[2:13:04.120 --> 2:13:11.120]  So, let's go back to the fake actor doing a fake Texan of a fake Alex Jones with a fake video
[2:13:11.120 --> 2:13:14.120]  about a fake thing that never happened that they say I put out that was fake.
[2:13:30.120 --> 2:13:32.120]  And they shoot it all video game style, no one kids watch this.
[2:13:32.120 --> 2:13:42.120]  It's not how it really looks.
[2:14:02.120 --> 2:14:21.120]  But he did three tools, right? He must have taken some risks.
[2:14:21.120 --> 2:14:25.120]  We'd gone to search a warehouse in Sotter City.
[2:14:25.120 --> 2:14:27.120]  We hadn't tell it was a bomb factory.
[2:14:27.120 --> 2:14:34.120]  We had just gotten out of the vehicles when we got hit.
[2:14:34.120 --> 2:14:36.120]  What happened?
[2:14:36.120 --> 2:14:38.120]  We were pinned down, taking fire.
[2:14:38.120 --> 2:14:43.120]  RPGs, sniper guns.
[2:14:43.120 --> 2:14:45.120]  So, we returned fire.
[2:14:45.120 --> 2:14:47.120]  Captain King, what did he do?
[2:14:47.120 --> 2:14:48.120]  There was a lot of noise.
[2:14:48.120 --> 2:14:50.120]  He was there, right? You saw him.
[2:14:50.120 --> 2:14:51.120]  Yes, sir.
[2:14:51.120 --> 2:14:54.120]  So, what was he doing?
[2:14:54.120 --> 2:14:57.120]  He ran past me. He was shouting.
[2:14:57.120 --> 2:14:59.120]  He ran past you?
[2:14:59.120 --> 2:15:05.120]  You mean, he was running away?
[2:15:05.120 --> 2:15:08.120]  He was running, that's for sure.
[2:15:08.120 --> 2:15:10.120]  Does it sound like a hero to me?
[2:15:10.120 --> 2:15:14.120]  No, sir.
[2:15:14.120 --> 2:15:22.120]  He's the opposite of a hero.
[2:15:22.120 --> 2:15:26.120]  Then we wrap it all up with something like...
[2:15:26.120 --> 2:15:28.120]  cowardice.
[2:15:28.120 --> 2:15:32.120]  That runs in the family.
[2:15:32.120 --> 2:15:39.120]  Like I said, it's rough, but I'm betting it'll put an end to her cold-star mom routine.
[2:15:39.120 --> 2:15:41.120]  Is this the only copy of the footage?
[2:15:41.120 --> 2:15:45.120]  Yeah.
[2:15:45.120 --> 2:15:48.120]  Good.
[2:15:48.120 --> 2:15:51.120]  Run it again, will you?
[2:15:51.120 --> 2:15:55.120]  I don't know the truth.
[2:15:55.120 --> 2:15:57.120]  Now, let's break that down.
[2:15:57.120 --> 2:16:05.120]  They're a fake fiction show, admittedly trying to defame me and steal my identity,
[2:16:05.120 --> 2:16:08.120]  and steal things I've really said but add lies into it.
[2:16:08.120 --> 2:16:11.120]  So, it's classical plagiarism that they obsess over.
[2:16:11.120 --> 2:16:15.120]  If Trump's wife has one word in her speech that doesn't somebody else's is plagiarism,
[2:16:15.120 --> 2:16:19.120]  but when they take whole pages of what I say but then add lies to it, that's okay.
[2:16:19.120 --> 2:16:21.120]  It's plagiarism.
[2:16:21.120 --> 2:16:24.120]  It's like plagia defamerism or defamerism.
[2:16:24.120 --> 2:16:26.120]  I don't have any word here.
[2:16:26.120 --> 2:16:28.120]  Defame plagiarism.
[2:16:28.120 --> 2:16:30.120]  Defaming plagiarism.
[2:16:30.120 --> 2:16:37.120]  I don't know what word you'd call that compound word, but that's what we're dealing with here.
[2:16:37.120 --> 2:16:39.120]  No one's ever accused me of faking war footage.
[2:16:39.120 --> 2:16:41.120]  No one's ever accused me of anything like this.
[2:16:41.120 --> 2:16:44.120]  They don't even have stuff they can say it's fake news I put out.
[2:16:44.120 --> 2:16:47.120]  Hell, 20th Century Fox and others, we put it on screen.
[2:16:47.120 --> 2:16:51.120]  This last week, the other fake news agency, they got 600 million from the CIA,
[2:16:51.120 --> 2:16:57.120]  The Washington Post, Jeff Bezos, Amazon, they admitted they're putting out all this fake news,
[2:16:57.120 --> 2:17:01.120]  and they had articles about how major movie houses put up fake news sites
[2:17:01.120 --> 2:17:06.120]  with fake news about Trump and myself to promote their movies, but that's okay.
[2:17:06.120 --> 2:17:08.120]  Here, I'll pull it up.
[2:17:08.120 --> 2:17:10.120]  Pull it up right here.
[2:17:10.120 --> 2:17:12.120]  Oh, we got it? Let's put it on screen then.
[2:17:12.120 --> 2:17:14.120]  It was on The Washington Post. Yeah, there it is, The New York Times.
[2:17:14.120 --> 2:17:18.120]  20th Century Fox gives real apology for a fake news campaign,
[2:17:18.120 --> 2:17:23.120]  which they are using that campaign in Congress saying ban me.
[2:17:23.120 --> 2:17:29.120]  20th Century Fox, CBS, NBC, we've shown you them all putting out fake news,
[2:17:29.120 --> 2:17:32.120]  and whose name do they put on it?
[2:17:32.120 --> 2:17:33.120]  Mine.
[2:17:33.120 --> 2:17:35.120]  And Donald Trump.
[2:17:35.120 --> 2:17:40.120]  In fact, I'm very honored that I'm attacked second only to Trump.
[2:17:40.120 --> 2:17:44.120]  I'm very honored, way worse than Bannon, worse than Drudge now, worse than anybody,
[2:17:44.120 --> 2:17:46.120]  because they know you're listening, they know you're watching,
[2:17:46.120 --> 2:17:48.120]  and these are real scum we're dealing with.
[2:17:48.120 --> 2:17:52.120]  I mean, when I say scum, I just prove to you they're scum.
[2:17:52.120 --> 2:17:59.120]  They show some fictional president with a fictional son that's killed, and then I,
[2:17:59.120 --> 2:18:03.120]  fresh off Saturday night, where I tell Trump black people aren't humans for 200 years,
[2:18:03.120 --> 2:18:08.120]  a.k.a. slavery, remember the two-thirds deal in your voting or whatever, all that horrible crap.
[2:18:08.120 --> 2:18:10.120]  Now I'm behind all that.
[2:18:10.120 --> 2:18:12.120]  I'm behind slavery.
[2:18:12.120 --> 2:18:19.120]  And then the next night, I'm defaming a gold star veteran and a gold star family with a fake video
[2:18:19.120 --> 2:18:22.120]  with the politicos sitting around deciding how to put out this information.
[2:18:22.120 --> 2:18:24.120]  What on earth?
[2:18:24.120 --> 2:18:31.120]  So a fake news program with actors putting out fake info says I'm fake.
[2:18:31.120 --> 2:18:36.120]  The circle is now complete.
[2:18:36.120 --> 2:18:40.120]  And it's day after day, week after week, why?
[2:18:40.120 --> 2:18:42.120]  Why? Why? Why?
[2:18:42.120 --> 2:18:46.120]  Because we expose globalism, because we knew that if the military and the police and the system
[2:18:46.120 --> 2:18:52.120]  and the people compartmentalized in government and corporations and private life knew what globalism really was,
[2:18:52.120 --> 2:18:54.120]  that people would stand against it.
[2:18:54.120 --> 2:18:57.120]  But we couldn't even get them to admit globalism existed five years ago,
[2:18:57.120 --> 2:18:59.120]  or the fellow reserve was private 10 years ago.
[2:18:59.120 --> 2:19:03.120]  Now everybody knows, even the dumbest of the dumb.
[2:19:03.120 --> 2:19:11.120]  So now they resort to this and only the weakest-minded mental patients.
[2:19:11.120 --> 2:19:14.120]  I've had them come up to me in D.C. when they were out there marching.
[2:19:14.120 --> 2:19:15.120]  I've had them on the streets of Austin.
[2:19:15.120 --> 2:19:18.120]  They go, how dare you put out that fake news?
[2:19:18.120 --> 2:19:21.120]  What was fake? You know what it is.
[2:19:21.120 --> 2:19:26.120]  I go, what? They go, I saw it on Colbert.
[2:19:26.120 --> 2:19:29.120]  This one lady and I was like, what did I do?
[2:19:29.120 --> 2:19:33.120]  You know, a lot of people are LGBT and we're not bad.
[2:19:33.120 --> 2:19:36.120]  I'm like, I didn't say that. I saw it.
[2:19:36.120 --> 2:19:38.120]  Come to work the next day.
[2:19:38.120 --> 2:19:40.120]  One of our crew members is told, you get out of your apartment.
[2:19:40.120 --> 2:19:42.120]  I'm pulling your lease.
[2:19:42.120 --> 2:19:45.120]  I saw what Colbert said, your boss is a homophobe.
[2:19:45.120 --> 2:19:47.120]  Even if I was, it's free speech.
[2:19:47.120 --> 2:19:49.120]  You kicked people out on the street, but I wasn't.
[2:19:49.120 --> 2:19:50.120]  It was a lie.
[2:19:50.120 --> 2:19:52.120]  This is war, people.
[2:19:52.120 --> 2:19:57.120]  These are dirtbag bullies that want to lie about people that aren't selling the country out.
[2:19:57.120 --> 2:19:59.120]  I'll be back.
[2:20:28.120 --> 2:20:33.120]  We use cell phones against our heads every day,
[2:20:33.120 --> 2:20:37.120]  but now a landmark US government study confirms increased health risks
[2:20:37.120 --> 2:20:40.120]  from exposure to EMF radiation emitted from these devices.
[2:20:40.120 --> 2:20:42.120]  The time to protect yourself is now.

[2:21:01.120 --> 2:21:03.120]  Hi there, Dick Holgeier here.
[2:21:03.120 --> 2:21:07.120]  I was a mainstream television news reporter for over three decades.
[2:21:07.120 --> 2:21:11.120]  I normally never do commercial endorsements.
[2:21:11.120 --> 2:21:13.120]  I am very skeptical of health supplements,
[2:21:13.120 --> 2:21:17.120]  but a friend of mine told me about his experience with Synergy One,
[2:21:17.120 --> 2:21:22.120]  so I purchased a bottle, and my wife and I have been using it for a few weeks now.
[2:21:22.120 --> 2:21:25.120]  I very much dislike so-called energy boosters,
[2:21:25.120 --> 2:21:29.120]  those little energy drinks that have caffeine and Guarana
[2:21:29.120 --> 2:21:31.120]  and other things that make your heart race.
[2:21:31.120 --> 2:21:32.120]  This is not that.
[2:21:32.120 --> 2:21:35.120]  My experience with Synergy One has been great.
[2:21:35.120 --> 2:21:38.120]  My mood is better, my joints feel better,
[2:21:38.120 --> 2:21:42.120]  I have more vigor, more stamina, way increased productivity.
[2:21:42.120 --> 2:21:46.120]  My wife and I both noticed that we even dream more,
[2:21:46.120 --> 2:21:48.120]  so I recommend Synergy One.
[2:21:48.120 --> 2:21:49.120]  It's really good stuff.
[2:21:49.120 --> 2:21:52.120]  I'm having great results with it.
[2:22:19.120 --> 2:22:24.120]  Superbeta Prostate
[2:22:50.120 --> 2:22:52.120]  This free offer won't last.
[2:22:52.120 --> 2:22:55.120]  Call 1-800-487-7242.
[2:22:55.120 --> 2:23:21.120]  That's 1-800-487-7242.
[2:23:25.120 --> 2:23:27.120]  This free offer won't last.
[2:23:55.120 --> 2:23:58.120]  Big Berkey Water Filters for the love of clean water.
[2:24:25.120 --> 2:24:37.120]  Clutch is some good stuff.
[2:24:37.120 --> 2:24:39.120]  Crank it up.
[2:24:39.120 --> 2:24:41.120]  Little snip dog.
[2:24:41.120 --> 2:24:43.120]  That's the perfect line, doesn't it?
[2:24:43.120 --> 2:24:46.120]  Hashtag I'm unloading.
[2:24:46.120 --> 2:24:49.120]  And then he calls for gun control.
[2:24:49.120 --> 2:24:52.120]  And then calls for killing Trump.
[2:24:52.120 --> 2:24:56.120]  We're so close, Snoop, to the gloves off,
[2:24:56.120 --> 2:24:58.120]  and all the punks and thugs that act so tough.
[2:24:58.120 --> 2:25:00.120]  We're gonna beg for their mommies.
[2:25:00.120 --> 2:25:02.120]  We're so close, Snoop.
[2:25:02.120 --> 2:25:06.120]  We're so close to the Venera civilization turning back.
[2:25:06.120 --> 2:25:09.120]  And all the people like you that have led children into prison
[2:25:09.120 --> 2:25:13.120]  and into the drug lifestyle are gonna beg for their mommies.
[2:25:13.120 --> 2:25:16.120]  So close right now, Snoop.
[2:25:16.120 --> 2:25:17.120]  So close.
[2:25:17.120 --> 2:25:20.120]  You just keep trying to open the door.
[2:25:20.120 --> 2:25:23.120]  I think that door might open.
[2:25:23.120 --> 2:25:26.120]  How's our military gonna respond?
[2:25:26.120 --> 2:25:29.120]  How are our veterans gonna respond to somebody like Snoop Dogg
[2:25:29.120 --> 2:25:32.120]  saying kill our president who's trying to get $25 million
[2:25:32.120 --> 2:25:34.120]  to black colleges and trying to get factory shipped
[2:25:34.120 --> 2:25:36.120]  into traditionally black areas
[2:25:36.120 --> 2:25:38.120]  and ordered the government to make it priority
[2:25:38.120 --> 2:25:41.120]  to hire black people?
[2:25:41.120 --> 2:25:44.120]  All SNL says he hates black people because I told him so.
[2:25:44.120 --> 2:25:47.120]  And then race pimps like you, pimp your own people.
[2:25:47.120 --> 2:25:50.120]  How did Snoop Dogg talk about how 51% of black people never get born?
[2:25:50.120 --> 2:25:52.120]  He's not. He's a selfish pimp.
[2:25:52.120 --> 2:25:54.120]  He's a piece of trash.
[2:25:54.120 --> 2:25:58.120]  And he thinks he can fuck around and talk about killing
[2:25:58.120 --> 2:26:00.120]  George Washington 2.0.
[2:26:00.120 --> 2:26:02.120]  Let me tell you something, Snoop.
[2:26:02.120 --> 2:26:04.120]  Well, if your doom is already dangerous,
[2:26:04.120 --> 2:26:06.120]  in case somebody didn't tell you,
[2:26:06.120 --> 2:26:10.120]  something happens to Trump.
[2:26:13.120 --> 2:26:16.120]  See, what you don't get is
[2:26:16.120 --> 2:26:20.120]  I don't come from the background you get as a snitch,
[2:26:20.120 --> 2:26:23.120]  put neighborhood kids in prison.
[2:26:23.120 --> 2:26:26.120]  See, I come from a background where we don't shoot our mouths off.
[2:26:26.120 --> 2:26:29.120]  See what we've done with info wars, old Snoopy?
[2:26:29.120 --> 2:26:31.120]  Change the world. Got the enemy on the run.
[2:26:31.120 --> 2:26:34.120]  Big governments on the run.
[2:26:34.120 --> 2:26:38.120]  And I think, I think examples need to start being made.
[2:26:38.120 --> 2:26:41.120]  I've said this media matters run by the Democrats.
[2:26:41.120 --> 2:26:43.120]  George Soros picked this up.
[2:26:43.120 --> 2:26:45.120]  I think it's time for the president to take the gloves off.
[2:26:45.120 --> 2:26:48.120]  Every day I see another entertainer saying kill President Trump.
[2:26:48.120 --> 2:26:50.120]  I just wonder if they understand this.
[2:26:50.120 --> 2:26:52.120]  What would happen if somebody said kill them?
[2:26:52.120 --> 2:26:54.120]  Of course, kind of people that'll kill you
[2:26:54.120 --> 2:26:59.120]  won't tell anybody they're coming to kill you, Snoop.
[2:26:59.120 --> 2:27:05.120]  You just dive a heart attack, you dumb bastard.
[2:27:05.120 --> 2:27:06.120]  I don't know if it'll be Snoop,
[2:27:06.120 --> 2:27:08.120]  because I mean, I certainly wouldn't hurt anybody.
[2:27:08.120 --> 2:27:09.120]  I wouldn't hurt a fly.
[2:27:09.120 --> 2:27:17.120]  I'm just all talk up here, right?
[2:27:17.120 --> 2:27:20.120]  Big man Snoop got that 357.
[2:27:20.120 --> 2:27:23.120]  Now he's going to get that Trump, isn't he?
[2:27:23.120 --> 2:27:25.120]  He's going to take that Trump down,
[2:27:25.120 --> 2:27:34.120]  that clown down real good, because he's real tough.
[2:27:34.120 --> 2:27:36.120]  What a punk.
[2:27:36.120 --> 2:27:41.120]  Just like Alec Baldwin, just like this other piece of trash.
[2:27:41.120 --> 2:27:43.120]  Jake Weber.
[2:27:43.120 --> 2:27:44.120]  Here's the difference.
[2:27:44.120 --> 2:27:47.120]  You're singing and talking and making fake videos about us, aren't you?
[2:27:47.120 --> 2:27:49.120]  Because you're the past, you're the losers,
[2:27:49.120 --> 2:27:52.120]  you're the failures, we're the future.
[2:27:52.120 --> 2:27:56.120]  Because you're the walking dead, you're zombies.
[2:27:56.120 --> 2:27:58.120]  You're the sell-outs of the system.
[2:27:58.120 --> 2:28:03.120]  You don't go into the future.
[2:28:03.120 --> 2:28:07.120]  You're dead already.
[2:28:07.120 --> 2:28:09.120]  That's a real skull.
[2:28:09.120 --> 2:28:11.120]  This is a man from India.
[2:28:11.120 --> 2:28:12.120]  It's an Indian skull.
[2:28:12.120 --> 2:28:15.120]  Heads aren't quite as big as mine.
[2:28:15.120 --> 2:28:18.120]  My skull's twice as thick as this skull.
[2:28:18.120 --> 2:28:22.120]  My brain's CC size is, let's just say just as big.
[2:28:22.120 --> 2:28:30.120]  But the point is, is that we're here looking at this head.
[2:28:30.120 --> 2:28:34.120]  And somebody that lives and had eyes and a nose,
[2:28:34.120 --> 2:28:38.120]  is probably a great person.
[2:28:38.120 --> 2:28:43.120]  And see, someday Snoop and Alec Baldwin,
[2:28:43.120 --> 2:28:53.120]  and old Jake Weber, they're going to be where this guy is.
[2:28:53.120 --> 2:29:01.120]  But while you're still alive, and while you still got a brain, Snoop,
[2:29:01.120 --> 2:29:04.120]  you might want to try to use it.
[2:29:04.120 --> 2:29:06.120]  Because here's the thing, I don't want to fight with anybody,
[2:29:06.120 --> 2:29:09.120]  but you want to kill us, you want to lie about us,
[2:29:09.120 --> 2:29:16.120]  you want to stop us from trying to empower the poorest people in this country.
[2:29:16.120 --> 2:29:20.120]  Well, just know this, you're not in the Hollywood MTV game
[2:29:20.120 --> 2:29:22.120]  making 10-year-old boys think you're tough.
[2:29:22.120 --> 2:29:25.120]  You're now in a man's world, Alec Baldwin,
[2:29:25.120 --> 2:29:28.120]  and Jake Weber and Snoop Dogg.
[2:29:28.120 --> 2:29:33.120]  And if this thing goes sideways and there's an actual fight,
[2:29:33.120 --> 2:29:37.120]  I think it's fair to say your names are on a list
[2:29:37.120 --> 2:29:40.120]  of people that have got some explaining to do.
[2:29:40.120 --> 2:29:43.120]  We're going to come back with big news about Obama,
[2:29:43.120 --> 2:29:46.120]  Robin Investors and the poorest Americans with some big breaking intel
[2:29:46.120 --> 2:29:50.120]  straight ahead on Alex Jones, and all our enemies have been warned.
[2:29:50.120 --> 2:29:54.120]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[2:29:54.120 --> 2:29:57.120]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:01.120 --> 2:30:05.120]  Well, folks, America is now offensive in America.
[2:30:05.120 --> 2:30:07.120]  At a high school basketball game in Des Moines, Iowa,
[2:30:07.120 --> 2:30:10.120]  the students from Valley High decided to have a USA themed crowd
[2:30:10.120 --> 2:30:12.120]  and wore red, white, and blue.
[2:30:12.120 --> 2:30:15.120]  Despite winning the game, they lost in social justice
[2:30:15.120 --> 2:30:19.120]  as coaches and fans of the other team were offended by the patriotic attire.
[2:30:19.120 --> 2:30:22.120]  See, Des Moines North is said to have 66% minority enrollment,
[2:30:22.120 --> 2:30:25.120]  compared to the 26% at Valley.
[2:30:25.120 --> 2:30:28.120]  As if saying one school as a majority minority isn't crazy enough,
[2:30:28.120 --> 2:30:31.120]  now they're saying it's offensive to wear red, white, and blue
[2:30:31.120 --> 2:30:33.120]  if you play against this school.
[2:30:33.120 --> 2:30:36.120]  The biggest issue was that there was a refugee on the North roster,
[2:30:36.120 --> 2:30:39.120]  but you'd think he would embrace the country that embraced him.
[2:30:39.120 --> 2:30:42.120]  This is a trend, as last year, Ramapo College vetoed
[2:30:42.120 --> 2:30:45.120]  an American themed barbecue hosted by college Republicans
[2:30:45.120 --> 2:30:47.120]  and college Democrats.
[2:30:47.120 --> 2:30:50.120]  So we can't even come together in patriotism under these liberals.
[2:30:50.120 --> 2:30:52.120]  What is wrong with these people?
[2:30:52.120 --> 2:30:54.120]  Next, they're going to want to remove the flag.
[2:30:54.120 --> 2:31:18.120]  This is Owen Schreuer for infowars.com, proud to be an American.

[2:32:01.120 --> 2:32:03.120]  Today, we call it bone broth,
[2:32:03.120 --> 2:32:06.120]  and for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits
[2:32:06.120 --> 2:32:10.120]  before it became a loss to our modern diet of processed junk.
[2:32:10.120 --> 2:32:13.120]  We are now introducing Caveman by infowarslife.com,
[2:32:13.120 --> 2:32:17.120]  the ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root,
[2:32:17.120 --> 2:32:22.120]  Saga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula.
[2:32:22.120 --> 2:32:26.120]  Caveman, it's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization
[2:32:26.120 --> 2:32:30.120]  that are our superior ancestors, and we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[2:32:30.120 --> 2:32:34.120]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[2:32:34.120 --> 2:32:36.120]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking,
[2:32:36.120 --> 2:32:39.120]  but you used the bones for strength,
[2:32:39.120 --> 2:32:42.120]  from the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors
[2:32:42.120 --> 2:32:44.120]  to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[2:32:44.120 --> 2:32:47.120]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[2:32:47.120 --> 2:32:50.120]  I'm a long way from the Caveman my ancestors were,
[2:32:50.120 --> 2:32:54.120]  but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were,
[2:32:54.120 --> 2:32:55.120]  and this is a big part of it.
[2:32:55.120 --> 2:32:57.120]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman,
[2:32:57.120 --> 2:33:26.120]  the ultimate paleo formula for yourself and ForestLives.com today.
[2:33:26.120 --> 2:33:27.120]  All right, now that you're on course,
[2:33:27.120 --> 2:33:28.120]  he's going to join us for like 10 minutes,
[2:33:28.120 --> 2:33:33.120]  and I want to open the phones up exclusively for Americans of African descent
[2:33:33.120 --> 2:33:34.120]  who disagree, agree, whatever.
[2:33:34.120 --> 2:33:37.120]  I mean, I see Snoop Dogg and Viacom and MTV.
[2:33:37.120 --> 2:33:38.120]  It's been well documented.
[2:33:38.120 --> 2:33:41.120]  I've had Professor Griff everybody on who heard about it.
[2:33:41.120 --> 2:33:44.120]  I've got it from the executives that were at MTV, rock stars, you name it,
[2:33:44.120 --> 2:33:45.120]  that were high level.
[2:33:45.120 --> 2:33:47.120]  They said in the late eighties, early nineties,
[2:33:47.120 --> 2:33:49.120]  you're going to put out gangster rap.
[2:33:49.120 --> 2:33:50.120]  We wanted these people to be primed.
[2:33:50.120 --> 2:33:53.120]  We basically put in prison, and now it's spread everywhere.
[2:33:53.120 --> 2:33:56.120]  The rap has like infested the Middle East.
[2:33:56.120 --> 2:33:58.120]  It's associated with crime everywhere that most of the rappers
[2:33:58.120 --> 2:33:59.120]  end up getting shot or put in prison.
[2:33:59.120 --> 2:34:02.120]  The others that don't, like Rick Ross is a former jail guard
[2:34:02.120 --> 2:34:05.120]  who pushes this whole gangster rap thing to get kids to think it's cool.
[2:34:05.120 --> 2:34:06.120]  People on the street think it's cool.
[2:34:06.120 --> 2:34:08.120]  They end up getting put in prison.
[2:34:08.120 --> 2:34:10.120]  That's why I want decriminalization of drugs
[2:34:10.120 --> 2:34:13.120]  to stop making it cool and take the money out of it, not legalization.
[2:34:13.120 --> 2:34:14.120]  The drug culture is horrible,
[2:34:14.120 --> 2:34:17.120]  but keeping any legal empowers all these scummy groups.
[2:34:17.120 --> 2:34:20.120]  And Snoop Dogg comes out with a music video calling for gun control
[2:34:20.120 --> 2:34:24.120]  but then saying kill President Trump with him simulating killing Trump.
[2:34:24.120 --> 2:34:27.120]  And all I'm saying to Snoop is, man,
[2:34:27.120 --> 2:34:29.120]  do you understand that you and all the Democrats
[2:34:29.120 --> 2:34:31.120]  and everybody else saying kill the president and all this other crap,
[2:34:31.120 --> 2:34:35.120]  you're messing with like the return of George Washington here, okay?
[2:34:35.120 --> 2:34:38.120]  I mean, Trump's delivered in 53 days.
[2:34:38.120 --> 2:34:43.120]  Massive new jobs report people with a true focus on African-American areas.
[2:34:43.120 --> 2:34:47.120]  25 billion when Obama gave 4 billion to the black colleges.
[2:34:47.120 --> 2:34:49.120]  Just everything is good.
[2:34:49.120 --> 2:34:52.120]  And you're sitting there on Saturday Night Live saying,
[2:34:52.120 --> 2:34:53.120]  I don't like black people.
[2:34:53.120 --> 2:34:55.120]  They're aliens.
[2:34:55.120 --> 2:34:57.120]  That's quoting Alec Baldwin as the president.
[2:34:57.120 --> 2:34:59.120]  And he says, I learned it from Alex Jones.
[2:34:59.120 --> 2:35:02.120]  And then they have the new Homeland Show with Jake Weber saying basically the same crap
[2:35:02.120 --> 2:35:04.120]  and I'm setting up innocent veterans and stuff.
[2:35:04.120 --> 2:35:05.120]  And it's supposed to be Alex Jones.
[2:35:05.120 --> 2:35:07.120]  This is weaponized media.
[2:35:07.120 --> 2:35:10.120]  Do you understand what happens in countries
[2:35:10.120 --> 2:35:14.120]  when you try to kill a president and every news channel promotes killing them?
[2:35:14.120 --> 2:35:15.120]  Do you understand what happens if you fail?
[2:35:15.120 --> 2:35:20.120]  You're going to go to prison for this.
[2:35:20.120 --> 2:35:22.120]  You're not going to get away with this.
[2:35:22.120 --> 2:35:24.120]  And we understand this is total war.
[2:35:24.120 --> 2:35:25.120]  We get it.
[2:35:25.120 --> 2:35:27.120]  I mean, 90% of the military is awake.
[2:35:27.120 --> 2:35:30.120]  80% of the CIA is already on the patriots side.
[2:35:30.120 --> 2:35:32.120]  You people are in deep trouble, folks.
[2:35:32.120 --> 2:35:33.120]  You're in deep trouble.
[2:35:33.120 --> 2:35:37.120]  I know 15 years ago and 12 years ago from multiple sources,
[2:35:37.120 --> 2:35:40.120]  SEAL Team 6 was ordered to watch my show, listen to my show.
[2:35:40.120 --> 2:35:43.120]  Special Operations Command, people were like, watch this.
[2:35:43.120 --> 2:35:45.120]  And that was from higher ups.
[2:35:45.120 --> 2:35:47.120]  Shane, we're going to move against the global in the future.
[2:35:47.120 --> 2:35:49.120]  We can't tell you all the classified stuff.
[2:35:49.120 --> 2:35:50.120]  Watch this.
[2:35:50.120 --> 2:35:51.120]  This guy's got it all figured out.
[2:35:51.120 --> 2:35:52.120]  And I'm not bragging.
[2:35:52.120 --> 2:35:53.120]  There was Dr. Corsi.
[2:35:53.120 --> 2:35:54.120]  There was Lou Dobbs.
[2:35:54.120 --> 2:35:56.120]  There was Matt Drudge exposing it.
[2:35:56.120 --> 2:35:57.120]  People like Joseph Farrah.
[2:35:57.120 --> 2:35:59.120]  We have the biggest audience other than Drudge.
[2:35:59.120 --> 2:36:01.120]  And Drudge magnifies what we're doing.
[2:36:01.120 --> 2:36:02.120]  And I love that Drudge is there.
[2:36:02.120 --> 2:36:03.120]  God, it feels so good.
[2:36:03.120 --> 2:36:04.120]  I wish there were 10 Drudges.
[2:36:04.120 --> 2:36:05.120]  This isn't competition.
[2:36:05.120 --> 2:36:08.120]  This is life or death because they know they're losing.
[2:36:08.120 --> 2:36:09.120]  And they know they're in trouble.
[2:36:09.120 --> 2:36:13.120]  And they're so scared that people might grow a brain in this country
[2:36:13.120 --> 2:36:17.120]  and actually realize how they've been manipulated.
[2:36:17.120 --> 2:36:24.120]  So I want to open the phones up for African-American listeners to the show
[2:36:24.120 --> 2:36:26.120]  to give me your take on this.
[2:36:26.120 --> 2:36:30.120]  And the take of, you know, if you saw Serenade Live where they have
[2:36:30.120 --> 2:36:32.120]  Alec Baldwin playing the part of the president,
[2:36:32.120 --> 2:36:35.120]  I can't even do imitations anymore because they'll actually take the clip
[2:36:35.120 --> 2:36:36.120]  and show it like I said it.
[2:36:36.120 --> 2:36:38.120]  They've done this.
[2:36:38.120 --> 2:36:40.120]  Two weeks ago, they've done it a bunch.
[2:36:40.120 --> 2:36:43.120]  I said, you know, they'll say I'm anti-gay when I'm not anti-gay
[2:36:43.120 --> 2:36:44.120]  and I never have been.
[2:36:44.120 --> 2:36:47.120]  And then Colbert has me going, I'm anti-gay.
[2:36:47.120 --> 2:36:49.120]  And my lawyer say, yeah, you can swim.
[2:36:49.120 --> 2:36:51.120]  You can probably win, but it'll cost millions to take years.
[2:36:51.120 --> 2:36:55.120]  I don't have time, but at the same time, it's like, you know,
[2:36:55.120 --> 2:36:57.120]  now I don't think black people are human.
[2:36:57.120 --> 2:36:58.120]  I never said that.
[2:36:58.120 --> 2:37:00.120]  What that, you know, this is, and it's not that it is even hurting me.
[2:37:00.120 --> 2:37:06.120]  It's that, wow, they put it in the mouth of the president with Alec Baldwin.
[2:37:06.120 --> 2:37:07.120]  When all I want is prosperity for everybody.
[2:37:07.120 --> 2:37:10.120]  I want to see everybody off the Democratic plantation.
[2:37:10.120 --> 2:37:13.120]  I genuinely care about everybody.
[2:37:13.120 --> 2:37:16.120]  I protested the Ku Klux Klan more than 15 times.
[2:37:16.120 --> 2:37:21.120]  My dad's dad got elected as a, as an Eisenhower Republican in East Texas
[2:37:21.120 --> 2:37:23.120]  to desegregate the schools.
[2:37:23.120 --> 2:37:26.120]  And I still, as a kid, sometimes we'd be at the grocery store
[2:37:26.120 --> 2:37:31.120]  and people walk over to my grandmother and say, f you inward lover for what you've done.
[2:37:31.120 --> 2:37:34.120]  And I'm not just saying that happened.
[2:37:34.120 --> 2:37:38.120]  And both my grandfather's almost died in World War II fighting Hitler in the Army Air Corps.
[2:37:38.120 --> 2:37:45.120]  And then I get to see the Jewish forward say, I love Hitler and not even show a quote.
[2:37:45.120 --> 2:37:48.120]  Man, it's next level lies, folks.
[2:37:48.120 --> 2:37:49.120]  It's next level evil.
[2:37:49.120 --> 2:37:50.120]  And it's wrong.
[2:37:50.120 --> 2:37:52.120]  It's wrong.
[2:37:52.120 --> 2:37:56.120]  But why they're scared of us is they know we put out stories every day that are exclusive,
[2:37:56.120 --> 2:38:00.120]  that the White House leaks to us that sources tell us to go to in Congress.
[2:38:00.120 --> 2:38:04.120]  And former head of, vice head of the intelligence committee on just two weeks ago,
[2:38:04.120 --> 2:38:06.120]  Hurt Weldon saying, I've seen all the documents.
[2:38:06.120 --> 2:38:09.120]  Hillary's a Chinese communist agent on the Russian payroll.
[2:38:09.120 --> 2:38:12.120]  Well, that's in the news now, but didn't even get picked up in the news.
[2:38:12.120 --> 2:38:13.120]  But you got picked up here.
[2:38:13.120 --> 2:38:14.120]  You saw it.
[2:38:14.120 --> 2:38:15.120]  You heard it.
[2:38:15.120 --> 2:38:19.120]  And his latest article confirmed, Treasury report confirms what we said two weeks ago.
[2:38:19.120 --> 2:38:23.120]  Obama stole from Fannie and Freddie investors, nearly 200 billion to fund Obamacare.
[2:38:23.120 --> 2:38:28.120]  And that's only part of the documents we've gotten that came out in lawsuits that the White House directed us to.
[2:38:28.120 --> 2:38:30.120]  So yeah, they're pissed, folks.
[2:38:30.120 --> 2:38:33.120]  They're pissed that Fox is chicken and won't put this out.
[2:38:33.120 --> 2:38:34.120]  Others are.
[2:38:34.120 --> 2:38:35.120]  But Drudge will.
[2:38:35.120 --> 2:38:36.120]  Info wars will.
[2:38:36.120 --> 2:38:37.120]  Daily caller will.
[2:38:37.120 --> 2:38:38.120]  World net Daily will.
[2:38:38.120 --> 2:38:39.120]  They're mad.
[2:38:39.120 --> 2:38:40.120]  They're mad.
[2:38:40.120 --> 2:38:42.120]  The president's got somebody on the ground that'll tell the truth.
[2:38:42.120 --> 2:38:50.120]  And in response to national TV shows saying I that I hate veterans and black people.
[2:38:50.120 --> 2:38:52.120]  Just unbelievable.
[2:38:52.120 --> 2:38:53.120]  With no proof.
[2:38:53.120 --> 2:38:55.120]  Just they just they have actors doing it.
[2:38:55.120 --> 2:38:57.120]  I mean, it's next level.
[2:38:57.120 --> 2:39:00.120]  And so that's why I'm harping on this is because it isn't about me getting attacked.
[2:39:00.120 --> 2:39:05.120]  It's every day they're saying kill Donald Trump all over TV, media, entertainment news.
[2:39:05.120 --> 2:39:06.120]  No one gets in trouble.
[2:39:06.120 --> 2:39:08.120]  I know they want to make you look like an authoritarian.
[2:39:08.120 --> 2:39:09.120]  They're trying to bait him into a deal.
[2:39:09.120 --> 2:39:11.120]  He's trying to get the economy turned back on.
[2:39:11.120 --> 2:39:14.120]  And hopefully then he knows the public will wake up, which the privilege shows.
[2:39:14.120 --> 2:39:16.120]  But I think the president is miscalculating.
[2:39:16.120 --> 2:39:19.120]  And I said it was a miscalculation to get rid of Flynn.
[2:39:19.120 --> 2:39:21.120]  Turns out Trump didn't even do that.
[2:39:21.120 --> 2:39:25.120]  They steamrolled him and tricked him into doing it like like they do to see for staff.
[2:39:25.120 --> 2:39:26.120]  Same thing happened.
[2:39:26.120 --> 2:39:30.120]  I said on Thursday, I said, this is no way Trump did this to sessions.
[2:39:30.120 --> 2:39:33.120]  He admits he met with the Russian ambassador twice.
[2:39:33.120 --> 2:39:34.120]  That's on his book.
[2:39:34.120 --> 2:39:35.120]  He didn't meet with him in the campaign.
[2:39:35.120 --> 2:39:37.120]  And of course, the Clintons have met even more.
[2:39:37.120 --> 2:39:38.120]  It's come out.
[2:39:38.120 --> 2:39:39.120]  That's totally normal.
[2:39:39.120 --> 2:39:40.120]  And it turned out Trump didn't do that.
[2:39:40.120 --> 2:39:42.120]  They stampeded sessions and doing it.
[2:39:42.120 --> 2:39:45.120]  And people inside his administration told him to do it.
[2:39:45.120 --> 2:39:48.120]  Without Trump's approval because Trump tries to delegate.
[2:39:48.120 --> 2:39:49.120]  And he's like he yelled at him.
[2:39:49.120 --> 2:39:50.120]  He said it was it.
[2:39:50.120 --> 2:39:51.120]  I heard about it before.
[2:39:51.120 --> 2:39:52.120]  It was in the news.
[2:39:52.120 --> 2:39:53.120]  He literally blew up and left.
[2:39:53.120 --> 2:39:57.120]  He said, I can't believe you people won't stand up to these people.
[2:39:57.120 --> 2:39:58.120]  So he's committed.
[2:39:58.120 --> 2:39:59.120]  He's very fatalistic about it.
[2:39:59.120 --> 2:40:04.120]  I can tell you that he's told people that he's known for a long time that I'm ready.
[2:40:04.120 --> 2:40:05.120]  I'm not stopping.
[2:40:05.120 --> 2:40:06.120]  I'm just doing the right thing.
[2:40:06.120 --> 2:40:08.120]  And I don't care what happens.
[2:40:08.120 --> 2:40:12.120]  And America deserves all this reform and all this success and they're going to get it.
[2:40:12.120 --> 2:40:16.120]  But it makes me physically sick to see them not just lying about me because I'm much.
[2:40:16.120 --> 2:40:19.120]  I'm the second most attacked person now, which is a great honor.
[2:40:19.120 --> 2:40:22.120]  But when I say that, it's like a hundred times more against Trump.
[2:40:22.120 --> 2:40:25.120]  I'm attacked every day, everywhere with incredible lies with him.
[2:40:25.120 --> 2:40:26.120]  It's hundreds of times a day.
[2:40:26.120 --> 2:40:29.120]  And so they don't want you to hear this info that course he's got.
[2:40:29.120 --> 2:40:32.120]  They want to Twitter is starting to block us.
[2:40:32.120 --> 2:40:33.120]  It's all happening.
[2:40:33.120 --> 2:40:35.120]  They're coming after us, folks.
[2:40:35.120 --> 2:40:36.120]  You want somebody to fight?
[2:40:36.120 --> 2:40:37.120]  You want somebody to stand up?
[2:40:37.120 --> 2:40:38.120]  We're doing it.
[2:40:38.120 --> 2:40:39.120]  And I'm not bitching.
[2:40:39.120 --> 2:40:40.120]  I expect to be attacked.
[2:40:40.120 --> 2:40:43.120]  Just know the epic level of this war.
[2:40:43.120 --> 2:40:47.120]  So when I tell Snoop Dogg saying kill the president, I don't care what happens to Snoop Dogg.
[2:40:47.120 --> 2:40:48.120]  I'm not against Snoop Dogg.
[2:40:48.120 --> 2:40:52.120]  But man, he wants to be in this world of calling for killing people and stuff.
[2:40:52.120 --> 2:40:57.120]  Dude, we're not in the make believe tough guy rap world of MTV, man.
[2:40:57.120 --> 2:41:04.120]  I mean, let me tell you, the Democrats and people are very, very close.
[2:41:04.120 --> 2:41:06.120]  And it's not going to be the way they think it's going to be.
[2:41:06.120 --> 2:41:08.120]  I mean, you guys are foreign enemies.
[2:41:08.120 --> 2:41:10.120]  You're trying to overthrow the country.
[2:41:10.120 --> 2:41:12.120]  You're openly calling for sedition.
[2:41:12.120 --> 2:41:15.120]  You brought out the race riot crap out of Ferguson again.
[2:41:15.120 --> 2:41:16.120]  You're doing all this openly.
[2:41:16.120 --> 2:41:18.120]  It's in your own white papers, your own admissions.
[2:41:18.120 --> 2:41:21.120]  You're claiming we're the foreign enemy when you're the globalist.
[2:41:21.120 --> 2:41:24.120]  And I'm just letting you know we kicked your ass in the election.
[2:41:24.120 --> 2:41:27.120]  And if you start some civil war, it's going to happen there too.
[2:41:27.120 --> 2:41:30.120]  And we're not going to just fight your dumb cannon fodder.
[2:41:30.120 --> 2:41:34.120]  The police and the military are going to go around the dumb asses you got burning stuff in the street.
[2:41:34.120 --> 2:41:38.120]  And every one of you globalists better be on those planes to Kauai and Tasmania.
[2:41:38.120 --> 2:41:39.120]  And that's not a threat.
[2:41:39.120 --> 2:41:41.120]  I can look at the tea leaves and tell where this is going.
[2:41:41.120 --> 2:41:43.120]  I don't want it to be this way.
[2:41:43.120 --> 2:41:45.120]  I want prosperity and I want a future.
[2:41:45.120 --> 2:41:49.120]  But if you want to fight and you're looking for one, this isn't fake world.
[2:41:49.120 --> 2:41:52.120]  We're about getting things done and changing the world.
[2:41:52.120 --> 2:41:53.120]  Of course, you got big news.
[2:41:53.120 --> 2:41:54.120]  You're trying to censor them.
[2:41:54.120 --> 2:41:56.120]  I'll take the calls at 800-25-99-231.
[2:41:56.120 --> 2:41:58.120]  A little bit of the next hour with David Knight.
[2:41:58.120 --> 2:42:01.120]  He's been off for a week of well-deserved vacation in Florida with a family.
[2:42:01.120 --> 2:42:05.120]  800-25-99-231 here in our great republic.
[2:42:05.120 --> 2:42:07.120]  800-25-99-231.
[2:42:07.120 --> 2:42:11.120]  But I want to hear specifically from black folks about what do you make of this?
[2:42:11.120 --> 2:42:13.120]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[2:42:13.120 --> 2:42:15.120]  Now, you look at the numbers.
[2:42:15.120 --> 2:42:18.120]  All Trump's doing, no president has ever, not even Abraham Lincoln,
[2:42:18.120 --> 2:42:21.120]  tried to deliver to black people in this country like Trump's doing.
[2:42:21.120 --> 2:42:23.120]  It's actually, it's crazy.
[2:42:23.120 --> 2:42:24.120]  I mean, it's crazy.
[2:42:24.120 --> 2:42:28.120]  And then to see the full attack by the bottom paid for controlled assets.
[2:42:28.120 --> 2:42:31.120]  I want to make sure all the blacks get put in prison and aborted like Snoop Dogg.
[2:42:31.120 --> 2:42:32.120]  It's sickening.
[2:42:32.120 --> 2:42:34.120]  So 800-25-99-231.
[2:42:34.120 --> 2:42:36.120]  800-25-99-231.
[2:42:36.120 --> 2:42:38.120]  I apologize for your calling earlier.
[2:42:38.120 --> 2:42:39.120]  I didn't give them the number.
[2:42:39.120 --> 2:42:41.120]  Obviously, they don't turn the phone system on to that.
[2:42:41.120 --> 2:42:43.120]  I'm going to get you back to your writing and your work and everything that's happening
[2:42:43.120 --> 2:42:45.120]  as you form the DC Bureau there in DC.
[2:42:45.120 --> 2:42:47.120]  But this new story is big.
[2:42:47.120 --> 2:42:51.120]  But what do you make of the all out fake news attack on myself and Trump?
[2:42:51.120 --> 2:42:52.120]  Well, it's going to continue.
[2:42:52.120 --> 2:42:55.120]  I mean, it's also going on Roger Stone.
[2:42:55.120 --> 2:42:56.120]  Been writing about that all day.
[2:42:56.120 --> 2:42:57.120]  Oh, he's a Russian agent.
[2:42:57.120 --> 2:42:58.120]  Yeah.
[2:42:58.120 --> 2:43:00.120]  He's a Russian agent.
[2:43:00.120 --> 2:43:02.120]  And the Democrats are just in denial.
[2:43:02.120 --> 2:43:06.120]  The ones who were close to Putin were Hillary and Podesta,
[2:43:06.120 --> 2:43:09.120]  both of whom were getting paid by them, by the Russians.
[2:43:09.120 --> 2:43:11.120]  And that's all come out.
[2:43:11.120 --> 2:43:14.120]  But what I'm asking you is, I've never seen the media and the system allow mainstream
[2:43:14.120 --> 2:43:17.120]  people to say kill Trump everywhere and organize.
[2:43:17.120 --> 2:43:18.120]  This is organized crime.
[2:43:18.120 --> 2:43:20.120]  If I was saying this about Obama, I should be arrested.
[2:43:20.120 --> 2:43:22.120]  I never called for violence against Obama.
[2:43:22.120 --> 2:43:24.120]  This is wrong.
[2:43:24.120 --> 2:43:26.120]  They just can't keep doing this.
[2:43:26.120 --> 2:43:29.120]  It is very shocking.
[2:43:29.120 --> 2:43:34.120]  I mean, if anyone had ever said this about President Obama,
[2:43:34.120 --> 2:43:38.120]  you'd have Secret Service knocking on your door that afternoon.
[2:43:38.120 --> 2:43:44.120]  But of course, now that the mainstream media and these artists are out there
[2:43:44.120 --> 2:43:48.120]  saying outrageous things of violence they're going to do to the president,
[2:43:48.120 --> 2:43:51.120]  it's just considered to be normal.
[2:43:51.120 --> 2:43:52.120]  I mean, it's shocking.
[2:43:52.120 --> 2:43:53.120]  And the Secret Service needs to...
[2:43:53.120 --> 2:43:56.120]  They've taken our restraint for weakness.
[2:43:56.120 --> 2:44:04.120]  Well, and also, the attacks are intensifying because the stakes are now so high.
[2:44:04.120 --> 2:44:10.120]  The left knows it lost, Hillary lost, and it can catastrophically.
[2:44:10.120 --> 2:44:12.120]  I want the gloves off on Snoop Dogg.
[2:44:12.120 --> 2:44:13.120]  I want the gloves off.
[2:44:13.120 --> 2:44:14.120]  Go ahead.
[2:44:14.120 --> 2:44:15.120]  You should have them.
[2:44:15.120 --> 2:44:18.120]  I mean, I do want to cover what we've got in this article today.
[2:44:18.120 --> 2:44:19.120]  No, I know it's big.
[2:44:19.120 --> 2:44:22.120]  This is why they're trying to block us because they want to ignore the huge stories
[2:44:22.120 --> 2:44:25.120]  you and others are putting out that are absolutely groundbreaking.
[2:44:25.120 --> 2:44:27.120]  You put this out almost two weeks ago.
[2:44:27.120 --> 2:44:29.120]  Now, New Treasury docs have confirmed your analysis.
[2:44:29.120 --> 2:44:31.120]  And again, you got a Harvard degree.
[2:44:31.120 --> 2:44:32.120]  You're a top finance expert.
[2:44:32.120 --> 2:44:33.120]  Go ahead.
[2:44:33.120 --> 2:44:40.120]  What we did is I worked with an expert from who was an outside auditor for Freddie.
[2:44:40.120 --> 2:44:47.120]  We went through the Treasury annual reports and could document where the money was taken
[2:44:47.120 --> 2:44:53.120]  from the investors from Freddie and the two large mortgage giants.
[2:44:53.120 --> 2:44:59.120]  The Treasury put it into their general fund, and then we watched the accounting.
[2:44:59.120 --> 2:45:05.120]  The Excel chart, which shows exactly how the money was diverted into health and Medicare,
[2:45:05.120 --> 2:45:12.120]  and the dollar flows are dramatically a pattern that confirms when the money was taken out
[2:45:12.120 --> 2:45:16.120]  of Annie and Freddie, Treasury shuffled it off and did this commerce and housing, and
[2:45:16.120 --> 2:45:20.120]  then it ends up in their line items for expenditures and health and Medicare.
[2:45:20.120 --> 2:45:23.120]  And I've looked at the federal law and you've covered it.
[2:45:23.120 --> 2:45:24.120]  It's totally illegal.
[2:45:24.120 --> 2:45:25.120]  Totally illegal.
[2:45:25.120 --> 2:45:28.120]  And this also proves and why it's so important right now.
[2:45:28.120 --> 2:45:31.120]  It's time for all these gangster thugs, the Democratic Party, that want to fight.
[2:45:31.120 --> 2:45:33.120]  It's time they start getting one.
[2:45:33.120 --> 2:45:35.120]  Of course, they'll just blow up a school and say we did it.
[2:45:35.120 --> 2:45:39.120]  No, I mean, it's time politically for them to get their asses indicted for this and everything else.
[2:45:39.120 --> 2:45:48.120]  This shows, Alex, that Obamacare was bankrupt, and if the Obama administration had not illegally
[2:45:48.120 --> 2:45:54.120]  taken money that was never appropriated for this purpose, looted it, and robbed the investors.
[2:45:54.120 --> 2:45:55.120]  I mean, there's lawsuits on this.
[2:45:55.120 --> 2:46:01.120]  The investors were, this is the biggest theft of corporate dividends in U.S. financial history.
[2:46:01.120 --> 2:46:03.120]  Which is also meant to blow up.
[2:46:03.120 --> 2:46:06.120]  You know, he was always an enemy of this investment because it was actually government doing good
[2:46:06.120 --> 2:46:08.120]  for people and actually creating wealth.
[2:46:08.120 --> 2:46:10.120]  So Obama spent his eight years trying to destroy it.
[2:46:10.120 --> 2:46:11.120]  Why is that?
[2:46:11.120 --> 2:46:16.120]  Well, you know, this is a whole income shifting to the low income.
[2:46:16.120 --> 2:46:17.120]  This is what Obamacare wanted.
[2:46:17.120 --> 2:46:19.120]  Because the elites want renters, they admit that.
[2:46:19.120 --> 2:46:21.120]  Goldman Sachs admits they don't want Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
[2:46:21.120 --> 2:46:23.120]  They don't want home ownership.
[2:46:23.120 --> 2:46:28.120]  That's right, and they want, the whole purpose behind this is Obama had a war on against
[2:46:28.120 --> 2:46:30.120]  the class home ownership.
[2:46:30.120 --> 2:46:35.120]  He wanted to change the United States from home owners, the American dream, the renter,
[2:46:35.120 --> 2:46:40.120]  own your own home, into well housed nation of renters like Europe.
[2:46:40.120 --> 2:46:43.120]  And the only subsidies would have been to the low income.
[2:46:43.120 --> 2:46:44.120]  To cough in apartments.
[2:46:44.120 --> 2:46:47.120]  And that's in the treasury documents.
[2:46:47.120 --> 2:46:51.120]  We have that fully disclosed, and this is all ironclad.
[2:46:51.120 --> 2:46:57.120]  I mean, if you take a look at the article today, it's a very detailed financial analysis
[2:46:57.120 --> 2:47:02.120]  of the treasury department's own annual reports and their own accounting.
[2:47:02.120 --> 2:47:08.120]  The documents where the money went into and from the investors stolen from Fannie and Freddie
[2:47:08.120 --> 2:47:12.120]  shifted into Obamacare to keep Obamacare going bankrupt.
[2:47:12.120 --> 2:47:14.120]  It's a huge story.
[2:47:14.120 --> 2:47:18.120]  And by the way, I wrote this article today because the Washington examiner doubted that
[2:47:18.120 --> 2:47:20.120]  we could do this analysis.
[2:47:20.120 --> 2:47:24.120]  And I want to show the Washington examiner that they're the ones who are wrong.
[2:47:24.120 --> 2:47:27.120]  They're the ones who didn't know how to read the financials of the treasury department.
[2:47:27.120 --> 2:47:33.120]  And Maria Bartiroma has picked this up on Fox Business and has started making it a major issue.
[2:47:33.120 --> 2:47:38.120]  One of her largest tweets ever, she did it on Friday, and this issue is now going viral.
[2:47:38.120 --> 2:47:39.120]  And let's be clear.
[2:47:39.120 --> 2:47:41.120]  See, we don't operate like other news organizations.
[2:47:41.120 --> 2:47:44.120]  I call up the Augustum all the time to promote their website, their news organization.
[2:47:44.120 --> 2:47:47.120]  They go, oh, the owner says, I'm not going to name names.
[2:47:47.120 --> 2:47:48.120]  We're not supposed to go on your show now.
[2:47:48.120 --> 2:47:51.120]  And I'm like, do you understand we're trying to win the war?
[2:47:51.120 --> 2:47:54.120]  Our platform, in this case, was like 20 times bigger, conservatively.
[2:47:54.120 --> 2:47:55.120]  They go, no, we know that.
[2:47:55.120 --> 2:47:56.120]  They don't get it.
[2:47:56.120 --> 2:47:58.120]  We want people to come on.
[2:47:58.120 --> 2:48:02.120]  When you write these articles, you give, I've told you, but you agree with me.
[2:48:02.120 --> 2:48:06.120]  You go to these meetings, you give them your research that you're doing with your White House sources,
[2:48:06.120 --> 2:48:10.120]  and they just can't even believe that someone else is giving them the scoop.
[2:48:10.120 --> 2:48:12.120]  We want to defeat them.
[2:48:12.120 --> 2:48:16.120]  We don't care about having our article read more than yours.
[2:48:16.120 --> 2:48:19.120]  Of course, he's already had three number one New York Times sellers.
[2:48:19.120 --> 2:48:22.120]  I've already got the biggest political talk show even bigger than Limbaugh now overall.
[2:48:22.120 --> 2:48:25.120]  I'm not trying to be the biggest guy.
[2:48:25.120 --> 2:48:27.120]  Drudge is 10 times bigger with overall click.
[2:48:27.120 --> 2:48:28.120]  I love that.
[2:48:28.120 --> 2:48:29.120]  I want to defeat them.
[2:48:29.120 --> 2:48:30.120]  Understand that.
[2:48:30.120 --> 2:48:32.120]  We have to work together.
[2:48:32.120 --> 2:48:34.120]  But that's one big problem in conservative libertarian media.
[2:48:34.120 --> 2:48:37.120]  Even with stuff super hardcore, you go to people's sites.
[2:48:37.120 --> 2:48:38.120]  It's all their stuff.
[2:48:38.120 --> 2:48:40.120]  And then, and then that never ours or theirs.
[2:48:40.120 --> 2:48:41.120]  You go to info wars.
[2:48:41.120 --> 2:48:43.120]  It's everybody's stuff.
[2:48:43.120 --> 2:48:47.120]  I mean, don't people get we're in a total battle here?
[2:48:47.120 --> 2:48:49.120]  Every ounce of our energy matters.
[2:48:49.120 --> 2:48:53.120]  It's got to be directed downstream in the war at the enemy.
[2:48:53.120 --> 2:49:00.120]  What we've got here, Alex, is this is the Treasury Department's own financial analysis.
[2:49:00.120 --> 2:49:03.120]  You have their own internal documents, huge bombshell.
[2:49:03.120 --> 2:49:04.120]  Exactly.
[2:49:04.120 --> 2:49:05.120]  Exactly.
[2:49:05.120 --> 2:49:09.120]  And we're guided through this by one of the former auditors from Freddie.
[2:49:09.120 --> 2:49:13.120]  The documents have come to us through the White House sources.
[2:49:13.120 --> 2:49:14.120]  They were tipped off.
[2:49:14.120 --> 2:49:17.120]  And this could destroy Obama and all these criminals.
[2:49:17.120 --> 2:49:20.120]  This is bigger than the Haiti scam by an order of 100 times.
[2:49:20.120 --> 2:49:21.120]  Haiti's $2 billion.
[2:49:21.120 --> 2:49:22.120]  This is $200 billion.
[2:49:22.120 --> 2:49:24.120]  And by the way, I noticed you've only gotten a few years of it.
[2:49:24.120 --> 2:49:25.120]  You've got two years of the eight years.
[2:49:25.120 --> 2:49:26.120]  It's much worse.
[2:49:26.120 --> 2:49:30.120]  Yes, it goes all, ultimately $260 billion.
[2:49:30.120 --> 2:49:35.120]  It's the biggest theft of a dividend, a private corporate dividend in the US corporate.
[2:49:35.120 --> 2:49:43.120]  So the way to phrase this to break it out is Obama did secret bail in rating private investments to fund his programs.
[2:49:43.120 --> 2:49:44.120]  That's it.
[2:49:44.120 --> 2:49:45.120]  Just like Greece did.
[2:49:45.120 --> 2:49:50.120]  Just like what's the other island, Cyprus did.
[2:49:50.120 --> 2:49:53.120]  Obama did a bail in secret Obama bail in discovered.
[2:49:53.120 --> 2:49:55.120]  There's your headline.
[2:49:55.120 --> 2:49:56.120]  You're right.
[2:49:56.120 --> 2:50:01.120]  And also the sub headline is Obama was happy to throw middle class homeowners to the dogs.
[2:50:01.120 --> 2:50:07.120]  It was going to end the 30 year mortgage, which is a key mortgage that gets people into their first homes.
[2:50:07.120 --> 2:50:09.120]  It has for decades.
[2:50:09.120 --> 2:50:15.120]  And Obama, the documents we have where they internally discussed eliminating closing Freddie and Fannie,
[2:50:15.120 --> 2:50:20.120]  they admit that they're going to do detriment to the middle class homeowners market.
[2:50:20.120 --> 2:50:23.120]  They're going to make homeownership more expensive in America.
[2:50:23.120 --> 2:50:25.120]  And the Obama administration doesn't care.
[2:50:25.120 --> 2:50:31.120]  Well, I want to invite you on the nightly news tonight to do a 15 minute report, roll through the documents with the host tonight.
[2:50:31.120 --> 2:50:34.120]  So we can really put this out tomorrow because the headlines key.
[2:50:34.120 --> 2:50:36.120]  This is a strong headline, but it's so criminal.
[2:50:36.120 --> 2:50:37.120]  It's got to be.
[2:50:37.120 --> 2:50:43.120]  I mean, the truth is that Obama was caught in secret bail ins rating private investment funds committing massive felonies.
[2:50:43.120 --> 2:50:45.120]  So there's our real headline.
[2:50:45.120 --> 2:50:46.120]  We need to get this out.
[2:50:46.120 --> 2:50:47.120]  Great job, Dr. Corsi.
[2:50:47.120 --> 2:50:52.120]  I'm going to have Rob do call you right now to see when you can tape for the nightly news to walk through these documents one by one.
[2:50:52.120 --> 2:50:58.120]  We're going to come back with callers out there on SNL's lie that Donald Trump hates black people claiming he got it from me.
[2:50:58.120 --> 2:51:26.120]  Because Alec Baldwin said so by now you know that wireless technology like cell phones do in fact pose dangers to the health and privacy of everyone.
[2:51:26.120 --> 2:51:31.120]  9 6 1 8 block it pocket dot com enhancing health and privacy.
[2:51:31.120 --> 2:51:36.120]  President Trump is cleaning up Washington, but the media and Barack Obama want to stop him.
[2:51:36.120 --> 2:51:38.120]  They've declared total war against him.
[2:51:38.120 --> 2:51:43.120]  Now David Horowitz is big agenda reveals Obama's secret plan to destroy Trump.
[2:51:43.120 --> 2:51:46.120]  Rush Limbaugh says you must read big agenda.
[2:51:46.120 --> 2:51:48.120]  Newsmax calls it the best Trump book yet.

[2:52:07.120 --> 2:52:14.120]  Disinfection chemicals like ammonia, chlorine and chloramines and pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds and antidepressants.
[2:52:14.120 --> 2:52:18.120]  They know water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.

[2:54:01.120 --> 2:54:19.120]  Monday through Friday 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central. We're here live. Back.
[2:54:19.120 --> 2:54:37.120]  Tonight, 7 o'clock Central in Full Wars Nightly News. I'm going to start the next hour and go right to Aaron, Dante, Lawrence, Ashley, Clark and others who said that there are folks of African descent here in the United States, Americans who have comments on SNL with, again,
[2:54:37.120 --> 2:54:41.120]  I can't even say what they say because they'll take it out and put it on the news.
[2:54:41.120 --> 2:54:53.120]  Next level lies. Next level, man. And it just shows how evil they are. I didn't even get to a lot of the news. I'm going to do like 20 minutes of calls in the next hour and then a little bit with David who's going to be co-hosting with me.
[2:54:53.120 --> 2:55:01.120]  Because I didn't get to show how the Islamists, the Turks are now trying to manipulate politics inside Europe, trying to organize mass movements.
[2:55:01.120 --> 2:55:13.120]  They claim to get people to affect EU policy towards Turkey and also votes in Turkey. But really it's mobilizing the Islamic force they brought in. And the leftists are now turning against it, finally getting that they're in trouble.
[2:55:13.120 --> 2:55:27.120]  What's wrong with you people? That's what I mean. I mean, look, if North Africa is so great or if Pakistan or Afghanistan is so great, go live there. But you don't know.
[2:55:27.120 --> 2:55:37.120]  I don't care whether you're black or white. The average person here is spoiled. Sure, you don't live like the Kardashians. Who wants to?
[2:55:37.120 --> 2:55:46.120]  One time I got a nicer house. I moved out of it a year later. I couldn't stand it. What even that big? But I want something little. All you do is live in your bedroom in your kitchen anyways.
[2:55:46.120 --> 2:56:00.120]  What you need is to keep all your crap. Give it away to sell it on eBay. I'm trying to convince my family to move into like a little farmhouse right now. I'm telling you. Screened in porch. I can sleep on. I just touched.
[2:56:00.120 --> 2:56:07.120]  The point is they just try to make everybody feel inadequate because we're not superstars in MSM. Those people have hellish lives.
[2:56:07.120 --> 2:56:18.120]  Gert Wilder is about to win the presidency there in the Netherlands, says expelled Turkish ambassador from the Netherlands. Yeah. Coming there, ordering them around. I mean, it's just getting crazy, man.
[2:56:18.120 --> 2:56:24.120]  So I'm going to go to your phone calls. I'm going to hit a lot of other important news. I never got to...
[2:56:24.120 --> 2:56:39.120]  Sean Spicer in an Apple store and a woman just screaming and yelling at him that he's bad and he's a Russian agent. Then you go to her website. She's an Indian American who says she hates white people and white people are bad. By the way, most Indians I know are smartest, most hardworking people and statistically the richest people in the United States.
[2:56:39.120 --> 2:56:51.120]  Oh, Paul has a whole article breaking that down. Well, the actual demographic, she's saying you white people are making us poor on the video. The average white person makes $26,000. The average Indian, $110,000.
[2:56:51.120 --> 2:57:04.120]  Indian Americans are the richest people in America per capita. And by the way, I get mobbed by Indian Americans everywhere. They just love Trump. They just love him. Oh, yeah.
[2:57:04.120 --> 2:57:21.120]  But again, everything's a lie. I saw the Soros funded anti-Alex Jones video the other day and they had Sikhs on it, burning Info Wars magazines. And then saying, because they're anti-Muslim, see, that's a little Soros desecration. The Sikhs have been one of the only groups to keep.
[2:57:21.120 --> 2:57:31.120]  140 million Indians have certainly been killed by Muslims the last thousand years. 140 million plus. And the Sikhs finally basically got formed to fight that.
[2:57:31.120 --> 2:57:45.120]  And so that's what their whole thing is about fighting Muslims. And so they turn around that the Sikhs want open borders and want to be Muslims. I mean, the stuff they rained down, the baloney they rained down is the greatest I've ever seen in my life.
[2:57:45.120 --> 2:57:54.120]  I want to come back and write to your phone calls before I go any further. We got to fund the operation. We've got the great anti-fungus, anti-yeast kills Candida, you name it.
[2:57:54.120 --> 2:58:03.120]  This is a new formula by Dr. Group. This new formula is amazing. Mycozx is about to sell out when the show ends. We've only down to a few thousand bottles of this. It's sold out a lot. We'll have more for six weeks.
[2:58:03.120 --> 2:58:15.120]  I'm going to have the price to retail in about 10 minutes. Infowarstore.com, Infowar'slife.com, our triple A, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine. That 30% off the micro straws. The Life Straws is great for you, name it.

[2:58:40.120 --> 2:58:50.120]  Free shipping storewide ends tomorrow. Forgot to add that. Don't be dead, folks. Wake up getting all the fight. Don't join the globalist minions. We are the living.

[3:00:10.120 --> 3:00:20.120]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[3:00:20.120 --> 3:00:30.120]  Yeah, we're under massive globalist censorship and attack and demonization right now. The likes of which have never been seen on Earth.
[3:00:30.120 --> 3:00:40.120]  Trump's under the greatest media attack on Earth, and no one's attacked more than me except Trump.
[3:00:40.120 --> 3:00:50.120]  Nothing like it. And I don't know what to say at this point, but I just told the crew, I only grow tentacles when I'm under attack.
[3:00:50.120 --> 3:00:59.120]  And everything we do once we're under attack, every new ding we raunch, everything we do is very successful. Thanks to God.
[3:00:59.120 --> 3:01:06.120]  And I've got a bunch of ideas I've been mulling around for years that are all now just ready to crystallize with some big things.
[3:01:06.120 --> 3:01:13.120]  So pray for us, stay with us. All right, I wanted to give folks a chance that are African American, black, whatever.
[3:01:13.120 --> 3:01:20.120]  I hate this term, just Americans, but of African descent to call in and I'm not going to recap it all.
[3:01:20.120 --> 3:01:26.120]  But man, Saturday Night Live just had their Alec Baldwin playing Trump going, black people aren't humans.
[3:01:26.120 --> 3:01:30.120]  They're aliens. You can't trust them. And then I didn't say that they're going to clip that up on the news.
[3:01:30.120 --> 3:01:32.120]  That was Alec Baldwin saying that Trump said that.
[3:01:32.120 --> 3:01:36.120]  And he goes, well, where'd you learn that? Alec Jones, very credible, very credible.
[3:01:36.120 --> 3:01:43.120]  And then they have this homeland show saying, I hate the troops and I put out fake news and that Trump saw this. It's everywhere.
[3:01:43.120 --> 3:01:48.120]  So I just wanted to say, what is it like to see this? Because who buys this stuff?
[3:01:48.120 --> 3:01:54.120]  But some people think if they see it on Homeland or Saturday Night Live, it must be true because it's not just entertainment, folks.
[3:01:54.120 --> 3:01:59.120]  They admit they're doing this on purpose. So what does Clark and Ashley and Lawrence and Dante and Aaron and others think?
[3:01:59.120 --> 3:02:06.120]  So if somebody hangs up, you can call in 800. I suppose we're here from, you know, black Americans, 800-25-99-231.
[3:02:06.120 --> 3:02:10.120]  So let's go to California first. Let's go to Dante.
[3:02:10.120 --> 3:02:12.120]  Welcome to the airwaves.
[3:02:12.120 --> 3:02:14.120]  Hi, Alex.
[3:02:14.120 --> 3:02:16.120]  Thank you, sir, for calling in.
[3:02:16.120 --> 3:02:22.120]  No, you're welcome. So this is how I feel, man. It's like we need to stop the burners to ourselves as white as to black.
[3:02:22.120 --> 3:02:25.120]  And like you just said, we just need to refer to ourselves as Americans.
[3:02:25.120 --> 3:02:29.120]  We just simply just come together on the idea and the reality that we are Americans.
[3:02:29.120 --> 3:02:33.120]  You don't hear Chinese people walking around calling themselves yellow, do you?
[3:02:33.120 --> 3:02:36.120]  No, because they have a sense of nationality. They have a sense of pride in their nation.
[3:02:36.120 --> 3:02:41.120]  And we didn't have that. We had that ripped from us. We had a sense of nationality taken away from us.
[3:02:41.120 --> 3:02:44.120]  They want us to be racist rather than nationalist.
[3:02:44.120 --> 3:02:49.120]  I totally agree. And look, I'm not just saying this. It's almost discriminatory, but it's like real affirmative action,
[3:02:49.120 --> 3:02:56.120]  because Bass Books has been done to black people. Trump's actually really with the jobs, the incentives, the 25 billion to black colleges.
[3:02:56.120 --> 3:03:00.120]  And that's like almost 10 times what Obama did. I mean, he really is trying to deliver.
[3:03:00.120 --> 3:03:03.120]  And then Snoop Dogg runs around saying, kill him.
[3:03:03.120 --> 3:03:08.120]  Yeah, they don't want us to understand the bill of rights and Constitution is what makes us Americans.
[3:03:08.120 --> 3:03:12.120]  Like Black Lives Matter movement. What is the crux of the whole movement? Police brutality, right?
[3:03:12.120 --> 3:03:16.120]  So what is the protection of police brutality through the Constitution?
[3:03:16.120 --> 3:03:20.120]  The Eighth Amendment. The right to not have your butt kicked by police, right?
[3:03:20.120 --> 3:03:23.120]  Cool and unusual punishment. Isn't that like the justice of it?
[3:03:23.120 --> 3:03:28.120]  And there are some bad police. Exactly. But the answer is, don't have a civil war over it.
[3:03:28.120 --> 3:03:36.120]  Yeah, you don't have, but that's the thing. You don't have Black Lives Matter movement having people go out and protest that police uphold the Eighth Amendment.
[3:03:36.120 --> 3:03:40.120]  Because you know what? That would actually mean that we could all uphold the Eighth Amendment.
[3:03:40.120 --> 3:03:45.120]  Black, white, Chinese, whatever, in this country, Americans could uphold the Eighth Amendment.
[3:03:45.120 --> 3:03:48.120]  But they don't want us to think like that. They want us to think only in terms of race.
[3:03:48.120 --> 3:03:55.120]  And so we always are divided. Exactly. So we can have our birthright of bill of rights, Constitution, private property.
[3:03:55.120 --> 3:04:00.120]  Even though it wasn't always acknowledged or fulfilled early on, we're now demanding and fulfilling it.
[3:04:00.120 --> 3:04:03.120]  And the system is trying to get rid of it because it does create real unity.
[3:04:03.120 --> 3:04:09.120]  I don't care whether you're Black or white or what. If you've got good food, good music, good literature, good medicine.
[3:04:09.120 --> 3:04:16.120]  If I Google who the best doctor is, because I'm looking to get my Achilles fix and one of the top daughters is in Dallas and this is Black,
[3:04:16.120 --> 3:04:20.120]  I'm thinking about going to him. He's got the best reviews. I don't care what color he is. I want the reviews.
[3:04:20.120 --> 3:04:25.120]  I want the best fix. I want my leg fixed by the best person.
[3:04:25.120 --> 3:04:30.120]  I mean, I listen to Jimmy Hendricks not because he's Black, because he's a great guitarist and a great singer.
[3:04:30.120 --> 3:04:33.120]  See what I'm saying? I think that's what you're saying, Dante.
[3:04:33.120 --> 3:04:39.120]  Well, she should do herself some t-shirts to say, hey, I'm not white. I'm American. I have a Black teacher say, I'm not Black.
[3:04:39.120 --> 3:04:44.120]  I'm American. Have everybody wearing these shirts so we can just get past this race idea and all join together.
[3:04:44.120 --> 3:04:49.120]  I agree. We should put out a red, white, blue shirt saying, I'm American. I'm not white. I'm not Black. I'm not Hispanic.
[3:04:49.120 --> 3:04:53.120]  I'm an American and I want the bill of rights. I want the birthright. I want it. I want it.
[3:04:53.120 --> 3:04:59.120]  America hasn't been perfect, folks, but the idea, the tyrants hated. Great points, Dante. We're called straight ahead.
[3:04:59.120 --> 3:05:04.120]  Well, folks, America is now offensive in America.
[3:05:04.120 --> 3:05:11.120]  At a high school basketball game in Des Moines, Iowa, the students from Valley High decided to have a USA themed crowd and war red, white, and blue.
[3:05:11.120 --> 3:05:18.120]  Despite winning the game, they lost in social justice as coaches and fans of the other team were offended by the patriotic attire.
[3:05:18.120 --> 3:05:24.120]  See, Des Moines North is said to have 66% minority enrollment compared to the 26% at Valley.
[3:05:24.120 --> 3:05:32.120]  As if saying one school as a majority minority isn't crazy enough, now they're saying it's offensive to wear red, white, and blue if you play against this school.
[3:05:32.120 --> 3:05:38.120]  The biggest issue was that there was a refugee on the North roster, but you'd think he would embrace the country that embraced him.
[3:05:38.120 --> 3:05:46.120]  This is a trend, as last year, Ramapo College vetoed an American themed barbecue hosted by college Republicans and college Democrats.
[3:05:46.120 --> 3:05:50.120]  So we can't even come together in patriotism under these liberals.
[3:05:50.120 --> 3:05:54.120]  What is wrong with these people? Next, they're going to want to remove the flag.
[3:05:54.120 --> 3:06:22.120]  This is Owen Schreuer for Infowars.com, proud to be an American.
[3:06:22.120 --> 3:06:30.120]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors, and we need to do everything we can to recapture them.
[3:06:30.120 --> 3:06:38.120]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal. You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[3:06:38.120 --> 3:06:46.120]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[3:06:46.120 --> 3:06:54.120]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[3:06:54.120 --> 3:07:02.120]  I know you're going to want to check out caveman ultimate paleo formula for yourself at InfowarsLive.com today.
[3:07:02.120 --> 3:07:06.120]  Let's go to Devin and Florida. Devin and Florida, you're on the air.
[3:07:06.120 --> 3:07:20.120]  Great. Hey, thank you so much. Listen, I have bought your product and I got to say they're amazing. Anyone who's on the fence, buy it, because I've got caveman, superman vitality, secret swell, vitamin interfusion.
[3:07:20.120 --> 3:07:22.120]  I've got the body armor.
[3:07:22.120 --> 3:07:27.120]  Wow, thank you. You're the type of listener that makes it all possible. Which pharmaceutical is your like best?
[3:07:27.120 --> 3:07:31.120]  I really like the vitamin mineral fusion to be honest. That's amazing.
[3:07:31.120 --> 3:07:36.120]  Really incredible. I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible. I haven't felt the week.
[3:07:36.120 --> 3:07:49.120]  My morning was fantastic and I love you guys. I love the Infowars Crew and I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it, you will love it.
[3:07:49.120 --> 3:07:51.120]  I'm telling you, I've never bought a bad product.
[3:07:51.120 --> 3:08:02.120]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfowarsLife.com. It's a win-win, InfowarsLife.com.
[3:08:21.120 --> 3:08:25.120]  In fact, this is the tip of the spear, baby.
[3:08:25.120 --> 3:08:33.120]  Worldwide, sovereignty is exploding. Prohuman movements are forming and expanding.
[3:08:33.120 --> 3:08:39.120]  Better turn me loose.
[3:08:39.120 --> 3:08:47.120]  A little bit better than I used to be because I'm alive. I'm alive. Not dead. Not dead yet.
[3:08:47.120 --> 3:08:53.120]  I want to do things that empower my species into the future so that my actions and my genetics will live forever with yours.
[3:08:53.120 --> 3:08:56.120]  It's a big contest.
[3:08:56.120 --> 3:09:02.120]  The globalists want a convention to be shoveled into your grave to roll over and decide the species has failed.
[3:09:02.120 --> 3:09:08.120]  Our species is amazing.
[3:09:08.120 --> 3:09:13.120]  David Knight is back and ready to go after a week plus off, well-deserved with his family.
[3:09:13.120 --> 3:09:17.120]  One of the hardest working guys here at Infowars in Florida.
[3:09:17.120 --> 3:09:22.120]  He's back in Austin, Texas, but I'm all wound up today so I'm probably going to have to co-host most of the hour with him.
[3:09:22.120 --> 3:09:29.120]  But you know what? Don't worry. Soon David is going to have his own show and other folks are here because there's just so much going on.
[3:09:29.120 --> 3:09:33.120]  We're going to have to probably go 24 hours down the road just because it has to be done.
[3:09:33.120 --> 3:09:39.120]  It's not something I even want to do. It's got to be done because so much is happening and live is the way to go.
[3:09:39.120 --> 3:09:43.120]  There's a lot of produced pieces and things that air at 7 or 8 o'clock at night.
[3:09:43.120 --> 3:09:48.120]  But for TV and everything, the affiliates, UHF, VHF cable, they're already starting to pick us up.
[3:09:48.120 --> 3:09:52.120]  But they want at least 12 hours a day. We're going to give them more.
[3:09:52.120 --> 3:09:57.120]  And so some stations have tested it out. Got a lot of viewership and support.
[3:09:57.120 --> 3:10:00.120]  So Infowars is ready to shed its skin yet again.
[3:10:00.120 --> 3:10:04.120]  And again, everybody else talks and I wish they weren't just talking. We don't talk.
[3:10:04.120 --> 3:10:09.120]  You notice, I tell you, in the next year, we're going to the next level and we will win the election and we will expand this.
[3:10:09.120 --> 3:10:12.120]  And then worldwide, there'll be patriot movements exploding in nationalism.
[3:10:12.120 --> 3:10:15.120]  And it's happening. And it's not that I'm being given some script.
[3:10:15.120 --> 3:10:22.120]  And then we're just saying it. We are creating the script, which is historical, which is destiny, which is will.
[3:10:22.120 --> 3:10:25.120]  Now we got callers calling in who happened again last call.
[3:10:25.120 --> 3:10:29.120]  I said, yeah, I'm just American. I happen to have dark skin of African descent.
[3:10:29.120 --> 3:10:34.120]  Talking about SNL saying, I'm this big racist with no, no proof.
[3:10:34.120 --> 3:10:40.120]  They just say, they have the, I've already talked about it, but they have Donald Trump up there, AKA Donald Trump.
[3:10:40.120 --> 3:10:44.120]  It's really Alec Baldwin saying, I don't worry about aliens attacking the earth.
[3:10:44.120 --> 3:10:47.120]  You know, it's black people. They're the aliens. And I learned that from Alex Jones.
[3:10:47.120 --> 3:10:54.120]  That was just one lie. And then, you know, the next night, it's the homeland on CBS funded showtime saying lies about me.
[3:10:54.120 --> 3:10:56.120]  And, you know, that I hate veterans and all this crap.
[3:10:56.120 --> 3:11:03.120]  I mean, this is a real push and then I need to be banned to the creating the moral support to ban us as the last three weeks was two weeks.
[3:11:03.120 --> 3:11:06.120]  Now three, we've seen more censorship than seven, eight years now.
[3:11:06.120 --> 3:11:11.120]  Last week, it was the last two weeks. I've seen more than the last five. It's, it's, it's bad.
[3:11:11.120 --> 3:11:16.120]  I mean, there, it seems like it's incremental, but in the space of time, they're, they're cutting our head off right now.
[3:11:16.120 --> 3:11:25.120]  At least they're trying. We're on over 200 affiliates. We're huge all over the place, but they're really trying to get the areas where we reach people in the political commons because we're so dominant.
[3:11:25.120 --> 3:11:31.120]  So spread those videos more than ever. Call it kiddies video to fool their bots. And you can be Alex Jones.
[3:11:31.120 --> 3:11:36.120]  There's lots of tricks, but just know you give another chilling effect. They win. This is a war.
[3:11:36.120 --> 3:11:43.120]  Didn't about staying out of the fight. I want to go to these calls, but David, just pop in, you know, intercess all you want back and forth.
[3:11:43.120 --> 3:11:50.120]  These callers. I'm going to them. Clark and Ashley and Nicole and mankind and others here in just about a minute or two.
[3:11:50.120 --> 3:11:55.120]  But what do you make of the unparalleled attacks? Clearly we've got the system scared.
[3:11:55.120 --> 3:12:07.120]  You know, Alex, when they started talking about the black people being aliens, I think there was something very clever subliminally about that because you know, black people are really taking the brunt of these open borders.
[3:12:07.120 --> 3:12:14.120]  We have illegal aliens come in here and they say, oh, you're so astute. I missed that. I meant to make that point. Exactly.
[3:12:14.120 --> 3:12:22.120]  They're the ones who are the most pissed about the third world populations that understand what Trump's doing. So they're trying to have Trump call them aliens at that level. Genius night.
[3:12:22.120 --> 3:12:29.120]  Go ahead. Exactly. And what we see this weekend breaking throughout Europe, we have all these Turkish citizens.
[3:12:29.120 --> 3:12:34.120]  That's what we need to understand. Instead of even undocumented immigrants, nonsense, illegal aliens.
[3:12:34.120 --> 3:12:40.120]  It's a Turkish colonization force being activated by your gun for the takeover Europe. That's now happening right now.
[3:12:40.120 --> 3:12:47.120]  Right. When we look at the language that they use, they like to use these terms. They changed illegal aliens to undocumented immigrants.
[3:12:47.120 --> 3:12:57.120]  But really what they are are foreign citizens who are here illegally. And what we see happening in Europe now is we've got people from the Turkish administration because they've got an upcoming election.
[3:12:57.120 --> 3:13:04.120]  Going through and campaigning in all these European countries and they shut that down in the Netherlands that created massive riots.
[3:13:04.120 --> 3:13:12.120]  It's not a free immigration zone. People in Turkey don't have the ability to freely immigrate into the Xinjiang zone.
[3:13:12.120 --> 3:13:19.120]  The open citizenship within the EU. They were concerned that was going to be a mass influx of people from Turkey.
[3:13:19.120 --> 3:13:33.120]  Let's be clear. That's the MSM cover. If you read deeper, Europe understands, airgun is activating political forces for political power with the illegals he's brought in using these political rallies as the cover
[3:13:33.120 --> 3:13:38.120]  to get everybody documented on the database for mobilization. That's what Muslims do.
[3:13:38.120 --> 3:13:40.120]  Exactly. But I think it makes it really clear.
[3:13:40.120 --> 3:13:48.120]  And they're so arrogant in Germany and the Netherlands going, it's our country and we'll rape your women. Screw you. You're animals. You're kafers.
[3:13:48.120 --> 3:13:54.120]  Same thing. Like they have that movie, Lethal Weapon, where the race to South African calls the black people kafer, which is a racist term.
[3:13:54.120 --> 3:14:04.120]  That's a Muslim term, not just for Africans, but anybody they were enslaving. If they were enslaving Africans or Spanish or Italians, they would call them kafers.
[3:14:04.120 --> 3:14:12.120]  And I'm just sorry. Islam is an expansionist slave religion enslaving everyone. I mean, they have slavery now.
[3:14:12.120 --> 3:14:15.120]  Exactly. And that's what's so crazy. Go ahead. Sorry.
[3:14:15.120 --> 3:14:22.120]  When we look at what's happening here, they're going into these different countries to campaign for the Turkish citizens who are living there.
[3:14:22.120 --> 3:14:29.120]  For me, that underscores the essence of what this is. These are foreign citizens who are coming into the West illegally.
[3:14:29.120 --> 3:14:35.120]  Let's show some of those articles. I had a whole bunch here in my stack. It's like airgun threatens Europe, calls them Nazis.
[3:14:35.120 --> 3:14:43.120]  You know, all this other incredible stuff over the fact that they dare say don't mobilize your millions of citizens inside our country into political groups.
[3:14:43.120 --> 3:14:54.120]  Right, right. When they talk about aliens, though, they're going back to like men in black where they made all the jokes about the aliens know and the parallels to illegal aliens coming into the country.
[3:14:54.120 --> 3:15:01.120]  But when we look at what's going on in Turkey, you really understand what we're talking about here is foreign citizens who are coming into our country like they are from Mexico.
[3:15:01.120 --> 3:15:06.120]  They're saying we're going to work with them with our embassies to help them subvert the American law.
[3:15:06.120 --> 3:15:14.120]  This is globalism. It's coming in and breaking up countries through this intramural warfare between nations. Absolutely, David. Let's go to these phone calls.
[3:15:14.120 --> 3:15:17.120]  David's going to break that down more. I'm glad you raised that because I intended to get to that.
[3:15:17.120 --> 3:15:24.120]  We also got Sean Spicer being confronted by a crazy lady from India saying he's racist and suppresses Indians when Indians are the richest people in the U.S.
[3:15:24.120 --> 3:15:29.120]  And by and large, incredibly low crime rate, incredible high production rate.
[3:15:29.120 --> 3:15:36.120]  And by the way, the majority of Indians in polls voted for Donald J. Trump. So it's kind of this anomaly of like a brainwash Indian woman.
[3:15:36.120 --> 3:15:40.120]  Lawrence in Virginia, you're on the air with David Knight. Go ahead.
[3:15:40.120 --> 3:15:44.120]  Thank you. Excuse me. Thank you. Thank you, sir.
[3:15:44.120 --> 3:15:51.120]  I want to say something about, oh, by the way, I pray for you and the family and the whole workforce team and their families every day.
[3:15:51.120 --> 3:15:54.120]  Well, thank you.
[3:15:54.120 --> 3:16:05.120]  I want to talk about that house we grow by named Snoop Dogg and also people like Samuel Jackson, Don Cheadle.
[3:16:05.120 --> 3:16:08.120]  All they are high-paid slaves.
[3:16:08.120 --> 3:16:16.120]  They're house slaves. They could pay a little more than us. They just moved better than us than the rest of us that have to work for a living.
[3:16:16.120 --> 3:16:22.120]  But if they don't tow the line, they'll have to go back to where we were doing before.
[3:16:22.120 --> 3:16:32.120]  And I don't appreciate the fact that they are trying to brainwash younger people who admire them into putting them on an electronic plantation,
[3:16:32.120 --> 3:16:37.120]  which is also known as the prison system.
[3:16:37.120 --> 3:16:38.120]  Absolutely.
[3:16:38.120 --> 3:16:43.120]  If you heard my rant last hour, jump in, David, but jump in anytime here, Lawrence. We're all free for all right now.
[3:16:43.120 --> 3:16:46.120]  I mean, do you agree with it? I mean, because I know Snoop knows what he's doing.
[3:16:46.120 --> 3:16:52.120]  He's saying kill Trump. Then he has an anti-gun rant, though, on top of it.
[3:16:52.120 --> 3:16:57.120]  And we're Snoop with all the black abortion. We're Snoop on the floor, right? We're Snoop.
[3:16:57.120 --> 3:17:00.120]  I mean, I'm not just saying this. If Trump was bad, I'd go after him.
[3:17:00.120 --> 3:17:03.120]  In fact, my ratings would be higher if I did. That's what, you know, but I'm not.
[3:17:03.120 --> 3:17:08.120]  I mean, Trump really is actually trying to empower all the communities, especially black communities.
[3:17:08.120 --> 3:17:13.120]  Stephen Bannon was a big liberal, big union guy grown up by liberals.
[3:17:13.120 --> 3:17:19.120]  He saw the control. He decided to go against it. Bannon's plan has been leaked, but it's also public.
[3:17:19.120 --> 3:17:26.120]  Totally, particularly, he's advised Trump to particularly flood black areas with scholarships, jobs, factories, tax incentives,
[3:17:26.120 --> 3:17:31.120]  knowing conservatives will actually go for that, not affirmative action because you get a job ahead of somebody
[3:17:31.120 --> 3:17:38.120]  just because you're a color, but create jobs in areas and then incentivize that and actually build people up.
[3:17:38.120 --> 3:17:44.120]  And that's why they're so pissed. Trump is really trying to get people off the plantation for real.
[3:17:44.120 --> 3:17:47.120]  And that's why they're so angry. What do you think, Lawrence?
[3:17:47.120 --> 3:17:54.120]  I agree completely. And not only like both Donald Trump and the prime, I voted for him in the election.
[3:17:54.120 --> 3:17:58.120]  In fact, I've never been more enthusiastic about any president's candidate.
[3:17:58.120 --> 3:18:02.120]  You know, I'm 60 years old. I've never been so enthusiastic about anybody.
[3:18:02.120 --> 3:18:06.120]  But let's go back to Snoop Dogg for a minute because he's very compromised.
[3:18:06.120 --> 3:18:12.120]  He's a crit from Long Beach, California. You know, he's been to the county jail, but he got in real trouble one time
[3:18:12.120 --> 3:18:20.120]  back when he was in part of Death Row Records, where he and two other people were involved with the shooting.
[3:18:20.120 --> 3:18:27.120]  Now, he didn't do the shooting, but in the state of California, unless they've changed the laws, I've lived in California before.
[3:18:27.120 --> 3:18:34.120]  If you were in a vehicle with somebody that shoots somebody and kills them, you would also charge
[3:18:34.120 --> 3:18:40.120]  with conspiracy to commit murder. So he was facing 20 years.
[3:18:40.120 --> 3:18:46.120]  The lawyer he had that was working for Death Row Records, I believe he was a prostitute.
[3:18:46.120 --> 3:18:48.120]  I can't think of his name off the top of my head.
[3:18:48.120 --> 3:18:50.120]  I remember the story, though. You're right.
[3:18:50.120 --> 3:18:57.120]  And he got off. Now, what do you think is the price to pay for that?
[3:18:57.120 --> 3:19:01.120]  I agree. And listen, I'm not trying to get you like sit there and say you better watch it.
[3:19:01.120 --> 3:19:06.120]  I've told I look bald in that. I've told everybody I've told these Washington Times reporters, Washington Post, not Washington Times,
[3:19:06.120 --> 3:19:09.120]  Washington Post, New York Times. They're constantly saying kill Trump.
[3:19:09.120 --> 3:19:14.120]  I mean, it's just like I get they want to make Trump move against him to say he's a dictator.
[3:19:14.120 --> 3:19:21.120]  But it's his certain point. Attorney General Sessions has to shut this down because if I was saying, which I wouldn't want to do,
[3:19:21.120 --> 3:19:23.120]  I mean, Obama was a puppet to so was Bush.
[3:19:23.120 --> 3:19:28.120]  If I was saying kill Obama, which I would never do, they would come arrest me.
[3:19:28.120 --> 3:19:33.120]  So I just don't get how they're trying to organize to kill Trump.
[3:19:33.120 --> 3:19:38.120]  And then all we've seen is the biggest small business numbers since 1984.
[3:19:38.120 --> 3:19:41.120]  It's just it's sick. It's sick. It's sick. It's sick.
[3:19:41.120 --> 3:19:45.120]  And the Snoop Dogg tries to, like you said, train all the kids to get induced into prison.
[3:19:45.120 --> 3:19:51.120]  It's other points, Lawrence. Go ahead. Sorry.
[3:19:51.120 --> 3:19:58.120]  I guess I think it's some point. And I guess the Democrats have nothing, nothing more.
[3:19:58.120 --> 3:20:04.120]  But but this this this cultural Marxism, Saul Linsky thing going that right now, right?
[3:20:04.120 --> 3:20:22.120]  They can't win as people, you show before they're finished. The only thing they can do is start violence, you know, start a riot and hope that the administration retaliates against him.
[3:20:22.120 --> 3:20:25.120]  They can say, look, here's the fascist now. But you know, at some point, this moves as a stop.
[3:20:25.120 --> 3:20:27.120]  Alex, can I jump in? That's a great point. Thank you, Lawrence.
[3:20:27.120 --> 3:20:34.120]  But at a certain point, as I'm saying, they're saying, kill me, kill Trump. They're putting words in our mouth. I mean, let me tell you, it freaks you out.
[3:20:34.120 --> 3:20:39.120]  When you see Alec Baldwin saying, Alex Jones told me black people aren't human.
[3:20:39.120 --> 3:20:45.120]  I mean, I mean, real fast back to Lawrence with no context, no history, no proof.
[3:20:45.120 --> 3:20:53.120]  I mean, you know, if they want to finally get to me, they're starting to get to me at that level. Lawrence, I mean, what do you think of that?
[3:20:53.120 --> 3:21:03.120]  I understand your frustration. You know, I watch it every day, right? And I can understand why you can't angry, you know?
[3:21:03.120 --> 3:21:13.120]  And we still have to keep doing what we're doing, you know, but Steve Pichanic is also right. I think they're finished.
[3:21:13.120 --> 3:21:18.120]  The only problem is what they're trying to start in the streets. And I think this song is going to be real hot.
[3:21:18.120 --> 3:21:24.120]  And we really have to use our brains instead of our emotions.
[3:21:24.120 --> 3:21:30.120]  That's right. And they're trying to wind up white supremacists right now to go blow something up. God, God, I pray that doesn't happen.
[3:21:30.120 --> 3:21:33.120]  They really want to race for it so bad. God bless you. I appreciate your call, Lawrence.
[3:21:33.120 --> 3:21:42.120]  We're all under globalist attack. We rise or fall together. And I got to tell you, I knew Trump was good, but I didn't know he'd be this good.
[3:21:42.120 --> 3:21:48.120]  And I guess things get so bad, though, that something good is going to happen.
[3:21:48.120 --> 3:21:51.120]  Sorry, Dan, you're trying to say something on erupts. You go ahead.
[3:21:51.120 --> 3:21:53.120]  I was just going to ask Lawrence. I don't think he's on the line.
[3:21:53.120 --> 3:21:59.120]  I was going to ask him. He made it an interesting point when you talked about the difference between house slaves and field slaves.
[3:21:59.120 --> 3:22:05.120]  And of course, we understand you go through the south or a lot of people who lived and worked with their masters in the house.
[3:22:05.120 --> 3:22:09.120]  They didn't have as hard of labor as the people in the fields did.
[3:22:09.120 --> 3:22:13.120]  And they didn't hate the system that much. They really kind of liked the system, many of them.
[3:22:13.120 --> 3:22:20.120]  And so when we look at what's coming, we need to understand that they want all of us on the plantation, not just black people.
[3:22:20.120 --> 3:22:27.120]  And if we look backwards and look at what they did to the Indians on the reservation, we see what's going to be coming in the future with Agenda 21.
[3:22:27.120 --> 3:22:31.120]  Like Churchill said, if we want to see the future more clearly, we look at the past.
[3:22:31.120 --> 3:22:35.120]  And so if we look at what they did with Indians on the reservations, shutting down.
[3:22:35.120 --> 3:22:40.120]  And by the way, Agenda 21 is putting humans on reservations to, quote, save the earth, but it has nothing to do with that.
[3:22:40.120 --> 3:22:42.120]  It's about total control.
[3:22:42.120 --> 3:22:43.120]  Exactly.
[3:22:43.120 --> 3:22:49.120]  And I know it's not like we're just demonizing their side. You cannot explain how bad they are.
[3:22:49.120 --> 3:22:54.120]  And Trump is literally trying to empower poor Americans, working class Americans.
[3:22:54.120 --> 3:22:59.120]  He wants prosperity. Bannon wants to break the back of collectivism. This is real.
[3:22:59.120 --> 3:23:01.120]  That's why the enemy's so pissed. Go ahead, David.
[3:23:01.120 --> 3:23:10.120]  If we look at what they're proposing now, we had some of these libertarian conservative economists during the Reagan administration talk about losing ground.
[3:23:10.120 --> 3:23:15.120]  Charles Murray, now they're going around with American Enterprise Institute, other places talking about a universal basic income.
[3:23:15.120 --> 3:23:23.120]  They were telling us 30 years ago we needed to reform welfare because it was making the inner city black community dependent on government.
[3:23:23.120 --> 3:23:30.120]  It was taking away their desire and their ability to be self-sufficient, just as we'd seen with the Indian reservations, of course.
[3:23:30.120 --> 3:23:36.120]  But now they're promoting the idea that we're going to have universal basic income because they want to take that away.
[3:23:36.120 --> 3:23:38.120]  They want to pacify the entire population.
[3:23:38.120 --> 3:23:41.120]  We need to understand that we have to hang together.
[3:23:41.120 --> 3:23:42.120]  We're going to hang separate.
[3:23:42.120 --> 3:23:43.120]  That's right. It just hit me.
[3:23:43.120 --> 3:23:48.120]  Just like they knew the company store at Sharecroppers, double charge.
[3:23:48.120 --> 3:23:50.120]  He ripped you off. It may all about that.
[3:23:50.120 --> 3:23:53.120]  Or they made it all about that they gave little coupons to or whatever.
[3:23:53.120 --> 3:24:02.120]  Same thing with the managers, the reservations, making it all about that little management to make you fight over who was in charge of the reservation,
[3:24:02.120 --> 3:24:05.120]  putting in a new nobility.
[3:24:05.120 --> 3:24:16.120]  But nobles had done that in Europe, manipulating France and Germany and England off of the nobility and fighting over the spoils instead of an open free culture.
[3:24:16.120 --> 3:24:20.120]  So exactly, David, that's all they're bringing back is the old feudal system.
[3:24:20.120 --> 3:24:30.120]  But I do see it as desperation, the fact that they've got all these TV shows with actors playing the part of me or Trump saying things we don't actually say.
[3:24:30.120 --> 3:24:38.120]  But then the media goes with that and says, oh, look, SNL takes aim at Alex Jones fake news.
[3:24:38.120 --> 3:24:44.120]  They go say things I never say and then say that I said it and that they took action.
[3:24:44.120 --> 3:24:45.120]  I mean, I don't think it's going to be successful.
[3:24:45.120 --> 3:24:46.120]  David, what do you think I'm going to call?
[3:24:46.120 --> 3:24:50.120]  I don't think so, but we see the same tactics used over and over again.
[3:24:50.120 --> 3:24:54.120]  First, divide people racially and then try to make alliances based on racialism.
[3:24:54.120 --> 3:24:57.120]  And that's what they were doing by saying that you were against these people.
[3:24:57.120 --> 3:25:07.120]  You were targeting them because they were black and calling them aliens and then getting them to self-identify with the people that have traditionally been called illegal aliens.
[3:25:07.120 --> 3:25:17.120]  That's a very clever subconscious technique that they're using for people to get them to switch and to ally and not to see themselves as individuals.
[3:25:17.120 --> 3:25:21.120]  And if we do that, we're not going to have a universal basic income.
[3:25:21.120 --> 3:25:23.120]  We're going to have universal basic slavery.
[3:25:23.120 --> 3:25:24.120]  We're all going to be sharecroppers.
[3:25:24.120 --> 3:25:26.120]  They want to drive down the ways as they said.
[3:25:26.120 --> 3:25:28.120]  They want to make us all poor.
[3:25:28.120 --> 3:25:30.120]  Folks, this is not our opinion.
[3:25:30.120 --> 3:25:33.120]  If you understand, 99% of this is all admitted.
[3:25:33.120 --> 3:25:40.120]  But what does it like for you then to watch a five-minute piece where every five seconds has a subliminal, an overt, a covert?
[3:25:40.120 --> 3:25:42.120]  All of it was a lie.
[3:25:42.120 --> 3:25:44.120]  All of it was a deception.
[3:25:44.120 --> 3:25:52.120]  Well, you know, Alex Solowinsky's Rules for Radicals, one of the key rules in that was that ridicule is the most effective weapon to destroy other people.
[3:25:52.120 --> 3:25:54.120]  And that's what Saturday Night Live has become.
[3:25:54.120 --> 3:25:57.120]  It's just become a propaganda vehicle.
[3:25:57.120 --> 3:25:59.120]  It's not funny.
[3:25:59.120 --> 3:26:00.120]  It's not funny at all.
[3:26:00.120 --> 3:26:01.120]  It's not well done.
[3:26:01.120 --> 3:26:08.120]  It's just stupid, but it is set up for the people who have been trained by watching a lot of television.
[3:26:08.120 --> 3:26:11.120]  They've been dumbed down and they're very susceptible to this.
[3:26:11.120 --> 3:26:13.120]  It is a very effective tool for brainwashing.
[3:26:13.120 --> 3:26:14.120]  This is for trans viewers.
[3:26:14.120 --> 3:26:16.120]  So let me ask you this question and we're going to call.
[3:26:16.120 --> 3:26:18.120]  What happens as these two paradigms shift?
[3:26:18.120 --> 3:26:20.120]  They admit two different realities.
[3:26:20.120 --> 3:26:23.120]  One based more on reality, one based on fraud and lies.
[3:26:23.120 --> 3:26:30.120]  What happens is that minority of people of every race, color, and creed, but a minority of Duke people get more intense in their brainwashing
[3:26:30.120 --> 3:26:35.120]  and more freaked out as we build the real world because that's the dichotomy, the paradox.
[3:26:35.120 --> 3:26:36.120]  Yeah.
[3:26:36.120 --> 3:26:43.120]  Well, the thing I see happening is we've got these two dystopian visions of the future that were given to us by Orwell and by Huxley.
[3:26:43.120 --> 3:26:46.120]  We have 1984 and we have Brave New World.
[3:26:46.120 --> 3:26:48.120]  We see the people who are watching Saturday Night Live.
[3:26:48.120 --> 3:26:50.120]  They're really the Brave New World population.
[3:26:50.120 --> 3:26:52.120]  That's the vast majority of the population.
[3:26:52.120 --> 3:26:57.120]  They can be easily entertained and subverted by sexual hedonism.
[3:26:57.120 --> 3:26:59.120]  They'll be hit with brainwashing, drugs.
[3:26:59.120 --> 3:27:00.120]  Yeah.
[3:27:00.120 --> 3:27:01.120]  They'll be hit with a 1984.
[3:27:01.120 --> 3:27:02.120]  Exactly.
[3:27:02.120 --> 3:27:03.120]  Exactly.
[3:27:03.120 --> 3:27:04.120]  And that's the other thing, Alex.
[3:27:04.120 --> 3:27:15.120]  When I was gone, I tried to take a vacation from the news, but I couldn't help but comment on Vault 7 because it was so vindicating for many of the things that we've said.
[3:27:15.120 --> 3:27:18.120]  And I hope that it will become part of the public dialogue.
[3:27:18.120 --> 3:27:24.120]  But then I come back this week and I see McCain and I see Politico and CNN saying,
[3:27:24.120 --> 3:27:25.120]  Change the subject.
[3:27:25.120 --> 3:27:28.120]  Prove that you were being surveilled, Trump.
[3:27:28.120 --> 3:27:31.120]  Well, we know that they're surveilling everybody about everything.
[3:27:31.120 --> 3:27:33.120]  And the New York Times said they were wiretapping Trump.
[3:27:33.120 --> 3:27:35.120]  I have the headline right here.
[3:27:35.120 --> 3:27:36.120]  Exactly.
[3:27:36.120 --> 3:27:37.120]  We know that they're listening to everybody.
[3:27:37.120 --> 3:27:39.120]  They're using all this stuff and then they pretend,
[3:27:39.120 --> 3:27:40.120]  Well, that didn't happen.
[3:27:40.120 --> 3:27:41.120]  You need to prove that to us.
[3:27:41.120 --> 3:27:44.120]  And of course, people like Michael Hayden out there saying,
[3:27:44.120 --> 3:27:46.120]  This is all fake news.
[3:27:46.120 --> 3:27:49.120]  It's an illegitimate, non-fact based worldview that's being sold out there.
[3:27:49.120 --> 3:27:53.120]  And if Donald Trump wants to know if he was being surveilled, just ask them.
[3:27:53.120 --> 3:27:57.120]  Well, what about when Ron Whiting asked James Clapper and James Clapper.
[3:27:57.120 --> 3:27:59.120]  Let me ask you this and I got to go calls.
[3:27:59.120 --> 3:28:00.120]  Look into the eye when he's lying.
[3:28:00.120 --> 3:28:03.120]  So I've got to get through these and hand it over to you.
[3:28:03.120 --> 3:28:05.120]  At what point do we not respond to them?
[3:28:05.120 --> 3:28:07.120]  Because their audience is smaller than ours overall.
[3:28:07.120 --> 3:28:11.120]  Because I still respond to it, but their only power now is to put out outrageous lies
[3:28:11.120 --> 3:28:13.120]  and have us respond, it seems.
[3:28:13.120 --> 3:28:14.120]  Well, true.
[3:28:14.120 --> 3:28:16.120]  But, you know, we have always done analysis.
[3:28:16.120 --> 3:28:20.120]  And I think we always will need to say, look at what they're saying.
[3:28:20.120 --> 3:28:21.120]  And here's what is true.
[3:28:21.120 --> 3:28:22.120]  We need to do that.
[3:28:22.120 --> 3:28:23.120]  And we're doing that.
[3:28:23.120 --> 3:28:24.120]  And it's not hard.
[3:28:24.120 --> 3:28:26.120]  I mean, I never said black people aren't humans.
[3:28:26.120 --> 3:28:27.120]  It's the opposite.
[3:28:27.120 --> 3:28:28.120]  Yeah.
[3:28:28.120 --> 3:28:31.120]  I mean, it's like crazy to have Alec Baldwin playing the president saying, I heard from
[3:28:31.120 --> 3:28:33.120]  Alex Jones, black people aren't human.
[3:28:33.120 --> 3:28:37.120]  That is an outrageous lie, an outrageous insult to the viewers.
[3:28:37.120 --> 3:28:40.120]  Well, I think it's very important for us to deconstruct their comments.
[3:28:40.120 --> 3:28:42.120]  Just as we see Michael Hayden out here.
[3:28:42.120 --> 3:28:48.120]  He's going to go out and make blanket statements that are patently false, very generalized.
[3:28:48.120 --> 3:28:50.120]  He doesn't ever get into any specifics, mind you.
[3:28:50.120 --> 3:28:52.120]  But he puts out these generalized statements.
[3:28:52.120 --> 3:28:56.120]  This is a guy who said, I didn't need the Patriot Act.
[3:28:56.120 --> 3:29:00.120]  I didn't need section 123 or whatever it was to spy on people.
[3:29:00.120 --> 3:29:03.120]  I had a direct order from the president.
[3:29:03.120 --> 3:29:04.120]  That's called a dictatorship.
[3:29:04.120 --> 3:29:05.120]  Okay.
[3:29:05.120 --> 3:29:08.120]  So he wants to talk about a post fact based world.
[3:29:08.120 --> 3:29:12.120]  Let's talk about a post republic world where we don't have a republic anymore.
[3:29:12.120 --> 3:29:13.120]  Yeah.
[3:29:13.120 --> 3:29:14.120]  So the president wants to say it happened.
[3:29:14.120 --> 3:29:15.120]  It happened.
[3:29:15.120 --> 3:29:16.120]  Exactly.
[3:29:16.120 --> 3:29:17.120]  They want to play both sides.
[3:29:17.120 --> 3:29:18.120]  And the God to them was the state.
[3:29:18.120 --> 3:29:19.120]  The president was the head of that.
[3:29:19.120 --> 3:29:22.120]  That's why they're so freaked out that we seized a beach head.
[3:29:22.120 --> 3:29:32.120]  But notice David, they're still going ahead with their plans that Hillary's president with all these made for TV movies about a female president and all these shows and books about Chelsea running a world government with Bill Gates.
[3:29:32.120 --> 3:29:37.120]  They're still going ahead with the censorship agenda, even though they lost that.
[3:29:37.120 --> 3:29:39.120]  That's what's crazy is like a giant boat.
[3:29:39.120 --> 3:29:40.120]  They can't turn it around.
[3:29:40.120 --> 3:29:42.120]  So they're still running their agenda.
[3:29:42.120 --> 3:29:47.120]  Even though it's blowing up, we're going to come back, take five more calls and I'm turning it over to David Knight.
[3:29:47.120 --> 3:29:50.120]  We got the Sean Spicer clip coming up as well.
[3:29:50.120 --> 3:29:52.120]  We're on the March.
[3:29:52.120 --> 3:29:54.120]  The Empire's on the run.
[3:29:54.120 --> 3:30:01.120]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:30:01.120 --> 3:30:05.120]  Well folks, America is now offensive in America.
[3:30:05.120 --> 3:30:12.120]  At a high school basketball game in Des Moines, Iowa, the students from Valley High decided to have a USA themed crowd and war red, white and blue.
[3:30:12.120 --> 3:30:19.120]  Despite winning the game, they lost in social justice as coaches and fans of the other team were offended by the patriotic attire.
[3:30:19.120 --> 3:30:24.120]  See Des Moines North is said to have 66% minority enrollment compared to the 26% at Valley.
[3:30:24.120 --> 3:30:32.120]  As if saying one school as a majority minority isn't crazy enough, now they're saying it's offensive to wear red, white and blue if you play against this school.
[3:30:32.120 --> 3:30:38.120]  The biggest issue was that there was a refugee on the North roster, but you'd think he would embrace the country that embraced him.
[3:30:38.120 --> 3:30:46.120]  This is a trend as last year, Ramapo College vetoed an American themed barbecue hosted by college Republicans and college Democrats.
[3:30:46.120 --> 3:30:50.120]  So we can't even come together in patriotism under these liberals.
[3:30:50.120 --> 3:30:52.120]  What is wrong with these people?
[3:30:52.120 --> 3:30:54.120]  Next they're going to want to remove the flag.
[3:30:54.120 --> 3:30:56.120]  This is Owen Schreuer for Infowars.com.

[3:33:15.120 --> 3:33:17.120]  Yeah, we're getting the new liners cut.
[3:33:17.120 --> 3:33:20.120]  So, when David Knight hosts, or Paul Watson hosts, you can hear their name introduced.
[3:33:20.120 --> 3:33:24.120]  We're planning to launch a lot of new live broadcasts soon just because there's so much happening.
[3:33:24.120 --> 3:33:26.120]  The fight is now. We've got to do it.
[3:33:26.120 --> 3:33:29.120]  That's the way to really get to all the news I'm not getting to.
[3:33:29.120 --> 3:33:32.120]  It's up on Infowars.com and PrismPlanet.com.
[3:33:32.120 --> 3:33:36.120]  I want to go to Mankind and Alicia and Clark and others who are just a second.
[3:33:36.120 --> 3:33:42.120]  David Knight's again co-hosting with me just back after a well-deserved week of vacation with his family.
[3:33:42.120 --> 3:33:48.120]  We are ending tomorrow free shipping, store-wide, whether it's water filtration, books, videos,
[3:33:48.120 --> 3:33:52.120]  $9.95, Trump Pins, 2020 shirts out of the Gates discount,
[3:33:52.120 --> 3:33:54.120]  because I want to make them go viral, spread the word.
[3:33:54.120 --> 3:33:57.120]  InfowarsStore.com, InfowarsLife.com.
[3:33:57.120 --> 3:33:59.120]  The MycoZX is available.
[3:33:59.120 --> 3:34:02.120]  You can also get it with the bottom defense probiotic.
[3:34:02.120 --> 3:34:05.120]  This cuts out the fungus and the mold, something that the probiotic doesn't.
[3:34:05.120 --> 3:34:07.120]  It just displaces the bad bacteria.
[3:34:07.120 --> 3:34:10.120]  They go together, talk about life-changing, and you also support the broadcast.
[3:34:10.120 --> 3:34:14.120]  That's available at InfowarsStore.com, and you know you can't lose

[3:34:57.120 --> 3:35:00.120]  I've got a few other things I'm going to hit with David Knight.
[3:35:00.120 --> 3:35:03.120]  Let's go ahead and go to Alicia in New York.
[3:35:03.120 --> 3:35:06.120]  Thanks for holding Alicia.
[3:35:06.120 --> 3:35:07.120]  Hi.
[3:35:07.120 --> 3:35:08.120]  Thank you for calling.
[3:35:08.120 --> 3:35:10.120]  Thank you for my call.
[3:35:10.120 --> 3:35:18.120]  Yeah, so I guess as far as the SNL skit, I mean, I think they're just trying to
[3:35:18.120 --> 3:35:23.120]  make those that are still asleep feel like there's a divide,
[3:35:23.120 --> 3:35:26.120]  or that there's, you know, black people aren't for Donald Trump.
[3:35:26.120 --> 3:35:30.120]  I think it really just like flows the mind of some people that, you know,
[3:35:30.120 --> 3:35:35.120]  there could be black Americans, African Americans who are actually supporting Trump.
[3:35:35.120 --> 3:35:36.120]  Exactly.
[3:35:36.120 --> 3:35:37.120]  I mean, it's just like I did with the Tea Party.
[3:35:37.120 --> 3:35:39.120]  That was a libertarian thing with Ron Paul.
[3:35:39.120 --> 3:35:40.120]  We were involved.
[3:35:40.120 --> 3:35:44.120]  Then they were protesting Republicans and Democrats 10 years ago, or nine years ago.
[3:35:44.120 --> 3:35:47.120]  So the media made it, oh, this racist group, minorities can't go to this.
[3:35:47.120 --> 3:35:51.120]  And it actually worked for a while, but Trump seemed to break through that.
[3:35:51.120 --> 3:35:54.120]  I went to Trump rallies for like half the people were quote minorities,
[3:35:54.120 --> 3:35:56.120]  who by the way are pretty much the majority.
[3:35:56.120 --> 3:35:57.120]  I don't care.
[3:35:57.120 --> 3:35:58.120]  It's about ideology.
[3:35:58.120 --> 3:35:59.120]  It's about what you think.
[3:35:59.120 --> 3:36:01.120]  It's about what you stand for, David.
[3:36:01.120 --> 3:36:04.120]  Yeah, Alex, I think it's very important for us to understand, as I said before,
[3:36:04.120 --> 3:36:08.120]  that this is a movement we've seen a lot of black people who are awake,
[3:36:08.120 --> 3:36:10.120]  a lot of black people who supported Donald Trump.
[3:36:10.120 --> 3:36:15.120]  He did much better than Mitt Romney or these other previous Republican candidates have done.
[3:36:15.120 --> 3:36:18.120]  And they understand that they have common interest with us.
[3:36:18.120 --> 3:36:20.120]  They understand that they're being displaced.
[3:36:20.120 --> 3:36:21.120]  They're losing their jobs.
[3:36:21.120 --> 3:36:23.120]  And that's the panic by the Democrats.
[3:36:23.120 --> 3:36:24.120]  Yes.
[3:36:24.120 --> 3:36:25.120]  Yes.
[3:36:25.120 --> 3:36:26.120]  Exactly.
[3:36:26.120 --> 3:36:31.120]  The Democrats have always ruled by divide and conquer demographically.
[3:36:31.120 --> 3:36:33.120]  And so that's something that they've recently done.
[3:36:33.120 --> 3:36:34.120]  They've flipped.
[3:36:34.120 --> 3:36:38.120]  And they're now trying to create this narrative where everybody needs to hang together
[3:36:38.120 --> 3:36:40.120]  against white people, for example.
[3:36:40.120 --> 3:36:44.120]  White people are privileged, except they are the ones who are privileged.
[3:36:44.120 --> 3:36:46.120]  They're the ones who are coming in and saying,
[3:36:46.120 --> 3:36:49.120]  we're going to dictate to you who's going to have a job,
[3:36:49.120 --> 3:36:52.120]  who's going to have a job, who's going to have a job,
[3:36:52.120 --> 3:36:55.120]  who's going to have a job, who's going to have a job.
[3:36:55.120 --> 3:36:56.120]  Who's going to have a job?
[3:36:56.120 --> 3:37:00.120]  We're going to tell these people who are foreign citizens from another country here illegally,
[3:37:00.120 --> 3:37:05.120]  we're going to give them rights and welfare and jobs and the ability to vote.
[3:37:05.120 --> 3:37:08.120]  They're replacing you while they claim they represent you.
[3:37:08.120 --> 3:37:09.120]  Exactly.
[3:37:09.120 --> 3:37:11.120]  That's why Obama completely abandoned black Americans.
[3:37:11.120 --> 3:37:12.120]  Sorry, Ashley.
[3:37:12.120 --> 3:37:14.120]  Go ahead and finish your point.
[3:37:14.120 --> 3:37:20.120]  Yeah, I just think that there's so panic that they don't care if they're being
[3:37:20.120 --> 3:37:25.120]  relevant or even making sense at this point.
[3:37:25.120 --> 3:37:28.120]  Back in the day, Saturday Night Live used to,
[3:37:28.120 --> 3:37:31.120]  they tried to be more kind of up to date with what was going on.
[3:37:31.120 --> 3:37:35.120]  And now I think it's just this very narrow space that they're staying in,
[3:37:35.120 --> 3:37:38.120]  as far as making fun of President Trump, how he speaks,
[3:37:38.120 --> 3:37:41.120]  who he looks like, and just holding on to his racist,
[3:37:41.120 --> 3:37:47.120]  his xenophobic, without even kind of understanding that there are other things
[3:37:47.120 --> 3:37:50.120]  going on that they could possibly...
[3:37:50.120 --> 3:37:52.120]  Exactly. Alicia, sorry I called you Ashley.
[3:37:52.120 --> 3:37:53.120]  Great points.
[3:37:53.120 --> 3:37:55.120]  Thank you so much for calling from New York.
[3:37:55.120 --> 3:38:00.120]  To me, imagine SNL has Alec Baldwin playing the president,
[3:38:00.120 --> 3:38:04.120]  and he says, black people aren't humans, Alex Jones told me so.
[3:38:04.120 --> 3:38:08.120]  Just imagine being the person when no one's ever claimed this,
[3:38:08.120 --> 3:38:11.120]  no one's got any evidence, and it just lets you know,
[3:38:11.120 --> 3:38:13.120]  and you're like, oh, well, it's entertainment.
[3:38:13.120 --> 3:38:14.120]  No, it's not.
[3:38:14.120 --> 3:38:15.120]  They do that on mainstream news now.
[3:38:15.120 --> 3:38:16.120]  It shows the desperation.
[3:38:16.120 --> 3:38:18.120]  David, I see this as a sign of desperation.
[3:38:18.120 --> 3:38:19.120]  I think they're panicking.
[3:38:19.120 --> 3:38:24.120]  Well, you know, Alex, broadcast media has been losing audience share left and right.
[3:38:24.120 --> 3:38:26.120]  There's a large landscape out there.
[3:38:26.120 --> 3:38:30.120]  They've divided the audience throughout all these cable channels and everything.
[3:38:30.120 --> 3:38:35.120]  So if NBC can go in and take their small niche audience,
[3:38:35.120 --> 3:38:39.120]  and they can coalesce it around an anti-Trump narrative,
[3:38:39.120 --> 3:38:41.120]  then they can shoot up a little bit in the ratings.
[3:38:41.120 --> 3:38:42.120]  And that's what they're trying to do.
[3:38:42.120 --> 3:38:44.120]  They're trying to create a niche audience there
[3:38:44.120 --> 3:38:46.120]  that they can rise in the ratings.
[3:38:46.120 --> 3:38:48.120]  It's not good entertainment.
[3:38:48.120 --> 3:38:50.120]  It's not going to help them a long term,
[3:38:50.120 --> 3:38:52.120]  but it will help them in the short term.
[3:38:52.120 --> 3:38:54.120]  And so that's why they're focusing on this.
[3:38:54.120 --> 3:38:57.120]  They don't have anything else other than
[3:38:57.120 --> 3:39:00.120]  Alec Baldwin doing his Donald Trump attacks.
[3:39:00.120 --> 3:39:01.120]  But let's be clear.
[3:39:01.120 --> 3:39:02.120]  It's not funny.
[3:39:02.120 --> 3:39:04.120]  They're coming out calling, and it's already happening on Facebook, Twitter,
[3:39:04.120 --> 3:39:06.120]  you name it, they're starting to censor info wars.
[3:39:06.120 --> 3:39:08.120]  So they obviously should know this is ongoing.
[3:39:08.120 --> 3:39:09.120]  They're censoring everybody else.
[3:39:09.120 --> 3:39:12.120]  So this is their cover, putting out their fake news,
[3:39:12.120 --> 3:39:15.120]  having the new homeland Jake Weber guy do horrible things,
[3:39:15.120 --> 3:39:16.120]  the name of Alex Jones.
[3:39:16.120 --> 3:39:17.120]  It's like crazy.
[3:39:17.120 --> 3:39:19.120]  Like you have fiction shows.
[3:39:19.120 --> 3:39:21.120]  That's your proof that I need to be banned.
[3:39:21.120 --> 3:39:22.120]  Yeah.
[3:39:22.120 --> 3:39:24.120]  I mean, it's just like a science fiction movie.
[3:39:24.120 --> 3:39:28.120]  Who the hell could come up with this where actors play the part of you,
[3:39:28.120 --> 3:39:31.120]  do bad things, so then you need to be banned.
[3:39:31.120 --> 3:39:33.120]  And they call us fake.
[3:39:33.120 --> 3:39:37.120]  They go out and they create these dramas, these comedies,
[3:39:37.120 --> 3:39:39.120]  and they put people in these phony role models.
[3:39:39.120 --> 3:39:41.120]  I mean, it really is Orwellian, isn't it, Alex?
[3:39:41.120 --> 3:39:44.120]  I mean, it's absolutely incredible, but they put this stuff out there.
[3:39:44.120 --> 3:39:45.120]  I can't believe it.
[3:39:45.120 --> 3:39:46.120]  It's like, maybe this is a simulation.
[3:39:46.120 --> 3:39:48.120]  I'm like, baby rove, an action-adventure thing.
[3:39:48.120 --> 3:39:50.120]  Like, I'm actually the guy battling the new world order and the globalist
[3:39:50.120 --> 3:39:52.120]  and you are, and we're doing it.
[3:39:52.120 --> 3:39:53.120]  Maybe it's just a video game.
[3:39:53.120 --> 3:39:56.120]  I mean, I just, you know, it's just like, what the hell?
[3:39:56.120 --> 3:39:57.120]  And so many people are so bad.
[3:39:57.120 --> 3:39:59.120]  Like, they created this false universe where we're good guys
[3:39:59.120 --> 3:40:00.120]  and they're all bad.
[3:40:00.120 --> 3:40:03.120]  But the truth is, this is all real folks, and we're just crazy.
[3:40:03.120 --> 3:40:05.120]  When we come after them and we take a look and we say,
[3:40:05.120 --> 3:40:06.120]  look at what Michael Hayden said.
[3:40:06.120 --> 3:40:09.120]  Look at this clip that nobody else plays when it goes to Washington and Lee
[3:40:09.120 --> 3:40:11.120]  and says, I had a direct order from president.
[3:40:11.120 --> 3:40:12.120]  I didn't need a law.
[3:40:12.120 --> 3:40:13.120]  I didn't need a constitution.
[3:40:13.120 --> 3:40:18.120]  We look at that and yet they create these phony, stilted dramatizations
[3:40:18.120 --> 3:40:22.120]  that are supposed to be reality, but they really work on people in a subliminal way,
[3:40:22.120 --> 3:40:25.120]  try to adjust their subconscious and they do it.
[3:40:25.120 --> 3:40:26.120]  Sure, it's over as well.
[3:40:26.120 --> 3:40:27.120]  Drama, yeah.
[3:40:27.120 --> 3:40:29.120]  Since you say that, I want to play a few clips here and then go back to Clark
[3:40:29.120 --> 3:40:33.120]  and others that have been holding here, Nicole and mankind and others.
[3:40:33.120 --> 3:40:34.120]  We'll get to you at least here.
[3:40:34.120 --> 3:40:36.120]  I don't want David to not have a little bit at the end here.
[3:40:36.120 --> 3:40:39.120]  I've always had a lot of sabers been gone for a week.
[3:40:39.120 --> 3:40:44.120]  But here is a clip of Janet Reno in 1993 when they first get in,
[3:40:44.120 --> 3:40:47.120]  they fire 93 U.S. attorneys to carry out their operations.
[3:40:47.120 --> 3:40:49.120]  Now, Trump gets rid of 46.
[3:40:49.120 --> 3:40:51.120]  He tells them, just follow my agenda and the bill of rights.
[3:40:51.120 --> 3:40:52.120]  You can stay in.
[3:40:52.120 --> 3:40:53.120]  They don't do it.
[3:40:53.120 --> 3:40:54.120]  So he fires them.
[3:40:54.120 --> 3:40:55.120]  The media goes, it's outrageous.
[3:40:55.120 --> 3:40:56.120]  No one's ever done this.
[3:40:56.120 --> 3:40:58.120]  The way he did it, he just announced it.
[3:40:58.120 --> 3:40:59.120]  That's how you do it.
[3:40:59.120 --> 3:41:02.120]  It's been going on for 200 years that a new administration comes in
[3:41:02.120 --> 3:41:05.120]  and just fires the last group.
[3:41:05.120 --> 3:41:06.120]  But here it is.
[3:41:06.120 --> 3:41:08.120]  Here's Janet Reno.
[3:41:08.120 --> 3:41:14.120]  This is CBS News 1993 firing 93 of the 100 U.S. attorneys.
[3:41:14.120 --> 3:41:15.120]  Here it is.
[3:41:15.120 --> 3:41:21.120]  Janet Reno fired every holdover Republican U.S. attorney all across the country.
[3:41:21.120 --> 3:41:25.120]  I have asked for their resignations as a request to the president.
[3:41:25.120 --> 3:41:30.120]  All 93 U.S. attorneys, a one-day clean sweep.
[3:41:30.120 --> 3:41:36.120]  Presidents do replace the other party's appointees, but usually not wholesale.
[3:41:36.120 --> 3:41:44.120]  It's important that we build a team that reflects our desire to have a justice department
[3:41:44.120 --> 3:41:49.120]  marked by excellence, marked by diversity, marked by professionalism and integrity.
[3:41:49.120 --> 3:41:55.120]  I want teamwork where we're both interested in achieving justice throughout America.
[3:41:55.120 --> 3:41:57.120]  So there's a perfect example.
[3:41:57.120 --> 3:42:00.120]  I mean, there's headlines everywhere.
[3:42:00.120 --> 3:42:02.120]  I was in the last night here at the office watching a scene.
[3:42:02.120 --> 3:42:03.120]  It was like no one's ever done it.
[3:42:03.120 --> 3:42:04.120]  Chuck Schumer is outraged.
[3:42:04.120 --> 3:42:07.120]  Trump's getting rid of him because they were about to expose crimes.
[3:42:07.120 --> 3:42:09.120]  No one's ever fired.
[3:42:09.120 --> 3:42:12.120]  A week ago, they admitted people fire U.S. attorneys en masse, but they didn't do it right.
[3:42:12.120 --> 3:42:14.120]  Now it's just no one's ever done this.
[3:42:14.120 --> 3:42:17.120]  They act like we have no memory.
[3:42:17.120 --> 3:42:18.120]  You know what you're saying?
[3:42:18.120 --> 3:42:21.120]  Alex said it's not just that, but what is truly unprecedented.
[3:42:21.120 --> 3:42:22.120]  It's not the firing of people.
[3:42:22.120 --> 3:42:23.120]  You should just point out.
[3:42:23.120 --> 3:42:28.120]  Trump has let go half the number of people that Janet Reno and Bill Clinton fired.
[3:42:28.120 --> 3:42:33.120]  But it's the fact that they are now coalescing in an opposition format,
[3:42:33.120 --> 3:42:36.120]  like Obama started doing even before Trump became president.
[3:42:36.120 --> 3:42:38.120]  He said, I'm going to stay in Washington.
[3:42:38.120 --> 3:42:39.120]  I'm going to work with Eric Holder.
[3:42:39.120 --> 3:42:43.120]  We're going to sue at the state level to try to get at the...
[3:42:43.120 --> 3:42:46.120]  He said Obama is coming, messianic.
[3:42:46.120 --> 3:42:47.120]  Exactly.
[3:42:47.120 --> 3:42:49.120]  That's what's really different.
[3:42:49.120 --> 3:42:51.120]  And they're not talking about that very much.
[3:42:51.120 --> 3:42:56.120]  We have a story here from Reuters where it says Obama lawyers move fast to join the fight against Trump.
[3:42:56.120 --> 3:43:02.120]  And there they talk about some lawyers, one in particular, who resigns from his position just before inauguration day.
[3:43:02.120 --> 3:43:06.120]  Then he gets into some opposition work and so forth and so on.
[3:43:06.120 --> 3:43:10.120]  They said, what is unusual is how fast these people have signed up to be Trump adversaries.
[3:43:10.120 --> 3:43:15.120]  That really is what's unusual, the fact that they're not doing this in reaction to Donald Trump.
[3:43:15.120 --> 3:43:17.120]  But this is a preplanned opposition.
[3:43:17.120 --> 3:43:22.120]  And let's be clear, they're using their moles that are still in the Justice Department to communicate back with them.
[3:43:22.120 --> 3:43:24.120]  They all need to be fired, all of them.
[3:43:24.120 --> 3:43:28.120]  I want to see hundreds of thousands of firings, not 46.
[3:43:28.120 --> 3:43:39.120]  And we have never seen a president who left office remain in Washington to oppose as another government to oppose the new administration.
[3:43:39.120 --> 3:43:43.120]  That's because we never had somebody in modern history that's actually an American patriot and scared the elite so much.
[3:43:43.120 --> 3:43:44.120]  That's right.
[3:43:44.120 --> 3:43:46.120]  Folks, you're seeing legend right now.
[3:43:46.120 --> 3:43:48.120]  I'm Alex Jones, David Nines co-hosting.
[3:43:48.120 --> 3:43:49.120]  Let's go to California.
[3:43:49.120 --> 3:43:50.120]  Let's talk to Clark.
[3:43:50.120 --> 3:43:52.120]  Clark, you're on the air worldwide.
[3:43:52.120 --> 3:43:54.120]  Yes. Hey, Alex.
[3:43:54.120 --> 3:43:58.120]  First of all, I wanted to say I got this two phase point here.
[3:43:58.120 --> 3:44:10.120]  One is how does one get in contact with you directly in order to be able to be a contributor on the show and on a regular basis and be able to give some vital intel that could be very, very effective.
[3:44:10.120 --> 3:44:16.120]  Yeah, the showtipsinfoors.com were totally overwhelmed, understaffed, always just trying to even pay the bills.
[3:44:16.120 --> 3:44:20.120]  I'm not bitching, but we just spend all our time on that and other dirty tricks are going against us.
[3:44:20.120 --> 3:44:25.120]  But if people just want to go shoot their own things to their own videos, show their talent they've got, you know, with a camera.
[3:44:25.120 --> 3:44:30.120]  And like I did like, you know, 20-something years ago, a little, you know, used microphone I bought for like 50 bucks.
[3:44:30.120 --> 3:44:36.120]  I had a $200 camera and a $50 little used microphone, went out and shot reports that had a big effect.
[3:44:36.120 --> 3:44:39.120]  That's how I then got a local radio show and syndicated radio show and then the rest of it.
[3:44:39.120 --> 3:44:44.120]  But the biggest thing is just say out here is a citizen reporter for infowars.com.
[3:44:44.120 --> 3:44:49.120]  You know, you can say, you know, in an unofficial capacity for infowars, I'm following this report, put it out.
[3:44:49.120 --> 3:44:52.120]  If it's good, we'll start posting your material. If it's really great, we'll hire you.
[3:44:52.120 --> 3:44:55.120]  If the funds come in.
[3:44:55.120 --> 3:45:04.120]  And then the next thing is, I think it's good that we, you guys are giving people the intel to try to help people be relieved of what their agenda is.
[3:45:04.120 --> 3:45:09.120]  But I noticed that Donald Trump and them keep talking about the Bible and God and Christians.
[3:45:09.120 --> 3:45:11.120]  And I know you talk about that sometimes.
[3:45:11.120 --> 3:45:18.120]  I think the very serious point that needs to be looked at right here, this is adding up to a spiritual warfare.
[3:45:18.120 --> 3:45:27.120]  And I think sometimes when people start worrying about all the things that they're doing, there are prophecies in the Bible that give exactly what is going to happen.
[3:45:27.120 --> 3:45:29.120]  And that cannot be denied.
[3:45:29.120 --> 3:45:40.120]  So I think that when we start getting too worried, if you start to look into the scriptures and you see what's being said and what the prophecies is going to be, that global world...
[3:45:40.120 --> 3:45:50.120]  Absolutely. Trump knows when he talked about Jesus Christ and bringing God back and the covenant and the providence and the protection and the shield and the hedge,
[3:45:50.120 --> 3:45:59.120]  the enemy just went, and there were satanic events nationwide saying, killing, Satan is marching, we've gone out to events, they just show up, like, I love Satan.
[3:45:59.120 --> 3:46:02.120]  And it's like, they're really into this.
[3:46:02.120 --> 3:46:05.120]  And so then you realize, and we go to these events, I'm not kidding.
[3:46:05.120 --> 3:46:12.120]  They're like, they're like, what's wrong?
[3:46:12.120 --> 3:46:15.120]  And they're not even, they're going for like an hour.
[3:46:15.120 --> 3:46:17.120]  And they're like crawling the trash can.
[3:46:17.120 --> 3:46:22.120]  You know, it's like they are demons. I don't know what's going on, but they've taken on the archetype.
[3:46:22.120 --> 3:46:25.120]  They decided that's the team they're on.
[3:46:25.120 --> 3:46:30.120]  You know, whether you believe in a little mermaid or whatever, you can play the part of Ursula or a little mermaid, they decided the side of Ursula.
[3:46:30.120 --> 3:46:33.120]  You know, they're deciding to be evil. They're deciding to be bad.
[3:46:33.120 --> 3:46:35.120]  And I totally agree with you, Clark. Talk about it.
[3:46:35.120 --> 3:46:38.120]  I mean, you know, spiritual battle, absolutely. What do you think's going on there?
[3:46:38.120 --> 3:46:48.120]  Alex, look, one of the things that's going on is that there was a decree by God that no nation, no world power would rule 4,000 years.
[3:46:48.120 --> 3:46:53.120]  Great Britain started with the Anglo-Saxon world power.
[3:46:53.120 --> 3:47:00.120]  They've transferred it over to the United States, and now they're trying to transfer it over to the United Nations.
[3:47:00.120 --> 3:47:04.120]  They're trying to circumvent the decree that God has done.
[3:47:04.120 --> 3:47:11.120]  So they're not going to, they're not going to be able to do that, but they are going to be able to accomplish their global.
[3:47:11.120 --> 3:47:17.120]  No, you're right. William the Conqueror was 1100, and that's what they, they're actually into all this British, Israeliism, all of it.
[3:47:17.120 --> 3:47:19.120]  They think it's about to end. You're right about that.
[3:47:19.120 --> 3:47:25.120]  So it is prophecy, but the problem is at the end of their prophecy, it will collapse.
[3:47:25.120 --> 3:47:35.120]  So my thing is, don't get, when it comes to the point of civil war, because Henry Kissinger is on record quoting that there is going to be a civil war.
[3:47:35.120 --> 3:47:37.120]  He says we're going to put you in trips to Los Angeles.
[3:47:37.120 --> 3:47:43.120]  Yes, it's coming. So if that's the case, when it gets to that point, people have to preserve themselves.
[3:47:43.120 --> 3:47:45.120]  Don't get in that part of the fight.
[3:47:45.120 --> 3:47:52.120]  And with Donald Trump, I say this, you got to find a way to try to preserve this man who's trying to give relief to the people,
[3:47:52.120 --> 3:47:55.120]  because they're going to try to, he's surrounded by enemies.
[3:47:55.120 --> 3:47:58.120]  Oh, I agree. I mean, look, the Bible says that history shows it.
[3:47:58.120 --> 3:48:00.120]  Trump isn't perfect. He's a messenger.
[3:48:00.120 --> 3:48:04.120]  He's a final warning because God always gives us a chance not to go down the wrong road.
[3:48:04.120 --> 3:48:08.120]  He's a final warning to turn back.
[3:48:08.120 --> 3:48:13.120]  Yeah. So when it gets to that point, people have to preserve themselves and watch.
[3:48:13.120 --> 3:48:15.120]  You want to make it to the big dance.
[3:48:15.120 --> 3:48:18.120]  The big dance is the, is the war of Armageddon.
[3:48:18.120 --> 3:48:22.120]  That is a spiritual warfare and that's where they will fall apart.
[3:48:22.120 --> 3:48:25.120]  And we don't have to be sitting here getting all worried about it.
[3:48:25.120 --> 3:48:30.120]  But keep, we got to keep, you got to keep doing what you're doing is educate the people, preserve the people,
[3:48:30.120 --> 3:48:33.120]  because they're poisoning the food, the air, the water.
[3:48:33.120 --> 3:48:37.120]  The key is souls and minds. People being free is what matters in their mind.
[3:48:37.120 --> 3:48:41.120]  I mean, it's healthy as possible to move forward. You're exactly right.
[3:48:41.120 --> 3:48:42.120]  Well, yeah.
[3:48:42.120 --> 3:48:45.120]  Like I said, I would love to come back on the show and give you intel of things.
[3:48:45.120 --> 3:48:50.120]  Please do, sir. Just start filing and saying, Hey, you know, start saying this is Clark, California,
[3:48:50.120 --> 3:48:54.120]  giving intel to him for wars. And we'll start posting it. God bless you. Just do it.
[3:48:54.120 --> 3:48:56.120]  David comments on what he was just saying.
[3:48:56.120 --> 3:49:01.120]  Yeah, Alex, if we're going to make America great again, we've got to understand we've got to make America godly again.
[3:49:01.120 --> 3:49:04.120]  And that's not the job of government. It's not the job of Donald Trump.
[3:49:04.120 --> 3:49:08.120]  He may be there as a Cyrus to help us to give us another chance.
[3:49:08.120 --> 3:49:12.120]  But yeah, we really need to understand that America needs a spiritual revival.
[3:49:12.120 --> 3:49:17.120]  We look at the dumbed down vulgarism that we have in this country and it's not morality.
[3:49:17.120 --> 3:49:20.120]  It's morality flows from restored relationships.
[3:49:20.120 --> 3:49:25.120]  So instead of seeking people as the churches are doing now, they need to be seeking God on their knees.
[3:49:25.120 --> 3:49:31.120]  And if they do that, if there is a real revival, then these other things are going to flow from it.
[3:49:31.120 --> 3:49:33.120]  They'll turn the father's hearts to their children.
[3:49:33.120 --> 3:49:36.120]  It'll turn them looking to God, looking to the future.
[3:49:36.120 --> 3:49:37.120]  That has to come from God.
[3:49:37.120 --> 3:49:43.120]  And we have to seek that from God instead of seeking it from approval of men and creating these silly little programs.
[3:49:43.120 --> 3:49:45.120]  But that's so true and it's in the scripture.
[3:49:45.120 --> 3:49:47.120]  Being close to God means you see the big continuum.
[3:49:47.120 --> 3:49:49.120]  Care about yourself now, but care about others to come.
[3:49:49.120 --> 3:49:51.120]  That big continuum, the future.
[3:49:51.120 --> 3:49:54.120]  These wicked only look now about their own little personal power.
[3:49:54.120 --> 3:49:59.120]  And they're so blind and so little because they didn't join with the great continuum.
[3:49:59.120 --> 3:50:01.120]  The globalists claim they're collectivists or the opposite.
[3:50:01.120 --> 3:50:08.120]  These Luciferians are me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, I'm in power and claiming then they're actually collective.
[3:50:08.120 --> 3:50:10.120]  God is about independent will.
[3:50:10.120 --> 3:50:14.120]  But then if you're independent will, you join with God and the great plan, which is the total collectivism.
[3:50:14.120 --> 3:50:18.120]  You know, we understand as we see this moving forward as he pointed out as a spiritual warfare.
[3:50:18.120 --> 3:50:23.120]  And that's why we see this continuing pattern coming through generation after generation.
[3:50:23.120 --> 3:50:25.120]  We don't know when this is going to happen.
[3:50:25.120 --> 3:50:27.120]  We saw this happen with Adolf Hitler.
[3:50:27.120 --> 3:50:28.120]  Everybody said, this is the end of the world.
[3:50:28.120 --> 3:50:29.120]  We got a world war.
[3:50:29.120 --> 3:50:31.120]  Look at the weapons that we have and so forth.
[3:50:31.120 --> 3:50:32.120]  We don't know when that's going to come.
[3:50:32.120 --> 3:50:37.120]  But we keep seeing this repeat in a cycle because it's coming from the prince of this world.
[3:50:37.120 --> 3:50:39.120]  So ultimately it is a spiritual warfare.
[3:50:39.120 --> 3:50:40.120]  It's his mind. It's his plan.
[3:50:40.120 --> 3:50:41.120]  Yeah, exactly.
[3:50:41.120 --> 3:50:42.120]  We're facing the devil.
[3:50:42.120 --> 3:50:43.120]  That's right.
[3:50:43.120 --> 3:50:44.120]  All right. Take over the final segment.
[3:50:44.120 --> 3:50:45.120]  We'll try to get these other calls.
[3:50:45.120 --> 3:50:46.120]  We can't have not understand.
[3:50:46.120 --> 3:50:47.120]  Not only is it night seven o'clock central.
[3:50:47.120 --> 3:50:49.120]  I think it's a lot of it, but they covered quite a bit of it.
[3:50:49.120 --> 3:50:50.120]  I'm Alex Jones.
[3:50:50.120 --> 3:50:51.120]  This is the end for war.
[3:50:51.120 --> 3:50:52.120]  This is history.

[3:54:01.120 --> 3:54:21.120]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight here. This last five minutes we're going to try to go through as many of the callers as we've got here. We've got Christian, Siobhan, Nicole, Mankind. Let's go to Christian first. Christian, go ahead.
[3:54:21.120 --> 3:54:36.120]  I wanted to just say, just calling in, talking about everything. This whole planning operation is all funded by George Soros.
[3:54:36.120 --> 3:54:51.120]  If you look at the Black Lives Matter movement, George Soros gave them 14 million dollars to go out here and riot and loot and destroy people's businesses. I've seen it.
[3:54:51.120 --> 3:55:04.120]  I'm all for the men's supposed brutality, but when you got a guy like this that wants to push an open society agenda, this man has been undermined in democracy and dependent sovereignty since 1947.
[3:55:04.120 --> 3:55:23.120]  Both Republican and Democrats are in the pocket of people like this man that wants to push this global agenda. They want to blend all races and coaches together to make a mono race and push everybody's agenda.
[3:55:23.120 --> 3:55:34.120]  Look, I'm like this. I don't care if you are homosexual, whatever you decide to do, but what you're trying to do is force your agenda on everyone else, and that's not right.
[3:55:34.120 --> 3:55:41.120]  They want to take away individual liberties as it is, and they want to make things worse.
[3:55:41.120 --> 3:55:56.120]  As far as Trump's go, this is the elite teaming up against Donald Trump. They want to destroy Donald Trump, as we see it. I'm a black guy, and I stand a very liberal town.
[3:55:56.120 --> 3:56:11.120]  And conservatives come off as if you're a conservative, either racist or you are a sellout, and that's another issue. Why can't we just all come together with one idea to all work together?
[3:56:11.120 --> 3:56:15.120]  What they're trying to do is destroy everything.
[3:56:15.120 --> 3:56:29.120]  Well, it's something that they put out for a very long time. Cloward and Piven, we talked about that a couple of sociologists who said, look, we have a welfare state. We can use this with massive immigration to overwhelm not only a country, but also its economic system.
[3:56:29.120 --> 3:56:40.120]  That's the plan that George Soros is doing, and he is fomenting revolution everywhere they can. It is the great people replacement. They're trying to replace American culture, and that's black and white.
[3:56:40.120 --> 3:56:52.120]  They're trying to bring in people in large numbers and tell them not to assimilate, but to divide and conquer the countries. And we see this happening throughout Europe, and every nationality, we see this happening here in America.
[3:56:52.120 --> 3:57:06.120]  That is their tool. They destroy so they can rebuild what they want to rebuild out of the ashes, and they understand that the only opposition they're going to get is from western developed countries where they have an economy, where they have an educated population.
[3:57:06.120 --> 3:57:13.120]  Those are going to be the people who are going to oppose their globalist agenda. So those countries need to be shut down. That is absolutely the technique.
[3:57:13.120 --> 3:57:20.120]  Thank you, Christian. Let's move on to some of the other callers we've been waiting to get as many as we can. Let's go to Siobhan. Siobhan, go ahead.
[3:57:20.120 --> 3:57:44.120]  Good afternoon. I'm calling as a black woman from the state of Mississippi who exercises my second amendment right by open carrion. And I want to make a point to the fact that it's pretty sad that in the black community, and it's always been this way, growing up in a family that is heavily involved politically.
[3:57:44.120 --> 3:57:58.120]  If you are raised in your black and you have this mindset that from the jump, you are automatically Republican. You're not a Republican. Republicans are against you. They don't want to do anything for you.
[3:57:58.120 --> 3:58:26.120]  And to grow up and to see all the backdoor dealing that was going on in the Democratic party started with congressman Danny Thompson. That's just one of the people that I was directly involved with growing up and being aware of all the dealings and what they really think about black people and to use in particularly black people like Jesse Jackson.
[3:58:26.120 --> 3:58:35.120]  Absolutely. The scales come off and you can't put that toothpaste back in the tube once you see the betrayal and the treachery and how they've used and manipulating.
[3:58:35.120 --> 3:58:57.120]  Thank you so much. I'm sorry we couldn't get to the other callers. Join us tonight for the M4 Wars Nightly News, 7th Central, 8 p.m. Eastern. This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
