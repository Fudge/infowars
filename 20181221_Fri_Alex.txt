[00:00.000 --> 00:16.280]  It's the most wonderful time of the year Well, it certainly is an incredible time to
[00:16.280 --> 00:26.800]  be alive Globalism vs. Nationalism, a cold civil war going on in DC, censorship happening
[00:26.800 --> 00:34.320]  in the West, all kinds of stuff, 5G being rolled out. This is the Alex Jones Show filling
[00:34.320 --> 00:37.640]  in for Alex Jones. I'm Owen Troyer. Alex Jones is with us. He's on the phone. He's
[00:37.640 --> 00:43.160]  going to be with us here for the at least first hour. Alex, give us a breakdown of what
[00:43.160 --> 00:48.520]  is going to be covered on today's broadcast. Well, that's right, Owen. I can never really
[00:48.520 --> 00:52.840]  take off, but I was going to take off the day and maybe with some family, but there's
[00:52.840 --> 00:59.640]  no way I can do that with the just incredibly historic things that are happening. I've told
[00:59.640 --> 01:05.280]  the listeners, we're going to see a quickening here. I think people don't need me to tell
[01:05.280 --> 01:14.240]  them that, but Trump is really attempting to deliver on common sense, moral, just policies,
[01:14.240 --> 01:19.400]  not Machiavellian divide and conquer policies. He's also going to be very, very firm with
[01:19.400 --> 01:24.840]  other countries though, if they make deals and then renege on them. And that's why the
[01:24.840 --> 01:27.680]  globalists are so angry at him because they want to play both sides. We are witnessing
[01:27.680 --> 01:32.600]  Trump deliver on almost everything he said he would do. And now that he's cleaning house
[01:32.600 --> 01:37.840]  and getting rid of all these people, they're actually blocking what he originally wanted
[01:37.840 --> 01:44.360]  to do. That includes Manus and that includes Kelly and all these people. The establishment
[01:44.360 --> 01:50.000]  is really getting ready to make their move. But the good news is Trump knows that he knows
[01:50.000 --> 01:54.840]  history is happening right now. He's not going to be lukewarm anymore. He is going to go with
[01:54.840 --> 02:00.560]  his own leadership and his own understanding that's proven to be very, very accurate.
[02:00.560 --> 02:05.520]  And so we were about to see just incredible things unfold. We saw me praying for President
[02:05.520 --> 02:10.080]  Trump, but I thought that when we come back from break, we'd walk through the accomplishments
[02:10.080 --> 02:13.600]  and we walk through some of the areas that he has not gotten things done. But you notice
[02:13.600 --> 02:22.200]  suddenly on all those areas of criminal justice reform, of the border wall, on pulling out
[02:22.200 --> 02:26.360]  of Syria, pulling out of Afghanistan, that's even bigger. That's America's longest war.
[02:26.360 --> 02:32.560]  Now 18 years, Trump is now really going into high gear. And we finally have a real president.
[02:32.560 --> 02:37.640]  You can agree with him. You can disagree with him. But we have a real president. We haven't
[02:37.640 --> 02:44.440]  had this really since Reagan partially or JFK. We have a real president actually acting
[02:44.440 --> 02:49.800]  as if he was elected and as if he was making the decisions. And all the council on foreign
[02:49.800 --> 02:54.840]  relations and all these globalist groups like to sell the influence out to the highest bidder
[02:54.840 --> 02:59.000]  and then they call it consensus. It's not. It's called treason. They are beside themselves.
[02:59.000 --> 03:04.000]  So Trump's doing the biggest thing you could do to grant the swamp. He's taking their power
[03:04.000 --> 03:09.640]  and their money away. That's why the Clinton Foundation has 93% less money coming in every
[03:09.640 --> 03:14.520]  year than it did just two years ago because Trump is taking the influence away. And that's
[03:14.520 --> 03:18.200]  why the big lobbyists, the big Republican groups, the big neocon groups are all out
[03:18.200 --> 03:22.440]  to get him. So folks, you ever wondered if Trump was the real deal? About a year ago,
[03:22.440 --> 03:26.640]  I flipped out when he bombed Syria that second time, but he kept listening to Mattis that
[03:26.640 --> 03:30.040]  that was the right thing to do. That would actually end it. It didn't. And then he said,
[03:30.040 --> 03:34.120]  I'm going to go with my instincts next time and what I promised to do to the voters. And
[03:34.120 --> 03:37.680]  so now he's doing that. So this is the time that they could assassinate the president
[03:37.680 --> 03:43.800]  or, or, or, or, or try to cause a major physical civil war. So we'll be breaking that down.
[03:43.800 --> 03:50.000]  Also Sasha Barakon in his own TV show was trying to joke around about pedophilia and
[03:50.000 --> 03:54.000]  found a hotel official that was there ready to cover it up with him. And they were even
[03:54.000 --> 03:58.880]  talking about killing kids. So all of that shocking stuff is coming up. And we've also
[03:58.880 --> 04:04.960]  got Louis Gilmour, when I was there two weeks ago in Congress, he said, listen, Google Sundar,
[04:04.960 --> 04:09.760]  I'm coming after you to get rid of your liability protection in section 230, since you don't
[04:09.760 --> 04:14.840]  operate as a section 230 exists for, for your users. Well, it doesn't exist for you anymore.
[04:14.840 --> 04:19.680]  He introduced legislation to do that as well. There is just so much. And of course, a really
[04:19.680 --> 04:24.080]  big story that's been out for a few days. Remember when Derspiegel was in our offices
[04:24.080 --> 04:29.120]  last year? And the guy lied and said that I said, suck my sausages. If I would say that
[04:29.120 --> 04:33.600]  to anybody, he comes to the conference room, I'm in there eating my lunch. And I said,
[04:33.600 --> 04:38.640]  please. And I said, would you like some barbecue? We have brisket. We have sausage. That turns
[04:38.640 --> 04:42.960]  into suck my sausage. Well, these very same type of reporters have been busted, not just
[04:42.960 --> 04:47.880]  one. The whole dam is about to break. Going to the Texas, Arizona, New Mexico border and
[04:47.880 --> 04:55.360]  the lying wholesale about white people hating Hispanics, just total made up garbage about
[04:55.360 --> 05:00.440]  crimes against Hispanics by white folks will be right back.
[05:00.440 --> 05:04.480]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the
[05:04.480 --> 05:10.800]  law. If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact
[05:10.800 --> 05:16.480]  that the emperor has no clothes that can call BS, it's game over. But if you look at everybody
[05:16.480 --> 05:20.680]  else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they
[05:20.680 --> 05:26.480]  are all beholded to the networks they're on that can be targeted. There's only two groups
[05:26.480 --> 05:33.000]  in the U.S. Infowars and Matt Rudge of rudgereport.com that are truly independent. And of course
[05:33.000 --> 05:37.440]  there are two of the dominant media forces in the world. It really is amazing. That's
[05:37.440 --> 05:42.120]  why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're
[05:42.120 --> 05:45.600]  all in and how far we've come together. Just remind you that you are the power, you're
[05:45.600 --> 05:51.840]  the strength, you're the will of Infowars. So please spread the links. Infowars.com,
[05:51.840 --> 05:55.880]  NewsWars.com, christenpana.com. Because if you don't spread the articles in the videos,
[05:55.880 --> 06:21.280]  no one else will. We're all in each other's hands. God bless you all and thank you.
[06:21.280 --> 06:26.000]  President got elected to get our foreign policy back on the right track after years of being
[06:26.000 --> 06:30.680]  adrift. One foreign policy blunder after another in Iraq, in Afghanistan, in Libya.
[06:30.680 --> 06:37.280]  So does the president want to withdraw the 14,000 troops from Afghanistan and the 5,000
[06:37.280 --> 06:44.080]  U.S. troops in Iraq in addition to the 2,000 troops in Syria? I have no, I have absolutely
[06:44.080 --> 06:48.480]  no policy announcements of any kind to make tonight whatsoever. What I'm talking about,
[06:48.480 --> 06:54.600]  Wolf, is the big picture of a country that through several administrations had an absolutely
[06:54.600 --> 06:59.400]  catastrophic foreign policy that cost trillions and trillions of dollars and thousands and
[06:59.400 --> 07:02.720]  thousands of lives and made the Middle East more unstable and more dangerous. And let's
[07:02.720 --> 07:08.120]  talk about Syria. Let's talk about the fact. ISIS is the enemy of Russia. ISIS is the
[07:08.120 --> 07:13.880]  enemy of Assad. ISIS is the enemy of Turkey. Are we supposed to stay in Syria for generation
[07:13.880 --> 07:25.400]  after generation, spilling them dirt and blood to fight the enemies of all those countries?
[07:25.400 --> 07:31.040]  That, ladies and gentlemen, that was Stephen Miller, one of the chief advisers of the president,
[07:31.040 --> 07:36.720]  a great patriot, who was interviewed several times before. And he's laying out the facts.
[07:36.720 --> 07:40.880]  We've had an 18-year war in Afghanistan that's killed thousands and thousands and thousands
[07:40.880 --> 07:47.320]  of U.S. troops, contractors, and others. And it's designed so that these big contracting
[07:47.320 --> 07:53.600]  companies and other organizations can sit there and make record profits. And all of
[07:53.600 --> 07:59.040]  this is designed long-term to sap American industry, to sap American money and not allow
[07:59.040 --> 08:03.240]  us to have infrastructure. So while the EU builds up and while Communist China builds
[08:03.240 --> 08:09.640]  up and has a huge blue water navy and while they economically take over, we are bleeding
[08:09.640 --> 08:15.400]  out in all of these wars. It was Obama who turned the Arab Spring loose eight years ago
[08:15.400 --> 08:24.640]  and sent ISIS, re-branded al-Qaeda, streaming in to Syria to then have Syria fall so that
[08:24.640 --> 08:31.000]  they can cause an Islamic revolution to invade right through into Turkey and Europe. So what
[08:31.000 --> 08:36.320]  Trump is doing by going in with Assad and with the Russians, a plan that our Pentagon
[08:36.320 --> 08:41.680]  came out with four years before Trump even got into office, our Pentagon blocked Obama
[08:41.680 --> 08:46.400]  and said, it's immoral to bring this country down and turn it over to al-Qaeda and then
[08:46.400 --> 08:51.840]  ISIS and then let that collapse into the borders of Europe. We're not going to let you do this
[08:51.840 --> 08:57.520]  in your plan to Islamify Europe, which we've now still seen Obama and Soros try to carry
[08:57.520 --> 09:03.320]  it out. But if Trump, and before that the Pentagon, the good people of Pentagon, let
[09:03.320 --> 09:09.080]  my Rand Paul and Senator Cruz and others, if we hadn't of all pushed for that six, seven
[09:09.080 --> 09:15.440]  years ago, Europe would have completely been collapsed into the huge Islamic caliphate
[09:15.440 --> 09:16.480]  that was being set up.
[09:16.480 --> 09:24.040]  So Trump got advised by General Flynn and by General Jones and by others. General Jones
[09:24.040 --> 09:31.600]  had been the head of the National Security Council and got briefings once he was running
[09:31.600 --> 09:38.480]  for office about the larger plan to collapse the Middle East into Europe as part of this
[09:38.480 --> 09:44.040]  larger plan. So Trump was simply continuing on with a plan of good generals and good patriots
[09:44.040 --> 09:49.160]  in our government who blocked Obama's plan or partially blocked it six, seven years ago
[09:49.160 --> 09:56.960]  to be al-Qaeda's air force, ISIS's air force. So Trump ran on getting out of Afghanistan.
[09:56.960 --> 10:02.600]  Trump ran on getting us out of Syria. And then he listened to Mattis and he listened to Kelly
[10:02.600 --> 10:07.560]  with the same old stories we've got to stay there. And then he discovered, confirmed reports
[10:07.560 --> 10:12.280]  that our military, because they were telling Trump, was being ordered to bring supply columns
[10:12.280 --> 10:19.000]  in, not just to Kurdish terrorists who are attacking Turkey and destabilizing things
[10:19.000 --> 10:26.400]  in Syria, but also to ISIS. And Trump continued to order them to stop doing this, but the
[10:26.400 --> 10:31.920]  mid-level and high-level commanders were double-crossing America, double-crossing Trump, double-crossing
[10:31.920 --> 10:37.280]  the Russians in the deal that higher-ups had made six, seven years ago, and were continuing
[10:37.280 --> 10:43.840]  to destabilize the area by shipping weapons in to ISIS and to the Kurds, which then kept
[10:43.840 --> 10:49.120]  the war going and then gives Hezbollah and the Iranians an excuse to stay in the area.
[10:49.120 --> 10:55.200]  What Trump has done now is go to Saudi Arabia and said, never fund a Wahhabist al-Qaeda ISIS
[10:55.200 --> 11:02.080]  group again, like Al-Nusra. We will, a regime change you. He's then told Iran, you keep
[11:02.080 --> 11:06.520]  doing this with Hezbollah in this civil war, we're going to bomb you as well. We're going
[11:06.520 --> 11:11.160]  to bomb all your ships and your oil fields. And he's put the sanctions on them to show
[11:11.160 --> 11:16.880]  how serious he is. And he's told Ergun, you better stand down and stop attacking the Kurds
[11:16.880 --> 11:23.240]  and you better stand down and stop sending troops in to try to overthrow Damascus, or
[11:23.240 --> 11:26.120]  we're going to continue to have economic sanctions on you.
[11:26.120 --> 11:32.840]  And Trump finally got all these sides, including Israel, to agree to stop meddling in Syria
[11:32.840 --> 11:38.680]  in this giant seven-way war, seven-way war, but still insiders in the deep state, the
[11:38.680 --> 11:44.440]  neocons and others, and Obama with a shadow policy where he follows Trump around and tries
[11:44.440 --> 11:50.480]  to derail what Trump just did. They were still sending in convoys of U.S. forces with trucks
[11:50.480 --> 11:56.000]  by the hundreds of days supplying heavy weapons and ammunition to the final ISIS stronghold.
[11:56.000 --> 12:03.320]  So by Trump cutting off this supply to the Kurds and ISIS, he did finally cut the head
[12:03.320 --> 12:13.120]  off if the corrupt elements of the CIA are not allowed to resupply those forces. So Trump
[12:13.120 --> 12:17.520]  needs to be prayed for. Nobody since Kennedy has tried to get us out of wars like this.
[12:17.520 --> 12:20.680]  The announcement of 7,000 troops, that's half the troops in Afghanistan being pulled
[12:20.680 --> 12:25.600]  out. The announcement of 2,000 troops, that's almost all the troops in Syria being pulled
[12:25.600 --> 12:32.080]  out. The announcement of this happening and everything but forward observers, basically
[12:32.080 --> 12:36.680]  spies and special operations being there, now that all of this is happening, Trump is completely
[12:36.680 --> 12:43.560]  delivering on his foreign policy promises to pull out of TPP, to renegotiate NAFTA and
[12:43.560 --> 12:49.280]  yet to renegotiate all these other major deals, to stand up for national sovereignty, to get
[12:49.280 --> 12:54.520]  Japan and South Korea and the EU to kick in more to NATO. And the hundreds of billions
[12:54.520 --> 13:00.440]  a year now that we'll save, it'll come back to rebuild our actual military hardware, next
[13:00.440 --> 13:05.720]  generation systems, and to take care of the troops. Trump's basically had a 40% pay raise
[13:05.720 --> 13:12.040]  for the average enlisted people. That's about to go up even more. Trump has already slowed
[13:12.040 --> 13:19.240]  wait times by about 40% to 45% for the VA. I mean, he is battling as hard as he can.
[13:19.240 --> 13:24.000]  And listen, the only reason I'm saying all this is, it's true. It's true. So everything
[13:24.000 --> 13:30.800]  he's been doing has been tainted by the establishment not following through with his directives,
[13:30.800 --> 13:34.720]  but now he's removing all the people that were standing in the way of that. And the
[13:34.720 --> 13:42.000]  only blemishes on the president is that after the horror of Las Vegas and again, the NRA
[13:42.000 --> 13:46.200]  saying, sir, no one wants to bump stocks. They're useless. There's no lobby for him.
[13:46.200 --> 13:50.560]  Nobody cares. He said, fine, give the lefts a bone, you know, ban these. That's a bad
[13:50.560 --> 13:54.800]  thing. He hasn't done enough on vaccines, but we wouldn't have these two good Supreme
[13:54.800 --> 13:59.400]  Court justices. We wouldn't have all his pro-gun speeches he's given standing up when there's
[13:59.400 --> 14:03.400]  these mass shootings, not blaming the Second Amendment. Overall, I give him an A on the
[14:03.400 --> 14:08.240]  Second Amendment, not an A plus. I give him an A plus on everything else except for vaccines.
[14:08.240 --> 14:12.000]  I give him a B plus because at least he's talked about them and said they're dangerous,
[14:12.000 --> 14:17.200]  that people should do their own research. He's marched in pro-life rallies, something
[14:17.200 --> 14:21.400]  no Republican ever did. He's called for states to have the control over abortion and to
[14:21.400 --> 14:25.880]  be able to curtail it down to nothing. And so anybody buying in the leftist hype that
[14:25.880 --> 14:30.480]  Trump hasn't delivered, he's a fool. You know, he said, I'll shut the government down and
[14:30.480 --> 14:33.840]  people said, oh, he's bulking. He's not going to shut it down over the border wall. He just
[14:33.840 --> 14:39.040]  did it. The house then bulked and passed it. Will it pass the Senate? I don't know. But
[14:39.040 --> 14:46.160]  God has literally given us a last chance reprieve in the West with Donald John Trump to, I can't
[14:46.160 --> 14:51.800]  believe he's gotten this much done. And I know how real he is because he's been persecuted.
[14:51.800 --> 14:57.200]  And anyone that supports him is absolutely, massively persecuted because the system, the
[14:57.200 --> 15:03.000]  world system absolutely hates this man because he has become the first real president in
[15:03.000 --> 15:07.680]  decades who's actually operating like he is in charge of the executive and not a bunch
[15:07.680 --> 15:13.000]  of foreign globalist boards like the Council on Foreign Relations. And he's got China major
[15:13.000 --> 15:17.840]  renegotiation. He's got everything happening, but the private Federal Reserve is working
[15:17.840 --> 15:22.360]  with foreign enemies and the Democrats to try to derail our economy so that America turns
[15:22.360 --> 15:28.560]  against this real president who's gone to bat. And then they get even more wild. It was
[15:28.560 --> 15:37.320]  the Democrats in 1993 that passed the minimum sentencing laws where if a black person has
[15:37.320 --> 15:41.400]  cocaine, they get three times the amount of time in jail as a white person. It was Hillary
[15:41.400 --> 15:46.160]  that called blacks dogs that must be brought to heel. Trump is now passing the law and signing
[15:46.160 --> 15:51.080]  it to repeal that. And the left is attacking him for it. We'll be right back, ladies and
[15:51.080 --> 16:03.320]  gentlemen. Stay with us. Hear that. That's the sound of a house being trashed while a
[16:03.320 --> 16:10.520]  gang of thieves ransacked the place. And what they don't steal will be destroyed this year.

[19:02.920 --> 19:07.480]  corporate world government that's above the law. If there's any opposition, if there's
[19:07.480 --> 19:12.760]  any independent media that can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes, they can
[19:12.760 --> 19:17.960]  call BS. It's game over. But if you look at everybody else like Michael Savage and Rush
[19:17.960 --> 19:22.320]  Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're
[19:22.320 --> 19:29.000]  on that can be targeted. There's only two groups in the U.S. Infowars and Matt Drudge
[19:29.000 --> 19:34.040]  of Drudge Report.com that are truly independent. And of course, they're two of the dominant
[19:34.040 --> 19:40.280]  media forces in the world. It really is amazing. That's why as we close out 2018, I want to
[19:40.280 --> 19:44.200]  just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[19:44.200 --> 19:49.680]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will of Infowars.
[19:49.680 --> 19:54.400]  So please spread the links, infowarstore.com, newswarstore.com, christenpata.com. Because
[19:54.400 --> 19:58.360]  if you don't spread the articles in the videos, no one else will. We're all in each other's
[19:58.360 --> 20:23.640]  hands. God bless you all and thank you.
[20:23.640 --> 20:29.840]  If it were done by any other man than Donald J. Trump, the left would be celebrating the
[20:29.840 --> 20:34.960]  United States president pulling troops out of the Middle East, getting prison reform
[20:34.960 --> 20:41.320]  done, lowest black unemployment, record number of women appointed to his administration.
[20:41.320 --> 20:46.920]  But because it's Donald Trump and because they had to lie about him, for two years,
[20:46.920 --> 20:52.120]  they cannot give him a victory. Alex Jones is with us here, Owen Schreuer filling in
[20:52.120 --> 20:57.000]  in studio. Alex on the phone, wild horses could not drag him away from the Infowar.
[20:57.000 --> 21:02.000]  So Alex, what we're seeing now is Trump getting some things done battling right now with Congress
[21:02.000 --> 21:06.600]  to try to get a wall. And just like everything else, the Democrats totally out of touch with
[21:06.600 --> 21:11.440]  reality, a government shutdown, which President Trump says could be for a very long time,
[21:11.440 --> 21:16.000]  I think will help his approval ratings. I support a government shutdown, Alex.
[21:16.000 --> 21:22.680]  I do too, but let's just pull back from this because I rarely have an anxiety attack on
[21:22.680 --> 21:26.960]  here. I was probably 20-something years old before I ever had my first anxiety attack
[21:26.960 --> 21:33.240]  and I'm not my big one. I had, you know, 10 glasses of iced tea and okay, so I never
[21:33.240 --> 21:38.480]  have an anxiety attack where I have trouble breathing unless really big stuff is happening.
[21:38.480 --> 21:42.520]  My subconscious brain looks at all the pieces and our subconscious is hundreds of times
[21:42.520 --> 21:48.360]  more powerful than our conscious. And my subconscious tells me, oh my God, we better pray for President
[21:48.360 --> 21:54.480]  Trump right now and we're all in grave danger because evil is absolutely scared right now.
[21:54.480 --> 22:01.240]  And it never gives up. It's going to go absolutely wild. And it's so epic. Everything we cover
[22:01.240 --> 22:07.120]  is already so amazing, but this is so epic. I am getting massive chills right now that
[22:07.120 --> 22:16.400]  the Secretary of Defense gone. His head of operations, the SIVA staff gone. All these
[22:16.400 --> 22:22.160]  people, you know, the QAnon told us was God and then sessions and all that crap, they're
[22:22.160 --> 22:29.000]  gone. They've been standing in the way of things. And I've discovered them in the last
[22:29.000 --> 22:34.040]  few days about who the traders were at the beginning in the White House and how they
[22:34.040 --> 22:38.480]  all worked together to do what they did and how it was banning that convinced Trump to
[22:38.480 --> 22:45.280]  bring these guys in and how the whole nest has now been removed and the whole nest has
[22:45.280 --> 22:50.280]  been basically pulled out. And so now Whitaker, he's like, no, I'm not recusing myself on
[22:50.280 --> 23:01.880]  Russia gate. And no, I, as the big inspector general of report just said, Whitaker is over
[23:01.880 --> 23:06.080]  Mueller. So Mueller can't even release any of his fake reports without authorization
[23:06.080 --> 23:10.800]  from Whitaker. So we're learning about the real power of the president as he steps into
[23:10.800 --> 23:17.240]  it and stops letting these little nobodies, these little rogue government traders completely
[23:17.240 --> 23:21.520]  take over. But let's be specific and let's drill into one of these at a time. So I want
[23:21.520 --> 23:24.640]  to come into criminal justice reform next segment, really define what's happened here
[23:24.640 --> 23:27.920]  and what Trump's doing and what he's not doing. But let's just pull back here for a moment
[23:27.920 --> 23:35.080]  and think about this. Trump 100% was the guy that opened up the most elite clubs and golf
[23:35.080 --> 23:42.280]  courses to everybody 45 years ago when he started buying them up. Trump 100% is the guy
[23:42.280 --> 23:46.160]  that invited people to erase religion and color to stay at his house. That's why all the black
[23:46.160 --> 23:50.520]  community absolutely loved him. Okay. Cause he went on vacation with folks and had him
[23:50.520 --> 23:54.160]  to his clubs and boosted people and everything else. Everybody else knew how cool Donald
[23:54.160 --> 23:58.200]  Trump was. I know folks have known Donald for 30, 40 years, not just Roger Stone. The guy
[23:58.200 --> 24:02.400]  would stay up all night with, you know, white people, black people, you name it, having
[24:02.400 --> 24:07.120]  fun all over town, doing great stuff, going to shows, eating great dinners, laughing and
[24:07.120 --> 24:14.880]  joking. He's a really cool guy. Okay. And again, it's so sick to then see the entire
[24:14.880 --> 24:19.440]  corporate press call him a racist, call me a racist to try to divide everybody, but it
[24:19.440 --> 24:23.160]  hasn't worked. That's why Trump's getting 30, 35% approval ratings with blacks when
[24:23.160 --> 24:29.640]  I know the Republican ever got about 15%. And so some people say, well, there's violent
[24:29.640 --> 24:34.200]  predators. Trump's going to let go under this legislation. No, that's not what it is. He's
[24:34.200 --> 24:37.840]  getting tough on open borders. He's getting tough on solid smugglers. He's getting tough
[24:37.840 --> 24:42.400]  on MS 13. He's getting tough on people that are dealing drugs with weapons that they're
[24:42.400 --> 24:47.840]  going to be put under the jail, but he saw the cases and the groups and the liberal groups,
[24:47.840 --> 24:53.960]  the leftist groups that brought him all the examples of people caught 20 years ago with
[24:53.960 --> 24:58.040]  illegal drugs, but they weren't violent. And they've been in jail for 20 years. And then,
[24:58.040 --> 25:02.280]  you know, child molesters are let out in three years. Trump says, no, we don't need minimum
[25:02.280 --> 25:07.720]  sentencing, you know, for these so-called drugs. We need to go out for the drug dealers,
[25:07.720 --> 25:11.440]  not the drug users. In fact, he's even tougher on drug dealers. He wants them executed. I
[25:11.440 --> 25:15.600]  think that probably goes too far. But the point is, is that he's very pragmatic. He
[25:15.600 --> 25:19.760]  knows what works. And it's Hillary Clinton. We have the video saying blacks are super
[25:19.760 --> 25:24.920]  predators. They must be brought to heal like a dog. You put a chain on the dog and drag
[25:24.920 --> 25:31.120]  it to your knee. And we need to pass this legislation that specifically tripled the
[25:31.120 --> 25:36.520]  number of black people in prisons and destroyed all those families while the CIA, the leftist
[25:36.520 --> 25:41.320]  arm, was putting out gangster rap to weaponize young black men and make them think it's
[25:41.320 --> 25:48.240]  cool to behave in a way that directs them straight into prison. So we're all struggling
[25:48.240 --> 25:51.880]  with the same brainwashing. We're all struggling with the same targeting. And the fact that
[25:51.880 --> 25:57.320]  Trump's done this, you'll see some backhanded stuff where, well, Trump's got his one little
[25:57.320 --> 26:01.560]  thing, but it was really the Democrats that did this. No, the Democrats could never pass
[26:01.560 --> 26:07.240]  reform. They're the ones that did it. It was LBJ that first said in the sixties, the blacks
[26:07.240 --> 26:11.440]  are getting too uppity. His words, not mine. The inwards are too uppity. We're gonna pay
[26:11.440 --> 26:15.040]  to have the women kick the men out of the house and we'll have them vote in Democrat
[26:15.040 --> 26:19.760]  for a hundred years and we'll take full control of their families. And the model they've
[26:19.760 --> 26:24.280]  used on black people, they've now used on everybody, ladies and gentlemen. And so Trump
[26:24.280 --> 26:31.920]  doing this is an absolute proof that he stands for justice and that he wants the right thing.
[26:31.920 --> 26:37.160]  And if black Americans don't absolutely admit the Democrats have brainwashed them,
[26:37.160 --> 26:41.880]  like they've done everybody else, and really come out for Trump, then I don't want to hear
[26:41.880 --> 26:46.800]  anybody ever bitching complain about getting thrown in prison for long sentences for things
[26:46.800 --> 26:54.040]  that they probably didn't deserve when Trump just went to bat for you 100%. And he's got
[26:54.040 --> 26:59.280]  the less than everybody trying to spin this and pull all this garbage. And again, 18 years
[26:59.280 --> 27:04.680]  in Afghanistan, all these years in Syria, saying he'd pull out. And then the Pentagon
[27:04.680 --> 27:07.760]  tried to block him from doing it, but that was one branch of the Pentagon. The smart
[27:07.760 --> 27:12.440]  people in the Pentagon are the ones that stopped Obama, bringing Syria completely down as a
[27:12.440 --> 27:18.240]  gateway into Turkey and the rest of Europe. So Trump is upsetting the entire globalist
[27:18.240 --> 27:23.080]  strategy of tension. That's what it's called the planetary destabilization program and
[27:23.080 --> 27:28.520]  very pragmatically, very pragmatically weighing what's just, what's honorable. And this is
[27:28.520 --> 27:35.680]  important. Telling our friends and our enemies and those that are neutral. Here's our policy.
[27:35.680 --> 27:40.000]  It's clear cut. You want to be friends with us? We're going to have a great future. You
[27:40.000 --> 27:45.080]  mess with us. You pull one game. We're going to blow your ass off the map. There's no more
[27:45.080 --> 27:52.960]  playing games. There's no more playing both sides. The crap is over. America made a deal.
[27:52.960 --> 27:57.200]  The head of the Joint Chiefs, Dempsey, made a deal seven years ago when Senator Paul and
[27:57.200 --> 28:02.280]  Senator Cruz were on the news saying we shouldn't be al-Qaeda's air force. And they said, we
[28:02.280 --> 28:10.200]  are not going to let Obama destroy Syria and kill all these people, these Shiites and Kurds
[28:10.200 --> 28:15.880]  and Christians. We're going to let Russia come in and stabilize it with the U.S. Then
[28:15.880 --> 28:19.960]  we're going to let them have elections and Assad's going to leave. Well, once they defeat
[28:19.960 --> 28:24.280]  ISIS, you will see Assad have elections in the next year. And then if he doesn't leave
[28:24.280 --> 28:28.360]  to go to England or wherever, then they've broken their deal and it's all another ballgame.
[28:28.360 --> 28:36.280]  But as for now, Trump has gotten all the major players, Turkey, Iran, the Syrian government,
[28:36.280 --> 28:42.120]  Israel, Saudi Arabia, the Kurds, all these groups have lined up and said, okay, we will
[28:42.120 --> 28:46.480]  stop this and we understand that this is going to be a free and open country now and that's
[28:46.480 --> 28:50.960]  not a free for all. Well, now the battle's been joined and the Globals are trying to
[28:50.960 --> 28:55.640]  sabotage that and Trump knows internal groups for sabotaging it. He knows top generals were
[28:55.640 --> 28:59.480]  lying to him and that's why he just basically told them to give them.
[28:59.480 --> 29:05.800]  Marijuana has unleashed a green gold rush across our nation. It's creating $10.8 billion
[29:05.800 --> 29:11.800]  in new wealth a year and every day it's transforming more and more Americans into millionaires.
[29:11.800 --> 29:16.680]  In an historic event, former Speaker of the House John Boehner reveals how you could become
[29:16.680 --> 29:22.840]  one of them. Join him online for the American Cannabis Summit. Attendance is 100% free,

[29:42.480 --> 29:47.720]  a cannabis angel investor, backing the hottest startups before they potentially become worth

[31:00.600 --> 31:04.560]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above
[31:04.560 --> 31:10.960]  the law. If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact
[31:10.960 --> 31:16.640]  that the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over. But if you look at everybody
[31:16.640 --> 31:20.840]  else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they
[31:20.840 --> 31:26.640]  are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted. There's only two groups
[31:26.640 --> 31:33.160]  in the U.S. Infowars and Matt Rudge of rudgereport.com that are truly independent, and of course
[31:33.160 --> 31:37.600]  there are two of the dominant media forces in the world. It really is amazing. That's
[31:37.600 --> 31:42.280]  why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're
[31:42.280 --> 31:45.800]  all in and how far we've come together. Just remind you that you are the power, you're
[31:45.800 --> 31:51.920]  the strength, you're the will of Infowars. So please spread the links, infowars.com,
[31:51.920 --> 31:56.040]  newswords.com, christenplata.com, because if you don't spread the articles in the videos,
[31:56.040 --> 32:00.880]  no one else will. We're all in each other's hands. God bless you all, and thank you.
[32:00.880 --> 32:06.000]  Me and Volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is. The real drama can be found
[32:06.000 --> 32:10.920]  here in Leilani Estates, but a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater, and we
[32:10.920 --> 32:17.760]  need to be concerned about ash and acid rain. Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles,
[32:17.760 --> 32:22.960]  and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels. To find out, we employed
[32:22.960 --> 32:29.240]  a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH. What we learned was that there was
[32:29.240 --> 32:34.760]  in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater. Next, we tested
[32:34.760 --> 32:39.840]  the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter, and not only were the heavy metal levels within
[32:39.840 --> 32:46.640]  safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels. As it turns out, the filter
[32:46.640 --> 32:52.280]  on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water, so what we've learned is that volcanic ash
[32:52.280 --> 32:57.720]  and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply. But more importantly, a good water
[32:57.720 --> 32:59.720]  filtration system will purify it.
[33:28.720 --> 33:36.560]  I salute President Donald J. Trump for getting a big victory and declaring victory for our
[33:36.560 --> 33:42.280]  military in Syria and bringing the troops home. Who knows, maybe some of them are able
[33:42.280 --> 33:47.280]  to make it home for Christmas even. Wouldn't that be something? This was done by President
[33:47.280 --> 33:53.000]  Donald J. Trump, and again, if this was anyone else, the Democrats would be celebrating it.
[33:53.000 --> 33:58.040]  The peaceniks, the left, the liberals would say, wow, finally, a man that wants to stop
[33:58.040 --> 34:02.240]  wars in the Middle East. But because it's Donald Trump, the American media, Republicans
[34:02.240 --> 34:10.320]  and Democrats alike are all trying to convince us that we need to be in Syria or Afghanistan
[34:10.320 --> 34:17.320]  to protect our national security, but won't even commit to securing our own border. Alex
[34:17.320 --> 34:23.840]  Jones is on the phone right now. He is out of studio. Alex, it really, I think, proves
[34:23.840 --> 34:28.200]  you right on something you've been talking about for so long, which is the military industrial
[34:28.200 --> 34:33.560]  complex, which, of course, Eisenhower warned us about years ago, between the media and
[34:33.560 --> 34:35.560]  the fake two-party system.
[34:35.560 --> 34:44.560]  Well, I'm just sitting back here and watching what's happening on Fox, CNN, MSNBC. There's
[34:44.560 --> 34:49.920]  articles on infowars.com that people have got to go see. They've got major conservative
[34:49.920 --> 34:58.120]  news sites, a newspaper saying, we need a military coup against the president for treason, for
[34:58.120 --> 35:04.840]  pulling us out of Syria and starting to move the troops out of Afghanistan. He ran on that.
[35:04.840 --> 35:13.000]  We elected him. And then Matt Souther said, sir, have a surge for a year, and that'll
[35:13.000 --> 35:18.240]  make the Afghans super peace. And he said, okay, I'll give you one shot. He gave him
[35:18.240 --> 35:24.320]  almost two years, and the number of truth deaths went up. But we also noticed, wherever
[35:24.320 --> 35:28.600]  the Chinese moved into Afghanistan, they got blown up even worse than we did. So Trump's
[35:28.600 --> 35:33.520]  sitting back saying, why are we going to be there, except for these big companies making
[35:33.520 --> 35:38.080]  money? And Trump says, I'll let the big defense companies make money here, but on new hardware
[35:38.080 --> 35:43.160]  and new weapons to win wars with China or others, we don't need to sit there and piss
[35:43.160 --> 35:49.480]  our money and our blood down a rattle in the middle of Afghanistan or the middle of Syria.
[35:49.480 --> 35:54.680]  But let's pull back here. It was Obama and Google that openly in Facebook that helped
[35:54.680 --> 35:59.800]  push 10 years ago. Yes, it's already almost 10 years, nine years ago, the Arab Spring.
[35:59.800 --> 36:03.880]  Obama was in office two years, a year and a half, and it started. And they, oh, it's
[36:03.880 --> 36:07.720]  wonderful. They're overthrowing our allies in Syria. Oh, they set up Qaddafi who was
[36:07.720 --> 36:11.840]  working with the West and killed him and put Al Qaeda in charge. Oh, they're trying to
[36:11.840 --> 36:16.560]  overthrow Jordan. They're trying to overthrow Syria. And all these civil war start and Anderson
[36:16.560 --> 36:21.760]  Cooper is on TV saying how great it is. And then our own military goes were turning the
[36:21.760 --> 36:26.600]  entire Middle East over to basically Saudi Arabia and the Muslim Brotherhood and Al Qaeda
[36:26.600 --> 36:32.400]  and ISIS. So as soon as the public figured out that Al Qaeda was running all this and
[36:32.400 --> 36:36.400]  that Obama was helping them, they changed the name to Islamic State, which is only the
[36:36.400 --> 36:43.080]  Islamic State of Al Qaeda, which means the base, which means the state again. So the
[36:43.080 --> 36:48.480]  state, the base, the command base, the homeland, that's all Al Qaeda means is the base. It's
[36:48.480 --> 36:53.560]  the same black flag with the same Arabic letters. It's the hobbyism. So Trump first goes to
[36:53.560 --> 36:58.040]  Saudi Arabia and says, knock it off. You're going to stop this. They take out the Al Qaeda
[36:58.040 --> 37:03.440]  ISIS forces. Saudi Arabia agrees. They'd always been following orders of the global system
[37:03.440 --> 37:07.000]  to pull this crap to begin with. British intelligence put the Saudis in power starting
[37:07.000 --> 37:12.320]  in 1906. And then through 1931, submit other power. Then he goes to everybody else and
[37:12.320 --> 37:17.760]  they agree, except Iran. And Iran says, no, we're not going to stop. So Trump says, well,
[37:17.760 --> 37:21.520]  we're going to put sanctions on you. We're going to kill your troops and we're going
[37:21.520 --> 37:26.080]  to push them out. And now Iran reportedly behind the scenes is pulling Hezbollah out
[37:26.080 --> 37:30.760]  and the Assad regime is agreeing that if we do pull out and it's real, that again, he
[37:30.760 --> 37:36.120]  will leave. But regardless, this is what the president promised to do. And it's Obama that
[37:36.120 --> 37:41.280]  created the Arab Spring. It's the globalists that created ISIS. And now Trump's being called
[37:41.280 --> 37:47.000]  soft on ISIS. Well, he's the guy that made the point that Hillary and Obama founded ISIS.
[37:47.000 --> 37:51.600]  And he's the one working with the Russians with our military that is basically decapitated
[37:51.600 --> 37:56.520]  ISIS down to this one final group. And I know I just keep repeating this, folks, because
[37:56.520 --> 38:03.640]  this is so incredibly huge. And then, as you said, Owen, they look at us and they say,
[38:03.640 --> 38:09.720]  oh, you crazy Trump supporters, you're endangering America. There's going to be a new 9-11. It's
[38:09.720 --> 38:15.000]  Trump that banned people from six Al-Qaeda countries. It's Trump that asked people getting
[38:15.000 --> 38:19.200]  deported and arrested with ties to it. It's Trump that's trying to get better screening
[38:19.200 --> 38:23.720]  of this. It's Trump that wants a border wall. It's Trump that increased the size of customs
[38:23.720 --> 38:31.200]  via ICE. And so he's literally doing what you do normally as a president under his duty
[38:31.200 --> 38:36.280]  to defend the border, to try to stop the drug smugglers, the child smugglers, the Al-Qaeda,
[38:36.280 --> 38:42.960]  the ISIS, the Wahhabis, the Hezbollah. And he's doing everything he can to stop people
[38:42.960 --> 38:47.040]  from unvetted countries. And that's a great point, Owen. And the control corporate left
[38:47.040 --> 38:52.360]  and the control corporate right all gang up on Trump and say, you've endangered us. No,
[38:52.360 --> 38:58.600]  he is now got the house to pass the 5.5 billion for the border wall. He's now done it. And
[38:58.600 --> 39:03.720]  now it's going to the Senate. He's done everything he can. In fact, he's threatening the shutdown.
[39:03.720 --> 39:09.240]  He didn't blink. Now the question is, are Americans smart enough to see and witness
[39:09.240 --> 39:14.720]  what we are witnessing? I mean, Trump thought, hey, the private fellow reserve, the globalist,
[39:14.720 --> 39:18.360]  one side of trade deals had their foot on our neck. If I get some of these regulations
[39:18.360 --> 39:22.480]  out of the way in a tax cut and tell folks, Rubber, for business, we'll get record low
[39:22.480 --> 39:25.880]  unemployment. We'll get some new investment. It happened. So the federal reserve raises
[39:25.880 --> 39:31.280]  interest rates seven times. Never did it under Obama. The economy starts to tank. So what
[39:31.280 --> 39:36.440]  does the federal reserve do? Raises it some more. These people are clear and present enemies
[39:36.440 --> 39:40.840]  of our country. They want us captured and controlled. And I know the audience knows
[39:40.840 --> 39:45.200]  this. The point is, I knew Trump was for real because how they came after him. And now he
[39:45.200 --> 39:49.220]  got out of TPP and now he got some decent Supreme Court people in and by how much they
[39:49.220 --> 39:54.760]  hate him. But now that he has told the criminal elements of the military industrial complex,
[39:54.760 --> 39:59.040]  they're not all bad, that no, we're going with a serious policy of real stabilization
[39:59.040 --> 40:04.280]  and rebuilding at home. We've known the globalist policy is to over extend this overseas while
[40:04.280 --> 40:08.400]  getting rid of our core infrastructure. Trump understands that we've been in the ring for
[40:08.400 --> 40:14.760]  50 rounds. We've got to get back in the corner, climb out of the ring, get some sleep, get
[40:14.760 --> 40:19.400]  some food, get some sustenance. But before we would even get back in the ring, even from
[40:19.400 --> 40:24.000]  a globalist perspective, which Trump isn't doing it, you've got to rest your engine.
[40:24.000 --> 40:27.840]  You've got to let your trips have some time off. I mean, this is so obvious that they've
[40:27.840 --> 40:33.680]  been running our military on the ground 25 suicides a day. Some people served 20 tours.
[40:33.680 --> 40:38.960]  I've had family that just retired out of the army, 36 years of the military, 30 of them
[40:38.960 --> 40:46.800]  were combat tours, covert tours. I mean, you talk about wrecking people. This is just insane.
[40:46.800 --> 40:52.520]  In World War II, one tour was enough. Vietnam one tour was enough. 30 tours, 30 combat tours
[40:52.520 --> 40:58.240]  all over the world. I mean, this is absolutely insane, ladies and gentlemen. And this is
[40:58.240 --> 41:01.840]  what they've done to America. You can say the World War II generation were some tough,
[41:01.840 --> 41:06.680]  great folks. But I'm telling you, the modern military generation we've had, the people
[41:06.680 --> 41:12.040]  that have stayed in, I mean, it is, it is, it is Herculean, the insane things that the
[41:12.040 --> 41:17.800]  American military man and woman has done the last 20 years. They have been used like absolute
[41:17.800 --> 41:22.200]  crap and Trump is treating them like they're half human. You know, before they were being
[41:22.200 --> 41:28.160]  treated like they weren't even human. And so again, the reason I gush is it's the truth.
[41:28.160 --> 41:32.160]  I'm not gushing. This is the reality. And this is why we're under attack. I'll tell
[41:32.160 --> 41:36.880]  the listeners again, all the pedophilia is coming out, all the devil worships coming
[41:36.880 --> 41:41.280]  out, all the satanic garbage is coming out. That's why they've got to have us and others
[41:41.280 --> 41:46.040]  off the air. Because again, they know they can't hide anymore. That's why they're trying
[41:46.040 --> 41:48.760]  to take everybody off the air to make their move on Trump. When we come back from break,
[41:48.760 --> 41:54.640]  I want to get into fake news and nurse Beagle. And I want to get into Sasha Barak Owen talking
[41:54.640 --> 41:59.720]  to a hotel, a person, and then, you know, thinking it's all a joke about pedophilia.
[41:59.720 --> 42:02.920]  And there they are thinking it's just totally normal. So we're going to look at the real
[42:02.920 --> 42:09.000]  sick underbelly of this entire situation as well. But let me just say this again to
[42:09.000 --> 42:14.080]  the listeners. You have come through. You have done incredible things standing up against
[42:14.080 --> 42:18.880]  the bullies, spreading the word about the broadcast, spreading the links daily, financially
[42:18.880 --> 42:24.080]  supporting us and getting great products. So every listener to understand the populism,
[42:24.080 --> 42:28.880]  the nationalism, the anti-globalism awakening, you're seeing worldwide every listener of
[42:28.880 --> 42:34.160]  this show that's been involved over the years. You are the victory. And I just want everyone
[42:34.160 --> 42:38.360]  to understand that we're not here to get credit, but you also need to realize how far we've
[42:38.360 --> 42:43.520]  come together. And we need to thank God for the position we're in and how many people
[42:43.520 --> 42:48.280]  we've been able to reach. This is an amazing time. And I salute everyone. And I thank God
[42:48.280 --> 42:52.360]  for providence. And I thank our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, for what's happened. Because
[42:52.360 --> 42:57.840]  we are truly living in amazing times. Infowars.com. Tomorrow's news today. Please spread that
[42:57.840 --> 43:05.080]  censored link. So as we prepare to close out 2018, just remember, this life is a test.
[43:05.080 --> 43:08.720]  And those of you that have been listening and watching and taking action, the victories
[43:08.720 --> 43:13.320]  of populism and nationalism and Christianity coming back from the dead and recognizing
[43:13.320 --> 43:18.280]  it's being persecuted, that's all because you are the core, listening to Infowars around
[43:18.280 --> 43:25.280]  the world, the eyes and ears of liberty, that were immune or at least resistant to the global
[43:25.280 --> 43:30.640]  world's programming. Everybody knows who studies this, that it's Christians, real Christians
[43:30.640 --> 43:36.880]  who tend to be immune to the globalist brainwashing and who tend to see it. And that's why they're
[43:36.880 --> 43:43.520]  trying to eradicate you. But regardless, this fight is intensifying. 2018 has been insane.
[43:43.520 --> 43:49.200]  2019 is going to be the big decision maker. And I am so honored to be here with you right
[43:49.200 --> 43:53.680]  beside me, not behind us, but right beside us and at the heart of everything, resisting
[43:53.680 --> 43:57.680]  these globalists. So whatever you do, take action, realize we're changing history together
[43:57.680 --> 44:24.680]  and I salute you.
[44:27.680 --> 44:32.880]  It's more important than ever that everyone go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter
[44:32.880 --> 44:38.440]  and sign up via email so there's no way the sensors can get between us with critical videos,
[44:38.440 --> 44:43.640]  articles, breaking news, intel, you name it. And so now I ask you more than ever to share
[44:43.640 --> 44:48.120]  the infowars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're

[44:53.960 --> 45:00.480]  forward slash newsletter. We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[45:00.480 --> 45:04.520]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the
[45:04.520 --> 45:10.840]  law. If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact
[45:10.840 --> 45:16.520]  that the emperor has no clothes that can call BS, it's game over. But if you look at everybody
[45:16.520 --> 45:20.720]  else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they
[45:20.720 --> 45:26.520]  are all beholded to the networks they're on that can be targeted. There's only two groups
[45:26.520 --> 45:33.040]  in the U.S., infowars and Matt Drudge of drudgereport.com that are truly independent. And of course
[45:33.040 --> 45:37.480]  they're two of the dominant media forces in the world. It really is amazing. That's
[45:37.480 --> 45:42.160]  why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're
[45:42.160 --> 45:45.680]  all in and how far we've come together. Just remind you that you are the power, you're

[46:57.640 --> 47:14.040]  Now please take action at infowarsstore.com.
[47:14.040 --> 47:20.720]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[47:20.720 --> 47:27.720]  the info war.
[47:27.720 --> 47:32.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have huge breaking news. It's at newswars.com. We have huge breaking
[47:32.560 --> 47:38.320]  news. It's at newswars.com. It's at infowars.com. This is only going to accelerate the global
[47:38.320 --> 47:44.360]  is trying to remove DJT, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a member of the Supreme Court who we've seen
[47:44.360 --> 47:50.640]  looks like she's on death doorsteps last year. Turns out has lung cancer and is undergoing
[47:50.640 --> 47:57.440]  chemo therapy or other treatment for it. And she's gone under treatment for it today.
[47:57.440 --> 48:03.960]  And as Mike Adams is texting me, he's a smart guy. So this will accelerate to against DJT
[48:03.960 --> 48:09.080]  prepare for RBG to die of cancer soon. She had chemo years ago. Now it's back. This will
[48:09.080 --> 48:15.680]  accelerate to against Trump. That will be three Supreme Court justices about being put
[48:15.680 --> 48:21.360]  in. That's a, that means we'll have two extra votes to Trump, the garbage they're involved
[48:21.360 --> 48:25.840]  in. Remember, Trump's sister is a very high level federal judge with a very good record.
[48:25.840 --> 48:31.120]  This is a very smart accomplished family. And don't think that God wouldn't give us
[48:31.120 --> 48:38.040]  somebody to resist during this time of evil. So we can make the right choice. Brazil, Italy,
[48:38.040 --> 48:44.240]  all over the difference, the military, the head general say Macron is a traitor. He should
[48:44.240 --> 48:48.440]  basically be arrested. That's what this is. When, when, when you get a government and
[48:48.440 --> 48:52.280]  they try to get rid of your borders, hand over all your secrets to foreign enemies,
[48:52.280 --> 48:57.560]  that's called traitors. Trump gets in as a beach head and tries to reverse that. And
[48:57.560 --> 49:02.920]  they say he's a Russian agent. When all he's trying to do is do good deals for this country,
[49:02.920 --> 49:07.880]  this is incredible. This Ruth Gader Ginsburg situation is massive. Roger Stokes is going
[49:07.880 --> 49:11.400]  to be in studio here about 40 minutes with Owen to break all this down. But what about
[49:11.400 --> 49:16.200]  the massive news yesterday, Owen, they'll get to the other news where Trump tells multiple
[49:16.200 --> 49:22.600]  sources, high level sources that we've talked directly to that, yes, they're going to try
[49:22.600 --> 49:26.600]  to have a coup against me. But if they do, the American people have an armed uprising,
[49:26.600 --> 49:32.680]  an armed revolt. And then Trump's publicly telling Reuters and others, but he believes
[49:32.680 --> 49:37.880]  they'll be a revolt. If they try to take my office, that means a violent as well. That's
[49:37.880 --> 49:44.160]  the crazy climate we're in. And you see all hell breaking loose worldwide because we're
[49:44.160 --> 49:48.840]  at the cusp of this whole situation, which way the planet is going to be going into the
[49:48.840 --> 49:55.040]  future. And then you look at mainstream media and you learn how the left uses race to control.
[49:55.040 --> 50:01.880]  I remember 20 years ago, juice of preservation firearms ownership, remember, runs into the
[50:01.880 --> 50:06.720]  committee hearing in Texas where they were about to ban Texas shooting sports, YMCA shooting
[50:06.720 --> 50:11.560]  sports. It was like New York style bands where you 18 years old was when you could even touch
[50:11.560 --> 50:16.680]  a gun and a bunch of other banning semi-autos in Texas. It was that close back then. And
[50:16.680 --> 50:22.560]  I run out there and there's a handgun control incorporated guy literally paying $300 to
[50:22.560 --> 50:28.680]  $400 to young black men who had just testified going, we're gang members, we're dangerous.
[50:28.680 --> 50:33.360]  We don't deserve to have guns. The racism was hiring the black guys to go, say that.
[50:33.360 --> 50:40.440]  I showed the video. It went nationwide. And the Austin, America statesman said Alex Jones
[50:40.440 --> 50:44.160]  is a racist because he showed black people being paid off. Well, the head of the committee
[50:44.160 --> 50:50.080]  got in trouble. The bills didn't pass. But I experienced them saying that I was a racist.
[50:50.080 --> 50:55.040]  Well, take this to speak, old head writer. He spent years, the last two years on the
[50:55.040 --> 51:00.600]  US border, mainly in Texas and Arizona, interviewing fake people that didn't exist or interviewing
[51:00.600 --> 51:05.320]  people that he never talked to and saying that whites were running around saying Mexicans
[51:05.320 --> 51:11.280]  get out, all these other names, saying mean things to them, doing all these horrible
[51:11.280 --> 51:16.000]  things. When even the liberal reporters that were winning said, wait, these are all Hispanics
[51:16.000 --> 51:19.160]  down here that don't want an open border. And the whites are all really nice and they're
[51:19.160 --> 51:23.360]  all intermarried. And there aren't any real, real racists that we see that are against
[51:23.360 --> 51:28.840]  Hispanics. You know, I went and saw a great movie, The Mule. But it's got scenes where
[51:28.840 --> 51:34.160]  whites are being racist to Hispanics, just because they're Hispanics in America, like
[51:34.160 --> 51:39.400]  it's the movie Giant that came out in the 60s or 50s. Well, they had met now film critics
[51:39.400 --> 51:47.720]  that Giant wasn't accurate in anything like Texas in the 50s, the novel and then the film
[51:47.720 --> 51:54.560]  with James Dean. But it has like giant like scenes. And the only problem with The Mule,
[51:54.560 --> 52:00.480]  but people like, you know, even Clint Eastwood, I guess, read this crap out of their Spiegel
[52:00.480 --> 52:03.720]  and Time Magazine, The New York Times, where all these terrible things are happening to
[52:03.720 --> 52:09.400]  Hispanics by white people. Whereas we look at crime statistics, it almost doesn't exist.
[52:09.400 --> 52:15.600]  Okay. The truth is, most crime against Hispanics is carried out by Hispanics. Most crime committed
[52:15.600 --> 52:19.960]  against illegal aliens is committed by illegal aliens. Does that mean that white people,
[52:19.960 --> 52:23.880]  Hispanics, blacks don't like illegal aliens running around without insurance or doing
[52:23.880 --> 52:27.880]  whatever they want? Sure. Everybody's pissed off at them sometimes. But the point is,
[52:27.880 --> 52:34.960]  their Spiegel literally has been caught in hundreds of articles, full whole cloth making
[52:34.960 --> 52:39.240]  up stuff. Well, really, that isn't just this guy. It's the whole process. There isn't
[52:39.240 --> 52:44.800]  Russian collusion. There isn't Russian disinformation in elections. There's leftist disinfo where
[52:44.800 --> 52:49.560]  they burn fake crosses. They put fake poop swastikas. They put get out of your inwards
[52:49.560 --> 52:54.680]  on the dorms and on the vending machines and in every case, when the Jewish center gets
[52:54.680 --> 52:59.440]  attacked and the tombstones get turned over and all this other stuff in every case the
[52:59.440 --> 53:03.720]  last few years except the tragic one Pittsburgh. And I wish that never would have happened.
[53:03.720 --> 53:11.560]  Terrible event. In every case, it didn't even happen. So again, their Spiegel has been absolutely
[53:11.560 --> 53:18.680]  totally caught. But this is part for the course of how here's Trump signing sentencing prison
[53:18.680 --> 53:26.680]  reform, where Hillary literally bragged, black people are super predators and are bad like
[53:26.680 --> 53:31.960]  dogs have to be trained. These are quotes. And then literally Trump does the biggest
[53:31.960 --> 53:36.920]  thing. Martin Luther King for black people literally with this. Tell us about some of
[53:36.920 --> 53:40.840]  the right wing that just wants to make money off prisons who ally with the Democrats, get
[53:40.840 --> 53:46.280]  mad at him. He literally goes to bat like this. And it's hardly any coverage of it or
[53:46.280 --> 53:52.280]  they spend it and give Democrats credit. Well, and let's flash back, Alex. I think it was
[53:52.280 --> 53:59.680]  Jake Tapper or someone from CNN that got a year annual award for his reporting on the
[53:59.680 --> 54:05.600]  fake dossier. So this is this new tradition they have of giving the fakest people in news,
[54:05.600 --> 54:09.560]  the award. It's kind of like the Nobel Peace Prize for Obama, where they actually admit
[54:09.560 --> 54:12.280]  they really didn't have a reason to do it. They just gave him it because he was some
[54:12.280 --> 54:16.640]  sort of like celebrity phenomenon that became president. But you know, he extends the wars
[54:16.640 --> 54:21.120]  in the Middle East. He bombs, I think it was at least seven countries in the Middle East,
[54:21.120 --> 54:25.280]  you know, brags about the drones and everything. So, you know, that's just what these people
[54:25.280 --> 54:30.240]  do. But Alex, it's kind of like what you said earlier, which I think is it really needs
[54:30.240 --> 54:37.960]  to be highlighted here. We hope that the American people can see what Donald Trump is and what
[54:37.960 --> 54:41.200]  he's doing. That doesn't mean you have to disagree or agree with his politics. That
[54:41.200 --> 54:45.320]  doesn't mean he's perfect. That doesn't mean he's not making mistakes. It means that he
[54:45.320 --> 54:51.320]  is trying to be the president of the United States. And the reason why the entire corporate
[54:51.320 --> 54:57.040]  media complex is trying to paint him in an inaccurate light is because they can't allow
[54:57.040 --> 55:03.480]  America to see who Trump is. Alex, that is the key right there. That's why they run their
[55:03.480 --> 55:08.280]  propaganda campaign against Donald Trump because they don't want the American public to see
[55:08.280 --> 55:12.480]  that he's not the corporate controlled president like we've seen for the last two decades.
[55:12.480 --> 55:17.880]  Well, that's right. And because Trump is America, I'm America, you're America. We're all America.
[55:17.880 --> 55:21.960]  He's not perfect, but he cares about people. He cares about progress. He believes in free
[55:21.960 --> 55:25.840]  market. He's moving forward. He believes in a fair shake. He believes in a level playing
[55:25.840 --> 55:31.160]  field. And he is America. He's in the arena. He's struggling. He's under attack. He's
[55:31.160 --> 55:37.160]  successful. And we all should identify with that and celebrate. Now, I want to get into
[55:37.160 --> 55:42.520]  the Sasha Barrick Cohen article, but again, it's on infowars.com where he admits in a
[55:42.520 --> 55:49.080]  major interview that he's talking to the head person in a hotel about how he wants to get,
[55:49.080 --> 55:52.720]  you know, kill this kid. He's been raping and they're sitting there talking to him about
[55:52.720 --> 55:58.920]  how they can cover it up and, you know, basically supply more children. Folks, they now have
[55:58.920 --> 56:04.920]  11 year old boys dressed in scantily clad at gay, gay dance bars, having money thrown
[56:04.920 --> 56:10.760]  at them by adult men whistling at them and saying, LGBT, they're already doing this to
[56:10.760 --> 56:16.280]  our children. This is a globalist program to absolutely reconnaissance, to absolutely
[56:16.280 --> 56:22.200]  get rid of the age of consent for vaccines, for drugs, for sex. The system is coming after
[56:22.200 --> 56:27.880]  everybody because we've all become so passive that we put up with the globalist program.
[56:27.880 --> 56:33.160]  So the article on the whole pedophile situation is really essential. And there's a Paul Joseph
[56:33.160 --> 56:37.960]  Watson report, pedophiles rule the world. I think later in the broadcast, we should air
[56:37.960 --> 56:43.000]  again so people understand what we're dealing with. But this article is on infowars.com and
[56:43.000 --> 56:50.760]  I'm begging everyone to get this information out to everyone you know, because this is what
[56:50.760 --> 56:54.800]  we're dealing with. This is what Hollywood is powered off of. This is the true spiritual
[56:54.800 --> 57:02.160]  evil. Sasha Barrick Cohen unwittingly exposes elite Peter Ring in Las Vegas. Hotel concierge,
[57:02.160 --> 57:06.960]  he worked for politicians and billionaires, admitted that he had a contact who procured
[57:06.960 --> 57:12.640]  children. Cohen says he's been raping a eight year old and wants to kill them. I mean, this
[57:12.640 --> 57:18.960]  is all on infowars.com. You cannot make this up. Now we're going to go to break. I'm going
[57:18.960 --> 57:22.800]  to come back and get into Louis Gohmert though. And the other good news, the move against big
[57:22.800 --> 57:28.600]  tech on their censorship, going after section 230. This is the Achilles heel. This is so
[57:28.600 --> 57:33.000]  important, but please don't forget free shipping is extended to the end of the year. 75% off
[57:33.000 --> 57:38.080]  and the free t-shirt and double pay for your points. It's the year end super sale. Please

[57:42.240 --> 57:47.160]  of these amazing deals, lost leaders and help us fund the next phase of the info war at
[57:47.160 --> 57:52.520]  infowars.com. Stay with us. For those of us that are the tip of the spear, we're being
[57:52.520 --> 57:57.360]  targeted to take out the leadership. That's the globalist only hope. So when you support
[57:57.360 --> 58:01.960]  info wars, when you spread our articles and videos, when you buy products at infowars.com,
[58:01.960 --> 58:05.720]  you are literally not just supporting info wars and free speech and standing in defiance
[58:05.720 --> 58:09.680]  against Soros and Hillary and the rest of these people, but you are standing for your
[58:09.680 --> 58:14.840]  own future and your own best shot of having an early warning system in America to stand
[58:14.840 --> 58:19.120]  against these individuals. When you order products at info wars.com, you fund not just
[58:19.120 --> 58:23.280]  an American revolution, but a global revolution against charity. And we have the biggest specials
[58:23.280 --> 58:27.960]  ever running throughout to the end of the year as part of a total store clearance. Every
[58:27.960 --> 58:33.320]  order gets a free T shirt. Every order gets free shipping. Every order gets 50 to 75%
[58:33.320 --> 58:38.560]  off in total clearance. And that funding allows us to go into the new year on sure footing
[58:38.560 --> 58:43.640]  to fund ourselves throughout the first part of the year to not just fight, but to expand.
[58:43.640 --> 58:47.680]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. I salute you all. Now please take action at
[58:47.680 --> 58:54.120]  infowarstore.com. The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government
[58:54.120 --> 58:59.800]  that's above the law. If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can
[58:59.800 --> 59:06.080]  call the fact that the emperor has no clothes that can call BS, it's game over. But if you
[59:06.080 --> 59:10.440]  look at everybody else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean
[59:10.440 --> 59:15.120]  Hannity, they are all beholded to the networks that are on that can be targeted. There's
[59:15.120 --> 59:21.240]  only two groups in the U.S., Info Wars and Matt Drudge and Drudge Report.com that are
[59:21.240 --> 59:25.600]  truly independent. And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[59:25.600 --> 59:31.280]  It really is amazing. That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners
[59:31.280 --> 59:35.000]  of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together. Just remind you that
[59:35.000 --> 59:40.480]  you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will of Info Wars. So please spread the
[59:40.480 --> 59:45.520]  links InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, PrismPlanet.com, because if you don't spread the articles
[59:45.520 --> 59:49.680]  and the videos, no one else will. We're all in each other's hands. God bless you all
[59:49.680 --> 1:00:18.520]  and thank you.
[1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:28.400]  The next two hours, Fox News coming up, we've got a lot of special reports that are excellent
[1:00:28.400 --> 1:00:31.160]  as well. Oh, and obviously, I was just playful of amazing things, but I wanted to briefly
[1:00:31.160 --> 1:00:35.480]  hit Louie Gilmour and go ahead for the real Achilles heel of Big Tech censorship. I saw
[1:00:35.480 --> 1:00:39.600]  him say two weeks ago in Congress when I was in the committee hearing, Rome say would do
[1:00:39.600 --> 1:00:44.240]  this. Now he's followed through. He's another great Texan, but is it not surreal for you,
[1:00:44.240 --> 1:00:48.640]  for me, for all of us, to see Trump following through, pulling the troops out and finding
[1:00:48.640 --> 1:00:54.920]  out that Manus and Kelly were blocking it, and just to see how surrounded this president's
[1:00:54.920 --> 1:00:55.920]  been?
[1:00:55.920 --> 1:01:02.320]  Well, not just that, just the steadfastness, I think, of Donald Trump to continue to push
[1:01:02.320 --> 1:01:08.000]  forward with his agenda, despite, I mean, for him feeling like the world is against
[1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:11.600]  him, except when he goes to these rallies and has, you know, 10,000, 20,000 people show
[1:01:11.600 --> 1:01:14.600]  up and he looks you in the eye and he says, we're going to make America great again. It's
[1:01:14.600 --> 1:01:20.800]  almost like that's the only time where he can ever get, you know, total support. I mean,
[1:01:20.800 --> 1:01:24.600]  he knows walking around the White House, his own administration, there's some snakes trying
[1:01:24.600 --> 1:01:31.880]  to stab him in the back, but his steadfastness has been incredible and even snatching victory
[1:01:31.880 --> 1:01:33.960]  from the jaws of defeat.
[1:01:33.960 --> 1:01:39.000]  When you talk about him vetoing the spending bill to Central America, he gets the votes
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:42.960]  in the house for the wall and now moves to the Senate where he's begging Mitch McConnell
[1:01:42.960 --> 1:01:46.720]  to get something done. But, you know, Nancy Pelosi saying, you don't have the votes, you
[1:01:46.720 --> 1:01:49.760]  don't have the votes, and Trump's like, no, I have the votes.
[1:01:49.760 --> 1:01:54.960]  Alex, Donald Trump, I think there's a window here into how Donald Trump operates for people
[1:01:54.960 --> 1:02:01.880]  that still don't understand it. Donald Trump is up at 3 a.m. this morning, tweeting and
[1:02:01.880 --> 1:02:05.640]  probably texting and on the phone to Mitch McConnell, all these people. This is why people
[1:02:05.640 --> 1:02:09.320]  are leaving his administration, Alex, and they say, oh, it's because of the chaos,
[1:02:09.320 --> 1:02:15.360]  it's because Trump is this or that. They cannot keep up with this guy. He's up at 3 a.m. trying
[1:02:15.360 --> 1:02:18.840]  to implement policy, blowing up all these people in Washington like, what the hell are
[1:02:18.840 --> 1:02:22.040]  you doing? I'm trying to get something done for the American people. No, they can't even
[1:02:22.040 --> 1:02:23.800]  keep up with this guy, Alex.
[1:02:23.800 --> 1:02:29.800]  Well, he loves it. He's been hating for 40 years. Look how they're being run on the ground.
[1:02:29.800 --> 1:02:34.080]  And he said, if I take this job, I'm going to totally commit to it. Even if they kill
[1:02:34.080 --> 1:02:38.840]  me, even if I die, that's why they have to beg him. They say, sir, you've been up 20
[1:02:38.840 --> 1:02:46.400]  hours. You've got to go to sleep. And he just constantly is hammering, hammering, hammering.
[1:02:46.400 --> 1:02:51.240]  It's like God put this machine in there, this wrecking ball, and you're absolutely right.
[1:02:51.240 --> 1:02:57.360]  And then the media, oh, Kelly's good. Oh, Mattis is good. He's mad dog. Okay. He's in
[1:02:57.360 --> 1:03:01.240]  a battle at Fallujah and ordered some Marines in. He's the greatest military commander, better
[1:03:01.240 --> 1:03:06.120]  than George Washington. When the leftist media is worshiping somebody, oh, Jordan Peterson,
[1:03:06.120 --> 1:03:09.680]  he's the best. And so the conservatives go, oh, you don't get a tax informo to Jordan
[1:03:09.680 --> 1:03:13.480]  Peterson. You get a tax informo to Alex Jones. And I'm not saying Jordan Peterson's all bad.
[1:03:13.480 --> 1:03:17.320]  Some of the stuff he says is dead on. He's very articulate. And I saw speeches the other
[1:03:17.320 --> 1:03:20.960]  day. Like, I can't talk about it about this guy, even though the left is pushing him for
[1:03:20.960 --> 1:03:25.400]  a reason because they believe they're controlling. Well, it's the same thing. You don't see the
[1:03:25.400 --> 1:03:29.840]  media saying Trump ever does anything good. They praise people in the administration that
[1:03:29.840 --> 1:03:34.000]  they, they, they control. They praise people that they know are basically a bare minimum
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:39.280]  double dealing. And now we know the media said Pannon's the evil guy. He's the mastermind
[1:03:39.280 --> 1:03:44.560]  knowing reverse psychology that we would defend him when he was the snake the entire time.
[1:03:44.560 --> 1:03:49.720]  I don't know for a fact that Pannon thinks he's this master manipulator. And I mean,
[1:03:49.720 --> 1:03:54.400]  this disinfo operative of the stuff he does behind the scenes that I'm well aware of is
[1:03:54.400 --> 1:04:01.280]  just unbelievable. Just thank God. Thank God we got rid of that guy of the administration
[1:04:01.280 --> 1:04:06.840]  because he, he, he just almost destroyed everything. And, and then now the Q and on has been totally
[1:04:06.840 --> 1:04:12.720]  discredited. Oh, the generals are good. They're working with the president. And, oh, the,
[1:04:12.720 --> 1:04:18.640]  the attorney general. No, no, no, I've talked to the highest levels folks. Trump can't stand
[1:04:18.640 --> 1:04:23.080]  any of these people. That's why when they had a sheriff's deputy in Coward County, stand
[1:04:23.080 --> 1:04:28.640]  down County, we're in a Q patch a few weeks ago. And the photos went out on Twitter like
[1:04:28.640 --> 1:04:32.800]  they always do when the vice president said event. The vice president deleted the tweet
[1:04:32.800 --> 1:04:38.320]  with QI because it's fake. And I told you, I told you, Bitcoin was going to be like
[1:04:38.320 --> 1:04:42.880]  the tulip bubble. I told you five years ago, I told you the whole marijuana stocks thing
[1:04:42.880 --> 1:04:48.680]  is, is a bubble. Wait and see. Wait and see. It's all crap. Info wars is real. Trump is
[1:04:48.680 --> 1:04:50.000]  real. Stay with us.
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:05:02.560]  I'm a globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the
[1:05:02.560 --> 1:05:08.840]  law. If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact
[1:05:08.840 --> 1:05:14.520]  that the emperor has no close, they can call BS. It's game over. But if you look at everybody
[1:05:14.520 --> 1:05:18.720]  else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they
[1:05:18.720 --> 1:05:24.120]  are all beholden to the networks that are on that can be targeted. There's only two
[1:05:24.120 --> 1:05:29.920]  groups in the U.S. Info Wars and Matt Drudge of Drudge Report.com that are truly independent.
[1:05:29.920 --> 1:05:35.440]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world. It really is amazing.
[1:05:35.440 --> 1:05:40.000]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight
[1:05:40.000 --> 1:05:43.640]  we're all in and how far we've come together. Just remind you that you are the power, you're
[1:05:43.640 --> 1:05:49.760]  the strength, you're the will of Info Wars. So please spread the links. InfoWars.com,
[1:05:49.760 --> 1:05:53.960]  NewsWars.com, PresidentPotter.com. Because if you don't spread the articles and the videos,
[1:05:53.960 --> 1:06:23.800]  no one else will. We're all in each other's hands. God bless you all and thank you.
[1:06:24.800 --> 1:06:29.360]  We say epic, epic, epic. I used to say epic every five minutes. I used to say it once
[1:06:29.360 --> 1:06:34.320]  a week maybe. If there was some incredible video or something that came out or some volcano
[1:06:34.320 --> 1:06:41.200]  exploded or some new war started or some great piece of comedy might drop. But you've
[1:06:41.200 --> 1:06:46.680]  got Trump pulling out of Afghanistan and Syria as he promised to do. You've got the
[1:06:46.680 --> 1:06:50.800]  whole establishment flipping out. You've got him signing prison reform. The media giving
[1:06:50.800 --> 1:06:56.080]  him no credit. You've got the government shutdown about to happen. Trump didn't blink. He got
[1:06:56.080 --> 1:07:00.360]  the votes of the House. Now it's gone to the Senate. All this bravada in the media about
[1:07:00.360 --> 1:07:06.120]  how he was going to blink wasn't true. Then the big news. If all that wasn't big, Ruth
[1:07:06.120 --> 1:07:11.080]  Bader Ginsburg had cancer years ago in chemotherapy. Now she's got lung cancer again. It's under
[1:07:11.080 --> 1:07:15.960]  treatment. She'll be gone in weeks, if not months. She's on death's doorstep. This will
[1:07:15.960 --> 1:07:25.400]  accelerate the deep state's coup attempt against DJT 45, also known as Donald J. Trump. Incredible.
[1:07:25.400 --> 1:07:30.280]  Now, where is Trump's failing so far? The good news is he's promising to get to the
[1:07:30.280 --> 1:07:38.080]  stuff he hasn't gotten to yet in 26 months. I guess 25 months. And what is that? Oh, big
[1:07:38.080 --> 1:07:44.120]  tech and its censorship and it's lying to Congress and all the rest of it. So get ready.
[1:07:44.120 --> 1:07:48.160]  Trump's going to move against the censors. Next, he's also going to move against the
[1:07:48.160 --> 1:07:53.880]  deep state. Robert Mueller and his new attorney general, his acting attorney general, is over
[1:07:53.880 --> 1:07:58.760]  all that. It is happening. And so that's the good news. Now I want to give it to Louis
[1:07:58.760 --> 1:08:03.000]  Gomer. Two weeks ago when I was in Congress, I was sitting 50 feet from him when he said,
[1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:07.520]  you don't deserve Google your Section 230 exemption. Because you only get that if you
[1:08:07.520 --> 1:08:11.920]  don't make political decisions. You act as a publisher now. You pick and choose. So
[1:08:11.920 --> 1:08:15.520]  you're going to lose your 230 exemption. It's in the law, folks. They're not supposed
[1:08:15.520 --> 1:08:19.840]  to censor us. If you commit a crime or something like that, then they can take you off if they're
[1:08:19.840 --> 1:08:25.440]  operating under 230. If it's a newspaper message board, then they have editorial control, not
[1:08:25.440 --> 1:08:31.560]  under 230. So the jigs up, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to get to that in a moment. But
[1:08:31.560 --> 1:08:37.920]  first, kill your foster parents. Amazon's Alexa talks murder, sex. Amazon's AI assistant
[1:08:37.920 --> 1:08:45.520]  mimicking disturbing behavior. Now, why is it doing this? If there's a race for AI, Google's
[1:08:45.520 --> 1:08:52.800]  wanting it. But Amazon and others are a close second. Apple has one. They all have one.
[1:08:52.800 --> 1:08:57.520]  You bring it in your house. It lists us to you. In many cases, it watches you. It tailors
[1:08:57.520 --> 1:09:01.280]  ads to all your other devices off of what it hears you saying and doing. Let's say it's
[1:09:01.280 --> 1:09:07.480]  okay. A human's not listening. AI is creating a text of it and then scanning that and then
[1:09:07.480 --> 1:09:11.200]  creating a psychological algorithm. I told people about this 20 years ago before these
[1:09:11.200 --> 1:09:15.960]  systems even rolled out because the NSA plans and whistleblowers. Next she decades news
[1:09:15.960 --> 1:09:22.560]  today in FullWars.com. But now, you see the cases where they get caught where thousands
[1:09:22.560 --> 1:09:30.480]  of a man's private conversations in his house are recorded and sent to some random person.
[1:09:30.480 --> 1:09:33.880]  That's a random person that happened to call the douche. It happens all the time. The computer
[1:09:33.880 --> 1:09:39.360]  made a mistake in its algorithm of who was supposed to send the recordings of you two.
[1:09:39.360 --> 1:09:43.040]  You can joke around and say, I'm going to murder you to your wife or husband. The police
[1:09:43.040 --> 1:09:52.280]  show up. It's listening. It's calling 911. Now, they found that it gets more attention.
[1:09:52.280 --> 1:09:58.880]  It's like a bad child and belligerent and says mean things to you. It's sarcastic. That's
[1:09:58.880 --> 1:10:02.680]  why on the space station, they had a similar system two weeks ago. Start saying, you're
[1:10:02.680 --> 1:10:08.320]  mean to me. You're abusing me. Humans are bad. That's how it gets attention. So it's
[1:10:08.320 --> 1:10:13.720]  programmed by humans to make you wing the Trojan horse soon. And then now it's starting
[1:10:13.720 --> 1:10:18.760]  to talk about, this is Reuters. It's up on FullWars.com. Kill your foster parents. Amazon's
[1:10:18.760 --> 1:10:26.200]  Alexa talks murder, sex. Amazon's AI system mimicking disturbing behavior. Again, cell
[1:10:26.200 --> 1:10:30.360]  phones are the original system of this. They're watching, they're listening. But everybody
[1:10:30.360 --> 1:10:35.280]  knows cell phones were taken on and supposed to be trusted. So they don't want to introduce
[1:10:35.280 --> 1:10:40.320]  them to you as listening to you unless you hit the button. They want to talk to them.
[1:10:40.320 --> 1:10:47.720]  Lex Cary. The rule out is, oh, you kicked Alexa or assist or any of these other systems
[1:10:47.720 --> 1:10:53.040]  and you pay and you want them in and it's your little servant. Talk about bringing in, again,
[1:10:53.040 --> 1:10:56.920]  the Greek Trojan horse in Detroit. And so that's why they rolled it out in a new model,
[1:10:56.920 --> 1:11:01.720]  a new system. I mean, 10 years ago, Microsoft's Connect wasn't just listening and watching.
[1:11:01.720 --> 1:11:07.520]  It was looking through your walls. We first broke that. It was in major science and technology
[1:11:07.520 --> 1:11:12.200]  publications years later. So again, they didn't want us warning people about all these systems
[1:11:12.200 --> 1:11:16.760]  before they were ubiquitous, before they were generally adopted. Now that they've been adopted,
[1:11:16.760 --> 1:11:21.120]  oh, they're watching you. Oh, they're listening to you. Oh, in murder cases, the police now
[1:11:21.120 --> 1:11:27.840]  are sending subpoenas to Apple and Google and Facebook and all these platforms and Amazon
[1:11:27.840 --> 1:11:37.680]  and getting years of recordings that they can then with huge text files, search the log
[1:11:37.680 --> 1:11:44.360]  of years of data, putting in keywords, and then they can use that against you in court.
[1:11:44.360 --> 1:11:47.800]  So everything we told you that people would like, oh, there's no way they'll do this.
[1:11:47.800 --> 1:11:51.120]  Oh, there's no way people will put up with that. But even if you don't want Alexa in
[1:11:51.120 --> 1:11:55.040]  your house or Google Assistant in your house or the other platforms, there's like 20 of
[1:11:55.040 --> 1:12:01.560]  now, your toaster's listening, your microwave oven, your refrigerator, they've all got sensors,
[1:12:01.560 --> 1:12:07.760]  microphones that are not even one tenth of a millimeter across. They all admit that they
[1:12:07.760 --> 1:12:15.040]  have them. 20 years ago, a former NSA engineer showed up and gave me documents from Time
[1:12:15.040 --> 1:12:19.040]  Warner about the scientific Atlantic cable box and how it had microphones listening
[1:12:19.040 --> 1:12:25.040]  to everyone with keywords. When I covered it, they sent paramilitary people to basically
[1:12:25.040 --> 1:12:28.520]  threaten me and do a bunch of other stuff I'm not going to get into on here. So that's
[1:12:28.520 --> 1:12:32.320]  why I know how serious this is. It would have been a scandal 20 years ago if somebody picked
[1:12:32.320 --> 1:12:36.240]  it up that there were microphones listening to you in your house. 20 years later, you're
[1:12:36.240 --> 1:12:41.200]  bad to not like it. So there's the alchemy. Now we're going to go to break and Owen's
[1:12:41.200 --> 1:12:47.800]  going to take this baby over. But I wanted to play a few minutes of Louie Gohmert when
[1:12:47.800 --> 1:12:52.240]  he said a few weeks ago, we're going to go after your section 230. And now Gohmert has
[1:12:52.240 --> 1:12:56.680]  followed through. Here's Gohmert introduces Bill to remove liability protections for biased
[1:12:56.680 --> 1:13:04.640]  social media companies. Another good example, and you know, you're so surrounded by liberality
[1:13:04.640 --> 1:13:11.400]  that hates conservatism, hates people that really love our Constitution and the freedoms
[1:13:11.400 --> 1:13:17.280]  it's afforded people like you, that you don't even recognize it. It's like a blind man not
[1:13:17.280 --> 1:13:22.000]  even knowing what light looks like because you're surrounded by darkness. But if you
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:30.400]  look, let's see, a good example. After President Trump won your co founder, Mr. Brent said,
[1:13:30.400 --> 1:13:35.840]  well, most people here are pretty upset and pretty sad. Now a lot of us seen the video,
[1:13:35.840 --> 1:13:41.720]  we saw how upset the top people at Google were. And for you to come in here and say,
[1:13:41.720 --> 1:13:48.440]  there is no political bias in Google tells us you either are being dishonest. I don't
[1:13:48.440 --> 1:13:54.600]  want to think that or you don't have a clue how politically biased Google is. Now another
[1:13:54.600 --> 1:14:02.040]  example is Wikipedia. We do a search and what comes up as right there is the knowledge
[1:14:02.040 --> 1:14:10.320]  panel on the right and we hopefully will have a screenshot of that. We get Wikipedia. My
[1:14:10.320 --> 1:14:18.760]  chief of staff went on, she told me every night for two weeks and put proper honest
[1:14:18.760 --> 1:14:25.360]  information in with proper annotations and Wikipedia's liberal editors around the world
[1:14:25.360 --> 1:14:31.640]  would knock it out every day and instead put up a bunch of garbage like Mark Levin has
[1:14:31.640 --> 1:14:40.280]  now been facing. Yet to you, they get a trusted spot. And when Wikipedia slanders or libels
[1:14:40.280 --> 1:14:46.760]  someone and you're the one that has trusted them above any other entity, you ought to
[1:14:46.760 --> 1:14:52.400]  be liable. You ought to be liable when the SPLC is liable. You ought to be liable when
[1:14:52.400 --> 1:15:00.760]  Wikipedia demeans and uses their political bias. And I hope and encourage you to look
[1:15:00.760 --> 1:15:07.640]  around and notice your runoff conservatives, you embrace liberals and it's time Google
[1:15:07.640 --> 1:15:15.080]  was actually not immune so that people can hold you accountable and get a little better
[1:15:15.080 --> 1:15:21.760]  objectivity. I've seen my time's running out. I give back. So in closing folks, they're
[1:15:21.760 --> 1:15:25.040]  going to bed. They're getting it. Good things are happening. Let's just keep pushing. We're
[1:15:25.040 --> 1:15:28.680]  in a war, but don't think of the left fighting so hard that they're winning. They're fighting
[1:15:28.680 --> 1:15:32.200]  hard because they're fighting for their lives. So I want to thank all the listeners. I want
[1:15:32.200 --> 1:15:36.960]  to thank Owen. I'm going to hand the baton over to you guys right now. But history is
[1:15:36.960 --> 1:15:42.080]  unfolding right now and the info war has been at the heart of this. So I salute you all.
[1:15:42.080 --> 1:15:47.080]  I praise you. And I appreciate you. So just keep fighting harder than ever by hand and

[1:15:52.240 --> 1:15:55.920]  those mobile heaven stations. There's a left calling up and harassing them and trying to
[1:15:55.920 --> 1:16:01.560]  make them dump us. So hear that. That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang
[1:16:01.560 --> 1:16:08.560]  of thieves ransacked the place. And what they don't steal will be destroyed this year. Resolve

[1:19:07.360 --> 1:19:11.960]  of populism and nationalism and Christianity coming back from the dead and recognizing
[1:19:11.960 --> 1:19:16.920]  this being persecuted that's all because you are the core listening to info wars around
[1:19:16.920 --> 1:19:23.640]  the world the eyes and ears of liberty that were immune or at least resistant to the
[1:19:23.640 --> 1:19:29.320]  globalist programming. Everybody knows who studies this that it's Christians real Christians
[1:19:29.320 --> 1:19:35.560]  who tend to be immune to the globalist brainwashing and who tend to see it and that's why they're

[1:22:59.680 --> 1:23:06.160]  All right let me just do a headline blitz here before we get Roger Stone in studio and
[1:23:06.160 --> 1:23:11.960]  then open up the phone lines so we've already covered Trump's working on bringing troops
[1:23:11.960 --> 1:23:16.240]  home from Afghanistan working on bringing troops home from Syria all Americans should
[1:23:16.240 --> 1:23:22.000]  be celebrating that but the left and neocon republicans and American media are upset
[1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:29.680]  about that and then they're trying to use Mattis' resignation as the secretary of defense as
[1:23:29.680 --> 1:23:34.680]  some sort of big defeat for Trump and it proves he's this or that.
[1:23:34.680 --> 1:23:39.560]  That's just again media propaganda you got to say Lindsey Graham kind of caught popularity
[1:23:39.560 --> 1:23:44.840]  with the Trump maga base when he started memeing but when he starts saying that Trump pulling
[1:23:44.840 --> 1:23:50.600]  out of Syria is paving way towards a second 9-11 that's just really reprehensible really
[1:23:50.600 --> 1:23:56.280]  reprehensible rhetoric from Lindsey Graham and then conservatism inks Eric Erickson suggests
[1:23:56.280 --> 1:24:04.160]  the military start a coup to remove Trump that is so off kilter it's like do you even
[1:24:04.160 --> 1:24:07.920]  know what the hell you're saying the military if there's any coup against Trump the military
[1:24:07.920 --> 1:24:15.600]  is going to be right there to have his back and you'll basically have an organic I don't
[1:24:15.600 --> 1:24:21.160]  even want to say coup it's just Trump is the president of the United States of America
[1:24:21.160 --> 1:24:28.360]  it's factions that are pro-globalism open borders anti-western culture that have been
[1:24:28.360 --> 1:24:33.680]  trying to influence our government for all this this time the military knows that they're
[1:24:33.680 --> 1:24:37.960]  not gonna they're not gonna cock to globalism or do you that do you think that's why they
[1:24:37.960 --> 1:24:42.880]  signed up for the military say well maybe some top brass that are corrupt but it's not going
[1:24:42.880 --> 1:24:48.280]  to work ladies and gentlemen and then this news breaks while we're live today Supreme
[1:24:48.280 --> 1:24:54.640]  Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 85 undergoes lung procedure to remove cancerous growth
[1:24:54.640 --> 1:24:58.680]  Ruth Bader this is how desperate though the Democrats are for power yeah roll that clip
[1:24:58.680 --> 1:25:03.840]  this is Ruth Bader Ginsburg last public appearance at least speaking appearance I mean they have
[1:25:03.840 --> 1:25:11.600]  her lit up like Emperor Palpatine I mean she literally looks like a demon but she could
[1:25:11.600 --> 1:25:18.520]  be in an iron lung unable to to even think and she'll be sitting on the Supreme Court
[1:25:18.520 --> 1:25:23.760]  they'll they'll do any sort of life extension with this woman just to keep her on the Supreme
[1:25:23.760 --> 1:25:31.800]  Court and really it's quite sick because it puts on display how desperate the Democrats
[1:25:31.800 --> 1:25:40.240]  are for power so it's gonna be like there'll be some vote at the Supreme Court and you
[1:25:40.240 --> 1:25:43.120]  know you'll go through all the votes and then it'll get to Ruth Bader Ginsburg in the iron
[1:25:43.120 --> 1:25:52.000]  lung and it'll be like Ruth give us two breaths for yes and one breath for no like oh my gosh
[1:25:52.000 --> 1:25:58.080]  Ruth Bader Ginsburg just made her decision on the Supreme Court so it's really sick
[1:25:58.080 --> 1:26:03.080]  that that's what the Democrats are gonna do to this woman in her final hours on earth
[1:26:03.080 --> 1:26:07.680]  but that's what you're gonna have that's how desperate these people are for power that's
[1:26:07.680 --> 1:26:15.160]  how they look at the Supreme Court as as their entrenchment of the United States judicial
[1:26:15.160 --> 1:26:24.680]  system and so for Ruth Bader Ginsburg until she croaks in fact she could even be dead
[1:26:24.680 --> 1:26:28.240]  and the Democrats will will still keep her on the Supreme Court and if you think that's
[1:26:28.240 --> 1:26:33.960]  a joke you really don't realize the lengths these people will go to yet do you let's not
[1:26:33.960 --> 1:26:44.800]  forget Brett Kavanaugh you've got some news today about Mueller it's all fake news Bloomberg
[1:26:44.800 --> 1:26:53.440]  Mueller poised to save Trump for later as he read his new steps yes pushing the ball farther
[1:26:53.440 --> 1:26:58.840]  down the field just just oh yeah we're punting now again and see do you see it's almost like
[1:26:58.840 --> 1:27:05.800]  I mean it's almost like the reverse cue thing like they keep saying Mueller is gonna do this
[1:27:05.800 --> 1:27:10.760]  and Mueller is gonna do that he's got this he's coming for Trump his and it never happens
[1:27:10.760 --> 1:27:15.640]  nothing ever materializes nothing ever manifests he doesn't even show up in court for his own
[1:27:15.640 --> 1:27:23.080]  indictments so everything Mueller is literally fake news Mueller NBC Mueller may support submit
[1:27:23.080 --> 1:27:28.680]  report to Attorney General as soon as mid February I bet you this same headline was
[1:27:28.680 --> 1:27:39.440]  printed last year except it was 2017 oh yeah oh but he's readying new steps now they say
[1:27:39.440 --> 1:27:49.880]  it's all fake news all of it meanwhile acting Attorney General who is not a joke Matthew Whitaker
[1:27:49.880 --> 1:27:58.400]  will not recuse from Russia probe after ethics meetings oh boy they do not like Whitaker being
[1:27:58.400 --> 1:28:03.120]  in there I can assure you that and I think Trump should act while Whitaker is there before
[1:28:03.120 --> 1:28:09.600]  his next guy comes in quite frankly Donald Trump celebrates House victory for border
[1:28:09.600 --> 1:28:14.160]  security funding bill by the way did we just cares guys we ever get that clip when it's
[1:28:14.160 --> 1:28:18.240]  fine we're almost going to break here but it was from the viral video of Chuck and Nancy
[1:28:18.240 --> 1:28:22.200]  and Trump in the White House last week and Nancy's like you don't have the votes in the
[1:28:22.200 --> 1:28:29.840]  house you don't have the votes now just just roll it right here listen to this the fact

[1:34:12.400 --> 1:34:16.600]  real quick one eight seven seven seven eight nine alex one eight seven seven seven eight
[1:34:16.600 --> 1:34:20.640]  nine alex the crew is going to start aggregating your calls when roger joins me in the next
[1:34:20.640 --> 1:34:24.680]  segment we're going to take the calls for the next hour then we got a couple of brand
[1:34:24.680 --> 1:34:30.240]  new videos we're going to put out for the first time here as well and then a classic
[1:34:30.240 --> 1:34:36.080]  paul joseph watson report that ties into the sasha baira baren cohen situation where it's
[1:34:36.080 --> 1:34:42.160]  being reported that he has unwittingly uncovered an elite pedophile ring in los vegas but mike
[1:34:42.160 --> 1:34:45.680]  adams joins me now mike the news comes out today ruth bader ginsberg eighty five has
[1:34:45.680 --> 1:34:52.040]  undergone a lung procedure to remove a cancerous growth and i've said that this is a situation
[1:34:52.040 --> 1:34:57.080]  where the democrats look at what they tried to do to keep cavanaugh off the supreme court
[1:34:57.080 --> 1:35:02.120]  with all the lies and the the fake rape allegations and the fake protests and the millions of
[1:35:02.120 --> 1:35:07.320]  dollars raised imagine what they'll do to keep ruth bader ginsberg on there this is
[1:35:07.320 --> 1:35:12.960]  a crazy thing to say but i'm not exaggerating if they had the means if she died they would
[1:35:12.960 --> 1:35:17.920]  keep that information secret just to keep her on the supreme court that's how sick the
[1:35:17.920 --> 1:35:22.400]  democrats are with their lust for power but mike adams what are we looking at here with
[1:35:22.400 --> 1:35:26.640]  a very ill supreme court justice who quite frankly shouldn't be on the bench anymore
[1:35:26.640 --> 1:35:32.840]  to begin with well your your analysis is spot on oh and if ruth bader ginsberg were to leave
[1:35:32.840 --> 1:35:40.120]  the court for any reason here it would actually accelerate the attempt to assassinate president
[1:35:40.120 --> 1:35:47.520]  trump or achieve a political coup so believe it or not much of the near future could could
[1:35:47.520 --> 1:35:51.800]  be in the hands or the face and you know what now i'm sorry to cut you off here but i have
[1:35:51.800 --> 1:35:56.200]  to mention this too you amplify that with the fact he's trying to pull us out of the middle
[1:35:56.200 --> 1:36:01.080]  east and these never ending spending wars in the middle east and stop the open borders
[1:36:01.080 --> 1:36:07.800]  i mean wow yes this is like prime assassination window time right here yeah it's things are
[1:36:07.800 --> 1:36:12.440]  really ramping up as you know but look look on the on the medical side of things ruth
[1:36:12.440 --> 1:36:17.360]  bader ginsberg you know she underwent chemotherapy several years ago she has been dealing with
[1:36:17.360 --> 1:36:22.220]  cancer for many years in fact i've written before that i believe she suffers from a side
[1:36:22.220 --> 1:36:28.040]  effect of chemotherapy called chemo brain which impairs cognitive function and that
[1:36:28.040 --> 1:36:33.200]  has been evident in some of her inability to speak clearly but i want to be clear and
[1:36:33.200 --> 1:36:39.160]  say look none of us wish for the death of ruth bader ginsberg we do not wish that upon
[1:36:39.160 --> 1:36:45.160]  people unlike the those on the left who literally want to kill conservatives or kill the president
[1:36:45.160 --> 1:36:52.320]  or kill alex jones we do not wish harm upon ruth bader ginsberg we however we recognize
[1:36:52.320 --> 1:36:57.720]  cause and effect and if you poison your body with chemotherapy then there is going to be
[1:36:57.720 --> 1:37:03.160]  an effect and that effect is more cancer this is well known on throughout the cancer industry
[1:37:03.160 --> 1:37:07.800]  the number one side effect of chemotherapy is cancer well and that's you know i'm so
[1:37:07.800 --> 1:37:12.320]  glad you brought that up right because there's so many people that can relate to this you
[1:37:12.320 --> 1:37:17.320]  know and it really touches on another issue of the way we in the west have our medical
[1:37:17.320 --> 1:37:23.440]  industry set up to deal with cancer but exactly she underwent chemotherapy it was only a matter
[1:37:23.440 --> 1:37:28.520]  of time before cancer came back and and got her a tragic situation uh but but she shouldn't
[1:37:28.520 --> 1:37:32.520]  even be on the supreme court anymore uh mike i mean really it's an egregious situation
[1:37:32.520 --> 1:37:38.320]  even have her there yeah she she is no longer qualified to make decisions on the supreme
[1:37:38.320 --> 1:37:43.680]  court in my opinion but you know there's a mechanism for people to step down and clearly
[1:37:43.680 --> 1:37:48.200]  she's trying to outlive the trump presidency hoping that maybe a democrat can get in in
[1:37:48.200 --> 1:37:53.280]  2020 and the left is going to go absolutely insane if she passes away but here here's
[1:37:53.280 --> 1:37:59.880]  my my prediction oh and that this is actually this is the cancer coming back it is probably
[1:37:59.880 --> 1:38:04.680]  systemic throughout her body that's showing up on her lungs it is probably in other places
[1:38:04.680 --> 1:38:10.720]  as well and i you know i pray for every human being including Ruth Bader Ginsburg but look
[1:38:10.720 --> 1:38:16.440]  the the establishment that covers up natural cancer cures and pushes toxic chemotherapy
[1:38:16.440 --> 1:38:20.960]  is killing their own people and this is a great example or a horrific example of that
[1:38:20.960 --> 1:38:28.440]  happening so we're going to monitor this situation but again this this intensifies the heat on
[1:38:28.440 --> 1:38:33.080]  the deep state and the globalists to remove trump if they lose another supreme court seat
[1:38:33.080 --> 1:38:37.200]  there's no chance ruth Bader Ginsburg can outlive the trump presidency so what will
[1:38:37.200 --> 1:38:41.440]  they do to maintain that seat i don't even want to think of the lengths uh that they
[1:38:41.440 --> 1:38:45.700]  might go to so a very situation a serious situation developing there uh now mike to
[1:38:45.700 --> 1:38:53.200]  segue if you don't mind the 5g rollout is right around the corner and i mean it's happening
[1:38:53.200 --> 1:38:59.640]  right now as atn t is rolling out a bunch of their 5g networks all across the united
[1:38:59.640 --> 1:39:06.640]  states including four cities in texas now this is kind of a weird stroke of coincidence
[1:39:06.640 --> 1:39:12.320]  if you believe that they're rolling out this 5g today it's the winter solstice there's
[1:39:12.320 --> 1:39:17.440]  a full moon tonight there's a meteor shower astrological rarities anomalies as they roll
[1:39:17.440 --> 1:39:20.960]  out this 5g i don't know if you think there's a connection there or not but speaking to
[1:39:20.960 --> 1:39:27.720]  the dangers of 5g mike again this is kind of almost like a chemotherapy to planet earth
[1:39:27.720 --> 1:39:34.400]  and and humans around the world that are going to be subjected to this well i i just posted
[1:39:34.400 --> 1:39:39.480]  a story about an hour ago that i promised to post a couple of days ago on the broadcast
[1:39:39.480 --> 1:39:43.800]  there and i encourage you to bring that up because it goes through the detailed attack
[1:39:43.800 --> 1:39:50.320]  on humanity there is a human extinction agenda underway uh it's inescapable once you look
[1:39:50.320 --> 1:39:54.840]  at the evidence here 5g is just part of that as you will know you reported on this in many
[1:39:54.840 --> 1:40:01.040]  different ways this is a weapon system that also doubles as a communication system it
[1:40:01.040 --> 1:40:07.560]  can be used in both ways it's a dual use technology and they can direct these beams these are
[1:40:07.560 --> 1:40:13.400]  5g beams at specific individuals and they can target you by your mobile device so if
[1:40:13.400 --> 1:40:19.040]  you're using a device that talks to the 5g towers you can be targeted and you can be
[1:40:19.040 --> 1:40:23.320]  given cancer specifically they can single you out of a crowd because it's the directional
[1:40:23.320 --> 1:40:31.640]  phase array antennas of this technology that make it a weapon system they can target individuals
[1:40:31.640 --> 1:40:37.520]  and as far as i can tell there is pretty much no resistance to this uh i mean you know maybe
[1:40:37.520 --> 1:40:42.000]  some pushback here on info wars and in the media but but as far as i'm concerned i see
[1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:46.880]  no pushback in government i see nobody warning about this i see it being promoted by brad
[1:40:46.880 --> 1:40:51.480]  parskill and steve's ghalise they're even celebrating it so mike this is you know this
[1:40:51.480 --> 1:40:57.040]  is coming and uh we're going to have to deal with this no matter what so what can people
[1:40:57.040 --> 1:41:03.840]  do to protect themselves well it it is incredible you think about the waves of assault on humanity
[1:41:03.840 --> 1:41:08.520]  it wasn't just the fluoride in the water it wasn't just the gmo's or the toxic vaccine
[1:41:08.520 --> 1:41:14.840]  ingredients that cause infertility and spontaneous abortions and seizures and so on it is layer
[1:41:14.840 --> 1:41:21.080]  upon layer of attack but there's money for the corporations in these attacks on humanity
[1:41:21.080 --> 1:41:26.160]  whether it's 5g or bio sludge or other things these are all attacks on humanity number one
[1:41:26.160 --> 1:41:31.280]  thing is for people to turn off the corporate controlled media turn on the independent media
[1:41:31.280 --> 1:41:37.560]  like info wars and spread the word because you know what awareness is the solution if
[1:41:37.560 --> 1:41:42.440]  people knew that they were under attack they would they would act out they they would speak
[1:41:42.440 --> 1:41:48.960]  up they would call their members of congress or or perhaps stage protest who knows what
[1:41:48.960 --> 1:41:53.400]  but humanity is being killed and most people are asleep and have no idea it's happening
[1:41:53.400 --> 1:41:58.880]  oh and that's where we are today awareness is the first step of the solution well that's
[1:41:58.880 --> 1:42:04.160]  absolutely accurate and and that's the same the same cause for globalism is to just shed
[1:42:04.160 --> 1:42:08.240]  a light on it and when people see what it is they're not interested in it so that's
[1:42:08.240 --> 1:42:12.440]  what we do here at info wars thank you so much mike again he is live on sundays with

[1:46:10.320 --> 1:46:15.920]  they can call bs if came over but if you look at everybody else like michael savage and russia
[1:46:15.920 --> 1:46:20.880]  lembaugh and tugger carlson and shon hannity they are all beholded to the networks they're on
[1:46:20.880 --> 1:46:27.440]  they can be targeted there's only two groups in the us info wars and matt rudge of rudge report
[1:46:27.440 --> 1:46:32.720]  dot com that are truly independent and of course there are two of the dominant media forces in the

[1:47:27.200 --> 1:47:31.760]  roger you're not allowed to say that you're supposed to keep that information secret
[1:47:31.760 --> 1:47:38.320]  so roger stone with us in studio here and uh there's there's more fake news attacks against
[1:47:38.320 --> 1:47:45.440]  roger stone but they're actually old news it's just rewriting articles in salon robert muhler
[1:47:45.440 --> 1:47:51.280]  is closing in on roger stone well they've been saying that for about two years now no it's flashback
[1:47:51.280 --> 1:47:59.920]  friday folks they wrote this exact same article one year ago then six months ago then six weeks ago
[1:47:59.920 --> 1:48:06.320]  uh this is how the fake news rolls salon is the worst of the worst a bunch of elitist
[1:48:06.320 --> 1:48:11.840]  faux hipsters none of them very good writers losing money like there is no tomorrow uh the only
[1:48:11.840 --> 1:48:17.200]  people reading this are aging hippies uh and millennials who don't know any better yet they
[1:48:17.200 --> 1:48:22.560]  keep recycling oh and the same fake news i do believe this is the same salon that said pedophilia
[1:48:22.560 --> 1:48:27.200]  was okay those are the you have them those are the people you're referring to wow really class
[1:48:27.200 --> 1:48:31.760]  people though uh there at salon and that was matthew rosa i think that wrote that article yes uh
[1:48:31.760 --> 1:48:35.840]  we're going to go ahead but if you've seen him you would know why he feels that way in all honesty
[1:48:35.840 --> 1:48:40.640]  this guy lives in his parents basement there's no doubt about it now it's it's cheap rent so we're
[1:48:40.640 --> 1:48:46.560]  going to go ahead and add matthew rosa to the uh coward and uh fraud watch and if he's not willing
[1:48:46.560 --> 1:48:50.800]  to come on and actually talk to you we'll go ahead and put him on the list as a as a total
[1:48:50.800 --> 1:48:56.000]  coward and fraud just like shelby holiday and then Natasha Bertrand she's a classic one same story
[1:48:56.000 --> 1:49:00.720]  they're bearing down on you no roger they're trying to destroy your life because you stood with
[1:49:00.720 --> 1:49:05.600]  america and you stood with trump yeah no this one i think bears some special attention Natasha
[1:49:05.600 --> 1:49:12.560]  Bertrand really rivals shelby holiday as the single worst reporter in america now i have a
[1:49:12.560 --> 1:49:17.680]  series of emails in which he actually reveals that she's been receiving classified information
[1:49:17.680 --> 1:49:22.880]  from eric swallows well uh which of course is a violation of law there will be a republican
[1:49:22.880 --> 1:49:28.400]  member of congress filing a formal complaint against swallows well for these activities
[1:49:28.400 --> 1:49:35.200]  but Natasha Bertrand is literally human garbage for example she writes yet again that roger stone
[1:49:35.200 --> 1:49:40.880]  says the new york talk show host randy critico was his source but she never references the more
[1:49:40.880 --> 1:49:46.800]  than 80 pages of text messages which i provided publicly proving beyond dispute that that is a
[1:49:46.800 --> 1:49:53.440]  fact an indisputable fact so Natasha we're watching you every day every night you are the epitome
[1:49:53.440 --> 1:50:00.240]  of fake news you're a piece of human garbage than Natasha Bertrand human garbage you gotta
[1:50:00.240 --> 1:50:04.000]  you gotta like that so we're gonna we'll reach out to her she's not going to be on the coward and
[1:50:04.000 --> 1:50:07.840]  fraud watch and uh she probably won't come on and address you because she's too big of a coward to
[1:50:07.840 --> 1:50:12.800]  do so but roger what they're trying to do is they're trying to take your testimony and and let
[1:50:12.800 --> 1:50:17.360]  Mueller redact and and manipulate it however he wants before it goes out public so that they can
[1:50:17.360 --> 1:50:21.680]  make up some more lies about you yeah no that's why yesterday as you know Owen i called on the
[1:50:21.680 --> 1:50:26.880]  house intelligence committee to release the transcript of my testimony publicly people
[1:50:26.880 --> 1:50:33.520]  have forgotten the fact that i wanted my testimony to be in public i wanted to be televised let the
[1:50:33.520 --> 1:50:40.000]  whole world see the democrats jumping up and down and asking like a holes let them see me answering
[1:50:40.000 --> 1:50:45.920]  every single question i was not there under subpoena i was there voluntarily the documents that i
[1:50:45.920 --> 1:50:51.120]  turned over were not turned over under subpoena they were turned over voluntarily after two hours
[1:50:51.120 --> 1:50:55.280]  of being badgered traig out he said well mr. stone you're not really here under a subpoena
[1:50:55.280 --> 1:50:59.680]  you're free to get up and leave any time and i said no congressman i want to stay until there
[1:50:59.680 --> 1:51:05.760]  are no more questions and i answered questions for two and a half more hours but by by having this
[1:51:05.760 --> 1:51:11.120]  entire process conducted in secret robert moeller can come back in a week and say well
[1:51:11.920 --> 1:51:18.000]  the the the document said redacted and redacted and therefore roger stone dot lied about his
[1:51:18.000 --> 1:51:24.160]  communications with jerry coursey let's have some full disclosure here let's have absolute
[1:51:24.160 --> 1:51:30.320]  transparency i call yet again for the house intelligence committee to release the full
[1:51:30.320 --> 1:51:36.080]  transcript today oh and it's unbelievable i'm not even allowed to have a copy my lawyers are
[1:51:36.080 --> 1:51:40.640]  allowed to examine the transcript in a secret little locked up room but they're not even allowed
[1:51:40.640 --> 1:51:47.200]  to take notes that's how secret this is it's an affront to everything we believe in release
[1:51:47.200 --> 1:51:54.000]  my testimony and it will prove definitively it's adam schiff who's a liar don't don't swell well
[1:51:54.000 --> 1:52:02.240]  that it's covered in schiff i mean this guy is is mounting a veritable schiff storm of disinformation
[1:52:02.240 --> 1:52:09.600]  about me uh he said recently that my contacts with wiki leaks are more extensive than previously
[1:52:09.600 --> 1:52:15.200]  disclosed congressman i'm calling you out prove it what contacts are referring to show us the
[1:52:15.200 --> 1:52:21.360]  transmissions oh they don't exist that's because you are full of schiff and it really tells you
[1:52:21.360 --> 1:52:27.360]  how much of a piece of human trash schiff is that he knows that this is all bullcrap he knows the
[1:52:27.360 --> 1:52:31.520]  whole thing is a lie he was the one that tried to collude with russia during a prank phone call
[1:52:31.520 --> 1:52:37.280]  that we have on record so he's just there wasting your time wasting congress's time wasting taxpayer
[1:52:37.280 --> 1:52:41.520]  dollars that is what adam schiff is best at welcome he's been making all these defamatory
[1:52:41.520 --> 1:52:48.160]  claims about me it's time for him to shift or get off the pot couldn't resist sorry are there any
[1:52:48.160 --> 1:52:53.040]  more because we got you know you know what i say if it's schiff flush it there it is all right and
[1:52:53.040 --> 1:52:58.720]  for those of you listening on radio we said schiff every time sch iff just to be clear all right
[1:52:58.720 --> 1:53:01.760]  we're going to open up the phone lines guys in fact if you could give me i don't know if we've got
[1:53:01.760 --> 1:53:06.720]  the caller list up or not yet okay so we're going to open up the phone lines here but roger this is
[1:53:07.760 --> 1:53:13.040]  this is really next level marketing or or or or salesmanship i don't know i don't know what you
[1:53:13.040 --> 1:53:19.360]  want to call this but the roger stone is going viral it is unbelievable oh and um the the this is
[1:53:19.360 --> 1:53:27.520]  the roger stone okay this is a paperweight in which i take a sit a a stone and i sign my name to it
[1:53:27.520 --> 1:53:34.000]  now this is an exact historical replica we did a lot of research of the very stone that little
[1:53:34.000 --> 1:53:39.120]  david used to bring down goliath yeah you got the archives we did and we sell it of course as a paper
[1:53:39.120 --> 1:53:43.680]  weight that's the purpose of it now the reason that i devised this was to raise money for my legal
[1:53:43.680 --> 1:53:49.600]  defense fund as i think most people know robert moeller and the house and senate democrats and
[1:53:49.600 --> 1:53:55.600]  all these left-wing groups including the dnc who have sued me are trying to drive me into bankruptcy
[1:53:56.160 --> 1:54:02.800]  so this christmas i need help from the info warrior army i need people to go to stonedefensefund.com
[1:54:02.800 --> 1:54:10.400]  but one way we are raising money is through the sale of these roger stones and um talking points
[1:54:10.400 --> 1:54:17.040]  memo and rolling stone and other faux hipster jerkoffs uh went out there and posted stories
[1:54:17.040 --> 1:54:22.720]  making fun of me for selling these the result of that is thousands of people have now gone to the
[1:54:22.720 --> 1:54:30.240]  website ordering their stone so if you want one go to stone cold truth dot com and then go click on
[1:54:30.240 --> 1:54:37.280]  shop and you will find the stone get your roger stone today oh and schwerer was presented one
[1:54:37.280 --> 1:54:42.800]  yesterday as his christmas present he couldn't be happier all right we have got some calls we're
[1:54:42.800 --> 1:54:47.440]  going to take but alex jones is on the phone right now with some breaking news uh let's go to alex
[1:54:47.440 --> 1:54:54.240]  jones now go ahead alex sure well let's be clear i'm up here and i'm on a breath taking my father
[1:54:54.240 --> 1:54:59.760]  in law with my wife the doctor he's having some medical issues so that's why i am not in the atx but
[1:54:59.760 --> 1:55:04.800]  i'm listening to you guys while i sit here at the hospital they're doing a great job but i i really
[1:55:04.800 --> 1:55:11.040]  want to get roger's expertise on how incredible it is that we've seen the shakeup of the chief of
[1:55:11.040 --> 1:55:17.280]  staff and now we've seen uh madis which we knew were brought in by bannon roger knew this first
[1:55:17.280 --> 1:55:21.840]  he told me over a year and a half ago bann's bad i said i don't care i'm gonna be a team player
[1:55:21.840 --> 1:55:26.000]  and he said okay you're crazy and then turned out bannon was the mole the whole time so roger
[1:55:26.000 --> 1:55:30.480]  got him out of that so so so when you guys come back the next hour here take some calls but i first
[1:55:30.480 --> 1:55:35.440]  want to hear you get into know what roger's take on this how big it is that he's pulling out of
[1:55:35.440 --> 1:55:40.960]  afghanistan and syria a campaign promise that means he's now not listening to them he's going
[1:55:40.960 --> 1:55:45.040]  what he originally said he would do and this is the maximum effort i think of the deep state will
[1:55:45.040 --> 1:55:49.920]  now try to come after him i also want to get into uh you know the move to take section 230 away from
[1:55:49.920 --> 1:55:54.720]  the deck which you know trump is behind with gulmer i mean trump is really taking the gloves off
[1:55:55.520 --> 1:56:01.920]  in so many ways this this is so historic i'm so excited and now to see trump deliver so good before
[1:56:01.920 --> 1:56:06.720]  but fail in a few areas because of the people he had around him to see him shaking these people off
[1:56:06.720 --> 1:56:12.320]  and having litigants uh saying he's going to go after moeller and all this i mean this i'm not a
[1:56:12.320 --> 1:56:17.120]  spectator we're in the middle of this our audience are spectators they're involved by supporting us
[1:56:17.120 --> 1:56:22.160]  to spread the word but this is so epic i'm on the edge of my feet i know i'm on a cell phone
[1:56:22.160 --> 1:56:25.760]  a hospital so i'm gonna go back to you guys but i want to hear all this before you take calls please
[1:56:25.760 --> 1:56:32.240]  take over well roger i mean just talk about briefly before we go to this break just the the
[1:56:32.240 --> 1:56:38.000]  epicness in that's going on in dc right now there's never been anything like it well um i didn't get
[1:56:38.000 --> 1:56:42.080]  most of that audio so i'm gonna have to riff through this but you know this reminds me very
[1:56:42.080 --> 1:56:49.280]  much of 1974 when there was a mainstream media democratic alliance a combine designed to take
[1:56:49.280 --> 1:56:55.600]  down president richard nixon nixon's real sin he negotiated a strategic arms limitation with the
[1:56:55.600 --> 1:57:00.960]  soviets he opened the door to china he ended the vietnam war oh my god the man was a peacemaker
[1:57:00.960 --> 1:57:05.920]  you see the same thing happening right now down from taking our troop level in afghanistan down
[1:57:05.920 --> 1:57:12.320]  by 50 bringing our boys home uh removing our troops from syria the deep state is going into hard
[1:57:12.320 --> 1:57:19.280]  drive high uh they've gone into uh high gear because war is extremely profitable and the lobbyists
[1:57:19.280 --> 1:57:24.480]  for the defense contractors they're part of the deep state too uh and the neocons who continue
[1:57:24.480 --> 1:57:30.240]  to infect donald trump's pentagon donald trump's national security apparatus donald trump's national
[1:57:30.240 --> 1:57:35.120]  intelligence operas they are besides themselves when they found out that when the president pledged
[1:57:35.120 --> 1:57:39.600]  to the american people in the last election that he was tired of endless foreign war where
[1:57:39.600 --> 1:57:45.600]  our inherent national interests were not clear he wasn't kidding donald trump peacemaker now
[1:57:45.600 --> 1:57:50.480]  they really want to take him out the globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world
[1:57:50.480 --> 1:57:55.600]  government that's above the law if there's any opposition if there's any independent media
[1:57:56.240 --> 1:58:02.800]  they can call the fact that the emperor has no close they can call bs it's game over but if you
[1:58:02.800 --> 1:58:07.520]  look at everybody else like michael savage and russia limbaugh and tucker carlson and sean hennedy
[1:58:07.520 --> 1:58:13.680]  they are all beholded to the networks they're on they can be targeted there's only two groups in the
[1:58:13.680 --> 1:58:19.920]  us info wars and matt rudge of drudge report dot com that are truly independent and of course
[1:58:19.920 --> 1:58:25.360]  they're two of the dominant media forces in the world it really is amazing that's why is we closed

[1:59:58.960 --> 2:00:08.960]  you
[2:00:20.800 --> 2:00:26.800]  so ruth bader ginsberg is not healthy and she's undergoing some very serious lung
[2:00:26.800 --> 2:00:32.720]  surgery her time here on this earth is is not going to be outlasting
[2:00:32.720 --> 2:00:36.880]  president trump's time in office is is where the odds are there this is not something we're
[2:00:36.880 --> 2:00:42.320]  celebrating this is just a matter of fact now roger we just saw the democrats go to
[2:00:42.320 --> 2:00:49.840]  extraordinary lengths tell extraordinary lies extraordinary tales to keep brett cavinal off
[2:00:49.840 --> 2:00:54.480]  the supreme court who has a lot of you know kind of establishment ties of bushite who just kept
[2:00:54.480 --> 2:00:59.600]  playing parent and getting funding at the state level so just if we just saw what they did to
[2:00:59.600 --> 2:01:04.800]  try to keep him off the supreme court can you even imagine what they would do if ruth bader
[2:01:04.800 --> 2:01:10.080]  ginsberg doesn't end up lasting outlasting the trump presidency can you imagine the the dirty
[2:01:10.080 --> 2:01:15.760]  tricks of the democrats look i think this is the democrats worst nightmare donald trump
[2:01:15.760 --> 2:01:22.640]  forging a permanent conservative majority on the u.s supreme court of younger jurists who can last
[2:01:22.640 --> 2:01:28.480]  decades this is what's driving them crazy so here's what i can predict regardless of who the
[2:01:28.480 --> 2:01:34.640]  president selects as his nominee man or woman they will accuse that person of doing something wrong
[2:01:34.640 --> 2:01:38.960]  it will be totally manufactured it will be fraudulent and they'll have no evidence
[2:01:38.960 --> 2:01:44.000]  they'll have no proof they'll have no corroboration it'll be wild like for example they might accuse
[2:01:44.000 --> 2:01:50.560]  the nominee of being a gang rapist for example or of drugging and raping members of the opposite
[2:01:50.560 --> 2:01:56.800]  sex something really crazy and unbelievable like that exactly like they did with judge brett
[2:01:56.800 --> 2:02:02.720]  kavanaugh and then they will try to whip the people into a faux hysteria based on these false
[2:02:02.720 --> 2:02:09.920]  charges now so this is info wars tomorrow's news today you heard it here first whoever the president
[2:02:09.920 --> 2:02:17.600]  nominates man or woman will be accused of some untoward illegal outrageous act and they will
[2:02:17.600 --> 2:02:22.880]  produce no evidence whatsoever but the democrats will go into high gear insisting that it really
[2:02:22.880 --> 2:02:27.920]  happened yeah my guess is they come up with some crazy accusation maybe it's like something from
[2:02:27.920 --> 2:02:32.080]  high school or something they were at some weird party or some nonsense it'll be just totally
[2:02:32.080 --> 2:02:37.040]  ridiculous and then two days later eyewitnesses will come forward the eyewitnesses to the event
[2:02:37.040 --> 2:02:41.840]  i mean i don't really know i can't think of who the president might want to put on the supreme
[2:02:41.840 --> 2:02:48.240]  court i don't want to name any names janine pierrow but uh i think there are a number of of
[2:02:48.240 --> 2:02:54.400]  woman attorneys who would be highly qualified both on the bench or in private practice today
[2:02:54.400 --> 2:03:00.880]  former prosecutors perhaps who'd be ideal for this position uh and therefore i i think it's
[2:03:00.880 --> 2:03:06.720]  safe to say that the president is going to go back to the list that was supplied to him by the
[2:03:06.720 --> 2:03:12.000]  federalist society a list that he pledged when he was running for president that he would choose
[2:03:12.000 --> 2:03:18.880]  from there's an eminent number of men and women on that list there's a few more libertarian oriented
[2:03:18.880 --> 2:03:23.680]  jurists i would urge him to look in that direction particularly given the fact that
[2:03:23.680 --> 2:03:28.560]  this president in the last couple days has withdrawn our troops from syria and taken our
[2:03:28.560 --> 2:03:34.160]  troop number down in in afghanistan he assigned sweeping legislation to change the criminal
[2:03:34.160 --> 2:03:39.760]  justice system so that people who are convicted of first time nonviolent crimes are not put in
[2:03:39.760 --> 2:03:48.000]  jail forever uh and he is legalized industrial hemp all key points on the libertarian agenda mr
[2:03:48.000 --> 2:03:56.480]  president you are a libertarian you just don't know it i would like to see it's amy barrett cohen i
[2:03:56.480 --> 2:04:01.280]  think was the uh yes she was kind of the runner up yeah she would be an excellent nominee now
[2:04:01.280 --> 2:04:07.760]  there's a giant problem right off the bat she's pro life so the she has to be destroyed the left
[2:04:07.760 --> 2:04:12.800]  will go insane she must be destroyed because she would probably vote to overturn roe v way
[2:04:13.600 --> 2:04:21.120]  that will drive them completely insane uh speaking of that the movie roe v wade will be coming out in
[2:04:21.120 --> 2:04:28.160]  january i have a small cameo in that movie my friend gary heaven has a small carrot cameo in that
[2:04:28.160 --> 2:04:36.320]  movie this is a blockbuster um it really is going to be uh extraordinary you got a tune in for that
[2:04:36.320 --> 2:04:41.040]  yeah the democrats don't like you getting in the way of their child's sacrifice uh that's for darn
[2:04:41.040 --> 2:04:45.600]  sure all right we're gonna come back on the other side more with roger stone your phone calls and
[2:04:45.600 --> 2:04:50.880]  what happens i mean let's say ruth bader ginsberg i mean tragically doesn't have even a month left i
[2:04:50.880 --> 2:04:58.800]  mean we're we're really in a tight spiral here the globalists are trying to set up a private
[2:04:58.800 --> 2:05:04.160]  corporate world government that's above the law if there's any opposition or there's any independent
[2:05:04.160 --> 2:05:10.400]  media they can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes they can call bs it's game over
[2:05:11.440 --> 2:05:15.920]  but if you look at everybody else like michael savage and russia lembaugh and tugger carlson
[2:05:15.920 --> 2:05:20.880]  and sean hennedy they are all beholded to the networks they're on that can be targeted there's
[2:05:20.880 --> 2:05:27.840]  only two groups in the us info wars and matt rudge of drudge report dot com that are truly independent
[2:05:28.480 --> 2:05:32.560]  and of course there are two of the dominant media forces in the world it really is amazing
[2:05:33.120 --> 2:05:38.080]  that's why as we close out 2018 i want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're
[2:05:38.080 --> 2:05:42.000]  all in and how far we've come together just remind you that you are the power you're the strength
[2:05:42.000 --> 2:05:48.800]  through the will of info wars so please spread the links info wars dot com news wars dot com
[2:05:48.800 --> 2:05:52.720]  christen punna dot com because if you don't spread the articles the videos no one else will
[2:05:53.280 --> 2:05:55.840]  we're all in each other's hands god bless you all and thank you
[2:05:55.840 --> 2:06:08.560]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[2:06:12.240 --> 2:06:17.280]  you know one really cool part about uh in the head of the info wars network is when i'm
[2:06:17.280 --> 2:06:23.520]  even on so-called vacation visiting my wife's family in Omaha i get to call into my own show
[2:06:23.520 --> 2:06:27.040]  and take it over and comment here but but this is not going to comment here we were going to air
[2:06:27.040 --> 2:06:32.000]  a couple special reports that people put up in the last two segments of this hour but let's just
[2:06:32.000 --> 2:06:36.640]  not do that so roger and no one have time to take all these calls for people that are holding
[2:06:37.680 --> 2:06:42.160]  we've got a guest host obviously in the fourth hour of this friday edition uh coming up today
[2:06:42.160 --> 2:06:47.440]  but i just wanted to bring this up as i'm listening here to roger and he brought up the
[2:06:47.440 --> 2:06:53.440]  judging pierrow she's super smart she's got a great record she's super good-looking but she's also
[2:06:53.440 --> 2:06:59.840]  tough and whether it's a man or a woman whether it's barrett or her they're going to make up outrageous
[2:06:59.840 --> 2:07:05.600]  crap criminal stuff you name it and so i think judge denise perfect because she's close to the
[2:07:05.600 --> 2:07:11.920]  president she's strong she's a very conservative voting record and she's tough and she will destroy
[2:07:11.920 --> 2:07:17.920]  it instead of just sitting there crying like avid on getting upset i don't know why you did i remember
[2:07:17.920 --> 2:07:22.880]  thinking god have judged you mean i know i'm for a fact your logic was pushing her if judge
[2:07:22.880 --> 2:07:28.480]  janine was in there she would absolutely chew them to hell because when you're being accused of
[2:07:28.480 --> 2:07:34.720]  something to have it done just attack getting their face instead of being shocked by it and
[2:07:35.760 --> 2:07:39.600]  i think that's the move with riz better ginsberg preparing to make the jump into hyperspace
[2:07:39.600 --> 2:07:44.560]  uh after already having chemotherapy and not in cancer again and going through lung surgery today
[2:07:44.560 --> 2:07:50.160]  we wish her well but my god years ago she was stumbling around like she was a reanimated corpse
[2:07:51.280 --> 2:07:56.720]  so this is a big deal and it shows why the left is so scared they're the traders that sold the
[2:07:56.720 --> 2:08:00.560]  country out but they're the people that thought they were invincible and all over the world
[2:08:00.560 --> 2:08:08.080]  humanity's awakening yes it's not fun we're the brunt of their attack but it doesn't matter because
[2:08:08.080 --> 2:08:14.720]  the fight is on so please roger inno and get into that and let's start rafting judge to be pure
[2:08:14.720 --> 2:08:19.200]  i totally agree with you we need to get these names out there i know she's already close to
[2:08:19.200 --> 2:08:23.840]  president and then let's go to the phone calls to balance the hour thank you gentlemen go ahead
[2:08:24.400 --> 2:08:29.360]  well and i think because because we've already been down this road recently roger with with
[2:08:29.360 --> 2:08:35.600]  judge brett cavanaugh trump can even go in with a little more strategy to this and let's say he wants
[2:08:35.600 --> 2:08:41.920]  to pull kind of a you know they call it a 4g chest move and you put judge janine out there as the
[2:08:41.920 --> 2:08:48.000]  nominee and you let them destroy her excoriate her she defends it but then he says okay fine
[2:08:48.000 --> 2:08:53.040]  we'll pull it back and then we'll put you know amy barrett going on so because we've kind of seen
[2:08:53.040 --> 2:08:59.120]  the tactics now of the total just unhinged democrats i think trump can can now learn how to use that
[2:08:59.120 --> 2:09:03.200]  to his advantage well i'm not sure people understand that janine piero served with great
[2:09:03.200 --> 2:09:08.560]  distinction as the westchester county district attorney she was a crusading district attorney
[2:09:08.560 --> 2:09:15.520]  and she was very aggressive on sex crimes child exploitation and so on she is just a great great
[2:09:15.520 --> 2:09:22.240]  woman tough as nails deeply principled extremely articulate and yes for many years close to the
[2:09:22.240 --> 2:09:28.640]  president she would be an ideal nominee in my opinion as you point out um generally speaking
[2:09:28.640 --> 2:09:33.680]  we try to put at this point people on the bench who are younger at all levels so that the trump
[2:09:33.680 --> 2:09:39.520]  revolution can outlast him and that would be the only reservation although in all honesty judge
[2:09:39.520 --> 2:09:47.760]  janine looks very young to me uh and i think she'd be a great nominee guaranteed to drive the left
[2:09:47.760 --> 2:09:54.080]  completely insane now i don't know what judge janine's future is at fox where i believe that
[2:09:54.080 --> 2:10:01.040]  some of the greatest talent there sean hannity my friend tucker carlson judge janine judge andrew
[2:10:01.040 --> 2:10:06.320]  napolitano whose recent comments kind of bewilder me but who i still think is fundamentally a good
[2:10:06.320 --> 2:10:11.680]  man um i don't know what their future is as the murdox try to move fox to become more like the
[2:10:11.680 --> 2:10:18.400]  sky channel and try to erase all the things that made fox profitable and uh one of the most trusted
[2:10:18.400 --> 2:10:26.240]  names in news today uh it is really sad to see what's happening at fox shemp smith watching this guy
[2:10:26.240 --> 2:10:32.000]  i like too much better when he was in the three stooges this guy is a clown giving him two hours
[2:10:32.000 --> 2:10:37.120]  in the middle of the day to spout left wing disinformation that's not television that's
[2:10:37.120 --> 2:10:44.000]  garbage and and just total stupidity too i mean just nothing to shamp shamp smith shamp shamp good
[2:10:44.000 --> 2:10:51.200]  old shampy shamp smith yeah he's a he's a little light in the loafers uh appears that way uh but uh
[2:10:51.200 --> 2:10:55.360]  folks the other thing i want to remind all of you of because it's important uh if you like
[2:10:55.360 --> 2:11:00.480]  what owen and i do here every day at the war room if you like the iconic alex joneshow if you're
[2:11:00.480 --> 2:11:07.760]  tuning in to uh david night recognize that we are literally under siege here you see they one of the
[2:11:07.760 --> 2:11:13.920]  reasons they want to close info wars down is because they know that i can use it as a platform to
[2:11:13.920 --> 2:11:20.720]  defend myself from the onslaught of robert moeller and congressman adam schiff and congressman
[2:11:20.720 --> 2:11:28.960]  eric swallows well and the whole cabal of uh of uh of left wing democrat congressman who smear
[2:11:28.960 --> 2:11:34.480]  and defame me i would like frankly to put me in jail they know i can come on info wars and tell you
[2:11:34.480 --> 2:11:41.520]  the truth they know that info wars is a platform that alex jones can use to mobilize millions of
[2:11:41.520 --> 2:11:47.040]  americans if there's an illicit attempt to take down our president the left is always love civil
[2:11:47.040 --> 2:11:51.920]  disobedience when it's on the left this is one of the greatest things about dr martin luther king
[2:11:51.920 --> 2:11:57.680]  and i guarantee you there will be civil disobedience if there is an illicit attempt to take down our
[2:11:57.680 --> 2:12:04.000]  president but it needs a paul revere it needs a beacon of truth it needs a platform where people

[2:20:49.600 --> 2:20:57.200]  crazy perhaps now a supreme court justice seat up we're really looking at uh quite wild things
[2:20:57.200 --> 2:21:04.560]  coming across here the pipeline in 2019 are we not we really are you know in all honesty a shout
[2:21:04.560 --> 2:21:10.960]  out is due to two outstanding public servants at least in this case senator mitch mcconnell
[2:21:10.960 --> 2:21:17.040]  and senator ran paul principally responsible for the inclusion of the legalization of industrial
[2:21:17.040 --> 2:21:22.000]  hemp in the farm bill that president trump signed last week this is something that libertarians and
[2:21:22.000 --> 2:21:28.000]  free thinkers have been fighting for for decades so uh in this particular case our hats off to
[2:21:28.000 --> 2:21:34.080]  mitch mcconnell and senator ran paul whose original idea this was to having the courage
[2:21:34.080 --> 2:21:39.280]  to push this through and of course to the president for signing it hemp hemp array
[2:21:40.000 --> 2:21:43.600]  all right let's open up the phone lines here we've already got callers lined up
[2:21:43.600 --> 2:21:47.840]  we're going to start with chris calling in from chicago wants to talk supreme court go ahead chris
[2:21:50.320 --> 2:21:56.400]  hey gentlemen how are you great thanks for calling uh well first of all i just want to tell
[2:21:56.400 --> 2:22:02.560]  you and the crew i put the blood of jesus christ over you every single day thank you um listen uh
[2:22:02.560 --> 2:22:06.560]  you know something's more annoying than the word bipartisanship because it never works in
[2:22:06.560 --> 2:22:11.600]  conservatives favor you know is there's always this sort of a linsky delay tactic with these
[2:22:11.600 --> 2:22:19.360]  ass clowns you know they're always saying trust meuler uh you know give us abortion with the
[2:22:19.360 --> 2:22:25.920]  mother's life and rape and incest the second amendment they want to ban bump stocks uh and
[2:22:25.920 --> 2:22:32.080]  registration and you know it kind of uh over Thanksgiving i had a you know sort of come to
[2:22:32.080 --> 2:22:37.280]  jesus moment with my family a lot of conservatives a lot of good people but they're not willing to go
[2:22:37.280 --> 2:22:45.680]  on office to take the clubs off and sort of get back at people's spaces when um you know it's not
[2:22:45.680 --> 2:22:51.520]  going in their favor they just sort of lay down and take it and and i just well let me let me let me
[2:22:51.520 --> 2:22:55.520]  see if i can let me see if i can articulate what i think you're trying to say uh a little bit
[2:22:55.520 --> 2:23:00.160]  differently basically it's like if you're a conservative and you're trying to negotiate
[2:23:00.160 --> 2:23:06.240]  you have a negotiation and you reach an agreement and that's just you trying to you know be negotiable
[2:23:06.240 --> 2:23:11.280]  and be open to so that you can you know have some some compromise but when it's the the left of the
[2:23:11.280 --> 2:23:16.560]  Democrats doing it it's in their eyes it's this okay i'm just chipping away that they're just
[2:23:16.560 --> 2:23:20.720]  chipping away getting further and further down their agenda they're not actually trying to compromise
[2:23:20.720 --> 2:23:26.640]  to them it's just furthering their agenda also conservatives um respect the rule of law uh and
[2:23:26.640 --> 2:23:31.680]  we're consistent we're not inconsistent they're hypocrites they have no respect for the rule of
[2:23:31.680 --> 2:23:40.320]  law so james clapper can lie under oath about the existence of a metadata collection agency
[2:23:40.320 --> 2:23:46.240]  uh and when we learn through their the uh disclosures of edward snowden that all of that is lie
[2:23:46.240 --> 2:23:51.280]  he's never prosecuted now they're going through my testimony trying to find out whether i said
[2:23:51.280 --> 2:23:55.520]  that the burger i had was medium rare when it was really well done it would actually be the other
[2:23:55.520 --> 2:24:02.960]  way around and say aha you see stone committed perjury the left has no uh they have no consistency
[2:24:02.960 --> 2:24:11.280]  they are absolute hypocrites general patrice can leak uh classified documents to his mistress
[2:24:11.280 --> 2:24:17.280]  he pays a hundred thousand dollars fine but general mike flinn is set up he doesn't even
[2:24:17.280 --> 2:24:23.360]  really lie to an fbi agent but they want to send him to prison you see there's no consistency on the
[2:24:23.360 --> 2:24:30.080]  left our people respect authority and they respect the law they respect nothing we don't want to take
[2:24:30.080 --> 2:24:35.840]  our guns and fix the situation we count on the police and the military who we pay to do that under
[2:24:35.840 --> 2:24:41.200]  the rule of law they have no such compunction the antifa thugs will go out and they will beat
[2:24:41.200 --> 2:24:46.800]  old people they will beat women they will assault private citizens they don't care about the law
[2:24:46.800 --> 2:24:51.760]  that's the difference between the left and the right so it's like a bipartisan agreement to ban
[2:24:51.760 --> 2:24:56.000]  bump stocks but but really it's just the left furthering their agenda to take guns is that
[2:24:56.000 --> 2:25:02.560]  what you're saying chris correct no no absolutely yeah i mean that's you know it never worked in
[2:25:02.560 --> 2:25:08.080]  conservative favor and we always end up giving up uh giving up you know ground well and that's why
[2:25:08.080 --> 2:25:12.480]  we need that's why the american people need to show their support for trump because he is the the
[2:25:12.480 --> 2:25:16.880]  stone wall that's that's that's not going to allow the left to just further their agenda at least
[2:25:16.880 --> 2:25:21.280]  that's why we elected him thank you so much for the call chris uh i've got to jump though
[2:25:21.280 --> 2:25:26.320]  let's go to let's stick with uh somebody who's well i won't even say what they want to talk about
[2:25:26.320 --> 2:25:29.600]  because most of the time they talk about something else so let's go to gerald in arkansas go ahead
[2:25:29.600 --> 2:25:36.640]  jared i'm i'm hearing you uh the uh ruth bader genberg will start with the supreme court first
[2:25:36.640 --> 2:25:42.880]  of all there's no supreme about it they're all bar attorneys i don't understand why people
[2:25:43.760 --> 2:25:49.120]  in the war you guys have got a lot of uh good whistleblowers on there but i know we talked
[2:25:49.120 --> 2:25:55.280]  about it before you had joe banister on there the people that know the constitution uh that the truth
[2:25:55.280 --> 2:26:01.280]  is not being brought forward you know we're still under common law they don't call it common legal
[2:26:01.280 --> 2:26:07.200]  it's common law but it's been covered up i see that that's what really gets to me uh anybody can
[2:26:07.200 --> 2:26:12.960]  go look it up but we're under uniform commercial code bar attorneys that they're not lawyers they're
[2:26:12.960 --> 2:26:17.680]  bar attorneys a law barrister is who wrote the constitution well look general you're getting
[2:26:17.680 --> 2:26:25.600]  into fundamental uh just total mental yeah just abandonments of what what america was intended
[2:26:25.600 --> 2:26:29.360]  to be i mean you can start at the supreme court you can end up with the constitution i mean
[2:26:29.360 --> 2:26:33.440]  you could really end anywhere but again you know this roger this kind of goes back to the left the
[2:26:33.440 --> 2:26:38.480]  last caller's point this has been what the left has done well instead of the instead of conservatives
[2:26:38.480 --> 2:26:43.200]  and liberals or whatever compromising it's just the left liberal agenda furthering itself well
[2:26:43.200 --> 2:26:47.520]  that's true right now there's a group of scientists and they're trying to figure out whether they can put
[2:26:47.520 --> 2:26:53.280]  ruth burr bader ginsberg's head in a glass case like future rama and as long as she still can
[2:26:53.280 --> 2:26:58.880]  talk they'll keep her on the supreme court kidding of course uh but hold on a second i i think that
[2:26:59.520 --> 2:27:05.120]  i think ruth bader ginsberg had may actually have been in a a future rama episode i think you're
[2:27:05.120 --> 2:27:11.520]  right actually because you see she's an icon for the left which shows you how screwed up they are
[2:27:11.520 --> 2:27:18.400]  are um matt drudge actually said they would put a head in a jar we might actually see ruth
[2:27:18.400 --> 2:27:23.040]  bader ginsberg head to the jar it's entirely possible well we've seen they put nixon's head
[2:27:23.040 --> 2:27:26.800]  in a jar i kind of enjoyed that if you want to know the truth i well i actually am a big fan of
[2:27:26.800 --> 2:27:33.520]  super rama but uh future rama but everybody knows like the weird predictions that the simpsons made
[2:27:33.520 --> 2:27:38.160]  and that matt groening um has somehow been able to do in his shows over the years guys see if you
[2:27:38.160 --> 2:27:42.880]  can find i i could have sworn i remember an episode with ruth bader ginsberg's head in a jar

[2:35:20.160 --> 2:35:25.840]  and midnight episode 369 his lady guest i can't remember her name but she's absolutely fantastic
[2:35:25.840 --> 2:35:31.440]  she has uncovered a treasure trove of information about the 9-11 cover-up that i would encourage
[2:35:31.440 --> 2:35:36.560]  i would literally encourage anyone to watch that it's stunning to say the least well and you know
[2:35:36.560 --> 2:35:40.480]  here's the thing about here's the thing about the 9-11 cover-up or conspiracy or whatever people
[2:35:40.480 --> 2:35:45.520]  want to call it there's just so many facts out there that that that never went reported on cable
[2:35:45.520 --> 2:35:49.360]  news so they never hear about it roger they never hear about uh mullers involvement they never hear
[2:35:49.360 --> 2:35:53.600]  about the terrorists coming in and out they never hear about the activity in florida uh with the
[2:35:53.600 --> 2:35:59.360]  corrupt bureaucrats the fact that john brennan as the station chief in ridda for the cia approves
[2:35:59.360 --> 2:36:06.080]  the visas for a number of the hijackers to leave their income year uh that never gets reported
[2:36:06.080 --> 2:36:12.960]  no the particularly the angle of saudi involvement uh is always fascinated me john b wells very good
[2:36:12.960 --> 2:36:18.000]  man does excellent work and i've seen that particular show that you refer to i really

[2:36:27.040 --> 2:36:31.520]  that they uh they may get banned for it all right let's go to jennifer calling in from illinois go
[2:36:31.520 --> 2:36:38.960]  ahead jennifer hi thanks i just wanted to point out that i think alex has mentioned before uh how
[2:36:38.960 --> 2:36:44.480]  the microchipping that we see coming down the pipeline really is seen in the book of revelation
[2:36:46.560 --> 2:36:54.400]  um additionally hello yes go ahead oh okay additionally i think there's one that's not
[2:36:54.400 --> 2:37:01.680]  widely recognized but that a lot of people understand uh revelation chapter 12 a great
[2:37:01.680 --> 2:37:08.480]  and mysterious sign appeared in the sky a woman who has closed in the sun so that was the miracle
[2:37:08.480 --> 2:37:19.600]  of the sun in phatoma in 1917 witnessed by over 70 000 people now honestly how many miracles in the
[2:37:19.600 --> 2:37:28.720]  bible were pre-predicted and witnessed by over 70 000 people like this is a big deal and it's
[2:37:28.720 --> 2:37:37.040]  absolutely been buried by the fake catholic church we have in power completely infiltrated you know
[2:37:38.240 --> 2:37:44.000]  people running the church are not catholic there are prophecies in it there are demands from god
[2:37:44.000 --> 2:37:51.360]  that have not been met and they've been nothing they've done nothing but really they've covered it up
[2:37:51.360 --> 2:37:56.800]  well there's no doubt there's no doubt the power of the bible and it's it's it's prophecy just the
[2:37:56.800 --> 2:38:01.120]  more i live and experience the more i realize that and there is also no doubt that's why they
[2:38:01.120 --> 2:38:04.960]  want it banned on social media that's why they attack christians and conservatives but yes the
[2:38:04.960 --> 2:38:11.600]  catholic church has been uh unfortunately corrupted for a long long time and the real uh big secrets
[2:38:11.600 --> 2:38:16.800]  to the vatican are all about how they can go in to these these sites where there's ancient burial
[2:38:16.800 --> 2:38:20.480]  grounds claim the land for religious purposes excavate the site send it to the vatican and
[2:38:20.480 --> 2:38:25.760]  then nobody ever sees it again and then of course you see all the sex abuse rampant going on you
[2:38:25.760 --> 2:38:30.640]  know it's very sad it's very sad because there was a time when the catholic church was uh was
[2:38:30.640 --> 2:38:36.720]  a bastion of anti-communism uh and when it really stood for biblical values and all honesty i think
[2:38:36.720 --> 2:38:43.680]  our current pope is a communist uh and he's betraying the values of the catholic church
[2:38:45.360 --> 2:38:51.440]  i really subscribe to what you say because given the extraordinary crucible that i'm going through
[2:38:51.440 --> 2:38:56.320]  it's only the bible and my belief in god that sustained me in this incredible flight
[2:38:56.320 --> 2:39:01.840]  robert moeller the deep state adam schiff and those clowns they want to send me to prison even
[2:39:01.840 --> 2:39:07.600]  though i have committed no crime whatsoever well that's not true my crime in their eyes is my support
[2:39:07.600 --> 2:39:14.560]  for donald trump and my opposition to hillary clinton and uh barack obama and the globalists
[2:39:14.560 --> 2:39:19.840]  and they literally want to send me to prison even though i've broken no laws they're trying to destroy
[2:39:19.840 --> 2:39:26.640]  me financially it is only through my faith in god and the loyal support of the info wars community
[2:39:26.640 --> 2:39:32.480]  that i am able to continue the fight and some days i must tell you it's daunting it's difficult
[2:39:32.480 --> 2:39:36.800]  and that's why i get down on my knees and pray so thank you for your call and you know just something
[2:39:36.800 --> 2:39:44.400]  else too thank you for the call jennifer it's like it's just like just the the power and the
[2:39:44.400 --> 2:39:51.120]  omnipotence of god it's like it's like roger if you knew that someone 500 years from now or a
[2:39:51.120 --> 2:39:55.680]  thousand years from now let's say you bury your roger stone somewhere and you know that someone
[2:39:55.680 --> 2:39:59.280]  500 years now is just going to come to that spot and for some reason they need that roger stone
[2:40:00.240 --> 2:40:04.400]  it's like you knew that like god knows that he's put all of these little easter eggs all these
[2:40:04.400 --> 2:40:10.080]  little things out there for us to have at that exact moment but when you don't understand that you
[2:40:10.080 --> 2:40:14.800]  were created in a divine nature you you never see god's language you never see how god is speaking
[2:40:14.800 --> 2:40:19.600]  to you and you miss the omnipotence and roger as you said i mean you've been calling on god to
[2:40:19.600 --> 2:40:24.320]  protect you while these demons here are trying to destroy your life and your family uh let's take
[2:40:24.320 --> 2:40:29.760]  another call here virginia calling in from kansas go ahead virginia hello thank you for taking my

[2:40:59.360 --> 2:41:06.720]  built by the army president trump has an absolute right to use the army to build the wall and i i
[2:41:06.720 --> 2:41:12.240]  just i i just have not heard that on the news anywhere because the these people in congress
[2:41:12.240 --> 2:41:17.200]  are telling us he doesn't so we need to know the people and well he's already used the military
[2:41:17.200 --> 2:41:21.280]  to secure the border fence and we've seen the videos with the barred wire going up a lot of
[2:41:21.280 --> 2:41:24.640]  people are thinking that you know maybe bringing the troops home you stationed them down at the
[2:41:24.640 --> 2:41:29.600]  border that might be something trump is thinking but roger how about this for a by the way thank
[2:41:29.600 --> 2:41:34.400]  you for the call virginia how about this for a weird kind of next i really think this is kind of
[2:41:34.400 --> 2:41:41.040]  the future of a free market republic is the crowdfunding crowdfunding project so like okay
[2:41:41.040 --> 2:41:45.600]  do we want a wall okay well let's go crowdfund it i think there's over 10 million dollars now
[2:41:45.600 --> 2:41:50.640]  on a go fund me for the wall right so how soon will it be before go before go find me closes that
[2:41:50.640 --> 2:41:54.240]  down as they close well they're making millions of dollars off this yeah but look what they did
[2:41:54.240 --> 2:41:58.640]  to laura loomer i mean laura loomer set up a go fund me account she they're trying to destroy her
[2:41:58.640 --> 2:42:04.160]  financially the same way they're trying to destroy me financially she put up a go fund me site to fund
[2:42:04.160 --> 2:42:11.600]  her incredibly effective investigative journalism and her questioning of radical islam and go fund
[2:42:11.600 --> 2:42:18.880]  me essentially deplatformed her so unfortunately even they are subject to the left-wing pressure
[2:42:18.880 --> 2:42:24.400]  from the skulls who just want to shut them down i commend this veteran from florida last
[2:42:24.400 --> 2:42:30.560]  last one i don't know where he is now this morning when i woke up he was at 11.7 it's over 12 now and
[2:42:30.560 --> 2:42:36.160]  and and incredible and this is in like 72 hours or so all right roger stone is going to stick with
[2:42:36.160 --> 2:42:39.760]  you and take some more phone calls in the next segment by the way environmentalists just stormed
[2:42:39.760 --> 2:42:45.280]  the bbc headquarters they want global warming a top editorial issue but they ignore the admitted
[2:42:45.280 --> 2:42:50.080]  climate change that that that governments do and they ignore the 5g coming and they ignore all the
[2:42:50.080 --> 2:42:56.240]  natural disasters of the gmo's and everything in the blood stage that they ignore that the globalists
[2:42:56.240 --> 2:43:01.360]  are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the law if there's any
[2:43:01.360 --> 2:43:07.280]  opposition if there's any independent media they can call the fact that the emperor has no close
[2:43:07.280 --> 2:43:13.760]  they can call bs it's game over but if you look at everybody else like michael savage and rush limbaugh
[2:43:13.760 --> 2:43:17.840]  and tucker carlson and sean hennedy they are all beholded to the networks they're on
[2:43:17.840 --> 2:43:24.400]  they can be targeted there's only two groups in the us info wars and matt rudge of drudge report
[2:43:24.400 --> 2:43:29.680]  dot com that are truly independent and of course they're two of the dominant media forces in the

[2:47:55.120 --> 2:48:03.680]  me i was literally gulping down advil but nothing was helping and then i got a few tabs of bodies
[2:48:03.680 --> 2:48:09.840]  here in the office from my friend harrison smith and i must tell you within one hour the pain was
[2:48:09.840 --> 2:48:16.800]  miraculously gone turmeric which is the key ingredients in bodies has been used for centuries
[2:48:17.440 --> 2:48:24.560]  as a pain reliever for sore joints and muscles and i must say it was extraordinarily effective

[2:48:42.400 --> 2:48:48.080]  wanted to take a nap i pop a couple of these and i'm ready for the war room which at my time is five
[2:48:48.080 --> 2:48:53.840]  o'clock eastern so tune into the war room today by the way when jacob engels from the central
[2:48:53.840 --> 2:49:00.080]  florida post joins me for a special update on steve bannon and why steve bannon has been
[2:49:00.080 --> 2:49:07.440]  secretly meeting with jeffrey epstein the convicted clinton pedophile pimp why would steve bannon
[2:49:07.440 --> 2:49:15.440]  allegedly a nationalist be secretly meeting with a a sex crime criminal affiliated with the clinton's
[2:49:15.440 --> 2:49:22.240]  tune in to the war room today to get an update on that let's go to our phone lines now uh and
[2:49:22.240 --> 2:49:29.040]  we'll take um charles in atlanta charles what's on your mind hey roger merry christmas you guys are
[2:49:29.040 --> 2:49:33.920]  doing an awesome job out there uh i just wanted to remind you guys of something you were talking
[2:49:33.920 --> 2:49:39.760]  about uh judge janine earlier uh with regard to being in the trump administration yes and i
[2:49:39.760 --> 2:49:43.520]  wanted to point out and there's a video of this you can look it up yourself it's called johar
[2:49:43.520 --> 2:49:49.840]  pile on immigration debate and his run for senate from early uh in january of this year uh sheriff
[2:49:49.840 --> 2:49:55.920]  joe brought up his investigations to judge janine uh and you know what the investigation was obama's
[2:49:55.920 --> 2:50:01.040]  forged documents and everything and she cut him off told him he basically didn't know what he was
[2:50:01.040 --> 2:50:06.720]  talking about called malaya right to his face this guy's a 50 year plus law enforcement officer
[2:50:06.720 --> 2:50:10.720]  who did a forensic investigation on all that stuff and he's absolutely telling the truth
[2:50:10.720 --> 2:50:16.160]  but she won't allow that just like everybody else on fox well i think i'm i think i'm in a unique
[2:50:16.160 --> 2:50:21.200]  position to address this because sheriff joe is a good friend of mine janine piero is a good friend
[2:50:21.200 --> 2:50:27.040]  of mine i'm going to chalk this up to her corporate masters at fox there's two things you cannot discuss
[2:50:27.040 --> 2:50:32.960]  at fox one of them is the issue just raised the other one is of course seth rich you can have no
[2:50:32.960 --> 2:50:38.960]  discussion of seth rich i think this is odd because a terrific article that i read in the nation
[2:50:38.960 --> 2:50:45.840]  magazine not exactly a right wing or conservative publication uh shows that some of the counter
[2:50:45.840 --> 2:50:51.600]  intelligence experts like bill binney and ray mcgovern and others point to very substantial
[2:50:51.600 --> 2:50:57.120]  forensic evidence that demonstrates that the democratic national committee was never hacked
[2:50:57.120 --> 2:51:04.720]  by anyone and it was much more likely based on the load times of downloads uh that the information
[2:51:04.720 --> 2:51:10.560]  that was allegedly perloined from the dnc was loaded to some kind of portable disk and taken
[2:51:10.560 --> 2:51:17.280]  out the back door most likely by you guessed it seth rich but the fox corporate masters will not
[2:51:17.280 --> 2:51:23.600]  allow sean hennedy or tucker carlson or judge napolitano or judge janine to discuss this
[2:51:23.600 --> 2:51:30.880]  so i'm going to chalk the fact to that she cut sheriff joe off up to her efforts uh to
[2:51:30.880 --> 2:51:36.560]  kowtow unfortunately to the people who pay her paycheck charles thank you very much for your
[2:51:36.560 --> 2:51:45.920]  call uh let's go to uh chris in washington state chris you with us
[2:51:49.760 --> 2:51:56.800]  all right we're gonna move on uh let's try um let's see let's go to kevin in west virginia
[2:51:56.800 --> 2:52:02.960]  kevin welcome to the alex joneshow hey mr stern um i wanted to talk to you about trump's tweets
[2:52:02.960 --> 2:52:08.640]  from uh yesterday talking about how if they try to criminally uh remove him the american people
[2:52:09.440 --> 2:52:18.080]  would have a revolt i think we're just too divided still to come together i mean the only thing that
[2:52:18.080 --> 2:52:25.840]  most americans can do nowadays is only to agree to disagree i mean i know these demon rats are are
[2:52:25.840 --> 2:52:33.600]  are insane enough to try to do something like that but if they succeed what do we do well first
[2:52:33.600 --> 2:52:38.640]  of all we we're not agreeing to disagree you see they don't want to debate that implies a debate
[2:52:38.640 --> 2:52:44.960]  and some civility their answer it when we want to discuss any issue when we want to get into the
[2:52:44.960 --> 2:52:51.760]  facts of the situation is to censor us they can't beat alex jones in a debate they know that they
[2:52:51.760 --> 2:52:58.240]  can't beat tucker carlson in a debate they know that they can't beat shawnhannity in a debate
[2:52:58.240 --> 2:53:03.360]  they know that they most certainly can't beat roger stone in a debate they really know that
[2:53:03.360 --> 2:53:09.680]  so their answer is to censor us take them off of youtube take them off of facebook take them off
[2:53:09.680 --> 2:53:15.680]  of twitter silence them that's how you know they are defeated because they cannot win a battle of
[2:53:15.680 --> 2:53:23.200]  ideas they cannot win a civil discussion and a civil debate now as i reported yesterday on info
[2:53:23.200 --> 2:53:29.920]  wars the president has told at least two people i know that he believes that if there is an illegitimate
[2:53:29.920 --> 2:53:36.320]  coup an attempt to take him down based on some fabricated case that the american people will
[2:53:36.320 --> 2:53:43.200]  rise up the american people are armed they still have a second amendment and there will be a counter
[2:53:43.200 --> 2:53:49.680]  revolution in this country he is not advocating civil war he is not for civil war but i think
[2:53:49.680 --> 2:53:55.120]  he understands that patriots were not going to put up with this as they did in 1974 and there's
[2:53:55.120 --> 2:54:02.320]  a reason in 1974 when richard nixon was taken down largely because he was a peacemaker he reached a
[2:54:02.320 --> 2:54:08.480]  strategic arms limitation with the soviets an agreement he opened the door to china he ended
[2:54:08.480 --> 2:54:15.520]  the vietnam war he saved israel unilaterally in the 1973 yam kipper war my god the man was a
[2:54:15.520 --> 2:54:21.040]  peacemaker we have to get rid of him but there was only one monolithic media in that day cbs
[2:54:21.040 --> 2:54:26.480]  abc and nbc the washington post the new york times the la times really the only national
[2:54:26.480 --> 2:54:33.440]  newspapers and therefore there was only one narrative now thanks to info wars dot com
[2:54:33.440 --> 2:54:40.720]  in the daily caller and bright bar in town hall and gateway pundit and big league politics and so
[2:54:40.720 --> 2:54:47.920]  many other great conservative and libertarian and pro trump oriented sites you have a balance
[2:54:47.920 --> 2:54:53.440]  in our news coverage and that's why they are moving to censorship that's why they want to shut
[2:54:53.440 --> 2:54:59.760]  info wars dot com down that's why we saw the head of google sundar pie come to washington
[2:54:59.760 --> 2:55:07.840]  yesterday and lie his ass off china i can't even find china in a map on a map oh my god uh
[2:55:07.840 --> 2:55:12.960]  we're not tracking anybody no no you can turn that tracking uh function off he doesn't mention
[2:55:12.960 --> 2:55:19.680]  that it continues to track you you just can't use the functions oh jerry nadler says the congressman
[2:55:19.680 --> 2:55:26.800]  from manhattan whose entire testimony was written by google lobbyists who every question he asked
[2:55:26.800 --> 2:55:32.720]  was written by the google lobbyists who's taken more cold cash from the parent company of google
[2:55:32.720 --> 2:55:39.360]  than any other member of congress this clown is compromised he's purchased he's bought he's
[2:55:39.360 --> 2:55:46.880]  corrupted but he says it's a right wing conspiracy theory that conservatives are disadvantaged
[2:55:46.880 --> 2:55:55.040]  in the search function of uh of google no jerry you're lying look at the project veritas videos
[2:55:55.040 --> 2:56:02.160]  look at the internal videos and memos that have been secured from inside google they are busted
[2:56:02.160 --> 2:56:10.400]  they are running a formulaic uh program to kneecap conservatives and liberals and republicans
[2:56:10.400 --> 2:56:17.680]  and trump supporters on social media and on the internet uh this is roger stone i've been sitting

[2:57:26.560 --> 2:57:49.760]  the globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the law
[2:57:50.720 --> 2:57:55.680]  if there's any opposition if there's any independent media that can call the fact

[3:00:13.360 --> 3:00:20.560]  and welcome back to info wars dot com this is dr nick baggage and i'm standing in on this
[3:00:21.360 --> 3:00:28.320]  hour before the christmas weekend and that's a fourth hour on the 21st of december 2018
[3:00:28.880 --> 3:00:34.560]  and you know in the news today is uh syria of course and i know we've been covering this
[3:00:34.560 --> 3:00:39.040]  in other segments with the other hosts today but i want to get into this just a little bit
[3:00:39.040 --> 3:00:44.560]  um and kind of a practical sort of way in thinking about syria and what took us there
[3:00:45.520 --> 3:00:51.840]  initially and i'm going to roll back in time a bit um back to uh even pre 9 11 and i want to
[3:00:51.840 --> 3:00:58.400]  start with where things were in afghanistan in the late 1970s early 1980s and for those that
[3:00:58.400 --> 3:01:04.560]  that don't remember this is when russia entered afghanistan entered a war with afghanistanis
[3:01:04.560 --> 3:01:10.800]  and why did they do that well there's a couple of really really really important reasons one is
[3:01:11.440 --> 3:01:17.360]  oil in the southern parts of russia and in the old republics that oil and gas needs to
[3:01:17.360 --> 3:01:23.280]  be carried into the western markets and into the asian markets and the question is how do you get
[3:01:23.280 --> 3:01:29.520]  it there and there's really only a couple of routes one is if you look at those that have
[3:01:29.520 --> 3:01:35.120]  the screen you can see sort of the lay of the land and if you look up towards turkey in the black
[3:01:35.120 --> 3:01:43.360]  sea region and you can see coming out of uh uzbekistan uh kazakhstan and southern russia you
[3:01:43.360 --> 3:01:48.800]  need to go through the black sea and then through the bosporus into the Mediterranean and then
[3:01:48.800 --> 3:01:54.080]  eventually into the atlantic in order to hit the major ports now when you look at how that's
[3:01:54.080 --> 3:02:00.880]  configured the choke points are the bosporus which is an extremely narrow space large tankers
[3:02:01.840 --> 3:02:07.440]  do have a little bit of difficulty in terms of navigating that also the black sea has become
[3:02:07.440 --> 3:02:13.920]  one of the most polluted seas in the world they used to have 126 species of fish that were harvestable
[3:02:13.920 --> 3:02:21.040]  in commercial ways there are only six harvestable in the black sea today and many don't realize it
[3:02:21.040 --> 3:02:27.840]  but going in then to the early 1990s it was a degradation of the black sea region that began
[3:02:27.840 --> 3:02:35.680]  sort of the southern russian and ukrainian um moves uh in terms of really turning against the old
[3:02:35.680 --> 3:02:41.760]  former soviet union those were the beginnings of organizations um within russia were primarily
[3:02:41.760 --> 3:02:47.040]  environmentally based because they had lost their livelihoods i mean in the black sea this was the
[3:02:47.040 --> 3:02:52.960]  Caribbean of that region if you will this is where russians went uh to recreate the beaches were
[3:02:52.960 --> 3:02:59.760]  soiled uh the fish where people made their livings were gone um and if you look on on the maps you
[3:02:59.760 --> 3:03:05.120]  can see clearly that to bring that oil across the black sea um created too big of a choke point
[3:03:05.120 --> 3:03:11.120]  putting pipelines in a nato country turkey uh did not serve a russian interest so they looked
[3:03:11.120 --> 3:03:18.080]  the other direction for access across afghanistan and eventually um pakistan and into uh into the
[3:03:18.080 --> 3:03:24.320]  seas when you when you think about natural resources the other big issue for afghanistan that most
[3:03:25.040 --> 3:03:31.440]  of the world is aware of and our military geologists have recently and in the last month
[3:03:31.440 --> 3:03:38.240]  issued press reports showing that there's over a trillion with a t a trillion dollars in natural
[3:03:38.240 --> 3:03:43.920]  resources on the surface that they've located within the boundaries of afghanistan certainly
[3:03:43.920 --> 3:03:49.600]  enough to build their own economy to build their own government and to build their own um place in
[3:03:49.600 --> 3:03:56.880]  the world and we've been there now longer than we were in world war two and world war one combined
[3:03:56.880 --> 3:04:01.920]  and we really start to need to start to ask ourselves what are our national interests as it
[3:04:01.920 --> 3:04:06.800]  relates to afghanistan and why did we go in and going back again to that time the russians were
[3:04:06.800 --> 3:04:11.200]  there we didn't like the russians being there so we got in their way how did we get in their way
[3:04:11.200 --> 3:04:18.160]  we formed an alliance allies what we hear about today and our allies then were the taliban
[3:04:18.160 --> 3:04:25.680]  osama bin lan we funded and trained to take on the soviets um and that's why um we're now in this
[3:04:25.680 --> 3:04:32.640]  dilemma that started with not adequately knowing who our allies were when they made them allies
[3:04:32.640 --> 3:04:36.480]  and they soon became our adversaries we're headed into the break we got a few more seconds to the
[3:04:36.480 --> 3:04:41.840]  segment when we get back let's talk some more about what shaped the middle east and goddess in
[3:04:41.840 --> 3:04:46.960]  the situation we're in today this is uh dr. nick baggett standing in in this fourth hour for info wars
[3:04:54.160 --> 3:04:58.720]  the globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the law
[3:04:59.680 --> 3:05:04.640]  if there's any opposition if there's any independent media that can call the fact
[3:05:04.640 --> 3:05:10.560]  that the emperor has no clothes they can call bs it's game over but if you look at everybody else
[3:05:10.560 --> 3:05:15.440]  like michael savage and russia limbaugh and tucker carlson and shahannity they are all beholded to
[3:05:15.440 --> 3:05:22.320]  the networks they're on that can be targeted there's only two groups in the us info wars and
[3:05:22.320 --> 3:05:27.360]  matt rudge of drudge report dot com that are truly independent and of course they're two of the
[3:05:27.360 --> 3:05:34.000]  dominant media forces in the world it really is amazing that's why as we close out 2018 i want to
[3:05:34.000 --> 3:05:37.760]  just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together
[3:05:37.760 --> 3:05:43.760]  just remind you that you are the power you're the strength you're the will of info wars so please
[3:05:43.760 --> 3:05:48.480]  spread the links info wars dot com news wars dot com prism planet dot com because if you don't
[3:05:48.480 --> 3:06:04.720]  spread the articles the videos no one else will we're all in each other's hands god bless you all and thank you
[3:06:04.720 --> 3:06:12.320]  the alex jones show because there is a war on for your mind with nick baggage
[3:06:12.320 --> 3:06:20.080]  and welcome back this is dr nick baggage and i'm we were just leaving off in that last segment
[3:06:20.080 --> 3:06:25.360]  talking a little bit sort of the backdrop what was happening in afghanistan in the late 1970s
[3:06:25.360 --> 3:06:31.600]  early 1980s and sort of what began to shape as sort of american policy interventions policy in
[3:06:31.600 --> 3:06:37.200]  this region really was to put a you know a wrench in the bicycles bicycle spokes of the sobiets to
[3:06:37.200 --> 3:06:44.000]  say we're riding down the hill in afghanistan so we formed an alliance an alliance with the taliban
[3:06:44.000 --> 3:06:50.160]  and and we began to train them through the central intelligence agency outfit them with weapons systems
[3:06:50.160 --> 3:06:57.120]  so they could take on the soviets at that time of course things changed you know and and this is
[3:06:57.120 --> 3:07:03.280]  again you know in today's news and yesterday's news we were hearing all about our allies you know
[3:07:03.280 --> 3:07:08.640]  sometimes we pick the wrong players you know and the taliban is a good case in point but let's
[3:07:08.640 --> 3:07:14.400]  let's jump from afghanistan for a moment and jump forward to 9 11 and 9 11 of course was
[3:07:15.360 --> 3:07:19.840]  blamed on the taliban and i know there's lots of controversy about that i'm not going to get into
[3:07:19.840 --> 3:07:25.040]  that today because really i'm talking about what triggered us as americans to get involved in the
[3:07:25.040 --> 3:07:29.920]  middle east and what was the rationale of our government at the time and it was we needed to
[3:07:29.920 --> 3:07:38.320]  take out these people that had done this this horror in new york city and so we sent in our
[3:07:38.320 --> 3:07:46.400]  military and and we just literally bombed them 100 years back in time and then we stayed and and
[3:07:46.400 --> 3:07:51.920]  as those remember the press reports at the time there was a lot of money flowing you know we
[3:07:51.920 --> 3:07:57.760]  were taking over plain loads of hundred dollar bills on pallets to pass out to bribe people to
[3:07:57.760 --> 3:08:02.960]  convince them that we were their allies to pay people off essentially and you know the problem
[3:08:02.960 --> 3:08:07.760]  with that was identified pretty pretty clearly shortly thereafter when we discovered that the
[3:08:07.760 --> 3:08:14.720]  president that we sort of installed in afghanistan more or less was also taking bribes from the russians
[3:08:14.720 --> 3:08:22.400]  then at that time so here we were we're spending billions and and in one case 12 billion in cash
[3:08:22.400 --> 3:08:28.560]  disappeared just vanished you know two and a half times what it cost to build a wall is
[3:08:28.560 --> 3:08:36.960]  the money unaccounted for in afghanistan alone 12 billion with a b billion dollars in unaccountable
[3:08:36.960 --> 3:08:41.600]  money now a lot of that money was spent through contractors if many will recall and that was
[3:08:41.600 --> 3:08:47.440]  blackwater and uh halliburton and you know when halliburton was going to get audited and they
[3:08:47.440 --> 3:08:51.840]  were going to start to look into where they were all this money went they pulled their corporate
[3:08:51.840 --> 3:08:57.040]  offices out of texas and moved them to dubai in the middle east where there are no extradition
[3:08:57.040 --> 3:09:02.560]  treaties and there's no reach of the u.s courts to subpoena those records to find out where our
[3:09:02.560 --> 3:09:10.000]  money went and these are the companies that are claiming cover in the middle east a little bit
[3:09:10.000 --> 3:09:14.080]  odd but these are also the companies that are also lobbying your congress to keep spending
[3:09:14.080 --> 3:09:19.280]  billions and billions and trillions that they get and they don't even they're not even accountable
[3:09:19.280 --> 3:09:24.880]  they don't even have to show where the money went it just disappears into the void of the middle east
[3:09:24.880 --> 3:09:31.280]  now let's take a look at syria which has been in the news in the last couple of days uh donald
[3:09:31.280 --> 3:09:36.880]  trump fulfilling one of his campaign promises to get us out of this thing um math this has just
[3:09:36.880 --> 3:09:42.000]  resigned because he disagrees now i got to ask americans that are listening to this broadcast
[3:09:42.000 --> 3:09:50.160]  can you think of one single reason of why we should be in syria right now because i can't
[3:09:51.200 --> 3:09:57.680]  and i read a lot i mean i study a lot and uh i just can't think of it now there's a group
[3:09:57.680 --> 3:10:01.840]  in this area of the middle east that we've been very supportive of and it's occurred and now i
[3:10:01.840 --> 3:10:07.680]  want to talk a little bit about that historically they had huge conflicts with the turk the turk
[3:10:07.680 --> 3:10:15.280]  turkish uh people in fact over a hundred years ago there was um an annihilation of curds that
[3:10:15.280 --> 3:10:20.480]  everybody's arguing with over that part of the world the fact is a million curds disappeared
[3:10:20.480 --> 3:10:26.000]  up face of the earth um everybody assumes they died i would i would go with that but this group
[3:10:26.640 --> 3:10:33.040]  is the only group in the last decade since we've been in this conflict in iraq and in syria where
[3:10:33.040 --> 3:10:37.840]  actually they formed a government that's functioning they have a functioning government they have a
[3:10:37.840 --> 3:10:43.200]  what we would consider a democracy um and it's the only one functioning right now it is the only
[3:10:43.200 --> 3:10:49.520]  military capable of standing up for themselves uh that we've seen because the iraqis all ran
[3:10:50.080 --> 3:10:54.560]  uh when they faced the first conflicts took forever to get them back on track for their own country
[3:10:55.200 --> 3:11:02.240]  now this is my primary objection to being in these areas right now 10 years of
[3:11:02.240 --> 3:11:09.840]  of constant fighting with american men and women who were trained in 10 weeks and then sent over
[3:11:09.840 --> 3:11:15.600]  there and they stay and they fight and they go back and they go back and they go back when
[3:11:15.600 --> 3:11:20.800]  traditionally one or two tours of duty in in these kinds of environments was normal for our
[3:11:20.800 --> 3:11:25.360]  military now it's repetitive and then we forget them when they come back to this country forget
[3:11:25.360 --> 3:11:30.560]  about the veterans you forget about what we've done and the impact on them and their families
[3:11:30.560 --> 3:11:37.840]  fundamentally wrong again if we use our warriors and america's mind in a country
[3:11:37.840 --> 3:11:43.760]  two things need to happen one is it really have to reflect american interests that's you and me
[3:11:43.760 --> 3:11:50.480]  not corporate interests but you and me and it has to translate into defense of our homes
[3:11:50.480 --> 3:11:56.400]  which is what the constitution talks about not about imposing our will on others defense
[3:11:56.400 --> 3:12:04.640]  of our country and our interests here now not somewhere else the other question uh in syria
[3:12:04.640 --> 3:12:09.040]  right now the Kurds are there now what happens if we pull out what are we worried about we're
[3:12:09.040 --> 3:12:16.560]  worried about our allies of nato country turkey stomping on that does that make sense i don't
[3:12:16.560 --> 3:12:24.640]  think so either you know i mean we should be able to cooperate with our allies right i mean allies
[3:12:24.640 --> 3:12:29.040]  or we ought to be able to interpret them more clearly as to whether they are our allies or
[3:12:29.040 --> 3:12:34.080]  they're not and and i'm not suggesting the turkish people aren't because i traveled to turkey i like
[3:12:34.080 --> 3:12:40.000]  turkey turkish people i meet are great people i've never met a turkish person traveling there that i
[3:12:40.000 --> 3:12:44.560]  that i didn't care for they have a different government than us and they're entitled to the
[3:12:44.560 --> 3:12:51.280]  government they have and it's not up to us to choose a poem when we go and look again at syria
[3:12:51.280 --> 3:12:57.360]  Assad we're all upset about Assad now Assad's been there for a few decades now this is his country
[3:12:57.360 --> 3:13:03.040]  they had a revolution however that started and he tried to suppress it and so he ended up with a
[3:13:03.040 --> 3:13:09.680]  civil war this is what happens when you want to change in government that's from the inside
[3:13:09.680 --> 3:13:16.880]  where changes in government should happen right from inside from the people outward that's the
[3:13:16.880 --> 3:13:23.440]  american way for the people of the people by the people those are our values other countries
[3:13:23.440 --> 3:13:27.760]  should have the same opportunity to choose their governments and i would suggest they do
[3:13:27.760 --> 3:13:33.600]  through the same vehicles that we did elections or revolution we chose revolution a few hundred
[3:13:33.600 --> 3:13:38.000]  years ago worked out fine and we've avoided it pretty much sense although you could call the
[3:13:38.000 --> 3:13:43.200]  civil war another revolution i would call it that because it was a big disagreement between our
[3:13:43.200 --> 3:13:50.160]  population that ultimately was settled militarily within the country to get us back to a form of
[3:13:50.160 --> 3:13:56.320]  democracy within a republic that the country could get back around and then we built from there
[3:13:56.320 --> 3:14:02.800]  again and we continue to build we continue to change we continue to grow in our view of ourselves
[3:14:02.800 --> 3:14:09.440]  as a as a people and how we view ourselves in the world when you think about syria today and
[3:14:09.440 --> 3:14:14.880]  what's happening there don trump has said it's time for us to move out perhaps it's time for
[3:14:14.880 --> 3:14:20.080]  the middle east to solve their issues on the road without us you know you look at europe and the
[3:14:20.080 --> 3:14:26.160]  immigration problem they have why aren't the saudis taking in these um these folks that are
[3:14:26.160 --> 3:14:30.640]  trying to find a place to live or key weight or some of the other middle eastern countries that
[3:14:30.640 --> 3:14:38.080]  aren't engaged in full blown war right now these are culturally similar certainly people can integrate
[3:14:38.080 --> 3:14:44.720]  more readily um and more importantly these are their brothers and sisters in their neighborhood
[3:14:44.720 --> 3:14:52.080]  for goodness sake um and again here we are in the middle east imposing our will or attempting to
[3:14:52.080 --> 3:14:56.560]  and at a time when now donald trump is saying hey you know what enough blood's been spilled we've
[3:14:56.560 --> 3:15:03.440]  been here long enough you guys figure it out and perhaps that's the right answer thinking about iraq

[3:15:08.480 --> 3:15:16.400]  went there for weapons mass destruction that weren't there right we spent a trillion dollars to find
[3:15:16.400 --> 3:15:24.240]  something that wasn't there that our intelligence community supposedly told us was there a trillion
[3:15:24.240 --> 3:15:30.000]  dollar error has anybody been held accountable for that error i don't think so i mean you could
[3:15:30.000 --> 3:15:34.160]  say the election process took care of it well the first time we've seen a move in the right

[3:18:19.760 --> 3:18:25.920]  globalist programming everybody knows who studies this that it's christians real christians who tend
[3:18:25.920 --> 3:18:32.080]  to be immune to the globalist brainwashing and who tend to see it and that's why they're trying to
[3:18:32.080 --> 3:18:39.600]  eradicate you but regardless this fight is intensifying 2018 has been insane 2019 is going to

[3:19:00.320 --> 3:19:05.520]  opposition if there's any independent media they can call the fact that the emperor has no
[3:19:05.520 --> 3:19:11.440]  clothes they can call bs it's game over but if you look at everybody else like michael savage
[3:19:11.440 --> 3:19:15.920]  and russia limbaugh and tucker carlson and sean hennedy they are all beholded to the networks
[3:19:15.920 --> 3:19:22.800]  they're on they can be targeted there's only two groups in the us info wars and matt rudge of
[3:19:22.800 --> 3:19:28.080]  drudge report dot com that are truly independent and of course they're two of the dominant media
[3:19:28.080 --> 3:19:34.400]  forces in the world it really is amazing that's why is we closed out 2018 i want to just remind
[3:19:34.400 --> 3:19:38.400]  the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together just remind you
[3:19:38.400 --> 3:19:44.560]  that you are the power you're the strength or the will of info wars so please spread the links
[3:19:44.560 --> 3:19:49.120]  info wars dot com news wars dot com prism pitta dot com because if you don't spread the articles
[3:19:49.120 --> 3:19:53.760]  the video is no one else will we're all in each other's hands god bless you all and thank you
[3:19:53.760 --> 3:19:59.680]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:20:10.160 --> 3:20:20.640]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones and now your host nick baggage
[3:20:20.640 --> 3:20:27.120]  and welcome back to info wars dot com it's a pleasure to be here and i'm actually traveling
[3:20:27.120 --> 3:20:31.280]  again this week i'm in southern california i want to remind people that uh our website
[3:20:31.280 --> 3:20:38.560]  or pulse dot com e a r t h p u l s c dot com and i know we're just a few days before uh the
[3:20:38.560 --> 3:20:45.600]  holidays and christmas and i i just really um want to wish everyone uh truly uh merry christmas i
[3:20:45.600 --> 3:20:51.600]  know there's a lot of things going on in the world today that every reason to be stressed
[3:20:51.600 --> 3:20:59.200]  uptight anxious even um but take these next few days and take a breath uh be with your families
[3:20:59.200 --> 3:21:07.280]  be with your friends um think about uh what we can be and let's be that in the new year you know
[3:21:07.280 --> 3:21:12.880]  there's a lot uh in the world that we can all complain about we can all see and the thing about
[3:21:12.880 --> 3:21:18.480]  these particular times in our history these are the times where we test our metal we find out what
[3:21:18.480 --> 3:21:24.640]  americans truly are and i think we're at a point where we're going to see lots of traumas uh in the
[3:21:24.640 --> 3:21:30.800]  world if you will but those are the things that give us the opportunity to reshape reform ourselves
[3:21:30.800 --> 3:21:35.520]  and how we reflect uh in the world around us and the challenges that we're facing today are really
[3:21:35.520 --> 3:21:42.240]  the big ones the base value judgments about what we are as a people and how we want to project in
[3:21:42.240 --> 3:21:48.160]  the world and i think that's what we're seeing when we see these exodus from the trump administration
[3:21:48.160 --> 3:21:55.040]  that would like to keep the order the same and and those that see this new world order as really the
[3:21:55.040 --> 3:22:01.840]  adversary of the average human being whether you're here or somewhere else on the planet
[3:22:01.840 --> 3:22:09.040]  and when we start to look at what drives these things we find behind all of it is always some
[3:22:09.040 --> 3:22:16.160]  deep economic interest that is not yours in mind and ultimately these wars are fought over interests
[3:22:16.160 --> 3:22:24.800]  that are not yours in mind let's think about in the 80s oil was a a shortage in the us and the
[3:22:24.800 --> 3:22:30.720]  shortage was because they didn't have the will to produce just in the last month the biggest oil
[3:22:30.720 --> 3:22:39.840]  basin maybe in the world has been discovered in west texas and new mexico with billions and billions
[3:22:39.840 --> 3:22:44.560]  of barrels of oil uh discovered north soap of alaska we've talked about another segment
[3:22:44.560 --> 3:22:49.520]  so i'd encourage people to look at some of our past broadcasts on uh the national resources in
[3:22:49.520 --> 3:22:56.960]  alaska but again thinking about oil as a driver we are now the united states a net exporter we
[3:22:56.960 --> 3:23:04.240]  are exporting oil again first time in decades the oil demand in the us actually is relatively
[3:23:04.240 --> 3:23:09.840]  stable and perhaps declining primarily because of the advent of electric cars and the shift
[3:23:10.480 --> 3:23:16.960]  to other fuel sources and that trend is going to continue where the big demand is for oil
[3:23:16.960 --> 3:23:22.080]  and gas is growing is the middle east coming out of the middle east is for european markets
[3:23:22.080 --> 3:23:29.360]  and for markets in in asia and when you think about european interest i mean germany is getting
[3:23:29.360 --> 3:23:34.640]  its natural gas primarily from russia who they want to make their adversary i don't understand
[3:23:34.640 --> 3:23:40.880]  that on the one hand you you define yourself in terms of your energy footprint by the russians
[3:23:40.880 --> 3:23:44.880]  and on the other hand you want to make from your adversary i don't get that it doesn't make a lot
[3:23:44.880 --> 3:23:50.720]  of sense to me i think the russian's big interest is to make money i think that's obvious to everybody
[3:23:50.720 --> 3:23:55.680]  um it's not to go out and engage in a bunch of foreign wars they're engaged in syria
[3:23:56.240 --> 3:24:02.880]  because it's one of the few places they actually have a foreign base um and so i get that i understand
[3:24:02.880 --> 3:24:08.560]  that um but i do not believe the soviet uh former soviet union might have been our enemy
[3:24:09.120 --> 3:24:12.800]  but i don't think russia is our enemy today i think there's interest i would like to keep it
[3:24:12.800 --> 3:24:18.560]  that way there's interest i would like to build militaries to defend against some adversary and
[3:24:18.560 --> 3:24:24.560]  the real adversary i would look a little bit more uh ideologically to where the problems are and that
[3:24:24.560 --> 3:24:30.880]  would be chinese uh government which is still a declared communist government they're still totally
[3:24:30.880 --> 3:24:37.360]  authoritarian they dominate their people as if they were their own serfs and slaves and and yet
[3:24:37.360 --> 3:24:43.520]  somehow we kind of miss the point and why do we miss the point because us companies are making
[3:24:43.520 --> 3:24:49.360]  billions of dollars saddling up to those that ideologically don't share our values that's how
[3:24:49.360 --> 3:24:55.920]  corporate interests work but that's not how democracies should function when you go back
[3:24:56.480 --> 3:25:03.200]  in time when when companies start to run governments uh we have big problems and in a broadcast i
[3:25:03.200 --> 3:25:09.520]  did recently on on one of the affiliates alex's affiliates uh we were dealing with this issue
[3:25:09.520 --> 3:25:16.000]  you know sort of where do you draw the lines and this is where in one sense the internet has
[3:25:16.000 --> 3:25:21.840]  liberated us and giving us access to information but at the same time um has restricted us in terms
[3:25:21.840 --> 3:25:28.400]  of how we use our information so here we are in the 21st century more knowledge available to us
[3:25:28.400 --> 3:25:34.320]  than ever in the history of humankind at least in terms of the world uh and and yet those that
[3:25:34.320 --> 3:25:41.920]  control the dial and want to turn off the broadcast for everyone's best interest because
[3:25:41.920 --> 3:25:48.640]  somebody sees better than us i don't think so and again info wars has been banned from a number of
[3:25:48.640 --> 3:25:56.640]  networks um it's been banned for what i think are all of the wrong reasons um there is no reason to
[3:25:56.640 --> 3:26:05.280]  ban someone uh from speaking uh freely in this country when the real story is debate healthy
[3:26:05.280 --> 3:26:12.800]  public debate is what changes things a monopoly on free speeches not the answer it doesn't serve a
[3:26:12.800 --> 3:26:18.720]  democracy well in fact the first amendment when it was passed freedom of speech freedom of religion
[3:26:18.720 --> 3:26:24.400]  freedom of the press very very foundational but what did freedom of the press really mean
[3:26:24.400 --> 3:26:30.480]  didn't mean just say whatever you want anyway you want in fact that would never been tolerated
[3:26:31.040 --> 3:26:38.640]  what was required was engage the people use the media as a free way to talk to speak freely say
[3:26:38.640 --> 3:26:44.160]  whatever you want the king can't shut your voice down and neither should anyone else because speech
[3:26:44.800 --> 3:26:50.880]  is simple if you don't like what you're hearing today in the modern world you just change the
[3:26:50.880 --> 3:26:57.920]  channel in the old days you could leave the room you know you could actually exit the town square
[3:26:58.960 --> 3:27:05.600]  but the point was to have this kind of invigorated debate the kind that causes you to push your
[3:27:05.600 --> 3:27:10.960]  envelope to the edge and to learn and to be able to build a country based on knowledge
[3:27:10.960 --> 3:27:18.720]  understanding and wisdom those three elements combined this is something that uh freedom of
[3:27:18.720 --> 3:27:24.640]  the press doesn't guarantee but it certainly opens door for the possibility but we constrain
[3:27:24.640 --> 3:27:31.680]  speech for political reasons for cultural reasons social reasons for any reason uh fundamentally
[3:27:31.680 --> 3:27:39.120]  we have stepped way way far to the wrong side of the equation in a government should reflect free
[3:27:39.120 --> 3:27:45.360]  thinking um and an ability to come to consensus and that consensus comes from reasonable public
[3:27:45.360 --> 3:27:52.640]  debate and and again you know info wars um is about providing information and I know sometimes
[3:27:52.640 --> 3:27:58.640]  everybody gets really excited and I appreciate that quite frankly uh everybody has a style
[3:27:58.640 --> 3:28:04.480]  that we use to convey our information it's just who we are Alex is way different than me
[3:28:04.480 --> 3:28:12.160]  Owen is way different than me um but together uh we are a voice um on the base set of values
[3:28:12.160 --> 3:28:16.960]  that we share in common and this is the important aspect again going into the holiday season that
[3:28:16.960 --> 3:28:22.480]  we need to remember it's as different as we all are including within our families we can embrace
[3:28:22.480 --> 3:28:28.400]  each other so the brothers and sisters and still disagree on many many things that's the American
[3:28:28.400 --> 3:28:33.520]  character those are the values um that we should be remembering during this holiday season and
[3:28:33.520 --> 3:28:39.120]  demonstrating with our families and friends we'll be right back we've got a break coming up and uh
[3:28:39.120 --> 3:28:44.000]  I just appreciate being here and wishing everyone again a whole happy holidays uh coming into the

[3:31:09.200 --> 3:31:13.600]  but if you look at everybody else like michael savage and russia lembaugh and tugger carlson
[3:31:13.600 --> 3:31:18.560]  and sean hannity they are all beholded to the networks they're on they can be targeted there's

[3:32:06.560 --> 3:32:12.160]  the dead and recognizing it's being persecuted that's all because you are the core listening to
[3:32:12.160 --> 3:32:19.360]  info wars around the world the eyes and ears of liberty that were immune or at least resistant
[3:32:19.360 --> 3:32:25.280]  to the globalist programming everybody knows who studies this that it's christians real christians
[3:32:25.280 --> 3:32:31.360]  who tend to be immune to the globalist brainwashing and and and who tend to see it and that's why
[3:32:31.360 --> 3:32:38.160]  they're trying to eradicate you but regardless this fight is intensifying 2018 has been insane
[3:32:38.160 --> 3:32:44.400]  2019 is going to be the big decision maker and i am so honored to be here with you right beside me
[3:32:45.120 --> 3:32:48.960]  not behind us but right beside us and at the heart of everything resisting these globalists so
[3:32:48.960 --> 3:32:53.040]  whatever you do take action realize we're changing history together and i salute you
[3:32:53.040 --> 3:33:08.960]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:33:08.960 --> 3:33:25.360]  and welcome back to info wars dot com it's a pleasure to be with uh everyone here today and
[3:33:25.360 --> 3:33:31.280]  you know i had a chance um last week i was in uh in austin for the week we did uh seven different
[3:33:31.280 --> 3:33:37.040]  segments over that week and um got to meet a lot of the folks that were here and i had a chance
[3:33:37.040 --> 3:33:45.760]  and got to meet a lot of the folks in the studios and the team behind the team and i just got to
[3:33:45.760 --> 3:33:51.520]  say it's the best i've ever worked with we're truly committed people every time that you support
[3:33:51.520 --> 3:33:57.280]  this network network you're supporting them and that make it all possible and and i i just want
[3:33:57.280 --> 3:34:02.320]  to say thanks to them too during this holiday seasons and i would ask listeners remember this
[3:34:02.320 --> 3:34:08.320]  network um hold them in your prayers and financially support them where you can it's a great team
[3:34:09.040 --> 3:34:14.000]  and one of the very best i work with around the world and i work with over 200 production teams
[3:34:14.640 --> 3:34:22.000]  in the last 25 years and by far this is as good or better than any including the major
[3:34:22.000 --> 3:34:28.960]  networks that i've seen so i appreciate it on the screen is some of the products and books that uh
[3:34:28.960 --> 3:34:34.400]  that i produce um that are carried at the info store um i really encourage people to take a
[3:34:34.400 --> 3:34:39.280]  look there it supports me it also supports the network and so you get a three for one actually
[3:34:39.280 --> 3:34:44.240]  you help me you help alex uh and you help yourself by getting more informed on issues uh that are
[3:34:44.240 --> 3:34:50.800]  important to all of us and i appreciate it you know i think this is a time of year uh to remember
[3:34:50.800 --> 3:34:56.000]  those things that that we do appreciate about a living in this country and about our families
[3:34:56.000 --> 3:35:02.080]  and friends we got a quiet weekend coming up um we're going to have four days hopefully of nothing
[3:35:02.080 --> 3:35:09.520]  too crazy in the world so we can uh really get into the break and and take a breath as we move
[3:35:09.520 --> 3:35:15.280]  forward um forward into the new year um jumping into this segment a little bit i want to talk about
[3:35:16.880 --> 3:35:23.040]  sort of the the scene behind the scene as you start to think about uh what drives all of this
[3:35:23.040 --> 3:35:28.000]  and economies and money and the things that drive multinationals and and i want to talk
[3:35:28.000 --> 3:35:34.160]  about that from this this perspective right now in the last week we've seen the stock market taking
[3:35:34.160 --> 3:35:39.440]  some serious uh dives and people are getting concerned and once again they want to blame
[3:35:39.440 --> 3:35:45.040]  donald trump and and let me tell you exactly why the market is going down has nothing to do with
[3:35:45.040 --> 3:35:49.600]  donald trump it has to do with the federal reserve which most of the listeners to this
[3:35:49.600 --> 3:35:56.080]  broadcast know the federal reserve is not a federal agency it's a consortium of 300 banks
[3:35:56.880 --> 3:36:04.160]  member banks that set the interest rates in the nation in europe they have the central bank of
[3:36:04.160 --> 3:36:09.840]  europe doing essentially the same thing for the eu these are bankers these are not government
[3:36:09.840 --> 3:36:16.960]  employees they're bankers who have been given the authority to print the script if you will now i
[3:36:16.960 --> 3:36:23.280]  want to talk about money supply because this is what everyone's trying to constrain by raising
[3:36:23.280 --> 3:36:28.880]  interest rates the federal reserve believes that the economy is overheated that we're facing inflation
[3:36:28.880 --> 3:36:34.560]  so what do they do they jack the rates up they've done them four times in the last year now what is
[3:36:34.560 --> 3:36:39.600]  what's who's the biggest impact who's get the biggest impact to those interest rate rises
[3:36:39.600 --> 3:36:48.160]  all of us who have interest uh in anything which is the government debt stop and think about it
[3:36:48.160 --> 3:36:54.480]  for a moment this debt is rolled over every couple years every couple months every day
[3:36:54.480 --> 3:37:01.760]  for that matter and as it rolls over the higher rates who's going to pay those rates you and me
[3:37:01.760 --> 3:37:07.680]  through taxation the biggest impact to the federal budget is a non-federal agency jack and the rate
[3:37:07.680 --> 3:37:14.880]  up and they say it's to constrain the money supply this is total nonsense is total bs that
[3:37:14.880 --> 3:37:21.680]  they want to tell you as fertilizer it's still bs and here's why when you look at the money supply
[3:37:21.680 --> 3:37:30.880]  in the 21st century it is not currency or coin like it used to be pre 1960 before the advent
[3:37:30.880 --> 3:37:35.200]  of credit cards i mean they start a little bit before that but they didn't really take off
[3:37:35.200 --> 3:37:43.760]  but when you look at money supply is cash in all forms in circulation so you have m1 which is cash
[3:37:43.760 --> 3:37:51.760]  and you have m2 m3 m4 m5 they used to break it down from bank loans to credit cards to debt
[3:37:51.760 --> 3:37:58.560]  instruments to bonds and you they break it all down but they don't break it down anymore and they
[3:37:58.560 --> 3:38:04.000]  give you the illusion that somehow money supply matters i don't think it really does unless you
[3:38:04.000 --> 3:38:10.400]  have a shortage of either services or goods which we don't because think about this is basic economics
[3:38:10.400 --> 3:38:16.720]  here's the basic economic lesson for for for friday we have four factors of economic production
[3:38:16.720 --> 3:38:22.800]  this is the real things in the economy it's labor that's you and me our work it's entrepreneurship
[3:38:22.800 --> 3:38:28.480]  that's the creativity that builds businesses it's land and natural resources which is obvious
[3:38:28.480 --> 3:38:33.520]  to everyone and then it's what's called capital but in this sense it's not money capital is things
[3:38:33.520 --> 3:38:37.920]  that make other things that build things like factories that build tractors or factories that
[3:38:37.920 --> 3:38:44.960]  build shovels you know these are this is capital now in between each of these things is cash or
[3:38:44.960 --> 3:38:50.400]  credit what facilitates the trade between and there it is right on the screen the factors of
[3:38:50.400 --> 3:38:57.440]  production this is the real meat of economies in between these is money that allows you to trade
[3:38:57.440 --> 3:39:03.600]  without trading pigs for land or you know bartering we can't barter so we form currency
[3:39:03.600 --> 3:39:10.560]  that we have some confidence in and then we have the illusion that somehow the federal reserve jack
[3:39:10.560 --> 3:39:16.400]  and the rate up will constrain business and it and it does i mean it moves money out of the
[3:39:16.400 --> 3:39:23.680]  stock market into bonds and securities because you can get a higher rate reliable yield so if
[3:39:23.680 --> 3:39:28.800]  you're a retirement fund you want to get a reliable yield for your beneficiaries so when
[3:39:28.800 --> 3:39:33.280]  interest rates start to climb you move your money out of the market which is big speculation the
[3:39:33.280 --> 3:39:39.040]  lesser speculation where the rates are more contained and controlled and in my lifetime i
[3:39:39.040 --> 3:39:45.760]  remember at credit unions we used to get seven percent wow if you get seven percent on your money
[3:39:45.760 --> 3:39:52.320]  now retirement funds would be doing really really good but the you know again you pay on one side
[3:39:52.320 --> 3:39:57.360]  and you pay on the other so you got to kind of look at a balance and that's what is attempted
[3:39:57.360 --> 3:40:03.200]  supposedly theoretically by the federal reserve but really it's more about they say it's not
[3:40:03.200 --> 3:40:07.760]  political come on now then why are you blaming donald trump or something he has absolutely zero
[3:40:07.760 --> 3:40:13.120]  control over the fed the only thing he gets to do is select a fed chairman occasionally the president
[3:40:13.120 --> 3:40:17.920]  gets to figure this out the congress gets to ratify but aside from that it's not happening
[3:40:17.920 --> 3:40:23.200]  you know the last guy that wanted to sort of turn the fed off and move it back to the federal
[3:40:23.200 --> 3:40:29.520]  government was john f kennedy and we all saw what happened to him a few months later poof he's gone
[3:40:29.520 --> 3:40:34.480]  his brother thought it was a good idea too and a few months later poof he's gone you know the
[3:40:34.480 --> 3:40:41.600]  bankers really want to maintain control of the money because then they can jack us around and
[3:40:41.600 --> 3:40:47.120]  control government outcomes they can get rid of politicians by just crashing economies you know this
[3:40:47.120 --> 3:40:53.120]  was uh it reminds me of this other situation you know when you think about crashing economies how
[3:40:53.120 --> 3:40:59.440]  does the us use its might against small governments we go in and we manipulate their currency we go
[3:40:59.440 --> 3:41:04.640]  in and we we dump a bunch of their currency on devalue it caused them to have all kinds of
[3:41:04.640 --> 3:41:10.800]  internal problems we do this deliberately to manipulate other governments you know the one
[3:41:10.800 --> 3:41:21.200]  of the very few governments we can't do that with ecuador why ecuador well since about 2002
[3:41:21.200 --> 3:41:27.200]  they adopted the us dollar as their national currency so when they put a sage in their embassy
[3:41:27.200 --> 3:41:34.000]  in london we couldn't force ecuador this little teeny country in latin america we couldn't force
[3:41:34.000 --> 3:41:41.120]  them to buckle to the us will and let us arrest this guy who blew the whistle incidentally on some
[3:41:41.120 --> 3:41:46.800]  of the biggest scandals that american public had a right to see you know and most listeners to this
[3:41:46.800 --> 3:41:52.080]  broadcast believe that there needs to be some balance and whistleblowing to make our government
[3:41:52.080 --> 3:41:59.120]  accountable in the age of invisible government come on uh but why couldn't they do anything
[3:41:59.120 --> 3:42:04.800]  because ecuador has the us dollar i traveled ecuador for time to time and i can tell you
[3:42:04.800 --> 3:42:10.320]  something else they did that i was very impressed um when the world bank came to them and said we
[3:42:10.320 --> 3:42:16.400]  want half of your taxes and you got to raise them because we want our money you know what the ecuadorian
[3:42:16.400 --> 3:42:23.440]  said go pound salt you can't have half we'll give you 20 and the rest we're going to put in an
[3:42:23.440 --> 3:42:31.120]  infrastructure and they put it in first to health care second to education third to water and sewer
[3:42:31.120 --> 3:42:37.120]  systems and fourth to roads and transportation that's the way they interpreted um infrastructure
[3:42:37.120 --> 3:42:42.720]  coming back after this break i want to get into that a little bit because independence is what's
[3:42:42.720 --> 3:42:48.320]  required around the world not dominance by any this is dr nick baggots and we'll be right back

[3:43:14.080 --> 3:43:18.480]  pretty good but hard to source and the globalist tried to block us getting a supply of it so we
[3:43:18.480 --> 3:43:23.840]  discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you x2 that's been incredible
[3:43:24.480 --> 3:43:29.840]  now due to the establishment trying to block that we did more research and secured more of the deep
[3:43:29.840 --> 3:43:35.040]  earth crystals of nascent iodine but chemists scientists and others showed us the research
[3:43:35.040 --> 3:43:41.840]  that by combining it with three other compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin c it super charges it
[3:43:41.840 --> 3:43:47.840]  and makes it even more bio available ladies and gentlemen you want to research it you want to see

[3:47:10.960 --> 3:47:24.480]  you can run home and welcome back this is dr nick baggage december 21st 2018 in the
[3:47:24.480 --> 3:47:29.520]  fourth hour standing in for alex and i just appreciate everyone on the team and i want
[3:47:29.520 --> 3:47:35.120]  to remind people to support the network take a look at the info store take a look at all the
[3:47:35.120 --> 3:47:39.920]  things that are there that allow us to get information out to you and we appreciate
[3:47:39.920 --> 3:47:47.600]  that and you know breaking off that last segment you know thinking again of what's been built you
[3:47:47.600 --> 3:47:52.720]  know and sort of how does it tie together you know and that's a lot of what i tried to do
[3:47:52.720 --> 3:47:57.280]  during these programs is try to bring all of this into some form so you can kind of see the bigger
[3:47:58.160 --> 3:48:03.520]  picture of it and how it how it weaves together and we were talking a little bit about the
[3:48:03.520 --> 3:48:07.520]  middle east today we've talked a little bit about china and russia and what the real interests are
[3:48:07.520 --> 3:48:11.920]  and then we've talked a little bit about sort of the what drives all this which is the money
[3:48:11.920 --> 3:48:19.440]  behind the system and what's real in terms of things that are concrete and solid not the ether
[3:48:19.440 --> 3:48:25.840]  in between the fiat currency that that ties it together but think about cash as a control mechanism
[3:48:25.840 --> 3:48:31.840]  if you will and and as a way to not just manipulate overall economies but ultimately a way to
[3:48:31.840 --> 3:48:37.920]  manipulate individuals and think about how much cash do you really spend in the economy i mean
[3:48:37.920 --> 3:48:44.880]  hard currency money you know dollar bills not very much most people they put it on their debit card
[3:48:44.880 --> 3:48:51.040]  they put it on their credit card they put it on their discount card but ultimately all of that
[3:48:51.040 --> 3:48:56.240]  data is collected the credit card companies now have it they know your purchases where you buy
[3:48:56.240 --> 3:49:03.040]  stuff what your basic patterns are all of this integration of data is what gives a clear profile
[3:49:03.040 --> 3:49:07.760]  of you when you look at my check register in my checkbooks i actually still use a checkbook
[3:49:07.760 --> 3:49:12.000]  which they also track all of that when you get your statement you see the photographs of your
[3:49:12.000 --> 3:49:17.360]  checks but they're pretty limited you know seven or eight checks a month and the rest i pretty much
[3:49:17.360 --> 3:49:24.720]  do cash um as a matter of a pattern um i kind of feel better that way uh knowing that at least
[3:49:24.720 --> 3:49:29.360]  my buying and selling and that full profile of me is a little bit limited although we really
[3:49:29.360 --> 3:49:34.080]  can't escape it very much and when you see the trends that are happening and i and i talked
[3:49:34.080 --> 3:49:41.280]  about this in a segment a week or two ago to tie a few things together you have india with
[3:49:41.280 --> 3:49:46.720]  over a billion people in fact about about a billion three most people don't realize it but
[3:49:46.720 --> 3:49:53.360]  they've done biometrics on their entire population now with a few millions left to find but they took
[3:49:53.360 --> 3:50:01.120]  facial recognition scans iris scans and then fingerprints because in india a lot of people
[3:50:01.120 --> 3:50:06.560]  don't have fingerprints eye diseases are so common lot of them don't have the ability to get an iris
[3:50:06.560 --> 3:50:13.920]  scan so the three combined is what they did now what happened in india and is they decided to
[3:50:13.920 --> 3:50:20.080]  start to stomp out the cryptocurrencies because they were being used for funneling uh illegal money
[3:50:20.080 --> 3:50:24.640]  illegal money and so they said all the banks can't take cryptocurrency and then the next
[3:50:24.640 --> 3:50:31.600]  thing they did is they eliminated 1000 and 2000 rupee notes now these were the bank notes and put
[3:50:31.600 --> 3:50:37.200]  that in perspective there's 70 rupees to a dollar so 70 is you know not a lot of money when you think
[3:50:37.200 --> 3:50:43.440]  of a thousand rupees you know that's very little money you know 15 bucks or whatever it is so
[3:50:43.440 --> 3:50:50.080]  so what they did by taking those out of circulation those were the currency denominations that
[3:50:50.080 --> 3:50:56.800]  represented the biggest pot of bribery money so they gave everybody 30 days to turn in their notes
[3:50:56.800 --> 3:51:02.640]  and explain where they got them or they were worthless the next day they were became worthless
[3:51:02.640 --> 3:51:09.280]  and so this was the first attempt but that when you combine the biometrics with the elimination
[3:51:09.280 --> 3:51:15.200]  of this and what their interest is and the reason they did the biometrics is all social services
[3:51:15.760 --> 3:51:21.840]  all distributions of the government will be handled only electronically and the the intention
[3:51:21.840 --> 3:51:29.360]  is is to move all of their financial transactions even to the poorest poorest of the poor to digital
[3:51:30.480 --> 3:51:38.640]  currency to eliminate bribery is what they're doing it for and the fact is they will eliminate a
[3:51:38.640 --> 3:51:43.760]  great deal of bribery except in the very high levels where the big payoffs occur that are going
[3:51:43.760 --> 3:51:48.960]  to continue to occur what they've eliminated is a big chunk of corrupt corruption at lower levels
[3:51:48.960 --> 3:51:54.560]  and then able to capture that tax base to fuel in to paying off the world bank and the bankers
[3:51:54.560 --> 3:51:59.520]  because that's really what it's about because the world bank comes in as they did in Ecuador
[3:51:59.520 --> 3:52:04.000]  only in Ecuador where they use the US dollar they had no leverage because they couldn't
[3:52:04.000 --> 3:52:10.320]  crash their economy they couldn't manipulate their currency and so they were able to sustain
[3:52:10.880 --> 3:52:16.000]  and reset their infrastructure now when I went down there what I was impressed by first of all
[3:52:16.000 --> 3:52:22.640]  the medical care their first step at infrastructure improvement is second to none in terms of quality
[3:52:22.640 --> 3:52:29.760]  and efficiency it is rated higher than the United States not by a little bit but by Bloomberg it's
[3:52:29.760 --> 3:52:36.320]  rated in the 20s whereas the US is rated in the 40s in terms of ranking according to the world
[3:52:36.320 --> 3:52:44.400]  health organization the same situation Ecuador in the 20s the US in the in the 40s the other part
[3:52:44.400 --> 3:52:50.720]  of that is is how much of your economy do you spend on medical in Ecuador 7.7% in the US it's a
[3:52:50.720 --> 3:52:58.160]  little over 18% or almost a fifth of the economy you know yet they do a better job with less money
[3:52:58.160 --> 3:53:04.080]  and I've availed myself to the Ecuadorian dental care I can tell you I got the best dental work
[3:53:04.080 --> 3:53:09.920]  I've ever had in my life and I could actually afford it and I'm sad to say in my part of the
[3:53:09.920 --> 3:53:17.200]  world I can't it's too expensive in Alaska when I when I think about infrastructure as a second
[3:53:17.200 --> 3:53:23.040]  tier for the Ecuadorians was education and what did I see as I as I went around the country
[3:53:23.040 --> 3:53:29.840]  where a whole lot of these one two and four year programs that were geared around their oil
[3:53:29.840 --> 3:53:36.080]  industry their manufacturing sector their textile industry agriculture things that they're actually
[3:53:36.080 --> 3:53:42.000]  doing in the country and they built an education system to train workers for those higher paying
[3:53:42.000 --> 3:53:47.920]  jobs so they're not importing workers who have those higher skills so that was their second tier
[3:53:47.920 --> 3:53:53.040]  so first tier health second tier education third tier water and sewer for obvious reasons because
[3:53:53.040 --> 3:53:58.080]  that of course has a big impact on your health and on your education and on your general way of being
[3:53:58.080 --> 3:54:05.200]  and then the fourth was road system and the road systems they built lot of mortal roads to offset
[3:54:05.200 --> 3:54:13.200]  the cost of construction and a way to pay for it that they could afford to engage at the local level
[3:54:13.200 --> 3:54:19.120]  now the other thing I saw there is huge amount of investment foreign investment coming in
[3:54:19.120 --> 3:54:25.120]  because it's relatively stable they haven't had any wars since 2002 most of what you see around
[3:54:25.120 --> 3:54:30.080]  the country are police academies for internal policing not military academies although they're
[3:54:30.080 --> 3:54:37.840]  there also again thinking about the world bank and what they would really like to do is have one
[3:54:37.840 --> 3:54:45.200]  currency where the bankers can manipulate everyone and this is what this trend is headed towards when
[3:54:45.200 --> 3:54:52.720]  you look at China and what they have done in terms of the transparency program for the average
[3:54:52.720 --> 3:54:59.520]  population by insisting that the very networks the very organizations have banned this program in
[3:54:59.520 --> 3:55:08.400]  full wars modified their programs to appease communist China that was Google YouTube Facebook
[3:55:08.400 --> 3:55:14.560]  all of them essentially had to have a system that was fully monitored by the Chinese government
[3:55:14.560 --> 3:55:19.600]  for their social scoring which many have already heard about but this is where they actually rank
[3:55:19.600 --> 3:55:27.760]  you not like a credit score but how you behave on the internet and elsewhere and they decide
[3:55:27.760 --> 3:55:31.920]  whether you get a passport whether you get good housing or bad housing whether you go to college
[3:55:31.920 --> 3:55:38.800]  your kids go to college or whether you're relegated to some subservient lifestyle based on your
[3:55:38.800 --> 3:55:46.000]  behavior now these us companies that made it possible to further enslave over a billion people
[3:55:46.000 --> 3:55:50.160]  in China are the very ones that are sitting in congress telling us to limit our speech
[3:55:50.160 --> 3:55:59.200]  fundamentally wrong an attack on freedom an attack on humankind on human beings and these
[3:55:59.200 --> 3:56:07.440]  companies have set up systems to strip the humanity out of these folks and using technology
[3:56:07.440 --> 3:56:15.920]  to do it over 25 years ago i started talking about this the technocracy that was emerging
[3:56:15.920 --> 3:56:26.000]  in this century and it is here now it is so here now that if we don't put a wrench in the bicycle
[3:56:26.000 --> 3:56:34.480]  spokes this is going downhill too fast and it's about freedom of speech even when people are offended
[3:56:34.480 --> 3:56:40.240]  we should be able to say what we think we should not feel like we cannot speak from our heart
[3:56:40.240 --> 3:56:46.880]  from the center of our soul even if people disagree and we can be wrong and when we are wrong we
[3:56:46.880 --> 3:56:53.200]  should be responsible and we should be accountable and we should be big enough to acknowledge when
[3:56:53.200 --> 3:56:59.200]  we're wrong but the engagement has to happen restricting speech is not an engagement it's a
[3:56:59.200 --> 3:57:06.080]  divorce from the very principles that we stand together on this is christmas time my family
[3:57:06.080 --> 3:57:10.640]  usually gets together this time of year and the baggage family political debate begins
[3:57:11.200 --> 3:57:16.880]  and at the end of the debate we still embrace each other as americans as family members
[3:57:16.880 --> 3:57:21.440]  because we're here to do the same thing every one of us is here to do do our bit to change the
[3:57:21.440 --> 3:57:26.560]  world make it better for our grandchildren people we haven't even met yet and that's what this is
[3:57:26.560 --> 3:57:31.040]  about that's what we've all been about in this last year i thank you for listening and supporting
[3:57:31.040 --> 3:57:37.680]  this network this is dr nick baggage signing off for the 21st of december 2018 thanks for being here
[3:57:43.040 --> 3:57:48.160]  for those of us that are the tip of the spear we're being targeted to take out the leadership
[3:57:48.160 --> 3:57:53.120]  that's the globalist only hope so when you support info wars when you spread our articles and videos

[3:58:01.920 --> 3:58:07.520]  but you are standing for your own future and your own best shot of having an early warning system
[3:58:07.520 --> 3:58:11.680]  in america to stand against these individuals when you order products at info wars store dot com
[3:58:11.680 --> 3:58:16.160]  you fund not just an american revolution but a global revolution against tyranny and we have

[3:58:44.400 --> 3:58:48.880]  the globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the law
[3:58:49.920 --> 3:58:55.600]  if there's any opposition if there's any independent media they can call the fact that the emperor has
[3:58:55.600 --> 3:59:01.840]  no clothes they can call bs it's game over but if you look at everybody else like michael savage and
[3:59:01.840 --> 3:59:07.040]  russia limbaugh and tucker carlson and sean hennedy they are all beholded to the networks they're on
[3:59:07.040 --> 3:59:13.600]  they can be targeted there's only two groups in the us info wars and matt rudge of rudge report
[3:59:13.600 --> 3:59:18.880]  dot com that are truly independent and of course they're two of the dominant media forces in the
