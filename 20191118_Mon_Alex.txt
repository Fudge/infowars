[00:00.000 --> 00:18.800]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well so does he live
[00:18.800 --> 00:29.160]  from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones new questions this morning about president
[00:29.160 --> 00:35.600]  trump's health after he made a sudden unannounced unscheduled visit to walter read medical center
[00:35.600 --> 00:40.560]  over the weekend now the white house says it was regular testing as part of his annual
[00:40.560 --> 00:45.240]  physical but a source tells cnn the visit did not follow the usual protocol for a routine
[00:45.240 --> 00:50.960]  presidential exam cnn his chief medical correspondent dr sanjay gupa is live with us so sanjay
[00:50.960 --> 00:55.800]  what do you see here well i mean you know the the fact that it did not fit protocol follow
[00:55.800 --> 01:01.720]  protocol not only from previous administrations but from this administration in the past the
[01:01.720 --> 01:07.200]  white house did alert people that the president was going to have a physical exam it was planned
[01:07.200 --> 01:11.520]  as you might imagine it's a it's a big deal for the president to show up at the hospital
[01:11.520 --> 01:16.000]  doesn't sound like everyone at the hospital knew about this so there were several protocols
[01:16.000 --> 01:21.880]  that were were broken here also this idea that that he went in for the first phase of
[01:21.880 --> 01:28.000]  a physical exam that's typically very typically not how it's done in fact many of the things
[01:28.000 --> 01:33.440]  that they said he had done at walter read a physical exam basic lab work i think was
[01:33.440 --> 01:38.520]  was the the quote that can be done at the white house as well so it does sort of raise
[01:38.520 --> 01:43.400]  this question what was necessary at walter read that couldn't be done at the white house
[01:43.400 --> 01:50.040]  why was it being done a few months early stefanie grisham who's the president's spokesperson
[01:50.040 --> 01:55.720]  has said very clearly look this wasn't due to any new symptoms the president was having
[01:55.720 --> 01:59.780]  but i think any medical person that would be the first question they would ask patient
[01:59.780 --> 02:05.160]  shows up somewhat of an unannounced surprise visit to the hospital what's going on what
[02:05.160 --> 02:09.560]  prompted this visit we don't know the answer that we may never know the answer to that
[02:09.560 --> 02:14.480]  there's no requirement that the president the white house disclose that information so we
[02:14.480 --> 02:22.680]  may never know but it is it is really odd you know in terms of how this unfolded we're
[02:22.680 --> 02:31.280]  live it's november 18th monday 2019 i am your host alex jones thank you so much for joining
[02:31.280 --> 02:39.320]  us on this live monday broadcast well i went to bed last night at about nine o'clock and
[02:39.320 --> 02:43.600]  i woke up this morning and i had all these calls that i'd better check in with some of
[02:43.600 --> 02:52.680]  my sources concerning trump's unannounced unscheduled visit to a military hospital saturday and
[02:52.680 --> 02:56.440]  then i began to notice there was almost no coverage of it at first they'd mentioned it
[02:56.440 --> 03:01.760]  on sunday but then no coverage a blackout on it then i started making some phone calls
[03:01.760 --> 03:06.440]  back to the people that had called me and then i made more phone calls this morning
[03:06.440 --> 03:11.400]  and it's been quite the story in the background of the food testers and the fact that obviously
[03:11.400 --> 03:15.280]  the deep state wants to poison the president that's been going on to imperial leaders and
[03:15.280 --> 03:19.320]  presidents for as long as this country has been around of course for thousands of years
[03:19.320 --> 03:26.360]  before that with kings and queens and lords and ladies this is how power behind the throne
[03:26.360 --> 03:32.840]  always tries to take people out very very quietly so they don't become martyrs alexander
[03:32.840 --> 03:38.200]  the great was obviously poisoned many many other people were poisoned woodrow wilson
[03:38.200 --> 03:43.160]  was poison and they said he had a he had a stroke and then lived a few months after that
[03:43.160 --> 03:48.480]  but he was able to write from that point with by dictating and expose the deep state that
[03:48.480 --> 03:52.840]  had manipulated him that he then fought back against but he first called for the new world
[03:52.840 --> 03:59.160]  order so i can tell you exclusively at info wars dot com and also natural news dot com
[03:59.160 --> 04:02.280]  because mike's a great researcher and writer he helped me get this out as quickly as possible
[04:02.280 --> 04:08.640]  this morning along with kit daniels we have those exclusive reports on info wars dot com
[04:08.640 --> 04:13.640]  and natural news dot com right now exclusive president trump makes unscheduled stop at
[04:13.640 --> 04:18.080]  military hospital to undergo battery of tests for possible deliberate poisoning of food
[04:18.080 --> 04:23.400]  with time delayed chemical agent food tester gravely ill reportedly white house connected
[04:23.400 --> 04:31.120]  source says and i've made phone calls to some of the folks that have other sources in the
[04:31.120 --> 04:38.080]  white house and and the the calls came back oh absolutely they just say it's common knowledge
[04:38.080 --> 04:43.080]  there have been multiple attempts on the president's life and that we should look at the secret
[04:43.080 --> 04:49.480]  service agent that died in july of 2018 while in scotland with the president he was young
[04:49.480 --> 04:55.720]  in a great shape died on the spot from some of the cyanide like a weapon that all got
[04:55.720 --> 05:01.560]  swept under the rug very very quickly stay with us i've made a lot of predictions that
[05:01.560 --> 05:06.800]  have come true but i'm here to tell you that most of those really weren't predictions that
[05:06.800 --> 05:12.280]  came out of a crystal ball i could see where the globalists were going i could see what
[05:12.280 --> 05:17.080]  their end game agenda was what their goal was and i knew that when they were setting
[05:17.080 --> 05:22.840]  us up to be deplatformed that they were really setting the precedent to take everybody off
[05:22.840 --> 05:30.400]  air to to silence everyone to ban words and names and information on fake whistleblowers
[05:30.400 --> 05:36.040]  so that their false narratives couldn't be opposed but the globalists really feared was
[05:36.040 --> 05:42.320]  independent media and platforms in the future it was the model of info wars as much as the
[05:42.320 --> 05:47.720]  information that had to be silenced because they need total information dominance for
[05:47.720 --> 05:51.880]  their outrageous lies and the evil they're pushing to succeed and that's why keeping
[05:51.880 --> 06:15.800]  info wars on the air is now more imperative and more vital than ever
[06:15.800 --> 06:24.600]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[06:24.600 --> 06:38.200]  it's alex jones this is a world exclusive ladies and gentlemen the new york times the
[06:38.200 --> 06:45.720]  new york post cnn others are saying it's a mystery about the president saturday with
[06:45.720 --> 06:54.920]  a lot of really concerned looking secret service pulled in a train of armored suvs to the walter
[06:54.920 --> 07:03.600]  reid emergency military hospital with the president and then suddenly it was in the
[07:03.600 --> 07:10.360]  news and it was out of the news very little coverage of this well i got up this morning
[07:10.360 --> 07:15.320]  this happened saturday but it didn't break till sunday and i had a lot of people calling
[07:15.320 --> 07:21.840]  me so i made some phone calls and i called some reporters that i know i have other sources
[07:21.840 --> 07:27.880]  i'll just leave it at that and they said it's common knowledge there have been multiple
[07:27.880 --> 07:35.000]  attempts on the president from the very early days and that indeed they have been trying
[07:35.000 --> 07:39.160]  to slowly drug him at first that's what our sources said two and a half years ago we're
[07:39.160 --> 07:43.200]  going to play that club coming up and that now they've just gone right towards trying
[07:43.200 --> 07:49.080]  to debilitate him or kill the president and i can tell you that those reports we put out
[07:49.080 --> 07:54.800]  on air at the time were picked up by the secret service who said that they were told to call
[07:54.800 --> 08:02.840]  me from the president and to brief them and so i have briefed the secret service twice
[08:02.840 --> 08:08.480]  and i'll be happy if the secret service calls me today to talk to them as well obviously
[08:08.480 --> 08:13.320]  this is the left hand and the right hand knowing what's going on but pretending like they're
[08:13.320 --> 08:18.300]  not communicating this isn't something that the white house wants to put out in a big
[08:18.300 --> 08:22.480]  national announcement they just wanted to go directly to the listeners that this is
[08:22.480 --> 08:29.120]  indeed going on and is how surrounded the president is that's why he sends out trusted
[08:29.120 --> 08:35.520]  members of the secret service to get him fast food to pick it up at random restaurants to
[08:35.520 --> 08:40.800]  go to hole in the walls because the president knows that he's being targeted probably more
[08:40.800 --> 08:46.840]  than any leader in history for poisoning now yeah there it is london guardian please print
[08:46.840 --> 08:51.320]  me that donald trump he's mcdonald's for fear of being poisoned that says it all now it
[08:51.320 --> 08:59.240]  was roger stone first broke that here on air two and a half years ago now why do you think
[08:59.240 --> 09:03.200]  they wanted roger stone in prison because he was talking to the president every other
[09:03.200 --> 09:09.840]  day for sometimes an hour at a time and obviously it's not a secret now that he met secretly
[09:09.840 --> 09:15.400]  um with the president a few times and i'll just leave it at that that's the president's
[09:15.400 --> 09:22.560]  right to meet with who he wants that's when they fired up the whole fake muller report
[09:22.560 --> 09:27.360]  and probe so that the lawyers can tell trump don't talk to stone don't talk to jones don't
[09:27.360 --> 09:33.280]  talk to any of your supporters youtube of course is very aggressively run around taking
[09:33.280 --> 09:40.120]  our videos down roger stone talks trump poisoning chiller resignation and more getting rid of
[09:40.120 --> 09:46.480]  his longtime confidant so they could go after him september 13th 2017 but we have that censored
[09:46.480 --> 09:50.280]  blocked report we're gonna be hearing parts of it in the second hour it's gonna be reposted
[09:50.280 --> 09:58.160]  in minutes to info wars dot com if you just joined us the president's unannounced visit
[09:58.160 --> 10:06.600]  according to our sources was because one of his food testers ate the food but they also
[10:06.600 --> 10:16.360]  use high tech electronics and chemical testing to scan his food but he still doesn't trust
[10:16.360 --> 10:23.400]  it and normally just baits and switches them and has trusted aids go to random fast food
[10:23.400 --> 10:30.600]  places and again that's been in the news broken 2018 mainstream news we told you about it
[10:30.600 --> 10:35.160]  in 2017 because roger stone talked to the president about it and roger said are you
[10:35.160 --> 10:39.680]  being careful about poisoning and they had a long conversation about it that roger relayed
[10:39.680 --> 10:47.640]  part of back to me the rest of it was in confidence but trump believed at one point that they
[10:47.640 --> 10:52.680]  were doing something to his food and now we have secret service connections and others
[10:52.680 --> 10:57.960]  that have identified it with the test what's going on so this is super dangerous what you're
[10:57.960 --> 11:03.600]  hearing here on air we exposed fiona hill general McMaster being soros operatives we
[11:03.600 --> 11:11.760]  exposed by name here on this broadcast investigative journalist eric sierra mala do they want to
[11:11.760 --> 11:17.120]  arrest you if you say his name now that attempt to stop us is collapsed thanks to ram paul
[11:17.120 --> 11:23.760]  and others but that's how crazy all of this has gotten in how dangerous so when i get
[11:23.760 --> 11:28.560]  up here and i say hey i'm sticking my head in a lion's mouth i'm not doing it to sell
[11:28.560 --> 11:34.920]  tickets at a circus i'm doing it because somebody's got to do it but we're not up here just
[11:34.920 --> 11:44.440]  saying this i was approached by secret service at the rnc three and a half years ago in july
[11:44.440 --> 11:50.720]  in cleveland and they said yeah we hate hillary too she's terrible you know about her medical
[11:50.720 --> 11:53.920]  problems and i said well i've heard about she had a brain tumor and they said listen
[11:53.920 --> 11:59.720]  you need to put a team on her everywhere she goes and i said well i have a few routines
[11:59.720 --> 12:06.400]  they said listen you need to you need to make the teams and we're going to give you more
[12:06.400 --> 12:10.920]  info in the next month well it actually took two months and they wouldn't notice the telephone
[12:10.920 --> 12:17.600]  and they actually came to austin i'm going to leave it that and they also met with joe
[12:17.600 --> 12:23.360]  biggs because of his michael hastings reporting when they blew his car up and it didn't mean
[12:23.360 --> 12:27.320]  joe biggs or ire the coolest guys in the world just means we're willing to risk our lives
[12:27.320 --> 12:31.360]  and they said listen she's got a black ambulance she's having convulsions every 45 minutes
[12:31.360 --> 12:35.080]  because they had to take her off the drugs so she can give a speech so she's not dopey
[12:35.080 --> 12:39.080]  but then she tends to have them and she's going to have an emergency surgery and they
[12:39.080 --> 12:45.040]  wouldn't give us any more information i then had pechenek who's got all the connections
[12:45.040 --> 12:51.040]  in the cia he's to run major operations and he said yes indeed multiple brain tumor surgeries
[12:51.040 --> 12:56.320]  convulsions falling down and then she collapsed in new york city one week after milley caught
[12:56.320 --> 13:00.200]  her on tape collapsing in a tent them running in there with the stretchers and the rest
[13:00.200 --> 13:08.800]  of it so when i tell you we have these sources we have them now milley has talked to some
[13:08.800 --> 13:16.200]  of her sources and confirmed the information i had but she got even more i'm going to just
[13:16.200 --> 13:21.840]  let her go as far as she wants to go but milley broke the big tentucky election fraud information
[13:21.840 --> 13:28.920]  and she just continues to be a real newshound and so i was literally about to call her this
[13:28.920 --> 13:35.080]  morning and she started texting me about this and and so well as we speak she is on the
[13:35.080 --> 13:43.160]  phone getting more information but it is well known and there's milley right there over
[13:43.160 --> 13:47.520]  your tv viewer you see her literally following hillary and then her being taken with a bunch
[13:47.520 --> 13:52.880]  of emergency vehicles into a tent for an hour with the guy with the epi pen at her side
[13:52.880 --> 13:55.880]  before she came out and gave the speech an hour later looking like she'd been struck
[13:55.880 --> 14:03.080]  by a bolt of lightning and you saw her a week later collapse on 9 11 in new york city and
[14:03.080 --> 14:07.160]  the media would cut the point when she collapsed and say oh we just made it up they would show
[14:07.160 --> 14:12.120]  you the collapse part they said it was fake news no none of this is fake news and believe
[14:12.120 --> 14:18.320]  me i don't enjoy sticking my neck out like this but it's what has to be done so i do
[14:18.320 --> 14:21.400]  amp myself up and then at a certain point started enjoying it and sick and i've repented
[14:21.400 --> 14:27.320]  for it i prayed a lot this weekend it's not good when i get in the craze mode and i apologize
[14:27.320 --> 14:31.800]  but i'm asking god to lead god and direct me and i don't get too worldly in this thing
[14:31.800 --> 14:35.480]  because i i'll be honest i started enjoying the danger and it's sick and it's not right
[14:35.480 --> 14:40.120]  the affair for my children but the point is is that this is this is very very real ladies
[14:40.120 --> 14:43.920]  and gentlemen and the president's very very fatalistic about this is going to carry it
[14:43.920 --> 14:49.480]  out but they don't want to just shoot him like reagan turning him into a hero or a martyr
[14:49.480 --> 14:54.680]  or like kennedy they want to just slowly poison him debilitate him and say 25th amendment
[14:54.680 --> 15:04.320]  he's mentally ill and they want to give him a dose of something that makes him extremely
[15:04.320 --> 15:14.400]  sick and the word is he's so tough that scott german that they think he's been hit before
[15:14.400 --> 15:18.600]  from the test but i'm not allowed they're not allowed to even tell me the specifics they
[15:18.600 --> 15:25.200]  just gave me generalities they said it's like cyanide's one of the things and anti psychotics
[15:25.200 --> 15:28.320]  where if you're not psychotic and they put it in a little dose it just can also make
[15:28.320 --> 15:33.440]  you think you're going crazy so they wanted to do 25th amendment deal but he just bolted
[15:33.440 --> 15:38.080]  off and just plowed through it part of that drug demon's on air force one two that's what
[15:38.080 --> 15:42.840]  you see him stumbling off the plane and so now they're going to go to really bad stuff
[15:42.840 --> 15:47.960]  but looks like they missed again and the food tester got hit like the secret service agent
[15:47.960 --> 15:52.880]  that collapsed and died when he was a food tester in scotland for the president it's
[15:52.880 --> 15:56.520]  all coming up with the deep state is moving stay with us we've got exclusive straight

[18:14.960 --> 18:21.680]  resign and leave instead of facing impeachment and he's running to florida well now we know
[18:21.680 --> 18:26.440]  why the president did that he knew the leftist controlled appeals courts we're going to say
[18:26.440 --> 18:31.400]  that he had to give up his tax returns so they can pour over them and harass every business
[18:31.400 --> 18:38.680]  partner he's got they want to terrorize people that he's worked with and by moving his domicile
[18:38.680 --> 18:44.560]  from new york to florida that gets around the new york law they passed to get his tax
[18:44.560 --> 18:50.080]  returns that are supposed to be private so all those people out there holding their breath
[18:50.080 --> 18:56.480]  for the president to resign in his words we're kicking the deep states ass and he's never
[18:56.480 --> 19:03.880]  going to resign beto or orc came out dozens of times and said we're going to confiscate
[19:03.880 --> 19:08.900]  all your semi automatic rifles and he got all the other democrats on the stage nine others
[19:08.900 --> 19:14.440]  to agree and said that he was a hero think about that now those democrats have taken
[19:14.440 --> 19:20.080]  all the guns in the cities they control their blue cities are literal crap holes covered
[19:20.080 --> 19:27.160]  with needles and with massive drug dealing and incredible levels of violent crime they
[19:27.160 --> 19:32.000]  know what they're doing and now the supreme courts come out and ruled that gun manufacturers
[19:32.000 --> 19:37.000]  can be sued into oblivion for what criminals do using their firearms my goodness ladies
[19:37.000 --> 19:42.800]  and gentlemen this country's under such incredible attack but more and more towns and cities are
[19:42.800 --> 19:46.760]  saying they're sanctuaries for the second amendment and they're going to follow the original
[19:46.760 --> 19:50.840]  bill of rights and constitution and they're not going to help in the confiscation of
[19:50.840 --> 19:55.520]  guns so you see a lot of these cities ignore illegal aliens well we could ignore all your
[19:55.520 --> 20:05.720]  unconstitutional laws you're listening to the alex jones show
[20:05.720 --> 20:25.000]  we've got it waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front
[20:25.000 --> 20:33.880]  lines of the info war ladies and gentlemen i am alex jones your host on this monday november
[20:33.880 --> 20:42.240]  18th 2019 global broadcast and president trump had an unexpected rushed visit i've seen the
[20:42.240 --> 20:46.040]  footage of it at walter read we played at the start of the show of the secret service
[20:46.040 --> 20:52.720]  in to do a battery of test now they've tried to spin it that well he just did his his annual
[20:52.720 --> 21:01.680]  exam a little early well we're told that folks in the white house are concerned that they
[21:01.680 --> 21:07.120]  may have tried to poison him they were doing the test to see if indeed he did have any
[21:07.120 --> 21:11.720]  of this in his body and that reportedly in an individual that did come down as sick they
[21:11.720 --> 21:18.320]  found a byproduct of particular type of slow acting poison by slow acting it doesn't hit
[21:18.320 --> 21:23.720]  you right away so that way then the food gets cleaned up it gets thrown away and then a day
[21:23.720 --> 21:30.920]  later or so you you you start getting really ill and then it's hard to track it now again
[21:30.920 --> 21:35.320]  you don't want to assassinate somebody like trump it turns him into a martyr so the way
[21:35.320 --> 21:40.200]  you take out a king or an emperor or president that you don't like is either slowly poisoning
[21:40.200 --> 21:47.800]  them to debilitate them or you drug them with chemicals that will make them act loopy so
[21:47.800 --> 21:54.280]  you can remove them via the 25th amendment which we told you on September 11th 2017
[21:54.280 --> 21:58.640]  that's when the broadcast was we're gonna air that next hour part of it rogers children
[21:58.640 --> 22:05.040]  I that indeed White House sources believe that chemicals to debilitate the president
[22:05.040 --> 22:08.760]  were being put into his food and I can tell you the president we told you at the time
[22:08.760 --> 22:13.200]  was also concerned that was later confirmed by the New York Times and the London Guardian
[22:13.200 --> 22:20.920]  the next year in January of 2018 a few months later I guess three four months later that
[22:20.920 --> 22:25.840]  indeed the president did get fast food and did send out AIDS he trusted to do this and
[22:25.840 --> 22:33.640]  the Secret Service and you have the Attorney General on Friday giving a speech saying that
[22:33.640 --> 22:38.480]  there is a civil war with the deep state trying to overthrow the executive branch and the election
[22:38.480 --> 22:42.080]  and that we're in a war I'm gonna play that clip next segment and then Bill Maher goes
[22:42.080 --> 22:51.080]  on HBO and says we don't want a civil war I guess so when the president Obama gave
[22:51.080 --> 22:55.200]  a similar speech the same day oh that way if something happened bad to Trump a few days
[22:55.200 --> 22:59.840]  later because the poison had already been delivered oh see they were calling for peace
[22:59.840 --> 23:07.400]  and reconciliation even before the president would have a stroke and die or be debilitated
[23:07.400 --> 23:12.280]  magically right on time this is the way this works throughout history in fact most King's
[23:12.280 --> 23:17.120]  courts had poisoning most monarchs never lived out their lives they would end up being poisoned
[23:17.120 --> 23:21.920]  to death but then rarely would it be exposed that had happened till later they've tested
[23:21.920 --> 23:27.560]  the bodies of monarchs buried in famous tombs in London and in Paris and they have poisons
[23:27.560 --> 23:37.200]  in them they died of poisons and you've got the CIA the rogue state saying thank God for
[23:37.200 --> 23:42.040]  the deep state we're gonna overthrow the president just two weeks ago on C-span you've got CIA
[23:42.040 --> 23:46.040]  Ramallah, Sierra Ramallah in there and the fake whistleblower and they're getting their
[23:46.040 --> 23:49.680]  asses kicked in the deep state so what are they gonna do Trump said last week we're kicking
[23:49.680 --> 23:56.360]  their ass they're like that's it we'll show him and we're told by our sources look into
[23:56.360 --> 24:00.880]  this July 18th of last year secret service agent dies at the suffering stroke on the
[24:00.880 --> 24:13.040]  job with Trump 42 year old in great shape special agent Noel E. Remigin was working
[24:13.040 --> 24:17.720]  on a protection for national security advisor John Bolton on the midnight shift when he
[24:17.720 --> 24:23.680]  was found to be unresponsive by colleagues at Trump's Turnberry resort he died of a stroke
[24:23.680 --> 24:30.080]  we're told let's go to Millie Weaver with the balance of the hour Millie I know you've
[24:30.080 --> 24:34.120]  been working this very closely we were both working on the same time I was literally about
[24:34.120 --> 24:38.920]  to call you cut my workout short this morning because this was so important I was 10 minutes
[24:38.920 --> 24:44.120]  into it and I was about to call you I just told my personal trainer I was working out
[24:44.120 --> 24:49.080]  with I was warming up I'm gonna have to cut this off and just work out the next four days
[24:49.080 --> 24:54.760]  because I gotta get on this I gotta call Millie Weaver and obviously just like Mike Cernovich
[24:54.760 --> 24:59.040]  has had wide out sources that are excellent you've got some great sources we've had sources
[24:59.040 --> 25:03.480]  those have been basically cut off except through our intermediaries my intermediaries have
[25:03.480 --> 25:07.880]  confirmed exactly the information you revealed to me without me even telling you what I've
[25:07.880 --> 25:12.840]  been told you've told me via text that since then that was an hour or two ago that we've
[25:12.840 --> 25:20.400]  last talked that you've learned more so run through exactly what we know is going on and
[25:20.400 --> 25:26.400]  the revelation that it's well known there's been attempts and that that's why he sends
[25:26.400 --> 25:29.880]  people out to get his food it won't eat the food in the White House so this is incredible
[25:29.880 --> 25:33.960]  Millie and it fits into the whole climate we're seeing of kill the president remove the president
[25:33.960 --> 25:38.760]  attack his supporters go to their houses the New York Times calling for his assassination
[25:38.760 --> 25:43.560]  plays in Central Park calling for him to be killed like Caesar it's it's I mean they're
[25:43.560 --> 25:49.520]  failing on every front next is the false flag to demonize the president and or assassination
[25:49.520 --> 25:54.560]  Millie Weaver there have been many attempts to take out President Trump you just don't
[25:54.560 --> 25:58.640]  hear about it that much in the mainstream media because there's always cover stories
[25:58.640 --> 26:04.320]  now what we know is that President Trump went to the hospital yesterday or not so Saturday
[26:04.320 --> 26:11.040]  he went to the hospital and that's not typical to go to the hospital unannounced unscheduled
[26:11.040 --> 26:16.080]  for the president and they're using the story that it was for an annual exam he's just doing
[26:16.080 --> 26:21.240]  it early well we know that the annual exams are once a year and it has been nine months
[26:21.240 --> 26:26.760]  since his last annual exam so it's a cover story it's very clear then my sources reached
[26:26.760 --> 26:32.040]  out and basically gave me the behind the scenes story there was a food tester Secret Service
[26:32.040 --> 26:37.920]  food tester that got ill after testing and eating the food but whatever it was it must
[26:37.920 --> 26:42.920]  have been a slow acting chemical because it didn't like immediately react chemically
[26:42.920 --> 26:50.440]  in the blood system so that allowed Trump to also consume the food as well and so because
[26:50.440 --> 26:56.440]  the Secret Service food tester ended up going to the hospital and hospital saying that his
[26:56.440 --> 27:02.400]  illness was caused by ingestion the safe thing to do was then to have the president go to
[27:02.400 --> 27:08.960]  the hospital as well to run exams to see if he also had ingested this chemical the president
[27:08.960 --> 27:15.160]  has food testers and they also test his food for chemicals but whatever this chemical was
[27:15.160 --> 27:21.120]  it was not the typical chemicals that they would test for like cyanide arsenic and that
[27:21.120 --> 27:26.240]  type of thing whatever it was it was something that would slow act in the blood and then
[27:26.240 --> 27:32.120]  later on when you would test you would see it having accumulated in the blood so that's
[27:32.120 --> 27:35.800]  what we're hearing right now but there have been other attempts on the president's life
[27:35.800 --> 27:41.280]  as well we hear the behind the scenes scoop that this Secret Service agent in Scotland
[27:41.280 --> 27:47.440]  was actually a food tester as well that suddenly dropped dead and had a stroke well apparently
[27:47.440 --> 27:53.240]  the Secret Service agent was very physically fit he was someone who you know took very
[27:53.240 --> 27:58.760]  good care of themselves and just randomly drops dead in Scotland when we know how much
[27:58.760 --> 28:05.160]  the UK and the people in power there the government the royal family there hated Trump so of course
[28:05.160 --> 28:09.200]  there's going to be attempts on President Trump's life we've seen attempt after attempt
[28:09.200 --> 28:16.120]  to remove him to have a coup to remove him from his office so why would they not try
[28:16.120 --> 28:22.840]  to go about poisoning him even if it's a slow acting poison to get rid of him because they
[28:22.840 --> 28:28.040]  know they have nothing in 2020 the president is very healthy he's got stamina he can hold
[28:28.040 --> 28:32.800]  these massive rallies where tens of thousands of Americans turn out and he can do these
[28:32.800 --> 28:38.800]  rallies time after time after time days in a row and they know he's completely surrounded
[28:38.800 --> 28:44.320]  by CIA operatives in deep state that said they would faithfully execute their jobs and have
[28:44.320 --> 28:47.800]  traitorously like Benedict Arnold not done that let's talk about more about what your
[28:47.800 --> 28:52.880]  sources and my sources have said about how the president is completely surrounded inside

[30:59.640 --> 31:06.840]  know that I will never willingly give up. I've said it many times, I will never give in. I will
[31:06.840 --> 31:13.640]  never give up, but I could give out. And it's very, very frustrating to see them committing all their
[31:13.640 --> 31:20.920]  crimes against humanity, to see evil running rampant like this and to know that most Americans
[31:20.920 --> 31:26.440]  have already been silenced in cyberspace. That most Americans have already been shadow banned
[31:26.440 --> 31:33.240]  by big tech. And to know that most Americans feel powerless and don't realize how much power they
[31:33.240 --> 31:40.760]  have by spreading the word about newswords.com, infowords.com and band.video. And that people
[31:40.760 --> 31:45.640]  are hungry for the truth now more than ever. And then if you tell people, hey, the banned truth
[31:45.640 --> 31:52.040]  they don't want you to have is at infowords.com forward slash show and band.video. So take heart,
[31:52.040 --> 31:56.120]  folks. They've had to censor everybody to shut everybody down because the truth is powerful
[31:56.120 --> 32:02.920]  and they can't beat us fair and square. Infowars life has done it again with undoubtedly our biggest

[32:17.720 --> 32:23.080]  It's called whitening toothpaste, but really it knocks out the bacteria. It recalcifies the teeth.
[32:23.080 --> 32:29.800]  It does so many things on so many fronts. These beautiful tubes of super silver toothpaste
[32:29.800 --> 32:34.920]  are available at an introductory price of 25% off out of the gates. It's as low as we can go.

[32:40.680 --> 32:46.520]  a hit. I'm very, very proud of it. I want to thank my father, a retired dentist for spearheading this
[32:46.520 --> 32:51.560]  the last two years and developing it. It's 25% off out of the gates. That's as low as we can go
[32:51.560 --> 33:11.560]  because it's very, very expensive to produce. Get yours today at infowarslife.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:22.280 --> 33:31.160]  I'm Alex Jones, your host. And these are incredibly dangerous strange times.
[33:32.920 --> 33:36.520]  Two plus years ago, I didn't want to say that General McMaster and Fiona Hill were
[33:36.520 --> 33:41.320]  soros operatives. You can look it up and see they were. I didn't want to have Mike Cernovich on and
[33:41.320 --> 33:46.600]  expose that Eric Ciramella was CIA trying to overthrow the president. Now it's all confirmed.
[33:46.600 --> 33:52.280]  But those are real reporters. I mean, Mike Cernovich really got me secret Google documents of their
[33:52.280 --> 33:57.720]  planned platform me six months before it happened paying firms millions of dollars
[33:57.720 --> 34:02.600]  to go out and post fake news in my name so they'd have the excuse to do it.
[34:04.120 --> 34:08.520]  That was all true. And I'm not trying to write myself into this story. I'm trying to explain to you
[34:08.520 --> 34:21.320]  that we really break real news. That's why they want us off the year. Everybody else knows about all this
[34:22.600 --> 34:29.960]  in the media. They're just scared to report it. I'm just dumb enough. I guess the establishment
[34:29.960 --> 34:35.560]  thinks to stand up against them. No, I'm not dumb enough to keep going along with corruption
[34:35.560 --> 34:40.520]  like everybody else does. And I want everybody to pull back and look at the place correct.
[34:41.160 --> 34:47.320]  Fake impeachments. Fake Russiagate. All these innocent people sent to prison.
[34:47.320 --> 34:48.840]  None of it for connection to Russians.
[34:52.040 --> 34:57.320]  Massive censorship now against tens of millions of nationalist Christians and conservatives.
[34:57.320 --> 35:05.160]  Neocons moving in again and calling for censorship of Trump's original base ahead of them making a
[35:05.160 --> 35:18.360]  move on him. And now you've got the Attorney General Barr giving a speech in D.C. Friday,
[35:18.360 --> 35:28.840]  stories up on info wars.com saying that the left is trying to overthrow the executive and the election.
[35:28.840 --> 35:33.800]  Well, yes, and that's a coup and that's illegal. And so Trump and the Justice Department's inaction
[35:33.800 --> 35:40.680]  as what has emboldened them to exponentially ratchet things up. The growth curve started
[35:40.680 --> 35:45.400]  slow and now it's going straight up. The attempts to steal the election. The attempts to not let
[35:45.400 --> 35:53.880]  the delegates seat themselves. For the inauguration. The illegal investigations. Congressional hearings
[35:53.880 --> 35:59.400]  saying I'm a Russian agent. The CIA taking its gloves off and trying to crush info wars.
[36:00.040 --> 36:05.560]  And all the dirty tricks they ran. And the New York Times and Buzzfeed in camp in Austin
[36:05.560 --> 36:09.560]  trying to pay people money to lie about me. That's just what I've experienced.
[36:09.560 --> 36:16.360]  And then we learned from info wars two and a half years ago that all these people in the White House
[36:16.360 --> 36:19.640]  are keeping info wars from the president. They're keeping information from the president. They're
[36:19.640 --> 36:25.000]  trying to suppress the president. They're trying to remove the president. They're trying to undermine
[36:25.000 --> 36:33.400]  the president. And here we are three plus years out 350 days from the election. And I care about
[36:33.400 --> 36:37.160]  the president. I'm glad it's not Hillary in there and I hope they don't kill him. I hope they don't
[36:37.160 --> 36:44.280]  assassinate him because if they do all hell is going to break loose even worse. And this country
[36:44.280 --> 36:50.760]  is going to be totally destabilized. But if they are able to poison him and just say he died of
[36:50.760 --> 36:56.360]  natural causes or had a stroke or was incapacitated then they can just make it a big conspiracy
[36:56.360 --> 37:03.800]  theory. And then it just kind of fades out just like Jeffrey Epstein. But I would caution the
[37:03.800 --> 37:09.480]  establishment not to do this. It's insane. It's dangerous. It's out of control all because somebody
[37:09.480 --> 37:15.640]  got elected who wants to be president and who actually cares about the nation. I'll go back
[37:15.640 --> 37:19.480]  to Millie Weaver here in a moment with her breaking news and information. But if you just joined us
[37:19.480 --> 37:23.720]  these stories need to go viral from info wars dot com and we're adding up a bit of information to
[37:23.720 --> 37:28.520]  them as we speak and the live feed of the show is there. White House source Trump made unexpected
[37:28.520 --> 37:33.960]  the hospital visit the test for intentional poisoning. We've added the word intentional who
[37:33.960 --> 37:40.120]  tested was first rushed the hospital and doctors believe there was exposure to time delayed poison.
[37:41.800 --> 37:46.040]  Mike Adams has done an excellent job writing report about it as well that we have linked
[37:46.040 --> 37:57.800]  in the article as well. But since I mentioned this let's go ahead and play a clip of the
[37:58.600 --> 38:04.920]  attorney general talking about the mutiny the coup by rogue elements of the government against
[38:04.920 --> 38:08.760]  an entire branch of the government. If you tried to go in and you worked in a federal court and
[38:08.760 --> 38:13.880]  you tried to throw documents away from the judge and throw signed orders away you'd be arrested
[38:13.880 --> 38:20.440]  for fraud racketeering criminal activity. But they admit what we told you two years ago they get
[38:20.440 --> 38:25.960]  his executive orders and throw them away and hide things from him and to save us they say because
[38:25.960 --> 38:31.000]  they're really the deep state thank God for the deep state as Britain was at an event saying two
[38:31.000 --> 38:37.160]  weeks ago. The intelligence community is going to take this guy out former CIA director McLaughlin
[38:37.160 --> 38:46.200]  said right next to him that's illegal. So of course he's under siege of course he's having to
[38:46.200 --> 38:50.520]  have his food chemically and electronically and then biologically tested by a human
[38:52.600 --> 38:54.920]  and boy that is a dangerous job let me tell you.
[38:57.960 --> 39:02.920]  He is surrounded by criminals and they believe they're going to win and they've tried over and
[39:02.920 --> 39:08.280]  over again like degenerate gamblers and they keep doubling down hoping they're finally going to
[39:08.280 --> 39:14.600]  get him. And then Trump and the Justice Department don't move against him which makes them I don't
[39:14.600 --> 39:18.760]  even use the word incompetent but they're aiding and abetting in their own destruction by lack of
[39:18.760 --> 39:24.440]  action. But it's because Trump is surrounded by a pack of social climbing cowards. This country
[39:24.440 --> 39:29.960]  is in a deep crisis so yes ladies and gentlemen of course they're trying to poison him of course
[39:29.960 --> 39:33.800]  they're trying to drug him we'll get to that with Millie in a moment but here is the Attorney General
[39:33.800 --> 39:41.240]  on Friday. Unfortunately just in the past few years we have seen these conflicts
[39:41.880 --> 39:48.760]  take on an entirely new character. Immediately after President Trump won election opponents
[39:48.760 --> 39:57.400]  inaugurated what they called the resistance and they rallied around an explicit strategy of using
[39:57.400 --> 40:05.800]  every tool and maneuver to sabotage the functioning of the executive branch and his administration.
[40:05.800 --> 40:10.040]  Hey pause back that up started over at the beginning we'll come back to Millie next time
[40:10.040 --> 40:13.160]  she'll be with us in the next hour and we'll open the phones up so just co-host with me.
[40:14.520 --> 40:18.440]  Let's get a journalist she's awesome I just can't help but admire her and the rest of crew just
[40:18.440 --> 40:24.840]  look at these folks here. In fact we're here doing this did you hear him they've used every tool
[40:24.840 --> 40:32.920]  every tool to sabotage the executive branch violence threats impeachment fake reports
[40:32.920 --> 40:41.000]  disinfo economic sabotage and then what else poisoning every tool is every tool you just heard
[40:41.880 --> 40:46.600]  the Attorney General confirm every tool he's very careful about what he says in these words
[40:46.600 --> 40:53.000]  start over from the beginning listen to this he calls not liberals but leftist that's a big
[40:53.000 --> 40:59.640]  difference here it is unfortunately just in the past few years we have seen this these conflicts
[41:00.200 --> 41:07.160]  take on an entirely new character immediately after President Trump won election opponents
[41:07.160 --> 41:15.720]  inaugurated what they called the resistance and they rallied around an explicit strategy of using
[41:15.720 --> 41:24.360]  every tool and maneuver to sabotage the functioning of the executive branch and his administration
[41:25.080 --> 41:32.760]  the fact of the matter is that in waging a scorched earth no holds barred war of resistance
[41:33.560 --> 41:41.080]  against this administration it is the left that is engaged in the systematic shredding of norms
[41:41.080 --> 41:47.480]  and undermining the rule of law and what did Louis Gohmert say a few weeks ago he said we're
[41:47.480 --> 41:51.160]  moving into a shooting war they're starting it they already tried to kill 18 members of the
[41:51.160 --> 41:56.760]  conservative caucus thank god security took the guy out only scolese and what one security person
[41:56.760 --> 42:01.640]  got shot other than the scumbag then they broke Rand Paul's ribs and they went to Mitch McConnell's
[42:01.640 --> 42:05.080]  house and said we're going to kill you and twitter agreed with it and blocked Mitch McConnell's
[42:05.080 --> 42:10.200]  complaint then they ran Tucker Carlson out of dc coming and knocking his door down and
[42:10.200 --> 42:15.240]  bunch of other stuff that went on that's not going to get into because it's private but believe me
[42:15.240 --> 42:22.440]  folks they have been assessing targets preparing for violence dreaming of what they'll do they've
[42:22.440 --> 42:26.360]  got their operatives in the White House can you imagine what it's like to be the president god
[42:26.360 --> 42:32.920]  blessing but i'm just mad at the whole situation we're gonna come back to Milley on more of what
[42:32.920 --> 42:36.840]  they have been getting into his food not on the poisoning side but on the drugging side
[42:36.840 --> 42:41.400]  her sources say oh yeah we're gonna give you exclusive info from her sources i've got my sources
[42:41.400 --> 42:46.440]  that are saying the exact same thing before i talk to her and we'll show you clips of us two years
[42:46.440 --> 42:52.840]  ago laying all this out first info wars dot com news wars dot com please share these articles
[42:52.840 --> 43:00.360]  and the live links to the show history is happening now i've made a lot of predictions
[43:00.360 --> 43:06.040]  that have come true but i'm here to tell you that most of those really weren't predictions that came
[43:06.040 --> 43:12.040]  out of a crystal ball i could see where the globalists were going i could see what their in-game
[43:12.040 --> 43:17.720]  agenda was what their goal was and i knew that when they were setting us up to be de-platformed
[43:17.720 --> 43:24.200]  that they were really setting the precedent to take everybody off air to to silence everyone to ban
[43:25.000 --> 43:31.480]  words and names and information on fake whistleblowers so that their false narratives couldn't
[43:31.480 --> 43:38.520]  be opposed but the globalists really feared was independent media and platforms in the future
[43:38.520 --> 43:44.680]  it was the model of info wars as much as the information that had to be silenced because
[43:44.680 --> 43:49.400]  they need total information dominance for their outrageous lies and the evil they're pushing
[43:49.400 --> 43:55.240]  to succeed that's why keeping info wars on the air is now more imperative and more vital than ever
[43:55.240 --> 44:05.960]  a question was once posed to thomas depperson what is the level of tyranny
[44:07.240 --> 44:13.400]  that a tyrant will take humanity to how far will they go what's their limit and he said it is the
[44:13.400 --> 44:23.320]  limit to which other men and women will submit the answer is there is no limit to evil it is a
[44:23.320 --> 44:30.040]  bottomless pit we've been taught in modern culture and society that evil doesn't exist
[44:30.920 --> 44:36.040]  or that there's no free will there's no devil or the god but those very same people have all
[44:36.040 --> 44:43.240]  these rules for us about speech and how we can dress and where we can live and what our houses
[44:43.240 --> 44:49.640]  can be like they just don't want us to have any values so they can run over us oxford's band
[44:49.640 --> 44:55.560]  clapping universities the us of band 21 gun salutes for veterans these people are dangerous cult
[44:55.560 --> 45:03.560]  leaders and it's time to reject them beto roark came out dozens of times and said we're going
[45:03.560 --> 45:08.600]  to confiscate all your semi-automatic rifles and he got all the other democrats on the stage
[45:08.600 --> 45:14.760]  nine others to agree and said that he was a hero think about that now those democrats have taken
[45:14.760 --> 45:21.800]  all the guns in the cities they control their blue cities are literal crap holes covered with needles
[45:21.800 --> 45:27.800]  and with massive drug dealing and incredible levels of violent crime they know what they're doing
[45:28.440 --> 45:33.800]  and now the supreme courts come out and ruled that gun manufacturers can be sued into oblivion
[45:33.800 --> 45:38.600]  for what criminals do using their firearms my goodness ladies and gentlemen this country's
[45:38.600 --> 45:44.440]  under such incredible attack but more and more towns and cities are saying they're sanctuaries
[45:44.440 --> 45:48.920]  for the second amendment and they're going to follow the original bill of rights and constitution
[45:48.920 --> 45:53.640]  and they're not going to help in the confiscation of guns so you see a lot of these cities ignore
[45:53.640 --> 46:01.000]  illegal aliens well we could ignore all your unconstitutional laws there's a famous quote by
[46:01.000 --> 46:07.560]  marine court general in the korean war when three million chai comms had flooded across the border
[46:07.560 --> 46:15.240]  and surrounded the marines more than 50 to 1 some estimates have it but the point is they were
[46:15.240 --> 46:21.160]  outnumbered and the general was told general were completely surrounded he said good we can attack
[46:21.160 --> 46:28.920]  in all directions well that's the point that info wars has reached and it really is epic it really
[46:28.920 --> 46:34.520]  is biblical and we wouldn't have gone this far without all your support but it's going to become
[46:34.520 --> 46:41.720]  more critical than ever as the censorship becomes complete and it's not just americans but folks
[46:41.720 --> 46:46.920]  all over the world are completely silenced when it comes to speak in the name of a cia fake whistle
[46:46.920 --> 46:53.800]  blower or exposing a pedophile or speaking out against dangerous vaccines because by info wars
[46:53.800 --> 47:04.120]  having its own platform that checkmates the globalist you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:04.120 --> 47:21.960]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones
[47:27.400 --> 47:33.720]  it's the global exclusive at info wars dot com news wars dot com like adams also worked with us
[47:33.720 --> 47:43.560]  put out another great article at natural news dot com white house sources said the president went to
[47:43.560 --> 47:49.720]  the hospital for a quote battery of tests as they're admitting because someone who was the food
[47:49.720 --> 47:56.200]  tester got very very sick and i know milley has sources i'm just going to leave it at that
[47:57.080 --> 48:00.280]  because they obviously try to always hunt those down and stop those it's been a big
[48:00.280 --> 48:06.360]  national story you've noticed the last three plus years but i have other sources as well i'll just
[48:06.360 --> 48:13.000]  leave it at that but i had to talk to some of those sources through lawyers and through other people
[48:13.000 --> 48:17.160]  but i can tell you the president is concerned about being poisoned it's been in the news that he
[48:17.160 --> 48:21.720]  has food testers it's been in the news he doesn't trust the food and goes against fast food roger
[48:21.720 --> 48:29.160]  stone broke that here in a whole hour long interview so it's 45 minutes long it's being
[48:29.160 --> 48:35.160]  reposted to info wars dot com because that was pre-ban so we only had archives the full show
[48:35.160 --> 48:40.680]  archive not all the clips but we're getting that it's going to be posted next hour in the articles
[48:40.680 --> 48:45.240]  from mike adams and kit daniels on info wars dot com so you get the backstory on this we'll go back

[51:05.480 --> 51:10.840]  war of an of insanity of them trying to removing this is the logical extension we know he gets
[51:10.840 --> 51:15.160]  food from outside he doesn't trust what's being done we know he's surrounded by enemies and now
[51:15.160 --> 51:20.920]  you're giving us this incredible info i'm getting it from separate people in the white house that
[51:20.920 --> 51:25.480]  are still there there's still a lot of good folks there and they say yes alex it's well known yes
[51:25.480 --> 51:30.120]  but we don't want to scare people well then why are you telling us well we want your audience to know
[51:30.120 --> 51:33.480]  because we understand that they're dialed and understand what's happening but that's how
[51:33.480 --> 51:37.800]  much pressure the president's under give us the data dump i know you have a lot more but there's
[51:37.800 --> 51:42.360]  certain things you can't say because it'll give away the sources what happened at the hospital
[51:43.080 --> 51:46.520]  at the at the medical facility but just just just run through everything you know
[51:46.520 --> 51:51.560]  from your sources millie and then the big enchilada this is the attempt to actually poisoning knocking
[51:51.560 --> 51:58.600]  out or killing before it is covert drugging that he's been dodging most of the time well first of
[51:58.600 --> 52:03.800]  all i want to start out by saying notice the media right now they're using the story that
[52:03.800 --> 52:09.720]  trump unannounced and unexpectedly went to the hospital to try to stir up talk and concerns
[52:09.720 --> 52:15.240]  about the president's health because they know that that could hurt him throughout the campaigning
[52:15.240 --> 52:21.160]  season we all know that presidential health is a big issue and people will decide to not vote for
[52:21.160 --> 52:26.520]  someone if they think that their health is unfit so that's interesting in itself right there but
[52:27.080 --> 52:33.320]  i find it interesting that they said okay it's part one of a physical health examination that's
[52:33.320 --> 52:39.000]  why the president went to the hospital who does a physical in two parts that's that doesn't happen
[52:39.000 --> 52:45.880]  people don't do that um and first of all it's an annual physical it he he already has had a physical
[52:45.880 --> 52:50.520]  nine months obviously he was rushed to hospital saturday it didn't break till sunday then they
[52:50.520 --> 52:55.080]  then now they've tried to cover it up other than saying oh it shows 25th amendment run you told me
[52:55.080 --> 52:58.920]  a lot of stuff a lot of it i was told by the other source but yes run through all the stuff you broke
[52:58.920 --> 53:06.280]  down okay okay so apparently this was some kind of a chemical a slow acting chemical that isn't
[53:06.280 --> 53:11.400]  immediately uh detected in the blood and can't immediately be tested with the test that they
[53:11.400 --> 53:16.440]  had been using and the big significance here is that they're gonna have to up dianne on the test
[53:16.440 --> 53:22.200]  that they run on his food before he eats it so that's a big deal right there um the main thing is
[53:22.200 --> 53:27.560]  that the person who tested the food they didn't notice the reactions obviously until a little bit
[53:27.560 --> 53:32.920]  later and then that's when they went to the hospital and apparently the diagnosis was that
[53:33.640 --> 53:38.920]  that something along the lines of ingestion related illness and that's what prompted the
[53:38.920 --> 53:43.800]  president to then go down there as well and i believe that they're probably this is my guess
[53:43.800 --> 53:49.160]  of it if this is a they're saying routine examination that they're probably doing a blood work up on
[53:49.160 --> 53:54.600]  the president to make sure that whatever they found in the tester they also try to see if
[53:54.600 --> 53:58.600]  that's what's in the president if they need to try to detox that or what they need to do about that
[53:58.600 --> 54:04.360]  but the president is in danger could you imagine waking up alex every morning and looking at the
[54:04.360 --> 54:09.720]  glass of water by the side of your bed and wondering is it safe to drink that am i gonna die is that
[54:09.720 --> 54:14.600]  gonna be well that's what happens to kings queens emperors i mean this is well known in history
[54:14.600 --> 54:20.680]  again they couldn't get alexander the great um in uh combat so they ended up poisoning him uh and
[54:20.680 --> 54:25.720]  then he was paralyzed so i mean this is known this is how the cowards do it and they've said
[54:25.720 --> 54:30.440]  they want to kill him and they've said they want 25th amendment uh and so obviously that's how
[54:30.440 --> 54:35.720]  they're gonna do it so he doesn't turn into a martyr millie there have been multiple attempts
[54:35.720 --> 54:40.680]  on the president and you don't hear about him like i said uh there was an instance with with
[54:40.680 --> 54:45.480]  a plane flight i mean i'm not going to get into that right now there is this instance with this
[54:45.480 --> 54:50.520]  this other secret service agent in scotland that just drops dead apparently he was a food

[1:01:12.360 --> 1:01:18.200]  ours and millie it was one of their big thing you told me about off air i'll talk more about this
[1:01:18.200 --> 1:01:25.560]  i'll talk more about this coming up next segment with mike adams and you but when roger stone was
[1:01:25.560 --> 1:01:31.240]  on on september 11 2017 the president only been in office uh eight and a half months
[1:01:32.760 --> 1:01:36.040]  stone was talking to him almost daily then and had met with him obviously and
[1:01:39.320 --> 1:01:43.720]  the president himself was concerned about being poisoned and about things making him sluggish and
[1:01:43.720 --> 1:01:48.360]  sometimes he'd be slurring his words even though he doesn't drink and the word was they thought
[1:01:48.360 --> 1:01:55.240]  something was being added to his diet coke um that had just come from me and the president
[1:01:55.240 --> 1:01:58.920]  is concerned about that well later it came out that indeed that was accurate of course it was
[1:01:59.880 --> 1:02:03.400]  it's totally normal to be concerned like this but your sources
[1:02:05.320 --> 1:02:08.280]  well i mean repeats me what you said this morning without giving away any sources
[1:02:08.280 --> 1:02:14.200]  okay well you were just saying that you know roger stone your sources were saying that uh
[1:02:14.200 --> 1:02:21.320]  the president was being slowly poisoned with something like coke um and i thought yeah i
[1:02:21.320 --> 1:02:26.200]  thought you meant cocaine and then i came back at you oh no actually my sources are saying that
[1:02:26.200 --> 1:02:33.000]  it was small um small doses of anti psychotics because if you're actually somebody who's not
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:38.440]  psychotic and you get dosed anti psychotics it can make you loopy it can make you kind of lose
[1:02:38.440 --> 1:02:43.800]  your mind or feel like you're losing your mind yeah like forcing yeah so so they were micro dosing him
[1:02:43.800 --> 1:02:50.600]  with anti psychotic that's what they were doing i'm not sure the specific drug i can't remember
[1:02:50.600 --> 1:02:56.120]  the name off the top of my head but i know that it was anti psychotic well please get back on the
[1:02:56.120 --> 1:03:00.120]  on the internet with those folks and talk to them um because i mean i know you were saying that they
[1:03:00.120 --> 1:03:03.960]  said don't say too much about what they said about the medical visit because it would give away
[1:03:03.960 --> 1:03:08.120]  what was happening there with the doctors but i mean obviously it's well known by people around
[1:03:08.120 --> 1:03:14.120]  the president there are attempts to poison him uh what specifically did they say about this this
[1:03:14.120 --> 1:03:19.480]  supposed pathogen that is detectable right away but then builds up what were the exact words you
[1:03:19.480 --> 1:03:25.960]  know i was asking i was like is it viral no was it something bacterial no it was definitely some
[1:03:25.960 --> 1:03:30.840]  kind of a chemical so we know that it's definitely a chemical but i'm like trying to understand okay
[1:03:30.840 --> 1:03:36.040]  so how is this a chemical uh what kind of chemical wouldn't they have tested it is it something they
[1:03:36.040 --> 1:03:41.320]  didn't test for initially when they run their tests on the food um and they said oh it is something
[1:03:41.320 --> 1:03:47.240]  that they don't typically test for um of course they're gonna use exotic weapons exactly it's
[1:03:47.240 --> 1:03:52.440]  something new it's some kind of new exotic just like that you set out because it's something new
[1:03:52.440 --> 1:03:56.840]  that they haven't dealt with before and wait is that the words they is that the word they
[1:03:56.840 --> 1:04:02.840]  used exotic or they said new they said it was something new that that something that something
[1:04:02.840 --> 1:04:08.040]  someone concocted or created that created it was something new yeah it was something new that they
[1:04:08.040 --> 1:04:14.280]  haven't they didn't look to test for does that make sense no i totally understand they can run tests
[1:04:14.280 --> 1:04:19.320]  for arsenic for cyanide other things no i understand they're using exotic things and
[1:04:19.320 --> 1:04:24.120]  what you were saying from my sources they're worried about binary weapons that's where you put
[1:04:24.120 --> 1:04:28.520]  one thing in somebody that isn't a poison one day and isn't picked up you put something else in but
[1:04:28.520 --> 1:04:34.040]  together when that once they build up those two things or three things or five things they then
[1:04:34.040 --> 1:04:42.440]  combine especially if you are drinking diet coke see all i was told was diet coke follow the diet
[1:04:42.440 --> 1:04:46.760]  coke which itself is toxic the aspartame but it can do things when it breaks down to wood alcohol
[1:04:46.760 --> 1:04:51.240]  at 87 degrees that combines with other chemicals that can create a binary weapon and later i was
[1:04:51.240 --> 1:04:55.080]  told you know basically alex it is the diet coke and what do you mean well there you go
[1:04:56.280 --> 1:05:02.600]  info wars presents the alex joneshow you supporting the broadcast over the years is why

[1:05:55.960 --> 1:06:07.640]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[1:06:11.640 --> 1:06:15.800]  new questions this morning about president trump's health after he made a sudden
[1:06:15.800 --> 1:06:21.480]  unannounced unscheduled visit to walter read medical center over the weekend now the white
[1:06:21.480 --> 1:06:26.680]  house says it was regular testing as part of his annual physical but a source tells cnn the visit
[1:06:26.680 --> 1:06:32.360]  did not follow the usual protocol for a routine presidential exam cnn his chief medical correspondent
[1:06:32.360 --> 1:06:37.880]  dr sanjay gupa is live with us so sanjay what do you see here well i mean you know the the fact
[1:06:37.880 --> 1:06:44.120]  that it did not fit protocol follow protocol uh not only from previous administrations but from
[1:06:44.120 --> 1:06:49.240]  this administration in the past the white house did alert people uh that the president was going
[1:06:49.240 --> 1:06:53.880]  to have a physical exam it was planned as you might imagine it's a it's a big deal for the
[1:06:53.880 --> 1:06:58.520]  president to show up at the hospital doesn't sound like everyone at the hospital knew about this
[1:06:58.520 --> 1:07:04.600]  so there were several protocols that were were broken here also this idea that that he went in
[1:07:04.600 --> 1:07:11.160]  for the first phase of a physical exam that's typically very typically not how it's done in
[1:07:11.160 --> 1:07:16.920]  fact many of the things that they said he had done at walter read a physical exam basic lab work
[1:07:16.920 --> 1:07:22.520]  i think was was the uh the quote that can be done at the white house as well so it does sort of
[1:07:22.520 --> 1:07:28.200]  raise this question what was necessary at walter read that couldn't be done at the white house why
[1:07:28.200 --> 1:07:34.520]  was it being done a few months early uh stephanie grisham who's the president's spokesperson has
[1:07:34.520 --> 1:07:39.880]  said very clearly look this wasn't due to any new symptoms the president was having all right
[1:07:39.880 --> 1:07:44.680]  let's stop right there back that video up to the secret service coming out of walter read i mean
[1:07:44.680 --> 1:07:49.960]  you look at the body language they're running around like bees out of a beehive this is not a
[1:07:49.960 --> 1:07:57.080]  scheduled visit and you understand they got rid of some of our sources in the white house we have
[1:07:57.080 --> 1:08:04.680]  more and when they want us to know stuff we get it and so i can tell you that mainly has sources i
[1:08:04.680 --> 1:08:09.320]  have sources and they say it's well known there have been many attempts on the president other
[1:08:09.320 --> 1:08:12.760]  people have gotten sick they believe this other secret service agent that was with trump that
[1:08:12.760 --> 1:08:19.320]  died 40 something years old from a massive supposed stroke give me a break all this is going on he
[1:08:19.320 --> 1:08:23.960]  has food tasters he thinks he's being poisoned this is what goes on historically you've got the
[1:08:23.960 --> 1:08:29.960]  attorney general saying that the deep state is doing everything it can everything to sabotage
[1:08:29.960 --> 1:08:33.320]  the executive branch and the president well everything means attempts of violence
[1:08:35.960 --> 1:08:39.800]  and so we'll play that clip again we're gonna go to mike adams and have millie weaver ride shotgun
[1:08:39.800 --> 1:08:45.800]  with us here in a moment but here is bill marable that we can sing let's not have a civil war let's
[1:08:45.800 --> 1:08:53.720]  be friends and obama came out and gave a speech saying the same thing on friday why because if
[1:08:53.720 --> 1:08:59.000]  it came out the president was poisoned later oh well he just had a stroke hey let's not riot we're
[1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:05.960]  all friends now you can see them moving into the conciliatory phase here it's a lot of serious
[1:09:05.960 --> 1:09:11.080]  telltale signs here's a part of what the mouth of the globalist had to say
[1:09:15.160 --> 1:09:20.360]  you can't you can't own your spouse you sometimes just have to make peace with the fact that you're
[1:09:20.360 --> 1:09:27.880]  married to someone who believes in ghosts or won't throw out their baseball cards or thinks
[1:09:27.880 --> 1:09:38.840]  essential oils are essential or yes likes donald trump we are going to have to learn to live
[1:09:38.840 --> 1:09:44.680]  with each other or there will be blood so don't freak out if ellen sits next to george bush at
[1:09:44.680 --> 1:09:49.960]  a football game bush was not my idea of a good president but i never worried that he was going
[1:09:49.960 --> 1:10:06.680]  to lock up his political opponents or reporters or me bush was wrong but he wasn't trying to enrich
[1:10:06.680 --> 1:10:12.360]  george bush he condemned islamophobia after 9 11 and he did a lot for aides in african
[1:10:12.360 --> 1:10:18.200]  countries without calling them holes he risked dick chainie's friendship because he wouldn't
[1:10:18.200 --> 1:10:24.760]  partner pardon scooter liby because it wasn't always just about loyalty he stood with obama
[1:10:24.760 --> 1:10:30.760]  when obama took his job and he said we want you to succeed if you can't see the difference between
[1:10:30.760 --> 1:10:47.800]  that and trump democrats are doomed michelle obama gets it she hugs him ruth bader ginsberg
[1:10:47.800 --> 1:10:54.600]  likes brett cavanaugh for a country that loves to look at pictures of entirely different species
[1:10:54.600 --> 1:11:01.160]  getting along can't we try it in politics and then we'll have the clip for you next segment he he
[1:11:01.160 --> 1:11:07.560]  comes back and he says we don't want a civil war there's a lot of talk about civil war in this country
[1:11:08.680 --> 1:11:13.240]  let me go to the attorney general clip since i mentioned that i do believe we have that clip
[1:11:14.040 --> 1:11:19.320]  and here's the attorney general talking about the attempts at sabotage unfortunately just in the
[1:11:19.320 --> 1:11:25.640]  past few years we have seen this con these conflicts take on an entirely new character
[1:11:27.160 --> 1:11:33.400]  immediately after president trump won election opponents inaugurated what they called the resistance
[1:11:34.440 --> 1:11:42.760]  and they rallied around an explicit strategy of using every tool and maneuver to sabotage
[1:11:42.760 --> 1:11:50.040]  the functioning of the executive branch and his administration the fact of the matter is
[1:11:50.040 --> 1:11:58.440]  that in waging a scorched earth no holds barred war of resistance against this administration
[1:11:59.080 --> 1:12:06.600]  it is the left that is engaged in the systematic shredding of norms and undermining the rule of
[1:12:06.600 --> 1:12:14.120]  law and that's a fact mike adams what do you make of him rush the hospital our source is saying
[1:12:14.120 --> 1:12:21.880]  that somebody got really sick that tested it that they've tested the president to see if he had it
[1:12:21.880 --> 1:12:26.680]  in him he appears to not be sick i mean this just fits into the whole background of what we're
[1:12:26.680 --> 1:12:32.120]  witnessing in this dangerous climate well for many years alex i feared that this kind of food
[1:12:32.120 --> 1:12:37.880]  poisoning doomsday scenario would would appear i've got breaking analysis for you here i'm going
[1:12:37.880 --> 1:12:46.040]  to explain exactly how this is done with a bioengineering of crisper gene editing of weaponized
[1:12:46.040 --> 1:12:53.080]  probiotics to cause the delayed gut production of toxic chemicals now as contacts understand
[1:12:53.080 --> 1:12:57.320]  to your audience i know you know this alex but you know i'm i'm the author of a book called food
[1:12:57.320 --> 1:13:02.920]  forensics this is what i do in my lab i look for contaminants in foods this is my specialty this is
[1:13:02.920 --> 1:13:07.400]  what i do every day with mass spec instruments the way this can be done with a delayed effect
[1:13:07.400 --> 1:13:12.600]  is not to put a chemical in the food itself but to put weaponized genetically engineered
[1:13:12.600 --> 1:13:18.760]  probiotics so to speak in other words active strains of weaponized engineered bacteria
[1:13:18.760 --> 1:13:23.480]  that once they reach the gut and then they start to feed on carbohydrates in particular different
[1:13:23.480 --> 1:13:30.360]  kinds of sugars they then produce as their byproduct toxic chemicals it might take 24 hours
[1:13:30.360 --> 1:13:36.120]  for that to to appear and for symptoms to appear but those chemicals are produced by the bacteria
[1:13:36.120 --> 1:13:41.080]  in the same way the bacteria currently produce vitamin or b vitamins for example or different
[1:13:41.080 --> 1:13:45.560]  kinds of nutrients that are good for you so good bacteria keeps you alive that's why probiotics
[1:13:45.560 --> 1:13:51.400]  are important when they're good but weaponized genetically engineered bad probiotics can be
[1:13:51.400 --> 1:13:58.520]  used to generate toxic chemicals in the gut and kill a person with a delayed action and importantly
[1:13:58.520 --> 1:14:05.640]  alex none of these can be detected by any known chemical analysis system because the chemicals
[1:14:05.640 --> 1:14:11.800]  don't exist until they are synthesized by the bacteria in the gut and i believe this is what
[1:14:11.800 --> 1:14:17.720]  may have happened because crisper gene editing technology is now so readily available so easy
[1:14:17.720 --> 1:14:23.400]  that even deep state scientists in a basement can use this crisper editing to create weaponized
[1:14:23.400 --> 1:14:28.360]  probiotic strains that could have been put into the well it's funny you say that mike because
[1:14:29.480 --> 1:14:33.880]  it's your beyond just investigative journals like your clairvoyant or something you kept
[1:14:33.880 --> 1:14:39.000]  saying months ago i bet there isn't even a whistleblower they just need to say it's a whistleblower
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:44.760]  so no one ever takes credit for making up the initial lie now last week in open house hearing
[1:14:44.760 --> 1:14:50.040]  he came out and admitted uh the the chairman of the committee adam shift that it didn't exist
[1:14:50.040 --> 1:14:55.080]  there was no whistleblower and that he never quote talked to eric siramala which we now know
[1:14:55.080 --> 1:15:00.440]  isn't true uh and so it's the same thing here you've been writing about weaponizing uh gut
[1:15:00.440 --> 1:15:05.080]  florida create poisons like the vaccines are already designed to do uh for years and it was
[1:15:05.080 --> 1:15:10.520]  actually in the news last week in major announcements that the pentagons working on weaponizing gut
[1:15:10.520 --> 1:15:15.640]  bacteria uh and i mean so so you literally are light years ahead of what's happening and that's
[1:15:15.640 --> 1:15:24.120]  just an idea of the type of weird synthetic uh i guess the word would be exotic type of things
[1:15:24.120 --> 1:15:28.200]  that are impossible to find or show up uh that they already use against the american people the
[1:15:28.200 --> 1:15:31.880]  deep state does being used against the president so let's hear more of that from you please stay
[1:15:31.880 --> 1:15:36.440]  with us and millie weaver and the great audience at losers and i do have the club of bill marz
[1:15:36.440 --> 1:15:39.800]  saying civil war we don't want a civil war and then you heard the part where he was saying
[1:15:39.800 --> 1:15:44.440]  let's all kumbaya come together that's all good cop bad cop and really explain why we've reached

[1:18:00.360 --> 1:18:06.280]  in the korean war when three million chai comms had flooded across the border and surrounded
[1:18:06.280 --> 1:18:13.800]  the marines more than 50 to 1 some estimates have it but the point is they were outnumbered and the
[1:18:13.800 --> 1:18:21.240]  general was told general were completely surrounded said good we can attack in all directions well
[1:18:21.240 --> 1:18:27.400]  that's the point that info wars has reached and it really is epic it really is biblical and we
[1:18:27.400 --> 1:18:32.840]  wouldn't have gone this far without all your support but it's going to become more critical
[1:18:33.480 --> 1:18:39.560]  than ever as the censorship becomes complete and it's not just americans but folks all over the
[1:18:39.560 --> 1:18:45.320]  world are completely silenced when it comes to speak in the name of a cia fake whistleblower or
[1:18:45.320 --> 1:18:51.560]  exposing a pedophile or speaking out against dangerous vaccines because by info wars having
[1:18:51.560 --> 1:18:59.720]  its own platform that checkmates the globalist i've made a lot of predictions that have come
[1:18:59.720 --> 1:19:05.560]  true but i'm here to tell you most of those really weren't predictions that came out of a
[1:19:05.560 --> 1:19:11.320]  crystal ball i could see where the globalists were going i could see what their in-game agenda
[1:19:11.320 --> 1:19:17.160]  was what their goal was and i knew that when they were setting a sub to bd platform that they were
[1:19:17.160 --> 1:19:24.840]  really setting the precedent to take everybody off air to to silence everyone to ban words and
[1:19:24.840 --> 1:19:31.400]  names and information on fake whistleblowers so that their false narratives couldn't be opposed
[1:19:31.400 --> 1:19:38.440]  what the globalists really feared was independent media and platforms in the future it was the model
[1:19:38.440 --> 1:19:44.360]  of info wars as much as the information that had to be silenced because they need total
[1:19:44.360 --> 1:19:49.160]  information dominance for their outrageous lies and the evil they're pushing to succeed and that's
[1:19:49.160 --> 1:19:54.120]  why keeping info wars on the air is now more imperative and more vital than ever
[1:19:54.120 --> 1:20:01.480]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:20:01.480 --> 1:20:14.840]  so
[1:20:17.720 --> 1:20:26.040]  info wars dot com is tomorrow's news today you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:20:26.040 --> 1:20:39.000]  now lately you've been hearing more and more about a second civil war which sounds impossible
[1:20:39.000 --> 1:20:46.120]  in this modern affluent country it is not we all talk about trump as an existential threat but
[1:20:46.120 --> 1:20:52.200]  his side sees democratic control of government the exact same way and when both sides believe
[1:20:52.200 --> 1:20:58.520]  the other guy taking over means the end of the world yes you can have a civil war trump rallies
[1:20:58.520 --> 1:21:04.840]  are filled with words like enemies of the people human scum they talk of people to be locked up
[1:21:06.520 --> 1:21:13.320]  well you can't lock us all up liberals are described as weak lame coddling oversensitive
[1:21:13.320 --> 1:21:23.880]  and limp-dicked which are strong words for a bunch of mouth-breather kickers knuckle-draggers
[1:21:27.720 --> 1:21:31.960]  and the disgrace donna brazil that tried to rig the election and did rig the debate she's up there
[1:21:31.960 --> 1:21:41.080]  with her new makeover mike adams is here with us natural news dot com millie weaver with her sources
[1:21:41.080 --> 1:21:50.760]  is also giving us a lot of key intel uh mike it just goes to the climate we're in that of course
[1:21:50.760 --> 1:21:53.880]  they're trying to kill the president of course they're trying to drug him of course they want
[1:21:53.880 --> 1:21:59.240]  25th uh amendment and her sources are saying they believe that someone's been trying to stick
[1:21:59.240 --> 1:22:06.680]  anti psychotics uh into uh his food and drink as well we know the president's concerned about it
[1:22:06.680 --> 1:22:15.320]  this is just such a giant story this unannounced visit uh to the hospital walter read on saturday
[1:22:15.320 --> 1:22:20.280]  almost no coverage through sunday and now the stories disappeared you're a really good guy
[1:22:20.280 --> 1:22:25.080]  scanning the entire spectrum and giving amazing analysis what do you think's really happening
[1:22:25.080 --> 1:22:30.520]  here well i believe that over the weekend there were multiple attempts on the life of president
[1:22:30.520 --> 1:22:34.680]  trump i think that what you're reporting here today is only one of several you're probably hearing
[1:22:34.680 --> 1:22:38.520]  this also from some of your sources i would imagine but it's not it's just not confirmed yet so you
[1:22:38.520 --> 1:22:44.840]  haven't reported it but i'm hearing it as well um what's crucial to understand here is this food
[1:22:44.840 --> 1:22:50.760]  poisoning vector it is impossible using modern day technology the best technology in the world
[1:22:50.760 --> 1:22:57.400]  which i own by the way in in my lab you cannot detect exotic molecules that are engineered
[1:22:57.960 --> 1:23:02.200]  as poisons and you cannot detect probiotics that are engineered to generate poison so
[1:23:02.200 --> 1:23:06.040]  it doesn't matter how many tests they have a lot of the the american people think that oh you can
[1:23:06.040 --> 1:23:10.360]  you can run this battery of tests and automatically spot a poison that's in the food in
[1:23:10.360 --> 1:23:17.160]  60 seconds not at all it doesn't work like that at all you could spend months actually trying to
[1:23:17.160 --> 1:23:21.480]  find every molecule and you would still would there could be molecules to slip past you that
[1:23:21.480 --> 1:23:26.360]  you don't know that you were by the way mike i should have set up front you own a large certified
[1:23:26.360 --> 1:23:32.680]  food and product testing facility you have over 300 natural health sites you're your publisher all
[1:23:32.680 --> 1:23:38.200]  over the world i mean you're actually a leading expert on uh adulterated food and and and how
[1:23:38.200 --> 1:23:42.760]  to spot it so it's a real blessing to have you be able to speak to this that that is our specialty
[1:23:42.760 --> 1:23:47.960]  and so what's important to note is if you don't know what molecule you're looking for then you
[1:23:47.960 --> 1:23:52.440]  you have to use what's called a mass spec time of flight instrument time of flight instrument
[1:23:52.440 --> 1:23:59.240]  gives you a full full scan a full spectrum of molecules from a a range of masses but even then
[1:23:59.240 --> 1:24:03.720]  if you don't use the right solvents in the extraction technique of the food sample
[1:24:03.720 --> 1:24:08.760]  you won't get chemicals that you you would otherwise get if you use a different solvent
[1:24:08.760 --> 1:24:15.560]  so there are a battery of solvents methanol hexane acetonitrile water and so on certain
[1:24:15.560 --> 1:24:20.120]  chemicals are only soluble in certain solvents so unless you're you're running every possible
[1:24:20.120 --> 1:24:25.880]  solvent with every possible negative mode positive mode of the instrument every possible
[1:24:25.880 --> 1:24:30.840]  chromatography column you know there's no way that you can find everything again it would take
[1:24:30.840 --> 1:24:36.840]  months we spent two and a half years developing a method just to get retention of glyphosate
[1:24:36.840 --> 1:24:42.440]  by the way two and a half years on that one chemical that one molecule so if they want to
[1:24:42.440 --> 1:24:49.160]  poison president trump there is no lab in the world that will be able to spot a specifically
[1:24:49.160 --> 1:24:53.720]  engineered chemical that is that's different from the normal chemicals i mean yeah arsenic
[1:24:53.720 --> 1:24:59.320]  that's easy you can spot that in in a few minutes and that's why president trump is smart on record
[1:25:00.040 --> 1:25:03.400]  sending trusted people out to get him food from random restaurants he knows
[1:25:04.040 --> 1:25:09.080]  he can't eat that food and it's been documented that at state parties and things he doesn't even
[1:25:09.080 --> 1:25:14.280]  eat his food most of the time that's right but i wouldn't put it past the deep state to find out
[1:25:14.280 --> 1:25:19.400]  where trump is staying and go poison the food in all the restaurants that are nearby because they
[1:25:19.400 --> 1:25:24.200]  don't care if they kill innocent people and i think as an investigative journalist it would be
[1:25:24.200 --> 1:25:30.200]  very informative to look have there been food poisoning outbreaks in the cities where trump
[1:25:30.200 --> 1:25:34.040]  is visiting because that would be indicative of the scenario that i'm talking about right now
[1:25:34.040 --> 1:25:38.040]  this is exactly how the left operates there are a bunch of cowards there are a bunch of scum
[1:25:38.040 --> 1:25:42.520]  they love putting the floor out in the water things the vaccines soft hills secret weapons is
[1:25:42.520 --> 1:25:48.760]  their obsession it's their religion milley weaver any other points you'd like to add that
[1:25:48.760 --> 1:25:53.640]  mike's breakdown has spurred you to want to bring forward yes that's very interesting
[1:25:53.640 --> 1:25:59.320]  that you say that mike because i just read an article recently that was talking about oh by the
[1:25:59.320 --> 1:26:05.240]  way the president chef's favorite market of choice is the whole foods down the road from the
[1:26:05.240 --> 1:26:10.280]  white house so i could totally see them deciding to put heavy metals and other different chemicals
[1:26:10.280 --> 1:26:14.040]  in the food if they really wanted to take the president out hell they wouldn't have to they
[1:26:14.040 --> 1:26:18.760]  wouldn't have to ask i mean jeff bezos owns that i'm not saying he's poison the food but
[1:26:18.760 --> 1:26:23.080]  leftists will do anything the stories i've confirmed of people doing stuff to the food
[1:26:23.080 --> 1:26:27.720]  of sean hannity and and others is i mean think about how the left is regardless they wouldn't
[1:26:27.720 --> 1:26:32.360]  even need a deep state operation the amount of demonization and brainwashing will just organically
[1:26:32.360 --> 1:26:37.800]  created with maxine waters saying when they're at restaurants attack them well there's how's
[1:26:37.800 --> 1:26:42.040]  the leftist gonna attack you they're gonna jack with your food millie yeah and another
[1:26:42.040 --> 1:26:45.880]  important thing to remember is that if the president really just wanted to get lab work
[1:26:45.880 --> 1:26:49.400]  and blood tests done he could have done it at the white house so why would he've gone to the
[1:26:49.400 --> 1:26:54.040]  hospital well it's really simple because if you were being food poisoned they didn't know whether
[1:26:54.040 --> 1:26:59.480]  or not he might have a serious reaction to where he needed serious medical intervention that's why
[1:26:59.480 --> 1:27:05.000]  he went to the hospital and again your sources say i mean i know that the chef is his taster
[1:27:05.000 --> 1:27:09.320]  there's also secret service does the tasting that that's confirmed in the news your sources
[1:27:09.320 --> 1:27:15.080]  are saying it was a chef or secret service or did they say specifically who got sick i believe it
[1:27:15.080 --> 1:27:20.680]  was a secret service agent um think about it the president travels so he's not always going to be
[1:27:20.680 --> 1:27:25.480]  able to take his chef necessarily with him but he would have secret service with him as well
[1:27:25.480 --> 1:27:30.040]  and we have a secret service agent last year in july in scotland uh 40 something years old
[1:27:30.040 --> 1:27:38.360]  reportedly great shape dropping dead they said of a of a stroke mike adams uh yes and in fact
[1:27:38.360 --> 1:27:42.600]  there have been other mysterious events of course surrounding i mean roger stone was
[1:27:42.600 --> 1:27:46.760]  attempted to be poisoned with i think it was bologna so there are radio isotopes that could
[1:27:46.760 --> 1:27:51.640]  be at work here but again i have to bring you back to the the crisper gene edited weaponized
[1:27:51.640 --> 1:27:57.720]  probiotics alex because that's the technology that can evade all detection there aren't radio
[1:27:57.720 --> 1:28:01.560]  isotopes well that was in the news last week the pentagon's looking at crisper to just take
[1:28:01.560 --> 1:28:07.160]  normal normal bacteria and things and change it to weaponize it and then and even tailor it for a
[1:28:07.160 --> 1:28:13.160]  certain person well absolutely there's something else i got to mention it's called rna interference
[1:28:13.160 --> 1:28:19.400]  rna interference technology uh your producers should should pull this up it has been touted as a
[1:28:19.400 --> 1:28:26.200]  a special kind of a pesticide that targets the specific physiological functions of pests in crops
[1:28:26.200 --> 1:28:33.240]  and by targeting the the dna and the rna of a bugs they can design a substance that will
[1:28:33.240 --> 1:28:39.880]  kill that pathway of respiration or digestion for a specific organism and they can tailor it to your
[1:28:39.880 --> 1:28:46.680]  dna that's rna rna interference rna interference let's talk about that when we come back and

[1:31:00.280 --> 1:31:10.120]  jefferson what is the level of tyranny that a tyrant will take humanity too how far will they
[1:31:10.120 --> 1:31:16.840]  go what's their limit and he said it is the limit to which other men and women will submit
[1:31:18.120 --> 1:31:26.280]  the answer is there is no limit to evil it is a bottomless pit we've been taught in modern culture
[1:31:26.280 --> 1:31:33.240]  and society that evil doesn't exist or that there's no free will there's no devil or the god but
[1:31:33.240 --> 1:31:39.560]  those very same people have all these rules for us about speech and how we can dress and
[1:31:40.200 --> 1:31:45.720]  where we can live and what our houses can be like they just don't want us to have any values
[1:31:45.720 --> 1:31:51.880]  so they can run over us oxford's band clapping universities the us of band 21 gun salutes for
[1:31:51.880 --> 1:31:58.040]  veterans these people are dangerous cult leaders and it's time to reject them the globalists know
[1:31:58.040 --> 1:32:05.240]  that i will never willingly give up i've said it many times i will never give in i will never give
[1:32:05.240 --> 1:32:11.560]  up but i could give out and it's very very frustrating to see them committing all their
[1:32:11.560 --> 1:32:18.840]  crimes against humanity to see evil running rampant like this and to know that most americans
[1:32:18.840 --> 1:32:24.360]  have already been silenced in cyberspace that most americans have already been shadow banned
[1:32:24.360 --> 1:32:31.160]  by big tech and to know that most americans feel powerless and don't realize how much power they
[1:32:31.160 --> 1:32:38.280]  have by spreading the word about news wars dot com info wars dot com and band on video and that
[1:32:38.280 --> 1:32:43.480]  people are hungry for the truth now more than ever and then if you tell people hey the band truth
[1:32:43.480 --> 1:32:49.560]  they don't want you to have is it info wars dot com forward slash show and band on video so take
[1:32:49.560 --> 1:32:53.960]  heart folks they've had to censor everybody to show everybody down because the truth is powerful
[1:32:53.960 --> 1:33:02.520]  and they can't beat us fair and square you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:33:02.520 --> 1:33:18.040]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[1:33:21.400 --> 1:33:25.000]  all right ladies and gentlemen i'm going to give the number out i'm going to start taking calls
[1:33:25.000 --> 1:33:32.040]  throughout the third hour a little bit into the fourth hour today and then gerryl salante takes over
[1:33:33.800 --> 1:33:37.480]  mike Adams from natural news dot com is here investigative journalist millie weaver
[1:33:37.480 --> 1:33:43.000]  is here she works with info wars and she's got her great sources in the winehouse she travels
[1:33:43.000 --> 1:33:47.960]  around the country and has met with a lot of them and they they tell us it's just routine that they
[1:33:47.960 --> 1:33:53.160]  have people trying to poison the president i mean what do you expect they're doing everything
[1:33:53.160 --> 1:33:58.680]  they can to sabotage the president as the attorney general said mike adams other big
[1:33:58.680 --> 1:34:03.880]  points you'd like to make about this and just the overall urgency of the entire political
[1:34:03.880 --> 1:34:09.080]  climate we're in well over the weekend there was an unconfirmed report i have to underscore
[1:34:09.080 --> 1:34:16.200]  unconfirmed that the the leaders of the telecom giants were ordered to stand by for a nationwide
[1:34:16.200 --> 1:34:23.720]  disconnect order or selective disconnect order because of some impending activity or event now
[1:34:23.720 --> 1:34:30.600]  again that's unconfirmed i'm working on trying to confirm this report but it's it goes along with
[1:34:30.600 --> 1:34:36.760]  the idea that the left wants to assassinate the president and then cut off all conservative voices
[1:34:36.760 --> 1:34:42.760]  while they unleash their kinetic hot civil war phase all while people like bill mara are claiming
[1:34:42.760 --> 1:34:47.720]  that they don't want civil war if they don't want to overthrow america why are they trying to overthrow
[1:34:47.720 --> 1:34:53.320]  america by ousting the president right if they believe in freedom and liberty why are the tech
[1:34:53.320 --> 1:35:00.040]  giants selectively censoring nearly all prominent conservative voices they talk with they speak with
[1:35:00.040 --> 1:35:05.800]  forked tongues people like bill mara it's it's shameful it's pathetic they are the ones who
[1:35:05.800 --> 1:35:09.000]  are trying to push this coup they are the ones trying to overthrow this country they're the ones
[1:35:09.000 --> 1:35:13.560]  calling for the death of the president and they're the ones censoring conservatives so
[1:35:13.560 --> 1:35:18.040]  things are about to happen alex i mean the attempt was made this weekend multiple times on
[1:35:18.040 --> 1:35:23.000]  trump's life and they're not done trying so buckle up everybody what's going to happen over the next
[1:35:23.000 --> 1:35:29.800]  seven days uh could be rather shocking i'll just put it that way undoubtedly when you have the
[1:35:29.800 --> 1:35:34.200]  attorney general saying the deep states doing everything it can to sabotage the executive
[1:35:34.200 --> 1:35:39.800]  branch and overthrow it that means physical everything he was reading off of a speech he'd
[1:35:39.800 --> 1:35:46.200]  written he was being very specific and saying they've shredded all norms that they were doing
[1:35:46.200 --> 1:35:51.800]  everything you could to sabotage he was a very clear to the federalist society millie waver
[1:35:52.920 --> 1:35:57.800]  well you know i was thinking a lot about that too especially about bill mara's statement
[1:35:57.800 --> 1:36:03.240]  it seems to me like they are planning some big event either it's going to be just stealing the
[1:36:03.240 --> 1:36:09.640]  election all out with election rigging in 2020 or maybe poisoning or assassinating the president
[1:36:09.640 --> 1:36:14.520]  and what they would want to do after that is figure out a way to maybe deescalate the trump
[1:36:14.520 --> 1:36:21.000]  supporters and the entire programming of hate so that then then they just get everyone to calm down
[1:36:21.000 --> 1:36:27.160]  we they'll take back over control and then they'll slowly then reimplement all of their globalist
[1:36:27.160 --> 1:36:33.480]  policies into america i totally agree that right before they launch kinetic violence and false
[1:36:33.480 --> 1:36:38.520]  flags to blame us they're going to say we want peace we want freedom so the media can cover that
[1:36:38.520 --> 1:36:45.400]  when they launch their attack that's a classic uh sucker punch uh move millie oh yeah because if
[1:36:45.400 --> 1:36:51.960]  they were to escalate and then take him out then then what then they have a civil war and they don't
[1:36:51.960 --> 1:36:56.920]  know they can't necessarily predict the outcome of the civil war if there were one so the best
[1:36:56.920 --> 1:37:02.280]  thing to do is to steal it steal it from the president rig 2020 or assassinate him and then
[1:37:02.280 --> 1:37:09.160]  rapidly deescalate everything and try to get back control of the populace that's what i would think
[1:37:09.160 --> 1:37:14.200]  but they're they're too they're too late uh the american people already know that if trump is taken
[1:37:14.200 --> 1:37:19.240]  out no matter what method is used to take him out the american people i believe will spontaneously
[1:37:19.240 --> 1:37:24.680]  rise up and defend their nation against these deep state traders the treason the criminal
[1:37:24.680 --> 1:37:30.520]  uh insiders who are trying to topple this nation i think the american people understand exactly what's
[1:37:30.520 --> 1:37:34.920]  going on and of course like you say alex they'll they'll try to make it look like a natural death
[1:37:35.480 --> 1:37:39.640]  but the american people aren't going to be fooled at this point the deep state has been exposed
[1:37:39.640 --> 1:37:43.560]  we now know they're real we now know they're criminals we know they're treasonous actors
[1:37:43.560 --> 1:37:49.400]  and we know that they hate this constitutional republic so the spontaneous organic uprising
[1:37:49.400 --> 1:37:54.760]  is already baked in as far as i'm concerned i'm not i'm not calling for it i'm just saying it's already
[1:37:54.760 --> 1:37:58.520]  going to happen that's right they can they can say they want peace while at the grassroots they
[1:37:58.520 --> 1:38:02.840]  push wars with their proxies they can they can say they want peace while they have some fluoride
[1:38:02.840 --> 1:38:07.960]  and 5g and gmo and everything else we will continue to watch this at naturalnews.com
[1:38:07.960 --> 1:38:11.640]  mike there's an excellent article that you put up there you of course broke the marines being
[1:38:11.640 --> 1:38:15.960]  activated to protect the president that's of course been confirmed and emily weaver your
[1:38:15.960 --> 1:38:20.760]  sources and contacts please stay with them obviously file reports as they come out on
[1:38:20.760 --> 1:38:25.240]  your site millennium millie.com and call us the minute things break we'll get you back on millie
[1:38:25.240 --> 1:38:35.720]  thank you thank you alex thank you mike adams thank you okay i was already going where mike
[1:38:35.720 --> 1:38:44.360]  adams went today and we hadn't talked about weaponization of food separately before you
[1:38:44.360 --> 1:38:49.000]  talk about the president being poisoned or attempts to poison him but everything the
[1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:53.960]  globalists do on the mass skill to us is what they're trying to do to trump i mean you understand
[1:38:55.480 --> 1:39:00.760]  that bill melinda gates are into weather modification force vaccines and they have
[1:39:00.760 --> 1:39:06.040]  spent billions on studying gut flora crises knowing that what the deep state's done to our
[1:39:06.040 --> 1:39:11.000]  gut by design is wrecking everybody so this was already in my stack before mike adams brought it
[1:39:11.000 --> 1:39:19.800]  up look at this new rna interference crop technology weaponizes food into the ultimate eugenics weapon
[1:39:20.920 --> 1:39:27.880]  food target blacks for covert sterilization and he goes through what it actually does
[1:39:29.320 --> 1:39:35.960]  millennials are sick and getting sicker increasing healthcare cost moody's tracking it gets into the
[1:39:35.960 --> 1:39:42.520]  fact that america and the west is so incredibly sick with all the vaccines all the gmo us life
[1:39:42.520 --> 1:39:51.240]  expectancy has been declining here's why infant mortality is way up and it's falling faster
[1:39:51.240 --> 1:39:57.800]  and faster year after year doesn't take a decade to see it on the graph we're losing years a year now
[1:39:57.800 --> 1:40:05.000]  did you hear that we're going from one in 35 000 with autistic type issues to one in 50 something
[1:40:06.600 --> 1:40:11.480]  and soon it'll be one in 10 then one in five it's exponential by the time you figure out
[1:40:11.480 --> 1:40:19.640]  what hit you it's over think about that think about what they're doing and think about how
[1:40:20.200 --> 1:40:24.600]  they have put bacteria into the food chain that go and take out the good bacteria in your gut
[1:40:24.600 --> 1:40:33.800]  who then don't create the fermentation that creates amino acid chains in the gut that heal
[1:40:33.800 --> 1:40:39.960]  the body and then it accelerates aging let me show you this was already in my stack today
[1:40:43.400 --> 1:40:47.400]  before mike adams brought that up before any of this let me show tv viewers
[1:40:47.400 --> 1:40:55.240]  researchers working on food based treatment to slow aging science daily and then it's got links
[1:40:55.240 --> 1:41:03.640]  to three major universities the nang yang technology university singapore that's one of the top
[1:41:03.640 --> 1:41:10.920]  ones in the world and then it goes into us facilities and universities and it explains
[1:41:10.920 --> 1:41:21.000]  that the hormone called fgf 21 pro longevity heals the entire body and actually reverses aging but
[1:41:21.000 --> 1:41:33.640]  is only made in the lower intestine so it's not just your body is getting nutrients from plants
[1:41:33.640 --> 1:41:44.280]  and things you eat it's making them and these are compounds that you have to have these certain
[1:41:44.280 --> 1:41:50.520]  foods with certain ring structures and and and and and trace elements and things they have
[1:41:50.520 --> 1:41:56.360]  that then with the right bacteria in your gut grows this oh and what does it say
[1:41:56.360 --> 1:42:04.120]  it's fiber from a spectrum of certain types of berries that grows this
[1:42:05.080 --> 1:42:11.960]  and yes this is a plug in 50 seconds gut fusion fiber and glutamate that it takes the glutamate
[1:42:11.960 --> 1:42:19.480]  with the fiber to grow this and what do we have in this high auric berry blend strawberry
[1:42:19.480 --> 1:42:26.600]  blueberry blackberry cranberry escobleo grape and palm granite it's the pulp from them
[1:42:28.600 --> 1:42:36.200]  that then with the glutamate glutamine grows this i'm not the scientist that came up with
[1:42:36.200 --> 1:42:42.120]  this but you just notice this is it in foreshore.com specifically for your lower intestines to grow
[1:42:42.120 --> 1:42:46.040]  this and that's what it does and you read the study everything they say that's not just everything
[1:42:46.040 --> 1:42:51.000]  they say the study studies right here it's all right here we already see see and then it funds
[1:42:51.000 --> 1:42:54.440]  our operation win-win for everybody we'll be right back with the phone number to call us
[1:42:56.040 --> 1:43:02.200]  there's a famous quote by a marine corps general in the korean war when three million
[1:43:02.200 --> 1:43:08.920]  chai comms had flooded across the border and surrounded the marines more than 50 to 1 some
[1:43:08.920 --> 1:43:14.840]  estimates have it but the point is they were outnumbered and the general was told general
[1:43:14.840 --> 1:43:21.080]  were completely surrounded he said good we can attack in all directions well that's the point
[1:43:21.080 --> 1:43:27.000]  that info wars has reached and it really is epic it really is biblical and we wouldn't have gone
[1:43:27.000 --> 1:43:35.000]  this far without all your support but it's going to become more critical than ever as the censorship
[1:43:35.000 --> 1:43:40.120]  becomes complete and it's not just americans but folks all over the world are completely silenced
[1:43:40.120 --> 1:43:47.320]  when it comes to speaking the name of a cia fake whistleblower or exposing a pedophile or speaking
[1:43:47.320 --> 1:43:53.000]  out against dangerous vaccines because by info wars having its own platform that check mates the
[1:43:53.000 --> 1:44:02.360]  globalist info wars life has done it again with undoubtedly our biggest breakthrough yet super
[1:44:02.360 --> 1:44:09.560]  silver whitening toothpaste this is proprietary this is with the top lab in the country and it
[1:44:09.560 --> 1:44:15.320]  is incredibly high quality this is the best toothpaste you're going to find it's called
[1:44:15.320 --> 1:44:20.680]  whitening toothpaste but really it knocks out the bacteria it recalcifies the teeth it does so
[1:44:20.680 --> 1:44:27.800]  many things on so many fronts these beautiful tubes of super silver toothpaste are available at an
[1:44:27.800 --> 1:44:33.640]  introductory price of 25 off out of the gates as low as we can go and they're going to sell out
[1:44:33.640 --> 1:44:40.120]  very very quickly super silver whitening toothpaste is going to be a hit i'm very very proud of it
[1:44:40.120 --> 1:44:45.160]  i want to thank my father a retired dentist for spearheading this the last two years and developing
[1:44:45.160 --> 1:44:50.120]  it it's 25 off out of the gates that's as low as we can go because it's very very expensive
[1:44:50.120 --> 1:44:53.880]  to produce get yours today at info wars life dot com
[1:44:57.720 --> 1:45:02.440]  i've made a lot of predictions that have come true but i'm here to tell you that most of those
[1:45:02.440 --> 1:45:08.360]  really weren't predictions that came out of a crystal ball i could see where the globalists
[1:45:08.360 --> 1:45:14.440]  were going i could see what their in-game agenda was what their goal was and i knew that when they
[1:45:14.440 --> 1:45:19.880]  were setting a sub to bd platformed that they were really setting the precedent to take everybody
[1:45:20.520 --> 1:45:28.280]  off air to to silence everyone to ban words and names and information on fake whistleblowers
[1:45:28.280 --> 1:45:33.560]  so that their false narratives couldn't be opposed what the globalists really feared
[1:45:33.560 --> 1:45:40.280]  was independent media and platforms in the future it was the model of info wars as much as the
[1:45:40.280 --> 1:45:46.440]  information that had to be silenced because they need total information dominance for their outrageous
[1:45:46.440 --> 1:45:51.240]  lies and the evil they're pushing to succeed and that's why keeping info wars on the air
[1:45:51.240 --> 1:46:01.080]  is now more imperative and more vital than ever info wars presents the alex jones show you supporting
[1:46:01.080 --> 1:46:05.080]  the broadcast over the years is why we're still here so that's why you spreading the word is so
[1:46:05.080 --> 1:46:08.360]  critical and that's why buying the products is critical because these are great products you

[1:47:49.400 --> 1:47:59.480]  November 18th 2019 monday edition okay let me do this i want to give the number out so callers
[1:47:59.480 --> 1:48:06.920]  can call in about the president's unexpected visit to the hospital rush to visit and our sources that
[1:48:06.920 --> 1:48:14.200]  one of the tasters got very very sick and then it made me go back and review the news and see all
[1:48:14.200 --> 1:48:20.040]  the coverage of the white house concerned and people getting sick and people dying and the
[1:48:20.040 --> 1:48:26.200]  president not trusting the food that's an amazing story in and of itself but you add the 25th amendment
[1:48:26.200 --> 1:48:32.600]  calls to remove him from mental illness the coup calls the civil war calls and now suddenly obama
[1:48:32.600 --> 1:48:38.360]  and bill mar another saying let's not have a civil war let's not be violent on the eve of whatever
[1:48:38.360 --> 1:48:44.760]  just unfolded i mean you can really see them covering all the basis right now exactly how
[1:48:44.760 --> 1:48:49.720]  i would expect them to do right before they trigger big false flags attempts on the president's life
[1:48:49.720 --> 1:48:56.360]  you name it but just like we were dead on about the neocons in the white house and the soros people
[1:48:56.360 --> 1:49:04.120]  and McMaster and fiona hill and the treasury and eric ciramala that was all i was attacked in
[1:49:04.120 --> 1:49:08.840]  cfr publications two and a half years ago for exposing him by name with our guests
[1:49:10.360 --> 1:49:16.680]  this reportedly really went on or our white house sources have given us good info to now
[1:49:16.680 --> 1:49:21.800]  later give us bad info and i don't really see a reason for that seeing in first put it out that he
[1:49:24.200 --> 1:49:30.360]  went there and then when it didn't fit into what they wanted
[1:49:30.360 --> 1:49:39.560]  then it suddenly just kind of disappeared out of the news i want to take your phone calls
[1:49:40.120 --> 1:49:45.880]  on that subject and other subjects and on the attorney general uh coming out and saying that
[1:49:45.880 --> 1:49:51.160]  the deep state the democrats the leftist is the term he uses are doing everything they can to sabotage
[1:49:51.160 --> 1:49:59.480]  the presidency doing everything they can uh to remove the president well that that would mean
[1:49:59.480 --> 1:50:04.680]  physical uh as well so i'm gonna give first time callers a chance to call in that means first time
[1:50:04.680 --> 1:50:11.560]  callers uh to give us your take on this and uh you think we're making the story up you're welcome
[1:50:11.560 --> 1:50:15.720]  to call in if you if you hope the president's gonna die i don't want to say you're welcome but you
[1:50:15.720 --> 1:50:22.360]  can call in i mean whatever subject you want to discuss in and around the deep state's attempt
[1:50:22.360 --> 1:50:27.480]  to remove the president that cannot be denied and and and what you think of why he went to the hospital
[1:50:27.480 --> 1:50:33.400]  uh and where all of this is going but the full reports are on info wars dot com and news wars
[1:50:33.400 --> 1:50:39.960]  dot com with the live feed of this show so that people can tune in uh and actually have a larger
[1:50:39.960 --> 1:50:45.640]  debate about this president trump rushed the hospital secret service feared poisoning after
[1:50:45.640 --> 1:50:51.320]  taster fell ill watch live alex jones talks to millie weaver who delivers groundbreaking details
[1:50:51.320 --> 1:51:02.360]  on this and more now i also have it's reposted info wars dot com an hour i did with roger stone
[1:51:03.640 --> 1:51:09.720]  on september 11 2017 laying a lot of this out and the attempts to poison him them and the
[1:51:09.720 --> 1:51:16.360]  attempts to drug him we've got a clip from that that youtube of course is removed imagine how
[1:51:16.360 --> 1:51:19.880]  freaked out the deep state was that we knew all this but i'm going to be airing part of that at
[1:51:19.880 --> 1:51:29.400]  the start of the next hour as well also we're going to get to kanye west protect your kids from
[1:51:29.400 --> 1:51:34.360]  being indoctrinated by hollywood and the media that clip is coming up the toll free number to
[1:51:34.360 --> 1:51:47.480]  join us is 8777892539877789 alex first time callers on the state of civil war who the players are
[1:51:47.480 --> 1:51:53.160]  are uh why you think obama and bill marr saying we don't want a civil war let's all be friends
[1:51:53.720 --> 1:51:59.400]  while they intensify their undermining their impeachments their attacks election fraud in
[1:51:59.400 --> 1:52:04.760]  louisiana election fraud in kentucky election fraud in virginia every new race trump goes
[1:52:04.760 --> 1:52:10.280]  from winning every new race to losing every race despite the fact that in real polls trump is
[1:52:10.280 --> 1:52:14.840]  more popular than ever because they're making their move and he hasn't been able to get the
[1:52:14.840 --> 1:52:19.000]  justice department to make their movement on the deep state he hasn't been able to get him to stop
[1:52:19.000 --> 1:52:27.480]  the election fraud so that has green lit ladies and gentlemen them doing more bold moves like
[1:52:27.480 --> 1:52:32.120]  you're now seeing first they wanted to drug him make him loopy say 25th amendment that wasn't
[1:52:32.120 --> 1:52:38.360]  consistently successful he started not eating food in the white house started only eating out of cans
[1:52:39.880 --> 1:52:43.480]  like the movie the thing where you know they're all frozen in the outpost and this alien shape
[1:52:43.480 --> 1:52:47.880]  shift was taken over and everybody's got to eat out of canned food because it might be the shape
[1:52:47.880 --> 1:52:53.720]  shifts are preparing the meals and it's going to spike it you imagine living like that will you do
[1:52:54.440 --> 1:53:02.760]  the scientific dictatorship the technocracy has been jacking with vaccines food the water
[1:53:02.760 --> 1:53:08.360]  and now the genetic code of the planet for a long time and they admit they've been doing it for a long
[1:53:08.360 --> 1:53:15.240]  time obama's science are wrote in 1974 and eco science how they would use vaccines that were
[1:53:15.240 --> 1:53:21.800]  tainted and chemicals in the water to control the population and our iq is going straight down
[1:53:23.000 --> 1:53:27.640]  our fertility is going straight down cancer and other diseases like neurological disorders
[1:53:27.640 --> 1:53:34.920]  are going straight up and there are massive propaganda pushes through cnn 10 that is shown
[1:53:34.920 --> 1:53:41.000]  in all the public schools in first period and tiktok filled with globalist propaganda that
[1:53:41.000 --> 1:53:47.800]  i was going to get to today but i'll do it tomorrow brainwashing the youth and telling them vaccines
[1:53:47.800 --> 1:53:53.400]  make you live longer there's no danger in the vaccines and all these incredible hoaxes and lies
[1:53:54.280 --> 1:54:03.160]  it really is an incredible time to be alive right now now i started talking about this last segment
[1:54:03.160 --> 1:54:07.400]  and i'm going to talk about it again right now and then start the next hour and get to all the news
[1:54:07.400 --> 1:54:11.320]  and all the clips and all the rest of it and the latest jeffrey fstein bomb shells that are
[1:54:11.320 --> 1:54:17.240]  bigger than ever and how it ties in the royal family and why the duke did that disastrous
[1:54:17.240 --> 1:54:24.440]  interview i mean i'm loaded for bear here and i love salente hosting the fourth hour on monday's
[1:54:24.440 --> 1:54:28.040]  and he understands when i preempt him but i'm only going to preempt 15 minutes of him to hit
[1:54:28.040 --> 1:54:34.040]  more news but i'm going to take calls next hour but let me just spend a little time here at the
[1:54:34.040 --> 1:54:40.680]  end explaining this if you don't get these products from me you can find these products
[1:54:40.680 --> 1:54:45.800]  elsewhere that are almost as good or as good in some cases they'll probably cost you more money but
[1:54:45.800 --> 1:54:50.920]  still gravity-fed water filtration you need to be filtering your water with a system that cuts
[1:54:50.920 --> 1:54:56.600]  the garbage out not just bad flavor we have the best systems at m4score.com you need to not be
[1:54:56.600 --> 1:55:03.400]  eating gmo you need to understand the vaccines are tainted by design and i was just reading all
[1:55:03.400 --> 1:55:09.640]  these big studies coming out about how the lower intestine creates literal special amino acids that
[1:55:09.640 --> 1:55:15.880]  can only be made in the human gut and synthesize there and take it into the bloodstream with
[1:55:15.880 --> 1:55:20.520]  certain compounds in nature and how the globalists all know this and are doing everything they can
[1:55:20.520 --> 1:55:28.360]  to put bad bacteria into you that block that and literally turn off your repair system
[1:55:30.520 --> 1:55:35.800]  gut fusion is half the price of brands that have a similar formulas and i'm just proud of our
[1:55:35.800 --> 1:55:40.040]  researchers because i'm not the experts have the experts i trust go out and do it and they put out
[1:55:40.040 --> 1:55:52.200]  this orac akadia fiber orac flax seed organic sprouts blend apple fruit fiber blueberry fiber
[1:55:52.200 --> 1:56:01.720]  organic organic cranberry fruit fiber resisted orac is this is high orac berry blend with
[1:56:01.720 --> 1:56:08.520]  grape and pomegranate blackberry cranberry ascobolo i'm pronouncing that right strawberry and more
[1:56:08.520 --> 1:56:14.520]  or and this has the fiber in it that it says in the study i just read last segment that allows
[1:56:14.520 --> 1:56:19.480]  your body to then firm in it and if you have the right bacteria on top of it which we have in
[1:56:20.520 --> 1:56:26.840]  our probiotic flora life that literally then grows the the the quote supplements that your
[1:56:26.840 --> 1:56:32.920]  body operates off of in your upper and lower intestines this particular study is on the
[1:56:32.920 --> 1:56:38.520]  lower intestine bill gates is obsessed with gut flora and they're they're they're totally investing
[1:56:38.520 --> 1:56:43.320]  in a takeover of genetically modified bacteria to save you in the future because they believe
[1:56:43.320 --> 1:56:46.840]  only the genetically modified ones will be able to save you for the modified ones that are already
[1:56:46.840 --> 1:56:50.920]  putting out in the environment you understand they're creating a system where you need them to live
[1:56:52.360 --> 1:56:56.440]  and they're trying to basically outlaw it why do you think bill gates is obsessed with me and
[1:56:56.440 --> 1:57:00.920]  finances all these tv shows and movies against me because he knows i'm on his ass but by researchers
[1:57:00.920 --> 1:57:05.720]  and folks he's controlling the weather control system he's in charge of attacking our gut
[1:57:05.720 --> 1:57:12.840]  he's in charge of pushing euthanasia enforce an oculation just look into it so gut fusion but
[1:57:14.600 --> 1:57:19.880]  something your gut doesn't make that's right in line with all of this is pqq and coq10 that
[1:57:19.880 --> 1:57:31.000]  absolutely regrows mitochondria regrows heart tissue the coq10 that's a major studies and regrows
[1:57:31.000 --> 1:57:35.560]  nerves and just does all this insane stuff research that 50 off everybody should have
[1:57:35.560 --> 1:57:41.640]  DNA force and it funds the operation in full or store.com i just this stuff is so important
[1:57:41.640 --> 1:57:44.200]  it's literally the key and i don't want you to have it
[1:57:44.200 --> 1:57:51.800]  beto roark came out dozens of times and said we're going to confiscate all your semi-automatic
[1:57:51.800 --> 1:57:57.800]  rifles and he got all the other democrats on the stage nine others to agree and said that he was a
[1:57:57.800 --> 1:58:03.560]  hero think about that now those democrats have taken all the guns and the cities they control
[1:58:03.560 --> 1:58:10.600]  their blue cities are literal crap holes covered with needles and with massive drug dealing and
[1:58:10.600 --> 1:58:16.920]  incredible levels of violent crime they know what they're doing and now the supreme courts come out
[1:58:16.920 --> 1:58:22.520]  and ruled that gun manufacturers can be sued into oblivion for what criminals do using their
[1:58:22.520 --> 1:58:26.760]  firearms my goodness ladies and gentlemen this country is under such incredible attack but
[1:58:27.400 --> 1:58:32.280]  more and more towns and cities are saying they're sanctuaries for the second amendment
[1:58:32.280 --> 1:58:36.440]  and they're going to follow the original bill of rights and constitution and they're not going to
[1:58:36.440 --> 1:58:41.720]  help in the confiscation of guns so you see a lot of these cities ignore illegal aliens well we
[1:58:41.720 --> 1:58:51.160]  could ignore all your unconstitutional laws about a month ago president trump announced
[1:58:51.160 --> 1:58:57.000]  that he was going to move his domicile from new york city to florida where he's always said he
[1:58:57.000 --> 1:59:05.000]  planned to retire to and the left got so excited they said oh he's about to resign and leave instead
[1:59:05.000 --> 1:59:11.560]  of facing impeachment and he's running to florida well now we know why the president did that he
[1:59:11.560 --> 1:59:16.920]  knew the leftist controlled appeals courts we're going to say that he had to give up his tax returns
[1:59:16.920 --> 1:59:22.920]  so they can pour over them and harass every business partner he's got they want to terrorize
[1:59:22.920 --> 1:59:29.000]  people that he's worked with and by moving his domicile from new york to florida that gets around
[1:59:29.000 --> 1:59:35.560]  the new york law they passed to get his tax returns that are supposed to be private so all
[1:59:35.560 --> 1:59:42.120]  those people out there holding their breath for the president to resign in his words we're kicking
[1:59:42.120 --> 2:00:02.040]  the deep states ass and he's never gonna resign you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:00:02.040 --> 2:00:12.600]  he aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side you're listening to alex
[2:00:12.600 --> 2:00:20.760]  jones you know i see some of the callers here like taylor in texas and then and we're gonna go to
[2:00:20.760 --> 2:00:27.080]  them after the break does trump being poison needs to go public they'll say 25th amendment he's crazy
[2:00:27.080 --> 2:00:35.480]  it's not happening what they always do you know we found the department of energy project like 20
[2:00:35.480 --> 2:00:41.560]  years ago adding barium salts loomed oxide and other things to jet fuel then it was aerosolized
[2:00:41.560 --> 2:00:45.400]  through a patent to quote protect us from global warming and we'd point out that it actually makes
[2:00:45.400 --> 2:00:50.920]  the solar radiation go through especially the ultra violent bounce back but contains more of it and
[2:00:50.920 --> 2:00:59.080]  so i said up front they're trying to warm the earth to create a crisis and weather weapons to
[2:00:59.080 --> 2:01:05.480]  devastate certain countries they don't like they said i was crazy and the cia director came out
[2:01:06.040 --> 2:01:12.600]  three years ago and said word for word what i said 20 years ago and we figured all this out we
[2:01:12.600 --> 2:01:17.560]  figured it out we know what they're doing got the whole thing figured out and then why would our
[2:01:17.560 --> 2:01:22.840]  fellow humans do this they all think they're going to become gods and merge with machines and
[2:01:22.840 --> 2:01:29.480]  silicon but they've got to get rid of humans first before they ascend that's silicon valley and i'm
[2:01:29.480 --> 2:01:33.400]  like they're creating a world government they're creating a mark of the beast they're creating a
[2:01:33.400 --> 2:01:38.520]  casual society it's all coming in and everything that they're doing is hurting us and dumbing us
[2:01:38.520 --> 2:01:46.440]  down and making us depressed and killing us wages of center death and i'm like well the bible says
[2:01:46.440 --> 2:01:51.480]  it's a fallen entity on the planet notice the media never attacks me for this because they
[2:01:51.480 --> 2:01:59.720]  know everybody instinctively knows it's true we're on a planet and we've got free will and we're
[2:01:59.720 --> 2:02:06.360]  much bigger and much more powerful than satan spiritually but we're babies and so we have
[2:02:06.360 --> 2:02:12.600]  free will and so this entity that's interdimensional is here trying to get humans that are working
[2:02:12.600 --> 2:02:18.360]  with it to build a really horrible system with the promise of immortality when our spirits already
[2:02:18.360 --> 2:02:25.640]  immortal and god created us to to literally go to heaven the heavens and be with god forever
[2:02:27.480 --> 2:02:36.200]  but we can't make it out of this pond this tadpole pond or like the caterpillar you know we're going
[2:02:36.200 --> 2:02:40.200]  into the chrysalis right now and the system knows we're going to pop out as a butterfly
[2:02:40.200 --> 2:02:49.080]  and fly off and they're really pissed folks and so forget the devil forget lay folks would call it
[2:02:49.080 --> 2:02:54.760]  you know space aliens or whatever the hell it is it's happening world government cashless
[2:02:54.760 --> 2:03:01.880]  society an attack on the very species itself and procreation and our very dna the code that
[2:03:01.880 --> 2:03:06.680]  allows us to replicate and continue on we are literally being mutated and not in a good way
[2:03:06.680 --> 2:03:16.520]  ahead of the big event and obviously most people are going to physically be destroyed by this
[2:03:18.280 --> 2:03:19.800]  what matters is the soul
[2:03:23.000 --> 2:03:27.880]  but it's the body that we now know from science does literally receive and transmit
[2:03:27.880 --> 2:03:32.600]  electrochemically that is receiving the transmission and all the poisoning and everything
[2:03:32.600 --> 2:03:37.800]  that's going on is an attempt to jam that and everyone listening innately knows that's true
[2:03:40.120 --> 2:03:44.600]  and now it's just all out the open the world government the plan to end humanity the whole thing
[2:03:47.720 --> 2:03:51.960]  by those enslaved i mean you look at the head of silicon valley you look at all those people
[2:03:51.960 --> 2:03:58.920]  those are slaves they're not running anything and they're scared because by the time you sign on to
[2:03:58.920 --> 2:04:07.000]  all this stuff you find out wow you really screwed up because the force you sign on with is really
[2:04:07.000 --> 2:04:14.680]  bad news but by the time they've committed all these sins against innocence they're damned off
[2:04:14.680 --> 2:04:20.120]  from god they're cut off and they know and so they're i guess just trying to get better seats
[2:04:20.120 --> 2:04:26.760]  in the fandom zone you imagine again being trapped with all these evil globalists but they don't
[2:04:26.760 --> 2:04:31.960]  have kids and people to feed on just all together basically an auditorium forever you imagine that
[2:04:32.920 --> 2:04:37.320]  god says here you just go build whatever you want over there so a lot of big stuff's happening
[2:04:37.320 --> 2:04:41.880]  and their system's coming down even as it's built so we'll come back from break i'll go

[2:07:14.600 --> 2:07:18.520]  i want to go to your phone calls ladies and gentlemen we've posted to info wars dot com
[2:07:18.520 --> 2:07:24.440]  in these articles the flashback to september 2017 where roger stoner and i get into the
[2:07:25.160 --> 2:07:30.520]  covert attempts to drug the president now he's been rushed to the hospital reportedly because
[2:07:30.520 --> 2:07:36.120]  his tester got very ill and they do believe that a uh some type of binary weapon or
[2:07:36.120 --> 2:07:39.480]  others exotic system had been added to the food they're not sure if trump was hit with it
[2:07:40.120 --> 2:07:45.320]  but that's your mystery pretty much solved unless our sources are lying to us and you've seen how
[2:07:45.320 --> 2:07:49.800]  good our sources are hillary clinton's having convulsions and she drives around a black ambulance
[2:07:49.800 --> 2:07:55.960]  get on it boom it gets caught on tape you know phiona hill macmasters all of them
[2:07:56.520 --> 2:08:01.800]  their sorrows operatives here's the whistleblower eric seramola and we we've broken hundreds of
[2:08:01.800 --> 2:08:07.160]  big things here and the president doesn't keep
[2:08:09.480 --> 2:08:12.840]  you know the food in the white house close to him he gets food from outside the white house
[2:08:13.400 --> 2:08:16.920]  they admittedly are doing that because he thinks they're trying to poison him well of course they are
[2:08:17.640 --> 2:08:20.440]  attorney general said in speech friday i've already played it three times today
[2:08:21.160 --> 2:08:27.640]  that the deep state the lepis are doing everything they can to sabotage and have shredded every
[2:08:27.640 --> 2:08:33.400]  system of civilization and rule of law everything that means violence as well
[2:08:35.000 --> 2:08:41.000]  economic sabotage cultural sabotage fake whistleblowers fake russia gate imprisoning his support base
[2:08:41.880 --> 2:08:45.400]  they're making their move because they know he's going to win 2020 unless there's massive
[2:08:45.400 --> 2:08:53.080]  election fraud and trump is so cut off and so surrounded what are we going to do to stop it
[2:08:53.080 --> 2:08:57.880]  ahead of the false flags that are going to try to trigger a civil war now with obama and bill
[2:08:57.880 --> 2:09:01.560]  marr saying they don't want civil war they want peace they would only do that right before a big
[2:09:01.560 --> 2:09:06.680]  triggering event so they could say oh look we just called for peace i'm telling you that was so ominous
[2:09:06.680 --> 2:09:10.280]  i covered it last night i didn't even know about this hospital thing this was kept so quiet last
[2:09:10.280 --> 2:09:15.960]  night i said something big is happening they're making a move a violent move i want to go to
[2:09:15.960 --> 2:09:23.160]  your calls now we're going to go to r a j in femur region six then everybody else that's holding
[2:09:23.160 --> 2:09:29.560]  thank you for calling from femur region six r a j go ahead yeah it's great to be speaking
[2:09:29.560 --> 2:09:36.600]  to the three world here alex yes sir erect you know i want to say first of all probably the
[2:09:36.600 --> 2:09:43.560]  best thing i've heard in five years is this increasing spirituality uh you're amping it up
[2:09:43.560 --> 2:09:49.800]  the more we talk about things like kanye and you play on air and declare things that are true
[2:09:50.840 --> 2:09:56.280]  so i'm excited about where this show has gone in the past five or six years it's amazing
[2:09:57.720 --> 2:10:01.560]  well i mean when the devil's out in the open with world government and casual societies and
[2:10:01.560 --> 2:10:05.880]  pedophiles are out in the open and satanism is out in the open and margaret the beast is out in
[2:10:05.880 --> 2:10:12.520]  the open you better get close to jesus yeah i mean you're on target you're drawing more people that
[2:10:12.520 --> 2:10:19.880]  that are awake and that are alive and so the better we can do uh you know and in our own
[2:10:19.880 --> 2:10:24.760]  areas this is the biggest thing i can offer i called in to say there's i believe there's a
[2:10:24.760 --> 2:10:32.040]  key pre-emptive action that can be taken by believers but you've got to do it in your own
[2:10:32.040 --> 2:10:39.960]  area your own your own local area and i'm femur region six and uh if if we let them know ahead
[2:10:39.960 --> 2:10:48.440]  of time if anything happens to our president that things like mortgage payments are going to go on
[2:10:48.440 --> 2:10:55.480]  hold indefinitely and it'd be a wise thing to even organize it just a shot across the bow
[2:10:55.480 --> 2:10:59.720]  no that's the strike that would actually work if because that's the big bankers have sold those
[2:10:59.720 --> 2:11:05.080]  over and over again if patriots quit paying their mortgage payments and their credit card payments
[2:11:05.080 --> 2:11:12.360]  it would really freak out the ponzi scheme that's the financial system yeah all it takes is people
[2:11:12.360 --> 2:11:17.320]  to do that i mean they can they could rotate it because you can only do it for so long and you
[2:11:17.320 --> 2:11:23.800]  don't want to get sidelined but if you know five or six people in each district each congressional
[2:11:23.800 --> 2:11:28.840]  district just told their congressman here's what's going to happen this is a warning to the deep state
[2:11:28.840 --> 2:11:34.920]  and then hold them back for 60 days i mean that that's that's going to that's going to hit the
[2:11:34.920 --> 2:11:42.440]  register hard right up front well i know this they want to remove the president have the little
[2:11:42.440 --> 2:11:47.800]  minions have a violent fight with us no no bill mar no obama all of you are going to be held
[2:11:47.800 --> 2:11:52.600]  accountable if violence kicks off and everybody knows that it's not a threat i'm just telling folks
[2:11:52.600 --> 2:11:57.320]  the way the cow ate the cabbage and uh which tells me they're getting up to the edge of the
[2:11:57.320 --> 2:12:01.320]  cliff they're getting ready to pull the trigger thanks for the call okay let's talk to jim and
[2:12:01.320 --> 2:12:08.440]  boston jim you're on the air thanks for calling hey what's going on man uh what do you think about
[2:12:08.440 --> 2:12:13.960]  the trump being rushed to the hospital saturday you know i'm not i'm not surprised and and here's
[2:12:13.960 --> 2:12:19.560]  why and i think i'm i'm shocked that that more hasn't happened because the way that i'm seeing this
[2:12:19.560 --> 2:12:25.240]  is is trump isn't doing anything preemptive or proactive that we can see anyway in order to
[2:12:25.240 --> 2:12:30.920]  support some of their efforts so as long as he sits back and watches this happen it's going to
[2:12:30.920 --> 2:12:35.720]  keep happening alex and i i think that that something needs to be done whereas the democrats
[2:12:35.720 --> 2:12:40.440]  can put a charge on somebody get them into the legal system quickly and get them convicted like
[2:12:40.440 --> 2:12:45.720]  roger stone like man of fort like general flinn but yet on the flip side nothing happened and
[2:12:45.720 --> 2:12:50.840]  here's just another example of waiting to see what they're going to do i notice they they they
[2:12:50.840 --> 2:12:57.320]  convict roger stone and then the president has to go to the hospital the next day because his
[2:12:57.320 --> 2:13:01.720]  food tester got sick reportedly and then you read all the news they're admittedly scared of poison
[2:13:01.720 --> 2:13:06.120]  and getting food secretly and people are secret service agents are dropping dead and all sorts of
[2:13:06.120 --> 2:13:09.560]  mysterious stuff and the secret service and others are telling us that of course there's
[2:13:09.560 --> 2:13:13.400]  attempts on the president's life with the deep state i mean these people are killers and look
[2:13:13.400 --> 2:13:19.000]  at how arrogant brennan is when he's on tv going thank god for the deep state we're taking trump out
[2:13:19.000 --> 2:13:24.440]  and he's just making ugly faces on c span like he's king kong what the hell happened to this country
[2:13:25.000 --> 2:13:29.720]  and these people are crazy i god bless you i appreciate the call good point jim i'm gonna
[2:13:29.720 --> 2:13:36.920]  move quick here taylor in texas you're on the air go ahead hi alex uh long time listener uh i've
[2:13:36.920 --> 2:13:41.720]  been listening to you ever since uh the charlie hodge half time show where you got canceled um
[2:13:41.720 --> 2:13:49.560]  um i just love the show uh i just want to say uh you're real god's real and the devil's real too
[2:13:49.560 --> 2:13:55.640]  and uh i just want to say if you live in a small town no matter what uh you know you're still under
[2:13:55.640 --> 2:14:01.400]  attack you know you're not safe these people are out here to kill still destroy just like the devil
[2:14:01.400 --> 2:14:09.160]  that he came to do um but also i just want to get your thoughts on uh would it be more beneficiary
[2:14:09.160 --> 2:14:17.000]  for trump to go public about the assassination they would say that it was uh insanity twenty
[2:14:17.000 --> 2:14:21.960]  fifth amendment he's paranoid they're all saying killing uh you know somebody's gotten sick but i
[2:14:21.960 --> 2:14:25.960]  think he came out with the doctors the scientists and you know showed what it was and what happened
[2:14:25.960 --> 2:14:30.760]  but you heard mike adams earlier who's a big chemist and owns a large lab that studies this
[2:14:30.760 --> 2:14:36.520]  uh food adulteration and poisoning they've got all sorts of synthetic things and biological
[2:14:36.520 --> 2:14:42.920]  things they can make that are undetectable basically okay so it they may try to spin it
[2:14:43.880 --> 2:14:50.120]  well i mean it's a good question should trump go public about this uh it doesn't radiate strength
[2:14:50.120 --> 2:14:55.240]  that's why trump probably wouldn't do it but it's up for it's up to us surrogates to do it because
[2:14:55.240 --> 2:15:00.200]  the president's not probably his place to do it i think what you're hearing on air is this fact going
[2:15:00.200 --> 2:15:08.040]  public do you ever think about that yeah that makes that makes sense okay awesome well i mean i mean
[2:15:08.040 --> 2:15:11.960]  i think the deep state would spin it go you're crazy but i think the american people know they
[2:15:11.960 --> 2:15:16.280]  want to poison the president hell we've already seen them try everything the question is what are
[2:15:16.280 --> 2:15:21.480]  they going to do next well they blow his head off like ronald reagan and or or like kennedy
[2:15:21.480 --> 2:15:27.720]  and or try to kill uh him like they did uh you know or try to kill reagan then it would blow up
[2:15:27.720 --> 2:15:31.160]  in their face i'm going to come back and get back into that statement i was about to make
[2:15:32.360 --> 2:15:36.280]  on the other side because that needs to be made properly i was kind of stumbling around there
[2:15:36.280 --> 2:15:40.200]  so i was watching the clip they were playing we're going to play ronald reagan when we come back

[2:17:57.800 --> 2:18:07.880]  thomas jefferson what is the level of tyranny that a tyrant will take humanity too how far will
[2:18:07.880 --> 2:18:14.760]  they go what's their limit and he said it is the limit to which other men and women will submit
[2:18:16.040 --> 2:18:23.880]  the answer is there is no limit to evil it is a bottomless pit we've been taught in modern
[2:18:23.880 --> 2:18:30.360]  culture and society that evil doesn't exist or that there's no free will there's no devil or the
[2:18:30.360 --> 2:18:37.400]  god but those very same people have all these rules for us about speech and how we can dress
[2:18:37.400 --> 2:18:43.640]  and where we can live and what our houses can be like they just don't want us to have any values
[2:18:43.640 --> 2:18:49.800]  so they can run over us oxford's band clapping universities the us of band 21 gun salutes for
[2:18:49.800 --> 2:18:55.960]  veterans these people are dangerous cult leaders and it's time to reject them the globalists know
[2:18:55.960 --> 2:19:01.160]  that i will never willingly give up i've said it many times i will never give in
[2:19:01.160 --> 2:19:09.160]  i will never give up but i could give out and it's very very frustrating to see them committing
[2:19:09.160 --> 2:19:16.120]  all their crimes against humanity to see evil running rampant like this and to know that most
[2:19:16.120 --> 2:19:22.280]  americans have already been silenced in cyberspace that most americans have already been shadowband
[2:19:22.280 --> 2:19:29.080]  by big tech and to know that most americans feel powerless and don't realize how much power they
[2:19:29.080 --> 2:19:35.880]  have by spreading the word about news wars dot com info wars dot com and band on video
[2:19:35.880 --> 2:19:40.280]  and that people are hungry for the truth now more than ever and then if you tell people hey
[2:19:40.280 --> 2:19:45.320]  the band truth they don't want you to have is at info wars dot com forward slash show
[2:19:45.320 --> 2:19:50.520]  and band on video so take heart folks they've had to censor everybody to show everybody down
[2:19:50.520 --> 2:19:53.800]  because the truth is powerful and they can't beat us fair and square
[2:19:53.800 --> 2:19:59.800]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:20:23.800 --> 2:20:43.400]  i am going to your phone calls ladies and gentlemen concerning the president being
[2:20:43.400 --> 2:20:48.520]  rushed to the hospital saturday getting almost no news coverage and seeing it saying oh that shows
[2:20:48.520 --> 2:20:53.720]  he's in bad health remove him 24th amendment but then our sources say there's been a bunch of
[2:20:53.720 --> 2:20:59.000]  poisoning attempts in the white house and we first broke a lot of that years ago that the president
[2:20:59.000 --> 2:21:03.640]  was concerned about being poisoned and was buying fast food from trusted sources that he would send
[2:21:03.640 --> 2:21:09.000]  out and get it trusted sources would procure it and of course all of that later came out in the
[2:21:09.000 --> 2:21:15.080]  news this is very serious reports from good sources these are real sources so that means either
[2:21:15.080 --> 2:21:20.840]  they've been given this info and and or lying to us or it's true you look at the whole climate
[2:21:20.840 --> 2:21:26.920]  and the attempts to remove trump of course it's true and the establishment is just going for
[2:21:26.920 --> 2:21:32.760]  broke corruption wise let's roll some footage of the zebruder film remember what happened in texas
[2:21:33.640 --> 2:21:41.160]  back in 1963 to kennedy there it is for tv viewers and then of course everybody knows
[2:21:41.160 --> 2:21:47.400]  what happened in 1981 when ronald reagan wasn't letting the deep state and george herbert walker
[2:21:47.400 --> 2:21:55.160]  bush run the entire show he got shot and the man that shot him was put in a mental institution and
[2:21:55.160 --> 2:22:03.000]  was recently released and his brother was best buddies with the bushes and ran major cia operations
[2:22:03.000 --> 2:22:11.480]  the father did so they're not hiding eric siramala trying to remove trump and being from the cia
[2:22:11.480 --> 2:22:17.800]  they're not hiding any of this so of course they're going to try to poison the president
[2:22:17.800 --> 2:22:24.120]  the chai coms and the cubans have been radiating our embassies in cuba and in china what do you
[2:22:24.120 --> 2:22:29.160]  think the deep state's going to do to trump we should pray for president trump you should pray
[2:22:29.160 --> 2:22:33.800]  for him for she's pray for america pray for yourselves because this is a very dangerous
[2:22:33.800 --> 2:22:39.480]  group and i'll tell you all this talk of let's not have a civil war from nancy polosi i forgot
[2:22:39.480 --> 2:22:46.440]  about her and from obama and from bill marr all last week let's tone down our rhetoric
[2:22:49.720 --> 2:22:53.080]  i said before i even knew about this with trump that means they're about to pull violence off
[2:22:53.880 --> 2:22:58.440]  false flags or assassination something because they want to be able to say oh look we called for
[2:22:58.440 --> 2:23:02.600]  reconciliation before they stayed something and blaming on us or before they make a move
[2:23:03.960 --> 2:23:09.320]  against the president people say well it'll be a civil war if they kill trump the chai
[2:23:09.320 --> 2:23:14.600]  coms are the main financiers of this now along with the e u they don't care of america's in a giant
[2:23:17.240 --> 2:23:23.160]  breakdown i mean it won't be like north versus south it'll be a breakdown of of of law and order
[2:23:23.160 --> 2:23:27.000]  and and of the stock market and a bunch of things it'll be it'll cause the new depression
[2:23:28.680 --> 2:23:33.000]  and that's what the left wants they said member bill marr let's crash the economy to stop trump
[2:23:33.000 --> 2:23:39.720]  and then the federal reserve started doing it bill marr is seen as the voice of the globalist would
[2:23:39.720 --> 2:23:44.440]  you hear something out of bill marr's mouth that means you're hearing it out of hillary clinton's
[2:23:45.000 --> 2:23:50.360]  hearing out of barack obamas tell jimmy kimmel admits he has hour-long conversations with
[2:23:50.360 --> 2:23:55.960]  democrat leaders including chuckie schumer every day he does a show they're telling him what to say
[2:23:58.840 --> 2:24:02.600]  so when they're saying let's kill republicans and let's hit them on the head and let's wipe
[2:24:02.600 --> 2:24:06.680]  them out let's take their kids let's put them in forced labor camps they've they've said all that
[2:24:09.320 --> 2:24:13.000]  that's because they're trying to warm that up but then right when they actually trigger they go
[2:24:13.000 --> 2:24:16.760]  who we want peace we want peace we didn't do any of this thinking we'll forget what they've been
[2:24:16.760 --> 2:24:27.880]  doing for three years let's go to your phone calls who's up next year let's go to eric and south
[2:24:27.880 --> 2:24:34.600]  dakota eric oh frank in australia is the next step for that eric and south dakota go ahead thank you
[2:24:34.600 --> 2:24:40.920]  sir um alec jones i want to say thank you for being a true patriot patriot thank you for pledging
[2:24:40.920 --> 2:24:46.360]  your life your fortune and your sacred honor just want to make a quick comment i think uh
[2:24:46.360 --> 2:24:52.440]  mike adams made a comment on your show a few Sundays ago when he was guest hosting for you and
[2:24:52.440 --> 2:24:58.520]  he said mr president we the people have your back if you need something you just got to let us know
[2:24:59.160 --> 2:25:04.520]  and i think that's an extremely important comment bingo i was thinking that this morning i even
[2:25:04.520 --> 2:25:09.640]  heard mike when he said it i was watching you're right he has to have the fireside chat and you
[2:25:09.640 --> 2:25:17.080]  know what maybe the last caller was right or taylor uh the caller before last maybe it is time for
[2:25:17.080 --> 2:25:20.760]  trump to tell people what's really going on behind the scenes because as much as we know can you
[2:25:20.760 --> 2:25:29.880]  imagine what else is going on yeah it's got to be pretty freaky keep going sorry no no that's
[2:25:29.880 --> 2:25:34.280]  fine i i uh don't want to take any more time away from your other callers just thank you for the
[2:25:34.280 --> 2:25:39.560]  important job that you do and and everybody there at your staff and god bless you well eric let me
[2:25:39.560 --> 2:25:46.440]  ask you this question is you're really soft-spoken you tell thoughtful person how do we get president
[2:25:46.440 --> 2:25:50.920]  trumps back i mean a lot of folks say well the shooting war starts you know we'll wipe out the
[2:25:50.920 --> 2:25:57.640]  left we don't want that we want to peacefully go out in information and and also we have to
[2:25:58.360 --> 2:26:03.240]  in civil disobedience but don't hurt anybody and and really make the the gears of the system
[2:26:03.240 --> 2:26:07.160]  grind to a halt like the caller said earlier you know don't pay your mortgages for three months
[2:26:07.160 --> 2:26:11.480]  or something there's a lot of things we can do instead of having a shooting war it's not like
[2:26:11.480 --> 2:26:16.280]  i'm scared of a shooting war it's just a shooting war is going to kill a bunch of mindless leftists
[2:26:16.280 --> 2:26:20.600]  we want to stop the globalists that are orchestrating this we want to cut the head off the snake
[2:26:20.600 --> 2:26:27.080]  how do we do that well you're of course asking the key question which is where's the line drawn
[2:26:27.080 --> 2:26:34.600]  at at what point and with what kind of a response you know do when do we finally stand up and say
[2:26:34.600 --> 2:26:40.120]  this is where the line's drawn enough is enough now we gotta take care of this uh convicted pedophiles
[2:26:40.120 --> 2:26:45.160]  going and having kids in public schools bounce on their crotches i mean just all of it the
[2:26:45.160 --> 2:26:49.400]  the national news saying let's kill trump or saying you know that trump supporters are all
[2:26:49.400 --> 2:26:54.760]  nazis physically attack them they're trying to get goons to kill us they're already physically
[2:26:54.760 --> 2:26:59.880]  attacking us it's just they've got it set up where if we start going after jeff zucker and others
[2:26:59.880 --> 2:27:04.920]  they'll call us terrorists and try to spin it the other way but i think once the violence starts
[2:27:04.920 --> 2:27:08.280]  it's going to avalanche into them and they're going to lose the whole thing but i don't want
[2:27:08.280 --> 2:27:14.520]  to go that direction i don't want jeff zucker dead i don't want hillary clinton dead i just
[2:27:14.520 --> 2:27:20.040]  want them off our backs i don't want a civil war in this country but they are pushing one
[2:27:21.320 --> 2:27:25.400]  you know i've i've thought about this an awful lot alec and i sometimes i just wonder
[2:27:26.120 --> 2:27:31.880]  if the right answer very very peacefully of course you know okay so i've heard other
[2:27:31.880 --> 2:27:37.000]  comments made about well what needs to happen is you know 50 000 patriots need to ascend on
[2:27:37.000 --> 2:27:42.520]  washington dc with the rifles or something like that oh no i don't want that well see the thing that
[2:27:42.520 --> 2:27:48.040]  is i'm wondering you know how fast they'd set us up they would definitely have somebody dead in a
[2:27:48.040 --> 2:27:52.600]  truck bomb or something a congress saying it was us we do not want and i'm not saying you're saying
[2:27:52.600 --> 2:27:59.240]  that believe me that's the deep state pushing that how about 50 000 people bring their children
[2:27:59.240 --> 2:28:05.080]  and all go confront members of congress when it's in session in their offices peacefully or um you
[2:28:05.080 --> 2:28:10.760]  know a localized approach that i've thought about is very peacefully drive to your state capital
[2:28:10.760 --> 2:28:15.800]  because that's within driving distance and your employer governor look you're our voice you need
[2:28:15.800 --> 2:28:20.440]  to call in and do something about this now i totally agree we need to see more out of the
[2:28:20.440 --> 2:28:24.760]  attorney general of texas and the governor speaking out against the globalist of the new world order
[2:28:25.480 --> 2:28:29.560]  and defending trump and saying what the deep state's doing is wrong uh we know we're seeing some of
[2:28:29.560 --> 2:28:33.160]  the state governors do that but we need to see more of that we need to see us senators doing that
[2:28:33.720 --> 2:28:38.440]  i know the senate has written letters to abc news and so is the house concerning their cover up a
[2:28:38.440 --> 2:28:44.360]  pedophile rings oh my gosh they wrote a letter i want to see hearings i want to see indictments
[2:28:44.360 --> 2:28:49.560]  i want to see it we'll be right back stay with us stay there frank i'm going right to you

[2:29:50.600 --> 2:30:00.840]  6740 Beto Rourke came out dozens of times and said we're going to confiscate all your semi-automatic
[2:30:00.840 --> 2:30:06.920]  rifles and he got all the other democrats on the stage nine others to agree and said that he was a
[2:30:06.920 --> 2:30:12.680]  hero think about that now those democrats have taken all the guns in the cities they control
[2:30:12.680 --> 2:30:19.640]  their blue cities are literal crap holes covered with needles and with massive drug dealing and
[2:30:19.640 --> 2:30:25.960]  incredible levels of violent crime they know what they're doing and now the supreme courts come out
[2:30:25.960 --> 2:30:31.560]  and ruled that gun manufacturers can be sued into oblivion for what criminals do using their
[2:30:31.560 --> 2:30:36.680]  firearms my goodness ladies and gentlemen this country's under such incredible attack but more
[2:30:36.680 --> 2:30:41.640]  and more towns and cities are saying they're sanctuaries for the second amendment and they're
[2:30:41.640 --> 2:30:46.040]  going to follow the original bill of rights and constitution and they're not going to help in the
[2:30:46.040 --> 2:30:51.240]  confiscation of guns so you see a lot of these cities ignore illegal aliens well we can ignore

[2:33:19.000 --> 2:33:26.600]  calls throughout the shower then i've got to hit the prince andrew jeffrey abstein developments that
[2:33:26.600 --> 2:33:32.200]  are massive and really threatens the whole deep state pedophile ponzi scheme empire and then
[2:33:32.200 --> 2:33:38.040]  kanye says protect your kids from being indoctrinated about hollywood in the media uh which people
[2:33:38.040 --> 2:33:42.280]  say oh you know he's a fake christian well i wish the mainline christians would fight back against
[2:33:42.280 --> 2:33:46.520]  hollywood and all that stuff because they don't anymore most churches are not like focus on the
[2:33:46.520 --> 2:33:52.760]  family and dobson used to be that they just have capitulated to the left so whether he's a christian
[2:33:52.760 --> 2:34:01.080]  or not i i think he's doing a good job on that front trump made an unannounced visit the secret
[2:34:01.080 --> 2:34:05.560]  service looked really freaked out we're told by sources that one of the food testers got really
[2:34:05.560 --> 2:34:10.360]  sick and we know the president thinks they're trying to poison him we told you that before was
[2:34:10.360 --> 2:34:16.040]  ever in the news so that's why i'm covering this and kit daniels came in there earlier and he goes
[2:34:16.040 --> 2:34:20.840]  yeah the story's gone viral it's got a you know a lot of traffic to the site right now
[2:34:21.720 --> 2:34:24.920]  and he said but some people don't even know that there is a presidential tester
[2:34:25.640 --> 2:34:30.200]  who volunteers to taste the foods to a lot of something's poisoned you can taste it too
[2:34:30.920 --> 2:34:36.600]  and and and they don't believe that so kit added to the article all these links to obama having a
[2:34:36.600 --> 2:34:41.320]  poison tester and others and how the food is brought in from special vendors and how it's
[2:34:41.320 --> 2:34:47.720]  locked up and protected of course trump's a target the biggest target in history nobody
[2:34:47.720 --> 2:34:52.680]  has ever had people out trying to kill him like donald john trump i mean give me a break
[2:34:55.320 --> 2:35:00.840]  it's fine to question our sources even though we have a great track record but to say there's not
[2:35:00.840 --> 2:35:08.040]  testers is just amazing yes there are testers and i'm not going to go back over all the articles
[2:35:08.040 --> 2:35:17.480]  i covered the first two hours in it nauseam but it's a fact that they have these testers and
[2:35:17.480 --> 2:35:21.880]  those are linked to the info wars dot com article but they definitely don't want this story out
[2:35:23.080 --> 2:35:29.560]  you know we had the question was well well why isn't trump coming out and saying he thinks they
[2:35:29.560 --> 2:35:35.000]  were poisoned because it's not all 100 confirmed they'll say he's crazy 25th amendment so they
[2:35:35.000 --> 2:35:38.520]  do it through surrogates obviously that's why we were contacted
[2:35:42.120 --> 2:35:45.560]  why do you think the secret service came to us with the news that hillary was having convulsions
[2:35:45.560 --> 2:35:50.280]  had a black ambulance because the rest of the news knew about it and no one would cover it because
[2:35:50.280 --> 2:35:56.200]  they were running interference for her via donald brazil we didn't catch her collapsing
[2:35:56.200 --> 2:36:04.360]  something someone did in new york city and just as we said she had a convulsion
[2:36:04.360 --> 2:36:07.080]  and fell on her face into the black ambulance
[2:36:09.480 --> 2:36:17.400]  so this is from white house sources i mean hell i and you know i i'm not bragging about white
[2:36:17.400 --> 2:36:20.840]  house sources you know about them it's why they want to shut us down because they know that we
[2:36:20.840 --> 2:36:27.400]  get info to the white house they get us info not the bad guys the good guys on the inside
[2:36:27.640 --> 2:36:31.400]  there's so many examples of it and it's very dangerous
[2:36:34.280 --> 2:36:37.080]  and we get a lot less contact from the white house than we used to
[2:36:37.720 --> 2:36:42.920]  because the system really goes after anybody that gives us information because they know we'll put
[2:36:42.920 --> 2:36:49.880]  it out and we've said that's from white house sources is it accurate probably had they been
[2:36:49.880 --> 2:36:54.920]  accurate in the past yes all i know is they're saying kill him everywhere removing there's
[2:36:54.920 --> 2:37:00.200]  ongoing coups happening the attorney general says that they have tried everything to sabotage him
[2:37:00.200 --> 2:37:08.280]  everything they kept saying everything and they've shredded every norm of the rule of law every norm
[2:37:09.080 --> 2:37:13.480]  well the rule of law says you don't kill people without convicting them so the attorney general
[2:37:13.480 --> 2:37:17.400]  told you we're in a civil war i don't know why the indictments have him a gun because
[2:37:17.400 --> 2:37:20.120]  right now we're all just getting punched one way from the globalist
[2:37:21.960 --> 2:37:26.760]  like while i take these calls will you guys roll the clip of brennan at the on c span
[2:37:28.040 --> 2:37:33.240]  in slow motion if you can or just over and over again while they say the deep state thank god the
[2:37:33.240 --> 2:37:37.000]  deep state is the intelligence agencies that are going to take this guy out it turns out
[2:37:37.880 --> 2:37:42.120]  sir marilla cia remella worked directly for him
[2:37:42.120 --> 2:37:48.680]  and so the other former cia director mcglacklin rags about it bread and leans forward into the
[2:37:48.680 --> 2:37:53.880]  camera and makes a satanic gremlin face and there's just all a bunch of thugs and punks
[2:37:55.320 --> 2:38:00.040]  that literally hate this country and are squatting on top of america and i am so sick of them i'm
[2:38:00.040 --> 2:38:04.600]  going to get to all these callers let's go to frank in australia frank thanks for calling
[2:38:04.600 --> 2:38:08.040]  again i have a tendency to just look at the number and see who's been holding the longest
[2:38:08.040 --> 2:38:12.040]  and i miss when somebody's calling from the other side of the planet uh frank thank you
[2:38:12.040 --> 2:38:19.400]  for calling and uh what's your view on all the situation oh well my view on this situation
[2:38:19.400 --> 2:38:26.440]  i've been watching you for years alex and every year it just gets worse and worse
[2:38:30.680 --> 2:38:32.520]  just getting to the point where they
[2:38:32.520 --> 2:38:43.560]  have locked up or just stone for no reason then he
[2:38:49.080 --> 2:38:50.520]  what do you think the president should do
[2:38:55.080 --> 2:38:56.680]  yeah i lost that call from australia
[2:38:56.680 --> 2:39:03.640]  and his question was i saw it there how far are they going to go and and what i mean i agree
[2:39:03.640 --> 2:39:10.760]  that's the sickening feeling here is that an internationally funded group of criminals that's
[2:39:10.760 --> 2:39:16.920]  brainwashed a large part of the public is literally engaged in open criminal activity bullying fraud
[2:39:18.120 --> 2:39:19.480]  and they're coming for everybody
[2:39:19.480 --> 2:39:27.240]  and now they're saying let's be friends you know what did the people in the cell next to
[2:39:27.880 --> 2:39:32.760]  ebbstein say they turn the lights off turn the cameras off at the regular jail guards leave
[2:39:32.760 --> 2:39:38.200]  two hours early special guards that never works in the building came in ebbstein starts screaming
[2:39:39.720 --> 2:39:42.600]  there's a scuffle for about a minute then they start saying breathe
[2:39:42.600 --> 2:39:49.960]  breathe jeffrey breathe that's what you do while you're killing somebody it's a joke and
[2:39:49.960 --> 2:39:55.400]  that's what obama and and and all of them are saying breathe breathe we don't want war we don't
[2:39:55.400 --> 2:40:02.040]  want violence the president goes to the hospital breathe jeffrey breathe
[2:40:04.680 --> 2:40:09.800]  that's the sick joke don't run we are your friends this is not an assault
[2:40:09.800 --> 2:40:15.240]  and none of them have ever gotten in trouble so they think there's no end i mean they got open
[2:40:15.240 --> 2:40:20.440]  pedophilia on tv with our kids almost all of washington on the democrat side now admit their
[2:40:20.440 --> 2:40:25.640]  pedophiles and represent pedophiles adam schiff all around him turns out you know his doctor

[2:41:05.880 --> 2:41:09.720]  satanic than jack nichols and trying to act satanic and every photo of him is him going
[2:41:14.040 --> 2:41:21.480]  i mean it's just like flaming loons man with crazy inbred millionaires running everything totally
[2:41:21.480 --> 2:41:32.840]  psychotic and stelter says abc's doing good they should cover up the pedophilia because he knows

[2:41:51.320 --> 2:41:56.280]  a bunch of this news there's so much of it there's so much i plan so much for the show and then
[2:41:56.280 --> 2:42:00.920]  there's usually some big development like roger on friday and now this over the weekend and it just
[2:42:00.920 --> 2:42:06.520]  makes my head spin please don't forget that we have the black friday sales now beginning and we've
[2:42:06.520 --> 2:42:11.880]  got 50 off dna force plus with free shipping double patriot points you're not going to find coq 10
[2:42:11.880 --> 2:42:18.840]  and pqq of this quality and this strength with this synergistic blend of other naturally occurring
[2:42:18.840 --> 2:42:26.840]  compounds that help deliver the pqq and the coq 10 so it's all there in the dna force plus
[2:42:26.840 --> 2:42:31.880]  because everyone even young people should be taking it it can repair dna it can repair the
[2:42:31.880 --> 2:42:37.720]  mitochondria uh the engines of the cell it can make your telomeres last longer it can regrow
[2:42:37.720 --> 2:42:41.960]  nerves it can regrow heart tissue in the studies you can make all the claims about pqq go your
[2:42:41.960 --> 2:42:47.400]  fingers as a fact info war store dot com everybody should be taking this every day when you go to
[2:42:47.400 --> 2:42:52.040]  bed at night to rejuvenate your body and then it funds the info war a win-win dna force plus
[2:42:52.040 --> 2:42:59.960]  us the globalists know that i will never willingly give up i've said it many times i will never give
[2:42:59.960 --> 2:43:08.120]  in i will never give up but i could give out and it's very very frustrating to see them committing
[2:43:08.120 --> 2:43:15.160]  all their crimes against humanity to see evil running rampant like this and to know that most
[2:43:15.160 --> 2:43:21.240]  americans have already been silenced in cyberspace that most americans have already been shadowband
[2:43:21.240 --> 2:43:28.040]  by big tech and to know that most americans feel powerless and don't realize how much power they
[2:43:28.040 --> 2:43:34.840]  have by spreading the word about news wars dot com info wars dot com and band on video
[2:43:34.840 --> 2:43:39.240]  and that people are hungry for the truth now more than ever and then if you tell people hey
[2:43:39.240 --> 2:43:44.680]  the band truth they don't want you to have is at info wars dot com for its last show in band
[2:43:44.680 --> 2:43:49.960]  on video so take heart folks they've had to censor everybody to show everybody down because the
[2:43:49.960 --> 2:43:56.360]  truth is powerful and they can't beat us fair and square i've made a lot of predictions that have
[2:43:56.360 --> 2:44:02.440]  come true but i'm here to tell you that most of those really weren't predictions that came out of a
[2:44:02.440 --> 2:44:08.520]  crystal ball i could see where the globalists were going i could see what their in-game agenda was
[2:44:08.520 --> 2:44:14.040]  what their goal was and i knew that when they were setting us up to be deplatformed that they were
[2:44:14.040 --> 2:44:21.720]  really setting the precedent to take everybody off air to to silence everyone to ban words and
[2:44:21.720 --> 2:44:28.280]  names and information on fake whistleblowers so that their false narratives couldn't be opposed
[2:44:28.280 --> 2:44:34.840]  but the globalists really feared was independent media and platforms in the future it was the
[2:44:34.840 --> 2:44:41.240]  model of info wars as much as the information that had to be silenced because they need total
[2:44:41.240 --> 2:44:46.040]  information dominance for their outrageous lies and the evil they're pushing to succeed and that's
[2:44:46.040 --> 2:44:51.000]  why keeping info wars on the air is now more imperative and more vital than ever
[2:44:54.920 --> 2:45:01.800]  there's a famous quote by marine court general in the korean war when three million chai comms had
[2:45:01.800 --> 2:45:09.240]  flooded across the border and surrounded the marines more than 50 to 1 some estimates have it
[2:45:09.240 --> 2:45:14.440]  but the point is they were outnumbered and the general was told general were completely surrounded
[2:45:14.440 --> 2:45:22.200]  he said good we can attack in all directions well that's the point that info wars has reached
[2:45:22.760 --> 2:45:27.560]  and it really is epic it really is biblical and we wouldn't have gone this far without all your
[2:45:27.560 --> 2:45:35.320]  support but it's going to become more critical than ever as the censorship becomes complete
[2:45:35.320 --> 2:45:40.200]  and it's not just americans but folks all over the world are completely silenced when it comes to
[2:45:40.200 --> 2:45:46.440]  speak in the name of a cia fake whistleblower or exposing a pedophile or speaking out against
[2:45:46.440 --> 2:45:52.360]  dangerous vaccines because by info wars having its own platform that checkmates the globalist
[2:45:55.800 --> 2:46:02.600]  a question was once posed to thomas jefferson what is the level of tyranny
[2:46:02.600 --> 2:46:10.040]  that a tyrant will take humanity to how far will they go what's their limit and he said it is the
[2:46:10.040 --> 2:46:19.960]  limit to which other men and women will submit the answer is there is no limit to evil it is a
[2:46:19.960 --> 2:46:26.680]  bottomless pit we've been taught in modern culture and society that evil doesn't exist
[2:46:26.680 --> 2:46:32.680]  or that there is no free will there's no devil or the god but those very same people have all
[2:46:32.680 --> 2:46:39.880]  these rules for us about speech and how we can dress and where we can live and what our houses
[2:46:39.880 --> 2:46:46.280]  can be like they just don't want us to have any values so they can run over us oxford's band
[2:46:46.280 --> 2:46:52.200]  clapping universities the u.s of band 21 gun salutes for veterans these people are dangerous cult
[2:46:52.200 --> 2:47:08.120]  leaders and it's time to reject them you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:47:08.120 --> 2:47:23.480]  welcome back i'm alex jones your host starting at the beginning of the next hour after we take
[2:47:23.480 --> 2:47:30.360]  some more calls i'm going to get into prince andrew and i literally just had somebody in
[2:47:30.360 --> 2:47:35.240]  the hall during the break say hey you have a covered uh adam schiff and the doctor he works
[2:47:35.240 --> 2:47:42.120]  with who works for mbc news being arrested for reportedly propositioning sex with his next door
[2:47:42.120 --> 2:47:47.240]  neighbor's nine-year-old and the guy lives in thailand half the year well that's in my stack
[2:47:48.200 --> 2:47:58.040]  and it's literally just all these guys that's the club you you don't get in the club now in hollywood
[2:47:58.040 --> 2:48:07.080]  unless you're a pedophile and we got a bunch of stuff dealing with the pope and the guy he had
[2:48:07.080 --> 2:48:12.840]  running the investigation and the deputy pope cardinal pel convicted of trafficking in hundreds
[2:48:12.840 --> 2:48:18.600]  of little boys some of which ended up dead little boys you're like well what's going on
[2:48:18.600 --> 2:48:23.800]  there aren't that many pedophiles in real life but there are when it comes to taking over churches
[2:48:23.800 --> 2:48:27.880]  taking over schools taking over power
[2:48:31.560 --> 2:48:38.120]  and so look at quote royalty royalty there's much a scum bunch of pedophiles because it's
[2:48:38.120 --> 2:48:43.720]  about their selfishness and what they want and doing evil and getting away from god because
[2:48:43.720 --> 2:48:52.840]  if you'll hurt children you'll do anything that's all it's an initiation and the world's waking up
[2:48:52.840 --> 2:48:58.520]  to the fact that pedophiles running something i told you decades ago let's go to your phone calls
[2:49:00.600 --> 2:49:03.000]  okay who's been holding longest here
[2:49:05.400 --> 2:49:12.760]  he went seattle than pete in seattle you you're on the air welcome hey do you remember when hillary
[2:49:12.760 --> 2:49:20.040]  was the first lady yes and what was her focus while she was in there
[2:49:20.040 --> 2:49:28.040]  care it was a bunch of stuff care it was it was health care and it was uh it was a crime and it was
[2:49:28.040 --> 2:49:34.760]  children and she was shut down i guess by the republican establishment i don't know what it was
[2:49:34.760 --> 2:49:39.880]  like she was trying to take yes they killed her attempt to take over health care there was a book
[2:49:39.880 --> 2:49:44.440]  published by a secret service agent that was serving on a clinton's and the aldrich i believe
[2:49:44.440 --> 2:49:49.400]  it was he goes into that in pretty good detail he might want to find that we've had him on before
[2:49:49.400 --> 2:49:54.600]  i've had him on probably five or six times yeah he talked about how what they had mouths
[2:49:54.600 --> 2:50:04.680]  say tongue christmas ornaments and crack pipes yeah yeah history well bill clinton as far as i know
[2:50:04.680 --> 2:50:11.320]  during the vietnam war spent his days in in moscow so he came over here and got himself
[2:50:11.320 --> 2:50:17.880]  elected because of perot supposedly third party right took it away from bush senior and then
[2:50:17.880 --> 2:50:26.600]  and his it seemed to me his total uh behind the scenes or undercurrent agenda was to make a mockery
[2:50:26.600 --> 2:50:32.520]  of american jurisprudence and that was an era that i like to typify what was that's right that's
[2:50:32.520 --> 2:50:36.040]  when they got us used to the corruption and them just doing whatever they wanted to you're absolutely
[2:50:36.040 --> 2:50:45.480]  right yeah there's a another dot that i wanted to connect i think it was in 2004 uh and i don't
[2:50:45.480 --> 2:50:51.160]  know if it was on abc or mbc whoever wolf blitzer worked for at the time when the colors of the
[2:50:51.160 --> 2:50:58.520]  elephant and the donkey changed and there was absolutely no warning or absolutely no explanation
[2:50:59.320 --> 2:51:04.920]  but for the longest time the donkey was red and the elephant was blue and all of a sudden
[2:51:04.920 --> 2:51:10.280]  banned during that bush junior election i think it was in 2004 somewhere around there was after
[2:51:10.280 --> 2:51:16.120]  9 11 all of a sudden the icon colors switched on i remember all that i was just thinking about the
[2:51:16.120 --> 2:51:21.480]  other day why do you think they did that exactly because they didn't want the donkey associated
[2:51:21.480 --> 2:51:28.920]  with red and you don't hear people about it not a people about it came and went like it was and
[2:51:28.920 --> 2:51:35.320]  this seems to be an agenda or a typical mo of the left well they also fired all the newscasters on
[2:51:35.320 --> 2:51:41.800]  every major channel right before 9 11 it was that they were supposed to be a new era really good
[2:51:41.800 --> 2:51:46.600]  points that's some of the sophisticated stuff that i you know research i'm trying to figure
[2:51:46.600 --> 2:51:49.800]  out exactly why they did all that god bless you wow what a great caller i could talk to them for
[2:51:49.800 --> 2:51:54.280]  10 hours but we got to go to the next people uh let's go to peat in seattle peat you're on the
[2:51:54.280 --> 2:52:00.280]  air go ahead alex what i would love to see is you toasting roger stone with a glass of champagne
[2:52:00.280 --> 2:52:05.720]  next week the way to inspire courage is to demonstrate courage you do it all the time every
[2:52:05.720 --> 2:52:12.440]  time you bullhorn hillary i feel a wave of energy if trump wants to energize the base and stick this
[2:52:12.440 --> 2:52:19.400]  attack on him back in their face he'll pardon roger tomorrow morning i agree with you and you
[2:52:19.400 --> 2:52:23.000]  know that they said we're making our move we want trump out and then their their their impeachment
[2:52:23.000 --> 2:52:29.080]  thing fell apart so now he's rushed to the hospital and we're told that the food was poisoned uh and
[2:52:29.080 --> 2:52:33.880]  that it got the taster but not him uh and and that's what we're told i mean that's then i talked to
[2:52:33.880 --> 2:52:38.360]  my sources they said yeah that's all over the white house and then i was told but be careful
[2:52:38.360 --> 2:52:42.040]  how much you say don't give away who said it but i don't know how you give away who said it the whole
[2:52:42.040 --> 2:52:46.120]  damn white house is a buzz with this and if you want to hit the chai comms the way to do it is
[2:52:46.120 --> 2:52:51.960]  require that all pharmaceuticals say made in china if any component of the pharmaceutical is made in
[2:52:51.960 --> 2:52:59.400]  china i've seen numbers of 90 of the vaccines are made there and something like 70 of every other
[2:52:59.400 --> 2:53:05.000]  drug is either made there or the main component alex the way you demonstrate moral courage is an
[2:53:05.000 --> 2:53:10.040]  inspiration to the country and trump can do the same thing by pardoning roger roger's a good and
[2:53:10.040 --> 2:53:16.040]  loyal man you want to inspire loyalty show loyalty you're absolutely right i mean he let you know
[2:53:16.040 --> 2:53:21.160]  our pio and the submariner and some of these guys charge the war crimes that's that's fine that's
[2:53:21.160 --> 2:53:25.480]  the president's prerogative and and i you know i pushed him on on some of those uh like the
[2:53:25.480 --> 2:53:31.160]  submariner and and our pio but i mean roger's done nothing wrong these are all process crimes
[2:53:31.160 --> 2:53:35.560]  and then you researched that he was railroaded absolutely thank you well i think that's really
[2:53:35.560 --> 2:53:41.000]  my job is to show moral courage you know when i'm going bullhorn hillary and people confront her
[2:53:41.000 --> 2:53:45.480]  face to face inside the building she takes it as if i orchestrated that when i really didn't the
[2:53:45.480 --> 2:53:49.480]  listener just came out there but that's fine um people say man don't you know she'll kill you
[2:53:49.480 --> 2:53:55.240]  like i'm stupid uh no i i know that but you just got to go all the way i mean i'm trying to figure
[2:53:55.240 --> 2:54:01.880]  out ways to get more in hillary's face if i had 300 000 extra like i did three years ago i paid
[2:54:01.880 --> 2:54:07.320]  people a thousand to five thousand dollars a piece that got mil clinton hillary's face and said
[2:54:07.320 --> 2:54:11.560]  hillary covered up for bill's rapes and bill clinton's rape is because he settled three rape cases
[2:54:12.840 --> 2:54:17.560]  and uh you know i got told through the justice department that they were trying to get me indicted
[2:54:17.560 --> 2:54:24.200]  then and the nancy polosi's daughter filed a fake report that i deathreaded her which i didn't
[2:54:24.200 --> 2:54:31.160]  now you see with the news all the time saying arrest me but uh you know i really feel guilty
[2:54:31.160 --> 2:54:35.960]  that i'm not doing it enough i mean these people are evil and i'm just up here talking about them
[2:54:35.960 --> 2:54:40.440]  all that the least i could do is get in their face personally but i'm not worried about me man
[2:54:40.440 --> 2:54:45.800]  i'm really worried about everybody i mean like we're all dead already folks the gmo the vaccines
[2:54:45.800 --> 2:54:54.200]  the work the iq is dropping the life expectancy is dropping the infertility is exploding the cancer
[2:54:54.200 --> 2:54:58.680]  is exploding the neurological disorders are exploding they're murdering us
[2:55:01.080 --> 2:55:08.040]  ahead of this thing they say they're building this ai god this this beast whose image will be worshiped
[2:55:08.040 --> 2:55:15.720]  simultaneously worldwide by all peoples how could people know that two thousand years ago
[2:55:15.720 --> 2:55:21.960]  when john the rebelator on the ala patmos has this multi-day vision and sees all of this happening
[2:55:21.960 --> 2:55:27.640]  he was shown so that we'd have a warning because god gave us free will but also cheat sheets
[2:55:29.240 --> 2:55:34.200]  so that we can make the right decisions and not follow that history exactly we can have a chance
[2:55:34.200 --> 2:55:42.040]  to have an alternate future if we follow what god said but right now it's going exactly down the bad
[2:55:42.040 --> 2:55:47.240]  scenario and you know we deserve it folks all the bad things we've done to the unborn and everything
[2:55:47.240 --> 2:55:52.920]  it's going to be way worse than you can even imagine and all these all these rich men it says
[2:55:52.920 --> 2:56:00.840]  will hide under the earth in caves trying to kill themselves but they won't die wow that's a
[2:56:00.840 --> 2:56:06.200]  wow like zombies i mean read the bible it's pretty scary stuff and then when you see it all happening
[2:56:06.840 --> 2:56:11.240]  and you find out the globalist aren't atheists they're devil worshipers and they believe lucifer
[2:56:11.240 --> 2:56:17.000]  is god and that they believe they're about to be given eternal life once they kill the majority of
[2:56:17.000 --> 2:56:22.520]  us that they've been promised that we're going to go to break i'm going to go to robert and then

[2:58:06.200 --> 2:58:11.080]  we know why the president did that he knew the leftist controlled appeals courts were going to
[2:58:11.080 --> 2:58:16.280]  say that he had to give up his tax returns so they can pour over them and harass every business
[2:58:16.280 --> 2:58:23.560]  partner he's got they want to terrorize people that he's worked with and by moving his domicile
[2:58:23.560 --> 2:58:29.880]  from new york to florida that gets around the new york law they passed to get his tax returns

[3:00:53.320 --> 3:00:56.680]  gonna do that okay let's go back to your great calls here a lot of amazing calls really have been
[3:00:56.680 --> 3:01:01.160]  incredible the points they bring up i wouldn't have thought of like shouldn't trump go public with it
[3:01:02.680 --> 3:01:05.960]  conventional wisdom is don't it makes you sound weak but you know damn it it's the truth
[3:01:05.960 --> 3:01:12.760]  uh let's go ahead and uh talk to robert in north carolina robert thanks for calling
[3:01:14.200 --> 3:01:19.000]  hey alex thanks for having me on i just want to say i have a couple quick points and i just
[3:01:19.000 --> 3:01:23.240]  want to say that we have your back if anything happens i don't want to live on this planet
[3:01:23.240 --> 3:01:29.160]  without you here um one quick point angel has fallen is a new movie that just came out the name
[3:01:29.160 --> 3:01:34.360]  um of the president is us president alan trumbull when they call his name it sounds like they're
[3:01:34.360 --> 3:01:40.920]  saying president trump um and it's coincidence that you know it's a assassination attempt don't
[3:01:40.920 --> 3:01:46.200]  they try to kill him with drones yeah they do they try to kill him with drones yeah i saw i saw the
[3:01:46.200 --> 3:01:51.480]  ad so that's like a remake of olympus has fallen right i haven't seen it but yeah yeah i saw that
[3:01:51.480 --> 3:01:56.840]  that he's president trumple our trumble i mean exactly because they're into they're into the
[3:01:56.840 --> 3:02:01.240]  occult not the people that are in the movie but the actual globalists they they call it lesser
[3:02:01.240 --> 3:02:06.360]  magic it's alex your crawly stuff they believe that if they have something similar to it and tell
[3:02:06.360 --> 3:02:11.720]  you beforehand that it makes it a better chance of happening metaphysically it's like oprah wimphrey
[3:02:11.720 --> 3:02:17.000]  secret stuff it's it's voodoo right the devil's agreement with god is that and he can't do anything
[3:02:17.000 --> 3:02:22.920]  to us unless he he he tells us to he tells us about it my people were parish for lack of knowledge
[3:02:23.720 --> 3:02:30.040]  second point um i believe you said something about taking the uh head off the snake i believe
[3:02:30.040 --> 3:02:35.080]  the head of the snake here in the united states is going to be barack obama and i believe that
[3:02:35.080 --> 3:02:41.320]  trump needs to use the military and have a military tribunal to go after barack for treason
[3:02:41.320 --> 3:02:48.040]  by the way robert i mean i say thank god i take calls i'm taking more you notice because i've always
[3:02:48.040 --> 3:02:52.360]  studied this and thought i need to go after obama because i love to bash hillary because i hate her
[3:02:52.360 --> 3:02:57.720]  guts so much uh i mean she makes my skin crawl obamas doesn't and i'm not saying i like him he
[3:02:57.720 --> 3:03:01.960]  just doesn't make my skin crawl hillary makes my skin crawl she looks so demonic he's just a smug
[3:03:01.960 --> 3:03:08.200]  demon but literally he is the one running it from dc i mean we talk about brennan clapper it's obama
[3:03:08.200 --> 3:03:13.880]  obama is is high powered and and you're right he's haunt showing a lot of this crap and notice
[3:03:13.880 --> 3:03:18.440]  he always stays out of it he keeps his head down if you notice that yeah everybody else are just
[3:03:18.440 --> 3:03:23.560]  legs of the hydra and we're wrestling with all the the octopus legs and even if we cut one leg off
[3:03:23.560 --> 3:03:27.400]  another leg is going to grow back there's no way we're going to be able to take this octopus this
[3:03:27.400 --> 3:03:33.000]  hydra down unless we go after barak and if you i was in the reason why i this came to me was
[3:03:33.000 --> 3:03:37.320]  because i was reading revelation and i saw the word devil and i said well let me let me get the
[3:03:37.320 --> 3:03:43.880]  Hebrew translation of devil when i went to the Hebrew translation of devil it it was barak and
[3:03:43.880 --> 3:03:49.640]  so then i looked up what does barak mean i mean the definitions of barak wait excuse me the Hebrew
[3:03:49.640 --> 3:04:00.280]  word for devil is barak yes but well the definition of the uh of devil in revelations in revelations
[3:04:00.280 --> 3:04:08.120]  21 that i was reading when i looked up the Hebrew translation of it it it's root of that translation
[3:04:08.120 --> 3:04:13.800]  the root name for the Hebrew translation is barak okay i'm not doubting you that's amazing
[3:04:13.800 --> 3:04:17.960]  just just tell me the tell me the translation in revelation what name so i can look at the
[3:04:17.960 --> 3:04:23.880]  translation myself shit i gotta i gotta go sorry but it's okay listen very interesting
[3:04:24.840 --> 3:04:28.760]  but you're right about that whole tv show that movie thank you robert i'll look into that
[3:04:29.880 --> 3:04:34.760]  we're gonna take more calls here i've gotta hit this pedophile news because it's better than
[3:04:34.760 --> 3:04:39.400]  pedophile news is we're gonna bring down this whole system this is such a crazy time so remember
[3:04:39.400 --> 3:04:43.560]  there's not just evil in the universe there's also going to be a huge counteraction to everything
[3:04:43.560 --> 3:04:48.360]  that evil does we're at the big huge historical crossroads right now stay with us
[3:04:52.840 --> 3:04:57.800]  in full wars life has done it again with undoubtedly our biggest breakthrough yet

[3:05:44.600 --> 3:05:50.840]  low as we can go because it's very very expensive to produce get yours today at info wars life dot com
[3:05:57.320 --> 3:06:01.080]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones
[3:06:03.320 --> 3:06:07.080]  all right i want to hit a few final news pieces and then we're gonna hit a few final calls
[3:06:07.080 --> 3:06:12.760]  and then i'm going to be back on the war room today three to six p.m part of that at least with
[3:06:12.760 --> 3:06:19.720]  oanshroyer because of the clear evidence that the president was sent to the hospital for emergency
[3:06:19.720 --> 3:06:25.480]  testing to see if he had been poisoned like the one of the testers that's all in a big article
[3:06:25.480 --> 3:06:30.200]  at info wars dot com that's going to be continually updated throughout the day uh so
[3:06:30.200 --> 3:06:38.680]  so just that's going to be unfolding i did a lot of research when we came out with dna force
[3:06:38.680 --> 3:06:45.320]  plus i don't know five plus years ago now was dna force now it's dna force plus because we did a
[3:06:45.320 --> 3:06:50.680]  new contract or new company signed a two-year contract got a better deal made it stronger made
[3:06:50.680 --> 3:06:55.000]  it cheaper for us to sell it to you so it's called plus the new formula but that's been out two years
[3:06:55.960 --> 3:06:59.960]  and so i was getting ready to rebrand it and by that i mean talk about why it's great not just
[3:06:59.960 --> 3:07:04.920]  say hey buy it it supports the broadcast and i was re-researching what coq 10 and pqq and the other
[3:07:04.920 --> 3:07:11.000]  things that it do and it was just major studies that coq 10 if it's the right type can regrow
[3:07:11.000 --> 3:07:20.600]  heart tissue that dies in a heart attack pqq documented making telomeres last longer and
[3:07:20.600 --> 3:07:27.160]  regrowing cells in the brain i mean you've got to go read this is mainline universities
[3:07:27.160 --> 3:07:34.280]  these all this this is crazy and then ours is such a good formula at way way lower prices
[3:07:34.280 --> 3:07:39.400]  are going to find anywhere else it's not synthetic stuff that doesn't work info or store.com i just
[3:07:39.400 --> 3:07:45.880]  thought i'm going to really push dna force plus hard because it's the product along with x2 that
[3:07:45.880 --> 3:07:51.000]  and x3 that everybody should have i mean it's just everybody deserves this and i've been religiously
[3:07:51.000 --> 3:07:55.960]  taking it again for about three four months and everybody says you look healthier you've lost

[3:08:08.360 --> 3:08:11.960]  changing my life because i get in the cycle of take them for a while then forget to take them and
[3:08:11.960 --> 3:08:16.440]  then they just really work and then it funds the operation so get your dna force plus today

[3:08:59.160 --> 3:09:03.960]  Bethesda and i'm telling you folks these are real sources telling us this but uh that's
[3:09:03.960 --> 3:09:08.040]  important because i want this to break and become a big story so everybody realizes how serious this
[3:09:08.040 --> 3:09:15.400]  is what intel have you learned tom so alex my source is a person who works extensively in dc
[3:09:15.400 --> 3:09:21.640]  with a lot of political candidates and they have contacts with the few there are a few good uh
[3:09:21.640 --> 3:09:26.760]  patriots left in the white house uh believe it or not and they have confirmed that yes
[3:09:26.760 --> 3:09:32.920]  president trump and his motorcade were rushed to the hospital over the weekend due to a food
[3:09:32.920 --> 3:09:39.400]  poisoning scare that they believe was malicious and my source was unable to go quite as far as
[3:09:39.400 --> 3:09:45.960]  yours did i could not get the information that the food tester did indeed have a case of food poisoning
[3:09:45.960 --> 3:09:53.000]  that was uh done intentionally however it was absolutely from my understanding from my source
[3:09:53.000 --> 3:09:59.000]  the trip was unscheduled the trip was due to a person the food tester becoming horribly ill
[3:09:59.000 --> 3:10:06.120]  from immediate food poisoning uh hours after they ate and president trump fortunately appears to be
[3:10:06.120 --> 3:10:11.720]  fine but alex i just kind of follows a pattern of course roger stone was reportedly poisoned
[3:10:11.720 --> 3:10:17.800]  two years ago president trump said back on the campaign trail in 2016 that part of the reason
[3:10:17.800 --> 3:10:22.280]  why he eats so much fast food there's the photos of him eating mcdonald's kentucky fried chicken
[3:10:22.280 --> 3:10:28.280]  you name it it's because he fears food poisoning and so i think that this is a very real threat i
[3:10:28.280 --> 3:10:35.160]  think that the timing is just about on the nose and i hope that people in the white house in fact i
[3:10:35.160 --> 3:10:39.960]  know that they are at a heightened security level when it comes to anything and anybody who goes around
[3:10:39.960 --> 3:10:46.760]  the president well let me tell you i started getting calls last night but i went to bed earlier like
[3:10:46.760 --> 3:10:53.880]  nine and this morning my phone was blowing up you know why aren't you covering this you know don't
[3:10:53.880 --> 3:11:00.280]  you know don't you know that and i could tell you the people i've talked to are really concerned
[3:11:00.280 --> 3:11:04.680]  and they said and then i i made some more calls and they said of course that's what happened and
[3:11:04.680 --> 3:11:09.320]  yes everybody knows it and there's been a lot of attempts reportedly on him and they said look at
[3:11:09.320 --> 3:11:16.040]  the secret service guy who 44 years old collapsed and died uh it was right on his detail uh in scotland
[3:11:16.040 --> 3:11:21.720]  last year and so reportedly it's it's it's really circled the wagons time here and i'm really
[3:11:23.240 --> 3:11:28.840]  hoping that trump can get the justice department to move against the deep state for the crimes
[3:11:28.840 --> 3:11:31.800]  because the attorney general says they're doing everything they can to overthrow the president
[3:11:32.360 --> 3:11:38.440]  and sabotage the executive branch in lawful order well that's illegal so the fact is they're
[3:11:38.440 --> 3:11:43.000]  admitting that there's crimes are going on but that no one will act that is encouraging the
[3:11:43.000 --> 3:11:49.800]  globalists to keep doing this we have to stop them tom i agree alex i think that this is kind of to
[3:11:49.800 --> 3:11:54.680]  be seen as they shot across the bow i mean it seems like anytime the president gets close to acting
[3:11:54.680 --> 3:11:59.080]  who knows what really provoked this as i was trying to get out of my source that they did not know or
[3:11:59.080 --> 3:12:05.800]  would not tell me was are you planning to pardon roger stone are they planning to finally declassify
[3:12:05.800 --> 3:12:12.680]  what could be going on that prompts them to go to this insane step right now and the fact is
[3:12:12.680 --> 3:12:17.960]  they want him gone i mean when this first broke over the weekend all of the national media almost
[3:12:17.960 --> 3:12:22.920]  in unison reported that president trump made an unscheduled visit to the hospital because he was
[3:12:22.920 --> 3:12:28.360]  experiencing chest pains president trump later took to twitter to say it was part one of a yearly
[3:12:28.360 --> 3:12:33.400]  medical exam which is i understand that never happens you go you get everything checked in one
[3:12:33.400 --> 3:12:38.200]  time you don't do it twice so i think that this is a warning shot across the bow from the deep state
[3:12:38.200 --> 3:12:43.240]  but i think i hope president trump is learning very quickly you cannot play games with these people
[3:12:43.240 --> 3:12:49.480]  they will kill you so move quickly and politically legally lawfully take them out meaning through
[3:12:49.480 --> 3:12:54.840]  meaning through the legal system through the criminal justice system before they can go after you
[3:12:57.880 --> 3:13:02.200]  tom you're going to be co-hosting tonight firepower with yourself and will johnson
[3:13:02.200 --> 3:13:06.600]  seven o'clock central band on video and on local radio and tv stations across the country like the
[3:13:06.600 --> 3:13:12.360]  fine station you managed there in which tall kansas anything else that your source said i mean
[3:13:12.360 --> 3:13:16.280]  obviously you asked the source and they had it from sources in the white house let's be clear it
[3:13:16.280 --> 3:13:23.960]  wasn't a feedback loop from info wars no no this source had uh essentially they are i will say that
[3:13:23.960 --> 3:13:28.280]  they have been in dc i'm not going to say if they're there right now but they work extensively with
[3:13:28.280 --> 3:13:33.880]  political candidates in the area and they work with folks who have now made it into the white house
[3:13:33.880 --> 3:13:38.120]  and so they were trying to figure out how to get this out so that it was not just coming from
[3:13:38.840 --> 3:13:44.920]  natural news and info wars and so my thought process is that this is uh this is a very serious
[3:13:44.920 --> 3:13:50.200]  matter and i'm hoping again that the white house to take it as seriously not not not see what you
[3:13:50.200 --> 3:13:56.680]  just said is key there so are you saying you got contacted because folks knew just so it wouldn't
[3:13:56.680 --> 3:14:02.520]  just be from us which i understand because we've been so demonized it's yes essentially yes and
[3:14:02.520 --> 3:14:07.480]  the idea is that uh the conservative media i mean hopefully if we will break this and that we
[3:14:07.480 --> 3:14:11.640]  intend to publish the article here after i'm out the phone with you alex hopefully we can get a
[3:14:11.640 --> 3:14:15.960]  little bit more attention on this um because i i think that everybody knows you're extremely
[3:14:15.960 --> 3:14:19.880]  powerful tool i mean obviously folks know that i work with you they knew that before they called
[3:14:19.880 --> 3:14:25.720]  me but yes the idea is it needs to go wide it needs to go strong people need to understand
[3:14:25.720 --> 3:14:30.120]  because the white house cannot obviously put out a press release saying hey somebody just tried to
[3:14:30.120 --> 3:14:34.120]  put uh get poisoned the president with food poisoning uh well no i mean the secret service
[3:14:34.120 --> 3:14:39.080]  was real honest with me they they said alex the media won't cover this we're giving it to you
[3:14:39.080 --> 3:14:42.760]  and and and everybody knows that's what we do is we hit the barb wire there's just so much
[3:14:42.760 --> 3:14:47.960]  pre demonization up front even though we break up steam we break it all a lot of people still
[3:14:47.960 --> 3:14:53.160]  say oh that's from info or so that's exactly what happened i mean milley was contacted
[3:14:54.680 --> 3:15:00.040]  i was contacted so so different people we obviously they were told contact us to get this out
[3:15:00.040 --> 3:15:03.000]  and so i'm not going to say it comes from trump because i haven't talked to him about it
[3:15:03.000 --> 3:15:07.880]  i've talked to trump in a long time but uh this is going on ladies and gentlemen and it's not the
[3:15:07.880 --> 3:15:12.920]  role of the president obviously to say they've tried to poison him they use surrogates to do that
[3:15:12.920 --> 3:15:17.080]  that's just what the globalists do as well of course they put out this info we're putting out
[3:15:17.080 --> 3:15:23.720]  very accurate info and i'll have more for folks during the war room with o and stroyer coming

[3:17:55.800 --> 3:18:01.880]  trump announced that he was going to move his domicile from new york city to florida where he's
[3:18:01.880 --> 3:18:09.560]  always said he planned to retire to and the left got so excited they said oh he's about to resign
[3:18:09.560 --> 3:18:16.440]  and leave instead of facing impeachment and he's running to florida well now we know why the president
[3:18:16.440 --> 3:18:21.160]  did that he knew the leftist controlled appeals courts were going to say that he had to give up
[3:18:21.160 --> 3:18:27.480]  his tax returns so they can pour over them and harass every business partner he's got they want to
[3:18:27.480 --> 3:18:34.280]  terrorize people that he's worked with and by moving his domicile from new york to florida that gets
[3:18:34.280 --> 3:18:41.240]  around the new york law they passed to get his tax returns that are supposed to be private so all
[3:18:41.240 --> 3:18:47.800]  those people out there holding their breath for the president to resign in his words we're kicking
[3:18:47.800 --> 3:18:57.000]  the deep states ass and he's never gonna resign beto roark came out dozens of times and said we're
[3:18:57.000 --> 3:19:02.200]  gonna confiscate all your semi-automatic rifles and he got all the other democrats on the stage
[3:19:02.200 --> 3:19:08.360]  nine others to agree and said that he was a hero think about that now those democrats have taken
[3:19:08.360 --> 3:19:15.400]  all the guns in the cities they control their blue cities are literal crap holes covered with needles
[3:19:15.400 --> 3:19:21.400]  and with massive drug dealing and incredible levels of violent crime they know what they're doing
[3:19:22.040 --> 3:19:27.400]  and now the supreme courts come out and ruled that gun manufacturers can be sued into oblivion
[3:19:27.400 --> 3:19:32.440]  for what criminals do using their firearms my goodness ladies and gentlemen this country's under
[3:19:32.440 --> 3:19:38.280]  such incredible attack but more and more towns and cities are saying they're sanctuaries for the
[3:19:38.280 --> 3:19:42.680]  second amendment and they're going to follow the original bill of rights and constitution and
[3:19:42.680 --> 3:19:47.320]  they're not going to help in the confiscation of guns so you see a lot of these cities ignore
[3:19:47.320 --> 3:19:57.160]  illegal aliens well we could ignore all your unconstitutional laws you're listening to the alex
[3:19:57.160 --> 3:20:25.880]  jones show the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex jones show with gerald selente
[3:20:28.120 --> 3:20:34.920]  hello hello great being on the alex jones show thank you so much for having me
[3:20:35.800 --> 3:20:42.600]  and of course my work is trend forecasting wrote the book trends 2000 trend tracking far better
[3:20:42.600 --> 3:20:50.280]  than megatrends time magazine and of course we publish the trends journal magazine it's a weekly
[3:20:50.280 --> 3:20:57.720]  no other magazine like it anywhere i mentioned this because what's going on in the world i've
[3:20:57.720 --> 3:21:03.720]  never seen before in my life and people aren't following the trends they're caught up in the
[3:21:03.720 --> 3:21:12.920]  junk news when you watch the mainstream media news in america it's concentrated right now on the
[3:21:12.920 --> 3:21:22.520]  impeachment hearings it's a waste of time by concentrating on this and knowing the details
[3:21:22.520 --> 3:21:28.520]  of nothing you're losing the information about what's going on around the world that's shaping
[3:21:28.520 --> 3:21:34.920]  the future and that's going to affect your business your profession your life and the nation
[3:21:35.480 --> 3:21:41.320]  and the other nations around the world so today what i'd like to do is to go over some of the
[3:21:41.320 --> 3:21:50.280]  the big current events forming future trends so you can see the future how it's developing
[3:21:50.280 --> 3:22:01.880]  devolving and evolving and what you can do to prepare prevail and prosper so if you look for
[3:22:01.880 --> 3:22:11.560]  example at the new york times they call themselves all the news that fits that's fit to print the paper
[3:22:11.560 --> 3:22:18.840]  record i call it a toilet paper record and it's not the news that's fit to print it's garbage news
[3:22:19.400 --> 3:22:27.480]  so here's the front page story right at the top bloomberg says he now regrets stop and fris
[3:22:27.480 --> 3:22:38.360]  this ahead of a potential democratic presidential run former mayor michael r bloomberg the r is
[3:22:38.360 --> 3:22:47.000]  repulsive of new york on sunday reversed his longstanding support of the aggressive stop
[3:22:47.000 --> 3:22:56.040]  and frisk policing strategy that he pursued for a decade and that led to the disproportionate
[3:22:56.040 --> 3:23:04.360]  stopping of black and latino people across the city i was wrong mr bloomberg declared
[3:23:05.480 --> 3:23:18.200]  and i am sorry every time somebody gets caught doing something disgusting and particularly
[3:23:18.200 --> 3:23:28.520]  if they're a public figure they're always sorry they're not sorry they're sorry they got caught
[3:23:30.600 --> 3:23:39.640]  he's sorry he did this because he's running now probably or possibly as a contestant in the
[3:23:39.640 --> 3:23:47.320]  presidential reality show on the democratic ticket and he's sorry because it may lose
[3:23:47.320 --> 3:23:54.360]  in votes this is like that little other clown out there that the prince the prince over there in
[3:23:55.000 --> 3:24:00.360]  the uk i love these people they're princes prince you know yeah you know you could do with the prince
[3:24:00.360 --> 3:24:07.880]  stuff and sir you know they give them all these titles because he was caught with the jeffrey
[3:24:07.880 --> 3:24:14.840]  epstein thing you know i'm sorry yeah you're sorry you got caught but this is the way the media
[3:24:14.840 --> 3:24:24.520]  portrays things and gives the rich the breaks to get them off so that's one of the stories that's
[3:24:25.240 --> 3:24:34.520]  just i i mentioned that because it also demonstrates how weak how weak the democratic
[3:24:34.520 --> 3:24:42.920]  side is on the presidential reality show back in the beginning when he was being propped up by
[3:24:42.920 --> 3:24:50.040]  oprah i thought that guy beto or rock had a shot i didn't realize how stupid he was and how empty the
[3:24:50.040 --> 3:24:57.400]  clown boy was and so he went down and i matter of fact i even mentioned it to alex jones and i was
[3:24:57.400 --> 3:25:07.720]  wrong on that one there's nobody there that has the strength right now to beat trump in the 2020
[3:25:07.720 --> 3:25:15.720]  presidential reality show and he's a reality show champion just for the record and the impeachment
[3:25:15.720 --> 3:25:22.760]  thing is it's just again a waste of time and the democrats are doing it so that they could weaken
[3:25:22.760 --> 3:25:30.360]  his stance but i make it very clear that the front runners and it doesn't look like biden's going to
[3:25:30.360 --> 3:25:38.920]  be it will probably warren or sanders it won't be able to win the swing state votes other news
[3:25:42.520 --> 3:25:54.120]  battle between protesters and police intensify in hong kong this is very big not only because it's
[3:25:54.120 --> 3:26:03.560]  hong kong which is the banking hub to asia and extremely important important to china
[3:26:04.600 --> 3:26:09.880]  but it's what's going on around the world at different levels that i've never seen before in
[3:26:09.880 --> 3:26:21.320]  my life never it's going on in bolivia again a different issue yes and no in the sense that
[3:26:21.320 --> 3:26:27.240]  the economy is weighed down and people are frustrated with the ruling elites but again
[3:26:27.240 --> 3:26:34.200]  is there a coup element in that probably yes because they're rich in lithium rich in other
[3:26:34.200 --> 3:26:40.600]  natural resources that the corporations have been waging wars for for centuries to get
[3:26:41.720 --> 3:26:48.680]  and you keep going back to the however far back you want to go and it's always about the bottom
[3:26:48.680 --> 3:26:55.320]  line it has nothing to do with freedom and democracy as i say you think we'd be in the
[3:26:55.320 --> 3:27:02.920]  middle east if the major export was broccoli you think you'd care about venezuela if they weren't
[3:27:02.920 --> 3:27:10.600]  sitting on the world's largest oil supplies so the same thing down there but in other nations
[3:27:10.600 --> 3:27:22.920]  as well in algeria in sudan an issue in spain about freedom hong kong lebanon chile
[3:27:24.840 --> 3:27:30.840]  one country after another a rock poverty corruption
[3:27:30.840 --> 3:27:40.840]  violence no jobs no future these are the issues and events that people should be watching
[3:27:41.640 --> 3:27:49.320]  because they have grave implications not only in terms of social unrest and murders of innocent
[3:27:49.320 --> 3:27:55.400]  people and decays of entire societies but what are the implications going to be
[3:27:55.400 --> 3:28:07.560]  hey hey you think you have a migrant crisis now you haven't seen anything yet as people escape
[3:28:07.560 --> 3:28:15.880]  honduras and nicaragua and chile in venezuela and bolivia and columbia oh i forgot to bring

[3:30:02.040 --> 3:30:08.200]  that a tyrant will take humanity to how far will they go what's their limit and he said it is the
[3:30:08.200 --> 3:30:18.120]  limit to which other men and women will submit the answer is there is no limit to evil it is a
[3:30:18.120 --> 3:30:26.440]  bottomless pit we've been taught in modern culture and society that evil doesn't exist or that there's
[3:30:26.440 --> 3:30:32.520]  no free will there's no devil or the god but those very same people have all these rules for us about
[3:30:32.520 --> 3:30:39.720]  speech and how we can dress and where we can live and what our houses can be like they just don't
[3:30:39.720 --> 3:30:46.440]  want us to have any values so they can run over us oxford's band clapping universities the us of
[3:30:46.440 --> 3:30:51.800]  band 21 gun salutes for veterans these people are dangerous cult leaders and it's time to reject them
[3:30:52.440 --> 3:30:59.080]  the globalists know that i will never willingly give up i've said it many times i will never give in
[3:30:59.080 --> 3:31:07.080]  i will never give up but i could give out and it's very very frustrating to see them committing
[3:31:07.080 --> 3:31:14.040]  all their crimes against humanity to see evil running rampant like this and to know that most
[3:31:14.040 --> 3:31:20.200]  americans have already been silenced in cyberspace that most americans have already been shadowband
[3:31:20.200 --> 3:31:27.000]  by big tech and to know that most americans feel powerless and don't realize how much power they
[3:31:27.000 --> 3:31:33.800]  have by spreading the word about news wars dot com info wars dot com and band on video
[3:31:33.800 --> 3:31:38.200]  and that people are hungry for the truth now more than ever and then if you tell people hey
[3:31:38.200 --> 3:31:43.640]  the band truth they don't want you to have is at info wars dot com port slash show and band
[3:31:43.640 --> 3:31:48.920]  on video so take heart folks they've had to censor everybody to shut everybody down because the
[3:31:48.920 --> 3:31:55.080]  truth is powerful and they can't beat us fair and square i've made a lot of predictions that
[3:31:55.080 --> 3:32:00.760]  have come true but i'm here to tell you that most of those really weren't predictions that came out
[3:32:00.760 --> 3:32:07.080]  of a crystal ball i could see where the globalists were going i could see what their in-game agenda
[3:32:07.080 --> 3:32:12.840]  was what their goal was and i knew that when they were setting a sub to bd platform that they were
[3:32:12.840 --> 3:32:20.520]  really setting the precedent to take everybody off air to to silence everyone to ban words and
[3:32:20.520 --> 3:32:27.080]  names and information on fake whistleblowers so that their false narratives couldn't be opposed
[3:32:27.080 --> 3:32:34.120]  what the globalists really feared was independent media and platforms in the future it was the model
[3:32:34.120 --> 3:32:40.040]  of info wars as much as the information that had to be silenced because they need total
[3:32:40.040 --> 3:32:44.840]  information dominance for their outrageous lies and the evil they're pushing to succeed and that's
[3:32:44.840 --> 3:32:53.800]  why keeping info wars on the air is now more imperative and more vital than ever
[3:32:55.320 --> 3:33:01.800]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:33:01.800 --> 3:33:11.800]  you
[3:33:11.800 --> 3:33:19.800]  waging war on corruption it's gerald salente you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:33:23.560 --> 3:33:31.160]  hello hello wait to be back on the alex jones show yep and censorship is a big one so do everything
[3:33:31.160 --> 3:33:38.200]  you can to support info wars but your money where your heart is of course i love my super
[3:33:38.200 --> 3:33:46.360]  male vitality is staying on some of the news here's another story in the toilet paper record
[3:33:47.000 --> 3:33:54.600]  the new york slime an electric mustang suv detroit's big sustainable bet well here's our bet
[3:33:54.600 --> 3:34:00.600]  our bet is that electric vehicles are going to maintain a this is our trend forecast actually
[3:34:01.080 --> 3:34:11.560]  a very tiny portion of the overall global auto market the battery is a 1800 invention
[3:34:12.360 --> 3:34:18.520]  and although they keep trying to improve it and of course lithium batteries and again many people
[3:34:18.520 --> 3:34:24.520]  are saying that the overthrow of the medoro government in bolivia has to do with all the
[3:34:24.520 --> 3:34:31.400]  lithium that they have over there it's not sustainable in the sense that this is very
[3:34:31.400 --> 3:34:38.040]  expensive to do they're not that environmentally friendly when you look at all the work that
[3:34:38.040 --> 3:34:45.560]  goes into getting lithium and all the other ingredients needed to build these batteries
[3:34:45.560 --> 3:34:55.400]  that in ice cold weather they don't work very well as we saw last year when they lost well over 50
[3:34:55.400 --> 3:35:04.680]  percent of their capacity when that cold weather hit so the electric vehicle market for us isn't
[3:35:04.680 --> 3:35:11.560]  one that we would bet on we don't give financial advice we give trend forecasts and another one
[3:35:11.560 --> 3:35:22.840]  in the auto industry that we see going very very slowly and not too far is the driverless vehicles
[3:35:25.240 --> 3:35:40.680]  just last week nissan recalled let me see how many here 400,000 cars in us over potential fire
[3:35:40.680 --> 3:35:55.000]  has it 400,000 and this is like there's been millions of recalls every year tens of millions
[3:35:55.000 --> 3:36:03.000]  so if they're recalling cars with these kind of problems could you imagine self-driving cars
[3:36:03.000 --> 3:36:12.040]  it's a driverless cliff it's not going to happen for a long long time and where it
[3:36:12.040 --> 3:36:19.960]  is going to happen a going from point A to point B maybe on a bus route no not a truck route that
[3:36:19.960 --> 3:36:31.080]  goes around and cross countries not highways yes maybe mining operations of course they will
[3:36:31.080 --> 3:36:39.160]  but places where it's confined and they're only going from point A B C D and E not everywhere
[3:36:39.160 --> 3:36:45.640]  anywhere at any time to us this is a waste of money along with electric vehicles so that's just
[3:36:45.640 --> 3:36:53.000]  an example of how we forecast trends and what we see going on and another one to watch that's
[3:36:53.000 --> 3:36:58.760]  very important it all ties in together is you know they have that big deal over there
[3:36:58.760 --> 3:37:06.440]  over there in Saudi Arabia the Aramco they're looking to raise a hundred billion dollars
[3:37:07.160 --> 3:37:12.440]  as they're making Aramco their their energy company go public well guess what
[3:37:14.120 --> 3:37:19.320]  very few buyers they're lower than number now to 25 billion bucks
[3:37:19.320 --> 3:37:28.680]  oil prices as we speak are around 60 dollars a barrel for Brent crude
[3:37:31.080 --> 3:37:39.160]  Saudi Arabia needs oil and around a hundred dollars a barrel for its economy to break even
[3:37:39.880 --> 3:37:43.080]  oh and then they got that war that they launched over there in Yemen
[3:37:43.080 --> 3:37:51.960]  and it's draining money out of their economy so now that we see oil sales where they are
[3:37:51.960 --> 3:37:56.920]  and we see a global slowdown happening and by the way in the United States they're cutting
[3:37:56.920 --> 3:38:04.760]  back on the rigs they're cutting way back because there's too much supply and not enough demand
[3:38:04.760 --> 3:38:13.720]  and I mentioned this because that's what's going on globally is an economic slowdown
[3:38:14.440 --> 3:38:22.040]  this has nothing to do with trade wars I mentioned autos auto sales are a big indicator
[3:38:22.840 --> 3:38:32.920]  of where economies are going and in India they had auto sales drop 41 percent
[3:38:32.920 --> 3:38:37.560]  you're looking at auto sales slowdowns all over
[3:38:39.560 --> 3:38:43.640]  in the United States they were up a tiny bit this month they were down last month
[3:38:45.560 --> 3:38:52.040]  so these are the kind of indicators to look for it has nothing to do with trade wars again
[3:38:52.040 --> 3:38:58.920]  it has to do with why you're seeing so many of these revolutions and civil wars erupting around
[3:38:58.920 --> 3:39:06.440]  the globe because the dough that went into the economy following the panic of 08
[3:39:07.080 --> 3:39:12.280]  didn't boost the general economy all it did was boost the equity markets
[3:39:14.920 --> 3:39:22.920]  and now as things go down as oil prices go down you're going to start seeing more and more
[3:39:22.920 --> 3:39:31.160]  revolts happening in nations that are oil rich and other product and manufacturing poor
[3:39:32.280 --> 3:39:40.120]  you're going to see a decline in all the commodity prices so the refugee crisis that we have now you
[3:39:40.120 --> 3:39:45.880]  haven't seen anything it's going to be not human waves it's going to be a tsunami
[3:39:45.880 --> 3:39:56.680]  climate change political climate change this is much bigger this is an eruption again like
[3:39:56.680 --> 3:40:04.440]  I've never seen in my life what's going on in Hong Kong is really big because the people
[3:40:04.440 --> 3:40:11.400]  know they have no future with the Chinese government in control they have no future with
[3:40:11.400 --> 3:40:17.880]  the few owning everything and a few do by the way in Hong Kong a few companies one of them
[3:40:17.880 --> 3:40:25.640]  goes back 187 years owns a big section in downtown and the rest of the people having nothing
[3:40:27.240 --> 3:40:35.560]  again one country after another Beirut Lebanon rather the riots in Beirut now what's going on
[3:40:35.560 --> 3:40:44.760]  in Iran when they increased petrol prices by 50 percent which is still relatively low
[3:40:44.760 --> 3:40:51.960]  I think it comes out to about 35 cents a gallon in the United States but because of the sanctions
[3:40:51.960 --> 3:41:00.040]  that Trump's put on them it's economic warfare their GDP is down 9 percent they're expecting this
[3:41:00.040 --> 3:41:10.120]  year according to the international mafia monetary fund so it's important to watch these trends
[3:41:10.120 --> 3:41:17.000]  and not get caught up in the stupidity of them so here's our forecast we see the greatest
[3:41:17.000 --> 3:41:28.280]  depression hitting in 2021 South Korea their economy is expected to grow the lowest in 10 years
[3:41:28.280 --> 3:41:34.840]  you know what they're doing fiscal stimulus the monetary stimulus the pump and cheap money and
[3:41:34.840 --> 3:41:41.080]  isn't working anymore because it's only going into the equity markets so what are they doing
[3:41:41.080 --> 3:41:48.040]  more fiscal stimulus guess what one of the biggest fiscal stimulus programs they've ever launched
[3:41:49.000 --> 3:41:57.320]  not working and that's what the European Central Bank and the IMF are telling the European
[3:41:57.320 --> 3:42:04.120]  to do the European government spend more money spend more money spend more money to boost the
[3:42:04.120 --> 3:42:12.440]  economy it ain't gonna work the human waves of immigrants migrants refugees people escaping
[3:42:12.440 --> 3:42:20.440]  violence corruption and poverty is only going to increase and you think you have a homeless problem
[3:42:20.440 --> 3:42:28.280]  now in a city a state in a country near you you haven't seen anything yet this thing's gonna get a
[3:42:28.280 --> 3:42:36.600]  lot worse so we need plans on how to deal with it and I have one put them in the beautiful country

[3:45:03.880 --> 3:45:09.320]  and said that he was a hero think about that now those democrats have taken all the guns and the
[3:45:09.320 --> 3:45:16.600]  cities they control their blue cities are literal crap holes covered with needles and with massive
[3:45:16.600 --> 3:45:22.760]  drug dealing and incredible levels of violent crime they know what they're doing and now the
[3:45:22.760 --> 3:45:27.640]  supreme courts come out and ruled that gun manufacturers can be sued into oblivion for
[3:45:27.640 --> 3:45:32.760]  what criminals do using their firearms my goodness ladies and gentlemen this country's under such
[3:45:32.760 --> 3:45:38.360]  incredible attack but more and more towns and cities are saying they're sanctuaries for the
[3:45:38.360 --> 3:45:42.680]  second amendment and they're going to follow the original bill of rights and constitution
[3:45:42.680 --> 3:45:47.480]  and they're not going to help in the confiscation of guns so you see a lot of these cities ignore

[3:49:07.480 --> 3:49:13.880]  the world went from a monthly to a weekly actually used to be a quarterly many years ago and now
[3:49:13.880 --> 3:49:20.520]  it's a it's a weekly because events are happening so fast and i talked before about what's going on
[3:49:20.520 --> 3:49:26.360]  and some of the economies but and the stimulus and here's another article just out of from the
[3:49:26.360 --> 3:49:36.600]  financial times japan to launch stimulus plan to support economy into 2021 again this is a country
[3:49:36.600 --> 3:49:44.200]  that has negative interest rates negative bond yields and they can't generate the kind of growth
[3:49:44.200 --> 3:49:52.040]  that they want so this whole stimulus program of going deeper in debt to create more jobs is not
[3:49:52.040 --> 3:49:58.360]  going to work again when you're looking at a failure in places like south korea
[3:49:59.480 --> 3:50:03.560]  one of the largest exporting countries in the world in a very well-to-do economy
[3:50:04.280 --> 3:50:09.640]  you know how limited it all is and on some other
[3:50:12.280 --> 3:50:19.080]  economic news that's very important and looking at for instance where where is gold going
[3:50:19.080 --> 3:50:28.680]  gold's remaining in this zone right now because of what the federal reserve is doing tracking
[3:50:28.680 --> 3:50:33.480]  trends is an understanding of where we are how we got here and where we're going so you look at
[3:50:33.480 --> 3:50:39.160]  the past and see what has happened and you and you see how we got here and then you figure out
[3:50:39.160 --> 3:50:44.200]  okay if this is what happened and this is where we are this is where we're going well guess what
[3:50:44.200 --> 3:50:49.800]  it's a whole new game you know people say to me you know salenti you've got it wrong you said the
[3:50:49.800 --> 3:50:56.600]  markets are going to crash in 2012 you're right i did i got it wrong because i didn't know about
[3:50:56.600 --> 3:51:01.240]  quantitative easing and zero and negative interest rate policy and negative bond yields
[3:51:02.040 --> 3:51:11.240]  to juiced economies the economic markets i should say falsely with this digital money printed on
[3:51:11.240 --> 3:51:17.960]  nothing and backed by nothing again how we got here they didn't teach me that in economics 101 a
[3:51:17.960 --> 3:51:25.960]  graduate school now the markets are going up again and i was very bullish on gold saying that when
[3:51:25.960 --> 3:51:32.760]  it broke over the $1,450 an ounce mark i've been saying this now for five years and it finally did
[3:51:32.760 --> 3:51:42.600]  i said it's going to spike toward 2000 and it was it's shot up we did the gold bull run story
[3:51:42.600 --> 3:51:50.920]  in our trends journal in June of this excuse me yeah in June June 6th of this year and gold was at
[3:51:50.920 --> 3:51:57.480]  $1,332 an ounce shot right up now what happened well it's leveling out we're speaking it's around
[3:51:57.480 --> 3:52:10.680]  $1,460 to $70 an ounce because now investors are back in to the equity markets why what pulled
[3:52:10.680 --> 3:52:16.520]  them out well i pulled them out because the markets are overvalued and it's getting expensive to
[3:52:16.520 --> 3:52:23.960]  gamble but the federal reserve has come to the rescue according to the latest report that just
[3:52:23.960 --> 3:52:31.560]  came out the federal reserve since the middle of september when there was a problem with the
[3:52:31.560 --> 3:52:38.840]  repoed markets the overnight markets where they borrow money to go gamble interest rates have
[3:52:38.840 --> 3:52:46.440]  went from 2 percent to 10 percent the federal reserve injected more money in how much money
[3:52:46.440 --> 3:52:55.400]  they've put in since then you ready
[3:52:57.960 --> 3:53:08.520]  three trillion dollars three trillion dollars like a hundred and twenty billion dollars at night
[3:53:08.520 --> 3:53:16.440]  they're injecting in there so the money junkies the gamblers could go out and gamble the next day
[3:53:16.440 --> 3:53:25.560]  that's what's driving the market up today trump met with one of the boneheads as he called them
[3:53:26.360 --> 3:53:29.880]  a while back the fed shared your own power
[3:53:31.800 --> 3:53:35.400]  Powell said they were going to be you know it looks like things are pretty solid
[3:53:35.400 --> 3:53:45.480]  you may not be raising interest rates we totally disagree we're forecasting they're going to lower
[3:53:45.480 --> 3:53:53.480]  interest rates by this time next year to zero or negative i mentioned this because it's going
[3:53:53.480 --> 3:54:02.680]  to be positive for gold gold is not moving up and down because of what they're saying trade was
[3:54:02.680 --> 3:54:06.440]  oh it's easing it's getting worse it's gazing it's getting worse every day is we're going
[3:54:06.440 --> 3:54:12.280]  off for two years you think the markets would be up as high as they are if there were trade war
[3:54:12.280 --> 3:54:19.640]  worries well they got some 24 percent this year and we'd be hearing trade war virtually every day
[3:54:20.520 --> 3:54:28.040]  there's nothing to do with that it has to do with cheap money so the more cheap money that goes
[3:54:28.040 --> 3:54:38.040]  into the markets the more valuable gold becomes so as the markets rise however the money doesn't
[3:54:38.040 --> 3:54:45.560]  go into safe haven assets it goes back into gambling should gold prices go below one thousand
[3:54:45.560 --> 3:54:52.440]  four hundred and fifty dollars an ounce let's say they go to 140 then they go to 148 and back
[3:54:52.440 --> 3:55:01.240]  to 143 145 our forecast is they're going to go as low as one thousand three hundred ninety
[3:55:01.240 --> 3:55:08.760]  dollars an ounce and that's what we're calling the bottom for gold because around the world whether
[3:55:08.760 --> 3:55:19.240]  it's Serbia whether it's Uzbekistan Kazakhstan Russia China they're buying up gold the central
[3:55:19.240 --> 3:55:25.320]  banksters because they know where to fraud this whole thing ends central banks are bought up more
[3:55:25.320 --> 3:55:35.080]  gold than they have in 50 years and they're going to keep buying it and what's very important is
[3:55:35.080 --> 3:55:43.400]  that gold is still staying strong even though the dollar is strong because the stronger the
[3:55:43.400 --> 3:55:49.400]  dollar gets the weaker gold goes because gold is dollar based so if you're living in China
[3:55:49.400 --> 3:55:57.080]  Venezuela Russia Turkey and your economy is weaker and your currency is going down it takes more
[3:55:57.080 --> 3:56:04.680]  your currency to buy gold so what could change that the changes in the works with a dollar may
[3:56:04.680 --> 3:56:11.560]  be losing its dominance it doesn't happen overnight you go back in history you know
[3:56:11.560 --> 3:56:18.760]  there were many many currencies before the dollar dealt with the world currencies even though it was
[3:56:18.760 --> 3:56:25.880]  a different world and before the dollar of course it was the English pound but the pound got pounded
[3:56:26.600 --> 3:56:35.480]  after the disastrous world war one and then the sun began to set on the British empire
[3:56:35.480 --> 3:56:43.320]  and it went down from there and the dollar went up so some interesting notes to consider
[3:56:45.080 --> 3:56:52.280]  Kremlin aims to reduce dollar shares of wealth fund to protect against sanctions
[3:56:54.120 --> 3:57:02.040]  alternative currency are looking for today headline news China is building up its shadow
[3:57:02.040 --> 3:57:13.080]  reserves to counter its reliance on the US dollar the death of the dollar it's not imminent but hey
[3:57:15.560 --> 3:57:24.840]  you're born you grow you mature you reach old age and then you die the dollar is nearing maturity
[3:57:24.840 --> 3:57:31.800]  not yet ready to die thank you again for tuning in thank you for having me on and remember
