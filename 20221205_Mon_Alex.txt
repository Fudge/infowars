[00:00.000 --> 00:17.720]  By opening the floodgates to unfettered free speech, Elon Musk has allowed hate to spread
[00:17.720 --> 00:20.200]  far and fast on Twitter.
[00:20.200 --> 00:25.800]  While the left winds out another distraction about Matt Taibbi catering to the richest
[00:25.800 --> 00:31.800]  man in the world, what do the Twitter files reveal about the inner workings of, as Taibbi
[00:31.800 --> 00:39.800]  described, a Frankensteinian tale of a human-built mechanism grown out of the control of its designer.
[00:39.800 --> 00:46.000]  By 2020, requests from the New World Ordered Disciples to delete tweets were routine.
[00:46.000 --> 00:50.240]  One executive would write to another, more to review from the Biden team.
[00:50.240 --> 00:52.480]  The reply would come back, handled.
[00:52.480 --> 00:59.120]  Twitter was acting as a wrecking ball of political tech censorship, catering to the corrupt Washington
[00:59.120 --> 01:05.760]  establishment, directly impacting and propagandizing a digital town square, which affected the
[01:05.760 --> 01:11.920]  general welfare of the United States, whose lifeblood is protected by the power and freedom
[01:11.920 --> 01:12.920]  of the First Amendment.
[01:12.920 --> 01:18.440]  And if it turns out there are a lot of us on this list, where the DNC targeted us, and
[01:18.440 --> 01:24.960]  I will quote the immortal words of Joseph Welch when he attacked Joe McCarthy for the
[01:24.960 --> 01:31.920]  enemies list he had, at long laughter, have you no shame.
[01:31.920 --> 01:42.200]  President Biden, all of your little operatives in the DNC who have targeted American citizens,
[01:42.200 --> 01:48.080]  have you, Mr. President, have all of you, at last, no shame.
[01:48.080 --> 01:53.120]  Taiibhi points out that both parties had access to these tools.
[01:53.120 --> 01:59.280]  For instance, in 2020, requests from both the Trump White House and the Biden campaign
[01:59.280 --> 02:01.680]  were received and honored.
[02:01.680 --> 02:07.720]  But the overwhelming amount of leftist Marxist cucks staffed at Twitter ensured that Democrat
[02:07.720 --> 02:13.760]  Party requests took the front burner, a fact backed up by the overall donations by Twitter
[02:13.760 --> 02:26.760]  to the Democrat Party reaching 99.73% or $165,969 to Democrats, while $451 went to Republicans
[02:26.760 --> 02:27.760]  in 2022.
[02:27.760 --> 02:30.440]  Are you worried about these Twitter files coming out?
[02:30.440 --> 02:35.720]  What was that experience like having Kellyanne, who's always in control of herself, sickening
[02:35.720 --> 02:38.480]  this mega trolls on you?
[02:38.480 --> 02:39.480]  It's terrifying.
[02:39.480 --> 02:45.520]  When you get targeted in some of these ways, it's hard to differentiate between what is
[02:45.520 --> 02:49.520]  somebody just online trying to rattle you and what's a real threat.
[02:49.520 --> 02:55.840]  You see in things like Pizzagate that online conspiracies can mobilize very real and very
[02:55.840 --> 02:58.000]  direct offline violence.
[02:58.000 --> 03:04.040]  I saw those harms, I experienced those harms, and now it was those harms through a mainstream
[03:04.040 --> 03:08.960]  news outlet being held up in the Oval Office by the former president of the United States,
[03:08.960 --> 03:11.480]  and that is deeply terrifying.
[03:11.480 --> 03:16.960]  What does appear to be illegal to the point of treason is that a false narrative of possible
[03:16.960 --> 03:23.880]  foreign hacks supposedly behind the Biden laptop debacle was manufactured by Silicon
[03:23.880 --> 03:26.840]  Valley, the media, and the DNC.
[03:26.840 --> 03:32.520]  Well we know that this whole smear on Joe Biden comes from the Kremlin.
[03:32.520 --> 03:37.000]  That's been clear for well over a year now that they've been pushing this false narrative
[03:37.000 --> 03:39.160]  about the vice president and his son.
[03:39.160 --> 03:45.040]  According to internal emails, there was zero evidence of foreign interference occurring.
[03:45.040 --> 03:50.640]  What did occur was a meltdown of internal Twitter censorship spearheaded by top Twitter
[03:50.640 --> 03:57.200]  management with the result of ultimately burying a critical story under false pretenses in
[03:57.200 --> 04:03.480]  order to sway popular opinion and alter the outcome of the 2020 presidential election.
[04:03.480 --> 04:09.240]  In retrospect, we now know that as the New York Post reported, nearly four of five Americans
[04:09.240 --> 04:14.360]  who've been following the Hunter Biden laptop scandal believe that truthful coverage would
[04:14.360 --> 04:18.680]  have changed the outcome of the 2020 presidential election.
[04:18.680 --> 04:24.560]  And an even higher number, 81% said U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland should investigate
[04:24.560 --> 04:25.760]  the laptop.
[04:25.760 --> 04:31.200]  Not only have Twitter employees like Head of Legal, Policy & Trust, Vijaya Gaudi,
[04:31.200 --> 04:38.080]  and Trust and Safety Chief Yole Roth proven that they willingly altered the 2020 U.S.
[04:38.080 --> 04:43.600]  presidential election, but they have demonstrated that Silicon Valley, the Mockingbird media
[04:43.600 --> 04:49.000]  and the corruption in Washington is an occupying force and a direct threat to the stability
[04:49.000 --> 04:52.160]  and the future of the United States of America.
[04:52.160 --> 04:56.640]  This cyber insurrection is what I'm calling it, is an assault on this country and it's
[04:56.640 --> 05:03.640]  a corn-lined treason if you think about what the executives did at the time of the election.
[05:56.640 --> 06:03.640]  Don't wait, take action at m4store.com today.
[06:56.640 --> 07:15.640]  I know why you did it, I know you were afraid, who wouldn't be, war, terror, disease, there
[07:15.640 --> 07:20.520]  were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your
[07:20.520 --> 07:21.520]  common sense.
[07:21.520 --> 07:26.920]  Fear got the best of you and in your panic you turned to the now high chancellor, Adam
[07:26.920 --> 07:27.920]  Sutler.
[07:27.920 --> 07:33.160]  He promised you order, he promised you peace and all he demanded in return was your silent
[07:33.160 --> 08:00.200]  obedient consent.
[08:00.200 --> 08:05.840]  President Trump gives every indication by what he says and what he does and what he doesn't
[08:05.840 --> 08:12.840]  do that he's mean as a Wolverine.
[08:12.840 --> 08:22.040]  It's 1159 at Radio Free America and this is Uncle Stan with Music and the Truth Until
[08:22.040 --> 08:23.040]  Dawn.
[08:23.040 --> 08:27.080]  Right now I've got a few words for some of our brothers and sisters in the occupied zone.
[08:27.080 --> 08:33.320]  The chair is against the wall, the chair is against the wall, John has a long mustache,
[08:33.320 --> 08:38.520]  John has a long mustache, it's 12 o'clock American, another day closer to victory and
[08:38.520 --> 08:44.520]  for all of you out there on or behind the lines, this is your song.
[08:44.520 --> 08:51.600]  But they took a lot of people away, people that they thought were going to make trouble
[08:51.600 --> 08:55.680]  for them, people that had guns and things they wanted, they just took them away.
[08:55.680 --> 09:02.680]  So part of this is you have to raise your kind of a private idea that kids belong to
[09:02.680 --> 09:07.040]  their parents or kids belong to their families or recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[09:07.040 --> 09:17.440]  I have decided we really need camps for adults and we need five camps that you all run, I
[09:17.440 --> 09:18.440]  mean really.
[09:18.440 --> 09:21.840]  All persons of Japanese descent were required to register.
[09:21.840 --> 09:25.880]  Now they were taken to racetracks and fairgrounds where the Army almost overnight had built
[09:25.880 --> 09:26.880]  assembly centers.
[09:26.880 --> 09:30.920]  I'm a solid citizen, I refuse to recognize you guys.
[09:30.920 --> 09:33.920]  What kind of a situation in the U.S. would you see that happening?
[09:33.920 --> 09:37.920]  I mean we've got a lot of Constitution lists and a lot of people that it's not far away.
[09:37.920 --> 09:41.600]  Plus you have a lot of people that are coming out of the military that have the ability
[09:41.600 --> 09:48.400]  and the knowledge to build IEDs and to defeat law enforcement techniques.
[09:48.400 --> 09:53.160]  These people are radicalized and they don't support the United States and they're disloyal
[09:53.160 --> 09:54.160]  to the United States.
[09:54.160 --> 09:59.160]  It's our right and our obligation to segregate them from the normal community.
[09:59.160 --> 10:10.160]  It's what we're doing here unless not a kid about it, we're building a domestic Army because
[10:10.160 --> 10:13.320]  the government is afraid of its own citizens.
[10:13.320 --> 10:16.440]  Put your gun down really?
[10:16.440 --> 10:21.520]  Rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[10:21.520 --> 10:23.240]  It's Alex Jones.
[10:23.240 --> 10:26.080]  Are you some kind of a Constitutionist?
[10:26.080 --> 10:35.240]  So these people who hold themselves out to be patriots or not are nothing more than domestic
[10:35.240 --> 10:36.240]  terrorists.
[10:36.240 --> 10:54.360]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[10:54.360 --> 11:10.400]  And that Trump gives every indication by what he says and what he does and what he doesn't
[11:10.400 --> 11:16.160]  do that he's mean as a Wolverine.
[11:16.160 --> 11:27.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Monday, December 5th, 2022, I'm your host Alex Jones and something
[11:27.760 --> 11:31.920]  happened last night yesterday that's gotten really no attention.
[11:31.920 --> 11:46.000]  That's a big deal, missiles, kit and damaged, Russian nuclear bombers deep inside Russia.
[11:46.000 --> 11:49.320]  That's how wars escalate into thermal nuclear war.
[11:49.320 --> 11:56.160]  The Moscow Times, three killed nuclear capable bombers likely damaged in Russian airfield
[11:56.160 --> 12:06.800]  explosion, there's video coming up, we'll get to next segment where you see a missile
[12:06.800 --> 12:17.160]  straight through the air or missiles and then the target is struck.
[12:17.160 --> 12:21.320]  This is getting completely out of control very, very quickly.
[12:21.320 --> 12:28.040]  We're going to be looking at that in detail obviously here today, coming up next segment.
[12:28.040 --> 12:33.480]  The Twitter files, the first tranche of which Musk released over the weekend or on Friday
[12:33.480 --> 12:37.800]  are just devastating is what exactly what I told you, government interfacing with think
[12:37.800 --> 12:44.320]  tanks and big tech and dinosaur media, surveilling people online and censoring people at the
[12:44.320 --> 12:51.440]  direction of the FBI and the Justice Department and the ADL.
[12:51.440 --> 12:57.320]  This is a trillion times bigger than anything Richard Nixon did, literally, I mean it's
[12:57.320 --> 13:01.560]  just, Nixon had a safe with a hundred something names in it, he was thinking about using the
[13:01.560 --> 13:02.560]  IRS on.
[13:02.560 --> 13:06.480]  So we've seen Loris Lerner under Obama, persecuted hundreds of thousands of conservatives and
[13:06.480 --> 13:11.640]  we've seen no one get in trouble and so now it's just escalated, escalated, escalated
[13:11.640 --> 13:16.160]  by the deep state when Trump was in office, going after him, going after American people.
[13:16.160 --> 13:20.440]  Now we begin to learn what I told you years ago, the full extent of it, because it was
[13:20.440 --> 13:26.340]  all in the government spending documents, it was in Obama's challenging foreign disinformation
[13:26.340 --> 13:35.680]  and propaganda act when he left office in 2017, he signed those executive orders and
[13:35.680 --> 13:40.600]  Trump never reversed them because he'd never been in government.
[13:40.600 --> 13:45.480]  I told Trump about it on the phone and that's when my life became a living hell and they
[13:45.480 --> 13:49.640]  admitted they said our main mission headline is to keep Trump away from Alex Jones'
[13:49.640 --> 13:57.280]  force, they said General Kelly's quote main job, CNN headline, is keeping Trump away from
[13:57.280 --> 14:01.520]  Info Wars and Alex Jones, so I'm like sir, here's the group, here's the names, Fiona
[14:01.520 --> 14:07.000]  Hill, they're running the Soros Mall operation, because I'm just a loyal American that cares
[14:07.000 --> 14:12.880]  about my country and you've seen the aftermath of that because they never thought a citizen
[14:12.880 --> 14:17.400]  would actually study government and how this is going on, so I'm not here to get the credit,
[14:17.400 --> 14:22.120]  I'm not here to say oh look, we did it first, but remember all the CNN headlines, Alex Jones
[14:22.120 --> 14:28.200]  is insane, he claims the government's spying on Trump and claims that government's working
[14:28.200 --> 14:35.720]  with Big Tech to censor and now where are we, you're living it, it's out in the open,
[14:35.720 --> 14:41.600]  it's not just going after Alex Jones or Trump now, it's going after you, so we've got that
[14:41.600 --> 14:48.920]  huge news, we've got massive news out of Brazil, Brazilian military kills, red command leaders
[14:48.920 --> 14:52.640]  and has been making announcements through different channels that they are strongly
[14:52.640 --> 15:00.480]  considering removing the Lula government because of evidence of fraud, it's in the Constitution,
[15:00.480 --> 15:05.280]  they can do that, when branches of government are deadlocked, you have the executive and
[15:05.280 --> 15:10.960]  the judiciary deadlocked, the judiciary or the communists that control the elections
[15:10.960 --> 15:17.840]  and you've seen what's happening, so we're going to be laying all that out today and
[15:17.840 --> 15:26.360]  so much more, obviously there's a lot of deindustrialization, post-industrial world news, it's just
[15:26.360 --> 15:38.680]  off the charts, incredible, it's not Alex Jones telling you an Obama deception, in 2004
[15:38.680 --> 15:43.480]  you're going to shut down the farms and take your gasoline cars away and have carbon lockdowns,
[15:43.480 --> 15:48.720]  it's now been announced, got a big stack on that as well, want to know what they are doing
[15:48.720 --> 15:52.520]  and how to stop them, we know how to do it, we know what we're doing, please stay with
[15:52.520 --> 15:57.080]  us, you want to be free to defeat the globalist, share the link to infowars.com forward slash
[15:57.080 --> 16:00.560]  show.
[16:00.560 --> 16:06.600]  December 2022 is here and we are proud and very excited to announce that free shipping

[16:30.040 --> 16:34.040]  so excited about it, our listeners have really asked for free shipping again, we couldn't
[16:34.040 --> 16:38.200]  afford it before, but by moving to a bigger national distributor we're able to do it,
[16:38.200 --> 16:43.760]  so now your orders will be shipped even faster, the same great customer service and more,

[16:53.840 --> 17:00.840]  system, lead a healthier life and keep infowars on the air, infowarsstore.com.
[17:00.840 --> 17:07.640]  It's hard to believe sometimes that we are still live on air, broadcasting free worldwide
[17:07.640 --> 17:15.120]  and it seems quite real that things can change in an instant, things are getting very weird
[17:15.120 --> 17:20.480]  and it's definitely more difficult than ever to even know what's going on, but we'll keep
[17:20.480 --> 17:28.280]  doing our best so long as you keep us on the air and you can do that now at infowarsstore.com,
[17:28.280 --> 17:34.800]  help us clear out our stock of bodies tumored, vitamin c with zinc and alpha power, turn
[17:34.800 --> 17:40.120]  those shady Federal Reserve notes into the highest quality supplements available while
[17:40.120 --> 17:48.160]  they still last, now with free shipping, we thank you for your support and we wish you
[17:48.160 --> 18:00.120]  a very peaceful, happy and merry Christmas.
[18:00.120 --> 18:06.000]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be
[18:06.000 --> 18:11.360]  allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deemed fit.
[18:11.360 --> 18:15.200]  The First Amendment is unique in the world, that's what they want to take away, your ability
[18:15.200 --> 18:16.200]  to speak freely.
[18:16.200 --> 18:19.280]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next, or they're going to go for Steve Bannon,
[18:19.280 --> 18:20.920]  or they're going to go for Tucker Carlson.
[18:20.920 --> 18:25.080]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago, but on air 28 years, and I knew they were planning
[18:25.080 --> 18:29.000]  all of this, and I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere, but I couldn't have done
[18:29.000 --> 18:32.680]  it without your support, and now because we've been so successful warning the population
[18:32.680 --> 18:36.960]  of the planet, not just America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist
[18:36.960 --> 18:37.960]  agenda.
[18:37.960 --> 18:41.640]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful info wars has been
[18:41.640 --> 18:43.320]  because of your past support.
[18:43.320 --> 18:47.120]  So I salute you, and I thank you, and I ask you now, the critical juncture of the battle,

[19:00.160 --> 19:04.840]  Everybody that's watching this needs to support Alex Jones, needs to support Info Wars and
[19:04.840 --> 19:05.840]  band.video.

[19:10.200 --> 19:16.240]  Alex Jones has helped so many people in this industry, you guys have no idea how many people
[19:16.240 --> 19:21.360]  have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez, how many people have just been put on a launch
[19:21.360 --> 19:26.120]  pad to outer space because of Alex Jones, including myself, I've been given so many
[19:26.120 --> 19:30.600]  opportunities because of this man and because of this platform, and I would probably not
[19:30.600 --> 19:34.480]  even be half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex Jones, I mean, I've been
[19:34.480 --> 19:40.440]  able to be on podcast with Alex and Joe Rogan and Tim Cass, the super Tim Cass IRL.
[19:40.440 --> 19:45.600]  Listen, what I'm saying is, do not take Alex Jones and band.video for granted because you
[19:45.600 --> 19:47.800]  don't know what you have until it's gone.
[19:47.800 --> 19:52.480]  We need to support free speech systems right now, so go check out the store, go support
[19:52.480 --> 19:56.160]  their store, go support Info Wars, leave a donation right now.
[19:56.160 --> 20:01.160]  Don't wait until they're gone.
[20:01.160 --> 20:08.160]  Making a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:08.160 --> 20:36.160]  It is December 5th, thank you for joining us on this Monday broadcast.
[20:36.160 --> 20:40.640]  We're definitely covering the topics that the establishment does not want you to know
[20:40.640 --> 20:47.520]  about and does not want you to even think about, because if we expose their operations,
[20:47.520 --> 20:51.960]  the population of this planet, not just America, is going to know that it's the globalists
[20:51.960 --> 20:57.760]  behind it and they're going to be stopped, but if the public continues to be geopolitically
[20:57.760 --> 21:06.000]  and politically and culturally ignorant, we're going to be like a blind man walking off the
[21:06.000 --> 21:12.560]  edge of a cliff here and there's not much time to turn this around.
[21:12.560 --> 21:17.560]  Now, even the London Guardian and the Russian news and the German news, they're all reporting
[21:17.560 --> 21:27.560]  that it's obviously Kiev, Ukraine, that has launched these attacks that have caused explosions
[21:27.560 --> 21:33.160]  at two Russian military bases close to each other, two air bases.
[21:33.160 --> 21:37.600]  Explosions rocked two Russian air bases far from Ukraine's front line.
[21:37.600 --> 21:41.720]  Explosions have rocked two Russian air bases far from the front lines of Kiev as Kiev appeared
[21:41.720 --> 21:46.280]  to launch a preempt to strike on bombers that the Kremlin has used to try to cripple the
[21:46.280 --> 21:48.080]  Ukrainian electrical grid.
[21:48.080 --> 21:52.680]  The attack on Monday is confirmed would be an unexpected operation deep inside Russia
[21:52.680 --> 21:57.440]  meant to disrupt the Kremlin's strategy, provoking an humanitarian catastrophe in Ukraine
[21:57.440 --> 21:59.720]  on the verge of winter.
[21:59.720 --> 22:02.600]  That's the London Guardian.
[22:02.600 --> 22:08.280]  Explosion at nuclear air bases 150 miles from Moscow opened stunning new phase of war.
[22:08.280 --> 22:10.200]  German news.
[22:10.200 --> 22:17.720]  Three killed nuclear cable bombers lightly damaged in Russian air filled explosions.
[22:17.720 --> 22:20.760]  They call that escalation next level, but before I go any further, I've got to do this
[22:20.760 --> 22:24.400]  or we're not going to be here and I just want to be very, very straight with the listeners
[22:24.400 --> 22:27.520]  as I always am and very, very clear.
[22:27.520 --> 22:30.960]  All the corporate news and all the media you hear about me having hundreds of millions
[22:30.960 --> 22:35.280]  of dollars is a complete and total lie.
[22:35.280 --> 22:42.240]  I do not have more than $200,000 in my personal bank account, which is almost nothing when
[22:42.240 --> 22:45.000]  you have the expenses and bills I do.
[22:45.000 --> 22:49.400]  I have basically run out of money to even pay my private legal bills and that's okay.
[22:49.400 --> 22:51.440]  I trust in God.
[22:51.440 --> 22:55.960]  And I've declared personal bankruptcy because I don't have any money and they're lying
[22:55.960 --> 23:00.560]  about that in the news and saying I'm a criminal hiding all these assets and the rest of it.
[23:00.560 --> 23:05.160]  So when you support us and you buy products at infowarstore.com, you keep info wars on
[23:05.160 --> 23:11.040]  the air so we can appeal these false fraudulent criminal verdicts for several years and we're
[23:11.040 --> 23:15.560]  going to win every expert agrees just because they got two state judges that in my view
[23:15.560 --> 23:22.240]  are criminals to do this fraud and tell juries I'm guilty and say $1.5 billion and all the
[23:22.240 --> 23:26.520]  rest of this doesn't mean that the appellate courts are going to go along with it.
[23:26.520 --> 23:30.800]  They can't or it sets a very dangerous precedent.
[23:30.800 --> 23:37.160]  And so the money you buy products for at infowarstore.com does not go to these people.
[23:37.160 --> 23:39.400]  They're acting like this operation already belongs to them.
[23:39.400 --> 23:42.560]  They're acting like they get the money that comes from this operation.
[23:42.560 --> 23:43.560]  That's not the case.
[23:43.560 --> 23:48.320]  We're in chapter 11 sub chapter 5 with free speech systems because it had been pushed
[23:48.320 --> 23:52.840]  to the wall and didn't have the funds, we went to emergency reorganization to keep the
[23:52.840 --> 23:58.600]  operation going indefinitely, okay, and it's going well, despite what the corporate media
[23:58.600 --> 24:01.160]  says because we've been honest, it's all out there in the open.
[24:01.160 --> 24:05.520]  So that keeps the crew employed and this important operation here because you're buying products
[24:05.520 --> 24:08.240]  at infowarstore.com.
[24:08.240 --> 24:13.120]  I have foregone over the last year being paid, but I'm going to have to go ahead and demand
[24:13.120 --> 24:20.080]  to be paid now because buy free speech in the bankruptcy because I can't pay my personal
[24:20.080 --> 24:21.080]  bills.
[24:21.080 --> 24:22.080]  So that's going on.
[24:22.080 --> 24:25.560]  So when you buy products at infowarstore.com, they're supporting info wars and the operation
[24:25.560 --> 24:29.600]  and keeping me operating separately.
[24:29.600 --> 24:33.280]  The personal bankruptcy in the next few weeks will be filed.
[24:33.280 --> 24:34.280]  It will be public.
[24:34.280 --> 24:38.560]  I mean, it's already filed and my assets will then be put on display and you're going to
[24:38.560 --> 24:45.360]  see a Hellcat Dodge car and a couple watches and nothing else.
[24:45.360 --> 24:47.160]  My furniture is cheap.
[24:47.160 --> 24:50.160]  The few televisions I have are like $2,000.
[24:50.160 --> 24:51.280]  I don't have all this stuff.
[24:51.280 --> 24:55.160]  They say almost everything you see in the news is a total lie.
[24:55.160 --> 24:57.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, they put on the news.
[24:57.480 --> 24:58.480]  Here's his house.
[24:58.480 --> 24:59.880]  It's not even my house.
[24:59.880 --> 25:05.000]  They just, I mean, you know they lie, but it's next level.
[25:05.000 --> 25:09.760]  Like when Twitter allowed people to say that James Woods seek Hild and he didn't seek
[25:09.760 --> 25:10.760]  Hild.
[25:10.760 --> 25:11.760]  He's made it up.
[25:11.760 --> 25:13.480]  He's now suing them.
[25:13.480 --> 25:18.280]  So they just make up whatever they want and the level of lies even shocks me.
[25:18.280 --> 25:20.600]  So it's very simple.
[25:20.600 --> 25:21.600]  I am in your hands.
[25:21.600 --> 25:22.600]  This operation is in your hands.
[25:22.600 --> 25:24.400]  Plus we have great products you need.
[25:24.400 --> 25:29.280]  If you don't go to infowarstore.com and do your Christmas shopping at infowarstore, we
[25:29.280 --> 25:33.560]  are not going to be here because we have to pay a lot of the money that comes in to buy
[25:33.560 --> 25:35.360]  future products to come in.
[25:35.360 --> 25:37.160]  More isn't coming in for two or three months.
[25:37.160 --> 25:38.360]  You notice we're out of t-shirts.
[25:38.360 --> 25:39.480]  You notice we're out of a lot of items.
[25:39.480 --> 25:41.480]  I told you this.
[25:41.480 --> 25:46.400]  Everything we're selling on the site, we have in stock ready to ship to you quickly.
[25:46.400 --> 25:51.480]  But we are in the most precarious financial position we've ever been.
[25:51.480 --> 25:52.480]  And it's very simple.
[25:52.480 --> 25:53.480]  We're in your hands.
[25:53.480 --> 25:55.560]  I need you to go to infowarstore.com.
[25:55.560 --> 25:57.720]  We're selling on a DNA Force Plus.
[25:57.720 --> 25:59.720]  We're selling out of Vasovitch.
[25:59.720 --> 26:01.720]  We're selling out of Ultra 12.
[26:01.720 --> 26:06.920]  We're selling out of the 1100% of daily allowance, vitamin C with the zinc, the Linus Pauling
[26:06.920 --> 26:07.920]  formula.
[26:07.920 --> 26:09.680]  It's so incredible for your whole body immune system.
[26:09.680 --> 26:12.560]  We're selling out of the D3 gummies, body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[26:12.560 --> 26:15.440]  The strongest turmeric you're going to find anywhere.
[26:15.440 --> 26:20.200]  And this will all sell out at current sales rates in about a month or sooner.
[26:20.200 --> 26:24.280]  And then I'm going to have to, until the new products come in in a couple months, basically
[26:24.280 --> 26:28.040]  just sit here and ask for money or we're going to go off the year.
[26:28.040 --> 26:29.440]  And then I know the money will flood in.
[26:29.440 --> 26:35.800]  Oh, sorry, we're closing by, but it's very hard to restart something like this up anew.
[26:35.800 --> 26:36.800]  So this is serious.
[26:36.800 --> 26:40.080]  We've been in a major fight with the globalist toe-to-toe.
[26:40.080 --> 26:44.080]  You see the huge results we have, the billions of people we've reached, the tens of millions
[26:44.080 --> 26:45.080]  of Americans.
[26:45.080 --> 26:48.800]  We are the recognized tip of the spear in the fight against the new world order.
[26:48.800 --> 26:54.560]  So get brain force ultra, the incredible, clean, amazing, new tropic that hits in 15
[26:54.560 --> 26:56.280]  minutes, only lasts like three hours.
[26:56.280 --> 26:57.280]  I love it because you can take it.
[26:57.280 --> 27:00.520]  You know, you've got to go to a dinner party, you're tired, it's eight o'clock at night.
[27:00.520 --> 27:03.640]  Take it, get back to the dinner party, go to bed at 11.
[27:03.640 --> 27:07.920]  It's at infowarstore.com, incredible new tropic, so good for your brain, a healthy, stimulant
[27:07.920 --> 27:11.280]  combo, a whole bunch of ingredients.
[27:11.280 --> 27:15.680]  Brain force plus is a good, strong, clean, natural way to have about six, seven hours
[27:15.680 --> 27:16.680]  of energy.
[27:16.680 --> 27:22.680]  You notice having that turbo force in six months, we're trying to get that remanufactured.
[27:22.680 --> 27:25.560]  But some of the ingredients are so high quality, we haven't been able to get them.
[27:25.560 --> 27:30.760]  So whether it's brain force ultra, brain force plus, DNA force plus, vitamin mineral fusion,
[27:30.760 --> 27:35.960]  body's ultimate turmeric formula, they're all there at infowarstore.com and they're amazing
[27:35.960 --> 27:37.880]  and they make your life better and healthier.
[27:37.880 --> 27:39.960]  I told you we're selling out of X2, X3, it's gone.
[27:39.960 --> 27:42.600]  Told you we're selling out of Wake of America coffee, it's gone.
[27:42.600 --> 27:44.800]  I told you we're selling out of Biodritsulinium, it's gone.
[27:44.800 --> 27:46.560]  This is not a game.
[27:46.560 --> 27:50.640]  So what we've got is what we've got and it really is up to you.
[27:50.640 --> 27:54.080]  But this is like a sudden death NFL overtime game.
[27:54.080 --> 28:00.680]  I mean this is right to the minute, this is a horse race, this is to a nose with the horses
[28:00.680 --> 28:04.560]  and this is God just letting me know that it's God because God has always come through
[28:04.560 --> 28:09.000]  in the past working through you but I think everybody go to infowarstore.com and sign
[28:09.000 --> 28:13.040]  up for auto ship and then they always hold back the item for the next month shipment
[28:13.040 --> 28:16.360]  or you can do it every month, every two months, three months, you just click it canceling
[28:16.360 --> 28:20.040]  time for free but that way we'll hold back products so even if it sells out, it'll be
[28:20.040 --> 28:21.280]  held back for you.
[28:21.280 --> 28:26.560]  You also get an additional 10% off when you sign up for auto ship, infowarstore.com or
[28:26.560 --> 28:30.960]  triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine and we're not going to just abruptly
[28:30.960 --> 28:35.960]  shut down or abruptly downsize, we're in an okay position but we're in a very precarious
[28:35.960 --> 28:40.160]  position coming up in a few months when these products sell out.
[28:40.160 --> 28:45.040]  So I'm trying to create a couple fundraiser t-shirts that are new or something that have
[28:45.040 --> 28:49.600]  some big markup on them to try to get some funds in right now so please go to infowarstore.com
[28:49.600 --> 28:54.200]  and take action now, free shipping is back on orders $50 or more.

[29:56.200 --> 30:00.520]  Don't wait, take action at infowarstore.com today.
[30:00.520 --> 30:07.240]  Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world believe that people got sick and
[30:07.240 --> 30:11.840]  died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors.
[30:11.840 --> 30:16.280]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[30:16.280 --> 30:21.120]  Of course it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people, what was killing
[30:21.120 --> 30:24.720]  people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[30:24.720 --> 30:30.880]  You see the sun via your skin helps your body produce vitamin D3.
[30:30.880 --> 30:34.880]  But if you're not getting enough sun, you will not produce vitamin D3 and then it's
[30:34.880 --> 30:39.420]  very easy for viruses and other things to start replicating and taking your body over.
[30:39.420 --> 30:43.360]  So now it's more important than ever because the winter is here to take high quality vitamin
[30:43.360 --> 30:48.060]  D3 and we have the best with our vitamin D3 gummies with calcium for better upload
[30:48.060 --> 30:54.360]  into your body for 50% off at infowarstore.com with promo code 1776.

[31:00.760 --> 31:07.600]  It's hard to believe sometimes that we are still live on air broadcasting free worldwide
[31:07.600 --> 31:13.040]  and it seems quite real that things can change in an instant.
[31:13.040 --> 31:18.680]  Things are getting very weird and it's definitely more difficult than ever to even know what's
[31:18.680 --> 31:19.680]  going on.
[31:19.680 --> 31:25.360]  But we'll keep doing our best so long as you keep us on the air and you can do that now
[31:25.360 --> 31:28.200]  at infowarstore.com.
[31:28.200 --> 31:34.680]  Help us clear out our stock of body's tumor, vitamin C with zinc and alpha power.
[31:34.680 --> 31:39.840]  Turn those shady Federal Reserve notes into the highest quality supplements available
[31:39.840 --> 31:42.040]  while they still last.
[31:42.040 --> 31:49.520]  Now with free shipping, we thank you for your support and we wish you a very peaceful,
[31:49.520 --> 32:00.080]  happy and merry Christmas.
[32:00.080 --> 32:05.440]  The tip of the spear throughout this entire process, the only thing that made any Republican
[32:05.440 --> 32:10.400]  victories tonight possible, the only thing that made any resistance to the war machine
[32:10.400 --> 32:16.040]  possible, the only thing that made any opposition to the lockdowns and the mask mandates and
[32:16.040 --> 32:21.840]  the school shutdowns and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible, made any
[32:21.840 --> 32:27.520]  resistance to it possible was people continuing to support info wars, despite the massive
[32:27.520 --> 32:33.400]  lawfare being waged against info wars, despite the media defamatory libelous campaign against
[32:33.400 --> 32:38.640]  info wars, the ordinary people, the everyday people that buy products that make their own
[32:38.640 --> 32:44.120]  lives healthier, wealthier and wiser is what keeps info wars on the air and what that does
[32:44.120 --> 32:49.680]  is keep the populist message alive in an era and an age of totalitarian oppression.
[32:49.680 --> 32:54.400]  So continue to do it, go to places like info wars store dot com, go to places like save
[32:54.400 --> 32:59.520]  info wars, continue to keep info wars alive because in the process you're keeping American
[32:59.520 --> 33:01.720]  liberty alive.
[33:01.720 --> 33:18.520]  Reading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:18.520 --> 33:27.520]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[33:27.520 --> 33:35.200]  the info war in December of 2016.
[33:35.200 --> 33:46.200]  It was tagged on to the 2017 defense authorization act by Obama and passed by Congress to put
[33:46.200 --> 33:54.720]  more than $3 billion into a government program countering foreign disinformation propaganda
[33:54.720 --> 34:01.120]  act and it said the CIA will merge with the justice department in domestic operations
[34:01.120 --> 34:09.920]  that's totally illegal but they did it and they will counter disinformation online.
[34:09.920 --> 34:14.160]  And those very groups then countered the president, countered the republican party,
[34:14.160 --> 34:22.000]  countered info wars and when people in the know like Matt Drudge were notified of this
[34:22.000 --> 34:26.600]  and told you'll be destroyed or join us, put a gun to his head basically, you saw what
[34:26.600 --> 34:28.560]  Matt Drudge did.
[34:28.560 --> 34:33.200]  Now they put the gun to my head and I didn't roll over and I'm not attacking Matt Drudge,
[34:33.200 --> 34:38.120]  he got Trump into office more than anybody else probably and was a great guy but he just
[34:38.120 --> 34:45.000]  couldn't handle it and now Drudge report is run by CNN.
[34:45.000 --> 34:50.440]  A private consortium group came in and basically bought the side out and the word is Matt
[34:50.440 --> 34:54.520]  Drudge still has a little bit of editorial control, I have that from inside sources.
[34:54.520 --> 34:58.920]  I didn't just say all that back at the time because I just pulled it out of the air and
[34:58.920 --> 35:03.320]  now you see the Twitter data dump from Musk and it's right there.
[35:03.320 --> 35:13.320]  The FBI in weekly meetings coordinating and in daily emails with huge list of who they
[35:13.320 --> 35:18.320]  wanted banned and this is when Trump's in office and it was specifically targeting
[35:18.320 --> 35:24.240]  him and Info Wars and James Woods, anybody else that they saw is truthful and effective.
[35:24.240 --> 35:30.080]  So listen, it's true, I've taken on the CIA and the FBI and the Justice Department because
[35:30.080 --> 35:34.760]  they're allowing human trafficking and smuggling and fentanyl, in fact I saw a report I didn't
[35:34.760 --> 35:40.080]  get to yesterday, we guys reprint it in San Francisco, a father let his 10 year old crawl
[35:40.080 --> 35:44.640]  around the ground at the park for just a second and the 10 month old picked up a tiny piece
[35:44.640 --> 35:55.720]  of fentanyl or licked his hands and died all over the country in blue cities.
[35:55.720 --> 36:01.160]  The Democrats, I saw a report a few weeks ago where they in San Francisco released two
[36:01.160 --> 36:12.680]  Asian men who weren't even US citizens from China who had brought in two duffel bags of
[36:12.680 --> 36:25.040]  pure fentanyl enough to kill more than 50,000 people, totally weaponized, 100 times stronger
[36:25.040 --> 36:33.820]  than heroin, yeah that's a study you guys pulled up, it was 10 month old dies at San
[36:33.820 --> 36:37.640]  Francisco playground after accidental fentanyl overdose, that's the actual headline, there
[36:37.640 --> 36:44.520]  is ABC News 7, a shock, parent speaks for 10 month old survives fentanyl overdose, the
[36:44.520 --> 36:50.440]  one I read said he died, good he didn't die, it all just blurs together, there's been
[36:50.440 --> 36:52.240]  so many.
[36:52.240 --> 37:01.560]  So what I'm getting at here is we are under total complete bombardment, we have a weaponized
[37:01.560 --> 37:06.200]  justice department that's gotten away bloody murder and now it's coming out that they were
[37:06.200 --> 37:12.040]  spying on people and censoring people in mass and meddling and involved in major election
[37:12.040 --> 37:24.440]  interference and the entire corporate media is totally ignoring it and or defending it.
[37:24.440 --> 37:30.840]  So they're just normalizing this.
[37:30.840 --> 37:39.800]  So I don't feel ashamed that my company is bankrupt, I don't feel ashamed that I'm bankrupt,
[37:39.800 --> 37:45.160]  I'm proud that I took on the new world order, I'm proud I've been in the fight 28 years
[37:45.160 --> 37:50.640]  plus, I'm proud of the effect we've all had together against the globalist that we stood
[37:50.640 --> 37:56.640]  up to them but now we're at the most important juncture in our work where we have the most
[37:56.640 --> 38:01.720]  credibility, we're having the biggest effect and it's this weird paradox where people go
[38:01.720 --> 38:06.840]  oh Alex Jones is right or Alex Jones is right and so now everything he said basically came
[38:06.840 --> 38:12.240]  true and now basically everybody else is agreeing with me and we're having a huge effect against
[38:12.240 --> 38:16.280]  the enemy but people have to understand that there's going to be the next set of globalist
[38:16.280 --> 38:21.520]  operations that I'm going to need to decipher and break down because if I don't do the analysis
[38:21.520 --> 38:27.320]  and I'm very upset about this almost no one else will because people are good at listening
[38:27.320 --> 38:31.640]  to me and going and researching it and finding out it's true and then you see and hear everything
[38:31.640 --> 38:35.400]  I break months after coming out of the mainstream.
[38:35.400 --> 38:38.640]  I don't want to be the guy that's able to figure this out, I can't believe how easy
[38:38.640 --> 38:42.280]  it is to figure out and other people can't do it but I'm the best quarterback we've
[38:42.280 --> 38:46.560]  gotten this fight and I need to stay in the damn game.
[38:46.560 --> 38:51.840]  Believe me I'm exhausted at a lot of levels I want to be able to fade away and not be
[38:51.840 --> 38:52.840]  part of the city more.
[38:52.840 --> 38:56.520]  I've done this long enough let me tell you but I can't give up because these people are
[38:56.520 --> 39:03.360]  too evil and God's watching and so I don't want the listeners to give up and to believe
[39:03.360 --> 39:08.160]  the enemy lies that oh he owes a billion and a half dollars he'll be gone when that's all
[39:08.160 --> 39:13.520]  a lie they want us gone now so we don't appeal and defeat them.
[39:13.520 --> 39:17.760]  So don't listen to their psyops you see that are put all over the newspapers across the
[39:17.760 --> 39:22.760]  country thinking you're weak minded and there's hundreds of different psyops they do and every
[39:22.760 --> 39:30.160]  single one of them is either a total lie or 90% lies and understanding propaganda against
[39:30.160 --> 39:34.640]  me is understanding propaganda against you you see this headline everywhere Alex Jones
[39:34.640 --> 39:40.960]  pays $100,000 a week to his personal trainer but won't pay his wife child support none
[39:40.960 --> 39:46.880]  of that's ex-wife none of that's true you see a secretary of state filing in Texas that
[39:46.880 --> 39:51.800]  haven't paid child support you see you get arrested in Texas for that it's not true but
[39:51.800 --> 39:57.080]  all over the country Alex Jones is a deadbeat Alex Jones doesn't pay child support that's
[39:57.080 --> 40:09.120]  a lie 100% it's the same thing I don't pay my personal trainer he's not my personal trainer
[40:09.120 --> 40:13.040]  he does have a degree in kinesiology I have known him eight years he does own a bunch
[40:13.040 --> 40:17.400]  of businesses I asked him to take over our shipping department in the interim and help
[40:17.400 --> 40:23.000]  move it to another private facility for lower prices and he's no longer even in there he
[40:23.000 --> 40:28.560]  helped transfer it in the last six months to another big national facility he has nothing
[40:28.560 --> 40:35.280]  to do with and the guy has a kinesiology degree and the guy put a gym in in our old warehouse
[40:35.280 --> 40:39.240]  for our crew to use so when they asked him when they called him into the bankruptcy court
[40:39.240 --> 40:42.440]  they said well what's your background we hear you're a personal trainer and he said well
[40:42.440 --> 40:46.880]  yeah I mean I do that and I did put a gym at the office at Alex's request and I've
[40:46.880 --> 40:51.000]  done contracting for him for years but then you read the headline Jones gives $100,000
[40:51.000 --> 40:54.560]  a week to his personal trainer so listeners hear that and think well my god he's got plenty
[40:54.560 --> 41:01.320]  of money see the psi op they ran with these PR firms they admit this is CIA level disinformation
[41:01.320 --> 41:07.800]  probably by them well how do we hurt him well what's this guy's a this guy's a kinesiologist
[41:07.800 --> 41:12.120]  we'll say that say he's Alex Jones's personal trainer and what do we do about $100,000 a
[41:12.120 --> 41:16.920]  week in shipping cost how do we make that look bad we'll just say he gives it to him
[41:16.920 --> 41:23.200]  Alex Jones pays $100,000 for personal training who the hell believes that I pay zero to Pat
[41:23.200 --> 41:31.640]  Riley for personal training I asked Pat Riley to put a gym in for our crew to use hell we
[41:31.640 --> 41:38.880]  even got an insurance discount doing it four years ago so right through those walls in
[41:38.880 --> 41:47.160]  this building is a gym for our crew with exercise machines and ellipticals and this is a basic
[41:47.160 --> 41:53.280]  gym but again you're like well there's all this news and the globals are now bombing
[41:53.280 --> 41:57.760]  Russia why are you telling this because it's it's just an example of microcosm of the level
[41:57.760 --> 42:03.640]  of their deception and how whatever you see has nothing to do with reality like that's
[42:03.640 --> 42:12.920]  a 99% a lie that I give $100,000 a week to my personal trainer yeah he's a personal trainer
[42:12.920 --> 42:17.360]  yeah he's basically a chiropractor have I begged Pat sometimes hey will you come by the
[42:17.360 --> 42:24.280]  office and will you put my hip back in joint or whatever I mean I begged him a couple weeks
[42:24.280 --> 42:27.800]  ago will you please come to the office and crank my back and get this crick I've got
[42:27.800 --> 42:31.120]  out because he does a great job better than chiropractors I've gone to you name it but
[42:31.120 --> 42:34.640]  the point is that's they turn it this whole sick thing that oh Jones got so much money
[42:34.640 --> 42:37.640]  he's been a personal trainer for $100,000 the guy took over the shipping department
[42:37.640 --> 42:42.840]  and successfully now transferred it to Denver Colorado where our shipping is so we can get
[42:42.840 --> 42:47.720]  better pricing for you and now he's not involved in it he did a job for me and they got mad
[42:47.720 --> 42:52.720]  at him so they attacked him in the national news and lied about him because they're criminal
[42:52.720 --> 43:00.720]  scum that hate you and your family and they're of their father the devil who are liars December

[47:28.120 --> 47:34.360]  that president eisenhower warned us of he'd be called a treasonous trader today the democrats
[47:34.360 --> 47:39.000]  told us the russians were meddling in our elections but they working with u.s. intelligence
[47:39.000 --> 47:50.400]  agencies were criminally illegally treasonously surveilling you and censoring you to keep their
[47:50.400 --> 47:55.640]  criminal enterprise going chanel mainstream news team reporting okay you trainer heroes
[47:55.640 --> 48:00.000]  they really showed the russians they're now shooting missiles hundreds of miles into russia
[48:00.000 --> 48:06.160]  and attacking nuclear bases how liberal how loving remember just three months ago biden
[48:06.160 --> 48:09.880]  was going to give long range missiles to ukraine ukraine promised not to use them on russia
[48:09.880 --> 48:23.000]  but biden didn't give them to him the missile go over and then boom and you hear the explosions
[48:23.000 --> 48:36.240]  come in in radio listeners can't see this but showing footage of it so here the missiles
[48:36.240 --> 48:47.840]  shoot over see the flash the distance a few seconds later you hear the blast come back
[48:47.840 --> 49:00.840]  so now ukraine is attacking deep inside russia with missiles we've got a ton of old soviet
[49:00.840 --> 49:08.200]  weapons they seem to have used modernized soviet t u one four one uavs the slight damage report
[49:08.200 --> 49:12.680]  appears to be true no visible damage on fresh satellite picks the fuel dump was blown up
[49:12.680 --> 49:18.760]  and several of the nuke bombers damaged reportedly now remember just a few weeks ago you're supposed
[49:18.760 --> 49:23.600]  to forget about it now we had to have napo attack russia immediately they fired a missile
[49:23.600 --> 49:29.160]  into poland and then it was made up it was a ukrainian missile and the russian said they
[49:29.160 --> 49:34.880]  shot it there on purpose the trajectory didn't even go towards russian planes who knows what's
[49:34.880 --> 49:39.840]  really true but we know we've been lied to over and over again by silinski but now real
[49:39.840 --> 49:45.520]  missiles fired into russia that's a good thing that's a liberal thing and the left is very
[49:45.520 --> 49:50.840]  excited about this and it's all over twitter and you name it now i'm calling for more missiles
[49:50.840 --> 49:57.640]  to be shot into russia which of course will just escalate things 10 times worse a pretty

[59:55.440 --> 01:00:09.880]  order it's alex jones do you support the chinese people's right to protest do you think it's
[01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:16.040]  problematic to do business with the communist chinese party when they suppress human rights
[01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:20.360]  have you reached out to them as a matter of national security since we obviously have
[01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:25.480]  national security concerns with china who they seem to be aiding in this process sure i don't
[01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:29.480]  have any communications to speak to specifically with apple executives so when i've told you
[01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:34.200]  over the decades that large multinational corporations ally of the dictatorships in
[01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:40.280]  the un run the leadership of the cia that's that's not my opinion and now the carney endowment
[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:46.520]  former head publicly runs it and it's come out in the news the last few months that the
[01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:52.760]  cia specifically illegally where the justice department is meeting with big tech corporate
[01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:58.040]  dinosaur legacy media and major corporations to set up the social credit score that's already
[01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:03.920]  being implemented by stealth to basically demank you harass you and later imprison you if you
[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:10.560]  don't go along with them so this is a real totalitarian takeover our democracies on both sides
[01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:16.560]  of the ocean are being shaken by the same doubts as to our ability to be sufficiently strong
[01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:22.800]  and effective when it comes to the challenges we share hate speech false information and today's
[01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:30.880]  fears to me the best way to counter the dissemination of misinformation we've got to be out there
[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:39.040]  there people who you trust who are trusted messengers to get out there and put the truth out i don't
[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:44.480]  usually read from a prepared speech but this is so important that i wanted to make sure that i got
[01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:52.400]  every single word and fact scientific fact correct before you inject your child a decision
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:58.480]  that is irreversible i wanted to let you know the scientific facts about this genetic vaccine
[01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:04.480]  which is based on the rna vaccine technology i created the first is that a viral gene will
[01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:12.080]  be injected into your parent's cells this gene forces your child's body to make toxic spike
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:20.400]  proteins it just seems to me i didn't do a study on it but from what i'm seeing uh from my experience
[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:27.520]  is that the people who are spreading misinformation and disinformation seem to be relentless in their
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:33.680]  pursuit of spreading misinformation and if you watch corporate media you'll see a cia analyst
[01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:38.800]  saying screw your free speech it doesn't exist elon musk is allowing some freedom on twitter as a
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:44.000]  russian agent putin is going to be all over twitter if there's no regulations on this
[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:51.360]  fake accounts spoofed accounts the rest of it this is a great opportunity for him and so when
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:56.400]  he's talking about the popular voice musk he's really talking about russian intelligence controlling
[01:02:56.400 --> 01:03:02.480]  what we can say is a means of controlling what we think anyone who doesn't understand the importance
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:09.600]  of protecting all speech including speech we find reprehensible is an enemy of america do you think
[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:15.360]  that users have a right to freedom of speech even if what they're saying is wrong or offensive i think
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:22.000]  that one human being should not decide how millions of people communicate with each other
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:28.160]  one human being should not be able to go into a dark room by himself and decide oh that person
[01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:34.000]  gets heard from that person doesn't that's not how it should work it says twitter provides a global
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:39.360]  communication platform which encompasses a variety of users with different voices ideas and perspectives
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:46.000]  as a policy we do not mediate content or intervene in disputes between users this is all just the
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:51.680]  first amendment law and they say down here if you believe content or behavior reporting is prohibited
[01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:56.240]  in your local jurisdiction please contact your local authorities this is the slide of hand that
[01:03:56.240 --> 01:04:03.680]  the establishment has done is they've equated free speech with hate speech so if you're for free
[01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:10.320]  speech you're against minority groups because then people will be able to hurl hate speech at them
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:16.800]  and so you should be against free speech because it hurts minority groups the only thing minority
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:23.280]  groups have is their speech words can be weapons hate speech online can lead to cruelty and violence
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:29.280]  in real life the un report says ban people's speech because it might make somebody do something bad
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:34.400]  when they flood our countries with third world populations filled with hate for us if you criticize
[01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:39.760]  it you get arrested markets like actually totalitarian governments where you have a
[01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:44.560]  understanding of what's out there and obviously we're the whole dimension is changing now with
[01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:50.880]  uh as he said a democratization of of countries and and democracies are very messy as we know in
[01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:56.560]  the united states uh you have opinions changing so this is the control ladies and gentlemen
[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:07.440]  december 2022 is here and we are proud and very excited to announce that free shipping is back

[01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:25.600]  well you have found it the undoubted undisputed tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty
[01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:32.320]  against the new world order i'm your host Alex Jones and i wanted to get hotep jesus on a really
[01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:39.360]  smart commentator i wanted to get him on today because there is just so much to talk about so
[01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:48.560]  much to break down dealing with the yeh the Kanye west interview that happened on thursday that
[01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:53.520]  undoubtedly has probably a billion views out there or more it's from every tv station
[01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:58.800]  and basically every commentator's talked about it everything from saturday night live to see an end
[01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:05.200]  and they misrepresented a lot of what was said i'm not defending some of the things that yeh did
[01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:10.640]  say here on air but the issue is is that our own government brought 30 plus thousand nazis back
[01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:15.200]  of the world war two to help set up the modern system at eisenhower warned about the military
[01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:19.600]  industrial complex and we have infanticide and humans smuggling across the borders and all this
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:26.080]  going on and obviously yeh did is be provocative and to really plant his foot on the first amendment
[01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:34.400]  and and and plant his flag there uh but there's a lot of angles to this and a lot of areas that
[01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:40.560]  need to be looked at and i've been watching the commentary of hotep jesus uh quite a bit
[01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:47.280]  and i wanted to get him on with me today uh to basically relate some of his views that i think
[01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:52.880]  are spot on uh to our audience so hotep good to have you with us hey thank you man i let's start
[01:07:52.880 --> 01:08:00.240]  right here uh there's no such thing as hate speech full stop there is no such thing as hate speech
[01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:09.840]  speech needs somebody to interpret it therefore hate speech is subjected uh canon hotep spoke
[01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:17.920]  about this on his uh feed today and really what it takes is on one side somebody says one thing
[01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:23.680]  somebody dislikes it but there's probably a group of people on the other side who agree with it when
[01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:29.520]  we look at speech held at black people people might describe me as a black man african-american
[01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:37.280]  etc etc and let's say this is some white nationalist group nazi or whatever they identify as and uh
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:46.640]  they have some gripes with my people people like me people of my skin color i care i care about what
[01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:52.800]  they have to say because i truly understand that their problem isn't with me there's some sort of
[01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:59.040]  shortcoming happening in their life and i happen to be the scapegoat so let's look let's look at
[01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:07.040]  yay last week in his comments yay if you watched the beginning of the series with you and then
[01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:14.800]  you watch the end of uh of that broadcast you see two different people what happened when yay
[01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:19.920]  went to other platforms they were cutting them off they were silencing they were disagreeing with
[01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:25.520]  them but they weren't allowed him to get what he wanted off of his chest what you often find is
[01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:32.640]  if you give people room to breathe give people room to vent what happens they start to capitulate
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:39.200]  they start to even out they start to be a little bit kinder and we saw that with yay where he's you
[01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:45.280]  know he basically was spreading a message of love by the end of that interview this is what happens
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:51.360]  when you let people speak and you find out that it's not hate speech it's actually venting do we
[01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:56.960]  really want to get to the core of what's wrong for example when we look at racism in the south
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:03.360]  although i don't condone it and the acts of that and have been done against my people i do understand
[01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:10.640]  that certain concessions were made after the civil war that angered whites especially poor whites
[01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:16.480]  and they saw some sort of unfair treatment really what we're dealing with is there seems to be some
[01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:21.040]  arbiter some people call it the government some people call it deep state whatever you want to
[01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:27.600]  call it i don't know i don't i don't live on that level of this building but there's some arbiter
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:34.400]  and this arbiter is the one who's defining what hate speech is hate speech does not need i mean
[01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:40.320]  speech does not need an arbiter when we talk about the first amendment the first amendment was absolute
[01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:48.400]  and it was created to protect so-called hate speech if we didn't have the ability to vent
[01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:53.360]  our gripes with groups of individuals nobody would know it so for example we talk about white
[01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:59.680]  nationalist or so-called hate groups what happens when you don't allow them a space to vent well
[01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:06.000]  they go into hiding and that's the last thing you want somebody who has vitriol to do is to go into
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:10.160]  hiding someplace where you can't see them now they start plotting and then you have terrorist
[01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:16.480]  events etc etc however if you said listen we hear you you have some certain gripes towards certain
[01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:22.080]  people why don't we give you a platform to express those gripes and then we open up conversation
[01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:26.800]  you see the same thing happens in relationships you often find that relationships between men and
[01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:32.560]  women and you know marriage whatever it may be they tend to fall apart when there's a breakdown
[01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:39.600]  and communication zero communication or lack of communication however if both sides truly vent
[01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:44.080]  what their problem is and the other side wants to listen this is the this is the other part of
[01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:50.000]  this argument that needs to be had one side needs to vent and the other side needs to listen
[01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:56.400]  they probably teach this in marriage counseling what happens is one side vents their side and the
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:12:00.400]  other side wants to vent their side and now you have two people yelling at each other two groups
[01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:06.880]  yelling at each other no one side needs to vent and the other side needs to listen and that's
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:12.160]  what people in america have a problem doing what happens is they react to these things
[01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:18.960]  oh with their emotions and not their mind they don't really analyze they don't use logic when
[01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:25.600]  people speak all they do is say I don't like what you said my feelings are hurt why why why why
[01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:32.640]  why we saw that with the left you know the right had certain opinions certain ideologies trump
[01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:38.960]  said certain things and all we heard was why why why why then yay gets on alex jones platform the
[01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:46.960]  greatest platform on earth and what happened why why why why from everybody all across the aisle
[01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:53.920]  i was surprised to see so many people who claimed free speech all of a sudden weren't for free
[01:12:53.920 --> 01:13:02.320]  speech now before we dive down that rabbit hole the first amendment was supposed to protect us from
[01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:09.120]  the government the government is supposed to say you have the right to speak but you know what today
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:17.600]  government's not the problem we are you are i am well definitely not me because i'm a free
[01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:25.120]  speech absolutionist but when people speak we're ready to respond with vitriol we're ready to condemn
[01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:31.120]  we don't listen anymore when i see people get on the internet and they spread their opinions whether
[01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:36.960]  i agree with them or not it doesn't affect my life it doesn't take food out of my children's mouth it
[01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:42.880]  doesn't affect me so i say oh well that's that person's opinion why do i need to express my
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:48.640]  opinion on somebody else's opinion that's what i want to know why is it when yay speaks everybody
[01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:55.120]  has to pick up their phone and say something do you realize that he would be impotent if nobody
[01:13:55.120 --> 01:14:00.480]  reacted this is the lesson he's trying to teach you he's like you guys can't help but to react so
[01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:07.520]  what do you think his main goal was coming here and doing what he did he wants people to look in
[01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:16.960]  the mirror and see how hypocritical they truly are you are a hypocrite he wants people to see that
[01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:23.920]  on one hand right what happened oh i wore the white lives matter shirt and everybody said oh
[01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:30.160]  yay we love it let him speak and then he said something about another group of people and now
[01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:35.040]  all of a sudden we have to cancel him this is hypocritical this is bigotry and he wants to
[01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:42.320]  point that out he wants to point out how easily people are disturbed i think his real goal is to
[01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:49.680]  filter out who's with him and who's not he went to the white lives matter side filtered a lot of
[01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:55.280]  people out then he went this alternate route filtered even more people out he's trying to see
[01:14:55.840 --> 01:15:04.080]  who's really real who stands on their own ideologies morals the things that they say we're
[01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:08.240]  gonna go to break but but i want to tie this into elon musket now the twitter files coming out
[01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:13.520]  that prove the government illegally election meddling all of it but you know elon said i'm a
[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:20.640]  free speech absolutist but now he's not with myself or yay or anybody else and then he he he
[01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:25.760]  supports the azab battalion literally doing hitler rituals on twitter i'm gonna show this when we
[01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:32.960]  come back but then yay puts up a ralian symbol of unification of the swastika and the star of david

[01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:20.640]  so what's really going on with elon musk he says he's for free speech or free speech
[01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:25.520]  absolutists i wasn't banned off of twitter for saying he wasn't being discussed and i was banned
[01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:30.160]  they just hyped that up basically exaggerated made it all up before they sued me with a big pr
[01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:35.520]  firm they hired but he said no no alex jones is the worst he said he didn't get to come back and then
[01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:42.560]  with yay formerly connie west he posed a picture of a star of day with a swastika in the middle
[01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:49.040]  it's a new age railing and flying saucer cult out of france's symbol as just a test and he gets banned
[01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:56.000]  on friday night and so what's really going on with elon here's a short clip of elon having
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:01.680]  a chat uh that was public that wasn't promoted uh saturday where he talks about wanting to punch
[01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:09.360]  connie for i i i guess not just posting the symbol but what he said on my show it was like
[01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:15.040]  uh you know where that was my decision but i think it's important that people know okay that was my
[01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:20.720]  decision um because at a certain point you have to say what is incitement to violence because that
[01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:25.760]  is against the law in the u.s. if you can't just have a you know form a club uh let's go murder
[01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:32.240]  someone club um you know that's not actually legal so uh the question is what is incitement to violence
[01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:40.320]  and i think um you know postings swastikas in what is obviously not a you know good way uh is
[01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:45.280]  an assignment to violence i personally wanted to punch uh connie so uh that would definitely
[01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:52.720]  inciting meat of violence um so uh you know right that's not cool just hang on but you mentioned
[01:21:52.720 --> 01:22:00.880]  in a good way well no it's just that like to make something like an analysis of the second world war
[01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:07.120]  or something you know uh that's a history drama whatever you know it's context yeah yeah it's
[01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:13.520]  like it's like okay you know like let's live a battlefield or something and that's good you know
[01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:21.440]  this this you know uh this is some sort of you know uh war history thing i don't know yeah something
[01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:27.120]  like that then that that would be okay but um it has to become sexual i mean if he's posting it in a
[01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:32.400]  way that is trying to rally people who are into some of the views then yeah yeah i mean it's like
[01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:37.680]  you can also like say like okay well let's look for added context outside of twitter to say to
[01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:43.680]  say like well was this meant in a in a friendly way and it's like okay well no he's saying that he
[01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:50.640]  likes hitla and uh other things and look at the point at which alex jones is like telling kanya to
[01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:58.080]  to calm down and and you know please please stop you have to say okay you know you know alex jones
[01:22:58.080 --> 01:23:05.120]  is pretty edgy so uh like alex jones is saying kanya wants to kanya to stop that's that's a big deal
[01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:11.920]  so anyway the but i want to get into like some sort of huge like it's just could easily get
[01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:17.840]  derailed into you know i've already agreed yeah we could talk talk more about the file so you
[01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:24.640]  mentioned that you gave it to a very okay so i want to be clear my disagreeing with yay
[01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:29.040]  of what he's being provocative is different than wanting to punch him in the face which i
[01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:35.120]  didn't want to or censoring him so what elon just admitted was he banned him for on for off
[01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:41.760]  platform activity on my show and then he put out a symbol of swastika with a star of david
[01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:47.360]  and said that was incitement to violence this is a fraud what elon just said
[01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:55.600]  oh tap what do you say yeah totally again this is what yay wanted to expose he wanted to expose
[01:23:55.600 --> 01:24:01.760]  the hypocrisy where somebody is being applauded for being uh a proponent of free speech and yet
[01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:10.160]  here we have a guy who won't re-platform alex jones and uh de-platformed yay let's look at elon
[01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:16.880]  uh some of the decisions that elon is making regarding this shows me how powerful elon is
[01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:22.960]  not uh it's powerful enough to buy twitter he's not powerful enough to run twitter how it should
[01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:31.440]  be run uh the symbol that yay posted like you said from a reallion association uh therefore
[01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:38.720]  elon never did uh any research on to uh you know that symbol to see what it represented
[01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:42.560]  uh also you know what are you going to you're going to cancel buddha because he's got a swash
[01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:46.640]  to go on his stomach like is that where we at right now are we going to ignore the history
[01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:53.360]  behind this symbol outside of the uh the the idea of it in world war two are we going to ban
[01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:59.600]  the yin yang next so there's that piece but i think this might have been personal um i think
[01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:08.480]  because um yay won't bow down to the power of elon elon said oh you're testing me you know
[01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:14.880]  f around and find out that's what he posted uh after he suspended yay so this is more of
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:21.600]  an ego battle where elon is saying how dare you challenge me in front of the world and put
[01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:27.760]  him me on the spot elon is feeling the pressure of the powers that be he's not fighting them
[01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:32.160]  if he was fighting them he'd be managing the platform definitely for example when we look
[01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:37.120]  at the twitter files it was very i was very unimpressed by the twitter files let's just be
[01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:44.880]  honest um yes um some things did support some of the arguments we were making about collusion
[01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:50.400]  between the government and big tech yes we know about this we have the evidence now great however
[01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:57.360]  you know we didn't have we didn't have the full string of emails why wasn't this stuff exposed
[01:25:57.360 --> 01:26:02.960]  wiki leak style why was it given to one journalist and i think you know matt did a good job you know
[01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:08.000]  of making this thing into a story type thread for the masses no exactly why doesn't he just dump
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:13.760]  him to the whole public why didn't why didn't he dump him to the public exactly remember what
[01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:19.360]  remember what what what fredo said remember what fredo said interrupt fredo uh chris kwomo
[01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:23.600]  and cnn said like five years ago journalists can look at wiki leaks you're not allowed to
[01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:31.120]  as a public how condescending and that's exactly what elon just did was a chris kwomo well that's
[01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:39.520]  exactly it okay so matt he brings it out storybook style but this is an insult to our intelligence
[01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:46.240]  basically saying we have to feed this to them like dr seuss why not give it to us wiki leak style
[01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:52.800]  like 2016 and allow all the journalists all the independent media to go and dive into the files
[01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:57.680]  however i know there may be some sensitive things in there but your team should have gone through
[01:26:57.680 --> 01:27:02.960]  redacted some of the sensitive materials but did a full dump when i heard the title so this was
[01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:08.880]  marketing right when you say twitter files but we don't get twitter files what we got were twitter
[01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:14.160]  screenshots you should have called we get filtered through matt taimi well what we got was filtered
[01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:21.760]  filtered pap it was filtered and i was unimpressed and people said hotel how could you how could you
[01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:28.080]  say that that i'm like you're insulting my intelligence i want the full dump i want the full emails so
[01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:34.080]  if i were to figure out why didn't elon give us the full dump well it's probably because he's scared
[01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:41.840]  it's probably because he's afraid to upset the deep state what some people have speculated in my
[01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:50.880]  twitter feed is that this was more of a blackmail type situation i'm saying look i got this don't
[01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:56.320]  mess with me i could do a full dump but he didn't want to do the full dump yet so this isn't about
[01:27:56.320 --> 01:28:01.520]  the truth this isn't about the people this is about elon saying you got to attacking me in my
[01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:06.720]  platform i can attack back this is a personal thing between elon and the deep state has nothing to
[01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:11.920]  do with freedom and in truth and i think elon's warning in on the deep state i think he's not
[01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:17.280]  trying to free things overall i think he's trying to take it over yes but but also look how trump's
[01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:23.760]  name was implicated in this situation big like so matt decided to put that one thing about oh trump
[01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:29.440]  called in so this is also destabilizing trump's platform this isn't about freedom this isn't
[01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:36.720]  you know uh bipartisan this is uh uh elon thing all right hotep jesus hotep jesus.com where you

[01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:40.640]  i want to show this tweet here that really was probably the thing that got gay band it's uh
[01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:52.240]  uh a manual the big hollywood kingpin on a yacht this year spring elon off uh there and let's always
[01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:59.040]  remember this is my final tweet said yay is that really what's going on is that really what is
[01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:03.360]  angered elon but i want to play this because a lot of people pointed this out the azob battalions
[01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:09.760]  are the main shop troop military of ukraine those who don't know world war two got fought a lot of
[01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:16.640]  it between the russians and the nazis once operation barba rosa started uh ian ukraine
[01:34:16.640 --> 01:34:22.240]  and so the western part was nazi the eastern part was russian and that was some of the biggest
[01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:27.520]  battles and millions dead there and so zolensky got questioned earlier this year about the nazi
[01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:32.560]  affiliation of the azob attack and he said yeah they are they are that's because they all have
[01:34:32.560 --> 01:34:39.680]  swastikas and twin thunderbolts on them they hail hitler they worship hitler and hitler was
[01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:45.600]  not a christian he was an occultist uh kind of followed kind of a norse religion and they had
[01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:50.240]  a blood and soil ritual where they would cut themselves then go into a false grave in the
[01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:55.200]  soil and bleed into the ground and put all their blood into it and that was a ritual the s s did
[01:34:55.920 --> 01:35:02.400]  and so you go to the official ukrainian websites on or government websites on twitter they actually
[01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:06.720]  show their rituals them hailing hitler we're going to show you footage of this with audio guys
[01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:12.000]  we're playing here in a moment it's only 44 seconds of them worshiping odin which i'm not saying
[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:16.240]  that's bad if you like odin that's not nazi that's but it's a blood blood and soil ritual
[01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:23.120]  carving runes in their arms of twin lightning bolts and going into a grave and and putting
[01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:28.160]  their hand into all the other blood of others that have been through this blood and soil death
[01:35:28.160 --> 01:35:33.200]  ritual you'll notice when they go and put their hands on odin they got swastikas on their arms
[01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:38.320]  so so my point is elon says he's gonna ban something if the swastika promotes violence but
[01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:43.040]  yay didn't do that but here are actual nazis doing a death ritual before they go to battle
[01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:51.520]  and using the swastika for the symbol of their flag going into war which is violence so here
[01:35:51.520 --> 01:36:07.440]  here's what twitter allows versus versus what they did to get here it is
[01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:37.440]  so
[01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:42.160]  all right so back that up 10 seconds show the guy putting his hand on odin with the big
[01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:47.280]  swastikas arms my point is these are real nazis a government run military in a war
[01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:52.240]  or leftovers of world war two like you don't get more nazi on the whole planet it's like
[01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:56.720]  saying well that's a purebred pit bull that's a purebred german shepherder that's a purebred
[01:36:56.720 --> 01:37:03.520]  chihuahua like this this is the real mccoy okay it's like saying uh tom brady's the quarterback
[01:37:03.520 --> 01:37:09.360]  like who's the best in a bell quarterback tom brady like this is the purebred this is what it is
[01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:14.400]  and and like just like george soros actually rounded up jews but he's loved because he's a jew
[01:37:14.400 --> 01:37:19.280]  that rounded up jews it's sick so they point it yeah and say he's the ultimate nazi i think his
[01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:25.760]  point was to call all the south what do you make of this hotep reminds me of world war two when you
[01:37:25.760 --> 01:37:32.400]  had uh corporations like standard oil giving out the hydrogenation process to the nazis
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:41.120]  you had wall street back in the nazis so what do we have in a day we have the same money guys
[01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:47.840]  controlling communism right because germany dealt with uh socialist uprising communist
[01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:54.320]  uprising just like russia did so this is the same same playbook same game plan and what they do
[01:37:54.320 --> 01:38:00.000]  is these money manipulators use communism and now the the communists what they're saying is
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:06.480]  you got to support the war in ukraine everybody's rocking uh you know the yellow and blue flag and
[01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:12.480]  then that's the consensus support ukraine if you don't you're a bad person forget the point just
[01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:19.040]  completely ignore those nazis be mad at yay who's not an actual nazi but these nazis over here
[01:38:19.040 --> 01:38:27.920]  oh let's send them javelins let's send them money let's send them um war material that is the
[01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:37.040]  common consensus now and this is what elan is subject to elan has to follow the mainstream
[01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:43.440]  narrative to a certain extent at some point he can deviate but he knows where that line is drawn
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:49.920]  so right now we have the a's off battalion still exists on twitter they want to completely ignore
[01:38:49.920 --> 01:38:55.600]  if you go look at the previous publishing by mainstream media before the war started many
[01:38:55.600 --> 01:39:00.720]  years ago they say there is a nazi presence in ukraine so what's the long game here well the
[01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:06.320]  long game here is they're gonna arm them just like they are in the tally band al-qaeda all these
[01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:12.400]  different organizations are gonna arm them war and and then a few years later they're gonna come
[01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:17.600]  back and say oh man there's nazis in ukraine we have to go back in ukraine we have to get rid of
[01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:23.840]  the nazis this is the long-term gameplay exactly that's what's gonna happen and then we'll be back
[01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:28.880]  in that war and everybody and then what they'll do is they'll even ignore the fact that everybody
[01:39:28.880 --> 01:39:32.320]  warned them and said you know we're arming nazis you know there's nazi everybody's gonna
[01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:36.800]  act like we didn't know this everybody's gonna act like this wasn't said and then they're gonna
[01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:42.720]  make everybody support a war in ukraine that's anti-nazi and then you recycle rinse and repeat
[01:39:42.720 --> 01:39:49.520]  and turn this into a new land for some other people i agree so what do you make of yesterday
[01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:54.240]  cruise missiles fired out of ukraine and now admitted attacking russian military bases 100
[01:39:54.240 --> 01:39:58.320]  plus miles inside russia a major escalation let's roll it with audio here it is
[01:40:02.240 --> 01:40:03.200]  missile flies over
[01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:08.160]  you see the explosion and then the second slider of the sound comes back
[01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:22.560]  boom see the explosion and then now here comes the sound so now our media is cheerleading
[01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:27.280]  ukraine firing missiles deep into russia why is this not a good idea maybe it is a good idea
[01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:36.000]  oh top um you know i couldn't answer that question i'm not exactly sure what i can say is ukraine
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:42.400]  can do no wrong the media who controls the general narrative is going to spin things however they
[01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:48.080]  want to see it they spun the last two years into being something that it wasn't it turned out people
[01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:54.720]  died suddenly um ukraine can for example when we dealt with uh what was the name of north stream
[01:40:54.720 --> 01:41:01.040]  pipeline right you know your one hand you got biden saying hey yeah we can shut this thing down
[01:41:01.040 --> 01:41:06.800]  whenever we want and then the thing gets shut down and everybody's like oh no putin did it right
[01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:12.080]  so it depends on who controls the megaphone and that is the narrative you got to go along with
[01:41:12.080 --> 01:41:17.760]  what i suggest people do is study history because all these things have parallels all these things
[01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:23.040]  are like reruns and then make the decision up to yourself but if the media says go left you
[01:41:23.040 --> 01:41:28.400]  probably want to go right and if they say go right you probably want to go left i agree so let me
[01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:33.200]  ask you then the last segment's coming up we got some time left what about culture in general are
[01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:38.800]  you hopeful are you white-pilled uh are you black-pilled are you red-pilled i mean where are you
[01:41:38.800 --> 01:41:46.560]  white-pilled i'm white-pilled you know these people are are sloppy look at the whole hunder
[01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:51.520]  biden situation they couldn't keep that under wraps uh look at the last two years they couldn't
[01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:58.720]  keep that under wraps they couldn't keep the wiggy league situation where hillary uh under wraps they're
[01:41:58.720 --> 01:42:06.720]  sloppy also if you look at the last two years that massive push to push an agenda extremely fast
[01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:13.360]  and accelerated to me was a signal of panic i had to accelerate their control so that's why i'm
[01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:17.680]  white-pilled because what i i don't see are people who aren't controlled what i see are people who are
[01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:23.040]  trying to make sure they maintain control or increase their control but the last two years
[01:42:23.040 --> 01:42:29.440]  were so sloppy and done at such an accelerated rate it proves that they're in panic mode i suggest
[01:42:29.440 --> 01:42:35.280]  everybody else out there be extremely white-pilled uh we will win we are winning every single day
[01:42:35.280 --> 01:42:38.960]  and there's nothing they can do to stop us i agree with you in fact i'm going to take this last
[01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:42.960]  minute clip guys when we post this interview may not video of hoechep right there about he's white
[01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:49.440]  build i want that up front except there's a bad side of this and i'll explain when we come back
[01:42:49.440 --> 01:42:54.800]  what about i'm gonna introduce the term dead build talk about dead build we'll be right back
[01:42:58.960 --> 01:43:05.360]  it's hard to believe sometimes that we are still live on air broadcasting free worldwide
[01:43:05.360 --> 01:43:13.440]  and it seems quite real that things can change in an instant things are getting very weird
[01:43:13.440 --> 01:43:19.360]  and it's definitely more difficult than ever to even know what's going on but we'll keep doing our
[01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:27.360]  best so long as you keep us on the air and you can do that now at infowarstore.com help us clear
[01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:34.560]  out our stock of bodies tumor vitamin c with zinc and alpha power turn those shady federal reserve

[01:43:43.520 --> 01:43:49.920]  we thank you for your support and we wish you a very peaceful happy and merry christmas
[01:43:49.920 --> 01:44:05.760]  and i think we watched the election be stolen slowly stolen day by day counting these mail-in
[01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:13.440]  ballots and it's absolutely absurd for anyone to take our election seriously when we we just
[01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:19.120]  it's election month alex it's not election day and that's the problem and everything
[01:44:19.120 --> 01:44:26.240]  changed after covid-19 they illegally changed state elections mailing ballots to anyone and
[01:44:26.240 --> 01:44:31.680]  everyone and sometimes mailing multiple ballots to people well this isn't any way to run an
[01:44:31.680 --> 01:44:36.320]  election we're in a serious country when we have elections that can be stolen like this
[01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:41.280]  and i believe that just like i believe the election was stolen in 2020 and i have no
[01:44:41.280 --> 01:44:46.480]  problem saying that and it's it is so absurd for the media and the democrats to attack us
[01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:53.360]  that question our election integrity and question the the fact that elections um shouldn't be run

[01:47:00.880 --> 01:47:09.680]  assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[01:47:31.200 --> 01:47:40.720]  all right what is dead pill the word i just the term i just invented
[01:47:41.920 --> 01:47:45.440]  well you got white pill where you got a good vision of the future you eat black pill where
[01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:48.560]  you've given up you think everything's over red pill means you're awake what's going on
[01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:54.080]  they kind of say once you become a red pill are you gonna be black pilled or white pilled and i'm
[01:47:54.080 --> 01:48:00.000]  overall white pilled but that's if people keep waking up and keep standing up and if we can get
[01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:04.480]  the establishment to realize how crazy they are as well and back off because they're going to keep
[01:48:04.480 --> 01:48:10.800]  doubling down with their moves for control and power and keep me stabilizing so the more they lose
[01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:16.880]  the more radical and dangerous they get and so if we have a nuclear war and it kills half the
[01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:22.080]  population of the world we go back to another dark age or kills everybody that's extinction
[01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:26.640]  pilled that's black pilled so hope if i agree with you i'm overall white pilled currently
[01:48:26.640 --> 01:48:32.880]  about the state of the awakening and the desperateness of the establishment but it's got that it's got
[01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:38.960]  that other side to it though that they could escalate and release a super virus and or or god
[01:48:38.960 --> 01:48:45.360]  knows what and dead pill us so your view on what i just rolled out here that's going to work against
[01:48:45.360 --> 01:48:51.760]  them that is absolutely going to work against them so for example when i speak about black folks
[01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:57.120]  you know the one thing i say is it's easy to organize a small amount of people than it is a
[01:48:57.120 --> 01:49:04.320]  large amount of people and there's a lot of black people on this planet when you consider the diaspora
[01:49:04.320 --> 01:49:10.000]  in africa etc etc so therefore it's really hard to organize even on the african continent because
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:14.400]  there's so many different views if they were to reduce the population of the united states
[01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:21.520]  or the world it's going to work against them and in fact um this is like the whole Thanos
[01:49:21.520 --> 01:49:25.520]  theory right like you reduce the population and things get better that's actually what'll happen
[01:49:25.520 --> 01:49:32.400]  like if they reduce the population things would get better if they in fact i always said in order
[01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:39.360]  for people to really get red pill red pilled you're going to need to cut off their um their their
[01:49:39.360 --> 01:49:44.720]  their so so for example united states we have this uh what do you call it standard of living
[01:49:44.720 --> 01:49:51.200]  this high standard of living once that's threatened all you can expect a lot of people to be red pill
[01:49:51.200 --> 01:49:56.400]  once that tv stops working you know once the supermarket isn't stopped you're going to have
[01:49:56.400 --> 01:50:01.280]  people start to organize like what's the thing that stops people from being organized right now
[01:50:01.280 --> 01:50:08.640]  isn't it media sports and entertainment so if the nfl stops and mba stops etc etc people have no
[01:50:08.640 --> 01:50:13.680]  choice but to start organizing what the people with these big organizations of three letter
[01:50:13.680 --> 01:50:19.280]  agencies etc etc have over is that they're organized and the people are unorganized so if they try to
[01:50:19.280 --> 01:50:26.080]  reduce the population all the deals they'll push us towards um towards organizations so instead
[01:50:26.080 --> 01:50:30.320]  what they do is they try to chop their heads off the snake they try to chop the head like for example
[01:50:30.320 --> 01:50:35.840]  yay alex jones these are the heads of the snake and they want to chop their heads off you are a
[01:50:35.840 --> 01:50:40.720]  hundred percent right that's it because a lot of their attacks are counterintuitive they want to
[01:50:40.720 --> 01:50:45.280]  dumb down mass of servants but they need us to operate even robots in our places but then
[01:50:45.280 --> 01:50:50.560]  they also have these dumb down decadent masses uh that are they're totally brainwashing worthless
[01:50:50.560 --> 01:50:54.880]  for them and we know that the black plague killed half the population of europe and caused the
[01:50:54.880 --> 01:50:59.360]  renaissance after that because it shook up the establishment knocked out the elites and made
[01:50:59.360 --> 01:51:03.840]  human labor more valuable but also made the survivors get together and be more hardcore
[01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:11.280]  absolutely i mean look at my my brand for example you know if it wasn't for the bosses that
[01:51:11.280 --> 01:51:18.720]  deal with me guffeld alex um tempul rogan if it wasn't for you guys nobody would know who i am
[01:51:18.720 --> 01:51:25.680]  i'm severely deboosted on instagram facebook has banned me from advertising i can't even give facebook
[01:51:25.680 --> 01:51:31.440]  money and the funny thing is i don't use facebook so i don't even know why i'm bad but they said i
[01:51:31.440 --> 01:51:35.040]  broke some rule but i'm like i'm gonna use your platform how i've been so obviously somebody up
[01:51:35.040 --> 01:51:40.560]  there didn't like who i am and then shut off my account so i can't even boost posts there well
[01:51:40.560 --> 01:51:45.600]  yeah but they're also banning people talking about you so that's what that ban means well yeah
[01:51:45.600 --> 01:51:50.560]  absolutely um so they're not just censoring you they're censoring other people's opinions
[01:51:50.560 --> 01:51:56.080]  by the millions of you so so let's do this who i really feel sorry for is i see what they've done
[01:51:56.080 --> 01:51:59.920]  to all the impoverished communities we know the black community they admit it's a model of what
[01:51:59.920 --> 01:52:04.000]  they would do to everybody else i love seeing black folks break free because because that's the real
[01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:08.080]  canary in the coal mine and i love everybody because i understand if we don't all win together
[01:52:08.080 --> 01:52:12.720]  we're gonna fall together as benjamin franklin said but this this whole movement of be obese
[01:52:12.720 --> 01:52:18.480]  be unhealthy commit suicide be as nihilistic as possible why would the system push that
[01:52:18.480 --> 01:52:22.640]  on a population because all it's gonna do is create another group that season gets more
[01:52:22.640 --> 01:52:26.880]  hardcore as you said and then wipe out their own supporters here's a few of these clips of just the
[01:52:26.880 --> 01:52:35.680]  most saddening mind control ever here it is just a reminder that i am very fat and very sexy and i am
[01:52:35.680 --> 01:52:43.520]  a hundred percent glorifying obesity and there's nothing you can do about it hi you are not body
[01:52:43.520 --> 01:52:51.040]  positive if you are not anti-racist you can't be body positive if you're not anti-racist if you
[01:52:51.040 --> 01:52:56.240]  want to engage in and benefit from and profit off of this space and you want it to just be about
[01:52:56.240 --> 01:53:01.280]  loving your roles and cellulay and stretch marks you are at the tip of the iceberg and you've missed
[01:53:01.280 --> 01:53:07.920]  the entire point body positivity is meant for us to get at the root of the bullshit that we have
[01:53:07.920 --> 01:53:15.120]  been taught and guess what that phobia is very much rooted in racism like big time like seriously
[01:53:15.120 --> 01:53:20.720]  also black women totally paved the way for us in this space here so if you care about the stuff
[01:53:20.720 --> 01:53:28.320]  now is not the time to be silent okay this is not just about you learning to love your body
[01:53:28.320 --> 01:53:34.720]  this is about all of us dismantling systems that make it impossible for people to just be safe in
[01:53:34.720 --> 01:53:40.080]  their bodies and that means following up with action okay so let me analyze that get your take on it
[01:53:40.080 --> 01:53:43.920]  i'm a little overweight because i'm a big stocky guy but i work out and you know i've had my heart
[01:53:43.920 --> 01:53:50.720]  checked i actually have low blood pressure uh for my age i'm i'm doing good but i could be better but
[01:53:50.720 --> 01:53:57.040]  to say body positivity if she needs to be healthier people say hey weigh in 400 pounds 500 pounds when
[01:53:57.040 --> 01:54:02.640]  you're five four it's not healthy she's saying no you're being racist to me why is the system promoting
[01:54:02.640 --> 01:54:08.160]  it and you see these slaves because they're in healthiness literally celebrating their slavery
[01:54:08.160 --> 01:54:14.160]  this is the mind control for me hotel it's definitely my control in fact what it is is it's
[01:54:14.160 --> 01:54:21.440]  homogeneity of the mind um getting people to all think alike you see once everybody thinks alike
[01:54:21.440 --> 01:54:26.160]  then you only have to intercept one group of people with your programming and control and
[01:54:26.160 --> 01:54:30.480]  everybody goes along with the mass and the jab and it spreads etc etc but when you have many
[01:54:30.480 --> 01:54:36.320]  different types of groups who think many different things at that point it's much harder to control
[01:54:36.320 --> 01:54:41.040]  because now you have to infect thousands of different groups thousands of different organizations
[01:54:41.040 --> 01:54:46.080]  but if what they can do is if they can cloud the conversation for example if they can say
[01:54:46.080 --> 01:54:50.560]  there's no longer such thing as racism in fact fat phobia is racism and if you don't
[01:54:50.560 --> 01:54:55.120]  faith like uh like fat people then you're also transphobic and if you don't like trans people
[01:54:55.120 --> 01:54:59.280]  then you don't like black people so what they're trying to do is they're trying to lump everything
[01:54:59.280 --> 01:55:06.320]  all into the same ideology to create that homogeneity and group everyone together you know the whole
[01:55:06.320 --> 01:55:12.560]  victim narrative victim olympics etc etc now the next part of the next part of this is
[01:55:13.280 --> 01:55:19.760]  communists need the minority to exploit they take a look at groups that are underserved
[01:55:19.760 --> 01:55:24.960]  under representative and they exploit their problems and then they weaponize them against
[01:55:24.960 --> 01:55:33.200]  other groups of people notice that this fat woman isn't upset at uh mcdonald's for making her fat
[01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:38.160]  she's mad at us because we don't want to date her she would have you flashed back a hundred years
[01:55:38.160 --> 01:55:43.680]  nobody existed with this type of size now you look around and everybody exists like this because of
[01:55:43.680 --> 01:55:50.480]  the emergence of synthetic foods and people say oh the FDA approved this and that well the FDA also
[01:55:50.480 --> 01:55:56.080]  approves many synthetic foods fake foods that other countries would not even take a second
[01:55:56.080 --> 01:56:00.800]  that's what they're feeding us poison to depopulate us and they're making the slaves of it love it
[01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:04.480]  and say don't tell me to be healthier you're being racist when we're trying to help them
[01:56:05.520 --> 01:56:13.280]  yes but you got to add the part about the homogenous mind see depopulation doesn't work
[01:56:13.280 --> 01:56:19.360]  unless everybody thinks the same and unless everybody is a victim they don't want people
[01:56:19.360 --> 01:56:24.720]  to feel empowered they want people to feel victim why so that the bolsheviks can then be
[01:56:24.720 --> 01:56:29.680]  their hero and then they look to somebody else they look outwards people in the self-help area
[01:56:29.680 --> 01:56:33.200]  always talk about this do you going to take empowerment of your own life you're going to blame
[01:56:33.200 --> 01:56:36.400]  your problems and somebody else and they fear somebody taking power of their lives they're
[01:56:36.400 --> 01:56:41.360]  telling them every affliction we've got that we should try to get out of no no no celebrate it
[01:56:41.360 --> 01:56:47.440]  in another 50 pounds this is pure evil hotep you're a genius hotepjesus.com really appreciate

[01:57:04.320 --> 01:57:07.920]  if you really want to understand what happens in this country or what's happening in this country
[01:57:07.920 --> 01:57:14.640]  you have to go look at uh the end of the 19th century and the bolshevik revolution and how
[01:57:14.640 --> 01:57:20.160]  they exploit minority groups and get money from wall street you study that stuff all this stuff
[01:57:20.160 --> 01:57:24.400]  will start to make sense that's right the biggest most corrupt money is funding all the wokeism

[02:01:16.640 --> 02:01:21.440]  covered things up disease expert blast your pants ministry of health says whole vaccine
[02:01:21.440 --> 02:01:27.120]  campaign investigate all vaccine injuries and we've got it the same thing coming out in israel
[02:01:27.920 --> 02:01:32.160]  the government covered up the damage put out fake reports that it was safe incredible
[02:01:32.160 --> 02:01:42.800]  information this is huge huge huge huge and it just begs the question how did they
[02:01:42.800 --> 02:01:47.360]  think they'd get away with something like this because they're not rand paul last week called
[02:01:47.360 --> 02:01:51.200]  for the arrest of fauci said we're gonna get you we know you created the virus now they have a
[02:01:51.200 --> 02:01:55.920]  major wuhan lab whistleblower coming out saying we made it to the new york post but almost no
[02:01:55.920 --> 02:01:59.760]  coverage i mean they really did it and i know that's hard for you to believe it's hard for you to
[02:01:59.760 --> 02:02:06.640]  believe because it's so dangerous it's so crazy but bill gates and claus swabs say they want to
[02:02:06.640 --> 02:02:11.440]  depopulate you so they're following through like jeffrey dommer couldn't help but kidnap and kill
[02:02:11.440 --> 02:02:16.240]  people child molesters can't help it they're mass killers they can't help it here's the incredible
[02:02:16.240 --> 02:02:21.760]  japanese government meeting so i am telling you you've got to conduct an investigation no doctor
[02:02:21.760 --> 02:02:26.640]  can make a medical diagnosis simply by looking at such a piece of paper i'm saying that you must
[02:02:26.640 --> 02:02:31.680]  look at the medical reports and do a proper investigation there's no question about it
[02:02:31.680 --> 02:02:36.640]  stop the bad science and do the right science that's enough looks like you're trying to destroy
[02:02:36.640 --> 02:02:41.360]  evidence do the right thing or you're just going to have a criminal lawsuit enough is enough
[02:02:43.440 --> 02:02:49.440]  i don't care what you say no one is going to be convinced by the process or things that you are
[02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:56.000]  talking about well of course we will not only evaluate the results as they are we are trying
[02:02:56.000 --> 02:03:01.840]  you can't possibly have any way to evaluate it what you need clinically speaking is that you
[02:03:01.840 --> 02:03:06.640]  need to look at the medical records properly look at the data and do it properly and carefully
[02:03:06.640 --> 02:03:14.160]  one case at a time people's lives are at stake yes sir we will make every effort to do so you idiot
[02:03:15.200 --> 02:03:21.040]  enough is enough you have so many people here but you are not getting anywhere lawmakers also came
[02:03:21.040 --> 02:03:26.000]  all the way here you can't repeat this kind of thing you should have started from the beginning with
[02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:32.560]  the proper scientific light so immediately disband the ridiculous vaccine casualty evaluation committee
[02:03:32.560 --> 02:03:38.000]  instead set up an investigation committee to investigate all cases and to do so you need to
[02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:44.800]  get proper statisticians and some decent experts you understand then do some tests and investigations
[02:03:44.800 --> 02:03:51.440]  as doctor so no said earlier if you have samples of tissue consider the process of spiked protein people
[02:03:51.440 --> 02:03:57.920]  are already doing research all over the world japan's prestige is at stake you have vaccinated so many
[02:03:57.920 --> 02:04:03.200]  people and yet only 10 of the members of the ministry of health labor and welfare who are
[02:04:03.200 --> 02:04:08.880]  leading the vaccine campaign have been vaccinated with the joke is that first of all you need to
[02:04:08.880 --> 02:04:14.080]  clarify this immediately disband the vaccine casualty evaluation committee and investigate
[02:04:14.080 --> 02:04:19.840]  all the cases you must identify all deaths and unreported deaths in the investigation thousands
[02:04:19.840 --> 02:04:25.520]  and tens of thousands of lives are at stake and one more thing we don't have any idea of the long
[02:04:25.520 --> 02:04:31.360]  term side effects of this vaccine the nanoparticles taken into the body in large quantity unceasingly
[02:04:31.360 --> 02:04:37.280]  produced by proteins people are still sick still in bad physical condition for some reason suddenly
[02:04:37.280 --> 02:04:42.960]  people's blood pressure rises for some reason people suddenly get eczema when we diagnose we
[02:04:42.960 --> 02:04:48.400]  find spike protein in the diagnosis is moving to the next phase we need to stop vaccinating
[02:04:48.400 --> 02:04:53.360]  immediately and take care of the health of all cases that's what the scientific paper also says
[02:04:53.360 --> 02:05:01.440]  you bring in people who don't have a proper understanding christmas 2022 is almost here

[02:06:08.480 --> 02:06:24.400]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[02:06:27.760 --> 02:06:30.880]  you know i've said it probably 500 times in the last 20 years
[02:06:30.880 --> 02:06:37.120]  but i think my job is done when what i'm talking about is past say
[02:06:38.080 --> 02:06:42.640]  meaning it's known for everybody to be true and the large part of the public around the world
[02:06:42.640 --> 02:06:47.280]  not just here in the u.s. people know there's a new world order a world government depopulation
[02:06:47.280 --> 02:06:52.080]  agenda biomedical tyranny they know criminal elements have taken over the government are
[02:06:52.080 --> 02:06:55.600]  censoring and surveilling the people they know there's controlled government human smuggling
[02:06:55.600 --> 02:07:02.400]  i mean it's all coming out but i thought going back decades ago that once we exposed this and
[02:07:02.400 --> 02:07:06.400]  then once they tried to actually launch their plans because we had their own battle plans
[02:07:06.400 --> 02:07:13.280]  people would rally even more and say no to it but instead this reality is so horrible
[02:07:15.200 --> 02:07:17.360]  this reality is so shocking to people
[02:07:17.360 --> 02:07:24.800]  that they just say well i just i'm gonna i'm gonna tune out i'm just gonna
[02:07:24.800 --> 02:07:31.280]  forget this is going on i covered this earlier in the show but all over the world they're
[02:07:31.280 --> 02:07:34.960]  saying you can't farm you can't have cows or sheep anymore we're gonna have climate
[02:07:34.960 --> 02:07:41.600]  lockdowns in major cities in europe and the uk they're doing it look at these headlines it's
[02:07:41.600 --> 02:07:46.720]  official france banned short-haul domestic flights in favor of train travel tells the
[02:07:46.720 --> 02:07:52.960]  general public you can't fly inside france anymore you must take the train but the elites
[02:07:52.960 --> 02:07:58.480]  can use private jets it goes on and on in the netherlands we'll play the video coming up
[02:07:58.480 --> 02:08:03.440]  shock video netherlands police use heavy machinery to overturn tractors and farmers
[02:08:03.440 --> 02:08:07.600]  inside as they are announcing that much of their farms will be shut down to quote save the earth
[02:08:07.600 --> 02:08:16.720]  now farms are bad for the earth oxford share council in trial for climate lockdown starting a year
[02:08:16.720 --> 02:08:24.480]  from now it goes on and on this is a war against the general public a war against prosperity
[02:08:24.480 --> 02:08:29.680]  because the big central banks have unlimited money they want you poor with no job to control you
[02:08:30.640 --> 02:08:36.240]  will we actually walk blindly into this robert barnes joins us for the hour great constitutional
[02:08:36.240 --> 02:08:42.160]  lawyer great historian a good friend of mine barnes law he hosts the barns viva popular podcast as
[02:08:42.160 --> 02:08:48.240]  well robert there's so many dozens of topics i want to get into with you and we hadn't talked
[02:08:48.240 --> 02:08:53.680]  before he came on but obviously we'll talk about the twitter files and how huge those are and the
[02:08:53.680 --> 02:08:59.680]  yay controversy and now ukraine's firing missiles into russia and attacking air bases
[02:08:59.680 --> 02:09:04.000]  100 miles inside russia i mean things are escalating at an insane level you got
[02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:11.600]  obama two days ago making fun of biden saying well we don't let old old uncle joe actually
[02:09:11.600 --> 02:09:18.000]  run anything i mean it's just reaching twilight zone proportions you got project veritas confirming
[02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:23.040]  or smuggling kidnapped kids as young as six for sex slaves they followed them all the way here to
[02:09:23.040 --> 02:09:31.360]  austin interviewed the kids i mean it's just how did evil get this powerful or this expressed or
[02:09:31.360 --> 02:09:35.360]  was it always there we didn't know about it well it was always there but i think it clearly has
[02:09:35.360 --> 02:09:39.920]  gotten worse we'll get your take on that there's a lot of things i just threw out but what's front
[02:09:39.920 --> 02:09:45.920]  and center for you and what do you want to tackle first well i think the the goal of the government
[02:09:45.920 --> 02:09:50.720]  to control what we eat because right now like you mentioned what's happening in the netherlands
[02:09:50.720 --> 02:09:57.280]  they're taking over farms in the name of green energy uk is talking about not allowing certain
[02:09:57.280 --> 02:10:03.120]  fertilizers to or other things to be used it's going to undermine their indigenous organic
[02:10:03.120 --> 02:10:08.640]  farming uh you contrast that to putin and russia that's been a lot of money actually expanding
[02:10:08.640 --> 02:10:13.520]  the or their organic food because they understand that if you control food you control fuel then
[02:10:13.520 --> 02:10:17.760]  you actually really control the world well look at what's happening in pennsylvania you know i
[02:10:17.760 --> 02:10:23.760]  represent amos miller the amish farmer and the u.s department of agriculture has taken i mean here's
[02:10:23.760 --> 02:10:30.960]  a situation where a guy faced you know he currently you know in a week or so uh is looking at jail uh
[02:10:31.760 --> 02:10:37.040]  going to jail a farmer going to jail for what exactly uh going to jail without any conviction of any
[02:10:37.040 --> 02:10:42.800]  crime without any accusation of any crime without any jury verdict of any kind at any time and he's
[02:10:42.800 --> 02:10:49.360]  in a position where he's facing that and potentially bankrupting uh sanctions and fines also again
[02:10:49.360 --> 02:10:55.440]  amounts that happened without a trial by jury uh without any jury trial process really at all
[02:10:56.080 --> 02:11:02.160]  and what what was it that the usda is so bothered by this a guy whose food no one has ever complained
[02:11:02.160 --> 02:11:07.520]  about he makes food the way his customers want him to tell folks the story because that's why
[02:11:07.520 --> 02:11:12.400]  i set it up in the food figuring you would go there they're raiding amish all over this particularly
[02:11:12.400 --> 02:11:17.840]  agreed just selling milk and stuff to their neighbors and others and just just just totally
[02:11:17.840 --> 02:11:22.240]  outrages it's not fentanyl nobody's dying nobody's complaining but they're so scared
[02:11:22.800 --> 02:11:27.120]  the corporations are so scared of independent farms and things because in the future this
[02:11:27.120 --> 02:11:32.320]  will be how we stop the globalists yeah exactly i mean you look at how the usda got started they
[02:11:32.320 --> 02:11:36.160]  got started you know with upton sinclair's the jungle and the rest there they were like the
[02:11:36.160 --> 02:11:42.400]  fda they were supposed to be a marketing agency an advertising agency you know as they made sure
[02:11:42.400 --> 02:11:47.440]  the label on the product you got they're all about informed consent making sure the label on
[02:11:47.440 --> 02:11:52.880]  the product you got matched the product you got that's it they weren't fda is not a super regulatory
[02:11:52.880 --> 02:11:58.720]  medical agency many of them don't even qualify to do that the us department of agriculture is not a
[02:11:58.720 --> 02:12:03.040]  a bunch of farmers in fact they have almost no farmers who work for them they have people who
[02:12:03.040 --> 02:12:07.920]  have no idea what the farming world is like they're zero clue and then here they are trying to and
[02:12:07.920 --> 02:12:13.920]  what they're doing is they're using that power over the label to now say like the fda the usda
[02:12:13.920 --> 02:12:19.200]  now wants to say we control what goes into your body you don't because in the case of amos miller
[02:12:19.200 --> 02:12:25.200]  he makes food he makes meat the way his customers want him to make it they don't want him they don't
[02:12:25.200 --> 02:12:31.920]  want usda inspected meat they don't want chemical laced meat they don't want big corporate laced
[02:12:31.920 --> 02:12:38.080]  meat in fact many of them for health reasons cannot eat that they have to have what amos miller provides
[02:12:38.080 --> 02:12:44.320]  them his customers love them there's no cut there's been never been a customer complaint ever
[02:12:44.320 --> 02:12:49.520]  against amos miller and yet here the us government is coming in trying to shut him down the threatening
[02:12:49.520 --> 02:12:56.080]  to put him in jail uh threatening to bankrupt his farm for what for giving people what they actually
[02:12:56.080 --> 02:13:02.880]  want which is healthy food made the way the ordinary person wants it made his consult customers
[02:13:02.880 --> 02:13:08.400]  want it made they don't want the the chemical laced food they don't want preservative laced food
[02:13:08.400 --> 02:13:14.160]  they want food made in the traditional way that amish have been making it for centuries and for
[02:13:14.160 --> 02:13:19.360]  that that's why they're trying to shut them down be and their goal is to use this case uh in order
[02:13:19.360 --> 02:13:26.320]  to establish a precedent that says we the us government uh we the us department of agriculture
[02:13:26.320 --> 02:13:31.360]  we get to dictate what you can put into your own body i mean for example they have taken the position
[02:13:31.360 --> 02:13:36.160]  at different times in this case the us department of agriculture that they can control what you
[02:13:36.160 --> 02:13:41.280]  make for yourself how you grow it for yourself and then remember that story just a couple of weeks
[02:13:41.280 --> 02:13:46.320]  ago where they by the administration said tell us if you have a home garden what do you make it in
[02:13:46.320 --> 02:13:51.680]  your home garden the goal is ultimately to determine and dictate what you can put into your
[02:13:51.680 --> 02:13:56.080]  and all they've hired tens of thousands of new ones at seventy something thousand new iris agents
[02:13:56.080 --> 02:14:01.520]  to go after six hundred dollars and above so they're getting ready to go after the little guy big time
[02:14:01.520 --> 02:14:06.160]  absolutely remember what the iris said uh we've talked about before back in the uh rosa administration
[02:14:06.160 --> 02:14:11.200]  the iris said uh people shouldn't be thankful for what we what we uh shouldn't be mad at us for what
[02:14:11.200 --> 02:14:16.160]  we do take they should be thankful for what we don't take because the f dr administration actually
[02:14:16.160 --> 02:14:21.920]  recommended taxing people for their own labor in their own home if you make your own food you
[02:14:21.920 --> 02:14:27.920]  should have to pay a tax on that as if you got it at a restaurant if you fix up your own house
[02:14:27.920 --> 02:14:32.640]  you should pay a tax on that that's where it's ultimately going the goal is to have it's ultimately
[02:14:32.640 --> 02:14:37.440]  converting us into chattel it's good they control what goes into our body in terms of medicine
[02:14:37.440 --> 02:14:42.000]  they control what goes into our body in terms of food they could they get to tax us for a
[02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:46.320]  for just waking up in the morning that's the ultimate objective because that ultimately
[02:14:46.320 --> 02:14:52.480]  makes us all uh legally the effect effectively chattel of the state the state gets to tell us
[02:14:52.480 --> 02:14:56.960]  what's good for us and what's not but just like they want to do in the information space that's
[02:14:56.960 --> 02:15:01.600]  why you know the uh that's why all this stuff that's coming out it came out last week the fbi
[02:15:01.600 --> 02:15:07.120]  was you know taking people off of social media and directing it so the who is the community out
[02:15:07.120 --> 02:15:12.800]  there in america that doesn't listen that doesn't defer to the government for their education their
[02:15:12.800 --> 02:15:18.000]  food or their medicine and and is healthier uh than the average community and wealthier than
[02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:22.720]  the average community in america it's the amish that's why they're going out they have basically
[02:15:22.720 --> 02:15:28.640]  almost no autism the 1950s autism was like maybe one out of ten million now it's one out of a hundred
[02:15:29.280 --> 02:15:34.240]  they don't even have autism yeah i mean i mean by every measurement they live longer they live
[02:15:34.240 --> 02:15:38.640]  better they live healthier they're they're independent wealth like our founders wanted to
[02:15:38.640 --> 02:15:42.800]  have been the basis for our democracy that's why they're going to always target the amish first
[02:15:42.800 --> 02:15:46.640]  because they don't want people to look at that and say hey i can live a healthier wealth that's
[02:15:46.640 --> 02:15:53.360]  right ms 13 is good the chai comms are good zalinski's good amish bad robert martz stay with us we
[02:15:53.360 --> 02:16:02.320]  will be right back and talk more about this until about 150 years ago cultures all over the world
[02:16:02.320 --> 02:16:09.280]  believe that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors
[02:16:09.280 --> 02:16:16.080]  they associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather of course it wasn't the cold weather or
[02:16:16.080 --> 02:16:22.800]  catching a chill that killed people what was killing people was a lack of vitamin d3 you see
[02:16:22.800 --> 02:16:29.920]  the sun via your skin helps your body produce vitamin d3 but if you're not getting enough sun

[02:20:30.800 --> 02:20:36.320]  please keep it up the enemy is very upset so barnes robert barnes conscious lawyer joining
[02:20:36.320 --> 02:20:40.880]  us here been involved in losses because twitter and more i like felon leading the charge to expose
[02:20:40.880 --> 02:20:47.120]  censorship he at least is doing a better job than other establishment outlets like google and facebook
[02:20:47.120 --> 02:20:54.640]  and uh apple they're helping you know in some cases like apple run death camps in china but
[02:20:54.640 --> 02:20:58.160]  watching what elon's doing what do you think he's really doing what do you make of the first twitter
[02:20:58.160 --> 02:21:03.360]  file drops which is confirmed what we already knew and and and where do you see all this going
[02:21:04.560 --> 02:21:10.800]  well i mean i think it's uh i think it's it's it's a definitely an improvement over where it was
[02:21:10.800 --> 02:21:16.240]  whether it will reach the place a lot of people have hopes it for uh is yet to be determined
[02:21:16.240 --> 02:21:20.160]  so i i think at this level it's great that he is giving journalists and independent
[02:21:20.800 --> 02:21:28.720]  folks access to the internal files that show the scale the scope the direction the deception
[02:21:28.720 --> 02:21:35.520]  that went into all the big election fornication of 2020 of which twitter was a critical component
[02:21:35.520 --> 02:21:42.160]  as musk himself is acknowledged there was twitter clearly interfered in a range of elections 2020
[02:21:42.160 --> 02:21:48.080]  us election was just one of those he's mentioned maybe that it's also done it in brazil and that
[02:21:48.080 --> 02:21:54.400]  he'll be that he'll be researching that further so that's hopeful um but you see the scale of it
[02:21:54.400 --> 02:22:01.200]  and and hopefully it continues in particular i would say where he has not yet met his own test
[02:22:01.200 --> 02:22:06.320]  for promoting freedom of thought freedom of speech freedom of debate freedom of a discussion
[02:22:06.320 --> 02:22:13.840]  is in the covet context uh dot peter mccollis still banned robert malone is still banned uh there's
[02:22:13.840 --> 02:22:18.800]  there's still algorithmic bands there's people that search my name still can't find it so there's
[02:22:18.800 --> 02:22:24.080]  still shadow bands still in place and in particular in the covet context is where a lot of people have
[02:22:24.080 --> 02:22:31.120]  not yet been restored so i think that he there's a lot more he can do for the free speech a movement
[02:22:31.120 --> 02:22:37.040]  for transparency in america but he's definitely a massive improvement over where it was and what
[02:22:37.040 --> 02:22:41.440]  he's disclosing and divulging is things that we suspected were true things that have been
[02:22:42.080 --> 02:22:47.840]  twitter's been accused of doing but now we're seeing the proof including the biden administration
[02:22:47.840 --> 02:22:52.720]  clearly lying about what they knew and didn't know about suppression of the story of the
[02:22:52.720 --> 02:22:57.760]  hunter biden laptop store but i think the big story that musk has also talked about that i
[02:22:57.760 --> 02:23:03.360]  think should be the number one target of republicans in the house for impeachment potential impeachment
[02:23:03.360 --> 02:23:11.200]  hearings is the ftx story as he put out he suspects that ftx didn't just put in 30 million or 70 million
[02:23:11.200 --> 02:23:17.440]  or 140 million into the democratic party over the last two years this ponzi fraud scheme on the
[02:23:17.440 --> 02:23:22.960]  crypto exchanges that also is attempting to disrupt and derail bitcoin it likely won't
[02:23:22.960 --> 02:23:27.440]  succeed in doing so but that appears to be part of the goal replace it with central bank digital
[02:23:27.440 --> 02:23:32.640]  currencies like a fed coin but it's clear but according to elan musk he suspects that they
[02:23:32.640 --> 02:23:39.680]  laundered a billion dollars to the democratic party and its allied organizations through ftx a
[02:23:39.680 --> 02:23:44.720]  billion dollars i mean remember with richard nixon watergate they were talking about small
[02:23:44.720 --> 02:23:51.760]  like what 25 000 dollar donations 75 000 dollar donations what's a billion dollars funded by fraud
[02:23:51.760 --> 02:23:59.120]  by an ftx that was protected and had family ties to high and friends at the highest ranks of both
[02:23:59.120 --> 02:24:04.720]  these securities and exchange commission busy harassing the libraries of the world well that's
[02:24:04.720 --> 02:24:10.400]  right so they're having their time to funnel hundreds of millions of dollars to uh campaigns
[02:24:10.400 --> 02:24:17.360]  exposing uh different treatments for coveted discrediting ivermectin discrediting hydroxychloroquine
[02:24:17.360 --> 02:24:22.640]  she put in tens of millions to do that uh funding all sorts of leftist groups he was installed set
[02:24:22.640 --> 02:24:26.800]  up to run his pump and dump which they would then turn around and use to bring down bitcoin
[02:24:26.800 --> 02:24:32.000]  but now it's blown up in their face completely and i think that i mean that that's the biggest
[02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:36.640]  scandal maybe the biggest political scandal uh in our history to a certain in terms of at least
[02:24:36.640 --> 02:24:40.960]  the amounts of money involved i mean basically the democratic party set up a young bernie made
[02:24:40.960 --> 02:24:46.080]  off to rip off a bunch of people with the so that they could enrich themselves and enrich
[02:24:46.080 --> 02:24:50.560]  their political allies and their political causes including him his aunt sits at the world economic
[02:24:50.560 --> 02:24:56.320]  forum and is connected to all the pandemic stuff his mom is the is the one of the lead get out the
[02:24:56.320 --> 02:25:02.880]  vote organizers there's now clear ties between ftx laundered stolen funds and the and republican and
[02:25:02.880 --> 02:25:07.600]  the democratic party efforts in arizona against republicans like harry leis and now we've seen
[02:25:07.600 --> 02:25:14.160]  the new york times doing facelifts for ftx what a these are the little disgusting criminals
[02:25:14.160 --> 02:25:20.640]  were up against me look at them absolutely i mean the if this was done on behalf of trump
[02:25:20.640 --> 02:25:26.560]  everybody would already be locked up now and instead uh you know the spf uh they're sam bankman
[02:25:26.560 --> 02:25:32.080]  free another one of these two last name guys uh is is you know just chatting away in the bahamas
[02:25:32.080 --> 02:25:38.560]  the ceo uh it was spotted at a coffee shop in new york there's been no consequence i mean i mean
[02:25:38.560 --> 02:25:42.960]  you've had to deal with the insanity of the of the folks up in new york uh trump has had to deal
[02:25:42.960 --> 02:25:48.320]  with that insanity why were they completely asleep at the wheel why was the sec commissioner
[02:25:48.320 --> 02:25:54.480]  personally meeting with spf and promoting him right now maxine waters is on social media promoting
[02:25:54.480 --> 02:25:58.960]  him right to this day so the democrats are seeking and as you note the new york times
[02:25:58.960 --> 02:26:04.480]  writing puff peeps is about him so the institutional democratic left engaged in a massive
[02:26:04.480 --> 02:26:10.880]  poll they're having televised interviews with him like ted talks worshiping him absolutely
[02:26:10.880 --> 02:26:15.360]  that he's a sweetheart and well i mean this is a guy compared to warren buffett by jim kramer at
[02:26:15.360 --> 02:26:22.080]  cnbc this was a guy that was called the savior and not only did he contaminate the entire
[02:26:22.080 --> 02:26:28.640]  environment and the crypto to try to derail bitcoin and was the leading effort to regulate bitcoin
[02:26:29.280 --> 02:26:34.240]  and try to limit its ability to compete with the u.s currency and other currencies of the
[02:26:34.240 --> 02:26:39.520]  state governments and central banks but he was also it clearly they're doubly their money bags
[02:26:39.520 --> 02:26:44.800]  for the pandemic policies but also money bags for the democratic part so does he get away with it
[02:26:44.800 --> 02:26:50.640]  that little slimy bernie maddof go blilly i mean and not only that and then of course as we now
[02:26:50.640 --> 02:26:55.360]  know he's tied to ukraine ukraine we were using him we everybody knows ukraine is one big fat
[02:26:55.360 --> 02:27:00.160]  money laundering machine that's what zelinski spends each day doing is washing those dollars
[02:27:00.160 --> 02:27:05.440]  but the uh now he of course we now that know that money came through there so you may have
[02:27:05.440 --> 02:27:11.920]  had government money used to fund democratic campaigns through the laundry machine of a
[02:27:11.920 --> 02:27:18.160]  combination of ukraine and fdx so if republicans are serious at all about doing anything with
[02:27:18.160 --> 02:27:23.280]  their house power now they've taken over the house of representatives their their first and foremost
[02:27:23.280 --> 02:27:29.840]  priority should be exposing the scam that is fdx of the democratic party its connections to biden
[02:27:29.840 --> 02:27:34.560]  it's connect because it implicates their efforts to do central bank digital so let's talk about
[02:27:34.560 --> 02:27:40.000]  this your smart grab a lot of connections obviously some good people online started exposing fdx last
[02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:47.360]  year um and this could really bring down a large portion of the deep state i mean i mean is that
[02:27:47.360 --> 02:27:52.720]  what you're getting at absolutely this fdx was the deep states piggy bank and it was the deep
[02:27:52.720 --> 02:27:58.480]  states piggy bank to fund the war in ukraine deep states piggy bank to fund pandemic politics
[02:27:58.480 --> 02:28:03.760]  to suppress ivermectin to push vaccines it was the deep states piggy bank to get out to vote for
[02:28:03.760 --> 02:28:10.000]  democrats and key races and key places like arizona so they could keep popular just like the cia use
[02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:16.000]  cocaine crack cocaine to fund the contras that was their piggy bank fdx is the democratic parties
[02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:22.480]  piggy bank is that fdx is bcci on steroids i mean that that's what it would that that's what it
[02:28:22.480 --> 02:28:27.440]  basically exposes and that's why if they really dig in this not only exposes the biden administration
[02:28:27.440 --> 02:28:32.640]  in the democratic party writ large it exposes the media establishment it exposes every aspect of the
[02:28:32.640 --> 02:28:38.080]  deep try to stay there so this is the mega international credit and settlements this is
[02:28:38.080 --> 02:28:46.400]  this is literally the bcci 2.0 this is unbelievable wow all right i want to come back and just cover

[02:33:17.040 --> 02:33:23.040]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[02:33:23.040 --> 02:33:29.120]  all right robert barnes is our guest i want to get into russia and these missile strikes 100 miles
[02:33:29.120 --> 02:33:34.800]  inside russia at their nuclear bomber base the ukraine is getting credit for doing now it's
[02:33:34.800 --> 02:33:40.480]  saying that escalation is but first i want to get into the yay interview thursday the khanye west
[02:33:40.480 --> 02:33:46.640]  biggest thing i mean ever we're talking probably a billion views out there uh i had no idea who's
[02:33:46.640 --> 02:33:52.160]  gonna do that i didn't say what he could say when he came here but i said to him you know you
[02:33:52.160 --> 02:33:57.040]  should talk about other big topics and things and not be baited into this stuff he's like i want to
[02:33:57.040 --> 02:34:03.360]  talk about love and talk about my campaign and all this but once he got here um that that that's
[02:34:03.360 --> 02:34:09.120]  where they went and you know i'm still not sure i talked to him quite a bit on the phone where
[02:34:09.120 --> 02:34:14.960]  where this is all going or what his point is but if i look at the marlago thing at least he's honest
[02:34:14.960 --> 02:34:19.920]  that trump did not know and then trump said y'all meet with ye and he gets there and he
[02:34:19.920 --> 02:34:24.160]  didn't know who nick fointess is these people and they go to the dinner with him and then trump gets
[02:34:24.160 --> 02:34:29.760]  mad at him at the dinner when he learns who they who nick fointess is uh and the media
[02:34:29.760 --> 02:34:36.240]  misrepresent to nick is but i saw this happen it's like now that the nicks now they've called
[02:34:36.240 --> 02:34:40.240]  fointess that he's like embracing and saying okay i do like hitler so before i never heard
[02:34:40.240 --> 02:34:44.960]  nick fointess say stuff like that now he is so i disagree with what nick fointess is saying and i
[02:34:44.960 --> 02:34:50.080]  disagree with his worldview and uh you know richard spencer was out there in a video in fact find
[02:34:50.080 --> 02:34:55.680]  that from yesterday i went to get to it by saying oh finally ye knows the dark power of hitler and
[02:34:55.680 --> 02:35:02.000]  how beautiful it is yeah dark powers right i mean they say oh and i noticed the left everywhere
[02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:09.280]  nbc news texas monthly all of jones was just mad that ye said it out loud jones is really pro hitler
[02:35:09.280 --> 02:35:13.760]  too no i'm not like george sorrell surrounded up jews um both my grandfather's almost died in world
[02:35:13.760 --> 02:35:18.880]  war two i've read a lot of history i've stated hitler was really really bad news i was a total
[02:35:18.880 --> 02:35:24.480]  authoritarian um my grandfather you know told me about things that he did to people that my
[02:35:24.480 --> 02:35:31.760]  grandfather knew who were german not not not jewish uh and and so i legitimately am a history buff
[02:35:31.760 --> 02:35:39.440]  and so i'm very offended by the uh left who have all their nazi tendencies and their love of george
[02:35:39.440 --> 02:35:44.960]  sorrell's and all their love of nazi like ideologies of censorship and control pointing their dirty
[02:35:44.960 --> 02:35:52.240]  fingers at me and saying i'm like them uh so you know that's where i'm at i i legitimately don't
[02:35:52.240 --> 02:35:58.560]  like some failed political party from 76 78 years ago and i don't have a fetish with you go boss
[02:35:58.560 --> 02:36:05.520]  uniforms uh and the rest of it i find it absolutely disgusting uh so that's where i met on this but i
[02:36:05.520 --> 02:36:11.120]  think yay uh i wouldn't call him mentally ill you know i think he means well for the first amendment
[02:36:11.120 --> 02:36:15.520]  i think he was trying to be shocking but i think he was wound up to basically do what he did then
[02:36:16.240 --> 02:36:19.520]  and i told him i said i'd like to have a real interview with you on real topics but
[02:36:20.240 --> 02:36:24.480]  what's your view on that whole fiasco and trainwreck and will any good come out of it or
[02:36:24.480 --> 02:36:30.720]  what's your view you know i'm trying to get a read on where uh kanye's at and so the i have a
[02:36:30.720 --> 02:36:36.320]  couple of different interpretations one alternative explanation is based on his early part of his
[02:36:36.320 --> 02:36:41.600]  interview with tim pool where he disclosed that someone has told him he owes 50 million
[02:36:41.600 --> 02:36:48.320]  dollars in taxes and that he may be subject to an irs criminal case um and that you know made him
[02:36:48.320 --> 02:36:55.040]  nervous and edgy and and the fact that he and his brain connected that to his public persona on
[02:36:55.040 --> 02:37:01.440]  politics suggested to me at least one alternative take may be that you know if you were kanye you
[02:37:01.440 --> 02:37:06.000]  the case you would research for you know who was a prominent person who was accused of having
[02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:11.680]  unusual beliefs and accused of tax evasion who ultimately was acquitted of almost all the charges
[02:37:11.680 --> 02:37:16.720]  well that would be my client wesley snipes and that's also he's also african-american he's also
[02:37:16.720 --> 02:37:22.320]  male he's also a celebrity in the hollywood world and a lot of the headlines back then said quoted
[02:37:22.320 --> 02:37:26.720]  something we made a statement of which we said if crazy was criminal half of hollywood would be in
[02:37:26.720 --> 02:37:32.240]  prison so our point was crazy wasn't criminal some people perceive the snipe's case as snipe's
[02:37:32.240 --> 02:37:37.120]  getting acquitted because he was quote unquote crazy that's not actually what happened at the
[02:37:37.120 --> 02:37:42.960]  trial but it's how a lot of media represented it it may be the case that kanye thinks that if he is
[02:37:42.960 --> 02:37:50.080]  perceived as crazy that that will reduce the risk of of of criminal prosecution on taxes
[02:37:50.080 --> 02:37:55.920]  because if you're looking at 50 million you're talking about 25 years hanging out with el chapo
[02:37:55.920 --> 02:38:01.440]  and supermax i mean it's it's something like that uh he would be facing the end of his career
[02:38:01.440 --> 02:38:06.240]  not only end of his career but the end of his natural born life in a prison so it might be in
[02:38:06.240 --> 02:38:10.880]  his interest to be like okay i'll take some hits and sacrifice some things on the financial side
[02:38:10.880 --> 02:38:15.760]  in order to first to try to get close to trump well now trump's out of power so now what do i do
[02:38:15.760 --> 02:38:20.800]  well maybe i i create an image like uh that people and people remember you the famous mobster case in
[02:38:20.800 --> 02:38:25.760]  new york uh people maybe i create an image that i'm crazy and i say things that are so
[02:38:26.480 --> 02:38:32.240]  wild that people say i can't be anything but crazy so you think he's going for an insanity defense
[02:38:33.520 --> 02:38:37.200]  in essence he may have misinterpreted the headlines from the snipe's defense to mean
[02:38:37.200 --> 02:38:43.600]  that if you're crazy you can't go to prison um in the tax context actually it's a more nuanced
[02:38:43.600 --> 02:38:49.760]  defense it's the good faith defense reliance defense he may have those defenses too and it may be
[02:38:49.760 --> 02:38:53.680]  that his accountants maybe have a particular religious background that might explain some
[02:38:53.680 --> 02:38:59.680]  of his anger and animosity uh that got him into trouble i don't know uh i i agree with you that
[02:38:59.680 --> 02:39:06.800]  the uh there's no rational explanation for why he's being so self-destructive uh i don't really
[02:39:06.800 --> 02:39:11.200]  believe he really hosts i don't think he likes hitler i don't believe that for a second i really
[02:39:11.200 --> 02:39:18.720]  don't um so he's never given off malevolent vibes malicious vibes before and so and he still doesn't
[02:39:18.720 --> 02:39:24.480]  really while he's saying things that sound malevolent and sound malicious so i i think there's something
[02:39:24.480 --> 02:39:29.360]  else going on uh it's always possible i mean we know those guys that folks out in hollywood
[02:39:29.360 --> 02:39:34.000]  they get to Kanye's age a lot of them fall apart because they were stars when they're really young
[02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:40.160]  they never matured in a normal way they get to their 40s early 50s and they do wild and crazy stuff
[02:39:40.160 --> 02:39:45.280]  uh that's not in their self-interest so we can't rule that out given the background he's been in
[02:39:45.280 --> 02:39:50.640]  but it didn't strike me as a thought out rational self-interested conversation
[02:39:50.640 --> 02:39:54.800]  because he comes across as somebody who's too intelligent to say some of the stuff he's saying
[02:39:54.800 --> 02:40:00.080]  now uh that he's he's not the wild crazy guy he's what do you think i agree what do you think the
[02:40:00.080 --> 02:40:06.960]  overall effect of this was the fallout from it um i think i mean it's it's uh people really believe
[02:40:06.960 --> 02:40:11.600]  he's crazy i think that's one impact and that will have a negative impact on certain aspects but
[02:40:11.600 --> 02:40:16.720]  again maybe in his mind will have some positive benefits um i think it marginalized some people
[02:40:16.720 --> 02:40:21.440]  that were trying to promote themselves into the mainstream much like richard spencer tried to
[02:40:21.440 --> 02:40:26.400]  you know piggyback off of trump to look normal and then when people realized what he believed
[02:40:26.400 --> 02:40:30.320]  they weren't interested in that that's all mythology of the left that you know there's this
[02:40:30.320 --> 02:40:36.640]  tiny tiny little splinter group of people who believe these you know crazy ideas about i was about
[02:40:36.640 --> 02:40:43.040]  to say i mean in a way yay gave a big live preserver or an escape mode to the democrats because
[02:40:43.040 --> 02:40:48.960]  hitler's like an almost 80 year old joke he killed 20 million germans you know total loser
[02:40:49.600 --> 02:40:55.760]  and then you've got this big hip-hop rap icon literally saying this when the democrats whole
[02:40:55.760 --> 02:41:00.720]  cosmologies built around formerly were all nazis now it's all we're a russian agent it's not there's
[02:41:00.720 --> 02:41:05.840]  no truth to it and and and then now there's just explodes out there i i'm trying to figure it out
[02:41:05.840 --> 02:41:10.080]  but but no i did not know that was gonna go on on air by the way i support his free speech
[02:41:10.080 --> 02:41:14.480]  and i let and i let him say it i didn't agree with it see see see that's the difference folks
[02:41:15.120 --> 02:41:19.120]  free speech means you let people have their speech and i know the general audience gets that but
[02:41:19.120 --> 02:41:24.000]  the left's like jones endorses that he let him say it well you guys all certainly grab what he said
[02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:29.920]  and put it out for a debate that's the whole point of it oh exactly i mean i mean your review
[02:41:29.920 --> 02:41:34.800]  reviews on this have been uh well established for a long time i mean when people let's say
[02:41:34.800 --> 02:41:40.000]  racism or anti-semitism with alex jones that makes zero sense at all uh and have attacked and
[02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:43.520]  criticized and critiqued people that have voiced those and you said it right there in the air so
[02:41:43.520 --> 02:41:47.680]  i don't like either period sorry you know you can think what you want you but no that that's a place
[02:41:47.680 --> 02:41:53.520]  i'm not going there with you so the you are very clear on all of that the uh it's too bad in my
[02:41:53.520 --> 02:41:58.160]  view because i thought konye had some potential intriguing insights as a person with a cult
[02:41:58.160 --> 02:42:02.640]  big cultural platform well sure i mean i see the hitler thing like like a lot of these elites are
[02:42:02.640 --> 02:42:07.200]  being into being like these powerful executives want to be beaten by a dominatrix or they want
[02:42:07.200 --> 02:42:11.600]  to eat poop or be peed on i don't want to be beaten by a dominatrix i don't want to eat poop
[02:42:11.600 --> 02:42:17.120]  and i see liking hitler is like the naughty time let's go eat poop the left loves hitler
[02:42:17.120 --> 02:42:21.760]  they obsess on him they worship him they need him to to pretend they're not that when everything
[02:42:21.760 --> 02:42:27.760]  they do is like that no i'm not like you hitler loving leftist i don't eat poop i'm not a pedophile
[02:42:27.760 --> 02:42:33.120]  either oh exactly and i mean i mean hitler had deep state ties from the very beginning i mean so
[02:42:33.120 --> 02:42:39.920]  the uh loving hitler is like eating poop seriously absolutely communists like fascists
[02:42:39.920 --> 02:42:44.000]  because they in a fascist like the communists because they justify each other's presence
[02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:49.440]  stallion admired hitler it's on record and i hate him loving communisms like eating poop
[02:42:49.440 --> 02:42:55.440]  i don't like communism or fascism different we'll be right back sorry about the gross analogy i just
[02:42:55.440 --> 02:43:04.240]  can't handle it december 2022 is here and we are proud and very excited to announce that free shipping

[02:43:58.080 --> 02:44:03.200]  so when i first started taking survival shield basically i was 275 pounds i was overweight i
[02:44:03.200 --> 02:44:08.560]  had brain fog like you wouldn't believe i was barely holding on to a job and i heard doctor group
[02:44:08.560 --> 02:44:13.120]  on your show and i listened to it so the first one i got was the original survival shield the x1
[02:44:13.120 --> 02:44:16.960]  and it worked pretty good and then shortly thereafter you came out with that shield you had
[02:44:16.960 --> 02:44:20.560]  you know with a deep burden source you know and i got really excited about that so i took it and
[02:44:20.560 --> 02:44:26.880]  man in two weeks i went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened you
[02:44:26.880 --> 02:44:32.000]  know i could think again i could connect with people again and over the course of the next
[02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:36.400]  couple of years i got my health back and i religiously take basically all of your supplements
[02:44:36.400 --> 02:44:41.360]  they're they're all absolutely amazing supplements the one i like recently is knockout it literally
[02:44:41.360 --> 02:44:45.840]  like if you want to sleep just take it it's amazing it works but anyway so the point is we have to
[02:44:45.840 --> 02:44:50.400]  get ourselves clean that's a break free of the globalist system and the only way to do that is
[02:44:50.400 --> 02:44:55.520]  to take our own health into our own hand beautifully said brother i thank you so much for your call

[02:46:02.560 --> 02:46:08.640]  believe that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter because of something called
[02:46:08.640 --> 02:46:15.520]  vapors they associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather of course it wasn't the cold
[02:46:15.520 --> 02:46:22.400]  weather or catching a chill that killed people what was killing people was a lack of vitamin d3
[02:46:22.400 --> 02:46:29.360]  you see the sun via your skin helps your body produce vitamin d3 but if you're not getting
[02:46:29.360 --> 02:46:34.640]  enough sun you will not produce vitamin d3 and then it's very easy for viruses and other things
[02:46:34.640 --> 02:46:39.040]  you start replicating and taking your body over so now it's more important than ever because the

[02:47:10.960 --> 02:47:14.720]  final segment with robert barnes a host about 15 minutes the next hour before charles and
[02:47:14.720 --> 02:47:20.000]  lentic takes over but a lot of those haven't hit yet but i wanted to get a vaccine update robert
[02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:24.960]  barnes involved with robert f kennedy jr and the big lawsuits it's coming out in major governments
[02:47:24.960 --> 02:47:29.520]  that they know the vaccine's deadly but it's not a vaccine this is huge moment we're at
[02:47:29.520 --> 02:47:35.920]  i wanted to cover that with him but first let's get into that other topic we were just discussing
[02:47:35.920 --> 02:47:42.320]  during the break the oathkeepers after i saw the trial read the transcripts Stuart Rhodes did nothing
[02:47:42.320 --> 02:47:47.760]  wrong other than i think being surrounded by some feds and informants i asked barnes his opinion
[02:47:47.760 --> 02:47:51.680]  without me even telling mine that's what he said he's been following it very very closely
[02:47:51.680 --> 02:47:57.120]  Stuart Rhodes did nothing found not guilty of trying to stop the certification of the vote
[02:47:57.120 --> 02:48:01.680]  found not guilty of trying to block congress but guilty of decision conspiracy so he's guilty
[02:48:01.680 --> 02:48:07.920]  of a conspiracy but he didn't carry it out uh i mean again Stuart Rhodes completely set up no
[02:48:07.920 --> 02:48:12.480]  doubt about it your expert take on that absolutely i mean first of all the mere fact that any
[02:48:12.480 --> 02:48:16.640]  sedition charges are pending or that this law still exists is something that is a disgrace to
[02:48:16.640 --> 02:48:21.280]  american freedom this law has historically the sedition laws going back to the alien and sedition
[02:48:21.280 --> 02:48:26.480]  acts in the early beginning of the country which thomas jefferson rightly denounced as wrongful
[02:48:26.480 --> 02:48:30.320]  and directly against the constitutional history and we're thrown out pretty quickly then we bring
[02:48:30.320 --> 02:48:35.280]  him back for world war one to promote world war one we lock up eugene v debbs we lock up victor
[02:48:35.280 --> 02:48:40.720]  burger a congressman from milwaukee just for opposing world war one uh these laws shouldn't
[02:48:40.720 --> 02:48:45.440]  exist these laws shouldn't be on the book these sedition laws have been the deep states tools
[02:48:45.440 --> 02:48:49.840]  to take out dissidents and critics and so the mere fact that the charge was even made
[02:48:49.840 --> 02:48:54.800]  is an abomination to the constitution in my view but the next part is what happened at the trial
[02:48:54.800 --> 02:49:00.000]  the trial never never should have taken place in the district of columbia in the dc of martin
[02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:06.160]  luther king could have got a fair jury in 1950s birmingham from an all-white jury pool
[02:49:06.160 --> 02:49:12.400]  then can any uh trump ally in the district of columbia they've proven that again and again and
[02:49:12.400 --> 02:49:17.040]  again and they proved it again here with issuing verdicts that made no sense and it was the evidence
[02:49:17.040 --> 02:49:22.880]  was so overwhelming that uh stewart roads did absolutely nothing that day to interfere or
[02:49:22.880 --> 02:49:29.680]  impair anything the government was doing that even a bunch of hardcore trump haters had to
[02:49:29.680 --> 02:49:35.200]  admit that and then they convict him of some some speech basically they're the seditious conspiracy
[02:49:35.840 --> 02:49:40.640]  conviction is based on speech they're like oh you know he tweeted something he texted something
[02:49:40.640 --> 02:49:46.720]  he he made a comment once this is insane not only that all of these people were not trying to
[02:49:46.720 --> 02:49:52.800]  impair or interfere with anything they were trying to make sure that our congress did
[02:49:52.800 --> 02:49:59.200]  what the constitution required them to do which is a meaningful review of whether the election
[02:49:59.200 --> 02:50:04.720]  was constitutionally conducted that's their constitutional oath so the oathkeepers were
[02:50:04.720 --> 02:50:10.000]  just making sure congress kept its oath they weren't trying to prevent congress from doing
[02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:15.280]  its oath just the opposite so so where does the whole january 6 fiasco go from here
[02:50:16.880 --> 02:50:22.320]  i mean i as everything we talked about from the get-go that this was a setup that this was a trap
[02:50:22.320 --> 02:50:28.160]  that this is politically motivated prosecutions that this is a perversion of justice uh has all
[02:50:28.160 --> 02:50:32.640]  been proven true and then so i mean there's even more feds and rats than we thought there were
[02:50:32.640 --> 02:50:36.480]  i mean the i mean they were all over the place and they were trying to hide them until the last
[02:50:36.480 --> 02:50:41.520]  minute and only in the middle of trial they did disclose that there were more than almost a dozen
[02:50:41.520 --> 02:50:46.000]  rats and informants and feds working right close in the oathkeepers they were the ones
[02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:52.480]  behind january 6 it was a fedsurrection not an insurrection that took place on january 6
[02:50:52.480 --> 02:50:57.040]  and we've seen abundant evidence of it from these trials so maybe the if the house is smart
[02:50:57.040 --> 02:51:01.520]  they'll hold real hearings that will expose this and hopefully the next president of the united
[02:51:01.520 --> 02:51:07.040]  states pardons everybody with these embarrassing trials the way thomas jefferson did for the
[02:51:07.040 --> 02:51:12.320]  false charges of the alien and sedition acts more than almost two centuries ago and for those that
[02:51:12.320 --> 02:51:17.200]  don't know these sedition acts only used back in the early part of the country and then again
[02:51:17.200 --> 02:51:21.760]  they're in the civil war they hadn't used that in a long time the few times the feds have used it right
[02:51:21.760 --> 02:51:25.760]  the last 50 60 years it got struck down the courts threw it out so the fact they're trying to bring
[02:51:25.760 --> 02:51:31.680]  this back is really chilling oh completely it's the just the weaponization of the legal system
[02:51:31.680 --> 02:51:37.600]  writ large so whether it's a austin judge who can't read the law pretending that punitive damages
[02:51:37.600 --> 02:51:42.640]  can be 40 million when they legally cannot be under the law showing a complete lack of by the way
[02:51:42.640 --> 02:51:46.480]  speak to that because people think oh that's just how it's complaining no found guilty about two
[02:51:46.480 --> 02:51:52.320]  judges rigged trials telling juries i'm guilty they want trillions of dollars in texas 50 million
[02:51:52.320 --> 02:51:57.600]  dollar deal uh it's captain five million the law says that but she says i don't care then she said
[02:51:57.600 --> 02:52:03.040]  he's also guilty of elder abuse because this guy's above 50 something even though the jury didn't
[02:52:03.040 --> 02:52:07.360]  hear that and it's charged he says well the jury also finds him guilty of that after the jury's gone
[02:52:07.360 --> 02:52:13.920]  i mean this is like beyond kangaroo court this is ridiculous oh completely any degree to which
[02:52:13.920 --> 02:52:19.440]  people had any doubt whether the judge was anything more than a partisan hack who made an embarrassment
[02:52:19.440 --> 02:52:26.960]  of the rule of law in texas was ended when she ignored the statutory cap on damages and then
[02:52:26.960 --> 02:52:32.720]  started making up claims that didn't exist in the trial i've done elder abuse charges this has
[02:52:32.720 --> 02:52:38.000]  nothing to do with that i mean it's patently absurd is she the fact that she had to reach for those
[02:52:38.000 --> 02:52:43.440]  excuses in pretext while threatening your lawyers once again that that she's going to take adverse
[02:52:43.440 --> 02:52:48.240]  action against lawyers just for representing you in court effectively and so that's what we're
[02:52:48.240 --> 02:52:54.320]  seeing example after example of the legal system being overtly and openly weaponized to go after
[02:52:54.320 --> 02:52:59.520]  dissidents but this doesn't signal strength does it if you had a look at this is a football game
[02:52:59.520 --> 02:53:05.680]  at halftime how's the deep state doing versus team america well if they wouldn't be this desperate
[02:53:05.680 --> 02:53:09.680]  they wouldn't be talking about trying to indict president trump they wouldn't be desperate to
[02:53:09.680 --> 02:53:15.520]  avoid a special master review and beg the 11th circuit to give them undue deference they wouldn't
[02:53:15.520 --> 02:53:20.800]  be taking these steps it's like in our vaccine mayday cases so the western district of texas
[02:53:20.800 --> 02:53:24.640]  a judge in waco is going to decide whether we get to go forward the children's health defense
[02:53:24.640 --> 02:53:29.120]  bobby kennedy and i against the food and drug administration for all their lies their litany
[02:53:29.120 --> 02:53:34.400]  of lies about the the fact the drug they said it was a vaccine it's not they said it was safe
[02:53:34.400 --> 02:53:39.120]  it's not they said it was effective it's not their own research proved it they had no lawful
[02:53:39.120 --> 02:53:44.480]  right to say so but they're claiming they have an emergency exception authority that removes them
[02:53:44.480 --> 02:53:50.960]  from any legislative oversight any judicial oversight any right to sue them ever uh so there's
[02:53:50.960 --> 02:53:55.680]  a lot of big issues that go beyond coveted implicated in that case and so but uh why are
[02:53:55.680 --> 02:53:59.680]  they so desperate to go there because they know they would lose on the facts same thing in the
[02:53:59.680 --> 02:54:04.960]  brook jackson case against fizer but fizer's desperate for no discovery to occur if they
[02:54:04.960 --> 02:54:10.480]  thought the discovery would vindicate their actions they wouldn't be desperate to hide it all
[02:54:10.480 --> 02:54:14.960]  from brook jackson and the public uh so the judge there is going to decide can we get to
[02:54:14.960 --> 02:54:19.520]  discover or not so we're going to find out whether the courts are willing to step up to the plate
[02:54:19.520 --> 02:54:24.960]  carry lake in arizona same thing i mean they're the uh obama judge sanctioned her lawyers for
[02:54:24.960 --> 02:54:29.920]  raising issues before the election that turned out to be exactly the problem at the election
[02:54:29.920 --> 02:54:35.600]  the tabulator machines not working correctly conveniently when republicans were voting in mass
[02:54:35.600 --> 02:54:42.240]  so we're seeing it instance after instance can our judiciary step up to the plate and resist
[02:54:42.240 --> 02:54:47.840]  the power of the deep state big corporations corrupt election officials etc uh big tech
[02:54:47.840 --> 02:54:53.760]  sensors you know i mean i agree so in closing the deep states cornered they're in trouble humanity
[02:54:53.760 --> 02:54:59.440]  is waking up worldwide what curveballs can they throw what what's the deep state going to pull
[02:54:59.440 --> 02:55:05.360]  trying to stay in power anything and everything so right now they're really banking on courts
[02:55:05.360 --> 02:55:10.080]  being cowards and not stepping up to resist them in all these different contexts so like
[02:55:10.080 --> 02:55:14.960]  the carry lake case that she has a very compelling case for an election contest if that election
[02:55:14.960 --> 02:55:18.880]  contest is not allowed to go forward that's a failure of the courts to do their job and affirm
[02:55:18.880 --> 02:55:24.880]  their oaths the same is true in the trump context trying to take over his business in new york
[02:55:24.880 --> 02:55:29.920]  so a canned court step in at some level and say hold on a second this has gone too far in the
[02:55:29.920 --> 02:55:34.560]  alex jones cases when they're on appeal when they're in front of the bankruptcy court will some court
[02:55:34.560 --> 02:55:39.040]  step forward and say hold on a second we've got to affirm the law we've got to affirm the higher
[02:55:39.040 --> 02:55:44.000]  principles we can't get caught up in the politics of these cases and allow our legal system to be
[02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:49.280]  weaponized to take out dissidents uh and hopefully and i mean they're going to push back against
[02:55:49.280 --> 02:55:55.040]  elan must disclosing all this information about twitter because as the the lawsuit about big tech
[02:55:55.040 --> 02:56:01.440]  government collusion exposed last week the at the fbi was intricately involved in censoring
[02:56:01.440 --> 02:56:08.800]  dissidents under the guise of national security so it's exposed to the world the need for massive
[02:56:08.800 --> 02:56:16.640]  reform and exactly the left criticizes if the left criticizes mccarthy what what what they've
[02:56:16.640 --> 02:56:22.480]  done them and caught doing with big tech is like a hundred times bigger oh absolutely if it's mccarthy
[02:56:22.480 --> 02:56:28.160]  on scale it's mccarthyism on scale and mccarthy focused on the government he didn't focus like
[02:56:28.160 --> 02:56:33.440]  democrats did on on the distance within their own party it was the house on american activities
[02:56:33.440 --> 02:56:38.240]  committee that did the real bad stuff associated with mccarthyism more so than mccarthy himself
[02:56:38.240 --> 02:56:42.320]  and the they're just replicating it they're repeating it they're redesigning it recreating
[02:56:42.320 --> 02:56:46.800]  it reimposing it and so we're at a critical juncture because so much of their effort has
[02:56:46.800 --> 02:56:52.160]  been exposed thanks to the audience at info wars supporting info wars keeping it on the air wasn't

[02:59:02.000 --> 02:59:08.400]  vapors with cold weather of course it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people
[02:59:08.400 --> 02:59:16.480]  what was killing people was a lack of vitamin d3 you see the sun via your skin helps your body
[02:59:16.480 --> 02:59:22.400]  produce vitamin d3 but if you're not getting enough sun you will not produce vitamin d3
[02:59:22.400 --> 02:59:26.560]  and then it's very easy for viruses and other things to start replicating and taking your body

[02:59:51.680 --> 03:00:08.080]  lies of the new world order it's alex jones live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex
[03:00:08.080 --> 03:00:18.320]  jones look i know this broadcast is overwhelming it's overwhelming for me
[03:00:23.120 --> 03:00:27.520]  but i gotta continue on because i can't just go off air and go hide in some ditch and wait for
[03:00:27.520 --> 03:00:34.320]  them to come for me they're planning new lockdowns they're planning every form of societal control
[03:00:34.320 --> 03:00:40.080]  we can imagine because good people have become decadent we become distracted we've been raised
[03:00:40.640 --> 03:00:46.320]  the age of television the internet we don't know what set us and the globalists have the
[03:00:46.320 --> 03:00:51.440]  argument that we deserve what's about to happen to us we deserve it
[03:00:55.760 --> 03:01:01.280]  because if we are these dumbasses and even while we're being attacked with bio weapons
[03:01:01.280 --> 03:01:07.280]  through so-called vaccines if we put up with that we deserve what happens to us well i don't
[03:01:07.280 --> 03:01:11.680]  deserve what's happened to me and my children don't deserve it and i'm not going along with this but
[03:01:11.680 --> 03:01:16.960]  i gotta tell you people are fighting back and we've tried to keep this peaceful i want to keep it
[03:01:16.960 --> 03:01:25.120]  peaceful but in brazil things are about to get hot we're gonna cover that coming up the next segment
[03:01:25.120 --> 03:01:31.440]  but this is really a question of who has the will
[03:01:32.960 --> 03:01:37.520]  to be free or who are those that want to delude themselves just live one day the next and
[03:01:38.080 --> 03:01:41.600]  ignore the fact that the waters of tyranny are rising all around us
[03:01:43.280 --> 03:01:49.360]  now separately i just did two hours with hotep jesus and robert barnes i got so focused
[03:01:49.360 --> 03:01:54.960]  on the news and information i didn't plug and that's in talk radio or anywhere
[03:01:56.480 --> 03:02:02.000]  most the advertising goes on during the segments so the biggest problem of info
[03:02:02.000 --> 03:02:07.840]  wars being on the verge of collapse is me not plugging i'll try to do a good job now

[03:06:13.680 --> 03:06:21.760]  well so does he lie from austin texas broadcasting world wide it's alex jones
[03:06:24.320 --> 03:06:29.120]  all right just a few minutes your salinity is about to take over but i wanted to hit a few
[03:06:29.120 --> 03:06:34.080]  other items that i mentioned but hadn't drilled into and the big one and i've looked at this it's
[03:06:34.080 --> 03:06:39.520]  true gateway planets reporting on it lula stole the election the evidence is overwhelming just
[03:06:39.520 --> 03:06:44.640]  like here they're trying to social credit score through the government because bolson our own
[03:06:44.640 --> 03:06:51.600]  never got full control they have the cps take people's children or use social credit scores
[03:06:51.600 --> 03:06:55.600]  to take their bank accounts if they protest the election whether they're right or wrong
[03:06:56.880 --> 03:07:02.320]  they should have a right to do that so here's the headline brazil military kills red command
[03:07:02.320 --> 03:07:08.880]  cartel leaders prepares for takeover it goes on to show the military town the public
[03:07:08.880 --> 03:07:14.240]  be peaceful when we take action to stay in place and do not be violent they've now gone and killed
[03:07:15.280 --> 03:07:19.600]  the two major drug cartel leaders who admittedly are allied with the government
[03:07:19.600 --> 03:07:26.160]  since the mid-1970s and so it's clear that lula can't even get a thousand people out of
[03:07:26.160 --> 03:07:32.880]  a demonstration for him just like bidenkin but they'll have crowds of five six million people
[03:07:32.880 --> 03:07:39.920]  in major cities for bolson our own and we saw the state department and big tech involved in
[03:07:39.920 --> 03:07:45.520]  it laying the election as well it's in the constitution in brazil that if two branches
[03:07:45.520 --> 03:07:54.320]  of government or more get in a heated locked battle the military will get involved and so
[03:07:54.320 --> 03:07:59.200]  that's basically what's happening there right now i don't want the military deciding elections
[03:07:59.200 --> 03:08:03.440]  and our military is controlled by the globalist here so that's not going to happen anyways
[03:08:04.080 --> 03:08:09.680]  but in brazil they are overall against the corruption against the drug dealing against
[03:08:09.680 --> 03:08:16.320]  the communists who have been so incredibly corrupt the story continue to watch that situation
[03:08:16.960 --> 03:08:25.040]  as it unfolds but this is obviously a big big big deal then i had this newscast
[03:08:25.040 --> 03:08:30.720]  that we're going to play here in a moment local authorities shut down virginia business a restaurant
[03:08:31.520 --> 03:08:38.320]  two years after violating state covet policy so owner matt strickland filmed the entire raid
[03:08:38.320 --> 03:08:43.200]  and shamed them for being puppets of the regime this is in virginia with the state police and
[03:08:43.200 --> 03:08:50.560]  local police coming into his restaurant and saying you're shut down for three months because
[03:08:50.560 --> 03:08:57.040]  a couple years ago you didn't lock down now all the big restaurants can stay open all the walmarts
[03:08:57.040 --> 03:09:03.280]  can stay open the liquor stores can stay open but you're not essential as a restaurant that's not a
[03:09:03.280 --> 03:09:10.560]  chain you've got to close which again is part of the plan that we talked about earlier it's official
[03:09:10.560 --> 03:09:16.000]  france bands short-haul domestic flights in favor of trains private jets are fined but the general
[03:09:16.000 --> 03:09:21.920]  public can't go get charter planes or fly commercial anymore netherlands police use heavy machinery
[03:09:21.920 --> 03:09:26.480]  overturn tractors they don't want their farms shut down this is not the environment this is
[03:09:26.480 --> 03:09:34.960]  communists taking over the food supply cutting off the pipelines and the infrastructure so let's
[03:09:34.960 --> 03:09:41.120]  play this chilling clip out of virginia understanding this is the criminality these people and that
[03:09:41.120 --> 03:09:45.840]  they're still trying to prosecute four shots for the military they're still trying to bring back
[03:09:45.840 --> 03:09:50.320]  more lockdowns they're still trying to bring back mass mandates we're never going to get out of this
[03:09:50.320 --> 03:09:55.600]  until we prosecute and confront the people that have done this here's the clip of the poor business
[03:09:55.600 --> 03:10:00.800]  owner who they're trying to bankrupt actually been found to be detrimental to the community
[03:10:00.800 --> 03:10:06.400]  but you're still going to shut a man's business down over there you're not here to discuss whether
[03:10:06.400 --> 03:10:14.880]  or not you're not here to discuss whether or not the unconscious you're just here to do your job right
[03:10:19.680 --> 03:10:25.520]  and you're gonna force that regardless right yeah so you're part of the problem man i want you to
[03:10:25.520 --> 03:10:29.280]  know that you're part of the problem you're part of the problem you're part of the problem
[03:10:30.320 --> 03:10:34.560]  you're part of the problem everybody in here every one of you man what's going on in this
[03:10:34.560 --> 03:10:39.520]  country right now the reason that we're in the situation we're in as united states of america
[03:10:39.520 --> 03:10:44.880]  you're part of the problem sir so you can't complain about what the president is doing you

[03:11:26.960 --> 03:11:33.040]  anything anything to prevent covid and it was actually detrimental to the community and not

[03:29:01.920 --> 03:29:08.000]  believe that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter because of something called
[03:29:08.000 --> 03:29:14.880]  vapors they associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather of course it wasn't the cold
[03:29:14.880 --> 03:29:20.560]  weather or catching a chill that killed people what was killing people was a lack of vitamin

[03:31:13.520 --> 03:31:18.240]  and the school shutdowns and and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible
[03:31:18.960 --> 03:31:24.640]  made any resistance to it possible was people continuing to support info wars despite the
[03:31:24.640 --> 03:31:30.640]  massive lawfare being waged against info wars despite the media defamatory libelous campaign
[03:31:30.640 --> 03:31:36.320]  against info wars the ordinary people the everyday people that buy products that make their own

[03:33:00.560 --> 03:33:26.800]  the lies of the new world order it's alex jones the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the
[03:33:26.800 --> 03:33:37.520]  alex jones show with gerald solente great being on the alex jones show and again we're in very
[03:33:37.520 --> 03:33:46.400]  very critical times world war three has already begun we go back to our trends journal covers
[03:33:47.280 --> 03:33:52.800]  covid war ukrain war world war that was two days before russia invaded again we're totally opposed
[03:33:52.800 --> 03:33:59.760]  to russia's invasion totally understand why as i said when all else fails they take you to war
[03:33:59.760 --> 03:34:08.880]  and war war three has begun world war two followed the great depression uh what happened with the
[03:34:08.880 --> 03:34:19.600]  dot com bust oh the war on terror that changed our lives yep and everybody forgot about the dot
[03:34:19.600 --> 03:34:28.320]  com crash the nasdaq was down 66 day before 9 11 so what we're saying is you better prepare
[03:34:28.320 --> 03:34:33.760]  prevail and prosper and info wars can help you do that with a lot of the products that they sell
[03:34:33.760 --> 03:34:38.000]  them of course with our magazine the trends journal you know we're giving you history before it
[03:34:38.000 --> 03:34:44.400]  happens we forecast what's going on we don't take sides on things we're political atheists
[03:34:44.400 --> 03:34:51.120]  and so going back to the economy when i went on the air the dow was down about 500 points
[03:34:52.480 --> 03:35:00.560]  and it's down because there's fear that they're going to raise interest rates more than 50 basis
[03:35:00.560 --> 03:35:09.120]  points so this is the from cnbc stocks fell monday on fears that the federal reserve may
[03:35:09.120 --> 03:35:14.560]  continue tightening until it steers the economy into a recession
[03:35:17.920 --> 03:35:23.360]  wait a minute until it steers the economy into a recession
[03:35:25.600 --> 03:35:32.000]  so it hurts just the small people as the bigs get bigger and buy up everything like they did
[03:35:32.000 --> 03:35:39.360]  with the housing bust and all of those firms have started buying homes and then people can't
[03:35:39.360 --> 03:35:45.440]  afford to rent a buy a home and they rent it to them that didn't happen before this
[03:35:46.960 --> 03:35:53.120]  and now the bigs these big private equity groups and the rest they control about 37
[03:35:53.120 --> 03:36:00.160]  percent 30 percent of the housing that they're buying up so put it into a recession and there's
[03:36:00.160 --> 03:36:08.160]  no blowback about this let's get this straight everybody i know you krugman you just spew out
[03:36:08.160 --> 03:36:19.520]  crap so you got it wrong it had nothing to do with supply chain disruptions and other crap
[03:36:20.400 --> 03:36:26.640]  that the mainstream media spews out that brought up the inflation rate
[03:36:26.640 --> 03:36:34.400]  it's to cheap money backed by nothing and printed on nothing that the government
[03:36:35.840 --> 03:36:43.200]  and the fed banksters pumped into the economy to keep the money junkies high they pump in
[03:36:43.200 --> 03:36:55.200]  that monetary method on that's what caused inflation not supply chain disruptions and all
[03:36:55.200 --> 03:37:01.440]  the other crap you're shooting out of your mouth oh but we're gonna bring the nation into recession
[03:37:02.160 --> 03:37:09.280]  so the hell with the little people they can rot in hell the bigs will get bigger and buy out more
[03:37:09.280 --> 03:37:19.760]  like alex jones said they closed down all the small businesses hey but walmart you're essential
[03:37:19.760 --> 03:37:31.840]  you know target you're essential but mom and pop you count for nothing you're nothing this is america
[03:37:32.800 --> 03:37:35.680]  a n e r i k a
[03:37:35.680 --> 03:37:51.440]  day fascism according to musolini is the merger of state and corporate powers welcome aboard
[03:37:54.400 --> 03:38:03.200]  to run an election in america you better get a lot of money from the bigs yeah like that little uh
[03:38:03.200 --> 03:38:14.320]  uh beto boy beto boy down in texas a loser you lost a hundred million bucks almost huh
[03:38:14.320 --> 03:38:19.920]  a hundred million dollars almost to run for governor and the other clown over there in georgia
[03:38:21.040 --> 03:38:26.320]  losing abrams or whatever name is a hundred million bucks
[03:38:26.320 --> 03:38:35.360]  and then they make up garbage like the inflation reduction act talking about fascism
[03:38:36.320 --> 03:38:42.000]  and we'll give those companies big money to build the plants all the air to make chips
[03:38:43.040 --> 03:38:48.720]  yeah we're gonna steal your money and give it to them and we're gonna print it up
[03:38:48.720 --> 03:38:55.040]  billions billions and billions that's what's bringing inflation up
[03:38:56.480 --> 03:39:03.440]  and here they admit they're looking to bring the country into recession they could care about
[03:39:03.440 --> 03:39:11.120]  they want little business to go out of business so the new world order takes over more and more
[03:39:11.120 --> 03:39:20.880]  of all the orders coming in that's right where's the outrage hey how about that world cup huh
[03:39:22.720 --> 03:39:23.920]  that's what people talk about
[03:39:26.480 --> 03:39:35.920]  anyway the spirit of 1776 that is what we have to be in and the first one to me
[03:39:35.920 --> 03:39:42.080]  me is the fight because we're in the fight for our lives and before I get into that I want to
[03:39:42.080 --> 03:39:51.520]  stay on the market they raise interest rates 75 basis points there's going to be a housing decline
[03:39:52.240 --> 03:39:59.440]  but we don't see a crash but it's the prices go down 20 25 percent they want to 40 and they'll
[03:39:59.440 --> 03:40:06.880]  bounce back because inflation is going to keep going number two the biggest crash you're going
[03:40:06.880 --> 03:40:14.720]  to see in the economic sector is in commercial offices people are not going back to work the
[03:40:14.720 --> 03:40:20.640]  way they used to so even if they bring it back to a 75 occupancy rate people going back to work
[03:40:20.640 --> 03:40:27.440]  you're still down 25 percent and now when interest rates go up now you got to pay more on the loans
[03:40:27.440 --> 03:40:33.360]  that you have and then this goes global and that's what we do with the trends journals global
[03:40:33.360 --> 03:40:42.720]  nomin all of these emerging markets they borrowed money in dollars interest rates go up the dollar
[03:40:42.720 --> 03:40:48.720]  gets strong and not because the country is so strong because the other currencies are so weak
[03:40:48.720 --> 03:40:57.680]  that's why the dollar is strong so now they have to pay more on their debt what does it mean you
[03:40:57.680 --> 03:41:05.760]  think you got a refugee crisis now ain't seen anything yet you're going to see demonstrations
[03:41:06.720 --> 03:41:14.480]  riots civil unrest across the globe as people take to the streets and lack of basic living
[03:41:14.480 --> 03:41:20.320]  stand government corruption crime and violence you're going to want to stay there no you want to
[03:41:20.320 --> 03:41:30.480]  leave now put on top of that all the damage they did with the covid war and the businesses and

[03:43:57.440 --> 03:44:04.480]  in arizona i think we watched the election be uh stolen slowly stolen day by day counting these
[03:44:04.480 --> 03:44:11.760]  mail-in ballots and it's absolutely absurd for anyone to take our election seriously when we
[03:44:11.760 --> 03:44:18.720]  we just it's election month alex it's not election day and that's the problem and everything changed
[03:44:18.720 --> 03:44:26.240]  after COVID-19 they illegally changed state elections mailing ballots to anyone and everyone
[03:44:26.240 --> 03:44:31.520]  and sometimes mailing multiple ballots to people well this isn't any way to run an election we're
[03:44:31.520 --> 03:44:36.960]  in a serious country when we have elections that can be stolen like this and i believe that just
[03:44:36.960 --> 03:44:42.720]  like i believe the election was stolen in 2020 and i have no problem saying that and it's it is so
[03:44:42.720 --> 03:44:48.880]  absurd for the media and the democrats to attack us that question our election integrity and question
[03:44:48.880 --> 03:44:55.760]  the the fact that elections shouldn't be run the way they are we're not election deniers we're election

[03:50:55.360 --> 03:51:02.400]  that I could use but I want to see what else they're saying so this is the story the top story in the
[03:51:04.560 --> 03:51:11.360]  on the cartoon news network dementia risks may increase if you're eating these foods
[03:51:12.000 --> 03:51:18.080]  study says again before I go into that again goes back to the products that info wars is
[03:51:18.080 --> 03:51:26.560]  selling and why you need so many of those this is how they begin it sandy limote or Lamati I don't
[03:51:26.560 --> 03:51:39.920]  know MOTTE ready quote we all eat them wait a minute wait a minute this is not journalism
[03:51:39.920 --> 03:51:51.760]  let's start with the first three were four words we not we not we people who eat crap
[03:51:55.600 --> 03:52:04.480]  we all eat them ultra processed foods such as frozen pizza and ready to eat meals
[03:52:04.480 --> 03:52:19.280]  make our busy lives much easier how stupid can you be how stupid can you be eat crap
[03:52:22.880 --> 03:52:30.800]  but what's the headline dementia risks may increase if you're eating these foods and you say
[03:52:30.800 --> 03:52:38.800]  ready to eat meals make our busy lives eat oh people were never busy before no no no
[03:52:39.440 --> 03:52:52.560]  no only now and you ready besides they are just darn tasty darn tasty you're darn stupid she goes on to
[03:52:52.560 --> 03:53:09.920]  say about who is insusceptible the hot dogs cookies cakes candy donuts ice cream and again
[03:53:09.920 --> 03:53:16.560]  ultra processors such as frozen pizza a is no way in the world
[03:53:16.560 --> 03:53:27.600]  that a napolitan or born on the Bronx would eat this frozen stuff that you call pizza pizza head
[03:53:29.120 --> 03:53:38.400]  this is the way they sell this stuff and then you go on to read this 58% of the calories consumed
[03:53:38.400 --> 03:53:50.080]  by United States citizens 56.8% of the calories consumed by British citizens
[03:53:50.960 --> 03:53:58.240]  and 48% of the calories consumed by Canadians come from ultra processed foods according to the
[03:53:58.240 --> 03:54:10.880]  study ultra processed crap to me when they nuked the nuclear family that was the end 40% of Americans
[03:54:10.880 --> 03:54:19.040]  are obese my mother may have sold rest in peace there's seven kids she's home all day cooking
[03:54:19.040 --> 03:54:30.800]  and she's raising the family rather than sending us to a daycare center with other little strangers
[03:54:31.440 --> 03:54:39.360]  and feeding us crap and learn to eat crap all our lives and then say you're so damn stupid
[03:54:39.360 --> 03:54:47.520]  that you're too busy to eat fine food that's one of the things by the way that's going to be
[03:54:47.520 --> 03:55:00.240]  the spirit of 1776 dine fine yep you do it at home oh you can't afford to cook i can make resort though
[03:55:01.440 --> 03:55:05.680]  by the best the best resort though best rice
[03:55:05.680 --> 03:55:15.280]  feed six people for under ten dollars and why
[03:55:18.160 --> 03:55:21.200]  because then they have another story that's out making the news
[03:55:22.320 --> 03:55:27.840]  money where your mouth is paying obese people cash to lose weight doubles their rate of fat
[03:55:27.840 --> 03:55:32.560]  loss study shows paying obese people lose weight doubles their rate of fat loss
[03:55:32.560 --> 03:55:39.760]  blah blah blah researchers test blah blah blah they can't pay them you got it backwards
[03:55:40.480 --> 03:55:47.200]  if i'm elected i want a fat tax the more you weigh the more you pay i don't want to pay for your
[03:55:48.320 --> 03:55:57.680]  being too busy to cook good food and eat crap because you're driving up all the bills
[03:55:57.680 --> 03:56:06.240]  that cost the health care because 70 percent of americans are overweight
[03:56:09.840 --> 03:56:17.760]  and 42 percent obese so the more you weigh the more you pay oh and as you lose weight
[03:56:17.760 --> 03:56:24.320]  do the opposite paying obese people cash no you can pay less yeah oh you'll be fine
[03:56:24.320 --> 03:56:30.560]  you'll be happy and healthy everything will be great and i gotta pay for this i gotta pay for this
[03:56:33.520 --> 03:56:33.840]  yep
[03:56:37.360 --> 03:56:42.000]  and again goes back all things are connected the products they give you at info wars
[03:56:43.280 --> 03:56:48.080]  they're very good for your health so that's one of the things that we're going to be talking about

[03:56:55.200 --> 03:57:02.800]  but disobeying the chinese rules the chinese way you must obey on covid lockdowns he said it's strong
[03:57:03.840 --> 03:57:11.520]  it's up to everybody to do something don't complain don't complain do something whatever you do
