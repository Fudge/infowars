[00:00.000 --> 00:22.960]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex
[00:22.960 --> 00:52.880]  Jones it is Wednesday January 8th 2020 I am your host Alex
[00:52.880 --> 01:00.320]  Jones we're gonna be live here in this studio the next four hours and I am going to open the
[01:00.320 --> 01:10.320]  phones up and we'll be taking your calls before the bottom of the hour U.S. citizens of the
[01:10.320 --> 01:16.600]  United States U.S. citizens of other nations but all souls aboard this planet hurtling through
[01:16.600 --> 01:27.960]  space I want to get your take unfiltered uncensored live and raw on air to see what you think about
[01:27.960 --> 01:34.280]  the global geopolitical crises and how President Trump and how the Iranians have handled it the
[01:34.280 --> 01:43.120]  president just about five minutes ago completed a lengthy speech that went about 45 minutes where
[01:43.120 --> 01:52.160]  he attempted to de-escalate the situation with Iran we will be playing large excerpts of that
[01:52.160 --> 01:59.960]  speech today I have the transcript here he talked up the military talked up the U.S. economy was
[01:59.960 --> 02:11.320]  basic standard Trumpian fair and what he said about the Iranians being a large global paramilitary
[02:11.320 --> 02:16.720]  force that has been killing their opposition is true I don't think it's true to say they're the
[02:16.720 --> 02:20.760]  number one exporter of terror in the world we all know that Saudi Arabia which has been
[02:20.760 --> 02:27.240]  stopping that since Trump got into office dramatically so that's something good Trump's
[02:27.240 --> 02:33.600]  done there it's just not true that Iran is the biggest exporter of terror in the world we all
[02:33.600 --> 02:43.920]  know that's the majority Islam organization that is the Sunnis not the Shiites but I'm not gonna
[02:43.920 --> 02:50.040]  cry over Soleimani who they've built up in the media as a hero suddenly just a few years ago
[02:50.040 --> 02:56.760]  they were the bad guys when Assad supposedly need to be overthrown and of course it's the Muslim
[02:56.760 --> 03:04.280]  brotherhood that are the Sunnis that were working with Obama to about to basically take over much
[03:04.280 --> 03:11.280]  the Middle East but Obama was also working with Iran as well a lot of covert operations and so
[03:11.280 --> 03:17.040]  the final reason in my view and research has been fleshing that out as being correct my instinct
[03:17.040 --> 03:24.040]  is that Trump's really pissed at Kerry and Obama and the deep state using Iran to embarrass his
[03:24.040 --> 03:29.240]  administration and his attempt to pull us out of the Middle East and Trump called for NATO said
[03:29.240 --> 03:36.160]  hey you need you get a lot of money you're in Europe you're a lot closer to this problem you need
[03:36.160 --> 03:41.680]  to come in and you need to pay for it and you need to stabilize the Strait of Hormuz and we
[03:41.680 --> 03:48.000]  shouldn't be there paying for it we're energy independent in the United States for the first
[03:48.000 --> 03:54.360]  time ever because Trump took a bunch of regulations off that Obama had put there to make us where
[03:54.360 --> 04:00.320]  we weren't independent that's one reason and so we're a net exporter and we're the biggest
[04:00.320 --> 04:09.160]  exporter in the world drudge report boils it down well de-escalate standing down stocks soar
[04:09.160 --> 04:13.440]  Trump let's make a deal our missiles are bigger than yours he actually said that
[04:13.440 --> 04:20.720]  but Trump knows how to dumb it down I mean he's really smart behind the scenes that's hilarious
[04:20.720 --> 04:26.240]  my missiles bigger than yours it's like in space balls he goes my Swartz is bigger than your
[04:26.240 --> 04:34.880]  Swartz army warrants of draft hoax yeah the lefts been pushing that big time Iran the only gave
[04:34.880 --> 04:41.080]  you a slap and that's actually true but those missiles were real and if it wasn't for the
[04:41.080 --> 04:43.920]  Patriot missile systems they could have killed a lot of people fact part of the missiles hit
[04:43.920 --> 04:48.000]  the base we even broke that before it was later confirmed with satellite photos we have the
[04:48.000 --> 04:53.680]  exclusive photos at info wars dot com that were sent let's just say somebody that works in this
[04:53.680 --> 04:58.520]  office who has friends that work on the base so we've got all that coming up
[04:58.520 --> 05:06.680]  Owl killer in New Jersey you're on the air go ahead Alex hey I just want to say he's great to
[05:06.680 --> 05:10.200]  be back once again and I've never gotten to do this but I'm gonna give you a shout out for

[06:26.520 --> 06:32.720]  headlines accurately represent what Trump's speech about 12 minutes long the buildup was
[06:32.720 --> 06:40.240]  45 minutes of them with a live feed of the White House lectern or the winner White House
[06:40.240 --> 06:49.080]  show de-escalation standing down stock soar Trump let's make a deal our missiles bigger
[06:49.080 --> 06:56.400]  than yours army oren's of draft hoax Iran we only gave you a slap we're going to be hitting
[06:56.400 --> 07:02.640]  every angle of this today and I'm going to open the phones up right now so that listeners in
[07:02.640 --> 07:06.880]  the United States listeners in Iran listeners in the Middle East listeners in Europe listeners
[07:06.880 --> 07:12.320]  in Australia listeners in Africa listeners in Mexico everybody can call in and we did
[07:12.320 --> 07:17.440]  a really great job last night the crew did and Owen shroyer and Savannah Hernandez and
[07:17.440 --> 07:25.480]  others Greg Reese everybody that did live coverage until late in the evening Harrison
[07:25.480 --> 07:31.640]  Smith list goes on and on taking probably a hundred phone calls or so and but we did
[07:31.640 --> 07:37.280]  it by giving each person a minute and I've been doing a better job of not making people
[07:37.280 --> 07:40.920]  sit on hold for hours and actually getting to you but that means no matter how good your
[07:40.920 --> 07:46.360]  call is the very best calls we gave like two minutes even though they had incredible points
[07:46.360 --> 07:51.520]  to make and we're in the Middle East or in the military we just we just had to do it
[07:51.520 --> 08:01.520]  so we are going to give the number out it's 8777892539877789 Alex 8777892539 international
[08:01.520 --> 08:07.400]  call your country code and then 5126461776 there's obviously some international phone
[08:07.400 --> 08:12.960]  plans can't call 1 800 numbers most of them can but if you want to call in your own dime
[08:12.960 --> 08:22.400]  or need to its country code 5126461776 and let us know if you're calling on that line
[08:22.400 --> 08:30.520]  and it's on your dime and we will put you to the front of the line 51264617768777892539
[08:30.520 --> 08:37.160]  I had some other guests we were going to have today but I moved those to tomorrow so that
[08:37.160 --> 08:42.360]  you can really get a chance because personally I like the broadcast better when we take a
[08:42.360 --> 08:47.120]  lot of calls I think it takes us in directions that I wouldn't have taken us and the show
[08:47.120 --> 08:54.680]  is not stag the broadcast is explosive very dynamic and riveting at times but the calls
[08:54.680 --> 08:59.320]  add the true wild card that's why I told you going into 2020 we're going to increase the
[08:59.320 --> 09:03.720]  calls we're doing it folks love it the listeners love it so we're going to get even deeper
[09:03.720 --> 09:11.000]  into that Mike Adams is hosting the fourth hour and you know I almost preempted him today
[09:11.000 --> 09:16.680]  to play his new documentary on the dangers of 5G that's only 20 minutes long but I have
[09:16.680 --> 09:20.120]  a second suspicion he's probably going to play his documentary today though I'm not
[09:20.120 --> 09:25.600]  sure so it's just funny because I had forgotten who was hosting the fourth hour and I'm like
[09:25.600 --> 09:29.320]  hey I may preempt who's doing the fourth hour to play Mike Adams documentary they go well
[09:29.320 --> 09:36.040]  it's Mike Adams I go oh okay show we'll definitely have all that for it's posted on the front
[09:36.040 --> 09:41.720]  page of info wars dot com right now and the Mike Adams section of natural news that we
[09:41.720 --> 09:47.320]  have right there at band dot video entire counter think section with Mike Adams definitely
[09:47.320 --> 09:53.200]  want to get that definitely want to share that it is so important that's the counter
[09:53.200 --> 10:03.760]  think section there's actually another section for Mike okay let me just pull back here and
[10:03.760 --> 10:07.320]  give my perspective on this I'm going to play some of Trump's speech and then we're going
[10:07.320 --> 10:15.280]  to go to your phone calls I like having a president that's got the establishment pissed
[10:15.280 --> 10:18.560]  I like having a president that actually makes the decisions himself and isn't controlled
[10:18.560 --> 10:23.680]  by a bunch of lackeys I like a president who says our country is good and that we should
[10:23.680 --> 10:27.920]  have a border and that we should have a second amendment and that our national sovereignty
[10:27.920 --> 10:32.800]  is important I like having a nation that says we shouldn't be the police from the world
[10:32.800 --> 10:38.660]  and Trump is trying to make the nation you know be that country that I think is what
[10:38.660 --> 10:42.760]  follows our bill of rights and constitution that made it so successful that said he's
[10:42.760 --> 10:46.160]  going to be pulled by different forces and he's going to be presented with information
[10:46.160 --> 10:51.040]  sometimes that he thinks is accurate and it's going to make decisions that aren't going
[10:51.040 --> 10:57.760]  to be perfect I don't like the neo cons pushing for water war I don't like the left who's
[10:57.760 --> 11:01.400]  usually for every war that comes along and has been mad at Trump because he's tried to
[11:01.400 --> 11:10.000]  pull out of Syria and Afghanistan suddenly flying Iranian flags Iranian flag emojis on
[11:10.000 --> 11:17.640]  Twitter and Facebook and siding with Iran and having mullahs on and Islamic leaders who
[11:17.640 --> 11:23.200]  have called for the destruction of the United States the destruction of Israel who've called
[11:23.200 --> 11:28.920]  for shooting American hostages who've called for killing Americans all over the world and
[11:28.920 --> 11:35.360]  just sick of fanically worshiping the authoritarian regime of Tehran that has killed thousands
[11:35.360 --> 11:39.920]  and thousands of people just the last month mowing them down the streets massive assassinations
[11:39.920 --> 11:43.560]  of anybody that doesn't submit women being beaten and put in prison that don't wear a
[11:43.560 --> 11:48.600]  jibs and the left that's always telling us that America is bad and Christianity is bad
[11:48.600 --> 11:54.360]  and we oppress women sick of fanically worshiping something that basically puts garbage bags
[11:54.360 --> 12:01.760]  over women or beekeeper suits it fundamentally scares me pisses me off it makes me revile
[12:01.760 --> 12:12.320]  it and you know I live in Austin I went last night after I got off air at 9 o'clock and
[12:12.320 --> 12:20.000]  Greg Reese and others took over and I pulled into a mom-and-pop hamburger place and there
[12:20.000 --> 12:25.960]  wasn't one group of Muslims in there there were two groups on separate sides at a place
[12:25.960 --> 12:30.080]  I've been eating hamburgers since I was five years old I should drive down here with my
[12:30.080 --> 12:37.600]  parents when I was a kid go with my grandfather to Dan's hamburgers over off of Ben White
[12:37.600 --> 12:44.360]  and Manchak Montaca and and it's not that I hate those people it's that anywhere Islam
[12:44.360 --> 12:50.640]  becomes 10% of the population they begin pushing everyone else out they they begin conquering
[12:50.640 --> 12:58.720]  everyone and I can't go to Iran and be free I can't go to Saudi Arabia and be free I can't
[12:58.720 --> 13:03.000]  go to almost any Islamic country and be free and every other Islamic country that borders
[13:03.000 --> 13:10.040]  a Christian country or a or a Buddhist country is attacking it can you didn't use to have
[13:10.040 --> 13:16.120]  any Muslims now it's being taken over by same thing with a lot of these countries and Islam
[13:16.120 --> 13:24.040]  has been expanding for over a thousand years and we almost lost Europe to it Turkey used
[13:24.040 --> 13:28.520]  to be the Holy Roman Empire's Eastern Empire it got taken over the men killed the women
[13:28.520 --> 13:37.080]  put on slave ships and sold all over the world and so it's a group conquering people and
[13:37.080 --> 13:40.320]  they're very arrogant on average they're very full of themselves and they think they have
[13:40.320 --> 13:45.800]  a right to rule me well you don't have a right to rule me now that said I was against the
[13:45.800 --> 13:49.680]  wars going in the Middle East because they were adventurous and they were removing people
[13:49.680 --> 13:53.520]  that were a lot better than what the globalist were putting in because the globalist were
[13:53.520 --> 13:57.920]  wanting to destabilize Islam to break its borders put radicals in and then use it as
[13:57.920 --> 14:07.960]  a weapon against the West so this is a very sophisticated problem we face but it'd be
[14:07.960 --> 14:20.520]  like if I was say Jewish and Germany was 1939 Germany and I was in another country let's
[14:20.520 --> 14:26.160]  say Paris and I'm in a restaurant and then there's a couple Nazis in there I would be
[14:26.160 --> 14:31.880]  uncomfortable and it's the fact that I didn't used to see Muslims anywhere if I go to say
[14:31.880 --> 14:39.200]  Barton Creek Mall sometimes it'll be it's seven at night hundreds of women in full
[14:39.200 --> 14:45.120]  burkas I'll be sitting there in restaurants on a routine basis I walk in and I can't eat
[14:45.120 --> 14:48.840]  my dinner I'm there with my daughters and the Muslims are looking at my daughters because
[14:48.840 --> 14:54.040]  they're not wearing a jibs and their women have full full face mask on they have to take
[14:54.040 --> 15:04.640]  the fork and eat under it they're in Halloween costumes and and I don't like it we don't
[15:04.640 --> 15:09.560]  wear Halloween costumes in America unless it's Halloween we don't make women wear bags
[15:09.560 --> 15:15.760]  over their heads and then the left sycophantically loving it and promoting it and coddling it
[15:15.760 --> 15:20.520]  and making sure little girls wear full face mask in school and little girls take them
[15:20.520 --> 15:26.600]  off in the school reports of their parents and they get beaten that's sick and the left
[15:26.600 --> 15:33.280]  sick they're sick evil filth and pedophilia is rampant in Islam so here's the thing it's
[15:33.280 --> 15:38.360]  like somebody feed me poison I'm throwing it up so that's where I stand on this is that
[15:38.360 --> 15:42.840]  the real threat is the open borders and Trump's been trying to shut the massive Islamic surge
[15:42.840 --> 15:47.640]  of this country that Obama started down and that's why I support Trump go back to their
[15:47.640 --> 15:53.440]  own Islamic countries where they live in the stone ages and murder your women and do whatever
[15:53.440 --> 15:58.040]  you want to stay the hell out of my country.

[18:01.560 --> 18:06.520]  I hadn't tried it except for maybe the last week and a half and I told Alex I said man
[18:06.520 --> 18:09.760]  this is the best toothpaste I've ever tried he's like well what are you doing just sitting
[18:09.760 --> 18:13.520]  in here telling me you got to get up there and tell people and oh so here I am telling
[18:13.520 --> 18:19.720]  people super silver whitening toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste I've ever tried
[18:19.720 --> 18:23.640]  and I'm 45 years old and I've tried a lot of different toothpaste and it's fluoride
[18:23.640 --> 18:28.800]  free I think the big difference the game changer in this is the coral calcium because after
[18:28.800 --> 18:33.400]  I brush my teeth with this they feel so clean and the toothpaste that I don't even like
[18:33.400 --> 18:38.960]  rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this it feels so good it feels like it feels
[18:38.960 --> 18:45.000]  like good things are happening in my mouth in fact I find myself brushing my teeth three
[18:45.000 --> 18:58.720]  to four times a day rather than just twice a day now because I like the way it feels.
[18:58.720 --> 19:01.920]  The best product I'm not supposed to be biased but I'm going to tell you all now if you haven't
[19:01.920 --> 19:07.280]  tried turbo force you need to try it I've tried turbo force with everything sometimes
[19:07.280 --> 19:11.200]  you know I went a little bit crazy I put turbo force in my coffee that was a crazy week I
[19:11.200 --> 19:14.800]  don't remember sleeping but as far as the products go turbo force is my favorite and
[19:14.800 --> 19:18.240]  all the infowars products are down to take control of your life take control of your
[19:18.240 --> 19:25.560]  health not relying on other people to do it for you nobody wakes up in the morning and
[19:25.560 --> 19:28.600]  thinks I'm going to give that person over there a better life I'm going to wake up today
[19:28.600 --> 19:32.520]  you know what I'm going to spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier
[19:32.520 --> 19:36.000]  happier and richer I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend I don't
[19:36.000 --> 19:38.800]  think that happens very often it's never happened to me I've never had anyone knock
[19:38.800 --> 19:42.440]  on my door and said Tate you're such a good guy how can I improve your life in every single
[19:42.440 --> 19:46.360]  way there's only one person who woke up and thought man that was me I woke up and thought

[19:49.640 --> 19:52.280]  and that's why you need to go to infowars.com take control of your health right now and
[19:52.280 --> 19:55.880]  support the resistance don't buy into the group think don't drink the Kool-Aid drink
[19:55.880 --> 20:03.520]  the turbo force Kool-Aid is bad and the turbo force is good you're listening to the Alex
[20:03.520 --> 20:19.880]  Jones show
[20:19.880 --> 20:26.880]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's Alex Jones
[20:26.880 --> 20:32.400]  all right I needed to go to the beginning of Trump's speech that he just completed about
[20:32.400 --> 20:36.800]  30 minutes ago in the last segment but I went into a rant about the Islamification of the
[20:36.800 --> 20:43.920]  West and now the two things just are not compatible and how they're not adopting our ways they're
[20:43.920 --> 20:48.240]  trying to make us adopt their ways and it's a fact and the globalists are trying to force
[20:48.240 --> 20:53.880]  this on us because they see Islam in an alliance with socialism and collectivism and that will
[20:53.880 --> 21:00.080]  give up our basic freedoms to the collective estate that will then referee what's left
[21:00.080 --> 21:05.560]  of western culture with the Islamic takeover by the way Dave Chappelle came out in an award
[21:05.560 --> 21:09.880]  speech last night and gave a really powerful speech and I'm going to air some excerpts
[21:09.880 --> 21:17.280]  of that coming up the start of the next hour and to tie it in to Ricky Graves who really
[21:17.280 --> 21:25.280]  symbolizes the fall of Hollywood and how when the only popular actors only popular comedians
[21:25.280 --> 21:30.560]  are saying how pathetic Hollywood is and how evil it is and how you better hope there isn't
[21:30.560 --> 21:37.240]  a second amendment revolution that's what Chappelle said they know that's what's popular
[21:37.240 --> 21:42.440]  they're not just stepping out and saying that because it's what they believe yes I know folks
[21:42.440 --> 21:46.440]  that they know Dave Chappelle he knows about the globalist the Illuminati the new world
[21:46.440 --> 21:51.080]  order he doesn't like him he's a good guy but he wouldn't be doing this now unless he knew
[21:51.080 --> 21:58.560]  the time was right same thing with Ricky Graves and the rest of it so they are falling apart
[21:58.560 --> 22:05.360]  the system is super unpopular and I go back to Joe Rogan's podcast he was arguably the
[22:05.360 --> 22:11.680]  biggest long-form podcast three years ago when he finally had me on this show invited
[22:11.680 --> 22:17.120]  me on and that was the biggest podcast he'd ever done to that point then he waits two
[22:17.120 --> 22:22.960]  years to have me back on and it becomes the all-time biggest even bigger than Elon Musk
[22:22.960 --> 22:33.800]  40 something million total views now that's as big as a football playoff game a football
[22:33.800 --> 22:40.520]  playoff game makes about a hundred billion dollars in advertising I bet Joe Rogan made
[22:40.520 --> 22:45.880]  a hundred thousand dollars when I came on maybe more but it just shows how it's the
[22:45.880 --> 22:52.840]  NFL it's a hundred million but if you have the same viewers for four hours it's a hundred
[22:52.840 --> 22:59.760]  thousand and that shows how saying Hollywood of the NFL is this royalty once that wears
[22:59.760 --> 23:07.200]  off it's over for them and it's all ready happening and Dave Chappelle knows that and
[23:07.200 --> 23:13.280]  they all know it so it's not about oh I have the biggest podcast I've had the biggest appearances
[23:13.280 --> 23:20.160]  for a long-form interview ever it's saying we're super popular yeah that's just the
[23:20.160 --> 23:24.640]  YouTube version 16.9 million views but he has over 50 other videos derivative of that
[23:24.640 --> 23:30.480]  just on the YouTube it's over 30 million views you count the others over 40 million so that's
[23:30.480 --> 23:37.160]  what I'm getting at is this freedom that we're promoting is super popular like oh we went
[23:37.160 --> 23:44.160]  out and sampled this ideology and people are eating it up well they better I mean freedom
[23:44.160 --> 23:51.120]  and justice and long life and what made America great rugged individualism men being men women
[23:51.120 --> 23:57.320]  being women people being strong and honorable and also being daring and aggressive and yes
[23:57.320 --> 24:00.960]  violent when you need to be that's part of being healthy I'm a very loving person I'm
[24:00.960 --> 24:06.000]  also extremely violent if I need to be because that's normal it's a normal attribute like
[24:06.000 --> 24:12.640]  a Swiss Army knife has many different tools on it but laying down and groveling has become
[24:12.640 --> 24:17.200]  what the West is about and a red carpet to every other ideology and every other system
[24:17.200 --> 24:27.880]  losing who we are in the process of groveling on our knees we are transformed into slaves
[24:27.880 --> 24:34.520]  and so I will go to your phone calls and I will play the Trump clip directly when we
[24:34.520 --> 24:40.160]  start the next segment and I'll cover all the other news but while we are distracted
[24:40.160 --> 24:44.160]  with the geopolitical crises that will thank God Trump's trying to de-escalate and hopefully
[24:44.160 --> 24:50.280]  Iran will take the cue and do that and then stop their Shiite expansion in the Middle
[24:50.280 --> 24:55.200]  East because Trump wants us to get out of there handed over to NATO and hopefully they'll
[24:55.200 --> 24:59.240]  stop killing each other and that's what he's saying you stop expanding Shiites you stop
[24:59.240 --> 25:05.080]  expanding Sunnis or we'll stay here and blow your ass off but we'll just kill your leaders
[25:05.080 --> 25:10.000]  no more troops dying in the blood in the sand no more random Muslims dying I don't hate
[25:10.000 --> 25:17.360]  Muslims I fear them I fear being conquered but you know who's even worse than the Muslim
[25:17.360 --> 25:21.400]  leadership has enslaved their own people and who are expanding worldwide not be 3 billion
[25:21.400 --> 25:32.840]  Muslims in 10 years or less 33 is the left and the left so evil and so anti-Christian
[25:32.840 --> 25:40.200]  it's merged with Islam for now the double team was left of the West when they're done
[25:40.200 --> 25:43.560]  they'll go after the Muslims as well but you know it is the Muslims standing up to the
[25:43.560 --> 25:47.440]  pedophile training in schools in Europe it is the Muslims that are doing that so there's
[25:47.440 --> 25:53.120]  a lot of people that as Muslims are not bad people but the ideology and the and the political
[25:53.120 --> 25:58.120]  Islam that's expansive is like cancer but you know what it's a lot better cancer than
[25:58.120 --> 26:05.320]  the left that's pure Satanism I'll say it Islam is better than occultic leftism which
[26:05.320 --> 26:10.400]  is just pure Satanism that's what I ran points that goes look the America is the great Satan
[26:10.400 --> 26:17.000]  well if you're watching Hollywood over there from their culture it is the great Satan but
[26:17.000 --> 26:25.120]  that's not America that pus pit that is Los Angeles and the pus pit that are the high
[26:25.120 --> 26:28.920]  rises in New York where the elites live not all of New York I like New York in a lot of
[26:28.920 --> 26:34.280]  ways the energy there is making me feel physically like I'm in hell but San Francisco has a hellish
[26:34.280 --> 26:39.960]  energy LA has a hellish energy I've been around Hillary Clinton she has a hellish energy Janet
[26:39.960 --> 26:47.880]  Reno has a hellish energy places have an energy I felt psychotically powerful at Stonehenge
[26:47.880 --> 26:56.880]  without it wasn't placebo I like all of a sudden walked up and the Park ranger was a professor
[26:56.880 --> 27:01.160]  and he goes yeah about 30% of people have had that effect when they cross that line
[27:01.160 --> 27:04.840]  right there it's electromagnetics coming out of the earth not so the ancients you know
[27:04.840 --> 27:09.600]  with like what's what is it about this place but so places have their own energy but individuals
[27:09.600 --> 27:16.320]  have their own energy and you know I could get seduced by the energy of Stonehenge but
[27:16.320 --> 27:21.600]  I wouldn't could never be seduced by the devil's energy that comes out of LA that's just vampiric
[27:21.600 --> 27:28.680]  and emptiness and just sorrow and dreams that are stolen I mean it'd be like offering
[27:28.680 --> 27:33.800]  me a billion dollars for my eyeballs no way well how about your soul wouldn't sell your
[27:33.800 --> 27:41.440]  eyeballs why would you sell your soul for something so empty I don't know I had to get
[27:41.440 --> 27:46.280]  away from Stonehenge because you know that feeling was wow but you know I don't want
[27:46.280 --> 27:55.600]  to I don't want to get away from this and it did make me feel violent that's why they
[27:55.600 --> 28:00.600]  took people there and killed the people he was a human sacrifice site so there's a lot
[28:00.600 --> 28:06.520]  going on in the world ladies and gentlemen and I'm not going to submit to the energy
[28:06.520 --> 28:14.280]  force of Islam because it's creepy it's oppressive when I'm around it I don't like it but the
[28:14.280 --> 28:19.920]  energy of Christ is pure and is clean and is good and is peaceful and is the quiet place
[28:19.920 --> 28:24.520]  the most high that Psalms talks about and that's the place we want to go so I'm glad
[28:24.520 --> 28:30.920]  that Trump's de-escalating but a clash between the West and Islam's been set up and we need
[28:30.920 --> 28:35.360]  to wall it off and hope that they can fix themselves and have a reformation but it's
[28:35.360 --> 28:39.800]  not going to be bringing in all the Muslims and us conforming to them I'm going to fight
[28:39.800 --> 28:43.920]  it you're going to fight it and Islam will not prevail against what's left of Christendom
[28:43.920 --> 28:46.400]  and we're about to see the biggest revival we've ever seen I believe but I'm going to
[28:46.400 --> 28:50.680]  stop preaching we're going to come back and take your calls bam bam bam play the trump

[29:50.760 --> 30:01.600]  heart and body extract 866-295-5305 or hbextract.com I keep my eye on the news all the time but
[30:01.600 --> 30:11.400]  I miss the fact that in late 2019 just about two weeks ago the CDC and the FDA approved
[30:11.400 --> 30:18.920]  live Ebola vaccine to be given inside the United States and it is an experimental vaccine
[30:18.920 --> 30:25.880]  it is live it's not even attenuated they've just genetically modified it so it's supposedly
[30:25.880 --> 30:32.200]  non-lethal same stuff they did with the Gardasil vaccine that's admittedly killed a name so
[30:32.200 --> 30:37.960]  many this is just crazy and the Congos have the biggest outbreaks of Ebola ever since
[30:37.960 --> 30:43.040]  they started giving the vaccine there in the last few years oh and of course open the borders
[30:43.040 --> 30:48.880]  up here and letting people in unfettered the Democrats distribute across the country you
[30:48.880 --> 30:55.760]  cannot make up the magnitude of this insanity and it is an attempted Ebola assault on America
[30:55.760 --> 31:01.040]  this is the new world order so what's the most important part let's say the bulldozers
[31:01.040 --> 31:05.720]  are running over the globalist the treads the wheels the engine the scoop on the front it's
[31:05.720 --> 31:11.960]  all very important but the fuel is paramount and that's my allegory turbo force is vitamins
[31:11.960 --> 31:16.760]  minerals amino acids that synergistically work with six different natural forms of healthy
[31:16.760 --> 31:21.360]  clean energy that lasts for 10 hours in the average metabolic system metabolism of a human
[31:21.360 --> 31:24.640]  some people get 15 hours out of it some people get about eight hours but people take this
[31:24.640 --> 31:28.320]  people taking sports people cannot believe it's the best they've ever had because it's
[31:28.320 --> 31:34.400]  not high nobody puts as much product into their pre workouts their post workouts you
[31:34.400 --> 31:37.760]  can call us whatever you want it's it's a it's a total solution all around the best

[31:50.400 --> 31:58.720]  body your mind it's a win-win 360 together info or store.com or triple a 253-3139 the
[31:58.720 --> 32:04.640]  globalists know that I will never willingly give up I've said it many times I will never
[32:04.640 --> 32:12.360]  give in I will never give up but I could give out and it's very very frustrating to see
[32:12.360 --> 32:18.480]  them committing all their crimes against humanity to see evil running rampant like this and
[32:18.480 --> 32:24.680]  to know that most Americans have already been silenced in cyberspace that most Americans
[32:24.680 --> 32:30.600]  have already been shadow banned by big tech and to know that most Americans feel powerless
[32:30.600 --> 32:36.600]  and don't realize how much power they have by spreading the word about news wars dot
[32:36.600 --> 32:41.960]  com info wars dot com and banned on video and that people are hungry for the truth now

[45:20.320 --> 45:25.960]  the good lord for the constitution i've been given but up until about eight nine years
[45:25.960 --> 45:32.480]  ago when i started taking x2 and the products in force life i i still got sick every couple
[45:32.480 --> 45:36.960]  years and you know i still get sore throats from allergies and pollen and things like

[46:07.560 --> 46:11.920]  in sale because a lot of the products have already sold out most the others are about
[46:11.920 --> 46:16.400]  to sell out but quite frankly i've been working on so many big stories that are breaking right
[46:16.400 --> 46:21.120]  now that i have not come up with new specials and we're already so close to selling out
[46:21.120 --> 46:25.120]  all these products that i'm just going to go ahead and keep the sale going for two more
[46:25.120 --> 46:30.600]  days and we're going to basically sell out of all of our major product lines it'll take
[46:30.600 --> 46:35.240]  weeks months for them all to come back in some come in a week some come in like three
[46:35.240 --> 46:39.760]  months a lot of stuff's coming back in next week so i've just decided because of the inventory
[46:39.760 --> 46:44.240]  issues all the rest of it because some of these were selling it losses are making people
[46:44.240 --> 46:47.480]  buy a lot of other stuff and we are making a profit so i'm going to just keep the sale
[46:47.480 --> 46:52.280]  going but only for forty eight hours maximum and then we've got to stop it info or store
[46:52.280 --> 47:01.480]  dot com year end now twenty twenty mega blowout sale info or store dot com biggest sales we're
[47:01.480 --> 47:17.600]  ever going to have you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:17.600 --> 47:23.120]  welcome back to the most censored rug catch the world not for the reasons they tell you
[47:23.120 --> 47:29.360]  but for reasons that have become very evident we are telling the truth we have dialed in
[47:29.360 --> 47:33.200]  what's really happening on the planet we believe in a pro human future we've been effective
[47:33.200 --> 47:38.880]  at rallying other humans to that cause we are the info or aren't we're going to a manual
[47:38.880 --> 47:45.320]  in norway i just want to make this point they fired a bunch of ballistic missiles from iran
[47:45.320 --> 47:52.280]  publicly into iraq they were aiming it at a u.s. military base the missile defense systems
[47:52.280 --> 47:59.000]  were able to shoot down missiles that rained down right outside the base but photos have
[47:59.000 --> 48:04.440]  been released that one of the missile parts did come in and destroy part of some buildings
[48:04.440 --> 48:09.360]  three buildings you can see and cause the fire that could have easily hit a barracks that
[48:09.360 --> 48:17.080]  could have easily killed dozens of not hundreds of people and so you know that if that would
[48:17.080 --> 48:21.040]  have killed people trump would have had to respond and then we could have been off the
[48:21.040 --> 48:28.240]  races so thank god not just for the people that didn't get killed the base but but but
[48:28.240 --> 48:33.000]  thank god for everybody that it didn't happen and i want to play this clip because last
[48:33.000 --> 48:38.240]  night i'm up here and i noticed we started reporting because it was on msnbc that oh i
[48:38.240 --> 48:45.200]  ran is saying 20 dead 30 dead 18 dead and i just said listen iran's going to say that
[48:45.200 --> 48:49.720]  for their own domestic population we're not hearing those reports and sure enough it turned
[48:49.720 --> 48:53.880]  out those were false reports not our reports we were just reporting what was being reported
[48:53.880 --> 48:58.040]  which is normal but but just saying we don't believe this and thank god it wasn't true
[48:58.040 --> 49:03.800]  let's play clip 12 msnbc amplified fake news that iranian attack had killed 30 us soldiers
[49:03.800 --> 49:09.360]  here it is we're just getting reports now that a second wave of rocket launch rocket
[49:09.360 --> 49:15.640]  attacks have been launched from iran the irgc was saying that ayatollah khamenei the supreme
[49:15.640 --> 49:22.280]  leader of this country was in the control center coordinating these attacks this is
[49:22.280 --> 49:28.920]  a this bit i am i'm not sure about that iran state media is claiming that 30 us soldiers
[49:28.920 --> 49:33.880]  have been killed in this attack and now this is not confirmed this is just coming from iranian
[49:33.880 --> 49:40.720]  media but we have just stepped over the precipice chris we have entered a very unpredictable time
[49:40.720 --> 49:46.760]  we have to see what the response is going to be from the united states but we did not
[49:46.760 --> 49:50.960]  step over the precipice thank god and hopefully iran pulls back we're gonna go to your calls
[49:50.960 --> 49:55.800]  right now for the next three four hours let's go to a manual in norway thank you so much
[49:55.800 --> 50:02.600]  for holding you're on the air thank you alex for taking my call i just want to say that
[50:02.600 --> 50:08.720]  uh i know that a lot of people know info wars is important to americans but it's also very
[50:08.720 --> 50:14.400]  important for people abroad we don't have any info wars in norway we we need you to continue
[50:14.400 --> 50:20.760]  to be on here and so for that reason i hear you plug the product and it's great and i understand
[50:20.760 --> 50:27.720]  why but i think it's time that we start tithing and a lot of us we are already tithing to
[50:27.720 --> 50:33.400]  different uh churches and some of us don't even have a church any longer because the
[50:33.400 --> 50:38.640]  church is too many of them they don't really address the real issues and that's why i call
[50:38.640 --> 50:44.560]  it sometimes unfortunately teddy bear religion where it's just a cozy place a social club
[50:44.560 --> 50:49.760]  and it's not really addressing the real issues and so for those who haven't been thinking
[50:49.760 --> 50:56.720]  of tithing to info wars i just want to say that christ came not to be a cozy bear not
[50:56.720 --> 51:02.280]  to be a teddy bear not to be so nice but he came to confront evil and that's what he did
[51:02.280 --> 51:07.960]  he healed people because he confronted evil he lifted up people because he confronted
[51:07.960 --> 51:13.800]  the ones that suppressed them he set people free because he confronted the evil that was
[51:13.800 --> 51:19.200]  holding them in chain and so i think it's time that we look at this as a church mission
[51:19.200 --> 51:25.960]  what info wars is doing is like a church mission a church is where people gather to find and
[51:25.960 --> 51:30.760]  to get revelations from god to pray and to get revelation and then you get a mission
[51:30.760 --> 51:37.200]  based on that and you go out and you ask and that is in my opinion what info wars is doing
[51:37.200 --> 51:43.400]  and i i really do believe it is important that we start tithing and also the one thing
[51:43.400 --> 51:49.400]  that i'm thinking that you could do to make it easier for us to tithe is to get on your
[51:49.400 --> 51:56.080]  website a recurring donation option because right now i can go in and i can donate but
[51:56.080 --> 52:01.240]  i will forget next month and then month after that and it's not because i don't care but
[52:01.240 --> 52:06.560]  you know life happens so if there's one thing i would recommend you to do i like it is to
[52:06.560 --> 52:11.640]  get the recurring donation function in there if if it's there already i haven't noticed
[52:11.640 --> 52:15.600]  it oh ma'am ma'am since you bring this up and i'm glad you bring it up if we got enough
[52:15.600 --> 52:20.080]  donations i would not even plug during the show and that that would be the way to do
[52:20.080 --> 52:26.000]  it because the churches aren't against abortion in most areas now the churches aren't saying
[52:26.000 --> 52:29.840]  go out and confront all the satanism in the schools go out and confront the pedophilia
[52:29.840 --> 52:34.880]  they're all hiding they're not saying don't take the microchip world governments here
[52:34.880 --> 52:38.400]  and the churches most of them are 501c3's and so they won't even say anything about
[52:38.400 --> 52:42.960]  what's happening and so that's what i've said local radio stations that carry this show
[52:42.960 --> 52:48.520]  or others like it people should support them donate to them because it is a tithe for the
[52:48.520 --> 52:53.960]  truth to get what's happening out to warn people and we're way more effective i'm not again
[52:53.960 --> 52:59.320]  tooting my horn at getting people to realize the spiritual battle by not all being hypocritical
[52:59.320 --> 53:03.960]  or all being stuff sued you know i'm the preacher and you're you're a sinner and i'm good and
[53:03.960 --> 53:08.520]  do what i say i'm just saying jesus is real the devil's real i've experienced it i've
[53:08.520 --> 53:11.640]  been out there on the front lines against these people they know they serve satan it's
[53:11.640 --> 53:16.440]  a real spiritual battle and the enemy is coming after me stronger than almost anybody else
[53:16.440 --> 53:20.900]  because they know we're actually waking people up so yes ma'am we updated the shopping cart
[53:20.900 --> 53:26.320]  about three months ago with the latest best greatest software and security but for whatever
[53:26.320 --> 53:30.960]  reason i've got a special company trying to do it right now you you the people are not
[53:30.960 --> 53:34.760]  able to do a custom amount it's like ten dollars twenty dollars fifty dollars hundred dollars
[53:34.760 --> 53:38.760]  we're gonna have that i'm told by next week i was having meetings about that yesterday
[53:38.760 --> 53:43.280]  and we're gonna have the recurring thing now we have auto ship it's like a recurring thing
[53:43.280 --> 53:47.600]  but i know it's hard to get our products into europe sometimes and issues happen so thank
[53:47.600 --> 53:52.680]  you so much you're right the recurring donation is the way to do it and again we're not a big
[53:52.680 --> 53:57.680]  giant company but i'm on it i don't know why we can't do it i apologize believe me we've
[53:57.680 --> 54:01.200]  got all this multimedia we've got to do our own streaming we got to do our own video i'm
[54:01.200 --> 54:05.600]  not complaining it's just we have a lot of stuff we have to do to keep this on air and
[54:05.600 --> 54:10.320]  then sometimes the simplest things like that i i just don't know why we can't do it but
[54:10.320 --> 54:15.760]  maybe we'll create a whole new site because if that software doesn't fit with our software
[54:15.760 --> 54:19.440]  uh instead of trying to always make this software work to do that we should probably just create
[54:19.440 --> 54:23.640]  maybe a donation site itself i've learned like we'll kind of hit a problem bang our head
[54:23.640 --> 54:29.000]  into it for years instead of just go around that and i think there's a lot of innovations
[54:29.000 --> 54:32.000]  out there so we're really good at information we're really good at gas we're really good
[54:32.000 --> 54:35.880]  at breaking things we're really good at going out and making high quality products but when
[54:35.880 --> 54:39.640]  it comes to to actually making it easy for you to donate we've really dropped the ball
[54:39.640 --> 54:44.600]  big time and i and i totally agree with you immanuel and and it's critical for us to not
[54:44.600 --> 54:47.880]  beat people over the head to buy products when a lot of people just want to give but then
[54:47.880 --> 54:54.600]  we don't make it as easy as we should so thank you and you're absolutely right thank you all
[54:54.600 --> 54:59.080]  right thank you god bless okay we always get slow going to the calls and that was one caller
[54:59.080 --> 55:03.720]  now i'm gonna i'm gonna speed up okay uh let's go to patrick and maryland you're on the air
[55:03.720 --> 55:12.520]  go ahead hey alex patrick god bless you thank you for taking my call a long time listener
[55:12.520 --> 55:18.520]  first time caller i'm an avid supporter of your products too i uh actually about 10 years
[55:18.520 --> 55:23.800]  ago suffered from Lyme disease got very very sick couldn't work for a whole year and then
[55:23.800 --> 55:28.200]  i started listening to you and i started learning about your products and i was just amazed at
[55:28.200 --> 55:34.040]  how sophisticated all your products are i i think i take probably 80 percent of what
[55:34.040 --> 55:39.400]  your supplements and products are i even have the elixir breeze in my in my bedroom i love
[55:39.400 --> 55:44.120]  it it's incredible well that's why it's a super supporters like you that buy the products that
[55:44.120 --> 55:47.880]  call in you're you're the reason this is happening all over the world you know for passive people
[55:47.880 --> 55:52.440]  that are really waking up let me just say something about living defense that's been sold out for
[55:53.960 --> 55:59.240]  10 weeks it's a best seller and it's not going to begin probably for a month still because there's
[55:59.240 --> 56:05.160]  one wildcrafted organic part of it that the big company we use we're not compromising on
[56:05.160 --> 56:11.320]  to get that and so sometimes we have to reformulate a product and change the name just because we
[56:11.320 --> 56:16.520]  can no longer get an ingredient at that highest quality level so that that's that's why stuff
[56:16.520 --> 56:21.320]  sold out sometimes it isn't in right away it's because it literally takes time to do that so
[56:21.320 --> 56:26.280]  thank you it's fantastic uh i look forward to getting that product again it was very helpful so
[56:26.280 --> 56:32.600]  a z shield and i noticed too here it is 2020 that we had a lot i live outside of washington dc
[56:32.600 --> 56:37.160]  we had a lot of chemtrails a lot of spring around christmas time just before the beginning of the
[56:37.160 --> 56:44.520]  year now january first no chemtrails no spring and the z shield is fantastic for warding up
[56:44.520 --> 56:49.880]  against the heavy metal it's absolutely a great key later and he talks about yeah well let's talk
[56:49.880 --> 56:55.000]  about trump he seemed a little nervous in his speech today maybe a little off balance you know
[56:55.000 --> 57:00.200]  because of this the stress and the tension um but let's really talk about what's going on with
[57:00.200 --> 57:05.720]  with the whole scenario and what the media you're the only one addresses this but the media doesn't
[57:05.720 --> 57:11.800]  address the fact that we're not at war with iran we're not a war with iranian people we're at war
[57:11.800 --> 57:19.640]  with the deep state and the criminals we're we are that the swamp is worldwide and he is draining
[57:19.640 --> 57:25.800]  that swamp all over and he has to go out there and take care of the things that need to be dealt with
[57:25.800 --> 57:31.720]  and that's what he's doing when the patriots are in yeah it's it's time to celebrate and thank
[57:31.720 --> 57:37.160]  jesus christ and the lord god that we are in control the god is in oh there is no doubt that
[57:37.160 --> 57:41.160]  trump is draining the swamp uh on multiple levels and they are panicking they don't know what to do
[57:41.160 --> 57:45.640]  patrick god bless you thank you all right hour number two in two minutes i'm going right to your
[57:45.640 --> 57:53.240]  calls if you understand why the globalist why the servants of satan hate info wars it's because
[57:53.240 --> 58:01.000]  we're awake we're alive we're passionate and we're not giving up that's why it's critical for those
[58:01.000 --> 58:06.680]  of us that are aware of the new world order's plans to not get down when they attack us and they
[58:06.680 --> 58:13.480]  persecute us and they lie about us that's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags
[58:13.480 --> 58:18.200]  the globalists have literally sold their souls to the dark side and they do what they do because
[58:18.200 --> 58:23.560]  they're slaves because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and
[58:23.560 --> 58:30.280]  destroy the innocent it is up to us who are awake not the sheep and not the wolves but the sheep
[58:30.280 --> 58:38.200]  dogs to stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants they fear the fact that we are awake they fear
[58:38.200 --> 58:45.480]  the fact that we are alive they fear the fact that we love god and that's all we ever have to know
[58:45.480 --> 58:54.040]  is that god is in charge you deserve a deep restful sleep with knockout by info wars life

[1:00:07.080 --> 1:00:14.920]  war all right we are now into hour number two broadcasting worldwide i want to go to javon
[1:00:14.920 --> 1:00:19.720]  i want to go to liberal i want to go to patreon i want to go to john scottie everybody right now
[1:00:22.520 --> 1:00:28.360]  let's go ahead and go to jk in washington dc says the left and right can unify against the elite
[1:00:28.360 --> 1:00:34.520]  that's really what i'd like to do and i know i can be divisive when i attack the left um
[1:00:34.520 --> 1:00:41.400]  because people think of the left as liberals but the left is nothing to do with liberals but
[1:00:41.400 --> 1:00:45.400]  i know we identify liberals as the left today because the left has been so successful at
[1:00:45.400 --> 1:00:51.800]  taking over liberals i think we unify the the liberals with the right by using those limited
[1:00:51.800 --> 1:00:56.280]  terms that have limited uh debt to them but but still people know those words they know what that
[1:00:56.280 --> 1:01:02.280]  means by exposing the left and getting liberals to reject the left the left is anti-free speech
[1:01:02.280 --> 1:01:07.160]  the left is authoritarian the left is openly evil and they have been very successful in
[1:01:07.160 --> 1:01:15.240]  destroying classical liberal values uh that are the jewel in the crown of western civilization
[1:01:15.240 --> 1:01:21.880]  go ahead jk yes alex um first i want to talk about uh the products well first of all i heard
[1:01:21.880 --> 1:01:27.400]  you on coast to coast i think 20 years ago and i've been following since probably 2010 and
[1:01:27.400 --> 1:01:34.680]  been buying products and send but the oxy powder is uh fantastic that's saved me many times without
[1:01:34.680 --> 1:01:40.040]  going into details but uh i have an order on the way uh so i talked to you three weeks ago i had
[1:01:40.040 --> 1:01:46.040]  one for christmas and the people said that they're working so well i i got more and i wanted to say
[1:01:46.040 --> 1:01:50.920]  on that real quickly i said to you before and you like the idea it works for liberals and
[1:01:50.920 --> 1:01:56.360]  conservatives and people on the left and on the right because your products are neutral they're
[1:01:56.360 --> 1:02:01.640]  you know iodine's made by god and that works for everybody just thought that might be an interesting
[1:02:02.840 --> 1:02:07.960]  advertising campaign no that's a good pitch that's a good pitch i like are you suffering from zombie
[1:02:07.960 --> 1:02:14.040]  like leftist craze behavior have you have you rejected classical liberal ideas uh that you
[1:02:14.040 --> 1:02:19.320]  supposedly support well perhaps you are deficient like three billion people in iodine causing a
[1:02:19.320 --> 1:02:25.400]  mental deficiency that's a great idea and you can also throw in the god part just a little bit
[1:02:25.400 --> 1:02:30.200]  because i know the lefties wouldn't like that but how it's made by god iodine all these different
[1:02:30.200 --> 1:02:34.440]  products you are the natural which is the opposite of the pharmaceutical well they're not offended
[1:02:34.440 --> 1:02:41.880]  if you say mother nature but i mean look there you go well i'm living in that world i'm here in
[1:02:41.880 --> 1:02:47.080]  the belly of the beast uh born here raised here i talked to you before i grew up in a
[1:02:47.080 --> 1:02:55.000]  cia neighborhood and um i'm just uh i have to be careful because of where i am but it ties
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:03:01.720]  in exactly with what i want to talk about this i believe is an opportunity to continue the momentum
[1:03:01.720 --> 1:03:08.600]  with epstein because i'm here in dc i'm a retired music teacher i'm now a chauffeur i actually drove
[1:03:08.600 --> 1:03:15.080]  joe rogan gave me a great tip um so i interact with all types of people but more on the left side
[1:03:15.640 --> 1:03:21.400]  and all of them didn't believe about epstein the left or the right and then the mess that that um
[1:03:21.400 --> 1:03:26.840]  whatever that state was it said mess i'm on it the left and the right left about that one ricky
[1:03:26.840 --> 1:03:32.040]  gervais uh however you say his last name and then you just mentioned about dav chipell who's from
[1:03:32.040 --> 1:03:38.360]  dc by the way grew up right near where i grew up um and he actually worked at he was an usher at
[1:03:38.360 --> 1:03:43.960]  ford's theater where link was assassinated and he and pete seager used to come to his house he's
[1:03:43.960 --> 1:03:48.840]  got a great story his parents are very politically active i think more on the left but you can tell
[1:03:48.840 --> 1:03:54.280]  why he's a world you know he's awake on how things work i think this is such an opportunity once again
[1:03:54.280 --> 1:04:00.200]  where i live i have to be i move in the circles of the left more on the left than the right
[1:04:00.920 --> 1:04:07.400]  but looking for common ground and i really think that the classical liberals and the everyday people
[1:04:07.400 --> 1:04:11.320]  are awakening whether on the left or the right because there's a lot of good people on the left
[1:04:11.320 --> 1:04:16.520]  i totally agree with you and i think 2020 should be the year of people reconciling they're gonna
[1:04:16.520 --> 1:04:21.960]  try to make it vulcanization but reconciling and trying to come together and a lot of liberals
[1:04:21.960 --> 1:04:26.520]  can be woken up the the the piranha like left is meant to be violent and polarizing to keep
[1:04:26.520 --> 1:04:30.840]  that from happening by the way i can tell you really got drove or you really drove joe rogan
[1:04:30.840 --> 1:04:35.480]  because that he is the biggest tipper i've ever seen carries a huge big fat wall and a cash don't
[1:04:35.480 --> 1:04:41.320]  want to get him mugged but he's pretty tough and i mean that guy he gives big tips doesn't he uh huge
[1:04:41.320 --> 1:04:45.960]  it when i don't want to say because then they'll be pressured up for him to beat that but the biggest
[1:04:45.960 --> 1:04:53.000]  tip i got and once again being in dc and driving all types of people i get to hear from them and
[1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:57.560]  this is definitely an opportunity that's crazy he routinely tips 200 bucks i would thank you for
[1:04:57.560 --> 1:05:03.000]  everything you've done for the info war but i know you're like me you don't want my thanks you want
[1:05:03.000 --> 1:05:07.480]  victory over the globalist and these devil worship and child molesters and you want them off your back
[1:05:07.480 --> 1:05:12.200]  and off your children's back and you know what i'm the same way and that's why we're on the same damn
[1:05:12.200 --> 1:05:18.520]  team and it's why info wars has been delivering time and time again when it's clutch time to
[1:05:19.640 --> 1:05:23.880]  focus the people on taking action against the globalist because i'm committed to a future
[1:05:24.760 --> 1:05:30.760]  for humanity and i know you are as well so thank you in 2019 for standing with us because you are
[1:05:30.760 --> 1:05:36.040]  the info war and i want to thank you for committing to stand with us in 2020 however you can for the
[1:05:36.040 --> 1:05:40.520]  bottom of my heart for my family and from the great crew at info wars i want to thank you all
[1:05:40.520 --> 1:05:46.600]  because you are the info war and you know that's not just words that's reality you have made history
[1:05:47.160 --> 1:05:55.560]  we have made history together info wars dot com only has power because of you and i suggest you use it
[1:05:55.560 --> 1:06:13.960]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance you're listening to alex
[1:06:13.960 --> 1:06:31.000]  jones is this some conspiracy crucified for no sins we're taking your phone calls on this live
[1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:47.560]  january 8 2020 worldwide transmission while we're busy focused on what trump did last thursday
[1:06:48.600 --> 1:06:53.240]  now the iranians responded thank god the missiles didn't kill anybody but parts of them hit the base
[1:06:53.240 --> 1:06:59.880]  we have exclusive photos on info wars dot com but while we're busy focused on that
[1:07:02.440 --> 1:07:05.960]  they're just coming out and saying yeah all your appliances communicate with each other
[1:07:05.960 --> 1:07:12.120]  whether you like it or not everything's being seamlessly integrated into the incredibly promiscuous
[1:07:12.120 --> 1:07:24.200]  cloud and i have to spend a lot of my time turning stuff off in my car turning stuff off in my phone
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:29.960]  systems jumping into other systems controlling other systems
[1:07:31.880 --> 1:07:37.720]  phones interfering with other smart devices and then you don't even want smart devices
[1:07:37.720 --> 1:07:41.160]  because they're really just spy devices because they're always malfunctioning and
[1:07:41.160 --> 1:07:47.000]  they're spying on you and it's hard to find stuff that isn't got tech integrated into it
[1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:52.280]  because that's the whole business plan is to have those devices spy on you as a whole new
[1:07:52.280 --> 1:07:58.760]  company business line from everything from samsung to apple to
[1:08:01.960 --> 1:08:09.480]  mayflower or maytag and that's what's going on and they admitted the specs to it they admitted
[1:08:09.480 --> 1:08:16.200]  the whole plan and all these governments are racing to defeat each other to have the biggest
[1:08:16.200 --> 1:08:22.920]  baddest ai to take control of it it's just a decided evolution since the 1960s of the internet
[1:08:22.920 --> 1:08:29.960]  to take over civilization and to take over human activity it is the slow destruction of a human
[1:08:29.960 --> 1:08:36.040]  future and all of it makes us dumb it it fries us it makes us alone it makes us obsolete
[1:08:36.040 --> 1:08:43.160]  the internet of things is creating 1984's national camera surveillance network yeah
[1:08:43.160 --> 1:08:49.480]  that's Forbes it's all light years down a black hole worse than that it is the surveillance
[1:08:49.480 --> 1:08:56.280]  apocalypse because people go what do i have to hide it it's not that it's that the data's all
[1:08:56.280 --> 1:09:01.640]  sold and then used to game economies game corporations game stock markets where everything
[1:09:01.640 --> 1:09:06.520]  becomes vertically integrated and there's no competition i'll go to your calls which is a
[1:09:06.520 --> 1:09:12.760]  case in point i remember 15 years ago i'm not an it guy but i'm always learning about the
[1:09:12.760 --> 1:09:20.040]  scams that are going on and and and how that operates and i remember having um some of the
[1:09:20.680 --> 1:09:25.080]  individuals i was uh talking to that were engineers researching this they said listen
[1:09:25.080 --> 1:09:33.320]  clear your cookies when you're on a travel site or a hotel site or on things like amazon
[1:09:34.360 --> 1:09:39.400]  because the word is they know your profile and they'll charge you different prices
[1:09:40.840 --> 1:09:44.600]  depending on what they think you'll pay so they think you're rich or they think you're
[1:09:44.600 --> 1:09:48.920]  poor they think you splurge they think you don't splurge they will charge you more or less
[1:09:49.800 --> 1:09:54.200]  and i've been on hotel websites and i've been on travel sites and you see the higher number
[1:09:54.200 --> 1:10:00.360]  you clear the cookies and it's a lot less and years later it came out in the news that a
[1:10:00.360 --> 1:10:05.960]  lot of big travel sites and hotels were doing that and rental car places now that's one example
[1:10:07.240 --> 1:10:11.240]  so i know our audience knows this but for younger people and others that that have been growing up
[1:10:11.240 --> 1:10:14.440]  with all this and just think it's part of the background and it's just something they accept
[1:10:14.440 --> 1:10:19.640]  and they just adapt to that environment you don't want to adapt to being a slave we need to really
[1:10:19.640 --> 1:10:23.560]  get a handle on this and now cause a big debate about that and make the new economy about getting
[1:10:23.560 --> 1:10:28.520]  away from this surveillance economy and innovating a new economy that has technology but not technology
[1:10:28.520 --> 1:10:34.040]  that kills us or is invasive and going back to low tech that's analog that in many ways is higher
[1:10:34.040 --> 1:10:38.840]  quality and it's more reliable i've been saying for years i believe that'll be the next big real
[1:10:38.840 --> 1:10:44.600]  organic move is away from all this and then the balance of that and you know the futuristic
[1:10:44.600 --> 1:10:51.720]  integration of different ideas of how we could do that instead it's all one big lock step situation
[1:10:51.720 --> 1:10:58.360]  but but here's the easiest parallel or or parable or example when you have a door on your house or
[1:10:58.360 --> 1:11:03.480]  screens on your windows it's not because you're killing people inside and you're hiding something
[1:11:06.120 --> 1:11:10.840]  you close your door because it's a security feature going back forever where you know that
[1:11:10.840 --> 1:11:15.160]  that the cave is secure and you have a higher level of security that that's closed because there's
[1:11:15.160 --> 1:11:22.920]  dangerous things in the world you pull the shades because maybe the sun's in your eyes or maybe
[1:11:24.120 --> 1:11:31.000]  you don't want people looking in while you do something privately because knowledge is important
[1:11:33.560 --> 1:11:38.600]  if you're planning to build something new and and you've got a competitor that lives right next
[1:11:38.600 --> 1:11:42.040]  door to you you don't want them to know that information so just giving everything up is
[1:11:42.040 --> 1:11:50.200]  really stupid and it's the creed that leads to total slavery and we need to really talk about
[1:11:50.200 --> 1:11:55.160]  this because now everything we exposed when it was in its embryonic development phases and then
[1:11:55.160 --> 1:12:01.560]  beta phases and now rollout phases is all being admitted and the media now is admitting it and
[1:12:01.560 --> 1:12:05.160]  saying it's bad or they're saying how great it is we should just capitulate to it
[1:12:05.160 --> 1:12:13.880]  and so we better get involved in that debate now and say no to all this because it's out
[1:12:13.880 --> 1:12:19.000]  of control so in 2020 we're going to be burrowing into that massively people used to say oh i'll
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:24.280]  just put where i live on facebook or wherever and then you'd show your address you'd you'd you'd
[1:12:24.280 --> 1:12:27.960]  geolocate where you are on the photos you're taking not even thinking to turn that off
[1:12:27.960 --> 1:12:33.720]  why the hell that even be on there and then people rob you when you're out of town because
[1:12:33.720 --> 1:12:38.280]  they got everything they need to know about you because you're putting it all on facebook
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:45.480]  now i know our audience doesn't do that but having nothing to hide has nothing to do with it
[1:12:50.840 --> 1:12:55.480]  it's like saying why am i wearing clothing well because clothing protects my skin
[1:12:56.040 --> 1:13:01.400]  and it also becomes part of human style i'm not a bad person that i'm covering up my body
[1:13:01.400 --> 1:13:09.080]  it's a choice i made and if i worked outside i'd end up dying a cancer if i didn't cover up my body
[1:13:11.080 --> 1:13:19.560]  so doors windows code keys box on doors those are there for a reason
[1:13:21.560 --> 1:13:25.000]  and i know i'm stating very simple things here people are like why are you talking to us like
[1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:29.880]  we're five years old i know you know that but the general public that's been lulled into this
[1:13:29.880 --> 1:13:35.640]  incrementally is in big trouble okay let's take a call right now let's go to scottie and i'm glad
[1:13:35.640 --> 1:13:40.280]  he called in about this because i was going to get to this in the third hour gun confiscation
[1:13:40.280 --> 1:13:46.760]  virginia dims entered his gun control and ammunition bands and bills to ban guns and
[1:13:46.760 --> 1:13:54.120]  ban simi autos and ban shooting ranges uh that's mainstream news they are coming for the guns
[1:13:54.120 --> 1:14:01.080]  what do you think about that scottie thank you it's a true honor to speak to you in your audience
[1:14:01.800 --> 1:14:08.040]  this morning uh i listened to npr knows you know i'm a truck driver commercial driver and
[1:14:08.760 --> 1:14:15.960]  governor Ralph northam i am a resident of virginia and he is drawing back on some of his uh ideals
[1:14:15.960 --> 1:14:23.960]  and topics he is publicly stating that that some of these things was out of control and it got
[1:14:23.960 --> 1:14:30.920]  blown out of proportion is his you know why he's supposedly come out with this new press release
[1:14:31.800 --> 1:14:38.520]  in the state of virginia this morning on npr news they played him having this press release
[1:14:38.520 --> 1:14:43.320]  which i know and this is what i'm telling my friends and my buddies we have to be aware we can't
[1:14:43.320 --> 1:14:48.760]  let our guards down i actually live in tassel county which is a county in virginia we were the

[1:15:09.720 --> 1:15:15.080]  militias are constitutional it's what we need for civil defense and when governments become tyrannical
[1:15:15.080 --> 1:15:19.640]  and destructive of our bill of rights it's our right and duty to form a defense against that
[1:15:19.640 --> 1:15:24.840]  that's how 1776 started there's nothing more america than what you're doing but how are you
[1:15:24.840 --> 1:15:29.560]  going to guard against infiltration every group has to have a code of ethics and has to watch out

[1:18:13.800 --> 1:18:18.920]  right now that i have not come up with new specials and we're already so close to selling out all

[1:18:42.760 --> 1:18:47.720]  and we are making a profit so i'm going to just keep the sale going but only for 48 hours maximum

[1:19:48.280 --> 1:19:54.040]  strip away the enamel so we're really proud of it it funds the operation infowarstore.com
[1:19:54.040 --> 1:19:55.880]  and that's why we're still on air thanks to you
[1:19:55.880 --> 1:20:11.800]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:20:14.520 --> 1:20:21.480]  i have really tried not to overhype how serious virginia is but it's not just me it's
[1:20:21.480 --> 1:20:29.400]  the nra it's mainline conservatives that clearly see the democrats are trying to stir up a fight
[1:20:29.960 --> 1:20:34.040]  they say bring in the un and take guns they say bring in the military and take the guns these are
[1:20:34.040 --> 1:20:39.720]  state reps when the governor's not in blackface or in kkk outfits are talking about keeping babies
[1:20:39.720 --> 1:20:44.520]  comfortable before they harvest their organs that's after their babies are born when this
[1:20:44.520 --> 1:20:49.880]  compromised monster isn't out doing that they're promising to register and then confiscate guns
[1:20:49.880 --> 1:20:54.440]  and then to arrest anybody that doesn't do it and so you've had first it was the majority of the
[1:20:54.440 --> 1:21:00.440]  counties last time i checked it's only a couple counties that are in northern virginia that are
[1:21:00.440 --> 1:21:06.120]  democrats but almost all the other counties over 90 percent are saying we're not turned the guns in
[1:21:06.120 --> 1:21:10.200]  and the sheriffs have had press conferences and they've had hundreds and sometimes thousands of
[1:21:10.200 --> 1:21:15.720]  people at the county commission meetings all agreeing that's local government saying we don't
[1:21:15.720 --> 1:21:23.400]  agree to the king of england taking our guns just because the king of virginia king northam
[1:21:24.760 --> 1:21:27.560]  is controlled by the globalist doesn't mean we're going to turn them in and and and so the
[1:21:27.560 --> 1:21:35.640]  democrats are spoiling to start a fight well this isn't going to be like eisenhower sitting
[1:21:35.640 --> 1:21:39.000]  in the army so little black girls can go to school everybody agreed with that pretty much
[1:21:39.000 --> 1:21:46.120]  this is the feds coming in to take guns and it's not gonna work might have worked to come take
[1:21:46.120 --> 1:21:50.200]  confederate statues and try to trick the right into some type of fight there's histories being
[1:21:50.200 --> 1:21:56.680]  taken down but this is the guns and this is unifying people and you know i said it and trump
[1:21:56.680 --> 1:22:00.680]  said it a few years ago when they said that the confederate flag is this evil racist symbol which
[1:22:00.680 --> 1:22:06.440]  it's not you know the history that the american flag would be next and now they want to take that
[1:22:06.440 --> 1:22:12.040]  and they even want to get rid of the betsy ross flag saying it's bad when she was a famous abolitionist
[1:22:13.000 --> 1:22:17.960]  but the abbas democrat constituent doesn't know what an abolitionist is abolitionist movement
[1:22:17.960 --> 1:22:24.120]  started in england and within a hundred years of it slavery was banned in the western world
[1:22:24.120 --> 1:22:30.840]  and the british fought over 11 wars against people that were still selling slaves white people
[1:22:30.840 --> 1:22:37.640]  ended slavery in the modern world it still goes on in africa in five or six countries
[1:22:37.640 --> 1:22:43.160]  most of those muslim and i'm not putting africans or muslims down it's it's barbarous it's backwards
[1:22:43.160 --> 1:22:47.800]  but you don't then say to every person in africa because a few countries still have slavery you're
[1:22:47.800 --> 1:22:53.240]  all guilty because black people have slaves and so all black people are evil it's like saying white
[1:22:53.240 --> 1:22:58.360]  people once did something wrong so i mean that's crazy because hitler did something wrong i'm part
[1:22:58.360 --> 1:23:06.040]  german i'm i'm to blame but they project this guilt and they're planning something big and they've
[1:23:06.040 --> 1:23:11.560]  said they are and i saw soros fund the leftist groups to come attack the right wing groups and i
[1:23:11.560 --> 1:23:16.360]  saw the media demonize just journalists in general that covered it and i said wow soros is trying to
[1:23:16.360 --> 1:23:23.000]  kick off a revolution i didn't say the individual democrats that were out there killed that lady
[1:23:23.000 --> 1:23:28.840]  that got hit by the car had the heart attack but they're suing me um the georgetown university is
[1:23:28.840 --> 1:23:38.120]  financing a lawsuit saying i said some individual killed a woman who was taking photos i didn't
[1:23:38.120 --> 1:23:43.560]  say that but it doesn't matter because that's what the media and georgetown do ganging up on us we've
[1:23:43.560 --> 1:23:48.440]  been fighting for two years and they are really really upset and we're supposedly gonna see some
[1:23:48.440 --> 1:23:55.000]  big movement on that monday um and and let's just say this the system knows they can't shut us down
[1:23:55.000 --> 1:24:00.280]  with these lawsuits because they're based in in in baloney showed they want the process to shut us
[1:24:00.280 --> 1:24:05.080]  down by claiming we're not complying with the process which we are totally we have nothing to
[1:24:05.080 --> 1:24:11.000]  hide about virginia or sandy hook what we said on air is what we said but then in the in the process
[1:24:11.000 --> 1:24:17.480]  of discovery saying we're criminally covering stuff up and then oh child porn's found embedded on
[1:24:17.480 --> 1:24:28.440]  emails we never opened sent to us about sandy hook since the suit started hidden code that of course
[1:24:28.440 --> 1:24:35.080]  they got and found and put on the news that alex jones sent child porn to the sandy hook families
[1:24:35.080 --> 1:24:39.640]  that's the type of stuff going on and i've been talking to law enforcement i've been talking to
[1:24:39.640 --> 1:24:43.880]  lawyers and others and there's no doubt that democrat operatives out there are trying to put
[1:24:43.880 --> 1:24:48.600]  a federal case on me to put me in jail like roger stout and i'm not scared they're the crooks
[1:24:48.600 --> 1:24:52.520]  they're the bad people whatever they try to cook up i believe god is going to defeat no
[1:24:52.520 --> 1:24:57.240]  weapon formed against us so prosper but if they've already tried to plant child porn on us folks i
[1:24:57.240 --> 1:25:02.120]  mean i got a call from dc yesterday that's where this is all being run out of and they said yeah
[1:25:02.120 --> 1:25:06.760]  this is the word they're gonna try some big stuff next week out of the fake virginia case so
[1:25:06.760 --> 1:25:12.200]  just be ready for some really nasty stuff next week because they are pissed that we exist
[1:25:12.200 --> 1:25:19.000]  very pissed and soros of course is funding the whole damn thing but he's losing it and the
[1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:23.960]  globalists are in trouble and just praise god okay i'm ranting scotty in virginia you raised this
[1:25:25.320 --> 1:25:31.560]  here's the press release virginia dem's introduced new gun and ammo bands as session began semi auto
[1:25:31.560 --> 1:25:39.720]  bands ammo bands classics felony to purchase possess transfer any of it shut down the gun

[1:26:26.680 --> 1:26:30.040]  and they're just coming after everything i should probably just read this whole damn thing on air
[1:26:30.040 --> 1:26:33.800]  this should have been our top story today actually i'm just glad world war three hadn't kicked off
[1:26:33.800 --> 1:26:39.640]  uh so yeah i'm going up there peacefully because they're gonna say i'm there as a terrorist or

[1:26:51.960 --> 1:26:56.680]  wars basically start in virginia and it looks like one may start again and i pray to jesus that
[1:26:56.680 --> 1:27:00.440]  doesn't happen scottie what's your other points about what the governor's out announcing and

[1:27:18.120 --> 1:27:25.240]  cult i think the governor realizes he's struck a nerve and now he's trying to back down uh

[1:27:31.160 --> 1:27:36.200]  retired coal miner worked he's hiding off all his life and now he has to move leave the state

[1:30:00.440 --> 1:30:07.480]  hate info wars it's because we're awake we're alive we're passionate and we're not giving
[1:30:07.480 --> 1:30:12.680]  up that's why it's critical for those of us that are aware of the new world order's plans
[1:30:13.240 --> 1:30:17.320]  to not get down when they attack us and they persecute us and they lie about us
[1:30:17.880 --> 1:30:23.320]  that's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags the globalists have
[1:30:23.320 --> 1:30:28.360]  literally sold their soul to the dark side and they do what they do because they're slaves
[1:30:28.360 --> 1:30:33.880]  because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent
[1:30:33.880 --> 1:30:41.320]  it is up to us who are awake not the sheep and not the wolves but the sheet dogs to stand firm
[1:30:41.320 --> 1:30:47.800]  and resist these wicked tyrants they fear the fact that we are awake they fear the fact that
[1:30:47.800 --> 1:30:55.080]  we are alive they fear the fact that we love god and that's all we ever have to know is that god
[1:30:55.080 --> 1:31:00.600]  is in charge info wars life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine introducing
[1:31:00.600 --> 1:31:06.360]  pollen block we have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress
[1:31:06.360 --> 1:31:12.680]  symptoms including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways eye comfort and respiratory
[1:31:12.680 --> 1:31:19.080]  function in the 1960s researchers in france noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[1:31:19.080 --> 1:31:24.760]  experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses they began studying this effect in
[1:31:24.760 --> 1:31:30.600]  published trials and decades later we now have the fruit of this research a fast-acting chewable
[1:31:30.600 --> 1:31:36.600]  tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms pollen block is natural and effective
[1:31:36.600 --> 1:31:41.480]  it is not an antihistamine in fact current research has found that it actually acts by
[1:31:41.480 --> 1:31:46.600]  blocking the activity of triptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory
[1:31:46.600 --> 1:31:52.920]  responses in the body go outside and enjoy the air you breathe head to info wars life.com

[1:32:09.320 --> 1:32:15.160]  at ups and make a long story short i used to have a problem with adderall i do have adhd but you
[1:32:15.160 --> 1:32:19.480]  know i was taking adderall for its energy boosting properties you know i kind of got a little out of
[1:32:19.480 --> 1:32:23.960]  hand and you know i listen you religiously in my truck every day so i tried your turbo force and
[1:32:23.960 --> 1:32:28.600]  really it's a cliche this product changed my life but turbo force really changed my life

[1:32:55.640 --> 1:33:19.480]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:33:26.600 --> 1:33:34.760]  well i get wanting to have good news and and we're looking but we're not finding it
[1:33:35.640 --> 1:33:42.040]  pauler was saying earlier that the governor of virginia was backing down on uh wanting gun
[1:33:42.040 --> 1:33:46.680]  confiscation and ammo confiscation because he went on npr and said oh we we just want
[1:33:48.120 --> 1:33:53.000]  background checks well when they say that they mean registration we're looking for that but
[1:33:53.000 --> 1:33:59.800]  they've introduced the bills then look they're backing down to me so we'll uh get to the bottom
[1:33:59.800 --> 1:34:03.160]  of that i'm going to put a compilation together because we did this a few months ago but we can't
[1:34:03.160 --> 1:34:09.480]  just forget about it i'm going to i'll do it myself i need to uh i'm going to get the democrat
[1:34:09.480 --> 1:34:15.000]  debates where they all agreed with beto at two different debates that yeah we should take all
[1:34:15.000 --> 1:34:21.560]  the semiados and then it all became oh beto just said that that's not what we really want to do
[1:34:21.560 --> 1:34:25.640]  no that's the new york times that's the boston globe repeal the second amendment
[1:34:25.640 --> 1:34:29.480]  take the guns out of their dead hands mr and mrs america turn them all in
[1:34:29.480 --> 1:34:33.080]  that's been their goal and every city democrats control that's what they've done
[1:34:34.760 --> 1:34:39.480]  and finally they come out on the big stage and admit it all and then we just kind of
[1:34:39.480 --> 1:34:43.880]  let it move on to the next thing and now they're back to denying oh we don't want your guns
[1:34:43.880 --> 1:34:52.360]  guns everywhere they get control they take the guns and the crime rate explodes just like
[1:34:52.360 --> 1:34:59.160]  chicago just like baltimore maryland just like washington dc just like those cities and then
[1:34:59.160 --> 1:35:03.560]  they make it legal for criminals to commit crimes and the police can't chase criminals
[1:35:03.560 --> 1:35:09.880]  and now juveniles can't be arrested in california if they commit crimes so of course the cartels
[1:35:09.880 --> 1:35:19.880]  are going to use kids even more it's crazy the cruise demon had had police called on him 44 times
[1:35:19.880 --> 1:35:28.280]  saying he was going to kill people at his high school he was already expelled when it happened
[1:35:28.280 --> 1:35:35.480]  the fbi had been called multiple times and then the police stood down in broward county and let
[1:35:35.480 --> 1:35:41.080]  him kill and the media said that was fake news when i said it but it was all true we had real
[1:35:41.080 --> 1:35:50.200]  students on the day after on skype from the school outside of it and they went jones has actors on
[1:35:51.640 --> 1:35:54.440]  what they always say that i say they're having actors
[1:35:56.840 --> 1:35:58.920]  when it's other people saying that about cases
[1:35:58.920 --> 1:36:06.920]  and then they say i'm hiring actors no in virginia they had groups that hired protesters
[1:36:08.680 --> 1:36:12.520]  that was in the news didn't mean that it was fake when the woman got killed
[1:36:12.520 --> 1:36:17.880]  but see that's how they operate jones says the woman didn't get killed either didn't say that
[1:36:17.880 --> 1:36:25.960]  they hire things to foment but i did not say that there was not a shooting in florida but see
[1:36:25.960 --> 1:36:31.240]  that's how they misrepresent ladies and gentlemen i said the police stood down under orders and it
[1:36:31.240 --> 1:36:36.760]  came out they did i said that they protected this individual under a leftist policy that the state was
[1:36:37.560 --> 1:36:41.640]  passed but that the county had implemented to let him commit crimes because he had the last name
[1:36:41.640 --> 1:36:47.400]  cruise saying oh we have a program to let minorities get out of jail free and i don't want over
[1:36:47.400 --> 1:36:51.320]  incarceration of nonviolent people but when you're running around psychotic saying you're going to
[1:36:51.320 --> 1:36:58.120]  murder everybody dozens and dozens of times your ass better be locked up that's who you lock up is
[1:36:58.120 --> 1:37:02.600]  people that say they're going to murder people and are trying to do it all right i'm going to stop
[1:37:02.600 --> 1:37:07.320]  ranting i just go off on the second amendment issue i mean i i should probably just read the
[1:37:07.320 --> 1:37:12.360]  bills these are bills the democrats say they support that they're going to pass they've got
[1:37:12.360 --> 1:37:17.400]  control of the entire state the last fella says oh i hope we've turned back to red what because the
[1:37:17.400 --> 1:37:23.400]  governor he says he isn't going to take all the guns now that the democrats have the legislature
[1:37:24.440 --> 1:37:29.880]  they have the courts and they have the governor i appreciate the caller and i hope he's right but
[1:37:29.880 --> 1:37:33.720]  we're going to look more into it we're not finding what he's talking about i'm sure it's there but
[1:37:33.720 --> 1:37:39.080]  just having him say again oh we don't want to take your guns we just want to register him well you
[1:37:39.080 --> 1:37:44.520]  know what that means but i agree on the surface it's good to have him at least back down but you see
[1:37:44.520 --> 1:37:49.560]  they do that to get every time our mass builds up every time we awake and every time we show up
[1:37:49.560 --> 1:37:54.360]  to say no they go we're not doing that and then as soon as we go away they come right back
[1:37:57.800 --> 1:38:01.560]  we have to politically force our will through on this
[1:38:03.960 --> 1:38:10.440]  okay it's been holding the longest year to david is it tyler is it freddy is it pastor sam
[1:38:10.440 --> 1:38:17.160]  is it chase the patriot liberal javon i guess it'd be javon in new jersey thanks for holding
[1:38:17.160 --> 1:38:26.120]  her on the air hey alex uh pleasure calling i just want to plug real quick your x2 uh normally
[1:38:26.120 --> 1:38:33.560]  around this time uh of the year i get a lot of uh mucus buildup ever since i've been taking x2
[1:38:33.560 --> 1:38:40.440]  this year i haven't had any mucus um i didn't know about iodine until i started listening to your
[1:38:40.440 --> 1:38:48.680]  program probably about 10 years ago and um it's nowhere else that you know people are going to
[1:38:48.680 --> 1:38:54.360]  talk about iodine people are going to talk about selenium uh that's good for your immune system
[1:38:54.360 --> 1:39:01.880]  it's nowhere else that you're going to hear about the um the the silver bullet uh nascent iodine
[1:39:01.880 --> 1:39:09.560]  that's basically like a magnet for germs um it's very important that this uh radio show be on the
[1:39:09.560 --> 1:39:15.240]  air because i've talked to people all the time they have no clue what iodine is they have no clue what
[1:39:15.880 --> 1:39:25.080]  what um uh silver is and they have no clue what selenium is so it's very important to to listen
[1:39:25.080 --> 1:39:34.360]  to this program because what you're hearing is a modern day uh apostle paul that's looking out for
[1:39:34.360 --> 1:39:41.160]  other human beings and none of none of these none of these other programs are ever going to tell you
[1:39:41.160 --> 1:39:44.760]  things that's going to help you that's going to help your life that's going to benefit you
[1:39:44.760 --> 1:39:50.920]  for longevity for a fight that we're fighting right now and what the enemy tries to do is
[1:39:50.920 --> 1:39:58.280]  he tries to make us sick he tries to destroy our dreams to have us not focus on the things that god
[1:39:59.000 --> 1:40:05.080]  put in front of us god wants us to be prosperous and health and financially as well and that's why
[1:40:05.080 --> 1:40:13.960]  i support this broadcast now brother point um it's estimated that of the people living on
[1:40:13.960 --> 1:40:18.760]  earth right now seven and a half billion people three billion of them have mental deficiencies
[1:40:18.760 --> 1:40:24.520]  because of uh lack of iodine and iodine deficiencies so i mean that that just gives you an idea of
[1:40:24.520 --> 1:40:31.560]  how huge this is yes sir uh people don't know anything about the thyroid and that's in their
[1:40:31.560 --> 1:40:39.480]  body they don't know what the thyroid is for and they have one you know and i tell them all the time
[1:40:39.480 --> 1:40:46.120]  you know iodine protects the thyroid from you know airborne pathogens in that in the air that
[1:40:46.120 --> 1:40:55.160]  we breathe you know and you know i try to inform as many people as i as i can um but i called in uh
[1:40:55.960 --> 1:41:02.280]  i said i i brought up about a red dawn scenario i always tell people it's a veil behind the veil
[1:41:02.280 --> 1:41:10.200]  this whole thing with iran it's a veil like you said you feel that something big is coming and i
[1:41:10.200 --> 1:41:16.360]  believe that as well that's why they're using this as a tactic they want to divide and conquer
[1:41:16.360 --> 1:41:21.640]  everybody's looking at america if they could bring down america they have been awarded
[1:41:21.640 --> 1:41:27.880]  they have it they want to they want a red dawn scenario in america they want an escape from la
[1:41:27.880 --> 1:41:34.120]  the movie escape from la with kurt russell they want that in this country if they get that then
[1:41:34.120 --> 1:41:40.680]  they could write the narrative and that's what they believe in but we have to understand the
[1:41:40.680 --> 1:41:45.560]  times and days that we live in and we have to have discernment and a lot of people don't if
[1:41:45.560 --> 1:41:54.280]  they can call civil unrest they will do it it's a it's a it's a very tactful tactic they can use
[1:41:54.280 --> 1:42:01.000]  to get total domination we could wipe out any country on the face of the earth with the with
[1:42:01.000 --> 1:42:08.120]  the nuclear powers that we have they want to bring us down for a specific purpose for a specific
[1:42:08.120 --> 1:42:14.120]  reason you're absolutely right and and that's why the globalist around the clock with soros
[1:42:14.120 --> 1:42:20.760]  are all trying to foment civil war it's why netflix has constant racial division constant attacks on
[1:42:20.760 --> 1:42:26.360]  the family a constant attacks on men and fatherly strong figures just do not exist anywhere in the
[1:42:26.360 --> 1:42:31.240]  media because they don't want any leadership and they want us atomized and alone so they can
[1:42:31.240 --> 1:42:35.960]  literally topple us and take us over and the whole world will fall to the world government system

[1:43:17.960 --> 1:43:23.000]  these products that i'm just going to go ahead and keep the sale going for two more days and we're
[1:43:23.000 --> 1:43:29.080]  going to basically sell out of all of our major product lines it'll take weeks months for them
[1:43:29.080 --> 1:43:32.840]  all to come back in some come in in weeks some come in in like three months a lot of stuff's
[1:43:32.840 --> 1:43:37.720]  coming back in next week so i've just decided because of the inventory issues all the rest of it
[1:43:37.720 --> 1:43:41.960]  and because some of these were selling it losses are making people buy a lot of other stuff and
[1:43:41.960 --> 1:43:46.840]  we are making a profit so i'm going to just keep the sale going but only for 48 hours maximum and
[1:43:46.840 --> 1:43:53.080]  then we've got to stop it in full or store.com the year end now 2020 mega blowout sale in full

[1:44:19.080 --> 1:44:23.240]  product that i've ever used in my life i literally just took turbo force on my way to the gym right
[1:44:23.240 --> 1:44:28.200]  now i've had four shoulder surgeries and the back surgery and that bodies has made me feel better
[1:44:28.200 --> 1:44:32.280]  than any type of physical therapy or anything that i've ever done in my life so i just want to get
[1:44:32.280 --> 1:44:36.760]  that out of the way support this man everything that he exposed nobody knew about behemian grove
[1:44:36.760 --> 1:44:41.880]  nobody knew about fc nobody knew about bill de berg nobody called 9 11 before it happened in july
[1:44:41.880 --> 1:44:45.880]  2001 go look it up yourself well we try our best sir they definitely want to stop the
[1:44:45.880 --> 1:44:49.000]  year without you we're not here but yeah these are all great products so thank you sir
[1:44:56.760 --> 1:45:03.800]  i keep my eye on the news all the time but i miss the fact that in late 2019 just about two
[1:45:03.800 --> 1:45:14.680]  weeks ago the cdc and the fda approved live ebola vaccine to be given inside the united states and
[1:45:14.680 --> 1:45:22.920]  it is an experimental vaccine it is live it's not even attenuated they've just genetically modified
[1:45:22.920 --> 1:45:29.480]  it so it's supposedly non-lethal same stuff they did with the garter cell vaccine that's admittedly
[1:45:29.480 --> 1:45:35.800]  killed and made so many this is just crazy and the congos had the biggest outbreaks of ebola ever
[1:45:35.800 --> 1:45:40.840]  since they started giving the vaccine there in the last few years oh and of course opened the
[1:45:40.840 --> 1:45:47.080]  borders up here and letting people in unvetted the democrats distribute across the country you
[1:45:47.080 --> 1:45:54.120]  cannot make up the magnitude of this insanity and it is an attempted ebola assault on america this
[1:45:54.120 --> 1:46:01.640]  is the new world order the globalists know that i will never willingly give up i've said it many
[1:46:01.640 --> 1:46:09.960]  times i will never give in i will never give up but i could give out and it's very very frustrating
[1:46:09.960 --> 1:46:16.200]  to see them committing all their crimes against humanity to see evil running rampant like this
[1:46:16.200 --> 1:46:22.760]  and to know that most americans have already been silenced in cyberspace that most americans have
[1:46:22.760 --> 1:46:28.840]  already been shadow banned by big tech and to know that most americans feel powerless and don't
[1:46:28.840 --> 1:46:36.280]  realize how much power they have by spreading the word about news wars dot com info wars dot
[1:46:36.280 --> 1:46:41.000]  com and banned on video and that people are hungry for the truth now more than ever and then if you
[1:46:41.000 --> 1:46:46.680]  tell people hey the banned truth they don't want you to have is at info wars dot com forward slash
[1:46:46.680 --> 1:46:52.440]  show and banned on video so take heart folks they've had to censor everybody to show everybody down
[1:46:52.440 --> 1:46:55.720]  because the truth is powerful and they can't beat us fair and square
[1:46:59.560 --> 1:47:06.280]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:47:06.280 --> 1:47:20.120]  so
[1:47:36.280 --> 1:47:43.920]  Welcome to your life, there's no turning back.
[1:47:43.920 --> 1:47:45.400]  All right, folks, a little bit earlier,
[1:47:45.400 --> 1:47:49.280]  I was going from memory when I was saying 3 billion people.
[1:47:49.280 --> 1:47:52.680]  The UN says have iodine deficiency
[1:47:52.680 --> 1:47:55.400]  and have had mental disabilities from it.
[1:47:55.400 --> 1:47:58.880]  But the latest numbers I've got from the National Institute
[1:47:58.880 --> 1:48:02.360]  of Health, because Wikipedia has changed its entry
[1:48:02.360 --> 1:48:04.440]  and removed it probably because we were talking about it,
[1:48:04.440 --> 1:48:06.720]  one that they have that said 3 billion.
[1:48:06.720 --> 1:48:11.120]  This says the IDD is concerned a public health problem
[1:48:11.120 --> 1:48:13.640]  worldwide affecting all groups of people
[1:48:13.640 --> 1:48:15.320]  of which children and lactating women
[1:48:15.320 --> 1:48:17.720]  are the most vulnerable categories.
[1:48:17.720 --> 1:48:20.160]  At a global scale, approximately 2 million people
[1:48:20.160 --> 1:48:24.480]  suffer iodine deficiency, of which approximately 50 million
[1:48:24.480 --> 1:48:27.400]  present the clinical manifestations in daily food
[1:48:27.400 --> 1:48:28.240]  intake.
[1:48:28.240 --> 1:48:30.240]  And I'm going to go into the Wikipedia entries
[1:48:30.240 --> 1:48:32.600]  and see who removed that, because it
[1:48:32.600 --> 1:48:37.280]  had links to government reports saying 3.2 billion.
[1:48:37.280 --> 1:48:40.080]  And I know we even did shows on that about a month ago
[1:48:40.080 --> 1:48:41.160]  and showed it.
[1:48:41.160 --> 1:48:43.680]  So I'll go into the Wikipedia entries.
[1:48:43.680 --> 1:48:45.680]  But this is so important, I should just go off air.
[1:48:45.680 --> 1:48:50.000]  Seriously, if a nuke went off over a major city,
[1:48:50.000 --> 1:48:54.920]  we'd all pause to grasp it if 10 million people died.
[1:48:54.920 --> 1:48:57.800]  Let's say Los Angeles got hit by a 300 megaton bomb,
[1:48:57.800 --> 1:49:00.640]  killed everybody.
[1:49:00.640 --> 1:49:03.760]  But billions get brain damage, they admit it,
[1:49:03.760 --> 1:49:05.560]  and then someone went into Wikipedia,
[1:49:05.560 --> 1:49:08.200]  because we just spent the last few segments looking it up
[1:49:08.200 --> 1:49:09.920]  and removed it out.
[1:49:09.920 --> 1:49:12.560]  And now I went and found it, we went and found it.
[1:49:12.560 --> 1:49:14.560]  Actually, the boom operator found it
[1:49:14.560 --> 1:49:20.640]  in the National Institutes of Health
[1:49:20.640 --> 1:49:25.280]  and other organizations saying 2 billion people.
[1:49:25.280 --> 1:49:27.600]  So again, that's a big deal.
[1:49:27.600 --> 1:49:30.520]  And it's a bigger deal, who's going into Wikipedia
[1:49:30.520 --> 1:49:33.720]  and removing the entry that said 3 billion.
[1:49:33.720 --> 1:49:34.960]  The point is, it's a big deal.
[1:49:34.960 --> 1:49:36.480]  If it said a million, it'd be a big deal.
[1:49:36.480 --> 1:49:38.040]  If it said 500 million, it'd be huge.
[1:49:38.040 --> 1:49:40.320]  If it said a billion, it'd be incredible.
[1:49:40.320 --> 1:49:41.080]  Is it 2 billion?
[1:49:41.080 --> 1:49:42.160]  Is it 3 billion?
[1:49:42.160 --> 1:49:43.720]  We ought to make this a bigger deal.
[1:49:43.720 --> 1:49:47.400]  We ought to find out what's going on,
[1:49:47.400 --> 1:49:51.040]  because they're putting the bad halogen, the fluoride
[1:49:51.040 --> 1:49:53.160]  in the water, and then taking the good halogen out
[1:49:53.160 --> 1:49:56.000]  of everything, and it's making people docile and sluggish
[1:49:56.000 --> 1:49:56.960]  and stupid.
[1:49:56.960 --> 1:49:58.800]  Thank you.
[1:49:58.800 --> 1:50:00.960]  And I was kind of running around here all aggressively
[1:50:00.960 --> 1:50:01.560]  during the break.
[1:50:01.560 --> 1:50:02.480]  I appreciate the crew.
[1:50:02.480 --> 1:50:03.640]  This makes me angry.
[1:50:06.520 --> 1:50:08.600]  We'd probably find my old folders on I&I.
[1:50:08.600 --> 1:50:10.120]  And actually, where we had the Wikipedia printed
[1:50:10.120 --> 1:50:11.840]  and show how they removed it, because there's
[1:50:11.840 --> 1:50:13.280]  a lot of stuff that's New York Times,
[1:50:13.280 --> 1:50:15.160]  China confronts retardation of millions
[1:50:15.160 --> 1:50:17.040]  deficient in I&I, New York Times.
[1:50:17.040 --> 1:50:18.120]  Let's see, that's 1996.
[1:50:18.120 --> 1:50:20.120]  You don't hear that anymore, even though it's worse,
[1:50:20.120 --> 1:50:20.920]  they're saying.
[1:50:20.920 --> 1:50:22.760]  Pregnant mothers and the dangers of I&I deficiency,
[1:50:22.760 --> 1:50:25.520]  London Guardian, 2016.
[1:50:25.520 --> 1:50:26.560]  I'm going to stop ranting.
[1:50:26.560 --> 1:50:28.760]  I said, I'd go to your calls, and now I'm not doing it.
[1:50:28.760 --> 1:50:31.400]  It just makes me so angry that they want us dumb
[1:50:31.400 --> 1:50:32.280]  and want us controlled.
[1:50:32.280 --> 1:50:35.120]  And yes, I went off on the jab because the caller talked
[1:50:35.120 --> 1:50:36.040]  about the product.
[1:50:36.040 --> 1:50:38.560]  X2, X3 are both excellent sources of I&I.
[1:50:38.560 --> 1:50:39.880]  X2 is sold out.
[1:50:39.880 --> 1:50:41.200]  X3 is excellent.
[1:50:41.200 --> 1:50:42.480]  In fact, for some people, it's better.
[1:50:42.480 --> 1:50:44.760]  It's three types of I&I uploaded together.
[1:50:44.760 --> 1:50:46.160]  That's my Vaso Beats.
[1:50:46.160 --> 1:50:48.720]  It's still 60% off at m4store.com.
[1:50:48.720 --> 1:50:50.880]  And that's how we fund our operation.
[1:50:50.880 --> 1:50:53.880]  Vaso Beats is still 60% off, but that's going to have to end.
[1:50:53.880 --> 1:50:56.120]  And the sale's still going, but it's essentially over,
[1:50:56.120 --> 1:50:58.360]  because more than half the products are sold out right now.
[1:50:58.360 --> 1:51:00.320]  And I want to thank you all for your support.
[1:51:00.320 --> 1:51:02.240]  Store Ride Free Shipping is still going right now.
[1:51:02.240 --> 1:51:08.360]  There's X3 with 100% support rate on it.
[1:51:08.360 --> 1:51:10.360]  OK, let's go ahead and go back to the callers here.
[1:51:10.360 --> 1:51:11.120]  Thanks for holding.
[1:51:11.120 --> 1:51:13.280]  I said I'd get to five of them, but I never will now.
[1:51:13.280 --> 1:51:14.800]  David in California are on the air.
[1:51:14.800 --> 1:51:17.080]  Go ahead.
[1:51:17.080 --> 1:51:18.680]  How you doing, Alex?
[1:51:18.680 --> 1:51:19.720]  I'm pretty fired up.
[1:51:19.720 --> 1:51:22.920]  You know, that caller calling in about that,
[1:51:22.920 --> 1:51:23.840]  and then I go look it up.
[1:51:23.840 --> 1:51:25.600]  And Wikipedia is taking it off there.
[1:51:25.600 --> 1:51:28.480]  That it said 3 billion people have mental deficiencies
[1:51:28.480 --> 1:51:30.840]  because of iodine deficiency, and now they've pulled it.
[1:51:30.840 --> 1:51:32.520]  That's pretty crazy.
[1:51:32.520 --> 1:51:33.840]  Yeah, that's pretty crazy.
[1:51:33.840 --> 1:51:36.440]  But if it makes you feel any better,
[1:51:36.440 --> 1:51:39.520]  I'd say a large portion of your customers,
[1:51:39.520 --> 1:51:43.520]  their purchase, X2 and X3, like myself, and not only that,
[1:51:43.520 --> 1:51:47.840]  but the B12, the Vaso Beats, the honor roll, jeez.
[1:51:47.840 --> 1:51:49.680]  And I'm just kind of wondering, you kind of
[1:51:49.680 --> 1:51:52.000]  touch bases on this previous caller,
[1:51:52.000 --> 1:51:54.080]  but kind of wondering when that's going to come in.
[1:51:54.080 --> 1:51:56.840]  I'm really anxious for that one because it does wonders for my son.
[1:51:56.840 --> 1:52:00.760]  But I just wanted to say real quick that the most effective
[1:52:00.760 --> 1:52:03.920]  thing for me, the one thing that caused me to actually go out
[1:52:03.920 --> 1:52:06.520]  and buy the products is saying all the other callers
[1:52:06.520 --> 1:52:09.840]  talking about all these things that it's done for them,
[1:52:09.840 --> 1:52:12.560]  and their loved ones, and the kids, and all that.
[1:52:12.560 --> 1:52:16.280]  So I think the more callers calling to plug in an item,
[1:52:16.280 --> 1:52:19.840]  the more effective it is for people listening to actually go out
[1:52:19.840 --> 1:52:22.720]  and try to experience the product themselves.
[1:52:22.720 --> 1:52:25.880]  But I wanted to make a couple points, one,
[1:52:25.880 --> 1:52:27.840]  in regards to the whole Virginia thing
[1:52:27.840 --> 1:52:32.360]  with that Governor Northam duty.
[1:52:32.360 --> 1:52:35.600]  I mean, you try to, I mean, what does the government do
[1:52:35.600 --> 1:52:39.600]  once it disarms its people?
[1:52:39.600 --> 1:52:41.800]  I'm sorry, that last little part cut out there.
[1:52:41.800 --> 1:52:43.320]  Say that again, sir.
[1:52:43.320 --> 1:52:47.120]  I said, what does the government do once it disarms its people?
[1:52:47.120 --> 1:52:50.200]  It enslaves them, and then usually kills them.
[1:52:50.200 --> 1:52:52.240]  Whatever it wants to do.
[1:52:52.240 --> 1:52:54.320]  And now Governor Northam is telling me
[1:52:54.320 --> 1:52:57.320]  that I can't train Jiu Jitsu, I can't train boxing,
[1:52:57.320 --> 1:52:59.040]  I can't train Muay Thai.
[1:52:59.040 --> 1:53:01.120]  Yeah, that's kind of absurd to me,
[1:53:01.120 --> 1:53:02.840]  but it just goes to show their insanity
[1:53:02.840 --> 1:53:04.400]  and where they're trying to take things.
[1:53:04.400 --> 1:53:08.280]  Well, they banned dodgeball 20 years ago in most schools,
[1:53:08.280 --> 1:53:12.560]  and then a decade later they banned running at break
[1:53:12.560 --> 1:53:14.040]  or any type of physical contact,
[1:53:14.040 --> 1:53:16.040]  and now they're telling the kids don't shake hands.
[1:53:16.040 --> 1:53:17.240]  It's a cult.
[1:53:17.240 --> 1:53:18.880]  I mean, it's like a super max prison,
[1:53:18.880 --> 1:53:20.840]  and of course they don't want men
[1:53:20.840 --> 1:53:22.280]  getting into being rugged again
[1:53:22.280 --> 1:53:26.320]  and discovering close combat sports
[1:53:26.320 --> 1:53:28.040]  because they don't want it raising
[1:53:28.040 --> 1:53:29.800]  your testosterone naturally.
[1:53:29.800 --> 1:53:32.280]  I mean, I did 30 minutes of deadlifts this morning.
[1:53:32.280 --> 1:53:34.440]  I am high as a kite naturally.
[1:53:34.440 --> 1:53:36.640]  Off of that, everybody knows it boosts your testosterone
[1:53:36.640 --> 1:53:39.680]  naturally, and I did 30 minutes of deadlifts, no big deal.
[1:53:39.680 --> 1:53:41.120]  I did some heavy bench press,
[1:53:41.120 --> 1:53:42.640]  I only do that like every couple of weeks
[1:53:42.640 --> 1:53:44.040]  because you have joints and things,
[1:53:44.040 --> 1:53:46.240]  and I feel like I could tear somebody's head off.
[1:53:46.240 --> 1:53:48.840]  But that's good, but they're scared of that.
[1:53:48.840 --> 1:53:51.120]  They don't want the general public being able
[1:53:51.120 --> 1:53:52.160]  to take care of themselves
[1:53:52.160 --> 1:53:54.120]  because they're a bunch of criminal oppressors.
[1:53:54.120 --> 1:53:57.160]  Do criminals wanna target somebody that's disarmed
[1:53:57.160 --> 1:53:58.800]  and in a wheelchair they can rob,
[1:53:58.800 --> 1:54:00.640]  or do they wanna take on a big tough man?
[1:54:00.640 --> 1:54:02.560]  No, they wanna target women and children,
[1:54:02.560 --> 1:54:06.240]  and that's why they want men to be like lobotomized children
[1:54:06.240 --> 1:54:08.520]  so they can have their way with the babies
[1:54:08.520 --> 1:54:12.240]  like Governor Blackface KKK Northam wants to.
[1:54:12.240 --> 1:54:13.400]  Hell, he didn't want to.
[1:54:13.400 --> 1:54:18.400]  He ran operations at hospitals harvesting babies' organs.
[1:54:18.400 --> 1:54:21.440]  The son of a goblin is a frickin' daemon.
[1:54:21.440 --> 1:54:23.640]  So of course he wants his enemies disarmed
[1:54:23.640 --> 1:54:27.040]  so he can have his little peckerwood way with us.
[1:54:28.600 --> 1:54:30.840]  And you guys made a really good point yesterday
[1:54:30.840 --> 1:54:33.120]  while I was listening to the late broadcast
[1:54:33.120 --> 1:54:35.720]  you guys had when the whole stuff
[1:54:35.720 --> 1:54:38.440]  started hitting the fan last night.
[1:54:38.440 --> 1:54:39.920]  I forgot who it was and made a good point
[1:54:39.920 --> 1:54:42.200]  that right now, if anything,
[1:54:42.200 --> 1:54:45.760]  the biggest threat and obstacle to the president
[1:54:45.760 --> 1:54:47.600]  is the people within the country
[1:54:47.600 --> 1:54:51.480]  that are trying to basically undermine him
[1:54:51.480 --> 1:54:54.280]  and then working these other channels through Iran
[1:54:54.280 --> 1:54:57.760]  and these other places that don't wanna see,
[1:54:58.920 --> 1:55:01.440]  that don't wanna see our president do the right thing.
[1:55:01.440 --> 1:55:02.600]  And when he does the right thing,
[1:55:02.600 --> 1:55:06.320]  it seems like it's always try to be flipped around.
[1:55:06.320 --> 1:55:09.360]  And I'm counting down the clock until Pelosi
[1:55:09.360 --> 1:55:11.600]  and the other rats come out and say
[1:55:11.600 --> 1:55:13.520]  that the president's response was weak
[1:55:13.520 --> 1:55:15.640]  and that therefore war all of a sudden.
[1:55:15.640 --> 1:55:18.080]  I mean, it's like clockwork and these people,
[1:55:18.080 --> 1:55:21.040]  you can basically see the reaction on that
[1:55:21.040 --> 1:55:22.360]  and Trump really exposed that.
[1:55:22.360 --> 1:55:24.520]  And I just think that right now,
[1:55:24.520 --> 1:55:27.000]  the biggest threat to the president
[1:55:27.000 --> 1:55:30.280]  is these people that are trying to undermine him
[1:55:30.280 --> 1:55:34.360]  from within and they're using this whole Iran situation
[1:55:34.360 --> 1:55:38.920]  and all these other little sparks to try
[1:55:38.920 --> 1:55:40.320]  and play it against them.
[1:55:40.320 --> 1:55:41.680]  But it just seems like he's too much
[1:55:41.680 --> 1:55:43.520]  of a good 4D chess player
[1:55:43.520 --> 1:55:45.360]  because he's calling them on their bluff.
[1:55:45.360 --> 1:55:48.000]  And honestly, I mean, I've had relatives
[1:55:48.000 --> 1:55:49.440]  that's gone and fight in Iraq,
[1:55:49.440 --> 1:55:51.520]  several relatives that gone and done tours in Iraq.
[1:55:51.520 --> 1:55:54.000]  And I hate to say, but if the Iraqi leaders
[1:55:54.000 --> 1:55:55.240]  who doesn't want us there,
[1:55:55.240 --> 1:55:57.760]  then they can go ahead and be a proxy set of Iran
[1:55:57.760 --> 1:56:01.400]  as much as they want because that to me just tells me
[1:56:01.400 --> 1:56:03.760]  that it's, I mean, even-
[1:56:03.760 --> 1:56:04.600]  No, I agree.
[1:56:04.600 --> 1:56:06.360]  But I like how Trump said,
[1:56:06.360 --> 1:56:08.880]  we're basically pulling out and we want NATO,
[1:56:08.880 --> 1:56:10.360]  if folks want security in the Gulf,
[1:56:10.360 --> 1:56:11.520]  have NATO come in and do it.
[1:56:11.520 --> 1:56:13.440]  Why the hell do we pay for it?
[1:56:13.440 --> 1:56:16.040]  Because Iran threatens to block the trade of Hormuz all the time.
[1:56:16.040 --> 1:56:17.840]  I say, let them all kill each other.
[1:56:20.040 --> 1:56:23.240]  Yep. And I think he's kind of seen that.
[1:56:23.240 --> 1:56:25.760]  I'd hope, and you guys also made a complaint yesterday
[1:56:25.760 --> 1:56:28.000]  about him being surrounded by these war hawks
[1:56:28.000 --> 1:56:30.400]  and took costs and also kind of touched on this.
[1:56:30.400 --> 1:56:33.320]  And I mean, I think there's a lot of truth to that.
[1:56:33.320 --> 1:56:36.600]  And I think that the more he fails to recognize
[1:56:36.600 --> 1:56:38.040]  that he's surrounded by these people
[1:56:38.040 --> 1:56:40.240]  that just want to put him in some predicament,
[1:56:40.240 --> 1:56:43.680]  it's not going to do him any favors
[1:56:43.680 --> 1:56:48.040]  until he fixes that and then gets these people out of there
[1:56:48.040 --> 1:56:49.320]  and then puts these people
[1:56:49.320 --> 1:56:52.280]  that are basically coming to trees and behind bars.
[1:56:53.280 --> 1:56:54.280]  Well said, David.
[1:56:54.280 --> 1:56:55.240]  Well said.
[1:56:55.240 --> 1:56:56.360]  Well said.
[1:56:56.360 --> 1:56:57.680]  All right, I got to one call that segment,
[1:56:57.680 --> 1:56:59.240]  but he was a great caller.
[1:56:59.240 --> 1:57:02.360]  Up next, Chase the Patriots that we're going to speak
[1:57:02.360 --> 1:57:07.360]  to John and Pastor Sam and Mike and everybody else,
[1:57:07.920 --> 1:57:09.840]  liberal, we got a liberal next, actually,
[1:57:09.840 --> 1:57:10.720]  when we come back.
[1:57:11.840 --> 1:57:15.560]  I've kind of gotten OCD or kind of Ash Berger-ish
[1:57:15.560 --> 1:57:17.280]  about information,
[1:57:17.280 --> 1:57:19.880]  because I knew Wikipedia had in the epidemiology section
[1:57:19.880 --> 1:57:22.960]  a link to the CDC and a bunch of other government sites
[1:57:22.960 --> 1:57:27.040]  admitting 3 billion people had cognitive disabilities
[1:57:27.040 --> 1:57:30.320]  from lack of iodine, the biggest health crisis in the world.
[1:57:30.320 --> 1:57:32.840]  We found on the way back machine, they did remove it,
[1:57:32.840 --> 1:57:34.640]  even though it was linked to government documents.
[1:57:34.640 --> 1:57:37.240]  That made me so angry during the last break
[1:57:37.240 --> 1:57:39.360]  that I was running around like a piranha
[1:57:39.360 --> 1:57:40.200]  trying to find it.
[1:57:40.200 --> 1:57:42.360]  I mean, it's just sick what these people do
[1:57:42.360 --> 1:57:44.160]  while they're right back, stay with us.
[1:57:46.160 --> 1:57:49.320]  It's either happened to every person listening
[1:57:49.320 --> 1:57:51.760]  or it's happened to someone you know.
[1:57:51.760 --> 1:57:54.960]  Everybody is well aware of the fact
[1:57:54.960 --> 1:57:58.400]  that most people that end up getting the flu
[1:57:58.400 --> 1:58:01.680]  have taken the flu vaccine right before they get it
[1:58:01.680 --> 1:58:06.120]  and that they get the worst case of the flu of their life.
[1:58:06.120 --> 1:58:09.880]  But still, like concentration camp victims,
[1:58:09.880 --> 1:58:13.480]  they line up at the different pharmacies and clinics
[1:58:13.480 --> 1:58:15.000]  to get the injections.
[1:58:15.000 --> 1:58:16.640]  It doesn't matter that studies,
[1:58:16.640 --> 1:58:19.440]  mainline government studies in Canada and Europe show
[1:58:19.440 --> 1:58:21.320]  that when you take the flu vaccine,
[1:58:21.320 --> 1:58:24.600]  it doubles your chances of getting the flu the next season
[1:58:24.600 --> 1:58:26.120]  by lowering your immunity.
[1:58:26.120 --> 1:58:27.640]  It goes on and on.
[1:58:27.640 --> 1:58:29.240]  Or the fact that the governments
[1:58:29.240 --> 1:58:32.320]  have never guessed the next year's mutation
[1:58:32.320 --> 1:58:36.560]  that the flu vaccine has never, ever even worked.
[1:58:36.560 --> 1:58:38.040]  But how do you prop up a hoax?
[1:58:38.040 --> 1:58:40.480]  You keep the giant hoax going.
[1:58:40.480 --> 1:58:42.480]  No wonder we've got one of the worst flu seasons
[1:58:42.480 --> 1:58:44.320]  on record happening right now.
[1:58:46.680 --> 1:58:49.080]  I want to talk about super silver whitening toothpaste
[1:58:49.080 --> 1:58:50.600]  because I hadn't tried it
[1:58:50.600 --> 1:58:52.400]  except for maybe the last week and a half.
[1:58:52.400 --> 1:58:54.600]  And I told Alex, I said, man,
[1:58:54.600 --> 1:58:56.080]  this is the best toothpaste I've ever tried.
[1:58:56.080 --> 1:58:57.480]  He's like, well, what are you doing
[1:58:57.480 --> 1:58:58.400]  just sitting in here telling me?
[1:58:58.400 --> 1:59:00.200]  You got to get up there and tell people.
[1:59:00.200 --> 1:59:04.440]  So here I am telling people super silver whitening toothpaste
[1:59:04.440 --> 1:59:07.800]  is by far the best toothpaste I've ever tried.
[1:59:07.800 --> 1:59:09.040]  And I'm 45 years old
[1:59:09.040 --> 1:59:10.960]  and I've tried a lot of different toothpaste.
[1:59:10.960 --> 1:59:12.680]  And it's fluoride free.
[1:59:12.680 --> 1:59:13.920]  I think the big difference,
[1:59:13.920 --> 1:59:15.960]  the game changer in this is the coral calcium
[1:59:15.960 --> 1:59:18.280]  because after I brush my teeth with this,
[1:59:18.280 --> 1:59:20.760]  they feel so clean and the toothpaste
[1:59:20.760 --> 1:59:22.760]  that I don't even like rinse out my mouth
[1:59:22.760 --> 1:59:24.200]  after I brush my teeth with this.
[1:59:24.200 --> 1:59:25.480]  It feels so good.
[1:59:25.480 --> 1:59:28.400]  It feels like it feels like good things
[1:59:28.400 --> 1:59:29.680]  are happening in my mouth.
[1:59:29.680 --> 1:59:32.640]  In fact, I find myself brushing my teeth
[1:59:32.640 --> 1:59:34.120]  three to four times a day
[1:59:34.120 --> 1:59:35.760]  rather than just twice a day now
[1:59:35.760 --> 1:59:37.880]  because I like the way it feels.
[1:59:37.880 --> 1:59:59.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:08.640 --> 2:00:15.360]  We are back live into hour number three.
[2:00:15.360 --> 2:00:20.400]  Clear the decks so that you take your calls.
[2:00:20.400 --> 2:00:23.600]  But then Barrio said to me, she said,
[2:00:23.600 --> 2:00:28.240]  hey, we really should see what Steve Pachinik thinks about this.
[2:00:28.240 --> 2:00:29.920]  And I said, he usually won't come on short notice
[2:00:29.920 --> 2:00:30.920]  but call him and see.
[2:00:30.920 --> 2:00:33.840]  And sure enough, he went to yoga class
[2:00:33.840 --> 2:00:36.160]  and he called back and said, oh, come on,
[2:00:36.160 --> 2:00:37.960]  so he's coming out the bottom of the hour.
[2:00:37.960 --> 2:00:40.960]  Mike Adams is very prepared.
[2:00:40.960 --> 2:00:44.480]  He's always extremely informative, quite frankly.
[2:00:44.480 --> 2:00:45.320]  Very thought provoking.
[2:00:45.320 --> 2:00:47.680]  But he says today is a special fourth hour
[2:00:47.680 --> 2:00:51.560]  out of the war room with Owen Schroyer and Savannah Hernandez.
[2:00:51.560 --> 2:00:54.040]  And yes, more and more Savannah is going to be co-hosting
[2:00:54.040 --> 2:00:55.040]  on the war room in here.
[2:00:55.040 --> 2:00:55.880]  I really like her.
[2:00:55.880 --> 2:00:56.720]  Everybody likes her.
[2:00:56.720 --> 2:00:58.720]  She's really smart.
[2:00:58.720 --> 2:01:01.880]  And Savannah and I are getting married next week.
[2:01:01.880 --> 2:01:02.880]  It's a joke.
[2:01:02.880 --> 2:01:06.400]  And she's marrying Bill Hicks.
[2:01:06.400 --> 2:01:08.600]  It's a joke.
[2:01:08.600 --> 2:01:09.440]  It's a joke.
[2:01:09.440 --> 2:01:13.480]  OK, who are we going to take calls from here?
[2:01:13.480 --> 2:01:14.720]  Who's been holding the longest?
[2:01:14.720 --> 2:01:17.440]  That would be liberal in New York.
[2:01:17.440 --> 2:01:20.800]  Liberal, what is your view on the situation?
[2:01:20.800 --> 2:01:24.360]  Yeah, Alex, first I wanted to speak on the Iran issue.
[2:01:24.360 --> 2:01:26.480]  But then I heard the level of aggression
[2:01:26.480 --> 2:01:28.920]  that you had towards Muslims.
[2:01:28.920 --> 2:01:30.840]  That's right, I hide nothing.
[2:01:30.840 --> 2:01:31.720]  I hide nothing.
[2:01:31.720 --> 2:01:32.280]  I admit it.
[2:01:32.280 --> 2:01:34.320]  I'm afraid and I'm angry.
[2:01:34.320 --> 2:01:36.280]  And I'm not going to be politically correct.
[2:01:36.280 --> 2:01:39.680]  If I'm scared of people and I'm scared of lying down,
[2:01:39.680 --> 2:01:40.800]  I'm going to be honest.
[2:01:40.800 --> 2:01:42.460]  I'm not politically correct.
[2:01:42.460 --> 2:01:42.960]  Ah!
[2:01:42.960 --> 2:01:42.960]  Ah!
[2:01:42.960 --> 2:01:42.960]  Ah!
[2:01:42.960 --> 2:01:43.460]  Ah!
[2:01:43.460 --> 2:01:43.960]  Ah!
[2:01:43.960 --> 2:01:43.960]  Ah!
[2:01:43.960 --> 2:01:44.460]  Ah!
[2:01:44.460 --> 2:01:44.960]  Ah!
[2:01:44.960 --> 2:01:44.960]  Ah!
[2:01:44.960 --> 2:01:45.460]  Ah!
[2:01:45.460 --> 2:01:45.960]  Ah!
[2:01:45.960 --> 2:01:45.960]  Ah!
[2:01:45.960 --> 2:01:45.960]  Ah!
[2:01:45.960 --> 2:01:46.460]  Ah!
[2:01:46.460 --> 2:01:46.960]  Ah!
[2:01:46.960 --> 2:01:47.460]  Ah!
[2:01:47.460 --> 2:01:47.460]  Ah!
[2:01:47.460 --> 2:01:47.960]  Ah!
[2:01:47.960 --> 2:01:48.460]  Ah!
[2:01:48.460 --> 2:01:48.960]  Ah!
[2:01:48.960 --> 2:01:49.460]  Ah!
[2:01:49.460 --> 2:01:49.960]  Ah!
[2:01:49.960 --> 2:01:50.460]  Ah!
[2:01:50.460 --> 2:01:50.960]  Ah!
[2:01:50.960 --> 2:01:51.960]  Ah!
[2:01:51.960 --> 2:01:53.440]  Go ahead.
[2:01:53.440 --> 2:01:55.720]  OK, so that is your prohibitive, Alex,
[2:01:55.720 --> 2:01:56.960]  but the reason why I brought this up is because
[2:01:56.960 --> 2:01:57.960]  Oh my God!
[2:01:57.960 --> 2:02:01.920]  There weren't any Muslims 1,400 years ago you run half the planet.
[2:02:01.920 --> 2:02:05.520]  Holy hell, you want to rule me? Just admit it
[2:02:07.280 --> 2:02:10.460]  Okay, okay, we'll get you in for del
[2:02:14.560 --> 2:02:20.280]  Soon you will soon we will put you on galleys and your weapon will serve us well
[2:02:20.920 --> 2:02:22.920]  Tell me I hear the lab
[2:02:22.920 --> 2:02:32.120]  Go ahead, tell me about it. Okay, so the thing is for down what it is for now
[2:02:37.720 --> 2:02:41.480]  But in a like you you've got big balls to me
[2:02:42.120 --> 2:02:43.800]  Alex
[2:02:43.800 --> 2:02:49.080]  Alex it shows to me the efficacy of it shows to me that your son of the Zionist swine
[2:02:49.760 --> 2:02:51.760]  Who will be driven into the ocean?
[2:02:51.760 --> 2:02:58.320]  I'm just imitating the ayatollah right now. No, I understand Alex, but can I get a word in edge wise?
[2:02:58.320 --> 2:03:04.120]  I just wanted I am an infa colony an infidel pig fucker, and I will delay that. Oh my goodness
[2:03:05.360 --> 2:03:07.360]  But in any
[2:03:07.520 --> 2:03:08.720]  thing is that
[2:03:08.720 --> 2:03:15.560]  The efficacy of the propaganda of those that manage all perceptions is great because you want to know you're too important
[2:03:15.560 --> 2:03:22.480]  I'm gonna give you the floor for five minutes, and I apologize to you and I show the disgraceful western man
[2:03:22.480 --> 2:03:28.240]  That needs to be given over to salvation and completion by you and the green flag
[2:03:32.960 --> 2:03:40.000]  So I swear I'm going to let you take over on the other side. Just just don't hang up liberal. I apologize
[2:03:40.000 --> 2:03:44.600]  Hmm, I'm gonna stop right now
[2:03:47.720 --> 2:03:49.720]  Man it feels good to go crazy
[2:03:50.800 --> 2:03:54.840]  Should make fun of the ayatollah. I just need some missiles to start
[2:03:55.720 --> 2:03:57.720]  Maybe I should convert to Islam
[2:03:58.040 --> 2:04:02.480]  I'm jinnu little icon of Mohammed jihad
[2:04:03.720 --> 2:04:05.720]  I changed my name to Islam. What would it be?
[2:04:05.720 --> 2:04:14.280]  All right, I'm gonna stop I'm gonna compose myself, and I apologize ladies and gentlemen the truth is though
[2:04:14.280 --> 2:04:17.800]  I'm not acting. I'm not joking around. I'm completely crazy and everybody knows it
[2:04:18.120 --> 2:04:23.840]  So when we come back tell a prompter free news and information. I am gonna apologize to
[2:04:24.880 --> 2:04:29.560]  Liberal and have this nice person from New York City
[2:04:29.560 --> 2:04:35.200]  Tell us how the cow ate the cabbage. I have shown myself
[2:04:36.080 --> 2:04:38.080]  to be an infidel swine
[2:04:40.560 --> 2:04:45.280]  So well back in 60 seconds, I promise to be a good boy
[2:04:45.280 --> 2:04:51.040]  No need to revisit any of this and our guest will have the floor to say whatever they want
[2:04:52.240 --> 2:04:54.240]  liberal I
[2:04:54.240 --> 2:05:00.320]  I spend a lot of time reminding the info wars a family of listeners and viewers
[2:05:01.360 --> 2:05:05.320]  That without you, we won't be on the air and I spent a lot of time thanking you
[2:05:05.760 --> 2:05:12.240]  But I really think you should thank yourself for keeping us on the air and really changing the world for the better and raising the alarm
[2:05:12.240 --> 2:05:16.280]  Is modern ball reviewers, but something I should spend more time on is just
[2:05:16.960 --> 2:05:20.160]  Reminding you that these products are really amazing
[2:05:20.160 --> 2:05:25.720]  You've got that pledge from me, but you've seen the third-party test out there the air filtration the water filtration
[2:05:25.760 --> 2:05:34.320]  The supplements are all the very best you're gonna find out there and you can't fund an operation anywhere else that's fighting the globalist
[2:05:34.880 --> 2:05:38.960]  This hard so it's not a burden to support info wars
[2:05:39.240 --> 2:05:41.240]  It really is
[2:05:41.240 --> 2:05:48.480]  Something that is good for everybody that stands for justice and freedom and makes your life and your family's life
[2:05:48.480 --> 2:05:53.000]  Your children's life so much better. So visit info or stored calm today
[2:05:53.000 --> 2:06:12.480]  So now I'll be peace
[2:06:12.480 --> 2:06:14.480]  I
[2:06:21.560 --> 2:06:29.320]  Waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[2:06:29.320 --> 2:06:37.360]  And go ahead liberal. Thanks for joining us give us your view on the situation
[2:06:38.360 --> 2:06:41.760]  Okay, Alex with respect to your eminence towards Muslim
[2:06:42.360 --> 2:06:48.080]  It just goes to show how effective the propaganda that these people who manage our world perceptions how great it has worked
[2:06:48.920 --> 2:06:54.520]  You are mine that you are well versed in history, you know the ins and outs, you know, but the hegellian dialectic
[2:06:54.520 --> 2:07:00.520]  Etc. Etc. But from a Muslim perspective or person from the Middle East if you take a look
[2:07:01.040 --> 2:07:05.920]  At the wars of aggression that took place in the 20th century World War one World War two
[2:07:06.320 --> 2:07:08.320]  Vietnam etc. These wars
[2:07:09.040 --> 2:07:15.240]  Were done or the participants were largely Judeo-Christian nation. So from a Muslim perspective
[2:07:15.920 --> 2:07:17.920]  they're stating that
[2:07:17.920 --> 2:07:24.080]  Or they have a feeling or they have been propagandized to the point believing that these people in the West or Christian
[2:07:24.400 --> 2:07:29.800]  As aggressive as aggressive or even more so aggressive than the people's in their culture
[2:07:30.400 --> 2:07:37.640]  Also, these wars we have gotten what we have gotten the League of Nations the United Nations the IMF the World Bank etc
[2:07:37.640 --> 2:07:40.800]  Etc. Etc. And these institutions have been oppressed
[2:07:41.400 --> 2:07:43.400]  Not only in the Middle East
[2:07:43.400 --> 2:07:51.640]  institutions have been oppressed not only Muslim nations, but other nations. So it is understood
[2:07:51.920 --> 2:07:58.640]  That you cannot have any deals with these people and when I say these people I'm talking about people the governments that run the West
[2:07:59.560 --> 2:08:07.360]  So I think it's important for you and a specialist thing audience because you have your audience is so large and
[2:08:07.400 --> 2:08:12.000]  As you stated multiple times before it's your audience that actually got trumped into power
[2:08:12.000 --> 2:08:18.200]  I believe it's your responsibility to just I understand that you don't want to be politically correct
[2:08:18.200 --> 2:08:20.520]  but you should pull back just a bit and
[2:08:21.600 --> 2:08:28.120]  Demonstrate to your audience that is the propaganda that is propelling these two the largest feats in the world and
[2:08:28.800 --> 2:08:30.800]  Onto a collision court
[2:08:30.800 --> 2:08:35.680]  Muslims versus Christians and if you can remember it was what's the same the free
[2:08:36.320 --> 2:08:38.960]  The Pope of Freemasonry. I believe the same much
[2:08:38.960 --> 2:08:44.560]  What was the same pike Albert Pike the counter of the KKK top Democrat? Yes
[2:08:45.600 --> 2:08:47.800]  So he had his prophecy as he called it
[2:08:47.800 --> 2:08:54.640]  But I believe it to be a blueprint Alex where they spoke about it would be a big clash between Muslims and Christians and as
[2:08:55.640 --> 2:09:01.840]  I guess times came to the end or where just before the new world order would come come into play and
[2:09:02.120 --> 2:09:06.000]  That clash would lead to the birth of a new religion
[2:09:06.000 --> 2:09:09.200]  And this is what I'm essentially seeing Alex and as I said to you
[2:09:09.200 --> 2:09:11.680]  I know that your manual well read your well-versed in
[2:09:12.280 --> 2:09:15.200]  Historical masters and I think you did used to be a bit more
[2:09:16.080 --> 2:09:20.280]  Responsibility on your part as you relate this information to your listening audio
[2:09:20.280 --> 2:09:20.720]  well
[2:09:20.720 --> 2:09:26.080]  I think that was very well said sir and you're absolutely right and and I don't want to say that I have a dual mind
[2:09:26.520 --> 2:09:33.840]  But sometimes if I am having an emotional thought I just say why not just go ahead and have it on air to be the opposite of the controlled
[2:09:33.840 --> 2:09:39.480]  Calculated teleprompter readers. So sometimes I'm very intellectual other times. I've had too much coffee
[2:09:39.480 --> 2:09:43.800]  I just had a little bit of fun being politically incorrect and look here's the I know there are a lot of great Muslims
[2:09:43.800 --> 2:09:50.920]  Really a lot of nice Muslims had friends that have even Muslims in high school and college were very hard-working nice business people the whole nine yards
[2:09:50.920 --> 2:09:52.920]  But the political
[2:09:53.200 --> 2:09:58.280]  Islam is always battling to take over itself between Shiite and Sunni and it's very expansive
[2:09:58.280 --> 2:10:03.440]  So if you look at a map of the world before 1400 years ago, there was no Islam now
[2:10:04.840 --> 2:10:06.840]  Islam has taken over geographically
[2:10:07.840 --> 2:10:09.840]  more than a third of the planet and
[2:10:11.080 --> 2:10:17.160]  Population-wise is set to be 40% of the population and it's very expansionist now. I
[2:10:18.200 --> 2:10:21.960]  See the West run by these devil worshiping leftist who I see is the biggest threat
[2:10:21.960 --> 2:10:29.800]  And I see a lot of what Islam doing against that is actually a positive thing. So I would I see the left's alliance with Islam
[2:10:29.840 --> 2:10:37.000]  How they went and destabilized the Middle East put in the worst people to then have it explode into Europe for a coming collision
[2:10:37.000 --> 2:10:40.640]  I get that I want to stop that coming collision. I want to see a reformation in Islam
[2:10:40.640 --> 2:10:44.600]  I want to see a reparation in Christianity almost a reparation a reparation with Hollywood
[2:10:44.760 --> 2:10:50.100]  Everyone turning their backs on it completely because it literally is a giant snake full of poison
[2:10:50.100 --> 2:10:55.920]  And it's the most satanic thing ever seen on this planet. Okay, I don't agree with China putting two million Muslims in
[2:10:56.700 --> 2:11:00.920]  Forced labor camps, but China is a monotheistic, you know communist system
[2:11:01.420 --> 2:11:05.340]  And it sees another expansionist system as a threat. So it's just killing the poor folks
[2:11:05.860 --> 2:11:11.780]  The problem is in almost any Muslim culture. I wouldn't be accepted either. So I don't like communist China because it's authoritarian
[2:11:11.780 --> 2:11:13.820]  I don't like what Islam is right now. It's authoritarian and
[2:11:13.820 --> 2:11:20.860]  Islam is exploded like a bomb. Can I have a wireless mic, please? I'm gonna walk over here if I can in a minute
[2:11:20.860 --> 2:11:24.020]  I want to show people and then we'll show a map of the whole world
[2:11:24.340 --> 2:11:26.340]  Now that we've seen this map, but like a whole
[2:11:26.980 --> 2:11:28.980]  map of the planet laid out
[2:11:29.620 --> 2:11:32.980]  About where we were 1400 years ago
[2:11:34.460 --> 2:11:36.580]  Thanks, I guess nobody heard me about get bring me a mic
[2:11:36.580 --> 2:11:44.900]  Well, the boom operator will bring me a mic. So I appreciate that sir. You are awesome. You know what?
[2:11:44.900 --> 2:11:46.900]  I'll just do this next guy. They don't even hear me
[2:11:49.300 --> 2:11:54.360]  We don't need that anymore. Anyways, I'll do it over here. We'll do it next segment. Maybe next year. Who knows? Anyways
[2:11:56.220 --> 2:11:58.220]  Back I'm going off the air
[2:11:58.220 --> 2:12:11.740]  Whatever your opinion on Trump ordering the killing of Soleimani, I think we can all agree that the most cringe thing to come out of it
[2:12:11.740 --> 2:12:17.260]  Was the avalanche of normie tier World War three memes within minutes of the attack
[2:12:17.460 --> 2:12:25.860]  Thousands upon thousands of Twitter users who spend 90% of their time whining about gender pronouns suddenly became Middle Eastern geopolitical
[2:12:25.860 --> 2:12:31.580]  Experts say suddenly gave a shit about a man Soleimani who ten seconds previously
[2:12:31.580 --> 2:12:35.460]  They'd literally never heard of accompanying the relentless impassioned hysterical
[2:12:36.020 --> 2:12:43.740]  Dribble about the immediate onset of a new world war were a multitude of inane insipid memes World War three causes a worldwide nuclear
[2:12:43.860 --> 2:12:46.500]  Apocalypse me who say bottle caps for years
[2:12:48.060 --> 2:12:53.860]  Trump Siri play 99 love balloons by Nina Siri. Okay sending 99 atom bombs to Iran
[2:12:53.860 --> 2:12:58.020]  Germany realizing they are not guilty of this world war
[2:12:59.460 --> 2:13:02.100]  How snap maps be looking after the draft
[2:13:05.620 --> 2:13:13.140]  Not every act of military aggression means World War three is about to start just because Trump tweets insults at the Ayatollah or Kim
[2:13:13.140 --> 2:13:15.100]  Jong-un doesn't mean the next time you look out the window
[2:13:15.100 --> 2:13:22.460]  You're gonna see an apocalyptic wasteland where your local Walmart one stood but it wasn't just a meme the selective service website
[2:13:22.460 --> 2:13:29.620]  Actually crashed because the deluge of millennials were googling how to avoid the draft in the event of World War three in the US
[2:13:29.620 --> 2:13:31.620]  Although there hasn't been a draft since
[2:13:32.100 --> 2:13:36.700]  1973 all men ages 18 to 25 are required by law to provide basic
[2:13:36.820 --> 2:13:42.660]  Personal information to the selective service system not doing so is illegal the selective service
[2:13:42.660 --> 2:13:48.020]  Ben had to remind people that new legislation would have to be passed to reinstate the draft the US
[2:13:48.020 --> 2:13:51.940]  We are considering adding women to the draft me call me old-fashioned
[2:13:51.940 --> 2:13:54.660]  But yes, I was raised to serve my husband cook for him
[2:13:54.660 --> 2:14:00.460]  Do the laundry wake up at the crack of dawn to make him breakfast prepare his clothes and clean the house if world war three is coming
[2:14:00.460 --> 2:14:05.340]  Up and women want equal rights so bad. Maybe we should start drafting them to me and the girls
[2:14:05.500 --> 2:14:08.340]  See this is why we need to go to war Iran in
[2:14:08.980 --> 2:14:13.980]  1973 Iran in 2019 public library in Iran versus public library in USA
[2:14:13.980 --> 2:14:21.140]  But seriously how are people who have emotional breakdowns over pronouns not being respected going to behave if a world war
[2:14:21.140 --> 2:14:26.980]  Breaks out. I mean some of these idiots have near panic attacks when Twitter goes down for 10 minutes
[2:14:26.980 --> 2:14:33.380]  How are they gonna respond if an Iranian cyber attack takes down the entire internet for a few hours when grown men wet
[2:14:33.500 --> 2:14:35.860]  Themselves over a Millennium Falcon toy
[2:14:35.860 --> 2:14:41.060]  How are they gonna cope with the altogether different form of excitement of Chinese and Russian nukes
[2:14:41.540 --> 2:14:48.620]  Obliterating US cities another cringe fest was the site of people who've never even been near a war would never even dream of enlisting
[2:14:48.620 --> 2:14:55.820]  Getting all excited over war. Let's do to Tehran what we did to Dresden light it up and burn it down
[2:14:55.900 --> 2:14:57.900]  Let's make Tehran a memory
[2:14:58.900 --> 2:15:00.900]  You're out winning reality
[2:15:01.460 --> 2:15:03.980]  In there I kind of sprung it on the crew
[2:15:05.060 --> 2:15:07.060]  that I was going to
[2:15:07.380 --> 2:15:14.700]  Show a map of Islam's takeover then show a map of the world and show the expansion and then and then you heard the caller liberal
[2:15:14.700 --> 2:15:19.820]  Say that oh, you know, it's Christianity that's been expansive
[2:15:20.180 --> 2:15:24.740]  The crusades were a response when the Islam exploded like a bomb and took over most of the known world
[2:15:24.900 --> 2:15:31.980]  There was some pushback and now because of industrialization and expansion and populations expanding in the West and oil being discovered in the Middle
[2:15:31.980 --> 2:15:35.460]  East yes, that class has happened in the last hundred years
[2:15:36.340 --> 2:15:42.900]  But previously it was all Islamic expansion. So let's just be honest about that and that's all I'm saying
[2:15:42.900 --> 2:15:44.900]  But I appreciate liberal calling in
[2:15:45.300 --> 2:15:49.260]  We've got more of your calls with other chief lieutenant coming up. I don't know what I'm on today, man

[2:18:27.340 --> 2:18:33.620]  Which God wants to see you see we have to make the effort a hundred ten percent God will finish the move and I know
[2:18:33.620 --> 2:18:37.620]  I need to stay in the fight in the attack attack attack. I want to attack

[2:18:52.180 --> 2:18:54.180]  infowarstore.com

[2:18:59.460 --> 2:19:01.460]  I've tried turbo force with everything
[2:19:02.580 --> 2:19:06.860]  Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy. I put turbo force in my coffee. That was a crazy week
[2:19:06.860 --> 2:19:12.140]  I don't remember sleeping but as far as the products go turbo force is my favorite and all the info wars products are down to
[2:19:12.420 --> 2:19:14.420]  Taking control your life taking control your health
[2:19:14.420 --> 2:19:17.300]  Not relying on other people to do it for you
[2:19:18.460 --> 2:19:20.460]  nobody wakes up in the morning and
[2:19:21.300 --> 2:19:24.620]  Things I'm gonna give that person over there a better life. I'm gonna wake up today
[2:19:24.620 --> 2:19:29.380]  You know what? I'm gonna spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier happier and richer
[2:19:29.380 --> 2:19:33.980]  I'm gonna make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend. I don't think that happens very often. It's never happened to me
[2:19:33.980 --> 2:19:36.660]  I've never had anyone knock on my door and said Tate. You're such a good guy
[2:19:36.660 --> 2:19:41.300]  How can I improve your life in every single way? There's only one person who woke up and thought that and that was me
[2:19:41.300 --> 2:19:44.420]  I woke up and thought you know what? Okay. I want to take control of my life
[2:19:44.420 --> 2:19:48.700]  I want to take control of my health and that's why you need to go to info wars calm take control of your health right now and support the
[2:19:48.700 --> 2:19:54.380]  Resistance don't buy into the group think don't drink the Kool-Aid drink the turbo force Kool-Aid is bad and the turbo force is good
[2:19:54.380 --> 2:20:19.180]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:20:19.180 --> 2:20:21.380]  I don't want to go back to your calls, but I want to just briefly quantify
[2:20:21.380 --> 2:20:24.060]  Why I get so upset about Islam?
[2:20:25.380 --> 2:20:28.460]  1400 years ago Muhammad creates it
[2:20:28.980 --> 2:20:30.300]  By the time he's dead
[2:20:30.300 --> 2:20:36.060]  It's already taken over much of what Saudi Arabia today and then it starts taking over neighboring countries and it expands and
[2:20:36.620 --> 2:20:38.620]  Takes over most of the known world
[2:20:39.420 --> 2:20:43.980]  Except for areas of Western Europe and Asia within just a few hundred years
[2:20:43.980 --> 2:20:51.420]  And now it's got a population that's the fastest growing at 1.8 billion gonna be 3 billion in 10 years and
[2:20:52.140 --> 2:20:57.100]  It's unified and it's expansionist and so yes
[2:20:58.500 --> 2:21:03.940]  In the last hundred years the West is encroached on it because oil was discovered there and technology
[2:21:05.420 --> 2:21:08.100]  But you have the left and the globalist allied with
[2:21:08.100 --> 2:21:15.940]  Islam right now because it's anti-western and anti-christian, so I don't want to be at war with Muslims a lot of Muslims are very pious smart people
[2:21:17.220 --> 2:21:20.740]  But the the the political nature of it is so dangerous
[2:21:21.740 --> 2:21:23.740]  And we have the article up earlier
[2:21:24.300 --> 2:21:30.740]  Finally the New York Times is reporting on it. How is easy pinging persuaded one Muslim nation to keep silent on
[2:21:31.260 --> 2:21:36.220]  The concentration camps that hold two million Muslims in them where they work them to death and execute them
[2:21:36.220 --> 2:21:39.460]  There's videos and photos of that. It's not debatable
[2:21:40.460 --> 2:21:45.420]  But the average leftist says my resistance to the Islamification of our youth
[2:21:46.340 --> 2:21:48.820]  That that's bad and evil that I don't
[2:21:50.060 --> 2:21:57.380]  Like the no-go zones the grooming gangs and the worst aspects of Islam and how political correct people won't let anyone prosecute them
[2:21:59.180 --> 2:22:03.340]  For the honor killings the stonings the sexual mutilism all of it and
[2:22:03.340 --> 2:22:07.260]  And so it's the fact that it's above the law and protected
[2:22:07.260 --> 2:22:11.780]  I get there's another faction in the hegellian dialectic that wants war with it and then wants to have this big clash
[2:22:11.780 --> 2:22:13.780]  I don't want that either and I'm not in for those wars
[2:22:14.900 --> 2:22:16.900]  So that's where it stands
[2:22:17.620 --> 2:22:22.420]  And a much of Islam is basically a male thug grooming gang
[2:22:23.060 --> 2:22:28.660]  And I'm offended by it. I'm offended by a lot of the times I go to a restaurant
[2:22:28.660 --> 2:22:33.900]  I have my daughters are like, what is this? There's women with full hoods on eating food under it
[2:22:33.900 --> 2:22:39.820]  And the men are looking at his weird man, and it's it's it's it's I don't like it. I'll be point blank with you
[2:22:39.820 --> 2:22:43.420]  Yeah, I I believe Western civilization is superior. I
[2:22:44.140 --> 2:22:50.540]  Don't like putting hoods over women's heads and and and burning them or drowning them in the swimming pool or stoning them to death
[2:22:50.540 --> 2:22:56.660]  You know if my wife and daughters didn't do what I said does that mean I like extreme crazy feminism with Jezebel spirit and the women all
[2:22:56.660 --> 2:23:02.220]  And then trying to dominate men. No women aren't happy doing that either and you know how you don't deal with that
[2:23:02.580 --> 2:23:07.420]  You act like a man and tell him you're not putting up with that crap, but it doesn't mean you put hoods over their heads
[2:23:09.820 --> 2:23:11.820]  Let's see the left loves that
[2:23:15.220 --> 2:23:21.740]  Yeah, I mean I had to watch this in Austin restaurants literally this I mean, it's cut give me a break. Okay
[2:23:21.740 --> 2:23:28.420]  I'm done people go. Oh, you need to be tolerant tolerant means I I
[2:23:29.460 --> 2:23:35.660]  Didn't get up and leave the restaurant didn't tell him stop it. I've got my free speech tolerant doesn't mean I've been over and taking I
[2:23:37.460 --> 2:23:38.900]  Said I'd calmly talk about it
[2:23:38.900 --> 2:23:41.860]  But see that what I'm doing there what the fed the women be free is bad
[2:23:42.380 --> 2:23:48.460]  Putting them in camps is okay because it's a Chinese person that Chinese aren't white so they can't do anything wrong
[2:23:48.460 --> 2:23:50.460]  Oh
[2:23:57.740 --> 2:24:00.220]  All right, let's get serious here, let's go some phone calls
[2:24:01.780 --> 2:24:04.620]  My kids Chicago you're on the air
[2:24:06.940 --> 2:24:08.940]  Alex yes, sir
[2:24:09.100 --> 2:24:14.140]  Happy New Year. Happy New Year to you my friend. Thank you for holding. Thank you for calling us. Thank you for caring
[2:24:14.140 --> 2:24:16.140]  I
[2:24:16.860 --> 2:24:21.940]  Just want to pass something by I had this idea over the holidays
[2:24:22.780 --> 2:24:25.340]  meeting with all my Italian relatives and
[2:24:26.020 --> 2:24:28.700]  Most of them don't know about you and I told them all about you
[2:24:29.780 --> 2:24:33.340]  And I came up with an idea called 20 for 2020
[2:24:34.420 --> 2:24:37.540]  that every one of your listeners donate $20 and
[2:24:37.540 --> 2:24:43.820]  I know you have about a million listeners a week. Yes, and
[2:24:45.500 --> 2:24:48.460]  Start out by you taking $20 out of your will hug right now
[2:24:49.340 --> 2:24:53.940]  Have all your crew and let's see how fast we can get a million people to donate
[2:24:54.500 --> 2:24:59.580]  Well, I could hire like 20 more reporters and literally totally change the 2020 election
[2:24:59.580 --> 2:25:02.940]  Just dominate the talking points if we had a lot more money
[2:25:02.940 --> 2:25:07.300]  And I think we should launch some fundraisers in that way
[2:25:07.300 --> 2:25:11.980]  We just judiciously plug those but then have less plugging for the products
[2:25:11.980 --> 2:25:15.980]  And so that's actually my plan and we're working on some of that infrastructure right now
[2:25:17.940 --> 2:25:20.460]  The dollars a year on your product they're incredible
[2:25:21.540 --> 2:25:26.100]  But if you can't come up with $20 out of your pocket a gift card
[2:25:26.980 --> 2:25:28.380]  credit card
[2:25:28.380 --> 2:25:35.180]  You have a PO box with $20 on an envelope and mail it today. I bet you could do this by the end of January
[2:25:35.620 --> 2:25:37.300]  It's a great idea. We should do it
[2:25:37.300 --> 2:25:42.500]  But you and I pretty sure might want to support but let's let's let's get to what you think those folks want to hear that
[2:25:42.500 --> 2:25:44.500]  What do you think about the Iran situation?
[2:25:45.580 --> 2:25:49.300]  Well, I was very disturbed seeing the president this morning. I
[2:25:49.860 --> 2:25:53.220]  never saw president look more like he had a gun pointed to his head and
[2:25:53.220 --> 2:26:00.220]  And there's something very wrong going on with this whole thing, you know, that's not the president Trump
[2:26:00.220 --> 2:26:02.740]  I know I mean his cheeks were bright red
[2:26:03.420 --> 2:26:08.020]  You look very distressed, you know, I wasn't gonna say that but when I watched it
[2:26:08.340 --> 2:26:12.620]  He did he did stumble over stuff more than he ever has and he didn't look comfortable
[2:26:12.620 --> 2:26:15.900]  Maybe we should roll some b-roll of that and you know, that's about him
[2:26:15.900 --> 2:26:20.580]  He's flawless without a teleprompter and he kept misspeaking today
[2:26:20.580 --> 2:26:24.860]  And the look on those generals behind them was pretty scary. So
[2:26:25.700 --> 2:26:31.740]  There's there's definitely something pretty evil going on like you like usual in Washington. I
[2:26:33.060 --> 2:26:36.940]  Hear a brother. God bless you, Mike. We love you. All right, let's go to the next caller
[2:26:37.100 --> 2:26:43.220]  Let's talk to pastor Sam old regular caller who we love pastor Sam. What's your view on all this my friend?
[2:26:44.540 --> 2:26:47.820]  after your expose with Tom Papper yesterday of
[2:26:47.820 --> 2:26:55.060]  Mike Pompeo, I could not stand to look at his face this morning even for five seconds as the camera
[2:26:55.060 --> 2:26:58.040]  Panned past him and zoomed in on the president. I
[2:26:59.460 --> 2:27:04.300]  Have given him the benefit of the doubt because I respect the president's appointment
[2:27:04.300 --> 2:27:07.180]  And I respect the office and I respect the rank
[2:27:07.580 --> 2:27:15.020]  But dang it I travel the world and I expect the US Embassy to be there to help me as an American and
[2:27:15.020 --> 2:27:21.900]  And the Marines there to defend me as an American and to put their guns in the face of whatever cartel
[2:27:22.260 --> 2:27:28.580]  Has has threatened me and I thank God that the Marines are there to do that underneath of that American flag
[2:27:28.580 --> 2:27:31.340]  But the State Department has been working against us
[2:27:31.340 --> 2:27:38.020]  It's where a lot of the swamp lives and he looks so much like Milton Bearden in his mannerisms of late
[2:27:38.020 --> 2:27:44.940]  And I know the State Department is the center of the swamp. It's the deepest most stinking hole and
[2:27:45.380 --> 2:27:51.740]  It's got to stop. Hey one more thing your feet is going live right now on the true channel
[2:27:51.940 --> 2:27:53.700]  calm the new
[2:27:53.700 --> 2:27:54.940]  Spanish
[2:27:54.940 --> 2:27:56.940]  Conservative Trump supporting
[2:27:56.940 --> 2:28:01.940]  Worldwide network out of Miami, Florida. This call is going out live. I love it
[2:28:01.940 --> 2:28:04.140]  Why don't you plug it? Why don't you plug it like five times?
[2:28:04.140 --> 2:28:09.900]  How they find the true channel calm on Facebook the true news network
[2:28:09.900 --> 2:28:17.540]  So you have to put the in front of them the true channel calm or on Facebook the true news network
[2:28:17.540 --> 2:28:23.040]  And this feed is going out live. We're gonna move immediately into Spanish language
[2:28:23.260 --> 2:28:28.340]  Commentary on the president's speech as we have been doing day by day also on my
[2:28:30.820 --> 2:28:32.820]  The true channel calm
[2:28:32.820 --> 2:28:34.820]  We love your brother
[2:28:34.820 --> 2:28:36.820]  Hey, hey one more
[2:28:36.820 --> 2:28:40.140]  Give me your number cuz I know you're you're the pastor same and calm from years
[2:28:40.740 --> 2:28:44.260]  Give me your name. Aren't you like also a missionary going to Mexico a lot, right?
[2:28:44.860 --> 2:28:46.860]  That's right
[2:28:46.860 --> 2:28:50.460]  I'm gonna get you on as an official. I'm gonna get you on as an official guest
[2:28:51.140 --> 2:28:53.140]  Talk about what you're doing. So we'll set that up right now
[2:28:53.660 --> 2:28:59.660]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners if you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system
[2:28:59.660 --> 2:29:04.140]  But we're waiting for prices too crazy to pass up. This will be the most important message
[2:29:04.140 --> 2:29:05.420]  You'll ever hear bill hide here
[2:29:05.420 --> 2:29:10.420]  I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system
[2:29:10.420 --> 2:29:16.900]  That's gonna let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid the clearance price is a result of the historic flooding
[2:29:16.900 --> 2:29:20.420]  We're having here right on the east bank of the Mississippi because of the flooding
[2:29:20.420 --> 2:29:25.540]  We've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location and rather than move it back to the warehouse
[2:29:25.540 --> 2:29:31.540]  We thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwaters back story
[2:29:31.540 --> 2:29:37.020]  So here's what you should do right now. Check out the PPX microgrid system at my own power grid com
[2:29:37.020 --> 2:29:44.140]  That's my own power grid com over a thousand dollars in great off-the-grid gear and a ton of bonuses too and the best part
[2:29:44.140 --> 2:29:52.740]  You're not gonna pay 750 or $500 300 or even 200 go to my own power grid com to learn more. That's my own power grid com
[2:29:52.740 --> 2:30:01.940]  So what's the most important part? Let's say in a bulldozer running over the globalist the treads the wheels the engine the scoop on the front
[2:30:01.940 --> 2:30:05.620]  It's all very important, but the fuel is paramount and that's my allegor
[2:30:06.540 --> 2:30:14.980]  Paraboforce is vitamins minerals amino acids that synergistically work with six different natural forms of healthy clean energy that lasts for 10 hours
[2:30:14.980 --> 2:30:20.060]  In the average metabolic system metabolism of a human some people get 15 hours out of some people get about eight hours
[2:30:20.060 --> 2:30:25.380]  But people take this people taking sports people cannot believe it's the best they've ever had because it's not high
[2:30:25.620 --> 2:30:27.940]  Nobody puts as much product into
[2:30:28.420 --> 2:30:31.580]  Their pre workouts their pros workouts you can call us whatever you want
[2:30:31.580 --> 2:30:34.700]  It's it's a it's a total solution all around the best you're gonna find
[2:30:34.700 --> 2:30:39.420]  Paraboforce without you we don't roll with you we search forward together
[2:30:39.420 --> 2:30:43.220]  It's like the bulldozer without the diesel fuel if we don't have your financial support
[2:30:43.220 --> 2:30:47.340]  We will be defeated you support us to get products you already need that literally fuel your body your mind
[2:30:47.340 --> 2:30:53.380]  It's a win-win 360 together info or store.com or triple a two five three three one three nine
[2:30:53.380 --> 2:30:54.540]  I
[2:30:54.540 --> 2:30:58.740]  Would thank you for everything you've done for the info war, but I know you're like me
[2:30:58.740 --> 2:31:00.380]  You don't want my thanks
[2:31:00.380 --> 2:31:06.700]  You want victory over the globalist and these devil worship and child molesters and you want them off your back and off your children's back
[2:31:06.700 --> 2:31:10.540]  And you know what I'm the same way, and that's why we're on the same damn team
[2:31:10.780 --> 2:31:15.440]  And it's why in fours has been delivering time and time again when it's clutch time
[2:31:15.440 --> 2:31:17.440]  to
[2:31:17.680 --> 2:31:22.000]  Focus the people on taking action against the globalist because I'm committed to a future
[2:31:22.640 --> 2:31:25.280]  For humanity, and I know you are as well
[2:31:25.560 --> 2:31:29.480]  So thank you in 2019 for standing with us because you are the info war
[2:31:29.480 --> 2:31:35.920]  And I want to thank you for committing to stand with us in 2020 however you can for bottom my heart from my family
[2:31:35.920 --> 2:31:37.240]  And from the great crew at info wars
[2:31:37.240 --> 2:31:42.760]  I want to thank you all because you are the info war, and you know, that's not just words. That's reality
[2:31:42.760 --> 2:31:46.360]  You have made history. We have made history together
[2:31:47.160 --> 2:31:53.680]  Info wars comm only has power because of you, and I suggest you use it
[2:31:53.960 --> 2:31:58.920]  If you understand why the globalist why the servants of Satan hate info wars
[2:31:58.920 --> 2:32:05.160]  It's because we're awake. We're alive. We're passionate, and we're not giving up
[2:32:05.760 --> 2:32:10.200]  That's why it's critical for those of us that are aware of the new order's plans
[2:32:10.200 --> 2:32:14.960]  To not get down when they attack us, and they persecute us, and they lie about us
[2:32:15.280 --> 2:32:19.680]  That's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags
[2:32:19.800 --> 2:32:25.440]  The globalists have literally sold their soul to the dark side and they do what they do because they're slaves
[2:32:25.840 --> 2:32:31.240]  Because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent
[2:32:31.240 --> 2:32:35.520]  It is up to us who are awake not the sheep and not the wolves
[2:32:35.520 --> 2:32:41.200]  But the sheep dogs to stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants
[2:32:41.200 --> 2:32:46.200]  They fear the fact that we are awake. They fear the fact that we are alive
[2:32:46.520 --> 2:32:53.320]  They fear the fact that we love God, and that's all we ever have to know is that God is in charge
[2:32:53.320 --> 2:33:02.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:33:05.200 --> 2:33:13.720]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:33:13.720 --> 2:33:27.720]  Well President Trump doesn't like who already says that he killed the top Iranian general and others last Thursday to stop a war
[2:33:28.320 --> 2:33:35.280]  Well now today after the Iranians fired missiles at a U.S. Air Force base in Iraq. We've seen Trump call for
[2:33:36.040 --> 2:33:38.040]  Dayton and we've seen a
[2:33:38.040 --> 2:33:42.320]  Call for de-escalation. I hope that's the case with Iran
[2:33:42.320 --> 2:33:50.040]  But the bigger question is why did this happen now with a few days of hindsight is Dr. Steve Pachennick has a lot of sources and contacts in the Pentagon and the government
[2:33:50.040 --> 2:33:57.040]  And I'm sure has had a chance to poke around and find out really the wider picture. Is it true that there was a bigger war coming?
[2:33:57.040 --> 2:34:00.040]  What was that war going to be? What were the Iranians up to?
[2:34:00.040 --> 2:34:05.040]  Was Trump giving good intelligence because I know Dr. Pachennick came on this show when he was a big monkey
[2:34:05.040 --> 2:34:12.040]  He muck at the CFR and Tom Clancy's main co-writer and a big Hollywood producer and said the government was involved
[2:34:12.040 --> 2:34:15.040]  We're not saying radical Islam doesn't exist. We're saying 9-11
[2:34:15.040 --> 2:34:18.040]  Clearly had a large component of a stand down and a lot more
[2:34:18.040 --> 2:34:21.040]  And he talked about bin Laden being on ice and dying from marfan disease
[2:34:21.040 --> 2:34:23.040]  So and he's come out against a bunch of these other wars
[2:34:23.040 --> 2:34:27.040]  So I mean I trust him to really give us his take on whether this was a good thing or not
[2:34:27.040 --> 2:34:29.040]  And when we had him on last week, he was saying well
[2:34:29.040 --> 2:34:34.040]  First synopsis is yeah, I would have done it as dramatically. This is going to stir up the Iranians
[2:34:34.040 --> 2:34:40.040]  But now with 6 days hindsight, 7 days hindsight, which is a century these days
[2:34:40.040 --> 2:34:45.040]  We'll get the unvarnished, unfiltered view from Dr. Steve Pachennick, StevePachennick.com
[2:34:45.040 --> 2:34:48.040]  A lot of great news and videos on that site. People should bookmark it
[2:34:48.040 --> 2:34:52.040]  So what is your current view on what's happening right now?
[2:34:52.040 --> 2:34:56.040]  And the president did give a good speech and what he said today
[2:34:56.040 --> 2:35:01.040]  I like trying to dial things back and saying NATO should do more and the U.S. shouldn't pay for it
[2:35:01.040 --> 2:35:04.040]  But he did stumble a lot and look like he had a gun to his head
[2:35:05.040 --> 2:35:12.040]  Not really with all due respect. The president really likes to talk off the cuff so to speak
[2:35:12.040 --> 2:35:18.040]  Or ex-cathedra, let's not be too fancy. The truth of the matter is he did exactly what I said last week
[2:35:18.040 --> 2:35:23.040]  It was a surgical strike. He did it for the right reasons
[2:35:23.040 --> 2:35:31.040]  When I said last week that in fact the New York Times and the media was not correctly covering the issues in Iraq
[2:35:31.040 --> 2:35:42.040]  It was a real problem because the Shiite students and the Sunni students were really protesting against the Shiite-dominated government
[2:35:42.040 --> 2:35:50.040]  Which was totally, totally corrupt and Baghdad. And that in turn was run by Soleimani and his henchmen
[2:35:50.040 --> 2:35:58.040]  Soleimani has corrupted so many elements of the proxy war that Trump is correct. He does not want war
[2:35:58.040 --> 2:36:03.040]  I correctly said that Ayatollah Khomeini and Khomeini do not want war
[2:36:03.040 --> 2:36:09.040]  Ayatollah Khomeini is 80-some years old. He's got bigger, bigger problems than the United States
[2:36:09.040 --> 2:36:16.040]  He just had an earthquake 30 miles outside of one of his major nuclear reactors which may fall apart
[2:36:16.040 --> 2:36:23.040]  He's lost 26,000 people in the earthquake. He's lost 176 people in a Ukrainian flight
[2:36:23.040 --> 2:36:28.040]  And more importantly, he has an economy that's going down very rapidly
[2:36:28.040 --> 2:36:34.040]  So what Trump did was a one-off, which is exactly what I do and my military guys do
[2:36:34.040 --> 2:36:41.040]  We do surgical strikes, we take out an individual, we take out a country and then we come back and negotiate
[2:36:41.040 --> 2:36:47.040]  This was true about all of the people that I dealt with, whether it was in Panama, Italy or Cambodia
[2:36:47.040 --> 2:36:52.040]  And then we turn around and I negotiate a treaty. That's what Trump will do
[2:36:52.040 --> 2:37:00.040]  Anything other than that, I don't think will occur. And I think that, again, the Democrats were so far behind the ball
[2:37:00.040 --> 2:37:08.040]  They had no idea what's going on. At the same time, Pelosi will get none of anything of the request that she wants
[2:37:08.040 --> 2:37:15.040]  And number two, McConnell will continue to do an impeachment scenario, which is a kabuki
[2:37:15.040 --> 2:37:22.040]  But basically, we're at a point of peace. The stock market said it, I said it, oil went up for a little bit
[2:37:22.040 --> 2:37:26.040]  Then came down and I said we're a net exporter of oil
[2:37:26.040 --> 2:37:35.040]  And we are so rich in oil and crude oil and sweet oil that we can overcome anything that goes on in the world in terms of oil
[2:37:35.040 --> 2:37:47.040]  Iran now is in desperate economic shape. She can no longer tolerate the economic abuse that has occurred because of the IRG and Soleimani
[2:37:47.040 --> 2:37:54.040]  And you've got 40% of millions of the kids there who are under the age of 30. That's what they were protesting
[2:37:54.040 --> 2:37:58.040]  And Soleimani was ruthless. He had killed many of these students
[2:37:58.040 --> 2:38:05.040]  And despite the fact that there was a appearance of a million mourners, not, I don't think they were all mourners
[2:38:05.040 --> 2:38:11.040]  They just had to come out and support the Ayatollah because it is an authoritarian regime
[2:38:11.040 --> 2:38:18.040]  We basically effectively done what Trump wanted. Do we have a strategy yet?
[2:38:18.040 --> 2:38:28.040]  The strategy is simple. Trump will act when he needs to act. And other than that, we don't need all these fancy baloney strategic papers
[2:38:28.040 --> 2:38:36.040]  That were always required by DOD or the NSC or the State Department. It's a new era. We have a businessman there
[2:38:36.040 --> 2:38:44.040]  Stop right there and explain how normally it's these committees that decide policy and then that basically means responses are super slow
[2:38:44.040 --> 2:38:49.040]  So there's no real politics going on because you did say all this last week right after it happened
[2:38:49.040 --> 2:38:56.040]  You predicted that it would basically cause what's now happening and I think it was somewhat of a gamble for Trump
[2:38:56.040 --> 2:39:03.040]  But so far it's worked. I think the danger also is that now neocons and others will try to trick him into more adventurism
[2:39:03.040 --> 2:39:09.040]  I think he's smart enough not to do it but right. Soleimani was expanding the networks. There were some internal fights with him
[2:39:09.040 --> 2:39:14.040]  And the rest, the Iranian power structures, they really won't be too upset that he's gone in a lot of ways
[2:39:14.040 --> 2:39:19.040]  He was getting too powerful. You're right. He was starting to project power into Iraq and if we're going to pull back
[2:39:19.040 --> 2:39:27.040]  Well, we can't leave that vacuum for them to then come in. And so I think the calculus you brought up is what the president thought
[2:39:27.040 --> 2:39:35.040]  What he was shown. You hadn't talked to a lot of folks today. It happened. Now, six days later, is that from other folks you're talking to?
[2:39:35.040 --> 2:39:44.040]  Basically the consensus that you're getting? Well, when I came on your show, quite frankly, my colleagues in intelligence, I won't specify
[2:39:44.040 --> 2:39:54.040]  All agreed with what I had to say. And they're in agreement. The reason they took out and they worked so quickly to take out the specific individual
[2:39:54.040 --> 2:40:06.040]  It was a one off because he literally is the head of a terrorist organization and what was described by Trump was that the Al Qaeda that they
[2:40:06.040 --> 2:40:25.040]  And the IRG are terrorists. They work as proxy warriors in Lebanon, in Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and in Iran. Basically, you have to understand, I said a long time ago, Iranian people themselves do not want to go out and fight
[2:40:25.040 --> 2:40:37.040]  So Soleimani understood this in order to acquire the power that he had to have in order to compete with Ayatollah Hameini. Remember, they're potential antagonists.
[2:40:37.040 --> 2:40:47.040]  They weren't allies. All irrespective of the fact that Hameini cried. Those were crocodile tears because I knew his father and I knew about Hameini
[2:40:47.040 --> 2:41:00.040]  And I knew that there was a power struggle going on at the senior levels as did my own people. But when I reaffirmed it that that basically taking out Soleimani made Hameini more amenable to any
[2:41:00.040 --> 2:41:13.040]  Any prescriptions we might give them in terms of what type of peace we would want. Now, the notion that one man can make that decision without having to go through Congress without having to go to the NSC and
[2:41:13.040 --> 2:41:31.040]  GOD is viable when you have a man like Trump who's acquired the ability to make decisions quickly, intuitively and doesn't back off. Unlike Bush and Cheney who went through this whole kabuki of being nice and totally hypocritical
[2:41:31.040 --> 2:41:44.040]  We had complete liars and we had an intelligence system plus the FBI and the CIA who polluted with them in order to create a war that was based on false intelligence. You have the converse of this.
[2:41:44.040 --> 2:41:57.040]  You have a man who relies on his intelligence, relies on his military. The military told him exactly what we were saying. You take one off. This is what you need to do. You don't need to go after the militias.
[2:41:57.040 --> 2:42:11.040]  You don't have to go after Hisbola because remember a week ago I said to you and our people that Hisbola was in trouble because in Lebanon, Ferrari and the Shiites were being taken out.
[2:42:11.040 --> 2:42:25.040]  We got to go to break and I want our listeners to understand something. I'm not here trying to sell people on war. I'm not here. I'm not here with an agenda other than freedom. People need to know why the president did what he did and folks are really getting from a real expert.
[2:42:25.040 --> 2:42:35.040]  The thinking that went into it, whether you agree with it or not, we're just getting the public to think about processes and different ways of doing things. Instead of invading, you just kill the bad guy.
[2:42:35.040 --> 2:42:46.040]  You can debate whether he was bad or not. The truth is he was getting more powerful. His militias were expanding. The Ayatollah was threatened by him and that's why I thought that level there might have been a back channel with Trump to kill this guy with the back channel.
[2:42:46.040 --> 2:42:53.040]  I almost started the show with that today to say I think there was a back channel between the Ayatollah and Trump. Turns out there was. It's in the news right now.
[2:42:53.040 --> 2:43:05.040]  Knock on wood. I am not tempting fate. But everybody around the office, especially folks that have worked there a long time, have noticed that I really don't ever get sick.
[2:43:05.040 --> 2:43:14.040]  Now, again, I might get sick tomorrow because I just made that statement. I'm not tempting fate. I'll say that again because I am superstitious when it comes down to that.
[2:43:14.040 --> 2:43:28.040]  I'm very thankful for the good Lord, for the Constitution I've been given. But up until about eight, nine years ago when I started taking X2 in the product's enforced life, I still got sick every couple of years.
[2:43:28.040 --> 2:43:43.040]  And, you know, I still get sore throats from allergies and pollen and things like that. But now that I religiously take the products and enforce life with the highest quality stuff, most you're going to find out there, I just never get a fever anymore.
[2:43:43.040 --> 2:43:53.040]  It's probably been three, four years since I've had a fever. It's just crazy. So I chalk it up to genetics and the great products.
[2:44:14.040 --> 2:44:23.040]  Millions of people around the world experience daytime drowsiness, but with the rapid speed of life, we need to be able to keep up the pace.

[2:45:15.040 --> 2:45:21.040]  And we're already so close to selling out all these products that I'm just going to go ahead and keep the sale going for two more days.
[2:45:21.040 --> 2:45:29.040]  And we're going to basically sell out of all of our major product lines. It'll take weeks, months for them all to come back in.
[2:45:29.040 --> 2:45:33.040]  Some come in in weeks, some come in in like three months. A lot of stuff's coming back in next week.
[2:45:33.040 --> 2:45:42.040]  So I've just decided because of the inventory issues and all the rest of it, and because some of these we're selling at losses or making people buy a lot of other stuff and we are making a profit.
[2:45:42.040 --> 2:45:49.040]  So I'm going to just keep the sale going, but only for 48 hours maximum. Then we've got to stop it. InfoWarsStore.com.
[2:45:49.040 --> 2:45:54.040]  Year end, now 2020 mega blowout sale. InfoWarsStore.com. Biggest sales we're ever going to have.
[2:45:54.040 --> 2:46:00.040]  InfoWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine. Introducing pollen block.
[2:46:00.040 --> 2:46:11.040]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[2:46:11.040 --> 2:46:20.040]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[2:46:20.040 --> 2:46:31.040]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[2:46:31.040 --> 2:46:46.040]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine. In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[2:46:46.040 --> 2:46:57.040]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe. Head to InfoWarsLife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[2:46:57.040 --> 2:47:02.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:47:28.040 --> 2:47:42.040]  I'm going to get to everybody holding Matt, David, Jefferson, Carl, Dave, Eric, and a few others, but we're going to move quick because I've been moving slow on the call today.
[2:47:42.040 --> 2:47:50.040]  Didn't do as good a job as I've been doing the last few days, but got the war room coming up and they take calls as well with Owen Shroyer.
[2:47:50.040 --> 2:48:00.040]  Pulling back from this, just looking at it from what's really happening and what Trump did. You've got Putin running down to Syria, now Putin is meeting with Erdogan.
[2:48:00.040 --> 2:48:05.040]  You have Iran, hopefully, pulling back.
[2:48:05.040 --> 2:48:16.040]  I mean, this, if it succeeds, we could probably say is a success for America and for President Trump, which I hope it is. Obviously, we all have mixed feelings about it, but it is where it is.
[2:48:16.040 --> 2:48:23.040]  But what about the letter? We had the Iraqi president last week saying, hey, the US is pulling out. I've talked to Trump. I've talked to their people.
[2:48:23.040 --> 2:48:30.040]  Is that true or not? Then this letter leaks out. This Defense Department letter that says they're pulling out, but wasn't official, but they admit was a real letter.
[2:48:30.040 --> 2:48:35.040]  There's obviously a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes. Do you have any information on that, Dr?
[2:48:35.040 --> 2:48:47.040]  Well, the key thing to remember is what I've been saying for years, and this is still true and it came about. I said, number one, Putin will take over the Middle East with our agreement.
[2:48:47.040 --> 2:49:04.040]  This is what we have said for years. And Trump agrees with that. The reason we have Putin taking over, going into Syria, going into Lebanon, going into the various areas to negotiate a peace is that we need a new actor who is a close ally of the United States.
[2:49:04.040 --> 2:49:17.040]  Contrary to what the neocons say or anybody else, Russia is not our enemy. It's our closest ally. Secondly, I said Erdogan will be the predominant Sunni power in the Middle East.
[2:49:17.040 --> 2:49:32.040]  And he is. He has gone into Libya, which was, remember, that was the biggest mistake by Hillary Clinton and Obama and made a disaster, killing thousands and thousands of people, destroying a country.
[2:49:32.040 --> 2:49:49.040]  And now Erdogan has to go in and serve as our surrogate. Number three, I predict Iran will come back as an ally. It will make deals with us, economic deals in particular, to diversify its economy away from oil, which we can do.
[2:49:49.040 --> 2:50:03.040]  And Trump clearly said it is a great country, which I've said I've visited it. I worked with Khomeini. I've worked with a lot of the Iranians and they want to build up a country where 40 percent of the people are kids.
[2:50:03.040 --> 2:50:11.040]  So all three elements strategically are working together. This was predictable years ago. Why is it there?
[2:50:11.040 --> 2:50:27.040]  What you're seeing analysis is that Soleimani was basically on a power trip expansionist. He already almost ran Iran. And at a gut level, I kind of felt like that the Ayatollah might have been somehow greenlighting that they weren't really going to do much if Soleimani went out because they were rivals of each other.
[2:50:27.040 --> 2:50:32.040]  And I bet they warned the U.S. they were firing the missiles. Well, that's now been confirmed today.
[2:50:32.040 --> 2:50:44.040]  The Iranian government's come out and said that basically this whole thing was Kabuki. Thank God our missiles shot those down because we had folks in the shots of the missiles that hit on the base and outside the base.
[2:50:44.040 --> 2:51:02.040]  Your audience has to understand one thing. We don't just have missiles coming in strategically. We have missiles 24 seven by the CIA above Iran. That has been there for years. And the Iranians knew it.
[2:51:02.040 --> 2:51:16.040]  What we did was to take the end Q nine Reaper missile and travel a thousand five hundred miles, 50,000 feet and bring it down. But the Iranians knew we have had missiles and we have grown up there for years.
[2:51:16.040 --> 2:51:30.040]  So that's not the unusual part. The unusual part is that they didn't believe that Soleimani would be taking that with his assistant. Now Trump has basically said, this is my foreign policy. We're going to get out of the Middle East.
[2:51:30.040 --> 2:51:44.040]  But let's go back. Do you think there's a back channel not with Kerry and Obama and all those people to the I totals anywhere? We know they were working with Soleimani. Do you think the I tola at some level it was telegraph that we were going to kill Soleimani?
[2:51:44.040 --> 2:52:04.040]  I think he had. Let me put it this way in order not to embarrass him or his father. They're very smart. They had an unusual understanding that Soleimani was a problem. I've said it for a long time. He was a self aggrandizing boy who was a peasant came up through the I RG had an independent power base away from
[2:52:04.040 --> 2:52:22.040]  from Ayatollah Hameini. He walked around Baghdad. He wasn't hidden. He was taking pictures. He was taking selfies of himself and other things. And basically he was the element that made Iran a deadly force overseas through proxies.
[2:52:22.040 --> 2:52:32.040]  Iranians themselves did not want to go to war. So basically you're saying Iran's been defanged ahead of an offer and a deal to try to bring them back into the League of Nations.
[2:52:32.040 --> 2:52:40.040]  And they will come back into the League of Nations and NATO will help out. France will help out. Britain will help out. Russia will help out.
[2:52:40.040 --> 2:52:48.040]  And that's a change in policy because it's not the neocon destabilization policy. It's a really what you call kind of an Eisenhower in type stabilization policy.
[2:52:48.040 --> 2:53:07.040]  Well, I would say Eisenhower, but George Marshall was the real genius of our wars and strategy, not only in war, but also as a secretary of state. And he was a brilliant, brilliant man. So this is a man like Marshall, who may not have the same education
[2:53:07.040 --> 2:53:20.040]  and military background, but I assure you, as a businessman, you do not create all the businesses he does without making a key decision at his at his at his point.
[2:53:20.040 --> 2:53:32.040]  Remember, the government is not geared for this type of individual. We don't have the ability to make momentary decisions other than in the military and other other than a military intelligence.
[2:53:32.040 --> 2:53:39.040]  So is is is acting as the president. And I agree with you. I was just having fun with it. He did look uncomfortable because as you said, he doesn't like to read off teleprompters.
[2:53:39.040 --> 2:53:52.040]  And so that's why he looked more like this. Yeah, he doesn't like that. But you had you had Mike Mark Esper and you had Pompeo. Both guys went to West Point and then we're in the same class as much as I've
[2:53:52.040 --> 2:54:02.040]  got. And he's a great size. Pompeo. He did an excellent job. Let me write this last point because we're almost out of time. I appreciate your time. Steve Pachennick.com is a website. Pompeo is still over the State Department.
[2:54:02.040 --> 2:54:13.040]  And he brought in those Obama people we just found out to continue the counter and disinformation propaganda CIA operation of fake news in Europe aimed at me and even other Liberty sites are doing nothing wrong.
[2:54:13.040 --> 2:54:25.040]  They're doing those certifications to get a shut down in business. And I and Pompeo is either a moron or he just keep all those Soros jerks in there so they can do stuff to me because I'm personally sick of this.
[2:54:25.040 --> 2:54:36.040]  I understand that Pompeo will probably be encouraged to run as the senator for Kansas because we need a controlling vote there. Pompeo has a limited point of time.
[2:54:36.040 --> 2:54:42.040]  What about getting rid of the Obama Soros people in the State Department that are still running fake news against everybody.
[2:54:42.040 --> 2:54:50.040]  I agree with it. But I got you know if you put me in there I will guarantee you I could get rid of seventy three thousand out of seventy four.
[2:54:50.040 --> 2:54:58.040]  Trump can't figure out who's who he just needs to fire the hell out of people. Yeah you got to just fire them. I don't need seventy four thousand people in the State Department.
[2:54:58.040 --> 2:55:08.040]  I don't even know what they want. But we've been studying some of these guys and they literally just former CNN people and stuff have their own little empires in there just doing whatever they want.
[2:55:08.040 --> 2:55:18.040]  Again remember what I said to you. We need somebody in the White House who's tough enough to get rid of people in the intelligence system. Sixteen different units in the State Department.
[2:55:18.040 --> 2:55:30.040]  We can start with people that undermine the president and bad. These people are running stuff against the president. I can track who they are what they're doing. And Pompeo is sitting on top of them like a bunch of baby birds or something.
[2:55:30.040 --> 2:55:39.040]  Remember the big chicken with them underneath him. Sorry. No but Alex we got one problem and that's going to be John Bolton and the warning goes out to Bolton.
[2:55:39.040 --> 2:55:48.040]  If you do anything to harm the president there are a lot of us who understand what Bolton's about. I'm not making a threat. Let me just say this.
[2:55:48.040 --> 2:55:54.040]  I was about to bring Bolton up. Now he's going to testify against the president. They think he's going to be the secret guy that provides the fake testimony.
[2:55:54.040 --> 2:56:06.040]  So what is your message to Bolton? A message to Bolton is be careful. When the gods accrue they will grant what you want and you will be in the process of self destruction.
[2:56:06.040 --> 2:56:22.040]  You've been in that process for a long time. You've lied. You deceived and you manipulated your way up. It's not going to happen with Trump and it's not going to happen with Richard Armitage or Carl Ford or a bunch of us who come out of military intelligence
[2:56:22.040 --> 2:56:38.040]  and other intelligence units. And so the warning is out there Bolton that if anything happens to this president or you deceive him in any way my suggestion is you go back overseas and go on a holiday because this will not occur and we will not
[2:56:38.040 --> 2:56:54.040]  tolerate any abuse to the president and there are many of us who know Bolton and Bolton understands we are not making this kind of threat that easily and whatever the FBI wants to do they can do but I warn the FBI they have a real problem
[2:56:54.040 --> 2:57:10.040]  now in the Department of Justice when Epstein suddenly died and committed suicide and Warren Barr said that there was a perfect storm of absurdities give me a grape. So what we have now is a major sea change on the domestic level not on the
[2:57:10.040 --> 2:57:24.040]  international level. Ironically he stayed alive. Hold on five more minutes what you're saying is Trump really is taking control of the executive he's becoming the president and by giving orders like this through the nerve centers that changes the whole way the system works and that's why the
[2:57:24.040 --> 2:57:40.040]  deep state is panicking and I totally agree the Democrats are in total panic they're siding with the most radical elements of Iran committing political suicide they don't know what to do and wow there's just five more minutes than callers I promise I'm going to get to you but I want to ask you about Pelosi the Democrats how they'll try to strike back
[2:57:40.040 --> 2:57:55.040]  that final arrow in their quiver John Bolton stay with us.
[2:58:10.040 --> 2:58:26.040]  I've lost almost 40 pounds in less than four months it's incredible so do yourself a favor try out the products if you've been on the fence you can't lose except if you don't take action because when you buy the products you're funding the operation that is always delivering
[2:58:26.040 --> 2:58:40.040]  your support and God's grace in our action but you need these products that's the real reason you want to get them is because they're amazing and then when you get great results please tell others about it word of mouth that's how we expand in the face of the NWO instead of
[2:58:40.040 --> 2:59:01.040]  imploding we're fighting to win and we are winning thanks to you. I keep my eye on the news all the time but I miss the fact that in late 2019 just about two weeks ago the CDC and the FDA approved live Ebola vaccine to be
[2:59:01.040 --> 2:59:18.040]  given inside the United States and it is an experimental vaccine it is live it's not even attenuated they've just genetically modified it so it's supposedly not lethal same stuff they did with the Gardasil vaccine that's admittedly killed
[2:59:18.040 --> 2:59:33.040]  so many this is just crazy and the Congos have the biggest outbreaks of Ebola ever since they started giving the vaccine there in the last few years oh and of course opened the borders up here and letting people in unvetted the Democrats
[2:59:33.040 --> 2:59:48.040]  distribute across the country you cannot make up the magnitude of this insanity and it is an attempted Ebola assault on America this is the new world order.
[2:59:48.040 --> 3:00:08.040]  I'm listening to the Alex Jones show I've studied politics in the world from different angles and I can tell you what Dr. Pachennick saying is just the truth.
[3:00:08.040 --> 3:00:26.040]  It's not even a statement about is it good or is it bad it's the truth and President Trump is becoming the first president in a long time to actually have the reins of power and the bureaucracies and these little circles these little advisory boards that had been in control are now fully panicked
[3:00:26.040 --> 3:00:42.040]  in fact I got a bunch of calls from DC yesterday and they were like wow everybody's really panicked even people that are against Trump they're kind of giving up right now and they're just in disarray and then Pence tried to call Pelosi to tell her stuff was going on and she wouldn't even answer the phone but they bitch and complain and say that
[3:00:42.040 --> 3:00:56.040]  Trump isn't allowed to act alone under the Constitution even though you are during an emergency so what are the Democrats going to do now because they are just degenerating in front of everybody self-destructing as you say Dr. Pachennick.
[3:00:56.040 --> 3:01:20.040]  It's self-destructing Alex I'll give you the example it's the perfect example Bernie Sanders is criticizing Biden you've got a cardiac impaired ancient geriatric socialist criticizing a neurologically deficient individual who was vice president both of whom can't really speak appropriately
[3:01:20.040 --> 3:01:36.040]  both of whom don't represent the United States and you have Nancy Pelosi who didn't know what was going on walked away and thought she could play the game of Machiavelli in turn instead she became the joker the sociopathic
[3:01:36.040 --> 3:01:52.040]  egomaniac who had no idea what's going on they're not relevant anymore Schumer is not relevant Schiff is not relevant all of California now it's got to look at its own problems but the reality correct but it's accelerating in the end phases of self-destruction
[3:01:52.040 --> 3:02:05.040]  which does still make them dangerous I mean at a certain point a dog with rabies isn't that dangerous unless it gets in a backyard with your toddler well these rabid dogs are in the backyard with toddlers I don't mean physically put them down but we do we just let them keep
[3:02:05.040 --> 3:02:23.040]  zombieing around I would let them eat devour each other I mean it couldn't be more perfect the leading candidate is Biden he has a neurological death as he just gave a speech yesterday about Iraq and he used the word I ran I mean how demented do you want a man
[3:02:23.040 --> 3:02:37.040]  like that you have Bernie Sanders a demented socialist you have Warren as socialist and why can't they see it and ever even criticize themselves enough like some days I have a bad show I do things that are wrong I admit it on air I want to be better these people
[3:02:37.040 --> 3:02:52.040]  never they just double down on everything and have no standards and are literally a group of clowns remember one thing you and I have products they have process they are not interested in the endpoint they're just interested in
[3:02:52.040 --> 3:03:09.040]  how much more they can get for themselves and send a self aggrandizing so they become incredibly narcissistic individuals which is what the psychiatrist from Yale said about Trump and I said they were wrong Jerry post you were wrong
[3:03:09.040 --> 3:03:29.040]  Dr. Lee the real narcissists who have malignant narcissism are your Democrats Nancy Pelosi with $120 million Diane Feinstein 85 who has $30 million a Bernie Sanders who's a cripple Biden who's an idiot and you get Warren who basically doesn't
[3:03:29.040 --> 3:03:47.040]  is 70 years old so you've got your narcissist killing each other when in fact all of the psychiatrist was saying we had trouble with Trump while you and I said no there's nothing wrong with Trump he's a New Yorker he's a businessman by the way politicians have become irrelevant
[3:03:47.040 --> 3:04:00.040]  and guess what we don't need these politicians and as I said before years ago we're devolving power away from the federal government to the states and your state is becoming one of the most powerful
[3:04:00.040 --> 3:04:16.040]  you said like a year ago Trump will leave New York he's leaving New York Florida it's official well that's where he belongs we don't pay state taxes you know and that's what's happening we're growing and Trump is the future he doesn't have to worry about
[3:04:16.040 --> 3:04:30.040]  impeach me because McConnell has done a brilliant job and now we got all these big comedians saying Hollywood is dead and they're a bunch of pedos to their faces and the ship is sinking literally and Trump and America is back and is winning
[3:04:30.040 --> 3:04:42.040]  I've got to agree with you Steve Pachinic dot com thanks for coming on on short notice I really appreciate you. Thank you. Bye. All right there you go now I'm going to do 10 minutes of calls I'm going to every person on here they're going to each hit one minute I really appreciate you holding
[3:04:42.040 --> 3:04:52.040]  Mike Adams takes over and then I'm going to be back on the war room to talk about what Dave Chappelle said and did it's so huge it's such a sea change stay with us
[3:04:52.040 --> 3:05:09.040]  info or store.com we have a new product and we got several thousand of these in and they're going to sell out in a few days at the rate we're selling them want to thank the listeners for getting it but this really is a game changing toothpaste and it doesn't compete with super blue that's four to five a
[3:05:09.040 --> 3:05:25.040]  colloidal silver and iodine and fluoride free the adult or the children's these are both excellent toothpaste concentrates that don't have fillers people love it this is a whitening toothpaste that also has the above sea coral calcium that also cleans but also
[3:05:25.040 --> 3:05:45.040]  mineralizes the teeth then it has the patented silver salt silver in it to knock out the bacteria that cause ginsivitis is all proven you can make claims with this but I have to tell you no one has a toothpaste this good for knocking out the bacteria the viruses and cleaning the teeth in a healthy way that doesn't strip away the
[3:05:45.040 --> 3:05:55.040]  enamel so we're really proud of it it funds the operation info or store.com that's why we're still on air thanks to you.
[3:06:16.040 --> 3:06:27.040]  You know I felt like going crazy at the start of the last hour is it and if you watch that you said okay is that an actor or is that somebody really blowing up on air.
[3:06:27.040 --> 3:06:37.040]  No that's a real something I feel like that's that was real I was in control of myself and I let myself do it so it's all real everything I say here I believe.
[3:06:37.040 --> 3:06:45.040]  But I do let the dog off the leash occasionally have a little bit of fun because it felt good to run around and get angry.
[3:06:45.040 --> 3:06:57.040]  Yesterday I'd like to act stupid like a hunting bird in front of my kids and flap my hands and jump around the house and I did it on own show just to just to sometimes not take myself so serious you know we cover really serious subjects.
[3:06:57.040 --> 3:07:07.040]  But callers call in thanking me oh you're great you're great no you're great I want freedom so do you yeah we're the majority let's come together let's do it.
[3:07:07.040 --> 3:07:12.040]  And then let's not be these people on TV that take themselves so seriously they don't have some fun sometimes.
[3:07:12.040 --> 3:07:24.040]  You know one minute I'm having fun next minute I got a former guy that used to run assassination squads on air saying John Bolton you better not try to take the president out that was not a threat folks that was a real thing on air.
[3:07:24.040 --> 3:07:30.040]  Just letting Bolton know he needs to you know watch out what he does because.
[3:07:30.040 --> 3:07:34.040]  Well the American people are watching and we wish him a long healthy wonderful life.
[3:07:34.040 --> 3:07:41.040]  And I don't know if the clinic was gonna say that on air but that's all real stuff going on and it really shows where this country is.
[3:07:41.040 --> 3:07:48.040]  And I can tell you there's a lot of people don't like America being run into the ground but America first doesn't just mean that America is now going to be like.
[3:07:48.040 --> 3:07:56.040]  You know this pious little wimp that sits in the corner and America first means America doing a lot of things that are going to seem very aggressive.
[3:07:56.040 --> 3:08:01.040]  And that doesn't mean I endorse all of those things it just means that just as we get control of the country again.
[3:08:01.040 --> 3:08:05.040]  Does it mean then that you agree with everything that presidents going to do.
[3:08:05.040 --> 3:08:11.040]  Just because he's not a bad guy you might not agree with some of that so I might not agree with that but it's a process.
[3:08:11.040 --> 3:08:17.040]  It's a process OK let's go to David Illinois thank you for holding I really appreciate it go ahead sir.
[3:08:17.040 --> 3:08:23.040]  All right he's gone I appreciate you David.
[3:08:23.040 --> 3:08:28.040]  Let's go to David in Pennsylvania thanks for holding Dave you're on the air.
[3:08:28.040 --> 3:08:32.040]  Hey Alex how's it going. Good brother thank you for holding.
[3:08:32.040 --> 3:08:36.040]  Hey God bless you and God bless everyone at info wars. Thank you.
[3:08:36.040 --> 3:08:40.040]  And and God bless all your listeners.
[3:08:40.040 --> 3:08:55.040]  Hey Alex as far as it goes what the president did. I stand by President Trump and nobody's more afraid about whether he's real or not because he carries my last name.
[3:08:55.040 --> 3:08:59.040]  You know my last name is Trump too. That's cool. That's a cool German name.
[3:08:59.040 --> 3:09:09.040]  Yes it is. So so trust me when I say I'm hoping he's real because the last thing you want to happen is someone not to be real and then you have to walk through life.
[3:09:09.040 --> 3:09:21.040]  Well here's the deal. I'm for real. I love God and I want to be a good person. Sometimes I get angry and I do bad things and later I go my God I was just out of control and I really feel bad about it.
[3:09:21.040 --> 3:09:29.040]  The key is having a conscience but I mean Trump I believe comes from a centered place of not wanting to hurt people and wanting to help America and the world.
[3:09:29.040 --> 3:09:34.040]  Like Trump said I want victory for the planet. He said I don't want just America to be free and prosperous.
[3:09:34.040 --> 3:09:43.040]  I want North Korea to be free and prosperous. I want victory for humanity and he does. He's a service guy. He wants his golf courses and hotels and happy people.
[3:09:43.040 --> 3:09:51.040]  He doesn't do well when people don't do well. He's about products at the end like Machinic was saying where he's from the top down and the bottom up.
[3:09:51.040 --> 3:10:02.040]  He gets that if we're not doing well he's not doing well. He's not a Pelosi who produces nothing and just sits between the intersection of the people in production sucking off of it.
[3:10:02.040 --> 3:10:04.040]  Does that make sense?
[3:10:04.040 --> 3:10:12.040]  That makes a lot of sense brother and I just want to say and I'm not kissing your butt. I'm not kissing your butt.
[3:10:12.040 --> 3:10:20.040]  You are a true general in the face of all of humanity because I remember back in the 90s I was listening to this guy on shortwave.
[3:10:20.040 --> 3:10:27.040]  I can't even remember his name. He was given a little tidbit about all of the corruption but he didn't want to go all the way.
[3:10:27.040 --> 3:10:36.040]  Then came Alex Joseph and said no the hell with this. You are a true general in the face of all of humanity.
[3:10:36.040 --> 3:10:44.040]  Brother no we're all, the reason I say don't build me up is build yourself up. We all did this together. We all just want freedom. God bless you. I appreciate your call Dave.
[3:10:44.040 --> 3:10:50.040]  You're awesome. Okay let's move quickly here. I want to get to everybody I can. Okay who's been on the longest here.
[3:10:50.040 --> 3:10:59.040]  That would be, my eyes are going out of the stage. That would be Matt in New Mexico. Matt go ahead.
[3:10:59.040 --> 3:11:07.040]  God bless you Alex and thank God for President Trump. You know at this point his repeated guru restraint has got to be just driving the beefsteak crazy.
[3:11:07.040 --> 3:11:17.040]  A couple quick points. This address this morning I had the same read as Pachanik. I didn't think he was uncomfortable. I think it was just a slow teleprompter.
[3:11:17.040 --> 3:11:34.040]  And this strike in Iran yesterday I really think it was just kind of to save face. You know they have a different culture and that's why they're reporting American death to kind of say see we got him back when you know just further people.
[3:11:34.040 --> 3:11:44.040]  Absolutely. Soleimani was hated in a lot of areas. I know he helped take out ISIS. That's great. But that's because he was in the Shiite Civil War with the Sunnis.
[3:11:44.040 --> 3:11:53.040]  So again I don't like killing him. I don't like this type of action. But I understand why Trump did it and so far what Trump did is working.
[3:11:53.040 --> 3:11:58.040]  And we'll see if we get peace with Iran out of this. We may.
[3:11:58.040 --> 3:12:09.040]  I think we will. I think this will be the end of it. I think those strikes yesterday were just BS. They did it just to kind of throw something up there knowing we'd shoot it down just so that they could save face and not look like wimp.
[3:12:09.040 --> 3:12:15.040]  We know they did it. It turns out they called the Pentagon up and said they were going to do it. That's on employers dot com right now. So you're absolutely right.
[3:12:15.040 --> 3:12:22.040]  And but Shannock did used to go visit. He was involved. The whole I had told a thing the whole nine yards on record. I mean he repeatedly had like a whole bunch of meetings.
[3:12:22.040 --> 3:12:30.040]  I told a commanding and all that stuff. The guy's dad. Everybody knows. And basically it was like hey you got a problem with Soleimani.
[3:12:30.040 --> 3:12:38.040]  He's not making the peace deal because there's a lot more to this than meets the eye. What's sick is watching the Democrats go in whole hog supporting Iran.
[3:12:38.040 --> 3:12:47.040]  It's one thing if you're against against the strike but to then salivate and worship the the moolas that and all those guys is sickening.
[3:12:47.040 --> 3:13:00.040]  They've gone insane. I mean they're blinded by rage and now they've just lost it completely. I think they're just throwing their hands up in the air kind of like you know the guy the Iranian yesterday and just they've lost it.
[3:13:00.040 --> 3:13:09.040]  Absolutely. Matt. Great point. Thanks for holding. I really appreciate you. OK. Let's go to Casey in Oklahoma. Go ahead Casey.
[3:13:09.040 --> 3:13:17.040]  Good morning Alex. Hey I've something hit me this morning. I called in last week. I was pretty upset about what had been done talking about how we're not waiting and that there's blood to be shed.
[3:13:17.040 --> 3:13:22.040]  And I got to draw back from that because something hit me this morning when I was sitting at the breakfast table with my wife and daughter.
[3:13:22.040 --> 3:13:31.040]  What if this is a whole nother level of 3D chess that we've not seen before. Trump was always you don't begin to be a billionaire with properties all over the world.
[3:13:31.040 --> 3:13:39.040]  You don't get to that level of status with being stupid. What if this whole entire thing with Solomoni in the Iranians was planned.
[3:13:39.040 --> 3:13:48.040]  What if this was orchestrated by Trump's behalf with back channels communicating with the Iranians and saying hey let's you put up your sacrificial lamb.
[3:13:48.040 --> 3:13:58.040]  Well I'm saying sir I don't think you just thought that this morning. That's basically what I see going on and Pachennic does have a lot of those sources.
[3:13:58.040 --> 3:14:11.040]  And that's basically what is going on. That chilled me to my bones because because think about this think how far how many steps ahead he really is that he doesn't want to allow the globalist to put us in a position to where we kill
[3:14:11.040 --> 3:14:19.040]  ourselves but put us in a position to where we can extend the olive branch to our and create allies and pull out of that area.
[3:14:19.040 --> 3:14:28.040]  You know Solomoni wasn't going to let that happen and he's dead now. And we'll see if it works because you know it's you know the CIA and all those guys.
[3:14:28.040 --> 3:14:33.040]  The better elements of it love these decisive decapitations and hope they'll work and sometimes they do a lot of times they don't.
[3:14:33.040 --> 3:14:41.040]  What is what is better is not the globalist policy of blowing the Middle East up the countries themselves and and having sanctions and starving everybody.
[3:14:41.040 --> 3:14:48.040]  This is a way to get out of that. And I would love to be friends with the Muslims but at the same time demand that they reform themselves.
[3:14:48.040 --> 3:15:02.040]  Exactly. But to me it's almost on the level of Senator Palpatine but not in a bad way that that Trump is ahead of him on so many different ways and yet he smiles at him and extends that hand to him and let them know that you're
[3:15:02.040 --> 3:15:08.040]  not going to puppeteer me like you've puppeteered other presidents and other people and officials and positions of power.
[3:15:08.040 --> 3:15:17.040]  And the deep state isn't telling the president what to do right now that itself is what what what what makes me go along with it.
[3:15:17.040 --> 3:15:23.040]  I still am really concerned because I don't I don't want to see even strikes but I understand that this is a big complex situation.
[3:15:23.040 --> 3:15:31.040]  Thank you Casey. OK Tony Eric Shannon Carlos I know you didn't call in for a free T shirt but you're going to get one because I have a rule now.
[3:15:31.040 --> 3:15:35.040]  I stay late and go to all your calls or you get a free T shirt of your life and get info or short.com.
[3:15:35.040 --> 3:15:39.040]  So please get their names and numbers and send them a free T shirt or a bottle of X3 and that's what they want.
[3:15:39.040 --> 3:15:47.040]  The big sale is going to end today. I keep set up for three days but I haven't cut the ads yet 60% off X3.
[3:15:47.040 --> 3:15:51.040]  We've got to chill for us. It's all there and it funds the operation.
[3:15:51.040 --> 3:15:57.040]  Hi I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[3:15:57.040 --> 3:16:01.040]  I beat the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[3:16:01.040 --> 3:16:06.040]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[3:16:06.040 --> 3:16:13.040]  I can help you too. If you owe taxes you can't pay. Don't wait another day. There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.

[3:17:52.040 --> 3:18:00.040]  I wanted to talk about Super Silver whitening toothpaste because I hadn't tried it except for maybe the last week and a half and I told Alex.
[3:18:00.040 --> 3:18:04.040]  I said, man, this is the best toothpaste I've ever tried. He's like, well, what are you doing just sitting in here telling me?
[3:18:04.040 --> 3:18:13.040]  You got to get up there and tell people. So here I am telling people Super Silver whitening toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste I've ever tried.
[3:18:13.040 --> 3:18:18.040]  And I'm 45 years old and I've tried a lot of different toothpaste and it's fluoride free.
[3:18:18.040 --> 3:18:30.040]  I think the big difference the game changer in this is the coral calcium because after I brush my teeth with this, they feel so clean and the toothpaste that I don't even like rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this.
[3:18:30.040 --> 3:18:35.040]  It feels so good. It feels like it feels like good things are happening in my mouth.
[3:18:35.040 --> 3:18:52.040]  In fact, I find myself brushing my teeth three to four times a day rather than just twice a day now because I like the way it feels.
[3:18:52.040 --> 3:19:03.040]  Andy in Florida. Thank you, Andy. Go ahead. Hey, Alex, I love you, man. We love you. Before I go ahead and talk about the topic on hand, I got to talk about one of your product. A little bit about me. I'm 245 pounds.
[3:19:03.040 --> 3:19:14.040]  I work about 10 to 13 hours a day at UPS and make a long story short. I used to have a problem with Adderall. I do have ADHD, but, you know, I was taking Adderall for its energy boosting properties.
[3:19:14.040 --> 3:19:24.040]  You know, I kind of got a little out of hand and, you know, I listen to you religiously in my truck every day. So I tried your turbo force and really it's a cliche. This product changed my life, but turbo force really changed my life.
[3:19:24.040 --> 3:19:31.040]  He was there no longer take Adderall and I get by literally the 13 hours a day I work on a half of a packet of your turbo force.
[3:19:31.040 --> 3:19:38.040]  And if you take a half a packet, that's literally a dollar a day and you save so much money versus, you know, a monster, which is what 499.
[3:19:38.040 --> 3:19:44.040]  And, you know, I just had to call and tell you guys how great turbo force is. And if anybody's on the fence, they really have to try it.
[3:19:44.040 --> 3:19:48.040]  We're really proud of turbo force. So thank you, sir. Commit to buy a lot of your products at m4store.com.
[3:19:48.040 --> 3:20:10.040]  Then help us spread the word and let's just get busy m4store.com.
[3:20:10.040 --> 3:20:18.040]  Now, but as with all new technologies, drugs and products, what do we really know about how they affect our health, especially long term?
[3:20:18.040 --> 3:20:28.040]  No one can say for sure in the beginning and as with most big industries by the time scientific studies are performed, there's enough money at stake that negative findings are suppressed.
[3:20:28.040 --> 3:20:40.040]  Well, when it comes to the latest in mobile networks, wireless technology and smart devices, make no mistake, there is an attack being perpetuated on your health and well-being.
[3:20:40.040 --> 3:20:45.040]  The cell tower going up in your neighborhood, if it's not now, it may soon.
[3:20:45.040 --> 3:20:50.040]  They say it would allow phone companies to put up new antennas in your neighborhood, whether you like it or not.
[3:20:50.040 --> 3:20:58.040]  But to pave the way for that game change, telecom companies need to put up between 30,000 and 50,000 of these small cell antennas.
[3:20:58.040 --> 3:21:05.040]  Local neighborhoods would be seeing something the size of a refrigerator showing up on a street pole and they could say nothing to stop it.
[3:21:05.040 --> 3:21:08.040]  They have no place in front of homes in residential neighborhoods.
[3:21:08.040 --> 3:21:10.040]  Now, what about the ones that are right now?
[3:21:10.040 --> 3:21:11.040]  The ones that are right now?
[3:21:11.040 --> 3:21:12.040]  Excuse me.
[3:21:12.040 --> 3:21:18.040]  Of all the places in Shadyside, why are you trying to put a cell phone tower in my kids' playroom?
[3:21:18.040 --> 3:21:27.040]  It's because you're getting beamed with all these invisible signals, but they're high-powered signals that are directionally aimed at the devices that are using them.
[3:21:27.040 --> 3:21:34.040]  The manufacturers actually tell people in the instruction manual, which I've never read, not to put the cell phone against your ear.
[3:21:34.040 --> 3:21:36.040]  It's time to tell the character of the truth.
[3:21:36.040 --> 3:21:40.040]  Wireless products can't be put in hundreds of your hair.
[3:21:40.040 --> 3:21:41.040]  You'll do that.
[3:21:41.040 --> 3:21:49.040]  It's the world's first electronic computer.
[3:21:49.040 --> 3:21:57.040]  Right now, it's solving mathematical problems for the U.S. Army, but who knows, someday a machine like this may check up on your income tax.
[3:22:03.040 --> 3:22:09.040]  Any technology that pollutes the air by sending signals wirelessly can contribute to electropollution.
[3:22:09.040 --> 3:22:13.040]  Today, that means more than cell phones, laptops, and tablets.
[3:22:13.040 --> 3:22:21.040]  It means all of your smart devices, from TVs to toasters, smart meters to baby monitors, and refrigerators to speakers.
[3:22:21.040 --> 3:22:28.040]  Even fitness trackers have recently shown to negatively impact wearers with the Wi-Fi radiation they give off,
[3:22:28.040 --> 3:22:32.040]  causing a variety of reactions ranging from skin rash to insomnia.
[3:22:32.040 --> 3:22:36.040]  All of these devices all emit electromagnetic radiation,
[3:22:36.040 --> 3:22:42.040]  often abbreviated as EMR or EMF for electromagnetic frequency.
[3:22:42.040 --> 3:22:46.040]  This kind of radiation is non-ionizing radiation.
[3:22:46.040 --> 3:22:52.040]  The risks from ionizing radiation, such as that from x-rays and nuclear power, are not as contested.
[3:22:52.040 --> 3:22:57.040]  Because it is non-ionizing, the industry would have you believe it is risk-free.
[3:22:57.040 --> 3:23:04.040]  But studies show this kind of radiation does impact human health, especially over an extended period of time.
[3:23:04.040 --> 3:23:11.040]  As these bands become cluttered with more and more devices, the networks slow down, unable to meet demand.
[3:23:11.040 --> 3:23:20.040]  This is supposedly why engineers created 5G, a place in the spectrum that still has wide bandwidth available, in the millimeter range.
[3:23:20.040 --> 3:23:30.040]  Millimeter wave technology will supposedly offer us the ability to transfer and download vast amounts of data and videos, with speeds up to 100 times faster.
[3:23:30.040 --> 3:23:38.040]  Downsides admitted to include massive use of battery life and the need for more cell towers. A lot more.
[3:23:38.040 --> 3:23:45.040]  Millimeter waves are short waves, therefore obstructed easily by buildings and other physical or geographical objects,
[3:23:45.040 --> 3:23:49.040]  which translate to a need for many, many more towers.
[3:23:49.040 --> 3:23:54.040]  In fact, experts estimate that we will need one tower for every 12 homes.
[3:23:54.040 --> 3:23:59.040]  This would make it virtually impossible to avoid the radiation from these towers.
[3:23:59.040 --> 3:24:05.040]  People are getting neurological effects, people are getting cancer from wireless radiation, people are getting immune system problems,
[3:24:05.040 --> 3:24:09.040]  and fertility is affected, basically affecting all systems of the body.
[3:24:09.040 --> 3:24:15.040]  Proponents point out that this move will drive the economy with jobs, such as for installing new towers.
[3:24:15.040 --> 3:24:19.040]  But what about the health concerns associated with the technology?
[3:24:19.040 --> 3:24:23.040]  Is it our economic duty to suffer the risks to our health?
[3:24:23.040 --> 3:24:29.040]  Cell phones first appeared in consumer markets in the 1980s without any government safety testing.
[3:24:29.040 --> 3:24:34.040]  Less than a decade later, users were already being diagnosed with lethal brain tumors,
[3:24:34.040 --> 3:24:39.040]  with lawsuits and fake research to prove safety following soon thereafter.
[3:24:39.040 --> 3:24:45.040]  As early as the 1990s, when fewer than 10 out of every 100 American adults had a cell phone,
[3:24:45.040 --> 3:24:51.040]  scientists proved that radiation from cell phones and towers damages DNA.
[3:24:51.040 --> 3:24:55.040]  Quickly thereafter, this science began piling up.
[3:24:55.040 --> 3:25:01.040]  Multiple studies show a link to brain cancer and brain tumors, up to three times increased risk,
[3:25:01.040 --> 3:25:05.040]  with even higher risk for those who use cell phones before age 20.
[3:25:05.040 --> 3:25:09.040]  Studies show radiation from cell phones caused tumors around the heart.
[3:25:09.040 --> 3:25:17.040]  On the second floor where it took me lessons, there are seven wireless routers on the ceiling and many people using wireless laptops.
[3:25:17.040 --> 3:25:21.040]  It was there that I felt like a volcano was erupting in my heart.
[3:25:21.040 --> 3:25:27.040]  Scientists repeatedly find that cell phone radiation impacts fertility and causes low sperm counts,
[3:25:27.040 --> 3:25:31.040]  and increases risk of miscarriage by as much as 50%.
[3:25:31.040 --> 3:25:39.040]  Studies link EMF radiation to autoimmune diseases and mental health problems, from anxiety to dementia.
[3:25:39.040 --> 3:25:46.040]  EMFs have been found to change the behavior of tissues and cells, harming blood, DNA and bone marrow,
[3:25:46.040 --> 3:25:54.040]  as well as compromising whole systems such as the reproductive system, endocrine system and cardiovascular system.
[3:25:54.040 --> 3:25:57.040]  So what is prolonged exposure then?
[3:25:57.040 --> 3:26:07.040]  Well, the industry would have you believe and have the industry funded studies that show cell phones are safe unless you are a heavy user.
[3:26:07.040 --> 3:26:16.040]  The problem is that what was heavy use 10 years ago, approximately 9 hours of exposure per day, is light use today.
[3:26:16.040 --> 3:26:20.040]  If anything, the risk is even greater than these findings may imply.
[3:26:20.040 --> 3:26:27.040]  When independent scientists performed a detailed biological assessment of how cell phone radiation affects tissue,
[3:26:27.040 --> 3:26:33.040]  they found a direct link between exposure and an increase in tumors in the heart and brain.
[3:26:33.040 --> 3:26:41.040]  According to the researchers, just 20 minutes of cell phone use every day can triple your risk of developing a brain tumor.
[3:26:41.040 --> 3:26:48.040]  Combine that with the fact that 9 out of 10 cell phones exceed regulatory limits for radiation, according to the latest data,
[3:26:48.040 --> 3:26:54.040]  with most emitting 3 times the radiation as manufacturers claim, and you can begin to see the concern.
[3:26:54.040 --> 3:26:57.040]  And 5G makes it all worse.
[3:26:57.040 --> 3:27:04.040]  Cell towers, mobile phones, smart meters and other smart devices emit electromagnetic radiation.
[3:27:04.040 --> 3:27:10.040]  These frequencies are how the new technology will enable downloading more data at higher speeds.
[3:27:10.040 --> 3:27:17.040]  Additionally, 5G networks will employ MIMO technology, an acronym for multiple input, multiple output.
[3:27:17.040 --> 3:27:23.040]  This type of technology uses a lot more transmitters per cell tower to send and receive information.
[3:27:23.040 --> 3:27:31.040]  This increase in transmissions and therefore EMF exposure is expected to correlate to an increase in health trauma.
[3:27:31.040 --> 3:27:34.040]  Trials of the new technology have not gone well.
[3:27:34.040 --> 3:27:41.040]  After 5G was installed around firehouses in San Francisco, firefighters started reporting unusual health problems,
[3:27:41.040 --> 3:27:44.040]  ranging from confusion to memory problems.
[3:27:44.040 --> 3:27:46.040]  Symptoms disappeared when they relocated.
[3:27:46.040 --> 3:27:54.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, this documentary is posted at infowars.com on the front page right now.
[3:27:54.040 --> 3:27:58.040]  It's also posted at naturalnews.com, whatever you do, get it. 5G, next-gen health dangers documentary.
[3:27:58.040 --> 3:28:04.040]  And I don't know, and it's not about groveling because he's such a humble guy.
[3:28:04.040 --> 3:28:07.040]  It's how much work Mike Adams does, how much he churns out.
[3:28:07.040 --> 3:28:10.040]  The guy is a wrecking ball to tyranny.
[3:28:10.040 --> 3:28:12.040]  So we're going to air the rest of this.
[3:28:12.040 --> 3:28:17.040]  He had problems with the Skype, which is great because this documentary needed to be seen.
[3:28:17.040 --> 3:28:18.040]  He was going to play Club 7.
[3:28:18.040 --> 3:28:22.040]  Now we're going to play the whole thing in the next two segments that he'll pop in via audio right at the end of the show.
[3:28:22.040 --> 3:28:27.040]  But whatever you do, share the live link right now at band.video and infowars.com for his last show.
[3:28:27.040 --> 3:28:31.040]  We're going to stream this, but then go to infowars.com on the front page.
[3:28:31.040 --> 3:28:35.040]  You get the 5G, next-gen health dangers documentary and share it.
[3:28:35.040 --> 3:28:40.040]  I mean, these documentaries, he's churning one out like every weekend running all his other operations.
[3:28:40.040 --> 3:28:42.040]  He's Superman.
[3:28:42.040 --> 3:28:46.040]  So I just sleep better at night knowing there's Mike Adams, get this documentary out.
[3:28:46.040 --> 3:29:11.040]  It's incredible.
[3:29:16.040 --> 3:29:21.040]  We're going to stream this right now at band.video and infowars.com on the front page.
[3:29:46.040 --> 3:29:49.040]  Your Wireless Home Network today with Flash Routers.
[3:30:16.040 --> 3:30:21.040]  We're going to stream this right now at band.video and infowars.com on the front page.
[3:30:46.040 --> 3:30:58.040]  It's either happened to every person listening or it's happened to someone you know.
[3:30:58.040 --> 3:31:08.040]  Everybody is well aware of the fact that most people that end up getting the flu have taken the flu vaccine right before they get it.
[3:31:08.040 --> 3:31:21.040]  And that they get the worst case of the flu of their life. But still, by concentration camp victims, they line up at the different pharmacies and clinics to get the injections.
[3:31:21.040 --> 3:31:32.040]  It doesn't matter that studies, mainline government studies in Canada and Europe show that when you take the flu vaccine, it doubles your chances of getting the flu the next season by lowering your immunity.
[3:31:32.040 --> 3:31:43.040]  It goes on and on. Or the fact that the governments have never guessed the next year's mutation at the flu vaccine has never, ever even worked.
[3:31:43.040 --> 3:31:55.040]  But how do you problem a hoax? You keep the giant hoax going. No wonder we've got one of the worst flu seasons on record happening right now.
[3:31:55.040 --> 3:32:04.040]  Owl killer in New Jersey. You're on the air. Go ahead. Alex. Hey, I just want to say it's great to be back once again. And I've never gotten to do this, but I'm going to give you a shout out for your product.
[3:32:04.040 --> 3:32:14.040]  So that's super blue fluoride free toothpaste and that super blue whitening toothpaste is on another level. I use the one I use the super blue in the morning and then the whitening at night and it absorbs into your gum.
[3:32:14.040 --> 3:32:20.040]  It is by far the best product I've ever used in my life. I literally just took turbo force on my way to the gym right now.
[3:32:20.040 --> 3:32:28.040]  I've had four shoulder surgeries and a back surgery and that body has made me feel better than any type of physical therapy or anything that I've ever done in my life.
[3:32:28.040 --> 3:32:36.040]  So I just want to get that out of the way. Support this man. Everything that he exposed. Nobody knew about Bohemian growth. Nobody knew about Epstein. Nobody knew about Bilderberg.
[3:32:36.040 --> 3:32:40.040]  Nobody called 9-11 before it happened in July 2001. Go look it up yourself.
[3:32:40.040 --> 3:32:50.040]  Well, we try our best, sir. They definitely want us off the air without you or not here. But yeah, these are all great products. So thank you, sir.
[3:33:10.040 --> 3:33:19.040]  5G is a weapon. 5G gives you cancer. 5G surveils you.
[3:33:19.040 --> 3:33:29.040]  Switzerland's banning at many of its states. Cancons. Israel invented this bandit. Chinese communist. Wally's 5G's been banned by Trump.
[3:33:29.040 --> 3:33:35.040]  But other companies like Apple, AT&T and Verizon were supposed to bow down to him.
[3:33:35.040 --> 3:33:41.040]  Doesn't matter who owns the microwave that fries you. What matters is you're fried.
[3:33:41.040 --> 3:33:46.040]  The documentary's posted right now on 5G Next Generation Health Dangers documentary about Mike Adams.
[3:33:46.040 --> 3:33:49.040]  He's coming up in a moment, but here's more of the film.
[3:33:49.040 --> 3:33:57.040]  According to the latest data, with most emitting three times the radiation as manufacturers claim, and you can begin to see the concern.
[3:33:57.040 --> 3:34:06.040]  5G makes it all worse. Cell towers, mobile phones, smart meters and other smart devices emit electromagnetic radiation.
[3:34:06.040 --> 3:34:12.040]  These frequencies are how the new technology will enable downloading more data at higher speeds.
[3:34:12.040 --> 3:34:19.040]  Additionally, 5G networks will employ MIMO technology, an acronym for multiple input, multiple output.
[3:34:19.040 --> 3:34:26.040]  This type of technology uses a lot more transmitters per cell tower to send and receive information.
[3:34:26.040 --> 3:34:33.040]  Its increase in transmissions and therefore EMF exposure is expected to correlate to an increase in health trauma.
[3:34:33.040 --> 3:34:40.040]  Trials of the new technology have not gone well. After 5G was installed around firehouses in San Francisco,
[3:34:40.040 --> 3:34:46.040]  firefighters started reporting unusual health problems, ranging from confusion to memory problems.
[3:34:46.040 --> 3:34:50.040]  Symptoms disappeared when they relocated to different fire stations.
[3:34:50.040 --> 3:34:59.040]  And last time I checked, firefighters weighing in, who dorm and live, we are not transient employees at the fire stations.
[3:34:59.040 --> 3:35:08.040]  When did we stop mattering as far as input goes from people and stakeholders for what the impact is going to be these towers?
[3:35:08.040 --> 3:35:15.040]  A scientist from Gateshead, England is speaking out about the health problems 5G has created in his community.
[3:35:15.040 --> 3:35:23.040]  After 5G was installed in their street lamps in 2016, residents started experiencing a variety of side effects,
[3:35:23.040 --> 3:35:29.040]  ranging from insomnia to nosebleeds and even miscarriages, birth defects and stillbirths.
[3:35:29.040 --> 3:35:36.040]  Scientists believe the EMF radiation disrupts gene expression and the body's ability to keep cells healthy.
[3:35:36.040 --> 3:35:41.040]  Millimeter wave radiation has been shown to be more easily absorbed by human skin,
[3:35:41.040 --> 3:35:48.040]  leading Israeli experts to warn of increased risk of skin cancer and skin diseases for those exposed to this type of radiation.
[3:35:48.040 --> 3:35:56.040]  In 2002, a Russian study confirmed that millimeter wave technology compromises the immune system.
[3:35:56.040 --> 3:36:01.040]  Separate Polish and Japanese studies found that the technology damages eye tissue.
[3:36:01.040 --> 3:36:09.040]  Other research linked exposure to disruptions in heartbeats and rhythms and linked it to heart disease, sleep disorders and infertility.
[3:36:09.040 --> 3:36:14.040]  We are already being bombarded with electromagnetic pollution from our smartphones,
[3:36:14.040 --> 3:36:19.040]  Wi-Fi, smart meters, new vehicles and all the other automated devices on the market.
[3:36:19.040 --> 3:36:24.040]  Recently, it was proven that smart meters interfere with normal heart function.
[3:36:24.040 --> 3:36:32.040]  They emit a constant bombardment of microwave radiation that can be very damaging to the heart, which most people don't realize.
[3:36:32.040 --> 3:36:39.040]  As our society moves towards smart homes and smart cities, driverless cars and autonomous augmented realities,
[3:36:39.040 --> 3:36:43.040]  we will all become even more saturated in electro pollution.
[3:36:43.040 --> 3:36:46.040]  It's not just children and pregnant women that are in danger.
[3:36:46.040 --> 3:36:49.040]  Peer reviewed studies have consistently shown that...
[3:36:49.040 --> 3:36:53.040]  Again, this is so powerful, even though I already watched it yesterday,
[3:36:53.040 --> 3:36:58.040]  that I'm just sitting here in the studio with Mike Adams about to take over and I'm watching it again
[3:36:58.040 --> 3:37:06.040]  and thinking, when I get home tonight, I'm going to turn the TV on, plug it into Brighton or Band.Video,
[3:37:06.040 --> 3:37:11.040]  and I'm going to have my children watch this because they already know these issues,
[3:37:11.040 --> 3:37:14.040]  but this is so important. We have to make a big issue out of this.
[3:37:14.040 --> 3:37:19.040]  We just can't have 29,000 views in one day at Band.Video,
[3:37:19.040 --> 3:37:22.040]  and I'm sure tens of thousands over on his Brighton site.
[3:37:22.040 --> 3:37:24.040]  This is Band on YouTube.
[3:37:24.040 --> 3:37:26.040]  We're showing you mainline studies, documents.
[3:37:26.040 --> 3:37:30.040]  Think about this. They have banned him even more than us at many levels.
[3:37:30.040 --> 3:37:32.040]  This is sick evil.
[3:37:32.040 --> 3:37:35.040]  So Mike Adams is taking over right now, but I've got to tell you,
[3:37:35.040 --> 3:37:40.040]  I think I'm going to play this during the first hour tomorrow of my show to signify to everybody
[3:37:40.040 --> 3:37:43.040]  that, hey, the fourth hour is as important as the first hour,
[3:37:43.040 --> 3:37:47.040]  but it's when we have a bigger audience in general as the first and second hour.
[3:37:47.040 --> 3:37:53.040]  In fact, I'm going to play this in the second hour tomorrow because everybody needs to invest in caring
[3:37:53.040 --> 3:37:56.040]  and understanding the other got 6G coming out.
[3:37:56.040 --> 3:38:01.040]  So everyone, share it from infowars.com, share it from naturalnews.com,
[3:38:01.040 --> 3:38:04.040]  share it from Band on Video, share it from Brighton.com.
[3:38:04.040 --> 3:38:06.040]  Whatever you do, take action and fight back.
[3:38:06.040 --> 3:38:09.040]  And I know I say this all the time because don't thank me when you tune in.
[3:38:09.040 --> 3:38:12.040]  I'm thanking you for caring. We're in this boat together.
[3:38:12.040 --> 3:38:14.040]  We're all bailing water together.
[3:38:14.040 --> 3:38:17.040]  We can get to the island of reawakening and common sense and a programming future,
[3:38:17.040 --> 3:38:20.040]  but this is a anti-human eugenics plan.
[3:38:20.040 --> 3:38:23.040]  We've got to, as Paul Revere's, get the word out.
[3:38:23.040 --> 3:38:25.040]  So I salute Mike Adams for this documentary.
[3:38:25.040 --> 3:38:28.040]  5G next-gen health dangers documentary.
[3:38:28.040 --> 3:38:30.040]  Now you know what to do, Paul Revere's.
[3:38:30.040 --> 3:38:33.040]  Well, now let's go to Mike Adams.
[3:38:33.040 --> 3:38:36.040]  Well, thank you, Alex, and I got to thank your team there at Band on Video.
[3:38:36.040 --> 3:38:41.040]  They gave us a channel to start uploading this video content maybe a month ago or so.
[3:38:41.040 --> 3:38:44.040]  We've been posting, I think, about a video a day to your channel.
[3:38:44.040 --> 3:38:46.040]  And here's some good news.
[3:38:46.040 --> 3:38:51.040]  We now have a three-person team dedicated to making more of these documentaries,
[3:38:51.040 --> 3:38:55.040]  and every single one of them will be uploaded to Band.video.
[3:38:55.040 --> 3:38:58.040]  And just the fact that you have that platform, that you're able to fund it,
[3:38:58.040 --> 3:39:02.040]  and that we, in parallel, have Brighttown.com so that if one of us gets banned,
[3:39:02.040 --> 3:39:05.040]  you know, the other one has the same videos there as well.
[3:39:05.040 --> 3:39:06.040]  It's amazing.
[3:39:06.040 --> 3:39:08.040]  This could not have been seen if you and I hadn't separately done this
[3:39:08.040 --> 3:39:11.040]  ahead of the time we knew it was coming.
[3:39:11.040 --> 3:39:12.040]  That's right. That's right.
[3:39:12.040 --> 3:39:14.040]  And that's why we've had the same mindset about this.
[3:39:14.040 --> 3:39:16.040]  Build platforms. Use our platforms.
[3:39:16.040 --> 3:39:18.040]  Stop promoting the evil tech platforms.
[3:39:18.040 --> 3:39:23.040]  Use our platforms and encourage our incredible supporters who are supporting you
[3:39:23.040 --> 3:39:25.040]  in many ways, and I'm going to talk about that in just a second,
[3:39:25.040 --> 3:39:28.040]  but encourage them to share on these platforms.
[3:39:28.040 --> 3:39:32.040]  Stop making billions for Mark Zuckerberg or Sundar Pinchai
[3:39:32.040 --> 3:39:33.040]  or these others.
[3:39:33.040 --> 3:39:36.040]  Support Band.video or Brighttown or alternative platforms.
[3:39:36.040 --> 3:39:40.040]  Now, I got to mention, we're doing some research on this, Alex,
[3:39:40.040 --> 3:39:43.040]  and your audience is going to be fascinated about this,
[3:39:43.040 --> 3:39:44.040]  but there are.
[3:39:44.040 --> 3:39:51.040]  What we know so far is that taking in antioxidants helps your body
[3:39:51.040 --> 3:39:56.040]  eliminate the toxic molecules that are created due to 5G exposure.
[3:39:56.040 --> 3:39:58.040]  Now, of course, we haven't done clinical trials yet.
[3:39:58.040 --> 3:40:01.040]  We don't know exactly which antioxidants are the most effective.
[3:40:01.040 --> 3:40:03.040]  We're conducting research on that,
[3:40:03.040 --> 3:40:07.040]  but what we can say right now is that the molecules that are created
[3:40:07.040 --> 3:40:10.040]  from 5G exposure that are created inside your body,
[3:40:10.040 --> 3:40:15.040]  that circulate in your blood, they are the most damaging radicals
[3:40:15.040 --> 3:40:19.040]  that can damage your brain tissue and your neurology,
[3:40:19.040 --> 3:40:22.040]  and they are in your body the moment you're exposed to 5G.
[3:40:22.040 --> 3:40:27.040]  And if you don't have some superfoods or supplements or a good diet
[3:40:27.040 --> 3:40:29.040]  that's got good antioxidants in it,
[3:40:29.040 --> 3:40:34.040]  then those dangerous molecules are causing literal brain damage.
[3:40:34.040 --> 3:40:38.040]  But if you have the right supplements, the right classes of antioxidants,
[3:40:38.040 --> 3:40:42.040]  these superfoods, many of the items that you offer, Alex,
[3:40:42.040 --> 3:40:44.040]  then your body can neutralize these.
[3:40:44.040 --> 3:40:48.040]  And I think this is going to be a key for nutritional survival
[3:40:48.040 --> 3:40:52.040]  of your brain from this day forward is going to be,
[3:40:52.040 --> 3:40:56.040]  do you have the nutrition to protect yourself from the dangers
[3:40:56.040 --> 3:41:01.040]  of 5G exposure that literally have a chemical impact on your body
[3:41:01.040 --> 3:41:05.040]  and create brain damaging molecules right inside your own blood?
[3:41:05.040 --> 3:41:07.040]  And this, again, we're doing more research on this.
[3:41:07.040 --> 3:41:10.040]  Of course, we'll be sharing it with your audience and our audience
[3:41:10.040 --> 3:41:12.040]  and doing documentaries and so on.
[3:41:12.040 --> 3:41:15.040]  But the good news is, more documentaries are also on the way
[3:41:15.040 --> 3:41:17.040]  on different topics.
[3:41:17.040 --> 3:41:20.040]  I was just talking to my team this morning that's doing these,
[3:41:20.040 --> 3:41:22.040]  what I call mini documentaries,
[3:41:22.040 --> 3:41:25.040]  and I approved two more scripts that are going to be in production.
[3:41:25.040 --> 3:41:29.040]  We're going to share all of these with you at infowars.com and band.video.
[3:41:29.040 --> 3:41:32.040]  So look, we are the new media.
[3:41:32.040 --> 3:41:35.040]  We cover the topics that nobody's willing to cover.
[3:41:35.040 --> 3:41:38.040]  This platform that you're watching right now, infowars.com,
[3:41:38.040 --> 3:41:41.040]  is absolutely crucial in this fight for humanity.
[3:41:41.040 --> 3:41:42.040]  And we are building more platforms.
[3:41:42.040 --> 3:41:47.040]  We have more announcements coming out in the next few weeks, actually,
[3:41:47.040 --> 3:41:48.040]  some really good things.
[3:41:48.040 --> 3:41:50.040]  This is what it's all about.
[3:41:50.040 --> 3:41:51.040]  We take your support.
[3:41:51.040 --> 3:41:55.040]  When you support Infowars and Infowars Store and alternative media platforms,
[3:41:55.040 --> 3:41:59.040]  all of us, Alex, myself and others, we take those resources
[3:41:59.040 --> 3:42:01.040]  and instead of stuffing them into our own pockets,
[3:42:01.040 --> 3:42:05.040]  we put them into investments in infrastructure to help set humanity free.
[3:42:05.040 --> 3:42:08.040]  And that's because it's not just that we're perfect goody tissues.
[3:42:08.040 --> 3:42:09.040]  It's a war.
[3:42:09.040 --> 3:42:10.040]  We know this is real.
[3:42:10.040 --> 3:42:11.040]  We want to defeat this.
[3:42:11.040 --> 3:42:12.040]  We've been banned.
[3:42:12.040 --> 3:42:15.040]  We're building this infrastructure because having our voice
[3:42:15.040 --> 3:42:18.040]  is like having oxygen when you've been held under water.
[3:42:18.040 --> 3:42:19.040]  We are fighting for our lives.
[3:42:19.040 --> 3:42:21.040]  We have survival instincts.
[3:42:21.040 --> 3:42:22.040]  They've not broken our will.
[3:42:22.040 --> 3:42:23.040]  Our spirits are strong.
[3:42:23.040 --> 3:42:26.040]  We're linking it with other humans that have strong spirits.
[3:42:26.040 --> 3:42:27.040]  It doesn't matter what color you are.
[3:42:27.040 --> 3:42:28.040]  It's the spirit you have.
[3:42:28.040 --> 3:42:29.040]  We're brothers.
[3:42:29.040 --> 3:42:30.040]  We're sisters.
[3:42:30.040 --> 3:42:31.040]  We'rezony.
[3:42:31.040 --> 3:42:34.040]  And I know Mike is about to launch some beautiful new infrastructure
[3:42:34.040 --> 3:42:36.040]  that is going to terrify the enemy to all those slime bags,
[3:42:36.040 --> 3:42:37.040]  know the fear of God,
[3:42:37.040 --> 3:42:41.040]  and then we're never going to back down and never surrender.
[3:42:41.040 --> 3:42:43.040]  Mike Adams takes over from NaturalNews.com.
[3:42:43.040 --> 3:42:45.040]  On the other side, NCAA.
[3:42:45.040 --> 3:42:46.040]  stay with us.
[3:42:46.040 --> 3:42:56.520]  news today the globalists know that I will never willingly give up I've said
[3:42:56.520 --> 3:43:01.760]  it many times I will never give in I will never give up but I could give out
[3:43:01.760 --> 3:43:06.760]  and it's very very frustrating to see them committing all their crimes
[3:43:06.760 --> 3:43:13.080]  against humanity to see evil running rampant like this and to know that most
[3:43:13.080 --> 3:43:17.880]  Americans have already been silenced in cyberspace that most Americans have
[3:43:17.880 --> 3:43:23.000]  already been shadow banned by big tech and to know that most Americans feel
[3:43:23.000 --> 3:43:28.500]  powerless and don't realize how much power they have by spreading the word
[3:43:28.500 --> 3:43:33.680]  about news wars.com info wars.com and banned on video and that people are
[3:43:33.680 --> 3:43:37.440]  hungry for the truth now more than ever and then if you tell people hey the
[3:43:37.440 --> 3:43:41.960]  banned truth they don't want you to have is at info wars.com forward slash show
[3:43:41.960 --> 3:43:46.800]  and banned on video so take heart folks they've had to censor everybody to show
[3:43:46.800 --> 3:43:50.360]  everybody down because the truth is powerful and they can't beat us fair
[3:43:50.360 --> 3:43:53.840]  and square. I would thank you for everything you've done for the info
[3:43:53.840 --> 3:43:58.440]  war but I know you're like me you don't want my thanks you want victory over the
[3:43:58.440 --> 3:44:01.760]  globalist and these devil worship and child molesters and you want them off
[3:44:01.760 --> 3:44:05.360]  your back and off your children's back you know what I'm the same way and that's
[3:44:05.360 --> 3:44:09.760]  why we're on the same damn team and it's why info wars has been delivering time
[3:44:09.760 --> 3:44:16.000]  and time again when it's clutch time to focus the people on taking action against
[3:44:16.000 --> 3:44:21.440]  the globalist because I'm committed to a future for humanity and I know you are
[3:44:21.440 --> 3:44:25.560]  as well so thank you in 2019 for standing with us because you are the
[3:44:25.560 --> 3:44:29.160]  info war and I want to thank you for committing to stand with us in 2020
[3:44:29.160 --> 3:44:33.240]  however you can for bottom my heart from my family and from the great crew at
[3:44:33.240 --> 3:44:37.520]  info wars I want to thank you all because you are the info war and you know
[3:44:37.520 --> 3:44:42.680]  that's not just words that's reality you have made history we have made history
[3:44:42.680 --> 3:44:49.640]  together info wars dot com only has power because of you and I suggest you
[3:44:49.640 --> 3:44:54.200]  use it the best product I'm not I'm not supposed to be biased but I'm gonna tell
[3:44:54.200 --> 3:44:57.400]  you all now if you haven't tried turbo force you need to try it I've tried
[3:44:57.400 --> 3:45:01.720]  turbo force with everything sometimes you know I went a little bit crazy I put
[3:45:01.720 --> 3:45:05.360]  turbo force in my coffee that was a crazy week I don't remember sleeping but
[3:45:05.360 --> 3:45:08.600]  as far as the products go turbo force is my favorite and all the info wars
[3:45:08.600 --> 3:45:13.040]  products are down to take control your life take control your health not
[3:45:13.040 --> 3:45:18.560]  relying on other people to do it for you nobody wakes up in the morning and
[3:45:18.560 --> 3:45:21.560]  thinks I'm gonna give that person over there a better life I'm gonna wake up
[3:45:21.560 --> 3:45:25.040]  today you know I'm gonna spend my entire day trying to make that guy over
[3:45:25.040 --> 3:45:28.320]  there healthier happier and richer I'm gonna make sure he gets a Ferrari and a
[3:45:28.320 --> 3:45:31.280]  girlfriend I don't think that happens very often it's never happened to me I've
[3:45:31.280 --> 3:45:34.200]  never had anyone knock on my door and said Tate you're such a good guy how
[3:45:34.200 --> 3:45:37.280]  can I improve your life in every single way there's only one person who woke up
[3:45:37.280 --> 3:45:40.720]  and thought that and that was me I woke up and thought you know what okay I want
[3:45:40.720 --> 3:45:43.160]  to take control of my life I want to take control of my health and that's why
[3:45:43.160 --> 3:45:45.480]  you need to go to info wars calm take control of your health right now and
[3:45:45.480 --> 3:45:48.680]  support the resistance don't buy into the group think don't drink the Kool-Aid
[3:45:48.680 --> 3:45:52.960]  drink the turbo force Kool-Aid's bad the turbo force is good if you understand
[3:45:52.960 --> 3:45:57.760]  why the globalist why the servants of Satan hate info wars it's because we're
[3:45:57.760 --> 3:46:04.360]  awake we're alive we're passionate and we're not giving up that's why it's
[3:46:04.360 --> 3:46:09.000]  critical for those of us that are aware of the new world order's plans to not
[3:46:09.000 --> 3:46:12.720]  get down when they attack us and they persecute us and they lie about us
[3:46:12.720 --> 3:46:18.000]  that's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags the
[3:46:18.000 --> 3:46:21.720]  globalists have literally sold their soul to the dark side and they do what
[3:46:21.720 --> 3:46:26.080]  they do because they're slaves because they are eternally driven to try to
[3:46:26.080 --> 3:46:31.240]  suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent it is up to us who are awake
[3:46:31.240 --> 3:46:37.320]  not the sheep and not the wolves but the sheep dogs to stand firm and resist
[3:46:37.320 --> 3:46:42.960]  these wicked tyrants they fear the fact that we are awake they fear the fact
[3:46:42.960 --> 3:46:48.840]  that we are alive they fear the fact that we love God and that's all we ever
[3:46:48.840 --> 3:46:53.160]  have to know is that God is in charge
[3:46:53.160 --> 3:47:00.000]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:47:05.240 --> 3:47:14.320]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones with mike adams
[3:47:14.320 --> 3:47:18.880]  we're talking about this new mini documentary that's available in band
[3:47:18.880 --> 3:47:24.240]  dot video racking up tens of thousands of views literally overnight one of the
[3:47:24.240 --> 3:47:26.920]  key things that everybody needs to understand here you're gonna hear a
[3:47:26.920 --> 3:47:33.280]  lot more about this term over the next few years it's called peroxy nitrites
[3:47:33.280 --> 3:47:40.480]  peroxy nitrites p-e-r-o-x-y followed by nitrites n-i-t-r-i-t-e-s peroxy
[3:47:40.480 --> 3:47:44.400]  nitrites these are the highly toxic molecules that are literally created
[3:47:44.400 --> 3:47:49.600]  inside your body and your blood when you're exposed to 5g electromagnetic
[3:47:49.600 --> 3:47:54.680]  radiation and these peroxy nitrites break down into highly reactive highly
[3:47:54.680 --> 3:47:59.160]  dangerous oxygen reactive species as well as nitrogen reactive species it's
[3:47:59.160 --> 3:48:03.960]  it's straightforward biochemistry by the way and these are extremely damaging
[3:48:03.960 --> 3:48:11.440]  substances and in effect the 5g system has created a binary weapon now this
[3:48:11.440 --> 3:48:16.600]  weapon system which I'm going to call now an electro nutritional chemo weapon
[3:48:16.600 --> 3:48:21.840]  or let's let's call it electro biochemical weapon system okay so the
[3:48:21.840 --> 3:48:27.480]  electromagnetic radiation from 5g combines with a nutritionally deficient
[3:48:27.480 --> 3:48:32.560]  state in a human being someone who is not taking supplements someone who's
[3:48:32.560 --> 3:48:37.480]  eating just junk food someone who's depleting their body of antioxidants and
[3:48:37.480 --> 3:48:42.400]  minerals someone who's living a junk food lifestyle those people are highly
[3:48:42.400 --> 3:48:46.580]  highly vulnerable to these peroxy nitrites which are created through 5g
[3:48:46.580 --> 3:48:51.520]  exposure so both of these conditions have to be true in order for your brain
[3:48:51.520 --> 3:48:57.600]  to be severely damaged by 5g exposure now we covered some of this in the 5g
[3:48:57.600 --> 3:49:02.520]  documentary that's up on band.video but I've done more research since then so
[3:49:02.520 --> 3:49:05.280]  some of what I'm saying here is not even in that documentary yet we're gonna do a
[3:49:05.280 --> 3:49:10.080]  follow-up documentary that describes the chemistry the biochemistry of what I'm
[3:49:10.080 --> 3:49:15.440]  going through right now the upshot the takeaway that you need to know and I beg
[3:49:15.440 --> 3:49:20.120]  you to listen and share this vital information is that if if you thought
[3:49:20.120 --> 3:49:25.640]  that nutrition was just I don't know an anti-aging solution or just something
[3:49:25.640 --> 3:49:29.600]  to make your skin look better or whatever whatever no nutrition now is
[3:49:29.600 --> 3:49:34.960]  survival against 5g and as they roll out 6g in the future and as they roll out
[3:49:34.960 --> 3:49:41.080]  you know the Internet of Things where you're gonna have 5g beams from billions
[3:49:41.080 --> 3:49:45.600]  of devices across America devices that you might wear in your clothing in your
[3:49:45.600 --> 3:49:50.140]  hats on your wrist on your belt I mean clothing is gonna be embedded with these
[3:49:50.140 --> 3:49:55.800]  5g broadcast devices what it means is your body is going to be absolutely
[3:49:55.800 --> 3:50:01.120]  saturated with 5g signals your body is going to be turned into a chemical
[3:50:01.120 --> 3:50:07.720]  weapon against itself I mean when I look in big context here I hear people talk
[3:50:07.720 --> 3:50:13.320]  about Soleimani and you know what's going on in Iran and the bombing of him
[3:50:13.320 --> 3:50:16.560]  the Hellfire missile strike and everything those people are so dangerous
[3:50:16.560 --> 3:50:21.200]  okay maybe so but you've got even bigger dangers right here in America it's
[3:50:21.200 --> 3:50:25.880]  called the 5g cell towers way bigger dangers right here in America because
[3:50:25.880 --> 3:50:29.920]  people are being poisoned every minute of every day that they're exposed to 5g
[3:50:29.920 --> 3:50:34.080]  and if they don't know that they need to eat healthier that they need to take
[3:50:34.080 --> 3:50:37.360]  supplements in order to protect themselves then I'm sorry they're gonna
[3:50:37.360 --> 3:50:41.600]  suffer severe brain damage and even Soleimani couldn't cause massive brain
[3:50:41.600 --> 3:50:46.160]  damage across America in the way that the telecommunications industry is doing
[3:50:46.160 --> 3:50:49.600]  and not even to mention the fluoride industry or the dental industry
[3:50:49.600 --> 3:50:55.480]  installing mercury oh and by the way in my research guess what I turned up two
[3:50:55.480 --> 3:51:01.600]  metals make the peroxy nitrites even worse two metals that if you have these
[3:51:01.600 --> 3:51:05.880]  metals in your blood your body can't create the proper enzymes to break down
[3:51:05.880 --> 3:51:11.040]  the peroxy nitrites and and neutralize them guess what metals those are take a
[3:51:11.040 --> 3:51:15.600]  guess one of them is mercury which is found in vaccines and another of those
[3:51:15.600 --> 3:51:20.360]  metals is aluminum which is found in many over-the-counter medications as well
[3:51:20.360 --> 3:51:25.000]  as vaccines as well as in some grocery items like baking soda for certain
[3:51:25.000 --> 3:51:29.880]  brands if you are eating aluminum and getting mercury exposure your body cannot
[3:51:29.880 --> 3:51:35.680]  defend you against the peroxy nitrites that are created by the 5g cell tower
[3:51:35.680 --> 3:51:41.040]  exposure you see how this gets complex but do you see how dangerous it is and
[3:51:41.040 --> 3:51:44.680]  I don't know of anybody else in America that's doing this research I don't know
[3:51:44.680 --> 3:51:48.160]  any other news network that's talking about this right now I haven't even had
[3:51:48.160 --> 3:51:50.920]  time to write this up on my website you're hearing it first right here on
[3:51:50.920 --> 3:51:56.120]  on infowars.com who else in this world has the platform and the knowledge and
[3:51:56.120 --> 3:51:59.840]  cares enough about humanity to bring you this news you know that's why your
[3:51:59.840 --> 3:52:03.400]  support is so crucial but I just I feel an urgent need to bring you this
[3:52:03.400 --> 3:52:07.240]  information you've got to get away from mercury exposure you've got to get away
[3:52:07.240 --> 3:52:11.800]  from aluminum exposure you've got to clean up your diet you've got to practice
[3:52:11.800 --> 3:52:16.240]  detox and by the way you know what the the two best ways to detox are drinking
[3:52:16.240 --> 3:52:21.320]  water and sweating so drink water and go take a walk you know drink water and
[3:52:21.320 --> 3:52:26.360]  exercise sweat people it's going to save your life in this case and then have
[3:52:26.360 --> 3:52:30.040]  good nutrition good food good supplements you know eat the fresh fruits and
[3:52:30.040 --> 3:52:33.040]  vegetables that are filled with all the pigments the colors the colors are
[3:52:33.040 --> 3:52:37.200]  medicine did you know that colors are actual medicine the lycopene in carrots
[3:52:37.200 --> 3:52:41.240]  the the proanthocyanidins and grape seeds if you eat grapes and they have
[3:52:41.240 --> 3:52:44.320]  seeds in them you should chew the seeds and swallow them because that's
[3:52:44.320 --> 3:52:49.000]  powerful cardiovascular medicine in the grape seeds you wonder why the grocery
[3:52:49.000 --> 3:52:52.240]  stores they want to sell you seedless grapes because they took the medicine out
[3:52:52.240 --> 3:52:56.560]  people you should eat the grape skins and the grape seeds I could just go on
[3:52:56.560 --> 3:53:01.120]  and on they've taken the nutrition out of the food in the grocery store while
[3:53:01.120 --> 3:53:06.480]  they're building a weapons network of 5g cell towers that's exposing you to this
[3:53:06.480 --> 3:53:11.000]  electromagnetic radiation that's turning your body into a chemical bomb factory
[3:53:11.000 --> 3:53:16.440]  that causing your body to carpet bomb itself with toxic molecules but the
[3:53:16.440 --> 3:53:20.560]  answers are all out there the answers are right in front of you it's in the
[3:53:20.560 --> 3:53:24.160]  grocery store it's in the supplements it's in the superfoods the answers are
[3:53:24.160 --> 3:53:27.080]  available to anyone who's just wise enough to take advantage of them and
[3:53:27.080 --> 3:53:31.040]  yeah I feel passionate about this because this is this is what I do I'm a food
[3:53:31.040 --> 3:53:34.680]  scientist you know I study nutrition I study these issues and I see that
[3:53:34.680 --> 3:53:38.520]  humanity is being harmed right here in America in a way that all the terrorists
[3:53:38.520 --> 3:53:42.840]  in Iran could never even dream of accomplishing they didn't poison the
[3:53:42.840 --> 3:53:47.440]  water supply but the fluoride pushers did you know Solomoni he didn't he didn't
[3:53:47.440 --> 3:53:50.560]  poison our children with toxic vaccines and send them to the hospital with
[3:53:50.560 --> 3:53:55.800]  febrile seizures and comas but the vaccine industry did that didn't they I
[3:53:55.800 --> 3:54:02.360]  mean you know look even if we kill 10,000 terrorists over in Iraq or Iran or
[3:54:02.360 --> 3:54:07.520]  Afghanistan or Syria we are still being poisoned to death right here in America
[3:54:07.520 --> 3:54:13.080]  and frankly when is Trump gonna take action here in America against these
[3:54:13.080 --> 3:54:17.720]  threats against us that's one of my big questions I I mean I'm just gonna say it
[3:54:17.720 --> 3:54:22.600]  I think that Trump needs to prioritize some of these domestic issues that are
[3:54:22.600 --> 3:54:26.560]  facing us like freedom of speech you know for example the First Amendment the
[3:54:26.560 --> 3:54:30.920]  Second Amendment under attack in Virginia and other places across America
[3:54:30.920 --> 3:54:34.720]  and we're all under attack from these 5g telecommunications networks that
[3:54:34.720 --> 3:54:38.400]  frankly seem to be well supported by the Trump administration right now I
[3:54:38.400 --> 3:54:43.240]  think Trump needs to be better informed about the risks that these pose to all
[3:54:43.240 --> 3:54:48.040]  of us all right let me take care of a couple other items here I do want to
[3:54:48.040 --> 3:54:52.840]  say that coming up January 20th this was absolutely crucial for those of you who
[3:54:52.840 --> 3:54:57.440]  are in Virginia or near Virginia the Virginia Citizens Defense League I
[3:54:57.440 --> 3:55:03.600]  think that's vcdl.org is of course hosting a lobby day and it's absolutely
[3:55:03.600 --> 3:55:08.080]  crucial that you join that effort that's January 20th in Virginia obviously in
[3:55:08.080 --> 3:55:12.280]  Richmond but also all around the state there you got to join that your Second
[3:55:12.280 --> 3:55:17.240]  Amendment rights are under severe attack from these Democrats another important
[3:55:17.240 --> 3:55:21.520]  point we've only got a couple minutes left here I hear people today saying oh
[3:55:21.520 --> 3:55:25.400]  the war is over Iran's backing down everything's fine the stock market's up
[3:55:25.400 --> 3:55:30.840]  I just want to issue some words of caution here first of all a rising bubble
[3:55:30.840 --> 3:55:35.480]  market is not equate to a good economy the fundamentals still aren't there
[3:55:35.480 --> 3:55:38.920]  you've heard Gerald Salenti and others talk about that so I'm not going to go
[3:55:38.920 --> 3:55:43.320]  into those details but don't mistake a rising bubble with a good economy yeah
[3:55:43.320 --> 3:55:47.760]  the economy is good in many ways but some fundamentals are really lacking when
[3:55:47.760 --> 3:55:51.720]  you look at these stock market evaluations secondly the other day the
[3:55:51.720 --> 3:55:55.560]  truckers a truckers transportation coalition I covered this at natural news
[3:55:55.560 --> 3:56:00.480]  they warned about a quote super supply chain crisis in America if things go
[3:56:00.480 --> 3:56:04.720]  bad if there are sleeper cells that attack cities if there is a loss of
[3:56:04.720 --> 3:56:09.480]  infrastructure to be able to transport goods in and out of American cities the
[3:56:09.480 --> 3:56:14.440]  truckers are not suicidal they're not going to drive into the cities and just
[3:56:14.440 --> 3:56:20.280]  get shot up by some insane antifa crowd or drive into a war zone truckers are
[3:56:20.280 --> 3:56:25.000]  actually very adaptive they're survivors they're street smart people I have a lot
[3:56:25.000 --> 3:56:29.360]  of respect for truckers and they are underappreciated in our country and if
[3:56:29.360 --> 3:56:33.080]  things go bad in the city truckers aren't going to bring you your food your
[3:56:33.080 --> 3:56:38.120]  medicine the fuel that powers your vehicles and I think it's way too early
[3:56:38.120 --> 3:56:41.400]  to say that that Iran's not going to strike back with sleeper cells across
[3:56:41.400 --> 3:56:45.080]  America they very well could and they could do it at any time this year and
[3:56:45.080 --> 3:56:49.120]  they have every incentive to do so because the more chaos they can cause in
[3:56:49.120 --> 3:56:53.480]  America the more likely they might be able to see Trump defeated in the 2020
[3:56:53.480 --> 3:56:59.320]  election Trump needs peace and calm and civility really to win re-election
[3:56:59.320 --> 3:57:04.000]  but all of Trump's enemies are trying to cause mass chaos and collapse and mayhem
[3:57:04.000 --> 3:57:09.040]  so keep all of that in mind take these warnings seriously I thank you for your
[3:57:09.040 --> 3:57:12.520]  support I thank you for your attention my name's Mike Adams the health ranger
[3:57:12.520 --> 3:57:17.640]  here finishing up the last hour on info wars calm today support this network the
[3:57:17.640 --> 3:57:22.200]  words of Alex Jones are crucial to share across America the survival of this
[3:57:22.200 --> 3:57:26.440]  network is crucial and we again are the only ones in America that are going to
[3:57:26.440 --> 3:57:30.160]  bring you the truth about 5g about sleeper cells about the history of what
[3:57:30.160 --> 3:57:34.280]  Barack Obama did we the independent media this is it we're the ones bringing
[3:57:34.280 --> 3:57:38.720]  you this so we greatly appreciate your support oh sure is up next on the
[3:57:38.720 --> 3:57:58.680]  war room stay tuned
