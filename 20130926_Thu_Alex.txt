[00:00.000 --> 00:12.100]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.100 --> 00:34.220]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:34.220 --> 00:44.180]  it's Thursday the 26th day of September 2013 we've got some really good news the
[00:44.180 --> 00:48.380]  entire fraud that is man-made global warming and the taxes they're
[00:48.380 --> 00:55.820]  promoting via the scare is in accelerated collapse now the cult is
[00:55.820 --> 01:00.380]  still moving forward with the implementation of their takeover of
[01:00.380 --> 01:04.580]  society but we are gaining the initiative Lord Monk will be joining us for
[01:04.580 --> 01:09.020]  30 minutes in the third hour I'll do a full fourth hour today of radio
[01:09.020 --> 01:15.780]  transmission as well with a special guest that is going to be in studio with us
[01:15.780 --> 01:23.180]  that I'll tell you a little bit more about later as well here now
[01:23.180 --> 01:27.940]  continuing ladies and gentlemen obviously the public is learning exactly
[01:27.940 --> 01:34.980]  what Obamacare means for them and the Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell
[01:34.980 --> 01:41.100]  came out and said look just let this get implemented and it's so horrible it
[01:41.100 --> 01:47.660]  will fail on its own accord and that's a school of thought that says let them do
[01:47.660 --> 01:53.500]  this and then get the blame for it this is designed to wreck the economy and
[01:53.500 --> 01:57.660]  wreck health care in this country even further and then Obama will be gone
[01:57.660 --> 02:01.940]  and the globalists don't care they'll have control of it they want control of
[02:01.940 --> 02:06.900]  your medical care and your medical decisions and that's why I don't think
[02:06.900 --> 02:10.700]  it's a good idea to let Obamacare become implemented even though people say
[02:10.700 --> 02:15.380]  well this will ruin the Democrats forever no it won't their followers do
[02:15.380 --> 02:19.940]  not care they feel like their winners we had a call from one of them yesterday
[02:19.940 --> 02:24.860]  and I could tell he was a social worker because of the power trip he was on
[02:24.860 --> 02:29.300]  because I've been to court cases and followed it as an investigative
[02:29.300 --> 02:34.460]  journalist back when I was mainly doing local news and I just learned how they
[02:34.460 --> 02:40.740]  act and how they they they never let you feel like you you have any value in
[02:40.740 --> 02:45.660]  what you say is real because they are delusional cult leaders not all of them
[02:45.660 --> 02:48.900]  some of them get into it for the right reasons and find out how bad it is and
[02:48.900 --> 02:52.580]  try to work in the system but I said your government worker aren't you after
[02:52.580 --> 02:55.020]  about 10 minutes talking to him and he said yeah but it's none of your business
[02:55.020 --> 03:03.380]  and I just said you're a social worker and he said yeah I am a social worker and
[03:03.380 --> 03:08.820]  I do that all the time with people I mean on the street I could tell if
[03:08.820 --> 03:13.180]  somebody's a cop how to uniform military I can tell what branch the
[03:13.180 --> 03:17.180]  military somebody's out of I can talk and look at a woman for about five
[03:17.180 --> 03:20.060]  minutes and how they talk and what they say and know almost everything about
[03:20.060 --> 03:30.140]  him it's really scary I'll be honest with you also know myself very well and I
[03:30.140 --> 03:36.620]  can tell you right now society is degenerating fast and going crazy a lot
[03:36.620 --> 03:39.660]  of people are waking up but that's how history happens you'll have the best
[03:39.660 --> 03:42.780]  stuff happening with the worst of happening people are going to get more
[03:42.780 --> 03:47.460]  conscious more awake more informed rewiring their brains to be more
[03:47.460 --> 03:51.500]  intelligent but the other group is rewiring their brain to be more dumb
[03:51.500 --> 03:55.980]  down more cynical more evil more corrupt because they subconsciously know
[03:55.980 --> 04:00.460]  the whole world's going over the edge but they can't admit to themselves
[04:00.460 --> 04:06.780]  consciously it's happening so they're going crazy they're going crazy right
[04:06.780 --> 04:12.540]  now and I'm from the perspective of a globalist but I'm not serving the
[04:12.540 --> 04:17.620]  globalist I know how people work instead of seeing people's failings and then
[04:17.620 --> 04:23.100]  feeling a leap over them it's horrific it's horrifying almost everyone are like
[04:23.100 --> 04:28.020]  children now I and I'm like in a world of like little with mentally retarded
[04:28.020 --> 04:33.060]  children all around me and I don't have some high view of myself and then I see
[04:33.060 --> 04:36.780]  the globalist who are conscious and operating and they are abusing the child
[04:36.780 --> 04:43.420]  like minds and then the children are petulant demonic themselves and it is
[04:43.420 --> 04:53.580]  just insane to see this type of stuff going on ladies and gentlemen we'll be

[10:57.780 --> 11:03.500]  routing of the global warming fraudsters as more documents come out even bigger
[11:03.500 --> 11:07.260]  than climate gate proving that they're in an organized operation with the
[11:07.260 --> 11:11.580]  Obama administration and the Merkel administration from Deutschland trying to
[11:11.580 --> 11:16.900]  suppress the evidence the earth has been radically cooling on average doesn't
[11:16.900 --> 11:20.380]  mean certain sub areas haven't gotten hotter or colder but radically colder
[11:20.380 --> 11:27.020]  last decade and cooling started again a decade ago but warming stopped 15 years
[11:27.020 --> 11:31.660]  ago and as part of a normal cycle are there real environmental crises you
[11:31.660 --> 11:36.660]  bet your boots there are and they ignore all of those so we're going to be
[11:36.660 --> 11:39.140]  talking to Lord Moncton for about 30 minutes in the third hour we'll do a

[12:02.060 --> 12:08.140]  to open the phones up in this hour specifically for Obamacare supporters we
[12:08.140 --> 12:13.420]  had one call in yesterday giggling and laughing and doing talking points from
[12:13.420 --> 12:17.580]  Tennessee and I ascertained he was a government worker instantly and then
[12:17.580 --> 12:22.540]  made one guess I said you're a social worker aren't you and of course he
[12:22.540 --> 12:27.220]  started stuttering and said yeah yeah I am I help people I said no what you do is
[12:27.220 --> 12:32.020]  the system destroys the jobs destroys the family destroys the culture and then
[12:32.020 --> 12:37.060]  sends you people out to basically take control of society social workers were
[12:37.060 --> 12:41.860]  set up in England about 150 years ago here in the US around a hundred years
[12:41.860 --> 12:46.180]  ago on record by the Rockefeller Foundation to go out and carry out
[12:46.180 --> 12:51.860]  race hygiene eugenics and I said what about the for sterilization what about
[12:51.860 --> 12:59.220]  giving black people syphilis and he just laughed at me and he is his accent
[12:59.220 --> 13:04.780]  he sounded a little bit like he was black to me and this was funny it doesn't
[13:04.780 --> 13:08.860]  matter the government's his buddy the government's in charge now the government
[13:08.860 --> 13:14.100]  is inherently run by evil people on the top on record who want to deindustrialize
[13:14.100 --> 13:18.540]  the public and domesticate us under cloward and piven the adopted official
[13:18.540 --> 13:23.580]  policy of the Democratic Party to bankrupt the country to make us dependent
[13:23.580 --> 13:29.700]  to make us dependent on them and he said I want socialism I do want socialism
[13:29.700 --> 13:33.580]  with health care that's right they're going to help people and see they're on
[13:33.580 --> 13:36.580]  a power trip because they're the ones that distributed they call the shots
[13:36.580 --> 13:40.500]  that that's we're in the social order they're the upper class they're the
[13:40.500 --> 13:44.500]  government and then they laugh at everyone else doesn't matter if you have
[13:44.500 --> 13:49.220]  160 IQ doesn't matter if you could speak five languages doesn't matter if you've
[13:49.220 --> 13:53.260]  been successful from your own research inventing things and running
[13:53.260 --> 14:00.140]  businesses and hiring hundreds of people they laugh at you and they know
[14:00.140 --> 14:04.540]  they've got the power structure on their side and and they know their time is
[14:04.540 --> 14:10.140]  here the bureaucracies the title tell squads the I'm God I'm God as the TSA
[14:10.140 --> 14:14.980]  says beating their breast on TV saying I have power I have power we ought to
[14:14.980 --> 14:19.420]  make a intro with TSA agents going crazy saying I'm God TSA agents banging
[14:19.420 --> 14:23.300]  their chest saying I have power I have power when we have all those videos and
[14:23.300 --> 14:28.420]  then cut the state police been in women over cars doing proctology exams you
[14:28.420 --> 14:36.100]  know just to show you how hardcore it all is because this has happened every
[14:36.100 --> 14:40.060]  other time in history it's happening again and I want to hear from Obama
[14:40.060 --> 14:46.060]  supporters who are getting the welfare who get the Obama phones who get the
[14:46.060 --> 14:49.860]  peachy jobs and then they recruit them out of the welfare system to become the
[14:49.860 --> 14:57.300]  bureaucrats they recruit foster kids tend to be in the CPS and then they come to
[14:57.300 --> 15:01.220]  your house your business your life and they look you in the eye and they let
[15:01.220 --> 15:06.580]  you know you work for me now is that clear and most Americans get on their
[15:06.580 --> 15:12.500]  knees before them and only encourage it so you mean not a freak that guy out
[15:12.500 --> 15:15.340]  that time and time again when these callers call in I can guess what they
[15:15.340 --> 15:20.380]  do who they are and even what division of something they're in because I know
[15:20.380 --> 15:26.300]  them I know them I mean it's like I can be in a restaurant I don't even follow
[15:26.300 --> 15:30.780]  NFL football and I can tell by the arrogance the way they're acting the
[15:30.780 --> 15:35.900]  steroid use the you know the the the camels hump they'll have on their back
[15:35.900 --> 15:40.260]  from steroid use all of it means easy I look at them and I'll go that guy's
[15:40.260 --> 15:44.540]  probably a lineman but he looks a little depressed now and brain damaged he
[15:44.540 --> 15:49.060]  probably been probably been out of the NFL for about five years he's probably
[15:49.060 --> 15:53.100]  39 years old and I'll walk over and go were you in the NFL he goes what are you
[15:53.100 --> 16:00.260]  a fan no I just were you in the NFL yeah you were a lineman yeah and mm-hmm mm-hmm
[16:00.260 --> 16:05.500]  and of course that's easy you can do that too but I mean I just know all the
[16:05.500 --> 16:08.540]  little types I know when someone's a software engineer that's got a hundred
[16:08.540 --> 16:11.460]  employees under them because the arrogance and the power trip they're on
[16:11.460 --> 16:14.580]  in the fact that they have intelligence twinkling in their eye but only an
[16:14.580 --> 16:17.460]  intelligence to work within the system and to feel like they're part of the
[16:17.460 --> 16:20.980]  power structure I mean I know I mean I can be there at the fourth as you lie
[16:20.980 --> 16:26.340]  on Lake Austin in a kayak a group of kayaks with my family and I could sit
[16:26.340 --> 16:31.100]  there behind the police line on the river where they block everybody watching
[16:31.100 --> 16:36.900]  all the people and I can tell that's a firefighter and his wife she works for
[16:36.900 --> 16:43.860]  the city that guy's a cop and because the way he's looking at everybody
[16:43.860 --> 16:47.300]  sardonic like they're scum and I'll say hey you're a you're a cop because what
[16:47.300 --> 16:50.580]  do I know you I don't know your cop what do you state police and the guys are
[16:50.580 --> 16:54.620]  freaking out how do you know that I'm walking to like SWAT team guys in
[16:54.620 --> 16:58.740]  Target and stuff and I go you're a SWAT team aren't you the guys like how do you
[16:58.740 --> 17:10.980]  know that cuz I know that's why I know you I see you because I'm alive and it's
[17:10.980 --> 17:15.500]  just really creepy to look at the politicians how blackmailed and slave
[17:15.500 --> 17:19.860]  people like Kerry are and you see Obama on a power trip arrogantly
[17:19.860 --> 17:24.340]  narcissistically just loving the red carpets and power you just see him as a
[17:24.340 --> 17:29.700]  pure you know demon low level just getting off on the power you see his
[17:29.700 --> 17:35.540]  wife who's crazy and hateful and dominant and there with the
[17:35.540 --> 17:40.940]  Jezebel spirit and you see people like Harry Reid who's really creepy and

[24:25.460 --> 24:28.940]  al Qaeda group to attack America and then no one will point out that our
[24:28.940 --> 24:34.780]  government's funding al Qaeda and obviously behind it and the rollout of
[24:34.780 --> 24:40.060]  the armored vehicles and TSA will only expand and cops walking around on
[24:40.060 --> 24:43.460]  delusional power trips they've reached their status there in the upper class

[24:47.240 --> 24:53.540]  al Qaeda groups the government publicly runs before I get to that and to the
[24:53.540 --> 24:59.500]  latest on Obamacare without further ado let's give out the number again for
[24:59.500 --> 25:05.340]  Obama supporters who support Obamacare and who think it's a loving government
[25:05.340 --> 25:10.500]  that really wants to help poor people now again you have the low-level useful
[25:10.500 --> 25:15.060]  idiots that actually believe redistribution is to help people and
[25:15.060 --> 25:18.380]  and it's been done over decades to give the power over society to the
[25:18.380 --> 25:22.540]  globalist now they've got almost total control and they're moving into the open
[25:22.540 --> 25:28.740]  eugenics phase and you have to understand the people that that buy into
[25:28.740 --> 25:34.260]  this they believe they're special because they're guys in office republicans do
[25:34.260 --> 25:37.780]  this as well when their people are in regardless of what the rhino stands for
[25:37.780 --> 25:42.580]  you notice the republican leadership and the democrats have been going after
[25:42.580 --> 25:47.340]  Ron Paul Rand Paul Ted Cruz and others because they understand they're the
[25:47.340 --> 25:52.380]  example of true Americana that could reverse this criminal takeover and it's
[25:52.380 --> 25:57.380]  all the big special interest all the big mega billionaires and Goldman Sachs and
[25:57.380 --> 26:03.020]  Berkshire Hathaway heads that promote the carbon taxes the taxes on the poor the
[26:03.020 --> 26:07.100]  Obamacare because it's all about a managed command and control system but
[26:07.100 --> 26:11.860]  all those are just words to the Obama supporter they call in and they laugh
[26:11.860 --> 26:19.660]  with pleasure David calls from Germany says he's a supporter of Obamacare so
[26:19.660 --> 26:26.760]  tell us tell tell me why I'm wrong go ahead I can't hear okay well we're
[26:26.760 --> 26:33.860]  sending the audio David go ahead mm-hmm hi Alex I'm a big fan just wanted to say
[26:33.860 --> 26:40.020]  first off I love your show I especially really love your coverage of Syria in
[26:40.020 --> 26:46.500]  terms of Obamacare I'm not really a huge Obama supporter but my problem is and
[26:46.500 --> 26:53.820]  the reason I support Obamacare is because we've got millions of Americans of
[26:53.820 --> 26:57.260]  course we all know the numbers from 50 million Americans in order to have
[26:57.260 --> 27:01.580]  insurance and a lot of these people like hundreds of thousands upon hundreds of
[27:01.580 --> 27:05.700]  thousands are going bankrupt just because of medical bills yeah and what I
[27:05.700 --> 27:11.540]  want is I want people no matter what their income is they're impoverished
[27:11.540 --> 27:15.540]  whether they're welfare I don't care I want them to be able to go to the doctor
[27:15.540 --> 27:20.980]  visit a doctor be able to get even just common medicines prescribed for their
[27:20.980 --> 27:26.300]  children if they're sick well this is incredible an actual thought-out thing
[27:26.300 --> 27:29.460]  not somebody on an arrogant power trip giggling because they think Obama's
[27:29.460 --> 27:33.780]  their buddy let me break something down for you if you read the 10,000 pages of
[27:33.780 --> 27:39.140]  amendments and if you've worked in health care over here or studied it you
[27:39.140 --> 27:43.420]  would understand that they're putting out that lie that 35 to 40 million or
[27:43.420 --> 27:47.500]  whatever it is don't have insurance that they don't get medical care that's not
[27:47.500 --> 27:55.620]  true there is not a hospital in the country that does not render care to
[27:55.620 --> 28:00.620]  people and there are drug programs to give people prescription drugs they
[28:00.620 --> 28:05.860]  will not tell you that if you're not an illegal alien or on welfare you're not
[28:05.860 --> 28:09.060]  told this the illegal aliens know it they go to the front of the line I've
[28:09.060 --> 28:12.500]  been at the hospital with insurance and watch the illegals going in in front of
[28:12.500 --> 28:17.820]  me because they don't even enroll them they know it's called charity care and
[28:17.820 --> 28:21.460]  hospitals under the regulations for hundreds of years are supposed to give
[28:21.460 --> 28:26.180]  a third of their care as charity care and then other financial charities
[28:26.180 --> 28:31.820]  businesses are supposed to give money to pay for the prosthesis or for
[28:31.820 --> 28:36.900]  equipment and things like that you know my dad when he went to dental school they
[28:36.900 --> 28:39.620]  were told you're supposed to give about a third of your health care discounted or
[28:39.620 --> 28:44.580]  free now what Obama care does is it gets rid of that it's written by the
[28:44.580 --> 28:48.780]  insurance companies while their stock went up in some cases more than 50% but
[28:48.780 --> 28:54.540]  overall more than 15% when Obamacare got passed because they wrote it and it
[28:54.540 --> 28:59.820]  allows them to give a lesser standard of care while increasing the premiums and
[28:59.820 --> 29:05.780]  the cost of overall insurance and so the argument that hey our hospitals are
[29:05.780 --> 29:08.940]  going bankrupt because so many people come in that don't have insurance make
[29:08.940 --> 29:16.100]  make people get insurance yes it will make many blue-collar people go out and
[29:16.100 --> 29:19.780]  get it but it's gonna end up bankrupting it's also designed to create a
[29:19.780 --> 29:24.340]  permanent peasant class and drive down wages because because everyone's got to
[29:24.340 --> 29:28.300]  work less than 40 hours a week so I appreciate your call we heard your
[29:28.300 --> 29:32.460]  points maybe Mitch McConnell's right maybe let's let this thing get implemented
[29:32.460 --> 29:36.500]  the problem is it's meant to bankrupt the old system then they'll go pure
[29:36.500 --> 29:41.860]  socialist as the answer to the crisis they've already created I'm Alex Jones

[33:40.820 --> 33:50.380]  from them why Obamacare is not a good good idea or is a good idea my
[33:50.380 --> 33:55.700]  specifically want to hear why I'm wrong now I know I'm right I know it was
[33:55.700 --> 33:58.740]  written by the big globalist to get control of health care it was meant as
[33:58.740 --> 34:03.340]  a corporate tax through government directly to the big mega banks that
[34:03.340 --> 34:06.980]  have gotten tens of trillions and banker bailouts you name it I know the
[34:06.980 --> 34:11.340]  Republican Party leadership 15 years ago with the insurance companies in
[34:11.340 --> 34:17.060]  consultation with the head of the Senate Tom Dashel at the time wrote this
[34:17.060 --> 34:23.900]  thing I mean that's the history of it and it penalizes blue-collar workers it
[34:23.900 --> 34:31.780]  gets rid of charity care and it basically forces the general public to go out
[34:31.780 --> 34:36.500]  and get the insurance and when you do that it makes the commodity go up in
[34:36.500 --> 34:45.220]  price when it's a rigged system and that's why even before implementation
[34:45.220 --> 34:53.060]  Bloomberg itself reports a 59% national increase in premiums in the last two
[34:53.060 --> 34:58.460]  years they're set to go up on average over 150 percent for men and 80 plus
[34:58.460 --> 35:02.340]  percent for women national average that's projected by the National
[35:02.340 --> 35:11.100]  Insurance Council and it's it's it's it's the new order model where you pay a
[35:11.100 --> 35:17.300]  carbon tax and it goes to oil companies that set up the carbon exchange it goes
[35:17.300 --> 35:24.540]  to Al Gore it goes to his trading company in London gore and blood I'm not
[35:24.540 --> 35:30.620]  joking his partners name blood it's that I'm not joking it's gore and blood not
[35:30.620 --> 35:36.180]  blood and gore but it gore and blood there's the Chicago mercantile that a
[35:36.180 --> 35:41.300]  small holder of it compared to Warren Buffett is Obama just like old just like
[35:41.300 --> 35:50.460]  Warren Buffett is the biggest recipient on record Warren Buffett is the biggest
[35:50.460 --> 36:03.940]  recipient on record on record of the banker bailout and they're going to
[36:03.940 --> 36:08.380]  continue to be the biggest recipients that's why they're billionaires it's why
[36:08.380 --> 36:12.260]  they're in control it's why their tax exempt it's why they're offshore it's
[36:12.260 --> 36:15.860]  why they're exempt from Obamacare because they're gangsters and they run the
[36:15.860 --> 36:21.900]  show and they know how to lie to chumps and you hear a well-meaning guy from
[36:21.900 --> 36:27.100]  Germany who likes the show because we're anti-war with Syria and you know knows a
[36:27.100 --> 36:32.180]  lot of what we're saying is true and he calls in and says but I think poor people
[36:32.180 --> 36:37.060]  should be able to go in and get health care we've had dr. Blalock on we've had
[36:37.060 --> 36:41.300]  my dad on we've had countless other physicians on who will explain to you
[36:41.300 --> 36:50.940]  what I grew up watching poor people coming in and getting free health care
[36:50.940 --> 36:57.260]  and then you dentist offices clinics hospitals would reach out and get local
[36:57.260 --> 37:02.580]  community sponsorship from churches and corporations and individuals to have a
[37:02.580 --> 37:07.300]  fund for the poor to pay for an artificial leg or to pay for a heart
[37:07.300 --> 37:11.740]  stent or to pay and I try to explain this to Obama supporters and they just
[37:11.740 --> 37:15.740]  don't get it I have a good friend who had Crohn's disease and worked for a local
[37:15.740 --> 37:20.340]  TV station making pretty good living a year for somebody working at a TV
[37:20.340 --> 37:24.820]  station you know like 60 grand a year but they couldn't get health insurance
[37:24.820 --> 37:30.060]  this is like 10 years ago and I went to them because they couldn't do video
[37:30.060 --> 37:34.620]  editing for me and they're part-time at their separate business they had a
[37:34.620 --> 37:40.140]  business office other than their other operation and the person when I got there
[37:40.140 --> 37:42.780]  was crawling around the floor and losing weight look what they were gonna
[37:42.780 --> 37:48.300]  die soon and had been to all the specialists in Texas and who had been
[37:48.300 --> 37:53.300]  kicked off their insurance for the company they worked with and who couldn't
[37:53.300 --> 37:59.300]  get insurance and couldn't couldn't pay for the drugs and I said listen there's
[37:59.300 --> 38:03.380]  a drug program to give you that remicade that just shuts down your immune
[38:03.380 --> 38:06.700]  system that's not what you really need you to get off GMO and I'll drink as much
[38:06.700 --> 38:10.180]  coffee I went and looked up Crohn's I knew it was vaccine induced from measles
[38:10.180 --> 38:13.060]  shot he goes yeah I got measles shot when I was a kid and actually that's one
[38:13.060 --> 38:17.300]  sort of getting sick about a year after my mom thought that and he didn't believe
[38:17.300 --> 38:21.140]  me I said listen you got to go to the hospital and say I've been refused
[38:21.140 --> 38:26.540]  insurance and here's what I make and sign a deal with them to agree on a
[38:26.540 --> 38:30.860]  payment plan for a percentage but to be given charity care rates ended up all
[38:30.860 --> 38:34.660]  being paid for ended up going to New York getting the top specialist in the
[38:34.660 --> 38:40.700]  country to remove part of his intestines and he's 98% better and doesn't have as
[38:40.700 --> 38:46.420]  much as many problems very rare now a decade later he actually got an argument
[38:46.420 --> 38:50.700]  with me and he said you're a liar he said I'm dying and you're in here
[38:50.700 --> 38:53.540]  telling me there's charity care and they'll do this surgery and I can get the
[38:53.540 --> 38:58.100]  drugs and all of it for free when when I've been cut from full-time to part-time
[38:58.100 --> 39:02.060]  at the TV station so that I'm a contractor and I've lost my insurance
[39:02.060 --> 39:06.140]  and my Cobra ran out and you're telling me it's free I've been to the hospital
[39:06.140 --> 39:10.500]  there and I go that's because they know you're a working person I said you can
[39:10.500 --> 39:13.580]  quit everything go on welfare they'll admit their charity care they're lying
[39:13.580 --> 39:17.740]  to you they've been told to lie to you because Americans are seen as the con
[39:17.740 --> 39:24.020]  artist Mark he finally went I gave him the paperwork he discovered it all had
[39:24.020 --> 39:30.900]  the surgery for free top surgeon in the country who admitted of course I do one
[39:30.900 --> 39:37.620]  third of my care for free that's what a physician supposed to do now the
[39:37.620 --> 39:40.940]  physicians aren't going to have to do that anymore there's not going to be in
[39:40.940 --> 39:45.580]  all these tax exempt hospitals that really make profits their profits are
[39:45.580 --> 39:50.900]  going to go up that's why their stocks up and you people do not want to
[39:50.900 --> 39:54.740]  understand this you do not want to know this you love wallowing and ignorance
[39:54.740 --> 40:02.740]  at least the guy earlier at least the fella earlier called in and bought their
[40:02.740 --> 40:07.540]  lie and thought it was to help people that run a shirt it's not true my finger
[40:07.540 --> 40:12.700]  was dangling by a piece of skin severed with the bone sticking out and I walked
[40:12.700 --> 40:19.140]  into the downtown city hospital and said here's my Blue Cross Blue Shield of
[40:19.140 --> 40:24.060]  Minnesota insurance to the Genesis Network I said here it is it covers
[40:24.060 --> 40:28.340]  90% and here's my credit cards and they said go sit over there an hour and a
[40:28.340 --> 40:32.660]  half later my dad gets there he goes you you're gonna lose that finger I have to
[40:32.660 --> 40:36.380]  walk up calmly cut in front of all the illegal aliens literally who were just
[40:36.380 --> 40:39.460]  going straight in because they know they don't have insurance they know they go
[40:39.460 --> 40:44.740]  charity care in Spanish boom baby and I had insurance I was a scum American it
[40:44.740 --> 40:48.500]  had to be run looked at double checked they were going to decide how to rip me
[40:48.500 --> 40:53.420]  off if you're on charity care rattlesnake anti-venom is about a hundred
[40:53.420 --> 41:00.540]  dollars on record if you are wealthy and known to have gold plated insurance
[41:00.540 --> 41:05.620]  you're going to be charged 100 plus thousand dollars per injection on record
[41:05.620 --> 41:13.420]  tapping a good friend of mine's mother the total bill is almost 300 grand it is
[41:13.420 --> 41:19.500]  healthcare is criminally run by offshore mega bank mafias that sit there and run
[41:19.500 --> 41:23.220]  an actuary and the insurance department's got a look at it while you're
[41:23.220 --> 41:28.300]  bleeding and I finally walked up and I said and I wouldn't even that well known
[41:28.300 --> 41:32.300]  12 years ago or so when I cut my finger off but they knew who I was and I said
[41:32.300 --> 41:37.780]  I'm gonna sue you I said I want I know the surgeons here I said all these people
[41:37.780 --> 41:40.620]  with stomach aches and the rest of it that are here to just get their you
[41:40.620 --> 41:43.500]  know their pain pills or whatever I said I know what's going on it's a bunch of
[41:43.500 --> 41:47.860]  pill heads right here I said I'm gonna sue you when I came in here and you
[41:47.860 --> 41:51.140]  didn't attach my finger and I lost it this is what my hand wrapped up with
[41:51.140 --> 41:57.340]  blood dripping I said you see that I said you get the surgeon prepped and you
[41:57.340 --> 42:03.420]  get it reattached right now I'm gonna sue you personally they had me in there
[42:03.420 --> 42:08.860]  in 10 minutes then she comes in and she goes yeah I'm a listener yours and they
[42:08.860 --> 42:12.380]  actually called me in because they thought I'd be better at this and you
[42:12.380 --> 42:14.580]  know the other surgeons are taking care of these people and she said I'm gonna
[42:14.580 --> 42:17.580]  give you a tetanus shot and I said no you're not I said this thing is bled all
[42:17.580 --> 42:22.180]  over the place I got tetanus shots are known one of their main bio weapons they
[42:22.180 --> 42:27.340]  add the hormones the chemicals to create a autoimmune response to that she said
[42:27.340 --> 42:30.660]  yeah I've seen that literature she said I want you to sign a waiver I said I
[42:30.660 --> 42:33.900]  need to sign a waiver I'm on record for everybody right here so she spent 20
[42:33.900 --> 42:37.380]  minutes scrubbing it all out putting eye-dye on it getting into it doing
[42:37.380 --> 42:43.020]  everything and she reattached my finger and it was really cool for a few years I
[42:43.020 --> 42:46.220]  had no feeling it's actually come back almost the entire finger what an
[42:46.220 --> 42:50.740]  amazing body God gave us grown back over the 12 years where it's not even numb
[42:50.740 --> 42:56.820]  anymore realize the last few years it came back and that's what I had to do
[42:56.820 --> 43:02.900]  in America to get in there and get the health care okay now I'm gonna come back
[43:02.900 --> 43:12.660]  from break and I'm going to go to your phone calls for about 20 minutes of the
[43:12.660 --> 43:15.860]  next hour they have a special guest in studio one of you fellas do me a
[43:15.860 --> 43:18.820]  favor those two bottles right there on the back will you come and give me those
[43:18.820 --> 43:22.660]  right there just the two on the back right there thanks a lot appreciate that
[43:22.660 --> 43:28.260]  bro thank you so much I shot a video last night we're gonna premiere here on
[43:28.260 --> 43:35.700]  the radio I'm gonna talk about it some afterwards here in just a moment
[43:35.700 --> 43:41.820]  dealing with the magic of iodine particularly a certain type of iodine
[43:41.820 --> 43:46.220]  because as they take over with the eugenics health care and block access
[43:46.220 --> 43:49.860]  to traditional MD medicine it's gonna be more important that all of us get in
[43:49.860 --> 43:54.020]  shape it's psychologically in shape it's spiritually in shape and also learn
[43:54.020 --> 43:58.620]  about the things that they don't want us to understand like nation iodine so
[43:58.620 --> 44:02.140]  here's a breakdown on the radiation levels it's actually more than double
[44:02.140 --> 44:05.180]  the northern hemisphere right now what it was 60 years ago but here's a
[44:05.180 --> 44:29.580]  special report on that Alex Jones here to warn you about some of the most
[44:29.580 --> 44:35.620]  important health information you may ever hear I'm talking about radiation
[44:35.620 --> 44:40.980]  radioactive fallout radioactive particles contaminating the northern
[44:40.980 --> 44:47.820]  hemisphere conservatively since the 1940s the northern hemisphere of our planet
[44:47.820 --> 44:53.220]  has more than doubled its background radiation in fact that was before
[44:53.220 --> 44:58.380]  Fukushima exploded now the levels are going up and up and up fish are
[44:58.380 --> 45:03.860]  contaminated in the Pacific and the FDA the EPA and others they're not worried
[45:03.860 --> 45:08.100]  about it they've been raising the levels of what they claim is safe radioactive
[45:08.100 --> 45:13.220]  particles well I began to discuss with my wife protecting myself her and of
[45:13.220 --> 45:18.100]  course our children most importantly I have three small children ages 10 9 and
[45:18.100 --> 45:23.180]  5 radiation really affects children more than adults because they have fast
[45:23.180 --> 45:27.660]  growing cells all literature is clear on that and I went and talked to medical
[45:27.660 --> 45:32.020]  doctors scientists nuclear physicists nutritionists and I said what's the
[45:32.020 --> 45:36.620]  number one thing I could do to protect my family and they said Alex it's leave
[45:36.620 --> 45:41.500]  the northern hemisphere go south of the equator that's where the radiation levels
[45:41.500 --> 45:46.420]  are very very low if you look at the wind patterns the north hardly interacts
[45:46.420 --> 45:51.060]  with the south and it's unfortunate that we've done this to our planet so after
[45:51.060 --> 45:56.180]  more than two years of research into how to protect my family looking at all the
[45:56.180 --> 46:01.620]  literature talking to the experts across the board they agreed iodine is key but
[46:01.620 --> 46:09.060]  of the family of iodine nascent natural non-gmo non-factory iodine that comes
[46:09.060 --> 46:15.540]  from the earth is absolutely paramount for your thyroid and other functions in
[46:15.540 --> 46:20.460]  the body the literature the research it's there it's not my opinion it is
[46:20.460 --> 46:25.740]  admitted that iodine is essential for the health of our bodies overall and
[46:25.740 --> 46:30.260]  nascent iodine is the best form now we're announcing the launch of info wars
[46:30.260 --> 46:34.180]  life comm we're gonna bring you scores of products over the next few years that
[46:34.180 --> 46:39.060]  we're researching and developing but nascent iodine is the first product we're
[46:39.060 --> 46:44.300]  coming out with because it's so important and it's also listed as a fluoride
[46:44.300 --> 46:49.420]  detox or it does so many other things your body needs it and when you don't
[46:49.420 --> 46:54.220]  have enough iodine forget the radiation your thyroid absorbs the sodium fluoride
[46:54.220 --> 46:58.740]  and other things and it's the good iodine the nascent iodine that is able to
[46:58.740 --> 47:03.180]  block that and just do so many things for your body and your health I've been
[47:03.180 --> 47:07.180]  taking it it's amazing it's a lot better than coffee I'm here to tell you and

[48:14.780 --> 48:19.220]  probably the most important point you don't just take nascent iodine when
[48:19.220 --> 48:23.740]  disaster strikes when there's some new giant disaster the northern hemisphere
[48:23.740 --> 48:27.900]  is already double what it was 60 years ago with the radioactive background I
[48:27.900 --> 48:32.300]  believe from the research I've done and the experts I've talked to it is key to
[48:32.300 --> 48:37.100]  take nascent iodine to protect your thyroid from the radiological disaster
[48:37.100 --> 48:41.180]  that's already happened and unfortunately future disasters that will happen
[48:41.180 --> 48:46.160]  that's why it's important to fill your thyroid up now with the healthy nascent
[48:46.160 --> 48:51.300]  iodine so that the sodium fluoride the radioactive isotopes and the rest of it
[48:51.300 --> 48:56.580]  can't get in that's the key this is something that across the board has been
[48:56.580 --> 49:01.580]  shown in study after study to be an absolutely essential nutrient in the
[49:01.580 --> 49:06.020]  body until a few decades ago the government put it in the salt because
[49:06.020 --> 49:08.980]  they knew you needed it but then they took that out that's good with the
[49:08.980 --> 49:14.100]  thyroid and put the sodium fluoride in that's bad for it talk about eugenics
[49:14.100 --> 49:19.820]  talk about soft kill talk about a invisible weapon in the water supply this
[49:19.820 --> 49:25.060]  stuff is on record as a detoxifier for the fluoride they're adding to our water

[54:13.140 --> 54:29.180]  all right let's go to your phone calls into the next hour from Obama supporters
[54:29.180 --> 54:34.460]  who think Obamacare is a great deal I start doing my own filibuster when I
[54:34.460 --> 54:38.340]  start thinking about it how bad it is how evil it is how it cons people how
[54:38.340 --> 54:41.100]  everything else Obama and the globalists have done has been about
[54:41.100 --> 54:46.580]  domesticating you bankrupting you to enslaving you and then how these people
[54:46.580 --> 54:50.220]  gullibly really think they're gonna get something free meanwhile the whole
[54:50.220 --> 54:55.140]  country is going bankrupt Europe's going bankrupt into the hands of the globalists
[54:55.140 --> 55:02.300]  that engineered this let's go to Jeremiah in Oklahoma Jeremiah you're on the
[55:02.300 --> 55:12.220]  air go ahead I work in healthcare and I'm at the point now where I just want
[55:12.220 --> 55:17.620]  Obamacare to get through because once it's fully implemented and this country
[55:17.620 --> 55:21.700]  really does start to go bankrupt maybe that'll wake everyone up okay so you're
[55:21.700 --> 55:26.860]  not an Obama you're not an Obamacare supporter you you see but look they know
[55:26.860 --> 55:30.380]  it's going to bankrupt things it's designed to their answer will be pure
[55:30.380 --> 55:35.300]  socialism don't you understand that they're their supporters every time they
[55:35.300 --> 55:40.460]  get conned they they double down it's like when you lose at the casino the
[55:40.460 --> 55:45.300]  loser degenerate gambler goes and mortgages their house you understand
[55:45.300 --> 55:50.300]  that everyone I work with is all for it they're all for it and it just needs to
[55:50.300 --> 55:54.300]  come because that will wake everyone up we just need to face the truth on this
[55:54.300 --> 55:59.420]  healthcare front on every front Alex I mean you knew yesterday with Ted Cruz in
[55:59.420 --> 56:03.820]  Congress can you honestly tell your listeners that Congress still has power
[56:03.820 --> 56:09.780]  in this captured country that we live in I just we need to face the pain and I
[56:09.780 --> 56:14.500]  think Obamacare is coming no matter what and everyone I work with they're all
[56:14.500 --> 56:18.060]  for it so you know what let it come maybe that'll wake this country up well
[56:18.060 --> 56:22.520]  they're obviously idiots then because Obamacare has been the first part of
[56:22.520 --> 56:27.740]  it's been in place for a year increasing payroll tax on everybody it'll
[56:27.740 --> 56:33.900]  fully be implemented January 1st 2015 I think January 1st 2014 that's when it'll
[56:33.900 --> 56:37.380]  start but it won't be fully implemented till 20 yeah well that's the biggest
[56:37.380 --> 56:39.860]  tale-tale thing and I appreciate your call sir but you're not really an
[56:39.860 --> 56:49.300]  Obama supporter I want serious Obama supporters here folks please that's why
[56:49.300 --> 56:54.460]  they keep pushing off implementation because this current crop does not want
[56:54.460 --> 56:57.940]  to be in when it goes in because they know it was written by foreign banks
[56:57.940 --> 57:04.300]  that paid for them the puppets don't even want this in yet it's kind of like
[57:04.300 --> 57:07.020]  they're gonna throw us off the plank but they don't want to be the ones that do
[57:07.020 --> 57:12.460]  it oh man I tell you I really feel sorry for these people Steve in Illinois you
[57:12.460 --> 57:16.500]  say you're an Obama supporter go ahead well I don't know about the Obama
[57:16.500 --> 57:21.140]  supporter but I'm a supporter of a universal healthcare a long time
[57:21.140 --> 57:24.660]  listener Alex I think you know who I am yeah you're McGrath the crime dog
[57:24.660 --> 57:30.260]  listening on 15 30 a.m. WCKG yes how did you know it's better than being
[57:30.260 --> 57:36.500]  McCain and listening out to radio Jane Hanoi but the story being I was in the
[57:36.500 --> 57:41.060]  welfare office last week because I'm 59 years old 11 months and in two weeks
[57:41.060 --> 57:45.020]  I'll be 60 and the majority of people get in the welfare this is in a black
[57:45.020 --> 57:49.580]  area Melrose Park our Mexicans they're the ones getting it you would think I
[57:49.580 --> 57:54.020]  would be fighting elbow to elbow with blacks but it wasn't true it's it's the
[57:54.020 --> 57:59.140]  illegals coming in they were Mexicans they were not blind haired well you know
[57:59.140 --> 58:02.340]  why the government selectively gives the illegals the most welfare that's on
[58:02.340 --> 58:06.380]  record they've had AP articles where the banks say we give you know folks loans
[58:06.380 --> 58:10.060]  for houses with no proof because we want to have an incentive to come here the
[58:10.060 --> 58:15.220]  corporations want cheap labor so these are these are these are covert secret
[58:15.220 --> 58:22.500]  war incentives to drive down the lages exactly true and I think that maybe this
[58:22.500 --> 58:26.820]  would help with the drug gouging that's going on you you get the prices the same
[58:26.820 --> 58:31.420]  drugs in Canada there they're one half the price they are in America so if it
[58:31.420 --> 58:34.100]  cuts the prices and I go and I pay for the $4.00
[58:34.100 --> 58:45.220]  but see it's all selectively enforced you're not this is GCN the Genesis

[01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:12.220]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:19.740]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.740 --> 01:00:23.220]  Alex Jones
[01:00:27.300 --> 01:00:32.900]  all right so we've actually gotten some pretty sensible calls in support of
[01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:40.340]  Obamacare and by sensible it's all like the government bureaucrat social worker
[01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:44.180]  that called in laughing at me yesterday on a power trip these are poor people
[01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:47.700]  saying look the illegals are already getting it everybody else is already
[01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:52.300]  getting it I want some and another guy calls in and says I want poor people to
[01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:55.500]  go into a hospital and get health care they already can just nobody tells them
[01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:59.860]  that it's called charity care now they're getting rid of that this is
[01:00:59.860 --> 01:01:05.060]  about multinational combine of banks owning insurance companies taking
[01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:10.340]  control of the health care system in this country to decide what treatments you
[01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:16.260]  can get even more and to make 35 to 40 million people buy insurance which drives
[01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:21.660]  up the overall price but yeah if you're on straight-up welfare short term this
[01:01:21.660 --> 01:01:24.540]  is going to be a good deal for you they've already gotten rid of your job
[01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:29.740]  shut down the country what else do you have the problem is it brings in the
[01:01:29.740 --> 01:01:33.660]  death panels then and the control just like the VA they don't give you surgery
[01:01:33.660 --> 01:01:38.700]  if you need it they give you pills so but the folks won't know the difference so
[01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:43.460]  you know it's kind of going into the long dark night the eugenics thing a lot
[01:01:43.460 --> 01:01:46.500]  of you are just going to be happy when they find and release the main bio weapon
[01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:50.620]  and they kill you and I understand it's sad and the globalist kind of create a
[01:01:50.620 --> 01:01:54.380]  self-fulfilling prophecy where they dumb everybody down and break up the family
[01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:59.780]  and create indoctrination systems instead of educational systems and we're
[01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:02.820]  under scientific attack and the globalist argue hey we're in control
[01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:07.020]  because we're smart and the public are done animals who need to be killed and
[01:02:07.020 --> 01:02:12.500]  the public says yes kill me so there you go it's kind of how it works let's go
[01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:16.900]  ahead and talk to Brian in New York you're an Obama supporter go ahead hello
[01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:22.540]  Alex I support Obamacare because it's going to give everybody free health
[01:02:22.540 --> 01:02:30.780]  care okay tell me how well I mean if the Republicans just move and let Obama do
[01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:37.260]  his job I mean we're gonna get free health care so how much free stuff you
[01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:45.540]  getting already Brian tons of free stuff I mean it says free everything free
[01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:51.380]  condoms just everything is just free for me it's not free I'll make it free do
[01:02:51.380 --> 01:02:56.740]  you think the globalist are doing this because they love you I think Obama is
[01:02:56.740 --> 01:03:00.620]  doing it because he loves us as a collective he even loves you he's our
[01:03:00.620 --> 01:03:12.700]  father he's our fewer you're being sarcastic right yeah oh man we're in
[01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:17.060]  trouble they've got it all figured out shut the economy down and pretty much a
[01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:20.900]  lot of people have to go on welfare I know a lot of veterans and people that
[01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:25.220]  are you know 55 years old can't get a job to pay their bills have a back
[01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:28.980]  problem and they go on welfare but then the government has full control of their
[01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:35.180]  life and make some take vaccines to get it where do you see all this going well
[01:03:35.180 --> 01:03:41.940]  you know doesn't really matter I mean I mean what I mean how many years do you
[01:03:41.940 --> 01:03:46.820]  think we have until this economic collapse comes and people finally wake up
[01:03:46.820 --> 01:03:52.420]  as a collective oh I think the economic collapse has already happened to a
[01:03:52.420 --> 01:03:56.060]  certain extent but I think it's gonna get real bad the next two years and but
[01:03:56.060 --> 01:03:59.060]  the problem is government will be there the whole time acting like it's trying
[01:03:59.060 --> 01:04:02.700]  to fix it when it's a hundred percent captured federal government that's
[01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:07.700]  about 98 percent captured I mean we could legitimately through constitutional
[01:04:07.700 --> 01:04:13.580]  ideas try to restore the Republic but they've been so smart about ruining the
[01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:18.820]  culture that it's I tell you we're in a lot of trouble that's all I can say yeah
[01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:23.500]  I mean but it is a thing I don't understand like when it comes to the
[01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:27.580]  government and the history I really can't understand this I mean I'm not a
[01:04:27.580 --> 01:04:33.340]  bright guy you know I mean I mean I'm not the smartest guy in the world I'm
[01:04:33.340 --> 01:04:37.580]  sure you are go ahead what's your point I understand history I understand what
[01:04:37.580 --> 01:04:42.860]  history is and if we see government doing the same things over and over again
[01:04:42.860 --> 01:04:47.380]  to kill people how could people just openly support this guy and in the
[01:04:47.380 --> 01:04:51.180]  White House I mean we outnumber them we have numbers on them they just have
[01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:55.700]  well that's because people forget what happened to the last generation I mean
[01:04:55.700 --> 01:05:01.100]  an animal going up to get some food that now there's a trap there why does the
[01:05:01.100 --> 01:05:04.700]  United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on
[01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:08.860]  health care why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet the highest
[01:05:08.860 --> 01:05:15.180]  rates of diabetes autism and every other major disease it all comes down to one
[01:05:15.180 --> 01:05:20.620]  thing we are what we eat our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with

[01:09:45.340 --> 01:09:50.020]  cycle they could care less about the environment care less about the earth so
[01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:53.500]  that's coming up and we're gonna have a special guest in studio with us a little
[01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:57.980]  bit in the next hour and then we're gonna be joined by Lord Moncton on the big
[01:09:57.980 --> 01:10:02.460]  climate change news as their whole fraudulent system implodes here's some
[01:10:02.460 --> 01:10:08.260]  of the news up on info wars dot com TSA to roll out covert surveillance vans
[01:10:08.260 --> 01:10:13.420]  details of snooping technology kept secret and see photos of the vans and
[01:10:13.420 --> 01:10:17.860]  homeland security in the rest of this is all breaking at info wars dot com and
[01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:24.620]  prison planet dot com by the way Intel's inside core i5 v pro this is their
[01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:30.180]  promotional video we're breaking it in the news but three days ago Rob do said
[01:10:30.180 --> 01:10:35.540]  have you seen the a listener sent us to the the Intel website where they're
[01:10:35.540 --> 01:10:39.940]  promoting the chips will control your life for the government and I went and
[01:10:39.940 --> 01:10:43.300]  watched it and I turned to tell Watson that was Sunday I guess I saw that turned
[01:10:43.300 --> 01:10:46.740]  on Watson do a story on this do a story on this do a story on this and so now
[01:10:46.740 --> 01:10:50.980]  it's Thursday and he did do a story on it Watson just does so much this got
[01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:54.780]  maybe it was Monday actually was three or four days ago the point is is that
[01:10:54.780 --> 01:11:00.700]  that story is up on info wars dot com completely hiding in plain view in
[01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:09.900]  front of everyone in front of everyone in everyone's face continuing with
[01:11:09.900 --> 01:11:13.740]  Obamacare that we're going to Obamacare as supporters calling in Obama on
[01:11:13.740 --> 01:11:17.860]  Obamacare quote we did raise taxes on some things and it is a tax and it did
[01:11:17.860 --> 01:11:20.860]  raise payroll taxes he broke his promise but that's okay
[01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:24.940]  Californians will pay 10th highest rates in the country under health exchange
[01:11:24.940 --> 01:11:29.620]  that's the San Jose Mercury news admitting massive increases in your free
[01:11:29.620 --> 01:11:33.660]  health care and of course the debt limit being raised doesn't raise the debt
[01:11:33.660 --> 01:11:42.540]  of course it does so what exchanges may have high out-of-pocket cost and we've
[01:11:42.540 --> 01:11:48.660]  got that report right there continuing Obama's 3,000 health law premiums test
[01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:52.220]  limits of affordability Bloomberg says people aren't liking that they're
[01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:55.500]  getting you ready now they're telling you you know we said this wouldn't hurt
[01:11:55.500 --> 01:12:00.460]  it's gonna hurt but big foreign banks wrote this because they care about you
[01:12:00.460 --> 01:12:03.820]  really when you were in control of Iraq you killed millions and shut off their
[01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:10.300]  power and water and medicine under a 1021 it's like but we love you but
[01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:13.060]  you're putting al-qaeda into all these countries to up with all the secular
[01:12:13.060 --> 01:12:16.780]  governments of mass murder well it's because we're sweet again the global
[01:12:16.780 --> 01:12:21.500]  industry you're right they they're doing this to give you a free deal and if you
[01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:26.380]  are under welfare and you are under their control taking all the shots and
[01:12:26.380 --> 01:12:29.380]  being soft killed properly you will get some free health care for a while
[01:12:29.380 --> 01:12:33.660]  watered-down lower standard of care getting rid of everybody's standard of
[01:12:33.660 --> 01:12:39.660]  care that's the new system so that's just some of the news on that front let's go
[01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:43.860]  to some Obama supporters now we've had quite a few people call in who aren't
[01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:48.860]  real Obama supporters being sarcastic about things hopefully Chester in
[01:12:48.860 --> 01:12:55.100]  Arizona says he supports globalist banker care known as Obama care eugenics
[01:12:55.100 --> 01:12:59.260]  care death panel care are you a real Obama supporter I'll know instantly you'll
[01:12:59.260 --> 01:13:02.340]  start laughing at me and being arrogant and talking about how you're on a winning
[01:13:02.340 --> 01:13:07.340]  team with Obama the reflected glory the bandwagon effect of P brains but if
[01:13:07.340 --> 01:13:11.020]  you're not one of those morons then you're being sarcastic and you're
[01:13:11.020 --> 01:13:14.620]  calling in breaking the rules we want to open the phones up only for Obama care

[01:14:09.260 --> 01:14:14.500]  supporter yes Alex I like your introduction there and so far I like
[01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:19.780]  your show this is the first time I ever been on here and let me start off Alex by
[01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:25.700]  saying that I am the president of the senior citizen fight back.org and what
[01:14:25.700 --> 01:14:29.780]  we do we help senior citizens get off the streets and into affordable housing
[01:14:29.780 --> 01:14:36.740]  now to the bummer care program it will benefit a lot of the senior citizens
[01:14:36.740 --> 01:14:40.700]  that are homeless and we would be able to start to work with them and get them
[01:14:40.700 --> 01:14:45.700]  sign up to be able to get them medical care that's why I believe that the
[01:14:45.700 --> 01:14:50.900]  bummer care program will help a lot of senior citizens that does not have
[01:14:50.900 --> 01:14:55.420]  insurance covers this very day that are living out on the street to where they
[01:14:55.420 --> 01:15:03.620]  can go in now to a medical center and sign up and get you know medical help
[01:15:03.620 --> 01:15:08.260]  not only maybe get that hold on me excuse me excuse me there but not only
[01:15:08.260 --> 01:15:14.500]  get medical attention but also get you know fight tension as well you know I
[01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:18.820]  understand okay now you sound like a nice reasonable guy and I understand of
[01:15:18.820 --> 01:15:22.420]  Godzilla attack Tokyo but then the next day he offered to hand out mandates
[01:15:22.420 --> 01:15:28.180]  people brought might take them the point is sir the system is bankrupt they've
[01:15:28.180 --> 01:15:33.180]  used this to domesticate everybody and get everybody dependent seniors can go
[01:15:33.180 --> 01:15:39.980]  in and get health care under the systems that are already there on record I
[01:15:39.980 --> 01:15:43.860]  know that they deny citizens the cares like they deny veterans because we're
[01:15:43.860 --> 01:15:55.340]  the enemy I understand all of that I am I am aware of all of that I am I I I
[01:15:55.340 --> 01:15:59.540]  fully understand that this country's been shut down the industrialized and
[01:15:59.540 --> 01:16:02.340]  you're just hoping to get something for poor people out there that really need
[01:16:02.340 --> 01:16:05.820]  it and I said if you're already on welfare already poor or already a
[01:16:05.820 --> 01:16:11.180]  senior and you're eating dog food Obamacare in the first phase might be an
[01:16:11.180 --> 01:16:14.500]  okay deal but but do you understand sir they really do have death panels in
[01:16:14.500 --> 01:16:17.780]  there and it really is meant to further bankrupt things and make the whole
[01:16:17.780 --> 01:16:24.180]  system go socialist no matter what system you have a capitalism system a
[01:16:24.180 --> 01:16:30.180]  socialism system or Terry's it says the government they're not going to work
[01:16:30.180 --> 01:16:35.180]  communism all these system the mankind and set up this very day they're not
[01:16:35.180 --> 01:16:39.820]  going to work because I'm a God-fearing man I only believe in God Kingdom and we
[01:16:39.820 --> 01:16:44.220]  get now you know I don't want to get off the the issue about supporting Obamacare
[01:16:44.220 --> 01:16:49.780]  but I believe that it will help a lot of a homeless senior citizen sir did you see
[01:16:49.780 --> 01:16:54.820]  all the poor ladies begging Obama for a free house on on on television and as
[01:16:54.820 --> 01:16:58.860]  you know black unemployment is double in the last five years under Obama what it
[01:16:58.860 --> 01:17:04.820]  was yes I understand you know that yeah well you know it's like I said big you
[01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:10.500]  know capitalism big business sir this is this this is this hope economy but you
[01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:16.180]  got to have a plan it's like buying lottery tickets that is a failure for
[01:17:16.180 --> 01:17:21.800]  one you know person and maybe a good thing for the guy who's one out of a
[01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:26.500]  million but let me ask you this do you think lottery tickets are a good idea
[01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:33.460]  I don't believe in gambling but it does you know help let's put it that way it
[01:17:33.460 --> 01:17:40.700]  does help okay it put a hope in people mind but I don't believe in it no I
[01:17:40.700 --> 01:17:45.660]  don't believe in it no but see you don't believe in it you don't do it but it
[01:17:45.660 --> 01:17:51.500]  gives people hope see it's kind of like giving somebody a a life raft and going
[01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:55.180]  you're about to go in the North Atlantic you'll die in five minutes it's so cold
[01:17:55.180 --> 01:17:58.540]  without this life raft here's the life raft get it and blow it up and you get
[01:17:58.540 --> 01:18:04.420]  the end and you find out it's got 50 holes in it so it's a false hope it's a
[01:18:04.420 --> 01:18:07.780]  setup sir and that's what makes me so mad about Obamacare God bless you I
[01:18:07.780 --> 01:18:13.380]  appreciate your call folks we're in deep trouble I mean that's all I can tell you
[01:18:13.380 --> 01:18:17.260]  let's go ahead and talk to Elliott in Ohio go ahead is this a real Obama
[01:18:17.260 --> 01:18:20.980]  supporter yeah
[01:18:20.980 --> 01:18:30.340]  Obama supporter per se but I don't have health insurance and anytime ago the ER
[01:18:30.340 --> 01:18:34.380]  they just will me out of there after they check vitals and I have a serious
[01:18:34.380 --> 01:18:41.140]  health condition that's right but you need to you need to demand you need to
[01:18:41.140 --> 01:18:44.460]  go to the charity hospital which most of them are they just don't need charity
[01:18:44.460 --> 01:18:48.500]  hospital I mean I could pay for my own bills it's just that they know
[01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:54.060]  diagnosing me would be bad for business so okay let me tell you something we know
[01:18:54.060 --> 01:19:00.020]  that we know the health care system is very corrupt they wrote this bill
[01:19:01.060 --> 01:19:06.940]  well I'm saying that benefit ER 20 times in the last three months for different
[01:19:06.940 --> 01:19:10.500]  emergency rooms family doctors this is kind of like shooting yourself in the
[01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:13.860]  foot and saying it hurts maybe if I shoot myself in the foot with a shotgun it'll
[01:19:13.860 --> 01:19:19.580]  fix it but you understand it was written by the globalist to take over
[01:19:19.580 --> 01:19:24.540]  health care and just diminish the care and give you even worse care just like
[01:19:24.540 --> 01:19:29.940]  troops get at the VA do you understand that I think that the health care system
[01:19:29.940 --> 01:19:35.140]  is designed to weed out people that are sick they can't that's right that's right
[01:19:35.140 --> 01:19:40.300]  it's eugenics care and they and they're getting rid the elite are gonna have all
[01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:43.740]  the life extension in their private clinics they don't want you having access
[01:19:43.740 --> 01:19:47.940]  to that that's why they're bringing government in to bring full control only
[01:19:47.940 --> 01:19:52.300]  thing that I'm looking forward to is not being denied health coverage because I
[01:19:52.300 --> 01:19:56.980]  know buddy get ready you're gonna you know you're gonna get your vials checked
[01:19:56.980 --> 01:20:03.020]  and get given aspirin just like the VA protecting your home with a security

[01:24:21.220 --> 01:24:32.940]  ladies and gentlemen we are back live and we're joined by dr. Edward F group
[01:24:32.940 --> 01:24:36.900]  the third doing research over the years his name just continues to come up as
[01:24:36.900 --> 01:24:41.300]  the guy and he's got so many doctorates here behind his name I can't even go
[01:24:41.300 --> 01:24:47.420]  over all of it but we'll in the next segment get into some of that but it's
[01:24:47.420 --> 01:24:50.300]  I don't know it's got to be like 10 different things of all the things you've
[01:24:50.300 --> 01:24:53.220]  done dr. group what are you most proud of and I want to get your take on
[01:24:53.220 --> 01:24:57.740]  Obamacare and what you know about it and then we'll get into some of the big
[01:24:57.740 --> 01:25:01.540]  health issues out there and some of the big secrets that the establishment
[01:25:01.540 --> 01:25:04.580]  doesn't want people to be aware of I would say probably the biggest
[01:25:04.580 --> 01:25:08.100]  accomplishment is just getting the information out to the public letting
[01:25:08.100 --> 01:25:13.180]  them know what causes disease because the medical system still treats the
[01:25:13.180 --> 01:25:16.300]  symptoms and not and they don't want to treat the cause obviously because they
[01:25:16.300 --> 01:25:20.140]  lose money if they treat the cause the cause is all the toxins that are
[01:25:20.140 --> 01:25:24.460]  coming in through the air the water the food the GMOs the fluoride all the
[01:25:24.460 --> 01:25:28.580]  contaminants and the poisons and really there's a simple solution which is just
[01:25:28.580 --> 01:25:32.620]  detoxification and you know letting those individuals clean themselves and
[01:25:32.620 --> 01:25:36.940]  get healthy eating organic foods and I think we've come a long way in the last
[01:25:36.940 --> 01:25:41.100]  10 or 15 years pushing for that and with your help and everybody else's help
[01:25:41.100 --> 01:25:46.380]  exposing all the disease-causing agents that are out there well I talk to talk
[01:25:46.380 --> 01:25:49.460]  I don't want to walk I used to be a guy that exercised a lot of them for a
[01:25:49.460 --> 01:25:52.700]  long time to stop doing it but now in the last few years I've gotten back into
[01:25:52.700 --> 01:25:55.900]  it lost a lot of weight got a lot healthier even though I work a lot of
[01:25:55.900 --> 01:26:01.380]  hours many days and have a stressful job I couldn't do it without you know
[01:26:01.380 --> 01:26:04.260]  trying to get back to being healthy I mean there's just no way and we see
[01:26:04.260 --> 01:26:07.780]  people just collapsing everywhere I'm seeing a lot of insanity out there
[01:26:07.780 --> 01:26:11.700]  means just and the numbers show the society's in trouble all the
[01:26:11.700 --> 01:26:15.660]  electromagnetic radiation all the GMO all the fluoride in the water all the
[01:26:15.660 --> 01:26:19.140]  chemicals all the additives what do you think the establishment's thinking Dr.
[01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:23.900]  I think that they're trying to control the population really I mean because if
[01:26:23.900 --> 01:26:27.220]  you put everything together it all leads up to that poisoning the water
[01:26:27.220 --> 01:26:31.980]  supply poisoning the air supply I mean the whole Obamacare situation is still
[01:26:31.980 --> 01:26:36.140]  not going to do anything but create more sickness and more disease throughout
[01:26:36.140 --> 01:26:40.500]  the world I mean we just we keep going down down down down instead of up up up
[01:26:40.500 --> 01:26:46.140]  up but the good thing is people are with the help of the Internet going online
[01:26:46.140 --> 01:26:48.860]  starting to look for things because they're going back and forth to the
[01:26:48.860 --> 01:26:53.380]  doctor they're on 15 20 medications and nobody can tell you what happens in the
[01:26:53.380 --> 01:26:56.740]  system when you put all those medications together and they're having more
[01:26:56.740 --> 01:26:59.980]  side effects and nobody's getting better so people are actually starting to take
[01:26:59.980 --> 01:27:03.860]  responsibility for their own health now I think that's what's happening and it's
[01:27:03.860 --> 01:27:07.860]  going to be more important than ever I was actually watching this weekend hours
[01:27:07.860 --> 01:27:12.900]  and hours at night of codex alimentarius debate in Germany other places folks
[01:27:12.900 --> 01:27:16.260]  don't know multinationals set it up they run it they've already done it in
[01:27:16.260 --> 01:27:20.340]  Europe banning vitamins and minerals vitamin C down to levels that do
[01:27:20.340 --> 01:27:25.380]  nothing and making a bottle of vitamin C costs 50 euros when it doesn't even have
[01:27:25.380 --> 01:27:30.140]  the vitamin C of an orange peel I mean they're doing everything they can to to
[01:27:30.140 --> 01:27:34.900]  take over people trying to take care of themselves that's exactly what they're
[01:27:34.900 --> 01:27:38.660]  doing and they're doing a good job of it too because people are dumbed down I
[01:27:38.660 --> 01:27:43.860]  mean and now they're doing it from when the women are pregnant I mean used to be
[01:27:43.860 --> 01:27:48.700]  they would start doing this when kids got 15 16 but look at the last 15 years
[01:27:48.700 --> 01:27:54.420]  look at how many kids now are being diagnosed with ADD ADHD autism look at
[01:27:54.420 --> 01:27:58.420]  the mineral deficiencies in pregnant women look at all the chemicals coming
[01:27:58.420 --> 01:28:02.300]  out through their breast milk right now look at the soy formulas that they're
[01:28:02.300 --> 01:28:05.540]  feeding children with the GMOs and all that yeah it's not like it's an accident
[01:28:05.540 --> 01:28:08.660]  now the thousands of types of plastic they pick the types that are estrogen
[01:28:08.660 --> 01:28:15.100]  mimicers as soy the the way they process it knowing it's giving estrogen to the
[01:28:15.100 --> 01:28:21.180]  I mean this is a plan yeah we are in an estrogen dominant society for men and
[01:28:21.180 --> 01:28:24.980]  women and that's where iodine comes in too because estrogen when you're
[01:28:24.980 --> 01:28:28.580]  deficient in iodine your estrogen levels can go up because the thyroid
[01:28:28.580 --> 01:28:32.740]  gland regulates your hormones and keeps your estrogen levels in balance and
[01:28:32.740 --> 01:28:35.740]  keeps your keeps your hormones in balance by the way you look like you're
[01:28:35.740 --> 01:28:40.900]  about a 25 year old surfer and you're 46 well thank you thank you it's all due
[01:28:40.900 --> 01:28:45.740]  to eating healthy eating an organic diet and avoiding all the chemicals I mean
[01:28:45.740 --> 01:28:50.220]  even household chemicals keeping the air clean etc so I try to avoid all those
[01:28:50.220 --> 01:28:54.940]  things as much as possible anything that causes disease and try to only put
[01:28:54.940 --> 01:28:59.100]  things in my system that are going to create health instead of disease now I
[01:28:59.100 --> 01:29:02.700]  want to talk more about Obamacare when we come back and then take a few calls
[01:29:02.700 --> 01:29:06.340]  but then I want to get into iodine that's it's funny that you're scheduled
[01:29:06.340 --> 01:29:10.860]  here today when I happen to be launching survival shield which you
[01:29:10.860 --> 01:29:14.820]  actually formulated this is the best form of nascent iodine and you're going
[01:29:14.820 --> 01:29:17.300]  to help us dr. group because you're one of the top formulators in the country
[01:29:17.300 --> 01:29:21.900]  come out the whole line of products one of them that you developed with Anthony
[01:29:21.900 --> 01:29:26.660]  Gucci arty that is going to be a super detox coming out very very soon we won't
[01:29:26.660 --> 01:29:30.500]  get into that too much today but this this nascent iodine I'm told is one of
[01:29:30.500 --> 01:29:34.980]  the top detoxers of fluoride as well absolutely I mean the fact of the matter
[01:29:34.980 --> 01:29:38.780]  is pretty much everybody is deficient in iodine we don't have iodine in the
[01:29:38.780 --> 01:29:44.060]  soil anymore only a fifth of the salt has eyes iodized and nobody can get
[01:29:44.060 --> 01:29:48.300]  enough iodine in their system and we'll talk about all the different things that
[01:29:48.300 --> 01:29:52.460]  that let's talk about that we come back we're on the March the Empire's on the
[01:29:52.460 --> 01:30:03.580]  run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network the world is discovering the power of

[01:34:11.140 --> 01:34:16.260]  exciting exciting work and what big pharma is doing is running around trying
[01:34:16.260 --> 01:34:20.300]  to block all this when they grab it manipulate it and patent it and then
[01:34:20.300 --> 01:34:24.380]  charge it 300 bucks for fish oil instead of you know 30 bucks or 10 bucks this is
[01:34:24.380 --> 01:34:28.220]  what they're doing and and we are launching survival shield nascent
[01:34:28.220 --> 01:34:33.180]  iodine dietary supplement I did a lot of research on this because I talked a
[01:34:33.180 --> 01:34:35.700]  lot of scientists they said well to avoid the increased radiation in the
[01:34:35.700 --> 01:34:39.980]  northern hemisphere from Fukushima and all the other disasters that we've seen
[01:34:39.980 --> 01:34:44.180]  Chernobyl all the other leaks the only hemisphere has more than double the
[01:34:44.180 --> 01:34:48.460]  level it was just 60 years ago and all the cancer increases the UN says about a
[01:34:48.460 --> 01:34:52.020]  million people died from Chernobyl alone Fukushima is much bigger that's
[01:34:52.020 --> 01:34:56.900]  ongoing move to the southern hemisphere we've actually looked at moving my
[01:34:56.900 --> 01:35:01.140]  wife and children there if a big reactor blows up in North America and is
[01:35:01.140 --> 01:35:06.460]  coming across Texas we will because even then nascent iodine isn't enough but
[01:35:06.460 --> 01:35:10.140]  with the background radiation and stuff all the experts I've talked to survival
[01:35:10.140 --> 01:35:14.380]  shield the nascent iodine is the best that's what all the literature says and
[01:35:14.380 --> 01:35:19.260]  I wanted to ask Dr. Group why that is they get into not just survival shield
[01:35:19.260 --> 01:35:24.540]  the nascent iodine from infowarslife.com but just in general why
[01:35:24.540 --> 01:35:29.660]  hyperthyroidism and women's off the chart why there's so many problems with
[01:35:29.660 --> 01:35:36.100]  pineal gland well on the periodic table fluoride sodium fluoride and iodine
[01:35:36.100 --> 01:35:40.340]  are right there beside each other so they put in the water what is bad for
[01:35:40.340 --> 01:35:43.540]  the thyroid and take out of the salt used to have good government 50 years
[01:35:43.540 --> 01:35:46.940]  ago they're like put it in the salt you need it no no they're like no no no no
[01:35:46.940 --> 01:35:52.100]  take that out put this in what a sick joke ladies and gentlemen and if the
[01:35:52.100 --> 01:35:55.380]  government's gonna force Medicaid is hey you know iodine but still that's
[01:35:55.380 --> 01:36:00.180]  unethical it's our job to protect ourselves survival shield the first
[01:36:00.180 --> 01:36:04.820]  rollout more coming out next month at infowarslife.com or you can call toll
[01:36:04.820 --> 01:36:11.140]  free 888-25-33139 I did research and talked to Dr. Group but also countless
[01:36:11.140 --> 01:36:15.180]  other medical doctors and nutritionist scientists saw what they're officially
[01:36:15.180 --> 01:36:19.540]  saying protect your thyroid from radiation you know they've got these
[01:36:19.540 --> 01:36:22.420]  chemicalized pills that are so cheap put out by the government that are
[01:36:22.420 --> 01:36:26.060]  recommended that's better than nothing they've got the chemical iodine Dr. Group
[01:36:26.060 --> 01:36:30.260]  and then I'll quit plugging you help formulate this double strength half the
[01:36:30.260 --> 01:36:37.660]  price of the leading competitor the info wars life.com survival shield what is
[01:36:37.660 --> 01:36:40.500]  different about your formulation which I want to thank you for formulating this
[01:36:40.500 --> 01:36:47.940]  for us in the FDA approved and accredited lab up in Utah what is different
[01:36:47.940 --> 01:36:52.900]  from this compared to what most people are taking and then get into the power
[01:36:52.900 --> 01:36:57.780]  of iodine period the difference between that is if you look at different types of
[01:36:57.780 --> 01:37:02.820]  iodine whether it's for radiation or exposure or if you're just taking it
[01:37:02.820 --> 01:37:07.260]  for thyroid health you're gonna have potassium usually bonded to assault
[01:37:07.260 --> 01:37:10.860]  which is gonna be potassium iodide or sodium iodide those are gonna be the
[01:37:10.860 --> 01:37:14.020]  pills that they hand out after Chernobyl and everything else but those
[01:37:14.020 --> 01:37:18.060]  have to be broken down in the body they do work like you said but you also have
[01:37:18.060 --> 01:37:22.500]  a lot of excipients and fillers and magnesium stirrate and a bunch of toxins
[01:37:22.500 --> 01:37:26.580]  so why take something good if it's also bonded with a lot of toxins what we
[01:37:26.580 --> 01:37:31.100]  wanted to do is we wanted to create an iodine that was in the atomic form now
[01:37:31.100 --> 01:37:34.820]  other iodine is going to be in a diatomic form which he means it has two
[01:37:34.820 --> 01:37:39.140]  bonds and the body has to break one sometimes the body doesn't break it so
[01:37:39.140 --> 01:37:45.260]  you could take a lot of iodine and only absorb maybe 10% or 20% we wanted
[01:37:45.260 --> 01:37:48.220]  something that's going to go straight into the bloodstream and straight into
[01:37:48.220 --> 01:37:53.180]  the thyroid gland that you could get a usable form of iodine and the only
[01:37:53.180 --> 01:37:57.140]  different when you say detoxified or nascent iodine it just means it's in
[01:37:57.140 --> 01:38:01.060]  its atomic form another thing that we wanted to do is we want to put it in a
[01:38:01.060 --> 01:38:05.900]  vegetable glycerin base that's a USP kosher certified vegetable glycerin base
[01:38:05.900 --> 01:38:12.060]  and that product is not tested on animals it's vegan friendly it's gluten
[01:38:12.060 --> 01:38:16.140]  free it's GMO free you know all the other iodine supplements out there number
[01:38:16.140 --> 01:38:20.020]  one they're not in the nascent form number two they contain alcohol who's
[01:38:20.020 --> 01:38:23.620]  who wants to give alcohol to their child or who wants to take heavy doses of
[01:38:23.620 --> 01:38:29.740]  alcohol and that alcohol usually is from GMO corn derived and let's expand on
[01:38:29.740 --> 01:38:35.340]  that my family's been taking this my wife others folks from the office they
[01:38:35.340 --> 01:38:39.140]  go hmm why does this almost taste good compared to other iodine that tastes
[01:38:39.140 --> 01:38:44.540]  horrible that's because it's real iodine atomic form it's atomic form and it's in
[01:38:44.540 --> 01:38:47.820]  a vegetable glycerin base which has a little sweet taste to it so you don't
[01:38:47.820 --> 01:38:52.620]  have the strong iodine taste like you would with some of the other products
[01:38:52.620 --> 01:38:58.060]  well keep going well the reason why people have such and this is not just
[01:38:58.060 --> 01:39:03.060]  for radiation this is for everybody women children all the guys out there I
[01:39:03.060 --> 01:39:06.060]  mean everybody pretty much has an iodine deficiency and you have to ask
[01:39:06.060 --> 01:39:10.660]  yourself why do we all have iodine deficiencies well iodine was added to
[01:39:10.660 --> 01:39:16.420]  salt because they knew the Horth health organizations how much of a problem it
[01:39:16.420 --> 01:39:19.900]  was because they had of the goiter belt which was up around Michigan they
[01:39:19.900 --> 01:39:24.460]  started all these people started having goiter years ago a goiter is a cystic
[01:39:24.460 --> 01:39:31.740]  scar tissue lump that forms in your thyroid from not enough iodine well so
[01:39:31.740 --> 01:39:36.860]  they put it in salt but now they came back and said don't eat salt because it
[01:39:36.860 --> 01:39:39.820]  causes heart disease so you have a lot of people that aren't putting salt in
[01:39:39.820 --> 01:39:43.940]  their foods anymore so you're not getting enough iodine from salt I go all
[01:39:43.940 --> 01:39:47.900]  over the place most women over 40 have that jowl even if they're skinny you
[01:39:47.900 --> 01:39:51.980]  can see they have what African tribes and people get when they don't get iodine
[01:39:51.980 --> 01:39:55.740]  I mean it's right there and no one will tell them their doctor will put them on
[01:39:55.740 --> 01:40:00.060]  thyroid medicine and not tell them right well the woman's thyroid gland is twice
[01:40:00.060 --> 01:40:05.420]  as large as the males and that's why six to one female to males have thyroid
[01:40:05.420 --> 01:40:11.180]  conditions depending on where you live so women especially need iodine and when
[01:40:11.180 --> 01:40:14.980]  women are pregnant when their hormones rise it causes a severe iodine
[01:40:14.980 --> 01:40:19.140]  deficiency so they need iodine all the time we don't have enough iodine in the
[01:40:19.140 --> 01:40:23.860]  food supply anymore either because the main source of iodine is going to be
[01:40:23.860 --> 01:40:27.220]  from sea vegetables or sea kelp and stuff like that that's why the ladies in
[01:40:27.220 --> 01:40:30.820]  Japan and we don't really see iodine deficiency so much into Japanese or if
[01:40:30.820 --> 01:40:34.580]  you live next to the water but everywhere else we see major issues with
[01:40:34.580 --> 01:40:39.020]  the thyroid and not only the thyroid but this is what the medical practitioners
[01:40:39.020 --> 01:40:43.900]  and the doctors and organizations aren't telling you there's been an extreme
[01:40:43.900 --> 01:40:48.020]  rise in polycystic ovarian disease PCOS with women
[01:40:48.020 --> 01:40:52.740]  fibrosis breast disease because iodine is stored in the breast tissue the
[01:40:52.740 --> 01:40:56.740]  ovaries the prostate glands and men it's utilized by every single cell in the
[01:40:56.740 --> 01:41:01.100]  body people just associated with the thyroid but it's very important tell
[01:41:01.100 --> 01:41:04.940]  folks about all those studies they know the increased breast cancer the
[01:41:04.940 --> 01:41:11.940]  increased cancer in men in the prostate they know it's the fluoride being in the
[01:41:11.940 --> 01:41:14.860]  presence of where the iodine should be I see the studies in the news all the time
[01:41:14.860 --> 01:41:19.580]  but the doctors won't tell people well the doctors they don't know because
[01:41:19.580 --> 01:41:22.740]  they're not taught because it's their job to prescribe medications and make
[01:41:22.740 --> 01:41:26.380]  money but you know if you look at it exactly what you're saying why are we
[01:41:26.380 --> 01:41:31.380]  iodine deficient because it's iodine is a halogen just like fluorine and bromine
[01:41:31.380 --> 01:41:38.460]  and iodine and you have these bonding points on the thyroid gland and with
[01:41:38.460 --> 01:41:41.580]  all the fluoride coming in from the toothpaste and the mouthwash and the
[01:41:41.580 --> 01:41:45.540]  water supply and chlorine is the other halogen in there too and you have chlorine
[01:41:45.540 --> 01:41:48.460]  people swim in chlorinated pools you have it in the water supply you have it
[01:41:48.460 --> 01:41:53.660]  everywhere all that builds up inside the system and it blocks the receptor sites
[01:41:53.660 --> 01:41:57.140]  for the iodine because if there's chlorine going by or there's fluoride
[01:41:57.140 --> 01:42:02.900]  going by in the bloodstream the thyroid will take it up as if it was iodine and
[01:42:02.900 --> 01:42:08.020]  block the absorption of iodine so then you have major problems now what iodine
[01:42:08.020 --> 01:42:12.740]  does is as soon as you put it in the body it actually helps detoxify fluoride
[01:42:12.740 --> 01:42:18.740]  it helps detoxify bromine which by the way iodine was put into bread white
[01:42:18.740 --> 01:42:24.020]  flour years ago when the organizations found that we were so deficient in it
[01:42:24.020 --> 01:42:31.820]  but then they replaced it because it also bromide works as a anti insecticide
[01:42:31.820 --> 01:42:37.620]  agent when they do white flour they put bromide in there so now we since they
[01:42:37.620 --> 01:42:42.620]  made that change from iodine in white flour to bromide in white flour we've
[01:42:42.620 --> 01:42:46.900]  seen massive iodine deficiency and now the doctors are prescribing all the
[01:42:46.900 --> 01:42:50.220]  thyroid medications and there's not addressing the root cause of the problem
[01:42:50.220 --> 01:42:56.140]  by giving people iodine instead of all the thyroid medications so instead of
[01:42:56.140 --> 01:43:01.540]  even taking thyroid replacement you should just be taking iodine I believe
[01:43:01.540 --> 01:43:05.260]  in looking at all the different studies and the doctors out there that use
[01:43:05.260 --> 01:43:10.740]  iodine you see fibrocystic breast disease go away polycystic ovarian disease
[01:43:10.740 --> 01:43:14.980]  go away you see the goiters in the thyroid go away it can take a period of
[01:43:14.980 --> 01:43:19.780]  time taking iodine every single day but as a preventative measure I think
[01:43:19.780 --> 01:43:24.420]  everybody should stock up on iodine and here's why in the case of a disaster
[01:43:24.420 --> 01:43:28.900]  iodine is hard to get I mean we had to go through DEA approval because it's
[01:43:28.900 --> 01:43:35.580]  used to make methamphetamine yeah so but this is expensive I mean for those
[01:43:35.580 --> 01:43:39.380]  that don't know compared to most supplements I had to pay a lot of money
[01:43:39.380 --> 01:43:42.620]  and I'm that's why I'm selling it like half price when the leading
[01:43:42.620 --> 01:43:46.340]  competitor it's like 60 bucks for a bottle of this 30 bucks in infall wars
[01:43:46.340 --> 01:43:50.900]  at live.com you just really can't put a price on your health and saving your
[01:43:50.900 --> 01:43:54.940]  family I mean the thing is I recommend everybody stock up and at least have 10
[01:43:54.940 --> 01:44:00.540]  20 30 however much you can afford at your house because you can use it for cuts if
[01:44:00.540 --> 01:44:04.100]  you're in a situation where the power goes out or if you need to purify water
[01:44:04.100 --> 01:44:08.340]  you can put some drops in there I mean iodine has so many uses you should just
[01:44:08.340 --> 01:44:14.700]  always keep it handy in the case of a you know a tragic radio radiation event
[01:44:14.700 --> 01:44:20.500]  you might have to take up to a bottle in one day with for radiation loading to
[01:44:20.500 --> 01:44:27.380]  get enough iodine in your system to block the radioactive iodine 131 so not
[01:44:27.380 --> 01:44:31.820]  only that I recommend and my children even take the iodine on a daily basis
[01:44:31.820 --> 01:44:36.140]  because you're just not going to get enough of it in your daily diet but
[01:44:36.140 --> 01:44:40.060]  then I've seen people that demonize even giving your children supplements you
[01:44:40.060 --> 01:44:45.580]  know famously back in 2010 there was the cover we've shown this before of readers
[01:44:45.580 --> 01:44:49.620]  digest saying you know the vitamin hoax you don't need them and on the back was
[01:44:49.620 --> 01:44:53.980]  the big you know Prozac ad basically and half the magazine was drug company ads
[01:44:53.980 --> 01:44:59.900]  they are really out to get vitamin C iodine these key things because they're
[01:44:59.900 --> 01:45:05.540]  out of business if people discover this it's all about dumbing down the society
[01:45:05.540 --> 01:45:09.400]  and one of the the ways they the Nazis did it and you know back in the day with
[01:45:09.400 --> 01:45:13.060]  fluoride you know the adding sodium fluoride to the water and it dumps you
[01:45:13.060 --> 01:45:16.660]  down and it causes calcification of your pineal gland and the pineal gland is
[01:45:16.660 --> 01:45:21.180]  you know in all the Indian philosophies and stuff it's your third eye and it's
[01:45:21.180 --> 01:45:26.100]  brings your level of consciousness up well they've proven now that the fluoride
[01:45:26.100 --> 01:45:32.020]  and a lack of iodine causes a decreased IQ and mental retardation if the mother
[01:45:32.020 --> 01:45:34.900]  doesn't have enough iodine or the child doesn't have that's right separately a
[01:45:34.900 --> 01:45:38.260]  woman that drinks fluoridated water and you can pull these studies up has a
[01:45:38.260 --> 01:45:42.700]  lower IQ in the child overall but the same thing not having iodine does it so
[01:45:42.700 --> 01:45:46.580]  it's a double whammy exactly the body's supposed to have iodine the fluoride
[01:45:46.580 --> 01:45:50.660]  wouldn't have an effect so I mean you can trace all this stuff back and say
[01:45:50.660 --> 01:45:56.460]  okay well why is it such a plan to take the iodine out of everything and even
[01:45:56.460 --> 01:46:01.340]  with Fukushima where you've poisoned all of the kelp and everything in the
[01:46:01.340 --> 01:46:05.540]  whole Pacific Ocean because the kelp has the same receptors pretty much as we
[01:46:05.540 --> 01:46:09.540]  have in the thyroid that take in iodine so the kelp is actually taking in the
[01:46:09.540 --> 01:46:17.020]  radio trophic iodine or the iodine 131 and causing genetic and DNA damage to
[01:46:17.020 --> 01:46:23.700]  the actual product that we take iodine from so everybody is going to need an
[01:46:23.700 --> 01:46:28.140]  iodine supplement sooner or later and better sooner than later well by the way
[01:46:28.140 --> 01:46:31.300]  I mean like Adams two years ago said you ought to carry this modifier and it's a
[01:46:31.300 --> 01:46:35.420]  small company from way down you know near the South Pole it's very very clean
[01:46:35.420 --> 01:46:41.420]  and it's great well okay fine I'll carry it you know I believe you and and that's
[01:46:41.420 --> 01:46:44.220]  how we fund our operation as well to get the news out it's selling good products
[01:46:44.220 --> 01:46:48.820]  and so I listen to you I'll listen to him Weldon started taking it and I need to
[01:46:48.820 --> 01:46:53.380]  get Weldon Henson here he already you know looked good was already in good
[01:46:53.380 --> 01:46:57.980]  shape and he's a successful country music singer all over Texas but he's like
[01:46:57.980 --> 01:47:01.620]  man I really listen he said about from four months his nails grew faster his
[01:47:01.620 --> 01:47:06.940]  hair grew faster he said that a little spot on his hair sort of coming back a
[01:47:06.940 --> 01:47:11.460]  little bit it was amazing and he lost all this weight without even you know
[01:47:11.460 --> 01:47:14.860]  still eating the same thing still going out and playing till two at night three
[01:47:14.860 --> 01:47:19.900]  nights a week you know playing at rodeos all over the state he started going man
[01:47:19.900 --> 01:47:24.900]  you got to take this so I started taking the modifier and now my wife takes it
[01:47:24.900 --> 01:47:28.460]  constantly she's addicted to it and now about a month ago I started taking this
[01:47:28.460 --> 01:47:33.660]  as we were developing it and your brand of it blew me away the atomic iodine
[01:47:33.660 --> 01:47:37.620]  in fourslife.com I'm not trying to plug it I didn't even mean to
[01:47:37.620 --> 01:47:41.500]  we're gonna get into iodine itself there's other great nation iodine out
[01:47:41.500 --> 01:47:46.180]  there you know Dr. Groups plug your website well my website is global healing
[01:47:46.180 --> 01:47:49.860]  center.com and we have a just a wealth of information up there that you got
[01:47:49.860 --> 01:47:53.380]  hundreds of stuff hundreds of things you formulated it's amazing yes I mean in
[01:47:53.380 --> 01:47:56.940]  the reason why I started formulating stuff is because I had a cancer clinic
[01:47:56.940 --> 01:48:00.580]  years ago I just delve right in and I wanted to you know work with cancer
[01:48:00.580 --> 01:48:04.060]  patients and we started using actually modifying was one of the products that
[01:48:04.060 --> 01:48:07.700]  we used and iodine is extremely effective against cancer I mean there's
[01:48:07.700 --> 01:48:11.900]  doctors out there that are specializing in breast cancer right now and they're
[01:48:11.900 --> 01:48:17.580]  having women with breast cancer rub and paint iodine all around their breasts
[01:48:17.580 --> 01:48:21.860]  and they're getting extremely good results even with ovarian cancer now you
[01:48:21.860 --> 01:48:25.460]  know the government and the medical community is pushing for double mass
[01:48:25.460 --> 01:48:30.100] ectomies they want to do a hysterectomy on women that have ovarian cysts and just
[01:48:30.100 --> 01:48:35.020]  take it out you can't take organs out I mean every organ is there for a reason
[01:48:35.020 --> 01:48:38.420]  to be specific because I've been reading the studies these genetic traits were
[01:48:38.420 --> 01:48:42.260]  always there to be predisposed to heart attack predisposed to this type of
[01:48:42.260 --> 01:48:47.180]  cancer yeah if you drink smoke and eat all the hamburgers the point is is that
[01:48:47.180 --> 01:48:50.820]  these rates are all going up they're saying it's genetic when we already had
[01:48:50.820 --> 01:48:55.020]  the same genetics it's that we have the deficiencies but they won't tell people
[01:48:55.020 --> 01:48:59.620]  that no and there's a guy named Bruce Lipton that proved that genes don't
[01:48:59.620 --> 01:49:02.740]  cause disease it's the environment that causes the disease you might be
[01:49:02.740 --> 01:49:07.340]  predisposed to it like you said but it's the nature to be a nurture it has to be
[01:49:07.340 --> 01:49:12.420]  activated by a lack of something or too much of something else that's bad for
[01:49:12.420 --> 01:49:17.500]  you so that's the situation that we're in right now and that's one of the
[01:49:17.500 --> 01:49:23.580]  reasons prostate cancers on the rise to is because prostate is takes up iodine
[01:49:23.580 --> 01:49:28.780]  and the men that are lacking iodine causes the prostate to become cystic and
[01:49:28.780 --> 01:49:32.580]  cause the prostate to swell and eventually leads to prostate cancer let me
[01:49:32.580 --> 01:49:35.820]  ask you a question as I know it's not placebo because I just take whatever
[01:49:35.820 --> 01:49:39.180]  and even it's recommended enough seeing great results have all the studies I
[01:49:39.180 --> 01:49:43.500]  start taking you know beforehand obviously whatever I promote knowing it was
[01:49:43.500 --> 01:49:48.820]  good for me but I get energy out of this instead of you having coffee I'll have my
[01:49:48.820 --> 01:49:53.620]  onto any tangerine and I'll take something like nascent iodine and for me
[01:49:53.620 --> 01:49:58.540]  it's like a drug what's happening there or is that placebo what's happening is
[01:49:58.540 --> 01:50:02.740]  your thyroid is an endocrine gland and it's also associated with your adrenal
[01:50:02.740 --> 01:50:06.660]  glands so when you're deficient of iodine see when the iodine comes in it
[01:50:06.660 --> 01:50:11.620]  predicted the thyroid produces t3 and t4 hormones t3 just means there's three
[01:50:11.620 --> 01:50:15.940]  iodines attached and t4 means there's four iodine molecules attached when the
[01:50:15.940 --> 01:50:20.380]  thyroid is working and functioning it regulates your metabolism it regulates
[01:50:20.380 --> 01:50:25.180]  and balances your hormone it actually detoxifies mercury and heavy metals too
[01:50:25.180 --> 01:50:29.500]  and it helps regulate your adrenal glands so basically what's happening in
[01:50:29.500 --> 01:50:33.700]  the reason you have energy and you mentioned weight loss earlier that we've
[01:50:33.700 --> 01:50:38.380]  put people on iodine and over a period of eight weeks all that fat starts
[01:50:38.380 --> 01:50:42.700]  disappearing because the glands start working together and functioning again
[01:50:42.700 --> 01:50:46.060]  when we come back on ask you how much because I know we always put on the
[01:50:46.060 --> 01:50:50.300]  indication lower than what you'd really take how much info wars live survival
[01:50:50.300 --> 01:50:54.700]  shield would you take I would say depending on the condition what you
[01:50:54.700 --> 01:50:59.020]  want to work with I would take it as a maintenance dose of six drops maybe

[01:54:30.340 --> 01:54:37.460]  the next hour with a doctor group is riding shotgun with us and again the
[01:54:37.460 --> 01:54:41.140]  more I learn about nutrition and I and the more of the the mainline studies I
[01:54:41.140 --> 01:54:48.340]  read it is just mind-boggling that the average doctor medical doctor out there
[01:54:48.340 --> 01:54:52.260]  when somebody comes in with a hyperthyroid problem and a woman's
[01:54:52.260 --> 01:54:57.220]  throats all swole up and 50 years ago they put iodine in the salt on record to
[01:54:57.220 --> 01:55:01.860]  stop that and this doctors because I talked to these women the doctors don't
[01:55:01.860 --> 01:55:05.500]  know and then the women go a lot of the medical doctors that do these hormone
[01:55:05.500 --> 01:55:10.060]  clinics and they put them on a bunch of you know synthetic thyroid stuff but
[01:55:10.060 --> 01:55:14.020]  also iodine and then all of a sudden they're better again but they go through
[01:55:14.020 --> 01:55:18.780]  such hell before they're even told that when it's simple you need fresh fruits
[01:55:18.780 --> 01:55:22.300]  and vegetables you need vitamin C you need iodine what are some of the other
[01:55:22.300 --> 01:55:26.820]  things people really need I'll tell you the biggest breakthrough that we had and
[01:55:26.820 --> 01:55:29.980]  you know we had a cancer clinic and we saw pretty much every single degenerative
[01:55:29.980 --> 01:55:33.100]  disease you could imagine I mean we even treated the some of the royal family
[01:55:33.100 --> 01:55:37.940]  for stuff that was highly confidential and after all we were trained to I mean
[01:55:37.940 --> 01:55:41.740]  even in naturopathic school chiropractic school you're still taught to
[01:55:41.740 --> 01:55:45.940]  prescribe something for the symptom it's natural it's not a prescription it's not
[01:55:45.940 --> 01:55:50.660]  going to do any harm but my whole philosophy was let me figure out what
[01:55:50.660 --> 01:55:54.300]  the root cause of all these things are that's what's lost that's what we need
[01:55:54.300 --> 01:55:59.660]  to focus on so after 15 years and I had 260 something supplements in my cabinet
[01:55:59.660 --> 01:56:03.380]  that I would prescribe out to people but what we did that nobody else did and
[01:56:03.380 --> 01:56:08.580]  why our results were so good is that we started cleaning the body out and that's
[01:56:08.580 --> 01:56:14.300]  the key factor in cleansing and let me tell you you don't need a lot of you
[01:56:14.300 --> 01:56:17.900]  don't need bags full of all these vitamins because most of them are toxic
[01:56:17.900 --> 01:56:22.580]  anyway I mean if you go to any drugstore any wholesale store out there you're
[01:56:22.580 --> 01:56:25.860]  just going to get a bunch of go that's why I'm so honored to be working with you
[01:56:25.860 --> 01:56:30.220]  is that you are known as the guy that develops the incredibly clean you know
[01:56:30.220 --> 01:56:37.260]  organic FDA tested certified products and because I couldn't find any out there
[01:56:37.260 --> 01:56:40.460]  that was one of the reasons that I did that I mean I do have a background in
[01:56:40.460 --> 01:56:46.420]  biochemistry and chemistry my dad was a chemist and there was nobody out there
[01:56:46.420 --> 01:56:51.220]  that was doing high high quality stuff you know and really taking the time to
[01:56:51.220 --> 01:56:55.260]  track everything from start all the way through production you know what's crazy
[01:56:55.260 --> 01:57:01.260]  is that the establishment all knows this and if you run to them they they're all
[01:57:01.260 --> 01:57:05.580]  obsessed with this and are healthy they literally don't want the public to know
[01:57:05.580 --> 01:57:10.540]  this that's so evil I had the chief oncologist from MB Anderson in my office
[01:57:10.540 --> 01:57:14.460]  they tried to set me up and brought a patient in there and I brought him back
[01:57:14.460 --> 01:57:18.500]  in the back and the first thing I asked the patient was did these doctors tell
[01:57:18.500 --> 01:57:22.940]  you why you have cancer and she just looked up at me and said no and I said
[01:57:22.940 --> 01:57:27.820]  everybody sit down and let me explain to you why you have cancer so doctors
[01:57:27.820 --> 01:57:31.260]  aren't explaining to people why they have disease because you have to
[01:57:31.260 --> 01:57:34.780]  understand why you have it first to understand how to treat it I mean I'm
[01:57:34.780 --> 01:57:39.100]  not going to go rewire my notice notice the you know the answer the National
[01:57:39.100 --> 01:57:43.140]  Breast Cancer Association never asked why is it up 3,000 percent in the last 20
[01:57:43.140 --> 01:57:47.540]  years or 30 years they just say let's find the cure well no let's find out why
[01:57:47.540 --> 01:57:51.580]  it's increasing why is it increasing it's increasing because nobody is
[01:57:51.580 --> 01:57:55.060]  cleaning their body out I mean you take a shower and wash the outside of your
[01:57:55.060 --> 01:57:58.860]  body every single day but how many people do you know that are cleaning
[01:57:58.860 --> 01:58:02.380]  their intestines on a weekly basis cleaning their liver and gallbladder a
[01:58:02.380 --> 01:58:07.060]  couple times a year cleaning their kidneys cleaning their parasites out of
[01:58:07.060 --> 01:58:11.300]  there and you were promising me off air will you because I know you come to
[01:58:11.300 --> 01:58:15.380]  Austin every few weeks will you have come start coming in and put me on a
[01:58:15.380 --> 01:58:18.940]  whole program and help me absolutely absolutely I would love to go because I've
[01:58:18.940 --> 01:58:21.820]  done a few things that seem big results but with the stress level it's just I
[01:58:21.820 --> 01:58:25.740]  want to go all the way look what we found is this is very everything is in
[01:58:25.740 --> 01:58:30.620]  simplicity I mean everybody has a self healing mechanism inside their body and
[01:58:30.620 --> 01:58:34.820]  just nobody knows how to reactivate it but the easiest way to reactivate your
[01:58:34.820 --> 01:58:38.820]  body's self healing mechanism is to clean all the garbage doctor groups stay
[01:58:38.820 --> 01:58:46.540]  there only here we clean it you are listening to GCN visit GCNLive.com

[02:01:01.860 --> 02:01:04.700]  are supporting Obamacare and what we're hearing from him before he got here is
[02:01:04.700 --> 02:01:09.380]  I'm poor I'm on welfare I heard of my health care I'll be free then I go but
[02:01:09.380 --> 02:01:13.740]  wait you're supposed to get free health care all right people don't even know
[02:01:13.740 --> 02:01:17.580]  this and that's what blows me away but we'll talk more about that I'm more
[02:01:17.580 --> 02:01:21.620]  about that coming up but continuing with with iodine the news you were trying
[02:01:21.620 --> 02:01:25.380]  to tell folks they're getting disease cares what they're getting they're not
[02:01:25.380 --> 02:01:29.460]  ever gonna be better but continuing with iodine is a preventative I mean think
[02:01:29.460 --> 02:01:33.700]  of all the money that we could save if people just took iodine I mean we would
[02:01:33.700 --> 02:01:37.340]  have to think of all the money spent on fibrocystic breast disease alone think
[02:01:37.340 --> 02:01:41.380]  of all the money spent on mammograms which severely radiate the breast tissue
[02:01:41.380 --> 02:01:46.420]  think of all the money spent on prostate conditions I mean cancer it's a proven
[02:01:46.420 --> 02:01:52.380]  fact that an iodine deficiency increases the rate of cancer look at breast
[02:01:52.380 --> 02:01:55.900]  cancer look at all the walks out there I mean the the fact of the matter is all
[02:01:55.900 --> 02:02:00.580]  these people give money to all these ant these cancer organizations and nothing
[02:02:00.580 --> 02:02:04.060]  is ever done it just goes right back into the whole system but some of the
[02:02:04.060 --> 02:02:08.220]  symptoms of iodine deficiency I mean if you're at home or wherever you are right
[02:02:08.220 --> 02:02:12.420]  now and you have brain fog I mean it's hard for you to concentrate at work
[02:02:12.420 --> 02:02:18.180]  that's a symptom if you have low energy levels if you have pains if you have
[02:02:18.180 --> 02:02:23.700]  thyroid problems if you don't feel up to par for women fibrocystic breast disease
[02:02:23.700 --> 02:02:28.340]  fertility even is a source infertility I mean look at all the infertility
[02:02:28.340 --> 02:02:32.900]  clinics that are out there these days I mean we would just give women and men
[02:02:32.900 --> 02:02:37.980]  levels of iodine and then they would be able to have nice and healthy babies
[02:02:37.980 --> 02:02:43.300]  isn't it vitamin E to sociable getting pregnant vitamin E a good dose of all
[02:02:43.300 --> 02:02:48.060]  your vitamins all your minerals but eventually I mean one of the things that
[02:02:48.060 --> 02:02:51.420]  worked the best was just detoxifying them and cleaning them all out because you
[02:02:51.420 --> 02:02:54.500]  have all this stuff that builds up inside your system and builds up and builds
[02:02:54.500 --> 02:02:58.580]  up and that's why some people when they start taking iodine will have what's
[02:02:58.580 --> 02:03:02.700]  called a Hertzheimer reaction or a detoxification reaction in some cases you
[02:03:02.700 --> 02:03:07.300]  might feel a little bit worse initially than you feel better but that's a good
[02:03:07.300 --> 02:03:11.620]  sign that means you're detoxifying all that fluoride buildup the mercury buildup
[02:03:11.620 --> 02:03:15.580]  in there the bromine buildup in your system and the chlorine buildup in your
[02:03:15.580 --> 02:03:18.820]  system you don't want those things all of those things have been proven as
[02:03:18.820 --> 02:03:24.420]  carcinogens cancer-causing agents and look at aluminum for example they're
[02:03:24.420 --> 02:03:29.940]  spraying aluminum everywhere in the air through the chemtrails aluminum cans well
[02:03:29.940 --> 02:03:34.700]  if you see if you put iodine and aluminum together it causes a violent
[02:03:34.700 --> 02:03:39.340]  reaction so couple that with mercury and other metals and everything you have
[02:03:39.340 --> 02:03:43.060]  these reactions they're just literally destroying our brain cells and it's
[02:03:43.060 --> 02:03:47.180]  dumbing down the society so that's another reason why you need to protect
[02:03:47.180 --> 02:03:53.620]  the thyroid and protect your whole body and your family with iodine you bet now
[02:03:53.620 --> 02:03:56.740]  we're gonna go to break and come back and talk about ways that detoxify and
[02:03:56.740 --> 02:04:02.620]  take some phone calls but why is nascent iodine so important
[02:04:02.620 --> 02:04:07.420]  base on iodine is so important because it goes directly to the thyroid it's not
[02:04:07.420 --> 02:04:11.500]  bonded to a salt which means it doesn't have to be broken down and it's the most
[02:04:11.500 --> 02:04:15.980]  usable form it's what the body uses is what the body is designed to use it's
[02:04:15.980 --> 02:04:21.500]  an atomic form see iodine by itself the element iodine is very toxic I mean you
[02:04:21.500 --> 02:04:25.180]  can put a piece of iodine on your skin and it'll literally burn through your
[02:04:25.180 --> 02:04:31.540]  skin I mean iodine will also create a gaseous form if it's exposed to air and
[02:04:31.540 --> 02:04:36.340]  you can breathe that in and it can become toxic so we actually detoxify the
[02:04:36.340 --> 02:04:42.460]  iodine and put it in a nascent form and that way it's easily taken it goes right
[02:04:42.460 --> 02:04:45.820]  into your bloodstream and it goes right into the thyroid gland that's right you
[02:04:45.820 --> 02:04:48.260]  don't want to go to the storm by the chemical iodine and put that on your
[02:04:48.260 --> 02:04:52.580]  tongue no that's dangerous I mean you can die probably from that yeah in fact
[02:04:52.580 --> 02:04:56.740]  tell us what the FDA says about nascent don't they say nascent's the only one
[02:04:56.740 --> 02:04:59.780]  proven to protect you from the particular isotope what I read will stay

[02:08:35.740 --> 02:08:42.900]  really one of our top advisors here on health issues in the news and he advised
[02:08:42.900 --> 02:08:47.740]  us on the development of survival shield nascent atomic iodine natural healthy
[02:08:47.740 --> 02:08:52.940]  type compared to all the other groups out there it is absolutely essential that

[02:09:14.820 --> 02:09:19.300]  everybody all the experts said why are you taking regular iodine pills that
[02:09:19.300 --> 02:09:23.340]  stuff's incredibly toxic compared to nascent iodine and I looked it up and
[02:09:23.340 --> 02:09:28.220]  sure enough there it was in all the mainline literature so if you want to
[02:09:28.220 --> 02:09:31.620]  check it out you can buy them in groups up to five and get big discounts info

[02:09:49.140 --> 02:09:53.860]  to intersperse here in the conversation Obama supporters calling in who like
[02:09:53.860 --> 02:09:57.900]  Obamacare and and who really think hey I'm poor I'm gonna get free health care
[02:09:57.900 --> 02:10:01.820]  when yeah if you're on welfare you already get free health care Medicare
[02:10:01.820 --> 02:10:06.140]  Medicaid it's all there this lowers the standard of care it's it's written by
[02:10:06.140 --> 02:10:09.060]  the insurance companies to make you buy something and then I have to deliver
[02:10:09.060 --> 02:10:13.620]  care it's written by the most corrupt companies on the face of the planet and
[02:10:13.620 --> 02:10:18.460]  Dr. before we go any further into how to detox briefly and take calls how do you
[02:10:18.460 --> 02:10:22.140]  and I know it's all on your website and give that offer folks how do you
[02:10:22.140 --> 02:10:27.820]  recommend just just as a beginner people detox now I started taking as you
[02:10:27.820 --> 02:10:34.420]  recommend about six months ago the the non-gmo organic olive leaf extract I did
[02:10:34.420 --> 02:10:39.980]  get the flu like effect of that and it did really clean me out but the issue is
[02:10:39.980 --> 02:10:44.460]  people better be ready though you know to to to to get the monkey off the back
[02:10:44.460 --> 02:10:47.540]  because these chemicals these additives these are addictive they know what
[02:10:47.540 --> 02:10:51.220]  they've done well one of the things we didn't talk about Alex is the fact that
[02:10:51.220 --> 02:10:55.700]  how good iodine is that stimulating your immune system and with the threat of
[02:10:55.700 --> 02:11:00.380]  biological warfare now and with these super viruses and all this stuff is
[02:11:00.380 --> 02:11:05.180]  coming up if your thyroid gland is in good top-working condition and you have
[02:11:05.180 --> 02:11:12.180]  a store of iodine in there iodine is the best way for your body to attack
[02:11:12.180 --> 02:11:16.100]  viruses and bacteria and mycoplasms and everything else that are floating in the
[02:11:16.100 --> 02:11:19.780]  bloodstream what happens is when the blood comes through the thyroid gland it
[02:11:19.780 --> 02:11:24.500]  will secrete excess iodine into the bloodstream and kill off all of those
[02:11:24.500 --> 02:11:29.020]  components it our bodies are incredible it is but if you don't have enough iodine
[02:11:29.020 --> 02:11:33.140]  and they spray stuff or you're exposed to all these flus that are coming out all
[02:11:33.140 --> 02:11:38.060]  the time this is a one of the best anti by antibiotics right there it's so the
[02:11:38.060 --> 02:11:42.660]  thyroid the thyroid's almost like a little liver or something as you're
[02:11:42.660 --> 02:11:47.700]  saying is detoxifying the thyroid is an endocrine gland that pretty much
[02:11:47.700 --> 02:11:51.300]  regulates everything it's like the kind of like the appendix in the bow I mean
[02:11:51.300 --> 02:11:55.580]  you know the the medical science rips your appendix out if if something's
[02:11:55.580 --> 02:11:59.420]  wrong with it but with our research we found that the appendix is actually the
[02:11:59.420 --> 02:12:03.940]  micro computer system in the whole body I mean the appendix actually regulates
[02:12:03.940 --> 02:12:07.620]  your neuro your neurological well just like in dinosaurs I'm seeing all the
[02:12:07.620 --> 02:12:12.060]  studies where like worms they cut them off and they still have a stomach they
[02:12:12.060 --> 02:12:16.300]  grow a new brain and heart and they're saying it's similar that the spinal
[02:12:16.300 --> 02:12:19.780]  cord into the explained us because Bill Gates is obsessed with this the fact
[02:12:19.780 --> 02:12:23.260]  that we have little brains in our guts is what you're saying what I'm saying is
[02:12:23.260 --> 02:12:27.420]  the main processor for our whole body is located in our gut and it's the
[02:12:27.420 --> 02:12:31.620]  appendix and the Russians did research on it and the Germans did research on it
[02:12:31.620 --> 02:12:37.500]  long long time ago why do you think you ask any doctor what the appendix does and
[02:12:37.500 --> 02:12:42.340]  yes why is the appendix the only organ that met and they say it's not needed
[02:12:42.340 --> 02:12:47.980]  exactly but it's really the most important thing and why wouldn't it be
[02:12:47.980 --> 02:12:51.900]  because that's the first exposure point to every single thing that comes in your
[02:12:51.900 --> 02:12:55.940]  body and so if your body's poisoned it's gonna be freaking out because we're
[02:12:55.940 --> 02:13:00.420]  eating GMO the answer is cut it out the answer is cut it it's like freaking out
[02:13:00.420 --> 02:13:05.060]  going made a danger will Robinson and the answer is oh my gosh you know the
[02:13:05.060 --> 02:13:11.140]  fire alarms going off deactivated exactly I mean if you look at all the
[02:13:11.140 --> 02:13:16.580]  toxins that cause disease 98 probably 99% of them enter through the intestinal
[02:13:16.580 --> 02:13:20.540]  lining the appendix is located right at the juncture of the small intestine in
[02:13:20.540 --> 02:13:24.860]  the large intestine so it first gets to see and feel every single thing that
[02:13:24.860 --> 02:13:29.500]  comes into your system and help adjust the pH levels send signals to your
[02:13:29.500 --> 02:13:33.820]  neurological system but with GMOs and all the other acid-forming foods and
[02:13:33.820 --> 02:13:39.300]  stuff you're actually with the BT toxin from GMOs burning holes into the
[02:13:39.300 --> 02:13:42.340]  intestinal lining and these particles are going straight into the blood well
[02:13:42.340 --> 02:13:45.540]  you know the German universities and also one in the US found the honey bees
[02:13:45.540 --> 02:13:50.620]  were dying because they would eat the BT corn pollen and that that was burning
[02:13:50.620 --> 02:13:54.780]  holes in them yes and the butterfly population too as well well they're
[02:13:54.780 --> 02:13:59.340]  extremists though let's just kill them so the whole point of the matter is
[02:13:59.340 --> 02:14:02.900]  repair the guts so when you're talking about cleansing I always recommend
[02:14:02.900 --> 02:14:07.780]  people do intestinal cleansing using an oxygen-based cleanser because a lot of
[02:14:07.780 --> 02:14:12.020]  the psyllium and sena and cascara sagrada some of these bulking agents or
[02:14:12.020 --> 02:14:16.180]  even the toxic laxatives that you get from the drug stores are going to cause
[02:14:16.180 --> 02:14:21.140]  more damage and they're not actually going to bubble away all that compaction
[02:14:21.140 --> 02:14:26.700]  with all those toxins in there so by using an oxygen-based cleanser you can
[02:14:26.700 --> 02:14:30.420]  actually bubble away through nascent oxygen just like nascent iodine and
[02:14:30.420 --> 02:14:35.300]  actually iodine and oxygen work hand-in-hand together now is oxygen FDA
[02:14:35.300 --> 02:14:41.780]  approved as oxygen is dangerous like carbon dioxide in the atmosphere it's
[02:14:41.780 --> 02:14:46.060]  evil Algor said so yeah I'm just waiting for when they when somebody gets a patent
[02:14:46.060 --> 02:14:49.620]  on oxygen I mean that's then they're gonna start selling this oxygen in big
[02:14:49.620 --> 02:14:54.740]  tanks because the oxygen concentration has gone from 28% in the air 100 years
[02:14:54.740 --> 02:15:00.780]  ago down to like 9 and even 6% in some cities I mean lack of iodine lack of
[02:15:00.780 --> 02:15:04.740]  oxygen that's just that just equals disease right there now that's a
[02:15:04.740 --> 02:15:11.500]  conspiracy theory you're saying we need oxygen we die without oxygen that is a
[02:15:11.500 --> 02:15:15.900]  conspiracy theory well no now they're saying it's a conspiracy theory that
[02:15:15.900 --> 02:15:20.180]  children need to be breastfed but but listen they know that we need oxygen so
[02:15:20.180 --> 02:15:23.980]  why not spray a bunch of aluminum now that's your opinion doctor that's your
[02:15:23.980 --> 02:15:28.420]  like that's your opinion the carbon dioxide is what plants breathe we need
[02:15:28.420 --> 02:15:33.460]  we need to cut the carbon dioxide well you know the plants all the plants emit
[02:15:33.460 --> 02:15:38.260]  oxygen and they take in our carbon dioxide it's a whole ecosystem so as we
[02:15:38.260 --> 02:15:41.980]  breathe as long as we have enough plants is another reason why I recommend
[02:15:41.980 --> 02:15:45.700]  everybody put live plants around their house because they can increase their
[02:15:45.700 --> 02:15:50.180]  oxygen and decrease the carbon dioxide that they're breathing out I mean inside
[02:15:50.180 --> 02:15:54.060]  of homes and inside of buildings is a major issue those are the most toxic
[02:15:54.060 --> 02:15:58.540]  places in most cases because yeah of course I was being sarcastic just just
[02:15:58.540 --> 02:16:02.820]  going after carbon dioxide is like going after oxygen but they're doing it and
[02:16:02.820 --> 02:16:07.460]  look at these these these hospitals where you where it's a wrong record they've
[02:16:07.460 --> 02:16:11.780]  got the superbugs they're dirty there's no life in them look at the rates of
[02:16:11.780 --> 02:16:18.300]  doctors dying and Dennis dying I mean it is so toxic well I asked the question
[02:16:18.300 --> 02:16:23.300]  still you know why do why don't hospitals have good air purification systems in
[02:16:23.300 --> 02:16:28.740]  them I mean you know that's a that's a whole another thing there should not be
[02:16:28.740 --> 02:16:36.220]  any type of problems within hospitals it's very easy to rectify with air
[02:16:36.220 --> 02:16:41.940]  purification and even microbial spray solutions instead of using the alcohol
[02:16:41.940 --> 02:16:46.060]  based solutions that they're using for cleansing they have new probiotic
[02:16:46.060 --> 02:16:49.740]  cleansing solutions that they can spray on there that actually put microbes that
[02:16:49.740 --> 02:16:54.100]  attack any type of MRSA or any type of infectious organisms that are in the
[02:16:54.100 --> 02:16:57.500]  hospitals I mean hospitals should be the cleanest places we go I don't even go
[02:16:57.500 --> 02:17:01.060]  in hospitals because if I go in there I'm gonna walk out with a sore throat and
[02:17:01.060 --> 02:17:05.460]  everybody that goes in there pretty much walks out sick almost I mean I hardly
[02:17:05.460 --> 02:17:09.780]  ever get sick unless I visit care unless I visit family or somebody in a
[02:17:09.780 --> 02:17:13.300]  hospital I immediately get sick two days later I know and look at how many
[02:17:13.300 --> 02:17:18.340]  hospitals are being built all over the place I mean we have a sick nation we
[02:17:18.340 --> 02:17:24.220]  have a sick world and you know hopefully with your help and all the stuff that
[02:17:24.220 --> 02:17:27.380]  we're doing on a daily basis I mean we're just educating people and people
[02:17:27.380 --> 02:17:30.700]  are waking up well you're doing a superlative job and I just want to
[02:17:30.700 --> 02:17:34.740]  invite all of the TV viewers and radio listeners and it ends up supporting the
[02:17:34.740 --> 02:17:39.740]  broadcast my philosophy is I go out I do research on how to get healthy it's for
[02:17:39.740 --> 02:17:42.620]  over a decade fighting the globalist I just didn't care and got totally unhealthy
[02:17:42.620 --> 02:17:46.820]  I people could see I got a little bit healthier lost some weight you know trying
[02:17:46.820 --> 02:17:52.540]  to exercise and of all the things I've done nascent iodine was just absolutely
[02:17:52.540 --> 02:17:57.860]  amazing so we developed with Dr. Group a double strength low price instead of
[02:17:57.860 --> 02:18:00.780]  giving there's so many groups out there folks I did research that just shall
[02:18:00.780 --> 02:18:05.780]  crud at super high prices my plan with infowarslife.com is our first
[02:18:05.780 --> 02:18:10.140]  product that nascent iodine atomic iodine is to have the highest quality
[02:18:10.140 --> 02:18:14.140]  products and that's why I like his philosophy with Dr. Group I've even
[02:18:14.140 --> 02:18:17.260]  signed agreements for all the stuff he's gonna develop for me to have a low
[02:18:17.260 --> 02:18:20.180]  price which is great I'm like of course I'll sign an agreement to have a low
[02:18:20.180 --> 02:18:23.220]  price with these products you're gonna help me with because that's my plan our
[02:18:23.220 --> 02:18:26.980]  philosophy is just the same I hope that you'll teach myself and my listeners
[02:18:26.980 --> 02:18:30.580]  everything you know doctor. Absolutely I mean that's why I'm here to spread the
[02:18:30.580 --> 02:18:36.340]  word that's the whole mission and you know we want everybody to be healthy we
[02:18:36.340 --> 02:18:39.260]  want everybody to be clean because if everybody is clean and they know how
[02:18:39.260 --> 02:18:45.500]  easy it is to detoxify their body they can wake themselves back up. Infowarslife.com
[02:18:45.500 --> 02:18:50.660]  survival shield the atomic nascent iodine available right now and there'll
[02:18:50.660 --> 02:18:54.260]  be more products coming up ones being formulated manufactured right now we're
[02:18:54.260 --> 02:18:58.700]  not going to give it away yet but this is this is something original isn't it? I
[02:18:58.700 --> 02:19:05.740]  tell you what what you came up with the idea for this product that you're
[02:19:05.740 --> 02:19:11.140]  gonna be launching is going to be incredible and I'm excited about it. Like when we told
[02:19:11.140 --> 02:19:15.580]  you you said why didn't I think of that? No I was like no one has ever done this
[02:19:15.580 --> 02:19:24.060]  before ever and it's probably the biggest rectifying without giving away too
[02:19:24.060 --> 02:19:26.980]  much information it's probably the most important thing that people can be doing
[02:19:26.980 --> 02:19:33.340]  with iodine to help support the body and the detoxification. Here's a little
[02:19:33.340 --> 02:19:37.140]  hint this detoxifies fluoride on record but the thing that we're coming out with
[02:19:37.140 --> 02:19:40.700]  is going to supercharge it. That's going to supercharge it. Wow get about your
[02:19:40.700 --> 02:19:45.420]  website again. GlobalHealingCenter.com. Wow. Alright Dr. Group thank you so much
[02:19:45.420 --> 02:19:48.460]  buddy. Thanks for having me on here. Thank you. Thank you for driving all the way in
[02:19:48.460 --> 02:19:52.300]  from outside Houston to do this. Amazing. We'll be right back with Lord Christopher
[02:19:52.300 --> 02:19:56.780]  Monks and I promise we'll get Sasha, Dr. Gonob and John and others that love
[02:19:56.780 --> 02:20:00.420]  Obama. In fact let's go to them next and then get Lord Monks on the bottom of the
[02:20:00.420 --> 02:20:03.940]  hour. Every time you eat a cooked food your body responds by producing an
[02:20:03.940 --> 02:20:07.660]  increase in circulating white blood cells. This happens because nature designed
[02:20:07.660 --> 02:20:12.380]  us to eat food that is undamaged at the molecular level. When we heat food to
[02:20:12.380 --> 02:20:15.900]  normal cooking temperatures we change the shape of the molecules into shapes
[02:20:15.900 --> 02:20:20.900]  the body cannot use. The body now looks at them as toxins and allergens. In an
[02:20:20.900 --> 02:20:24.100]  effort to protect itself from this irritant the body intelligently
[02:20:24.100 --> 02:20:27.780]  increases the amount of circulating white blood cells to act as garbage
[02:20:27.780 --> 02:20:31.700]  collectors. White blood cells gobble up all the unusable damaged food particles
[02:20:31.700 --> 02:20:35.300]  to neutralize their cell damaging properties. This puts stress on your
[02:20:35.300 --> 02:20:39.020]  organs of elimination and your body is subject to cell damage and inflammation.
[02:20:39.020 --> 02:20:43.260]  If you'd like to start experiencing the benefits of undamaged protein in your
[02:20:43.260 --> 02:20:48.540]  diet give one world way a try. It is a truly undamaged protein powder that will

[02:21:31.900 --> 02:21:35.020]  wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about
[02:21:35.020 --> 02:21:39.340]  gold IRAs? They've been available since 1986 yet the financial industry won't
[02:21:39.340 --> 02:21:43.020]  recognize the value of gold for your retirement. Gold has outperformed paper

[02:21:59.620 --> 02:22:03.580]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world
[02:22:03.580 --> 02:22:07.660]  on health care? Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet? The
[02:22:07.660 --> 02:22:13.700]  highest rates of diabetes, autism and every other major disease? It all comes
[02:22:13.700 --> 02:22:18.780]  down to one thing. We are what we eat. Our food is devoid of nutrition and
[02:22:18.780 --> 02:22:23.940]  processed with poisons and additives. Our water is filled with toxic poisons and
[02:22:23.940 --> 02:22:29.020]  big pharma runoff. All of this has been engineered by design. We can turn the
[02:22:29.020 --> 02:22:33.060]  tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body

[02:23:04.820 --> 02:23:09.420]  your lives upside down in the coming few months. Unbelievably the media are
[02:23:09.420 --> 02:23:13.660]  keeping quiet about this. I'm sure they know it but they probably know that
[02:23:13.660 --> 02:23:18.940]  revealing it on TV will generate mass hysteria and chaos. But I believe you
[02:23:18.940 --> 02:23:22.740]  should be informed about it because when the sinister agenda is finally
[02:23:22.740 --> 02:23:27.300]  accomplished and everything unravels only those who know this secret info will
[02:23:27.300 --> 02:23:34.340]  survive and thrive. Go to 123conspiracy.com right now to see the truth. The
[02:23:34.340 --> 02:23:41.300]  video at 123conspiracy.com reveals the real secret reason why Obama is after
[02:23:41.300 --> 02:23:46.020]  your guns and ammo. And it's not just in response to mass murders of preparing for
[02:23:46.020 --> 02:23:52.700]  war, it's something much darker. Go watch the video now at 123conspiracy.com
[02:23:52.700 --> 02:24:13.020]  before they shut it down. Again that's 123conspiracy.com. Whether it's the
[02:24:13.020 --> 02:24:21.140]  New York Times, whether it's the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the
[02:24:21.140 --> 02:24:28.100]  Associated Press, you name it, the headlines are replete everywhere. Global
[02:24:28.100 --> 02:24:32.260]  warming believers are feeling the heat. That's the London Telegraph today with
[02:24:32.260 --> 02:24:36.740]  James Dillingpole. As Germany gets caught at working with the White House to
[02:24:36.740 --> 02:24:42.460]  try to block news that all of their climate models are manifest frauds, that
[02:24:42.460 --> 02:24:46.740]  they have been trying to keep the fraud from the public. Now for our longtime
[02:24:46.740 --> 02:24:51.420]  listeners, you're gonna go tell us something we don't know. We heard your
[02:24:51.420 --> 02:24:55.260]  guest on 10 years ago about the climate models being a fraud. The last five
[02:24:55.260 --> 02:25:00.340]  years, six years, we probably heard Lord Monkton 50 times on your show with his
[02:25:00.340 --> 02:25:04.500]  science and public policy website showing the documents. He's the guy that
[02:25:04.500 --> 02:25:08.780]  helped get out the emails showing climate gate fraud. He's the guy that helped
[02:25:08.780 --> 02:25:12.220]  bring out the fact of Pechari heading up the climate deal, was shutting down
[02:25:12.220 --> 02:25:15.660]  plants in England, shipping them to where he owned them in India. It's a
[02:25:15.660 --> 02:25:19.980]  deindustrialization move to China and India where the globalists are in
[02:25:19.980 --> 02:25:24.020]  control, with robber barons on top of it. I want to go to Lord Monkton instead of
[02:25:24.020 --> 02:25:28.340]  seeing his praises. The point is he's been a devastating technician of liberty
[02:25:28.340 --> 02:25:34.420]  with the sort of truth slaying massive dragons. And he's a rock star to me. I
[02:25:34.420 --> 02:25:37.540]  mean people that are effective against tyrants, because I take these tyrants
[02:25:37.540 --> 02:25:41.540]  personal what they're doing, doubling my power prices in Austin, shutting down all
[02:25:41.540 --> 02:25:45.860]  our clean-burning plants, brainwashing kids, ignoring all the hundreds of real
[02:25:45.860 --> 02:25:50.980]  environmental issues that are real problems. Big oil and the Saudis funding
[02:25:50.980 --> 02:25:54.980]  the shutdown of coal because it's competition to them. You know, I want to
[02:25:54.980 --> 02:25:59.020]  use our energy resources. I don't want to go to Saudi Arabia. And I'm sick of being
[02:25:59.020 --> 02:26:03.100]  told I work for oil companies when it's the opposite. They work for oil companies.
[02:26:03.100 --> 02:26:07.380]  So Lord Monkton joins us. This is a short segment, long segment coming up. He's
[02:26:07.380 --> 02:26:10.780]  always somewhere different. He goes to these big climate conferences. But this
[02:26:10.780 --> 02:26:15.820]  is the excuse to take over the world by taxing the carbon cycle. And it's bigger
[02:26:15.820 --> 02:26:20.100]  than climategate. That it's a concerted fraud. They've known it's a fraud. I mean
[02:26:20.100 --> 02:26:25.100]  folks, they take the sun out of the models, okay? I mean it's ridiculous.
[02:26:25.100 --> 02:26:28.780]  They've been caught faking the temperature readings. And now it's all
[02:26:28.780 --> 02:26:33.380]  admitted they are routed politically, but they don't care. They're still going
[02:26:33.380 --> 02:26:37.100]  forward. Lord Monkton, we only got four minutes to break, but how big is what's
[02:26:37.100 --> 02:26:42.460]  happened? I mean, this, I think this is champagne time right now. Alex, you're
[02:26:42.460 --> 02:26:47.620]  right. The scare is over, but not that they're going to admit it just yet. Here
[02:26:47.620 --> 02:26:53.340]  they are just about to come up with yet another of these big multi-thousand page
[02:26:53.340 --> 02:26:58.900]  lie-packed documents, trying to say that it's all terrible. It's worse than ever.
[02:26:58.900 --> 02:27:02.940]  We thought the sky is falling. The sky is falling. This is chicken little on a
[02:27:02.940 --> 02:27:08.460]  grand scale. But the truth is that it's all over by the shouting. They've now had
[02:27:08.460 --> 02:27:14.740]  to admit that for 16, getting on for 17 years, there has been no global warming
[02:27:14.740 --> 02:27:19.820]  at all. None of their models predicted that. So the models are now completely out
[02:27:19.820 --> 02:27:25.300]  of the window. They've also had to admit that the consensus that they try to tell
[02:27:25.300 --> 02:27:32.620]  us with 95% confidence is 97% of all scientists. It now turns out on a careful
[02:27:32.620 --> 02:27:42.100]  measurement by their own side to be 0.3%. That's all it is. 0.3% of all the
[02:27:42.100 --> 02:27:50.820]  11,944. The complete polar opposite. 180 degree difference. Correct. It's 0.3%.
[02:27:50.820 --> 02:27:56.100]  There's now no doubt about this because this survey was done by their own people
[02:27:56.100 --> 02:28:00.260]  trying to prove there was a consensus. When they published it, they said it's
[02:28:00.260 --> 02:28:07.420]  97.1%. But in a peer reviewed paper, I and others did the homework. We got hold
[02:28:07.420 --> 02:28:12.980]  of the author's own data file and we found that they had marked only 0.3%
[02:28:12.980 --> 02:28:20.300]  of all the papers as in fact saying that yes, most of the warming since 1950 was
[02:28:20.300 --> 02:28:24.060]  caused by us. And here's the big one for me. Let's put the daily mail up. Even the
[02:28:24.060 --> 02:28:28.860]  BBC had to admit this. Top global warming scientists caught in meetings
[02:28:28.860 --> 02:28:33.820]  desperately trying to hide the decline, not just in the emails, but now in
[02:28:33.820 --> 02:28:40.300]  government conferences. It's extraordinary how they have tried to deny. I mean, if you
[02:28:40.300 --> 02:28:44.740]  want to talk about who the climate deniers are, these are the people who
[02:28:44.740 --> 02:28:47.860]  have been trying to tell us global warming is terrible and it's getting
[02:28:47.860 --> 02:28:53.740]  worse. And the fact is that according to the RSS satellite data set, there has
[02:28:53.740 --> 02:29:00.780]  been no global warming at all for 16 years, 10 months. That's a lot of months
[02:29:00.780 --> 02:29:05.220]  now. There's been no global warming at all. Zero. And Lord Christopher
[02:29:05.220 --> 02:29:08.660]  Monton, now they've flipped though. I want to come back from break. And now
[02:29:08.660 --> 02:29:13.500]  they're saying global freezing, which actually might be true if we don't get
[02:29:13.500 --> 02:29:18.780]  the carbon dioxide level up, correct? That is indeed always possible. And all the
[02:29:18.780 --> 02:29:22.940]  solar physicists and now several mathematicians who've done some work on
[02:29:22.940 --> 02:29:27.860]  the cumulative influence of the sun are saying we could be in for some very
[02:29:27.860 --> 02:29:32.860]  serious global cooling just in the next two or three years. It is a possibility.
[02:29:32.860 --> 02:29:37.660]  That's not good. Boy, I tell you, especially with food production slipping
[02:29:37.660 --> 02:29:40.580]  thanks to all the carbon taxes and stuff. We're going to have a lot of starving
[02:29:40.580 --> 02:29:43.980]  people. If that happens, we'll be right back with Lord Christopher Monton. We'll
[02:29:43.980 --> 02:29:51.820]  break down how to defeat these criminals. We're on the march. The
[02:29:51.820 --> 02:29:58.780]  Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.100 --> 02:30:04.180]  My friends Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important
[02:30:04.180 --> 02:30:07.780]  information concerning you and your family's health. Radiation levels have
[02:30:07.780 --> 02:30:11.660]  more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the
[02:30:11.660 --> 02:30:15.740]  nuclear testing and radiological accidents. Radioactive contamination is
[02:30:15.740 --> 02:30:19.980]  now in most of the food supply. There's only two ways to avoid this. Move south
[02:30:19.980 --> 02:30:24.540]  of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine. Looking to
[02:30:24.540 --> 02:30:28.700]  protect my family, I've done deep research. Nascent iodine is the purest,
[02:30:28.700 --> 02:30:33.100]  cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family. It's
[02:30:33.100 --> 02:30:38.180]  made right here in the USA completely non-GMO. I searched out the best quality
[02:30:38.180 --> 02:30:42.660]  and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine exclusively
[02:30:42.660 --> 02:30:47.940]  available at InfoWarsLife.com. Nascent iodine is on record as one of the
[02:30:47.940 --> 02:30:53.060]  only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning. Survival Shield nascent iodine.

[02:31:54.260 --> 02:32:02.860]  silver lung system. That's www.silverlungs.com The world is discovering the
[02:32:02.860 --> 02:32:07.340]  power of medicinal silver to fight against life-threatening pathogens and as
[02:32:07.340 --> 02:32:11.780]  a result, dozens of silver solutions have emerged. You can even make your own
[02:32:11.780 --> 02:32:15.900]  colloidal silver at home in your garage. How do you know which solution is the
[02:32:15.900 --> 02:32:20.500]  safest and most effective? Supernatural silver is a new patented technology
[02:32:20.500 --> 02:32:25.980]  that is made using 10,000 volts of AC current. This technology is so powerful
[02:32:25.980 --> 02:32:30.700]  it must be made in a laboratory. Colloidal and ionic silvers use a charge of
[02:32:30.700 --> 02:32:35.860]  only 110 volts of DC current, making supernatural silver hundreds of times
[02:32:35.860 --> 02:32:41.380]  more effective against viruses, bacteria and fungus. Supernatural silver liquid
[02:32:41.380 --> 02:32:46.180]  can be used internally and our silver gel can be used topically. To find out more

[02:33:25.780 --> 02:33:29.860]  Alright, I'm going to go to the Obamacare supporters after Lord Moncton
[02:33:29.860 --> 02:33:33.780]  leaves us at the end of this segment. I appreciate John and Sasha and Dr.
[02:33:33.780 --> 02:33:38.740]  Goblet or whatever his name is for holding the toll-free number to join us on
[02:33:38.740 --> 02:33:45.060]  air is 800-259-9231. I want to hear from you. We've heard I'm poor, I'm
[02:33:45.060 --> 02:33:48.380]  destitute, I want free health care. You already get free health care. You can
[02:33:48.380 --> 02:33:50.860]  already go in charity care. Now they're going to ruin everybody's health care.
[02:33:50.860 --> 02:33:54.700]  I want to get Lord Moncton's take on socialist health care because he's
[02:33:54.700 --> 02:33:58.860]  lived under it in England. He's in England right now but he is the global
[02:33:58.860 --> 02:34:04.300]  leading champion of truth when it comes to exposing the power grab that ignores
[02:34:04.300 --> 02:34:09.300]  all the real environmental issues and sets up the UN and select Goldman Sachs,
[02:34:09.300 --> 02:34:15.260]  JP Morgan, Ken Lay of Enron with Al Gore develop the plan to tax carbon dioxide.
[02:34:15.260 --> 02:34:20.940]  There's four things in the life cycle. Sunlight, water, carbon dioxide, oxygen.
[02:34:20.940 --> 02:34:25.100]  You've got to have those four things. Well you got to have a heat source. Sometimes
[02:34:25.100 --> 02:34:27.580]  it's volcanic heat but then you got to have the other three, the water, the
[02:34:27.580 --> 02:34:31.500]  carbon dioxide, the oxygen. But for general life on the planet it's the sun
[02:34:31.500 --> 02:34:38.500]  and the UN's done stuff like five years ago vote to say we exclude the sun as an
[02:34:38.500 --> 02:34:41.220]  engine because Lord Moncton and others were pointing out as well as top
[02:34:41.220 --> 02:34:47.340]  climatologists that it was the sun. Stupid. Not carbon dioxide and that and
[02:34:47.340 --> 02:34:54.500]  then Al Gore had lied and reversed the graphs and they're still up there saying
[02:34:54.500 --> 02:34:58.340]  polar bears can't swim on CNN and they're all dead basically when their numbers
[02:34:58.340 --> 02:35:01.460]  are five-fold. So Lord Moncton in the ten minutes we've got left with you. I
[02:35:01.460 --> 02:35:06.980]  appreciate you joining us today. I want to get into how they're striking back
[02:35:06.980 --> 02:35:11.420]  what you expect them to do because even though this is all a fraud they still
[02:35:11.420 --> 02:35:15.540]  brainwashed the kids. They're still putting carbon taxes. They're still
[02:35:15.540 --> 02:35:20.420]  moving in major cities in the US to put you in coffin size apartments 200
[02:35:20.420 --> 02:35:25.260]  square feet and charge you huge carbon city taxes. I mean they're still going
[02:35:25.260 --> 02:35:30.420]  forward even though they've been caught as frauds. This is exactly the thing
[02:35:30.420 --> 02:35:36.900]  these people do not know when they ought to let go and this could be the end of
[02:35:36.900 --> 02:35:41.860]  worldwide bureaucratic centralist socialism communism fascism call it
[02:35:41.860 --> 02:35:47.620]  what you like. The idea that governments know best the bureaucrats know best that
[02:35:47.620 --> 02:35:53.140]  idea has now been proven false by the fact that they call this global warming
[02:35:53.140 --> 02:35:57.300]  the most certain thing they'd ever said. It was all the science was certain it's
[02:35:57.300 --> 02:36:02.180]  all set and it's all over. It now turns out they were 180 degrees wrong. Every
[02:36:02.180 --> 02:36:07.060]  single fact they told us about was incorrect. Adding carbon dioxide to an
[02:36:07.060 --> 02:36:12.580]  atmosphere like ours will be expected to cause some warming. That's well understood
[02:36:12.580 --> 02:36:16.260]  and has been for a couple of hundred years but here's the point. What isn't
[02:36:16.260 --> 02:36:20.780]  well understood as they've now found out is how much or rather how little
[02:36:20.780 --> 02:36:26.260]  warming that carbon dioxide is actually going to cause. We now know that it's not
[02:36:26.260 --> 02:36:30.940]  causing very much. No warming at all for 17 years and not much likelihood of it
[02:36:30.940 --> 02:36:34.860]  and you were talking Alex quite rightly about the sun. Let me tell you what's
[02:36:34.860 --> 02:36:40.300]  happened to the sun. 300 years ago it went through 70 years when there was
[02:36:40.300 --> 02:36:46.380]  virtually no sunspots. Now that hasn't happened like that for 11,400 years
[02:36:46.380 --> 02:36:51.060]  since the end of the last ice age. It was really cold then. The Hudson in New
[02:36:51.060 --> 02:36:55.220]  York, the Thames over here in the UK froze over in the winter. They had
[02:36:55.220 --> 02:36:59.300]  frost fairs on the Thames. Dutch artists came who did landscapes. They came and
[02:36:59.300 --> 02:37:02.860]  painted them. You can get the pictures in the National Gallery. We know that it
[02:37:02.860 --> 02:37:08.100]  was cold then. Then the sun began to become active again and from 1695 to
[02:37:08.100 --> 02:37:15.220]  1735, a period of 40 years, the warming happened so rapidly not only in England
[02:37:15.220 --> 02:37:19.580]  but we think right around the world that global temperatures will have risen at a
[02:37:19.580 --> 02:37:24.900]  rate equivalent to four Celsius degrees or six and a half Fahrenheit degrees
[02:37:24.900 --> 02:37:29.820]  per century. A real rapid warming before the Industrial Revolution began.
[02:37:29.820 --> 02:37:34.940]  Nothing to do with us. The sun went on gathering its activity so we've now had
[02:37:34.940 --> 02:37:41.820]  300 years of global warming and of course it's warmer now than it was in 1695
[02:37:41.820 --> 02:37:46.020]  because it's been getting warmer all that time and you would expect the warmer
[02:37:46.020 --> 02:37:49.660]  weather to be at the end of that period not at the beginning. Nothing unusual
[02:37:49.660 --> 02:37:54.780]  about that. Point is though that that warming seems to have stopped. The sun
[02:37:54.780 --> 02:38:00.620]  reached a peak of activity in 1960, a peak almost as high as it reached at any
[02:38:00.620 --> 02:38:06.540]  time in the last 11,400 years. So the sun suddenly a lot more active and now it's
[02:38:06.540 --> 02:38:11.220]  begun to decline and to decline quite a bit. Result, even though we've added some
[02:38:11.220 --> 02:38:15.420]  carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, even though that has no doubt contributed a
[02:38:15.420 --> 02:38:20.100]  little bit to global warming, it hasn't in the last 17 years because the sun is
[02:38:20.100 --> 02:38:24.740]  now in decline again and it's the sun. Of course it's the sun stupid as you said
[02:38:24.740 --> 02:38:28.980]  rightly said Alex. That's what dominates the climate. That after all is where the
[02:38:28.980 --> 02:38:32.700]  heat comes from. There's just that little bit less heat coming from the sun
[02:38:32.700 --> 02:38:37.540]  than there usually is and already the global temperatures are responding. The
[02:38:37.540 --> 02:38:42.660]  bureaucrats and scientists got it wrong. They were overconfident. They wanted our
[02:38:42.660 --> 02:38:47.660]  money and our taxes and control over our lives just too much to stand back and be
[02:38:47.660 --> 02:38:51.780]  rational and get this one right and produce balance reports. They're still
[02:38:51.780 --> 02:38:56.820]  at it. There's fifth big assessment report by the UN's climate panel. Here it
[02:38:56.820 --> 02:39:01.740]  comes again with all the same rubbish in it. They're now claiming 95% confidence
[02:39:01.740 --> 02:39:07.940]  that more than half of the global warming since 1950 was caused by us. But
[02:39:07.940 --> 02:39:13.300]  here's the thing, Alex, there's been about 0.7 Celsius degrees or one
[02:39:13.300 --> 02:39:18.420]  Fahrenheit, just over one Fahrenheit of global warming over the whole of the
[02:39:18.420 --> 02:39:25.900]  last 63 years since 1950 and that means that in absolute terms the temperature
[02:39:25.900 --> 02:39:33.140]  of the earth has changed. Get this by one quarter of one percent. One quarter of
[02:39:33.140 --> 02:39:39.220]  one percent is the total warming of the earth in absolute terms since 1950. That's
[02:39:39.220 --> 02:39:42.700]  all. Is that something extreme? Is that something worrying? Is that something
[02:39:42.700 --> 02:39:47.580]  doing damaging? No, of course it's not. It's entirely within what is called the
[02:39:47.580 --> 02:39:51.420]  natural variability of the climate. Now Lord Monkton had something to do with
[02:39:51.420 --> 02:39:56.820]  that, but not much. Sure, sure, Lord Monkton. Our listeners follow scienceandpublicpolicy.org.
[02:39:56.820 --> 02:40:01.820]  They're aware that you didn't use lies to counter their lies. You use truth and I
[02:40:01.820 --> 02:40:05.500]  don't know how you've gotten it so incredibly right. For folks that haven't
[02:40:05.500 --> 02:40:09.460]  followed it, you are a scientist in your own right, journalist,
[02:40:09.460 --> 02:40:13.660]  advisor Margaret Thatcher on national policy, really her top advisor. It's been
[02:40:13.660 --> 02:40:17.380]  reported. So you're a really smart guy in your own right. You don't toot your horn.
[02:40:17.380 --> 02:40:23.500]  So we understand their frauds. I want to ask you how you expect them to strike
[02:40:23.500 --> 02:40:29.700]  back and how you think we should counter them because they don't care. They're
[02:40:29.700 --> 02:40:33.580]  just moving forward. So what do we do? I mean, look at all the people that have
[02:40:33.580 --> 02:40:38.380]  called for your arrest. They've called for my arrest. They've said that we need
[02:40:38.380 --> 02:40:44.380]  green fascism. They've sued countless scientists that didn't agree with them.
[02:40:44.380 --> 02:40:49.100]  And I don't expect these. I mean, look at David Attenborough coming out and saying
[02:40:49.100 --> 02:40:53.780]  last week that we need to starve the third world. I mean, these people know
[02:40:53.780 --> 02:40:58.380]  they're not really liberals. They're conscious, malthusian eugenicists. So
[02:40:58.380 --> 02:41:03.500]  how do we counter such a vicious group? I think the first thing is we turn the
[02:41:03.500 --> 02:41:07.500]  tables on them. They have been threatening to put us on trial for what
[02:41:07.500 --> 02:41:11.820]  are called high crimes against humanity. The penalty for that, of course, is death.
[02:41:11.820 --> 02:41:16.380]  But we are not the people doing the killing here. We are not the people who
[02:41:16.380 --> 02:41:20.380]  have been putting energy prices up so that people are dying of a cold in their
[02:41:20.380 --> 02:41:23.380]  homes because they can't afford to turn the heating up here in the winter in
[02:41:23.380 --> 02:41:28.260]  Scotland. We don't do that. They do. So I think we turn the tables on them. There
[02:41:28.260 --> 02:41:35.220]  is a law and the law says that if you commit fraud by deliberately deceiving
[02:41:35.220 --> 02:41:39.820]  people on a matter such as a scientific question like global warming and either
[02:41:39.820 --> 02:41:45.540]  you make money out of it yourselves or, and it could be either, you make other
[02:41:45.540 --> 02:41:50.460]  people suffer loss and come to harm because of the fraud, the deception that
[02:41:50.460 --> 02:41:55.540]  you have caused, then you can go to jail for that for a very long time. And that's
[02:41:55.540 --> 02:42:00.380]  what we've now got to do. For instance, if somebody comes along and says it's a
[02:42:00.380 --> 02:42:07.900]  97.1% consensus that global warming over the last 60 years is mostly caused by
[02:42:07.900 --> 02:42:14.460]  us and the actual figures in the papers that they surveyed marked by them is that
[02:42:14.460 --> 02:42:20.580]  it's only 0.3%, 0.5%, some tiny fraction like that. And they're trying to say it's
[02:42:20.580 --> 02:42:26.300]  97.1%. Well, there's only one word for that, Alex, isn't there? And there's only
[02:42:26.300 --> 02:42:30.500]  one place that people who perpetrate fraud like that. Let's use the word.
[02:42:30.500 --> 02:42:34.780]  Fraud is what it is. There's only one place where people like that ought to go.
[02:42:34.780 --> 02:42:39.220]  And it is the Calaboso and they should go there for quite a long time because
[02:42:39.220 --> 02:42:44.460]  they are doing real harm to not just the economy of the West but to the
[02:42:44.460 --> 02:42:49.580]  livelihoods and lives of people who depend on getting affordable energy and
[02:42:49.580 --> 02:42:53.740]  now they can't afford it because the prices have been put up to subsidize
[02:42:53.740 --> 02:42:57.940]  these bird-blending, back-blatting windmills that generate practically no
[02:42:57.940 --> 02:43:01.700]  electricity, destabilize the grid and cost a fortune doing it. Now Lord
[02:43:01.700 --> 02:43:05.620]  Monkton, I understand to bring this nonsense to a very firm end in the
[02:43:05.620 --> 02:43:10.180]  courts. You know, I think you're being too kind to them because if you look at the
[02:43:10.180 --> 02:43:13.660]  mainstream news, the admissions that the scientists met with the UN, the German
[02:43:13.660 --> 02:43:19.580]  government, the US government and others and said, we've got to cover this up to
[02:43:19.580 --> 02:43:27.020]  get money. I mean, that's beyond fraud. That's organized criminal meetings to
[02:43:27.020 --> 02:43:31.500]  defraud people. You're right, it's fraud but it's beyond just knowingly lying to
[02:43:31.500 --> 02:43:35.460]  people. As you said, it's to get money and even if they could say they didn't
[02:43:35.460 --> 02:43:40.540]  know before and they were just wrong, it's the premeditated meeting to now
[02:43:40.540 --> 02:43:46.060]  cover it up when it involves government bodies. This sounds like organized
[02:43:46.060 --> 02:43:50.580]  conspiracy to me and that's a serious felony. I know our law is based on UK
[02:43:50.580 --> 02:43:56.060]  law, based on old English law. I mean, what's the specifics here? I mean, we
[02:43:56.060 --> 02:44:01.580]  need to move immediately to have them clapped in irons. Well, I think you have
[02:44:01.580 --> 02:44:06.180]  in the United States a law that goes beyond even our law. You have the
[02:44:06.180 --> 02:44:11.740]  racketeer influenced corrupt organizations law, the RICO statute. You've
[02:44:11.740 --> 02:44:14.820]  probably seen the film, the black and white film about RICO who got caught in
[02:44:14.820 --> 02:44:19.380]  the end, the organized gangster, the hood. These people are hoods and you're
[02:44:19.380 --> 02:44:23.340]  quite right at a recent meeting in Stockholm where they were deciding on
[02:44:23.340 --> 02:44:28.380]  the final form of the IPCC's latest blockbuster report about the climate, a
[02:44:28.380 --> 02:44:34.540]  UN report. The Germans as well as the Hungarians came out and said that they
[02:44:34.540 --> 02:44:39.060]  didn't want anyone admitting there's been no global warming for 17 years
[02:44:39.060 --> 02:44:43.900]  because if that was admitted then it might mean the skeptics would prevail
[02:44:43.900 --> 02:44:48.900]  and the last thing they want is to allow the truth to come through so they
[02:44:48.900 --> 02:44:52.940]  deliberately tried to suppress it and when you do that at government level you
[02:44:52.940 --> 02:44:58.100]  openly call for real-world data to be suppressed in the way that we saw data
[02:44:58.100 --> 02:45:01.820]  were being suppressed at the University of East Anglia and many other
[02:45:01.820 --> 02:45:05.620]  universities, the University of Colorado and States, the University of Virginia,
[02:45:05.620 --> 02:45:08.900]  the Penn State University, all these places where they've been bending the
[02:45:08.900 --> 02:45:13.220]  data, destroying the data, hiding the data, fiddling the data, all of these
[02:45:13.220 --> 02:45:18.860]  people working together as we know they did via the Climate Gate 10,000 emails
[02:45:18.860 --> 02:45:22.380]  where we caught them talking to each other about suppressing papers they
[02:45:22.380 --> 02:45:25.300]  didn't like delaying their publication in the journals, preventing their
[02:45:25.300 --> 02:45:29.580]  publication in the journals, doing them down, having their chance. This is
[02:45:29.580 --> 02:45:34.460]  authoritarianism persecution. This is authoritarianism just like we have the
[02:45:34.460 --> 02:45:40.780]  IRS caught being ordered to harass Tea Party groups. I mean these are real
[02:45:40.780 --> 02:45:46.580]  authoritarians. It is exactly that and the point is they think and they still
[02:45:46.580 --> 02:45:50.660]  think that they can get away with this because they are the government or they
[02:45:50.660 --> 02:45:55.180]  have the support of the government but certainly in the British courts and I
[02:45:55.180 --> 02:45:59.740]  still think in one or two of the American courts there are judges there who
[02:45:59.740 --> 02:46:04.180]  are sufficiently independent minded that if you went to them as we did with
[02:46:04.180 --> 02:46:09.020]  Al Gore's movie to the High Court in London and even though we had a judge
[02:46:09.020 --> 02:46:13.940]  who had once been a candidate for the then governing Labour Party and we put
[02:46:13.940 --> 02:46:19.660]  in front of him the fact of the errors all the way through Gore's movie he
[02:46:19.660 --> 02:46:25.980]  found that if they hadn't agreed to publish 77 pages of corrective guidance
[02:46:25.980 --> 02:46:31.100]  to Gore's movie circulated to every school in England then the education
[02:46:31.100 --> 02:46:33.940]  department, the government department in charge of education in this country
[02:46:33.940 --> 02:46:38.780]  would not have been allowed to show that movie. We won in court because that's
[02:46:38.780 --> 02:46:43.460]  where the bullshit stops. Once they realize that they're going to be in
[02:46:43.460 --> 02:46:48.380]  court and they're going to be in a forum where both sides are fairly heard
[02:46:48.380 --> 02:46:51.820]  where they don't command the judge and control the judge in the way they
[02:46:51.820 --> 02:46:56.580]  command and control the mainstream media that's the moment when they realize as
[02:46:56.580 --> 02:47:01.180]  they did then the moment they saw the scientific testimony or 80 pages of it
[02:47:01.180 --> 02:47:06.660]  that I had drafted in that case they took one look at that and they caved in
[02:47:06.660 --> 02:47:10.940]  because they knew they couldn't lie in front of the judge or we would have
[02:47:10.940 --> 02:47:15.220]  pointed the lies out and they would have gone to jail for perjury so they
[02:47:15.220 --> 02:47:19.540]  suddenly had to fess up and tell the truth and after months of pretending to
[02:47:19.540 --> 02:47:22.980]  us in the answers to our pleadings that they were telling the truth they
[02:47:22.980 --> 02:47:27.140]  suddenly admitted they weren't that Gore's film was indeed full of errors
[02:47:27.140 --> 02:47:32.300]  and they apologized for it and said voluntarily that they would issue 77
[02:47:32.300 --> 02:47:37.100]  pages of corrective guidance and only then did the judge allow the film to be
[02:47:37.100 --> 02:47:41.660]  shown and he awarded four hundred thousand dollars in costs to the plaintiff
[02:47:41.660 --> 02:47:45.740]  a lorry driver from Darkford whose two kids in school did not want to be
[02:47:45.740 --> 02:47:50.060]  propagandized if you want my guess this is now going to move from the civil court
[02:47:50.060 --> 02:47:54.940]  where that was to a criminal court and we're going to start seeing people all
[02:47:54.940 --> 02:48:01.660]  over the world prosecuted for one or two very specific instances of serious
[02:48:01.660 --> 02:48:06.660]  criminal fraud tampering with data publishing the wrong results being told
[02:48:06.660 --> 02:48:10.700]  they've published the wrong results and refusing to withdraw them upon the of
[02:48:10.700 --> 02:48:16.220]  the error being drawn to their attention and that is deception that is fraud I
[02:48:16.220 --> 02:48:21.020]  think we're now going to start seeing just one or two prosecutions that's all
[02:48:21.020 --> 02:48:25.460]  it's going to take Alex you put a couple of scientists behind bars who thought
[02:48:25.460 --> 02:48:30.780]  that their white coats and their fancy degrees from posh universities made them
[02:48:30.780 --> 02:48:35.380]  somehow immune from prosecution from the same fraud laws that apply to the rest
[02:48:35.380 --> 02:48:39.740]  of us when they get that real surprise and find out that if they do
[02:48:39.740 --> 02:48:44.100]  deliberately bogus scientific research and deliberately refused to correct it
[02:48:44.100 --> 02:48:48.460]  when they're caught out if they find that they can go to jail for that just
[02:48:48.460 --> 02:48:53.380]  like you and me the rest of them will gallop for cover and that and only then
[02:48:53.380 --> 02:48:56.940]  that will be the end of this and I want to be specific none of us want to put
[02:48:56.940 --> 02:49:00.940]  them in jail but they're authoritarians who've been lying and if they get the
[02:49:00.940 --> 02:49:04.460]  global carbon taxes at many conservative estimates I know or a billion
[02:49:04.460 --> 02:49:09.420]  would die in a decade we're trying to stop some very dangerous Malthusians who
[02:49:09.420 --> 02:49:14.180]  are on record many of them being eugenicist and it's a very very creepy
[02:49:14.180 --> 02:49:18.620]  to see them getting away with this I mean I see cases all the time where green
[02:49:18.620 --> 02:49:22.860]  police now they have all over the country state police you name it find a
[02:49:22.860 --> 02:49:26.300]  battery in your yard that fell out of one of your children's toys and you're
[02:49:26.300 --> 02:49:29.700]  given a ten thousand dollar fine or the case of the man charged with felonies
[02:49:29.700 --> 02:49:33.660]  for endangering the environment for letting go a heart balloon for his
[02:49:33.660 --> 02:49:37.740]  girlfriend in Florida last time I read that prosecutions going forward they
[02:49:37.740 --> 02:49:44.500]  admit this is going to be their new selective prosecution against the
[02:49:44.500 --> 02:49:49.660]  public these are ravenous authoritarians who want to bring in a rain of
[02:49:49.660 --> 02:49:54.500]  socialist communistic terror on the public I mean they've had you beaten
[02:49:54.500 --> 02:49:57.740]  up going to a venture accredited to they've they've called for your arrest
[02:49:57.740 --> 02:50:01.540]  it's on video police punching you in the back of the head for no reason I mean
[02:50:01.540 --> 02:50:05.580]  I've been around these people as well they know it's all a fraud and they
[02:50:05.580 --> 02:50:11.180]  are we know they know the game is up I was in Australia earlier this year on a
[02:50:11.180 --> 02:50:15.660]  four-month speaking tour I met farmers in South Australia and one of these
[02:50:15.660 --> 02:50:21.140]  farmers had a really interesting story to tell they came and hid behind his shed
[02:50:21.140 --> 02:50:27.540]  for days and they eventually spotted him taking water from his neighbor's creek
[02:50:27.540 --> 02:50:34.740]  and using it to supply his cattle who needed water and they swooped in a
[02:50:34.740 --> 02:50:39.100]  pickup truck they knocked him over and injured him they damaged both his
[02:50:39.100 --> 02:50:44.340]  physical and his mental health then while he was still in hospital recovering
[02:50:44.340 --> 02:50:46.980]  from hold on I got to hear this on the other side of them are going to overdrive

[02:55:27.420 --> 02:55:32.540]  Vox and I want to finish the story on the farmers and the people being attacked
[02:55:32.540 --> 02:55:36.060]  especially in Australia that's the farthest along in all this where you
[02:55:36.060 --> 02:55:39.780]  just spent months but then I want to briefly talk about socialist health care
[02:55:39.780 --> 02:55:43.420]  what it's like living under it in England the UK and Scotland go ahead Lord
[02:55:43.420 --> 02:55:47.540]  Monkton dead right let's start then first of all with this case in Australia
[02:55:47.540 --> 02:55:51.340]  the farmer taking water from his own neighbor's Creek the neighbor was was
[02:55:51.340 --> 02:55:55.580]  happy with that he had an agreement with the neighbor it turned out he also had
[02:55:55.580 --> 02:55:59.220]  permission in writing from the government to do that but they didn't
[02:55:59.220 --> 02:56:04.820]  care they made a mistake they drove him down in their ute three of them they
[02:56:04.820 --> 02:56:09.540]  left him for dead they drove away they got to the court before he did and they
[02:56:09.540 --> 02:56:13.660]  said he'd been taking water illegally the court without hearing his side of the
[02:56:13.660 --> 02:56:19.460]  case find him 35 thousand dollars and this is what you're talking about these
[02:56:19.460 --> 02:56:25.020]  savage fines he however being a tough independent minded Australian farmer
[02:56:25.020 --> 02:56:29.580]  simply refused to pay so the court hauled him up again and said right you've
[02:56:29.580 --> 02:56:35.180]  got to do 360 hours community service and here's the thing Alex gradually the
[02:56:35.180 --> 02:56:39.980]  bureaucrats themselves are realizing this just isn't right and so when he
[02:56:39.980 --> 02:56:44.620]  turned up for his community service they said no just quietly go away we
[02:56:44.620 --> 02:56:49.940]  won't tell the judge if you don't you needn't do that service it's clear that
[02:56:49.940 --> 02:56:54.540]  you have been harshly treated that you have done no wrong go away and God bless
[02:56:54.540 --> 02:56:59.540]  you so there is some humanity creeping back into the system I'm delighted to
[02:56:59.540 --> 02:57:04.300]  see it and of course we also know that in Australia Tony Abbott to whom I gave
[02:57:04.300 --> 02:57:08.820]  detailed briefings on climate change many years ago and who has said that it's
[02:57:08.820 --> 02:57:13.060]  rubbish he used a slightly blunter word than that but he said it's rubbish he
[02:57:13.060 --> 02:57:17.340]  has now become the prime minister of Australia he's already shut down the
[02:57:17.340 --> 02:57:22.340]  lying fiddling climate commission which was putting out propaganda and calling
[02:57:22.340 --> 02:57:27.460]  itself independent and you should hear the moaning and bedwetting by the BBC
[02:57:27.460 --> 02:57:31.380]  and all these other organizations the ABC about how terrible it was that this
[02:57:31.380 --> 02:57:36.020]  so-called independent commission that was pushing out propaganda for the labor
[02:57:36.020 --> 02:57:40.540]  government that's now been defeated has been swept away great news one minute
[02:57:40.540 --> 02:57:43.940]  one minute one minute sir on government-run health care the nightmare

[03:00:29.580 --> 03:00:36.420]  I'll just go back to four hours but Paul Watson who's never really sick a few
[03:00:36.420 --> 03:00:41.540]  years ago at a chest cold I talked to him seven days a week generally back and
[03:00:41.540 --> 03:00:44.780]  forth about news developments and he couldn't breathe he couldn't come on the
[03:00:44.780 --> 03:00:49.580]  air it took him about three weeks to be technical a little over three weeks to
[03:00:49.580 --> 03:00:54.300]  get in to see the doctor in national healthcare I mean he he went to the
[03:00:54.300 --> 03:00:57.780]  clinic they would say here's the little national health service pack it's
[03:00:57.780 --> 03:01:05.900]  Kleenex Tylenol aspirin a little container of like nickel type stuff and
[03:01:05.900 --> 03:01:12.740]  he talked about it and then it got worse and worse and worse and and he would be
[03:01:12.740 --> 03:01:17.620]  on the phone just groaning saying sorry I can't get to any work I'm trying to get
[03:01:17.620 --> 03:01:21.060]  in I'm trying to get into and I said look don't they have private clinics
[03:01:21.060 --> 03:01:26.340]  because I know how the system works I said don't they have private clinics for
[03:01:26.340 --> 03:01:31.380]  you to be able to like the elite do over there go see me goes yeah but first the
[03:01:31.380 --> 03:01:36.540]  health service has to sign off for the permission to go and the elite
[03:01:36.540 --> 03:01:41.100]  automatically get that it's all about the power of the bureaucrats well finally
[03:01:41.100 --> 03:01:45.620]  when he came on air and talked about it somehow he gets a call in the word oh
[03:01:45.620 --> 03:01:49.140]  you can come on in and he had a really bad bacterial infection and got
[03:01:49.140 --> 03:01:56.180]  antibiotics I mean he could have died folks I watch C-span see these Obama
[03:01:56.180 --> 03:01:58.860]  supporters were going to in the next segment this is a short segment I'm
[03:01:58.860 --> 03:02:01.380]  going to the next time I give you plenty of time folks so stay there I
[03:02:01.380 --> 03:02:11.100]  appreciate you holding they don't watch C-span I do and I love because it's so
[03:02:11.100 --> 03:02:15.460]  entertaining late at night sometimes well every week they air Prime Minister's
[03:02:15.460 --> 03:02:20.340]  questions but they air other debates on C-span 2 or C-span 3 of the parliament
[03:02:20.340 --> 03:02:26.100]  and I'll sit there halfway reading the book halfway watching and I'll watch two
[03:02:26.100 --> 03:02:30.900]  hours of a parliamentary procedure this is so interesting and I'm telling you
[03:02:30.900 --> 03:02:33.900]  the number one thing they talk about is when Tony Blair was in especially they'd
[03:02:33.900 --> 03:02:38.100]  get up and say my constituents are waiting a month to have their heart
[03:02:38.100 --> 03:02:42.220]  looked at after a heart attack they're laying on stretches dying sometimes two
[03:02:42.220 --> 03:02:47.620]  days people that get infections die of gangrenious infections and don't
[03:02:47.620 --> 03:02:51.060]  don't give in treatment and Tony Blair and then others after and we get up and
[03:02:51.060 --> 03:02:55.740]  say I know it's true we need more funding but it's still a great service and we
[03:02:55.740 --> 03:03:00.180]  need to blah blah blah on and on but the big ones you could pull up news
[03:03:00.180 --> 03:03:04.260]  articles on this they'd make you wait 18 months for a brain surgery for a tumor
[03:03:04.260 --> 03:03:08.140]  that was almost a hundred percent operable meaning they can get rid of it
[03:03:08.140 --> 03:03:12.140]  if you have the surgery in a month they make you wait 18 months and with one
[03:03:12.140 --> 03:03:19.380]  tumor it turned out nobody survives at 18 months a death sentence Canada is
[03:03:19.380 --> 03:03:25.060]  horrible on record I know people who've lost husbands and wives trying to get
[03:03:25.060 --> 03:03:30.380]  infections worked on England is the worst there's a few European countries
[03:03:30.380 --> 03:03:35.340]  like Norway or Sweden Japan's National Health Service is pretty good because
[03:03:35.340 --> 03:03:39.100]  they're not completely criminally run and if you got money you can go to the
[03:03:39.100 --> 03:03:43.220]  private clinics and hospitals that are nicer but if you don't people pay taxes
[03:03:43.220 --> 03:03:46.420]  you can actually go get health care now they do have euthanasia they are
[03:03:46.420 --> 03:03:49.740]  bringing in the death panels down the road it's gonna be bad but I'll be honest
[03:03:49.740 --> 03:03:54.340]  there's some social health care works it ain't gonna be this one folks that's
[03:03:54.340 --> 03:04:01.380]  what I'm trying to tell you the way this thing is written is a screwjob and you
[03:04:01.380 --> 03:04:07.380]  heard Lord Moncton talking about how where he lives up in Scotland and I saw
[03:04:07.380 --> 03:04:11.620]  this in the news a few weeks ago they are suspending period ambulance
[03:04:11.620 --> 03:04:17.620]  services after seven at night and the hospitals are closing due to budgetary
[03:04:17.620 --> 03:04:23.420]  cuts folks people complain about American health care and it's become
[03:04:23.420 --> 03:04:28.060]  corrupt in the HMOs rationing care and all the scams folks it's gonna get 50
[03:04:28.060 --> 03:04:33.060]  times worse now and people say oh we'll let it get worse that's what the
[03:04:33.060 --> 03:04:37.020]  Republican leader of the Senate Mitch McConnell saying the plan is to wreck it
[03:04:37.020 --> 03:04:42.980]  and then bring in total socialism when that fails where I'll have to get
[03:04:42.980 --> 03:04:49.060]  permission to go to a private clinic you're saying oh no the private clinics
[03:04:49.060 --> 03:04:53.460]  will just take you know the government health care no folks the way it's written
[03:04:53.460 --> 03:04:56.700]  they're going out to small clinics and shutting them down with the regulations
[03:04:56.700 --> 03:05:01.900]  this is written by the big outfits to shut down their competition why does the
[03:05:01.900 --> 03:05:05.500]  United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on
[03:05:05.500 --> 03:05:09.700]  health care why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet the highest

[03:08:06.820 --> 03:08:09.700]  radio network
[03:08:13.180 --> 03:08:18.580]  all right I appreciate them being absolute stalwart Trojans and holding
[03:08:18.580 --> 03:08:22.900]  lovingly I got to be honest I took four or five calls from Obamacare
[03:08:22.900 --> 03:08:27.580]  supporters earlier in the broadcast today we open the phones up and they
[03:08:27.580 --> 03:08:33.100]  were all really nice people that had reasonable reasons for wanting national
[03:08:33.100 --> 03:08:39.340]  health care the problem is the people running it are sucking it dry and
[03:08:39.340 --> 03:08:44.100]  running it as a scam to ration care with the death panels and all the rest of it
[03:08:44.100 --> 03:08:47.380]  just like all the other free deals people thought they'd get with Obama
[03:08:47.380 --> 03:08:52.460]  he's here to really bamboozle people I didn't support Bush either I was at but
[03:08:52.460 --> 03:08:56.380]  Obama is better at conning people that's why the insurance companies and
[03:08:56.380 --> 03:09:04.060]  people backing and we're in deep trouble but let's go ahead and hear from
[03:09:04.060 --> 03:09:07.660]  people here to understand why they support it you know it's funny when
[03:09:07.660 --> 03:09:11.100]  an arrogant person calls in like yesterday some social worker and is
[03:09:11.100 --> 03:09:15.260]  laughing at me saying I'm basically full of it because then then you know then
[03:09:15.260 --> 03:09:18.660]  it's a nasty government person who thinks they're God but these people that are
[03:09:18.660 --> 03:09:22.260]  poor and just want better health care it's so sad the problem is they're gonna
[03:09:22.260 --> 03:09:26.580]  get worse health care now it's a big lie folks the hospitals lie to you they
[03:09:26.580 --> 03:09:31.500]  have to render care by law and and and they are responsible when they send you
[03:09:31.500 --> 03:09:34.580]  away and they I don't want to get into the whole history of health care I
[03:09:34.580 --> 03:09:38.980]  already did it let's just go to your calls to be informed and to know they're
[03:09:38.980 --> 03:09:42.340]  wrecking the system on purpose like everything else like education you
[03:09:42.340 --> 03:09:49.380]  name it like the drug war it's not a failure it's a success the drug dealers
[03:09:49.380 --> 03:09:54.260]  made the drugs illegal to make more money on a black market I mean it's so
[03:09:54.260 --> 03:09:59.980]  elementary this is an evil globalist group they shouldn't be running health
[03:09:59.980 --> 03:10:03.340]  care see I say I'm gonna listen to these people but then it's like I start
[03:10:03.340 --> 03:10:08.660]  preaching because it's so frustrating it's very frustrating it's very frustrating
[03:10:08.660 --> 03:10:12.220]  the people perish for lack of knowledge it was a guy called an earlier who heads
[03:10:12.220 --> 03:10:16.140]  up a senior citizens group in Phoenix nice old black guy I sound like and he's
[03:10:16.140 --> 03:10:19.940]  Alex I like your show but these old people they need better health care and
[03:10:19.940 --> 03:10:24.180]  and I go hey do you think lottery tickets are good he goes well I know
[03:10:24.180 --> 03:10:32.740]  they're a scam but they give you hope it's I mean it's like what what it's
[03:10:32.740 --> 03:10:37.420]  like it's like buying into the delusion because I guess these people feel like
[03:10:37.420 --> 03:10:41.540]  they're such failures that maybe it might work they like like the hope of
[03:10:41.540 --> 03:10:45.980]  imagining and I've run into so many dreamers they're like this just in life
[03:10:45.980 --> 03:10:54.100]  and business everything they never do anything they just imagine that they're
[03:10:54.100 --> 03:10:57.660]  gonna be rock stars and they go play a little bars around town why don't you
[03:10:57.660 --> 03:11:01.060]  just be happy to be a musician and if you ever become a big star that's great
[03:11:01.060 --> 03:11:05.660]  by the way becoming a big stars hellish you don't even probably want it the
[03:11:05.660 --> 03:11:11.020]  point is it's they're so lost and it's the same reason Nigerian email scams
[03:11:11.020 --> 03:11:16.740]  have been working since the mid-1990s almost 20 years you get an email saying
[03:11:16.740 --> 03:11:24.900]  give me $5,000 I will give you 15 million I am Prince of Booby and people go a
[03:11:24.900 --> 03:11:29.380]  lot and notice it's tailored for folks that scrounge together 5,000 to get the
[03:11:29.380 --> 03:11:32.780]  maximum number to cut and then okay here's the instructions you can't talk

[03:11:47.660 --> 03:11:52.580]  are quality and then Mrs. Johnson sends the 5,000 and then her family tells her
[03:11:52.580 --> 03:11:56.780]  it's a Ponzi scheme they're gonna try to get more money now hoping that you know
[03:11:56.780 --> 03:12:01.340]  I'm sorry the wiring will take 10,000 more and you they know you're 5,000 when
[03:12:01.340 --> 03:12:06.660]  now you're already five years into Obamacare you're 5,000 in the Nigerian
[03:12:06.660 --> 03:12:13.740]  phone scam email scam you're like well I did talk to the Prince's attache Lord
[03:12:13.740 --> 03:12:19.220]  Abu boo or whatever the stupid made-up name is and then and then they go to the
[03:12:19.220 --> 03:12:23.180]  family the family has a big fight they put 10 grand in and sometimes this goes
[03:12:23.180 --> 03:12:29.780]  three or four times they mortgage houses 50 grand is sent to a boo boo and
[03:12:29.780 --> 03:12:35.380]  sometimes people break up families break up over this one scam alone they and they
[03:12:35.380 --> 03:12:41.060]  say there is no way that I've been scammed and then it's like we're very
[03:12:41.060 --> 03:12:45.500]  sorry the Prince has been detained by his enemies we told you we'll be back in
[03:12:45.500 --> 03:12:49.780]  touch soon my darling is usually women they con my darling will soon be back in

[03:13:00.220 --> 03:13:09.060]  Obamacare written by the eugenicist that have big consortium meetings bragging
[03:13:09.060 --> 03:13:13.540]  how they're cheating everyone all right let's talk to the victims Sasha in
[03:13:13.540 --> 03:13:19.900]  California you support Obamacare tell me about it hi Alex a couple of things we
[03:13:19.900 --> 03:13:24.460]  gonna have me like maybe 20 minutes first of all I want to thank you much
[03:13:24.460 --> 03:13:28.660]  respect and love to you and your family through Mike Adams I learned all the
[03:13:28.660 --> 03:13:34.020]  stuff I had diabetes you know so I go to doctor and he gives me just a few like
[03:13:34.020 --> 03:13:37.540]  four or five medicine I've never taken medicine in my life anything like that
[03:13:37.540 --> 03:13:41.300]  you know never been sick so okay now I know that I have diabetes it's like
[03:13:41.300 --> 03:13:47.100]  457 on the one they tested me what normally should be like in a hundred
[03:13:47.100 --> 03:13:53.740]  110 so yeah give you medication and right after like two three days after I
[03:13:53.740 --> 03:13:59.860]  start like really literally going blind oh and I'm hooked man and the doctor
[03:13:59.860 --> 03:14:04.460]  believe me is my grandpa's doctor and if you know again but nice guy like he
[03:14:04.460 --> 03:14:07.780]  would never be intended no he doesn't know yeah he's thinking about the golf
[03:14:07.780 --> 03:14:13.300]  course so long story short you learn what for Mike Adams well you can reverse
[03:14:13.300 --> 03:14:18.620]  diabetes and now I'm back to normal numbers and again it's that again oh now
[03:14:18.620 --> 03:14:24.460]  they won't get to what wait till it's do you have type one or type two type one
[03:14:24.460 --> 03:14:29.420]  also now and if you go too long it is hard to reverse from the literature I've
[03:14:29.420 --> 03:14:33.140]  seen but they didn't have a chance to kill you and have you go blind well I'm
[03:14:33.140 --> 03:14:36.860]  sure they're gonna roll in anger over that and again the numbers of people
[03:14:36.860 --> 03:14:39.780]  with diabetes is off the charts are estimating like half of America will
[03:14:39.780 --> 03:14:44.580]  have it soon think by 2020 but but no one's asking why it's up it's just we
[03:14:44.580 --> 03:14:48.820]  need to truth is the vaccines burn out your pancreas and amongst other things
[03:14:48.820 --> 03:14:55.500]  the fluoride the rest of it but the look that's what's scary for a lot of people
[03:14:55.500 --> 03:14:59.460]  there are treatments and nutritional things that really do reverse really do
[03:14:59.460 --> 03:15:02.900]  do it and the system doesn't want you knowing that now sir did you really call
[03:15:02.900 --> 03:15:07.780]  in about supporting Obamacare yes you know why because okay check this out
[03:15:07.780 --> 03:15:11.860]  okay same people who are on the healthcare industry you know the insurance
[03:15:11.860 --> 03:15:15.260]  companies I guarantee you they own the fast food and the junk food that they
[03:15:15.260 --> 03:15:18.980]  feed people so at both ends you know that you get you get people sick of your
[03:15:18.980 --> 03:15:22.100]  feet actually Bill Gates does own a big part of health care and health care
[03:15:22.100 --> 03:15:25.660]  management and development and he does he is the biggest owner of McDonald's
[03:15:25.660 --> 03:15:31.060]  and Monsanto no it's true yeah it was breaking the windshields of you know
[03:15:31.060 --> 03:15:34.220]  cars and then but but I'm gonna take the figure that out that hello you know
[03:15:34.220 --> 03:15:38.300]  this guy's feeding his own the big business needs so it's the same thing I
[03:15:38.300 --> 03:15:41.740]  guarantee you if no one has thought of this I'm sure if it hasn't happened that
[03:15:41.740 --> 03:15:45.820]  they would do it now so in that case let's just buy stocks and invest in our
[03:15:45.820 --> 03:15:49.660]  demise I mean that that's the only reason you would support this I mean
[03:15:49.660 --> 03:15:53.700]  whatever the government brings out and my cousin is a CEO of a bigger hospital
[03:15:53.700 --> 03:15:58.180]  chain over here in Southern California and when I kind of jokingly at that time
[03:15:58.180 --> 03:16:02.220]  I wasn't I wasn't still look fully that kind of that haha you know and then when
[03:16:02.220 --> 03:16:06.300]  I told him he's you know I mean he's the CEO of a major you know hospital
[03:16:06.300 --> 03:16:11.460]  chain and he called it a rationing as in like it's not rape it's like you know
[03:16:11.460 --> 03:16:15.540]  like different kind of love me it's like again these people are not me I mean
[03:16:15.540 --> 03:16:21.860]  they know better I mean I'm not nobody special I haven't been to it I guess it's
[03:16:21.860 --> 03:16:26.180]  the more you get indoctrinated the more I guess you have invested in the
[03:16:26.180 --> 03:16:30.580]  story doesn't sound like you support Obamacare I appreciate your call how am
[03:16:30.580 --> 03:16:34.580]  I gonna get to the people that actually support it John in Florida are you a real
[03:16:34.580 --> 03:16:43.580]  supporter yeah I am a supporter Alex do you also believe a Nigerian emails pardon
[03:16:43.580 --> 03:16:49.180]  never mind go ahead tell me why yours yeah okay here's here's the deal okay you
[03:16:49.180 --> 03:16:53.620]  know I'm not poor Alex okay I make a decent living as a matter of fact I pay
[03:16:53.620 --> 03:16:57.740]  more for health insurance premiums than most people make I also pay more in
[03:16:57.740 --> 03:17:02.340]  federal income taxes than most people make okay let me explain some to you
[03:17:02.340 --> 03:17:07.660]  okay the reason why the insurance companies have set it up where you buy
[03:17:07.660 --> 03:17:11.820]  your health insurance from your employer is because they know one of two things
[03:17:11.820 --> 03:17:16.100]  is gonna happen okay if you get really sick or somebody in your family gets
[03:17:16.100 --> 03:17:21.940]  really sick what ends up happening is you end up losing your job 18 they're
[03:17:21.940 --> 03:17:26.260]  gonna put John Cobra half the people out there can't pay for it so bingo they're
[03:17:26.260 --> 03:17:30.460]  off claim right there or they're on Medicaid okay for the ones that can pay
[03:17:30.460 --> 03:17:36.460]  for it in 18 months they're done okay now I live in Florida in Florida use a
[03:17:36.460 --> 03:17:40.940]  guaranteed issue as long as you didn't have a lapse in coverage okay you get a
[03:17:40.940 --> 03:17:45.940]  guaranteed issue okay so I got a guaranteed issue I pay double because
[03:17:45.940 --> 03:17:53.460]  they underwrite that rightfully so because who takes a guaranteed issue only
[03:17:53.460 --> 03:17:59.380]  people who are who have issues okay I was rated up 200% for minor skin
[03:17:59.380 --> 03:18:04.300]  cancers that I have okay all kinds of things the bottom line we are all rated
[03:18:04.300 --> 03:18:08.900]  up everybody in my family's rated up okay we pay through the nose for this
[03:18:08.900 --> 03:18:14.500]  stuff I'm paying for that guy that you talk about okay that goes in there and
[03:18:14.500 --> 03:18:19.180]  he doesn't have any coverage that's why I'm paying what I'm paying not only are
[03:18:19.180 --> 03:18:24.980]  my premiums high okay but I have no sir no sir your premiums are high because
[03:18:24.980 --> 03:18:28.240]  they're cheating you because you actually buy insurance and now they're gonna
[03:18:28.240 --> 03:18:31.740]  cheat everybody because you're forced to buy it and your cost just watch
[03:18:31.740 --> 03:18:36.060]  fact maybe Mitch McConnell's right let's let this go in and let's just gonna
[03:18:36.060 --> 03:18:40.060]  wreck everything and the public won't even remember a year from now they'll
[03:18:40.060 --> 03:18:43.820]  just say the answers total socialism and then my premium will be low then I'll
[03:18:43.820 --> 03:18:48.140]  pay nothing don't understand government and regulations at this level when
[03:18:48.140 --> 03:18:52.780]  you're a corrupt country never works it takes everything over why do you think
[03:18:52.780 --> 03:18:56.900]  the insurance companies are supporting this you're not being fair you don't let
[03:18:56.900 --> 03:19:00.860]  me get a word in edgewise hold on a minute bud hold on but that's not true
[03:19:00.860 --> 03:19:05.740]  you just talked about business and money and how you're paying more and
[03:19:05.740 --> 03:19:09.980]  hospitals were supposed to do about a third of their work for charity for free
[03:19:09.980 --> 03:19:15.500]  they're getting rid of charity care they do have death panels this is what's
[03:19:15.500 --> 03:19:21.460]  happened under Socialist Healthcare everywhere sir you don't work for free
[03:19:21.460 --> 03:19:25.980]  they don't work for free that's the way it goes if you don't have the money
[03:19:25.980 --> 03:19:31.220]  they'll let you die no and zips or butts about nope that's not true news for you
[03:19:31.220 --> 03:19:37.380]  that is not true your family was sick okay and it was live or die buddy okay
[03:19:37.380 --> 03:19:41.340]  you'd be the first one to line up there and take what they got hey listen I'm
[03:19:41.340 --> 03:19:44.500]  gonna tell you something right now you're very emotional I'm let's skip this
[03:19:44.500 --> 03:19:49.340]  break kill this break I'm gonna go to the bottom of the hour with you you know
[03:19:49.340 --> 03:19:54.260]  sir you're very emotional about this and they've lied to you they told you that
[03:19:54.260 --> 03:19:57.860]  once this comes in that people with pre-existing conditions and things that
[03:19:57.860 --> 03:20:01.420]  your premiums are gonna go down or that you won't be denied they had they
[03:20:01.420 --> 03:20:06.100]  admitted day one that's not true now and I guess you just don't believe me I
[03:20:06.100 --> 03:20:11.300]  pointed out that the insurance companies wrote this and it freaked you out and so
[03:20:11.300 --> 03:20:17.540]  you just said you don't let me get a word in edgewise are you denying that the
[03:20:17.540 --> 03:20:21.580]  globalist wrote this and that the insurance companies lobbied for it hey
[03:20:21.580 --> 03:20:26.180]  that's right sure they did they also lobbied they also lobbied to have your
[03:20:26.180 --> 03:20:31.900]  employer pay to to provide it to you okay this doesn't go far enough man okay
[03:20:31.900 --> 03:20:35.940]  you know what else they ought to get rid of the employer mandate get rid of it
[03:20:35.940 --> 03:20:40.620]  well why not listen Alex why not get your groceries from your employer why
[03:20:40.620 --> 03:20:44.580]  don't you do that why don't you buy your car from your employer well you're just
[03:20:44.580 --> 03:20:48.380]  hung up listen listen here's the deal I'm a major I think a major employer 40
[03:20:48.380 --> 03:20:52.540]  plus people I'm gonna tell you something right now bud I have studied this
[03:20:52.540 --> 03:20:56.540]  healthcare thing up one side and down the other I understand the current
[03:20:56.540 --> 03:21:01.020]  systems a screw job but just because you're in a frying pan doesn't mean
[03:21:01.020 --> 03:21:05.780]  jumping into a furnace is better I mean do you understand what I'm saying to you
[03:21:05.780 --> 03:21:10.300]  because that's the only way the cost will come down where you can go into a
[03:21:10.300 --> 03:21:16.180]  hospital or go to a doctor and not get reamed okay the only way that happens is
[03:21:16.180 --> 03:21:19.980]  you have to you have to do one or the other you either have to have everybody
[03:21:19.980 --> 03:21:22.860]  in the pool or none and that's right and that's right and that's right and that's
[03:21:22.860 --> 03:21:27.820]  right and you just came down to the bottom line Bill Gates said it he said
[03:21:27.820 --> 03:21:32.140]  it two years ago he said there are death panels we've got to let grandma die to
[03:21:32.140 --> 03:21:36.420]  hire 10 teachers and this is the nightmare once they collectivize even
[03:21:36.420 --> 03:21:40.660]  partially the last 50 years then it's unfair and the answer is collectivize
[03:21:40.660 --> 03:21:44.380]  everything and then you find out it's a total trap this is what
[03:21:44.380 --> 03:21:47.820]  domestication is all about I'm gonna explain something to you the United
[03:21:47.820 --> 03:21:53.500]  States up until the 1950s on record and the 60s had hands down the best
[03:21:53.500 --> 03:21:57.640]  healthcare in the world the best developments the British Royalty the
[03:21:57.640 --> 03:22:03.060]  Saudi Royalty and they all the Japanese Royalty all came to Houston Texas all
[03:22:03.060 --> 03:22:08.700]  came to Dallas Texas all came to Los Angeles and New York City on the on
[03:22:08.700 --> 03:22:13.180]  record to get and I've had a bunch of family that were physicians doctors you
[03:22:13.180 --> 03:22:17.380]  name it they all came here I mean I mean you take Dr. Group he's not making
[03:22:17.380 --> 03:22:21.280]  that up that he's treated the Royal Family of England in Houston at his
[03:22:21.280 --> 03:22:27.780]  his facility that's all gonna be gone brother okay I know for a fact under the
[03:22:27.780 --> 03:22:32.220]  National Health Services it is a living hell and social engineering I know for
[03:22:32.220 --> 03:22:37.380]  a fact you don't get a knee surgery after 60 your eye surgery I know for a
[03:22:37.380 --> 03:22:41.740]  fact that it's gonna be private with the corporations and insurance companies
[03:22:41.740 --> 03:22:47.020]  running it with the government with the ethics panels and and they're gonna tell
[03:22:47.020 --> 03:22:50.580]  you we are getting rid of old ladies we are denying health care
[03:22:50.580 --> 03:22:57.820]  until you can't get ambulance service after seven o'clock at night until all
[03:22:57.820 --> 03:23:02.300]  you get is like Cuba they do your blood pressure and whatever I mean man I've
[03:23:02.300 --> 03:23:08.740]  studied this and you're all angry getting screwed being an employer as if I
[03:23:08.740 --> 03:23:12.860]  don't know how that is I mean I was talking to Professor Griffin it's in
[03:23:12.860 --> 03:23:16.060]  the upcoming Obama deception to he has a small business and he says he can
[03:23:16.060 --> 03:23:19.500]  barely run it he just runs it as the defiance thing the way the things are
[03:23:19.500 --> 03:23:23.580]  written where you cannot even make money I just spend all day trying to make
[03:23:23.580 --> 03:23:27.020]  money to pay to get the word out and instead of being able just to get the
[03:23:27.020 --> 03:23:31.980]  word out it's very very frustrating and I don't just get up here listen there's a
[03:23:31.980 --> 03:23:37.580]  reason the Republicans wrote that legislation along with the Democratic
[03:23:37.580 --> 03:23:43.860]  leadership and they got Obama to sell it okay and and I'll never forget being on
[03:23:43.860 --> 03:23:50.100]  an airplane and reading this whole like 15-page Wall Street Journal report right
[03:23:50.100 --> 03:23:55.700]  before Obamacare passed you know three years ago or whatever it was I was flying
[03:23:55.700 --> 03:24:02.100]  back from Los Angeles that was New York and I was reading it and it was the head
[03:24:02.100 --> 03:24:08.420]  of the insurance lobbying association at the exact name and he was saying at the
[03:24:08.420 --> 03:24:11.820]  group meeting in front of reporters some of you smaller insurance companies
[03:24:11.820 --> 03:24:16.220]  aren't for this look we wrote this we're going to be able to control the care and
[03:24:16.220 --> 03:24:22.940]  what care is given and lower the price for us and make 35 million people buy it
[03:24:22.940 --> 03:24:27.060]  and that's only in the first year of implementation this is going to be a
[03:24:27.060 --> 03:24:34.180]  bonanza and that's what it is so the system's been screwed up with government
[03:24:34.180 --> 03:24:40.740]  involvement the last 40 years now it's going to be 10 times worse and now I'm
[03:24:40.740 --> 03:24:45.100]  gonna shut up give you two minutes John go ahead or boner has either one of
[03:24:45.100 --> 03:24:49.620]  these people come up with it said look we can either do it one of two ways we
[03:24:49.620 --> 03:24:53.460]  can either have insurance or we can have no insurance but you can't have it in
[03:24:53.460 --> 03:24:57.540]  between because you can't okay because either everybody's got to be in it or
[03:24:57.540 --> 03:25:02.460]  nobody's in it it can't be any other way oh no no you have chair listen sir did
[03:25:02.460 --> 03:25:06.340]  you know that I think the last number was over 75% of hospitals or charities
[03:25:06.340 --> 03:25:13.020]  but they're not charities they're big Rockefeller on record owned and okay
[03:25:13.020 --> 03:25:17.660]  okay you're not listening to me sir you may even get a bill down the road you
[03:25:17.660 --> 03:25:22.940]  don't that is a lie okay you you have to get on the list for charity care or you
[03:25:22.940 --> 03:25:28.700]  come in an emergency and what you're saying is false let you die man okay
[03:25:28.700 --> 03:25:32.180]  that's all there is put him on hold put him on hold sir you are just ignorant
[03:25:32.180 --> 03:25:37.060]  Ron Paul's a medical doctor he'll tell you what I just told you dr. Russell
[03:25:37.060 --> 03:25:40.100]  Blalock medical doctor tell you the same thing my dad's a dentist herald
[03:25:40.100 --> 03:25:45.620]  surgeon tell you the same thing they are under this getting rid of that Ron Paul
[03:25:45.620 --> 03:25:53.060]  worked two days a week down in South Texas and then four days a week out of
[03:25:53.060 --> 03:25:59.140]  the Air Force for a decade at a upscale hospital and then two days a week did
[03:25:59.140 --> 03:26:04.940]  his duty it's a high priest duty if you go back to the Hippocratic Oath and all
[03:26:04.940 --> 03:26:08.300]  of it I mean he goes all the way back to Egypt folks and then all the way back
[03:26:08.300 --> 03:26:15.900]  to Greece but Hippocrates makes the name of the guy the point is is that you do
[03:26:15.900 --> 03:26:22.740]  no harm and you are taught that we charge the rich people more we charge
[03:26:22.740 --> 03:26:27.700]  the middle class us a fee where we make a good living and we give poor people
[03:26:27.700 --> 03:26:31.340]  free care and for equipment and other things we have charities that pay it and
[03:26:31.340 --> 03:26:37.380]  just like Ebenezer Scrooge and the Christmas Carol written about real
[03:26:37.380 --> 03:26:42.940]  things that happen but put in a fiction setting by one of the greatest writers
[03:26:42.940 --> 03:26:47.620]  ever Charles Dickens people came knocking on the rich people's door and
[03:26:47.620 --> 03:26:52.620]  saying we need money for the hospital fund and you put money into that that's
[03:26:52.620 --> 03:26:56.860]  how this is supposed to work that's why most the hospitals or charity hospitals
[03:26:56.860 --> 03:27:02.860]  and because they're engaged in fraud you tell me I'm full of bull that's not
[03:27:02.860 --> 03:27:09.300]  true illegal aliens those hospitals to get federal funds they put ads in the
[03:27:09.300 --> 03:27:12.700]  papers in Mexico saying come here and have your baby free they become a
[03:27:12.700 --> 03:27:16.500]  citizen you get to stay they want that money that's federal the feds have come
[03:27:16.500 --> 03:27:19.180]  in with the churches and the communities are involved and it's become
[03:27:19.180 --> 03:27:22.140]  totally corrupt now I'm gonna let you counter back sir but you're completely
[03:27:22.140 --> 03:27:26.740]  wrong oh I'm not wrong see that's what you do everybody you get oh they're
[03:27:26.740 --> 03:27:31.300]  completely wrong okay no sir I'm not completely wrong what your facts what
[03:27:31.300 --> 03:27:35.180]  your proof completely right but I'm not completely wrong and you're not
[03:27:35.180 --> 03:27:40.180]  completely right and you're not completely wrong okay no see that's
[03:27:40.180 --> 03:27:44.820]  all talk man listen can't be all right Alex how can you sit how can you sit
[03:27:44.820 --> 03:27:48.660]  there on your throne and tell me that you're all right that everything you
[03:27:48.660 --> 03:27:54.620]  say is the gospel because you have a radio show okay no sir you're not all
[03:27:54.620 --> 03:27:57.860]  together let me ask you a question how did I guess that guy first guess was a
[03:27:57.860 --> 03:28:02.460]  government worker and a social worker yesterday how do I do that I say that
[03:28:02.460 --> 03:28:08.060]  again we listen we listen to the show yesterday yeah I listen to it almost
[03:28:08.060 --> 03:28:12.420]  every day and I appreciate have you seen how many times I first guess predict
[03:28:12.420 --> 03:28:17.580]  what somebody does no I don't understand what you mean predict what
[03:28:17.580 --> 03:28:20.980]  somebody does I don't understand I could just predict by the manner all of it
[03:28:20.980 --> 03:28:24.460]  look look the point is I'm not saying I'm that smart but I've actually studied
[03:28:24.460 --> 03:28:31.020]  healthcare deeply okay so if I as a matter of fact I'm an insider I was an
[03:28:31.020 --> 03:28:34.700]  executive for one of these big companies I'm telling you the insurance
[03:28:34.700 --> 03:28:38.820]  companies know this they decide why do you think they don't even question the
[03:28:38.820 --> 03:28:44.660]  claims any sir sir you are you are saying everything I've said your sir the
[03:28:44.660 --> 03:28:48.220]  insurance companies wrote this you're saying the insurance companies screwed
[03:28:48.220 --> 03:28:53.260]  you now they're putting it down on to everybody and it's not gonna take the
[03:28:53.260 --> 03:28:58.580]  heat off the employer that off the employer the employers in on it too
[03:28:58.580 --> 03:29:03.500]  they get you as a surf now because think about it you got to work for somebody
[03:29:03.500 --> 03:29:07.980]  you're working for him for 10 20 listen we only got one minute left why are you
[03:29:07.980 --> 03:29:13.780]  for Obamacare again okay the reason why is because at least gives you some
[03:29:13.780 --> 03:29:19.340]  control okay now at least I've got multiple plans to choose from okay I
[03:29:19.340 --> 03:29:23.460]  don't have one there's only one available to me in the Florida I don't have I
[03:29:23.460 --> 03:29:27.660]  can't get a health savings account okay so I got a multiple plans and guess what
[03:29:27.660 --> 03:29:32.300]  Alex it's a whole lot cheaper why because all those people that weren't
[03:29:32.300 --> 03:29:36.460]  insured before gotta hear you look look look bottom line this is nationalization
[03:29:36.460 --> 03:29:41.100]  of healthcare by special interest and it's gonna get even worse just get ready
[03:29:41.100 --> 03:29:45.460]  I hear what you're saying it's the propaganda versus the reality I know
[03:29:45.460 --> 03:29:50.900]  these people are what they're planning get ready to grab your ankles
