[00:00.000 --> 00:11.400]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.400 --> 00:18.960]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:18.960 --> 00:22.920]  Texas Alex Jones
[00:22.920 --> 00:30.720]  what we're witnessing across the board not just here in the United States is
[00:30.720 --> 00:39.640]  the mainlining of tyranny the mainlining of naked corruption they are now all
[00:39.640 --> 00:44.560]  over the news just standardizing normalizing acting like it's completely
[00:44.560 --> 00:52.840]  normal and no big deal and saying to the public in newspapers and in different
[00:52.840 --> 01:01.440]  pundit debates on CNN MSNBC Fox News well of course the delegates decide who
[01:01.440 --> 01:10.040]  to vote for not the popular vote your vote never counted silly we never honor
[01:10.040 --> 01:15.880]  that even though they always do because in the past a person who was honorable
[01:15.880 --> 01:21.480]  would be chosen they're at the precinct level to be sent to the National
[01:21.480 --> 01:28.720]  Convention 150 years ago 60 years ago right up to today you would represent
[01:28.720 --> 01:38.160]  and carry that delegation and that vote it's a low-tech system and now they're
[01:38.160 --> 01:45.120]  spinning it I mean when we first talked about this seven eight months ago
[01:45.120 --> 01:51.120]  people really rolled their eyes and I knew that they could do it but I had
[01:51.120 --> 01:54.480]  trouble believing they try it because they didn't change the rules in the
[01:54.480 --> 01:58.400]  Republican and Democratic Party till the early and mid-70s the Democrats changed
[01:58.400 --> 02:02.920]  their rules first the Republicans changed them similar it's not quite as
[02:02.920 --> 02:10.160]  openly corrupt but it's the same thing and now they're doing it and I'm sitting
[02:10.160 --> 02:16.640]  there watching it pinching myself and so is everybody else this is a huge wake-up
[02:16.640 --> 02:22.120]  moment because the Republican Party has always been part of the same power
[02:22.120 --> 02:26.560]  leaked the last 60 years or so as the as the Democrats they're all part of the
[02:26.560 --> 02:30.120]  same club they fight over power but they're owned by the same interest and
[02:30.120 --> 02:34.840]  now they want to go ahead and just blow up the Republican Party and let the
[02:34.840 --> 02:39.800]  Democratic Party completely take over and be the authoritarian main system then
[02:39.800 --> 02:43.880]  the Republicans will be a regional party in a few areas of the Midwest and
[02:43.880 --> 02:48.240]  the South and that's their own
[02:49.640 --> 02:54.280]  political strategist statements they've been saying that for years so people say
[02:54.280 --> 02:58.440]  they would blow up the party they would steal the popular vote they would do that
[02:58.440 --> 03:04.680]  they would dare they want to that's their plan it's like asking the Fox would
[03:04.680 --> 03:09.160]  go in the hen house and eat a chicken you mean he'd have the nerve to bite its
[03:09.160 --> 03:14.720]  head off and then drag it out and eat its guts down under a bush man those
[03:14.720 --> 03:22.160]  foxes are just amazing and I saw a bingle tiger on Discovery Channel actually
[03:22.160 --> 03:27.040]  grab a grab a little deer and eat it can you believe it that's what they do and
[03:27.040 --> 03:32.840]  we're entering the in game now the fall of America the takeover in Europe they
[03:32.840 --> 03:37.680]  appoint technocrats now as president of Greece and president of Italy they got
[03:37.680 --> 03:45.480]  wavos they're testing to see what we'll put up with Scotty Neil Hughes one of
[03:45.480 --> 03:52.400]  the Republican counterbalances to all this says that you know riots won't
[03:52.400 --> 03:58.920]  necessarily be a bad thing if this happens but here is what senior GOP
[03:58.920 --> 04:03.160]  official Curly Hewlin had to say let's play the clip saying we choose the
[04:03.160 --> 04:06.720]  nominee not the voters here it is I don't think that's the case once it's you
[04:06.720 --> 04:10.000]  know if it would just be understood we have a problem with the media
[04:10.000 --> 04:14.520]  unfortunately the cable network I don't think this is a problem with the media
[04:14.520 --> 04:17.840]  I've heard from a lot of voters who say if they feel like their votes got stolen
[04:17.840 --> 04:21.320]  that they would be very unhappy and very angry I think you're looking at a
[04:21.320 --> 04:23.880]  different situation I realize these have been the rules but the last time these
[04:23.880 --> 04:28.200]  rules were put in place was 1976 it's been a long time since that yeah they're
[04:28.200 --> 04:33.840]  still there yeah that's a problem the the the media has created the perception
[04:33.840 --> 04:37.160]  that the voters will decide the nomination and that's the content that the
[04:37.160 --> 04:41.120]  conflict here we have been a democratic society what you're telling me is it's
[04:41.120 --> 04:44.120]  not a democratic society and your votes don't necessarily matter because it's a
[04:44.120 --> 04:48.000]  democratic representation correct no that's not what I'm trying to tell you
[04:48.000 --> 04:51.240]  we're gonna go to break we're gonna come back and play the clip in full but
[04:51.240 --> 04:55.640]  but think about that the media is misrepresenting that the delegates got
[04:55.640 --> 05:01.560]  to go with the vote the media's fault now hey kids where you want to go on April
[05:01.560 --> 05:07.400]  2nd whoa democracy springs me too hey there this is Joe Biggs with info wars

[07:02.120 --> 07:07.520]  joins us you worked I guess like 20 plus hours tell us what brain force it I've
[07:07.520 --> 07:11.280]  been working all day I took a couple hours off coaching basketball I get in
[07:11.280 --> 07:15.640]  here at 830 I was kind of run down you know I just didn't feel like I was gonna
[07:15.640 --> 07:19.080]  make it and I really wanted to do a good job on the interview I got my bottle of
[07:19.080 --> 07:22.400]  brain force right there I popped two of them and about 20 minutes later it's
[07:22.400 --> 07:26.960]  like bing everything just kind of clears up got four and a half stars people
[07:26.960 --> 07:30.160]  really love it read about it find out why third-party

[07:41.160 --> 07:45.920]  brain force I went home about 645 this morning took three hours of sleep got up
[07:45.920 --> 07:50.360]  took two more in force and came in you will find a brain force and other game
[07:50.360 --> 08:00.140]  changing products at info wars life calm or call 888 253 313 9 from the front
[08:00.140 --> 08:11.040]  lines of the information war it's Alex Jones well the anti Donald Trump fervor
[08:11.040 --> 08:21.800]  has gone up another level in spinal tap verbiage it's hit 11 and then I guess
[08:21.800 --> 08:26.960]  it's only gonna go higher up from there if you're a new listener and ever saw
[08:26.960 --> 08:32.020]  that classic comedy piece by the same folks that brought you best in show
[08:32.020 --> 08:39.080]  spinal tap it's basically a comedy piece on the 1970s 1980s rock and roll band
[08:39.080 --> 08:43.260]  and they're supposed to making a documentary about them so it's a
[08:43.260 --> 08:49.700]  mockumentary the other people that pioneered that and they are sitting
[08:49.700 --> 08:56.380]  there talking to him and saying why does this amplifier go to 11 why not just
[08:56.380 --> 09:00.900]  have it be 10 but it's louder but he goes no no no it's louder because it goes
[09:00.900 --> 09:05.380]  to 11 do you understand because the numbers higher it's louder so that was
[09:05.380 --> 09:10.420]  why I was being sarcastic it's kind of like infinity and beyond by the way not
[09:10.420 --> 09:16.500]  name-dropping it's just so many times I talk about something and then I realize
[09:16.500 --> 09:21.780]  oh I'm connected to that just to show how effective taking action is they made
[09:21.780 --> 09:26.540]  another mockumentary Harry Shearer and others that make those mockumentaries
[09:26.540 --> 09:32.380]  called teddy bears picnic making fun of yours truly for sneaking into Bohemian
[09:32.380 --> 09:38.580]  Grove so it just shows how we have totally and completely invaded popular
[09:38.580 --> 09:43.500]  culture and then he was in a documentary a real documentary what was it for for
[09:43.500 --> 09:50.220]  HBO where he admitted that it was a mockumentary based on our infiltration
[09:50.220 --> 09:53.940]  and he said I got a hand it to you you're listening to Alex Jones you know over
[09:53.940 --> 09:57.100]  the shortwave at night and you're sitting there listening to it with your
[09:57.100 --> 10:03.340]  kid it's scary he almost had me for a minute oh I almost had the voice of Mr.
[10:03.340 --> 10:08.820]  Burns on the Simpsons for a minute brother we're going to go into total
[10:08.820 --> 10:13.180]  tyranny if you don't wake up to it I know 15 years ago when you made that film
[10:13.180 --> 10:17.500]  it was a joke to say the NSA was spying on us so that there were cancer viruses
[10:17.500 --> 10:23.980]  and the vaccines it's all admitted do you think I want this stuff to be true I
[10:23.980 --> 10:31.540]  don't want this to be true I mean I remember it's like 10 years ago it was
[10:31.540 --> 10:37.020]  in the Associated Press that in a Minnesota city I forget which one that
[10:37.020 --> 10:42.220]  that they put in special light bulbs the new high-tech light bulbs and that they
[10:42.220 --> 10:46.820]  were communicating with the computers with data down power lines through the
[10:46.820 --> 10:52.660]  light bulbs to the computers and that it had the added backdrop of calming the
[10:52.660 --> 10:57.980]  police because they could run a program on it that was shown to quote calm the
[10:57.980 --> 11:04.980]  police what because you can flicker rate and actually manipulate people that's
[11:04.980 --> 11:09.500]  that's that's multi-hundred-year-old technology you know the
[11:09.500 --> 11:15.060]  psychologist hypnotizing you with a strobe light or with a swinging coin
[11:15.060 --> 11:19.780]  that's all manipulation of light in the eyes they're thousands of times more
[11:19.780 --> 11:23.900]  sophisticated now and then just the last few months I saw articles everywhere
[11:23.900 --> 11:28.300]  where they rolled it out hey your light bulbs are gonna calm you and make you
[11:28.300 --> 11:35.260]  happy hey they're gonna communicate with your computers your smart home but
[11:35.260 --> 11:39.300]  nevertheless they have mainstream news articles making fun of us saying we're
[11:39.300 --> 11:45.300]  crazy and think that light bulbs are mind-controlling us or Alex says that the
[11:45.300 --> 11:51.660]  government's making frogs gay know what I said was is the runoff of what we're
[11:51.660 --> 11:58.060]  eating and what we're drinking the glyphosates the bisphenol a the estrogen
[11:58.060 --> 12:02.980]  mimicers the birth control is so strong that in most reservoirs and runoff
[12:02.980 --> 12:07.860]  creeks and rivers and streams the numbers vary but it's between 30 and 80
[12:07.860 --> 12:11.700]  percent depending on where you are in the Western world of the fish and the
[12:11.700 --> 12:16.580]  amphibians are asexual bisexual or sexually sterile or mutated they're
[12:16.580 --> 12:21.500]  completely jacked their answer is to say Alex Jones thinks the government wants
[12:21.500 --> 12:27.300]  to make frogs gay the good news is people aren't listening to this bull
[12:27.300 --> 12:32.540]  anymore and it hit me this morning I had some old quotes smart washers and dryers
[12:32.540 --> 12:36.700]  because you know even though I quote know a lot of what's going on and about
[12:36.700 --> 12:40.940]  the trends that they're setting I'm not a techie when it comes to programming
[12:40.940 --> 12:45.460]  itself but when it comes to reading the big foundation announcements and reading
[12:45.460 --> 12:50.140]  stuff 15 16 years ago at big international conventions on the future of
[12:50.140 --> 12:54.180]  tech what they were saying they would do so I know what it's delivering I know
[12:54.180 --> 13:01.900]  how it works and even though I know all this five six years ago I need some
[13:01.900 --> 13:06.460]  quote new washers and dryers I have these old analog ones I'd had forever they
[13:06.460 --> 13:13.780]  were getting bad so buy some new flashy flashy you know plastic red ones that are
[13:13.780 --> 13:21.300]  quote smart didn't really pay attention binging bonging breaking screwing up the
[13:21.300 --> 13:27.620]  chipboard burned out on one expensive pieces of junk don't work right so I
[13:27.620 --> 13:33.700]  finally go around a few weeks ago to different shops I try to shop at a mom
[13:33.700 --> 13:37.100]  and pop and I go look at the big showrooms the big establishments I
[13:37.100 --> 13:44.420]  finally find a place where they've got a made America their analog I go read the
[13:44.420 --> 13:51.380]  reviews they're the hottest thing out there they've got great reviews and I'm
[13:51.380 --> 13:54.620]  not plugging a sponsor yet I'm actually trying to get them as a sponsor and I go
[13:54.620 --> 13:58.820]  and I buy two of them and it's totally analog and is retro and it has much
[13:58.820 --> 14:02.220]  better ratings works better and it's fantastic and I was talking to the guy
[14:02.220 --> 14:06.140]  and I went and looked looked it up and sure enough there's giant movements
[14:06.140 --> 14:10.860]  we already knew this but I just dug into it deeper of going analog going old
[14:10.860 --> 14:16.300]  fashioned so I went ahead had one of these smart stoves couldn't stand I
[14:16.300 --> 14:19.860]  went ahead and I'm getting rid of that I'm going out and getting a made in
[14:19.860 --> 14:26.220]  America awesome it's not even analog it doesn't even have any buttons on it and
[14:26.220 --> 14:32.220]  then I'm going to get an old-fashioned egg timer and again I wouldn't look that
[14:32.220 --> 14:35.300]  up and it's a giant trend because I noticed suddenly there's all this
[14:35.300 --> 14:40.380]  analog stuff everywhere people are subconsciously rebelling against the
[14:40.380 --> 14:46.020]  tyranny systems that they call smart they just give you a new car and it's all
[14:46.020 --> 14:50.260]  these thousands of dollars of added cost now even on a moderately priced new car
[14:50.260 --> 14:58.020]  $20,000 and it's got all this quote you know smart driving systems and reactive
[14:58.020 --> 15:01.380]  driving it's the beginning of the takeover of the quote smart cars they'll
[15:01.380 --> 15:07.260]  run our lives but if we just don't buy them and just don't accept them and call
[15:07.260 --> 15:12.060]  for what we want in the market to be retro but with new technology integrated
[15:12.060 --> 15:16.900]  in we will govern the future they want to just have this stuff ubiquitously all
[15:16.900 --> 15:22.420]  come into place be there we just kind of wake up in a technocracy but it's not
[15:22.420 --> 15:27.020]  happening because then I started doing hours of research the last few days I
[15:27.020 --> 15:31.340]  got obsessed with it and I need to do a special report on it but I kind of hit
[15:31.340 --> 15:34.660]  this problem point where I have too much data and then I'm trying to think where
[15:34.660 --> 15:39.340]  do I start and it turns out it's in all these trade publications that it's a
[15:39.340 --> 15:45.860]  giant trend completely away from everything smart and why is it that you
[15:45.860 --> 15:52.180]  move into a new house not even a new new house but you know a house they put new
[15:52.180 --> 15:57.900]  quote thermostats in and it's oh it's controlled by your iPhone or oh your new
[15:57.900 --> 16:01.940]  cable systems controlled by it and it's a total piece of junk that hackers are
[16:01.940 --> 16:07.980]  able to get into it doesn't work half the time it's super hard to use the
[16:07.980 --> 16:12.620]  interfaces are crud and people sure enough are going back again to basic
[16:12.620 --> 16:18.860]  cable boxes or to basic systems people are sick of it and I am too but I just
[16:18.860 --> 16:22.900]  realized how people get caught in these traps because even I just kind of
[16:22.900 --> 16:29.060]  accepted oh yeah honey you want some new washers and dryers sure and then you got
[16:29.060 --> 16:33.980]  smart stuff in your house and it's not smart at all it's stupid and it doesn't
[16:33.980 --> 16:39.500]  work and it's a junk and I'm sick of it there's the headline it's not just smart
[16:39.500 --> 16:43.380]  TVs your home is full of gadgets that spy on you how internet gadgets are
[16:43.380 --> 16:47.940]  collecting your personal data through their high tech devices that's 2015
[16:47.940 --> 16:51.900]  London Telegraph New York Times you name it or you could just go to m4wars.com
[16:51.900 --> 16:59.740]  and read the exact same article from 2005 but boy when we first told you that
[16:59.740 --> 17:02.740]  there were cameras and microphones hidden in your new TVs and cable boxes
[17:02.740 --> 17:09.980]  people didn't want to hear it and again I'm not bragging about us here I'm
[17:09.980 --> 17:14.820]  saying we're not conspiracy theorist we know what we're talking about and I'm
[17:14.820 --> 17:18.900]  again not up on some high horse telling you I'm great and almighty and I make
[17:18.900 --> 17:22.140]  all the right decisions I turn around every day and just go I've had a
[17:22.140 --> 17:27.100]  terrible decision there but you know what I'm gonna change it next time I buy

[17:32.500 --> 17:37.140]  choice that's why the globalist under political correctness want to get rid of
[17:37.140 --> 17:42.860]  real choice and limit language now I've digressed but that's some really good
[17:42.860 --> 17:46.980]  news there folks that nothing can stop a free market that's why they want to
[17:46.980 --> 17:52.620]  manage crony capitalist market and we've got a counter it organic foods an

[18:22.100 --> 18:27.140]  to you but it the new development is is that they're admittedly doing it it's
[18:27.140 --> 18:31.980]  crazy and we've got so much other over the top news it's just amazing
[18:31.980 --> 18:34.780]  Trump's getting into it with the Russians a little bit we're gonna break

[18:48.300 --> 18:52.300]  briefly before I forget because I always forget there's a lot of things added to
[18:52.300 --> 18:56.460]  the store that I approve of because I've seen the specs on them we buy a bunch
[18:56.460 --> 18:59.700]  get a good price that's how we funded operation is just selling high quality
[18:59.700 --> 19:04.020]  products we're rewriting the whole system for radio and TV we're being
[19:04.020 --> 19:07.860]  copied a lot now by folks in direct sales that's fine I won't talk radio and
[19:07.860 --> 19:11.020]  independent media to survive the establishment media is too arrogant dumb
[19:11.020 --> 19:14.180]  to even know how to do this we're gonna skip this network break this is so
[19:14.180 --> 19:24.140]  important we carry the very best toothbrush system out there that I am
[19:24.140 --> 19:32.020]  just so amazingly proud of and it's an antimicrobial flossing bristle toothbrush
[19:32.020 --> 19:37.780]  that is unlike anything we've ever seen now I just started using these even though
[19:37.780 --> 19:42.820]  I proved of them a year ago about two weeks ago when Tim Frosier who's in
[19:42.820 --> 19:47.100]  charge of a lot of our purchasing and decisions said man that these are the
[19:47.100 --> 19:51.140]  best-selling thing ever and you've never even promoted them so I thought oh
[19:51.140 --> 19:54.940]  yeah prove that like a year ago wanted to try it out but had rave reviews it's
[19:54.940 --> 20:01.060]  got colloidal silver embedded in it I said let me take one home incredible the

[21:16.060 --> 21:20.540]  is the top nationwide selling brand that you get at Whole Foods and other
[21:20.540 --> 21:25.780]  places we just private label it and instead of being 24.95 there's a big
[21:25.780 --> 21:28.460]  outbreak or something they jack it up between that 95 which is fine that's
[21:28.460 --> 21:34.780]  what they do we sell it for $19.95 that is the lowest price for the silver alone
[21:34.780 --> 21:41.500]  now a free colloidal silver high-tech I mean it's a high-quality toothbrush so

[21:50.180 --> 21:55.360]  we're talking 25 billion in each pill and their smaller pills would be 50
[21:55.360 --> 22:00.700]  billion organisms in each larger pill because we've not compromised so long to
[22:00.700 --> 22:05.780]  you know to develop what is it industry game changer and I was talking to Buckley
[22:05.780 --> 22:10.340]  who who gets one from his doctor that's super high quality that's 130 bucks in
[22:10.340 --> 22:16.220]  his prescription and it doesn't have to be prescription but but it's just done
[22:16.220 --> 22:19.900]  that way because folks will pay more and I'm sure it's a great one but we've
[22:19.900 --> 22:23.140]  looked the strains ours is better and I was talking to the industry people that
[22:23.140 --> 22:27.700]  are producing this and they said listen the low number is 80 on this other
[22:27.700 --> 22:32.180]  folks are selling it this similar something similar for 150 or more and
[22:32.180 --> 22:39.060]  Buckley's like absolutely mines 130 and I said we're doing it for 40 it's just
[22:39.060 --> 22:43.620]  how I operate and I get it some people we put a big price tag on something we'll
[22:43.620 --> 22:47.460]  think it's better and buy it I will not involve myself in that and look it's not
[22:47.460 --> 22:52.060]  bad to mark something up four or five times if you want to I'm just not gonna
[22:52.060 --> 22:56.580]  do it I want to have the best products at the lowest prices that are really
[22:56.580 --> 23:01.500]  excellent show that you understand that we're all in this together and that you

[23:17.900 --> 23:25.140]  x2 I want you to experience it I want you to see what happens by the way that
[23:25.140 --> 23:30.260]  I'm gonna get back to the news I'm not mad at anybody but it's happened to a
[23:30.260 --> 23:36.180]  couple of my friends and my mother and everybody else I've seen emails about it
[23:36.180 --> 23:42.100]  once I talked about it the office has all heard about it the basic liver cleanse
[23:42.100 --> 23:47.740]  is easy it's liver shield in water four or five times a day eight ounces with
[23:47.740 --> 23:52.100]  apple cider vinegar we don't sell that you can get at the store you want the
[23:52.100 --> 23:56.900]  live probiotic type with four to six depending how big you are oxy powder
[23:56.900 --> 24:03.700]  pills at bedtime for six days on the sixth day you drink seven ounces of
[24:03.700 --> 24:07.580]  virgin olive oil before you go to bed about an hour before and you take two
[24:07.580 --> 24:11.700]  to three caplets of pure medical grade epsom salts you just get at the drug
[24:11.700 --> 24:16.140]  store you put it in the little caplets you lay on your right side on your
[24:16.140 --> 24:19.340]  gallbladder and liver for at least an hour before you go to sleep you wake up
[24:19.340 --> 24:22.700]  in the morning and almost everyone the next morning it's it's like the movie
[24:22.700 --> 24:26.460]  alien okay I mean it's it's unbelievable what is in there no wonder
[24:26.460 --> 24:32.060]  gallbladders are exploding all the time full all these stones that's what feeds
[24:32.060 --> 24:36.020]  out of the liver right into there it's amazing and my mom wants to do it I
[24:36.020 --> 24:39.860]  wasn't doing it next Monday she's like this is 10 pages long it's the diet and
[24:39.860 --> 24:44.140]  special bone soups and how to really supercharge it I can never do that I'm
[24:44.140 --> 24:48.660]  I can barely do the cleanse okay it'll be my second cleanse I did one had a huge
[24:48.660 --> 24:54.420]  effect started the second one got busy with news and just blew it off okay so
[24:54.420 --> 24:58.220]  we're changing it where there's the basic one and then the advanced because
[24:58.220 --> 25:03.860]  it's totally discouraging people from the liver shield cleanse because it's
[25:03.860 --> 25:08.140]  10 pages long and look if you're a health guru like group it is the best
[25:08.140 --> 25:11.420]  liver cleanse out there okay everybody freaks out on the other big health
[25:11.420 --> 25:15.620]  sites this is the best liver cleanse just the basic one and the big fancy one
[25:15.620 --> 25:18.740]  is just over the top liver and gallbladder cleanse but I mean I don't
[25:18.740 --> 25:24.540]  have time to spend 10 hours a day doing that this way it's very very easy liver
[25:24.540 --> 25:28.740]  shield is available at info wars life comm with the oxy powder and more we
[25:28.740 --> 25:31.340]  finally got it back in a few weeks ago take advantage of it I hope to do the
[25:31.340 --> 25:33.940]  cleanse with us next week now I don't normally even plug in the first hour
[25:33.940 --> 25:36.500]  sorry I've been plugging for five minutes I'm gonna shut up now but I'm just
[25:36.500 --> 25:42.940]  very excited about all of this and oxy powder is the product by itself that's
[25:42.940 --> 25:46.660]  the most dramatic I don't want to go into the tales but it's a higher level of
[25:46.660 --> 25:50.140]  oxygen it breaks down in the upper and lower intestine and it dissolves
[25:50.140 --> 25:53.780]  everything and John Wayne had 40 something pounds reportedly at his
[25:53.780 --> 25:58.180]  autopsy of undigested beef at him so you can imagine folks what the average
[25:58.180 --> 26:02.500]  person Rob do lost 12 pounds in one week and he wasn't even fat it was purely
[26:02.500 --> 26:06.540]  what was in it he plays basketball coaches basketball at a college
[26:06.540 --> 26:12.940]  scholarship and basketball I mean he's an athlete and he had a little stomach
[26:12.940 --> 26:19.500]  gone gone because it was just the guts full you know what same thing that
[26:19.500 --> 26:23.500]  Obama's full of and Hillary's full of and it's in there rotting ladies and
[26:23.500 --> 26:28.620]  gentlemen and just the oxy powder alone will absolutely blow you away
[26:28.620 --> 26:32.940]  literally and some people that are backed up go three four days I'm going to
[26:32.940 --> 26:36.620]  tell why those it's our bodies it's health it's the gut it's important some
[26:36.620 --> 26:39.380]  people go three four days they're like this isn't working and they're like oh

[26:47.100 --> 26:50.700]  there I apologize I'm just so excited about this because it's such a life
[26:50.700 --> 26:54.580]  changing situation what we're doing in informerslife.com and I praise God
[26:54.580 --> 26:59.900]  literally for all the blessings for all the best breaks for discovering the

[27:08.460 --> 27:11.940]  really helping info wars go to the next level so the Lord does work in
[27:11.940 --> 27:16.340]  mysterious ways we had people persecute our sponsors and folks that were
[27:16.340 --> 27:20.660]  nutraceuticals we lost sponsors the enemy came against us about five years
[27:20.660 --> 27:25.020]  ago we had infiltration operations I had to have a whole game change I just
[27:25.020 --> 27:30.700]  envisioned it I did it everything worked in spades it was amazing just total
[27:30.700 --> 27:39.260]  providence how every enemy attack just turned into pure doors opening just
[27:39.260 --> 27:42.220]  thank God I haven't been put anything like Joe but God has just been so good to

[33:01.860 --> 33:08.060]  of the information war it's Alex Jones
[33:08.060 --> 33:28.260]  we are back live ladies and gentlemen let's get into the move to steal the
[33:28.260 --> 33:31.180]  nomination from Donald Trump I mean normally if somebody has a clear
[33:31.180 --> 33:37.580]  majority then the other delegates basically get behind them by now the
[33:37.580 --> 33:40.940]  Republican candidates would be dropping out Republican Party would be saying
[33:40.940 --> 33:45.300]  clearly Trump is the winner hands down but that's not happening sure they have
[33:45.300 --> 33:48.780]  the governor of Florida coming out and giving a tacit endorsement of Trump
[33:48.780 --> 33:52.620]  saying now's the time to get behind him it's a it's a tepid endorsement but it's
[33:52.620 --> 33:58.260]  there and and we're seeing people like Newt Gingrich come out and say look he's
[33:58.260 --> 34:02.340]  the guy you're gonna destroy the party but you've got people like Mitch McConnell
[34:02.340 --> 34:07.820]  saying we'll rather just Hillary get in than Donald Trump really Hillary is
[34:07.820 --> 34:11.700]  better than Donald Trump well it shows the power structure wants to be in power
[34:11.700 --> 34:15.140]  and they don't want Donald Trump pointing out that we've been sold out to
[34:15.140 --> 34:19.620]  globalism and so I'm gonna play this clip senior GOP official Curly
[34:19.620 --> 34:24.420]  Hewland says we choose the nominee not the voters and this is the biggest
[34:24.420 --> 34:29.180]  example of spin I've seen in a while where he's like it's the media because he
[34:29.180 --> 34:33.580]  knows people don't like the media so it's the media misrepresenting that the
[34:33.580 --> 34:37.820]  popular vote is what does this it's always the delegates and they can vote
[34:37.820 --> 34:42.940]  for who they want the delegate is sent by the people at the precinct because they
[34:42.940 --> 34:50.420]  pledge to honor the vote in 74 was it 72 the Democrats changed theirs in 76 the
[34:50.420 --> 34:55.260]  Republicans changed theirs to basically allow party officials who are quote
[34:55.260 --> 35:00.300]  super delegates who organize the delegates to then tell them oh it's okay
[35:00.300 --> 35:05.700]  if you change your vote it's like kid come here the playground it's okay if you
[35:05.700 --> 35:11.420]  use this cocaine don't don't matter what your teacher says come on over it's like
[35:11.420 --> 35:14.660]  it's alright for you to rob a liquor store go in there and point the gun at
[35:14.660 --> 35:25.300]  them and say give me the money you did that's what they are doing and so they
[35:25.300 --> 35:29.660]  just spin it in plain view it's like oh big mega banks are allowed to own the
[35:29.660 --> 35:34.540]  fellow reserve oh the NSA is allowed to spy on you without warrants now oh we
[35:34.540 --> 35:38.700]  are gonna give you forced inoculations even if you don't like it oh oh your
[35:38.700 --> 35:43.980]  refrigerator is actually has a microphone and the TV's watching and listening and
[35:43.980 --> 35:48.660]  Samsung when you turn the TV on when you first turn on Samsung TV's for two
[35:48.660 --> 35:54.700]  years it tells you in a 10-plus page letter we've posted it that they can
[35:54.700 --> 35:58.420]  sell the audio and video of what you do in your house to anyone they wish
[35:58.420 --> 36:01.380]  including third parties and I told everybody I said it's all the major
[36:01.380 --> 36:05.420]  smart TVs and everybody went and looked and it was true that was just a couple
[36:05.420 --> 36:10.300]  years ago drudging to our articles that was right out of the brochure and off
[36:10.300 --> 36:16.220]  Samsung's own website promo-ing it and they had national news say I was a liar
[36:16.220 --> 36:21.180]  member four years ago they said there are no drones watching rural areas in
[36:21.180 --> 36:27.640]  America we were linked in articles to mainstream local papers and they came
[36:27.640 --> 36:30.660]  out and said we were a liar and drudge report dot com Matt Drudge had gone
[36:30.660 --> 36:42.700]  insane he was linking to Kurt Nemo and Alex Jones and info wars he was insane and
[36:42.700 --> 36:46.100]  now it's all over the news that they got Pentagon drones everywhere watch the
[36:46.100 --> 36:55.860]  American people but it was in the news then and that's just in the announced
[36:55.860 --> 37:03.140]  times they do it so we've gone from them saying oh we would never did not not
[37:03.140 --> 37:09.940]  honor the popular vote at the delegate level to of course we don't follow what
[37:09.940 --> 37:14.780]  next they'll say there was never even voting conspiracy theorists say you use
[37:14.780 --> 37:20.020]  to vote we appoint the parties appoint super delegates and they'll be your
[37:20.020 --> 37:26.740]  local lords they'll wear little gold crowns mommy is it true that babies used
[37:26.740 --> 37:31.340]  to come out of their mommies and they weren't grown in tanks no that's a
[37:31.340 --> 37:36.780]  conspiracy theory it won't even be because more than half the person's
[37:36.780 --> 37:41.580]  country is the Sarian now because they're quicker it makes more money they
[37:41.580 --> 37:46.300]  will start saying mark my words in the generation that that babies never came
[37:46.300 --> 37:50.660]  out of their mommies next they'll say there was never milk either they'll
[37:50.660 --> 37:55.180]  say it's a conspiracy theory that mommies ever gave milk and by the way
[37:55.180 --> 38:03.820]  I'm not being satirical here is it true that humans used to mate and then have
[38:03.820 --> 38:09.100]  inception no no no it was always at the local medical center the eugenics center
[38:09.100 --> 38:14.940]  where the embryos were created the state made humans that's basically where
[38:14.940 --> 38:20.260]  these people are going Obamacare is free there are no death panels see how they
[38:20.260 --> 38:23.620]  hide it in plain view it came out two and a half years ago that they have
[38:23.620 --> 38:28.740]  death list of do not treat list for political reasons you name it of the
[38:28.740 --> 38:32.580]  military just like they have in the UK with that national health service and
[38:32.580 --> 38:37.940]  now they admit the VA's the model of Obamacare where they decide for political
[38:37.940 --> 38:42.220]  reasons not just that you smoke cigarettes not just this no no now the
[38:42.220 --> 38:48.380]  computer by IBM that ran the Nazi computers every time I say that again
[38:48.380 --> 38:52.140]  email saying I'm making it up just type an IBM in the Holocaust it's a fact it's
[38:52.140 --> 38:59.380]  so well known it's ridiculous I'm not gonna digress Thomas Watson founded it
[38:59.380 --> 39:04.940]  he got the highest award of any Nazi in history they had to make a special award
[39:04.940 --> 39:12.180]  above the ones Hitler got for him they ran Nazi Germany on IBM computers
[39:12.180 --> 39:20.700]  on hollereth machines it's a fact and you know it's true to quote Sammy Hagar I
[39:20.700 --> 39:25.660]  don't want to come in next segment with that it's not my point of view it's a
[39:25.660 --> 39:35.900]  fact they had IBM machines in the 30s deciding which poor white and black
[39:35.900 --> 39:41.340]  people and Puerto Ricans in New York to grab grab put in white trucks and take
[39:41.340 --> 39:49.180]  to be sterilized that's all public America finance Hitler gave him
[39:49.180 --> 39:53.180]  everything shut up the Kaiser Velum Institute with the British crown the
[39:53.180 --> 39:59.180]  king of England was a Nazi people say oh there he goes German Germans run no no
[39:59.180 --> 40:06.340]  no no Nazi Germany was an egg laid by the big dragon the Anglo-American
[40:06.340 --> 40:10.740]  establishment and then it used its baby rampaging to get everybody under its
[40:10.740 --> 40:16.700]  wings no they're so sophisticated they're hard to beat aren't they they're
[40:16.700 --> 40:24.700]  really hard to beat let's let's go to the senior Republican in the RNC
[40:24.700 --> 40:35.700]  curly where's Moe and Larry here he is arrogantly in your face telling you
[40:35.700 --> 40:41.820]  your vote never existed it never counted let's play it I don't think that's the
[40:41.820 --> 40:45.300]  case once it's it you know if it would just be understood we have a problem
[40:45.300 --> 40:50.380]  with the media unfortunately the cable network I don't think this is a problem
[40:50.380 --> 40:53.340]  with the media I've heard from a lot of voters who say if they feel like their
[40:53.340 --> 40:57.340]  votes got stolen that they would be very unhappy and very angry I think you're
[40:57.340 --> 40:59.740]  looking at a different situation I realize these have been the rules but the
[40:59.740 --> 41:02.940]  last time these rules were put in place was 1976 it's been a long time since
[41:02.940 --> 41:09.060]  that and they're still there yeah that's the problem the the the media has
[41:09.060 --> 41:12.500]  created the perception that the voters will decide the nomination and that's
[41:12.500 --> 41:16.780]  the content that's the conflict here we live in a democratic society what you're
[41:16.780 --> 41:19.540]  telling me is it's not a democratic society and your votes don't necessarily
[41:19.540 --> 41:23.580]  matter because it's a democratic representation correct no that's not
[41:23.580 --> 41:26.180]  what I'm trying to tell you what I'm trying to say is that there's a we're
[41:26.180 --> 41:29.780]  just one of the political parties there's many political parties but political
[41:29.780 --> 41:34.020]  parties choose their nominee not the general public contrary to popular
[41:34.020 --> 41:38.420]  beliefs and why they're holding the primaries that's a very good question
[41:38.420 --> 41:47.180]  look Gary did you hear that let's play the last ten seconds again please cue
[41:47.180 --> 41:54.020]  that up if you can why are we even having primaries that's good why are we
[41:54.020 --> 42:00.580]  even voting we are a limited democracy and that you can't have the big more
[42:00.580 --> 42:04.620]  popular states outvote other states and take their rights that's why you have
[42:04.620 --> 42:08.620]  two senators per state and then a portion for your population you have the
[42:08.620 --> 42:15.260]  number of representatives of the house let's go and go back to the club of the
[42:15.260 --> 42:18.780]  political parties there's many political parties the political parties choose
[42:18.780 --> 42:23.660]  their nominee not the general public contrary to popular beliefs and why
[42:23.660 --> 42:31.740]  holding the primaries that's a very good question can you queue up just for
[42:31.740 --> 42:35.260]  TV viewers I just want to start playing it all the time where Koto pulls back
[42:35.260 --> 42:41.020]  the curtain or we ought to schmaltz that up and get McBrain to get the HD
[42:41.020 --> 42:46.940]  original and maybe in full wars eyes it you know where we pull back the curtain
[42:46.940 --> 42:52.020]  and you know we see what's really going on here because they're just hiding in
[42:52.020 --> 42:57.180]  plain view okay foreign banks own and run the country okay the political parties
[42:57.180 --> 43:05.900]  are now interpreting their rules outside of law to just say your vote
[43:05.900 --> 43:08.260]  doesn't kill
[43:11.180 --> 43:20.700]  isn't that interesting and curly is the leader of the GOP RNC in North Dakota
[43:20.700 --> 43:26.420]  he's the national committee chairman and he's like yeah why do we even vote good
[43:26.420 --> 43:32.540]  good question talk about the curtain getting pulled back ladies and gentlemen
[43:32.540 --> 43:37.460]  let's go to another story it's up on drudgereport.com
[43:38.220 --> 43:46.500]  Roger Stone how the GOP elite plan to steal the election from Trump you need
[43:46.500 --> 43:52.740]  to read it it gets into the secret meeting meanwhile we have world order at
[43:52.740 --> 43:56.580]  risk world leaders are coming out the Economist magazine run by the Rothschild
[43:56.580 --> 44:02.340]  is coming out infowars.com Rothschild intel unit equates Donald Trump to Jihad
[44:02.340 --> 44:07.620]  terror yeah the the Economist calls for open borders the globalist call for
[44:07.620 --> 44:10.860]  open borders they bring in all these foreigners they attack us and then the
[44:10.860 --> 44:16.460]  guy trying to stop it they blame you see it's the attempt to murder logic people
[44:16.460 --> 44:19.660]  say none of this makes sense everything they say is the opposite of reality
[44:19.660 --> 44:24.500]  they're trying to scramble people's brains it's meant to not make sense on
[44:24.500 --> 44:29.980]  purpose but just be a unified wall of propaganda where we all then under
[44:29.980 --> 44:33.340]  cognitive dissonance and gaslighting look up those terms we guys print the
[44:33.340 --> 44:41.820]  definition of gaslighting thank you feel like we're the cooks feel like we're
[44:41.820 --> 44:45.260]  the bad guys speaking of the jihadis that I'm getting back to the Trump
[44:45.260 --> 44:53.460]  news look at this stack Nigeria mosque bomb Boko Haram suicide attack that's
[44:53.460 --> 45:02.940]  that's al-Qaeda suicide attack kills 22 worshippers hope Francis asked nations
[45:02.940 --> 45:07.620]  to open their hearts and their doors to migrants and this morning I was reading
[45:07.620 --> 45:10.380]  this article and I thought you know I'm gonna pull up two weeks ago where he said
[45:10.380 --> 45:14.380]  Italy should control its borders and with and that Italy doesn't need hundreds
[45:14.380 --> 45:18.660]  of thousands of more a month of North Africans and Muslims because the
[45:18.660 --> 45:21.820]  cultures aren't compatible he actually gave a speech on that but only for
[45:21.820 --> 45:28.260]  Italy the outer wall of his 200-foot walls at Vatican City and then before I
[45:28.260 --> 45:34.860]  even searched it I saw another article from Breitbart Albania calls in
[45:34.860 --> 45:40.260]  Italian military as migrants scramble to open new Balkans route they're just
[45:40.260 --> 45:44.540]  and they admit jihadis they've got weapons they're just pouring across into
[45:44.540 --> 45:50.100]  Albania Macedonia and Albania is Muslim and they don't want these people
[45:50.100 --> 45:59.940]  coming there I mean this is crazy just five illegal immigrants arrested by UK
[45:59.940 --> 46:05.420]  border police and it shows an image of a big fat border cop and this came out
[46:05.420 --> 46:09.540]  under Tony Blair in 97 and 98 it came out of years later that they had ordered
[46:09.540 --> 46:13.580]  the cops to stand down and let the illegals jump on the backs of trains and
[46:13.580 --> 46:18.660]  come under the tunnel in the English Channel the channel that's just called
[46:18.660 --> 46:25.540]  over there by the feet of construction I've been in it and yeah you get to either
[46:25.540 --> 46:28.700]  side they've had to close it though because they let the illegals in on the
[46:28.700 --> 46:32.220]  French side but they'll just start robbing and stealing and beating
[46:32.220 --> 46:35.620]  people and so finally they've got a restore order because they even start
[46:35.620 --> 46:40.140]  trying to go after the cops we've shown those videos here they don't even know
[46:40.140 --> 46:43.620]  how to behave themselves and just get on the backs of the trains they're hijacking
[46:43.620 --> 46:47.740]  trucks cars I mean imagine you're there with your family and just a thousand
[46:47.740 --> 46:53.020]  people I just drag you out steal your car beat you mainstream French news a
[46:53.020 --> 46:58.020]  month ago quote declared an emergency on their highways just robbing stealing
[46:58.020 --> 47:04.940]  killing couple million people just stumbling around robbing 80 plus percent
[47:04.940 --> 47:09.580]  military-age men why would Halon and Merkel do this they're bringing Europe
[47:09.580 --> 47:14.540]  down folks this is a takeover they want them to collapse like Greece collapse
[47:14.540 --> 47:18.420]  like Brazil collapse like Mexico because once it collapses you're going to be
[47:18.420 --> 47:22.580]  poor and you'll be so busy trying to get food you're not going to be up to the
[47:22.580 --> 47:27.900]  anymore they're ending prosperity ladies and gentlemen and all these cops and
[47:27.900 --> 47:32.860]  Border Patrol that follow these illegal orders they're going to get demoted
[47:32.860 --> 47:36.140]  they're going to see their pensions taken as well the vanishing pension that
[47:36.140 --> 47:43.220]  disappears the moment you go to retrieving quote George Carlin and it
[47:43.220 --> 47:48.940]  just goes on and on I have stacks of news on this front
[47:48.940 --> 47:55.420]  meanwhile in military news general says army at high risk in war against China
[47:55.420 --> 48:00.820]  and Russia AP the Army's top general says military forces on the ground facing
[48:00.820 --> 48:04.940]  high level of risk in the United States gets into large-scale conflict and the
[48:04.940 --> 48:09.980]  powers such as Russia or China and general Mark Miley goes on in his
[48:09.980 --> 48:14.860]  report to say that we are at one of the highest levels of potential war with
[48:14.860 --> 48:23.100]  China and Russia ever ever ever but don't worry Obama has a peace prize that's
[48:23.100 --> 48:27.380]  why he's pushing all these Soros operations poking China poking Russia
[48:27.380 --> 48:34.180]  now China is doing some poking of its own Russia is not and since I mentioned
[48:34.180 --> 48:38.180]  that let's go to the short campaign and Trump has a staff of folks that I know
[48:38.180 --> 48:42.580]  for a fact inside baseball put out tons of these reports tons these little 15
[48:42.580 --> 48:45.500]  second what do they call these 15-second things they've had for a few years on the
[48:45.500 --> 48:52.180]  net that are so popular it's like a 15-second rant that it it you're on
[48:52.180 --> 48:57.900]  air right I am now okay good so there's video memes and there's vines but what's
[48:57.900 --> 49:02.500]  a little 15-second ones they have a name I guess it's been yet then yet or
[49:02.500 --> 49:05.340]  something the point is these are real popular Trump does a whole bunch of them
[49:05.340 --> 49:09.980]  every day his staff did one that's copied other people it's an internet meme
[49:09.980 --> 49:14.940]  showing Obama being a wimp on a bicycle and then showing Putin hunting or being
[49:14.940 --> 49:19.740]  tough you know being John Wayne style so now the Russians have come out and said
[49:19.740 --> 49:23.460]  in mainstream Russian news stop insulting us stop saying we're dangerous you
[49:23.460 --> 49:27.180]  know showing this that's not what Trump's doing and Trump didn't even do this
[49:27.180 --> 49:30.660]  Trump says leave Russia alone they're not attacking anybody and he would want
[49:30.660 --> 49:36.140]  to work with Putin and that he supports Putin taking on ISIS but his staff puts
[49:36.140 --> 49:40.060]  out a little 15-second deal make it fun of Hillary it's a compliment to Putin
[49:40.060 --> 49:54.100]  that he's tough and she's a wimp so let's go to the 15-second Trump video
[50:00.500 --> 50:04.820]  we don't need to be a punchline Trump make America great again and so it's
[50:04.820 --> 50:08.740]  just saying as far in governments there's terrorists whatever that's what
[50:08.740 --> 50:12.900]  it's saying and the Russian news Kremlin says Trump video demonizes Russia
[50:12.900 --> 50:20.620]  Sky News so I hope that I hope Russia knows what they're doing I think they
[50:20.620 --> 50:25.940]  do you know it see here's the deal if Trump came out and bash Russia it'd be
[50:25.940 --> 50:28.940]  popular with some Americans and look strong but he won't do that because
[50:28.940 --> 50:35.140]  Russia's done nothing to us that's another good thing that Trump does but
[50:35.140 --> 50:37.940]  maybe he had put on a get-together and act like they hate each other or
[50:37.940 --> 50:41.180]  something so Trump can get elected but see I don't play dirty tricks like that
[50:41.180 --> 50:45.420]  and Trump isn't either he's taking the high road he isn't gonna do it so the
[50:45.420 --> 50:49.620]  Russians might be helping Trump in a way they don't even know all right we're
[50:49.620 --> 50:53.300]  going to be right back on the other side with more of the open announcement that

[54:19.260 --> 54:32.700]  it's not my opinion folks it's a fact and you know it's true there's a big evil
[54:32.700 --> 54:40.580]  world government that laid the egg of communism in 1917 publicly fallen record
[54:40.580 --> 54:47.460]  and they laid the egg of Nazism they laid the egg of globalism the CIA is on
[54:47.460 --> 54:53.900]  record put mouse the tongue in power in 49 they put Fidel Castro in power and he
[54:53.900 --> 55:01.980]  double crossed them and they are the ones pushing the abortion they're the
[55:01.980 --> 55:07.580]  ones pushing all the manipulation of our genetic genome the crimes of the
[55:07.580 --> 55:16.380]  globalists are legion upon legion upon legion and there's only one way to stop
[55:16.380 --> 55:22.660]  these rats it's wake up paradigm shift and realize the only way out of this is
[55:22.660 --> 55:30.220]  admitting how much trouble we're in all right ladies and gentlemen they are
[55:30.220 --> 55:33.860]  really trying to deceive the public while they dumb the young people down as
[55:33.860 --> 55:39.060]  much as possible but let's cover some more of these reports the republicans
[55:39.060 --> 55:42.780]  come out and say hey we don't know why we have primaries all that matters is the
[55:42.780 --> 55:50.060]  delegates but what came first the chicken or the egg well the votes came
[55:50.060 --> 55:53.220]  first and then there for the delegates and everybody knows that oh but the
[55:53.220 --> 55:58.820]  parties got some rules in place in the 70s yeah and the rules are almost
[55:58.820 --> 56:02.620]  exactly the same and then they happen around the same time like we got the
[56:02.620 --> 56:05.940]  income tax and got rid of our senators being elected by the state
[56:05.940 --> 56:13.220]  legislatures and we got the private fell reserve the same week in 1913 magically
[56:13.220 --> 56:17.780]  and magically all the new appliances and all the new cars the last 10 years have
[56:17.780 --> 56:21.780]  tracker systems in it and magically they're gonna start taxing us and
[56:21.780 --> 56:27.380]  controlling our thermostats magically it all just fell together like evolution a
[56:27.380 --> 56:32.340]  fine Swiss watch you find in the Sahara Desert that the sand blew together or
[56:32.340 --> 56:37.140]  or down in the water the microbes got together and formed it oh yeah and all
[56:37.140 --> 56:41.780]  this tyranny just formed magically see now we're not debating is there a world
[56:41.780 --> 56:47.460]  government or not now we're debating
[56:49.940 --> 56:57.700]  should we submit to it or not see see first there wasn't a world government
[56:57.700 --> 57:01.580]  now now it's here they're announcing it and they're like well should we arrest
[57:01.580 --> 57:06.940]  people that disagree with it we have gone from it doesn't exist when they're
[57:06.940 --> 57:10.100]  all announcing it writing books setting it up to oh yeah it's here we're gonna
[57:10.100 --> 57:15.780]  arrest you all over the Western world and in the third world countries are
[57:15.780 --> 57:24.180]  leaders of finance the administrations of dictators socialists fascist oligarchs
[57:24.180 --> 57:28.460]  you name it they have death squads and kill the people that disagree with the
[57:28.460 --> 57:33.660]  government you you want to know what our oligarchs want for us that's it and
[57:33.660 --> 57:36.820]  that's why I've got a stack of liberal professors and black lives matter and
[57:36.820 --> 57:40.940]  everybody else saying oh we're going to go out and we're gonna get violent and
[57:40.940 --> 57:43.900]  we're going to we're taking people's free speech and we're gonna shut down
[57:43.900 --> 57:49.820]  Trump Tower blah blah blah blah blah now they've got some Trump supporters
[57:49.820 --> 57:54.060]  going we'll just fight back we'll riot oh and the globalists just we'll sit back
[57:54.060 --> 57:57.480]  and laugh at the whole thing but it does really beg the question she'll
[57:57.480 --> 58:01.140]  chesky was a dictator Romanian people filing over through him I mean if they
[58:01.140 --> 58:05.820]  really do start just appointing presidents openly people do have a
[58:05.820 --> 58:09.500]  right to resist that that's why they're branding the resistance though burning
[58:09.500 --> 58:12.860]  down your own neighborhoods and shooting cops while they pump gas that's not a
[58:12.860 --> 58:16.820]  revolution that has moral high ground is gonna win these be a restoration of
[58:16.820 --> 58:21.500]  the republic led by state governors and legislatures who meet and open the feds
[58:21.500 --> 58:24.740]  will probably try to come arrest them or blow it up it'll have such moral
[58:24.740 --> 58:28.340]  high ground most the feds are gonna end up joining them we'll then go into DC
[58:28.340 --> 58:32.820]  with special ops and arrest some of the top globalist have a big public trial
[58:32.820 --> 58:36.860]  forum like Nuremberg and then you know what happens you know what happens
[58:36.860 --> 58:40.820]  round the neck that's where it's going right there but all legal and lawful
[58:40.820 --> 58:44.580]  gonna string you up globalist gonna string you up I don't have a lust to
[58:44.580 --> 58:48.220]  get you but it's got to happen justice must be done you don't get strung up
[58:48.220 --> 58:54.940]  brain force it's completely different try a bottle of it rob do designs us you
[58:54.940 --> 58:59.660]  worked I guess like 20 plus hours tell us what brain force get I've been working

[59:04.460 --> 59:07.780]  was kind of run down you know I just didn't feel like I was gonna make it and
[59:07.780 --> 59:11.060]  I really want to do a good job on the interview I got my bottle of brain force
[59:11.060 --> 59:15.060]  right there pop two of them and about 20 minutes later it's like being everything

[59:27.900 --> 59:30.820]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while but I probably could not
[59:30.820 --> 59:35.020]  have done it without brain force I went home about 645 this morning took three
[59:35.020 --> 59:38.980]  hours of sleep got up took two more brain force and came in you will find a

[01:00:22.740 --> 01:00:26.340]  of drudge report dot com and drudge links to some backup stories where they
[01:00:26.340 --> 01:00:30.300]  admit the secret meetings that Roger Stone first exposed should have mentioned
[01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:34.980]  the last hour Roger Stone will be will be joining us the article is how the GOP
[01:00:34.980 --> 01:00:39.340]  elite plan to rob Donald Trump now I've not been taking a lot of calls lately but
[01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:43.380]  I started back yesterday and I said hey if you disagree with myself or Trump
[01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:47.180]  we're screening your calls all of you will disagree and it was interesting it
[01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:51.580]  was informative but that's not what we're doing now it's it's wide open
[01:00:51.580 --> 01:00:54.580]  phones for first-time callers I'll give the number out at the start of the next
[01:00:54.580 --> 01:01:00.980]  segment specifically on what do we do now that the Republican leadership is in
[01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:06.900]  the Washington Post the New York Times every major TV station Fox News saying
[01:01:06.900 --> 01:01:10.740]  yeah well of course we don't listen to popular vote of course the party decides
[01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:18.540]  who's president it's our club and you're not part of it let's come in with
[01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:25.580]  carlin next segment hey I like the puppet on the left hey I like the puppet
[01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:32.500]  on the right hey wait a minute there's one guy holding both puppets shut up quote
[01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:39.900]  late great Bill Hicks it is surreal to play Bill Hicks clips on the show and
[01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:44.460]  have a large portion of mentally ill people thinking on Bill Hicks if you're
[01:01:44.460 --> 01:01:48.980]  a new listener I'm not kidding and the mainstream media has trolled it they've
[01:01:48.980 --> 01:01:56.700]  had actual national and statewide news articles on it I mean hell I look a
[01:01:56.700 --> 01:02:01.340]  little older from my age of 42 but I'm not how will Bill Hicks be like 55 60
[01:02:01.340 --> 01:02:09.620]  years on them but I've got two eyes and a nose and I'm from Texas so it must be
[01:02:09.620 --> 01:02:14.340]  true I'm digressing I'm sorry it's like I'm talking about Best in Show and
[01:02:14.340 --> 01:02:17.860]  Spinal Tap that I realized they made a movie based on my infiltration Bohemian
[01:02:17.860 --> 01:02:21.540]  Grove teddy bears picnic and I don't know I'm like name-dropping to plug that I
[01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:24.460]  just talk about Bill Hicks that I go wait a minute they say I'm Bill Hicks
[01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:28.660]  I'm not doing that on purpose it's just so ridiculous that people will talk about
[01:02:28.660 --> 01:02:32.180]  FEMA camps all day long but they'll never go look at the emergency centers
[01:02:32.180 --> 01:02:36.860]  establishment act or the resettlement act or the civilian and make labor camp
[01:02:36.860 --> 01:02:40.700]  program and all the construction of them and the army documents how they're
[01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:48.340]  gonna process our families and they call it a reeducation camp no one cares I
[01:02:48.340 --> 01:02:51.940]  mean we'll have an article of all the huge breaking documents it's just like
[01:02:51.940 --> 01:02:57.540]  yeah the people actually do care but it's like I can put a photo up of some
[01:02:57.540 --> 01:03:07.140]  under you know pass water aqueduct and say I heard there's a FEMA base in there
[01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:11.300]  and it'd be like 20 million reads top story on the internet so you know we
[01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:16.340]  we've come a long way but I could take a photo of an old shoe in the street and
[01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:22.860]  say mystery surrounds shoe and be probably the top story on the internet
[01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:26.140]  you know I actually know how to troll the internet but it's weird I like
[01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:30.860]  metaphysically can't do it I like have to try to really be accurate and only
[01:03:30.860 --> 01:03:36.380]  cover hardcore info that's documented I don't do a lot of comedy anymore even
[01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:39.980]  though that's gallo sewer and I need to do it I need to screw around I need to
[01:03:39.980 --> 01:03:43.180]  joke around lately I've been really freaked out I've been really I've been
[01:03:43.180 --> 01:03:49.220]  really mean off air some and I've been very angry and I've just prayed to God
[01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:56.940]  to please not make me this angry but I mean I really do know what's going on
[01:03:56.940 --> 01:03:59.860]  and I know how to stop these people and I'm seeing them closing in on us and
[01:03:59.860 --> 01:04:02.300]  they're getting more and more arrogant they're saying they want to arrest
[01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:05.500]  everybody now they disagree with they're building FEMA camps and they say
[01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:09.620]  they're gonna openly steal elections from us because they're worried about the
[01:04:09.620 --> 01:04:15.060]  fascism of Donald Trump that's like Satan pointing at a man and saying I'm
[01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:19.980]  worried he's a fallen creature yeah Donald Trump's a fallen creature so am I
[01:04:19.980 --> 01:04:26.780]  you my friend are a certified bonafide I'm talking to Boehner and Obama and

[01:08:12.220 --> 01:08:17.020]  about the real owners now the real owners the big wealthy business interest
[01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:20.340]  to control things and make all the important decisions forget the
[01:08:20.340 --> 01:08:23.820]  politicians the politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have
[01:08:23.820 --> 01:08:32.420]  freedom of choice you don't you have no choice you have owners they own you they
[01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:36.840]  own everything they own all the important land they own and control the
[01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:39.980]  corporations they've long since bought and paid for the senate the congress the
[01:08:39.980 --> 01:08:43.220]  state houses and city halls they got the judges in their back pockets and they
[01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:46.700]  own all the big media companies so they control just about all of the news and
[01:08:46.700 --> 01:08:53.100]  information you get to hear they got you by the balls they want obedient workers
[01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:57.900]  obedient workers people who are just smart enough to run the machines and do
[01:08:57.900 --> 01:09:02.300]  the paperwork and just dumb enough to passively accept jobs with a lower pay
[01:09:02.300 --> 01:09:06.180]  the longer hours to reduce benefits the end of overtime and the vanishing
[01:09:06.180 --> 01:09:09.580]  pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it and now they're coming
[01:09:09.580 --> 01:09:13.980]  for your social security money so they can give it to their criminal friends on
[01:09:13.980 --> 01:09:20.740]  Wall Street it's a big club and you ain't in it and you said recently quote when
[01:09:20.740 --> 01:09:25.540]  you give they do whatever the hell you want them to do you better believe it
[01:09:25.540 --> 01:09:29.940]  so what specifically didn't they do if I ask them if I need them you know most
[01:09:29.940 --> 01:09:33.860]  of the people on this stage I've given to just so you understand a lot of money
[01:09:33.860 --> 01:09:39.460]  you and I are not in the big club the owners of this country know the truth
[01:09:39.460 --> 01:09:45.460]  it's called the American dream because you have to be asleep to believe it but
[01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:49.380]  I'll tell you what they don't want they don't want a population of citizens
[01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:53.420]  capable of critical thinking they don't want well-informed well-educated people
[01:09:53.420 --> 01:09:56.740]  capable of critical thinking they're not interested in that that doesn't help them
[01:09:56.740 --> 01:10:01.420]  that's against their interest that's right from the front lines of the
[01:10:01.420 --> 01:10:09.620]  information war it's Alex Jones and the reason I'm against this global elite is
[01:10:09.620 --> 01:10:12.980]  because they really do want dumbed-down humanity so they can dominate and rule
[01:10:12.980 --> 01:10:18.100]  us and that's committing a crime against the species they build nuclear
[01:10:18.100 --> 01:10:25.300]  reactors on fault lines exclusively pretty much exclusively they don't care
[01:10:25.300 --> 01:10:28.820]  about horrible things they're genetically engineering everything they act like
[01:10:28.820 --> 01:10:34.860]  literal demons this is how I would expect a horde of 50 million demons
[01:10:34.860 --> 01:10:38.220]  landing on the planet to behave
[01:10:38.820 --> 01:10:42.180]  because if you were really evil you wouldn't just kill individuals you try to
[01:10:42.180 --> 01:10:47.340]  kill the source of life while claiming you're defending the earth that's always
[01:10:47.340 --> 01:10:50.740]  the funnest part about them oh we're gonna save you from carbon that's part of
[01:10:50.740 --> 01:10:54.420]  the carbon cycle sunlight water
[01:10:54.660 --> 01:11:02.860]  carbon oxygen gotta have those four things water sunlight carbon dioxide
[01:11:02.860 --> 01:11:08.460]  oxygen and they're gonna tax and regulate one of those I mean duh game over
[01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:12.740]  total takeover in their own words
[01:11:12.740 --> 01:11:17.860]  I've talked about this a lot because it's more important than everything else
[01:11:17.860 --> 01:11:23.180]  I'm about to get to in Trinity and beyond hosted by William Shatner I think
[01:11:23.180 --> 01:11:31.540]  came out like 98 I'd already read about this but I saw the HD footage that the
[01:11:31.540 --> 01:11:35.740]  army had never released and the Air Force of them detonating over a hundred
[01:11:35.740 --> 01:11:41.260]  hydrogen bombs in the upper atmosphere quote trying to blow a hole in the
[01:11:41.260 --> 01:11:45.700]  atmosphere to see if they could drain the earth's atmosphere or catch it on
[01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:52.660]  fire or blow up the Van Allen radiation belt blow a hole at it well who who does
[01:11:52.660 --> 01:11:59.420]  that and it wasn't the military it was the crazy scientists and the 36,000
[01:11:59.420 --> 01:12:06.140]  whack job Nazis they brought back over here these are crazy people super high
[01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:10.020]  IQs but like a high IQ dog you've been around the smartest dogs and they're
[01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:14.820]  really weird like a high-bred collie or a high-bred German Shepherd or a high-bred
[01:12:14.820 --> 01:12:19.260]  Russell Terrier they're nice little dogs they do weird stuff they're aggressive
[01:12:19.260 --> 01:12:22.700]  and they're sneaky and they they do not give them the neurotic stuff smart dogs
[01:12:22.700 --> 01:12:27.180]  do we all know well the globalists it's like a hundred times worse they're a
[01:12:27.180 --> 01:12:32.580]  bunch of whack jobs so you got all these 180 IQ crazy Germans mixed him with a
[01:12:32.580 --> 01:12:38.220]  bunch of 180 IQ crazy Jews and a bunch of 180 IQ crazy northern Europeans and
[01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:42.260]  Asians and everybody else you know Latin America you name it they're all in the
[01:12:42.260 --> 01:12:47.820]  same crazy clubs they're all into killing and manipulation so they're not
[01:12:47.820 --> 01:12:51.420]  German they're not Jewish they're not Chinese they're control freak psycho nuts
[01:12:51.420 --> 01:12:57.740]  who get off and trying to blow up blow holes in the atmosphere and a lot of
[01:12:57.740 --> 01:13:01.100]  scientists think some of the holes in the ozone layer are from the high
[01:13:01.100 --> 01:13:05.620]  altitude atomic testing I guess they found it online they're now showing them
[01:13:05.620 --> 01:13:11.180]  launch hundreds of hydrogen bombs trying to blow up the atmosphere that's
[01:13:11.180 --> 01:13:17.860]  good they'll hit us with copyright they're trying to show you how they're
[01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:20.980]  trying to blow holes in the atmosphere if we show too much because it's not
[01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:25.020]  fair use commentary to say please don't use our tax money to blow up the
[01:13:25.020 --> 01:13:30.300]  atmosphere it is fair uses original government footage actually they're
[01:13:30.300 --> 01:13:32.540]  just trying to shut down our YouTube channel right now they're trying to kick
[01:13:32.540 --> 01:13:36.780]  us off Facebook they may be successful or try they got infiltrators literally
[01:13:36.780 --> 01:13:41.820]  trying to get in the building I'm not gonna whine about it I'm just here at
[01:13:41.820 --> 01:13:46.540]  my post watching civilization melt down around me and I just I don't blame
[01:13:46.540 --> 01:13:49.580]  people just want to say conspiracy theory because you hear stuff like this
[01:13:49.580 --> 01:13:52.460]  and you just don't want to admit it because if you did admit it you'd have
[01:13:52.460 --> 01:13:56.820]  to do something right you're meant to do something it's animating to do
[01:13:56.820 --> 01:14:03.460]  something it's fulfilling to do something it's empowering now you can go
[01:14:03.460 --> 01:14:09.220]  too far like I have and it becomes a total commitment where I don't even
[01:14:09.220 --> 01:14:14.860]  really exist anymore every thought is on this because I see it everywhere they
[01:14:14.860 --> 01:14:21.820]  have built this stinking prison to try to jack us and I'm not gonna put up with
[01:14:21.820 --> 01:14:28.260]  it anymore I want it to come down because it's holding us down like a
[01:14:28.260 --> 01:14:35.660]  tether to a hot air balloon I want to escape from the hell they're trying to
[01:14:35.660 --> 01:14:38.780]  build you know the devil doesn't like the fact that he's destined for Hades so
[01:14:38.780 --> 01:14:42.300]  he wants to take us with him and build a hell here I'm telling you that's what
[01:14:42.300 --> 01:14:47.900]  it is I even if the devil doesn't exist as an entity seven and a half billion
[01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:51.780]  people manipulated by these technocrats are manifesting that devil and making
[01:14:51.780 --> 01:14:56.620]  that devil as Ray Kurzweil said I don't believe in God yet I am gonna become
[01:14:56.620 --> 01:15:01.700]  God if that doesn't sound like something on the mouth of a long tailed devil I
[01:15:01.700 --> 01:15:09.220]  don't know what is all right let me get back into the news I want to take your
[01:15:09.220 --> 01:15:16.380]  phone calls first-time callers specifically on the RNC leadership
[01:15:16.380 --> 01:15:20.060]  coming out and saying yes we did meet in secret now we're public we're gonna
[01:15:20.060 --> 01:15:23.380]  take the nomination from Donald Trump fact we don't even care if he gets the
[01:15:23.380 --> 01:15:29.140]  magic 1100 and whatever number we're just taking it and guess what you
[01:15:29.140 --> 01:15:33.060]  shouldn't even vote the head of the Republican Party from North Dakota goes
[01:15:33.060 --> 01:15:36.580]  on Fox News I played the clip twice last hour about to play it again and says
[01:15:36.580 --> 01:15:40.660]  yeah I don't even know why you do vote you're right I'm gonna throw it in your
[01:15:40.660 --> 01:15:44.940]  face the media is misrepresented it's the delegates and super delegates that
[01:15:44.940 --> 01:15:49.540]  matter because you're sworn to take the votes of your precinct and go up there
[01:15:49.540 --> 01:15:55.300]  and represent the people back when folks had to get on a you know horse and
[01:15:55.300 --> 01:16:00.860]  carriage and travel hundreds of miles was a big event it was back then if you
[01:16:00.860 --> 01:16:03.500]  tried to skip your delegate or do something I've read stories about it
[01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:08.140]  when you got back to your town the mayor would come to your door or another
[01:16:08.140 --> 01:16:11.540]  top person in the town you had to be a manly man to be a leader back then and
[01:16:11.540 --> 01:16:19.340]  say mr. Johnson or mr. Brown or whatever your name was the reports are in the
[01:16:19.340 --> 01:16:25.180]  papers that when you traveled to that city for the convention that you pledged
[01:16:25.180 --> 01:16:32.740]  the votes of this town to another candidate well yes I did do that because
[01:16:32.740 --> 01:16:38.180]  I thought well get your second I will meet you in one hour in the town square
[01:16:38.180 --> 01:16:44.660]  your choice swords or muskets and folks there were thousands of people
[01:16:44.660 --> 01:16:53.500]  thousands killed over not look it up over not following political pledges when
[01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:57.620]  people were set as legates that's what there's an old Roman term to go
[01:16:57.620 --> 01:17:07.260]  represent people they come to your door I've got my second right here and the
[01:17:07.260 --> 01:17:11.700]  person didn't come out and fight they take off a glove and go you coward slap
[01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:16.140]  them right across the face you want to steal our votes you're gonna get to face
[01:17:16.140 --> 01:17:22.700]  somebody you're gonna face death now that's where America came from by the
[01:17:22.700 --> 01:17:28.180]  1880s they made it illegal but that's what you see in high noon it ended in the
[01:17:28.180 --> 01:17:31.660]  West last where you did something you were allowed to go out in town square
[01:17:31.660 --> 01:17:38.340]  with your guns and get quote satisfaction now that's where we came from
[01:17:38.340 --> 01:17:47.460]  I'm not calling for that today I'm just telling you where all this is going if
[01:17:47.460 --> 01:17:51.300]  US senators didn't do what the legislators that elected them told them to
[01:17:51.300 --> 01:17:58.340]  do they were brought back and sometimes were indicted by the state they weren't
[01:17:58.340 --> 01:18:02.100]  just recalled they would have that senator in the legislature in Texas
[01:18:02.100 --> 01:18:08.300]  Tennessee New York didn't matter Florida right down there on trial you didn't do
[01:18:08.300 --> 01:18:13.180]  in the voting exactly what we told you to do look how ass backwards that is
[01:18:13.180 --> 01:18:21.780]  today so I want to ask you I'm somebody that wants to fix this peacefully but
[01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:26.660]  when we have open appointed presidents openly stolen elections and homeland
[01:18:26.660 --> 01:18:30.060]  security with armored vehicles gearing up for war against the American people and
[01:18:30.060 --> 01:18:37.260]  saying a civil war is coming and they're run by foreign interest what is the point
[01:18:37.260 --> 01:18:41.420]  at which we resist these people will the American people they steal elections in
[01:18:41.420 --> 01:18:45.500]  front of us to say well they arrested that governor because he said they
[01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:48.980]  should have followed the vote oh do you hear the army went down and got these
[01:18:48.980 --> 01:18:52.180]  state senators did you hear this congressman got arrested you know Lincoln
[01:18:52.180 --> 01:18:57.900]  did that and they've the Democrats say Obama is modeling himself after Lincoln
[01:18:58.740 --> 01:19:03.540]  and just like the Civil War they'll bring in some red herring of racism
[01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:09.940]  nothing to do with it until the end they used abolitionist fervor though for
[01:19:09.940 --> 01:19:14.580]  the one moral high ground against the south which was a real moral high ground
[01:19:14.580 --> 01:19:17.540]  but had nothing to do with it read the letters of Lincoln they're online you

[01:20:26.740 --> 01:20:30.180]  and they brought the price down and then when we still said no they brought in
[01:20:30.180 --> 01:20:33.060]  the manager and they brought the price down even lower and they started
[01:20:33.060 --> 01:20:35.700]  breaking in different ways to make it look like it was this really awesome

[01:26:17.820 --> 01:26:24.980]  best bands of all time let's get back to that clip before I come back in the
[01:26:24.980 --> 01:26:29.940]  next break in a segment and take your calls let's play the head of the RNC in
[01:26:29.940 --> 01:26:33.940]  North Dakota and this is in the news I mean the party heads have said we're
[01:26:33.940 --> 01:26:36.260]  not gonna let Trump have it we're gonna do a broker convention that's been the
[01:26:36.260 --> 01:26:41.420]  Boston Post we rather Hillary win Mitch McConnell just just outrageous we're we
[01:26:41.420 --> 01:26:49.740]  change the rules we run the government we're saying it's legal your vote
[01:26:49.740 --> 01:26:57.860]  doesn't count this is an oligarchy now what a incredible statement gloves are
[01:26:57.860 --> 01:27:01.580]  off folks they're unclogged now out of weakness not out of strength we have
[01:27:01.580 --> 01:27:05.980]  fought them we have exposed them and now the enemy is unclogged that's why I
[01:27:05.980 --> 01:27:11.580]  always say resistances victory if you just lay down then that natural law
[01:27:11.580 --> 01:27:17.420]  Newtonian physics doesn't apply it only applies when you stand up then for every
[01:27:17.420 --> 01:27:25.220]  action there's an equal and opposite reaction they're masters of diverting
[01:27:25.220 --> 01:27:32.940]  people off down rabbit trails they live they're awake while we sleep the
[01:27:32.940 --> 01:27:37.540]  awakening is here let's go to this again I've got dozens of clips here I'm not
[01:27:37.540 --> 01:27:39.900]  just playing this time don't have material I've got tons of stuff talking
[01:27:39.900 --> 01:27:48.260]  about here but this is so sensational we've got senior GOP official Curly
[01:27:48.260 --> 01:27:56.460]  Hewland Holland we choose the nominee not the voters listen to this epic clip and
[01:27:56.460 --> 01:28:01.780]  then on the end the national news they go so why even have voters why haven't
[01:28:01.780 --> 01:28:07.980]  had primaries he goes good point the party leadership appoints the delegates
[01:28:07.980 --> 01:28:15.020]  and super delegates and they tell them what to do and then they just announced
[01:28:15.020 --> 01:28:19.540]  whatever they want well why not just have one guy doing it then why oh no it's a
[01:28:19.540 --> 01:28:24.300]  whole coterie of people remember what Gruber said he goes thank God the
[01:28:24.300 --> 01:28:28.820]  American people are so dumb I was that I was tasked with tripling prizes for the
[01:28:28.820 --> 01:28:32.860]  insurance companies to rape everyone so I went out and lied to everybody the
[01:28:32.860 --> 01:28:37.140]  president adopted my lies those other groups competing with their lies and the
[01:28:37.140 --> 01:28:41.220]  other professors are oh my gosh could I could I be part of the lying and all the
[01:28:41.220 --> 01:28:46.500]  PhD students are oh my dissertation on lying I'm learning how to be a scumbag oh
[01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:51.780]  that'll get us to Alpha Centuries let's got a break with this club here it is
[01:28:51.780 --> 01:28:55.700]  I don't think that's the case once it's you know if it would just be understood
[01:28:55.700 --> 01:28:59.660]  we have a problem with the media unfortunately the cable networks are
[01:28:59.660 --> 01:29:02.420]  trying to determine I don't think this is a problem with the media I've heard
[01:29:02.420 --> 01:29:06.180]  from a lot of voters who say if they feel like their votes got stolen that they
[01:29:06.180 --> 01:29:09.060]  would be very unhappy and very angry I think you're looking at a different
[01:29:09.060 --> 01:29:11.740]  situation I realize these have been the rules but the last time these rules were
[01:29:11.740 --> 01:29:16.180]  put in place was 1976 it's been a long time since that and they're still there
[01:29:16.180 --> 01:29:21.780]  yeah that's a problem the the the media has created the perception that the
[01:29:21.780 --> 01:29:25.180]  voters will decide the nomination and that's the content that's the conflict
[01:29:25.180 --> 01:29:28.860]  here we live in a democratic society what you're telling me is it's not a
[01:29:28.860 --> 01:29:31.680]  democratic society and your votes don't necessarily matter because it's a
[01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:35.540]  democratic representation correct no that's not what I'm trying to tell you
[01:29:35.540 --> 01:29:39.420]  what I'm trying to say is that we're just one of the political parties there's
[01:29:39.420 --> 01:29:42.540]  many political parties the political parties choose their nominee not the
[01:29:42.540 --> 01:29:47.140]  general public contrary to popular belief and why are you holding the
[01:29:47.140 --> 01:29:53.700]  primaries we're on the March the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN

[01:34:03.340 --> 01:34:10.140]  silly bird oh you're one of those crazy conspiracy theorist you thought you're
[01:34:10.140 --> 01:34:18.660]  vocated with some of the most arrogant pathetic people are the RNC heads of
[01:34:18.660 --> 01:34:23.740]  states DNC heads are the delegates and super delegates we played Democrats
[01:34:23.740 --> 01:34:26.940]  we've interviewed Democrats in New Hampshire one of us a super delegate
[01:34:26.940 --> 01:34:30.460]  from California goes I've talked to everybody we're all party officials we
[01:34:30.460 --> 01:34:36.900]  elect each other it doesn't matter a Bernie wins here Hillary gets the
[01:34:36.900 --> 01:34:42.100]  delegates and then two days later he won by 20 points and she got more
[01:34:42.100 --> 01:34:48.580]  delegates that's how it works see you win the NASCAR race but the party bosses
[01:34:48.580 --> 01:34:52.980]  decide that the car 20 cars back wins you didn't know that you thought the
[01:34:52.980 --> 01:34:56.380]  winner of the race won the race you thought the guy in a boxing match that
[01:34:56.380 --> 01:35:02.980]  knocks the other guy out wins no no no no no no no no no no you sit out and you
[01:35:02.980 --> 01:35:08.820]  shut up and we forced them to be out in the open think about the stuff they
[01:35:08.820 --> 01:35:11.580]  denied just a few years ago now it's just yeah we're not gonna listen to your
[01:35:11.580 --> 01:35:14.700]  vote yeah mm-hmm we're gonna have that in plain view by the way got armored
[01:35:14.700 --> 01:35:18.540]  vehicles and special forces standing by oh really go ahead and try to use those
[01:35:18.540 --> 01:35:23.980]  when you pull all this kind of crap off and by the way I'm not some guy
[01:35:23.980 --> 01:35:29.620]  spoiling for a physical civil war I'm smart enough I'm historic enough and I
[01:35:29.620 --> 01:35:33.580]  have been in the street enough to know that's not fun but I'll tell you one
[01:35:33.580 --> 01:35:44.860]  thing gloves come off all of the nice friendly patriots of this country
[01:35:44.860 --> 01:35:50.620]  aren't like all the fake evil people and fake tough guys we don't fight because
[01:35:50.620 --> 01:35:58.300]  we want to oppress people we don't fight because we want to dominate people we
[01:35:58.300 --> 01:36:02.500]  don't fight because we're parasites and we have a will to dominate the
[01:36:02.500 --> 01:36:07.700]  innocent we fight because we have a responsibility and a duty to stand up
[01:36:07.700 --> 01:36:18.780]  for the innocent and the establishment has taken our kindness our patience our
[01:36:18.780 --> 01:36:25.580]  intelligence for weakness but for 60 years the Liberty movement has fought
[01:36:25.580 --> 01:36:30.180]  the global's takeover and it's probably more than 15 years behind now because of
[01:36:30.180 --> 01:36:34.820]  all those patriots great men and women that that that that that I'm nothing
[01:36:34.820 --> 01:36:41.020]  compared to who went through hell they tortured multiple members of Congress for
[01:36:41.020 --> 01:36:44.420]  talking about this like Congressman Hanson
[01:36:44.420 --> 01:36:56.260]  torturing till he was basically insane but after he got out he was okay till his
[01:36:56.260 --> 01:37:00.620]  feet burst up and he almost rotted off because he was having hearings on the
[01:37:00.620 --> 01:37:09.860]  IRS countless other people that killed tortured countless police FBI agents you
[01:37:09.860 --> 01:37:18.060]  name it Larry McDonald Democrat would have been the stuff of made Ronald Reagan
[01:37:18.060 --> 01:37:22.860]  look like a wimp they landed that plane took him off and the word is they
[01:37:22.860 --> 01:37:33.260]  tortured him long and hard a deal with the Russians take care of that problem
[01:37:33.260 --> 01:37:37.380]  he'd go on crossfire and talk about everything we talk about here in the
[01:37:37.380 --> 01:37:44.460]  early 80s they killed him better than hammer not before they had their way
[01:37:44.460 --> 01:37:54.540]  with him for a long time these are demons we're dealing with so just remember
[01:37:54.540 --> 01:38:03.220]  who we're up against understand bowing to him only makes it worse yeah
[01:38:03.220 --> 01:38:06.220]  congressman Hanson I tried to get him on recently and he they told me was very
[01:38:06.220 --> 01:38:12.220]  sick and he since died there's so many others I could talk about but they were
[01:38:12.220 --> 01:38:20.940]  so right they were so ahead of their time and so for 60 years we've been trying
[01:38:20.940 --> 01:38:24.460]  to politically change things but I want to tell the New World Order something
[01:38:24.460 --> 01:38:31.700]  you'll understand this our stay behind networks not like yours in Europe but
[01:38:31.700 --> 01:38:37.820]  our stay behind networks if you actually take over it's when you physically
[01:38:37.820 --> 01:38:43.340]  completely take over the real war starts and I want to advise all the fools
[01:38:43.340 --> 01:38:47.700]  that think this is going to be fun to crush the patriots of this country and
[01:38:47.700 --> 01:38:56.820]  all the leftist fake tough you are not going to be happy when you face the
[01:38:56.820 --> 01:39:02.980]  crazy brave and I don't take any pleasure in what could be coming to this
[01:39:02.980 --> 01:39:10.620]  country because garbage being smashed isn't anything it's like walking out
[01:39:10.620 --> 01:39:19.900]  your yard and stepping in dog manure you got to wipe it off your shoes they've
[01:39:19.900 --> 01:39:22.740]  set this whole thing up where people like Soros and others think they're
[01:39:22.740 --> 01:39:29.300]  going to stay above the fray there's not going to be anywhere on earth that
[01:39:29.300 --> 01:39:37.140]  that entity is going to be able to hide from his crimes
[01:39:37.900 --> 01:39:44.660]  you imagine he was a high-level Nazi collaborator rounding up thousands of
[01:39:44.660 --> 01:39:51.180]  people when he was 13 14 15 and 16 and that guy is still alive now trying to
[01:39:51.180 --> 01:39:56.860]  kill this country you would believe that in a fiction book where there's some
[01:39:56.860 --> 01:40:01.300]  weirdo Nazi collaborator running the country and starting civil wars all over
[01:40:01.300 --> 01:40:05.420]  the world and trying to start World War three with Russia well why do we put up
[01:40:05.420 --> 01:40:07.820]  with him
[01:40:10.660 --> 01:40:19.700]  mi6 basically wrote the new James Bond movie and quantum is the company that
[01:40:19.700 --> 01:40:26.820]  actually runs specter and of course the name of George Soros's fund is quantum
[01:40:30.300 --> 01:40:34.940]  and that's because there are different factions and mi6 knows Soros is
[01:40:34.940 --> 01:40:41.740]  continually trying to crash the British Pound when I went to England to cover
[01:40:41.740 --> 01:40:46.940]  Bilderberg I had mi6 come visit with me mi5 and the local police constabulary
[01:40:46.940 --> 01:40:54.780]  head himself was a spook he was over four counties and they all basically looked
[01:40:54.780 --> 01:40:57.860]  at me and it wasn't an act and they said you don't think we don't know all this
[01:40:57.860 --> 01:41:01.100]  you don't think we don't know what's happening in this country you don't think
[01:41:01.100 --> 01:41:05.900]  we're out of where you need to learn who your friends are we've gone through a
[01:41:05.900 --> 01:41:09.260]  lot of trouble to make sure that you're even able to be here and cover this and
[01:41:09.260 --> 01:41:14.860]  it was true and that's it you imagine being in the government having to sit
[01:41:14.860 --> 01:41:19.020]  there while this trash runs your country in the ground and then you get all the
[01:41:19.020 --> 01:41:23.540]  blame for it and then they want us to have a civil war with all the feds
[01:41:23.540 --> 01:41:27.100]  which is what they want to bring the country down it isn't that there aren't
[01:41:27.100 --> 01:41:32.080]  bad feds who deserve to be in trouble it's that the globalist want to have the
[01:41:32.080 --> 01:41:36.900]  civil war and I don't want to have it but they are pushing for it on every
[01:41:36.900 --> 01:41:41.260]  front openly trying to steal the election from the American people not from
[01:41:41.260 --> 01:41:47.140]  Donald Trump at the primary level while they get the leftist black lives matter
[01:41:47.140 --> 01:41:53.580]  group wound up on the left and the Donald Trump people wound up on the right
[01:41:53.740 --> 01:42:00.580]  with all this other craziness unfolding we're headed into a key time right now
[01:42:00.580 --> 01:42:05.540]  I want to play this clip one more time than that's it for the broadcast I might
[01:42:05.540 --> 01:42:08.980]  play it once more with stones on but but this is CNBC is another one on Fox
[01:42:08.980 --> 01:42:13.900]  this is CNBC the head of the Republican Party North Dakota don't hey media
[01:42:13.900 --> 01:42:16.900]  don't act like we're stealing something we change the rule where your vote
[01:42:16.900 --> 01:42:20.180]  doesn't count and she goes oh well then what you said to have primaries are
[01:42:20.180 --> 01:42:26.340]  voting he goes yes they're so warped they think if they pass a rule it means
[01:42:26.340 --> 01:42:30.940]  they can just ignore everything that that gives them cover like the Nazis
[01:42:30.940 --> 01:42:35.420]  passing laws that they could do a horrible things
[01:42:35.420 --> 01:42:40.380]  but what does it say about this establishment and what they think about
[01:42:40.380 --> 01:42:46.220]  us they either think we're the dumbest people in history or they want to cause
[01:42:46.220 --> 01:42:50.260]  civil unrest and they're not stupid they know there's a large portion of people
[01:42:50.260 --> 01:42:55.620]  that are getting angry they're getting wound up and now they want to play the
[01:42:55.620 --> 01:42:59.220]  political parties off against each other and suicide basically both of them but
[01:42:59.220 --> 01:43:02.740]  the Republican Party wants to blow itself up like a suicide bomber so the
[01:43:02.740 --> 01:43:06.300]  Democrats can completely take over this is the deal being made by the
[01:43:06.300 --> 01:43:09.860]  Republican leadership right now
[01:43:10.260 --> 01:43:15.020]  and let me tell you when you're 87 years old or whatever Sorrow says he's so
[01:43:15.020 --> 01:43:18.580]  evil and so into crazy risk and stuff this is entertaining to him that it's
[01:43:18.580 --> 01:43:21.660]  so dangerous for him in the world it's entertaining there could be nuclear war
[01:43:21.660 --> 01:43:26.940]  with Russia it's fun for him that's why it's not a threat when I say they're
[01:43:26.940 --> 01:43:32.140]  gonna be held accountable because they love it this is a high stakes poker game
[01:43:32.140 --> 01:43:38.340]  for them but the ignorance of the people has what has allowed this cancer to
[01:43:38.340 --> 01:43:42.060]  metastasize and grow let's play the clip that I'm going to sherry marty
[01:43:42.060 --> 01:43:47.860]  JD William crystal and others I'm asking the question what is your line in the
[01:43:47.860 --> 01:43:52.420]  sand not that I'm baiting you to like call for violence or want to have
[01:43:52.420 --> 01:43:56.220]  violence it's not that I'm even scared to talk about defending ourselves in the
[01:43:56.220 --> 01:43:58.700]  right to revolt that's in the Constitution Bill of Rights Declaration of
[01:43:58.700 --> 01:44:01.780]  Independence I truly don't think this is the point for that that's a last
[01:44:01.780 --> 01:44:06.140]  ditch effort that's why the second amendment comes after the first you got
[01:44:06.140 --> 01:44:09.700]  the 10th of the 9th and all the rest I truly believe that's the wrong move at
[01:44:09.700 --> 01:44:13.860]  this point but they may intend to keep pushing forever so I want to know what
[01:44:13.860 --> 01:44:20.700]  is your line in the sand my kids aren't taking any of your deadly vaccines I don't
[01:44:20.700 --> 01:44:24.500]  care any lemmings you've got saying how great they are I've got the facts I'm
[01:44:24.500 --> 01:44:27.820]  not going to your forced labor camp to have some potbellied you know Bernie
[01:44:27.820 --> 01:44:36.700]  Sanders graduate you know ruling over me for his ego I'm not going to be part of
[01:44:36.700 --> 01:44:44.860]  this and we're facing the mortality of this country right now and a freedom
[01:44:44.860 --> 01:44:48.660]  worldwide let's play the clip here just don't think that's the case once it's
[01:44:48.660 --> 01:44:51.780]  it you know if it would just be understood we have a problem with the
[01:44:51.780 --> 01:44:56.740]  media unfortunately the cable network I don't think this is a problem with the
[01:44:56.740 --> 01:44:59.900]  media I've heard from a lot of voters who say if they feel like their votes got
[01:44:59.900 --> 01:45:03.820]  stolen that they would be very unhappy and very angry I think you're looking at
[01:45:03.820 --> 01:45:06.260]  a different situation I realize these have been the rules but the last time
[01:45:06.260 --> 01:45:10.500]  these rules were put in place was 1976 it's been a long time since that yeah
[01:45:10.500 --> 01:45:15.740]  they're still there yeah that's a problem the the the media has created a
[01:45:15.740 --> 01:45:19.300]  perception that the voters will decide the nomination and that's the content
[01:45:19.300 --> 01:45:23.260]  that's the conflict here we live in a democratic society what you're telling
[01:45:23.260 --> 01:45:26.140]  me is it's not a democratic society and your votes don't necessarily matter
[01:45:26.140 --> 01:45:29.860]  because it's a democratic representation correct no that's not what
[01:45:29.860 --> 01:45:32.780]  I'm trying to tell you what I'm trying to say is that there's a we're just one
[01:45:32.780 --> 01:45:36.300]  of the political parties there's many political parties the political parties
[01:45:36.300 --> 01:45:41.260]  choose their nominee not the general public contrary to popular belief and
[01:45:41.260 --> 01:45:49.500]  why are you holding the primaries that's a very good question all right
[01:45:49.500 --> 01:45:53.420]  that's RNC rules committee member he makes the national rules
[01:45:53.420 --> 01:46:00.780]  heather republican party North Dakota and his job is to hide this heist in
[01:46:00.780 --> 01:46:05.380]  plain view it's like you you you got a babysitter and God forbid you open the
[01:46:05.380 --> 01:46:11.060]  door and the babysitter has you know got your kids pants down and is performing
[01:46:11.060 --> 01:46:13.540]  a sex act on them and they just try to run and go nothing to see here
[01:46:13.540 --> 01:46:18.220]  everything's fine I'm just following the law right now that's what they're doing
[01:46:18.220 --> 01:46:21.620]  they're just real calmly it's like you go up your house and the guys walking out
[01:46:21.620 --> 01:46:25.380]  with your watch jewelry and computers and TVs like oh we're just doing a safety
[01:46:25.380 --> 01:46:30.180]  inspection sir like you're robbing me you're like no we're not these aren't
[01:46:30.180 --> 01:46:34.620]  the droids you're looking for move along this is the mind game this is the
[01:46:34.620 --> 01:46:39.940]  brainwashing you could have a whole college course just on that 70-second
[01:46:39.940 --> 01:46:45.260]  clip tell you huh yeah problems you in the media you don't seem to understand
[01:46:45.260 --> 01:46:49.420]  this is how we do it yeah I guess yeah cuz your vote doesn't matter yeah okay
[01:46:49.420 --> 01:46:53.340]  yeah why even have primaries I agree with you okay well that's just how it is
[01:46:53.340 --> 01:46:59.540]  things a lot guys it's all about everything's normal I learned real quick
[01:46:59.540 --> 01:47:04.980]  when I was dove or quail hunting that I had the stance of a hunter walk around a
[01:47:04.980 --> 01:47:09.700]  field birds 200 yards away would fly off but I've acted stupid and acted like I
[01:47:09.700 --> 01:47:13.620]  was picking a mushroom or looking at something and kind of just acted dumb
[01:47:13.620 --> 01:47:18.580]  with body language they'd sit there till I got right up to the tree they were in
[01:47:18.580 --> 01:47:26.860]  the predator is sneaking up we're a more sophisticated predator you see cuz
[01:47:26.860 --> 01:47:29.740]  you're only sneaking cuz you haven't been seen yet but see the bird already
[01:47:29.740 --> 01:47:33.700]  sees you so you act like you're not sneaking it'll let you walk within 30
[01:47:33.700 --> 01:47:38.020]  feet of it and then I blasted out of that tree with my 12 gauge maybe for
[01:47:38.020 --> 01:47:43.260]  sport I go and let it take off a boom as that's how they do they just kind of
[01:47:43.260 --> 01:47:46.860]  water get the armored vehicles ready bringing the blackout
[01:47:46.860 --> 01:47:50.420]  for his boys in the water even more oh we love you oh yeah oh you're old out of

[01:48:21.540 --> 01:48:26.140]  pit we go because if they're doing I kept saying they're getting away with
[01:48:26.140 --> 01:48:29.500]  all this right now imagine what's coming next like TPP yeah it's super

[01:56:38.700 --> 01:56:45.540]  go ahead. Yes sir I'm a military veteran and I'm still active duty actually and I
[01:56:45.540 --> 01:56:50.020]  just can't believe they came out in the open and my question is is there a way
[01:56:50.020 --> 01:56:56.100]  we can change this RNC delegate rule that our vote does matter? Yes absolutely
[01:56:56.100 --> 01:57:01.700]  the RNC committee members that are on the rules committee and what is it 11 of
[01:57:01.700 --> 01:57:04.860]  them on there? In fact we just pull up the RNC rules committee I'm going from
[01:57:04.860 --> 01:57:10.580]  memory they are the ones that claim they those few people men and women they
[01:57:10.580 --> 01:57:14.580]  vote for all Republicans so your vote doesn't count you heard the arrogance
[01:57:14.580 --> 01:57:18.900]  because it's the rule they made so he's God it's okay because he's the boss well
[01:57:18.900 --> 01:57:23.340]  I mean you know Obama could sign an executive order that he's allowed to you
[01:57:23.340 --> 01:57:27.260]  know chop puppy dogs heads off on the White House lawn it's not right you
[01:57:27.260 --> 01:57:32.220]  can't do that it's called tyranny and so you've got this this this this kook you
[01:57:32.220 --> 01:57:39.820]  know up there senior GOP official Curly Hewland or Holland H-A-U-G-L-A-N-D just
[01:57:39.820 --> 01:57:43.860]  on the news going yeah no well your votes don't count and this is normal so
[01:57:43.860 --> 01:57:48.100]  yes he and others need to have people absolutely tell them listen scumbag who
[01:57:48.100 --> 01:57:54.460]  do you work for? Exactly and then also like how could this guy Bernie get free
[01:57:54.460 --> 01:57:59.180]  college tuition to students when these military members have to sacrifice their
[01:57:59.180 --> 01:58:04.420]  lives and get shot up and blown up in order to for us to receive our free
[01:58:04.420 --> 01:58:07.860]  college and of course it isn't really free only part of it is look now I'm
[01:58:07.860 --> 01:58:11.620]  already saying I didn't say free for everybody I meant to state colleges
[01:58:11.620 --> 01:58:16.500]  state state which is still saying free education which will bankrupt but he
[01:58:16.500 --> 01:58:19.820]  doesn't really say that he says the first few years are free and then all they
[01:58:19.820 --> 01:58:23.500]  do is jack up the price on the end so it's kind of telling a mouse the first
[01:58:23.500 --> 01:58:28.820]  bite of cheese on the mouse trap is free but once you press the lever we break

[02:00:30.060 --> 02:00:34.460]  pronounce it, who is on the Republican Rules Committee and there's a bunch of
[02:00:34.460 --> 02:00:38.380]  committees but there's 29 on that committee. We found that number so it's
[02:00:38.380 --> 02:00:43.100]  these 29 people they whoever appointed them whoever they were bought and paid
[02:00:43.100 --> 02:00:48.260]  for whoever on the RNC I guess the main RNC appoints them the main committee
[02:00:48.260 --> 02:00:53.140]  then they decide who votes in America so I guess they should be running for
[02:00:53.140 --> 02:00:56.220]  office then and all that would be voting. I guess they just kind of elect
[02:00:56.220 --> 02:01:00.380]  themselves. There shall be an executive committee of the Republican National
[02:01:00.380 --> 02:01:04.060]  Committee to consist of 29 ringwraiths I mean officers and members of the

[02:02:21.900 --> 02:02:26.060]  because I actually talked to a couple of delegates yesterday who said that
[02:02:26.060 --> 02:02:31.340]  curly actually doesn't stand on that position as far as you know that he
[02:02:31.340 --> 02:02:34.900]  supports that now I don't you know I don't know him personally so I don't
[02:02:34.900 --> 02:02:38.700]  know if that's for sure but I will say there's just choice of words in the way
[02:02:38.700 --> 02:02:46.100]  that he chose to come off I agree I agree he is not a scumbag if he said that he
[02:02:46.100 --> 02:02:49.500]  was wrong or was taken out of context or whatever but the issue is he should come
[02:02:49.500 --> 02:02:53.100]  out and say it's wrong we're forcing a debate by the delegates and super
[02:02:53.100 --> 02:02:56.900]  delegates right now or managing delegates in the Republican Party so that
[02:02:56.900 --> 02:03:00.140]  they know it's not going to be put up with I think the answer is put pressure
[02:03:00.140 --> 02:03:04.740]  on these people right and I was you know like that's the thing I said to them is
[02:03:04.740 --> 02:03:08.220]  when they think I was very angry about it but you know this is they're stealing
[02:03:08.220 --> 02:03:11.780]  this promise they're taking the election from us and for someone to come out and
[02:03:11.780 --> 02:03:16.340]  be so brazen and act like hey it's cool to you know that the people don't have a
[02:03:16.340 --> 02:03:19.620]  choice here it's up to the party to choose this I said if he doesn't stand
[02:03:19.620 --> 02:03:23.220]  for that well then he should have stood up and said that have the fortitude to
[02:03:23.220 --> 02:03:27.500]  get up and say hey I don't believe in the way that should be instead he let them
[02:03:27.500 --> 02:03:32.140]  run this around and here I mean I would imagine today he's you know sick but I
[02:03:32.140 --> 02:03:35.500]  mean he may not get to stay on the committee if he criticizes it see how
[02:03:35.500 --> 02:03:39.820]  that works and another thing I want to put this out there when I came up here
[02:03:39.820 --> 02:03:43.780]  I've been living here six years I'm from Texas I've been living here in North
[02:03:43.780 --> 02:03:47.940]  Dakota for six years I had to find out to become a delegate here it's not a
[02:03:47.940 --> 02:03:51.140]  free election let me explain this to you when I had to when I had to come up here
[02:03:51.140 --> 02:03:54.340]  to go vote I thought well hey you know we'll just go vote it's a you know
[02:03:54.340 --> 02:03:58.060]  primary yada yada yada well no that's not the way it is you have to be
[02:03:58.060 --> 02:04:05.100]  approved by your by your district chair okay first before you pay $122 for
[02:04:05.100 --> 02:04:09.540]  your seat to become a delegate just so you can go vote and those dealt those
[02:04:09.540 --> 02:04:14.100]  seats are coming they're far and few and in between to be able to get and I was
[02:04:14.100 --> 02:04:20.940]  lucky and that's only one level of the RNC and DNC gatekeepers as you go up
[02:04:20.940 --> 02:04:26.300]  right it's ridiculous I mean it they and when I was called to by the head of my
[02:04:26.300 --> 02:04:30.300]  district chair he said they're gonna pick 22 delegates or 20 delegates I'm
[02:04:30.300 --> 02:04:35.500]  sorry from here to go to the the national convention and are you currently one
[02:04:35.500 --> 02:04:38.940]  of those delegates that's been picked are you one of the general delegates no
[02:04:38.940 --> 02:04:42.660]  I'm just gonna be a general delegate I think what they from what I what I was
[02:04:42.660 --> 02:04:45.980]  explained is the people who are gonna be picked to go to that are gonna be like
[02:04:45.980 --> 02:04:49.420]  the governor you know people that are basically super delegates people they
[02:04:49.420 --> 02:04:53.220]  know are absolutely gonna do their job see but we're not evil like they are
[02:04:53.220 --> 02:04:57.220]  what if we had sleeper cell people that lied and said they steal it but didn't at
[02:04:57.220 --> 02:05:01.500]  a time hey there how's it going Joe Biggs with info wars calm we got a

[02:05:15.900 --> 02:05:19.460]  one of the reasons why I am voting for Donald Trump now to watch the

[02:07:09.660 --> 02:07:15.980]  a defense 60 years ago when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs
[02:07:15.980 --> 02:07:21.460]  they had drums of their own air raid sirens but in the 21st century there
[02:07:21.460 --> 02:07:25.940]  are silent weapons for quiet war pathogens added to the food and water

[02:08:36.540 --> 02:08:41.140]  vice-trump Ian joins us we've got loaded phone calls with people that want to
[02:08:41.140 --> 02:08:44.060]  talk about what they think of the mainstream media saying they're gonna
[02:08:44.060 --> 02:08:49.020]  steal the nomination from Trump something we warned you of six seven months
[02:08:49.020 --> 02:08:54.220]  ago now it's in the Washington Post now it's everywhere they're admitting it
[02:08:54.220 --> 02:09:00.340]  they've got members of the RNC rules committee on CNBC on Fox going listen
[02:09:00.340 --> 02:09:04.140]  media stop lying it's always been this way your popular vote doesn't matter and
[02:09:04.140 --> 02:09:08.740]  the the host on CNBC says well then why do we even have primaries and he says
[02:09:08.740 --> 02:09:20.100]  good point good point we played that four times already curly Holland I mean
[02:09:20.100 --> 02:09:23.780]  that is just crazy to see this type of behavior from these people so they've
[02:09:23.780 --> 02:09:28.700]  got to mainline it now they've got to just legitimize it it's like Nambla you
[02:09:28.700 --> 02:09:32.460]  know trying to legitimize child molestation they just want to legitimize
[02:09:32.460 --> 02:09:38.260]  stealing elections in front of everyone it's it rises to that level of
[02:09:38.260 --> 02:09:44.340]  absurdity and surrealism it's worse than any grand faloon thought of in the
[02:09:44.340 --> 02:09:50.700]  great mind of Kurt Vonnegut and it makes the head spin but it's an elite so
[02:09:50.700 --> 02:09:56.100]  ingratiated with themselves so arrogant so disconnected they've tried
[02:09:56.100 --> 02:09:59.020]  everything they can they all the demonization all the lies about Trump
[02:09:59.020 --> 02:10:01.860]  it hasn't worked all them ganging up it blows up in their face it's a
[02:10:01.860 --> 02:10:06.340]  referendum on the fact that they are universally hated the Democrats are so
[02:10:06.340 --> 02:10:10.300]  pathetic that they stole it from Sanders in front of everybody right through
[02:10:10.300 --> 02:10:14.980]  state after state their people have kind of submitted some of them want to
[02:10:14.980 --> 02:10:17.780]  support Trump so they're doing this whole bait and switch where Hillary sends
[02:10:17.780 --> 02:10:26.460]  the Sanders foils in stone exposed that with us a week ago now it's been
[02:10:26.460 --> 02:10:29.340]  confirmed to be accurate he first exposed all these secret meetings and the
[02:10:29.340 --> 02:10:34.060]  Koch brothers coming on against them the Rothschilds the House of Saud the
[02:10:34.060 --> 02:10:38.060]  British government the Chinese Communist government the Pope the whole
[02:10:38.060 --> 02:10:41.500]  world the economists has come out and said oh no and they always had lines
[02:10:41.500 --> 02:10:45.220]  about fascism and Trump and the Christian science monitor the whole world
[02:10:45.220 --> 02:10:51.900]  is in fear of Donald Trump thank goodness that they're going to not let the
[02:10:51.900 --> 02:10:58.060]  popular vote stand that's how you fight fascism so we've now reached this
[02:10:58.060 --> 02:11:01.820]  incredible point now I just set the table here he's always gotten more inside
[02:11:01.820 --> 02:11:06.460]  baseball for us always more breaking news so we're going to recap what's
[02:11:06.460 --> 02:11:10.860]  happened flesh out the latest secret meetings his story that he offered us
[02:11:10.860 --> 02:11:14.060]  yesterday he said he could be run many places we say like to run it
[02:11:14.060 --> 02:11:19.620]  info wars dot com is now on drudge report dot com how the GOP elite plan to
[02:11:19.620 --> 02:11:24.140]  rob Donald Trump a play-by-play but a lot of you can't read while you're
[02:11:24.140 --> 02:11:28.020]  driving or things like that so we're gonna have spoken word here for you as we
[02:11:28.020 --> 02:11:32.980]  go through this and more with Roger Stone Roger thank you for coming on with
[02:11:32.980 --> 02:11:38.380]  us and I like that hat yeah this hat it was a gift from st. John Hunt who of
[02:11:38.380 --> 02:11:43.140]  course is the son of the legendary CIA operative and later Watergate burglar
[02:11:43.140 --> 02:11:47.580]  and the hat once belonged to eHoward Hunt so the mission impossible characters
[02:11:47.580 --> 02:11:54.420]  named after yes exactly so I wear this as a homage to my friend st. John you
[02:11:54.420 --> 02:11:59.100]  know this article today that appears exclusively on info wars dot com and was
[02:11:59.100 --> 02:12:05.180]  picked up by drudge and now I believe by real clear politics is a blow-by-blow of
[02:12:05.180 --> 02:12:10.060]  exactly how the king makers and the Republican bosses plan to steal the
[02:12:10.060 --> 02:12:15.660]  nomination from Donald Trump despite the the national will despite the fact that
[02:12:15.660 --> 02:12:21.700]  he has historically run the table in the primaries and most of the caucuses I've
[02:12:21.700 --> 02:12:26.580]  never seen anything like it since the hijacking of the Republican Party by the
[02:12:26.580 --> 02:12:34.420]  by the Eastern establishment in the 40s and in 1952 so to be very clear they
[02:12:34.420 --> 02:12:40.140]  have a number of gambits here that they intend to use curly Holland who is the
[02:12:40.140 --> 02:12:45.940]  Republican National Committee man from North Dakota has kind of inadvertently
[02:12:45.940 --> 02:12:50.860]  spilled the beans they're going to try to unbind all of these delegates so the
[02:12:50.860 --> 02:12:54.700]  argument quite simply is it doesn't matter how the people back in South
[02:12:54.700 --> 02:12:59.300]  Carolina voted or the people in New Hampshire voted the the delegates are
[02:12:59.300 --> 02:13:04.500]  all free agents that way those who are quizlings those who have been
[02:13:04.500 --> 02:13:10.580]  inserted into the delegations posing as Trump supporters can vote against Trump
[02:13:10.580 --> 02:13:14.660]  and other Trump supporters can be pressured they can be pressured by those
[02:13:14.660 --> 02:13:19.580]  who hold the map mortgage to their homes or to their businesses or to whom they
[02:13:19.580 --> 02:13:24.940]  own money this is going to be a slugfest in Cleveland this is gonna be a day
[02:13:24.940 --> 02:13:29.420]  long remembered undoubtedly I know you told me some of the inside baseball but
[02:13:29.420 --> 02:13:34.220]  obviously Trump is concerned about this I think the strategy is he needs to come
[02:13:34.220 --> 02:13:37.340]  out now the public is aware of this you don't want to sound like sour grapes
[02:13:37.340 --> 02:13:41.060]  before and say listen I'm the leader they're openly bragging about stealing
[02:13:41.060 --> 02:13:45.020]  it this is criminal you can't just change rules you know to say child
[02:13:45.020 --> 02:13:49.780]  molestation is okay and you can't change rules to steal the popular vote you know
[02:13:49.780 --> 02:13:53.220]  I'm considering a lawsuit or something like that I mean I know you're advising
[02:13:53.220 --> 02:13:57.460]  in what do you think of that advice well lawsuit would have no no force the
[02:13:57.460 --> 02:14:01.380]  Republican National Convention is not governed by federal or state law it's
[02:14:01.380 --> 02:14:05.460]  governed by its own rules that's actually what I mean I understand that
[02:14:05.460 --> 02:14:08.780]  there's got to be some pressure because it reaches the level of racketeering to
[02:14:08.780 --> 02:14:12.540]  say we're gonna ignore your popular vote through false advertising holding out
[02:14:12.540 --> 02:14:16.580]  that the election is about a popular vote well but the good news here Alex is
[02:14:16.580 --> 02:14:22.060]  Donald Trump is not in any way without cards he has many cards first of all he
[02:14:22.060 --> 02:14:26.020]  has the option of challenging the seating of some delegates the Texas
[02:14:26.020 --> 02:14:30.140]  delegation in my opinion could be challenged on the basis of widespread
[02:14:30.140 --> 02:14:35.300]  voter fraud that you here at info wars.com have helped us document the
[02:14:35.300 --> 02:14:41.780]  entire Ohio result is flawed because that ballot set up was tainted it was
[02:14:41.780 --> 02:14:47.380]  wired against Donald Trump now the lawyers tell me that Trump who was the
[02:14:47.380 --> 02:14:51.420]  only one withstanding would have a very strong lawsuit but instead of bringing a
[02:14:51.420 --> 02:14:56.820]  lawsuit he can bring his case to the to the credentials committee or to the
[02:14:56.820 --> 02:15:02.580]  full convention if it's necessary there they're also let's remember as the
[02:15:02.580 --> 02:15:08.180]  candidate who is closest to 1237 the magic number that one needs on the first
[02:15:08.180 --> 02:15:13.740]  ballot Donald Trump still has the vice presidential nomination to bestow on
[02:15:13.740 --> 02:15:20.020]  someone and it could be anyone anyone who controls a small but significant and
[02:15:20.020 --> 02:15:23.700]  that's how they forced in 1980 George Herbert Walker Bush in but he could come
[02:15:23.700 --> 02:15:28.060]  back through the same door but bring a patriot in let's expand on that imagine
[02:15:28.060 --> 02:15:33.980]  Trump up there during the RNC with his speech saying I have the majority the
[02:15:33.980 --> 02:15:37.940]  vast majority don't let them steal this delegates let's stand up and
[02:15:37.940 --> 02:15:42.580]  restore the Republic people would go crazy they'd be crying they would revolt
[02:15:42.580 --> 02:15:47.180]  against the party leadership it'd be the magic moment well plus I don't rule out
[02:15:47.180 --> 02:15:51.020]  the fact that there is some other constitutionalist out there in the
[02:15:51.020 --> 02:15:55.340]  Republican Party who would be a good vice president and controls a small but
[02:15:55.340 --> 02:16:00.540]  significant group of delegates just through personal loyalty so let's not
[02:16:00.540 --> 02:16:05.180]  let's not assume that just because the bosses and the kingmakers want to steal
[02:16:05.180 --> 02:16:09.620]  this that they are going to be successful Trump has the most important
[02:16:09.620 --> 02:16:14.660]  power on his side public opinion and as Abraham Lincoln said public opinion in
[02:16:14.660 --> 02:16:20.500]  this country is everything the big steal is going to be very difficult for the
[02:16:20.500 --> 02:16:26.300]  bosses to carry out it's interesting to me and I predict again George W. Bush's
[02:16:26.300 --> 02:16:31.060]  clan particularly Jeb Bush will be endorsing Ted Cruz shortly because Ted
[02:16:31.060 --> 02:16:36.180]  Cruz is a Bush family retainer Ted Cruz isn't the constitutional conservative
[02:16:36.180 --> 02:16:42.020]  you think he is he's a globalist he's backed by Goldman Sachs his wife and he
[02:16:42.020 --> 02:16:48.340]  are our minor servants for the Bush family she worked for Condoleezza Rice
[02:16:48.340 --> 02:16:52.060]  getting us into the phony Iraq war then she went over and worked for Robert
[02:16:52.060 --> 02:16:55.980]  Zellick the US trade representative former president of the World Bank
[02:16:55.980 --> 02:16:58.980]  former president of the council on foreign relations and now the fellow
[02:16:58.980 --> 02:17:05.340]  reserves giving money to him and Hillary but none zero to Donald Trump
[02:17:05.340 --> 02:17:10.780]  another incredible endorsement yeah he's Dr. Evil look if you asked me Donald
[02:17:10.780 --> 02:17:15.300]  Trump has a long list of thank-you notes that he has to write he's got to send
[02:17:15.300 --> 02:17:19.620]  one to the Pope he's got to send one to the Chinese government he's got to send
[02:17:19.620 --> 02:17:24.420]  one to Vincent Fox he's got to send one to Mitt Romney now he's got to send one
[02:17:24.420 --> 02:17:29.420]  to the Washington Post all of these attacks are backfiring all they're
[02:17:29.420 --> 02:17:34.980]  doing is winning votes for Donald Trump and for the first time in my political
[02:17:34.980 --> 02:17:40.620]  experience the massive negative advertising the torrent that the drum
[02:17:40.620 --> 02:17:45.900]  beat of negative advertising is having no effect voters are seeing it and it's
[02:17:45.900 --> 02:17:50.620]  moving them towards Trump because they see it as dirty pool they see it as an
[02:17:50.620 --> 02:17:55.060]  attempt to distract them and then above all of course it's time for Trump to
[02:17:55.060 --> 02:17:59.500]  write a nice fat thank-you letter to George Soros because blaming Bernie
[02:17:59.500 --> 02:18:04.180]  Sanders supporters for the protests that Trump rallies is like blaming the
[02:18:04.180 --> 02:18:09.100]  communists for the Reichstag fire this isn't a Bernie operation this is
[02:18:09.100 --> 02:18:15.300]  Soros and David Brock and Jonathan Lewis and a Clinton operation poor Bernie
[02:18:15.300 --> 02:18:20.700]  he's just an innocent bystander these are these are protesters masquerading as
[02:18:20.700 --> 02:18:25.100]  Bernie Sanders supporters but Alex here's the most stunning thing today a
[02:18:25.100 --> 02:18:30.300]  poll shows one third of Bernie Sanders supporters will not vote for Hillary
[02:18:30.300 --> 02:18:34.780]  Clinton and those voters I think because they're against NAFTA because they're
[02:18:34.780 --> 02:18:39.060]  against these international trade deals I think they end up with Trump and that
[02:18:39.060 --> 02:18:43.740]  is what scares the Jesus out of the Soros crowd this is incredible I've
[02:18:43.740 --> 02:18:47.700]  never heard or seen anything like this in US politics we're live on the air
[02:18:47.700 --> 02:18:52.620]  right now and I want you though because I want to take a clip of this post it in
[02:18:52.620 --> 02:18:57.700]  the drudge article it's linked put it on Facebook Twitter make it go viral and
[02:18:57.700 --> 02:18:59.820]  then I want to get to some other subjects after that but I want to start over
[02:18:59.820 --> 02:19:03.580]  with you and have you just encapsulate how big it is that the Republicans are
[02:19:03.580 --> 02:19:06.900]  openly saying all this why they're being so naked about it were they
[02:19:06.900 --> 02:19:10.740]  attempting to soft sell it has it backfired so I'm just gonna start back
[02:19:10.740 --> 02:19:14.220]  over and in just like three four minutes try to encapsulate it all so I
[02:19:14.220 --> 02:19:17.540]  can send out kind of a super video to everybody so let's do it right now live
[02:19:17.540 --> 02:19:22.300]  Roger Stone consummate Trump insider former head of his campaign you first
[02:19:22.300 --> 02:19:26.020]  warned six seven months ago on my show about the plan for a broker convention
[02:19:26.020 --> 02:19:30.020]  now they're in the Washington Post now they're on CNBC now they've got high
[02:19:30.020 --> 02:19:33.740]  level Republicans on the RNC on the rules committee saying yes your popular
[02:19:33.740 --> 02:19:38.340]  vote it's a quote that will play to get in a moment doesn't matter and forget
[02:19:38.340 --> 02:19:43.220]  even having primaries we're just going to decide who the nominee is in fact it
[02:19:43.220 --> 02:19:49.500]  may be Paul Ryan with zero delegates unprecedented Roger Stone you first
[02:19:49.500 --> 02:19:52.900]  warned of this I know you've been talking to Trump recently he's concerned
[02:19:52.900 --> 02:19:57.300]  explain this to us and where this is going and how we fight back against it
[02:19:57.300 --> 02:20:02.260]  sure the fact that Donald Trump may have 1237 votes the majority and the first
[02:20:02.260 --> 02:20:07.020]  ballot is almost irrelevant to the king makers to the party elites look they're
[02:20:07.020 --> 02:20:12.500]  petrified and here's why Trump is uncontrollable to them he's not
[02:20:12.500 --> 02:20:17.260]  susceptible to special interest pressure he is not he doesn't owe anybody
[02:20:17.260 --> 02:20:21.860]  there's no chips that can be called on him he's his own man and the only people
[02:20:21.860 --> 02:20:26.100]  he he owes at this point are the very voters who have propelled him to a
[02:20:26.100 --> 02:20:32.100]  commanding position in this contest so they will pull out all the stops they
[02:20:32.100 --> 02:20:37.220]  will try to unbind all delegates on the first ballot as the North Dakota
[02:20:37.220 --> 02:20:42.820]  Republican National Committee man Curly Howard has already publicly proclaimed
[02:20:42.820 --> 02:20:47.340]  secondarily they will try to throw out the delegates of any states where
[02:20:47.340 --> 02:20:51.580]  non-Republicans were allowed to vote even if it is consistent with state law so
[02:20:51.580 --> 02:20:55.540]  if independents and Democrats were allowed to vote and then they flooded
[02:20:55.540 --> 02:20:59.540]  the polls for Donald Trump which by the way as a positive sign for the
[02:20:59.540 --> 02:21:03.860]  Republican Party they will seek to throw those delegates out even in Texas
[02:21:03.860 --> 02:21:10.540]  today even though Trump has one delegates the the Rick Perry George P. Bush
[02:21:10.540 --> 02:21:17.820]  Ted Cruz combine is refusing to fill those slots with actual Trump supporters
[02:21:17.820 --> 02:21:22.420]  that way they would control those votes on any early procedural maneuvers
[02:21:22.420 --> 02:21:27.620]  remember Trump is not without cards he could knock out the entire Texas
[02:21:27.620 --> 02:21:32.100]  delegation on the basis of widespread voter fraud which by the way it's
[02:21:32.100 --> 02:21:37.580]  exactly how Eisenhower overturned the nomination of Robert Taft in 1952 by
[02:21:37.580 --> 02:21:41.860]  unseating the Texas delegates because the caucuses that had elected them were
[02:21:41.860 --> 02:21:46.060]  improperly conducted and Eisenhower voters were turned away that's right
[02:21:46.060 --> 02:21:50.460]  and info wars was the tip of the spear exposing that now the state board of
[02:21:50.460 --> 02:21:54.860]  elections is saying there's major evidence of fraud so is Ohio everything
[02:21:54.860 --> 02:21:58.200]  that you called through the organization that you've developed to monitor this
[02:21:58.200 --> 02:22:02.540]  fraud briefly tell us about that sure I'm working with the Trump ballot
[02:22:02.540 --> 02:22:07.940]  security project we are systematically building the case to take before the
[02:22:07.940 --> 02:22:12.300]  credentials committee to challenge the seating of various delegates currently
[02:22:12.300 --> 02:22:16.940]  pledged to Ted Cruz that we believe were fraudulently elected and by the way
[02:22:16.940 --> 02:22:20.940]  you're not playing games you helped honcho one of the top guys the recount
[02:22:20.940 --> 02:22:25.820]  in Florida that was successful for Bush yes and that's between unfortunately me
[02:22:25.820 --> 02:22:30.420]  and my god I will have to atone for that when I meet my maker I was doing my
[02:22:30.420 --> 02:22:35.860]  party duty and Frank in all honesty until I researched my book on the murder of
[02:22:35.860 --> 02:22:39.300]  John Kennedy and the involvement of Lyndon Baines Johnson although I
[02:22:39.300 --> 02:22:45.060]  disliked the bushes for their lack of any ideology or philosophy I never really
[02:22:45.060 --> 02:22:48.940]  realized how corrupt and evil they were sure and I wasn't bringing that up to
[02:22:48.940 --> 02:22:52.820]  zing you I'm just saying you are a top guy that comes in they're in contested
[02:22:52.820 --> 02:22:56.180]  elections and you're on the job and there's massive evidence of it look at
[02:22:56.180 --> 02:23:00.620]  how they stole those states from Bernie Sanders that's the other wild card how
[02:23:00.620 --> 02:23:04.540]  do Sanders people coming over to Trump a lot of them say they will how does that
[02:23:04.540 --> 02:23:09.980]  affect things well I actually think that's what that's why these phony Trojan
[02:23:09.980 --> 02:23:15.220]  horse protesters are being sent to the Trump demonstrations these are these are
[02:23:15.220 --> 02:23:19.180]  not Bernie Sanders supporters their people being given Bernie Sanders t-shirts
[02:23:19.180 --> 02:23:25.980]  it's a false flag the whole thing is a kabuki dance and here's why they
[02:23:25.980 --> 02:23:30.060]  understand put aside Bernie's hard left supporters because they will never vote
[02:23:30.060 --> 02:23:34.500]  for Trump but those Sanders supporters who are economic supporters who feel
[02:23:34.500 --> 02:23:39.740]  cheated by NAFTA and by TPP and by the globalist international trade deals that
[02:23:39.740 --> 02:23:43.420]  have sucked all the jobs out of America they're afraid that those voters are
[02:23:43.420 --> 02:23:47.100]  going to end up with Trump which is the logical place for them to go so now
[02:23:47.100 --> 02:23:51.940]  they're trying to stigmatize Trump he's a racist he's a bigot he's mentally
[02:23:51.940 --> 02:23:56.540]  unbalanced simply because he challenges the status quo and he is the only
[02:23:56.540 --> 02:24:00.820]  nationalist running in this race in a field of global he was against the Iraq
[02:24:00.820 --> 02:24:04.100]  war the Libya the Syria thing seems like one of the only sane people out there
[02:24:04.100 --> 02:24:08.140]  doesn't want to have war with Russia let's play this clip of one of the RNC
[02:24:08.140 --> 02:24:12.740]  rules committee heads just an incredible clip that's going viral everywhere
[02:24:12.740 --> 02:24:17.460]  in fours.com drudgereport.com stonezone.com if you want to see the
[02:24:17.460 --> 02:24:22.580]  full clip we're going to play about 60 seconds of it simply amazing we're
[02:24:22.580 --> 02:24:28.460]  senior GOP official Curly Hogland quote we choose the nominee not the voters and
[02:24:28.460 --> 02:24:32.980]  then she says it's this todo moment when the curtains pulled back so why even have
[02:24:32.980 --> 02:24:38.220]  primaries and he goes that's a good point why even vote I mean are we North
[02:24:38.220 --> 02:24:42.780]  Korea or are we the United States of America are we a republic or are we a
[02:24:42.780 --> 02:24:47.340]  oligarchy I mean the scales are coming off the eyes here's the clip Roger don't
[02:24:47.340 --> 02:24:50.740]  think that's the case once it's it you know if it would just be understood we
[02:24:50.740 --> 02:24:55.700]  have a problem with the media unfortunately the cable network I don't
[02:24:55.700 --> 02:24:58.540]  think this is a problem with the media I've heard from a lot of voters who say
[02:24:58.540 --> 02:25:02.300]  if they feel like their votes got stolen that they would be very unhappy and very
[02:25:02.300 --> 02:25:04.820]  angry I think you're looking at a different situation I realize these
[02:25:04.820 --> 02:25:08.020]  have been the rules but the last time these rules were put in place was 1976
[02:25:08.020 --> 02:25:12.660]  it's been a long time since then and they're still there yeah that's a problem
[02:25:12.660 --> 02:25:17.460]  the the the media has created the perception that the voters will decide
[02:25:17.460 --> 02:25:21.540]  the nomination and that's the content that's the conflict here we live in a
[02:25:21.540 --> 02:25:24.740]  democratic society what you're telling me is it's not a democratic society and
[02:25:24.740 --> 02:25:27.860]  your votes don't necessarily matter because it's a democratic representation
[02:25:27.860 --> 02:25:31.340]  correct no that's not what I'm trying to tell you what I'm trying to say is that
[02:25:31.340 --> 02:25:34.940]  there's a we're just one of the political parties there's many political
[02:25:34.940 --> 02:25:38.300]  parties the political parties choose their nominee not the general public
[02:25:38.300 --> 02:25:43.860]  contrary to popular belief and why they're holding the primaries that's a
[02:25:43.860 --> 02:25:49.820]  very good question that's a very good question so they've they've reached this
[02:25:49.820 --> 02:25:54.180]  magic moment where they're out in the open they're trying to sell the idea that
[02:25:54.180 --> 02:25:57.620]  they can change rules and ignore the popular vote the Democrats are doing it
[02:25:57.620 --> 02:26:03.060]  as well with Sanders and the Republican leadership's obviously side of the
[02:26:03.060 --> 02:26:05.980]  Democrats they don't care if they blow the party up that's all part of the plan
[02:26:05.980 --> 02:26:11.580]  but will they be able to survive the public's anger and will they be able to
[02:26:11.580 --> 02:26:17.260]  bully the super delegates into going along with this mr. Stone well look it's
[02:26:17.260 --> 02:26:21.020]  not over till it's over there's a substantial number of veterans of the
[02:26:21.020 --> 02:26:25.580]  Reagan 76 campaign veterans of the Ron Paul Wars veterans even of the Gold
[02:26:25.580 --> 02:26:29.380]  Water campaign who are going to be rallying do not assume that Donald
[02:26:29.380 --> 02:26:32.820]  Trump will be outmaneuvered at this convention because we aren't going to let
[02:26:32.820 --> 02:26:37.860]  that happen and Trump as someone this close to the nomination is not without
[02:26:37.860 --> 02:26:42.300]  cards or maneuvers and he can outmaneuver the kingmakers but what you
[02:26:42.300 --> 02:26:47.500]  just heard there was the arrogance of the ruling elite what he doesn't seem to
[02:26:47.500 --> 02:26:52.820]  understand is the voters elect delegates who go to a party convention to
[02:26:52.820 --> 02:26:57.180]  select the nominee the delegates other than the super delegates are not
[02:26:57.180 --> 02:27:02.180]  selected by the party bosses they are selected by the people and they have
[02:27:02.180 --> 02:27:07.260]  every intention of abrogating the votes of the people to allow this decision to
[02:27:07.260 --> 02:27:13.140]  be made by a small ruling clique right now somewhere Mitt Romney is in the bullpen
[02:27:13.140 --> 02:27:19.180]  with his makeup on ready for his emergence as the compromise you called
[02:27:19.180 --> 02:27:23.340]  it before he started halfway getting in and then said he wouldn't but you've
[02:27:23.340 --> 02:27:26.940]  also talked about Paul Ryan Boehner trying to draft him is there any truth
[02:27:26.940 --> 02:27:31.100]  for that well I think he's an acceptable option look last week as you
[02:27:31.100 --> 02:27:35.260]  probably saw he announced that under no circumstances would he be a candidate
[02:27:35.260 --> 02:27:38.900]  that tells me that he has every intention of being a candidate that's
[02:27:38.900 --> 02:27:44.060]  how American politics works in American politics no always means yes if you
[02:27:44.060 --> 02:27:47.740]  don't want to be vice president pardon me if you want to be vice president
[02:27:47.740 --> 02:27:51.100]  immediately announced that under no circumstances will you take the vice
[02:27:51.100 --> 02:27:56.220]  presidency you saw that from John Kasich this week PS he would take the vice
[02:27:56.220 --> 02:28:01.340]  presidency from Donald Trump tomorrow in a heartbeat personally it's just my
[02:28:01.340 --> 02:28:04.780]  opinion I don't think Trump is going to offer it to him I don't think Trump
[02:28:04.780 --> 02:28:09.460]  wants him I think Trump is very unsettled by his support for Common Core and
[02:28:09.460 --> 02:28:14.860]  his embrace of Obamacare that's another question let me ask you this and his
[02:28:14.860 --> 02:28:18.700]  support for nothing who do you think Trump's looking at for VP there's no
[02:28:18.700 --> 02:28:22.580]  way of saying other than to say because he's a businessman and I know how
[02:28:22.580 --> 02:28:26.540]  business people think all options are on the table until he's ready to make a
[02:28:26.540 --> 02:28:30.500]  decision he's going into a convention in which you have a number of people who
[02:28:30.500 --> 02:28:34.820]  would like to be vice president I do think that he is going to pick somebody
[02:28:34.820 --> 02:28:39.780]  whose views are entirely consistent with his own senator sessions that would
[02:28:39.780 --> 02:28:42.900]  help him in the south but he's already got the south I think he's already strong
[02:28:42.900 --> 02:28:46.580]  in the south I would I would hope that he will look for someone outside the realm
[02:28:46.580 --> 02:28:51.140]  of career politicians someone who's a true leader someone would stature
[02:28:51.140 --> 02:28:55.100]  perhaps somebody with a military background what about the word of some
[02:28:55.100 --> 02:29:00.300]  people saying Cruz I just don't I don't see that happening and here's why
[02:29:00.300 --> 02:29:04.820]  Trump has totally lost any confidence in Ted Cruz's ability to tell the truth

[02:33:16.380 --> 02:33:22.260]  years been politically active for 25 and my dad would take me on Ronald Reagan
[02:33:22.260 --> 02:33:28.980]  speeches when I was like six years old but I've been active for 25 years and I
[02:33:28.980 --> 02:33:36.580]  have never seen anything as surreal as what is going on right now I mean it's
[02:33:36.580 --> 02:33:41.860]  crazy to just have them on the news going and in the wash the post yeah we
[02:33:41.860 --> 02:33:45.300]  were gonna we're not gonna give him the nomination even to me gets however many
[02:33:45.300 --> 02:33:52.060]  and it just doesn't matter we're not gonna do it and it's where unstoppable
[02:33:52.060 --> 02:33:58.020]  hubris and arrogance and hutzpah and bravada meets the will of the people it's
[02:33:58.020 --> 02:34:03.740]  the immovable object or meets the unstoppable force it's scary how
[02:34:03.740 --> 02:34:09.980]  arrogant these weirdos are and how hypocritical they are so I want to ask
[02:34:09.980 --> 02:34:15.860]  Roger Stone the consummate Trump insider has he ever in and all the nine
[02:34:15.860 --> 02:34:22.580]  campaigns inside the White House of what three or four seen anything like this
[02:34:22.580 --> 02:34:26.620]  and why has it gotten to this point is it a sign of weakness in the political
[02:34:26.620 --> 02:34:33.060]  elite or a sign of strength or a sign of weakness and just delusion because the
[02:34:33.060 --> 02:34:38.180]  amount of people they're waking up now is truly unprecedented and then after he
[02:34:38.180 --> 02:34:42.660]  leaves us I appreciate folks that are patiently holding we're gonna go to
[02:34:42.660 --> 02:34:46.060]  everybody that's been holding like crystal and others for quite a while
[02:34:46.060 --> 02:34:52.620]  but Roger Stone is is our guest on this whole subject so so Roger specifically
[02:34:52.620 --> 02:34:55.940]  on that front what are what do you think of this time we're in what do you think
[02:34:55.940 --> 02:34:59.220]  of other stunts are they can pull and then other big tidbits because you've
[02:34:59.220 --> 02:35:03.460]  always got a lot of you know stuff cooking a lot of what's next info
[02:35:03.460 --> 02:35:07.580]  everything you've told us for six months a week later a month later exactly what
[02:35:07.580 --> 02:35:12.300]  you say comes out in the news after the the denials they do first saying you're
[02:35:12.300 --> 02:35:16.260]  a liar and I'm a liar and Matt drudges a liar and Breitbart's a liar and you
[02:35:16.260 --> 02:35:20.180]  know you've you said the Sun came up this morning you're a liar but you just
[02:35:20.180 --> 02:35:24.140]  continue to have the inside scoop on what's happening so other key points
[02:35:24.140 --> 02:35:28.300]  sir thanks for the time well Alex I think what's happened here is the
[02:35:28.300 --> 02:35:32.500]  establishment has been caught asleep in other words I think they underestimated
[02:35:32.500 --> 02:35:37.540]  the rage in the country over 30 years of failed policies and the American people
[02:35:37.540 --> 02:35:42.740]  have woken up to the fact that whether it is Bush or Clinton or Bush or Obama
[02:35:42.740 --> 02:35:48.780]  everything remains the same the country is in decline the the fiscal policies of
[02:35:48.780 --> 02:35:54.220]  the both parties have left us broke the immigration policies of both parties have
[02:35:54.220 --> 02:35:58.820]  left our streets unsafe our neighborhoods unsafe the trade policies have left us
[02:35:58.820 --> 02:36:04.100]  without jobs the the foreign policy has been costly in terms of blood and
[02:36:04.100 --> 02:36:09.460]  treasure but it's seemingly completely incoherent or we're trying to help our
[02:36:09.460 --> 02:36:13.660]  enemies and punish our friends that's a possibility too and I think they
[02:36:13.660 --> 02:36:17.540]  completely underestimated the fact that the people are completely fed up and
[02:36:17.540 --> 02:36:22.660]  that Donald Trump has ended up as the manifestation of that so early on they
[02:36:22.660 --> 02:36:27.620]  laughed him off he's not really gonna run this is just a burnishing his brand
[02:36:27.620 --> 02:36:31.380]  this is a publicity stunt and then when he got in the race they said he'll never
[02:36:31.380 --> 02:36:36.860]  reveal his finances he'll never file the necessary legally required financial
[02:36:36.860 --> 02:36:41.100]  disclosures of course he did those on time it was Jeb Bush who had to keep
[02:36:41.100 --> 02:36:45.900]  filing for extensions because he had to hide all of the shady deals with Carlos
[02:36:45.900 --> 02:36:50.220]  Slim and the other shady business endeavors that made him a rich man and
[02:36:50.220 --> 02:36:53.780]  then they said he's gonna fall flat on his face in these debates he's not a
[02:36:53.780 --> 02:36:57.460]  polished political performer he's gonna be terrible and that'll be the end of
[02:36:57.460 --> 02:37:02.580]  him of course he's pretty much dominated every debate and gone up after every
[02:37:02.580 --> 02:37:06.940]  debate in the polls and then they said well he has a ceiling so many people
[02:37:06.940 --> 02:37:11.380]  dislike him he can never transcend that ceiling which is only in the high 20s
[02:37:11.380 --> 02:37:15.460]  well in some states he's inched up like in Missouri this week he came this close
[02:37:15.460 --> 02:37:21.340]  to 50% so they have underestimated him just by the way as the party regulars
[02:37:21.340 --> 02:37:25.820]  in the establishment underestimated Barry Goldwater now that we're in the
[02:37:25.820 --> 02:37:29.780]  final innings and he is this close to winning the nomination what we have is
[02:37:29.780 --> 02:37:36.860]  hysteria he's a Nazi he's a bigot he's a hater he's fomenting violence he's
[02:37:36.860 --> 02:37:41.780]  mentally unbalanced he will push the nuclear button it's all the same things
[02:37:41.780 --> 02:37:48.660]  they said falsely about Barry Goldwater and their lies now but there are those
[02:37:48.660 --> 02:37:52.980]  in the Republican Party who don't care whether these would ultimately hurt the
[02:37:52.980 --> 02:37:57.620]  party's general election nominee because certain Republicans almost all of whom
[02:37:57.620 --> 02:38:02.860]  wear a second hat as a lobbyist they would rather have Hillary and Bill
[02:38:02.860 --> 02:38:06.940]  Clinton back in there having a Republican Senate and a Republican house
[02:38:06.940 --> 02:38:11.700]  because it's easy to play let's make a deal with the Clintons they're crony
[02:38:11.700 --> 02:38:14.340]  capital sure let me bring up this wildcard and we're gonna let you go
[02:38:14.340 --> 02:38:18.260]  because this is from CNN conservative leaders gathered a plot against Donald
[02:38:18.260 --> 02:38:24.340]  Trump another meeting this time to run a third party candidate that's more
[02:38:24.340 --> 02:38:27.940]  conservative obviously not to win but to undercut because they don't take votes
[02:38:27.940 --> 02:38:32.540]  from Hillary I mean they're openly plotting to give it to Hillary I mean
[02:38:32.540 --> 02:38:38.620]  these people are true scallywags in in every sense they have no honor but
[02:38:38.620 --> 02:38:43.020]  they're so insulated in their own lawyer bubbles like you said it caught a
[02:38:43.020 --> 02:38:46.580]  sleep at the switch that they still think they can steal this and that brings
[02:38:46.580 --> 02:38:51.220]  me to my next question after this it's a two-parter the push for civil unrest by
[02:38:51.220 --> 02:38:55.460]  the left Black Lives Matters all that being activated Trump saying civil
[02:38:55.460 --> 02:38:58.660]  unrest coming if they steal the election from him comment on those two points
[02:38:58.660 --> 02:39:03.980]  sir well first of all as I'm very proud to say that three years ago I was
[02:39:03.980 --> 02:39:08.220]  deeply involved in the successful effort to get the libertarian party candidate
[02:39:08.220 --> 02:39:14.020]  Gary Johnson on the ballot in 48 states and frankly we qualified in 50 but we
[02:39:14.020 --> 02:39:19.380]  were screwed by political judicial decisions in Oklahoma and Michigan he
[02:39:19.380 --> 02:39:24.100]  certainly qualified in every state wait until the bosses find how hard it is to
[02:39:24.100 --> 02:39:28.860]  get on the ballot in all 50 states as an independent because there is no
[02:39:28.860 --> 02:39:34.020]  available party and libertarians are not going to nominate some non-libertarian
[02:39:34.020 --> 02:39:39.460]  that's not going to happen so I see that as an idle boast as an exercise in
[02:39:39.460 --> 02:39:43.980]  futility you're going to see these mass protests they're going to try to make
[02:39:43.980 --> 02:39:51.300]  Cleveland this summer Chicago 1968 and by the way the Chicago demonstrations
[02:39:51.300 --> 02:39:56.100]  against Humphrey redounded to the benefit of Richard Nixon frankly they're
[02:39:56.100 --> 02:40:00.420]  going to overreach if Donald Trump handles these demonstrations properly
[02:40:00.420 --> 02:40:05.340]  they're going to help elect him as have the attacks from the Chinese government
[02:40:05.340 --> 02:40:09.700]  the Pope the Mexicans and all these other entities that have attacked Trump
[02:40:09.700 --> 02:40:15.140]  have only been jujitsu'd by Trump and he has benefited from them look for more
[02:40:15.140 --> 02:40:19.820]  of that all right Roger thank you so much for the time and thank you for

[02:46:12.740 --> 02:46:18.460]  level delegate you're in the same state as this RNC rules committee chairman
[02:46:18.460 --> 02:46:23.060]  who's just saying forget the popular vote what is that like for you to see
[02:46:23.060 --> 02:46:26.460]  that and hear that on television so nakedly and other points you'd like to
[02:46:26.460 --> 02:46:30.740]  make. Well I mean you know like I said before I'm
[02:46:30.740 --> 02:46:36.060]  disgusted by the tone in which you know in the guile that he had to say that and
[02:46:36.060 --> 02:46:41.060]  then not stand up if he doesn't support that he should have said that he doesn't
[02:46:41.060 --> 02:46:45.060]  support it's very nonchalant it's very nonchalant I mean has he said that he
[02:46:45.060 --> 02:46:49.300]  doesn't support what he said yet? Yeah and last and no I haven't heard and like
[02:46:49.300 --> 02:46:53.340]  I said I'm gonna go to the convention and I'm gonna go to him and tell him hey

[02:47:15.180 --> 02:47:18.420]  family here these are the kinds of things that are going to cause social
[02:47:18.420 --> 02:47:22.060]  insurrection it's gonna cause these play this place to explode I mean it's not
[02:47:22.060 --> 02:47:25.140]  helped like the views on something terrible happened. And it really what
[02:47:25.140 --> 02:47:29.700]  about the disconnected shows that they would openly be on TV and the news
[02:47:29.700 --> 02:47:35.180]  selling this these weird creepy men and women up there that have
[02:47:35.180 --> 02:47:39.820]  stolen the country. They're a bunch of sick of fans just like you describe it Alex I mean

[02:55:32.380 --> 02:55:36.580]  is a civilization that's falling and when it completely falls it's road warrior
[02:55:36.580 --> 02:55:41.780]  folks you can see it coming you can feel it in your gut this place is a time bomb
[02:55:41.780 --> 02:55:47.340]  let's play the surreal clip homeowner was alerted of the break-in by her
[02:55:47.340 --> 02:55:52.260]  security system with officers already on their way she rushed home to check things
[02:55:52.260 --> 02:55:57.860]  out and police say she was armed she observed a subject exiting the home
[02:55:57.860 --> 02:56:02.060]  through the rear according to detectives there was a confrontation and one shot
[02:56:02.060 --> 02:56:06.740]  was fired Johnson was pronounced dead at the hospital it was wrong she did not
[02:56:06.740 --> 02:56:09.620]  have to shoot him it's no reason that she should have waited and so after he
[02:56:09.620 --> 02:56:13.820]  walked out the yard it's already there why would she shoot him relatives say
[02:56:13.820 --> 02:56:17.140]  they don't believe Johnson stole anything from the home but detectives
[02:56:17.140 --> 02:56:20.020]  would not confirm that you have to understand you have to look at it from
[02:56:20.020 --> 02:56:23.780]  every arm child's point of view that was raised in the hood how he gonna get his
[02:56:23.780 --> 02:56:28.220]  his money to have clothes to go to school and how's he gonna get the
[02:56:28.220 --> 02:56:32.700]  thousand-dollar a tooth gold caps
[02:56:33.460 --> 02:56:36.940]  I've always had great teeth never really had any cabbage or problems but I
[02:56:36.940 --> 02:56:39.420]  finally from clenching my teeth at night have one of my big molars to
[02:56:39.420 --> 02:56:43.140]  centigrade last year and I went and got the molar my dad's retired now and to
[02:56:43.140 --> 02:56:47.700]  get just a porcelain molar was about a thousand dollars and they said you could
[02:56:47.700 --> 02:56:53.980]  have gold too it's only 1200 oh so you got to have each tooth like a gold grill
[02:56:53.980 --> 02:56:58.620]  and then and then and then this lady they're not saying racism because it
[02:56:58.620 --> 02:57:01.380]  looks like a black neighborhood bet money it was a black lady defending
[02:57:01.380 --> 02:57:05.380]  herself because you know it'd been a new Trayvon Martin thing and it had been a
[02:57:05.380 --> 02:57:11.980]  cracker ass I actually do love that term I mean this is the idiocy of what's
[02:57:11.980 --> 02:57:17.060]  going on in this country and it's what dependency creates and I see these UT
[02:57:17.060 --> 02:57:20.540]  students or a race color and creed milling around they want everything free
[02:57:20.540 --> 02:57:26.700]  from Bernie Sanders I witness it every day what dependency creates that's
[02:57:26.700 --> 02:57:30.020]  very very sad William thanks for the plug earlier but but I'll get into your
[02:57:30.020 --> 02:57:34.700]  subject the Republicans this speaking of thugs you get shot for breaking in
[02:57:34.700 --> 02:57:39.060]  somebody's house but what happens when you steal the whole country I guess they
[02:57:39.060 --> 02:57:45.100]  make you king William yeah that's completely outrageous but I'm on topic
[02:57:45.100 --> 02:57:49.460]  of what why I originally called you know everyone's taking their masks off you
[02:57:49.460 --> 02:57:54.820]  know I mean the DNC they're ripping up the Communist Bernie Sanders the RNC you
[02:57:54.820 --> 02:57:59.820]  know all of us Ron Paulers knew that they were corrupt several years ago
[02:57:59.820 --> 02:58:03.980]  they've probably been corrupt for longer than I was even aware but with Trump
[02:58:03.980 --> 02:58:09.260]  there's even more people and it's just becoming obvious so like the RNC's
[02:58:09.260 --> 02:58:13.980]  taking off the mask the socialist protesters carrying communist flags are
[02:58:13.980 --> 02:58:17.180]  taking off the mask it's just the time where everyone's taking off the mask
[02:58:17.180 --> 02:58:21.820]  the shills like you know blend back and the crews are being exposed I mean
[02:58:21.820 --> 02:58:26.180]  it's just it's just that time and I'll say Sean Hannity again did a good job he
[02:58:26.180 --> 02:58:29.420]  said he'll leave the Republican Party if they steal the election from Trump so
[02:58:29.420 --> 02:58:33.580]  we're gonna find out who's who the men from the boys I hear absolutely great
[02:58:33.580 --> 02:58:37.260]  point we'll be right back with a couple more phone calls Chris and others

[03:00:00.820 --> 03:00:02.820]  Look at this headline.
[03:00:03.820 --> 03:00:06.820]  Chinese Communist government calls Trump racist clown.
[03:00:06.820 --> 03:00:15.820]  It's 1159 Radio Free America and this is Uncle Sam with music and the truth until dawn right now I got a few words for some of our brothers and sisters in the occupied zone.
[03:00:15.820 --> 03:00:17.820]  The chair is against the wall.
[03:00:17.820 --> 03:00:19.820]  The chair is against the wall.
[03:00:19.820 --> 03:00:21.820]  John has a long mustache.
[03:00:21.820 --> 03:00:23.820]  John has a long mustache.
[03:00:23.820 --> 03:00:26.820]  It's 12 o'clock American another day closer to victory.
[03:00:26.820 --> 03:00:31.820]  And for all of you out there on or behind the line this is your song.
[03:00:31.820 --> 03:00:36.820]  We're actually occupied now they want to physically finish the job.
[03:00:36.820 --> 03:00:37.820]  They're taking over the banks.
[03:00:37.820 --> 03:00:38.820]  A lot of people away.
[03:00:38.820 --> 03:00:40.820]  People that they thought were going to make trouble for them.
[03:00:40.820 --> 03:00:44.820]  People that had guns or things they wanted they just took them away.
[03:00:44.820 --> 03:00:45.820]  Where?
[03:00:45.820 --> 03:00:46.820]  Re-education camps.
[03:00:46.820 --> 03:00:47.820]  And they just take.
[03:00:47.820 --> 03:00:55.820]  So part of the reason we have to break through are kind of the private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[03:00:55.820 --> 03:01:01.820]  I have decided we really need camps for adults.
[03:01:01.820 --> 03:01:06.820]  And we need to have camps that you all run.
[03:01:06.820 --> 03:01:07.820]  I mean really.
[03:01:07.820 --> 03:01:10.820]  All persons of Japanese descent were required to register.
[03:01:10.820 --> 03:01:16.820]  Now they were taken to race tracks and fairgrounds where the army almost overnight had built assembly centers.
[03:01:16.820 --> 03:01:17.820]  Come on I'm a SARS citizen.
[03:01:17.820 --> 03:01:19.820]  I refuse to recognize you guys.
[03:01:19.820 --> 03:01:22.820]  What kind of a situation in the US would you see that happening?
[03:01:22.820 --> 03:01:27.820]  I mean we've got a lot of Constitution lists and a lot of people that it's not filed with.
[03:01:27.820 --> 03:01:36.820]  Plus you have a lot of people that are coming out of the military that have the ability and the knowledge to build IEDs and to defeat law enforcement techniques.
[03:01:36.820 --> 03:01:42.820]  These people are radicalized and they don't support the United States and they're disloyal.
[03:01:42.820 --> 03:01:43.820]  And now we're not allowed to vote.
[03:01:43.820 --> 03:01:50.820]  It's our right and our obligation to segregate them from the normal community.
[03:01:50.820 --> 03:01:54.820]  You know what comes after not letting you vote is killing your election.
[03:01:54.820 --> 03:01:57.820]  It's what we're doing here unless not kidding by it.
[03:01:57.820 --> 03:02:01.820]  We're building a domestic army because the government is afraid of its own citizens.
[03:02:01.820 --> 03:02:05.820]  And I hope the normal tribes police and other men walked into a trap.
[03:02:05.820 --> 03:02:10.820]  Rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[03:02:10.820 --> 03:02:12.820]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:02:12.820 --> 03:02:15.820]  Are you some kind of a constitutionalist?
[03:02:15.820 --> 03:02:18.820]  Yeah, where you get to vote, you know, Constitution.
[03:02:18.820 --> 03:02:22.820]  You hold themselves out to be patriots or not.
[03:02:22.820 --> 03:02:25.820]  They're nothing more than domestic terrorists.
[03:02:25.820 --> 03:02:29.820]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:02:37.820 --> 03:02:45.820]  All right, I got time to take one call or so from Chris and then we've got Rob New coming up to post the violence of the transmission.
[03:02:45.820 --> 03:02:49.820]  Please don't take this broadcast for granted, whether you're listening to us on AM FM,
[03:02:49.820 --> 03:02:53.820]  watching us on UHF, VHF TV, cable systems around the country starting to pick us up.
[03:02:53.820 --> 03:02:56.820]  I want to thank all those affiliates.
[03:02:56.820 --> 03:02:57.820]  This isn't a game.
[03:02:57.820 --> 03:02:58.820]  This isn't my perspective.
[03:02:58.820 --> 03:02:59.820]  It's not my view.
[03:02:59.820 --> 03:03:01.820]  This is what's going on.
[03:03:01.820 --> 03:03:04.820]  The Communist Chinese government, the biggest murderers in history,
[03:03:04.820 --> 03:03:08.820]  84 million of their own people came out and said you better not elect Trump two weeks ago.
[03:03:08.820 --> 03:03:12.820]  Now state run media has come out to info wars.com story.
[03:03:12.820 --> 03:03:18.820]  Steve Watson, Communist Chinese government calls Trump racist clown.
[03:03:18.820 --> 03:03:20.820]  Compares him to Hitler.
[03:03:20.820 --> 03:03:24.820]  State media uses Trump to declare that democracy is dangerous.
[03:03:24.820 --> 03:03:32.820]  See, the state run Communist Chinese media has attacked GOP front runner, calling him racist, directly comparing him to Adolf Hitler.
[03:03:32.820 --> 03:03:39.820]  In an editorial, the Global Times newspaper, the billionaire candidate is described as a big mouth and abusively forthright.
[03:03:39.820 --> 03:03:44.820]  The piece declares that Trump at first was acting as a clown to attract more voters to GOP,
[03:03:44.820 --> 03:03:50.820]  but warns that he has now opened a pair of Pandora's box in U.S. society.
[03:03:50.820 --> 03:03:55.820]  The piece argues that allowing citizens to democratically choose their own leaders is dangerous according to Trump.
[03:03:55.820 --> 03:03:59.820]  The rise of a racist in the U.S. political area worries the world.
[03:03:59.820 --> 03:04:01.820]  Notice how the Communist used the term racist.
[03:04:01.820 --> 03:04:06.820]  The editorial states that he has been called another Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler.
[03:04:06.820 --> 03:04:09.820]  This is from people that killed about five times what Hitler did.
[03:04:09.820 --> 03:04:10.820]  Very classic.
[03:04:10.820 --> 03:04:13.820]  Chris, you know, Chris, I'm out of time.
[03:04:13.820 --> 03:04:16.820]  Do will take your call. I apologize. I didn't look at the clock.
[03:04:16.820 --> 03:04:21.820]  So the headline is powerful, but it needs to be Communist Chinese attack Trump again.
[03:04:21.820 --> 03:04:25.820]  People think it's the one two weeks ago. I mean, this, this needs to be made a big deal.
[03:04:25.820 --> 03:04:27.820]  Greatest mass murders in history.
[03:04:27.820 --> 03:04:29.820]  Criticize Trump.
[03:04:29.820 --> 03:04:34.820]  I mean, how could you not support him now?
[03:04:34.820 --> 03:04:36.820]  Come on, folks.
[03:04:36.820 --> 03:04:41.820]  People ask me a small group, but, you know, they kind of have moral authority.
[03:04:41.820 --> 03:04:46.820]  They're like, Trump's a big scam. You know, you're really making a mistake supporting him.
[03:04:46.820 --> 03:04:49.820]  I've always committed generally.
[03:04:49.820 --> 03:04:51.820]  I mean, I don't look for something that's perfect.
[03:04:51.820 --> 03:04:53.820]  I stick my neck out. It's what I do.
[03:04:53.820 --> 03:05:04.820]  I'm not on the sidelines. I'm in the arena.
[03:05:24.820 --> 03:05:30.820]  They are sick and tired of these polished politicians, these everyday lying scumbags.
[03:05:30.820 --> 03:05:31.820]  They want something new.
[03:05:31.820 --> 03:05:34.820]  Hey, he might not be the greatest person ever, but guess what?
[03:05:34.820 --> 03:05:39.820]  We'll get four years of something different, not a continuation of the eight years we've had.
[03:05:39.820 --> 03:05:41.820]  That's what you're going to get with Hillary Clinton.
[03:05:41.820 --> 03:05:44.820]  Four more years of the Obama administration, but worse.
[03:05:44.820 --> 03:05:46.820]  So be smart when you go out there.
[03:05:46.820 --> 03:05:50.820]  Understand that the GOP is trying to do everything they can to save their jobs,
[03:05:50.820 --> 03:05:54.820]  to keep this guy from being in the White House because they want to keep their power.
[03:05:54.820 --> 03:05:56.820]  Stay tuned for more reports at infowars.com.

[03:08:35.820 --> 03:08:37.820]  Alright, we are back with the fourth hour. I'm your host, Rob Dew.
[03:08:37.820 --> 03:08:39.820]  Happy St. Patrick's Day to everyone.
[03:08:39.820 --> 03:08:42.820]  I'm, of course, decked out in plenty of green,
[03:08:42.820 --> 03:08:47.820]  which, incidentally, is not the real color of St. Patrick.
[03:08:47.820 --> 03:08:52.820]  I'm going to get to that in the other things you didn't know about St. Patrick in Ireland.
[03:08:52.820 --> 03:08:56.820]  Lots of interesting news there.
[03:08:56.820 --> 03:09:00.820]  And also, there is an amateur metal detector.
[03:09:00.820 --> 03:09:02.820]  I don't know if you've ever gone metal detecting. It's fun.
[03:09:02.820 --> 03:09:04.820]  I've found some really interesting stuff doing it.
[03:09:04.820 --> 03:09:10.820]  But here's a man found a cross dated back in the 900 AD.
[03:09:10.820 --> 03:09:15.820]  He found it in Denmark, and it's kind of turning the spread of Christianity on its head.
[03:09:15.820 --> 03:09:19.820]  St. Patrick is also responsible for the spread of Christianity.
[03:09:19.820 --> 03:09:20.820]  So, we're getting a little bit of that.
[03:09:20.820 --> 03:09:24.820]  I usually don't do a lot of religious news, but it is St. Patrick's Day, and I'm Irish.
[03:09:24.820 --> 03:09:28.820]  So, we're going to talk about, not all Irish, but partially Irish.
[03:09:28.820 --> 03:09:34.820]  Definitely, my grandfather was all, I think, 100% Irish.
[03:09:34.820 --> 03:09:38.820]  And we're going to get into some Jurassic Park news.
[03:09:38.820 --> 03:09:39.820]  It may be closer than you think.
[03:09:39.820 --> 03:09:42.820]  We had a billionaire clone, his dog, recently.
[03:09:42.820 --> 03:09:47.820]  And now, scientists think they're very close to cloning a T-Rex.
[03:09:47.820 --> 03:09:49.820]  Can't wait to see that.
[03:09:49.820 --> 03:09:51.820]  Maybe they'll use him as a real-life bio weapon.
[03:09:51.820 --> 03:09:54.820]  And we're also going to get into this Democratic Spring.
[03:09:54.820 --> 03:09:57.820]  If you've been listening to the show, you've heard Joe Biggs.
[03:09:57.820 --> 03:10:03.820]  It's a really funny take on what's going to be going on this spring, starting, I guess, April 2nd.
[03:10:03.820 --> 03:10:10.820]  They're going to kick it off the disgruntled millennials who are mad that capitalism hasn't given them enough gadgets to stare at,
[03:10:10.820 --> 03:10:15.820]  continuously, like iPhones and PlayStation 4s and all the other stuff.
[03:10:15.820 --> 03:10:20.820]  They like to spend their time with driverless cars, which are in the future.
[03:10:20.820 --> 03:10:23.820]  Lyft, Uber, all the great stuff that makes their lives easier.
[03:10:23.820 --> 03:10:25.820]  They're complaining about it.
[03:10:25.820 --> 03:10:30.820]  They want to go back and maybe live in something like a North Korea lifestyle.
[03:10:30.820 --> 03:10:31.820]  So, we'll get into that.
[03:10:31.820 --> 03:10:37.820]  But first, South by Southwest is in full, high gear right now, kicking it into Austin.
[03:10:37.820 --> 03:10:40.820]  And what does that bring aside from a ton of people?
[03:10:40.820 --> 03:10:45.820]  They just can't make enough money with the numbers of increased amounts of people that are here.
[03:10:45.820 --> 03:10:54.820]  So, they got to do stuff like charge you $80 to park your car, which we saw back, we saw this actually last week on Friday when the president showed up.
[03:10:54.820 --> 03:10:56.820]  So, let's go to that report from Jakari Jackson right now.
[03:10:56.820 --> 03:11:07.820]  This is Jakari Jackson reporting from Austin, Texas, here at South by Southwest.
[03:11:07.820 --> 03:11:10.820]  Have you heard about the city council trying to put the restrictions?
[03:11:10.820 --> 03:11:12.820]  I signed the petition, man.
[03:11:12.820 --> 03:11:13.820]  City council, can I say that?
[03:11:13.820 --> 03:11:15.820]  Yes, sir.
[03:11:15.820 --> 03:11:20.820]  And now we're here at South by Southwest where we have seen advertisements for parking as much as $80.
[03:11:20.820 --> 03:11:25.820]  So, we're going to ask the people who are out of town if the right sharing initiative would have affected them at all.
[03:11:25.820 --> 03:11:26.820]  Where are you guys from?
[03:11:26.820 --> 03:11:27.820]  Denmark.
[03:11:27.820 --> 03:11:28.820]  Denmark.
[03:11:28.820 --> 03:11:30.820]  How much are you guys playing to travel here in the city of Austin?
[03:11:30.820 --> 03:11:32.820]  Within the city of Austin?
[03:11:32.820 --> 03:11:33.820]  We're walking.
[03:11:33.820 --> 03:11:34.820]  Yeah, we're walking pretty much, yeah.
[03:11:34.820 --> 03:11:41.820]  From Sao Paulo, Brazil, I usually walk and take these free lift rides that they give away.
[03:11:41.820 --> 03:11:42.820]  Where did you come from?
[03:11:42.820 --> 03:11:43.820]  I'm here from Austin.
[03:11:43.820 --> 03:11:44.820]  Here from Austin.
[03:11:44.820 --> 03:11:45.820]  Did you drive down here?
[03:11:45.820 --> 03:11:46.820]  Yes.
[03:11:46.820 --> 03:11:47.820]  Okay, how much did it cost you to park?
[03:11:47.820 --> 03:11:48.820]  $0.
[03:11:48.820 --> 03:11:49.820]  $0.
[03:11:49.820 --> 03:11:50.820]  Where did you park?
[03:11:50.820 --> 03:11:51.820]  You tell me where you park.
[03:11:51.820 --> 03:11:52.820]  I know where to park.
[03:11:52.820 --> 03:11:54.820]  Enjoying yourself by experience?
[03:11:54.820 --> 03:11:55.820]  Yes, I am.
[03:11:55.820 --> 03:11:56.820]  Thank you.
[03:11:56.820 --> 03:11:57.820]  Where did you come from?
[03:11:57.820 --> 03:11:58.820]  I came from Australia.
[03:11:58.820 --> 03:11:59.820]  Australia?
[03:11:59.820 --> 03:12:00.820]  I definitely did.
[03:12:00.820 --> 03:12:01.820]  Drive.
[03:12:01.820 --> 03:12:02.820]  We're walking as much as possible.
[03:12:02.820 --> 03:12:05.820]  It's kind of a good opportunity to get some, you know, fitness going.
[03:12:05.820 --> 03:12:08.820]  But, yeah, Uber and Lyft as well if we need to.
[03:12:08.820 --> 03:12:09.820]  Do you work downtown?
[03:12:09.820 --> 03:12:11.820]  Yeah, I work downtown.
[03:12:11.820 --> 03:12:12.820]  Okay.
[03:12:12.820 --> 03:12:15.820]  So, we've seen some signs around here for parking as high as $80.
[03:12:15.820 --> 03:12:16.820]  $80?
[03:12:16.820 --> 03:12:17.820]  Yeah, that's crazy.
[03:12:17.820 --> 03:12:23.320]  I mean, I paid $30 the other day, $40, and then I just stopped driving and started taking
[03:12:23.320 --> 03:12:25.100]  the bus or an Uber, you know?
[03:12:25.100 --> 03:12:28.220]  A parking sign, a couple blocks over for $80 to park.
[03:12:28.220 --> 03:12:30.460]  So let's say on a normal Friday night, how much is parking?
[03:12:30.460 --> 03:12:31.460]  Do you guys pay attention?
[03:12:31.460 --> 03:12:36.060]  Typically, at those spots where it would be where it says $80, those spots are probably
[03:12:36.060 --> 03:12:39.540]  anywhere from like 10 to 20 on a typical night.
[03:12:39.540 --> 03:12:42.620]  But yeah, I know exactly what signs you're talking about.
[03:12:42.620 --> 03:12:46.660]  So, there you go, South by Screwjob.
[03:12:46.660 --> 03:12:51.380]  So, what's going on here in Austin and we're going to be playing more clips coming up.
[03:12:51.380 --> 03:12:55.260]  So I want to finish up with the call and actually our caller Chris from Indiana wants to talk
[03:12:55.260 --> 03:12:56.260]  about Ted Cruz.
[03:12:56.260 --> 03:12:58.260]  And I'll give out the number again, 800-259-9231.
[03:12:58.260 --> 03:13:02.540]  I'll be taking your calls throughout the rest of the fourth hour.
[03:13:02.540 --> 03:13:03.540]  Thank you for listening.
[03:13:03.540 --> 03:13:04.820]  This is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:13:04.820 --> 03:13:05.820]  I'm your host, Rob Do.
[03:13:05.820 --> 03:13:09.700]  And you can watch this if you're listening on radio, go to infowars.com forward slash
[03:13:09.700 --> 03:13:12.180]  show and watch the free video stream.
[03:13:12.180 --> 03:13:13.780]  And we also put this out on YouTube later.
[03:13:13.780 --> 03:13:15.380]  So thanks for watching and listening.
[03:13:15.380 --> 03:13:18.380]  Chris, in Indiana, go ahead with your call.
[03:13:18.380 --> 03:13:20.380]  Hey, Rob.
[03:13:20.380 --> 03:13:21.380]  Hi.
[03:13:21.380 --> 03:13:29.020]  Hey, as Confucius said, the famous Chinese philosopher, he said, signs and symbols rule
[03:13:29.020 --> 03:13:31.860]  the world, not rules and law.
[03:13:31.860 --> 03:13:39.100]  I got to tell you, not all masons are bad, you know, via Georgia, Washington, but you
[03:13:39.100 --> 03:13:46.820]  know, Ted Cruz, if you look at one of the bates from a couple months ago, he had this
[03:13:46.820 --> 03:13:50.980]  secret hand of the master of the second bail of Freemasonry.
[03:13:50.980 --> 03:13:55.060]  During the national anthem, he put his right hand inside of his...
[03:13:55.060 --> 03:13:56.820]  I knew exactly where you were going with this.
[03:13:56.820 --> 03:14:00.460]  I actually told the guys, I had him cut my mic and said, pull up those shots.
[03:14:00.460 --> 03:14:01.460]  Go ahead.
[03:14:01.460 --> 03:14:02.460]  Keep talking.
[03:14:02.460 --> 03:14:03.460]  Sure.
[03:14:03.460 --> 03:14:10.700]  I mean, people know about this Napoleon, but Napoleon did that in his thing, in his artistic
[03:14:10.700 --> 03:14:11.700]  work.
[03:14:11.700 --> 03:14:17.940]  Napoleon, Lenin, the Pope, the current Pope himself, Karl Marx, thousands of other pictures,
[03:14:17.940 --> 03:14:24.340]  even, you know, even George Washington did this, but I mean, this is an evil sign of
[03:14:24.340 --> 03:14:25.340]  Ted Cruz.
[03:14:25.340 --> 03:14:27.820]  I mean, why would you do that?
[03:14:27.820 --> 03:14:28.820]  Seriously.
[03:14:28.820 --> 03:14:30.740]  What's your opinion on that?
[03:14:30.740 --> 03:14:32.460]  Well, because he's...
[03:14:32.460 --> 03:14:38.580]  My opinion is that he's showing that he is a captured soul and he's ready to do whatever,
[03:14:38.580 --> 03:14:40.660]  whoever's controlling the masons.
[03:14:40.660 --> 03:14:42.280]  Or maybe he's just...
[03:14:42.280 --> 03:14:43.780]  Maybe his hand was cold.
[03:14:43.780 --> 03:14:44.780]  I don't know.
[03:14:44.780 --> 03:14:45.780]  What do you think?
[03:14:45.780 --> 03:14:46.780]  What does it actually mean?
[03:14:46.780 --> 03:14:50.660]  Does that mean your hand is closer to your heart or does that mean you're hiding something?
[03:14:50.660 --> 03:14:51.660]  It's the sign...
[03:14:51.660 --> 03:14:54.500]  No, look, Rob, it's an actual thing.
[03:14:54.500 --> 03:14:58.620]  It's the sign of the master of the second bail.
[03:14:58.620 --> 03:14:59.620]  Look it up.
[03:14:59.620 --> 03:15:04.460]  It's an actual thing of Freemasonry.
[03:15:04.460 --> 03:15:07.700]  Like, it's a, you know, it's a status.
[03:15:07.700 --> 03:15:10.780]  It's not like anything that's not on record.
[03:15:10.780 --> 03:15:11.780]  We have a...
[03:15:11.780 --> 03:15:12.780]  That is an actual...
[03:15:12.780 --> 03:15:13.780]  Oh, no, I believe you.
[03:15:13.780 --> 03:15:14.780]  I believe you.
[03:15:14.780 --> 03:15:15.780]  I know exactly...
[03:15:15.780 --> 03:15:18.660]  I mean, I don't know exactly what it means, but I know people show that to me and I knew
[03:15:18.660 --> 03:15:21.740]  that as a Mason symbol and I've seen other people do it.
[03:15:21.740 --> 03:15:26.580]  We have a weird clip when we were working on Obama Deception 2, which we never put out.
[03:15:26.580 --> 03:15:27.820]  But it was...
[03:15:27.820 --> 03:15:32.860]  It was Colin Powell going up and he was saying he was ninth level of the order of the bath
[03:15:32.860 --> 03:15:33.860]  or something.
[03:15:33.860 --> 03:15:38.140]  It was some crazy weird title that he'd given himself and he was getting really mad because
[03:15:38.140 --> 03:15:40.060]  the lady couldn't write it down correctly.
[03:15:40.060 --> 03:15:41.380]  She's like, I don't understand.
[03:15:41.380 --> 03:15:43.420]  He's like, listen to me.
[03:15:43.420 --> 03:15:47.420]  Maybe we'll play that sometime, but yeah, these people are definitely, and you know,
[03:15:47.420 --> 03:15:51.940]  anytime you go work with the Bushes, you got to be suspect at that point.
[03:15:51.940 --> 03:15:57.660]  And maybe it's because George and George W. are here in Texas, so he thinks he has to
[03:15:57.660 --> 03:15:59.660]  work with them to get his point across.
[03:15:59.660 --> 03:16:00.660]  Thanks for calling, Chris.
[03:16:00.660 --> 03:16:02.260]  Let's go to Todd in North Dakota.
[03:16:02.260 --> 03:16:08.180]  He says he knows Curly Hoglin from the RNC, who basically said, it doesn't matter if you
[03:16:08.180 --> 03:16:09.180]  vote.
[03:16:09.180 --> 03:16:13.380]  We choose who's going to be in, and what was it, Rince Priebus said, they're auditioning
[03:16:13.380 --> 03:16:15.020]  to join us, to join us.
[03:16:15.020 --> 03:16:20.700]  Now we got conservatives calling for a third party, which who knows who they would run
[03:16:20.700 --> 03:16:25.180]  at that point, but maybe going into the Libertarian Party and taking that over.
[03:16:25.180 --> 03:16:31.020]  Right now, I think Gary Johnson and John McAfee are two of the headliners vying for
[03:16:31.020 --> 03:16:32.100]  that nomination.
[03:16:32.100 --> 03:16:33.700]  So go ahead, Todd.
[03:16:33.700 --> 03:16:34.700]  What's Curly like?
[03:16:34.700 --> 03:16:35.700]  My call.
[03:16:35.700 --> 03:16:36.700]  Yeah.
[03:16:36.700 --> 03:16:37.700]  Am I on?
[03:16:37.700 --> 03:16:38.700]  Yeah.
[03:16:38.700 --> 03:16:39.700]  Go ahead.
[03:16:39.700 --> 03:16:40.700]  Okay.
[03:16:40.700 --> 03:16:41.700]  Yeah.
[03:16:41.700 --> 03:16:45.380]  A little spin there, Rob, but no, what Curly said is well known if you're involved with
[03:16:45.380 --> 03:16:46.380]  the party.
[03:16:46.380 --> 03:16:47.380]  It's nothing new.
[03:16:47.380 --> 03:16:53.220]  And I would just say that of all the people in that national level, he's, he's one of
[03:16:53.220 --> 03:16:54.220]  the better ones.
[03:16:54.220 --> 03:17:02.180]  So I take the, you can't let the media right out of this one that easy.
[03:17:02.180 --> 03:17:04.020]  This has been a rule for 40 years.
[03:17:04.020 --> 03:17:05.020]  Oh, sure.
[03:17:05.020 --> 03:17:06.020]  Sure.
[03:17:06.020 --> 03:17:07.020]  She's playing dumb.
[03:17:07.020 --> 03:17:10.020]  She's playing dumb, essentially the host, you think?
[03:17:10.020 --> 03:17:13.940]  Investigated to actually know that they see the delegates and then the delegates have
[03:17:13.940 --> 03:17:17.420]  to go to a convention and the delegates vote.
[03:17:17.420 --> 03:17:24.580]  I mean, so it's a saying that, you know, Curly is an evil guy because he just flat out said
[03:17:24.580 --> 03:17:25.580]  that's not how it works.
[03:17:25.580 --> 03:17:28.980]  So as the rules have been there for 40 years, I think people have to take in that word in
[03:17:28.980 --> 03:17:32.900]  the sense that the media is the one that's been buffooning everybody because if they
[03:17:32.900 --> 03:17:37.580]  don't have Super Tuesdays, you know, they, they lead people to believe that if you win
[03:17:37.580 --> 03:17:40.420]  X number of states, you're going to be the nomination.
[03:17:40.420 --> 03:17:41.420]  And that's the thing.
[03:17:41.420 --> 03:17:45.780]  When it's an establishment hero like George Bush or Mitt Romney or John McCain, you know,
[03:17:45.780 --> 03:17:46.780]  it's okay.
[03:17:46.780 --> 03:17:48.820]  It's just like, hey, that's, this is who's winning.
[03:17:48.820 --> 03:17:52.700]  You know, we had the process in the beginning and everybody danced around and acted and
[03:17:52.700 --> 03:17:54.020]  played their part.
[03:17:54.020 --> 03:17:56.740]  But now we have our guys, everybody else step back.
[03:17:56.740 --> 03:17:57.780]  But now we're not seeing that.
[03:17:57.780 --> 03:18:02.780]  We're seeing the, the establishment go crazy, which is why I don't understand why these
[03:18:02.780 --> 03:18:06.220]  younger kids, because we've been sending people out in the street, these younger kids that
[03:18:06.220 --> 03:18:10.420]  are going to South by, none of them seem to really like Donald Trump at all.
[03:18:10.420 --> 03:18:13.140]  They're either Bernie supporters or Hillary supporters.
[03:18:13.140 --> 03:18:14.460]  And I don't understand it.
[03:18:14.460 --> 03:18:17.940]  I guess they've been brainwashed enough to think that if you're in the Republican party,
[03:18:17.940 --> 03:18:20.100]  you're absolutely evil.
[03:18:20.100 --> 03:18:23.380]  And, and that Donald Trump is a racist, they, because they say the same thing.
[03:18:23.380 --> 03:18:24.380]  He's racist.
[03:18:24.380 --> 03:18:25.380]  He's unophobic.
[03:18:25.380 --> 03:18:26.860]  They say the same thing over and over again.
[03:18:26.860 --> 03:18:29.620]  So they, there's definitely some mind control going on there.
[03:18:29.620 --> 03:18:33.660]  Derek Green's got a report coming on about that subject coming out tonight.
[03:18:33.660 --> 03:18:35.780]  So Todd, anything else?
[03:18:35.780 --> 03:18:38.300]  Yeah, I agree with everything you just said.
[03:18:38.300 --> 03:18:42.180]  I was just, you know, hearing from college that are kind of saying that the media has
[03:18:42.180 --> 03:18:46.060]  no responsibility in this and I find that just ironic.
[03:18:46.060 --> 03:18:49.660]  No, they're not doing, they're not doing their job at all.
[03:18:49.660 --> 03:18:53.300]  One group of media people that is doing a job looks like the News4I team.
[03:18:53.300 --> 03:18:58.220]  They've got an article out, Secret Crimes, how the Department of State is classifying
[03:18:58.220 --> 03:19:01.500]  and covering up violent crimes committed in the US.
[03:19:01.500 --> 03:19:05.140]  And what they're doing is covering up crimes of diplomats who are coming in.
[03:19:05.140 --> 03:19:09.180]  So they've been fighting to get this information since 2008.
[03:19:09.180 --> 03:19:14.900]  They've uncovered an employee's working for Saudi Arabian Embassy had four times as many
[03:19:14.900 --> 03:19:20.380]  tickets for reckless driving DUI, a position to marijuana than any other country's embassy.
[03:19:20.380 --> 03:19:26.540]  And they received a list of 30 crimes between 2012 and 2014, including an Ethiopian diplomat
[03:19:26.540 --> 03:19:29.900]  who returned to his home county after being accused of assault with the intent to kill
[03:19:29.900 --> 03:19:31.420]  while armed.
[03:19:31.420 --> 03:19:35.700]  Another was being sent back to Equatorial Guinea, was being accused of malicious wounding while
[03:19:35.700 --> 03:19:40.740]  the diplomat from Morocco had to stand trial for robbery and purse snatching.
[03:19:40.740 --> 03:19:43.940]  And these are the people, and we're covering it up because we don't want any mud on our
[03:19:43.940 --> 03:19:44.940]  hands.
[03:19:44.940 --> 03:19:45.940]  We'll be back with more.
[03:19:45.940 --> 03:19:46.940]  It's the Fourth Hour of Overdrive.
[03:19:46.940 --> 03:19:47.940]  I'm your host Rob Duh.
[03:19:47.940 --> 03:19:48.940]  Thanks for watching.
[03:19:48.940 --> 03:19:49.940]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:19:49.940 --> 03:19:50.940]  Hi there.
[03:19:50.940 --> 03:20:01.780]  Are you an unhappy timeshare owner?
[03:20:01.780 --> 03:20:04.860]  Have you ever asked yourself, how can I get rid of my timeshare?
[03:20:04.860 --> 03:20:07.900]  Does your story go something like Stacy's story goes?
[03:20:07.900 --> 03:20:08.900]  Here's Stacy now.
[03:20:08.900 --> 03:20:14.980]  My husband and I went and visited a resort, and they kind of attacked us, and they kept
[03:20:14.980 --> 03:20:15.980]  sending more and more people.
[03:20:15.980 --> 03:20:19.500]  And so we finally said yes, and we bought this timeshare, and then we were stuck in this
[03:20:19.500 --> 03:20:22.420]  timeshare that we couldn't get rid of, and we tried all different ways.
[03:20:22.420 --> 03:20:25.180]  They made it seem like it was just a really great deal.
[03:20:25.180 --> 03:20:28.220]  And when we said no originally, then they brought the price down.
[03:20:28.220 --> 03:20:31.820]  And then when we still said no, they brought in the manager, and they brought the price
[03:20:31.820 --> 03:20:34.580]  down even lower, and they started breaking out in different ways to make it look like
[03:20:34.580 --> 03:20:36.020]  it was this really awesome deal.
[03:20:36.020 --> 03:20:38.220]  The reality was it wasn't an awesome deal at all.
[03:20:38.220 --> 03:20:41.580]  To cancel your timeshare contract, call ACC today.

[03:21:00.540 --> 03:21:03.900]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[03:21:03.900 --> 03:21:08.780]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance
[03:21:08.780 --> 03:21:11.260]  to organize and prepare a defense.
[03:21:11.260 --> 03:21:17.860]  60 years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums
[03:21:17.860 --> 03:21:20.380]  of their own, air raid sirens.
[03:21:20.380 --> 03:21:24.820]  But in the 21st century, there were silent weapons for quiet war.
[03:21:24.820 --> 03:21:29.340]  Pathogens added to the food and water, and to the lining of plastics that destroy our
[03:21:29.340 --> 03:21:34.380]  vitality, turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death.
[03:21:34.380 --> 03:21:37.780]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[03:21:37.780 --> 03:21:45.820]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation
[03:21:45.820 --> 03:21:49.060]  to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.

[03:21:56.900 --> 03:22:01.660]  with Anthroplex.

[03:22:09.020 --> 03:22:12.740]  A while back, a man called me who had had prostate cancer.
[03:22:12.740 --> 03:22:16.940]  He asked if I could beat a very high quote another life insurance agent had given him.
[03:22:16.940 --> 03:22:18.540]  I said, let me see.
[03:22:18.540 --> 03:22:23.340]  Well, I took his pertinent information, then shopped the highly rated, price competitive
[03:22:23.340 --> 03:22:28.500]  companies we represent, and found one who pre-approved him for a premium way below what
[03:22:28.500 --> 03:22:30.060]  he had been quoted.
[03:22:30.060 --> 03:22:35.300]  When it comes to term life insurance, no other company touches select quotes, experience,
[03:22:35.300 --> 03:22:42.100]  and expertise in finding the right policy at the right price for almost anyone.

[03:23:09.980 --> 03:23:15.020]  So why are you messing around with generic razors that cost 32 bucks per an 8-pack?

[03:24:10.460 --> 03:24:15.300]  Just got a tweet from Marcus Walker saying the hidden hand behind the scene, Ted Cruz
[03:24:15.300 --> 03:24:23.540]  hand in his coat, and that's interesting, people are talking about this, Ted Cruz hidden
[03:24:23.540 --> 03:24:27.540]  hand scenario, I'm your host Rob, this is the fourth hour, here's an article from the
[03:24:27.540 --> 03:24:28.540]  Daily Mail.
[03:24:28.540 --> 03:24:33.540]  Protesters stormed Brazilian capital after bugged phone call goes public, which reveals
[03:24:33.540 --> 03:24:38.460]  president gave a senior government position to her predecessor so he could avoid arrest
[03:24:38.460 --> 03:24:40.460]  over corruption.
[03:24:40.460 --> 03:24:44.540]  Protest have her up in the Brazilian capital, after a recorded phone call between president
[03:24:44.540 --> 03:24:48.900]  Dilma Rousseff and her once popular predecessor was released, suggesting that she appointed
[03:24:48.900 --> 03:24:55.060]  him to her cabinet to spare him from an arrest in corruption and caused an uproar in Congress
[03:24:55.060 --> 03:25:03.100]  with lawmakers is screaming, resign, resign, 2000 people gathered outside the capital in
[03:25:03.100 --> 03:25:09.180]  Brazil to demand she step down and that Lula step down and Rousseff leave office.
[03:25:09.180 --> 03:25:15.740]  So will we see the same type of stuff here if they steal the election from the nomination
[03:25:15.740 --> 03:25:16.740]  from Donald Trump?
[03:25:16.740 --> 03:25:21.820]  Three million Brazilians flooded the streets in a nationwide protest on Sunday calling
[03:25:21.820 --> 03:25:29.540]  for Rousseff's departure reminds me of a joke, George W. Bush joke, George W. is in the office
[03:25:29.540 --> 03:25:35.540]  and Dick Cheney came in and said, sir, we lost three Brazilian soldiers in Iraq today
[03:25:35.540 --> 03:25:40.060]  and George Bush jumps under the table and goes, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, Dick Cheney goes,
[03:25:40.060 --> 03:25:41.060]  what's wrong, George?
[03:25:41.060 --> 03:25:48.460]  He says, well, I don't know how many is a Brazilian, but no, it's not a comedy show
[03:25:48.460 --> 03:25:49.460]  people.
[03:25:49.460 --> 03:25:51.060]  This is the Alex Jones show.
[03:25:51.060 --> 03:25:52.060]  And where does this go?
[03:25:52.060 --> 03:25:56.500]  This goes to what's going on here in the United States, anti Trump groups threaten largest
[03:25:56.500 --> 03:26:02.180]  civil disobedience action of the century with little fanfare and almost no news media
[03:26:02.180 --> 03:26:03.180]  attention.
[03:26:03.180 --> 03:26:06.060]  Some of the same radical groups involved in shutting down Donald Trump's Chicago rally
[03:26:06.060 --> 03:26:10.900]  last week are plotting a mass civil disobedience movement to begin next month.
[03:26:10.900 --> 03:26:13.980]  These people don't want anti establishment, but yet they're going to go vote for Hillary.
[03:26:13.980 --> 03:26:16.780]  Who are these people going to vote for, for the presidential election, or maybe they're
[03:26:16.780 --> 03:26:17.940]  not going to vote for anybody.
[03:26:17.940 --> 03:26:18.940]  Maybe that's the point.
[03:26:18.940 --> 03:26:23.940]  They gave them Bernie Sanders as their sacrificial lamb to get them all stirred up and to think
[03:26:23.940 --> 03:26:28.980]  that they're going to get something for free from all the rich people.
[03:26:28.980 --> 03:26:32.460]  And even though these kids probably all live in air conditioned homes, a flat screen TVs,
[03:26:32.460 --> 03:26:39.340]  play stations, iPhones, all the goodness that modern society has to offer.
[03:26:39.340 --> 03:26:40.340]  So they're going to be doing this.
[03:26:40.340 --> 03:26:43.460]  And Mackie, who actually went out on the streets to talk to some people at South by Southwest
[03:26:43.460 --> 03:26:47.820]  to see if they're going to be planning to attend this mass protest and what they think
[03:26:47.820 --> 03:26:49.540]  about violent protest in general.
[03:26:49.540 --> 03:26:51.340]  So here's that report.
[03:26:51.340 --> 03:26:54.780]  What did you think about what happened at the Trump rally in Illinois?
[03:26:54.780 --> 03:26:59.740]  I think it was, I think it could have been handled a little differently.
[03:26:59.740 --> 03:27:00.740]  Humans are weird.
[03:27:00.740 --> 03:27:01.740]  We need help.
[03:27:01.740 --> 03:27:04.060]  Trump, he's going to die or something.
[03:27:04.060 --> 03:27:05.460]  He's not going to be president.
[03:27:05.460 --> 03:27:06.460]  I'm all for it.
[03:27:06.460 --> 03:27:07.460]  I'm all for it.
[03:27:07.460 --> 03:27:08.460]  Donald Trump.
[03:27:08.460 --> 03:27:10.900]  It looked like a lot of fun.
[03:27:10.900 --> 03:27:14.060]  I think it was a good deal.
[03:27:14.060 --> 03:27:20.300]  So like, do you think that was a violation of someone's free speech or it was offensive,
[03:27:20.300 --> 03:27:21.300]  so shut it down?
[03:27:21.300 --> 03:27:25.100]  I think the dude gets enough time to talk anyways.
[03:27:25.100 --> 03:27:29.060]  If you promote the energy of people like, well, like Sanders is trying to do, you know,
[03:27:29.060 --> 03:27:33.260]  he's trying to promote the people and I think a lot of people aren't respecting Trump for
[03:27:33.260 --> 03:27:36.420]  that reason, you know, because he's all about turning down people and breaking up a country
[03:27:36.420 --> 03:27:37.420]  and stuff like that.
[03:27:37.420 --> 03:27:43.700]  Well, this is actually breaking like right now, so one of the big groups that was behind
[03:27:43.700 --> 03:27:48.260]  organizing like that thousand of people to come, they're organizing the biggest protest
[03:27:48.260 --> 03:27:53.100]  of the century, like thousands of people are going to be walking for 10 days on the East
[03:27:53.100 --> 03:27:59.860]  Coast to like demand Congress either like bow to their demands, which is let the voters
[03:27:59.860 --> 03:28:04.580]  votes count, get rid of the billionaire class or get rid of Congress.
[03:28:04.580 --> 03:28:07.380]  Do you think that that's going to work?
[03:28:07.380 --> 03:28:08.380]  I think so.
[03:28:08.380 --> 03:28:09.580]  I think action speaks loudest.
[03:28:09.580 --> 03:28:13.380]  I think people walking and putting their feet into the dirt, I think that that makes
[03:28:13.380 --> 03:28:14.380]  the most sense.
[03:28:14.380 --> 03:28:15.380]  Will you be taking part?
[03:28:15.380 --> 03:28:19.460]  No, because it's not going to change anything.
[03:28:19.460 --> 03:28:24.100]  Money rules the world and it always will because humans are greedy people and hopefully
[03:28:24.100 --> 03:28:27.380]  it won't be like that one day, but that's just how it is for now.
[03:28:27.380 --> 03:28:29.420]  So you could change it.
[03:28:29.420 --> 03:28:31.020]  I am going to change it.
[03:28:31.020 --> 03:28:36.300]  But marching, it's a good way to start, but what I go, absolutely, I would go.
[03:28:36.300 --> 03:28:37.300]  Yes, I would.
[03:28:37.300 --> 03:28:38.300]  Yeah.
[03:28:38.300 --> 03:28:39.300]  What would you be?
[03:28:39.300 --> 03:28:43.020]  Would you be willing to risk getting arrested to go if this, if you thought this was going
[03:28:43.020 --> 03:28:44.020]  to?
[03:28:44.020 --> 03:28:48.460]  Well, sometimes, you know, again, being in the right place at the right time or the right
[03:28:48.460 --> 03:28:52.380]  place at the wrong time, you know, it could happen.
[03:28:52.380 --> 03:28:58.700]  Well, Bernie Sanders, Bernie Sanders, because he's going to futuristically change politics.
[03:28:58.700 --> 03:29:01.300]  Are you going to go to the largest protest of the century?
[03:29:01.300 --> 03:29:02.300]  10 day walk?
[03:29:02.300 --> 03:29:04.620]  I'm so testing right now.
[03:29:04.620 --> 03:29:06.340]  One rally ain't going to do nothing for it.
[03:29:06.340 --> 03:29:09.820]  Do you think violence is a new form of protest or?
[03:29:09.820 --> 03:29:11.380]  Yeah, I think it is.
[03:29:11.380 --> 03:29:12.940]  I mean, even I don't even think it's new.
[03:29:12.940 --> 03:29:15.500]  I mean, back in the 60s, you know, they used to do the same thing.
[03:29:15.500 --> 03:29:17.500]  I just think it's coming around again.
[03:29:17.500 --> 03:29:22.300]  Things can only go so far, you know, is that a pot can only boil over, you know, it's not
[03:29:22.300 --> 03:29:24.740]  going to settle down unless somebody takes the lid off.
[03:29:24.740 --> 03:29:28.380]  So I feel like, I mean, people got to be heard some way or another.
[03:29:28.380 --> 03:29:32.340]  I mean, look what happened in Chicago, you know, I wasn't all for it because I, like
[03:29:32.340 --> 03:29:34.340]  I said, I promote peace and positivity.
[03:29:34.340 --> 03:29:36.140]  But if that's what you got to do, you got to do that.
[03:29:36.140 --> 03:29:41.020]  Donald Trump, I don't feel he's a racist as well as I don't feel like African Americans
[03:29:41.020 --> 03:29:42.020]  are racist.
[03:29:42.020 --> 03:29:47.300]  I just think there's tension amongst our history and there's no one way to solve it.
[03:29:47.300 --> 03:29:48.300]  So worry about it.
[03:29:48.300 --> 03:29:49.300]  That's great.
[03:29:49.300 --> 03:29:50.300]  There is tension.
[03:29:50.300 --> 03:29:51.300]  The Empire's on the Overline.
[03:29:51.300 --> 03:29:52.300]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:52.300 --> 03:29:59.300]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:59.300 --> 03:30:02.300]  Hey kids, where you want to go on April 2nd?
[03:30:02.300 --> 03:30:03.300]  Whoa.
[03:30:03.300 --> 03:30:04.300]  Democracy Springs, me too.
[03:30:04.300 --> 03:30:05.300]  Hey there.
[03:30:05.300 --> 03:30:11.340]  This is Joe Biggs with infowars.com and I'm so excited for April 2nd because guess what's
[03:30:11.340 --> 03:30:12.340]  going on?
[03:30:12.340 --> 03:30:13.340]  Democracy Spring.
[03:30:13.340 --> 03:30:17.660]  It's going to be a large protest where a whole bunch of social justice warriors sit
[03:30:17.660 --> 03:30:22.420]  around and whine and cry and complain about democracy while raping your rights.
[03:30:22.420 --> 03:30:23.900]  Yeah, it'll be great.
[03:30:23.900 --> 03:30:25.900]  Get your fans, your family, everything.
[03:30:25.900 --> 03:30:26.900]  Get a bullhorn.
[03:30:26.900 --> 03:30:32.780]  Get a whole bunch of stupid signs made that make no sense at all and run around and bully
[03:30:32.780 --> 03:30:35.020]  people who want to disagree with you.
[03:30:35.020 --> 03:30:36.700]  It's going to be the greatest thing ever.
[03:30:36.700 --> 03:30:38.980]  Hey Donald Trump, you're a racist.
[03:30:38.980 --> 03:30:40.820]  We don't know why, but it's because you're white.
[03:30:40.820 --> 03:30:41.820]  You can't be here.
[03:30:41.820 --> 03:30:42.820]  You're triggering me.
[03:30:42.820 --> 03:30:44.820]  Get out of my safe space.
[03:30:44.820 --> 03:30:45.820]  Democracy Spring.
[03:30:45.820 --> 03:30:50.180]  It's going to be so much fun, I'll probably explode.

[03:32:07.020 --> 03:32:10.300]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.

[03:33:11.100 --> 03:33:16.860]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side.
[03:33:16.860 --> 03:33:19.060]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:33:19.060 --> 03:33:31.020]  I've got Chad in Kentucky, Brenda in Minnesota, Seal in Canada, Chase in Texas, and Dave
[03:33:31.020 --> 03:33:32.020]  in PA.
[03:33:32.020 --> 03:33:33.580]  I'm going to try to get to all your calls.
[03:33:33.580 --> 03:33:36.580]  Coming up, got a half an hour left of the fourth hour of overdrive.
[03:33:36.580 --> 03:33:37.580]  I'm your host Rob Dew.
[03:33:37.580 --> 03:33:39.700]  We've got a headline on Politico.
[03:33:39.700 --> 03:33:43.180]  Top conservatives gather to plot third party run against Trump.
[03:33:43.180 --> 03:33:47.180]  It seems the prophecies of Gerald Salente are coming to pass.
[03:33:47.180 --> 03:33:51.820]  Trump's forecaster said there will be a new third party and it's going to be a reaction
[03:33:51.820 --> 03:33:53.620]  to what's going on.
[03:33:53.620 --> 03:33:59.460]  He didn't call it that it would be a reaction to the system just pulling their hair out
[03:33:59.460 --> 03:34:04.100]  that the fact that Donald Trump looks like to be the eventual nominee of the Republican
[03:34:04.100 --> 03:34:06.940]  party and they don't like it.
[03:34:06.940 --> 03:34:13.100]  Anything the establishment is against, I'm kind of for and I've never been a big, I definitely
[03:34:13.100 --> 03:34:19.820]  like what Trump's doing and it's definitely good news and I love seeing the, what do they
[03:34:19.820 --> 03:34:24.180]  call it when you bring in a new technology, a disruptive technology.
[03:34:24.180 --> 03:34:28.740]  He's a disruptive political force and I like to see that because I think what's gone on
[03:34:28.740 --> 03:34:31.420]  with the status quo is gone on long enough.
[03:34:31.420 --> 03:34:33.100]  I'm done with it.
[03:34:33.100 --> 03:34:38.940]  People think you got Barack Obama in and that he was for the people, he wasn't for the people.
[03:34:38.940 --> 03:34:41.220]  He's killing little kids with drone strikes.
[03:34:41.220 --> 03:34:42.500]  He's taken over countries.
[03:34:42.500 --> 03:34:44.540]  Look at Libya, your socialist paradise.
[03:34:44.540 --> 03:34:47.740]  He destroyed it along with Hillary Clinton, okay?
[03:34:47.740 --> 03:34:51.260]  That's what's on their political tombstone, okay?
[03:34:51.260 --> 03:34:55.660]  Those are the things that is on, that's what they've been involved with.
[03:34:55.660 --> 03:34:59.140]  Now, before we go on, I got some St. Patrick's news coming up, but we have a St. Patrick's
[03:34:59.140 --> 03:35:07.900]  Day flash sale, Survival Shield X2, 37% off retail and that's the X2, Nasin, iodine that
[03:35:07.900 --> 03:35:09.020]  I am a big fan of.
[03:35:09.020 --> 03:35:14.340]  I've taken a lot of that, I put it in my mixed shakes that I have about every other day.
[03:35:14.340 --> 03:35:19.980]  And I was taking out the food supply and how populations gained as much as 15 points that
[03:35:19.980 --> 03:35:21.900]  was put back in in the 1990s.
[03:35:21.900 --> 03:35:24.100]  Now the newest iodine discovery is being revealed.
[03:35:24.100 --> 03:35:26.300]  Iodine works with the gut to promote optimum health.
[03:35:26.300 --> 03:35:27.660]  The research is clear.
[03:35:27.660 --> 03:35:30.420]  Iodine is the key and now is the time to stock up.
[03:35:30.420 --> 03:35:36.780]  37% off with this flash sale for St. Patrick's Day and I'm going to get into the St. Patrick's
[03:35:36.780 --> 03:35:42.580]  conspiracy, I guess we'll call it that coming up, but first I want to get to this video
[03:35:42.580 --> 03:35:46.500]  from Alex Jones, who we produced this last night for the Nightly News, talking about
[03:35:46.500 --> 03:35:52.140]  how Anonymous is also teaming up with the billionaire class, George Soros and others,
[03:35:52.140 --> 03:35:53.900]  who don't like Donald Trump.
[03:35:53.900 --> 03:35:59.620]  It is the rest of the system of billionaires and globalists going against Donald Trump,
[03:35:59.620 --> 03:36:03.180]  which is why I think people should support him and definitely take a look at him if you're
[03:36:03.180 --> 03:36:06.860]  a Bernie Sanders supporter and think you're going to get all this free stuff.
[03:36:06.860 --> 03:36:09.900]  I mean, look at Trump's health care plan, just that on its face.
[03:36:09.900 --> 03:36:14.540]  He put it out there way better than Obamacare, what you get right now because it offers transparency.
[03:36:14.540 --> 03:36:19.020]  It offers to look at the cost, it lets you go shopping all across the country instead
[03:36:19.020 --> 03:36:22.940]  of being stuck in your state, which is how it is now and it's all, all the costs are
[03:36:22.940 --> 03:36:23.940]  hidden and secret.
[03:36:23.940 --> 03:36:27.100]  You don't know anything until you see the bill, which is a bunch of crud because that
[03:36:27.100 --> 03:36:28.820]  doesn't happen in any other industry.
[03:36:28.820 --> 03:36:33.660]  And now Obama is forcing you to buy that insurance and the fines are getting larger.
[03:36:33.660 --> 03:36:38.260]  So let's go to Alex Jones' report now on what's going on with the Democratic Spring.
[03:36:38.260 --> 03:36:42.380]  A lot of people ask me, why do you support Donald Trump?
[03:36:42.380 --> 03:36:43.380]  Well it's simple.
[03:36:43.380 --> 03:36:46.300]  The establishment is scared to death of him for real.
[03:36:46.300 --> 03:36:52.260]  The private Federal Reserve just gave the majority of its money to Hillary Clinton a
[03:36:52.260 --> 03:36:57.180]  small amount of political donations to Ted Cruz and zero to Donald Trump.
[03:36:57.180 --> 03:37:01.580]  The Chinese Communist government comes out and threatens Americans not to vote for him.
[03:37:01.580 --> 03:37:03.580]  The Japanese government says they're scared.
[03:37:03.580 --> 03:37:08.020]  The Mexican government, the British government talks about banning him coming over there.
[03:37:08.020 --> 03:37:11.300]  The Democratic Party, the Republican Party comes out against him.
[03:37:11.300 --> 03:37:15.500]  Obama tells us he's disqualified, he's not allowed to run for president.
[03:37:15.500 --> 03:37:19.580]  I continue to believe Mr. Trump will not be president.
[03:37:19.580 --> 03:37:24.940]  Now the Republican leaderships come out and said, we do plan to steal the election at
[03:37:24.940 --> 03:37:29.420]  the RNC convention never before been done.
[03:37:29.420 --> 03:37:34.140]  The establishment we claim we hate, the establishment we claim we do anything to throw out, just
[03:37:34.140 --> 03:37:36.500]  give us somebody with integrity.
[03:37:36.500 --> 03:37:41.940]  He's scared to death of Donald Trump and still 20, 30% of Republicans and the vast majority
[03:37:41.940 --> 03:37:47.940]  of Democrats sit there on the sideline because he's brash and he doesn't use cue cards.
[03:37:47.940 --> 03:37:49.980]  Isn't that what everybody's looking for?
[03:37:49.980 --> 03:37:54.860]  Listen, I disagree with Donald Trump on things like imminent domain and his interpretation
[03:37:54.860 --> 03:37:59.660]  of that and the whole iPhone controversy, but when you start looking at why the elite
[03:37:59.660 --> 03:38:04.940]  are so scared of Donald Trump, it's what makes me so confident in my support of him.
[03:38:04.940 --> 03:38:10.180]  He is against globalism and unfair trade deals that our criminal politicians are making to
[03:38:10.180 --> 03:38:14.900]  sell us out because they become the directors and the beneficiaries of those deals that
[03:38:14.900 --> 03:38:16.540]  sell us down the river.
[03:38:16.540 --> 03:38:22.060]  Trump wants us to have sovereignty and he believes in strength and nationhood.
[03:38:22.060 --> 03:38:26.700]  He's a nationalist and that's why they are against him.
[03:38:26.700 --> 03:38:30.980]  He believes in this country and does want to make it great again.
[03:38:30.980 --> 03:38:36.060]  I hope he picks up the slogan, let's make America free again and starts coming out against
[03:38:36.060 --> 03:38:39.340]  more of the police state, but again, nobody's perfect.
[03:38:39.340 --> 03:38:44.340]  Now, George Soros, the famous Nazi collaborator, the guy that funded the Arab Spring and the
[03:38:44.340 --> 03:38:49.060]  overthrow of the Ukrainian government and more, who's been funding Black Lives Matter
[03:38:49.060 --> 03:38:53.620]  and their destabilization program around the country, they're coming out and saying they're
[03:38:53.620 --> 03:38:58.260]  going to organize starting next month, just about a week and a half away.
[03:38:58.260 --> 03:39:02.940]  The biggest attacks on his meetings ever.
[03:39:02.940 --> 03:39:08.220]  They're coming to his free speech events to interrupt and take over the entire events.
[03:39:08.220 --> 03:39:09.980]  These aren't demonstrations.
[03:39:09.980 --> 03:39:16.460]  These are attempts to shut down free speech and this new group has come out calling themselves
[03:39:16.460 --> 03:39:19.020]  the Democratic Spring.
[03:39:19.020 --> 03:39:25.180]  They're Al Gore called for an Arab Spring, but from leftist in America four years ago
[03:39:25.180 --> 03:39:30.260]  and that's exactly what they want, a revolution to shut down our free speech with political
[03:39:30.260 --> 03:39:35.340]  correctness and to bully the American people into submission and open borders to merge
[03:39:35.340 --> 03:39:37.100]  us into a world government.
[03:39:37.100 --> 03:39:39.820]  Then anonymous, who is anonymous?
[03:39:39.820 --> 03:39:45.060]  It's any group who wants to claim they're a white hat hacker.
[03:39:45.060 --> 03:39:51.020]  Coming out saying they declare total war on Donald Trump, attempting to get good hackers
[03:39:51.020 --> 03:39:52.780]  to join a fight against him.
[03:39:52.780 --> 03:39:57.100]  Dear Donald Trump, we have been watching you for a long time and what we see is deeply
[03:39:57.100 --> 03:39:58.100]  disturbing.
[03:39:58.100 --> 03:40:01.900]  You say what your current audience wants to hear, but in reality you don't stand for
[03:40:01.900 --> 03:40:05.220]  anything except for your personal greed and power.
[03:40:05.220 --> 03:40:07.100]  This is a call to arms.
[03:40:07.100 --> 03:40:11.380]  This is a call to the freedom fighters to the forgotten to the censored, to our fellow
[03:40:11.380 --> 03:40:13.780]  hackivists throughout the world.
[03:40:13.780 --> 03:40:18.580]  This is a call to protect our future, our freedom and our very way of life.
[03:40:18.580 --> 03:40:20.180]  This is a call to you.
[03:40:20.180 --> 03:40:23.380]  We need you to shut down his websites.
[03:40:23.380 --> 03:40:26.540]  Research and expose what he doesn't want the public to know.
[03:40:26.540 --> 03:40:30.420]  We need you to dismantle his campaign and sabotage his brand.
[03:40:30.420 --> 03:40:34.860]  We are encouraging every able person with a computer watching this video to participate
[03:40:34.860 --> 03:40:35.980]  in this operation.
[03:40:35.980 --> 03:40:39.740]  You do not need to know how to hack to support this important operation.
[03:40:39.740 --> 03:40:44.180]  I'm all for being anonymous, but to just say anonymous is the good guy and anonymous can
[03:40:44.180 --> 03:40:45.460]  be trusted.
[03:40:45.460 --> 03:40:48.180]  Anonymous is whoever they say they're anonymous.
[03:40:48.180 --> 03:40:53.620]  You could have a KKK grand dragon in there, you could have a Black Lives Matter racist
[03:40:53.620 --> 03:40:54.620]  in there.
[03:40:54.620 --> 03:40:58.220]  And don't forget it's Obama that said, if somebody brings a knife to a fight, you bring
[03:40:58.220 --> 03:40:59.220]  a gun.
[03:40:59.220 --> 03:41:04.380]  Yes, this is incendiary rhetoric, but it's protected free speech and it's not Donald
[03:41:04.380 --> 03:41:10.140]  Trump's fault for his speech that people are coming and linking arms and saying, coming
[03:41:10.140 --> 03:41:13.140]  through, excuse us, running people over.
[03:41:13.140 --> 03:41:18.620]  I personally have had leftist do this to me when I was out covering an abortion rally,
[03:41:18.620 --> 03:41:21.500]  an anti-abortion rally at Planned Parenthood.
[03:41:21.500 --> 03:41:24.340]  They believe it's their right to trample our free speech.
[03:41:24.340 --> 03:41:26.020]  They are totalitarians.
[03:41:26.020 --> 03:41:32.740]  So to the abortion groups and to the so-called anonymous groups over at the Soros Foundation
[03:41:32.740 --> 03:41:36.500]  and over at the Pentagon, the American people see through this.
[03:41:36.500 --> 03:41:41.300]  The military sees through this and more and more Americans are coming together against
[03:41:41.300 --> 03:41:42.300]  this tyranny.
[03:41:42.300 --> 03:41:47.060]  And we're going to have reporters out there in the field covering these Trump events and
[03:41:47.060 --> 03:41:50.860]  the attack on free speech, even if you don't agree with Donald Trump, even if you don't
[03:41:50.860 --> 03:41:52.260]  like Donald Trump.
[03:41:52.260 --> 03:41:58.460]  Now you've got to come out in support of free speech and support people's right to peaceably
[03:41:58.460 --> 03:42:05.340]  assemble and not have a bunch of brown shirt-style thugs, Cicera 1933 Germany, show up and start
[03:42:05.340 --> 03:42:08.060]  fights so they can then blame free speech.
[03:42:08.060 --> 03:42:12.620]  Let's go back to M4 Wars Nightly News and the rest of our exercise of the First Amendment
[03:42:12.620 --> 03:42:17.140]  because we're not going to let these bullies and tyrants shut down free speech.
[03:42:17.140 --> 03:42:21.020]  We're only going to exercise it more because it's just like muscles.
[03:42:21.020 --> 03:42:22.980]  If you don't use them, you'll lose them.
[03:42:22.980 --> 03:42:25.180]  So that's a message to all of you out there.
[03:42:25.180 --> 03:42:28.740]  Get out there and fight for freedom or lose it all.
[03:42:28.740 --> 03:42:29.740]  There you go.
[03:42:29.740 --> 03:42:33.820]  And I think it's really sad that these kids that are running around protesting Donald
[03:42:33.820 --> 03:42:37.660]  Trump, that they're really supporting the establishment.
[03:42:37.660 --> 03:42:39.260]  They're supporting big government.
[03:42:39.260 --> 03:42:40.420]  They're supporting more taxes.
[03:42:40.420 --> 03:42:42.380]  They think the government is there to help them.
[03:42:42.380 --> 03:42:46.740]  The government is there to take as much money from you and as much time from you as it possibly
[03:42:46.740 --> 03:42:47.940]  can.
[03:42:47.940 --> 03:42:48.940]  That's its only goal.
[03:42:48.940 --> 03:42:52.860]  It's only goals to get bigger and you people are being useful idiots.
[03:42:52.860 --> 03:42:57.460]  So those out there that go and are going to be violent, go out there.
[03:42:57.460 --> 03:42:59.300]  Use your free speech.
[03:42:59.300 --> 03:43:05.780]  Don't get violent, but you're on the wrong side of history and that's the sad thing.
[03:43:05.780 --> 03:43:06.780]  Let's go to Chad in Kentucky.
[03:43:06.780 --> 03:43:08.740]  Let's talk about Ron Paul versus Trump.
[03:43:08.740 --> 03:43:09.740]  Chad, go ahead.
[03:43:09.740 --> 03:43:10.740]  Hey, Ron.
[03:43:10.740 --> 03:43:16.100]  I just wanted to, that was a big supporter of the Ron Paul movement when they kind of
[03:43:16.100 --> 03:43:22.460]  stole it from him in 2012 and my question I guess is, yeah, and 08, but I mean, is this
[03:43:22.460 --> 03:43:29.380]  sport really grew in 2012 and I just, you know, I support Donald Trump at the beginning.
[03:43:29.380 --> 03:43:33.580]  I said it's either a gift from God for him or it's one of the greatest perceptions from
[03:43:33.580 --> 03:43:35.940]  the devil, but only time will tell.
[03:43:35.940 --> 03:43:39.060]  But I do stand with Trump and I would only vote for him and Ron Paul.
[03:43:39.060 --> 03:43:44.580]  But you know, I just want to know why shouldn't we be prepared for them to steal the election
[03:43:44.580 --> 03:43:49.300]  like they did with Ron Paul and we need to be kind of raising awareness to stay calm
[03:43:49.300 --> 03:43:53.780]  after they steal it because right now it just seems like a big, you know, ticking time bomb
[03:43:53.780 --> 03:43:57.620]  waiting to go off as soon as they steal it from him and the big hype is, you know, ready
[03:43:57.620 --> 03:43:58.620]  to go.
[03:43:58.620 --> 03:43:59.820]  They're slowly turning up the heat.
[03:43:59.820 --> 03:44:04.940]  You're going to see if he wins the public nomination, the facade that they put on that
[03:44:04.940 --> 03:44:11.340]  lets you think you actually have a voice, which now we see is totally false.
[03:44:11.340 --> 03:44:15.220]  You're going to see a bunch of people invested in Donald Trump, a bunch of people invested
[03:44:15.220 --> 03:44:19.060]  in whatever George Soros is pushing, you know, the brainwash masses that don't even know
[03:44:19.060 --> 03:44:20.060]  why they're protesting.
[03:44:20.060 --> 03:44:24.860]  They're just being told to buy their phones to go to this area and enchant that Trump's
[03:44:24.860 --> 03:44:29.420]  a racist and you're going to see these two groups clash.
[03:44:29.420 --> 03:44:33.980]  And then if they steal it from Trump, yeah, I do see some bad things happening.
[03:44:33.980 --> 03:44:37.700]  And now they're saying Trump is threatening violence and riots if he doesn't win.
[03:44:37.700 --> 03:44:42.020]  No, he's saying, you know what millions of people have voted for me more than any other
[03:44:42.020 --> 03:44:44.060]  Republican candidate out there right now.
[03:44:44.060 --> 03:44:46.100]  You're getting people that never voted voting for him.
[03:44:46.100 --> 03:44:50.060]  You're getting people jumping from Democrat to Republican to vote for him.
[03:44:50.060 --> 03:44:56.300]  He's saying he's bringing people together and what's going to happen when the rug is
[03:44:56.300 --> 03:44:59.740]  pulled out from them, you know, because it wasn't a large, there was a large majority
[03:44:59.740 --> 03:45:05.620]  of people for a vocal, I'd say vocal minority of people for Ron Paul and we were pissed when
[03:45:05.620 --> 03:45:06.620]  it got stolen from him.
[03:45:06.620 --> 03:45:11.500]  We could see it every time they put up a graphic didn't have Ron Paul or, you know, not mentioning
[03:45:11.500 --> 03:45:12.500]  him at all.
[03:45:12.500 --> 03:45:16.560]  They didn't show the first, second and fourth place or the first and third and fourth.
[03:45:16.560 --> 03:45:19.700]  They're always trying to admit Ron Paul from the debate because anytime you mentioned Ron
[03:45:19.700 --> 03:45:24.820]  Paul, you couldn't stop what he had to say because he was true veritas.
[03:45:24.820 --> 03:45:26.700]  And that's my opinion.
[03:45:26.700 --> 03:45:30.900]  Let's go to Dave and PA.
[03:45:30.900 --> 03:45:31.900]  Make it quick, Dave.
[03:45:31.900 --> 03:45:32.900]  Yeah.
[03:45:32.900 --> 03:45:33.900]  Hey, good afternoon.
[03:45:33.900 --> 03:45:37.860]  Rob, that's always a good show here at the end of the program.
[03:45:37.860 --> 03:45:38.860]  Thanks buddy.
[03:45:38.860 --> 03:45:43.580]  Hey, I was wondering, Alex is going up to Cleveland for the convention, right?
[03:45:43.580 --> 03:45:44.580]  Yeah.
[03:45:44.580 --> 03:45:49.380]  I should check in on the Obama phone lady, Michelle, who is out on the show over the
[03:45:49.380 --> 03:45:52.740]  years and I was wondering what her view is on Donald Trump.
[03:45:52.740 --> 03:45:54.300]  Yeah, that'll be interesting.
[03:45:54.300 --> 03:46:00.380]  She's, I would say she's probably going to be a Hillary supporter, but we'll see about
[03:46:00.380 --> 03:46:01.380]  the Obama phone lady.
[03:46:01.380 --> 03:46:05.580]  Nice lady brought her down here, tried to explain to her what the free market's all
[03:46:05.580 --> 03:46:10.260]  about and I'm not sure she's quite all in on free market.
[03:46:10.260 --> 03:46:18.660]  I think, you know, unfortunately, back in the 60s, a lot of blacks were sold the idea
[03:46:18.660 --> 03:46:22.100]  that big government's there to help them and protect their interests.
[03:46:22.100 --> 03:46:24.940]  And yes, there were some things that were done by government that were there to help
[03:46:24.940 --> 03:46:30.140]  them, but they also herded them into mass, you know, apartment complexes that they have
[03:46:30.140 --> 03:46:35.780]  turned into, you know, urban ghettos and have taken away their ability to, you know, become
[03:46:35.780 --> 03:46:36.780]  upwardly mobile.
[03:46:36.780 --> 03:46:38.220]  That's what I feel.
[03:46:38.220 --> 03:46:40.940]  And it's really sad that that's what's going on out there.
[03:46:40.940 --> 03:46:45.860]  Let's go to seal in Canada, uh, let's plug the infowars and waking people up.
[03:46:45.860 --> 03:46:46.860]  Go ahead.
[03:46:46.860 --> 03:46:47.860]  Seal.
[03:46:47.860 --> 03:46:50.900]  Robert, do you there?
[03:46:50.900 --> 03:46:51.900]  I am here.
[03:46:51.900 --> 03:46:52.900]  Hey.
[03:46:52.900 --> 03:46:53.900]  Excellent.
[03:46:53.900 --> 03:46:54.900]  How's it going?
[03:46:54.900 --> 03:46:55.900]  Here.
[03:46:55.900 --> 03:46:56.900]  Yeah.
[03:46:56.900 --> 03:46:59.100]  I've been trying to wake up people in my area here a long time and it's, it's ironic
[03:46:59.100 --> 03:47:03.020]  now, you know, I see all these newspaper stories past week about their wanting to close
[03:47:03.020 --> 03:47:06.820]  down the, the best coal mines in the world, the best coal, most productive, the least
[03:47:06.820 --> 03:47:10.660]  amount of pollution from, and it's funny, you know, they threw me in the can.
[03:47:10.660 --> 03:47:13.620]  I've been doing this mostly alone here, trying to wake people up.
[03:47:13.620 --> 03:47:17.380]  Now I see the last member of the legislature writes a letter to the newspaper, you know,
[03:47:17.380 --> 03:47:20.460]  and he says, uh, we're not denying there's climate change.
[03:47:20.460 --> 03:47:22.700]  We're not denying there's greenhouse gases.
[03:47:22.700 --> 03:47:24.180]  They don't want to be called deniers, right?
[03:47:24.180 --> 03:47:25.180]  And I go on.
[03:47:25.180 --> 03:47:28.060]  Well, we are denying this, that this cannot all be placed on coal.
[03:47:28.060 --> 03:47:30.940]  Well, he's a coal associated association man now.
[03:47:30.940 --> 03:47:35.500]  He's talking to the new premier of the province, all these people writing these stories.
[03:47:35.500 --> 03:47:40.540]  I want to tell you, you know, uh, Dr. Begich, uh, from Alaska, we read his book.
[03:47:40.540 --> 03:47:43.660]  I, an old 90-some year old friend of mine passed away now.
[03:47:43.660 --> 03:47:48.380]  We read his book, uh, back at 22 years ago, angels don't play this harp.
[03:47:48.380 --> 03:47:52.860]  They're brainwashed and they're hypnotizing them, uh, with their cell phones, with, uh,
[03:47:52.860 --> 03:47:55.780]  the mainstream media, their television sets.
[03:47:55.780 --> 03:47:56.780]  They're being brainwashed.
[03:47:56.780 --> 03:48:00.660]  Yeah, they're being hit from all angles and it is humans are bad.
[03:48:00.660 --> 03:48:01.660]  Breathing is bad.
[03:48:01.660 --> 03:48:03.260]  Breathing is bad for the environment.
[03:48:03.260 --> 03:48:04.740]  Coals bad for the environment.
[03:48:04.740 --> 03:48:09.580]  Uh, and fortunately coal is what provides us cheap power and cheap power provides innovation.
[03:48:09.580 --> 03:48:13.540]  Whether people like that or not, whether they would agree with that or not, those are facts.
[03:48:13.540 --> 03:48:18.380]  And when you set up giant windmills or giant solar farms and, and you try to make this
[03:48:18.380 --> 03:48:22.220]  collectivist notion of, of that type of renewable energy, it doesn't work.
[03:48:22.220 --> 03:48:23.420]  It doesn't work.
[03:48:23.420 --> 03:48:26.380]  Those things only work on a small scale per individual basis.
[03:48:26.380 --> 03:48:28.540]  Oh, but then you wouldn't have people buying into the grid.
[03:48:28.540 --> 03:48:29.980]  We can't have that.
[03:48:29.980 --> 03:48:34.620]  We can't have people being self-sufficient because then they wouldn't need the government.
[03:48:34.620 --> 03:48:37.140]  Oh, we can't have that, especially in Canada.
[03:48:37.140 --> 03:48:40.460]  You know, we got to have our, so, but hey, when people lose their jobs in the coal plants
[03:48:40.460 --> 03:48:44.220]  and when people are paying double triple prices in power, they're going to start complaining
[03:48:44.220 --> 03:48:48.060]  and start rioting then, and they won't realize that they were the people calling for that.
[03:48:48.060 --> 03:48:52.380]  The same people who are the victims of that system are going to be calling for a change
[03:48:52.380 --> 03:48:54.020]  once it starts hitting their pocketbook.
[03:48:54.020 --> 03:48:55.700]  So, and it's already happening.
[03:48:55.700 --> 03:48:56.700]  So, it's sad.
[03:48:56.700 --> 03:48:57.700]  Very sad.
[03:48:57.700 --> 03:49:02.020]  Hey, I want to, I'm a, I was a big Jurassic Park fan when it came out and the idea of
[03:49:02.020 --> 03:49:03.020]  cloning dinosaurs.
[03:49:03.020 --> 03:49:05.460]  I was a huge dinosaur fan as a kid.
[03:49:05.460 --> 03:49:10.060]  Scientists closer to cloning TRX after discovering remains a pregnant dinosaur.
[03:49:10.060 --> 03:49:14.140]  So, they say, well, dinosaur bones do contain some DNA.
[03:49:14.140 --> 03:49:18.180]  The bone known as the medullary bone that grows in female dinosaurs during pregnancy
[03:49:18.180 --> 03:49:20.620]  will contain a lot more DNA.
[03:49:20.620 --> 03:49:26.380]  And Lindsay Zanow, an assistant research professor of biological sciences at NC State University
[03:49:26.380 --> 03:49:31.060]  said it's possible that the dinosaurs and its eggs contain the necessary DNA for the
[03:49:31.060 --> 03:49:35.660]  building blocks of life to take scientists a step closer to reintroducing dinosaurs into
[03:49:35.660 --> 03:49:37.780]  the world.
[03:49:37.780 --> 03:49:40.860]  That would definitely be cool, but I don't know if it would be good for the earth.
[03:49:40.860 --> 03:49:45.140]  I think it would be interesting to see, but, you know, we got billionaires cloning their
[03:49:45.140 --> 03:49:51.580]  dogs and billionaire Barry Diller and Diane von Furstenberg cloned their dog and they
[03:49:51.580 --> 03:49:58.540]  did it with a Korean firm for $100,000 that takes the DNA implants DNA into a dog egg.
[03:49:58.540 --> 03:50:00.740]  So it happened.
[03:50:00.740 --> 03:50:04.420]  They have a two puppies now from their original dog.
[03:50:04.420 --> 03:50:06.500]  So who knows where that's going pretty soon.
[03:50:06.500 --> 03:50:07.500]  They'll be cloning humans.
[03:50:07.500 --> 03:50:09.900]  Oh wait, they probably are.
[03:50:09.900 --> 03:50:14.260]  And I think when I come back from break, we'll go over this St. Patrick's Day conspiracy
[03:50:14.260 --> 03:50:16.140]  since it is St. Patrick's Day.
[03:50:16.140 --> 03:50:17.140]  It's not green.
[03:50:17.140 --> 03:50:18.640]  You should be wearing actually people.
[03:50:18.640 --> 03:50:22.060]  It's a different color, the color I'd be holding in my hand.
[03:50:22.060 --> 03:50:25.820]  All right, sorry for that.
[03:50:25.820 --> 03:50:30.780]  Let's go to Ralph in Virginia, Trump and Larry Nichols.
[03:50:30.780 --> 03:50:31.780]  Go ahead.

[03:50:32.780 --> 03:50:33.780]  Go, go, Ralph.
[03:50:33.780 --> 03:50:41.340]  I was trying to figure out, man, since the Facebook page is on a Saturday with Larry
[03:50:41.340 --> 03:50:47.100]  Nichols came on, went to the hospital, A will be okay and D, what are you talking about
[03:50:47.100 --> 03:50:49.780]  about the A3D enabler accident?
[03:50:49.780 --> 03:50:50.780]  I'll find out.
[03:50:50.780 --> 03:50:52.300]  Hey, I think he's going to be a guest tomorrow.
[03:50:52.300 --> 03:50:53.700]  I'll find out that let you know after the break.

[03:54:33.300 --> 03:54:36.420]  but it looks like we're going to get him on next week, so I think he's back out of
[03:54:36.420 --> 03:54:37.420]  the hospital.
[03:54:37.420 --> 03:54:41.740]  I don't know all the details, but yeah, Alex did do a Facebook Mentions on Friday about
[03:54:41.740 --> 03:54:42.740]  that.
[03:54:42.740 --> 03:54:48.620]  And if you're not signed on to Alex's Facebook page, Alexander Emmerich Jones is the Facebook,

[03:54:52.840 --> 03:54:54.020]  watching them immediately.
[03:54:54.020 --> 03:54:56.700]  It's really amazing technology.
[03:54:56.700 --> 03:54:59.260]  I'm going to go to Brenda and Chase, standby.
[03:54:59.260 --> 03:55:02.620]  Have your point ready to be made, you remember, or not going to have much time.
[03:55:02.620 --> 03:55:03.620]  Here it is from Catholic Online.
[03:55:03.620 --> 03:55:07.340]  I bet you didn't know these 10 things about St. Patrick in Ireland, March 17th was when
[03:55:07.340 --> 03:55:08.340]  he died.
[03:55:08.340 --> 03:55:10.820]  That's why we celebrate St. Patrick's Day on the 17th.
[03:55:10.820 --> 03:55:12.060]  St. Patrick wasn't Irish.
[03:55:12.060 --> 03:55:14.460]  His parents were Roman citizens.
[03:55:14.460 --> 03:55:16.100]  St. Patrick was also a slave.
[03:55:16.100 --> 03:55:20.500]  He was kidnapped when he was 16, and he lived in Ireland for a few years and then escaped
[03:55:20.500 --> 03:55:24.260]  to England at the age of 22, and then became a monk.
[03:55:24.260 --> 03:55:26.820]  St. Patrick used the shamrock to preach about the trinity.
[03:55:26.820 --> 03:55:33.380]  He's usually have three leaves there on the shamrock, and legend says St. Patrick drove
[03:55:33.380 --> 03:55:34.700]  all the snakes from Ireland.
[03:55:34.700 --> 03:55:40.060]  Now we know that there were no snakes in Ireland ever because of the way, you know, the climate
[03:55:40.060 --> 03:55:41.060]  was.
[03:55:41.060 --> 03:55:46.300]  And Patrick's color was what, blue is the original color associated with Patrick.
[03:55:46.300 --> 03:55:51.420]  I think it changed to green because they called Ireland the Emerald Isle, and the shamrock
[03:55:51.420 --> 03:55:53.260]  is not the symbol of Ireland.
[03:55:53.260 --> 03:55:57.540]  There are more Irish in the USA than Ireland, and St. Patrick's Day is a strong political
[03:55:57.540 --> 03:56:02.100]  history because in the mid-19th century, the Irish faced a lot of discrimination, much
[03:56:02.100 --> 03:56:04.180]  like African Americans.
[03:56:04.180 --> 03:56:08.660]  And a few rare instances, prejudice against the Irish was even more fierce.
[03:56:08.660 --> 03:56:13.100]  So they started celebrating St. Patrick's Day to get together and show that, what an
[03:56:13.100 --> 03:56:14.580]  Irish, shouldn't we like to drink?
[03:56:14.580 --> 03:56:17.100]  Actually, they didn't start drinking until 1970.
[03:56:17.100 --> 03:56:22.700]  So from 1903 to 1970, it was a religious holiday, and pubs were closed for the day.
[03:56:22.700 --> 03:56:25.020]  Oh, the horror.
[03:56:25.020 --> 03:56:26.660]  There you go.
[03:56:26.660 --> 03:56:28.980]  So let's go to Brenda in Minnesota.
[03:56:28.980 --> 03:56:30.580]  She wants to talk about the solution.
[03:56:30.580 --> 03:56:31.580]  Brenda, go ahead.
[03:56:31.580 --> 03:56:32.580]  I can hear you.
[03:56:32.580 --> 03:56:37.540]  I've been a listener since, I've been a listener since Trump was first on the show.
[03:56:37.540 --> 03:56:43.020]  You and Trump and the product have given me a level of mental clarity and an understanding
[03:56:43.020 --> 03:56:46.620]  of the truth that gives me hope like I've never had before.
[03:56:46.620 --> 03:56:52.020]  And the point I want to make is, we need to keep focusing on the highest level of truth,
[03:56:52.020 --> 03:56:58.580]  like Alex did today when he went on his rant segment on George Soros, showing the methods
[03:56:58.580 --> 03:57:03.940]  to his madness so that the people can understand how they're being controlled as puppets.
[03:57:03.940 --> 03:57:10.660]  And it won't matter what the RNC is trying to do because they'll be won over by the truth.
[03:57:10.660 --> 03:57:16.380]  The truth is what Alex and Trump are using to set the people free.
[03:57:16.380 --> 03:57:21.060]  And once you've seen the truth, there's no way to turn back and you are loyal forever.
[03:57:21.060 --> 03:57:23.100]  Yeah, Trump just says he's the messenger.
[03:57:23.100 --> 03:57:24.780]  He's not the one out there.
[03:57:24.780 --> 03:57:25.780]  He's not the one saying this stuff.
[03:57:25.780 --> 03:57:28.340]  These are what people are telling him.
[03:57:28.340 --> 03:57:31.740]  So there's a lot of people obviously pissed off at what's going on in this country, and
[03:57:31.740 --> 03:57:34.860]  they're not all racist and they're not all xenophobes.
[03:57:34.860 --> 03:57:39.060]  So you can't just sit there and paint everybody with a broad brush because that's what people
[03:57:39.060 --> 03:57:42.620]  used to do to minorities, and that's wrong when they did it too.
[03:57:42.620 --> 03:57:44.900]  So it has to be wrong on all cases.
[03:57:44.900 --> 03:57:48.340]  Not everybody gets this little free pass, you know.
[03:57:48.340 --> 03:57:51.380]  Chase in Texas, you're going to be our tail gunner, people marching for 10 days on the
[03:57:51.380 --> 03:57:52.380]  east coast.
[03:57:52.380 --> 03:57:53.380]  Are you going to be joining them?
[03:57:53.380 --> 03:57:54.380]  No, sir.
[03:57:54.380 --> 03:57:58.420]  Amen to the last caller.
[03:57:58.420 --> 03:57:59.420]  That was Veritas.
[03:57:59.420 --> 03:58:00.420]  You're exactly right.
[03:58:00.420 --> 03:58:01.420]  Go ahead.
[03:58:01.420 --> 03:58:02.420]  Yes, sir.
[03:58:02.420 --> 03:58:05.820]  When Obama ran, he talked about shovel ready job.
[03:58:05.820 --> 03:58:10.700]  If that would have been true, this is a simple point that I'm making on it.
[03:58:10.700 --> 03:58:15.100]  But if that would have been true, they wouldn't have time to go march down I-95 or whatever
[03:58:15.100 --> 03:58:16.340]  they're planning.
[03:58:16.340 --> 03:58:18.100]  But let's flip it on the other side.
[03:58:18.100 --> 03:58:22.620]  Think of all those people that if you're an info warrior trying to wake them up and
[03:58:22.620 --> 03:58:27.460]  you can't reach them, if they stop juggling all those plates in the air, and we do that
[03:58:27.460 --> 03:58:31.780]  and get to do a force-gump movement, I guarantee you we can bring it down and do it and bring
[03:58:31.780 --> 03:58:34.260]  it back right like the mighty Phoenix rose up.
[03:58:34.260 --> 03:58:36.260]  Well said, brother.
[03:58:36.260 --> 03:58:37.260]  We'll see you next time.
[03:58:37.260 --> 03:59:05.260]  Thank you, Mr. President, for the info wars nightly news.
