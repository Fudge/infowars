[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.760]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.760 --> 00:36.480]  we are live ladies and gentlemen it is Thursday the 20th day of August 2009
[00:36.480 --> 00:43.160]  and we live here for the next four hours coming up in the last hour today we
[00:43.160 --> 00:50.560]  have Michael he's not giving the public his last name he is the gentleman with
[00:50.560 --> 00:58.600]  the AR-15 strapped to his back in Phoenix along with the media reported as
[00:58.600 --> 01:11.040]  many as 14 other open carry citizens pointing out that the second amendment
[01:11.040 --> 01:17.160]  is an absolute right to keep bare arms and really they're coming out of the
[01:17.160 --> 01:27.520]  closet that's what they're doing because they've literally made gun owners hide
[01:27.520 --> 01:33.040]  in their homes in Texas most people sneak out with their firearm to go to the
[01:33.040 --> 01:36.440]  shooting range neighbors are greedily watching wanting to call the police the
[01:36.440 --> 01:41.880]  guns not illegal but the cops still come even in my own state how pathetic
[01:41.880 --> 01:49.760]  and castrated we are and so what Michael and others are doing all across the
[01:49.760 --> 01:56.400]  country is showing the mindless dumbed-down brainwashed public that has
[01:56.400 --> 02:01.280]  turned it into a religious sacrament people love their slavery it's like
[02:01.280 --> 02:06.320]  it's their possession or something that they get so upset when they see a
[02:06.320 --> 02:13.400]  fellow slave a surf of the New World Order standing up and saying no I'm a
[02:13.400 --> 02:19.080]  freeman I'm allowed to keep their arms I'm not your property but when they see
[02:19.080 --> 02:23.280]  the giant police state arming and amassing military force against the
[02:23.280 --> 02:27.520]  people the Pentagon openly announcing
[02:28.400 --> 02:32.800]  400,000 combat troops to now be on the streets of America governor's
[02:32.800 --> 02:38.440]  association saying stop it but the general public has no idea what's
[02:38.440 --> 02:43.920]  happening no conception of history or what's going on either people are awake
[02:43.920 --> 02:49.880]  or they're totally unawake they're totally asleep it's either or and there
[02:49.880 --> 02:53.280]  is a massive awakening happening right now there's been a huge paradigm shift
[02:53.280 --> 02:57.520]  on multi levels so the establishment is going to move in with the stage crises
[02:57.520 --> 03:05.440]  staged economic collapse stage terror stage bio weapon releases staged wars
[03:05.440 --> 03:12.520]  staged racial conflict and infighting it's it's all happening so he'll be
[03:12.520 --> 03:17.480]  joining us he hasn't done interviews on Fox and CNN and he's been people have

[03:35.240 --> 03:41.720]  gentleman Michael very intelligent very well-spoken really laid the points out
[03:41.720 --> 03:45.360]  more succinctly than I would I'm tend to be long-winded when he did talk to the
[03:45.360 --> 03:53.080]  K.P. live at the event he just did a great job and we're really honored to
[03:53.080 --> 03:58.400]  have him coming up he's gonna be joining us from what Ernest Hancock's radio

[04:27.520 --> 04:32.800]  pesticides you know we had Dr. Russell Blalock on a few days ago and he laid
[04:32.800 --> 04:39.560]  out the fact that yes when they chopped people's brains up now under microscope
[04:39.560 --> 04:46.760]  they do see that all the pesticides the chemicals the vaccines that it's just
[04:46.760 --> 04:51.640]  literally brain damaging the population and that's why people seem so dull is
[04:51.640 --> 04:55.920]  it's the fluoride and all the rest of it we've been chemically lobotomized all of

[08:05.160 --> 08:24.520]  show because there's a war on for your mind
[08:24.520 --> 08:33.720]  all right here is what I'm going to do I'm just gonna open the phones up right
[08:33.720 --> 08:40.080]  now because I got in here this morning with all the stacks of news I've printed
[08:40.080 --> 08:45.840]  off and all the video clips I have and all the points I want to make and instead
[08:45.840 --> 08:50.800]  of just starting to show out with a 30 minute 45 minute hour hour and 20 minute
[08:50.800 --> 08:56.400]  long rant on three or four issues I just want to open the phones up for the
[08:56.400 --> 09:03.920]  next hour and when I start the second hour I will immediately get into the
[09:03.920 --> 09:10.600]  latest healthcare developments the latest initiatives for the carbon tax
[09:10.600 --> 09:18.600]  big things happening there with the head of Greenpeace admitting that they lie
[09:18.600 --> 09:24.400]  about the Arctic ice sheets melting just incredible videos and then you have a
[09:24.400 --> 09:29.440]  video from South Texas that unfortunately is something I've seen far too
[09:29.440 --> 09:33.080]  often it's up on the Alex Jones channel on YouTube if you want to find it I'm
[09:33.080 --> 09:37.960]  getting curtain Paul Watson and others to post it on info wars comm in
[09:37.960 --> 09:43.240]  prison planet calm maybe write a blurb about it in fact that's going to be our
[09:43.240 --> 09:52.000]  top story when I start the second hour today is my comments on this video I'm
[09:52.000 --> 09:57.880]  debating whether I should play it here because the illegal aliens are screaming
[09:57.880 --> 10:04.480]  the n-word over and over again and
[10:12.720 --> 10:17.440]  and they're sitting there screaming it over and over again it's a town hall
[10:17.440 --> 10:23.040]  meeting and they're there wanting the Obama healthcare plan because it states
[10:23.040 --> 10:26.160]  they're gonna get unlimited free health care horse illegal aliens already get
[10:26.160 --> 10:30.240]  that and they know that they go to the head of the line the cities are mandated
[10:30.240 --> 10:35.320]  by the feds to not refuse care at the emergency room everybody knows that they
[10:35.320 --> 10:38.800]  get free births free everything and they're left alone because the
[10:38.800 --> 10:41.600]  establishment doesn't want to scare them away they want them here to drive down
[10:41.600 --> 10:46.680]  the wages now if you're a poor Hispanic American or a poor black American or a
[10:46.680 --> 10:52.480]  poor Anglo-American and you come in and want the free birth half the time they
[10:52.480 --> 10:56.800]  try to steal your child at least here in Austin they do I mean they're there
[10:56.800 --> 11:00.480]  testing your blood to try to find any marijuana there they're asking you if
[11:00.480 --> 11:03.600]  you're poor they're asking you where you're staying if you say well I'm
[11:03.600 --> 11:07.080]  staying in my parents room they go ahead and steal your kid right there on the
[11:07.080 --> 11:11.680]  spot and I've got the banking association a few years ago in the AP saying
[11:11.680 --> 11:14.880]  yeah we give the illegal aliens houses even though they don't even have any
[11:14.880 --> 11:20.000]  documents because we we want to make things easier for him here in America
[11:20.000 --> 11:24.720]  well it's illegal aliens running around with Mexican flags waving them
[11:24.720 --> 11:31.600]  mariachi bands coming up laughing and screaming and calling black people the
[11:31.600 --> 11:39.240]  inward over and over screaming the inward at a black cop but you know what it's so
[11:39.240 --> 11:42.360]  horrible and evil I may just have to I think I'm gonna go ahead and play it I
[11:42.360 --> 11:46.800]  mean because we also can't have this inward be like some religious sacrament
[11:46.800 --> 11:53.760]  where if you say it it's got so much power like abracadabra that everybody
[11:53.760 --> 11:58.800]  goes into cardiac arrest and then when somebody uses the word we you know can't
[11:58.800 --> 12:03.720]  even play the clip to demonstrate what they're saying and doing
[12:03.720 --> 12:16.280]  people need to hear what is being said what is being done but I'll get people
[12:16.280 --> 12:20.960]  fair warning they don't want their kids hearing it over and over again because
[12:20.960 --> 12:24.400]  they say it over and over again I mean I thought about trying to edit it out but
[12:24.400 --> 12:28.840]  it would probably take one of my guys hours to capture the video and then
[12:28.840 --> 12:35.080]  edit the pieces out and then upload it again to the web in fact let's contact
[12:35.080 --> 12:39.880]  the folks running this YouTube channel I'm familiar with their work and let's
[12:39.880 --> 12:43.080]  get them on in the next few days to talk about what they witnessed but I mean the
[12:43.080 --> 12:48.960]  cameras says it all the illegal aliens start trying to beat people up the
[12:48.960 --> 12:52.520]  police are very very lenient because they don't want to create a any type of
[12:52.520 --> 12:59.200]  scene but finally they have to physically restrain and it's mariachi
[12:59.200 --> 13:04.200]  bands people with Mexican flags screaming this is our country we outnumber you
[13:04.200 --> 13:11.960]  this is Mexico we're going to get you and what's sad about this is there's
[13:11.960 --> 13:15.920]  nobody in my experience growing up in Texas more patriotic people that love
[13:15.920 --> 13:20.720]  liberty than his spanish-americans they're just salt of the earth great
[13:20.720 --> 13:28.880]  people and they need to speak out against these illegal aliens that hate
[13:28.880 --> 13:34.280]  this country I mean we just can't sit here and ignore what's going on I mean
[13:34.280 --> 13:40.640]  I've been out at demonstrations in Austin for the second amendment or for
[13:40.640 --> 13:46.720]  sovereignty issues and it's been in the newspaper and people show up in Aztec
[13:46.720 --> 13:52.480]  outfits pushing and hitting and starting fights and coming up and grabbing the
[13:52.480 --> 13:56.840]  microphone and we had a Texas Independence Day birthday party at UT and
[13:56.840 --> 14:00.240]  they said you're not allowed to have Texas independence and they ran up and
[14:00.240 --> 14:04.000]  grabbed the cake and put a bunch of it their mouth and spit it back out on the
[14:04.000 --> 14:09.760]  cake to ruin it and the police did nothing and screaming that I was the
[14:09.760 --> 14:12.640]  racist and I've been to other events where they're wearing these shirts that
[14:12.640 --> 14:18.080]  say we're gonna carry out the plan of San Diego green and yellow shirts and then
[14:18.080 --> 14:26.040]  I had a UT professor who was Hispanic by the way and then separately somebody
[14:26.040 --> 14:29.920]  else pointed it out to me go you know what that plan of San Diego is mr. Jones
[14:29.920 --> 14:33.600]  now it's you know I said no he goes go look it up when you get home and I did
[14:33.600 --> 14:37.480]  and sure enough there were all the major university reports about it the plan to
[14:37.480 --> 14:44.960]  kill all whites below the age of 16 they just reeducate you all all anglos above
[14:44.960 --> 14:49.440]  the age of 16 and so you'll you'll go to these events they'll be going plan of
[14:49.440 --> 14:53.280]  San Diego plan of San Diego we're going to kill you we're going to kill you in
[14:53.280 --> 14:58.520]  Spanish and then you're just supposed to go oh I love you but see this is
[14:58.520 --> 15:03.440]  exactly what the New World Order wants point is I'm gonna we're gonna go live
[15:03.440 --> 15:10.080]  at prisonplanet.tv in the next hour my plane got in late last night was
[15:10.080 --> 15:21.000]  delayed by a couple hours and so I'm a little bit dingy this morning but I'm
[15:21.000 --> 15:26.800]  I've been up for a while but I just can't get myself to awaken fully which
[15:26.800 --> 15:33.280]  actually might be a good thing some of people like the sub dude show of course
[15:33.280 --> 15:40.200]  the real reason and I'm really tired is that I never was a heavy drinker but I
[15:40.200 --> 15:42.880]  quit drinking completely like seven months ago and I got bored on the
[15:42.880 --> 15:48.360]  airplane last night and one drink turned into about five and so I have a nice
[15:48.360 --> 15:58.160]  headache to remind me that the drinking is not fun it was fun while I was doing
[15:58.160 --> 16:01.160]  it laughing and joking with the two people that was another thing usually
[16:01.160 --> 16:07.560]  you're crammed in between you know these uptight business travelers who who are
[16:07.560 --> 16:11.920]  too busy acting elitist and cool to ever even talk to you on a plane but I was
[16:11.920 --> 16:18.560]  in between two friendly nice people plus I got such an incredible interview with
[16:18.560 --> 16:23.440]  Jesse Ventura in Los Angeles yesterday and I did some other things while I was
[16:23.440 --> 16:27.720]  there that I'm not going to talk about the next few months but that's
[16:27.720 --> 16:36.200]  unbelievable all the cool things that are going on and you know I'm just being
[16:36.200 --> 16:43.560]  real here folks I'm just sad about it because I don't want to be in a fight
[16:43.560 --> 16:48.920]  with the illegal aliens I don't want to hate these people I don't but I know
[16:48.920 --> 16:54.600]  they hate me and I know the globalists are using them to help break down the
[16:54.600 --> 17:00.560]  wages and vulcanize and get us at each other's throats and I know that there's
[17:00.560 --> 17:05.320]  conservatively 30 million illegal aliens in this country and I'd say about half
[17:05.320 --> 17:11.560]  of them are hardcore racist nationalist nationalist isn't bad thing I mean we
[17:11.560 --> 17:15.800]  see we've had our immune system taken away we've had our nationalism removed
[17:15.800 --> 17:22.600]  demonized gilded castrated and then Mexico is one of the most nationalistic
[17:22.600 --> 17:30.760]  countries in the world and they've been oppressed so long their intelligence
[17:30.760 --> 17:34.960]  smart hard-working people but their society's so corrupt and they have such
[17:34.960 --> 17:38.640]  an interesting history that there's a lot of anger and pent-up rage and that's
[17:38.640 --> 17:43.240]  not allowed in Mexico they just kill you police drop by take out the field shoot
[17:43.240 --> 17:47.280]  you in the back of the head that's the second time if you don't shut up the
[17:47.280 --> 17:51.400]  first time they take Tabasco that's the brand they use and they pour it down your
[17:51.400 --> 17:56.000]  nose with you upside down in a chair and then they they shake up a sprite and
[17:56.000 --> 18:01.480]  shoot up your nose reportedly it makes Abu Ghraib torture and people being
[18:01.480 --> 18:07.040]  raped with acid nothing and then the next time they kill you they take out a
[18:07.040 --> 18:10.840]  field they get you down they shoot you in the back of the head so see these
[18:10.840 --> 18:17.240]  people have been have been in many cases bravely fought even against police with
[18:17.240 --> 18:21.760]  machine guns mowing them down just last year again in several cities but see up
[18:21.760 --> 18:26.560]  here the foundations the Ford Foundation has put more than 40 billion
[18:26.560 --> 18:29.840]  dollars and they even have more that more than that in their war chest but
[18:29.840 --> 18:34.040]  over 40 billion the last 30 years since they've really been doing this with
[18:34.040 --> 18:48.160]  liberation theology liberation theology and that's basically says rise up
[18:48.160 --> 18:52.240]  against whitey killing well the only thing that's happening here is the
[18:52.240 --> 18:56.920]  big the big egg-headed whiteies know there's only a few of them so they've
[18:56.920 --> 19:03.560]  got to play groups off against each other and their main enemy is middle class
[19:03.560 --> 19:10.080]  America which is predominantly white so you have huge groups of Hispanics and
[19:10.080 --> 19:12.760]  blacks but they've been minorities obviously they're not the majority of
[19:12.760 --> 19:18.200]  the middle class but you notice the black middle class and Hispanic middle
[19:18.200 --> 19:21.520]  class and Asia middle class they're out at these tea parties and things they
[19:21.520 --> 19:25.360]  know what's happening they are educated they've got businesses they understand
[19:25.360 --> 19:30.200]  what government is a parasitic proboscis sucking out all their wealth
[19:30.200 --> 19:36.280]  to offshore banks but you see the big money comes in and funds the poor
[19:36.280 --> 19:40.640]  revolutionary underclass to wage war against the middle class it's pressure
[19:40.640 --> 19:44.880]  from above and below and it's in government handbooks so I don't know
[19:44.880 --> 19:48.320]  what we do but I you know what I just can't stand seeing people with mariachi
[19:48.320 --> 19:52.880]  bands pulling down the American flag and waving the Mexican flag I mean it's a
[19:52.880 --> 19:56.240]  good thing I wasn't there because I can't take much more of this crap I'm

[23:16.320 --> 23:20.160]  prescription drugs that only mask the problem and leave you with horrible
[23:20.160 --> 23:24.040]  side effects doctors who have tried heart and body extract with their patients
[23:24.040 --> 23:28.320]  are thrilled with the results as well here's what Dr. Goodman has to say
[23:28.320 --> 23:32.160]  about his experience with the product if you notice that most times here at the
[23:32.160 --> 23:36.560]  drug ads on TV they have a list of possible side effects I find that if
[23:36.560 --> 23:39.920]  you're gonna take something that is you're trading one problem for five or
[23:39.920 --> 23:43.640]  six other problems that to me doesn't make sense in using something that is
[23:43.640 --> 23:48.000]  natural that is absorbed into the body typically because in a liquid form I
[23:48.000 --> 23:51.640]  think it's the best way to go call to order your two-month supply of heart and

[24:08.600 --> 24:17.280]  hour and continue with calls I do want to put the message out to the gentleman in
[24:17.280 --> 24:23.600]  Orlando Florida and the surrounding County in the town of Claremont the
[24:23.600 --> 24:29.320]  state is saying they're probably gonna charge him with a felony now remember
[24:29.320 --> 24:36.080]  Barack Obama was in the Washington Post and he said condom he spent a letter
[24:36.080 --> 24:42.920]  what's the word not the condemnation but the ones that thank people he sent
[24:42.920 --> 24:53.080]  letters thanking people for posting the hope change archetypal image of him
[24:53.080 --> 25:00.480]  during the campaign he said it looks great on stop signs and so what you have
[25:00.480 --> 25:11.640]  is massive selective enforcement going on here and the police admit that when
[25:11.640 --> 25:15.040]  they pulled down the posters that were all over the town of Claremont and then
[25:15.040 --> 25:19.240]  into surrounding towns and cities and all over Orlando that more of them were
[25:19.240 --> 25:24.240]  put up but they don't care they found a teenager and I bet the parents are
[25:24.240 --> 25:27.760]  saying look son do what they say the officers will take care of you yeah
[25:27.760 --> 25:34.160]  they'll take care of you and put you in prison look they don't care if 23.7
[25:34.160 --> 25:37.680]  trillion and our whole future has been stolen by offshore banks in the last 10
[25:37.680 --> 25:44.040]  months they don't care if the Gardasil shot is killing hundreds and hundreds of
[25:44.040 --> 25:48.840]  girls every month and maiming tens of thousands of others on record they don't
[25:48.840 --> 25:53.560]  care if the flu shot is giving people massive brain damage and killing large
[25:53.560 --> 26:02.240]  numbers in the trials sticking people in the ground is fine what's upsetting what
[26:02.240 --> 26:08.360]  what upsets the local bureaucrats is somebody daring to thumb their nose at
[26:08.360 --> 26:14.520]  Caesar you got all these ninnies going it's the law it's the law we've got to
[26:14.520 --> 26:21.000]  stand up for the law when they flaunt all the big serious hardcore laws I mean
[26:21.000 --> 26:26.400]  Florida's the worst state in the country for CPS kidnapping children and then
[26:26.400 --> 26:31.200]  being caught raping them hundreds and hundreds of articles all over Florida
[26:31.200 --> 26:38.360]  news thousands over 3500 missing last time I checked CNN a giant pedophile

[33:36.720 --> 33:40.920]  exactly what we've been warning everybody about I saw governor Ridge back
[33:40.920 --> 33:45.440]  in 2002 right as homeland security was becoming a cabinet position and taking
[33:45.440 --> 33:49.800]  over all the federal agencies he said to have a job you're gonna have to be in
[33:49.800 --> 33:55.440]  good stead with homeland security you're gonna have a worker card so when you
[33:55.440 --> 33:59.000]  hear about giving the illegal aliens amnesty and a worker visa that's
[33:59.000 --> 34:03.280]  actually for everybody in North America we told you back then they were gonna
[34:03.280 --> 34:07.360]  have a hemispheric travel work card that's the new North American
[34:07.360 --> 34:13.600]  hemisphere ID that the feds offered and see you're gonna need that to get on a
[34:13.600 --> 34:18.840]  plane that's that's that's the real ID card not just the state cards there
[34:18.840 --> 34:25.440]  they're clones of it you see that's the deal with cashless money or cashless
[34:25.440 --> 34:29.640]  systems or digital systems you can have multiple forms that's what they're
[34:29.640 --> 34:34.040]  talking about your your cell phone being registered to you and with an access
[34:34.040 --> 34:39.680]  code to your GPS triangulation software that being used as a purchasing
[34:39.680 --> 34:44.320]  system everything is being designed to track and trace and control and monitor
[34:44.320 --> 34:48.960]  and chronicle your entire life's actions kind of like a book of life the
[34:48.960 --> 34:54.040]  new order is counterfeiting that where they're creating an artificial book or
[34:54.040 --> 35:00.160]  or record of your life I mean people hundreds of years ago would read about
[35:00.160 --> 35:04.680]  which are angel is it's you know supposedly when you go up before God
[35:04.680 --> 35:09.200]  that has the book and everything you've done in it the book of life and you know
[35:09.200 --> 35:14.720]  St. Michael or is it St. Michael at the gates flipping through it and everything
[35:14.720 --> 35:17.920]  you've done here it is there it is imagine how that sounded to people a
[35:17.920 --> 35:22.560]  thousand years ago sounded pretty wild now that's what the government's already
[35:22.560 --> 35:27.520]  doing but see they can put what they want in that book and there's no judge
[35:27.520 --> 35:33.200]  there's no jury your guilty period not guilty until proven innocent and there's
[35:33.200 --> 35:38.560]  a million two hundred thousand Americans on the list but for a year they haven't
[35:38.560 --> 35:45.560]  been adding the new names publicly so it's probably more like one million
[35:45.560 --> 35:48.960]  three hundred something thousand because they're at twenty five thousand plus names
[35:48.960 --> 35:53.400]  a month so you do the math there what's a lot more than that it's probably a
[35:53.400 --> 35:58.200]  million and a half now or so but you just show up and they say sorry you can't
[35:58.200 --> 36:07.680]  fly they never can again think about that and there's that intimidation oh you
[36:07.680 --> 36:14.640]  better not criticize the government or you end up on a no-fly list I was
[36:14.640 --> 36:18.680]  talking to governor Jesse Ventura yesterday was he was interviewing me
[36:18.680 --> 36:24.720]  for his TV show I'm gonna be in multiple parts of it and I'm consulting some on
[36:24.720 --> 36:33.240]  it and then I interviewed him afterwards I'm gonna post some of that
[36:33.240 --> 36:39.480]  interview I'm more of it's gonna come out in time but he talked about how they
[36:39.480 --> 36:46.720]  flew Daniel Estolin to New York to be interviewed for the show and Jesse had
[36:46.720 --> 36:50.880]  to stay in New York an extra day because Estolin was on the no-fly list and had
[36:50.880 --> 36:56.720]  to go through a bunch of hell to get to the United States and this is gonna be
[36:56.720 --> 37:00.480]  for your jobs that's why they're saying you'll be on the no-fly list if you have
[37:00.480 --> 37:04.320]  bad credit but that no-fly list then becomes a no-buy list for owning
[37:04.320 --> 37:07.520]  firearms that's already been announced by the White House and again I told you
[37:07.520 --> 37:11.120]  this years ago not because I'm smart once you know their game you understand
[37:11.120 --> 37:18.120]  what did Hitler do with Jews he said first well you've just got to wear this
[37:18.120 --> 37:21.400]  star so we know who you are but it's for your safety because we have special
[37:21.400 --> 37:24.880]  places for you on the trains and special places for you and then oh yeah
[37:24.880 --> 37:28.640]  you're not allowed to have your business open anymore without authorization
[37:28.640 --> 37:32.720]  you're not allowed to travel you know first you just got to show your papers
[37:32.720 --> 37:36.120]  they get you trained showing your papers and then oh well we don't let some of
[37:36.120 --> 37:39.320]  you travel and then well we don't let any of you travel and well now you can't
[37:39.320 --> 37:42.520]  have your business well now you can't pay your taxes and you're living in your
[37:42.520 --> 37:45.560]  neighborhood we're just gonna make your whole neighborhood a present and then
[37:45.560 --> 37:48.800]  oh look you're starving of death and then oh look we're gonna take you to a
[37:48.800 --> 37:54.640]  camp where you'll be safe since you're homeless now that's exactly what FEMA's
[37:54.640 --> 37:58.880]  now announcing with their camps this is the new economy oh you don't have money
[37:58.880 --> 38:03.080]  you can just work as a brown shirt for the government or if you are on the
[38:03.080 --> 38:07.200]  wrong side of that you're gonna be somebody in the camp and they're gonna
[38:07.200 --> 38:10.800]  take you out to mow government lawns and they're gonna take you out to clean
[38:10.800 --> 38:14.720]  elitist houses and then bust you back and search you before you go back into
[38:14.720 --> 38:22.720]  the camp at night because lazy pot-bellied control freaks need jobs and
[38:22.720 --> 38:27.360]  their job is gonna be beating your skull in with a night stick and raping your
[38:27.360 --> 38:32.880]  daughter right before they get you in a ditch and blow your head off and you're
[38:32.880 --> 38:37.880]  gonna love it when they do it I know I know you love drinking the fluoride and
[38:37.880 --> 38:48.080]  love taking the shots and love sucking your thumbs oh man I'm not talking about
[38:48.080 --> 38:50.400]  our listeners I'm talking about new listeners people I think this is all
[38:50.400 --> 38:56.600]  funny by the way coming up next hour just pull up battle for the republic the
[38:56.600 --> 39:00.920]  extras from in game I want to show people illegal aliens allowed to
[39:00.920 --> 39:06.040]  demonstrate in Seattle but if a citizen demonstrates in any way the police
[39:06.040 --> 39:09.800]  come and slam his head in the ground blood's pouring out and the police have
[39:09.800 --> 39:14.280]  a celebration with the illegal aliens and give them high fives that they've
[39:14.280 --> 39:22.000]  attacked American citizen and beat them up hold him out of his car and then of
[39:22.000 --> 39:26.520]  course I went and protested for sent a fox then they had a Cinco de Mayo was it
[39:26.520 --> 39:35.080]  four years ago and the leader of the group said I dare any of the anti
[39:35.080 --> 39:38.600]  immigration people to come out to this event will will beat you up so I said
[39:38.600 --> 39:42.880]  well I'm gonna go and I was out there with about 25 other people that came out
[39:42.880 --> 39:47.880]  with me and I went right up to the crowd of people and I said go ahead attack me
[39:47.880 --> 39:58.200]  that happened in this little Texas town we're gonna be playing coming up and it's
[39:58.200 --> 40:01.720]  just so incredible folks I mean people with Mexican flags trying to pull down
[40:01.720 --> 40:06.160]  American flags coming up and saying come on gringo let's have a fight we
[40:06.160 --> 40:10.080]  outnumber you we're gonna kick you out of the country and then and then and then
[40:10.080 --> 40:14.920]  we're just sit here's not supposed to take that as a threat and see I don't
[40:14.920 --> 40:20.280]  want to play into the elites plan I don't want to get into a racial fight but
[40:20.280 --> 40:24.560]  when it's coming at you racially and the media is always gonna say you're bad if
[40:24.560 --> 40:30.480]  you stand up for yourself the answer is Americans who want to save our sovereignty
[40:30.480 --> 40:33.480]  and understand the illegal aliens being used as a tool and a weapon to bring this
[40:33.480 --> 40:37.720]  country down we have to get together or there's no future and we have to get past
[40:37.720 --> 40:43.040]  the tribalism the racism and really get scientific about this and realize the
[40:43.040 --> 40:48.200]  mind game the establishments engaged in because the elite can't win if the
[40:48.200 --> 40:51.040]  people get together against the New World Order but if they play us off against
[40:51.040 --> 40:55.640]  black against white Hispanic against white old against young Catholic against
[40:55.640 --> 40:59.880]  Protestant Muslim against you they win and you notice that's what Cohen tell
[40:59.880 --> 41:05.800]  pro always does when they attack me is they just try to balkanize they got
[41:05.800 --> 41:08.560]  people attacking me saying I'm anti-Catholic they got people attacking
[41:08.560 --> 41:12.200]  me saying I'm some secret Catholic agent they got people attacking me saying I
[41:12.200 --> 41:15.960]  work for Israel they got people attacking me saying I'm anti-Semitic they got
[41:15.960 --> 41:20.400]  people attacking me on every issue you can imagine all based on false
[41:20.400 --> 41:24.600]  distortions or disinfo but it doesn't matter it's a background noise of
[41:24.600 --> 41:29.280]  confusion and infighting that we see in the declassified FBI documents in
[41:29.280 --> 41:37.920]  Cohen tell pro and operation chaos and I told you years ago that how Turner was
[41:37.920 --> 41:44.120]  an FBI informant I mean you could look at how Turner and just his MO and the way
[41:44.120 --> 41:52.320]  behaved and what he did and you could look and how he got away with things that
[41:52.320 --> 41:56.320]  nobody else could ever get away with and how he was always putting out false
[41:56.320 --> 42:05.200]  info on purpose like other people do and it's now come out in federal court the
[42:05.200 --> 42:08.160]  FBI admits well he wasn't informed but we're not going to say how much and
[42:08.160 --> 42:13.600]  how Turner is now saying Associated Press that he was a provocateur for the
[42:13.600 --> 42:18.200]  FBI agent provocateurs the word well I mean I have stacks of news where every
[42:18.200 --> 42:23.520]  other major clan rally or meeting or these the militia groups that McVay was
[42:23.520 --> 42:27.800]  involved in let's say militias themselves the militia groups the fake ones
[42:27.800 --> 42:31.640]  they create to demonize militias are total feds I mean I covered that a few
[42:31.640 --> 42:39.000]  days ago just huge stacks of admissions I would say 98% of white
[42:39.000 --> 42:49.880]  supremacist groups are founded and commanded and led by feds 98% and it
[42:49.880 --> 42:53.760]  is sick I said I'm taking your calls let's do it Stuart and Mass you're on
[42:53.760 --> 43:02.560]  the air yeah good afternoon welcome um I wanted to highlight a point that you
[43:02.560 --> 43:06.720]  talk about sometimes that I think is pretty crucial to in order to have a
[43:06.720 --> 43:12.680]  peaceful revolution and I find that like um a lot of the kids nowadays like you
[43:12.680 --> 43:17.360]  know how you talk about how we're about true rebellions not dressing like dying
[43:17.360 --> 43:21.680]  your hair and having tattoos and piercings it's about going down the
[43:21.680 --> 43:26.560]  city hall and fighting city hall dressed up nice and well I'm not saying
[43:26.560 --> 43:30.680]  people are bad that have piercings and tattoos and cool hair or whatever and
[43:30.680 --> 43:35.360]  people always misinterpret what I'm saying if if people do that to say to
[43:35.360 --> 43:40.080]  the rest of the world it's uptight and in a box I'm different and then it's just
[43:40.080 --> 43:45.840]  a manifestation of their own style and art that's great I'm saying that some of
[43:45.840 --> 43:51.280]  the most close-minded people out there are basically people that just get a
[43:51.280 --> 43:57.520]  tattoo or a green mohawk and then just sit back going man I'm so cool and I'm
[43:57.520 --> 44:01.920]  saying no it's cool to live a good life to be strong to help others and to be
[44:01.920 --> 44:06.760]  involved and informed go ahead yeah I'm agreeing with you there but I find that
[44:06.760 --> 44:10.640]  a lot of them are actually in my knuckle of the woods up here are the most
[44:10.640 --> 44:16.120]  receptive though because they're already rebellious in some way a peaceful way it's
[44:16.120 --> 44:19.560]  just not the right right way because they're not informed and they still
[44:19.560 --> 44:24.280]  they're blindsided by a lot of issues I was too when I was younger and like but
[44:24.280 --> 44:30.000]  they're very receptive you know I mean is there gonna look like hell when you
[44:30.000 --> 44:35.320]  get old no I mean either I got a couple but and I just think that's really
[44:35.320 --> 44:37.880]  important because they're really receptive this kid I know he's a punk
[44:37.880 --> 44:41.960]  he's very intelligent though you know I talked to him recently I ran into him I
[44:41.960 --> 44:45.640]  hadn't seen about a lot of these issues and then when he was like yeah well
[44:45.640 --> 44:48.800]  what do you do about it I was like you get dressed up nice and you go down the
[44:48.800 --> 44:53.240]  city hall and you let him know you know you pick an issue an important one it's
[44:53.240 --> 44:58.080]  kind of tough to bring up national issues at City Hall but I mean to make to
[44:58.080 --> 45:02.160]  relate it to your town you know what I'm saying especially in a small town where a
[45:02.160 --> 45:06.440]  lot of that it might be going on but it's behind closed doors so you have to be
[45:06.440 --> 45:11.880]  very articulate and relate it to how it's gonna absolutely good to hear from
[45:11.880 --> 45:15.600]  you good to hear from you I appreciate the fine points you've made look when
[45:15.600 --> 45:19.080]  you don't have to be perfectly dressed or have all the answers or even get it
[45:19.080 --> 45:22.560]  all right I don't want people to think they've got to be so perfect about this
[45:22.560 --> 45:27.120]  they don't go down the city hall I'm just setting out the best example in my
[45:27.120 --> 45:31.640]  mind doesn't mean I live up to it the main thing is action take action get
[45:31.640 --> 45:36.360]  involved down with the New World Order down with the eugenics cult down with
[45:36.360 --> 45:41.680]  the one world government that's it just get in there and start swinging and look
[45:41.680 --> 45:46.880]  I don't my point is I don't care what you look like I think people in perfectly
[45:46.880 --> 45:50.760]  tailored suits all preening and strutting around and looking down on
[45:50.760 --> 45:56.800]  others that aren't dressed nice that's a form of dress up a form of costume a
[45:56.800 --> 46:00.660]  but that's what we do as a species we're similar to birds you know like our
[46:00.660 --> 46:06.720]  flashy colors and flap their feathers out and wave it at the mate that's part of
[46:06.720 --> 46:12.320]  being human I'm just saying don't let that become everything you are don't
[46:12.320 --> 46:19.400]  let that become your entire being I totally understand getting a tattoo if
[46:19.400 --> 46:22.920]  you're in the military and you know some special campaign or whatever and you
[46:22.920 --> 46:27.240]  get a few tattoos over the years at different rites of passage it's like
[46:27.240 --> 46:34.560]  getting an earring when you pass the equator or whatever with sailors all of
[46:34.560 --> 46:39.560]  that is very human I'm not even judging I don't even care the point is I don't
[46:39.560 --> 46:46.920]  like being judged by people because I have short haircut and I'm clean cut I
[46:46.920 --> 46:49.560]  got short hair because I've come it straight back when it's wet in the
[46:49.560 --> 46:53.160]  morning and it falls like it does and I brush my teeth and that's the end of it
[46:53.160 --> 46:58.080]  put the other under my arms so it takes me three minutes instead of you know an
[46:58.080 --> 47:03.200]  hour to put up a blue mohawk I mean I got stuff to do folks I don't have
[47:03.200 --> 47:07.880]  tattoos on my body because I guess growing up I looked at how many old
[47:07.880 --> 47:12.360]  vets and stuff I knew where it was just like these big ugly smudges all over
[47:12.360 --> 47:20.240]  them you know again we go off in the side issues I now I just went to a water
[47:20.240 --> 47:22.920]  park last week and I told everybody about that I just couldn't believe the
[47:22.920 --> 47:27.960]  number of tattoos it was rare to see somebody that didn't have tattoos and I
[47:27.960 --> 47:34.600]  mean big ones all over and on their faces and I was just like what are these
[47:34.600 --> 47:41.200]  old people gonna look like I mean it's gonna look like hell and that's all I'm
[47:41.200 --> 47:47.160]  saying I don't care do what you want it's just that I don't even matter
[47:47.160 --> 47:51.000]  they're putting poison in the water supply they're spraying chemtrails on
[47:51.000 --> 47:56.280]  us and all I'm saying is we got to do something folks it's now coming out
[47:56.280 --> 48:03.680]  blackwater with the Cheney hit teams rape rooms I just you just you just you
[48:03.680 --> 48:08.000]  just can't believe there's just many bad people I just can't believe how evil
[48:08.000 --> 48:14.400]  this country is Donna in Ohio you're on the air
[48:14.400 --> 48:20.040]  Alex they had a tea party up here there's a couple things I want to talk
[48:20.040 --> 48:25.760]  about they had a tea party up here over 7,000 people went to it and the routing
[48:25.760 --> 48:30.400]  was so blocked up that the people that wanted to go I don't know what was
[48:30.400 --> 48:37.360]  going on but anyways they had it and I heard it on the radio and boy was it
[48:37.360 --> 48:42.160]  exciting it was everything that you pretty much cover and they had that
[48:42.160 --> 48:49.120]  also I have a fan that would be good for a t-shirt and somebody said this there
[48:49.120 --> 48:54.560]  and I thought wow that was really great it was I wasn't born in a communist
[48:54.560 --> 49:00.840]  country and I won't die in one and either will my grandchildren what do you
[49:00.840 --> 49:05.520]  think about that I think it's a great t-shirt I wasn't born in a communist
[49:05.520 --> 49:11.440]  country and I'm not gonna die in one either will my grandchildren well the
[49:11.440 --> 49:15.600]  problem is I'm noticing all over the country that it's the illegal aliens
[49:15.600 --> 49:20.440]  more and more are the army of the government as we predicted notice they're
[49:20.440 --> 49:24.680]  making the military up of the illegal aliens the rest of it so I don't know
[49:24.680 --> 49:31.200]  if you've seen this video out of Trinity Texas and I don't even know if we can
[49:31.200 --> 49:35.280]  play it there's so many cuss words we're trying to find just a few clips where
[49:35.280 --> 49:41.760]  there aren't cuss words but it is illegal aliens and I guess citizens as
[49:41.760 --> 49:49.680]  well coming up and acting like the site of the American flag is is hell on earth
[49:49.680 --> 49:56.240]  and I guess there's more than 14 South Texas towns that fly the Mexican flag
[49:56.240 --> 50:01.640]  and not the American or Texan you know what else and eat those made national
[50:01.640 --> 50:06.240]  lives go ahead you know what it says in the Bible here you're supposed to warn
[50:06.240 --> 50:11.640]  these devil possessed people they better straighten out and turn from their evil
[50:11.640 --> 50:18.480]  ways because I believe God is getting pretty fed up with all this child like
[50:18.480 --> 50:23.040]  you say you know they're taking the children away from the parents I don't
[50:23.040 --> 50:29.680]  think I was gonna put up with it too much in Ezekiel 3 it's in 17 you know it
[50:29.680 --> 50:35.960]  starts at 17 and it says to warn them because if we don't warn them then the
[50:35.960 --> 50:42.800]  their blood will be on our hands but also I want you to read Psalm 35 it's a
[50:42.800 --> 50:48.120]  protection like a protection prayer and then 109 Psalms 109 and that will be
[50:48.120 --> 50:54.880]  something that I say every night God bless you thank you Donna Cody Gary

[54:43.520 --> 54:52.960]  prismplanet.tv Cody in Washington your on the air Cody welcome oh yes hello
[54:52.960 --> 54:57.880]  Alex thanks for taking my call I've been a listener of yours for years now the
[54:57.880 --> 55:03.160]  reason I called is because I heard a conversation that you had with a friend
[55:03.160 --> 55:08.120]  of mine he taped it and I didn't know that you actually agreed with and I
[55:08.120 --> 55:14.120]  appreciate your call it's just amazing how these people all sit there and are
[55:14.120 --> 55:21.680]  just constantly going after my show let's go ahead and take another call here
[55:21.680 --> 55:27.480]  the feds are very very upset about this radio show right now it's like Hal
[55:27.480 --> 55:37.080]  Turner FBI trained New Jersey blogger to incite others a New Jersey blogger
[55:37.080 --> 55:41.160]  facing charges in two states for allegedly making threats against
[55:41.160 --> 55:48.560]  lawmakers and judges was trained by the FBI on how to be deliberately
[55:48.560 --> 55:54.960]  provocative his attorney said Tuesday Hal Turner worked for the FBI from 2002
[55:54.960 --> 56:03.080]  to 2007 as an agent provocateur and was taught by the agency what he could say
[56:03.080 --> 56:09.240]  that wouldn't be crossing the line defense attorney Michael what's this
[56:09.240 --> 56:18.440]  word o r oz co said his job was basically to publish information which
[56:18.440 --> 56:24.560]  would cause other parties to act in a manner which would lead to their arrest
[56:24.560 --> 56:30.440]  prosecutors have acknowledged that Turner was an informant who spied on
[56:30.440 --> 56:35.120]  radical right-wing organizations but the defense has said Turner was not
[56:35.120 --> 56:39.000]  working for the FBI when he allegedly made threats against Connecticut
[56:39.000 --> 56:48.440]  legislators and wrote that three federal judges in Illinois deserve to die but if
[56:48.440 --> 56:53.040]  you compare anything that he said when he was operating there was no difference
[56:53.040 --> 56:59.320]  no difference whatsoever special agent Ross Rice a spokesman for the FBI in
[56:59.320 --> 57:05.840]  Chicago said he would not comment on or even confirm Turner's relationship with
[57:05.840 --> 57:15.560]  the FBI so I've always made it clear on air that I don't support what Zionism
[57:15.560 --> 57:18.960]  does the popular Zionism we know as what Israel is there's some different
[57:18.960 --> 57:24.120]  variants of it any more than I support the Ku Klux Klan or I support Mecha and
[57:24.120 --> 57:28.600]  La Raza that we were just talking about calling for racial hatred and racial
[57:28.600 --> 57:33.520]  division and all this and I believe Israel has a double standard on a lot of
[57:33.520 --> 57:39.800]  issues and I've made films about it but because I'm not a Nazi the white
[57:39.800 --> 57:46.000]  supremacist groups and people don't like me because I don't hate Jews for being
[57:46.000 --> 57:51.360]  Jews then I'm bad and a lot of these groups in the past oh we're not anti
[57:51.360 --> 57:59.640]  Semitic we're just anti Zionist and then they just come right out and say no
[57:59.640 --> 58:06.880]  it's Jews we don't like all Jews are bad basically and I happen to know and it's
[58:06.880 --> 58:11.960]  come out thousands of times that most of these groups are run and handled and
[58:11.960 --> 58:22.600]  controlled by the feds that's exactly what I've been talking about is how we
[58:22.600 --> 58:28.640]  have to stand up against the global government and not make it a racial or
[58:28.640 --> 58:34.520]  religious issue or the controllers win we'll be right back with more polls

[1:00:07.520 --> 1:00:16.000]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[1:00:16.000 --> 1:00:31.440]  we are continuing with open phones throughout the radio show today
[1:00:31.440 --> 1:00:38.320]  remember the fellow out in Arizona with the AR-15 strapped to his back well
[1:00:38.320 --> 1:00:42.320]  he's gonna be on the show he's refused to do big mainstream media interviews but
[1:00:42.320 --> 1:00:48.040]  he's a listener and contacted us and we're excited about having him on talking
[1:00:48.040 --> 1:00:53.640]  about open carry and why he did it in his political views and also Oberman is
[1:00:53.640 --> 1:00:58.080]  now trying to demonize him and tie him into McVeigh yeah the white
[1:00:58.080 --> 1:01:02.080]  supremacist he's a black guy and you know militias or white supremacist and
[1:01:02.080 --> 1:01:08.160]  all this which is what the feds want they don't want blacks and whites and
[1:01:08.160 --> 1:01:11.360]  Hispanics and Asians working together for liberty and freedom and living in
[1:01:11.360 --> 1:01:17.000]  peace they all want to make it tribal because if you make it tribal then the
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:19.760]  blacks will stay in their group and can be controlled by their racial leaders
[1:01:19.760 --> 1:01:24.160]  the Jews will stay in their group and can be trolled by their racial leaders the
[1:01:24.160 --> 1:01:28.840]  Chinese will be racial and they'll stay in their racial groups and then all
[1:01:28.840 --> 1:01:33.080]  just the Hispanics that's that's how this thing works and I said I would get
[1:01:33.080 --> 1:01:36.240]  into that the start of the show and I am coming up later in the hour it's just
[1:01:36.240 --> 1:01:40.960]  there's so much cussing on this video from Texas that we've got a few select
[1:01:40.960 --> 1:01:45.360]  clips we can play from the YouTube video that's up on info wars.com and
[1:01:45.360 --> 1:01:50.960]  prisonplanet.com of the illegal aliens just going absolutely wild are they
[1:01:50.960 --> 1:01:55.840]  maybe citizens I don't know I just it's really scary really really scary this
[1:01:55.840 --> 1:02:02.080]  this this type of vulcanization this is a town hall meeting and and all over the
[1:02:02.080 --> 1:02:05.880]  country the the the pro-Obama people beat you up they attack you then the
[1:02:05.880 --> 1:02:11.160]  media says you're bad but you notice if somebody got an AR-15 strapped to their
[1:02:11.160 --> 1:02:14.600]  back you're not going to see these guys doing that so the second of them it's
[1:02:14.600 --> 1:02:19.280]  for to protect us from dangerous mobs this didn't like Mexico where we're
[1:02:19.280 --> 1:02:24.360]  totally enslaved and the government's the only ones that have the weapons okay
[1:02:24.360 --> 1:02:29.120]  who's up next Garrett in Mississippi Garrett you're on the air hello Alex
[1:02:29.120 --> 1:02:36.920]  hi if you want if you don't mind let's talk about malicious yes I've been a
[1:02:36.920 --> 1:02:42.080]  member for 10 years since I was in college and talking to you on the radio
[1:02:42.080 --> 1:02:47.600]  etc and with your permission I'd like to offer some websites for some legitimate
[1:02:47.600 --> 1:02:53.560]  unorganized citizens malicious that people can reach out to that's not not
[1:02:53.560 --> 1:02:59.560]  anything that's fair control what you know they're they're not fed controlled
[1:02:59.560 --> 1:03:06.520]  I I know these folks that you know and they they do their homework and our
[1:03:06.520 --> 1:03:10.680]  groups in Mississippi we do background checks and we have a procedure oh that
[1:03:10.680 --> 1:03:15.760]  sounds good what are the groups alright for Mississippi folks can reach us at
[1:03:15.760 --> 1:03:24.360]  Mississippi militia dot US and nationwide there is a organization awrm.org
[1:03:24.360 --> 1:03:29.600]  well regulated militia dot org is a discussion forum but there's contacts you
[1:03:29.600 --> 1:03:34.720]  know I know most these folks from multi-state meetings and such and the
[1:03:34.720 --> 1:03:41.720]  people run that run it they run a tight ship and we're not all bad you know we
[1:03:41.720 --> 1:03:46.280]  get folks come out to two meetings and then they'd make a choice if it's good
[1:03:46.280 --> 1:03:51.400]  for them they're good for us and you know we've let some folks go and as far as
[1:03:51.400 --> 1:03:54.840]  being white supremacist or whatever we've we've got several black folks that
[1:03:54.840 --> 1:03:59.600]  are you know no no I understand that I see see I see this is why this gets so
[1:03:59.600 --> 1:04:05.200]  confusing I can't even be clear and maybe I'm not a good communicator the
[1:04:05.200 --> 1:04:11.800]  militias aren't white supremacist the media says white supremacist and then
[1:04:11.800 --> 1:04:16.160]  says the word militia and then says the word gun owner and then says the word
[1:04:16.160 --> 1:04:21.760]  veteran thus by starting with the term white supremacist Tim McVeigh which is
[1:04:21.760 --> 1:04:28.540]  a federal agent that's been proven in federal documents then by extension by
[1:04:28.540 --> 1:04:32.960]  guilt by association they then demonize a militia then they demonize the second
[1:04:32.960 --> 1:04:38.600]  amendment then they demonize the veterans that's what the DHS report does
[1:04:38.600 --> 1:04:44.560]  yes I'm not saying militias are bad but see Cointel pro goes out distorts when
[1:04:44.560 --> 1:04:48.320]  I'm saying and says look Alex is saying the militias are bad militias he doesn't
[1:04:48.320 --> 1:04:53.320]  like you that is I'm saying the opposite I'm saying people got to watch out when

[1:09:39.400 --> 1:09:43.200]  out so why should they care or if that's not really in the Bible but you can't
[1:09:43.200 --> 1:09:50.240]  explain that to them you know why stand up for the 50 plus million babies that
[1:09:50.240 --> 1:09:54.360]  have been aborted because you're about to be teleported out of here right just
[1:09:54.360 --> 1:10:03.000]  amazing piece of news that congressman Grassley saying FCC diversity chief may
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:07.240]  stifle talk radio well yeah we've had a whole bunch of senators introduce
[1:10:07.240 --> 1:10:12.160]  legislation that says they're gonna in free speech on talk radio and the
[1:10:12.160 --> 1:10:17.560]  internet and the FCC saying with these new bills they want FCC control over
[1:10:17.560 --> 1:10:22.280]  the internet and the licensed bloggers and I have a news story here about a
[1:10:22.280 --> 1:10:26.400]  mother arrested for criticizing the police raids in their neighborhood
[1:10:26.400 --> 1:10:30.160]  arrested for her blog and they say you're not allowed to have free speech
[1:10:30.160 --> 1:10:42.720]  that's in America I've got that here in the stack as well also Barack Obama
[1:10:42.720 --> 1:10:49.000]  critics are taking aim now at the carbon reforms that's also here in the news so
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:53.480]  so you notice people are learning they have political power if they'll just
[1:10:53.480 --> 1:10:59.200]  take action now they're going after the rest of the big globalist agenda that's
[1:10:59.200 --> 1:11:03.920]  very very exciting inspired by the success of protest against health care
[1:11:03.920 --> 1:11:08.240]  reform the critics began their fight against the carbon scheme with a
[1:11:08.240 --> 1:11:13.120]  rally in houston texas several right-wing groups oppose what they see is
[1:11:13.120 --> 1:11:18.040]  mr. Obama's tendency towards big government are involved in both campaigns
[1:11:18.040 --> 1:11:22.720]  and hope to defeat or emasculate the two central pillars of the president's
[1:11:22.720 --> 1:11:33.480]  domestic agenda so we're going to be going over that report also I have this
[1:11:33.480 --> 1:11:43.240]  another Fox news story that links to info wars.com I have an ABC news story
[1:11:43.240 --> 1:11:49.960]  that shows our Obama fascist posters up all over Chicago and they don't give us
[1:11:49.960 --> 1:11:54.280]  any credit on ABC or whoever put them up they say that it's the local
[1:11:54.280 --> 1:12:04.680]  Palestinian who originally photoshopped a progenitor of the Obama poster he in
[1:12:04.680 --> 1:12:13.360]  a photoshop I think he said contest or game he he was online I saw news because
[1:12:13.360 --> 1:12:17.120]  I think he said on Facebook there was like some unofficial contest where they
[1:12:17.120 --> 1:12:20.720]  were doing photoshop and he just threw it up there and somebody took it
[1:12:20.720 --> 1:12:32.040]  altered it added socialism to it the point is is that the news is now showing
[1:12:32.040 --> 1:12:36.680]  the fascist posters and the info wars posters and saying that he's the guy
[1:12:36.680 --> 1:12:40.480]  that basically put the poster out and that it's almost like it's his fault
[1:12:40.480 --> 1:12:46.960]  like it's something bad and the Chicago ABC news piece is is is is just really
[1:12:46.960 --> 1:12:50.960]  sickening maybe we'll play it later if we have time and they go to this
[1:12:50.960 --> 1:12:55.720]  Palestinian America and he apologizes and apologizes for the poster and says
[1:12:55.720 --> 1:12:59.280]  it's wrong and people shouldn't criticize the president he likes the
[1:12:59.280 --> 1:13:07.800]  president and so it's almost like they go get a false confession from somebody
[1:13:07.800 --> 1:13:13.560]  who isn't even involved to say look even the person that did it is saying he's
[1:13:13.560 --> 1:13:20.360]  sorry to the president so the average person watching this would would believe
[1:13:20.360 --> 1:13:26.760]  that but the issue here is felony vandalism charges possible in Obama
[1:13:26.760 --> 1:13:32.880]  poster case of Florida teenager could find himself in a sticky situation as a
[1:13:32.880 --> 1:13:38.400]  state attorney prepares to review possible felony vandalism charges in
[1:13:38.400 --> 1:13:44.760]  connection to the posters depicting President Obama as the Joker a Florida
[1:13:44.760 --> 1:13:50.120]  teenager could face felony vandalism charges for allegedly going posters
[1:13:50.120 --> 1:13:57.960]  depicting President Obama as the Joker on the public property and it goes on
[1:13:57.960 --> 1:14:03.000]  Claremount Florida police captain Eric Jensen said the state attorney will
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:07.960]  review evidence to determine whether or not to charge the unidentified teenager
[1:14:07.960 --> 1:14:18.320]  with gluing dozens of the posters last week to city light poles public and
[1:14:18.320 --> 1:14:25.360]  private buildings bridge overpasses road signs and a mailbox Jensen said damage
[1:14:25.360 --> 1:14:30.440]  the city property exceed $800 and it costs roughly 200 to remove the adhesive
[1:14:30.440 --> 1:14:34.720]  that was used to affix the poster on the mailbox if he hadn't glued them we
[1:14:34.720 --> 1:14:42.220]  wouldn't be having this discussion Jensen told Fox News if convicted of
[1:14:42.220 --> 1:14:46.520]  felony vandalism the teenager could face a maximum of five years in jail no
[1:14:46.520 --> 1:14:51.720]  arrest have been made yet in the case Bill Gladson of the Florida's Fifth
[1:14:51.720 --> 1:14:56.520]  Circuit Judicial Court which oversees Lake County confirmed that state attorney
[1:14:56.520 --> 1:15:02.520]  Brad King will receive the case as early as Wednesday this came out Tuesday we
[1:15:02.520 --> 1:15:07.560]  look at every case that gets dropped off he said declining further comment until
[1:15:07.560 --> 1:15:13.560]  the case was filed is received Gladson said he could not recall a recent case
[1:15:13.560 --> 1:15:18.600]  involving potential charges of felony vandalism in regard to posters including
[1:15:18.600 --> 1:15:25.160]  those pertaining to political messages and they have the ACLU in here saying
[1:15:25.160 --> 1:15:30.200]  well this is a property issue so it's not protected by the First Amendment
[1:15:30.200 --> 1:15:35.360]  ladies and gentlemen the point is is that it's selective enforcement because
[1:15:35.360 --> 1:15:39.360]  there's other posters of everything else you can imagine including pro Obama
[1:15:39.360 --> 1:15:44.320]  posters stuck directly on stop signs now we told people from day one and the
[1:15:44.320 --> 1:15:49.080]  rules and on the radio stick it where posters are commonly put up and you saw
[1:15:49.080 --> 1:15:55.160]  me go out I stuck them up where I saw other garage sale signs that were been
[1:15:55.160 --> 1:16:00.680]  hanging there for weeks I went and hung it on things like that we went and put
[1:16:00.680 --> 1:16:04.000]  them up on South Congress where there were other handbills we put them up
[1:16:04.000 --> 1:16:10.600]  over other people's as just customary now I guess they could try to nickel and
[1:16:10.600 --> 1:16:15.920]  dime and say oh well some cities have ordinances or not but I mean you don't
[1:16:15.920 --> 1:16:19.440]  go out and arrest the local rock band for putting up 100 posters you don't go
[1:16:19.440 --> 1:16:23.440]  out and arrest people putting pro Obama posters that are all over Austin for the
[1:16:23.440 --> 1:16:27.240]  last year and a half I mean right during the election up until the election
[1:16:27.240 --> 1:16:32.840]  almost every light pole in town and stop signs had Obama stuck on them I mean
[1:16:32.840 --> 1:16:39.000]  did you hear ninnying and freaking out and hand wringing and people all being
[1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:51.280]  scared to death concerning things like this no you didn't see him saying a
[1:16:51.280 --> 1:16:54.880]  rest whoever put up the Obama posters that were pro Obama you didn't hear
[1:16:54.880 --> 1:16:59.720]  talking about victims and oh the police are interviewing victims that they were
[1:16:59.720 --> 1:17:04.240]  victimized by seeing it on a light pole they were victimized by seeing it on a
[1:17:04.240 --> 1:17:09.120]  telephone pole and and we played the clips it's mean it's nasty it's scary
[1:17:09.120 --> 1:17:15.040]  you can't do it and national Spanish TV said I need to be arrested and that it's
[1:17:15.040 --> 1:17:19.600]  clearly racism because the president's brown and we don't like brown people and
[1:17:19.600 --> 1:17:24.760]  then national TV says you know that socialism's the new n-word I mean this
[1:17:24.760 --> 1:17:33.480]  is soviet mind control this is a huge chilling effect
[1:17:38.840 --> 1:17:48.360]  and I for one I'm just so completely sick of it and so what's happened their
[1:17:48.360 --> 1:17:53.840]  intimidation of people's first amendment has now blown up in their face the
[1:17:53.840 --> 1:17:58.080]  police were on the news a few days ago admitting yeah we took down hundreds of
[1:17:58.080 --> 1:18:03.280]  these around the city and hundreds more pop back up but and and and they have
[1:18:03.280 --> 1:18:10.800]  this instinct of of tyrants to go oppress and selectively enforce on some
[1:18:10.800 --> 1:18:17.960]  teenager because he talked to him we want the teenager to contact us send us
[1:18:17.960 --> 1:18:24.840]  emails call us send us an email at writers and info wars might be a good
[1:18:24.840 --> 1:18:30.160]  one to check show tips and info wars we'd like to have this young man on the
[1:18:30.160 --> 1:18:35.440]  radio I'd like to talk to him a lot of people want to support you the good
[1:18:35.440 --> 1:18:41.480]  news is on the newspapers and on the TV station reports on every one of them 90
[1:18:41.480 --> 1:18:50.760]  plus percent maybe one out of ten comments is against you putting the
[1:18:50.760 --> 1:18:56.800]  posters up nine out of ten and that's conservative it's probably more than
[1:18:56.800 --> 1:18:58.960]  that you know you can go look for yourselves it's amazing you'll see
[1:18:58.960 --> 1:19:02.680]  comment or comment or comment saying this is ridiculous this is selective
[1:19:02.680 --> 1:19:06.760]  enforcement why didn't people care about all the pro Obama signs I saw stuck on
[1:19:06.760 --> 1:19:11.800]  telephone polls and stop signs you know what's the big deal here why are they
[1:19:11.800 --> 1:19:15.400]  spending all their manpower on this and then you have the issue of Florida and
[1:19:15.400 --> 1:19:20.000]  all the corruption and drug dealing by government and the CPS kidnapping tens of
[1:19:20.000 --> 1:19:24.960]  thousands of kids thousands of them missing the bank stealing trillions not

[1:20:24.480 --> 1:20:32.160]  a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs that's fascism it's not about

[1:24:50.640 --> 1:24:53.680]  but the president can go on the washington post and say put them up on
[1:24:53.680 --> 1:24:58.240]  stop signs worship me and that's a okay
[1:24:58.240 --> 1:25:02.240]  and the ACLU says that's a okay that's how sick
[1:25:02.240 --> 1:25:09.520]  this system has gotten you know i mentioned uh that
[1:25:09.520 --> 1:25:13.600]  headline story about government permission will be required to travel
[1:25:13.600 --> 1:25:19.760]  do people realize what this is they've said that if you are on the no fly list
[1:25:19.760 --> 1:25:23.600]  no judge no jury no charges no facing your accuser
[1:25:23.600 --> 1:25:28.640]  that you will now not be able to own a gun or buy a gun
[1:25:28.640 --> 1:25:32.800]  they say you're not going to be able to have a job

[1:25:36.720 --> 1:25:42.800]  this is the new debtor's prison this is the new gulag this is the new way
[1:25:42.800 --> 1:25:46.240]  that the establishment wants to put people into these reservations
[1:25:46.240 --> 1:25:49.200]  that's the same thing the soviets did the nazis did
[1:25:49.200 --> 1:25:53.600]  mounted this it's a system they shut your economic system off first
[1:25:53.600 --> 1:25:57.040]  they destroy you economically it's like when the feds raid you
[1:25:57.040 --> 1:25:59.920]  and want to take you to court but don't really have a case they freeze all your
[1:25:59.920 --> 1:26:03.040]  accounts and grab all your equipment so you don't have any money to defend
[1:26:03.040 --> 1:26:06.640]  yourself that's what they're doing to society and then
[1:26:06.640 --> 1:26:09.680]  like i said yesterday i was talking to jesse ventura he said yeah i wonder if
[1:26:09.680 --> 1:26:14.240]  i'm going to get on a no fly list you know if we're doing this tv show
[1:26:14.240 --> 1:26:17.280]  and he said well i guess it's just something you got to do but there's
[1:26:17.280 --> 1:26:20.880]  that thought but see if you then give in through fear
[1:26:20.880 --> 1:26:24.720]  and don't stand up because you may be blacklisted i mean think mccarthy would
[1:26:24.720 --> 1:26:29.920]  keep you from getting a job and the left always talks about
[1:26:29.920 --> 1:26:35.280]  that all day but this is bipartisan this is homeland
[1:26:35.280 --> 1:26:40.000]  security engaged in blacklisting from flying from
[1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:43.360]  living from having a job from owning a gun
[1:26:43.360 --> 1:26:47.760]  this is the total end of habeas corpus end of due process end of everything i
[1:26:47.760 --> 1:26:52.720]  mean it's so big and even groups that you
[1:26:52.720 --> 1:26:56.560]  you know who are analyzing it i i respectfully think don't get one tenth
[1:26:56.560 --> 1:26:59.760]  of how bad it is this campaign for liberty article
[1:26:59.760 --> 1:27:06.400]  is a good one uh it's so but you know we've got it up on infowars.com but
[1:27:06.400 --> 1:27:10.880]  government permission will be required to travel starting this year americans
[1:27:10.880 --> 1:27:14.080]  will have to get government approval to travel by air
[1:27:14.080 --> 1:27:18.960]  as privacy journal revealed last fall henceforth permission will now be needed
[1:27:18.960 --> 1:27:22.480]  to travel in the united states that's from the government in quotes
[1:27:22.480 --> 1:27:25.440]  getting a reservation and checking in for air travel will soon require
[1:27:25.440 --> 1:27:28.960]  transportation security administration authorization see
[1:27:28.960 --> 1:27:33.200]  they're now extrajudicial judge jury and executioner
[1:27:33.200 --> 1:27:36.800]  and and and homeland security admits they're training people
[1:27:36.800 --> 1:27:45.440]  to accept all of this on the airlines and in those high security situations
[1:27:45.440 --> 1:27:51.280]  and then now it's on trains and buses and at checkpoints and oh the army's here
[1:27:51.280 --> 1:27:59.040]  at the checkpoint the marines are here at the checkpoint
[1:27:59.040 --> 1:28:05.360]  it's just our transformation into a total gulag is really happening
[1:28:05.360 --> 1:28:09.520]  that permission is by no means assured for example if your name matches a no
[1:28:09.520 --> 1:28:14.640]  fly list even mistakenly see they even advertise that oh it's
[1:28:14.640 --> 1:28:19.280]  a mistake but you still can't fly even setting the precedent there
[1:28:19.280 --> 1:28:22.560]  it isn't a mistake they politically are punishing people they admit that
[1:28:22.560 --> 1:28:27.120]  that's come out in federal court we have to say no to this
[1:28:27.120 --> 1:28:30.560]  the permission is by no means assured for example if your name matches a no
[1:28:30.560 --> 1:28:34.080]  fly list even mistakenly you can be denied the right to reserve a seat on
[1:28:34.080 --> 1:28:37.120]  a flight if your name is on a select e-list
[1:28:37.120 --> 1:28:40.320]  you and your possessions will be searched more thoroughly before you can
[1:28:40.320 --> 1:28:42.800]  board so see they also put you on her a
[1:28:42.800 --> 1:28:45.680]  harassment list and now a lot of police departments are
[1:28:45.680 --> 1:28:49.360]  dialing in to these different private databases
[1:28:49.360 --> 1:28:53.040]  more sophisticated than google kind of like a lexus nexus
[1:28:53.040 --> 1:28:58.960]  uh roiders search and they know everything about you
[1:29:00.080 --> 1:29:03.760]  and they have the face scanning cameras and the license plate cameras and then
[1:29:03.760 --> 1:29:07.280]  the feds are now coming in setting up these fusion centers which really
[1:29:07.280 --> 1:29:12.480]  federalize and then teach the police how to use all these tools
[1:29:12.480 --> 1:29:16.240]  again the government's massing all this technological
[1:29:16.240 --> 1:29:22.160]  spy and military system up they're building all this up while trying to
[1:29:22.160 --> 1:29:27.120]  then disarm us protecting air safety is essential
[1:29:27.120 --> 1:29:30.240]  but professional screening and airports already provides for it see
[1:29:30.240 --> 1:29:34.800]  it's kind of weak giving the tsa as an official agency the additional
[1:29:34.800 --> 1:29:38.160]  authority to decide who gets to go where reaches beyond safety
[1:29:38.160 --> 1:29:45.600]  and over extended governmental power well yeah it totally ends freedom
[1:29:45.600 --> 1:29:49.440]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[1:29:49.440 --> 1:29:54.720]  alex jones and the gcn radio network

[1:33:11.520 --> 1:33:15.360]  or do you feel the same
[1:33:15.360 --> 1:33:21.680]  will it make it easier on you now
[1:33:21.920 --> 1:33:29.040]  you got someone to blame you said one love
[1:33:29.040 --> 1:33:34.160]  one life when it's one need
[1:33:34.160 --> 1:33:38.640]  you see the globalists only have to hold the high ground
[1:33:38.640 --> 1:33:43.600]  science and technology and weapons systems and then using their sociology
[1:33:43.600 --> 1:33:48.160]  their psychology play us all off against each other
[1:33:48.160 --> 1:33:54.000]  vulcanize us along all these different racial and religious lines
[1:33:54.000 --> 1:33:57.680]  because that's how we're programmed tribally
[1:33:57.680 --> 1:34:00.800]  to you know defend our territory against neighbors
[1:34:00.800 --> 1:34:05.360]  and so we're in this primitive paradigm
[1:34:05.360 --> 1:34:14.400]  they're manipulating those inputs those those instincts those activities
[1:34:14.400 --> 1:34:18.480]  and i remember
[1:34:18.480 --> 1:34:23.200]  like i said earlier in the first hour
[1:34:23.200 --> 1:34:28.560]  being invited by the libertarian longhorns and the young conservatives
[1:34:28.560 --> 1:34:34.960]  to a texas independence day birthday celebration
[1:34:34.960 --> 1:34:42.080]  and i went down there to give a speech
[1:34:42.080 --> 1:34:48.000]  and folks showed up in aztec headdresses and
[1:34:48.000 --> 1:34:51.760]  ran up and grabbed the birthday cake crammed it in their mouths spit it back
[1:34:51.760 --> 1:34:55.840]  out on the cake uh a black guy came running up grabbed the
[1:34:55.840 --> 1:34:58.320]  microphone i didn't want to get in a fight with him i just gave it to him
[1:34:58.320 --> 1:35:03.120]  and said you're a racist and i said well that doesn't really
[1:35:03.120 --> 1:35:06.880]  i said to the guys and i'm pretty young i don't have a bunch of white guilt i
[1:35:06.880 --> 1:35:10.560]  i didn't grow up when people drank out of different water fountains and stuff
[1:35:10.560 --> 1:35:15.280]  i you know i said i really uh don't appreciate you saying that but it
[1:35:15.280 --> 1:35:18.800]  doesn't have any power over me i don't care
[1:35:19.920 --> 1:35:23.520]  because it's a very fine line you've got to walk
[1:35:23.520 --> 1:35:26.720]  because when you get real racism thrown at you
[1:35:26.720 --> 1:35:33.200]  by hispanic groups by racist black groups
[1:35:33.200 --> 1:35:36.640]  you have to understand what they're doing
[1:35:36.640 --> 1:35:39.600]  and understand the perspective they're coming from
[1:35:39.600 --> 1:35:46.560]  and not hate them back and not get into the tribalism with them
[1:35:46.560 --> 1:35:50.480]  but at the same time you've got to also understand that that's being used as a
[1:35:50.480 --> 1:35:54.560]  tool of vulcanization and nevertheless
[1:35:54.560 --> 1:35:57.920]  that that is going on and that is happening same thing for black people
[1:35:57.920 --> 1:36:02.400]  in hispanics that have had white racism and discrimination
[1:36:02.400 --> 1:36:06.720]  which certainly goes on directed at them
[1:36:06.720 --> 1:36:13.360]  you have to be able to separate that out so how do i not play in to the
[1:36:13.360 --> 1:36:18.640]  paradigm of vulcanization and racial hatred and division
[1:36:18.640 --> 1:36:22.560]  when we try to point out that we can't have completely open borders
[1:36:22.560 --> 1:36:28.080]  we can't have 14 towns in south texas flying the mexican flag
[1:36:28.080 --> 1:36:31.680]  and speaking spanish in their courthouses in english isn't allowed
[1:36:31.680 --> 1:36:35.680]  but that's san antonio express news report
[1:36:38.160 --> 1:36:41.440]  i mean we can't have 30 million people here
[1:36:41.440 --> 1:36:45.200]  at least half of them believing this is mexico from texas
[1:36:45.200 --> 1:36:49.280]  to california and all the states in between
[1:36:49.280 --> 1:36:53.680]  aslan and we should put a map of aslan up
[1:36:53.680 --> 1:36:59.280]  ataslan aslan texas new mexico part of colorada
[1:36:59.280 --> 1:37:05.440]  arizona nevada california up into oregon
[1:37:09.120 --> 1:37:13.360]  and this is taught i mean when i was in high school here in austin
[1:37:13.360 --> 1:37:18.400]  i went to in dallas some and then last couple years here in austin i was in the
[1:37:18.400 --> 1:37:23.360]  art class and she took us on a field trip one day
[1:37:23.360 --> 1:37:30.320]  to see the ut art museum something along those lines it was a ut art display
[1:37:30.320 --> 1:37:35.040]  and there was a hispanic artist who gave us the tour of his art
[1:37:35.040 --> 1:37:38.560]  and it was all about how evil america is and how evil the gringo is a little
[1:37:38.560 --> 1:37:42.000]  reconquista and i just because i'd read a lot of history books
[1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:45.200]  wasn't even into that at that time didn't even really know
[1:37:45.200 --> 1:37:49.040]  and i was like yes but mexico also
[1:37:49.040 --> 1:37:53.840]  did control guatemala and got kicked out by the natives down there and mexico
[1:37:53.840 --> 1:37:56.240]  was corrupt and santa anna was a dictator and
[1:37:56.240 --> 1:37:59.920]  the people were enslaved and because he was given a speech demonizing texas
[1:37:59.920 --> 1:38:02.640]  and i said and i knew enough about texas history
[1:38:02.640 --> 1:38:05.920]  and they got very freaked out and he wouldn't have to talk with
[1:38:05.920 --> 1:38:10.480]  with the teacher and said who is this guy well they're like oh yes he's very
[1:38:10.480 --> 1:38:14.960]  and it was just because i know i saw an attack on my country
[1:38:14.960 --> 1:38:20.960]  and a distortion of my country and so the point is this is just everywhere
[1:38:20.960 --> 1:38:24.960]  so then i'm kind of this ron paul tight conservative libertarian
[1:38:24.960 --> 1:38:30.560]  first few years on radio as i'm really starting to go down the rabbit hole
[1:38:30.560 --> 1:38:35.760]  and i get invited to come give a speech at ut so i come down i don't even realize
[1:38:35.760 --> 1:38:40.880]  that the illegal aliens down there and others had pushed to have ut cancel
[1:38:40.880 --> 1:38:46.640]  texas independence day parade because it's now considered racism
[1:38:46.640 --> 1:38:49.600]  i mean texas independence day you're not not allowed to have it
[1:38:49.600 --> 1:38:52.560]  cities don't put it on counties don't put it on
[1:38:52.560 --> 1:38:56.080]  uh i guess a few towns like gonzalez do it's it's like it's dirty it's
[1:38:56.080 --> 1:39:00.480]  it's bad it's like you know it's like liquor you got to put in a brown bag or
[1:39:00.480 --> 1:39:03.840]  porno movies you got to put in a bag or whatever so nobody sees it
[1:39:03.840 --> 1:39:07.680]  you know when you're leaving the store uh it it's
[1:39:07.680 --> 1:39:11.280]  it's like bad it's it's like the second amendment where you got to sneak out to
[1:39:11.280 --> 1:39:14.720]  your car put the rifle in and go to the gun range and look around
[1:39:14.720 --> 1:39:17.680]  because you've already had neighbors call cops on you when they see you putting
[1:39:17.680 --> 1:39:22.000]  a gun in your car that's how screwed up our country is folks
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:25.760]  they take everything good and wholesome and they make it dirty so then i began
[1:39:25.760 --> 1:39:32.320]  to learn more and more and more and more and more and more
[1:39:32.320 --> 1:39:37.360]  about all of this and about the plan of san diego and how in the spanish
[1:39:37.360 --> 1:39:41.760]  bilingual schools in texas and california and other states they teach
[1:39:41.760 --> 1:39:45.040]  that they're going to overthrow and kill all whites
[1:39:45.040 --> 1:39:50.400]  16 years of age and older uh and that they actually launched the attack during
[1:39:50.400 --> 1:39:54.240]  world war one for the germans
[1:39:54.960 --> 1:39:58.720]  mainline history but nobody seems to know it and killed a bunch of people in
[1:39:58.720 --> 1:40:01.440]  south texas
[1:40:01.520 --> 1:40:05.200]  and i know this but then i'm not supposed to talk about it i'm supposed to
[1:40:05.200 --> 1:40:11.440]  just sit here and put up with it and then you go to the
[1:40:11.440 --> 1:40:15.360]  synco to maya parades and things and it is all osla on this
[1:40:15.360 --> 1:40:21.280]  down with america that uh right after 9 11 it was in the news that at the
[1:40:21.280 --> 1:40:25.280]  different rallies they were saying osama didn't do enough and of course that's
[1:40:25.280 --> 1:40:28.480]  all the false paradigm of some have been lodged in the ci front but the
[1:40:28.480 --> 1:40:32.000]  issue is it's soccer games when american team was there one week after the
[1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:36.320]  attacks they were chanting osama osama osama
[1:40:36.320 --> 1:40:40.080]  i mean the point is mexico on average really hates
[1:40:40.080 --> 1:40:45.360]  our guts my wife you know maybe every two years or so we go down
[1:40:45.360 --> 1:40:48.560]  to the mexican caribbean and she said last time she said i don't want to go
[1:40:48.560 --> 1:40:52.960]  down there anymore and i said why i go out it's cheap and i like it we can fly
[1:40:52.960 --> 1:40:56.800]  down there quick and go out and you know whatever she said
[1:40:56.800 --> 1:41:01.920]  you know i speak spanish and i just don't like what they're saying about us
[1:41:01.920 --> 1:41:05.280]  and it's just look at these gringo scum we're going to slit their throats we're
[1:41:05.280 --> 1:41:09.200]  going to take their country down and you're sitting there paying them
[1:41:09.200 --> 1:41:12.640]  and and and and they're living off of your business
[1:41:12.640 --> 1:41:17.040]  and and but it's just like you know look at this stupid gringos
[1:41:17.040 --> 1:41:21.280]  they ought to go back to europe stupid pilgrims and you know my wife's got to
[1:41:21.280 --> 1:41:25.680]  hear it in restaurants because she you know she's white she just lived in
[1:41:25.680 --> 1:41:29.760]  spain for four years and as a kid so she picked it up
[1:41:29.760 --> 1:41:33.600]  and it's just it's just constant it's constant
[1:41:33.600 --> 1:41:37.280]  i mean it's the equivalent of being like a black guy i guess in the 1940s in
[1:41:37.280 --> 1:41:41.200]  alabama if he was in a white restaurant it'd be look at that you know
[1:41:41.200 --> 1:41:45.040]  inward this that but but but the black guy couldn't understand the language
[1:41:45.040 --> 1:41:52.480]  he wouldn't even know what was going on so so so so it's this perfect
[1:41:52.480 --> 1:41:56.800]  it's this perfect way for this racism and vulcanization
[1:41:56.800 --> 1:42:02.160]  to grow because these stupid yuppies don't even know the three branches of
[1:42:02.160 --> 1:42:05.840]  government they don't even understand the basic
[1:42:05.840 --> 1:42:09.760]  way societies work and operate
[1:42:11.760 --> 1:42:14.560]  and so
[1:42:15.200 --> 1:42:18.880]  how are they going to know what people that have a totally different culture
[1:42:18.880 --> 1:42:26.080]  highly nationalistic racially based that lost two wars with us and hate our
[1:42:26.080 --> 1:42:32.960]  guts fundamentally i mean if it's a fact and you've got the government in the
[1:42:32.960 --> 1:42:36.080]  media teamed up because the government's globalist they want to break the country
[1:42:36.080 --> 1:42:39.200]  down they want to bankrupt the jobs they want to drive the wages down they want
[1:42:39.200 --> 1:42:42.480]  to use the u.s as a steam valve so there's not a real revolution in
[1:42:42.480 --> 1:42:45.360]  mexico so they can actually get some freedom
[1:42:45.360 --> 1:42:49.760]  mexico is the second most corrupt nation on earth after north korea
[1:42:49.760 --> 1:42:52.240]  in all the different international indexes
[1:42:52.240 --> 1:42:57.680]  united states is number six now so we're not too good either
[1:42:57.680 --> 1:43:02.640]  and america is falling we are losing our engine of a free market it's probably
[1:43:02.640 --> 1:43:07.840]  over for us you know the question now is what can we salvage and
[1:43:07.840 --> 1:43:12.320]  again the saddest part about this is hispanic americans are wonderful salt of
[1:43:12.320 --> 1:43:17.840]  the earth good people and that's one hard working smart intelligent
[1:43:17.840 --> 1:43:25.520]  inventive group who just really don't really talk about the kind of
[1:43:25.520 --> 1:43:34.720]  racist uh people that have picked up this liberation theology
[1:43:34.720 --> 1:43:39.040]  taught by the u.s government in mexico the u.s government's come out in the news
[1:43:39.040 --> 1:43:44.000]  in the 50 started paying for millions a year of little comic books in spanish
[1:43:44.000 --> 1:43:48.320]  about la rica and quista and aslan and and and the southwest
[1:43:48.320 --> 1:43:53.280]  because they planned this all along and so i'm going to play a clip of this
[1:43:53.280 --> 1:43:56.640]  uh we tried to find a spot where there's no cussing
[1:43:56.640 --> 1:44:00.640]  the really bad stuff's up on info wars and prison planet and we'll play some
[1:44:00.640 --> 1:44:04.000]  of that without audio for prison planet dot tv
[1:44:04.000 --> 1:44:09.280]  viewers and radio listeners but it's up on the alex jones channel at youtube as
[1:44:09.280 --> 1:44:14.480]  well uh this clip is a bunch of illegal aliens and i
[1:44:14.480 --> 1:44:22.160]  guess citizens in the texas town of trinity texas
[1:44:22.160 --> 1:44:25.920]  at a town hall meeting and in the town hall
[1:44:25.920 --> 1:44:29.280]  one of the issues brought up in one of the sections is the illegal aliens get
[1:44:29.280 --> 1:44:33.200]  unlimited free health care which is bankrupting the country i mean
[1:44:33.200 --> 1:44:36.480]  there's billions of people want to come here hundreds and hundreds of millions
[1:44:36.480 --> 1:44:39.920]  of latin americans we can't have you been to mexico city
[1:44:39.920 --> 1:44:43.760]  we just we can't do it california is now bankrupt and falling
[1:44:43.760 --> 1:44:48.400]  texas is on the verge of going bankrupt just paying for the prisoners alone in
[1:44:48.400 --> 1:44:52.480]  california is over 10 million dollars a year because it's not that the mexicans
[1:44:52.480 --> 1:44:55.760]  are all criminals it's that their criminals come up here
[1:44:55.760 --> 1:44:59.920]  they can come up here with fake names fake ids run from the law
[1:44:59.920 --> 1:45:05.440]  jump back and forth commit crimes i mean it's just an unlimited undocumented
[1:45:05.440 --> 1:45:08.640]  can do whatever they want
[1:45:10.880 --> 1:45:16.720]  and i remember when my cousin was in high school in san antonio and i go down
[1:45:16.720 --> 1:45:20.480]  there every summer spend a few weeks where i go down there christmas
[1:45:20.480 --> 1:45:23.440]  spend a week and i remember most his friends were hispanic and they were all
[1:45:23.440 --> 1:45:27.840]  their dads were all veterans the military you know you know pro usa 100
[1:45:27.840 --> 1:45:30.720]  percent and they would say hey man what do you
[1:45:30.720 --> 1:45:33.600]  think of the the uh and they would use a derogatory term
[1:45:33.600 --> 1:45:36.800]  for the illegal aliens and i thought it was some test or something if i was a
[1:45:36.800 --> 1:45:40.080]  racist you know white guilt little chicken neck yuppie
[1:45:40.080 --> 1:45:43.120]  and i would like no i i don't know anyone well they want to bring america
[1:45:43.120 --> 1:45:46.400]  down and they're bad news and blah blah blah and you
[1:45:46.400 --> 1:45:49.600]  so i mean the people that really know about this are mexican americans who
[1:45:49.600 --> 1:45:52.960]  just want to be called americans i mean you know i'm english and german and
[1:45:52.960 --> 1:45:56.880]  native american and a bunch of other irish scottish i don't run around calling
[1:45:56.880 --> 1:45:58.640]  myself all these other i'm just an american
[1:45:58.640 --> 1:46:02.000]  because i see they don't want us living in peace they want us all fighting with
[1:46:02.000 --> 1:46:04.720]  each other but if it's a global plan to use
[1:46:04.720 --> 1:46:09.040]  these people to bring the us down we have to address it so it's a catch 22
[1:46:09.040 --> 1:46:12.240]  how do you not address it
[1:46:12.880 --> 1:46:17.040]  when you have to address it so go ahead and blow it up full screen for folks
[1:46:17.040 --> 1:46:20.000]  well i guess we go ahead and just play the clip here it is
[1:46:20.000 --> 1:46:24.000]  that's what it is we're the majority now not the minority
[1:46:24.000 --> 1:46:27.440]  y'all are the minority now
[1:46:27.440 --> 1:46:31.760]  out here in a second take it over what um taking over what
[1:46:31.760 --> 1:46:36.400]  taking over what taking over america right
[1:46:38.000 --> 1:46:41.680]  you hear that america that's it over america too we've been
[1:46:41.680 --> 1:46:47.040]  kicked out getting you the boot who's y'all sir who's y'all
[1:46:47.040 --> 1:46:57.040]  one or more white people white people you're gonna kick us all out
[1:47:00.000 --> 1:47:11.040]  rallying in the mariachi music and mexican flags
[1:47:11.440 --> 1:47:16.160]  and there's video of them coming over and starting fights with everybody
[1:47:16.160 --> 1:47:21.440]  And, you know, there's just old men going, I don't want the healthcare bill. And they're like,
[1:47:21.440 --> 1:47:31.840]  racist, puto, I mean, on and on and on and on. It's just so sick.
[1:47:33.600 --> 1:47:39.600]  Meanwhile, the vaccines and soft kill weapons are designed to attack the brain and pancreas.
[1:47:39.600 --> 1:47:47.280]  And it's designed especially for people of Mesoamerican bloodlines. Let's put the
[1:47:47.280 --> 1:47:53.040]  portly fellow back up on screen. They've done studies that Americans were eating a similar
[1:47:53.040 --> 1:48:01.760]  diet even 40, 45, 50 years ago and weren't this fat. Why especially do you see Hispanics?
[1:48:03.680 --> 1:48:08.560]  What is it in some areas? Half the Hispanics have diabetes. Why is this guy going to probably
[1:48:08.560 --> 1:48:14.000]  end up having his legs amputated? Why is this guy going to end up probably when he's 40 dead?
[1:48:14.640 --> 1:48:19.600]  See, I actually love this guy. He's probably a sweet person. If you were out fishing with him
[1:48:19.600 --> 1:48:24.160]  or working with him or doing something, he feels threatened by these white guys that got American
[1:48:24.160 --> 1:48:29.680]  flags and some black guys with them that they call the N word. He feel like they just yell it over
[1:48:29.680 --> 1:48:34.480]  and over again. We're not going to play too many cuss words mixed in. And they start calling one of
[1:48:34.480 --> 1:48:40.560]  the big black cops in word. It doesn't go too well for him after that. They slam this guy out on the
[1:48:40.560 --> 1:48:46.160]  ground, but only after he was pushing people. But this guy is probably a sweet human being.
[1:48:46.160 --> 1:48:53.200]  He's just all jacked up tribally and he feels rejected by America and at a subconscious level
[1:48:53.200 --> 1:48:58.880]  he knows that America doesn't really like him. And so he's going to embrace that and he's got
[1:48:58.880 --> 1:49:06.080]  big lary conquista tattoos. Now this guy probably doesn't even eat that much. He's probably got
[1:49:06.080 --> 1:49:11.280]  diabetes because the vaccine, we've had top surgeons and brain surgeons and
[1:49:12.000 --> 1:49:17.600]  endocrinologists on this show. It is a fact that they cause an autoimmune response in the
[1:49:17.600 --> 1:49:21.840]  pancreas. And that's why you lose your pancreas. Mommy thought she was helping you when you're
[1:49:21.840 --> 1:49:26.400]  in school and gave you all those shots. It's race specific. The study show, it hurts whites,
[1:49:26.400 --> 1:49:31.920]  but not as bad as it hurts you. So see, you think some good old boys out there that don't want to
[1:49:31.920 --> 1:49:36.880]  live in communist country are bad because they're white. You don't know the real eugenicist.
[1:49:37.520 --> 1:49:42.960]  Put him back, see him as subhuman and have already injected him with something that knocked his
[1:49:42.960 --> 1:49:48.000]  pancreas out. I want to say this right now. I want to pray for this guy. I'm serious.
[1:49:48.800 --> 1:49:54.080]  God, please help this guy understand what's happened to him and to fight the new world order.
[1:49:54.080 --> 1:50:00.560]  And please help the guys in the mariachi band to wake up against the new world order. We can
[1:50:00.560 --> 1:50:05.600]  all just work together instead of doing this, please. Cause I, I feel for these little Hispanic
[1:50:05.600 --> 1:50:09.440]  children being given the vaccine shots that are going to die from them down the road.
[1:50:09.440 --> 1:50:14.640]  Many people dying immediately. Please help us all just come together. Cause this guy is
[1:50:14.640 --> 1:50:19.280]  gregarious and smiley and happy. And I don't think he's inherently evil. I just think he's
[1:50:19.280 --> 1:50:24.800]  like raw rowing for his football team and just just help us all come out of this. Oh man.
[1:50:26.880 --> 1:50:31.360]  So there I've said my prayer for this guy. Cause I mean, look, it's, it's sad.
[1:50:34.080 --> 1:50:41.520]  Who he needs to be against is John P. Holdren author of eco science population resources
[1:50:41.520 --> 1:50:57.120]  and environment. He's the guy that did it to you fell. Do you have trouble getting through the day?

[1:51:57.360 --> 1:52:03.360]  against humanity. Barack Obama is the tip of the spear. We've got to have a civilian national
[1:52:03.360 --> 1:52:10.640]  security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded. The Obama deception
[1:52:10.640 --> 1:52:15.600]  completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interests of the American people.
[1:52:15.600 --> 1:52:21.280]  While Obama's already fudging, fudged since day one in this election. If you have a demagogue
[1:52:21.280 --> 1:52:26.880]  with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group
[1:52:26.880 --> 1:52:33.760]  of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism. It's not about left or right. It's about
[1:52:33.760 --> 1:52:40.960]  a one world government. This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told and his real

[1:54:13.760 --> 1:54:20.080]  people on TV the video without the audio and all the cuss words. Again, you can watch it up at
[1:54:20.080 --> 1:54:29.120]  infowars.com and prismplanet.com. With these illegal aliens and I guess US citizens or whatever
[1:54:29.120 --> 1:54:36.720]  they are just screaming, calling the white people and the black people inwards in their face saying,
[1:54:36.720 --> 1:54:44.640]  come on, I want to physically attack you. And I'm not being macho here. People seen me at these
[1:54:44.640 --> 1:54:52.720]  rallies. I go ahead and say come on and kind of go wild. So there's something about a whole
[1:54:52.720 --> 1:54:58.480]  group of people tribally wanting to attack you that gets you going. And I understand the power
[1:54:58.480 --> 1:55:06.720]  of this. In fact, did you guys queue up Battle for the Republic? Maybe later I'll play a clip of
[1:55:06.720 --> 1:55:15.120]  Battle for the Republic where they, it's the extras from in game. But it's all over YouTube and
[1:55:15.120 --> 1:55:24.640]  Google where the American citizen protest peacefully 50 yards away from illegal aliens with an
[1:55:24.640 --> 1:55:29.040]  unpermitted protest, which is fine. But you know, the citizens do that. We get SWAT team. The
[1:55:29.040 --> 1:55:34.400]  illegals were left alone and the illegals don't like him protesting. So the police come over
[1:55:34.400 --> 1:55:40.320]  telling you can't protest. They take him. They slam his head in the ground, splits his head open.
[1:55:40.320 --> 1:55:46.800]  The cops get up high five. The illegal aliens and then the illegal aliens celebrate as he's
[1:55:46.800 --> 1:55:50.640]  putting handcuffs with blood pouring. And it's just the celebration of pure evil.
[1:55:50.640 --> 1:55:59.600]  It's injustice. See, it's just like you can put up Obama posters on power polls that are
[1:55:59.600 --> 1:56:04.000]  worshiping him. It's fine. You put them up against him felony charges. They're talking about
[1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:07.360]  with the state attorney general in Florida against a teenager.
[1:56:10.560 --> 1:56:14.720]  We got a guest coming up for about 20, 30 minutes. And I'm told he's going to be with us via
[1:56:14.720 --> 1:56:19.440]  video feeds. That'll be good too for present planet dot TV viewers. I do want to encourage
[1:56:19.440 --> 1:56:24.720]  people out there to financially support this radio show by supporting our sponsors,

[1:58:45.120 --> 1:59:01.360]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true.
[1:59:01.360 --> 1:59:19.200]  The government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead. Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages.
[1:59:19.200 --> 1:59:47.680]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution from science, a long time sponsor of ours. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's my solar backup.com. Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet. So go to my solar backup.com or call toll free 877-327-0365.

[2:00:23.680 --> 2:00:51.680]  Well, the next 30 minutes or so were joined by Frederick Gertin. Then I'm going to go back to your phone calls and a ton of news like the founder of the head of Greenpeace coming out and saying that they lie about the ice sheets melting.
[2:00:51.680 --> 2:01:11.680]  See, folks, the ice sheets on the northern South Pole get smaller in the summer and then get bigger in the winter. They do like this every year. We've put up the video, the satellite composites from NASA of the last one from 76 until now, over 30 years of it.
[2:01:11.680 --> 2:01:23.680]  And you can see it every year doing this. Ice cap gets bigger in the winter, smaller in the summer, bigger in the winter, smaller in the summer, bigger in the winter. And the ice sheets are actually getting bigger than they were 30 years ago.
[2:01:23.680 --> 2:01:37.680]  Total, they're melting less. They say polar bears can't swim, folks. They tell the kids that. I mean, it's incredible. We've just got to get people to focus in on real issues.
[2:01:37.680 --> 2:01:58.680]  Now, I wanted to get Frederick Gertin on the show with WG film and he made the film called Bananas. BananasTheMovie.com is the website and he's a filmmaker based in Sweden.
[2:01:58.680 --> 2:02:10.680]  And so why not just go right to him and have him basically sum up what the film covers. I've seen it. I think it really covers some important issues. Another snapshot of what's going on.
[2:02:10.680 --> 2:02:12.680]  Welcome to the airwaves with us.
[2:02:12.680 --> 2:02:15.680]  Thank you very much, Alex. Nice to be with you.
[2:02:15.680 --> 2:02:23.680]  Good to have you here with us. So tell us in a nutshell as we're about to go to break and we'll come back in more detail.
[2:02:23.680 --> 2:02:38.680]  I've done a film that mainly follows a court case in Los Angeles where an LA attorney represents a big group of banana workers from Nicaragua.
[2:02:38.680 --> 2:02:54.680]  And I follow this court case and they accuse the big banana company Dole for using banned pesticides and that their plaintiffs then get hurt by this, but they get sterile.
[2:02:54.680 --> 2:03:03.680]  So I follow that case. And it's a very interesting, I mean, this is a legal battle that's been ongoing for many years.
[2:03:03.680 --> 2:03:13.680]  I just cover a little bit of this, but I think at the same time, when you see a court case like that, you can also see how these powers, how they work and how they look like.
[2:03:13.680 --> 2:03:31.680]  Even if this story is about something that happened 30 years ago, where when the big producer, Dow Chemicals told their clients, please stop using this pesticide because our workers in our plant has got sterile.
[2:03:31.680 --> 2:03:41.680]  And all the other banana producing companies stopped, but Dole at that time, Standard Food Company said, no, no, we want to continue use to use this pesticide.
[2:03:41.680 --> 2:03:56.680]  And then they managed to get some kind of indemnity contract without chemicals and they imported 500,000 barrels more of pesticide to Nicaragua at that time.
[2:03:56.680 --> 2:04:03.680]  A pesticide that was by the EPA in the US said, don't use it. And it was later also banned.
[2:04:03.680 --> 2:04:05.680]  What is the name of the pesticide?
[2:04:05.680 --> 2:04:15.680]  It's the chemicals called DBCP. It had some different product names called Nemagon or Fumason.
[2:04:15.680 --> 2:04:33.680]  So it was a huge story at the time when the US plant workers got sterile by this. But of course, in every banana producing country, they have problems with sterile workers.
[2:04:33.680 --> 2:04:44.680]  All right, stay there, Mr. Gretin. We're going to come right back to you from Sweden, simulcasting, not just on the radio, but at prismplanet.tv and living color.
[2:04:44.680 --> 2:04:54.680]  The issue too is the residue of this is in the bananas and American citizens ate it as well. And just so happens to sterilize you.
[2:04:54.680 --> 2:05:03.680]  This is Alex Jones. Have you heard of the millionaire patriot? Well, you should. He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.

[2:05:21.680 --> 2:05:28.680]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.

[2:05:54.680 --> 2:06:03.680]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[2:06:03.680 --> 2:06:12.680]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones. Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it?
[2:06:12.680 --> 2:06:20.680]  Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick?
[2:06:20.680 --> 2:06:29.680]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[2:06:29.680 --> 2:06:38.680]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones.

[2:08:17.680 --> 2:08:33.680]  All right, my friends, we are back live, 8 minutes, 30 seconds into this third hour.
[2:08:33.680 --> 2:08:39.680]  Going back to Frederick Gretton, who made the film Bananas, the movie.
[2:08:39.680 --> 2:08:51.680]  And this is just another example of where they know a pesticide is sterilizing the people. Just like they knew Agent Orange was sterilizing people, causing birth defects, causing all these cancers.
[2:08:51.680 --> 2:09:09.680]  Bayer Pharmaceutical, knowingly, for a decade plus, knew that all their factor A had HIV and hepatitis in it, and that it was a death sentence for those that got the shot. And their own documents in court just admitted it, don't care.
[2:09:09.680 --> 2:09:19.680]  And they can even put this on national news and nobody gets in trouble. So that's why we're taking another snapshot to look at this and talk about issues that people in Latin America should really be concerned about.
[2:09:19.680 --> 2:09:26.680]  By the way, it just came out that that coup in Nicaragua turned out again. It was the CIA. It's now admitted.
[2:09:26.680 --> 2:09:30.680]  Meanwhile, you always have Obama saying, we're against this coup. We're not involved.
[2:09:30.680 --> 2:09:36.680]  Turns out the CIA ran the whole thing. It just never ends with these people. I mean, they just lie.
[2:09:36.680 --> 2:09:44.680]  But even I, unless we know their liars, still have trouble dealing with their level of duplicity and the things they do.
[2:09:44.680 --> 2:10:00.680]  And they do it in our name, folks, going back to the director of this film, Frederick Gretton. Frederick, continue with, give us a snapshot of the story of what happened in the court case and the film and where this is today.
[2:10:00.680 --> 2:10:22.680]  Well, it is, of course, a very complex story. I mean, I followed the very first court case in the U.S. court. Earlier on, these big companies, Dole and Dow Chemicals, had lost in the Nicaraguan court and they were ordered to pay a lot of, like, $500 million.
[2:10:22.680 --> 2:10:41.680]  Of course, they never did it. But this was the first case in the U.S. court. And this very first one that I cover, Dole is fined guilty on malice in five cases of knowingly sterilizing people with this pesticide.
[2:10:41.680 --> 2:11:00.680]  So they actually lose. Even if they win in some cases, because you really have to prove that every plaintiff got hurt and they were not successful at all, but with five of these plaintiffs, the jury found Dole guilty with malice.
[2:11:00.680 --> 2:11:13.680]  But then in the same court, there were also new group of workers coming up. And Dole then kicked out their attorneys and brought in a new and bigger, more aggressive firm.
[2:11:13.680 --> 2:11:32.680]  And they have been very successful by producing evidence in Nicaragua that says that the American plaintiff lawyers and the Nicaraguan judicial system is corrupt and that they did a lot of fraud things.
[2:11:32.680 --> 2:11:51.680]  But the problem is proving the witnesses who says this was a fraud in court are all so-called John Dole witnesses. So it's very hard for us as citizens or journalists or filmmakers to really know what is what, because if it's John Dole witness, how can I check the sources?
[2:11:51.680 --> 2:12:02.680]  It's very hard. And all this accusation against the plaintiff lawyers is done in the forum where they didn't have any voice. They couldn't do any cross-exam.
[2:12:02.680 --> 2:12:21.680]  So right now, this judge who was presiding the first case has counseled all the other Nicaraguan cases and accused the attorney in this case for fraud.
[2:12:21.680 --> 2:12:35.680]  So at the same time, our film is finished. We were about to premiere at the Los Angeles Film Festival. Dole brings our film trailer, the trailer you can find on our website, but ask them at movie.com.
[2:12:35.680 --> 2:12:53.680]  This very trailer they take to the judge and they ask her to stop the film. And when she refuses to do that, they send a so-called cease and desist letter to us, but not only to us, also to every single sponsor of the LA Film Festival.
[2:12:53.680 --> 2:13:01.680]  They didn't actually write to the Film Festival. They wrote to the sponsors of the Film Festival, which is not really a fair thing to do.
[2:13:01.680 --> 2:13:15.680]  Are you kidding? I have people attacking my family, lying about my family, calling sponsors, doing stuff at my house. This is how these people, the same corporate system, this is how they operate.
[2:13:15.680 --> 2:13:26.680]  Terrorism is what these people do. Anybody who doubts this global corporate state just has to start fighting it to experience just how real it is.
[2:13:26.680 --> 2:13:39.680]  Yeah, I actually got it into my family now, that's for sure, because after we screened the film in LA, they threatened to sue us all the way.
[2:13:39.680 --> 2:13:48.680]  But we all the time knew they hadn't seen the film. So we thought, all our lawyers said, come on, this film is balanced. They had nothing to sue us for.
[2:13:48.680 --> 2:13:57.680]  And we showed the film, there were like 10 lawyers on Dole in the theater, including the vice president of Dole, who was in the theater.
[2:13:57.680 --> 2:14:07.680]  And I gave them a speech of an open America that where you, I mean, I think that all kind of voices are important in society.
[2:14:07.680 --> 2:14:22.680]  Also the voice of the documentary filmmaker, because even in our trailer, on our web page, it's a place called Vimeo, and there's a sponsor link close to our trailer.
[2:14:22.680 --> 2:14:32.680]  Get to sponsor the link, Dole, of course. So wherever people can write, if people Google our film, they will find a sponsor link from Dole,
[2:14:32.680 --> 2:14:38.680]  which means that their voice is always out there. So why shouldn't ours be out there?
[2:14:38.680 --> 2:14:48.680]  But so I thought, well, now they won't sue us. But of course they did, because somebody told me that if a big cooperation like that threatened to sue, they have to do it,
[2:14:48.680 --> 2:14:59.680]  because otherwise they are not big boys. I don't know. I don't understand that mentality, but it's obviously how they think.
[2:14:59.680 --> 2:15:02.680]  So where is the suit going now?
[2:15:02.680 --> 2:15:15.680]  Oh, you know, before I had, I never had a personal lawyer before. I didn't even know so much about lawyers, but now I'm learning a lot about American lawyers.
[2:15:15.680 --> 2:15:30.680]  And so right now we have an American lawyer representing us and preparing our defense. So I guess it will be filed quite soon to the court in Los Angeles.
[2:15:30.680 --> 2:15:36.680]  But I mean, you should ask me too much about it, because I'm a filmmaker. I'm not a lawyer, you know.
[2:15:36.680 --> 2:15:42.680]  No, I understand. But I mean, that's the classic intimidation, just trying to keep you from distributing the film.
[2:15:42.680 --> 2:15:50.680]  I would tell your lawyers, you might want to look into countersuing them for torturous interference, for trying to violate your civil rights, your First Amendment,
[2:15:50.680 --> 2:16:00.680]  because clearly going over the film, it is balanced. These things did happen and did transpire. You're just covering a court case.
[2:16:00.680 --> 2:16:05.680]  So they're really trying to frustrate free speech.
[2:16:05.680 --> 2:16:15.680]  And so I think the best defense is a good offense. I mean, what are they claiming, defamation in their suit, or are they just trying to injunction?
[2:16:15.680 --> 2:16:18.680]  Defamation, defamation is lander, yeah.
[2:16:18.680 --> 2:16:21.680]  But they were found, as you said, guilty in court, right?
[2:16:21.680 --> 2:16:29.680]  Yes, and then that's the court case we follow. And that's, it's of course still valid, that sentence.
[2:16:29.680 --> 2:16:37.680]  That verdict, even if they are appealing it, and we tell the audience that it's under appeal, of course, why shouldn't we?
[2:16:37.680 --> 2:16:48.680]  But I think the painful thing for Dole here is that their own CEO is in court, sitting and admitting that they actually did these bad things,
[2:16:48.680 --> 2:16:53.680]  that they used the pesticide and everybody else stopped using.
[2:16:53.680 --> 2:17:07.680]  And of course, if you have a company selling goods that are supposed to be healthy and then your workers claim that they got harmed,
[2:17:07.680 --> 2:17:12.680]  it's of course complicates the image of the company. But that's not really my fault.
[2:17:12.680 --> 2:17:19.680]  I mean, also CNN did stories on this and LA Times did stories on this. Why didn't they sue them?
[2:17:19.680 --> 2:17:24.680]  So is your film now out and available?
[2:17:24.680 --> 2:17:32.680]  Not yet. I mean, it will for sure be available in the US and in many other countries.
[2:17:32.680 --> 2:17:40.680]  We opened theatrical in Sweden quite soon and we will certainly also go theatrical in the US and Canada and the UK and many other countries.
[2:17:40.680 --> 2:17:45.680]  There is a strong interest for this film, from festivals and so on.
[2:17:45.680 --> 2:17:52.680]  Yeah, I would think in the end their attempted bullying and violating your First Amendment will only backfire on them.
[2:17:52.680 --> 2:17:58.680]  But Dole and before that United Fruit is an admitted basically a CIA company.
[2:17:58.680 --> 2:18:06.680]  It's not even really a real company from my research. I mean, it's really just a covert arm into Latin America and all of their sordid past.
[2:18:06.680 --> 2:18:18.680]  So, you know, you got a bunch of spooks over there that think they own all the rest of us and now you talk about the film, how they knew it was sterilizing people.
[2:18:18.680 --> 2:18:25.680]  I mean, was that like a little added goodie for them or what was it? Or did they just not care?
[2:18:25.680 --> 2:18:36.680]  I mean, you know, they have a great pesticide that is good for production and somebody tells them, come on, we have a problem here.
[2:18:36.680 --> 2:18:51.680]  And of course, maybe they think, oh, well, we don't have that problem really here because that's part of their defense is saying that the level of pesticide sprayed on a plantation wasn't enough to make people sterile.
[2:18:51.680 --> 2:19:03.680]  But the problem is, of course, in a plantation is that people handle, you know, the used barrel, people bring them to make a stove at home and, you know, people do a lot of things with it barrels.
[2:19:03.680 --> 2:19:11.680]  Of course, people get a lot. I mean, not only the workers get close to this pest that everybody had.
[2:19:11.680 --> 2:19:19.680]  It also gets in the water supply. But, you know, a big company's tried to sue people and say Agent Orange was not bad for you.
[2:19:19.680 --> 2:19:23.680]  And of course, it came out. It was. And there have been a lot of other poisons.
[2:19:23.680 --> 2:19:34.680]  And, you know, the issue here, I think, is this attack on your free speech. For me, we've got Mr. Gretin.
[2:19:34.680 --> 2:19:42.680]  Mr. Gretin, stay right there. We're going to come right back to you after this quick break and continue discussing the film Bananas.
[2:19:42.680 --> 2:19:49.680]  But it's like A.K.A. Tommy Chung after the Feds raided and stole all the DVDs. It just made the film 100 times bigger.
[2:19:49.680 --> 2:20:13.680]  The boys at the CIA are probably just doing you a favor.
[2:20:13.680 --> 2:20:24.680]  The heirloom garden seed time capsule can withstand three tons of weight. It's 100% rhodo-proof, waterproof, and comes with a whopping 6,000 healthy vegetable seeds from 20 varieties that will grow anywhere in the USA.

[2:20:55.680 --> 2:21:02.680]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. It's Ron Paul's birthday and also money mom day for Ron Paul's 2010 bid for US Senate.
[2:21:02.680 --> 2:21:11.680]  I'm happy to report a very successful fundraiser at 12.30 p.m. central time and has already raised $471,667.
[2:21:11.680 --> 2:21:15.680]  For more information regarding this, come to GCNLive.com.
[2:21:15.680 --> 2:21:20.680]  Again, that's GCNLive.com. Once more, it's www.gcnlive.com.
[2:21:20.680 --> 2:21:42.680]  And happy birthday to the Ron Paul family.
[2:21:50.680 --> 2:21:55.680]  686-2237
[2:21:55.680 --> 2:22:01.680]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[2:22:01.680 --> 2:22:09.680]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[2:22:09.680 --> 2:22:15.680]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[2:22:15.680 --> 2:22:20.680]  While Obama's already fudging, fudged since day one in this election.
[2:22:20.680 --> 2:22:31.680]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[2:22:31.680 --> 2:22:35.680]  It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government.
[2:22:35.680 --> 2:22:42.680]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[2:22:42.680 --> 2:22:50.680]  This is your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com, or download it in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:22:50.680 --> 2:23:16.680]  The Obama deception. The people strike back.
[2:23:16.680 --> 2:23:44.680]  The Obama deception.

[2:23:47.680 --> 2:23:51.680]  Call Alcazone today at 1-800-810-1888.
[2:23:51.680 --> 2:23:55.680]  That's 1-800-810-1888.
[2:23:55.680 --> 2:24:18.680]  Look, all I know about is the history of fruit companies in Guatemala, Nicaragua, and all those countries.
[2:24:18.680 --> 2:24:27.680]  I know about other companies and Agent Orange and the rest of it. I remember reading about Dole losing this suit.
[2:24:27.680 --> 2:24:37.680]  So, I mean, getting off that subject, I just can't imagine how they can sue you then when your film is about the trial, unless this is only about pure intimidation.
[2:24:37.680 --> 2:24:44.680]  Have you talked to lawyers about countersuing Dole fruit?
[2:24:44.680 --> 2:24:51.680]  I mean, I have talked to loads of lawyers, and of course, many people recommend us to do that.
[2:24:51.680 --> 2:25:00.680]  And of course, we also think that they have been successful in making our lives a bit...
[2:25:00.680 --> 2:25:12.680]  And also destroying partly the plans we had for the US, because they will also be successful, because I think they use this suing us as some kind of smoke screen.
[2:25:12.680 --> 2:25:19.680]  They transform themselves from the guys who did bad things to suddenly to be the victims.
[2:25:19.680 --> 2:25:32.680]  So, it's kind of a smart thing they do in that sense, because I mean, I didn't spray this pesticide, but suddenly I'm kind of a crook, you know?
[2:25:32.680 --> 2:25:34.680]  And it's a very strange feeling.
[2:25:34.680 --> 2:25:36.680]  Well, that's just how it works.
[2:25:36.680 --> 2:25:43.680]  The old World War II saying a fighter bomber's cruise was when you're over the target, you're getting the flak.
[2:25:43.680 --> 2:25:46.680]  So, when you're over the target, you're going to be attacked.
[2:25:46.680 --> 2:25:55.680]  I mean, I don't know... I mean, have you had women calling your wife up if you're married saying that you've gotten them pregnant and stuff?
[2:25:55.680 --> 2:25:58.680]  Or have you had people hang dead animals on your door yet?
[2:25:58.680 --> 2:26:02.680]  No, no, no, no. It's still very decent.
[2:26:02.680 --> 2:26:07.680]  I mean, we... I would say the nice folks at Dole would do something like that.
[2:26:07.680 --> 2:26:10.680]  I'm just saying that's the kind of stuff that we've had over the years.
[2:26:10.680 --> 2:26:16.680]  And, you know, if you just let folks know you enjoy it, please give you more, then it loses the fun.
[2:26:16.680 --> 2:26:20.680]  It's almost like at a psychic level, these people do this.
[2:26:20.680 --> 2:26:30.680]  But specifically, though, in the court case, specifically, they found that this did knowingly sterilize them?
[2:26:30.680 --> 2:26:36.680]  That's the verdict from the jury in LA, yes, that they knowingly sterilized people.
[2:26:36.680 --> 2:26:41.680]  I mean, they were found guilty on malice by this jury.
[2:26:41.680 --> 2:26:45.680]  And malice means you did it meanly. I mean, you knew you were doing it.
[2:26:45.680 --> 2:26:46.680]  Exactly.
[2:26:46.680 --> 2:26:54.680]  You're not just liable for accidentally using something that you're cobalt to pay for now, but that they knowingly...
[2:26:54.680 --> 2:26:58.680]  So, this came out in court then that they knowingly did it?
[2:26:58.680 --> 2:27:00.680]  Yes, yes, it did.
[2:27:00.680 --> 2:27:05.680]  So, of course, that's something they want to create a big smoke screen around.
[2:27:05.680 --> 2:27:13.680]  And suddenly there is some kind of debate on the filmmaker who is doing a unfair film.
[2:27:13.680 --> 2:27:17.680]  So, that's kind of a way of, you know, putting spotlight somewhere else.
[2:27:17.680 --> 2:27:25.680]  You know, and what is... I mean, the spotlight should, of course, be on their deeds and how they don't fulfill.
[2:27:25.680 --> 2:27:29.680]  I mean, these are their former workers. They should take care of them.
[2:27:29.680 --> 2:27:33.680]  If they did a mistake, they should try to make good again.
[2:27:33.680 --> 2:27:37.680]  I think any good corporation should do that. And they haven't.
[2:27:37.680 --> 2:27:48.680]  Well, reading from the Los Angeles judge who found a pervasive conspiracy to defraud U.S. courts by plaintiffs, attorneys, and Nicaraguan judges,
[2:27:48.680 --> 2:27:56.680]  Dole said it repeatedly, implored director Frederick Gretton and producer Margaret...
[2:27:56.680 --> 2:27:58.680]  What is it, Jan Guard?
[2:27:58.680 --> 2:28:09.680]  To revise the film bananas to show that the lawsuit against Dole was thrown out in April by Los Angeles judge who found a pervasive conspiracy
[2:28:09.680 --> 2:28:13.680]  to defraud U.S. courts by plaintiffs, attorneys, and Nicaraguan judges.
[2:28:13.680 --> 2:28:16.680]  But you're saying the court case was won.
[2:28:16.680 --> 2:28:22.680]  That... The course case I followed was won and that is still under appeal.
[2:28:22.680 --> 2:28:31.680]  She talks about the second and third... I mean, her findings in court is about other cases.
[2:28:31.680 --> 2:28:39.680]  And then she made some... She talked a little bit in court about that maybe also this case I followed could also have been fraudulent.
[2:28:39.680 --> 2:28:50.680]  But this case on all these plaintiffs, Dole had more than two years of checking everything and testing them and finding out a lot of things.
[2:28:50.680 --> 2:28:54.680]  And they didn't find all these things.
[2:28:54.680 --> 2:28:58.680]  So, I mean, and I'm just telling that story.
[2:28:58.680 --> 2:29:03.680]  And of course, then I update my viewers about what happened afterwards. You've seen the film, so you know that.
[2:29:03.680 --> 2:29:04.680]  Yeah.
[2:29:04.680 --> 2:29:09.680]  Well, no, look, I'm no fan of Dole and I certainly think a lot of these pesticides need to be looked into.
[2:29:09.680 --> 2:29:14.680]  And I know that these fruit companies have a really sorted history down in Latin America.
[2:29:14.680 --> 2:29:20.680]  And we also know judges and a lot of times will engage in political activities.
[2:29:20.680 --> 2:29:23.680]  But I really do appreciate you coming on the show.
[2:29:23.680 --> 2:29:30.680]  And I hope to have you back up once the film is in stores on television so people can see it.
[2:29:30.680 --> 2:29:34.680]  Our guest, of course, is the maker of the film Bananas.
[2:29:34.680 --> 2:29:37.680]  We're going to come back on the other side to about five more minutes with our guest.
[2:29:37.680 --> 2:29:40.680]  Let him finish up any other comments he's got to make about the film.
[2:29:45.680 --> 2:29:49.680]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[2:29:49.680 --> 2:29:52.680]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:29:54.680 --> 2:29:58.680]  Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[2:29:58.680 --> 2:30:00.680]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[2:30:00.680 --> 2:30:04.680]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor,
[2:30:04.680 --> 2:30:09.680]  they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[2:30:09.680 --> 2:30:14.680]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[2:30:14.680 --> 2:30:16.680]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[2:30:16.680 --> 2:30:23.680]  The Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[2:30:23.680 --> 2:30:28.680]  The Acola Blue 28 produces up to seven gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere
[2:30:28.680 --> 2:30:34.680]  and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[2:30:34.680 --> 2:30:37.680]  That's right. Clean water right from the air you breathe.

[2:30:52.680 --> 2:30:55.680]  This is Alex Jones.
[2:30:55.680 --> 2:30:57.680]  Have you heard of the millionaire patriot?
[2:30:57.680 --> 2:30:58.680]  Well, you should.
[2:30:58.680 --> 2:31:02.680]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[2:31:02.680 --> 2:31:03.680]  That's right.
[2:31:03.680 --> 2:31:09.680]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute
[2:31:09.680 --> 2:31:13.680]  and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar.
[2:31:13.680 --> 2:31:20.680]  Plus, if you act fast, the millionaire patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[2:31:20.680 --> 2:31:27.680]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[2:31:27.680 --> 2:31:33.680]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[2:31:33.680 --> 2:31:34.680]  This is real.
[2:31:34.680 --> 2:31:35.680]  Don't miss out.
[2:31:35.680 --> 2:31:42.680]  Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course, plus a 30-state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar.

[2:31:54.680 --> 2:31:59.680]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[2:31:59.680 --> 2:32:03.680]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[2:32:03.680 --> 2:32:09.680]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[2:32:09.680 --> 2:32:14.680]  It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[2:32:14.680 --> 2:32:21.680]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[2:32:21.680 --> 2:32:24.680]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[2:32:24.680 --> 2:32:28.680]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[2:32:28.680 --> 2:32:33.680]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[2:32:33.680 --> 2:32:38.680]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[2:32:38.680 --> 2:32:43.680]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[2:32:43.680 --> 2:32:47.680]  That's mysolarbackup.com. Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.
[2:32:47.680 --> 2:32:53.680]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call toll-free 877-327-0365.
[2:32:53.680 --> 2:32:57.680]  It's Frederick Gerton.
[2:32:57.680 --> 2:32:59.680]  For some reason, I can't get names straight today.
[2:32:59.680 --> 2:33:02.680]  He probably was at three hours' sleep last night.
[2:33:02.680 --> 2:33:06.680]  Flying in from a very important interview I did with Governor Jesse Ventura.
[2:33:06.680 --> 2:33:09.680]  He interviewed me. I interviewed him.
[2:33:09.680 --> 2:33:10.680]  So that was exciting.
[2:33:10.680 --> 2:33:13.680]  Did some other stuff, other things we're working on?
[2:33:13.680 --> 2:33:23.680]  We'll announce the next few months.
[2:33:23.680 --> 2:33:29.680]  I will tell you, there's a good chance Ventura is going to be in studio with us coming up the next month with some big announcements.
[2:33:29.680 --> 2:33:32.680]  That's if he's getting ready to go down to Mexico.
[2:33:32.680 --> 2:33:34.680]  He may end up having to stay.
[2:33:34.680 --> 2:33:40.680]  But I got a bunch of news and your phone call is coming up at 1-800.
[2:33:40.680 --> 2:33:43.680]  2-5 at 9-92-31.
[2:33:43.680 --> 2:33:53.680]  Going back to the filmmaker, Frederick, specifically though, they're not using this pesticide anymore for a reason.
[2:33:53.680 --> 2:33:59.680]  And this reminds me of the Merck articles in ABC News.
[2:33:59.680 --> 2:34:00.680]  In fact, pull that up.
[2:34:00.680 --> 2:34:01.680]  I forget the exact headline.
[2:34:01.680 --> 2:34:07.680]  Something like Merck said they would liquidate foes or Merck said that they would terminate foes.
[2:34:07.680 --> 2:34:10.680]  And it said, we'll go to their homes where they live and get them.
[2:34:10.680 --> 2:34:25.680]  And when Merck was caught in federal court sending out, quote, seek and destroy teams, and by the way, microbiologists and scientists that have been exposing them and chemists were dying mysteriously,
[2:34:25.680 --> 2:34:28.680]  they said, oh, we meant figuratively to go to their homes and kill them.
[2:34:28.680 --> 2:34:32.680]  So, I mean, you have a lot of courage doing what you've done.
[2:34:32.680 --> 2:34:46.680]  I think that's the strongest issue here is that you didn't do this with malice, whether you're 100% right or 90% right, that the court had ruled this.
[2:34:46.680 --> 2:34:49.680]  They'd already said stop using it.
[2:34:49.680 --> 2:34:51.680]  Dole was the last to be using it.
[2:34:51.680 --> 2:34:54.680]  These people believe they become sterile.
[2:34:54.680 --> 2:34:57.680]  There's a lot of evidence that pesticides do do that.
[2:34:57.680 --> 2:34:58.680]  And there it is.
[2:34:58.680 --> 2:34:59.680]  That's how the Australian news.
[2:34:59.680 --> 2:35:00.680]  Just click on the link.
[2:35:00.680 --> 2:35:04.680]  Merck drew up a hit list of doctors to be neutralized.
[2:35:04.680 --> 2:35:09.680]  And we'll take you to the actual source article there by clicking on the entire article area.
[2:35:09.680 --> 2:35:13.680]  Because, I mean, this is the kind of stuff that goes on.
[2:35:13.680 --> 2:35:14.680]  Go ahead, sir.
[2:35:14.680 --> 2:35:25.680]  Now, I mean, can you can reach all your listeners because it is kind of scary to be sued by a very big corporation.
[2:35:25.680 --> 2:35:30.680]  And, you know, here back in my country, I've been interviewed a lot of times.
[2:35:30.680 --> 2:35:38.680]  Every single journalist who has been writing about me has been contacted by Goals PR firm in Washington.
[2:35:38.680 --> 2:35:41.680]  So, they are extremely active and they spend a lot of money.
[2:35:41.680 --> 2:35:45.680]  So, my only way is to get out is to get out like here.
[2:35:45.680 --> 2:35:47.680]  And also, we have a Facebook group called Bananas.
[2:35:47.680 --> 2:35:50.680]  People can find that and be a member.
[2:35:50.680 --> 2:35:54.680]  And of course, also find our web page, BananasTheMovie.com.
[2:35:54.680 --> 2:35:55.680]  It's very good.
[2:35:55.680 --> 2:36:01.680]  I mean, people who would like to support us to join us because then we, it's easier for us to reach out when we need to.
[2:36:01.680 --> 2:36:07.680]  Because we need friends because it is very, it is scary, to be honest.
[2:36:07.680 --> 2:36:14.680]  Well, you're going to be just fine as long as you don't let them intimidate you into coming out and saying that we should all bathe in the pesticide.
[2:36:14.680 --> 2:36:20.680]  And that, you know, it should be added to the air and the oxygen and, you know, carbon dioxide is bad.
[2:36:20.680 --> 2:36:24.680]  We must ban it because it's, but plants breathe, but we must all drink the poison.
[2:36:24.680 --> 2:36:31.680]  I mean, you know, hypothetically, you know, I guess, I mean, they tried to, other companies try to stop people exposing everything else.
[2:36:31.680 --> 2:36:35.680]  And so I think you're going to turn out just fine in the end of the day.
[2:36:35.680 --> 2:36:37.680]  I mean, they're not using the pesticide anymore.
[2:36:37.680 --> 2:36:43.680]  What is it they're saying about you that is supposedly, that's so defamatory of them?
[2:36:43.680 --> 2:36:46.680]  I mean, are they being specific about what they're saying?
[2:36:46.680 --> 2:36:48.680]  Is it true?
[2:36:48.680 --> 2:36:54.680]  I mean, they, I mean, they're the lawsuit is like 65 pages.
[2:36:54.680 --> 2:37:00.680]  And of course, it's, it's, it's many, many words from lawyers, you know.
[2:37:00.680 --> 2:37:04.680]  So it's, it's very hard to put it in short.
[2:37:04.680 --> 2:37:11.680]  So I mean, it's, it's full of, of details that are not all true.
[2:37:11.680 --> 2:37:13.680]  So it is, it is a bit tricky.
[2:37:13.680 --> 2:37:23.680]  I mean, the bottom line is that they don't like me to do the film because they think that the reality has changed since the film was finished.
[2:37:23.680 --> 2:37:26.680]  But they never contact me in a friendly way.
[2:37:26.680 --> 2:37:29.680]  They, they were writing bullying letters from the first day.
[2:37:29.680 --> 2:37:34.680]  There have never been any kind of attempt to, to have a dialogue or something like that.
[2:37:34.680 --> 2:37:36.680]  They have just been attacking.
[2:37:36.680 --> 2:37:39.680]  But we still think that this film is totally valid.
[2:37:39.680 --> 2:37:45.680]  And there is, I mean, it is, it is a film that works and it is valid.
[2:37:45.680 --> 2:37:48.680]  So they have nothing to come, come after, I think.
[2:37:48.680 --> 2:37:54.680]  Well, you know, they operate, but these big fruit companies operate like gods in Central and South America.
[2:37:54.680 --> 2:37:58.680]  And, you know, it's the only sorts of income down there.
[2:37:58.680 --> 2:38:00.680]  It's just a labyrinthine.
[2:38:00.680 --> 2:38:05.680]  And so that's how they try to operate here in the Western world as well.
[2:38:05.680 --> 2:38:11.680]  Okay, well, the website again for the bananas movie, give that out for folks.
[2:38:11.680 --> 2:38:16.680]  So it's bananas, the movie.com, bananas, the movie.com.
[2:38:16.680 --> 2:38:18.680]  And there's a Facebook group called bananas.
[2:38:18.680 --> 2:38:20.680]  It's very good to, to join.
[2:38:20.680 --> 2:38:21.680]  Please.
[2:38:21.680 --> 2:38:24.680]  Okay, well, we'll probably talk to you again as this develops and unfolds.
[2:38:24.680 --> 2:38:26.680]  Thank you so much for coming on the show with us.
[2:38:26.680 --> 2:38:27.680]  Thank you.
[2:38:27.680 --> 2:38:28.680]  Thanks.
[2:38:28.680 --> 2:38:29.680]  You bet.
[2:38:29.680 --> 2:38:30.680]  Take care.
[2:38:30.680 --> 2:38:31.680]  There he goes, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:38:31.680 --> 2:38:39.680]  Okay, um, I've got a bunch of calls here that I want to go to.
[2:38:39.680 --> 2:38:44.680]  Why don't you give me a fresh list or is, or is this a fresh list, John?
[2:38:44.680 --> 2:38:48.680]  It is a fresh list because I've been taking calls in about 30, 40 minutes.
[2:38:48.680 --> 2:38:51.680]  Let's go ahead and go to some of those phone calls.
[2:38:51.680 --> 2:39:00.680]  And then we've got the guests coming up who, uh, had the AR 15 strapped us back in Arizona that made international headlines.
[2:39:00.680 --> 2:39:07.680]  As the domesticated population of the planet shook in fear at someone other than the police or military with a gun.
[2:39:07.680 --> 2:39:11.680]  Uh, let's go ahead and talk to Tom and Georgia.
[2:39:11.680 --> 2:39:12.680]  Tom, you're on the air.
[2:39:12.680 --> 2:39:16.680]  Hey, Alex, God bless you in the excellent prayer earlier.
[2:39:16.680 --> 2:39:21.680]  Uh, one of our biggest weapons, and I think we've got a pretty sharp one is the sword.
[2:39:21.680 --> 2:39:27.680]  And remember what Jesus said, a house divided amongst itself cannot stand.
[2:39:27.680 --> 2:39:37.680]  Uh, while you were out yesterday, Kansas city, uh, Missouri, uh, are giving, uh, trial vaccines to six months to 17 year olds,
[2:39:37.680 --> 2:39:39.680]  not to make you blow up or anything on that.
[2:39:39.680 --> 2:39:40.680]  No, I did see that.
[2:39:40.680 --> 2:39:47.680]  No, no, they're giving trial vaccines in Texas, Missouri, all 50 states, the main state, Texas is where it started.
[2:39:47.680 --> 2:39:56.680]  And I read all the mainstream news articles where a large percentage are dying of brain degenerative disorder.
[2:39:56.680 --> 2:40:01.680]  I mean, I mean, they get paralyzed and die, quit breathing and they tell the doctors just be quiet.
[2:40:01.680 --> 2:40:05.680]  Don't, don't you just tell us quietly that they're dying, keep it quiet.
[2:40:05.680 --> 2:40:08.680]  And it's just incredible.
[2:40:08.680 --> 2:40:11.680]  Hey, I have one question for your next guest.
[2:40:11.680 --> 2:40:14.680]  If you could maybe ask him, what is that 4409?
[2:40:14.680 --> 2:40:22.680]  I heard you on, uh, you, you were mentioned on a talk show program last night and, uh, they weren't talking real highly of you,
[2:40:22.680 --> 2:40:25.680]  but it was publicity all the same and I'll listen for your.
[2:40:25.680 --> 2:40:26.680]  Come on.
[2:40:26.680 --> 2:40:28.680]  What is what?
[2:40:28.680 --> 2:40:32.680]  4409.
[2:40:32.680 --> 2:40:37.680]  They, they, they said something about 4409 program.
[2:40:37.680 --> 2:40:43.680]  Um, you know, maybe it doesn't really ring a bell and I was, what was it in context of?
[2:40:43.680 --> 2:40:45.680]  What were they saying it dealt with?
[2:40:45.680 --> 2:40:54.680]  Well, it was dealing with Chris about you and all your listeners or lunatics, you know, the same old rhetoric.
[2:40:54.680 --> 2:40:56.680]  Uh, what, what show was it?
[2:40:56.680 --> 2:40:58.680]  It was, it was out of Atlanta.
[2:40:58.680 --> 2:40:59.680]  I don't even know.
[2:40:59.680 --> 2:41:00.680]  It was just some clowns.
[2:41:00.680 --> 2:41:03.680]  They, they didn't have much respect for myself personally.
[2:41:03.680 --> 2:41:05.680]  So.
[2:41:05.680 --> 2:41:09.680]  And what they were, I mean, I mean 4409.
[2:41:09.680 --> 2:41:10.680]  I don't know.
[2:41:10.680 --> 2:41:11.680]  I don't know.
[2:41:11.680 --> 2:41:14.680]  There's a YouTube video on it, but I didn't really.
[2:41:14.680 --> 2:41:16.680]  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[2:41:16.680 --> 2:41:20.680]  A guy was wearing a t-shirt that said 4409.
[2:41:20.680 --> 2:41:29.680]  I guess I don't know. I just YouTube it and it was some different things that you have bits and pieces of a lot of your stuff from the past.
[2:41:29.680 --> 2:41:36.680]  And it didn't really, I don't know if they were just saying that to throw off their boss.
[2:41:36.680 --> 2:41:37.680]  No, no, no, no, no.
[2:41:37.680 --> 2:41:38.680]  You know what?
[2:41:38.680 --> 2:41:39.680]  It took me about a minute.
[2:41:39.680 --> 2:41:51.680]  Freedom's Phoenix, the active libertarian group that handed out now it's over 30,000 DVDs of the Obama deception there at the university.
[2:41:51.680 --> 2:41:55.680]  They, one of the channels is called 4409.
[2:41:55.680 --> 2:41:58.680]  And yes, a guy is wearing an orange shirt that says that.
[2:41:58.680 --> 2:42:04.680]  So if I was going 4409, 4409, and then quite a riddle, but I did.
[2:42:04.680 --> 2:42:08.680]  And my guys did pick it up and they're doing a great job.
[2:42:08.680 --> 2:42:11.680]  My crew got it up on screen.
[2:42:11.680 --> 2:42:14.680]  So yes, that is what they're angry about.
[2:42:14.680 --> 2:42:21.680]  And I guess they're mad because I'm exposing how the feds and the senators are openly announcing they're getting ready to restrict free speech on the web.
[2:42:21.680 --> 2:42:24.680]  So I appreciate your call, Tom.
[2:42:24.680 --> 2:42:32.680]  By the way, up on prisonplanet.com, Paul Watson just did several more articles today.
[2:42:32.680 --> 2:42:42.680]  They are removing the Obama fascist Obama info wars.com flyers all over Facebook, all over Myspace, all over flicker.
[2:42:42.680 --> 2:43:00.680]  They do not allow the Obama Joker images that are on the t-shirts we sell and the free flyers we have at info wars.com and see somebody who hasn't gone public kind of altered another fellow's poster and put socialism under and put it up on a few underpasses in California.
[2:43:00.680 --> 2:43:09.680]  And the media came out flipping out saying, this is racist. This is evil. This is bad. Should they be arrested?
[2:43:09.680 --> 2:43:13.680]  And so I went on air and I said, what was this two weeks ago?
[2:43:13.680 --> 2:43:17.680]  I said, we're not going to allow ourselves to be intimidated.
[2:43:17.680 --> 2:43:23.680]  Yeah, we're not going to allow them to go on the news and say socialism's the new N word or whatever.
[2:43:23.680 --> 2:43:32.680]  We're going to have a contest in legal lawful commons areas where people put up handbills and things to go out and put these up.
[2:43:32.680 --> 2:43:38.680]  And now all over the country and it's just very, very exciting.
[2:43:38.680 --> 2:43:46.680]  And it's got the feds hopping mad because other people think, wow, I could go out and put my message up on telephone polls are in commons areas.
[2:43:46.680 --> 2:43:52.680]  But what the police are saying is, look, you can put a garage sale up. You can put a pro Obama. We're not going to make a deal out of that.
[2:43:52.680 --> 2:43:57.680]  We're going to flip out and basically call it terrorism if you criticize the president.
[2:43:57.680 --> 2:44:05.680]  And they got state attorney generals investigating and they're just flipping out because they're scared of not just taking over the town hall meetings,
[2:44:05.680 --> 2:44:10.680]  not just going to the press conferences, going to city councils, county commissioners, calling to talk radio.
[2:44:10.680 --> 2:44:14.680]  They are scared of you putting up posters.
[2:44:14.680 --> 2:44:21.680]  It's the equivalent of Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson and the printing press for 10 years or more
[2:44:21.680 --> 2:44:26.680]  before 1775, 1776 really started in 1775.
[2:44:26.680 --> 2:44:31.680]  They just signed the declaration of independence in 1776, July 4th.
[2:44:31.680 --> 2:44:35.680]  People always email me going 1775 dummy at 1776.
[2:44:35.680 --> 2:44:38.680]  1776 is the full declaration.
[2:44:38.680 --> 2:44:43.680]  Lexington and Concord are April 19th, 1775.
[2:44:43.680 --> 2:44:45.680]  But side issue.
[2:44:45.680 --> 2:44:52.680]  The point is that all of this is happening.
[2:44:52.680 --> 2:44:56.680]  All of this is going on.
[2:44:56.680 --> 2:45:03.680]  And they are scared of this and then coming out trying to intimidate and scare people and now censoring it.
[2:45:03.680 --> 2:45:09.680]  Remember three days after I started this contest a few weeks ago,
[2:45:09.680 --> 2:45:15.680]  we had videos up there with tens of thousands of views that had gone on the main page of YouTube.
[2:45:15.680 --> 2:45:19.680]  And so YouTube went in and erased them saying they were racist.
[2:45:19.680 --> 2:45:25.680]  And the only thing in there was me saying Obama as the Joker, nothing about his race.
[2:45:25.680 --> 2:45:35.680]  So the message is you criticize him or you lampoon him, which is a totally American thing to do of any president.
[2:45:35.680 --> 2:45:39.680]  You know, Ronald Reagan is this as a vampire.
[2:45:39.680 --> 2:45:40.680]  George Bush is a devil.
[2:45:40.680 --> 2:45:41.680]  Bill Clinton is a demon.
[2:45:41.680 --> 2:45:43.680]  Bill Clinton is Pinocchio.
[2:45:43.680 --> 2:45:46.680]  They're saying you can't do this.
[2:45:46.680 --> 2:45:51.680]  And then they call racism, which injects race into the debate.
[2:45:51.680 --> 2:45:59.680]  But I want to commend all of you that have put the posters up and gotten them out because you've done just an amazing thing.
[2:45:59.680 --> 2:46:05.680]  You've got talk radio nationwide, mainstream news, CNN, Fox, local TV stations.
[2:46:05.680 --> 2:46:07.680]  I mean, I can't even keep track of them.
[2:46:07.680 --> 2:46:17.680]  If you just search engine the term Joker poster and click the news function of Google or start page.com or the other search engines that are out there that search under news.
[2:46:17.680 --> 2:46:18.680]  You'll just see hundreds of stories.
[2:46:18.680 --> 2:46:21.680]  I mean, I don't have time making films and doing everything else.
[2:46:21.680 --> 2:46:22.680]  I didn't even track this.
[2:46:22.680 --> 2:46:28.680]  I've been trying trying to judge all these videos.
[2:46:28.680 --> 2:46:33.680]  I think San Francisco is going to win, but I've got a bunch of videos in the inbox.
[2:46:33.680 --> 2:46:39.680]  I've got to go over and make sure I make sure because every time I think I've seen them all, I find more.
[2:46:39.680 --> 2:46:43.680]  So it looks like San Francisco is going to be announced the winter tomorrow.
[2:46:43.680 --> 2:46:50.680]  The fellows out in San Francisco for their art direction.
[2:46:50.680 --> 2:46:56.680]  They're winning for their great art direction, the way they placed them, the style of the video editing.
[2:46:56.680 --> 2:47:01.680]  That said, it would go off the number of posters and off the style and quality of the video.
[2:47:01.680 --> 2:47:07.680]  Though, you know, they didn't exactly follow the rules.
[2:47:07.680 --> 2:47:10.680]  Is that funny?
[2:47:10.680 --> 2:47:11.680]  It is somewhat funny.
[2:47:11.680 --> 2:47:17.680]  They broke the rules and did, did, did sneak up right behind police repeatedly and post them right behind.
[2:47:17.680 --> 2:47:18.680]  But that's the cops.
[2:47:18.680 --> 2:47:19.680]  See, I'm doing it.
[2:47:19.680 --> 2:47:22.680]  It's so everybody posted all over San Francisco.
[2:47:22.680 --> 2:47:26.680]  I mean, truly a form of art, all the different posters and things that are up.
[2:47:26.680 --> 2:47:34.680]  I always like to take photographs myself when I'm traveling of like a wall with just tons of, you know, handbills put up on it.
[2:47:34.680 --> 2:47:37.680]  But the question is a lot of cities don't have laws and rules against this.
[2:47:37.680 --> 2:47:42.680]  I've seen articles where newspapers are saying our city doesn't have a law against handbills.
[2:47:42.680 --> 2:47:43.680]  Pass one now.
[2:47:43.680 --> 2:47:45.680]  Stop the Joker.
[2:47:45.680 --> 2:47:50.680]  I mean, you know, these local ninnies and they are the minority, the control freaks.
[2:47:50.680 --> 2:47:57.680]  They are the minority of the people commenting writing letters, but you see them in these articles saying, you know, we can't allow this.
[2:47:57.680 --> 2:47:58.680]  It's so scary.
[2:47:58.680 --> 2:47:59.680]  It's so awful.
[2:47:59.680 --> 2:48:05.680]  It's not bad to steal 23.7 trillion.
[2:48:05.680 --> 2:48:08.680]  It's not bad to kill a million 300,000 Iraqis.
[2:48:08.680 --> 2:48:15.680]  It's not bad that major vaccines have live cancer viruses and I'm according to major German and British newspapers.
[2:48:15.680 --> 2:48:20.680]  It's not bad that the flu shots are killing large numbers of people with Gillian Bernays syndrome admitted.
[2:48:20.680 --> 2:48:26.680]  It's not bad that any of this is happening.
[2:48:26.680 --> 2:48:29.680]  None of this is bad.
[2:48:29.680 --> 2:48:35.680]  None of this is a problem.
[2:48:35.680 --> 2:48:55.680]  All that matters is that we need to learn how to grovel and be good little slaves and not put a poster up.
[2:48:55.680 --> 2:48:57.680]  The message is this is like terrorism.
[2:48:57.680 --> 2:48:58.680]  This is a hate crime.
[2:48:58.680 --> 2:49:00.680]  This is evil.
[2:49:00.680 --> 2:49:06.680]  So I want to challenge all the listeners to go absolutely wild and if you haven't been part of the contest, the contest is over now.
[2:49:06.680 --> 2:49:10.680]  I'm going to finish judging it tonight and announce it tomorrow.
[2:49:10.680 --> 2:49:18.680]  But for the first amendment, we are making some new versions of the Obama poster.
[2:49:18.680 --> 2:49:22.680]  We are making versions that say, don't drink the tap water.
[2:49:22.680 --> 2:49:24.680]  Don't take the flu shot.
[2:49:24.680 --> 2:49:30.680]  And because this is the image they say we can't post, this is the image they say we're not allowed to post.
[2:49:30.680 --> 2:49:33.680]  This is the image they're saying is taboo and bad and evil.

[2:50:04.680 --> 2:50:06.680]  I think we've got some triple X points.

[2:50:31.680 --> 2:50:32.680]  I don't know.
[2:50:32.680 --> 2:50:35.680]  We're juggling that because we're getting such a huge t-shirt.
[2:50:35.680 --> 2:50:38.680]  We have like 50 different t-shirts or more now.
[2:50:38.680 --> 2:50:41.680]  We don't really have the warehouse space to have all these different versions.
[2:50:41.680 --> 2:50:45.680]  I'm thinking we might start doing limited runs of t-shirts.
[2:50:45.680 --> 2:50:46.680]  But who knows?

[2:51:54.680 --> 2:51:59.680]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[2:51:59.680 --> 2:52:04.680]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[2:52:04.680 --> 2:52:10.680]  It's known as the Bilderberg. Could their objective be world domination?
[2:52:10.680 --> 2:52:13.680]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[2:52:13.680 --> 2:52:23.680]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[2:52:23.680 --> 2:52:29.680]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[2:52:29.680 --> 2:52:33.680]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[2:52:33.680 --> 2:52:35.680]  It's very easy to make great progress toward a world government.
[2:52:35.680 --> 2:52:38.680]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need.
[2:52:38.680 --> 2:53:04.680]  They're after power. Yes, they're after easier.
[2:53:04.680 --> 2:53:08.680]  Here we give closer and closer to the limits of our nation's power grid.
[2:53:08.680 --> 2:53:13.680]  Some say that this summer's demand for electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge,
[2:53:13.680 --> 2:53:18.680]  creating a cascade of power outages across the country, putting us all in the dark.
[2:53:18.680 --> 2:53:23.680]  Are you prepared for the next round of storm-related outages or government-created blackouts?
[2:53:23.680 --> 2:53:30.680]  Have you ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate your own private supply of electrical power?
[2:53:30.680 --> 2:53:33.680]  If so, this will be the most important information you have ever heard.
[2:53:33.680 --> 2:53:36.680]  Solar-powered generators are finally available.
[2:53:36.680 --> 2:53:41.680]  They have no moving parts to wear out or break and require absolutely no gas whatsoever.
[2:53:41.680 --> 2:53:46.680]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to MySolarBackup.com.
[2:53:46.680 --> 2:53:49.680]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[2:53:49.680 --> 2:54:16.680]  Check out MySolarBackup.com before you lose your power.
[2:54:16.680 --> 2:54:24.680]  Aha! I am back. I come in here and unceremoniously plop down.
[2:54:24.680 --> 2:54:30.680]  You know, I'm going to come back tonight in video edit, working on the film, but I'm going to go to sleep.
[2:54:30.680 --> 2:54:35.680]  As soon as this radio show is over. Isn't that an exciting thing for radios to come on here?
[2:54:35.680 --> 2:54:38.680]  This show is so exciting, I'm going to go to sleep.
[2:54:38.680 --> 2:54:45.680]  Now, I worked real hard while I was in Los Angeles for one day, and then didn't get a lot of sleep last night.
[2:54:45.680 --> 2:54:50.680]  I can even do coast-to-coast AM, be up till 4 in the morning, get three hours sleep, feel fine.
[2:54:50.680 --> 2:55:00.680]  Today, I am just beat to, you know what, I am just one of the seven dwarfs that would be sleepy.
[2:55:00.680 --> 2:55:06.680]  Let's pull up one of the seven dwarfs, sleepy, one of the seven dwarfs, and look at him.
[2:55:06.680 --> 2:55:14.680]  Did folks see the video that's up on the websites of the LaRica Unquista, reconquer the U.S. crowd at a town hall,
[2:55:14.680 --> 2:55:21.680]  physically attacking and having to be arrested by police, just peaceful town hallers?
[2:55:21.680 --> 2:55:27.680]  Because they see Obama as their president, they see him as opening up the borders,
[2:55:27.680 --> 2:55:34.680]  and as the one that's going to send the gringos home, but then they were also screaming the n-word over and over again.
[2:55:34.680 --> 2:55:45.680]  It was very, very, very scary stuff because we don't need this as a society. There I am.
[2:55:45.680 --> 2:55:51.680]  That is a gentleman. That is a gentleman. There I am.
[2:55:51.680 --> 2:55:57.680]  You know, the problem is, as soon as I get off air, though, I'm like in this cycle, then I won't be sleepy, you know what I mean?
[2:55:57.680 --> 2:56:03.680]  It's not even sleepy. I'm like super relaxed.
[2:56:03.680 --> 2:56:11.680]  And I don't know. I don't know.
[2:56:11.680 --> 2:56:16.680]  And I've just got so much work coming up. I'm just pontificating here on air.
[2:56:16.680 --> 2:56:24.680]  Look at this. Yeah, it's all over the news that they're vaccinating school kids and little babies and pregnant women
[2:56:24.680 --> 2:56:33.680]  when squalene is admitted, the other chemicals they put in here to cause even bigger autoimmune responses in pregnant women and children.
[2:56:33.680 --> 2:56:41.680]  I mean, look at this article. Swine flu, jab, link to killer nerve disease, leaked letter reveals concern of neurologist over 25 deaths in America
[2:56:41.680 --> 2:56:50.680]  just in the swine flu test in Texas and how to keep it quiet, how the people are dying.
[2:56:50.680 --> 2:56:59.680]  Let's take some phone calls. Then we've got the fellow coming on at the eight after who was out there with the AR-15 strapped his back in Arizona
[2:56:59.680 --> 2:57:04.680]  that got so much attention and scared so many people that loved being slaves of the government.
[2:57:04.680 --> 2:57:10.680]  Let's talk to Mookie, who's been holding really patiently in Colorado. Mookie, you're on the air.
[2:57:10.680 --> 2:57:16.680]  Hey, Alex, I had a possible scenario concerning this swine flu pandemic.
[2:57:16.680 --> 2:57:23.680]  Say we do get the word out. Say we do stop this vaccination or people from getting the vaccination.
[2:57:23.680 --> 2:57:27.680]  And most majority of Americans don't take it.
[2:57:27.680 --> 2:57:36.680]  Then do you think that they would come back and possibly really get another swine flu or something more deadly
[2:57:36.680 --> 2:57:46.680]  and then say, oh, see, it's your fault for not taking the vaccination. You should have done this.
[2:57:46.680 --> 2:57:52.680]  They're capable of doing anything because they believe killing us and reducing our numbers is a good thing that we're parasites.
[2:57:52.680 --> 2:58:00.680]  And so why not get rid of us? And so because that's their worldview and they've staged terror attacks, they've done so many other horrible things.
[2:58:00.680 --> 2:58:06.680]  The sky is the limit. And yes, they could, and many experts we've had on have said that,
[2:58:06.680 --> 2:58:15.680]  release something that kills a bunch of people to panic the population into taking a soft-kill weapon.
[2:58:15.680 --> 2:58:19.680]  Okay, I was kind of saying, we're most sure of that.
[2:58:19.680 --> 2:58:27.680]  I know. So what do we do about that possibility? I mean, all we can do is say this vaccine is killing people like we said it would.
[2:58:27.680 --> 2:58:33.680]  Why are they pushing to have everybody take it? What else is in there? Stay there. We'll be right back.
[2:58:58.680 --> 2:59:06.680]  Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it?
[2:59:06.680 --> 2:59:11.680]  Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick?
[2:59:11.680 --> 2:59:16.680]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[2:59:16.680 --> 2:59:23.680]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply. Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[2:59:23.680 --> 2:59:28.680]  How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones.
[2:59:28.680 --> 2:59:39.680]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[2:59:39.680 --> 2:59:54.680]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[3:00:09.680 --> 3:00:34.680]  More and more I'm just on air talking to the guests that are coming up while I'm on video and everybody watching on the internet is wondering what is he talking about?
[3:00:34.680 --> 3:00:39.680]  I was telling our guests we're coming to him at the five after. Get the lip readers in there.
[3:00:39.680 --> 3:00:46.680]  Jones is saying he really is a reptoid. We have the proof.
[3:00:46.680 --> 3:00:50.680]  I saw some really funny websites last week.
[3:00:50.680 --> 3:00:56.680]  The newest conspiracy is that I am a blood drinking reptoid from the planet Pop-Tart.
[3:00:56.680 --> 3:01:05.680]  I've now been officially found out ladies and gentlemen. I do have a big news blitz coming up in about 30 minutes.
[3:01:05.680 --> 3:01:11.680]  We're going to go over a host of issues. Some really important issues.
[3:01:11.680 --> 3:01:20.680]  The head of Greenpeace admitting they lie about the ice sheets in Greenland and the Arctic saying that they're disappearing.
[3:01:20.680 --> 3:01:31.680]  That's a complete lie that the same size they were if not bigger 30 years ago, they get smaller in the summer, bigger in the winter, smaller in the summer, bigger in the winter.
[3:01:31.680 --> 3:01:39.680]  Just like Mars has a seasonal system too and its ice caps get bigger and smaller.
[3:01:39.680 --> 3:01:53.680]  Depending on how close it is to that big hot ball called the sun, going back to Mookie, I like that name Mookie, going back to Mookie in Colorado, Mookie.
[3:01:53.680 --> 3:02:02.680]  Yes, we have made the point and you're making it now that if people don't take the flu shot, the establishment could release some other even stronger flu.
[3:02:02.680 --> 3:02:08.680]  That may be what they're planning the way they're building up and hyping and getting all these assets in line.
[3:02:08.680 --> 3:02:18.680]  I think I'll cover that before the show ends. Paul Watson has another huge confirmed mainstream news report where they admit they're building mass graves and incinerators.
[3:02:18.680 --> 3:02:21.680]  Now I was telling people that years ago and got laughed at.
[3:02:21.680 --> 3:02:26.680]  All I was doing was reading executive orders from the states and the federal government and other countries.
[3:02:26.680 --> 3:02:30.680]  So yes, this whole police state is built around pandemics.
[3:02:30.680 --> 3:02:38.680]  We know the government's been caught these eugenicists releasing pandemics over and over again.
[3:02:38.680 --> 3:02:39.680]  So I don't know.
[3:02:39.680 --> 3:02:42.680]  I just know they've got I've never seen such a buildup in assets.
[3:02:42.680 --> 3:02:44.680]  The establishment needs this.
[3:02:44.680 --> 3:02:50.680]  Governors associations are saying they don't want 400,000 troops on the streets that some type of takeovers happening.
[3:02:50.680 --> 3:02:55.680]  Dick army says a takeover is happening and they could use a stage flu event.
[3:02:55.680 --> 3:02:58.680]  And that's a big powerful former Republican leader of the house.
[3:02:58.680 --> 3:03:01.680]  You've got current Congressman Ron Paul saying that on the show.
[3:03:01.680 --> 3:03:06.680]  You've got Congressman Brown saying the same thing.
[3:03:06.680 --> 3:03:21.680]  So the good news is we've gotten the word out about this and now we're really having a real debate about this and people now are having an introduced to their thought process that government stages things and that crises are used.
[3:03:21.680 --> 3:03:24.680]  And so that's what we're getting at here.
[3:03:24.680 --> 3:03:28.680]  But I mean, I don't know what do you think is going to happen, Mookie?
[3:03:28.680 --> 3:03:43.680]  Well, I think the media might try to bust up our credibility by saying or blaming us for the outbreak that they probably say, you know, may come this winter or whatever.
[3:03:43.680 --> 3:03:46.680]  They would blame us for not taking the vaccination.
[3:03:46.680 --> 3:03:48.680]  And that's what Dr. Dina Dell does.
[3:03:48.680 --> 3:03:56.680]  I've heard him on the local radio station syndicated and he says, arrest parents that don't vaccinate their kids.
[3:03:56.680 --> 3:03:57.680]  Kick them out of school.
[3:03:57.680 --> 3:03:59.680]  They're endangering your child.
[3:03:59.680 --> 3:04:00.680]  Sue those parents.
[3:04:00.680 --> 3:04:02.680]  He tells other families to sue other families.
[3:04:02.680 --> 3:04:12.680]  If your kids had the hundreds of shots and the four shots Obama wants, not just three now, Dr. Obama, you know, that his handlers are telling him to push.
[3:04:12.680 --> 3:04:17.680]  Then if your kids had all this, how are you then not protected?
[3:04:17.680 --> 3:04:25.680]  And then I have virologist on and they say having all these different variants of flu shot is going to make a mutate in the body.
[3:04:25.680 --> 3:04:33.680]  And so they probably, a lot of evidence shows mathematically know that there's going to be mutations from this flu shot that actually cause a super flu.
[3:04:33.680 --> 3:04:42.680]  Just like AP reports, they're giving people all over the world the polio shot and it's killing them or getting them sick because it's mutating live in the body.
[3:04:42.680 --> 3:04:44.680]  So you make really good points.
[3:04:44.680 --> 3:04:46.680]  I mean, look, we're going to find out in the next few months.
[3:04:46.680 --> 3:04:54.680]  If we get the word out in a big enough way, the establishment may back off and not do this though.
[3:04:54.680 --> 3:04:55.680]  Hello friends.
[3:04:55.680 --> 3:04:59.680]  This is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[3:04:59.680 --> 3:05:01.680]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[3:05:01.680 --> 3:05:09.680]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[3:05:09.680 --> 3:05:15.680]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune and developmental system diseases.
[3:05:15.680 --> 3:05:17.680]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[3:05:17.680 --> 3:05:23.680]  The Acola blue atmospheric water generator is a low cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[3:05:23.680 --> 3:05:34.680]  The Acola blue 28 produces up to seven gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state of the art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis and ultra violent light sterilization techniques.
[3:05:34.680 --> 3:05:35.680]  That's right.
[3:05:35.680 --> 3:05:37.680]  Clean water right from the air you breathe.
[3:05:37.680 --> 3:05:52.680]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-6043 or visit Acola blue on the web at www.ecoloblu.com today.
[3:05:52.680 --> 3:06:08.680]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[3:06:08.680 --> 3:06:25.680]  There is a solution.
[3:06:25.680 --> 3:06:49.680]  It even won the award for best super food of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health major.

[3:07:25.680 --> 3:07:26.680]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[3:07:26.680 --> 3:07:31.680]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[3:07:31.680 --> 3:07:37.680]  They've been available since 1986 yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[3:07:37.680 --> 3:07:40.680]  Gold is outperformed paper investments yet no word about IRAs.
[3:07:40.680 --> 3:07:45.680]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[3:07:45.680 --> 3:07:51.680]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns call 800-686-2237.
[3:07:51.680 --> 3:08:01.680]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[3:08:01.680 --> 3:08:21.680]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[3:08:21.680 --> 3:08:25.680]  Chris is his real first name.
[3:08:25.680 --> 3:08:35.680]  I'm going to say his last name for his own privacy and we're going to put up some of the video images of him first before we play this Overman hit piece.
[3:08:35.680 --> 3:08:41.680]  We're going to put up some of the images of Chris out there.
[3:08:41.680 --> 3:08:48.680]  Clean cut, nice white shirt, black tie with it strapped to his back, perfectly done.
[3:08:48.680 --> 3:09:02.680]  They would have really gone wild with it if the gun had been in his hands or looking like he was aiming it, but it looked very military, very stowed away, very well kept.
[3:09:02.680 --> 3:09:13.680]  Not some chubby guy saying I'm the commander, I'm the real president of America, or I'm the Republic of Texas commander, and Hal Hitler or something.
[3:09:13.680 --> 3:09:20.680]  Because the feds send those people out, they send them out to look stupid, to act stupid, they've been caught.
[3:09:20.680 --> 3:09:24.680]  I told you all those years that Hal Turner was FBI.
[3:09:24.680 --> 3:09:30.680]  It's come out in every major case that the major Klan groups and white supremacist groups are run by the FBI.
[3:09:30.680 --> 3:09:34.680]  And here's the Associated Press that he was an agent provocateur.
[3:09:34.680 --> 3:09:38.680]  The FBI admits he was an informant, but saying he's not a provocateur for them.
[3:09:38.680 --> 3:09:48.680]  Look, there's no doubt that Turner was being handled by him, and it's now, like all their patsies, being set up after his website got hacked.
[3:09:48.680 --> 3:09:52.680]  And it came out that he was a fed being ordered to cause problems.
[3:09:52.680 --> 3:09:55.680]  Remember we broke that a year ago?
[3:09:55.680 --> 3:09:57.680]  He became expendable.
[3:09:57.680 --> 3:10:02.680]  But the feds through channels have let us know they're coming after us for this.
[3:10:02.680 --> 3:10:11.680]  They are really angry that I've exposed the Southern Prairie Law Center for running McVeigh and being in control of the Elohim City compound with Oklahoma City.
[3:10:11.680 --> 3:10:20.680]  When that cop killer who've been attacking me, white supremacist, see, I don't like the things Israel's doing and the corrupt things they're involved in.
[3:10:20.680 --> 3:10:23.680]  But I know a lot of other countries are involved in evil corrupt things as well.
[3:10:23.680 --> 3:10:29.680]  So just because I don't like the Zionist policies doesn't then mean I hate Jews.
[3:10:29.680 --> 3:10:38.680]  Or just like I don't like the LaRica conquista folks that believe the Southwest belongs to Mexico, but it doesn't mean I dislike Hispanics.
[3:10:38.680 --> 3:10:42.680]  The establishment wants to radicalize everybody so we can't have a real debate.
[3:10:42.680 --> 3:10:50.680]  And they do the same thing with the Obama posters that they're now removing off Flickr and Facebook and Myspace.
[3:10:50.680 --> 3:10:53.680]  And those stories are up on infowars.com right now.
[3:10:53.680 --> 3:11:01.680]  They're doing those same things saying that if you call Obama a socialist, that's co-word for the N-word.
[3:11:01.680 --> 3:11:07.680]  Which then folks hear that and think, oh my gosh, somebody must be racist if they're saying socialism.
[3:11:07.680 --> 3:11:11.680]  And people believe this if the media says it.
[3:11:11.680 --> 3:11:16.680]  So this is the kind of stuff that's going on and it's outrageous.
[3:11:16.680 --> 3:11:24.680]  It makes it even better that he's a clean cut, well-spoken and on top of it, a black man out there with his gun strapped to his back.
[3:11:24.680 --> 3:11:28.680]  Because they couldn't say racist militias were out there wanting to kill Obama.
[3:11:28.680 --> 3:11:30.680]  That's not why he was there.
[3:11:30.680 --> 3:11:33.680]  And he's going to explain why he was there with open carry.
[3:11:33.680 --> 3:11:35.680]  And Chris joins us from Arizona.
[3:11:35.680 --> 3:11:38.680]  He lives in Arizona, lives in Phoenix.
[3:11:38.680 --> 3:11:44.680]  And he's involved with Ernest Hancock and the other great folks there with freedoms, Phoenix.
[3:11:44.680 --> 3:11:49.680]  And he refused to do Fox and CNN and some other channels that day.
[3:11:49.680 --> 3:11:57.680]  So the news got some footage of him being interviewed by Hancock and CBS picked up on some of the things he had to say.
[3:11:57.680 --> 3:12:03.680]  But here he is today, uncensored, unedited live.
[3:12:03.680 --> 3:12:05.680]  Chris, thanks for joining us.
[3:12:05.680 --> 3:12:07.680]  Thanks, no problem.
[3:12:07.680 --> 3:12:09.680]  Well, you heard my little rant there.
[3:12:09.680 --> 3:12:16.680]  First off, why did you decide to do this? Tell us what it was like actually being there, you know, because this went on for hours.
[3:12:16.680 --> 3:12:21.680]  We just saw the snapshot of a few minutes of video from the Associated Press.
[3:12:21.680 --> 3:12:28.680]  I decided a long time ago that maybe I lost a lot of faith in the political process in America.
[3:12:28.680 --> 3:12:35.680]  I tried to get involved locally with the Arizona Republican Party and seeing things from the inside, seeing how things operate.
[3:12:35.680 --> 3:12:46.680]  I realized that this whole machine, this left-right Democrat-Republican machine is just a ploy to pit us against each other so that the winner is always the state.
[3:12:46.680 --> 3:12:48.680]  It's always the government.
[3:12:48.680 --> 3:12:54.680]  And I think that voting and the political process isn't going to work anymore.
[3:12:54.680 --> 3:13:03.680]  And I think it's time for people to just actually stand up and say no to these things that they're putting upon us.
[3:13:03.680 --> 3:13:08.680]  Well, absolutely. And you certainly did that in a loud and clear and decisive way.
[3:13:08.680 --> 3:13:19.680]  We've become so ninnied, so broken, so we've capitulated to hiding with our guns in our houses.
[3:13:19.680 --> 3:13:27.680]  And now I'm sure you see the articles like I do where some old man's cleaning his gun in his garage in Texas or places where you think there's a Second Amendment
[3:13:27.680 --> 3:13:36.680]  and neighbors see it and get scared and the cops come and they see a gun safe with 10 guns and 1,000 rounds and they call it an arsenal and take it and arrest him.
[3:13:36.680 --> 3:13:40.680]  And the next you hear, he's under psychological evaluation and they're drugging him.
[3:13:40.680 --> 3:13:43.680]  And you see that in Vermont. You see it in New Hampshire.
[3:13:43.680 --> 3:13:47.680]  I mean, this is going on every week at least. I see it in the news.
[3:13:47.680 --> 3:13:52.680]  And so I guess that's why the open carry movement is going, look, our guns aren't illegal.
[3:13:52.680 --> 3:13:57.680]  And I've told the story of the carpet cleaner trying to call the cops.
[3:13:57.680 --> 3:14:04.680]  When back before I had children, I had a shotgun in my broadcast studio in my house up on the wall, you know, in a gun rack.
[3:14:04.680 --> 3:14:17.680]  And the guy freaked out because he thought everything was based in television land in the dramas he watches based in New York and Chicago, like NYPD blue, where the cops come in and find a gun and arrest you.
[3:14:17.680 --> 3:14:21.680]  The public is so dumbed down. They think guns are illegal, but I'm ranting.
[3:14:21.680 --> 3:14:23.680]  I mean, give us your view on that.
[3:14:23.680 --> 3:14:27.680]  Oh, absolutely. If you were there that day, anyone that was around me all day long, you can do that.
[3:14:27.680 --> 3:14:29.680]  You can do that. You can do that. You can do that. You can do that.
[3:14:29.680 --> 3:14:32.680]  I can't. Everybody's asking the police. You're just going to let him do that.
[3:14:32.680 --> 3:14:39.680]  That's why I'm there because people don't, people don't have a clue. They have no clue.
[3:14:39.680 --> 3:14:42.680]  Now Oberman and others are trying to do the reverse now of what you're doing.
[3:14:42.680 --> 3:14:45.680]  They're saying, look, they do have guns right by the president.
[3:14:45.680 --> 3:14:54.680]  They want to kill him. They're white supremacists ban them because if they're able to do that, that's it for the second amendment.
[3:14:54.680 --> 3:14:57.680]  Yeah, well, it's not just that they're able to do that.
[3:14:57.680 --> 3:15:02.680]  If we're, if we're willing to let it happen, I mean, you can't just blame all these people that are coming after them.
[3:15:02.680 --> 3:15:08.680]  A lot of the responsibility is on us. I mean, if we have to, we have to say no where they're going to run right over it.
[3:15:08.680 --> 3:15:14.680]  Well, I agree with you. I mean, even when I'm in rural areas, no one dare ride around with their gun rack.
[3:15:14.680 --> 3:15:20.680]  And if you're walking on your, by your own property in the middle of nowhere, cops will pull over now and say, what are you doing with that shotgun?
[3:15:20.680 --> 3:15:23.680]  Well, I'm out here bird hunting. What are you doing?
[3:15:23.680 --> 3:15:33.680]  So you're right. We need to train the police and the establishment that they're not going to be allowed to just create this perception that our guns are illegal and dirty and bad.
[3:15:33.680 --> 3:15:35.680]  Absolutely.
[3:15:35.680 --> 3:15:39.680]  You weren't the only person out there who had firearms.
[3:15:39.680 --> 3:15:45.680]  I saw differing reports. I saw four, 20. I mean, how many people were out there with their firearms?
[3:15:45.680 --> 3:15:58.680]  I've heard the number like 12 a lot, but I didn't do a count. I just, I would estimate that I saw personally, maybe, um, maybe six, seven people total.
[3:15:58.680 --> 3:16:01.680]  But there could have been, I'm sure there were some people I didn't notice.
[3:16:01.680 --> 3:16:11.680]  Now, I mean, look, I could gut up to do this, but I have never done it. I mean, how do you not just go out to an event with your rifle or a handgun?
[3:16:11.680 --> 3:16:16.680]  You went to nearby where the godlike president was. They hype up all day.
[3:16:16.680 --> 3:16:18.680]  Well, you know, like there's Zeus or something.
[3:16:18.680 --> 3:16:22.680]  What was it like though when you were putting it on your back, getting out of your car?
[3:16:22.680 --> 3:16:24.680]  I mean, what was it like as you were marching up?
[3:16:24.680 --> 3:16:32.680]  What did pull, I mean, I would imagine the most dangerous point is when cops first see you walking up with a rifle, do they come over and say, what are you doing?
[3:16:32.680 --> 3:16:38.680]  Or are they so aware in Arizona because you've been letting them know you're not their slave that they backed off?
[3:16:38.680 --> 3:16:48.680]  Yeah, I think in Arizona, Arizona police know it's legal and they've all, they appear to have been trained well, so they all kind of know the story on open carry here.
[3:16:48.680 --> 3:16:59.680]  But I thought maybe what I was afraid of was the Secret Service may have just told them, well, in this case, while the president's here, you're going to have to keep people out or whatever.
[3:16:59.680 --> 3:17:04.680]  So when I, yeah, when I came out of the parking, we parked in a parking garage, like a blowground parking garage.
[3:17:04.680 --> 3:17:07.680]  When I first walked out, I was, I was very nervous.
[3:17:07.680 --> 3:17:17.680]  But I just thought as long as I don't, as long as I'm not touching it, as long as my hands are, you know, where they can see me and I walk up calmly and, you know, I walked up to a police officer.
[3:17:17.680 --> 3:17:23.680]  I nodded my head at him, he nodded back to me and I put, well, I guess, I guess they know the deal there.
[3:17:23.680 --> 3:17:26.680]  Well, you just are a trailblazer, my friend.
[3:17:26.680 --> 3:17:31.680]  You're literally for the Second Amendment rights that are some of the most basic.
[3:17:31.680 --> 3:17:33.680]  And I'm not just saying this because you're black.
[3:17:33.680 --> 3:17:36.680]  I mean, it fits the analogy.
[3:17:36.680 --> 3:17:42.680]  You're like the first person to go in and so is the fellow up in New Hampshire.
[3:17:42.680 --> 3:17:48.680]  You're like the first people to go in and sit down at a lunch counter and say, you're going to, you know, serve me.
[3:17:48.680 --> 3:17:50.680]  And it's that type of courage.
[3:17:50.680 --> 3:17:53.680]  It's going to get our Second Amendment back.
[3:17:53.680 --> 3:17:55.680]  Yeah, I hope so.
[3:17:55.680 --> 3:17:56.680]  Yeah.
[3:17:56.680 --> 3:18:08.680]  Well, the man in New Hampshire definitely, definitely helped help me out, helped me to feel a lot better about it because I saw, I'm thinking about, am I going to get, what kind of trouble am I going to get into doing this?
[3:18:08.680 --> 3:18:13.680]  And after seeing that he did it and there were really no, nothing, nothing very bad happened.
[3:18:13.680 --> 3:18:16.680]  That kind of put my mind at ease a little more.
[3:18:16.680 --> 3:18:26.680]  Well, the social engineers would love to set you up and beat you up, but they realize that if they make an example out of you or anybody else, other people are going to start doing it and they're going to lose.
[3:18:26.680 --> 3:18:28.680]  They don't want to make you a martyr.
[3:18:28.680 --> 3:18:29.680]  Yeah.
[3:18:29.680 --> 3:18:35.680]  But they will dig around and try to find something on you or exaggerate something or twist something.
[3:18:35.680 --> 3:18:38.680]  But you've just done a fabulous job.
[3:18:38.680 --> 3:18:41.680]  I mean, I mean, that's all I can say is it's just beautiful.
[3:18:41.680 --> 3:18:43.680]  I mean, what ran through your mind then?
[3:18:43.680 --> 3:18:45.680]  I mean, how did you decide to do this?
[3:18:45.680 --> 3:18:50.680]  I wanted to do, do this, that one of the Tea Party events.
[3:18:50.680 --> 3:18:54.680]  And I didn't have a sling for my AR yet.
[3:18:54.680 --> 3:18:57.680]  So I just carry concealed like I normally do.
[3:18:57.680 --> 3:19:04.680]  And I went to the Tea Parties and, and I, when, when I've heard that Obama was coming to town, I just thought, well, here's my chance.
[3:19:04.680 --> 3:19:08.680]  I can, I can go, all I have to do is go find a sling and I can go do this.
[3:19:08.680 --> 3:19:10.680]  That, that, that kind of event instead.
[3:19:10.680 --> 3:19:13.680]  And I just did it.
[3:19:13.680 --> 3:19:15.680]  Well, you know, that's another huge point you make.
[3:19:15.680 --> 3:19:18.680]  People are already walking around with concealed everywhere.
[3:19:18.680 --> 3:19:21.680]  What is it so scary about it in the open?
[3:19:21.680 --> 3:19:28.680]  Under our common law, it was a weapon concealed that people freaked out about back when we were freely free.
[3:19:28.680 --> 3:19:44.680]  People, people freaked out over a hidden weapon, not one out in the open because crooks, bad guys, highwaymen, freebooters, carried it, hidden, free men, good guys carried them in the open.
[3:19:44.680 --> 3:19:45.680]  Stay with us.
[3:19:45.680 --> 3:19:48.680]  This is amazing information with Chris.
[3:19:48.680 --> 3:20:02.680]  He's quite a hero to the Second Amendment.
[3:20:02.680 --> 3:20:14.680]  Aerial spraying, chemtrails, the modified atmosphere, heavy metals and pesticides, carcinogens and chemical fibers all falling from the sky.

[3:21:24.680 --> 3:21:29.680]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[3:23:19.680 --> 3:23:29.680]  Simply put 10 drops in the water you drink to raise the pH to a healthy level. Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[3:23:29.680 --> 3:23:36.680]  Disease organisms like bacteria, viruses and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment.

[3:24:14.680 --> 3:24:30.680]  Chris is the gentleman who went out there with that AR-15 strapped to his back and laid it out.
[3:24:30.680 --> 3:24:40.680]  In fact, there's a clip in the AP video. It's actually in one of the YouTube videos where a lady comes over and says,
[3:24:40.680 --> 3:24:47.680]  I'm offended. That makes me uncomfortable. Your gun. Can you repeat here what you said to her and then elaborate on that?
[3:24:47.680 --> 3:24:53.680]  Because I think that really illustrates it beautifully.
[3:24:53.680 --> 3:25:02.680]  Boy, I couldn't recall everything from memory, but she seemed to be like your average person that doesn't really understand firearm culture in America.
[3:25:02.680 --> 3:25:08.680]  She was just afraid and she was nice. We had a civil discussion.
[3:25:08.680 --> 3:25:10.680]  Oh, come on. She was a dingbat.
[3:25:10.680 --> 3:25:19.680]  No, she wasn't. She wasn't mean. I wish people knew a little more than what she knows, but you can't blame her too much.
[3:25:19.680 --> 3:25:23.680]  She was perfectly polite and everything.
[3:25:23.680 --> 3:25:25.680]  Well, I mean, she came over and said, that makes me uncomfortable.
[3:25:25.680 --> 3:25:32.680]  And you said, well, there was a time when the color of my skin would make you uncomfortable. And I think that really shut her up.
[3:25:32.680 --> 3:25:40.680]  Yeah. Yeah, a little bit. I think people need to come to terms with some fears in life.
[3:25:40.680 --> 3:25:45.680]  If you have freedom in this country, there's going to be danger that goes along with it.
[3:25:45.680 --> 3:25:52.680]  And you've got to just learn how to deal with that. You can't just become hysterical about it and freak out.
[3:25:52.680 --> 3:25:58.680]  Yeah, that was the other great point you made, that we have hundreds of thousands of people die every year in car wrecks.
[3:25:58.680 --> 3:26:02.680]  We still drive cars. I mean, this is part of life.
[3:26:02.680 --> 3:26:08.680]  If you're just nittying afraid of things all day, you're not going to have any life worth living.
[3:26:08.680 --> 3:26:14.680]  There is no safe life to live. And the government uses the name of safety to take all our freedoms.
[3:26:14.680 --> 3:26:18.680]  And we end up not even being safe. The cities that have the gun control.
[3:26:18.680 --> 3:26:22.680]  In fact, that one lady's like, well, you can't have a gun in DC.
[3:26:22.680 --> 3:26:25.680]  And you're like, yeah, they got the highest crime rate, lady.
[3:26:25.680 --> 3:26:28.680]  Yeah.
[3:26:28.680 --> 3:26:31.680]  But listen, tell, go ahead.
[3:26:31.680 --> 3:26:38.680]  Oh, I had another discussion with a man who said, you know, well, how would you, how would you, because I, you know, I don't consider,
[3:26:38.680 --> 3:26:42.680]  I told, we got into a debate about libertarianism and I told him, I'm not a libertarian.
[3:26:42.680 --> 3:26:45.680]  And, you know, if I had to put a label on myself, I guess it would be an anarchist.
[3:26:45.680 --> 3:26:51.680]  And he said, well, how would you protect yourself from, from like a terrorist attack, like a Timothy McVeigh type of attack?
[3:26:51.680 --> 3:26:57.680]  Well, how did the governor protect people from a Timothy McVeigh type of attack?
[3:26:57.680 --> 3:27:00.680]  Yeah, they can't do it. In fact, they actually did it.
[3:27:00.680 --> 3:27:08.680]  So yeah, they still did it. So we empower these government agents to protect us and we trust that they're going to use that power to protect us.
[3:27:08.680 --> 3:27:12.680]  And then they fail all the time anyway. So it's, it's, it's silly.
[3:27:12.680 --> 3:27:16.680]  Well, that's what's so asinine is there's a lot of great cops. They put their lives on the line.
[3:27:16.680 --> 3:27:22.680]  It's a tough job in many cases, but the average 911 call takes like 11 and a half minutes.
[3:27:22.680 --> 3:27:28.680]  In fact, guys, search engine that average 911 call, but I think it's, it changes every year.
[3:27:28.680 --> 3:27:34.680]  But last time I saw it, it was rather 12 minutes. Folks, if somebody's breaking in your house wanting to come kill you, you don't have 12 minutes.
[3:27:34.680 --> 3:27:40.680]  You don't have 30 seconds. And then the police argue, we don't have to protect you.
[3:27:40.680 --> 3:27:51.680]  It's not our job to protect you. And that's actually true under the common law. They are to respond after a crime has been committed to bring the people to justice before a jury of their peers.
[3:27:51.680 --> 3:28:04.680]  The police are hired by us to bring the criminal to us because we will sit in judgment as the sovereigns.
[3:28:04.680 --> 3:28:16.680]  Your comments on that, Chris. I'm sorry. I, I didn't, I kind of, I'm distracted me here. I didn't hear that last part.
[3:28:16.680 --> 3:28:20.680]  I understand you got somebody talking to you. Look, specifically, you were pretty wound up when you were out there.
[3:28:20.680 --> 3:28:28.680]  I mean, not a lot, but compared to now you were wound up. Relax, my friend. Tell us your bottom line. Was it empowering?
[3:28:28.680 --> 3:28:34.680]  Oh, yeah, it was empowering and it was inspirational too, just to realize, you know, that I could still do this in America.
[3:28:34.680 --> 3:28:45.680]  That here's a country where you can go, you know, you can go right up to the tyrants front door wherever he is and, you know, stand there with your weapon and not get stomped out.
[3:28:45.680 --> 3:28:48.680]  You know, it was kind of inspirational.
[3:28:48.680 --> 3:28:56.680]  Well, what did Frederick Douglass say to paraphrase? He said, rights are not given, they're taken.
[3:28:56.680 --> 3:29:07.680]  Exactly. And that's what this comes down to is that if we act like a bunch of little, little cowards, we're going to be bent over a barrel and the establishment's going to have their way with us.
[3:29:07.680 --> 3:29:19.680]  We must stand up to bullies or we do get enslaved. And the poor people that want to be cowardly slaves, they think lying down to corruption keeps them safe.
[3:29:19.680 --> 3:29:32.680]  That actually brings the pain, brings the tyranny. I want to come back and take calls for you at 1-800-259-9231, specifically for our guests, 800-259-9231.
[3:29:32.680 --> 3:29:42.680]  And we're also going to get into some more stories of things we don't see on video of people that confronted them or things that happened.
[3:29:42.680 --> 3:29:45.680]  We'll be right back with our guest, Open Carrot.
[3:29:45.680 --> 3:29:52.680]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:30:15.680 --> 3:30:21.680]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[3:30:21.680 --> 3:30:28.680]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storms season is here again. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[3:30:28.680 --> 3:30:33.680]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[3:30:33.680 --> 3:30:39.680]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[3:30:39.680 --> 3:30:45.680]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.

[3:31:28.680 --> 3:31:34.680]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.

[3:31:55.680 --> 3:31:58.680]  Hello. This is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[3:31:58.680 --> 3:32:03.680]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[3:32:03.680 --> 3:32:09.680]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[3:32:09.680 --> 3:32:13.680]  Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it?
[3:32:13.680 --> 3:32:18.680]  Now or after the battle starts. When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification?
[3:32:18.680 --> 3:32:21.680]  Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick?
[3:32:21.680 --> 3:32:26.680]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[3:32:26.680 --> 3:32:30.680]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[3:32:30.680 --> 3:32:34.680]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[3:32:34.680 --> 3:32:39.680]  How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones.
[3:32:39.680 --> 3:32:46.680]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633
[3:32:46.680 --> 3:32:54.680]  or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com. Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[3:32:54.680 --> 3:33:04.680]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central Standard Time.
[3:33:04.680 --> 3:33:09.680]  We're here in backland abbreviated transmission four to six p.m. on Sundays.
[3:33:09.680 --> 3:33:14.680]  Don't forget the podcast that suckers up to 167,000 people
[3:33:14.680 --> 3:33:21.680]  downloading it each and every day and growing free podcast at infowars.com right there on the listen page.

[3:33:33.680 --> 3:33:39.680]  We have Chris who made international news, the British were freaking out, the Europeans.
[3:33:39.680 --> 3:33:45.680]  Think of how crazy this is. The humans have been so trained that cops, black uniforms, cameras,
[3:33:45.680 --> 3:33:50.680]  SWAT teams, checkpoints, all the things that historically should freak us out.
[3:33:50.680 --> 3:33:54.680]  You shouldn't be scared of a citizen with a weapon like in Switzerland.
[3:33:54.680 --> 3:33:57.680]  You see men riding along with their guns on their backs, little kids with guns.
[3:33:57.680 --> 3:34:02.680]  Never get invaded. Everybody's scared of them. Peaceful, lowest crime rate in the world.
[3:34:02.680 --> 3:34:08.680]  Our model really came off the Swiss if you really want to know.
[3:34:08.680 --> 3:34:12.680]  They are just so afraid because we've been gilded.
[3:34:12.680 --> 3:34:17.680]  It's like a nation of, and they're like, it's so scary.
[3:34:17.680 --> 3:34:22.680]  People are posting Obama posters. Look at the Hayes County free press.
[3:34:22.680 --> 3:34:27.680]  It's a good newspaper, pretty good newspaper in Hayes County.
[3:34:27.680 --> 3:34:30.680]  This is a place. It's a CPS happy hunting ground down there.
[3:34:30.680 --> 3:34:40.680]  Kidnapping kids, but the newspaper says freedom of hate speech.
[3:34:40.680 --> 3:34:46.680]  I'm being a little sarcastic about it being a pretty good newspaper, but the point is,
[3:34:46.680 --> 3:34:52.680]  this is right south of Austin and it says area resident Chuck Lutrick is a Republican,
[3:34:52.680 --> 3:34:57.680]  but he says he's outraged and sickened by the flyer stuck to telephone poles around Kyle,
[3:34:57.680 --> 3:35:03.680]  putting President Obama's face distorted into a gruesome Joker mask with the words
[3:35:03.680 --> 3:35:07.680]  socialism and fascism underneath. This is appalling.
[3:35:07.680 --> 3:35:12.680]  Lutrick said, I serve in the military. That's my commander in chief.
[3:35:12.680 --> 3:35:19.680]  That's your commander in chief. Well, it's our right and duty to criticize your commander
[3:35:19.680 --> 3:35:25.680]  and your commander. By the way, they go and pick and choose the few people,
[3:35:25.680 --> 3:35:29.680]  the very few that are actually against this.
[3:35:29.680 --> 3:35:32.680]  You go look at the comments on all these newspapers and TV stations.
[3:35:32.680 --> 3:35:36.680]  Again, it's one out of 10 is against us.
[3:35:36.680 --> 3:35:41.680]  In order to awaken the people in Obama's agenda, Alex is organizing a contest
[3:35:41.680 --> 3:35:45.680]  centered around the Obama as the Joker poster that has Democrats and Obamanoids
[3:35:45.680 --> 3:35:49.680]  going ballistic Jones States on his website info wars.com.
[3:35:49.680 --> 3:35:53.680]  Locals began reporting flyers late last week primarily plastered around Kyle,
[3:35:53.680 --> 3:35:57.680]  but they're part of a nationwide campaign spearheaded by conspiracy theorist
[3:35:57.680 --> 3:35:59.680]  and radio host Alex Jones.
[3:35:59.680 --> 3:36:02.680]  And then it just goes into saying I'm basically a hate criminal.
[3:36:02.680 --> 3:36:07.680]  There's the headline freedom of speech, freedom of hate speech.
[3:36:07.680 --> 3:36:11.680]  So it's it's it's illegal going back to Chris.
[3:36:11.680 --> 3:36:18.680]  Chris, isn't it really the media saying it's racist or hate to criticize the president?
[3:36:18.680 --> 3:36:20.680]  Aren't they making it a racial issue?
[3:36:20.680 --> 3:36:24.680]  Aren't they injecting race to divide and conquer?
[3:36:24.680 --> 3:36:26.680]  Absolutely. Absolutely.
[3:36:26.680 --> 3:36:30.680]  I don't even believe it when people throw out the label of racist nowadays.
[3:36:30.680 --> 3:36:35.680]  I want to see what that person is saying because chances are they're saying something
[3:36:35.680 --> 3:36:38.680]  that people don't want me to hear and they have no and they have no way to
[3:36:38.680 --> 3:36:39.680]  refute what they're saying.
[3:36:39.680 --> 3:36:43.680]  So they just slap this label of racist on them because you know your sheep,
[3:36:43.680 --> 3:36:46.680]  the sheep out there will just have an emotional response to that.
[3:36:46.680 --> 3:36:50.680]  And they'll they'll they'll they'll they'll shut them out, you know.
[3:36:50.680 --> 3:36:55.680]  So when I hear racist, I actually want to hear what the person has to say.
[3:36:55.680 --> 3:36:57.680]  Absolutely.
[3:36:57.680 --> 3:36:59.680]  Well, it's certainly a political power.
[3:36:59.680 --> 3:37:03.680]  I mean, black leaders, white leaders, Hispanic leaders, Asian leaders do it
[3:37:03.680 --> 3:37:07.680]  because if you come out and make stuff tribal, we're designed to act that way
[3:37:07.680 --> 3:37:10.680]  at a fundamental level.
[3:37:10.680 --> 3:37:12.680]  People can get a lot of power out of that.
[3:37:12.680 --> 3:37:17.680]  But at the same time, how do we not like take the open borders?
[3:37:17.680 --> 3:37:20.680]  And I know you're saying you're past libertarian and anarchy level.
[3:37:20.680 --> 3:37:25.680]  But as long as we have borders and governments, they are clearly using the
[3:37:25.680 --> 3:37:29.680]  migrant population to drive down wages and balkanize.
[3:37:29.680 --> 3:37:34.680]  But then if I just come out and engage in this, it almost feeds into it.
[3:37:34.680 --> 3:37:35.680]  So what do you do?
[3:37:35.680 --> 3:37:39.680]  Just let the New World Order do whatever they want.
[3:37:39.680 --> 3:37:42.680]  Boy, I kind of get lost there.
[3:37:42.680 --> 3:37:45.680]  I'm sorry.
[3:37:45.680 --> 3:37:46.680]  I kind of know.
[3:37:46.680 --> 3:37:47.680]  No, no, no.
[3:37:47.680 --> 3:37:49.680]  I mean, it's a very, very, very complex issue.
[3:37:49.680 --> 3:37:54.680]  So I mean, I don't blame you for, I mean, I mean, I'm dumbfounded too,
[3:37:54.680 --> 3:37:57.680]  because I don't want to go around fighting with people.
[3:37:57.680 --> 3:38:00.680]  I don't want to go around, but I played a video earlier.
[3:38:00.680 --> 3:38:01.680]  I don't know if you've seen it.
[3:38:01.680 --> 3:38:07.680]  It's up on prisonplanet.com of people at town hall meetings saying they don't want
[3:38:07.680 --> 3:38:11.680]  to go to healthcare, being screamed at, they're racist.
[3:38:11.680 --> 3:38:17.680]  And the Hispanics are running around with Mexican flags screaming and yelling,
[3:38:17.680 --> 3:38:18.680]  saying, this is our country.
[3:38:18.680 --> 3:38:20.680]  We're going to kick you white people out.
[3:38:20.680 --> 3:38:22.680]  And then screaming inward at black people.
[3:38:22.680 --> 3:38:25.680]  I mean, it just seems like insanity.
[3:38:25.680 --> 3:38:29.680]  I think this whole immigration thing is like, it's a straw man, you know,
[3:38:29.680 --> 3:38:33.680]  if we could get the government out of our economy and out of our lives,
[3:38:33.680 --> 3:38:36.680]  we would all live such prosperous, easy life lives.
[3:38:36.680 --> 3:38:39.680]  We wouldn't care about immigration policy.
[3:38:39.680 --> 3:38:43.680]  We wouldn't care about who was coming and who was going and all this other stuff.
[3:38:43.680 --> 3:38:47.680]  So I think that's what we should be focusing on instead of whether or not
[3:38:47.680 --> 3:38:50.680]  certain people can come here or not, you know.
[3:38:50.680 --> 3:38:55.680]  It's just that the issue is that we do have this big government system where we
[3:38:55.680 --> 3:38:58.680]  have to have the insurance, the ID cards and everything.
[3:38:58.680 --> 3:39:02.680]  And then the illegals are just above it all doing whatever they want.
[3:39:02.680 --> 3:39:06.680]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, so let's get rid of, let's get rid of all these,
[3:39:06.680 --> 3:39:12.680]  all these welfare programs and let's get rid of that stuff that it's a non-issue.
[3:39:12.680 --> 3:39:14.680]  Well, I agree with you.
[3:39:14.680 --> 3:39:15.680]  No, no, I agree with you.
[3:39:15.680 --> 3:39:17.680]  And that's exactly what they were there mad about.
[3:39:17.680 --> 3:39:18.680]  They want the free healthcare.
[3:39:18.680 --> 3:39:19.680]  It's not free.
[3:39:19.680 --> 3:39:21.680]  Don't they understand that?
[3:39:21.680 --> 3:39:22.680]  No, they don't.
[3:39:22.680 --> 3:39:25.680]  They actually don't because every time you ask them who's going to pay for it,
[3:39:25.680 --> 3:39:27.680]  they go, well, why are you always concerned about money?
[3:39:27.680 --> 3:39:30.680]  And it's just totally removed from their mind.
[3:39:30.680 --> 3:39:34.680]  I'm starting to believe they really do think that the government just produces
[3:39:34.680 --> 3:39:38.680]  wealth out of nowhere because that's how they act.
[3:39:38.680 --> 3:39:45.680]  As somebody who's a black man, when you see the media saying, and of course
[3:39:45.680 --> 3:39:48.680]  they know it isn't true, they just brutally are using it cold bloodedly
[3:39:48.680 --> 3:39:52.680]  like Alan Key said last week as a political weapon.
[3:39:52.680 --> 3:39:56.680]  But when you just hear them say, racist, racist, racist, racist.
[3:39:56.680 --> 3:39:59.680]  I mean, if you had people call you racist because you don't like Obama?
[3:39:59.680 --> 3:40:03.680]  Well, I've had people call me racist all my life because I don't fit into their
[3:40:03.680 --> 3:40:07.680]  little box of what they think, you know, an African American or black or whatever,
[3:40:07.680 --> 3:40:10.680]  you know, whatever the P.C. term is nowadays.
[3:40:10.680 --> 3:40:12.680]  If I don't fit into their little box, they call me a racist.
[3:40:12.680 --> 3:40:14.680]  And I look at it like a badge of honor.
[3:40:14.680 --> 3:40:18.680]  I must be saying something right if they're labeling me as a racist.
[3:40:18.680 --> 3:40:21.680]  What do they call you, a self-loathing black person?
[3:40:21.680 --> 3:40:22.680]  They'll call me racist.
[3:40:22.680 --> 3:40:26.680]  Uncle Tom, they'll go, oh, you're the kind of, you must be one of those kind of black
[3:40:26.680 --> 3:40:31.680]  people that would join the KKK or, you know, this ridiculous, ridiculous lunacy.
[3:40:31.680 --> 3:40:34.680]  And I think it's hilarious because they have to resort.
[3:40:34.680 --> 3:40:38.680]  They have to resort to insults like that because they cannot, they cannot argue.
[3:40:38.680 --> 3:40:41.680]  They have no argument to bring the table.
[3:40:41.680 --> 3:40:42.680]  Yeah.
[3:40:42.680 --> 3:40:46.680]  They must think the Chappelle piece is real when he plays the part of the black.
[3:40:46.680 --> 3:40:47.680]  Yeah, I guess.
[3:40:47.680 --> 3:40:48.680]  I guess so.
[3:40:48.680 --> 3:40:49.680]  You ever seen that?
[3:40:49.680 --> 3:40:50.680]  It's pretty funny.
[3:40:50.680 --> 3:40:51.680]  Oh yeah.
[3:40:51.680 --> 3:40:52.680]  That's kind of funny.
[3:40:52.680 --> 3:40:53.680]  Yeah.
[3:40:53.680 --> 3:40:59.680]  Tell me, tell me what position that I've, you know, tell me one argument I've made
[3:40:59.680 --> 3:41:00.680]  that's a racist argument.
[3:41:00.680 --> 3:41:05.680]  Stop, stop just having a gut reaction and, you know, labeling me as labeling some group
[3:41:05.680 --> 3:41:09.680]  as a racist group because you don't like what their position is.
[3:41:09.680 --> 3:41:11.680]  Tell me what is racist about their position.
[3:41:11.680 --> 3:41:13.680]  And I haven't heard any answers yet.
[3:41:13.680 --> 3:41:19.680]  Well, I've also found that the so-called left are a bunch of control freak eugenicists.
[3:41:19.680 --> 3:41:24.680]  You know, if you're talking about an actual, even mid-level policy person, they're all
[3:41:24.680 --> 3:41:25.680]  the same.
[3:41:25.680 --> 3:41:30.680]  And Margaret Sanger and all of it, I actually find they're the real racist who are smart
[3:41:30.680 --> 3:41:31.680]  enough.
[3:41:31.680 --> 3:41:32.680]  Sorry, go ahead.
[3:41:32.680 --> 3:41:33.680]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[3:41:33.680 --> 3:41:39.680]  I think, I think, I think like, for example, the Democratic Party, in my opinion, the Democratic
[3:41:39.680 --> 3:41:42.680]  Party looks at black people in this country as like purchase votes.
[3:41:42.680 --> 3:41:43.680]  You know, these are my voters.
[3:41:43.680 --> 3:41:44.680]  These are my votes.
[3:41:44.680 --> 3:41:45.680]  I own them.
[3:41:45.680 --> 3:41:49.680]  I've propagandized them for so long that they're mine.
[3:41:49.680 --> 3:41:53.680]  And if you try and open up their mind a little bit, they're going to label you as a racist
[3:41:53.680 --> 3:41:55.680]  so that people won't hear what you have to say.
[3:41:55.680 --> 3:41:58.680]  So I think they're the real racist.
[3:41:58.680 --> 3:41:59.680]  Well, I agree.
[3:41:59.680 --> 3:42:07.680]  I mean, when Keith Oberman and Chris Matthews and Carlos Watson and all these guys get up
[3:42:07.680 --> 3:42:08.680]  on TV every day.
[3:42:08.680 --> 3:42:10.680]  I mean, every time I turn it on, they're singing.
[3:42:10.680 --> 3:42:12.680]  I probably watch it twice a week.
[3:42:12.680 --> 3:42:15.680]  It must just be wall to wall.
[3:42:15.680 --> 3:42:16.680]  I've seen CNN that it's racist.
[3:42:16.680 --> 3:42:22.400]  And here's the local paper, Freedom of Hate Speech.
[3:42:22.400 --> 3:42:27.920]  And it's saying, and I've got national Spanish TV saying arrest me that it's racist.
[3:42:27.920 --> 3:42:33.560]  I mean, in America, I am being told that I need to be arrested.
[3:42:33.560 --> 3:42:38.680]  And then they've got the state attorney general preparing for felony charges against somebody
[3:42:38.680 --> 3:42:43.480]  for sticking them on telephone polls, but then Obama can be in the Washington Post saying,
[3:42:43.480 --> 3:42:49.680]  stick my posters and my campaign signs on stop signs.
[3:42:49.680 --> 3:42:52.680]  I mean, is that not hypocrisy?
[3:42:52.680 --> 3:42:54.680]  Sounds like it to me.
[3:42:54.680 --> 3:42:58.840]  Well, there's a lot of questions I could throw out at you, but I got a bunch of calls specifically
[3:42:58.840 --> 3:43:00.200]  for you.
[3:43:00.200 --> 3:43:04.800]  We've got on the line, the gentleman who was out there with his AR 15.
[3:43:04.800 --> 3:43:09.280]  This woman walks over the poster woman for dingbats of the planet.
[3:43:09.280 --> 3:43:12.200]  I don't mean to be mean, but I mean, I'm just so sick of idiots.
[3:43:12.200 --> 3:43:19.040]  And she comes over and she comes over and goes, you've got a fully automatic AK-47.
[3:43:19.040 --> 3:43:23.080]  And they always act like fully automatic is like a hydrogen bomb.
[3:43:23.080 --> 3:43:32.040]  I mean, if I wouldn't want a full auto assault rifle, 30 rounds on single shot, if you're
[3:43:32.040 --> 3:43:37.080]  trying to actually aim, you know, you want the 30 rounds, you don't want, you want to
[3:43:37.080 --> 3:43:40.040]  be pulled the trigger and shoot.
[3:43:40.040 --> 3:43:44.200]  Now if you had a heavy gun in a machine gun placement, where you were going to have human
[3:43:44.200 --> 3:43:49.160]  wave attacks, then then a belt fed machine gun would be good.
[3:43:49.160 --> 3:43:54.560]  But this, this worship of full auto and the power of it and how the media always shows
[3:43:54.560 --> 3:43:56.920]  handguns and calls them automatic weapons.
[3:43:56.920 --> 3:44:01.440]  And it's this, this magicalness of, of, I mean, it's all psychological warfare and she
[3:44:01.440 --> 3:44:05.720]  walks over and she goes, you're AK-47's full auto.
[3:44:05.720 --> 3:44:10.520]  You go, well, it's an AR-15 and it's, it's semi-automatic and, and she's just such a,
[3:44:10.520 --> 3:44:13.200]  I mean, she's just such a moron.
[3:44:13.200 --> 3:44:18.480]  No, I mean, these women will send their kids off to school, they're, they're, they're young
[3:44:18.480 --> 3:44:22.680]  men telling them, don't over fight back if somebody attacks you.
[3:44:22.680 --> 3:44:28.160]  They send their daughters to be, you know, raped and killed in college and never, I mean,
[3:44:28.160 --> 3:44:29.800]  these women all the time don't have guns.
[3:44:29.800 --> 3:44:32.880]  You better believe my daughters, when they move out of the house, they're going to know
[3:44:32.880 --> 3:44:33.880]  how to use guns.
[3:44:33.880 --> 3:44:38.640]  And if somebody starts busting in their door, they are going to kill you and, and, and,
[3:44:38.640 --> 3:44:42.120]  but no, the feminists are like, no, you got to make sure women are victims.
[3:44:42.120 --> 3:44:43.120]  I'm sorry.
[3:44:43.120 --> 3:44:44.120]  Go ahead.
[3:44:44.120 --> 3:44:45.120]  Oh, I didn't, no, I didn't think.
[3:44:45.120 --> 3:44:48.320]  No, no, I mean, I want you to comment on what I was just saying.
[3:44:48.320 --> 3:44:50.720]  Oh, I mean, yeah, I agree.
[3:44:50.720 --> 3:44:55.600]  Uh, you know, what else is funny, it's like every, every woman I've ever met that arms
[3:44:55.600 --> 3:45:01.200]  herself and, and, you know, takes pride in her ability to defend herself was always a
[3:45:01.200 --> 3:45:02.960]  really, you know, just a really cool chick.
[3:45:02.960 --> 3:45:06.400]  I mean, I don't know what, I don't know what it is about.
[3:45:06.400 --> 3:45:10.600]  You know, you put a, you put a gun in a woman's hand and teacher had to shoot it and a lot
[3:45:10.600 --> 3:45:12.400]  of changes take place.
[3:45:12.400 --> 3:45:15.880]  They become empowered and that's the kind of woman we want.
[3:45:15.880 --> 3:45:20.440]  Strong, smart women that are teamed up with their men that understand the systems against
[3:45:20.440 --> 3:45:21.440]  the family.
[3:45:21.440 --> 3:45:25.920]  Instead, the women are like, I'm with the government and I'm going to show you and literally
[3:45:25.920 --> 3:45:30.600]  they've become the house slave and they actually have government manuals on this.
[3:45:30.600 --> 3:45:33.480]  The woman's in the house and this wasn't just with blacks.
[3:45:33.480 --> 3:45:37.800]  The Romans did this when they would enslave a German or French tribe, the Gauls or the
[3:45:37.800 --> 3:45:42.920]  vandals or the others, the, the Austrians, the Austria Goths, they would grab them and
[3:45:42.920 --> 3:45:47.840]  put the men out in the barn and the women inside and teach the women how to be over
[3:45:47.840 --> 3:45:48.840]  the men.
[3:45:48.840 --> 3:45:53.360]  And those systems, whoa, I haven't heard of that.
[3:45:53.360 --> 3:45:58.200]  Well, that's what feminism is and Gloria Steinem admits she CIA in her own book and
[3:45:58.200 --> 3:46:02.360]  was there to break the family up and we're on to their scam and there's nothing better
[3:46:02.360 --> 3:46:05.680]  than an empowered woman, super sexy.
[3:46:05.680 --> 3:46:10.840]  Let's go ahead and I mean, I hate these cowardly chicken neck domesticated little, little women
[3:46:10.840 --> 3:46:14.920]  that think their power is hating their man and putting their kids on Prozac and Ritalin
[3:46:14.920 --> 3:46:20.560]  and lording around the house with their weak husbands, groveling, those women are totally
[3:46:20.560 --> 3:46:21.560]  unhappy.
[3:46:21.560 --> 3:46:24.800]  But see, they pimp you and then the state pimps them.
[3:46:24.800 --> 3:46:28.120]  Let's go ahead and take a call from Jake in Texas.
[3:46:28.120 --> 3:46:32.440]  You're on with one hell of an American, one hell of a person who loves liberty.
[3:46:32.440 --> 3:46:36.320]  You're on the air with a man who had the hour 15 strapped to his back as the liberty and
[3:46:36.320 --> 3:46:38.160]  freedom just spreads across the country.
[3:46:38.160 --> 3:46:39.160]  Go ahead.
[3:46:39.160 --> 3:46:40.160]  Yes, sir.
[3:46:40.160 --> 3:46:41.160]  Yes, sir.
[3:46:41.160 --> 3:46:43.160]  What a good looking gentleman you look like, my friend.
[3:46:43.160 --> 3:46:47.640]  I got to say, I got to say you, your performance was exemplary.
[3:46:47.640 --> 3:46:48.640]  I have to say.
[3:46:48.640 --> 3:46:51.640]  Keep your hands off him now.
[3:46:51.640 --> 3:46:57.920]  I have to say some of my stuff, you know, you know, one more thing you should have said,
[3:46:57.920 --> 3:47:01.400]  you should have said, you know, if she came up to you, you know, try to neuter you, you
[3:47:01.400 --> 3:47:06.400]  know, she just couldn't get like what I mean, the men with guns and you should have just
[3:47:06.400 --> 3:47:10.000]  looked at her and give her a wink, you know, that's how we do it.
[3:47:10.000 --> 3:47:11.000]  Exactly.
[3:47:11.000 --> 3:47:25.960]  You should have said, man, uh, you know, we're actually here to defend the president against
[3:47:25.960 --> 3:47:30.880]  assassination from these crazy healthcare maniacs or just buying out what's going on.
[3:47:30.880 --> 3:47:36.040]  To be honest with you, I definitely wasn't there to do that, but that's what I would
[3:47:36.040 --> 3:47:37.040]  have said.
[3:47:37.040 --> 3:47:41.600]  I would have put that one more in there, you know, we're not here just to, you know,
[3:47:41.600 --> 3:47:46.560]  you know, fully, you know, exhibit, you know, our rights of open carry, you know, this
[3:47:46.560 --> 3:47:51.800]  is that exercise that we should not, but we're here to defend Obama against, you know, we
[3:47:51.800 --> 3:47:54.280]  listen, listen, I will say this.
[3:47:54.280 --> 3:47:56.920]  I would defend Obama because he's a puppet.
[3:47:56.920 --> 3:48:00.280]  He's an actor for foreign banks just like Bush and everybody else before him back to
[3:48:00.280 --> 3:48:01.440]  Kennedy.
[3:48:01.440 --> 3:48:05.360]  And so if anything ever happens to him, they're going to use it against the second amendment,
[3:48:05.360 --> 3:48:06.440]  but that's a great point.
[3:48:06.440 --> 3:48:10.400]  That's why we are all armed is to keep the peace.
[3:48:10.400 --> 3:48:14.640]  And you have a lot of folks attacking the Tea Party people, and it would have been Chris's
[3:48:14.640 --> 3:48:19.440]  right to defend himself if somebody came after him with a meat cleaver or something.
[3:48:19.440 --> 3:48:20.440]  Exactly.
[3:48:20.440 --> 3:48:21.440]  Of course.
[3:48:21.440 --> 3:48:22.440]  Of course.
[3:48:22.440 --> 3:48:26.160]  I mean, and there's no way that we're going to progress, you know, forward freely unless
[3:48:26.160 --> 3:48:29.640]  we stick to our, our, our codes that we have written for us.
[3:48:29.640 --> 3:48:31.680]  You know, we, those are, they're so important.
[3:48:31.680 --> 3:48:32.680]  We have to do that.
[3:48:32.680 --> 3:48:35.920]  You know, Jake, Jake, I'm going to let you go.
[3:48:35.920 --> 3:48:36.920]  You.
[3:48:36.920 --> 3:48:37.920]  Okay.
[3:48:37.920 --> 3:48:38.920]  Let's go ahead and talk to Richard in Nebraska.
[3:48:38.920 --> 3:48:39.920]  Richard, you're on the air.
[3:48:39.920 --> 3:48:40.920]  Go ahead.
[3:48:40.920 --> 3:48:41.920]  Hello.
[3:48:41.920 --> 3:48:42.920]  Yes, sir.
[3:48:42.920 --> 3:48:50.560]  On last night on the Daily Show at the 7 p.m. of viewing, they made a comment and besides
[3:48:50.560 --> 3:48:56.360]  Keith Overman as well, but I thought it was rather insulting when they commented on about
[3:48:56.360 --> 3:49:03.240]  the healthcare bill and then they said, Oh, and then these, the heat, the way he phrased
[3:49:03.240 --> 3:49:09.160]  it was, uh, these people also showed up with, uh, rifles and everything around there and
[3:49:09.160 --> 3:49:15.200]  we, and then he gives you a strange look in the, and the camera says now what the so-and-so
[3:49:15.200 --> 3:49:20.800]  are these people doing with rifles at this event and everything.
[3:49:20.800 --> 3:49:26.440]  And like, uh, he makes you try and believe it's two different things, but in actuality,
[3:49:26.440 --> 3:49:28.360]  you like that healthcare bill.
[3:49:28.360 --> 3:49:30.320]  Yeah, we've got the report.
[3:49:30.320 --> 3:49:31.320]  We've got the report.
[3:49:31.320 --> 3:49:32.560]  Let's play some of it now.
[3:49:32.560 --> 3:49:35.640]  Here it is.
[3:49:35.640 --> 3:49:39.920]  Southern Poverty Law Center shows that right-wing militias, ideologically driven tax defiers
[3:49:39.920 --> 3:49:44.400]  and so-called sovereign citizens are materializing in significant numbers.
[3:49:44.400 --> 3:49:47.440]  One federal agent noting, you see people buying into what they're saying.
[3:49:47.440 --> 3:49:49.440]  It's primed to grow.
[3:49:49.440 --> 3:49:52.680]  What's priming the movement's growth and alien economy, of course, but one key difference
[3:49:52.680 --> 3:49:57.080]  between militia groups in the 90s and what's fueling actions now, the face of the federal
[3:49:57.080 --> 3:50:01.200]  government, the enemy that almost all parts of the extreme right see as the primary threat
[3:50:01.200 --> 3:50:03.960]  to freedom, is now black.
[3:50:03.960 --> 3:50:07.440]  Another key factor in changing demographic, contributing to the racial animus, have been
[3:50:07.440 --> 3:50:12.440]  fears on the far right about the consequences of Latino immigration, but hate groups are
[3:50:12.440 --> 3:50:13.520]  not the only problem.
[3:50:13.520 --> 3:50:17.280]  Federal authorities are also focusing on those who may be contemplating politically-charged
[3:50:17.280 --> 3:50:19.040]  assaults and acting alone.
[3:50:19.040 --> 3:50:23.600]  The FBI's Lone Wolf Initiative launched to prevent single acts of hate-fueled violence,
[3:50:23.600 --> 3:50:26.880]  like the fatal shooting of three Pittsburgh police officers, or the killing of a black
[3:50:26.880 --> 3:50:29.680]  security guard at the Holocaust Museum in D.C.
[3:50:29.680 --> 3:50:31.480]  All right, stop right there.
[3:50:31.480 --> 3:50:33.120]  This is the guilt by association.
[3:50:33.120 --> 3:50:34.120]  They use this.
[3:50:34.120 --> 3:50:38.600]  Von Brun had been in federal custody, probably a stage deal, to then connect to the Second
[3:50:38.600 --> 3:50:39.600]  Amendment.
[3:50:39.600 --> 3:50:44.320]  During, they just ran in here, CNN is attacking Chris right now.
[3:50:44.320 --> 3:50:45.640]  We've got him here on air.
[3:50:45.640 --> 3:50:48.960]  We're going to go in to overdrive the day with him because this is so important.
[3:50:48.960 --> 3:50:55.040]  We're going to continue with your phone calls, Richard, Jerry, Jenny, and others, infowars.com
[3:50:55.040 --> 3:50:56.040]  is the website.
[3:50:56.040 --> 3:50:58.800]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[3:50:58.800 --> 3:51:02.760]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage
[3:51:02.760 --> 3:51:04.400]  vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[3:51:04.400 --> 3:51:08.440]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver
[3:51:08.440 --> 3:51:09.440]  or gold?
[3:51:09.440 --> 3:51:12.800]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's
[3:51:12.800 --> 3:51:14.960]  possible that could even happen again.
[3:51:14.960 --> 3:51:19.520]  So our friends at Solutions From Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[3:51:19.520 --> 3:51:20.520]  seeds.
[3:51:20.520 --> 3:51:25.440]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense
[3:51:25.440 --> 3:51:27.320]  food for you and your family.
[3:51:27.320 --> 3:51:31.200]  And here's the best part, these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way,
[3:51:31.200 --> 3:51:35.120]  and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full-acre crisis garden.
[3:51:35.120 --> 3:51:38.360]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[3:51:38.360 --> 3:51:45.160]  That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[3:51:45.160 --> 3:51:49.320]  That's 877-327-0365.
[3:51:49.320 --> 3:51:54.160]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[3:51:54.160 --> 3:51:58.120]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[3:51:58.120 --> 3:52:04.240]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:52:04.240 --> 3:52:08.720]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of
[3:52:08.720 --> 3:52:10.040]  us would like to see.
[3:52:10.040 --> 3:52:15.200]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[3:52:15.200 --> 3:52:16.440]  of the American people.
[3:52:16.440 --> 3:52:18.240]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[3:52:18.240 --> 3:52:20.960]  Yeah, fudged since day one in this election.
[3:52:20.960 --> 3:52:26.040]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement, a personality cultist, who is imposing
[3:52:26.040 --> 3:52:34.160]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[3:52:34.160 --> 3:52:35.840]  It's not about left to right.
[3:52:35.840 --> 3:52:37.720]  It's about a one-world government.
[3:52:37.720 --> 3:52:44.640]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[3:52:44.640 --> 3:52:50.120]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com, or download it in Super
[3:52:50.120 --> 3:52:52.840]  High Quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:52:52.840 --> 3:52:54.400]  The Obama deception.
[3:52:54.400 --> 3:52:57.480]  The people strike back.
[3:52:57.480 --> 3:53:02.080]  Did you know that there are tiny hidden radio transmitters, also known as RFID chips, in
[3:53:02.080 --> 3:53:04.680]  millions of passports, credit cards and licenses?
[3:53:04.680 --> 3:53:08.680]  In the current state of the economy, it's no surprise that identity theft has increased.
[3:53:08.680 --> 3:53:12.560]  With current technology, thieves can purchase a simple device online that allows them to
[3:53:12.560 --> 3:53:17.040]  steal your credit card number and other personal information by scanning your wallet or purse.
[3:53:17.040 --> 3:53:19.840]  Think of this identity theft device as a garage door opener.
[3:53:19.840 --> 3:53:22.840]  You push a button and within a certain distance your door opens.
[3:53:22.840 --> 3:53:23.840]  Thieves get near you.
[3:53:23.840 --> 3:53:27.120]  Push a button and these tiny radios give out personal information.
[3:53:27.120 --> 3:53:28.880]  Put a stop to identity theft.
[3:53:28.880 --> 3:53:30.840]  Visit idstronghold.com.
[3:53:30.840 --> 3:53:33.760]  Here you will find radio blocking secure sleeves.
[3:53:33.760 --> 3:53:37.520]  Simply place your credit cards and passports into these slim, lightweight sleeves and
[3:53:37.520 --> 3:53:41.200]  you will put a stop to anyone trying to collect your private information.
[3:53:41.200 --> 3:53:45.240]  For around $5 you will be protected against RFID theft.
[3:53:45.240 --> 3:53:54.160]  Visit idstronghold.com, that's idstronghold.com or call 1-800-610-2770, 1-800-610-2770.
[3:53:54.160 --> 3:54:09.400]  I was sitting in traffic, listening to the radio.
[3:54:09.400 --> 3:54:15.960]  A few times, Chris was distracted, he's getting so many text messages from his friends hearing
[3:54:15.960 --> 3:54:21.440]  him on the show that it's like my phone when a text comes in and he goes doot and then
[3:54:21.440 --> 3:54:24.040]  pops up and kind of distracts you so that's going on.
[3:54:24.040 --> 3:54:27.960]  Kind of like call waiting when somebody calls you and then it like cuts out for two seconds.
[3:54:27.960 --> 3:54:30.160]  That happens a lot with callers when they call in.
[3:54:30.160 --> 3:54:35.400]  We're going to do 10 minutes of overdrive so I can finish up with Chris because this
[3:54:35.400 --> 3:54:36.400]  is so important.
[3:54:36.400 --> 3:54:40.400]  I'll go back and re-broadcast but the overdrive won't be on the AM and FM dial, it will only
[3:54:40.400 --> 3:54:46.720]  be on the streams at infowars.com and on the podcast we send out as well.
[3:54:46.720 --> 3:54:51.600]  Let's jam in three calls that are on the Genesis board before we end the official show.
[3:54:51.600 --> 3:54:58.880]  By the way CNN going to break, the guy saw it on screen, the text tweet questions, aren't
[3:54:58.880 --> 3:55:01.080]  these town hall people terrorist?
[3:55:01.080 --> 3:55:03.160]  Shouldn't they be arrested?
[3:55:03.160 --> 3:55:09.160]  Coming back CNN will discuss it so there's the good news of coming out with our guns
[3:55:09.160 --> 3:55:14.600]  and saying look our guns aren't illegal and breaking that image that guns are illegal
[3:55:14.600 --> 3:55:16.320]  because people think they're already illegal.
[3:55:16.320 --> 3:55:21.280]  We've got to stop that or it's over but then they're also hyping and using it to scare
[3:55:21.280 --> 3:55:22.280]  everybody.
[3:55:22.280 --> 3:55:23.920]  We'll talk about that with Chris in overdrive.
[3:55:23.920 --> 3:55:28.080]  Let's talk to Jerry in Indiana, you're on the air with Chris.
[3:55:28.080 --> 3:55:35.400]  God bless you Alex, I appreciate what you're doing and Chris, thank you for standing up
[3:55:35.400 --> 3:55:39.520]  for liberty in this country.
[3:55:39.520 --> 3:55:46.360]  If I could just throw this out here real quick, here's the hypocrisy of the new world elite.
[3:55:46.360 --> 3:55:54.240]  Bill and Hillary Clinton, I called their office when Clinton came out against a gun
[3:55:54.240 --> 3:56:00.920]  ban in 1993, see they're not really against guns.
[3:56:00.920 --> 3:56:07.720]  These criminals, these builder birds, these elite, they tell half truth.
[3:56:07.720 --> 3:56:14.160]  If they were against guns, they wouldn't have their arm protection 24-7.
[3:56:14.160 --> 3:56:17.440]  Well of course they're against our guns.
[3:56:17.440 --> 3:56:23.200]  Absolutely, they're against poor people owning weapons.
[3:56:23.200 --> 3:56:29.760]  If you're a rich, elitist, builder bird, CFR, trilateralist, hey, they've got enough money
[3:56:29.760 --> 3:56:34.000]  to hire in, you know, what's the group that went there?
[3:56:34.000 --> 3:56:41.680]  Well it came out that Sarah Blackwater, I mean it came out that Sarah Brady owns guns,
[3:56:41.680 --> 3:56:46.520]  has bodyguards, Chucky Schumer does, all these elitists do.
[3:56:46.520 --> 3:56:48.200]  What did Obama say in that closed meeting?
[3:56:48.200 --> 3:56:52.640]  He said these are bitter clingers and all they've got left is their Bible and their
[3:56:52.640 --> 3:56:53.640]  gun.
[3:56:53.640 --> 3:56:56.440]  They've lost their farm, they've lost their house, but they've still got their free
[3:56:56.440 --> 3:57:01.480]  person who at least has a right to defend themselves and they want us to be like Venezuela
[3:57:01.480 --> 3:57:07.920]  or North Korea or someplace or Nicaragua or they can really push us around.
[3:57:07.920 --> 3:57:10.040]  Of course they cynically know that.
[3:57:10.040 --> 3:57:13.640]  Of course they cynically know the word socialist isn't the n-word.
[3:57:13.640 --> 3:57:16.600]  They just cold-bloodedly operate at that level.
[3:57:16.600 --> 3:57:17.920]  Comments on that, Chris?
[3:57:17.920 --> 3:57:25.040]  Well, another group that seems kind of funny that people that want all this national health
[3:57:25.040 --> 3:57:28.720]  care, single-payer health care, it's also the same crowd that doesn't want you to have
[3:57:28.720 --> 3:57:29.720]  a gun.
[3:57:29.720 --> 3:57:33.680]  Like the people that want to steal from you through the government don't want you to
[3:57:33.680 --> 3:57:37.640]  have a weapon to be able to resist it, you know?
[3:57:37.640 --> 3:57:38.640]  Absolutely.
[3:57:38.640 --> 3:57:39.640]  You're absolutely right.
[3:57:39.640 --> 3:57:40.840]  I mean, look at it.
[3:57:40.840 --> 3:57:45.560]  The government can't even read the 1300-page bill that Special Interest wrote, but the
[3:57:45.560 --> 3:57:47.800]  government's going to be able to run our health care.
[3:57:47.800 --> 3:57:51.360]  And then they lie and say that government control isn't in the bill.
[3:57:51.360 --> 3:57:55.000]  I mean, you know, the government's lost all credibility because they've been caught lying
[3:57:55.000 --> 3:57:56.000]  so much.
[3:57:56.000 --> 3:57:57.000]  Thank you, Jerry.
[3:57:57.000 --> 3:58:03.520]  I'm going to give the number out for Jenny and Tessa and a few other callers for Chris
[3:58:03.520 --> 3:58:04.520]  in Overdrive.
[3:58:04.520 --> 3:58:10.360]  It's 888-201-2244-888-2012-244.
[3:58:10.360 --> 3:58:12.200]  We're going to go to break here in a moment, Chris.
[3:58:12.200 --> 3:58:16.600]  Come back 10, 15 minutes with you in Overdrive and we'll go into rebroadcast.
[3:58:16.600 --> 3:58:22.440]  This will be internet only at prismplanet.tv for the video subscribers and for all the
[3:58:22.440 --> 3:58:26.400]  free streams at infowars.com and the podcast.
[3:58:26.400 --> 3:58:27.400]  Great job, crew.
[3:58:27.400 --> 3:58:33.560]  We'll be back tomorrow at live 11am to 3pm, but we're going to continue right now in
[3:58:33.560 --> 3:58:34.560]  Overdrive.
[3:58:34.560 --> 3:58:35.560]  Stay with us.
[3:58:35.560 --> 3:58:40.720]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[3:58:40.720 --> 3:58:47.720]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[3:59:10.720 --> 3:59:29.840]  I'm Alex Jones.
[3:59:29.840 --> 3:59:33.080]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[3:59:33.080 --> 3:59:40.480]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[3:59:40.480 --> 3:59:46.200]  Again that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[3:59:46.200 --> 3:59:50.000]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[3:59:50.000 --> 4:00:14.000]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[4:00:14.000 --> 4:00:15.000]  All right.
[4:00:15.000 --> 4:00:16.000]  We are in Overdrive.
[4:00:16.000 --> 4:00:18.640]  Do this maybe once a month or so.
[4:00:18.640 --> 4:00:20.160]  We have Chris.
[4:00:20.160 --> 4:00:24.880]  If you just joined us, Chris is the gentleman that you've seen all over national television,
[4:00:24.880 --> 4:00:31.680]  the white shirt, black tie, he's a black man, he's got the AR-15 strap to his back outside
[4:00:31.680 --> 4:00:38.760]  an event where Obama was speaking with a dozen or so other people with firearms openly.
[4:00:38.760 --> 4:00:42.480]  Now they can legally have them concealed, but see under common law it's illegal to
[4:00:42.480 --> 4:00:47.560]  conceal weapons so they can give you a permit for concealed because that is illegal, hiding
[4:00:47.560 --> 4:00:49.520]  a weapon.
[4:00:49.520 --> 4:00:51.520]  So a permit is a right to do something.
[4:00:51.520 --> 4:00:54.520]  A license is a right to do something that's illegal.
[4:00:54.520 --> 4:00:58.880]  Open carry, you don't need a license except in a very few states that have unconstitutionally
[4:00:58.880 --> 4:01:03.560]  and a few cities that have unconstitutionally overthrown that because if they start overthrowing
[4:01:03.560 --> 4:01:05.680]  the Second Amendment, all of it goes.
[4:01:05.680 --> 4:01:08.240]  That's why a lot of states haven't done that.
[4:01:08.240 --> 4:01:15.080]  It's just they create the illusion, the perception that guns are already illegal across the board.
[4:01:15.080 --> 4:01:16.480]  So going back to Chris.
[4:01:16.480 --> 4:01:21.280]  Tell us before we go to a few calls here, what is it like to see CNN, all these other
[4:01:21.280 --> 4:01:26.640]  channels demonizing you, attacking you on, I want to finish up with this Obermann clip
[4:01:26.640 --> 4:01:27.640]  as well.
[4:01:27.640 --> 4:01:29.640]  I mean, what is it like to see this happening?
[4:01:29.640 --> 4:01:32.320]  That's just business as usual for them.
[4:01:32.320 --> 4:01:37.360]  I don't watch TV, I don't listen to the radio, I don't really expose myself to any mainstream
[4:01:37.360 --> 4:01:41.360]  media sources because I've seen this forever, I've seen this my whole life.
[4:01:41.360 --> 4:01:45.280]  I mean, if you turn on the TV and you don't see that they're just trying to propagandize
[4:01:45.280 --> 4:01:51.600]  you and condition you and tell you what your opinion should be, I mean, you're a fool.
[4:01:51.600 --> 4:01:53.920]  I could care less what they're saying about me.
[4:01:53.920 --> 4:01:54.920]  What do you listen to?
[4:01:54.920 --> 4:01:58.000]  You say you were familiar with this show, you reached out to us.
[4:01:58.000 --> 4:02:01.520]  I mean, how long have you been listening to this show or have you seen my films?
[4:02:01.520 --> 4:02:03.480]  How are you familiar with us?
[4:02:03.480 --> 4:02:09.040]  I've seen a bunch of your films and I have like, I listen to the show on my telephone
[4:02:09.040 --> 4:02:16.520]  every once in a while, if I'm out somewhere and just to kill some time, I'll listen to
[4:02:16.520 --> 4:02:20.480]  the show through my cell phone with the number you can call.
[4:02:20.480 --> 4:02:25.880]  But mainly, I listen to just independent, I look at independent news sources, IPS news
[4:02:25.880 --> 4:02:27.440]  is a good news source.
[4:02:27.440 --> 4:02:35.320]  I read a lot of blogs, I read bluerockwell.com, I read freedomphoenix.com, that's the kind
[4:02:35.320 --> 4:02:36.320]  of stuff I look at.
[4:02:36.320 --> 4:02:43.640]  There's a good YouTube channel, it's Ron Paul, it's RP4409, the guy that puts that on it,
[4:02:43.640 --> 4:02:45.120]  he makes some good videos.
[4:02:45.120 --> 4:02:47.680]  So you're a fan of Ron Paul?
[4:02:47.680 --> 4:02:52.400]  Oh, big time fan of Ron Paul, I think he's the only, as far as I can think of off the
[4:02:52.400 --> 4:02:56.800]  top of my head right now, he's the only honest politician we've ever had, the only one that
[4:02:56.800 --> 4:03:01.480]  cares anything about obeying his oath to the Constitution and as far as I know, he has
[4:03:01.480 --> 4:03:04.680]  a perfect voting record, constitutional voting record.
[4:03:04.680 --> 4:03:10.160]  Well, exactly, I mean, at Dennis Kucinich, you can like him because he's real and because
[4:03:10.160 --> 4:03:13.840]  he actually does what he says he'll do and he does, he makes some good stands, but then
[4:03:13.840 --> 4:03:20.480]  he wants our guns and he's a true believer, but he's really dangerous in that respect.
[4:03:20.480 --> 4:03:24.280]  And then you've got a Cynthia McKinney who will expose government-wide slavery rings
[4:03:24.280 --> 4:03:28.760]  and corruption and some of the bad things Israel's doing with the Zionism and things,
[4:03:28.760 --> 4:03:31.720]  but then she won't, she also wants our guns.
[4:03:31.720 --> 4:03:36.320]  Now I like Cindy Sheehan, she finally gets it and says, yeah, we have a tyrannical government,
[4:03:36.320 --> 4:03:38.120]  we shouldn't have any gun control.
[4:03:38.120 --> 4:03:44.680]  Somebody like Cindy Sheehan's a real person, you know, she's come a long way in her process,
[4:03:44.680 --> 4:03:48.840]  but I don't understand how anybody wouldn't understand, fundamentally, we need to all
[4:03:48.840 --> 4:03:49.840]  be armed.
[4:03:49.840 --> 4:03:50.840]  Absolutely.
[4:03:50.840 --> 4:03:56.520]  Well, if you're a good honest person, wouldn't you want to be armed?
[4:03:56.520 --> 4:04:00.000]  I mean, the bad guys have guns, if you're a good honest person and you know you'd never
[4:04:00.000 --> 4:04:06.280]  harm anybody that wasn't trying to harm you, why not test the odds in our favor and go
[4:04:06.280 --> 4:04:14.280]  out and learn some gun safety and get yourself some guns and you know, why not?
[4:04:14.280 --> 4:04:19.160]  Chris, what would you like to say to CNN and others that are posting these questions for
[4:04:19.160 --> 4:04:25.120]  the audience of, you know, is Chris and these people basically, are they terrorists, they're
[4:04:25.120 --> 4:04:29.800]  coming out and saying, and then by extension, oh, look, they've got guns, are they terrorists
[4:04:29.800 --> 4:04:38.400]  and then they expand that to, oh my gosh, you know, these evil people, should they be arrested,
[4:04:38.400 --> 4:04:43.080]  should the Tea Party people, should the Town Hall people be arrested, they're now openly
[4:04:43.080 --> 4:04:48.040]  saying this, the Southern Prairie Law Center is now openly coming out and saying we're
[4:04:48.040 --> 4:04:51.360]  going to be violent, saying we're the terrorists.
[4:04:51.360 --> 4:04:52.920]  What would you like to say to CNN?
[4:04:52.920 --> 4:05:00.440]  Well, I guess I would say that in my opinion, the term terrorist today is used to, is applied
[4:05:00.440 --> 4:05:06.640]  to people that are just resisting occupation, resisting oppression, so I mean, that's what
[4:05:06.640 --> 4:05:10.040]  I'm doing, so if that's what I am, that's what I am, but I mean, I have no intention
[4:05:10.040 --> 4:05:15.880]  to harm anybody that's not attacking me, you know, my weapons are for defense, they're
[4:05:15.880 --> 4:05:19.120]  not for defending myself from criminals, because you know, and honestly, I haven't really been
[4:05:19.120 --> 4:05:23.280]  a victim of much crime in my life, I've been a victim of government crime, crime from the
[4:05:23.280 --> 4:05:27.560]  state, but that's what my guns are for, is to pretend that's what the Second Amendment
[4:05:27.560 --> 4:05:30.800]  was written for, it was written to protect people from the government, so that when they
[4:05:30.800 --> 4:05:35.960]  get out of control, we can, you know, do what we have to do, just give them, you know, any
[4:05:35.960 --> 4:05:40.720]  means necessary to stop them from controlling us.
[4:05:40.720 --> 4:05:44.480]  Any means necessary, that's the Malcolm X quote, so you believe in that?
[4:05:44.480 --> 4:05:48.680]  I absolutely believe in that, absolutely, Pete, you're only as free as you're willing,
[4:05:48.680 --> 4:05:51.920]  I say this to people, and it sounds kind of extreme, but you're only as free as you're
[4:05:51.920 --> 4:05:56.400]  willing to, you know, pull a trigger, that's free as you are, but when you pick the line
[4:05:56.400 --> 4:06:00.880]  or you're willing to pull a trigger, that's how free you are.
[4:06:00.880 --> 4:06:04.280]  Well it is the willingness, that's what our founders did, and that's why FEMA, have you
[4:06:04.280 --> 4:06:08.520]  ever seen the footage we got from a fireman, a FEMA in Kansas City teaching police and
[4:06:08.520 --> 4:06:11.920]  firemen that the founders were bad, and that America's bad?
[4:06:11.920 --> 4:06:16.960]  No, I haven't seen that, you mean you find so much stuff, it's like, you know, getting
[4:06:16.960 --> 4:06:20.680]  into all of it would be like a full-time job, man, you're exposing so much stuff.
[4:06:20.680 --> 4:06:25.920]  Well no, I'm just, I mean, I'm backing up what you're saying, you've seen the DHS report
[4:06:25.920 --> 4:06:30.760]  we broke in the MYAC report, where they say gun owners period and returning vets are what
[4:06:30.760 --> 4:06:35.880]  Homeland Security's main mission is, I mean, we knew day one this was set up for the American
[4:06:35.880 --> 4:06:40.080]  people, now they just admit it, I say they're the terrorist.
[4:06:40.080 --> 4:06:43.760]  Yeah, they're just trying, they're trying to, in fact, I don't know if this is even
[4:06:43.760 --> 4:06:47.000]  true, but I've read some definition on the term terrorist that it was originally meant
[4:06:47.000 --> 4:06:51.120]  to apply to governments attacking their own people.
[4:06:51.120 --> 4:06:52.120]  Yes.
[4:06:52.120 --> 4:06:56.720]  I mean, I haven't done much more research, I gotta look into it more, but I mean, what
[4:06:56.720 --> 4:06:57.720]  else is there to say?
[4:06:57.720 --> 4:07:04.400]  If that's really what the true definition of it is, then, I don't know.
[4:07:04.400 --> 4:07:09.600]  Well you know, it's really a travesty that so many people don't understand the basics
[4:07:09.600 --> 4:07:15.840]  of liberty, but at the same time, are you bullied, I mean, are you excited?
[4:07:15.840 --> 4:07:19.400]  Are you seeing a huge awakening taking place?
[4:07:19.400 --> 4:07:25.040]  Oh, I'm actually, I don't know, there's like a lot of different shillings.
[4:07:25.040 --> 4:07:31.560]  One thing I'm definitely disappointed in is the majority of the Second Amendment movement.
[4:07:31.560 --> 4:07:37.880]  You know, for a long time I thought the pro-gun crowd was the crowd that kind of got it a
[4:07:37.880 --> 4:07:43.360]  little bit, and I'm coming to the realization that most people in the Second Amendment movement,
[4:07:43.360 --> 4:07:47.120]  they're not really for gun rights, they're not really for defense, they don't really
[4:07:47.120 --> 4:07:51.040]  understand what the real purpose of the Second Amendment was, they're just gun enthusiasts.
[4:07:51.040 --> 4:07:55.320]  They're like people that collect beanie babies, they collect guns instead, and they can care
[4:07:55.320 --> 4:07:59.880]  less, you know, they want a government that's gonna allow them to have guns, but if the
[4:07:59.880 --> 4:08:02.640]  government ever says no, they're not gonna do anything, they're just gonna hand them
[4:08:02.640 --> 4:08:07.400]  right over, and they're basically worthless, they contribute nothing, they're just in
[4:08:07.400 --> 4:08:08.400]  the way.
[4:08:08.400 --> 4:08:14.360]  If you want to be a part of a real Second Amendment, you know, a real, you know, a group
[4:08:14.360 --> 4:08:17.880]  that stands up for your right to protect yourself of firearms, there's groups like gun owners
[4:08:17.880 --> 4:08:23.840]  of America, AZCDL, JPFO, these are like the real gun groups.
[4:08:23.840 --> 4:08:28.600]  The NRA, you know, has done a lot because they're so big, but they're not really, that's
[4:08:28.600 --> 4:08:32.600]  like the beginner, that's like, if you're into guns and you're kind of a beginner in
[4:08:32.600 --> 4:08:35.080]  the Second Amendment movement, that's where the beginners go.
[4:08:35.080 --> 4:08:37.960]  And when you want to elevate things, you go to the other groups.
[4:08:37.960 --> 4:08:39.480]  Well it's worse than that.
[4:08:39.480 --> 4:08:44.520]  I finally got gun owners of America to come out with the history and the documents that
[4:08:44.520 --> 4:08:50.240]  they had and we had because the NRA was founded by the federal government.
[4:08:50.240 --> 4:08:55.240]  The NRA actually supported the 68 Gun Control Act, the basis of the nightmare we live under
[4:08:55.240 --> 4:09:00.760]  today that they've expanded the NICs and all the rest of this, this registration.
[4:09:00.760 --> 4:09:02.960]  So they're actually a Judas Go.
[4:09:02.960 --> 4:09:06.120]  How do you get 150 million gun owners to give up their rights?
[4:09:06.120 --> 4:09:10.960]  You have a group that claims they represent you, that leads you to the slaughter.
[4:09:10.960 --> 4:09:11.960]  Exactly.
[4:09:11.960 --> 4:09:12.960]  Exactly.
[4:09:12.960 --> 4:09:16.280]  And those are the same people that are coming out against me.
[4:09:16.280 --> 4:09:17.840]  I've been a lifelong NRA member.
[4:09:17.840 --> 4:09:20.960]  I don't need to hear anything else you have to say because I know what your position is.
[4:09:20.960 --> 4:09:21.960]  You're an enthusiast.
[4:09:21.960 --> 4:09:25.920]  You're not an activist.
[4:09:25.920 --> 4:09:27.320]  Well they do like a nanny around.
[4:09:27.320 --> 4:09:35.520]  I remember they had a bill in 1998, the Texas legislature was in the Dallas Morning News
[4:09:35.520 --> 4:09:40.120]  and we were fighting again in 2000, next time it was in session.
[4:09:40.120 --> 4:09:44.720]  And the bill would ban junior shooting sports in Texas, shut down private transfer.
[4:09:44.720 --> 4:09:48.520]  They call it gun show loophole, but it wouldn't let me shell a gun to my neighbor or buy a
[4:09:48.520 --> 4:09:51.040]  gun for my dad or anything.
[4:09:51.040 --> 4:09:58.240]  And we'd create all this many times worse than the 68 gun control act and the NRA wasn't
[4:09:58.240 --> 4:10:02.320]  sending lobbyists and I was down there with the hundreds of people.
[4:10:02.320 --> 4:10:04.240]  There'd be 300 of us to speak against it.
[4:10:04.240 --> 4:10:07.880]  They'd have four paid guys playing the race card.
[4:10:07.880 --> 4:10:11.880]  They got gang banging type black guys to come up and go, we're dangerous.
[4:10:11.880 --> 4:10:12.880]  We're gang members.
[4:10:12.880 --> 4:10:15.320]  We can buy guns cheap and do stuff.
[4:10:15.320 --> 4:10:18.040]  And then the liberals brought them out and paid them off in the hall.
[4:10:18.040 --> 4:10:19.240]  I went and got video of it.
[4:10:19.240 --> 4:10:23.320]  They were using the black guys as like a race car, Oh, look, scary black people.
[4:10:23.320 --> 4:10:24.320]  They've got guns.
[4:10:24.320 --> 4:10:25.320]  You want to ban them?
[4:10:25.320 --> 4:10:27.160]  Wouldn't let our 300 people speak.
[4:10:27.160 --> 4:10:32.720]  But luckily I caught the bribery and then the, the NRA attacked us in the Dallas Morning
[4:10:32.720 --> 4:10:37.920]  News and said we were extreme, that they were neutral on the gun bills.
[4:10:37.920 --> 4:10:41.760]  So see they are actually a vicious anti-gun group.
[4:10:41.760 --> 4:10:46.080]  See they'll, they'll put out rhetoric there for it, Chris, but then when it comes time
[4:10:46.080 --> 4:10:51.360]  to actually do something, that's when you find out their agents, I wouldn't be surprised
[4:10:51.360 --> 4:10:52.360]  at all.
[4:10:52.360 --> 4:10:54.760]  All I know is all their members, all their members are opposed to what I did and all
[4:10:54.760 --> 4:10:59.600]  the real gun groups are at, are, you know, applauding me, baby CDL, you know, wants to
[4:10:59.600 --> 4:11:01.120]  give me an honorary life membership.
[4:11:01.120 --> 4:11:04.360]  I mean, these are, these are the real pro gun groups, but no compromise.
[4:11:04.360 --> 4:11:10.440]  If the NRA was doing its job and really educating all of its members, the gun debate wouldn't
[4:11:10.440 --> 4:11:11.440]  even be an issue.
[4:11:11.440 --> 4:11:13.880]  It wouldn't even be, there would be no gun debate in this country.
[4:11:13.880 --> 4:11:19.120]  Except we got 150 plus million gun owners, 400 million guns.
[4:11:19.120 --> 4:11:20.360]  We rule this country.
[4:11:20.360 --> 4:11:21.360]  It's ours.
[4:11:21.360 --> 4:11:22.360]  Exactly.
[4:11:22.360 --> 4:11:23.360]  Exactly.
[4:11:23.360 --> 4:11:28.400]  If it wasn't for these weak, you know, like these people that are sugarcoating everything
[4:11:28.400 --> 4:11:31.760]  and giving, you know, giving this, send this weak little message, no compromise.
[4:11:31.760 --> 4:11:34.840]  We can't, we can't compromise at all on this.
[4:11:34.840 --> 4:11:36.640]  Let's take a call from Jenny in Idaho.
[4:11:36.640 --> 4:11:40.160]  You're on the air with Chris, a modern American hero for the second amendment.
[4:11:40.160 --> 4:11:41.160]  Go ahead.
[4:11:41.160 --> 4:11:44.160]  Chris, you're my hero.
[4:11:44.160 --> 4:11:45.160]  Wow.
[4:11:45.160 --> 4:11:46.640]  Thanks to you.
[4:11:46.640 --> 4:11:49.240]  I am wearing my gun now out in public.
[4:11:49.240 --> 4:11:52.640]  I'm in an open carry state.
[4:11:52.640 --> 4:11:58.400]  And Alex, I want to know when do I get my Chris t-shirt that says protect your second
[4:11:58.400 --> 4:11:59.400]  amendment?
[4:11:59.400 --> 4:12:00.400]  Show me your gun.
[4:12:00.400 --> 4:12:01.400]  Well, there's so many great t-shirt ideas.
[4:12:01.400 --> 4:12:02.400]  I don't want to be on the t-shirt.
[4:12:02.400 --> 4:12:03.400]  I don't want to be on the t-shirt.
[4:12:03.400 --> 4:12:04.400]  No.
[4:12:04.400 --> 4:12:05.400]  You don't want to be on the t-shirt, Chris?
[4:12:05.400 --> 4:12:06.400]  No, I don't want to be on t-shirt.
[4:12:06.400 --> 4:12:12.160]  No, I don't want to be on t-shirt.
[4:12:12.160 --> 4:12:15.080]  Seeing ends already using you for their anti gun agenda.
[4:12:15.080 --> 4:12:21.440]  So you, you know, you might want to go on seeing in or Fox, Jenny, hold on one second.
[4:12:21.440 --> 4:12:23.140]  We'll go back to you.
[4:12:23.140 --> 4:12:28.440]  You might want to go on these channels just with talking points and just stick to those
[4:12:28.440 --> 4:12:34.480]  but only agree to do it live so they can't edit you because right now they're, they're
[4:12:34.480 --> 4:12:38.720]  only going one way with it, but I guess at the end of the day, you're getting your info
[4:12:38.720 --> 4:12:39.720]  out so it doesn't matter.
[4:12:39.720 --> 4:12:40.720]  But Jenny, go ahead.
[4:12:40.720 --> 4:12:49.200]  I'd like to challenge everybody in an open carry state to start wearing their guns.
[4:12:49.200 --> 4:12:53.800]  I'd like to challenge everybody, it's not in an open carry state to go, go, go wear your
[4:12:53.800 --> 4:12:54.800]  guns.
[4:12:54.800 --> 4:12:57.800]  And if you have to group together to do it and do it in large numbers, then do it that
[4:12:57.800 --> 4:12:58.800]  way.
[4:12:58.800 --> 4:13:03.040]  But well, people should be, the reason I say it takes a lot of courage and he's a hero
[4:13:03.040 --> 4:13:07.960]  and other foot, the fella in New Hampshire is too is because the government will try
[4:13:07.960 --> 4:13:12.280]  to provocateur, especially if they know it's a predestined event.
[4:13:12.280 --> 4:13:17.680]  And I would look for them to try something, but we can't not go out and engage them and
[4:13:17.680 --> 4:13:20.320]  demand our rights by, by exercising them.
[4:13:20.320 --> 4:13:21.320]  Rights are not given.
[4:13:21.320 --> 4:13:22.320]  They're taken.
[4:13:22.320 --> 4:13:23.320]  They're taking them from us.
[4:13:23.320 --> 4:13:25.120]  We got to take them back.
[4:13:25.120 --> 4:13:27.280]  And so in fact, pull up the Frederick Douglass quote.
[4:13:27.280 --> 4:13:30.720]  I want the exact quote about Frederick Douglass rights are taken, not given.
[4:13:30.720 --> 4:13:32.720]  I want to get the exact quote up on screen.
[4:13:32.720 --> 4:13:39.560]  These guys, Frederick Douglass, but look, they're going to do what they're going to do.
[4:13:39.560 --> 4:13:43.480]  We're going to have to do what we're going to do that what we can't just sit here and
[4:13:43.480 --> 4:13:47.240]  let the world go past us as spectators.
[4:13:47.240 --> 4:13:50.240]  And so I commend what he's doing.
[4:13:50.240 --> 4:13:54.960]  I would say though, I've seen cases one in Colorado that's an open carry.
[4:13:54.960 --> 4:13:56.440]  This guy went to a rally with one.
[4:13:56.440 --> 4:14:00.280]  They went ahead and arrested him, set him up, send him to prison, even though there wasn't
[4:14:00.280 --> 4:14:01.280]  a law.
[4:14:01.280 --> 4:14:06.320]  Kelly rushing in Lyon County, Kentucky was in the newspaper and this is one of many
[4:14:06.320 --> 4:14:11.200]  cases he gave a state police officer a video with Ron Paul on it and then one of my films
[4:14:11.200 --> 4:14:12.200]  after it.
[4:14:12.200 --> 4:14:18.000]  They indicted him for the Ron Paul video that was listed in the court and my film rode
[4:14:18.000 --> 4:14:19.360]  the tyranny.
[4:14:19.360 --> 4:14:24.840]  And they said the officers felt threatened by the content was anti law enforcement.
[4:14:24.840 --> 4:14:29.760]  So I called the judge up at home and I said, because it was his number and information
[4:14:29.760 --> 4:14:35.000]  and I said, well, I'm not getting in your trial, but is this newspaper article accurate
[4:14:35.000 --> 4:14:41.720]  that you are presiding over a trial over somebody giving somebody an Alex Jones, Ron Paul video?
[4:14:41.720 --> 4:14:43.840]  And he said, yes, that trial is coming up next week.
[4:14:43.840 --> 4:14:45.560]  I'm not going to talk to you about it.
[4:14:45.560 --> 4:14:46.920]  And I said, you got to be kidding me.
[4:14:46.920 --> 4:14:51.080]  And I said, okay, I just, I just, I just couldn't believe this news article.
[4:14:51.080 --> 4:14:52.080]  I was faxed.
[4:14:52.080 --> 4:14:59.260]  And then I talked to Kelly rushing of standing a member of the community, no criminal record.
[4:14:59.260 --> 4:15:03.560]  And when the cops came and arrested him, they laughed at him when he was in the car and
[4:15:03.560 --> 4:15:05.480]  said, you're going to prison for giving me that video.
[4:15:05.480 --> 4:15:07.440]  I mean, they're crazy.
[4:15:07.440 --> 4:15:10.240]  So do we stop giving video tapes out?
[4:15:10.240 --> 4:15:12.480]  That was like seven, no, it was like six years ago.
[4:15:12.480 --> 4:15:13.880]  So it was a VHS tape.
[4:15:13.880 --> 4:15:19.040]  I mean, do we stop giving videos out because the, because the police say they're illegal?
[4:15:19.040 --> 4:15:23.480]  I mean, do we stop putting the signs up on street corners because they say it's illegal?
[4:15:23.480 --> 4:15:26.000]  Do we just bend over completely to them?
[4:15:26.000 --> 4:15:27.960]  I mean, that's the big question.
[4:15:27.960 --> 4:15:29.320]  Good to hear from you, Jenny.
[4:15:29.320 --> 4:15:30.760]  I appreciate your call.
[4:15:30.760 --> 4:15:35.840]  Closing comments along those lines, Chris, uh, no, I do have one closing comment.
[4:15:35.840 --> 4:15:40.200]  I'd like to say I just like to, uh, thank the police department for handling everything
[4:15:40.200 --> 4:15:42.320]  in the most professional way they possibly could.
[4:15:42.320 --> 4:15:45.480]  I think they're the most professional police department in the country.
[4:15:45.480 --> 4:15:48.800]  Now I did notice they did have some armed officers around you.
[4:15:48.800 --> 4:15:52.040]  Were they federal marshals or were they, or were they Phoenix?
[4:15:52.040 --> 4:15:55.600]  I think they were just like Phoenix detectives or something, but they, they were, they were
[4:15:55.600 --> 4:15:59.880]  awesome. We were, we, we, we had some discussions and chitchat a little bit and they handled
[4:15:59.880 --> 4:16:03.200]  it. They, they said, we're here to make sure no one jumps on you. We're not at all concerned
[4:16:03.200 --> 4:16:08.200]  about what you're doing and they did their body language because I've watched the tapes
[4:16:08.200 --> 4:16:13.080]  was friendly and they seemed excited and they were, they were, they were looking at you
[4:16:13.080 --> 4:16:18.880]  approvingly. Uh, so sounds like there's some, actually some good people, uh, specifically
[4:16:18.880 --> 4:16:20.880]  tell me about your chitchat.
[4:16:20.880 --> 4:16:26.440]  Uh, I, I had a lot of them were coming up to me and telling me, everyone's asking me,
[4:16:26.440 --> 4:16:31.600]  if you can do this, can you do this? Can you do this? And, and you know, there's, uh,
[4:16:31.600 --> 4:16:34.560]  one of them, one of them said, and he said, he said, don't tell him I said this, but I
[4:16:34.560 --> 4:16:39.600]  think what you're doing is awesome. And he said, I'm all for it. And it was nothing
[4:16:39.600 --> 4:16:43.360]  but positive things from the Phoenix police department. They were outstanding. They said,
[4:16:43.360 --> 4:16:49.320]  we would rather be out here. You know, our job is to, our job is to make peace, is to
[4:16:49.320 --> 4:16:53.080]  keep the peace. That's all we're here for. And you have every right to be here exercising
[4:16:53.080 --> 4:16:57.400]  your views and the opposite, the other side, all the, all these people have the right to
[4:16:57.400 --> 4:17:01.840]  express their views. And our, our job here is only to keep the peace. And I was just
[4:17:01.840 --> 4:17:06.480]  blown away. I was, you know, cause I come from, I come from Cleveland, Ohio and Cleveland,
[4:17:06.480 --> 4:17:11.040]  Ohio, their job is not to keep the peace. You know, they, they do whatever the heck they
[4:17:11.040 --> 4:17:15.080]  want. And I was, I'm just very proud of Phoenix police department.
[4:17:15.080 --> 4:17:20.080]  Well, yeah. I mean, I saw that in the video, the police officers, the body language was
[4:17:20.080 --> 4:17:26.920]  no nine, nine tenths of communication is nonverbal was we love this guy. This is great. But if
[4:17:26.920 --> 4:17:32.320]  you to come out there with a mask and we'll dress like a clown and camo, I mean, camo
[4:17:32.320 --> 4:17:38.560]  is for Southeast Asia. These people do it. And then it just looks clownish. I'm going
[4:17:38.560 --> 4:17:43.040]  to tell militias this, if you're going to wear camouflage at a public event, you better
[4:17:43.040 --> 4:17:49.080]  be in bad ass shape and you better have that uniform looking exactly right. And you better,
[4:17:49.080 --> 4:17:53.240]  you know, because, because if it doesn't, you look like clowns. It's like Republic
[4:17:53.240 --> 4:17:58.700]  of Texas. I support investigating that, looking at that, talking about that, Texans making
[4:17:58.700 --> 4:18:04.480]  their own decision. But I mean, hillbillies going, I'm the president. No, I'm the president.
[4:18:04.480 --> 4:18:09.320]  You know, a hundred different hillbilly groups going and like their wives going, Mr. President,
[4:18:09.320 --> 4:18:13.360]  the admiral's here and they pulled up with a bass boat. And I'm not even joking. You
[4:18:13.360 --> 4:18:18.560]  know, that, that discredits everyone, but you out there clean cut, well spoken with
[4:18:18.560 --> 4:18:22.960]  it strapped your back. That's a good image. I predict they're going to send people out
[4:18:22.960 --> 4:18:27.880]  mask. They're going to send provocateurs out. They're really scared of this, but we keep
[4:18:27.880 --> 4:18:32.440]  catching them Denver cops. We caught provocaturing. We caught the Ottawa police. They caught the
[4:18:32.440 --> 4:18:36.680]  British doing it. So they're kind of scared of provocaturing because they know we're looking
[4:18:36.680 --> 4:18:41.600]  for it. See now we're in the game. Now we know the game. It's not like our first season
[4:18:41.600 --> 4:18:46.080]  of football. We've gone through Pee Wee League and now we're, you know, into the junior high
[4:18:46.080 --> 4:18:50.640]  stuff and we're about to go into varsity. And then we're going to go into the college
[4:18:50.640 --> 4:18:56.760]  and pro level and the global has been playing the pro level for a long time. We are quickly
[4:18:56.760 --> 4:19:02.440]  coming up in the next few years on every level. No matter what they do, all their little
[4:19:02.440 --> 4:19:06.880]  tricks and programs are now being exposed. You see what I'm saying, Chris? Oh yeah. Yeah.
[4:19:06.880 --> 4:19:13.040]  I also think that, uh, armed citizens at these events, you know, kind of discourage
[4:19:13.040 --> 4:19:17.400]  provocateurs from causing trouble because now it's not just, you know, they can run
[4:19:17.400 --> 4:19:20.720]  into a crowd and make people and there's nothing they can do or they can throw rocks
[4:19:20.720 --> 4:19:24.880]  and throw bottles. Well, now there's armed people, armed good people in the crowd that
[4:19:24.880 --> 4:19:32.360]  can fight back or, you know, dangerous to a provocateur. Now I've said again, I'm sorry,
[4:19:32.360 --> 4:19:36.840]  it's dangerous for a provocateur with armed with armed people in the crowd. It's dangerous
[4:19:36.840 --> 4:19:43.320]  for a provocateur. Well, this is the spirit of 1776 rising again, Chris, and we commend
[4:19:43.320 --> 4:19:48.440]  your courage. Uh, and I think it's an important message to the establishment and to the minions
[4:19:48.440 --> 4:19:53.840]  and to the communist parasite rabble. We're done playing games and they wanted to have
[4:19:53.840 --> 4:19:59.960]  Obama's youth brigades with him, 16s training the youth for this to be used against us.
[4:19:59.960 --> 4:20:05.640]  And I think it fundamentally freaks them out to see you guys out there with this much
[4:20:05.640 --> 4:20:10.560]  courage, but I think real men and women resonate with the courage and knew what it took for
[4:20:10.560 --> 4:20:14.880]  you to come out there and do it. Plus the police are like, there's already concealed
[4:20:14.880 --> 4:20:21.280]  weapons all over the place out there. They know how stupid it is. Go ahead. Sorry. I
[4:20:21.280 --> 4:20:24.320]  just said there could have been thousands of guns concealed out there. We have no idea.
[4:20:24.320 --> 4:20:27.920]  But I mean, that's my point. You're in the middle of downtown Phoenix. There were thousands
[4:20:27.920 --> 4:20:32.160]  of guns. That's one of the most popular concealed carry states. I've seen the numbers. In fact,
[4:20:32.160 --> 4:20:36.240]  it's one of the top stage for people carrying firearms concealed. I know I've seen that.
[4:20:36.240 --> 4:20:42.520]  So, uh, you know, that's the issue I'm trying to make here is the police live in a gun world.
[4:20:42.520 --> 4:20:47.520]  So they know there's already guns everywhere. They would rather see the rifle, the handgun
[4:20:47.520 --> 4:20:52.000]  out in the open because that means you're in defense. That means I'm out in the open.
[4:20:52.000 --> 4:20:57.880]  I'm armed. I'm here to keep the pieces of citizen as a militiamen. You don't go running
[4:20:57.880 --> 4:21:05.080]  around in the woods and worship some commander, you know, who tells you, you know, how great
[4:21:05.080 --> 4:21:09.600]  Hitler is. He's probably a federal officer. That's not being in the militia. Being in
[4:21:09.600 --> 4:21:16.080]  the militia is doing what you did out there openly. And so again, this is a shift, a paradigm
[4:21:16.080 --> 4:21:21.120]  shift that's happening to where I didn't even recognize the paradigm shift. I know about
[4:21:21.120 --> 4:21:26.600]  concealed carry, but I mean about open carry. But when, when I've talked about how important
[4:21:26.600 --> 4:21:32.000]  it is, but when I got reports, guy with an earpiece out there with a gun, I immediately
[4:21:32.000 --> 4:21:37.640]  thought provocateur because I didn't even gauge the amount of courage to go to a presidential
[4:21:37.640 --> 4:21:44.040]  event and do it. The boldness of it, I wasn't even ready to deal with. And they're still,
[4:21:44.040 --> 4:21:48.700]  we still need to look out for groups and people. And I mean, there are a lot of covert agendas
[4:21:48.700 --> 4:21:54.680]  going on and it's all very complex and the enemy's very, very treacherous. Uh, but, uh,
[4:21:54.680 --> 4:22:00.600]  this is just so exciting. Uh, what's happening. And again, a free man would have his sword
[4:22:00.600 --> 4:22:07.040]  or his rifle openly on him. It's the criminals, the murderers. What police even 50 years ago,
[4:22:07.040 --> 4:22:12.040]  a hundred years ago, we're looking for was somebody with a hidden weapon. The bad guys
[4:22:12.040 --> 4:22:16.940]  have it hidden. That was the rule. The good guys have it in the open. You have your weapon
[4:22:16.940 --> 4:22:22.840]  out in the open, but see, they made it out of style, uncool to carry. That's why in the
[4:22:22.840 --> 4:22:27.680]  famous Lindberg trial, you know, everybody, you can watch the news reels had their guns
[4:22:27.680 --> 4:22:31.800]  in the front row, you know, and, and, and people were saying, well, how can you let
[4:22:31.800 --> 4:22:36.880]  Lindberg in? He may shoot the guy that kidnapped the baby. But, but, you know, but the issue
[4:22:36.880 --> 4:22:43.400]  was we've gone from guns in court to my dad just 40 years ago, or I guess like 42 years
[4:22:43.400 --> 4:22:48.360]  ago in college. I mean, in high school, just taking a shotgun in and putting in his locker
[4:22:48.360 --> 4:22:54.080]  to, oh my God, you know, the, the schools are now little prisons so that the shooter
[4:22:54.080 --> 4:22:58.600]  can come there knowing that no one will stand up to him.
[4:22:58.600 --> 4:23:06.920]  Yeah, that was a 10 minute rant. I apologize. Well, listen, tell me more about the Phoenix
[4:23:06.920 --> 4:23:13.920]  police. So, so that's a good headline for us. Phoenix police told Chris told, you know,
[4:23:13.920 --> 4:23:19.720]  you know, open carry demonstrator at Obama event that they supported you. What else did
[4:23:19.720 --> 4:23:20.720]  they say?
[4:23:20.720 --> 4:23:25.800]  That was about it. I mean, that was everything. Just that they were just there to keep the
[4:23:25.800 --> 4:23:30.040]  peace and they had no problem with what we were doing. And that's it.
[4:23:30.040 --> 4:23:33.920]  And of course, there were other guys. Did you know the other guys that were out there
[4:23:33.920 --> 4:23:34.920]  armed?
[4:23:34.920 --> 4:23:41.920]  Uh, just I was acquainted kind of loosely acquainted with, with other people, just a
[4:23:41.920 --> 4:23:44.840]  few, just like three or four other people there.
[4:23:44.840 --> 4:23:49.160]  And the police didn't pull anybody over, follow them home or not at all.
[4:23:49.160 --> 4:23:53.480]  Not at all. They didn't even ask for anyone's information. I didn't even have any identification
[4:23:53.480 --> 4:23:57.920]  on me. I had purposely left telephone keys, ID, everything at home.
[4:23:57.920 --> 4:24:02.120]  Now, now look at England. First, they say we're going to line everybody up and ask you
[4:24:02.120 --> 4:24:05.680]  questions. It's happened to me. It's happened to both the Watson brothers who live there.
[4:24:05.680 --> 4:24:09.400]  Happens to their parents. Happens to everybody now. They just go, excuse me, line up, checking
[4:24:09.400 --> 4:24:13.800]  these. Thank you. Are you a terrorist? Are you a pedophile? Oh, and I had the Wall Street
[4:24:13.800 --> 4:24:18.400]  Journal writer here. That happened to her repeatedly when she was in England doing a
[4:24:18.400 --> 4:24:26.520]  story about, uh, tourism. I mean, it's just everywhere. And now under the TSA model from
[4:24:26.520 --> 4:24:32.240]  the, uh, airports, they admit that airport model of being searched, submitting the act
[4:24:32.240 --> 4:24:38.000]  of prostration, taking your shoes off the act of submitting the act of being, this is
[4:24:38.000 --> 4:24:42.400]  all about training us to where you're not even nervous. Now, if you fly a lot, you're
[4:24:42.400 --> 4:24:46.760]  like, no big deal going to the checkpoint. You're not nervous. They're pleased by that.
[4:24:46.760 --> 4:24:51.320]  Ah, this, the enslavement is going well. Comments on that.
[4:24:51.320 --> 4:24:55.760]  Uh, I know exactly what you're talking about. A good example of that is, uh, there's a border
[4:24:55.760 --> 4:25:02.920]  patrol checkpoint and, uh, I think it's between, between Hila Bend and it's just west of Hila
[4:25:02.920 --> 4:25:08.200]  Bend, I believe, and I think it's like 60 or 70 miles away from the border. And, uh, my
[4:25:08.200 --> 4:25:12.920]  pastor, uh, Baptist pastor actually got beat up by the border patrol at that, at that checkpoint,
[4:25:12.920 --> 4:25:16.320]  which has nothing to do with the border. It doesn't even run north and south. And all
[4:25:16.320 --> 4:25:19.800]  they do is just ask you whether you're a citizen or not. And I believe that this checkpoint,
[4:25:19.800 --> 4:25:24.320]  the only purpose of it is to get us used to stopping throughout our daily lives and answering
[4:25:24.320 --> 4:25:28.960]  questions to federal agents. And yeah, so I know exactly what you're talking about.
[4:25:28.960 --> 4:25:32.600]  Oh, it's been documented. As you know, they just waived the illegals through, but they
[4:25:32.600 --> 4:25:37.520]  see a family of Americans, black, white, Hispanic. It's like, we're going to have one
[4:25:37.520 --> 4:25:39.600]  hell of a time today, boy.
[4:25:39.600 --> 4:25:44.880]  I'm going to teach him how to be slaves. Now I'm starting to clear a picture. You go to
[4:25:44.880 --> 4:25:49.880]  pastor Anderson's church. I see. Yeah, yeah, I do. Proudly. I think it's the best church
[4:25:49.880 --> 4:25:52.080]  in the world.
[4:25:52.080 --> 4:25:56.600]  So more and more and more, he's the pastor beat up within an inch of his life for just
[4:25:56.600 --> 4:26:03.680]  asking the, the, the, the Lordships. How is that going with him right now? It's just
[4:26:03.680 --> 4:26:08.440]  a circus, the court, the whole of the court processes is the total circus. And I couldn't
[4:26:08.440 --> 4:26:13.760]  be and explain how we glue the criticism.
[4:26:13.760 --> 4:26:19.920]  Well, this has been an amazing interview and I appreciate you spending time with us today.
[4:26:19.920 --> 4:26:26.280]  And I look forward to having you back on as this develops and as this unfolds. And we
[4:26:26.280 --> 4:26:33.920]  just appreciate you, Chris, and your courage doing this. It just shows how one person can
[4:26:33.920 --> 4:26:41.080]  change the world. The guy in New Hampshire starts it. It spreads to Arizona. Now people
[4:26:41.080 --> 4:26:48.000]  all over the country are doing open carry and the illusion, the grip of enslavement is loosening,
[4:26:48.000 --> 4:26:52.000]  but the enemy is getting ready to counter strike against all of us. So pray for Chris, pray
[4:26:52.000 --> 4:26:56.160]  for myself, pray for my whole crew, pray for what we're doing because I didn't spend any
[4:26:56.160 --> 4:27:00.960]  time on it today, but the enemy's coming after us at every level. I have felt a disturbance
[4:27:00.960 --> 4:27:05.960]  in the forest as well. So we'll see you back live tomorrow. Retransmission starts now.
[4:27:05.960 --> 4:27:06.960]  Thank you so much, Chris.
[4:27:06.960 --> 4:27:07.960]  No problem.
[4:27:07.960 --> 4:27:08.960]  Thanks, Alex.
[4:27:08.960 --> 4:27:14.320]  Take care, buddy. It's great to be real, great to be alive, great to be part of the second
[4:27:14.320 --> 4:27:21.960]  American Revolution to restore the Republic, the spirit of 1776. Don't tread on me. Great
[4:27:21.960 --> 4:27:22.960]  job, crew.
[4:27:22.960 --> 4:27:29.960]  Thank you.
