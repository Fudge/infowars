[00:00.000 --> 00:15.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:15.000 --> 00:35.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:35.000 --> 00:43.000]  So I might as well begin to put some action in my life.
[00:43.000 --> 00:50.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, the new national sport is to have the big corporate media,
[00:50.000 --> 00:54.000]  along with all the major Fortune 500 corporations,
[00:54.000 --> 01:01.000]  Facebook, Twitter, Google, YouTube, all publicly concerted now,
[01:01.000 --> 01:09.000]  going out and bullying libertarians, conservatives, anyone with blonde hair, blue eyes, anyone who's white.
[01:09.000 --> 01:20.000]  This is a massive move of the Overton window into insanity, into malice style revolution in their own words.
[01:20.000 --> 01:29.000]  Whether it's Uber or whether it's banks or whether it's other companies or whether it's a flower shop or Starbucks,
[01:29.000 --> 01:35.000]  you go in and they say, admit racism is a problem and white people are really evil.
[01:35.000 --> 01:42.000]  Literally. And if you don't say that, they then refuse your service.
[01:42.000 --> 01:48.000]  Remember Starbucks tried this about six months ago and it killed their stock 25% so they backed off for a while.
[01:48.000 --> 01:58.000]  I've got reports pouring in at infowars.com where you go in a flower shop or you go in a bakery or you go anywhere.
[01:58.000 --> 02:02.000]  It's happening in Austin and it's white people mainly. They're bullying you.
[02:02.000 --> 02:07.000]  But if you're also a, quote, minority, they want you to announce it like you're in a cult
[02:07.000 --> 02:12.000]  and say you're in the solidarity to create a buzz on the street of total hysteria.
[02:12.000 --> 02:19.000]  And now it's only intensified. I have epic, total proof of this.
[02:19.000 --> 02:23.000]  And by the way, CNN didn't accidentally release this.
[02:23.000 --> 02:34.000]  CNN is just putting out the teleprompter screed that they're projecting on these panel shows, most of which are staged,
[02:34.000 --> 02:39.000]  and it says, quote, ordinary people made Charlottesville possible.
[02:39.000 --> 02:48.000]  And they're saying, see, you are in the KKK because you don't follow the exact political system of carbon taxes, global government.
[02:48.000 --> 02:54.000]  Then they cut to this piece and it says, CNN, blame President Trump for his tepid moral response,
[02:54.000 --> 03:01.000]  call the neo-Nazis and white nationalist thugs, fill your Facebook and Twitter accounts with moral outrage.
[03:01.000 --> 03:04.000]  They're telling you what you're supposed to do.
[03:04.000 --> 03:10.000]  And then my email, my wife's email, everyone I know with just companies we use,
[03:10.000 --> 03:15.000]  we're realizing how globalist they are because its message is about the white supremacists are everywhere.
[03:15.000 --> 03:22.000]  They're deadly, we understand it, but don't worry, let's all work together and let's report anyone and let's refuse service to anybody.
[03:22.000 --> 03:30.000]  This is if you've used Uber, it's telling you to walk around like you're a college student, fresh out of high school, showing up scared at college,
[03:30.000 --> 03:36.000]  and they go, get into this dormitory quick, there's white supremacists on campus, but we'll teach you, we'll protect you.
[03:36.000 --> 03:41.000]  This is your group. This is like cult kidnapping.
[03:41.000 --> 03:48.000]  This is like cult setting up new age cults at campuses. That's what the government is. It's crazy.
[03:48.000 --> 03:54.000]  And then it coordinates with Facebook and Google and Twitter to make you feel like everyone's agreeing with you,
[03:54.000 --> 03:59.000]  and then by successive approximation you're put into a total cult bubble.
[03:59.000 --> 04:06.000]  And then this, it's on infowars.com right now, newswars.com, Steve Watson exclusive.
[04:06.000 --> 04:16.000]  From the ACLU themselves, they put out an image, put it on screen, of a little blonde haired boy or girl, you're not sure,
[04:16.000 --> 04:27.000]  and they got an American flag and a little lion toy in their hand, and it talks about how the ACLU stands up for American values.
[04:27.000 --> 04:31.000]  They literally were hit with thousands of tweets and comments even by media people saying,
[04:31.000 --> 04:36.000]  how insensitive you racist a blonde baby.
[04:36.000 --> 04:45.000]  And the ACLU apologized and removed it and said, thank you for teaching us. We are sorry.
[04:45.000 --> 04:49.000]  And then the tweet responses are epic.
[04:49.000 --> 04:55.000]  When people going good, we don't want to see white filth, we want to see shotguns in their heads, we want to see white's dad.
[04:55.000 --> 04:59.000]  And it's mainly white people. Oh my, saying it.

[08:16.000 --> 08:25.000]  We now take you live to the central Texas command center in the heart of the resistance. It's Alex Jones.
[08:25.000 --> 08:30.000]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome to another global transmission.
[08:30.000 --> 08:33.000]  I'm going to tell you about the big guess we've got the huge breaking news.
[08:33.000 --> 08:41.000]  The bottom line is the globalists now admit they're starting a civil war in this country and we've entered a shocking new chapter.
[08:41.000 --> 08:53.000]  That if we're aware of what's happening and like judo use their momentum and their action against us as a major time to separate ourselves financially more and more from the globalist.
[08:53.000 --> 09:08.000]  If we use their tools against them we're going to have absolute devastating death blow political and cultural victory.
[09:08.000 --> 09:22.000]  CNN MSNBC ABC News USA Day are all announcing go out and bully everyday people ask them if they voted for Trump and then get in their face and tell them they're a white supremacist.
[09:22.000 --> 09:34.000]  Fire them remove them ostracize them there's the CNN headline white supremacist by default how ordinary people made Charlottesville possible.
[09:34.000 --> 09:43.000]  Oh my gosh how the left brought in all the jihadi Muslims that killed 30 times what died in Charlottesville the last week.
[09:43.000 --> 09:50.000]  But that's just each knife attack each car attack just a blip on the radar don't even call it Islamic.
[09:50.000 --> 09:56.000]  Hell CNN said maybe it's because of Charlottesville we see Islamic attacks maybe they're copying the conservatives.
[09:56.000 --> 10:12.000]  So this is a complete full on bullying operation and I have stacks of articles here documenting it where they actually say that you need to get out on the street and getting people's faces.
[10:12.000 --> 10:22.000]  Blame President Trump for his kept the moral response this is CNN call the neo Nazis and white nationalist thugs fill your Facebook and Twitter accounts with moral outrage.
[10:22.000 --> 10:33.000]  It's not enough CNN says because the average person quote ordinary people elected Trump and they're responsible see oh somebody dies from a gun.
[10:33.000 --> 10:37.000]  It's all gun owners fault.
[10:37.000 --> 10:46.000]  Somebody runs over a young woman in the middle of a melee where the police stand down it is collectively your fault.
[10:46.000 --> 10:59.000]  This is hard core Soviet style policies and we've all got to buck this weather this storm and become stronger through it and realize this is a corporate system of compliance.
[10:59.000 --> 11:09.000]  They say everybody be nice everybody be sweet and business you want everybody's business is how they sell this everybody be friendly.
[11:09.000 --> 11:18.000]  But then the globalist stimulate the pressure groups the astroturf to come in with super radical demands.
[11:18.000 --> 11:30.000]  And then the corporations acquiesce to those demands and then act like it's normal for government and academia and churches to all acquiesce to the demands.
[11:30.000 --> 11:39.000]  And suddenly you're the bad guy if you don't want to teach five year olds and kindergarten how to have anal sex or how to masturbate that's what goes on.
[11:39.000 --> 11:46.000]  Now pedophilia sexualization of children if some guy did that to park to your daughter you'd get up and punch him in the nose.
[11:46.000 --> 11:52.000]  Some lady did that to your son in the park you punch him in the nose you'd call the police they'd go to jail.
[11:52.000 --> 12:06.000]  But as long as it's done around openness and done around not being racist or sexist or as long as it's you're not a homophobe then it's completely normalized.
[12:06.000 --> 12:11.000]  But what's not normal oh the family don't say you have a mother and father.
[12:11.000 --> 12:23.000]  Use a she or he and don't talk about Miller female because someone else might not be that now language itself evil you think oh well this is just craziness they've gone off the reservation their nuts.
[12:23.000 --> 12:27.000]  No they're not it's a scientific plan.
[12:27.000 --> 12:34.000]  This is on info wars dot com right now we're going to go over it more in detail but I'm going to just mention it hysteria.
[12:34.000 --> 12:40.000]  Leftist triggered by ACLU tweeting photo of a white baby.
[12:40.000 --> 12:49.000]  Little white baby boy girl you really can't tell nice blue sky.
[12:49.000 --> 13:00.000]  Talks about the ACLU defends America's values of free speech and they had him back and they say how insulting and insensitive a white person a white supremacist.
[13:00.000 --> 13:09.000]  And they go oh my god you're right we apologize thank you for correcting us and they took it down a white kid with a flag.
[13:09.000 --> 13:11.000]  And keep scrolling down.
[13:11.000 --> 13:17.000]  I'd rather have this future and then it shows a black woman with a gun.
[13:17.000 --> 13:28.000]  But only a black woman with a gun actually thought someone retweeted a white genocide account on to my timeline that's right a little white kid with an American flag is not acceptable.
[13:28.000 --> 13:30.000]  Supporting Nazis.
[13:30.000 --> 13:42.000]  Even tweeting little blonde kids get your bleep together oh yeah supporting Nazis now to say that people have a right to free speech see that's why CNN had reports yesterday saying it's time to end free speech that's right.
[13:42.000 --> 13:46.000]  Nazis yes we must ban Nazis and then free speech.
[13:46.000 --> 13:54.000]  You need help if a picture of a small white child triggers you does it take a lot of energy to offend all the time.
[13:54.000 --> 14:04.000]  The reason there's an issue with this tweet in context the ACLU has recently been criticized for supporting white supremacists that's right for just saying First Amendment First Amendment.
[14:04.000 --> 14:13.000]  What a blonde folk I don't get this silly post the future ACLU wants is a little blonde kid.
[14:13.000 --> 14:34.000]  Your chip on the shoulder minorities taught to be classically tribal classically racist with a bunch of other white allies tweeting thousands of them but the best part is the ACLU said thank you for showing us how to be better you're right what we did was wrong and insensitive.
[14:34.000 --> 14:44.000]  Just like the man named Robert Lee who's Chinese who was going to call a baseball game.
[14:44.000 --> 14:49.000]  For the social engineering network ESPN.
[14:49.000 --> 14:57.000]  And they said sorry you basically can't work here anymore your names Robert Lee.
[14:57.000 --> 15:05.000]  Probably 30 million Chinese with the name Lee sorry folks you're in trouble just like Lynch Hall being banned.
[15:05.000 --> 15:18.000]  Robert Lee ESPN under fire for taking announcer off UVA game and CNN can play the good cop see in the Overton window look they move it way over here to families are bad mothers are bad.
[15:18.000 --> 15:21.000]  Everything's evil that's traditional.
[15:21.000 --> 15:29.000]  White kids are bad but then over here more reasonable oh ESPN you want a little too far he's an Asian man.
[15:29.000 --> 15:37.000]  He should be allowed to have the last name Lee you know let's be reasonable now we understand you're trying to be good but you're under fire for that so.
[15:37.000 --> 15:48.000]  And the whole attention isn't gross domestic product isn't literature isn't math isn't science it's just I saw something called Lynch I saw something called Lee look look.
[15:48.000 --> 15:51.000]  Right here it's a white baby.
[15:51.000 --> 15:58.000]  The insensitivity is the FCC ban profanity.
[15:58.000 --> 16:05.000]  That's why they want to legalize child porn Nambolo wants people to have access to your kids in the UN agrees with it but.
[16:05.000 --> 16:10.000]  A little white kid is obscene.
[16:10.000 --> 16:19.000]  And you know I read this some in Dallas when I was young I had blonde hair it was good looking and blue eyes and.
[16:19.000 --> 16:23.000]  I would have like liberal white people.
[16:23.000 --> 16:27.000]  Say are you a Nazi.
[16:27.000 --> 16:33.000]  I'd be wearing like a Metallica shirt and blue jeans and cowboy boots and I'd say excuse me.
[16:33.000 --> 16:40.000]  I would always think it was like a joke or something I remember being in a record store buying a cassette tape.
[16:40.000 --> 16:44.000]  And I walked over and was buying it from the guy behind the counter was kind of beatnik looking.
[16:44.000 --> 16:47.000]  So I was just an Americana guy.
[16:47.000 --> 16:52.000]  He goes I can't wait till this Nazi technology's been phased out and come out with CDs.
[16:52.000 --> 16:54.000]  What do you think of Nazis.
[16:54.000 --> 17:00.000]  I was like yeah I didn't really even know that Nazis invented tape.
[17:00.000 --> 17:03.000]  I bought tape got invented a lot of places.
[17:03.000 --> 17:06.000]  Just like radio got invented in three different countries at the same time.
[17:06.000 --> 17:07.000]  I was like are you kids.
[17:07.000 --> 17:11.000]  Oh you know a lot about history.
[17:11.000 --> 17:13.000]  And it was just real nasty.
[17:13.000 --> 17:20.000]  And then I learned that's his uniform braided beards you know dreadlocks I didn't care I didn't look down on him.
[17:20.000 --> 17:25.000]  I wasn't a bigot that he was a white guy who hated white people.
[17:25.000 --> 17:32.000]  I was just in there to buy my cassette tape of Van Halen or something.
[17:32.000 --> 17:38.000]  But I learned it like 15 16 something's something's going on.
[17:38.000 --> 17:41.000]  And then I went to college a couple of years and made it matter what class it was.
[17:41.000 --> 17:44.000]  They marched you in and said whites are inherently evil.
[17:44.000 --> 17:49.000]  They'd hold up a picture of a person that looked like somebody from Egypt and they'd say this is going to be the perfect person.
[17:49.000 --> 17:54.000]  We're all just brown and there's no more white people and it was always a white professor saying.
[17:54.000 --> 17:59.000]  I had one math teacher that was a black lady who'd been a liberal and been to Africa.
[17:59.000 --> 18:03.000]  I remember her not doing the propaganda and going you hear a lot of bad stuff about America.
[18:03.000 --> 18:09.000]  But let me tell you I've been to Africa and it's it's bad and what you hear all this liberal stuff on campus isn't quite accurate.
[18:09.000 --> 18:15.000]  There was one lady that wasn't just it matter where it was just hammering us with rainwashing.
[18:15.000 --> 18:20.000]  And I was just like I'm going to go get a sales job and I'm going to go get into media and I'm going to do something about this.
[18:20.000 --> 18:26.000]  I said I'm out of here.
[18:26.000 --> 18:33.000]  But then you read these articles and go over these stories and it's it's right there.
[18:33.000 --> 18:48.000]  I've got articles here where coffee shops flower shops florist you go in and they say we want you to denounce racism or we're going to refuse you service.
[18:48.000 --> 18:51.000]  Well I mean if somebody said that to me I'd say I thought what is this a cult.
[18:51.000 --> 18:57.000]  I'm in here to get grandma or my wife flowers or get flowers for somebody that's been sick at work.
[18:57.000 --> 19:04.000]  I'm not here to bow down to you with some priest class that I've got to kiss your butt kiss your ring.
[19:04.000 --> 19:08.000]  There is a Chicago flower shop refuses to business with bigots daily news.
[19:08.000 --> 19:13.000]  But what they're really doing is making first contact like a police officer or an interrogator.
[19:13.000 --> 19:18.000]  It's like a TSA verbal screening.
[19:18.000 --> 19:26.000]  See oh you won't make a gay couple their cake you get sued the government gets behind that suit.
[19:26.000 --> 19:28.000]  I'm a libertarian I think you should make the cake.
[19:28.000 --> 19:32.000]  But oh we're going to refuse all of you service and we're going to attack you in restaurants.
[19:32.000 --> 19:41.000]  We're going to spit on you on the street and we're going to do it and scream Nazi at you when we're a bunch of thugs acting like Nazis because it's time for us to have power.
[19:41.000 --> 19:45.000]  And this is our revolution and we were supposed to have it with Hillary.
[19:45.000 --> 19:47.000]  And after all the president's mentally ill.
[19:47.000 --> 19:49.000]  We told you that back on May.
[19:49.000 --> 19:50.000]  Roger Stone's coming up.
[19:50.000 --> 19:57.000]  I hope you'll tell you the inside baseball how he learned it because he learned their new talking point would be Alzheimer's and now it's everywhere.
[19:57.000 --> 20:23.000]  Stay with us.
[20:23.000 --> 20:41.000]  Are you one of the 15 million men who suffer from an enlarged prostate if your life revolves around finding the closest bathroom if you're tired of waking up many times the night to urinate then you need to know about prostate miracle prostate

[22:02.000 --> 22:04.000]  Those times may be near.
[22:04.000 --> 22:05.000]  Think about it.
[22:05.000 --> 22:09.000]  Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea.
[22:09.000 --> 22:20.000]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns and our crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long term outages from a single cyber attack.
[22:20.000 --> 22:27.000]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency.

[23:26.000 --> 23:32.000]  If you had purchased $100 of Bitcoin in 2010 today you'd have $2,600,000.

[23:52.000 --> 23:54.000]  That's procoincurrency.net.
[23:54.000 --> 24:10.000]  The deadline for 10 cent guarantee is August 31st.
[24:24.000 --> 24:44.000]  Even the KKK wouldn't complain about the ACLU tweeting out a little picture of a black child with an American flag.
[24:44.000 --> 24:53.000]  Even the KKK but the main line liberals say you sent out a picture of a white child this is insulting and it's not satire.
[24:53.000 --> 25:02.000]  People asked Atlantic Monthly last week they said your article saying the total eclipse is racist because it mainly hits white areas of the country.
[25:02.000 --> 25:12.000]  Are you joking and they said no we're serious and they said well you look like fools and they go you'll see because they don't look like fools.
[25:12.000 --> 25:31.000]  They are getting a cult of people that literally think that I was talking to Bartender years ago and I even saw something about this in the news that Negro Mandela was talking about changing their name because Negro means black in Spanish and it's dark beer.
[25:31.000 --> 25:42.000]  That's all it means just like you know you go to the store and it says black rum you know dark rum. Something's dark doesn't mean it's against black people. It means it's got a rum I like.
[25:42.000 --> 25:52.000]  But the point is that I've even seen articles where they're like calling porno movies named chocolate this or whatever racist.
[25:52.000 --> 26:02.000]  Well the women it's a nice term chocolate it's saying you're not allowed to have any language period.
[26:02.000 --> 26:04.000]  It's mind control.
[26:04.000 --> 26:08.000]  It's absolute war on communication.
[26:08.000 --> 26:29.000]  And the best example of this is Robert Lee a Asian American and ESPN has worked there it turns out for close to a decade as an announcer for sporting events and they go listen dude we're pulling you because you may be triggering.
[26:29.000 --> 26:37.000]  Wow that sounds like a mental asylum.
[26:37.000 --> 26:47.000]  Oh and the media talks about Stephen Bannon says oh he calls it a war. He calls it a war machine and Alex Jones calls it info wars.
[26:47.000 --> 26:54.000]  They're the ones that are in a war against us with lies. It is an info war. That's what the Pentagon calls it.
[26:54.000 --> 27:01.000]  And we need to wake up and realize they know they're lying. They know you're not racist.
[27:01.000 --> 27:16.000]  They know it's garbage. But they are projecting on to every single person in America this mental illness of having chips on our shoulders so we can all be put into different groups and controlled according to what color we are.
[27:16.000 --> 27:34.000]  Instead of what we actually stand for and do they are overturning 108 degrees the work of Martin Luther King that said judge people by the character of their deeds and what they do not what color they are and isn't that common sense.
[27:34.000 --> 27:49.000]  That I'll hire somebody if they're black, Hispanic, Asian, white. I don't care if they're smart and hard working and got a good sense of humor. In fact I like but I put my ads out to hire more quote minorities but you know what a lot of them tell us in the emails back.
[27:49.000 --> 27:56.000]  They say listen I'm not working for you. You're racist.
[27:56.000 --> 28:10.000]  You see the real racist social engineers just cut them out of their future and they're telling them you can't be part of the Tea Party and low taxes and self defense and prosperity because America is racist because capitalism is racist.
[28:10.000 --> 28:19.000]  Why? Because the globalist social engineers are billionaires and they control trillions and almost to a man.
[28:19.000 --> 28:37.000]  They have ganged up to take control of the economy, dumb the public down, make everybody be race obsessed while they steal the future, steal the technology, steal the money and are tax exempt and then point their finger at what's left of the free market in the middle class and say that's racist repudiated.
[28:37.000 --> 28:45.000]  You don't have any part at 4th of July. You don't have any part in nice cars and swimming pools and good medical care and the right to religion.
[28:45.000 --> 28:53.000]  You don't have any part of that of your Hispanic even though you're going to be 70% of America in about 30 years.
[28:53.000 --> 29:06.000]  You had kids. You thought that was valuable. You thought life was valuable. You went out, you did that and you're hard working on average. You're going to inherit America. You've already got America.
[29:06.000 --> 29:21.000]  They're trying to tell you, no, no, no. Oh, no, no, no, no. You want Venezuela. You want North Korea. You want a socialist failed state. You want what South Africa's turned into.
[29:21.000 --> 29:37.000]  You want that, don't you? And they're telling the black people that and boy, the black folks on average, you bought it and they're more poor and they're more in prison and they're more absolutely on the street and the highest rates of everything.
[29:37.000 --> 29:48.000]  You can imagine illegitimacy all because they signed on the Democrats and overnight were destroyed because it's by design big news coming up. Stay with us.

[33:15.000 --> 33:31.000]  We have a stack of CNN MSNBC articles, London independent stories, you name it, with the Democrats and the globalists at the Soros crowd have announced their plan for a revolution of in pecking and bullying at point blank range.
[33:31.000 --> 33:42.000]  Remember six months ago, Starbucks said they were going to ask everybody if they were racist or if they were concerned about racism or to donate to Black Lives Matter or to say that they were sorry as a white person?
[33:42.000 --> 33:53.000]  That is reeducation camp level brainwashing. Their stock took a close to 25% drop as people exited and basically ran as far as they could from Starbucks.
[33:53.000 --> 34:05.000]  But they're back now with flower shops and other businesses saying are you a racist? Because if you are, we're not going to serve you if you're white coming in and it's white people doing it.
[34:05.000 --> 34:17.000]  ACLU has issued an apology for tweeting on an image of a white two-year-old talking about America's future. That was triggering, that was racist. They have now apologized.
[34:17.000 --> 34:26.000]  But ladies and gentlemen, I have a way to defeat this. They're not the productive folks in the blue states. That's a scientific fact that's admitted.
[34:26.000 --> 34:43.000]  Geographically, 85% of the country is now Republican. We can take the entire country back. They know they're in crisis, so they're involved in a death row battle to overthrow free speech and have the mouse that roared intimidate the lion.
[34:43.000 --> 34:57.000]  The answer is, why are you buying stuff on Amazon when Bezos is sworn to overthrow the Second Amendment, the First Amendment, owns the Washington Post, lying about Trump, you name it? Why are you giving money to big corporations?
[34:57.000 --> 35:07.000]  Why are you supporting them? It's now time, folks, to brutally cut your cable off and let them know why you did. To brutally not go to the corporate hotels and let them know why.
[35:07.000 --> 35:23.000]  To brutally not go to Starbucks. To brutally stop buying on Amazon. We went off Amazon a few years ago because of this. They run massive scams. It's racketeering. It's organized crime. It is well-known monopoly activity.
[35:23.000 --> 35:33.000]  They're above the law. They get $1.48 every package of taxpayer money. Think about that. And they're killing Main Street. They're even killing the evil Walmart. They're so cancerous.
[35:33.000 --> 35:49.000]  That cancer is now dying because the bigger cancer is getting all the blood. Ladies and gentlemen, this isn't left as stuff we're seeing. This is global corporate intimidation telling their people to go mega aggro and physically attack folks.
[35:49.000 --> 36:05.000]  You've got videos of them beating up their own antifa because they look too white. And it's white people doing it. And they're in a hysteria, a crazed, out-of-control, malice freakout, which they admit in the literature they've been planning.
[36:05.000 --> 36:18.000]  So the answer to all of this is pulling out of it more and more. Pulling out of their schools. Pulling out of their public systems. Not sending your kids to get a worthless degree at these big colleges.
[36:18.000 --> 36:36.000]  So what if your wife was in a sorority or you were in whatever? You need to cut this cancer off now and set your daughter up with an entrepreneurial business or something and teach her how to own a lawn mower company or a pool company or a restaurant.
[36:36.000 --> 36:52.000]  Or to go write a book. 90% of the degrees are worthless. It's all a joke. You need to pull out of their system completely because there's no future if we don't. They're not going to coexist.
[36:52.000 --> 37:03.000]  They're not liberal. They're not tolerant. They're the opposite of Martin Luther King and they have scientifically been induced to go insane.
[37:03.000 --> 37:20.000]  Now, let's look at DrudgeReport.com today. We also have these stories up on NewsWars.com. USA Today, page one. Debating Trump mental health becomes cottage industry.
[37:20.000 --> 37:41.000]  Why dims can't capitalize on president's blunders? Trump taps Hulk as fitness guru. Now, when you read through all this, I have a whole bunch of these videos where they say Trump has early onset of dementia.
[37:41.000 --> 37:55.000]  Trump is mentally ill. Trump needs to be removed from office. We need to implement the 25th Amendment on and on and on and on and on. Now, why is that important?
[37:55.000 --> 38:13.000]  Because we broke back in May of this year in studio but also on the streets of Austin doing a live feed while Democrats drove by and said FU in close to darkness on the side of downtown.
[38:13.000 --> 38:22.000]  This is very cinematic. Some reason those videos get three times as many views. We like to shoot stuff on the street at night.
[38:22.000 --> 38:37.000]  Roger Stone says, I've just gotten intel and I don't know how much of this I can tell you of where he got the source but he talks to people at major newspapers that are in editorial meetings and they're in the meetings going,
[38:37.000 --> 38:49.000]  We don't think the Russian narrative is ever going to work. It's going to play out. Our focus groups show nobody buys into it, six, seven percent. But maybe we can get something criminal as part of the investigation finding something somebody did wrong.
[38:49.000 --> 38:56.000]  That's why they've expanded the dragnet to all his customers, his renters, his businesses, his pure harassment.
[38:56.000 --> 39:12.000]  And there's the Austin American statesman that memorialized the fact that Roger Stone broke it. Roger Stone and Alex Jones warn of Alzheimer's claim to remove Trump. Jonathan Till Love and the date is May 16, 2017.
[39:12.000 --> 39:26.000]  So, again, why do they call us fake news? We told you, pardon was coming for our pile first. You now hear it's going to happen.
[39:26.000 --> 39:43.000]  And Time Magazine pulls their hair out says, oh my God, Alex Jones and Matt Drudge and Jerome Corsi and Roger Stone got the information to Trump. Yes, it was gotten personally to Trump face to face. It was gotten Trump over a telephone call.
[39:43.000 --> 40:00.000]  It was gotten reinforced when he then saw it two days later on Drudge. And I'm going to leave it at that. Yes, yes, the president is actually paying attention and learned that our pile without a jury trial was given at least six months in prison, maybe longer.
[40:00.000 --> 40:14.000]  But again, why do they call us fake news? Because I told you 20 years ago that scientific Atlantic cable boxes had microphones listening to you, putting it into keyword aggregate software to then data mine the information, create an algorithm of your personality and sell the data.
[40:14.000 --> 40:20.000]  And the Time Warner cable was involved. I was told that by one of their top engineers.
[40:20.000 --> 40:33.000]  20 years later, I think I can say a little bit more about the source was an engineer in Time Warner. The guy drove a $300,000 black Bentley.
[40:33.000 --> 40:41.000]  I looked up who he was. It's true. He gave me the intel. Show me the schematics, everything.
[40:41.000 --> 41:03.000]  But I'm digressing. Then I had other whistleblowers kind of me, former NSA, some of them public who'd been in the NSA and exposed how it all worked. And I told you in 2005 and 2004 that Google was watching and listening to you over new smartphones, laptops, and your little web cameras.
[41:03.000 --> 41:14.000]  And then exactly word for word with Paul Watson wrote and what I said was later announced yesterday. Now, how do we get it exactly right?
[41:14.000 --> 41:23.000]  Because there was a specific press release to stockholders that listeners sent us wasn't public, but it wasn't secret.
[41:23.000 --> 41:39.000]  It was to stockholders of Google that they're pioneering listening to everyone in their houses over microphones and watching them to then, if your dog's barking was a innocuous example, to make it sound okay to stockholders.
[41:39.000 --> 41:44.000]  Oh, you're going to make money. You know, first get the money class into it. We're watching and listening, but it's okay. You're going to make money.
[41:44.000 --> 41:54.000]  Dog barks will put dog food ads up on the computer. It's like Count Dracula comes over and says, mind if I come in your house whenever I want?
[41:54.000 --> 42:02.000]  Like if I see a window open, might have I crawl upon your roof and close it just to be friendly? By the way, your neck looks quite delicious this evening.
[42:02.000 --> 42:07.000]  You know, if I ever see your house on fire, mind if I have permission to come in? Oh, have you ever seen my house on fire coming in?
[42:07.000 --> 42:15.000]  They're like, oh, thank you for that. We just want to know if you've got a dog listening to you. It's a little puppy dog.
[42:15.000 --> 42:21.000]  It's the same way they see their psychopaths. Same way a creeper in a van. I have a puppy. I have a puppy.
[42:21.000 --> 42:26.000]  Same way. Oh, we just want to know if they have a dog. We're listening to them. We're going to have dog food ads. It's all very innocuous.
[42:26.000 --> 42:36.000]  And of course, they will give you dog food ads. That is part of it. Part of the entire billions of things they're going to know about you to track your whole life with AI computers watching you.
[42:36.000 --> 42:43.000]  Maybe guardian angels don't exist in the real world spiritually. Maybe they don't.
[42:43.000 --> 42:58.000]  I know they do. The point is, these little babies, I left my, my, it's not my phone. It's a smart phone, little tracker, little digital, little digital goblin that watches and listens and tracks everything I do.
[42:58.000 --> 43:05.000]  It's a little guardian devil. Yes, smart phones are and smart meters and all this tech in your house, they admits watching, listening to you.
[43:05.000 --> 43:11.000]  And oh, hooked into the smart meter, the city put on. It just so happens to scan all those frequencies and grab those and sell them.
[43:11.000 --> 43:17.000]  And there's a whole boom rush on that too.
[43:17.000 --> 43:23.000]  So Roger Stone talks to 30, 40, 50 reporters a day.
[43:23.000 --> 43:31.000]  It's almost OCD. I mean, every time I'm at dinner with him or he's here at the office, he works with him for hours now. He's signed on.
[43:31.000 --> 43:36.000]  Got a contract with him. He just is on the phone with, with every reporter you can imagine.
[43:36.000 --> 43:44.000]  And he said, yeah, no, I have now talked to two different people that were in major editorial board meetings.
[43:44.000 --> 43:53.000]  And they said, first we're going to play out the Russian narrative. Then we're going to say he's racist, which you now notice months later they're doing.
[43:53.000 --> 43:59.000]  And then we're going to say he's got Alzheimer's and dementia and is mentally ill.
[43:59.000 --> 44:07.000]  And they said, we believe that's what we can get the Republican establishment to go with and then have some bill they're going to pass to embarrass him.
[44:07.000 --> 44:17.000]  And I'm like, really? Yeah. And he's like, yeah. And he goes, and I recommend you start talking to the New York Times and the Washington Post and the CNN people and all their newspapers and folks.
[44:17.000 --> 44:22.000]  He goes, and I recommend, you know, go to dinner with me and Jonathan Till Love. I mean, you know, he's not that bad.
[44:22.000 --> 44:27.000]  No, he's just basically there at my family trial trying to hang me up at my toenails.
[44:27.000 --> 44:33.000]  But but still it's true that we got Jonathan Till Love to put out an article.
[44:33.000 --> 44:40.000]  I mean, we didn't get him to stone met with him, I guess, after and Till Love wrote a big article about how we claim the next move is Alzheimer's.
[44:40.000 --> 44:47.000]  No, we didn't claim that. That's what they have in the hopper.
[44:47.000 --> 44:59.000]  Just like I told you, over and over and over and over again, they're planning a COG overthrow of the president and planning a civil war and planning the CIA to kill him.
[44:59.000 --> 45:15.000]  And that right before they do it, they're going to start announcing it on the news to normalize it so that when it actually happens, so that when it actually goes down, everyone is normalized and thinks it's cool.
[45:15.000 --> 45:25.000]  And now I have stacks of news here where they say get out on the street, ask people where they stand.
[45:25.000 --> 45:35.000]  That's just normal people everywhere who are blonde-haired, blue-eyed, or have short haircuts are being stabbed, are being shot, Republican members of the legislatures,
[45:35.000 --> 45:47.000]  of governor's offices, of city councils, of county commissions, of Congress, Scalise, on and on and on, people walk up and they say, are those Republicans?
[45:47.000 --> 45:52.000]  And the Greenskeeper goes, yeah, those are Republicans. And the guy walks up and starts shooting.
[45:52.000 --> 46:00.000]  Or a guy moves in, number two weeks ago, he moves in next door and he says, who's my neighbor? Oh, that's the Republican city council member, really?
[46:00.000 --> 46:09.000]  And they're watching CNN and they're watching MSNBC, walks over, shoots him twice in the head.
[46:09.000 --> 46:19.000]  And why not? CNN said, the headlines out today, all Trump voters are white supremacists by default.
[46:19.000 --> 46:26.000]  And you're like, call me a white supremacist, it's not true. You don't understand they're saying, we're going to kill you.
[46:26.000 --> 46:33.000]  We're running a Mao operation. I told you last year, and I told you over and over again, I've been to these rallies all over the country.
[46:33.000 --> 46:43.000]  It's Mao, Red Guard, college students. And they drive Jaguars and Mercedes and their parents work for Time Warner and CNN.
[46:43.000 --> 46:50.000]  And they believe they know they're devil worshipers. They know communism's all fake. They want to get a red takeover.
[46:50.000 --> 46:57.000]  They're going to be like communist generals, folks, running it.
[46:57.000 --> 47:06.000]  We're bringing Roger Stone on here in a minute, but here he is in May, telling you from his sources what the next fake rollout will be.
[47:06.000 --> 47:10.000]  Then after that, he will tell you today what the next rollout will be after that.
[47:10.000 --> 47:23.000]  Infowars learn it years, months or days before it's admitted officially. The opposite of fake news, the sterling, white-hot fount of dedicated truth.
[47:23.000 --> 47:27.000]  Let's go to the Roger Stone clip from May 16th.
[47:27.000 --> 47:35.000]  There's a disclaimer right up front. They're going to say that this is a conspiracy theory, but it's the Stone and the Cold truth.
[47:35.000 --> 47:46.000]  They are going to claim that Donald Trump has Alzheimer's, that it is progressive, and that is progressing, and that is the source of his insanity.
[47:46.000 --> 47:55.000]  I've talked to the President fairly recently. He is sharp as attack. There is no evidence of any deterioration in his thought process.
[47:55.000 --> 48:08.000]  This is completely bogus, but under the 25th Amendment, if a majority of the Cabinet, plus the Vice President, agree that the President is incapacitated, well, then he is removed.
[48:08.000 --> 48:18.000]  And if he seeks to fight the charges, it goes to the U.S. House of Representatives where erosion among Republicans could destroy the Trump presidency.
[48:18.000 --> 48:27.000]  This is bogus. They could not beat him at the ballot box, so now they seek to remove him by claiming that he's insane.
[48:27.000 --> 48:35.000]  Look at his record on the economy. Look at his appointment to the Supreme Court. Look at the way he has the Chinese doing our dirty work in North Korea.
[48:35.000 --> 48:38.000]  You will see he's not crazy. He's a genius.
[48:38.000 --> 48:41.000]  I was about to say, if that's insane, we need more of it.
[48:41.000 --> 48:50.000]  But this is the game plan. Watch carefully. You're going to see the word Alzheimer's more and more in the next several days.
[48:50.000 --> 48:59.000]  I've even been tipped off from leftists about this, that this is the game plan. You heard it first at Infowars.com.
[48:59.000 --> 49:08.000]  That's right. Now it's all admitted. Roger Stone joins us right now. He's out in Los Angeles where they're looking at an Oscar for the Get Me Roger Stone.
[49:08.000 --> 49:14.000]  A lot of powerful stuff going on. I guess for best documentary of 2018 coming up.
[49:14.000 --> 49:19.000]  Roger, just hellstorm of stuff going on. We've got to go to break here in just a moment.
[49:19.000 --> 49:25.000]  But up front here, you didn't make the prediction because I kind of gave away some of the inside baseball.
[49:25.000 --> 49:32.000]  You told me you talked to some people at some high level editorial boards where they were admitting what the next roll out of fraud would be.
[49:32.000 --> 49:46.000]  You're absolutely right, Alex. Here we have it. I predicted it right here on Infowars that they would accuse the president of having senile dementia that they would say that he was mentally unbalanced.
[49:46.000 --> 49:54.000]  This is the direct manifestation of the fact that the whole Russian gambit has failed.
[49:54.000 --> 50:07.000]  So they shifted from Russia to race, where they have been race baiting, where the president clearly denounces violence on the left or the right over racial matters.
[50:07.000 --> 50:13.000]  They're not satisfied with that. So now they're trying to say that he's crazy.
[50:13.000 --> 50:26.000]  CNN is particularly out of control here, Alex. And the extraordinary thing is, and I think I can break this right now, Jeff Zucker is not long for this world at CNN.
[50:26.000 --> 50:47.000]  I am told that the executives at the highest levels of AT&T, who are in the process of acquiring Time Warner, which owns CNN, are very dissatisfied with Zucker's performance at CNN, and that he will be shown the door fairly shortly.
[50:47.000 --> 50:57.000]  So CNN won a 10 million viewers a night again. They would bring back Larry King, and they'd put you on, they'd put me on, but we don't need their platform. They're a joke. They can't, though, they can't give people what they want.
[50:57.000 --> 51:08.000]  Imagine a crossfire with Roger Stone, Alex Jones, and then a couple of the idiot Democrats. No one could look away. They'd have 10 million viewers first week, but it's not going to happen.
[51:08.000 --> 51:24.000]  Well, and what happened last night was quite extraordinary. Ed Martin, who has appeared here at Info Wars a number of times, an outstanding conservative activist who really ran the Trump campaign in Missouri, was up against five critics.
[51:24.000 --> 51:38.000]  And when he had the audacity to come back at the brainless in at Navarro, while all heaven broke loose. Anderson Cooper's supposed to be a moderator, but it was five on one.
[51:38.000 --> 51:55.000]  Today, CNN flew Martin to New York, put him up in a very pricey hotel, and then canceled him when in a Navarro went crying to management that he had the audacity to actually call her out on the air.
[51:55.000 --> 51:58.000]  This woman is unhinged. She really is.
[51:58.000 --> 52:15.000]  And she's the same person putting out the talking point that they issue these talking points and that the president has dementia. Does that have legs? And then what's the next, if you've talked to a lot of folks on the editorial boards of big papers, what's the next thing they're being told to get ready to make up?
[52:15.000 --> 52:30.000]  Well, the president is both mentally and physically sound. It's in a Navarro who was fired by the Jeb and Bush administration for lying about being an attorney and got caught. So who is she to talk about anybody?
[52:30.000 --> 52:55.000]  It's very clear that the predictions that you made, Alex, earlier about our heading towards absolute anarchy and an attempt to take the president out on the streets. In other words, we're going to have violent demonstrations and violence, which we saw in Charlottesville, which we're seeing at the hands of Black Lives Matter and Tifa.
[52:55.000 --> 53:12.000]  And we're seeing CNN, MSNBC, The Washington Post say when violence is for peace, 1984, literally quoted on CNN, Washington Post had had headlines last few days, when violence defends peace. And they're saying we're going to attack you and CNN is legitimizing it.
[53:12.000 --> 53:26.000]  And they're having moderators on and people saying hashtag hunt Republicans. And then they've got the nerve to say that we're the ones calling for a violent revolution. No, we just kicked your butts intellectually with a political revolution.
[53:26.000 --> 53:34.000]  And we've turned the economy back on and righted the ship. And you crazy gremlins are crapping your little britches.
[53:34.000 --> 53:50.000]  No, that's exactly right. What this is really about, Alex, is the last election. They can't get over it. They will not accept the results of a fair democratic election. And therefore they seek to remove Donald Trump by any means necessary.
[53:50.000 --> 54:06.000]  They tried the Electoral College. They tried the recount. They tried the Russia collusion, delusion. These things have all failed. Now they're moving on to claiming that he's mentally unbalanced, that he has dementia. That won't work either.
[54:06.000 --> 54:20.000]  The last stop on this subway is violence. That's where they're headed. When I predicted violence, of course, those on the left say, oh, Stone is advocating violence. No, I don't advocate violence.
[54:20.000 --> 54:38.000]  But I do not think it's 1974. I do not think you're going to have a coup in this country and that patriotic Americans are going to sit there and stand for it. They're going to see it for what it is, an illegitimate, undemocratic, unconstitutional power grab.
[54:38.000 --> 54:50.000]  I love how they let me from below and everything with NBC, Meg and Kelly. With you, the video still they used is like the most unflattering thing. I mean, it's so transparent.
[54:50.000 --> 55:06.000]  Yeah, that's quite a picture of me that they have there. I'm far more handsome than that. But this is typical of the left. Look at the photo that Politico used the other day in covering the fact that I have been speaking at this.
[55:06.000 --> 55:23.000]  These pro marijuana states rights conferences, which have been my speeches have been very well received, but a small hand of agitators ginned up by David Brock and the people that media matters for America have staged a boycott of 75 speakers expected
[55:23.000 --> 55:37.000]  in our three people dropped. Good riddance. That's right. They're pushing a no platforming for you, which means the end of free speech, which again, I have a stack of news here and a stack of clips where CNN, MSNBC, they're all saying it's time to end free speech.
[55:37.000 --> 55:50.000]  They're saying free speech is white supremacist. They even had the ACLU apologize and remove an image of a white child because they said that that was white supremacist because the ACLU said yes.
[55:50.000 --> 56:03.000]  The dumb dumb white supremacist have a right to march. So now the left is openly saying the ACLU are Nazis and the ACLU has apologized for showing a white baby in amongst other photos of children.
[56:03.000 --> 56:23.000]  Yeah, it's Kafka asked me really is Alice in Wonderland time in America. The left has gone completely insane over the fact that we have a million new jobs, that the stock market is reaching record levels and in middle America, let me assure you, people are very pleased with the performance of
[56:23.000 --> 56:31.000]  Donald Trump. Now what the president must do is take the fight to the Congress, attack the Democrats and the Republicans.
[56:31.000 --> 56:39.000]  Yes, they're always trying to intimidate him saying he won't be liked if he doesn't roll over and he's to stop tweeting and stop fighting. No, he needs to keep fighting.
[56:39.000 --> 56:47.000]  We're going to come back to 15 more minutes with Roger Stone. Then we've got Anthony Sabato Jr. running for Congress joining us. John Rappaport and more.
[56:47.000 --> 56:57.000]  Wow. We've got so much to get into here today. But just briefly, ladies and gentlemen, you make this broadcast possible. They are trying to shut us down seven ways this Sunday.
[56:57.000 --> 57:05.000]  They're coming after Stone. They're coming after me. They got a lot of folks rolling over and cowardice, even though we're winning. I'm never backing down. I'm never giving in.
[57:05.000 --> 57:13.000]  Now we had to end that big month and a half long special. We were running, but we've got a lot of other new great specials at infowarslife.com.
[57:13.000 --> 57:26.000]  You get free shipping on orders of $50 or more. So a lot of stuff becomes a lost leader, but we've never offered super male vitality at 57% off, even though it's one of our top three best sellers.
[57:26.000 --> 57:40.000]  And even though we only have probably a month supply of it, it may be December till more comes in. Super male vitality. The amazing concentrated herbs known for thousands of years to help vitality, stamina,

[58:07.000 --> 58:16.000]  We've got some deals on caveman as well. But again infowarslife.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[58:16.000 --> 58:23.000]  It is an act of resistance when you financially support us. Get the super blue fluoride free toothpaste for children and for adults.

[58:39.000 --> 58:49.000]  We will not give in. We are full steam ahead. Damn the maneuvers. We're going straight at them.
[58:49.000 --> 58:58.000]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information and in the last four or five years doing more and more research.
[58:58.000 --> 59:08.000]  I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors in many cases had much better nutrition than we do today.
[59:08.000 --> 59:14.000]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing and then processing.
[59:14.000 --> 59:28.000]  And so I set out to develop caveman, but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other super food ingredients known for cleansing and super charging the body at the same time.
[59:28.000 --> 59:38.000]  infowars isn't just fighting the globalist. We're getting results and we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault and winning because of your support.

[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:17.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:26.000]  We shot me, we shot Mike. Roger Stone is our guest. I mean look, we gave you the exclusive on the pardon.
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:30.000]  We gave you the exclusive on the Google droids watching and listening to you.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.000]  We gave you the exclusive on their plan to overthrow Trump using COG.
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:39.000]  We gave you the exclusive on they're going to say he's mentally ill next because we're not just thinking this stuff up.
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:44.000]  We have the sources and stuff. This is a short segment long segment coming up and you'll be gone.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:53.000]  How to go to your important meetings. What else is front and center on the radar? What does Trump need to do because it's clear and we'll get into this more in the next segment.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:01:06.000]  They are initiating the attempt to overthrow him now. They said it a month ago. They said the next two months to have it telegraphs their operatives that they have confidence that now launch the full assault.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:13.000]  Everyone I know in corporate inboxes from from Uber, you name it is, you know, Trump's a white supremacist, we must overthrow him.
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:22.000]  Nazis are everywhere, you know, get in their face. They're telling businesses from Starbucks to flower shops, ask people of their racist.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:32.000]  You've seen hysteria on the street where they try to attack you everywhere. I mean, they have activated their people into a type of in pecking, weird temper tantrum revolution.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:39.000]  I don't think it's going to go well. I mean, Hitler dropped bombs on England. It turned the people for the war from being against it.
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:49.000]  And I think these globalists and their minions are such cowards. They don't understand all this intimidation just gave me way more energy, made me commit to this absolute total resistance.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:56.000]  Alex, I don't think the people of middle America who support this president are going to stand for some kind of coup.
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:06.000]  Of course, the president has an obligation to restore order in the events that there is a mass insurrection against constitutional government.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:17.000]  The left is whip themselves into a frenzy because everything they have tried has failed. They were able to use Watergate to take Nixon out.
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:25.000]  They were able to murder John F. Kennedy when I say they, you know, the establishment, the deep state.
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:35.000]  I think Eisenhower called it the military industrial complex. None of their standard operating procedures are working with this president.
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:41.000]  And the reason for that is because we have a vibrant and robust alternative media.
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:47.000]  When people get sick of the lies on CNN, they can go to Info Wars to find out the truth.
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:03:02.000]  That's why the tech left is working overtime to try to censor us, to try to use the manipulation of our algorithms and a dozen other computer tricks to try to end our reach so that we can.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:17.000]  And let's be clear. Let's be clear. They're launching everything now. The censorship has gone up 500-fold, the physical attacks 500-fold, the bullying, the freaking out, the rhetoric with CIA high-level folks saying we're going to kill Trump on television.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:25.000]  They're canvassing Congress about who's going to go along with them, throwing them in a mental institution. I mean, this is happening.
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:37.000]  The single most important thing the president could do right now is to take the FISA court warrant that proves the mass-based illegal unconstitutional spying on at least 30,000 Americans
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:48.000]  and tell Jeff Sessions to bring an immediate criminal indictment against Brennan, Rogers, Jarrett, Rice, et al.
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:58.000]  That would cut right to the heart of the guts of the CIA. He's got to go on the offense. And we're seeing some signals with Sessions with the Awan Brothers indicted for espionage against the Republic.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:07.000]  The word is shulch. The indictments are ready. We're seeing other criminal investigations of the Clintons going to high gear. I think the president must move now for the Republic.
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:25.000]  You know the most fundamental and important of Stone's rules. You never win on defense. The president must go on offense against both parties in Congress, go on offense against the Deep State, and begin the prosecution of those who violated our civil liberties under Obama.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:40.000]  While he still has the backing of the military, because they're openly in the news shopping the military to go along with the coup, they're waiting to take his support away when they plunge the economy. He's got to move first so they can't blow the economy and complete the takeover of the country.
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:56.000]  The country has been invaded by globalist forces. These are alien outside forces. The president must move militarily. I believe outside of the courts. We cannot wait. Military action now.
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:12.000]  You deserve a deep restful sleep with knockout by InfoWarsLife. Our organic formula is made from high quality natural ingredients such as valerian root extract, L-tryptophan, lemon balm leaf extract, and melatonin.

[01:05:48.000 --> 01:06:08.000]  Head on over to infowarslife.com and say goodbye to fatigue. That's infowarslife.com.
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:32.000]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war. Pathogens added to the food and water and to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality, turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death.
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:47.000]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex. Anthroplex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:56.000]  However, why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today, it's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:33.000]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children, to the best job you can to purify your air. The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most toxic effects for themselves.
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000]  The general public doesn't.
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:50.000]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500. One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean. This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:08:06.000]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at infowarsstore.com.
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:28.000]  The coolest thing, the Alex Jones show, is the piss in the face of all that.
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:39.000]  But we'll see. You see, they're launching a new Comedy Central show five nights a week based on me, where a guy plays me and then says horrible racist stuff so people want to kill me on the street.
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:52.000]  What's come? We're going to play a trailer for that coming up. No, but Roger's doing an amazing job. You were getting into the serious stuff. Great job on the film. Get me Roger Stone. And I think it does deserve an Oscar. I can only watch documentaries these days and it is riveting.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:57.000]  So he's out there doing some important work and he's going to be spending a week a month with us here in the ATX.
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:09.000]  But finishing up, Roger, we have massive civil war. They're launching the admission that they're saying they think he's mentally ill, that they want to militarily overthrow him. You told TMZ when you got off the airplane yesterday in L.A.
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:17.000]  You said, look, we'll play the clip after you're gone. You said, look, I'm not for violence, but if they overthrow him, America's not putting up with it.
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:27.000]  It's not like where you punch us in the face like Antifa and then somebody fights back and you go, oh my God, you fought back against Antifa. They're the white knights that no one's allowed to fight back against.
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:38.000]  I mean, this is crazy how entitled they are. You can see them with the censorship, everything mounting, their campaigns for rioting, that they're building towards a crescendo and they admit they're building towards a crescendo to removing.
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:49.000]  What's your intel on how that may look? What you think is going to happen if they try it? I believe it's going to blow up spectacularly and take the Democratic Party from a dying coastal party to basically an outlawed party.
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:59.000]  Now, when I say Trump should use the military against these people, they're on TV saying, kill Trump. They're on TV saying, we're the CIA. We're going to kill him soon.
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:12.000]  We're organizing a coup outside of law. They've got Brennan and Clapper all saying it. So that's outside of law preparing a coup in America. You strike back against that with the national security apparatus.
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:21.000]  I'm not calling for the seven days in May. I'm calling to stop the seven days in May, literally. So what do you say in closing Roger Stone?
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:29.000]  Yeah, I think you have to remember, Alex, that the president is the head of government. He is not a candidate. He's the president of the United States.
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:40.000]  A move against him is therefore an illegal and unconstitutional move. He would have the right to order the military to put down mass insurrection in the country.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:54.000]  I believe most police officers in this country would remain loyal to the president. Again, we are not the ones advocating violence. We are not the ones who are rationalizing violence.
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:07.000]  We are anti-violence. What I told TMZ was, however, that if there is an illegitimate, unconstitutional move to remove this president, it's going to be met with violence from those in Middle America
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:15.000]  who no longer have to depend on CNN and CBS to find out what's going on, who can find out what's going on by coming right here to Info Wars,
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:24.000]  or go to Breitbart or Daily Call or any number of other places that will tell you the truth, and those people will be mobilized.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:34.000]  Of that, there is no doubt. In the next 24 hours, you're going to hear over and over again, Roger Stone advocated violence if Trump is impeached.
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:40.000]  Not what I said. Listen to the whole take. Not what I said.
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:48.000]  What's the next attack on him after that? Clearly, do you agree with me they're building towards the big event?
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:57.000]  There's no question. My sources like yours tell me that violence is the next event. They predicted this before Charlottesville.
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:06.000]  We now know that Charlottesville was a fraud, the guy who ran the entire operation, the top white supremacist.
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:13.000]  Well, it turns out that he was working for Hillary a year and a half ago, pardon me, for Obama a year and a half ago.
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:20.000]  So I think the fraud of Charlottesville has now been exposed. I expect Alex to answer your question directly.
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:30.000]  There will be more false flags. There will be more abject prop set up to foment violence and then blame that violence on Donald Trump.
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:37.000]  That's exactly what happened in Charlottesville, and I expect there will be other Charlottesvilles shortly.
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:44.000]  I expect Oklahoma City's federal building with a nursery again, blow it up, claim a Trump supporter did it, try to pin it on the president.
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:50.000]  None of us are going to buy that and we're ready for it and we know it. We knew that Soros was fighting the summer of rage.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:59.000]  They finally got their event. They've been calling for all this violence. They finally get some violence to then brand us for the coming civil war, which they have lit the fuse on.
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:05.000]  But the truth is we're here fighting it. Our listeners are fighting it and we're going to win and we have the beach out of the president now.
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:15.000]  The big enemy, as you said, is the Republican establishment with the Speaker of the House meeting with Democrats on TV saying he wants to work with them basically against Trump.
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:23.000]  They're all preparing with Mitch McConnell saying Trump may be removed the New York Times this weekend. They are clearly preparing the attack in the next month.
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:32.000]  This is the time for maximum vigilance and never hedging our bets, but being fully committed to the Republic and fully committed to this champion, Donald John Trump.
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:35.000]  Thank you so much, Roger Stone.
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:46.000]  Alex, great to be with you. And again, the most important takeaway today, and you're hearing it on Info Wars first, Jeff Zucker, the head of CNN will be out of work shortly.
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:14:02.000]  Folks at the highest levels of AT&T who are on the verge of acquiring Time Warner and thus CNN are very unhappy with the way CNN has become a front organization and no longer a news organization.
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:03.000]  Well said, my friend.
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:04.000]  Your first at Info Wars.
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:07.000]  All right, we'll talk to you soon. Thank you, Roger.
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:08.000]  Great, Alex. Thank you.
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:22.000]  I was hearing that a few weeks ago, too, about some meetings in DC and let's just say the best laid plans of mice and men often go astray.
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.000]  Let me start getting to some clips.
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:29.000]  Then I want to open the phones up to take your calls out of Antonio Sabato Jr. joining us and I want to have open phones for him.
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:34.000]  Smart guy, good looking guy, libertarian conservative patriot, and the numbers are showing.
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:40.000]  Looks like he can win in his run for Congress. So we really look forward to having him on coming up.
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:44.000]  He's been on before and now he's getting traction in the polls.
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:50.000]  He was on Fox News this morning, which is what what made me think have Alia go ahead and call him up and try to get him on.
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:54.000]  So he's going to be popping in to join us as well because that's the real victory here.
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:55.000]  Keep moving forward.
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:03.000]  Get real patriots elected to Congress, to governorships, to state houses, 900 plus patriots elected to state houses.
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000]  30 plus state houses now controlled by Republicans.
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:16.000]  The Liberty Movement is taking over the stinking evil old Republican Party that works with the evil white supremacist KKK Democratic Party.
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:21.000]  And their whole race baiting orgy is a symbol of their weakness.
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:29.000]  Again, I mean, I see CNN now and other publications and it is the headline, Bikers to Protest Trump.
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:33.000]  And I go, the bikers are for it. And I read it. It says the bikers there to protest him.
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:38.000]  And then I see them show crowds going, look at the bikers. They're against Trump because they had no crowd.
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:46.000]  So they pointed a camera at 200 yards at our crowd. I mean, that is incredible.
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:54.000]  They are telling lies now that are so big that that are just.
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:16:01.000]  Well, it's what Matt, one of the producers said, he goes, this is Hitler tactics.
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:05.000]  I mean, I think about how Schwarzenegger is lecturing Trump on how to not be a racist.
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:10.000]  The guy told Rolling Stone, he dreams of being Hitler.
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:18.000]  I'm not going to go into the whole thing about why he bought the rights to the movie, Pumping Iron, because they had, and we're going to put it on the DVD a decade ago,
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:26.000]  and made him pay exorbitantly to buy Pumping Iron because they, it was on the cutting room floor when he had talked about admiring Adolf Hitler and the master race.
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:33.000]  And they interviewed all these black bodybuilders. He'd walk in the gym and say, inwards, get out of here. Your God is here.
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:38.000]  And he was so racist and so hateful, he would make them cry.
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:46.000]  And then he'd take their girlfriends away from them and have sex with them in the gym in front of everybody.
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:50.000]  And I guess his bluff worked. He's like huge black guys. They'd back off. He threatened to kick their asses.
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:17:00.000]  He's completely insane. His father was an SS officer in the Gestapo and ran a major city in World War II.
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:05.000]  His brother, the big, the big guy who died in an automobile accident. I've read it all up on it.
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:12.000]  I made a documentary partially about Schwarzenegger, Marshall Lobb.
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:19.000]  His brother was a product of an SS marriage. Arnold was born, what, like last year of the war or whatever.
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:29.000]  The point is, is that ladies and gentlemen, you have a literal Nazi where it was in Rolling Stone that people come over to his house.
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:34.000]  He'd have Hitler speeches on the record player and would be in an SS uniform.
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:41.000]  He wore Nazi uniforms at the house for dinner parties.
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:46.000]  And I guess it gets people's attention. I mean, yeah, it's a real son of a real Nazi.
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:51.000]  Big, good-looking guy in a Nazi uniform with a German accent playing Hitler records.
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:55.000]  And the women were impressed, I guess. I mean, and he points his damn finger.
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:58.000]  Excuse me, listeners, I'm not trying to use those terms.
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:04.000]  He points his stinking, lily-livered finger at Donald Trump who's trying to turn this country around everything else
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:12.000]  and says he is a Nazi in that video he put out last week. That makes me sick.
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:18.000]  My family literally almost died. I almost don't exist because of Arnold Schwarzenegger's father and people like him.
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:25.000]  And then I've got to be lectured by this toad.
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:30.000]  I mean, I just can't handle it anymore.
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:36.000]  And then it gets worse because Arnold at least didn't round up Jews by the thousands.
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:41.000]  The godfather of the modern left, the guy that funds them, wasn't just a Nazi collaborator.
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:49.000]  He says he's proud of it and not sorry for it.
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:55.000]  George Soros, I mean, you cannot, and then George Soros is trying to destroy me 24x7 with massive money
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:19:00.000]  funding all these lies and all these private investigators and stuff.
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:05.000]  I mean, and just coming after me, after me, I mean, it's weird to have a weird Nazi after me.
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:10.000]  And he runs the Google Facebook censor board with Southern Barbie Law Center.
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:20.000]  He funds it. A weird Nazi censoring me and then I get Cuomo and his thug brother, Chris Cuomo on Trump rally.
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:31.000]  Nothing says fun like white supremacist and the headlines in the Washington Post and seeing in everyone who voted for Trump is a white supremacist.
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:35.000]  And it's just like, well, screw you.
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:41.000]  But they're like, oh, we don't care if you don't care, we're going to come after you and everybody else, including average citizens.
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:44.000]  You're not going to have leftists coming up to you poking you.
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:47.000]  Hey, hey, hey, bow down to me.
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:51.000]  You know what? They just woke up sleeping giant.
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:20:17.000]  I got so much energy. I'm ready to fight. I'm ready to win.

[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:21.000]  I'm going to open the phones up in the next segment to give your take on the Civil War that globalists have launched through their compliant leftist stuges.
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:28.000]  The situation with the escalation in the war, at least on paper in Afghanistan,
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:31.000]  they're announcing they're getting ready to make their move to try to overthrow the president.
[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:35.000]  How do you think that's going to go down? What do we do in response?
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:38.000]  I think the president has to move on them.
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:43.000]  And that makes me public enemy number one, but I'm willing to come out and say what this country needs.
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:48.000]  Remember, I'm the anti-police state guy. I'm the anti-coup guy.
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:52.000]  They are the ones with the police state. They are the ones with the coup.
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:25:01.000]  They are the ones openly announcing they want to kill the president and are planning to do it to legitimize it with their constituency.
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:07.000]  And to prepare them, like everybody's up at the edge of the cliff going, come on guys, let's jump. It's safe.
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:11.000]  So they jump off into the water and go, it's warm in here. Come on in. It's great.
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:17.000]  There's not piranhas in here or anything, as I swim by, as you swim by,
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:25.000]  as if we are going to put up with any of this, as if they have the moral authority,
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:33.000]  as if they have any military bearing or history, as if they have any physicality or any business acumen
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:39.000]  or any true gravitas when it comes to being aggressive in the real sense,
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:46.000]  because if they start a civil war, they plan to mop everybody up, shut down the red states forever,
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:50.000]  and basically create a one-party system. That's their stated goal.
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:55.000]  Have new fake elections overseen by them. It's basically the Venezuelan model.
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:26:03.000]  A permanent one-party state with a kind of vestigial Republican party that are lap dogs and plays along.
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:09.000]  The coup supporters at least think they're going to have a place in the new system.
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:14.000]  And because they know we reach tens of millions of people every day now, they're censoring us, they're blocking us,
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:21.000]  they're trying to boycott us, they're trying to shut us down, and they're having two shows on HBO,
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:32.000]  one show on Showtime, multiple shows on Netflix, every major cable comedy show,
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:39.000]  saying that Alex Jones is an evil bad person who needs to be taken off the air,
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:48.000]  and now they're launching comedy-central program where five nights a week.
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:52.000]  I'll tell you about this in the next segment.
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:56.000]  They have someone playing the part, quote, of Alex Jones.
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:04.000]  This is a new Stephen Colbert thing, and it's an actor reading on a teleprompter who then will make nonsensical arguments,
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:12.000]  and they admit it's supposed to be an Alex Jones approach to satire.
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:20.000]  And then when I go out on the street in Austin, Texas, where the failures of LA and other places have moved,
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:23.000]  they don't think, gee, we moved here because we collapsed to their areas of the country.
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:27.000]  They see me walking down the street, and they come over and go, F you and want to beat me up,
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:31.000]  and I ask them why, and they reprieve something they heard on Stephen Colbert,
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:34.000]  and I look at them and I go, dude, that's not real.
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:39.000]  And they go, shut up, fake news, fact check.
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:46.000]  What do you say for Charlotte? And I say, well, today, 13 people got run over and killed and hundreds injured.
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:52.000]  Shut up, that didn't happen, you're fake.
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:59.000]  And I look at the guy and I say, that's not fake, it's on video. It was a live feed. You saw it.
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:04.000]  They walk over saying F you, and a few of them would actually talk to me.
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:08.000]  It was usually the gay guys. They'd laugh at me and say, okay, I'll talk to you.
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:13.000]  They'd walk over all sassy pants doing like this, and, oh, yeah, really? Oh, sure, that never happened.
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:18.000]  That's fake news. The guy's boyfriend goes, well, actually, that did happen in Barcelona today.
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:22.000]  He's like, oh, that didn't matter, you're still fake.
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:28.000]  They don't believe anything I say, despite the fact I keep telling you everything that's going to happen,
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:32.000]  and it happens just basically exactly as we said.
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:38.000]  And that's not hard to do when you're tuned in to the real world already.
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:45.000]  But see, the establishment thinks you're so dumb, they put out, you're a racist, you're a Nazi, you're a fascist,
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:51.000]  and it's okay to punch a Nazi, it's okay to get rid of their free speech, and then, by extension,
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:58.000]  project on to everyone else that they are Nazis.
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:02.000]  I was wearing my wedding ring today because I never wear it, and believe it or not,
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:06.000]  I've lost so much weight since about four or five years ago when I was wearing it last, so I'm remarried,
[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:10.000]  that it's just too loose, it's coming off, I can't wear it.
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:16.000]  It keeps distracting me. I have to get a new wedding ring, I guess, or I guess get it filled, make it smaller.
[01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:22.000]  That's just a fact. That wasn't a stunt for the products we sell to show how I've lost 40, 50 pounds the last few years.
[01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:30.000]  I still got a really big head, though, but I have lost 90% of my prodigious gut I had before,
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:36.000]  but I've gotten so focused on work, I've basically stopped working out now, so I'm wondering how soon do I start gaining weight again,
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:41.000]  but the products are so good, the X2, the Superman and the rest of it, that are on sale by the way right now,
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:44.000]  that I just basically quit working out. It's not good.
[01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:52.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:32:52.000 --> 01:33:18.000]  and support the info war while you support Healthy Gums and Teeth.
[01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:28.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:46.000]  They want to destroy the opposition to their offshore global takeover. They have to create strong men and then have those fictitious actors pose as news reporters who then misrepresent what their opposition says and does.
[01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:57.000]  And that's what they're doing. Wartime level propaganda being directed at yours truly and President Trump like we're foreign powers, but we're not.
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:10.000]  We're just representatives of the people that are trying to get our country back from the clutches of the institutions that have hijacked our nation and that are exploiting the people and who have broken the social compact.
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:19.000]  Now, I guess launching next week, the new show, I can't even watch all these shows attacking me. I can't even keep track of it.
[01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:25.000]  Why Jordan Kepler's Alex Jones approach to conspiracy satire is a tricky prospect.
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:45.000]  Why is it a tricky prospect because they're worried about how to dumb it down enough that their audience can even understand it without sending us more listeners.
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:58.000]  But nevertheless, they're going to try the new approach. It's like the show Homeland where the evil character is based on Alex Jones and he produces fake news and it shows the proof and he's a racist.
[01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:14.000]  And so then people that watch that are so mentally ill, so suggestible that when they see me on the street, they actually believe that I'm that person.
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:19.000]  I don't think we can reach these people, folks, and now they're going to project it on you.
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:23.000]  Now they're going to come up and ask you on the street, CNN's announcing this, are you for Trump?
[01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:28.000]  And if you are, they're going to punch you in the nose or they're going to kick you out of your apartment or they're not going to do business with you.
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:33.000]  Well, good then. Let's just separate from these people. Start doing what they do.
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:43.000]  Look into everybody they do business with and then don't support them when they do this, no platforming to others and see how long these parasites last.
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:48.000]  Because they're not going to stop. You give into their bullying now by successive approximation.
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:52.000]  They're going to keep pushing it for ever.
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:36:01.000]  So here's a first look at Jordan Kepler stealing my identity and then misrepresenting who I am.
[01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:04.000]  It's like stealing someone's identity and you kind of look like them.
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:10.000]  You act like them in the real world and then you end up getting busted and going to jail.
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:15.000]  You know, that happens sometimes. People get their identity stolen. Folks write a bunch of checks or whatever until the police figure it out later.
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:21.000]  Sometimes never you go to prison for what they did. But here he is publicly stealing my identity.
[01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:28.000]  Then he misrepresents who I am. Maybe they'll give him an Emmy.
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000]  Just like they misrepresent.
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:41.000]  I'm Donald Trump. I don't like black people. But I do like Alex Jones. Alex Jones taught me how to not like black people.
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:46.000]  Then people started sending me emails and comments calling that's Alex Jones. He's the racist.
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:52.000]  Then you have Tom Brokaw. Doesn't show a clip of me being racist. He just says branding. Alex Jones is racist.
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:57.000]  Talking to you like you're a three year old. And the talking points go out.
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:01.000]  And then the New York Times has editorial board meetings and they go, this Russia thing is going to peter out.
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:07.000]  What's coming up next? Well, as we move towards the next election, they may remove them before then, we're going to say he's mentally ill.
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:11.000]  That's the talking points we've been ordered to go with by the folks in psych warfare.
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:18.000]  We're also going to expand onto just basic fraud probes and bring back the racism stuff.
[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:24.000]  And then Stone gets the intel. We give you the intel and sure enough, that's what they do.
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:32.000]  Again, think of the magnitude of this. Here is the Comedy Central clip of the man that's stolen my identity.
[01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:37.000]  I tested couch soldiers. They're lying to you. The mainstream establishment is poison your mind.
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:43.000]  They say we should investigate Trump. I say impeach Hillary. They say global warming is made by man.
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:49.000]  I say, it's probably why we earned 30 cents more on the dollar. They say our children should learn Chinese.
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:55.000]  I say, China isn't real. No one I know has, like, ever been there. And I know, like, a ton of people.
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:38:00.000]  Who are they? The enemy. Who's the enemy? They are. I already said that. Pay attention.
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:07.000]  It's time for us to fight back against them because them are fighting against we.
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:10.000]  I'm Jordan Klepper and this is The Opposition.
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:16.000]  The Opposition, Jordan Klepper, weeknights after the Daily Show, premieres September 25th on Comedy Central.
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:20.000]  Progress, you'll have to go through us first.
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:24.000]  And what they're really saying is marching orders. You're going to have to go through us.
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:30.000]  He's out there saying, you got to go through me. And then he'll explain how he politically operates.
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:36.000]  He's really telling them how to operate, not the way we operate. And then he all says it very disingenuously.
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:43.000]  So they're there getting their programming on how to attack us while they're learning to hate us,
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:48.000]  but really they're discovering their identity. This is mind control.
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:55.000]  And it is meant to just send them out savagely believing there's some war room battling against them
[01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:59.000]  when all we're doing is looking at victims who are mind controlled.
[01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:03.000]  Oh, and China. Notice Lloyd Blank find again, put up those tweets months ago saying,
[01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:12.000]  you'll never rebuild America. China is much more powerful and we're moving all of our infrastructure there.
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:16.000]  And it's the same thing. They're signaling we're with China.
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:20.000]  I bet China paid for that. China is buying up most of Hollywood.
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:25.000]  China admittedly spends product placement in movies just like you can pay to have your product in a movie
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:30.000]  to have, oh, the Martian, we couldn't get to Mars to save Matt Damon,
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:36.000]  but the Chinese boosters are better than ours. They got our boosters or we use Russian boosters.
[01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:43.000]  Or, oh, the Chinese save us in, you know, the new movie that came out about the arrival.
[01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:49.000]  Every show, every movie that science fiction or news based Hollywood is admittedly being,
[01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:55.000]  there it is, Daily Mail, from Hollywood to Chollywood, the sinister Chinese takeover of movie land.
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:40:01.000]  Boom! Oh, but type in seven, eight years ago when I first said China is taking over Hollywood,
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:09.000]  the Jew haters went completely apoplectic, completely just almost in a fetal position,
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:17.000]  going, no, no, no, no, no, it's a fact. And I told you first because I was out in Hollywood talking to people.
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:27.000]  China would, and that's why you see Comedy Central with the Chinese flag projected over him big and powerful.
[01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:36.000]  And in Chinese iconography, that's a disrespect. It projects, like hitting with a shoe, the big China over him.
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:43.000]  And he's the ignorant American that didn't worry about China. You got blank fine, you got globalist, you got Kissinger.
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:48.000]  They've all moved over there, they've all got their industry there, they all leverage the solid of America there.
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:58.000]  China's got 98% of rare earth minerals because as a policy, we're meant to be deindustrialized.
[01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:09.000]  They're given all the deep water ports. And then the globalists only use the U.S. military to keep the Chinese Communist in check
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:17.000]  to make sure they can still have one-sided business deals and extract as much slave labor out of the poor, hardworking Chinese people as they can.
[01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:25.000]  And that's the deciphered true intellectual historical breakdown of a show like that, not him up there making nonsensical statements
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:31.000]  and then projecting it that Alex Jones said it.
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:39.000]  You listen to stuff he says, I don't say any of that. Other than we have multinational, very exploitive, neoliberal,
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:48.000]  corporatist forces that want to drive our economies into the dirt so they can consolidate control and want a renter economy
[01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:54.000]  where almost everybody lives in little tiny dwellings and they're banning family homes all over Europe
[01:41:54.000 --> 01:42:04.000]  and starting it here and banning fire stoves and banning any natural human organic in the fields operation to fully and totally domesticate everyone.
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:14.000]  This is a red-level emergency. This isn't bipartisan. This is human.
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:22.000]  But again, they're using super psychological warfare where first they get well-meaning people to go, we shouldn't be racist.
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:26.000]  And folks are like, yeah, and actually you should not use a word like this as racist.
[01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:30.000]  Next, you should do this more in your life to prove you're not racist and to repay for it.
[01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:36.000]  And once they get them in that mindset, they go, you see the ACLU, they tweeted a picture of a little boy or girl,
[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:43.000]  you can't tell, a two-year-old blonde-haired baby with an American flag and it triggered everybody.
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:47.000]  Actually, go to the tweet, you can see the full American flag, the full photo.
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:53.000]  And it was so triggering that, and the left universally said it's racist, it's evil, take it down,
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:43:01.000]  the ACLU then apologized and said, you're right, you're right, it's racist, we apologize.
[01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:05.000]  Think of the cult-level control.
[01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:14.000]  And that takes me to Chris Cuomo on Trump, nothing says fun like white supremacist.
[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:19.000]  And then white supremacist by default, how ordinary people made Charlottesville possible, CNN,
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:27.000]  tell them in the transcript, go out and get in ordinary people's faces, especially white people, they're bad.
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:34.000]  I mean, just a peer pressure orgy, a peer pressure gang assault.
[01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:37.000]  Let's play the clip, here it is.
[01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:45.000]  Surprise, he's blasting the media for criticizing his or even pointing out his wildly different tone in speeches.
[01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:50.000]  He's writing the fake news, he's now complaining about my different types of back-to-back speeches.
[01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:56.000]  Well, there was Afghanistan, somber, the big rally, enthusiastic, dynamic and fun.
[01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:59.000]  Because nothing says fun like white supremacist.
[01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:04.000]  And the American Legion, VA, respectful and strong.
[01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:08.000]  Too bad the Dems have no one who can change tones.
[01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:15.000]  Notice the condescension, oh look, surprise, he tweeted again.
[01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:18.000]  For a year and a half they've been saying you shouldn't be allowed to tweet,
[01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:23.000]  but they tweet constantly, all the other politicians do.
[01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:28.000]  So first they ingrain it in their people's heads that tweeting is losing, when it's winning.
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:32.000]  And they go, oh look, we had another victory, he tweeted back.
[01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:37.000]  There's nothing more uncool than someone's speech, or a president directly talking to you.
[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:43.000]  He's almost as bad as that Franklin Delano Roosevelt guy, another cook, another bad guy.
[01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:48.000]  And then white supremacist.
[01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:52.000]  And it just, it's like parrots, mind-controlled parrots.
[01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000]  And it's not working.
[01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:58.000]  So now they're saying, well, let's just kill him on the same channel.
[01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:05.000]  And I'm saying a group of people want to kill the president and overtake the government.
[01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:11.000]  And then bully all of us in the line and have forced reeducation in the public schools.
[01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:14.000]  And Obama even had it on the books for reeducation camps for conservatives.
[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000]  I mean, they called them reeducation camps.
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:21.000]  You know, I got an idea for you guys.
[01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:29.000]  You push your big fat, globalist mouths a lot, when 99.9% of you couldn't fight it way out of a wet paper bag,
[01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:36.000]  you better hope to your lucky stars, you don't get your way and start a physical war in this country.
[01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:39.000]  Because you've been asking for it for a long time.
[01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:42.000]  And you can blow up federal buildings all day and try to blame it on us.
[01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:45.000]  You know, find a kindergartner or whatever, like Clinton's got caught doing.
[01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:50.000]  But when people actually come after you, they're not going to be going after kindergartens.
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:58.000]  There won't be one of you traders, one of you collaborators that could, you want to intimidate us to not walk on the street?
[01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:06.000]  You're not going to be able to go to sleep at night without knowing of the crimes you've committed.
[01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000]  So you want to play in a big man's game.
[01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:09.000]  Ooh, big war.
[01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:10.000]  Don't kill people.
[01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000]  Put folks in reeducation camps.
[01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:13.000]  Gonna bully everybody.
[01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:14.000]  Gonna bankrupt everybody.
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000]  Gonna teach everybody.
[01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:20.000]  That's what this is, is an authoritarian attempt to take America down.
[01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000]  The socialists have done it everywhere else.
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000]  The communists and men, they want it here now.
[01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:27.000]  And they are using the fact that we coexist with them to do it.
[01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:30.000]  It's time to stop caring what they think.
[01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:35.000]  It's time to stop bowing down to them and to recognize what trash they are.
[01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:38.000]  But as for me, I'm nonviolent.
[01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:42.000]  I'm here just pointing out what evil you are.
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:48.000]  Here is a CNN white supremacist by default, anyone who voted for Trump.
[01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:54.000]  And when you read the transcript, it says, blame President Trump for his tepid mortal response.
[01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:57.000]  Call the neo-Nazis and white national stugs.
[01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:00.000]  Fill your Facebook and Twitter accounts with moral outrage.
[01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:04.000]  You should add, while Facebook, Twitter and Google block all the libertarians and conservatives,
[01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000]  simply countering back with logic.
[01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:14.000]  While the big corporations help us bully people.
[01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:17.000]  And they go on to say, but it's ordinary people.
[01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:22.000]  The voters who elected the reality TV star, they're the ones who are.
[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000]  They're blind.
[01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:28.000]  So let's go ahead and go to that club.
[01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:35.000]  To members of a movement steeped in symbolism, coded messages and belief in secret support for their cause.
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:41.000]  The president's initial response to Charlottesville and violence on many sides, on many sides,
[01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:44.000]  was a sign the president had their backs.
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:48.000]  He didn't attack us, wrote Andrew Englund, the creator of a neo-Nazi website.
[01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:55.000]  Other white nationalist posts included, he left the door open and clearly said, we are all equal under the law.
[01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000]  Racism is evil.
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:03.000]  Monday, when President Trump finally branded members of the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists
[01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:10.000]  and other hate groups who take part in violence as criminals and thugs, the alt-right viewed that as a double meaning.
[01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:17.000]  So was the president's second response, the delayed response, one that you believe he was pressured into
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000]  and doesn't believe?
[01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000]  He was clearly pressured into it.
[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:25.000]  Now, I don't think Donald Trump is an advocate for white people.
[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:31.000]  I think he probably is entirely sincere when he says neo-Nazis, white supremacists, whoever those people are,
[01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000]  are very bad and evil and go away.
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000]  I think he entirely believes that.
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:38.000]  But his first statement was much more accurate and even-handed.
[01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:44.000]  Jared Taylor is editor of what he calls a white advocacy website called American Renaissance.
[01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:50.000]  He tries to be a soft-spoken voice in what most Americans call a hate movement.
[01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:58.000]  The Southern Poverty Law Center says Taylor's group is racist with ideas that most would describe as crudely white supremacists.
[01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:01.000]  Taylor calls himself a white advocate.
[01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000]  What is a white advocate?
[01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:08.000]  A white advocate is someone who speaks up for the legitimate interests of white people.
[01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:14.000]  White advocates just want to be left alone. They would rather have a nation which was overwhelmingly white.
[01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:19.000]  And Taylor says the president understands this even if the press does not.
[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:27.000]  It's why Taylor backed Trump during the presidential primary campaign, producing racially charged robo-calls like this
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:30.000]  that then candidate Trump eventually had to denounce.
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:34.000]  We don't need Muslims. We need smart, well-educated white people.
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:37.000]  I am a farmer and white nationalist. Support Donald Trump.
[01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:41.000]  This week, Donald Trump took a page from white nationalist talking points.
[01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:49.000]  I interviewed Jared Taylor Tuesday afternoon, two hours before President Trump's news conference in New York.
[01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:54.000]  The answer is so similar. It's almost as if the president was listening in.
[01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:55.000]  Two p.m.
[01:49:55.000 --> 01:50:03.000]  And there would have been no violence whatsoever if there had not been counter protesters showing up with baseball bats and helmets and masks.
[01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:17.000]  Back this up, as if two hours later, the president heard this guy say this in a taped interview, you can see, and then copied it.
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:22.000]  It's common sense. It's a war on common sense.
[01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:27.000]  They want to define that Antifa can come beat you up and start a fight because you're Nazis.
[01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:34.000]  Well, soon it's conservatives libertarians. In fact, it's already here. They won't let Milo speak or enculturate Berkeley.
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:39.000]  And they're announcing that they're going to not let an anti-communist march take place out in California, the Antifa.
[01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:45.000]  So that's what this is. They show up, they start the fight, and then they're supposed to be decried too.
[01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:52.000]  That's the whole point. Then they act like that common sense statement came from this white nationalist they went to interview.
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:55.000]  I mean, talk about conspiracy theories.
[01:50:55.000 --> 01:51:03.000]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:13.000]  But the symptoms are there. Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:19.000]  Here, how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:23.000]  My blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:27.000]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:54.000]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[01:53:53.000 --> 01:54:05.000]  The preacher man says it's the end of time, and the Mississippi River, she's a gold grime.
[01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:15.000]  Now the show's here back live. So I'm playing this clip from CNN, and they're talking to some white nationalists.
[01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:25.000]  And they're saying because Trump said it takes two to tango that he must have heard that from them.
[01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:33.000]  Everybody always says if two groups come together and are attacking each other, you know, both sides are idiots.
[01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:40.000]  That is a default statement.
[01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:47.000]  But CNN says no, that means Trump, who came out and gave a speech two hours later, he must have seen our interview with this guy.
[01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:52.000]  But you can see it's a taped interview.
[01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:59.000]  It's just total insanity to again deceive their viewers, but this is the same CNN that told you along with other publications
[01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:07.000]  that the bikers were there in Phoenix two nights ago to protest Trump. This is how dumb they think all of us are.
[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:12.000]  And then by extension, they're saying all Trump supporters are white supremacists.
[01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:15.000]  It says that in the text of the article by showing this guy.
[01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:22.000]  When you've got all these Hispanic and black racist groups saying they want their own countries and they hate, you know, white people,
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:28.000]  and then, oh, but they love Hillary. Do they go again, oh, look at Mecha, look at La Raza, look at the new Black Panther Party.
[01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:37.000]  Look, they all support Hillary. So every Hillary supporter is a Chicano nationalist or a black nationalist or whatever.
[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:42.000]  Because conservatives don't do that. Libertarians don't play those games. That's disingenuous.
[01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:50.000]  But now the Democratic Party saying ACLU, you take down a picture of a white child from your website, it's racist.
[01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:55.000]  It's becoming that. It's so crazy. I can't even believe they've slipped this far.
[01:55:55.000 --> 01:56:01.000]  But let's go back to them trying to, again, equate that the guy saying, you know, it takes two sides.
[01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:07.000]  Well, it's beyond that. They sent the antifa to cause it. It doesn't mean I like the white supremacists,
[01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:12.000]  but separately they came to start the trouble. They're a horrible group of anti-free speech thugs.
[01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:19.000]  I put on the level or worse than the Nazis because I don't see Nazis running around stopping free speech everywhere now. See?
[01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:26.000]  Oh my gosh, that's even more insensitive. You love Nazis. No, I don't. It's reality.
[01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:33.000]  That's so anti-white, so racist, so bigoted to have the ACLU apologize for having a two-year-old white baby
[01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:38.000]  on a page of their website with an American flag that made people get triggered.
[01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:43.000]  They said, you're right. You've taught us. Thank you. We'll take it. We'll put out a tweet.
[01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:50.000]  We can show their response. It's in our article by Steve Watson on newswars.com and infowars.com. But here's more of the CNN piece.
[01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:58.000]  And there would have been no violence whatsoever if there had not been counter-protesters showing up with baseball bats and helmets and masks.
[01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000]  Mr. Trump, two hours later.
[01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:06.000]  Let me ask you this. What about the fact that they came charging with clubs in their hands swinging clubs?
[01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:09.000]  Do they have any problem? I think they do.
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:14.000]  Two p.m. If those folks hadn't showed up, there would have been no violence.
[01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:15.000]  Two p.m.
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:23.000]  I believe they are much more hate-motivated than the people who wanted to gather and talk about preserving the least statue and preserving a white majority.
[01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000]  Many different four p.m.
[01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:32.000]  But not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me. Not all of those people were white supremacists by any stretch.
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:40.000]  Those people were also there because they wanted to protest the taking down of a statue, Robert E. Lee.
[01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:41.000]  Then this.
[01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:47.000]  When are we going to rename the capital city? Washington, D.C. He was a slave owner.
[01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:51.000]  When are we going to write out of history the first seven of nine presidents?
[01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:54.000]  And then Trump mentions Washington too.
[01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:55.000]  Are they all going to come to us?
[01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:56.000]  Because it's common sense.
[01:57:56.000 --> 01:58:00.000]  George Washington was a slave owner. Was George Washington a slave owner?
[01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000]  Right there.
[01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:10.000]  It's total logic when the left already says take down Thomas Jefferson and George Washington and Al Sharpton had already called for it.
[01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000]  That Trump's going to say that.
[01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:15.000]  And the white nationalist guy has that point.
[01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000]  I mean, take it all down.
[01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:18.000]  The American flag.
[01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000]  Hell, they're hitting the flag in the world.
[01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:21.000]  They didn't have some slavery under it.
[01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:24.000]  That's how the whole Bible.
[01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:34.000]  The Israelites used to have slaves. The Muslims still have them. I mean, it's just total mental illness because people have a lack of historical understanding.

[02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:19.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide.
[02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:24.000]  I am your host, Alex Jones. Infowars.com is the website.
[02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:27.000]  You know, I said I was going to put the phones up and I'm a bad boy. I didn't do that.
[02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:31.000]  But Antonio Sabato Jr. is going to be joining us for 30 minutes.
[02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:37.000]  After that, I'll take 30 minutes of calls on any of the issues that we've raised here and we've talked about.
[02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:40.000]  But here is the main takeaway.
[02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:47.000]  The globalists are moving towards a civil war. They admit they're doing that and it's going to be a race war.
[02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:57.000]  And it's going to be a bunch of weird white people basically running it, fomenting it, henpecking it, asking people where they stand,
[02:00:57.000 --> 02:01:00.000]  not doing business with people that don't declare they love Hillary.
[02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000]  It just goes on and on.
[02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:07.000]  So since we're talking about this in a short segment, before I come back into all this other news,
[02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:15.000]  I wanted to play a clip here of a joke video I did yesterday because you talk about annoying sounding.
[02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:23.000]  Hillary Clinton and her new book on tape talk about the most grating voice.
[02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:27.000]  Why aren't I 60 points ahead, huh?
[02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:30.000]  It's incredible.
[02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:41.000]  So I put out this new video that talks about Hillary Clinton's secret phobia discovered because she's saying that Trump is so incredibly creepy
[02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000]  and made her skin crawl.
[02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:48.000]  And so we discovered that Trump found out her phobia. Here it is.
[02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:54.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've got shocking exclusive footage for you of Hillary Clinton.
[02:01:54.000 --> 02:02:04.000]  She came out today. We're going to show you a clip and said that in the debates, Trump made her skin crawl.
[02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:09.000]  He was literally breathing down my neck. My skin crawled.
[02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:13.000]  Now remember, this is a lady that's funded wars the year of spring.
[02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:19.000]  This is a lady who represented pedophiles who stole the money from Haitian children.
[02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:22.000]  But why did she say her skin crawled?
[02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:26.000]  Because she has a serious phobia.
[02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:29.000]  It's quite common.
[02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:37.000]  She did not like Donald Trump and one of the press centers early on watching her eat.
[02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:42.000]  That's Hillary's big phobia is that if you see her eating, it makes her skin crawl.
[02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:55.000]  So here's a clip of Hillary right now.
[02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:58.000]  You like that?
[02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:06.000]  If the Russians could act my subconscious.
[02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:14.000]  We came, we saw, we died.
[02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:20.000]  Can we see Hillary having lunch one more time, please?
[02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:23.000]  Can we back that up a little bit?
[02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:27.000]  Now granted, she's only been taped eating once. This was when she was a little bit younger.
[02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:35.000]  But if you're a radio listener, the name of the video is Hillary's new book reveals her secret phobia.
[02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:39.000]  But let's just play, maybe in slow motion if we could.
[02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:42.000]  Hillary Clinton enjoying a meal.
[02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:45.000]  Here is the footage.
[02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:50.000]  Ah, delicious.
[02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:56.000]  Oh yeah, spirit cooking.
[02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000]  Oh man, umma.
[02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:03.000]  Is that umma actually?
[02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000]  I gotta have some fun around here.
[02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:09.000]  I thought of that.
[02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000]  These people.
[02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:16.000]  There's no end to this authoritarianism and the mental illness of the one who run everybody's lives.
[02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:20.000]  I don't even want to run my own life hardly. I just get so tired of them.
[02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:26.000]  All right, 800-25-99231, 800-25-99231.
[02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:32.000]  Your calls are coming up as we do two segments of interviews with a man running for Congress, Antonio Sabato Jr.
[02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000]  Famous actor.
[02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:40.000]  A lot of big projects going, putting an all-in-the-line to be persecuted to support Trump during the campaign
[02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:44.000]  and beyond, now running for Congress.
[02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:50.000]  That is very, very exciting, running for the 26th District Congressional seat in California.
[02:04:50.000 --> 02:05:13.000]  Stay with us.
[02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:25.000]  I did dust the idea some old dead white guys dreamed up in fear of the Redcoats.
[02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:30.000]  No, it is just as essential to liberty today as it was in 1776.
[02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:38.000]  The original amendments we refer to as the Bill of Rights contain ten of what the constitutional framers termed unalienable rights.
[02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000]  The Bill of Rights came to us with blinders on.
[02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:43.000]  It doesn't recognize color or class or wealth.
[02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:50.000]  It protects not just the rights of actors or editors or reporters, but extends even to those we love to hate.
[02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000]  This is a small excerpt from Charlton Heston.
[02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:59.000]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing
[02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:03.000]  to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:08.000]  That's why I'm introducing Z Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:15.000]  It's made in the USA, it's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body
[02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:16.000]  and it supports the info war.
[02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000]  It is a classical 360-win.
[02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:22.000]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year
[02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:28.000]  and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:33.000]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this country and the world
[02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:38.000]  that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be
[02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:43.000]  because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the next level
[02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.000]  and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:48.000]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[02:06:48.000 --> 02:07:17.000]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z Shield at infowarslife.com.

[02:07:53.000 --> 02:08:16.000]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:25.000]  This morning I was working out and I had Fox News on analyzing it and seeing how more and more they're going against the president, more and more not supporting him.
[02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:31.000]  So it gets rarer and rarer to see a nice shining face on there, actually pointing out some common sense.
[02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:39.000]  But the hosts of that program were Antonio Sabato Jr., famous actor, you name it, the guy that early on was supporting Trump,
[02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:46.000]  is running for Congress, the 26th district of California against the horrible person I won't mention.
[02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:52.000]  And it was just great to see him up there and I was like, wow, that guy came on a few months ago, I'm already a fan of his work.
[02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:58.000]  And then I did a little bit of Googling and found out that he's doing pretty good in the polls, raising some money, there's a lot of excitement.
[02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:04.000]  I mean, if we can't elect this guy, I mean, he could be our next Ronald Reagan down the road, we can't elect anybody.
[02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:15.000]  The problem is, they are running around like chickens on PCP with their heads halfway cut off, just screaming white supremacist, white supremacist, white supremacist.
[02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:23.000]  The ACLU apologized for tweeting an image of a white baby with an American flag and then they said, we're sorry, it is racist.
[02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:27.000]  And people talked about wanting to kill the baby because it's white.
[02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:34.000]  I never even heard the KKK dirt balls talk like that, and here's CNN, ordinary people made Charlottesville possible.
[02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:46.000]  We're not hearing anything about the hundreds run over by Islamists or something like 30-something people stabbed to death in Russia and Germany and France and Belgium and Spain the last week.
[02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:51.000]  I mean, just the back of the paper, oh, seven stabbed here, nine stabbed here, three stabbed there.
[02:09:51.000 --> 02:10:00.000]  But don't worry ACLU, when your Twitter followers educate you, it's time to say thank you to them for letting you know that you were being racist.
[02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:01.000]  Let's put that back up.
[02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:09.000]  When your Twitter followers keep you in check and remind you that white supremacy is everywhere, then it has Kermit the Frog saying, thank you.
[02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:10.000]  That's a very good point.
[02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:11.000]  I'm not kidding.
[02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:14.000]  If you're a radio listener, you've got to go see it for yourself.
[02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000]  We've retweeted it at real Alex Jones.
[02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:24.000]  So you know how the Democrats with CIA people like Phil Mudd saying, we're getting ready to kill the president.
[02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:28.000]  We're getting ready to have a civil war and or he's mentally ill.
[02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000]  He's got early onset of dementia.
[02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:35.000]  We told you three months ago that we had folks inside a major newspaper editorial meeting.
[02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:41.000]  We had a source and they said, no, that that was the next thing to come right before they try to overthrow him.
[02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:42.000]  So here's the deal.
[02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:47.000]  They're not going to let us have this political realignment towards Americana libertarianism without a death fight.
[02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:53.000]  The Democrats are becoming an extinct party because of Nancy Pelosi, because of all these out of touch, senile people.
[02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000]  You talk about dementia.
[02:10:55.000 --> 02:11:01.000]  She said like 20 something times that I've seen personally that George W. Bush is still the president.
[02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:10.000]  And then she goes, I mean, the same press conference Maxine Waters goes, that Putin and Trump have just attacked Korea.
[02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000]  Everyone's like, ma'am, that's not true.
[02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:13.000]  She's like, yes, he did.
[02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:16.000]  I mean, these people don't know what planet they're on.
[02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:22.000]  So to have a smart, entrepreneurial, hardworking guy who's got courage to back Trump.
[02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000]  I was out on the streets of Seattle.
[02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:29.000]  They were physically attacking me last week screaming Nazi, Nazi, Nazi.
[02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:32.000]  I mean, just the craziest moronville.
[02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:39.000]  But the answer is America's faced tyrants and bullies before and we're going to stand against these folks without violence with unity.
[02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:46.000]  As Martin Luther King said, not what color your skin is, but what the content of your deeds are.
[02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000]  And that's exactly what this is about.
[02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:53.000]  We're going to go back to the real unity that America helps spread around the world of Martin Luther King and others.
[02:11:53.000 --> 02:12:00.000]  Not the false one, but I want to ask just the waterfront how he thinks Trump's doing, where he thinks this is going, how the congressional run is going.
[02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:08.000]  Antonio Sabato Jr. Vote Antonio dot com Facebook dot com forward slash Antonio Sabato Jr. Live.
[02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:11.000]  I got to ask him to has even censored yet on Twitter and Facebook.
[02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:14.000]  They are really trying to block anybody that doesn't hate America.
[02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000]  So thank you for joining us.
[02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000]  Thank you, Alex. How you doing, buddy?
[02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:19.000]  It's good to be back.
[02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:20.000]  Just the waterfront.
[02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000]  You heard my last four minute rant.
[02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:23.000]  What do you want to tackle first?
[02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:28.000]  I mean, how's it been for you running for Congress since you announced?
[02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.000]  Well, I've been running really good.
[02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:31.000]  I've been talking to all the folks out here.
[02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:35.000]  I've been to our county, my community from the police officers who I adore.
[02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:40.000]  I respect our firefighters, teachers, a Latino community.
[02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:41.000]  They're all supporting me.
[02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:46.000]  We're going to win big because we have to win big for our state of California for our country.
[02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000]  We are losing our country every single day.
[02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:55.000]  The Democratic Party, which by the way is not a Democratic Party anymore as a socialist party is controlling everything.
[02:12:55.000 --> 02:13:00.000]  Controlling the media is controlling Hollywood, by the way, which, you know, they've blacklisted me.
[02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000]  I cannot get any work at all.
[02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000]  I don't make a living as an actor anymore.
[02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:07.000]  I've put everything on the line for the American people, for this country.
[02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:09.000]  And I'm going to win because this is what I have to do.
[02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:12.000]  And this is what we have to do together as people of this country.
[02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000]  Otherwise, we're going to lose it.
[02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:21.000]  Aren't we in solidarity yourself, myself, Trump, Sheriff Orpio, countless others that just follow the law, do the right thing,
[02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:26.000]  try to unify the country, try to get the stock market going again, try to take care of the veterans,
[02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:29.000]  try to actually block radical Islamists who are unvetted from coming in.
[02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:32.000]  Just common sense, default stuff.
[02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:37.000]  You know, Supreme Court ruled nine to zero that Trump's travel ban was absolutely constitutional.
[02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:40.000]  And then we all get boycotted, attacked, death-threaded.
[02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:46.000]  But really, that makes us brothers and sisters that we're going through the gauntlet because freedom's never free.
[02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000]  But it shows us how high the stakes are.
[02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000]  We're dealing with true authoritarians.
[02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:55.000]  We're dealing with, you know, we got to keep our constitution, our second amendment, you know, the bill of rights.
[02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:56.000]  Those are great things.
[02:13:56.000 --> 02:14:00.000]  You know, we live in the greatest country in the world where the laws actually work.
[02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:03.000]  The laws in the books actually work and make sense.
[02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:09.000]  And these people on the left and the mainstream media try all the time from Pelosi to everybody across the board.
[02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:13.000]  They try all the time to change the law so it can suit them.
[02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.000]  They take so much money from the lobbyists.
[02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:19.000]  What I've seen in Washington, I've been there many times now, and I'm going to go there and fight for this,
[02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:21.000]  their work is so hard for the lobbyists.
[02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:24.000]  They're taking so much money, and the people are the last in line.
[02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000]  The veterans get nothing.
[02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:31.000]  The people of this country who pay taxes every single day get nothing in return from this party.
[02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:32.000]  They should be at disgrace.
[02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:36.000]  They should not even go to work every day because of what they do.
[02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:43.000]  Notice Trump, day one in office, fired every lobbyist that was in the executive branch.
[02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000]  That's why they're so pissed.
[02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:49.000]  Our president cannot be controlled.
[02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:56.000]  We have characters in the Republican Party who had the chance to repeal and replace Obamacare, and they didn't do it.
[02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000]  What a disgrace.
[02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:02.000]  We've been waiting so long to get this done, and all of a sudden we had a chance of a lifetime,
[02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:06.000]  and they're doing it because they're fighting for the other party.
[02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000]  They're fighting against our president.
[02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:11.000]  So I say to everybody out there, all the people that love this country,
[02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:15.000]  stand with our president because there's lies, and they're going to keep lying.
[02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:19.000]  They're going to make stuff up every single day, and we've got to stand for our president.
[02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:23.000]  Because if you stand for our president, you stand for the American that we all love.
[02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:26.000]  And so we've got to stand up to it, and we can't give up.
[02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:29.000]  We've got to fight till the end, and I'm going to fight all year long.
[02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:31.000]  I have fundraisers going on.
[02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:32.000]  I'm talking to people.
[02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:36.000]  I'm working day and night, and like I said, I'm making no money at all.
[02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:42.000]  So please donate to my cause, vote at Tony.com every single day.
[02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:45.000]  Whatever you can donate, I'll take it because we need to win it.
[02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:47.000]  This is really, really important.
[02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:49.000]  Absolutely, and you have hit TV shows, hit movies.
[02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:50.000]  We're doing very, very well.
[02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000]  You knew what you were doing.
[02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000]  I've talked to a lot of other high-level producers you name it.
[02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:59.000]  They even find out you talk at a cocktail party that you're a conservative, a Christian libertarian.
[02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:00.000]  You're ostracized.
[02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:04.000]  It's very cult-like now, and Trump has lost hundreds of millions of dollars.
[02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.000]  They're harassing his renters now.
[02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:12.000]  They're going after his whole family, and we've just got to really admire the fact that $400 billion in new jobs,
[02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:16.000]  $1.5 million in new jobs, $4 trillion in the stock market.
[02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:21.000]  He's delivered on everything he could executively, killing the TPP, renegotiating these deals,
[02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:30.000]  and they are so angry, and it's just so honorable to finally see somebody that just keeps doing what they said they would do.
[02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:34.000]  What do you make of them on CNN and stuff saying they want to kill him?
[02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000]  Well, listen, they should go to jail.
[02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:40.000]  They should be arrested for what they're saying and what they're talking about.
[02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:41.000]  But the ratings are showing.
[02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:48.000]  I mean, listen, they're losing a lot of viewers every single day because the American people are sick and tired of these lies.
[02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:55.000]  I mean, now they're taking statues down, and I talk to people all the time from the left and from the right.
[02:16:55.000 --> 02:17:02.000]  Statues, those are memories that reminds us of the good and the bad that happened in the past.
[02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000]  Should we take down the Colosseum?
[02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:08.000]  Because back in the day when I'm from Rome, the Colosseum killed a lot of Christians.
[02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000]  So should we just destroy the Colosseum?
[02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:14.000]  Should we destroy everything that stands to remind us about what we've been through?
[02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:20.000]  I mean, I lost people, my family members at Auschwitz through the war.
[02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:28.000]  You know, I'm an Italian Jew, I'm proud of my heritage, I'm proud of the fact that I came to this country and worked my butt off trying to be an American.
[02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:35.000]  And imagine if I was having a production company and I was making movies and I would only hire Republicans.
[02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.000]  I would never hire a Democrat.
[02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:41.000]  I would never work again on top of that.
[02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:42.000]  I mean, it would be crazy.
[02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:43.000]  So that's what they're doing.
[02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:44.000]  Hollywood is doing that.
[02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:51.000]  And so unfair, and I'm fighting for that because they're bullying people, they're telling people what they should believe and what they shouldn't believe.
[02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.000]  I believe in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:54.000]  I believe in this country.
[02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000]  And I'm a Republican and I'm in Hollywood.
[02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:57.000]  You don't want to hire me?
[02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:58.000]  Well, I'm going for Congress.
[02:17:58.000 --> 02:17:59.000]  I'm going to fight for the American people.
[02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:00.000]  I'm going to win this.
[02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000]  And I'm coming back at you stronger than ever.
[02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:03.000]  That's right.
[02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:06.000]  And I made the same point, but yours is better with the Colosseum.
[02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:09.000]  Should we tear down the pyramids because slaves built the pyramids?
[02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:10.000]  Tear it down.
[02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:11.000]  Right. Tear it all down.
[02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:12.000]  Tear everything down.
[02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000]  This is just an excuse.
[02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:15.000]  Well, it's the same thing in Rome.
[02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:19.000]  I love going to different museums of the Vatican where they've got hundreds of busts of different Romans.
[02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:22.000]  Some were tyrants, some were good, some were bad.
[02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:23.000]  It doesn't matter.
[02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:24.000]  It's a piece of history.
[02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:27.000]  You know, I told folks, don't tear down the linen statue in Seattle.
[02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:28.000]  That's interesting.
[02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:32.000]  We ought to have whole statue gardens of you decide who's good, who's bad.
[02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000]  That is history right there.
[02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:40.000]  And Alice, who was the most racist, you know, party in the history of this country?
[02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000]  The Democratic Party.
[02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:46.000]  I was about to say the Democrats want to pull down their history and then blame Trump.
[02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000]  Yeah, it's all Trump's fault.
[02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000]  Listen, we have a president and I respect him.
[02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:51.000]  He's a businessman.
[02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:53.000]  He's going to change people around in his cabinet.
[02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:54.000]  It's the way it is.
[02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:58.000]  He wants his countries to succeed and be on top again.
[02:18:58.000 --> 02:18:59.000]  He's already doing that.
[02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:02.000]  It's not even been a year and he's going to keep doing that.
[02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000]  So there's people who don't like that.
[02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000]  But look at the last eight years.
[02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:07.000]  Look at the debt.
[02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:11.000]  Look at the things that our last president did to this country, the damage that he did.
[02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:12.000]  Now we're trying to fix it.
[02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:18.000]  So we got to stand together as one because our future of this country is at stake.
[02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:19.000]  That's right.
[02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:22.000]  One more segment with our guest Antonio Sabato Jr.

[02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:27.000]  And that's what I was seeing in polls and numbers.
[02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:33.000]  They're saying you've got a really good shot even in that area to win if there isn't too much election fraud.
[02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:38.000]  So let's talk about that because the Democrats in all these special elections have had five of them now.
[02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:45.000]  They've lost every one of them showing that the people know a fraud when they see it and they know fake polls.
[02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:47.000]  Just like they had fake polls during the campaign.
[02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.000]  Just like they had fake polls during the 2016.
[02:19:49.000 --> 02:20:15.000]  It's even worse now.
[02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:22.000]  10-Year Shelf Life Bacon.

[02:23:50.000 --> 02:24:07.000]  That's the final segment with our guest Antonio Sabato Jr.
[02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:08.000]  VoteAntonio.com.
[02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:13.000]  I want to get him back up for a full hour in the near future if we can do it to really cover the issues and where he stands on policies.
[02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:16.000]  But I've heard his speeches, seen what he talks about.
[02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:20.000]  I should talk a little bit in the next five, six minutes about what he'll do if he gets in Congress.
[02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:25.000]  But also the fact that it's exciting to see that Republicans have been winning all the special elections,
[02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:28.000]  which bodes very well for the midterms coming up next year.
[02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:32.000]  But that's why the Democrats are so scared acting like Trump's a big failure
[02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:36.000]  and all of us are about to be arrested for being in the KKK
[02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:39.000]  is because this party is committing political suicide.
[02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:46.000]  They are so crazy now, literally saying that just every white person is in the KKK.
[02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.000]  Where do you see this going?
[02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:51.000]  I don't see it going in the right direction.
[02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:52.000]  It's not positive at all.
[02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:54.000]  These people are making stories up.
[02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:59.000]  Now they left the Russian stuff that they were worrying so much and they were fighting for.
[02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:00.000]  Now there's something else.
[02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:01.000]  There'll be something else.
[02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:03.000]  They'll make stories up and they'll continue to lie.
[02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:06.000]  And the mainstream media should be blamed for everything.
[02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:10.000]  They should not even be working, especially like CNN should be gone.
[02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:12.000]  Never return for the things that they have done.
[02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:16.000]  And they continue to do that because they carry only about the Democratic Party.
[02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:17.000]  That's it.
[02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:19.000]  And the Socialist Party, by the way.
[02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:20.000]  What happened to them?
[02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:22.000]  I mean, they're whacked out.
[02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:23.000]  They're whacked out.
[02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:24.000]  Listen, I don't know what's going on here.
[02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.000]  I mean, because this is a lot of ego.
[02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:30.000]  There's a lot of people here in government that make a lot of money.
[02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.000]  I mean, let's not kid ourselves.
[02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:33.000]  They're making a lot of money.
[02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:38.000]  They're multi-millionaires and they're traveling their private jets and they're complaining about this and that.
[02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.000]  But it's about money.
[02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:41.000]  It's about power.
[02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:42.000]  And it's about ego.
[02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.000]  It's not about the American people.
[02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:47.000]  The American people should be first in line.
[02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:51.000]  These governmental people, these people in government should be working for the American people.
[02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:52.000]  But it's the other way around.
[02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:56.000]  The American people are paying way too much taxes, especially in California.
[02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.000]  This state is going to go bankrupt.
[02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:05.000]  And the Democratic Party wants it to go bankrupt because the more turmoil, the more chaos there is around people, the better they feel.
[02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.000]  Because they want bigger government.
[02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.000]  They want to help the people, so-called help the people.
[02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000]  But they're not helping anybody.
[02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:12.000]  They're just helping themselves.
[02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:14.000]  That's themselves and they're selfish.
[02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:17.000]  And Antonio, that's not your opinion.
[02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:26.000]  Ezekiel Emanuel, Pocahontas, all those folks, Elizabeth Warren, admit the plan was to bankrupt healthcare and totally socialize it.
[02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:31.000]  And they're wrecking it on purpose while tripling prices and bankrupting the economy.
[02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:34.000]  I mean, they're like super villains.
[02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:35.000]  They're super villains.
[02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:36.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:37.000]  They're trying to destroy this country.
[02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:39.000]  And like I said, there's more turmoil.
[02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:40.000]  There's more chaos.
[02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.000]  There's more negative among people.
[02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:43.000]  There's more division.
[02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:44.000]  They're better for them.
[02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:46.000]  So they can say, I can help you now.
[02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:48.000]  But you're doing really good in the polls.
[02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:53.000]  Why are you connecting so well with people there in a hardcore Democrat area?
[02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.000]  Because I'm not a politician.
[02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:56.000]  I'm a real guy.
[02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:57.000]  I'm going to go to Washington.
[02:26:57.000 --> 02:27:00.000]  I'm going to talk to the president and then talk to both parties.
[02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:02.000]  I'm not afraid of the Democratic Party.
[02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:08.000]  I'm not afraid of them because they have their college degrees and they have their money and they have their private jets and they have their secret service and this.
[02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:09.000]  And I'm not afraid of them.
[02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:11.000]  I am here for the American people.
[02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:12.000]  I put everything on the line.
[02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:13.000]  I've been through a lot.
[02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:14.000]  I'm a tough kid from Italy, man.
[02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:16.000]  I can, I can fight till the end.
[02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:18.000]  And these guys got nothing on me.
[02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:20.000]  You got to bring a whole bunch of people.
[02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:23.000]  You got to bring a whole army to fight me because I want to win.
[02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:25.000]  I actually live in my community.
[02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:28.000]  I actually have my kids that go to school in this community.
[02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:30.000]  My opponent has not lived here.
[02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:32.000]  She doesn't know about the Latino community.
[02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:38.000]  She doesn't know about the families that are suffering from addiction, overwhelming from, from, you're talking about heroin addiction.
[02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:41.000]  It's taking over the country and especially my community.
[02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:42.000]  They're not talking about that.
[02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:51.000]  They're not talking about passing laws like AB 109, early prisoner release that is causing a lot of home invasion, a lot of crime.
[02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.000]  They're not talking about that.
[02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:57.000]  Listen, we are in a, in a time right now where we can get our country back.
[02:27:57.000 --> 02:28:02.000]  And we can, this is the only, this is the only county in California, winnable.
[02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:04.000]  And I can win this.
[02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:11.000]  So if we get this county read again, then we can maybe down the line, get our state back read again, like it used to be.
[02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:14.000]  And we can bring the state back to where it should be.
[02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:16.000]  Yeah, everybody talks about the state is doing well.
[02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:17.000]  It's not doing well.
[02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:19.000]  This state is doing extremely bad.
[02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:21.000]  He's going to file bankruptcy.
[02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:22.000]  He's going to go straight into the ocean.
[02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:23.000]  Well, I agree.
[02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:25.000]  And the best defense is an offense.
[02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:27.000]  The democratic system creates a hell.
[02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:38.000]  We need people like you that are smart, handsome, focused, fearless, dedicated, there to create an island, a beachhead to then start waking people up sector by sector.
[02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:40.000]  So folks, you to go to voteantonio.com.
[02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:42.000]  How do people on the ground though?
[02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:45.000]  We have six or seven stations in California.
[02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:46.000]  We're on in Southern California.
[02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:51.000]  How do people actually physically come join you and, you know, help you?
[02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:52.000]  Well, go to the, go to the website.
[02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:54.000]  Obviously, vote, votedtonia.com.

[02:28:57.000 --> 02:29:00.000]  I want to really sit down for the next three to four months.
[02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:04.000]  I'm going to sit down to all the heads of my, of my community and we're going to sit down.
[02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:06.000]  I want to hear about the issues.
[02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:09.000]  I want to talk to the people face on and go, okay, I can help you here.

[02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:12.000]  What is your need?
[02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:13.000]  What is it?
[02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:15.000]  One thing that you really need for this county?
[02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.000]  Because I want to hear it from the police officer.
[02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:19.000]  I want to hear from the, from the teachers.
[02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:21.000]  You know, I want to hear from everybody across the board.
[02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:22.000]  So that's how you can help.
[02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:24.000]  And then I'm going to take all that information.
[02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:27.000]  I'm going to go to Washington and I'm going to win for that.
[02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:28.000]  Wow.

[02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:02.000]  planet.
[02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:05.000]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of
[02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:09.000]  southern Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade grown
[02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:10.000]  Arabica beans.
[02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:15.000]  We have now managed to secure the sought after beans in a highly customized blend.

[02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:29.000]  and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:33.000]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee and it's taken us years to secure connections
[02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:36.000]  directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:39.000]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two and I don't think you're going to be
[02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:40.000]  disappointed.

[02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:57.000]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[02:31:57.000 --> 02:32:01.000]  And in the last four or five years doing more and more research, I came across the
[02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:06.000]  fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors
[02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:10.000]  in many cases had much better nutrition than we do today.
[02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:15.000]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting,
[02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:17.000]  killing and then processing.
[02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:22.000]  And so I set out to develop caveman, but to not just have concentrated bone broth
[02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:28.000]  from chicken, but seven other super food ingredients known for cleansing and super
[02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:31.000]  charging the body at the same time.
[02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:33.000]  Info wars isn't just fighting the globalist.

[02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:49.000]  So please secure your caveman today at info wars life dot com or by calling toll free
[02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:58.000]  triple eight two five three three one three nine.
[02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:03.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:08.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:13.000]  You know, MSNBC got caught with her code name for the president, the trash man.
[02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:14.000]  And I made the point.
[02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:16.000]  Yeah, the trash man carries out the trash.
[02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:19.000]  It's a very enduring name.
[02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:21.000]  And then Hillary came out with this new book.
[02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:24.000]  Her last book literally sold like 10,000 copies.
[02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:27.000]  That's joke level.
[02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:30.000]  Trumps are like selling 510 million.
[02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:33.000]  That show you who's really popular.
[02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:36.000]  And she's calling the book.
[02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:40.000]  What happened?
[02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:42.000]  And it's basically, well, I'll tell you what happened.
[02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:43.000]  People hate you.
[02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:46.000]  People know you're a liar. People know you're a fraud.
[02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:47.000]  People know you're a scammer.
[02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:49.000]  People rejected you.
[02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:53.000]  They rejected all the crimes you and your husband have committed the looting Haiti,
[02:33:53.000 --> 02:34:02.000]  the all the wars, the funding radical Islam, the Obamacare, the Hillary care, all of it.
[02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:03.000]  So that's the title.
[02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:05.000]  What happened?
[02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:09.000]  And people have trolled it.
[02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:12.000]  And they've taken the book cover and changed it with thousands of different really
[02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:13.000]  hilarious things.
[02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:18.000]  Until you realize it's not hilarious because it's a chronicle of the incredible crimes.
[02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:24.000]  And it's nothing but a clear cut indictment.
[02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:27.000]  Crystal clear of how much they've gotten away with.
[02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:31.000]  I saw a video Paul did, I guess live on air Tuesday when he was hosting,
[02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:34.000]  where he chronicled some of the things Hillary's done.
[02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:38.000]  And it gave me a headache because I was thinking of all these other crimes they've committed.
[02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:47.000]  So many, it made me have sorrow for the supporters of the Democratic Party.
[02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:52.000]  Because you've got Paul Ryan and the slimy Republican blue bloods and Mitch McConnell's
[02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:58.000]  horrible evil people that wrote Obamacare for big insurance companies to screw you over
[02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:04.000]  and dilute the economy and then bankrupt it and have a truly socialist fascist model
[02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:10.000]  where then there'd be one coverage group per sector and then they could charge you
[02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:11.000]  whatever they wanted.
[02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:16.000]  So big banks fascist making unlimited profits with a socialist model with the
[02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:26.000]  idiot constituents thinking we're trying to take away their toy.
[02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:34.000]  If you had a dog toy with cyanide on it, a little rope, they played tug of war on it.
[02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:38.000]  If the dog knew it was poison, the dog would run up and grab it and bite on it.
[02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:40.000]  But you sit there and play tug of war with them.
[02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:42.000]  You're not going to get your free goodies.
[02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:44.000]  Oh Trump's taking it all.
[02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:48.000]  You're just chomping for the poison, just begging for it.
[02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:54.000]  And then I see these weird, pseudo-intellectual, arrogant, stupid liberals
[02:35:54.000 --> 02:36:01.000]  and the shows they all watch like NPR and stuff that have these real soft, pretentious voices
[02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:04.000]  and it's all the same thing regurgitated over and over again.
[02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:09.000]  And then I see the big fitness and athletic groups in the country going that way.
[02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:14.000]  And I see other talk show hosts that I've known getting real pseudo-intellectual where they sit there
[02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:20.000]  and do interviews and have on another social justice warrior and virtue signal back and forth
[02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:25.000]  and talk real soft and talk about how they have the answers but other people don't
[02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:33.000]  and other people tend to overanalyze things and, you know, there's really not conspiracies in the world
[02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:39.000]  because what are they going to do when 90% of what I've warned of has already happened?
[02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:45.000]  And then I'm telling you the rest that's going to happen because the globalist, futurist
[02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:52.000]  have a plan that they are building using our compliance.
[02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:57.000]  So yes, exactly what I tell you is going to basically happen.
[02:36:57.000 --> 02:37:01.000]  When I say exactly, there's a wide spectrum of things that they're doing and planning.
[02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:04.000]  And in the general direction, we're dead on.
[02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:07.000]  Do I know the date, the month, the exact way it's implemented? No.
[02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:14.000]  But I know the people running things said they got a plan and let me tell you something, they've been doing it.
[02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:24.000]  And I know Trump is really fighting it.
[02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:29.000]  There's a super squid, giant squid that's attached to us.
[02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:38.000]  He's already hacked off three of the eight tentacles and he's trying to hack off the other ones with a hatchet
[02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:42.000]  and we're sitting there bitching on the deck of a boat going,
[02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:44.000]  we should do a little bit faster.
[02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:46.000]  It's got like suckers around his neck.
[02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:48.000]  He's bleeding.
[02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:50.000]  Look how lazy he is.
[02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:54.000]  I don't even know what to say because you know why I'm in the arena too.
[02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:57.000]  And I am enjoying their attacks.
[02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:59.000]  And that's why you got to know that Trump's a real champion.
[02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:01.000]  He's enjoying it too.
[02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:02.000]  They keep saying he's down.
[02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:03.000]  He's depressed.
[02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:04.000]  He's mentally ill.
[02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:06.000]  He's got Alzheimer's early onset dementia.
[02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:12.000]  It's all garbage to demoralize you just like Tokyo, Rosen, World War II.
[02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:14.000]  GIs you're losing.
[02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:15.000]  GIs it's all over.
[02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:16.000]  GIs there's nothing you can do.
[02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:17.000]  That's all they're doing.
[02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:18.000]  I'm going to go to your calls.
[02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:22.000]  Stephen and Jesse and Eric and Felipe and Carlos and others.
[02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:35.000]  But know this, I've got really mixed emotions about this stuff because I really want to reach out to liberals.
[02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:40.000]  And I want to show them in the white papers how they're conned.
[02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:43.000]  I want to show them in the WikiLeaks how they're conned.
[02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:47.000]  I want to prove it to them and say, listen, I'm not saying go with the Republicans.
[02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:52.000]  I'm not saying go with mainline, you know, bullying Christians.
[02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:54.000]  Because that's who they hate.
[02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:57.000]  Look what you've been maneuvered into supporting.
[02:38:57.000 --> 02:39:07.000]  Fox, radical Islam, anti free speech initiatives, big corporate, you know, takeovers, monopolies, really you're attacking the ACLU now.
[02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:22.000]  I mean, you've gone so far that at least the ACLU with all of its problems politically has some basic pillars and was not for banning the white supremacist speech.
[02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:27.000]  Now, in a way, though, they're kind of with the Democrats and folks who are kind of handling it, manipulating it.
[02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:28.000]  I mean, that thing was as far as $3 bill.
[02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:36.000]  But no, I mean, the ACLU, when we've been trying to have a rally and somebody's tried to ban it, has followed suit or threatened the false suit.
[02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:45.000]  When we're just having a pro-gun rally or a 9-11 rally, exposing the fact that our government stood down and worked with Islam to do it, to take our rights.
[02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:51.000]  So I wouldn't call the ACLU the evil Democrats at this point.
[02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:55.000]  I mean, used to they were the radical Democrats, but at least they've got their lawyers.
[02:39:55.000 --> 02:40:01.000]  So they've got some code, understanding that you're in a free speech, you lose everything.
[02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:02.000]  This is a pretty big step.
[02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:04.000]  This is the biggest step you can take.
[02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:08.000]  This is into really naked authoritarianism.
[02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:14.000]  And then I see Brian Stelter and all the rest of CNN guys going, well, free speech has gone too far.
[02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:16.000]  It's time to get rid of it.
[02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:24.000]  And it's so obvious what they're doing. And I'm like, wow, what do you guys got planned?
[02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:27.000]  And then I find out they're going around shopping and overthrow Trump.
[02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:28.000]  And I tell you, it's happening.
[02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:38.000]  And then word for word, they come out from under rocks and go on CNN and MSNBC and say, we're going to use continuity government to overthrow him outside of the law.
[02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:40.000]  Get ready.
[02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:52.000]  And man, I know it's serious because this hadn't happened in a long time. I've had some of the big cheeses and stuff call me up and say, Alex, this is your last chance to roll over.
[02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:57.000]  You know, most of the time you do that and take the deal, you're the first person they hang.
[02:40:57.000 --> 02:41:02.000]  So I'm not doing it for moral reasons, but I'm also doing it for a Machiavellian reasons.
[02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:05.000]  You people are very dishonorable.
[02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:11.000]  I wouldn't make a deal with you and my life depended on because you're not going to chump me.
[02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:12.000]  Not happening.
[02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:14.000]  Full frontal assault. You want to bang heads?
[02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:17.000]  We're going head up game of chicken.
[02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:21.000]  I've already taken my hands off the steering wheel and it's locked and loaded on autopilot.
[02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:26.000]  All I'm doing jamming down the accelerator and making sure that car goes straight up the middle lane right towards you.
[02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:35.000]  And I can't wait to either collide with you at 300 miles an hour because we're both going 150.
[02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:40.000]  I can't wait to either do that or have you turn off and flip down the side of the road politically.
[02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:42.000]  Either way, you're going down.
[02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:43.000]  You understand?
[02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:53.000]  I'm either driving this car and this engine right through you and you're going to go right through me politically or you are going to chicken out and you're going to turn.
[02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:56.000]  I'm not going to stop.
[02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:59.000]  I'm enjoying this. You understand that?
[02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:01.000]  It's the opposite of being a coward.
[02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:04.000]  I enjoy putting myself out in the open with you people.
[02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:06.000]  I enjoy being fearless.
[02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:12.000]  I enjoy rubbing your little pedophile noses in it.
[02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:16.000]  So you just get ready because you can feel it and you know it.
[02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:22.000]  And that's why they're freaking out because they can feel your commitment, my commitment, our commitment is just rock solid.
[02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:24.000]  It's there.
[02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:26.000]  It's not going anywhere and it's expanding.
[02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:30.000]  And these little pedophiles, these are the type of folks that are into kidnapping kids.
[02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:34.000]  So just remember that when you want to type of folks, they are.
[02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:38.000]  They are the enemy of life.
[02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:40.000]  They are the they've shown it.
[02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:45.000]  I mean, they are absolute trash.
[02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:47.000]  Divorce from God.
[02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:49.000]  Divorce from everything good and they're not going to stop.
[02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:54.000]  So I suggest.
[02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:58.000]  I'll never forget the films in Nazi Germany.
[02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:02.000]  And, you know, I know how they got people not to fight back as they marched them in to shoot them in those pits.
[02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:04.000]  They tell them your wives and daughters are back at this other camp.
[02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:06.000]  If you resist, we'll kill them.
[02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:10.000]  They're going to kill them too.
[02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:13.000]  But see, I thought through that at the time you're kind of starving.
[02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:15.000]  You're, you know, there, whatever you're just, you're being run into this pit.
[02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:17.000]  Well, just guess you're going to die.
[02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:19.000]  You're fatalistic, see?
[02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:21.000]  And I'm not judging the folks that did that.
[02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:22.000]  Here's the deal.
[02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:26.000]  If I'm in a death camp and they've got my family somewhere else, I'm going to fight you.
[02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:31.000]  And see, if everybody has that attitude, there wouldn't be folks getting marched in to pits.
[02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:35.000]  Like I've had Hollywood folks say, be easy on Soros.
[02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:38.000]  You know, he did what he had to do to survive under the Nazis.
[02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:41.000]  And I look at him and I say, really?
[02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:43.000]  Because I wouldn't do that.
[02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:45.000]  I've already been in those positions.
[02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:47.000]  Myself, my family being threatened.
[02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:50.000]  You know, the powers that be, the power starts are coming after me in my life, everything.
[02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:51.000]  Hey Alex, you back off.
[02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:53.000]  We'll leave you, your family, your kids, all of you alone.
[02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:57.000]  We're going to just, can all stop right now if you just back off.
[02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:58.000]  Yeah, right.
[02:43:58.000 --> 02:43:59.000]  It's going to stop.
[02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:02.000]  No, you're going to be able to march me later into that pit.
[02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:04.000]  See, so we're going to do this on my terms.
[02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:07.000]  See, it's going to all be done right here on my terms.
[02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:11.000]  And I'm not, and going back 20 plus years ago, I saw this coming, classical authoritarianism.
[02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:16.000]  And I said, what's the classical way to fight it? Information warfare, total resistance.
[02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:22.000]  We hope to fix things peacefully, but we're making every mass preparation through the people
[02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:29.000]  to defeat your authoritarian operation.
[02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:32.000]  And you are so cynical and so inbred and so crazy.
[02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:37.000]  If you believe, we're going to call it a moment, you're going to execute this, this overthrow.
[02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:39.000]  You really are stupid.
[02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:41.000]  Just like you thought you were going to win that night.
[02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:45.000]  You thought you'd steal all those states and you were able to steal five, but six, they caught you.
[02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:46.000]  They caught you.
[02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:57.000]  Just because you print up 250,000 Madam President Newsweeks with fake photos of her, you know, the night of the victory.
[02:44:57.000 --> 02:45:10.000]  They even had all that choreographed.
[02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:14.000]  And of course, here's the good part.
[02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:22.000]  They don't want to stop playing chicken because they'd be slowing down and pulling off the road.
[02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:28.000]  But they can't stop and that ensures when we drive through them at full speed, they'll be defeated.
[02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:32.000]  That just means whoever's driving the car to take them down and that's to the men of this country.
[02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:36.000]  You better understand you got to be committed to this and it's going to feel good.
[02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:38.000]  You know that, don't you?
[02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:46.000]  And seconds before we run into them, you can see those eyes when they finally realize, when they finally understand
[02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:53.000]  that we're doing what we're doing because we're not selfish, they're doing what they're doing because they crave power.
[02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:55.000]  And we crave bringing them down.
[02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:58.000]  Now, I'm not going to belabor this because I barely even plug anymore.
[02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:00.000]  We need to fund our operation.
[02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:08.000]  We've got great air filters, great water filters, great non-gmail or LMCs, great books, great films, great Patriot apparel to meet like-minded people.
[02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:16.000]  And we've got a new humongoid sale, not the number of things that are on massive sale, but on what's on sale.
[02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:19.000]  Out for months, not been on sale for months and months.
[02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:28.000]  We've never offered supermail vitality, known concentrated herbs, cold pressed, supermail vitality, 57% off.
[02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:37.000]  It's never been the price it is right now with 3,596 reviews, 4.6 reviews total by third party sites, unprecedented.
[02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:38.000]  Thank you all for your support.
[02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:41.000]  It is 55% off.
[02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:48.000]  And we have X2 and Biotru Mustard Seed Delivered Super High Quality Organic Selenium.
[02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:50.000]  It's electrochemical just like the iodine.
[02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:58.000]  Those two products are also discounted massively at infowarstore.com.
[02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:06.000]  We're giving you both survival shield X2, nascent iodine and Biotru Selenium for a massive 45% off when you visit infowarstore.com for a limited time.
[02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:08.000]  Yeah, this isn't going to run long.
[02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:14.000]  These two formulas are the perfect super combo for supporting a healthy thyroid and supercharging your health overall.
[02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:17.000]  Just research what true iodine does and what selenium does.
[02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:20.000]  Selenium helps support immune system, DNA production.
[02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:22.000]  Just look at the cancer studies, search it yourself.
[02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:24.000]  Thyroid health and eyesight.
[02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:27.000]  True iodine helps support healthy hormone levels.
[02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:30.000]  BuzzFeed had it tested and said it's pure iodine.
[02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:31.000]  It's not potassium.
[02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:32.000]  It's not sodium.
[02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:33.000]  It's pure.
[02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:34.000]  They go, that's weird.
[02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:35.000]  We've never seen that before.
[02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:39.000]  Well, that's because nobody else has got pure iodine from the deep earth crystals.
[02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:40.000]  It's weird.
[02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:43.000]  It's just, just like, like, look how they spin stuff.
[02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:44.000]  It's just iodine.
[02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:46.000]  Yeah, it's true.
[02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:48.000]  It's not bound up in something.
[02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:50.000]  Plot turns blue, not red on paper.
[02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:53.000]  True iodine, because that's what color iodine is, is blue-purple, not red folks.
[02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:58.000]  True iodine helps support healthy hormone levels, healthy metabolic system and much more.
[02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:03.000]  Even the CDC states that iodine deficiency is one of the four major deficiency diseases in the world.
[02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:05.000]  But the globalists like it as it lowers IQ.
[02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:10.000]  Help fund info wars and fight the globalists and get the great products that really are life changing.

[02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:37.000]  But again, super male vitality, we can't do the female because it's almost sold out.
[02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:41.000]  Because the last sale I did, we had that when the super male was out.
[02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:45.000]  We had super females, so we discounted it to $29.95, 55% off.
[02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:50.000]  And again, ladies and gentlemen, this is a long process.
[02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:52.000]  It's done through cold pressing the herbs.
[02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:55.000]  Almost no one else does that until it goes into an oil.
[02:48:55.000 --> 02:48:59.000]  Then they age it for, I'm not going to give the proprietary system away,
[02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:02.000]  but it's not a super long time, but it's more than six months.
[02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:07.000]  And then it's why each one has its own bouquet, each one has its own flavor.
[02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:10.000]  Each people say, well, why is it really dark brown this time and only light brown this time?
[02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:14.000]  It's because it's different with the herbs and the cold pressing.
[02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:19.000]  They're not just absolutely boiling it up and heating it up to get everything out of it,
[02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:22.000]  and then calling what it is, the key herbs.
[02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:26.000]  It's cold pressing takes, depending on the herbs, sometimes 10 times more of an herb
[02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:31.000]  when you're actually putting it in giant industrial presses and smashing the oil out cold.
[02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:35.000]  Instead of putting a bunch of it in a vat, slicing it all up, blending it up,
[02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:39.000]  and calling it the essence of something, it's not.
[02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:43.000]  You have to smash it out, and yeah, most of it gets thrown away,
[02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:46.000]  because it's like olive oil. You're not eating olives, you're eating the oil.
[02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:51.000]  That's the same thing. They're smashing it out, and it's cold pressed.
[02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:54.000]  That's why super male is so different.
[02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:57.000]  People say, well, I know these compounds work because it's admitted to science,
[02:49:57.000 --> 02:49:59.000]  and these are what you sell.
[02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:03.000]  Buzzfeed said it's like it's already best-selling stuff that's been certified as healthy and good forever.
[02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:05.000]  Why these aren't anything new?
[02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:10.000]  Because why do something new when you can have the oldest and best but cold pressed?
[02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:13.000]  Do. Do.
[02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:17.000]  They just don't get it. You think I just want to go out and find some new thing and not be sure?
[02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:20.000]  Now, BioPQQ is the big rage. You know, it's a great DNA force.
[02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:22.000]  That's selling out, so that's a longer sale.

[02:54:15.000 --> 02:54:19.000]  I realize during the break that I've got all this incredible science news, technology news,
[02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:22.000]  really cool stuff happening.
[02:54:22.000 --> 02:54:26.000]  And I'm going to go back to what I used to do years ago where I covered just interesting topics and things,
[02:54:26.000 --> 02:54:30.000]  not just the social justice orders, but we're in the middle of a revolution
[02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:35.000]  with them trying to take over society and trying to tell us what words to use
[02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:41.000]  and telling the ACLU they can't tweet an image of a cute little blonde baby
[02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:44.000]  saying fighting for America's future.
[02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:47.000]  And then people are triggered by that and say you're white supremacists.
[02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:51.000]  See, just being white is white supremacists now.
[02:54:51.000 --> 02:54:58.000]  It's totaled and complete scientific manipulation.
[02:54:58.000 --> 02:55:04.000]  And then turning minorities into the equivalent of supercrazed KKK members
[02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:10.000]  but against whites and then having weird white leftists that are called white allies
[02:55:10.000 --> 02:55:17.000]  that like manage it all, I mean, it's like beyond a reeducation camp.
[02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:21.000]  And then now they've got liberal businesses everywhere, they're challenging them to do this,
[02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:24.000]  challenge people to see if there's white supremacists.
[02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:27.000]  So you walk into a floor and go like a dozen red roses, please.
[02:55:27.000 --> 02:55:29.000]  Sir, you're not a KKK member, are you?
[02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:31.000]  Well, no, well, no.
[02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:33.000]  Well, you're not with Hitler, are you?
[02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:37.000]  Oh, let me gesticulate, let me bow down, let me prostrate myself to you.
[02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:42.000]  I mean, this is crazy and it's scientific and they know what they're doing.
[02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:44.000]  Good Lord.
[02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:50.000]  How do we create this amount of just scumbag bullies?
[02:55:50.000 --> 02:55:54.000]  And then led by a bunch of crazy corrupt Democrats that are funding dictators
[02:55:54.000 --> 02:55:58.000]  and slave factories in China and radical Islam and none of that matters.
[02:55:58.000 --> 02:56:01.000]  It's all just whites, whites, whites are evil.
[02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:09.000]  And it's meant to turn white people into total race-baiting basket cases like the minorities.
[02:56:09.000 --> 02:56:11.000]  I've got a clip of Martin Luther King coming up.
[02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:13.000]  I want to play when we introduce John Rappaport.
[02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:17.000]  I'm going to go a little bit in the next hour, but I can't go too long.
[02:56:17.000 --> 02:56:19.000]  I've got a bunch of key meetings about stuff we're launching here,
[02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:22.000]  but we're putting everything in right now in the fight.
[02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:26.000]  New shows, David Knight in the weekday mornings, new shows starting next week.
[02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:28.000]  We need your hopes and prayers.
[02:56:28.000 --> 02:56:30.000]  And I'm not bitching and complaining.
[02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:31.000]  I love you.
[02:56:31.000 --> 02:56:35.000]  And I appreciate all your help, folks, but we are all in and the war is now.
[02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:38.000]  And they are getting ready to try to kill Trump the next month.
[02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:39.000]  They've set it themselves.
[02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:42.000]  And I told you, you'd see him heat up like this before they did.
[02:56:42.000 --> 02:56:48.000]  And my goodness, they are following an exact profile for the attack.
[02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:50.000]  They could drug him and say he collapsed.
[02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:52.000]  They could kill him or they make car bomb a building.
[02:56:52.000 --> 02:56:54.000]  Say that his listeners did it or his supporters.
[02:56:54.000 --> 02:56:58.000]  I mean, you can see the cards they got, the cards they were dealt,
[02:56:58.000 --> 02:57:00.000]  the cards they've played before.
[02:57:00.000 --> 02:57:01.000]  And we know this.
[02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:03.000]  We're in the zone right now.
[02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:05.000]  Danger, Will Robinson.
[02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:10.000]  So people ought to be hitting their knees before the good Lord above.
[02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:14.000]  People argue about God's name, Yahweh, Jehovah, Jesus Christ, God, the Father,
[02:57:14.000 --> 02:57:15.000]  the Holy Spirit.
[02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:16.000]  Everybody knows who God is.
[02:57:16.000 --> 02:57:17.000]  We love God.
[02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:19.000]  We have a relationship with God, the Holy Spirit.
[02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:24.000]  And we know who the devil is and it's real.
[02:57:24.000 --> 02:57:28.000]  The only thing I fear is being separated from God.
[02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:31.000]  And that doesn't mean I'm up here high and mighty and doesn't mean I don't sin.
[02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:33.000]  But I love God.
[02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:35.000]  And I can feel God.
[02:57:35.000 --> 02:57:37.000]  And I can also feel the enemy.
[02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:43.000]  And let me tell you, the enemy, the enemy has got dead kids on its breath.
[02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:46.000]  So you just think about that.
[02:57:46.000 --> 02:57:49.000]  And they have tortured the daylights out of me and it's made me stronger.
[02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:52.000]  But I got to tell you, it's these people are bad news.
[02:57:52.000 --> 02:57:54.000]  Tennessee and Virginia, you're on the air.
[02:57:54.000 --> 02:57:59.000]  Go ahead.
[02:57:59.000 --> 02:58:01.000]  Thanks for having me on the show.
[02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:06.000]  Hey, I just wanted to ask you, man, and get your thoughts on getting some credit from
[02:58:06.000 --> 02:58:11.000]  Trump, man, you do such a great job and I know it's controversy about bringing
[02:58:11.000 --> 02:58:13.000]  Trump on the show or whatnot.
[02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:15.000]  But how about Trump speaking out for you one time?
[02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:17.000]  Like the other night, he mentioned Hannity.
[02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:19.000]  That's safe for them to do.
[02:58:19.000 --> 02:58:21.000]  They can misrepresent what I say.
[02:58:21.000 --> 02:58:22.000]  I'm going to come back to you.
[02:58:22.000 --> 02:58:23.000]  Stay there, Jesse.
[02:58:23.000 --> 02:58:24.000]  Here's the deal.
[02:58:24.000 --> 02:58:29.000]  Trump offered to come on my show in January and a phone call with me and I said, I told
[02:58:29.000 --> 02:58:31.000]  him, sir, you don't need to do that.
[02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:32.000]  It was my decision.
[02:58:32.000 --> 02:58:33.000]  Thank you for my decision.
[02:58:33.000 --> 02:58:35.000]  That's how honorable he is.
[02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:37.000]  They can misrepresent it.
[02:58:37.000 --> 02:58:39.000]  They take my stature out of position.
[02:58:39.000 --> 02:58:43.000]  I just, that's why he's not on.
[02:58:43.000 --> 02:58:49.000]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality info wars, biome defense,
[02:58:49.000 --> 02:58:50.000]  probiotic.
[02:58:50.000 --> 02:58:57.000]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have
[02:58:57.000 --> 02:59:04.000]  been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[02:59:04.000 --> 02:59:10.000]  Biome defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over
[02:59:10.000 --> 02:59:16.000]  23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[02:59:16.000 --> 02:59:21.000]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading
[02:59:21.000 --> 02:59:23.000]  probiotic on the market.

[02:59:32.000 --> 02:59:36.000]  We've been testing this formula for years, but this is the limited first round of the
[02:59:36.000 --> 02:59:37.000]  public.
[02:59:37.000 --> 03:00:03.000]  Please take advantage of it today, support your own health and support the info war.
[03:00:03.000 --> 03:00:21.000]  You are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:21.000 --> 03:00:23.000]  John Rappaport is going to be hosting this hour.
[03:00:23.000 --> 03:00:24.000]  I want to finish with some of your calls.
[03:00:24.000 --> 03:00:27.000]  I don't want to sound like a big wig here, okay.
[03:00:27.000 --> 03:00:31.000]  The enemy's coming after me because they got my phones tapped, that's been in the news,
[03:00:31.000 --> 03:00:34.000]  and they know what we're doing, okay.
[03:00:34.000 --> 03:00:38.000]  And what we're doing is legal and lawful, but we don't want to give up sources.
[03:00:38.000 --> 03:00:43.000]  We knew that they're going to do this mental ill stuff four months ago, three months ago
[03:00:43.000 --> 03:00:48.000]  because Roger Stone talks to top reporters and they've had editorial meetings where they
[03:00:48.000 --> 03:00:52.000]  tell them the phases of how they're going to take Trump down.
[03:00:52.000 --> 03:00:56.000]  And I've got my other sources that said the word is they're going to do a COG on him,
[03:00:56.000 --> 03:01:00.000]  sort of telling you that eight months ago when he was president-elect and how they would
[03:01:00.000 --> 03:01:03.000]  hold it out and then when they would launch it, and now everybody sees it happening.
[03:01:03.000 --> 03:01:06.000]  So I get what you're saying, Jesse, that I should get some credit from Trump.
[03:01:06.000 --> 03:01:16.000]  But, you know, Trump called me in January and I was on honeymoon with my wife.
[03:01:16.000 --> 03:01:22.000]  Been there like three years with her and he wanted to talk to her and stuff and congratulations
[03:01:22.000 --> 03:01:23.000]  and all that.
[03:01:23.000 --> 03:01:26.000]  And he said, I'm going to come on soon, blah, blah, let's set it up.
[03:01:26.000 --> 03:01:28.000]  And I'd already been invited to some places.
[03:01:28.000 --> 03:01:30.000]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[03:01:30.000 --> 03:01:32.000]  Media has a heyday with this stuff.
[03:01:32.000 --> 03:01:37.000]  And I just said to the president, I said, listen, you don't need to come on the show.
[03:01:37.000 --> 03:01:38.000]  You're very busy.
[03:01:38.000 --> 03:01:39.000]  They twist it.
[03:01:39.000 --> 03:01:40.000]  They take it out of context.
[03:01:40.000 --> 03:01:42.000]  And I'm going to support you as long as you deliver on the promises.
[03:01:42.000 --> 03:01:44.000]  And let's talk about the tax cuts.
[03:01:44.000 --> 03:01:48.000]  Obamacare is securing the borders, getting off the back of Christians and we talked about
[03:01:48.000 --> 03:01:49.000]  that.
[03:01:49.000 --> 03:01:52.000]  And I said, well, listen, you don't have to pat me on the head.
[03:01:52.000 --> 03:01:55.000]  I know you're very busy making hundreds of phone calls today, sir.
[03:01:55.000 --> 03:02:00.000]  You don't have to call me anymore because I want to be the one person that understood
[03:02:00.000 --> 03:02:03.000]  the position he's in and just said, hey, I'm committed, buddy.
[03:02:03.000 --> 03:02:04.000]  I'm not here because I'm a sycophant.
[03:02:04.000 --> 03:02:06.000]  I'm committed because you're delivering.
[03:02:06.000 --> 03:02:09.000]  Now, there's been other communications and things since then.
[03:02:09.000 --> 03:02:10.000]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[03:02:10.000 --> 03:02:11.000]  But the point is I'm in the battlefield.
[03:02:11.000 --> 03:02:12.000]  I'm in a war.
[03:02:12.000 --> 03:02:16.000]  I don't need the president to talk to me when I'm out here on the frontline fighting.
[03:02:16.000 --> 03:02:19.000]  He doesn't need to come pat me on the head to make me think he cares about me.
[03:02:19.000 --> 03:02:20.000]  So I stay on board.
[03:02:20.000 --> 03:02:22.000]  I'm on board because of what he stands for.
[03:02:22.000 --> 03:02:25.000]  So the media has already made hay days of this before.
[03:02:25.000 --> 03:02:27.000]  Like, oh, Jones didn't want Trump on.
[03:02:27.000 --> 03:02:28.000]  Oh, look, Trump's so pathetic.
[03:02:28.000 --> 03:02:29.000]  Jones didn't want him.
[03:02:29.000 --> 03:02:32.000]  That is, of course, I want Trump on the show.
[03:02:32.000 --> 03:02:37.000]  I've done the calculus of how they misrepresent and how they twist everything and all the
[03:02:37.000 --> 03:02:38.000]  things they do.
[03:02:38.000 --> 03:02:42.000]  And I thought it's 5050, whether it's good for the country and my children or not.
[03:02:42.000 --> 03:02:49.000]  And so I'm going to say, don't worry about coming on my show.
[03:02:49.000 --> 03:02:53.000]  Let me just get you information.
[03:02:53.000 --> 03:02:57.000]  And that's what I do.
[03:02:57.000 --> 03:02:58.000]  And they know that.
[03:02:58.000 --> 03:03:00.000]  They've talked about it on Fox and CNN.
[03:03:00.000 --> 03:03:03.000]  They've obviously got my phones tapped.
[03:03:03.000 --> 03:03:04.000]  They know what memos.
[03:03:04.000 --> 03:03:06.000]  They know everything.
[03:03:06.000 --> 03:03:11.000]  And the point is, is the president has to go get random cell phones to call people.
[03:03:11.000 --> 03:03:13.000]  He's completely surrounded.
[03:03:13.000 --> 03:03:14.000]  We're beyond any epic movie.
[03:03:14.000 --> 03:03:16.000]  We're beyond anything you could ever imagine.
[03:03:16.000 --> 03:03:17.000]  This is so real.
[03:03:17.000 --> 03:03:18.000]  This is so insane.
[03:03:18.000 --> 03:03:25.000]  And I get a lot of folks say, oh my gosh, you know, Trump quotes you and everybody blah,
[03:03:25.000 --> 03:03:26.000]  blah, blah.
[03:03:26.000 --> 03:03:28.000]  And his son's, you know, retweet you.
[03:03:28.000 --> 03:03:29.000]  It doesn't matter.
[03:03:29.000 --> 03:03:31.000]  It's not about being in the club.
[03:03:31.000 --> 03:03:34.000]  It's about defeating the globalist.
[03:03:34.000 --> 03:03:36.000]  And so that's all.
[03:03:36.000 --> 03:03:44.000]  The classy thing to do is to be the only guy not asking for anything from the president.
[03:03:44.000 --> 03:03:48.000]  When he's calling up without you ever telling him or him knowing to know you just got married
[03:03:48.000 --> 03:03:50.000]  a day before.
[03:03:50.000 --> 03:03:52.000]  That's how classy he is.
[03:03:52.000 --> 03:03:54.000]  Every police officer gets killed in this country.
[03:03:54.000 --> 03:03:57.000]  He calls almost every military person.
[03:03:57.000 --> 03:04:02.000]  The guy, the guy is an insane dynamo of energy.
[03:04:02.000 --> 03:04:07.000]  That's why they say he's senile or he's daughter and he's a liar because he's the opposite of that.
[03:04:07.000 --> 03:04:10.000]  Now, do I disagree with this with this escalation in Afghanistan?
[03:04:10.000 --> 03:04:12.000]  We'll probably see that it's a bad idea.
[03:04:12.000 --> 03:04:14.000]  He said his instincts said it, but he has to do it.
[03:04:14.000 --> 03:04:17.000]  He's not perfect and I won't support him into oblivion.
[03:04:17.000 --> 03:04:21.000]  But you think about what Rand Paul said who never supported anybody else.
[03:04:21.000 --> 03:04:27.000]  He said, thank God Donald Trump's in there every day because we'd have had that mad dog crazy person Hillary in there.
[03:04:27.000 --> 03:04:29.000]  So it's not a lesser of two evils.
[03:04:29.000 --> 03:04:39.000]  It's where you got somebody who means well, who's fallible, who's not evil versus maniac bureaucracy that are endangering the whole planet.
[03:04:39.000 --> 03:04:40.000]  Jesse, I'm going to come back to you.
[03:04:40.000 --> 03:04:47.000]  Eric, Felipe, Carlos, Steven, we'll get to all of you on the coast a few minutes here with John Rappaport of NoMoreFakeNews.com.
[03:05:11.000 --> 03:05:17.000]  It is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government.
[03:05:17.000 --> 03:05:23.000]  Independence isn't a day. It's a mindset, an attitude that says I will not be your dependent.
[03:05:23.000 --> 03:05:25.000]  I will not be your slave.
[03:05:25.000 --> 03:05:31.000]  Dependence and slavery is a chain that is forged link by link with gradual infringements.
[03:05:31.000 --> 03:05:36.000]  When you trade your liberty for safety, to that extent you become their slave.
[03:05:36.000 --> 03:05:38.000]  Slaves are never safe.
[03:05:38.000 --> 03:05:41.000]  You won't get rich by being a slave.
[03:05:41.000 --> 03:05:45.000]  Guard your liberty, regard with suspicion anyone who tries to take it.
[03:05:45.000 --> 03:06:09.000]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Dyke.
[03:06:09.000 --> 03:06:16.000]  Super Blue fluoride free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula. It's loaded with good halogen iodide, so the bad halogen fluoride.

[03:08:11.000 --> 03:08:13.000]  As usual I end up cutting into his time because I like to talk to him.
[03:08:13.000 --> 03:08:18.000]  Plus we have a bunch of collars I promised I would go to.
[03:08:18.000 --> 03:08:20.000]  I don't sit there and pre-script stuff when I do an interview.
[03:08:20.000 --> 03:08:32.000]  Like I was sitting there saying I tacitly will give the president time to have a build up for a pull out because some of my sources say it's a build up to confuse them as a pull out to try to have a negotiation in Afghanistan.
[03:08:32.000 --> 03:08:41.000]  But a lot of good sources and Botanik has run major CIA operations. I mean that's a fact and overthrown countries.
[03:08:41.000 --> 03:08:45.000]  I mean he's done the stuff he says he's done and that's admitted.
[03:08:45.000 --> 03:08:53.000]  He said stuff on the show that you know had him called into federal court and had the FBI come after him and he says it's horrible.
[03:08:53.000 --> 03:08:56.000]  Okay fine then let's see what's happening.
[03:08:56.000 --> 03:09:05.000]  I'm just never seen the establishment throw itself at somebody like this and lie and turn everything upside down and then they're trying to destroy me at the same time.
[03:09:05.000 --> 03:09:10.000]  You can't help but have kinship with somebody who you're being attacked with.
[03:09:10.000 --> 03:09:22.000]  Second only to Trump and I'm not complaining. It's surreal though I asked for this fight and they've got like eight or nine TV shows they admit are based around me where they misrepresent who I am.
[03:09:22.000 --> 03:09:25.000]  And then I see the zombies on the street in Austin.
[03:09:25.000 --> 03:09:36.000]  When I go in the trendy areas and again most areas nine out of ten folks you know that talks to me are supporters but now it's really vicious people that run up and threaten to attack me.
[03:09:36.000 --> 03:09:42.000]  And then as soon as I turn they run like they're a cat that's been startled you know a cat that saw a cucumber.
[03:09:42.000 --> 03:09:49.000]  And then I go please talk to me I just want to tell you what I really said they go no shut up and then laugh at me.
[03:09:49.000 --> 03:09:55.000]  Like it's junior high and I'm not in the cool club and they just are victims.
[03:09:55.000 --> 03:10:06.000]  And then CNN and all of them announced go out bully Trump supporters ask people who they support getting people's faces don't give them service if you're a florist don't give them service if you're a coffee shop.
[03:10:06.000 --> 03:10:21.000]  That's part of that thing they were doing that they dropped at Starbucks six months ago where they said tell us that you believe in racial profiling and you believe there's racism and say you're sorry and if you're white give us your testimony of how you admit you're bad.
[03:10:21.000 --> 03:10:37.000]  I mean this is be this is reeducation camp this is when you're in a sports stadium you know in Eastern Europe because the Russians took over in 1967 and they've got TV movie screens projecting propaganda telling you your founding fathers were dirt bags and that Jesus rots in hell.
[03:10:37.000 --> 03:10:51.000]  I mean this is red dawn level crazy town. Okay. I mean it's so crazy that I can't believe they've gotten to this point without a shooting war and I'm not calling for shooting war.
[03:10:51.000 --> 03:10:55.000]  And then they're everywhere saying they're preparing to kill the president.
[03:10:55.000 --> 03:11:00.000]  And then I remember talking to stone who was talking to his sources I talked to the day should go ahead and tell it.
[03:11:00.000 --> 03:11:12.000]  He didn't just guess back on May 16th that they were going to we were at dinner myself my parents and he and my children at the J. W. Mary on.
[03:11:12.000 --> 03:11:17.000]  He goes I need to step out and make a phone call being called by major newspaper.
[03:11:17.000 --> 03:11:19.000]  He goes one of his old sources.
[03:11:19.000 --> 03:11:30.000]  He comes back. He's telling me all the stuff. It's another call comes back. It's another call comes back. And then later he goes yeah I just checked it. He didn't there they sent the memo out.
[03:11:30.000 --> 03:11:37.000]  We're going to do Russia then we're going to do money laundering then we're going to do racism. That's why they just made up Charleston Charlottesville.
[03:11:37.000 --> 03:11:41.000]  And then they said we're going to do he's got dementia and then you see it today.
[03:11:41.000 --> 03:11:48.000]  I mean do you know what it's like folks to know they're planning to kill the president and then they're going to go after everybody else once they've done that.
[03:11:48.000 --> 03:11:55.000]  A lot of people are saying well we better roll over. That's what the Republicans are doing because people are threatening to kill them.
[03:11:55.000 --> 03:12:01.000]  And the way it happens is you know you can keep all that stuff you got Mitch McConnell you can keep your mistress you can keep your.
[03:12:01.000 --> 03:12:08.000]  All those you know the stocks you got 20 years ago illegally we got records you can keep all that brother or we're going to kill you on the same day we kill Trump.
[03:12:08.000 --> 03:12:16.000]  Now you're going to you're going to tell the New York Times that Trump should be removed and Mitch McConnell goes out you know what he does it he does it.
[03:12:16.000 --> 03:12:22.000]  But something like Trump they really can't find anything or something they really can't find a thing on something like me so what are they going to do.
[03:12:22.000 --> 03:12:25.000]  John Rappaport I hate to make ourselves the center of the attention.
[03:12:25.000 --> 03:12:33.000]  Gonzo journalism here but a new five day a week Comedy Central show based on me where the guy says outrageous racist crap.
[03:12:33.000 --> 03:12:42.000]  I mean there's got to be a lawsuit here where they build these straw men say it's based on you and then put this crap out.
[03:12:42.000 --> 03:12:49.000]  But I'm with you Alex it's just mind boggling that it's got to this point.
[03:12:49.000 --> 03:12:57.000]  In other words it's like they had 500,000 crazy people locked up somewhere right.
[03:12:57.000 --> 03:13:10.000]  And then on the same day they said OK let them all out now because we got them all programmed and they're going to say the craziest bleep in the world and they're going to do the craziest things.
[03:13:10.000 --> 03:13:24.000]  And the media will be behind them and make it look as if it's saying to do all this insanity that in any other situation people would just laugh off and walk away from.
[03:13:24.000 --> 03:13:39.000]  It's like that it's like they had this you know camp hidden somewhere with these 500,000 a million people whatever they are and maybe they're called colleges and universities because this has been cooking for a long time at those places.
[03:13:39.000 --> 03:13:43.000]  So smart that is exactly what I was going to say this morning when I was working out.
[03:13:43.000 --> 03:13:51.000]  I thought these are the cult programming centers the media backs it up now they're the alien eggs are breaking open the face suckers are coming out.
[03:13:51.000 --> 03:14:04.000]  It was all set for Hillary already but since she's not in there still going with the admitted censorship plan as if she's still in and they're all dug in and they don't care and they're committed.
[03:14:04.000 --> 03:14:12.000]  And then again as you said the media then backs up the insanity and these folks are like watching a virtual reality movie.
[03:14:12.000 --> 03:14:17.000]  They really believe they're Captain America fighting us as I said a month ago and you're the Red Skull on the Red Skull.
[03:14:17.000 --> 03:14:26.000]  And it turns out the new demonstrations are being led by these live action adventure people actually dressed as Captain America.
[03:14:26.000 --> 03:14:31.000]  Now there's videos of like 100 people dressed as Captain America beating up Trump supporters.
[03:14:31.000 --> 03:14:36.000]  They think they're fighting Red Skull. They are literally insane.
[03:14:36.000 --> 03:14:39.000]  Correct. Literally insane.
[03:14:39.000 --> 03:14:43.000]  So listeners you got to ask yourself how does that happen.
[03:14:43.000 --> 03:14:46.000]  This isn't an overnight thing.
[03:14:46.000 --> 03:14:59.000]  This is a long preparation and you know you know the guys Alex I mean you could have him on at the drop of a hat university professors who have seen this coming for a long time.
[03:14:59.000 --> 03:15:09.000]  Where their own colleagues are just pushing pushing socialism Marxism collectivism hatred.
[03:15:09.000 --> 03:15:25.000]  The whole idea that somehow if your skin happens to be like flesh colored whatever this is an immediate indication that you know you are killer and so you have to be destroyed.
[03:15:25.000 --> 03:15:32.000]  And they had it all in the bag. They thought they thought OK smooth transition to Hillary. This is going to be a slam dunk.
[03:15:32.000 --> 03:15:37.000]  I can still see George Clooney sitting up there on stage. I'm sure you remember the footage at the podium.
[03:15:37.000 --> 03:15:45.000]  Trump's not going to be president. Exactly. He's smirking and he's going you know Trump's not president.
[03:15:45.000 --> 03:15:56.000]  And then all of a sudden there it is the shock of a lifetime. Everything the media was doing to make sure that Hillary got in fails completely.
[03:15:56.000 --> 03:16:04.000]  Now they are totally under the gun to media and make no mistake about it. These people have also been prepared.
[03:16:04.000 --> 03:16:09.000]  All these folks on MSNBC is CNN and so forth. It's like we don't care who Trump is.
[03:16:09.000 --> 03:16:17.000]  All we know is whoever's in the White House that's not Hillary is the devil and we have to destroy him.
[03:16:17.000 --> 03:16:22.000]  Whatever way we can take him out. Kill him if necessary. Whatever. All stop.
[03:16:22.000 --> 03:16:27.000]  And here's the deal. I've got four children. You've got a family. I personally am not scared.
[03:16:27.000 --> 03:16:35.000]  I just feel like I'm not doing enough to stop the disaster because they admit they're getting ready to kill him and that means they're going to go to full martial law.
[03:16:35.000 --> 03:16:40.000]  And I mean I'm not going to go to some reeducation camp with a bunch of pot belly pedophiles around me.
[03:16:40.000 --> 03:16:43.000]  I mean what are we going to do? How do we stop these maniacs?
[03:16:43.000 --> 03:16:51.000]  Because they've got to know if they already train wrecked crazy enough to run Hillary when Joe Biden you know for all his problems comes off like a regular guy probably would have beat Trump.
[03:16:51.000 --> 03:16:56.000]  They're so arrogant they ran a herdu book on tape was like hello I'm Hillary.
[03:16:56.000 --> 03:17:04.000]  I mean it's just they're so disconnected. Don't they get they're trying to run an operation that even if Hillary would have got in would have failed.
[03:17:04.000 --> 03:17:17.000]  Now it's really not going to make it. It's going to blow up. It's like watching a bunch of crazy monkeys or you know Liliputians marching flamethrowers into a TNT factory.
[03:17:17.000 --> 03:17:19.000]  It's not going to go well.
[03:17:19.000 --> 03:17:22.000]  No it's not. It's not going to go well.
[03:17:22.000 --> 03:17:37.000]  I keep thinking you know I got to put this in here. Rest in peace two BBC reporters. Liz McKeon 2017 they claim she died of a stroke at 52.
[03:17:37.000 --> 03:17:43.000]  1999 Jill Dando shot to death on her doorstep at home.
[03:17:43.000 --> 03:17:51.000]  Both of them were investigating pedophile rings in England UK Jimmy Seville.
[03:17:51.000 --> 03:17:54.000]  Both of them were pushing the envelope at the BBC.
[03:17:54.000 --> 03:17:59.000]  Both of them were going after the same kind of people that we're talking about here.
[03:17:59.000 --> 03:18:07.000]  This is not a story that I suddenly you know diverted into. This is big just four days ago three days ago Liz McKeon.
[03:18:07.000 --> 03:18:16.000]  All of a sudden out of nowhere she quits the BBC in 2013 because she keeps pushing saying this whole pedophile thing is much wider than Jimmy Seville.
[03:18:16.000 --> 03:18:22.000]  We got names of celebrities big time people. These are the same people we're talking about.
[03:18:22.000 --> 03:18:31.000]  These are the people that are desperate to protect their secrets and their crimes and their hideous crimes and these two women at the BBC
[03:18:31.000 --> 03:18:39.000]  dead what I would say sacrificed on the altar of maintaining this worldwide pedophile.
[03:18:39.000 --> 03:18:46.000]  Well you said what you want about David Ike. He worked there on the top morning show the equivalent of Good Morning America for a decade.
[03:18:46.000 --> 03:18:52.000]  He was a top world champion goalie. He was a liberal New Ager and then he learned about this.
[03:18:52.000 --> 03:18:58.000]  He was on my show like 15 years ago saying Gordon Heath and all these people would take little girls in with plastic and slit their throats
[03:18:58.000 --> 03:19:04.000]  and he was told this by high level folks and I didn't believe and I would delay him back then.
[03:19:04.000 --> 03:19:09.000]  I would never do that with guests but you know if somebody says something about a public figure and I've never seen it in the news
[03:19:09.000 --> 03:19:16.000]  and I mean every once in a while I'll tell a host or a guest I hate we're not going there you can't prove that because you know I mean I'll get sued for saying the sky's blue
[03:19:16.000 --> 03:19:25.000]  and all these years later it came out word for word what he was saying and Seville he said Seville first guy I've ever heard say it had dungeons
[03:19:25.000 --> 03:19:32.000]  and a dungeon in his house and had sex with dead kids and would kidnap kids and kill them and ran the charities just like Sandusky and all this
[03:19:32.000 --> 03:19:35.000]  and guess what it all came out true John DeCamp died a few weeks ago.
[03:19:35.000 --> 03:19:40.000]  John DeCamp was one of the other guys I said hey watch it they're in a break I've never done that to you probably
[03:19:40.000 --> 03:19:47.000]  but he was saying oh in Boys Town oh in Penn State they run a child kidnapping deal and they take kids and sell them there
[03:19:47.000 --> 03:19:51.000]  and you know what I'm like a decade later I'm like wait a minute
[03:19:51.000 --> 03:19:56.000]  John DeCamp and I called DeCamp up and learned that he literally did have like Alzheimer's and couldn't come on
[03:19:56.000 --> 03:20:01.000]  I'm sorry Alex my brain's gone I remember you a little bit but you know what a sweetheart
[03:20:01.000 --> 03:20:06.000]  the point was is that guy was on target and why was he on target because he was in the CIA
[03:20:06.000 --> 03:20:13.000]  that's why he was he was in the CIA and Vietnam and after and he was blowing the whistle because he knew about it
[03:20:13.000 --> 03:20:18.000]  and there were good people in the government exposing it and I don't want to lionize the CIA but it's a big group
[03:20:18.000 --> 03:20:25.000]  it's people in the CIA and the FBI and the NSA that actually fought back and exposed Hillary and the WikiLeaks
[03:20:25.000 --> 03:20:28.000]  it wasn't the Russians and that's what the globalist better understand
[03:20:28.000 --> 03:20:31.000]  it's not just Clapper and Brennan up on TV saying we're going to kill Trump
[03:20:31.000 --> 03:20:34.000]  they just represent con artists trying to look confident
[03:20:34.000 --> 03:20:38.000]  the majority of people in these agencies understand and a lot of them aren't even angels
[03:20:38.000 --> 03:20:41.000]  but they know globalists want to end the prosperity now
[03:20:41.000 --> 03:20:44.000]  and you know what they don't want to give up their houses and corvettes
[03:20:44.000 --> 03:20:47.000]  they don't want to screw their daughter and sons over
[03:20:47.000 --> 03:20:51.000]  they may have done bad stuff a lot of them but they're not ready to chop America's head off
[03:20:51.000 --> 03:20:55.000]  and say that all white people are the devil because that's where this is going
[03:20:55.000 --> 03:21:00.000]  is in the total Soviet style collapse and everybody better decide which side you're on
[03:21:00.000 --> 03:21:04.000]  collapse, degradation, reeducation camps, giant wars
[03:21:04.000 --> 03:21:07.000]  or America and prosperity and trying to reform it
[03:21:07.000 --> 03:21:10.000]  what do you think John Rappaport?
[03:21:10.000 --> 03:21:19.000]  to camp as I recall was it Colby who had a friend who finally sat down with him one day
[03:21:19.000 --> 03:21:25.000]  you know when to camp was at the end of his rope saying you know I've tried every possible thing that I can do
[03:21:25.000 --> 03:21:30.000]  to expose this high level pedophile ring that of course extends into Washington DC
[03:21:30.000 --> 03:21:35.000]  and big time names and all of that and Colby sat down with him and said John
[03:21:35.000 --> 03:21:41.000]  you just got to understand there are some things that you can't push through to a conclusion
[03:21:41.000 --> 03:21:45.000]  you will be stopped you will be blocked they won't let you do it
[03:21:45.000 --> 03:21:49.000]  you've got to come to terms with that that's what this is
[03:21:49.000 --> 03:21:56.000]  this is one of those things where and this is a guy you know head of the CIA who's saying this right
[03:21:56.000 --> 03:22:02.000]  and by the way I mean the camp was Operation Phoenix he wasn't on the cream puff CIA division
[03:22:02.000 --> 03:22:14.000]  no so that's where all of this went and that's what happened to these two fearless women reporters at the BBC
[03:22:14.000 --> 03:22:20.000]  I mean 1999 Jill Dando was murdered case still unsolved
[03:22:20.000 --> 03:22:25.000]  and then you've got the scum at Snopes coming in on this latest one with Liz McKee and saying
[03:22:25.000 --> 03:22:29.000]  well there's no evidence that she died of anything but a stroke
[03:22:29.000 --> 03:22:36.000]  and as evidence we know that all of the press by the way by the way it's not five it's like ten Russian diplomats
[03:22:36.000 --> 03:22:42.000]  and ambassadors have died the last year all in their pools or heart attacks or run over by cars
[03:22:42.000 --> 03:22:46.000]  and like a lot of Putin's inner circles being murdered when they're in the US
[03:22:46.000 --> 03:22:53.000]  I mean we're in a full-bore war here and along comes Trump who finally can push through things
[03:22:53.000 --> 03:22:58.000]  that nobody's been able to push through
[03:22:58.000 --> 03:23:02.000]  one of the worst parts of this for the so-called liberals was
[03:23:02.000 --> 03:23:05.000]  it didn't really matter who Trump was in a way
[03:23:05.000 --> 03:23:09.000]  you know if you just listen to what he said during the campaign
[03:23:09.000 --> 03:23:17.000]  let's end globalism let's end all the free trade treaties that are nothing but just allowing corporations to run the world
[03:23:17.000 --> 03:23:22.000]  let's end open borders because I don't care whether you want a wall or you don't want a wall
[03:23:22.000 --> 03:23:26.000]  if you don't vet the people coming in you're going to get horrendous conditions
[03:23:26.000 --> 03:23:31.000]  never mind the overwhelming state budgets that can't handle all this and so forth
[03:23:31.000 --> 03:23:35.000]  and he's talking about these basic things let's bring jobs back to America
[03:23:35.000 --> 03:23:38.000]  let's have bulkhead doors on submarines
[03:23:38.000 --> 03:23:45.000]  right so it doesn't matter that to the liberals it didn't matter so much that it was Trump
[03:23:45.000 --> 03:23:49.000]  all that mattered was the words that were coming out of his mouth
[03:23:49.000 --> 03:23:54.000]  why? because other nations would get the same idea like Brexit for example
[03:23:54.000 --> 03:23:58.000]  in other words people in other countries would suddenly say you know
[03:23:58.000 --> 03:24:05.000]  it seems like what's been going on here for all these years is that our country is caving into globalist influences
[03:24:05.000 --> 03:24:10.000]  we don't have a country anymore what would our country be if we took it back
[03:24:10.000 --> 03:24:15.000]  what would it be if it were actually ours how could we build prosperity at home
[03:24:15.000 --> 03:24:19.000]  and forget about trying to go out and cure everybody else's problems
[03:24:19.000 --> 03:24:26.000]  and this message spread like wildfire well this is like a silver bullet to the globalist vampire
[03:24:26.000 --> 03:24:33.000]  it didn't matter that it was Trump saying this what mattered was somebody running for president was saying it with a chance to win
[03:24:33.000 --> 03:24:40.000]  don't they get that they can destroy Trump and that will only make him bigger than he's only a guy surfing a big wave
[03:24:40.000 --> 03:24:44.000]  and bigger waves are coming in against them don't they get that?
[03:24:44.000 --> 03:24:48.000]  no I don't think they do but that's absolutely right
[03:24:48.000 --> 03:24:56.000]  you know like I've said before when we talked one of the places you can trace all this back to was Ron Paul
[03:24:56.000 --> 03:25:01.000]  you know when he was running for president and the next network cut him off with the knees
[03:25:01.000 --> 03:25:07.000]  refused to let him say anything during the few debates he took part in and then just cancelled him out of all the other debates
[03:25:07.000 --> 03:25:11.000]  because they said well you don't have enough support and he said well I don't have enough support
[03:25:11.000 --> 03:25:15.000]  because you're not letting me on television and they just said oh shut up go home Ron
[03:25:15.000 --> 03:25:23.000]  here he is saying audit the Fed the invention of crazy money out of nothing by the banksters bring the troops home
[03:25:23.000 --> 03:25:29.000]  end this whole thing of American empire stop globalism make America strong at home
[03:25:29.000 --> 03:25:35.000]  millions of people began from the left from the right from everywhere began to resonate with this message
[03:25:35.000 --> 03:25:43.000]  well a lot of those people got behind Trump because the words were sounding pretty much the same
[03:25:43.000 --> 03:25:48.000]  those people are still out there and more and that's my next question and we're going to call us
[03:25:48.000 --> 03:25:53.000]  because I got to let you take over here but I promise these calls John Robport here hosting with Alex Jones
[03:25:53.000 --> 03:26:00.000]  we just joined us there used to be people having imposed at other places that had reasonable liberal arguments
[03:26:00.000 --> 03:26:05.000]  I wasn't even a mainline Republican I would see their views see their view didn't like either power structure
[03:26:05.000 --> 03:26:11.000]  but now you don't see reasonable leftist articles anymore it's all just frothing one up in each other
[03:26:11.000 --> 03:26:16.000]  who can be calling for more violence who can be calling us more made-up names
[03:26:16.000 --> 03:26:24.000]  I just wonder how much further does this go this spectacle and I really know it's backfiring on them
[03:26:24.000 --> 03:26:29.000]  so do you agree with that a and b what is this then expand into what does this lead to
[03:26:29.000 --> 03:26:37.000]  well it is backfiring like crazy I mean it's like an elastic it only goes so far before it snaps back
[03:26:37.000 --> 03:26:43.000]  because millions of people are being totally alienated by what these lunatics are doing
[03:26:43.000 --> 03:26:49.000]  they may not be standing on street corners saying I'm alienated but they sure are
[03:26:49.000 --> 03:26:56.000]  and their numbers are building I'll tell you one liberal publication that shocked me down to my toes
[03:26:56.000 --> 03:27:03.000]  in the last week or two the nation many of you I'm sure it's maybe the oldest liberal publication in America
[03:27:03.000 --> 03:27:09.000]  well look it up in the last 10 days they published a very long investigative piece
[03:27:09.000 --> 03:27:17.000]  saying that the entire narrative of Trump Russia Russia influencing the election is pure insanity
[03:27:17.000 --> 03:27:26.000]  total bold bleep by consulting experts and saying is this a hack was it a leak the Wikipedia
[03:27:26.000 --> 03:27:33.000]  you know me the WikiLeaks emails of Clint DNC and so forth and all the experts said no this is not a hack
[03:27:33.000 --> 03:27:40.000]  this is a little on the inside the nation want the oldest liberal publication America printed this article
[03:27:40.000 --> 03:27:46.000]  and of course a major media that we're not going to pick up on this are you kidding one of our allies
[03:27:46.000 --> 03:27:54.000]  just lowered the boom and said the whole Russian Trump story is a total fabrication and that's the point
[03:27:54.000 --> 03:28:00.000]  people wanting to keep their intellectual honesty to a point just from their own point of pride
[03:28:00.000 --> 03:28:06.000]  how far can all this race stuff go it's I mean they go he never decried this he decried it all the tweets
[03:28:06.000 --> 03:28:11.000]  all four statements it's just not true and you see headlines bikers are protesting Trump because
[03:28:11.000 --> 03:28:16.000]  they couldn't get in the anti-front protest in Phoenix so they point cameras at Trump crowds
[03:28:16.000 --> 03:28:26.000]  and say they're protesting Trump I mean how many times you get caught lying before something happens to you
[03:28:26.000 --> 03:28:32.000]  I don't know I don't know what the answer to that is except they're just you know CNN and this M.D.C.
[03:28:32.000 --> 03:28:38.000]  they're just digging their own graves they think they're on top they're just like a bunch of
[03:28:38.000 --> 03:28:44.000]  psychotic children that are being called news reporters you just said it we're going to come back
[03:28:44.000 --> 03:28:48.000]  and take calls and I love coast and what do you put down reports here probably have his own show
[03:28:48.000 --> 03:28:54.000]  soon as soon as we get more crew members hired to run it I've run people I've hired people I've worked
[03:28:54.000 --> 03:28:58.000]  with over the years that as soon as they get a little bit of power they believe driving a sports car
[03:28:58.000 --> 03:29:04.000]  wearing a sports jacket makes them like this Mr. Fancy pants and they don't care actually about
[03:29:04.000 --> 03:29:10.000]  really being successful they want the image of it and they get caught up in the image versus the real thing
[03:29:10.000 --> 03:29:15.000]  and I look at CNN MSNBC with their ratings you know in the last decade in the toilet and the rest of it
[03:29:15.000 --> 03:29:20.000]  but they really believe because they get bigger and bigger panels three people ten people fifteen people
[03:29:20.000 --> 03:29:26.000]  that the more people they have in a consensus that like it's magic tricks it's going to make everybody else buy into it
[03:29:26.000 --> 03:29:32.000]  and it gets more shrill more desperate and people are rejecting it so where do they go when it collapses
[03:29:32.000 --> 03:29:38.000]  when they finally realize their own dope's a load of bull Steve Eric Felipe Carlos I'm going to you

[03:33:03.000 --> 03:33:10.000]  there was something so there was something so pleasant about that place even though your voice had an echo
[03:33:10.000 --> 03:33:22.000]  she getting the globalist mindset it's so cramped so neurotic only when you're performing the group
[03:33:22.000 --> 03:33:27.000]  think even feel like you're alive I want all the fake liberals all the fake conservatives all
[03:33:27.000 --> 03:33:34.000]  you know let me say I've been over the mountain I've seen it I've seen the promised land and it's not
[03:33:34.000 --> 03:33:39.000]  a utopia it's where our imperfection is our perfection and whereas Martin Luther King said I'm
[03:33:39.000 --> 03:33:46.000]  going to play this clip we are not about our skin color but about what we stand for and what we do in
[03:33:46.000 --> 03:33:52.000]  our lives and I can totally grasp what he was saying and totally believe that because it's common sense
[03:33:52.000 --> 03:33:58.000]  I go eat food where I want I go listen to music where I want I go stay where I want because the people
[03:33:58.000 --> 03:34:04.000]  are cool not because of what color they are and the modern left and the corporate social engineers
[03:34:04.000 --> 03:34:11.000]  all that and projected a Nazi ideology of race control and race identification where everything
[03:34:11.000 --> 03:34:16.000]  is about what color you are on to what they're doing and then they're the classical Nazis by the
[03:34:16.000 --> 03:34:23.000]  very definition race-based tribalism but then projecting it back onto us their enemies the
[03:34:23.000 --> 03:34:29.000]  classical liberals aka Thomas Jefferson their sworn enemy because the American system though
[03:34:29.000 --> 03:34:39.000]  never realized in ideals is coffin nails to their program so here is a man being removed at
[03:34:39.000 --> 03:34:44.000]  major universities across the country because he didn't mention gays or transgenders that wasn't
[03:34:44.000 --> 03:34:51.000]  even an issue then but it doesn't matter because it's not all inclusive of all 175 genders he is
[03:34:51.000 --> 03:35:00.000]  a Nazi now and I'm not joking we have the article on news wars dot com where the ACLU
[03:35:00.000 --> 03:35:06.000]  apologized we're sorry we tweeted image of a two-year-old baby that's white saying think about
[03:35:06.000 --> 03:35:16.000]  America's future you're right you're right you're right we're sorry it's racist you talk about
[03:35:16.000 --> 03:35:23.000]  white genocide that and I'm not stupid I know it's like a prison we put the whites in one area
[03:35:23.000 --> 03:35:28.000]  the blacks in another the Hispanics or Asians and different ones I get what they're doing but man
[03:35:28.000 --> 03:35:33.000]  are we really this dumb and of course there's this there is this western white man's burden
[03:35:33.000 --> 03:35:38.000]  that's a little bit condescending of Rudger Kipling and white Christians where we think you
[03:35:38.000 --> 03:35:45.000]  know either we're super virtuous or no we were the super evil no the other racial groups that
[03:35:45.000 --> 03:35:51.000]  are just humans they act just like us just as bad or worse depending on the group or people the
[03:35:51.000 --> 03:35:55.000]  different cultural stuff and you know it turns out minorities can act like real asshole racist
[03:35:55.000 --> 03:36:00.000]  excuse my French I mean they can really get really you didn't think so so we're like sitting here
[03:36:00.000 --> 03:36:05.000]  with the left the Democratic Party who's having their statues removed and blaming Republicans
[03:36:05.000 --> 03:36:10.000]  and white people and Trump for their statues they're then blaming all everybody else but
[03:36:10.000 --> 03:36:18.000]  themselves as their histories removed they're projecting who they are on to us and then now
[03:36:18.000 --> 03:36:23.000]  we're just saying oh well the minorities will be virtuous they'll understand no they won't
[03:36:23.000 --> 03:36:29.000]  on average they'll act just as bad as any other group that's hyped up into a racial operation
[03:36:29.000 --> 03:36:35.000]  and that's why it's important to be politically incorrect now on purpose even though I have so
[03:36:35.000 --> 03:36:40.000]  many liberal sentiments myself that I don't like doing it it's got to be done because we got to let
[03:36:40.000 --> 03:36:43.000]  we got to move the overtime window back they're saying the word mother and father is evil and
[03:36:43.000 --> 03:36:49.000]  hurtful or family existing is bad we've got to then pull the overtime window over here and
[03:36:49.000 --> 03:36:53.000]  talk about the issues they don't want people to discuss because they want to make you so
[03:36:53.000 --> 03:36:59.000]  uncomfortable they dominate the debate this is savage psychological warfare and only by
[03:36:59.000 --> 03:37:06.000]  being so sensitive that you're insensitive can you keep people out of their brainwashing trap
[03:37:06.000 --> 03:37:10.000]  we'll get John reports take on that but here is the man they're calling the new leader of the KKK
[03:37:10.000 --> 03:37:23.000]  I'm serious Martin Luther King I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history
[03:37:23.000 --> 03:37:31.000]  as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation
[03:37:31.000 --> 03:37:36.000]  I have a dream
[03:37:36.000 --> 03:37:42.000]  my four little children
[03:37:42.000 --> 03:37:50.000]  one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character
[03:37:50.000 --> 03:37:53.000]  I have a dream today
[03:37:53.000 --> 03:38:00.000]  not by the content of skin it was all about propaganda it's all about what group you're in now
[03:38:00.000 --> 03:38:08.000]  with this thing we will be able to work together to pray together to struggle together to go to jail together
[03:38:08.000 --> 03:38:15.000]  to stand up for freedom together knowing that we will be free one day
[03:38:15.000 --> 03:38:20.000]  let freedom ring and when this happens
[03:38:20.000 --> 03:38:23.000]  when we allow freedom ring
[03:38:23.000 --> 03:38:30.000]  when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet from every state and every city
[03:38:30.000 --> 03:38:36.000]  we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children black men and white men
[03:38:36.000 --> 03:38:44.000]  Jews and Gentiles Protestants and Catholics will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spirit
[03:38:44.000 --> 03:38:51.000]  so free at last, free at last, thank God Almighty, we are free at last
[03:38:51.000 --> 03:38:57.000]  I notice the one group that's not acceptable now in the whole liberal pantheon is Christians
[03:38:57.000 --> 03:39:02.000]  and then radical Islam that's incompatible with this it's the most protected
[03:39:02.000 --> 03:39:05.000]  because it's seen as the muscle I'll take a few phone calls and get out of here for John Rappaport
[03:39:05.000 --> 03:39:10.000]  no more fake news dot com be able to finish up but where do you and your gut John Rappaport
[03:39:10.000 --> 03:39:15.000]  you're a smart cookie how would you say it's going for the globalist and their social engineering
[03:39:15.000 --> 03:39:19.000]  weaponized programs their attempt to collapse Europe all of it I mean how's it going for him
[03:39:19.000 --> 03:39:23.000]  where do you and your gut think this is going
[03:39:23.000 --> 03:39:27.000]  well it's going to get worse before it gets better but I think it's going to get better
[03:39:27.000 --> 03:39:33.000]  because it's going to reach your point where it's so ridiculous and so insane
[03:39:33.000 --> 03:39:38.000]  that people are going to stand up on their hind legs and say no
[03:39:38.000 --> 03:39:46.000]  because they're going to have to that's you know where that's where all this is heading
[03:39:46.000 --> 03:39:51.000]  if nothing happens you know the steamroller comes down the street and nobody gets out of the way
[03:39:51.000 --> 03:39:58.000]  it just keeps on going but there reaches a point where that's not going to be alright anymore
[03:39:58.000 --> 03:40:05.000]  and the globalists are betting on the fact that they can just keep on doing this forever
[03:40:05.000 --> 03:40:10.000]  but you can see the desperation I mean there's real desperation there
[03:40:10.000 --> 03:40:19.000]  because their whole operation is being exposed completely exposed and there's more coming
[03:40:19.000 --> 03:40:25.000]  any two nations can sit down and hammer out a trade deal for example anybody it's simple
[03:40:25.000 --> 03:40:32.000]  it's so revolutionary that our president they call globalism free trade you don't need all these treaties
[03:40:32.000 --> 03:40:37.000]  every nation can be as self-sufficient as it can be and then trade for what they need
[03:40:37.000 --> 03:40:43.000]  well this is exactly the opposite of what globalism wants because this whole idea of free trade
[03:40:43.000 --> 03:40:50.000]  is just an entree into we are the octopus we control everything cradles a grave of the entire planet
[03:40:50.000 --> 03:40:53.000]  this is where we're going
[03:40:53.000 --> 03:40:56.000]  what you're saying is so profound it's so simple
[03:40:56.000 --> 03:41:02.000]  Trump's crime good or bad is these being the president and saying we'll make deals on individual basis
[03:41:02.000 --> 03:41:07.000]  not signed over to some corporate board that's secret and Congress can't see it
[03:41:07.000 --> 03:41:12.000]  and then the left is screaming he's a Nazi because he's trying to transfer power back to the people
[03:41:12.000 --> 03:41:14.000]  that's ridiculous
[03:41:14.000 --> 03:41:20.000]  exactly bringing jobs some jobs back I don't know how many he's going to be able to bring back
[03:41:20.000 --> 03:41:25.000]  but bringing significant numbers of jobs back to people that didn't have
[03:41:25.000 --> 03:41:29.000]  this thing calls what is the formula then because the globalist can be sophisticated
[03:41:29.000 --> 03:41:33.000]  they have a lot of old doddering people like Pelosi and stuff up there that don't know what planet they're on
[03:41:33.000 --> 03:41:37.000]  but their corporate controllers is in the WikiLeaks they said we're going to use race war to keep control of the public
[03:41:37.000 --> 03:41:42.000]  keep them desperate I mean it's really horrible hate letter to humanity but they've got to know
[03:41:42.000 --> 03:41:49.000]  that the dumb downess of this isn't working on smart people so all they've got is really gullible people
[03:41:49.000 --> 03:41:54.000]  but they seem to be dumbing it down more and more and more and more piratically but I don't mean in a piratical way
[03:41:54.000 --> 03:42:01.000]  more as a parrot a parrot radical way just squirping the same things and just screaming and throwing toddler fits
[03:42:01.000 --> 03:42:07.000]  as if it's going to finally make a submit and my experience is all it's doing is waking people up that wouldn't have been involved
[03:42:07.000 --> 03:42:15.000]  exactly you know they're saying everybody's dumb so everybody's going to submit well that's not true
[03:42:15.000 --> 03:42:22.000]  because the fact of the matter is all over America right now as we speak there are black people and brown people
[03:42:22.000 --> 03:42:29.000]  and yellow people and white people working in jobs side by side like they always have for the last 40-50 years whatever
[03:42:29.000 --> 03:42:35.000]  it's happening it happens every day and they're getting married and they're having kids
[03:42:35.000 --> 03:42:40.000]  and they're going to church and they look at all this stuff and they look at all this insanity and they look at each other
[03:42:40.000 --> 03:42:47.000]  and they just say what are these people out of their minds you're you I'm me we get along what's the problem
[03:42:47.000 --> 03:42:55.000]  you know the problem if there's any problem for us is where's the jobs that's the problem
[03:42:55.000 --> 03:43:02.000]  so they want us to get into a water race war with each other when we work side by side in the same place
[03:43:02.000 --> 03:43:10.000]  what we want is jobs to work side by side in the same place and apparently they don't want to give that to us
[03:43:10.000 --> 03:43:15.000]  they'd rather we just get out on the street and start killing each other that's not going to play for very long
[03:43:15.000 --> 03:43:21.000]  because the overwhelming majority of Americans understand just like Martin Luther King said
[03:43:21.000 --> 03:43:28.000]  that everybody likes to ignore the content of your character well that's an individual thing sorry
[03:43:28.000 --> 03:43:35.000]  it's not a skin color thing it's not a religion thing content of character is an individual thing
[03:43:35.000 --> 03:43:41.000]  I work next to you at a job you work next to me wasn't that the ultimate libertarian statement by Martin Luther King
[03:43:41.000 --> 03:43:47.000]  yeah I thought so I thought it was the main point of the whole thing that speech
[03:43:47.000 --> 03:43:55.000]  that's what he was talking about and there are more and more people who do judge by content of character
[03:43:55.000 --> 03:44:02.000]  who say don't tell me about this guy in terms of his race or his religion or whatever you know the guy
[03:44:02.000 --> 03:44:07.000]  you stand up for the guy he's okay well then he's okay with me content of character
[03:44:07.000 --> 03:44:12.000]  isn't that how anybody operates is off word of mouth or the way the food the food tastes you go to restaurant
[03:44:12.000 --> 03:44:16.000]  you get sick you don't go back you go to restaurant tastes great you go back
[03:44:16.000 --> 03:44:23.000]  somebody tells you that you respect hey go to this restaurant tremendous food you go there you say yeah it was terrific okay
[03:44:23.000 --> 03:44:31.000]  content of character has nothing to do with anything you just said it the globals are trying to sabotage normal human
[03:44:31.000 --> 03:44:39.000]  contact and transmission of of conversation that's the real electrochemical real human internet
[03:44:39.000 --> 03:44:44.000]  they're trying to sabotage it with a jamming transmission of race race race race race race
[03:44:44.000 --> 03:44:51.000]  because they know if we come together we're going to reject them exactly that's the whole deal that's what happens
[03:44:51.000 --> 03:44:58.000]  well did you actually meet the person who's supposed to be the horrible person who's of race X
[03:44:58.000 --> 03:45:03.000]  yeah actually I went to this restaurant we sat down we started talking he's a pretty good guy
[03:45:03.000 --> 03:45:09.000]  yeah probably get together you know whatever shoot pool you know and that's the end of that story
[03:45:09.000 --> 03:45:18.000]  it's the person-to-person communication that overwhelms everything else and these maniacs and lunatics and idiots in the press
[03:45:18.000 --> 03:45:27.000]  just like you said they're trying to block that transmission of truth between people that has everything to do with content of character
[03:45:27.000 --> 03:45:34.000]  and say no it has to do with your race you can't escape race it's everywhere it's inside it's outside that's all there is
[03:45:34.000 --> 03:45:41.000]  bologna and that's why they go oh look Lynch Hall oh it's a photo of a white kid oh look
[03:45:41.000 --> 03:45:48.000]  they're literally creating mentally ill basket cases where people are now just seeing clouds and thinking it's Hitler
[03:45:48.000 --> 03:45:56.000]  right or stereotypes that's why BuzzFeed says is milk racist or that's why Atlantic Monthly says the eclipses racist
[03:45:56.000 --> 03:46:01.000]  you go that's insane yes they are wounding people with insanity
[03:46:01.000 --> 03:46:09.000]  yeah they need to do it people go that doesn't make sense you don't understand this is their mission
[03:46:09.000 --> 03:46:17.000]  that's right they don't want it to make sense they just want to count how you into submission with this yeah
[03:46:17.000 --> 03:46:24.000]  the eclipse is racist because well the solar system must be racist then and if the solar system is the galaxy
[03:46:24.000 --> 03:46:32.000]  and then the universe so the whole universe is racist okay now we've established that so who's going to buy that really
[03:46:32.000 --> 03:46:40.000]  nobody is going to really buy that they're just cutting their own throats and this two year old or one year old baby
[03:46:40.000 --> 03:46:47.000]  that's a blonde baby right there what is that baby going to grow up to be nobody knows that's called content of character
[03:46:47.000 --> 03:46:57.000]  that's what counts not the fact that it's blonde is that blue eyes white skin this and that you know they're just liars
[03:46:57.000 --> 03:47:07.000]  and losers that think they can be winners and how dare them project onto a child evil yeah how dare they how dare they
[03:47:07.000 --> 03:47:17.000]  how dare they it's just it's it's it and then they still you apologize Eric thanks for holding you're on there with John Rappaport
[03:47:17.000 --> 03:47:22.000]  I love coming and stealing the show as I love cozy with John Rappaport it's really one of the smartest guys I know Eric in California you're on the air
[03:47:22.000 --> 03:47:32.000]  yeah um you know Trump is everything that the American people thought and wanted Obama to be you know they just don't see it yet
[03:47:32.000 --> 03:47:40.000]  and it's being hidden from them by the media but you know I'm worried that they you know they might try that attack that they tried in Cuba
[03:47:40.000 --> 03:47:47.000]  on Trump and then try to claim that he's mentally unfit you know what I mean really smart you mean you mean poisoning or something
[03:47:47.000 --> 03:47:57.000]  yeah you know not kill him but you know make him so easy you know in incapacities in some type of way you really Eric you're really smart
[03:47:57.000 --> 03:48:02.000]  I don't just have to kiss your ass it's true my gut says they're going to poison him with something that puts him out of commission
[03:48:02.000 --> 03:48:07.000]  and they have a big power struggle what do you think Rappaport
[03:48:07.000 --> 03:48:14.000]  you know it's possible I sure hope not I mean I hope he's got some food tasters I would
[03:48:14.000 --> 03:48:20.000]  well I was about to say we're gonna skip this break that's what I'm saying is that is that they don't want to make him a martyr
[03:48:20.000 --> 03:48:28.000]  and just gun him down like Malcolm X or Martin Luther King or JFK or Bobby they're gonna drug him and say he's mentally ill or something
[03:48:28.000 --> 03:48:30.000]  is that what you were getting at Eric
[03:48:30.000 --> 03:48:36.000]  yeah you know you know they have all type of different game plans you know but I think that's something that's definitely in their playbook
[03:48:36.000 --> 03:48:44.000]  and um you know and also you know they're probably honest because that would be a real detrimental to the movement
[03:48:44.000 --> 03:48:50.000]  because Trump one thing that we have that they don't have as a leader they have no leadership you know they have they have all these
[03:48:50.000 --> 03:48:57.000]  what's that um cheese was it not enough cheese or whatever they have all these soldiers and not no leaders though you know
[03:48:57.000 --> 03:49:04.000]  and no no movement could could could on some question why is that because it seems like anybody halfway real
[03:49:04.000 --> 03:49:09.000]  Biden's not perfect but he's blue collar and and I kind of think has a little bit of a heart for the economy and not that he's
[03:49:09.000 --> 03:49:14.000]  not a good guy he's a bad guy but they didn't even want Biden that Biden would have beat Trump maybe
[03:49:14.000 --> 03:49:21.000]  why don't they want anybody with real human I mean you hear Hillary and I mean who would I mean she sounds like a witch
[03:49:21.000 --> 03:49:28.000]  and she's evil why would anybody why don't they have anybody real and and and what do you think this is going Eric
[03:49:28.000 --> 03:49:33.000]  well you know it's funny you said about Hillary because you know Hillary talking come out with this book trying to bet um you know
[03:49:33.000 --> 03:49:39.000]  try to badmouth Trump and then destroy his credibility or whatever and you know it's like this man she can't stand
[03:49:39.000 --> 03:49:46.000]  Trump standing behind her and how is she supposed to take on North Korea or or or clean the economy you know whatever
[03:49:46.000 --> 03:49:51.000]  seriously man you know it's a joke man it's a joke man sure and she said that he was breathing on her throat he's like
[03:49:51.000 --> 03:49:58.000]  six feet behind her yeah yeah yeah seriously man she's they they did it and like he's like like um like um
[03:49:58.000 --> 03:50:05.000]  Mr. Rappaport said they're they're exposed they're completely exposed every movie they make is is is more
[03:50:05.000 --> 03:50:11.000]  exposure you know and that's that's been the secret the whole time is that it was a secret and nobody knew about it
[03:50:11.000 --> 03:50:18.000]  oh I meant to say that so many times I never exactly they always built this world government on stealth and now none of it's there
[03:50:18.000 --> 03:50:26.000]  Rappaport I mean what are they gonna do yeah it comes out into the open that's what happens when somebody runs for president
[03:50:26.000 --> 03:50:33.000]  and says guess what the media are idiots and there's this thing called globalism and they're taking away your jobs
[03:50:33.000 --> 03:50:41.000]  and they're trying to say that America is only part of a larger structure and let's not do that let's not do that
[03:50:41.000 --> 03:50:50.000]  let's France be France Germany be Germany America be America we can make deals we can get along we don't have to be in some
[03:50:50.000 --> 03:50:56.000]  cosmic that's the key we don't need some secret secret corporate group to make our deals we're gonna make our deals
[03:50:56.000 --> 03:51:03.000]  and they're gonna be out in the open beautiful points Eric anything else I mean autonomy you know well yeah thank you
[03:51:03.000 --> 03:51:10.000]  no no Eric you're awesome anything else um you know yeah you know basically you know I'm in California man
[03:51:10.000 --> 03:51:15.000]  you know I'm from the east coast but I've been living in California that's the man in the Bibles I'm surrounded I'm like
[03:51:15.000 --> 03:51:20.000]  I'm in the territory man you know you can't even I'm seriously we're in a T-front all these different people man they they
[03:51:20.000 --> 03:51:25.000]  you know I thought my life is in danger just because they were some of them are nice though don't give me wrong
[03:51:25.000 --> 03:51:29.000]  some of them are good people and those are nice and then some are nice and then some are like piranhas
[03:51:29.000 --> 03:51:35.000]  exactly exactly you know and and you know they're looking for Hillary either they don't look further than Hillary
[03:51:35.000 --> 03:51:40.000]  or or John Clapper you know trying to come out and in bad mouth some talk about all their speech there's not
[03:51:40.000 --> 03:51:46.000]  seriously man it's a joke man they're they're honestly the American people the real American people know what time it is
[03:51:46.000 --> 03:51:52.000]  man seriously man and the ones that don't it's like a snowball effect the Jones the Alex Jones Trump's arm
[03:51:52.000 --> 03:51:56.000]  combination man it is there man they can't stop it man you know seriously man
[03:51:56.000 --> 03:52:01.000]  I hope you're right Eric you're awesome I'm just I'm very humble here I just see the common sense of it it's just
[03:52:01.000 --> 03:52:07.000]  but we got to say the Afghanistan thing and I'm gonna go to Felipe Carlos and Stephen right now but just 60 seconds on this
[03:52:07.000 --> 03:52:11.000]  I got to say it I mean he said it was bad to be in Afghanistan we shouldn't be there
[03:52:11.000 --> 03:52:16.000]  and I understand that they can't just pull out because then it'll be like Vietnam with them hanging off helicopters
[03:52:16.000 --> 03:52:23.000]  so my I heard he was gonna like beef it up and then pull out all the way but other folks say he really thinks we can win this thing
[03:52:23.000 --> 03:52:28.000]  that's I think a really big mark against Trump
[03:52:28.000 --> 03:52:36.000]  one thing I say one thing real quick yes sir that um it might just order war you never know that's the thing with Trump you never know what he's gonna do he might tell you he might come on
[03:52:36.000 --> 03:52:41.000]  news oh yeah I'm gonna do this you don't know what he's gonna do man you don't know what he's gonna do man he might be telling them that
[03:52:41.000 --> 03:52:47.000]  and then they didn't go you know moving and he's doing something completely different you know so it's all it's all the art of war man you know
[03:52:47.000 --> 03:52:53.000]  Michael but it's unfortunate that's what I heard I heard it's actually a pullout the next year and he knew that we want to negotiate before it happens
[03:52:53.000 --> 03:53:00.000]  let's see what Rabbi Port thinks Rabbi Port what do you think about the the situation and Trump's announcement now Afghanistan
[03:53:00.000 --> 03:53:08.000]  well just on the surface looking at what he's proposing and so forth you can't win a war in Afghanistan I mean that's out of the question
[03:53:08.000 --> 03:53:16.000]  you know you know you could I guess you could destroy the entire country just reduce it to dust yeah but short of that
[03:53:16.000 --> 03:53:26.000]  the history of the country shows you can't win a war there that's lasting it's impossible because it's not a country it's like a hundred plus tribes
[03:53:26.000 --> 03:53:38.000]  exactly exactly so it's not like you're dealing with a government that collapses and everybody goes oh okay you're now the government alright we submit no it's you know
[03:53:38.000 --> 03:53:45.000]  it's got people everywhere up in the mountains up in the hills the Soviets you know prove that and they're all killing each other
[03:53:45.000 --> 03:53:53.000]  great points Eric Felipe Felipe in California another call from Felipe thanks for holding so long my friend I apologize for having you hold that long
[03:53:53.000 --> 03:54:01.000]  no problem man I've been I've been praying for the president and ever since you've been promoting young gravity I tried out the starter pack
[03:54:01.000 --> 03:54:09.000]  and I tried out X2 and I tried out brain force and they've been amazing I lost a bunch of weight my friends don't even recognize me
[03:54:09.000 --> 03:54:21.000]  okay so I went to the alt left rally or against white supremacy in Venice California and I got to talk to a few people
[03:54:21.000 --> 03:54:29.000]  and I actually want to talk to you about the people that I didn't get on video because they're the ones that did talk to me that let me know what's going on
[03:54:29.000 --> 03:54:39.000]  one guy who was handing out some communist newspaper just looks scared to see that I was wearing an info wars shirt just the fear in his eyes was just unmistakable
[03:54:39.000 --> 03:54:47.000]  it was weird I don't like that look in people's eyes I don't usually get looked at like that and everyone else is pretty cool
[03:54:47.000 --> 03:54:58.000]  I'll tell you that more people outside of the rally and outside of the protesters came to talk to me about what was going on and about their support for the show
[03:54:58.000 --> 03:55:09.000]  so you're well loved in Venice despite how it looks despite the weird communist groups that attract the vast majority of people don't want these people there
[03:55:09.000 --> 03:55:16.000]  they look like tourists they sounded like tourists they ship the anti-fiant I want to be clear
[03:55:16.000 --> 03:55:25.000]  half the public in Seattle didn't know who I was of the half that did say hi 90% were listeners and positive every race color agreed
[03:55:25.000 --> 03:55:40.000]  but there was still maybe one out of 10-15 people wanted to kill me so that's what I'm saying is it's like a lunatic asylum got released is what I'm saying is they've suddenly activated and they're ready to physically attack you
[03:55:40.000 --> 03:55:58.000]  well I got lucky I only saw like three real answer for there I asked them where the protest rally was because they started marching and it turned into it went from against white supremacy to being a protest against the HBO Confederate show
[03:55:58.000 --> 03:56:08.000]  and I was like what's going on with you like you guys know anything about this and only one guy got to see it or whatever so he was saying we have to go against this I'm like whatever they were they were a little bit confused
[03:56:08.000 --> 03:56:19.000]  I'm about to say I don't even understand all that stuff but thank you for the call Felipe I mean most people I couldn't without any Japanese Americans there's a lot of them in Seattle and Chinese Americans
[03:56:19.000 --> 03:56:32.000]  were just because a lot of Chinese have come to America were persecuted or fall on gong I go to was one Chinese restaurant that fall on gong on and I was wondering why they kept buying me dinner the few times I went there a year and finally I noticed it was fall on gong literature
[03:56:32.000 --> 03:56:43.000]  the Epoch Times and then I talked to the owner on their big listers say that family killed in China for just being peaceful Buddhist like Buddhist light and so again it's not about race it's about character right
[03:56:43.000 --> 03:57:04.000]  yeah that's the whole point exactly that's what it's about and I was amused by Felipe's comments because I know Venice California it's very hard to corral all the people the diverse piece talk about diversity you want to see some diversity walk down the
[03:57:04.000 --> 03:57:20.000]  Venice boardwalk in California in LA on a Sunday afternoon in the summer you can't get you know people to line up you got people that are so far on the left that they're on the right and yeah and vice versa you know they've gone so far off the scale that
[03:57:20.000 --> 03:57:36.000]  they're anything that's big they're against it right so it's I understand how that rally changed over there yeah because people generally look at each other and they say okay so what kind of a person is he or she or whatever that's it
[03:57:36.000 --> 03:57:51.000]  that's it that's where it starts on a human level and so these lunatics on the news want to tell you know it doesn't start there it starts with this big picture that we're presenting to you this is good and this is evil and that's it
[03:57:51.000 --> 03:57:58.000]  that's all you can look at and people going to reject that they don't buy that you know
[03:57:58.000 --> 03:58:13.000]  we're out of time I apologize it's Stephen Carlos calls back tomorrow we'll get to you John let's talk the next few days about trying to get you a regular show here I'm about to go live 18 hours and 24 hours a day and I'd like to have you part of that no more fake news dot com info wars dot com

[03:58:57.000 --> 03:59:16.000]  into the water they took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in and when the Fukushima crisis worsened as it still is worsening today I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family now in 2016 even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut
