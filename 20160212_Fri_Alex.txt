[00:40.600 --> 00:46.240]  American jobs are increasingly rotting from the inside out market watch reports
[00:46.240 --> 00:52.200]  there are now more than 260,000 robots working in u.s. factories orders and
[00:52.200 --> 00:57.080]  shipments for robots in north america set new records in 2015 according to
[00:57.080 --> 01:03.200]  industry trade group robotic industries association a total of 31,464
[01:03.200 --> 01:09.040]  robots valued at a combined 1.8 billion were ordered from the north american
[01:09.040 --> 01:13.960]  companies last year the most popular jobs for these robots were industrial
[01:13.960 --> 01:18.600]  including coating and dispensing material handling and spot welding
[01:18.600 --> 01:23.520]  blindsided by technological gains and a sick fascination with artificial
[01:23.520 --> 01:29.000]  intelligence the leftist media spews out reports glorifying an unstoppable race
[01:29.000 --> 01:33.560]  towards the demise of the one thing that has kept america humming along as a
[01:33.560 --> 01:39.000]  global innovator for close to 240 years skilled labor the numbers of
[01:39.000 --> 01:43.680]  apprenticing electricians welders machinists etc have been dwindling in

[02:05.240 --> 02:09.880]  clip but at the same time contractors are saying that they can't find the
[02:09.880 --> 02:13.440]  folks with the skills they want they're having to pull in people from other
[02:13.440 --> 02:17.600]  industries or people that haven't done it before which isn't always something
[02:17.600 --> 02:22.680]  you can make do with it's blatantly obvious that a combination of fundamental
[02:22.680 --> 02:27.600]  factors are leading to a third world future for the united states of america
[02:27.600 --> 02:32.280]  the millennial generation is simply not interested in a vocational education
[02:32.280 --> 02:36.920]  projects will simply not be built in the future or may take much longer as
[02:36.920 --> 02:41.480]  skilled labor is sparse also the unchecked and unethical destruction of
[02:41.480 --> 02:46.440]  american working families as american companies like disney have american
[02:46.440 --> 02:53.120]  workers train foreign workers on temporary h1b visas to replace them the
[02:53.120 --> 02:58.160]  new york times reported about 250 disney employees were told in late october
[02:58.160 --> 03:02.160]  that they would be laid off many of their jobs were transferred to immigrants on
[03:02.160 --> 03:06.440]  temporary visas for highly skilled technical workers who were brought in
[03:06.440 --> 03:10.520]  by an outsourcing firm based in india over the next three months some disney
[03:10.520 --> 03:15.320]  employees were required to train their replacements to do the jobs they had
[03:15.320 --> 03:20.400]  lost one former worker said i just couldn't believe they could fly people in
[03:20.400 --> 03:26.880]  to sit at our deaths and take over our jobs exactly it was so humiliating to
[03:26.880 --> 03:31.960]  train somebody else to take over your job i still can't grasp it of course

[03:42.040 --> 03:47.440]  cities like detroit for example to ruin in their wake the robots aren't coming
[03:47.440 --> 03:52.440]  the robots are here and it won't be long before automation completely wipes out

[03:57.920 --> 04:04.840]  agents accountants journalists internet comment section trolls etc etc it's
[04:04.840 --> 04:09.600]  abundantly clear the new world order global governance that has established
[04:09.600 --> 04:15.120]  itself while we were on holiday or working our third job is on the verge of
[04:15.120 --> 04:19.760]  wiping out the middle class and converting the remaining populace into a

[05:05.960 --> 05:09.080]  dressed as black panthers showing the clinch black power fist during her
[05:09.080 --> 05:12.080]  Super Bowl halftime performance she just happened to be adorned in golden
[05:12.080 --> 05:15.160]  jewelry made to look like bullet bandoliers she also just happened to
[05:15.160 --> 05:18.760]  be performing her song formation whose music video depicts Beyonce dancing
[05:18.760 --> 05:22.160]  atop a flooded New Orleans police car and depicts a young black child dancing
[05:22.160 --> 05:25.480]  in front of a phalanx of riot cops near a wall that has stopped shooting us

[05:29.360 --> 05:32.840]  happened to give 1.5 million dollars to the black lives matter movement the same

[05:46.840 --> 05:50.400]  so of course Beyonce was absolutely clueless of the racial division she

[08:57.520 --> 09:01.520]  back in the saddle ladies and gentlemen amazing job with David Knight and of
[09:01.520 --> 09:06.720]  course Paul Watson hosting the show with the rest of the amazing crew I get so
[09:06.720 --> 09:10.240]  negative sometimes looking at all the news and looking at the globalist
[09:10.240 --> 09:14.640]  operations and I want to fight them so hard that I'm kind of like a race car
[09:14.640 --> 09:19.120]  driver that over revs the engine sometimes and throws a rod but I've
[09:19.120 --> 09:25.200]  really been retrospectively praying quite frankly in the last few months and
[09:25.200 --> 09:29.680]  asking God you know to come into my life even stronger and to give me the
[09:29.680 --> 09:34.200]  discernment the focus that it takes to really take the fight to the globalist
[09:34.200 --> 09:40.600]  even more and at the same time not get so angry and so upset and basically melt
[09:40.600 --> 09:44.880]  down where sure it's a spectacle it's fun it's interesting it's one reason the
[09:44.880 --> 09:49.640]  show has been successful but at the same time the world has gotten so
[09:49.640 --> 09:55.560]  incredibly dangerous and it's only intensifying and accelerating on a daily
[09:55.560 --> 10:03.720]  basis that we all need to be in game face game time zone mode because so much
[10:03.720 --> 10:09.880]  is happening now when I say so much is happening the enemy is moving out in the
[10:09.880 --> 10:17.320]  open because they basically have been uncloaked and incredibly positive things
[10:17.320 --> 10:23.600]  are happening as well and so we have to realize that we've got the truth on our
[10:23.600 --> 10:28.200]  side we understand how the world really works we understand the globalist
[10:28.200 --> 10:34.200]  agenda and we know how to stop them and the most important thing we need to stop
[10:34.200 --> 10:39.600]  them is to educate the public with the actual quotes the actual statements the
[10:39.600 --> 10:45.040]  admissions of the engineers about what they're doing because the world is so
[10:45.040 --> 10:49.800]  big and is so complex with seven and a half billion people and only 6,000
[10:49.800 --> 10:54.040]  technocrats managing it in their own words they have to put down on paper
[10:54.040 --> 11:01.560]  their battle plans but they operated as if the public is only watching soap
[11:01.560 --> 11:10.480]  operas and football and would be unable to even read a globalist text a globalist
[11:10.480 --> 11:16.640]  battle plan and know how to counter that and what info wars has been able to do
[11:16.640 --> 11:20.480]  along with many other great organizations that love human liberty is
[11:20.480 --> 11:24.440]  basically take the globalist own statements and own admissions decades
[11:24.440 --> 11:31.920]  ago and expose that to the public then the New World Order came in countered us
[11:31.920 --> 11:36.720]  said it wasn't true said it wasn't happening said we were liars tried to
[11:36.720 --> 11:41.960]  censor us and countless others much of the public didn't believe us 10 20 years
[11:41.960 --> 11:48.880]  ago 30 years ago 40 years ago 50 years ago in the time of Barry Goldwater but
[11:48.880 --> 11:55.320]  now it's so ingrained in culture what we've warned of the Patriots it's so
[11:55.320 --> 12:01.240]  part of the culture it's so ingrained and their attacks on us are so ingrained
[12:01.240 --> 12:10.280]  and stand as testaments huge red flashing arrows pointing at everything that the
[12:10.280 --> 12:14.680]  Patriots have warned the people the planet about only illustrating how right
[12:14.680 --> 12:20.560]  we were the countless books the movies the films the sitcoms the dramas making
[12:20.560 --> 12:24.480]  fun of people that believe in shadowy cabals making fun of people that talk
[12:24.480 --> 12:28.960]  about the imaginary Bilderberg group making fun of people that claim one day
[12:28.960 --> 12:33.080]  the Pope will call for world government making fun of people that claim
[12:33.080 --> 12:36.880]  there's a plan to bring in a one-world government and a casual society with
[12:36.880 --> 12:43.040]  total NSA spying and Franken foods being forced on the public and the state
[12:43.040 --> 12:49.520]  coming out announcing your children belong to them that'll never happen don't
[12:49.520 --> 12:57.080]  listen to these crazy people and now it's all happening and so the credibility
[12:57.080 --> 13:03.320]  of the Liberty movement worldwide people that just exposed this scientific
[13:03.320 --> 13:09.480]  tyranny being developed is so incredibly strong now before I get into all the
[13:09.480 --> 13:17.520]  news I want to be clear info wars is the third wave in this so when folks call
[13:17.520 --> 13:23.240]  in giving us credit we are only a focal point and one of the brightest focal
[13:23.240 --> 13:31.280]  points in the battle because of the time we came we came right as it was being
[13:31.280 --> 13:37.840]  rolled out where you couldn't deny it somebody like Senator Barry Goldwater
[13:37.840 --> 13:46.960]  in the 50s US senator with classified briefings with the Pentagon warning him
[13:46.960 --> 13:50.960]  came out and said there is a multinational banking cartel owned by
[13:50.960 --> 13:53.920]  the Rothschilds the Rockefellers and others that wants to bring in a
[13:53.920 --> 13:59.200]  planetary technocratic dictatorship these are quotes you pull them up he wrote
[13:59.200 --> 14:04.400]  books on the subject like no apologies and he said there is a plan to take over
[14:04.400 --> 14:09.520]  all religion all family all banking all education all industry there's a plan to
[14:09.520 --> 14:13.640]  deindustrialize the West there's a plan to collapse our borders there's a plan
[14:13.640 --> 14:20.920]  to end all culture worldwide and bring in this plastic phony system you go read
[14:20.920 --> 14:25.440]  his quotes there's again voluminous numbers of typing Barry Goldwater quotes
[14:25.440 --> 14:30.880]  on world government Barry Goldwater quotes on trilateral Commission and
[14:30.880 --> 14:35.760]  Americans listen to Barry Goldwater they organize people like Phyllis Schlafly
[14:35.760 --> 14:42.040]  and others they battled they fought hard Pat Buchanan even Richard Nixon to a
[14:42.040 --> 14:44.960]  certain extent that's why they've shot him down he was really turning against
[14:44.960 --> 14:54.240]  him and all these decades later now it'd be somebody's uncle or somebody's
[14:54.240 --> 14:59.160]  grandma or it'd be so many times I have prominent people come to me and they say
[14:59.160 --> 15:03.600]  you know my grandma or my grandfather would tell me all about the exact stuff
[15:03.600 --> 15:09.080]  you talk about when I was six seven years old and you know my parents would
[15:09.080 --> 15:12.200]  laugh at him and say oh they're just old you know they're just you know they're
[15:12.200 --> 15:17.200]  just kind of goofy but now I realize grandma was right grandma was listening
[15:17.200 --> 15:23.600]  to Barry Goldwater Ron Paul was listening to Barry Goldwater I was really
[15:23.600 --> 15:28.240]  thinking about the other day who is the most prominent person at the beginning
[15:28.240 --> 15:32.360]  of the real resistance to the globalist who really did the most damage to them
[15:32.360 --> 15:38.640]  in a chain reaction because the 1950s and 60s are like 10 seconds ago in in the
[15:38.640 --> 15:43.920]  scheme of time and space who detonated the real bombs on the globalist
[15:43.920 --> 15:48.680]  operation that only today are collapsing them in front of everyone
[15:48.680 --> 15:55.040]  people like Barry Goldwater the first wave Ron Paul the second wave at the
[15:55.040 --> 15:59.920]  beginning of a second wave Matt Drudge at the end of the second wave Alex Jones
[15:59.920 --> 16:05.160]  at the beginning of the third wave and the waves come faster as part of the
[16:05.160 --> 16:11.760]  singularity paradigm as you have many singularities building towards a larger
[16:11.760 --> 16:15.360]  singularity we're now we've entered fourth fifth wave you'll start seeing
[16:15.360 --> 16:20.160]  sixth seventh eighth wave awakening and instead of it taking 10 20 30 years for a
[16:20.160 --> 16:25.720]  new wave they'll start coming every three years every year every month every
[16:25.720 --> 16:32.240]  week every day every hour until there's just total collapse of the enemy
[16:32.240 --> 16:37.680]  operation that's why they're gonna try to launch giant wars arrest people create
[16:37.680 --> 16:42.640]  giant distractions to make themselves the savior to terrorize everyone into
[16:42.640 --> 16:52.440]  submitting to them up front if you go along with the New World Order folks
[16:52.440 --> 16:57.080]  you've signed your own enslavement you're a fool and that's all I have to say to
[16:57.080 --> 17:01.960]  people in the system out of the system only a crazy person would be delusional
[17:01.960 --> 17:05.120]  and go along with the New World Order because hey it's I guess it's one thing
[17:05.120 --> 17:09.720]  to sell out 30 40 years ago and live home hog and you know put it off on your
[17:09.720 --> 17:15.320]  grandchildren and children but we're not 10 20 years off now we're we're
[17:15.320 --> 17:21.520]  entering the maelstrom we're entering the squall we're entering the storm the
[17:21.520 --> 17:25.840]  typhoon the hurricane the tempest
[17:29.440 --> 17:36.840]  and so prepare yourselves for legendary events and you're gonna see the enemy
[17:36.840 --> 17:41.040]  pull out all the stops but you're also gonna see good coming out of avenues you
[17:41.040 --> 17:47.280]  would have never expected it will be spectacular it's already spectacular and
[17:47.280 --> 17:52.440]  I'm gonna cover all of it when we come back but just a few examples of this we
[17:52.440 --> 17:56.880]  talk about super delegates in the last elections even when elections were
[17:56.880 --> 18:01.760]  stolen the public would write what would read articles saying that's not true
[18:01.760 --> 18:08.520]  don't listen to conspiracy theorist just like if they'd have an urban warfare
[18:08.520 --> 18:13.080]  drill and a helicopter crash in downtown Houston killing a bunch of people they
[18:13.080 --> 18:17.680]  just go on the news and say it doesn't exist when we had video of it they play
[18:17.680 --> 18:28.120]  these mind games but now I turn on Fox News this morning and there can you
[18:28.120 --> 18:32.400]  believe it Sanders won by 20 points against Clinton in New Hampshire but
[18:32.400 --> 18:36.440]  we'll get two less delegates because she has almost all the super delegates
[18:36.440 --> 18:41.200]  pledged to her this is stealing the election and it's not part of the
[18:41.200 --> 18:46.080]  Constitution it's not part of our system it's was changed by the Democrats in
[18:46.080 --> 18:51.880]  1972 to steal the nomination from the Democratic candidate and it was all
[18:51.880 --> 18:57.720]  true it was like I was watching my show I flipped over a channel same thing was on
[18:57.720 --> 19:07.260]  CNN so you see that's the point we're getting to now where Bernie Sanders can
[19:07.260 --> 19:11.560]  get up in a debate last night we're gonna play this clip and say I'm not part
[19:11.560 --> 19:18.080]  of the Bilderberg group I don't get my orders from Henry Kissinger I'm anti
[19:18.080 --> 19:25.200]  establishment so now you've got the socialist senator establishment second
[19:25.200 --> 19:28.800]  stringer folks total establishment but he knows the way to beat Hillary is to
[19:28.800 --> 19:33.000]  say oh look it's the Bilderberg group a secret elites and I'm not part of that
[19:33.000 --> 19:37.640]  see how oh it didn't exist just 10 years ago now it's out in the open now
[19:37.640 --> 19:42.240]  you've got to have a real debate you're stealing elections you are under the
[19:42.240 --> 19:46.480]  control of foreign elites you are jacking with the food supply you see
[19:46.480 --> 19:50.920]  once they have to have a real debate it's game over for these people we do have

[23:04.200 --> 23:08.640]  tracking an obscure threat to America today he says it's about to reach a

[23:17.040 --> 23:20.800]  retirement and the family you want to protect now he's made predictions like
[23:20.800 --> 23:25.360]  this before and he was right then to a few years ago he warned that housing
[23:25.360 --> 23:29.960]  prices would collapse they did before that he warned that calm companies would
[23:29.960 --> 23:34.640]  crash they did those who listened had a chance to save themselves but this has
[23:34.640 --> 23:39.200]  nothing to do with the stock market this will affect us all a free video he's

[23:52.080 --> 24:16.480]  that's dollar downfall calm
[24:16.480 --> 24:22.560]  let me say it like this humanity is going through massive change and
[24:22.560 --> 24:29.960]  metamorphosis not just very goldwater but president Eisenhower when he left
[24:29.960 --> 24:37.200]  office in 1961 warned of a technological elite in control of the military
[24:37.200 --> 24:42.400]  industrial complex and in control of the future brain trust and development of
[24:42.400 --> 24:50.680]  humanity and that's because they were involved in a giant underground eugenics
[24:50.680 --> 24:56.960]  program that dwarfs the Manhattan Project information warfare control of
[24:56.960 --> 25:03.640]  society GMO cloning all of it it's come out it was going on then and Eisenhower
[25:03.640 --> 25:09.720]  was freaked out and he's scared during that speech and somebody drops something
[25:09.720 --> 25:13.240]  there's a crash and we ought to play the whole 21-minute speech sometime because
[25:13.240 --> 25:18.960]  we played it several times over the years it is so powerful and they were
[25:18.960 --> 25:23.240]  taking Eisenhower and goldwater and people behind closed doors and they
[25:23.240 --> 25:27.560]  were telling them about America's gonna have the super science no one will be
[25:27.560 --> 25:31.640]  able to defeat us we're gonna have an engineered society and Eisenhower was
[25:31.640 --> 25:38.080]  like you guys are fired he fired a whole bunch of the different the well the
[25:38.080 --> 25:41.800]  DARPA had a different name then but he fired that head he fired a bunch of top
[25:41.800 --> 25:49.440]  generals and then he warned Kennedy I mean you know they came in the president
[25:49.440 --> 25:52.720]  was running the show then and he said no you're not gonna do that you're not gonna
[25:52.720 --> 25:56.640]  jack with people through the vaccines
[25:57.960 --> 26:01.960]  Eisenhower I've seen you see this in a PBS report learned about secret
[26:01.960 --> 26:10.000]  experiments on black people and ordered them stopped or say didn't stop that was
[26:10.000 --> 26:13.960]  what caused a lot of the final civil rights movement was just people are like
[26:13.960 --> 26:19.800]  no we're not injecting black people with cephalus stop it stop it
[26:24.120 --> 26:28.920]  but it doesn't matter very goldwater and Eisenhower are gone and Eisenhower
[26:28.920 --> 26:33.840]  wasn't perfect and we've had these scum run in the show ever since and they've
[26:33.840 --> 26:39.800]  basically mocked up now and have control of DC but it's so naked I use that
[26:39.800 --> 26:44.400]  word a lot because there's no better word they are uncloaked they are bare
[26:44.400 --> 26:49.640]  they are out in the open and they just play these little Jedi mind tricks with
[26:49.640 --> 26:56.600]  people of there's no Bilderberg group it doesn't matter if Bernie Sanders wins all
[26:56.600 --> 27:00.400]  the doubt all the delegates because the super delegates won't vote for him
[27:00.400 --> 27:03.720]  that's just the way it is
[27:05.800 --> 27:11.280]  but a certain point the cloak is lowered I have three articles in the stacks
[27:11.280 --> 27:15.320]  today with government in the United States this has already happened in
[27:15.320 --> 27:24.000]  England and the UK announcing that the state is over your children and that will
[27:24.000 --> 27:29.960]  co-parent but don't worry they're not taking your rights parents because you're
[27:29.960 --> 27:38.280]  equal partners just like they call the Patriot Act patriotic they have all
[27:38.280 --> 27:42.120]  these little sick Orwellian terms on purpose don't worry you're getting a
[27:42.120 --> 27:49.920]  new right you're an equal partner now that's the feds nationwide under
[27:49.920 --> 27:54.720]  Obama and under Obamacare and under the Department of Education where you're
[27:54.720 --> 27:58.840]  gonna get your CPS visit every year and and they're not just gonna say oh your
[27:58.840 --> 28:02.320]  kids aren't hurt they got plenty of food we're leaving without warrants that's
[28:02.320 --> 28:07.160]  bad enough no we're gonna form a parent relationship with your children for
[28:07.160 --> 28:14.640]  life a total stranger when your child is a year old will be assigned to them and
[28:14.640 --> 28:18.200]  will come and will visit and will watch and you can argue well there's some
[28:18.200 --> 28:21.320]  really bad parents out there the point is the more government we get involved
[28:21.320 --> 28:25.080]  the more society degenerates it's the government that ended the family it's
[28:25.080 --> 28:28.520]  the government to change the tax code direct the family it's the social
[28:28.520 --> 28:34.600]  engineers we know they're eugenicists ending the family the textbooks for 40
[28:34.600 --> 28:42.680]  years I've shown them to you the mainline textbooks say the family belongs to a
[28:42.680 --> 28:48.600]  primitive age and must be eradicated
[28:49.120 --> 28:52.400]  see they always have these arguments no one's coming to co-parent your kids
[28:52.400 --> 28:55.760]  that's made up boom it happens well of course we are and then I've got stacks
[28:55.760 --> 29:03.200]  of articles here I'm gonna go over where they are arresting people and ticketing
[29:03.200 --> 29:09.640]  people for street preaching in America and folks they're saying because you were
[29:09.640 --> 29:17.000]  offensive and the new offense is hurting someone's feelings we have we have
[29:17.000 --> 29:23.000]  the Austin University of Texas police different than APD or know what
[29:23.000 --> 29:28.040]  socialist police is gonna be like this is it nobody ever arrested street
[29:28.040 --> 29:33.400]  preachers in this country folks not even the Redcoats but in America they're
[29:33.400 --> 29:38.960]  doing it now that's how far we've gone folks we're going under tyranny right
[29:38.960 --> 29:48.760]  now wicked naked bleeding tyranny we're on the march the empires on the run
[29:48.760 --> 29:53.880]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[29:56.320 --> 30:03.800]  I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend oh feel the burn again
[30:03.800 --> 30:08.400]  Hillary Clinton's face went as green as her chartreuse chairman mal pants suit
[30:08.400 --> 30:12.200]  when Bernie Sanders isn't talking about raising taxes and giving away free
[30:12.200 --> 30:16.120]  stuff he sometimes makes some good points Sanders noted that Kissinger
[30:16.120 --> 30:20.160]  paved the way for one of the worst instances of genocide in modern history
[30:20.160 --> 30:24.720]  last week Clinton declared that she was very flattered when Henry Kissinger said
[30:24.720 --> 30:28.560]  I ran the State Department better than anybody had run it in a long time
[30:28.560 --> 30:33.200]  Clinton has admitted that she is working toward Kissinger's envisioned global
[30:33.200 --> 30:37.560]  architecture but actually we do know who earns Bernie Sanders foreign policy
[30:37.560 --> 30:42.320]  praise the Castro regime and Nicaragua's Sandinista government Sanders gets
[30:42.320 --> 30:46.000]  kudos for disavowing the establishment but in the next breath he vowed to
[30:46.000 --> 30:49.760]  subvert the Constitution by ignoring Congress and going even further than
[30:49.760 --> 30:54.080]  Obama has in using executive action Leanne McAdu reporting for info wars

[33:11.080 --> 33:19.360]  where the secretary and I have a very profound difference in the last debate
[33:19.360 --> 33:24.920]  I believe in her book very good book by the way in her book and in this last
[33:24.920 --> 33:30.360]  debate she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring
[33:30.360 --> 33:37.280]  of Henry Kissinger now I find it rather amazing because I happened to believe
[33:37.280 --> 33:43.520]  that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the
[33:43.520 --> 33:49.960]  modern history of this country I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my
[33:49.960 --> 33:56.120]  friend I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger and in fact Kissinger's
[33:56.120 --> 34:01.880]  actions in Cambodia when the United States bombed that country over through
[34:01.880 --> 34:06.000]  Prince Seattle created the instability for Paul Pot and the
[34:06.000 --> 34:11.240]  Khmer Rouge to come in who then butchered some three million innocent
[34:11.240 --> 34:16.440]  people one of the worst genocides in the history of the world so count me in as
[34:16.440 --> 34:26.920]  somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger one more thing about
[34:26.920 --> 34:30.800]  iconography if you're a radio listener you can't see this obviously but but I
[34:30.800 --> 34:34.920]  meant to make this point not even so much this debate but the last Democrat
[34:34.920 --> 34:39.880]  debate the one before that she's wearing a gray outfit a pink outfit the new one
[34:39.880 --> 34:49.400]  is a yellow outfit and it's canary yellow and from the 1950s and 60s the
[34:49.400 --> 34:55.720]  Communist Party women in China and Mao Zedong's wife wear the exact cut the
[34:55.720 --> 35:01.880]  exact silk outfits so again these are all messages to their people hey I'm a
[35:01.880 --> 35:10.200]  commie just like with Obama remember the artwork of his head turned to the side
[35:10.800 --> 35:15.640]  the artwork with his head turned to the side is directly from the famous
[35:15.640 --> 35:20.200]  Stalinist Leninus eras and then when they have the artists on TV they go yes
[35:20.200 --> 35:24.360]  I like the communist art and I like collectivism so that's why we showed
[35:24.360 --> 35:29.840]  is this and then the White House chooses terms like lean forward and capture
[35:29.840 --> 35:35.160]  the future and all this that is directly out of the communist manifesto
[35:35.160 --> 35:42.680]  itself and of course people make jokes out of it with their own posters you can
[35:42.680 --> 35:46.440]  find the real forward posters with with with Obama I mean that is with the same
[35:46.440 --> 35:55.080]  hand sign as VI Lenin now let's go back to Sanders though the reason I get so
[35:55.080 --> 35:58.520]  angry at him as I know he's smart and I followed him in the Senate for a decade
[35:58.520 --> 36:05.200]  and I've seen him when they need a vote one vote to make sure the Fed doesn't
[36:05.200 --> 36:09.120]  get audited or to make sure there's a banker bailout or to make sure then
[36:09.120 --> 36:14.560]  then he will vote for Wall Street the corrupt elements of it but when there's
[36:14.560 --> 36:20.000]  a whole bunch of votes short or whatever and and his vote doesn't count then he'll
[36:20.000 --> 36:28.320]  vote the right way he is a calculating manipulator and he knows
[36:28.320 --> 36:31.760]  exactly what he's doing and you know he wants to talk about the Khmer Rouge
[36:31.760 --> 36:40.480]  killing 30% of Cambodia yeah that was a big New Brzezinski too involved in that
[36:40.480 --> 36:47.040]  big time but notice he points out the quote Republican to always make it
[36:47.040 --> 36:54.060]  partisan no both parties and it's horrible and it's wrong but looking at
[36:54.060 --> 36:57.040]  Bernie Sanders he knows full well what he's doing why doesn't he talk about the
[36:57.040 --> 37:02.640]  84 million killed by Mao Zedong why does he talk about the 20 to 30 million
[37:02.640 --> 37:08.480]  killed by Lenin same number by Stalin I love how the so-called left talks about
[37:08.480 --> 37:13.880]  Hitler all day and how Hitler killed millions and millions and millions of
[37:13.880 --> 37:19.800]  people no one probably even knows but they admit the Germany's population was
[37:19.800 --> 37:26.920]  21 million less at the end of the war in 1945 look it up the Russians lost
[37:26.920 --> 37:30.600]  20 million people to you never hear anything about the Russians or movies
[37:30.600 --> 37:36.400]  about all the dead Russians do you know or Russians killed by communist you
[37:36.400 --> 37:42.080]  never hear about that or the Armenian genocide or the hundreds of thousands
[37:42.080 --> 37:48.400]  killed by the rebels that the West has put into Syria or Libya they only tell
[37:48.400 --> 37:51.880]  you about the genocides they want to tell you about that aren't really
[37:51.880 --> 37:59.800]  connected connected to a political movement the left is the most murderous
[37:59.800 --> 38:06.240]  killing organization in the world and it has been since the French Revolution
[38:06.240 --> 38:10.720]  I've had top historians on but you can go read the encyclopedia Britannica you
[38:10.720 --> 38:14.440]  can go get a book on the French Revolution folks it was the opposite of
[38:14.440 --> 38:18.440]  ours that's why George Washington wrote against it Jefferson who was ford at
[38:18.440 --> 38:22.520]  first turned against it at one point the French Revolution wanted to get their
[38:22.520 --> 38:29.360]  hands on Thomas Jefferson and kill him the Jacobins that led it were an occult
[38:29.360 --> 38:35.520]  organization basically Satanist and they wanted to overturn the family break
[38:35.520 --> 38:41.080]  down all of society and have a world of living hell but they would claim would
[38:41.080 --> 38:45.800]  be for the people but it wouldn't be so I should do a special report on the
[38:45.800 --> 38:51.200]  origins of communism so people understand what it is there was revolution at
[38:51.200 --> 38:58.200]  the peak of the Renaissance in the 1750s and 60s and into the 70s there was
[38:58.200 --> 39:02.120]  rebellion across England across Europe against the monarchs and against the
[39:02.120 --> 39:11.120]  church and Adam Weishaupt at Ingolstadt University who was a Jesuit you can
[39:11.120 --> 39:15.780]  argue who infiltrated who it's just a fact just like the new Pope once open
[39:15.780 --> 39:19.760]  borders except not at the Vatican they have 200 foot walls but to be him he
[39:19.760 --> 39:25.560]  wants borders open here he's gonna come pray at our border because he's a good
[39:25.560 --> 39:33.560]  guy well they wanted no borders no religion no nothing and so the Jesuit
[39:33.560 --> 39:39.040]  look it up created the Illuminati which was really it was called the
[39:39.040 --> 39:43.720]  Enlightenment in Europe before that the Renaissance it was led by Christians who
[39:43.720 --> 39:49.720]  were non-denominational and it was led by mystery school folks that weren't
[39:49.720 --> 39:57.720]  into dark occult stuff but just it's a fact but we're into esoteric empowerment
[39:57.720 --> 40:03.320]  of humanity and the Illuminati came in to overplay that and to infiltrate that
[40:03.320 --> 40:08.080]  and to take that over that this is in the Illuminati's writings and Washington
[40:08.080 --> 40:12.120]  wrote about it and said we must stop them and they did stop them here so for
[40:12.120 --> 40:17.800]  any real revolution against tyranny there's going to be a counterfeit and
[40:17.800 --> 40:26.640]  Bernie Sanders is that counterfeit so is Hillary Clinton now after they have a
[40:26.640 --> 40:30.000]  decade reign of terror what they normally do is get rid of communism
[40:30.000 --> 40:35.600]  before they officially launched it with Marx and Ingalls when it was just the
[40:35.600 --> 40:42.000]  Illuminati before they have a reign of terror then they bring in a strong
[40:42.000 --> 40:46.160]  man like Napoleon Bonaparte that's their model now you ask well why they keep the
[40:46.160 --> 40:48.960]  Soviet Union there for 70 something years because they hadn't taken over
[40:48.960 --> 40:52.840]  other countries yet they were using it as a base of operations in the program
[40:52.840 --> 40:59.320]  for exploitation of that population for the cultural military religious invasion
[40:59.320 --> 41:08.320]  of the next so communism is a system of conquest financed by the royal houses of
[41:08.320 --> 41:15.840]  Europe and by the Vatican from my research as best you can tell to overthrow
[41:15.840 --> 41:21.160]  and defeat real revolutions everywhere and to bring in a total world
[41:21.160 --> 41:32.040]  dictatorship with these elites at the top exempt from all loss and I'm not
[41:32.040 --> 41:36.560]  saying this is a Catholic conspiracy or a Jewish conspiracy it's a satanic
[41:36.560 --> 41:40.120]  conspiracy where it takes over the Vatican it takes over the Rothschilds
[41:40.120 --> 41:44.120]  it takes over the Jewish orders it takes over the Protestant orders it takes
[41:44.120 --> 41:47.720]  over the black groups the white groups this is how it controls is getting into
[41:47.720 --> 41:52.960]  all the groups I'm gonna get more into this into the news but this is a big big
[41:52.960 --> 41:57.640]  deal we have a Hillary super delegate thank you we're gonna bring me on a
[41:57.640 --> 42:00.880]  sheet of paper on that please thank you you may have I just don't see it here
[42:00.880 --> 42:08.640]  admitting we're gonna premiere this here in a moment that it doesn't matter how
[42:08.640 --> 42:13.600]  people vote this she's got the super delegates nationwide she's gonna be put
[42:13.600 --> 42:21.160]  into the nomination it's going to happen this is the arrogance and then they
[42:21.160 --> 42:27.000]  argue that it's the Constitution no this didn't happen till 1972 this is the
[42:27.000 --> 42:37.760]  Democratic Party again that did this now that said about strong men in their
[42:37.760 --> 42:45.720]  final communist takeover they won't call it communism it's globalism and then
[42:45.720 --> 42:55.480]  they will put strong men in after the takeover face and believe me to all the
[42:55.480 --> 42:58.000]  little socials of stuff out there you're not gonna be getting anything free
[42:58.000 --> 43:01.960]  you fools under this system that really if you had to call it anything as
[43:01.960 --> 43:05.800]  fascist and that's what the corporate Randers have done they have labeled
[43:05.800 --> 43:10.160]  Bernie Sanders socialist Hillary progressive socialist and you've got
[43:10.160 --> 43:12.920]  your two choices there when they're bought and paid for by the same interest
[43:12.920 --> 43:17.520]  and yes Bernie could say I'm not bought and paid for on record by these groups
[43:17.520 --> 43:27.680]  but his ideology comes directly out of them on record and everything they do
[43:27.680 --> 43:32.120]  you want to know what's happening study the French Revolution everything they
[43:32.120 --> 43:36.200]  did in the French Revolution is what they're doing now killing the fathers
[43:36.200 --> 43:42.520]  breaking up the families engaged in all manner of evil enslaving people banning
[43:42.520 --> 43:47.840]  words I mean these folks want to abolish reality they want to play God they
[43:47.840 --> 43:52.400]  want to trample and be trampled upon a society that it's cruel and more wicked
[43:52.400 --> 43:59.560]  to quote George Arwell who was at the top of the Fabian socialist MI6 OSS
[43:59.560 --> 44:04.840]  before that British secret police before that came from an elite technocrat
[44:04.840 --> 44:11.480]  family warning you you want to know the future it's a boot stomping on the human
[44:11.480 --> 44:16.760]  face forever going to Joe Biggs or from I appreciate him coming in here because
[44:16.760 --> 44:21.560]  part of this was his idea he really helped popularize the Hillary for
[44:21.560 --> 44:27.120]  prison shirt unlike anyone else on our team and I appreciate that and the shirt
[44:27.120 --> 44:31.120]  basically sold out there's a few sizes left the original so he said you ought
[44:31.120 --> 44:34.160]  to make a new one because that was a limited edition so it's totally
[44:34.160 --> 44:37.600]  different looking totally different angle now the other looks like an
[44:37.600 --> 44:41.480]  official election shirt till you read it closely so folks want to get in the fight
[44:41.480 --> 44:44.400]  will you till they see it's a joke and then they buy you a beer is that the
[44:44.400 --> 44:48.720]  bigs a couple times but I so I said let's just do one as a joker then let's
[44:48.720 --> 44:55.720]  bring that back what difference does it make and it's her as the joker on the
[44:55.720 --> 45:00.800]  front arch criminal and then on the right shoulder it says info wars calm and on
[45:00.800 --> 45:04.960]  the back if Joe turns around thank you Joe it says Hillary for prison so it's
[45:04.960 --> 45:09.720]  like the front of the old shirt and beyond so Hillary for prison 2016 and
[45:09.720 --> 45:15.520]  beyond that's my line info wars calm our great graphics crew came up with that
[45:15.520 --> 45:19.520]  and so again if you get the shirts it supports the broadcast gets the truth
[45:19.520 --> 45:24.560]  out and then you can go to these events Hillary event Trump events whatever and
[45:24.560 --> 45:28.680]  it really helps educate the public and really helps push this meme this meme is
[45:28.680 --> 45:32.600]  now popping up all over the place and I never take credit for stuff that isn't
[45:32.600 --> 45:36.880]  mine I saw a few of these bumper stickers about a year ago and then I saw
[45:36.880 --> 45:41.160]  one you know about six months before we got the shirt and I said we've got to
[45:41.160 --> 45:43.720]  come up with something like that so somebody else had the idea but we've
[45:43.720 --> 45:47.800]  really popularized it and pushed it you have popularized it you have pushed it
[45:47.800 --> 45:52.720]  your purchase funds the broadcast this is a limited edition we are selling this
[45:52.720 --> 45:59.680]  shirt until the election okay so you got you know up until November and then
[45:59.680 --> 46:03.520]  that's it a limited edition what difference does it make info wars calm
[46:03.520 --> 46:06.240]  what difference does it make if she's gets orders from biller burr group and
[46:06.240 --> 46:09.120]  Kissinger what difference does it make if they ship guns to Mexico to blame the
[46:09.120 --> 46:12.720]  Second Amendment what difference does it make if she's gets more Wall Street
[46:12.720 --> 46:15.800]  money than anybody else but tells you she's against Wall Street and then
[46:15.800 --> 46:19.240]  scapegoats all of Wall Street when it's the select top doing it Joe Biggs what
[46:19.240 --> 46:24.400]  do you think of the new shirt I like it I mean any opportunity that I can have to
[46:24.400 --> 46:30.040]  go out there and show people and engage in conversation about this person about
[46:30.040 --> 46:34.880]  this evil human being I'm all for it you know when I was at shot show in Vegas I
[46:34.880 --> 46:38.720]  was wearing that Hillary for prison t-shirt and to see the smiles on people's
[46:38.720 --> 46:43.280]  faces to see the military react to see these operators that have been to
[46:43.280 --> 46:47.920]  Benghazi you know to have been in that you know that atmosphere to know how to
[46:47.920 --> 46:51.840]  operate and work under someone like that how hard it is how difficult it is the
[46:51.840 --> 46:55.760]  fact that she left people there didn't give him any help lying about the emails
[46:55.760 --> 47:00.160]  lying about everything saying worse than worse than Brian Williams saying she's
[47:00.160 --> 47:03.680]  you know the planes being shot up on the ground they're attacking chose her
[47:03.680 --> 47:07.320]  getting off blue skies nothing happened she's a total fraud and like you were
[47:07.320 --> 47:10.320]  talking about earlier with her pants suit thing that looked you know a
[47:10.320 --> 47:14.160]  communist you know I made a meme that ended up being like the top meme to
[47:14.160 --> 47:18.160]  Democrat bait debates ago and I put pants to warehouse you're gonna like the
[47:18.160 --> 47:22.080]  way your dictator looks I guarantee it and I had Kim Jong-un and I had Hillary
[47:22.080 --> 47:25.840]  Clinton spliced together sitting there side-by-side I didn't even know you did
[47:25.840 --> 47:29.520]  that so so you noticed that too oh exactly they're wearing actual North
[47:29.520 --> 47:34.360]  Korea or Communist Party China a silk outfit that's exactly what it is I mean
[47:34.360 --> 47:38.680]  what is the message in that I mean yeah I mean I think like you said it's for
[47:38.680 --> 47:42.000]  these other leaders across the pond to kind of go you know what I think she is
[47:42.000 --> 47:45.880]  gonna be on our side we want we want to back this person you know what was it
[47:45.880 --> 47:49.880]  the debate last night the moderator was even a dough a donor for the Clinton
[47:49.880 --> 47:53.680]  Foundation that those moderators never even asked Hillary Clinton about the
[47:53.680 --> 47:56.560]  Clinton Foundation they never even delved into that but she always talks
[47:56.560 --> 47:59.560]  about how she's a feminist she's pro-women and yet she takes money from Saudi
[47:59.560 --> 48:03.320]  Arabia which completely demonizes demoralizes women but look we know
[48:03.320 --> 48:07.800]  Hillary's evil but what about the women that say girl power I don't care if she
[48:07.800 --> 48:11.680]  cheats I don't care if she lies she's a woman and then I've even heard
[48:11.680 --> 48:16.960]  Democrats going well super delegates are gonna vote for for Hillary even if you
[48:16.960 --> 48:20.880]  know Sanders wins by 30 points 20 points in New Hampshire doesn't matter we're
[48:20.880 --> 48:25.840]  gonna do it for her and they get off on the weird power of stealing someone's
[48:25.840 --> 48:30.160]  vote because they think because the party changed the rule it's okay it's like
[48:30.160 --> 48:34.440]  Hitler said I'm allowed to shoot Jews in the head so it's okay or Stalin said
[48:34.440 --> 48:38.200]  I'm allowed you know to arrest these farmers so it's okay and I'm not saying
[48:38.200 --> 48:42.280]  they're Nazis or they're communists but that's where that goes this attitude of
[48:42.280 --> 48:47.200]  my team is gonna crack some heads and take some people's rights so it's okay
[48:47.200 --> 48:53.240]  socialism is a step towards communism used to they wouldn't say they were
[48:53.240 --> 48:56.800]  socialist when we know they're communist now they say they're socialist and Time
[48:56.800 --> 49:01.160]  Magazine says we're all socialist now there's no such thing as socialism it's
[49:01.160 --> 49:05.840]  social engineers it's elites controlling the money they get rich and powerful off
[49:05.840 --> 49:12.000]  of it our problem is rigged economies rigged stock markets rigged megabanks
[49:12.000 --> 49:18.200]  above the law corporations like Google and Apple and Microsoft and General
[49:18.200 --> 49:23.280]  Electric who pay between zero and 3% taxes and they write the laws and then
[49:23.280 --> 49:28.360]  lecture us all day Joe Beggs that the middle class isn't paying enough taxes
[49:28.360 --> 49:32.880]  they call a rich person someone making a hundred and twenty thousand dollars a
[49:32.880 --> 49:37.920]  year brother okay that's who their class warfaring on knowing that somebody
[49:37.920 --> 49:42.120]  making 30 grand yeah that seems rich to them I mean it's so sick how they play
[49:42.120 --> 49:45.920]  on the public's ignorance well Hillary Clinton's also for women in combat she's
[49:45.920 --> 49:49.800]  also for the draft she's also for that and people go well you know women should
[49:49.800 --> 49:54.200]  have the right to join the military think about this a woman has the right to
[49:54.200 --> 49:57.120]  be in the military yes but think about this when you go when you place that
[49:57.120 --> 50:00.360]  woman in the combat what's gonna happen she's gonna fight a man who's gonna be
[50:00.360 --> 50:04.040]  200 pounds or larger they're not gonna have any sympathy for that woman and
[50:04.040 --> 50:08.440]  they're gonna stomp her head in that's what's gonna happen and she's all about
[50:08.440 --> 50:11.640]  that she wants to empower women so to say and see I can't believe we have to
[50:11.640 --> 50:15.360]  explain that no one's ever put women in frontline combat because it's a disaster
[50:15.360 --> 50:19.960]  when they try and people think that all we're being sexist you know we're not
[50:19.960 --> 50:23.800]  feminist we're not they've been taught all these little phony women's rights but
[50:23.800 --> 50:26.160]  they don't understand how about not to have glyphosate putting all your water
[50:26.160 --> 50:29.560]  ladies and have the highest cancer rates in the world here in America we're gonna
[50:29.560 --> 50:32.560]  skip this network break we're gonna skip this break I forgot to tell folks I
[50:32.560 --> 50:35.600]  want to shift gears into this super delicate story you're absolutely right
[50:35.600 --> 50:40.200]  Joe and it's about enslaving women it's about making them work it's about
[50:40.200 --> 50:44.040]  saying motherhood isn't good shaming them so they can be slaves of the system
[50:44.040 --> 50:47.560]  by the time they're 40 figure out they wanted to have kids and then by then it's
[50:47.560 --> 50:51.600]  too late for them it's about conning them it's about breaking up the family it's a
[50:51.600 --> 50:56.280]  trap and the system admits it what do you do when you're trying to eradicate
[50:56.280 --> 51:02.360]  fire ants or screw worms or any species you target the females you target them
[51:02.360 --> 51:06.360]  you in their reproduction that's all they've done is soft kill you Joe begs
[51:06.360 --> 51:09.840]  final comments on the new t-shirt like I said it's great I hope everyone goes out
[51:09.840 --> 51:13.520]  and gets it you will see me in numerous places popping up on TV here and there I
[51:13.520 --> 51:17.280]  will have the shirt on I'll have it with me everywhere I go I want to see
[51:17.280 --> 51:21.080]  everyone out there at least go and get one and show your support for info wars
[51:21.080 --> 51:25.800]  and your distaste and at the end of the day the fact that all of us can agree we
[51:25.800 --> 51:29.360]  just this woman does not need to be the president and again she has her goons
[51:29.360 --> 51:39.240]  call up top comedian facilities and tell them you will not make fun of Hillary
[51:39.240 --> 51:43.080]  or we're gonna shut you down that's that's what they do the comedy clubs
[51:43.080 --> 51:46.280]  that shows who they are and and what they want to do they want to tell us how

[51:50.800 --> 51:55.080]  words we can't use because they're our bosses these people are cult programmers

[51:58.720 --> 52:02.400]  at the high school we're at the college let the globalist and tyrants try to

[52:17.800 --> 52:23.520]  spontaneous great job crew getting him in here so quickly now I want to get into
[52:23.520 --> 52:27.960]  all this news we have Lou Rockwell in the third hour or the original
[52:27.960 --> 52:32.200]  libertarians out there and then we're also going to obviously have the fourth
[52:32.200 --> 52:35.560]  hour we'll tell you more about that there is so much to get into on global
[52:35.560 --> 52:40.480]  stocks look at these headlines global stocks continue to crash as oil plummets
[52:40.480 --> 52:45.080]  and gold skyrockets we're gonna be getting into that we're gonna get into
[52:45.080 --> 52:48.960]  the whole delegate process and the fact the public scratch in their head going
[52:48.960 --> 52:54.720]  a minute Sanders gets 20 points more than her in New Hampshire but he then
[52:54.720 --> 53:00.800]  gets two less delegates well yeah and Hillary flips the coin six times and it
[53:00.800 --> 53:05.640]  always comes up heads so she won does anyone believe that but in this case
[53:05.640 --> 53:08.880]  they're not even denying it's a fraud they go yeah we changed the rules
[53:08.880 --> 53:14.120]  Democratic Party did for our party in and it's a club and you ain't in it
[53:14.120 --> 53:18.520]  folks even if you think you are to where it doesn't matter we will choose with
[53:18.520 --> 53:23.920]  superdelegates appointed by the party bosses it's like the Communist
[53:23.920 --> 53:28.400]  Politburo in China complete with her wearing a little silk outfit that
[53:28.400 --> 53:32.360]  Mal's wife wore at every debate a pink one a gray one a yellow one they're
[53:32.360 --> 53:37.840]  wearing communist silk outfits with Politburo's that control everything and
[53:37.840 --> 53:43.200]  Hillary doing nothing but making communist gestures and communist slogans I
[53:43.200 --> 53:49.000]  mean we are entering the twilight zone here now Matt joins us one of our
[53:49.000 --> 53:54.440]  incredible camera folks he was obviously in New Hampshire with Richard Reeves
[53:54.440 --> 53:59.440]  covering all this talk to a super delegate from California Chico
[53:59.440 --> 54:03.480]  California while he was out there in New Hampshire and we're gonna premiere this
[54:03.480 --> 54:07.920]  video right now here for you that they've got hours of bombshell stuff I
[54:07.920 --> 54:10.880]  mean it's like that Jeb Bush thing was about to hit the cutting room floor
[54:10.880 --> 54:14.720]  where he's making fun of 9-11 victims I mean just sensational stuff that they
[54:14.720 --> 54:19.280]  have gotten so great job to Matt and Richard Matt so much to talk about here
[54:19.280 --> 54:26.160]  tell us about this guy Bob Valholland who wants to take Hillary I guess to
[54:26.160 --> 54:29.120]  Valholla where they all dance around little little little mousy tongue
[54:29.120 --> 54:33.680]  outfits I mean this is twilight zone on PCP describe this clip before we go to
[54:33.680 --> 54:40.080]  it yeah well I was with Richard Reeves we were at the famous red-arrowed diner
[54:40.080 --> 54:45.880]  where you know a lot of people will go to get food but also talk about politics
[54:45.880 --> 54:50.680]  very open atmosphere great place and actually wound up running into a lot
[54:50.680 --> 54:54.160]  of infowars listeners but wait a minute that was something that hurt someone's
[54:54.160 --> 54:59.160]  feelings is that allowed would the police arrest you like UT not there no
[54:59.160 --> 55:03.080]  actually people are willing to get in some pretty heated arguments so that
[55:03.080 --> 55:07.480]  was pretty cool it was actually really refreshing so yeah well we wound up
[55:07.480 --> 55:11.920]  running into a Superdelegate Bob if you guys want to know what a hipster looks
[55:11.920 --> 55:16.720]  like when they turn 70 that'd be this guy and he is a Hillary fan he's
[55:16.720 --> 55:21.800]  committed to Hillary and he basically gave us the inside baseball as to how
[55:21.800 --> 55:26.680]  the Superdelegates work in the Democratic Party now these guys are on
[55:26.680 --> 55:30.800]  power trips I mean I love how they're just openly admitted and then mainstream
[55:30.800 --> 55:34.960]  media goes really because the public's getting so upset about this it's finally
[55:34.960 --> 55:40.320]  capturing their imagination to go yes you win the NASCAR race by five lengths
[55:40.320 --> 55:45.200]  and then someone else gets it because they made the rules up I mean this is a
[55:45.200 --> 55:49.400]  total joke but notice how they're hiding it in plain view notice now how they just
[55:49.400 --> 55:53.040]  put the whole thing out there yeah your kids belong to us yeah we're coming with
[55:53.040 --> 55:57.840]  force inoculations and it doesn't matter how you vote yeah and the other thing is
[55:57.840 --> 56:02.720]  that you know this process wasn't originally meant to be this way they're
[56:02.720 --> 56:09.560]  kind of gaming the system Superdelegates were used they used to be tiebreakers
[56:09.560 --> 56:13.960]  essentially and right now most of them are committed to Hillary Clinton and he
[56:13.960 --> 56:17.880]  explains that even the ones who are uncommitted are really going for Hillary
[56:17.880 --> 56:21.960]  Clinton and I think this would be the appropriate time to go to the clip here
[56:21.960 --> 56:25.120]  we go this is him being out in the open he's a worshipper of Hillary he's a
[56:25.120 --> 56:28.560]  Superdelegate and he doesn't matter what your vote says he's he's the boss here
[56:28.560 --> 56:34.840]  is we're here at the Red Arrow diner and we've gone further down the bar here and
[56:34.840 --> 56:38.880]  we found this gentleman what's your name Bob Mulholland from Chico, California I'm
[56:38.880 --> 56:43.480]  a DNC member that's a Superdelegate to the National Convention wow so that's
[56:43.480 --> 56:46.240]  first time I can think of that I've talked with the Democratic Superdelegate
[56:46.240 --> 56:49.840]  tell us how long have you been a Superdelegate how long have you been
[56:49.840 --> 56:52.840]  delegate well and tell us a little bit more about the process of how you get to
[56:52.840 --> 56:56.960]  be a Superdelegate there's several ways but I this will be my 11th National
[56:56.960 --> 57:01.920]  Convention I've been a Superdelegate since 1992 in our case in California you
[57:01.920 --> 57:05.080]  have to get elected by the California Democratic Party to be on the DNC
[57:05.080 --> 57:09.200]  obviously Democratic governors are automatic Superdelegates so
[57:09.200 --> 57:13.160]  understandably that it sounds like Hillary is gonna have a huge edge when
[57:13.160 --> 57:17.840]  it comes to Superdelegates is that correct oh yeah and former DNC chairs
[57:17.840 --> 57:21.680]  like Howard Dean who's from Vermont he's known Bernie for decades he's for
[57:21.680 --> 57:26.360]  Hillary yeah the people who have worked with Hillary for decades are big
[57:26.360 --> 57:30.280]  supporters of her if they haven't said so yet they're gonna they will over
[57:30.280 --> 57:34.080]  the next several weeks so roughly when it comes to the Democratic National
[57:34.080 --> 57:38.360]  Convention what is the rough total of delegates that are going to be available
[57:38.360 --> 57:45.800]  for the DNC right now about 4,800 so you need about almost 2,400 to get the
[57:45.800 --> 57:50.960]  nomination and the way we work is that anybody who gets 15% more in election
[57:50.960 --> 57:54.920]  gets delegates so this election will go all the way to California standards will
[57:54.920 --> 57:57.640]  end up with well over a thousand delegates and Hillary will get the
[57:57.640 --> 58:04.200]  nomination okay now the superdelegates are basically what Hillary pretty much
[58:04.200 --> 58:08.320]  already has in her pocket how many how many delegates is that about 750 delegates
[58:08.320 --> 58:12.400]  my guess is she probably has half of them committed to her but she's out there
[58:12.400 --> 58:16.440]  working the precincts and working the states every day for every vote and
[58:16.440 --> 58:22.880]  March 1st is super Tuesday at the end of the day you will see that Hillary has the
[58:22.880 --> 58:28.800]  most delegates of regular people from caucuses like Iowa from New Hampshire
[58:28.800 --> 58:34.880]  primaries Nevada South Carolina and then all those states on March 1st we'll be
[58:34.880 --> 58:39.680]  back stay with us thank you for listening and see for them it's just business as

[1:00:01.840 --> 1:00:06.720]  show because there's a war on for your mind
[1:00:06.720 --> 1:00:18.200]  all right getting back to this Hillary super delegate that Matt and Richard our
[1:00:18.200 --> 1:00:23.160]  reporters were able to interview out of New Hampshire at the Red Arrow restaurant
[1:00:23.160 --> 1:00:27.400]  and barb I don't know why he'd want to come into a libertarian style facility
[1:00:27.400 --> 1:00:31.040]  that it's well known for being when I mean the Democrats want free speech
[1:00:31.040 --> 1:00:34.680]  banned I mean and I've got a whole stack of news on that coming up in the next
[1:00:34.680 --> 1:00:38.600]  segment just to illustrate the fact that these are totalitarians now this guy
[1:00:38.600 --> 1:00:45.280]  thinks it's completely normal to say Hillary is out recruiting the delegates
[1:00:45.280 --> 1:00:51.240]  and the super delegates that are elected by the Democratic Party leadership
[1:00:51.240 --> 1:00:56.760]  you understand that's the communist system it's like in the EU they have an
[1:00:56.760 --> 1:01:02.080]  elected parliament the Nigel Farage and others are part of and his party's
[1:01:02.080 --> 1:01:08.240]  taking it over the EU bureaucracy is unelected and it gets better exempts
[1:01:08.240 --> 1:01:14.840]  itself from EU taxes and why not why not why not have TPP be writing our laws
[1:01:14.840 --> 1:01:21.280]  in secret why not have Bernie Sanders as they've now announced first they're
[1:01:21.280 --> 1:01:25.120]  like he may not win even if he wins well now it's tied well now she's getting
[1:01:25.120 --> 1:01:29.880]  two more delegates well maybe more yeah right up to election day or right up to
[1:01:29.880 --> 1:01:36.520]  the nomination they can just go did you hear Bernie didn't get any next because
[1:01:36.520 --> 1:01:40.280]  we don't follow the popular vote and this is just like the 17th Amendment
[1:01:40.280 --> 1:01:45.320]  getting rid of US senators before they were elected by the legislature of the
[1:01:45.320 --> 1:01:48.920]  state that way they were controlled by the state this is the reverse of that
[1:01:48.920 --> 1:01:53.280]  it's the party itself in control of everything and it's the Democrats that
[1:01:53.280 --> 1:01:59.240]  changed it in 1972 in their party Matt pretty amazing Joe Biggs makes the
[1:01:59.240 --> 1:02:03.680]  point that Bernie Sanders is all for redistribution women have been down
[1:02:03.680 --> 1:02:09.480]  trodden so isn't it fair that some of my delegates your votes were given to her
[1:02:09.480 --> 1:02:18.600]  see oh stealing isn't so nice now is it Bernie but bigger for me Matt is what's
[1:02:18.600 --> 1:02:21.800]  wrong with the Democrat supporters are they really this totalitarian what's
[1:02:21.800 --> 1:02:26.200]  your view on this well the cool thing about this is that you know this is
[1:02:26.200 --> 1:02:30.120]  really actually going to wake up a lot of people as to how the process really
[1:02:30.120 --> 1:02:34.640]  works when they see that Bernie is getting a lot of the popular vote and he
[1:02:34.640 --> 1:02:37.320]  winds up not getting the nomination they're gonna start scratching their
[1:02:37.320 --> 1:02:41.520]  heads they're gonna start demanding answers because these Bernie supporters
[1:02:41.520 --> 1:02:47.200]  are fired up we actually wound up when we were on our way to interview the
[1:02:47.200 --> 1:02:52.360]  deputy secretary of state in New Hampshire to figure out how the delegate
[1:02:52.360 --> 1:03:00.280]  process works for the Republican side we wound up running into precinct where
[1:03:00.280 --> 1:03:04.080]  Hillary supporters clash with Bernie supporters and let me tell you the
[1:03:04.080 --> 1:03:10.080]  Bernie supporters got rowdy so yeah they're pretty fired up and I think that
[1:03:10.080 --> 1:03:15.800]  really for him to pull this out he needs to get 60% wins pretty much across the
[1:03:15.800 --> 1:03:21.760]  board because if we take a look back when Hillary was going up against Obama
[1:03:21.760 --> 1:03:27.360]  she actually had more superdelegates in her pocket that time but Obama was
[1:03:27.360 --> 1:03:31.200]  crushing it so you know he wound up getting the nomination and that's the
[1:03:31.200 --> 1:03:36.760]  key is that when there's landslides they can't go against popular will stealing
[1:03:36.760 --> 1:03:40.400]  comes when things are close that's just how it works not just in our elections
[1:03:40.400 --> 1:03:44.480]  but others the system is still scared of the popular will but the fact that
[1:03:44.480 --> 1:03:48.520]  they're trying to float it now like if the delegate wants me that's just the
[1:03:48.520 --> 1:03:53.640]  way it is and no that is not the way it is and as much as I don't like Bernie
[1:03:53.640 --> 1:03:58.600]  Sanders I gotta say he's better than Hillary Clinton I mean I it's just
[1:03:58.600 --> 1:04:02.920]  socialism is so horrible I'm already basically owned by the government it
[1:04:02.920 --> 1:04:07.120]  treats me like a second-class citizen now I've got to be more owned by people
[1:04:07.120 --> 1:04:11.120]  and then it domesticates all these bots that want everything free and it
[1:04:11.120 --> 1:04:15.640]  destroys innovation what's your view of Bernie Sanders I mean again I mean not
[1:04:15.640 --> 1:04:20.920]  not as a reporter Matt Weber but just as a citizen yeah well you know I
[1:04:20.920 --> 1:04:25.640]  actually talked to my mom all the time and my stepbrother he is a huge Bernie
[1:04:25.640 --> 1:04:29.960]  Sanders fan and they my my parents don't get along with him because you know
[1:04:29.960 --> 1:04:33.440]  they're they're having these arguments it's really funny he thinks that you
[1:04:33.440 --> 1:04:36.480]  know tuition is gonna be free but it's funny because if you take a look at
[1:04:36.480 --> 1:04:40.280]  Sweden you know how their school system works you know that's the big point for
[1:04:40.280 --> 1:04:43.400]  him is free tuition free tuition free tuition it's like hey man I paid for my
[1:04:43.400 --> 1:04:48.400]  college I don't want to pay for years but he the deal is there Sweden they've
[1:04:48.400 --> 1:04:52.120]  got free tuition but when you look at all the fees that go along with going to
[1:04:52.120 --> 1:04:56.760]  school my mom and a whole instead of Rick come back and talk about this new
[1:04:56.760 --> 1:05:01.000]  plan for home visits to check on parents government-appointed monitors will
[1:05:01.000 --> 1:05:05.040]  assess the upbringing of children the US Department of Education and the
[1:05:05.040 --> 1:05:08.680]  Department of Health and Human Services has published a draft document
[1:05:08.680 --> 1:05:13.120]  outlining a plan that will treat families as equal partners in the raising
[1:05:13.120 --> 1:05:17.200]  of children this opens the door for government intrusion at all levels as
[1:05:17.200 --> 1:05:22.160]  defined in the document family means all the people who play a role in a child's
[1:05:22.160 --> 1:05:26.400]  life and early childhood development government employees will intervene to
[1:05:26.400 --> 1:05:31.200]  provide monitoring goals for children at home and the classroom if parents fail
[1:05:31.200 --> 1:05:35.640]  to meet the standard set evidence-based parenting interventions will be made to
[1:05:35.640 --> 1:05:40.200]  ensure that children's social emotional and behavioral needs are met the
[1:05:40.200 --> 1:05:44.240]  program will undoubtedly increase the likelihood of teenagers being given
[1:05:44.240 --> 1:05:48.840]  dangerous antidepressant drugs a common theme of collectivist thinking is the
[1:05:48.840 --> 1:05:52.760]  idea that children belong not just to their parents but to the state
[1:05:52.760 --> 1:05:55.640]  Leanne McAdoo reporting for info wars dot com

[1:08:28.360 --> 1:08:34.440]  my friends thank you for joining us the United States has been captured by far
[1:08:34.440 --> 1:08:39.040]  and offshore banks who are bringing in a form of scientific social control and
[1:08:39.040 --> 1:08:43.720]  establishing a planetary oligarchy for the ultra rich to be above the law with
[1:08:43.720 --> 1:08:50.040]  diplomatic immunity they use dumbing down education systems and socialism at
[1:08:50.040 --> 1:08:55.680]  the lower levels to domesticate the population but above it they are exempt
[1:08:55.680 --> 1:08:59.640]  from their own horrors and in the process once the public's been
[1:08:59.640 --> 1:09:03.520]  sufficiently dumbed down which has happened once the public doesn't know
[1:09:03.520 --> 1:09:06.480]  what planet they're on once the public doesn't know the three branches of
[1:09:06.480 --> 1:09:11.140]  government they can then start attacking free speech itself and we're
[1:09:11.140 --> 1:09:14.880]  gonna get into that and we actually have the video I want to play some of it the
[1:09:14.880 --> 1:09:21.120]  article is up on info wars.com at the University of Texas in Austin there is
[1:09:21.120 --> 1:09:24.440]  a street preacher been going out there for years reading out of the Bible
[1:09:24.440 --> 1:09:27.960]  against homosexuality whether you agree with that or not and here come the
[1:09:27.960 --> 1:09:30.720]  police and then they start writing the tickets and they start threatening to
[1:09:30.720 --> 1:09:36.000]  arrest him and they say because you offended someone they can now define
[1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:41.880]  obscenity not as handing out hustlers to high school kids or burying your
[1:09:41.880 --> 1:09:48.560]  breasts or whatever but as hurting someone's feelings and I've got stacks
[1:09:48.560 --> 1:09:54.200]  of those articles today people being arrested fined in Europe for saying not
[1:09:54.200 --> 1:09:59.160]  since the Nazi invasion of France have we faced such an onslaught with the
[1:09:59.160 --> 1:10:03.320]  Muslim waves boom you're arrested
[1:10:03.960 --> 1:10:11.560]  boom and I've got stacks of articles here you know San Diego banning the word
[1:10:11.560 --> 1:10:16.880]  founding fathers here's what I want to tell you there's not a globalist
[1:10:16.880 --> 1:10:24.920]  revolution coming we are in it now they are launching on all fronts they're not
[1:10:24.920 --> 1:10:29.000]  gonna tell you it's the biggest all but it's gonna be like oh yeah it's no big
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:33.760]  deal your kids belong to the state now I'm gonna cover that that's the federal
[1:10:33.760 --> 1:10:38.280]  government saying that and we knew this was coming because it's been done in
[1:10:38.280 --> 1:10:42.360]  Europe it's been done in England they started in England five years ago and in
[1:10:42.360 --> 1:10:48.080]  Scotland and in Ireland it's the exact same global UNESCO agenda 21 global
[1:10:48.080 --> 1:10:52.720]  treaty and folks they don't care we didn't sign that tree we're under it
[1:10:52.720 --> 1:10:58.920]  UNESCO calls the shots people say all the UN doesn't run us the big
[1:10:58.920 --> 1:11:03.160]  robber barons created the UN the Rockefellers gave them the land to
[1:11:03.160 --> 1:11:07.320]  transfer our power to the multinational organizations and then have them dictate
[1:11:07.320 --> 1:11:13.680]  back to us just like TPP they finally released it after it was globally
[1:11:13.680 --> 1:11:20.680]  ratified secret for years and it's everything we warned global taxes the
[1:11:20.680 --> 1:11:25.880]  elites above the law tax exemption diplomatic immunity for big banks
[1:11:25.880 --> 1:11:31.880]  but multinationals can shut down your farm if they claim it competes with them
[1:11:31.880 --> 1:11:40.240]  I mean just crazy stuff thousands of pages so nightmarish I can't believe it
[1:11:40.240 --> 1:11:45.600]  I mean really what I keep saying here is the magnitude of what we face is its
[1:11:45.600 --> 1:11:51.120]  greatest weakness and its greatest strength the magnitude that they go on
[1:11:51.120 --> 1:11:54.920]  singing in and Fox News and go and the London Guardian we can show you that
[1:11:54.920 --> 1:12:00.840]  article it doesn't matter a Bernie won by 20 points the super delegates are for
[1:12:00.840 --> 1:12:08.200]  Hillary and so she got more delegates in New Hampshire think about how sick that
[1:12:08.200 --> 1:12:14.960]  is and then we go talk to one of the super delegates and he's very proud I
[1:12:14.960 --> 1:12:20.920]  played the whole clip probably just a second of it here now interviewed by
[1:12:20.920 --> 1:12:23.680]  Matt Weber and Richard Reeves our reporters who were on the ground in
[1:12:23.680 --> 1:12:29.440]  New Hampshire they're back now and he's just like yes I've been for decades for
[1:12:29.440 --> 1:12:36.240]  Hillary I like her and she likes us and we decide she wins he just I decide the
[1:12:36.240 --> 1:12:42.240]  party you know the party has to decide who gets it and we kind of run things
[1:12:42.240 --> 1:12:50.160]  and I was elected by our party and so I decide you know I run things that's the
[1:12:50.160 --> 1:12:54.440]  same attitude we're not gonna let you have your families mommy and daddy
[1:12:54.440 --> 1:12:59.580]  anymore we're gonna make you take shots oh yeah oh and you know the
[1:12:59.580 --> 1:13:03.600]  president he's gonna come after your guns with an executive order oh and you
[1:13:03.600 --> 1:13:05.840]  know we're gonna open the border up even though federal law says you can't do
[1:13:05.840 --> 1:13:08.560]  that and we're just gonna do it with secret orders and when the border
[1:13:08.560 --> 1:13:13.880]  patrol comes out we're gonna indict them for whistleblowing on crime and we're
[1:13:13.880 --> 1:13:16.560]  gonna just call you racist I mean imagine if I was at the Mexican border
[1:13:16.560 --> 1:13:20.720]  from Guatemala and I said you must let me enter your racist they would laugh at
[1:13:20.720 --> 1:13:22.920]  me
[1:13:28.320 --> 1:13:32.960]  I mean Mexican bureaucracy is amazing like if you're at a Mexican airport you
[1:13:32.960 --> 1:13:38.040]  board the plane 30 minutes before or they don't let you I've seen families
[1:13:38.040 --> 1:13:42.800]  saw it yesterday they clicked that thing I barely went through they clicked that
[1:13:42.800 --> 1:13:48.880]  deal and they said no and they enjoyed it and and that's just colonial
[1:13:48.880 --> 1:13:56.000]  bureaucracy that's how all of Latin America is the point though is that if I
[1:13:56.000 --> 1:14:01.360]  showed up in a Mexican hospital and I walked in with no money no credit cards
[1:14:01.360 --> 1:14:07.160]  no nothing they because this has been in the news they would let my wife have the
[1:14:07.160 --> 1:14:12.120]  kid there and the police would show up the next morning and say how are you
[1:14:12.120 --> 1:14:16.080]  gonna pay this and they would take you and put you in the back of a squad car
[1:14:16.080 --> 1:14:22.680]  and take you and lock you up in a jail and say Western Union buddy
[1:14:22.680 --> 1:14:31.680]  pay up hmm not here 10,000 Chinese women every couple weeks arriving and it's all
[1:14:31.680 --> 1:14:38.200]  advertised as free free free if you show up in China and ask for something free
[1:14:38.200 --> 1:14:46.280]  they will laugh at you in your face but this is what buffoons we've become and
[1:14:46.280 --> 1:14:50.720]  by the way the Mexicans don't owe me free health care because they'd have to
[1:14:50.720 --> 1:14:56.200]  steal it from somebody else you ever think about that that's why we agree
[1:14:56.200 --> 1:15:00.640]  government does like bridges and roads and the military and you got to watch it
[1:15:00.640 --> 1:15:03.960]  because nine times out of ten it ends up taking over your country historically
[1:15:03.960 --> 1:15:12.560]  look at Rome look at Germany this is all common sense and this is what I want to
[1:15:12.560 --> 1:15:17.800]  get down to Rob Jacobson made a great intro video a few years ago from a
[1:15:17.800 --> 1:15:23.320]  State Department Department of Defense joint training video for school kids
[1:15:23.320 --> 1:15:29.640]  about tyranny and how to recognize it and you know I think we ought to go find
[1:15:29.640 --> 1:15:33.640]  that full video he's got it back there we ordered from the one those
[1:15:33.640 --> 1:15:40.800]  government catalog sites a decade ago I was looking for videos on
[1:15:41.320 --> 1:15:48.040]  subversion and all sort of stuff to to put in a film but we got this other video
[1:15:48.040 --> 1:15:51.600]  when it was just hours of what school kids were shown on projectors about how
[1:15:51.600 --> 1:15:57.280]  to recognize tyranny you watch those I mean that's our government and that's
[1:15:57.280 --> 1:16:04.080]  what I'm getting at is these young people and I'm young but I'm 42 I'm I'm
[1:16:04.080 --> 1:16:08.280]  old compared to these people these young people have been brought up folks and
[1:16:08.280 --> 1:16:13.200]  they really believe watch what you say they really believe if you say I want
[1:16:13.200 --> 1:16:22.720]  to eat Chinese food they go Chinese languages hey you can't have a Mexican
[1:16:22.720 --> 1:16:30.920]  style party because it might offend somebody you you can't wear a cowboy
[1:16:30.920 --> 1:16:34.560]  hat or a geisha girl this is being done everywhere and then when the kids cry at
[1:16:34.560 --> 1:16:38.120]  Yale the kids they're adults but we call them kids now because it's a rest of
[1:16:38.120 --> 1:16:42.840]  development forever we go to Matt here in a moment
[1:16:42.840 --> 1:16:51.200]  and the girl and and and this mom go I told you I don't feel safe no Halloween
[1:16:51.200 --> 1:16:56.480]  parties parties you shouldn't have sent that email outside just let people have
[1:16:56.480 --> 1:17:05.680]  free speech no I can't stop it I mean that's what she actually does I mean
[1:17:05.680 --> 1:17:09.800]  you talk about basket case middle patients that's what they produced
[1:17:09.800 --> 1:17:19.480]  someone might wear a cowboy and Yale got rid of the professors they said
[1:17:19.480 --> 1:17:23.440]  absolutely get out of here you put an email out saying there's free speech in
[1:17:23.440 --> 1:17:26.840]  America get out of here by the way we're not authoritarian we're liberals now
[1:17:26.840 --> 1:17:34.640]  let's wear Mao outfits on TV I got stacks articles your kids belong to us look
[1:17:34.640 --> 1:17:45.560]  at this Department of Education has announced it I mean Matt we ran into
[1:17:45.560 --> 1:17:49.160]  the break there you were telling the story about your parents and said a
[1:17:49.160 --> 1:17:51.600]  cousin or something's a burning sport I forget he just thinks he's gonna get
[1:17:51.600 --> 1:17:54.960]  something free and you were pointing out that they always talk about Sweden or
[1:17:54.960 --> 1:17:58.480]  whatever how it's free but then you know you're paying like two or three times
[1:17:58.480 --> 1:18:02.560]  what we pay for college it's not free or I want to be like England where it's all
[1:18:02.560 --> 1:18:08.200]  free it's a hellish it they fly here for health care they're just so untraveled
[1:18:08.200 --> 1:18:16.960]  and so ignorant is that what you were getting at exactly yeah so I just can't
[1:18:16.960 --> 1:18:21.160]  work now tell me where's my outfits on TV we're screwed I'll get me out of here
[1:18:21.160 --> 1:18:25.560]  what is going on all the taxes and fees that you'll incur when you're going to
[1:18:25.560 --> 1:18:30.360]  school in Sweden is actually more than paying full tuition in the United States
[1:18:30.360 --> 1:18:36.960]  at a great college like watch you that's what my mom and my stepdad you know came
[1:18:36.960 --> 1:18:41.160]  to the conclusion of and he's he's an accountant he's a he's great with
[1:18:41.160 --> 1:18:50.280]  numbers and this guy loves to fact check so yeah what I what I see from Bernie
[1:18:50.280 --> 1:18:55.400]  Sanders a lot of good things campaign finance reform like yeah yeah and last
[1:18:55.400 --> 1:18:59.400]  night in the Democratic debate I caught some of the highlights you know how he
[1:18:59.400 --> 1:19:04.520]  called out Hillary Clinton for her donations no her donations from Wall
[1:19:04.520 --> 1:19:08.680]  Street he goes let's not insult the American public's intelligence stupid
[1:19:08.680 --> 1:19:15.280]  yeah exactly so and the last thing I guess I wanted to touch on on the whole
[1:19:15.280 --> 1:19:18.120]  free college thing is that you know you do have to move money around to be able
[1:19:18.120 --> 1:19:21.280]  to pay for that and a lot of that is going to come from corporate tax and I
[1:19:21.280 --> 1:19:24.680]  did hear report while I was on the road with Richard and one of the
[1:19:24.680 --> 1:19:30.400]  correspondents was explaining how you know college will be free but the thing
[1:19:30.400 --> 1:19:32.760]  is you're not gonna be able to find a job because they're gonna be scaling
[1:19:32.760 --> 1:19:37.320]  jobs back because of the higher tax rates oh yeah everybody everybody gets to
[1:19:37.320 --> 1:19:41.240]  go to college in Cuba yeah you can use your college degree to clean toilets
[1:19:41.240 --> 1:19:44.920]  yeah exactly you're gonna be educated but you're gonna be doing something like
[1:19:44.920 --> 1:19:48.440]  you know flipping patties so and again it's not gonna be in a classical true
[1:19:48.440 --> 1:19:51.320]  education they're gonna call it classical it's gonna be learning what
[1:19:51.320 --> 1:19:58.400]  words not to use and how to be you know compliant with trans tranny bathrooms
[1:19:58.400 --> 1:20:03.440]  or whatever I mean look education becomes indoctrination when it is all
[1:20:03.440 --> 1:20:09.360]  state-run they they teach you to love the state to you know adore the state to
[1:20:09.360 --> 1:20:15.400]  you know five plus five equals 11 12 whatever you know so I'll say this I'll
[1:20:15.400 --> 1:20:21.080]  say this I want to get film reels of real colleges in the 40s and 50s and 60s
[1:20:21.080 --> 1:20:27.440]  and and people in suits and sharp eyes and and and really smart and the IQ's
[1:20:27.440 --> 1:20:30.800]  have dropped everything it's not just looks and then go show college students
[1:20:30.800 --> 1:20:36.760]  today they look like night of the living dead of every race color and creed they
[1:20:36.760 --> 1:20:43.000]  are so vapid and empty and stupid like they were shot with a moron gun or
[1:20:43.000 --> 1:20:47.760]  something you know that mutates you into a jellyfish or something I mean you know
[1:20:47.760 --> 1:20:51.280]  did aliens land and then put worms in their brains and they're already taken
[1:20:51.280 --> 1:20:56.640]  over I mean I don't know I don't know but the television killed humanity don't
[1:20:56.640 --> 1:21:01.320]  you hate when you run into someone and they say I don't do politics and you
[1:21:01.320 --> 1:21:04.920]  kind of you're like you don't do what like you're not in politics or you don't
[1:21:04.920 --> 1:21:09.240]  I'm real smart I know how to sit real good I don't do politics I just but I do
[1:21:09.240 --> 1:21:15.920]  like Bernie Sanders and I want something free though blows my mind just the top
[1:21:15.920 --> 1:21:19.640]  off you know and it's like you you don't I mean you don't catch like clips in the
[1:21:19.640 --> 1:21:23.640]  news or you know because it's everywhere it's everywhere and you start talking to
[1:21:23.640 --> 1:21:28.480]  people and you know I actually I I don't date much but I did go on a date
[1:21:28.480 --> 1:21:33.640]  recently as well and I was talking to a girl and she was not having it and we
[1:21:33.640 --> 1:21:38.000]  ended it early because I started talking about politics too much so dating
[1:21:38.000 --> 1:21:43.600]  advice don't bring up politics on the first date well I mean how old are these
[1:21:43.600 --> 1:21:49.840]  women you're dating to about my age so how old are you 26 okay well so yeah
[1:21:49.840 --> 1:21:58.920]  that's a surprising but you know hey my experience you know it's it's it's hard
[1:21:58.920 --> 1:22:02.680]  to deal with all right buddy I appreciate you and Richard great job up there
[1:22:02.680 --> 1:22:07.360]  more clips and bombshell info coming up let's let's play that clip since I
[1:22:07.360 --> 1:22:11.000]  mentioned it again this is Bob how do you pronounce this guy
[1:22:11.000 --> 1:22:16.080]  Volhollin something like that from from Chico, California a super delegate
[1:22:16.080 --> 1:22:21.720]  bragging with his fealty is to Hillary period so he's the guy that gets the
[1:22:21.720 --> 1:22:26.360]  vote here it is Hillary is gonna have a huge edge when it comes to super
[1:22:26.360 --> 1:22:30.400]  delegates is that correct oh yeah and and former DNC chairs like Howard Dean
[1:22:30.400 --> 1:22:35.240]  who's from Vermont he's known Bernie for decades he's for Hillary yeah the people
[1:22:35.240 --> 1:22:39.400]  who have worked with Hillary for decades are big supporters of her if they
[1:22:39.400 --> 1:22:42.360]  haven't said so yet they're gonna they're they will over the next several
[1:22:42.360 --> 1:22:46.840]  weeks so roughly when it comes to the Democratic National Convention what is
[1:22:46.840 --> 1:22:52.360]  the rough total of delegates that are going to be available for the DNC right
[1:22:52.360 --> 1:22:58.520]  now about 4800 so you need about almost 2400 to get the nomination and the way
[1:22:58.520 --> 1:23:03.040]  we work is that anybody who gets 15 percent more in election gets delegates
[1:23:03.040 --> 1:23:06.680]  so this election will go all the way to California Sanders will end up with well
[1:23:06.680 --> 1:23:11.520]  over a thousand delegates and Hillary will get the nomination okay now the
[1:23:11.520 --> 1:23:15.800]  super delegates are basically what Hillary pretty much already has in her
[1:23:15.800 --> 1:23:19.680]  pocket how many how many delegates is that about 750 delegates my guess is
[1:23:19.680 --> 1:23:23.960]  she probably has half of them committed to her but she's out there working the
[1:23:23.960 --> 1:23:28.760]  precincts and working the states every day let's stop right there we're gonna
[1:23:28.760 --> 1:23:33.920]  put the full video up on info wars calm prison planet calm and because so much
[1:23:33.920 --> 1:23:37.280]  the public is still even ignorant about superdelegates and the Democratic Party
[1:23:37.280 --> 1:23:42.240]  changing this in 1972 we'll post some headlines from the London Guardian in
[1:23:42.240 --> 1:23:46.440]  places in case people think we're making this up because we talked to folks on
[1:23:46.440 --> 1:23:52.040]  the street Leanne McAdoo did and they went excuse me Bernie Sanders won by 20
[1:23:52.040 --> 1:23:55.120]  points but he gets less delegates because they're pledged to Hillary yeah
[1:23:55.120 --> 1:24:02.040]  that's how this works so that's what it comes down to and you can go read about
[1:24:02.040 --> 1:24:05.720]  superdelegates online here's the headline even if Sanders wins the popular
[1:24:05.720 --> 1:24:09.520]  vote Clinton could still get the nomination that is the London Guardian
[1:24:09.520 --> 1:24:14.160]  okay so people are having a lot of trouble wrapping their minds around this
[1:24:14.160 --> 1:24:21.040]  and I understand why because it's crazy and it's wrong but nevertheless it's
[1:24:21.040 --> 1:24:27.000]  going on now I do want to open the phones up after the break so that you can
[1:24:27.000 --> 1:24:32.160]  chime in on the election on the state of the world on the Russian Prime Minister
[1:24:32.160 --> 1:24:35.520]  Mediative if I'm pronouncing that right always have trouble with that even though
[1:24:35.520 --> 1:24:40.200]  he's been been covered for 10 years he should be president he and Putin kind of
[1:24:40.200 --> 1:24:45.280]  switch back and forth like two peas in a pod really he's just Putin's fill in sit
[1:24:45.280 --> 1:24:49.840]  in kind of like his vice president even when he's when he's president but to make
[1:24:49.840 --> 1:24:54.080]  a long story short he's talking about World War three and I noticed commenters
[1:24:54.080 --> 1:24:58.600]  on info wars.com with their troll pre-programmed deal we're like now
[1:24:58.600 --> 1:25:03.000]  Mediative is fear mongering and just like Alex Jones we're sick of all the
[1:25:03.000 --> 1:25:11.080]  fear mongering that's the Prime Minister of Russia they're in a proxy war
[1:25:11.080 --> 1:25:19.800]  against NATO in Syria and other areas and they're in a proxy war in Ukraine and
[1:25:19.800 --> 1:25:23.720]  Republicans and Democrats get up on the news they go let's bloody the nose the
[1:25:23.720 --> 1:25:27.440]  Russians let's kill some more of them we need more body bags these are all quotes
[1:25:27.440 --> 1:25:31.040]  from generals and people one of the top NATO generals came out last year and said
[1:25:31.040 --> 1:25:37.920]  it's time to have a war let's just have a war. I mean even a Napoleon and Hitler
[1:25:37.920 --> 1:25:46.760]  that were accomplished tacticians and military men both highly decorated were
[1:25:46.760 --> 1:25:51.400]  very secretive about major war operations and didn't shoot their mouths off and
[1:25:51.400 --> 1:25:54.480]  didn't say this is going to be easy or this or that and there weren't nuclear
[1:25:54.480 --> 1:26:01.000]  weapons then Napoleon had like the highest honors as a field captain you
[1:26:01.000 --> 1:26:05.720]  could get in France and so does Hitler he had basically the Congressional Medal
[1:26:05.720 --> 1:26:10.000]  of Honor that's how you can get a corporal that's when people follow him
[1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:13.040]  they just don't make that a big part of the history books they don't like to
[1:26:13.040 --> 1:26:16.320]  build Hitler up so what if the guy was a war hero in World War one he was still a
[1:26:16.320 --> 1:26:22.320]  lunatic the point was is these guys knew what they were doing compared to all the
[1:26:22.320 --> 1:26:27.880]  weird feminist crazies that go you're not nice to women Putin I'm going to show
[1:26:27.880 --> 1:26:31.920]  you never been in the military know nothing about it but they know how to
[1:26:31.920 --> 1:26:36.480]  act tough and walk around in
[1:26:37.000 --> 1:26:42.680]  $5,000 you know Versace dresses I mean I see these women looks like they're on
[1:26:42.680 --> 1:26:46.040]  the catwalk or something and they got their lipstick on they all kind of got
[1:26:46.040 --> 1:26:50.520]  their girlfriends or they're oh yeah we're gonna blow up Russia and it's just
[1:26:50.520 --> 1:26:52.020]  like do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do.
[1:26:52.020 --> 1:26:56.480]  Hillary's and Mao outfits every time now in communist outfits with communist
[1:26:56.480 --> 1:26:59.640]  slogans do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do
[1:26:59.640 --> 1:27:03.840]  do do do do do do do I mean when do we get off this and the feds are like the
[1:27:03.840 --> 1:27:08.200]  Bunnies threatened you know that the feds didn't stop taking property Americans
[1:27:08.200 --> 1:27:11.540]  have to stand up they're such terrorists let's lock up all the land rights people
[1:27:11.540 --> 1:27:15.040]  because we're you know the government follows the rules and we we do what's
[1:27:15.040 --> 1:27:24.540]  need. We're the good guys. And God help us. This country has been totally betrayed. And
[1:27:24.540 --> 1:27:33.840]  it is it. It is madness. The toll free number to join us is 800-2599-231-800-2599-231. First
[1:27:33.840 --> 1:27:37.120]  time callers won't give you a chance to call in today. What do you think about the election?
[1:27:37.120 --> 1:27:43.240]  What do you think about Sanders, Trump, Hillary? The Republicans. Jeb's pretty arrogant a few
[1:27:43.240 --> 1:27:47.400]  months ago. Remember, he told CNN he goes, we'll see what happens once the convention gets there.
[1:27:47.400 --> 1:27:51.240]  I feel like I'm going to get the nomination. That's why I'm staying into the end. Doesn't
[1:27:51.240 --> 1:27:57.720]  matter how many votes Trump gets. You can go pull the quotes up. Because the Republicans have put
[1:27:57.720 --> 1:28:02.480]  in similar hanky-panky stuff. Not as bad as the Democrats, but it's pretty bad with their
[1:28:02.480 --> 1:28:08.700]  delegate process. And that's why George Washington wanted parties outlawed. He was all for free
[1:28:08.700 --> 1:28:14.200]  speech, but he said these parties should be outlawed being involved in the process and
[1:28:14.200 --> 1:28:19.720]  controlling it, or they will turn us into factionalism and it's over. And folks, that's
[1:28:19.720 --> 1:28:25.000]  why you can't have campaign finance reform. Because the campaign finance reform they bring
[1:28:25.000 --> 1:28:33.320]  forward every time is to shut down small donors or billionaires or dark horses. The elite
[1:28:33.320 --> 1:28:36.720]  already know how to game the system. They already have the media manipulation. They
[1:28:36.720 --> 1:28:42.560]  already have all that in place. And so now they want to come in because they've sewed
[1:28:42.560 --> 1:28:47.360]  things up and shut off the quote, special interest. It's illegal for foreign governments
[1:28:47.360 --> 1:28:51.480]  to give money to political candidates. The Communist Chinese and everybody else openly
[1:28:51.480 --> 1:28:55.760]  give Hillary money. Nothing's done about it. The Dineshya Susi gets five friends to give
[1:28:55.760 --> 1:29:01.200]  to a failed Senate campaign for his college roommate and they arrest him, indict him,
[1:29:01.200 --> 1:29:08.560]  and lock him up for nine months. But Hillary can get billions of dollars from dictators
[1:29:08.560 --> 1:29:12.400]  and people and it's okay. It's all going to be selectively enforced. Let me explain
[1:29:12.400 --> 1:29:16.960]  that to everybody. I've seen them do this in other countries. They're following a script.
[1:29:16.960 --> 1:29:24.920]  The exact script in Europe to send social workers to everyone's homes to be co-parents.
[1:29:24.920 --> 1:29:32.520]  The exact script word for word is being implemented in the U.S. today. I'm going to cover that
[1:29:32.520 --> 1:29:36.400]  and then go right to your phone calls. On the other side, I'm Alex Jones. By the way,
[1:29:36.400 --> 1:29:41.000]  the new Hillary for President shirt limited edition is in the new design. The witch hates
[1:29:41.000 --> 1:29:45.120]  free speech. We're going to exercise it and she can crawl back under that rock. We're
[1:29:45.120 --> 1:29:56.600]  on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. Beyonce
[1:29:56.600 --> 1:30:01.040]  now claims she knew nothing about Black Lives Matter hijacking her Super Bowl performance.
[1:30:01.040 --> 1:30:04.600]  That's the headline from the Daily Mail. So now, let's look at some of the facts. Beyonce
[1:30:04.600 --> 1:30:08.080]  and her dancers just happened to be dressed as Black Panthers, showing the clenched Black
[1:30:08.080 --> 1:30:11.720]  Power Fist during her Super Bowl halftime performance. She just happened to be adorned
[1:30:11.720 --> 1:30:15.680]  in golden jewelry made to look like bullet bandoliers. She also just happened to be performing
[1:30:15.680 --> 1:30:19.800]  her song Formation, whose music video depicts Beyonce dancing atop a flooded New Orleans
[1:30:19.800 --> 1:30:23.840]  police car and depicts a young Black child dancing in front of a phalanx of riot cops
[1:30:23.840 --> 1:30:27.760]  near a wall that has stopped shooting us spray painted on it. The day before her performance,
[1:30:27.760 --> 1:30:32.120]  her husband, Rap mogul Jay-Z, just happened to give $1.5 million to the Black Lives Matter
[1:30:32.120 --> 1:30:36.800]  movement. The same Jay-Z has also been photographed wearing a 5% nation medallion, whose members
[1:30:36.800 --> 1:30:41.320]  claim God is Black and white people are weak, wicked and inferior, basically an errant child
[1:30:41.320 --> 1:30:45.200]  that needs to be corrected. Jay-Z just also happened to bail out rioters and protesters
[1:30:45.200 --> 1:30:49.400]  in Baltimore following Freddie Gray's death. So of course, Beyonce was absolutely clueless
[1:30:49.400 --> 1:30:52.880]  of the racial division she helped propagate during the biggest bread and circus event
[1:30:52.880 --> 1:30:55.440]  of the year. Rob Dew reporting for infowars.com.

[1:31:08.240 --> 1:31:13.200]  I have drive to go to the gym. I feel like I look better. I feel better. I feel sexier.

[1:31:58.040 --> 1:32:02.680]  Thousands of years ago there was a basic form of chivalry. Our ancestors would hear the
[1:32:02.680 --> 1:32:08.960]  drums of war as the enemy approached, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize
[1:32:08.960 --> 1:32:15.160]  and prepare a defense. Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled
[1:32:15.160 --> 1:32:21.360]  with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens. But in the 21st century, there
[1:32:21.360 --> 1:32:26.800]  were silent weapons for quiet war. Pathenogens added to the food and water and to the lining
[1:32:26.800 --> 1:32:32.280]  of plastics that destroy our vitality, turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey
[1:32:32.280 --> 1:32:35.680]  towards death. I personally counter this onslaught with
[1:32:35.680 --> 1:32:41.160]  Enthroplex, the latest product from infowarslife.com. It's time for us to take our bodies back
[1:32:41.160 --> 1:32:46.480]  into our own hands and it starts at infowarslife.com with Enthroplex. And finally, for a limited

[1:32:55.480 --> 1:33:05.000]  As a community moves towards despotism, respect is restricted to fewer people. That's veteran
[1:33:05.000 --> 1:33:14.000]  Denver police officer Charles Jones IV, smashing an unarmed suspect in the face. Six times.
[1:33:14.000 --> 1:33:17.920]  Officers accused of using excessive force on a suspect in the tribe to erase the evidence
[1:33:17.920 --> 1:33:18.920]  of...
[1:33:18.920 --> 1:33:19.920]  I'm not observing what they're doing in the room.
[1:33:19.920 --> 1:33:21.920]  Save me, I don't understand what's going on.
[1:33:21.920 --> 1:33:28.920]  A community rates low on an information scale. When the press, radio and other channels
[1:33:28.920 --> 1:33:31.920]  of communication are controlled by only a few people.
[1:33:31.920 --> 1:33:36.440]  Does it raise ethical questions about the use of government money to produce stories
[1:33:36.440 --> 1:33:39.920]  about the government that wind up being aired with no disclosure that they were produced
[1:33:39.920 --> 1:33:40.920]  by the government?
[1:33:40.920 --> 1:33:42.920]  How time you ask such a question.
[1:33:42.920 --> 1:33:44.920]  What difference at this point does it make?
[1:33:44.920 --> 1:33:50.920]  When a competent observer looks for signs of despotism in the community, he looks beyond
[1:33:50.920 --> 1:33:52.920]  to find words and noble phrases.
[1:33:52.920 --> 1:33:57.520]  There are actions I have the legal authority to take as president that will help make our
[1:33:57.520 --> 1:34:02.920]  immigration system more fair and more just. Tonight, I'm announcing those actions.
[1:34:02.920 --> 1:34:09.920]  What I say goes, see, I'm the law around here.
[1:34:09.920 --> 1:34:14.920]  You came, I'm saw, you died.
[1:34:14.920 --> 1:34:19.920]  Yes, at modern warfare, our military leaders are finding that words and ideas are highly
[1:34:19.920 --> 1:34:21.920]  effective weapons.
[1:34:21.920 --> 1:34:23.920]  You just have to be repetitive about this.
[1:34:23.920 --> 1:34:27.920]  We need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking
[1:34:27.920 --> 1:34:30.920]  about guns in a vastly different way.
[1:34:30.920 --> 1:34:34.920]  We are trained to deceive if we have to. You really don't have to trust me.
[1:34:34.920 --> 1:34:35.920]  You shouldn't trust me.
[1:34:35.920 --> 1:34:39.920]  In fact, by my actually participating that, I will taint the news.
[1:34:39.920 --> 1:34:43.920]  In communities of this kind, despotism stands a good chance.
[1:34:43.920 --> 1:34:49.920]  The nine most terrifying words in the English language are, I'm from the government and
[1:34:49.920 --> 1:34:50.920]  I'm here to help.
[1:34:50.920 --> 1:34:51.920]  Help getting this youth.
[1:34:51.920 --> 1:34:55.920]  Well, we're going to do everything we can to help you.
[1:34:55.920 --> 1:34:59.920]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[1:34:59.920 --> 1:35:06.920]  It's the Alex Jones show because there is a war for your mind.
[1:35:06.920 --> 1:35:14.920]  First, they dumb you down and then they scramble your brain with a bunch of disinformation.
[1:35:14.920 --> 1:35:17.920]  And then they just come right out and say, it doesn't matter how you vote.
[1:35:17.920 --> 1:35:20.920]  We got super delegates, Republican and Democrat.
[1:35:20.920 --> 1:35:22.920]  And it's not stealing your vote.
[1:35:22.920 --> 1:35:27.920]  We just disregard it and they throw it your face.
[1:35:27.920 --> 1:35:33.920]  And we're now on the throw it your face part of the takeover.
[1:35:33.920 --> 1:35:36.920]  I want to hit this article because I keep mentioning it.
[1:35:36.920 --> 1:35:38.920]  And then I'm going to go to your phone calls.
[1:35:38.920 --> 1:35:46.920]  The article is up on info wars.com and prison planet.com.
[1:35:46.920 --> 1:35:53.920]  And it makes me particularly nauseous and Paul Watson did a great job writing the article.
[1:35:53.920 --> 1:35:58.920]  But he didn't even give it a hardcore enough headline.
[1:35:58.920 --> 1:36:02.920]  You know, some people think I have sensational headlines or make sensational statements.
[1:36:02.920 --> 1:36:08.920]  People have gotten sensationally conditioned to accept all this.
[1:36:08.920 --> 1:36:12.920]  This is up on info wars.com.
[1:36:12.920 --> 1:36:16.920]  Feds push a new plan for home visits to check on parents.
[1:36:16.920 --> 1:36:25.920]  Well, really federal government announces that government agents will be assigned to quote co parent children.
[1:36:25.920 --> 1:36:33.920]  Or feds announced that a fed will be assigned to be your child's parent.
[1:36:33.920 --> 1:36:36.920]  I mean, that's what it actually says.
[1:36:36.920 --> 1:36:45.920]  And that's why they started having Melissa Harris Perry and all their operatives go on TV and start announcing in promo ads, your kids belong to the system.
[1:36:45.920 --> 1:36:52.920]  They had a California courts federally rule of six, seven years ago that actually the state is the parent.
[1:36:52.920 --> 1:36:54.920]  You're just a custodian.
[1:36:54.920 --> 1:37:01.920]  Now, another federal court overruled that, but that's what they're doing.
[1:37:01.920 --> 1:37:05.920]  Feds push new plan for home visits to check on parents.
[1:37:05.920 --> 1:37:08.920]  Government appointed monitor to assess upbringing of children.
[1:37:08.920 --> 1:37:14.920]  And believe me, they're going to find something, but more importantly, they're going to find and feed you.
[1:37:14.920 --> 1:37:18.920]  And they're going to talk to your child when they're three years old about how they sexually identify.
[1:37:18.920 --> 1:37:20.920]  Oh, that's a big part of it.
[1:37:20.920 --> 1:37:23.920]  Screwing your kid's head.
[1:37:23.920 --> 1:37:34.920]  And that's what all the new college educations are going to be for all these dandies that don't know how to find their butt with both hands or tie their shoelaces or run a company or work.
[1:37:34.920 --> 1:37:36.920]  But boy, they know how to run your life.
[1:37:36.920 --> 1:37:49.920]  That's what they learn in college is how to watch other people and report them and demand speak, be restricted and have their feelings hurt because they walked by a Halloween party and saw a geisha girl.
[1:37:49.920 --> 1:37:53.920]  They're commissars. They're political police.
[1:37:53.920 --> 1:37:55.920]  I mean, that's out of red dawn.
[1:37:55.920 --> 1:38:01.920]  They have a mock reeducation camp at the sports stadium.
[1:38:01.920 --> 1:38:03.920]  You know, your founding fathers are bad.
[1:38:03.920 --> 1:38:05.920]  It's bad to say there's fathers.
[1:38:05.920 --> 1:38:06.920]  That's that's anti-woman.
[1:38:06.920 --> 1:38:13.920]  I mean, that's in the background of the loudspeakers in the movie because that's what the Soviets would actually do in a country they've gotten control of.
[1:38:13.920 --> 1:38:16.920]  And you know what they do in a reeducation camp?
[1:38:16.920 --> 1:38:26.920]  It's in high schools and sports stadiums because if you're good and behave yourself for a few weeks and they trust that, then you get to go live in the dormitory and even leave and go do errands.
[1:38:26.920 --> 1:38:38.920]  And you actually are their slave, but you're in a communist utopia, but out of the sports stadium where they've got cages where the people won't go along with their orders or won't tell them where the guns are.
[1:38:38.920 --> 1:38:47.920]  Or won't tell them where the veterans are.
[1:38:47.920 --> 1:38:49.920]  They're in there beating people.
[1:38:49.920 --> 1:38:54.920]  Blutting their noses, torturing them, not feeding them, breaking them.
[1:38:54.920 --> 1:38:56.920]  And then they let you out into society.
[1:38:56.920 --> 1:39:03.920]  Once you've submitted it and they teach you, you go to your weekly meetings, they tell you what words to use and how to behave.
[1:39:03.920 --> 1:39:04.920]  And you do it.
[1:39:04.920 --> 1:39:10.920]  And most people go into a reverse Stockholm syndrome and they actually will decide to join with it.
[1:39:10.920 --> 1:39:11.920]  It was right.
[1:39:11.920 --> 1:39:14.920]  America was bad.
[1:39:14.920 --> 1:39:16.920]  You can't have a preacher out preaching.
[1:39:16.920 --> 1:39:17.920]  I find it offensive.
[1:39:17.920 --> 1:39:18.920]  Arrest him.
[1:39:18.920 --> 1:39:20.920]  Yes, yes, Martin Luther King.
[1:39:20.920 --> 1:39:26.920]  I mean, you know, the social engineers are going excellent job at Oregon State and many other colleges.
[1:39:26.920 --> 1:39:36.920]  They are pulling down the Martin Luther King signs or demanded because he said all God's children together one day in the future up on that mountain living together.
[1:39:36.920 --> 1:39:39.920]  Not because the color of their skin, but because what they stand for.
[1:39:39.920 --> 1:39:40.920]  I'm paraphrasing it.
[1:39:40.920 --> 1:39:42.920]  And then that's on the wall.
[1:39:42.920 --> 1:39:45.920]  It doesn't say transgender.
[1:39:45.920 --> 1:39:47.920]  It says God.
[1:39:47.920 --> 1:39:48.920]  That's offensive.
[1:39:48.920 --> 1:39:54.920]  Take it down.
[1:39:54.920 --> 1:39:56.920]  You're like, oh, they'll never get to that point.
[1:39:56.920 --> 1:39:58.920]  Yes, they will.
[1:39:58.920 --> 1:40:00.920]  They run the show now.
[1:40:00.920 --> 1:40:02.920]  Unless you say no and stand against them.
[1:40:02.920 --> 1:40:05.920]  And by the way, they're not well-meaning weirdos.
[1:40:05.920 --> 1:40:07.920]  This is systematic worldwide.
[1:40:07.920 --> 1:40:09.920]  This is a program.
[1:40:09.920 --> 1:40:16.920]  And that's why the more ridiculous the Dean would like to speak to you because you're a fit of a Martin Luther King.
[1:40:16.920 --> 1:40:21.920]  And then the student group says, yes, then we should have a vote.
[1:40:21.920 --> 1:40:27.920]  I'm sorry that you've been hurt by this will have it removed if you vote to do that.
[1:40:27.920 --> 1:40:29.920]  Good job.
[1:40:29.920 --> 1:40:34.920]  You're really helping the community now.
[1:40:34.920 --> 1:40:36.920]  And they know full well what they're doing.
[1:40:36.920 --> 1:40:38.920]  They are sabotaging young people.
[1:40:38.920 --> 1:40:41.920]  They are frying their brains.
[1:40:41.920 --> 1:40:48.920]  They're just busy trying to get money in their Swiss bank account and get out of this country.
[1:40:48.920 --> 1:40:51.920]  There's a disdain for the public with a lot of the mercenaries.
[1:40:51.920 --> 1:40:53.920]  A lot of these folks aren't even communists.
[1:40:53.920 --> 1:40:55.920]  They're just mercenaries.
[1:40:55.920 --> 1:40:57.920]  And they go, look, the public's so dumb.
[1:40:57.920 --> 1:41:01.920]  You better just get as much money as you can and get out of the nation.
[1:41:01.920 --> 1:41:04.920]  So, see, they know it's pure evil.
[1:41:04.920 --> 1:41:06.920]  And they go and they dutifully learn how to do it.
[1:41:06.920 --> 1:41:08.920]  They learn how to brainwash.
[1:41:08.920 --> 1:41:12.920]  They take courses in how to dumb people down, the Delphi technique, all of it.
[1:41:12.920 --> 1:41:19.920]  And then they come in systematically and are eyeing you and your family when you take your tuition money down or break your back to send your kids to college.
[1:41:19.920 --> 1:41:21.920]  And they get inducted.
[1:41:21.920 --> 1:41:35.920]  They're being inducted to a giant brainwashing camp to then spill out like viruses, swarms of officers to eat out our substance and imperiously run around and boss everyone around.
[1:41:35.920 --> 1:41:37.920]  Let's read the article that I'm going to your calls.
[1:41:37.920 --> 1:41:44.920]  The feds push new plan for home visits to check on parents.
[1:41:44.920 --> 1:41:46.920]  Not even when there's a vague phone call.
[1:41:46.920 --> 1:41:51.920]  No, everybody gets the visit starting at age two or three.
[1:41:51.920 --> 1:41:55.920]  And then, oh, then we form that relationship for the co-parenting.
[1:41:55.920 --> 1:41:59.920]  Oh, yeah, you think you can divorce your husband or your wife or whatever?
[1:41:59.920 --> 1:42:00.920]  And that's a hassle.
[1:42:00.920 --> 1:42:02.920]  Now the state is in your life.
[1:42:02.920 --> 1:42:06.920]  The state is in the middle at your dinner table.
[1:42:06.920 --> 1:42:13.920]  And in the first phase, if you step in fashion or nice, there'll be TV shows about how the social workers help and it's good overall.
[1:42:13.920 --> 1:42:15.920]  And they do the right thing.
[1:42:15.920 --> 1:42:16.920]  And oh, they fix society.
[1:42:16.920 --> 1:42:19.920]  And this, this kid was on crack and they did a good job.
[1:42:19.920 --> 1:42:21.920]  And this, this dad was beating them.
[1:42:21.920 --> 1:42:23.920]  Of course, they're going to quote, do some good.
[1:42:23.920 --> 1:42:25.920]  The point is, it's totally unconstitutional.
[1:42:25.920 --> 1:42:30.920]  It's directly out of Nazi Germany, directly out of Soviet Russia, directly out of Maoist China.
[1:42:30.920 --> 1:42:35.920]  I mean, it is the big tyrant gorilla.
[1:42:35.920 --> 1:42:40.920]  I mean, it's the bona fide Matt Daddy cherry on top baby.
[1:42:40.920 --> 1:42:46.920]  It don't get worse.
[1:42:46.920 --> 1:42:50.920]  And you're not going to have jobs with industry in America.
[1:42:50.920 --> 1:42:51.920]  You're, this is your future.
[1:42:51.920 --> 1:42:58.920]  You're going to have to see a lot of folks are going to have, there's going to be TV shows about what heroes they are.
[1:42:58.920 --> 1:43:05.920]  The federal government is seeking to create a new bureaucracy that would intervene in family life.
[1:43:05.920 --> 1:43:11.920]  And could even see state appointed monitors conduct routine home visits to assess the child's wellbeing.
[1:43:11.920 --> 1:43:14.920]  Oh, we gave you fluoride and all the sugar and TV.
[1:43:14.920 --> 1:43:16.920]  And now you're not performing well.
[1:43:16.920 --> 1:43:19.920]  We're building giant special education wards everywhere.
[1:43:19.920 --> 1:43:20.920]  Oh, society's collapsing.
[1:43:20.920 --> 1:43:21.920]  We're here to help.
[1:43:21.920 --> 1:43:26.920]  And of course, the folks shelling up to quote, help will mean well themselves.
[1:43:26.920 --> 1:43:32.920]  The US Department of Education, US Department of Health and Human Services has published a draft document,
[1:43:32.920 --> 1:43:38.920]  which is already being done in Europe, which outlines a plan that will treat families as quote equal partners.
[1:43:38.920 --> 1:43:41.920]  Oh, see, you're equal now with the government.
[1:43:41.920 --> 1:43:47.920]  It's a friendly thing like the Patriot Act in the raising of children,
[1:43:47.920 --> 1:43:50.920]  opening the door for government intrusion in all levels.
[1:43:50.920 --> 1:43:54.920]  The paper describes how government employees will intervene to provide monitoring.
[1:43:54.920 --> 1:43:57.920]  See, they will provide monitoring goals.
[1:43:57.920 --> 1:44:01.920]  That means your orders for the children at home and the classroom.
[1:44:01.920 --> 1:44:06.920]  Oh, a federal ward in your local independent school.
[1:44:06.920 --> 1:44:11.920]  And that if parents are failing to meet the standards you're all being put on probation,
[1:44:11.920 --> 1:44:15.920]  evidence based parenting interventions will be made to quote,
[1:44:15.920 --> 1:44:21.920]  ensure that children, social, emotional and behavioral needs are met.
[1:44:21.920 --> 1:44:26.920]  The document reveals how the state will help oversee, this is all quotes,
[1:44:26.920 --> 1:44:33.920]  constant monitoring and communication regarding children's social, emotional and behavioral health through the government computers.
[1:44:33.920 --> 1:44:40.920]  The document reveals how the state will help oversee constant monitoring and communications
[1:44:40.920 --> 1:44:43.920]  regarding children's social, emotional and behavioral health.
[1:44:43.920 --> 1:44:45.920]  I remember when we learned 15 years ago that the new federal computers,
[1:44:45.920 --> 1:44:51.920]  your kids are writing articles or papers for English class, whatever, it's all going on a federal database.
[1:44:51.920 --> 1:44:54.920]  NSA, FBI, local police, but also the bureaucrats.
[1:44:54.920 --> 1:44:58.920]  I mean, this is so sick, your children's diaries, they're basically reading them.
[1:44:58.920 --> 1:45:03.920]  They're artwork, all going into a government file on your kid.
[1:45:03.920 --> 1:45:07.920]  I mean, it's 50 times worse than Eastern Europe.
[1:45:07.920 --> 1:45:10.920]  It's so incredible.
[1:45:10.920 --> 1:45:16.920]  The program bears the hallmarks of a controversial scheme in Scotland set to take effect later this year,
[1:45:16.920 --> 1:45:25.920]  which under a shadow parent, close quote, appointment by the government would monitor the upbringing of every child until the age of 18.
[1:45:25.920 --> 1:45:32.920]  The document argues that Big Brother needs to know about essentially everything for the purpose and benefit of the child.
[1:45:32.920 --> 1:45:41.920]  It needs to partner with close quote in caring for close quote, citing research, the policy statement claims that the quote institutions where children
[1:45:41.920 --> 1:45:44.920]  learn cannot ignore family wellness if they want to.
[1:45:44.920 --> 1:45:48.920]  We just can't ignore your family because it's sick because we made it sick.
[1:45:48.920 --> 1:45:50.920]  And now we're going to end it.
[1:45:50.920 --> 1:45:52.920]  Now we have the death below.
[1:45:52.920 --> 1:45:57.920]  We've already stabbed and angered and diseased the bull that stumbles around the arena.
[1:45:57.920 --> 1:45:59.920]  And now the Matador is there.
[1:45:59.920 --> 1:46:04.120]  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun. Ha ha ha ha ha.
[1:46:04.120 --> 1:46:06.920]  Burney Sanders is here. Everything's free.
[1:46:06.920 --> 1:46:10.920]  Look, 1967's wearing actual mouth outfits every day.
[1:46:10.920 --> 1:46:11.920]  Oh, everything's wonderful.
[1:46:11.920 --> 1:46:13.920]  Oh my gosh. Armored vehicles.
[1:46:13.920 --> 1:46:15.320]  Oh, they love you.
[1:46:15.320 --> 1:46:18.920]  I mean, I mean, woah, woah.
[1:46:18.920 --> 1:46:19.920]  This is really who we are.
[1:46:19.920 --> 1:46:22.920]  This is really what we're going to put up with.
[1:46:22.920 --> 1:46:24.920]  Just, I said I'd go to your calls.
[1:46:24.920 --> 1:46:26.920]  I just can't, I can't do this anymore.
[1:46:26.920 --> 1:46:28.920]  That's one article.
[1:46:28.920 --> 1:46:32.320]  I've got like 200 more that are just as bad. I mean just look at this
[1:46:32.960 --> 1:46:39.280]  It doesn't matter how you vote. We have the delegates. Ha ha ha ha ha you know NATO warships ordered to a G in to help migrant crisis
[1:46:39.280 --> 1:46:41.280]  I mean ship them in
[1:46:41.800 --> 1:46:44.480]  Russian prime minister warrants US Saudis against starting
[1:46:45.040 --> 1:46:49.080]  Permanent war with ground intervention in Syria that could quote lead to new World War
[1:46:51.800 --> 1:46:55.200]  New York production company launches killing Republicans the musical
[1:46:55.200 --> 1:47:03.480]  A Danish man, convicted, fined for Facebook posts comparing Islam with Nazism, University
[1:47:03.480 --> 1:47:10.240]  of Texas police give preacher citation for offending students, energy department investigated
[1:47:10.240 --> 1:47:15.480]  by Congress for firing whistleblowers, Clive and Bundy to stay in jail until next week.
[1:47:15.480 --> 1:47:21.840]  They wanted to be imprisoned for 40 plus years.
[1:47:21.840 --> 1:47:25.160]  When it goes on and on, oh, don't worry though, a new freedom women, they're getting ready
[1:47:25.160 --> 1:47:33.320]  to draft you, oh, but don't worry, in exchange for your free education, they only want five
[1:47:33.320 --> 1:47:40.600]  years in the draft proposals of compulsory government service.
[1:47:40.600 --> 1:47:46.040]  They have a name for that, it's called slavery, but it's part of your free education.
[1:47:46.040 --> 1:47:49.520]  So you can be somebody.
[1:47:49.520 --> 1:47:53.560]  You can learn about empowering women because you like Hillary and her mall outfits.
[1:47:53.560 --> 1:47:58.320]  Oh, and then global stocks continue to crash is oil plummets and gold skyrockets.
[1:47:58.320 --> 1:48:01.680]  We're going to get to that.
[1:48:01.680 --> 1:48:04.840]  And I haven't gotten into the science, the world news, the rest of the info wars news.
[1:48:04.840 --> 1:48:07.800]  Oh, there's a lot of it today here and we have blue rock well coming up.
[1:48:07.800 --> 1:48:11.200]  But right now, we're going to go bankrupt here.
[1:48:11.200 --> 1:48:12.200]  Plus it's incredible.
[1:48:12.200 --> 1:48:13.200]  They want me to extend the sales.
[1:48:13.200 --> 1:48:17.440]  It's very popular on our new flagship product.
[1:48:17.440 --> 1:48:22.840]  That is so amazing and throw plex that has a lot of the same great key ingredients there
[1:48:22.840 --> 1:48:26.640]  in super mail, super female mentality, but some added ingredients as well to form an

[1:48:40.200 --> 1:48:44.840]  it for one more day, but I don't want to be a victim of my own success and then sell out

[1:54:22.360 --> 1:54:38.520]  All right, we're going to your phone calls here, but we're all back there in the coffee
[1:54:38.520 --> 1:54:45.200]  room because even though I told them don't get me a birthday cake, they did it.
[1:54:45.200 --> 1:54:50.520]  And I got back in town yesterday, so yesterday was my birthday, but today they got me a cake
[1:54:50.520 --> 1:54:59.600]  and we're just back there going, yeah, like, what have we done to be cursed with all this?
[1:54:59.600 --> 1:55:04.520]  I mean, all the crazy stuff they're doing gets to me, but Hillary wearing actual Communist
[1:55:04.520 --> 1:55:13.840]  Party outfits, I mean, exact copies in every debate now.
[1:55:13.840 --> 1:55:18.200]  By the way, retro ones from when Mao killed 80-something million people, I mean, it'd
[1:55:18.200 --> 1:55:26.760]  be like if Hillary was wearing a Hitler uniform with the armband.
[1:55:26.760 --> 1:55:31.080]  And that's what she's telling her supporters is I'm getting ready to run a Mao operation
[1:55:31.080 --> 1:55:38.120]  in America.
[1:55:38.120 --> 1:55:40.720]  And some people would say, oh, that's not what she means.
[1:55:40.720 --> 1:55:45.680]  I mean, they're openly going to steal the election from Bernie Sanders and her people
[1:55:45.680 --> 1:55:47.560]  go, does it matter how you vote?
[1:55:47.560 --> 1:55:49.040]  You're going to put it in.
[1:55:49.040 --> 1:55:51.320]  I mean, that's totalitarian.
[1:55:51.320 --> 1:55:53.440]  That's these people are bad news.
[1:55:53.440 --> 1:56:02.760]  And they've been in power so long, they think it's completely normal.
[1:56:02.760 --> 1:56:05.160]  And it gets weirder and weirder and weirder and weirder.
[1:56:05.160 --> 1:56:07.360]  Yeah, that's more of a 1984 outfit.
[1:56:07.360 --> 1:56:08.920]  That's where she's actually dressed like Mao.
[1:56:08.920 --> 1:56:12.200]  When I say Maoist, I mean, Maoist era women's clothing.
[1:56:12.200 --> 1:56:13.320]  Show her the last three debates.
[1:56:13.320 --> 1:56:14.320]  We've got to do that.
[1:56:14.320 --> 1:56:19.080]  I didn't even know that Biggs had noticed this months ago and I'll notice it when I'm
[1:56:19.080 --> 1:56:21.480]  with my kids or watching TV and I'm like, look at that.
[1:56:21.480 --> 1:56:25.320]  There she is wearing a communist Chinese outfit again.
[1:56:25.320 --> 1:56:28.600]  That's what the party women wear.
[1:56:28.600 --> 1:56:34.880]  And the first five or six times, but now it's that is her uniform is a Mao era communist
[1:56:34.880 --> 1:56:35.880]  outfit.
[1:56:35.880 --> 1:56:41.720]  She'll probably show up in overalls that O'Brien wore when he ran the torture center
[1:56:41.720 --> 1:56:46.120]  in 1984 next.
[1:56:46.120 --> 1:56:51.720]  It's the equivalent of her growing a Hitler mustache, folks.
[1:56:51.720 --> 1:56:59.720]  And I don't know what to do anymore.
[1:56:59.720 --> 1:57:00.720]  I'm sorry.
[1:57:00.720 --> 1:57:01.720]  I said I go your calls.
[1:57:01.720 --> 1:57:04.360]  I'm actually freaking out right now.
[1:57:04.360 --> 1:57:08.680]  I mean, how much more obvious does it have to get with these scumbags?
[1:57:08.680 --> 1:57:12.640]  Let's go to Carol and Chris, Clemford, Kyle Carson.
[1:57:12.640 --> 1:57:13.640]  Thank you for holding.
[1:57:13.640 --> 1:57:14.640]  Sorry.
[1:57:14.640 --> 1:57:15.640]  I've made you wait.
[1:57:15.640 --> 1:57:16.640]  I'm just out of control today.
[1:57:16.640 --> 1:57:17.640]  Carl and Pennsylvania.
[1:57:17.640 --> 1:57:18.640]  I mean, what do you think of all this?
[1:57:18.640 --> 1:57:23.560]  Am I freaking out or should I go put on a Mao outfit myself and just join this and then
[1:57:23.560 --> 1:57:27.680]  go live in a reeducation camp and just everything will be free in my slave pit?
[1:57:27.680 --> 1:57:29.240]  I mean, should I just do that?
[1:57:29.240 --> 1:57:31.440]  Hey, Alex, I, it's Carol.
[1:57:31.440 --> 1:57:32.440]  How you doing?
[1:57:32.440 --> 1:57:33.440]  I'm good, Carol.
[1:57:33.440 --> 1:57:34.440]  Go ahead.
[1:57:34.440 --> 1:57:37.080]  Well, actually, Alex, that would not be a very good look for you.
[1:57:37.080 --> 1:57:40.080]  I mean, it's like, she's got a, she's got a, uh, a shrubby body.
[1:57:40.080 --> 1:57:41.080]  It's not a good look for you.
[1:57:41.080 --> 1:57:42.080]  So, you know.
[1:57:42.080 --> 1:57:47.240]  Well, I mean, obviously I'm not going to wear a, a, a, a Maoist female outfit, but
[1:57:47.240 --> 1:57:50.080]  should I start wearing a Maoist, a tongue outfit?
[1:57:50.080 --> 1:57:55.400]  Well, then you just be following the trend, the trendy people, the brain dead zombies
[1:57:55.400 --> 1:57:56.400]  then, you know.
[1:57:56.400 --> 1:57:57.400]  Yeah.
[1:57:57.400 --> 1:57:58.400]  Because everybody knows Mao was so wonderful.
[1:57:58.400 --> 1:58:01.600]  I mean, David Rockefeller wrote an op-ed for New York Times saying I already was.
[1:58:01.600 --> 1:58:03.840]  So I mean, I guess I was going to get with the program, don't I?
[1:58:03.840 --> 1:58:05.480]  You know, ultra-retz supporting Mao.
[1:58:05.480 --> 1:58:06.480]  Why?
[1:58:06.480 --> 1:58:08.480]  Because he brought him into slavery.
[1:58:08.480 --> 1:58:09.480]  Carol, I'm sorry.
[1:58:09.480 --> 1:58:10.480]  Go ahead and make your point.
[1:58:10.480 --> 1:58:11.480]  Go ahead.
[1:58:11.480 --> 1:58:12.480]  Okay.
[1:58:12.480 --> 1:58:15.480]  Well, actually, actually my point was going back to, um, you were talking to Matt earlier.
[1:58:15.480 --> 1:58:18.480]  I just want to take you back a little bit of what, about what he was saying.
[1:58:18.480 --> 1:58:19.480]  Right.
[1:58:19.480 --> 1:58:23.480]  Being a, being a patriot, it's, it's, it's a very lonely, it's a very lonely life.
[1:58:23.480 --> 1:58:24.480]  It is.
[1:58:24.480 --> 1:58:25.480]  Like, especially if you're a woman.
[1:58:25.480 --> 1:58:26.480]  Yeah.
[1:58:26.480 --> 1:58:29.640]  Because you like private property and freedom and the right to self-defense and don't want
[1:58:29.640 --> 1:58:32.760]  weird leaders stealing elections while wearing communist uniforms.
[1:58:32.760 --> 1:58:33.760]  Hold on.
[1:58:33.760 --> 1:58:34.760]  I'm going to come back to you in 70 seconds, Carol.
[1:58:34.760 --> 1:58:36.560]  I want you to be able to make your point.
[1:58:36.560 --> 1:58:37.560]  Thanks.
[1:58:37.560 --> 1:58:38.560]  Yeah.
[1:58:38.560 --> 1:58:39.560]  Because the media makes you feel lonely.
[1:58:39.560 --> 1:58:40.560]  We're really the majority.
[1:58:40.560 --> 1:58:41.560]  Visit GCNLive.com.
[1:58:41.560 --> 1:58:44.160]  Once you're talking about the people at the colleges who literally can't tie their shoelaces,

[1:58:57.720 --> 1:58:59.480]  at the computer all day working doing good.
[1:58:59.480 --> 1:59:00.880]  You're still damaging your brain.
[1:59:00.880 --> 1:59:03.000]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[1:59:03.000 --> 1:59:06.280]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it, it has natural things that
[1:59:06.280 --> 1:59:07.280]  do it clean.

[2:00:04.000 --> 2:00:33.520]  We're going to keep you real safe on a government reservation dumbed down.
[2:00:33.520 --> 2:00:35.840]  That's how we're going to control you.
[2:00:35.840 --> 2:00:39.880]  If that's what they've done is turned the Western world into a giant prison with a bunch
[2:00:39.880 --> 2:00:43.600]  of brainwashed people, Carol, Kyle, Carson, Chris, Clifford, I'm going to get to all of
[2:00:43.600 --> 2:00:44.600]  you now.
[2:00:44.600 --> 2:00:48.000]  Carol, go ahead and make your point about responding to Matt earlier that was talking
[2:00:48.000 --> 2:00:49.000]  about Bernie Sanders.
[2:00:49.000 --> 2:00:50.000]  Go ahead.
[2:00:50.000 --> 2:00:51.000]  Okay.
[2:00:51.000 --> 2:00:55.000]  It's like trying to educate somebody who is semi-informed.
[2:00:55.000 --> 2:00:58.520]  It's like the first date, last date, it was like sudden death.
[2:00:58.520 --> 2:01:04.760]  If you have a tiny bit of sort of evidence on what's going on in this world, then you're
[2:01:04.760 --> 2:01:06.440]  suddenly you're a pariah.
[2:01:06.440 --> 2:01:08.800]  You don't know what you're talking about.
[2:01:08.800 --> 2:01:09.800]  You're an infidel.
[2:01:09.800 --> 2:01:13.240]  That's because there's so many stupid people who don't know anything.
[2:01:13.240 --> 2:01:17.960]  They just know how to act like you're weird like, you know how to read a book?
[2:01:17.960 --> 2:01:20.480]  He uses big words.
[2:01:20.480 --> 2:01:24.400]  That's their emotional defense mechanism, Carol.
[2:01:24.400 --> 2:01:25.400]  God bless you.
[2:01:25.400 --> 2:01:26.400]  I appreciate you calling.
[2:01:26.400 --> 2:01:30.960]  I don't know what circle you're in, but I'd get out of it.
[2:01:30.960 --> 2:01:35.440]  When you're informed, you know how the world works, if you get into a circle that's smart
[2:01:35.440 --> 2:01:39.560]  like you are or more informed, then they'll appreciate that.
[2:01:39.560 --> 2:01:44.440]  But they have dumbed down so much of the public to a certain point now that they get
[2:01:44.440 --> 2:01:45.560]  upset.
[2:01:45.560 --> 2:01:50.680]  And I'm telling you, someday if you know how to tie your shoelaces or if all your chromosomes
[2:01:50.680 --> 2:01:56.960]  line up right, then I'm serious, they're going to try to hunt us down because misery
[2:01:56.960 --> 2:01:57.960]  loves company.
[2:01:57.960 --> 2:02:01.280]  Let's go ahead and talk to Kyle in Pennsylvania.
[2:02:01.280 --> 2:02:02.840]  Thanks for holding her on the ear.
[2:02:02.840 --> 2:02:04.400]  Hey, what's up, Alex?
[2:02:04.400 --> 2:02:05.400]  Happy birthday.
[2:02:05.400 --> 2:02:06.400]  Thank you.
[2:02:06.400 --> 2:02:07.400]  Go ahead.
[2:02:07.400 --> 2:02:11.680]  So, getting to this delegate thing, first of all, I had no idea that that's how it works,
[2:02:11.680 --> 2:02:17.400]  but after seeing that, I can already see after Hillary steals the election, you're going
[2:02:17.400 --> 2:02:23.920]  to have MSNBC and Lawrence O'Donnell coming out saying, oh, this is a very good process,
[2:02:23.920 --> 2:02:29.160]  this is very, very complicated, and it's not complicated, you stole the election from
[2:02:29.160 --> 2:02:30.160]  the man.
[2:02:30.160 --> 2:02:35.720]  If one of the people weren't, he gave him more votes than Hillary, but because the election
[2:02:35.720 --> 2:02:38.680]  is rigged, they're going to give it to Hillary.
[2:02:38.680 --> 2:02:41.880]  Why are you against women?
[2:02:41.880 --> 2:02:44.840]  I am against that woman because she is a maniac.
[2:02:44.840 --> 2:02:50.120]  I think we better, hold on a minute, we don't need sexist here on the broadcast, okay?
[2:02:50.120 --> 2:02:53.360]  Listen, listen, listen to me, big shot.
[2:02:53.360 --> 2:03:01.920]  It's trendy and liberal that if someone gets 20% more vote to have them lose, that's liberal.
[2:03:01.920 --> 2:03:05.960]  That's redistribution of delegates, and you're just afraid of a strong woman.
[2:03:05.960 --> 2:03:06.960]  Well, guess what?
[2:03:06.960 --> 2:03:11.960]  She's strong enough to take those delegates, and she's strong enough to put you in a forced
[2:03:11.960 --> 2:03:12.960]  labor camp.
[2:03:12.960 --> 2:03:13.960]  She'll show you.
[2:03:13.960 --> 2:03:18.720]  You see what she did to, you see what she does to foreign countries?
[2:03:18.720 --> 2:03:23.840]  Back in Al-Qaeda to murder 200,000 Christians in Syria, she's going to show you, boy, the
[2:03:23.840 --> 2:03:24.840]  power of women.
[2:03:24.840 --> 2:03:28.680]  Well, and that's, it's going to come down to, Al-Qaeda rapes and kills the women and
[2:03:28.680 --> 2:03:29.680]  chops their heads off.
[2:03:29.680 --> 2:03:30.680]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[2:03:30.680 --> 2:03:35.120]  It's going to come down just to the email thing after she steals the election and people
[2:03:35.120 --> 2:03:36.120]  pick a fit about it.
[2:03:36.120 --> 2:03:41.000]  They're going to come out and say, oh, they're just picking on Hillary, don't you think?
[2:03:41.000 --> 2:03:42.000]  That's right.
[2:03:42.000 --> 2:03:47.160]  And you're only mad at Obama because he reportedly has some African lineage.
[2:03:47.160 --> 2:03:48.160]  Yeah.
[2:03:48.160 --> 2:03:54.280]  Well, it's not wrong to, pardon me, select and call a spade, it's better than to pick
[2:03:54.280 --> 2:03:55.280]  a fit.
[2:03:55.280 --> 2:03:56.280]  No, no, no, no.
[2:03:56.280 --> 2:03:57.280]  See, they'll even extract and say that's racist.
[2:03:57.280 --> 2:04:05.200]  Sir, sir, sir, you need to learn to be mentally ill and like see a brown paper bag and get
[2:04:05.200 --> 2:04:12.120]  scared or not see a bathroom, you know, not be able to go in men, ands, women's or children's.
[2:04:12.120 --> 2:04:14.880]  You see, you need to freak out and have lawsuits over that.
[2:04:14.880 --> 2:04:15.880]  Okay.
[2:04:15.880 --> 2:04:19.480]  But don't sue over the NSA, spying on everything you do.
[2:04:19.480 --> 2:04:20.480]  That's okay.
[2:04:20.480 --> 2:04:24.560]  But just, just get upset all day long about something that doesn't matter.
[2:04:24.560 --> 2:04:25.560]  Okay.
[2:04:25.560 --> 2:04:26.560]  Yeah.
[2:04:26.560 --> 2:04:30.560]  Well, I'm going to the subject about having the government help raise your kids, even
[2:04:30.560 --> 2:04:38.200]  if it was the most perfectly, you know, angels running the program, you cannot write regulations
[2:04:38.200 --> 2:04:42.040]  and laws that apply to both kids in downtown New York.
[2:04:42.040 --> 2:04:46.560]  Sir, sir, sir, Bertrand Russell, the hero of the left, said, you can read his writings,
[2:04:46.560 --> 2:04:52.880]  that when they finally take over, it will be a legend that there were ever even parents.
[2:04:52.880 --> 2:04:55.200]  They will one day say it was a conspiracy theory.
[2:04:55.200 --> 2:05:00.760]  I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend.
[2:05:00.760 --> 2:05:03.360]  Oh, feel the burn again.
[2:05:03.360 --> 2:05:07.920]  Hillary Clinton's face went as green as her chartreuse chairman, Mal Pantsuit.
[2:05:07.920 --> 2:05:12.540]  When Bernie Sanders isn't talking about raising taxes and giving away free stuff, he sometimes
[2:05:12.540 --> 2:05:14.320]  makes some good points.
[2:05:14.320 --> 2:05:18.640]  Sanders noted that Kissinger paved the way for one of the worst instances of genocide
[2:05:18.640 --> 2:05:20.160]  in modern history.
[2:05:20.160 --> 2:05:24.520]  Last week, Clinton declared that she was very flattered when Henry Kissinger said, I ran
[2:05:24.520 --> 2:05:28.200]  the State Department better than anybody had run it in a long time.
[2:05:28.200 --> 2:05:33.480]  Clinton has admitted that she is working toward Kissinger's envisioned global architecture.
[2:05:33.480 --> 2:05:37.960]  But actually, we do know who earns Bernie Sanders' foreign policy praise, the Castro
[2:05:37.960 --> 2:05:41.320]  regime and Nicaragua's Sandinista government.
[2:05:41.320 --> 2:05:45.560]  Sanders gets kudos for disavowing the establishment, but in the next breath, he vowed to subvert
[2:05:45.560 --> 2:05:50.280]  the Constitution by ignoring Congress and going even further than Obama has in using
[2:05:50.280 --> 2:05:51.280]  executive action.
[2:05:51.280 --> 2:06:00.640]  Leigh Ann McAdoo reporting for infowars.com, and it's that type of behavior that spurred
[2:06:00.640 --> 2:06:06.600]  me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and
[2:06:06.600 --> 2:06:08.120]  help children focus.
[2:06:08.120 --> 2:06:13.240]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control, television, music, fast food, GMOs,
[2:06:13.240 --> 2:06:17.360]  sugars, you name it, young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are
[2:06:17.360 --> 2:06:20.760]  being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[2:06:20.760 --> 2:06:25.320]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic
[2:06:25.320 --> 2:06:26.320]  drugs.
[2:06:26.320 --> 2:06:30.240]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients
[2:06:30.240 --> 2:06:32.280]  that children would actually like and take.
[2:06:32.280 --> 2:06:35.840]  We worked with the leading manufacturer and nutritional supplements that are safe for
[2:06:35.840 --> 2:06:40.440]  children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there, introducing
[2:06:40.440 --> 2:06:45.880]  child ease with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential
[2:06:45.880 --> 2:06:47.960]  nutrients that taste great.
[2:06:47.960 --> 2:06:54.640]  In addition, your child ease today at infowarslife.com, that's child ease exclusively at infowarslife.com.
[2:06:54.640 --> 2:06:58.600]  infowarslife.com, oil of oregano formulation.
[2:06:58.600 --> 2:07:04.000]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market,
[2:07:04.000 --> 2:07:09.040]  a highly advanced nutraceutical form of this key herb that has been traditionally used
[2:07:09.040 --> 2:07:14.160]  by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health, sourced from top leading
[2:07:14.160 --> 2:07:19.800]  manufacturers to ensure a concentrated level of bioactive ingredients extracted directly
[2:07:19.800 --> 2:07:25.080]  from the wild herb and sealed in easy to use capsines, you will no longer need to endure
[2:07:25.080 --> 2:07:27.880]  the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[2:07:27.880 --> 2:07:32.560]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and
[2:07:32.560 --> 2:07:37.320]  enhance overall health, wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts
[2:07:37.320 --> 2:07:40.800]  agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[2:07:40.800 --> 2:07:46.080]  This winter season it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano,
[2:07:46.080 --> 2:08:12.880]  now available at infowarslife.com, that's infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[2:08:12.880 --> 2:08:20.360]  But because of those who look on and do nothing, if you are receiving this transmission, you
[2:08:20.360 --> 2:08:26.880]  are the resistance, we now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, it's Alex
[2:08:26.880 --> 2:08:27.880]  Jones.
[2:08:27.880 --> 2:08:35.880]  For 20 years I've had the liner on radio that we're broadcasting from deep behind occupied
[2:08:35.880 --> 2:08:36.880]  territory.
[2:08:36.880 --> 2:08:46.720]  And I did that on purpose, I did that because I've studied history, a lot of folks got into
[2:08:46.720 --> 2:08:52.000]  Louis Lamour books or they got into Conan the Barbarian books or they got into Spider-Man
[2:08:52.000 --> 2:09:01.080]  comics and I read those two until I was about 10, then I started reading Pulitzer Prize winning
[2:09:01.080 --> 2:09:05.760]  books on World War II and I started reading the actual books written by Roman Senators
[2:09:05.760 --> 2:09:10.520]  2000 years ago, by the time I was about 16 I'd read probably 500 history books, I was
[2:09:10.520 --> 2:09:16.600]  addicted to it and when I knew history then I looked at what was happening in America
[2:09:16.600 --> 2:09:23.000]  in my high school and then in college and I said this is unbelievable totalitarianism.
[2:09:23.000 --> 2:09:28.200]  I was in college and I had read a book on Mao and how he killed 80 plus million people,
[2:09:28.200 --> 2:09:32.600]  that particular book was written by a Chinese American, by the way the Chinese admit he
[2:09:32.600 --> 2:09:39.440]  killed 80 plus million, our CIA thinks 60 something million.
[2:09:39.440 --> 2:09:45.400]  And then what he taught and what he did and his slogans were being used at the college
[2:09:45.400 --> 2:09:46.400]  here in Austin.
[2:09:46.400 --> 2:09:51.480]  So then when you see Obama with his hand forward like Lenin saying forward and they use all
[2:09:51.480 --> 2:09:59.080]  the exact communist terms on MSNBC, it's in our face folks, but I want to explain something,
[2:09:59.080 --> 2:10:04.120]  this isn't communism, they're using communism as a totalitarian operating system because
[2:10:04.120 --> 2:10:08.560]  much of the American left in the last century was influenced by it.
[2:10:08.560 --> 2:10:14.640]  The American left before that was Thomas Jefferson, it meant more freedom, more self-defense,
[2:10:14.640 --> 2:10:19.680]  lower taxes and yes, more civil freedoms.
[2:10:19.680 --> 2:10:26.320]  The left was a Christian abolitionist ending slavery, so they so inverted reality, I don't
[2:10:26.320 --> 2:10:31.360]  even know what to call these people anymore, but now the Department of Education openly
[2:10:31.360 --> 2:10:38.720]  says they're going to send social workers at birth until you're 18 and quote, co-parent.
[2:10:38.720 --> 2:10:40.720]  These are quotes.
[2:10:40.720 --> 2:10:45.480]  They're openly saying the doctors will ask your kids about guns in the house.
[2:10:45.480 --> 2:10:47.760]  This is the Stasi society.
[2:10:47.760 --> 2:10:53.080]  The left is on TV and the right calling for war with Russia.
[2:10:53.080 --> 2:10:57.120]  Those are saying let's more body bags in Republican candidates saying let's bloody their noses,
[2:10:57.120 --> 2:11:04.160]  let's shoot down Russian jets and then if you go to drudgereport.com, our stories top
[2:11:04.160 --> 2:11:12.280]  linked, burn like hell, Satanist rally behind socialist Bernie Sanders and folks, when we
[2:11:12.280 --> 2:11:16.680]  go out and protest at the local abortion clinic of the baby body parts being sold, you notice
[2:11:16.680 --> 2:11:23.240]  quote, anarchist showed up who then had mal-installed tattoos and then announced we're Satanist
[2:11:23.240 --> 2:11:29.040]  actually and in my experience, they were black, they were white, they were Hispanic, but they
[2:11:29.040 --> 2:11:33.280]  all were like shriveled and hateful.
[2:11:33.280 --> 2:11:39.440]  You've seen the video, it went viral and we're just screaming and yelling and spitting and
[2:11:39.440 --> 2:11:45.880]  grabbing our signs and but also stumbling around and I'm not trying to be dramatic here.
[2:11:45.880 --> 2:11:50.080]  I want to ask Lou Rockwell, a preeminent, libertarian, intellectual, bestselling author,
[2:11:50.080 --> 2:11:53.240]  formerly Ron Paul, chief of staff, one of the top guys over at the Von Mies Institute,
[2:11:53.240 --> 2:11:57.600]  and we're going to take your calls later in the hour for folks that are holding, that
[2:11:57.600 --> 2:12:02.920]  it seems you're reaching a critical mass where there's a method to the establishment's madness,
[2:12:02.920 --> 2:12:08.520]  but they are going insane in front of us and so many criminals, if you study criminology,
[2:12:08.520 --> 2:12:11.400]  serial killers will do a great job, the first four or five people, but usually then they
[2:12:11.400 --> 2:12:12.840]  get real reckless.
[2:12:12.840 --> 2:12:17.040]  They start sending clues to the police, they get drunk while they're out driving around
[2:12:17.040 --> 2:12:21.920]  kidnapping women and they finally get caught and that's what's crazy is just the statements
[2:12:21.920 --> 2:12:26.760]  of Hillary going, I came, I saw, he died and I'm going to take the delegates that I want
[2:12:26.760 --> 2:12:34.520]  from Sanders and just the nakedness of these people, but like catch me if you can, I'm
[2:12:34.520 --> 2:12:41.680]  the gingerbread man, it's dangerous and the announcements that our kids belong to them
[2:12:41.680 --> 2:12:47.880]  and you're going to get this free and that free and they're so crazed looking, I mean
[2:12:47.880 --> 2:12:51.560]  I don't judge people by how they look, but I mean Hillary looks like a female version
[2:12:51.560 --> 2:12:58.000]  of the Joker, the cackling, I mean I expect she'll jump on a broom any minute, she's
[2:12:58.000 --> 2:13:03.320]  a war criminal and then all these weird Democrats, all these men and women going, I'm voting
[2:13:03.320 --> 2:13:08.840]  for her because she's a woman, it's just so vapid, I believe we've reached critical mass
[2:13:08.840 --> 2:13:13.480]  with statism, it is declining, people are waking up, but only those that are thinkers,
[2:13:13.480 --> 2:13:14.960]  we're winning the war.
[2:13:14.960 --> 2:13:19.000]  In the news department, but in the entertainment department, that's what the real cultural
[2:13:19.000 --> 2:13:23.280]  brainwashing is and I don't know if we're winning overall, we're winning some battles
[2:13:23.280 --> 2:13:27.280]  but I got to tell you when it clicked and then Joe Biggs this morning and we're going
[2:13:27.280 --> 2:13:30.240]  to our guest said, you didn't know about this?
[2:13:30.240 --> 2:13:34.520]  I said no and he goes, yeah the memes are everywhere, it's well known, not just the
[2:13:34.520 --> 2:13:41.840]  communist slogans, but Hillary in all the debates now wears the exact style dresses
[2:13:41.840 --> 2:13:45.040]  that Mao Zedong's life wore.
[2:13:45.040 --> 2:13:50.880]  I mean they go down to the color tie with top experts and focus groups, I mean it's
[2:13:50.880 --> 2:14:00.240]  just, it's too weird, again forward and Obama points as linen and their slogans and lean
[2:14:00.240 --> 2:14:06.920]  forward, it's direct Bolshevik revolution stuff and it's just so surreal, I keep expecting
[2:14:06.920 --> 2:14:11.840]  Rod Serling to walk out smoking a cigarette and tell me this is a 3D version of the Twilight
[2:14:11.840 --> 2:14:16.920]  Zone because I don't have words at this point to describe how sick this has gotten.
[2:14:16.920 --> 2:14:20.920]  We interviewed him last week, I'm probably six months, it's great to have him back, our
[2:14:20.920 --> 2:14:25.480]  own Kit Daniels went down to a Von Mies Institute event, talked to him and to tell, also talked
[2:14:25.480 --> 2:14:31.880]  to former congressman Ron Paul, Lou Rockwell, LouRockwell.com, excellent news site as well
[2:14:31.880 --> 2:14:36.320]  and again I can't go over all of his bio, it would take too long, but he's the chairman
[2:14:36.320 --> 2:14:41.720]  of the Lubavon Mies Institute, Austrian Economics, the answer to current capitalism in my view
[2:14:41.720 --> 2:14:45.760]  and of course he served as Ron Paul's Chief of Staff and a lot more, he was also the Republican
[2:14:45.760 --> 2:14:52.360]  Party nomination, he ran that exploratory committee for Ron Paul as well and I'm gonna
[2:14:52.360 --> 2:14:58.320]  stop right there sir, I mean you've heard my preface but I'm asking you, you know as
[2:14:58.320 --> 2:15:05.240]  a knowledgeable statesman in the fight for human dignity, what is this hallucination
[2:15:05.240 --> 2:15:10.120]  we're witnessing, is this the death throes, is it a tenter tantrum or do you disagree
[2:15:10.120 --> 2:15:17.440]  with me or are we seeing just bizarre displays of collectivist mental illness because it just
[2:15:17.440 --> 2:15:22.920]  gets, you know, ban the word father and mother, ban the words founding fathers, you, she,
[2:15:22.920 --> 2:15:28.840]  or thee, I mean it's beyond any cult, if I write a novel about a cult like this I wouldn't
[2:15:28.840 --> 2:15:34.760]  believe it, I mean it's cult programming, what do you say to that rant sir?
[2:15:34.760 --> 2:15:39.800]  Well it is crazy and I somehow think it's the neocons, I mean I can't believe that
[2:15:39.800 --> 2:15:45.240]  sometimes I miss the Rockefeller world empire, as evil as they were, they didn't actually
[2:15:45.240 --> 2:15:50.600]  seem to be insane, this bunch is insane, I don't care whether it's Hillary or it's
[2:15:50.600 --> 2:15:59.280]  the Republican version, Rubio and Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz and of course Bernie Sanders,
[2:15:59.280 --> 2:16:05.680]  there are a lot of crazy people, warmongers, people who clearly lust for shedding of blood,
[2:16:05.680 --> 2:16:11.080]  they lust for the shedding of blood of others, they lust too for the shedding of the blood
[2:16:11.080 --> 2:16:17.240]  of Americans too, so it's absolutely true they're sort of revealing their true selves,
[2:16:17.240 --> 2:16:22.800]  they do seem to be reveling in their victories and they are, they aren't enforcing insane
[2:16:22.800 --> 2:16:28.880]  policies, I mean can you believe that they talk about mandating the registration of women
[2:16:28.880 --> 2:16:34.800]  for the draft and according to the poll anyway 61% of American men went along with this,
[2:16:34.800 --> 2:16:39.840]  I mean that's insane too, why and you know of course in some sense we can see the regime
[2:16:39.840 --> 2:16:46.640]  in these sorts of activities wanting to make men into women and women into men, and that
[2:16:46.640 --> 2:16:50.880]  goes along with all what you're talking about, the pronouns and getting rid of mothers and
[2:16:50.880 --> 2:16:56.440]  fathers, not having boys and girls sections in toy stores or boys and girls sections in
[2:16:56.440 --> 2:17:02.400]  clothing departments, everything has to be the same or rather the same, what did Facebook
[2:17:02.400 --> 2:17:08.600]  say that there were 65 genders that you could choose among for your own on Facebook?
[2:17:08.600 --> 2:17:17.160]  So it's, this goes right along with the crazed statism, they are just reveling in their power
[2:17:17.160 --> 2:17:20.360]  and of course these are people who love to do this to human beings, they just love to
[2:17:20.360 --> 2:17:25.800]  bomb, they love to kill, love to crush, they love to dominate, they love to lie to us,
[2:17:25.800 --> 2:17:30.880]  they love to take our children away and they like to destroy our communities, Robert Nisbitt
[2:17:30.880 --> 2:17:37.000]  the great libertarian socialist, excuse me sociologist pointed out that the state seeks
[2:17:37.000 --> 2:17:42.200]  to destroy every what he called intermediating institution, that is everything that stands
[2:17:42.200 --> 2:17:47.520]  between, he said the naked individual and state power, they want to get rid of states
[2:17:47.520 --> 2:17:51.880]  as versus the fed, they want to get rid of communities, they want to get rid of businesses
[2:17:51.880 --> 2:17:56.320]  of churches, ultimately they want to get rid of the family, they want to get rid of parents
[2:17:56.320 --> 2:18:00.400]  and this is of course Plato's dream, this has been an ancient dream of these people,
[2:18:00.400 --> 2:18:01.400]  this is nothing new.
[2:18:01.400 --> 2:18:05.280]  That's why I love getting you on because we can say the French Revolution and the Jacobins
[2:18:05.280 --> 2:18:10.600]  trying to hijack the liberty movement was the most modern roots of communism but really
[2:18:10.600 --> 2:18:17.200]  it goes back to Plato and his plan to raise us like cattle and in the family itself but
[2:18:17.200 --> 2:18:22.520]  then he would write the allegory of the cave supposedly responding to his own vision but
[2:18:22.520 --> 2:18:28.160]  he really is their god, he really is their model, how is their plan going and of course
[2:18:28.160 --> 2:18:32.520]  I think you had a Freudian slip there because I know you've written about the so-called
[2:18:32.520 --> 2:18:40.600]  democratic socialism not existing or libertarian socialism of Bernie Sanders, I mean I don't
[2:18:40.600 --> 2:18:44.520]  want to hate Sanders and it's true he's not owned by a crony capitalist but I mean he's
[2:18:44.520 --> 2:18:47.400]  got to know socialism as a disaster.
[2:18:47.400 --> 2:18:52.440]  Well he says some good things and the debate with Hillary the other night he accused her
[2:18:52.440 --> 2:18:57.560]  of being pals with Kissinger and as you say talked about Kissinger having caused the
[2:18:57.560 --> 2:19:02.720]  genocide in Cambodia and by the way that's just the beginning of Kissinger's war crimes
[2:19:02.720 --> 2:19:07.120]  as a very bad man, man and Bernie might have pointed out he's a big crony capitalist on
[2:19:07.120 --> 2:19:12.200]  Wall Street too, very very bad guy and he was right to point out that Hillary's connected
[2:19:12.200 --> 2:19:13.200]  with him.
[2:19:13.200 --> 2:19:17.600]  On the other hand Bernie himself is clearly a neocon, you only had to hear him talk last
[2:19:17.600 --> 2:19:23.640]  night about the alleged threat from Russia and why the US needs to, he practically called
[2:19:23.640 --> 2:19:29.720]  for a nuclear war with Russia, so this guy is no anti-war guy, he's not a peace guy,
[2:19:29.720 --> 2:19:35.080]  he reminds me that the neocons were originally Altraskiites, now they sort of moved away
[2:19:35.080 --> 2:19:38.880]  from that or pretend to move away from it, he's a throwback to the original neocon.
[2:19:38.880 --> 2:19:42.440]  Again talk about Twilight Zone, you just throw that out there, it's totally true, it's even
[2:19:42.440 --> 2:19:47.080]  been in the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, it's not debatable that the entire
[2:19:47.080 --> 2:19:55.480]  neocon command base got run out of Russia, their leader got killed with a ISACS in Mexico,
[2:19:55.480 --> 2:20:00.840]  Trotsky, and then they ran up here and took over the whole Republican movement and National
[2:20:00.840 --> 2:20:05.320]  Review and the CIA brought them in and then sent them into Chicago Business School and
[2:20:05.320 --> 2:20:09.920]  now they're back, they're all after Donald Trump, now obviously Donald's not perfect,
[2:20:09.920 --> 2:20:14.920]  he says some stuff that I disagree with, but at the same time I think it's him playing
[2:20:14.920 --> 2:20:19.200]  politics with Bernie, it's a little bit different because of the neocon background than hating
[2:20:19.200 --> 2:20:23.600]  Russia so much, which he just astutely spoke to, so maybe get into some background on that,
[2:20:23.600 --> 2:20:29.600]  but Trump and Bernie though, being so popular despite what mainstream media does, shows
[2:20:29.600 --> 2:20:36.960]  me that this is a emblematic gauge or weather vane, bellwether of the fact that there is
[2:20:36.960 --> 2:20:41.280]  a true uprising against the establishment taking place right now, Lou Rockwell.
[2:20:41.280 --> 2:20:45.040]  Well, Trump says a lot of good things, he says a lot of bad things, he doesn't have
[2:20:45.040 --> 2:20:49.760]  a theory, I mean there always need to be intellectuals in any movement like this, it can't just
[2:20:49.760 --> 2:20:54.800]  be one guy spouting off, there has to be a considered plan, there has to be a considered
[2:20:54.800 --> 2:20:59.960]  strategy and unfortunately that's lacking, and on the other hand his support I would
[2:20:59.960 --> 2:21:08.320]  say is by and large a very good thing, Bernie's support, I don't know to what extent when
[2:21:08.320 --> 2:21:11.920]  he was talking about Kissinger, last night I wondered how many of his millennials have
[2:21:11.920 --> 2:21:18.160]  even heard of Kissinger, let alone know its significance, but I was glad he did it, on
[2:21:18.160 --> 2:21:23.200]  the other hand I think he's fundamentally a very bad guy, obviously Hillary is a very
[2:21:23.200 --> 2:21:30.320]  bad person, all the Republicans are pretty bad and Trump is sometimes good, sometimes
[2:21:30.320 --> 2:21:35.400]  bad, but just the fact that these guys are both hated by the establishment, I don't
[2:21:35.400 --> 2:21:40.880]  know to what extent the hatred of Bernie is real as versus manufactured, not that they
[2:21:40.880 --> 2:21:45.800]  wouldn't rather have Hillary, but I think they could do just fine with Sanders, socialism,
[2:21:45.800 --> 2:21:51.400]  yeah socialism is a disaster, he's not a classic socialist, he doesn't want the government
[2:21:51.400 --> 2:21:55.520]  to own the means of production, he simply wants them controlled by the government, this
[2:21:55.520 --> 2:22:00.600]  is more properly described actually as fascism, that's right he's more of a fascist, socialism,
[2:22:00.600 --> 2:22:07.360]  and he's not a civil libertarian, he wants the entire social justice warrior program
[2:22:07.360 --> 2:22:13.320]  put into place, he wants egalitarianism enforced on society, he wants everybody made equal
[2:22:13.320 --> 2:22:17.520]  by the state, and this is something that comes out, you talked about the French Revolution
[2:22:17.520 --> 2:22:22.560]  although we can trace it back to the Grockeye in ancient Rome that has earlier roots, the
[2:22:22.560 --> 2:22:27.840]  notion that the state can make everybody equal, now since nobody is equal, Mises said that
[2:22:27.840 --> 2:22:32.400]  the key fact about the human race is our radical inequality, and he said thank goodness because
[2:22:32.400 --> 2:22:36.160]  if we weren't unequal, we were all identical, there couldn't be a market, there couldn't
[2:22:36.160 --> 2:22:40.200]  be social cooperation, there couldn't even be civilization, so inequality is not only
[2:22:40.200 --> 2:22:45.120]  a natural thing, a fundamental thing, but it's a good thing, but ever since especially
[2:22:45.120 --> 2:22:49.640]  the French Revolution these people have argued the state should make us equal, since that's
[2:22:49.640 --> 2:22:54.600]  actually impossible, it gives all power to the state, so you can't, you have to believe
[2:22:54.600 --> 2:22:59.800]  it, and all you do is create a psychotic ruling class that didn't even get there by being
[2:22:59.800 --> 2:23:04.600]  some conquering king who at least had some attributes that he was a more manipulative
[2:23:04.600 --> 2:23:11.040]  smarter, you know, systematic controller, that's a horrible system as well, but instead the
[2:23:11.040 --> 2:23:18.080]  most weaseling croves of interloping sycophants get in control and then just start growing
[2:23:18.080 --> 2:23:25.160]  their system like a cancer, have they gone too far though with screaming at their professors
[2:23:25.160 --> 2:23:29.560]  and then the professors are fired because they dare say don't ban costume parties, I
[2:23:29.560 --> 2:23:36.800]  mean is this level of just savage attacks on free speech, could that jolt what's left
[2:23:36.800 --> 2:23:42.760]  to the old left back into their senses or will they just circle the wagons on a power
[2:23:42.760 --> 2:23:49.200]  trip and say no we need totalitarianism to create our utopia, because I see so much of
[2:23:49.200 --> 2:23:55.040]  the main line left really becoming pure mercenaries of globalist and saying no we are totalitarian,
[2:23:55.040 --> 2:23:59.520]  I mean I remember a few years ago the editor of the Financial Times of London came out and
[2:23:59.520 --> 2:24:03.440]  he said and he named myself and others, but he said in two different articles he said
[2:24:03.440 --> 2:24:07.640]  okay we are totalitarian, we are taking over, it is a planetary government and we're smarter
[2:24:07.640 --> 2:24:12.360]  than you and so we're going to do this, we deserve because we're smarter to rule you
[2:24:12.360 --> 2:24:15.320]  and so to rule us because they're so smart though they got to teach us the two plus
[2:24:15.320 --> 2:24:22.720]  two equals five, so our kids are so fundamentally screwed up and know 60 plus genders and are
[2:24:22.720 --> 2:24:26.880]  obsessed with which potty they use instead of knowing how to read classical literature,
[2:24:26.880 --> 2:24:33.520]  I mean what type of elite sabotages the brain of humanity so they can rule a madhouse of
[2:24:33.520 --> 2:24:39.080]  morons, I mean that doesn't sound like an elite to me Mr. Rockwell.
[2:24:39.080 --> 2:24:43.800]  Well it's an elite, I mean that they want to rule all the rest of us and they think
[2:24:43.800 --> 2:24:49.120]  that by all the immigration policies, all their economic policies, all their social
[2:24:49.120 --> 2:24:59.760]  policies they can make everybody unhappy, make them frustrated, make them depressed and not
[2:24:59.760 --> 2:25:06.120]  resist, so they feel that even though the average production ability of the average
[2:25:06.120 --> 2:25:14.480]  American may go down in all of it together, there's still plenty for them to, and there
[2:25:14.480 --> 2:25:21.520]  is a satanic element too, they actually like evil, you know with some of these elite groups
[2:25:21.520 --> 2:25:28.360]  that you've exposed, people worship pagan gods and this is not, it sounds like a joke,
[2:25:28.360 --> 2:25:34.440]  it sounds like a bad joke, but they are attracted to evil and to Satan and so forth, yes.
[2:25:34.440 --> 2:25:39.760]  Well we're all, you always come right from the heart of it, you always come, please continue
[2:25:39.760 --> 2:25:44.560]  on that line because I was brought up a Christian, I believe in God, but I wasn't a strong Christian
[2:25:44.560 --> 2:25:48.600]  you'd call it that, and I was like you know devil, okay kind of a bad energy in the universe
[2:25:48.600 --> 2:25:53.760]  whatever, but the more I studied the globalist elites and what they're involved in and then
[2:25:53.760 --> 2:26:00.720]  criminology, how psychopaths usually end up actually being into Satanism, whether God's
[2:26:00.720 --> 2:26:05.720]  real or not for the sake of argument for atheists, still in criminology and psychology there is
[2:26:05.720 --> 2:26:12.640]  a manifestation, the Nazis were into the occult, Lenin was into the occult, they shell us that
[2:26:12.640 --> 2:26:17.240]  oh there's no God because they want to have the state be God as you pointed out, but really
[2:26:17.240 --> 2:26:22.120]  behind closed doors they're into occultism, please elaborate on that and why you think
[2:26:22.120 --> 2:26:27.600]  Satanist across America, the stories on DrudgeReport.com are such big supporters of Bernie, I thought
[2:26:27.600 --> 2:26:32.800]  a real Satanist, you know they claim Anton Leves style is all about empowering the individual
[2:26:32.800 --> 2:26:37.720]  and doing what you want, do as thou wilt is the whole law, but no it isn't really that
[2:26:37.720 --> 2:26:42.160]  is it, you shell people on joining your cult, you're going to have fun, but really you're
[2:26:42.160 --> 2:26:45.120]  going to be slaves on Satan's plantation, will you Rockwell?
[2:26:45.120 --> 2:26:49.280]  Well of course and even though they said do as thou wilt you're not allowed to do as
[2:26:49.280 --> 2:26:57.080]  thou wilt, you have to do what they want and you know this is a very warped people, are
[2:26:57.080 --> 2:27:05.360]  they, does the Satan respond to this sort of thing, I mean they actually, somehow communicated
[2:27:05.360 --> 2:27:12.760]  with him, that I don't know, but they would like to be and they are self-consciously pro-evil,
[2:27:12.760 --> 2:27:20.460]  so they enjoy killing and they enjoy all kinds of horrible practices with other human beings
[2:27:20.460 --> 2:27:26.920]  that they engage in, some of these cults really horrendous and of course they're all leftist
[2:27:26.920 --> 2:27:31.280]  and I don't think you asked earlier, can we count on the left, I don't think so, I think
[2:27:31.280 --> 2:27:36.360]  the left has to be entirely rejected, I remember the last time I talked to Noam Chomsky, guys
[2:27:36.360 --> 2:27:42.440]  written a lot of good stuff, this was during the 2008 campaign and he was very very anti-Ron
[2:27:42.440 --> 2:27:47.360]  Paul and he told me he would support Hillary over Ron Paul, this is an alleged anti-war
[2:27:47.360 --> 2:27:53.800]  guy and you know why was that, well it's because they hate private property and they hate everything
[2:27:53.800 --> 2:27:58.000]  that stems from private property, private property is essential to the family, it's
[2:27:58.000 --> 2:28:03.160]  essential to economic life, it's essential to human civilization, they want to smash
[2:28:03.160 --> 2:28:10.720]  it all, they're far worse than anybody in Orwell's 1984 and of course they've got unbelievable
[2:28:10.720 --> 2:28:15.920]  technology to spy on us, the government now admits that the whole point of the internet
[2:28:15.920 --> 2:28:22.560]  of things is to spy on us in our homes, they're spying on us to an extent that Hitler or Stalin
[2:28:22.560 --> 2:28:28.360]  or a big brother in Orwell never could have dreamed of and they're still not satisfied,
[2:28:28.360 --> 2:28:32.360]  they're still pushing, they want to get rid of cash, they're better to control us.
[2:28:32.360 --> 2:28:36.720]  Oh I've talked to a lot of top leftists as you have and if you're having dinner with
[2:28:36.720 --> 2:28:39.880]  them they'll admit it, they'll go listen, I know the government's staging false flags,
[2:28:39.880 --> 2:28:42.760]  I know they're bringing the drugs in, I know they're doing all these bad things but it's
[2:28:42.760 --> 2:28:46.040]  going to be our government when we finally get control of it so we want it to be as big
[2:28:46.040 --> 2:28:50.560]  as possible and you're right, they see anybody with their own property, that's why they have
[2:28:50.560 --> 2:28:55.000]  a war on lemonade stands and farmers markets in the Amish, they just see any normal independent

[2:29:24.440 --> 2:29:29.760]  unbelievably evil and those of us who are working against this who are opposed to it
[2:29:29.760 --> 2:29:35.000]  must never forget that we're working against people who are thoroughly evil with a capital
