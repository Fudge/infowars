[00:00.000 --> 00:15.000]  Oh oppression, you prey on us when we sleep
[00:15.000 --> 00:21.000]  Oh oppression, you chase after the tired all the week
[00:21.000 --> 00:28.000]  Oh oppression, you know you mean only harm
[00:28.000 --> 00:34.000]  Oh oppression, you reach out with your long heart
[00:34.000 --> 00:39.000]  But oppression, I won't let you near me
[00:39.000 --> 00:46.000]  Oh no, oppression, you shall learn to fear me
[00:46.000 --> 00:54.000]  Yes you will, oppression, you seek population control
[00:54.000 --> 01:00.000]  Oh oppression, to divide and to conquer is your goal
[01:00.000 --> 01:07.000]  Oh oppression, I swear that hatred is your home
[01:07.000 --> 01:13.000]  Oh oppression, you just won't leave bad enough alone
[01:13.000 --> 01:22.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live. It is Sunday, the 7th day of November, 2010
[01:22.000 --> 01:30.000]  We're going to be live here for the next two hours. Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:30.000 --> 01:37.000]  Later in the second hour, I'm going to get into the huge developments dealing with dollar devaluation.
[01:37.000 --> 01:49.000]  It's already affecting the value of the currency and the T-bills that are sold to all of these foreign corporations, individuals and mainly governments.
[01:49.000 --> 01:59.000]  They have to destroy our dollar before they can put us on to the new SDR system and that's what the quantitative easing is all about.
[01:59.000 --> 02:13.000]  It also makes the big private central banks that have engineered this crisis flush with trillions of dollars of more money as it's being devalued so that they can purchase real assets, stocks and bonds, companies, media, you name it.
[02:13.000 --> 02:21.000]  Then we have to pay taxes back to the bankers for our money that they get to use against us.
[02:21.000 --> 02:30.000]  That is all coming up. We'll also look at the imperial presidency of the puppet Barack Obama on his Asia trip.
[02:30.000 --> 02:38.000]  He's going to be in Seoul, South Korea in the next few days, part of his 10-day trip then on to Indonesia and Japan.
[02:38.000 --> 02:50.000]  There is a big revolt going on by China and others openly saying that they are very angry about the decision to devalue the dollar that they hold over a trillion, $200 billion of.
[02:50.000 --> 03:02.000]  The next biggest owner, of course, of the private debt that the private banks have created, that they try to foist on us, is the Federal Reserve.
[03:02.000 --> 03:05.000]  So that is coming up as well.
[03:05.000 --> 03:10.000]  I also saw several articles today about taser deaths.
[03:10.000 --> 03:14.000]  More people being tasered and dying. The system just doesn't care.
[03:14.000 --> 03:20.000]  Just like they don't care if the troops are dead and dying from the depleted uranium.
[03:20.000 --> 03:30.000]  This is a group of eugenicists. That's why they're caught all the time testing chemicals, biologicals, radiologicals on men, women and children.
[03:30.000 --> 03:37.000]  All over the world shooting people up with live polio or live syphilis.
[03:37.000 --> 03:44.000]  They're doing this by design for population control and to test it and see if they can get away with it.
[03:44.000 --> 03:52.000]  So we're going to be discussing that and how it shows how the precedent has just been set that our lives don't have value.
[03:52.000 --> 04:02.000]  Former Bart Kopp gets two years in Oscar Grant killing. The minimum sentence shot him in the back execution style.
[04:02.000 --> 04:08.000]  Then they kind of roughed him up after they shot him in the back, grabbed him, said, you know, get up. How dare you be shot in the back?
[04:08.000 --> 04:11.000]  It's all your fault. The guy was in handcuffs. They lied about that.
[04:11.000 --> 04:20.000]  They tried to confiscate the video cameras from people that were there on the deck at the train station.
[04:20.000 --> 04:25.000]  But another train had stopped and got video. So there's also the attempted cover up there.
[04:25.000 --> 04:33.000]  We'll be looking at that. But the first thing I want to hit is the police state control grid, namely naked body scanners.
[04:33.000 --> 04:41.000]  For two days, the dredge report, one of its top links has been our video. TSA fondles women and children refusing airport naked body scanners.
[04:41.000 --> 04:49.000]  And some people are in denial about this. We're going to cover the facts when we come back. Stay with us.
[04:49.000 --> 04:55.000]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over. It ended on June of 2009.
[04:55.000 --> 05:02.000]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree. Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees,
[05:02.000 --> 05:07.000]  but for the rest of us, things seemed to be getting worse. Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[05:07.000 --> 05:13.000]  They've begun their long expected journey to the moon. In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver,
[05:13.000 --> 05:19.000]  you should consider a food savings account from eFoodsDirect. They both make fabulous investments.
[05:19.000 --> 05:24.000]  Food is our greatest dependency and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[05:24.000 --> 05:29.000]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks or metals.
[05:29.000 --> 05:35.000]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.
[05:35.000 --> 05:44.000]  You'll freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it. Visit eFoodsDirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[05:44.000 --> 06:09.000]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show because there's a war on for your mind.
[06:09.000 --> 06:20.000]  This is going to be an extremely important transmission today. It is vital that you listen very carefully to the information I'm about to cover,
[06:20.000 --> 06:28.000]  that you take notes on everything I talk about and that you check it out for yourself.
[06:28.000 --> 06:39.000]  It has been declassified over 200 times, including army field manuals that are supposed government.
[06:39.000 --> 06:47.000]  Stages, terrorist attacks in this country and other nations as a pretext to expand their agenda.
[06:47.000 --> 06:55.000]  And what is their agenda? The United States since 1913 has been seized by the private Federal Reserve.
[06:55.000 --> 07:03.000]  But they haven't had total control of this country's economic and political policy, but for the last 40 or so.
[07:03.000 --> 07:14.000]  We have been used to build up the private global corporate government. We have been indebted. We have been hated worldwide because of it.
[07:14.000 --> 07:24.000]  Domestic propaganda has basically brainwashed much of the public to go along with this and to think that, quote, we are the good guys.
[07:24.000 --> 07:31.000]  Well, the average American is good and does mean well and is frankly quite naive and sappy.
[07:31.000 --> 07:45.000]  But the major power players in both parties and the CIA and the FBI at the highest levels have been caught engaged in every form of institutional corruption, you can imagine.
[07:45.000 --> 07:55.000]  It was declassified in 96. They had C-SPAN hearings in Congress where the CIA Inspector General admitted the CIA ships in cocaine and heroin.
[07:55.000 --> 08:03.000]  Now it's on Fox News that, yes, our government helps grow the opium in Afghanistan. It's at record levels, but it's a good thing to do.
[08:03.000 --> 08:08.000]  The CIA now admits they created fake bin Laden videos.
[08:08.000 --> 08:21.000]  The government now admits that they signed a secret deal 11 years ago to take the death benefits of 6 million dead and dying veterans from World War II right through to Desert Storm.
[08:21.000 --> 08:24.000]  That's Bloomberg.
[08:24.000 --> 08:41.000]  We have people more corrupt than Ken Lay, more corrupt than the Gambino crime family, more corrupt than people like Bernie Madoff running our society and our major courts, and they get away with murder.
[08:41.000 --> 08:59.000]  Simultaneously, all of these draconian laws are being passed to basically criminalize the entire population of the United States to institutionalize us. If they can't bankrupt us or get us in the mental health system, they want to get us in the criminal justice system.
[08:59.000 --> 09:07.000]  They want you under their control. America went bad. Most other countries in history go bad.
[09:07.000 --> 09:17.000]  And when people can't recognize evil anymore, when people can't face evil, societies degenerate into total tyranny.
[09:17.000 --> 09:29.000]  Now the good news is, according to every poll, every study out there, the population of this country is starting to awaken. The sleeping giant is beginning to awaken, and that's very positive.
[09:29.000 --> 09:37.000]  All right, I want to give you a preview of what's coming up today. And then I'm going to launch into it. Okay?
[09:37.000 --> 09:52.000]  Everything we're going to cover is at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com and is direct links to mainstream news, government legislation, and mainline corporate trade publications.
[09:52.000 --> 10:05.000]  100% of what we're going to cover today is all documented and on record. And more than that, I'm not just going to cover all these news articles and back up everything I say.
[10:05.000 --> 10:24.000]  We are streaming live video at prisonplanet.tv. We're not just on the radio, where when I say I have a New York Times article, or when I say I have a CNBC article, or when I say I have the Patriot Act in front of me, I have it in front of me.
[10:24.000 --> 10:37.000]  And you will be able to see the news articles because I'm always blown away by the intense level of denial.
[10:37.000 --> 10:50.000]  When I talk about government-sponsored terror, and this is coming up later in the hour, I have read to you the scores of Republican analysts in newspaper articles saying
[10:50.000 --> 11:00.000]  that to continue the war on terror and to take people's rights and to continue the elite's agenda, there needs to be giant terror attacks in America.
[11:00.000 --> 11:17.000]  I have the September 20, 2000 PNAC documents. You can go to their own website and read them written by Dick Cheney, where they said we need 3,000 dead at least, a new Pearl Harbor type event to galvanize the American people to fund this world government empire.
[11:17.000 --> 11:33.000]  Now, in the last three months, I've been warning people that Obama's controllers are going to stage events as a pretext for us to give up our liberties and to see the government as our protectors while they rob us blind and devalue the dollar.
[11:33.000 --> 11:49.000]  Last week I covered financial times of London. Obama faces growing credibility crisis. Quote, the bottom line here is that Americans don't believe in President Obama's leadership, says Robert Shapiro, former Clinton official and supporter and advisor of Obama.
[11:49.000 --> 11:56.000]  He has defined some way between now and November of demonstrating that he is a leader who can command confidence.
[11:56.000 --> 12:09.000]  And short of a new 9-11 event or an Oklahoma City bombing, I can't think of how he can do that. And then we wrote an article about it at prisonplanet.com going through all the other Obama advisors and minions saying the same thing.
[12:09.000 --> 12:32.000]  Here's a new one today that's in the AP Raw Story, MSNBC, CNN, and infowars.com. And I'll show you a document cam shot of this. X Clinton strategist, Obama needs event similar to OKC to reconnect with voters.
[12:32.000 --> 12:39.000]  Now I'm not just going to read the quote, I'm going to play you the MSNBC video clip of him saying it.
[12:39.000 --> 12:54.000]  Now do you understand that WikiLeaks released in 2007 a 2004 Army manual for black op commander captains and above where it teaches them how to stage terror attacks and blaming on foreign enemies overseas.
[12:54.000 --> 13:04.000]  It's the oldest trick in the book. You go kill a village, blame it on your enemy. The way they tried our military to do it is they said, look, the communists do it, we've got to do it.
[13:04.000 --> 13:12.000]  Fight fire with fire. And the minute you do that, the minute you torture people because other countries torture, you lose your soul.
[13:12.000 --> 13:19.000]  Here's the infowars.com article. Clintonite, Obama needs OKC bombing to reconnect with the American people. That's a quote.
[13:19.000 --> 13:30.000]  Now, that said, we just had the one year anniversary Friday of Major Hassan murdering 13 people.
[13:30.000 --> 13:39.000]  We reported at the time that Major Hassan was videotaped with another shooter. That's what eyewitnesses told us, including sources inside Fort Hood.
[13:39.000 --> 13:42.000]  I'll leave it at that. It's now been admitted in the court trial. That was true.
[13:42.000 --> 13:49.000]  It also came out at the time that for two years he was in contact with Anwar Aulalaki, now the number one in Al Qaeda worldwide.
[13:49.000 --> 13:55.000]  Number one on the rendition list, the killer capture list. Number one.
[13:55.000 --> 14:03.000]  For two years, he planned the attack with Anwar Aulalaki, and it turned out the Pentagon was tracking it with the CIA the entire time that's admitted.
[14:03.000 --> 14:10.000]  But Congress has been barred. Our elected representatives, the real government, from being able to see all those emails and hear those phone calls.
[14:10.000 --> 14:20.000]  Here's Fox News two weeks ago. Exclusive Al Qaeda leader dined at the Pentagon just months after 9-11 when he was the number three in Al Qaeda.
[14:20.000 --> 14:28.000]  On the news is the number three in Al Qaeda. Two months later, he's hanging out secretly at the Pentagon. That's Fox News. That's confirmed.
[14:28.000 --> 14:32.000]  The Pentagon says they're going to prosecute whoever leaked this to Fox News.
[14:32.000 --> 14:38.000]  The Pentagon doesn't deny the Army manual on how to blow up schools and blame it on foreign enemies.
[14:38.000 --> 14:41.000]  Okay? You're like, well, I support the military. You don't knock them.
[14:41.000 --> 14:50.000]  Well, then you should get control of your government, American people, and make sure the military is trained to be evil.
[14:50.000 --> 14:57.000]  And the Pentagon doesn't deny this stuff about Anwar Aulalaki. They responded and said, well, we're not going to really talk about it, but we're concerned.
[14:57.000 --> 15:01.000]  And we're also going to find out who released this and prosecute them.
[15:01.000 --> 15:10.000]  The number one leader of Al Qaeda works for the stinking bankers that run our Pentagon.
[15:10.000 --> 15:14.000]  Who grows the opium, the Pentagon?
[15:14.000 --> 15:17.000]  I've got the congressional hearings. You can just search.
[15:17.000 --> 15:26.000]  Congressional hearing, trillions missing from Pentagon. You'll get AP, Oregonian, video clips on YouTube.
[15:26.000 --> 15:33.000]  Write down everything I say. It's all documented. But why am I going to document everything I say today?
[15:33.000 --> 15:42.000]  Because our video, TSA Fondles Woman and Children for Refusing Airport Naked Body Scanners, it got linked on Drudge Friday.
[15:42.000 --> 15:50.000]  It's still up there today, hundreds of thousands of views, and there are idiots in there saying, I'm lying about all this.
[15:50.000 --> 15:57.000]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[15:57.000 --> 16:02.000]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[16:02.000 --> 16:11.000]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[16:11.000 --> 16:19.000]  They soak right in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit.
[16:19.000 --> 16:24.000]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[16:24.000 --> 16:29.000]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[16:29.000 --> 16:36.000]  We turn jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans, made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[16:36.000 --> 16:42.000]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[16:42.000 --> 16:49.000]  Order yours at gusset.com. Diamond gusset jeans got it, others don't.
[17:13.000 --> 17:19.000]  The power grid is dangerously overloaded, and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[17:19.000 --> 17:26.000]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[17:26.000 --> 17:31.000]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[17:31.000 --> 17:36.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors.
[17:36.000 --> 17:42.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.
[17:42.000 --> 17:50.000]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[17:50.000 --> 17:55.000]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones. You've heard me talk about Calvin 5-star soaps for years.
[17:55.000 --> 18:00.000]  This is an American-made product of the highest quality and compares to nothing you will find in stores.

[18:51.000 --> 18:55.000]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[18:55.000 --> 18:58.000]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[18:58.000 --> 19:03.000]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[19:03.000 --> 19:09.000]  We have tremendous influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[19:09.000 --> 19:14.000]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[19:14.000 --> 19:24.000]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing world government.
[19:24.000 --> 19:31.000]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and Arsonists, they're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[19:31.000 --> 19:38.000]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[19:38.000 --> 19:43.000]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[19:43.000 --> 19:59.000]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[20:13.000 --> 20:21.000]  You know, I'm already demonized by Nightline, MSNBC, CNN, Southern Property Law Center.
[20:21.000 --> 20:33.000]  Hundreds of major publications are just reporting the facts and putting the pieces of the puzzle together here, right in front of everyone, connecting the dots.
[20:33.000 --> 20:40.000]  And make no mistake, I'm risking my life bringing you this information, but liberty and freedom and the truth is worth it.
[20:40.000 --> 20:46.000]  If you give into these lies and you give into this brazen corruption, we're going to be looted.
[20:46.000 --> 20:49.000]  We're going to be imploded into a third world country.
[20:49.000 --> 20:55.000]  This nation has never been perfect, but it's been the best country on the face of the Earth and human history for liberty.
[20:55.000 --> 20:57.000]  And that's been the engine.
[20:57.000 --> 21:01.000]  Why, 4% of the world population had more than half the wealth.
[21:01.000 --> 21:06.000]  We don't anymore, because when you lose liberty, you lose the engine of productivity and wealth.
[21:06.000 --> 21:15.000]  Now, I'm going to try to be calm, okay? I'm going to try to be calm here and go slow, because it seems like when I'm calm and go slow, I can cover more.
[21:15.000 --> 21:19.000]  And I'm going to go over all of these articles, but why am I angry?
[21:19.000 --> 21:30.000]  There are three or four different types of people this weekend commenting on the YouTube video, and I use it as a type of focus group to see what the public's saying and doing.
[21:30.000 --> 21:40.000]  I'd say 75% of the people watching our video that's up on the Drudge Report, it's on Info Wars, it's on Prison Planet, it's been linked by a bunch of other newspapers.
[21:40.000 --> 21:46.000]  TSA fondles women and children refusing airport naked body scanners.
[21:46.000 --> 21:54.000]  More than seven out of 10 comments say, I'm not going to fly anymore. This is a police state. This doesn't keep us safe.
[21:54.000 --> 22:00.000]  This happened to me and my wife. This happened to my children.
[22:00.000 --> 22:13.000]  But of the other 25, 30% or so, you've got people saying that I'm a complete liar and that enhanced pat downs aren't being started where they grab your genitals with the insides of their hands and women's breast,
[22:13.000 --> 22:21.000]  even though it's been on the news for a year and now they're saying they're going to do it to everyone. They're phasing it in on top of the naked body scanners.
[22:21.000 --> 22:34.000]  So out of that 25, 30%, you've got people who run the gamut of denying and saying none of it exists or saying, yes, I'm a TSA agent being paid minimum wage who's not law enforcement.
[22:34.000 --> 22:41.000]  And this is great. Al Qaeda will blow up planes if you don't let us do this.
[22:41.000 --> 22:52.000]  So you got people just denying it saying I'm a liar, even though during the 11 minute video that's up on Drudge excise from my show Thursday.
[22:52.000 --> 22:56.000]  Everything we talk about, we show news articles and video clips.
[22:56.000 --> 23:06.000]  And I interview my employee Michelle, who just flew back from Colorado and her and her 20 month old baby girl and her eight year old girl.
[23:06.000 --> 23:12.000]  Little girls, I know the eight year old for years has played with my daughters.
[23:12.000 --> 23:16.000]  I've got three children, eight, six and two and a half.
[23:16.000 --> 23:22.000]  And people were also in the video saying it's a lie that there was a fake video.
[23:22.000 --> 23:28.000]  I mean, this is the level of denial, but the good news is over 70%.
[23:28.000 --> 23:31.000]  You can go read the comments for yourself, understand what's happening.
[23:31.000 --> 23:36.000]  And it's been seen by hundreds of thousands of people will be seen by millions, no doubt in the next few days.
[23:36.000 --> 23:42.000]  The one YouTube channel that it's posted on the Alex Jones channel on YouTube has 71 million views.
[23:42.000 --> 23:51.000]  We have over 200 million in the last two years alone, all combined with our other channel showing the effect this broadcast is having just on one medium YouTube.
[23:51.000 --> 23:55.000]  Two million listeners a day weekdays, a million and a half Sundays.
[23:55.000 --> 24:01.000]  XM global shortwave, number one radio show on the internet.
[24:01.000 --> 24:04.000]  So the good news is the words getting out.
[24:04.000 --> 24:12.000]  Now for all of the deniers, I'm going to cover basically many of the angles that we're dealing with here.
[24:12.000 --> 24:16.000]  Then I'm going to open the phones up and normally it's wide open phones.
[24:16.000 --> 24:20.000]  We don't screen calls unless every once in a while I say I want police to call in.
[24:20.000 --> 24:23.000]  I want people from Kentucky to call in people from Louisiana.
[24:23.000 --> 24:27.000]  If something's happening regionally, only call in.
[24:27.000 --> 24:29.000]  You can start calling now.
[24:29.000 --> 24:36.000]  If you were fondled by TSA, did they put their hands between your legs?
[24:36.000 --> 24:39.000]  Do they do the circular motion squeezing your breast?
[24:39.000 --> 24:46.000]  And by the way, I mean on the video we show clips of mainstream news showing with a mannequin how they do it, grabbing women's breast.
[24:46.000 --> 24:52.000]  So there's all that denial, but I want people to specifically hear from you.
[24:52.000 --> 25:01.000]  888-201-2244-888-201-2244-888-201-2244.
[25:01.000 --> 25:08.000]  Now, let me calmly just go through this stack of mainstream news articles, okay?
[25:08.000 --> 25:11.000]  With the document cam on them.
[25:11.000 --> 25:16.000]  TSA fondles women and children of using airport naked body scanners.
[25:16.000 --> 25:21.000]  That's the article we have on Info Wars with the video testimony on it if you want to watch that.
[25:21.000 --> 25:23.000]  Next, Seattle Times.
[25:23.000 --> 25:26.000]  New airport pat-downs are more intrusive.
[25:26.000 --> 25:35.000]  New more aggressive pat-down procedures put in place at U.S. airports by the Transportation Security Administration are raising privacy concerns.
[25:35.000 --> 25:43.000]  And it goes on to say areas previously off limits, like the groin, genitals, breast, it's all right there.
[25:43.000 --> 25:50.000]  In fact, I didn't see it in my stack, the one I covered Friday, but we can be the ABC Newsroom where it says, genitals, thank you.
[25:50.000 --> 25:53.000]  Here is USA Today.
[25:53.000 --> 25:56.000]  Airport screeners get more aggressive with pat-downs.
[25:56.000 --> 25:59.000]  I saw these commenters saying, I've been flying a lot.
[25:59.000 --> 26:02.000]  They only rub between my legs with the back of their hands.
[26:02.000 --> 26:04.000]  Alex says they grab palms up and squeeze.
[26:04.000 --> 26:06.000]  That's a lie.
[26:06.000 --> 26:07.000]  This is new.
[26:07.000 --> 26:09.000]  Did you hear me say new?
[26:09.000 --> 26:10.000]  Did you hear it?
[26:10.000 --> 26:13.000]  There weren't naked body scanners in two years ago.
[26:13.000 --> 26:14.000]  They're now in there.
[26:14.000 --> 26:18.000]  Two years ago, people said I was lying about that when they ordered the stinking things.
[26:18.000 --> 26:20.000]  Stop living in denial.
[26:20.000 --> 26:23.000]  I'm sorry, I'm not going to get, I'm trying to be calm here.
[26:23.000 --> 26:29.000]  I'm just, I just, you can't, this is a nation of people who want to be sheep.
[26:29.000 --> 26:31.000]  Here's Los Angeles Times.
[26:31.000 --> 26:34.000]  New TSA pat-down procedure expands nationwide.
[26:34.000 --> 26:40.000]  It goes on to say that they squeeze your groin and your breast.
[26:40.000 --> 26:41.000]  Here's another one.
[26:41.000 --> 26:42.000]  CNN.
[26:42.000 --> 26:47.000]  TSA to phase in new pat-down procedures at airports nationwide.
[26:47.000 --> 26:53.000]  And it detect hidden areas such as the breast and everywhere else.
[26:53.000 --> 26:54.000]  Okay.
[26:54.000 --> 26:56.000]  Then I get these denials that it could cause cancer.
[26:56.000 --> 26:57.000]  I saw those comments.
[26:57.000 --> 26:59.000]  This is the mail, the daily mail.
[26:59.000 --> 27:03.000]  Airport body scanners could give you cancer warrants experts.
[27:03.000 --> 27:10.000]  And then I have the government's own report here that's coming up in my stack where they say this.
[27:10.000 --> 27:11.000]  And there's the ABC News.
[27:11.000 --> 27:16.000]  Flyers in the American Civil Liberties Union are expressing concern about the pat-down because
[27:16.000 --> 27:19.000]  screeners are touching passengers' breast and genitals.
[27:19.000 --> 27:21.000]  That's USA Today.
[27:21.000 --> 27:22.000]  Okay.
[27:22.000 --> 27:24.000]  I've got the ABC News coming up.
[27:24.000 --> 27:25.000]  I mean, just stop.
[27:25.000 --> 27:29.000]  Literally, I showed these news articles during the video clip.
[27:29.000 --> 27:36.000]  And people were saying that it didn't say that in the articles because I had an ABC here and a New York Times here.
[27:36.000 --> 27:40.000]  And so they went and pulled up the New York Times that didn't say that and said that I was lying.
[27:40.000 --> 27:42.000]  But the ABC was laying right there.
[27:42.000 --> 27:43.000]  Here it is.
[27:43.000 --> 27:44.000]  Bloomberg.
[27:44.000 --> 27:45.000]  Bloomberg.
[27:45.000 --> 27:46.000]  I'm not making this up.
[27:46.000 --> 27:47.000]  Stop denying it.
[27:47.000 --> 27:48.000]  Face it.
[27:48.000 --> 27:55.000]  Airport body scanning raises radiation exposure.
[27:55.000 --> 27:56.000]  Committee says the U.S.
[27:56.000 --> 28:01.000]  government's interagency committee on radiation safety.
[28:01.000 --> 28:04.000]  And they're even more concerned about the workers who are around it all day.
[28:04.000 --> 28:05.000]  Okay.
[28:05.000 --> 28:06.000]  That's Bloomberg.
[28:06.000 --> 28:13.000]  Now, I also in the video talked about how the feds now want to put chest X-rays in, which are admittedly high radiation,
[28:13.000 --> 28:17.000]  claiming Alciiata, when they're not dining at the Pentagon,
[28:17.000 --> 28:20.000]  are going to sow bombs into women's breast.
[28:20.000 --> 28:22.000]  Well, how is somebody squeezing going to know?
[28:22.000 --> 28:28.000]  The point is, though, the point here is, people then said I was lying about that.
[28:28.000 --> 28:29.000]  Fox News.
[28:29.000 --> 28:32.000]  Terrorists could use explosives and breast implants to crash planes.
[28:32.000 --> 28:33.000]  Experts warn.
[28:33.000 --> 28:34.000]  There's another one.
[28:34.000 --> 28:35.000]  New York Post.
[28:35.000 --> 28:37.000]  Al-Qaeda surgical strike.
[28:37.000 --> 28:39.000]  Rest and butt bombs.
[28:39.000 --> 28:40.000]  And what do they call for?
[28:40.000 --> 28:41.000]  Chest X-rays.
[28:41.000 --> 28:43.000]  I'm coming back with more of it.
[28:43.000 --> 28:45.000]  We're going through every facet up within your phone calls.
[28:45.000 --> 28:46.000]  Stay with it.
[28:46.000 --> 28:47.000]  The denial's over.
[28:50.000 --> 28:54.000]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[28:54.000 --> 28:56.000]  It ended on June of 2009.
[28:56.000 --> 29:00.000]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[29:00.000 --> 29:03.000]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees,
[29:03.000 --> 29:06.000]  but for the rest of us, things seemed to be getting worse.
[29:06.000 --> 29:08.000]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[29:08.000 --> 29:11.000]  They've begun their long expected journey to the moon.
[29:11.000 --> 29:14.000]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver,
[29:14.000 --> 29:17.000]  you should consider a food savings account from eFoodsDirect.
[29:17.000 --> 29:19.000]  They both make fabulous investments.
[29:19.000 --> 29:21.000]  Food is our greatest dependency,
[29:21.000 --> 29:25.000]  and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[29:25.000 --> 29:27.000]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis,
[29:27.000 --> 29:30.000]  and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[29:30.000 --> 29:35.000]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.
[29:35.000 --> 29:38.000]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[29:38.000 --> 29:44.000]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com on the internet, or call 800-409-5633.
[29:44.000 --> 30:06.000]  That's eFoodsDirect.com, or 800-409-5633.
[30:14.000 --> 30:17.000]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program
[30:17.000 --> 30:20.000]  has established an old, powerful shadow state.
[30:20.000 --> 30:24.000]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[30:24.000 --> 30:28.000]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[30:28.000 --> 30:31.000]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies,
[30:31.000 --> 30:34.000]  staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[30:34.000 --> 30:38.000]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[30:38.000 --> 30:41.000]  The police state isn't coming. It's here.

[31:21.000 --> 31:50.000]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[31:50.000 --> 31:55.000]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system
[31:55.000 --> 31:58.000]  with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions,
[31:58.000 --> 32:01.000]  yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System
[32:01.000 --> 32:06.000]  and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[32:06.000 --> 32:11.000]  My name is Mario Safaldi, and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[32:11.000 --> 32:15.000]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions,
[32:15.000 --> 32:19.000]  it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed
[32:19.000 --> 32:23.000]  to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[32:23.000 --> 32:31.000]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[32:31.000 --> 32:35.000]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System
[32:35.000 --> 32:41.000]  at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[32:41.000 --> 32:49.000]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have. That's www.silverlungs.com.
[33:11.000 --> 33:33.000]  We're supposedly the land of the free, home of the brave.
[33:33.000 --> 33:37.000]  We're told we're being naked body scanned and buried with radiation
[33:37.000 --> 33:45.000]  having our 20-month-old children fondled by men, little girls, to stop al-Qaeda.
[33:45.000 --> 33:52.000]  And al-Qaeda is a creation of the Pentagon on record.
[33:52.000 --> 33:56.000]  And that's all coming up. I'm going to go over how this is a fraud, the basis,
[33:56.000 --> 34:01.000]  the excuse for all of this coming up, but continuing here.
[34:01.000 --> 34:07.000]  First nine years ago, they start making you take your shoes off, then you're belt.
[34:07.000 --> 34:10.000]  What happens when somebody puts a bomb in their hind end?
[34:10.000 --> 34:13.000]  We're all going to have to have a proctology exam?
[34:13.000 --> 34:19.000]  I actually saw commenters on the video about one of my employees being molested by TSA,
[34:19.000 --> 34:22.000]  having her genitals and breasts grabbed, hard.
[34:22.000 --> 34:25.000]  That's in all these news articles that they squeeze hard.
[34:25.000 --> 34:30.000]  And people said, yeah, we may have to start doing proctology exams.
[34:30.000 --> 34:36.000]  It's ridiculous. And coming up, I want to explain to you that the airport workers aren't screened,
[34:36.000 --> 34:40.000]  that the general aviation, they just drive around on the airport everywhere.
[34:40.000 --> 34:44.000]  This is all made up. And you think you're not going to fly to escape this?
[34:44.000 --> 34:48.000]  The federal government's admitted plan is to have mobile vans everywhere
[34:48.000 --> 34:54.000]  and in every courthouse, county, state, federal, and it's already happening.
[34:54.000 --> 34:59.000]  If the government wants to train you to put their hands on you and get in your comfort zone,
[34:59.000 --> 35:04.000]  they want to train a cadre of federal quasi-cop minions to go out and do it.
[35:04.000 --> 35:12.000]  The good news is, Friday night I was driving home, put 590 AM, KLBJ on,
[35:12.000 --> 35:18.000]  only heard the tail end of it, of Texas legislature and state police being quoted in the committee
[35:18.000 --> 35:22.000]  saying these aren't even law enforcement officers, there's no probable cause,
[35:22.000 --> 35:27.000]  they're touching genitals, and that's wrong, and we're going to try to pass a law to stop it.
[35:27.000 --> 35:32.000]  And I missed the first part of the report. In fact, I forgot to have you search that term.
[35:32.000 --> 35:35.000]  Texas legislature looks at full body scanning.
[35:35.000 --> 35:39.000]  I know the federal government is as well, but search that because I actually want to have an article on that.
[35:39.000 --> 35:41.000]  That was something I forgot to do.
[35:41.000 --> 35:44.000]  So the good news is, I'm not the only one angry about this.
[35:44.000 --> 35:50.000]  I mean, I turn on the AM radio, and you can hear it on FM locally too, in 1997,
[35:50.000 --> 35:56.000]  and boom, boom, they're talking about it.
[35:56.000 --> 35:59.000]  And my wife is so freaked out, we can't travel.
[35:59.000 --> 36:04.000]  I will not subject my 8-year-old son, my 6-year-old and 2.5-year-old daughter to this.
[36:04.000 --> 36:09.000]  I will not fly. I have to put up with it.
[36:09.000 --> 36:12.000]  And let me tell you something, they haven't put me through naked body scanners yet.
[36:12.000 --> 36:16.000]  I was there last Tuesday in San Jose flying out of California,
[36:16.000 --> 36:22.000]  and I sat there for 20 minutes after I went to the checkpoint with Aaron Dykes watching nothing.
[36:22.000 --> 36:27.000]  Only women and children, that's why I meant to watch just a few minutes,
[36:27.000 --> 36:31.000]  but I kept waiting at four checkpoints, at four lines going, there's got to be a man.
[36:31.000 --> 36:34.000]  There's got to be somebody other than a woman or children,
[36:34.000 --> 36:37.000]  because they're training the TSA to accept it right now.
[36:37.000 --> 36:39.000]  They've had a revolt within TSA.
[36:39.000 --> 36:41.000]  They've had to fire a bunch of people that don't want to do this.
[36:41.000 --> 36:44.000]  And there were men touching children.
[36:44.000 --> 36:49.000]  There were little girls, and I'm not saying it's okay for a woman to do it either.
[36:49.000 --> 36:52.000]  It's just these taboos.
[36:52.000 --> 36:58.000]  And then there's the taboo, not even taboo, but federal radiology laws,
[36:58.000 --> 37:01.000]  that they're just exempt from.
[37:01.000 --> 37:05.000]  There's no law, they just do it, color of law, setting the precedent
[37:05.000 --> 37:09.000]  that there's no radiation badges, no one who works there is warned.
[37:09.000 --> 37:12.000]  They call the TSA in, we discovered a month ago, Nationwide,
[37:12.000 --> 37:14.000]  and say, are you concerned about the scanners?
[37:14.000 --> 37:17.000]  If you say you are, they fire you.
[37:17.000 --> 37:22.000]  So they're just finding a group of idiots that will go along with this.
[37:22.000 --> 37:27.000]  Continuing, what's behind the naked body scanners?
[37:27.000 --> 37:34.000]  TSA programmed to spot terrorists a $200 million sham, CBS News,
[37:34.000 --> 37:43.000]  and it goes on to say the TSA has not stopped one terrorist in nine years.
[37:43.000 --> 37:47.000]  Here's the Boston Globe, Boston.com.
[37:47.000 --> 37:50.000]  In fact, I need document cams on all of this, they'll say it's not real.
[37:50.000 --> 37:54.000]  Group slams churned off on scanner promotion,
[37:54.000 --> 37:59.000]  and it turns out the company he lobbies for is making billions and billions a year.
[37:59.000 --> 38:02.000]  He's making millions on all of this.
[38:02.000 --> 38:07.000]  Former head of Homeland Security, before he left, he ordered thousands of the machines.
[38:07.000 --> 38:09.000]  The week before they were scheduled to be put in,
[38:09.000 --> 38:13.000]  the underwear bomber attacks out of Europe, out of Amsterdam,
[38:13.000 --> 38:17.000]  and then it came out that Anwar Aulaki, the admitted CIA agent,
[38:17.000 --> 38:20.000]  was the one handling the guy, and the CIA ordered the State Department
[38:20.000 --> 38:23.000]  to help get the drugged out youth on the plane.
[38:23.000 --> 38:25.000]  We knew about it two months before it was mainstream news,
[38:25.000 --> 38:30.000]  because we had listeners, including a lawyer, who was on board and witnessed it all happen,
[38:30.000 --> 38:32.000]  and saw the government help get him on the plane,
[38:32.000 --> 38:35.000]  looked like he was drugged out of his mind.
[38:35.000 --> 38:39.000]  Anwar Aulaki runs the Fort Hood shooter.
[38:39.000 --> 38:42.000]  He runs the Times Square attack.
[38:42.000 --> 38:44.000]  He runs the underwear attacker.
[38:44.000 --> 38:52.000]  He runs them all, and he, Fox News, Fox News, don't deny it, search the term right now.
[38:52.000 --> 38:58.000]  Exclusive al-Qaeda leader dying at the Pentagon just months after 9-11.
[38:58.000 --> 39:00.000]  People claim they care so much about the military.
[39:00.000 --> 39:03.000]  Well, why don't you, members of the military or families,
[39:03.000 --> 39:05.000]  call for an investigation.
[39:05.000 --> 39:11.000]  Congress isn't even allowed to see all the emails of Anwar Aulaki in control,
[39:11.000 --> 39:20.000]  in control of all these patsies, all these mentally ill extremists.
[39:20.000 --> 39:22.000]  Now, continuing.
[39:22.000 --> 39:26.000]  Then I want to get into some other areas of this.
[39:26.000 --> 39:32.000]  Forbes, scanner vans allow drive-by snooping of your homes, your cars, everything.
[39:32.000 --> 39:35.000]  The federal government's ordered 500 of these,
[39:35.000 --> 39:39.000]  and there's no radiation shielding for the people driving around with these.
[39:39.000 --> 39:41.000]  $850,000 a piece.
[39:41.000 --> 39:45.000]  They're 10 times the power of a chest x-ray, looking right through your walls and your car.
[39:45.000 --> 39:47.000]  And I have video.
[39:47.000 --> 39:48.000]  That's why our articles are so important.
[39:48.000 --> 39:52.000]  We have a boil down on Prison Planet and Info Wars about mobile snooping vans,
[39:52.000 --> 39:59.000]  where it shows Fox News in New York saying the army helped arrest 2,000 people with drugs or alcohol,
[39:59.000 --> 40:05.000]  and it shows them driving families through scanners that are super high-power.
[40:05.000 --> 40:09.000]  I mean, they make an MRA or chest x-ray look tame,
[40:09.000 --> 40:15.000]  and the troops are standing right outside the scanners being fried as well.
[40:15.000 --> 40:20.000]  Just like 20 years ago, they wouldn't let the troops use DU to put a uranium,
[40:20.000 --> 40:21.000]  because they knew it would kill them down the road.
[40:21.000 --> 40:22.000]  Now, they just say it's fine.
[40:22.000 --> 40:23.000]  Men use it.
[40:23.000 --> 40:25.000]  It's no problem.
[40:25.000 --> 40:30.000]  So this is how serious all of this is starting to get.
[40:30.000 --> 40:33.000]  Now, I've covered some of the basic facts.
[40:33.000 --> 40:37.000]  So you can go read USA Today, ABC News.
[40:37.000 --> 40:43.000]  You can go read all of these mainstream news articles where they admit they grab your genitals,
[40:43.000 --> 40:46.000]  male or female, and they squeeze your breast.
[40:46.000 --> 40:47.000]  Okay?
[40:47.000 --> 40:51.000]  And in the video that's up on Drudge Report that we put together,
[40:51.000 --> 40:56.000]  it shows clips of mainstream news showing them grabbing breast and squeezing.
[40:56.000 --> 40:57.000]  Okay?
[40:57.000 --> 41:01.000]  So at least if you're going to be four being a total slave,
[41:01.000 --> 41:03.000]  and you love groveling at the feet of tyranny,
[41:03.000 --> 41:06.000]  and you get off and you have a fetish on being a slave,
[41:06.000 --> 41:09.000]  and you don't know it's all staged to train you to be a slave,
[41:09.000 --> 41:12.000]  at least don't deny they're doing this.
[41:12.000 --> 41:16.000]  Because some of the commenters admit it's happening but say it's good.
[41:16.000 --> 41:22.000]  But some of the other commenters, they are denying this is even being phased in.
[41:22.000 --> 41:26.000]  Of course, we open the phones up for people only who've been abused like this,
[41:26.000 --> 41:28.000]  had their genitals touched,
[41:28.000 --> 41:32.000]  and we've got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven plus calls
[41:32.000 --> 41:36.000]  just up on the board and more streaming in.
[41:36.000 --> 41:39.000]  Now, I'm going to keep going through this because I wrote some quick notes
[41:39.000 --> 41:43.000]  before I went live on other facets to this.
[41:43.000 --> 41:48.000]  Did you know that Paul Watson has flown to China several times
[41:48.000 --> 41:51.000]  because his fiance, they get married in a few weeks,
[41:51.000 --> 41:56.000]  is Chinese slash British, he's from Britain.
[41:56.000 --> 42:00.000]  And there's no airport security, you just go right through it.
[42:00.000 --> 42:02.000]  And they actually have some real terrorists,
[42:02.000 --> 42:04.000]  if you want to call them that, people that resist them,
[42:04.000 --> 42:06.000]  in Tibet and Mongolia.
[42:06.000 --> 42:09.000]  I mean, actual real people that go around attacking.
[42:09.000 --> 42:11.000]  No security.
[42:11.000 --> 42:14.000]  You're flying to Saudi Arabia, none of this security.
[42:14.000 --> 42:16.000]  Only land of the free home of the brave in Europe.
[42:16.000 --> 42:19.000]  And some people say, well, I'm going to run to Canada, I'm going to run to Europe.
[42:19.000 --> 42:21.000]  They're all putting in the same naked body scanners.
[42:21.000 --> 42:25.000]  In fact, last Christmas, with Mutalib, the underwear bomber,
[42:25.000 --> 42:27.000]  they had naked body scanners,
[42:27.000 --> 42:31.000]  and the State Department told the airport to let him pass security.
[42:31.000 --> 42:35.000]  This is associated press and get him on the plane
[42:35.000 --> 42:40.000]  because he was a special person for the government.
[42:40.000 --> 42:43.000]  Of course, we knew that two months before we had the eyewitnesses on.
[42:43.000 --> 42:45.000]  So we're going to go over the other facets of this.
[42:45.000 --> 42:47.000]  None of this is to protect you.
[42:47.000 --> 43:15.000]  It's to train you how to be a slave.
[43:15.000 --> 43:19.000]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[43:19.000 --> 43:22.000]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[43:22.000 --> 43:26.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[43:26.000 --> 43:31.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[43:31.000 --> 43:34.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[43:34.000 --> 43:36.000]  one of my old sponsors.
[43:36.000 --> 43:40.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[43:40.000 --> 43:42.000]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[43:42.000 --> 43:46.000]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com
[43:46.000 --> 43:50.000]  or call 1-877-327-0365.
[43:50.000 --> 43:54.000]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[43:54.000 --> 43:56.000]  It ended on June of 2009.
[43:56.000 --> 44:00.000]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[44:00.000 --> 44:03.000]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees,
[44:03.000 --> 44:06.000]  but for the rest of us, things seemed to be getting worse.
[44:06.000 --> 44:08.000]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[44:08.000 --> 44:11.000]  They've begun their long expected journey to the moon.
[44:11.000 --> 44:14.000]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver,
[44:14.000 --> 44:17.000]  you should consider a food savings account from eFoodsDirect.
[44:17.000 --> 44:19.000]  They both make fabulous investments.
[44:19.000 --> 44:24.000]  Food is our greatest dependency and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[44:24.000 --> 44:27.000]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis,
[44:27.000 --> 44:30.000]  and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[44:30.000 --> 44:35.000]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.
[44:35.000 --> 44:38.000]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.

[45:35.000 --> 45:40.000]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection,

[45:45.000 --> 46:07.000]  Diamond Gusset Jeans Got It, Others Don't.

[46:46.000 --> 46:51.000]  Check them out today.
[46:51.000 --> 46:55.000]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[46:55.000 --> 47:00.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[47:00.000 --> 47:12.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[47:12.000 --> 47:18.000]  Okay, Emmy and Georgia, David, Barbara, Jerry, John, Chase, we're going to get to all of you.
[47:18.000 --> 47:23.000]  We've got flight attendants calling in, TSA, you name it.
[47:23.000 --> 47:29.000]  I want to hear from TSA people, 888-201-2244, and I want to be clear about something.
[47:29.000 --> 47:35.000]  When I flew out of Austin, the ticket person wanted my autograph.
[47:35.000 --> 47:40.000]  When I flew out of San Jose, the ticket person came over, wanted my autograph.
[47:40.000 --> 47:48.000]  About half the time, when I fly around the country, the TSA people ask for my autograph.
[47:48.000 --> 47:51.000]  And they say, hey, we're going to get unionized soon.
[47:51.000 --> 47:54.000]  We know this is a bunch of bull, this is just a job.
[47:54.000 --> 47:59.000]  A lot of them aren't abusive, but a bunch of them are, and every day, literally,
[47:59.000 --> 48:04.000]  you hear about them being child molesters in their off time, planting cocaine in a woman's bag,
[48:04.000 --> 48:09.000]  demanding favors from them, going crazy, stripping down naked, saying they're God.
[48:09.000 --> 48:13.000]  That's NBC. Just search the term TSA agent says he's God.
[48:13.000 --> 48:18.000]  NBC, Los Angeles. It attracts control freaks.
[48:18.000 --> 48:25.000]  I mean, imagine if you're somebody that wants to grope women, you're going to go get a TSA job.
[48:25.000 --> 48:31.000]  And imagine if your wife or you or anybody else, your husband, was in a park or a mall
[48:31.000 --> 48:36.000]  and somebody ran up and grabbed your genitals, they'd spend probably 10 years in prison.
[48:36.000 --> 48:41.000]  But oh, these are, I saw one commenter, these are like professionals, like a doctor.
[48:41.000 --> 48:44.000]  You don't get mad when the doctor touches you, do you?
[48:44.000 --> 48:48.000]  See, this is the mental illness where people make excuses about this.
[48:48.000 --> 48:53.000]  So I want to cover a few more facets that we're going to nothing but your calls towards the end of the next hour.
[48:53.000 --> 48:57.000]  I've got incredible economic and stage terror news we haven't even gotten to yet.
[48:57.000 --> 49:05.000]  But this is the end of freedom.
[49:05.000 --> 49:09.000]  If we let this continue, if you are in denial and say you're just going to drive your car,
[49:09.000 --> 49:15.000]  they're announcing mobile X-ray vans nationwide. They're announcing checkpoints nationwide.
[49:15.000 --> 49:18.000]  They're announcing they want these in shopping malls. Search the term.
[49:18.000 --> 49:21.000]  FBI wants checkpoints in shopping malls.
[49:21.000 --> 49:29.000]  Homeland Security admitted in a C-SPAN program I saw seven years ago that they were going to make you have an ID card
[49:29.000 --> 49:34.000]  to go into any job that you would have cameras in your car surveilling you at all times.
[49:34.000 --> 49:39.000]  Now that's being announced in the news that naked body scanners would be everywhere.
[49:39.000 --> 49:45.000]  They tested them at four airports actually in 2002 that they're going to have passive MRIs that scan your brain waves
[49:45.000 --> 49:50.000]  and decide if you're a terrorist. Come on, folks. This is made up.
[49:50.000 --> 49:56.000]  If you really believe Muslim terrorists are trying to blow everything up, why aren't they just doing profiling?
[49:56.000 --> 50:02.000]  Oh, they've put now over 2 million Americans on these lists and try to say you can't own a gun.
[50:02.000 --> 50:05.000]  No judge, no jury. You're just now on a no fly, no buy list.
[50:05.000 --> 50:13.000]  They're already denying guns to people outside of law and trying to pass a federal law called the no fly, no buy.
[50:13.000 --> 50:19.000]  That's the bill this year where you just can't buy a gun.
[50:19.000 --> 50:24.000]  Two million plus Americans, they're adding 25,000 on average every month.
[50:24.000 --> 50:32.000]  What, three years ago the head of the Denver Sector Union for federal marshals went public and said,
[50:32.000 --> 50:39.000]  we're ordered to put people on lists for no reason as a quota?
[50:39.000 --> 50:44.000]  Land of the free, home of the brave, grabbing your wife's genitals, grabbing your wife's breasts,
[50:44.000 --> 50:50.000]  grabbing your small children, babies. They fondle babies and they go, oh Al Qaeda may have a baby bomb.
[50:50.000 --> 50:55.000]  Give me a break and wear all the lockies hanging out at the Pentagon, the head of Al Qaeda.
[50:55.000 --> 51:02.000]  He was the number three God of Bin Laden.
[51:02.000 --> 51:05.000]  But I want to point this out. Where does it end?
[51:05.000 --> 51:07.000]  Naked body scanners to walk out your front door in the morning?
[51:07.000 --> 51:12.000]  I mean terrorists could attack anywhere. Why are the terrorists always trying to attack airlines?
[51:12.000 --> 51:22.000]  The system is using the airlines as a place to create a cadre of federal agents to expand federal jurisdiction illegally out into the entire country.
[51:22.000 --> 51:30.000]  And now, as I told you seven years ago, as I saw Ridge say it, they have viper teams nationwide at bus stops, trains and on the streets.
[51:30.000 --> 51:35.000]  In Miami and Houston, they've just lined up people at checkpoints and put them through the scanners.
[51:35.000 --> 51:45.000]  Now Homeland Security's bought hundreds of these big 18-wheeler trailers where they have three lines going through them with naked body scanners to get into football games.
[51:45.000 --> 51:55.000]  America is being indoctrinated to live in Nazi Germany because the big central banks are bankrupting us and openly saying they're gearing up to take your private pension funds.
[51:55.000 --> 52:03.000]  That's now mainstream news and they're putting a police state in place and a huge army of people that think it's normal and they're training the general public to accept it.
[52:03.000 --> 52:07.000]  That's all that's going on here.
[52:07.000 --> 52:11.000]  So you've got the health effects for the TSA agents. You've got the health effects for the public.
[52:11.000 --> 52:21.000]  You've got the mobile vans that look for your walls that are even more powerful than chest x-rays 10 times without a radiologist on.
[52:21.000 --> 52:25.000]  And if you think you're going to escape this, it's going in everywhere.
[52:25.000 --> 52:33.000]  You imagine how much money shirt off with his company is going to make if they already made $4 billion this year, $2 billion the year before that.
[52:33.000 --> 52:39.000]  They're set to make $6 billion in 2011. Every airport, including small ones, are going to have these.
[52:39.000 --> 52:43.000]  Meanwhile, the elite all fly on private jets. They just drive right through.
[52:43.000 --> 52:49.000]  Meanwhile, it has nothing to do with keeping you safe.
[52:49.000 --> 52:55.000]  I said this years ago, real terrorists if they existed would just go into the ticket area and shoot people.
[52:55.000 --> 52:59.000]  Well, now they want to search you there and at the checkpoint.
[52:59.000 --> 53:07.000]  And when I flew last week or two weeks ago in Austin and when I was in California, they had secondary searches,
[53:07.000 --> 53:11.000]  feeling people up at the gate, randomly pulling people out of the line.
[53:11.000 --> 53:13.000]  Who watches the watchers?
[53:13.000 --> 53:22.000]  Half the time these TSA people can't speak English. What stops some terrorist if you believe in it and have a fetish for being afraid of Muslim terrorists?
[53:22.000 --> 53:26.000]  Why don't you actually find out who runs these terrorists?
[53:26.000 --> 53:32.000]  You think I'd be on hundreds of radio stations on all these years lying?
[53:32.000 --> 53:34.000]  You think I'd get away with that?
[53:34.000 --> 53:38.000]  I've already given you all the evidence and all the proof.
[53:38.000 --> 53:41.000]  Why don't you just go check it out for yourself?
[53:41.000 --> 53:54.000]  When I get up here and tell you and we're all a lockie, I told you this five years ago, is CIA operative behind finding these mentally ill Muslims to carry out badly coordinated attacks as a pretext to take our rights.
[53:54.000 --> 53:56.000]  If that wasn't true, I'd be crucified.
[53:56.000 --> 54:00.000]  But people send me emails saying I'm lying about AP and Fox News.
[54:00.000 --> 54:02.000]  I'm not lying about any of this.
[54:02.000 --> 54:05.000]  I'm telling the truth.
[54:05.000 --> 54:15.000]  And a lot of you out there that sit on the fence and quietly know this is true, media people, government people, corporate people who go along with this, you're being enslaved because of it.
[54:15.000 --> 54:24.000]  The good news is this New York Times reporter and others, when they said they wanted to opt out of the machines, they were screamed at.
[54:24.000 --> 54:26.000]  They were abused.
[54:26.000 --> 54:36.000]  The New York Times writer Joe Sharkey said that they were brutal, that they squeezed him hard, that it was rough, that it was to punish him.
[54:36.000 --> 54:38.000]  And the TSA admits that.
[54:38.000 --> 54:54.000]  And like dog training, TSA had told the Chicago Tribune four months ago that soon everyone will have to naked body scan and they're going to have the enhanced molestation pat downs, the grope downs,
[54:54.000 --> 54:58.000]  the the fondle downs after you go to the checkpoint.
[54:58.000 --> 55:05.000]  And I was witnessing that they send them through scanners and then squeeze them babies and baby carriages.
[55:05.000 --> 55:07.000]  I watched it.
[55:07.000 --> 55:12.000]  Not this Tuesday, but last Tuesday, a week and a half ago in San Jose.
[55:12.000 --> 55:19.000]  And then my employee, my customers, one of my customer service people, she said, oh yeah, I flew back a week ago and that happened at Denver.
[55:19.000 --> 55:21.000]  So I got her on air.
[55:21.000 --> 55:31.000]  So the drudge report posted it and people sit there and the good news is 70 plus percent are, you know, other comments are for us and aren't in denial.
[55:31.000 --> 55:33.000]  But the rest are in denial.
[55:33.000 --> 55:35.000]  That's another good piece of news.
[55:35.000 --> 55:41.000]  They had a British Airways came out two weeks ago and said this is all a big joke and destroying the airlines.
[55:41.000 --> 55:42.000]  And that's what the government wants.
[55:42.000 --> 55:44.000]  They want to nationalize the airlines.
[55:44.000 --> 55:45.000]  They know it's bankrupting them.
[55:45.000 --> 55:46.000]  They know a lot.
[55:46.000 --> 55:48.000]  Millions of people aren't flying because of this.
[55:48.000 --> 55:53.000]  They've had, again, federal agencies come out and say the radiation is dangerous.
[55:53.000 --> 55:56.000]  I mean, I read you that quote earlier.
[55:56.000 --> 55:58.000]  I'm not even going to just say it again.
[55:58.000 --> 55:59.000]  You'll say it's not true.
[55:59.000 --> 56:01.000]  I'll just pull it out right now.
[56:01.000 --> 56:03.000]  See how you like that.
[56:03.000 --> 56:10.000]  I'll get the mainstream news article right here from Bloomberg and I'll read it on air to you if you're living in denial out there because I'm done with it.
[56:10.000 --> 56:11.000]  I'm tired of it.
[56:11.000 --> 56:12.000]  I'm not putting up with it.
[56:12.000 --> 56:22.000]  Airport body scanning raises radiation exposure committee says interagency committee on radiation safety report and the International Atomic Energy Agency and the World Health Organization.
[56:22.000 --> 56:27.000]  So the U.S. government and the International Atomic Energy Agency and the U.N.
[56:27.000 --> 56:29.000]  Okay.
[56:29.000 --> 56:33.000]  So don't sit there and tell me, oh, it's like the radiation you get from a cell phone.
[56:33.000 --> 56:37.000]  Bologna.
[56:37.000 --> 56:41.000]  They may tell those stupid TSA agents that are going to be dying of cancer.
[56:41.000 --> 56:48.000]  They may tell the guys driving the 500 mobile trucks around to look right through your walls 10 times more powerful than a chest X-ray.
[56:48.000 --> 56:50.000]  It's okay, but it isn't.
[56:50.000 --> 56:52.000]  It's not okay.
[56:52.000 --> 56:53.000]  It's not okay.
[56:53.000 --> 56:59.000]  Now, I promise I'm getting your phone calls, but none of this has anything to do with terrorism.
[56:59.000 --> 57:00.000]  Get that through your heads.
[57:00.000 --> 57:02.000]  This is your baptism of slavery.
[57:02.000 --> 57:04.000]  This is your indoctrination.
[57:04.000 --> 57:05.000]  This is your conditioning.
[57:05.000 --> 57:10.000]  Hey, hey, the government I told you 15 years ago takes all babies' blood at birth for 39 years in the U.S.
[57:10.000 --> 57:14.000]  Now that's mainstream news, and it goes to the Pentagon.
[57:14.000 --> 57:21.000]  The government shoots up little kids worldwide with live syphilis, with live polio.
[57:21.000 --> 57:23.000]  They nerve gas our own troops in Project Shad.
[57:23.000 --> 57:25.000]  It's eugenics.
[57:25.000 --> 57:26.000]  They're conditioning you.
[57:26.000 --> 57:28.000]  They want population reduction.
[57:28.000 --> 57:30.000]  They're training you to be fried by radiation.
[57:30.000 --> 57:33.000]  They're using DU on our own troops.
[57:33.000 --> 57:34.000]  Project Shad.
[57:34.000 --> 57:36.000]  Wake up, evil people, run things.
[57:36.000 --> 57:38.000]  Stop being so naive.

[59:35.000 --> 01:00:01.000]  Thank you.
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:27.000]  Thank you.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:42.000]  Thank you.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.000]  Hey, Alex.
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000]  How are you?
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.000]  I'm fired up, sir.
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.000]  What's on your mind?
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.000]  Nothing.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.000]  I had a friend from Houston, Texas.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:54.000]  She was traveling to New York where I'm from.
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:01:01.000]  And she had to go into the human body scanner because they found something suspicious in her carry-on.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:05.000]  It was a harmless object from a gift shop.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.000]  Oh, yeah.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.000]  Now, I've had a mask.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000]  What's this camera?
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.000]  We've got to search you now.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000]  A camera is very scary.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000]  Or we have this little thing of shampoo.
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.000]  And I go, it says three ounces.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000]  And they're like, get over here.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.000]  Any excuse?
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.000]  Yeah.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:23.000]  Because they've got to play up this delusion that the terror is real.
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.000]  This mental illness of paranoia.
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000]  Keep the fear alive.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.000]  Keep the fear alive.
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.000]  Yeah.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.000]  Exactly.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:34.000]  And yeah, as you know, it was just, she's just keep in mind, you know, this is your average
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.000]  looking American girl, you know, wouldn't hurt a fly.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.000]  I know her.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.000]  And she's just, you know, she poses no threat.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:48.000]  Anyways, the most ridiculous thing I found from her experience is what the TSA officer
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000]  said to her once she was done with the search.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000]  Do you have any idea what it could be?
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.000]  He said, Hey, can I have your phone number?
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.000]  Oh, very close.
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:00.000]  The new fat, which is a find me on Facebook.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000]  He had the nerve.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000]  Find me on Facebook.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.000]  This guy.
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.000]  Um, yeah.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000]  And yeah, that was, that's pretty much it.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:17.000]  Listen, all I saw being surged in San Jose was women and children.
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:20.000]  And it's come out in the news over and over again.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000]  I will tell him, Hey, I found cocaine.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000]  You better give me your number.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000]  Yeah, that's bad.
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.000]  Really quick, Alex.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.000]  Really quick.
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.000]  Um, just to show you how far you're word spreading.
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:37.000]  I had a friend tell me about you from, uh, from California when I was studying out there.
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000]  He's from Toronto, Canada.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.000]  I'm, I'm from New York.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000]  I was born and raised here.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:47.000]  And, you know, when I first heard you, I thought you were some crazy right wing, uh, radical,
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000]  you know, I was brainwashing.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000]  I started looking up what you had to say.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:56.000]  And it's sad, unfortunately, but, you know, everything's true.
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.000]  What you're, what you're saying.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:03.000]  I just, uh, I thank you for opening up my eyes and, uh, I say, keep up the good work.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000]  You're doing your job as a journalist.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000]  Well, look, I'm just a citizen.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:12.000]  I do engage in journalistic analysis, but I'm just an average person who's angry about
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000]  tyranny and I'm not going along with it.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.000]  David, I appreciate your call.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.000]  Barbara in Alabama, you're on the air.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000]  Hi, Alex.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000]  Hey, Barbara.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000]  This is Barbara in Alabama.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:29.000]  Now I want you to know first off, I am pushing 70 years old.
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.000]  Okay.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:38.000]  I am not a young woman, but me and my friend was going to fly out of the Memphis, Tennessee
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:44.000]  airport and I told them I wasn't going to go through that body scanner.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.000]  So they said I had to be searched.
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:54.000]  So they pulled me over and there was not a part of my body and this is out in public.
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:58.000]  This is, I mean, they don't take you in no private room.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:02.000]  You just right out there in public and they, they ain't a part of your body.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.000]  They do not touch.
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.000]  Where did they touch you?
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000]  Do they touch your legs?
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:10.000]  Yeah, between my legs and across my breast.
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:15.000]  And I mean, there wasn't a part of my body they didn't touch, but the worst part was
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:20.000]  my friend, she, she saw what they was doing.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.000]  Barbara, hold on.
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.000]  Barbara, some stations don't carry this five minute segment.
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000]  I wish they would.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000]  I want you to recap and start your story over.
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:32.000]  Then we're going to Emily in Georgia, but there's been many mainstream news articles
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:36.000]  written about the better looking a woman, the more they go after them.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:40.000]  And you heard about the guy saying, Hey baby, you know, check me out on Facebook.
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.000]  I mean, you got a wife that's hotter than the pistol.
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.000]  Look out.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.000]  There's a pervert making $10 an hour and he's going to, he's going to grab them.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:53.000]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000]  It ended on June of 2009.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:59.000]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:03.000]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000]  of us, things seemed to be getting worse.
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:10.000]  They've begun their long expected journey to the moon.
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:14.000]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000]  a food savings account from eFoodsDirect.
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000]  They both make fabulous investments.
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:23.000]  Food is our greatest dependency and we know it will be more precious than any financial
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.000]  resource.
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:29.000]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis and you can't eat paper, stocks or metals.
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:34.000]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy fixed meals to enjoy now or save for
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.000]  long term.
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:38.000]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:44.000]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:06:13.000]  That's eFoodsDirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:43.000]  That's eFoodsDirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:07:12.000]  That's eFoodsDirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:17.000]  That's eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:08:02.000]  That's eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:14.000]  Now Barbara, you were talking about how you were humiliated in public and you did say they grabbed your genitals, walk through what happened, but as we went to break you said the worst part was what they did to your friend.
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000]  But start at the beginning, briefly go over it.
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.000]  What happened?
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.000]  You were flying out of Tennessee.
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000]  Memphis, you said, go ahead.
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:32.000]  Yes, so we were going out of the Memphis, Tennessee airport and of course, you know, I've been listening to you for years, so of course I opted out and I told my friend to opt out.
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:42.000]  But when I opted out, they called me just right to the side, right there in front of everybody and do this, what they said it was a pat down.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:49.000]  But it wasn't no pat down, they feel your whole body and that wasn't a part of my body that they did not touch.
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:53.000]  Specifically, how hard did they grab your genitals?
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:59.000]  Now, I'm going to say the lady who did this was quite polite and she was apologetic.
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:10.000]  But while they were doing that to me right there in public, they found my friend's CPAC machine.
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:13.000]  Now, she is over 70 years old.
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000]  What's a CPAC machine?
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:18.000]  It's a breathing machine.
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:22.000]  Oh, oh yeah, any type of camera equipment.
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.000]  That's what I've seen.
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:29.000]  I've told the story of World War II vets I saw going to a Pearl Harbor, I remember it's about six years ago in San Francisco.
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:33.000]  They were screaming at these guys, getting them out of wheelchairs with their oxygen tanks.
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000]  But I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:38.000]  Yeah, see, my friend did real bad shit and she can't travel no more.
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:44.000]  That's why I was flying with her and they took her machine apart.
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:47.000]  Now, this has got a face mask and everything on it.
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000]  You can tell it's for her to be able to breathe.
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:53.000]  And again, it's this fetish about terrorists and we don't profile anybody.
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:54.000]  So everybody's a slave.
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000]  How did it end, Barbara?
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:00.000]  Okay, well, she got upset when she saw what they was doing to me.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.000]  So she said she'd go through the naked body scanner.
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:10.000]  And when she went through, it showed up her, we call it a portacast.
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:16.000]  It is implanted in her chest, which is a medical device.
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:22.000]  I flown with Governor Jesse Ventura, who has a prosthetic hip and they just squeeze on him forever.
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000]  And that's why he's moving to Mexico.
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000]  He's just like, I'm getting out of East Germany.
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:27.000]  I can't handle it.
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.000]  Barbara, I got to go to other callers.
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000]  How did this end?
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:35.000]  Well, they took her in this room and they made her take her clothes off and they, you know,
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000]  felt her whole body and everything.
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000]  And she come out of the ring crying.
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.000]  They wouldn't let me go.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.000]  They're pleased now.
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000]  They've trained her to be a good, good slave.
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:48.000]  So they took an old woman who has a surgical implant in and they kept us safe from al-Qaeda.
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000]  And of course, I'm being sarcastic, saying good.
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:54.000]  What's your take on this, Barbara?
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000]  It's worse than Nazi Germany.
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.000]  Oh, Nazi Germany.
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000]  They said papers, please.
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:02.000]  Here it's, we're going to squeeze your young child's genitals.
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:05.000]  And then the average scumbags in denial about this because they love it.
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:06.000]  Don't worry.
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000]  The government's going to take your pension funds.
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.000]  Don't worry.
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:12.000]  They didn't just shoot up little kids with syphilis in Guatemala.
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000]  They're going to hurt you all.
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:18.000]  Those of you that love the system and are cowards, you're going to get everything you want.
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000]  They're devaluing your dollar right now.
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:25.000]  Barbara, I'm sorry that happened to your friend, but America has aborted 51 million babies
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000]  because we say they're not human.
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000]  So why shouldn't they be making old ladies cry?
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000]  We are a demonic nation.
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000]  And until we repent, it's over.
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:37.000]  And there's this fetish to worship tyranny and law enforcement.
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.000]  And so it's over.
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:42.000]  Let's go ahead and talk to Emma in Georgia Flight Attendant.
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000]  You told our screeners they brutalized people.
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.000]  Go ahead, Emma.
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.000]  Hi, Alex.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:53.000]  It's Emmy and I am a 31 year flight attendant with a major carrier and I'm heading out to South America tonight.
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:58.000]  And I'm a long time listener of you and I have been watching this for many, many months now.
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:04.000]  And I just got back from Washington DC the other day and Amsterdam a month ago.
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:07.000]  And I have just, I am appalled at what I'm seeing.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:14.000]  We were in Paris about six months ago and we go through a separate, the pilots and flight attendants go through a separate screening.
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:23.000]  And the pilot, one of the pilots I was with was absolutely, every inch of his genitalia was brutalized as we were going through this.
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000]  And he was, he was beyond upset.
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:26.000]  Listen, listen, listen.
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:32.000]  I was in San Jose and watched them squeezing three year old girls.
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:37.000]  I mean, they were, let me check that little, might be al-Qaeda.
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000]  I'm sorry, ma'am, so he was freaked out.
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.000]  How hard do they squeeze?
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.000]  Well, quite a while.
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:46.000]  And he's got, I mean, the pilots have control of the airplane.
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000]  I mean, this is beyond ridiculous.
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:51.000]  And I mean, I am very opposed to this for the flying public.
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.000]  That's right.
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.000]  Let me stop you.
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:57.000]  If a pilot has to be security checked, they shouldn't even be able to fly a plane.
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.000]  I mean, give me a break.
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.000]  Thank you.
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:03.000]  And, you know, to some extent, we have access to the flight deck as well.
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000]  And, and it's weird.
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:11.000]  We are treated the same way the general public is, except sometimes we have a separate screening area and they're adding more and more of these machines.
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:18.000]  And I was going through in DC the other day and they were, they were giving you the option.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:23.000]  They were taking like 10 people through the naked body scanner and then 10 people through the regular metal detector.
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:28.000]  Well, by the time, by the time I wanted to opt out, I wanted them to say, you know, no, but they went,
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.000]  they went through the regular metal detector.
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.000]  And when I got through the other side, there was a TSA manager there.
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000]  And I said, so how do you do this?
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.000]  Is it random?
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:36.000]  He goes, yeah, it's random.
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:37.000]  I said, but I'm allowed to opt out, right?
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:40.000]  Yeah, you can opt out, but then you have to have the path down.
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.000]  And I said, oh, okay.
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000]  I said, is that always going to be that way?
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000]  And he said, well, for now it is.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000]  And I said, well, I'm worried about the radiation.
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:51.000]  He goes, there's miniscule radiation, miniscule.
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:56.000]  So they're, they're telling everybody and Alpa, the airline pilots association came out and told the,
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:00.000]  the pilots that there's no measurable radiation in the total.
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:01.000]  Total lies.
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:02.000]  The government even admits it.
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:08.000]  I read Bloomberg interagency committee on radiation, international atomic energy agency,
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:12.000]  World Health Organization, one micron of DU in your lungs.
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000]  You're getting lung cancer within 10 to 20 years.
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:18.000]  That was, I've had the head of the Army DU program, a physicist on.
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000]  They wouldn't even use it till 1991.
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:23.000]  Now they just say, man, use it, breathe it, snort it.
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.000]  No problem.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000]  This is pure evil.
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:30.000]  But again, this is a government that would shoot little children in Guatemala with syphilis.
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000]  That's ABC news, CBS.
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.000]  Nobody cares.
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:40.000]  But, but going back to this other pilot, you said that, because obviously you talked to him, you said they squeezed him.
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000]  They did in front of us.
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:46.000]  They, he was, they squeezed every inch of his genitalia up between his legs.
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:49.000]  And this was, this was, you know, eight, eight months ago.
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:54.000]  And, you know, and they, it was just, they take us randomly and decide they're going to pat down.
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:55.000]  This is in Paris.
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:56.000]  So, and I don't think it's.
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000]  And you said, no, it's worldwide.
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:14:59.000]  And you said he was freaked out.
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:00.000]  Oh, beyond.
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000]  He went and reported it.
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:03.000]  And, you know, they didn't do anything.
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000]  You know, he just reported it and he was upset.
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:08.000]  And now they're, they're trying to be a little gentler with us.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000]  But I just ask, and I'll get off because I know you.
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.000]  Let me say this.
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:18.000]  Every time I fly, and it's actually been in mainstream news, beautiful women is who they go crazy on.
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:24.000]  You know, I, who knows, I, you know, I've, I've seen it all.
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000]  What was the other point you wanted to make?
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:32.000]  Well, the other point I wanted to make is I'm asking everyone out there, please decide if you want to trade your freedom for security.
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:33.000]  We have to all opt out.
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000]  We have to all say no.
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.000]  I would rather have the path down than the naked body scan.
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:42.000]  I don't want to be patted down, but we've got to stop, start objecting to that.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.000]  All right.
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:44.000]  Great point.
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.000]  By the way, they lied for a year and said they weren't saving the naked body images.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.000]  Guess what they are.
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:16:17.000]  We'll be back.
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:44.000]  We'll be back.

[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:56.000]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:59.000]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:04.000]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:10.000]  I've determined its influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots.
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:15.000]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:18.000]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:25.000]  The criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:31.000]  They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:38.000]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:54.000]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:58.000]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:04.000]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:10.000]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:14.000]  Number three, in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:18.000]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:21.000]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:25.000]  Every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:30.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:35.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:09.000]  Okay, the number to join us is 888-201-2244, 888-201-2244.
[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:14.000]  If you have been abused or witnessed abuse going on with the enhanced pat downs,
[01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:19.000]  and notice how it's always more, more, more, and they want to take everything they're doing on the airports
[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000]  and put it on the streets of America and worldwide.
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:28.000]  Our own federal government has promised billions of dollars of aid even to Europe to put the scanners in.
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000]  Italy has removed them.
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000]  Britain is moving towards that.
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:35.000]  There's a major backlash to this.
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:41.000]  And if the system gets this through, they're able to create these federal cadres in every country
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:44.000]  that are on the streets searching and abusing everyone.
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:49.000]  And before I go back to your calls, Jerry, John, John, and many others that are holding,
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:54.000]  I want you to search the term Stanford Prison Experiment.
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:21:04.000]  In 1971, the psychology professor, Philip Zimbardo, did a test to see if they could get people to torture folks
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:09.000]  who they thought were really being tortured if they were ordered to torture.
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:13.000]  And they found that over 90% would torture people to death,
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000]  and they believed they were killing people but still did it.
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:19.000]  So they're simply creating a giant psychological laboratory.
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000]  You're getting the big secret here.
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:29.000]  To create this federal goon minimum wage police force to go out and do whatever they want in the name of fighting terror.
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:33.000]  And that's why the government has been caught staging the terror over and over again,
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:36.000]  and that is coming up.
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:40.000]  But to listen to these stories, and I've witnessed it with my own eyes,
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:45.000]  it is so incredible to see what's happened to the land of the free, the home of the brave,
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:49.000]  but we can defeat these naked body scanners, the pat-downs, all of it.
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:54.000]  You know what? You got a better chance of being struck by lightning of drowned,
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:22:01.000]  of dying, swimming in a lake, of being in a car wreck, of anything than terrorism.
[01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:05.000]  We have more people than present in any other country in the world.
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:08.000]  We're a police state. It is big business.
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:17.000]  And this is the induction and the indoctrination of everyone into something that surpasses 1984.
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:21.000]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jerry in Michigan. Jerry, you're on the air.
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:26.000]  Hey, Alex. First of all, let me thank you and all of your crew for the work that you do.
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:27.000]  Thank you.
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:33.000]  I've been a fighter in the Info War for quite a few years now, thanks to you and people like you.
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:38.000]  I'm a frequent flyer and I hold elite status with several airlines.
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:45.000]  So I'm well aware of the Stasi slash Nazi Gestapo tactics that the TSA use.
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:48.000]  Both my wife and I are frequent travelers.
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:54.000]  And with the information that I obtained from you and other independent websites,
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:23:00.000]  I have been able to help educate my spouse and friends and family to backscatter radiation.
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:07.000]  And the biggest thing there is you have to maintain your dignity as a human being.
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:15.000]  It's important that you hold your head high, not get angry and engage these people with dignity and respect of a human being.
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:19.000]  Yeah, you need to shame them and let them understand.
[01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:24.000]  But I've thought many times when I'm thinking about them pulling me out with the naked body scanners,
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:27.000]  they haven't yet what I'm going to say to them.
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:30.000]  But I'm going to say, look, you're being radiated worse than I am.
[01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:33.000]  Hey, did you know the head of Al Qaeda meets at the Pentagon?
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:36.000]  Hey, did you know this is all staged?
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:41.000]  The military industrial complex wants to have a pretext to turn us basically into their new market
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:45.000]  and turn this whole country and the world into a control grid.
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:53.000]  And but I just can't believe we're having to have this discussion. Jerry, go ahead.
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:59.000]  Well, you have to be subtle. You have to really sit there and look, I go, I travel all the time.
[01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:03.000]  You go through one of these screening points, you look them in the face, you say, I opt out.
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:08.000]  And you smile, they make, they shout across the room and make this big commotion.
[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:14.000]  They literally put their hands all around your genitals.
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:19.000]  They spread you and they're putting so much pressure they can almost knock you over.
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:29.000]  And after doing that, I say, wow, you have to do this to women, children, old ladies, mothers, brothers, sisters,
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:34.000]  and say the things that you do, but make it matter of fact. Call it out.
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:41.000]  Well, here's the problem. The people that have a soul, they quit or get fired.
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:47.000]  And so again, they're sifting through all these people, all these blue-collar folks that can't get a job now.
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:50.000]  Our economy is converting over to the police state. That's openly been announced.
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:55.000]  That's our new economy is this predatory cannibalistic system.
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:58.000]  And they're finding people who love it.
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:01.000]  So what do they say when you bring up, hey, you got to do this to children?
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:05.000]  Because you mentioned the fact that they lift them up off the ground. That's what I've seen.
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:11.000]  That's what even mainstream news reports with reporters this is happening to is it's, quote, brutal.
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:18.000]  I mean, they just grab you and squeeze your genitals. I mean, it's a joke, okay?
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:24.000]  The terrorists are the government. They blew up the towers. They did it all to bring this in.
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:28.000]  And you people that cling to this and won't wake up and come out for 9-Eleven Truth,
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:31.000]  you're the reason these terrorists are getting away with it.
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:34.000]  And they're building an army of darkness to carry this out on us.
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:37.000]  Jerry, what do they say when you bring it up to them?
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:44.000]  Most of them, when you do that, you can sense their comfort level is all over the place.
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:48.000]  They just don't like doing it, but obviously they have to put food on the table.
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:53.000]  Yeah, because they took our jobs with globalism. I appreciate your call.
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:56.000]  And now all they can give us is tyranny.
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:01.000]  Oh, man, John in Texas, I got to go quick now. John, tell us your story.
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:04.000]  Hey, Alex, I just want to reiterate what the last caller said.
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:07.000]  Thank you for what you do and what your staff does.
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:12.000]  My wife and family, we were flying out of a small airport in South Texas.
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:17.000]  I prepared my wife for what was going to happen before we went in.
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000]  I said, we're not going through the body scan.
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:24.000]  Was it El Paso? Because El Paso Times reports everyone is forced to do it there.
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000]  Corpus Christi.
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000]  Okay, what happened, John?
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:32.000]  My wife is expecting a child. It'll be our third child.
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000]  We walked up.
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000]  I bet they thought that was a bomb.
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:40.000]  They're like, we can't radio you, baby. You're al-Qaeda. So what happened, John?
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:44.000]  We walked up and said, we're not going through there.
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:45.000]  They said, you have to.
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:48.000]  We said, well, no, I'm sorry, we're not going through there.
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:51.000]  My wife said, I'm expecting, she said, I'm not going through there in my condition.
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:55.000]  They said, oh, on that case, here you go. They allowed us through.
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:56.000]  Let me stop you.
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:02.000]  First, they tried to deny the opt-out. It's just like vaccines. There's no law you got to take them.
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:05.000]  But they say, sign this form that you opt-out so they put you in a database.
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000]  There's no law. They just do it.
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:12.000]  Same thing here. Oh, you've got to. But when they figured out they couldn't buffalo you, okay, we'll let you through.
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000]  Not a problem.
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:21.000]  We went through the metal detectors. They said, okay, wrap that down you, the kids, the wife, everybody.
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:28.000]  And it was anybody that doesn't believe that these so-called pat-downs aren't intrusive or they're out of their minds.
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:34.000]  I mean, a two-year-old son couldn't hold his hand. They said, step back, sat him right there.
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:37.000]  Oh, that's another thing. They love to isolate old people and small children.
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:43.000]  And children are crying as the big, big woman sits there.
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:49.000]  The man squeezes all over him. Every pedophile in America is getting a job at the TSA. Go ahead.
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:57.000]  Six-year-old, same thing. My wife said it was physically uncomfortable the way they grabbed her breast, between the legs and everything.
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:01.000]  Well, they're wearing latex gloves, I guess, plastic gloves whenever they're doing the pat-down.
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000]  Yeah, because you're dirty.
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:09.000]  After they pat you down, they're supposed to scan these for some type of chemicals that you may be bringing into the airport.
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:18.000]  Well, the head NSA guy behind the counter noticed that they didn't have their gloves scanned after they pat him down
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:22.000]  and told them to go back and do it again if they're padded down a second time.
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:27.000]  By the way, they're saving your DNA. You know it's declassified. They take babies' blood at birth secretly.
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:33.000]  But it's okay to shoot up kids with syphilis. This is a loving group of eugenicists doing this for our own good.
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:37.000]  So the end of the story is your wife and children got groped twice?
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000]  That's correct.
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:40.000]  Life.
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:41.000]  Anything else you want to tell us?
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:45.000]  I don't think we're flying. No sir, I don't think we're flying anymore.
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:48.000]  I'm telling all my friends and family about the experience. They feel the same way.
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:29:17.000]  Alright, good job. We'll be right back with more calls.
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:26.000]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:55.000]  Let me tell you a little bit about one of our great sponsors, HomeGain.com.

[01:31:44.000 --> 01:32:09.000]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road. But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:18.000]  Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:23.000]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:29.000]  Blue diamond gussets got it. Others don't.
[01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:35.000]  We turned jeans inside out. Diamond gusset jeans. Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:42.000]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.
[01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:49.000]  Order yours at gusset.com. Diamond gusset jeans got it. Others don't.
[01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:24.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, I know it is hard for you to listen to these callers, but you are going to experience it.
[01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:32.000]  And a lot of people with charity, when they get violated, they make psychological excuses and decide to go along with it because it's too scary.
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:38.000]  And that's what the global psychological warfare experts are hoping for.
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:43.000]  None of this has to do with terror. Everything going on in the airports admittedly.
[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:49.000]  I told you this nine years ago, now it's all over the place, is to be deployed on the streets of this country.
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:54.000]  Police taking blood.
[01:33:54.000 --> 01:34:03.000]  Police taking blood. Police taking blood under federal grants everywhere to stop drunk drivers.
[01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:06.000]  Nothing to do with it. They always use an excuse about it's good for you.
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:10.000]  And again, if you're a new listener and heard me talk about babies having their blood taken secretly,
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:15.000]  I was sent almost 15 years ago by a nurse in San Antonio involved with the Army.
[01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:16.000]  I'm leaving it at that.
[01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:24.000]  Secret documents about blood being secretly taken from all babies at birth since 1972.
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:28.000]  Years later, I had representatives from Congress on. I had members of the Australian government on.
[01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:35.000]  It's a global UN program.
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:40.000]  That's what's so scary is I study this all the time. I'm the leading expert on this.
[01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:45.000]  It's all I do. I'm here on Sunday night. All I do is study this.
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:48.000]  All I do is research it.
[01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:57.000]  And war on a locking number one in Al Qaeda is run by the CIA, Fox News.
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:02.000]  I hear all these people, oh, let's send money or buy phone cards for the troops.
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:05.000]  I think that's great. The average military man or woman is a great person.
[01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000]  They join because they do care.
[01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:10.000]  But what about not doing experiments on them?
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:17.000]  What about not using DU on them as weapons that they use on their enemies that kills them?
[01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:21.000]  Jaren just put something on screen and it's incredible.
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:29.000]  The Drudge Report has taken my link that's been up for two days, two and a half days now since Friday,
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:33.000]  and put it back to the top. And it's so incredible, Jaren.
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:36.000]  This is how tuned into this I am 30 minutes ago.
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:39.000]  And I've got to start telling people this stuff when I know what's going on.
[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:45.000]  Because maybe three, four times a year, coast to coast AM calls to get me on.
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:49.000]  My phone at home just rings off the hook and I'm in there eating dinner and the phone's ringing.
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000]  She goes, why are you getting up? You don't usually get up.
[01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:54.000]  And I said, you know, it's coast to coast AM.
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:36:00.000]  And I went in there and it was coast to coast AM to have me on Wednesday night for two hours.
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:05.000]  And I almost earlier said, Matt Drudge, I know you listen to the show.
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000]  We appreciate what you're doing.
[01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000]  Why don't you put my link at the top?
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:12.000]  Let's beat these people, but I didn't do it.
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:18.000]  And then Jaren puts it up on screen and it's just gone to the top link at DrudgeReport.com.
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:19.000]  Put that back up.
[01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:20.000]  What's that headline?
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:25.000]  It says Big Sis. Yeah, just blow up the full screen.
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:28.000]  That TV screen's 10 feet away. I can't read that there.
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000]  I know Prism Planet.TV viewers can.
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:36.000]  Big Sis backlash after T.S. Sage and I tell you, groping, opt out, embrace yourself.
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000]  Whoa!
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:46.000]  Man, I tell you, I don't get into psychic stuff and all the rest of it, but holy mackerel.
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:53.000]  That's incredible.
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000]  All right, that's wild.
[01:36:55.000 --> 01:37:01.000]  People are sick of this and if the globalists can be beaten here, they can be turned back on everything.
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000]  And you bet they're going to bomb other stuff.
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000]  You bet they're going to stage other events.
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:09.000]  And look, John, Sean, Victoria, Josh, Gale.
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000]  I've never done overdrive on the Sunday show.
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:17.000]  Are we set up to even go into a third hour here?
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:18.000]  Are we even set up?
[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000]  Because I've got all this financial news.
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:24.000]  They've openly announced the world government.
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:25.000]  I mean, look at this.
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:32.000]  Noam Chomsky, who's attacked me and others, top liberal, had said there was no evidence that 9-11 was an inside job.
[01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:35.000]  He's now come out and said no evidence that Al-Qaeda carried out 9-11 attacks.
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:39.000]  He said it on TV and basically came out and said it may be staged.
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000]  We're winning on that front.
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:42.000]  Look at this.
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:46.000]  Britain urges action over extremist U.S. website, Reuters.
[01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:49.000]  And who runs this U.S. website?
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000]  RevolutionMuslim.com.
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:54.000]  Anwar Alalaki.
[01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000]  The CIA lackey.
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:57.000]  Fox News.
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:01.000]  Exclusive Al-Qaeda leader dined at the Pentagon just months after 9-11.
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:02.000]  I just want to say this.
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000]  Thank God for Matt Drudge.
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000]  Long before Glenn Beck would tell the truth about world government.
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:14.000]  Long before Limbaugh would, about three years ago, I started seeing Matt Drudge cover world government, new world order, all these issues.
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:17.000]  And Matt, we appreciate you and we know you're listening.
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000]  That's awesome.
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000]  Wow.
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:22.000]  That is exciting.
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:23.000]  And I've got all these callers here.
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:27.000]  John, Sean, Victoria, Josh, Gail and others.
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000]  We're going to beat these machines.
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000]  We're going to beat them together.
[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:32.000]  Oh boy.
[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:37.000]  Haven't even gotten into the former part officer, gets two years for shooting the guy in the back cold bloodedly.
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:38.000]  But that's not the issue.
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000]  They murdered that guy and that's wrong.
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:49.000]  But they took three cell phone cameras on the platform at the train station and then lied and said that he'd fought them.
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:54.000]  And then somebody on a train pulling up and stopping shot the whole deal that they didn't get that camera.
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:55.000]  Thank God.
[01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:59.000]  And when they shoot him in the back in handcuffs, he's done nothing.
[01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:00.000]  He's put him in handcuffs.
[01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000]  Then they get him up and say, stop it.
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:06.000]  You know, you're bad to start roughing him up after they shot him in the back.
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:10.000]  The bullet went through, bounced back up and back into his heart.
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:19.000]  Then they took their sweet time getting into the hospital because, you know, a dead victim is better than an undead victim.
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:24.000]  The issue is they lied about it and said he'd attack them.
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000]  I mean, it's the government.
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:27.000]  Look at history.
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000]  Look at what governments do.
[01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:30.000]  Look at the abuse.
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:31.000]  Look at the corruption.
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000]  Look at everything that goes on.
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:34.000]  Stop it.
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:35.000]  Wake up.
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:36.000]  Get involved.
[01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:37.000]  Say no.
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:42.000]  And I heard that father with his wife and his children being fondled twice because they didn't save the glove.
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000]  You know, on your jeans is your DNA.
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:45.000]  I'll guarantee you.
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:46.000]  I have no proof of this.
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:51.000]  When I don't have proof, I'll tell you, but my guts always 100%.
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000]  I had the documents on the blood taken.
[01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:54.000]  Now that's mainstream news.
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000]  The secret blood draws on babies at birth.
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:02.000]  And I had the executive ordered about the police to be federalized to take blood to claim it's for DUIs, really for DNA database,
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:05.000]  and to train a cadre of police to take blood.
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:13.000]  But when my gut tells me, I'll guarantee you, because off your clothes, anything, when they're keeping those gloves and marking your name on them,
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:14.000]  they're saving them.
[01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:18.000]  Just like I knew a year and a half ago, the TSA was saving those images.
[01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000]  My gut knew it.
[01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:26.000]  Then I searched the patents and the companies and the training manuals and guess what they were online.
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:33.000]  And a year ago, we wrote articles saying the manual says for the naked body scanners, I'm a photographer.
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:34.000]  I'm a videographer.
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:35.000]  Okay.
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:41.000]  And in college, they trained you to zoom in on the crow's feet at the corner of somebody's eyes or their retina.
[01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:49.000]  And that when you can see the clear streaks in someone's retina, that the camera is focused.
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:58.000]  What does the TSA tell its workers to look at in the scan to make sure that it's focused?
[01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:02.000]  They describe the female genitals and the male genitals.
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:06.000]  They look at the genitals to make sure it's tuned and focused.
[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:07.000]  And let me expand on this.
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:08.000]  In fact, they won't believe it.
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:09.000]  Search the term.
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:10.000]  I've done it before.
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:23.000]  Body scans for better fit in clothing or body scans at clothears, body scans at malls.
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:32.000]  Nine years ago, the same globalists patented and now they're going in everywhere, body scanners, where you step in, it scans you.
[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:40.000]  360, but the companies then sell that data to see now they've got passive MRIs on the streets.
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:48.000]  That's that's BBC and wire magazine that look through your clothes, through your clothes.
[01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:54.000]  And create a body scan just like they have license plate reading cameras or face scanning distance cameras.
[01:41:54.000 --> 01:42:00.000]  They even if you wear a mask, they can look through your clothes with these millimeter wave systems.
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:06.000]  A body scanner, but they've got to have your name attached.
[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:12.000]  Just like going back 15 years ago, nationwide, we had a national ID still do, but they had announced it to last few years.
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:15.000]  Real ID, they make you thumbprint and take a digital photo.
[01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:19.000]  That's a face scan, the thumbprint attached to your name for the global database.
[01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000]  That's all admitted.
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:24.000]  This is all admitted.
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:31.000]  So they body scan you at the airport to get your body 360 biometric scan.
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:32.000]  That's admitted.
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:40.000]  Now, as for the gloves, I'll guarantee you they're taking them off, marking them down with your name for DNA processing.
[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000]  This is a criminal government.
[01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:43.000]  Look into eugenics.
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000]  Look into my film in game.
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:49.000]  I'm going to come back and talk to your, your calls, callers straight ahead.
[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000]  Stay with us.
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:55.000]  Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:59.000]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:05.000]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:06.000]  It's true.
[01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:11.000]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:15.000]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:19.000]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:22.000]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:26.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:31.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:36.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors.

[01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:55.000]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:58.000]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:03.000]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:09.000]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:15.000]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:18.000]  Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:25.000]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:29.000]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches.
[01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:38.000]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:43.000]  Get your copy of Full of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[01:45:43.000 --> 01:46:12.000]  We're watching online right now at superhighqualityatprisonplanet.tv.
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:17.000]  You should consider a food savings account from eFoodsDirect.

[01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:24.000]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.

[01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:44.000]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com on the Internet, or call 800-409-5633.
[01:46:44.000 --> 01:47:09.000]  That's eFoodsDirect.com, or 800-409-5633.
[01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:21.000]  I'm coming up this week, but you better believe I'm going to do probably a whole three, four hour show.
[01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:26.000]  Just on the naked body scanners of people that have been abused, I appreciate everybody holding.
[01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:32.000]  I didn't even get into the economic news, or the government stage terror news, ex-Clinton strategist,
[01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:39.000]  Obama needs events similar to OKC to reconstruct and reconnect with voters.
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:43.000]  That's a new official saying that, Democratic operative Mark Penn.
[01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:48.000]  But I'm going to jam in John, Victoria, Josh, Gale, and Pat, who have been holding the longest.
[01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000]  I'll be back tomorrow at 11 a.m. Central.
[01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000]  But awesome for the Drudge Report.
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:48:01.000]  Top super link, our video of my employee, Michelle, being molested with her children by the TSA.
[01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000]  And that's what it is, and it's out of control.
[01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000]  Police can't even do that.
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000]  John in Los Angeles, you're on the air.
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000]  Hi, Alex. Thanks for having me.
[01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000]  Welcome, sir. What's on your mind?
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:16.000]  I'll make it fast. One is, a couple of years ago in California, they passed a proposition that set up.
[01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:21.000]  If your cue is a felony, they're going to create a DNA database that collects your DNA and you can't do anything.
[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:22.000]  The voters approved it.
[01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:26.000]  Exactly. If you're not even arrested, they put you in a DNA database.
[01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000]  If you're not, it'd be exactly.
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:33.000]  Also, Zimbabwe in Sanford, I think, had another experiment where they took the residents to the basement,
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:38.000]  put them up between prison guards and prisoners, and they took the both most seriously,
[01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:43.000]  which became so bad, kind of like Oz on television, that their school forced them to stop the program
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000]  because they realized how damaging it was for their mental health.
[01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:50.000]  Now, they found over 90% of people, when ordered to murder someone by an authority figure, will do it.
[01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:54.000]  So the government is going out and finding people that will do these things
[01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:57.000]  and trying to force these absurd things on us.
[01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:00.000]  Because if we'll put up with our baby's blood being taken secretly at birth,
[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:04.000]  or the government every week going, yeah, we're killing kids in medical experiments,
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:10.000]  or what were the good guys, if we'll put up with Bill Gates releasing mosquitoes with vaccines in them,
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:11.000]  we'll put up with anything.
[01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:14.000]  They're just trying to overwhelm us and break our will.
[01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:18.000]  Victoria in Montana, you're on the air.
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:22.000]  I wanted to let you know that in July in Atlanta,
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:30.000]  I observed the TSA workers selecting top heavy women to put through the naked body scanners ahead of me.
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:38.000]  They seem not to be consciously aware that people around them could see them drooling and selectively choosing people.
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:43.000]  Oh, yeah, there's even been Wall Street Journal articles of their reporters watching The Hotter the Woman.
[01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:47.000]  These men literally, in fact, that's come out on the news,
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:51.000]  that they even make good-looking women at the airports who work at the airports go through.
[01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:55.000]  There's been lawsuits and they come up and say, baby, you're good looking.
[01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:58.000]  I mean, this is not my opinion. It's a bunch of pervs.
[01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:01.000]  It's tyranny. I'm sorry, Victoria.
[01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:04.000]  So I saw this in San Jose last Tuesday.
[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000]  It was nothing, not one man.
[01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:09.000]  I sat there for 20 minutes hoping I'd see a man.
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000]  It was little kids and women.
[01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:16.000]  I mean, why do you think they're doing that to women mainly because they submit
[01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:19.000]  or because they like to squeeze their genitals?
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:20.000]  What's going on?
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:27.000]  I just think they're doing it because they're perverts and they want the pictures and everything just looking at that behavior.
[01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:30.000]  Well, I'm tall, curvaceous, and I have, like, a triple D top.
[01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:35.000]  So I had a feeling they would try to force me in the body scanner.
[01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000]  So they tried to and I said, no.
[01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000]  And then the man, he got really upset.
[01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:42.000]  He tried to pick an argument to convince me and force me, but I stood firm.
[01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000]  I said, no, I will not be convinced.
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:48.000]  Yeah, they try to pressure you and we all need to say no and no to their pat-downs.
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:52.000]  Their bosses staged the terror attacks, a locky CIA.
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000]  The government admits they're growing the opium.
[01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000]  They're taking babies blood secretly.
[01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:59.000]  They radiated 4,000 plus foster kids to death.
[01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:00.000]  It's all declassified.
[01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:04.000]  This government's bankrupt, murdering criminals and it's over.
[01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:05.000]  Victoria, thank you.
[01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:08.000]  Josh in Virginia, you're on the air.
[01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:09.000]  Hi, Alex.
[01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:10.000]  This is Josh.
[01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:11.000]  I'm calling from Virginia Beach.
[01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:19.000]  I was visiting some family this weekend and I've got an in-law who actually works for Homeland Security.
[01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:22.000]  He actually does repairs on these machines around the country.
[01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000]  And I said something very interesting to me.
[01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:31.000]  We were talking about how they're implementing these machines, you know, everywhere, sporting events, shopping malls, all that stuff.
[01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:38.000]  Well, he said one of the places he goes to a lot now is Chicago because they have these machines in a middle school.
[01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:42.000]  And he says, oh, the kids are always breaking them because, you know, they don't like them.
[01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000]  And I don't know if you've heard anything about this.
[01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:47.000]  No, but let me stop you.
[01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:58.000]  Four months ago, we got a call from a person, a pilot in memory service saying, I go through and fly out of Texas.
[01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000]  It was El Paso.
[01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000]  And he said, everyone must go through.
[01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:03.000]  We searched.
[01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:07.000]  Everyone body scanned at El Paso and it was El Paso times.
[01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:10.000]  So let's see if we can do this the next six months before the show's over.
[01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:16.000]  Let's search Chicago Middle School installs body scanners or school.
[01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000]  Listen, you think I know everything?
[01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000]  I don't know Jack Squad.
[01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:21.000]  That's what's so scary.
[01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:24.000]  I studied this 18 hours a day.
[01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:31.000]  And six months ago, I was sent a video of a lawyer suing in Denver over the naked body scanners.
[01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:39.000]  And I didn't know that hundreds of federal and hundreds of state courthouses already had a man two years ago again.
[01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:42.000]  So, so no, no, I didn't know about this.
[01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:47.000]  They're in the schools now, radiating children every day.
[01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:52.000]  I didn't get the specifics, but he did say that it was in a rougher area of Chicago.
[01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000]  And he was actually, you know, supportive of the idea.
[01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:57.000]  He said, oh, you wouldn't believe what we found on these kids.
[01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:01.000]  They're so bad, you know, that, you know, inner city kids don't know how to, you know, but.
[01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:04.000]  Meanwhile, he said he classified CI program to get the kids on drugs.
[01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:05.000]  Sorry.
[01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:06.000]  Exactly.
[01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:09.000]  I mean, they're going to try and implement these into the schools.
[01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:10.000]  Not high school.
[01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:11.000]  This is the middle school we're talking about.
[01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:15.000]  I mean, you know how these guys love to, you know, search the children and this is just too much.
[01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:16.000]  Well, they got to get them.
[01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000]  They got to get them while they're young.
[01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:19.000]  Josh, great point.
[01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:22.000]  Gail in California, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:25.000]  Hey Alex, great hearing you and Santa Cruz.
[01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:26.000]  My horror story.
[01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:27.000]  I had a flash.
[01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:31.000]  My dad's funeral went to San Jose airport.
[01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:35.000]  They took my bags through them on the thing.
[01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000]  Totally destroyed them.
[01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:40.000]  They had to duct tape them to get them closed again.
[01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000]  Then they told me to step aside.
[01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:48.000]  They got on the intercom and they said, we need two security guards over here immediately.
[01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:52.000]  And they may sit us right by the, the gate.
[01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000]  Everybody's turning around looking at me.
[01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000]  They come over here to security guards.
[01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:57.000]  The female comes up.
[01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000]  I had two males sitting outside of me.
[01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:00.000]  They totally frisked me.
[01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:03.000]  Then they take my shoes, run them through the scanner.
[01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:07.000]  I guess since you've had a father training you that you're bad, training you that you're a terrorist.
[01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:10.000]  Meanwhile, their bosses carried out 9-11.
[01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000]  They are, they are the terrorists.
[01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000]  They work for the terrorists, Gail.
[01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:18.000]  Yeah, and everybody's saying, I'm looking at me like, I'm, I'm, I'm, I mean, I got in the plane.
[01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:22.000]  And when I got in the plane, everybody's just staring at me like I was some kind of freak.
[01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:23.000]  Well Gail, that's another good point.
[01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:28.000]  We have had, because my, my crews fly every two weeks or so to interview people for video.
[01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000]  And they break our bags all the time.
[01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:31.000]  I appreciate your call.
[01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000]  Colonel Six in Texas.
[01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:34.000]  You're on the air.
[01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:35.000]  Go ahead.
[01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000]  Hey, Alex.
[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:38.000]  Yes, sir.
[01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:39.000]  Hello.
[01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:40.000]  You're on the air.
[01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:41.000]  I'll tell you what.
[01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:47.000]  Walk, walk up in the military uniform and tell them that you, and, and see if they'll try it with you.
[01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:50.000]  That's when they read the Patriot Act.
[01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000]  They haven't because they can't read.
[01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:55.000]  Most of them are 12, where I got 6th grade educations.
[01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:58.000]  It's like part in the Red Sea.
[01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000]  Let me tell you something else too.
[01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:11.000]  I want you to look at, at uh, colonelsix.com about another type of body searches that's going on with Ohio Army National, Ohio Army National Guard.
[01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:14.000]  What's going on?
[01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:22.000]  Uh, recruiters having, uh, female recruits, uh, service them.
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:23.000]  Oh, I've seen that in the news.
[01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:24.000]  Colonel Six, I'm out of time.
[01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000]  Pat in Florida, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:27.000]  Last caller.
[01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:28.000]  Go ahead.
[01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:31.000]  Hi, I'm glad you took my call.
[01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:36.000]  I'm 65 year old woman with a good shape, but I'm also in a wheelchair.
[01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:40.000]  And, um, I was wearing, I'm in a lot of pain.
[01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000]  I've wear a thermo care.
[01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:47.000]  There are heat packs on my spine, on my legs, and on my neck.
[01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:53.000]  And, uh, there was myself and another woman in a wheelchair, a woman much older than me.
[01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:58.000]  They pulled us out a line and they said, you have to get undressed.
[01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:02.000]  And because of the thermo care I made, the, uh,
[01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:05.000]  Oh yeah, they take folks behind closed doors and strip search them.
[01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:08.000]  In some cases they strip search in public.
[01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000]  No amount of humiliation is enough.
[01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:11.000]  Go ahead.
[01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000]  Well, they wanted to do it in public.
[01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:14.000]  They wanted to do it right there.
[01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:18.000]  And I said, no, you're not going to do it to me right there.
[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:19.000]  Take me into the ladies room.
[01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:26.000]  And the other woman was like hysterical crying, they're going to strip search of me, you know, in, in public.
[01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:30.000]  And I said, just, I turned to her and I said, don't let them.
[01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000]  And she said, what am I going to do?
[01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:35.000]  And I said, just do what I'm going to do.
[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:38.000]  And so I just told her, I, she saw what I did.
[01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:43.000]  I said, no, you cannot do it here in front of all these people, you know, the big, long lines.
[01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:48.000]  I mean, I was either a candidate in Newark airport and there's, you know,
[01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:49.000]  hundreds of people there.
[01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:52.000]  And so I said, you can take me to the ladies room.
[01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:58.000]  And when she took me into the ladies room, I sat to her by the way, I have two liver diseases.
[01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:03.000]  And she heard that she that ended it.
[01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:06.000]  And this has nothing to do with stopping terror.
[01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:09.000]  It's about training you that government puts its hands on you.
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:12.000]  The feds are seizing all transportation.
[01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:15.000]  It violates the 10th and 9th amendment.
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:18.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, the government is criminal.

[01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:29.000]  through secret chemical, biological, radiological tests.
[01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:35.000]  The number one killer of people outside of natural death and diseases is government.
[01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:36.000]  Wake up and say no to the tyranny.
[01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:40.000]  See you back live tomorrow, 11 a.m. Central.

[01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:46.000]  Tyranny is here.
[01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:50.000]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:58.000]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:05.000]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:11.000]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state.

[01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:29.000]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:32.000]  It's here.
