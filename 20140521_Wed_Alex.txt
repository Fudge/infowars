[00:00.000 --> 00:09.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:09.000 --> 00:10.000]  You want answers?
[00:10.000 --> 00:12.000]  Well, so does he.
[00:12.000 --> 00:16.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:16.000 --> 00:40.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:40.000 --> 00:48.000]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, Obama is standing behind Shinseki on Veterans Administration scandal.
[00:48.000 --> 00:50.000]  And there's a reason for that.
[00:50.000 --> 00:56.000]  We're going to play the clip of Bill Gates coming up where he talks about death panels and how you kill one old lady.
[00:56.000 --> 00:58.000]  You can hire 10 teachers.
[00:58.000 --> 01:04.000]  They are selling the idea that someone has to lose for you to gain.
[01:04.000 --> 01:16.000]  They shrink the size of the pie. They sell the idea that a collapsing economy, a collapsing culture, collapsing choices, collapsing economic diversity,
[01:16.000 --> 01:26.000]  is what will deliver funds and jobs and money to the bureaucratic clash as they slit their own throats.
[01:26.000 --> 01:32.000]  And this is, of course, diametrically opposed to real economic theorem.
[01:32.000 --> 01:36.000]  It's been proven to be accurate. We're going to be breaking that down coming up today.
[01:36.000 --> 01:41.000]  And we've got a lot of VA whistleblowers coming to us.
[01:41.000 --> 01:53.000]  A senior individual at a major veterans hospital on the East Coast, that's all I can say because the person is so senior.
[01:53.000 --> 01:58.000]  Now that I think about it in hindsight, we probably should have just not even interviewed him via the phone.
[01:58.000 --> 02:04.000]  We should have done a transcript and then said what hospital?
[02:04.000 --> 02:08.000]  It doesn't matter. We're a credible news organization. We don't make up sources.
[02:08.000 --> 02:15.000]  The trolls, probably government, probably Pentagon are all over the story on infowars.com and YouTube saying, oh, we don't believe this.
[02:15.000 --> 02:22.000]  It's made up. Really? We've got a whole bunch of whistleblowers coming forward who are going to name names and who are going to say who they are.
[02:22.000 --> 02:28.000]  And we've got veterans and some of our own crew that are veterans have been going into the VA.
[02:28.000 --> 02:36.000]  And you're not going to believe what's been happening to them at the Austin VA that is listed as being involved in the death list.
[02:36.000 --> 02:41.000]  The death panels. And by the way, we've got video, everything.
[02:41.000 --> 02:48.000]  Okay, we're just trying to absorb all the intel we've got with our small organization.
[02:48.000 --> 02:56.000]  There are death lists and we've got members of the Democratic Party coming out like Bill Press.
[02:56.000 --> 03:07.000]  We have video of that coming up. Disgustingly saying it's a Republican conspiracy theory following the Hillary Bill Clinton memo from 1995.
[03:07.000 --> 03:14.000]  I mean, Bill Clinton could be caught on top of Monica Lewinsky and he would say, it's a conspiracy theory.
[03:14.000 --> 03:18.000]  Well, I mean, you're actually involved in intercourse.
[03:18.000 --> 03:25.000]  Bill, we could film a porno movie right now with you and Monica. No, that's not what that is. I'm a gynecologist.
[03:25.000 --> 03:35.000]  And, you know, we can make jokes all day about this. This is incredibly serious because they just sit up there denying everything that's going on in plain view.
[03:35.000 --> 03:46.000]  And it's a standard denial, but that video and audio is up on infowars.com. VA supervisor, older veterans should be shot in the head to save money.
[03:46.000 --> 04:00.000]  And then it gets into the whole death list where this person has to sit there in administration in these bioethics board meetings where they're deciding to deny care to Korean War and Vietnam vets.
[04:00.000 --> 04:14.000]  And there is a disdain for them. You know, my dad's a physician and he told me about the attitude of some physicians, especially newer ones, that, you know, it's just time for all folks to die.
[04:14.000 --> 04:21.000]  They don't want to nurture and deal with old ladies or old men. It's like, just go die. And this is an anti-human attitude.
[04:21.000 --> 04:27.000]  We're going to kill babies, 53 million of them. We're going to say, black people aren't humans. We're going to on and on and on.
[04:27.000 --> 04:32.000]  We're going to say, old people aren't humans. We're going to say babies aren't humans in the Journal of Bioethics.
[04:32.000 --> 04:36.000]  Remember that a few years ago? They said, kill babies up to age three.
[04:36.000 --> 04:43.000]  And Bill Gates sits there to a bunch of teachers going, if we don't give granny health care, we can hire 10 teachers.
[04:43.000 --> 04:48.000]  We're not going to give you more money, you idiot teachers. They're selling you on the idea of death.
[04:48.000 --> 04:57.000]  In Newsweek, the case for killing granny, it's disgusting. That's coming up. And more. Stay with us.
[05:18.000 --> 05:25.000]  We're going to start a revolution and process with poisons and additives. Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[05:25.000 --> 05:34.000]  All of this has been engineered by design. We can turn the tide against the eugenicists by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.
[05:34.000 --> 05:44.000]  To learn more, visit InfowarsHealth.com. The site is literally packed with audio and video featuring top health professionals who don't bow down to big pharma.

[05:59.000 --> 06:09.000]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day, but it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[06:09.000 --> 06:14.000]  Outdoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[06:14.000 --> 06:22.000]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes. There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[06:22.000 --> 06:31.000]  Well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions. And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[06:31.000 --> 06:41.000]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[06:41.000 --> 06:52.000]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA, the new InfowarsLife Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[06:52.000 --> 06:59.000]  Now available exclusively at InfowarsLife.com or by calling toll 3-888-2533139.
[06:59.000 --> 07:02.000]  This is Alex Jones for InfowarsLife.com.
[07:02.000 --> 07:10.000]  The latest in preparedness is now here, an electrically stabilized colloidal silver solution that can be added to both your home cabinet and preparedness pack alike.
[07:10.000 --> 07:15.000]  Concentrated to 30 parts per million in what has been dubbed the Survival Silver Solution.
[07:15.000 --> 07:20.000]  The new InfowarsLife Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver is the answer for you and your family.
[07:20.000 --> 07:25.000]  And it's entirely free of toxic artificial additives that are loaded into many products.
[07:25.000 --> 07:34.000]  The InfowarsLife Silver Bullet Silver is so powerful that it is concentrated into a 2 ounce bottle and is not recommended for extended continual use.
[07:34.000 --> 07:36.000]  This is not a low grade formula.
[07:36.000 --> 07:49.000]  We are working with one of the top laboratory manufacturers in the United States to bring you the best form of colloidal silver using electrical processes within a base of deionized water for your preparedness storage.

[08:19.000 --> 08:25.000]  Infowars.com Studios, it's Alex Jones.
[08:25.000 --> 08:38.000]  Every time that I look in the mirror All these lines in my face get clearer
[08:38.000 --> 08:49.000]  The past is gone I need a way to buy good life just to do
[08:49.000 --> 08:56.000]  Isn't that the way Everybody's got their dues in life to pay
[08:56.000 --> 09:00.000]  Well I know, nobody knows
[09:00.000 --> 09:10.000]  Where it comes and where it goes I don't know, it's everybody's sin
[09:10.000 --> 09:15.000]  You've got to lose some love, how long will it take
[09:15.000 --> 09:22.000]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, it is already Wednesday the 21st day of May 2014.
[09:22.000 --> 09:31.000]  Hi, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[09:31.000 --> 09:34.000]  Where to begin?
[09:34.000 --> 09:37.000]  I've got to say we have to begin with DrudgeReport.com.
[09:37.000 --> 09:41.000]  This video and audio is also up on Infowars.com.
[09:41.000 --> 09:57.000]  Jim, we've proved communism works. Joe Garcia has come out publicly during a committee hearing
[09:57.000 --> 10:01.000]  and said that we've proven communism works.
[10:01.000 --> 10:09.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, communism from North Korea to China to Russia creates unmitigated hell
[10:09.000 --> 10:14.000]  and we have been purposely maneuvered to go bankrupt and have a domesticated sickly population.
[10:14.000 --> 10:24.000]  Every metric from our IQs to our education to our income shows we're going to hell in a handbasket.
[10:24.000 --> 10:31.000]  JFK in 1961 cut the main tax rate by 50%.
[10:31.000 --> 10:35.000]  The other major tax bracket by 33%, you can look that up.
[10:35.000 --> 10:39.000]  Federal tax receipts doubled the next year.
[10:39.000 --> 10:44.000]  Why then do they want to keep raising taxes when it lowers tax receipts when it stalls the economy?
[10:44.000 --> 10:50.000]  Because the globalist by and large are exempt from the taxes they foist on us.
[10:50.000 --> 10:56.000]  Communism doesn't exist. It's a political term to con the general public back into slavery
[10:56.000 --> 11:02.000]  and to make your labor controlled by central committees who live in giant palaces
[11:02.000 --> 11:10.000]  and who suppress the population with paramilitary police wearing black uniforms and ski mask.
[11:10.000 --> 11:16.000]  But I want to play the disgusting audio of this before we get into the bomb shell VA news
[11:16.000 --> 11:22.000]  that's now broken at infowars.com and prismplanet.com.
[11:22.000 --> 11:26.000]  Let's go ahead and go to this disgusting clip of Joe Garcia. Here it is.
[11:26.000 --> 11:32.000]  We've proved that communism works. If you give everybody a good government job, there's no crime.
[11:32.000 --> 11:36.000]  But that is what we should be doing on the border, the kind of money that we've poured into there.
[11:36.000 --> 11:41.000]  And we're having a diminishing return. So while we're spending all this money here,
[11:41.000 --> 11:47.000]  we have border problems in Puerto Rico where we haven't been able to set up a system that's safe there
[11:47.000 --> 11:52.000]  and people are finding alternative routes. But the opportunity to get this right and the mistake...
[11:52.000 --> 11:56.000]  There we go. So a guy that's for communism wants open borders here.
[11:56.000 --> 12:00.000]  And then they give you a government job producing nothing.
[12:00.000 --> 12:04.000]  It doesn't matter. You can vote to control the whole country now under democracy.
[12:04.000 --> 12:08.000]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner. What's for dinner? The sheep.
[12:08.000 --> 12:14.000]  And those of us that produce are the sheep. We are disdained. We are hated. We are persecuted.
[12:14.000 --> 12:22.000]  And misery loves company. The giant unwashed masses that have grown up now, multi-generations on welfare.
[12:22.000 --> 12:26.000]  Don't care that Warren Buffett's tax exempt. Don't care that Bill Gates' tax exempt.
[12:26.000 --> 12:33.000]  Don't care that their trillions are washed through international banks and that they're above the law.
[12:33.000 --> 12:39.000]  Don't care they have jet copters. Don't care. Don't care if they have five kids when they're telling you not to have kids.
[12:39.000 --> 12:46.000]  They don't care. They hate the guy that lives in a nice house and has a nice car.
[12:46.000 --> 12:53.000]  And our journey into this abject slavery is getting really, really close, ladies and gentlemen.
[12:53.000 --> 13:03.000]  There are at least, at least 10 different Obama's Zars on record. You've heard them. We've played them here.
[13:03.000 --> 13:10.000]  It's saying that Mao Zedong and Lenin and people are wonderful and that we need communism.
[13:10.000 --> 13:17.000]  In my experience, these high-level leftist operatives are deploying a type of communism for the general public,
[13:17.000 --> 13:21.000]  but they themselves don't even understand how the tax-free foundations are running at all,
[13:21.000 --> 13:26.000]  and they are useful idiots who literally can hardly talk.
[13:26.000 --> 13:32.000]  When you get around establishment minions and even mid-level functionaries, even high-level functionaries,
[13:32.000 --> 13:39.000]  they don't know what's going on. They are useful idiots in the very sense of V.I. Lenin's quote about useful idiots.
[13:39.000 --> 13:47.000]  Here's a headline substitute teacher fired for asking fourth graders for dating advice.
[13:47.000 --> 13:56.000]  That's up in New York, investigators say. She was just asking him what she thought about the type of guys she should date,
[13:56.000 --> 14:09.000]  but it's okay to teach first graders about anal sex and to show them videos of two men kissing at a quote, gay proposal.
[14:09.000 --> 14:14.000]  That's literally promoting pedophilia, in my view. Sexualizing children.
[14:14.000 --> 14:19.000]  But then some teacher goes, hey, I'm dating a couple guys. What do you think I ought to go out with?
[14:19.000 --> 14:23.000]  Just some woman thinking about the guys she's dating, shooting her mouth off.
[14:23.000 --> 14:27.000]  Maybe she should have gotten censored. Maybe she should have gotten suspended for a week without pay.
[14:27.000 --> 14:35.000]  But no, she's fired. I always love how that is. You're fired for something petty,
[14:35.000 --> 14:39.000]  but then if it's state-sponsored, you can teach the most horrible stuff imaginary.
[14:39.000 --> 14:44.000]  That's just an example of how this system works.
[14:44.000 --> 14:47.000]  Man claims Albuquerque police caused him to lose a testicle.
[14:47.000 --> 14:50.000]  We're continuing our investigation of what's happening in Albuquerque,
[14:50.000 --> 14:55.000]  where the police are just executing people left and right and getting awards for the feds while they do it.
[14:55.000 --> 14:57.000]  That's all coming up.
[14:57.000 --> 15:02.000]  We've got huge news on the TEPCO releasing contaminated water into the sea.
[15:02.000 --> 15:05.000]  560 tons of contaminated water.
[15:05.000 --> 15:14.000]  It's bigger than the original disaster weekly as it continues to melt down five of the six reactors.
[15:14.000 --> 15:22.000]  It's just ongoing.
[15:22.000 --> 15:25.000]  So that's just some of the news on that front.
[15:25.000 --> 15:32.000]  Also, White House picking up pace on executive orders.
[15:32.000 --> 15:38.000]  And Boehner says that Obama will hit a brick wall if he continues to operate dictatorially.
[15:38.000 --> 15:40.000]  Well, not if Boehner has anything to do about it.
[15:40.000 --> 15:48.000]  Boehner is there to act like he's doing something while helping get the whole agenda through playing golf on a weekly basis with Obama.
[15:48.000 --> 15:51.000]  Also, I want to get into political correctness, mind control.
[15:51.000 --> 15:53.000]  People keep calling them idiots.
[15:53.000 --> 15:55.000]  They keep calling them morons.
[15:55.000 --> 15:59.000]  They keep calling the environmentalists wackos.
[15:59.000 --> 16:00.000]  They're not wackos.
[16:00.000 --> 16:02.000]  They're taking over our whole country.
[16:02.000 --> 16:04.000]  And the world put the smart meters into track us.
[16:04.000 --> 16:06.000]  They're shutting down our energy sources.
[16:06.000 --> 16:08.000]  They're shutting down all industry they don't control.
[16:08.000 --> 16:11.000]  They're shutting down our economy and surveillance systems to track all human activity.
[16:11.000 --> 16:14.000]  They are conquering us.
[16:14.000 --> 16:24.000]  And the average low level environmentalist means well they just don't understand the big picture.
[16:24.000 --> 16:27.000]  But now dovetailing that.
[16:27.000 --> 16:30.000]  This is out of each Greenwich newspaper.
[16:30.000 --> 16:33.000]  And they report this with a straight face.
[16:33.000 --> 16:39.000]  Well, middle school cancels honors night because it's seen as exclusive.
[16:39.000 --> 16:43.000]  And anything exclusive is deemed racist.
[16:43.000 --> 16:47.000]  And also they're saying stop using the term hump day on Wednesdays.
[16:47.000 --> 16:52.000]  That too is racist.
[16:52.000 --> 16:54.000]  And petting zoos are now racist.
[16:54.000 --> 16:55.000]  I'm not kidding.
[16:55.000 --> 16:57.000]  We're going to be breaking this down.
[16:57.000 --> 17:01.000]  Because, well, if there's a camel at it, that puts down Arabs.
[17:01.000 --> 17:04.000]  And you heard it, if you have a party with Mexican food.
[17:04.000 --> 17:06.000]  It's not because you like Mexican food.
[17:06.000 --> 17:09.000]  If you have a fiesta party and invite your friends over.
[17:09.000 --> 17:10.000]  And you don't have a pinata.
[17:10.000 --> 17:12.000]  I had pinatas almost every birthday.
[17:12.000 --> 17:13.000]  I loved them.
[17:13.000 --> 17:14.000]  It's because my parents were racist.
[17:14.000 --> 17:15.000]  Not because it was fun.
[17:15.000 --> 17:19.000]  And I asked for a pinata.
[17:19.000 --> 17:22.000]  Cowboy hats are Spanish and come from Mexico.
[17:22.000 --> 17:26.000]  So I guess it's racist that I wore a cowboy hat when I worked on ranches.
[17:26.000 --> 17:28.000]  Folks, what this is is conscious.
[17:28.000 --> 17:34.000]  Again, conscious takeover of society across the board.
[17:34.000 --> 17:38.000]  Where everything is politically incorrect and a thought crime.
[17:38.000 --> 17:40.000]  So that you won't say or do anything.
[17:40.000 --> 17:42.000]  And so anyone can be denounced at any time.
[17:42.000 --> 17:44.000]  This is right out of the Soviet Union.
[17:44.000 --> 17:48.000]  The term hate speech and hate crime is from the Soviet Union.
[17:48.000 --> 17:50.000]  It was developed in the 40s.
[17:50.000 --> 17:52.000]  Julie, hey, guess what day it is?
[17:52.000 --> 17:53.000]  Oh, come on.
[17:53.000 --> 17:54.000]  I know you can hear me.
[17:54.000 --> 17:55.000]  Okay.
[17:55.000 --> 17:57.000]  Well, if you like that commercial, you may be racist.
[17:57.000 --> 18:02.000]  The University of St. Thomas in Minnesota now canceling an event to celebrate the end
[18:02.000 --> 18:06.000]  of the year after some people complained about bringing a humpback camel.
[18:06.000 --> 18:10.000]  Now, again, folks.
[18:10.000 --> 18:13.000]  People love to have fun.
[18:13.000 --> 18:18.000]  And they're now saying that, you know, if you want to get a midget for your birthday party,
[18:18.000 --> 18:20.000]  well, that's how some of those folks make money.
[18:20.000 --> 18:26.000]  That's how ancient gestures in most courts from China to England were dwarves and midgets.
[18:26.000 --> 18:30.000]  They would say the word war for midget is, quote, you know, mean now.
[18:30.000 --> 18:32.000]  They're taking every term and making it bad.
[18:32.000 --> 18:34.000]  And sure, it would be fun.
[18:34.000 --> 18:38.000]  I would think if it's fun for the person coming to do it, they choose to make money doing that.
[18:38.000 --> 18:39.000]  Is that something bad?
[18:39.000 --> 18:41.000]  You could even argue that's bad.
[18:41.000 --> 18:45.000]  But now it's going to move on to a camel offends one Arab.
[18:45.000 --> 18:48.000]  So you can't have a camel in a petting suit.
[18:48.000 --> 18:54.000]  Or you can't have valor Victorians or an honors event.
[18:54.000 --> 18:56.000]  That's like saying, well, they're getting rid of dodgeball.
[18:56.000 --> 18:59.000]  They're getting rid of sports at a lot of schools because see all the kids can't win.
[18:59.000 --> 19:01.000]  Well, that's how life is.
[19:01.000 --> 19:03.000]  Some people are better looking.
[19:03.000 --> 19:05.000]  Some people are better at math.
[19:05.000 --> 19:07.000]  Some people are better at social skills.
[19:07.000 --> 19:10.000]  Some people are better at mechanical type things.
[19:10.000 --> 19:14.000]  Some people like working in the fields.
[19:14.000 --> 19:18.000]  Some people just aren't as smart as others.
[19:18.000 --> 19:26.000]  And so they literally want to lower everyone else to the standards of whatever they said.
[19:26.000 --> 19:27.000]  It's an attack on women.
[19:27.000 --> 19:28.000]  It's an attack on men.
[19:28.000 --> 19:31.000]  It's an attack on heterosexuals.
[19:31.000 --> 19:35.000]  The existence of heterosexuals is hateful.
[19:35.000 --> 19:41.000]  That's taught on many universities that all sex between a man and a woman is rape.
[19:41.000 --> 19:44.000]  That's the standard feminist line.
[19:44.000 --> 19:53.000]  That's not feminist. That's CIA exterminism to screw up the male-female relationship to destabilize society.
[19:53.000 --> 19:57.000]  And now you can't have honors night and you can't have a petting zoo.
[19:57.000 --> 20:26.000]  This is the Total Charity.
[20:28.000 --> 20:31.000]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.

[23:59.000 --> 24:27.000]  Music playing
[24:27.000 --> 24:38.000]  Bill Press went further. He went on television on the Rockefeller Channel, state-funded MSNBC, and said that it's a Republican conspiracy theory.
[24:38.000 --> 24:47.000]  There's no problems at the VA. There's no suicides. There's no death list, even though they're on record to exist. None of that is happening.
[24:47.000 --> 24:59.000]  So I thought that we should play this Bill Gates clip from two years ago of him on national television promoting death panels that Ezekiel Emanuel, who wrote most of the bill,
[24:59.000 --> 25:04.000]  promotes and that Newsweek promotes in the cover story, The Case for Killing Granny.
[25:04.000 --> 25:09.000]  So the death panels are in the bill. It's going nationwide, not just in the VA.
[25:09.000 --> 25:14.000]  And they want to play this game of telling you it doesn't exist. Kind of like the drone program doesn't exist.
[25:14.000 --> 25:23.000]  Remember, when Gibbs was told to say it didn't exist, a decade after it was public, it's like saying the Eiffel Tower doesn't exist.
[25:23.000 --> 25:31.000]  This is what they think of you. Remember, they're not liberals. They're ultra-fascist liars who know what they're doing.
[25:31.000 --> 25:38.000]  Michael Moore has six armed bodyguards. I've seen them. I videotaped them. He admits he has them. He doesn't want you to have a gun.
[25:38.000 --> 25:53.000]  He says you're a white racist if you have one. But he's a disgusting tyrant who has bodyguards, just like Dianne Feinstein, just like Chuck E. Schumer, just like Obama.
[25:53.000 --> 25:56.000]  Let's go to Bill Gates. Here's the clip.
[25:56.000 --> 26:08.000]  That's a trade-off society's making because of very, very high medical costs. And a lack of willingness to say, you know, is spending a million dollars on that last three months of life for that patient,
[26:08.000 --> 26:16.000]  would it be better not to lay off those 10 teachers and to make that trade-off in medical costs?
[26:16.000 --> 26:20.000]  But that's called the death panel. And you're not supposed to have that discussion.
[26:20.000 --> 26:32.000]  So you, of course, that's an interesting thing you just said, which is just the last three months in life for one person or something because we haven't had a discussion of how to allocate that money.
[26:32.000 --> 26:35.000]  It means we lay off three teachers to do so.
[26:35.000 --> 26:37.000]  I mean, in other words...
[26:37.000 --> 26:47.000]  Let's stop right there. And the reason I play that clip up front is we have the clips in the article by Paul Watson for the Journal of Pediatrics, Bioethics, saying kill babies up to age three.
[26:47.000 --> 26:52.000]  They're not humans. Kill old people. We have all the different quotes. This is what they're pushing.
[26:52.000 --> 27:03.000]  So you can understand the audio that we have of the VA supervisor who's senior at a major East Coast base. I'm going to leave it at that.
[27:03.000 --> 27:09.000]  He was told by another administrator that older veterans should be shot in the head to save money.
[27:09.000 --> 27:14.000]  And we're talking to this guy right now about just going completely public.
[27:14.000 --> 27:24.000]  Supervisors said older veterans should be taken outside and shot in the head to save money.
[27:24.000 --> 27:28.000]  There you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[27:28.000 --> 27:37.000]  And so I want to go to the audio of that.
[27:37.000 --> 27:42.000]  And the full 15-minute interview is up on infowars.com. Here it is.
[27:42.000 --> 27:50.000]  You have supervisors in supervisory positions in this hospital that have been made statements.
[27:50.000 --> 28:01.000]  Racial slurs against veterans have made statements that, you know, older veterans, they should just be taken outside and shot in the head because they're worthless.
[28:01.000 --> 28:07.000]  And this person still works there. And he's still a supervisor.
[28:07.000 --> 28:17.000]  There you go, ladies and gentlemen. So this is an exclusive breaking news up at infowars.com dealing with this.
[28:17.000 --> 28:25.000]  And then meanwhile, we have the incredible denials of people like Carney saying that he first learned of it from the media. Here's that clip.
[28:25.000 --> 28:34.000]  And just to follow up on that. When was the president first made aware of these problems, of these fraudulent lists that were being kept to hide the wait times?
[28:34.000 --> 28:41.000]  When was he first made aware of those problems? And when did other white-ass officials, top white-ass officials, become aware of these problems?
[28:41.000 --> 28:51.000]  When you say these problems, the fact that there have been bureaucrats at some time, the specific allegations that I think were reported first by your network out of Phoenix,
[28:51.000 --> 28:59.000]  I believe we learned about them through the reports. I will double-check if that's not the case, but that's when we learned about them.
[28:59.000 --> 29:07.000]  And that's when, as I understand it, Secretary Shinseki learned about them and immediately took the action that he has taken, including instigating his own review,
[29:07.000 --> 29:13.000]  or initiating his own review, but also requesting that the Inspector General investigate.
[29:13.000 --> 29:18.000]  And I think, again, I would point you to his testimony as well as the Inspector General's testimony last week.
[29:18.000 --> 29:27.000]  And by the way, Obama is now standing behind General Shinseki, who heads up the VA saying, you know, that we're going to up our game and try to make a little better.
[29:27.000 --> 29:33.000]  I want to explain something here. We're going to come back and document this. This is being done by design.
[29:33.000 --> 29:43.000]  This is being done on purpose, on record, to get rid of the veterans. It's called eugenics. It's called population control.
[29:43.000 --> 29:59.000]  We're going to break it down straight ahead.
[29:59.000 --> 30:15.000]  I don't know what it is. Ralph just won't pay any attention to me. When he comes home from work, all he ever does is play video games and go to sleep. It's like I don't even exist.
[30:15.000 --> 30:31.000]  We're going to break it down straight ahead.
[30:31.000 --> 30:59.000]  We're going to break it down straight ahead.
[30:59.000 --> 31:06.000]  In the near future. When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[31:06.000 --> 31:13.000]  Security alert. This is Homeland Security. Analysis, Info Wars, building independent media operations.
[31:13.000 --> 31:18.000]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[31:18.000 --> 31:21.000]  Prime Directive, discredit Alex Jones.
[31:21.000 --> 31:24.000]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theory.
[31:24.000 --> 31:27.000]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called Info Wars.
[31:27.000 --> 31:31.000]  I don't know what he is, except a conspiracy theory.
[31:31.000 --> 31:34.000]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[31:34.000 --> 31:40.000]  They are never going to stop. They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[31:40.000 --> 31:47.000]  Block free iPhone app at infowars.com. Block free podcast and video feed.
[31:47.000 --> 31:50.000]  Imperatives, destroy criminal planet TV.
[31:50.000 --> 31:59.000]  You got a censor eye on the enemy, not worried about what propaganda they put out, intellectually it's begun. You can fail it.
[31:59.000 --> 32:03.000]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[32:03.000 --> 32:07.000]  This year alone over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[32:07.000 --> 32:11.000]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[32:11.000 --> 32:14.000]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[32:14.000 --> 32:21.000]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[32:21.000 --> 32:25.000]  On average the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[32:25.000 --> 32:30.000]  Few filters cut out the glyphosates that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[32:30.000 --> 32:36.000]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosalic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[32:36.000 --> 32:40.000]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[32:40.000 --> 32:44.000]  It is our responsibility to protect our families. The establishment is not going to do it.
[32:44.000 --> 32:47.000]  It's time to take action. It's time to filter our water.

[32:59.000 --> 33:06.000]  Hello, this is Hank Hill, and I'm telling you what, you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[33:06.000 --> 33:11.000]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, infowarsthore.com, yeah.
[33:11.000 --> 33:36.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[33:36.000 --> 33:42.000]  By the way, if you're a VA whistleblower or any other type of government whistleblower,
[33:42.000 --> 33:46.000]  or a listener, it's got news tips for us.
[33:46.000 --> 33:51.000]  We break national news stories every week here, global news stories every week.
[33:51.000 --> 33:56.000]  Send your tips to showtipsatinfowars.com.
[33:56.000 --> 33:59.000]  If you want us to use your identity, say that in the email.
[33:59.000 --> 34:05.000]  If you don't want it used, tell us in the email, we'll protect your identity.
[34:05.000 --> 34:09.000]  Send any provisos you've got.
[34:09.000 --> 34:14.000]  But Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs has been going through his email,
[34:14.000 --> 34:24.000]  and he's back there right now in the news studio recording interviews on video Skype with more whistleblowers.
[34:24.000 --> 34:29.000]  And I'll just tell you a point blank, he's already been down at the Austin VA getting enrolled himself.
[34:29.000 --> 34:32.000]  He's got a lot of combat injuries.
[34:32.000 --> 34:36.000]  And they still need treatment.
[34:36.000 --> 34:42.000]  And they spelled his name wrong and wouldn't give him care for internal bleeding for over a month.
[34:42.000 --> 34:45.000]  They said in July he can come see him, that's all on tape.
[34:45.000 --> 34:52.000]  And he has the police throwing him out of the parking lot on video just on Monday.
[34:52.000 --> 34:55.000]  We just got so much footage, we got to get around to putting it on air.
[34:55.000 --> 34:59.000]  And saying, well, because of the scandal, you can't interview veterans out here.
[34:59.000 --> 35:03.000]  What he does is he goes in, he talks to veterans inside, free speech,
[35:03.000 --> 35:06.000]  and he says, well, come outside, here's my card, I'll interview you.
[35:06.000 --> 35:08.000]  And they don't want that going on.
[35:08.000 --> 35:10.000]  Well, you're not going to stop everybody.
[35:10.000 --> 35:12.000]  Everybody, just shoot a YouTube interview on your iPhone.
[35:12.000 --> 35:14.000]  Upload it, put it to YouTube.
[35:14.000 --> 35:19.000]  All of you can do this.
[35:19.000 --> 35:24.000]  And I like Staff Sergeant Biggs because, you know, he gets it.
[35:24.000 --> 35:30.000]  He served multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan and had Michael Hastings embedded with him
[35:30.000 --> 35:35.000]  from Esquire Magazine and some big battles.
[35:35.000 --> 35:38.000]  And so those got written up in major stories.
[35:38.000 --> 35:42.000]  And then Biggs, of course, we got to knowing Biggs whenever they murdered Michael Hastings,
[35:42.000 --> 35:46.000]  blew his car up when he was on the run from the Feds.
[35:46.000 --> 35:50.000]  And the Feds threatened the family and stuff and told him not to go to the press.
[35:50.000 --> 35:57.000]  And then we got threatened, we were sending reporters out to California, we still did it.
[35:57.000 --> 36:01.000]  And so that's the kind of reporter I want is somebody that's not a coward,
[36:01.000 --> 36:04.000]  because all the rest of his friends and family were intimidated.
[36:04.000 --> 36:11.000]  So you can also send your veterans tips to JBigsandinfowars.com, just the initial J,
[36:11.000 --> 36:19.000]  as in jumping jack, JBigsandinfowars.com.
[36:19.000 --> 36:24.000]  JBigsandinfowars.com.
[36:24.000 --> 36:26.000]  Yeah, there's two Gs.
[36:26.000 --> 36:32.000]  Yeah, I don't know why we always do things like, like, you know, D night or whatever.
[36:32.000 --> 36:35.000]  It just ought to be night or it ought to be, you know what I mean?
[36:35.000 --> 36:38.000]  Just like the simplest emails possible.
[36:38.000 --> 36:39.000]  I'm not complaining.
[36:39.000 --> 36:47.000]  I'm just always saying simple emails and it's like, it ought to be like veteransandinfowars.com.
[36:47.000 --> 36:54.000]  In fact, we'll create that email right now and then that's something that he can check or vets at Infowars.
[36:54.000 --> 36:55.000]  Vets at Infowars.
[36:55.000 --> 36:57.000]  We'll set up vets at Infowars right now.
[36:57.000 --> 37:01.000]  And that can be something everybody checks because there's no way Joe can handle all this.
[37:01.000 --> 37:04.000]  None of us can handle all this.
[37:04.000 --> 37:09.000]  There are just too many whistleblowers coming in, which is a good thing.
[37:09.000 --> 37:12.000]  But that's why I say you should do your own YouTube.
[37:12.000 --> 37:16.000]  And by the way, I tell these whistleblowers, why not just go public?
[37:16.000 --> 37:18.000]  It's the fear of losing the pension.
[37:18.000 --> 37:27.000]  It's the fear of repercussions that has allowed this tyranny to grow and grow and grow and grow and grow.
[37:27.000 --> 37:40.000]  Because everyone's afraid of being persecuted or prosecuted or retaliated against for exposing corruption to the point where people won't report on any type of corruption.
[37:40.000 --> 37:46.000]  But what is politically correct is to ban dodgeball and ban any type of fiesta parties at colleges or high schools.
[37:46.000 --> 38:00.000]  Oh, sorry, you can't have a fiesta party in your health class, in your home class, because tacos are racist.
[38:00.000 --> 38:02.000]  And again, it's meant to make it crazy.
[38:02.000 --> 38:11.000]  Oh, you drew a picture of a gun or you wrote about guns in your fiction essay, you're going to be arrested and give a psychological evaluation.
[38:11.000 --> 38:24.000]  Even though you wrote an article about your dad who's a Marine Corps captain and told a story about the firearms the Marines use, people are actually the SWAT teams are called folks.
[38:24.000 --> 38:35.000]  Again, you can't have valor Victorians, you can't have honors balls to honor people that did well in school and who kept their nose clean.
[38:35.000 --> 38:37.000]  Because that's discriminatory.
[38:37.000 --> 38:48.000]  Everything is discriminatory, ladies and gentlemen, except Obama, 50 million, 100 million, sometimes on his trips, that's all acceptable.
[38:48.000 --> 38:57.000]  That's all a good thing, red carpets, all the rest of it, arresting all the homeless people in Eastern European and African and Latin American cities when he lands.
[38:57.000 --> 38:59.000]  So it looks good when he's there.
[38:59.000 --> 39:18.000]  He tells Africans you can't have a car. You can't have air conditioning, because it hurts the earth, but I'm going to land in Air Force One.
[39:18.000 --> 39:31.000]  Look at this headline just out. Rabbi Little League coach, law officers among 70 arrested in online child porn ring.
[39:31.000 --> 39:40.000]  And you know, when I see these type of headlines, I ask myself, is this a group of people that were good and are being set up?
[39:40.000 --> 39:49.000]  Or is it a group of people that were bad, who didn't play ball or being set up, or is it real?
[39:49.000 --> 40:01.000]  During the course of the investigation, nearly 600 desktop and laptop computer tablets, smart phones and other devices containing a total of 175 terabytes of storage data were seized.
[40:01.000 --> 40:10.000]  Agents are still examining the devices to locate and catalog evidence and arduous tests that could result in more arrest.
[40:10.000 --> 40:20.000]  The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children will also use its analysts to review the images to see whether it can identify children using databases of known victims.
[40:20.000 --> 40:24.000]  This is out of New York, ladies and gentlemen.
[40:24.000 --> 40:28.000]  NBC, New York reporting on that.
[40:28.000 --> 40:33.000]  You know, there are a lot of good people in the police, even in the FBI, that do go after real child exploiters.
[40:33.000 --> 40:36.000]  But they never talk about Dincor.
[40:36.000 --> 40:49.000]  They never talk about the big globalist groups, the UN, trafficking and openly taking children by CPS, or how Dincor under its new name is the biggest private CPS contractor in the United States.
[40:49.000 --> 41:01.000]  That's a telltale sign that they're always busting Homeland Security deputy directors flying to cities to meet with small children and rock and roll people trying to meet with, you know, little kids or whatever.
[41:01.000 --> 41:09.000]  But they're never allowed to go after the top of the food chain.
[41:09.000 --> 41:21.000]  Just thought I'd mention that, you know, while we're worried about taco bars being racist or petting zoos being racist or somebody wanting to bring a camel to the school as a hump day joke.
[41:21.000 --> 41:33.000]  I mean, in the whole world of trendiness, that's what's done is quirky things, funny things, you know, show up to your wedding and a Godzilla outfit.
[41:33.000 --> 41:39.000]  And I kind of get that area of trendiness, practical jokes, doing goofy things.
[41:39.000 --> 41:48.000]  I privately do stuff like that around the office when I have time and with friends and family.
[41:48.000 --> 41:58.000]  It's fun. It's what makes life fun. It has nothing to do with putting down Arabs for a college fraternity to get a camel at its party.
[41:58.000 --> 42:03.000]  That's how you make a party fun.
[42:03.000 --> 42:08.000]  And I guess the rest of the politically correct people out there don't understand how to have fun.
[42:08.000 --> 42:16.000]  No, no, they actually do. They want to dictate to you what's acceptable and they want you to look to them as the authority of what is acceptable.
[42:16.000 --> 42:22.000]  And the answer to all this political correctness is to say, you're a distraction to make us all guilty of something.
[42:22.000 --> 42:31.000]  We will be guilt tripped into going along with your anti-gun, anti-family globalist agenda.
[42:31.000 --> 42:40.000]  And so you can have the moral high ground while you warehouse the veterans to die, kill the old people, forced abortions and fantasize.
[42:40.000 --> 42:49.000]  Rob us with foreign banks, trillions of dollars every few months, wreck our whole future, engage in genetic engineering of the whole planet.
[42:49.000 --> 43:01.000]  While you're overthrowing creation itself, you want to distract us and make words criminal and reduce the language down to nothing because everyone's afraid to communicate because they'll be called politically incorrect.
[43:01.000 --> 43:06.000]  Who cares what you psychological authoritarians have to say?
[43:06.000 --> 43:13.000]  It's important to be politically incorrect just to show them they're not the boss.
[43:13.000 --> 43:28.000]  Because as you go along with political correctness, they're going to make it more and more ridiculous on purpose to make the area of accepted political activity smaller and smaller.
[43:28.000 --> 43:39.000]  I went to work out this morning at a gym with my personal trainer and I was standing up at the front about to leave.
[43:39.000 --> 43:53.000]  And he was telling me, you know, be sure and do this, be sure and do that, be sure, you know, juice and the guy behind the counter goes, hey, Pat, did you hear hump days now racist?
[43:53.000 --> 43:58.000]  And Pat had heard about it and he goes, yeah, yeah, you're not allowed to have petting zoos or camels.
[43:58.000 --> 44:08.000]  And these women got mad at us and were shaking their heads and were upset whispering they shouldn't be talking like that.
[44:08.000 --> 44:26.000]  So just us talking about the insanity of the politically correct anti-free speech religion was a abomination desolation.
[44:26.000 --> 44:36.000]  And I told you, I've seen people go, hey, Martin Springs, hey, let's look at Chinese food and everybody goes, whoa, whoa, whoa, dude, don't be racist.
[44:36.000 --> 44:46.000]  Communication is now racist to say, oh, yeah, you know, black folks, oh, that's racist.
[44:46.000 --> 44:52.000]  Say African American is racist to say Anglo is racist.
[44:52.000 --> 44:58.000]  Everything just be totally obsessed, totally freaked out, totally on eggshells where you don't say or do anything.
[44:58.000 --> 45:06.000]  Well, meanwhile, these are nothing but cultural Marxist ruling over us, laughing at us, saying you don't like, you know, turning your guns in your racist.
[45:06.000 --> 45:11.000]  You don't like Obamacare, you're racist, where you're so scared of being called racist, you'll do whatever they say.
[45:11.000 --> 45:23.000]  You people have no power, you're a joke. People need to realize that you have no power.
[45:23.000 --> 45:32.000]  It is so incredibly frustrating to see these people consciously doing this.
[45:32.000 --> 45:49.000]  Yes, it sounds crazy and over the top to someone that's 50 years old or 35 years old or 40 years old or 60 years old to say that if you have a fiesta party for a fundraiser for your fraternity,
[45:49.000 --> 45:54.000]  and you have enchiladas and tacos, that it's racist.
[45:54.000 --> 46:01.000]  But for people that are young, they go, okay, we won't have toga parties. Okay, that's racist against Greeks.
[46:01.000 --> 46:08.000]  And okay, we won't have the taco parties.
[46:08.000 --> 46:16.000]  And then remember earlier this year in Colorado and several other states, they said, don't have costume parties.
[46:16.000 --> 46:30.000]  Last October as well during Halloween, where you have stereotypes of a cowboy, of a bandito, of a geisha girl, of a Native American, that's racist.
[46:30.000 --> 46:35.000]  No, it's not. It's fun. It's fun to dress up like a Native American.
[46:35.000 --> 46:41.000]  And you don't mean any disrespect to Native Americans to dress up like a Native American.
[46:41.000 --> 46:48.000]  The girls love to do that. Little Pocahontas outfits. And then you dress up like a cowboy or vice versa.
[46:48.000 --> 46:53.000]  This is really meant to be mind control, ladies and gentlemen.
[46:53.000 --> 47:00.000]  And it's about making people feel bad because they know the average young person is the opposite of racist.
[47:00.000 --> 47:03.000]  So they've got to be taught now that there's something new to be guilty about.
[47:03.000 --> 47:11.000]  And I know most of you know that, folks, but we've got veterans being warehoused and not given healthcare.
[47:11.000 --> 47:18.000]  And we've got people like Bill Press saying the VA scandal is just another Republican party conspiracy theory.
[47:18.000 --> 47:29.000]  I want to play that clip in a moment. And Jay Carney saying he just heard about it while Bill Gates says, hey, kill an old lady, hire three teachers.
[47:29.000 --> 47:34.000]  This is a culture of death. They are destroying our future. They are annihilating our industry.
[47:34.000 --> 47:42.000]  We're being shut down and they've got us worried about taco bars and that there's honors night for an honors dinner
[47:42.000 --> 47:50.000]  with the teachers and the principals to hang out with the young adults that are about to graduate
[47:50.000 --> 47:57.000]  who have A pluses and who've shown they want to succeed at life and they want to go meet with teachers and the principals.
[47:57.000 --> 48:01.000]  They want to show their part of society. They want to learn to go to business meetings.
[48:01.000 --> 48:08.000]  That's how you learn to dress nice and go to the meetings and go to the valovictorian meetings and go to the honors meetings.
[48:08.000 --> 48:12.000]  And that's where you go. Hey, where are you thinking about going to college? Well, that's where I went.
[48:12.000 --> 48:19.000]  You ought to come by the corporate offices of the law firm downtown and we'll get you to know the people
[48:19.000 --> 48:24.000]  so that as soon as you get ready to go to law school in four years, I think we may have a place for you.
[48:24.000 --> 48:29.000]  That's how you go meet people because it's not just about your grades.
[48:29.000 --> 48:33.000]  It's about you sit there at the banquet and are charming and talk to people.
[48:33.000 --> 48:44.000]  These are life skills and the system doesn't want you to have those life skills on the golf course or having cocktails.
[48:44.000 --> 48:50.000]  I'm telling you where business is done. It's done at the gym. It's done over cocktails.
[48:50.000 --> 48:54.000]  It's done at the country club. It's done at the corporate meetings.
[48:54.000 --> 48:58.000]  That's where you get jobs. That's where you succeed in life.
[48:58.000 --> 49:06.000]  And they're saying, oh, we didn't do good in school. We don't like the fact that you're going to go to a honors ball.
[49:06.000 --> 49:13.000]  This is an attack on reality, ladies and gentlemen.
[49:13.000 --> 49:17.000]  The globalists don't want men to be warriors. They don't want women to be women.
[49:17.000 --> 49:24.000]  They want you to be dumb, helpless jellyfish that go and enroll in government welfare.
[49:24.000 --> 49:32.000]  Just like the Democratic representative came out and said, communism has worked under Obama.
[49:32.000 --> 49:36.000]  Yeah, it's worked in butchering this country. Let's go out to break with Bill Press.
[49:36.000 --> 49:43.000]  Here's Bill Press. It's a conspiracy theory to admit that the veterans are on death list and committing suicide in record numbers.
[49:43.000 --> 49:49.000]  Here it is. Let's remember, Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act is the law of the land.
[49:49.000 --> 49:54.000]  And the people who are ignoring the law are the governors who won't put Medicaid in their states,
[49:54.000 --> 50:01.000]  or these House Republicans who tried to repeal it 54 times. This is just another lie.
[50:01.000 --> 50:04.000]  But you know, on the conspiracies, you're right. They went after Obamacare.
[50:04.000 --> 50:08.000]  They were going to run on that this year. That ran out of gas because it's doing so well.
[50:08.000 --> 50:13.000]  So now they've turned to Benghazi. This is soon going to run out of gas. What's next? The VA.
[50:13.000 --> 50:15.000]  I'll bet you that's what they're going to run on next.
[50:15.000 --> 50:20.000]  Well, they're trying to make the VA. Its conspiracy is fear-mongering.
[50:20.000 --> 50:26.000]  I want to explain something. We told you about the death panels.
[50:26.000 --> 50:29.000]  They admit the death panels, the rationing of care where they charge you more for less.
[50:29.000 --> 50:37.000]  It's what they do in Europe. It's what they do in Canada. Brock Lesnar of the UFC couldn't even get surgery in Canada, folks.
[50:37.000 --> 50:43.000]  Remember that? I mean, I know people in Canada. Oh, Watson had strep throat a few years ago.
[50:43.000 --> 50:48.000]  Almost died. He couldn't get health care, and they wouldn't let him go to a private doctor even though he had the money.
[50:48.000 --> 50:53.000]  And he finally threw fits and got the care he needed.
[50:53.000 --> 51:08.000]  I mean, they say there's no $5,000 fine. Of course there is. It's in the stinking bill.
[51:24.000 --> 51:30.000]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[51:30.000 --> 51:33.000]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[51:33.000 --> 51:38.000]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from my Patreon supply.

[51:59.000 --> 52:06.000]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even if I had a pretty good-sized meal that I was still starving.
[52:06.000 --> 52:14.000]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world
[52:14.000 --> 52:24.000]  are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[52:24.000 --> 52:30.000]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity.
[52:30.000 --> 52:38.000]  The Young Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.

[53:55.000 --> 54:21.000]  That's harvestright.com.
[54:21.000 --> 54:28.000]  That is a senior individual at a major East Coast facility.
[54:28.000 --> 54:33.000]  And we're working on whether or not the Harvest Right freeze-dryer works or not.
[54:33.000 --> 54:41.000]  And we're working on whether or not the Harvest Right freeze-dryer works or not.
[54:41.000 --> 54:51.000]  That is a senior individual at a major East Coast facility.
[54:51.000 --> 54:56.000]  And we're working on whether we can just say where the facility is, but obviously the voice is easy to recognize.
[54:56.000 --> 55:06.000]  So we should play that by ear with these other big whistleblowers and maybe just do transcripts so we can then say where they work.
[55:06.000 --> 55:11.000]  And that's then what draws the attention to it, but it's one of the biggest VA hospitals on the East Coast.
[55:11.000 --> 55:18.000]  And it's a 15-minute interview. I mean, it is just warehousing them and not giving them treatment and just waiting for them to die.
[55:18.000 --> 55:27.000]  And that's what we've now learned about Austin, what we've learned about Phoenix, and it is the policy to not give these people treatment.
[55:27.000 --> 55:31.000]  I remember it was 15 years ago or so. We started learning it was in Kansas City.
[55:31.000 --> 55:42.000]  They'd strap down the old vets from World War II Korea and flies would actually go up their nose and lay eggs in the sinus and maggots would eat their brain.
[55:42.000 --> 55:50.000]  And then I guess it turns into a VA joke because it turned out there were cases in Washington State, Texas, you name it after that,
[55:50.000 --> 55:57.000]  where the only deaths from maggots in this country tend to be at VA hospitals and some nursing homes.
[55:57.000 --> 56:02.000]  And look, they don't have insurance to pump. They just want more.
[56:02.000 --> 56:08.000]  That's the attitude of we'll get raises and have more money if we didn't have to take care of these old people.
[56:08.000 --> 56:19.000]  And you go to the VA facilities now, according to the vets that work here, and they have these special cops there, these mercenary types that get in your face, boss you around.
[56:19.000 --> 56:21.000]  They treat them really bad.
[56:21.000 --> 56:27.000]  And my dad always talked about doing volunteer work in the VA hospital, how nightmarish it was.
[56:27.000 --> 56:37.000]  And some are better than others, but Biggs went in, like I said, Monday to get signed up here. He lives here now.
[56:37.000 --> 56:39.000]  And they got his name wrong.
[56:39.000 --> 56:46.000]  First, they said, well, you can come for your internal bleeding in July because he was in a one IED,
[56:46.000 --> 56:51.000]  that special forces dug him out of where it blew up the armored vehicle and burned up inside.
[56:51.000 --> 56:56.000]  And he breathed all the fumes and smoke and fire, and it burned his lungs and esophagus.
[56:56.000 --> 56:59.000]  So he coughs up blood all the time. I've seen him do it.
[56:59.000 --> 57:02.000]  And he's bleeding real bad right now.
[57:02.000 --> 57:09.000]  And he went in there and he just has blood leaking into his stomach down into his lungs.
[57:09.000 --> 57:14.000]  And they just told him, you know, you can come in July when we're able to do something.
[57:14.000 --> 57:20.000]  And then they said, sorry, it's going to be longer because they've misspelled his name on the computer.
[57:20.000 --> 57:25.000]  And he just said, so what do I do? And they just said, well, hopefully you won't die.
[57:25.000 --> 57:34.000]  And he'd be on air right now talking about it, but he's in there taping interviews on Skype with more whistleblowers right now.
[57:34.000 --> 57:36.000]  And so that's that's how it works.
[57:36.000 --> 57:45.000]  He tells the story about one time he was being flown out of Romstein back to the U.S. in his bloody uniform,
[57:45.000 --> 57:47.000]  because they put it back on him at the hospital.
[57:47.000 --> 57:50.000]  That's that's the type of care they get. They didn't get him.
[57:50.000 --> 57:53.000]  He was flown out, medevacked out of Afghanistan to Germany.
[57:53.000 --> 58:05.000]  So they dressed him back up in his combat uniform with shrapnel holes in the chest and legs and blood all over it and dirt and other things.
[58:05.000 --> 58:17.000]  And he's going through when he gets to the U.S., the TSA pulls him out and yells at him for an hour and a half saying, why are we picking up explosives?
[58:17.000 --> 58:20.000]  And they keep and they were trying to cut open his cast sticking probes in.
[58:20.000 --> 58:25.000]  He was saying, look, I got blown up by shrapnel from a mortar.
[58:25.000 --> 58:28.000]  Here's my paperwork. He had IVs hooked in him, everything.

[59:52.000 --> 01:00:04.000]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCM radio network.
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:11.000]  Big brother mainstream media government cover ups you want answers.
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:29.000]  So does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCM radio network and now live from Austin, Texas. Alex Jones.
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:42.000]  He's an extremely arrogant scum that runs this country and sucks off all of us absolutely hates men and they hate veterans more than ever because cowards hate people that are not cowards.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:52.000]  And you see Obama defending the VA scandal in general senseki but saying don't worry we're going to up our game. Yes exterminating your enemy.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:01:03.000]  This is their number one enemy. The illegals can get free health care and their babies born for free but veterans can't and the VA scandal is building on itself right now.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:13.000]  There's another report up at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com Miami VA whistleblower exposes drug dealing theft and abuse.
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:22.000]  Yeah more than anything it's just a culture of criminal activity in government facilities or they're just above the law and do whatever they want.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:28.000]  So we're going to be breaking all of that down as well today.
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.000]  There's another report that just broke up at info wars dot com.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:35.000]  Is there a GMO chemtrail connection.
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:46.000]  This drop could possibly be engineered to withstand the effects of increased heavy metals in the soil. John Rappaport earns out Monsanto and others are working on it.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:52.000]  That's up at info wars dot com.
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:02:01.000]  Also how central banks are waging war on your savings achieving economic recovery and growth requires first knowing what caused the problem in the first place.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:10.000]  And that's why the economy just continues to get worse because it's a consolidation of the economy that we're facing as a society.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:19.000]  Also I want to get to the audio and the video of this man claims Albuquerque police caused him to lose a testicle.
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:24.000]  Officers claim they only fought him to protect themselves.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:31.000]  I'll tell you the Albuquerque police I'm almost scared to drive through Albuquerque we see more scandals and more shootings and.
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:39.000]  They know they shoot this homeless guy in the back who isn't even armed and then go boo yah when they kill him and then just keep shooting him.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:47.000]  And like get all excited and let the dog bite him for a couple minutes and are obviously having some kind of weird hunting thrill.
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:53.000]  So that's up on info wars dot com.
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.000]  We're going to be breaking all of that down.
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:03.000]  And again I mentioned this earlier I want to play this clip again right now Democratic congressman we've proved that communism works.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:08.000]  If you get everybody a government job there's no crime he claimed.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:18.000]  There's no crime I mean the areas that are more socialist or communist like Chicago New York and DC have the highest crime.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:26.000]  But again if everybody works for the government or a government contract only select corporations that get the contracts will be able to operate.
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:35.000]  Democratic Florida representative Joe Garcia fresh off being caught eating his own earwax on camera was caught red handed in another gas this week.
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:42.000]  I mean that low crime rates in border cities with lots of federal immigration workers has proved that communism works.
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.000]  They always claim El Paso is low crime that's pure bull.
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:52.000]  Let's go ahead and play a club of that we've proved that communism works if you give everybody a good government job there's no crime.
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:58.000]  But that isn't what we should be doing on the border the account of money that we've poured into there and we're having a diminishing return.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:08.000]  So while we're doing we're spending all this money here we have border problems in in Puerto Rico where we haven't been able to set up a system that's safe there and we're fine.
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:17.000]  People are finding out the third world is collapsing representative the third world is collapsing right now.
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:22.000]  That's why there's a thousand at a FEMA camp down in San Antonio we're going to send reporters down there.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:33.000]  That's why there is a thousand youth not even really from Mexico they're from Nicaragua El Salvador Guatemala that have made it all the way up through Mexico.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:39.000]  Talking about harrowing tail trying to get here the world is melting down because of globalism.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:51.000]  The world is going into artificial scarcity crises and some of these third world countries don't have industries and are collapsing.
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:59.000]  We're going to be right back ladies and gentlemen the special guest is going to break down the incredible hubris of the system and is the world coming to a breaking point.
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:09.000]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day but it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:19.000]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:31.000]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:41.000]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:52.000]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the U.S.A. the new Info Wars Life Lung Cleans is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.

[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:05.000]  General what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential for food situation?
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:09.000]  The police are shoving people shoving Alex shoving the crowd.
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:17.000]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:23.000]  Is this another false flight stage attack to take our civil liberties and promote homeland security by sticking our hands down our pants on the streets?
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:30.000]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere and that's what prisonplanet.tv is designed to do.
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:38.000]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so called rebels.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:42.000]  What we see now is a war against reality, it's a war against the truth.
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:51.000]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of prisonplanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:02.000]  I don't know what it is, Ralph just won't pay any attention to me.
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:07.000]  When he comes home from work all he ever does is play video games and go to sleep, just like I don't even exist.
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000]  Oh Betty, that's just awful.
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:13.000]  Does this seem familiar? If the answer to this question is yes, then listen carefully.
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:24.000]  Toxic pesticides, GMO foods and additives, BPA plastics, contaminated water supplies, many of these toxic additives are deliberately engineered to attack and weaken human masculinity.
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.000]  It's part of the eugenics population control movement, look it up.
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:34.000]  If men are more interested in online gaming than they are in their wives, a serious population crisis is soon to follow.

[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:08.000]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:12.000]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:35.000]  We're joined for the balance of the hour by a talk show host who I've been a frequent guest on his show, I don't know, five, six times over the last year or two.
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:42.000]  And I'm always impressed listening to it, how informed they are and how eloquent he and his co-host are.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:50.000]  In fact, I've even said that, you know, sometimes when David Knight can't fill in that he and his co-host would be good to host this show.
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:53.000]  They're that informed on how the world really works.
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:58.000]  I'd call them real libertarian constitutionalists, but Mike Howard's the main host.
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:02.000]  And I wanted to get him on to talk about the state of the world and where he thinks things are going.
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:15.000]  And to talk about the hubris of the ruling establishment, all these cycles coming together, all the corruption, the over-the-top arrogance of saying, there's no drone program.
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:18.000]  If you've got a business, you didn't build it.
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:21.000]  Raising the debt ceiling doesn't raise the debt ceiling.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:24.000]  We're not coming after your guns, even though we are.
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:37.000]  If you don't like Obama Carrier Racist, Benghazi, the VA, with Al Sharpton and Press and others saying it doesn't exist, there is no problem.
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.000]  The VA's had big problems and been hellish for a long time.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:43.000]  Now it's outright evil.
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:53.000]  And we've got whistleblowers at the Austin VA, I'll just tell you right now, people that work there and at other facilities that say, no, these people are committing suicide.
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:56.000]  And we're trying to get ahold of some of the dead vets' families.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:03.000]  But, I mean, they've got stuff like bullet fragments in their spines and things, and they can't get health care.
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:06.000]  Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs, I mean, he'll talk about it on air.
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:13.000]  He's been really down when he was in North Carolina because of all his injuries, and the fact that they can't give him treatment or getting better.
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:20.000]  He's got shrapnel all over his body, bullet holes, burned lungs, from being inside a burning armored vehicle in Afghanistan.
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:23.000]  Was that in Iraq? I think that was Baghdad.
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:27.000]  The point is, we'll get him in here soon. He's just busy doing all these whistleblower interviews right now.
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:34.000]  And he went into the VA and was there yesterday and Monday all day, basically.
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000]  And they spelled his name wrong.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.000]  They tell him, well, oh, sorry, it'll be longer now.
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:45.000]  We thought it'd be July we could send some type of endoscope down your throat.
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:51.000]  And, you know, Biggs will tell you he wakes up, you know, blood all over his bed.
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:56.000]  It's where he has black sheets, blood all over him in the morning, coughs up blood.
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:59.000]  And they're just like, eh, we'll look at you in July.
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:05.000]  And he was a Staff Sergeant in a whole bunch of battles in Afghanistan and Iraq.
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:09.000]  And he can't even get treatment.
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:15.000]  And he's there talking to the vets that are just in so much pain, they're blowing their heads off.
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:23.000]  So we're now learning a lot of the suicide is over the factor in so much pain, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:27.000]  And they won't ever give him surgeries. They just give him pills, pills, pills.
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:33.000]  And actually told him in North Carolina, he threw all his pills away and he said, I don't want pills.
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:41.000]  I want you to see what you can do to fix these ulcers, these burn holes in my esophagus and lungs.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:47.000]  And the issue is he's gone and looked it up. They have treatments, but they won't give those to him.
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:50.000]  Because remember, Obama says, you don't need all these tests.
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:54.000]  You know, you don't need end of life care. Just go die, Biggs.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:12:00.000]  Well, we're not going to just throw Biggs in the gutter. We hired him.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:03.000]  And that's what businesses out there need to do, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:09.000]  If you get a tear in your eye when they see the Star Spangled Banner or you claim you care about the vets,
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:14.000]  they've got wounded warrior programs that I know they give a lot of the money to the vets that have arms and legs blown off.
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:19.000]  But what about all those people that are scared of vets?
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:25.000]  Because the big truth is most of the trendies in people don't want to hire vets, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:39.000]  And it just illustrates how this government will treat foster kids, CPS kids, veterans, anybody that they've got in their clutches.
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.000]  And it's despicable. So we're going to talk about that as well.
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:48.000]  The video and the audio is up on infowars.com. The story needs to go viral.
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:54.000]  VA supervisor on the East Coast. And I just want to add in the article, we have his badge.
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:13:00.000]  We have his name. We went and looked to see that he was in the administration.
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:05.000]  And he has a very distinct voice. He let us, you know, put this out. It'll probably come after him.
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:12.000]  So what? Let him come after everybody. Let everybody blow the whistle. Then you can't go after everyone.
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:21.000]  And it's the standard deal where the other supervisors are saying, you know, we're not going to help these bleepers.
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:28.000]  They're dehumanizing them with racial slurs. They're putting down old people. That's how it always works.
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:34.000]  Oh, you know, nobody wants babies aboard them. Nobody wants old people. Kill them. Nobody wants to take care of black people, blah, blah, blah.
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:43.000]  Tyrants always dehumanize you so they can feel good about what they're doing.
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:49.000]  So we're going to cover the waterfront today. TEPCO releasing record amounts of radiation in the ocean.
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:53.000]  A lot of us picking up pace on executive actions.
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:59.000]  Boehner says that if they continue to do this, they're going to hit a quote brick wall.
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:09.000]  Rand Paul set to engage in his epic filibusters. The sequel to Rand Paul's epic filibuster is happening today.
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:13.000]  We're going to have David Knight and others following that. We're going to be following that here.
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:20.000]  We tend to open the phones up in the third hour if you're a veteran and have had experiences with the VA, the good, the bad, the ugly.
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:26.000]  They were giving the VA a bad rap here. We'll tell us. The truth is, though, they want to deny care.
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:32.000]  They see the veterans as a liability and as an enemy. Look at the DHS saying they're the number one terror threat.
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:40.000]  Look at the police this week, the clips we played on the news saying we need these big armored vehicles because the veterans, the epidemic of veterans is committing crime.
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:45.000]  There is no epidemic. Look at the crime statistics. It's made up.
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:51.000]  But the federal government's gearing up to fight men that know how to fight.
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:59.000]  Alpha males, men that aren't cowards, men that aren't going to be pushed around, men that aren't going to be slaves. They hate you.
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:08.000]  And when they're done with the veterans, who they see as the most manly of the men, they're going to go after everybody else, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.000]  You take down the men, you got the women, you got the children.
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:18.000]  Hitler said, first you get the women, then you've got the children, so follow the men.
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:27.000]  You culturally get the women to follow your political correctness, and then you can take down the men.
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:33.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, you put out a false narrative to the women.
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:45.000]  If you do what the state says and play a ball with an anti-state and treat your men like they're your children and take your nurturing instinct and turn it into a police state instinct, you'll have a great life.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:49.000]  Ladies, you got a great life going down this road?
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:52.000]  You really feeling powered with men emasculated and dominated?
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:56.000]  No, you now got the state coming down on you like a ton of bricks.
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:05.000]  Let's go to Mike Howard of WNFZ 94.3, summer class on 850 a.m. in Knoxville.
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:08.000]  Thank you so much for joining us and coming on, Mike.
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000]  There's so much to talk about.
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:15.000]  What is your take on all the things that are unfolding in this hubris and this breaking point?
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000]  I know you've been talking about.
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:33.000]  I've been sitting here for the past 20 minutes or so listening to you trying not to get too upset before I went on with you, but this latest round with the VA, my dad's a vet.
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:38.000]  My grandfather is a vet.
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:17:03.000]  And to see how vets are treated, to see how we take these incredible men, these heroes, who gave their time, who gave their families, who gave their lives, who gave their limbs, who gave everything they had so that these leaders, quote, unquote, in Washington
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:09.000]  can then turn around and say, great, you're an expendable resource. We're done with you now. Now it's time for you to just go away.
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:18.000]  As long as we can trot you out every Memorial Day and trot you out every Veterans Day and a solo parade and then the rest of the time just stay out of our sight because we don't want to see you.
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:25.000]  In fact, if you just go into a corner somewhere and just disappear, that would be even better for us.
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:37.000]  It is unconscionable. It is absolutely one of the most despicable, one of the most despicable, disgusting things I think we do to any class of people in this country now.
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:41.000]  And the sad fact of the matter, it's not just vets.
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:55.000]  When you look at over the course of six years, 80,000 plus active duty military being subjected to sexual assault, this is how we treat our active duty military.
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:03.000]  This is how we treat the people that go out right now and fight for our freedoms, that fight for these idiots in Washington.
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:13.000]  These are brand new lavish jets and for the first time ever, the troops crap in buckets on the C-130s and everything's rotting with lice crawling or everything.
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:16.000]  I mean, it is a total degeneration of the system.
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:22.000]  It doesn't make any sense in any way, shape or form.
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:29.000]  Thankfully though, I recently got to say, and I have to share this because you've got to find some good somewhere.
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:36.000]  You have to. Otherwise, you go crazy watching this idiocy just go on and on and on.
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:43.000]  A couple weeks ago, my oldest son graduated from the University of Tennessee.
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:47.000]  Very proud of him. It was great to watch the class walk.
[01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:56.000]  At the very end of their graduation ceremony, they brought 10 ROTC members to come in and get their commissioners' officers.
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:07.000]  So we sat there in this crowded arena in downtown Knoxville and watched these 10 soon-to-be officers walk in, march in.
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:16.000]  And the students, the students, the graduates all sitting down there started the applause and they stood to their feet and they applauded them as they walked in.
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:22.000]  You don't have to forgive me because it was a very moving experience. I was standing there with my dad and he had tears in his eyes.
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:37.000]  I had tears in my eyes. And to watch these graduates, these students, leap to their feet and cheer their classmates on who will, you know, within a few months time be overseas serving this country.
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:41.000]  And then again, as they left the same thing, the students stood and started this applause.
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:46.000]  But now will they do something? People that have actually served them and through the fire is the larger issue.
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:54.000]  It illustrates how it's all just so surfaced in the media to appreciate the veterans and the troops, but then do we throw them out like garbage? I agree.
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:20:20.000]  Let's talk about that tipping point, that breaking point. What do you think's coming? Let me get back.

[01:23:53.000 --> 01:24:09.000]  800-513-0029 VaticanCatholic.com
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:50.000]  There's a video up on infowars.com that I've now watched here in the breaks of the police basically bashing a man's testicles in until he lost one of his testicles and they get him out of the car, they arrest him and then they knee him in the testicles until he loses one of his testicles for no reason.
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:58.000]  And the police say, well, he was resisting us and I've watched the video. No, they're just physically attacking him.
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:11.000]  And it's the same department that shoots homeless people in the back and then celebrates and goes, boo-yah! Yeah! And then the guy's dead and they let the dog bite him and just bite on him and shoot. I mean, it's just crazy people.
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:22.000]  And that's what we're talking about, folks, is a system where everybody salutes the ROTC and the rest of it because at a primitive level, these are our warriors, our young men going off the battle.
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:30.000]  We're meant to support that at a very primitive level, but then what happens once they come back?
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:39.000]  Going back to Mike Howard, Mike, you've been talking a lot about this tipping point. Do you think the system is trying to push us into a revolution or do they just not care anymore?
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:48.000]  Oh, no, I think they're trying to push us into some sort of break. I think it's not so much a grand revolution as a fact. It's divide and conquer.
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:54.000]  It's the divide and conquer method. It's take everybody and break them into subsets and break them into groups.
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:26:02.000]  Black versus white, gay versus straight, man versus woman, rich versus poor, young versus old. You can break it down however many ways you want to.
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:13.000]  All you got to do is watch any given nightly newscast, any mainstream media newscast out there and you'll see it's some group versus another group.
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000]  It's some agenda versus another agenda.
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:25.000]  And they're taking all of our basic liberties together. We're all collectively getting screwed, but it's okay because we're being taught to think of problems being caused by someone being different.
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:34.000]  Sure. Absolutely. Because as long as you can keep everybody fighting amongst themselves, then it's easy to keep them focused on everything but what's actually going on.
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:41.000]  While you're doing this over here, while you're fighting and your little skirmishes are going on in your own little camps, then we're going to go ahead and do this over here.
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:46.000]  So by the time you're done, you're going to turn around and go, what happened? When did this happen?
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:50.000]  Where does your God tell you it's all going?
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:57.000]  The scary thing is, being a father, the scary thing is, I think it's going to get worse before it gets any better.
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:12.000]  I think it's getting to a point where people are getting so, they're getting so incensed, they're getting so pushed to the breaking point that they're going to get us to the point where we just give in.
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:23.000]  I think that's it. They're trying to put us into a catatonic state of just so much stimulus, learned helplessness, where we just have Stockholm syndrome basically, and just roll over.
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:32.000]  That is the tactic. That's why they publicly lie and say, there's no one coming for your guns. There's no death panels. There's no $5,000 fine. You didn't build your business.
[01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:36.000]  Raising the debt limit doesn't raise the debt limit, but I don't think it's going to work.
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:50.000]  I hope it's not. The thing that frightens me the most though is that for a large part of the population, you've got people that are so focused on really important things like what so-and-so is doing on what reality show,
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:59.000]  or what team might be going to the Super Bowl this year. That's all great and good, and that's wonderful entertainment, but in the long run, it has nothing to do with anything that actually matters.
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:09.000]  So we're all focused. We are a large portion focused on all these other insignificant things, or fighting these moral battles amongst their little tribes.
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:17.000]  And yet, the few people that stand up, you, myself, a handful of other people that stand up and say, look, this isn't right. There's something wrong here.
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:23.000]  Well, then you're labeled an extremist. You're a conspiracy theorist. You need to break out the tinfoil hats.
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:30.000]  There's something wrong with your rabble rouser. You're just causing problems. You're spreading lies and you're spreading hoaxes.
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:41.000]  Well, that's illustrated by Press and Sharpton last night on MSNBC. They actually said there is no VA story. There is no abuse. There is no death list.
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:46.000]  Even though it's there, they just say it doesn't exist. That can't work forever.
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:54.000]  Apparently, as long as you ignore the problem, it doesn't really exist, right? If I don't acknowledge you, then you're not real.
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:59.000]  So if I don't say there's a problem, then apparently there's no problem, and apparently people buy into that.
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:06.000]  I mean, you look at what happened just to the north of us yesterday. Here you've got Mitch McConnell in this, in what was going to be quoted, the fight for his life,
[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:14.000]  and he just easily walked back in and got his seat back, because apparently after all the complaints, after all the things we heard negative,
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:19.000]  people went, eh, whatever. There's nothing I can do. I'll just stay at home and I won't vote.
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:24.000]  And all he had to do was get a small portion of his base to go out and vote. He gets his seat back.
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:30.000]  Well, look at Boehner, who says he's not going to let Obama act as a dictator, but he's been doing that.
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:35.000]  Let's come back and talk about that Hill headline, Winehouse picking up the pace on executive actions.
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:42.000]  How far will the establishment let Obama and the globalists go, as far as we let them?
[01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:47.000]  All this and a lot more plus Fukushima news coming up straight ahead.
[01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:22.000]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:26.000]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:30.000]  Hue filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:37.000]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosalic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:42.000]  All right, it is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:45.000]  It is our responsibility to protect our families. The establishment's not going to do it.
[01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:48.000]  It's time to take action. It's time to filter our water.

[01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:11.000]  that can be added to both your home cabinet and preparedness pack alike.

[01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:21.000]  The new infowarslife silver bullet colloidal silver is the answer for you and your family.
[01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:26.000]  And it's entirely free of toxic artificial additives that are loaded into many products.
[01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:32.000]  The infowarslife silver bullet silver is so powerful that it is concentrated into a 2-ounce bottle
[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:35.000]  that is not recommended for extended continual use.
[01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000]  This is not a low-grade formula.
[01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:41.000]  We are working with one of the top laboratory manufacturers in the United States
[01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:46.000]  to bring you the best form of colloidal silver using electrical processes
[01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:50.000]  within a base of deionized water for your preparedness storage.

[01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:07.000]  I know that most of you here in this commercial already know about the New World Order, eugenics
[01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000]  and all the other issues covered here at InfoWars.
[01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:12.000]  The question is, do your friends and family know?
[01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000]  If not, then I want to know why.
[01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000]  Oh, I know it's tough to talk about this with some people.
[01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:19.000]  They might call you names or they just want to talk about sports.
[01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:20.000]  They are so poppers.
[01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000]  I say so what?
[01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000]  There's a battle going on out there right now.
[01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:27.000]  The ammunition is information and the soldiers are you.
[01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:31.000]  It's time to transform your game from passive listener to active participant.
[01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:36.000]  We from Scotland have had our skin in this game for the greater part of the last thousand years
[01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:37.000]  and I'm still fighting.
[01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:40.000]  If we don't all stand up right now, we're going to lose everything.
[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000]  The InfoWar is worldwide.
[01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:46.000]  Tell your friends about InfoWars and let them know that InfoWars doesn't print bull.
[01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:50.000]  It's real journalism and news backed up by documented fact.
[01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:55.000]  Step up and take your friends and family to InfoWars.com, prisonplanet.tv
[01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:58.000]  and planetinfowars.com.
[01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:26.000]  The truth will set them free.
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:40.000]  So will Obama turn the executive branch into a dictatorship?
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:43.000]  That doesn't mean Obama will be a dictator and stay in office.
[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:49.000]  It means the executive is becoming a dictatorship along with the bureaucracy
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:53.000]  and Congress is being turned into a ceremonial body completely.
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:56.000]  That's the point we've now reached in this nation.
[01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:57.000]  It's officially happening.
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:01.000]  Historically, people usually don't notice when that's happening and it just unfolds
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:05.000]  and then from there, the prosperity goes out the window.
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:11.000]  Because it is a moral society in my experience and in my research
[01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:17.000]  that actually creates the wealth, creates the success.
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:23.000]  So we're going to be breaking all that down and more here.
[01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:29.000]  Before I go any further, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:38.000]  I want to tell you a little bit about the products that are available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:44.000]  We have really excellent pro-liberty t-shirts like a guy putting a gun to somebody's head
[01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:48.000]  who has a bag of money and then it just says socialism.
[01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:54.000]  We have all the Molan Labe in English and in Greek shirts that are the best looking Molan Labe

[01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:11.000]  We have a complete line of women's clothing as well.

[01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:59.000]  Moving back to Mike Howard of WNFZ94.3 in Knoxville, we also have the great folks on WBCR
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:04.000]  outside Knoxville and Truth Radio, who sat us on for 15 years so that we could spread
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:08.000]  across the country, including six other affiliates in the great state of Tennessee
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:11.000]  and Memphis and Nashville and other areas.
[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:16.000]  But Mike Howard joins us, Mike, you know, there's so many topics I wanted to get you on about,
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:19.000]  but before the show I said, what do you want to cover?
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:23.000]  And you said the tipping point, the breaking point, where you see this going.
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000]  How do you think we can defeat this?
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:30.000]  And then I want to get into White House picking up the pace on executive actions.
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:34.000]  The White House will be picking up the pace on executive actions as Congress focuses its efforts
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:37.000]  on newly formed select committee investigating Benghazi.
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:43.000]  Senior Obama advisor Dan Pfeiffer said yesterday, an op-ed of the Huffington Post,
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:48.000]  he argued that congressional Republicans are not interested in engaging on the economy.
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:52.000]  It's senior Obamacare that's shutting down the economy, instead spending time obsessing,
[01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:57.000]  trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act and ginning up politically motivated investigations.
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000]  No, Obama's been committing crimes.
[01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:02.000]  Of course, some of the Republicans are trying to gin up political stuff
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:05.000]  because the constituents are demanding it.
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:10.000]  And the Republican leadership like Boehner is busy blocking it, acting like,
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:13.000]  oh, I want to just change Obamacare, not repeal it.
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:17.000]  The White House has dismissed the select committee investigating the terrorist attacks
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:21.000]  on Benghazi Libya announced earlier this month by Speaker John Boehner.
[01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:25.000]  Boehner went on to say that if they continue to ignore Congress,
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:28.000]  he'll quote, hit a brick wall, but I think that's rhetoric.
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:31.000]  So what do you say, Mike Howard?
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:35.000]  I'm telling you right now, we need to start holding these people accountable for what they're doing.
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:38.000]  I mean, the problem is, it's all empty rhetoric.
[01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000]  Nothing's being done.
[01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:44.000]  We live in a world of sound bites and 30-second video clips,
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:47.000]  and yet they sound great and they read scripts very well
[01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:51.000]  and they stand in front of the teleprompters and they give us nice flowery speeches
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:54.000]  and they encourage us to be better.
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:59.000]  And yet we don't hold them accountable for the fact that they don't ever deliver.
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000]  They never make anything better.
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:04.000]  They never do anything to actually make anything better.
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:07.000]  It's all just whitewash.
[01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000]  It's all smoke and mirrors.
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:16.000]  And there's going to be a point where people get so sick and tired of just the endless empty rhetoric.
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:20.000]  And now it's gotten to the point now where they don't even do it well.
[01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:23.000]  I mean, James Clapper sitting in front of the Senate saying,
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:28.000]  I gave the least untruthful answer possible.
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:32.000]  I lied to you, yeah, but it was the smallest lie I could find.
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:36.000]  I mean, we have to pass the bill in order to find out what's in it.
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:39.000]  Seriously, it makes no sense.
[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000]  Well, Clapper said we are not spying on any Americans.
[01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000]  That is an absolute giant lie.
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000]  Then he lies and says it's not that big a lie.
[01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000]  He perjured himself.
[01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:51.000]  And again, historically you get to a point where if they don't get in trouble,
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:54.000]  the bottom drops out and destroys the establishment themselves
[01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000]  because everyone starts lying.
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000]  Everyone starts cheating.
[01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000]  Total confidence is lost.
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:05.000]  The establishment, all they've got lies because they're a bunch of crook scammers
[01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000]  that play golf all day.
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:11.000]  I mean, the truth is the ruling elite in this country is a joke.
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:15.000]  They sit inside that Beltway bubble, these celebs,
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:18.000]  and we put them, for some reason we put them on these pedestals
[01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000]  and we ballot their feet and say,
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:23.000]  you're special people and you're much better than we are,
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000]  please go and lead us.
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000]  And then they don't even lead us.
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000]  They do nothing.
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:33.000]  They sit there and just figure out ways to stay longer and longer in their seats
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000]  and do as little as possible.
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:38.000]  And for some reason, we keep sending them back
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000]  because it's never my guy that's bad.
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:41.000]  It's your guy that's bad.
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000]  He's the one that's doing bad things, but my guy's great.
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:44.000]  He needs to go back up.
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000]  Yeah, he's done a couple of bad things, but he needs to go back up
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000]  and have another chance.
[01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:52.000]  The people need to wake up in this country and quit being,
[01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:56.000]  fed this pablum of, you know, this person can't hold this office
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000]  because he's not electable.
[01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000]  It's not for the media to say who's electable.
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:03.000]  It's for the people here casting their votes to say who is electable
[01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000]  and who isn't electable.
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:09.000]  We're fed this idea that we can't make a decision for ourselves.
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:13.000]  And if we do, then, well, that's, you're tipping the canoe.
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000]  You're not doing what you should be doing.
[01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000]  You're not falling in line correctly.
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000]  You're stepping out of line.
[01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000]  You're being a rabble rouser.
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000]  You just need to do what the media tells you to do.
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000]  You need to do what the government tells you to do.
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000]  And as long as you're all right and you stay within that line
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:31.000]  and you listen to our line of bull to you,
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:34.000]  then just buy into it because it's all true,
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:35.000]  at least in our mind.
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000]  We're all going to pretend like it's true.
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000]  And then you just smile and keep on going.
[01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000]  There's going to be a day where people finally get to the point
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000]  where they say, this is enough.
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:46.000]  You either do what you're telling us you're going to do.
[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:49.000]  We're going to hold you accountable to this or you're gone.
[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000]  But that's when the hard work starts.
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:54.000]  That's when we have to step in and say, all right, now what do we do?
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:57.000]  The hard thing is what happens the day after that guy leaves the office
[01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000]  and we have to fill that seat back.
[01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:00.000]  That's where the hard work starts.
[01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000]  And I don't know if people are up to doing that.
[01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:07.000]  These people want to stand back and say, look, there was a time in this country
[01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:13.000]  when we held each other accountable, when we treasured hard work,
[01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:16.000]  when we actually put up on a pedestal honor,
[01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000]  and we put up on a pedestal faith,
[01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:21.000]  and we put up on a pedestal pride and dignity.
[01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:24.000]  Suddenly, those are all bad things anymore.
[01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:25.000]  You just don't do that.
[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:28.000]  You just go along with what you're told to do.
[01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:33.000]  And if you step out of line, then you're not doing the right thing.
[01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000]  And I'm done buying into that.
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:38.000]  And I think more and more people every day are done buying into that.
[01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000]  Well, I agree with you.
[01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000]  I've explained to my 14-year-old son that, you know what,
[01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000]  there was a time in this country when we made things.
[01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:48.000]  There was a time in this country when we had pride in what we did.
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:52.000]  There was a time in this country when we were at the forefront of science
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:59.000]  and technology and freedom and business, and we led the world.
[01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:02.000]  And now we stand back and go, well, we're great.
[01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:03.000]  Well, why?
[01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000]  Because we've given away all of our technology.
[01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:08.000]  We've given away all of our businesses.
[01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:12.000]  We've shipped everything off to as many places as we can.
[01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:13.000]  What do we do now?
[01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:17.000]  We just stand back and go, hey, we're great because we're staying great.
[01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000]  We're great, but we could be a whole lot better,
[01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000]  and we need to be a whole lot better.
[01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:22.000]  You're right.
[01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:25.000]  The globalists have hoarded this country out a thousand different ways
[01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:28.000]  to gain control of the globe and set up their world government.
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:31.000]  And now they're in the endgame to fully bankrupt us, shut us down,
[01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:35.000]  and dumb us down and move on to machines to fight their wars.
[01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:38.000]  And you've got the Democratic congressman saying,
[01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000]  we've proven that communism works.
[01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:44.000]  He's come out and basically said that.
[01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:47.000]  Florida rep Joe Garcia, we're going to play that clip.
[01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:51.000]  And then we're also going to play the other Democratic congressman from Georgia
[01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000]  saying that islands float in the water.
[01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:57.000]  That's an old clip to illustrate something.
[01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:00.000]  There are smart technocrats and globalist controllers
[01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:04.000]  who try to guide this planetary system for their own gain.
[01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:09.000]  But so many of the dishonorable weirdos that work for the system
[01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000]  really believe islands float.
[01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000]  They really believe Obamacare is free.
[01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:16.000]  They really believe that communism is good.
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:19.000]  And so a lot of them really are just idiots,
[01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:23.000]  but we bow down to them and let them run our lives.
[01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000]  And so that's why the world's so screwed up,
[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:28.000]  because good men and women have done nothing.
[01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:31.000]  And so now it's time to change that and stop complying with these people.
[01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:34.000]  Let's play the clip of this kook Democrat congressman,
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:37.000]  representative Joe Garcia, saying that communism's good.
[01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:38.000]  Here it is.
[01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000]  We've proved that communism works.
[01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:43.000]  We have everybody a good government job, but there's no crime.
[01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000]  But that isn't what we should be doing on the border,
[01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000]  the kind of money that we've poured into there.
[01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000]  And we're having a diminishing return.
[01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:52.000]  So while we're doing, we're spending all this money here.
[01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000]  We have border problems in...
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:59.000]  By the way, the borders in California, Texas are crime-ridden cess pits.
[01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000]  But he's saying there's low crime.
[01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000]  Mexico is wonderful.
[01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000]  Highest crime rate in the world per capita for the nation.
[01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000]  Chicago beats them out as the top city,
[01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000]  because they have a gunman there as well.
[01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:12.000]  They live under communist, basically, and mafia that's above the law.
[01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000]  Again, you live under communism.
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000]  They're exempt from it in palaces.
[01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000]  And there's no taxes too high like France,
[01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:22.000]  101% of the middle class, because the ruling elite are exempt.
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:25.000]  And they get your tax money, so, of course, it's going to be 100%.
[01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000]  Because you put up with it.
[01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000]  That's the level of tyranny you'll live under.
[01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:30.000]  What's the congressman's name?
[01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000]  Remind me, we've got the clip here.
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000]  Yeah, yeah, Hank Johnson.
[01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000]  Blom will tip over.
[01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:39.000]  And again, we've got other kooky clips from these people.
[01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000]  You know, about your kids don't belong to you.
[01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000]  But let's go ahead and play this clip of Hank Johnson.
[01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:51.000]  That the whole island will become so overly populated
[01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:57.000]  that it will tip over and capsize.
[01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:00.000]  We don't anticipate that.
[01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:06.000]  The Guam population, I think, currently about 175,000.
[01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000]  And again, with 8,000 Marines and their families,
[01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:14.000]  it's an addition of about 25,000 more into the population.
[01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:21.000]  And also, things like the environment,
[01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:26.000]  the sensitive areas of the environment, coral reefs,
[01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000]  and those kinds of things.
[01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:33.000]  But, you know, lots of people don't like to think about that.
[01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000]  Oh, that's enough.
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:36.000]  Let's Hank Johnson.
[01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000]  I want to draw an image for him, for TV viewers,
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000]  radio listeners, I'm going to describe it.
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000]  This is just for Hank Johnson and other people
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:46.000]  that literally have been put into power by the establishment
[01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:51.000]  because they're dumber than a box of tiddlywinks.
[01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000]  I mean, this is just amazing.
[01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:57.000]  You've got the ocean and the deepest place in the world
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000]  is the Marianas Trench.
[01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:03.000]  And it's, you know, 4,000 or 5,000 feet deep.
[01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000]  Okay, but in most places, you've got a lot of islands
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000]  where, like the Caribbean, around Belize,
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000]  where it's only on average about 30 feet deep.
[01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000]  And you've got islands, usually coral islands
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:16.000]  and also volcanic islands that stick up, okay?
[01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000]  So in the topography, like you see hills,
[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:21.000]  Hank Johnson, when you're driving around the countryside,
[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000]  well, if there was water over that,
[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000]  you know, where you're at at sea level,
[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000]  those hills would be islands, okay?
[01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:31.000]  You know, with things like palm trees on top of them.
[01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:35.000]  So if you build cities on those and things
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:39.000]  and you have people living on those,
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:42.000]  it doesn't top over, it's not floating.
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:46.000]  Islands aren't boats, okay?
[01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:49.000]  Then you get too many people over here
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:52.000]  and then it capsizes, all right?
[01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:55.000]  And I want to explain communism's a nightmare as well.
[01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:59.000]  Islands don't float and communism doesn't float either.
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000]  It does actually capsize.
[01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:04.000]  So just explain to you how islands work
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:08.000]  and I want to explain to Garcia how communism works.
[01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:11.000]  It's really a coming out of these people,
[01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:14.000]  the parading around that you can't have a taco party
[01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000]  or it's racist, a fiesta,
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000]  you can't have a petting zoo
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000]  because Arabs don't like you having camels.
[01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:23.000]  I mean, what is this mass mental illness?
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:24.000]  What is this?
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:29.000]  We're talking to Mike Howard of 94.3 there in Knoxville, Tennessee.
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:30.000]  Or am I extreme?
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000]  Maybe islands do float.
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000]  Maybe I'm being racist right now.
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000]  I think your drawing was racist
[01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000]  because one of your people should have been black.
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:41.000]  They were both white, but that's neither here nor there.
[01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:46.000]  You know, I'd like to tell Representative Garcia
[01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000]  that, you know, at one time,
[01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:51.000]  I actually proved that the United States works very well.
[01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:54.000]  If he wants to say that communism works, well, that's great.
[01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000]  Well, the United States works very well
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000]  and it has for a long, long time
[01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000]  and it's not going to go away anytime soon.
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000]  No matter how hard they try to make it go away,
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000]  no matter how hard they try to sink it,
[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:05.000]  we're still going to be here
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:08.000]  and we're still here and we're still fighting each and every day.
[01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:11.000]  This idea of...
[01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000]  I'm just going to sit here now and just lie to you.
[01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:14.000]  I'm just going to tell you, direct lies.
[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000]  I'm going to tell you exactly what you're...
[01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:19.000]  I'm going to tell you it has nothing matching with anything
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000]  that's going on and you're going to believe it.
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:24.000]  And we've been so beat down and so dumb down
[01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:29.000]  and so conditioned to just accept it and take it.
[01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000]  And that can't go on anymore.
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000]  That's got to stop, Alex. That's got to stop.
[01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:37.000]  But, Mike, if you question an anointed God
[01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000]  who says that islands float,
[01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000]  you're being a conspiracy theorist.
[01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:42.000]  Yeah.
[01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:43.000]  If there's any problem,
[01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000]  you're not going along with the narrative
[01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000]  and of course, the narrative is, I'm smarter than you
[01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000]  and you just need to accept that,
[01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000]  whether I'm talking about islands floating,
[01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000]  whether I'm talking about global climate change,
[01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:56.000]  whether I'm talking about whatever I decide to tell you.
[01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000]  If I tell you the sky is purple...
[01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000]  It is. That's enough racism from you. We'll be right back.
[01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000]  Memorial Day is a time of remembrance
[01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000]  of our fallen soldiers who died for our freedom.
[01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000]  In honor of these brave men and women,

[01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000]  Few filters cut out the glyphosates
[01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000]  that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:33.000]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines,
[01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:36.000]  hydrofluorosilic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000]  Fluoride is in teats and coffins
[01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000]  and waters and breads and toothpaste.
[01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:43.000]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:44.000]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:45.000]  It's time to take action.
[01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000]  It's time to filter our water.
[01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000]  Visit infowarstore.com
[01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:52.000]  and use promo code water to get 10% off
[01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:55.000]  your entire family of incredible products.
[01:53:55.000 --> 01:54:24.000]  Thank you.
[01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:39.000]  There is a method to the madness of the establishment,
[01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:43.000]  but it's mainly like a crazy person
[01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000]  making excuses for what they're doing.
[01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:48.000]  The truth is the establishment is just very nihilistic
[01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:51.000]  and doesn't care because they never get in trouble
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000]  for what they do.
[01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:56.000]  TEPCO is now releasing contaminated water into the sea,
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:01.000]  a record 560 million tons of water a day.
[01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000]  560 tons of water a day.
[01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:06.000]  They just pump it right over the melted down reactor
[01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000]  so they don't explode.
[01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:09.000]  And then it goes right in the ocean
[01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000]  and it comes right across to us.
[01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:15.000]  And you've got 75% of reactors according to CBS News.
[01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:18.000]  The Atomic Energy Commission says its agency
[01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:21.000]  says it's 91% of the 430 plus
[01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000]  water whatever it is they're leaking.
[01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:28.000]  For me, Mike Howard, a talk show host on 94.3 WNFZ
[01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:31.000]  in Knoxville on one of our great affiliates
[01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000]  that carries me, I guess six days a week there.
[01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000]  I always enjoy coming on your show.
[01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:39.000]  But looking at this, I'm just illustrating the same psychology.
[01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:42.000]  They used to run nuclear plants better.
[01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000]  Most plants in the U.S. are leaking
[01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000]  and they've turned off the alarms
[01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000]  like in Southern California saying,
[01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000]  well, we don't want to scare people.
[01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:51.000]  We've been given a waiver.
[01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:55.000]  The alarms won't go on now when we release radiation.
[01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:58.000]  And Ann Coulter says radiation is not bad for you.
[01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:03.000]  It really just sounds like crazy town to me.
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:07.000]  Well, and of course, you know, it's crazy town
[01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:11.000]  if we talk about it, not if they talk about it.
[01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000]  If they say it, then it's fact.
[01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000]  You know, it's backed by science.
[01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:16.000]  Well, why?
[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000]  Well, because we said there was a scientist that said it.
[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000]  Well, who is it? Don't mind the science guy.
[01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:23.000]  He's not really a scientist, but, you know, he plays one on TV.
[01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:24.000]  So believe that he's a scientist.
[01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:25.000]  Jama just came out and said,
[01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:28.000]  if you think cell phones are bad for your brain, you're insane.
[01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000]  When there's literally over a thousand studies,
[01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:33.000]  one in Guardian last week says definitely brain cancer.
[01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:34.000]  Yeah.
[01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000]  And then Jama just says, it doesn't matter.
[01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:37.000]  You're nuts.
[01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000]  It's crazy town.
[01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:40.000]  Yeah.
[01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:41.000]  Yeah.
[01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:47.000]  The absolute ego, the ego and maniacal,
[01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:52.000]  the insane hubris that comes out of DC each and every day.
[01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:55.000]  You stand back and I'm awed by it.
[01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:59.000]  I mean, I'm absolutely dumbfounded by it every day
[01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:00.000]  because people just buy into it.
[01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:01.000]  They say they accept it.
[01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:04.000]  They say that's fine because they said so.
[01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000]  Because they told us Obamacare was good.
[01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000]  We're just going to accept it as good.
[01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:09.000]  We see that it's bad.
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:10.000]  We know it's bad.
[01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000]  But we're going to believe that it's good
[01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:16.000]  because we can't believe anything less than that.
[01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:20.000]  The only way it changes, the only way it changes
[01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:25.000]  is that people need to start A, holding their leaders accountable.
[01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000]  And then B, they need to hold their cells accountable.
[01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000]  We need to look back in the mirror and say, look,
[01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000]  you know, we keep sending these people back here.
[01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:32.000]  Why do we do that?
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:33.000]  We start small.
[01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:34.000]  You start locally.
[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000]  You start with your own, you start with your own leaders
[01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:37.000]  in your own community.
[01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:38.000]  And then you move on to your state.
[01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:39.000]  Then you move on to your region.
[01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:40.000]  That's right.
[01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000]  Eventually people in DC go, oh, hey,
[01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:43.000]  something's going on right there.
[01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:46.000]  That's right. And the bureaucrats that are out there,
[01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:49.000]  they have to realize that believing their own propaganda
[01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:50.000]  isn't working anymore.
[01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000]  The corporate people, the police,
[01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000]  I want to come back and do five more minutes with you.
[01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000]  What is your take on the domestic,
[01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:57.000]  but start talking about it now,
[01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000]  the domestic buildup against veterans
[01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000]  and the police saying, yeah,
[01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:04.000]  we're getting armored vehicles for the coming war with vets.
[01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000]  I mean, how obvious is that?
[01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:10.000]  You know, to stand there and say, look,
[01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000]  here's good men that are going to stand up and fight.
[01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:13.000]  I mean, here we are in Tennessee.
[01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:16.000]  We had the battle of Athens here where people took up arms,
[01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000]  where vets came back and took up arms and said,
[01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:19.000]  look, there's bad things going on.
[01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000]  We're going to fight back.
[01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000]  That scares the hell out of the people up in DC.
[01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000]  So they want to go ahead and get the jump on it.
[01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000]  We're going to go ahead and knock you down
[01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000]  before you have a chance to build up.
[01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:30.000]  But you know what?
[01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:33.000]  Tyranny will always, will always turn away
[01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000]  from the light of good people.
[01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:36.000]  That's right. Stay there.
[01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000]  Tell folks about the battle of Athens.
[01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000]  When we come back in 67,
[01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000]  Mike Howard's our guest, after he leaves us,
[01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:45.000]  I'm going to have vets on with your VA stories.
[01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:46.000]  Stay with us.
[01:58:46.000 --> 01:59:12.000]  We'll see you next time.
[01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:21.000]  We'll see you next time.
[01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:53.000]  Until 3-888-253-3139.
[02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:26.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:29.000]  Final segment with Mike Howard, talk show host at Knoxville,
[02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:32.000]  94.3, where I'm on the air six days a week,
[02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000]  big days in the Sunday show.
[02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:37.000]  I always enjoy going on their morning show.
[02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000]  You can tune in there.
[02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000]  What is it? Two or three hours every morning.
[02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000]  Expanding on this, though,
[02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000]  we're going to give the phone number out here in a moment
[02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:49.000]  for vets to call in with your stories of the VA
[02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000]  and the stories of suicide,
[02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:54.000]  what you think of Obama saying there's not really a problem,
[02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000]  saying since he's doing a good job,
[02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:59.000]  what do you think of Bill Press on MSNBC and Sharpness
[02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000]  saying it's a conspiracy theory.
[02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000]  There are no problems at the VA.
[02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000]  You know, there's admitted death panels and death lists
[02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:08.000]  and warehousing of people and rationing of care.
[02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000]  I mean, that's what socialist healthcare is.
[02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:14.000]  800-259-9231.
[02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000]  In the four minutes we've got left, Mike,
[02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:19.000]  other points you'd like to make about this paramilitary buildup
[02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000]  and tell folks about the Battle of Athens.
[02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000]  I know that was a made-for-TV movie made about it,
[02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000]  but it's an amazing story.
[02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:29.000]  Yeah, it happened just to the west, south-west of us here
[02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:34.000]  in Knox County in Athens in Edouard, McMinn County.
[02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:37.000]  Basically, August 1946,
[02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:41.000]  you had vets coming back home
[02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:45.000]  and realized that their government was corrupt.
[02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:48.000]  There was voter intimidation going on.
[02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:53.000]  They tried to get some of their own people out in these offices
[02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:56.000]  to kind of clean up the local government.
[02:01:56.000 --> 02:02:01.000]  The vote came up and the elected officials,
[02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:04.000]  the corrupt officials, went in and basically stole the ballots,
[02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:08.000]  took the ballots, took the boxes and took them to the jail.
[02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:11.000]  And refused to let them be counted.
[02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:16.000]  So these vets took up arms and went and fought to get their city back.
[02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:23.000]  And I think that was the first shot across the bow in 1946.
[02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:26.000]  And now here we are in 2014,
[02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:31.000]  and the government is still terrified of these vets coming back
[02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000]  and saying, look, this isn't right.
[02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000]  It's not right how you're treating these people.
[02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:38.000]  It's not right how you're treating us.
[02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:42.000]  A vet dies basically one an hour.
[02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:46.000]  We're seeing vets die one an hour every day here in Tennessee
[02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:49.000]  due to suicide and it's not...
[02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000]  It is such a travesty.
[02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:54.000]  There's 20 plus suicides a day.
[02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000]  It's unbelievable.
[02:02:56.000 --> 02:03:01.000]  The last count, about 23 to 24 vets suicides every day.
[02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000]  So basically one an hour, we're losing.
[02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:08.000]  And to allow that to continue is so wrong.
[02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:11.000]  It's so wrong on so many levels because we owe these people everything.
[02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:12.000]  Well, absolutely.
[02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:16.000]  And again, the NFL, all of them with all their Obamacare and anti-gun stuff,
[02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000]  use the vets to sell what they're doing.
[02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:19.000]  Sure.
[02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:22.000]  And then meanwhile, they're literally enemy number one.
[02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000]  We're forcing this story out, not just the VA,
[02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:27.000]  but the militarization of the police against vets.
[02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:32.000]  It's treason and it shows the government is run by illegitimate people.
[02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:36.000]  Only a foreign power, only a globalist corporate collaborator enemy
[02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000]  would want to prepare for war with the vets
[02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:42.000]  and would only be doing that because they're planning something really horrible.
[02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000]  What do you think it is, the establishments planning,
[02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:50.000]  that's so horrible they know there's going to be a civil war?
[02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:51.000]  I'm asking you that question.
[02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000]  Oh, his Skype froze.
[02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:54.000]  Well, we just lost him.
[02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000]  Well, again, I want to thank him for joining us.
[02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:57.000]  Good interview.
[02:03:57.000 --> 02:04:02.000]  And I look forward to having those guys and his co-hosts back on in their future.
[02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:03.000]  Mike Howard.
[02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:09.000]  And that's with 94.3 WNFZ, one of our great affiliates across the country.
[02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:12.000]  We've got six affiliates now in Tennessee.
[02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:18.000]  That's good for our show in a state that size in the big cities there and the rural areas.
[02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:22.000]  So 94.3 WNFZ knocks talk radio.
[02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:25.000]  So very exciting to have those guys.
[02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000]  Well, we've been on there a couple of years now,
[02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000]  but first he had us on Sundays.
[02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000]  It got popular and they put this up at night.
[02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000]  And then, you know, that's how it works.
[02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:38.000]  That's why I do the Sunday show for now six years is give stations a taste for the show.
[02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000]  They go, hey, this isn't what everybody said.
[02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:41.000]  He's a crazy guy.
[02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:42.000]  This is really good.
[02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:43.000]  Our listeners like this.
[02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:44.000]  We like this.
[02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000]  And they put us on weeknights and then weekdays.
[02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000]  And so that's how it works all across the country.
[02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:52.000]  Over 170 affiliates now across the United States.
[02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:55.000]  Stay with us.
[02:04:55.000 --> 02:05:21.000]  We'll be right back on the other side with your phone calls and more.
[02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:26.000]  To break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families
[02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000]  and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:32.000]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000]  We are the true media.
[02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:37.000]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:41.000]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war.

[02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:01.000]  I don't know what it is.
[02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.000]  Ralph just won't pay any attention to me.
[02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:07.000]  When he comes home from work, all he ever does is play video games and go to sleep.
[02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.000]  It's like I don't even exist.
[02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:11.000]  Oh Betty, that's just awful.
[02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:20.000]  Does this seem familiar? If the answer to this question is yes, then listen carefully. Toxic pesticides, GMO foods and additives, BPA plastics, contaminated water supplies.
[02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:25.000]  Many of these toxic additives are deliberately engineered to attack and weaken human masculinity.
[02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:28.000]  It's part of the eugenics population control movement.
[02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:29.000]  Look it up.

[02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:04.000]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:08.000]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:12.000]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:15.000]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:22.000]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:26.000]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:37.000]  Few filters cut out the glyphosates that is found in water supplies worldwide. Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosalic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:41.000]  All right, it is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:45.000]  It is our responsibility to protect our families. The establishment's not going to do it.
[02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:48.000]  It's time to take action. It's time to filter our water.

[02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000]  Thank you, space is coming to you.
[02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:10.000]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000]  All right, you are a ghost.
[02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:18.000]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:29.000]  Rand Paul set to start part two of his epic fellowbuster today.
[02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:34.000]  We're going to be covering that on the nightly news and tomorrow with highlights at Infowars.com.
[02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:41.000]  Well, just breaking minutes ago via Politico, Nancy Pelosi names Democrats
[02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:45.000]  or Benghazi panel.
[02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:49.000]  House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has officially tapped five Democrats.
[02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:56.000]  Elijah Cummings, Adam Smith, Adam Schiff, Lisa Sanchez, and Tammy Duckworth
[02:08:56.000 --> 02:09:02.000]  to the special committee charged with investigating the Benghazi attacks.
[02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:06.000]  The Republicans know exactly what happened here.
[02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:12.000]  It was a hit of Stevens by the local al-Qaeda force used by the Pentagon and NATO
[02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:17.000]  to run security in Benghazi that had been used as the main command city to bring down Libya.
[02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:23.000]  The ambassador didn't want to transfer three warehouses of service to air missiles and other heavy arms
[02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:25.000]  to al-Qaeda for the Syria war.
[02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:30.000]  The Turkish ambassador threw a fit and they sent an al-Qaeda to murder everyone
[02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:34.000]  but two Navy SEALs showed up from behind, flanked the al-Qaeda forces
[02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:38.000]  and instead of them taking an hour to get in and kill everybody, it took them almost eight hours.
[02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:42.000]  That drew attention to it so the military knows what happened.
[02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:45.000]  There is Benghazi.
[02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:50.000]  I want to go to your phone calls right now, then I'm going to get to other news
[02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:56.000]  dealing with simply amazing information in Albuquerque,
[02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000]  the place where they keep shooting homeless people on the back and stuff
[02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:03.000]  and saying they're above the law and celebrating when they do it
[02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:07.000]  and not letting folks in their city council and just everything else.
[02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:13.000]  I mean, it's really a scary city, a federal model of liberal tyranny.
[02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:18.000]  A law student gets pulled over, he wants to invoke his fourth amendment
[02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:22.000]  so the police pull him out, spread his legs and start kneeling him in the testicles
[02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:29.000]  till he loses a testicle and the police defend it.
[02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:33.000]  And it's all because he talked about the law to them.
[02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:37.000]  The full unedited video is there on infowars.com, we have a clip of the newscast coming up
[02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:41.000]  but man, that is really creepy.
[02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:48.000]  I like New Mexico and Albuquerque is a pretty town in my view.
[02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:53.000]  You go over the hills and it's gone on that bull but it's just really scary,
[02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:56.000]  the amount of evil coming out of there, really, really creepy.
[02:10:56.000 --> 02:11:00.000]  Now we have this story up on infowars.com, it's red linked.
[02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:07.000]  VA supervisor, older veterans should be shot in the head to save money, exclusive.
[02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:12.000]  Whistleblower reveals new veterans affairs scandal and to be clear,
[02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:20.000]  this person is pretty senior at the hospital and their voice is very clear.
[02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:24.000]  They didn't want to disguise their voice but they obviously don't want to be exposed at this time
[02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:29.000]  so we made the decision not to release their name and where it is on the east coast.
[02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:33.000]  We got a bunch of other whistleblowers that are about to reveal where they are and name names
[02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:36.000]  of stuff even more insane.
[02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:39.000]  Like people saying they're going to commit suicide or they don't get health care,
[02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:45.000]  not getting it and committing suicide because they're in so much pain.
[02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:50.000]  But I want to play a clip of this, the full 14 minute interview is up at infowars.com
[02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000]  if you want to go see it and hear it.
[02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:57.000]  But here is the whistleblower talking about the type of stuff that's being said
[02:11:57.000 --> 02:12:01.000]  and being done at this particular facility, here it is.
[02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:09.000]  You have supervisors in supervisory positions in this hospital that have been made statements.
[02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:14.000]  Racial slurs against veterans have made statements that older veterans,
[02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:20.000]  they should just be taken outside and shot in the head because they're worthless.
[02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:25.000]  And this person still works there and he still is supervised.
[02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:31.000]  Now this attitude comes from this idea with the socialists that there's only so much money and resources
[02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:36.000]  and new kids being born, old people being taken care of, veterans being taken care of,
[02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000]  that's why we're broke.
[02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:41.000]  No, we're broke because we've been signed on to globalism
[02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:48.000]  and it's designed in actuaries to bankrupt us and to have artificial scarcity under a Gena 21
[02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000]  and Cloward and Piven.
[02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:54.000]  And everybody better learn what a Gena 21 and Cloward and Piven is.
[02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:57.000]  And they did this in feudalism thousands of years ago,
[02:12:57.000 --> 02:13:04.000]  long before the professors came along for the White House and did Cloward and Piven, husband and wife.
[02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:08.000]  And they said we're going to create so much socialism and shut down the economy
[02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:11.000]  and bankrupt America to fully socialize.
[02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:14.000]  Because socialism can't compete with free market, they know that.
[02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:19.000]  But they want to run the culture so they will wreck the whole system and take control of it.
[02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000]  They will tear it down to build it back up.
[02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:23.000]  But they don't build it back up as a good thing.
[02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:30.000]  It would be immoral if they were trying to make us slaves to make us free later.
[02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000]  Plus that never works.
[02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:36.000]  But they are immoral people that can't produce, they want to run your life.
[02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:39.000]  It's always nobodies that want to run other people's lives.
[02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:46.000]  The coolest, smartest, best looking artist and people, you know, they want to be left alone.
[02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:47.000]  They want to be reclusive.
[02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:49.000]  They've got their close group of friends.
[02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:56.000]  The coolest people I know are reclusive and only have a few good friends
[02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:59.000]  and like to have a good time and want to be left alone.
[02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:04.000]  And don't want to run your life because they're so confident.
[02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:10.000]  We all know weirdos that obsess on you, want to tell you what to do, want to run your life.
[02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:14.000]  These people are the bane of civilization.
[02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:18.000]  And I'm sorry to all the cool people out there who don't want power and who want to be left alone
[02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:26.000]  and already have power and are already successful and want to hide from all of the scum.
[02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000]  I understand.
[02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:35.000]  Those of us that do know how the world works, who do have confidence and things,
[02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:36.000]  it's our job.
[02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:40.000]  We have to go out and displace these control freaks and reestablish liberty
[02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000]  or they're going to enslave all of us, okay?
[02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:45.000]  They don't like us.
[02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:52.000]  And I must say, I'm the greatest guy around, but compared to these control freaks I am,
[02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000]  they want to morally tell us we're nobodies.
[02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:58.000]  And again, I've noticed who they hate.
[02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:02.000]  You can talk to like really beautiful women and they'll tell you that nobody comes up and asks them out for a day
[02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:05.000]  because everybody's so intimidated by them.
[02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:07.000]  Instead, people are rude to them and mean to them.
[02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:14.000]  Really good looking men, it's the same thing.
[02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000]  You'd think people that were really good looking would have it all great.
[02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000]  No, that's not the way it is.
[02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:22.000]  It is with some people who are confident and aren't intimidated by it,
[02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:25.000]  but for a lot of people they're going to mess with you.
[02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:30.000]  It's the same thing if you're an artist, if you're a writer, if you have a company, if you have an army,
[02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:31.000]  take media.
[02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:35.000]  When you've got strong media operation or having a big effect in changing society,
[02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:40.000]  there's all these people that say it should be mine and so they try to bring you down.
[02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:41.000]  They lie about you.
[02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:43.000]  They lie about World Net Daily.
[02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:44.000]  They lie about Info Wars.
[02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000]  They lie about DrudgeReport.com.
[02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:53.000]  The mainline Republicans lie about libertarian conservatives because they're threatened by us
[02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:56.000]  because we are calling BS on them.
[02:15:56.000 --> 02:16:00.000]  They're a fraud.
[02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000]  We're annihilating MSNBC.
[02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.000]  Info Wars online just dwarfs them.
[02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:08.000]  We're showing those graphs right now.
[02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:14.000]  We are 1,000 plus paces ahead of them on the Alexa ratings.
[02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000]  They are plunging.
[02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000]  We are rising.
[02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:21.000]  So, of course, they hate us because we don't tell you what to think.
[02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:26.000]  We don't tell you that you're a piece of crap and that only we have the answers.
[02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:27.000]  We tell you you're great.
[02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:29.000]  You're wonderful when you embrace liberty.
[02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:33.000]  They sit there lecturing you all day about what scum you are.
[02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:38.000]  And so, of course, they hate veterans, folks, because these people hate men.
[02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:39.000]  They hate strength.
[02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:40.000]  They hate courage.
[02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:47.000]  They absolutely are threatened by masculinity, period, because it's the antithesis of what they stand for.
[02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:50.000]  They want the big, powerful state.
[02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:51.000]  They want the drones.
[02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:56.000]  They want the weapons to dominate men and women.
[02:16:56.000 --> 02:17:01.000]  They put fluorine in the water because they're so weak they want to stun you
[02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:08.000]  like an electric eel stuns its prey before it eats it or a spider or a snake.
[02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000]  They're scum and they know they're scum.
[02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:11.000]  I'm going to go to your phone calls.
[02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:14.000]  Rufus, Holmes, Casey, Eric, Allen.
[02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:17.000]  And I want to hear from VA whistleblowers particularly.
[02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:20.000]  Rufus from FEMA Region 5.
[02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:23.000]  I guess that was formerly Missouri or something, I'm guessing.
[02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:24.000]  Work for VA Hospital.
[02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000]  Rufus, thanks for calling.
[02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000]  Tell us your story.
[02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000]  I don't know where to begin.
[02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000]  What do you want to hear about first?
[02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:35.000]  Hey, whatever you think is most important.
[02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:43.000]  Well, I will say that I was a veteran worker at the VA Hospital for over four years
[02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:46.000]  before I moved to where I am now.
[02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:52.000]  And I'll say veterans were definitely treated as the lowest of the low.
[02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000]  I'm trying to think of an example.
[02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:57.000]  Maybe someone who works in a fast food restaurant and there's the one homeless guy
[02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:59.000]  that comes in asking for a glass of ice water.
[02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:04.000]  That's how they were treated, like that person.
[02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:09.000]  If they were lost looking for an office, it was just a culture of no.
[02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:10.000]  Go away.
[02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:11.000]  I don't care what you need.
[02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:13.000]  I don't care what you're here for.
[02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000]  Go away and go bother someone else.
[02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:21.000]  And the best way to describe it is as if the DMV opened a hospital.
[02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:24.000]  That's really what the whole place was like.
[02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:25.000]  Perfect description.
[02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:28.000]  What do you want to say to Bill Press that says you're a liar?
[02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:31.000]  Al Sharpton says it's racist, basically.
[02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:36.000]  And it's a conspiracy theory that the vets are treated heavenly.
[02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:37.000]  Just go there.
[02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:39.000]  It's a dirty place.
[02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:40.000]  It smells.
[02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:45.000]  Any veteran that has insurance through their job will not go there.
[02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:48.000]  It's mostly the poor veteran.
[02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:54.000]  What I learned being a non-military person, I grew to dislike the military
[02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:57.000]  because I see what they do to these poor folks.
[02:18:57.000 --> 02:19:00.000]  The Vietnam vets, the Korea vets.
[02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000]  I didn't see them as useless.
[02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:08.000]  I think they have not lived up to their potential because of what we've done to them.
[02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:12.000]  But that's the government's fault for doing that.
[02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:17.000]  We have made them useless, but that was a consequence of war.
[02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:18.000]  Well, that's right.
[02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:21.000]  In societies, they don't take other veterans or pure scum.
[02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:24.000]  And look, what you do to the least of me you've done to me, Christ said,
[02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:28.000]  anybody the globalists have their clutches on, they absolutely screw over.
[02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:32.000]  And now that we learn their secret death panel list for them,
[02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:37.000]  did you ever see warehousing of the really old ones like, hey, don't give him care?
[02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:38.000]  Did you ever see that?
[02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:41.000]  Well, no, I did not see that.
[02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:49.000]  But my office was a converted patient room because there was a limited space.
[02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:52.000]  And I shared that with several other people.
[02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:55.000]  Well, sure, that's compartmentalized by the doctor ethics boards, too.
[02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:58.000]  You don't hear that just the treatment orders come down.
[02:19:58.000 --> 02:19:59.000]  Thank you for the call.
[02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:28.000]  We'll be back.
[02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:58.000]  We'll see.
[02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:02.000]  In the near future.
[02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:06.000]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000]  Alert, security, alert.
[02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000]  This is Homeland Security.
[02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:14.000]  Analysis, Info Wars, building independent media operations.
[02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:19.000]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:21.000]  Prime Directed, discredit Alex Jones.
[02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:24.000]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theory.
[02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:28.000]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called Info Wars.
[02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:32.000]  We don't know what he is, except a conspiracy theory.
[02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:35.000]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:37.000]  They're never going to stop.
[02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:41.000]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:45.000]  Block free iPhone app at InfoWars.com.
[02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:48.000]  Block free podcast and video feed.
[02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:51.000]  Imperatives, Detroit, Britain, and its TV.
[02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:53.000]  You got a censor eye on the enemy.
[02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:56.000]  Not worried about what propaganda they put out.
[02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:59.000]  Holy, it's but God, you can fail it.
[02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:30.000]  To a burglar, it looks like someone must be home watching TV,
[02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:33.000]  so they'll likely move on to an easier target.
[02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:39.000]  At only $29.95, fake TV costs less than a month of most alarm monitoring plans
[02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:41.000]  and comes with free shipping.
[02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:48.000]  Order your fake TV by calling 877-5-FAKE-TV or go to faketv.com.
[02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:54.000]  That's 877-532-5388 or faketv.com.
[02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:57.000]  The burglar deterrent.
[02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:32.000]  The best refuel stoves on the market for disasters at survival are Silverfire.
[02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:36.000]  Its clean-cooked stove technology allows you to pasteurize emergency drinking water,
[02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:39.000]  cook a meal, or sanitize your cookware with just twigs.
[02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:43.000]  A U.S. veteran-owned company, Silverfire's mission is emergency and recreation cooking products
[02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:45.000]  made of quality stainless steel.
[02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:49.000]  Silverfire's wide line of indoor and outdoor models range from solo backpack models
[02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:52.000]  to large family units cooked cleanly and for free.
[02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:55.000]  Get yours today at Silverfire.us.
[02:23:55.000 --> 02:24:24.000]  That's Silverfire.us.
[02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:32.000]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, for folks that know, that listened to my show over the last 19 years,
[02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:38.000]  up until about six, seven years ago, I didn't understand the whole veteran thing.
[02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:42.000]  I knew the globalists were using the military to build a world government.
[02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:47.000]  I knew they were funding the radical Muslims at the same time to create the crisis.
[02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:54.000]  And I would not give all the lip service to the veterans because I didn't want to be fake.
[02:24:54.000 --> 02:25:01.000]  And it wasn't till I matured a lot and realized that veterans were a core part of our audience.
[02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:04.000]  They had always been. Not most of my family are veterans.
[02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:10.000]  And then I realized the globalists hated their guts because they're a key piece of this puzzle.
[02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:18.000]  Then I realized just how important the veterans are and how horribly they're treated.
[02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:25.000]  And I guess it's a camaraderie because in the Liberty Movement, we are the second most demonized group.
[02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:30.000]  It's veterans and then it's libertarians and godowners and constitutionalists.
[02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.000]  And we're all in this together. We're in the same army.
[02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:36.000]  We're in the same Marine Corps. We're in the same Air Force, whatever you want to call it.
[02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.000]  We're in the same Info War together.
[02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:41.000]  The enemy has put us together and said that we're its enemy.
[02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:44.000]  So we're in this together back to back, folks.
[02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:47.000]  They're coming after all of us.
[02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:51.000]  And they're scum.
[02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:55.000]  And, you know, you've got Memorial Day coming up and they'll be all this lip service.
[02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:59.000]  And it makes me sick. It makes me sick.
[02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:04.000]  When everything our veterans reportedly have fought and died for, he's being overturned.
[02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:12.000]  And you got scum openly announcing that communism is good in Congress.
[02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:13.000]  It's crazy.
[02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:18.000]  Let's go to your phone calls. Let's talk to Holmes in Texas and Casey, Eric, Alan, Michael and others.
[02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:21.000]  Go ahead, Holmes. Thanks for holding.
[02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:24.000]  It's actually a Thomas, but that's okay.
[02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:28.000]  I'm sorry. They didn't put the T on there. It says Holmes on there.
[02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:30.000]  So Thomas, I apologize. Go ahead.
[02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:34.000]  Okay, sir. I have privilege to talk to you. Tell my story.
[02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:39.000]  I'll start off with when I first started in having any interaction with the VA.
[02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:43.000]  I got out of the military when I was 21. And right as I was getting out,
[02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:48.000]  I started developing symptoms of what I now know is what's called cyclic vomiting syndrome.
[02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:52.000]  To summarize it, I basically start throwing up for like a week, two weeks.
[02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:55.000]  I can't keep anything down. I have horrible abdominal pain.
[02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:58.000]  It gets so bad where I have to end up going to the hospital.
[02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:01.000]  I'll go to the hospital. They'll give me IVs. They'll give me potassium.
[02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:06.000]  I've been hospitalized for probably six times since I've gotten out of the military.
[02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:11.000]  And every single time, it seems like when I first, the very first time I went in Buffalo,
[02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:16.000]  I was being treated great. It was some of the best care I'd gotten.
[02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:22.000]  And then the last two times I've gone to try and be hospitalized, it's a completely different system.
[02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.000]  It's like they don't care anymore.
[02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:27.000]  Like I said, I have horrible, horrible pain.
[02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:32.000]  And whenever I go, I go to the ER and then they eventually admit me to the hospital.
[02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:37.000]  Well, while they're waiting to be admitted, I'm in pain. So I'm moaning. I'm making sounds.
[02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:39.000]  And they're telling me to please keep it down.
[02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:43.000]  Like I have any control over that. It's not voluntary. I don't want it.
[02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:47.000]  When you're talking about the VA, well, you've led us to the real point and what we should be covering here.
[02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:49.000]  And I want to direct my whole crew to do this.
[02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:53.000]  Secret experimentation on troops, black people, you name it, foster kids.
[02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:59.000]  Any group, the eugenicists that run the feds, have control of, since about World War I,
[02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:04.000]  will be given different vaccines and things as a test.
[02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:11.000]  I talked to one of Rick Perry's top people eight years ago who came to in-game blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.000]  And I had some people talking to me later.
[02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:16.000]  I saw the guy on TV and realized, wow, that really guy works for Rick Perry.
[02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:19.000]  He said, look, Rick Perry's a good guy. We heard he was in your movie.
[02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:21.000]  We don't want to be enemies.
[02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:24.000]  And I said, well, he shouldn't be trying to force girls to take Gardasil.
[02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:29.000]  He said, listen, I worked at Fort Sam Houston. Before I did this, I was in the Army.
[02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:33.000]  And he said, they brought special forces in. We were told to give them these shots.
[02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:35.000]  All of them died. They wouldn't tell us what it was.
[02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:44.000]  We went in decon suits, sprayed it down with bleach, moved out all the bunks and stuff and threw them away.
[02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:45.000]  That's what they're doing.
[02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:51.000]  So when they give you hundreds of shots and experimental anthrax shots and the rest of it,
[02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:55.000]  they are testing things on you and quote, quote, soft killing you.
[02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:59.000]  I'm going to hold you over if need be, Thomas, but do you know what soft kill is?
[02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:04.000]  Yes. I've been, what I'd say, awake for about a year now.
[02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:07.000]  I've been listening to you and I do a lot of personal research on my own.
[02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:12.000]  I like to think of myself as an info warrior. People are always calling me crazy and saying,
[02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:15.000]  oh, stop talking about it, but I'm not going to stop talking about it.
[02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:19.000]  Because I'd much rather fight the info war before we started fighting another shooting war.
[02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:24.000]  I've shot people. I've been shot. It's not fun. Let's keep it from getting there as much as we can.
[02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:29.000]  Anything else you want to add? I mean, what do you think causes all these mystery illnesses in the troops?
[02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:34.000]  I mean, it's on record. They're giving you deadly anthrax shots and smallpox shots that have been killing people.
[02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:36.000]  I mean, what do you think is doing it?
[02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.000]  I have no idea, to be honest.
[02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:40.000]  What did you work in and around?
[02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:45.000]  I was infantry. So I really didn't have like chemicals. I was around. I was just normal.
[02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:48.000]  Were you around DU? Were you around DU?
[02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:49.000]  Stay there.
[02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:50.000]  Yeah.
[02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:51.000]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:52.000]  Yeah, I thought so.
[02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:53.000]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:54.000]  Do you fry your guts?
[02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:56.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:56.000 --> 02:30:19.000]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:20.000]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:45.000]  I'm Alex Jones.

[02:31:00.120 --> 02:31:05.500]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more
[02:31:05.500 --> 02:31:10.200]  toxic each and every day. But it's not just the air outside that's toxic. Indoor air has
[02:31:10.200 --> 02:31:14.400]  been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor
[02:31:14.400 --> 02:31:19.480]  air. And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their
[02:31:19.480 --> 02:31:24.320]  homes. There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States. Well over a thousand
[02:31:24.320 --> 02:31:28.480]  types of mold and mildew link to numerous conditions. And don't forget the fact that
[02:31:28.480 --> 02:31:32.720]  6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well. When I began to research
[02:31:32.720 --> 02:31:37.520]  these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order

[02:33:16.160 --> 02:33:33.440]  liberty. It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:33.440 --> 02:33:37.520]  Charity is something that historically comes in a lot of different flavors and different
[02:33:37.520 --> 02:33:43.240]  packages, but on the inside it's the same thing. It's groups that want total control
[02:33:43.240 --> 02:33:50.440]  in a run society who use the structure of government or any major system to expand a
[02:33:50.440 --> 02:33:57.960]  larger system of control. And it always targets the old government, especially if it was a
[02:33:57.960 --> 02:34:03.560]  liberty based system by one degree. If the old system was better in any way, they will
[02:34:03.560 --> 02:34:08.160]  go after it and they will always go after and purge the veterans. And they'll purge
[02:34:08.160 --> 02:34:13.360]  the police when they're done as well. And we have a particularly virulent type of takeover
[02:34:13.360 --> 02:34:16.520]  happening right now. Thomas, then we'll go to Casey, Eric, Alan and Michael. I'm going
[02:34:16.520 --> 02:34:22.840]  to hurry now. Finishing up your point. Look, it's the vaccines. They had the anthrax shots
[02:34:22.840 --> 02:34:27.120]  in the mid 90s and again in 2000 they were given folks that were killing based doctors
[02:34:27.120 --> 02:34:31.600]  that took it. So they had mutinies of doctors and it wasn't really mutinies. The media called
[02:34:31.600 --> 02:34:36.360]  it that who said we're not giving this so it brought attention to BioPort and how deadly
[02:34:36.360 --> 02:34:41.160]  it was. And then it was killing people. Same thing with the smallpox shot that killed some
[02:34:41.160 --> 02:34:47.360]  reporters that took it. So national reporters, one of them was NBC had a heart attack. That's
[02:34:47.360 --> 02:34:52.240]  what it can cause you to have as an autoimmune response in the heart valves. This is stuff
[02:34:52.240 --> 02:34:56.800]  that is extremely experimental. It doesn't protect you. They admitted the anthrax shot
[02:34:56.800 --> 02:35:01.120]  didn't protect you and cause serious autoimmune disorders, but it's everything else they're
[02:35:01.120 --> 02:35:08.120]  giving you. Project Shad, the nerve gassing of troops where they would kill troops, British
[02:35:08.120 --> 02:35:12.720]  and U.S. just in the, even in the 80s and tell their families, oh, your husband died
[02:35:12.720 --> 02:35:20.720]  of the flu. They would even dissect their body, their bodies. So this is what's going
[02:35:20.720 --> 02:35:26.200]  on. You were seen as scum. You were seen as trash because the ruling elite are you, Genesis,
[02:35:26.200 --> 02:35:33.400]  that's their attitude to begin with. All right, let's go ahead and go back to your calls.
[02:35:33.400 --> 02:35:38.280]  Thomas, do you think it's DU? Do you think it's the vaccines that's causing you to have
[02:35:38.280 --> 02:35:41.440]  all these health problems? Because you look statistically at the veterans. I mean, they
[02:35:41.440 --> 02:35:46.160]  are just in desperate straits and then they can't get healthcare. As you said, used to
[02:35:46.160 --> 02:35:49.880]  be bad. Now it's really bad. I guess you're supposed to go curl up and die. Do you have
[02:35:49.880 --> 02:35:55.720]  any idea what did it to you? I personally think it has to do with the GMOs and fluoride
[02:35:55.720 --> 02:35:59.240]  in the water. See, before I was ignorant to that knife, I'm not going to lie. I ate very
[02:35:59.240 --> 02:36:04.320]  unhealthy. I lived at the jack in the box. And since I've cut that out of my life, I
[02:36:04.320 --> 02:36:09.440]  slowed down a lot. And I noticed if I'll go and eat some fast food or cheap GMO food,
[02:36:09.440 --> 02:36:16.680]  I get sick right afterwards. I feel it's an effect of our environment. And that's why
[02:36:16.680 --> 02:36:20.120]  I mean, I'll be on the road sometimes and all there is is a Wendy's or a jack in the
[02:36:20.120 --> 02:36:25.600]  box. And I got to eat and I ate a jack in the box and literally had what I call a panic
[02:36:25.600 --> 02:36:30.040]  attack an hour later. I never have stuff like that unless I eat it. Then you read what they're
[02:36:30.040 --> 02:36:34.960]  allowed to put in it. All these drugs that they call fillers, they're really psychoactive
[02:36:34.960 --> 02:36:39.600]  drugs that addict the general public. But if you haven't done it in a while, it really
[02:36:39.600 --> 02:36:46.320]  hits you hard just like any drug. And you're absolutely right that this is, listen, there's
[02:36:46.320 --> 02:36:51.160]  a London Telegraph article today about are you allergic to your cell phone? Because people
[02:36:51.160 --> 02:36:55.680]  are getting so sick around this stuff, of course. And the fact is most people are getting
[02:36:55.680 --> 02:37:01.200]  soft killed, being sterilized by it and don't know because it takes 20 years. You want to
[02:37:01.200 --> 02:37:09.720]  be glad you're so probably allergic to this GMO that your body's rejecting it. So that's
[02:37:09.720 --> 02:37:14.520]  some good intel, good information. Thank you for the call. You know, the body gets overwhelmed
[02:37:14.520 --> 02:37:19.040]  to it could be all the vaccines, the DU you name it. Then it shows that when you're maxed
[02:37:19.040 --> 02:37:26.560]  out, then other stuff triggers allergies. People didn't used to be allergic to Cedar, Mountain
[02:37:26.560 --> 02:37:31.120]  Cedar, Mountain Jennifer. They didn't used to be allergic to peanuts, strawberries. I
[02:37:31.120 --> 02:37:36.120]  mean, the schools are like medical facilities now with all the special diets and bubble
[02:37:36.120 --> 02:37:40.160]  kids because they're not being breastfed. They're not being brought up with an environment.
[02:37:40.160 --> 02:37:46.240]  They don't play outside anymore. They have their normal buffers. And then they're given
[02:37:46.240 --> 02:37:52.960]  all these vaccines. One flu shot. The Canadian government did the study five years ago during
[02:37:52.960 --> 02:37:59.800]  the H1N1. One flu shot cuts your immune system to the regular flu by 50%. One, three flu
[02:37:59.800 --> 02:38:04.960]  shots doubles your chances of Alzheimer's. Don't believe me. Just search into that term.
[02:38:04.960 --> 02:38:13.920]  How big a new story is that? We are being murdered. I've had multiple family members
[02:38:13.920 --> 02:38:18.200]  that got the Dalcon shield back in the 70s. I'm not going to say names or family will
[02:38:18.200 --> 02:38:25.480]  get mad. People very close to me. They call it an IED, not an improvised closer device,
[02:38:25.480 --> 02:38:33.840]  but an internal little device that goes around inside the uterus to keep you an IUD that
[02:38:33.840 --> 02:38:38.440]  goes around and keeps you from ever forming and being able to have an egg attached creates
[02:38:38.440 --> 02:38:43.000]  continued inflammation. Turns out they knew when they approved that in the late 60s that
[02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:48.080]  they knew in clinical studies on humans or people approved to be part of the study that
[02:38:48.080 --> 02:38:54.560]  it caused endometriosis, destroyed the interlining of the uterus, and caused massive infertility.
[02:38:54.560 --> 02:39:04.520]  And two people in my family that got that were sterilized by it. Turns out that Dow
[02:39:04.520 --> 02:39:11.160]  Chemical in association with Monsanto did not just have Agent Orange with what they
[02:39:11.160 --> 02:39:18.160]  called it weed killer, defoliant. They added a neurotoxin synthetic cobra poison. This
[02:39:18.160 --> 02:39:22.880]  was declassified about six years ago. Dr. Doug Rocky, former head of the DE program,
[02:39:22.880 --> 02:39:26.920]  broke it here. The document was declassified. No one was covering it. He said, have you
[02:39:26.920 --> 02:39:32.880]  seen this? We broke it here. Not bragging. I'm just saying it broke here. The document
[02:39:32.880 --> 02:39:38.800]  from the mid 60s where they added it, it was really a chemical weapon. A chemical weapon
[02:39:38.800 --> 02:39:48.920]  to actually nerve gas the Viet Cong and call it, call it just the dioxin defoliant, which
[02:39:48.920 --> 02:39:59.120]  is bad enough. It was neurotoxin. They added neurotoxin and our troops were in it and they
[02:39:59.120 --> 02:40:06.840]  knew it. I mean, the government is run by murdering total filth. The average social
[02:40:06.840 --> 02:40:11.000]  worker is not bad. The average cop is not bad. The average FBI is not bad. The average
[02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:19.520]  CIA person is not bad. I can tell you that they're compartmentalized, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:40:19.520 --> 02:40:26.760]  and the people on top of this are pure evil and take real enjoyment in hurting our veterans
[02:40:26.760 --> 02:40:29.600]  especially because they're getting rid of you. They don't need you anymore. They're
[02:40:29.600 --> 02:40:36.400]  moving to robots and drones, autonomous vehicles. By 2025, there'll be no combat troops to speak
[02:40:36.400 --> 02:40:41.480]  of, folks, except for special operations. And they'll be there with robots. It's over
[02:40:41.480 --> 02:40:47.160]  if we don't stop them. You've been warned this is real. This isn't sensational. Reality
[02:40:47.160 --> 02:40:53.560]  is sensational. The things I've seen, the things I've done personally are sensational.
[02:40:53.560 --> 02:40:58.080]  A lot of it, I won't even tell you some of the stuff I know, folks, because people can't
[02:40:58.080 --> 02:41:05.240]  handle the truth. You want answers? To quote, what is it, maybe a few good men? Then we
[02:41:05.240 --> 02:41:11.480]  can pull that up online. You want answers? You can't handle the truth. And I'm telling
[02:41:11.480 --> 02:41:16.400]  you, folks, we're two minutes to midnight. The globalists think they're God. They're
[02:41:16.400 --> 02:41:21.720]  operating as an alien species. And I'm not saying they're real aliens. They call themselves
[02:41:21.720 --> 02:41:29.000]  a new breakaway species. They consider themselves to be God. And if you try to get in their
[02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:33.320]  way, there will be warfare. Well, let me tell you something. Hillary Clinton didn't God.
[02:41:33.320 --> 02:41:37.360]  Barack Obama didn't God. David Rockefeller in God. I've been know about these people,
[02:41:37.360 --> 02:41:42.640]  their lives, what they stand for. They are narcissistic scum and the very last people
[02:41:42.640 --> 02:41:49.000]  to lead humanity. They are literally desecrating our human spirit, and they are the filth of
[02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:54.280]  the earth. Casey, then Eric, Alan, Barbara, Michael, everybody. Casey, thanks for holding
[02:41:54.280 --> 02:41:58.600]  you're on the air, an army vet. What is your take on the VA? What's your story?
[02:41:58.600 --> 02:42:05.680]  Well, the VA takes about six months to lift a finger to pick their own nose. So you can
[02:42:05.680 --> 02:42:16.200]  imagine what it takes them to do our files. And that's the guys that actually get care.
[02:42:16.200 --> 02:42:25.720]  The guys that don't get care, they're done. And if we got time, I'd actually like to try
[02:42:25.720 --> 02:42:36.520]  and wake you up. Now, go ahead, brother. Okay. You're always talking about, you know, we've
[02:42:36.520 --> 02:42:42.040]  got to do this and do that to, you know, get the right people in. How can we do that in
[02:42:42.040 --> 02:42:50.520]  a corrupt system? You're a chalkboard analogy would be perfect or a white whiteboard analogy
[02:42:50.520 --> 02:42:59.880]  for the younger listeners. At some point, you have to erase it. Now, just to cover your
[02:42:59.880 --> 02:43:05.080]  butt. No, I know. But generally, when you erase something, the corruption is already
[02:43:05.080 --> 02:43:09.960]  there. It gets even worse. I'd like to work on the template of the Bill of Rights Constitution.
[02:43:09.960 --> 02:43:13.240]  But don't worry, they're probably going to start a civil war. And so everybody talking
[02:43:13.240 --> 02:43:16.560]  about violence, you're going to get your shot. I mean, it's going to be hell. Go ahead.
[02:43:16.560 --> 02:43:23.120]  Oh, no, I'm not talking about violence. I don't want violence. I'm an infantry veteran.
[02:43:23.120 --> 02:43:30.120]  I've spent two tours in Iraq and it's no, we don't want violence in the country. But
[02:43:30.120 --> 02:43:36.640]  with as corrupt as the system is, the absolute minimum I see that we're going to be able
[02:43:36.640 --> 02:43:44.200]  to do to get our country back is to march on Washington and arrest every politician
[02:43:44.200 --> 02:43:52.960]  in every single branch of government, executive, legislative and judicial branches of government.
[02:43:52.960 --> 02:44:04.800]  And we need to start all over with new patriotic people. Do you think all of them are guilty
[02:44:04.800 --> 02:44:13.440]  because the issue is they need to have trials? Even yes, I agree. They all need to have trials,
[02:44:13.440 --> 02:44:18.880]  but we need to arrest every single one of them first, put them on trial, and then if
[02:44:18.880 --> 02:44:23.880]  the evidence is there, they need to be convicted. If the evidence is not there, then they need
[02:44:23.880 --> 02:44:25.880]  to be cleared of all charges and released.
[02:44:25.880 --> 02:44:31.880]  Well, I think the idea of, well, listen, I think the idea of an info war operation where
[02:44:31.880 --> 02:44:36.120]  we write up a treatise saying we know you're criminal, we know about the takeover, listing
[02:44:36.120 --> 02:44:40.880]  the UN running our military, listing the treaties and say you have, you know, three months till
[02:44:40.880 --> 02:44:45.760]  this date, this is just hypothetical folks, I'm not saying do this, I'm just brainstorming
[02:44:45.760 --> 02:44:50.280]  this, wargaming it, to either announce that you're with the republic and want to be part
[02:44:50.280 --> 02:44:56.480]  of a plan to reorganize the country again and kick out the Vichy French collaborators
[02:44:56.480 --> 02:45:01.360]  basically is the analogy, or you're going to be considered part of it. You send them
[02:45:01.360 --> 02:45:05.720]  a notice letter and you have everybody with petitions with millions on the White House
[02:45:05.720 --> 02:45:11.680]  dot gov and everyone sending thousands of letters per congressperson over and over again a day
[02:45:11.680 --> 02:45:16.560]  and going to Congress and going to their local office and making it a movement to say, trader,
[02:45:16.560 --> 02:45:20.360]  trader, trader, you either admit we've been taken over by the foreign fellow reserve,
[02:45:20.360 --> 02:45:24.360]  you either denounce it and say you're going to kick the globalist out, or you're going
[02:45:24.360 --> 02:45:25.360]  to be considered part of it.
[02:45:25.360 --> 02:45:30.400]  I think they have to be put on notice that they are part of the criminal program and
[02:45:30.400 --> 02:45:33.680]  they need to declare where they stand because I mean, what are we going to arrest? Walter
[02:45:33.680 --> 02:45:40.280]  Jones, are we going to arrest Rand Paul, are we going to arrest Ted Cruz, Amash, are we
[02:45:40.280 --> 02:45:44.880]  going to, I mean, there's a lot of good people up there that are talking just like us saying
[02:45:44.880 --> 02:45:51.400]  the globalist are scary, Obama's scary, we're going into a dictatorship. That's the thing
[02:45:51.400 --> 02:45:56.920]  about revolutions. The globalist are revolutionaries, we're restorationists or counter-revolutionaries,
[02:45:56.920 --> 02:46:01.440]  that's what they call us actually. They know we're the good guys and so the danger of a
[02:46:01.440 --> 02:46:08.080]  revolution is most of the time you get something worse when you've overthrown the last system.
[02:46:08.080 --> 02:46:13.800]  To see the last system is vestiges of the old republic that wasn't perfect but light
[02:46:13.800 --> 02:46:19.680]  years better than globalism with globalism overlaid. So it's a very sophisticated situation
[02:46:19.680 --> 02:46:22.280]  and I'm glad we're debating it, but go ahead.
[02:46:22.280 --> 02:46:34.040]  You just said before you got me on that we're two minutes to midnight. We are out of time.
[02:46:34.040 --> 02:46:41.360]  We don't have time to go through the bureaucratic red tape and get this done the way that it
[02:46:41.360 --> 02:46:42.680]  could be done.
[02:46:42.680 --> 02:46:48.560]  I hear you, I know, it's really bad. I mean, they're on TV saying communism's good and
[02:46:48.560 --> 02:46:52.680]  our kids belong to them and every awards show they're having satanic ceremonies and I'm
[02:46:52.680 --> 02:46:56.520]  living in a twilight zone movie. I mean, they're putting cancer viruses and all the major vaccines
[02:46:56.520 --> 02:47:00.440]  that put fluoride in the water that brain damages people on record. They're just it's
[02:47:00.440 --> 02:47:05.960]  total crazy land and what do you do when you're faced with an elite that is so evil and the
[02:47:05.960 --> 02:47:06.960]  public so naive?
[02:47:06.960 --> 02:47:11.720]  I think the biggest thing is all the yuppies and sitcom watchers. We got to somehow reach
[02:47:11.720 --> 02:47:17.480]  out to them with banner hangs and stunts and calling into talk radio and, you know, all
[02:47:17.480 --> 02:47:21.600]  the talk show hosts that make fun of me and I appreciate your call, sir. Great points.
[02:47:21.600 --> 02:47:28.040]  I mean, I tune in sometimes to you want answers. I think I'm entitled. You want the truth.
[02:47:28.040 --> 02:47:30.160]  You can't handle the truth.
[02:47:30.160 --> 02:47:35.720]  That's what it comes down to. Maybe we should play that one more time because I think it
[02:47:35.720 --> 02:47:41.920]  says it all for the general public answer the question. You want answers. I think I'm entitled.
[02:47:41.920 --> 02:47:48.680]  You want answers. I want the truth. You can't handle the truth. Son, we live in a world
[02:47:48.680 --> 02:47:53.000]  that has walls and those walls have to be guarded by men with guns. Who's going to do
[02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:59.640]  it? You? You, Lieutenant Weinberg? I have a greater responsibility than you can possibly
[02:47:59.640 --> 02:48:06.160]  fathom. You weep for Santiago and you curse the Marines. You have that luxury. You have
[02:48:06.160 --> 02:48:11.680]  the luxury of not knowing what I know that Santiago's death while tragic probably saved
[02:48:11.680 --> 02:48:20.960]  lives and my existence while grotesque and incomprehensible to you saves lives.
[02:48:20.960 --> 02:48:25.640]  My issue is, is the public ready for the truth? I mean, this show is the truth. We really
[02:48:25.640 --> 02:48:29.760]  know what we're talking about. We understand the enemy's operations. We know what makes
[02:48:29.760 --> 02:48:35.120]  some tick. And you either get what the enemy's saying and understand what we're facing or
[02:48:35.120 --> 02:48:41.960]  we're going to lose everything. The globalists come from different elites that have merged
[02:48:41.960 --> 02:48:45.640]  together for thousands of years that have manipulated humans and have to stain for
[02:48:45.640 --> 02:48:51.440]  the public. You can't do the things they do to people and not have a hatred of the average
[02:48:51.440 --> 02:48:57.040]  man or woman. That's why they see the veterans as total dogs as total scum. And then they
[02:48:57.040 --> 02:49:02.360]  want to lure young people into joining so they can chew up the best and brightest and
[02:49:02.360 --> 02:49:11.320]  use them to create this whole new world order.
[02:49:11.320 --> 02:49:15.960]  Let's go to Alan and then Eric and then Michael and Barbara. You're on the air Alan, Army
[02:49:15.960 --> 02:49:20.280]  Vet as well. No other vets, just Army Vets calling. Alan, what's your take on the VA?
[02:49:20.280 --> 02:49:23.440]  Yes, sir. Good to speak with you. How are you doing, brother?
[02:49:23.440 --> 02:49:24.440]  Doing all right.
[02:49:24.440 --> 02:49:32.160]  Yeah. Well, I was stationed for years active duty out there in your backyard at Fort Hood.
[02:49:32.160 --> 02:49:38.960]  And I'm 27 now and I got out about three years ago and I moved back home to Georgia and went
[02:49:38.960 --> 02:49:48.360]  to the Atlanta VA. And when I first heard the scandal, I didn't see anything like that
[02:49:48.360 --> 02:49:53.920]  personally because I got out of there. But let me tell you, it's creepy. When you pull
[02:49:53.920 --> 02:50:01.440]  in the parking lot there, you just get a feeling of how bad it is. And luckily, like
[02:50:01.440 --> 02:50:06.680]  I said, I'm 27. So for the younger guys, they can't just, you know, they can't just
[02:50:06.680 --> 02:50:13.280]  kill us. But man, you know, these Vietnam guys, the older generation, man, they're really
[02:50:13.280 --> 02:50:19.720]  sticking there. And it's like you just see them. It's so bad. I felt so bad for them.
[02:50:19.720 --> 02:50:25.440]  And they're just struggling. And then the younger guys, like us, the ones that do get
[02:50:25.440 --> 02:50:32.720]  an appointment as soon as they sit you down. First thing, let's ask you about your guns.
[02:50:32.720 --> 02:50:39.080]  Second thing, we want to go ahead and first bribe all the anti psychotic, you know, things
[02:50:39.080 --> 02:50:44.120]  like that. So luckily, I have a, I don't go there anymore.
[02:50:44.120 --> 02:50:48.120]  Stay there. I want to hear about this when we come back. Makes me hate these globalists
[02:50:48.120 --> 02:50:53.480]  so much. They are the most cowardly degenerate filth on the planet. And they absolutely hate
[02:50:53.480 --> 02:50:57.640]  veterans. I want you to hear that folks. They want you dead. You understand that? I'll be

[02:54:11.040 --> 02:54:15.800]  People should go to veterans events that the media is covering tomorrow and make a scene
[02:54:15.800 --> 02:54:19.520]  about the VA and what they're doing and say, we're not going to let you just trot out the
[02:54:19.520 --> 02:54:26.040]  vets and act like America's great. America's occupied by globalists and we're not going
[02:54:26.040 --> 02:54:32.400]  to let you use them anymore when you hate their stinking guts. I mean, that's what it
[02:54:32.400 --> 02:54:35.760]  comes down to. I mean, it'd be one thing if they were throwing the vets in the trash and
[02:54:35.760 --> 02:54:41.080]  treating them like crap. That makes me mad. But the grandstanding and how much they love
[02:54:41.080 --> 02:54:51.240]  them and it's so sick. And the VA are just hell pits. It used to be bad. Now it is just,
[02:54:51.240 --> 02:54:53.920]  I mean, I talked to a lot of the guys that work here, veterans, and they just talk about
[02:54:53.920 --> 02:54:58.280]  how badly they're treated and how they'll be an old man or something going, I'm hurting,
[02:54:58.280 --> 02:55:02.720]  I'm hurting. All like big guys going, watch it, old man. You know, I mean, I'm not saying
[02:55:02.720 --> 02:55:06.840]  I'm a tough guy, folks, but I mean, I would blow up if I saw stuff like that. And then
[02:55:06.840 --> 02:55:11.320]  we were just talking to Allen in Georgia. He was taught and we're going to go to overdrive
[02:55:11.320 --> 02:55:15.240]  and talk to Michelle, Kathy and Eric, at least, about how they asked about your guns. Yeah,
[02:55:15.240 --> 02:55:19.200]  what about those guns? You crazy? What you planning? And what they do to the vets, they're
[02:55:19.200 --> 02:55:25.120]  going to do to everybody else now. What they do to people in their clutches is a beta test
[02:55:25.120 --> 02:55:32.120]  for you and I. And I am sick of it. So finish up your points, Allen.
[02:55:32.120 --> 02:55:36.560]  Well, yeah, a few more quick points and I know you got to take some other calls. I wasn't
[02:55:36.560 --> 02:55:43.640]  gonna mention it. I was mainly talking about when I got out, but I went to Iraq in 2006
[02:55:43.640 --> 02:55:49.040]  and also 2008. And I want to say that when I was on hold, I was listening to your other
[02:55:49.040 --> 02:55:55.800]  callers and I'm also, and you're right, I'm very concerned about the number of shots
[02:55:55.800 --> 02:56:04.000]  that I had to take and particularly the anthrax. I'm concerned about future possible, you know,
[02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:13.440]  outside effects from that. It's pretty scary stuff. But yeah, going back to the VA, basically,
[02:56:13.440 --> 02:56:19.040]  if you don't see the, which I mean, you called it to, you know, we all kind of saw it coming
[02:56:19.040 --> 02:56:22.640]  when they first broke it. But if you don't see, of course, they're going to be all over
[02:56:22.640 --> 02:56:30.160]  the country, but I almost guarantee the Atlanta VA was also a part of this. And real quick,
[02:56:30.160 --> 02:56:35.960]  you know, the bigger picture, I think you hit the nail on the head these past few days.
[02:56:35.960 --> 02:56:40.480]  Of course, they're targeting veterans, you know, and the healthcare thing is bad enough,
[02:56:40.480 --> 02:56:47.360]  sir. But if people really knew that they took, they were taking it a step further like you,
[02:56:47.360 --> 02:56:53.600]  like you put on air and calling us domestic terrorists, that's just even more of a slap
[02:56:53.600 --> 02:57:00.000]  in the face. And I really appreciate you putting it out there because, you know, the
[02:57:00.000 --> 02:57:05.680]  only reason the VA healthcare scandal is on any mainstream media now is no thanks to them,
[02:57:05.680 --> 02:57:08.560]  it's thanks to you and then the other alternative media.
[02:57:08.560 --> 02:57:12.560]  Well, yeah, we weren't really on top of the VA thing like everybody else. I've been on it for
[02:57:12.560 --> 02:57:17.200]  years, but it was alternative and libertarian and conservative radio that forced it out there.
[02:57:18.080 --> 02:57:22.000]  But to see Bill Press and Sharpton make jokes about it, I mean, I'm just sick of these people,
[02:57:22.000 --> 02:57:28.880]  man. Just because they have a lisping voice and pink ties and act trendy and act effeminate
[02:57:28.880 --> 02:57:33.920]  doesn't mean that they're intellectual or good people. And I'm just sick of all of them.
[02:57:33.920 --> 02:57:39.440]  We're like ruled by a bunch of fake Nellies that behind the scenes are just raving evil demons.
[02:57:39.440 --> 02:57:43.200]  I appreciate you calling, God bless you. We're going to come back and jam in as many calls as we

[03:00:28.160 --> 03:00:42.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now transmitting worldwide in overdrive. We're going to get
[03:00:42.880 --> 03:00:47.360]  to many of these veteran calls that we can, Navy vets and others. And I've kind of gone
[03:00:47.360 --> 03:00:53.440]  slow here, I apologize. Let's go quick. Michael in FEMA Region 9, that's on the West Coast
[03:00:53.440 --> 03:00:58.560]  somewhere, formerly part of the US. What is your experience with the VA?
[03:01:00.240 --> 03:01:08.000]  Alex, I'm employed by the VA. I clean toilets and showers and tubs for veterans. And my personal
[03:01:08.000 --> 03:01:12.400]  experience is, you know, I've had a lot of long wait times and this and that, but I've got my eyes
[03:01:12.400 --> 03:01:17.840]  open and I'm awake. And if I see anything wrong going on, I'm going to bring it to attention.
[03:01:17.840 --> 03:01:24.560]  What my concern is, is my son, who you kind of hit on this a couple of collars ago. He's got a
[03:01:24.560 --> 03:01:32.240]  full-ride scholarship at a university back in North Carolina. He was ROTC head of commander of his
[03:01:32.240 --> 03:01:38.480]  high school as a junior and a senior. He's got a full-ride and he wants to get a four-year degree
[03:01:38.480 --> 03:01:43.280]  in criminal justice. And I asked him, I said, are you going to be a cop? And he kind of chuckled
[03:01:43.280 --> 03:01:47.440]  and said, I don't know, maybe pops. I said, well, if you're going to be a cop, be a good cop. But
[03:01:47.440 --> 03:01:52.320]  then he wants to get an 82nd airborne. I just, I'm trying to expose to him. Well, I think it'd be
[03:01:52.320 --> 03:01:56.160]  great to join the military, even though they go on some evil missions, because we need good people
[03:01:56.160 --> 03:02:02.080]  in the military if they weren't giving them experimental vaccines. I think no one should
[03:02:02.080 --> 03:02:06.720]  join the military. We should make it a big political issue that they're still doing experimentation on
[03:02:06.720 --> 03:02:12.080]  them. And people say, well, they don't have rights. They're troops. No, federal law says you can't
[03:02:12.080 --> 03:02:17.680]  give troops experimental vaccines. It's illegal. And that's how we got the anthrax shots stopped
[03:02:17.680 --> 03:02:25.040]  twice and a bunch of others. So an info wars was at the forefront of that. And I'm proud of that.
[03:02:25.760 --> 03:02:28.880]  Because let me tell you, they can make the troops take shots. They can make us take shots.
[03:02:29.440 --> 03:02:33.840]  So we're all in this together. God bless you, Michael. I don't know. It'd be better for him to
[03:02:33.840 --> 03:02:39.040]  be a cop than in the 82nd airborne. I mean, they just, I mean, they'll automatic re-up him. They
[03:02:39.040 --> 03:02:45.440]  will use him like birdcage liner. So I would never do that. I understand he wants to be a warrior.
[03:02:45.440 --> 03:02:52.480]  He's a man. He wants to be challenged. He wants to show his metal. But it's just they treat you
[03:02:52.480 --> 03:03:00.480]  like pure crap. Let's talk to Eric in Texas. You're on the air. Go ahead. Hey, Jay. Hey, buddy.
[03:03:00.480 --> 03:03:06.880]  Army vet, go ahead. Tell us your take on it. I'm gonna blow my whistle out, partner. Look here,
[03:03:06.880 --> 03:03:13.520]  I had the anthrax shot before I went to the desert storm back in 1990. Now, after the war,
[03:03:13.520 --> 03:03:20.720]  we got taken out to the destroyed tanks. I saw the T-72s laying in the battlefield. Now, I'm here
[03:03:20.720 --> 03:03:30.400]  to ask why were we taken to a site that was very possibly destroyed by our depleted uranium shells
[03:03:30.400 --> 03:03:35.440]  at the M1A1, which I worked on, shoot down rain. That's right. You weren't supposed to be around
[03:03:35.440 --> 03:03:41.520]  those. Dr. Doug Rocky was there. Most of his team died. I never have got an answer. I do have a letter
[03:03:41.520 --> 03:03:48.560]  from DoD, though, from 2000 that says if I was with my unit on the day specified, I probably was
[03:03:48.560 --> 03:03:58.960]  exposed to chemical fallout, possibly due to the munitions being burned in Iraq. Another key
[03:03:58.960 --> 03:04:06.640]  point here, I used to go to Austin VA, but now I go to Temple VA, and they don't diagnose PTSD.
[03:04:06.640 --> 03:04:13.520]  It's a big no-no. The director of the somewhere up in the chain put out the memo and said,
[03:04:13.520 --> 03:04:22.640]  you don't diagnose that. You diagnose anxiety, depression, irritability, and all these symptoms,
[03:04:22.640 --> 03:04:29.360]  but PTSD is off the books because it costs too much money. Austin American Statesman did an article
[03:04:29.360 --> 03:04:37.920]  on that, which I believe I still have a copy of it. Incredible, sir. Look, I'm sorry to all
[03:04:37.920 --> 03:04:42.480]  the other vets. We'll do this again tomorrow. Barbara, Kathy, and John, if you give folks your
[03:04:42.480 --> 03:04:48.400]  number, we'll call you tomorrow, I promise. Or if you get back in and go to the head of the line,
[03:04:48.400 --> 03:04:54.080]  I'm out of time. Nightly News tonight, 7. The good news is major attention's on the VA now.
[03:04:54.080 --> 03:05:19.440]  We may be able to get some reforms if people stay angry.
