[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.240]  Can you please give me a few scientific papers that prove human emissions of carbon dioxide
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.040]  drive global warming?
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:26.280]  No one can show from the scientific literature that human emissions of carbon dioxide drive
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.480]  global warming.
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.640]  Climate change is too abstract for people to understand, but the coming water crisis
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.480]  is something that everybody will get on board with.
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.960]  From Malaysia to Mexico, from Sri Lanka to Singapore, privatization is on the move.
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.200]  They're restricting water supplies all over the planet.
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.360]  They've passed legislation to take pure aquifer water all over Canada, the US, England, Europe,
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.160]  you name it, and put it through a bunch of chemical processors to poison the living hell
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:01.880]  out of it, and to give it way more expensive pricing to then make the cost of water go
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:02.880]  up.
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.640]  Water has always been free in the UK, they live on a giant crystal clear aquifer, now
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.760]  they're starting to charge for it.
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.960]  This is how they operate, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.480]  One of the biggest experiments in water privatization has taken place in the UK.
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:24.120]  In 1989, the government sold off the entire water system of England and Wales to limited
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.120]  companies.
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:31.360]  More than 30 years later, that system is being criticized across the political spectrum.
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:37.440]  Chief executives have been awarded hefty pay packages, shareholders generous dividends,
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.280]  and investment in infrastructure has not kept pace with population growth, leading to sewage
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.720]  flooding and pollution failures.
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:52.160]  Just 14% of rivers meet the minimum European standards for water quality, for example.
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.920]  The global government is failing, they create the crises or exacerbate the problems, those
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.920]  are the saviors.
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:06.000]  When problems arise in the Sahel, or even in Texas, or anywhere else, it's not because
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.720]  something went wrong in that local area, it's because something is going wrong globally.
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.120]  Something went wrong globally.
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.560]  So we've got to address this at the global level.
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.720]  This is about investing in global common, the global commons, for the common good of
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.720]  all.
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.120]  And that word common good is actually a radical word.
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.640]  Because in economics, we have notions of the public good, it sounds good, because the second
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.640]  word is good.
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.880]  But it's really framed more as a correction for something the private sector is not doing.
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.900]  That's also of course, true with COVID, right?
[00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.980]  We are all only as healthy as our neighbors on our street and our city, and our region
[00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.360]  and our nation and globally.
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.360]  Did we solve that?
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.160]  Did we actually manage to vaccinate everyone in the world?
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.160]  No.
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.240]  So highlighting water as a global commons and what it means to work together and see
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.840]  it both out of that kind of global commons perspective, but also the self interest perspective,
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.240]  because it is, it does have that parallel.
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.360]  It's not only important, but it's also important because we haven't managed to solve those
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.200]  problems with which had similar attributes and water is something that people understand.
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.880]  You know, climate change is a bit abstract.
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.520]  Some people understand it really well.
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.600]  Some understand it a bit.
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.120]  Some just don't understand it.
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.000]  Water, every kid knows how important it is to have water when you're playing football
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]  and you're thirsty, you need water.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.680]  So there's also something about really getting citizen engagement around this and really,
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.640]  in some ways experimenting with this notion of the common good.
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.840]  Can we actually deliver this time in ways that we have failed miserably?
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.160]  They're admitting they're bringing in global currencies that are already here, already
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.160]  running China.
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.200]  They tried it in Nigeria, now it's massively backfired, they're pulling it out there.
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.320]  But it just devastates economies, but it consolidates power.
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.720]  Remember those headlines?
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.240]  Workers lost 3.7 trillion in earnings during the pandemic, the plandemic.
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.840]  World's billionaires get richer by 3.9 trillion during the pandemic, more than doubling their
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:57.840]  wealth.
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:04.320]  Yet in 2016, the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee found that Ofwat were too generous.
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:11.160]  And as a result, water companies made windfall gains of at least 1.2 billion between 2010
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.120]  and 2015, from bills being higher than necessary.
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.000]  What happens in one part of the world ends up in another part of the world that's intrinsic
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.040]  to the climate crisis and water is intertwined with that climate crisis.
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.400]  And honestly, we have a common language on climate, but we don't have that on water.
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:36.280]  And that's, that's in my view, that is exactly what we need to have in order to progress towards
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.280]  a common goal.
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.680]  And so what's happening is the general public and people in the government and big talk
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.160]  show hosts across the board realize that they're being targeted too, no matter how rich and
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.160]  powerful you are.
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.880]  If you're not in the inner club, you're being targeted and the globalists get blowbacked
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:51.880]  themselves.
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:52.880]  They get hurt by their own attacks.
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:53.880]  It's insane.
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.560]  It's satanic.
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:01.440]  It's crazy.
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.960]  Where were you when humanity was fighting for its life?
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.800]  Where were you when the globalists were caught trafficking millions of children for sex slavery
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.160]  worldwide?
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.120]  Where were you when the new world order was starting world war three with Russia?
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.640]  Well, I know where you are.
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:20.080]  You're watching and listening to Infowars.com right now, and I salute you and thank you.
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.720]  And I want to encourage all of you who've been in this fight so long to realize we've
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.720]  reached the critical juncture in the battle now.
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.640]  And a key tool in that fight is the great awakening, defeating the globalists and launching
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.720]  the next great renaissance.
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.380]  This is my second book, part two of the great recent war for the world.
[00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.980]  It's a longer book, quite frankly, more powerful book.
[00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.540]  And just like the last book went to number one, it is up to you to sense the number one
[00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:45.540]  right now.
[00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.380]  This is a cultural fight against the globalists and it funds the info war.
[00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:55.380]  Get signed or unsigned copies of the great awakening right now at Infowars.com.
[00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:56.980]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:58.460]  This is a book everybody needs.
[00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.220]  Get your copy of the great awakening right now.
[00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.100]  Infowars, tomorrow's news today.
[00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:35.340]  Freedom of Information Act results have shown that the American College of Obstetricians
[00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:43.460]  and Gynecologists knew that the mRNA injections were commonly fatal to babies in the womb.
[00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:50.420]  And $11 million was spent to bribe OBGYNs to lie to pregnant women about the safety
[00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:54.260]  of the injections and convince them to get the shot.
[00:06:55.060 --> 00:07:03.060]  U.S. nursing home data clearly shows that the mRNA shots were killing the elderly.
[00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:07.300]  The mRNA shots are now causing cancer.
[00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:15.700]  The CDC admits at least 118,000 children have died suddenly in the USA since the rollout
[00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:18.340]  of the mRNA COVID vaccines.
[00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:23.340]  The actual count is likely much higher, and that was reported a year ago.
[00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:25.460]  Nothing has really changed.
[00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:31.660]  The historical mass murder continues, and the perpetrators remain free, pushing for
[00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:35.780]  round two and winning the Nobel Peace Prize.
[00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:40.420]  Their discovery led to a monumental medical breakthrough, but even they were surprised
[00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:45.100]  when they learned today they're receiving one of the world's most prestigious awards.
[00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:49.340]  The Nobel Prize in Medicine, the last thing a pair of scientists expected when the phone
[00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:51.500]  rang at 3.40 this morning.
[00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:55.980]  My husband picked up and he was talking to somebody and then he just handed over and
[00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:58.500]  said this is for you.
[00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.220]  Did you believe it at first?
[00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:04.540]  Not really, you know, because, you know, people can make jokes.
[00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:09.340]  I also thought it was a prank or an anti-vaxxer joke or something.
[00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:11.300]  This has to be a prank.
[00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:17.580]  Some anti-vaxxer is, you know, playing with us and, you know, this can't be real.
[00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:20.880]  We wait and the press conference starts and it was real.
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:25.960]  We couldn't get funding, we couldn't get publications, we couldn't get really people
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:29.840]  to notice RNA as something interesting.
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:34.800]  It had failed clinical trials and pretty much everybody gave up on it.
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:37.960]  I mean, everybody was skeptical, but we didn't care.
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:44.520]  Katie and I certainly didn't go into science for money or for awards.
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:49.520]  We did it because of interest and curiosity.
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:54.440]  We've got clinical trials for seven vaccines going on right now.
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:09:02.320]  We've got work on cancer vaccines, vaccines for autoimmune diseases, for allergies.
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:06.800]  We've got gene therapy moving into clinical development.
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.760]  We've got a variety of therapeutics.
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:17.600]  So it's already been going on for many years and this has just given RNA the recognition.
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.480]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:45.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, we cannot just oppose the globalists and their operations.
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:50.640]  Yes, it's important to expose them, to track their criminal operations, their depopulation,
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.040]  their pedophilia, their satanic agenda.
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:59.920]  But we also need to then offer our own agenda, our own plan for the future.
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:05.840]  Unlike them, we're not going to make people via totalitarian systems follow our agenda,
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:10.400]  but we should promote an alternate agenda to what they're doing.
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:17.360]  In this book that came out in 2022, there came a number one worldwide bestseller,
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.120]  The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:22.640]  We lay out the enemy's own statements, their own plans.
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.280]  It is the blueprints to the Death Star.
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:29.360]  And that book is available signed or unsigned at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:34.240]  But now we're talking about the new book, The Great Awakening.
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:41.280]  The Great Awakening, defeating the globalists and launching the next great renaissance.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.200]  And that's what this book does.
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.520]  It is 400 pages long.
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:51.120]  I would say that 60% of it is the latest enemy operations and how they're operating and
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:54.560]  what makes them tick and how to stop them.
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:00.400]  But then 40% or so is what we can build.
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:06.880]  Different ideas, different systems to counter the dystopia that they are setting up.
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:09.040]  Now, we're going to send this to number one.
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:10.640]  You're going to send this to number one.
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:12.480]  They are so pissed about this book.
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:13.520]  They're already attacking it.
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:18.560]  But I want to encourage all of you to go to InfoWarsStore.com and get a signed copy.
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.840]  That's a fundraiser to keep us on air and historical memento.
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.320]  And also get unsigned copies.
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.640]  Give your friends, your family, and your neighbors.
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:32.480]  Because this book is a major piece of history.
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:36.320]  So let me go over some of what's in the book.
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.920]  We'll go ahead and go to an overhead shot.
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.120]  I'll show you the back of the book.
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:44.160]  A Tucker Carlson quote, a Bill Maher quote, a Joe Rogan quote, a Stephen K Manning quote,
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:45.520]  a Mickey Willis quote.
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:47.680]  And these quotes are absolutely dead on.
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:51.520]  Tucker Carlson says, Alex Jones is often mocked for his flamboyance.
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:55.920]  But the truth is, he's been far better guide to reality in recent years.
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:00.560]  In other words, a far better journalist than, say, NBC News.
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.880]  Bill Maher, Alex Jones gets to speak.
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:03.920]  Everybody gets to speak.
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:05.840]  Here's Joe Rogan.
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:08.960]  Alex Jones is one of the most misunderstood people in the world.
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:11.840]  And he's been right about a lot of SH-T.
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:17.760]  Stephen K Manning, for more than 20 years, no populist figure has been more of a bayonet
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:19.920]  in the back of the deep state than Alex Jones.
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:22.960]  Stephen K Manning, who also wrote the forward to the book.
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:27.840]  Mickey Willis, award-winning documentary filmmaker, reaches hundreds of millions.
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:30.560]  Mainstream media is wrong the vast majority of the time.
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:32.240]  Yet they are never held accountable.
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.400]  Alex Jones is right the vast majority of the time.
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:36.960]  And yet he is silenced and persecuted.
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.720]  The book, ladies and gentlemen, is unbelievable.
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:46.320]  And it was researched by the great researcher Kent Hechen-Lively, who double-checked everything
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:48.640]  I said, who fact-checked it all.
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:57.440]  It has a big document section in the back where we show you everywhere the sources come from.
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:03.440]  You need The Great Awakening, defeating the globalists and launching the next great renaissance
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:06.320]  today with the forward by Stephen K Manning.
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:11.040]  Let's go to a document cam shot and give people a first look at this book.
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:13.680]  There's The Great Awakening.
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:15.920]  And it goes into the chapters.
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.600]  Forward by Stephen Manning.
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:18.960]  Bayonet to the back of the Deep State.
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.760]  Chapter 1, the threat of artificial intelligence.
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:25.040]  Chapter 2, Mao is in charge of the Democratic Party.
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:28.000]  And political violence is bad, except when it's directed at Alex Jones.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.800]  Chapter 3, you're being modified against your will.
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.880]  That's the GMO, genetic engineering.
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:37.120]  Chapter 4, they want you to be a teenager on an allowance.
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:41.440]  And that's just the beginning, the social credit score, the ESGs.
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.600]  Chapter 5, the eternal war of tyrants.
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.440]  Chapter 6, the war machine.
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:47.840]  Chapter 7, the Deep State makes its move.
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:50.960]  Chapter 8, the education of Tucker Carlson, Joe Rogan and others.
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.960]  That's the big inside baseball section.
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:53.840]  Very powerful.
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:55.280]  Chapter 9, Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:57.760]  Ren filled with the globalists, Dracula's.
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:00.240]  But even worse, because they prey on their own children.
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.560]  They murder their own children and drink their blood.
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:03.280]  Totally proven.
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:04.320]  I name names.
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:05.600]  You cannot make this up.
[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:09.040]  Chapter 10, the COVID lies and deception.
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:11.920]  Chapter 11, selling your soul to Hollywood and the CIA.
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:14.320]  Chapter 12, combat tactics for victory.
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.000]  Chapter 13, the final battle.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.680]  Conclusion, how you know you're winning and more.
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:23.920]  The Great Awakening, exclusively available at infowarestore.com.
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:25.280]  A piece of history.

[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:32.240]  inform yourself and wake up friends, family, neighbors.

[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.040]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:46.560]  I have been really doing research for this broadcast today.
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:49.120]  And I had a bunch of big developments happen right before I went live on air.
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:52.480]  So I heard some of those new, very powerful, informative special reports.
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:54.800]  And that breakdown of the new book, The Great Awakening,
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:57.840]  defeating the globalists and launching the next great renaissance.
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:01.360]  The book is now available signed and unsigned at infowarestore.com.
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:02.880]  It ships on the 20th.
[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:04.160]  It is in our warehouse.
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:05.600]  Be the first to get it.
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.120]  It is powerful.
[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:09.200]  And it's needed to keep us on air.
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.840]  Thank you so much for your support.
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:12.320]  All right.
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:14.720]  Obviously, we're going to get into the removal of Kevin McCarthy and
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:17.760]  how big a deal that is and why it's very positive,
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:20.000]  despite some of the naysayers out there that I understand.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.040]  They say, well, what do we do next?
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:22.800]  Well, we don't do what we were doing before.
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:28.800]  Cry havoc and let loose the dogs of war, to quote William Shakespeare.
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:30.480]  Justice be done, may the heavens fall.
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.920]  And then we've got an incredible new interview with
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:38.240]  a top historian with Tucker Carlson I'm going to get to that's so powerful,
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:40.560]  Mr. Hansen.
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:44.560]  And we've got just massive poison shot news,
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:49.440]  huge expansions of the second rollout of the COVID protocols, all confirmed.
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:50.400]  It's now official.
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:52.720]  And so much more today.
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:56.560]  Thank you for joining us on this October 4th, Wednesday, 2023 transmission.
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:57.360]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.120]  Last year, we put this book out,
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:05.360]  The Great Reset in the War for the World.
[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:07.680]  It became a number one national bestseller.
[00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:11.440]  Now we've put part two out and it's even thicker and more powerful.
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:16.720]  The Great Awakening, the plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:18.720]  This is such a powerful book.
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:22.400]  It covers all the globalist plans, the latest developments,
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:27.680]  how to stop them and then gives an alternate plan of a society we could build together.
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:29.200]  That's why it's The Great Awakening.
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:31.520]  The Great Awakening is happening right now.
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:36.640]  You can get signed or unsigned copies of the book at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:38.320]  This is a historic book.
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:40.240]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:44.080]  This is next level information and it's a great way to not just support the broadcast,
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:47.920]  but inform yourself to the next level and share the book with friends and family.
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:50.240]  So whether you want one copy or multiple copies,
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:54.560]  go now to InfoWarsTore.com and get The Great Awakening.
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:56.000]  This is going to go to number one.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.280]  I want to thank you for your support.
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:58.320]  It's a powerful book.
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:59.360]  Get yours now.
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:04.160]  We have not had this many of our bestselling products back in stock in years
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:07.600]  because of supply chain breakdowns and all the rest of stuff that's gone on.
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:09.120]  And these are game-changing products.
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:10.960]  It's like our information is game-changing.
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:12.320]  These products are incredible.
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:15.760]  And I'm personally glad that these are now back in stock.
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:21.840]  All three of the InfoWars Platinum flagship products that have been sold out for months
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:27.600]  are now back in stock, but a very limited run because we only had a budget to get
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:31.120]  three or 4,000 bottles of each one of these.
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:35.600]  We've got 4,000 bottles of the HGH Max Boost that people love so much.
[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:40.960]  We've got about 4,000 bottles of 1776 Testosterone Boost that just came in.
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:46.960]  And we've got about 3,000 bottles of Pain MD, an incredible natural pain reliever situation.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.160]  All three of these are back in stock,
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:54.720]  and they're incredible, and they fund our operation at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:58.880]  Have you tried taking the Real Red Pill?
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:04.880]  A one-of-a-kind heart and brain formula designed exclusively for InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:09.760]  One of the most powerful ingredients in the Real Red Pill Plus is pregnenolone.
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:12.480]  Pregnenolone levels decrease with age,
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:17.600]  and low levels are associated with fatigue, low brain function, and unhealthy aging.
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:22.880]  The Real Red Pill Plus also provides a high level of anti-inflammatory properties.
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:26.720]  The Real Red Pill Plus also provides essential trace minerals,
[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:30.640]  such as vitamin B12, calcium, copper, and zinc.
[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:35.360]  Featuring naturally occurring L-theanine, caffeine, and theobromine,
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:41.040]  the energy blend inside the Real Red Pill Plus provides an extra pick-me-up for your day
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:43.840]  that goes beyond the second cup of coffee.
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:50.480]  So visit InfoWarsTore.com, go down the rabbit hole, and try taking the Real Red Pill.
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:56.000]  Now 25% off for a limited time at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:00.960]  Hey everybody, Rodney Altbrown here.
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:06.240]  I want to thank Alex Jones and InfoWars for offering scholarships to River University.
[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:09.120]  Maybe you're watching InfoWars today,
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:13.840]  and you don't know what to do with the problems that we face in the world today.
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:18.480]  You've been through COVID-19, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023.
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:23.200]  But here at River University, not only do we show you what the problem is,
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.280]  but we show you how to deal with it.
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:32.640]  Come, a full three-year bachelor degree will train you up in ministry, government, worship,
[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:36.800]  that you can go out and actually bring about a transformation in the earth today.
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:41.120]  We have graduates going all over the world from the Arctic to the outback.
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:43.360]  And right here, this is what we do.
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:48.960]  We specialize in training people and equipping them for transformation.
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:50.160]  And that's what you'll do.
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:54.880]  So scan the QR code right now or go to riveruniversity.org

[00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:08.160]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:23.700]  You know, I don't like to sit here and play long clips of other people's shows, but sometimes
[00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:26.900]  when something's so true, so powerful, you have to do it.
[00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:32.380]  It's a 33 minute, 27 second interview with Victor Davis Hanson, one of the top historians
[00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:36.860]  of the country.
[00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:39.940]  And I'm going to air a big piece of it next segment.
[00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:42.300]  It's so dead on.
[00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:44.260]  And then I'll continue with all the news and information.
[00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:51.020]  But first, let's get into Kev McCarthy's ouster as the Speaker of the House yesterday, throwing
[00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:52.940]  the House into turmoil.
[00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:59.500]  Well, we were already going in a direction of him going back on every promise he made.
[00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:06.460]  And the people saw him, the Republicans that voted him in nine months ago, saw him doing
[00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:12.500]  record six week vacations and stuff when he could have had one week vacations.
[00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:17.260]  And the Republicans have a limited two year window to really prove themselves and unseat
[00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:18.460]  the Democrats.
[00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:21.200]  They could have cut funding to the Justice Department.
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:25.260]  They could have gone after the corrupt FBI that needs to be reformed or abolished.
[00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:28.060]  I don't think most FBI agents in the world I hear agree with that.
[00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:30.740]  I mean, it's the leadership's completely controlled.
[00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:31.740]  It's hijacked.
[00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:32.740]  It's compromised.
[00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:33.860]  It's captured.
[00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:35.860]  And so I really respect Matt Gaetz.
[00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:36.860]  They tried to set him up.
[00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:38.700]  It was all made up.
[00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:44.620]  He's been, of course, validated and vindicated and proven to be innocent of supposedly a
[00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:48.360]  17 year old girl years ago and all the rest of this garbage.
[00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:51.700]  So I think he should be the speaker.
[00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:54.060]  Obviously, he's not going to get the votes for that.
[00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:58.140]  But he gave a big group of speeches to the media yesterday.
[00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:00.140]  I've got like 20 minutes of it.
[00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:01.140]  All of it's powerful.
[00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:03.740]  But in so many of the interviews they start with, aren't you a narcissist making it all
[00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:04.740]  about you?
[00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:06.240]  How dare you do this?
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:07.940]  McCarthy promised to do these things.
[00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:10.920]  He didn't do one of them.
[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:12.340]  And so we gave McCarthy time.
[00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:14.540]  I said, let's see what he does.
[00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:15.540]  And he didn't do it.
[00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:19.460]  Nobody's going to deny that he's smart and capable.
[00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:24.100]  But he's been darling around with Joe Biden.
[00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:27.060]  So he promises he's not going to seek re-election.
[00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:29.780]  I think Steve Scalise would be great.
[00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:31.500]  That's who Matt Gaetz and others are pushing.
[00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:37.040]  Very honorable man, almost killed by a leftist lunatic, shot him trying to kill all those
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:39.620]  House members in the Freedom Caucus.
[00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:40.620]  So I would say Steve Scalise.
[00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:43.860]  I think I was the first to say it, but others have been saying it before.
[00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:44.860]  Now it's everywhere.
[00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:48.380]  MTG supports it, many others.
[00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:52.300]  Trump could probably get elected, and under the Constitution, you don't need to have a
[00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:56.140]  speaker that is even in Congress.
[00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:58.060]  So that's the wild card.
[00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:03.460]  Wouldn't it be great while he's being falsely charged and 91 in felony charges and four
[00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:07.600]  indictments and the rest of it, more coming, all these fake civil cases where judges are
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:09.580]  already finding him guilty.
[00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:15.140]  Wouldn't it be amazing to put Trump in, in the interim, as a Speaker of the House?
[00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:19.020]  There's some question on whether you can run for the presidency while you're the acting
[00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:20.020]  Speaker, but it looks like you can.
[00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:21.940]  It's not a long shot.
[00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:25.740]  We should just push that, draft Trump in, and the image of him as the Speaker with the
[00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:29.340]  gavel is just priceless bully pulpit.
[00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:30.340]  Let's do it.
[00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:31.340]  Let's make that happen.
[00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:33.220]  Let's call the Republican members of Congress.
[00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:35.980]  That guys, get me the number to Congress, please.
[00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:36.980]  They change it from time to time.
[00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:38.260]  I'm not sure what the current number is.
[00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:42.300]  And let's put the current number to Congress, make sure it's the right one.
[00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:50.460]  Hell, I'll call Congress live on air today, and I'm going to ask to talk to my closest
[00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:55.140]  Republican rep, Austin has a Democrat rep, but I'll pick one in a, in a jurisdiction
[00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:56.140]  nearby.
[00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:57.860]  We'll, we'll call them live on air.
[00:23:57.860 --> 00:23:58.860]  Let's do that.
[00:23:58.860 --> 00:23:59.860]  Let's get Trump in there.
[00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:05.660]  This is the type of imaginative ace in the hole thing that we need to play right now.
[00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:13.380]  You got to have an ace in the hole, little secret that nobody knows life is a gamble
[00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:17.380]  game we all play.
[00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:20.700]  So let's save those aces for a rainy day.
[00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:23.580]  You've got to have an ace in the hole.
[00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:28.260]  We got a lot of aces in the hole, but globalists are steamrolling towards absolute tyranny.
[00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:32.140]  We've got more top central bank globalists saying they're going to bring in central bank
[00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:35.740]  digital currency and track everything you buy, sell, and do to control you.
[00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:40.340]  I mean, it is just an incredible transmission lined up today.
[00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:48.660]  We also have a huge stack of news articles and video clips where from Texas to Pennsylvania,
[00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:54.860]  from California to Michigan, Illinois, to you name it, they're mass mandates in the
[00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:55.860]  public schools.
[00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:57.900]  So let's get that clip ready coming up.
[00:24:57.900 --> 00:24:59.460]  There's a bunch of clips, little kids.
[00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:01.500]  Hey, we're taking your mask off tomorrow.
[00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:02.500]  Yay!
[00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:03.500]  Yay!
[00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:04.500]  Oh!
[00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:11.460]  The brain damage, the bacterial pneumonia, the destruction of language, the depression
[00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:14.180]  of our children, and the monsters are right back doing it.
[00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:15.180]  We're totally vindicated.
[00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:17.620]  They're rolling it all out right now by piecemeal.
[00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:21.980]  But here's a clip of Matt Gaetz, one of the clips we'll be playing today.
[00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:25.620]  If you were to move forward, if there were to be any kind of agreement, what would that
[00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:29.180]  look like and what would you need to see from the speaker at this point?
[00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:32.380]  I think the die is cast based on the motion I just filed.
[00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:35.820]  I think the time for that discussion would have been over the last several weeks.
[00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:41.380]  But instead, we saw the speaker continuing, I mean, the speaker did not just fail to remediate
[00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:44.540]  the breach of the agreement he made with us in January.
[00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:46.620]  He accelerated the instances of breach.
[00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:50.540]  Like after I laid out the breach, he went and violated the 72 hour rule.
[00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:55.160]  After I laid out the breach, he violated the 100 million no amendment suspension rule.
[00:25:55.160 --> 00:26:02.040]  So he seems to be reverting to the very unfortunate muscle memory of Washington, D.C. that has
[00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:07.520]  put our nation atop a $33 trillion debt that has led to $2 trillion annual deficits in
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:11.680]  our near future and the rapid global de-dollarization of the economy.
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:16.080]  You look at the BRICS system, you know, Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, they're
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:17.880]  moving away from the dollar.
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:23.880]  And just in August, they added six new countries, including G20 countries, economies in the
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:26.280]  Western Hemisphere and Gulf monarchies.
[00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:33.480]  Moreover, you saw U.S. news say that the number one economic trend of 2023 is de-dollarization
[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:34.960]  globally.
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:35.960]  This worries me.
[00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:39.960]  You all get all worked up that there's going to be some uncomfortable, chaotic moment
[00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:44.040]  that I'll feel pressure from conservatives or Democrats or whomever.
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.880]  I feel the judgment of history.
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:47.440]  I feel the weight of that.
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:51.680]  I worry that when the history books are written about this country going down, that my name
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:53.680]  is going to be on the board of directors here.
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:58.000]  And if this country's going down and if we're losing the dollar, I am going down fighting.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.800]  And I don't care if that means fighting Republicans, Democrats, the Uniparty, the leadership,
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:04.400]  the PACs, the lobbyists.
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:05.400]  I've had it.
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:06.560]  I've been here seven years.
[00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:08.640]  We don't have a budget.
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:10.720]  We haven't had one since the mid-90s.
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:11.880]  I am through with it.
[00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:17.560]  I apologize for using that word, but the only path forward here is to have single subject
[00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:22.400]  spending bills that can be reviewed, amended, considered.
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:27.840]  I think that is the responsible way that our legislatures all over this country operate
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:28.840]  for good reason.
[00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:29.840]  How many Republicans do you have with you in the House?
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:35.360]  How do you respond to Kevin McCarthy's claim that this is payback for an ethics investigation?
[00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:38.360]  I am the most investigated man in the United States Congress.
[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:43.800]  I have been cleared by the FBI, the DOJ, the Federal Elections Commission by a 5-0 vote.
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:48.880]  It seems that the Ethics Committee's interest in me waxes and wanes based on my relationship
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:49.880]  with the Speaker.
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:54.760]  I believe that Speaker McCarthy is trying to signal to the Ethics Committee to pursue
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:55.760]  me.
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:28:00.520]  When I gave my Sunday interviews yesterday indicating that I intended to file this motion
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:05.960]  to vacate Speaker McCarthy, hours did not pass before Republicans and members of the
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:11.280]  Ethics Committee were backgrounding reporters that they wanted to expel me from the United
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:16.400]  States Congress for bringing a motion to vacate under the rules that we negotiated in January
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:18.880]  after Kevin McCarthy broke his word.
[00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:21.000]  They want to expel me from Congress from that.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.000]  So you know what?
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.000]  I'm built for the battle.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.320]  I face down tougher than these folks and I'll do it again.
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:33.120]  On March 6th, 2001, Alex Jones first predicted the September 11th attack on the World Trade
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:34.120]  Center.
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:39.440]  You've got an element of the FBI and these war game scenarios where they can remote
[00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:44.160]  control a 747 and they're going to crash it into the World Trade Center.
[00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:49.600]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:51.440]  about what's happening next.
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:56.080]  Visit InfoWars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
[00:28:56.140 --> 00:29:03.820]  Why do you think the globalists are desperately trying to censor everybody?
[00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:07.500]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk, everybody else?
[00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:11.740]  Because they can't get through this giant megalomaniacal power grab if we're here exposing
[00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:12.740]  them.
[00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:14.900]  But we're not just exposing their operation.
[00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:20.540]  In my new book, we give you the solutions to build a new, better world, an alternative
[00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:23.620]  to Klaus Schwab's, you will eat the bugs.
[00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:25.340]  This is the great awakening.
[00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:29.740]  The plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:33.540]  It's a companion to my last book that was a number one worldwide bestseller.
[00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:36.460]  And this book is even thicker and even more powerful.

[00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:07.380]  Omega-3 fatty acids are needed for optimal strength, and they can only be obtained through
[00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:08.380]  diet.
[00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:13.540]  They can be found in grass-fed beef, which is why the ruling class is trying to ban
[00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:14.540]  it.
[00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:20.900]  They can be found in fish, which are arguably the best source of omega-3s, but the problem
[00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:25.220]  today is finding fish without a high mercury content.
[00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:32.980]  Your best option is our Ultimate Fish Oil and Ultimate Krill Oil at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:39.420]  Omega-3 fatty acids are essential for both our neurological and cardiovascular systems,
[00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:41.580]  our brain and our heart.
[00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:46.440]  They improve mood, mental clarity, and immune function.

[00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:38.430]  Anthrax.
[00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:40.030]  Anthrax.
[00:33:40.030 --> 00:33:41.290]  And Radio.
[00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:42.970]  And Radio.
[00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:44.470]  And the cut.
[00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:46.970]  What have I told you?
[00:33:48.450 --> 00:33:53.250]  Anthrax and Radio.
[00:33:53.250 --> 00:33:54.250]  Hey, look up!
[00:33:58.250 --> 00:34:01.250]  What if I told you they've been lying
[00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:04.250]  About that double-wide with water rights?
[00:34:06.250 --> 00:34:08.250]  And now the tow cars are back again
[00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:11.250]  They sold you some old land
[00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:14.250]  About the greater good in sacrifice
[00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:18.250]  Your friends from Langley are back again
[00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:24.250]  It's a reliable source of information
[00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:29.250]  50,000 unstoppable watts
[00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:34.250]  Androx and Radial
[00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:38.250]  Like gravity, it is you, the listeners and viewers, that hold me in position
[00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:42.250]  Only you can keep us in attack formation
[00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:46.250]  Only you can defeat the new world order
[00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:47.250]  Hey, look up!
[00:34:47.250 --> 00:34:50.250]  You are the resistance
[00:34:54.250 --> 00:34:56.250]  Coming at you live
[00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:01.250]  Coming at you live
[00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:10.250]  Live, alive, I'm alive, you're alive
[00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:12.250]  Coming at you live
[00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:19.250]  Breaking!
[00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:22.250]  Jim Jordan now running for speaker as Trump considers roll
[00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:24.250]  It's just a people
[00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:32.250]  I've been waiting for this a long time
[00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:35.250]  My little green friend
[00:35:36.250 --> 00:35:38.250]  50,000
[00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:42.250]  Unstoppable
[00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:45.250]  Androx
[00:35:45.250 --> 00:35:47.250]  And Radial
[00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:50.250]  Hey, look up!
[00:35:54.250 --> 00:35:55.250]  Androx
[00:35:56.250 --> 00:35:58.250]  And Radial
[00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:00.250]  Hey, look up!
[00:36:15.250 --> 00:36:22.250]  When he sees the MSNBC camera, he literally mugs for it like he is
[00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:28.250]  In a Miss America pageant
[00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:33.250]  Or he just scored the winning touchdown at the Super Bowl in sudden death overtime
[00:36:33.250 --> 00:36:36.250]  He looks like he's having 15 orgasms
[00:36:36.250 --> 00:36:40.250]  Just like when Bill Gates talks about people dying, he just starts getting real excited
[00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:45.910]  By the way, there's that famous national baseball player, I meant to send the clip to the crew,
[00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:46.910]  I don't think I did.
[00:36:46.910 --> 00:36:50.830]  There's an article on Infowars about it, we'll get to it next hour.
[00:36:50.830 --> 00:36:56.870]  And the woman said he raped her, attacked her, and then she bragged to all her friends,
[00:36:56.870 --> 00:37:00.790]  hey, he's going to date me, I'm going to set him up and get all his money, and then she
[00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:08.589]  shot video of him in bed, laughing and giggling, and now that's got 80 million views today.
[00:37:08.589 --> 00:37:15.629]  So all the chickens are coming home to roost, ex-MLB star Trevor Bauer exposes damning
[00:37:15.629 --> 00:37:21.629]  messages from the insta-ho who accused him of violent rape.
[00:37:21.629 --> 00:37:29.229]  Yep, it's all coming out because he didn't back down, he didn't roll over, he'll probably
[00:37:29.229 --> 00:37:30.870]  go to jail now.
[00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:36.310]  He got the text messages in the lawsuit where she said, I'm going to set his ass up, then
[00:37:36.310 --> 00:37:39.069]  she shot video in bed with him while he was asleep, bragging about it.
[00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:50.140]  And the reason I'm going to play this clip is it shows the sociopathic, psychotic thing that's happened.
[00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:59.140]  And more, there used to be like maybe 1% of people was a psychotic, maybe 3% sociopath, but they're artificially creating them out.
[00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:07.140]  They think it's cute, they think it's funny to have no morals at all, but they always love to brag.
[00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:16.140]  You know, growing up, I'd see like cartoons and movies like Dr. No or Goldfinger where they got James Bond chained up, they're about to kill him.
[00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:20.140]  And then the villain brags and tells them the master plan.
[00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:23.140]  I'm like, that's not how things would really work.
[00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:25.140]  I guess I'm not a villain because I was going to do something to somebody.
[00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:27.140]  I'm not going to tell them I'm coming.
[00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:29.140]  You never know what hit you.
[00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:31.140]  But see, I'm not a villain.
[00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:38.140]  Villains love to monologue and tell you how smart they are and how criminal they are.
[00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:40.140]  And that's what they do.
[00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:51.140]  That's why we've got the globalists by the short hairs is because they bragged about every damn bit of their operation.
[00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:53.140]  Like we're animals that don't know.
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:57.760]  No, we've just been distracted and diverted in a trance.
[00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:03.080]  Once the trance is gone, once the spell is gone, once we're out of the deep sleep, now
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:10.640]  you're not facing a sleeping giant that you globalist Lilliputians, you Keeblers can defeat.
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:14.120]  Now you're dealing with Godzilla going nuclear.
[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:16.560]  In fact, cue that up.
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:22.440]  I'm not into cheesy movies and stuff, but I mean, it is a good metaphor for Godzilla
[00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:24.240]  gets hit with this weapon.
[00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:25.640]  He's about to die.
[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:30.680]  He goes down into his inner chamber in Atlantis to bathe in nuclear radiation, but it's not
[00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:31.680]  enough.
[00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:35.020]  So this Japanese hero detonates a hydrogen bomb to re-energize him.
[00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:41.920]  And then Godzilla goes to battle Gamora in Tokyo and detonates.
[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:44.480]  And that's exactly what I'm like and what you're like.
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:47.920]  All the stuff we've been through, if we don't give up, we don't realize that that which
[00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:52.640]  doesn't kill us only makes us stronger and that all these attacks, we can suck the energy
[00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:57.200]  in and then use it against the enemy because we're not engaged in black magic.
[00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:01.840]  But when they hit us with the energy, we can simply reflect it back at them.
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:03.040]  And that's what they can't deal with.
[00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:08.150]  And then we detonate, and nothing can stop us.
[00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:12.150]  Boom. Bye-bye.
[00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:19.150]  But we've got to understand that process sees that first we have to go through the fire.
[00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:24.150]  And at a certain point, their attacks literally get turned against them.
[00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:28.150]  The pit they prepare for us is the pit that will destroy them.
[00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:31.150]  Great job, crew, pulling that up in two seconds.
[00:40:31.150 --> 00:40:33.150]  This crew is unbelievable.
[00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:34.150]  I did not tell them I was going to say that.
[00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:36.150]  Okay, I'm impressed.
[00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:38.150]  Who's running the computer there?
[00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:40.150]  Who pulled that up in 1.5 seconds?
[00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:45.150]  Because if you were a gunslinger, you'd be the greatest gunslinger in history.
[00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:48.150]  I mean, I'm impressed, okay?
[00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:52.150]  So let's go to an incredibly powerful few minutes of it.
[00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:53.150]  We're going to skip this break.
[00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:58.150]  The full thing is up on InfoWars.com in the live show feed, or it's going to be.
[00:40:58.150 --> 00:40:59.150]  We're posting it there right now.
[00:40:59.150 --> 00:41:04.150]  Tucker Carlson interviews top historian Victor Davis Hanson about the current situation.
[00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:07.150]  Let's play a few minutes of this and then come back and get into all the other news.
[00:41:07.150 --> 00:41:14.150]  If you've ever wondered why it took you so long to figure out what's happening now in American politics,
[00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:15.150]  don't blame yourself.
[00:41:15.150 --> 00:41:16.150]  It's not your fault.
[00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:22.150]  It's hard for most Americans to comprehend the total dishonesty of American liberalism.
[00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:25.150]  Virtually nothing the liberal says is true.
[00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:27.150]  And the lies are not ordinary lies.
[00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:31.150]  The lies are so brazen, so aggressive and unending,
[00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:34.150]  that it's difficult for a normal person to understand what's happening.
[00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:39.150]  30 years ago, for example, liberals began to lecture us, softly at first,
[00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:43.150]  and then at an increasingly high volume, about tolerance.
[00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:46.150]  How could you have known then that they planned, in fact,
[00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:50.150]  to usher in the most intolerant age in American history?
[00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:51.150]  They've done that now.
[00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:53.150]  But few people saw it coming.
[00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:56.150]  We shouldn't make the same mistake again.
[00:41:56.150 --> 00:42:00.150]  Liberals are now telling us they plan to protect American democracy.
[00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:04.150]  And that's the clearest possible sign that they intend to end it.
[00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:08.150]  Thirteen months from this week, the United States will hold a national election.
[00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:13.150]  In a democracy, citizens can vote for the candidate of their choice.
[00:42:13.150 --> 00:42:15.150]  That's not just a feature.
[00:42:15.150 --> 00:42:18.150]  It's the defining fact of the electoral system.
[00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:19.150]  The people rule.
[00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:23.150]  They can send anyone they want to Washington because they're in charge.
[00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:28.150]  But this year, in the name of protecting democracy,
[00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:33.150]  liberals have decided to strip Donald Trump's name from the ballot in states across the country.
[00:42:33.150 --> 00:42:36.150]  Trump is the frontrunner in the presidential race.
[00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:39.150]  He's currently beating Joe Biden in the polls.
[00:42:39.150 --> 00:42:44.150]  Yet liberals have decided that you should not be allowed to elect him president.
[00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:46.150]  That's not democracy.
[00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:47.150]  It's the opposite.
[00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:49.150]  It's totalitarianism.
[00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:52.150]  Just this morning, Donald Trump appeared in court in New York
[00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:55.150]  in a civil case brought by the state's attorney general
[00:42:55.150 --> 00:42:59.150]  that was designed explicitly to keep him out of the White House.
[00:42:59.150 --> 00:43:02.150]  That case is part of a larger legal barrage against Trump
[00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:06.150]  that so far includes a total of 91 felony counts,
[00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:09.150]  every one of them politically motivated.
[00:43:09.150 --> 00:43:11.150]  But today's civil case is especially absurd.
[00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:14.150]  In fact, it's hard to overstate its ridiculousness.
[00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:20.150]  In sum, Trump stands accused of inflating the value of collateral used to secure loans,
[00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:24.150]  loans that he has already paid back with interest.
[00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:28.150]  In other words, there is no injured party in this case.
[00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:31.150]  The biggest banks in the world assessed the risk,
[00:43:31.150 --> 00:43:34.150]  and they made a profit, as they almost always do.
[00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:36.150]  Not a single person was defrauded.
[00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:40.150]  For this non-crime, Trump and his children
[00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:43.150]  are in the process of losing their homes and their businesses.
[00:43:43.150 --> 00:43:46.150]  Here's MSNBC's live coverage of the hearing today.
[00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:51.150]  And as you watch, pay special attention to the judge in the case, Arthur Ngoron.
[00:43:51.150 --> 00:43:55.150]  And there you see President Trump, the former president, I should say,
[00:43:55.150 --> 00:43:58.150]  next to his attorney, and that's Chris Kyes,
[00:43:58.150 --> 00:44:01.150]  who we expect to make the opening statements here.
[00:44:01.150 --> 00:44:06.150]  And then this, I guess, is Judge Ngoron.
[00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:08.150]  There he is, the judge,
[00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:11.150]  mugging like he's on stage at a middle school play,
[00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:13.150]  grinning, preening for the camera.
[00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:17.150]  Arthur Ngoron is thrilled to be on MSNBC.
[00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:19.150]  It's nauseating.
[00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:21.150]  This is not a legal proceeding.
[00:44:21.150 --> 00:44:25.150]  This is a grotesque parody of the system that our forefathers created,
[00:44:25.150 --> 00:44:27.150]  the fairest in the world,
[00:44:27.150 --> 00:44:32.150]  that in the years since has been seized by power worshipers like Arthur Ngoron.
[00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:35.150]  This is a dangerous moment.
[00:44:35.150 --> 00:44:37.150]  Without a legitimate legal system,
[00:44:37.150 --> 00:44:39.150]  people will no longer follow the law,
[00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:41.150]  and the country will collapse.
[00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:43.150]  This is not about Trump.
[00:44:43.150 --> 00:44:47.150]  This is about preserving the United States of America.
[00:44:47.150 --> 00:44:49.150]  But Trump is at the center of the story.
[00:44:49.150 --> 00:44:53.150]  And so today, for an overview of what exactly the strategy
[00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:56.150]  to prevent Trump from running for president
[00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:58.150]  and to end our current system,
[00:44:58.150 --> 00:45:02.150]  we turn to Victor Davis Hanson, who joins us now.
[00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:05.150]  Professor, thank you very much for joining us.
[00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:07.150]  Thank you for having me, Tucker.
[00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:12.150]  Before we get into the details of the legal assault on Trump,
[00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:14.150]  which in my view isn't really about Trump,
[00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:16.150]  tell us what you think is at stake here.
[00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:18.150]  What's the overview?
[00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:22.150]  Well, I think they've come to the conclusion
[00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:26.150]  that Trump represented an existential threat,
[00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:29.150]  and by association, half the country did
[00:45:29.150 --> 00:45:33.150]  to their vision of what they want to transform us into.
[00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:36.150]  And so they feel that any means necessary
[00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:40.150]  are justified by their noble spiritual ends,
[00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:43.150]  and therefore they call it critical legal theory,
[00:45:43.150 --> 00:45:45.150]  just essentially, Tucker says,
[00:45:45.150 --> 00:45:47.150]  there's rules against stealing
[00:45:47.150 --> 00:45:50.150]  only because rich people don't steal,
[00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:52.150]  and therefore it's okay to steal.
[00:45:52.150 --> 00:45:55.150]  And modern monetary theory says print as much money,
[00:45:55.150 --> 00:45:59.150]  and eventually rich people will have to pay higher taxes
[00:45:59.150 --> 00:46:02.150]  or have their 401ks appropriated.
[00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:04.150]  Same thing with the border.
[00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:06.150]  Short term, everybody's mad at the border,
[00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:08.150]  but in dark rooms, they're saying to each other,
[00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:11.150]  in 10 years, everybody's going to appreciate what we did.
[00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:14.150]  We brought in 10 to 15 million new constituents.
[00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:16.150]  So I guess to put it all together,
[00:46:16.150 --> 00:46:19.150]  they feel that they're at a stage now
[00:46:19.150 --> 00:46:23.150]  where their agenda does not appeal to 51% of the people,
[00:46:23.150 --> 00:46:26.150]  and they either have to bring in new constituencies
[00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:28.150]  or change the system,
[00:46:28.150 --> 00:46:31.150]  the entire system of which we are acculturated to,
[00:46:31.150 --> 00:46:34.150]  to retain power, and that's what they're willing to do.
[00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:40.150]  And there's no such thing anymore as theft or lies
[00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:42.150]  or any of these things,
[00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:44.150]  because they're just constructs,
[00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:48.150]  and they're just anything that's useful to gain power
[00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:50.150]  is considered legitimate,
[00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:54.150]  and anything that's not useful is illegitimate,
[00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:56.150]  and that's how they define morality.
[00:46:56.150 --> 00:46:59.150]  And I think we're very naive, Tucker.
[00:46:59.150 --> 00:47:01.150]  We realize that we're in the middle of a revolution.
[00:47:01.150 --> 00:47:05.150]  We think that we're still playing within the same sidelines or parameters,
[00:47:05.150 --> 00:47:06.150]  and it's not.
[00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:08.150]  Everything's under negotiation,
[00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:11.150]  whether it's the Senate filibuster, the Electoral College,
[00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:14.150]  new states coming in, the size of the Supreme Court,
[00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:17.150]  voting IDs, the genders,
[00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:19.150]  the foundational data of the United States,
[00:47:19.150 --> 00:47:23.150]  pronoun usage from the trivial to the existential.
[00:47:23.150 --> 00:47:27.150]  We're in the middle of a cultural, economic, political revolution,
[00:47:27.150 --> 00:47:29.150]  and I think we've got to wake up.
[00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:35.150]  I suppose the danger is that if the average person decides
[00:47:35.150 --> 00:47:38.150]  that the system is illegitimate, it's not fair,
[00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:45.150]  it doesn't have any meaning beyond the political desires of the people administering it,
[00:47:45.150 --> 00:47:50.150]  then what prevents the average person from resorting to violence?
[00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:53.150]  In other words, if you have no power, if your vote means nothing,
[00:47:53.150 --> 00:48:00.150]  if the system is BS, then why don't you take up arms?
[00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:01.150]  Seriously.
[00:48:03.150 --> 00:48:06.150]  Well, two things I think have precluded that so far.
[00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:08.150]  One is I call it the monastery of the mind.
[00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:10.150]  A lot of people just say, you know what?
[00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:12.150]  I'm checking out.
[00:48:12.150 --> 00:48:14.150]  I don't want to watch the Oscars.
[00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:16.150]  I don't even know what the Tonys or Emmys are.
[00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:19.150]  I don't watch the NBA.
[00:48:19.150 --> 00:48:22.150]  I have nothing to do with Hollywood movies.
[00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:24.150]  I've just created my own reality.
[00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:29.150]  And the other is under our federalist system, we're having millions of people.
[00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:32.150]  This is the greatest exodus diaspora we've ever seen in our history
[00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:37.150]  where people are fleeing these blue states and blue cities to red states,
[00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:41.150]  and they feel that I'm going to recreate America as I once understood it
[00:48:41.150 --> 00:48:43.150]  without having anything to do.
[00:48:43.150 --> 00:48:50.150]  And so far that's kept us sort of viable, but for them that's not enough.
[00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:54.150]  It's never enough to have 2 million illegal entrants or 3 million.
[00:48:54.150 --> 00:48:57.150]  They've got to have 8 or 9 or 10.
[00:48:57.150 --> 00:49:00.150]  It's not enough that Joe Biden is corrupt.
[00:49:00.150 --> 00:49:04.150]  It's not enough that he's non-compos mentis.
[00:49:04.150 --> 00:49:07.150]  It's not enough that his agenda doesn't make sense.
[00:49:07.150 --> 00:49:10.150]  You've got to accept more and more of him.
[00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:12.150]  And I think they keep pushing the envelope,
[00:49:12.150 --> 00:49:15.150]  and these safety valves that I just mentioned,
[00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:17.150]  I don't know if they're going to be enough already.
[00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:21.150]  But right now I think there's one last effort on the part of conservatives.
[00:49:21.150 --> 00:49:26.150]  They're going to say, you know what, we're going to speak up as we've never spoken up before.
[00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:28.150]  We're going to go after Target.
[00:49:28.150 --> 00:49:30.150]  We're going to go after Disney.
[00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:34.150]  We're going to say that we're going to go after the three-gender movement,
[00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:36.150]  and we're going to try to win this election.
[00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:37.150]  We're going to try to win the House.
[00:49:37.150 --> 00:49:39.150]  We're going to try to win the representative.
[00:49:39.150 --> 00:49:41.150]  We just have to unite behind.
[00:49:41.150 --> 00:49:42.150]  And we'll see if that works.
[00:49:42.150 --> 00:49:43.150]  I'm really afraid.
[00:49:43.150 --> 00:49:45.150]  Everybody says democracy is in danger,
[00:49:45.150 --> 00:49:50.150]  but I think if they feel that they have the majority of the people,
[00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:56.150]  and I think the majority of the people are against this progressive Jacobin agenda,
[00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:59.150]  and they still can't find power, then we're going to be in new territory.
[00:49:59.150 --> 00:50:00.150]  We're in new territory now.
[00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:01.150]  Stop it right there.
[00:50:01.150 --> 00:50:02.150]  And so there are legit—
[00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:04.150]  Back it up 10 seconds.
[00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:11.150]  This Jacobin revolution now, he's one of the top recognized historians worldwide.
[00:50:11.150 --> 00:50:14.150]  And what have I been telling you for 20 years we're up against?
[00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:16.150]  We're up against Jacobins.
[00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:17.150]  People say, what's a Jacobin?
[00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:20.150]  Well, you should look it up.
[00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:24.150]  Adam Weishaupt, the founder of the Illuminati in Bavaria,
[00:50:24.150 --> 00:50:27.150]  in 1776 to counter George Washington,
[00:50:27.150 --> 00:50:29.150]  George Washington wrote letters about this.
[00:50:29.150 --> 00:50:33.150]  He was a top mason, and he said there's a satanic group taking over the masons.
[00:50:33.150 --> 00:50:34.150]  This is in his national letters.
[00:50:34.150 --> 00:50:38.150]  Just type in George Washington letters on the Illuminati into search engine.
[00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:39.150]  You'll get the National Archives.
[00:50:39.150 --> 00:50:40.150]  There's dozens of them.
[00:50:40.150 --> 00:50:41.150]  It's incredible.
[00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:49.150]  His photo scans of his handwritten letters, even got like moth holes eaten in it.
[00:50:49.150 --> 00:50:53.150]  He's 200-plus years old, 240 years old.
[00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:57.150]  And masons aren't bad.
[00:50:57.150 --> 00:50:59.150]  It's that they've been used to take over.
[00:50:59.150 --> 00:51:01.150]  I'm not going to get into the defense of the masons.
[00:51:01.150 --> 00:51:02.150]  I'm not a mason.
[00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:03.150]  I just studied history.
[00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:15.150]  You didn't get in college in Greece or Babylon or Egypt 3,000, 4,000 years ago
[00:51:15.150 --> 00:51:17.150]  if you were just a common person.
[00:51:17.150 --> 00:51:21.150]  You had to go to a mystery school where they taught alchemy,
[00:51:21.150 --> 00:51:25.150]  the beginnings of science, but also a lot of ancient religions and ideas.
[00:51:25.150 --> 00:51:27.150]  They taught you all of them.
[00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:29.150]  And then Solomon was trained by that.
[00:51:29.150 --> 00:51:32.150]  He's the wisest man that ever lived, the Bible says, King David's son.
[00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:36.150]  And that's what the Jewish mysticism comes out of, European mysticism,
[00:51:36.150 --> 00:51:41.150]  all the studies of magic, the occult, which just means hidden.
[00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:43.150]  And Adam Weisshaupt, the founder of the Illuminati,
[00:51:43.150 --> 00:51:46.150]  this is mainline history books, he founded the group that created
[00:51:46.150 --> 00:51:48.150]  the French Revolution and the Jacobins.
[00:51:48.150 --> 00:51:53.150]  They wanted a nine-day work week, no families, transgenderism.
[00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:55.150]  They wanted to cut children's penises off.
[00:51:55.150 --> 00:51:56.150]  You might have heard of all this.
[00:51:56.150 --> 00:52:01.150]  You might have seen this a little bit before because you're up against Jacobins.
[00:52:01.150 --> 00:52:02.150]  And that's what they are.
[00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:04.150]  You heard of the Red Terror in Lenin.
[00:52:04.150 --> 00:52:06.150]  Karl Marx, you know, came 100 years later.
[00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:10.150]  It's all a copy of the French Revolution and the Illuminati,
[00:52:10.150 --> 00:52:11.150]  which do not illuminate.
[00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:13.150]  Christ illuminates.
[00:52:13.150 --> 00:52:15.150]  Open freedom illuminates.
[00:52:15.150 --> 00:52:20.150]  They call themselves the illuminated ones because Lucifer was the lightbearer
[00:52:20.150 --> 00:52:24.150]  that people couldn't look at God in heaven, so he would basically be a mirror
[00:52:25.150 --> 00:52:32.150]  that God shone on and you could see a mirror image that was lesser.
[00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:36.150]  So there's George Washington to William Russell, September 28, 1798,
[00:52:36.150 --> 00:52:39.150]  on the Illuminati.
[00:52:39.150 --> 00:52:43.150]  So we're up against the Illuminati, according to our founder,
[00:52:43.150 --> 00:52:53.150]  George Washington, according to Victor Davis Hanson.
[00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:54.150]  And that's what you're up against.
[00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:59.150]  They want total order destroyed to bring in an absolute dictatorship
[00:52:59.150 --> 00:53:00.150]  on the ashes.
[00:53:00.150 --> 00:53:05.150]  And Napoleon was brought in by them on the ashes of that.
[00:53:05.150 --> 00:53:10.150]  So out of their great reset that destroys the existing civilization,
[00:53:10.150 --> 00:53:14.150]  they bring in the ultimate tyrant that they control.
[00:53:14.150 --> 00:53:16.150]  They fear tyrants they don't control.
[00:53:16.150 --> 00:53:17.150]  I'm not lionizing tyrants.
[00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:20.150]  The tyrant definition, again, has multi meanings.
[00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:26.150]  In parlance, nomenclature, vernacular, it means a horrible oppressive system
[00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:27.150]  or horrible oppressive leader.
[00:53:27.150 --> 00:53:33.150]  Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Xi Jinping, Justin Trudeau.
[00:53:33.150 --> 00:53:37.150]  But in the Greek sense, it was a powerful leader that takes over
[00:53:37.150 --> 00:53:39.150]  with the support of the people.
[00:53:39.150 --> 00:53:41.150]  That's the ancient definition.
[00:53:41.150 --> 00:53:47.150]  The globalists fear a tyrannous or a terrible one who is of the people
[00:53:47.150 --> 00:53:49.150]  against the elite.
[00:53:49.150 --> 00:53:51.150]  So I'm not selling tyranny here.
[00:53:51.150 --> 00:53:55.150]  I'm simply getting into the actual definitions historically of what it means
[00:53:55.150 --> 00:53:56.150]  to the globalists.
[00:53:56.150 --> 00:54:00.150]  A tyrant is one thing versus what we see a tyrant as, different creatures.
[00:54:00.150 --> 00:54:09.150]  But a tyranny of a ruling aristocracy, an oligarchy, a Platoian model
[00:54:09.150 --> 00:54:11.150]  is what we're under today.
[00:54:11.150 --> 00:54:15.150]  And Plato was a eugenicist, the founder of eugenics.
[00:54:15.150 --> 00:54:18.150]  And the whole Malthusian system picked up thousands of years later
[00:54:18.150 --> 00:54:25.150]  by Sir Thomas Malthus, Galton, Wedgwood, Huxley, and others.
[00:54:28.150 --> 00:54:30.150]  So those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it,
[00:54:30.150 --> 00:54:36.150]  and we are here promoting a Americana Renaissance Christian revolution,
[00:54:36.150 --> 00:54:42.150]  not a forced conversion, but by example, to be Christlike.
[00:54:42.150 --> 00:54:46.150]  The most successful settlements in Africa are where blacks
[00:54:46.150 --> 00:54:48.150]  adopted Christianity.
[00:54:48.150 --> 00:54:49.150]  Incredibly so.
[00:54:49.150 --> 00:54:51.150]  You go to Africa, you get black people to become Christian,
[00:54:51.150 --> 00:54:54.150]  actually follow it, they're just as successful as Europeans.
[00:54:54.150 --> 00:54:57.150]  Europeans were living in caves and huts and killing each other
[00:54:57.150 --> 00:54:59.150]  until they got Christianity, just like Africans.
[00:54:59.150 --> 00:55:02.150]  We acted just like Africans today.
[00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:03.150]  You can go, look at those savages.
[00:55:03.150 --> 00:55:06.150]  Well, we were until we got Jesus.
[00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:11.150]  Yes, how does Jeffrey Dahmer do all these terrible things?
[00:55:11.150 --> 00:55:13.150]  He's got the devil in him.
[00:55:13.150 --> 00:55:15.150]  How do all these black people out attacking white people
[00:55:15.150 --> 00:55:16.150]  doing terrible things?
[00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:18.150]  They got the devil in them, folks.
[00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:22.150]  It's not the color of their skin, it's the spirit in their heart.
[00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:26.150]  And that's the reality of what we're facing.
[00:55:26.150 --> 00:55:29.150]  And that's what this book, now available at infowarshore.com,
[00:55:29.150 --> 00:55:31.150]  signed or unsigned, The Great Reset.
[00:55:31.150 --> 00:55:33.150]  The fundraiser's a signed copy.

[00:56:47.250 --> 00:56:49.250]  And that makes this dog hunt.
[00:56:49.250 --> 00:56:51.250]  Plus, they're really incredible products.
[00:56:51.250 --> 00:56:55.250]  I was sitting there because I went for like an 8-mile hike this weekend
[00:56:55.250 --> 00:56:58.250]  and had been in the gym a lot, so I lifted weights really hard.
[00:56:58.250 --> 00:57:00.250]  I'm strong and I should take more care.
[00:57:00.250 --> 00:57:09.250]  Like, I shouldn't do, you know, leg press at 500 pounds 8 times just because I can't.
[00:57:09.250 --> 00:57:11.250]  And I hurt my knee.
[00:57:11.250 --> 00:57:12.250]  And Sunday, my wife goes,
[00:57:12.250 --> 00:57:15.250]  why don't you take your turmeric formula?
[00:57:15.250 --> 00:57:16.250]  Because she's sold on it.
[00:57:16.250 --> 00:57:18.250]  It's better than the one she buys at the store.
[00:57:18.250 --> 00:57:19.250]  You're right.
[00:57:19.250 --> 00:57:20.250]  I took four of them.
[00:57:20.250 --> 00:57:23.250]  And the next day, my right knee doesn't hurt.
[00:57:24.250 --> 00:57:26.250]  Pretty simple.
[00:57:26.250 --> 00:57:29.250]  So, Bonnie's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:29.250 --> 00:57:30.250]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:57:30.250 --> 00:57:32.250]  4% off right now on the Tribeca sale.
[00:57:32.250 --> 00:57:33.250]  All right.
[00:57:33.250 --> 00:57:34.250]  We're going to start hour number two.
[00:57:34.250 --> 00:57:35.250]  We're going to get into everything.
[00:57:35.250 --> 00:57:37.250]  It's going to be an incredible transmission.
[00:57:37.250 --> 00:57:40.250]  The globalists hope you don't listen to, hope you don't watch,
[00:57:40.250 --> 00:57:42.250]  and they sure as hell hope you don't share it.
[00:57:42.250 --> 00:57:43.250]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:43.250 --> 00:57:44.250]  Hour number two.
[00:57:44.250 --> 00:57:46.250]  Straight ahead, my patriots.
[00:57:48.060 --> 00:57:53.060]  Where were you when humanity was fighting for its life?
[00:57:53.060 --> 00:57:58.060]  Where were you when the globalists were caught trafficking millions of children for sex slavery worldwide?
[00:57:58.060 --> 00:58:02.060]  Where were you when the New World Order was starting World War III with Russia?
[00:58:02.060 --> 00:58:06.060]  Well, I know where you are. You're watching and listening to Infowars.com right now.
[00:58:06.060 --> 00:58:08.060]  And I salute you and thank you.
[00:58:08.060 --> 00:58:14.060]  And I want to encourage all of you who've been in this fight so long to realize we've reached the critical juncture in the battle now.
[00:58:14.060 --> 00:58:21.060]  And a key tool in that fight is the Great Awakening, defeating the globalists, and launching the next great renaissance.
[00:58:21.060 --> 00:58:25.060]  This is my second book, part two of The Great Recent and War for the World.
[00:58:25.060 --> 00:58:28.060]  It's a longer book, quite frankly, a more powerful book.
[00:58:28.060 --> 00:58:33.060]  And just like the last book went to number one, it is up to you to send us a number one right now.
[00:58:33.060 --> 00:58:37.060]  This is a cultural fight against the globalists, and it funds the Infowar.

[00:59:52.060 --> 00:59:57.060]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:59:57.060 --> 01:00:09.060]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:15.060]  We just have to unite behind, and we'll see if that works.
[01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:23.060]  I'm really afraid, everybody says democracy's in danger, but I think if they feel that they have the majority of the people,
[01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:30.060]  and I think the majority of the people are against this progressive Jacobin agenda and they still can't find power,
[01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:32.060]  then we're going to be in new territory.
[01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:39.060]  We're in new territory now, and so there are legitimate efforts to rectify and stop this madness,
[01:00:39.060 --> 01:00:45.060]  and let's see what happens in 2024, but I don't think it works anymore just to migrate to a red state
[01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:47.060]  or to drop out of the popular culture.
[01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:52.060]  You've got to get control of the political apparatus of the country through elections,
[01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:55.060]  and your worry is legitimate.
[01:00:55.060 --> 01:00:58.060]  If you can't do it through fair elections, then what do you do?
[01:00:58.060 --> 01:01:03.060]  So I think this election, I know everybody says that, that each election is paramount,
[01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:07.060]  but this one is very important because we're in the middle of a revolution,
[01:01:07.060 --> 01:01:11.060]  and it's our only avenue to a counter-revolution to return to normality.
[01:01:11.060 --> 01:01:17.060]  What would you say to the people who've stopped paying their cable bill and moved to Florida
[01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:20.060]  and feel like everything's fine because their neighborhood is fine?
[01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:24.060]  Why is that a bad strategy, dropping out and moving?
[01:01:26.060 --> 01:01:34.060]  Because they can find you, and by that I mean Florida or Tennessee or living in Texas
[01:01:34.060 --> 01:01:41.060]  is a great advantage than living in California or Michigan or Oregon or Washington or Maryland,
[01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:46.060]  but eventually the federal government is not satisfied to leave you alone,
[01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:52.060]  and so when you go on your Google search, it will be calibrated by an algorithm
[01:01:52.060 --> 01:01:56.060]  to make sure that you have results that don't represent reality,
[01:01:56.060 --> 01:02:02.060]  and we're in a federal system where we have $33 trillion in debt,
[01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:04.060]  and there's only three ways to get out of it.
[01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:09.060]  You either have to inflate all of our currency, which we're trying to do, I suppose,
[01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:13.060]  or we're going to have to appropriate capital, which they've talked about,
[01:02:13.060 --> 01:02:18.060]  giving credit to Social Security years by taking 401k money,
[01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:22.060]  or you're going to have to renounce the debt, and that's going to affect all of us,
[01:02:22.060 --> 01:02:27.060]  and I don't need to mention that a lot of this crime is going across state lines,
[01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:31.060]  and you can be in red state Texas, and the federal government can say,
[01:02:31.060 --> 01:02:36.060]  you can't protect the Texas border, or maybe it can redefine the American border
[01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:39.060]  as the border with Oklahoma instead of Texas.
[01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:41.060]  You're not sending your illegals northward,
[01:02:41.060 --> 01:02:44.060]  but you're not going to be able to stop them coming into your state
[01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:48.060]  because we've targeted you for radical demographic change.
[01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:57.060]  So it's a stopgap sanctuary, but it shouldn't lull us into the idea that it's a solution.
[01:02:57.060 --> 01:03:00.060]  The solution is to take back the Congress,
[01:03:00.060 --> 01:03:05.060]  to ensure the Supreme Court is a traditional Supreme Court, and to win the presidency.
[01:03:05.060 --> 01:03:09.060]  But unfortunately, the Republican Party, which we all look to,
[01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:14.060]  I don't look to it very much anymore, has lost seven out of the last eight popular votes,
[01:03:14.060 --> 01:03:22.060]  hasn't won 51% since George H.W. Bush did it by bringing in Lee Atwater in 1988,
[01:03:22.060 --> 01:03:25.060]  and we decided we don't want to ever win that way again.
[01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:27.060]  It was too ugly, they thought.
[01:03:27.060 --> 01:03:34.060]  So I guess the idea on the national level is to lose nobly and never to win ugly,
[01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:37.060]  but we've got to change that attitude because we're dealing with people
[01:03:37.060 --> 01:03:41.060]  that are not Democratic liberals in the way that we used to define them
[01:03:41.060 --> 01:03:44.060]  as Bill Clinton or Harry Truman or JFK.
[01:03:44.060 --> 01:03:47.060]  This is a new generation of, as I said, Jacobins,
[01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:55.060]  and they believe that any means necessary are justified morally to achieve their morally superior aims.
[01:03:55.060 --> 01:04:03.060]  What happens if Democrats win the presidency in 2024?
[01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:06.060]  If they win the presidency, that means they'll keep the Senate
[01:04:06.060 --> 01:04:08.060]  and they'll probably take back the House.
[01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:18.060]  And then I would expect that we would see another 10 or 15 million illegal immigrants come across the border
[01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:24.060]  and there would be efforts to confine those immigrants from going to northern cities.
[01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:27.060]  They would stop them somehow.
[01:04:27.060 --> 01:04:33.060]  I would assume that we would probably have advisers in Ukraine
[01:04:33.060 --> 01:04:36.060]  and that would be charitable.
[01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:41.060]  I think people really do want to intervene in Ukraine with U.S. manpower.
[01:04:41.060 --> 01:04:46.060]  I would assume that what we see in the big cities crime-wise would extend,
[01:04:46.060 --> 01:04:52.060]  but it would also extend in the civil sphere as we see with Donald Trump.
[01:04:52.060 --> 01:04:54.060]  By the way, Biden's announced he's going to keep the illegals in Texas.
[01:04:54.060 --> 01:04:57.060]  This is already happening. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[01:04:59.290 --> 01:05:04.290]  Why do you think the globalists are desperately trying to censor everybody?
[01:05:04.290 --> 01:05:07.290]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk and everybody else?
[01:05:07.290 --> 01:05:12.290]  Because they can't get through this giant megalomaniacal power grab if we're here exposing them.
[01:05:12.290 --> 01:05:15.290]  But we're not just exposing their operation.
[01:05:15.290 --> 01:05:19.290]  In my new book, we give you the solutions to build a new, better world.
[01:05:19.290 --> 01:05:23.290]  An alternative to Klaus Schwab's, you will eat the bugs.
[01:05:23.290 --> 01:05:29.290]  This is The Great Awakening, the plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[01:05:29.290 --> 01:05:33.290]  It's a companion to my last book. It was a number one worldwide bestseller.
[01:05:33.290 --> 01:05:36.290]  And this book is even thicker and even more powerful.
[01:05:36.290 --> 01:05:41.290]  Get your copy of The Great Awakening today at infowarstore.com.

[01:06:21.290 --> 01:06:27.290]  Alright, we're now into hour number two of this live Wednesday, October 4th, 2023 transmission.
[01:06:27.290 --> 01:06:29.290]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[01:06:29.290 --> 01:06:34.290]  Mark Moreno, former top Republican advisor to the Senate on the whole globalist takeover plan.
[01:06:34.290 --> 01:06:37.290]  One of the top visionaries out there, laying this out decades ago.
[01:06:37.290 --> 01:06:41.290]  He'll be joining us coming up in about 25 minutes from now.
[01:06:41.290 --> 01:06:45.290]  And then Marjorie Taylor Greene, supporting Trump to be Speaker of the House.
[01:06:45.290 --> 01:06:47.290]  We'll explain constitutionally how that can happen.
[01:06:47.290 --> 01:06:52.290]  She'll be joining us coming up in about an hour and 25 minutes from now.
[01:06:52.290 --> 01:06:54.290]  Kate Daly, host the fourth hour.
[01:06:54.290 --> 01:06:56.290]  Again, I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:06:57.290 --> 01:07:00.290]  We've got confirmed rollout of the new COVID protocols.
[01:07:00.290 --> 01:07:05.290]  They now admit, I have the newscast, the clips, the articles, that yeah, we're bringing COVID back.
[01:07:06.290 --> 01:07:11.290]  Bloomberg, AP, Reuters, local TV stations, it's here.
[01:07:12.290 --> 01:07:16.290]  So without having a debate about it, we're like, oh no, we're not bringing it back.
[01:07:16.290 --> 01:07:22.290]  We're just bringing back the vaccine mandates, the contact tracing, the mask for the kids in the schools, all of it.
[01:07:22.290 --> 01:07:24.290]  I'm going to hit that coming up next segment.
[01:07:25.290 --> 01:07:30.290]  But I got to tell you, I really admire Matt Gaetz and his courage because that's the type of person they'll kill.
[01:07:30.290 --> 01:07:31.290]  They've already tried to put him in prison.
[01:07:31.290 --> 01:07:34.290]  McCarthy lied about everything he said he'd do.
[01:07:34.290 --> 01:07:39.290]  And as I said months ago, and as you said, it's been a popular thing, but I was the first yesterday to say it.
[01:07:39.290 --> 01:07:44.290]  Right as McCarthy was voted out of the speakership, I went on Owen's show at 3 p.m. Central.
[01:07:45.290 --> 01:07:48.290]  Owen Troyer, soon to be political prisoner in our wonderful free country for free speech.
[01:07:49.290 --> 01:07:53.290]  Just looked no further than right in my own office how bad it is, how bad these people are.
[01:07:54.290 --> 01:07:56.290]  And I said, we should nominate Trump for the speakership.
[01:07:56.290 --> 01:07:59.290]  Boom, everybody else was already about to say it as well.
[01:08:00.290 --> 01:08:01.290]  So great minds think alike.
[01:08:02.290 --> 01:08:03.290]  We've got all of that going on.
[01:08:03.290 --> 01:08:08.290]  But Matt Gaetz is sitting there being questioned by a gaggle of hundreds of reporters.
[01:08:09.290 --> 01:08:11.290]  Or I guess a swarm of gaggles, less than 100.
[01:08:12.290 --> 01:08:14.290]  And they're like, oh, you're a narcissist.
[01:08:14.290 --> 01:08:15.290]  This is all about you.
[01:08:15.290 --> 01:08:16.290]  No, it's all about the truth.
[01:08:19.290 --> 01:08:21.290]  And I said yesterday, he will be nominated.
[01:08:21.290 --> 01:08:24.290]  And he has now been nominated by a bunch of members of Congress.
[01:08:24.290 --> 01:08:27.290]  That is a very, very exciting story.
[01:08:27.290 --> 01:08:30.290]  And the video's up on Band.Video and InfoWars.com.
[01:08:31.290 --> 01:08:36.290]  But MTG, Marjorie Taylor Greene will be joining us coming up at 1.30 Central.
[01:08:36.290 --> 01:08:41.290]  So I guess that's technically about an hour and 40-something minutes from now.
[01:08:41.290 --> 01:08:45.290]  So be sure and watch for that and share that because that's how we reach new people.
[01:08:45.290 --> 01:08:46.290]  You're informed.
[01:08:46.290 --> 01:08:47.290]  You're awake.
[01:08:47.290 --> 01:08:48.290]  Let's awake.
[01:08:48.290 --> 01:08:53.290]  Let's awaken other people or fully awaken other people that are really primed and ready right now.
[01:08:53.290 --> 01:08:56.290]  The harvest of minds is here to empower them and unlock them.
[01:08:57.290 --> 01:09:00.290]  But only you can carry the ball down the field.
[01:09:00.290 --> 01:09:04.290]  So here's Matt Gaetz with more on why he did what he did.
[01:09:05.290 --> 01:09:07.290]  He's talking to reporters outside the Capitol right now.
[01:09:07.290 --> 01:09:09.290]  Congressman Gaetz, if not McCarthy, then who?
[01:09:09.290 --> 01:09:12.290]  You catalyzed the House of Representatives today.
[01:09:12.290 --> 01:09:13.290]  To whose benefit?
[01:09:13.290 --> 01:09:15.290]  People have called you a narcissist.
[01:09:15.290 --> 01:09:17.290]  People say that it's to your benefit alone.
[01:09:17.290 --> 01:09:20.290]  Is it to the benefit of you and to Donald Trump?
[01:09:20.290 --> 01:09:24.290]  It's to the benefit of this country that we have a better Speaker of the House than Kevin McCarthy.
[01:09:24.290 --> 01:09:26.290]  Kevin McCarthy couldn't keep his word.
[01:09:26.290 --> 01:09:31.290]  He made an agreement in January regarding the way Washington would work and he violated that agreement.
[01:09:31.290 --> 01:09:33.290]  We are $33 trillion in debt.
[01:09:33.290 --> 01:09:36.290]  We are facing $2.2 trillion annual deficits.
[01:09:36.290 --> 01:09:42.290]  We face a de-dollarization globally that will crush Americans, working class Americans.
[01:09:42.290 --> 01:09:45.290]  Kevin McCarthy is a feature of the swamp.
[01:09:45.290 --> 01:09:51.290]  He has risen to power by collecting special interest money and redistributing that money in exchange for favors.
[01:09:52.290 --> 01:09:54.290]  We are breaking the fever now.
[01:09:54.290 --> 01:09:56.290]  And we should elect a Speaker who's better.
[01:09:56.290 --> 01:09:58.290]  So if not Kevin McCarthy, then who?
[01:09:58.290 --> 01:10:02.290]  You said last night that Steve Scalise was a name that you floated to potentially be Speaker.
[01:10:02.290 --> 01:10:04.290]  Where do things stand right now?
[01:10:04.290 --> 01:10:05.290]  If not McCarthy, then who?
[01:10:05.290 --> 01:10:10.290]  Well, you know, the stages of grief I think are in progress right now with some of my colleagues.
[01:10:10.290 --> 01:10:15.290]  I think there was a stage of denial and I've certainly experienced a good amount of their anger.
[01:10:15.290 --> 01:10:17.290]  And now we appear to be headed toward bargaining.
[01:10:17.290 --> 01:10:20.290]  I think the world of Steve Scalise, I think he'd make a phenomenal Speaker.
[01:10:20.290 --> 01:10:23.290]  We've got less than 45.
[01:10:23.290 --> 01:10:29.290]  I'm afraid of $33 trillion in debt crushing the working people in my district.
[01:10:29.290 --> 01:10:32.290]  I'm afraid of the dollar losing its status as the global reserve currency.
[01:10:32.290 --> 01:10:35.290]  If they want to expel me, let me know when they have the vote.
[01:10:35.290 --> 01:10:43.290]  We've got less than 45 days left before you have to pass a budget, which is something that you've been wanting to do.
[01:10:43.290 --> 01:10:46.290]  Doesn't this just completely paralyze the House?
[01:10:46.290 --> 01:10:48.290]  I mean, we could see 15 more rounds.
[01:10:48.290 --> 01:10:49.290]  I don't think we will.
[01:10:49.290 --> 01:10:51.290]  I think Kevin McCarthy should take a hint.
[01:10:51.290 --> 01:10:57.290]  After 15 ballots to become Speaker, after eight months of a failed Speakership,
[01:10:57.290 --> 01:11:03.290]  and after removal in this historic manner, I think we should move on and find somebody else.
[01:11:03.290 --> 01:11:07.290]  What's paralyzed the House of Representatives has been the failure of Speaker McCarthy.
[01:11:07.290 --> 01:11:10.290]  What paralyzed the House of Representatives was not taking up appropriations bills.
[01:11:10.290 --> 01:11:16.290]  We left for a six-week vacation while the appropriations process hung in the balance.
[01:11:16.290 --> 01:11:21.290]  And because I forced these people to take a few votes, you think I'm paralyzing the House of Representatives?
[01:11:21.290 --> 01:11:25.290]  I think the House of Representatives has been paralyzed for the last several decades
[01:11:25.290 --> 01:11:30.290]  as we've refused to pass a budget and as we've governed by continuing resolution and omnibus bill.
[01:11:30.290 --> 01:11:36.290]  So I think that this represents the ripping off of the Band-Aid, and that's what we need to do to get back on track.
[01:11:36.290 --> 01:11:38.290]  How do you pass anything if 200 Republicans?
[01:11:38.290 --> 01:11:40.290]  How do you pass anything?
[01:11:40.290 --> 01:11:44.290]  What do you say to your colleagues who argue you don't have another name right now?
[01:11:44.290 --> 01:11:47.290]  You don't have someone else who could get 218 votes.
[01:11:47.290 --> 01:11:48.290]  What do you tell those folks?
[01:11:48.290 --> 01:11:53.290]  Well, I would tell them that for certain, Kevin McCarthy can't get 218 votes, so let's try the next person.
[01:11:53.290 --> 01:11:55.290]  How do you pass something?
[01:11:55.290 --> 01:12:00.290]  There would have to be a real meeting of the minds there.
[01:12:00.290 --> 01:12:05.290]  How do you pass something if there's 200 Republicans?
[01:12:05.290 --> 01:12:11.290]  Are you going to ask for a guarantee from whoever is floated as a candidate for the next Speaker
[01:12:11.290 --> 01:12:16.290]  for them to actually move the appropriations process along in a speed that satisfies you?
[01:12:16.290 --> 01:12:17.290]  Yes.
[01:12:17.290 --> 01:12:20.290]  Congressman, at this point, would you be putting yourself forward for the Speakship?
[01:12:20.290 --> 01:12:23.290]  Absolutely not. I have no desire to be Speaker of the House.
[01:12:23.290 --> 01:12:28.290]  Congressman, with all due respect, how do you pass something if you don't have 200 Republicans behind you?
[01:12:28.290 --> 01:12:31.290]  I know we've already asked about names, but what about Emmer and others?
[01:12:31.290 --> 01:12:33.290]  I think the world to Tom Emmer. He'd make a great Speaker.
[01:12:33.290 --> 01:12:36.290]  Congressman, have you spoken with any of these?
[01:12:36.290 --> 01:12:37.290]  Have you spoken with Emmer?
[01:12:37.290 --> 01:12:40.290]  I've spoken with him, but I'll probably keep our conversations between us.
[01:12:40.290 --> 01:12:47.290]  Congressman, what was going through your head when the vote dabbled down and it was official McCarthy wasn't Speaker?
[01:12:47.290 --> 01:12:51.290]  We've got to move to the next step. We are not at the end of this process.
[01:12:51.290 --> 01:12:57.290]  At most, we're approaching halftime. We've got to be able to assemble a governing coalition.
[01:12:57.290 --> 01:13:00.290]  We have to build from a place of trust.
[01:13:00.290 --> 01:13:04.290]  The reason Kevin McCarthy went down today is because nobody trusts Kevin McCarthy.
[01:13:04.290 --> 01:13:09.290]  Kevin McCarthy has made multiple contradictory promises, and when they all came due,
[01:13:09.290 --> 01:13:13.290]  he lost votes of people who maybe don't even ideologically agree with me on everything.
[01:13:13.290 --> 01:13:16.290]  Take, for example, my colleague from South Carolina, Ms. Mace.
[01:13:16.290 --> 01:13:23.290]  She has different views than I do on a variety of subjects, but what we had in common, Kevin McCarthy lied to all of us.
[01:13:23.290 --> 01:13:26.290]  Congressman, hold on a second. You're saying that nobody trusts Kevin McCarthy,
[01:13:26.290 --> 01:13:36.290]  but you're talking about, including yourself, about seven Republicans compared to about 200 Republicans who actually do trust him.
[01:13:36.290 --> 01:13:39.290]  Can you explain that here?
[01:13:39.290 --> 01:13:44.290]  As it turns out, getting 200 Republicans to trust you isn't enough to stay Speaker.
[01:13:44.290 --> 01:13:52.290]  Have you spoken to former President Trump about this since the ousting? Was he supportive of what you were doing?
[01:13:52.290 --> 01:13:55.290]  I have spoken to President Trump over the last several days.
[01:13:55.290 --> 01:13:58.290]  The ousting only occurred several minutes ago, so we haven't spoken during that time.
[01:13:58.290 --> 01:14:02.290]  Former President Trump, though, he put on truth social that he didn't think this was a good idea.
[01:14:02.290 --> 01:14:05.290]  He didn't want to see Republicans fighting with other Republicans.
[01:14:05.290 --> 01:14:06.290]  How do you respond to that?
[01:14:06.290 --> 01:14:08.290]  All right, let's stop right there, go to break, come back with more of this.
[01:14:08.290 --> 01:14:10.290]  Look, here's the deal.
[01:14:10.290 --> 01:14:13.290]  Things are broken. Things are out of control. McCarthy's a liar.
[01:14:13.290 --> 01:14:17.290]  Is there a perfect path forward? No, but we can't sit here always doing the same thing.
[01:14:17.290 --> 01:14:21.290]  And we've just demonstrated the power of the people.
[01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:28.290]  And whoever the next speaker is will know that and will remove he or she if they don't do the right thing.
[01:14:28.290 --> 01:14:33.290]  They don't even read the bills since the mid 1990s.
[01:14:33.290 --> 01:14:36.290]  It's a joke. We're 33 trillion in debt.
[01:14:36.290 --> 01:14:42.290]  The globalist banks that run the country right now are positioning us to be Zimbabwe or Venezuela.
[01:14:42.290 --> 01:14:44.290]  This is their plan.
[01:14:44.290 --> 01:14:48.290]  What did Klaus Schwab say? What did Maury Strong say?
[01:14:48.290 --> 01:14:53.290]  They said to bring in the world government, America has to be brought down to a lower status
[01:14:53.290 --> 01:14:56.290]  because they don't want people aspiring to be a first world country.
[01:14:56.290 --> 01:14:59.290]  They want to make us a third world country.
[01:14:59.290 --> 01:15:01.290]  And that's what they're doing.
[01:15:01.290 --> 01:15:03.290]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[01:15:03.290 --> 01:15:06.290]  So let's stop being naive. This is bold.
[01:15:06.290 --> 01:15:08.290]  This is the right thing to do.
[01:15:08.290 --> 01:15:14.290]  Let's get on the offense and let's start bringing votes up to defund the Justice Department and the FBI
[01:15:14.290 --> 01:15:17.290]  and Jack Smith and the rest of the U.N. prosecutors.
[01:15:17.290 --> 01:15:19.290]  That's the power of the purse and a check and balance.
[01:15:19.290 --> 01:15:22.290]  Where is the Supreme Court?
[01:15:22.290 --> 01:15:26.290]  Trump paid his loans on time or before.
[01:15:26.290 --> 01:15:34.290]  And they say Mar-a-Lago is worth $18 million when a vacant lot of two acres just sold for $50 million two weeks ago.
[01:15:34.290 --> 01:15:38.290]  I mean, it's crap, folks. It's all lies. It's all BS.
[01:15:38.290 --> 01:15:43.290]  And let's call it for what it is and just stop rolling over because we're scared of the corporate media
[01:15:43.290 --> 01:15:45.290]  the Democratic Party controls.
[01:15:45.290 --> 01:15:46.290]  The corporate media is a joke.
[01:15:46.290 --> 01:15:50.290]  To be attacked by the corporate media is to be endorsed by the people.
[01:15:50.290 --> 01:15:52.290]  They're done. They're over.
[01:15:52.290 --> 01:15:54.290]  They're a house of cards. They're a paper tiger.
[01:15:54.290 --> 01:15:55.290]  They're a facade.
[01:15:55.290 --> 01:15:56.290]  We'll be right back.
[01:15:59.290 --> 01:16:03.290]  Why do you think the globalists are desperately trying to censor everybody?
[01:16:03.290 --> 01:16:06.290]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk and everybody else?
[01:16:06.290 --> 01:16:11.290]  Because they can't get through this giant megalomaniacal power grab if we're here exposing them.
[01:16:11.290 --> 01:16:14.290]  But we're not just exposing their operation.
[01:16:14.290 --> 01:16:22.290]  In my new book, we give you the solutions to build a new, better world, an alternative to Klaus Schwab's you will eat the bugs.
[01:16:22.290 --> 01:16:28.290]  This is The Great Awakening, the plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[01:16:28.290 --> 01:16:30.290]  It's a companion to my last book.
[01:16:30.290 --> 01:16:32.290]  It was a number one worldwide bestseller.
[01:16:32.290 --> 01:16:35.290]  And this book is even thicker and even more powerful.

[01:20:51.810 --> 01:20:55.810]  Well, last night, Matt Gaetz tweeted back at him, I just brought it.
[01:20:55.810 --> 01:21:00.810]  Jim Jordan to run for House Speaker. That's good news.
[01:21:00.810 --> 01:21:05.810]  So many big articles up on Infowars.com.
[01:21:05.810 --> 01:21:12.810]  But right now, ladies and gentlemen, let's get into the poison shots.
[01:21:12.810 --> 01:21:16.810]  Look at these headlines. ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN.
[01:21:16.810 --> 01:21:22.810]  Philly public schools revive mask mandate for students after winter break.
[01:21:22.810 --> 01:21:23.810]  Oh.
[01:21:23.810 --> 01:21:28.890]  It's all being pushed.
[01:21:28.890 --> 01:21:34.530]  Horizon brings back mask rules for hospitals ahead of expected COVID increase.
[01:21:34.530 --> 01:21:35.530]  Companies are doing it.
[01:21:35.530 --> 01:21:39.930]  Health order requires SLO county health workers to be vaccinated or mask.
[01:21:39.930 --> 01:21:40.930]  October 4, 2023.
[01:21:40.930 --> 01:21:41.930]  That's today.
[01:21:41.930 --> 01:21:46.770]  Uptick in New York's COVID deaths last month, COVID mask mandates.
[01:21:46.770 --> 01:21:47.770]  Restrictions return.

[01:22:03.530 --> 01:22:05.890]  Yeah, right.
[01:22:05.890 --> 01:22:11.570]  And it goes on hospitals across the country, colleges across the country, businesses across
[01:22:11.570 --> 01:22:12.570]  the country.
[01:22:12.570 --> 01:22:16.690]  The FDA reinstates universal masking.
[01:22:16.690 --> 01:22:20.330]  Told you starting in September, going into October.
[01:22:20.330 --> 01:22:21.690]  Our face mask coming back.
[01:22:21.690 --> 01:22:23.290]  The experts want you to know.
[01:22:23.290 --> 01:22:29.090]  Guys, you have that clip of the little kids cheering just a year and a half ago.
[01:22:29.090 --> 01:22:32.650]  They were going to take the mask off and here they are doing it again with all the
[01:22:32.650 --> 01:22:36.490]  neurological problems, all the development problems, all the depression that crank up
[01:22:36.490 --> 01:22:37.490]  the audio.
[01:22:37.490 --> 01:22:38.490]  Start it over.
[01:22:39.490 --> 01:22:44.490]  Starting tomorrow, we don't have to wear masks anymore.
[01:22:49.490 --> 01:22:56.290]  A giant exercise in abusive mind control, they admit, caused massive suicide, huge cases
[01:22:56.290 --> 01:23:01.970]  all over the Western world of bacterial pneumonia, developmental issues.
[01:23:01.970 --> 01:23:06.090]  And starting now, the masks go back on.
[01:23:06.090 --> 01:23:07.090]  No.
[01:23:07.690 --> 01:23:09.650]  That's not true.
[01:23:09.650 --> 01:23:10.650]  That's impossible.
[01:23:10.650 --> 01:23:13.850]  Can we queue up Luke Skywalker to Darth Vader?
[01:23:13.850 --> 01:23:15.690]  Search your feelings.
[01:23:15.690 --> 01:23:18.210]  You know it to be true.
[01:23:18.210 --> 01:23:19.210]  That's not true.
[01:23:19.210 --> 01:23:20.210]  That's impossible.
[01:23:20.210 --> 01:23:25.610]  No, Luke, you will wear the mask.
[01:23:25.610 --> 01:23:27.730]  You will take the shot.
[01:23:27.730 --> 01:23:28.970]  But it doesn't protect me.
[01:23:28.970 --> 01:23:30.650]  It makes me sick.
[01:23:30.650 --> 01:23:33.290]  You will take the shots.
[01:23:33.490 --> 01:23:37.210]  Luke, Bill Gates needs to kill you.
[01:23:37.210 --> 01:23:44.370]  You've not yet begun to discover how important depopulating you is.
[01:23:44.370 --> 01:23:50.650]  All over the country, Baylor, college, got to wear a mask, got to have the shot.
[01:23:50.650 --> 01:23:51.650]  It's here.
[01:23:51.650 --> 01:23:52.650]  Do you think I made that up?
[01:23:52.650 --> 01:23:58.170]  But I talked to my TSA whistleblower two weeks ago and they said, yeah, they told us it was
[01:23:58.170 --> 01:24:01.850]  coming down in a month.
[01:24:01.850 --> 01:24:07.810]  But it didn't because they don't want to give the world that, oh, Alex Jones was right
[01:24:07.810 --> 01:24:08.810]  about the TSA.
[01:24:08.810 --> 01:24:14.330]  They literally held back on that but rolled everything else out.
[01:24:14.330 --> 01:24:20.530]  Imagine how powerful, with you the listeners and our guests, this whole operation is that
[01:24:20.530 --> 01:24:22.050]  they told the memo was coming down.
[01:24:22.050 --> 01:24:31.450]  You saw out of British Columbia and other states, other provinces of Canada, Europe's doing it.
[01:24:32.050 --> 01:24:34.970]  They're bringing back the mask mandates, the vaccine mandates.
[01:24:34.970 --> 01:24:36.730]  They're trying it here.
[01:24:36.730 --> 01:24:41.090]  They're now announcing health care workers across Canada.
[01:24:41.090 --> 01:24:43.130]  But same thing in Australia.
[01:24:43.130 --> 01:24:44.130]  They're trying it again.
[01:24:44.130 --> 01:24:45.130]  But the public's bucking it.
[01:24:45.130 --> 01:24:51.810]  You're saying, no, we didn't just sit here and take the rollout of this thing.
[01:24:51.810 --> 01:24:57.290]  We said no, no, no, no, no.
[01:24:57.290 --> 01:24:58.290]  And I get it.
[01:24:58.650 --> 01:25:02.690]  I'm like, they're planning on rolling it all back out incrementally, accelerating in
[01:25:02.690 --> 01:25:04.650]  the next year to try to mail in ballots again.
[01:25:04.650 --> 01:25:10.410]  And people were literally like Luke Skywalker saying, that's not true.
[01:25:10.410 --> 01:25:11.410]  That's impossible.
[01:25:11.410 --> 01:25:12.410]  Come on.
[01:25:12.410 --> 01:25:18.450]  Famous Empire Strikes Back, Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker singing in Cloud City.
[01:25:18.450 --> 01:25:23.570]  The guys found the Godzilla clip in like a second and a half, but now they can't find
[01:25:23.570 --> 01:25:24.570]  that clip.
[01:25:25.570 --> 01:25:29.410]  But that's what this is like, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:25:29.410 --> 01:25:34.010]  People cannot believe after the scam you've been through together that they're doing it
[01:25:34.010 --> 01:25:35.010]  again.
[01:25:35.010 --> 01:25:36.010]  Well, you're awake.
[01:25:36.010 --> 01:25:37.010]  A lot of people aren't.
[01:25:37.010 --> 01:25:39.970]  And so they're not going to get all of us, but there are a lot of people will go take
[01:25:39.970 --> 01:25:44.810]  the quote booster, the fifth, sixth booster, the fifth, the sixth, the sixth.
[01:25:44.810 --> 01:25:46.810]  Now go ahead and crank the audio up.
[01:25:46.810 --> 01:25:47.810]  Here it is.
[01:25:48.810 --> 01:25:50.810]  No.
[01:26:01.810 --> 01:26:03.810]  It's not true.
[01:26:04.810 --> 01:26:06.810]  That's impossible.
[01:26:06.810 --> 01:26:07.810]  Search your feelings.
[01:26:07.810 --> 01:26:09.810]  You know it to be true.
[01:26:10.810 --> 01:26:12.810]  No.
[01:26:13.810 --> 01:26:15.810]  No.
[01:26:18.810 --> 01:26:22.810]  Let's come back next time with like a three minute clip of that for Mark Moreno or get
[01:26:22.810 --> 01:26:23.810]  it ready now.
[01:26:23.810 --> 01:26:26.810]  But I mean, look, you think I'm going to get up here and say they're about to roll it all
[01:26:26.810 --> 01:26:31.810]  out like pulling out of my ass, even though I know this TSA source for 20 something years
[01:26:31.810 --> 01:26:33.810]  and they're high level.
[01:26:33.810 --> 01:26:37.810]  Personally, you know, I'm just from separate stuff in life and they called me about this
[01:26:37.810 --> 01:26:41.810]  and I met with them and I made other phone calls and then they started rolling it out.
[01:26:41.810 --> 01:26:46.810]  I mean, I don't make stuff up, so don't let them gaslight you and say there's no new
[01:26:46.810 --> 01:26:47.810]  covid restrictions.
[01:26:47.810 --> 01:26:50.810]  You see what the White House has said.
[01:26:50.810 --> 01:26:54.810]  The press secretary, she's like, well, it never went away.
[01:26:54.810 --> 01:26:55.810]  It's always been like this.
[01:26:55.810 --> 01:26:58.810]  This is just the way it is.
[01:26:58.810 --> 01:26:59.810]  Really, is it the way it always was?
[01:26:59.810 --> 01:27:01.810]  So why do the children play that clip again?
[01:27:01.810 --> 01:27:07.810]  It's so happy when they heard the abuse of mass that the evil left this cult in between
[01:27:07.810 --> 01:27:10.810]  trying to cut their genitals off wants to make them do.
[01:27:10.810 --> 01:27:13.810]  Here it is.
[01:27:13.810 --> 01:27:14.810]  Start from the start.
[01:27:14.810 --> 01:27:16.810]  Hear the teacher.
[01:27:16.810 --> 01:27:20.810]  Starting tomorrow, we don't have to wear masks anymore.
[01:27:20.810 --> 01:27:24.810]  Starting tomorrow, the mask go back on and more poison shots.
[01:27:24.810 --> 01:27:27.810]  Get ready for heart attacks, my little sweeties.
[01:27:27.810 --> 01:27:30.810]  We can't cut your genitals off or rape you.
[01:27:30.810 --> 01:27:34.810]  We're going to give you a poison shot.
[01:27:38.810 --> 01:27:42.810]  Is everybody excited?
[01:27:42.810 --> 01:27:44.810]  Meanwhile, illegal aliens don't have to take the shots.
[01:27:44.810 --> 01:27:45.810]  The border is wide open.
[01:27:45.810 --> 01:27:48.810]  They're mass smuggling children drugged on fentanyl.
[01:27:48.810 --> 01:27:49.810]  Many of them are dying.
[01:27:49.810 --> 01:27:51.810]  But it's OK because it's liberal.
[01:27:51.810 --> 01:27:54.810]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[01:27:54.810 --> 01:27:55.810]  Mark Moreno is coming up.
[01:27:55.810 --> 01:27:56.810]  We're going to break.

[01:27:57.810 --> 01:27:58.810]  Plus, it's an amazing book.
[01:27:58.810 --> 01:28:02.810]  Why would you want to have the rebel book, the book written by the guy, the globalist
[01:28:02.810 --> 01:28:03.810]  fear?
[01:28:03.810 --> 01:28:05.810]  Number two, I'm El Segundo after Trump.

[01:28:13.810 --> 01:28:14.810]  It is jam packed.
[01:28:14.810 --> 01:28:16.810]  It is a must read.
[01:28:16.810 --> 01:28:20.810]  Adrenochrome, Satanism, the New World Order, their mindset, how to counter them, how to
[01:28:20.810 --> 01:28:21.810]  defeat them.

[01:29:06.810 --> 01:29:10.810]  Now we've put part two out and it's even thicker and more powerful.
[01:29:10.810 --> 01:29:11.810]  The Great Awakening.
[01:29:11.810 --> 01:29:15.810]  The plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[01:29:15.810 --> 01:29:17.810]  This is such a powerful book.
[01:29:17.810 --> 01:29:22.810]  It covers all the globalist plans, the latest developments, how to stop them, and then gives
[01:29:22.810 --> 01:29:26.810]  an alternate plan of a society we could build together.
[01:29:26.810 --> 01:29:28.810]  That's why it's The Great Awakening.
[01:29:28.810 --> 01:29:30.810]  The Great Awakening is happening right now.
[01:29:30.810 --> 01:29:35.810]  You can get signed or unsigned copies of the book at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:29:35.810 --> 01:29:36.810]  This is a historic book.

[01:29:52.810 --> 01:29:53.810]  Awakening.

[01:29:54.810 --> 01:29:56.810]  I want to thank you for your support.
[01:29:56.810 --> 01:29:57.810]  It's a powerful book.
[01:29:57.810 --> 01:29:58.810]  Get yours now.
[01:29:58.810 --> 01:30:02.810]  Where were you when humanity was fighting for its life?
[01:30:03.810 --> 01:30:07.810]  Where were you when the globalists were caught trafficking millions of children for sex slavery
[01:30:07.810 --> 01:30:08.810]  worldwide?
[01:30:08.810 --> 01:30:11.810]  Where were you when the New World Order was starting World War III with Russia?
[01:30:11.810 --> 01:30:12.810]  Well, I know where you are.
[01:30:12.810 --> 01:30:15.810]  You're watching and listening to Infowars.com right now.
[01:30:15.810 --> 01:30:17.810]  I salute you and thank you.
[01:30:17.810 --> 01:30:21.810]  I want to encourage all of you who've been in this fight so long to realize we've reached
[01:30:21.810 --> 01:30:23.810]  the critical juncture in the battle now.
[01:30:23.810 --> 01:30:29.810]  A key tool in that fight is The Great Awakening, defeating the globalists, and launching the
[01:30:29.810 --> 01:30:30.810]  next great renaissance.
[01:30:30.810 --> 01:30:34.810]  This is my second book, part two of The Great Renaissance and War for the World.
[01:30:34.810 --> 01:30:37.810]  It's a longer book, quite frankly, a more powerful book.
[01:30:37.810 --> 01:30:41.810]  And just like the last book went to number one, it is up to you to send it to number
[01:30:41.810 --> 01:30:42.810]  one right now.
[01:30:42.810 --> 01:30:46.810]  This is a cultural fight against the globalists, and it funds the Infowar.

[01:30:58.810 --> 01:31:02.810]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years that our amazing, high-quality
[01:31:02.810 --> 01:31:03.810]  coffee has not been available.
[01:31:03.810 --> 01:31:07.810]  And that's because the prices went up too high for the raw beans and the quality had
[01:31:07.810 --> 01:31:08.810]  gone down some.
[01:31:08.810 --> 01:31:11.810]  I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us.
[01:31:11.810 --> 01:31:18.810]  But now we have brought back the coffee, and it's even better from a national supplier
[01:31:18.810 --> 01:31:21.810]  that's veteran-owned and veteran-operated.
[01:31:21.810 --> 01:31:24.810]  It's powered by the company Minuteman Coffee.
[01:31:24.810 --> 01:31:31.810]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the best-tasting, best-smelling, strongest coffee that I have
[01:31:31.810 --> 01:31:32.810]  ever drank.
[01:31:32.810 --> 01:31:34.810]  It is game-changing.
[01:31:34.810 --> 01:31:37.810]  All you got to do is buy a bag of it and try it.
[01:31:37.810 --> 01:31:40.810]  I know you're going to be hooked, which will then fund your Operation A360 win.
[01:31:40.810 --> 01:31:44.810]  Go to Infowarstore.com right now for Escape the Prison Planet Light Roast.
[01:31:44.810 --> 01:31:45.810]  That's the strongest.
[01:31:45.810 --> 01:31:48.810]  The amazing Medium Roast Wig of America.
[01:31:48.810 --> 01:31:53.810]  And finally, the best-tasting Dark Roast Tip of the Spear, now exclusively available at
[01:31:53.810 --> 01:31:55.810]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:31:55.810 --> 01:31:57.810]  Get your coffee now.
[01:31:59.810 --> 01:32:02.810]  I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had.
[01:32:02.810 --> 01:32:04.810]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[01:32:04.810 --> 01:32:08.810]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[01:32:08.810 --> 01:32:13.810]  When we talk about the crew at Infowars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[01:32:13.810 --> 01:32:17.810]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[01:32:17.810 --> 01:32:21.810]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every
[01:32:21.810 --> 01:32:26.810]  day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[01:32:26.810 --> 01:32:29.810]  So for myself and the whole Infowars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[01:32:29.810 --> 01:32:34.810]  I want to encourage you now to realize that Infowars cannot stay on air if you do not
[01:32:34.810 --> 01:32:35.810]  support us.
[01:32:35.810 --> 01:32:36.810]  I know you spread the word.
[01:32:36.810 --> 01:32:37.810]  I know you pray for us.
[01:32:37.810 --> 01:32:38.810]  And that's wonderful.
[01:32:38.810 --> 01:32:39.810]  Keep doing it.
[01:32:39.810 --> 01:32:42.810]  But most viewers and listeners never go to Infowarsstore.com.
[01:32:42.810 --> 01:32:46.810]  And you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, all at the same time
[01:32:46.810 --> 01:32:47.810]  keep us on air.
[01:32:47.810 --> 01:32:51.810]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:32:51.810 --> 01:32:56.810]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to Infowarsstore.com, our funding problems
[01:32:56.810 --> 01:32:57.810]  will be over.
[01:32:57.810 --> 01:32:58.810]  Please take action now.
[01:32:59.810 --> 01:33:04.810]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:33:04.810 --> 01:33:06.810]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:09.010 --> 01:33:14.010]  Mark Moreno, the top expert of the New World Order, is about to join us live.
[01:33:17.010 --> 01:33:22.010]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:33:22.010 --> 01:33:25.010]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he.
[01:33:25.010 --> 01:33:31.010]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:32.010 --> 01:33:36.010]  You are beaten. It is useless to resist.
[01:33:36.010 --> 01:33:39.010]  Don't let yourself be destroyed as Obi-Wan did.
[01:33:54.010 --> 01:33:58.010]  There is no escape. Don't miss it.
[01:34:01.010 --> 01:34:03.010]  Don't make me destroy you.
[01:34:05.010 --> 01:34:09.010]  Luke, you do not yet realize your importance.
[01:34:09.010 --> 01:34:12.010]  You have only begun to discover your power.
[01:34:12.010 --> 01:34:17.010]  Join me, and I will complete your training.
[01:34:17.010 --> 01:34:25.010]  With our combined strength, we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy.
[01:34:25.010 --> 01:34:27.010]  I'll never join you!
[01:34:27.010 --> 01:34:31.010]  If you only knew the power of the dark side,
[01:34:31.010 --> 01:34:36.010]  Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father.
[01:34:36.010 --> 01:34:38.010]  He told me enough.
[01:34:40.010 --> 01:34:42.010]  He told me you killed him.
[01:34:42.010 --> 01:34:46.010]  No. I am your father.
[01:34:52.010 --> 01:34:56.010]  No. It's not true.
[01:34:57.010 --> 01:34:59.010]  That's impossible.
[01:34:59.010 --> 01:35:03.010]  Search your feelings. You know it to be true.
[01:35:03.010 --> 01:35:08.010]  No! No!
[01:35:14.010 --> 01:35:18.010]  No, you're not bringing back the attempts at lockdowns, but they are.
[01:35:18.010 --> 01:35:20.010]  We've been vindicated all over the place.
[01:35:20.010 --> 01:35:24.010]  Mass mandates, force injection mandates from Texas to New York.
[01:35:25.010 --> 01:35:28.010]  From Washington State to Illinois.
[01:35:28.010 --> 01:35:30.010]  The public has not been caught flat-footed.
[01:35:30.010 --> 01:35:32.010]  But we cannot have a better guest.
[01:35:32.010 --> 01:35:34.010]  Former Chief Advisor of the Republican Senate.
[01:35:34.010 --> 01:35:38.010]  Leading expert on the whole globalist great reset.
[01:35:38.010 --> 01:35:42.010]  Nobody's been out there more than Mark Moreno, myself, and Lord Christopher Monckton
[01:35:42.010 --> 01:35:44.010]  exposing that he's got his best-selling book,
[01:35:44.010 --> 01:35:49.010]  The Great Reset, Globalist Elites, and the Permanent Lockdown.
[01:35:49.010 --> 01:35:51.010]  And for the next 45 minutes, he joins us.
[01:35:51.010 --> 01:35:53.010]  We're very blessed he can come on.
[01:35:53.010 --> 01:35:58.010]  He's always knocking it out of the park, but he has been slaying it on Fox and everywhere else.
[01:35:58.010 --> 01:36:00.010]  So, Mark, I know you're a busy man.
[01:36:00.010 --> 01:36:01.010]  Great to have you here.
[01:36:01.010 --> 01:36:03.010]  Where do you want to start?
[01:36:03.010 --> 01:36:07.010]  I mean, wow, are we not vindicated with UN global treaties to take over our bodies,
[01:36:07.010 --> 01:36:12.010]  UN censorship treaties, banning beef, you will eat the bugs, synthetic meat,
[01:36:12.010 --> 01:36:17.010]  California trying to ban classic cars, trying to ban anything that uses natural gas,
[01:36:17.010 --> 01:36:20.010]  gas stoves, generators.
[01:36:20.010 --> 01:36:22.010]  It is just a full-on assault.
[01:36:22.010 --> 01:36:26.010]  All these third-world countries like China and Mexico make zero cuts.
[01:36:26.010 --> 01:36:30.010]  I mean, we are in the new world order now.
[01:36:30.010 --> 01:36:31.010]  We are.
[01:36:31.010 --> 01:36:34.010]  I mean, people say, oh, the Great Reset is a conspiracy theory.
[01:36:34.010 --> 01:36:39.010]  Well, one thing, and I know you know this, you don't even need anonymous sources,
[01:36:39.010 --> 01:36:40.010]  secret documents.
[01:36:40.010 --> 01:36:43.010]  Everything they're doing is out in the open.
[01:36:43.010 --> 01:36:46.010]  In my book, in my talks, in my presentations, reports,
[01:36:46.010 --> 01:36:51.010]  I use all open source, BBC, corporate media, the UN's own words,
[01:36:51.010 --> 01:36:55.010]  the World Economic Forum's own words, the World Health Organization's own words.
[01:36:55.010 --> 01:36:59.010]  Nothing they're doing is essentially hidden.
[01:36:59.010 --> 01:37:01.010]  This is all out in the open.
[01:37:01.010 --> 01:37:03.010]  In fact, I bet your only problem was you had too much to put in the book,
[01:37:03.010 --> 01:37:05.010]  because that's been my own problem.
[01:37:05.010 --> 01:37:06.010]  Yes, exactly.
[01:37:06.010 --> 01:37:09.010]  I mean, you end up with hundreds of footnotes and pages,
[01:37:09.010 --> 01:37:13.010]  I mean, I think 80 pages, 90 pages of just footnotes.
[01:37:13.010 --> 01:37:15.010]  And here's the thing.
[01:37:15.010 --> 01:37:17.010]  This is, in a very nutshell, what this is.
[01:37:17.010 --> 01:37:23.010]  And what's really happened since the COVID lockdowns in March of 2020,
[01:37:23.010 --> 01:37:28.010]  the entire ruling class elite, your Harvard, your Yale, your Oxford,
[01:37:28.010 --> 01:37:34.010]  your academia, your government elite bureaucrats, your senators,
[01:37:34.010 --> 01:37:37.010]  congressmen, the presidents and parliamentarians,
[01:37:37.010 --> 01:37:41.010]  all lusted after one-party Chinese rule.
[01:37:41.010 --> 01:37:46.010]  And in my book, I go back decades from Tom Friedman praising China's
[01:37:46.010 --> 01:37:49.010]  one-party rule as, quote, the enlightened dictatorship
[01:37:49.010 --> 01:37:51.010]  and how they can get things done on climate.
[01:37:51.010 --> 01:37:55.010]  David Rockefeller, Justin Trudeau, dictatorships are so good.
[01:37:55.010 --> 01:37:56.010]  Yes.
[01:37:56.010 --> 01:37:59.010]  Yeah, Justin Trudeau, basic admiration for China's dictatorship.
[01:37:59.010 --> 01:38:01.010]  Christina Figueres, the UN climate chief.
[01:38:01.010 --> 01:38:05.010]  So in a nutshell, you have Apple CEO, Tim Cook,
[01:38:05.010 --> 01:38:10.010]  saying that Apple and China's values are aligned beautifully on climate.
[01:38:10.010 --> 01:38:12.010]  You have Jennifer Granholm.
[01:38:12.010 --> 01:38:13.010]  You have Obama administration officials.
[01:38:13.010 --> 01:38:15.010]  You have Klaus Schwab.
[01:38:15.010 --> 01:38:17.010]  You have the UN secretary all praising China,
[01:38:17.010 --> 01:38:19.010]  specifically the one-party rule.
[01:38:19.010 --> 01:38:21.010]  You have the UN climate chief,
[01:38:21.010 --> 01:38:24.010]  Figueres, saying that US democracy was detrimental.
[01:38:24.010 --> 01:38:28.010]  So in the context of the Great Reset, here it is in one sentence, Alex.
[01:38:28.010 --> 01:38:30.010]  I've tried to simplify this.
[01:38:30.010 --> 01:38:35.010]  March of 2020 literally turned the once free West
[01:38:35.010 --> 01:38:38.010]  into one-party Chinese authoritarian rule.
[01:38:38.010 --> 01:38:39.010]  It's that simple.
[01:38:39.010 --> 01:38:41.010]  It was Donald Trump's greatest blunder.
[01:38:41.010 --> 01:38:44.010]  In fact, I would argue the day Donald Trump signed the COVID emergency declaration,
[01:38:44.010 --> 01:38:47.010]  he literally ended his presidency.
[01:38:47.010 --> 01:38:49.010]  Done, kaput, finished.
[01:38:49.010 --> 01:38:52.010]  We now know that Deborah Birx and Anthony Fauci
[01:38:52.010 --> 01:38:56.010]  brag about how they duped Donald Trump into the 10 days to flatten the curve.
[01:38:56.010 --> 01:38:58.010]  That was, yeah, but once that happened,
[01:38:58.010 --> 01:39:02.010]  every governor and mayor became a dictator overnight.
[01:39:02.010 --> 01:39:07.010]  The most consequential decisions of our lifetime outside of war were decided.
[01:39:08.010 --> 01:39:11.010]  And you're right, I love Trump, but he will not say he was wrong.
[01:39:11.010 --> 01:39:14.010]  He's starting to a little bit, but that is the fly in the ointment.
[01:39:14.010 --> 01:39:16.010]  That's the turd in the punch bowl.
[01:39:16.010 --> 01:39:18.010]  Yes, and he ended his presidency then.
[01:39:18.010 --> 01:39:20.010]  That allowed the mail-in balloting.
[01:39:20.010 --> 01:39:23.010]  It allowed the whole, you know, all the censorship.
[01:39:23.010 --> 01:39:25.010]  It allowed the crushing of the economy.
[01:39:25.010 --> 01:39:27.010]  He had one of the greatest economies in 50 years.
[01:39:27.010 --> 01:39:28.010]  He truly did.
[01:39:28.010 --> 01:39:30.010]  Lowest black Hispanic unemployment.
[01:39:30.010 --> 01:39:32.010]  But he wanted to be a savior and save people.
[01:39:32.010 --> 01:39:34.010]  He believed the medical system.
[01:39:34.010 --> 01:39:36.010]  He didn't know it was captured.
[01:39:36.010 --> 01:39:39.010]  Well, I think instinctively he was always against it,
[01:39:39.010 --> 01:39:43.010]  but he just, you know, the fact that Anthony Fauci never got fired by Donald Trump.
[01:39:43.010 --> 01:39:44.010]  Anyway, I don't want to get in.
[01:39:44.010 --> 01:39:46.010]  That's not really what I'm here to get.
[01:39:46.010 --> 01:39:50.010]  You're being honest that Trump sunk us and himself.
[01:39:50.010 --> 01:39:53.010]  Yeah, and the lowest point of his presidency was Larry Kudlow,
[01:39:53.010 --> 01:39:57.010]  top economic advisor, went on CNBC, and this is in my book.
[01:39:57.010 --> 01:40:01.010]  He was asked in, I think it was like third week of April 2020,
[01:40:01.010 --> 01:40:04.010]  when are we going to open up the U.S. economy again?
[01:40:04.010 --> 01:40:08.010]  And Donald Trump, the most conservative U.S. president, at least since Ronald Reagan,
[01:40:08.010 --> 01:40:12.010]  his advisor, Donald Trump's advisor, Larry Kudlow, said on live TV,
[01:40:12.010 --> 01:40:14.010]  I don't know when the economy is going to open up.
[01:40:14.010 --> 01:40:16.010]  That's up to the medical doctors.
[01:40:16.010 --> 01:40:18.010]  That was it.
[01:40:18.010 --> 01:40:20.010]  That was our moment of transformation.
[01:40:20.010 --> 01:40:23.010]  So he handed it over to a group of U.N., Bill Gates, globalist doctors,
[01:40:23.010 --> 01:40:25.010]  making it a medical dictatorship.
[01:40:25.010 --> 01:40:30.010]  So Trump advocated his presidency to them at that point.
[01:40:30.010 --> 01:40:33.010]  Yes, and that was when I realized, holy shit,
[01:40:33.010 --> 01:40:36.010]  this is Trump's top economic advisor basically saying,
[01:40:36.010 --> 01:40:39.010]  we don't know, not the government.
[01:40:39.010 --> 01:40:41.010]  The economy is going to open.
[01:40:41.010 --> 01:40:42.010]  Our freedoms are back.
[01:40:42.010 --> 01:40:43.010]  It's up to the doctors.
[01:40:43.010 --> 01:40:46.010]  Let me add, because sometimes explosives are needed.
[01:40:46.010 --> 01:40:48.010]  Holy fucking shit.
[01:40:48.010 --> 01:40:50.010]  There you go, yeah.
[01:40:50.010 --> 01:40:51.010]  It's true.
[01:40:51.010 --> 01:40:53.010]  And so what ended up happening, so in a nutshell,
[01:40:53.010 --> 01:40:57.010]  March of 2020 turned the one-street-west into one-party Chinese rule.
[01:40:57.010 --> 01:40:59.010]  So the most consequential decision, church closures, school closures,
[01:40:59.010 --> 01:41:03.010]  work closures, stay-at-home orders, canceling of medical procedures,
[01:41:03.010 --> 01:41:06.010]  backyard barbecues, vaccine mandates, mask mandates,
[01:41:06.010 --> 01:41:08.010]  it opened the door to all of that.
[01:41:08.010 --> 01:41:12.010]  Not a single ounce of democracy was applied to any of that.
[01:41:12.010 --> 01:41:14.010]  And what do you think the climate activists thought?
[01:41:14.010 --> 01:41:18.010]  Did they say, oh, this is bad, this has gone too far?
[01:41:18.010 --> 01:41:19.010]  No.
[01:41:19.010 --> 01:41:21.010]  Jamie Orgolis, Teen Vogue magazine,
[01:41:21.010 --> 01:41:25.010]  if we can shut down the world for a virus, we can do the same for climate.
[01:41:25.010 --> 01:41:31.010]  John Kerry actually said the parallels between COVID and climate are screaming at us.
[01:41:31.010 --> 01:41:32.010]  And from then on.
[01:41:32.010 --> 01:41:33.010]  That's what they said.
[01:41:33.010 --> 01:41:35.010]  Next is climate lockdowns.
[01:41:35.010 --> 01:41:36.010]  Yes.
[01:41:36.010 --> 01:41:37.010]  And so we know that happened.
[01:41:37.010 --> 01:41:39.010]  So in a nutshell, that's what happened.
[01:41:39.010 --> 01:41:40.010]  Now, there's always been throughout history.
[01:41:40.010 --> 01:41:44.010]  In my book, I quote a BBC historian who says,
[01:41:44.010 --> 01:41:47.010]  since thousands of years go back to the Roman Republic,
[01:41:47.010 --> 01:41:51.010]  its descent into an empire was due to the abuse of emergency power.
[01:41:51.010 --> 01:41:53.010]  If you go through the Middle Ages,
[01:41:53.010 --> 01:41:55.010]  centralization of power was through abuse of emergency power.
[01:41:55.010 --> 01:42:00.010]  Hitler's rise to power and consolidation of power in the 1930s
[01:42:00.010 --> 01:42:02.010]  was due to the abuse of emergency power.
[01:42:02.010 --> 01:42:05.010]  George probably now, you know,
[01:42:05.010 --> 01:42:09.010]  I would argue he's worse than Joe Biden and President Obama
[01:42:09.010 --> 01:42:14.010]  for what he did with the Patriot Act and with the 9-11 emergency declarations
[01:42:14.010 --> 01:42:15.010]  and our loss of liberties.
[01:42:15.010 --> 01:42:18.010]  His presidency paved the way for the Biden administration
[01:42:18.010 --> 01:42:21.010]  to declare angry parents at school board meetings
[01:42:21.010 --> 01:42:24.010]  fighting transgender ideology and critical race
[01:42:24.010 --> 01:42:28.010]  and COVID theater masking and other COVID theater
[01:42:28.010 --> 01:42:32.010]  to be called declared domestic terrorists.
[01:42:32.010 --> 01:42:36.010]  So George W. Bush was still living under that 9-11 emergency declaration.
[01:42:36.010 --> 01:42:37.010]  That's right.
[01:42:37.010 --> 01:42:38.010]  First it was take your rights to fight the Russians
[01:42:38.010 --> 01:42:40.010]  and take your rights to fight the Muslims
[01:42:40.010 --> 01:42:42.010]  and then now take your rights because you're an American patriot.
[01:42:42.010 --> 01:42:45.010]  So you're the expert no more than I do and few do.
[01:42:45.010 --> 01:42:46.010]  I'm just saying this.
[01:42:46.010 --> 01:42:47.010]  It's true.
[01:42:47.010 --> 01:42:48.010]  I totally respect you.
[01:42:48.010 --> 01:42:50.010]  Back up and I'll give you the floor after this.
[01:42:50.010 --> 01:42:51.010]  35,000 foot view.
[01:42:51.010 --> 01:42:53.010]  How is it going for the globalists?
[01:42:53.010 --> 01:42:55.010]  It seems to me like they're getting a lot done
[01:42:55.010 --> 01:42:57.010]  but it's waking people up fast.
[01:42:57.010 --> 01:42:59.010]  A lot of leaders are opposing them.
[01:42:59.010 --> 01:43:01.010]  No, that's actually true.
[01:43:01.010 --> 01:43:04.010]  They're the red pilling and here's I'll give you an example
[01:43:04.010 --> 01:43:07.010]  of the greatest red pill of this decade.
[01:43:07.010 --> 01:43:08.010]  Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[01:43:08.010 --> 01:43:10.010]  He's got a lot of issues.
[01:43:10.010 --> 01:43:13.010]  I love him on the world health.
[01:43:13.010 --> 01:43:14.010]  I love him on Bill Gates.
[01:43:14.010 --> 01:43:19.010]  I love him on free speech and going after public health tyranny.
[01:43:19.010 --> 01:43:22.010]  He's got a lot of problems when it comes to some other environmental issues
[01:43:22.010 --> 01:43:24.010]  but on climate, here's what he did.
[01:43:24.010 --> 01:43:25.010]  I interviewed Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[01:43:25.010 --> 01:43:26.010]  2014.
[01:43:26.010 --> 01:43:30.010]  He told me that he wanted to jail energy CEOs at The Hague
[01:43:30.010 --> 01:43:32.010]  with three square meals and a cot.
[01:43:32.010 --> 01:43:33.010]  He wanted to jail politicians.
[01:43:33.010 --> 01:43:34.010]  That's right.
[01:43:34.010 --> 01:43:37.010]  You got the famous totalitarian clip where he said arrest energy officials.
[01:43:37.010 --> 01:43:40.010]  Now he says the environmental movement's a power grab
[01:43:40.010 --> 01:43:43.010]  to starve people and create a new feudalism.
[01:43:43.010 --> 01:43:45.010]  He's come a long way.
[01:43:45.010 --> 01:43:46.010]  He has.
[01:43:46.010 --> 01:43:47.010]  In fact, he goes further.
[01:43:47.010 --> 01:43:50.010]  He says I will not talk about climate during this campaign.
[01:43:50.010 --> 01:43:52.010]  I will not try to convince you about climate change.
[01:43:52.010 --> 01:43:55.010]  It doesn't work anyway.
[01:43:55.010 --> 01:43:59.010]  He went on to say climate change has been hijacked by the world economic forum
[01:43:59.010 --> 01:44:02.010]  and the United Nations for totalitarian control of society.
[01:44:02.010 --> 01:44:07.010]  But on that stage could have adopted Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s position.
[01:44:07.010 --> 01:44:10.010]  By the way, Mark, I'm going to shut up because you're so smart,
[01:44:10.010 --> 01:44:11.010]  but I've got to say this.
[01:44:11.010 --> 01:44:14.010]  I think you think your external mic is on, the one on your lapel.
[01:44:14.010 --> 01:44:15.010]  I don't think it is.
[01:44:15.010 --> 01:44:19.010]  When you hit the table, it's cutting out three, four seconds of what you say.
[01:44:19.010 --> 01:44:21.010]  That's why I've been cutting in to give it time to come back.
[01:44:21.010 --> 01:44:23.010]  So maybe during a break we'll fix that.
[01:44:23.010 --> 01:44:24.010]  Your audio sounds great, by the way.
[01:44:24.010 --> 01:44:27.010]  It's just that when you hit the table, it's cutting you out.
[01:44:27.010 --> 01:44:28.010]  Go ahead.
[01:44:28.010 --> 01:44:30.010]  I got rid of the mic, so hopefully that's gone now.
[01:44:30.010 --> 01:44:32.010]  No, no, it got worse.
[01:44:32.010 --> 01:44:33.010]  It's fine.
[01:44:33.010 --> 01:44:34.010]  It's live radio TV.
[01:44:34.010 --> 01:44:35.010]  Everybody loves it.
[01:44:35.010 --> 01:44:36.010]  Go back to the lapel mic.
[01:44:36.010 --> 01:44:37.010]  We're not sure what the problem is.
[01:44:37.010 --> 01:44:38.010]  We'll break in 15 minutes.
[01:44:38.010 --> 01:44:39.010]  We'll fix it.
[01:44:39.010 --> 01:44:40.010]  Put the lapel mic back on.
[01:44:40.010 --> 01:44:41.010]  It got worse.
[01:44:41.010 --> 01:44:42.010]  Okay.
[01:44:42.010 --> 01:44:43.010]  No big deal.
[01:44:43.010 --> 01:44:44.010]  We're live.
[01:44:44.010 --> 01:44:45.010]  This is what people love this.
[01:44:45.010 --> 01:44:46.010]  It's not a problem.
[01:44:46.010 --> 01:44:49.010]  It's just that when you hit the table, five seconds cuts out.
[01:44:49.010 --> 01:44:50.010]  Start over.
[01:44:50.010 --> 01:44:52.010]  I'm going to put a sock in my mouth and shut up.
[01:44:52.010 --> 01:44:53.010]  You're just so dead on.
[01:44:53.010 --> 01:44:54.010]  Keep going.
[01:44:54.010 --> 01:44:57.010]  Anyway, so I think you're right, though.
[01:44:57.010 --> 01:44:59.010]  People are waking up across the world.
[01:44:59.010 --> 01:45:02.010]  It all started, and I detail this in my book, too, The Great Reset.
[01:45:02.010 --> 01:45:05.010]  You go back and look at what happened at the school board.
[01:45:05.010 --> 01:45:12.010]  The great awakening, the great pushback in America came at the lowest level of American politics.
[01:45:12.010 --> 01:45:17.010]  Angry parents who, first of all, because of Zoom classes and their kids not going to
[01:45:17.010 --> 01:45:20.010]  school anymore, were realizing what was being taught.
[01:45:20.010 --> 01:45:25.010]  They were showing up in mass at these school board meetings, and they literally, because
[01:45:25.010 --> 01:45:29.010]  of the angry parents willing to get arrested, willing to be called domestic terrorists,
[01:45:29.010 --> 01:45:33.010]  they toppled the Democrat Party machine in Virginia led by Terry McAuliffe.
[01:45:33.010 --> 01:45:34.010]  They almost toppled it in New Jersey.
[01:45:34.010 --> 01:45:36.010]  They toppled it in many other places.
[01:45:36.010 --> 01:45:43.010]  This so terrified the Democratic Party after the 2022 elections, the 2021 elections, that
[01:45:43.010 --> 01:45:47.010]  in every day, just according to New York Times, they did their own focus groups, the
[01:45:47.010 --> 01:45:53.010]  Democratic Party, and realized that they were waking an angry block of parents up that were
[01:45:53.010 --> 01:45:54.010]  about to turn against them.
[01:45:54.010 --> 01:45:58.010]  And that's what happened in Virginia when Terry McAuliffe, the former DNC chairman,
[01:45:58.010 --> 01:46:02.010]  went down in flames despite bringing in the teachers board unions and all this other
[01:46:02.010 --> 01:46:03.010]  stuff.
[01:46:03.010 --> 01:46:08.010]  So what happened was once the Democrats realized that that vaccine and mask mandates dropped
[01:46:08.010 --> 01:46:12.010]  in every major liberal city from San Francisco, L.A., Baltimore, Washington, Philadelphia,
[01:46:12.010 --> 01:46:18.010]  New York, Chicago, they realized this was they had overstepped their bounds.
[01:46:18.010 --> 01:46:20.010]  We have to thank for that.
[01:46:20.010 --> 01:46:22.010]  The parents at the lowest level of politics.
[01:46:22.010 --> 01:46:26.010]  So I think people have been red pilled, as I mentioned, even including Robert F.
[01:46:26.010 --> 01:46:27.010]  Kennedy Jr.
[01:46:27.010 --> 01:46:30.010]  There is a pushback that I'm hoping is arising.
[01:46:30.010 --> 01:46:35.010]  The other big area of hope is some Republican governors, and particularly Republican attorney
[01:46:35.010 --> 01:46:40.010]  generals, going after ESG, going after the whole, I don't want to use the word woke over
[01:46:40.010 --> 01:46:44.010]  and over, but the whole woke agenda, even stuff like central bank digital currency, which
[01:46:44.010 --> 01:46:45.010]  I talk about.
[01:46:45.010 --> 01:46:47.010]  And we can talk about that as well.
[01:46:47.010 --> 01:46:49.010]  But essentially, all that's good.
[01:46:49.010 --> 01:46:53.010]  But what's happened is, and this is where the crux of this is, and this is where people
[01:46:53.010 --> 01:46:54.010]  say, oh, it's a conspiracy.
[01:46:54.010 --> 01:46:56.010]  I was interviewed by a UK Channel 4 TV.
[01:46:56.010 --> 01:46:58.010]  This is a conspiracy theory.
[01:46:58.010 --> 01:47:03.010]  Not only is it not a conspiracy theory, it's conspiracy reality, but this is happening
[01:47:03.010 --> 01:47:04.010]  now.
[01:47:04.010 --> 01:47:07.010]  It's not something that could, might, may happen five or ten years.
[01:47:07.010 --> 01:47:13.010]  We're watching the intentional collapse, Alex, of our energy, our freedom of movement, our
[01:47:13.010 --> 01:47:17.010]  plentiful food supply, and our free speech, all simultaneously.
[01:47:17.010 --> 01:47:18.010]  And here's the kicker.
[01:47:18.010 --> 01:47:21.010]  Without a single vote of democracy.
[01:47:21.010 --> 01:47:23.010]  Now, you go back to the energy.
[01:47:23.010 --> 01:47:26.010]  You could argue that had some democracy because we were lied to.
[01:47:26.010 --> 01:47:29.010]  Solar and wind are so much cheaper, and we're going to have this utopian vision.
[01:47:29.010 --> 01:47:32.010]  And all these politicians were elected, so some of that was implemented.
[01:47:32.010 --> 01:47:35.010]  But when it comes to, let's start with the collapse of our transportation.
[01:47:35.010 --> 01:47:39.010]  Governor Newsom does an executive order banning gas-powered cars.
[01:47:39.010 --> 01:47:45.010]  The California Unelected Air Resources Board comes up with a timetable to get rid of it.
[01:47:45.010 --> 01:47:48.010]  About 17 states have a trigger law, including my home state of Virginia.
[01:47:48.010 --> 01:47:53.010]  Now with a Republican governor who's powerless to stop it because there's a Democrat Senate
[01:47:53.010 --> 01:47:54.010]  here.
[01:47:54.010 --> 01:47:55.010]  So we have these trigger laws.
[01:47:55.010 --> 01:47:57.010]  The Biden administration loves it so much.
[01:47:57.010 --> 01:47:59.010]  They're now implementing this through the EPA.
[01:47:59.010 --> 01:48:02.010]  Everything I just mentioned is completely unelected.
[01:48:02.010 --> 01:48:03.010]  It gets worse.
[01:48:03.010 --> 01:48:07.010]  And I've done a deep dive into what they've done with gas-powered car bans.
[01:48:07.010 --> 01:48:08.010]  Talk about it.
[01:48:08.010 --> 01:48:10.010]  Why are they cutting off all the energy?
[01:48:10.010 --> 01:48:15.010]  But meanwhile, if you're an electric car company in Missouri, then you get a coal power plant.
[01:48:15.010 --> 01:48:16.010]  Exactly.
[01:48:16.010 --> 01:48:18.010]  They're backing these up with diesel generators.
[01:48:18.010 --> 01:48:21.010]  Carbon for me, not for thee.
[01:48:21.010 --> 01:48:22.010]  Yes.
[01:48:22.010 --> 01:48:23.010]  And that's a whole other thing.
[01:48:23.010 --> 01:48:25.010]  But I'm focusing right now on the democracy of this.
[01:48:25.010 --> 01:48:31.010]  So you have a bank meeting, the former head of the World Bank, telling automakers that
[01:48:31.010 --> 01:48:33.010]  they're not going to be able to fund gas-powered cars.
[01:48:33.010 --> 01:48:37.010]  Then you have corporate banks led by a corporate bank in Australia saying they're not going
[01:48:37.010 --> 01:48:40.010]  to give out car loans to people who buy gas-powered cars.
[01:48:40.010 --> 01:48:46.010]  Then you have Colorado cities in California and in Colorado and California cities banning
[01:48:46.010 --> 01:48:48.010]  the creation of new gas stations.
[01:48:48.010 --> 01:48:53.010]  So if you can still buy a gas-powered car, you still own one in 10 or 15 years, you're
[01:48:53.010 --> 01:48:57.010]  going to have gas station rationing and shortages.
[01:48:57.010 --> 01:49:00.010]  All of that I just mentioned was never done.
[01:49:00.010 --> 01:49:02.010]  Congress never voted on a gas-powered car ban.
[01:49:02.010 --> 01:49:06.010]  Even the California legislator never voted on a gas-powered car ban.
[01:49:06.010 --> 01:49:09.010]  This is just like COVID.
[01:49:09.010 --> 01:49:10.010]  Then you move forward.
[01:49:10.010 --> 01:49:12.010]  You look at what they're doing in agriculture.
[01:49:12.010 --> 01:49:15.010]  We saw what happened in Sri Lanka, the collapse, the overrunning of the presidential palace
[01:49:15.010 --> 01:49:20.010]  as they banned basically plentiful food supply with these draconian measures.
[01:49:20.010 --> 01:49:25.010]  The Prime Minister, who's a student of the World Economic Forum in Netherlands, Prime
[01:49:25.010 --> 01:49:31.010]  Minister Mark Ruud, imposed upon the judges of legal system health the net zero rules
[01:49:31.010 --> 01:49:32.010]  on their farmers.
[01:49:32.010 --> 01:49:37.010]  Up to 10,000 family-run generational farms going to be shut down, replaced with either
[01:49:37.010 --> 01:49:39.010]  no farming to create food shortages.
[01:49:39.010 --> 01:49:42.010]  The number one food producer in Europe, by the way, in the Netherlands.
[01:49:43.010 --> 01:49:46.010]  I want to get to Netherlands, but we don't have to wait for Netherlands and Ireland banning
[01:49:46.010 --> 01:49:47.010]  the cows.
[01:49:47.010 --> 01:49:48.010]  What about Sri Lanka?
[01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:49.010]  That was fast.
[01:49:49.010 --> 01:49:50.010]  That's right.
[01:49:50.010 --> 01:49:52.010]  In Sri Lanka, they did it and they collapsed the entire country.
[01:49:52.010 --> 01:49:53.010]  They haven't recovered yet.
[01:49:53.010 --> 01:49:58.010]  The whole presidential palace, as you're showing there, was overrun, the peasants as they were,
[01:49:58.010 --> 01:50:01.010]  the unwashed masses had had enough.
[01:50:01.010 --> 01:50:06.010]  What happened was in all these places, the Netherlands, they fought back.
[01:50:06.010 --> 01:50:10.010]  They have a coalition, a governing party with the farmers, but they were going to be replaced
[01:50:10.010 --> 01:50:16.010]  by these family equity asset, Bill Gates style billionaire run or Chinese farms.
[01:50:16.010 --> 01:50:21.010]  Then you have this exporting to Australia where we have people saying they're decimating
[01:50:21.010 --> 01:50:23.010]  the net zero climate rules, decimating Australian farming.
[01:50:23.010 --> 01:50:25.010]  They're going to Canada.
[01:50:25.010 --> 01:50:26.010]  And guess what?
[01:50:26.010 --> 01:50:31.010]  John Kerry in July of this year announces that U.S. agriculture, by the way, agriculture
[01:50:31.010 --> 01:50:32.010]  has been around thousands of years.
[01:50:32.010 --> 01:50:35.010]  Suddenly in 2023, it's not sustainable.
[01:50:35.010 --> 01:50:37.010]  The earth can't handle it anymore.
[01:50:37.010 --> 01:50:39.010]  It has to be top down central plan.
[01:50:39.010 --> 01:50:44.010]  John Kerry going after fertilizer, going after methane emissions from cows.
[01:50:44.010 --> 01:50:48.010]  They're going after high yield agriculture, which is plentiful food.
[01:50:48.010 --> 01:50:51.010]  And they're going after meat eating a part of this.
[01:50:51.010 --> 01:50:54.010]  Again, no vote of Congress on any of this.
[01:50:54.010 --> 01:50:58.010]  So as part of this, Bill Gates, according to NBC News, now America's single largest
[01:50:58.010 --> 01:51:02.010]  farmland owner, China, a close second buying up land.
[01:51:02.010 --> 01:51:03.010]  What is Bill Gates stated agenda?
[01:51:04.010 --> 01:51:09.010]  He told MIT Technology Review that he wants the entire Western world eating synthetic
[01:51:09.010 --> 01:51:10.010]  beef.
[01:51:10.010 --> 01:51:12.010]  That's the fake vegetable oil process.
[01:51:12.010 --> 01:51:17.010]  But more importantly, it includes he and Richard Branson, two billionaire investment in the
[01:51:17.010 --> 01:51:24.010]  lab grown meat grown in a petri dish from stem cells from a cow, sheep or pig mixed
[01:51:24.010 --> 01:51:30.010]  with fetal blood in a steel vat festered for months without eyes, without a brain, without
[01:51:30.010 --> 01:51:31.010]  bone structure.
[01:51:31.010 --> 01:51:33.010]  We're talking an amorphous blob.
[01:51:33.010 --> 01:51:34.010]  Think Kevin McCarthy's moot.
[01:51:34.010 --> 01:51:39.010]  Not Kevin, not the current Kevin McCarthy, but the 1950s sci fi starring actor Kevin
[01:51:39.010 --> 01:51:41.010]  McCarthy, Invasion of the Body Snatchers.
[01:51:41.010 --> 01:51:47.010]  They're growing meat pods in a laboratory that then the World Economic Forum brags.
[01:51:47.010 --> 01:51:52.010]  You can then get this lab grown meat and print it on a 3D printer, 10 kilograms an
[01:51:52.010 --> 01:51:53.010]  hour, whatever the number was.
[01:51:53.010 --> 01:51:55.010]  And you're going to add all sorts of additives.
[01:51:55.010 --> 01:51:58.010]  And by the way, Mark, let me just interrupt you since you raised this.
[01:51:58.010 --> 01:52:00.010]  I've been good for five minutes and you're riveting.
[01:52:00.010 --> 01:52:06.010]  They're using immortal stem cell lines in some of the artificial chicken and beef from
[01:52:06.010 --> 01:52:11.010]  Henrietta Lacks, who had these immortal cells that literally like the blob ate her in a
[01:52:11.010 --> 01:52:14.010]  few weeks in the 50s to then grow it in these vats.
[01:52:14.010 --> 01:52:17.010]  So it's actually cancer cells they're using to grow this.
[01:52:17.010 --> 01:52:18.010]  Can't make this up.
[01:52:18.010 --> 01:52:20.010]  I mean, who can make that up?
[01:52:20.010 --> 01:52:21.010]  Yeah.
[01:52:21.010 --> 01:52:24.010]  And one of the ideas that in order to make this profitable, because it's not profitable,
[01:52:24.010 --> 01:52:26.010]  that's why you need billionaire investments.
[01:52:26.010 --> 01:52:29.010]  They need to replicate this meat and make it grow.
[01:52:29.010 --> 01:52:32.010]  So they're trying to come up with the fastest way to replicate cells.
[01:52:32.010 --> 01:52:34.010]  So you get the most aggressive cancer cells ever.
[01:52:34.010 --> 01:52:35.010]  Yes.
[01:52:35.010 --> 01:52:36.010]  That's one of the fears of this.
[01:52:36.010 --> 01:52:37.010]  They haven't tested this.
[01:52:37.010 --> 01:52:38.010]  But guess what?
[01:52:38.010 --> 01:52:39.010]  Jeez.
[01:52:39.010 --> 01:52:40.010]  But let's just slow down.
[01:52:40.010 --> 01:52:41.010]  Let's just stop.
[01:52:41.010 --> 01:52:42.010]  Let's just stop.
[01:52:42.010 --> 01:52:45.010]  They're growing many of these with the most aggressive cancer cells ever seen.
[01:52:45.010 --> 01:52:47.010]  They're going to feed you cancer cells.
[01:52:47.010 --> 01:52:49.010]  What could go wrong?
[01:52:49.010 --> 01:52:50.010]  Exactly.
[01:52:50.010 --> 01:52:51.010]  And here's what else could go wrong.
[01:52:51.010 --> 01:52:53.010]  Well, here's what else is going wrong.
[01:52:53.010 --> 01:52:57.010]  Because Bill Gates and Richard Branson are behind it, the United States Department of
[01:52:57.010 --> 01:52:58.010]  Agriculture.
[01:52:58.010 --> 01:52:59.010]  They've already approved it now.
[01:52:59.010 --> 01:53:00.010]  They're starting with chicken.
[01:53:00.010 --> 01:53:02.010]  It's already been approved for human consumption.
[01:53:02.010 --> 01:53:05.010]  Heretofore never approved before.
[01:53:05.010 --> 01:53:06.010]  The lab-grown meat is one.
[01:53:06.010 --> 01:53:08.010]  Then, of course, you have the insect eating.
[01:53:08.010 --> 01:53:12.010]  The insect eating, World Economic Forum, UN, have been pushing this for decades.
[01:53:12.010 --> 01:53:15.010]  I mean, they really want to do this.
[01:53:15.010 --> 01:53:17.010]  But now they've made their move.
[01:53:17.010 --> 01:53:18.010]  It's everywhere.
[01:53:18.010 --> 01:53:19.010]  Eat the bugs.
[01:53:19.010 --> 01:53:20.010]  It's wonderful.
[01:53:20.010 --> 01:53:22.010]  They're already putting in a lot of products.
[01:53:22.010 --> 01:53:23.010]  They are.
[01:53:24.010 --> 01:53:26.010]  God bless Georgia Maloney in Italy, the prime minister.
[01:53:26.010 --> 01:53:28.010]  She said absolutely no to the insects.
[01:53:28.010 --> 01:53:32.010]  She said Italian pasta will not be made with mealworm powder.
[01:53:32.010 --> 01:53:36.010]  They're the only ones I'm aware of in Europe fighting back against this agenda.
[01:53:36.010 --> 01:53:38.010]  But it's insidious.
[01:53:38.010 --> 01:53:44.010]  Throughout Europe, and particularly Australia, a thousand school systems have the activists
[01:53:44.010 --> 01:53:46.010]  come in with these cricket-based chips.
[01:53:46.010 --> 01:53:47.010]  And they look like a potato chip.
[01:53:47.010 --> 01:53:48.010]  They're greased, salt.
[01:53:48.010 --> 01:53:51.010]  You would never know it's made from cricket-milled flour.
[01:53:51.010 --> 01:53:53.010]  But it's a psyop, Alex.
[01:53:53.010 --> 01:53:55.010]  They give the kids these crickets.
[01:53:55.010 --> 01:53:56.010]  The kids eat them.
[01:53:56.010 --> 01:54:00.010]  And they're told, and this is in the article, to, quote, pester their parents that insects
[01:54:00.010 --> 01:54:02.010]  taste great and are delicious.
[01:54:02.010 --> 01:54:03.010]  Let's go further.
[01:54:03.010 --> 01:54:06.010]  So they're not just trying to turn them into transgenders or cut their testicles off.
[01:54:06.010 --> 01:54:08.010]  They're trying to feed them toxic chitin.
[01:54:08.010 --> 01:54:12.010]  What about the studies that the bug exoskeletons are highly toxic?
[01:54:12.010 --> 01:54:17.010]  Highly toxic and a much higher allergy rate they're finding than even things like peanuts
[01:54:17.010 --> 01:54:18.010]  and shellfish.
[01:54:18.010 --> 01:54:19.010]  So that's another thing.
[01:54:19.010 --> 01:54:20.010]  But hey, they're being approved for use.
[01:54:20.010 --> 01:54:24.010]  So somehow, these billionaire investors, I don't know how it works, Alex.
[01:54:24.010 --> 01:54:26.010]  This may have never happened in U.S. history.
[01:54:26.010 --> 01:54:28.010]  They're forcing, they're juicing the skids.
[01:54:28.010 --> 01:54:31.010]  So the U.S. government just seems to be approving all of this.
[01:54:31.010 --> 01:54:33.010]  Rubber stamping the insects.
[01:54:33.010 --> 01:54:35.010]  Rubber stamping the lab-grown meat.
[01:54:35.010 --> 01:54:36.010]  You know, I'm being sarcastic.
[01:54:36.010 --> 01:54:38.010]  Look, look, look.
[01:54:38.010 --> 01:54:39.010]  It's a revolution.
[01:54:39.010 --> 01:54:42.010]  They're launching their globalist, elite, transhumanist agenda right now.
[01:54:42.010 --> 01:54:44.010]  Is that accurate?
[01:54:44.010 --> 01:54:45.010]  Absolutely.
[01:54:45.010 --> 01:54:46.010]  It is.
[01:54:46.010 --> 01:54:47.010]  It's exactly what's happening.
[01:54:47.010 --> 01:54:48.010]  So that's on the food part.
[01:54:48.010 --> 01:54:49.010]  Yeah, I've mentioned transportation.
[01:54:49.010 --> 01:54:51.010]  I don't hear something you may not know.
[01:54:51.010 --> 01:54:57.010]  The medical community is having their medical treatment is being intentionally rationed
[01:54:57.010 --> 01:54:58.010]  for net zero.
[01:54:58.010 --> 01:55:05.010]  American Cancer Society came out in 2020 literally in a statement about the carbon footprint
[01:55:05.010 --> 01:55:06.010]  of cancer care.
[01:55:06.010 --> 01:55:11.010]  And they're telling doctors they need to somehow come up with new ways to treat that lower
[01:55:11.010 --> 01:55:15.010]  the carbon footprint of your chemotherapy or whatever cancer treatment you're getting.
[01:55:15.010 --> 01:55:17.010]  Now, would you go to a doctor that…
[01:55:17.010 --> 01:55:18.010]  Mark, Mark, Mark, stay there.
[01:55:18.010 --> 01:55:20.010]  We're going to do 30 more minutes the next hour.
[01:55:20.010 --> 01:55:21.010]  Let's slow down.
[01:55:21.010 --> 01:55:23.010]  You are the leading expert, hands down.
[01:55:23.010 --> 01:55:25.010]  You're telling us what's going on.
[01:55:25.010 --> 01:55:28.010]  I want to talk about what they're doing, how we counter it, the general politics, your
[01:55:28.010 --> 01:55:29.010]  view next hour.
[01:55:29.010 --> 01:55:32.010]  But stop, because I read your book two weeks ago.
[01:55:32.010 --> 01:55:33.010]  I ordered it.
[01:55:33.010 --> 01:55:35.010]  My book is called The Great Reset.
[01:55:35.010 --> 01:55:36.010]  It's excellent in general knowledge.
[01:55:36.010 --> 01:55:40.010]  It has like 10% of the same stuff that you cover, but you've got 90% I didn't hit.
[01:55:40.010 --> 01:55:43.010]  Everybody needs to get Mark Moreno's The Great Reset.
[01:55:43.010 --> 01:55:44.010]  Absolutely critical.
[01:55:44.010 --> 01:55:46.010]  Tell us about the book.
[01:55:46.010 --> 01:55:47.010]  Well, thank you.
[01:55:47.010 --> 01:55:50.010]  Yeah, and by the way, I read your book too and really enjoyed it.
[01:55:50.010 --> 01:55:54.010]  You actually went through a very intellectual, historical perspective of it.
[01:55:54.010 --> 01:55:58.010]  What I did, I did a completely different take on The Great Reset.
[01:55:58.010 --> 01:56:00.010]  No, you just gave all the data.
[01:56:00.010 --> 01:56:04.010]  Yes, I went at it and I said, I looked at it this way, and this is what I do in my presentations.
[01:56:04.010 --> 01:56:09.010]  I want to tell the average person who's not following, has no history of looking back
[01:56:09.010 --> 01:56:13.010]  at the New World Order or, you know, Roosevelt's New Deal.
[01:56:13.010 --> 01:56:16.010]  Yeah, this was Great Reset for dummies.
[01:56:16.010 --> 01:56:17.010]  Yes, if you want to put it that way.
[01:56:17.010 --> 01:56:21.010]  So what I do, and that's what I'm saying, I use the mainstream sources of information
[01:56:21.010 --> 01:56:24.010]  so that I would never want to cite even a blog.
[01:56:24.010 --> 01:56:26.010]  I want to say, this is what The Washington Post did.
[01:56:26.010 --> 01:56:27.010]  This is what BBC said.
[01:56:27.010 --> 01:56:28.010]  This is what the UN says.
[01:56:28.010 --> 01:56:31.010]  This is what the World Health, and so I hit people.
[01:56:31.010 --> 01:56:35.010]  And by the way, I learned a lot from your book, and I'm immersed 15 hours a day, so
[01:56:35.010 --> 01:56:37.010]  your book is preeminent.
[01:56:37.010 --> 01:56:38.010]  Well, thank you.
[01:56:38.010 --> 01:56:42.010]  I appreciate that because I really tried to make a resource reference that's a fun, easy
[01:56:42.010 --> 01:56:43.010]  read.
[01:56:43.010 --> 01:56:48.010]  I opened the book with a quote from Rod Sterling of The Twilight Zone, talking about this is
[01:56:48.010 --> 01:56:52.010]  our future only if we allow it, and it's about a dystopian world.
[01:56:52.010 --> 01:56:58.010]  And I go to lay out everything from You Will Own Nothing, the equity asset firms, even
[01:56:58.010 --> 01:56:59.010]  things like Coke and Pepsi.
[01:56:59.010 --> 01:57:01.010]  You think they're two competing companies.
[01:57:01.010 --> 01:57:06.010]  At their core, when stripped away, they're actually owned by the same essentially equity
[01:57:06.010 --> 01:57:07.010]  asset firms.
[01:57:07.010 --> 01:57:11.010]  I go through and show how real estate is now being gobbled up by equity asset, how we're
[01:57:11.010 --> 01:57:12.010]  going to be all turned into renters.
[01:57:12.010 --> 01:57:14.010]  It's a form of neo-feudalism.
[01:57:14.010 --> 01:57:18.010]  I go through the history of Anthony Fauci, of Bill Gates, Bill Gates being the number
[01:57:18.010 --> 01:57:20.010]  one funder of the World Health Organization.
[01:57:20.010 --> 01:57:21.010]  Mark Moreno, stay there.
[01:57:21.010 --> 01:57:27.010]  And of course, give people the best website for you, ClimateDepot.com, on Twitter, Climate
[01:57:27.010 --> 01:57:28.010]  Depot.
[01:57:28.010 --> 01:57:31.010]  Mark Moreno is the leading expert.
[01:57:31.010 --> 01:57:35.010]  Lord Moxton's still there, super expert, but quasi-retired.
[01:57:35.010 --> 01:57:37.010]  Mark Moreno is the man.
[01:57:37.010 --> 01:57:41.010]  We have the man exposing the enemy's main plan for control.
[01:57:41.010 --> 01:57:44.010]  Hour number three is two minutes away.
[01:57:44.010 --> 01:57:47.010]  Everybody you know, tune in now, now, now, now, now.
[01:57:49.010 --> 01:57:53.010]  Why do you think the globalists are desperately trying to censor everybody?
[01:57:53.010 --> 01:57:56.010]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk, everybody else?
[01:57:56.010 --> 01:58:01.010]  Because they can't get through this giant megalomaniacal power grab if we're here exposing
[01:58:01.010 --> 01:58:02.010]  them.
[01:58:02.010 --> 01:58:04.010]  But we're not just exposing their operation.
[01:58:04.010 --> 01:58:10.010]  In my new book, we give you the solutions to build a new, better world, an alternative
[01:58:10.010 --> 01:58:13.010]  to Klaus Schwab's, You Will Eat the Bugs.
[01:58:13.010 --> 01:58:18.010]  This is The Great Awakening, the plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great
[01:58:18.010 --> 01:58:19.010]  renaissance.
[01:58:19.010 --> 01:58:23.010]  It's a companion to my last book that was a number one worldwide bestseller.
[01:58:23.010 --> 01:58:26.010]  And this book is even thicker and even more powerful.
[01:58:26.010 --> 01:58:32.010]  Get your copy of The Great Awakening today at InfoWarsTore.com, either signed as a fundraiser,
[01:58:32.010 --> 01:58:34.010]  and I thank you for the support, or unsigned.

[01:58:40.010 --> 01:58:42.010]  So please, get the historic book now.
[01:58:42.010 --> 01:58:46.010]  Go now to InfoWarsTore.com and get The Great Awakening.
[01:58:46.010 --> 01:58:48.010]  The Great Awakening at InfoWarsTore.
[01:58:48.010 --> 01:58:50.010]  I didn't realize this was back this week.
[01:58:50.010 --> 01:58:51.010]  I thought it was next week.
[01:58:51.010 --> 01:58:54.010]  I come in this morning, it's back in the warehouse ready to roll.
[01:58:55.010 --> 01:58:57.010]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[01:58:57.010 --> 01:59:00.010]  And the first thing I did was pop one of these bad boys.
[01:59:01.010 --> 01:59:02.010]  Overhead shot, please.
[01:59:03.010 --> 01:59:06.010]  Look how full this bottle is.
[01:59:07.010 --> 01:59:09.010]  Right to the top, folks.
[01:59:10.010 --> 01:59:15.010]  Right to the top with these 95% curcuminoids.
[01:59:16.010 --> 01:59:20.010]  Again, most turmeric formulas are 5%, some are maybe 10.
[01:59:20.010 --> 01:59:23.010]  The other strongest brands are 75%.
[01:59:23.010 --> 01:59:26.010]  This is 95%.
[01:59:27.010 --> 01:59:28.010]  Super constant.
[01:59:28.010 --> 01:59:31.010]  So like taking one pill is like taking 10 of the average pill.
[01:59:32.010 --> 01:59:33.010]  It's that powerful.
[01:59:33.010 --> 01:59:34.010]  Or more.
[01:59:35.010 --> 01:59:37.010]  So they're available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:59:38.010 --> 01:59:40.010]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[01:59:41.010 --> 01:59:42.010]  Sold out for almost 8 months.
[01:59:42.010 --> 01:59:48.010]  Back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:59:50.010 --> 01:59:54.010]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:59:54.010 --> 01:59:56.010]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:25.010 --> 02:00:28.010]  Isn't it rich?
[02:00:29.010 --> 02:00:30.010]  All right.
[02:00:30.010 --> 02:00:31.010]  Mark Moreno's a very busy man.
[02:00:31.010 --> 02:00:32.010]  Hard to get on.
[02:00:32.010 --> 02:00:33.010]  I hope he'll join us again very soon.
[02:00:33.010 --> 02:00:34.010]  We got 30 more minutes left with him.
[02:00:35.010 --> 02:00:36.010]  This is a short segment.
[02:00:36.010 --> 02:00:37.010]  Two longer segments are coming up.
[02:00:38.010 --> 02:00:39.010]  But you notice he's excited, I'm excited.
[02:00:39.010 --> 02:00:43.010]  This is the global corporate BlackRock takeover plan.
[02:00:43.010 --> 02:00:44.010]  This is their whole play.
[02:00:44.010 --> 02:00:45.010]  This is their whole game.
[02:00:46.010 --> 02:00:50.010]  And man, is Mark Moreno and myself and many others not completely vindicated.
[02:00:50.010 --> 02:00:51.010]  It's out in the open now.
[02:00:51.010 --> 02:00:52.010]  So Mark, you got cut off by the break.
[02:00:52.010 --> 02:00:53.010]  Please continue.
[02:00:54.010 --> 02:00:55.010]  Oh, I think I was talking.
[02:00:55.010 --> 02:00:57.010]  Well, I was going to mention one other thing about cars.
[02:00:57.010 --> 02:01:00.010]  It's more important than just banning gas-powered cars.
[02:01:00.010 --> 02:01:04.010]  Boris Johnson's Transportation Secretary, as reported by the UK Daily Mail,
[02:01:04.010 --> 02:01:08.010]  said owning a car is outdated 20th century thinking.
[02:01:08.010 --> 02:01:13.010]  There have been multiple of these net zero reports talking about going after car ownership in general.
[02:01:13.010 --> 02:01:18.010]  So their goal is to force us into mass transit and to get us into these little, you know,
[02:01:18.010 --> 02:01:20.010]  calling up a zip car or something to take you.
[02:01:20.010 --> 02:01:23.010]  They're going directly after you'll go nowhere and be happy.
[02:01:23.010 --> 02:01:26.010]  But I think right before the break, I was talking about the medical angle of this.
[02:01:26.010 --> 02:01:28.010]  Medical care is in the crosshairs.
[02:01:28.010 --> 02:01:33.010]  So the American Cancer Society fretting about the carbon footprint of cancer care in 2020.
[02:01:33.010 --> 02:01:40.010]  Fast forward to this year, Alex, we now have a major cancer drug shortage in the United States.
[02:01:40.010 --> 02:01:43.010]  The American Cancer Society got its eye off the ball,
[02:01:43.010 --> 02:01:48.010]  started worrying about carbon footprints of their care and not supply chain issues
[02:01:48.010 --> 02:01:50.010]  and worried about what treatments were best.
[02:01:50.010 --> 02:01:54.010]  So now guess what happens for the first time in cancer care treatment?
[02:01:54.010 --> 02:01:57.010]  We're now having China bail us out.
[02:01:57.010 --> 02:01:59.010]  So once again, China benefits from solar.
[02:01:59.010 --> 02:02:03.010]  But that's the plan. This isn't by accident, as you've written in your book.
[02:02:03.010 --> 02:02:07.010]  90% of the solar panels, all the car parts that are made there,
[02:02:07.010 --> 02:02:11.010]  they've set it up where they've got coal power plants building all this crap.
[02:02:11.010 --> 02:02:13.010]  It's a fraud.
[02:02:13.010 --> 02:02:17.010]  And then you have Pope Francis come out today with his new climate encyclical,
[02:02:18.010 --> 02:02:23.010]  carbon footprint per person and demonizing America, coming right at America,
[02:02:23.010 --> 02:02:27.010]  basically buying into the whole, I call it the unholy alliance between Pope Francis
[02:02:27.010 --> 02:02:29.010]  and the Catholic and his Catholic.
[02:02:29.010 --> 02:02:31.010]  Francis is at war with his own conservative Catholic base.
[02:02:31.010 --> 02:02:35.010]  So who's he an agent of from your research?
[02:02:35.010 --> 02:02:37.010]  Well, he is a first thing.
[02:02:37.010 --> 02:02:42.010]  He is a Latin American poverty socialist perspective.
[02:02:42.010 --> 02:02:45.010]  So everything he looks at, he tries to talk about the science,
[02:02:45.010 --> 02:02:48.010]  but he doesn't really care that much about the climate science.
[02:02:48.010 --> 02:02:52.010]  He cares about the fact that the solutions proposed by the United Nations
[02:02:52.010 --> 02:02:56.010]  is essentially a statist, socialist, one world government,
[02:02:56.010 --> 02:02:58.010]  because that's his entire worldview.
[02:02:58.010 --> 02:03:00.010]  I don't know exactly who's behind it,
[02:03:00.010 --> 02:03:04.010]  but I can tell you that there was a purge of a lot of the conservative cardinals
[02:03:04.010 --> 02:03:06.010]  who worked at the Vatican who were surrounding him.
[02:03:06.010 --> 02:03:09.010]  They literally got rid of them because the two previous popes,
[02:03:09.010 --> 02:03:13.010]  Benedict and John Paul II, literally had climate summits
[02:03:13.010 --> 02:03:16.010]  where they featured climate skeptics, and they actually had debates.
[02:03:16.010 --> 02:03:20.010]  Yeah, I mean, John Paul was a polar opposite from this current pope.
[02:03:20.010 --> 02:03:22.010]  He was.
[02:03:22.010 --> 02:03:27.010]  Back to the 2015 Vatican Climate Summit, co-sponsored with the United Nations.
[02:03:27.010 --> 02:03:31.010]  I tried to ask the Secretary General a couple inconvenient questions
[02:03:31.010 --> 02:03:33.010]  about their unholy alliance.
[02:03:33.010 --> 02:03:38.010]  I was told by United Nations armed security
[02:03:38.010 --> 02:03:41.010]  that they were going to remove me from Vatican City
[02:03:42.010 --> 02:03:45.010]  to have me removed if I didn't cease and desist.
[02:03:45.010 --> 02:03:49.010]  That was how the Vatican Climate Summit went for me when I was there in 2015.
[02:03:49.010 --> 02:03:54.010]  But this was Pope Francis getting in bed with everything Catholic teachings,
[02:03:54.010 --> 02:03:58.010]  and I'm Catholic, everything Catholic teachings is opposed to.
[02:03:58.010 --> 02:04:01.010]  This would be the one world government, the pro-abortionists,
[02:04:01.010 --> 02:04:03.010]  the population control, the contraception.
[02:04:03.010 --> 02:04:05.010]  You name it, all the way down the list,
[02:04:05.010 --> 02:04:08.010]  he made this unholy alliance to work with them
[02:04:08.010 --> 02:04:11.010]  because he seems to care more about the economics
[02:04:11.010 --> 02:04:15.010]  and enforcing this essentially redistribution of wealth
[02:04:15.010 --> 02:04:18.010]  through the United Nations, through a global governance structure.
[02:04:18.010 --> 02:04:21.010]  That's what, unfortunately, what Pope Francis is about.
[02:04:21.010 --> 02:04:24.010]  And I'm now working with a bunch of, I guess you'd say,
[02:04:24.010 --> 02:04:26.010]  conservative or dissident Catholics.
[02:04:26.010 --> 02:04:28.010]  We're having an event in Baltimore next month
[02:04:28.010 --> 02:04:30.010]  to push back both against Pope Francis
[02:04:30.010 --> 02:04:32.010]  and the U.S. Catholic Conference of Bishops,
[02:04:32.010 --> 02:04:35.010]  who basically say there's no dissent on this issue.
[02:04:35.010 --> 02:04:38.010]  They're trying to raise, many Catholics are trying to raise,
[02:04:38.010 --> 02:04:40.010]  Pope Francis' words on climate,
[02:04:40.010 --> 02:04:44.010]  which is not speaking from his authority on faith and morals.
[02:04:44.010 --> 02:04:47.010]  Well, sure, say what you want about nobody's perfect, but Catholics,
[02:04:47.010 --> 02:04:49.010]  they've always been pro-life and pro-population.
[02:04:49.010 --> 02:04:51.010]  Now he's anti-population.
[02:04:51.010 --> 02:04:53.010]  Mark Moreno, back in 60 seconds.
[02:04:53.010 --> 02:04:54.010]  Please stay with us.
[02:04:54.010 --> 02:04:55.010]  This is critical.
[02:04:55.010 --> 02:04:57.010]  We'll talk about solutions and more straight ahead.
[02:04:57.010 --> 02:04:58.010]  Stay with us.
[02:04:58.010 --> 02:04:59.010]  Okay.
[02:04:59.010 --> 02:05:03.010]  Where were you when humanity was fighting for its life?
[02:05:04.010 --> 02:05:06.010]  Where were you when the globalists were caught
[02:05:06.010 --> 02:05:09.010]  trafficking millions of children for sex slavery worldwide?
[02:05:09.010 --> 02:05:12.010]  Where were you when the New World Order was starting World War III with Russia?
[02:05:12.010 --> 02:05:13.010]  Well, I know where you are.
[02:05:13.010 --> 02:05:16.010]  You're watching and listening to Infowars.com right now,
[02:05:16.010 --> 02:05:18.010]  and I salute you and thank you.
[02:05:18.010 --> 02:05:21.010]  And I want to encourage all of you who've been in this fight so long
[02:05:21.010 --> 02:05:24.010]  to realize we've reached the critical juncture in the battle now.
[02:05:24.010 --> 02:05:28.010]  And a key tool in that fight is the Great Awakening,
[02:05:28.010 --> 02:05:31.010]  defeating the globalists, and launching the next great renaissance.
[02:05:31.010 --> 02:05:35.010]  This is my second book, Part II to the Great Reset and the War for the World.
[02:05:35.010 --> 02:05:38.010]  It's a longer book, quite frankly, a more powerful book.
[02:05:38.010 --> 02:05:41.010]  And just like the last book went to number one,
[02:05:41.010 --> 02:05:43.010]  it is up to you to set it to number one right now.
[02:05:43.010 --> 02:05:45.010]  This is a cultural fight against the globalists,
[02:05:45.010 --> 02:05:47.010]  and it funds the Infowar.
[02:05:47.010 --> 02:05:53.010]  Get signed or unsigned copies of The Great Awakening right now at Infowars.com.
[02:05:53.010 --> 02:05:55.010]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:05:55.010 --> 02:05:56.010]  This is a book everybody needs.
[02:05:56.010 --> 02:05:58.010]  Get your copy of The Great Awakening right now.
[02:06:02.010 --> 02:06:04.010]  Obsolete, Mr. Wordsworth.
[02:06:04.010 --> 02:06:07.010]  Why? No man is obsolete.
[02:06:07.010 --> 02:06:09.010]  You have no function, Mr. Wordsworth.
[02:06:09.010 --> 02:06:12.010]  You're an anachronism, like a ghost from another time.
[02:06:12.010 --> 02:06:14.010]  I am nothing more than a reminder to you
[02:06:14.010 --> 02:06:18.010]  that you cannot destroy truth by burning pages.
[02:06:18.010 --> 02:06:21.010]  You're a bug, Mr. Wordsworth, a crawling insect,
[02:06:21.010 --> 02:06:25.010]  an ugly, misformed little creature who has no purpose here, no meaning.
[02:06:25.010 --> 02:06:27.010]  I am a human being.
[02:06:27.010 --> 02:06:29.010]  You're a librarian.
[02:06:29.010 --> 02:06:30.010]  You're a human being.
[02:06:30.010 --> 02:06:32.010]  You're a librarian, Mr. Wordsworth.
[02:06:32.010 --> 02:06:35.010]  You're a dealer in books and two-cent fines
[02:06:35.010 --> 02:06:37.010]  and pamphlets and clothes stacks
[02:06:37.010 --> 02:06:39.010]  and the musty insides of a language factory
[02:06:39.010 --> 02:06:42.010]  that spews out meaningless words on an assembly line.
[02:06:42.010 --> 02:06:45.010]  Words, Mr. Wordsworth,
[02:06:45.010 --> 02:06:48.010]  that have no substance and no dimension,
[02:06:48.010 --> 02:06:50.010]  like air, like the wind,
[02:06:50.010 --> 02:06:53.010]  like a vacuum that you make believe has an existence
[02:06:53.010 --> 02:06:56.010]  by scribbling index numbers on little cards.
[02:06:56.010 --> 02:06:57.010]  I don't care.
[02:06:57.010 --> 02:06:58.010]  I tell you, I don't care.
[02:06:58.010 --> 02:06:59.010]  I'm a human being.
[02:06:59.010 --> 02:07:01.010]  I exist.
[02:07:01.010 --> 02:07:03.010]  And if I speak one thought aloud,
[02:07:03.010 --> 02:07:05.010]  that thought lives,
[02:07:05.010 --> 02:07:07.010]  even after I'm shoveled into my grave.
[02:07:07.010 --> 02:07:10.010]  Delusions, Mr. Wordsworth,
[02:07:10.010 --> 02:07:15.010]  delusions that you inject into your veins with printer's ink,
[02:07:15.010 --> 02:07:18.010]  the narcotics that you call literature,
[02:07:18.010 --> 02:07:20.010]  the Bible, poetry,
[02:07:20.010 --> 02:07:22.010]  essays of all kind, all of it,
[02:07:22.010 --> 02:07:25.010]  and opiates that make you think you have a strength...
[02:07:26.010 --> 02:07:29.010]  Mark Moreno, former top Senate advisor to the Republicans,
[02:07:29.010 --> 02:07:30.010]  decades ago,
[02:07:30.010 --> 02:07:32.010]  been in this guy for 25 years,
[02:07:32.010 --> 02:07:34.010]  predicting everything that's now happened.
[02:07:34.010 --> 02:07:36.010]  Here, another little clip of the obsolete man.
[02:07:36.010 --> 02:07:39.010]  We got another 25 minutes left with our guest.
[02:07:39.010 --> 02:07:42.010]  The 1960s, with Rod Serling, a great patriot,
[02:07:42.010 --> 02:07:45.010]  predicting how tyranny would come to America.
[02:07:49.010 --> 02:07:52.010]  You walk into this room at your own risk
[02:07:52.010 --> 02:07:54.010]  because it leads to the future,
[02:07:54.010 --> 02:07:57.010]  not a future that will be, but one that might be.
[02:07:57.010 --> 02:07:59.010]  This is not a new world.
[02:07:59.010 --> 02:08:04.010]  It is simply an extension of what began in the old one.
[02:08:04.010 --> 02:08:06.010]  It has patterned itself after every dictator
[02:08:06.010 --> 02:08:10.010]  who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a...
[02:08:10.010 --> 02:08:12.010]  since the beginning of time.
[02:08:12.010 --> 02:08:15.010]  It has refinements, technological advances,
[02:08:15.010 --> 02:08:17.010]  and a more sophisticated approach
[02:08:17.010 --> 02:08:20.010]  to the destruction of human freedom.
[02:08:20.010 --> 02:08:23.010]  But like every one of the super states that preceded it,
[02:08:23.010 --> 02:08:25.010]  it has one iron rule.
[02:08:25.010 --> 02:08:29.010]  Logic is an enemy, and truth is a menace.
[02:08:33.010 --> 02:08:36.010]  This is Mr. Romney Wordsworth.
[02:08:36.010 --> 02:08:38.010]  In his last 48 hours on Earth,
[02:08:38.010 --> 02:08:40.010]  he's a citizen of the state,
[02:08:40.010 --> 02:08:42.010]  but will soon have to be eliminated,
[02:08:42.010 --> 02:08:45.010]  because he is built out of flesh,
[02:08:45.010 --> 02:08:47.010]  and because he has a mind.
[02:08:47.010 --> 02:08:49.010]  Mr. Romney Wordsworth,
[02:08:49.010 --> 02:08:53.010]  who will draw his last breaths in the Twilight Zone.
[02:08:59.010 --> 02:09:03.010]  So what is it like for Mark Moreno,
[02:09:03.010 --> 02:09:05.010]  decades fighting this?
[02:09:05.010 --> 02:09:07.010]  I mean, I've been following him since I got on Earth,
[02:09:07.010 --> 02:09:08.010]  29 years ago.
[02:09:08.010 --> 02:09:10.010]  I've been interviewing him for 25 years.
[02:09:10.010 --> 02:09:11.010]  What is it like?
[02:09:11.010 --> 02:09:15.010]  I'm smoking a cigarette in ode to Rod Serling.
[02:09:15.010 --> 02:09:16.010]  What would he think today
[02:09:16.010 --> 02:09:20.010]  in World War II combat vet special forces
[02:09:20.010 --> 02:09:22.010]  going into Germany?
[02:09:22.010 --> 02:09:25.010]  What would he think about the world today?
[02:09:25.010 --> 02:09:28.010]  Because truth is an enemy,
[02:09:28.010 --> 02:09:30.010]  and logic is to be destroyed.
[02:09:30.010 --> 02:09:32.010]  I mean, that's really where we are.
[02:09:32.010 --> 02:09:34.010]  But the 35,000-foot view,
[02:09:34.010 --> 02:09:37.010]  I think we're not being caught flat-footed, Mark Moreno,
[02:09:37.010 --> 02:09:41.010]  in the time we have left, about 21 minutes.
[02:09:41.010 --> 02:09:43.010]  I see humanity waking up, but then I get concerned.
[02:09:43.010 --> 02:09:47.010]  What will the enemies of freedom do to counter that?
[02:09:49.010 --> 02:09:50.010]  Well, that's a great question,
[02:09:50.010 --> 02:09:52.010]  and I think what they're doing,
[02:09:52.010 --> 02:09:55.010]  we're watching it right now in real time.
[02:09:55.010 --> 02:09:57.010]  Last year, Joe Biden had the executive order
[02:09:57.010 --> 02:10:00.010]  for a central bank digital currency,
[02:10:00.010 --> 02:10:03.010]  and the Bank of England said the quiet part out loud
[02:10:03.010 --> 02:10:05.010]  in a UK Telegraph article.
[02:10:05.010 --> 02:10:06.010]  They said it's going to be,
[02:10:06.010 --> 02:10:09.010]  a central bank digital currency is essentially
[02:10:09.010 --> 02:10:10.010]  a way for government,
[02:10:10.010 --> 02:10:11.010]  you can only spend money
[02:10:11.010 --> 02:10:13.010]  on what the government deems sensible.
[02:10:13.010 --> 02:10:17.010]  So guns, ammo, meat, gas, energy,
[02:10:17.010 --> 02:10:19.010]  cigars, cigarettes, whatever,
[02:10:19.010 --> 02:10:21.010]  they may not deem that sensible.
[02:10:21.010 --> 02:10:22.010]  They will have total control.
[02:10:22.010 --> 02:10:26.010]  I think the pushback is going to be severe
[02:10:26.010 --> 02:10:28.010]  when more and more people wake up.
[02:10:28.010 --> 02:10:31.010]  We no longer need concentration camps,
[02:10:31.010 --> 02:10:34.010]  barbed wire fences, watchtowers with guards.
[02:10:34.010 --> 02:10:36.010]  They're going to have the ability,
[02:10:36.010 --> 02:10:37.010]  and have the ability now.
[02:10:37.010 --> 02:10:40.010]  Ford just got a patent to shut down your vehicle
[02:10:40.010 --> 02:10:43.010]  remotely if you miss a car payment.
[02:10:43.010 --> 02:10:44.010]  And you have,
[02:10:44.010 --> 02:10:47.010]  Elon Musk was being urged to shut down
[02:10:47.010 --> 02:10:49.010]  all the Teslas remotely for Russian citizens
[02:10:49.010 --> 02:10:52.010]  after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
[02:10:52.010 --> 02:10:55.010]  That's the kind of technology that they love
[02:10:55.010 --> 02:10:56.010]  and that they will pursue.
[02:10:56.010 --> 02:10:59.010]  The idea of MasterCard teaming up
[02:10:59.010 --> 02:11:00.010]  with the United Nations
[02:11:00.010 --> 02:11:02.010]  to monitor your carbon footprint.
[02:11:02.010 --> 02:11:04.010]  The idea of the World Health Organization's
[02:11:04.010 --> 02:11:05.010]  pandemic treaty,
[02:11:05.010 --> 02:11:07.010]  which Joe Biden is pushing us into,
[02:11:07.010 --> 02:11:09.010]  makes Bill Gates funded scientists
[02:11:09.010 --> 02:11:10.010]  be able to-
[02:11:10.010 --> 02:11:11.010]  I meant to erase that.
[02:11:11.010 --> 02:11:13.010]  His COVID chief is the one running it.
[02:11:13.010 --> 02:11:15.010]  Talk about that treaty.
[02:11:15.010 --> 02:11:17.010]  Yeah, this is where Bill Gates funded scientists
[02:11:17.010 --> 02:11:20.010]  can literally issue a global instant lockdown,
[02:11:20.010 --> 02:11:23.010]  stay at home orders, vaccine and mask mandates.
[02:11:23.010 --> 02:11:26.010]  The goal of this is to crush dissenters.
[02:11:26.010 --> 02:11:28.010]  They don't want ever to have another
[02:11:28.010 --> 02:11:30.010]  Ron DeSantis in Florida.
[02:11:30.010 --> 02:11:32.010]  They don't want ever to have a Sweden.
[02:11:32.010 --> 02:11:33.010]  Why?
[02:11:33.010 --> 02:11:35.010]  Because they show you the big lie.
[02:11:35.010 --> 02:11:38.010]  They show you the lie that lockdowns were necessary,
[02:11:38.010 --> 02:11:40.010]  mask mandates or vaccine mandates were necessary
[02:11:40.010 --> 02:11:43.010]  because all of these places did better
[02:11:43.010 --> 02:11:44.010]  that buck this.
[02:11:44.010 --> 02:11:47.010]  And so the idea here now is to get uniformity,
[02:11:47.010 --> 02:11:48.010]  no dissent allowed.
[02:11:48.010 --> 02:11:50.010]  Just like in climate, just now-
[02:11:50.010 --> 02:11:52.010]  Did you see the latest WF announcement
[02:11:52.010 --> 02:11:55.010]  that COVID failed to bring in world government,
[02:11:55.010 --> 02:11:56.010]  climate change is failing,
[02:11:56.010 --> 02:11:58.010]  next is water crisis.
[02:11:58.010 --> 02:12:00.010]  I did see that about the water crisis.
[02:12:00.010 --> 02:12:02.010]  They're trying everything that'll throw it.
[02:12:02.010 --> 02:12:03.010]  Now here's the thing though.
[02:12:03.010 --> 02:12:05.010]  What they're really going to do here,
[02:12:05.010 --> 02:12:06.010]  and I think the next step is,
[02:12:06.010 --> 02:12:08.010]  is the merging of COVID,
[02:12:08.010 --> 02:12:10.010]  sorry, climate in the public health bureaucracy.
[02:12:10.010 --> 02:12:12.010]  World health organizations already said
[02:12:12.010 --> 02:12:13.010]  climate is the greatest public health threat
[02:12:13.010 --> 02:12:15.010]  of the 21st century.
[02:12:15.010 --> 02:12:16.010]  The Harvard School of Medicine,
[02:12:16.010 --> 02:12:18.010]  funded by the Chinese or Chinese interest,
[02:12:18.010 --> 02:12:21.010]  has now said unchecked climate change
[02:12:21.010 --> 02:12:23.010]  leads to more COVID-like viruses.
[02:12:23.010 --> 02:12:25.010]  That's just like Saudi Arabia funds
[02:12:25.010 --> 02:12:26.010]  90% of anti-fracking here.
[02:12:26.010 --> 02:12:27.010]  It's very simple.
[02:12:27.010 --> 02:12:28.010]  That's right.
[02:12:28.010 --> 02:12:29.010]  Yes, they do all that.
[02:12:29.010 --> 02:12:30.010]  Yes.
[02:12:30.010 --> 02:12:32.010]  And so if you oppose the Green New Deal,
[02:12:32.010 --> 02:12:34.010]  you are now a grandma killer
[02:12:34.010 --> 02:12:36.010]  because you'll cause more viruses.
[02:12:36.010 --> 02:12:37.010]  What we know now,
[02:12:37.010 --> 02:12:38.010]  the Journal of Nature,
[02:12:38.010 --> 02:12:40.010]  Anthony Fauci on multiple occasions,
[02:12:40.010 --> 02:12:42.010]  it didn't come from a lab in China.
[02:12:42.010 --> 02:12:43.010]  It's due to climate change.
[02:12:43.010 --> 02:12:45.010]  This is what they're pushing.
[02:12:45.010 --> 02:12:47.010]  So because of all of this,
[02:12:47.010 --> 02:12:49.010]  they have so much power at the moment.
[02:12:49.010 --> 02:12:51.010]  They're taking away our freedom of movement.
[02:12:51.010 --> 02:12:52.010]  Again, these are all-
[02:12:52.010 --> 02:12:53.010]  That's right.
[02:12:53.010 --> 02:12:56.010]  While they administratively turn off the power,
[02:12:56.010 --> 02:12:57.010]  the energy, lock down third world,
[02:12:57.010 --> 02:12:59.010]  then flood us with third world,
[02:12:59.010 --> 02:13:01.010]  they blame it on climate change.
[02:13:01.010 --> 02:13:03.010]  Yes, they just had a UN meeting in South Africa
[02:13:03.010 --> 02:13:05.010]  pushing a global carbon tax.
[02:13:05.010 --> 02:13:07.010]  I'm going in three weeks,
[02:13:07.010 --> 02:13:08.010]  I guess not three weeks,
[02:13:08.010 --> 02:13:09.010]  two months,
[02:13:09.010 --> 02:13:10.010]  I'm going to Dubai,
[02:13:10.010 --> 02:13:11.010]  United Arab Emirates
[02:13:11.010 --> 02:13:13.010]  to the next United Nations Climate Summit.
[02:13:13.010 --> 02:13:15.010]  I was at the last one in Egypt, Alex,
[02:13:15.010 --> 02:13:17.010]  and the World Economic Forum was there,
[02:13:17.010 --> 02:13:18.010]  Bill Gates was there,
[02:13:18.010 --> 02:13:21.010]  and Al Gore was there,
[02:13:21.010 --> 02:13:22.010]  did a partnership with Google.
[02:13:22.010 --> 02:13:24.010]  Big Al is watching you.
[02:13:24.010 --> 02:13:26.010]  Al Gore and Google are going to have satellites
[02:13:26.010 --> 02:13:27.010]  all over the world,
[02:13:27.010 --> 02:13:28.010]  tens of thousands-
[02:13:28.010 --> 02:13:29.010]  Well, that's the whole point is
[02:13:29.010 --> 02:13:31.010]  total surveillance of carbon,
[02:13:31.010 --> 02:13:32.010]  internet of things,
[02:13:32.010 --> 02:13:33.010]  social credit scores.
[02:13:33.010 --> 02:13:34.010]  So let me ask the question again,
[02:13:34.010 --> 02:13:35.010]  and then you'll have the floor.
[02:13:35.010 --> 02:13:37.010]  What's the 35,000 foot view?
[02:13:37.010 --> 02:13:38.010]  How is it going for them?
[02:13:38.010 --> 02:13:39.010]  Yeah.
[02:13:39.010 --> 02:13:41.010]  Well, I think a couple-
[02:13:41.010 --> 02:13:42.010]  I mean,
[02:13:42.010 --> 02:13:44.010]  there's a lot of problems for them right now.
[02:13:44.010 --> 02:13:45.010]  You have Larry Fink saying
[02:13:45.010 --> 02:13:46.010]  he doesn't like the term ESG,
[02:13:46.010 --> 02:13:47.010]  he doesn't want to use it.
[02:13:47.010 --> 02:13:49.010]  You have the World Economic Forum,
[02:13:49.010 --> 02:13:51.010]  and you got to credit the Rebel News,
[02:13:51.010 --> 02:13:52.010]  Ezra Levine,
[02:13:52.010 --> 02:13:53.010]  who I was just on his show yesterday,
[02:13:53.010 --> 02:13:56.010]  for going to the town in Davos
[02:13:56.010 --> 02:13:58.010]  with his team at Rebel News,
[02:13:58.010 --> 02:14:00.010]  and they literally humiliated
[02:14:00.010 --> 02:14:01.010]  the World Economic Forum bigwigs
[02:14:01.010 --> 02:14:04.010]  from Albert Bourla to Greta Thunberg
[02:14:04.010 --> 02:14:05.010]  to John Kerry.
[02:14:05.010 --> 02:14:07.010]  They confronted them in the streets.
[02:14:07.010 --> 02:14:08.010]  Believe me,
[02:14:08.010 --> 02:14:09.010]  the next Davos meeting,
[02:14:09.010 --> 02:14:10.010]  they won't allow it.
[02:14:10.010 --> 02:14:12.010]  So their agenda has become toxic.
[02:14:12.010 --> 02:14:13.010]  They now know
[02:14:13.010 --> 02:14:15.010]  that with Republican governors
[02:14:15.010 --> 02:14:16.010]  and attorney generals pushing back.
[02:14:16.010 --> 02:14:18.010]  So I think what they're going to try to do
[02:14:18.010 --> 02:14:19.010]  is go more undercover
[02:14:19.010 --> 02:14:20.010]  with what they're doing.
[02:14:20.010 --> 02:14:21.010]  But remember,
[02:14:21.010 --> 02:14:23.010]  they already have this stranglehold.
[02:14:23.010 --> 02:14:25.010]  Our car bans are coming,
[02:14:25.010 --> 02:14:27.010]  our collapse of our medical system.
[02:14:27.010 --> 02:14:30.010]  All this is already well in play,
[02:14:30.010 --> 02:14:32.010]  and you have leadership like Republican.
[02:14:32.010 --> 02:14:33.010]  Let's talk about just one moment
[02:14:33.010 --> 02:14:35.010]  about Kevin McCarthy.
[02:14:35.010 --> 02:14:36.010]  He literally,
[02:14:36.010 --> 02:14:37.010]  when asked about climate change,
[02:14:37.010 --> 02:14:38.010]  this is now the House speaker,
[02:14:38.010 --> 02:14:40.010]  not the 1950s actor,
[02:14:40.010 --> 02:14:41.010]  but he literally would say,
[02:14:41.010 --> 02:14:42.010]  climate's a problem,
[02:14:42.010 --> 02:14:43.010]  and we need solutions.
[02:14:43.010 --> 02:14:45.010]  Republicans believe in science.
[02:14:45.010 --> 02:14:46.010]  We need to plant trees
[02:14:46.010 --> 02:14:48.010]  and capture carbon.
[02:14:48.010 --> 02:14:49.010]  In other words,
[02:14:49.010 --> 02:14:50.010]  billions of dollars
[02:14:50.010 --> 02:14:51.010]  to Republican donors
[02:14:51.010 --> 02:14:52.010]  to do boondoggles.
[02:14:52.010 --> 02:14:53.010]  Republican leadership
[02:14:53.010 --> 02:14:54.010]  has never gotten this.
[02:14:54.010 --> 02:14:56.010]  I think what happened last night,
[02:14:56.010 --> 02:14:57.010]  despite what I've seen
[02:14:57.010 --> 02:14:59.010]  a lot of the commentary on Fox News,
[02:14:59.010 --> 02:15:01.010]  just having eight Republicans
[02:15:01.010 --> 02:15:03.010]  wield that kind of power
[02:15:03.010 --> 02:15:05.010]  should inspire anyone
[02:15:05.010 --> 02:15:06.010]  who's excited about
[02:15:06.010 --> 02:15:07.010]  fighting the forces
[02:15:07.010 --> 02:15:08.010]  of the Great Recession.
[02:15:08.010 --> 02:15:09.010]  I was about to say,
[02:15:09.010 --> 02:15:10.010]  I think this is super healthy,
[02:15:10.010 --> 02:15:12.010]  what Matt Gaetz did.
[02:15:12.010 --> 02:15:13.010]  It's the greatest thing
[02:15:13.010 --> 02:15:15.010]  I've ever seen.
[02:15:15.010 --> 02:15:16.010]  It only matters
[02:15:16.010 --> 02:15:17.010]  if you think the Republican Party
[02:15:17.010 --> 02:15:18.010]  is the greatest thing
[02:15:18.010 --> 02:15:19.010]  since sliced bread
[02:15:19.010 --> 02:15:21.010]  and, oh, it's team Republican.
[02:15:21.010 --> 02:15:22.010]  No.
[02:15:22.010 --> 02:15:23.010]  This was a massive check
[02:15:23.010 --> 02:15:25.010]  to power by just eight people.
[02:15:25.010 --> 02:15:27.010]  Just like the school board level,
[02:15:27.010 --> 02:15:28.010]  angry parents
[02:15:28.010 --> 02:15:30.010]  were a massive check to power
[02:15:30.010 --> 02:15:31.010]  against the COVID agenda.
[02:15:31.010 --> 02:15:32.010]  Exactly.
[02:15:32.010 --> 02:15:33.010]  Think how weak they are
[02:15:33.010 --> 02:15:34.010]  that they sick
[02:15:34.010 --> 02:15:35.010]  the Justice Department on them.
[02:15:35.010 --> 02:15:36.010]  They are so scared
[02:15:36.010 --> 02:15:37.010]  of us standing up.
[02:15:37.010 --> 02:15:38.010]  So I think
[02:15:38.010 --> 02:15:40.010]  they're going to double down here.
[02:15:40.010 --> 02:15:41.010]  What's going to happen
[02:15:41.010 --> 02:15:42.010]  in terms of the ruling class,
[02:15:42.010 --> 02:15:44.010]  this whole Great Reset agenda,
[02:15:44.010 --> 02:15:45.010]  it's already accelerating
[02:15:45.010 --> 02:15:46.010]  in many ways.
[02:15:46.010 --> 02:15:47.010]  They're pushing
[02:15:47.010 --> 02:15:48.010]  the equity asset
[02:15:48.010 --> 02:15:49.010]  buying up of property.
[02:15:49.010 --> 02:15:50.010]  Carol Roth,
[02:15:50.010 --> 02:15:51.010]  who wrote the book
[02:15:51.010 --> 02:15:52.010]  You'll Own Nothing,
[02:15:52.010 --> 02:15:53.010]  give me a plug in another book.
[02:15:53.010 --> 02:15:55.010]  She talks about 2010
[02:15:55.010 --> 02:15:56.010]  barely on the radar
[02:15:56.010 --> 02:15:57.010]  for equity asset firms
[02:15:57.010 --> 02:15:58.010]  buying up
[02:15:58.010 --> 02:16:00.010]  residential real estate.
[02:16:00.010 --> 02:16:01.010]  Fast forward to today,
[02:16:01.010 --> 02:16:02.010]  I think it's more than 25%
[02:16:02.010 --> 02:16:03.010]  of every,
[02:16:03.010 --> 02:16:04.010]  one out of every
[02:16:04.010 --> 02:16:05.010]  four or five transactions
[02:16:05.010 --> 02:16:07.010]  is now an equity asset firm.
[02:16:07.010 --> 02:16:08.010]  And some of the most
[02:16:08.010 --> 02:16:09.010]  sought after neighborhoods
[02:16:09.010 --> 02:16:10.010]  driving up this price,
[02:16:10.010 --> 02:16:11.010]  they want to make
[02:16:11.010 --> 02:16:12.010]  an incredible mortgage fraud
[02:16:12.010 --> 02:16:13.010]  by them just taking
[02:16:13.010 --> 02:16:14.010]  people's houses.
[02:16:14.010 --> 02:16:15.010]  Yes.
[02:16:15.010 --> 02:16:16.010]  Absolutely.
[02:16:16.010 --> 02:16:17.010]  And so,
[02:16:17.010 --> 02:16:18.010]  what I think
[02:16:18.010 --> 02:16:19.010]  what's going to end up
[02:16:19.010 --> 02:16:20.010]  happening here
[02:16:20.010 --> 02:16:21.010]  is the biggest thing we need
[02:16:21.010 --> 02:16:22.010]  right now,
[02:16:22.010 --> 02:16:23.010]  here's the scary part.
[02:16:23.010 --> 02:16:24.010]  And this is where I think
[02:16:24.010 --> 02:16:25.010]  they get desperate.
[02:16:25.010 --> 02:16:26.010]  NBC News did a segment
[02:16:26.010 --> 02:16:27.010]  about a month ago, Alex,
[02:16:27.010 --> 02:16:28.010]  where they said
[02:16:28.010 --> 02:16:30.010]  Joe Biden may declare
[02:16:30.010 --> 02:16:32.010]  this national climate emergency.
[02:16:32.010 --> 02:16:33.010]  Now, we already know
[02:16:33.010 --> 02:16:34.010]  the Center for Biological Diversity
[02:16:34.010 --> 02:16:35.010]  says it will give him
[02:16:35.010 --> 02:16:37.010]  130 new executive powers.
[02:16:37.010 --> 02:16:39.010]  NBC News took it further
[02:16:39.010 --> 02:16:40.010]  and literally said
[02:16:40.010 --> 02:16:41.010]  it would give him powers
[02:16:41.010 --> 02:16:43.010]  similar to the COVID
[02:16:43.010 --> 02:16:44.010]  emergency declaration
[02:16:44.010 --> 02:16:46.010]  and similar to the 9-11.
[02:16:46.010 --> 02:16:48.010]  And the WF said two years ago,
[02:16:48.010 --> 02:16:49.010]  and Project Veritas got it,
[02:16:49.010 --> 02:16:51.010]  that the climate emergency
[02:16:51.010 --> 02:16:52.010]  was the next move.
[02:16:52.010 --> 02:16:53.010]  Yes.
[02:16:53.010 --> 02:16:54.010]  That's where the
[02:16:54.010 --> 02:16:55.010]  CNN technical director,
[02:16:55.010 --> 02:16:56.010]  Charlie,
[02:16:56.010 --> 02:16:57.010]  I can't remember his last name,
[02:16:57.010 --> 02:16:58.010]  but yes,
[02:16:58.010 --> 02:16:59.010]  that's where they
[02:16:59.010 --> 02:17:00.010]  admitted that on camera.
[02:17:00.010 --> 02:17:01.010]  But here's the thing.
[02:17:01.010 --> 02:17:02.010]  So,
[02:17:02.010 --> 02:17:04.010]  when you're faced with pushback
[02:17:04.010 --> 02:17:05.010]  from the public,
[02:17:05.010 --> 02:17:06.010]  what do you do?
[02:17:06.010 --> 02:17:08.010]  You declare more emergency powers.
[02:17:08.010 --> 02:17:09.010]  And I think that's what
[02:17:09.010 --> 02:17:10.010]  I'm afraid of.
[02:17:10.010 --> 02:17:11.010]  Just like we just saw
[02:17:11.010 --> 02:17:12.010]  in New Mexico,
[02:17:12.010 --> 02:17:13.010]  but we need to counter it.
[02:17:13.010 --> 02:17:14.010]  Yes.
[02:17:14.010 --> 02:17:15.010]  And not only what happened
[02:17:15.010 --> 02:17:16.010]  in New Mexico,
[02:17:16.010 --> 02:17:17.010]  New Mexico was going after
[02:17:17.010 --> 02:17:18.010]  gun violence,
[02:17:18.010 --> 02:17:19.010]  public health threat.
[02:17:19.010 --> 02:17:20.010]  We've heard misinformation
[02:17:20.010 --> 02:17:21.010]  as a public health threat.
[02:17:21.010 --> 02:17:22.010]  We've heard racism
[02:17:22.010 --> 02:17:23.010]  as a public health threat.
[02:17:23.010 --> 02:17:24.010]  We've heard climate
[02:17:24.010 --> 02:17:25.010]  as a public health threat.
[02:17:25.010 --> 02:17:26.010]  They're going to go
[02:17:26.010 --> 02:17:27.010]  after every possible avenue.
[02:17:27.010 --> 02:17:28.010]  Well,
[02:17:28.010 --> 02:17:29.010]  remember the CDC
[02:17:29.010 --> 02:17:30.010]  tried to forgive rents
[02:17:30.010 --> 02:17:31.010]  and the Supreme Court
[02:17:31.010 --> 02:17:32.010]  stopped them.
[02:17:32.010 --> 02:17:33.010]  Yes,
[02:17:33.010 --> 02:17:34.010]  that was under,
[02:17:34.010 --> 02:17:35.010]  yes.
[02:17:35.010 --> 02:17:36.010]  And again,
[02:17:36.010 --> 02:17:37.010]  and that whole thing
[02:17:37.010 --> 02:17:38.010]  with the rents,
[02:17:38.010 --> 02:17:39.010]  and then think of the mask mandates.
[02:17:39.010 --> 02:17:40.010]  It was almost two years
[02:17:40.010 --> 02:17:41.010]  before one Donald Trump
[02:17:41.010 --> 02:17:42.010]  federally appointed judge
[02:17:42.010 --> 02:17:43.010]  stopped that.
[02:17:43.010 --> 02:17:44.010]  And let me ask you this.
[02:17:44.010 --> 02:17:45.010]  What do you make
[02:17:45.010 --> 02:17:46.010]  from my whistleblowers
[02:17:46.010 --> 02:17:47.010]  two months ago?
[02:17:47.010 --> 02:17:48.010]  Now it's all confirmed.
[02:17:48.010 --> 02:17:49.010]  They're trying the new rollout
[02:17:49.010 --> 02:17:50.010]  of COVID lockdowns.
[02:17:50.010 --> 02:17:51.010]  It's not working,
[02:17:51.010 --> 02:17:52.010]  but they're still doing it.
[02:17:52.010 --> 02:17:53.010]  I just,
[02:17:53.010 --> 02:17:54.010]  we're getting reports,
[02:17:54.010 --> 02:17:55.010]  even people who work
[02:17:55.010 --> 02:17:56.010]  in public health
[02:17:56.010 --> 02:17:57.010]  and state governments,
[02:17:57.010 --> 02:17:58.010]  Oregon,
[02:17:58.010 --> 02:17:59.010]  if you even test positive
[02:17:59.010 --> 02:18:00.010]  for COVID now,
[02:18:00.010 --> 02:18:01.010]  you got to mask up
[02:18:01.010 --> 02:18:02.010]  for a week at your job.
[02:18:02.010 --> 02:18:03.010]  This is not going away.
[02:18:03.010 --> 02:18:04.010]  We're only in October.
[02:18:04.010 --> 02:18:05.010]  So wait until the height
[02:18:05.010 --> 02:18:06.010]  of the flu season
[02:18:06.010 --> 02:18:07.010]  comes December,
[02:18:07.010 --> 02:18:08.010]  January.
[02:18:08.010 --> 02:18:09.010]  They may try to cancel
[02:18:09.010 --> 02:18:10.010]  Christmas again.
[02:18:10.010 --> 02:18:11.010]  They're desperate here.
[02:18:11.010 --> 02:18:12.010]  And that's what I'm trying
[02:18:12.010 --> 02:18:13.010]  to tell you.
[02:18:13.010 --> 02:18:14.010]  This climate emergency
[02:18:14.010 --> 02:18:15.010]  declaration,
[02:18:15.010 --> 02:18:16.010]  Joe Biden's a lame duck.
[02:18:16.010 --> 02:18:17.010]  I can't imagine
[02:18:17.010 --> 02:18:18.010]  why he wouldn't do it.
[02:18:18.010 --> 02:18:19.010]  You have the Weather Channel
[02:18:19.010 --> 02:18:20.010]  pushing him,
[02:18:20.010 --> 02:18:21.010]  AOC,
[02:18:21.010 --> 02:18:23.010]  it's October 4th.
[02:18:23.010 --> 02:18:24.010]  The big emergency alert.
[02:18:24.010 --> 02:18:25.010]  Look at my beautiful
[02:18:25.010 --> 02:18:26.010]  six-year-old daughter.
[02:18:26.010 --> 02:18:28.010]  It is right now.
[02:18:28.010 --> 02:18:31.010]  It's a 30-minute alert takeover
[02:18:31.010 --> 02:18:33.010]  practicing total control.
[02:18:33.010 --> 02:18:34.010]  What do you make of that?
[02:18:34.010 --> 02:18:36.010]  It says overhead shot, guys.
[02:18:36.010 --> 02:18:37.010]  National alert,
[02:18:37.010 --> 02:18:38.010]  overhead shot, guys.
[02:18:38.010 --> 02:18:39.010]  This is a test
[02:18:39.010 --> 02:18:40.010]  of the National Wireless
[02:18:40.010 --> 02:18:42.010]  Emergency Alert System.
[02:18:42.010 --> 02:18:44.010]  The purpose is to
[02:18:44.010 --> 02:18:46.010]  maintain and improve
[02:18:46.010 --> 02:18:48.010]  warning capabilities
[02:18:48.010 --> 02:18:49.010]  of the federal,
[02:18:49.010 --> 02:18:50.010]  state,
[02:18:50.010 --> 02:18:52.010]  and local governments
[02:18:52.010 --> 02:18:54.010]  and territorial levels
[02:18:54.010 --> 02:18:56.010]  and to evaluate
[02:18:56.010 --> 02:18:58.010]  the nation's public
[02:18:58.010 --> 02:19:00.010]  and warning capabilities.
[02:19:00.010 --> 02:19:02.010]  No action is requested
[02:19:02.010 --> 02:19:03.010]  by the public.
[02:19:03.010 --> 02:19:04.010]  Wow.
[02:19:04.010 --> 02:19:06.010]  So what do you make of that?
[02:19:06.010 --> 02:19:08.010]  I have not gotten mine yet.
[02:19:08.010 --> 02:19:09.010]  And I'm on Android.
[02:19:09.010 --> 02:19:10.010]  I don't wonder why.
[02:19:10.010 --> 02:19:11.010]  I don't know what's going on.
[02:19:11.010 --> 02:19:12.010]  But is it quite 220 yet?
[02:19:12.010 --> 02:19:13.010]  I haven't gotten it.
[02:19:13.010 --> 02:19:14.010]  But this is just another,
[02:19:14.010 --> 02:19:16.010]  you remember COVID theater?
[02:19:16.010 --> 02:19:17.010]  This is some kind of
[02:19:17.010 --> 02:19:18.010]  emergency alert theater,
[02:19:18.010 --> 02:19:20.010]  basically letting you know
[02:19:20.010 --> 02:19:21.010]  the government can reach you
[02:19:21.010 --> 02:19:23.010]  wherever you are
[02:19:23.010 --> 02:19:24.010]  through the latest
[02:19:24.010 --> 02:19:25.010]  communication device.
[02:19:25.010 --> 02:19:26.010]  It's a practice of the takeover.
[02:19:26.010 --> 02:19:27.010]  It's the Internet kills
[02:19:27.010 --> 02:19:28.010]  what Obama put out.
[02:19:28.010 --> 02:19:29.010]  And the idea is
[02:19:29.010 --> 02:19:30.010]  we're all in this together.
[02:19:30.010 --> 02:19:31.010]  You listen to this.
[02:19:31.010 --> 02:19:32.010]  It reminds me of
[02:19:32.010 --> 02:19:34.010]  New Zealand Prime Minister
[02:19:34.010 --> 02:19:35.010]  Jacinta Ardern.
[02:19:35.010 --> 02:19:36.010]  Don't listen to anybody.
[02:19:36.010 --> 02:19:39.010]  Guys, pull up New Zealand.
[02:19:39.010 --> 02:19:40.010]  New Zealand Prime Minister.
[02:19:40.010 --> 02:19:41.010]  Only listen to us.
[02:19:41.010 --> 02:19:42.010]  Go ahead.
[02:19:42.010 --> 02:19:43.010]  Yes.
[02:19:43.010 --> 02:19:44.010]  You have that on cue?
[02:19:44.010 --> 02:19:45.010]  That's great.
[02:19:45.010 --> 02:19:46.010]  We're going to find it.
[02:19:46.010 --> 02:19:47.010]  They're finding it.
[02:19:47.010 --> 02:19:48.010]  She also said
[02:19:48.010 --> 02:19:49.010]  don't look at the sunset.
[02:19:50.010 --> 02:19:51.010]  Yeah.
[02:19:51.010 --> 02:19:52.010]  Don't talk to your neighbors.
[02:19:52.010 --> 02:19:53.010]  Don't go out.
[02:19:53.010 --> 02:19:54.010]  Her famous word was
[02:19:54.010 --> 02:19:56.010]  stay in your bubble.
[02:19:56.010 --> 02:19:57.010]  I remember that
[02:19:57.010 --> 02:19:58.010]  because that's what they want
[02:19:58.010 --> 02:19:59.010]  with these 15-minute cities.
[02:19:59.010 --> 02:20:00.010]  You're going to be locked in.
[02:20:00.010 --> 02:20:01.010]  Oxford's doing it.
[02:20:01.010 --> 02:20:02.010]  The idea,
[02:20:02.010 --> 02:20:03.010]  you can only leave
[02:20:03.010 --> 02:20:05.010]  like 90, 95 times a year
[02:20:05.010 --> 02:20:06.010]  before they start fighting you
[02:20:06.010 --> 02:20:07.010]  and restricting you
[02:20:07.010 --> 02:20:08.010]  because you've got to stay.
[02:20:08.010 --> 02:20:09.010]  This is your utopia.
[02:20:09.010 --> 02:20:10.010]  A major Australian city
[02:20:10.010 --> 02:20:12.010]  just announced 15-minute cities.
[02:20:13.010 --> 02:20:14.010]  Yeah.
[02:20:14.010 --> 02:20:15.010]  This is spreading as well too.
[02:20:15.010 --> 02:20:16.010]  We've got nine minutes left.
[02:20:16.010 --> 02:20:17.010]  You're riveting.
[02:20:17.010 --> 02:20:18.010]  I keep interrupting.
[02:20:18.010 --> 02:20:19.010]  You've got the floor.
[02:20:19.010 --> 02:20:20.010]  Go.
[02:20:20.010 --> 02:20:21.010]  Okay.
[02:20:21.010 --> 02:20:22.010]  But what Jacinda Ardeen said,
[02:20:22.010 --> 02:20:23.010]  literally,
[02:20:23.010 --> 02:20:25.010]  we will be your sole source of truth.
[02:20:25.010 --> 02:20:26.010]  That's what the idea
[02:20:26.010 --> 02:20:27.010]  of this government is.
[02:20:27.010 --> 02:20:29.010]  That is a whole other aspect of this.
[02:20:29.010 --> 02:20:30.010]  They're also collapsing
[02:20:30.010 --> 02:20:31.010]  our financial system,
[02:20:31.010 --> 02:20:33.010]  modern monetary theory,
[02:20:33.010 --> 02:20:34.010]  printing of money,
[02:20:34.010 --> 02:20:35.010]  inflation.
[02:20:35.010 --> 02:20:36.010]  That goes perfectly
[02:20:36.010 --> 02:20:37.010]  hand-in-hand
[02:20:37.010 --> 02:20:38.010]  with the central bank
[02:20:38.010 --> 02:20:39.010]  digital currency.
[02:20:39.010 --> 02:20:40.010]  I think the whole
[02:20:40.010 --> 02:20:41.010]  Sam Bankman freed
[02:20:41.010 --> 02:20:42.010]  was the idea of trying
[02:20:42.010 --> 02:20:43.010]  to scare people away
[02:20:43.010 --> 02:20:45.010]  from decentralized cryptocurrency,
[02:20:45.010 --> 02:20:46.010]  which is competing
[02:20:46.010 --> 02:20:47.010]  with the opposite
[02:20:47.010 --> 02:20:48.010]  of the central bank
[02:20:48.010 --> 02:20:49.010]  digital currency.
[02:20:49.010 --> 02:20:50.010]  So there have
[02:20:50.010 --> 02:20:51.010]  so many organs.
[02:20:51.010 --> 02:20:52.010]  And then you have people
[02:20:52.010 --> 02:20:53.010]  like Dan Crenshaw,
[02:20:53.010 --> 02:20:54.010]  Republican leadership
[02:20:54.010 --> 02:20:55.010]  who think
[02:20:55.010 --> 02:20:56.010]  World Economic Forum,
[02:20:56.010 --> 02:20:57.010]  they're not anything.
[02:20:57.010 --> 02:20:58.010]  That's not anything
[02:20:58.010 --> 02:20:59.010]  to worry about.
[02:20:59.010 --> 02:21:00.010]  That's not,
[02:21:00.010 --> 02:21:01.010]  you know,
[02:21:01.010 --> 02:21:02.010]  that's a conspiracy theory.
[02:21:02.010 --> 02:21:03.010]  So many of our top
[02:21:03.010 --> 02:21:04.010]  Republican leaders
[02:21:04.010 --> 02:21:05.010]  who should know better
[02:21:05.010 --> 02:21:06.010]  are completely clueless.
[02:21:06.010 --> 02:21:07.010]  In fact,
[02:21:07.010 --> 02:21:08.010]  the only ones I think
[02:21:08.010 --> 02:21:09.010]  really get it,
[02:21:09.010 --> 02:21:10.010]  and I give Donald Trump credit,
[02:21:10.010 --> 02:21:11.010]  he went to the
[02:21:11.010 --> 02:21:12.010]  World Economic Forum,
[02:21:12.010 --> 02:21:13.010]  I believe it was 2017,
[02:21:13.010 --> 02:21:14.010]  and he literally compared
[02:21:14.010 --> 02:21:15.010]  the climate agenda
[02:21:15.010 --> 02:21:16.010]  to the palm readers
[02:21:16.010 --> 02:21:18.010]  and tarot card readers
[02:21:18.010 --> 02:21:19.010]  of the boardwalk.
[02:21:19.010 --> 02:21:20.010]  And that's the way you go.
[02:21:20.010 --> 02:21:21.010]  If you're going to go
[02:21:21.010 --> 02:21:22.010]  to one of these meetings,
[02:21:22.010 --> 02:21:24.010]  go there to use their platform
[02:21:24.010 --> 02:21:25.010]  to condemn them.
[02:21:25.010 --> 02:21:26.010]  I haven't seen that done
[02:21:26.010 --> 02:21:28.010]  before or since
[02:21:28.010 --> 02:21:30.010]  at a World Economic Forum meeting.
[02:21:30.010 --> 02:21:32.010]  But I think if you look
[02:21:32.010 --> 02:21:33.010]  at this whole agenda
[02:21:33.010 --> 02:21:34.010]  as it's playing out right now,
[02:21:34.010 --> 02:21:36.010]  we now have the calls
[02:21:36.010 --> 02:21:37.010]  to add climate change
[02:21:37.010 --> 02:21:38.010]  to the death certificate
[02:21:38.010 --> 02:21:39.010]  as a cause of death.
[02:21:39.010 --> 02:21:40.010]  We have doctors in Canada
[02:21:40.010 --> 02:21:42.010]  did the first medically
[02:21:43.010 --> 02:21:44.010]  in medical history
[02:21:44.010 --> 02:21:45.010]  diagnosed a patient
[02:21:45.010 --> 02:21:47.010]  as suffering from climate change.
[02:21:47.010 --> 02:21:49.010]  You have the Harvard
[02:21:49.010 --> 02:21:50.010]  Environmental Law Review
[02:21:50.010 --> 02:21:52.010]  now saying you can charge people
[02:21:52.010 --> 02:21:53.010]  with climate homicide.
[02:21:53.010 --> 02:21:55.010]  So you can commit climate homicide.
[02:21:55.010 --> 02:21:56.010]  You can be diagnosed
[02:21:56.010 --> 02:21:57.010]  with climate change.
[02:21:57.010 --> 02:21:58.010]  You can have it
[02:21:58.010 --> 02:22:00.010]  as a cause of your death certificate.
[02:22:00.010 --> 02:22:01.010]  And are you ready for this one?
[02:22:01.010 --> 02:22:03.010]  You may not even know this one, Alex.
[02:22:03.010 --> 02:22:04.010]  The Biden administration
[02:22:04.010 --> 02:22:05.010]  is now authoring
[02:22:05.010 --> 02:22:07.010]  the Health and Human Services division
[02:22:07.010 --> 02:22:08.010]  of the United States government
[02:22:08.010 --> 02:22:10.010]  to start naming heat waves
[02:22:11.010 --> 02:22:13.010]  and keeping death toll counts
[02:22:13.010 --> 02:22:14.010]  of heat waves
[02:22:14.010 --> 02:22:16.010]  as climate-related events.
[02:22:16.010 --> 02:22:17.010]  This goes exactly.
[02:22:17.010 --> 02:22:18.010]  It was Charlie Chester
[02:22:18.010 --> 02:22:19.010]  or something like that
[02:22:19.010 --> 02:22:21.010]  from CNN who told Project Veritas.
[02:22:21.010 --> 02:22:23.010]  We are not far now
[02:22:23.010 --> 02:22:25.010]  from the U.S. federal government
[02:22:25.010 --> 02:22:26.010]  through the Health
[02:22:26.010 --> 02:22:27.010]  and Human Services division
[02:22:27.010 --> 02:22:28.010]  keeping a daily,
[02:22:28.010 --> 02:22:30.010]  monthly, weekly climate death toll.
[02:22:30.010 --> 02:22:31.010]  You can already see
[02:22:31.010 --> 02:22:32.010]  the death tolls now
[02:22:32.010 --> 02:22:34.010]  on CNN, MSNBC.
[02:22:34.010 --> 02:22:35.010]  Do they die with climate
[02:22:35.010 --> 02:22:36.010]  or do they die
[02:22:36.010 --> 02:22:37.010]  because of climate change?
[02:22:37.010 --> 02:22:38.010]  That's right.
[02:22:38.010 --> 02:22:39.010]  Now when people die of myocarditis,
[02:22:39.010 --> 02:22:41.010]  they're saying it's climate change.
[02:22:41.010 --> 02:22:42.010]  What's that?
[02:22:42.010 --> 02:22:44.010]  When they die of myocarditis,
[02:22:44.010 --> 02:22:46.010]  they say it's climate change.
[02:22:46.010 --> 02:22:48.010]  That's right.
[02:22:48.010 --> 02:22:49.010]  That's what Anthony Fauci
[02:22:49.010 --> 02:22:50.010]  and others,
[02:22:50.010 --> 02:22:51.010]  they're trying to blame
[02:22:51.010 --> 02:22:52.010]  every medical malady now
[02:22:52.010 --> 02:22:54.010]  on climate change.
[02:22:54.010 --> 02:22:55.010]  And you just have,
[02:22:55.010 --> 02:22:57.010]  this has been going on for years.
[02:22:57.010 --> 02:22:59.010]  I mean, they're blaming prostitution.
[02:22:59.010 --> 02:23:01.010]  They blame vehicle car thefts.
[02:23:01.010 --> 02:23:02.010]  It's comical.
[02:23:02.010 --> 02:23:03.010]  And the worst part of it
[02:23:03.010 --> 02:23:04.010]  is the solutions.
[02:23:04.010 --> 02:23:05.010]  You already have them going
[02:23:05.010 --> 02:23:07.010]  after woods fired pizza ovens
[02:23:07.010 --> 02:23:08.010]  in New York.
[02:23:08.010 --> 02:23:09.010]  Biden administration
[02:23:09.010 --> 02:23:10.010]  just announced
[02:23:10.010 --> 02:23:11.010]  new ceiling fan restrictions.
[02:23:11.010 --> 02:23:12.010]  You have Mayor Bloomberg,
[02:23:12.010 --> 02:23:13.010]  the billionaire,
[02:23:13.010 --> 02:23:16.010]  the C40 City report
[02:23:16.010 --> 02:23:18.010]  saying three new items of clothing
[02:23:18.010 --> 02:23:20.010]  per person per year by 2030
[02:23:20.010 --> 02:23:21.010]  as a, quote,
[02:23:21.010 --> 02:23:23.010]  intervention consumption,
[02:23:23.010 --> 02:23:24.010]  whatever that is.
[02:23:24.010 --> 02:23:25.010]  And I remember covering that
[02:23:25.010 --> 02:23:26.010]  six months ago
[02:23:26.010 --> 02:23:27.010]  in the UN report.
[02:23:27.010 --> 02:23:28.010]  People didn't believe it.
[02:23:28.010 --> 02:23:29.010]  Since you mentioned it,
[02:23:29.010 --> 02:23:30.010]  here is the disgraced
[02:23:30.010 --> 02:23:31.010]  Jacinda Ardens of New Zealand,
[02:23:31.010 --> 02:23:34.010]  now a UN global censor controller
[02:23:34.010 --> 02:23:36.010]  to run censorship,
[02:23:36.010 --> 02:23:37.010]  saying what you said
[02:23:37.010 --> 02:23:39.010]  that she's your only source of info.
[02:23:39.010 --> 02:23:40.010]  Here it is.
[02:23:40.010 --> 02:23:42.010]  You get the most
[02:23:42.010 --> 02:23:44.010]  information daily.
[02:23:44.010 --> 02:23:45.010]  You can trust us
[02:23:45.010 --> 02:23:47.010]  as a source of that information.
[02:23:47.010 --> 02:23:48.010]  You can also trust
[02:23:48.010 --> 02:23:50.010]  the Director General of Health
[02:23:50.010 --> 02:23:52.010]  and the Ministry of Health.
[02:23:52.010 --> 02:23:53.010]  For that information,
[02:23:53.010 --> 02:23:55.010]  do feel free to visit at any time
[02:23:55.010 --> 02:23:58.010]  to clarify any rumor you may hear,
[02:23:58.010 --> 02:24:01.010]  covid19.govt.nz.
[02:24:01.010 --> 02:24:02.010]  Otherwise,
[02:24:02.010 --> 02:24:04.010]  dismiss anything else.
[02:24:04.010 --> 02:24:05.010]  We will continue to be
[02:24:05.010 --> 02:24:07.010]  your single source of truth.
[02:24:07.010 --> 02:24:09.010]  We will provide information frequently.
[02:24:09.010 --> 02:24:11.010]  We will share everything we can,
[02:24:11.010 --> 02:24:13.010]  everything you are,
[02:24:13.010 --> 02:24:14.010]  else you see,
[02:24:14.010 --> 02:24:16.010]  a grain of salt.
[02:24:16.010 --> 02:24:17.010]  And so I really ask you...
[02:24:17.010 --> 02:24:18.010]  We will continue to be
[02:24:18.010 --> 02:24:20.010]  your only source of information.
[02:24:20.010 --> 02:24:21.010]  Sounds like we're in a cult,
[02:24:21.010 --> 02:24:22.010]  Mark Moreno.
[02:24:22.010 --> 02:24:23.010]  It does.
[02:24:23.010 --> 02:24:24.010]  This is incredible.
[02:24:24.010 --> 02:24:26.010]  In 2023 America
[02:24:26.010 --> 02:24:28.010]  and in the once free Western world,
[02:24:28.010 --> 02:24:29.010]  we are told
[02:24:29.010 --> 02:24:31.010]  that if you have a position
[02:24:31.010 --> 02:24:32.010]  or information
[02:24:32.010 --> 02:24:33.010]  that counters
[02:24:33.010 --> 02:24:35.010]  any official government narrative,
[02:24:35.010 --> 02:24:37.010]  you are by de facto
[02:24:37.010 --> 02:24:38.010]  a misinformer,
[02:24:38.010 --> 02:24:39.010]  a disinformer,
[02:24:39.010 --> 02:24:41.010]  and telling an untruth.
[02:24:41.010 --> 02:24:42.010]  Even though we've been proven
[02:24:42.010 --> 02:24:43.010]  like 98% accurate.
[02:24:43.010 --> 02:24:45.010]  On every single issue.
[02:24:45.010 --> 02:24:46.010]  You only have to go through it.
[02:24:46.010 --> 02:24:48.010]  List a few of the things we said,
[02:24:48.010 --> 02:24:49.010]  you said three and a half years ago,
[02:24:49.010 --> 02:24:50.010]  I said,
[02:24:50.010 --> 02:24:52.010]  that's now been proven right.
[02:24:52.010 --> 02:24:53.010]  Everything from
[02:24:53.010 --> 02:24:54.010]  lockdowns don't work
[02:24:54.010 --> 02:24:55.010]  to masks don't work
[02:24:55.010 --> 02:24:56.010]  to ivermectin
[02:24:56.010 --> 02:24:57.010]  to all the other solutions
[02:24:57.010 --> 02:24:59.010]  to...
[02:24:59.010 --> 02:25:00.010]  I mean,
[02:25:00.010 --> 02:25:01.010]  I can't even...
[02:25:01.010 --> 02:25:02.010]  There was climate lockdowns
[02:25:02.010 --> 02:25:03.010]  that COVID emergency powers
[02:25:03.010 --> 02:25:04.010]  were being abused.
[02:25:04.010 --> 02:25:05.010]  That the border was broken.
[02:25:05.010 --> 02:25:06.010]  They denied that.
[02:25:06.010 --> 02:25:07.010]  Now they admit it.
[02:25:07.010 --> 02:25:08.010]  Yes.
[02:25:08.010 --> 02:25:09.010]  And you could go...
[02:25:09.010 --> 02:25:10.010]  It's unbelievable.
[02:25:10.010 --> 02:25:12.010]  The idea that...
[02:25:12.010 --> 02:25:13.010]  Or that the Russians
[02:25:13.010 --> 02:25:14.010]  were winning in Ukraine.
[02:25:14.010 --> 02:25:15.010]  They've been lying about that.
[02:25:15.010 --> 02:25:16.010]  Yes.
[02:25:16.010 --> 02:25:17.010]  They get caught.
[02:25:17.010 --> 02:25:18.010]  This is why you need
[02:25:18.010 --> 02:25:19.010]  the CIA
[02:25:19.010 --> 02:25:20.010]  and DIA,
[02:25:20.010 --> 02:25:21.010]  Defense Intelligence,
[02:25:21.010 --> 02:25:22.010]  working closely
[02:25:22.010 --> 02:25:23.010]  with the big tech
[02:25:23.010 --> 02:25:24.010]  to censor,
[02:25:24.010 --> 02:25:25.010]  working in big tech...
[02:25:25.010 --> 02:25:26.010]  How huge was
[02:25:26.010 --> 02:25:28.010]  the weaponization hearings
[02:25:28.010 --> 02:25:29.010]  and the admission
[02:25:29.010 --> 02:25:30.010]  that Fauci basically runs
[02:25:30.010 --> 02:25:31.010]  the COVID response
[02:25:31.010 --> 02:25:32.010]  out of the CIA?
[02:25:32.010 --> 02:25:33.010]  I mean,
[02:25:33.010 --> 02:25:34.010]  it's incredible.
[02:25:34.010 --> 02:25:35.010]  You know,
[02:25:35.010 --> 02:25:36.010]  who was it?
[02:25:36.010 --> 02:25:37.010]  I was just listening
[02:25:37.010 --> 02:25:38.010]  to Jeffrey Sachs.
[02:25:38.010 --> 02:25:39.010]  He might be an interesting
[02:25:39.010 --> 02:25:40.010]  guest for you to have.
[02:25:40.010 --> 02:25:41.010]  This was a guy
[02:25:41.010 --> 02:25:42.010]  who's completely in
[02:25:42.010 --> 02:25:43.010]  with the Great Reset agenda,
[02:25:43.010 --> 02:25:44.010]  the United Nations,
[02:25:44.010 --> 02:25:45.010]  World Health.
[02:25:45.010 --> 02:25:46.010]  He was put on a commission
[02:25:46.010 --> 02:25:47.010]  to investigate the origins
[02:25:47.010 --> 02:25:48.010]  of the Wuhan lab.
[02:25:48.010 --> 02:25:50.010]  And he was shot.
[02:25:50.010 --> 02:25:52.010]  Decades-long friends,
[02:25:52.010 --> 02:25:54.010]  including Peter Hosek
[02:25:54.010 --> 02:25:56.010]  and Anthony Fauci,
[02:25:56.010 --> 02:25:58.010]  he realized in his own words,
[02:25:58.010 --> 02:25:59.010]  quote,
[02:25:59.010 --> 02:26:00.010]  tantamount to fraud,
[02:26:00.010 --> 02:26:01.010]  that they locked him up
[02:26:01.010 --> 02:26:03.010]  for a couple of months.
[02:26:03.010 --> 02:26:05.010]  And he is now being red-pilled.
[02:26:05.010 --> 02:26:07.010]  I watched him in an interview
[02:26:07.010 --> 02:26:09.010]  processing what happened to him.
[02:26:09.010 --> 02:26:10.010]  This is another...
[02:26:10.010 --> 02:26:11.010]  Start over on him.
[02:26:11.010 --> 02:26:12.010]  Your mic cut out.
[02:26:12.010 --> 02:26:14.010]  Start over with this whistleblower.
[02:26:14.010 --> 02:26:16.010]  Oh, his name is Jeffrey Sachs.
[02:26:16.010 --> 02:26:18.010]  He's basically been all-in
[02:26:18.010 --> 02:26:19.010]  on the Great Reset,
[02:26:19.010 --> 02:26:20.010]  United Nations,
[02:26:20.010 --> 02:26:22.010]  globalist agenda.
[02:26:22.010 --> 02:26:23.010]  But he was selected
[02:26:23.010 --> 02:26:24.010]  a few years ago
[02:26:24.010 --> 02:26:26.010]  to study the Wuhan lab
[02:26:26.010 --> 02:26:28.010]  origin of the virus.
[02:26:28.010 --> 02:26:30.010]  And he was red-pilled
[02:26:30.010 --> 02:26:31.010]  because Peter Hosek
[02:26:31.010 --> 02:26:33.010]  and Anthony Fauci,
[02:26:33.010 --> 02:26:35.010]  lifelong friends of his,
[02:26:35.010 --> 02:26:36.010]  essentially,
[02:26:36.010 --> 02:26:38.010]  he caught them lying to him,
[02:26:38.010 --> 02:26:39.010]  covering up
[02:26:39.010 --> 02:26:42.010]  and manipulating him personally.
[02:26:42.010 --> 02:26:43.010]  He now says what they did
[02:26:43.010 --> 02:26:44.010]  was, quote,
[02:26:44.010 --> 02:26:45.010]  tantamount to fraud.
[02:26:45.010 --> 02:26:46.010]  Well, I love how they met
[02:26:46.010 --> 02:26:47.010]  with the CIA,
[02:26:47.010 --> 02:26:48.010]  seven doctors,
[02:26:48.010 --> 02:26:49.010]  and one of them said
[02:26:49.010 --> 02:26:50.010]  it was not lab.
[02:26:50.010 --> 02:26:51.010]  All the others...
[02:26:51.010 --> 02:26:52.010]  And so they paid him off.
[02:26:52.010 --> 02:26:53.010]  Yes.
[02:26:53.010 --> 02:26:54.010]  But this was an example
[02:26:54.010 --> 02:26:55.010]  of how fast...
[02:26:55.010 --> 02:26:57.010]  This man who knew Fauci personally,
[02:26:57.010 --> 02:26:58.010]  this is...
[02:26:58.010 --> 02:26:59.010]  He actually said
[02:26:59.010 --> 02:27:00.010]  he had no idea
[02:27:00.010 --> 02:27:01.010]  that Anthony Fauci
[02:27:01.010 --> 02:27:02.010]  was part of
[02:27:02.010 --> 02:27:04.010]  the national security apparatus
[02:27:04.010 --> 02:27:05.010]  in the United States.
[02:27:05.010 --> 02:27:06.010]  That's how well...
[02:27:06.010 --> 02:27:07.010]  I don't want to say
[02:27:07.010 --> 02:27:08.010]  it was a secret,
[02:27:08.010 --> 02:27:09.010]  but it was definitely
[02:27:09.010 --> 02:27:10.010]  known by people.
[02:27:10.010 --> 02:27:11.010]  But just no one
[02:27:11.010 --> 02:27:12.010]  ever thought of it.
[02:27:12.010 --> 02:27:13.010]  Everyone just thought
[02:27:13.010 --> 02:27:14.010]  he was this guy
[02:27:14.010 --> 02:27:15.010]  who dealt with medicine.
[02:27:15.010 --> 02:27:16.010]  No, he's the highest level.
[02:27:16.010 --> 02:27:17.010]  We've got one minute left.
[02:27:17.010 --> 02:27:18.010]  Your book,
[02:27:18.010 --> 02:27:19.010]  The Great Reset,
[02:27:19.010 --> 02:27:20.010]  Mark Moreno.
[02:27:20.010 --> 02:27:21.010]  Everybody should get
[02:27:21.010 --> 02:27:22.010]  it, climatedebatebook.com.
[02:27:22.010 --> 02:27:23.010]  One-minute closing comment.
[02:27:23.010 --> 02:27:24.010]  You've got to join us again soon.
[02:27:24.010 --> 02:27:25.010]  All right.
[02:27:25.010 --> 02:27:26.010]  My closing comment
[02:27:26.010 --> 02:27:27.010]  on the climate debate
[02:27:27.010 --> 02:27:29.130]  I saw happen firsthand
[02:27:29.130 --> 02:27:30.490]  in the COVID debate.
[02:27:30.490 --> 02:27:31.490]  If you thought
[02:27:31.490 --> 02:27:32.490]  the Great Barrington Declaration,
[02:27:32.490 --> 02:27:33.930]  where the scientists spoke out,
[02:27:33.930 --> 02:27:34.930]  were called fringe epidemiologists,
[02:27:34.930 --> 02:27:35.930]  despite the fact
[02:27:35.930 --> 02:27:36.930]  they were from Harvard
[02:27:36.930 --> 02:27:37.930]  and Yale
[02:27:37.930 --> 02:27:40.130]  and had Nobel Prize-winning chemists,
[02:27:40.130 --> 02:27:41.130]  they were deplatformed,
[02:27:41.130 --> 02:27:42.130]  canceled, censored.
[02:27:42.130 --> 02:27:43.130]  I saw the same thing
[02:27:43.130 --> 02:27:44.130]  in climate.
[02:27:44.130 --> 02:27:45.130]  This...
[02:27:45.130 --> 02:27:47.170]  on absolutely
[02:27:47.170 --> 02:27:48.650]  the entire population.
[02:27:48.650 --> 02:27:50.370]  We can't allow this to happen.
[02:27:50.370 --> 02:27:51.370]  They are literally
[02:27:51.370 --> 02:27:52.450]  turning the once-free West
[02:27:52.450 --> 02:27:54.450]  into one-party Chinese rule.
[02:27:54.450 --> 02:27:55.450]  We've got to fight
[02:27:55.450 --> 02:27:56.730]  this emergency power reform.
[02:27:56.730 --> 02:27:58.010]  We have to not comply
[02:27:58.010 --> 02:27:59.810]  at every single level.
[02:27:59.810 --> 02:28:01.410]  And we have to fight immediately
[02:28:01.410 --> 02:28:02.650]  this pandemic treaty,
[02:28:02.650 --> 02:28:03.650]  which is probably
[02:28:03.650 --> 02:28:04.650]  the number one threat we face
[02:28:04.650 --> 02:28:05.930]  because the Biden administration
[02:28:05.930 --> 02:28:07.410]  is really pushing that.
[02:28:07.410 --> 02:28:08.690]  And we know from our history,
[02:28:08.690 --> 02:28:09.690]  once we get entangled
[02:28:09.690 --> 02:28:10.690]  in these things,
[02:28:10.690 --> 02:28:11.690]  we can never really get out.
[02:28:11.690 --> 02:28:12.690]  George H.W. Bush
[02:28:12.690 --> 02:28:13.690]  got us involved
[02:28:13.690 --> 02:28:14.690]  in the U.N. climate process,
[02:28:14.690 --> 02:28:16.850]  1992, at the Rio Earth Summit.
[02:28:16.850 --> 02:28:17.850]  We're still,
[02:28:17.850 --> 02:28:19.770]  10 years later,
[02:28:19.770 --> 02:28:20.770]  deeply steeped in it.
[02:28:20.770 --> 02:28:21.770]  Well, that's right.
[02:28:21.770 --> 02:28:22.770]  You exposed
[02:28:22.770 --> 02:28:23.770]  agenda 21 first
[02:28:23.770 --> 02:28:24.770]  in the Senate.
[02:28:24.770 --> 02:28:26.490]  What do we do to stop this?
[02:28:26.490 --> 02:28:27.970]  Again, the biggest thing
[02:28:27.970 --> 02:28:29.690]  we can do is not comply
[02:28:29.690 --> 02:28:31.410]  and pressure your elected leaders
[02:28:31.410 --> 02:28:33.490]  to challenge the narrative.
[02:28:33.490 --> 02:28:34.490]  We can't be like
[02:28:34.490 --> 02:28:35.850]  Richie Rich Sunak,
[02:28:35.850 --> 02:28:37.250]  the prime minister of U.K.,
[02:28:37.250 --> 02:28:38.250]  like, well,
[02:28:38.250 --> 02:28:39.450]  I'm all in for the net-zero agenda,
[02:28:39.450 --> 02:28:40.450]  but we're just going to
[02:28:40.450 --> 02:28:41.450]  push it back five years.
[02:28:41.450 --> 02:28:42.450]  And he gets attacked
[02:28:42.450 --> 02:28:43.450]  because he's some kind
[02:28:43.450 --> 02:28:44.850]  of evil climate denier.
[02:28:44.850 --> 02:28:45.850]  We need to go after
[02:28:45.850 --> 02:28:46.930]  the agenda head-on.
[02:28:46.930 --> 02:28:47.930]  We need to defeat
[02:28:47.930 --> 02:28:50.370]  the pandemic treaty
[02:28:50.370 --> 02:28:51.370]  from the WHO.
[02:28:51.370 --> 02:28:52.370]  And we need to fight
[02:28:52.370 --> 02:28:53.370]  emergency power.
[02:28:53.370 --> 02:28:54.730]  We need to fight voting access.
[02:28:54.730 --> 02:28:55.730]  And we need to fight
[02:28:55.730 --> 02:28:56.730]  for free speech.
[02:28:56.730 --> 02:28:57.730]  Wow.
[02:28:57.730 --> 02:29:00.090]  We cannot allow it.
[02:29:00.090 --> 02:29:01.090]  Last year,
[02:29:01.090 --> 02:29:02.090]  we put this book out,
[02:29:02.090 --> 02:29:03.090]  The Great Reset
[02:29:03.090 --> 02:29:04.090]  in the War for the World.
[02:29:04.090 --> 02:29:05.090]  It became a number one
[02:29:05.090 --> 02:29:06.090]  national bestseller.
[02:29:06.090 --> 02:29:07.410]  Now we've put part two out.
[02:29:07.410 --> 02:29:08.410]  It's even thicker
[02:29:08.410 --> 02:29:09.690]  and more powerful.
[02:29:09.690 --> 02:29:10.690]  The Great Awakening,
[02:29:10.690 --> 02:29:11.690]  the plan to defeat
[02:29:11.690 --> 02:29:12.690]  the globalists
[02:29:12.690 --> 02:29:13.690]  and launch the second
[02:29:13.690 --> 02:29:15.010]  great renaissance.
[02:29:15.010 --> 02:29:16.970]  This is such a powerful book.
[02:29:16.970 --> 02:29:17.970]  It covers all
[02:29:17.970 --> 02:29:18.970]  the globalist plans,
[02:29:18.970 --> 02:29:20.650]  the latest developments,
[02:29:20.650 --> 02:29:21.650]  how to stop them,
[02:29:21.650 --> 02:29:23.290]  and then gives an alternate plan
[02:29:23.290 --> 02:29:24.290]  of a society
[02:29:24.290 --> 02:29:26.050]  we could build together.
[02:29:26.050 --> 02:29:27.050]  That's why it's
[02:29:27.050 --> 02:29:28.050]  The Great Awakening.
[02:29:28.050 --> 02:29:29.050]  The Great Awakening

[02:32:58.430 --> 02:32:59.430]  Leading a frontal assault
[02:32:59.430 --> 02:33:00.430]  on the lies
[02:33:00.430 --> 02:33:02.430]  of the New World Order,
[02:33:02.430 --> 02:33:04.430]  it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:06.620 --> 02:33:30.620]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:31.620 --> 02:33:40.620]  We're farmers.
[02:33:40.620 --> 02:33:45.620]  We're growing.
[02:33:45.620 --> 02:33:50.620]  A pro-human future.
[02:33:50.620 --> 02:33:55.620]  I really appreciate Marjorie Taylor Greene, such a beautiful, amazing person.
[02:33:55.620 --> 02:34:00.620]  She's won by the biggest margin in the last two elections in Georgia.
[02:34:00.620 --> 02:34:05.620]  They tried to disqualify her from running by doing President Trump, but she hasn't backed down.
[02:34:05.620 --> 02:34:07.620]  She's gotten even stronger.
[02:34:07.620 --> 02:34:10.620]  She tried to work with McCarthy to get him to do the right thing.
[02:34:10.620 --> 02:34:13.620]  And now she's supporting Trump for the speakership.
[02:34:13.620 --> 02:34:16.620]  We'll explain the law that you don't have to have someone that's in Congress to be the speaker.
[02:34:16.620 --> 02:34:19.620]  This is one of the great things about our Constitution.
[02:34:19.620 --> 02:34:23.620]  So she joins us now for the next 25 minutes.
[02:34:23.620 --> 02:34:24.620]  She's an amazing lady.
[02:34:24.620 --> 02:34:26.620]  What a time to be alive.
[02:34:26.620 --> 02:34:27.620]  Some say we don't have a plan.
[02:34:27.620 --> 02:34:31.620]  Well, at least we're not going along with the status quo.
[02:34:31.620 --> 02:34:32.620]  That's what it's all about.
[02:34:32.620 --> 02:34:34.620]  So, Marjorie Taylor Greene, thank you on short notice.
[02:34:34.620 --> 02:34:37.620]  We just called you a few hours ago to come on with us.
[02:34:37.620 --> 02:34:43.620]  I'm going to try to shut up and give you the floor to talk about what happened yesterday and what's coming in the future.
[02:34:43.620 --> 02:34:45.620]  Well, first of all, thank you to you, Alex.
[02:34:45.620 --> 02:34:47.620]  You know, I think you're one of the originals.
[02:34:47.620 --> 02:34:50.620]  You are truly one of the greatest.
[02:34:50.620 --> 02:34:57.620]  So I'm always happy to come on your show and talk with you and talk to your viewers about what's happening in Washington.
[02:34:57.620 --> 02:34:59.620]  You know, I've been saying it like this.
[02:34:59.620 --> 02:35:01.620]  It's really interesting times.
[02:35:01.620 --> 02:35:03.620]  Hunter Biden was arrested yesterday.
[02:35:03.620 --> 02:35:08.620]  We had a Democrat congressman get carjacked here in Washington, D.C. the other day.
[02:35:08.620 --> 02:35:14.620]  We had Jamal Bowman, a Democrat from New York, pull a fire alarm to stop a vote.
[02:35:14.620 --> 02:35:18.620]  Bob Menendez, a Democrat senator, gets indicted.
[02:35:18.620 --> 02:35:21.620]  But we threw out our Republican speaker last night.
[02:35:21.620 --> 02:35:27.620]  I will have to say we really got to get our act together because the country's on fire.
[02:35:27.620 --> 02:35:29.620]  It is.
[02:35:29.620 --> 02:35:31.620]  And the crime is out of control.
[02:35:31.620 --> 02:35:34.620]  So talk about what you witnessed in Congress.
[02:35:34.620 --> 02:35:35.620]  It's historical.
[02:35:35.620 --> 02:35:37.620]  And there's different paths to go down.
[02:35:37.620 --> 02:35:38.620]  But now we're here.
[02:35:38.620 --> 02:35:40.620]  Who do you think the next speaker may be?
[02:35:40.620 --> 02:35:41.620]  Matt Gaetz.
[02:35:41.620 --> 02:35:43.620]  You know, Trump agreed with you.
[02:35:43.620 --> 02:35:45.620]  He said leave McCarthy alone.
[02:35:45.620 --> 02:35:46.620]  So I'm not attacking you or Trump.
[02:35:46.620 --> 02:35:47.620]  I respect you.
[02:35:47.620 --> 02:35:48.620]  I respect Trump.
[02:35:48.620 --> 02:35:49.620]  I respect their perspectives.
[02:35:49.620 --> 02:35:53.620]  But at the same time, people see Trump being persecuted.
[02:35:53.620 --> 02:35:56.620]  They see people not going after the Bidens quick enough.
[02:35:56.620 --> 02:36:00.620]  And so I see this as a symbol of the angst happening.
[02:36:00.620 --> 02:36:02.620]  Yeah, I totally agree.
[02:36:02.620 --> 02:36:06.620]  Now, that's where I've been agreeing with Matt Gaetz all day yesterday and all day today.
[02:36:06.620 --> 02:36:09.620]  Matt Gaetz said we need change in Washington, D.C.
[02:36:09.620 --> 02:36:12.620]  And he is absolutely right.
[02:36:12.620 --> 02:36:14.620]  He and I are very good friends, and we're close allies.
[02:36:14.620 --> 02:36:19.620]  And just because we weren't voting together last night doesn't mean that we're not on the same team.
[02:36:19.620 --> 02:36:20.620]  Yeah, we're not in a cult.
[02:36:20.620 --> 02:36:24.620]  And anybody that attacks you for supporting McCarthy, then attack Trump.
[02:36:24.620 --> 02:36:26.620]  Trump came to the same calculus.
[02:36:26.620 --> 02:36:29.620]  Let's talk about that calculus, because I respect that.
[02:36:29.620 --> 02:36:31.620]  And let's talk about the new calculus.
[02:36:31.620 --> 02:36:33.620]  Yes, you're absolutely right.
[02:36:33.620 --> 02:36:34.620]  The new calculus is this.
[02:36:34.620 --> 02:36:39.620]  We only have one choice to save America, Alex, and it's President Trump.
[02:36:39.620 --> 02:36:42.620]  I've supported President Trump from the beginning, just like you have.
[02:36:42.620 --> 02:36:44.620]  President Trump has a four-year proven record.
[02:36:44.620 --> 02:36:46.620]  His policies were working.
[02:36:46.620 --> 02:36:48.620]  His policies were stopping the globalists.
[02:36:48.620 --> 02:36:50.620]  His policies were against the communists.
[02:36:50.620 --> 02:36:52.620]  Plus, they hate him more than anybody.
[02:36:52.620 --> 02:36:56.620]  I mean, my God, they act like he's high noon to a vampire.
[02:36:56.620 --> 02:36:58.620]  That's right.
[02:36:58.620 --> 02:36:59.620]  They do hate him more than anybody.
[02:36:59.620 --> 02:37:01.620]  And you know who hates him the most?
[02:37:01.620 --> 02:37:03.620]  Washington, D.C.
[02:37:04.620 --> 02:37:10.620]  So I'm going into this next speaker's race, and the only candidate I am supporting is Donald John Trump.
[02:37:10.620 --> 02:37:11.620]  Yeah!
[02:37:11.620 --> 02:37:14.620]  Because Washington, D.C. needs to be reminded.
[02:37:14.620 --> 02:37:21.620]  This town needs to wake up and accept the fact that Republican voters all over the country want him back in the White House.
[02:37:21.620 --> 02:37:28.620]  He's the only leader of the Republican Party, and he truly is the only person that we can trust to save America.
[02:37:28.620 --> 02:37:31.620]  And through that, Alex, that is saving the world.
[02:37:31.620 --> 02:37:36.620]  And there's many people all over the world hoping and praying that we put President Trump back in the White House.
[02:37:36.620 --> 02:37:37.620]  So, Congresswoman, I've been interrupting.
[02:37:37.620 --> 02:37:41.620]  I'm going to shut up and give you the floor to say that statement again because this isn't some dream.
[02:37:41.620 --> 02:37:47.620]  In the Constitution, people don't understand someone that's not a congresswoman or man can be the speaker.
[02:37:47.620 --> 02:37:49.620]  This can really happen.
[02:37:49.620 --> 02:37:57.620]  And imagine the message with the 91 charges and felony charges, the four indictments, all the civil fraud, all the lies.
[02:37:57.620 --> 02:37:59.620]  Imagine him as the speaker with the gavel.
[02:37:59.620 --> 02:38:01.620]  Can he do it while he's running for president?
[02:38:01.620 --> 02:38:03.620]  Give us the inside baseball on that.
[02:38:03.620 --> 02:38:04.620]  So lay it out slowly.
[02:38:04.620 --> 02:38:06.620]  I'm going to shut up.
[02:38:06.620 --> 02:38:07.620]  Okay.
[02:38:07.620 --> 02:38:09.620]  Alex, here's how it is.
[02:38:09.620 --> 02:38:11.620]  In America, anything can happen.
[02:38:11.620 --> 02:38:17.620]  And in the United States House of Representatives, anyone can be the speaker of the House.
[02:38:17.620 --> 02:38:19.620]  We just have to elect them.
[02:38:19.620 --> 02:38:29.620]  So that is why I am supporting our former president, the greatest president of my lifetime and your lifetime, Donald John Trump, to be speaker of the House.
[02:38:29.620 --> 02:38:31.620]  And it's because I support his policies.
[02:38:31.620 --> 02:38:33.620]  America supports his policies.
[02:38:33.620 --> 02:38:36.620]  They're the only policies that will save this country.
[02:38:36.620 --> 02:38:39.620]  But let's get into the weeds on how that works.
[02:38:39.620 --> 02:38:45.620]  So when Congress votes for a speaker, it will first start in our two separate conferences.
[02:38:45.620 --> 02:38:51.620]  The Republican conference, we will meet on our own and we will have what's called a candidate forum where we talk.
[02:38:51.620 --> 02:39:01.620]  Our different different people in our conference come forward and say they're running for speaker or we can nominate someone running for speaker from outside of Congress.
[02:39:01.620 --> 02:39:03.620]  The Democrats will do the same thing.
[02:39:03.620 --> 02:39:11.620]  They will meet in their conference and they will elect the candidate they want to bring forward for speaker of the House.
[02:39:11.620 --> 02:39:14.620]  They already have their leader, and that's Hakeem Jeffries.
[02:39:14.620 --> 02:39:22.620]  We know that Hakeem Jeffries would be the worst disaster to put in the speakership and we can never let him have the gavel.
[02:39:22.620 --> 02:39:36.620]  So what we have to do in our Republican conference is we have to work very hard to put someone in the speakership that we can trust to hold the gavel and wield power in the third seat in line to the presidency.
[02:39:36.620 --> 02:39:38.620]  Here's what that means.
[02:39:38.620 --> 02:39:43.620]  That means we have 222 Republican members of Congress.
[02:39:43.620 --> 02:39:49.620]  We're missing one right now because he stepped down to go be with with his wife.
[02:39:49.620 --> 02:39:53.620]  We have some members of Congress like Anna Paulina Luna, who's out.
[02:39:53.620 --> 02:39:56.620]  She just had a baby not too long ago.
[02:39:56.620 --> 02:39:59.620]  And sometimes we just don't have all of our members here.
[02:40:00.620 --> 02:40:10.620]  But it takes 218 votes on the House floor, 218 out of 435 to elect a speaker of the House.
[02:40:10.620 --> 02:40:12.620]  And that's what we will be doing.
[02:40:12.620 --> 02:40:15.620]  Everyone saw the speakers race back in January.
[02:40:15.620 --> 02:40:19.620]  We're going to go back and we're going to do the same thing all over again.
[02:40:19.620 --> 02:40:25.620]  And this time I'm going in with the only leader that I trust, and that's President Trump.
[02:40:25.620 --> 02:40:28.620]  I totally agree.
[02:40:28.620 --> 02:40:31.620]  Let's talk inside stuff here, which is important.
[02:40:31.620 --> 02:40:33.620]  You're an amazing person.
[02:40:33.620 --> 02:40:35.620]  Matt Gaetz is an amazing person.
[02:40:35.620 --> 02:40:36.620]  People said, which side are you on?
[02:40:36.620 --> 02:40:40.620]  I said, I get trying to get McCarthy to do the right thing, and I get what Matt Gaetz is saying.
[02:40:40.620 --> 02:40:43.620]  I'm going to support both paths, and we're going to see what happens.
[02:40:43.620 --> 02:40:50.620]  So, you know, the point is McCarthy didn't deliver on what he's saying, and now we're thrown into this whole disarray.
[02:40:50.620 --> 02:40:52.620]  But it excites the base.
[02:40:52.620 --> 02:40:54.620]  We're mad about the fake indictments.
[02:40:54.620 --> 02:40:55.620]  People are pissed.
[02:40:55.620 --> 02:40:56.620]  They want action.
[02:40:56.620 --> 02:40:58.620]  That's why I'm supporting this.
[02:40:58.620 --> 02:41:01.620]  But I supported you and McCarthy to see we do the right thing.
[02:41:01.620 --> 02:41:08.620]  Why was McCarthy hamstrung, or why was he so resigned once he said, OK, fine, vote me out, and by the way, I won't run again?
[02:41:08.620 --> 02:41:11.620]  What happened there?
[02:41:11.620 --> 02:41:15.620]  OK, so let's talk about what happened in general.
[02:41:15.620 --> 02:41:17.620]  Let's go back to January.
[02:41:17.620 --> 02:41:23.620]  In January, there was only one person that came forward and said they wanted to be Speaker of the House.
[02:41:23.620 --> 02:41:25.620]  That was Kevin McCarthy.
[02:41:25.620 --> 02:41:35.620]  We saw 15 rounds on the House floor where our conference proved that the only person our conference would support is Kevin McCarthy.
[02:41:35.620 --> 02:41:37.620]  So I decided to fully support him.
[02:41:37.620 --> 02:41:39.620]  So you supported your Republican colleagues?
[02:41:39.620 --> 02:41:46.620]  Yes, I supported the Republican conference because I wanted to get things done for the country, Alex.
[02:41:46.620 --> 02:41:48.620]  And I'll tell you what I got out of it.
[02:41:48.620 --> 02:41:49.620]  I'm very proud.
[02:41:49.620 --> 02:41:54.620]  I got out of it an impeachment inquiry because I believe Joe Biden should be impeached.
[02:41:54.620 --> 02:41:56.620]  That's right. The impeachment has begun thanks to you.
[02:41:56.620 --> 02:41:57.620]  You spearheaded that.
[02:41:57.620 --> 02:42:00.620]  Yes, I spearheaded that and I got what I wanted.
[02:42:00.620 --> 02:42:02.620]  Then that was through Kevin McCarthy.
[02:42:02.620 --> 02:42:06.620]  I've also been fighting against funding the war in Ukraine.
[02:42:06.620 --> 02:42:07.620]  That has to stop.
[02:42:07.620 --> 02:42:09.620]  By the way, I'm not kissing your ass.
[02:42:09.620 --> 02:42:11.620]  That takes amazing courage.
[02:42:11.620 --> 02:42:16.620]  You have literally been at the tip of the spear opposing unlimited funding.
[02:42:16.620 --> 02:42:19.620]  It has to be done.
[02:42:19.620 --> 02:42:24.620]  People do not understand what a dangerous situation we are, not just here in our country.
[02:42:24.620 --> 02:42:29.620]  They're about to cut our own troops funding off in a shutdown, but Ukraine gets money?
[02:42:29.620 --> 02:42:30.620]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:42:30.620 --> 02:42:31.620]  That's right.
[02:42:31.620 --> 02:42:39.620]  The Pentagon was going to send or was planning to send money to Ukraine, continue funding their government, continue funding their war,
[02:42:39.620 --> 02:42:47.620]  continue paying their farmers, continue paying their first responders, continue paying fancy knit wear, whatever that is,
[02:42:47.620 --> 02:42:48.620]  all their small businesses.
[02:42:48.620 --> 02:42:52.620]  But they were not going to pay our military troops in case of a shutdown.
[02:42:52.620 --> 02:42:57.620]  At the same time, they allow our border to be invaded every single day.
[02:42:57.620 --> 02:43:03.620]  Alex, if we want to talk about Ukraine, it's the biggest money laundering scam in world history.
[02:43:03.620 --> 02:43:09.620]  And that money is going directly back into Democrat pockets, Democrat politicians, Democrat groups,
[02:43:09.620 --> 02:43:13.620]  Democrat nonprofits that are all funding.
[02:43:13.620 --> 02:43:14.620]  That's my next question.
[02:43:15.620 --> 02:43:16.620]  What about the new agenda?
[02:43:16.620 --> 02:43:22.620]  We get a new speaker cutting off funding to Jack Smith and these persecutions and cutting off Ukraine funding.
[02:43:22.620 --> 02:43:24.620]  Tell us about that.
[02:43:24.620 --> 02:43:25.620]  Yes, exactly.
[02:43:25.620 --> 02:43:26.620]  That's what I'm supporting.
[02:43:26.620 --> 02:43:29.620]  So I have also made my own list.
[02:43:29.620 --> 02:43:31.620]  I have a list of demands.
[02:43:31.620 --> 02:43:36.620]  And any future Republican speaker is going to have to meet my list of demands.
[02:43:36.620 --> 02:43:39.620]  My list of demands are pretty much the red lines I've had in the sand.
[02:43:39.620 --> 02:43:43.620]  Number one, no more funding to Ukraine.
[02:43:43.620 --> 02:43:44.620]  That country needs peace.
[02:43:44.620 --> 02:43:46.620]  We need to stop World War III.
[02:43:46.620 --> 02:43:49.620]  Number two, we have to fight the weaponized government.
[02:43:49.620 --> 02:43:55.620]  That is communism actually existing and holding power and persecuting people today.
[02:43:55.620 --> 02:44:05.620]  They're going after their political enemies all the way from President Trump down to MAGA grandmas that walk through the Capitol on January 6th and pro-life protesters.
[02:44:05.620 --> 02:44:06.620]  This has to end.
[02:44:07.620 --> 02:44:23.620]  I actually have an amendment that we can use or a bill that we can pass on the House floor that stops the Department of Justice from being able to fund their own special counsels and brings it back constitutionally to Congress because Congress writes the checks.
[02:44:23.620 --> 02:44:31.620]  So Congress needs to be the one that funds the special counsels and require the Department of Justice to come to us and get permission.
[02:44:31.620 --> 02:44:34.620]  And I'm told we're very close to that.
[02:44:34.620 --> 02:44:39.620]  So overall, who are you supporting?
[02:44:39.620 --> 02:44:40.620]  I know you're supporting Trump.
[02:44:40.620 --> 02:44:42.620]  Do you think he'll accept that commission?
[02:44:43.620 --> 02:44:46.620]  I think President Trump would accept it.
[02:44:46.620 --> 02:44:47.620]  I do.
[02:44:47.620 --> 02:44:49.620]  And I think it would be on an interim basis.
[02:44:49.620 --> 02:44:56.620]  And I think it would be the greatest thing that could happen because Washington, D.C. constantly is fighting against President Trump.
[02:44:56.620 --> 02:44:59.620]  This is the epicenter of globalism.
[02:44:59.620 --> 02:45:03.620]  This is where the communist layer exists is in Washington, D.C.
[02:45:03.620 --> 02:45:09.620]  And they could not they could probably not even imagine President Trump being speaker of the House.
[02:45:09.620 --> 02:45:12.620]  But that's exactly who should be speaker of the House right now.
[02:45:12.620 --> 02:45:13.620]  And I'll tell you why.
[02:45:14.620 --> 02:45:15.620]  What do we do to make that happen?
[02:45:17.620 --> 02:45:24.620]  Everybody needs to call in to every single representative in Congress, every single Republican, because you want to know something, Alex?
[02:45:25.620 --> 02:45:29.620]  All the voters voted for the representatives that I work with here.
[02:45:29.620 --> 02:45:35.620]  And President Trump, if they're a Republican, very likely endorsed their Republican representative.
[02:45:35.620 --> 02:45:40.620]  And that means that they won their election with the help of President Trump.
[02:45:40.620 --> 02:45:43.620]  Well, it's time to come back and it's time to help President Trump.
[02:45:43.620 --> 02:45:53.620]  We need to make him speaker of the House for an interim time period so that we can right the ship and we can actually do the right thing in the House of Representatives.
[02:45:53.620 --> 02:45:55.620]  And imagine that message that we're putting on screen.
[02:45:55.620 --> 02:45:57.620]  House.gov for its representatives.
[02:45:57.620 --> 02:46:01.620]  It has all the phone numbers to all your Congress people, particularly Republicans.
[02:46:01.620 --> 02:46:03.620]  And imagine the image while they've demonized him and attacked him.
[02:46:03.620 --> 02:46:07.620]  He's got the gavel for six months that it's got to happen.
[02:46:07.620 --> 02:46:11.620]  And I know he was trying to be nice like you and McCarthy, hoping he wants to make deals.
[02:46:11.620 --> 02:46:13.620]  But, man, now this has happened.
[02:46:13.620 --> 02:46:16.620]  He's got to I think he's just start lobbying right now.
[02:46:16.620 --> 02:46:17.620]  This needs to happen.
[02:46:19.620 --> 02:46:20.620]  Well, I don't know if he's doing that.
[02:46:20.620 --> 02:46:24.620]  You know, today he's in Manhattan being persecuted in another courtroom.
[02:46:24.620 --> 02:46:30.620]  And this is actually helping him win his election because the American people are not stupid.
[02:46:30.620 --> 02:46:42.620]  No matter what the media tries to tell him, no matter what the media lies about, the American people see these court cases, this fraud, some case of fraud, which is a fraud in itself.
[02:46:42.620 --> 02:46:48.620]  People like Fannie Willis, Letitia James, Jack Smith, all these people are there.
[02:46:48.620 --> 02:46:50.620]  They're completely abusing their power.
[02:46:50.620 --> 02:46:52.620]  So he's busy doing that today.
[02:46:52.620 --> 02:46:54.620]  And I really support him fighting to defend.
[02:46:54.620 --> 02:46:55.620]  I do as well.
[02:46:55.620 --> 02:46:57.620]  But I don't want to just talk about it.
[02:46:57.620 --> 02:47:00.620]  Speaker, let's draft him and make him do it.
[02:47:00.620 --> 02:47:01.620]  What do we do to do that?
[02:47:02.620 --> 02:47:06.620]  Well, I have to nominate him, and I certainly plan on nominating him.
[02:47:06.620 --> 02:47:10.620]  And people should call my friend Matt Gates because I told Matt, you know what?
[02:47:10.620 --> 02:47:15.620]  We should be nominating Donald John Speaker of the House.
[02:47:15.620 --> 02:47:18.620]  And I think everyone should get on board and let him know.
[02:47:18.620 --> 02:47:28.620]  Hey, listen, if the people the people's will can remove a speaker of the House, then I think the people's will should be able to put the next speaker of the House.
[02:47:28.620 --> 02:47:31.620]  Well, Marjorie Taylor Greene, the greatest congressperson up there right now.
[02:47:31.620 --> 02:47:32.620]  I'll just say it.
[02:47:33.620 --> 02:47:39.620]  The optics of him coming in and being put as a speaker trumps all of this pun intended.
[02:47:39.620 --> 02:47:40.620]  He's got to do it.
[02:47:40.620 --> 02:47:43.620]  We've got we've got to not just this is this needs to happen.
[02:47:43.620 --> 02:47:44.620]  Do you have any idea on the number of votes?
[02:47:44.620 --> 02:47:45.620]  What do we do?
[02:47:46.620 --> 02:47:52.620]  Well, we have to get the votes together to do it, and that requires people letting their representative know.
[02:47:52.620 --> 02:47:53.620]  And that's what my job is.
[02:47:53.620 --> 02:47:54.620]  I'm a representative.
[02:47:54.620 --> 02:47:57.620]  I represent my district, Georgia 14.
[02:47:57.620 --> 02:48:04.620]  And I know my district would love it more than anything to see President Trump be an interim speaker of the House.
[02:48:04.620 --> 02:48:07.620]  So I'm doing exactly what my district wants.
[02:48:07.620 --> 02:48:12.620]  And I have to remind every other representative that the people that voted for them and put them in office.
[02:48:12.620 --> 02:48:13.620]  Guess what?
[02:48:13.620 --> 02:48:14.620]  They voted for President Trump.
[02:48:14.620 --> 02:48:21.620]  President Trump received more Republican votes than any Republican presidential candidate in history.
[02:48:21.620 --> 02:48:23.620]  He won in 2016.
[02:48:23.620 --> 02:48:24.620]  He won in 2020.
[02:48:24.620 --> 02:48:30.620]  He will win again in 2024 because he's winning the primary by the biggest numbers we've ever seen.
[02:48:30.620 --> 02:48:34.620]  He's also winning the general poll after poll after poll.
[02:48:34.620 --> 02:48:39.620]  And Joe Biden is the most corrupt criminal president we've ever had in United States history.
[02:48:39.620 --> 02:48:40.620]  All right.
[02:48:40.620 --> 02:48:41.620]  You've got to go in six minutes.
[02:48:41.620 --> 02:48:42.620]  We'll finish up with you after you leave.
[02:48:42.620 --> 02:48:44.620]  I'm going to shut up, put a sock in my mouth.
[02:48:45.620 --> 02:48:47.620]  M.T.G., you're incredible.
[02:48:47.620 --> 02:48:49.620]  I want you to be the president, but that'll come later.
[02:48:49.620 --> 02:48:54.620]  Tell us right now in closing the next six minutes, I'm going to literally turn my mic off.
[02:48:54.620 --> 02:48:59.620]  What else you want to impart to this audience of probably five million people right now conservatively tuned in?
[02:49:00.620 --> 02:49:07.620]  OK, I think for what people what you need to realize is we are a country in true peril right now.
[02:49:07.620 --> 02:49:12.620]  And I started out talking to you, Alex, today about the events of this week.
[02:49:12.620 --> 02:49:15.620]  And the Democrats are the one destroying our country.
[02:49:15.620 --> 02:49:19.620]  We've got Democrats pulling fire alarms, breaking federal law.
[02:49:19.620 --> 02:49:25.620]  The same laws that that we have Matthew Graves, the U.S. attorney here at the Department of Justice,
[02:49:25.620 --> 02:49:29.620]  locking up January 6th defendants to where they're rotting in jail.
[02:49:29.620 --> 02:49:33.620]  A congressman, a Democrat congressman, pulled that alarm and broke the same law.
[02:49:33.620 --> 02:49:35.620]  He's not sitting in the D.C. gulag.
[02:49:35.620 --> 02:49:43.620]  Crime is out of control in Washington, D.C., to the point where Democrat congressmen just got carjacked at gunpoint.
[02:49:43.620 --> 02:49:49.620]  This week, we have Democrat Senator Bob Menendez taking gold bars and being indicted.
[02:49:49.620 --> 02:49:53.620]  They're only throwing him under the bus because they're afraid they'll lose that Senate seat.
[02:49:53.620 --> 02:50:01.620]  You see, you have to understand the Democrats will only turn against one of their own if it's a for political reasons,
[02:50:01.620 --> 02:50:03.620]  if they think they're going to lose power.
[02:50:03.620 --> 02:50:06.620]  And that's why they turn on Bob Menendez.
[02:50:06.620 --> 02:50:13.620]  But they won't turn on Joe Biden yet because they think Joe Biden is the only chance to win the White House.
[02:50:13.620 --> 02:50:20.620]  Now, many are arguing that we won't see Joe Biden be the candidate that goes up against President Trump in 2024.
[02:50:20.620 --> 02:50:25.620]  And while that's yet to be seen, we have to recognize the situation we're in.
[02:50:25.620 --> 02:50:27.620]  The border is out of control.
[02:50:27.620 --> 02:50:36.620]  This town, Washington, D.C., every single person I work with is hell bent on sending billions of dollars to Ukraine,
[02:50:36.620 --> 02:50:39.620]  one of the most corrupt countries on Earth.
[02:50:39.620 --> 02:50:46.620]  And I'm sure Alex Jones has told all of you watching this show about the horrible child sex trafficking in Ukraine,
[02:50:46.620 --> 02:50:54.620]  about the organ harvesting of children in Ukraine, all of the Nazi soldiers that that fight in their military.
[02:50:54.620 --> 02:50:58.620]  And then yet we're attacked every single day and called called Nazis.
[02:50:58.620 --> 02:51:05.620]  Jamal Bowman sent out a memo, a talking point memo to all his colleagues calling Republican Nazis.
[02:51:05.620 --> 02:51:09.620]  But yet they're sending your hard earned tax dollars to fund a Nazi army in Ukraine.
[02:51:09.620 --> 02:51:11.620]  We are in serious trouble.
[02:51:11.620 --> 02:51:19.620]  So what we have to do right now, while we have an opportunity, a one time opportunity to pick another speaker of the House,
[02:51:19.620 --> 02:51:22.620]  we have to be realistic about what our options are.
[02:51:22.620 --> 02:51:29.620]  But we have to fight as hard as possible because, Alex, I'll tell you what, we don't win this election in 2024.
[02:51:29.620 --> 02:51:32.620]  I don't know what we're looking at in the future.
[02:51:32.620 --> 02:51:35.620]  And you've heard me talk about national divorce before.
[02:51:36.620 --> 02:51:44.620]  I think that'll definitely be a serious option on the table if the Democrats continue to retain power after 2024.
[02:51:44.620 --> 02:51:47.620]  In closing, you're gracious with your time on short notice.
[02:51:47.620 --> 02:51:50.620]  MTG, what else is on your radar?
[02:51:50.620 --> 02:51:52.620]  What else are you watching right now?
[02:51:52.620 --> 02:51:54.620]  What else? They've tried their new COVID rollout.
[02:51:54.620 --> 02:51:56.620]  They're having problems, but they're still doing it.
[02:51:56.620 --> 02:51:58.620]  Well, what else are you looking at?
[02:51:58.620 --> 02:52:02.620]  Yeah, they'd love to vaccinate everybody with another mRNA vaccine.
[02:52:02.620 --> 02:52:04.620]  That's what they want more than anything.
[02:52:04.620 --> 02:52:06.620]  And they want to make you pay for it.
[02:52:06.620 --> 02:52:08.620]  That's something I'd like to stop.
[02:52:08.620 --> 02:52:13.620]  I'm continuing to pressure my COVID committee that I'm not really happy with right now.
[02:52:13.620 --> 02:52:17.620]  I think we should be investigating all the VAERS reports on vaccine injury and deaths.
[02:52:17.620 --> 02:52:20.620]  And I'm very upset that my committee has not done that.
[02:52:20.620 --> 02:52:22.620]  So I'm demanding that to be done.
[02:52:22.620 --> 02:52:25.620]  And the next speaker of the House will have to support it.
[02:52:25.620 --> 02:52:31.620]  And I know President Trump would support that, even though it was Operation Warp Speed.
[02:52:31.620 --> 02:52:36.620]  You know, Mike Pence's program, and through President Trump, that we got the vaccines.
[02:52:36.620 --> 02:52:38.620]  But he never forced the mandates.
[02:52:38.620 --> 02:52:39.620]  No, he didn't.
[02:52:39.620 --> 02:52:44.620]  So in closing, I talked to Roger Stone.
[02:52:44.620 --> 02:52:45.620]  I've talked to you some.
[02:52:45.620 --> 02:52:47.620]  We had dinner a few weeks, a month ago.
[02:52:47.620 --> 02:52:49.620]  I'm told Trump is stronger than ever.
[02:52:49.620 --> 02:52:51.620]  What type of guy under this attack?
[02:52:51.620 --> 02:52:52.620]  Because I've been attacked a lot.
[02:52:52.620 --> 02:52:53.620]  I'm a fire.
[02:52:53.620 --> 02:52:54.620]  Yes, you are.
[02:52:54.620 --> 02:52:55.620]  I can survive it.
[02:52:55.620 --> 02:52:57.620]  He seems stronger.
[02:52:57.620 --> 02:53:00.620]  What is President Trump's demeanor like?
[02:53:00.620 --> 02:53:01.620]  What's his spirit like when you talk to him?
[02:53:01.620 --> 02:53:03.620]  I know all the time.
[02:53:03.620 --> 02:53:05.620]  It's a lot like yours, Alex.
[02:53:05.620 --> 02:53:07.620]  You're one of the toughest guys I know.
[02:53:07.620 --> 02:53:09.620]  And you have fought the radical left.
[02:53:09.620 --> 02:53:12.620]  You fought these communist bastards for so many years now.
[02:53:12.620 --> 02:53:15.620]  President Trump is convicted, just like you are.
[02:53:15.620 --> 02:53:19.620]  He has more energy of somebody than I've ever seen in my life.
[02:53:19.620 --> 02:53:21.620]  His stamina is incredible.
[02:53:21.620 --> 02:53:26.620]  But it's his conviction that is absolutely amazing.
[02:53:26.620 --> 02:53:29.620]  He's so convicted to win this next election.
[02:53:29.620 --> 02:53:34.620]  He's so convicted to defeat all of these awful charges they've brought against him
[02:53:34.620 --> 02:53:38.620]  and defeat the weaponized courtrooms and government against him
[02:53:38.620 --> 02:53:40.620]  because he truly loves America.
[02:53:40.620 --> 02:53:44.620]  He loves the American people, and he really wants to save this country.
[02:53:44.620 --> 02:53:48.620]  And it grieves his heart over where we are today.
[02:53:48.620 --> 02:53:50.620]  He's an easy person to stand with.
[02:53:50.620 --> 02:53:54.620]  He's an easy person to support because he's a regular guy.
[02:53:54.620 --> 02:53:58.620]  And honestly, he's so much fun to talk to and be around.
[02:53:58.620 --> 02:54:02.620]  He's truly inspiring, and he's the person that we have to bring back.
[02:54:02.620 --> 02:54:03.620]  Well, that's right.
[02:54:03.620 --> 02:54:08.620]  The silver lining to all this tyranny is I get to know people like you and Trump
[02:54:08.620 --> 02:54:13.620]  and Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan and all these liberals like RFK Jr.
[02:54:13.620 --> 02:54:16.620]  and Tulsi Gabbard and Joe Rogan are now on our side.
[02:54:16.620 --> 02:54:18.620]  We're winning the culture war.
[02:54:18.620 --> 02:54:22.620]  That's why the corrupt, evil, CHICOM-funded left is so panicked.
[02:54:22.620 --> 02:54:23.620]  That's right.
[02:54:23.620 --> 02:54:24.620]  We are winning.
[02:54:24.620 --> 02:54:27.620]  And I think one of the biggest issues that woke people up was COVID,
[02:54:27.620 --> 02:54:31.620]  but it's also been the trans agenda coming after our children.
[02:54:31.620 --> 02:54:33.620]  That was kind of a gift that came out of COVID.
[02:54:33.620 --> 02:54:37.620]  Parents started paying attention because the schools were shut down,
[02:54:37.620 --> 02:54:40.620]  and they saw the curriculums and the things our kids were being taught.
[02:54:40.620 --> 02:54:43.620]  But then they also started seeing what's on social media,
[02:54:43.620 --> 02:54:46.620]  and everyone's waking up to the fact that now there's so many kids,
[02:54:46.620 --> 02:54:50.620]  middle school and high school kids, that are having their body parts chopped off,
[02:54:50.620 --> 02:54:52.620]  and that doesn't make sense to anybody.
[02:54:52.620 --> 02:54:54.620]  But when you have the president of the United States
[02:54:54.620 --> 02:54:57.620]  and every single Democrat cheering for this,
[02:54:57.620 --> 02:55:00.620]  and then you have people like Governor Gavin Newsom in California
[02:55:00.620 --> 02:55:06.620]  protecting parents that want to chop off their kids' body parts,
[02:55:06.620 --> 02:55:10.620]  but also take away the rights from parents who want to protect their kids from that,
[02:55:10.620 --> 02:55:12.620]  everyone sees this for exactly what it is,
[02:55:12.620 --> 02:55:16.620]  and it's a Marxism strategy to rip apart this country.
[02:55:16.620 --> 02:55:19.620]  But, Alex, I'll tell you where we're in real trouble,
[02:55:19.620 --> 02:55:24.620]  is our country is being invaded by people from all over the world.
[02:55:24.620 --> 02:55:27.620]  Over 160 countries, people are coming in,
[02:55:27.620 --> 02:55:31.620]  and the Biden administration is giving full rights to these people,
[02:55:31.620 --> 02:55:34.620]  giving them work permits, giving them all kinds of—
[02:55:34.620 --> 02:55:38.620]  They're letting them bring in drug kids without their parents.
[02:55:38.620 --> 02:55:40.620]  Yeah, that's true.
[02:55:40.620 --> 02:55:43.620]  I talked to a Texas high school football coach this week,
[02:55:43.620 --> 02:55:46.620]  and he told me a story, and he was shocked.
[02:55:46.620 --> 02:55:49.620]  He said, I've been a high school football coach in Texas for years.
[02:55:49.620 --> 02:55:53.620]  He goes, every time we have an away game, we book charter buses for our players
[02:55:53.620 --> 02:55:58.620]  so we can go to the school, the school at the away game.
[02:55:58.620 --> 02:56:01.620]  And he said, we couldn't get charter buses this week
[02:56:01.620 --> 02:56:05.620]  because all of the buses are being used by the federal government
[02:56:05.620 --> 02:56:08.620]  to take illegal aliens all over the country.
[02:56:08.620 --> 02:56:13.620]  So this Texas high school football coach could not believe it,
[02:56:13.620 --> 02:56:16.620]  and they're getting paid, the charter buses are getting paid,
[02:56:16.620 --> 02:56:19.620]  triple the amounts that they normally get paid.
[02:56:19.620 --> 02:56:21.620]  It's not $10 million, it's $20 million a year.
[02:56:21.620 --> 02:56:23.620]  It is a total takeover.
[02:56:23.620 --> 02:56:26.620]  MTG, in closing, thank you for short notice coming on.
[02:56:26.620 --> 02:56:29.620]  Where are the best places for people to find the great work you're doing and magnify it?
[02:56:29.620 --> 02:56:31.620]  Not that it needs any help. You're exploding everywhere.
[02:56:31.620 --> 02:56:33.620]  I see your reports every week with 20 million views.
[02:56:33.620 --> 02:56:36.620]  Where do people find MTG?
[02:56:36.620 --> 02:56:40.620]  You can follow me at RepMTG on all social media,
[02:56:40.620 --> 02:56:43.620]  or you can look me up for Real Marjorie Green
[02:56:43.620 --> 02:56:47.620]  or at MTGreenie on X, formerly Twitter.
[02:56:47.620 --> 02:56:50.620]  I'd love for you to follow me, and thank you, Alex.
[02:56:50.620 --> 02:56:53.620]  It's always fun to talk to you, and I hope we can have dinner again soon.
[02:56:53.620 --> 02:56:55.620]  Oh, don't thank me. You are incredible.
[02:56:55.620 --> 02:56:57.620]  My wife loves you. You're an example to us all.
[02:56:57.620 --> 02:57:00.620]  That's why they attack you, because you are so smart.
[02:57:00.620 --> 02:57:03.620]  You're so on target, and everything they say is the opposite.
[02:57:03.620 --> 02:57:06.620]  MTG, we love you. Have a great week coming up,
[02:57:06.620 --> 02:57:08.620]  and God bless. We'll talk to you soon.
[02:57:08.620 --> 02:57:10.620]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:57:10.620 --> 02:57:13.620]  Man, that lady is incredible. Wow.
[02:57:13.620 --> 02:57:15.620]  And they are so scared of her.
[02:57:15.620 --> 02:57:18.620]  All right, folks. Thank you, MTG. What a sweetheart.
[02:57:18.620 --> 02:57:20.620]  She is a sweetheart.
[02:57:20.620 --> 02:57:22.620]  All right. I'm going to start the next hour.
[02:57:22.620 --> 02:57:24.620]  Hand the baton to Kate Dowling.
[02:57:24.620 --> 02:57:26.620]  But I got some other news I haven't hit yet,
[02:57:26.620 --> 02:57:28.620]  and we're going to hit it hard.
[02:57:28.620 --> 02:57:31.620]  Wow. I mean, wow.
[02:57:31.620 --> 02:57:32.620]  That's all I can say.
[02:57:32.620 --> 02:57:36.620]  I am so blessed to be in attack formation because of you.
[02:57:36.620 --> 02:57:38.620]  The only reason I'm still in the fight is you.
[02:57:38.620 --> 02:57:39.620]  Infowarsstore.com.

[02:57:46.620 --> 02:57:50.620]  Where were you when humanity was fighting for its life?
[02:57:50.620 --> 02:57:53.620]  Where were you when the globalists were caught
[02:57:53.620 --> 02:57:56.620]  trafficking millions of children for sex slavery worldwide?
[02:57:56.620 --> 02:57:58.620]  Where were you when the New World Order was starting
[02:57:58.620 --> 02:58:00.620]  World War III with Russia?
[02:58:00.620 --> 02:58:01.620]  Well, I know where you are.

[02:58:15.620 --> 02:58:19.620]  defeating the globalists, and launching the next great renaissance.
[02:58:19.620 --> 02:58:20.620]  This is my second book,
[02:58:20.620 --> 02:58:22.620]  part two of The Great Recent and War for the World.
[02:58:22.620 --> 02:58:26.620]  It's a longer book, quite frankly, a more powerful book.

[02:59:48.620 --> 02:59:52.620]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[02:59:52.620 --> 02:59:54.620]  it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:01.620 --> 03:00:03.620]  Yes, the times are dark.
[03:00:03.620 --> 03:00:07.620]  What we face is evil.
[03:00:07.620 --> 03:00:10.620]  But isn't that the animating contest?
[03:00:10.620 --> 03:00:13.620]  You weren't born on this beautiful planet in deep space
[03:00:13.620 --> 03:00:17.620]  to sit around and watch Netflix and the NFL.
[03:00:17.620 --> 03:00:20.620]  You were born to fight.
[03:00:20.620 --> 03:00:22.620]  You were born to fight.
[03:00:22.620 --> 03:00:24.620]  You were born to fight.
[03:00:24.620 --> 03:00:26.620]  You were born to fight.
[03:00:26.620 --> 03:00:29.620]  You were born for the NFL.
[03:00:29.620 --> 03:00:33.620]  You were born for what's happening now.
[03:00:33.620 --> 03:00:36.620]  And the fact that you're tuned in to this broadcast,
[03:00:36.620 --> 03:00:38.620]  the fact that you even care,
[03:00:38.620 --> 03:00:41.620]  shows you are part of the elect,
[03:00:41.620 --> 03:00:45.620]  the chosen, Sanhedrin,
[03:00:45.620 --> 03:00:48.620]  not those that claim to be the leaders,
[03:00:48.620 --> 03:00:50.620]  those that care.
[03:00:50.620 --> 03:00:53.620]  A magic moment in time and space.
[03:00:53.620 --> 03:00:56.620]  Look into my eyes one last time.
[03:00:56.620 --> 03:00:59.620]  My stories are almost over.
[03:00:59.620 --> 03:01:04.620]  My mission is almost complete.
[03:01:04.620 --> 03:01:09.620]  Chain reaction has been initiated.
[03:01:09.620 --> 03:01:11.620]  God is real.
[03:01:13.620 --> 03:01:19.620]  Here is Augustin Carstens,
[03:01:19.620 --> 03:01:22.620]  General Manager of the World Bank International Settlements.
[03:01:22.620 --> 03:01:24.620]  He runs all the major banks,
[03:01:24.620 --> 03:01:26.620]  which is the central bank of central banks,
[03:01:26.620 --> 03:01:28.620]  admits that CBDCs,
[03:01:28.620 --> 03:01:30.620]  Central Bank Digital Currencies,
[03:01:30.620 --> 03:01:33.620]  will grant central bankers absolute control
[03:01:33.620 --> 03:01:35.620]  over how we can be used
[03:01:35.620 --> 03:01:37.620]  and how the technology will be used
[03:01:37.620 --> 03:01:40.620]  and able to control and enforce control over society.
[03:01:40.620 --> 03:01:42.620]  Here's the clip.
[03:01:42.620 --> 03:01:46.620]  We tend to establish the equivalence with cash.
[03:01:46.620 --> 03:01:49.620]  And there is a huge difference there.
[03:01:49.620 --> 03:01:51.620]  For example, in cash,
[03:01:51.620 --> 03:01:52.620]  we don't know, for example,
[03:01:52.620 --> 03:01:55.620]  who is using a $100 bill today.
[03:01:55.620 --> 03:01:59.620]  We don't know who is using a 1,000-peso bill today.
[03:01:59.620 --> 03:02:03.620]  A key difference with the CBDC
[03:02:03.620 --> 03:02:07.620]  is that central bank will have absolute control
[03:02:07.620 --> 03:02:09.620]  on the rules and regulations
[03:02:09.620 --> 03:02:13.620]  that will determine the use of that expression
[03:02:13.620 --> 03:02:15.620]  of central bank liability.
[03:02:15.620 --> 03:02:19.620]  And also, we will have the technology to enforce that.
[03:02:19.620 --> 03:02:23.620]  Those two issues are extremely important.
[03:02:23.620 --> 03:02:26.620]  And that makes a huge difference
[03:02:26.620 --> 03:02:29.620]  with respect to what cash is.
[03:02:34.620 --> 03:02:38.620]  By the way, I didn't cover this yesterday or the day before.
[03:02:38.620 --> 03:02:39.620]  I meant to cover it
[03:02:39.620 --> 03:02:41.620]  because I think it's very illustrative
[03:02:41.620 --> 03:02:43.620]  of something that's very important.
[03:02:43.620 --> 03:02:45.620]  AI is not that powerful.
[03:02:45.620 --> 03:02:47.620]  It's a search engine of human ideas.
[03:02:47.620 --> 03:02:50.620]  It's a search engine of what humans produce.
[03:02:50.620 --> 03:02:52.620]  So we're told, roll over and die.
[03:02:52.620 --> 03:02:53.620]  The end of humans is here.
[03:02:53.620 --> 03:02:55.620]  The end of human civilization is real.
[03:02:55.620 --> 03:02:58.620]  Guys, get these photos I sent you
[03:02:58.620 --> 03:03:02.620]  of what AI believed the perfect woman was.
[03:03:02.620 --> 03:03:04.620]  One of the main AI systems they asked,
[03:03:04.620 --> 03:03:07.620]  what is the most beautiful woman?
[03:03:07.620 --> 03:03:09.620]  And what did a man want?
[03:03:09.620 --> 03:03:15.620]  What did a man want?
[03:03:15.620 --> 03:03:18.620]  Well, we'll talk about it next segment.
[03:03:18.620 --> 03:03:22.620]  What did a man want?
[03:03:22.620 --> 03:03:25.620]  What did men want?
[03:03:25.620 --> 03:03:26.620]  AI did a great job.
[03:03:26.620 --> 03:03:28.620]  But people are like, AI is incredible.
[03:03:28.620 --> 03:03:29.620]  Look at that.
[03:03:29.620 --> 03:03:31.620]  It just took what we thought
[03:03:31.620 --> 03:03:33.620]  and showed it back to us like a mirror.
[03:03:33.620 --> 03:03:35.620]  It's a plagiarist.
[03:03:35.620 --> 03:03:37.620]  Are these meth heads, skinny, ugly women?
[03:03:37.620 --> 03:03:39.620]  No.
[03:03:39.620 --> 03:03:42.620]  And why are they in police uniforms?
[03:03:42.620 --> 03:03:47.620]  I'm going to give you the big answer,
[03:03:47.620 --> 03:03:51.620]  which is a big, big answer for women as well.
[03:03:51.620 --> 03:03:53.620]  If you want to be in charge, women,
[03:03:53.620 --> 03:03:57.620]  step into your office.
[03:03:57.620 --> 03:03:59.620]  But the office the globalists have given you
[03:03:59.620 --> 03:04:03.620]  is an office of failure.
[03:04:03.620 --> 03:04:04.620]  We're going to talk about that.
[03:04:04.620 --> 03:04:05.620]  Pull it up, guys.
[03:04:05.620 --> 03:04:06.620]  I sent it to you two to three days ago.
[03:04:06.620 --> 03:04:07.620]  I didn't cover it.
[03:04:07.620 --> 03:04:09.620]  Pull it up.
[03:04:09.620 --> 03:04:10.620]  You need time.
[03:04:10.620 --> 03:04:11.620]  Actually, I don't even have the printout.
[03:04:11.620 --> 03:04:12.620]  Oh, here it is.
[03:04:12.620 --> 03:04:16.620]  It was on Burt Lancaster's Twitter.
[03:04:16.620 --> 03:04:17.620]  Nobody saw it coming.
[03:04:17.620 --> 03:04:19.620]  We were worried about AI or the Illiniati.
[03:04:19.620 --> 03:04:21.620]  Nobody thought the world would be taken over
[03:04:21.620 --> 03:04:24.620]  by a group of very militant Jennifer Anistons.
[03:04:24.620 --> 03:04:26.620]  We should have listened to Alex Jones

[03:04:29.620 --> 03:04:30.620]  I told you.

[03:04:32.620 --> 03:04:34.620]  that looks like a 14-year-old boy.
[03:04:34.620 --> 03:04:37.620]  No, women don't know what men want.
[03:04:37.620 --> 03:04:39.620]  I'm going to tell women what men want
[03:04:39.620 --> 03:04:41.620]  and what you want.
[03:04:41.620 --> 03:04:44.620]  We want empowered women
[03:04:44.620 --> 03:04:48.620]  because you are the fulcrum of our species.

[03:05:59.620 --> 03:06:04.620]  InfoWars
[03:06:04.620 --> 03:06:07.620]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation,
[03:06:07.620 --> 03:06:09.620]  it's Alex Jones,
[03:06:09.620 --> 03:06:13.620]  coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[03:06:26.620 --> 03:06:28.620]  All right, I'm going to hand the baton here
[03:06:28.620 --> 03:06:30.620]  to the great Kate Daly
[03:06:30.620 --> 03:06:33.620]  on this live Wednesday worldwide transmission.
[03:06:33.620 --> 03:06:37.620]  But recently they asked one of the main AI computer systems,
[03:06:37.620 --> 03:06:40.620]  what is the ultimate woman?
[03:06:40.620 --> 03:06:43.620]  And it wasn't some meth-head, heroin-chic girl
[03:06:43.620 --> 03:06:47.620]  that looks like she's 14 and all shriveled up.
[03:06:47.620 --> 03:06:49.620]  Because we all know women,
[03:06:49.620 --> 03:06:51.620]  at least men do that are around women,
[03:06:51.620 --> 03:06:53.620]  and you'll have the most gorgeous wife,
[03:06:53.620 --> 03:06:55.620]  like my wife, curves and incredible.
[03:06:55.620 --> 03:06:59.620]  She looks like the statue of Venus with arms.
[03:06:59.620 --> 03:07:01.620]  Because you know the old statue of Venus
[03:07:01.620 --> 03:07:02.620]  has the arms broke off.
[03:07:02.620 --> 03:07:03.620]  Looks like the statue of Venus.
[03:07:03.620 --> 03:07:04.620]  Perfect.
[03:07:04.620 --> 03:07:05.620]  You can't believe it.
[03:07:05.620 --> 03:07:07.620]  The thighs, the stomach, the breasts,
[03:07:07.620 --> 03:07:09.620]  the shoulders, the face, everything.
[03:07:09.620 --> 03:07:11.620]  It's made by God.
[03:07:11.620 --> 03:07:13.620]  You look at it and you cannot believe it's so perfect.
[03:07:13.620 --> 03:07:16.620]  The arches in her feet look like table legs.
[03:07:16.620 --> 03:07:18.620]  And you look at it and you go,
[03:07:18.620 --> 03:07:21.620]  I worship this because God made this.
[03:07:21.620 --> 03:07:22.620]  I don't literally worship it,
[03:07:22.620 --> 03:07:24.620]  but I worship God's creation.
[03:07:24.620 --> 03:07:25.620]  And so they asked AI,
[03:07:25.620 --> 03:07:27.620]  we'll do an overhead shot,
[03:07:27.620 --> 03:07:30.620]  what is the man's perfect woman?
[03:07:30.620 --> 03:07:34.620]  And she's got curves, she's got hips,
[03:07:34.620 --> 03:07:35.620]  she's got it all.
[03:07:35.620 --> 03:07:36.620]  Let's put it on screen for people.
[03:07:36.620 --> 03:07:40.620]  And the strangest thing is it put her in a police uniform.
[03:07:40.620 --> 03:07:43.620]  No one asked AI to do that.
[03:07:43.620 --> 03:07:46.620]  But it scooped and scraped all what men think
[03:07:46.620 --> 03:07:48.620]  is the ideal woman.
[03:07:48.620 --> 03:07:50.620]  Now the average liberal woman thinks,
[03:07:50.620 --> 03:07:53.620]  oh my God, a woman with hips, nobody wants that.
[03:07:54.620 --> 03:07:57.620]  But they wanted a woman with power,
[03:07:57.620 --> 03:07:59.620]  a woman with authority,
[03:07:59.620 --> 03:08:03.620]  a woman with thunder and lightning in her thighs,
[03:08:03.620 --> 03:08:06.620]  and just a touch of sadness in her fingers,
[03:08:06.620 --> 03:08:08.620]  to quote the high women.
[03:08:08.620 --> 03:08:10.620]  That's what all of us want.
[03:08:10.620 --> 03:08:11.620]  I love my grandmothers.
[03:08:11.620 --> 03:08:12.620]  I love my wife.
[03:08:12.620 --> 03:08:14.620]  I love my daughters.
[03:08:14.620 --> 03:08:16.620]  I want them to be empowered and incredible.
[03:08:16.620 --> 03:08:18.620]  And they're magic, we're magic.
[03:08:18.620 --> 03:08:20.620]  We're all part of the same species.
[03:08:20.620 --> 03:08:23.620]  But AI everywhere, when it shows the image
[03:08:23.620 --> 03:08:27.620]  of a perfect woman, shows the classic archetype,
[03:08:27.620 --> 03:08:29.620]  just like on cave walls,
[03:08:29.620 --> 03:08:32.620]  of what a powerful woman looks like.
[03:08:32.620 --> 03:08:34.620]  They can be brown, white, black, it doesn't matter.
[03:08:34.620 --> 03:08:37.620]  But if you show some Hollywood image of a woman,
[03:08:37.620 --> 03:08:38.620]  it's the opposite of that.
[03:08:38.620 --> 03:08:41.620]  Because they want women to be insecure about their curves.
[03:08:41.620 --> 03:08:43.620]  They want women to feel disempowered,
[03:08:43.620 --> 03:08:46.620]  that the love of men is something of assault.
[03:08:47.620 --> 03:08:49.620]  So that's why I wanted to end the show
[03:08:49.620 --> 03:08:51.620]  before I hand it over to Kate Daly,
[03:08:51.620 --> 03:08:53.620]  who's a beautiful mind in her own right,
[03:08:53.620 --> 03:08:54.620]  and a beautiful woman in her own right,
[03:08:54.620 --> 03:08:56.620]  to say this is a celebration.
[03:08:56.620 --> 03:08:58.620]  You can have drag queen story time
[03:08:58.620 --> 03:09:00.620]  with a convicted pedophile in a clown suit,
[03:09:00.620 --> 03:09:01.620]  and that's a woman.
[03:09:01.620 --> 03:09:03.620]  But then in the Gillette ads and others,
[03:09:03.620 --> 03:09:06.620]  if a man asks a beautiful woman to have a coffee with her,
[03:09:06.620 --> 03:09:07.620]  that's rape.
[03:09:07.620 --> 03:09:09.620]  No, we're supposed to talk to women.
[03:09:09.620 --> 03:09:11.620]  We're supposed to interface with each other.
[03:09:11.620 --> 03:09:12.620]  It's a lie.
[03:09:12.620 --> 03:09:15.620]  Because men and women make up the species,
[03:09:15.620 --> 03:09:17.620]  and are children of the future.
[03:09:17.620 --> 03:09:20.620]  And we should celebrate the power of women.
[03:09:20.620 --> 03:09:23.620]  And the power of women getting behind their men,
[03:09:23.620 --> 03:09:25.620]  the men behind their women,
[03:09:25.620 --> 03:09:27.620]  it scares the globalists,
[03:09:27.620 --> 03:09:31.620]  because the power of a man and woman coming together.
[03:09:33.620 --> 03:09:34.620]  What do women want?
[03:09:34.620 --> 03:09:35.620]  They want a man who's funny,
[03:09:35.620 --> 03:09:36.620]  and has courage,
[03:09:36.620 --> 03:09:37.620]  and is hardworking,
[03:09:37.620 --> 03:09:38.620]  and who is real,
[03:09:38.620 --> 03:09:39.620]  and who is dedicated.
[03:09:39.620 --> 03:09:41.620]  It doesn't matter how big his muscles are,
[03:09:41.620 --> 03:09:42.620]  though they like big broad shoulders,
[03:09:42.620 --> 03:09:43.620]  the rest of it,
[03:09:43.620 --> 03:09:46.620]  because that genetically proves this guy can defend me.
[03:09:46.620 --> 03:09:49.620]  But we want a woman that's strong,
[03:09:49.620 --> 03:09:50.620]  and powerful,
[03:09:50.620 --> 03:09:53.620]  and so the image came up as power.
[03:09:53.620 --> 03:09:54.620]  What do women want?
[03:09:54.620 --> 03:09:55.620]  Empowered women.
[03:09:55.620 --> 03:09:59.620]  They claim men want disempowered women,
[03:09:59.620 --> 03:10:02.620]  but AI scraped billions of men's comments and photos,
[03:10:02.620 --> 03:10:05.620]  and conjured up a woman with big shoulders,
[03:10:05.620 --> 03:10:06.620]  and big breasts,
[03:10:06.620 --> 03:10:07.620]  and big hips,
[03:10:07.620 --> 03:10:08.620]  and beautiful eyes,
[03:10:08.620 --> 03:10:10.620]  in a police uniform.
[03:10:10.620 --> 03:10:12.620]  The image of authority.
[03:10:13.620 --> 03:10:16.620]  Men want women that are strong.
[03:10:16.620 --> 03:10:17.620]  Not commanding them,
[03:10:17.620 --> 03:10:18.620]  not enslaving them,
[03:10:18.620 --> 03:10:21.620]  but empowering them together.
[03:10:21.620 --> 03:10:24.620]  Men want a woman to take them into the future.
[03:10:24.620 --> 03:10:26.620]  Men want a family.
[03:10:26.620 --> 03:10:30.620]  Women want a man to take them into the future.
[03:10:30.620 --> 03:10:32.620]  Pull up Schwarzenegger.
[03:10:32.620 --> 03:10:33.620]  I told you to get it ready.
[03:10:33.620 --> 03:10:34.620]  Schwarzenegger's a horrible globalist,
[03:10:34.620 --> 03:10:36.620]  but you can look at him in the 1970s.
[03:10:36.620 --> 03:10:37.620]  Women want,
[03:10:37.620 --> 03:10:38.620]  that's the image they like.
[03:10:38.620 --> 03:10:39.620]  He's strong.
[03:10:39.620 --> 03:10:40.620]  He's powerful.
[03:10:41.620 --> 03:10:42.620]  That's what,
[03:10:42.620 --> 03:10:43.620]  on the surface,
[03:10:43.620 --> 03:10:44.620]  women want.
[03:10:44.620 --> 03:10:47.620]  They don't want some emasculated twit.
[03:10:47.620 --> 03:10:48.620]  We're strong,
[03:10:48.620 --> 03:10:49.620]  ladies and gentlemen.
[03:10:49.620 --> 03:10:50.620]  We're powerful.
[03:10:50.620 --> 03:10:51.620]  So look at Schwarzenegger,
[03:10:51.620 --> 03:10:52.620]  what the women want,
[03:10:52.620 --> 03:10:53.620]  at least on the surface.
[03:10:53.620 --> 03:10:54.620]  What do men want?
[03:10:54.620 --> 03:10:55.620]  Put up the woman.
[03:10:56.800 --> 03:11:04.679]  They want that. That's gorgeous. I love. AI didn't make that. AI showed us what we
[03:11:04.679 --> 03:11:12.519]  want. AI showed us a mirror of what we demand. Look at the average woman. You can't
[03:11:12.519 --> 03:11:16.840]  tell they're a woman. Look at the average man. You can't tell they're a man. Look at Kate
[03:11:16.840 --> 03:11:20.880]  Dowling. You're like, wow, she actually fits the bill of that woman. And it's okay to
[03:11:20.880 --> 03:11:24.720]  praise her body. You know, it's okay. They tell us it's bad to praise, but you know,
[03:11:24.720 --> 03:11:31.599]  a lot of times the cover matches the inside. Then she's got the brain to match it. She's
[03:11:31.599 --> 03:11:36.000]  she's rushing there, but let's just praise it. Let's let's worship what God made. Let's
[03:11:36.000 --> 03:11:45.199]  support what God did. And let's understand who we are. So this is what men want. They
[03:11:45.199 --> 03:11:53.000]  want powerful, gorgeous women in power. Who really wants a woman, the gloveless pedophiles
[03:11:53.000 --> 03:11:57.039]  want a child they can control some seven year old, some six year old, some three year
[03:11:57.039 --> 03:12:04.720]  old. So they cause nobody wants him. A woman doesn't want these pedophiles. A man doesn't
[03:12:04.720 --> 03:12:10.800]  want something like that. But these sickos they do. They want to disempowered boy or girl.
[03:12:10.800 --> 03:12:16.240]  They can rape and hurt because it's not interactive. It's not a beautiful, powerful made by God
[03:12:16.240 --> 03:12:22.880]  woman merging with a man made by God, something incredible to make something better. I revel
[03:12:22.880 --> 03:12:28.199]  in my wife's power. I revel in my daughter's strength. I revel in how smart they are, how
[03:12:28.199 --> 03:12:34.080]  beautiful they are. And my son, the idea that we are threatened by women's power is a lie.
[03:12:34.080 --> 03:12:38.359]  The left wants to enslave women to control them. So I wanted to end the transmission
[03:12:38.359 --> 03:12:44.800]  with that. This is what men want. This is what billions of men surveyed by AI came up
[03:12:44.800 --> 03:12:53.560]  with. And I tell you, it's good. She's in charge. She's gorgeous. She's a Valkyrie.
[03:12:53.560 --> 03:12:58.720]  But what does the left show you? Some drugged out woman is the future. Syndicated talk show
[03:12:58.720 --> 03:13:07.759]  host Kate Daly takes over now. Oh, thank you. No, go on. Go on. Well, I mean, I've never
[03:13:07.759 --> 03:13:11.439]  seen you, you know, from the chest down, but you're a you're definitely a wonder woman
[03:13:11.439 --> 03:13:16.080]  type. I'm married. I'm not trying to hit on you, but no, we appreciate you, Kate. We
[03:13:16.080 --> 03:13:23.400]  want to support you, Kate. We recognize you, Kate. I so appreciate that. You're so awesome.
[03:13:23.400 --> 03:13:29.720]  Thank you. You're our future. Beautiful. That was so sweet, though. Thank you. I love how
[03:13:29.720 --> 03:13:35.279]  you describe women because I agree. I agree with you. I so agree with you on every point
[03:13:35.279 --> 03:13:41.039]  you just made that what men want is real women. What women want is real men. But they keep
[03:13:41.039 --> 03:13:45.000]  trying to sell us something completely and totally different. We want people we're challenged
[03:13:45.000 --> 03:13:49.400]  by. I mean, it's like I mean, the women I know, my grandmother's mom are like incredibly
[03:13:49.400 --> 03:13:55.599]  powerful creatures. I mean, the idea that I'm against women is a lie. They they took
[03:13:55.599 --> 03:14:03.160]  care of me. They made me. They read to me the Greek tragedies. They they built me. Yeah,
[03:14:03.160 --> 03:14:09.920]  you revere women. That's different. You revere them. So men revere women and good women
[03:14:09.920 --> 03:14:16.119]  will revere men back. Everybody wants to know the power of a man and woman that revere
[03:14:16.119 --> 03:14:23.679]  each other. That is so powerful. I mean, that is sexy. That is wild. Exactly. You know, power
[03:14:23.679 --> 03:14:29.599]  is quiet. It isn't loud and bossy and self-involved and narcissistic. But Hollywood wants to sell
[03:14:29.599 --> 03:14:33.160]  you that. Like I loved your comment about Jennifer Aniston. It's like that's they're
[03:14:33.160 --> 03:14:38.640]  trying to sell you the the this idea that women have to be marching around in combat
[03:14:38.640 --> 03:14:43.960]  boots and taking charge. Men don't want that. They don't want that. They want someone
[03:14:43.960 --> 03:14:49.160]  they can trust. They want somebody that is is lovely and sweet. But they also want somebody
[03:14:49.160 --> 03:14:54.519]  that knows what they want. But they want somebody that reveres them, too. You know, it's it's
[03:14:54.519 --> 03:14:58.880]  funny being a woman and talking about this, because I don't think too many women in radio
[03:14:58.880 --> 03:15:04.220]  and in TV will do that. I don't think they'll actually say like, hey, women need to still
[03:15:04.220 --> 03:15:10.179]  be women. And men really like that. Look at that. A.I. image Alex showed. I like that.
[03:15:10.179 --> 03:15:17.740]  Right. Because I think it's a me. I mean, honestly, that's what men like. And it's OK.
[03:15:17.740 --> 03:15:22.300]  It's not that's not bad. That's what that's what men should like. Men are still going
[03:15:22.300 --> 03:15:28.900]  to always be men. Right. And it's not a disempowered woman they like. It's not a woman tied up
[03:15:28.900 --> 03:15:35.099]  by 50 shades of gray. It's a woman strong. Right, right. And a strong woman can also
[03:15:35.099 --> 03:15:40.220]  look kind of quiet, too. At the same time, there's moments there you want somebody to
[03:15:40.220 --> 03:15:45.179]  be a partner with you, not boss you around. And that's what Hollywood sells us. They sell
[03:15:45.179 --> 03:15:50.259]  us this idea all the time that it's woman power, girl power. And it's like, what what
[03:15:50.259 --> 03:15:53.539]  is that? What is that? I want to know what that is, because you know what that means
[03:15:53.539 --> 03:15:59.300]  for them? It means a world without men. And I don't think women would like that, actually.
[03:15:59.300 --> 03:16:03.179]  I think I think it would suck. And you know how upset women are that get a guy that's a
[03:16:03.179 --> 03:16:08.300]  beta that follows them. The women can't stand it. They get some some of the opposite of
[03:16:08.300 --> 03:16:16.259]  an alpha male, that fake alpha male that abuses them. Yeah. Or some metrosexual that puts
[03:16:16.259 --> 03:16:21.539]  on more product than they do. Nobody wants that. No woman, real woman actually wants
[03:16:21.580 --> 03:16:26.220]  that either. And but that's what we're sold is like, be emotional. Cry every five seconds.
[03:16:26.220 --> 03:16:29.859]  You don't have to cry every five seconds. I don't think women actually like that. Do
[03:16:29.859 --> 03:16:34.019]  you, Alex? I mean, I don't I don't see women clamoring for that. They don't.
[03:16:35.100 --> 03:16:38.100]  Kate, I'm going to stop ranting. It's your show. I love you. Go ahead.
[03:16:39.100 --> 03:16:42.100]  Oh, you're great. Thanks. I really appreciate those kind comments, too.
[03:16:42.100 --> 03:16:45.100]  And, you know, women do like to have the door open for them.
[03:16:45.100 --> 03:16:51.100]  And women do like the idea that that guy is going to is going to take care of them,
[03:16:51.100 --> 03:16:56.100]  but not in a way that they need to be rescued, but that that's the traditional role.
[03:16:56.100 --> 03:16:58.100]  That's why women wanted to get married.
[03:16:58.100 --> 03:17:01.100]  This is why men wanted to combine power.
[03:17:01.100 --> 03:17:05.100]  We want to combine forces. It's not like a woman's week or the man's week.
[03:17:05.100 --> 03:17:07.100]  We want somebody to power up to boom.
[03:17:09.100 --> 03:17:11.100]  I know I said I was going to leave, but you're absolutely right.
[03:17:13.100 --> 03:17:19.100]  Yeah, I mean, I think that women I think women need to be more vocal about this,
[03:17:19.100 --> 03:17:22.100]  and I think that they need to stop being so damn quiet about it,
[03:17:22.100 --> 03:17:26.100]  because I think we are in a we're in a point in history where women,
[03:17:27.100 --> 03:17:32.100]  young girls are identifying as liberals so much so that I think it's close to now.
[03:17:32.100 --> 03:17:38.100]  Forty percent of all young girls go, I'm a liberal, I'm a I'm a I'm a power liberal
[03:17:38.100 --> 03:17:40.100]  or whatever, whatever term they want to say.
[03:17:40.100 --> 03:17:45.100]  A woman just wrote a book about this, and they don't even know what that means
[03:17:45.100 --> 03:17:47.100]  because I've actually interviewed young girls.
[03:17:47.100 --> 03:17:49.100]  And I've said, what does that mean to you?
[03:17:49.100 --> 03:17:52.100]  What does the word liberal mean to you or feminist mean to you?
[03:17:53.100 --> 03:17:58.100]  They don't know what it means, but they identify as it because they're told by society
[03:17:58.100 --> 03:18:01.100]  that this is what being strong and valued means.
[03:18:01.100 --> 03:18:06.100]  And actually, it doesn't really mean anything because they don't even know how to classify it.
[03:18:06.100 --> 03:18:09.100]  And what they do is they say, well, I want I want my dreams.
[03:18:09.100 --> 03:18:11.100]  You always had your dreams.
[03:18:11.100 --> 03:18:16.100]  And you know what? A good man helps a woman achieve those dreams,
[03:18:16.100 --> 03:18:18.100]  whatever those dreams are.
[03:18:18.100 --> 03:18:21.100]  But it doesn't mean that the man is cut out of the picture.
[03:18:21.100 --> 03:18:23.100]  And it doesn't mean that the man has to be weak.
[03:18:23.100 --> 03:18:26.100]  It doesn't mean that the man is non-existent or non-valued.
[03:18:26.100 --> 03:18:31.100]  And so as society, we're skipping this.
[03:18:31.100 --> 03:18:36.100]  And we're not realizing that if a good woman shores up a man, right?
[03:18:36.100 --> 03:18:38.100]  And a good man shores up a woman.
[03:18:38.100 --> 03:18:40.100]  That's what your great partnership is.
[03:18:40.100 --> 03:18:45.100]  I talk a lot about this, and I have keynote speeches on this, too,
[03:18:45.100 --> 03:18:50.100]  because I think that women need to stand up more and talk about that and say,
[03:18:50.100 --> 03:18:54.100]  you know what? There are times when I want to listen to my husband because he's my husband.
[03:18:54.100 --> 03:18:56.100]  Not because I'm being bossed around.
[03:18:56.100 --> 03:18:58.100]  Because I want to listen to him.
[03:18:58.100 --> 03:18:59.100]  I want his advice.
[03:18:59.100 --> 03:19:01.100]  I asked for his advice last night on something.
[03:19:01.100 --> 03:19:03.100]  I'm like, hey, I need your input on this.
[03:19:03.100 --> 03:19:07.100]  I'm trying to make this decision, and I need you to kind of weigh in on this.
[03:19:07.100 --> 03:19:08.100]  And you know what was awesome?
[03:19:08.100 --> 03:19:11.100]  He just kind of listened, and he was, okay, yeah, yeah.
[03:19:11.100 --> 03:19:15.100]  I interviewed somebody one time, and I said,
[03:19:15.100 --> 03:19:19.100]  can you give us the secret of marriage in like five minutes?
[03:19:19.100 --> 03:19:23.100]  Can you actually wrap that up in a bow and save marriages out there?
[03:19:23.100 --> 03:19:26.100]  And this wonderful marriage therapist said,
[03:19:26.100 --> 03:19:31.100]  yeah, men, when you get home from work, you know,
[03:19:31.100 --> 03:19:34.100]  hey, women, why don't you try to look nice a little bit?
[03:19:34.100 --> 03:19:36.100]  Because, you know, they're pretty visual creatures.
[03:19:36.100 --> 03:19:37.100]  Look nice.
[03:19:37.100 --> 03:19:38.100]  Greet them at the door.
[03:19:38.100 --> 03:19:39.100]  Be happy to see them, right?
[03:19:39.100 --> 03:19:40.100]  That's not hard, right?
[03:19:40.100 --> 03:19:42.100]  You're not giving anything up.
[03:19:42.100 --> 03:19:43.100]  It's all good.
[03:19:43.100 --> 03:19:45.100]  Be happy to see them.
[03:19:45.100 --> 03:19:47.100]  And then let them have 30 minutes on their own
[03:19:47.100 --> 03:19:52.100]  without badgering them about the kids or the dishes or dinner or anything like that.
[03:19:52.100 --> 03:19:54.100]  And just let them have some space, okay?
[03:19:54.100 --> 03:19:58.100]  And then, men, when you're done with that space for 30 minutes or so,
[03:19:58.100 --> 03:20:00.100]  then ask your wife how her day was.
[03:20:00.100 --> 03:20:01.100]  And just sit and listen.
[03:20:01.100 --> 03:20:02.100]  Don't try to solve anything.
[03:20:02.100 --> 03:20:03.100]  Just sit and listen.
[03:20:03.100 --> 03:20:06.100]  And if you want brownie points, if you know what I mean, later on,
[03:20:06.100 --> 03:20:09.100]  then you just say, you know, what else?
[03:20:09.100 --> 03:20:11.100]  What else happened in your day?
[03:20:11.100 --> 03:20:12.100]  What's going on?
[03:20:12.100 --> 03:20:13.100]  Let me know.
[03:20:13.100 --> 03:20:14.100]  Tell me.
[03:20:14.100 --> 03:20:17.100]  I just want to hear how your day was.
[03:20:17.100 --> 03:20:20.100]  That will solve more marriages than anything.
[03:20:20.100 --> 03:20:21.100]  Isn't that crazy?
[03:20:21.100 --> 03:20:22.100]  You know why?
[03:20:22.100 --> 03:20:23.100]  Because it's broken up by need.
[03:20:23.100 --> 03:20:24.100]  That's why.
[03:20:24.100 --> 03:20:27.100]  It's broken up by the needs of guys and the needs of gals,
[03:20:27.100 --> 03:20:31.100]  which has never changed, right, in centuries, okay?
[03:20:31.100 --> 03:20:35.100]  And it's okay to get to know what a man is all about and what they like
[03:20:35.100 --> 03:20:37.100]  because they're different creatures than us.
[03:20:37.100 --> 03:20:40.100]  And it's okay for men to figure out women and figure out don't solve everything,
[03:20:40.100 --> 03:20:43.100]  just listen or act like you're listening, whatever.
[03:20:43.100 --> 03:20:47.100]  Did you know when this therapist talked about that,
[03:20:47.100 --> 03:20:50.100]  I laughed because it was so stupid and simple,
[03:20:50.100 --> 03:20:52.100]  but so simple that it actually works.
[03:20:52.100 --> 03:20:54.100]  That's what's so crazy about it.
[03:20:54.100 --> 03:20:56.100]  It actually works.
[03:20:56.100 --> 03:21:01.100]  How simple is that to come home and have a wife that's not naggy
[03:21:01.100 --> 03:21:04.100]  and just wants to say hi to you and excited you're there?
[03:21:04.100 --> 03:21:08.100]  Most men would just be so excited at the thought of that, right?
[03:21:08.100 --> 03:21:11.100]  And women, how much do you want somebody to just go,
[03:21:11.100 --> 03:21:12.100]  hey, how was your day?
[03:21:12.100 --> 03:21:13.100]  Tell me everything.
[03:21:13.100 --> 03:21:16.100]  Okay, in the back of your mind, guys, I know you don't want to hear everything.
[03:21:16.100 --> 03:21:19.100]  You don't want to hear every cut and pick and detail,
[03:21:19.100 --> 03:21:24.100]  but isn't that so simple on the need factor of what men need
[03:21:24.100 --> 03:21:26.100]  versus what women need?
[03:21:26.100 --> 03:21:30.100]  And you could save marriages just by doing that on a daily basis.
[03:21:30.100 --> 03:21:33.100]  Women would feel heard, which is what we want,
[03:21:33.100 --> 03:21:35.100]  and men would get some space,
[03:21:35.100 --> 03:21:38.100]  and a woman would actually be excited to see them.
[03:21:38.400 --> 03:21:40.400]  Could you get any more simple than that?
[03:21:40.400 --> 03:21:41.400]  I don't think so.
[03:21:41.400 --> 03:21:44.400]  Anyway, I love that topic.
[03:21:44.400 --> 03:21:46.400]  I'm so glad, actually, that Alex brought that up
[03:21:46.400 --> 03:21:49.400]  because I love speaking to that topic
[03:21:49.400 --> 03:21:52.400]  because women need to just figure this out.
[03:21:52.400 --> 03:21:55.400]  We are getting sold a box of rocks
[03:21:55.400 --> 03:21:57.400]  and it's not about bossy mean power.
[03:21:57.400 --> 03:22:00.400]  In fact, I watched the first episode of Golden Bachelor, okay?
[03:22:00.400 --> 03:22:01.400]  And I'm not knocking the show.
[03:22:01.400 --> 03:22:02.400]  I mean, it's a bachelor show.
[03:22:02.400 --> 03:22:03.400]  You get what you get.
[03:22:03.400 --> 03:22:06.400]  But it was interesting to see the women on the show
[03:22:06.400 --> 03:22:08.400]  and I'm not trying to be mean at all.
[03:22:08.400 --> 03:22:09.400]  I'm really not.
[03:22:09.400 --> 03:22:11.400]  I don't like to sit and just badger women
[03:22:11.400 --> 03:22:13.400]  because it's not really fair either.
[03:22:13.400 --> 03:22:14.400]  But it was interesting.
[03:22:14.400 --> 03:22:16.400]  The guy seemed like a kind of a typical guy,
[03:22:16.400 --> 03:22:19.400]  like a guy you'd meet anywhere, right?
[03:22:19.400 --> 03:22:22.400]  And he was in a long marriage and his wife passed away
[03:22:22.400 --> 03:22:25.400]  and his story was really kind of sweet.
[03:22:25.400 --> 03:22:30.400]  And these women come in,
[03:22:30.400 --> 03:22:34.400]  like they were just literally flaunting themselves
[03:22:34.400 --> 03:22:37.400]  in the first three seconds they were meeting him.
[03:22:37.400 --> 03:22:39.400]  Basically, I swear to you,
[03:22:39.400 --> 03:22:42.400]  it was like one of those monkeys that climbs on something
[03:22:42.400 --> 03:22:44.400]  with all fours, you know?
[03:22:44.400 --> 03:22:47.400]  It's like both arms, both legs, it just clings.
[03:22:47.400 --> 03:22:48.400]  It's like that.
[03:22:48.400 --> 03:22:51.400]  And these women were just like,
[03:22:51.400 --> 03:22:53.400]  basically, I swear to you,
[03:22:53.400 --> 03:22:55.400]  it was like, let's just get on the ground and do it.
[03:22:55.400 --> 03:22:56.400]  Like, come on.
[03:22:56.400 --> 03:22:58.400]  I'm in love with you already in two seconds
[03:22:58.400 --> 03:23:01.400]  and I just, you know, here I am.
[03:23:02.400 --> 03:23:04.400]  And, you know, a woman shows up on a motorcycle
[03:23:04.400 --> 03:23:07.400]  and it's got to show this powerful woman.
[03:23:07.400 --> 03:23:09.400]  And then when they all got in the same room
[03:23:09.400 --> 03:23:10.400]  and they were waiting for the bachelor,
[03:23:10.400 --> 03:23:12.400]  it was kind of like,
[03:23:12.400 --> 03:23:16.400]  oh, I'm around the most amazing, powerful women.
[03:23:16.400 --> 03:23:18.400]  I'm like sitting there watching this going,
[03:23:18.400 --> 03:23:20.400]  that's power?
[03:23:20.400 --> 03:23:22.400]  That's what power looks like?
[03:23:22.400 --> 03:23:26.400]  I mean, they were all really willing to
[03:23:26.400 --> 03:23:28.400]  basically just give him whatever he wanted
[03:23:28.400 --> 03:23:30.400]  in the first three seconds, right?
[03:23:30.400 --> 03:23:33.400]  And I'm not saying guys wouldn't want that,
[03:23:33.400 --> 03:23:35.400]  but can we get some class back?
[03:23:35.400 --> 03:23:38.400]  Can we make it look like
[03:23:38.400 --> 03:23:40.400]  women aren't desperately looking for sex?
[03:23:40.400 --> 03:23:41.400]  Can we make it look like
[03:23:41.400 --> 03:23:44.400]  that's not showcased as power anymore?
[03:23:44.400 --> 03:23:49.400]  Because we say that we want to be taken seriously
[03:23:49.400 --> 03:23:54.400]  and then look at how we act, right?
[03:23:54.400 --> 03:23:56.400]  We're still on this kick of
[03:23:56.400 --> 03:23:59.400]  the sexualization of everything,
[03:23:59.400 --> 03:24:02.400]  but we still want you to say,
[03:24:02.400 --> 03:24:04.400]  oh, but love me for my brain.
[03:24:04.400 --> 03:24:05.400]  You know what I mean?
[03:24:05.400 --> 03:24:07.400]  So we're in this really weird dichotomy.
[03:24:07.400 --> 03:24:09.400]  But as I was watching the show,
[03:24:09.400 --> 03:24:13.400]  the women were just so desperately desperate.
[03:24:13.400 --> 03:24:15.400]  And I thought, you know what?
[03:24:15.400 --> 03:24:19.400]  Power looks like something a lot sweeter than that.
[03:24:19.400 --> 03:24:21.400]  Power is actually kind of quiet.
[03:24:21.400 --> 03:24:25.400]  Power can be a really beautiful thing,
[03:24:25.400 --> 03:24:27.400]  but it doesn't have to be loud and aggressive
[03:24:27.400 --> 03:24:30.400]  and basically flaunting yourself
[03:24:30.400 --> 03:24:32.400]  just to get some attention.
[03:24:32.400 --> 03:24:34.400]  You don't have to do that, right?
[03:24:34.400 --> 03:24:36.400]  And I was just watching that,
[03:24:36.400 --> 03:24:37.400]  and I just thought, wow,
[03:24:37.400 --> 03:24:40.400]  what are we doing as a society?
[03:24:40.400 --> 03:24:41.400]  Where are we going with this?
[03:24:41.400 --> 03:24:43.400]  Because these were all single women
[03:24:43.400 --> 03:24:45.400]  in their 60s and 70s,
[03:24:45.400 --> 03:24:46.400]  and I just thought,
[03:24:46.400 --> 03:24:48.400]  can't be a little classier?
[03:24:48.400 --> 03:24:49.400]  Come on, come on.
[03:24:49.400 --> 03:24:51.400]  You can be a little classier, right?
[03:24:51.400 --> 03:24:54.400]  Anyway, enough of that.
[03:24:54.400 --> 03:24:56.400]  It was kind of hard to watch,
[03:24:56.400 --> 03:24:57.400]  to tell you the truth.
[03:24:57.400 --> 03:24:58.400]  But the guy looks normal.
[03:24:58.400 --> 03:25:01.400]  The guy looks like he's just kind of going on.
[03:25:01.400 --> 03:25:05.400]  So I wanted to say a couple of things today.
[03:25:05.400 --> 03:25:07.400]  First of all, the emergency test.
[03:25:07.400 --> 03:25:09.400]  I want to talk about that for just a moment.
[03:25:09.400 --> 03:25:12.400]  The emergency test is kind of interesting.
[03:25:12.400 --> 03:25:13.400]  Why?
[03:25:13.400 --> 03:25:15.400]  Why are they making this big deal about it?
[03:25:15.400 --> 03:25:17.400]  Because all they had to do was just do it.
[03:25:17.400 --> 03:25:19.400]  Honestly, it says it's a test, right?
[03:25:19.400 --> 03:25:22.400]  But they wanted to kind of preface it,
[03:25:22.400 --> 03:25:23.400]  want everybody to know,
[03:25:23.400 --> 03:25:24.400]  so everybody got freaked out,
[03:25:24.400 --> 03:25:26.400]  thinking something big was going to happen today.
[03:25:26.400 --> 03:25:27.400]  But I never thought something big
[03:25:27.400 --> 03:25:28.400]  was going to happen today.
[03:25:28.400 --> 03:25:30.400]  I knew it was kind of about prepping for the future,
[03:25:30.400 --> 03:25:32.400]  whatever that means.
[03:25:32.400 --> 03:25:34.400]  But if they can send a text
[03:25:34.400 --> 03:25:36.400]  to every single phone in America,
[03:25:36.400 --> 03:25:38.400]  which they've always done emergency tests,
[03:25:38.400 --> 03:25:40.400]  and things are under the guise of emergency,
[03:25:40.400 --> 03:25:42.400]  election fraud is under the guise of emergency,
[03:25:42.400 --> 03:25:45.400]  lockdowns are under the guise of emergency, okay?
[03:25:45.400 --> 03:25:48.400]  Climate change will be under the guise of emergency
[03:25:48.400 --> 03:25:50.400]  without it actually being an emergency.
[03:25:50.400 --> 03:25:52.400]  What's interesting about this is that
[03:25:52.400 --> 03:25:55.400]  if they can send a text to every single phone now,
[03:25:55.400 --> 03:25:57.400]  which they just showcased, right?
[03:25:57.400 --> 03:25:58.400]  Even if you turned your phone off,
[03:25:58.400 --> 03:25:59.400]  you still got the messages.
[03:25:59.400 --> 03:26:00.400]  Then they can send a file.
[03:26:00.400 --> 03:26:02.400]  They can send a virus.
[03:26:02.400 --> 03:26:06.400]  They can send all kinds of things to your phone.
[03:26:06.400 --> 03:26:08.400]  So keep that in mind.
[03:26:08.400 --> 03:26:11.400]  And do they also want to flood us with emergencies
[03:26:11.400 --> 03:26:13.400]  now that they're able to do this?
[03:26:13.400 --> 03:26:18.400]  I remember in the 2020 debacle year of the fake pandemic,
[03:26:18.400 --> 03:26:21.400]  they sent out messages using the Amber Alert system
[03:26:21.400 --> 03:26:25.400]  so that when you got close to the border of your state,
[03:26:25.400 --> 03:26:27.400]  that it notified you.
[03:26:27.400 --> 03:26:30.400]  Well, I live on a border, so I was notified, right?
[03:26:30.400 --> 03:26:31.400]  You're getting close to your border,
[03:26:31.400 --> 03:26:33.400]  might not be able to leave your state.
[03:26:33.400 --> 03:26:36.400]  Boy, I feel free in America right now, right?
[03:26:36.400 --> 03:26:39.400]  So interesting that they had to do this
[03:26:39.400 --> 03:26:41.400]  to every single phone.
[03:26:41.400 --> 03:26:43.400]  Every single phone got this.
[03:26:43.400 --> 03:26:44.400]  Now, you know they have backdoors.
[03:26:44.400 --> 03:26:46.400]  You know they have these things happening
[03:26:46.400 --> 03:26:49.400]  and going on without our knowledge.
[03:26:49.400 --> 03:26:52.400]  So why did they make such a big spectacle of this?
[03:26:52.400 --> 03:26:54.400]  That's what was crazy.
[03:26:54.400 --> 03:26:57.400]  And then, of course, Russia today,
[03:26:57.400 --> 03:26:59.400]  and this is fake news,
[03:26:59.400 --> 03:27:01.400]  but it's put out by your mainstream media horse,
[03:27:01.400 --> 03:27:05.400]  is basically the fact that Russia did a whole siren thing
[03:27:05.400 --> 03:27:07.400]  with these old gas masks
[03:27:07.400 --> 03:27:09.400]  that look like they're from the 1950s,
[03:27:09.400 --> 03:27:11.400]  and they had the kids out on the lawn, just a few,
[03:27:11.400 --> 03:27:13.400]  doing this drill.
[03:27:13.400 --> 03:27:18.400]  Now, why would we be putting up articles about this?
[03:27:18.400 --> 03:27:20.400]  Why would we be doing this?
[03:27:20.400 --> 03:27:23.400]  Because it looks like Russia's ready to nuke us.
[03:27:23.400 --> 03:27:25.400]  The only nuking that would go on
[03:27:25.400 --> 03:27:28.400]  would be our intelligence agencies doing it
[03:27:28.400 --> 03:27:29.400]  and blaming it on another country.
[03:27:29.400 --> 03:27:32.400]  I don't know, kind of like Russia.
[03:27:32.400 --> 03:27:34.400]  So I thought that was kind of interesting,
[03:27:34.400 --> 03:27:36.400]  and they said chilling footage,
[03:27:36.400 --> 03:27:38.400]  even shows schoolchildren being taught
[03:27:38.400 --> 03:27:40.400]  how to correctly don gas masks
[03:27:40.400 --> 03:27:42.400]  because they're trying to prep you.
[03:27:42.400 --> 03:27:43.400]  They're trying to prep you
[03:27:43.400 --> 03:27:47.400]  if our intelligence agencies plan a false flag.
[03:27:47.400 --> 03:27:49.400]  That's basically what's going on.
[03:27:49.400 --> 03:27:52.400]  And then, of course, two shelters were used
[03:27:52.400 --> 03:27:55.400]  as part of the drill, could accommodate 36,000 people.
[03:27:55.400 --> 03:27:57.400]  They're making it look like,
[03:27:57.400 --> 03:28:00.400]  and why in the world would Russia be letting us know
[03:28:00.400 --> 03:28:02.400]  their plans every five seconds,
[03:28:02.400 --> 03:28:04.400]  but yet our mainstream media
[03:28:04.400 --> 03:28:08.400]  is consistently projecting what Russia's up to 24-7.
[03:28:08.400 --> 03:28:09.400]  Can you believe this crap?
[03:28:09.400 --> 03:28:11.400]  Anyway, such fake news.
[03:28:11.400 --> 03:28:14.400]  But remember that a month ago, at the end of August,
[03:28:15.400 --> 03:28:17.400]  FEMA announced $3 billion
[03:28:17.400 --> 03:28:20.400]  for building climate change resilience,
[03:28:20.400 --> 03:28:23.400]  key pillar of Bidenomics.
[03:28:23.400 --> 03:28:24.400]  Bidenomic.
[03:28:24.400 --> 03:28:26.400]  Anyways, bite me, omics.
[03:28:26.400 --> 03:28:27.400]  Give me a break.
[03:28:27.400 --> 03:28:30.400]  Anyways, so the Biden administration announced $3 billion,
[03:28:30.400 --> 03:28:32.400]  and you know what they said it was for?
[03:28:32.400 --> 03:28:34.400]  Planting trees in Oregon.
[03:28:34.400 --> 03:28:37.400]  Ah, planting trees in Oregon.
[03:28:37.400 --> 03:28:39.400]  You need $3 billion for that?
[03:28:39.400 --> 03:28:40.400]  Hmm.
[03:28:40.400 --> 03:28:42.400]  Anyway, $3 billion,
[03:28:42.400 --> 03:28:47.400]  building climate change resilience for FEMA.
[03:28:47.400 --> 03:28:48.400]  Hmm.
[03:28:48.400 --> 03:28:50.400]  And we get a little FEMA alert.
[03:28:50.400 --> 03:28:51.400]  Hmm.
[03:28:51.400 --> 03:28:53.400]  I'll be right back on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:28:53.400 --> 03:28:54.400]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:28:54.400 --> 03:28:56.400]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host, Kate Dally Radio.
[03:28:56.400 --> 03:28:57.400]  Bodies is back.
[03:28:57.400 --> 03:28:59.400]  The ultimate tumeric product on the market
[03:28:59.400 --> 03:29:02.400]  has returned to InfowarsStore.com
[03:29:02.400 --> 03:29:05.400]  and is now 25% off for a limited time.
[03:29:05.400 --> 03:29:07.400]  Utilized for thousands of years,
[03:29:07.400 --> 03:29:10.400]  tumeric is one of the most studied medicinal herbs today.
[03:29:10.400 --> 03:29:12.400]  Hundreds of peer-reviewed scientific articles
[03:29:12.400 --> 03:29:14.400]  are published every year on the chemistry
[03:29:14.400 --> 03:29:16.400]  and therapeutic potential of tumeric
[03:29:16.400 --> 03:29:18.400]  and its active components.
[03:29:18.400 --> 03:29:21.400]  Bodies will reduce inflammation throughout the body,
[03:29:21.400 --> 03:29:23.400]  help boost and support flexibility,
[03:29:23.400 --> 03:29:26.400]  increase mobility, assist in joint function,
[03:29:26.400 --> 03:29:29.400]  bolster your immune system, and so much more.
[03:29:29.400 --> 03:29:31.400]  Regular tumeric from the store
[03:29:31.400 --> 03:29:34.400]  contains about 1 to 5% of the active ingredient curcuminoids,
[03:29:34.400 --> 03:29:37.400]  but our super powerful extract using bodies
[03:29:37.400 --> 03:29:41.400]  contains over 95% of the active ingredients in tumeric.
[03:29:41.400 --> 03:29:44.400]  No other product can compare with this curcuminoid delivery system,
[03:29:44.400 --> 03:29:47.400]  so if you want to put the true power of tumeric to the test,
[03:29:47.400 --> 03:29:48.400]  then look no further.

[03:30:10.400 --> 03:30:13.400]  Pregnenolone levels decrease with age,
[03:30:13.400 --> 03:30:16.400]  and low levels are associated with fatigue,
[03:30:16.400 --> 03:30:19.400]  low brain function, and unhealthy aging.
[03:30:19.400 --> 03:30:23.400]  The Real Red Pill Plus also provides essential trace minerals,
[03:30:23.400 --> 03:30:27.400]  such as vitamin B12, calcium, copper, and zinc.

[03:30:56.400 --> 03:30:58.400]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years
[03:30:58.400 --> 03:31:01.400]  that our amazing, high-quality coffee has not been available,
[03:31:01.400 --> 03:31:04.400]  and that's because the prices went up too high for the raw beans,
[03:31:04.400 --> 03:31:06.400]  and the quality had gone down some.
[03:31:06.400 --> 03:31:09.400]  I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us,
[03:31:09.400 --> 03:31:12.400]  but now we have brought back the coffee,
[03:31:12.400 --> 03:31:16.400]  and it's even better from a national supplier
[03:31:16.400 --> 03:31:19.400]  that's veteran-owned and veteran-operated.
[03:31:19.400 --> 03:31:22.400]  It's powered by the company Minuteman Coffee.
[03:31:22.400 --> 03:31:26.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the best-tasting, best-smelling,
[03:31:27.400 --> 03:31:30.400]  strongest coffee that I have ever drank.

[03:31:56.400 --> 03:32:00.400]  Why do you think the globalists are desperately trying to censor everybody?
[03:32:00.400 --> 03:32:03.400]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk and everybody else?
[03:32:03.400 --> 03:32:07.400]  Because they can't get through this giant, megalomaniacal power grab
[03:32:07.400 --> 03:32:09.400]  if we're here exposing them.
[03:32:09.400 --> 03:32:11.400]  But we're not just exposing their operation.
[03:32:11.400 --> 03:32:16.400]  In my new book, we give you the solutions to build a new, better world,
[03:32:16.400 --> 03:32:19.400]  an alternative to Klaus Schwab's you-will-eat-the-bugs.
[03:32:19.400 --> 03:32:21.400]  This is the Great Awakening,
[03:32:21.400 --> 03:32:25.400]  the plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[03:32:25.400 --> 03:32:27.400]  It's a companion to my last book.
[03:32:27.400 --> 03:32:29.400]  It was a number one worldwide bestseller.
[03:32:29.400 --> 03:32:32.400]  And this book is even thicker and even more powerful.

[03:33:05.800 --> 03:33:14.840]  Back here with you on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:14.840 --> 03:33:18.880]  So happy to have you listening in today and I'm your guest host, Kate Dally from The Kate
[03:33:18.880 --> 03:33:19.880]  Dally Show.
[03:33:19.880 --> 03:33:26.240]  You can hear my daily show at katedallyradio.com and Lyndell TV, you can watch it.
[03:33:26.240 --> 03:33:32.039]  And doing this every day, it's so interesting to go back, look at the old headlines, match
[03:33:32.039 --> 03:33:37.199]  them up with what's happening right now and kind of give a perspective of, oh my gosh,
[03:33:37.199 --> 03:33:41.840]  look at where we're at and look at where we're going because I feel like we have kind of
[03:33:41.840 --> 03:33:46.279]  this ADD society where we don't even remember last week's headlines, right?
[03:33:46.279 --> 03:33:51.240]  And sometimes you have to look at all of it in context, but about a month ago when they
[03:33:51.240 --> 03:33:58.679]  came out and they said they needed $3 billion for FEMA, for what, for what?
[03:33:58.679 --> 03:34:04.279]  And then they said, this is a key pillar of Biden.
[03:34:04.279 --> 03:34:07.519]  He's like a walking cadaver, anyways, Bidenomics.
[03:34:07.519 --> 03:34:11.039]  And the selections they said competitive grants are going to help communities throughout the
[03:34:11.039 --> 03:34:15.599]  nation enhance resilience to climate change and extreme weather events.
[03:34:15.599 --> 03:34:16.599]  Are they God?
[03:34:16.599 --> 03:34:21.000]  Do they realize or do they know that they have this crystal ball that suggests that these
[03:34:21.000 --> 03:34:24.080]  extreme weather events are going to come?
[03:34:24.080 --> 03:34:25.439]  And how do they know that?
[03:34:25.439 --> 03:34:28.599]  They're trying to project it out, just like the whole thing with Russia.
[03:34:28.599 --> 03:34:32.240]  They're trying to get you to keep thinking that there are going to be extreme weather
[03:34:32.240 --> 03:34:35.359]  events from God because of climate change, right?
[03:34:35.359 --> 03:34:37.160]  So very manipulated.
[03:34:37.160 --> 03:34:42.279]  And what's interesting is, is that the president's bipartisan, you always know if it's bipartisan,
[03:34:42.279 --> 03:34:44.279]  they're all on the same side, honey.
[03:34:44.279 --> 03:34:48.820]  Anyways, infrastructure law provides FEMA nearly $7 billion to help these communities
[03:34:48.820 --> 03:34:57.039]  reduce their vulnerability to flood, hurricanes, drought and wildfires and extreme heat and
[03:34:57.039 --> 03:34:58.039]  climate-fueled hazards.
[03:34:58.039 --> 03:34:59.039]  What?
[03:34:59.039 --> 03:35:00.039]  What?
[03:35:00.039 --> 03:35:01.039]  Are you kidding?
[03:35:01.039 --> 03:35:07.599]  Anyway, I'm pretty sure that in the past, if there was a hurricane, a real one, that
[03:35:07.599 --> 03:35:08.599]  we dealt with it.
[03:35:08.599 --> 03:35:12.199]  And I'm pretty sure that if there was a flood, we dealt with that too.
[03:35:12.199 --> 03:35:14.840]  And do you need FEMA involved in everything?
[03:35:14.840 --> 03:35:20.080]  Because since what happened with Maui, they're having a tough time in all of the islands
[03:35:20.080 --> 03:35:22.960]  getting supplies and getting things still.
[03:35:22.960 --> 03:35:26.679]  Because when FEMA shows up, it screws everything up, right?
[03:35:27.320 --> 03:35:31.840]  They're getting their luxury stay in Maui, of course, at the Four Seasons, but it screws
[03:35:31.840 --> 03:35:32.840]  everybody else up.
[03:35:32.840 --> 03:35:34.439]  It screws everything else up.
[03:35:34.439 --> 03:35:37.519]  So that's something that's kind of interesting to keep your eye on too.
[03:35:37.519 --> 03:35:41.599]  Wherever FEMA goes, are they a new standing army?
[03:35:41.599 --> 03:35:46.720]  We look at them as this emergency hub, but like I said, they do screw stuff up.
[03:35:46.720 --> 03:35:51.720]  And then on the other hand, is that the new standing army at some point?
[03:35:51.720 --> 03:35:56.920]  We always think like UN troops or those kinds of things coming in, but it is an interesting
[03:35:56.920 --> 03:35:58.359]  thought, right?
[03:35:58.359 --> 03:36:06.199]  And then emergencies and weather are now gamed, projected, manipulated, created, used, right?
[03:36:06.199 --> 03:36:10.119]  To keep these people in this control state and in this power state.
[03:36:10.119 --> 03:36:12.640]  Why did we have the emergency alert today?
[03:36:12.640 --> 03:36:16.439]  So that, you know, prepare for an emergency, right?
[03:36:16.439 --> 03:36:18.199]  They want people to look crazy.
[03:36:18.199 --> 03:36:23.279]  They want people to kind of guess what this is about, because it does look a little odd
[03:36:23.279 --> 03:36:26.759]  that they have to keep doing this and that they have to do it on every cell phone.
[03:36:26.759 --> 03:36:31.080]  Okay, now you could be one of those that thinks, oh, well, that just seemed perfectly normal.
[03:36:31.080 --> 03:36:32.880]  And we need these kinds of alerts, right?
[03:36:32.880 --> 03:36:35.320]  What if a big emergency happened?
[03:36:35.320 --> 03:36:37.880]  Why have to do it federally?
[03:36:37.880 --> 03:36:38.880]  Why not the city?
[03:36:38.880 --> 03:36:39.880]  Why not the state?
[03:36:39.880 --> 03:36:43.179]  Why not just put a good old fashioned message on the TV?
[03:36:43.179 --> 03:36:47.759]  Pretty much everybody will be apprised to the situation, right?
[03:36:48.320 --> 03:36:49.320]  People can figure stuff out.
[03:36:49.320 --> 03:36:50.320]  They don't need to do this.
[03:36:50.320 --> 03:36:51.960]  They didn't need to do an alarm.
[03:36:51.960 --> 03:36:54.640]  They didn't need to make sure all the phones were synced.
[03:36:54.640 --> 03:36:57.820]  They didn't make sure they could get into every phone and every secret phone out there.
[03:36:57.820 --> 03:37:02.920]  They didn't need to make sure they could do that, but they wanted to, they did it.
[03:37:02.920 --> 03:37:05.720]  So there's definitely a reason, right?
[03:37:05.720 --> 03:37:08.679]  Or otherwise they would just do it, right?
[03:37:08.679 --> 03:37:12.400]  Without our knowledge, because they could do it that way too, if they really wanted to.
[03:37:12.400 --> 03:37:13.480]  Okay?
[03:37:13.480 --> 03:37:17.759]  So then they're saying, okay, invest in this critical infrastructure.
[03:37:17.759 --> 03:37:18.840]  We keep hearing that.
[03:37:18.840 --> 03:37:22.279]  And of course the most marginalized and vulnerable communities.
[03:37:22.279 --> 03:37:26.039]  You guys remember the Biden clips where he consistently talked about how stupid rural
[03:37:26.039 --> 03:37:32.199]  people are and how we can't seem to find the internet to vote and how dumb Hispanics are
[03:37:32.199 --> 03:37:37.039]  and how dumb black people are and how no one can actually get to the internet to vote and
[03:37:37.039 --> 03:37:42.240]  poor us and they really need the infrastructure, but they really need to hit rural areas because
[03:37:42.240 --> 03:37:48.800]  the rural areas is where we're just not connected because we're just so dumb and we just really
[03:37:48.800 --> 03:37:51.960]  need that internet connection.
[03:37:51.960 --> 03:37:57.480]  So fascinating to me because I did stories about this, about the local communities in
[03:37:57.480 --> 03:37:59.679]  each state signing bills.
[03:37:59.679 --> 03:38:03.160]  This was about like six or seven years ago, maybe five.
[03:38:03.160 --> 03:38:04.160]  I don't know.
[03:38:04.160 --> 03:38:09.359]  It's all a blur with 2020, but maybe six, six years ago where the state started bumping
[03:38:09.359 --> 03:38:13.119]  up money, bumping up money, bumping up money for rural community.
[03:38:13.119 --> 03:38:18.400]  If a rural community and the people in those communities really want internet access, they
[03:38:18.400 --> 03:38:23.359]  can do that on their own without creating a whole money run with your taxation to do
[03:38:23.359 --> 03:38:24.359]  it.
[03:38:24.359 --> 03:38:29.880]  And what I mean is, is that cities and states can be far more capable of doing this if the
[03:38:29.880 --> 03:38:34.320]  people are clamoring for it, but I'm not seeing, I'm not seeing that as much.
[03:38:34.320 --> 03:38:38.240]  I was seeing that the government's clamoring for it for a reason.
[03:38:38.240 --> 03:38:39.599]  Does that make sense?
[03:38:39.599 --> 03:38:46.439]  So they're consistently telling you how vulnerable and marginalized everybody is from Hispanics
[03:38:46.439 --> 03:38:52.080]  to blacks to white folk in the rural areas, and they have to make sure that we're all
[03:38:52.080 --> 03:38:53.080]  connected.
[03:38:53.080 --> 03:38:56.160]  That sounds very smart city-ish, doesn't it?
[03:38:56.160 --> 03:39:01.920]  It sounds very strange that they keep talking about this as if they care.
[03:39:01.920 --> 03:39:03.560]  They don't care.
[03:39:03.560 --> 03:39:05.080]  Come election time, what do they care about?
[03:39:05.080 --> 03:39:06.080]  The big cities, right?
[03:39:06.080 --> 03:39:08.119]  They don't care about the rural areas.
[03:39:08.119 --> 03:39:10.560]  But all of a sudden, they care about it, okay?
[03:39:10.560 --> 03:39:15.240]  So then they went on to talk about 10,000 trees within the next three years in Portland,
[03:39:15.240 --> 03:39:16.240]  Oregon.
[03:39:16.240 --> 03:39:17.240]  Of course, they can go to Portland.
[03:39:17.240 --> 03:39:18.960]  It's completely woke now and trashed.
[03:39:18.960 --> 03:39:24.199]  But to reduce extreme heat conditions, okay, you have all these really weird things.
[03:39:24.199 --> 03:39:29.400]  You guys remember Dr. Haku or Kaku, I can't remember how to say his name.
[03:39:29.400 --> 03:39:33.160]  I'm the name-murderer, so whatever, said that the government can control the weather.
[03:39:33.160 --> 03:39:37.560]  He went on TV and he said that, I don't see him invited anymore to be on TV, do you?
[03:39:37.560 --> 03:39:41.519]  But he said that eight states practice some form of weather modification, and this was
[03:39:41.519 --> 03:39:43.439]  like 15 years ago.
[03:39:43.439 --> 03:39:48.480]  He gave a number of examples, including Operation Popeye, the secret program in Vietnam to seed
[03:39:48.480 --> 03:39:55.439]  the clouds with silver iodide crystals to accelerate the monsoon season and wash the
[03:39:55.439 --> 03:39:56.759]  Viet Cong away.
[03:39:56.759 --> 03:40:01.119]  2008, during the Olympics, China seeded the clouds in order to have it rain outside of
[03:40:01.119 --> 03:40:02.279]  the Olympics.
[03:40:02.279 --> 03:40:06.759]  Many countries have weather modification programs, the economy, trade war, everything
[03:40:06.759 --> 03:40:08.840]  else is dependent on the weather.
[03:40:08.840 --> 03:40:12.759]  We've had treaties signed since the 1970s that I've mentioned on the show about the
[03:40:12.759 --> 03:40:16.560]  fact that if we're going to sign a treaty, you can't manipulate the weather.
[03:40:16.560 --> 03:40:18.920]  And then they want to say it's a theory, right?
[03:40:18.920 --> 03:40:21.080]  You're a conspiracy theorist.
[03:40:21.080 --> 03:40:22.920]  No, I'm not.
[03:40:22.920 --> 03:40:29.039]  I'm just not a, I don't find that everything is just, ooh, what a coincidence, coincidence
[03:40:29.039 --> 03:40:30.039]  theorism.
[03:40:30.039 --> 03:40:35.519]  Anyway, so he talked about this, the U.S. experimenting with trillion-watt lasers that
[03:40:35.519 --> 03:40:44.080]  are pulsed, Maui, anyway, California fires, anyway, and produce more energy in a split
[03:40:44.080 --> 03:40:47.400]  second than that of all nuclear energy plants on earth.
[03:40:47.400 --> 03:40:52.660]  And it's only lasts for a brief period of time and raindrops can be created.
[03:40:52.660 --> 03:40:59.519]  And then when Texas came around to their major hurricane, I remember the government of Texas
[03:40:59.519 --> 03:41:04.800]  were on TV saying, oh yeah, we can completely like manipulate and we can make things stronger
[03:41:05.080 --> 03:41:09.800]  and we can take a weather, something in the weather and actually make it stronger.
[03:41:09.800 --> 03:41:12.160]  So we've known this for years, right?
[03:41:12.160 --> 03:41:13.840]  We're going to see more and more emergencies.
[03:41:13.840 --> 03:41:18.119]  I think they want to flood us with emergencies, put us in a constant, like we're not right
[03:41:18.119 --> 03:41:23.320]  now with fear porn, but put us in a constant state of, oh my gosh, we're falling apart.
[03:41:23.320 --> 03:41:26.439]  Oh my gosh, we're falling apart, right?
[03:41:26.439 --> 03:41:28.320]  Same thing with the whole McCarthy thing.
[03:41:28.320 --> 03:41:29.880]  I think this is two things.
[03:41:29.880 --> 03:41:34.920]  I think number one, they do want to create some chaos, but they also want to make it
[03:41:34.920 --> 03:41:38.320]  look like they're cleaning stuff up on the right because I think they're moving us more
[03:41:38.320 --> 03:41:39.320]  to the right.
[03:41:39.320 --> 03:41:41.960]  Actually, they moved us to the left with Obama.
[03:41:41.960 --> 03:41:43.560]  Now they're going to move us to the right.
[03:41:43.560 --> 03:41:49.480]  And this is why you get to see all of the cadaver Biden, the walking cadaver moments.
[03:41:49.480 --> 03:41:51.960]  Otherwise they'd conceal those moments.
[03:41:51.960 --> 03:41:53.920]  They would conceal them, okay?
[03:41:53.920 --> 03:41:55.480]  They want you to see them.
[03:41:55.480 --> 03:41:59.000]  They want you to see that he's got documents in his garage and no one's going after him.
[03:41:59.119 --> 03:42:03.119]  They want you to see that he can't fulfill a sentence and that he looks like a total
[03:42:03.119 --> 03:42:04.279]  walking moron.
[03:42:04.279 --> 03:42:06.720]  They want you to see that he's inept.
[03:42:06.720 --> 03:42:08.560]  They want you to see it.
[03:42:08.560 --> 03:42:11.560]  So why do they want you to see it?
[03:42:11.560 --> 03:42:15.599]  Now it looks like we're cleaning up the right, which is kind of interesting.
[03:42:15.599 --> 03:42:22.840]  Matt Gaetz actually has a pretty good constitutional lifetime score, average of 84%, it's not bad.
[03:42:22.840 --> 03:42:29.199]  And it's kind of interesting that, you know, he's the one kind of in charge of the McCarthy
[03:42:29.199 --> 03:42:30.199]  thing.
[03:42:30.199 --> 03:42:32.240]  Now McCarthy, I think, is bought and sold.
[03:42:32.240 --> 03:42:34.160]  Most of them are, okay?
[03:42:34.160 --> 03:42:36.960]  And so sacrificial lamb a little?
[03:42:36.960 --> 03:42:37.960]  Yeah, okay.
[03:42:37.960 --> 03:42:39.679]  Can Trump be speaker?
[03:42:39.679 --> 03:42:41.119]  Trump offered himself up as speaker.
[03:42:41.119 --> 03:42:42.439]  That's kind of an interesting note.
[03:42:42.439 --> 03:42:44.439]  Talk about that in a second.
[03:42:44.439 --> 03:42:45.920]  But I just, it's kind of interesting.
[03:42:45.920 --> 03:42:52.679]  I think it's a, I think it's a move to the right cleaned up sign to get us to trust again.
[03:42:53.679 --> 03:42:55.119]  Which, they'll fall short.
[03:42:55.119 --> 03:42:57.039]  Be right back on the Alex Jones.
[03:42:57.039 --> 03:43:01.560]  Where were you when humanity was fighting for its life?
[03:43:01.560 --> 03:43:05.400]  Where were you when the globalists were caught trafficking millions of children for sex slavery
[03:43:05.400 --> 03:43:06.720]  worldwide?
[03:43:06.720 --> 03:43:09.759]  Where were you when the new world order was starting, World War III with Russia?
[03:43:09.759 --> 03:43:11.199]  Well, I know where you are.

[03:43:27.240 --> 03:43:29.320]  the next great renaissance.
[03:43:29.320 --> 03:43:32.960]  This is my second book, part two of The Great Recent and The War for the World.
[03:43:32.960 --> 03:43:36.580]  It's a longer book, quite frankly, a more powerful book.

[03:44:04.599 --> 03:44:09.800]  Concentrated chicken broth, patented amazing, then a huge dose of chaga mushroom, a massive
[03:44:09.800 --> 03:44:15.720]  dose of beet pollen, a gigantic dose of highest quality turmeric, and then it just gets crazier
[03:44:15.720 --> 03:44:16.880]  from there.

[03:45:00.400 --> 03:45:04.080]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk, everybody else?
[03:45:04.080 --> 03:45:08.320]  Because they can't get through this giant, megalomaniacal power grab if we're here exposing
[03:45:08.320 --> 03:45:09.320]  them.
[03:45:09.320 --> 03:45:11.480]  But we're not just exposing their operation.

[03:46:57.800 --> 03:47:03.920]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:05.400 --> 03:47:13.080]  I'm back here with you on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:13.080 --> 03:47:14.240]  I'm glad you're tuned in.
[03:47:14.240 --> 03:47:18.600]  Man, we've got to get rid of all the noise out there, don't we?
[03:47:18.600 --> 03:47:23.000]  There's so much to talk about, but I just love that you're tuned in, because you know
[03:47:23.000 --> 03:47:24.000]  what it means?
[03:47:24.000 --> 03:47:29.119]  It means that you love this country, you care about this country, and you want it back,
[03:47:29.119 --> 03:47:35.199]  and I'm going to talk about that in just a second, but when I say that this is such
[03:47:35.199 --> 03:47:42.680]  theater all the time, back in February, speaking to the ADD of Americans, once again, I mean,
[03:47:42.680 --> 03:47:44.680]  it's really our flaw, is it not?
[03:47:44.680 --> 03:47:48.520]  It's hard to see stuff in context, and it's hard because we're so brainwashed by the media.
[03:47:48.520 --> 03:47:55.119]  I mean, if you knew how much money that was spent on you to brainwash you, you would feel
[03:47:55.119 --> 03:47:56.119]  super special.
[03:47:56.119 --> 03:47:59.119]  I'm just saying.
[03:47:59.119 --> 03:48:00.320]  You'd feel really good about yourself.
[03:48:00.320 --> 03:48:03.680]  Yeah, they spend an awful lot of money and time to brainwash you.
[03:48:03.680 --> 03:48:10.720]  So back in February, remember that House Speaker Kevin McCarthy quietly appointed Representative
[03:48:10.720 --> 03:48:17.160]  Matt Gaetz, who led the unsuccessful push to derail his bid for Speaker, to the Select
[03:48:17.160 --> 03:48:21.279]  Committee investigating the so-called weaponization of the federal government.
[03:48:21.279 --> 03:48:28.760]  Okay, this is a piece written in probably the scumbags at AP, but there's no announcement
[03:48:28.760 --> 03:48:33.000]  of Gaetz's appointment by McCarthy, like they didn't put it out there.
[03:48:33.320 --> 03:48:38.199]  And so the reporters noticed it when it was read into the congressional record.
[03:48:38.199 --> 03:48:39.880]  So do you think they're enemies?
[03:48:39.880 --> 03:48:42.480]  Let me put it this way.
[03:48:42.480 --> 03:48:48.000]  Do you think that all the people that get the committee assignments, do you think they're
[03:48:48.000 --> 03:48:51.100]  really fighting for this country?
[03:48:51.100 --> 03:48:56.080]  Because usually when you get a committee assignment, okay, that doesn't mean good things.
[03:48:56.080 --> 03:48:59.680]  It means that they can work with you.
[03:48:59.680 --> 03:49:02.880]  You are a person they like.
[03:49:02.880 --> 03:49:10.400]  You're in the club, and we'll keep you around through the dollars going in and flooding
[03:49:10.400 --> 03:49:11.400]  the party.
[03:49:11.400 --> 03:49:12.560]  That's what it means to me.
[03:49:12.560 --> 03:49:17.320]  So when I say they're all on the same side, well, there you go.
[03:49:17.320 --> 03:49:18.600]  What can I say?
[03:49:18.600 --> 03:49:22.160]  To me, they're all on the same side, and that's a whole lot of theater being played out.
[03:49:22.160 --> 03:49:24.640]  That's why I say they're moving us to the right.
[03:49:24.640 --> 03:49:29.240]  And when they move us to the right, it usually means that we get way more money in the war
[03:49:29.240 --> 03:49:30.240]  budgets.
[03:49:30.279 --> 03:49:34.400]  Now it's gone up every single year, and even when Trump was in, man, it really flooded
[03:49:34.400 --> 03:49:36.800]  when Trump was in that amount.
[03:49:36.800 --> 03:49:39.760]  So it doesn't mean you're going to get a break from any of that.
[03:49:39.760 --> 03:49:44.680]  What they're trying to do is move us to the right to get the most of the country into
[03:49:44.680 --> 03:49:49.160]  a position where we think we're going to get our country back.
[03:49:49.160 --> 03:49:50.840]  They're cleaning up house.
[03:49:50.840 --> 03:49:54.000]  They're doing what they need to do superficially.
[03:49:54.000 --> 03:49:56.840]  But then they increase war budgets.
[03:49:56.840 --> 03:49:59.840]  So probably something on that front is about to happen.
[03:50:00.440 --> 03:50:01.440]  It'll be a false flag.
[03:50:01.440 --> 03:50:03.680]  It'll be manipulated, whatever it is.
[03:50:03.680 --> 03:50:04.680]  Because you know what?
[03:50:04.680 --> 03:50:13.160]  This natural occurrence thing, it's so strange to me, but they're manipulating way too much.
[03:50:13.160 --> 03:50:14.160]  And we know it.
[03:50:14.160 --> 03:50:15.160]  You know it.
[03:50:15.160 --> 03:50:16.160]  I don't even have to explain it.
[03:50:16.160 --> 03:50:17.640]  There was a great piece.
[03:50:17.640 --> 03:50:24.720]  There was a great piece at Fee actually by Patrick Carroll, and he talked about the four
[03:50:24.720 --> 03:50:29.400]  differences between the freedom brand and the freedom philosophy.
[03:50:29.400 --> 03:50:31.440]  I call it freedom theory.
[03:50:31.440 --> 03:50:35.359]  And what's interesting is if you ask the average American what they think about freedom or
[03:50:35.359 --> 03:50:38.000]  liberty, chances are you'll get a pretty positive response.
[03:50:38.000 --> 03:50:41.440]  Everybody wants to think that they're all in for liberty, right?
[03:50:41.440 --> 03:50:46.920]  A love of liberty built into the cultural fabric of America, okay?
[03:50:46.920 --> 03:50:49.760]  And of course, we pride ourselves on being land of the free, right?
[03:50:49.760 --> 03:50:54.560]  We get a little teary eyed, and the military flies over a game, and the veterans walk down
[03:50:54.560 --> 03:50:57.880]  the middle of the street, and they struggle to do it.
[03:50:57.880 --> 03:51:01.520]  And you get a tear in your eye because you should, you know?
[03:51:01.520 --> 03:51:04.480]  People really have sacrificed for this country.
[03:51:04.480 --> 03:51:08.240]  They actually really have done some wonderful things, okay?
[03:51:08.240 --> 03:51:12.880]  But it also begs this question too, if we're so passionate about freedom, if we all get
[03:51:12.880 --> 03:51:19.000]  a little choked up, if, I wouldn't say all, but the majority, if the majority of America
[03:51:19.000 --> 03:51:23.960]  is conservative, which they are, and on that note, you have to ask yourself, so then why
[03:51:23.960 --> 03:51:26.359]  are we not winning every single race?
[03:51:26.400 --> 03:51:32.460]  Somebody might be monkeying the numbers a little.
[03:51:32.460 --> 03:51:35.960]  The majority of America is conservative.
[03:51:35.960 --> 03:51:42.080]  So here's the deal, I mean, if we're so passionate about freedom, why are we allowing
[03:51:42.080 --> 03:51:43.119]  all of this stuff?
[03:51:43.119 --> 03:51:48.199]  Why are we saying that it's totally fine for Department of Homeland Security to now
[03:51:48.199 --> 03:51:53.400]  involve themselves in retail theft at Target?
[03:51:53.400 --> 03:51:56.080]  And you know it has nothing to do with retail theft.
[03:51:56.080 --> 03:52:00.520]  It means that they're just putting in a lot more spying apparatus, right?
[03:52:00.520 --> 03:52:03.039]  Facial recognition, things like that, okay?
[03:52:03.039 --> 03:52:06.640]  And they're saying that, well, you know, we're partnering.
[03:52:06.640 --> 03:52:10.560]  And these public-private partnerships that are going to be the death of America and are
[03:52:10.560 --> 03:52:12.279]  the death of America.
[03:52:12.279 --> 03:52:19.920]  But what's interesting is we have this sort of strange dichotomy going on in America.
[03:52:19.920 --> 03:52:21.660]  And there's two ways of understanding freedom.
[03:52:21.660 --> 03:52:25.680]  There's the freedom brand and then there's also the freedom philosophy.
[03:52:25.680 --> 03:52:28.680]  And for most Americans, what they really like is the freedom brand.
[03:52:28.680 --> 03:52:31.440]  It's the general idea of freedom, okay?
[03:52:31.440 --> 03:52:33.440]  They like to think, well, we're free.
[03:52:33.440 --> 03:52:35.960]  I mean, of course we're free, we're American.
[03:52:35.960 --> 03:52:40.160]  And then the emotion starts and we get into the emotion of it, which makes us feel warm
[03:52:40.160 --> 03:52:41.160]  and cozy.
[03:52:41.160 --> 03:52:44.480]  It's supposed to, it's emotion, that's how it works.
[03:52:44.480 --> 03:52:48.420]  But to understand the distinction of this, you look at four different things, principles
[03:52:48.420 --> 03:52:50.680]  versus preferences.
[03:52:50.680 --> 03:52:55.199]  This is such great information, really, because we really need to analyze ourselves.
[03:52:55.199 --> 03:53:00.880]  What do we really want and what are we really wanting to actually fight for, okay?
[03:53:00.880 --> 03:53:03.760]  I don't see a lot of people fighting for these things.
[03:53:03.760 --> 03:53:08.199]  I see a lot of people say them and I see a lot of people feel them, but I don't know that
[03:53:08.199 --> 03:53:10.119]  we're fighting for it.
[03:53:10.119 --> 03:53:14.760]  And the biggest difference between the freedom brand and the freedom philosophy is that the
[03:53:14.760 --> 03:53:18.640]  brand is not rigorously principled the way the philosophy is.
[03:53:18.640 --> 03:53:22.720]  For the brand, as long as you agree with a few basic ideas like free speech and free
[03:53:22.720 --> 03:53:25.480]  and fair elections, we all go, I want a free and fair election.
[03:53:25.480 --> 03:53:29.720]  I mean, because you can't be the guy that goes, I would like my elections manipulated,
[03:53:29.720 --> 03:53:30.720]  please.
[03:53:30.720 --> 03:53:33.880]  I mean, you sound like a total toad, right?
[03:53:33.880 --> 03:53:38.039]  So you have to say, well, I believe in free and fair elections.
[03:53:38.039 --> 03:53:40.240]  But it's a preference.
[03:53:40.240 --> 03:53:44.039]  Unless you're willing to do the homework and the research to go, well, are they free and
[03:53:44.039 --> 03:53:46.240]  fair?
[03:53:46.240 --> 03:53:49.199]  Or do we have Albert sensors in all of our computers?
[03:53:49.199 --> 03:53:50.680]  Are we all hooked up to the internet?
[03:53:50.680 --> 03:53:55.359]  So of course they can finagle whatever numbers they want all the way down to city races.
[03:53:55.359 --> 03:53:56.480]  And yeah, they can.
[03:53:56.480 --> 03:53:58.140]  And yeah, they do.
[03:53:58.140 --> 03:54:03.800]  So you say you want a free and fair election, but if you're a CNN watcher, you're afraid
[03:54:03.800 --> 03:54:06.539]  to do any homework because of what you might find.
[03:54:06.539 --> 03:54:07.640]  So it just sounds really nice.
[03:54:07.640 --> 03:54:09.160]  Like you give yourself a pat on the back.
[03:54:09.160 --> 03:54:12.279]  Well, I'm a free and fair election guy.
[03:54:12.279 --> 03:54:16.900]  Got my ponytail, got my Prius and I believe in democracy.
[03:54:16.900 --> 03:54:20.260]  But sir, we're a Republic.
[03:54:20.260 --> 03:54:26.820]  So we have this on the left, this weird notion that we like freedom and on the right sometimes
[03:54:26.820 --> 03:54:31.580]  do the same thing in Rhino America, Republican in name only.
[03:54:31.580 --> 03:54:36.460]  And then the majority of people, we kind of like the idea of freedom.
[03:54:36.460 --> 03:54:38.520]  But then what are we willing to fight for?
[03:54:38.520 --> 03:54:42.180]  What are we actually willing to do about it?
[03:54:42.180 --> 03:54:46.060]  And it's number two, what we're against and what we're for.
[03:54:46.220 --> 03:54:50.420]  So another difference in the freedom brand, it defines itself by what it's against, whereas
[03:54:50.420 --> 03:54:55.779]  the freedom philosophy tends to focus on what it's for.
[03:54:55.779 --> 03:55:00.340]  This is why when you look at the records of people, and I brought up Matt Gaetz, 86%,
[03:55:00.340 --> 03:55:03.699]  pretty good, but that's his votes.
[03:55:03.699 --> 03:55:08.300]  What are people in Congress, and I'm not picking on Matt, but what are people in Congress and
[03:55:08.300 --> 03:55:10.020]  the Senate actually for?
[03:55:10.020 --> 03:55:16.859]  What are they doing to put out anything that would actually get freedom back, that would
[03:55:16.859 --> 03:55:18.340]  actually get liberty back?
[03:55:18.340 --> 03:55:20.740]  Because liberty is freedom with morals.
[03:55:20.740 --> 03:55:24.020]  So what are we doing to get liberty back?
[03:55:24.020 --> 03:55:30.859]  So you could have a voting record and this is what you're against, but what are you for?
[03:55:30.859 --> 03:55:36.539]  And you could say, well, I voted for or against on somebody else's bill, but when you look
[03:55:36.539 --> 03:55:41.859]  at the records, that score doesn't actually show what they went out of their comfort
[03:55:41.859 --> 03:55:44.820]  zone to actually stand for and construct.
[03:55:44.820 --> 03:55:49.020]  Not a think tank behind the White House, but actually them.
[03:55:49.020 --> 03:55:50.580]  What are they actually for?
[03:55:50.580 --> 03:55:52.500]  What are they actually doing?
[03:55:52.500 --> 03:55:56.220]  And there's not a long list on any congressman.
[03:55:56.220 --> 03:56:02.660]  The congressmen in my state are pathetic, I mean, beyond pathetic, the state of Utah.
[03:56:02.699 --> 03:56:07.500]  And they were in the state of California where I came from too, where I was raised.
[03:56:07.500 --> 03:56:11.380]  It's pathetic because they can't sit there on a whole mountain of things that they actually
[03:56:11.380 --> 03:56:13.740]  did because why don't they do anything?
[03:56:13.740 --> 03:56:16.020]  Why aren't we seeing what they're for, right?
[03:56:16.020 --> 03:56:18.020]  It's because they say, well, I can't get any support.
[03:56:18.020 --> 03:56:21.340]  I don't care, do it anyway.
[03:56:21.340 --> 03:56:27.220]  Make it look like you care about doing something that would be what you're for, but we the people
[03:56:27.220 --> 03:56:28.420]  don't really get into this.
[03:56:28.420 --> 03:56:33.619]  We the people don't actually talk about what we're willing to do for what we're for.
[03:56:33.619 --> 03:56:36.060]  And we'll say what we're against, but what are we for?
[03:56:36.060 --> 03:56:39.820]  Slogans versus substance, land of the free, home of the brave.
[03:56:39.820 --> 03:56:40.820]  Don't tread on me.
[03:56:40.820 --> 03:56:43.660]  I'm proud to be an American where at least I know I'm free.
[03:56:43.660 --> 03:56:45.060]  But how free are we?
[03:56:45.060 --> 03:56:50.539]  We're being spied on every turn where, I mean, they're inching it, inching it, inching it.
[03:56:50.539 --> 03:56:54.619]  On that kidnapping story, I'm so glad that little girl is safe and she was found.
[03:56:54.619 --> 03:56:56.980]  But what did Hochul concentrate on?
[03:56:56.980 --> 03:57:03.580]  The means by which they captured the guy was straight up spyware.
[03:57:03.580 --> 03:57:07.619]  And we're supposed to be okay because it captures the bad guy.
[03:57:07.619 --> 03:57:10.580]  So we can't be okay with that, okay?
[03:57:10.580 --> 03:57:14.140]  And they could have done other things to get the bad guy, but they wanted to showcase their
[03:57:14.140 --> 03:57:16.699]  capability in spyware, okay?
[03:57:16.699 --> 03:57:20.100]  And then get you to accept it because they got the bad guy, of course.
[03:57:20.100 --> 03:57:21.100]  I could go on and on.
[03:57:21.100 --> 03:57:25.340]  I'll probably continue a little bit more on next Wednesday, but there's so much here to
[03:57:25.340 --> 03:57:30.220]  unpack and take a good, long look at ourselves and what we're doing, right?
[03:57:30.220 --> 03:57:31.220]  Is it the brand?
[03:57:31.220 --> 03:57:32.660]  Do we really believe it?
[03:57:32.660 --> 03:57:34.420]  Is it freedom theory?
[03:57:34.420 --> 03:57:36.380]  Or do we really, truly believe in freedom?
[03:57:36.380 --> 03:57:38.980]  Let's get our American on, huh?
[03:57:38.980 --> 03:57:45.699]  Thanks for listening to The Alex Jones Show, I'm Kate Daly, that's it for the day.
[03:57:45.699 --> 03:57:50.779]  We have not had this many of our best-selling products back in stock in years because of
[03:57:50.779 --> 03:57:53.980]  supply chain breakdowns and all the rest of the stuff that's going on.
[03:57:53.980 --> 03:57:55.420]  And these are game-changing products.
[03:57:55.420 --> 03:57:57.300]  It's like our information's game-changing.
[03:57:57.300 --> 03:57:58.820]  These products are incredible.
[03:57:58.820 --> 03:58:03.300]  And I'm personally glad that these are now back in stock.
[03:58:03.300 --> 03:58:08.080]  All three of the InfoWars Platinum flagship products that have been sold out for months
[03:58:08.080 --> 03:58:15.100]  are now back in stock, but a very limited run because we only had a budget to get three
[03:58:15.100 --> 03:58:17.380]  or 4,000 bottles of each one of these.
[03:58:17.380 --> 03:58:23.020]  I think we've got 4,000 bottles of the HGH Max Boost that people love so much.
[03:58:23.060 --> 03:58:26.940]  We've got about 4,000 bottles of 1776 Testosterone Boost that just came in.
[03:58:26.940 --> 03:58:34.420]  And we've got about 3,000 bottles of PainMD, an incredible natural pain reliever situation.
[03:58:34.420 --> 03:58:38.660]  All three of these are back in stock, and they're incredible, and they fund our operation
[03:58:38.660 --> 03:58:45.859]  at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:58:45.859 --> 03:58:47.580]  The globalists are only humans.
[03:58:47.580 --> 03:58:51.300]  Yeah, they have control of the central banks, they have a lot of power, but they can be
[03:58:51.300 --> 03:58:52.300]  defeated.
[03:58:52.300 --> 03:58:55.300]  And some of their operations are going to take decades to stop.
[03:58:55.300 --> 03:58:59.420]  But one thing you can do right now is take control of your body and your family's body
[03:58:59.420 --> 03:59:03.500]  by purifying the water that you drink and that you cook with.
[03:59:03.500 --> 03:59:07.100]  And you do it with the highest quality gravity-fed filter out there.
[03:59:07.100 --> 03:59:09.300]  This thing does 10,000 gallons.
[03:59:09.300 --> 03:59:11.980]  You can sit there and put hundreds of gallons through it a day.
[03:59:11.980 --> 03:59:16.220]  It purifies very quickly, and it cuts out thousands of chemicals to non-detectable levels.
[03:59:16.220 --> 03:59:18.580]  This is what I use, which my family uses.
[03:59:18.580 --> 03:59:22.220]  It's the very best system out there for the lowest price, for a limited time, 10% off
[03:59:22.220 --> 03:59:28.420]  on top of that, exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com on the Alexa Pure Water Filtration System
[03:59:28.420 --> 03:59:31.859]  in stock, and replacement filters for folks that need those in stock.
[03:59:31.859 --> 03:59:34.420]  Get it today, and it funds the InfoWar.
[03:59:34.420 --> 03:59:35.420]  Don't procrastinate.
[03:59:35.420 --> 03:59:39.220]  This is one of the main areas we can take control of our lives and stop the globalists from
[03:59:39.220 --> 03:59:41.859]  hitting us with poison that they allow in the water supply.
[03:59:41.859 --> 03:59:49.180]  In some cases, they add to the water supply like fluoride.
[03:59:49.180 --> 03:59:53.180]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
