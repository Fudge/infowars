[00:00.000 --> 00:20.400]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20.400 --> 00:34.900]  We will be hearing from Alex live shortly as he has to get into the news right now that's
[00:34.900 --> 00:43.680]  breaking with McCabe wanting immunity for his testimony where he's saying, whatever
[00:43.680 --> 00:51.440]  I say in this testimony, let's say it's about spy gate, whatever names or activities and
[00:51.440 --> 00:56.000]  everything he says cannot be used against him.
[00:56.000 --> 00:59.920]  So he wants immunity in his testimony.
[00:59.920 --> 01:07.320]  You also have the Justice Department about to show classified materials on the FBI source
[01:07.320 --> 01:15.360]  or sources that were inside the Trump campaign that we just were made privy to via newly
[01:15.360 --> 01:23.040]  redacted text messages, Oconus lures that's outside contiguous United States spies within
[01:23.040 --> 01:24.560]  the Trump campaign.
[01:24.560 --> 01:27.240]  Alex Jones joins me now to help break this all down.
[01:27.240 --> 01:32.800]  Alex, the deep state and Mueller's team is really in trouble right now and I think that
[01:32.800 --> 01:37.840]  there's multiple signs that they have nothing, for example, requesting to sell phones, threatening
[01:37.840 --> 01:42.040]  Manafort with prison, they've got nothing, Alex, and they're about to be exposed.
[01:42.040 --> 01:43.760]  What do they do next?
[01:43.760 --> 01:49.600]  This is ultra massive, the history that we are witnessing right now is so incredible.
[01:49.600 --> 01:53.000]  That's exactly why I'm here on the broadcast with you until the bottom of the hour.
[01:53.000 --> 01:58.480]  We're going to lay it all out chronologically because, again, they're hoping we're like goldfish.
[01:58.480 --> 01:59.800]  We have no memory.
[01:59.800 --> 02:05.960]  Everything they do, in the words of one of Obama's top advisors, and we go back to remembering
[02:05.960 --> 02:10.040]  that Jonathan Gruber is having no memory.
[02:10.040 --> 02:13.000]  They bet everything on us having no memory.
[02:13.000 --> 02:20.360]  We're going to have a memory after the break and just chronologically walk through exactly
[02:20.360 --> 02:25.760]  everything that's happened on record, but just recapping the recent developments.
[02:25.760 --> 02:33.920]  We have the new 500 pages of text messages that came out where they have the FBI slash
[02:33.920 --> 02:43.560]  CIA term for these outside the continental United States lures going into plant breadcrumbs
[02:43.560 --> 02:44.560]  2015.
[02:44.560 --> 02:49.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we got NSA database documents that they admitted were real.
[02:49.000 --> 02:54.400]  I know they even considered trying to prosecute whoever gave them to us.
[02:54.400 --> 02:59.640]  Of Trump, myself, and others being spied on, year one when Obama got into office, they've
[02:59.640 --> 03:03.120]  known full well what Trump's been planning this American take back.
[03:03.120 --> 03:04.120]  They know he's pure Americana.
[03:04.120 --> 03:07.120]  Look at everything he's doing to every other nation in the world.
[03:07.120 --> 03:09.120]  He's totally dominating everything to the U.S.
[03:09.120 --> 03:11.320]  The U.S. is totally turning around.
[03:11.320 --> 03:12.320]  America's back.
[03:12.320 --> 03:14.320]  The globalists are the ones that hate the Americana record.
[03:14.320 --> 03:16.320]  They don't know what to do.
[03:16.320 --> 03:23.680]  So 2015, a year plus, a year and a half before they now have been caught spying on Trump,
[03:23.680 --> 03:25.280]  now we know they were spying back then.
[03:25.280 --> 03:30.880]  Of course, they were with human intelligence, there was electronic total surveillance going
[03:30.880 --> 03:34.840]  on starting in 2009.
[03:34.840 --> 03:37.520]  Now let's expand on that.
[03:37.520 --> 03:39.760]  You fast forward.
[03:39.760 --> 03:43.280]  We've got these deep state moles in there that have been trying to block these secret
[03:43.280 --> 03:50.440]  documents getting transferred out of the DOJ to the House Intelligence Committees and others.
[03:50.440 --> 03:54.960]  Now we know why he's leaving Congress, he knew this was all going to come out.
[03:54.960 --> 03:59.760]  Gowdy's a former federal prosecutor, his cover has been completely blown.
[03:59.760 --> 04:03.120]  He's obviously been compromised decades ago.
[04:03.120 --> 04:08.200]  Just like Jeff Sessions was a federal prosecutor and U.S. attorney and all these other things,
[04:08.200 --> 04:10.880]  high level deputy head of the Justice Department.
[04:10.880 --> 04:14.840]  These guys know where the bodies have been buried, but that also makes them corrupt.
[04:14.840 --> 04:15.840]  That makes them compromise.
[04:15.840 --> 04:21.880]  That's what Greg Gowdy now unclogged as a sith, so we now have that going on.
[04:21.880 --> 04:27.360]  You have McCabe, as you said, trying to get immunity.
[04:27.360 --> 04:30.840]  That immunity will also protect him from perjury, so it's a double entendre.
[04:30.840 --> 04:34.160]  He doesn't just want protection because he's going to release criminal stuff they've done.
[04:34.160 --> 04:40.840]  He wants people to spin it and lie about it in Congress and then be protected from perjury
[04:40.840 --> 04:43.880]  with the immunity, so that's a double edge.
[04:43.880 --> 04:48.920]  So, we're going to walk through all this because a lot more when we come back is remember,
[04:48.920 --> 04:53.600]  oh, no one was spying even electronically, oh, no one was even monitoring, oh, there
[04:53.600 --> 05:00.800]  was no human, oh, there was, it's all totally insane, Alex Jones, Alex Jones is insane.
[05:00.800 --> 05:06.280]  The Senate released 500 pages of documents, including more text messages between FBI agent
[05:06.280 --> 05:08.600]  Peter Struck and lawyer Lisa Page.
[05:08.600 --> 05:13.400]  And now there's speculation that those texts suggest the FBI may have been spying on Donald
[05:13.400 --> 05:15.360]  Trump's campaign earlier than thought.
[05:15.360 --> 05:21.520]  The previously redacted text from December 2015 revealed the approval of Akonas Luris,
[05:21.520 --> 05:25.920]  which is counterintelligence lingo for spies operating outside of the U.S.
[05:25.920 --> 05:30.520]  Now, PJ Media reported that Struck was leading the Clinton investigation at the time and would
[05:30.520 --> 05:33.680]  go on to play a central role in the Trump-Russia probe.
[05:33.680 --> 05:38.600]  It's being assumed that the pair was referring to the FBI's efforts to bait and hook unsuspecting
[05:38.600 --> 05:41.320]  Trump campaign officials overseas.
[05:41.320 --> 05:46.280]  President Trump took to Twitter to bash the corrupt FBI lovers, saying Spygate is in full
[05:46.280 --> 05:47.280]  force.
[05:47.280 --> 05:52.560]  The revelations come as former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe requested immunity
[05:52.560 --> 05:57.080]  in exchange for testimony regarding what he knows about the Clinton and Russia collusion
[05:57.080 --> 05:58.080]  investigations.
[05:58.080 --> 06:27.000]  It's Thursday, June 7, 2018, and you, right now, listening to this, are living in some
[06:27.000 --> 06:34.800]  of the most remarkable, historical, truly amazing times in human history.
[06:34.800 --> 06:37.880]  And more than anything, I just want you to be a part of it.
[06:37.880 --> 06:43.840]  But here we are today dealing with a deep state that has been corrupting American politics
[06:43.840 --> 06:45.200]  for decades.
[06:45.200 --> 06:49.520]  Donald Trump came along and wanted to do something about it, and everything that has followed
[06:49.520 --> 06:51.920]  is a result of that.
[06:51.920 --> 06:54.400]  Now, Alex Jones joins me here.
[06:54.400 --> 06:57.920]  He is on vacation, but he is joining us live to break all of this down.
[06:57.920 --> 07:06.360]  The McCabe request for immunity, the threat to jail, Manafort, the exposure of the Oconus
[07:06.360 --> 07:12.520]  Lures, a.k.a. foreign spies, used by the Obama administration against the Trump campaign.
[07:12.520 --> 07:14.920]  Alex Jones joins me now to break it all down.
[07:14.920 --> 07:19.200]  Alex, these are truly historic times that we're living in, and we've been preparing
[07:19.200 --> 07:24.560]  for this, really, for years, expecting this news to finally come to the public.
[07:24.560 --> 07:28.760]  That's right, and we have hundreds and hundreds of pieces of incredible news today to cover.
[07:28.760 --> 07:36.080]  But out of all these that fit into this constellation of information, remember Groober, Jonathan Groober,
[07:36.080 --> 07:41.120]  three years ago, saying, I came up with Obamacare as a way to double and triple prices.
[07:41.120 --> 07:46.560]  The president needed to deceive the public, so I came up with a plan where we'd phase
[07:46.560 --> 07:48.040]  it in over several years.
[07:48.040 --> 07:50.640]  First, we'd tell them that it would give them free health care.
[07:50.640 --> 07:52.760]  Then we'd tell them that it would be the price of a cable bill.
[07:52.760 --> 07:54.640]  Then we'd tell them that they could keep their doctor.
[07:54.640 --> 07:58.120]  Then we'd tell them, oh, we always told you, you have a double and triple prices.
[07:58.120 --> 08:02.840]  And he said on C-SPAN in front of a bunch of top professors, he said, thank God they're
[08:02.840 --> 08:06.200]  so stupid, thank God they have no memory.
[08:06.200 --> 08:11.320]  So they're hoping you don't have a memory as they insult your intelligence, but in full
[08:11.320 --> 08:14.320]  wars, it is about having a memory.
[08:14.320 --> 08:18.020]  Our audience does have a memory, and we also go back into the memory hole, coming up next
[08:18.020 --> 08:19.020]  segment.
[08:19.020 --> 08:25.720]  I'm going to play a clip from back on March 3rd of 2017.
[08:25.720 --> 08:30.800]  The president had just been in for a couple months, and remembers seeing and said the source
[08:30.800 --> 08:36.680]  of Trump saying he was being spied on was in full wars, and that we were totally insane.
[08:36.680 --> 08:43.120]  But the truth is, we show in the report, the actual New York Times article from the 20th,
[08:43.120 --> 08:47.840]  where they admitted he was being spied on, and they admitted it in November.
[08:47.840 --> 08:51.880]  They admitted it in December and the 1st of January.
[08:51.880 --> 08:56.520]  Within two days of Trump being elected, they panicked and went, don't worry in the news.
[08:56.520 --> 08:58.400]  Obama had been monitoring Trump.
[08:58.400 --> 08:59.400]  They are Russians.
[08:59.400 --> 09:00.400]  We have the proof.
[09:00.400 --> 09:03.960]  That was a bold announcement to people in the government.
[09:03.960 --> 09:04.960]  Stay there.
[09:04.960 --> 09:05.960]  He's not going to get seated.
[09:05.960 --> 09:08.120]  We're going to block the delegates.
[09:08.120 --> 09:09.120]  He will not.
[09:09.120 --> 09:13.120]  He will not get the delegates from the electoral college.
[09:13.120 --> 09:16.720]  And remember, they had Pelosi's daughter on TV saying, Alex Jones is threatening me.
[09:16.720 --> 09:19.960]  I want him arrested on Fox News.
[09:19.960 --> 09:21.240]  I had never threatened her.
[09:21.240 --> 09:26.000]  I had just said it was traitorous and any legal and criminal to be trying to block those
[09:26.000 --> 09:29.200]  delegates being seated on the 7th of January.
[09:29.200 --> 09:32.280]  So up until then, they were announcing he is a Russian.
[09:32.280 --> 09:34.840]  Obama was monitoring him.
[09:34.840 --> 09:35.920]  We know he's a Russian.
[09:35.920 --> 09:37.280]  We have total proof.
[09:37.280 --> 09:38.800]  He was financed by Russians.
[09:38.800 --> 09:44.080]  And then they started, of course, pushing the PPK dossier and then just all these incredible
[09:44.080 --> 09:46.680]  stories to make people in government.
[09:46.680 --> 09:52.320]  The rest of them, again, are just mentally ill, fellow traveler control freaks, and just
[09:52.320 --> 09:53.920]  read the straw emails and the rest of it.
[09:53.920 --> 10:01.160]  The text messages, these are a bunch of bumbling, panicking, just insane leftists.
[10:01.160 --> 10:03.680]  They all believe the Russiagate thing.
[10:03.680 --> 10:05.200]  They went along with it.
[10:05.200 --> 10:07.960]  They tried to block Trump, believing that he would never get seated.
[10:07.960 --> 10:12.720]  Then he got seated as president, then they got more hysterical.
[10:12.720 --> 10:16.840]  There goes on TV and says, the intelligence community has seven ways this Sunday to get
[10:16.840 --> 10:17.840]  you.
[10:17.840 --> 10:18.840]  All the threats come out.
[10:18.840 --> 10:19.840]  They say, we have the proof.
[10:19.840 --> 10:20.840]  Don't worry.
[10:20.840 --> 10:24.360]  But the truth is, the proof was on them.
[10:24.360 --> 10:26.640]  So all of that began to unfold.
[10:26.640 --> 10:28.200]  All of that began to go on.
[10:28.200 --> 10:29.720]  And Trump was now the president.
[10:29.720 --> 10:31.720]  He could declassify anything he wanted.
[10:31.720 --> 10:35.720]  He is the final person who can declassify anything he wishes.
[10:35.720 --> 10:37.720]  That's another constitution.
[10:37.720 --> 10:40.080]  That's a part of his executive power.
[10:40.080 --> 10:42.000]  Well, Trump decided not to.
[10:42.000 --> 10:47.120]  He just said, you guys were illegally spying on me and you can go to prison for that.
[10:47.120 --> 10:48.920]  And you illegally leaked it as well.
[10:48.920 --> 10:53.960]  And they went, that is preposterous starting on January 21st of last year.
[10:53.960 --> 10:56.760]  They said, that is preposterous.
[10:56.760 --> 10:57.760]  That is insane.
[10:57.760 --> 11:02.240]  Remember, I mean, up until just recently, they would say every day, it's totally not
[11:02.240 --> 11:03.240]  true.
[11:03.240 --> 11:05.960]  Bill Maher last Friday said that I'm super evil, Alex Jones is evil.
[11:05.960 --> 11:06.960]  He's a liar.
[11:06.960 --> 11:09.280]  No one's spying on Trump.
[11:09.280 --> 11:14.040]  So they can't be the propaganda straight now, fast forward until now.
[11:14.040 --> 11:15.600]  They had perjured themselves to Congress.
[11:15.600 --> 11:18.440]  They have illegally leaked false information.
[11:18.440 --> 11:20.760]  They've gone and gotten warrants with false information.
[11:20.760 --> 11:25.560]  They've paid their wives and husbands at Fusion GPS millions of dollars for false information.
[11:25.560 --> 11:28.360]  McCabe's wife's been given a half million by Hillary.
[11:28.360 --> 11:31.840]  All of this is now coming out piling up.
[11:31.840 --> 11:36.440]  They were set up by Trump beautifully when he knew all this from day one.
[11:36.440 --> 11:38.960]  Let them take debate.
[11:38.960 --> 11:40.520]  Let them take it hook, line and sinker.
[11:40.520 --> 11:42.520]  They ran out with it for a long, long time.
[11:42.520 --> 11:43.520]  Now they're exhausted.
[11:43.520 --> 11:45.160]  Now they're being reeled back again.
[11:45.160 --> 11:49.760]  Now they're being gaffed one after the next, thrown into the boat to be taken back to dock
[11:49.760 --> 11:52.680]  and sliced up and then put into delicious deep fry.
[11:52.680 --> 11:57.000]  We're going to have hush puppies, maybe even have a little, maybe even have a little toddy
[11:57.000 --> 11:59.640]  or something, you know, after that it'll be some cold beer.
[11:59.640 --> 12:02.120]  Now, but we're not back to dock yet.
[12:02.120 --> 12:04.440]  We haven't gotten the ship in and we haven't sliced them up yet.
[12:04.440 --> 12:05.440]  So we're not there yet.
[12:05.440 --> 12:08.600]  But let me tell you, we're getting well into the third act here.
[12:08.600 --> 12:10.120]  The fat lady's a little bit down the road.
[12:10.120 --> 12:14.280]  I think we might be hearing her sing, at least on this critical chapter in history, but the
[12:14.280 --> 12:16.960]  enemy is cornered.
[12:16.960 --> 12:22.360]  Now all the cornered rats are going to show themselves suddenly, Paul Ryan, this great
[12:22.360 --> 12:28.680]  speaker suddenly counting the pinhead, Boba Lai, you know, the glass doll.
[12:28.680 --> 12:35.880]  Suddenly all of these people are unclogging and are showing themselves saying, oh of course.
[12:35.880 --> 12:40.080]  We were surveilling him, it's no big deal, it's just the FBI, and it's just the Democrats,
[12:40.080 --> 12:43.680]  you know, 13 of them running this special project secretly and illegally.
[12:43.680 --> 12:48.840]  And yes, it's totally normal just to monitor everything because, you know, there were Russians
[12:48.840 --> 12:50.360]  which have now been disproven.
[12:50.360 --> 12:53.400]  And so, okay, yeah, it's about a thousand times worse than a Watergate.
[12:53.400 --> 12:57.720]  But just move along, move along, nothing to see here, go away.
[12:57.720 --> 13:00.760]  How dare you be anti-law enforcement, Trump?
[13:00.760 --> 13:04.640]  But everybody's going, wait a minute, you said you weren't spying on him for the last
[13:04.640 --> 13:09.760]  couple of years, but even though the general public's memory isn't that good, they steal
[13:09.760 --> 13:13.320]  and they hurt it 10,000 times in every late night comedy show.
[13:13.320 --> 13:16.560]  In fact, we've got a special compilation of Rob Duke and Find It.
[13:16.560 --> 13:20.760]  I wanted it last week, we couldn't, it's no big deal, but I think we brain-made one.
[13:20.760 --> 13:25.400]  It's a short compilation of just late night comedy, just a few minutes up.
[13:25.400 --> 13:27.760]  There's a longer one, I don't want to play that one, it's like a five minute one.
[13:27.760 --> 13:32.800]  There's about a minute and a half of late night comedy saying, Alex Jones is insane.
[13:32.800 --> 13:36.040]  He told Trump he's being spied on and then it's CNN saying it.
[13:36.040 --> 13:42.240]  I think that's a compilation, I really, really want, because it just shows the viewers, the
[13:42.240 --> 13:47.840]  listeners, what we're dealing with, how stupid they think everybody is, so now we're getting
[13:47.840 --> 13:48.840]  down the line.
[13:48.840 --> 13:50.400]  Now they've committed incredible crimes.
[13:50.400 --> 13:53.440]  Now they've come up with empty-handed on the fake Russiagate thing, what are they going
[13:53.440 --> 13:54.440]  to do?
[13:54.440 --> 13:57.520]  Well, they're not going to give up their criminals, they have nothing to lose, so now they're
[13:57.520 --> 14:02.360]  threatening Manafort, supposedly speaking out, I'm saying you better shut up.
[14:02.360 --> 14:07.600]  Now they are trying to squeeze other people and now they admit, mainstream news, okay,
[14:07.600 --> 14:08.600]  there's no Russia.
[14:08.600 --> 14:12.800]  Now it is processed, just as we predicted, that somebody might have made a false statement
[14:12.800 --> 14:16.960]  or somebody might have bounced a check 10 years ago, literally, or somebody might have filled
[14:16.960 --> 14:22.840]  out on a checkbook something wrong seven years ago, or somebody literally might have bought
[14:22.840 --> 14:23.840]  a sandwich.
[14:23.840 --> 14:27.240]  These are the type of questions going on with Roger Stone's people.
[14:27.240 --> 14:32.280]  Someone might have bought a sandwich on a political account and got a glass of tea.
[14:32.280 --> 14:37.160]  So we're now down to like $11 and $12 and $15 stuff on expense accounts.
[14:37.160 --> 14:40.720]  When you see the whole economy coming back, when you see the Republic being reborn, when
[14:40.720 --> 14:46.080]  you see sovereignty and confidence, all of this, and you see political correctness in
[14:46.080 --> 14:50.440]  Hollywood and the chai comms and the devil pope and everyone back on their heels in the
[14:50.440 --> 14:54.080]  pedophile armies, back on their heels, all this is happening.
[14:54.080 --> 14:57.560]  There are still hordes of people who can't even name one Obama accomplishment that was
[14:57.560 --> 15:02.520]  good, still saying they hate Trump because they're a bunch of jellyfish followers born
[15:02.520 --> 15:06.760]  in the bosom of liberty who are spoiled rotten brats and don't realize how damn good they've
[15:06.760 --> 15:10.960]  had it because they live inside a bubble because they are the goldfish.
[15:10.960 --> 15:11.960]  We are awake.
[15:11.960 --> 15:12.960]  We are conscious.
[15:12.960 --> 15:13.960]  We have a memory.
[15:13.960 --> 15:14.960]  We're trying to have a future.
[15:14.960 --> 15:16.240]  We've proven we know what we're doing.
[15:16.240 --> 15:17.240]  We are America.
[15:17.240 --> 15:18.600]  We are the Renaissance.
[15:18.600 --> 15:20.880]  We are Western civilization worldwide.
[15:20.880 --> 15:25.320]  And the globalists don't know what to do and they're panicking and so the big question
[15:25.320 --> 15:27.920]  is, what are they going to do next?
[15:27.920 --> 15:30.000]  That is the big, giant question.
[15:30.000 --> 15:33.920]  What are they going to do next, my friend?
[15:33.920 --> 15:37.840]  Well, they won't go away without a fight.
[15:37.840 --> 15:42.640]  We know that much and we're starting to see some of that fight, but Trump really has the
[15:42.640 --> 15:47.160]  ace up his sleeve when it comes to this Mueller probe because he can pardon Flynn.
[15:47.160 --> 15:48.680]  He can pardon Manafort.
[15:48.680 --> 15:49.680]  They know it.
[15:49.680 --> 15:54.280]  And so they're trying to act like he's bad for using the pardoning power now before he
[15:54.280 --> 15:56.600]  does it to all these innocent people the deep state tried to take out.
[15:56.600 --> 15:57.600]  We'll be right back with Alex Jones.
[15:57.600 --> 15:58.600]  Don't go anywhere.

[16:47.120 --> 16:50.280]  We've got to get this out because this can hear away folks, doesn't mean other people
[16:50.280 --> 16:51.280]  are.
[16:51.280 --> 16:54.120]  It's critical to get, to read, to go to the library, to give you the courage to get them

[17:17.720 --> 17:20.400]  He once called global warming a political scam.
[17:20.400 --> 17:24.600]  He's made millions betting on investments seen as too controversial by the mainstream.
[17:24.600 --> 17:29.000]  In this new book, Casey reveals shocking predictions about hot issues like immigration,
[17:29.000 --> 17:31.040]  Russia and the next stock super boom.

[18:30.920 --> 18:35.880]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation like canning or dehydrating,

[18:57.800 --> 19:00.800]  Check it out right now at infowarstore.com.
[19:00.800 --> 19:06.040]  Infowars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen blocks.
[19:06.040 --> 19:11.200]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[19:11.200 --> 19:18.040]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory functions.
[19:18.040 --> 19:23.880]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[19:23.880 --> 19:26.680]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[19:26.680 --> 19:32.160]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit
[19:32.160 --> 19:37.200]  of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[19:37.200 --> 19:38.200]  symptoms.
[19:38.200 --> 19:43.280]  Pollen block is natural and effective, it is not an antihistamine, in fact, current
[19:43.280 --> 19:47.800]  research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase, which is
[19:47.800 --> 19:52.600]  an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[19:52.600 --> 19:55.280]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[19:55.280 --> 20:04.040]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[20:04.040 --> 20:33.880]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:33.880 --> 20:40.400]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show, filling in in studio here at the infowars world headquarters
[20:40.400 --> 20:41.400]  in Austin, Texas.
[20:41.400 --> 20:42.400]  I'm Owen Troyer.
[20:42.400 --> 20:45.920]  Alex is on the road reporting on all the breaking news that's coming.
[20:45.920 --> 20:53.720]  You may have seen the headline Mueller requests witnesses cell phones in Russia probe.
[20:53.720 --> 20:55.960]  Let me just translate that for you.
[20:55.960 --> 20:59.480]  Mueller has nothing in Russia probe.
[20:59.480 --> 21:01.960]  If he had anything, he wouldn't need the cell phones.
[21:01.960 --> 21:07.280]  And I find it ironic how they're now using the Daily Beast, the Politico, all these
[21:07.280 --> 21:08.880]  hack news websites.
[21:08.880 --> 21:15.000]  They're saying Ivanka was in contact with Russians, tried to set up a meeting with Putin.
[21:15.000 --> 21:20.840]  If Donald Trump was colluding with Putin, why would he need Ivanka to attempt to set
[21:20.840 --> 21:22.680]  up a meeting with Putin?
[21:22.680 --> 21:25.560]  These people are so insane, they don't even see it.
[21:25.560 --> 21:29.640]  But as Alex Jones was breaking down in the last segment, they're like goldfish in a bottle
[21:29.640 --> 21:35.920]  just being observed and manipulated and fed whatever the owner decides to feed them.
[21:35.920 --> 21:39.920]  Alex, you were just getting into that the foreign spies that they had in the Trump
[21:39.920 --> 21:40.920]  campaign.
[21:40.920 --> 21:41.920]  How it's all about to be exposed.
[21:41.920 --> 21:42.920]  That's right.
[21:42.920 --> 21:46.920]  We're going to put a new compilation video together today.
[21:46.920 --> 21:52.360]  We're going to air it today because we did another compilation video here at once.
[21:52.360 --> 21:53.360]  We can't find it.
[21:53.360 --> 21:55.680]  But the point is we're going to put a new one today.
[21:55.680 --> 21:59.120]  So whoever's doing the video grabbing, here's what I want on air.
[21:59.120 --> 22:02.120]  We're going to have a little project on this right now.
[22:02.120 --> 22:07.120]  I want Bill Maher last Friday saying Alex Jones is insane and he's the source saying
[22:07.120 --> 22:15.000]  that Trump is being spied on by the FBI and then he shows them FullWars.com article.
[22:15.000 --> 22:16.320]  He does it twice.
[22:16.320 --> 22:17.840]  I want that.
[22:17.840 --> 22:27.080]  I want to cut that in with all three of the late night comedy hosts, Fallon, Colbert and
[22:27.080 --> 22:28.080]  the other one.
[22:28.080 --> 22:34.280]  There's just quick clips, I want like a minute of it, of those guys saying the source for
[22:34.280 --> 22:39.720]  Trump is Alex Jones and FullWars and then I want to cut it to Anderson Cooper saying
[22:39.720 --> 22:41.600]  the source is Alex Jones and FullWars.
[22:41.600 --> 22:48.280]  I want to really throw that in their face because they hope no one remembers and I know
[22:48.280 --> 22:51.440]  as an audience, you remember and you go, Alex, we know all about it.
[22:51.440 --> 22:52.440]  We don't need to hear about this.
[22:52.440 --> 22:53.440]  Tell us what's new.
[22:53.440 --> 22:57.960]  The general public, ladies and gentlemen, does not remember this.
[22:57.960 --> 23:02.920]  If you simply show it to them or point it out to them, they will absolutely have an
[23:02.920 --> 23:04.800]  epiphany that they've been lied to.
[23:04.800 --> 23:07.040]  This is a critical point.
[23:07.040 --> 23:14.160]  They have committed operations here literally hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
[23:14.160 --> 23:18.280]  and hundreds of times more insane than anything Richard Nixon ever did.
[23:18.280 --> 23:23.840]  Nixon got in trouble, never got caught himself for having the plumbers break into the guy
[23:23.840 --> 23:29.280]  he was running against, the Democratic Party, break into his psychiatrist operation.
[23:29.280 --> 23:35.680]  This one, Nixon was 20 points ahead of him in polls, ended up weighing in a landslide,
[23:35.680 --> 23:40.000]  never got the information, never used the information that were globalist inside the
[23:40.000 --> 23:45.080]  White House that knew the murder he took place, used it to bring down Nixon.
[23:45.080 --> 23:49.800]  So this is how they operate and so that was breaking into a psychiatrist's office.
[23:49.800 --> 23:56.400]  This is years of illegal spying, tens of millions of dollars of taxpayer money spent to do it,
[23:56.400 --> 24:03.640]  fake reports, lying to Congress, lying to get fake warrants, lying to create parallel construction.
[24:03.640 --> 24:10.640]  All of this is coming out now and you've got, just shamefully, a tray goutie sitting there,
[24:10.640 --> 24:11.640]  settling going.
[24:11.640 --> 24:15.160]  It's quite normal to have the FBI spy on everything you did, really.
[24:15.160 --> 24:16.960]  Is that why you all lied about it?
[24:16.960 --> 24:19.880]  Imagine if the FBI had been inside Hillary's campaign, no.
[24:19.880 --> 24:27.280]  The very same people, McCabe and Strach, are the ones that ran the kid gloves, fake investigations
[24:27.280 --> 24:31.320]  of Uranium One, of Hillary's server, of all of it.
[24:31.320 --> 24:35.480]  The very same people that are in their text messages saying, she's going to be president,
[24:35.480 --> 24:39.080]  but we better really, you know, softball this thing.
[24:39.080 --> 24:44.600]  Those very people are the ones that then ran the operation against Trump and here's the
[24:44.600 --> 24:45.600]  final equation.
[24:45.600 --> 24:52.720]  The big one, the big burrito, as they said, the big enchilada, and that's that we know
[24:52.720 --> 24:59.280]  this wouldn't have been done unless Obama and Susan Rice and Samantha Powers ordered
[24:59.280 --> 25:04.200]  it and I've been told by high-level sources that they are the ones that ordered it and
[25:04.200 --> 25:06.480]  guess who those high-level sources were?
[25:06.480 --> 25:13.480]  Again, back in November, back in December and back in early January, they were quoted
[25:13.480 --> 25:17.040]  in Atlantic Monthly, The New York Times, The New Yorker Magazine, you name it, by the
[25:17.040 --> 25:24.560]  scared left saying, don't worry, senior administration officials were aware of the Russian penetration
[25:24.560 --> 25:31.480]  and were monitoring and spying on Trump with conventional wiretaps, digital spies, you
[25:31.480 --> 25:32.480]  name it.
[25:32.480 --> 25:35.440]  Again, we've pulled these articles, we've written stories about it.
[25:35.440 --> 25:40.840]  They were the ones that bragged that they were spying on Trump.
[25:40.840 --> 25:42.520]  Their arrogance is incredible.
[25:42.520 --> 25:44.680]  Chuck E. Schumer's arrogance is incredible.
[25:44.680 --> 25:49.520]  The fact that the Democrats can't even find leadership, the fact that the Democrats can't
[25:49.520 --> 25:55.160]  even find who is going to lead their party and don't even understand it's a crisis is
[25:55.160 --> 25:56.160]  evidence.
[25:56.160 --> 26:00.280]  We have an amazing video coming up that you're going to play in the next segment, Owen, of
[26:00.280 --> 26:04.600]  Savannah Hernandez going out and this is basically unedited, she just cut the spaces
[26:04.600 --> 26:05.600]  out.
[26:05.600 --> 26:11.120]  They could not find anybody in downtown Austin.
[26:11.120 --> 26:13.520]  They could not find anybody down by Barton Springs.
[26:13.520 --> 26:18.960]  They could not find anybody at the University of Texas who could say an accomplishment of
[26:18.960 --> 26:19.960]  Obama.
[26:19.960 --> 26:23.800]  They couldn't say an accomplishment, well, let me give you his accomplishments, creating
[26:23.800 --> 26:28.960]  the worst race relations in this country in 65, 70 years, almost destroying the Second
[26:28.960 --> 26:34.600]  Amendment, freezing our economy, transferring most of our weapons technology and energy
[26:34.600 --> 26:39.720]  technology to China, allowing the office of personal management hack that totally exposed
[26:39.720 --> 26:45.400]  our entire systems, launching the huge Arab Spring that killed over a million people and
[26:45.400 --> 26:52.360]  toppled many of our allies and put radical Islamic regimes in power, helping create ISIS,
[26:52.360 --> 26:56.760]  standing down during Benghazi, allowing that nightmare to take place, and the list goes
[26:56.760 --> 26:57.760]  on and on.
[26:57.760 --> 27:03.280]  So we should actually have a video report where we list the real accomplishments of Barack
[27:03.280 --> 27:04.280]  Hussein Obama.
[27:04.280 --> 27:10.720]  Just thinking today, I might sit down for a few hours and write out a list of Obama's
[27:10.720 --> 27:16.880]  real accomplishments from a globalist perspective like Pope Francis the Peter Pope and his
[27:16.880 --> 27:22.000]  accomplishments, wrecking the Catholic Church, wrecking Christianity, opening Europe up to
[27:22.000 --> 27:28.480]  Islam, attacking the family, attacking family values, watering down the Catholic stance
[27:28.480 --> 27:33.800]  on abortion, on and on and on, and to see it from their perspective, wrecking free market,
[27:33.800 --> 27:41.160]  wrecking the West, wrecking the family, this is their goal, this is their operation, swallowing
[27:41.160 --> 27:46.280]  up a whole generation of millennials that think he's God, it is truly a shameful situation,
[27:46.280 --> 27:50.040]  but we should also open the phones up and just ask the listeners, what do they think
[27:50.040 --> 27:53.240]  is going to happen as all of this unfolds?
[27:53.240 --> 27:58.200]  Now that said, ladies and gentlemen, they're cornered and they're going to strike back
[27:58.200 --> 28:02.760]  and we're not out of the woods yet, but I could tell you at this point they're not
[28:02.760 --> 28:09.000]  going to get away with what they've done in the past and even if they kill Trump or killed
[28:09.000 --> 28:14.280]  me or killed a hundred other Patriot leaders, they will never reverse the tide against them,
[28:14.280 --> 28:19.200]  the world knows the truth, the thinking man and woman of every race, color and creed understands
[28:19.200 --> 28:25.520]  the score and is supporting the Patriot institutions like M4 Wars and are spreading the word despite
[28:25.520 --> 28:30.160]  all the censorship and notice Google's been off more than they can chew, calling all Republicans
[28:30.160 --> 28:33.840]  Nazis, that's going to blow up now, they're having congressional hearings with Congressman
[28:33.840 --> 28:40.840]  Nunes, it's happening and so these big tech giants are going to get broken up, these globalist
[28:40.840 --> 28:46.640]  institutions that have gone too far, they're going to find out the truth because they have
[28:46.640 --> 28:51.040]  pushed and pushed and pushed, but I do want to encourage listeners to continue to support
[28:51.040 --> 28:57.000]  M4 Wars and we've got one of the biggest sales ever and free shipping on all of that

[33:04.000 --> 33:20.080]  You are listening to the Alex Jones show. You are listening to an Infowars.com front
[33:20.080 --> 33:27.840]  line report. If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. And now your host
[33:27.840 --> 33:33.320]  Owen Troyer. Alright ladies and gentlemen, you have been hearing the latest from Alex
[33:33.320 --> 33:39.520]  Jones in regards to why you have the deep state panicking right now with the Mueller
[33:39.520 --> 33:47.040]  probe totally being exposed for the witch hunt partisan hack job that it is, which is
[33:47.040 --> 33:51.000]  of course run on the top by the globalists which need to bring down America in order
[33:51.000 --> 33:54.520]  to bring in the one world government. Alex Jones was breaking that down before we go
[33:54.520 --> 33:59.920]  to the clip of Savannah Hernandez going in Austin, Texas asking people Obama's accomplishments
[33:59.920 --> 34:05.160]  and they come up empty. Alex Jones, break that down one more time for us. The historical
[34:05.160 --> 34:09.400]  times we're living in. That's right. And I want to be very clear listeners, we better
[34:09.400 --> 34:13.520]  get on our knees and thank God because a lot of people prayed for Providence. They prayed
[34:13.520 --> 34:19.160]  for a Nineveh reprieve. We've still got huge problems facing us on so many fronts, but
[34:19.160 --> 34:25.200]  at least we have a spirit now in this country and a group of people who want to work for
[34:25.200 --> 34:32.600]  a true positive future. And there is a spirit in America of awakening and it's historic.
[34:32.600 --> 34:37.320]  And people really, really should be thankful. Imagine what it would be like right now if
[34:37.320 --> 34:41.920]  Hillary Clinton had been in office. Ladies and gentlemen, it'd be far worse with the
[34:41.920 --> 34:45.840]  censorship and all the other things. The economy would have been stalled out. They were planning
[34:45.840 --> 34:50.760]  a race war. Those documents have come out. They were planning a war between the sexes
[34:50.760 --> 34:56.480]  that they're still pushing when you go look at leftist propaganda. So this is such a historic
[34:56.480 --> 35:02.320]  time. And I'm just so thankful that God's giving us this chance, but it's just that
[35:02.320 --> 35:08.480]  it's a chance. Imagine if I had told you two years ago that they would have the globalists
[35:08.480 --> 35:15.500]  collapsing worldwide. Bilderberg now is in CNBC and they're saying, oh, Bilderberg's the
[35:15.500 --> 35:20.000]  group that cares and is truthful. Daniels wrote a story for NewsWars.com. There's a
[35:20.000 --> 35:24.240]  couple. You should go read it. Oh, they're the group that wants to save America and cares
[35:24.240 --> 35:29.600]  about freedom. They're the truthful, good people. Just six, seven years ago, CNBC said
[35:29.600 --> 35:36.680]  I was insane and Bilderberg didn't exist. Just a decade ago, Drudge Report was the first
[35:36.680 --> 35:44.240]  major U.S. media organization to start linking to our reports. Think about how far we've
[35:44.240 --> 35:49.160]  come and how every major global publication admits they're falling apart, at least preparing
[35:49.160 --> 35:53.680]  to pull out of the Euro. These tyrants thought they could really be above the law and tax
[35:53.680 --> 35:58.480]  exempt and then tell us that they're SJWs and that we're bad if we're making a couple
[35:58.480 --> 36:03.600]  hundred thousand dollars a year. I mean, look at Bloomberg saying that poor people, people
[36:03.600 --> 36:08.160]  making thirty thousand dollars a year, could pay more taxes. They should pay no taxes.
[36:08.160 --> 36:15.040]  That is completely insane. They want full control. So listeners, yes, we're turning
[36:15.040 --> 36:22.400]  the tide here, but Info Wars is under mega-massive attack. It is under sustained enemy attack.
[36:22.400 --> 36:26.760]  And when you financially support us, it is the game changer. But they believe they can
[36:26.760 --> 36:31.160]  shut us down. It's going to set the precedent. That's why everybody, if you go to infowarstore.com
[36:31.160 --> 36:35.680]  and get supplements and nutraceuticals, you really need, we have got some of our best-selling
[36:35.680 --> 36:40.320]  products at 50% off right now and free shipping. The sale is going to have to end this week
[36:40.320 --> 36:45.160]  because things like DNA force are selling out, things like X2, the biggest special we've
[36:45.160 --> 36:48.880]  ever offered is selling out. But I want people who haven't tried it to try it and see how
[36:48.880 --> 36:54.800]  amazing X2 is. InfoWars.com, we're getting very, very close the next few weeks and selling
[36:54.800 --> 37:00.520]  out of BrainForce. Our best-selling Neutropic, it's only $19.95 right now. InfoWars.com,

[37:05.840 --> 37:08.400]  all they're trying to do to shut us down. So I want to salute you all for your help
[37:08.400 --> 37:12.240]  and your support. I want to thank you all. Being on vacation, I'm running into record
[37:12.240 --> 37:17.840]  numbers of people of every race, color, and creed who love liberty. The awakening is here,
[37:17.840 --> 37:22.720]  ladies and gentlemen, but the fight has just begun. So again, infowarstore.com, infowarslife.com,
[37:22.720 --> 37:26.080]  we're triple A, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine. Please take advantage of these
[37:26.080 --> 37:30.640]  record sales right now. And whatever you do, please pray for us. We're praying for you
[37:30.640 --> 37:35.320]  and spread the videos and the articles. Now, this again is what we really found. Democrats
[37:35.320 --> 37:39.720]  unable liberals, just average Austinites in the bluest of blue in Texas, in the heart
[37:39.720 --> 37:46.160]  of Austin, unable to mention or think of one good thing Obama has done. You talk about
[37:46.160 --> 37:50.600]  goldfish, they literally have no memory. These are very, very sad people that we need to help
[37:50.600 --> 37:55.520]  and pray for. Here they are. Monday, March, President Trump's 500th day in office. And
[37:55.520 --> 37:59.680]  while he's made many historic accomplishments, many people are still giving Obama credit
[37:59.680 --> 38:03.360]  for everything that's been going on with the economy, with employment rates. So we're
[38:03.360 --> 38:07.200]  out here on this beautiful day in Barton Springs to ask people what they think was Obama's
[38:07.200 --> 38:09.240]  greatest accomplishment during his presidency.
[38:09.240 --> 38:19.840]  Ooh, that's a hard question. Five minutes later. Obama's most, like, his biggest accomplishment.
[38:19.840 --> 38:26.080]  Two very boring minutes later. I really, I don't know. I can't really think of one
[38:26.080 --> 38:30.480]  right now. And this is like, this is like putting me on the spot because I'm from D.C.
[38:30.480 --> 38:38.000]  So I should be able to give you an answer. Yeah, I can't think of one. I think, I think
[38:38.000 --> 38:46.240]  that would, geez, anything, anything from you. No, I'm so sorry. I can't give you an
[38:46.240 --> 38:53.080]  answer for that. What Obama did. I honestly have no idea. He would probably be better
[38:53.080 --> 39:06.000]  at answering this question. Do you want to answer? Yes, I. Yeah. 20 minutes later. Yeah,
[39:06.000 --> 39:20.200]  I don't know. Go on, sedan. I'd be it. I would say Obama Obama needs equality of marriage.
[39:20.200 --> 39:26.560]  He pulled back one of the worst recessions in our history and got us to a place where
[39:26.560 --> 39:34.280]  we were growing instead of shrinking. He brought dignity to the office, both at home and internationally.
[39:34.280 --> 39:41.400]  Yeah, we really looked up to him. We're really sad to see Obama leave. I'm from the UK, so
[39:41.400 --> 39:46.320]  I've not got a clue, but he's not got a very good reputation in the UK from Obama or Trump
[39:46.320 --> 39:51.600]  from. Yeah, but other than that, I was watching something on news this morning. I think you
[39:51.600 --> 39:56.400]  are on Fox and they seem to be saying a lot of good things about him. So in comparison,
[39:56.400 --> 40:02.440]  I have no idea, but it seems from my perspective as an Englishman, it seems to be turning some
[40:02.440 --> 40:08.960]  people's perspectives around. Actually, I'm not really sure. Like, I think he's like a
[40:08.960 --> 40:15.560]  great, he was a, you're talking about Obama, a great representative for like America and
[40:15.560 --> 40:22.520]  the world. And I think he just made like America look really great while he was in office.
[40:22.520 --> 40:27.120]  And I always wanted to hear what he had to say. Climate change. I mean, getting into
[40:27.120 --> 40:30.720]  the Paris Accord, well, it's good for the world and we're part of the world. And if
[40:30.720 --> 40:35.160]  we don't have climate change under control, we're all suffer. So he was looking out for
[40:35.160 --> 40:40.320]  the future and he did it against a lot of pressure. So I think that's the best thing
[40:40.320 --> 40:48.840]  he did. Well, number two, Obamacare. He created health insurance so everybody could have health
[40:48.840 --> 40:57.840]  insurance. He forced insurance companies to not be allowed to exclude you based on a prior
[40:57.840 --> 41:05.080]  illness or, you know, that is one of the biggest problems in insecurities in everybody's life
[41:05.080 --> 41:08.880]  is that health insurance and ability to get it. And if you are unlucky enough to have
[41:08.880 --> 41:17.280]  a disability of any kind, you don't get anything. And he made that turn around. That gave everybody
[41:17.280 --> 41:23.520]  security, everybody, like that is hands down. The best thing that Obama did was that health
[41:23.520 --> 41:29.840]  care initiative and making health insurance companies required to cover you regardless
[41:29.840 --> 41:39.400]  of a prior illness, prior diagnosis. I have two kids with special needs. We wouldn't get
[41:39.400 --> 41:51.160]  insurance with that. I'm gonna pass this on to Raelyn. Honestly, I just don't know what
[41:51.160 --> 41:57.520]  I'm sorry. I don't know anything about that. I think a lot of his I think he had some presidential
[41:57.520 --> 42:06.200]  what is it the office ones where you can presidential rights where he included like I think you
[42:06.200 --> 42:12.440]  can't discriminate by race, gender or sexual orientation. Like I feel like he changed that.
[42:12.440 --> 42:16.080]  I think I'm not sure. You know what I mean? You know what I'm talking about with the presidential
[42:16.080 --> 42:23.040]  orders, I think. So he was able to do that. But I think Trump changed that. He was there.
[42:23.040 --> 42:27.240]  He was present for like things that were going wrong in the community. What he was present
[42:27.240 --> 42:31.720]  for like, you know, tragedies and like you could see in his face, there's like clear
[42:31.720 --> 42:35.720]  empathy there. He like had an understanding. He empathize with people. So like, I felt
[42:35.720 --> 42:40.680]  like the moves that he made weren't necessarily made from like this bias of like, I need to
[42:40.680 --> 42:45.640]  be another pawn in this whole big game of chess and like move the pieces around. He's
[42:45.640 --> 42:51.080]  like, no, these are people. I need to care for people. And I think that do not feel like
[42:51.080 --> 42:54.720]  President Trump empathizes with black people or the black community. I don't feel like
[42:54.720 --> 43:02.400]  President Trump empathizes. Period. I think there's the builder group consists of over
[43:02.400 --> 43:07.880]  130 of the planet's most powerful people and it will meet in turn Italy from June 7th
[43:07.880 --> 43:13.240]  through 10th for the annual gathering behind closed doors. This year's topics include populism
[43:13.240 --> 43:18.960]  in Europe, the inequality challenge, the future of work, artificial intelligence, the US before
[43:18.960 --> 43:25.120]  midterms, Russia, of course, and the post truth world. Now, this is where CNBC covers
[43:25.120 --> 43:29.800]  the builder group with the headline, the secret of builder verge elite are worried about the
[43:29.800 --> 43:34.880]  post truth world. This is the mainstream media who once pretended the group didn't exist.
[43:34.880 --> 43:38.680]  Now that they're finally reporting on builder verge, they're claiming the group is benevolent
[43:38.680 --> 43:43.720]  and cares about truth and objectivity while they meet in secret and take no minutes. This
[43:43.720 --> 43:48.600]  is more likely that the group will discuss ways to use this post truth world where feelings
[43:48.600 --> 43:53.560]  are more important than facts and reason to their advantage. Specifically, as it pertains
[43:53.560 --> 44:01.520]  to the US before midterm, Lee and McAdoo info wars dot com info wars life and info wars
[44:01.520 --> 44:07.600]  life dot com is extremely excited to announce our latest release. Winner's son, a revolutionary

[45:03.240 --> 45:08.440]  nation of Australia. You're on the air worldwide. Thanks for holding. Hey Alex mate. I've been
[45:08.440 --> 45:13.960]  following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now. I remember back when info wars and prison
[45:13.960 --> 45:19.200]  planet, it was just blue text on a white screen and it had to load down the page on my dial
[45:19.200 --> 45:23.560]  up internet and I thought it was pretty cool and read all the books and seen all the DVDs
[45:23.560 --> 45:27.560]  and followed all your guests and I've been using your product since the first iteration
[45:27.560 --> 45:33.120]  of survival shield and since then I'm on the X two, the super male vitality, the caveman,
[45:33.120 --> 45:38.560]  the real red pill, Mike Ozziak body. It's all amazing. Thank you brother. Yeah and I
[45:38.560 --> 45:43.120]  wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're
[45:43.120 --> 45:48.040]  detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit and it's just the more you know God, the more
[45:48.040 --> 45:52.800]  you fear God, but the more you chase God and I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand
[45:52.800 --> 46:02.200]  side by side with you, the crew and the listeners out there, 1776 worldwide. Western Europe has
[46:02.200 --> 46:08.640]  already banned free speech and an iron curtain of censorship is sending down over the UK.
[46:08.640 --> 46:14.320]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get
[46:14.320 --> 46:19.320]  six months in prison. We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the
[46:19.320 --> 46:24.120]  UK. Staying in and many others are calling for info wars to be shut down, taken off the
[46:24.120 --> 46:29.920]  web. Slate magazine has a professor and others saying go beyond censorship, brainwash young
[46:29.920 --> 46:35.600]  people against info wars. Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear
[46:35.600 --> 46:40.360]  what we have to say. We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists. It
[46:40.360 --> 46:45.520]  is so critical that you go to info wars.com, or slash newsletter and sign up for the free
[46:45.520 --> 46:50.400]  newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in
[46:50.400 --> 46:56.120]  and block us being able to engage in free, open dialogue as a society. That is critical
[46:56.120 --> 47:03.120]  to this fight. We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[47:26.120 --> 47:43.520]  Okay, we are going to air the video of all the mainstream news trying to demonize info
[47:43.520 --> 47:51.560]  wars, make a joke of info wars. Look at info wars. They're crazy. They think Trump's campaign
[47:51.560 --> 47:57.160]  was spied on. Oh, it's just like mainstream news, declassified documents, text messages
[47:57.160 --> 48:02.240]  from FBI agents, James Clapper admits it, they all admit it. Now they just say, oh,
[48:02.240 --> 48:10.040]  that's normal. But they don't retract their fake news. They don't apologize for demonizing
[48:10.040 --> 48:16.520]  us. Well, of course not. That was the agenda from the beginning. It wasn't to report news.
[48:16.520 --> 48:21.200]  It wasn't to give you facts. It was to demonize info wars. That was the entire purpose of
[48:21.200 --> 48:27.720]  that. So we'll have that that really just embarrasses the mainstream media. And we just hope that
[48:27.720 --> 48:33.680]  the public can realize they have a memory better than a goldfish and go back in time
[48:33.680 --> 48:43.800]  to just remember how it all went down. But here we are now and look at what we have today.
[48:43.800 --> 48:48.280]  Justice Department to show lawmakers classified materials on FBI source. Well, what does that
[48:48.280 --> 48:59.240]  mean? That means that the DOJ is going to show members of Congress, whatever they have,
[48:59.240 --> 49:09.120]  that is or was classified that shows the spies inside the Trump campaign. One, two, three,
[49:09.120 --> 49:16.360]  however many the details, the reports, who was behind it. Of course, adding fuel to that
[49:16.360 --> 49:27.480]  fire has to be the openness lures. That's outside the contiguous United States spies.
[49:27.480 --> 49:33.600]  In the redacted stroke page text messages are now suggesting multiple spies targeted
[49:33.600 --> 49:42.880]  multiple Trump officials. And Obama wanted updates on the entire thing. Oh, but info
[49:42.880 --> 49:50.680]  wars was wrong somehow, even though they were right. Then that shows you the true desperation.
[49:50.680 --> 49:58.800]  This Russia probe really is in which really is also spy gate. Spy gate became the Russia
[49:58.800 --> 50:06.760]  probe. That's basically what it was spy gate was to spy on Trump and then try to keep him
[50:06.760 --> 50:17.240]  out of office. Failed. Then spy gate became Russia gate. Failed. So now what does it
[50:17.240 --> 50:23.560]  become? Well, Robert Mueller is requesting that witnesses turn in their personal phones
[50:23.560 --> 50:30.080]  to inspect their encrypted messaging programs. Now, you won't you want to know what that
[50:30.080 --> 50:36.600]  means, folks? That means Mueller has nothing. That means Robert Mueller looking for Russian
[50:36.600 --> 50:42.840]  collusion or looking for anything really has nothing. And so now he's asking for cell phones
[50:42.840 --> 50:50.120]  because he's so desperate for anything and everything. No, he doesn't want to know why
[50:50.120 --> 50:56.560]  Nellie or was communicating via ham radio, the wife of Bruce or working under the Obama
[50:56.560 --> 51:05.280]  administration with fusion GPS to create a fake document dossier on Trump, which again,
[51:05.280 --> 51:13.200]  that was part of spy gate turning in to Russia gate. So then what happens? Now they say, and
[51:13.200 --> 51:20.720]  this is where you can actually start to understand better how operations like this come to fruition
[51:20.720 --> 51:25.840]  and how operatives get put in place. Former U.S. Attorney says Manafort will likely go
[51:25.840 --> 51:31.840]  to prison Friday. Well, who is this former U.S. Attorney? Well, it's Harry Littman. Where
[51:31.840 --> 51:38.520]  did Harry Littman go to school? Harvard Law. You're going to learn about Harvard. I have
[51:38.520 --> 51:45.400]  a feeling in the near future about what Harvard really is a CIA, deep state recruitment grounds,
[51:45.400 --> 51:49.560]  FBI recruitment grounds. That's that's what Harvard has become. Don't believe me? Look
[51:49.560 --> 51:52.920]  at all the deep state actors that come out of Harvard, folks. You wouldn't believe it.
[51:52.920 --> 51:58.160]  The judges, the president, Obama, Bush, all these judges. Here's another one, the Manafort
[51:58.160 --> 52:02.360]  tampering allegations. Special Counsel Robert Mueller has accused Paul Manafort of attempted
[52:02.360 --> 52:06.680]  witness tampering. No, that's what the Mueller investigation is doing. If the allegations
[52:06.680 --> 52:10.480]  are true, which they're not, Manafort will have violated the conditions of his release
[52:10.480 --> 52:15.480]  and might have his bail revoked. Judge Amy Berman Jackson has scheduled a hearing on
[52:15.480 --> 52:23.920]  the matter for late next week. Who's Amy Berman Jackson? Harvard Law grad Obama appointee.
[52:23.920 --> 52:32.160]  This is how these people work, folks. Then the stories on info wars.com from Steve Watson,
[52:32.160 --> 52:39.880]  retired Colonel Trump is made to order for seduction by Kremlin. I mean, this is, this
[52:39.880 --> 52:47.920]  is madness. Again, this is the desperate deep state throwing feces against the wall and
[52:47.920 --> 52:54.840]  calling it news. Now, here's an example of just arrested developments throwing feces
[52:54.840 --> 53:01.520]  at the wall. Stormy Daniels says her lawyer and Michael Cohen colluded to help Trump.
[53:01.520 --> 53:04.160]  So the porn star apparently hasn't gotten enough attention and enough money. She's
[53:04.160 --> 53:11.440]  going to continue to use Trump to market her porn tour and leave it to NBC News, Politico,
[53:11.440 --> 53:17.960]  CNN, MSNBC to make a national story of it and give her free publicity. A porn star is
[53:17.960 --> 53:23.800]  now smarter than all of the left wing media in America combined. Congratulations. Here's
[53:23.800 --> 53:28.600]  another example of arrested development flinging feces at the wall. Colin Kaepernick's legal
[53:28.600 --> 53:34.560]  team expected to subpoena President Trump in case against the NFL. You know, do you
[53:34.560 --> 53:39.280]  know, do you realize how ridiculous this is? Do you actually realize how ridiculous this
[53:39.280 --> 53:52.040]  is? Colin Kaepernick quit. He quit. How come everybody seems to ignore this? Why is Colin
[53:52.040 --> 53:56.200]  Kaepernick making a national case out of him not being able to get a job in the NFL when
[53:56.200 --> 54:04.320]  he quit? He quit. He had a year on his contract. He made $80 million. He quit. He walked away
[54:04.320 --> 54:13.400]  and then he bit his about President Trump. You quit. You quit. Excuse me. It's so ridiculous
[54:13.400 --> 54:17.200]  these people use Colin Kaepernick. They say, well, look at the NFL. Look at what Trump
[54:17.200 --> 54:27.160]  said to Colin Kaepernick. Look at the racism Colin Kaepernick. He quit. He quit. He quit.
[54:27.160 --> 54:32.880]  And then they have this whole story with the Eagles. And then you do more research into
[54:32.880 --> 54:38.520]  this. Look at what the Eagles did to President Trump. Originally, they send a message. We're
[54:38.520 --> 54:43.400]  going to send 70 people to the White House. Let's arrange the White House visit. White
[54:43.400 --> 54:48.760]  House says, great. Let's get it done. Arrange everything ready for 700 people, excuse me,
[54:48.760 --> 55:00.000]  70 people to show up. Two days before, two days before the Eagles get back in touch with
[55:00.000 --> 55:03.880]  the White House and say, we're only sending 10 people, only two players. Or excuse me,
[55:03.880 --> 55:12.680]  I think it was only one player, Nick Fultz. One player. And they all go for Obama, who
[55:12.680 --> 55:16.880]  was a total trader, total trash, but then they don't go for Trump. And then the media
[55:16.880 --> 55:23.320]  says, how dare Trump? This just shows you who Trump is. LeBron says, oh, I'm not surprised.
[55:23.320 --> 55:30.120]  He's a racist Trump. Of course he's going to do this. The Eagles set him up. The Eagles
[55:30.120 --> 55:34.520]  set him up and then bailed. And then they blame him because he doesn't want to waste
[55:34.520 --> 55:38.640]  his time with 10 Eagles, only one player. He says, you know what? I think I'd rather
[55:38.640 --> 55:44.680]  devote my time to members of the military that are real heroes of this nation. But the
[55:44.680 --> 55:51.720]  media, oh, how dare Trump? It doesn't matter that every championship team went for Obama.
[55:51.720 --> 55:54.120]  And then all of a sudden they just stopped going for Trump. He's not supposed to take
[55:54.120 --> 55:58.160]  that personally. It's his fault. Oh, and by the way, Colin Kaepernick took the first knee
[55:58.160 --> 56:06.200]  when Obama was president. Go back to that, though. You have this gentleman deciding to
[56:06.200 --> 56:14.440]  take a knee at the event that Trump posted for the veterans and for active duty military
[56:14.440 --> 56:24.680]  at the White House. The guy takes a knee. Can you imagine a more pathetic sap? I mean,
[56:24.680 --> 56:34.720]  how do you even explain that? Brainwashed idiot. That's how you explain that. So that's
[56:34.720 --> 56:42.960]  what you have going on today in America. Most incredible times ever. And it's just sad,
[56:42.960 --> 56:47.480]  I think that a lot of people have no idea how serious this stuff really is, have no
[56:47.480 --> 56:55.760]  idea the historic times they're living in. It's really just incredible. But here we are

[57:03.160 --> 57:09.520]  not because this fool takes a knee at the White House. No. It's all possible because

[57:15.280 --> 57:20.720]  this country. And then this broadcast is possible because of your support at infowordsstore.com.

[59:45.440 --> 59:50.600]  the word. Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:29.400]  Let me tell you something that has the criminals in this country that have been posing as politicians
[01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:38.560]  and media members running scared. It's because you are willing to stand up and confront them.
[01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:43.840]  Now this next video clip I'm about to go to is incredible on so many different levels.
[01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:50.640]  This is a man who showed up at Bill Clinton's book signing tour, which we are having a Bill
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:56.840]  Clinton protest here, a Me Too Bill Clinton protest Sunday evening, 6 p.m. Central outside
[01:00:56.840 --> 01:01:02.200]  Bass Concert Hall this Sunday in Austin, Texas, outside of Bill Clinton's book speaking
[01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:07.720]  tour, hashtag Me Too protest outside Bass Concert Hall this Sunday, 6 p.m. Central. Hope I can
[01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:14.520]  see you there. I'll be there. This is why they're panicking right now. This is why they're
[01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:20.440]  scared because the average human, the average American is willing to stand up, willing to
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:29.720]  confront the corruption face to face. Now you remember the Bill Clinton is a rapist contest
[01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:34.840]  that went viral and was all over mainstream television news. Now we're doing the same
[01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:43.440]  thing to his book tour and look at this most recent clip where a man confronts Bill Clinton
[01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:50.960]  inside a crowded theater over his trips on the Lolita Express. Why didn't you fly on
[01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:58.760]  Jeffrey Epstein's Lolita Express 26 times? 26 times, Bill. What were you doing on Jeffrey
[01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:07.320]  Epstein's plane? He knows James Patterson knows who Jeffrey Epstein is. Now pause it
[01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:13.040]  right here. I want to explain something about this video that's potentially the most incredible
[01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:19.840]  thing to me. This is a crowded theater, an entire hall full of people, hundreds of people
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:26.880]  here it looks like, to see Bill Clinton and hear him speak. And here's one individual,
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:32.800]  the only individual in that entire crowd that's truly alive, the only individual amongst the
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:39.280]  brainwashed sheeple that can still think. And the reason I say that, you'll understand
[01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:44.840]  later in this video, watch as he continues to confront Bill Clinton over his 26 trips
[01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:50.640]  on the Lolita Express, which by the way, dozens of which more than a dozen times he ditched
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:57.640]  secret service to go on that plane. Why would he do that? Let's go back to the clip.
[01:02:57.640 --> 01:03:26.640]  You wrote a book on Jeff, 26 times, Bill. You didn't investigate it. You didn't investigate
[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:33.640]  it. Let's go. You didn't investigate it. Look it up. Jeffrey Epstein. Who cares? Yeah. Yeah.
[01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:52.640]  We know Bill. We know Bill. Yeah, have a good time, folks. Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:57.640]  All right. There's another part on the in there that I wanted to get where he's walking out
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:04:02.640]  and the guy's like, Oh, you're insane. You're insane. Can we get that? Is that possible
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:10.640]  to get? Play it. Play the end real quick. This is key. We know, Bill. We know, Bill.
[01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:20.640]  Come on. Yeah, have a good time, folks. Bill Clinton and Kevin Spacey. Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:29.640]  So, Clinton's are friends with Spacey, Epstein, Weinstein. What's that? You're acting insane.
[01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:33.640]  Okay, so at the end there, the guy's like, you're acting insane. You're acting insane.
[01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:38.640]  He's the only one in the crowd that's not insane. He's the only one in the crowd that has a brain.
[01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:41.640]  He's the only one in the crowd that has the ability to think critically and freely.
[01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:46.640]  Everyone else in that crowd is a brainwashed minion. He's the only one that's still alive.
[01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:51.640]  And what do they do? They point the finger at him and say, you're insane. You're insane.
[01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:57.640]  No, dude. He's the last of you left that's still alive. Incredible.
[01:04:57.640 --> 01:05:04.640]  I want to plow into all of this. I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:10.640]  listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books
[01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:17.640]  or videos or other material from infowarstore.com, you are funding the revolution.

[01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:26.640]  There's a guy on the radio. His name is Alex Jones. Alex Jones. Alex Jones is the most
[01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:31.640]  in the world. That man to say you watch your mouth. Time to stop submitting to this parody.
[01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:36.640]  It's time to realize that we're being enslaved. I heard that on Alex Jones. Infowars, it's a
[01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:48.140]  boost by Alex Jones. We are in an information war, and we are losing that war. Nobody can
[01:06:48.140 --> 01:06:47.640]  després the fact that you're a wretch. infowars.
[01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:54.140]  infowars.com Info wars comes to mind. info wars.
[01:06:54.140 --> 01:06:52.320]  infowars. wpotn Girls News
[01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:58.640]  You watch in headache. info wars. infowars. infowars.
[01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:02.960]  Info ours. I want freedom. That's what I want an application.
[01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:10.960]  Hello, this is Hank Hill, and I'm telling you what, you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:12.960]  I like that guy.
[01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:13.960]  That is the best.
[01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:20.960]  From the front lines of the Information Ward, it's Alex Jones.
[01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:32.960]  Coming in for Alex Jones, I am your host today, Owen Schroyer, and I am about to be joined by Reverend Clinard Childress of BlackGenocide.org. And I'm glad that Reverend Childress was able to join me today.
[01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:39.960]  You see, last Friday, we had a protest here in Austin, Texas, where we protested Planned Parenthood.
[01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:42.960]  We're going to schedule another one a few months down the road.
[01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:45.960]  We're going to try to get better numbers at this next time.
[01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:56.960]  But aside from the fact that, you know, I would just like to see innocent lives and innocent babies stood up for, someone has to stand up for them.
[01:07:56.960 --> 01:08:05.960]  It's also worth pointing out the double standard here, where the left cries for the children anytime there's a mass school shooting, which of course, nobody wants to see that.
[01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:10.960]  But if you're going to virtually signal for children, why don't you stand against Planned Parenthood?
[01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:19.960]  Or better yet, if you're going to chant Black Lives Matter and have a bunch of protests for Black Lives Matter, again, why do you ignore Planned Parenthood?
[01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:25.960]  And Reverend Clinard Childress has tried to tackle this issue with his website, blackgenocide.org.
[01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:29.960]  Reverend, thank you for joining me today.
[01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:46.960]  Well, we're glad to have you here. And one of the main things that you find as soon as you go to blackgenocide.org is the fact that one in two black women in the United States will abort their baby, especially in New York City.
[01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:51.960]  This is something that seems to go completely ignored by Black Lives Matter.
[01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:56.960]  Do those lives not matter to them, Reverend Childress? I'm just trying to figure this out.
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:09:08.960]  Well, honestly, they don't really matter. And the great thing about this is because of programming like this and others, Candace Owens recently is doing a great job getting the word out.
[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:14.960]  And certainly they're beginning to put groups like this under the microscope.
[01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:26.960]  It's really an exciting time right now for me watching this trend where they're being challenged. The use of Kanye West is certainly something I would have never predicted.
[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:48.960]  But what it is, it's causing African Americans in the urban areas to really look at the agenda of past presidents and really recognize that much of the policies of the party unquestionably were very detrimental and literally disseminating the African American community.
[01:09:48.960 --> 01:10:00.960]  So I'm excited about what's going on. And this decimation is going to stop 1,786 African American children are killed each day by abortion.
[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:15.960]  Those numbers are beginning to drop now. Thank God. But as through awareness, you know, Scripture says my people are destroyed because of a lack of knowledge and nothing more truer when it comes to the issue of abortion.
[01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:26.960]  And as a political issue, we can have a debate on abortion all day long. And I think it's a fair debate to have. However, I don't think there is a debate when it comes to the government funding abortion.
[01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:33.960]  I don't think there should be a debate when it comes to the government funding Planned Parenthood. To me, this is a no brainer. That's illegal.
[01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:54.960]  Now, they say they earmark those dollars for other services. But give me a break. 75% of Planned Parenthood funding comes from the government and they abort millions of children a year. So whether or not they have that $1 they got from the government, 75% of their funding, whether or not they choose to put that into the, let's say, soda machine to get the soda, it doesn't matter.
[01:10:54.960 --> 01:11:00.960]  They just save that dollar to use another dollar to put in the soda machine. So it's really a false narrative to me.
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:18.960]  No question. It's corruption. There's no question about that. And I thank God for this president, Donald Trump, beginning to deal with that issue of defunding Planned Parenthood, even so much so as to the tune of $545 million that their major business is abortion.
[01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:35.960]  They're the leading abortion provider in the country. And undoubtedly, I think women need to recognize that the health ramifications from this are so detrimental and so destructive, yet there's not even a discussion.
[01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:50.960]  We're heading out the San Antonio soon at the NAACP conference because this discussion on the health ramifications is not being talked about inside their forum, which is gross negligence of the highest regard.
[01:11:50.960 --> 01:12:11.960]  So we're right now seeing the message of black genocide and its source abortion coming to the forefront of discussion. It's not there yet, but it's been a lot of good things have been happening. And as you stated earlier in the program, 52% of all African-American pregnancies end in abortion.
[01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:29.960]  But people are profiting from that. We've had too many incidences, basically, where they have been verified. Not only is Planned Parenthood collaborating with human trafficking, but they're profiting off of body parts.
[01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:48.960]  So I think Kevin O'Keefe's basically ability to get in there and film that was very powerful. And I'm grateful for the fact that the matter is that these things are rising to the forefront where we begin to say, well, if you're going to talk about Planned Parenthood, you got to talk about this.
[01:12:48.960 --> 01:13:06.960]  And I also want to say, and I watched a program where you were heading out there to Austin when you were announcing and the pictures that you were carrying, I thought was very apropos, very, very important for this present day society because our millennials unquestionably.
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:22.960]  The last thing you want to call them is racist. But yet, the organization itself was founded by one of the most renowned racists of our time, Margaret Sanger, who was a white supremacist, clearly.
[01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:34.960]  And we'll take on that debate anywhere in the world. And certainly they don't want that debate. So when I heard you saw that you were carrying that picture out there, let's have a discussion about this.
[01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:46.960]  If these is the mindset of the abortion industry and where they've already come, she's already commented that colored people are like human weeds and they need to be exterminated.
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:14:03.960]  It's not about family planning. It's about eugenics. It's about basically trying to eliminate those whom you feel are not redeemable. Those who you feel are not suitable in your scope of what life is.
[01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:18.960]  That is so dangerous. But yet we had a president, Barack Obama, who was basically encouraging African Americans to look at Planned Parenthood as a viable means for an unwanted pregnancy.
[01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:41.960]  So we're turning the corner. I'm just excited about Donald Trump. I didn't expect this to be so clearly a pro-life president as he has become right now. The grassroots things that you were doing prior are so important because it keeps the discussion on the forefront of the burners of our lives.
[01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:45.960]  And we have to discuss these things if we're ever going to end.
[01:14:45.960 --> 01:15:00.960]  Well, I completely agree. And having the discussion can at least get some of the truth and some of these details out there to some of the people who may have stubborn minds and hardened heads, but just continuing to push it out there to eventually permeate.
[01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:11.960]  Now, I got a couple things I want to get into you on the other side, the NAACP, and then the key about the eugenics of Planned Parenthood, really, that needs to be discussed.
[01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:20.960]  But before I get to that with Reverend Shielders on the other side, folks, please support us at InfowarsStore.com. As he was talking about, we're trying to do more. We want to do more grassroots protests.

[01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:39.960]  How many did I insult? I killed my kids. I killed my kids. What the f**k is this? It's a fake f**king veil that doesn't stand for women's rights.
[01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:51.960]  Hey we saw your Facebook with your communist hammer and sickle. That's pretty cool man. Is that you on the Facebook? Is there a Facebook page of you with a hammer and sickle?
[01:20:51.960 --> 01:21:10.960]  I don't think so. I go on your Twitter, I f**king love Facebook. How do you get your abortion faceless? I pay for them. Upwards of 50. Really? Oh yeah.
[01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:40.760]  Well, that's the type of stuff we capture when we
[01:21:40.760 --> 01:21:45.320]  go out and go to these protests or have a protest of Planned Parenthood, which we're
[01:21:45.320 --> 01:21:51.480]  planning one soon, bigger than the one we did last Friday. We're going to get the details
[01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:56.200]  on that as we plan it probably a month or two away. In the meantime though, Reverend
[01:21:56.200 --> 01:22:00.920]  Leonard Childress joins me, blackgenocide.org is his website where you can find all of his
[01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:06.480]  work. Now there's two things I want to get into with you here in this segment, but the
[01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:13.480]  most important to me is the eugenics of Margaret Sanger. Now I have a story here in front of
[01:22:13.480 --> 01:22:21.000]  me from Zero Hedge. Opioids are responsible for 20% of millennial deaths. Crisis will
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:27.760]  impact U.S. for generations. Well, okay, people need to understand that's one aspect of a eugenics
[01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:34.560]  population control program. Now you combine that with what the Planned Parenthoods of
[01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:39.520]  the world are doing at their abortuaries and all the abortions, you're looking at my generation
[01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:48.040]  of millennials losing about 30 to 40% of our population. That's about 40% of people my
[01:22:48.040 --> 01:22:55.880]  age, my generation either killed by big pharmaceutical companies or killed by Planned Parenthood.
[01:22:55.880 --> 01:23:00.600]  Now you've seen the Georgia Guidestones. We've told you about population control. You've
[01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:07.440]  heard of eugenics. You know about eugenics. Why do people just ignore the signs that are
[01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:13.320]  right in front of them, Reverend Childress, of the actual population control eugenics
[01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:17.240]  program that's going on?
[01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:23.520]  You raise a very good point and even in the montage you showed prior to coming back on
[01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:30.640]  here, you see the anger from the other side, which is also a sense of us that we should
[01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:35.800]  stay encouraged actually. What do I mean? Because if abortion is so good and it's so
[01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:41.800]  great and it's so wonderful, they get so upset when they actually see it. Why? Because they're
[01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:47.760]  a person of conscience. And what the church and activists and like-minded people have
[01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:54.920]  to recognize, we must appeal to conscience and that conscience certainly stays with
[01:23:54.920 --> 01:24:01.320]  them long after our demonstration and this is why we're getting the shift in the culture
[01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:06.520]  that we actually need and it's really bringing to light the simple fact of that. That is
[01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:14.160]  a baby, 18 days, there's a heartbeat, 42 days, there's brainwaves, 68 days, the child is
[01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:22.960]  sucking their thumb. That's a person which is protected. Dr. Martin Luther King basically
[01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:29.720]  laid the foundation of the civil rights movement based on we hold these truths to be self-evident
[01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:36.280]  that all mankind is created equal and endowed by the Creator with certain unalienable rights
[01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:41.280]  among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. First, I'm endowed by the Creator,
[01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:47.680]  not my mother or my father. I'm endowed by the Creator. So if they're making a bad decision,
[01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:55.120]  they have basically circumvented my right to the American dream, my right to pursue life.
[01:24:55.120 --> 01:25:02.760]  Whether I'd be born poor or born an orphan or whatever the occasion, the Declaration
[01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:09.480]  of Independence says I deserve that right to pursue and pursue implies that I may not
[01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:17.000]  have it or it is not in my grasp but you can't take away the right for me to pursue happiness
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:24.680]  and that's going on. You mentioned the decimation, 20 million African Americans are missing just
[01:25:24.680 --> 01:25:29.760]  due by abortion alone. We're not going to talk about AIDS, we're not going to talk about
[01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:35.760]  heart disease or cancer. If you add all those things up, accidents, it doesn't even come
[01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:44.440]  to nearly half of the amount that has been killed by abortion. So rightfully put, this
[01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:52.160]  is a decimation of a generation that unquestionably is being targeted. Abortion has been the most
[01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:59.520]  successful means of diminishing the African American community and children and as Reverend
[01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:06.800]  Hunter, our national director would say nobody knows whose womb holds the chief but we don't
[01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:13.600]  know how many inventions we have destroyed because we destroyed the seed. There is repercussions
[01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:21.440]  that probably go unnoticed and unfocused upon but no doubt we're praying that this
[01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:30.080]  Holocaust would soon end and those gifts will be allowed to be here to bless us to hopefully
[01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:36.760]  change the society that we live out the dream that Dr. King saw that we, the sons of former
[01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:42.080]  slaves and the sons of former slave owners are sitting at the table of brotherhood. He
[01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:49.520]  said that in 1963 and he said one day we would get to that land in 1968, the night before
[01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:55.120]  his death, he said I would not get there with you but one day we will get to the promised
[01:26:55.120 --> 01:27:03.040]  land as a people. So this very may well may be that season and if it is that season abortion
[01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:08.560]  rovers his way would have to be overturned and everyone would have the right to pursue
[01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:14.440]  the American dream. Right now there's a segment of our society that's being denied access
[01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:21.520]  to the American dream and that's the unborn and anyone with a civil rights spirit in them,
[01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:26.480]  it's really a Holy Spirit move but we'll call it civil rights for the sake of argument would
[01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:32.440]  be addressing that segment of our society that's being denied their right to the American
[01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:37.400]  dream. Now we've just got 60 seconds left here but I was just curious you mentioned
[01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:45.000]  the NAACP earlier are they cooperating with you right now? No the joint board I want to
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:51.120]  say this the joint board the NAACP has received marching orders in no way form of fashion
[01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:56.920]  allowed this even to come in for discussion. They break their own rules when they deny
[01:27:56.920 --> 01:28:02.400]  chapters who agree with us that this should at least be a discussion. They will not allow
[01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:07.440]  those resolutions even to be read. So all this information I'm giving you or sharing
[01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:14.120]  in this short period of time is not even mentioned in NAAC conferences. Now how can
[01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:22.200]  that be when 52% of the women are based of the African American community are experiencing
[01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:28.480]  an abortion? It is the most performed operation on a woman in general and disproportionately
[01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:35.360]  African American. How can you not have that discussion at the NAACP conference? So we'll
[01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:40.440]  be there once again on the outside making that case. It is changing. Many people are
[01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:46.600]  saying we're right. The constituency is the joint board that is basically drawn the line
[01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:52.040]  because of their affiliation with Planned Parenthood and the far left. Alright Reverend
[01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:54.680]  Schilder thank you so much we got to take a break. Thank you so much for joining us

[01:32:07.280 --> 01:32:12.960]  to detoxify the body. That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense
[01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:18.880]  Support. It's made in the USA. It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely
[01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:23.800]  associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the infowar. It is a classical 360
[01:32:23.800 --> 01:32:28.080]  win. This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we

[01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:37.440]  get. You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of
[01:32:37.440 --> 01:32:42.440]  this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as
[01:32:42.440 --> 01:32:47.720]  you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires
[01:32:47.720 --> 01:32:51.600]  the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be. Thanks to your support and
[01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:55.520]  your prayers together, we're changing the world. Now it's time to change our bodies.
[01:32:55.520 --> 01:33:01.840]  With Z-Shield, InfowarsLife.com.
[01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:08.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:21.000]  And now, the tip of the spear. Leading the fight to take back the nation. It's Olin Troyer.
[01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:27.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:34.240]  There's a reason why they talk about Infowars unlike any other. That's because we're a news
[01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:40.320]  organization unlike any other. So they have to talk about us, but more importantly, they
[01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:47.160]  have to create a false narrative about us so that when somebody who's unfamiliar with
[01:33:47.160 --> 01:33:53.280]  our work comes across us for the first time, they already have that subconscious subliminal
[01:33:53.280 --> 01:34:00.280]  messaging built into their head where they discount our information prima facie instead
[01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:04.120]  of actually learning what we're about, learning what we're saying, do the investigating for
[01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:10.360]  ourselves. So that's what this propaganda is about. But look at how desperate it is
[01:34:10.360 --> 01:34:17.360]  where we accurately report that President Trump's campaign was spied on. Then they report it.
[01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:23.160]  Then we double down on the reporting saying, see, we told you so. Then they retreat and
[01:34:23.160 --> 01:34:29.840]  say, wait, we didn't say that. We never said that he was spied on. In fact, you're crazy
[01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:34.680]  for saying he's spied on. And then you say, well, no, here's Clapper saying it. Here's
[01:34:34.680 --> 01:34:40.840]  the documents. Here's you admitting it. And then they say, okay, well, it wasn't a spy.
[01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:48.000]  And so this is how their propaganda works. This is how they're losing in a real debate
[01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:53.720]  as far as the behavior when it comes to the Obama administration spying on President Trump.
[01:34:53.720 --> 01:34:59.720]  So look at this compilation that we have put together of all the mainstream news attacking
[01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:03.360]  info wars for reporting the truth.
[01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:09.880]  Republicans, you're the Alex Jones party. There is literally nothing too stupid and
[01:35:09.880 --> 01:35:14.640]  conspiratorial that you will not swallow. Some tweeted terrible just found out that
[01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:20.160]  Obama had my wires tapped in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is
[01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:25.320]  McCarthyism. And other one, how low has President Obama gone to tap my phones during the very
[01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:26.960]  sacred election process?
[01:35:26.960 --> 01:35:30.200]  And this weekend, we saw another example of that when White House Counselor Kellyanne
[01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:35.160]  Conway was asked if she had any proof for Trump's outlandish claim that Obama wiretapped
[01:35:35.160 --> 01:35:38.400]  him during the campaign and offered this bizarre answer.
[01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:43.440]  How does he know that his phone was actually tapped? Let me answer that globally. He's
[01:35:43.440 --> 01:35:47.040]  the president of the United States. He has information and intelligence that the rest
[01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:48.040]  of us do not.
[01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:52.640]  He is suggesting a U.S. president enlisted a foreign intelligence service to spy on
[01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:55.160]  a political adversary. That is an explosive charge.
[01:35:55.160 --> 01:35:59.960]  This is a serious allegation. This might be the most serious allegation any president
[01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:01.960]  has made against a previous president.
[01:36:01.960 --> 01:36:06.720]  But this is a very serious allegation for a sitting president to make about his predecessor.
[01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:11.760]  The craziest thing about Trump calling for an investigation without any evidence, zero
[01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:14.160]  evidence. Trump has not produced a shred of evidence.
[01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:16.240]  There was no evidence for Trump's claims.
[01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:17.960]  There was evidence did not come.
[01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:22.000]  So where did Trump get his info? From the CIA? From the FBI?
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.080]  Where are you getting this information?
[01:36:24.080 --> 01:36:26.080]  From a very reputable source.
[01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:28.080]  What? The FBI? The CIA?
[01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:33.080]  Info wars. It's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones. You know he's legit.
[01:36:33.080 --> 01:36:38.240]  This bizarre circular thing happening where the president cites a theory that he was wiretapped
[01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:43.600]  which developed on this kind of fringe right wing media. And then after his tweet storm
[01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:46.920]  info wars then started saying well look it was the New York Times that reported it citing
[01:36:46.920 --> 01:36:52.320]  our story, misreading our story. And now a few weeks later the White House and the president
[01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:57.860]  are citing info wars. So they've got one kind of bizarre right wing friend theory to defend
[01:36:57.860 --> 01:37:00.080]  another bizarre right wing friend theory.
[01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:05.760]  The crazier it gets the more they like it. That's their jam.
[01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:13.800]  Now how do you explain this? They say no evidence. Colbert, no evidence. Kimmel, no evidence.
[01:37:13.800 --> 01:37:20.280]  All the li- Are they that stupid? I mean genuinely you have to ask yourself this. Are they that
[01:37:20.280 --> 01:37:25.520]  stupid? Are they that bought and paid for? Are they that ignorant? Do they just read
[01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:29.240]  what's on the teleprompter? Do they really have no idea what they're talking about? They'll
[01:37:29.240 --> 01:37:33.120]  literally say anything. They're the fake news.
[01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:40.760]  How do you explain it? They first report it. Wiretapping of Trump. We report it. Then they
[01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:44.480]  say it never happened. We report it again. Then they say it did happen but it wasn't
[01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:49.680]  spying. We report it again. Then they say Trump is crazy. He gets his news from info wars
[01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:54.080]  even though they're admitting that our news was accurate. I mean seriously this is like
[01:37:54.080 --> 01:38:03.840]  beyond 1984. This is beyond Twilight Zone. This is real life. Stooges like Kimmel, Colbert,
[01:38:03.840 --> 01:38:12.320]  John Oliver. Stooges who are either the most ignorant people on television or literally
[01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:17.800]  are knowingly lying to you. Now it's up to you to make that decision for yourself. Now
[01:38:17.800 --> 01:38:24.360]  Dan Lyman joins me from info wars Europe's base out there where he is covering the Bilderberg
[01:38:24.360 --> 01:38:28.760]  meetings that are happening in Turin, Italy. We're going to get to that in the next segment
[01:38:28.760 --> 01:38:35.440]  with Dan Lyman. Dan, how do you react to this? How do you respond to this? It's like unbelievable.
[01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:43.320]  They say no evidence. We have the text messages now unredacted O'Connor's lures. They admit
[01:38:43.320 --> 01:38:48.160]  they had spies. I mean it's right there. Obama wanted everything. We have all the evidence.
[01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:51.840]  Literally we have all the evidence and they just say oh no you don't. You don't have any
[01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:53.600]  evidence. This never happened.
[01:38:53.600 --> 01:38:59.280]  You can draw a correlation between this and Bilderberg which is going on right now which
[01:38:59.280 --> 01:39:04.080]  not too long ago pretty much everyone in the mainstream media ridiculed any of us. We even
[01:39:04.080 --> 01:39:09.600]  dared to talk about it as it was being completely, it didn't exist. And as we know Alex is one
[01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:13.880]  of the first people that really exposed that and info wars has covered it year in and year
[01:39:13.880 --> 01:39:19.520]  out and now it's a mainstream thing. They have a website. They announced their attendance.
[01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:24.880]  They have mainstream media figureheads inside these meetings. It's now a known thing. So
[01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:28.720]  I can't help but think of this famous quote, first they ignore you then they laugh at you
[01:39:28.720 --> 01:39:33.040]  then they fight you and then you win. I think we're around the fight stage. So are we going
[01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:36.720]  to win next? I think that's kind of we're in that transition right now.
[01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:42.880]  And I guess it really just depends on the American public. But the average citizen, I mean they're
[01:39:42.880 --> 01:39:47.920]  not trying to be insulting their victims of the you know the screen time, the drugs, the
[01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:52.840]  chemicals in the food and water but it's like does the average American have enough thought
[01:39:52.840 --> 01:40:00.800]  capacity left, have enough logic left to see the lies or do they just take it for what
[01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:05.120]  it is? Oh I saw John Oliver. He said info wars is a joke Trump's stupid. So I believe
[01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:11.680]  it. Does the average American now have enough critical thinking to understand that they're
[01:40:11.680 --> 01:40:16.560]  being lied to? That's the question. Can they still read? Do they still have a memory? That's
[01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:22.720]  the real thing. Can the average American still read and do they have a memory left?
[01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:26.640]  That's a good question. I think what's happening right now when we see this across the West
[01:40:26.640 --> 01:40:31.160]  in Europe with the populist surge and then of course with what's going on in North America
[01:40:31.160 --> 01:40:36.400]  is there were a lot of people who would call themselves either centrists or disengaged or
[01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:43.160]  didn't pay attention to the news or whatever. And I think that that center area is becoming
[01:40:43.160 --> 01:40:48.680]  definitively divided between people who can wake up and accept the fact that we're being
[01:40:48.680 --> 01:40:54.280]  lied to. They might not be like fully engaged like you know info wars listeners but the
[01:40:54.280 --> 01:40:58.920]  middle ground which I've called kind of collateral damage in this info war and this war basically
[01:40:58.920 --> 01:41:04.760]  for you know the future of civilization. That line is dividing down the middle and you have
[01:41:04.760 --> 01:41:09.480]  rabid crazies on the left and then you have a lot of other folks who are pushing over
[01:41:09.480 --> 01:41:14.960]  it just into the realm of seeking truth and looking for answers to questions that maybe
[01:41:14.960 --> 01:41:19.680]  never even pops into their head until people like Kanye West and Elon Musk are putting
[01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:24.040]  out these bombshell statements into the world where it's like wow there's a mass awakening
[01:41:24.040 --> 01:41:29.480]  happening but it is dividing people pretty aggressively at this point. Yeah I mean even
[01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:35.640]  Kim Kardashian you know tweeting out her thank you for Trump pardoning her friend or whatever
[01:41:35.640 --> 01:41:39.720]  I mean even that I think freaks some of the left out. It's funny though they accept that
[01:41:39.720 --> 01:41:42.720]  and then they hate him for everything else. I mean literally you can see people on Twitter
[01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:48.040]  saying oh this Trump did good here but everything else he does is bad. You know Kim Kardashian
[01:41:48.040 --> 01:41:53.320]  good everything else Trump does is bad. But this is like let's say let's say media matters
[01:41:53.320 --> 01:41:57.840]  I'm gonna do an analogy here. Let's say media matters after this segment goes and prints
[01:41:57.840 --> 01:42:04.480]  a story that says Dan Lyman joins Infowars to report live on the Bilderberg conference
[01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:08.840]  and then we come out and we say Dan Lyman was never on Infowars live today. What are
[01:42:08.840 --> 01:42:11.960]  you talking about? And then they show the segment and they're like here's Dan Lyman
[01:42:11.960 --> 01:42:15.200]  on Infowars. We're saying well you know maybe he was on Infowars. He wasn't talking about
[01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:17.920]  Bilderberg though. There was no discussion of Bilderberg. He wasn't reporting on Bilderberg
[01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:21.480]  and they're like okay no here he is talking about Bilderberg and we're like well he wasn't
[01:42:21.480 --> 01:42:25.440]  really reporting on it. We were just kind of chatting about it just mulling around about
[01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:29.520]  it. That's what they're saying. I mean that's what they're saying with the spy gate issue.
[01:42:29.520 --> 01:42:34.320]  We've got all the evidence. Clapper admits it. It's in the declassified text messages.
[01:42:34.320 --> 01:42:38.240]  They say and then they say oh we were spying on him for his own protection his own good
[01:42:38.240 --> 01:42:42.600]  yet they didn't tell President Trump and they weren't spying on Hillary Clinton whose emails
[01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:50.040]  and classified servers were actually compromised. So I mean it's all so fake. I'm just hoping
[01:42:50.040 --> 01:42:54.120]  and wondering still if the average American can even soak it all in and sort it all out.
[01:42:54.120 --> 01:43:01.760]  We'll be right back.
[01:43:01.760 --> 01:43:06.720]  Years ago Infowars Life created the powerful Mycos the X formula to help you combat internal
[01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:11.120]  yeast. As the years went on and more toxins were pumped into the environment our team
[01:43:11.120 --> 01:43:15.600]  knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health. Mycos the

[01:43:57.280 --> 01:44:01.760]  While the builder burgers secretly meet this week to discuss the future of work McDonald's
[01:44:01.760 --> 01:44:06.600]  has announced it has a new way of building burgers without workers. The company announced
[01:44:06.600 --> 01:44:12.480]  it would replace cashiers with self service kiosks in all its American restaurants by
[01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:17.040]  2020. This is seen as a pushback move against the left's demands for $15 an hour minimum
[01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:22.520]  wage. CEO Steve Easterbrook said the decision is aimed at modernizing the company and adding
[01:44:22.520 --> 01:44:27.920]  more choice than variety to how customers order and receive their food. In reality McDonald's
[01:44:27.920 --> 01:44:32.600]  decision to add kiosk and mobile services to its business model is a reaction to the
[01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:37.440]  free market which has made these tech platforms more convenient for customers and cheaper
[01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:42.880]  for companies. Democrats and socialists like Bernie Sanders have tried to sell $15 an hour
[01:44:42.880 --> 01:44:48.280]  minimum wage as a solution to low wages but as info wars has reported forcing companies
[01:44:48.280 --> 01:44:54.480]  to hike wages by government decree would only wipe out entry level jobs not produce more.

[01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:03.520]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is. The real drama can be found
[01:45:03.520 --> 01:45:08.600]  here in Lailania states but a lot of us on the big island rely on rain water and we need
[01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:15.160]  to be concerned about ash and acid rain. Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles
[01:45:15.160 --> 01:45:20.440]  and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels. To find out we employed
[01:45:20.440 --> 01:45:26.720]  a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity and pH. What we learned was that there was
[01:45:26.720 --> 01:45:32.280]  in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rain water. Next we tested
[01:45:32.280 --> 01:45:37.360]  the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within
[01:45:37.360 --> 01:45:44.160]  safe measure but the pH was also restored to optimal levels. As it turns out the filter
[01:45:44.160 --> 01:45:49.800]  on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water. So what we've learned is that volcanic ash
[01:45:49.800 --> 01:45:55.240]  and acid rain can contaminate a rain water supply. But more importantly a good water
[01:45:55.240 --> 01:46:01.040]  filtration system will purify it. As the years go by it gets harder and harder to keep up
[01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:05.920]  with your body's nutritional needs. With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients and
[01:46:05.920 --> 01:46:10.680]  stress you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins
[01:46:10.680 --> 01:46:16.200]  and minerals needed daily. That's why infowars life created the powerful vitamin mineral

[01:47:01.920 --> 01:47:20.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening
[01:47:20.920 --> 01:47:36.480]  to the Alex Jones show. Well if you are listening to the likes of Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel,
[01:47:36.480 --> 01:47:43.520]  John Oliver or Bill Maher to get news and information, you have been fooled, you have
[01:47:43.520 --> 01:47:52.160]  been bamboozled, you have been lied to. Don't believe me? Look at the fake news reporters
[01:47:52.160 --> 01:47:53.160]  for yourself.
[01:47:53.160 --> 01:47:59.800]  Now Republicans, you're the Alex Jones party. There is literally nothing too stupid and
[01:47:59.800 --> 01:48:05.000]  conspiratorial that you will not swallow. Some tweeted terrible just found out that Obama
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:10.920]  had my wires tapped in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism
[01:48:10.920 --> 01:48:15.760]  and the other one, how low has President Obama gone to tap my phones during the very sacred
[01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:16.920]  election process?
[01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:20.160]  And this weekend we saw another example of that when White House Counselor Kellyanne
[01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:25.080]  Conway was asked if she had any proof for Trump's outlandish claim that Obama wiretapped
[01:48:25.080 --> 01:48:28.320]  him during the campaign and offered this bizarre answer.
[01:48:28.320 --> 01:48:31.480]  How does he know that his phone was actually tapped?
[01:48:31.480 --> 01:48:36.000]  Let me answer that globally. He's the President of the United States. He has information and
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:37.960]  intelligence that the rest of us do not.
[01:48:37.960 --> 01:48:42.640]  He is suggesting a U.S. President enlisted a foreign intelligence service to spy on a
[01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:45.040]  political adversary. That is the explosive charge.
[01:48:45.040 --> 01:48:49.880]  This is a serious allegation. This might be the most serious allegation any President
[01:48:49.880 --> 01:48:52.080]  has made against a previous President.
[01:48:52.080 --> 01:48:56.640]  But this is a very serious allegation for a sitting President to make about his predecessor.
[01:48:56.640 --> 01:49:01.480]  The craziest thing about Trump calling for an investigation without any evidence, zero
[01:49:01.480 --> 01:49:04.000]  evidence, Trump has not produced a shred of evidence.
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:07.920]  There was no evidence for Trump's claims. There was evidence did not come.
[01:49:07.920 --> 01:49:11.920]  So where did Trump get his info? From the CIA? From the FBI?
[01:49:11.920 --> 01:49:14.040]  Where are you getting this information?
[01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:16.040]  From a very reputable source.
[01:49:16.040 --> 01:49:18.040]  What? The FBI? The CIA?
[01:49:18.040 --> 01:49:21.200]  Infowars. It's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones.
[01:49:21.200 --> 01:49:23.000]  You know he's legit.
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:28.200]  This bizarre circular thing happening where the President cites a theory that he was wiretapped
[01:49:28.200 --> 01:49:34.200]  which developed on the fringe right wing media. And then after his tweet storm, info wars
[01:49:34.200 --> 01:49:36.960]  then started saying, well look it was the New York Times who reported it, citing our
[01:49:36.960 --> 01:49:42.240]  story, misreading our story. And now a few weeks later, the White House and the President
[01:49:42.240 --> 01:49:47.800]  are citing info wars. So they've got one kind of bizarre right wing fringe theory to defend
[01:49:47.800 --> 01:49:50.000]  another bizarre right wing fringe theory.
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:55.960]  The crazier it gets, the more they like it. That's their jam.
[01:49:55.960 --> 01:50:02.960]  So there you go. Now, they can say no evidence and make a joke of Trump being spied on.
[01:50:02.960 --> 01:50:04.960]  Of course, why would they do that?
[01:50:04.960 --> 01:50:08.960]  Oh, just like they say the CIA and the FBI are reputable sources.
[01:50:08.960 --> 01:50:12.960]  Oh, now you get it. See the CIA and the FBI run those shows.
[01:50:12.960 --> 01:50:19.960]  The CIA and the FBI are running Jimmy Kimmel, Bill Maher, John Oliver, and Stephen Colbert.
[01:50:19.960 --> 01:50:24.880]  Why else would they sit here and act like they weren't spying on President Trump even
[01:50:24.880 --> 01:50:28.320]  though we have all the evidence that they were?
[01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:32.040]  So let me explain the operation that they're doing right now. They're laying the groundwork
[01:50:32.040 --> 01:50:38.120]  for this to be reported on as a joke. So they do this whole thing before all of it comes
[01:50:38.120 --> 01:50:42.880]  out. Oh, it's a joke. He never spied. And then the average American, the average citizen
[01:50:42.880 --> 01:50:48.520]  is so brainwashed that that then becomes their cemented thought and they don't have the critical
[01:50:48.520 --> 01:50:53.880]  thinking ability to do the research for themselves and realize that Trump was spied on and they
[01:50:53.880 --> 01:50:58.960]  already believe John Oliver, a fake news reporter.
[01:50:58.960 --> 01:51:05.280]  So if you understand that, you understand everything. But to again, draw the analogy
[01:51:05.280 --> 01:51:09.800]  to Bilderberg, which my guest Dan Lyman from Info Wars Europe was reporting in the last
[01:51:09.800 --> 01:51:16.080]  segment who joins me here now. You could do that same exact compilation of all the news.
[01:51:16.080 --> 01:51:21.440]  Everybody's saying Info War says a secret group meets called Bilderberg. Info War says
[01:51:21.440 --> 01:51:27.200]  Bilderberg is meeting in Switzerland. Bilderberg, the group that can control the world, says
[01:51:27.200 --> 01:51:32.720]  Alex Jones. As if it doesn't exist. They wouldn't report on it. Oh, now everybody knows. Now
[01:51:32.720 --> 01:51:38.600]  they're wide up out in the open. And oh, does anybody apologize to Info Wars for reporting
[01:51:38.600 --> 01:51:43.000]  on it first and then being made fun of? So Dan Lyman, again, kind of draw the comparisons
[01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:47.440]  to how they act like something doesn't exist, even though it's right in front of your face.
[01:51:47.440 --> 01:51:52.680]  Yeah, absolutely right. You know, there was recently a hit piece by Buzzfeed on us where
[01:51:52.680 --> 01:51:56.960]  they were talking about that Info Wars has a manager in Switzerland. They just called
[01:51:56.960 --> 01:52:01.320]  us a conspiracy site. No, like not even the least bit of a nod to the fact that we're
[01:52:01.320 --> 01:52:08.160]  a full blown media outlet. So yeah, it's amazing. What's amazing is the event today, you know,
[01:52:08.160 --> 01:52:12.040]  this has been going on for years now. It's out in the open. There's even some mainstream
[01:52:12.040 --> 01:52:17.160]  CNBC and the independent, they're all reporting on it that it's happening. They don't obviously
[01:52:17.160 --> 01:52:21.680]  put the spin on it. That it's just a genial meeting of a bunch of well-meaning power players
[01:52:21.680 --> 01:52:26.440]  who are just trying to figure out how to solve all these world problems. But they're actually
[01:52:26.440 --> 01:52:31.480]  reporting on it now. However, in front of the event, there is just a handful of alternative
[01:52:31.480 --> 01:52:37.440]  media still. There's not even like one self-identified mainstream reporter. I don't see anybody.
[01:52:37.440 --> 01:52:41.440]  I mean, in Davos, I saw Thomson Reuters. You know, they wear the jackets. They're very
[01:52:41.440 --> 01:52:45.920]  proud of where they work for. Here you don't see anything. Even though you have the Wall
[01:52:45.920 --> 01:52:50.120]  Street Journal, you have the Washington Post. They're inside the meeting, these people,
[01:52:50.120 --> 01:52:54.680]  Ann Applebaum and I think Peggy Noonan. They're inside the meeting and they still can't even
[01:52:54.680 --> 01:52:59.680]  get a couple of reporters out there to just cover it. And I was watching some coverage
[01:52:59.680 --> 01:53:03.560]  of it by an independent journalist and he raised the great point saying, if this was
[01:53:03.560 --> 01:53:11.320]  a meeting of actors or celebrities or sports stars, the top 150 in the world essentially,
[01:53:11.320 --> 01:53:15.600]  if they were all in one place, the place would be crawling with press just to catch a glimpse
[01:53:15.600 --> 01:53:21.080]  of them. But they're not even bothering with Bilderberg and it's just, it's crazy.
[01:53:21.080 --> 01:53:26.480]  And doesn't that show you the bread and circus? And then that explains why children grow up
[01:53:26.480 --> 01:53:32.080]  idolizing athletes and not even having a clue about what goes on in the real world. That
[01:53:32.080 --> 01:53:37.560]  shows you it right there. The real, let's say all of these world leaders from the private
[01:53:37.560 --> 01:53:42.440]  industries and from governments and big tech and everything, meet here. These are the people
[01:53:42.440 --> 01:53:47.160]  that actually are shaping the world that you live in. Okay. At least that's what they
[01:53:47.160 --> 01:53:50.080]  claim. And you know, I mean, they say it in their own papers. Look at what they're talking
[01:53:50.080 --> 01:53:54.440]  about in these meetings. But then you have a bunch of athletes that really don't shape
[01:53:54.440 --> 01:53:59.680]  the world outside of their own little sports bubble, which is fine. Don't really impact
[01:53:59.680 --> 01:54:05.240]  the future. Don't really change your life for the good or better, you know, or help your
[01:54:05.240 --> 01:54:09.760]  family or anything really. But that's the obsession. Like you said, I like that analogy.
[01:54:09.760 --> 01:54:17.200]  If you had LeBron James and Tom Brady and Lionel Messi and all of the best athletes
[01:54:17.200 --> 01:54:22.400]  meeting for a conference for whatever, the press would be everywhere. Just look at what
[01:54:22.400 --> 01:54:26.720]  happened to when a Super Bowl is in town. Look at what happens with the Asian player.
[01:54:26.720 --> 01:54:30.520]  I believe he's from Japan who's playing for the Los Angeles Angels. I remember when there
[01:54:30.520 --> 01:54:35.600]  was a player who was playing for the St. Louis Cardinals, so Taguchi, just having a Japanese
[01:54:35.600 --> 01:54:40.880]  athlete in St. Louis, hundreds of Japanese media outlets showed up to every game. So
[01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:46.520]  there's an obsession with sports that doesn't affect the future. But then the actual people
[01:54:46.520 --> 01:54:49.720]  that are claiming to try to shape the future, the media just doesn't even want to pay attention
[01:54:49.720 --> 01:54:50.720]  to that.
[01:54:50.720 --> 01:54:56.320]  Right. If LeBron James has a comment about Trump, you'll see it in every newspaper, every
[01:54:56.320 --> 01:55:01.000]  website, especially if it's derogatory, which of course it always is. But then you have,
[01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:04.840]  you know, these power players, these are some big time folks and they're all getting together
[01:55:04.840 --> 01:55:10.400]  and it's like hardly a whisper. I've managed to talk to a few locals. Obviously the language
[01:55:10.400 --> 01:55:15.000]  barrier is there. I'm not, my Italian is not very strong, but a few of them, they were,
[01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:20.040]  they knew what Bilderberg was, which was a good sign. I don't know how they knew, but
[01:55:20.040 --> 01:55:24.720]  one Italian lady, she said, do you like Bilderberg or don't? I said, no, it's not, I mean, it's
[01:55:24.720 --> 01:55:27.960]  not a good thing. And she said, good, good. And she gave me a handshake. So there's a
[01:55:27.960 --> 01:55:31.320]  little bit of awareness. So that's a good thing, probably more than there was in the
[01:55:31.320 --> 01:55:36.160]  past. But in general, it's just people walking by, going about their everyday life as this
[01:55:36.160 --> 01:55:40.840]  monumental event is happening like right in their, their, their walkway, basically.
[01:55:40.840 --> 01:55:46.680]  Well, and let's, let's kind of shed more light on, on this as well, where when Bilderberg
[01:55:46.680 --> 01:55:50.400]  was more of a secret thing and the media was blacking it out and the only people that
[01:55:50.400 --> 01:55:58.080]  would report on it were info wars. That's when it was truly the, the secret conglomeration
[01:55:58.080 --> 01:56:05.480]  of big industry and big government coming together for a continuity of government scheme.
[01:56:05.480 --> 01:56:10.160]  But once it got forced out there and being reported, that's when they went public. So
[01:56:10.160 --> 01:56:14.920]  the whole, the whole thing about them going public is like a, putting a shadow over the
[01:56:14.920 --> 01:56:20.080]  whole thing. So now they've expanded the thing, they do a whole public rollout of what they're
[01:56:20.080 --> 01:56:25.240]  going to talk about, show you the list. And then, you know, some of these people get inside
[01:56:25.240 --> 01:56:28.160]  and then they kind of see the whole thing and they say, Oh, it's no big deal. They just
[01:56:28.160 --> 01:56:32.800]  have conferences. No, no, no, they have secret meetings. They're acting like this is some
[01:56:32.800 --> 01:56:36.280]  big thing they're showing you. No, no, no, they still have secret meetings with only
[01:56:36.280 --> 01:56:42.000]  a select few. So I just wanted to make sure the audience understands that.
[01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:46.520]  Absolutely. I think I'm trying to figure out why there's so, there isn't a lot. There's
[01:56:46.520 --> 01:56:52.040]  no protesters. I know in past years there's been, you know, plenty of protesters or a
[01:56:52.040 --> 01:56:56.280]  strong alternative media presence here. There's like nothing here this year. And I'm trying
[01:56:56.280 --> 01:57:01.320]  to figure out why that, like trying to figure out from my own perspective, why that is one
[01:57:01.320 --> 01:57:07.080]  angle that I'm thinking is we forced these people out into the open. Now, now enough
[01:57:07.080 --> 01:57:11.640]  people know that they exist. And it's like, we've moved on to the next thing in many ways
[01:57:11.640 --> 01:57:15.720]  because we forced them out into the open. We smoked them out. So I can look at it that
[01:57:15.720 --> 01:57:19.600]  way and say it's a positive thing. Now they can't operate in secrecy because people like
[01:57:19.600 --> 01:57:22.960]  Alex made these people go public. So it could be a good thing.
[01:57:22.960 --> 01:57:27.800]  I think another angle might be though, some of the same people that would go out and protest
[01:57:27.800 --> 01:57:32.920]  that that, you know, that say Trump is trying to help the 1%, now see the Bilderberg group
[01:57:32.920 --> 01:57:36.600]  as anti-Trump. So they're like, oh, maybe I like the Bilderberg group. So there might
[01:57:36.600 --> 01:57:42.800]  be an element of that involved in this too. Dan Lyman, you can find all his work at infowars.Europe.infowars.com.

[01:58:48.320 --> 01:58:53.680]  Western Europe has already banned free speech and an iron curtain of censorship is
[01:58:53.680 --> 01:59:00.720]  sending down over the UK. They're set to pass rules on a law that if you criticize Islam or
[01:59:00.720 --> 01:59:06.320]  gays, you'll get six months in prison. We know we're only about a year or two behind what's
[01:59:06.320 --> 01:59:11.280]  happening in the UK. Stinging in and many others are calling for info wars to be shut down, taken
[01:59:11.280 --> 01:59:17.200]  off the web. Slate magazine has a professor and others saying go beyond censorship, brainwash
[01:59:17.200 --> 01:59:22.880]  young people against info wars. Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually
[01:59:22.880 --> 01:59:28.240]  hear what we have to say. We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists. It is so
[01:59:28.240 --> 01:59:33.520]  critical that you go to infowars.com or slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter
[01:59:33.520 --> 01:59:38.800]  so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block
[01:59:38.800 --> 01:59:44.320]  us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society that is critical to this fight.
[01:59:44.320 --> 01:59:46.800]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[01:59:46.800 --> 02:00:09.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show you found it the tip of the spear it is the Alex
[02:00:09.040 --> 02:00:19.280]  Jones show. All right, there is a badass Uncle Sam. I want to make sure that I don't want to
[02:00:19.280 --> 02:00:22.480]  say his name publicly before I pause if I can say it. We're checking his YouTube channel.
[02:00:23.440 --> 02:00:28.480]  He goes out on the streets of New Orleans and films powerful video. He's dressed up as Uncle Sam.
[02:00:28.480 --> 02:00:35.120]  He talked to citizens. Now check out this amazing confrontation he had with a British professor
[02:00:35.120 --> 02:01:05.120]  who was glad to
[02:01:05.280 --> 02:01:09.680]  court house. That's like someone come along here right now and take me in jail just because I
[02:01:09.680 --> 02:01:14.800]  happen to be yelling in your face calling you a fascist pig which you are. Okay, do you want me
[02:01:14.800 --> 02:01:22.480]  to respond? The reason he was tried for this is because of accumulation of incidents including
[02:01:22.480 --> 02:01:29.840]  extreme violence in football. Again, the power of the state goes against you. They come up with
[02:01:29.840 --> 02:01:34.880]  phony charges. They can come up and dig up everything and everything about you and make you look
[02:01:34.880 --> 02:01:40.000]  like the devil himself. But the fact that he's talking about the destruction of his country.
[02:01:40.880 --> 02:01:46.320]  The fact that you've got idiots right now and the judges saying, oh, we're going to dull all the
[02:01:46.320 --> 02:01:52.880]  knives because the knife stabbing has gone way up. So it does make any difference with the weapon.
[02:01:52.880 --> 02:01:59.200]  It is whether it's a gun or a knife. They said that you have an epidemic of rapes and knife
[02:01:59.200 --> 02:02:05.600]  violence going on in London right now in London surpassed New York for violent crimes. That is
[02:02:05.600 --> 02:02:10.880]  not an epidemic of rape. Would you care to look that up? I'll put money on it. Do you have any
[02:02:10.880 --> 02:02:19.760]  money? I'd like to put money on it. Let's put money on it. Come on, let's put money on it. I'll give you
[02:02:19.760 --> 02:02:29.520]  a 10 to one hodge. I'll give you a 10 bucks. But look it up. Come on, look it up. There's my 10 bucks.
[02:02:29.520 --> 02:02:34.480]  You got the camera. Come on, look it up. I don't have Wi-Fi in this country, so I don't have access
[02:02:34.480 --> 02:02:39.360]  to the resources right now, but I can guarantee there's not been an increase in recent times in
[02:02:39.360 --> 02:02:50.080]  the US. It's actually on the decrease. You only put up your money. Put up your money. Put up your money.
[02:02:50.080 --> 02:02:54.400]  This is just a clip from the video of the Michael Givari YouTube video. What do you do for a living?
[02:02:54.400 --> 02:02:58.800]  Is this what you do when you're alive? How do you damp business when I do for a living?
[02:02:58.800 --> 02:03:03.840]  This is a question. Why don't I do anything for a living? What do you do for a living?
[02:03:03.840 --> 02:03:14.720]  I'm a university professor. What do you teach? What do you teach?
[02:03:16.640 --> 02:03:21.120]  Education studies? Yeah. You're familiar with the Carnegie Institute, of course,
[02:03:21.120 --> 02:03:26.080]  and how they corrupted the entire educational system by going ahead and promoting a socialist
[02:03:26.080 --> 02:03:34.400]  one-world government, right? You know all about that, don't you? Yeah. I am a socialist. I know you are.
[02:03:34.400 --> 02:03:40.400]  That's why I called you a fascist pig, and I meant it. Now you've proved it.
[02:03:42.160 --> 02:03:43.520]  Now you've proved it to me.
[02:03:47.120 --> 02:03:50.400]  So I'm speaking to professionals from England or, you know,
[02:03:50.400 --> 02:03:57.600]  Austria, Germany, wherever, and I'm hearing from them that their countries are being changed
[02:03:57.600 --> 02:04:03.280]  irrepently because of the immigration, the crimes coming up. Women are afraid to walk the streets
[02:04:03.280 --> 02:04:12.400]  now alone, that, you know, their cultures are changing dramatically. So these people are lying to me?
[02:04:13.440 --> 02:04:18.000]  I mean, that's a misperception, perhaps. I don't think it's true that women are
[02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:23.680]  not able to walk around. Okay, so that is just partial clips from the video. The full video is
[02:04:23.680 --> 02:04:28.160]  on the Michael DeBarre channel. Honestly, there's so much classic moments in the full 25-minute
[02:04:28.160 --> 02:04:31.280]  video. We weren't able to get all of them in that, but I suggest you go watch that for yourself.
[02:04:31.280 --> 02:04:36.160]  But let me just say this. As someone that goes into the hordes of the brainwashed masses
[02:04:36.160 --> 02:04:44.560]  and gives them truth, I mean, I can only imagine what it's like to dunk in an NBA finals game,
[02:04:44.560 --> 02:04:49.200]  but I would imagine it's something like that. I would imagine it feels something like that.
[02:04:49.200 --> 02:04:53.200]  So you want to feel what it feels like to dunk in an NBA finals game? Go out on the streets
[02:04:53.200 --> 02:04:58.880]  and talk to the brainwashed liberals. The Senate released 500 pages of documents,
[02:04:58.880 --> 02:05:04.640]  including more text messages between FBI agent Peter Struck and lawyer Lisa Page. And now there's
[02:05:04.640 --> 02:05:10.000]  speculation that those texts suggest the FBI may have been spying on Donald Trump's campaign
[02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:15.600]  earlier than thought. The previously redacted text from December 2015 revealed the approval of
[02:05:15.600 --> 02:05:21.600]  Akonas Luris, which is counterintelligence lingo for spies operating outside of the U.S. Now,
[02:05:21.600 --> 02:05:26.240]  PJ Media reported that Struck was leading the Clinton investigation at the time and would go
[02:05:26.240 --> 02:05:30.560]  on to play a central role in the Trump-Russia probe. It's being assumed that the pair was
[02:05:30.560 --> 02:05:36.400]  referring to the FBI's efforts to bait and hook unsuspecting Trump campaign officials overseas.
[02:05:36.400 --> 02:05:42.640]  President Trump took to Twitter to bash the corrupt FBI lovers, saying Spygate is in full force.
[02:05:42.640 --> 02:05:48.080]  The revelations come as former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe requested immunity
[02:05:48.080 --> 02:05:52.800]  in exchange for testimony regarding what he knows about the Clinton and Russia collusion
[02:05:52.800 --> 02:06:08.960]  investigation. Leigh Ann McAdoo, infowars.com. You found it, the tip of the spear. It is the
[02:06:08.960 --> 02:06:17.360]  Alex Jones show with Owen Troyer. And Brandon Tatum is joining me now at the Officer Tatum
[02:06:17.360 --> 02:06:24.560]  on Twitter. You can find his YouTube channel BTCruiser34. A lot of stuff we could talk about here.
[02:06:24.560 --> 02:06:30.000]  Let's get it started, though, with the Alice Marie Johnson pardon. You know, it's funny,
[02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:34.320]  they say Trump is a racist, but he's pardoned people of all different race colors and creeds,
[02:06:34.320 --> 02:06:39.360]  not just black people, but white people as well, and also Dinesh D'Souza. So all different
[02:06:39.360 --> 02:06:44.080]  kinds of people from all different walks of life, Trump is looking at these cases and he is pardoning
[02:06:44.080 --> 02:06:50.400]  them. I will say there are probably a hundred other Alice Marie Johnson's out there sitting in
[02:06:50.400 --> 02:06:56.960]  jail that don't have Kim Kardashian coming to bat for them. So, you know, there is somewhat of an
[02:06:56.960 --> 02:07:01.680]  injustice here. I do believe, however, overall, you can see why Trump did this and you can see
[02:07:02.240 --> 02:07:07.040]  how the media wants to still say that Trump is X, Y, or Z, even though he is doing this.
[02:07:07.600 --> 02:07:10.240]  But I'm just curious, Brandon, I mean, what do you think? Because
[02:07:10.240 --> 02:07:16.320]  Kim Kardashian gives a shout out to Trump for this pardon. And I don't know if you saw it on
[02:07:16.320 --> 02:07:20.160]  Twitter and looked at the responses, but it's amazing to me because all the Trump haters that
[02:07:20.160 --> 02:07:25.280]  follow Kim Kardashian are justifying it by saying, oh, this is just one time that Trump did good,
[02:07:25.280 --> 02:07:29.360]  and it's really just Kim that did it. It's not really Trump. So, so really just thank Kim,
[02:07:29.360 --> 02:07:33.920]  even though she's here thanking Trump and Marie, Alice Marie Johnson is thanking Trump,
[02:07:33.920 --> 02:07:40.320]  the Trump haters that follow Kim Kardashian still say Trump bad. This is actually just Kim.
[02:07:40.320 --> 02:07:44.320]  Yeah, I think, like I said, man, I think these people are going down a slippery slope and they're
[02:07:44.320 --> 02:07:49.120]  just hoping for the worst with President Trump. But with the pardon of Jack Johnson and the pardon of
[02:07:50.320 --> 02:07:58.320]  Alice Marie Johnson, I think that this is just pivotal. This kind of a pardon is going to change
[02:07:58.320 --> 02:08:04.640]  your family for the rest of her life and the rest of their lives. And it's amazing to me. And I really
[02:08:04.640 --> 02:08:09.520]  do think this is making a huge impact. And this is another thing that the fact that a celebrity
[02:08:09.520 --> 02:08:14.960]  like Kim Kardashian took Donald Trump at his word, went down to the White House and had a
[02:08:14.960 --> 02:08:19.520]  conversation with the man and got him to pardon somebody very important. And I think that this
[02:08:19.520 --> 02:08:24.560]  just shines in the face of all of these ignorant folks that won't even sit at the table with a
[02:08:24.560 --> 02:08:30.240]  president that will literally include you in legislation, include you in the pardon of people
[02:08:30.240 --> 02:08:34.880]  who are very important. And I think that the people who were the haters are losing out and
[02:08:34.880 --> 02:08:39.760]  everybody else with a conscious brain are the ones who are going to benefit from a president
[02:08:39.760 --> 02:08:43.760]  that I think is going to go down in history as one of the best. Well, and think about it too,
[02:08:44.320 --> 02:08:51.360]  where you have a situation with Barack Obama calling Jay-Z specifically requesting, hey,
[02:08:51.360 --> 02:08:56.160]  can you tell some of these other rappers and R&B artists not to meet with the president? So then
[02:08:56.160 --> 02:09:02.160]  Jay-Z does it. I don't know why he's Obama's callboy, but does it? Contacts a Meek Mill, for example,
[02:09:02.160 --> 02:09:07.280]  and says, hey, don't go meet with President Trump. It's bad for your ratings. It'll be bad for your
[02:09:07.280 --> 02:09:11.840]  public image. And then you say, well, wait a second, Kanye West has said Trump is his brother.
[02:09:11.840 --> 02:09:17.040]  Kanye West meets with Trump. Kanye West is pro Trump, really. And he just had the number one
[02:09:17.040 --> 02:09:22.240]  album in the world in 83 different countries, top seven songs on iTunes. But it's like, they still
[02:09:22.240 --> 02:09:26.400]  don't get it. I mean, I'm just, it's like, you still like, why wouldn't you meet with President
[02:09:26.400 --> 02:09:29.760]  Trump? And that's like what you're saying. It's like, duh, you would meet with President Trump.
[02:09:31.280 --> 02:09:36.240]  It's Tom Krabs in the bucket, man. You know, I think Jay-Z is one of the leaders of the
[02:09:36.240 --> 02:09:42.320]  Krab in the bucket mentality. LeBron James falls in that category, unfortunately. And these individuals,
[02:09:42.320 --> 02:09:45.760]  they have an opportunity to change history. They have an opportunity to be on the right
[02:09:45.760 --> 02:09:50.400]  side of history. And people like Kanye West, opening up his mind to be a free thinker.
[02:09:50.960 --> 02:09:56.480]  And he's leaving these people in the dust, number one album in the world. That is absolutely
[02:09:56.480 --> 02:10:01.120]  amazing. When you had all these African-American people that are supposedly boycotting him,
[02:10:01.120 --> 02:10:05.280]  and all these rappers are talking bad about him, how he's a sellout, and that he would never be
[02:10:05.280 --> 02:10:10.240]  the same. And he's outselling them and all of his records. And that's not even including his Yeezy line,
[02:10:10.800 --> 02:10:14.560]  where it's probably going to be one of the top earners in the world as well. So
[02:10:14.560 --> 02:10:19.120]  I just really, I just really think these people are playing crabs in the bucket and it's not
[02:10:19.120 --> 02:10:23.440]  going to work. When a young brother tried to take a step out of the box, open his mind and
[02:10:23.440 --> 02:10:28.720]  understand it and not be the status quo, you know, he gets pulled down by other people. And I find
[02:10:28.720 --> 02:10:34.320]  that very disappointing. But I'm also encouraged by a lot of the young African-American people who
[02:10:34.320 --> 02:10:39.200]  are coming out of the box and who are going to flourish because of it. Well, and let's go back
[02:10:39.200 --> 02:10:45.760]  to this whole White House visit boycott of the Eagles. They can say, oh, Trump canceled it. No,
[02:10:45.760 --> 02:10:49.600]  no, no. They lied to him. They said they were sending 70 people. Then they only were going to
[02:10:49.600 --> 02:10:54.400]  send one player. They set him up. He said, I'm sorry, not going to be work my time. And then,
[02:10:54.400 --> 02:10:59.040]  of course, what does the media do? They spend it, oh, Trump bad. Oh, look at Trump. And so then
[02:10:59.040 --> 02:11:04.160]  they have to bring it to an NBA Finals press conference and have LeBron comment on it. And
[02:11:04.160 --> 02:11:08.720]  what does LeBron say? Oh, I'm not surprised. You know, I won't be visiting the White House. Of
[02:11:08.720 --> 02:11:12.640]  course, he's not going to win. But the Warriors won't be visiting the White House either. And so
[02:11:12.640 --> 02:11:17.280]  he makes that statement. So I try to take a step back and understand this because I like sports.
[02:11:17.280 --> 02:11:22.320]  I mean, I came up in the sports media. I like watching the NFL. I like watching LeBron James
[02:11:22.320 --> 02:11:26.000]  play basketball. I think it's an amazing spectacle. But then he says stuff like this and you just
[02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:30.000]  scratch your head and you're like, dude, are you really that dumb? Or are you intentionally trying
[02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.560]  to bring this country down? What are you talking about? So let's try to figure it out. Okay.
[02:11:33.280 --> 02:11:37.440]  How does this all start? Colin Kaepernick takes a knee during the national anthem.
[02:11:37.440 --> 02:11:44.080]  While Obama is president, nobody stops going to the White House. Nobody cares. Then Trump gets in
[02:11:44.640 --> 02:11:49.280]  and the NFL ratings are collapsing and Trump simply says, look, maybe we should stop kneeling for the
[02:11:49.280 --> 02:11:54.560]  national anthem and be more patriotic. You might see the ratings return. He's 100% right.
[02:11:54.560 --> 02:11:58.720]  But then it becomes this national issue and it's somehow Trump's fault. Well, why were you taking
[02:11:58.720 --> 02:12:03.840]  the knee in the first place? Trump wasn't even president. So then all of a sudden the knee becomes
[02:12:03.840 --> 02:12:10.000]  a protest of Trump, even though it started as a protest against injustice in the country,
[02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:14.880]  which if anyone's done anything for injustice against black people, it is Trump. I mean,
[02:12:14.880 --> 02:12:21.360]  the whole weave that they're webbing here is like, it's so insane. Again, what do you think?
[02:12:21.360 --> 02:12:25.840]  Is LeBron James just that ignorant of the situation? I mean, he spends all his day dribbling a ball.
[02:12:25.840 --> 02:12:33.600]  I could understand it. Or does he consciously want people not to like Trump for whatever reason?
[02:12:33.600 --> 02:12:37.600]  Oh, and you hit the nail on the head, man. This is the epidemic. Like, I think people
[02:12:37.600 --> 02:12:43.920]  don't understand how deep the ties on the roots are in the black community that if you for one minute
[02:12:43.920 --> 02:12:47.840]  think that you're going to do anything out of the box, man, you are going to be shunned.
[02:12:47.840 --> 02:12:52.960]  And I think LeBron James, and I said this on another thing, that he's not a leader.
[02:12:52.960 --> 02:12:57.200]  He's just a successful basketball player, which puts him in a position
[02:12:57.200 --> 02:13:00.480]  that people consider him to be a leader. He don't have the leadership skills.
[02:13:00.480 --> 02:13:05.600]  LeBron James isn't that dumb. I don't believe so. But what he's doing is he's a follower. So he's
[02:13:05.600 --> 02:13:11.760]  following the status quo and this anti-Trump rhetoric. And he's just looking dumber and
[02:13:11.760 --> 02:13:17.040]  dumber. And I think that the president is what you consider a standup man. If I was the president,
[02:13:17.040 --> 02:13:22.080]  I'd do the same thing. It is a privilege and an honor to be invited to the White House.
[02:13:22.080 --> 02:13:26.240]  And if y'all can't get y'all stuff together, and you're going to send half of the team,
[02:13:26.240 --> 02:13:30.000]  a quarter of the team, or whatever the case may be, then you don't need to be here.
[02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:34.000]  Y'all need to come together as a team. You can show up on the football field and suit up and
[02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:38.800]  play as a team. And you need to come to the White House as a team. I'm glad to see the president,
[02:13:38.800 --> 02:13:44.400]  you know, show some, you know what, and stand up to these people. Because it's not about celebrity
[02:13:44.400 --> 02:13:50.000]  status. It's not about kissing and bathing these people. It's about, it's about having integrity
[02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:54.160]  and support in this country. And if you don't, you don't get invited to the White House. That's
[02:13:54.160 --> 02:13:59.360]  just the way it is. Well, and think about this too. You don't think that over the decades of this
[02:13:59.360 --> 02:14:04.160]  tradition of champions visiting the White House, you haven't had individuals that probably didn't
[02:14:04.160 --> 02:14:09.600]  like the president, disagreed on his policies, who knows what else. Yet they didn't make a big fuss
[02:14:09.600 --> 02:14:14.480]  about it. They probably still showed up or just quietly said, I'm not going to partake in this
[02:14:14.480 --> 02:14:18.320]  celebration, which is perfectly fine. You don't need to make a national case of it. But what's
[02:14:18.320 --> 02:14:24.000]  the difference? And this is where the false consensus operation comes into play. They have
[02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:29.200]  this false consensus that Trump is a racist. Trump is a bigot. So now all of a sudden, it's like,
[02:14:29.200 --> 02:14:35.360]  oh, it's okay for me to skip this. I'm protesting racism. No, you're not. You're buying into a
[02:14:35.360 --> 02:14:40.800]  false consensus. You're buying into the brainwashing. And I agree with you. If I were Trump, I'd take
[02:14:40.800 --> 02:14:45.440]  it personally. None of them boycotted Obama. None of them boycotted Bush. They're clearly boycotting
[02:14:45.440 --> 02:14:48.960]  me. I would do the same thing. I would take it personally and I would say, you know what, if you
[02:14:48.960 --> 02:14:53.520]  don't want to come here and be a part of history, then screw you. I've got other people that I would
[02:14:53.520 --> 02:14:59.120]  rather spend my time with. I agree 100%. I hope that he invites some patriotic people to the White
[02:14:59.120 --> 02:15:04.720]  House and in their place and to have a great celebration. I hope he invites you and I both.
[02:15:04.720 --> 02:15:09.280]  So, you know, I'm not disappointed that he did it. And I think he did the right thing.
[02:15:09.840 --> 02:15:13.360]  And I like to see him continue to do things like just moving forward.
[02:15:13.360 --> 02:15:17.680]  And, you know, the NFL is going to continue to suffer because I know a lot of people on my
[02:15:17.680 --> 02:15:23.280]  newsbeat that said despite the rule change, they're still not going to watch the NFL. And I'll tell
[02:15:23.280 --> 02:15:26.880]  you what, I'm not going to watch it either. It's going to be another year. Watch it. Do not watch
[02:15:26.880 --> 02:15:32.640]  the NFL. Do not participate in this unanimous. Well, here's what's going to happen. It's actually
[02:15:32.640 --> 02:15:36.960]  going to become a bigger issue. The NFL Jets owner has already said he'll pay the fines of anyone
[02:15:36.960 --> 02:15:42.480]  that kneels and now players are going to look at it as an even bigger protest because the league
[02:15:42.480 --> 02:15:47.280]  is telling them not to do it. So I think the knees are not going away or they'll find some new way
[02:15:47.280 --> 02:15:52.400]  to protest and they'll keep destroying the NFL product. I mean, why would you kill the Golden
[02:15:52.400 --> 02:16:00.880]  Goose? That's what they're doing. Bacon lovers, we ship free. Try our amazing bacon. No refrigeration

[02:20:22.960 --> 02:20:32.640]  host, Owen Shroyer. This Sunday, this Sunday, Sunday, Sunday, we are having a hashtag MeToo
[02:20:32.640 --> 02:20:38.160]  protest here in Austin, Texas, outside Bass Concert Hall near the University of Texas,
[02:20:38.720 --> 02:20:46.720]  where Bill Clinton will be going for his book tour. That's right, the guy that was broke coming
[02:20:46.720 --> 02:20:51.840]  out of the White House, the guy that was philandering with all different kinds of women,
[02:20:51.840 --> 02:20:56.560]  cheating on Hillary Clinton, then she threatened and abused them, bullied them.
[02:20:59.680 --> 02:21:05.600]  And the left gets to have their hashtag MeToo protests in the name of Donald Trump,
[02:21:05.600 --> 02:21:09.120]  even though there's been nothing there, they ignored Harvey Weinstein,
[02:21:10.560 --> 02:21:15.200]  and Bill Clinton. So we're going to have our MeToo protests at Bill Clinton this Sunday,
[02:21:15.200 --> 02:21:21.920]  6 p.m. Central Time outside Bass Concert Hall, where President, former President Bill Clinton
[02:21:21.920 --> 02:21:27.760]  is touring for his newest book. You know, it's amazing. Think about Bill Clinton right now.
[02:21:29.200 --> 02:21:31.920]  I don't know. I mean, they must be desperate for money somehow.
[02:21:32.720 --> 02:21:37.200]  Why else would Bill Clinton, unless, why else would Bill Clinton go on this tour,
[02:21:37.200 --> 02:21:41.600]  this book tour, where everywhere he goes now, he gets confronted with his,
[02:21:41.600 --> 02:21:50.640]  with his rape allegations, with his past. So why does, why is he even doing it? It's crazy.
[02:21:53.040 --> 02:21:58.400]  So he'll be in Austin, Texas, 6 p.m. Central this Sunday evening. We'll be having a hashtag MeToo
[02:21:58.400 --> 02:22:04.720]  protest. I hope you can make it up. All info warriors from Dallas, from Houston, from San
[02:22:04.720 --> 02:22:11.920]  Antonio, from Austin, Texas. I hope you can join me this Sunday evening at 6 p.m. Central

[02:22:51.840 --> 02:22:55.920]  People are wearing them out. I understand, you know, obviously you wear a conservative shirt
[02:22:55.920 --> 02:23:00.560]  out, a Trump shirt out, a radical liberal is likely to punch you in the face or try to,
[02:23:00.560 --> 02:23:04.720]  you know, rip your head off you or something. But some brave people still go out there and do it
[02:23:04.720 --> 02:23:08.880]  every day and face the hate. And they've been saying actually they've been getting a more
[02:23:08.880 --> 02:23:15.440]  positive response now. So t-shirts, hats also available at infowarstore.com. We're trying to
[02:23:15.440 --> 02:23:21.440]  get back in touch with Brandon Tatum. Guys, I'm guessing we still don't have that connection made.
[02:23:21.440 --> 02:23:26.960]  Okay, then in the meantime, let's roll then clip six, because this is why we're, this is what we're
[02:23:26.960 --> 02:23:33.520]  doing. We cannot allow these traders to America to come to our town and not protest them. So guys,
[02:23:33.520 --> 02:23:38.880]  roll this clip through, including the ending. This is Bill Clinton at his book tour, getting
[02:23:38.880 --> 02:23:42.880]  confronted by a patriot in a crowded theater. Go ahead and roll the clip.
[02:23:42.880 --> 02:23:52.160]  Why didn't you fly on Jeffrey Epstein's Lolita Express 26 times? 26 times, Bill.
[02:23:52.720 --> 02:24:01.680]  What were you doing on Jeffrey Epstein's plane? He knows James Patterson knows who Jeffrey Epstein is.
[02:24:01.680 --> 02:24:11.600]  Child sex trafficker, you flew on him 26 times. What do you got nothing to say?
[02:24:12.800 --> 02:24:19.680]  He knows who it is. James, tell him who it is. This isn't him. He's not, it's not no concession.
[02:24:19.680 --> 02:24:28.240]  Not for questions. Okay. You wrote a book on Jeff, 26 times, Bill.
[02:24:33.440 --> 02:24:36.800]  You didn't investigate it. Let's go. You didn't investigate it.
[02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:42.000]  Look it up. Jeffrey Epstein. Who cares? Yeah.
[02:24:43.840 --> 02:24:49.280]  Yeah. We know, Bill. So there you go. And we'll roll that clip again. But again,
[02:24:49.280 --> 02:24:52.160]  this is what you have to do when these people come to your town, folks. So that's why we're
[02:24:52.160 --> 02:24:57.680]  protesting Bill Clinton this Sunday. Now, Brandon, you said something in the last segment that I
[02:24:57.680 --> 02:25:02.000]  kind of want to, want to get to here. You talk about LeBron James being a bad leader. Now,
[02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:07.840]  I want to hear you expand on that a little bit, but I would say, you know, just from a sports
[02:25:07.840 --> 02:25:12.640]  perspective, a lot of people could understand this because you look at LeBron James, when he
[02:25:12.640 --> 02:25:16.960]  doesn't win the title in Cleveland, he flies down to Miami to join the big three down there to win
[02:25:16.960 --> 02:25:21.120]  his titles. He comes back to Cleveland when they have Kyrie Irving wins the title with him and other
[02:25:21.120 --> 02:25:26.160]  superstar. Now Kyrie is gone. Looks like the calves are about to lose and it looks like James
[02:25:26.160 --> 02:25:30.960]  is going to leave again. So you can kind of take that analogy and say, and I'm not saying he's a
[02:25:30.960 --> 02:25:33.760]  bad leader on the quarter, a bad basketball player. Obviously he's probably one of the best in the
[02:25:33.760 --> 02:25:38.640]  world, but there's a difference between, in my mind, a great leader like Michael Jordan, who
[02:25:38.640 --> 02:25:43.280]  stays in one place and just puts his head down and wins as opposed to LeBron, who looks for the
[02:25:43.280 --> 02:25:48.640]  best environment for him to be in to win. But talk about your comments saying that he's a bad leader
[02:25:48.640 --> 02:25:53.280]  when it comes to the messages he's sending out there, not just to the black community, but to
[02:25:53.280 --> 02:26:01.520]  the youth in general as well. Right. So when you study leadership, there's a difference between a
[02:26:01.520 --> 02:26:06.320]  person who has the attributes of being a leader and a person who just assumes a position as a
[02:26:06.320 --> 02:26:11.280]  leader. So for instance, just because a person is promoted to be a supervisor doesn't make them
[02:26:11.280 --> 02:26:16.480]  automatically a good leader. They just have a positional leadership. And so LeBron James,
[02:26:16.480 --> 02:26:21.600]  his greatness as a basketball player, puts him in positional leadership. That doesn't mean he
[02:26:21.600 --> 02:26:27.680]  have leadership qualities. And I think leadership qualities will lead a person to make proper
[02:26:27.680 --> 02:26:32.160]  decisions like stand up above everybody else and say, Hey, let's go meet with the president,
[02:26:32.160 --> 02:26:36.960]  because logically we can get things done if we meet with the man that can get stuff done.
[02:26:36.960 --> 02:26:43.600]  And, you know, so we have to, like our people are blending the two, you know, sports leadership
[02:26:43.600 --> 02:26:48.320]  is different than being a leader in a role model to everybody else. And I think that LeBron James
[02:26:48.320 --> 02:26:53.600]  is not what I consider to be a role model in any other aspect other than him shooting a basketball.
[02:26:53.600 --> 02:26:59.840]  That's my own personal opinion. I'm just confused why he would campaign for Hillary Clinton and
[02:26:59.840 --> 02:27:05.840]  tow the water for the Democrat Party that has done nothing in the inner cities, nothing for all
[02:27:05.840 --> 02:27:09.600]  the virtue signaling they do for black people. What have they actually done here? Trump gets an
[02:27:09.600 --> 02:27:14.160]  office and black unemployment. It's an all time low. So even if you want to take that angle that
[02:27:14.160 --> 02:27:18.560]  the media always loves to use as though, oh, you know, Democrats are really looking out for the
[02:27:18.560 --> 02:27:24.400]  minorities and Trump is a racist and hates them. Well, the actual facts and data don't show that at all.
[02:27:26.400 --> 02:27:32.560]  Right. And that's like I said, a person who was a leader is going to have documented data on their
[02:27:32.560 --> 02:27:37.920]  approach to being quasi and activists. People who are not leaders don't look up specs. They
[02:27:37.920 --> 02:27:43.280]  look up trends and popularity. Wherever the tide go, that's where LeBron goes. And the popular
[02:27:43.280 --> 02:27:48.400]  thing is Hillary Clinton. And they probably pay him a lot of money for him to support her. And
[02:27:48.400 --> 02:27:53.280]  that's where his mindset goes. He's not going to what's right. He's going to what's popular and
[02:27:53.280 --> 02:27:58.320]  what's trendy. And so, I mean, I don't expect a man to be a leader soon because he's young.
[02:27:58.320 --> 02:28:02.960]  He's been in the spotlight since he's been like 16 years old. He'd never had to be, like I said,
[02:28:02.960 --> 02:28:07.840]  he never had to gather those leadership skills. He's just been forced in a position to do so.
[02:28:07.840 --> 02:28:12.160]  And another thing I want to say before we end the show is that all these NFL players, I saw the
[02:28:12.160 --> 02:28:16.880]  Eagles posting stuff in the locker room on these cards and stuff. It is about time that people
[02:28:16.880 --> 02:28:21.680]  stop running their mouth about these things and actually get out and do something. These NFL players
[02:28:21.680 --> 02:28:26.160]  have millions and millions of dollars. They can go right now to the local law enforcement agency
[02:28:26.160 --> 02:28:30.960]  and assist in training. They can do all of these things, but yet still they sit in the locker
[02:28:30.960 --> 02:28:35.360]  room taking a knee and holding up pulses. It's getting old, man, and it's not working.
[02:28:38.080 --> 02:28:43.680]  And you're not really seeing the results of these protests or of whatever you want to call it in
[02:28:43.680 --> 02:28:48.160]  the actual communities. And isn't that what they want? Don't they want results? I would do something
[02:28:48.160 --> 02:28:52.000]  differently instead of the same thing over and over again. That's considered insane. Brandon Tatum,
[02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:56.320]  thank you for joining us at The Officer Tatum on Twitter. BT Cruiser 34 on The Crapper.

[02:30:11.920 --> 02:30:16.640]  screen and it had to load down the page on my dial-up internet and I thought it was pretty cool

[02:33:20.480 --> 02:33:25.760]  The Alex Jones Show and now your host, Owen Shroyer.
[02:33:51.200 --> 02:33:57.120]  But it's working. They are finding lawbreakers and President Trump is fulfilling his promise.
[02:33:58.080 --> 02:34:05.120]  In fact, you had 50,000 people, 50,000 people. I can't remember if it was this month or this year.
[02:34:06.480 --> 02:34:13.040]  50,000 people trying to cross the border illegally apprehended. 50,000 people. I mean,
[02:34:13.040 --> 02:34:18.880]  just think about that. So anyway, that's just President Trump fulfilling his promise. But
[02:34:18.880 --> 02:34:26.320]  look at this madness from Eric Swalwell. Eric Swalwell. I'm telling you, I don't understand
[02:34:26.320 --> 02:34:32.640]  how a guy like this exists. Either this is the most blackmailed person in the history of the world
[02:34:32.640 --> 02:34:39.520]  or literally the guy's brain is the size of a peanut. And a peanut may even be smarter.
[02:34:40.240 --> 02:34:44.720]  Look at what Eric Swalwell tweets out today. I mean, the guy, everything the guy tweets out
[02:34:44.720 --> 02:34:49.280]  is so laughable, you could you could just have a comedy skit. But he tweets this out.
[02:34:50.160 --> 02:34:55.200]  If you're in a campaign for federal office and a foreign agent offers you dirt on your opponent,
[02:34:55.920 --> 02:35:04.400]  you should tell the FBI. Now, do you realize the irony of this, folks? Do you realize the double
[02:35:04.400 --> 02:35:12.960]  standard of this? Ladies and gentlemen, Hillary Clinton paid for foreign agents to get dirt on
[02:35:12.960 --> 02:35:22.080]  Donald Trump. It's so outrageous. This whole thing has reached such levels of deception
[02:35:23.360 --> 02:35:31.200]  and tomfoolery. You can't even find it on a map. There is nothing historically to make reference
[02:35:31.200 --> 02:35:39.680]  to this where they say Trump is trying to collude with Russia for allegedly trying to get dirt on
[02:35:39.680 --> 02:35:47.600]  Hillary Clinton via WikiLeaks or Putin or whoever. But wait a second. Oh, and so by the way,
[02:35:47.600 --> 02:35:53.520]  so they decided to spy on President Trump. But wait a second. It was Hillary Clinton who paid
[02:35:54.400 --> 02:36:01.520]  Fusion GPS to get dirt from foreign operatives Christopher Steele working with five different
[02:36:01.520 --> 02:36:09.600]  Russians to draw up a dossier on President Trump as opposition research. So here, Eric Swalwell says,
[02:36:10.560 --> 02:36:14.720]  if you're in a campaign for federal office and a foreign agent offers you dirt on your opponent,
[02:36:14.720 --> 02:36:21.360]  you should tell the FBI. So then according to Eric Swalwell, Hillary Clinton should have called
[02:36:21.360 --> 02:36:28.240]  the FBI and reported herself for paying Fusion GPS to get opposition research from a foreign
[02:36:28.240 --> 02:36:33.200]  intelligence agent, Christopher Steele. Do you understand how ludicrous this is? Do you understand
[02:36:33.200 --> 02:36:38.080]  why this drives me crazy? Do you understand why I go insane having to report this stuff?
[02:36:39.600 --> 02:36:43.600]  I just don't understand why the average American doesn't have logic and critical thinking anymore.
[02:36:48.320 --> 02:36:53.280]  Now, I was going to go to a clip of Eric Swalwell on Tucker Carlson last night because it's just
[02:36:53.280 --> 02:37:00.320]  the same ridiculous crap and you're just like, oh my God, how dumb is this guy? Oh, good Lord,
[02:37:00.320 --> 02:37:07.280]  tell me this man is not actually in our government. It actually is. He's on intelligence communities.
[02:37:08.160 --> 02:37:12.080]  Eric Swalwell is on intelligence committees, a guy who has no intelligence.
[02:37:12.080 --> 02:37:23.200]  Who says, again, I mean, folks, this is so loaded. This is so outrageous. This is so ironic.
[02:37:25.120 --> 02:37:34.160]  It's like, I don't even know how to report on it. Hi, grass is green. Wow. Thank you, Shroyer.
[02:37:34.800 --> 02:37:40.960]  That's like this. Again, let me just say this one more time. This is insane. Eric Swalwell says,
[02:37:40.960 --> 02:37:45.520]  if you're in a campaign for federal office and a foreign agent offers you dirt on your
[02:37:45.520 --> 02:37:50.400]  opponent, you should tell the FBI. So according to Eric Swalwell, Hillary Clinton should have
[02:37:50.400 --> 02:37:57.360]  called the FBI and reported herself and her own campaign for funding fusion GPS opposition
[02:37:57.360 --> 02:38:02.480]  research from Christopher Steele, a British intelligent agent for a fake dossier report
[02:38:02.480 --> 02:38:11.680]  on Donald Trump, where he colluded with five Russian assets to draw it up. You know,
[02:38:13.760 --> 02:38:20.480]  maybe my frustration is overblown because I don't take into account because I don't have it in front
[02:38:20.480 --> 02:38:26.720]  of me every day. But the American public in general doesn't buy this anymore. But then you see Eric
[02:38:26.720 --> 02:38:34.800]  Swalwell getting voted back in at a 70% clip in the primaries. A guy on the intelligence committee
[02:38:34.800 --> 02:38:44.000]  who has no intelligence. He's so dumb. Again, is Eric Swalwell this dumb or this compromised?
[02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:51.760]  Is he this stupid or is he that blackmailed? You take your pick, folks. There's no in between
[02:38:51.760 --> 02:39:00.080]  ground here. Eric Swalwell is either that stupid or that blackmailed. If you ask me, I'd say both
[02:39:00.720 --> 02:39:05.040]  because to get the kind of blackmail you have on Eric Swalwell, you probably have to be pretty
[02:39:05.040 --> 02:39:11.600]  stupid to begin with. So I would say both things are true. But it's just incredible
[02:39:11.600 --> 02:39:22.160]  that these people are in our government. And this is why the average American now
[02:39:24.560 --> 02:39:30.240]  is understanding how the government's become so corrupt. But more than that, even inept.
[02:39:31.440 --> 02:39:36.320]  Just totally inept. We're even Howard Schultz now, a famed liberal Democrat
[02:39:36.320 --> 02:39:43.920]  who their rumoring may enter the presidential race of 2020, looks at some of these Democrat policies
[02:39:44.480 --> 02:39:50.240]  and he says, wait a second, how do we afford all this? He's like, we can't afford to be paying
[02:39:50.240 --> 02:39:54.320]  people. We can't afford to be giving people money. We can't afford to be funding Planned
[02:39:54.320 --> 02:39:59.200]  Parenthood. We can't afford to be funding all of this crap that we're funding. Funding now
[02:39:59.760 --> 02:40:06.000]  free tuition, you say you want. And so here's a businessman who understands the bottom line.
[02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:10.560]  I mean, you have to at least call a spade a spade. Think about running for the Democrat Party,
[02:40:10.560 --> 02:40:13.840]  perhaps looking at some of their policies. And he's just like, well, hold on a second.
[02:40:14.400 --> 02:40:19.760]  This doesn't work. You don't have the money. Do you know how to balance a budget? Clearly not.
[02:40:21.840 --> 02:40:26.000]  And then Trump is that person except from the other side with the business experience and the
[02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:34.160]  know how, but also well beyond that, as far as his patriotism and what he's trying to do right now.
[02:40:34.160 --> 02:40:39.680]  I mean, you realize that there's Trump towers all over the world.
[02:40:43.600 --> 02:40:50.160]  Those didn't just pop up magically. He had to make business deals. He had to negotiate.
[02:40:50.160 --> 02:40:54.800]  He had to meet people. He had to establish friendships all over the world. And so people
[02:40:54.800 --> 02:41:01.760]  know Trump's not a Russian agent. People know that this is total BS all around the world.
[02:41:01.760 --> 02:41:07.120]  People know that the television news is lying to them. BBC News in England is a joke.
[02:41:07.760 --> 02:41:10.720]  It's almost worse than CNN, if you can believe that.
[02:41:15.600 --> 02:41:21.520]  But here's Eric Swalwell. And he's not alone in this. He just puts his idiocracy out there every
[02:41:21.520 --> 02:41:27.680]  day. If you're in a campaign for federal office and a foreign agent offers you dirt on your opponent,
[02:41:27.680 --> 02:41:32.640]  you should tell the FBI. So again, according to Eric Swalwell, Hillary Clinton should have called
[02:41:32.640 --> 02:41:40.400]  the FBI on herself for funding opposition research using Christopher Steele and five unnamed Russian
[02:41:40.400 --> 02:41:50.240]  agents to compile a made up dossier as opposition research. It's really incredible. It's truly incredible.
[02:41:50.240 --> 02:42:00.640]  I don't know. I don't know what you do if these people continue to get voted into government.
[02:42:00.640 --> 02:42:05.680]  Like, how does Omar Navarro, who's running against Maxine Waters,
[02:42:07.840 --> 02:42:10.800]  who has actually ran a campaign in his district,
[02:42:12.400 --> 02:42:19.200]  get 10,000 votes? Maxine Waters gets 40,000 votes? Has barely campaigned in her district at all?
[02:42:19.200 --> 02:42:25.680]  Last campaign event she did had 10 people, half of which aren't even voting age.
[02:42:26.800 --> 02:42:32.320]  Maxine Waters gets 10 people at a campaign event. Omar Navarro gets hundreds of people. Every time
[02:42:32.320 --> 02:42:36.800]  he does a public speaking event on Twitter or social media, gets somehow Maxine Waters gets
[02:42:36.800 --> 02:42:42.240]  40,000 votes? How is that possible? How does a woman that gets 10 people to show up at an event
[02:42:42.240 --> 02:42:50.960]  get 40,000 votes? And if you don't question that, then you're an idiot. And if you're Eric Swalwell,
[02:42:50.960 --> 02:43:12.720]  you're even dumber than an idiot.
[02:43:21.760 --> 02:43:27.120]  They began studying this effect in public trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this
[02:43:27.120 --> 02:43:32.800]  research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[02:43:32.800 --> 02:43:37.600]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine. In fact,
[02:43:37.600 --> 02:43:42.160]  current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase,
[02:43:42.160 --> 02:43:47.200]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.

[02:45:00.240 --> 02:45:07.120]  of censorship is ascending down over the UK. They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you
[02:45:07.120 --> 02:45:13.440]  criticize Islam or gage, you'll get six months in prison. We know we're only about a year or two
[02:45:13.440 --> 02:45:17.760]  behind what's happening in the UK. Stinging in and many others are calling for InfoWars to be
[02:45:17.760 --> 02:45:24.160]  shut down, taken off the web. Slate magazine has a professor and others saying go beyond censorship,
[02:45:24.160 --> 02:45:29.840]  brainwash young people against InfoWars. Psychologically inoculate them with lies
[02:45:29.840 --> 02:45:34.400]  so they don't actually hear what we have to say. We are the most hated news source in the world,
[02:45:34.400 --> 02:45:40.240]  my globalist. It is so critical that you go to infowars.com or slash newsletter and sign up
[02:45:40.240 --> 02:45:45.120]  for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way
[02:45:45.120 --> 02:45:51.440]  in and block us being able to engage in free, open dialogue as a society. That is critical to
[02:45:51.440 --> 02:45:57.680]  this fight. We will prevail if you take action and I know you will. I want to plow into all of this,
[02:45:58.560 --> 02:46:03.520]  but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that
[02:46:03.520 --> 02:46:11.440]  when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books or videos or other material from
[02:46:11.440 --> 02:46:19.360]  infowars.com, you are funding the revolution. I cannot say it any clear and so it is essential
[02:46:19.360 --> 02:46:23.360]  that you purchase the products at infowars.com. I don't want to thank everybody that has, but

[02:46:44.800 --> 02:46:49.040]  stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies and that's
[02:46:49.040 --> 02:46:53.280]  who they are and they know we know who they are and they're coming back against us so we need your support.
[02:46:53.280 --> 02:47:01.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:47:14.320 --> 02:47:22.560]  Broadcasting live from the UN stronghold, Austin, Texas. You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[02:47:22.560 --> 02:47:31.200]  and now your host Owen Troyer. There really is a problem in this country with mental illness
[02:47:32.480 --> 02:47:38.720]  and I'm not sure what you stack up a story like this to as far as what degree of mental illness
[02:47:38.720 --> 02:47:46.080]  or how you get to this point. Man admits to intentionally getting HIV so that he could
[02:47:46.080 --> 02:47:53.440]  intentionally spread it to others. This is a 25-year-old in Arkansas doing this, also all
[02:47:53.440 --> 02:48:01.840]  kinds of other crazy stuff that he was doing, selling drugs, doing meth, etc. But once again,
[02:48:01.840 --> 02:48:11.440]  you have a situation, this individual had child porn in his possession which was also
[02:48:11.440 --> 02:48:20.960]  chalked up on the charges. Now, actually, this isn't even the right clip. Clip 13 is one clip.
[02:48:20.960 --> 02:48:27.200]  Guys, where is the clip that I put in the folder today? Here, find the clip that I put in the
[02:48:27.200 --> 02:48:34.000]  folder today of the Polk County Sheriff from Florida talking about the truth when it comes to child
[02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:39.840]  porn. But before we do that, you just had the man arrested in Arkansas that had child porn.
[02:48:39.840 --> 02:48:46.880]  You've got the Pito Gate porn arrest going down almost daily. You had the child sex dungeon,
[02:48:46.880 --> 02:48:54.400]  human trafficking dungeon, found in Tucson, Arizona with a quote-unquote rape tree inside it
[02:48:54.400 --> 02:48:58.320]  where you harness the children to the tree. I'm just going to leave it that, folks. I mean,
[02:48:58.320 --> 02:49:04.880]  you can imagine. But here's clip 13. Another massive child sex trafficking bust was made in
[02:49:04.880 --> 02:49:11.760]  Atlanta. Children are reunited with their families after a month-long sting of accused
[02:49:11.760 --> 02:49:16.400]  sex traffickers in the metro area. News since 5. Channel 2's Mike Pachennick is live in Alpharetta.
[02:49:16.400 --> 02:49:22.560]  He tells us what officers uncovered at one local hotel there. Mike. Yeah, Joe Vita,
[02:49:22.560 --> 02:49:28.960]  Alpharetta Police were among about 40 police departments working on this Operation Safe Summer
[02:49:28.960 --> 02:49:35.680]  Cracking Down on Unsafe Child Sex Trafficking. On one afternoon nearly two weeks ago undercover
[02:49:35.680 --> 02:49:41.280]  Alpharetta detectives responded to an ad for sex in a room at this Westside Parkway Hotel
[02:49:41.280 --> 02:49:46.640]  then arrested a woman and her boyfriend Mario Banks, who police say was acting as her pimp.
[02:49:46.640 --> 02:49:50.560]  A lot of people don't realize that things happen. Banks arrest one of dozens the
[02:49:50.560 --> 02:49:55.680]  Alpharetta police made last month as part of a sting targeting sex trafficking in the metro.
[02:49:55.680 --> 02:50:03.440]  They actually had a 17-year-old juvenile female who was being forced into prostitution by her pimp.
[02:50:04.080 --> 02:50:10.480]  We were able to make that recovery. In fact, police and FBI agents worked in six metro counties
[02:50:10.480 --> 02:50:15.600]  to rescue victims of sex trafficking. An operation that resulted in the identification
[02:50:15.600 --> 02:50:21.840]  and rescue of 150 kids, including one. Let me explain something here.
[02:50:21.840 --> 02:50:28.880]  President Trump is not in the sex cults, ladies and gentlemen. Where was the story? I had some
[02:50:28.880 --> 02:50:34.880]  story here. Some guys talking about how degenerate Trump is. I think it was in this story.
[02:50:35.920 --> 02:50:40.160]  Talking about how degenerate Trump is. He can't control himself. He's this, that and the other
[02:50:40.160 --> 02:50:46.080]  thing. See if somebody can find that. I don't even know where it's coming from. President Trump,
[02:50:46.080 --> 02:50:50.080]  do you realize he doesn't drink or do drugs and never has? He's been sober his whole life.
[02:50:50.080 --> 02:50:56.000]  I can't say that. I don't know many people that could say that. I doubt there's any other president
[02:50:56.000 --> 02:50:59.280]  that could say that. But then they say President Trump is this, that and the other thing. When
[02:50:59.280 --> 02:51:07.520]  he is so much bigger than them, it's not even funny. And he is the one that has taken the handcuffs
[02:51:07.520 --> 02:51:12.480]  off of law enforcement when it comes to cracking down on the sex trafficking because he's not in
[02:51:12.480 --> 02:51:18.160]  the sex cults, folks. They've always been in the sex cults. Trump's not in the sex cults.
[02:51:18.160 --> 02:51:20.720]  That's why you're seeing these arrests. Let's go back to this report from Atlanta.
[02:51:48.480 --> 02:51:55.520]  Ann's uncle's the church, whoever it may be, to not let children
[02:51:57.360 --> 02:52:02.160]  fall away from those strongly centered circles of importance.
[02:52:04.480 --> 02:52:09.120]  And the Alfreda police tell us the man they arrested with that juvenile teenager is looking
[02:52:09.120 --> 02:52:14.640]  and facing federal charges. The FBI says the majority of the people arrested are facing charges
[02:52:14.640 --> 02:52:19.760]  in individual counties. Live in North Fulton County, Alfreda, Mike Picenic, Channel 2 Action News.
[02:52:19.760 --> 02:52:26.320]  So you have literally coast to coast from New York to Florida to California and everything in
[02:52:26.320 --> 02:52:33.920]  between massive arrests of pedophiles, massive arrests of sex traffickers, where we've had
[02:52:33.920 --> 02:52:41.360]  children found in cages, children found in dungeons, three months old found, I mean folks,
[02:52:41.360 --> 02:52:46.080]  you're talking some of the sickest, most twisted, disgusting behavior
[02:52:48.080 --> 02:52:50.800]  that gets protected by elements of our government.
[02:52:53.040 --> 02:52:59.680]  Some of which were probably involved in these sex cults that got even worse into
[02:52:59.680 --> 02:53:07.920]  Satanism and child ritualistic sacrifice and the spirit cookings, which all got exposed in
[02:53:07.920 --> 02:53:14.880]  the WikiLeaks. Now listen to the Polk County Sheriff talking about how real and disgusting
[02:53:16.480 --> 02:53:19.520]  these pedophiles and child pornographers really are.
[02:53:20.560 --> 02:53:26.800]  For you to understand what child pornography really is, and I'm not so sure that we say that often
[02:53:26.800 --> 02:53:32.400]  enough. Certainly there are people that think child pornography is quote unquote,
[02:53:32.400 --> 02:53:39.440]  kitty corn that is 16 or 17 year old girls who make themselves look a lot younger but they're
[02:53:39.440 --> 02:53:47.440]  really mature and that's not it at all. When we talk about child pornography and those that we've
[02:53:47.440 --> 02:53:55.200]  arrested today, they're either dealing in or possessing or trading or a combination of all
[02:53:55.200 --> 02:54:06.640]  of those things of pornography, child pornography, of children being raped, of babies as young as
[02:54:06.640 --> 02:54:16.080]  diapers being raped by adult males. This is the most horrific conduct you can ever understand
[02:54:16.080 --> 02:54:25.120]  in your entire life. These people have this. Now obviously we received information and that's
[02:54:25.120 --> 02:54:34.000]  why we investigated them. Just brutal to think about this. Brutal to think about infants.
[02:54:36.080 --> 02:54:45.040]  You just had another infant go missing in Virginia. What do you think the destiny now is for that
[02:54:45.040 --> 02:54:53.760]  child that got kidnapped? You have people close to Bill de Blasio, in fact the next John Podesta
[02:54:53.760 --> 02:55:00.480]  of the Democrat Party if you will, an aide to Bill de Blasio gets caught with terabytes
[02:55:01.680 --> 02:55:07.920]  of child pornography. You've got other arrests where I think it, I don't remember what it was.
[02:55:07.920 --> 02:55:13.520]  Honestly there have been so many. I can't remember all the different teachers, former mayors, this,
[02:55:13.520 --> 02:55:19.120]  that and the other thing politicians that get caught with this pedophile porn, this child porn,
[02:55:19.120 --> 02:55:29.520]  terabytes of it. You really have to think about that. You're talking about hours and hours of
[02:55:29.520 --> 02:55:38.800]  footage, folks. Think about everything that goes down for that to have to happen and you have to
[02:55:38.800 --> 02:55:43.760]  have some form of protection at the top. You have to have some sort of involvement at the top
[02:55:43.760 --> 02:55:50.640]  for all of this to be going on and gotten away with for decades and decades and decades.
[02:55:56.000 --> 02:56:02.240]  And then they want to come out and demonize and attack info wars because of pizza gate reporting.
[02:56:04.480 --> 02:56:08.160]  The crew is pulling up all the stories right now just flashing through all of it. Allen
[02:56:08.160 --> 02:56:14.720]  Mann caught with 58 terabytes of porn. Do you realize that's probably over hundreds of hours
[02:56:14.720 --> 02:56:20.320]  of child porn, ladies and gentlemen? Where the hell does that come from?
[02:56:24.160 --> 02:56:31.360]  How does the CIA and the FBI not find that? Oh, now they are. Ah, you see how that works.
[02:56:32.400 --> 02:56:36.800]  Yeah, there's Bill de Blasio's aide arrested for child porn. Don't forget about
[02:56:36.800 --> 02:56:43.680]  whom abiding husband Anthony Weiner busted for sexual activity with minors.
[02:56:46.640 --> 02:56:50.800]  Over 340 arrested in global child pornography investigation.
[02:56:51.920 --> 02:56:55.600]  How do you think this stuff goes on, folks? These people are protected
[02:56:57.040 --> 02:57:04.160]  by elements at the top of the food chain. You better believe it and they want to make a joke
[02:57:04.160 --> 02:57:10.640]  out of info wars reporting on the strange pizza references in the WikiLeaks emails when it comes

[03:00:11.360 --> 03:00:25.280]  welcome back to the alex jones show final segment that i'm with you here oh and shroy are filling
[03:00:25.280 --> 03:00:30.800]  in i'll be back tomorrow 11 a.m central god willing i'm sure alex jones will be filing reports as he
[03:00:30.800 --> 03:00:37.280]  is on the road on vacation a working vacation as usual and anthony kumia is going to take over
[03:00:37.280 --> 03:00:42.480]  on the other side of this segment but i wanted to cover this story real quick and i have to tell
[03:00:42.480 --> 03:00:49.680]  you i i try to do as much research into this to discover how much if any credit president
[03:00:49.680 --> 03:00:55.760]  trump deserves for this story and i gotta be honest they don't it's it's it's tough to it's tough to
[03:00:55.760 --> 03:01:02.560]  get this intelligence but the story was covered everywhere remarkable therapy beats terminal
[03:01:02.560 --> 03:01:09.280]  breast cancer so this woman for years has been told that she is going to die from this breast
[03:01:09.280 --> 03:01:16.080]  cancer it was terminal at one point she was even even given three months to live but then
[03:01:17.680 --> 03:01:25.040]  the us national national cancer institute decided to go ahead and try some experimental therapy on
[03:01:25.040 --> 03:01:34.800]  her and now it says it has saved her life and beaten the cancer now i was able to discover that
[03:01:35.440 --> 03:01:42.320]  they used this therapy on two others and they didn't make it however this was a first round of
[03:01:42.320 --> 03:01:47.600]  the experimental therapy where they basically just take your own immune cells and and and just
[03:01:48.400 --> 03:01:53.120]  at rapid and heavy doses put those back into your body to fight it and they turned out to be
[03:01:53.120 --> 03:02:00.000]  successful so they can try to repeat this and master this and this is all possible with
[03:02:00.000 --> 03:02:06.000]  president trump bringing about the experimental technology but i did a google search and i search
[03:02:06.000 --> 03:02:11.920]  this story and everything of the hundreds of articles that are covering this woman's miraculous
[03:02:11.920 --> 03:02:17.760]  recovery from cancer with the experimental therapy you know how many even mentioned trump
[03:02:17.760 --> 03:02:24.160]  giving out the right to now have the experimental therapy the experimental treatment on you with
[03:02:24.160 --> 03:02:30.240]  the right to try zero i found that incredible but let's go to the news report of this woman
[03:02:30.240 --> 03:02:34.720]  beating cancer with the experimental therapy experimental treatment for breast cancer that
[03:02:34.720 --> 03:02:43.200]  has saved a woman's life dr john lippu calls it a game changer they say into each life a little
[03:02:43.200 --> 03:02:50.080]  rain must fall rain's coming big rain we're 52 year old judy perkins it's been a monsoon
[03:02:50.640 --> 03:02:56.880]  i had a mastectomy i had all my lymph nodes out 10 years later 2013 which is what they want you to
[03:02:56.880 --> 03:03:03.040]  do another lump on the same side and this time it ended up being stage four so i entered the world of
[03:03:04.640 --> 03:03:09.840]  cancer patients see it pause it right there see isn't that amazing here she is talking about two
[03:03:09.840 --> 03:03:15.600]  therapies that everybody uses the mastectomies the chemo's hardly ever works horrible success rate
[03:03:15.600 --> 03:03:23.760]  in the long term then trump releases the experimental the experimental surgeries and you think it's a
[03:03:23.760 --> 03:03:30.000]  coincidence that now it's working let's go back to the clip patient despite hormonal and chemotherapy
[03:03:30.000 --> 03:03:37.120]  by 2015 the cancer had spread to her chest and liver i came to realize that i was going to die
[03:03:37.120 --> 03:03:45.280]  and that's where my mind was you know i felt bad for my family but i was grateful for the life i had
[03:03:45.280 --> 03:03:50.960]  had but then she found dr steven rozenberg at the national institutes of health so we're looking at
[03:03:50.960 --> 03:03:56.880]  lymphocytes he's a pioneer in harnessing the immune system to fight cancer genetic mutations
[03:03:56.880 --> 03:04:03.120]  in the cancer cell are the trigger causing those cells to grow out of control rozenberg's new approach
[03:04:03.120 --> 03:04:09.280]  is to find the few immune cells already in the body that can see those genetic mutations and
[03:04:09.280 --> 03:04:14.400]  multiply those cells into an army of cancer killers so this is how you find the needle in
[03:04:14.400 --> 03:04:20.320]  the haystack again here here's a lady that has been saved by experimental cancer treatment again
[03:04:20.320 --> 03:04:24.720]  whether or not you go to pull the video down you don't need to credit trump with this uh because
[03:04:24.720 --> 03:04:29.360]  this is something that perhaps was being worked on before but how do you not mention i'm telling you
[03:04:29.360 --> 03:04:34.080]  hundreds of stories covering this zero mentioned president trump signing the right to try which
[03:04:34.080 --> 03:04:38.480]  is going to bring more treatments and more therapies like this to the light and is going
[03:04:38.480 --> 03:04:45.120]  to save millions of people in the long aggregate and he doesn't even get mentioned in one story
[03:04:45.120 --> 03:04:50.720]  covering this successful experimental therapy beating cancer they will not even mention trump's name
[03:04:50.720 --> 03:05:00.080]  with good news ever the builder group consists of over 130 of the planet's most powerful people
[03:05:00.080 --> 03:05:05.920]  and it will meet in turn italy from june 7 through 10 for the annual gathering behind closed doors
[03:05:05.920 --> 03:05:11.440]  this year's topics include populism in europe the inequality challenge the future of work
[03:05:11.440 --> 03:05:18.240]  artificial intelligence the us before midterms russia of course and the post-truth world
[03:05:18.240 --> 03:05:23.040]  now this is where cnbc covers the builder group with the headline the secret of builder
[03:05:23.040 --> 03:05:27.760]  verge elite are worried about the post-truth world this is the mainstream media who once
[03:05:27.760 --> 03:05:32.560]  pretended the group didn't exist now that they're finally reporting on builder verge they're claiming
[03:05:32.560 --> 03:05:37.920]  the group is benevolent and cares about truth and objectivity while they meet in secret and take no
[03:05:37.920 --> 03:05:43.040]  minutes this is more likely that the group will discuss ways to use this post-truth world where
[03:05:43.040 --> 03:05:48.640]  feelings are more important than facts and reason to their advantage specifically as it pertains to
[03:05:48.640 --> 03:06:03.760]  the us before midterms leon macadoo info wars dot com you are listening to an info wars dot com

[03:08:06.880 --> 03:08:15.200]  and people who have a similar ideology to myself they say good good let them talk because uh all
[03:08:15.200 --> 03:08:24.240]  they're doing is bringing more people over to uh to our team they're so irrelevant they uh this high
[03:08:24.240 --> 03:08:33.360]  and mighty uh attitude the pandering did that's one thing i swear to you pandering by politicians
[03:08:33.360 --> 03:08:41.120]  celebrities what have you on social media drives me nuts especially when it's blatantly obvious
[03:08:41.120 --> 03:08:49.280]  the likes of a kathy griffin kathy griffin she put out a tweet after rozan got fired
[03:08:49.280 --> 03:08:56.000]  for a her tweet uh and they cancelled the new very popular rozan show uh we all know that
[03:08:56.800 --> 03:09:03.520]  but then uh uh she she tweets what what the hell did kathy griffin tweet something like
[03:09:04.480 --> 03:09:11.600]  uh hey there's so many writers and actors of color and those are the people that should be
[03:09:11.600 --> 03:09:20.960]  giving the the chance to do shows and i'm reading it just going oh do you have to be so ham-handed
[03:09:21.680 --> 03:09:29.360]  at your uh pandering to people and of course kathy griffin's another one that of course because of
[03:09:29.360 --> 03:09:38.720]  her leftist ideology uh got a pass she got a pass oh we all remember the the holding up the bloody
[03:09:38.720 --> 03:09:46.320]  head thing uh that outraged a lot of people there it is kathy griffin should be ashamed of herself
[03:09:46.320 --> 03:09:51.760]  my children especially my 11-year-old son baron are having a hard time with this sick that's what
[03:09:51.760 --> 03:09:58.960]  happened when uh the the severed head of donald trump uh a of course fake one albeit but uh it
[03:09:58.960 --> 03:10:04.800]  was quite disturbing to a lot of people and uh she got a little slap on the wrist i guess she
[03:10:04.800 --> 03:10:10.800]  wasn't able to hang out with uh anderson cooper on uh new yers eve which just sounds like a treat
[03:10:11.360 --> 03:10:16.640]  right there she wasn't able to do do that she got that gig canceled a bunch of other gigs got
[03:10:16.640 --> 03:10:26.640]  canceled but then uh under a year later she's back selling out uh venues here in new york city uh
[03:10:26.640 --> 03:10:36.080]  where i am the radio city musical she's playing radio city musical she gets to enjoy uh the rest
[03:10:36.080 --> 03:10:41.680]  of her career with a little speed bump maybe when when she initially did that but then the likes of
[03:10:41.680 --> 03:10:48.720]  people like louis ck who if you ask me yeah look we could all look at our own sexual deviancy and
[03:10:48.720 --> 03:10:55.680]  say all right we all have different things that might float our boat for um for louis ck it was uh
[03:10:55.680 --> 03:11:03.360]  apparently a pleasuring himself in front of uh young ladies so he did that a decade ago in aspen
[03:11:04.000 --> 03:11:11.360]  and uh they was consensual the girls kind of sat there and chuckled not my cup of tea uh
[03:11:11.360 --> 03:11:18.240]  for what floats my boat but uh he did that and 10 years later these girls lose their mind they
[03:11:18.240 --> 03:11:26.720]  say they were affected by it this that the other thing and louis ck is in exile he is in entertainment
[03:11:26.720 --> 03:11:35.280]  exile uh one of the funniest guys i know he's hilarious a good guy i've i've uh known him and
[03:11:35.280 --> 03:11:42.880]  hung out with him a few times uh with the opium anthony show a few years back um just a guy and
[03:11:42.880 --> 03:11:49.600]  he's in exile because of the me too movement and all that it all depends on what side politically
[03:11:50.400 --> 03:11:58.240]  you you are uh attached to and that will dictate whether your life is utterly and completely destroyed
[03:11:59.120 --> 03:12:07.680]  or whether you're able to just say uh some phony apology like kathy griffin did and then come back
[03:12:07.680 --> 03:12:14.880]  withdraw your apology and you're selling out places like radio city music hall uh if people
[03:12:14.880 --> 03:12:22.240]  don't see this if their eyes aren't open enough to see that there is a horrific double standard
[03:12:23.360 --> 03:12:30.160]  and mind you i don't want anyone fired i am a free speech absolutist i think whatever you say
[03:12:30.160 --> 03:12:35.840]  especially in the realm of comedy fair game if you're expressing yourself no matter how
[03:12:35.840 --> 03:12:40.800]  vulgar some people find it how offensive some people find it i personally don't think you
[03:12:40.800 --> 03:12:45.760]  should be fired from your job i don't think expressing yourself through uh freedom of
[03:12:45.760 --> 03:12:53.040]  speech or freedom of expression should uh result in in your career ending for anybody i don't care
[03:12:53.040 --> 03:13:02.160]  where you fall in the uh political spectrum but the left apparently just loves destroying careers
[03:13:02.160 --> 03:13:09.920]  and moving on to the next one like like a swarm of locusts uh for a day they they land on somebody
[03:13:10.480 --> 03:13:16.560]  pick them clean and then move on to the next thing and um if you don't think it's politically
[03:13:16.560 --> 03:13:24.400]  motivated and that uh some people are are much more equal than others and that uh certain people
[03:13:24.400 --> 03:13:32.880]  really really have the reins of uh mainstream media entertainment uh television broadcasting
[03:13:33.920 --> 03:13:44.240]  it really you have to be blind not to say it uh hollywood itself is a zoo it's a zoo they preach
[03:13:44.240 --> 03:13:55.680]  to us about our um uh sexuality how we we have to uh reign in our um what do they call it toxic
[03:13:55.680 --> 03:14:05.200]  masculinity oh my god i saw a stupid tweet by chelsea clinton the other day and and by stupid
[03:14:05.200 --> 03:14:13.040]  tweet i mean anything the girl ever tweets is a stupid tweet but she's saying um about her son
[03:14:13.040 --> 03:14:18.960]  she goes i'm raising my son talk about pandering i'm raising my son as a feminist
[03:14:20.960 --> 03:14:29.360]  and and this tweet was yesterday the anniversary of d-day the day of days the invasion of normandy
[03:14:29.360 --> 03:14:39.920]  during world war two and uh that mindset of those men there's a great shot of general eisenhower
[03:14:39.920 --> 03:14:47.440]  addressing the men in england before they are to hit those boats and go over and uh most probably
[03:14:47.440 --> 03:14:53.280]  die or be horribly injured and then she's talking i want to raise my son as a feminist
[03:14:53.840 --> 03:15:00.560]  washington hollywood they're all mental patients because if you think for a second there it is
[03:15:00.560 --> 03:15:06.800]  you think for a second that those men standing there watching their general address them before
[03:15:06.800 --> 03:15:10.800]  or what would probably amount to be the most horrid day in their lives
[03:15:12.160 --> 03:15:18.400]  thought that that years and years later we'd be talking about raising our men as feminists
[03:15:18.960 --> 03:15:28.400]  gender fluidity raising children uh boys as girls i i don't know if they'd get on the boats
[03:15:29.360 --> 03:15:33.680]  i don't know if they would have got on that landing craft thinking that that's what they'd

[03:20:36.080 --> 03:20:43.440]  they're losing their minds i didn't think this hissy fit would last this long but now i'm convinced
[03:20:43.440 --> 03:20:51.600]  it will last until uh donald trump uh walks across that lawn gets in that helicopter
[03:20:52.880 --> 03:21:00.400]  and leaves office um after his second term after so so they they're going to be going through
[03:21:00.400 --> 03:21:07.760]  what is an eight-year hissy fit they're losing their minds and it doesn't seem to be slowing down
[03:21:07.760 --> 03:21:13.920]  i enjoy it most of my twitter follows people that i follow on twitter are what i call a hate
[03:21:13.920 --> 03:21:21.760]  follows i love reading things that upset me i don't know why maybe i'm mental but i'll tell
[03:21:21.760 --> 03:21:29.440]  you why when i sit there and scroll through the tweets of elissa malano john cusack share
[03:21:29.440 --> 03:21:40.880]  uh roseo donald bet middler these are all people i follow just to get angry just to get worked up
[03:21:40.880 --> 03:21:51.520]  and i revel in their insanity and their sadness i i enjoy that part of it uh let's look at uh john
[03:21:51.520 --> 03:22:01.920]  cusack first um left-wing actor that's um putting it mildly john cusack calls for a coup
[03:22:02.560 --> 03:22:11.360]  against president trump hit the streets is this allowed i don't know i know we have a
[03:22:11.360 --> 03:22:16.000]  certain freedoms in this country but i know there are certain things that are not covered
[03:22:16.000 --> 03:22:23.680]  is calling for a a coup against the president and um telling people to hit the streets cusack was a
[03:22:23.680 --> 03:22:32.240]  big star in the 80s and 90s now he has a reputation for being a far left moon bat a moon bat who enjoys
[03:22:32.240 --> 03:22:37.840]  blocking conservatives on twitter thank god my account has been suspended uh or permanently
[03:22:37.840 --> 03:22:45.520]  suspended three times so i am i'm on a new account that he hasn't blocked yet uh because again i i
[03:22:45.520 --> 03:22:54.720]  revel i revel in this nonsense um recently however he said some things he may come to regret uh
[03:22:54.720 --> 03:22:59.120]  actor john cusack embarked on twitter ran tuesday night in which he called for the american people
[03:22:59.120 --> 03:23:05.280]  to stage an overthrow of president donald trump's presidency over the immigration policy what did
[03:23:05.280 --> 03:23:13.520]  he say during his tirade cusack called trump ill deranged and dangerous they uh whenever they come
[03:23:13.520 --> 03:23:17.360]  out with stuff like this because oh donald does this all the time too rosie does this all the time
[03:23:17.360 --> 03:23:24.000]  calls him a mental patient and then she proceeds to post things that are absolutely insane uh
[03:23:24.000 --> 03:23:29.360]  yeah he's and suggested to the people uh that they take to the streets where civil disobedience
[03:23:29.360 --> 03:23:37.280]  occurs so i guess he's telling people to riot i don't know go out there take the streets hit the
[03:23:37.280 --> 03:23:45.200]  streets and uh and try to overthrow the president of the united states if it was anybody but john
[03:23:45.200 --> 03:23:52.880]  cusack uh we might have to worry i don't know how many people he influences these days uh perhaps he
[03:23:52.880 --> 03:23:57.040]  could get in front of the white house and hold up the big boombox there he is he could hold up the
[03:23:57.040 --> 03:24:02.880]  big boombox in front of the white house until trump uh comes out calls him an obscenity and walks back
[03:24:02.880 --> 03:24:11.360]  in his house because trump could care less what the likes of john cusack has to say uh but it is
[03:24:11.360 --> 03:24:21.120]  this this whole wave of celebrities uh speaking out against the president and calling him a mental
[03:24:21.120 --> 03:24:28.160]  patient and saying that he's deranged and he's a racist and and his his immigration policy is
[03:24:28.160 --> 03:24:36.400]  illegal it it they never seem to be uh actors or actresses on at the top of their game let's say
[03:24:37.040 --> 03:24:43.920]  they're never those when you look at uh another one elissa malano elissa malano has been on this
[03:24:43.920 --> 03:24:51.120]  of course the me too movement she was fine and dandy uh before the me too movement started
[03:24:51.120 --> 03:24:58.480]  you rarely heard anything out of her stupid yap but uh now you know she's she found she found
[03:24:58.480 --> 03:25:06.240]  another mission in life she's in her 40s i guess and i guess you know the roles kind of dry up for
[03:25:06.240 --> 03:25:13.360]  a woman in her 40s that was known for just showing her breasts on uh tell of it after who's the boss
[03:25:14.080 --> 03:25:19.360]  she did some movies that uh what was it oh elissa malano is in that when you heard elissa malano
[03:25:19.360 --> 03:25:23.680]  was in a movie did you think oh wow i'm i think i'm going to see an oscar winning performance
[03:25:24.320 --> 03:25:30.320]  no you said i think i'm going to see her huge breasts on on the screen and that and maybe
[03:25:30.320 --> 03:25:37.040]  that's why you watched it so uh those roles uh dry up and then she decides she's going to uh
[03:25:38.160 --> 03:25:45.120]  be an activist they all turn into activists who's that other nut that co-starred with her on that
[03:25:45.120 --> 03:25:52.720]  show charmed uh what what was her name rose McGowan rose McGowan rose McGowan's another
[03:25:52.720 --> 03:25:58.560]  kook they just lose their minds the second the phone stops ringing from their agent
[03:25:58.560 --> 03:26:06.240]  with roles where they can show their breasts they turn into activists it's ridiculous so um
[03:26:07.600 --> 03:26:13.600]  there are unbelievable amounts of pictures of uh elissa malano with harvey weinstein by the way
[03:26:13.600 --> 03:26:19.120]  and those stories were no big secret everyone in hollywood knew harvey weinstein was a predator
[03:26:20.080 --> 03:26:25.760]  did they say anything no of course not why harvey weinstein got people work good work
[03:26:25.760 --> 03:26:33.360]  made a lot of people a lot of money and until uh the jig was up and he was uh cast out everyone
[03:26:33.360 --> 03:26:38.800]  kept their mouths shut elissa malano wasn't saying anything about harvey weinstein until
[03:26:38.800 --> 03:26:44.320]  everyone was saying something about harvey weinstein and then you put a hashtag me too or
[03:26:44.320 --> 03:26:51.600]  some other nonsense and uh you're an activist so uh she's uh doing a lot with the remember the
[03:26:51.600 --> 03:26:58.880]  e r a the equal rights amendment back in the 70s this was uh women that wanted equal rights
[03:26:58.880 --> 03:27:04.960]  there was still uh there was still certain things uh that were um strictly for men and women uh
[03:27:04.960 --> 03:27:11.760]  weren't really welcome uh that all changed during the 70s in 80s and uh women now have
[03:27:11.760 --> 03:27:17.440]  every single right that everyone else in this country has whether you're a minority as long
[03:27:17.440 --> 03:27:23.760]  as you're an american citizen uh you have these inalienable rights women have them minorities
[03:27:23.760 --> 03:27:30.880]  have them men have them we all have them so what the hell is she talking about well let me tell
[03:27:30.880 --> 03:27:39.680]  you a little something about equality equality stinks no one no one that has fought for equality
[03:27:39.680 --> 03:27:47.920]  for decades wants equality because once they get there they realize it stinks what is equality
[03:27:47.920 --> 03:27:53.280]  well people can make fun of you people can ignore you people don't have to pay attention to you
[03:27:53.280 --> 03:27:58.640]  you're not special anymore you're equal you're just like everyone else well when people realize
[03:27:58.640 --> 03:28:06.080]  that they don't stop now they've reached equality no they you want to be special everyone that fought
[03:28:06.080 --> 03:28:14.080]  for equal rights doesn't want that they want to be special whether you're a feminist uh whether
[03:28:14.080 --> 03:28:23.200]  you're uh an uh immigrants or or sexuality you know you're gay you want you want to be special
[03:28:23.200 --> 03:28:30.240]  because equality means you're just like everyone else and that's boring and you can't be flamboyant
[03:28:30.240 --> 03:28:36.400]  and you can't demand things you just sit on the train on your way to work just like everyone else
[03:28:36.400 --> 03:28:41.520]  and you're not special well no one likes the sound of that so they go above and beyond equal
[03:28:42.240 --> 03:28:45.600]  and that's what they want so when you hear people wanting equal rights we all have it
[03:28:46.800 --> 03:28:50.800]  we'll be back in a matter of moments to talk about the great and powerful donald trump
[03:28:50.800 --> 03:28:56.560]  uh be right back anthony comey and four wars healthcare reform is confusing but whether it's

[03:32:08.480 --> 03:32:14.160]  restaurants by 2020 this is seen as a pushback move against the left's demands for $15 an hour
[03:32:14.160 --> 03:32:19.600]  minimum wage ceo steve easterbrook that the decision is aimed at modernizing the company

[03:35:51.680 --> 03:35:58.880]  their minds they fantasize about killing the president of the united states they've done this
[03:35:59.520 --> 03:36:05.520]  since day one they've done it since the announcement of his candidacy and then once he was uh
[03:36:05.520 --> 03:36:12.240]  elected and then inaugurated we saw people literally crying in the streets and then
[03:36:12.240 --> 03:36:21.360]  uh these maniacs come out and and have these these fantasies of of assassinating the president
[03:36:24.320 --> 03:36:28.400]  could you even i've said this so many times and i know so many people are sick of hearing it
[03:36:28.400 --> 03:36:35.680]  because it's it's a blatantly obvious hypocrisy that we look at but could you imagine flip that
[03:36:35.680 --> 03:36:47.520]  around and have this fantasy and and recordings plays in in in central park and films made
[03:36:47.520 --> 03:36:53.680]  that depicted barack obama being killed like that was something that the entertainment world
[03:36:53.680 --> 03:37:02.480]  embraced and just put out there you you couldn't imagine the wrath that would be uh laid out
[03:37:02.480 --> 03:37:08.240]  out to these people that would have uh done something like that but with donald trump it's
[03:37:08.240 --> 03:37:17.200]  just i mean remember years ago uh when when uh a little like a a a reticle from a scope
[03:37:17.760 --> 03:37:23.360]  crosshairs were put in a picture or an article and people would lose their minds you're saying
[03:37:24.560 --> 03:37:28.960]  that that person should be killed you you're inspiring assassins and murderers
[03:37:28.960 --> 03:37:35.760]  and then this it's just blatant it's right out there it's not even it's not even up for debate
[03:37:35.760 --> 03:37:42.960]  what it is they fantasize about murdering the president of the united states they're mental
[03:37:42.960 --> 03:37:51.680]  patience and for what honestly for what some of trump's statements things he said when he was
[03:37:51.680 --> 03:38:00.400]  an entertainer on television things he said years and years ago decades ago uh he's he's proven
[03:38:01.120 --> 03:38:08.400]  that he's an effective president of this country an outstanding economy oh my god are we chugging
[03:38:08.400 --> 03:38:14.960]  along unemployment all-time lows just record lows they're having a hard time finding people
[03:38:14.960 --> 03:38:23.520]  to fill the amount of jobs that are uh that are available in this country uh today we said
[03:38:23.520 --> 03:38:32.000]  the guy first of all is a workhorse it's unbelievable yesterday again on the anniversary
[03:38:32.000 --> 03:38:41.360]  of the d-day he signs a bill giving our veterans the ability to get the the medical care they need
[03:38:41.360 --> 03:38:49.040]  outside of uh va doctors if they have something they need immediate attention for they're able
[03:38:49.040 --> 03:38:57.280]  to get it it's and then the next day today he's meeting with the leader of japan to talk about
[03:38:57.840 --> 03:39:05.760]  the upcoming korea summit which is happening next tuesday it who who's against this
[03:39:05.760 --> 03:39:16.640]  who's complaining about this president it seems like every other day he's actually doing something
[03:39:16.640 --> 03:39:23.120]  that is having a real effect he doesn't get up and make these speeches of promises that
[03:39:23.120 --> 03:39:32.160]  just never come to fruition he's doing stuff and and the left cannot take it and some people on
[03:39:32.160 --> 03:39:40.320]  the right he is showing people he has ripped the cover off of politicians and and what they have
[03:39:40.320 --> 03:39:48.880]  been doing just bamboozling everybody for decades upon decades they get elected on promises they do
[03:39:48.880 --> 03:39:56.160]  nothing uh they immediately try to get reelected to continue doing nothing and we've just thought
[03:39:56.160 --> 03:40:02.320]  that was how it works how the hell are the american people going to look at a president
[03:40:02.320 --> 03:40:10.160]  after trump is done that gets up to a podium and starts that politis speech thing we as a nation
[03:40:10.960 --> 03:40:18.720]  need to come together so we may and i like all that phoniness i like when trump goes
[03:40:18.720 --> 03:40:24.240]  yeah and we have a lot more people on the border when they come over get him out get him the hell
[03:40:24.240 --> 03:40:31.040]  out he's standing it's the president at his podium saying get them the hell out like a real human
[03:40:31.040 --> 03:40:37.760]  being is talking are you actually going to be able to watch a politician stand in a lectern
[03:40:37.760 --> 03:40:44.800]  and just bs us the way that that had been done for for decades i don't know i'm not gonna be able
[03:40:44.800 --> 03:40:49.680]  to watch that and actually take the the person seriously and as far as getting things done
[03:40:49.680 --> 03:40:56.720]  and that obama worked on that obama care it was his entire two terms his entire two terms
[03:40:56.720 --> 03:41:03.200]  to try to get one thing done and when it finally was done it was terrible that in the iran i ran
[03:41:03.200 --> 03:41:09.680]  deal which we all know how horrible that is and we're finding out on a daily basis how much more
[03:41:09.680 --> 03:41:16.960]  horrible that deal was apparently obama opened up our entire financial system to the iranians
[03:41:16.960 --> 03:41:25.680]  just saying yeah come on in like they're gonna play it honestly and and that was uh kept quiet by
[03:41:25.680 --> 03:41:32.000]  obama and john carry that was a little inside a deal that i don't believe congress even knew about
[03:41:33.280 --> 03:41:38.240]  so uh that's all gonna come yeah look at this obama administration gave iran secret access
[03:41:38.240 --> 03:41:46.160]  to u.s financial system this is criminal stuff and then what is obama what is uh uh trump doing
[03:41:46.160 --> 03:41:52.400]  right signing a bill to allow terminally ill patients uh experimental drugs
[03:41:54.000 --> 03:42:02.560]  who's against that securing our borders against invaders people that uh aren't uh legally coming
[03:42:02.560 --> 03:42:07.600]  in here getting people that have crossed over illegally the hell out like he said
[03:42:07.600 --> 03:42:19.760]  asia i mean he's he's sparked up relationships with north korea china japan in a way where
[03:42:19.760 --> 03:42:26.400]  they're actually talking about peace on the korean peninsula for the first time since the korean
[03:42:26.400 --> 03:42:35.680]  war it's astounding and then you you listen to polosi and warren and the rest of them schumer
[03:42:35.680 --> 03:42:42.720]  and all you hear about is we're running on the platform of raising your taxes opening the borders
[03:42:42.720 --> 03:42:48.160]  it's like a madhouse who's voting for them i guess we'll see in the midterms uh be back
[03:42:48.160 --> 03:42:57.200]  in a second anthony kovia info wars dot com living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really
[03:42:57.200 --> 03:43:02.800]  is the real drama can be found here in leilani estates but a lot of us on the big island rely
[03:43:02.800 --> 03:43:09.360]  on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy
[03:43:09.360 --> 03:43:15.760]  metal particles and acid rain could lower the ph of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we
[03:43:15.760 --> 03:43:22.240]  employed a series of tests for heavy metals alkalinity and ph what we learned was that there
[03:43:22.240 --> 03:43:28.400]  was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next we tested the water
[03:43:28.400 --> 03:43:34.240]  from our alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure
[03:43:34.240 --> 03:43:41.040]  but the ph was also restored to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the alexa pure
[03:43:41.040 --> 03:43:47.200]  raises the ph of the water so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate
[03:43:47.200 --> 03:43:54.640]  a rainwater supply but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it info wars

[03:47:42.640 --> 03:47:49.840]  bill clinton's interview and they asked him about monica lawinsky and uh all that hubbub and uh i
[03:47:49.840 --> 03:47:58.000]  found it sad i found it sad and not for the content really he uh he still all these years later he's
[03:47:58.000 --> 03:48:04.480]  skirting around he's still slick willy he's a little slower in his step but he's still slick willy
[03:48:04.480 --> 03:48:13.840]  slick willy won't really fess up the things won't really apologize and in 2018 this hashtag me too
[03:48:13.840 --> 03:48:22.720]  movement uh he's just a dinosaur he's really a dinosaur it's uh he is the definition of workplace
[03:48:23.440 --> 03:48:31.520]  sexual harassment he's a guy that had literally the most power on the face of the earth you
[03:48:31.520 --> 03:48:38.480]  could not find anyone on this planet more powerful than bill clinton when he held office
[03:48:38.480 --> 03:48:46.880]  of the president of the united states going after a white house intern a white house intern
[03:48:46.880 --> 03:48:59.440]  that is as sexually harassing somebody as as you can get and uh for some reason uh feminists just
[03:48:59.440 --> 03:49:05.600]  adore this guy and when hillary was running of course we remember um when she was running for
[03:49:05.600 --> 03:49:14.720]  president uh they didn't utter a peep about uh her sticking up for her husband bad mouthing the
[03:49:14.720 --> 03:49:24.320]  women that um alleged a sexual harassment at the very least some alleging rape um from bill clinton
[03:49:24.320 --> 03:49:32.080]  uh but it wasn't quite the the content of the interview we see him a lot of times we see him
[03:49:32.080 --> 03:49:39.200]  on the news he's waving but we rarely rarely get to hear him these days and i remember like
[03:49:39.200 --> 03:49:45.440]  remember bill back in the old days with the finger and the whole uh let me tell you i'll
[03:49:45.440 --> 03:49:53.040]  come from a little town named hope and it was like uh he was just yeah then and now and now he
[03:49:53.040 --> 03:50:02.320]  was sitting there like i apologize the monocular whiskey it's like living with hillary ages you
[03:50:02.320 --> 03:50:09.040]  in dog years like she just sucks maybe that machine on her back that she's covering up in
[03:50:09.040 --> 03:50:15.200]  90 degree weather with a coat and uh a scarf maybe that's something that just sucks the life
[03:50:15.840 --> 03:50:21.360]  out of people around her so when her knee goes bad and she falls down or when her
[03:50:21.360 --> 03:50:26.720]  balance is off and she collapses she could just suck it out of people it's an alien technology
[03:50:27.360 --> 03:50:33.200]  i have no idea i'm speculating of course but it was a little sad uh i would be remiss in my
[03:50:33.200 --> 03:50:39.360]  duties here on info wars dot com if i didn't tell you about something uh in the technical world
[03:50:39.360 --> 03:50:46.560]  that is invading your privacy uh and i we knew this all the time we love carrying around
[03:50:46.560 --> 03:50:56.560]  our uh tracking devices whatever brand you pick iphone samsung whatever it is uh we love we can't
[03:50:56.560 --> 03:51:02.560]  leave without our tracking device on a daily basis could you imagine when i was growing up if someone
[03:51:02.560 --> 03:51:10.080]  told me yeah we're gonna have a device that uh listens to your your conversations uh you carried
[03:51:10.080 --> 03:51:15.760]  around with you it could track where you are where you're going where you've been uh all that
[03:51:15.760 --> 03:51:22.560]  information will be available to law enforcement and you'd go get out of here i'm not allowing that
[03:51:22.560 --> 03:51:30.560]  allowing that they figured out a way where if we leave our tracking device at home we will turn
[03:51:30.560 --> 03:51:39.200]  around to pick it up and take it with us that's how it's done that's how it's done there's no
[03:51:39.200 --> 03:51:46.720]  implanting of a chip no government agent comes to your door open up i'm here to implant the tracking
[03:51:46.720 --> 03:51:56.160]  chip in your arm no that's nuts now slowly they build up this device over the course of the years
[03:51:56.160 --> 03:52:05.120]  where you can't be without it you want to have it you want the tracking device because it's so
[03:52:05.120 --> 03:52:12.480]  convenient and you have to do important things like show everyone a picture of your lunch so you
[03:52:12.480 --> 03:52:18.240]  can perish the thought you leave your house without your show people a picture of my lunch machine
[03:52:18.240 --> 03:52:26.480]  which also is a tracking device well this came out your phone is listening and it's not paranoia
[03:52:26.480 --> 03:52:35.920]  and it's also not only when you say siri or google okay google or hey siri um other apps on your phone
[03:52:35.920 --> 03:52:42.080]  which you download and then a little thing comes up and it says would you like to give this app
[03:52:42.080 --> 03:52:50.080]  permission to maybe uh see what your location is and you go sure i'll give it that uh would you like
[03:52:50.080 --> 03:52:54.960]  uh this would you like to activate your microphone that's the one would you like this
[03:52:54.960 --> 03:53:01.120]  app to uh be able to use your microphone it's like well i have to talk to it so i guess sure
[03:53:01.840 --> 03:53:09.280]  well there it is while things like uh siri and google tell you by the way that you have to say
[03:53:09.280 --> 03:53:13.920]  those trigger words before it starts listening to your conversation which i don't believe in it for
[03:53:13.920 --> 03:53:20.000]  for a second but these other apps will just turn on whenever the hell they damn well please
[03:53:20.000 --> 03:53:27.440]  damn well please they can't even tell you what the trigger words are that will turn the device's
[03:53:27.440 --> 03:53:34.560]  mic on and send that information to a third party app which then in turn can sell it to whoever the
[03:53:34.560 --> 03:53:41.600]  hell they please or maybe even give it to law enforcement and the old adage of well if i did
[03:53:41.600 --> 03:53:47.680]  nothing wrong why should i worry about what i'm saying because the definition of what you did
[03:53:47.680 --> 03:53:55.520]  wrong is so different in 2018 than maybe it was even a few years ago a political affiliation
[03:53:56.080 --> 03:54:04.240]  an ideology is now wrong and those things as we have seen can absolutely be used against you to
[03:54:04.240 --> 03:54:13.440]  destroy your career your reputation maybe even your relationships of course but your phone is
[03:54:13.440 --> 03:54:21.040]  listening to you um from time to time snippets of audio go back to these other apps like facebook
[03:54:21.040 --> 03:54:27.360]  by the way uh they go back to those servers uh and there's no official understanding of what
[03:54:27.360 --> 03:54:36.240]  the triggers are whether it's a timing or location based or uses a usage of certain functions it's
[03:54:36.240 --> 03:54:46.160]  it's spying on you this thing you cannot go a day without is literally spying on you and sending
[03:54:46.160 --> 03:54:55.840]  that information off to you don't even know who uh a little scary everything that invades every
[03:54:55.840 --> 03:55:02.640]  technology that invades our privacy on a daily basis is presented to you as a convenience
[03:55:02.640 --> 03:55:09.600]  it will always be a convenience don't think that like i said an agent of this shadowy
[03:55:09.600 --> 03:55:15.040]  government is going to knock on your door and ask you for some of your liberties and freedoms
[03:55:15.040 --> 03:55:24.480]  it doesn't work that way easy pass was something that uh you know the remembering waiting online
[03:55:24.480 --> 03:55:31.920]  to throw change into a basket or hand it to some doofus behind some glass while the traffic
[03:55:31.920 --> 03:55:38.800]  is backed up for miles and then it's like well we got this thing you put it in your car and now
[03:55:38.800 --> 03:55:45.200]  you just zoom right through it's convenient you want one right sure i do well what's it doing
[03:55:45.200 --> 03:55:52.320]  tracking where you've been where you're going when you went there it could be used in divorce cases
[03:55:52.320 --> 03:56:01.520]  criminal cases all of it so you gave up a liberty you gave up a privacy for the ability to not be
[03:56:01.520 --> 03:56:10.560]  in a line for a length of time and uh that again no one knocked on your door you did it voluntarily
[03:56:12.080 --> 03:56:19.680]  things like on star the same thing you don't think for a second that you you have to say or push a
[03:56:19.680 --> 03:56:25.280]  button or say hey on star and and it starts listening to you why because they told you that
[03:56:25.280 --> 03:56:32.640]  that because they told you that it's like when the news tells you the most trusted team in news
[03:56:32.640 --> 03:56:39.120]  who's telling you that this team well how am i supposed to believe that because we're saying it
[03:56:40.000 --> 03:56:46.720]  and when they tell you they're not listening to you why would you believe it and i'm just
[03:56:46.720 --> 03:56:52.960]  this guilty i brought one of those uh lexie units in my house i finally unplugged the goddamn thing
[03:56:52.960 --> 03:57:00.880]  unplugged it it was answering things that weren't being said it was talking back to the television
[03:57:00.880 --> 03:57:09.120]  which is also listening to me all of these devices now are spying on us and whether it's for some
[03:57:09.120 --> 03:57:20.400]  nefarious weird globalist uh uh plan or it's just to sell your information to retailers it's still
[03:57:20.400 --> 03:57:30.080]  spying on you and it's infringing on your privacy and we all do it voluntarily because it's convenient
