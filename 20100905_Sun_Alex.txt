[00:00.000 --> 00:08.200]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the Information War continues.
[00:08.200 --> 00:11.200]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:11.200 --> 00:23.600]  Welcome my friends, welcome and thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:23.600 --> 00:29.400]  It is Sunday, the 5th day of September 2010, we're gonna be live here for the next two
[00:29.400 --> 00:40.200]  hours simulcasting the syndicated radio broadcast in full living video color at prisonplanet.tv.
[00:40.200 --> 00:50.720]  Today I am going to open a first salvo in an investigation of the neocons and a Republican
[00:50.720 --> 00:57.640]  party who are set to be sweet back into the house and probably the Senate in November
[00:57.640 --> 01:03.520]  of this year in only two months.
[01:03.520 --> 01:08.680]  We're also going to look at the falling fortunes of the Democrats who have shown themselves
[01:08.680 --> 01:19.440]  to be cohorts with the globalist yet again in their attempt to collectivize this nation.
[01:19.440 --> 01:25.520]  Now about two weeks ago I started getting calls and seeing reviews saying that Glenn
[01:25.520 --> 01:34.440]  Beck's New New York Times bestselling book The Overton Window was important for me to
[01:34.440 --> 01:41.840]  read and I've now had a chance to read it and Glenn Beck is even more dangerous than
[01:41.840 --> 01:43.080]  I had first thought.
[01:43.080 --> 01:52.440]  This is extremely sophisticated and is the equivalent of O'Brien, the inner party torture
[01:52.440 --> 02:00.440]  master in 1984 telling Winston Smith, one of the inner party propagandists, giving him
[02:00.440 --> 02:06.920]  a book revealing the entire program of enslavement and dehumanization and then arresting Winston
[02:06.920 --> 02:11.040]  and torturing him for reading the book that they gave him.
[02:11.040 --> 02:20.000]  This is a revelation of the method and I'm going to be covering that later in this hour.
[02:20.000 --> 02:26.040]  Now it integrates into machete.
[02:26.040 --> 02:33.800]  Robert Rodriguez's new film, number two at the box office this weekend, opened on Friday
[02:33.800 --> 02:37.480]  and it was even worse than what the initial script stated.
[02:37.480 --> 02:46.080]  It is that script word for word and more, Robert Rodriguez is a liar.
[02:46.080 --> 02:50.040]  He lied and said the Arizona trailer for the movie three months ago had nothing to do with
[02:50.040 --> 02:53.480]  the film, wasn't in the film, that's not true.
[02:53.480 --> 03:00.400]  He said that they'd cut the race war stuff, no they even added more and it deals with
[03:00.400 --> 03:08.560]  how the globalists are controlling our society by manipulating both sides in the false debate.
[03:08.560 --> 03:15.560]  News Corp that owns Fox News produced this movie and has released it.
[03:15.560 --> 03:19.120]  On the other end, they've got Glenn Beck.
[03:19.120 --> 03:21.280]  This is how they control the system.
[03:21.280 --> 03:25.960]  They control both ends of the spectrum and Glenn Beck and his book goes as far as to
[03:25.960 --> 03:30.560]  admit that.
[03:30.560 --> 03:38.360]  This is mind control so sophisticated that it even staggers my mind.
[03:38.360 --> 03:42.440]  I study this 24 seven and I understand it.
[03:42.440 --> 03:44.280]  It's hard to articulate though.
[03:44.280 --> 03:49.720]  The most sophisticated propaganda PR minds in the world have developed this system and
[03:49.720 --> 03:54.280]  Beck admits it all.
[03:54.280 --> 04:00.800]  Carol Quigley, Bernays, Gerbils.
[04:00.800 --> 04:05.680]  When you've studied propaganda, it's horrifying to watch it unfold.
[04:05.680 --> 04:15.840]  The Democratic and Republican parties work for the exact same groups and it's the globalist
[04:15.840 --> 04:19.640]  playing different populations off against each other and divide and conquer.
[04:19.640 --> 04:21.880]  But divide and conquer is just a term.
[04:21.880 --> 04:24.680]  It goes so much further than just that.
[04:24.680 --> 04:26.760]  So this is going to be a very important broadcast.
[04:26.760 --> 04:39.480]  I'm going to hit on a bunch of other news first and then also get into machete and then
[04:39.480 --> 04:45.440]  we will get into Beck because the Republicans are going to take power and if you hold your
[04:45.440 --> 04:55.320]  breath and look for things to really change, you're going to exfistiate.
[04:55.320 --> 05:04.120]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with
[05:04.120 --> 05:08.720]  your self-produced colloidal silver solutions yet many are unaware of the entire function
[05:08.720 --> 05:12.560]  of the Silver Lungs system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions
[05:12.560 --> 05:15.240]  anywhere in or on the body.
[05:15.240 --> 05:20.000]  My name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs generator.
[05:20.000 --> 05:24.600]  Not only does the Silver Lungs system produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions,
[05:24.600 --> 05:29.240]  it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver
[05:29.240 --> 05:32.760]  solutions directly to key target areas.
[05:32.760 --> 05:39.520]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin and orally for the digestive
[05:39.520 --> 05:40.520]  system.
[05:40.520 --> 05:47.920]  Be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the Silver Lungs system at www.silverlungs.com
[05:47.920 --> 05:51.000]  to learn more about how the Silver Lungs system works.
[05:51.000 --> 05:59.880]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have, that's www.silverlungs.com.
[05:59.880 --> 06:05.800]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's
[06:05.800 --> 06:18.760]  a war on for your mind.
[06:18.760 --> 06:25.280]  Thank you for joining us, my friends, it is Sunday, the 5th day of September, 2010.
[06:25.280 --> 06:33.600]  We're going to go over the latest economic news, world news, police state news.
[06:33.600 --> 06:40.120]  Google is being investigated for antitrust by the state of Texas for reportedly manipulating
[06:40.120 --> 06:47.280]  their search function towards their sponsors, which the state of Texas claims is a violation
[06:47.280 --> 06:49.280]  of the antitrust act.
[06:49.280 --> 06:52.200]  Well, of course, they manipulate their search functions.
[06:52.200 --> 06:57.320]  They routinely, one of our stories is the top search, delete it and admit that they're
[06:57.320 --> 07:03.240]  deleting it and block entire articles we write at www.prisonplanet.com and www.infoowars.com.
[07:03.240 --> 07:06.520]  Of course, Google is doing this.
[07:06.520 --> 07:12.240]  There's also a new campaign out with television ads pointing out the fact that Google is
[07:12.240 --> 07:14.400]  a CIA NSA front.
[07:14.400 --> 07:19.960]  They now admit that violating your 4th and 5th amendment spying on everything.
[07:19.960 --> 07:23.440]  So we're going to be discussing that as well today.
[07:23.440 --> 07:28.760]  The cynical term don't be evil is a joke.
[07:28.760 --> 07:37.400]  Their slogan, their maxim of don't be evil is a stinking joke.
[07:37.400 --> 07:44.640]  I'm not going to really talk about machete anymore after today.
[07:44.640 --> 07:48.320]  The reason I've discussed it is I was contacted.
[07:48.320 --> 07:51.800]  It's the number two film at the box office right now.
[07:51.800 --> 07:57.160]  I was contacted three months ago by Hispanic members of Texas filmmaker Robert Rodriguez's
[07:57.160 --> 08:03.800]  crew who said they were afraid it would reflect badly on Hispanic Americans.
[08:03.800 --> 08:12.080]  I was then sent the script because I went on television and the radio and I said this
[08:12.080 --> 08:18.600]  Arizona trailer says we have a message to Arizona and then it shows Hispanic gunmen
[08:18.600 --> 08:24.960]  shooting Texas politicians at the Texas Capitol shot in front of the Texas Capitol with state
[08:24.960 --> 08:31.000]  of Texas funding.
[08:31.000 --> 08:35.680]  Then Rodriguez and others came out and said this is ridiculous none of that's in the
[08:35.680 --> 08:36.680]  movie.
[08:36.680 --> 08:43.200]  So then I got the actual script from one of our Hollywood sources and Rodriguez's ex-wife
[08:43.200 --> 08:49.120]  who's also the producer on the film she came out in the Austin America statesman UPI Reuters
[08:49.120 --> 08:54.280]  literally hundreds of publications in the last two weeks and said that Mr. Jones does
[08:54.280 --> 09:00.240]  not have the script and it's not true and he's just saying he has it and none of what
[09:00.240 --> 09:02.160]  he says is in the movie is in it.
[09:02.160 --> 09:08.400]  Well I took six of the crew Friday night to see it and it is the exact script.
[09:08.400 --> 09:11.560]  It was had the name of his agent on it.
[09:11.560 --> 09:19.200]  I got it from a Hollywood source who I know and it was confirmed also got it from other
[09:19.200 --> 09:23.960]  anonymous sources so I got it from multiple sources but I got it from a source I know
[09:23.960 --> 09:29.240]  in Hollywood and I went to the movie and it was word for word the script.
[09:29.240 --> 09:36.800]  So Robert Rodriguez and his ex-wife have played everybody for fools because they don't want
[09:36.800 --> 09:44.080]  the 18% of the budget that's what Texas is going to pay him.
[09:44.080 --> 09:49.400]  Rick Perry we have the video clip called it a few months ago the model of the Texas Film
[09:49.400 --> 09:53.920]  Commission program the governor Rick Perry.
[09:53.920 --> 09:57.920]  Now there's a state law that the films can't get these incentives if it quote puts Texas
[09:57.920 --> 09:58.920]  in a bad light.
[09:58.920 --> 10:03.960]  Let me see the movie opens and the script opens and the film is now out there anybody
[10:03.960 --> 10:05.880]  can go see it.
[10:05.880 --> 10:10.160]  I don't recommend you do it's one of the worst movies production wise I've ever seen.
[10:10.160 --> 10:14.760]  I know that's the style but I mean I felt dirty when I left.
[10:14.760 --> 10:26.680]  Like my brain had been hacked on with a machete and the film opens with Don Johnson playing
[10:26.680 --> 10:28.640]  the part of the Minutemen.
[10:28.640 --> 10:31.360]  Now the Minutemen have never killed anybody.
[10:31.360 --> 10:36.320]  The Minutemen have never killed any Hispanic children it's actually the Mexican coyotes
[10:36.320 --> 10:41.280]  what last week they killed 72 people many times including children mainly Central and
[10:41.280 --> 10:44.680]  South American immigrants that come in if they don't have extra money at the Texas border
[10:44.680 --> 10:46.240]  they're murdered.
[10:46.240 --> 10:52.680]  Their torture their heads are chopped off with machetes and Rodriguez knows that.
[10:52.680 --> 11:01.320]  This is a whole drug culture radical Mexican supremacist culture dealing with these machetes
[11:01.320 --> 11:07.560]  and so a week and a half ago 72 men women and children had their heads chopped off in
[11:07.560 --> 11:14.080]  Mexico 80 miles from the Texas border not by Minutemen but by the Mexican cartels that
[11:14.080 --> 11:17.680]  are in complete control of many of the regional governments.
[11:17.680 --> 11:22.360]  The news admitted it was Los Zetas quote former Mexican military it's kind of like former
[11:22.360 --> 11:25.800]  CIA no such animal.
[11:25.800 --> 11:32.880]  The movie opens with a group of about 25 illegals dumped out near the border Texans pull up
[11:32.880 --> 11:37.360]  in cowboy hats so if you wear a cowboy hat you're evil and the Mexicans get on their
[11:37.360 --> 11:45.040]  knees they blow the heads off of Mexican children one after the other while a state senator
[11:45.040 --> 11:52.240]  wearing the cowboy hat in the suit basically looks like Rick Perry makes a pregnant Mexican
[11:52.240 --> 11:57.680]  illegal get on her knees and she says I'm pregnant they go good we want to kill your
[11:57.680 --> 12:02.840]  little evil stinking and they use racial terms baby and they shoot her in the guts blowing
[12:02.840 --> 12:07.080]  the baby out onto the ground and then they go oh my gosh this is wonderful we've killed
[12:07.080 --> 12:09.200]  another one of their babies.
[12:09.200 --> 12:17.200]  Now in World War I the British ran propaganda ads in newspapers showing Germans bayonetting
[12:17.200 --> 12:22.080]  babies it wasn't true with a dead baby on the end of a bayonet.
[12:22.080 --> 12:28.760]  In history class just basic college history I was taught about this being the most base
[12:28.760 --> 12:35.960]  form of propaganda and the entire movie is Mexican children being murdered the entire
[12:35.960 --> 12:41.080]  movie is Catholic priests being crucified by white people screaming racist things this
[12:41.080 --> 12:46.720]  couldn't you you couldn't have a film that puts Texas in a worse light and anybody who
[12:46.720 --> 12:51.920]  doesn't want a wide open border with crime pouring across it with Mexico in full collapse
[12:51.920 --> 12:56.960]  with our country going bankrupt Bloomberg reporting 46 states on the verge of bankrupts
[12:56.960 --> 13:05.440]  here already bankrupt if you want any border control you want to murder pregnant women
[13:05.440 --> 13:12.620]  the worst thing you can do societally none of it's true and it shows the coyotes as good
[13:12.620 --> 13:17.760]  guys in the movie part of a secret network and let me tell you something my old office
[13:17.760 --> 13:22.160]  was down off of Mary Street and 1st Street where the real network is based in Austin
[13:22.160 --> 13:29.720]  with the coyotes with the law firms that helped the illegals Vicente Fox came to Texas five
[13:29.720 --> 13:34.640]  years ago and gave the state of Texas Austin police department and Wells Fargo an award
[13:34.640 --> 13:41.440]  for violating federal and state law and for not arresting illegals who don't have ideas
[13:41.440 --> 13:50.440]  illegals are above the law so there there is a network of this and it's the coyotes
[13:50.440 --> 13:55.520]  it's the money launders it's the banks that was also in Reuters in Bloomberg last week
[13:55.520 --> 14:03.400]  where major banks have pled guilty to actually financing the coyotes and the drug lords but
[14:03.400 --> 14:09.680]  in this movie there's a secret network that's basically going to overthrow Texas and quote
[14:09.680 --> 14:17.280]  resettle the Southwest so it's la reconquista reconquer and Fox News had a headline the
[14:17.280 --> 14:25.480]  la reconquista is on I searched the term machete last night and saw a Fox News piece about
[14:25.480 --> 14:30.800]  a TV piece they did called the lure the actually the la reconquista is here guys Google that
[14:30.800 --> 14:34.840]  for me under news I want to show it to folks who are watching our radio show simulcast
[14:34.840 --> 14:41.240]  at prisonplanet.tv but what Fox didn't tell you when the piece is news core is putting
[14:41.240 --> 14:48.000]  this movie out so of course Rick Perry is going to pay for 18% of the budget with taxpayer
[14:48.000 --> 15:00.320]  money now here's the deal I want to live in peace with everybody I want to get along with
[15:00.320 --> 15:07.840]  everyone I want to live in peace but the big mega corporations that control and run this
[15:07.840 --> 15:13.080]  nation they want to divide and conquer our country and we have the North American Union
[15:13.080 --> 15:18.800]  documents we have the SPP documents judicial watch sued three years ago and got them where
[15:18.800 --> 15:24.280]  they've had meetings in Canada in Banff and in Waco with the corporate leaders behind
[15:24.280 --> 15:29.880]  closed doors setting up the end of borders there's the Fox News article the la reconquista
[15:29.880 --> 15:37.680]  is here and they want to break down the borders drive down the wages and use the illegal alien
[15:37.680 --> 15:46.440]  voting block as a political weapon and both parties are involved so Robert Rodriguez
[15:46.440 --> 15:52.080]  is a liar we did have the real script the Arizona trailer is the film and more and they
[15:52.080 --> 15:57.320]  even call it helter skelter which means race war Charlie Manson quotes in the film this
[15:57.320 --> 16:04.880]  is pure evil Alex Jones here with urgent information concerning trends research dot com the trends

[20:25.520 --> 20:31.360]  w bush tried four times to legalize at least 30 million illegal aliens in this country they
[20:31.360 --> 20:39.240]  lied and said it was 14 million but all the major think tanks say between 25 and 35 million
[20:39.240 --> 20:44.600]  now obama has tried to pass the exact same legislation remember the last time bush did
[20:44.600 --> 20:50.440]  it in 2008 the republicans for the democrats they said we're not going to let the legislation
[20:50.440 --> 20:56.960]  be public but we promise you it's not amnesty then senator sessions a good senator said
[20:56.960 --> 21:01.240]  i don't care if i get sanctioned by the senate he played chicken with them they didn't sanction
[21:01.240 --> 21:05.240]  him but he broke their orders they shouldn't be able to order an elected representative
[21:05.240 --> 21:11.560]  around he has free speech he released the bill and it was worse than amnesty it said
[21:11.560 --> 21:18.960]  aggravated felons could sign a pledge and be given citizenship we have a key article
[21:18.960 --> 21:24.560]  up at info wars dot com titled billam won the gates foundation gave millions to la raza
[21:24.560 --> 21:30.880]  what does raza mean it means the race what is their public slogan for those inside the
[21:30.880 --> 21:39.040]  race everything for those outside the race nothing billions of dollars over two billion
[21:39.040 --> 21:44.320]  dollars in the last decade it's billions before that given by the ford foundation has more
[21:44.320 --> 21:49.880]  than 40 billion total to matcha and la raza and others to teach hispanic children in
[21:49.880 --> 21:55.640]  mexico in latin america where this movie's now airing with bloody posters of a machete
[21:55.640 --> 22:01.360]  that says everybody for machete to hate the united states the republicans and the democrats
[22:01.360 --> 22:06.080]  the big foundations why do they want this they want to bring in a group of people who are
[22:06.080 --> 22:12.120]  hardworking and good but fill them full of racial hatred and turn them into a political
[22:12.120 --> 22:17.200]  arm and then republicans stand back and go oh my gosh it's the democrats that are running
[22:17.200 --> 22:23.320]  mecha and la raza oh my gosh it's the democrats that want carbon taxes oh really coming up
[22:23.320 --> 22:30.880]  i'm gonna play a news core internal video release that was shown to all news core employees
[22:30.880 --> 22:36.080]  this is an internal news core promotional that they then later themselves put out publicly
[22:36.080 --> 22:42.840]  where the ceo of fox entertainment brags and shows all the pro man made global warming
[22:42.840 --> 22:53.840]  stuff they're pushing and who's funding machete we go pull it up on imdb news core fox see
[22:53.840 --> 22:59.280]  master corporations control both ends of the political spectrum and that way no matter
[22:59.280 --> 23:05.360]  where you run they control you you think they want caucasians and hispanics who by the way
[23:05.360 --> 23:09.440]  are european do you think they want us getting along do you think they want hispanics coming
[23:09.440 --> 23:15.000]  here and becoming pro george washington pro second amendment pro free market no they force
[23:15.000 --> 23:21.040]  feed them in the colleges and the public schools la reconquista and then the state of texas
[23:21.040 --> 23:28.320]  funds up to eighteen percent of the funding of this movie machete with your taxpayer money
[23:28.320 --> 23:36.320]  when it shows texas politicians is murdering drug dealing criminals
[23:36.320 --> 23:40.240]  murdering pregnant hispanic women i i i mean this is incredible when the state of texas
[23:40.240 --> 23:46.040]  denies funding the films like waco because they said it put texas in a bad light last
[23:46.040 --> 23:50.960]  year they denied and said don't make your film in our state you won't get tax incentives
[23:50.960 --> 23:57.600]  so they went to louisiana and rick perry's office three months ago we called them actually
[23:57.600 --> 24:02.560]  they contacted us his press secretary contacted us and said mr jones we're not funding that
[24:02.560 --> 24:06.240]  film we'd already called their office and they said yes we are funding it then we found
[24:06.240 --> 24:11.840]  the video clip of rick perry saying robert rodriguez and his film machete is the model
[24:11.840 --> 24:20.880]  of the texas film commission he is the model see rick perry's all hat no cattle and i'm
[24:20.880 --> 24:26.320]  not saying vote for white folks he's just as bad or worse the point is let me read to
[24:26.320 --> 24:32.960]  you from glenn beck's new book glenn beck the overton window 15 years ago on air i read
[24:32.960 --> 24:39.040]  this quote i read this quote every month on air for my 15 years on air it's an 900 page
[24:39.040 --> 24:43.840]  book called tragedy and hope he was allowed into the cia state department archives in
[24:43.840 --> 24:51.280]  1962 to 1967 he published the book a year later tragedy and hope and glenn beck quotes it
[24:51.280 --> 24:59.040]  right here in his faction book he calls it fiction that's fact this is carol quigley
[24:59.040 --> 25:04.080]  bill clinton's mentor the argument that the two parties should represent opposed ideas
[25:04.720 --> 25:10.640]  and policies is a foolish idea instead the two parties should be almost identical so the
[25:10.640 --> 25:14.960]  american people can throw the rascals out at any election without leading to any profound
[25:15.920 --> 25:20.240]  or extensive shifts in policy then it should be possible to replace it every four years of
[25:20.240 --> 25:28.080]  necessary by the other party which will be none other of the things but still pursue again then
[25:28.080 --> 25:31.920]  it should be possible to replace it every four years of necessary by the other party which
[25:31.920 --> 25:37.920]  will be none of these things but will still pursue with new vigor approximately the same
[25:37.920 --> 25:47.040]  basic policies tragedy and hope 1968 this was commissioned 1000 copies were commissioned
[25:47.040 --> 25:56.480]  by the cia about themselves to give to their highest level operatives to be able to understand
[25:56.480 --> 26:02.240]  the takedown of america because the cia openly works for offshore banks the ones that have
[26:02.240 --> 26:10.720]  stolen 28 trillion dollars in bailout money again bloomberg ap not 887 billion and what is
[26:10.720 --> 26:19.680]  this book this book literally shook me to my core the overton window it back in this book
[26:19.680 --> 26:26.080]  admits the government stages terror attacks wants to set off nukes for marshal law and he
[26:26.800 --> 26:31.680]  the character that represents him is this evil operative who poses as a patriot
[26:33.200 --> 26:37.840]  and then when he finally becomes a real patriot they grab him the cia grabs him
[26:37.840 --> 26:42.720]  and gives him electroshock therapy and then put him back out on television to control
[26:42.720 --> 26:48.960]  conservatives and patriots i mean they just throw it in your face in a faction book meanwhile
[26:48.960 --> 26:52.960]  beck says you're the scum of the earth if you question the gulf of tonkin which they admit
[26:52.960 --> 26:57.040]  was staged to get us into vietnam you're the scum of the earth if you question seven seven
[26:57.040 --> 27:02.480]  and you're dangerous and you may be violent if you point out the government ran drills at the
[27:02.480 --> 27:09.040]  exact same time at the exact same places of the bombings we had an actuary done it was what was
[27:09.040 --> 27:17.120]  it one chance out of 23 trek to gillian that's tens of trillions of times more than all the sand
[27:17.120 --> 27:21.920]  and all the world impossible why do they run drills because if one government group gets caught
[27:21.920 --> 27:26.800]  planting the bombs they tell the other government group that's good the white side oh we were just
[27:26.800 --> 27:32.080]  part of the drill they ran drills a bomb in the world trade center in 93 new york times admitted
[27:32.080 --> 27:37.840]  the fbi cooked the bomb train the drivers let it go forward that's in this book but it's nukes bombing
[27:37.840 --> 27:46.240]  la and then he gives newspaper articles about government stage terror in the end while on the
[27:46.240 --> 27:53.280]  air he says you're a piece of unamerican garbage if you talk about it i mean you talk about mind
[27:53.280 --> 28:00.160]  control ladies and gentlemen i don't even know what to think of this you think i'm happy to get
[28:00.160 --> 28:09.120]  up on the air and talk about government sponsored terror 10 years ago i was offered glenn beck's
[28:09.120 --> 28:14.640]  job before glenn beck existed he's only been a patriot radio host for eight years i was told

[33:30.320 --> 33:37.120]  two on two separate occasions and on several other lesser occasions smaller networks
[33:37.840 --> 33:42.480]  i was approached and i was told yes there's a global government forming but it's for the
[33:42.480 --> 33:46.800]  good of the planet to redistribute wealth and i pointed out no it's not that's what low level
[33:46.800 --> 33:53.200]  people are told uh we want you to have the biggest national show in the country again i
[33:53.200 --> 33:58.560]  was approached by the number one and number two consecutive largest syndicators at the time
[33:58.560 --> 34:03.840]  and they said look you come out of the radio you grab people you have an intellect you've
[34:03.840 --> 34:11.760]  studied history uh well you know we've done focus groups on you you will be the next rush limbaugh

[34:27.440 --> 34:32.080]  conservative libertarian host a little more cutting edge in rush limbaugh but there will
[34:32.080 --> 34:40.800]  be editorial control you will cover what we say and i said no thank you and at the time it was
[34:43.280 --> 34:48.800]  10 15 times what i was making money wise the next offer was probably 30 times i don't remember
[34:48.800 --> 34:55.120]  all the exact ratios the point is it was a lot of money a lot of power the book deals everything
[34:55.120 --> 35:00.000]  and of course they probably had 15 20 people they were looking at developing
[35:01.040 --> 35:05.040]  you know they tell all those beautiful young women out west or in connecticut or wherever
[35:05.040 --> 35:09.760]  come out to california you'll be a movie star and five years later they're a crack addicted
[35:09.760 --> 35:15.840]  you know porn star so they had a lot of people they were out there farming and looking for
[35:15.840 --> 35:23.040]  to be glenn beck somebody they could control so you got news core i'm going to play this clip
[35:23.040 --> 35:28.800]  coming up admitting that they promote the global warming fraud they've got o'reilly doing it
[35:28.800 --> 35:33.200]  they've got the big globalist newt genrich promoting global warming taxes they've got pat
[35:33.200 --> 35:40.800]  robertson out promoting it now that it's imploded thanks to the information being leaked internally
[35:40.800 --> 35:46.400]  how it was a fraud and this show and others and ron paul and the climate depot and many others
[35:46.400 --> 35:52.720]  it's a lot of trouble now and al gore's been discredited but just a year ago you saw a
[35:52.720 --> 35:58.240]  neo-conservative push along with barack h obama to give you the global tax
[36:02.800 --> 36:06.800]  and only a few of the fox host were even allowed to talk about it but most of them
[36:06.800 --> 36:13.600]  were pushing it like it was real but what did glenn beck write just a week and a half ago glenn
[36:13.600 --> 36:19.360]  beck key obama ally works with socialists for global tax well why doesn't and this is from
[36:19.360 --> 36:25.120]  glenn beck dot com why doesn't glenn talk about robert murdoch why doesn't glenn discuss that
[36:25.120 --> 36:35.680]  no see what they're doing is when the democrats were out of power when the democrats weren't in
[36:35.680 --> 36:41.200]  office keith oberman and others played the part of anti-patriot act anti-police state
[36:41.200 --> 36:46.240]  anti-surveillance now they're in power they're all for it now republicans are out of power
[36:46.240 --> 36:50.560]  oh they're against the tyranny they're against the corruption they're against all the problems
[36:50.560 --> 36:56.080]  oh when law enforcement last year sent this radio show we broke it the mic report and homeland
[36:56.080 --> 37:02.160]  security reports the media picked up on it and said obama had issued that well yes obama had
[37:02.160 --> 37:08.480]  reissued it turned out a year before george w bush had issued those reports saying that
[37:08.480 --> 37:14.880]  homeland security was really for conservatives gun owners libertarians and we've gotten similar
[37:14.880 --> 37:20.080]  reports during those years but it never made national news because oh no the neocon tv and
[37:20.080 --> 37:26.080]  radio they didn't want to talk about bush and the people that controlled him setting up homeland
[37:26.080 --> 37:30.640]  security for the american people remember it was the republicans that were for the banker
[37:30.640 --> 37:38.960]  bailouts along with the democrats it was bill clinton with the help of republican votes in 1990s
[37:38.960 --> 37:47.680]  who got rid of the glass steel act in 1999 and it was the same bush advisors that went into the
[37:47.680 --> 37:55.440]  obama administration so all that's happening is the republicans are playing the part of the
[37:55.440 --> 38:02.160]  anti-establishment right now and i do agree with republicans views and their state platforms like
[38:02.160 --> 38:09.920]  the state of texas and i tend to side with them more the grassroots are great people but the leadership
[38:10.640 --> 38:17.680]  is in bed with the very same people and that's the issue that you have to understand i mean how
[38:17.680 --> 38:25.840]  can glenbeck write a book he calls faction fiction that's fact say this book is real at the at the
[38:25.840 --> 38:31.520]  beginning and at the end have a 30-something page glossary give me a document cam shot for prison
[38:31.520 --> 38:39.760]  planet dot tv viewers he has a big link fee thing of news articles and quotes by edward bernese carol
[38:39.760 --> 38:46.160]  quigley he's got all the articles about drills on 7 7 with the london bombings at the exact same
[38:46.160 --> 38:52.720]  time exact same place eugenics how they want to sterilize you one child policies it's all there
[38:55.840 --> 39:00.880]  it's all there but it's a fiction book and then i've got clips of him saying
[39:00.880 --> 39:06.960]  there's no one i hate more than 9 11 victims families they're a bunch of scum because a bunch
[39:06.960 --> 39:12.480]  of them think we've been lied to about 9 11 well we know the commission said the official stories
[39:12.480 --> 39:18.880]  lie beck talks about how it's private global corporations that have infiltrated the cia and
[39:18.880 --> 39:24.320]  fbi that staged the terror and that most of the agents don't know that's true too i'm not even
[39:24.320 --> 39:30.560]  really saying our government stage these attacks or allow these attacks to take place the point is
[39:30.560 --> 39:36.320]  that we have newscasts with them saying getting back we're going to blow up building 7 that 47
[39:36.320 --> 39:42.400]  story building and i'm supposed to just see that and not talk about it or cia drills of the world
[39:42.400 --> 39:48.320]  trade centers and the pentagon being attacked by airplanes that morning and the norad tapes and the
[39:48.320 --> 39:55.280]  faa tapes where they're saying why are all these blips being put on my screens why are their drills
[39:55.280 --> 39:59.920]  of the same thing happening while it's happening so that the pentagon got confused and stood down
[40:01.040 --> 40:07.840]  just like 77 just like 1993 bill clinton bombing the world trade world trade centers bill clinton's
[40:07.840 --> 40:14.640]  controllers bill clinton i mean it's it's in the new york times in cbs news it came out in federal
[40:14.640 --> 40:20.240]  court that the fbi hired a mod salon had him build a real bomb and then he said now run the sting
[40:20.240 --> 40:23.920]  and bust them they're gonna do it in three days the bombs built and they said no we're letting it go
[40:23.920 --> 40:29.760]  forward and a mod salon who worked for the cia knew they were setting him up and recorded more
[40:29.760 --> 40:36.160]  than 10 hours of it because they were going to set him up he gave a press conference with the tape
[40:37.440 --> 40:42.320]  the tapes now been released by the federal government it's in the latest film we produced
[40:42.320 --> 40:50.720]  invisible empire the clips of him with the fbi and glenn beck writes a book about it and says it's
[40:50.720 --> 40:59.440]  all real but then i'm bad because i'm talking about it now why is this being done do you
[40:59.440 --> 41:06.800]  remember 10 15 20 years ago national talk show host would say the cfr the council and farm relations
[41:06.800 --> 41:13.520]  doesn't even exist it was totally secret then now it's public oliver tv it once opened borders

[41:18.480 --> 41:25.840]  major legislation that deals with the takeover and it's a coop detector you're a nut you're a
[41:25.840 --> 41:30.480]  lunatic of you've read carol quickley's book you're a lunatic of you've read cia declassified
[41:30.480 --> 41:35.920]  documents you're a lunatic of you've read the declassified rex 84 fema camp plans which beck
[41:35.920 --> 41:42.400]  admits in this book he said they don't exist and then he in the book he admits it and then has
[41:42.400 --> 41:47.440]  i mean this is insane why are they doing this because they've caved in and this is the best news
[41:47.440 --> 41:53.840]  i could bring you for decades they tried to pacify libertarians conservatives researchers
[41:53.840 --> 41:57.760]  americans that were smart enough to not be controlled by the mind control the disinformation

[42:03.600 --> 42:07.680]  and they had to admit they're setting up a bank of the world carbon taxes to finance it

[47:47.920 --> 47:56.960]  is atrocities the answer to 1984 is 1776
[47:56.960 --> 48:11.360]  okay i want to give the phone number out and take calls and cover other important news on the next

[48:19.840 --> 48:26.240]  live september 5th sunday edition now before i go any further i want to finish up with what i was
[48:26.240 --> 48:34.320]  talking about with machete and fox news core funding this race war uh division film at the
[48:34.320 --> 48:39.920]  same time fox is criticizing it basically to hype it and to promote it uh it's incredible
[48:40.640 --> 48:46.480]  and they need to tell their viewers that they're doing this but separately you've got news core
[48:46.480 --> 48:53.280]  one of the biggest pushers in their movies their tv shows their radio shows of global carbon taxes
[48:53.280 --> 49:00.480]  bill o'reilly all of these people pushing it but at the same time they then control the movement
[49:00.480 --> 49:06.480]  against it that way they can defeat it at key junctures and notice glenn beck supported the
[49:06.480 --> 49:12.800]  banker bailout bill glenn beck of course over and over again has supported the patriot act now
[49:12.800 --> 49:18.720]  being used against citizens and non-terror related cases he now controls a value-added tax something
[49:18.720 --> 49:23.360]  the globalist want something they've got introduced right now but they're going to keep that along with
[49:23.360 --> 49:30.880]  the income tax and so my issue is they get your confidence and then they basically sell you down
[49:30.880 --> 49:37.600]  the river just like obama did on the controlled left and beck understands this he put carol quigley
[49:37.600 --> 49:42.880]  in his book his new book the overton window the argument that the two political parties
[49:43.440 --> 49:48.320]  should represent opposing ideas and policies as a foolish idea instead the two parties should
[49:48.320 --> 49:52.880]  be almost identical so that the american people can throw the rascals out at any election without
[49:52.880 --> 49:58.080]  leading to any profound or extensive shifts in policy then it should be possible to replace it
[49:58.080 --> 50:04.560]  every four years of necessary by the other party which will be none of the things you know getting
[50:04.560 --> 50:10.000]  rid of the tyranny but will still pursue with the new vigor approximately the very same basic
[50:10.000 --> 50:17.600]  policies so beck is telling you that he's an insider he goes on the popular will cannot be taken
[50:17.600 --> 50:26.000]  for granted it must be created it must be manufactured a year and a half ago republicans
[50:26.000 --> 50:31.680]  were being booed at public events along with the democrats so they made rebellion only about the
[50:31.680 --> 50:37.040]  tea party then had the republicans come in with a tea party express and dick army and finance the
[50:37.040 --> 50:43.360]  whole thing and take that over the same rhetoric a lot a lot of truth is being told but as soon as
[50:43.360 --> 50:48.960]  they get in power they're going to sabotage it just like mr global warming tax newt genrich
[50:48.960 --> 50:55.680]  who wants that globalist tax just like he took over the 1994 revolution there are a lot of good
[50:55.680 --> 51:02.320]  candidates running as republicans all over this country and when they are good like rand paul you
[51:02.320 --> 51:07.600]  see the republican establishment and dick shaney come after rand paul when he was running against
[51:07.600 --> 51:14.000]  the establishment republican in the primaries so i'm telling you folks we're in a fight for the heart
[51:14.000 --> 51:20.080]  and soul of this country and we've got a hold rush limbaugh and glenn beck and others feet to the
[51:20.080 --> 51:25.040]  fire and say look alex jones and rand paul and others were right there is a global government
[51:25.040 --> 51:30.720]  it is run by banks there are carbon taxes all of this is being set up they denied that for all
[51:30.720 --> 51:36.560]  those years and now that they couldn't suppress you learning the truth because of my work and many
[51:36.560 --> 51:41.680]  others work and my listeners work now they're coming out going okay some of it's real i mean
[51:41.680 --> 51:45.840]  there's quotes in here about the billard burg group world government everything but then on
[51:45.840 --> 51:53.600]  their shows they make fun of it but they're being forced to tell the truth more and more
[51:53.600 --> 51:59.280]  we are winning ladies and gentlemen but remember that when the republicans get back in power don't
[51:59.280 --> 52:04.640]  be so in love with them and hating the democrats so much that you don't hold their feet to the fire
[52:04.640 --> 52:09.600]  there don't be so in love with their propaganda just like bill clinton supporters wouldn't wake
[52:09.600 --> 52:13.600]  up when i try to wake you know talk to him and talk sense into him about him being a liar
[52:13.600 --> 52:20.560]  and corrupt because they had invested in him as being their daddy their friend their master
[52:20.560 --> 52:27.680]  their helper and now you've invested in george w bush and you find out he's just a puppet so
[52:27.680 --> 52:32.400]  then people invest in obama and they won't wake up when he's conning them and pimping them
[52:32.400 --> 52:38.720]  now i got a lot of evidence on this front but if you want to find the video of this just search
[52:38.720 --> 52:44.480]  the term fox admits to planting political brainwashing and popular tv shows this is news
[52:44.480 --> 52:50.800]  core showing clips of tv and movies where they promote global warming and global taxes to the
[52:50.800 --> 52:55.680]  population but then separately they've got fox news where they're fighting it it's all part of
[52:55.680 --> 53:02.080]  their business model to control the opposition okay now let's go ahead and play the short clip
[53:02.080 --> 53:07.760]  here is news core with with one of their executives telling you that they're promoting global carbon
[53:07.760 --> 53:12.640]  taxes here it is
[53:17.040 --> 53:23.360]  i want to set an example to others in our industry and other industries that uh no matter what the
[53:23.360 --> 53:29.760]  size of your carbon footprint is you can make a difference i'll stay for one record global warming
[53:29.760 --> 53:34.880]  probably press button to see what global warming will do in the next three years
[53:36.880 --> 53:43.840]  three years is a long ways away what could we do on a practical level to start making a difference
[53:44.560 --> 53:50.560]  just had another thought what if the scared straight show had a green message to the biggest
[53:50.560 --> 53:58.240]  thing we've done is inserting messages about the environment into uh some of our content
[53:58.240 --> 54:04.560]  i don't follow green it means environmentally friendly the lifeblood of our company is a quality
[54:04.560 --> 54:11.440]  of our tv shows and we would accomplish nothing if we compromise that quality going green doesn't fit
[54:11.440 --> 54:16.800]  with the rest of the show the working magic make it clear hey brian i'm not gonna recycle this aluminum
[54:16.800 --> 54:26.000]  can i'm just gonna throw it in the trash your earth's bitch the most powerful way that we could
[54:26.000 --> 54:32.880]  communicate the commitment on behalf of our company was to change the practices within the
[54:32.880 --> 54:39.760]  production as well as work in a message about global warming about environmental changes and
[54:39.760 --> 54:46.720]  about empowering people to take responsibility whatever your wedding programs bumping uh
[54:48.000 --> 54:54.960]  seats we're having a green wedding so after the reception our guests can plant the programs
[54:54.960 --> 55:00.720]  real loud i could live in the sea i make friends with the whale we live in a sunken pirate ship
[55:01.280 --> 55:05.520]  that is your global warming we've come up with you know all sorts of strategies for
[55:06.080 --> 55:13.360]  lessening our footprint everything from utilizing hybrid vehicles in in on our production look at all
[55:13.360 --> 55:19.360]  these hummers what kind of jerk would drive one of those dude this car kicks ass
[55:19.360 --> 55:30.400]  we're using biodiesel fuel and our generators instead of regular diesel no car no electricity
[55:30.400 --> 55:37.840]  coffee all right stop i can't watch anymore stop it she goes on and on it's up on info wars.com
[55:38.400 --> 55:42.480]  and and there's another level of lies they show reasonable things like recycling
[55:43.040 --> 55:48.240]  but then tied to the green agenda the green agenda is global taxes to the private banks
[55:48.240 --> 55:54.880]  now openly announced it's having home inspections it's not having state control it's not having
[55:54.880 --> 56:03.280]  local control so so here's my issue there's fox tv making fun of george bush with their executives
[56:03.280 --> 56:08.880]  so they own both sides of the market the liberal and the conservative but they always move the
[56:08.880 --> 56:16.000]  agenda of more collectivism and control and quote progressivism forward and at key points
[56:16.000 --> 56:21.440]  glenbeck's for vat taxes he's for i've even seen him before the carbon taxes now lately
[56:21.440 --> 56:25.840]  he's been against it now that he knows he wasn't able to sucker people bill o'reilly the same thing
[56:26.800 --> 56:31.280]  saying ron paul supporters might be terrorist remember that three years ago during the primaries
[56:31.840 --> 56:35.280]  that the money bomb might mean they were going to blow something up and nothing to do with that
[56:35.280 --> 56:38.560]  saying we need to use the army against these people there's no fema camps
[56:38.560 --> 56:48.320]  the banker bailouts good all of this is being done oh yeah he'll expose acorn and other little
[56:48.320 --> 56:52.880]  slimy groups and that's good but at the end of the day here's another one he had a documentary
[56:52.880 --> 56:56.480]  last week about mal being the greatest mass murder in history i've made a film about that
[56:57.040 --> 57:03.680]  but he didn't tell you it's declassified the cia and 49 admits they put malwin our government
[57:03.680 --> 57:11.920]  sent the bolsheviks over in 1917 to overthrow the russian government the banks that run america
[57:11.920 --> 57:19.200]  run the communism because big mega corporations use communism as a way to destroy the middle class
[57:19.200 --> 57:24.480]  steal their wealth and give it to them as the founder of the rockefeller dynasty said competition
[57:24.480 --> 57:30.720]  is a sin they found it the modern environmental movement their funding mecha and la raza the
[57:30.720 --> 57:39.680]  state of texas is funding machete the race war anti anglo movie do you understand they are running
[57:39.680 --> 57:46.080]  both sides of it to divide and conquer and bring down this republic obama works for the same people
[57:46.080 --> 57:55.520]  as beck you've heard alex explain how the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with
[57:55.520 --> 58:00.240]  yourself produced colloidal silver solutions yet many are unaware of the entire function of the
[58:00.240 --> 58:04.880]  silver lung system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or

[01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:54.720]  if the most significant events in in the last 60 years jfk and 911 if something can be proven a lie
[01:08:54.720 --> 01:09:03.040]  then look at the whole picture they can take you president from you they can pull down the
[01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:09.600]  building no i agree with you in fact that's what glenn beck's book is uh it's a multifaceted thing
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:14.480]  for people in the know it's a threat my father read it and i wanted to get his views we had a
[01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:18.640]  meeting this morning and i said dad what's your view on this book before i tell people my view
[01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:23.920]  he said exactly he said this is a threat this is glenn beck saying i'm the bad guy in this book
[01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:30.080]  i'm the guy posing as a patriot you can't beat us we're gonna take over we can do anything we want
[01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:36.560]  to you and but but for his brain dead fans it's like that's a great fiction book when he's telling
[01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:42.240]  you this isn't fiction he tells you in the book this is real the names have just been changed
[01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:50.480]  go ahead ask us uh you have you have a strong following you can move search terms you can
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:56.080]  and direct information flow you are at the you know the center of quite a bit of this with
[01:09:56.080 --> 01:10:00.640]  the research and the research is the key for your listeners if you want to know you can find out
[01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:07.040]  it's all there well i mean listen listen this week we've posted in the in the last seven days
[01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:12.400]  four different rockerfeller foundation documents from their own website admitting they develop
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:19.600]  vaccines uh things mixed with vaccines to sterilize the population but only selectively
[01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:22.640]  i mean it's all admitted mark i appreciate your call and i hear what you're saying
[01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:26.720]  by the way i'd forgotten to give you the new search term if you choose to make it number one
[01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:30.960]  we're 20 for 20 we've never failed and it's having a big effect because then hundreds of
[01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:36.320]  newspapers and publications then link through to our articles and write about it it's a key
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:41.760]  weapon in the info war so i'm using it we're going to put out the term machete race war
[01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:52.720]  machete race war machete m-a-c-h-e-t-e machete m-a-c-h-e-t-e machete race war so that folks
[01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:57.840]  will go actually hear what this film is really about in fact give me a document cam shot this is
[01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:04.560]  a world war one propaganda showing a german soldier bayonetting a baby and that's basically
[01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:14.400]  what the film machete is so the search term is machete race war or the spanish inflection
[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:22.160]  machete race war thank you mark mark in texas you're on the air hey great day to you welcome speak

[01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:12.720]  getting out there i talked to people about glenn beck uh a year ago or more i guess when he was
[01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:18.800]  doing the uh debunking the fema camps and they were telling me i was crazy and now people are
[01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:24.320]  coming around around here and i live in a pretty strong Mormon you know Mormon they've got them
[01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:29.520]  they've got the emergency centers act admitting the camps they built i sent glenn beck two months
[01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:35.440]  before he did his show binders we we had our listeners emailing the civilian inmate labor camp
[01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:41.840]  program rex 84 and he admits it's all real in his book but won't go on the radio or tv and tell folks
[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:48.560]  that he was wrong that there are fema camps right and people i talk to they say i see a lot of
[01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:54.720]  flip-flopping from this guy they tell me and uh also uh joel scousen that was an amazing interview
[01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:59.840]  he had with him and i use him to get into the Mormon population because he's a member as well
[01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:07.280]  so i just want to thank you for that and can i throw out a t-shirt idea sure uh watch out for
[01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:16.400]  stage terror like the street sign watch out for falling rocks shan awesome good to hear from
[01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:22.160]  me i appreciate your call uh let's go ahead and talk to dina in arizona dina you're on the air
[01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:28.480]  hi alex i appreciate you and i had a bit of information i found was interesting
[01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:32.480]  that i wanted to bring up to you i had met a gentleman a few years ago who said he was doing
[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:37.520]  construction work in the pentagon while the uh tax happened and he said the section that got hit
[01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:42.480]  with the plane or whatever hit it was completely empty there were no documents no people and
[01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:46.720]  coincidentally they don't know i interviewed a woman who was admittedly one of the victims in it
[01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:56.000]  and uh again it's just a it's all a complete lie but go ahead ma'am oh but he was just saying
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:01.920]  that they had sprayed some type of microfiber on that part of the pentagon and also um when i was
[01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:07.280]  traveling through mexico i noticed that all of the pyramids that i visited there was a strange uh
[01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:13.280]  like mecanic or you know that i symbol at every pyramid and they were doing excavations so i know
[01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:17.360]  that they're looking for something and just trying to take in all this information it seems like it
[01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:23.440]  all goes together well it certainly does dina and i appreciate your call uh i mean there's no doubt
[01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:29.680]  that the ashtex were into hardcore occult what we'd call satanism chopping children's hearts out
[01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:33.840]  but but we're told be politically correct don't criticize a culture well i'm against the nazi

[01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:12.560]  your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:17.440]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name
[01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:22.720]  of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:28.000]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:33.120]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families
[01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:37.680]  lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides

[01:19:54.080 --> 01:20:05.680]  solar backup dot com or call 1-877-327-0365 coast to coast direct from austin you're listening
[01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:18.400]  to the alex jones broadcasting network network live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide
[01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:30.080]  it's alex jones ladies and gentlemen i have decided to basically make the glenbeck deception
[01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:33.200]  but i'm not gonna probably call it the glenbeck deception i'm not sure yet
[01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:38.480]  just like i made the obama deception when he had an 85 percent approval rating
[01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:43.040]  and it was out a month and a half after he was in office i knew he would go back on every promise
[01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:47.680]  he'd made and i exposed how both parties are controlled by the very same people and that's
[01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:53.120]  what i'm going to do here but it's not just going to be about glenbeck the entire republican
[01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:59.520]  establishment so that you can say i'm wrong when it comes out and then later once they're in office
[01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:04.960]  you'll say man he's right again and that's why our stock goes up and up and up and fewer and fewer
[01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:09.120]  people doubt us because they understand we know what we're talking about but i'm not even saying
[01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:15.280]  glenbeck's a bad guy i've talked to two people high level at fox news one arms a household name
[01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:20.240]  who say glenbeck is scared to death and knows this is all real now and has bodyguards and didn't
[01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:27.040]  know what he got into and that he is actually a good guy and is woken up but that he doesn't
[01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:33.200]  like alex jones and did wake up from listening to this show and has five people that listen every
[01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:38.800]  day and he rips off everything we do and in his book he's got this patriot character who gets
[01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:43.120]  leaked the myack and homeland security reports demonizing conservatives but doesn't say it's
[01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:50.800]  alex jones so i mean every time i tune in it's like he calls public schools reeducation camps
[01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:58.720]  that my term it just feels weird because i love ron paul and his success i love judge enter depolitano
[01:21:58.720 --> 01:22:03.840]  on fox number one show on fox business only a few months in guaranteed to get higher ratings than
[01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:09.520]  beck he's never been a double talker never flip flop was against the banker bailout is a real
[01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:16.560]  constitutionalist was against the patriot act under bush beck was for it it's just that beck
[01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:25.120]  is being set up as a major icon to be the symbol of the patriot movement and so he can stab us in
[01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:31.120]  the back i mean i just showed you last hour news core that owns fox promoting global warming with
[01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:38.720]  messages in tv and they've got most of their news core people on fox news pushing it so my point is
[01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:44.240]  rupert murdoch is a globalist pushing world government and world taxes and we need to hold beck
[01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:48.720]  and others feed to the fire they know america's waking up they know the world's waking up so
[01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:53.280]  they're creating counterfeits to take control of it but the fact that they're having to do this
[01:22:53.280 --> 01:23:00.000]  shows you how far we've come so pray for glenn beck pray for barack obama it's just watching his show
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:05.440]  it's getting so slick and his whole new book is about mind control and semantical manipulation
[01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:10.240]  and how to control people and how the left and right's controlled i mean he knows what he's doing
[01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:15.600]  and of course he didn't really write this book it's ghost written this is high tech information
[01:23:16.640 --> 01:23:22.160]  and the system is trying to take over our movement the tea party and everything else okay
[01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:26.080]  i'm gonna shut up now i want to get to your calls then some news shannon to mississippi finish your
[01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:32.480]  point well anyway talking about glenn beck how he's got the mind control and he
[01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:37.680]  mutilates everybody and he's slick on tv which he is this is something i try to do inside of
[01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:43.760]  wake people up and if these american people don't wake up we're gonna be done we're gonna be through
[01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:50.000]  but i try to tell people about 9 11 and these cell phone calls that they made from those airplanes
[01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:56.240]  now everybody think about it this was the year 2001 now now it's a year 2000 these were non-air
[01:23:56.240 --> 01:24:02.240]  phones dozens of phone calls made from 30 000 feet or above impossible and now the fbi
[01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:06.960]  with the solicitor general's wife two years ago admitted those phone calls were never made
[01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:15.120]  that wasn't true there was no let's roll none of it it was all lies was all alive in fact
[01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:20.880]  dallas in the year 2006 now i called boring airlines and i talked to some individuals
[01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:26.720]  there some personnel there and they stated that they had put new cell phone antennas or new cell
[01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:33.840]  phone towers in the tail sections of every cargo airbus in the year 2006 now what did i do i have
[01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:39.600]  to do if they weren't so good in the year 2001 why are you doing it now in the year 2006 and they
[01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:48.720]  all stuttered they couldn't well i mean it's not your opinion the fbi admits that those phone calls
[01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:56.480]  were not made it's not true it's admitted and they just hide it in the washington post like they
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:02.160]  but not just in the washington post on that issue remember two months ago the washington post spy
[01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:08.080]  talked the weekly column they had the cia officers bragging how they created fake bin laden videos
[01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:15.840]  for us television i mean they think we're so dumb they go on fox and see it in i've played the clips
[01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:22.560]  here and say yes our troops grow the opium and help ship it out but it's good and then we arrest
[01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:28.720]  you if you're caught with it or limbaugh gets in trouble if he's got the hillbilly pills the oxy
[01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:33.360]  cotton the hillbilly heroin they think you're so dumb they just come around and go yeah we're
[01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:39.920]  growing the opium yeah we make fake bin laden videos i appreciate your call i mean it's amazing
[01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:47.520]  ak-47 in new jersey you're on the air yeah how you doing jones uh long-time listener first time
[01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:54.080]  caller i have a comment and a question uh first my comment is just to get the info war out there
[01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:58.880]  and wake people up i'm a private business owner small business owner and at the end of every job i
[01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:03.520]  clean carpets at the end of every job i hand them out uh one of your dvds and i could call them back
[01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:08.400]  months down the road and and uh it's like killing two birds with one stone i asked them hey how's
[01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:13.040]  your carpets doing and by the way what you think of that dvd and i had 10 times out of 10 wow you
[01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:17.760]  know you it really woke me up to things i didn't know so for anybody who's got a business if you're
[01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:22.400]  a waiter if you're a plumber if you're electrician you know you build up that customer relationship
[01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:26.240]  with that client at the end of your job you do good work you have to like you said it's free
[01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:31.200]  knowledge you know give it to him say watch it and uh and then you can call back and and talk about
[01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:35.040]  your work and also the dvd uh the dvd it's a good way to get your foot in the door to generate more
[01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:39.600]  business second my question is for you me and a couple of my friends were having a few drinks last
[01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:45.680]  night and we got to thinking you have a lot of listeners and uh what about uh a citizen's arrest
[01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:50.960]  i mean if everybody got together inside a citizen's arrest for these these jokers that are that are in
[01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:56.160]  the white house and running our federal government couldn't we find an attorney to prosecute all our
[01:26:56.160 --> 01:27:00.960]  millions of signatures for a citizen's arrest well that could be done the problem is the courts are
[01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:05.760]  so corrupt they would throw it out but there is the court of public opinion and if the people wake
[01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:12.160]  up and can't be led along with this corruption the the globalists will fail that's why the system
[01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:19.120]  has to lead false opposition or controlled opposition to control people and that's why the
[01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:24.400]  system's panicking and having to more and more go okay there is a world government there is a
[01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:31.520]  eugenics plan but in this new glenn backbook he shows both sides and kind of says maybe it's a
[01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:35.920]  good idea later in the week i'm gonna actually go through and read passage after passage but it's
[01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:41.280]  actually like a sick sales job where he admits the government's sponsoring terror but maybe they're
[01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:48.560]  doing it for order and he admits uh that the cia's mind controlling but maybe it's okay and he admits
[01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:56.080]  that they're doing all this tyranny but maybe they've got to do it and i appreciate your call okay
[01:27:56.960 --> 01:28:00.400]  by the way speaking of films i wasn't going to plug this because they're almost all sold out

[01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:39.520]  and they made jokes alex jones says the government's putting poisons in the water when they were here
[01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:43.520]  i gave them government documents where they talked about putting sodium fluoride in the water
[01:33:43.520 --> 01:33:47.360]  to reduce fertility i gave them government documents from the rockefeller foundation for
[01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:53.600]  the government and others talking about vaccines to sterilize you mainstream news promoting putting
[01:33:53.600 --> 01:34:00.400]  lithium in the water to make you passive you know i'm forced to cover hardcore news here
[01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:05.520]  it's kind of like in the last six seven eight years or even longer i'd play clips of congressional
[01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:12.560]  hearings where dinecore and halliburton running giant child kidnapping rings by the way dinecore
[01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:18.080]  in state of texas many other areas is the main cps contractors taking kids that's that's that's
[01:34:18.080 --> 01:34:26.080]  admitted i mean that's the type of issues we cover here's cnn today tens of millions of missing
[01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:31.840]  girls that's the headline give me a document cam shot for prison planet dot tv viewers tens of
[01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:42.720]  millions of missing girls and it goes on to say that in the last decade there are 30 million
[01:34:42.720 --> 01:34:48.480]  missing girls now a lot of them go to other countries to be prostitutes or to work in sweatshops
[01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:57.760]  but millions are sex slaves and major nations are doing this on record i remember two years ago it
[01:34:57.760 --> 01:35:04.560]  came out in the dutch news that israel was selling palestinians organs after they killed them in their
[01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:11.200]  presence and the end and israel was gonna go after the newspaper and then it came out in ap a few
[01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:15.920]  months later israeli doctors came out and said yeah we're doing it and china does it the us has
[01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:21.040]  been caught doing it i mean folks when you let corruption grow and grow and grow and deny it's
[01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:27.040]  there it's gonna run rampant and now here's cnn but they don't tell you who's doing it or why
[01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:32.640]  what do you think they do in these countries they occupy in eastern europe or africa or asia
[01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:37.120]  saudi arabia is one of the biggest countries doing it tens of millions of missing girls
[01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:42.720]  but i thought i would then give you a few prison planet articles from the last six seven years that

[01:36:58.160 --> 01:37:06.640]  you're on the air hi alex um ever since friday when you played this hit piece from um nightline
[01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:12.160]  i've been absolutely fuming foaming at the mouth fuming i can't believe i've had to write just a
[01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:18.400]  few points down i can't believe it dan harris is not only insulted you but insulted everyone
[01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:24.080]  not only your your audience but everyone they sent the host of of of the the abc nightly news
[01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:30.880]  down here that's dan harris go ahead he said the language he used to you was just so unbelievable
[01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:37.200]  for a journalist to even just even contemplate using but that's why they're hemorrhaging all
[01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:41.360]  their viewers people don't buy their baloney people say why would you let them come here
[01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:47.040]  they're so arrogant i knew they'd make a hit piece and then it would only wake people up more so bring
[01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:54.640]  it on right well when he talked about you you overstate your case to expose your more sinister
[01:37:54.640 --> 01:38:00.000]  theory i think we should send him a copy of machete to expose him to someone really sinister
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:07.040]  like robert rodriguez who is really dangerous and when you talked about your the syperus critics
[01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:13.360]  from the southern poverty law center please the you're floating highly charged ideas or i mean
[01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:20.000]  they said alex jones really concerns them and his millions of listeners and his growing power
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:27.920]  and oh my gosh he's exponentially growing what are we going to do but again by letting him come
[01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:34.320]  here and produce that hit piece we illustrate who they are right the thing that got me the most was
[01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:39.600]  when he said and your son knows the word propaganda well let me tell you alex i have listened to you
[01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:46.080]  since the days of public access when i lived over by where your old offices were and i you were the
[01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:51.440]  only news source i let my children listen to i would they did not watch cnn they did not watch
[01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:57.280]  anything else except you and they have grown up they're like 23 and 21 now and they are wonderful
[01:38:57.280 --> 01:39:02.800]  like renaissance people they're multi-talented they're not cheap people because i didn't let
[01:39:02.800 --> 01:39:12.160]  them listen to that propaganda so god bless you anything else jay jay that's it you go alex thank
[01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:18.640]  you jay jay look they were here for a whole day and edited down to a six and a half minute piece
[01:39:18.640 --> 01:39:25.760]  and and he said to me he said do you ever overstate your case well i'd be a liar if i said no i never
[01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:32.640]  i never overstate my case i said no i overstate my case sometimes but most of the time it's worse
[01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:40.480]  than i even thought and his issue there was that day i made the point that without even looking
[01:39:40.480 --> 01:39:46.000]  for it it was just all over the news four different news articles saying we need a one child policy in
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:51.680]  the united states or a one child policy would be good like communist china has and he took one of
[01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:57.840]  the four articles and said well this cnn piece is jokey it wasn't jokey it said this is good
[01:39:57.840 --> 01:40:02.640]  green sex only have one child and he said well don't you ever overstate your case and i said yeah
[01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:11.360]  i do maybe five percent of the time out of a hundred but i mean look we were on air
[01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:16.480]  ten years ago saying the end of the glass steagle act with top economists on this show
[01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:21.920]  was going to create tens of trillions in debt and bankrupt us by design and that the answer would
[01:40:21.920 --> 01:40:28.720]  be a global bank with carbon taxes exactly that happened not because i'm smart the club of rome
[01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:36.480]  the un our own government said that was the plan i had the articles from 1996 with ken lay of enron
[01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:43.200]  and others with al gore setting it up they said after we bring out the derivatives bubble we'll
[01:40:43.200 --> 01:40:50.560]  have a new one with carbon taxes they told us what they were going to do and these neocon talk show
[01:40:50.560 --> 01:40:55.920]  host get up on the air for decades and tell you there's no world government there's no international
[01:40:55.920 --> 01:41:01.040]  banks there's no move for any of this so you'd sit there on your butts instead of fighting it
[01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:07.760]  we know the democrats are out there supporting it they've got a bunch of domesticated bleeding
[01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:13.840]  heart well meaning morons that follow them but the system is worried about conservatives because
[01:41:13.840 --> 01:41:19.840]  they're more constitutional individually and so the republicans are going to be swept into
[01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:24.560]  office the democrats are in freefall that wasn't hard to predict everybody's victorious oh we're
[01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:29.440]  defeating obama he's a puppet now they're going to give you a right wing puppet right wing and
[01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:35.600]  name only wake up to the control system what did i read from glenn beck's book where he quotes
[01:41:35.600 --> 01:41:46.480]  the cia financed publication tragedy and hope only a thousand of these were printed but the
[01:41:46.480 --> 01:41:51.760]  plates for the book got out and that's why the public knows about this this was written because
[01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:58.240]  it's so complex government high level operatives this is what quickly wrote needed to understand
[01:41:58.240 --> 01:42:03.440]  the real system and he admits we're setting up a world government it controls the left the right
[01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:08.320]  fascist communist they're going to have a one-child policy they're going to totally take over i work
[01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:15.760]  for them is what he said 1968 and beck puts it in his book laughing at you the argument that the
[01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:22.560]  two parties should represent opposing ideals and policies is a foolish idea instead the two parties
[01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:27.200]  should be almost identical so the american people can throw the rascals out at any election without
[01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:33.680]  leading to any profound or extensive shifts of policy and then he goes on to say we control
[01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:40.720]  both parties that's what i'm telling you glenn beck will give you all the rhetoric that's true
[01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:47.600]  but then at key points he'll support value-added taxes banker bailouts the patriot act wars that
[01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:52.720]  are illegal and bankrupting us government sponsored terror in his new book he admits the
[01:42:52.720 --> 01:42:58.560]  government stage is terror but on a show he says you should be arrested if you say it you got it

[01:51:30.560 --> 01:51:35.040]  and the discussion came up with water quality i i pulled the class that they've been putting
[01:51:35.040 --> 01:51:41.520]  fluoride in our water um so the teacher you know turned it into a key to debate the teacher storms

[01:53:16.320 --> 01:53:20.880]  international order i just wanted to see maybe uh analysis by you or one of your writers well i
[01:53:20.880 --> 01:53:25.520]  haven't looked at did you say that was the 2010 national security strategy by the national
[01:53:25.520 --> 01:53:30.960]  security council run by general jones yes well it's out that's on white house dog yeah that's
[01:53:30.960 --> 01:53:36.960]  that's the one and uh just came out you know i haven't seen the 2010 strategy but general jones
[01:53:36.960 --> 01:53:43.360]  at cfr.org admitted he takes all his orders from the cfr which is illegal a private offshore think
[01:53:43.360 --> 01:53:50.480]  tank and no it's it listen the pentagon six years ago put out a report admitting they
[01:53:50.480 --> 01:53:56.480]  worked for world government and they had thomas barnett before that uh what naval war college
[01:53:56.480 --> 01:54:00.640]  professors say the same thing but no i haven't seen this new one so you're saying they just come
[01:54:00.640 --> 01:54:05.920]  right out with global government international order all over the place subsections big sections
[01:54:05.920 --> 01:54:11.360]  devoted to it they use the imf and united nations as examples of the order that they're setting up
[01:54:12.480 --> 01:54:17.440]  pretty clear and they say global governance sure they use that in there somewhere but
[01:54:17.440 --> 01:54:22.720]  international order is all over the place well it's standard operating procedure that's why they
[01:54:22.720 --> 01:54:28.000]  can't deny it but they'll have their controlled operatives come out and lead the opposition to
[01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:32.560]  it so at key points they can go along with it good points will look into it immediately who's up next
[01:54:32.560 --> 01:54:42.960]  guys josh in florida you're on the air worldwide hey alex how's it going welcome sir good excellent
[01:54:42.960 --> 01:54:48.160]  two points i want to uh touch on one i didn't hear you talk about yet but tomorrow night
[01:54:48.160 --> 01:54:54.080]  uh nine o'clock eastern standard time on the national geographic juliani is going to be
[01:54:54.080 --> 01:55:00.240]  talking at juliani's nine eleven he's going to say his own words i guess his his re accounts of
[01:55:00.880 --> 01:55:06.320]  of the events of that day so it'd be interesting just to watch and see if really i wonder if he'll
[01:55:06.320 --> 01:55:11.280]  talk about how they ran a drill to attack the world trade centers that morning called tripod
[01:55:11.280 --> 01:55:17.360]  two he'd admitted it on nine eleven on abc and cbs then he denied it till the videos were produced
[01:55:17.360 --> 01:55:22.240]  or the new nist footage the feds were sued to release uh where it confirms barry jennings and
[01:55:22.240 --> 01:55:26.240]  others in the building with bombs going off in building seven wonder we'll talk about that
[01:55:27.760 --> 01:55:31.920]  exactly or we'll see if he brings up his emergency command center that he had in building seven
[01:55:32.880 --> 01:55:38.720]  i wonder if he will we'll look into it thank you uh let's talk to shon and arizona shon
[01:55:38.720 --> 01:55:45.920]  you're on the air welcome patriot alex i've talked to you a couple times in the past and
[01:55:45.920 --> 01:55:51.840]  giving up your labor day weekend you know as all of us listening that uh uh we may not have labor
[01:55:51.840 --> 01:55:56.400]  day weekends to be free and party and get drunk and all these crazy things that people do anymore
[01:55:56.400 --> 01:56:02.240]  um you know the most important thing is to talk about freedom because uh we're freedom is in in
[01:56:02.240 --> 01:56:06.880]  its waning hours in america couple a couple salient points you know i called twice before
[01:56:06.880 --> 01:56:11.280]  because i was there around reagan at the convention and you started mentioning this today the most
[01:56:11.280 --> 01:56:18.320]  important thing is is we know now that republicans really are poised to to make um a big score here
[01:56:18.320 --> 01:56:23.760]  maybe gain back to the both houses here in the fall but it's not a victory for freedom and
[01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:28.480]  i saw that when i worked for reagan i was very young he was a great guy i liked him personally
[01:56:28.480 --> 01:56:33.920]  but the the week of the platform hearings in detroit which is the week before the the televised
[01:56:33.920 --> 01:56:38.960]  convention they came in and said you will put george w bush in george herbert walker bush
[01:56:38.960 --> 01:56:44.480]  who reagan and exposed as a trilateral commission globalist and rocker fellow i was 19 years old
[01:56:44.480 --> 01:56:49.680]  at the time and i was picking up these people they were surrounding him then and you know
[01:56:49.680 --> 01:56:54.400]  they've got their stooges we know glenn beck is one of them the big disappointment though is as a
[01:56:54.400 --> 01:57:00.160]  westerner uh this uh sarah palin uh you know i guess they've thrown a lot of money at her but
[01:57:00.160 --> 01:57:05.360]  what what a what a disappointment yeah she's the reason you got open border john mccain
[01:57:06.240 --> 01:57:13.040]  absolutely and you know mccain um i hate to say mccain's mccain's wife's father was tied to some
[01:57:13.040 --> 01:57:18.960]  very um very tough things yeah mccain's completely false but the thing about palin is you know her
[01:57:18.960 --> 01:57:25.120]  husband as pat you can and noted uh quickly on that first day that she was announced to the world
[01:57:25.120 --> 01:57:30.800]  in august uh a couple august ago two two years ago now you know her husband was part of the sage
[01:57:30.800 --> 01:57:36.640]  brush rebellion in alaska the separation movement and she apparently has just completely swung over
[01:57:36.640 --> 01:57:42.400]  and i i rather i'm out of time retransmission starts now at info wars.com if you missed any of
[01:57:42.400 --> 01:57:56.480]  the first hour i covered key intel great job crew have a great weekend be safe
