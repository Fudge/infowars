[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:28.000]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, here we are, can you even believe it?
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:45.320]  Friday, May 26th, 2023, time is certainly flying by, and the unstoppable force meeting
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:54.680]  the immovable object, the unstoppable force being the awakening of the planet, the citizens
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.200]  of this planet, the citizens of the United States of America, all the lies we've been
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:10.960]  told, all the corruption we've been forced to endure, the awakening is on, but the immovable
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:19.560]  object being the globalists, as we call them, the one world corporate government, the World
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:30.640]  Health Organization, the U.N., the U.S. government, and its agents committed to collapsing the
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.000]  U.S. into a one world government.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.400]  You see it with the open borders, you see it with the Biden administration saying, yes,
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:45.200]  the World Health Organization can have a say over health protocols in the country.
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.280]  So it's the unstoppable force, the awakening of humanity, versus the immovable object,
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.120]  the plan to enslave humanity and conquer the planet.
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.600]  That's the epic that we are in.
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:11.000]  And so everything you will see today is a result of that paradigm, of that phenomenon
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.280]  being revealed in real time.
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:26.440]  Now, there's an old saying, I hate to say, I told you so.
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.000]  And it kind of has a new meaning to me.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:39.520]  When I see stuff like this, the Heritage Foundation has exposed that the DHS, the Department of
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:46.800]  Homeland Security, has an anti-terrorism program that's been weaponized against conservatives.
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.720]  Eighty grants, 40 million taxpayer dollars later.
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.760]  And here's a look at how Joe Biden and Secretary Mayorkas are outsourcing their efforts to
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.400]  conflate conservatives with terrorists.
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.240]  And so it's an I hate to say I told you so moment.
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:11.640]  And I just, I thought I liked being right all the time.
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.520]  I hate being right about this.
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:20.800]  I hate that we were totally right, that InfoWars is totally vindicated, that the US government
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.280]  is being weaponized against you.
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:33.000]  And of course, they even have InfoWars on this list, as well as other groups like Breitbart
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.320]  . But then there's the old twist.
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.600]  There's the old lie, as they have a bunch of Nazi symbolism, Nazi logos, some of them
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:51.840]  are which still are embraced by the Ukrainian armies in eastern Ukraine, like the Azov Battalion,
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.720]  the Black Sun logo and so much more.
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:55.720]  But it's frustrating.
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.920]  Those are leftists.
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.880]  Socialism is a leftist ideology.
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:10.920]  Why do I still have to sit here as an anti socialist and respond to labels that somehow
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.760]  Nazism is a right wing value?
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:19.520]  It's not socialism is a left wing value.
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:27.560]  The National Socialist Workers Party of Adolf Hitler were the National Socialists Workers
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.560]  Party.
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.320]  Does that sound like right wing or left wing to you?
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.320]  Socialism is a left wing ideology, but of course, they put that at the top of the pyramid
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.200]  of far right radicalization.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:46.520]  So they take the worst of what the left is with the murderous, blood drenched socialist
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.760]  communist regimes of the 20th century.
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.480]  They take the worst of what the left has to represent and they say, nope, that's you on
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.480]  the right.
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:05:01.360]  No, it is actually us on the right that defeated the Nazis, see?
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.520]  Sold out for more than a year.
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.720]  We now have back in stock a limited run of our extremely popular tooth whitening coral
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:14.680]  calcium toothpaste full of essential oils back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.

[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:36.160]  Here we are on this Friday, May 26th, 2023 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Owen Troyer
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:42.760]  broadcasting live from the InfoWare's world headquarters in Austin, Texas.
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.240]  Still on the air.
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.600]  Thank you, God.
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.000]  Thank you to the audience.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.360]  We are still here fighting tyranny every day, fighting the fake news, the lies, the propaganda
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:07:00.480]  aimed against you, targeted at you.
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.100]  They thought we'd be off air by now.
[00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:07.920]  They thought they could silence us by now, but they haven't.
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:14.000]  So now they've ratcheted up with the U.S. government and the American left.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.520]  They have ratcheted up their attacks on the U.S. citizens.
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:21.800]  They have ratcheted up their political persecution.
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:26.520]  They're at a bit of a stalemate on the censorship issue right now with Elon Musk taking over
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:28.520]  Twitter.
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:37.280]  But believe me, believe me, as we get closer to the 2024 election, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:41.440]  I believe the political persecution will be ramped up and the censorship will be ramped
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:42.440]  up.
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:52.480]  At the same time, I think the American citizens are more aware of what to be ready for, what
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:55.280]  to be cautious of.
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:58.360]  And if they start rolling out the censorship again and the political persecution again,
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:04.880]  they will just continue to further expose themselves as the evildoers in this country, that being
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:11.200]  the corruption at the FBI, at the DOJ, the Biden administration and everything else down
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.200]  the line.
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:18.680]  Now, we're going to be talking more on that subject with Viva Free from the Viva Free and
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.400]  Barnes podcast.
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:24.960]  So attorney Viva Free is going to be joining me to discuss that, as well as some other
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:25.960]  things.
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:27.800]  Viva Fry, thank you.
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:28.800]  Thank you, crew.
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:32.040]  Apologize to Viva.
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:38.080]  Now one of the big stories this week, to me, there's two big stories this week.
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:41.600]  And I was thinking about just taking calls and asking you, what do you think is the big
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:46.300]  story once I get rid of all this news on my desk?
[00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:52.000]  The clear cut corruption with the FBI and the Durham report, and it's like seemingly
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.520]  nothing can get done.
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:57.480]  And we just have to sit here and accept that the FBI is totally corrupt.
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:01.440]  Our government's totally corrupt and it can be weaponized against you and you have no
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:02.440]  recourse.
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:06.280]  You're doomed.
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:16.360]  And the DHS with, well, rather the DOJ, the FBI and the IRS, all running cover, all caught,
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:19.200]  all on record.
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.200]  Dozens of whistleblowers.
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.640]  We've heard from, I think, seven whistleblowers on this.
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:25.720]  Folks, there might be a hundred.
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:29.120]  A lot of these whistleblowers that are coming forward to members of Congress don't want
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:30.240]  to be known.
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:33.720]  They fear for their lives, literally.
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:39.480]  They are scared for their lives.
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.800]  About being a whistleblower, calling out the corruption from the Biden crime family, calling
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:46.640]  out the corruption at the FBI, the IRS, what have you.
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.720]  I expect there to be more whistleblowers.
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.680]  I expect more people to go public.
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:56.920]  Sadly, I'm not sure what I expect from Republicans in Congress as far as doing the right thing
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:07.640]  or stopping all of this because they play this game of playing by the rules.
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:13.080]  And they still don't realize that playing by the rules is what loses because the Democrats
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:17.280]  and the corruption in the federal government, they don't play by the rules.
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.160]  So you're sitting here playing by the rules.
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.240]  They're not.
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.840]  You're sitting here shooting free throws from the free throw line.
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:26.720]  They're walking up, putting up layups.
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:28.520]  You're saying, hey, that's not a free throw.
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:29.520]  You're supposed to be at the line.
[00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:30.760]  They're saying, screw you, buddy.
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:32.400]  I made more baskets than you.
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:34.120]  Well, yeah, you're shooting layups.
[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.120]  I'm shooting free throws.
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:36.120]  That's not fair.
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:37.320]  Well, that's your fault.
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:43.680]  Now, I'm hearing mixed reports on what's going on with the debt negotiations with McConnell,
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:47.600]  excuse me, McCarthy and Biden today.
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.040]  Biden has another flub.
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:50.040]  He goes to Japan.
[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:52.760]  He calls President Yoon, President Loon.
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:53.760]  Wow.
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:54.760]  What an embarrassment.
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:58.200]  What an insult to Japan from our embarrassment.
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.200]  Joe Biden.
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.400]  He does it again.
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.880]  Joe Biden screws up congressman's name and audience during White House event in Rose
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:04.880]  Garden.
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:09.360]  So they're protecting this decrepit old corrupt fool.
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:14.160]  They're protecting the so-called president of the United States that can't even wipe
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.120]  his own ass.
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:21.560]  And it's him and his son acting as foreign agents illegally, totally being covered up
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:28.760]  and protected by the FBI, the DOJ and the IRS.
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:34.640]  So we're talking with Viva Fry about that, maybe taking your calls on that, as well
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:41.400]  as the other big story from this week, which has to be the pushback against the sexual
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.360]  propaganda aimed at children.
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:44.360]  And that's what it is.
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:52.880]  And look, I'm not going to obsess over messaging on this because it really doesn't matter.
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:54.040]  We know what this is about.
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:59.080]  This isn't about adults consenting to whatever it is they want to do in privacy.
[00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:04.780]  This isn't about people that are adults wanting to mutilate their bodies or whatever else
[00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:06.560]  they're into sexually.
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:08.200]  That's not what this is about.
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:13.160]  So I'm not even going to sit here and respond to the left wing commentary acting like this
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:18.160]  is transphobia or homophobia or that we're even addressing what adults like to do in
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.320]  their free time, in their privacy.
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.540]  That's not what this is about.
[00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:24.320]  This is about the children.
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:30.200]  This is about the sexual propaganda and grooming and abuse of the children by the American
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.200]  left calling it pride.
[00:12:32.418 --> 00:12:40.538]  So, I don't even think it's necessary to respond when they just say, you're just transphobic,
[00:12:40.538 --> 00:12:41.758]  you're just homophobic.
[00:12:41.758 --> 00:12:43.458]  You know that's not true.
[00:12:43.458 --> 00:12:45.578]  You know that's not what this is about.
[00:12:45.578 --> 00:12:47.378]  You know this is about the children.
[00:12:47.378 --> 00:12:48.378]  Stop lying.
[00:12:48.378 --> 00:12:53.058]  I don't even feel like we have to address that or really be concerned with the messaging.
[00:12:53.058 --> 00:12:54.258]  I think people see through it now.
[00:12:54.258 --> 00:13:00.098]  I think they know what's really going on, especially when you see stories like this.
[00:13:00.098 --> 00:13:05.578]  Pride celebration organizers grapple with new Florida laws on drag and transgender rights.
[00:13:05.578 --> 00:13:10.938]  So, in other words, people that host pride parades.
[00:13:10.938 --> 00:13:15.618]  Now, what is the new Florida law that they're talking about?
[00:13:15.618 --> 00:13:22.978]  Well, the new Florida law says you can't do nude or lewd activities in public in front
[00:13:22.978 --> 00:13:26.678]  of children, which is not even new laws.
[00:13:26.678 --> 00:13:33.718]  They just have to reiterate and re-litigate this stuff now because the American left has
[00:13:33.718 --> 00:13:39.598]  turned everything ... like, normally, you wouldn't be able to show pornographic images
[00:13:39.598 --> 00:13:45.878]  to children in a classroom, but if you say it's LGBTQ+, then it's okay.
[00:13:45.878 --> 00:13:52.998]  Normally, you wouldn't be able to go up to a child at a library or at a parade or in
[00:13:52.998 --> 00:14:03.158]  a restaurant and have a man in a leotard or in a thong with his bulge or his genitals
[00:14:03.158 --> 00:14:06.958]  popping out and him sticking his ass in the air in front of children.
[00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:12.198]  Normally, that would already be illegal, but when you say it's LGBTQ+, or pride, then they
[00:14:12.198 --> 00:14:13.358]  are able to get away with it.
[00:14:13.358 --> 00:14:21.078]  Well, so DeSantis has just directly addressed this in response to the pride sword and shield
[00:14:21.078 --> 00:14:25.998]  that the American left uses to go after children, and so he says, no, if you want to have your
[00:14:25.998 --> 00:14:27.238]  pride parades, that's fine.
[00:14:27.238 --> 00:14:31.758]  There'll be no nudity, and there'll be no lewd content directed at children, and so
[00:14:31.758 --> 00:14:36.638]  the pride parade organizers are saying, well, I don't know what we're going to do now.
[00:14:37.972 --> 00:14:43.972]  I don't know what we'll do now. Really? So I guess that shows you everything.
[00:14:43.972 --> 00:14:49.972]  If they make a rule, you're not allowed to play basketball with a ball.
[00:14:49.972 --> 00:14:53.972]  Well, gee, I guess you don't have a game anymore, do you?
[00:14:53.972 --> 00:15:00.972]  So when you tell the gay pride parade organizers that you're not allowed to have nudity or lewd actions towards children,
[00:15:00.972 --> 00:15:04.972]  that's like the ball in basketball. There's no pride parade now.
[00:15:04.972 --> 00:15:10.972]  They don't know what to do. We can't be nude in public.
[00:15:10.972 --> 00:15:16.972]  We can't have lewd activity directed towards children. I don't know what we'll do.
[00:15:16.972 --> 00:15:22.972]  How are we going to have pride parade without a nudity or lewd actions of children?
[00:15:22.972 --> 00:15:29.972]  Oh, what will we do? Oh, the bigotry. Oh, the intolerance. Oh, the transphobia, the homophobia.
[00:15:30.972 --> 00:15:36.972]  No, I think it's pretty obvious now what's really going on when they set up pride sections in the children's aisle
[00:15:36.972 --> 00:15:40.972]  and they have pride toddler apparel.
[00:15:40.972 --> 00:15:46.972]  No, let's not. Let's not. Let's not be confused.
[00:15:46.972 --> 00:15:50.972]  It's directly targeting the children.
[00:15:50.972 --> 00:15:53.972]  So those are the two big news stories this week.
[00:15:53.972 --> 00:15:57.972]  We'll have the rest of the news from today on The Alex Jones Show.
[00:15:59.972 --> 00:16:05.972]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution is laying right there in front of you, hidden in plain view.
[00:16:05.972 --> 00:16:08.972]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[00:16:08.972 --> 00:16:11.972]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website,
[00:16:11.972 --> 00:16:17.972]  where they admit the number one cause of cognitive disability in the world is iodine deficiency.
[00:16:17.972 --> 00:16:25.972]  The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability is lack of real, pure iodine in the body
[00:16:25.972 --> 00:16:30.972]  as they bomb us with the bad halogens, bromine, bromide, chlorine, and so much more.
[00:16:30.972 --> 00:16:37.972]  Upwards of 2 billion people in a Lancet medical journal study in 2007 worldwide have cognitive disabilities
[00:16:37.972 --> 00:16:40.972]  because they don't have high quality iodine.
[00:16:40.972 --> 00:16:43.972]  Most iodine is bound to other elements you don't absorb it.
[00:16:43.972 --> 00:16:48.972]  We have X3, all three types of good iodine together that supercharges your body.
[00:16:48.972 --> 00:16:51.972]  X3 is now back in stock at InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:16:51.972 --> 00:16:54.972]  It's been sold out for over six months for 25% off.

[00:16:58.972 --> 00:17:04.972]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson and take him off the air.
[00:17:04.972 --> 00:17:07.972]  People said, no way, he's the most popular thing that ever happened.
[00:17:07.972 --> 00:17:09.972]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[00:17:09.972 --> 00:17:12.972]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him.
[00:17:12.972 --> 00:17:15.972]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[00:17:15.972 --> 00:17:17.972]  It's the same thing with InfoWars.
[00:17:17.972 --> 00:17:23.972]  But InfoWars is not owned by Fox or controlled by George Soros or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[00:17:23.972 --> 00:17:26.972]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[00:17:26.972 --> 00:17:29.972]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[00:17:29.972 --> 00:17:34.972]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[00:17:34.972 --> 00:17:37.972]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[00:17:37.972 --> 00:17:40.972]  So I want to thank you for your support and encourage viewers and listeners to understand,
[00:17:40.972 --> 00:17:43.972]  please don't take InfoWars for granted.
[00:17:43.972 --> 00:17:45.972]  We're barely hanging on.
[00:17:45.972 --> 00:17:48.972]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support,
[00:17:48.972 --> 00:17:51.972]  while getting great products at the same time at InfoWarsTour.com.

[00:17:55.972 --> 00:17:58.972]  and never submit to these tyrants.
[00:17:58.972 --> 00:18:05.972]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into the atmosphere.
[00:18:05.972 --> 00:18:08.972]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[00:18:08.972 --> 00:18:13.972]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers
[00:18:13.972 --> 00:18:19.972]  to convert these gases into fluorosilicic acid, still highly toxic but containable.
[00:18:19.972 --> 00:18:22.972]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison,
[00:18:22.972 --> 00:18:25.972]  and there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[00:18:25.972 --> 00:18:30.972]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the Secretary of the Treasury,
[00:18:30.972 --> 00:18:33.972]  who was responsible for the public health service at the time.
[00:18:33.972 --> 00:18:40.972]  And by 1950, the U.S. government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product
[00:18:40.972 --> 00:18:42.972]  and dumping it into our drinking water.
[00:18:42.972 --> 00:18:47.972]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[00:18:48.972 --> 00:18:54.972]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water, and a remedy to this madness.
[00:18:54.972 --> 00:18:58.972]  Available now at InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:18:58.972 --> 00:19:01.972]  There is a war for the future happening right now.
[00:19:01.972 --> 00:19:06.972]  There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny, our children's destinies.
[00:19:06.972 --> 00:19:11.972]  And that war is something that we can win, but it takes dedication, it takes commitment.
[00:19:11.972 --> 00:19:15.972]  That's why I ask listeners respectfully to go to InfoWarsTour.com

[00:20:00.972 --> 00:20:07.972]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:13.640]  This video is a derivative work of the Touhou Project. It has no relation to the original work.
[00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:44.140]  This video is a derivative work of the Touhou Project. It has no relation to the original work.
[00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:18.140]  ...to new legislation from Ron DeSantis that says you can't have nude or lewd activity in public at your parades,
[00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:21.140]  and they're saying, we don't know what to do now.
[00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:29.140]  We thought getting nude in the streets and having lewd activity for children, that's what our pride parades were all about.
[00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:34.140]  That's like saying you are going to play football without the football.
[00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:39.140]  If we can't target children with our nude, lewd activity, we don't have a pride parade.
[00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:43.140]  Tells you everything actually, doesn't it?
[00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:49.140]  Now, the focus has been on Target, but there have been some other stories here too,
[00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:54.140]  but ladies and gentlemen, I've got to say, I'm changing my stance now today.
[00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:57.140]  I'm changing my stance now today. I didn't realize how bad it was.
[00:21:57.140 --> 00:22:06.140]  As you can see on the screen, look at what conservatives have done to a Target in response to the pride section for kids.
[00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:12.140]  Just look at what they did. They went into this Target and they completely destroyed it.
[00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:24.140]  White supremacists going around Target to Target and completely destroying it and looting it and leaving it in complete shambles.
[00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:30.140]  And so I think it's time for us to really do some self-reflecting here.
[00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:41.140]  And I think it's time for us to really look at these images that you see on the screen and realize that this type of activity is unacceptable
[00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:45.140]  and should not be promoted or endorsed by anyone.
[00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:53.140]  Just look at these white supremacist Christians looting a Target, stealing everything, walking out the front door, bashing in the windows.
[00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:57.140]  You can see the damage. You can see the destruction. You can see the chaos.
[00:22:57.140 --> 00:23:03.140]  Just look at the white supremacists. Look at the conservative Christians. Look at the Republican voters.
[00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:08.140]  And so this is all footage that we're just seeing now for the first time. I can't even believe it.
[00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:12.140]  They just walk right into a Target and they just steal anything they want.
[00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:15.140]  They walk right into the Target. They light things on fire.
[00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:19.140]  It causes the fire alarms to go off and the sprinklers to go off.
[00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:24.140]  Then everything in the store gets ruined because of the overflow of water.
[00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:36.140]  I mean, just the lack of respect, the lack of decency, the violence, the crime, the criminal activity, the just complete destruction of these stores.
[00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:40.140]  Look at these white supremacists. Look at these homophobes.
[00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:52.140]  Look at these transphobes as they go into Target to protest Pride Month and they steal everything they want and they light the buildings on fire and they loot it.
[00:23:52.140 --> 00:24:03.140]  And so at this point in time, anybody who is not condemning this activity and anybody who is not calling out these white supremacists
[00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:12.140]  and anybody who is not calling out these Christian conservatives and their vile, disgusting behavior in response to Pride Month
[00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:18.140]  by looting Targets and destroying Targets, smashing their windows, burning their stores to the ground.
[00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:21.140]  We have to do some serious self-reflecting here, folks.
[00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:24.140]  Look at that white supremacist running out with all that stolen merchandise.
[00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:34.140]  And so my mind has obviously been changed and we cannot condone this type of violence at Target in response to Pride Month.
[00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:37.140]  It just, it cannot be had. I mean, just look at this image.
[00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:42.140]  Look at what the homophobes have done to Target.
[00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:52.140]  Just look at what the conservative Christian Republicans have done to Targets all because of the Pride section for children.
[00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:57.140]  Christian conservatives, Republicans burning Targets to the ground, looting them.
[00:24:57.140 --> 00:25:02.140]  Just total chaos, total destruction, total criminal activity.
[00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:07.140]  And so, folks, we have to call this out.
[00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:11.140]  We have to join the American left in condoning this activity at Target.
[00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:15.140]  It's too much. It's violent, criminal activity.
[00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:21.140]  And it must be stopped in response to the Pride displays for kids at Targets.
[00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:25.140]  This violence cannot go on. This intolerance cannot go on.
[00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:31.140]  Over a hundred Targets had to be shut down because of this activity.
[00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:37.140]  Here it is again, more white supremacist Christian conservatives in response to the Pride section for kids,
[00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:40.140]  stealing and looting and burning and running rampant.
[00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:44.140]  It just must be stopped, folks. It's just too much.
[00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:47.140]  Oh, oh, what's that now?
[00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:50.140]  I'm sorry, I'm getting some information in my ear here.
[00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:57.140]  Oh, oh, this is not the Pride protests that we're witnessing here?
[00:25:57.140 --> 00:26:01.140]  This is not conservative Christians and Republicans running in and looting Target
[00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:05.140]  and doing smash and grabs and burning Targets to the ground in the middle of the night?
[00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:09.140]  Wait, this isn't the Pride protest?
[00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:14.140]  This isn't conservative Christians upset that isn't Target boarding up their windows and doors
[00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:19.140]  because of the conservatives upset that they're aiming Pride propaganda at children?
[00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:26.140]  That's not what this is? I'm not watching conservative Christians doing smash and grabs at Targets to protest Pride?
[00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:31.140]  Oh, oh, that's, oh, I'm sorry, wait, what?
[00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:36.140]  Oh, this is, oh, this is the, these are Democrats?
[00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:41.140]  Wait a second, but I was told, hold on, these are Democrats here?
[00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:44.140]  These are, wait, this is the American left?
[00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:49.140]  Wait, you're telling me I'm watching footage of the American left doing smash and grabs at Targets
[00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:53.140]  all across the country that resulted in 175 of them closing?
[00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:58.140]  Wait a second, you're telling me I'm looking at liberals from Black Lives Matter and Antifa groups
[00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:04.140]  doing smash and grabs and looting runs and Targets, completely destroying them?
[00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:10.140]  Wait a second, hold on, but I, but I, but wait, but I, but I saw the outrage.
[00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:14.140]  But I saw the outrage from the American left because somebody walked into a Target
[00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:17.140]  and said they didn't like the Pride section for kids, I saw the left's outrage.
[00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:20.140]  You're telling me this is how they behave at Target?
[00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:26.140]  Wait a second, wait, you're telling, hold on, you're telling me that I am supposed to be
[00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:31.140]  listening to these people when it comes to morals and how to protest?
[00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:34.140]  Hold on, I'm confused, this can't be.
[00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:42.140]  No, no, surely, surely I'm being deceived, surely my eyes are not.
[00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:46.140]  This isn't, no, this isn't the American left's response to something they didn't like
[00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:49.140]  that has nothing to even do with Target.
[00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:54.140]  Oh my gosh, I've, I've been tricked, I've been had.
[00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:58.140]  I can't even, they got one by me.
[00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:01.140]  This is the American left destroying Targets.
[00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:06.140]  This is the Democrat party promoted activity destroying Targets, the smash and grabs,
[00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:09.140]  the looting, the breaking of the windows, the fires.
[00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:18.140]  But how, but they, I, I saw, but they said that we were bad because a couple people
[00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:21.140]  were upset with the Pride section for kids.
[00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:24.140]  I thought that was, that was them?
[00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:27.140]  Wait, that was the American left?
[00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:33.140]  The American left that scolded you because you didn't like a Pride section for kids at Target?
[00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:38.140]  The American left that scolded you because you filmed the tuck clothing for children?
[00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:41.140]  The chest binders for children?
[00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:44.140]  The Pride for toddlers for children?
[00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:48.140]  The one, wait, that was them?
[00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:53.140]  They were the ones telling you you're bad?
[00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:55.140]  I don't understand.
[00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:56.140]  How could this be?
[00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:57.140]  The American left?
[00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:58.140]  No.
[00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:02.140]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:04.140]  Please write this down and please go look this up.
[00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:06.140]  It will change your life.
[00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:11.140]  The UN admits and the Lansing Medical Journal admits that upwards of two billion people
[00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:15.140]  have mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities.
[00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:20.140]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:25.140]  Most iodine in the environment is bound to other elements so your body can't absorb it.
[00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:30.140]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:37.140]  And Infowarsstore.com has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of full effect.
[00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:40.140]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3's been sold out for six months.

[00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:50.140]  You and your family need it.
[00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:52.140]  It's 25% off back in stock.

[00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:04.140]  This is Adam King, host of The Adam King Show, joined by the one and only Greg Reese of The Reese Report.
[00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:07.140]  We wanted to hop on and send everybody to Infowarsstore.com.

[00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:16.140]  Buy yourself a Faraday cage, super male vitality, or what Greg has.
[00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:17.140]  Greg, what do you got there?
[00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:22.140]  If you really want to treat yourself to something nice, get yourself an Alexa Pure water filter
[00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:26.140]  and get clean, healthy water whenever you want it, wherever you want it.
[00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:31.140]  Even if the water pressure goes out, the gravity-fed water filter has got you covered.
[00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:33.140]  Absolutely.
[00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:38.140]  And we couldn't do any of this without listener support.
[00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:43.140]  I was telling Greg earlier, we're like the real NPR, the real NPR of the base, right?

[00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:00.140]  Support the Infowar.
[00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:02.140]  Turbo Force is back.
[00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:05.140]  Sold out for eight months, and it's Turbo Force Plus.
[00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:07.140]  We made it even stronger.
[00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:11.140]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:18.140]  Turbo Force is back in stock at Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:24.140]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:26.140]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:31.140]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids
[00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:38.140]  that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:41.140]  It is the super fuel.
[00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:43.140]  Rain Force Plus is great.
[00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:44.140]  Rain Force Ultra is great.
[00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:45.140]  They're two different nootropics.
[00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:46.140]  They go good with this.
[00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:48.140]  But this is the King Kong.
[00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:50.140]  This is the boss.
[00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:54.140]  Turbo Force, back in stock, discounted, Infowarsstore.com.
[00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:57.140]  More power, more strength, more energy.
[00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:03.140]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on Earth.
[00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:06.140]  And they've got our children drinking that.
[00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:09.140]  This is a psychotic death cult.
[00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:10.140]  Period.
[00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:11.140]  Case closed.
[00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:12.140]  Out to get you and your family.
[00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:17.140]  We sell the Alexa Pure Breeze made by the MyPatriotSupply Ready Hour Group.
[00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:18.140]  It's been around about 15 years.
[00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:20.140]  It became the biggest company in the last six.
[00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:25.140]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system ever.
[00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:28.140]  The fancy best water filter system out there that sells for twice the price.
[00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:32.140]  And they made it as good in all the studies.
[00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:34.140]  It reduces things to non-detectable levels.
[00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:35.140]  Thousands of chemicals.
[00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:37.140]  But you can go paint two or three times.
[00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:39.140]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:45.140]  We sell the very best highest grade water filtration system for half the price of a leading competitor.
[00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:50.140]  And the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter your water.
[00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:52.140]  You should also filter your shower water.
[00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:53.140]  That's another way you absorb this crap.
[00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:55.140]  But I'm done talking about that.
[00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:58.140]  The point is you get the filters at InfoWarstore.com.
[00:32:58.140 --> 00:32:59.140]  They're discounted right now.
[00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:00.140]  Finally back in stock.
[00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:05.140]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:07.140]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:27.429]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show, and now
[00:33:27.429 --> 00:33:30.610]  your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:33:30.610 --> 00:33:36.310]  And I'm joined by Viva Frye, great lawyer and show host.
[00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:44.909]  The Viva Frye podcast also goes on with Robert Barnes, VivaBarnesLaw.Locals.com.
[00:33:44.909 --> 00:33:49.070]  And Viva, I mean, there's all kinds of stuff we can talk about today, but let's deal with
[00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:50.689]  the elephant in the room.
[00:33:50.689 --> 00:33:54.850]  Let's deal with the big monstrosity that we're all looking at here.
[00:33:54.850 --> 00:34:01.330]  We now know for a fact, it's unequivocal, the FBI, the IRS, the DOJ have been running
[00:34:01.330 --> 00:34:04.350]  cover and protection for the Biden crime family.
[00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:08.830]  It is essentially the sword and the shield of the Democrat Party corruption at this
[00:34:08.830 --> 00:34:09.830]  point.
[00:34:09.830 --> 00:34:14.150]  Multiple whistleblowers, at least seven on record that we know of, my guess is dozens
[00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:17.390]  are still behind the wings waiting to go public.
[00:34:17.390 --> 00:34:23.630]  Viva, you see this, what goes through your head as a lawyer?
[00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:24.630]  What goes through my head?
[00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:29.509]  I think back to what Alex Jones said when he was on for a sidebar a Wednesday night
[00:34:29.509 --> 00:34:32.509]  where he said, they use the same tactics over and over again.
[00:34:32.509 --> 00:34:35.590]  It's the same play in the playbook over and over again.
[00:34:35.590 --> 00:34:38.910]  What's amazing is that it continues to work over and over again.
[00:34:38.910 --> 00:34:45.590]  In recent memory, in the last, it's now seven years, eight years, we've lived through exposing
[00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:52.430]  the 2016 Russiagate basically as a disguised coup, if it was disguised at all.
[00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:55.950]  It was a nonviolent coup to unseat unelected president.
[00:34:55.950 --> 00:35:03.029]  We now know that that was entirely fabricated by the DNC in collusion with intelligence
[00:35:03.029 --> 00:35:07.830]  that was using the media to, you know, leak and launder disinformation to undermine a
[00:35:07.830 --> 00:35:09.790]  duly elected president.
[00:35:09.790 --> 00:35:11.910]  Come fast forward to 2020.
[00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:17.029]  We now know that intelligence knew that the Hunter Biden laptop, which they told the world
[00:35:17.029 --> 00:35:20.190]  was, you know, bore the earmarks of Russia disinformation.
[00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:24.190]  They had had it in their possession since 2019, knew it was legitimate, knew it was
[00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:29.029]  authentic as they were meeting with big tech social media platforms to censor the truth
[00:35:29.029 --> 00:35:30.990]  in advance of the 2020 election.
[00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:37.390]  And now we're seeing them handing down sentences in January 6 that, you know, make Putin look
[00:35:37.390 --> 00:35:41.870]  equally bad by comparison, 18 years for Rhodes for seditious conspiracy.
[00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:47.590]  And now we know that basically they've been working with or at the very least to help
[00:35:47.590 --> 00:35:51.549]  the Biden family get into power, because I guess, you know, you have to destroy democracy
[00:35:51.549 --> 00:35:52.910]  in order to preserve it.
[00:35:53.029 --> 00:35:58.750]  Well, correct me if I'm wrong here, too, because I keep seeing this judge now in the Rhodes
[00:35:58.750 --> 00:36:04.430]  case, apparently before he leaves the courtroom, gets a little lecture like she's a like she's
[00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:08.549]  his professor or something in a college course, gives him a lecture on stuff.
[00:36:08.549 --> 00:36:10.150]  Is that par for the course?
[00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:14.549]  Have you seen this before as a lawyer, like the judge, like she's at a lectern lecturing
[00:36:14.549 --> 00:36:15.549]  students?
[00:36:15.549 --> 00:36:16.549]  I've never.
[00:36:16.549 --> 00:36:19.630]  First of all, I, I trained in Quebec.
[00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:21.270]  I only did civil law.
[00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:25.049]  So I have no experience with criminal or federal American cases.
[00:36:25.049 --> 00:36:27.830]  But this is what it looks like, at least to me.
[00:36:27.830 --> 00:36:32.230]  And, you know, other people can disagree if their experience says otherwise.
[00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:35.210]  This is like it's like political activism on the bench.
[00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:41.830]  And they've gone from being judges to being, you know, lecturers of sorts.
[00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:43.150]  It's I don't think it's normal.
[00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:48.230]  I think what it shows is the deep, inherent bias of these judges who are adjudicating
[00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:51.950]  in cases where they perceive them or they perceive themselves to have been the victims
[00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:52.950]  or the targets.
[00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:56.990]  I mean, everything that we're seeing now out of the judicial system from January 6,
[00:36:56.990 --> 00:37:02.270]  you basically have judges who view themselves as having been the target of the insurrection
[00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:06.990]  now adjudicating over and, you know, rendering sentences to the people that they think came
[00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:10.750]  to harm them, came to their came to their Capitol Hill to harm them.
[00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:15.830]  You know, like I've talked about with Barnes over and over again on our channel.
[00:37:15.830 --> 00:37:18.790]  This should have been venue changed.
[00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:20.590]  But you're never going to get that.
[00:37:20.590 --> 00:37:22.549]  You're never going to get that because the people determining the change of venue are
[00:37:22.549 --> 00:37:24.350]  the ones who want to adjudicate on this.
[00:37:24.350 --> 00:37:28.870]  But you have you have judges, prosecutors, political parties who are emotionally and
[00:37:28.870 --> 00:37:34.750]  politically invested in the situation to ensure that a certain political outcome arises
[00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:39.670]  so that it can then be weaponized to as the judge in the roads.
[00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:44.350]  I keep getting between Proud Boys and Oath Keepers conviction saying, you know, this this
[00:37:44.350 --> 00:37:46.270]  shall serve as a warning to others.
[00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:49.590]  It sure will that you don't even have the right to think you don't have the right to
[00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:53.310]  get angry and you don't have the right to protest, because if you protest and they say
[00:37:53.310 --> 00:37:57.470]  it's terrorism, you're getting terrorism enhancement and going to jail for a near quarter of a
[00:37:57.470 --> 00:37:58.470]  century.
[00:37:58.470 --> 00:38:03.910]  Well, and just to kind of sidestep on this issue and bring it more home.
[00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:06.310]  I wish that that was the universal message.
[00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:07.590]  Well, not necessarily.
[00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:10.910]  I just wish anything was consistent because we know it's not consistent.
[00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:15.029]  We see people riding and looting and engaging in all kinds of criminal activity and getting
[00:38:15.029 --> 00:38:20.830]  a pass or even having it promoted and supported by certain political movements or members
[00:38:20.830 --> 00:38:21.830]  of the media.
[00:38:21.830 --> 00:38:23.950]  And so let me just ask you this.
[00:38:23.950 --> 00:38:28.870]  What kind of similarities do you see with these developments in America between what
[00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:34.390]  you saw in Canada with Trudeau going after the truckers and some of the political speech
[00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:37.110]  that was being stymied there?
[00:38:37.110 --> 00:38:42.950]  A funny thing is I actually had on a lawyer just the other day where we obviously disagreed
[00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:44.509]  politically.
[00:38:44.509 --> 00:38:48.430]  And I know I said, well, I view the I view the people that were being detained for five
[00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:53.310]  months in pretrial detention in Canada for nonviolent mischief charges.
[00:38:53.310 --> 00:38:55.430]  I view them as political prisoners.
[00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:58.990]  And the lawyer who I respect for having come on my channel and had a discussion says, you
[00:38:58.990 --> 00:39:01.470]  know, I don't view them as political prisoners.
[00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:06.590]  You know, it's surprising that some protocol was, you know, it's surprising that they were
[00:39:06.590 --> 00:39:10.670]  held for so long for nonviolent mischief charges, but I don't view them as political prisoners.
[00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:12.390]  And I'm like, well, I think we see the same thing.
[00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:14.310]  We're just calling it something different.
[00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:21.029]  What we are seeing is the full political ideological capture of all levels of government law enforcement
[00:39:21.029 --> 00:39:24.470]  and the judicial process, in my humble opinion.
[00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:29.150]  And when you have people who are being arrested for protest, because that's all that it was
[00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:35.390]  in Canada and then detained for months on end without getting bail for nonviolent mischief
[00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:41.190]  charges, while simultaneously you have a dude who ran his car into four protesters in Winnipeg
[00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:44.670]  released on bail, albeit a lot of bail, but released nonetheless.
[00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:47.950]  I mean, what we're seeing in Canada is what we're seeing in the States.
[00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:52.430]  You got the Molotov cocktail lawyers out of New York, not not only not being sentenced
[00:39:52.430 --> 00:39:57.830]  to 18 years, agreeing to a plea deal that the prosecutors then agree to reopen and reduce
[00:39:57.830 --> 00:40:03.150]  after they agree to a plea deal, Molotov cocktail throwing lawyers.
[00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:08.310]  What you have with January 6, people who were, some of it might have gotten violent and some
[00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:10.110]  of it did get violent.
[00:40:10.110 --> 00:40:15.270]  Rhodes, the Oath Keepers, they weren't even on site, sorry, they were on site, didn't
[00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:20.590]  bring guns, didn't, you know, a seditious conspiracy where, according to the prosecution,
[00:40:20.590 --> 00:40:22.190]  their biggest regret was not bringing guns.
[00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:25.590]  Well, that's one heck of a seditious conspiracy, terroristic overthrow of the government to
[00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:28.230]  forget weapons with which to do it.
[00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:34.350]  But getting the most egregious sentences, whereas simultaneously you have America looking
[00:40:34.350 --> 00:40:38.950]  at Russia and saying Putin is an, you know, what is an authoritarian autocrat or whatever
[00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:44.830]  the word is, a totalitarian dictator for sentencing journalists to jail for 25 years.
[00:40:44.830 --> 00:40:50.110]  Well, you know, it's it's different only by degree, but not by nature.
[00:40:50.110 --> 00:40:51.430]  And they are political prisoners.
[00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:55.790]  The system has been weaponized to go after wrong think when it's ideologically and politically
[00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:59.550]  convenient and to forgive it when it's ideologically and politically convenient.
[00:40:59.550 --> 00:41:04.990]  As we saw with the Summer of Love, Molotov-throwing cocktail lawyers and the other insurrection
[00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:12.069]  or January 6 event, which was to interfere with Trump's inauguration in 2017, virtually
[00:41:12.069 --> 00:41:16.430]  all of the people who protested rioted burnt cars.
[00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:17.830]  No consequences whatsoever.
[00:41:17.830 --> 00:41:18.830]  No.
[00:41:18.830 --> 00:41:21.630]  And in fact, you know, you bring that up and I think that's the right word here.
[00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:22.630]  These are political prisoners.
[00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:26.950]  But I was there at Trump's inauguration in January of 2017.
[00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:28.630]  I watched I filmed it.
[00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:34.310]  I watched the the left intentionally blockade the entrances so people couldn't get in.
[00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:38.670]  I watched them smash windows in downtown D.C. just random businesses.
[00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:41.270]  They just walk by a window, smash it with a hammer.
[00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:44.670]  They'd smash random cars, throw Molotov cocktails into cars.
[00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:49.029]  There were multiple times me and my crew would just be standing on the street somewhere, either
[00:41:49.029 --> 00:41:51.190]  moving to another location or waiting to film.
[00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:56.950]  And then just like 20 feet from us, boom, massive explosion, firework goes right off.
[00:41:56.950 --> 00:42:02.310]  And like you said, there was no massive push to punish these groups that were clearly coordinated
[00:42:02.310 --> 00:42:03.310]  on that day.
[00:42:03.310 --> 00:42:04.910]  I mean, just look at this comparison.
[00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:09.190]  Rochester man given one hundred and eighty days in jail for raping two girls age four
[00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:13.430]  and nine hundred and eighty days in jail for nine year old girls he raped.
[00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:14.950]  But Oath Keepers gets 18 years.
[00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:17.910]  I mean, we could we could do this forever.
[00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:22.990]  In the 30 seconds till the break, though, I mean, what kind of messaging do you try
[00:42:22.990 --> 00:42:28.910]  to use on your podcast to get people to understand truly how dire this is?
[00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:31.910]  People need to understand that the conspiracies are true.
[00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:38.910]  I mean, what what people made fun of, what people made fun of Alex Jones for a decade
[00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:40.510]  ago is true.
[00:42:40.510 --> 00:42:44.630]  And now you're seeing it in real time, that it's an outright weaponization of the political
[00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:49.510]  system, not for law enforcement and not for justice, but for political retribution, to
[00:42:49.510 --> 00:42:55.069]  silence political adversaries and to scare people who might dare speak up into total
[00:42:55.069 --> 00:42:58.430]  silence when they're sentencing meme makers to jail.
[00:42:58.430 --> 00:43:02.550]  You know, no one is sold out for more than a year.
[00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:07.750]  We now have back in stock a limited run of our extremely popular tooth whitening coral
[00:43:07.750 --> 00:43:13.710]  calcium toothpaste full of essential oils back in stock and in full or store dot com.

[00:44:00.029 --> 00:44:04.830]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mug shot because
[00:44:04.830 --> 00:44:06.270]  they knew that that would help Trump.
[00:44:06.270 --> 00:44:08.630]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:10.109]  We were waiting for the mug shot.
[00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:11.350]  We learned today they wouldn't have it.
[00:44:11.350 --> 00:44:17.670]  So we've made our own and it says political prisoner with an image of President Trump.
[00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:20.109]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[00:44:20.109 --> 00:44:22.670]  It will be shipping out to you in one week.
[00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:28.870]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front there in a mug shot jail background.
[00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:29.870]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[00:44:29.870 --> 00:44:34.029]  It says InfoWareStore.com on the back of the shirt.
[00:44:34.029 --> 00:44:35.270]  We also have Alex Jones for president.
[00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:36.670]  No, I'm not running for president.
[00:44:36.670 --> 00:44:39.870]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt, red, white and blue.
[00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:41.790]  Alex Jones for president 24.
[00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:44.350]  It's a fun conversational piece and a limited edition shirt.
[00:44:44.350 --> 00:44:46.230]  Great way to fund the operation.

[00:45:23.310 --> 00:45:24.310]  I don't know.
[00:45:24.310 --> 00:45:27.550]  Alex and I are telling you how late it is before midnight strikes.
[00:45:27.550 --> 00:45:32.230]  And again, magnesium is critical for your muscles and everything.
[00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:33.230]  Krill oil.
[00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:39.310]  What I'm watching right before my eyes is a composite overview of nutritional supplements
[00:45:39.310 --> 00:45:40.910]  that will keep you alive.
[00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:44.870]  And I would urge everyone, maybe you don't take vitamins, maybe you don't take nutritional
[00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:47.230]  supplements, but the day will come.
[00:45:47.230 --> 00:45:51.230]  Vitamin C and zinc absolutely imperative for the cold DNA force.
[00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:52.230]  Absolutely imperative.
[00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:53.230]  Mineral fusion.
[00:45:53.230 --> 00:45:54.230]  Absolutely.
[00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:57.069]  As you're drinking filtered water, a lot of it will become demineralized.
[00:45:57.069 --> 00:46:00.029]  You have to have these products.
[00:46:00.029 --> 00:46:04.830]  TurboForce is back, sold out for eight months, and it's TurboForce Plus.
[00:46:04.830 --> 00:46:06.990]  We made it even stronger.
[00:46:06.990 --> 00:46:12.550]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere, TurboForce is back in stock
[00:46:12.550 --> 00:46:17.630]  at InfoWareStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:23.670]  It's not just wide spectrum natural herbs that time release over 10 hours.
[00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:25.790]  It should be called 10 hour energy.
[00:46:25.790 --> 00:46:31.270]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids
[00:46:31.270 --> 00:46:36.430]  that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name
[00:46:36.430 --> 00:46:37.430]  it.
[00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:41.230]  It is the super fuel.
[00:46:41.230 --> 00:46:42.670]  RainForce Plus is great.
[00:46:42.670 --> 00:46:43.670]  RainForce Alt is great.
[00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:44.670]  They're two different nootropics.
[00:46:44.670 --> 00:46:45.670]  They go good with this.
[00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:48.190]  But this is the King Kong.
[00:46:48.190 --> 00:46:49.830]  This is the boss.
[00:46:49.830 --> 00:47:01.430]  TurboForce back in stock, discounted, InfoWareStore.com, more power, more strength, more energy.
[00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:07.630]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:09.110 --> 00:47:29.510]  Oh boy, the final countdown. You know, I will be in court next week, or excuse me, next
[00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:35.830]  month rather. You keep seeing these cases and these results roll out, folks. Here's
[00:47:35.830 --> 00:47:41.350]  another one. Jessica Watkins, Oath Keepers member and Army veteran sentenced to eight
[00:47:41.350 --> 00:47:48.750]  and a half years in prison for role in January 6th. I don't know, Viva. I guess our biggest
[00:47:48.750 --> 00:47:53.190]  mistake here, I guess the biggest mistake for these individuals was they should have
[00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:58.230]  joined Black Lives Matter and burned and looted a target. They should have joined Antifa and
[00:47:58.230 --> 00:48:02.190]  just done random violence and destruction throughout the streets of D.C., maybe thrown
[00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:08.190]  a couple of Molotov cocktails into police vehicles. I mean, what's so frustrating about
[00:48:08.190 --> 00:48:12.470]  this is how cut and dry the double standard is. What's so frustrating about this is just
[00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:17.670]  how obvious the two-tiered system of justice here is. Like, do they really think they're
[00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:21.830]  fooling anybody with this? Are they? What do you think?
[00:48:21.830 --> 00:48:26.550]  They are able to fool those who are open and willing to be fooled. I mean, there are some
[00:48:26.550 --> 00:48:30.590]  people who just need the justification for their already held beliefs. And so they see
[00:48:30.590 --> 00:48:35.910]  these sentences not as a political injustice, an outrage. They see it as reaffirming what
[00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:41.630]  they already believed. January 6th was on par with 9-11 and Pearl Harbor. I mean, when you
[00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:46.790]  have this this political indoctrination coming from the highest up, Kamala Harris saying,
[00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:52.550]  you know, certain days will live in infamy. It was Pearl Harbor, 9-11, January 6th. And
[00:48:52.550 --> 00:48:56.170]  people believe it. And then despite all evidence, they believe it. And now they've got the convictions
[00:48:56.170 --> 00:49:01.050]  that will allow them to reaffirm that wrongly held belief in the first place. It's almost
[00:49:01.050 --> 00:49:06.530]  like some form of brainwashing, which we know that which we know there have been projects
[00:49:06.530 --> 00:49:11.010]  of. But it's brainwashing at a mass scale where you have the government working in tandem
[00:49:11.010 --> 00:49:14.010]  with the media to make sure that it's all the people here.
[00:49:14.010 --> 00:49:19.810]  But these sentences are an absolute outrage. And the headlines that tried to spin them
[00:49:19.810 --> 00:49:25.650]  to make them seem like less of an outrage are like Orwellian Babylon B-level madness.
[00:49:25.650 --> 00:49:32.650]  I think it was an NBC article that said Rhodes' main regret was having not brought firearms
[00:49:32.650 --> 00:49:36.810]  to the to January 6th. Like, oh, because the day after or a week later, he said, I wish
[00:49:36.810 --> 00:49:40.410]  I had brought some rifles that would have been over then and there. How do you have
[00:49:40.410 --> 00:49:46.130]  seditious conspiracy to overthrow the government and think that you can convict someone of that
[00:49:46.130 --> 00:49:50.370]  where they didn't even bring firearms that they had and that, you know, that's how you're
[00:49:50.370 --> 00:49:53.090]  going to do it if that's what you're going to do that.
[00:49:53.090 --> 00:49:59.410]  And you have you have, you know, intelligence, FBI informants infiltrating these groups months
[00:49:59.410 --> 00:50:05.330]  in advance, months in advance for both the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys. And yet somehow
[00:50:05.330 --> 00:50:09.370]  they say we didn't know what was going to happen on January 6th. And yet it happened
[00:50:09.370 --> 00:50:13.410]  because we were understaffed because of covid half as many police officers protecting the
[00:50:13.410 --> 00:50:18.450]  capital that there should have been informants and agents knowing of these plots for months
[00:50:18.450 --> 00:50:19.450]  on end.
[00:50:19.450 --> 00:50:24.010]  And somehow nobody can do anything. And it happens. What happens is, you know, bad, but
[00:50:24.010 --> 00:50:29.570]  not 9-11 bad. And anybody who makes that comparison has lost their mind or their soul or both.
[00:50:29.570 --> 00:50:33.850]  And it happens. And what a political convenience it happens. It gets two years of investigations.
[00:50:33.850 --> 00:50:38.410]  And now you've got the convictions to ratify and legitimize the two years of bogus kangaroo
[00:50:38.410 --> 00:50:42.390]  committee investigations run by the bipartisan Kinzinger and Liz Cheney.
[00:50:42.390 --> 00:50:46.970]  It's all a joke and people don't understand it or they are unwilling to understand it.
[00:50:46.970 --> 00:50:53.050]  And my attempt is to make people understand it or in this passive. Yeah, sorry.
[00:50:53.050 --> 00:50:58.170]  Well, this might, you know, some some legal minds might think this is a good tactic from
[00:50:58.170 --> 00:51:03.090]  the bench. Others may disagree and think it is bad for the legal system. But there's no
[00:51:03.090 --> 00:51:08.570]  doubt it happens. I mean, hell, it's happened to me when I was a younger man where a judge
[00:51:08.570 --> 00:51:15.730]  will use a case to make an example to hopefully deter others from engaging in similar activity.
[00:51:16.450 --> 00:51:23.170]  And so maybe that's a little bit of what's going on here. But again, I can't buy that.
[00:51:23.170 --> 00:51:28.450]  I can't buy that because we watched in America. You watched in Canada. We watched in the year
[00:51:28.450 --> 00:51:33.250]  2020. Let's just use the one year alone in 2020, the summer of 2020, the George Floyd
[00:51:33.250 --> 00:51:39.130]  riots, 175 targets had to be shut down because of violence. Two billion dollars, more than
[00:51:39.130 --> 00:51:43.670]  two billion dollars, the highest ever when it comes to insurance claims in property damage
[00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:49.430]  in the summer of 2020. So it's not like you have people from the bench trying to make
[00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:54.230]  a statement and deter future activity here, using cases as an example to try to deter
[00:51:54.230 --> 00:52:01.470]  future activity, if anything. The example was, OK, if you engage in violence as a group
[00:52:01.470 --> 00:52:06.030]  that's political, we're going to allow it. We're going to turn the other way and we're
[00:52:06.030 --> 00:52:10.170]  going to give you a light sentence. That's what we saw all of 2020 with BLM and Antifa.
[00:52:10.170 --> 00:52:15.930]  So it's almost like if you if you were in that mindset on January 6th, you thought,
[00:52:15.930 --> 00:52:19.890]  hey, I watched Black Lives Matter and Antifa engaging in all of this violence. If I just
[00:52:19.890 --> 00:52:25.410]  show up and walk around not doing any violence, I should be OK.
[00:52:25.410 --> 00:52:29.410]  You forgot one important thing also above and beyond the two billion dollars in damage.
[00:52:29.410 --> 00:52:35.290]  Dozens of people killed. Yes. And and actually killed, not like wrongly attributed to fire
[00:52:35.290 --> 00:52:38.890]  extinguishers to the head. And it turns out to be natural causes. And you still have politicians
[00:52:38.890 --> 00:52:45.650]  repeating that egregious, shameful lie. Dozens. Whereas January 6, who was killed? Ashley
[00:52:45.650 --> 00:52:48.610]  Babbitt shot point blank by the Capitol Police guy.
[00:52:48.610 --> 00:52:52.810]  I don't need to mention his name. Roseanne Boyland, who might have been beaten to death
[00:52:52.810 --> 00:52:57.690]  by the police or knocked over and trampled to death. And then Brian Sicknick, who everyone
[00:52:57.690 --> 00:53:04.690]  said was killed by a group of Trump mob supporters when he allegedly, by all accounts and officially
[00:53:04.690 --> 00:53:07.530]  died of a stroke and was never bludgeoned with any fire extinguisher.
[00:53:07.850 --> 00:53:12.330]  They fabricate the deaths on the one side or at least appropriate the deaths that they
[00:53:12.330 --> 00:53:16.210]  caused to be used against the people that they caused it against and then ignore it
[00:53:16.210 --> 00:53:21.330]  in the other case. Whether or not that's a decent point, maybe they thought, you know,
[00:53:21.330 --> 00:53:24.330]  so long as we don't do anything bad, it will be cool because they didn't go after the people
[00:53:24.330 --> 00:53:29.330]  who burnt down cities. OK, you know, some would say the judge is trying to make an example
[00:53:29.330 --> 00:53:30.330]  of it.
[00:53:30.330 --> 00:53:34.690]  Some could get even more cynical and say the judge is trying to provoke the very reaction
[00:53:34.690 --> 00:53:39.490]  that they are purporting to punish right now with these outlandish, absolutely unjust
[00:53:39.490 --> 00:53:44.130]  sentences, excessive unjust sentences. Do this and then try to provoke an even bigger
[00:53:44.130 --> 00:53:48.810]  reaction so that you can come down even harder. You know, it's not an accident that Justin
[00:53:48.810 --> 00:53:55.210]  Trudeau, Joe Biden, you know, is talking about this radical white nationalism, white right
[00:53:55.210 --> 00:53:58.390]  wing extremism being the greatest threat to America.
[00:53:58.390 --> 00:54:03.190]  And most people who know don't agree with him. But my goodness, you know, if you can't
[00:54:03.190 --> 00:54:06.870]  find the extremists, you can certainly try to provoke them or create them by handing
[00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:12.110]  down absolutely ludicrous sentences where people start to say this is outrageous.
[00:54:12.110 --> 00:54:15.670]  And then you sort of build the extremists that you purport to be fighting.
[00:54:15.670 --> 00:54:21.750]  Now, these aren't isolated incidents that we have in the justice system here. It's it's
[00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:28.550]  very prevalent. It's very overwhelming. Is there any sort of historical case or precedent
[00:54:28.550 --> 00:54:35.910]  or action, let's say, that's been done to try to stop the politicization of the justice
[00:54:35.910 --> 00:54:43.310]  system in throughout world history? Has there ever been such a case of of clear cut?
[00:54:43.310 --> 00:54:48.350]  Like you said earlier, I completely agree. Activism from the bench. What is the response
[00:54:48.350 --> 00:54:53.610]  to this? What what what can the American people do to try to right this?
[00:54:53.610 --> 00:54:57.870]  This is where, you know, the difficulty becomes looking for the white pill and not the black
[00:54:57.870 --> 00:55:02.630]  pill or the doom pill, as they call it. You know, you have committees that go and they
[00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:06.470]  have their you know, they have their hearings and they discover all sorts of wild information
[00:55:06.470 --> 00:55:10.510]  that 90 percent of the population are not watching anyhow, because people have to live
[00:55:10.510 --> 00:55:14.850]  their lives and, you know, fight for their own survival economically and whatever.
[00:55:14.850 --> 00:55:17.590]  And then the 10 percent that watch it, you know, it fizzles out. Collective memory is
[00:55:17.590 --> 00:55:25.190]  very short. The solution is bottom up, top down. You know, the populist movement of making
[00:55:25.190 --> 00:55:30.590]  people aware, democratizing information and making people aware of the historical atrocities
[00:55:30.590 --> 00:55:34.110]  that the government has committed and how they might, you know, be doing something
[00:55:34.110 --> 00:55:38.630]  similar in real time. And once you can get people to understand this, I was on with Jimmy
[00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:42.190]  Dore and he said, look, you don't have to wake the sheep.
[00:55:42.190 --> 00:55:45.670]  You just have to gather the lions. A lot of people say you don't need to wake everybody
[00:55:45.670 --> 00:55:49.670]  up, but you just need to wake enough people up or at least gather enough people to start
[00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:54.590]  talking and sensitize people to what's going on. That that is the way it has to go.
[00:55:54.590 --> 00:56:00.150]  But what is not the answer is violence for the reasons that we've seen for January six
[00:56:00.150 --> 00:56:05.190]  for the Ottawa protests. If there's violence, the government and it's the politically right
[00:56:05.190 --> 00:56:09.270]  type of violence, the right type. The government will weaponize it to go after its own citizens
[00:56:09.270 --> 00:56:14.310]  and use every tool it has available. I mean, they went after every single person that was
[00:56:14.310 --> 00:56:18.110]  at January six. They still don't know who leaked the the Dobbs opinion from the Supreme
[00:56:18.110 --> 00:56:19.110]  Court hogwash.
[00:56:19.110 --> 00:56:24.750]  Yeah, they won't even tell you who the pipe bomber was. Oh, they that that that story
[00:56:24.750 --> 00:56:30.030]  about the pipe bombs on Jan six or Jan fifth. That also slipped under the rug. They can't
[00:56:30.030 --> 00:56:35.110]  find Q, you know, and 18 years for Rhodes. Ray Epps, he's a poor schmuck that everyone
[00:56:35.110 --> 00:56:38.270]  has to feel bad about. And it's a conspiracy theory to suggest that he might have done
[00:56:38.270 --> 00:56:42.710]  exactly what we saw he did on camera. But the issue is, even when there's not the violence
[00:56:42.710 --> 00:56:44.830]  that the government then weaponizes, they don't need it.
[00:56:44.830 --> 00:56:48.550]  You can look up in Canada. There could be the most peaceful protests on earth and they
[00:56:48.550 --> 00:56:53.870]  will just fabricate the violence. They'll fabricate the extremism out of thin air, whole
[00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:59.030]  cloth, just make it up, get their media to run the nonsense. And enough people will be,
[00:56:59.030 --> 00:57:04.070]  you know, be convinced by the propaganda. But the way to change things, it's not going
[00:57:04.070 --> 00:57:07.710]  to be through violence, because the government kind of actually wants that. I say Justin
[00:57:07.710 --> 00:57:10.430]  Trudeau wanted nothing more than a January six in Ottawa.
[00:57:10.430 --> 00:57:15.830]  He didn't get it. He still did what he wanted to do. It has to be bottom up, top down a
[00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:20.590]  populist movement where politicians at the at the top start understanding nobody's going
[00:57:20.590 --> 00:57:23.950]  to put up with this anymore politically. And then it becomes cool politically to put an
[00:57:23.950 --> 00:57:24.950]  end to it.
[00:57:24.950 --> 00:57:31.830]  Viva Fry, Viva Barnes Law dot locals dot com and your great podcast on Rumble as well.
[00:57:31.830 --> 00:57:34.230]  Thank you for joining us so much today.
[00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:35.470]  Thank you for having me. It was great.
[00:57:35.470 --> 00:57:39.630]  All right. You have a great weekend up there in Canada. All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:57:39.630 --> 00:57:44.470]  we now go into the second hour of the Alex Jones show. Don't go anywhere.
[00:57:48.510 --> 00:57:51.510]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[00:57:51.510 --> 00:57:54.510]  Please write this down and please go look this up.
[00:57:54.510 --> 00:57:56.510]  It will change your life.
[00:57:56.510 --> 00:57:59.510]  The UN admits and the Lansing Medical Journal admits
[00:57:59.510 --> 00:58:02.510]  that upwards of 2 billion people have mental disabilities
[00:58:02.510 --> 00:58:05.510]  and declining cognitive abilities.
[00:58:05.510 --> 00:58:10.510]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[00:58:10.510 --> 00:58:15.510]  Most iodine in the environment is bound to other elements so your body can't absorb it.
[00:58:15.510 --> 00:58:20.510]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[00:58:20.510 --> 00:58:27.510]  And Infowarsstore.com has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of full effect.
[00:58:27.510 --> 00:58:30.510]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3 has been sold out for six months.
[00:58:30.510 --> 00:58:33.510]  It's very hard to produce and it's finally back in stock.
[00:58:33.510 --> 00:58:36.510]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[00:58:36.510 --> 00:58:38.510]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is powerful.
[00:58:38.510 --> 00:58:40.510]  You and your family need it.
[00:58:40.510 --> 00:58:42.510]  It's 25% off, back in stock.
[00:58:42.510 --> 00:58:46.510]  X3, try iodine exclusively at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:58:46.510 --> 00:58:49.510]  Take action now, but regardless, research is info.
[00:58:49.510 --> 00:58:56.510]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire food supply.
[00:58:56.510 --> 00:59:01.510]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element,
[00:59:01.510 --> 00:59:05.510]  which has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[00:59:05.510 --> 00:59:08.510]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[00:59:08.510 --> 00:59:11.510]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[00:59:11.510 --> 00:59:16.510]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics
[00:59:16.510 --> 00:59:20.510]  that will naturally keep the soil rich with iodine.
[00:59:20.510 --> 00:59:25.510]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day.
[00:59:25.510 --> 00:59:30.510]  Derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the earth's surface,
[00:59:30.510 --> 00:59:36.510]  our Infowars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[00:59:36.510 --> 00:59:42.510]  Pure, nascent iodine, stabilized in an activated triiodine form.
[00:59:42.510 --> 00:59:49.510]  For a healthy thyroid and a healthy metabolism, get yours now at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:59:51.510 --> 00:59:57.510]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:59:58.740 --> 01:00:20.299]  Well, the same people that are politically persecuting you are also trying to disarm
[01:00:20.299 --> 01:00:21.299]  you.
[01:00:21.299 --> 01:00:22.620]  That's how a slave gets treated.
[01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:25.180]  Get the picture?
[01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:31.339]  So O'Keefe Media Group finds special assistant to John Fetterman in an open moment admitting
[01:00:31.339 --> 01:00:35.740]  that yes, the Democrats are planning to overturn the Second Amendment.
[01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:37.979]  Here it is in clip five.
[01:00:37.979 --> 01:00:43.060]  He probably you'd be okay with like overturning the Second Amendment.
[01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:48.700]  I think he'd much rather prefer like nobody has done.
[01:00:48.700 --> 01:00:55.600]  What you're so exclusive with doing interviews too, it's like the ones you pick will say
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:56.600]  exactly what you're saying, you know?
[01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:57.600]  It's so interesting, but I wouldn't know who they are because I'll listen to those people.
[01:00:57.600 --> 01:00:58.600]  There's like puppets though of big reporters who are like, they aren't like them, but
[01:00:58.600 --> 01:00:59.600]  they're real people, you know.
[01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:00.600]  Who we know will paint the narrative the way we want.
[01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:01.600]  So that's why you pick the journalist that you pick, they'll say whatever you want them
[01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:02.600]  to.
[01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:03.600]  Yeah, yeah, pretty much.
[01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:04.600]  Like they won't say nothing in a bad light, you know?
[01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:22.839]  Well, we'd like to introduce you to special assistant Luke Warwicken, who told us, quote,
[01:01:22.839 --> 01:01:24.640]  everyone wants a story on Fetterman.
[01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:37.120]  Well, leave it to the O'Keefe Media Group to bring you that story.
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:52.120]  That's like, if you have, I mean, like, they also realize is that, that, that now.
[01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:58.560]  James O'Keefe with OMG here in our nation's Capitol to report on a story involving U.S.
[01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:00.439]  Senator John Fetterman.
[01:02:00.439 --> 01:02:05.240]  Associates, colleagues, constituents have long been fascinated with Fetterman's mental and
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:07.879]  cognitive issues.
[01:02:07.879 --> 01:02:09.439]  Everyone wants a story on John Fetterman.
[01:02:09.439 --> 01:02:15.879]  Well, we'd like to introduce you to special assistant Luke Warwicken, who told us, quote,
[01:02:15.879 --> 01:02:18.160]  everyone wants a story on Fetterman.
[01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:23.919]  Well, leave it to the O'Keefe Media Group to bring you that story.
[01:02:23.919 --> 01:02:24.919]  My job is like to be like the in-between between him and the rest of the staff.
[01:02:24.919 --> 01:02:25.919]  I have like a, an iPad I carry around, which like live transcribes everything everyone's
[01:02:25.919 --> 01:02:26.919]  saying.
[01:02:26.919 --> 01:02:27.919]  But sometimes it misses stuff or like it'll just cut out, um, based on like, you know,
[01:02:27.919 --> 01:02:28.919]  self-service and shit.
[01:02:28.919 --> 01:02:29.919]  My job is to hook you up out there so like you can pick up on everything they're saying.
[01:02:29.919 --> 01:02:55.720]  And like, that's not my job, but like, you know, there's so many reporters and like the
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:03:24.720]  reporters, um, they don't want, we don't, we shouldn't just be telling them to fuck
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:25.720]  off.
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:26.720]  We should be telling them about John Fetterman.
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:27.720]  And we only give it to certain people.
[01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:28.720]  And I pick reporters who are like, who we know will paint the narrative the way we want.
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:29.720]  So it's like when John checks himself up for deportion, we tell one reporter, um, in particular
[01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:30.720]  because like they will hit the facts that we don't want them to.
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:31.720]  It's like we pick reporters who like, we know will give us like a good treatment.
[01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:32.720]  They're desperate for an interview with John.
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:33.720]  I mean, like, doesn't mean they're bad reporters, but like, if you want to access journalism
[01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:34.720]  is.
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:35.720]  No.
[01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:36.720]  No.
[01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:37.720]  No.
[01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:38.720]  No.
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:39.720]  No.
[01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:40.720]  No.
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:41.720]  No.
[01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:42.720]  No.
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:43.720]  No.
[01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:44.720]  No.
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:45.720]  No.
[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:46.720]  No.
[01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:47.720]  No.
[01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:48.720]  No.
[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:49.720]  No.
[01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:50.720]  No.
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:51.720]  No.
[01:05:51.720 --> 01:06:04.000]  We basically tell whatever the story wants as long as they get the interview.
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:10.379]  Like there's certain like Trump journalists who are accused of that because like everybody
[01:06:10.379 --> 01:06:11.379]  wants an interview with the guy.
[01:06:11.379 --> 01:06:12.379]  Yeah.
[01:06:12.379 --> 01:06:16.460]  But like as a thing is when you're so exclusive with who you give interviews to.
[01:06:16.460 --> 01:06:20.439]  It's like the ones that like, we'll just say exactly.
[01:06:20.439 --> 01:06:30.200]  All right, we're going to start covering some news here.
[01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:34.960]  I probably will open up the phone lines as well.
[01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:39.080]  We're dealing with the two big monsters in the room here.
[01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:47.359]  The left sexually targeting children with the LGBTQ plus propaganda.
[01:06:47.359 --> 01:06:49.479]  Got more news on that.
[01:06:49.479 --> 01:06:53.160]  And then I got a stack of news dealing with the political corruption here as well.
[01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:59.879]  But let me just pause and take care of some business here really fast, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:06:59.879 --> 01:07:03.640]  and ask the audience a favor.
[01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:05.640]  Alex Jones has been off this week.
[01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:10.919]  It's always an honor and a privilege to fill in for Alex here hosting the show.
[01:07:10.919 --> 01:07:16.019]  Problem is when Alex is away, the funding that normally comes in goes down.
[01:07:16.019 --> 01:07:18.680]  So do me a favor on this Friday.
[01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:24.359]  Make your way over to infowarsstore.com and make a small donation to us so that we can
[01:07:24.359 --> 01:07:25.540]  stay on air.
[01:07:25.540 --> 01:07:31.460]  And Alex doesn't have to be worrying about funding while he is taking a much needed break.
[01:07:31.460 --> 01:07:37.080]  So infowarsstore.com, you can go hit that donate tab, $5, $10, whatever you can give
[01:07:37.080 --> 01:07:39.040]  us today is greatly appreciated.
[01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:44.960]  Now if you want to get one of our great products, Survival Shield X3, this is a no brainer.
[01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:50.500]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's well known that a lot of people, if not the majority of people,
[01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:52.200]  are deficient in iodine.
[01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:54.819]  It's just not in the diet and they're just not getting it.
[01:07:54.819 --> 01:08:01.019]  And so we have the solution and that's Survival Shield X3 nascent triiodine at infowarsstore.com.

[01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:41.840]  Survival Shield X3, the formula was manufactured in a state licensed facility using powerful

[01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:02.519]  old nascent iodine system.
[01:09:02.519 --> 01:09:10.519]  Now's the time folks, get to infowarsstore.com, secure Survival Shield X3 for 25% off while
[01:09:10.519 --> 01:09:18.160]  supplies last, and of course it is your support there that keeps us on the air, and we are
[01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:21.680]  thankful for that.
[01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:26.000]  Now then, let me, before I really focus on the two big stories, let's pick some other
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:30.000]  news stories up and cover them.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:35.200]  Like did you know, so we're sitting here obsessing over this Pride Month thing, and that's obviously
[01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:38.519]  due to the overwhelming propaganda and nature of it.
[01:09:38.519 --> 01:09:44.880]  But you know, yesterday came and went, and you may have not heard, as I'm even a day
[01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:53.120]  late myself, that yesterday, May 25th, is National Missing Children's Day.
[01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:56.360]  National Missing Children's Day.
[01:09:56.360 --> 01:10:01.080]  And I think it's even more imperative that we remember this, considering the amount of
[01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:06.519]  children that are going missing now at the southern border every day.
[01:10:06.519 --> 01:10:13.840]  And it's even more disgusting because we realize the Biden administration is facilitating this
[01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:21.599]  process of the human trafficking, specifically of children, by not doing the DNA testing.
[01:10:21.599 --> 01:10:30.040]  So look, you would think there'd be an issue that wouldn't be polarized, you would think
[01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:36.320]  there'd be an issue that wouldn't be political, that everybody would agree on, and that would
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:42.120]  be stopping children from getting trafficked, stopping children from getting kidnapped,
[01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:46.680]  stopping children from going missing.
[01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:52.639]  And yet here we are, the Biden administration is doing everything to make sure those situations
[01:10:52.639 --> 01:10:56.080]  at the southern border continue.
[01:10:56.080 --> 01:11:03.360]  They are not doing DNA testing when children come across the border.
[01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:09.599]  It's also well known, specifically to the coyotes, if you bring a minor across the
[01:11:09.599 --> 01:11:15.240]  border with you, many times, if not all times, that's basically a free pass.
[01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:22.040]  And so the coyotes and the human traffickers use children to bring people across the border
[01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:26.559]  and get them in, and now they don't even do the DNA testing.
[01:11:26.559 --> 01:11:33.680]  So any guy, gal, what have you, can take a minor across the border and say, oh, that's
[01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:37.840]  my daughter, that's my niece, that's my nephew, what have you, and they get a free entry,
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:41.320]  and they don't even do the DNA testing to make sure that's the case.
[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:43.400]  A totally dangerous situation.
[01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:51.960]  A lot of these children just end up becoming mules, essentially, a mule metro pass, and
[01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:56.639]  they just get passed back and forth over the border being used for illegal border crossings.
[01:11:56.639 --> 01:11:57.799]  Many of them die.
[01:11:57.799 --> 01:12:00.320]  Many of them get dropped from the 30-foot wall.
[01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:03.120]  All of this has been well-documented.
[01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:04.120]  All of this has been well-documented.
[01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:12.160]  In fact, they even had to admit 80,000 children have gone missing because of the open southern
[01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:19.320]  border phenomenon, 80,000 children, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:25.200]  If just 1% of those children end up in a trafficking situation, that should break every person's
[01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:29.400]  heart on this planet.
[01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:33.840]  And yet, we don't even think about it, we don't even make a big deal of it, we barely
[01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:39.599]  even talk about it, I'm guilty of it as well, I'm not above this criticism, and we sit here
[01:12:39.599 --> 01:12:46.480]  and talk about Pride Month, and we sit here and have to deal with the sexual propaganda
[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:54.000]  aimed at children, instead of on the one day, the one day, where we at least should
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:13:00.760]  pretend to care about all the children being trafficked, we just completely skip over it
[01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:03.960]  and ignore it, and it's not even a big national story.
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:08.200]  It's really sad.
[01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:13.519]  And I will tell you, this also ties into the situation in Ukraine, because that vassal state,
[01:13:13.559 --> 01:13:22.599]  that CIA, Western-backed vassal state is a major trafficking hub, specifically with children.
[01:13:22.599 --> 01:13:30.360]  And in fact, I talk to individuals, some publicly, some privately, that work in the field of saving
[01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:37.880]  children from sex trafficking, or going after child abusers and pedophiles, and they say
[01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:46.559]  a lot of the disgusting stuff that you find on the internet, involving children, comes
[01:13:46.559 --> 01:13:49.480]  out of Ukraine.
[01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:53.480]  Now, you think about that.
[01:13:53.480 --> 01:14:00.760]  You think about two of the major problem areas in the world, when it comes to child abuse
[01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:06.440]  and child sex trafficking, the United States southern border and Ukraine, and it's got
[01:14:06.519 --> 01:14:16.280]  the Biden family fingerprints all over it.
[01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:22.000]  You know, maybe we should just do, you know, I don't know if we can actually do this because
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:29.200]  we have automated stuff that kicks in for radio silence here, but maybe we should do
[01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:33.240]  a moment of silence.
[01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:35.280]  Maybe we should do a moment of silence.
[01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:37.120]  I can't even fathom, folks.
[01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:38.120]  Your heart breaks.
[01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:41.080]  I mean, I look at my situation, I look at what I might be going through, I look at maybe
[01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:45.960]  they try to put me in jail the rest of my life or destroy me or kill me.
[01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:50.719]  All of those fates for Owen Schroer would be better than any child that ends up in the
[01:14:50.719 --> 01:14:59.599]  arms of a trafficker.
[01:14:59.599 --> 01:15:05.200]  So I think just pull the music down to break, guys.
[01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:08.599]  I don't want any music going to break.
[01:15:08.599 --> 01:15:14.240]  We need to ground ourselves on this issue, folks.
[01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:24.000]  The Lord God hears the cries of those innocent children and asks, why are we letting this
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.760]  happen?
[01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:34.519]  So in honor of National Missing Children's Day here on the Alex Jones Show, I want to
[01:15:34.519 --> 01:15:38.519]  go to this break with a moment of silence.
[01:15:38.519 --> 01:15:44.120]  And just for this 10 seconds to break, just give your heart to them, pray for them, pray
[01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:59.360]  God's protection over them and that somehow, someway we can save them.
[01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:04.599]  Sold out for more than a year, we now have back in stock a limited run of our extremely
[01:16:04.599 --> 01:16:10.880]  popular tooth whitening coral calcium toothpaste, full of essential oils, back in stock and

[01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:03.599]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move against Tucker
[01:17:03.599 --> 01:17:05.280]  Carlson and take him off the air.
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:07.680]  People said no way he's the most powerful that ever happened.
[01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:09.599]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[01:17:09.599 --> 01:17:12.639]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believe they can control him.
[01:17:12.639 --> 01:17:15.840]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:20.799]  It's the same thing with Infowars, but Infowars is not owned by Fox or controlled by George
[01:17:20.799 --> 01:17:24.200]  Soros or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:28.000]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.

[01:17:41.799 --> 01:17:44.160]  Please don't take Infowars for granted.

[01:19:08.340 --> 01:19:09.340]  That is a hellish future.
[01:19:09.340 --> 01:19:13.320]  Now, you'll be always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:17.280]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores,
[01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:19.240]  Amazon or Infowars.com.
[01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:23.519]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we
[01:19:23.519 --> 01:19:24.799]  got run out.
[01:19:24.799 --> 01:19:27.360]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:32.760]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World, a signed copy, at Infowars.com.
[01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:36.680]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:40.519]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that
[01:19:40.519 --> 01:19:42.200]  you help keep Infowars on the air.
[01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:45.799]  I'm going to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned
[01:19:45.799 --> 01:19:46.799]  copies.
[01:19:46.799 --> 01:19:51.400]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to Infowars.com and get a signed
[01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:55.840]  copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate to the library or give them to the
[01:19:55.840 --> 01:19:56.840]  local school.
[01:19:56.840 --> 01:19:57.840]  This is an Infowar.
[01:19:57.840 --> 01:19:58.840]  I'm counting on you.
[01:19:58.840 --> 01:19:59.840]  And thank you for your support.
[01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:06.480]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:28.980]  Alright, let's dig into some of this news now.
[01:20:28.980 --> 01:20:33.820]  Target partners with organization pushing for kids' genders to be secretly changed in
[01:20:33.820 --> 01:20:37.179]  schools without parental consent.
[01:20:37.179 --> 01:20:43.940]  We continue to support their mission, Target Corporation said about GLSEN, that's the group.
[01:20:43.940 --> 01:20:53.660]  Now again, how is there, you just can't even believe this exists.
[01:20:53.660 --> 01:20:57.099]  You can't even believe this exists.
[01:20:57.099 --> 01:21:03.620]  Let me try to explain why this is going on to the best of my ability here.
[01:21:03.620 --> 01:21:04.620]  It's very complex.
[01:21:04.620 --> 01:21:07.179]  I'm going to try to sum it up.
[01:21:07.179 --> 01:21:14.860]  American culture, generally speaking, which has been influenced more by the liberal left
[01:21:14.860 --> 01:21:19.019]  than the conservative right in this country for decades.
[01:21:19.019 --> 01:21:26.820]  American culture has become degenerative, immoral filth for the most part.
[01:21:26.820 --> 01:21:33.139]  And so you're just supposed to accept that now, that that's normal.
[01:21:33.139 --> 01:21:43.940]  So now they push it to the next level using the LGBTQ plus pedophile propaganda as their
[01:21:43.940 --> 01:21:52.580]  shield saying you can't say anything negative that is ever labeled LGBTQ plus or you're
[01:21:52.580 --> 01:21:54.959]  a bigot.
[01:21:54.959 --> 01:22:01.540]  So now they promote this idea, this concept, and this is totally Marxist, this is totally
[01:22:01.540 --> 01:22:02.540]  communist.
[01:22:02.540 --> 01:22:10.419]  This concept that you don't have the right to raise your children or that children shouldn't
[01:22:10.419 --> 01:22:17.299]  be protected, whether that's by the government, by the parents, what have you, that minors
[01:22:17.299 --> 01:22:20.120]  don't deserve protection from predators.
[01:22:20.120 --> 01:22:26.139]  And so they use the smoke screen, they use the shield of LGBTQ plus pride to target your
[01:22:26.139 --> 01:22:31.219]  children for abuse because that's exactly what this is.
[01:22:31.900 --> 01:22:40.099]  If some predator convinces your child to chop their arm off, oh hi little boy, my poor
[01:22:40.099 --> 01:22:45.179]  daughter is missing an arm, do you think maybe you could donate yours?
[01:22:45.179 --> 01:22:48.900]  And then they go chop that boy's arm off, well that's a crime.
[01:22:48.900 --> 01:22:53.660]  But oh, when it's LGBTQ plus and it's in the classroom or it's a drag queen and they're
[01:22:53.660 --> 01:22:59.820]  saying, hey, you could be trans too, we'll take you to the doctor, we'll chop your genitals
[01:22:59.820 --> 01:23:00.820]  off.
[01:23:01.419 --> 01:23:03.419]  You won't tell mommy and daddy.
[01:23:03.419 --> 01:23:08.740]  100% of people that hear that should say, nope, that's a predator, that's a crime, you
[01:23:08.740 --> 01:23:09.740]  shouldn't be allowed to do it.
[01:23:09.740 --> 01:23:15.379]  But oh, whoa, whoa, oh, it's LGBTQ pride, well I don't want to touch that then.
[01:23:15.379 --> 01:23:18.339]  I don't want to be considered a bigot.
[01:23:18.339 --> 01:23:23.900]  I don't want that mafia coming after me.
[01:23:23.900 --> 01:23:32.139]  So they degenerate the culture so that you just accept an immoral society.
[01:23:32.139 --> 01:23:42.219]  Then they propagandize and weaponize their abuses aimed at children and they have the
[01:23:42.219 --> 01:23:48.620]  shield of protection that if you dare criticize what they're doing, you'll be called a bigot.
[01:23:48.620 --> 01:23:55.379]  So now you're just like confused, like wait, what just happened here?
[01:23:55.379 --> 01:23:58.940]  Children having sex change surgeries without their parents' permission?
[01:23:58.940 --> 01:24:03.940]  Yes, this is the culture that the left wing has been building towards.
[01:24:03.940 --> 01:24:09.259]  This is the cultural phenomenon that was always going to be at the bottom of this barrel.
[01:24:09.259 --> 01:24:11.700]  You're now here.
[01:24:11.700 --> 01:24:19.259]  The American left believes they have the right to access your children and the American left
[01:24:19.259 --> 01:24:24.879]  will argue that it is the right thing to do to take a child from their parents, perform
[01:24:24.879 --> 01:24:30.820]  a sex change permanently, scarring surgery on them without their parents' permission.
[01:24:30.820 --> 01:24:34.379]  Any other circumstance, any other situation, that's criminal, everybody involved would
[01:24:34.379 --> 01:24:35.379]  go to jail.
[01:24:35.379 --> 01:24:43.339]  But when you have the shield of LGBTQ plus pride, that's how they get away with it.
[01:24:43.339 --> 01:24:50.780]  And you know, I'm not, how should I say this?
[01:24:50.780 --> 01:24:54.900]  I'm perfectly okay with criticism just as much as I'm perfectly okay with giving out
[01:24:54.900 --> 01:24:56.500]  criticism.
[01:24:56.500 --> 01:24:59.259]  So I'd put it like this.
[01:24:59.259 --> 01:25:03.379]  Do you think they're getting away with this in Muslim countries?
[01:25:03.379 --> 01:25:07.059]  No, no, they're not.
[01:25:07.059 --> 01:25:12.099]  Hell, they're not even getting away with this in Russia, which is probably more Christian
[01:25:12.099 --> 01:25:16.780]  now than the United States of America.
[01:25:16.780 --> 01:25:19.459]  I don't think they do this in Israel, do they?
[01:25:19.459 --> 01:25:22.500]  Do they do the genital mutilation in Israel?
[01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:24.379]  I haven't heard about that.
[01:25:24.379 --> 01:25:27.940]  Maybe they do.
[01:25:27.940 --> 01:25:34.419]  But I'm just going to say this, and I think it's a fair criticism, folks.
[01:25:34.419 --> 01:25:42.700]  The American left, the anti-God American left does not give a lick about what Christians
[01:25:42.700 --> 01:25:50.320]  think and they have no fear of any backlash from Christians in America at all.
[01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:55.459]  They're not going to pull this off in Muslim countries, I'll tell you that.
[01:25:55.459 --> 01:26:02.059]  But they'll do it right in front of your face here, and so far the Christian conservative
[01:26:02.059 --> 01:26:05.620]  movement is really just barely responding to this.
[01:26:05.620 --> 01:26:09.200]  And it's not even really being driven from the church.
[01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:19.540]  Now this could change, but I'm just saying, I'm just saying, who's going to stand up to
[01:26:19.540 --> 01:26:20.540]  this?
[01:26:20.540 --> 01:26:21.540]  Who's going to stand up for the children?
[01:26:21.540 --> 01:26:24.540]  Are we going to allow this to continue?
[01:26:24.620 --> 01:26:32.219]  How can it be possible, how can it be possible that you would have children being taken out
[01:26:32.219 --> 01:26:41.019]  of classrooms by teachers and delivered to doctors to have permanent sex change surgeries
[01:26:41.019 --> 01:26:44.740]  and that be okay without any pushback?
[01:26:44.740 --> 01:26:47.580]  How in the hell could that even be possible?
[01:26:47.580 --> 01:26:55.580]  Well you're here now and there has not been a front organized and activated to stop it.
[01:26:55.580 --> 01:27:00.059]  So of course it's going to continue.
[01:27:00.059 --> 01:27:03.139]  So we shall see.
[01:27:03.139 --> 01:27:10.700]  But I'm just saying, because I've had people reach out and say, you know, you've been awfully
[01:27:10.700 --> 01:27:13.980]  critical of Christians in America lately.
[01:27:13.980 --> 01:27:23.580]  Well, okay, I'm critical of the fact that I have to go to the Capitol building and it's
[01:27:23.580 --> 01:27:29.059]  me and maybe five other people pushing back against this trans kid stuff in Texas, and
[01:27:29.059 --> 01:27:33.059]  I don't see any Christian leaders.
[01:27:33.059 --> 01:27:38.059]  I don't see any pastors, I don't see any leaders of congregations, whether they're local here
[01:27:38.059 --> 01:27:43.200]  in Austin or from Dallas or from Houston or from anywhere.
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:47.959]  So I'm sorry if I'm trying to light a fire under the Christian movement in the United
[01:27:47.959 --> 01:27:48.959]  States of America.
[01:27:48.959 --> 01:27:54.719]  And if you're listening to this and you're a Christian and that maybe startles you a
[01:27:54.719 --> 01:27:59.000]  little bit, well, maybe then that's because there's some truth to what I'm saying.
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:03.240]  I don't think this stuff goes on in Muslim countries.
[01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:13.000]  I don't think Islamic leaders would have any tolerance for children being taken out
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.080]  of the classroom and having sex change surgeries.
[01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:16.080]  Could be wrong.
[01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:21.179]  I'm not hearing about that in Muslim, so-called Muslim countries.
[01:28:21.179 --> 01:28:24.320]  But maybe we're not a Christian country anymore.
[01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:25.639]  Maybe that's what it is.
[01:28:25.639 --> 01:28:30.440]  Pride celebration organizers grapple with new Florida laws on drag transgender rights.
[01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:31.440]  Yeah.
[01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:32.440]  Oh, we can't have nude activity.
[01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:38.000]  We can't have lewd activity directed towards children so they don't know what to do.
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:39.000]  It's just ludicrous.
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:40.000]  All right.
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:46.519]  Oh, oh, and Target is more offended at you boycotting them because they target children
[01:28:46.519 --> 01:28:48.000]  with sexual propaganda.
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:53.920]  They're more upset with that than BLM and Antifa burning their stores to the ground.
[01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:59.240]  That's pretty funny.
[01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:03.879]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution is laying right there in front of you, hidden
[01:29:03.879 --> 01:29:05.559]  in plain view.
[01:29:05.559 --> 01:29:08.320]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:12.599]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website where they admit the number
[01:29:12.599 --> 01:29:17.839]  one cause of cognitive disability in the world is iodine deficiency.
[01:29:17.839 --> 01:29:25.120]  The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability is lack of real pure iodine in
[01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:31.440]  the body as they bomb us with the bad halogens, bromine, bromide, chlorine, and so much more.
[01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:37.599]  Upwards of 2 billion people in a Lancet medical journal study in 2007 worldwide have cognitive
[01:29:37.599 --> 01:29:41.519]  disabilities because they don't have high quality iodine.
[01:29:41.519 --> 01:29:43.759]  Most iodine is bound to other elements you're going to absorb it.
[01:29:43.759 --> 01:29:49.280]  We have X3, all three types of the good iodine together that supercharges your body.
[01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:54.039]  X3 is now back in stock at InfoWarsTour.com for being sold out for over six months for
[01:29:54.039 --> 01:29:55.039]  25% off.
[01:29:55.039 --> 01:29:56.799]  X3, back in stock.

[01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:01.719]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[01:30:01.719 --> 01:30:03.799]  Please write this down and please go look this up.
[01:30:03.799 --> 01:30:05.839]  It will change your life.
[01:30:05.839 --> 01:30:10.519]  The UN admits and the Lancet medical journal admits that upwards of 2 billion people have
[01:30:10.519 --> 01:30:14.559]  mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities.
[01:30:14.559 --> 01:30:20.080]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:25.799]  Most iodine in the environment is bound to other elements so your body can't absorb it.
[01:30:25.799 --> 01:30:30.120]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:36.200]  And InfoWarsTour.com has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of full
[01:30:36.200 --> 01:30:37.200]  effect.
[01:30:37.200 --> 01:30:40.219]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3 has been sold out for six months.
[01:30:40.219 --> 01:30:43.160]  It's very hard to produce and it's finally back in stock.
[01:30:43.160 --> 01:30:46.219]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[01:30:46.219 --> 01:30:48.400]  This ladies and gentlemen is powerful.
[01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:49.719]  You and your family need it.
[01:30:49.719 --> 01:30:51.920]  It's 25% off back in stock.
[01:30:51.920 --> 01:30:56.240]  X3 triiodine exclusively at InfoWarsTour.com.
[01:30:56.240 --> 01:30:57.240]  Take action now.
[01:30:57.240 --> 01:30:58.799]  But regardless, research is info.
[01:30:58.799 --> 01:31:05.080]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into
[01:31:05.080 --> 01:31:06.200]  the atmosphere.
[01:31:06.200 --> 01:31:08.920]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[01:31:08.920 --> 01:31:15.360]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers to convert these gases
[01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:17.519]  into fluorosilicic acid.
[01:31:17.519 --> 01:31:19.799]  Still highly toxic, but containable.
[01:31:19.799 --> 01:31:24.580]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison and there was no affordable way to
[01:31:24.580 --> 01:31:25.679]  dispose of it.
[01:31:25.679 --> 01:31:30.599]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the secretary of the treasury who
[01:31:30.599 --> 01:31:34.120]  was responsible for the public health service at the time.
[01:31:34.120 --> 01:31:40.639]  And by 1950, the U.S. government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product
[01:31:40.639 --> 01:31:43.000]  and dumping it into our drinking water.
[01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:48.280]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[01:31:48.280 --> 01:31:54.679]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water and a remedy to this madness.
[01:31:54.679 --> 01:31:58.559]  Available now at InfoWarsTour.com.
[01:31:58.559 --> 01:32:02.280]  I want to thank all of you over the years who have supported InfoWars financially with
[01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:04.240]  word of mouth and prayer.
[01:32:04.240 --> 01:32:07.639]  All the success that we've had together against the globalists and the fact that we're not

[01:32:57.400 --> 01:32:58.400]  Please take action.
[01:32:59.799 --> 01:33:06.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:07.490 --> 01:33:27.490]  You've found it, the tip of the spear, it is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[01:33:27.490 --> 01:33:36.490]  So the pride parades, the leaders, the organizers in Florida don't know what to do because Ron
[01:33:36.490 --> 01:33:41.490]  DeSantis signed the law, you can't do nude or lewd activity at your parades anymore.
[01:33:41.490 --> 01:33:44.490]  So now they're like, well, I don't know what we're going to do then.
[01:33:44.490 --> 01:33:46.490]  That tells you everything.
[01:33:46.490 --> 01:33:47.490]  So does this.
[01:33:47.490 --> 01:33:52.490]  AP called out for claim that target staff were subject to violent confrontations over
[01:33:52.490 --> 01:33:54.490]  trans slash pride products.
[01:33:54.490 --> 01:34:02.490]  Oh, now we did this satirical segment about an hour ago here on The Jones Show that we
[01:34:02.490 --> 01:34:09.490]  showed all the images and videos from the BLM Antifa riots from the summer of 2020,
[01:34:09.490 --> 01:34:15.490]  which were responsible for one hundred and seventy five targets being shut down.
[01:34:15.490 --> 01:34:21.490]  How many targets have had to close because of anti pride for kid protests?
[01:34:21.490 --> 01:34:25.490]  Well, that number is a big fat zero.
[01:34:25.490 --> 01:34:28.490]  That is a big fat zero hundred and seventy five.
[01:34:28.490 --> 01:34:32.490]  So how many targets were closed because of left wing protest?
[01:34:32.490 --> 01:34:34.490]  One hundred and seventy five.
[01:34:34.490 --> 01:34:37.490]  How many targets were closed because of right wing protests?
[01:34:37.490 --> 01:34:39.490]  Zero.
[01:34:39.490 --> 01:34:42.490]  Which side of the aisle is target?
[01:34:42.490 --> 01:34:50.490]  Scolding and attacking today, the side responsible for zero store closures.
[01:34:50.490 --> 01:34:53.490]  Violent confrontations.
[01:34:53.490 --> 01:34:59.490]  Oh, but see what's the what's the logic here that you existing is violent.
[01:34:59.490 --> 01:35:05.490]  Now, look, I. This might be a controversial take, and that's perfectly fine.
[01:35:05.490 --> 01:35:08.490]  We're not stranger to those.
[01:35:08.490 --> 01:35:15.490]  I said earlier this week that in the past, when I saw activities like this at the targets,
[01:35:15.490 --> 01:35:20.490]  I did not endorse it and I did not cover it because I did not agree with it.
[01:35:20.490 --> 01:35:26.490]  And so I always thought it was standoffish and inappropriate and and aggressive.
[01:35:26.490 --> 01:35:29.490]  And that's coming from me.
[01:35:29.490 --> 01:35:35.490]  But we've reached a point now where, again, I'm not going to I'm not going to endorse it.
[01:35:35.490 --> 01:35:38.490]  But I am going to cover it and I am going to say, you know what?
[01:35:38.490 --> 01:35:42.490]  No, you're not going to guilt trip.
[01:35:42.490 --> 01:35:48.490]  Conservatives, you're not going to guilt trip Christians, you're not going to guilt trip.
[01:35:49.490 --> 01:35:52.490]  Individuals that have a problem with pride for kids.
[01:35:52.490 --> 01:36:00.490]  Because you don't like that now individuals are going to your target stores and filming the pride section for kids.
[01:36:00.490 --> 01:36:04.490]  No, you're not going to guilt trip us and make us feel bad like we're the bad guys here.
[01:36:04.490 --> 01:36:12.490]  We're not. We're not the ones that burned and looted targets for an entire summer in 2020 that led to one hundred and seventy five store closures.
[01:36:12.490 --> 01:36:17.490]  So, yeah, you know what? At this point, I will turn my head the other way.
[01:36:17.490 --> 01:36:22.490]  I'm not going to be involved in it. I'm not going to be smashing any pride displays.
[01:36:22.490 --> 01:36:26.490]  I'm not going to be engaging in any violent, criminal or aggressive activity at Target.
[01:36:26.490 --> 01:36:29.490]  I went there. I filmed it. I shot my report.
[01:36:29.490 --> 01:36:33.490]  We even had a little bit of a conversation with the workers. They're fully amicable and friendly.
[01:36:33.490 --> 01:36:37.490]  So that's so so that's going to be my style of dealing with this.
[01:36:37.490 --> 01:36:46.490]  But no, you know what? I think I'm more inclined to show you people that might be getting a little more aggressive and maybe smashing a sign and saying, hey, this is going on to not saying I endorse it to each his own.
[01:36:46.490 --> 01:36:54.490]  But if you think you're going to guilt trip us into not responding to your pride section for kids.
[01:36:54.490 --> 01:37:08.490]  And you think you're going to try to silence us by not calling you out when you did nothing to stop the American left from burning your stores to the ground, looting your stores into closing.
[01:37:08.490 --> 01:37:15.490]  No, no, I'm sorry. I'm not I'm not going to be taking the bait on that.
[01:37:16.490 --> 01:37:21.490]  So, again, I'm not suggesting you do anything aggressive or violent.
[01:37:21.490 --> 01:37:26.490]  I'm not suggesting you go into Target and rip signs up or take clothes down or any of that stuff.
[01:37:26.490 --> 01:37:30.490]  Not suggesting that activity. I'm not endorsing that activity.
[01:37:30.490 --> 01:37:34.490]  I used to not even cover that activity, but I am going to cover it now.
[01:37:35.490 --> 01:37:39.490]  And I am going to point out the irony that, you know what?
[01:37:39.490 --> 01:37:45.490]  While I might not think it's a good idea to go into the Target pride for kids section and smash up the sign.
[01:37:45.490 --> 01:37:50.490]  I'm not going to sit here and say that that's a problem.
[01:37:51.490 --> 01:38:01.490]  When the American left with Black Lives Matter and Antifa were so violent that they had to shut down one hundred and seventy five targets in response.
[01:38:01.490 --> 01:38:12.490]  And then Target's going to come out and scold the activist right for calling out their pride section for kids when they didn't say a damn thing about BLM and Antifa that caused one hundred and seventy five store closures.
[01:38:12.490 --> 01:38:15.490]  Sorry, you got the wrong one.
[01:38:16.490 --> 01:38:19.490]  And you did this to yourselves.
[01:38:19.490 --> 01:38:27.490]  Target hired an artist that promotes the murder of Christians.
[01:38:27.490 --> 01:38:37.490]  So, yeah, I think I'll go ahead and stand idly by from here on out if somebody wants to smash up a pride thing.
[01:38:37.490 --> 01:38:40.490]  Not going to endorse it. Not going to encourage it.
[01:38:40.490 --> 01:38:50.490]  But I'm not going to condemn it when Target won't even condemn the very movement that led one hundred and seventy five stores to be closed.
[01:38:50.490 --> 01:38:52.490]  So that's a joke.
[01:38:52.490 --> 01:38:59.490]  Backlash and boycott calls hit North Face after ad featuring drag queen inviting everyone to come out.
[01:38:59.490 --> 01:39:03.490]  So what's really going on with this?
[01:39:03.490 --> 01:39:09.490]  Because people keep bringing the fact up that, hey, you know, North Face has done this for like three years now.
[01:39:09.490 --> 01:39:11.490]  Hey, Target has been doing this for five years now.
[01:39:11.490 --> 01:39:12.490]  Hey, none of this is new.
[01:39:12.490 --> 01:39:13.490]  You're right. None of this is new.
[01:39:13.490 --> 01:39:15.490]  But the response is new.
[01:39:15.490 --> 01:39:16.490]  The backlash is new.
[01:39:16.490 --> 01:39:17.490]  The protests are new.
[01:39:17.490 --> 01:39:19.490]  The boycotts are new.
[01:39:19.490 --> 01:39:20.490]  So, yeah, that's it.
[01:39:20.490 --> 01:39:24.490]  That's a story right there.
[01:39:24.490 --> 01:39:28.490]  So maybe this is just like the tide coming in.
[01:39:29.490 --> 01:39:41.490]  Maybe this is just it's finally Americans are starting to realize, wow, these places that I frequent, these places where I spend my money, they really do hate me.
[01:39:41.490 --> 01:39:46.490]  And they really do want my children.
[01:39:46.490 --> 01:39:56.490]  So is this just finally the the Christian activism and American activism just just finally catching tread and realizing what's going on?
[01:39:56.490 --> 01:40:01.490]  Superstar boxer Ryan Garcia takes bold stand against Target's demonic clothing line.
[01:40:01.490 --> 01:40:06.490]  Again, folks, now we're getting into professional sports.
[01:40:06.490 --> 01:40:09.490]  You had a couple NHL hockey players.
[01:40:09.490 --> 01:40:11.490]  I don't know if any of them were Americans.
[01:40:11.490 --> 01:40:14.490]  They might have all been Russian, actually.
[01:40:14.490 --> 01:40:17.490]  Russian born hockey players saying, I'm not going to wear the gay pride shirt.
[01:40:17.490 --> 01:40:19.490]  No, thank you.
[01:40:19.490 --> 01:40:22.490]  There was no punishment from the league, by the way.
[01:40:22.490 --> 01:40:23.490]  So you had that.
[01:40:23.490 --> 01:40:35.490]  You've got all kinds of UFC MMA fighters that have made statements against whether it's Target or the the Epstein sex trafficking.
[01:40:35.490 --> 01:40:39.490]  I can't even imagine, folks.
[01:40:39.490 --> 01:40:42.490]  Because the truth is.
[01:40:42.490 --> 01:40:44.490]  Professional athletes.
[01:40:44.490 --> 01:40:48.490]  I won't say sports media, sports media people think they're the smartest people on Earth.
[01:40:48.490 --> 01:40:49.490]  They're not.
[01:40:49.490 --> 01:40:52.490]  But but they they they probably would love to have their politics heard.
[01:40:52.490 --> 01:40:57.490]  You're starting to see that, folks, most most of these athletes, they don't want anything to do with politics.
[01:40:57.490 --> 01:40:58.490]  They don't want to think or hear about politics.
[01:40:58.490 --> 01:41:00.490]  They don't want to be asked about their politics.
[01:41:00.490 --> 01:41:02.490]  They want to just keep it to themselves.
[01:41:02.490 --> 01:41:12.490]  But because of these sports leagues now being turned into propaganda outlets for the American left, for the communist Marxist left.
[01:41:12.490 --> 01:41:17.490]  I think some of these athletes are going to start speaking up more now.
[01:41:17.490 --> 01:41:24.490]  I think the trend here is is going both ways with the American athletes or at least athletes competing in America professionally.
[01:41:24.490 --> 01:41:29.490]  And then just American Christian conservative activists with the boycotts.
[01:41:29.490 --> 01:41:32.490]  I think this I think this trend is just beginning.
[01:41:32.490 --> 01:41:36.490]  I think this trend is just beginning.
[01:41:36.490 --> 01:41:39.490]  And what a beautiful thing to see in the culture wars.
[01:41:40.490 --> 01:41:47.490]  North Hollywood elementary school parents group planning to keep children home in protest of pride assembly.
[01:41:47.490 --> 01:41:51.490]  So, again, more of this, more of this.
[01:41:51.490 --> 01:41:58.490]  And if it's not just saying, oh, we know they're going to do all this propaganda, the sexual propaganda aimed at our kids.
[01:41:58.490 --> 01:42:00.490]  So we're not going to send them there that week.
[01:42:00.490 --> 01:42:01.490]  No, it's going to turn into.
[01:42:01.490 --> 01:42:06.490]  Well, we're just going to homeschool our kids because the American left now runs the education system.
[01:42:06.490 --> 01:42:13.490]  And my children don't learn anything at school other than the leftist propaganda.
[01:42:13.490 --> 01:42:16.490]  So this is just beginning.
[01:42:16.490 --> 01:42:17.490]  The pushback is just beginning.
[01:42:17.490 --> 01:42:22.490]  But the problem is, as I said at the beginning of the show, this is the unstoppable force meeting the immovable object.
[01:42:22.490 --> 01:42:30.490]  And consider the immovable object, the left wing propaganda and the globalist agenda, because it's all the same front.
[01:42:30.490 --> 01:42:33.490]  The left wing doesn't realize that they're being used for the global government agenda.
[01:42:33.490 --> 01:42:39.490]  They actually think they're virtue signaling social justice warriors because they want to chop little boys and girls up.
[01:42:39.490 --> 01:42:45.490]  No, you're just being used as the front line of the destructive force to destroy America, absorb it into the one world government.
[01:42:45.490 --> 01:42:51.490]  But this realization is starting to sit in.
[01:42:51.490 --> 01:42:54.490]  And I think the pushback has only just begun.
[01:42:54.490 --> 01:42:57.490]  It's an unstoppable force meeting an immovable object.
[01:42:58.490 --> 01:43:04.490]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson and take him off the air.
[01:43:04.490 --> 01:43:05.490]  People said, no way.
[01:43:05.490 --> 01:43:07.490]  He's the most powerful ever happened.
[01:43:07.490 --> 01:43:09.490]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[01:43:09.490 --> 01:43:12.490]  They only had their curls on the air because they believe they control him.
[01:43:12.490 --> 01:43:15.490]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[01:43:15.490 --> 01:43:17.490]  It's the same thing with them for worse.
[01:43:17.490 --> 01:43:23.490]  But in four words, it's not owned by Fox or controlled by George Soros or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[01:43:23.490 --> 01:43:26.490]  We are only beholden to our viewers, our listeners.
[01:43:26.490 --> 01:43:29.490]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[01:43:29.490 --> 01:43:34.490]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[01:43:34.490 --> 01:43:37.490]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[01:43:37.490 --> 01:43:39.490]  So I want to thank you for your support.
[01:43:39.490 --> 01:43:40.490]  Encourage your listeners.
[01:43:40.490 --> 01:43:41.490]  Understand.
[01:43:41.490 --> 01:43:43.490]  Please don't take info wars for granted.
[01:43:43.490 --> 01:43:45.490]  We're barely hanging on.
[01:43:45.490 --> 01:43:47.490]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support.
[01:43:47.490 --> 01:43:49.490]  We'll get a great product at the same time.
[01:43:50.490 --> 01:43:52.490]  So don't procrastinate.
[01:43:58.490 --> 01:44:04.490]  Every time I talk to you, you're either like on the border exposing the cartels and like coming under fire.
[01:44:04.490 --> 01:44:08.490]  Or you're on the streets of some American city hanging out with drug addicts and criminals.
[01:44:08.490 --> 01:44:11.490]  And now you've gone to ground zero of a massive chemical spill.
[01:44:11.490 --> 01:44:13.490]  Are you addicted to the danger, Savannah?
[01:44:13.490 --> 01:44:15.490]  Have you ever considered that for a second?
[01:44:15.490 --> 01:44:18.490]  No, I'm addicted to helping my fellow Americans.
[01:44:18.490 --> 01:44:19.490]  I'm addicted to spreading the truth.
[01:44:19.490 --> 01:44:22.490]  And again, you know, I have info wars to thank for that.
[01:44:22.490 --> 01:44:26.490]  Looking back on the day I was able to ask President Donald Trump two questions.
[01:44:26.490 --> 01:44:32.490]  I was so grateful because, you know, I truly was classically trained under Alex Jones and under the Info Wars team.
[01:44:32.490 --> 01:44:37.490]  I really do credit that as to why I'm able to, you know, get these types of clips.
[01:44:37.490 --> 01:44:41.490]  Because Alex's whole mentality was, you know, go where the story is.
[01:44:41.490 --> 01:44:43.490]  Go where the mainstream media refuses to.
[01:44:43.490 --> 01:44:46.490]  So it's not that I'm addicted to the insanity.
[01:44:46.490 --> 01:44:49.490]  I'm addicted to telling the truth and helping the American people.
[01:44:49.490 --> 01:44:54.490]  And I really do credit Alex for, you know, really instilling that within me early on in my career.
[01:44:59.490 --> 01:45:03.490]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[01:45:03.490 --> 01:45:07.490]  A flying disk has been found and is now in the possession of the Army.
[01:45:07.490 --> 01:45:09.490]  There is a bulletin from CBS News.
[01:45:09.490 --> 01:45:11.490]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[01:45:11.490 --> 01:45:15.490]  This is a different kind of war.
[01:45:15.490 --> 01:45:19.490]  U.S.S. Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and torpedo boats.
[01:45:19.490 --> 01:45:22.490]  The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[01:45:22.490 --> 01:45:26.490]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[01:45:26.490 --> 01:45:30.490]  It was almost as if there were a plan invoked against John F. Kennedy.
[01:45:30.490 --> 01:45:34.490]  We need to go into the Capitol. Stop! Stop! Stop!
[01:45:34.490 --> 01:45:38.490]  You will always have conspiracy theories. They are nothing but distractions.
[01:45:38.490 --> 01:45:43.490]  You guys censored Harvard educated doctors. You silenced those voices.
[01:45:43.490 --> 01:45:46.490]  What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button.
[01:45:46.490 --> 01:45:53.490]  Soon as we start exposing the Great Reset, the sooner these globalists start going to prison.
[01:45:58.490 --> 01:46:03.490]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on Earth.
[01:46:03.490 --> 01:46:06.490]  And they've got our children drinking that.
[01:46:06.490 --> 01:46:12.490]  This is a psychotic death cult. Period. Case closed. Out to get you and your family.
[01:46:12.490 --> 01:46:17.490]  We sell the Alexa Pure Breeze made by the My Patriot Supply Ready Hour Group.
[01:46:17.490 --> 01:46:20.490]  It's been around about 15 years. It became the biggest company in the last six.
[01:46:20.490 --> 01:46:26.490]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system out there that sells for twice the price.
[01:46:26.490 --> 01:46:30.490]  And they made it as good in all the studies.
[01:46:30.490 --> 01:46:33.490]  It reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals.
[01:46:33.490 --> 01:46:37.490]  But you can go pay two or three times. There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[01:46:38.490 --> 01:46:43.490]  We sell the very best highest grade water filtration system for half the price of a leading competitor.
[01:46:43.490 --> 01:46:48.490]  And the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter your water.
[01:46:48.490 --> 01:46:51.490]  You should also filter your shower water. That's another way you absorb this crap.
[01:46:51.490 --> 01:46:53.490]  But I'm done talking about that.
[01:46:53.490 --> 01:46:57.490]  The point is you can get the filters at Infowarstore.com. They're discounted right now.
[01:46:57.490 --> 01:46:58.490]  Finally back in stock.
[01:46:59.490 --> 01:47:03.490]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:47:03.490 --> 01:47:05.490]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:07.390 --> 01:47:32.390]  You are receiving this transmission because you have been chosen to stand up for the Republic,
[01:47:32.390 --> 01:47:39.390]  to stand up for human freedom, prosperity, and the American way of life,
[01:47:39.390 --> 01:47:45.390]  which brought forth the highest standard of living in the modern industrial age,
[01:47:45.390 --> 01:47:49.390]  under attack right now by a group of global criminals,
[01:47:49.390 --> 01:47:56.390]  operating in a satanic, human-sacrifice, population-control cabal.
[01:47:56.390 --> 01:47:59.390]  You are receiving this transmission because you chose this mission,
[01:47:59.390 --> 01:48:06.390]  to stand up for what's right and to save planet Earth from the satanists that want access to your children.
[01:48:06.390 --> 01:48:11.390]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:48:11.390 --> 01:48:15.390]  Now I'm sitting in for Alex Owen Schroer today.
[01:48:15.390 --> 01:48:20.390]  We've got a clip here from Donald Trump.
[01:48:20.390 --> 01:48:27.390]  I want to play a clip here from Donald Trump, the real president of the United States of America, coming up shortly.
[01:48:27.390 --> 01:48:31.390]  Remember, folks, InfowarsStore.com. That's how everything we do here is possible.
[01:48:31.390 --> 01:48:33.390]  Man, oh man, I'm telling you.
[01:48:33.390 --> 01:48:38.390]  TurboForcePlus, InfowarsStore.com. Have you tried it yet, folks?
[01:48:38.390 --> 01:48:41.390]  If not, what are you waiting for?
[01:48:41.390 --> 01:48:45.390]  More power, more strength, more energy.
[01:48:45.390 --> 01:48:48.390]  When it comes to regaining energy, convenience is key.
[01:48:48.390 --> 01:48:53.390]  Sure, coffee, candy, and other highly sugar-filled products can give us a short boost,
[01:48:53.390 --> 01:48:56.390]  but the crash is always the strongest downside.
[01:48:56.390 --> 01:49:02.390]  That's why our team of scientists work with the Infowars crew to create a powerhouse mixable energy formula,
[01:49:02.390 --> 01:49:04.390]  and that's TurboForcePlus.
[01:49:04.390 --> 01:49:11.390]  With the addition of Alpha-GPC to the original formula, we have taken TurboForcePlus to the next level.
[01:49:11.390 --> 01:49:17.390]  This advanced formula can help support increased focus and energy with a sustained energy blend
[01:49:17.390 --> 01:49:22.390]  that contains amino acid for sustained energy metabolism and an herbal energy blend
[01:49:22.390 --> 01:49:27.390]  with very high levels of polyphenols and xanthine alkaloids for peak energy.
[01:49:27.390 --> 01:49:30.390]  TurboForcePlus is a force to be reckoned with.
[01:49:30.390 --> 01:49:34.390]  Figure it out for yourself. Find out for yourself right now.
[01:49:34.390 --> 01:49:38.390]  InfowarsStore.com. TurboForcePlus. 25% off.

[01:49:48.390 --> 01:49:54.390]  All right, Donald Trump releases this statement talking about the corruption of the FBI, the DOJ.
[01:49:54.390 --> 01:49:57.390]  Here's the latest from President Donald Trump.
[01:49:57.390 --> 01:50:05.390]  The Russia hoax was the most atrocious weaponization of our government in American history.
[01:50:05.390 --> 01:50:09.390]  As the Durham report makes clear, it was a crime like no other.
[01:50:09.390 --> 01:50:17.390]  Seven years ago, I ran for office taking on all of the corrupt forces who got rich, bleeding America dry.
[01:50:17.390 --> 01:50:20.390]  They got absolutely rich, so rich you wouldn't even believe it.
[01:50:20.390 --> 01:50:25.390]  Our agenda was a threat to the entire political establishment.
[01:50:25.390 --> 01:50:30.390]  In response, a group of unelected thugs in the senior ranks of our government,
[01:50:30.390 --> 01:50:37.390]  working with Crooked Hillary Clinton, launched a coup attempt to try and sabotage our campaign,
[01:50:37.390 --> 01:50:41.390]  our presidency, our movement and our country.
[01:50:41.390 --> 01:50:46.390]  Crooked Hillary and Crooked Joe Biden. You know, we switch names now.
[01:50:46.390 --> 01:50:51.390]  We call Hillary Lovely Hillary and Crooked Joe because we've seen so much.
[01:50:51.390 --> 01:50:56.390]  And James Comey and Andrew McCabe, Barack Hussein Obama.
[01:50:56.390 --> 01:51:01.390]  All of them and all the rest knew that it was a lie, a total lie.
[01:51:01.390 --> 01:51:06.390]  It was a scam. The entire time was all a big hoax.
[01:51:06.390 --> 01:51:09.390]  And they put our country through hell.
[01:51:09.390 --> 01:51:15.390]  The destruction the Russia hoax caused to America is almost incalculable.
[01:51:15.390 --> 01:51:19.390]  It subverted our democracy and weaponized our law enforcement.
[01:51:19.390 --> 01:51:25.390]  It stoked global conflict and it wrecked countless lives.
[01:51:25.390 --> 01:51:29.390]  It provided the pretext for the left's war on our freedom of speech.
[01:51:29.390 --> 01:51:39.390]  Worst of all, the FBI and the DOJ, both very corrupt, have interfered in every election since 2016.
[01:51:39.390 --> 01:51:44.390]  And now they are interfering in the 2024 presidential election.
[01:51:44.390 --> 01:51:48.390]  Before your very eyes, there must be a reckoning.
[01:51:48.390 --> 01:51:53.390]  For better or worse, accountability for these crimes lies in the hands of the voters.
[01:51:53.390 --> 01:51:56.390]  The Durham report has made the stakes very clear.
[01:51:56.390 --> 01:51:58.390]  And now the choice is ours.
[01:51:58.390 --> 01:52:03.390]  Either the deep state destroys America or we destroy the deep state.
[01:52:03.390 --> 01:52:08.390]  With your vote, we will remove this cancerous culture of corruption from our government.
[01:52:08.390 --> 01:52:13.390]  And we will purge these criminals from the halls of power once and for all.
[01:52:13.390 --> 01:52:16.390]  Our country is in serious trouble. We can't let this happen.
[01:52:16.390 --> 01:52:18.390]  Thank you very much.
[01:52:19.390 --> 01:52:25.390]  Powerful statement from Donald Trump.
[01:52:25.390 --> 01:52:28.390]  I thoroughly enjoyed that.
[01:52:28.390 --> 01:52:30.390]  I thoroughly enjoyed that.
[01:52:30.390 --> 01:52:33.390]  Now here's some of the news pertaining to the statements there.
[01:52:33.390 --> 01:52:40.390]  According to a Rasmussen poll, I believe this was Rasmussen, let me double check.
[01:52:40.390 --> 01:52:42.390]  Yes, Rasmussen.
[01:52:42.390 --> 01:52:48.390]  63% of Americans believe Trump-Russia smear was a hit job.
[01:52:48.390 --> 01:52:51.390]  Majority once involved FBI officials prosecuted.
[01:52:51.390 --> 01:52:58.390]  Folks, I know we're in dark times.
[01:52:58.390 --> 01:53:02.390]  And I know people are suffering through these times.
[01:53:02.390 --> 01:53:04.390]  This is a victory.
[01:53:04.390 --> 01:53:08.390]  The average American knows the truth. Donald Trump's not the criminal.
[01:53:08.390 --> 01:53:13.390]  The average American knows the truth. The right wing in America is not the problem.
[01:53:13.390 --> 01:53:16.390]  We know who the real insurrectionists are.
[01:53:16.390 --> 01:53:18.390]  We know who ran a coup.
[01:53:18.390 --> 01:53:20.390]  It wasn't Donald Trump and his supporters, folks.
[01:53:20.390 --> 01:53:22.390]  It was the Democrats.
[01:53:22.390 --> 01:53:29.390]  And I gotta tell you too, just from somebody that's a media addict, you might say,
[01:53:29.390 --> 01:53:37.390]  I've never seen more people in the media, including on cable news, use the T word.
[01:53:38.390 --> 01:53:42.390]  You know that old word.
[01:53:42.390 --> 01:53:49.390]  FBI, DOJ, and IRS under fire for protecting Bryden crime family, ignoring congressional inquiries.
[01:53:49.390 --> 01:53:50.390]  That's right.
[01:53:50.390 --> 01:53:57.390]  Freed QAnon shaman Jacob Chansley issues statement on peace, forgiveness, and truth.
[01:53:57.390 --> 01:53:59.390]  Talk about a redemption arc.
[01:54:00.390 --> 01:54:06.390]  And I do believe he actually gave his first interview with Pete Santilli.
[01:54:06.390 --> 01:54:10.390]  That might have been yesterday.
[01:54:10.390 --> 01:54:17.390]  So, oh, but oh, he's, you know, the media lied about him.
[01:54:17.390 --> 01:54:20.390]  Oh, he's violent. He's the violent insurrectionist.
[01:54:20.390 --> 01:54:22.390]  And then thank you, Tucker Carlson and crew.
[01:54:22.390 --> 01:54:26.390]  And I guess Kevin McCarthy for giving them access to that footage.
[01:54:26.390 --> 01:54:28.390]  McCarthy said he would give it to all of us.
[01:54:28.390 --> 01:54:31.390]  He didn't, but OK.
[01:54:31.390 --> 01:54:34.390]  At least we got to see what really happened that day in the Capitol.
[01:54:34.390 --> 01:54:39.390]  At least we got to follow around Jacob Chansley, the QAnon shaman, to see what he was really up to.
[01:54:39.390 --> 01:54:42.390]  All he was was nice. All he was was kind.
[01:54:42.390 --> 01:54:46.390]  All he was was being nice, sharing kind words, encouraging people, being peaceful.
[01:54:46.390 --> 01:54:48.390]  So they lied about that.
[01:54:48.390 --> 01:54:54.390]  And for that man to get freed and then share a message of forgiveness and peace and truth.
[01:54:54.390 --> 01:54:56.390]  Powerful. Powerful.
[01:54:56.390 --> 01:55:01.390]  Special Counsel John Durham will testify before Congress on June 21st
[01:55:01.390 --> 01:55:07.390]  on the greatest political scandal in U.S. history, Obama and Hillary's Trump-Russia hoax.
[01:55:07.390 --> 01:55:12.390]  OK, June 21st, set to be a historic day.
[01:55:12.390 --> 01:55:16.390]  I'll be in court that exact same week in D.C., ladies and gentlemen.
[01:55:16.390 --> 01:55:18.390]  How about that?
[01:55:18.390 --> 01:55:25.390]  Top FBI official admits she never read Durham report and doesn't know anyone at FBI who has read it.
[01:55:25.390 --> 01:55:27.390]  Wow.
[01:55:27.390 --> 01:55:29.390]  That tells you something.
[01:55:29.390 --> 01:55:32.390]  Guess they don't take their job too seriously. Huh.
[01:55:32.390 --> 01:55:37.390]  I guess they realize their only real role is to go after conservatives, Trump supporters, Christians,
[01:55:37.390 --> 01:55:40.390]  not actually try to have justice in this country.
[01:55:40.390 --> 01:55:42.390]  Another Department of Justice leak.
[01:55:42.390 --> 01:55:48.390]  Jack Smith's prosecutors have evidence Trump kept classified documents in his office, totally legal,
[01:55:48.390 --> 01:55:50.390]  and showed them to people.
[01:55:50.390 --> 01:55:52.390]  This guy is such a freak, folks.
[01:55:52.390 --> 01:56:01.390]  Look, every day you have Smith and others that are calling hundreds of Trump associates,
[01:56:01.390 --> 01:56:07.390]  questioning them, looking for information, looking for access, anything they can find.
[01:56:07.390 --> 01:56:11.390]  No American has ever been investigated like Donald Trump.
[01:56:11.390 --> 01:56:14.390]  Imagine if they investigated Jeffrey Epstein like they did Donald Trump.
[01:56:14.390 --> 01:56:16.390]  Could you imagine what they'd find then?
[01:56:16.390 --> 01:56:18.390]  Well, they're not interested in finding that.
[01:56:18.390 --> 01:56:20.390]  They just have to get rid of Trump.
[01:56:20.390 --> 01:56:22.390]  And so they got to search for years to try to find anything.
[01:56:22.390 --> 01:56:24.390]  And so far it hasn't worked.
[01:56:24.390 --> 01:56:28.390]  But no, actually, it was your own judge, the liberal judge, Amy Berman Jackson,
[01:56:28.390 --> 01:56:31.390]  that set the precedent when Bill Clinton took the secret documents.
[01:56:31.390 --> 01:56:36.390]  Nothing Trump did with those secret documents or classified documents is illegal,
[01:56:36.390 --> 01:56:40.390]  thanks to the precedent set by Judge Amy Berman Jackson.
[01:56:40.390 --> 01:56:46.390]  Corrupt D.C. judge, META, lectures, Oath Keeper's founder, Stuart Rhodes,
[01:56:46.390 --> 01:56:49.390]  sentences him to 18 years in prison for January 6th.
[01:56:49.390 --> 01:56:56.390]  You have activists on the bench, been warning about this for years.
[01:56:56.390 --> 01:57:00.390]  Charges downgraded for man who crashed U-Haul into White House barriers.
[01:57:00.390 --> 01:57:05.390]  This man admitted in his own witness statement or his own defense statement
[01:57:05.390 --> 01:57:09.390]  and in his own little journal, apparently, that he wanted to go into the White House
[01:57:09.390 --> 01:57:11.390]  and take over the White House.
[01:57:11.390 --> 01:57:13.390]  He said that.
[01:57:13.390 --> 01:57:15.390]  And somehow they're downgrading his charges.
[01:57:15.390 --> 01:57:20.390]  This man who tried to ram a U-Haul through the White House barricades
[01:57:20.390 --> 01:57:26.390]  and go into the White House is probably going to get less of a criminal sentencing
[01:57:26.390 --> 01:57:33.390]  to people who did nothing on January 6th.
[01:57:33.390 --> 01:57:36.390]  Look.
[01:57:36.390 --> 01:57:37.390]  I don't know.
[01:57:37.390 --> 01:57:42.390]  This story about Sy Kandula and the U-Haul truck crash
[01:57:42.390 --> 01:57:44.390]  just keeps getting weirder and weirder.
[01:57:44.390 --> 01:57:49.390]  And I don't know why more people aren't upset about this.
[01:57:49.390 --> 01:57:53.390]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution is laying right there in front of you
[01:57:53.390 --> 01:57:55.390]  hidden in plain view.
[01:57:55.390 --> 01:57:58.390]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[01:57:58.390 --> 01:58:01.390]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website
[01:58:01.390 --> 01:58:06.390]  where they admit the number one cause of cognitive disability in the world
[01:58:06.390 --> 01:58:08.390]  is iodine deficiency.
[01:58:08.390 --> 01:58:12.390]  The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability
[01:58:12.390 --> 01:58:16.390]  is lack of real, pure iodine in the body
[01:58:16.390 --> 01:58:21.390]  as they bomb us with the bad halogens, bromine, bromide, chlorine, and so much more.
[01:58:21.390 --> 01:58:26.390]  Upwards of 2 billion people in a Lancet medical journal study in 2007
[01:58:26.390 --> 01:58:31.390]  worldwide have cognitive disabilities because they don't have high-quality iodine.
[01:58:31.390 --> 01:58:33.390]  Most iodine is bound to other elements.
[01:58:33.390 --> 01:58:34.390]  You don't absorb it.
[01:58:34.390 --> 01:58:37.390]  We have X3, all three types of the good iodine together.
[01:58:37.390 --> 01:58:39.390]  It supercharges your body.
[01:58:39.390 --> 01:58:42.390]  X3 is now back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:58:42.390 --> 01:58:45.390]  It's being sold out for over six months for 25% off.
[01:58:45.390 --> 01:58:46.390]  X3, back in stock.

[01:58:49.390 --> 01:58:51.390]  This is Adam King, host of The Adam King Show,
[01:58:51.390 --> 01:58:54.390]  joined by the one and only Greg Reese of The Reese Report.
[01:58:54.390 --> 01:58:57.390]  We wanted to hop on and send everybody to InfoWarsTore.com.

[01:59:00.390 --> 01:59:06.390]  Buy yourself a Faraday cage, super male vitality, or what Greg has.
[01:59:06.390 --> 01:59:07.390]  Greg, what do you got there?
[01:59:07.390 --> 01:59:09.390]  If you really want to treat yourself to something nice,
[01:59:09.390 --> 01:59:14.390]  get yourself an Alexa Pure water filter and get clean, healthy water
[01:59:14.390 --> 01:59:16.390]  whenever you want it, wherever you want it.
[01:59:16.390 --> 01:59:18.390]  Even if the water pressure goes out,
[01:59:18.390 --> 01:59:22.390]  the gravity-fed water filter has got you covered.
[01:59:22.390 --> 01:59:23.390]  Absolutely.
[01:59:23.390 --> 01:59:28.390]  And we couldn't do any of this without listener support.
[01:59:28.390 --> 01:59:31.390]  I was telling Greg earlier, we're like the real NPR,
[01:59:31.390 --> 01:59:33.390]  the real NPR of the base, right?
[01:59:33.390 --> 01:59:36.390]  So click that QR code right there on your screen right now.
[01:59:36.390 --> 01:59:37.390]  Take out your phone.
[01:59:37.390 --> 01:59:38.390]  Click that QR code.
[01:59:38.390 --> 01:59:40.390]  It'll take you directly to InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:59:40.390 --> 01:59:41.390]  Buy something.
[01:59:41.390 --> 01:59:42.390]  Support the InfoWars.
[01:59:42.390 --> 01:59:45.390]  Keep Alex Jones, Orange Hoyer, Harrison Smith, Greg Reese, Adam King,
[01:59:45.390 --> 01:59:47.390]  and the rest of us on air.
[01:59:47.390 --> 01:59:48.390]  Do it today.
[01:59:48.390 --> 01:59:49.390]  Do it now.
[01:59:49.390 --> 01:59:50.390]  Support the InfoWars.
[01:59:53.390 --> 01:59:57.390]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:03.390 --> 02:00:09.390]  All right.
[02:00:09.390 --> 02:00:14.390]  We got a special message from Alex Jones coming up in the next segment.
[02:00:14.390 --> 02:00:19.390]  I also have incredible footage from the great Timothy Lassley
[02:00:19.390 --> 02:00:23.390]  with a protest that was going down.
[02:00:23.390 --> 02:00:24.390]  He filmed today.
[02:00:24.390 --> 02:00:31.390]  And it's so – I just – there's a moment.
[02:00:31.390 --> 02:00:32.390]  You'll see it in the video coming up.
[02:00:32.390 --> 02:00:36.390]  There's a moment where you realize what it is we're really up against
[02:00:36.390 --> 02:00:43.390]  and the lacking of logic on the other side of the political aisle, let's say.
[02:00:43.390 --> 02:00:45.390]  Full brainwashing on display.
[02:00:45.390 --> 02:00:53.390]  Full MKUltra mind control on display, ladies and gentlemen, to a stunning degree.
[02:00:53.390 --> 02:00:58.390]  So a couple important videos that we'll have coming up for you shortly.
[02:00:58.390 --> 02:01:03.390]  I also do want to take phone calls here in the third hour of the Alex Jones show
[02:01:03.390 --> 02:01:09.390]  before the fourth hour guest host, Jay Dyer, takes over.
[02:01:09.390 --> 02:01:18.390]  So still a lot of big stuff to come on the Alex Jones show.
[02:01:18.390 --> 02:01:22.390]  Let's just do a bit of a news blitz, though, in the meantime.
[02:01:22.390 --> 02:01:27.390]  Cycling governing body bans trans competitors.
[02:01:27.390 --> 02:01:30.390]  Like, that shouldn't even have to be a thing.
[02:01:30.390 --> 02:01:35.390]  If you're a man, I don't care what medical procedures you have to appear to be a woman.
[02:01:35.390 --> 02:01:36.390]  You're still a man.
[02:01:36.390 --> 02:01:38.390]  You shouldn't be competing with women.
[02:01:38.390 --> 02:01:41.390]  And I'm surprised that the feminists don't have a problem with this.
[02:01:41.390 --> 02:01:45.390]  But you realize now that the feminist movement was never even about feminists or women.
[02:01:45.390 --> 02:01:50.390]  It was always about propaganda, left-wing propaganda and mind control.
[02:01:50.390 --> 02:01:54.390]  And now they have feminists that are pro-men competing against women.
[02:01:54.390 --> 02:01:58.390]  So that tells you everything you need to know about that.
[02:01:58.390 --> 02:02:04.390]  Congress to investigate World Health Organization plans to use listening surveillance systems
[02:02:04.390 --> 02:02:06.390]  to identify misinformation.
[02:02:06.390 --> 02:02:09.390]  Stories at Infowars.com.
[02:02:09.390 --> 02:02:11.390]  Oh, oh, oh.
[02:02:11.390 --> 02:02:12.390]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:02:12.390 --> 02:02:14.390]  They're going to be listening to you in your car.
[02:02:14.390 --> 02:02:16.390]  They're going to be listening to you on the phone.
[02:02:16.390 --> 02:02:20.390]  They're going to be listening to you through the television, through the computer.
[02:02:20.390 --> 02:02:22.390]  This is the New World Order they want.
[02:02:22.390 --> 02:02:25.390]  This is the 1984 world that they want.
[02:02:25.390 --> 02:02:30.390]  You can't even breathe without fearing government punishment
[02:02:30.390 --> 02:02:33.390]  if you breathe through the wrong nostril at the wrong time.
[02:02:33.390 --> 02:02:38.390]  Dr. Jill Biden.
[02:02:38.390 --> 02:02:44.390]  Dr. Jill Biden channels Jeb Bush, awkwardly begs audience to clap.
[02:02:44.390 --> 02:02:50.390]  Jill Biden delivered remarks at the Reagan Institute Summit on Education in D.C.
[02:02:50.390 --> 02:02:54.390]  And she wasn't really well-received, so she had to beg the audience to clap.
[02:02:54.390 --> 02:02:56.390]  Oh, but the Bidens are so popular.
[02:02:56.390 --> 02:02:58.390]  Just everywhere Joe Biden goes, he gets booed.
[02:02:58.390 --> 02:03:00.390]  Oh, and let me correct a mistake.
[02:03:00.390 --> 02:03:02.390]  It wasn't the Japanese prime minister.
[02:03:02.390 --> 02:03:06.390]  It was the South Korean president, President Yun from South Korea,
[02:03:06.390 --> 02:03:10.390]  that Joe Biden called loon in Japan.
[02:03:10.390 --> 02:03:11.390]  Imagine that.
[02:03:11.390 --> 02:03:12.390]  Imagine that.
[02:03:12.390 --> 02:03:14.390]  He called the president of South Korea loon.
[02:03:14.390 --> 02:03:16.390]  His name is Yun.
[02:03:16.390 --> 02:03:18.390]  Very presidential.
[02:03:18.390 --> 02:03:20.390]  Very, very presidential there.
[02:03:20.390 --> 02:03:25.390]  Uh-huh.
[02:03:25.390 --> 02:03:29.390]  Foreign electric vehicle manufacturer recalls entire first batch of cars
[02:03:29.390 --> 02:03:34.390]  shipped to U.S. over serious safety issue.
[02:03:34.390 --> 02:03:36.390]  Oh.
[02:03:36.390 --> 02:03:43.390]  When are we going to accept that the whole electric vehicle agenda was just that?
[02:03:43.390 --> 02:03:44.390]  An agenda.
[02:03:44.390 --> 02:03:46.390]  It wasn't organic.
[02:03:46.390 --> 02:03:49.390]  It's not actually more energy efficient or better for the environment.
[02:03:49.390 --> 02:03:51.390]  It was all an agenda.
[02:03:51.390 --> 02:03:54.390]  It was all a giant boondoggle and transfer of wealth.
[02:03:54.390 --> 02:04:00.390]  Same thing with the entire climate change agenda.
[02:04:00.390 --> 02:04:02.390]  Same thing.
[02:04:02.390 --> 02:04:03.390]  Oh, Biden screws up again.
[02:04:03.390 --> 02:04:08.390]  Biden screws up congressman's name in audience during White House event in Rose Garden.
[02:04:08.390 --> 02:04:11.390]  He doesn't even know his own staff.
[02:04:11.390 --> 02:04:13.390]  He doesn't even know his own staff.
[02:04:13.390 --> 02:04:19.390]  He doesn't even know his own appointees and nominees.
[02:04:19.390 --> 02:04:20.390]  He's 80 years old.
[02:04:20.390 --> 02:04:21.390]  He doesn't know where he's at.
[02:04:21.390 --> 02:04:22.390]  He can't even wipe his own ass.
[02:04:22.390 --> 02:04:23.390]  Literally, folks, he can't.
[02:04:23.390 --> 02:04:24.390]  He can't.
[02:04:24.390 --> 02:04:25.390]  I mean, it's actually sad.
[02:04:25.390 --> 02:04:29.390]  But, you know, he always has to wear the aviator sunglasses out.
[02:04:30.390 --> 02:04:31.390]  I don't know.
[02:04:31.390 --> 02:04:34.390]  Has there ever been a president that wears sunglasses for public events and public statements
[02:04:34.390 --> 02:04:35.390]  and press conferences?
[02:04:35.390 --> 02:04:36.390]  I don't think so.
[02:04:36.390 --> 02:04:37.390]  Why Joe Biden?
[02:04:37.390 --> 02:04:41.390]  Because, folks, if you could see his eyes during half these events, you'd see that this
[02:04:41.390 --> 02:04:48.390]  is a man who is barely even holding on to any cognitive ability at all.
[02:04:48.390 --> 02:04:53.390]  And the drugs they have him on probably make his eyeballs and his pupils pop out of his skull.
[02:04:59.390 --> 02:05:04.390]  Sold out for more than a year, we now have back in stock a limited run of our extremely
[02:05:04.390 --> 02:05:09.390]  popular Tooth Whitening Coral Calcium Toothpaste full of essential oils.

[02:05:49.390 --> 02:05:51.390]  I thank you for your support.

[02:06:07.390 --> 02:06:14.390]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:14.390 --> 02:06:18.390]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:06:24.390 --> 02:06:44.390]  And now, a special message from an undisclosed location in far-off regions of planet Earth.
[02:06:44.390 --> 02:06:48.390]  The signal is hazy, but we hear now from Alex Jones.
[02:06:49.390 --> 02:06:53.390]  A lot of people ask me, how am I doing?
[02:06:53.390 --> 02:06:56.390]  Demonized, attacked by the entire system.
[02:06:56.390 --> 02:07:01.390]  The answer is, I'm doing great, because I'm on the side of awakening humanity
[02:07:01.390 --> 02:07:03.390]  to the globalist threat that's out in the open.
[02:07:03.390 --> 02:07:06.390]  I've been completely and totally vindicated.
[02:07:06.390 --> 02:07:12.390]  And if I had it all over to do again, I'd do it again, because I believe in humanity.
[02:07:12.390 --> 02:07:14.390]  I've bet on humanity.
[02:07:14.390 --> 02:07:17.390]  The entire world government is out in the open.
[02:07:17.390 --> 02:07:21.390]  The intelligence agency spying and censoring the American people is all public.
[02:07:21.390 --> 02:07:26.390]  The fact that the COVID shots have been absolutely poisoned is all out in the open.
[02:07:26.390 --> 02:07:31.390]  The fact that our government has been hijacked by hardcore criminals is out in the open,
[02:07:31.390 --> 02:07:34.390]  and the people are awakening.
[02:07:34.390 --> 02:07:38.390]  We were going to lose everything and go into total totalitarianism
[02:07:38.390 --> 02:07:41.390]  if people like myself didn't stand up and take the attacks.
[02:07:41.390 --> 02:07:45.390]  So, do I like being at the tip of the spear, being under attack? No.
[02:07:45.390 --> 02:07:49.390]  But I love the results of doing it, and so I'm very proud and very honored
[02:07:49.390 --> 02:07:52.390]  that I'm still on air, thanks to all of you.
[02:07:52.390 --> 02:07:55.390]  People make the joke that Alex Jones was right, or they say,
[02:07:55.390 --> 02:07:58.390]  the Babylon Bee today, Alex Jones hired as a CDC director
[02:07:58.390 --> 02:08:01.390]  because he told the truth about everything and was right.
[02:08:01.390 --> 02:08:03.390]  But culture gets that.
[02:08:03.390 --> 02:08:07.390]  So despite all the propaganda and all the brainwashing and all the disinformation,
[02:08:07.390 --> 02:08:11.390]  the people deep down know that populism and common sense
[02:08:11.390 --> 02:08:14.390]  and Americana is the answer to globalist tyranny.
[02:08:14.390 --> 02:08:17.390]  That's why the new world order wants to destroy America,
[02:08:17.390 --> 02:08:21.390]  because the idea of America and wealth and independence and prosperity
[02:08:21.390 --> 02:08:25.390]  and the middle class and competition threatens their monopoly, their centralized cult.
[02:08:25.390 --> 02:08:30.390]  So there's the globalist cult of tyranny and centralization and corporate control,
[02:08:30.390 --> 02:08:34.390]  and then there is the cult of America, free market, middle class, competition,
[02:08:34.390 --> 02:08:36.390]  open free societies.
[02:08:36.390 --> 02:08:38.390]  They're not pushing a free society.
[02:08:38.390 --> 02:08:41.390]  They're pushing a tyranny and advertising it as a free society
[02:08:41.390 --> 02:08:46.390]  and claiming the free society, the 1776 Renaissance system is the enemy.
[02:08:46.390 --> 02:08:48.390]  It's not. It's the answer.
[02:08:48.390 --> 02:08:51.390]  So I'll continue to fight on, and I'm proud of what I've been able to do.
[02:08:51.390 --> 02:08:55.390]  Thanks for your support, and I'll see you all weekdays, 11 a.m. Central,
[02:08:55.390 --> 02:08:58.390]  at Infowars.com for the forbidden transmission.
[02:08:58.390 --> 02:09:00.390]  God bless, and good luck.
[02:09:00.390 --> 02:09:05.390]  Now, I want to respond to that statement from Alex Jones
[02:09:05.390 --> 02:09:09.390]  and rewind the clocks, because we're dealing with this issue
[02:09:10.390 --> 02:09:13.390]  that Alex Jones warned about more than two decades ago.
[02:09:13.390 --> 02:09:18.390]  First, quickly, though, I do want to take calls for the rest of this third hour,
[02:09:18.390 --> 02:09:22.390]  and so anything we've covered, you know what, we'll just say open lines.
[02:09:22.390 --> 02:09:29.390]  It's Friday, so open lines Friday, 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539.
[02:09:29.390 --> 02:09:31.390]  Anything you want to call in on, we will discuss,
[02:09:31.390 --> 02:09:34.390]  and there's some other news I haven't gotten to yet either.
[02:09:35.390 --> 02:09:44.390]  But that sounds like Alex Jones responding to the Patriot Act
[02:09:44.390 --> 02:09:48.390]  that was put into place during the George Bush administration.
[02:09:48.390 --> 02:09:52.390]  And at the time, he warned this Patriot Act,
[02:09:52.390 --> 02:09:57.390]  it's not about targeting Islamic extremists or radical terrorists
[02:09:57.390 --> 02:10:00.390]  that want to hurt Americans or blow up buildings or whatever
[02:10:00.390 --> 02:10:03.390]  in response to 9-11. That was all a giant false flag.
[02:10:03.390 --> 02:10:08.390]  It was really about aiming the U.S. government against you.
[02:10:08.390 --> 02:10:13.390]  And now here we are. It's been totally proven in triplicate.
[02:10:13.390 --> 02:10:19.390]  And so now the Heritage Foundation has a great report, very important,
[02:10:19.390 --> 02:10:22.390]  as well as reporting being done by Town Hall and the Federalist.
[02:10:22.390 --> 02:10:27.390]  It's all in the news today, but they have the actual documents.
[02:10:27.390 --> 02:10:34.390]  The MRC has uncovered a DHS anti-terrorism program
[02:10:34.390 --> 02:10:36.390]  that's been weaponized against conservatives,
[02:10:36.390 --> 02:10:40.390]  80 grants and $40 million taxpayer dollars later.
[02:10:40.390 --> 02:10:42.390]  Here's a look at how Joe Biden and Secretary Mayorkas
[02:10:42.390 --> 02:10:45.390]  are outsourcing their efforts to conflate conservatives with terrorists.
[02:10:45.390 --> 02:10:50.390]  And they just claim anybody who's on the right wing of the political spectrum,
[02:10:50.390 --> 02:10:55.390]  you are the violent extremist that the government is going to shut down,
[02:10:55.390 --> 02:11:00.390]  arrest, and destroy. Now, you're obviously not a violent extremist.
[02:11:00.390 --> 02:11:06.390]  The National Rifle Association is the largest civil rights group in America.
[02:11:06.390 --> 02:11:09.390]  Infowars is a news broadcast.
[02:11:09.390 --> 02:11:14.390]  And then they try to liken you to radical left movements
[02:11:14.390 --> 02:11:17.390]  like the National Socialist Workers Party movement
[02:11:17.390 --> 02:11:21.390]  that we call Nazis of Adolf Hitler. That's leftism.
[02:11:21.390 --> 02:11:23.390]  All this stuff that they have at the top,
[02:11:23.390 --> 02:11:27.390]  all this Nazi crap that they have at this top, this is leftism, folks.
[02:11:27.390 --> 02:11:29.390]  Socialism is a left-wing policy.
[02:11:29.390 --> 02:11:31.390]  I'm so sick and tired of having to explain this, but what do we expect?
[02:11:31.390 --> 02:11:34.390]  Because leftists lie, and so they lie about themselves,
[02:11:34.390 --> 02:11:36.390]  and they lie about you as well.
[02:11:36.390 --> 02:11:42.390]  But no, this just proves Alex Jones was right 20-plus years ago
[02:11:42.390 --> 02:11:45.390]  when he said the Patriot Act was going to be used to come after you,
[02:11:45.390 --> 02:11:50.390]  not what they would call Islamic extremist terrorists in that time space.
[02:11:50.390 --> 02:11:53.390]  And he was right again.
[02:11:53.390 --> 02:11:56.390]  Now, what's pathetic is the lack of response and action
[02:11:56.390 --> 02:12:02.390]  from the Republican Party in response to this, but yet here we are.
[02:12:02.390 --> 02:12:05.390]  More reporting can be found at Town Hall.
[02:12:05.390 --> 02:12:10.390]  Bombshell documents reveal Biden DHS wants to paint Christians,
[02:12:10.390 --> 02:12:13.390]  conservatives as Nazis and terrorists.
[02:12:13.390 --> 02:12:18.390]  The Federalist, state-funded University of Texas-managed censorship project
[02:12:18.390 --> 02:12:20.390]  targeting conservative outlets.
[02:12:20.390 --> 02:12:22.390]  It also is going on at University of Dayton.
[02:12:22.390 --> 02:12:24.390]  We have this.
[02:12:24.390 --> 02:12:28.390]  University of Dayton is one of the most radical grant recipients for the program,
[02:12:28.390 --> 02:12:33.390]  receiving $352,000 to fight domestic violent extremism and hate movements,
[02:12:33.390 --> 02:12:35.390]  which it's none of the above.
[02:12:35.390 --> 02:12:38.390]  It's just anything that's to the right on the political spectrum
[02:12:38.390 --> 02:12:40.390]  or anything considered Christian or conservative.
[02:12:40.390 --> 02:12:44.390]  Biden's DHS awarded the grant despite their application,
[02:12:44.390 --> 02:12:48.390]  including the fallacious chart that you see here in front of you.
[02:12:48.390 --> 02:12:49.390]  So it's all lies.
[02:12:49.390 --> 02:12:50.390]  It's all propaganda.
[02:12:50.390 --> 02:12:52.390]  It's all the left.
[02:12:52.390 --> 02:12:55.390]  Historically speaking, folks, it's the left.
[02:12:55.390 --> 02:12:57.390]  And it's just amazing.
[02:12:57.390 --> 02:13:05.390]  It's just amazing because how many people died in the 20th century
[02:13:05.390 --> 02:13:10.390]  fighting the ideals, the values, the political practices
[02:13:10.390 --> 02:13:15.390]  that comes with the left-wing political ideology, communism, socialism.
[02:13:15.390 --> 02:13:17.390]  Millions died.
[02:13:17.390 --> 02:13:23.390]  Millions died in wars and millions died in starvation and famine.
[02:13:23.390 --> 02:13:27.390]  I thought we learned that lesson in the 20th century.
[02:13:27.390 --> 02:13:29.390]  I thought we learned that lesson.
[02:13:29.390 --> 02:13:37.390]  I thought it was solidified, especially into our DNA in the Western Hemisphere,
[02:13:37.390 --> 02:13:41.390]  in the United States of America, in North America.
[02:13:41.390 --> 02:13:44.390]  We don't do communism.
[02:13:44.390 --> 02:13:46.390]  We don't do socialism.
[02:13:46.390 --> 02:13:49.390]  We don't do left-wing bull crap.
[02:13:49.390 --> 02:13:52.390]  It ends in bloodshed and starvation and death.
[02:13:52.390 --> 02:13:59.390]  We defeated it, and we said no more, and we celebrated that.
[02:13:59.390 --> 02:14:01.390]  And now here you are in the 21st century,
[02:14:01.390 --> 02:14:06.390]  and you're going to have to deal with it on your own soil.
[02:14:06.390 --> 02:14:13.390]  It's almost impossible to believe, and yet here we are.
[02:14:13.390 --> 02:14:16.390]  Germany jails man for supporting Russia.
[02:14:16.390 --> 02:14:20.390]  I'm afraid that's coming to the United States very soon.
[02:14:20.390 --> 02:14:23.390]  And they might not just outright say we're arresting you for supporting Russia,
[02:14:23.390 --> 02:14:25.390]  but they'll blame it for something else, but they know,
[02:14:25.390 --> 02:14:30.390]  oh, you're going against the regime's war against Russia
[02:14:30.390 --> 02:14:32.390]  that does nothing to benefit the United States?
[02:14:32.390 --> 02:14:35.390]  You're going to be disappeared.
[02:14:35.390 --> 02:14:37.390]  Powder keg Europe.
[02:14:37.390 --> 02:14:40.390]  Russian official predicts the end of Ukraine.
[02:14:40.390 --> 02:14:44.390]  Polish military ready to intervene in case of coup in Belarus.
[02:14:44.390 --> 02:14:46.390]  Georgia being pressured into military action against Putin.
[02:14:46.390 --> 02:14:49.390]  Folks, the whole thing is coming apart at the seams.
[02:14:49.390 --> 02:14:52.390]  And the reason why you're not hearing much about it in the U.S. media
[02:14:52.390 --> 02:14:54.390]  or from the Biden administration,
[02:14:54.390 --> 02:14:56.390]  because every plan that they've had to defeat Russia
[02:14:56.390 --> 02:15:00.390]  or every plan they've had to protect their vassal proxy state of Ukraine
[02:15:00.390 --> 02:15:03.390]  has failed miserably, and you've had to pay the price,
[02:15:03.390 --> 02:15:05.390]  and many have had to die.
[02:15:05.390 --> 02:15:10.390]  So it's really a disgusting embarrassment of death,
[02:15:10.390 --> 02:15:14.390]  what the Biden administration has done in Ukraine.
[02:15:14.390 --> 02:15:17.390]  All right, more news and your calls coming up here
[02:15:17.390 --> 02:15:19.390]  in the third hour of the Alex Jones show.
[02:15:19.390 --> 02:15:21.390]  Folks, by the way, Alex is out.
[02:15:21.390 --> 02:15:23.390]  You just heard from Alex.
[02:15:23.390 --> 02:15:26.390]  He's not planning on going anywhere, but we need to keep this platform on the air.
[02:15:26.390 --> 02:15:30.390]  So go to Infowarsstore.com in this short break.
[02:15:30.390 --> 02:15:31.390]  Click that Donate tab.
[02:15:31.390 --> 02:15:33.390]  Give us $5, $10, $50.
[02:15:33.390 --> 02:15:35.390]  Let's keep Infowars on the air.
[02:15:35.390 --> 02:15:37.390]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:15:37.390 --> 02:15:39.390]  Click that Donate tab.
[02:15:39.390 --> 02:15:42.390]  It would make Alex a very happy man,
[02:15:42.390 --> 02:15:45.390]  and it would do a lot of work to keep us on the air.
[02:15:45.390 --> 02:15:47.390]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:15:47.390 --> 02:15:49.390]  Now, when we come back,
[02:15:49.390 --> 02:15:55.390]  your phone calls here on the third hour of the Alex Jones show at Infowars.com.
[02:15:56.390 --> 02:16:00.390]  Turbo Force is back, sold out for eight months,
[02:16:00.390 --> 02:16:02.390]  and it's Turbo Force Plus.
[02:16:02.390 --> 02:16:04.390]  We made it even stronger.
[02:16:04.390 --> 02:16:08.390]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[02:16:08.390 --> 02:16:15.390]  Turbo Force is back in stock at Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:16:15.390 --> 02:16:21.390]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[02:16:21.390 --> 02:16:23.390]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[02:16:23.390 --> 02:16:27.390]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things
[02:16:27.390 --> 02:16:31.390]  and amino acids that turbocharge everything
[02:16:31.390 --> 02:16:35.390]  and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[02:16:35.390 --> 02:16:38.390]  It is the super fuel.
[02:16:38.390 --> 02:16:40.390]  Rain Force Plus is great.
[02:16:40.390 --> 02:16:41.390]  Rain Force Alt is great.
[02:16:41.390 --> 02:16:42.390]  They're two different nootropics.
[02:16:42.390 --> 02:16:45.390]  They go good with this, but this is the king Kong.
[02:16:45.390 --> 02:16:47.390]  This is the boss.
[02:16:47.390 --> 02:16:51.390]  Turbo Force, back in stock, discounted, Infowarsstore.com.
[02:16:51.390 --> 02:16:57.390]  More power, more strength, more energy.
[02:16:57.390 --> 02:17:05.390]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[02:17:05.390 --> 02:17:08.390]  I want you all to know something, Alex Jones was right.
[02:17:08.390 --> 02:17:12.390]  Alex is right about far more than is wrong.
[02:17:12.390 --> 02:17:15.390]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[02:17:15.390 --> 02:17:19.390]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up, or rub it down,
[02:17:19.390 --> 02:17:21.390]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:17:21.390 --> 02:17:25.390]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[02:17:25.390 --> 02:17:29.390]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[02:17:29.390 --> 02:17:33.390]  Alex Jones called this years ago, years ago.
[02:17:33.390 --> 02:17:37.390]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[02:17:37.390 --> 02:17:39.390]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[02:17:39.390 --> 02:17:42.390]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[02:17:42.390 --> 02:17:45.390]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[02:17:45.390 --> 02:17:50.390]  That's why the globalists hate me, is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[02:17:58.390 --> 02:18:01.390]  I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had.
[02:18:01.390 --> 02:18:03.390]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[02:18:03.390 --> 02:18:07.390]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[02:18:07.390 --> 02:18:12.390]  When we talk about the crew at Infowars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[02:18:13.390 --> 02:18:16.390]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[02:18:16.390 --> 02:18:21.390]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day,
[02:18:21.390 --> 02:18:25.390]  five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[02:18:25.390 --> 02:18:29.390]  So for myself and the whole Infowars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[02:18:29.390 --> 02:18:35.390]  I only encourage you now to realize that Infowars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[02:18:35.390 --> 02:18:38.390]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[02:18:38.390 --> 02:18:42.390]  But most viewers and listeners never go to Infowarsstore.com,
[02:18:42.390 --> 02:18:45.390]  and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life,
[02:18:45.390 --> 02:18:47.390]  all at the same time keep us on air.
[02:18:47.390 --> 02:18:51.390]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:18:51.390 --> 02:18:56.390]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to Infowarsstore.com, our funding problems will be over.
[02:18:56.390 --> 02:18:57.390]  Please take action now.
[02:18:57.390 --> 02:19:01.390]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World,
[02:19:01.390 --> 02:19:04.390]  is a historic book that documents the globalists in their own words,
[02:19:04.390 --> 02:19:07.390]  plan for our future, that is the hellish future.
[02:19:07.390 --> 02:19:10.390]  Now you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[02:19:10.390 --> 02:19:13.390]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World
[02:19:13.390 --> 02:19:16.390]  at bookstores, Amazon, or Infowarsstore.com.
[02:19:16.390 --> 02:19:22.390]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[02:19:22.390 --> 02:19:24.390]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[02:19:24.390 --> 02:19:30.390]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World, a signed copy, at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:19:30.390 --> 02:19:34.390]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[02:19:34.390 --> 02:19:37.390]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book,
[02:19:37.390 --> 02:19:40.390]  you'll also know that you help keep Infowars on the air.
[02:19:40.390 --> 02:19:44.390]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned copies.
[02:19:44.390 --> 02:19:48.390]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to Infowarsstore.com
[02:19:48.390 --> 02:19:52.390]  and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate them to the library
[02:19:52.390 --> 02:19:54.390]  or give them to the local school.
[02:19:54.390 --> 02:19:57.390]  This is an Infowar, I'm counting on you, and thank you for your support.
[02:19:58.390 --> 02:20:03.390]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:20:03.390 --> 02:20:05.390]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:20:06.970 --> 02:20:35.369]  Late before I take your phone calls, because I'd be surprised if many of you didn't want
[02:20:35.369 --> 02:20:43.050]  to comment on this as well. I've explained this before that I kind of waver on my Elon
[02:20:43.050 --> 02:20:50.369]  Musk, let's say approval rating. I keep it pretty tight around the 50% approve or disprove.
[02:20:50.369 --> 02:20:58.230]  I'm still I would say 51% approval rating for Elon Musk for for my opinion. 51% approval
[02:20:58.230 --> 02:21:03.490]  rating mean he can easily go back down to 50 or 49 in a negative. But this is the type
[02:21:03.490 --> 02:21:10.210]  of crap that I've always said I don't like from Elon Musk. Elon Musk's brain computer
[02:21:10.210 --> 02:21:20.810]  company Neuralink receives FDA approval to launch human clinical trial. Now, I'm willing
[02:21:20.810 --> 02:21:26.050]  to wait and see what this technology does, what it brings that the one thing that is
[02:21:26.050 --> 02:21:33.130]  already bad is that they have tested this on animals. And that's usually kind of a gateway
[02:21:33.130 --> 02:21:40.289]  into Satanism, folks, that's usually a gateway into sacrifice, human sacrifice. And I know
[02:21:40.289 --> 02:21:46.810]  there's a lot of stories out there where doctors and others that refuse to be engaged in animal
[02:21:46.810 --> 02:21:50.689]  abuse for testing end up losing everything because it's kind of the test. Like, are you
[02:21:50.689 --> 02:21:52.970]  going to be in the club? Are you going to be in the Satanist club? You're going to be
[02:21:52.970 --> 02:21:56.490]  in the criminal cabal? Well, let's see if they're willing to do harm to animals. And
[02:21:56.490 --> 02:21:59.970]  then if it's yes, well, we can take them next level. They refuse at that level, then they
[02:21:59.970 --> 02:22:04.929]  don't make it. So what what Neuralink was doing with animals is extremely concerning
[02:22:04.929 --> 02:22:10.730]  to me. Now, I'm willing to give it all a chance because I'm not a Luddite. And if Elon Musk
[02:22:10.730 --> 02:22:15.369]  creates technology that can make blind people see or stuff like that, then then why would
[02:22:15.369 --> 02:22:19.609]  I be against that? I don't know. You might have a different opinion. But I will tell
[02:22:19.609 --> 02:22:26.730]  you this. From where I stand right now, I have zero interest in this technology. I want
[02:22:26.730 --> 02:22:33.570]  nothing to do with anything being drilled into my head or attached to my brain. We'll
[02:22:33.570 --> 02:22:43.090]  continue to monitor this development at Infowars.com. But now we go to the phone lines on a Friday
[02:22:43.090 --> 02:22:49.170]  here on the Alex Jones show. And we start with Matt in Southern California. Matt, you're
[02:22:49.170 --> 02:22:53.490]  on the air. Go ahead. Hey, Owen, good to talk to you again. I was the airline pilot that
[02:22:53.490 --> 02:22:58.170]  called a few weeks ago to promote Turbo Force Plus. But real quick, I got to say, like I
[02:22:58.170 --> 02:23:02.170]  said, great talk. You've got the voice that can make a Wolverine perk and a beard that
[02:23:02.170 --> 02:23:07.890]  makes Leonidas from the 300 look like a hobo. But can we quote that? I'd like that. I want
[02:23:07.890 --> 02:23:14.170]  to cut that. I'm stealing that from you. Absolutely. Go for it. Also, I'm also a father of a couple
[02:23:14.170 --> 02:23:19.929]  of young kids and I'm in my 40s. So Turbo Force really helps me to keep up with my kids. Anybody
[02:23:19.970 --> 02:23:23.810]  that's a parent that's got young kids that run around and have way more energy than you
[02:23:23.810 --> 02:23:27.529]  could ever possibly imagine, man, Turbo Force definitely helps with that too. Anyway, the
[02:23:27.529 --> 02:23:30.970]  other point I wanted to, a couple of the points, definitely shout out to the airline
[02:23:30.970 --> 02:23:34.849]  pilots that never took the jabs. You know, good on you guys. Keep doing that. You know,
[02:23:34.849 --> 02:23:39.090]  obviously, that's all kind of winding down, but still never forget what they did to us,
[02:23:39.410 --> 02:23:43.090]  dressing us out about our jobs, because we got to pay for that roof overhead, the food
[02:23:43.090 --> 02:23:47.849]  that goes on our tables. So good job, guys and gals, for not doing that. Also, shout
[02:23:47.849 --> 02:23:52.210]  out to any other Californians listening right now, living behind enemy lines. Hopefully
[02:23:52.210 --> 02:23:55.810]  we can turn the ship around. I know a lot of people left, but you know, some of us are
[02:23:55.810 --> 02:24:01.050]  staying and fighting like me. The last part with Target, I've been a customer at Target
[02:24:01.050 --> 02:24:05.410]  for a lot of years, especially with the kids, having a Target red card account. Anybody
[02:24:05.410 --> 02:24:10.970]  familiar with that? To make a statement to Target and part of the boycott is to take
[02:24:10.970 --> 02:24:17.210]  those cards and shred them. And if somebody could start a Twitter, you know, hashtag of
[02:24:17.210 --> 02:24:21.890]  like shred the red card and make that a trend so we could take it back to Target and say
[02:24:21.890 --> 02:24:28.570]  we're done. You're not we are not supporting selling trans stuff to kids. No way. If a
[02:24:28.570 --> 02:24:32.689]  consensual adults want to go into some gay bar, blah, blah, blah in West Hollywood, I
[02:24:32.689 --> 02:24:37.250]  don't care. Or Laguna Beach. I don't care. But do not sell it to kids. Do not sell this
[02:24:37.289 --> 02:24:41.010]  stuff to kids. And that whole thing earlier about their their little parades where they
[02:24:41.010 --> 02:24:45.369]  can't go around nude, which I know Alex has shown videos of that stuff and obviously blurred
[02:24:45.369 --> 02:24:49.890]  images and everything. But that is totally unacceptable. Never, ever will we ever support
[02:24:49.890 --> 02:24:50.890]  anything like that again.
[02:24:52.609 --> 02:24:58.570]  Well said, Matt. That's about as that's that's an A plus call right there. And look, you
[02:24:58.570 --> 02:25:06.130]  got to understand, too, folks, this is a hard thing. I try to express this. Most people,
[02:25:06.130 --> 02:25:11.609]  most Americans that you see throughout your life, just just your daily routine have date.
[02:25:11.609 --> 02:25:16.650]  Most people still don't know what planet they live on, to put it simply. They just don't
[02:25:16.650 --> 02:25:22.010]  have a clue. And so when you get exposed to all this left wing propaganda and all this
[02:25:22.010 --> 02:25:26.490]  left wing pushback, they just assume that's the majority. That's the populace. So that's
[02:25:26.490 --> 02:25:31.330]  going to be the control factors here. They're starting to see that's not the case. They're
[02:25:31.330 --> 02:25:35.130]  starting to see. Wait a second. No, actually, conservatives and Christians and Republican
[02:25:35.130 --> 02:25:39.130]  voters, wait a second. They're out there, too. They're out there in mass. And they actually
[02:25:39.130 --> 02:25:44.609]  are a force to be reckoned with now. But we have to exhibit that. We have to flex that.
[02:25:44.609 --> 02:25:49.970]  I think that that's finally happening. A target boycott would be another way to do so. Thanks
[02:25:49.970 --> 02:25:56.170]  for the call, Matt. Let's go to Sam in Tennessee. Sam, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:25:57.410 --> 02:26:01.529]  Hey, Owen, I don't know if you remember, but we talked once before in twenty twenty
[02:26:01.529 --> 02:26:06.369]  one. And I honest to God, I could probably write your ear off about a million things
[02:26:06.369 --> 02:26:12.210]  right now, but I'm going to focus on the one weighing on me today. And that is, as I've
[02:26:12.210 --> 02:26:18.410]  heard it, the digital currency thing has only been outright banned in Texas and Florida
[02:26:18.410 --> 02:26:23.250]  and here in Tennessee. Even though we tend to win these kind of things at least more often
[02:26:23.250 --> 02:26:28.410]  than we lose them. Pretty sure we haven't banned it here. And that's just been bothering
[02:26:28.410 --> 02:26:35.570]  me all day because my entire. Lifestyle kind of relies on cash being a thing. I'm kind
[02:26:35.570 --> 02:26:40.010]  of just wondering if you or anyone else there have any advice for anyone who needs to push
[02:26:40.010 --> 02:26:47.010]  back on that in their own state? Well, I mean, you got to you got to get involved with your
[02:26:47.010 --> 02:26:51.750]  local activist groups, maybe even the Republican Party, you know, to put political pressure
[02:26:51.750 --> 02:26:58.470]  on these situations. The problem is this issue is not going to really reach ahead until
[02:26:58.470 --> 02:27:03.230]  they want it to. So they kind of they kind of tested, tested it. They put it out there
[02:27:03.230 --> 02:27:06.470]  in the public, see all the public responded. It was a negative response. So they've kind
[02:27:06.470 --> 02:27:13.310]  of sat back on their heels with it. Now, my expectation is. They're going to really push
[02:27:13.310 --> 02:27:18.510]  or cement even the digital currency after some sort of a market collapse or financial collapse
[02:27:18.510 --> 02:27:24.710]  or big bank collapse, which may at this point be inevitable. So maybe the right move is to just
[02:27:24.710 --> 02:27:29.109]  make sure your local politicians, your local activist groups are aware that this is out
[02:27:29.109 --> 02:27:34.510]  there so that kind of like with the pandemic, you know, we warned, hey, they're going to try
[02:27:34.510 --> 02:27:38.949]  to shut you down, shut down your business and force you to take this vaccine. And a lot of
[02:27:38.949 --> 02:27:43.230]  people were prepared when that all came. So, you know, just getting them ready for this,
[02:27:43.230 --> 02:27:47.150]  getting them understanding what it's all about, a global digital currency that can be turned off
[02:27:47.310 --> 02:27:52.349]  if you don't. If you're not a good slave, they'll just turn your currency, your ability
[02:27:52.349 --> 02:27:58.390]  to buy and sell off. So I think it's just about putting that awareness out there before
[02:27:58.390 --> 02:28:06.869]  we get to that point. Yeah, I got one more similar question and then I'll just pop off
[02:28:06.869 --> 02:28:13.029]  here, but for anyone in their late 20s who is trying to homestead and find self-sufficiency
[02:28:13.070 --> 02:28:15.750]  for the first time, do you have any advice for them?
[02:28:20.269 --> 02:28:25.470]  No, if you don't. I mean, just do it. Do it. Yeah, just do it.
[02:28:27.269 --> 02:28:33.109]  Just do it. All right. Good talking to you. Yeah. No, look, I mean, it's just I'm not the
[02:28:33.109 --> 02:28:39.869]  master homesteader and I'm not like a green thumb or anything like that. So I can't really
[02:28:39.869 --> 02:28:44.710]  speak from experience, quite frankly. I've been trying to do that at my house for a
[02:28:44.710 --> 02:28:48.869]  while. I'm just too busy. So I'd be a hypocrite if I acted like I was the expert on that.
[02:28:49.109 --> 02:28:54.390]  So I would just say, yeah, I would say homestead, get some chickens, do as much as you can
[02:28:54.390 --> 02:28:56.150]  to be self-sufficient and independent.
[02:28:58.269 --> 02:29:03.029]  Please give me one minute of your time. Please write this down and please go look this up.
[02:29:03.070 --> 02:29:08.509]  It will change your life. The U.N. admits and the Lancet Medical Journal admits that
[02:29:08.509 --> 02:29:13.430]  upwards of two billion people have mental disabilities and declining cognitive
[02:29:13.430 --> 02:29:18.830]  abilities. The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[02:29:19.189 --> 02:29:24.390]  Most iodine in the environment is bound to other elements so your body can't absorb it.
[02:29:24.789 --> 02:29:29.070]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[02:29:29.310 --> 02:29:35.789]  And Infowarsstore.com has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of full
[02:29:35.830 --> 02:29:39.189]  effect. Ladies and gentlemen, X3 has been sold out for six months.
[02:29:39.550 --> 02:29:40.710]  It's very hard to produce.
[02:29:40.910 --> 02:29:42.590]  And it's finally back in stock.
[02:29:43.070 --> 02:29:44.990]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[02:29:45.390 --> 02:29:47.430]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is powerful.
[02:29:47.670 --> 02:29:48.830]  You and your family need it.
[02:29:49.029 --> 02:29:50.750]  It's 25 percent off back in stock.
[02:29:51.109 --> 02:29:55.189]  X3, triiodine exclusively at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:29:55.430 --> 02:29:58.029]  Take action now. But regardless, research is info.
[02:29:58.109 --> 02:30:04.550]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into
[02:30:04.550 --> 02:30:08.109]  the atmosphere. The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[02:30:08.310 --> 02:30:14.710]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers to convert these gases
[02:30:14.789 --> 02:30:16.430]  into fluorosilicic acid.
[02:30:16.670 --> 02:30:18.869]  Still highly toxic, but containable.
[02:30:19.109 --> 02:30:24.029]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison and there was no affordable way to
[02:30:24.029 --> 02:30:29.109]  dispose of it. Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the Secretary of
[02:30:29.109 --> 02:30:33.109]  the Treasury, who was responsible for the public health service at the time.
[02:30:33.349 --> 02:30:35.269]  And by 1950, the U.S.
[02:30:35.269 --> 02:30:41.109]  government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product and dumping it into
[02:30:41.109 --> 02:30:46.470]  our drinking water. Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other
[02:30:46.470 --> 02:30:52.590]  disease. With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water and a remedy to this
[02:30:52.590 --> 02:30:56.830]  madness. Available now at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:30:58.109 --> 02:31:02.789]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move against Tucker
[02:31:02.789 --> 02:31:04.029]  Carlson and take him off the air.
[02:31:04.230 --> 02:31:06.430]  People said, no way, he's the most powerful thing that ever happened.
[02:31:06.869 --> 02:31:08.750]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[02:31:09.029 --> 02:31:11.470]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believe they can control him.
[02:31:11.590 --> 02:31:14.509]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[02:31:14.830 --> 02:31:16.269]  It's the same thing with Infowars.
[02:31:16.590 --> 02:31:22.509]  But Infowars is not owned by Fox or controlled by George Soros or owned by Spotify like
[02:31:22.509 --> 02:31:26.189]  Joe Rogan. We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[02:31:27.029 --> 02:31:28.789]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[02:31:29.070 --> 02:31:33.590]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[02:31:33.670 --> 02:31:36.949]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[02:31:37.430 --> 02:31:40.070]  So I want to thank you for your support and encourage viewers and listeners to understand.
[02:31:40.509 --> 02:31:42.830]  Please don't take Infowars for granted.
[02:31:43.150 --> 02:31:44.470]  We're barely hanging on.
[02:31:44.509 --> 02:31:48.029]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support, while getting great

[02:31:56.430 --> 02:31:57.230]  these tyrants.
[02:31:58.830 --> 02:32:01.830]  Infowars, tomorrow's news today.
[02:32:02.150 --> 02:32:03.109]  This is their big move.
[02:32:03.869 --> 02:32:07.310]  So, yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States?
[02:32:07.670 --> 02:32:08.789]  He doesn't care.
[02:32:09.430 --> 02:32:10.590]  That's not his job.
[02:32:10.630 --> 02:32:12.390]  He's not the president of the United States.
[02:32:12.390 --> 02:32:15.109]  He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[02:32:16.230 --> 02:32:20.189]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased.
[02:32:20.789 --> 02:32:22.070]  They must be opposed.
[02:32:22.509 --> 02:32:25.390]  And that's who autocrats only understand one word.
[02:32:25.750 --> 02:32:28.470]  No, no, no.
[02:32:28.590 --> 02:32:32.230]  Exactly. And that's why we say no to your vaccines.
[02:32:33.109 --> 02:32:36.070]  We say no to you shutting down our businesses.
[02:32:36.189 --> 02:32:38.630]  We say no to you taking our firearms.
[02:32:38.670 --> 02:32:41.109]  We say no to you censoring our free speech.
[02:32:41.150 --> 02:32:44.710]  We say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization.
[02:32:44.789 --> 02:32:47.269]  We say no to you getting us into World War Three.
[02:32:47.310 --> 02:32:50.830]  You're right. We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden.
[02:32:50.869 --> 02:32:52.670]  And we say no.
[02:32:52.710 --> 02:32:54.550]  And we say no to your war.
[02:32:58.949 --> 02:33:03.269]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:33:03.509 --> 02:33:05.189]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:06.740 --> 02:33:20.539]  InfoWars.com is tomorrow's news today.
[02:33:20.539 --> 02:33:34.699]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:33:34.699 --> 02:33:39.580]  And we're taking your calls.
[02:33:39.580 --> 02:33:47.780]  Biden vetoes measure repealing D.C. police reform, yeah, and the Democrats also stood
[02:33:47.780 --> 02:33:51.940]  down the National Guard and the D.C. police on January 6th because they wanted it out
[02:33:51.940 --> 02:33:52.940]  of control.
[02:33:52.940 --> 02:33:57.020]  They defund the police, their cities get turned into criminal hellholes, and then they blame
[02:33:57.020 --> 02:33:58.020]  you.
[02:33:58.020 --> 02:33:59.020]  Hilarious.
[02:33:59.020 --> 02:34:00.020]  Look at this.
[02:34:00.020 --> 02:34:04.460]  Dollar Tree plunges after profit tumbles as thieves pillage stores.
[02:34:04.460 --> 02:34:10.300]  Yes, many stores, brick-and-mortar stores, being forced to close because liberal policies
[02:34:10.300 --> 02:34:17.940]  have emboldened criminals to engage in such theft that the stores can't even survive anymore.
[02:34:17.940 --> 02:34:20.820]  And this is what the left has planned for your entire country before they absorb it
[02:34:20.820 --> 02:34:24.420]  into the one world government with the digital currency that they can switch on and off.
[02:34:24.420 --> 02:34:27.840]  And you're going to have to be a good slave if you want to buy or sell.
[02:34:27.840 --> 02:34:29.720]  We go back to the phone lines.
[02:34:29.720 --> 02:34:31.800]  We have Alan in Arkansas.
[02:34:31.800 --> 02:34:33.400]  Alan, you're on the air.
[02:34:33.400 --> 02:34:34.400]  Go ahead.
[02:34:34.400 --> 02:34:35.400]  How you doing, Owen?
[02:34:35.400 --> 02:34:38.600]  You're doing a fine job there.
[02:34:38.600 --> 02:34:39.600]  Thank you.
[02:34:39.600 --> 02:34:47.320]  Yeah, you were speaking about the preachers with all the trans trash going on.
[02:34:47.320 --> 02:34:56.880]  You know, my wife and I, we've listened to Alex for 25 years and back long ago, you know,
[02:34:56.920 --> 02:35:00.480]  you had some lone voices out there.
[02:35:00.480 --> 02:35:07.000]  We text Mars and Pastor Butch Paul, but we confided in them.
[02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:09.119]  We were the only ones.
[02:35:09.119 --> 02:35:18.520]  But back when we really got us going on, it was my oldest son, he was in second grade
[02:35:18.520 --> 02:35:25.760]  and my daughter was in fourth grade, and you have to just go figure the liberal thinking.
[02:35:25.760 --> 02:35:33.440]  I have no idea, but the teacher, Ben, was going to have the kids do a study on China.
[02:35:33.440 --> 02:35:38.880]  So she goes to the public library and gets books off the top shelf and showing bare-breasted
[02:35:38.880 --> 02:35:41.760]  women to the second graders doing a study on China.
[02:35:41.760 --> 02:35:42.760]  I can't figure it.
[02:35:42.760 --> 02:35:50.880]  And then at the same time, in the fourth grade, the teacher there decided to do a Netherlands
[02:35:50.880 --> 02:35:57.600]  nightlife study, and she's showing Netherlands nightlife videos in the fourth grade class,
[02:35:57.600 --> 02:36:00.720]  which are not good to be doing.
[02:36:00.720 --> 02:36:06.760]  But we had a school board meeting, you know, they said, well, we're going to take your
[02:36:06.760 --> 02:36:09.800]  little subject to executive session.
[02:36:09.800 --> 02:36:17.280]  And we just, we come unglued and just ended our portion of their meeting and come to find
[02:36:17.280 --> 02:36:22.320]  out at the same time, all the preachers were having pizza at a pizza joint, never got any
[02:36:22.320 --> 02:36:23.320]  support from them.
[02:36:23.320 --> 02:36:31.640]  But I'm glad, you know, the preachers have been taken out so long ago, you know.
[02:36:31.640 --> 02:36:38.560]  But yeah, we listened to Alex and that was a whole different deal then.
[02:36:38.560 --> 02:36:43.720]  But a lot of the preachers that were on, you know, associated around Alex, they did listen
[02:36:43.720 --> 02:36:47.360]  and had shows on it and were upset as we were.
[02:36:47.360 --> 02:36:49.960]  And a lot of callers called in, they were upset too.
[02:36:49.960 --> 02:36:52.640]  But that was, you know, 30 years ago.
[02:36:52.640 --> 02:36:57.680]  And today, I don't expect them to do much.
[02:36:57.680 --> 02:36:59.400]  They've just enriched themselves.
[02:36:59.400 --> 02:37:00.920]  Oh, sure.
[02:37:00.920 --> 02:37:02.520]  Oh, sure.
[02:37:02.520 --> 02:37:03.520]  Nice and comfortably.
[02:37:03.520 --> 02:37:04.520]  Oh, yeah.
[02:37:04.520 --> 02:37:07.320]  It's a, that just disgusts me.
[02:37:07.320 --> 02:37:13.960]  All these 10 churches and having their little bread and circuses, you know.
[02:37:13.960 --> 02:37:20.760]  But yeah, I ordered some survival shield and turbo force.
[02:37:20.760 --> 02:37:23.800]  I'm anxious to give that a try.
[02:37:23.800 --> 02:37:25.800]  Well, I appreciate that, Alan.
[02:37:25.800 --> 02:37:31.160]  It's your support that keeps us on the air and you will see the results for sure.
[02:37:31.160 --> 02:37:32.160]  Okay.
[02:37:32.160 --> 02:37:33.960]  Well, you keep up the good work, Owen.
[02:37:33.960 --> 02:37:34.960]  Doing fine.
[02:37:34.960 --> 02:37:36.080]  Thank you for the call.
[02:37:36.080 --> 02:37:38.000]  Let's go to Evan in California.
[02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:39.400]  Evan, you're on the air.
[02:37:39.400 --> 02:37:40.400]  Go ahead.
[02:37:40.400 --> 02:37:43.160]  Owen, it's a pleasure to talk to you, my friend.
[02:37:43.160 --> 02:37:45.199]  Hey, I had the pleasure of talking to you once before.
[02:37:45.199 --> 02:37:50.000]  Hey, kind of piggybacking on the last caller, I'm Evan the Evangelist.
[02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:53.960]  And I have a ministry, Jesus Christ Worldwide Ministries.
[02:37:53.960 --> 02:37:55.680]  And the last caller was very accurate.
[02:37:55.680 --> 02:38:00.960]  Most preachers don't really, they just care about a doctrine that women will give money
[02:38:00.960 --> 02:38:01.960]  to.
[02:38:01.960 --> 02:38:05.600]  If you have an edge, it's usually the women that don't want to hear it, have spoken to
[02:38:06.119 --> 02:38:11.080]  a lot of churches where a lot of guys are fired up, but women in church, they don't want
[02:38:11.080 --> 02:38:12.080]  to hear anything fiery.
[02:38:12.080 --> 02:38:18.560]  Well, I'll tell you, over 20 years ago, I talked to Ray Taliaferro, and he pulled some
[02:38:18.560 --> 02:38:23.280]  of this LGBT stuff all the way back then, and I got him kicked off the air.
[02:38:23.280 --> 02:38:30.039]  So you can try to consult people, and if you use the Gospel and if you know the Bible and
[02:38:30.039 --> 02:38:35.280]  you're able to warn people, I was able to get people in the Bay Area to get Ray Taliaferro
[02:38:35.280 --> 02:38:36.280]  kicked off the air.
[02:38:36.280 --> 02:38:40.760]  At the time, he was the number one guy on KGO News Talk radio.
[02:38:40.760 --> 02:38:44.160]  And eventually, I think about a year later, they brought him back.
[02:38:44.160 --> 02:38:49.640]  But I got him to say that God was a homosexual, and that all these people started protesting,
[02:38:49.640 --> 02:38:51.880]  and I started calling him with different voices and stuff.
[02:38:51.880 --> 02:38:55.760]  And long story short, I got the guy kicked off the air.
[02:38:55.760 --> 02:38:57.960]  So you can be a minister like me.
[02:38:57.960 --> 02:39:02.880]  I have a Jesus Christ Worldwide Ministries, jcwm1.com.
[02:39:02.880 --> 02:39:03.880]  I'm a dude.
[02:39:03.880 --> 02:39:04.880]  I work for a living.
[02:39:04.880 --> 02:39:10.199]  If anybody gives me money, I try to promote Alex Jones, who watches my videos.
[02:39:10.199 --> 02:39:14.280]  I believe Alex Jones is the biggest, most effective preacher of the Gospel on planet
[02:39:14.280 --> 02:39:20.360]  Earth, and I believe, Owen, you're number two, because when you are talking to and you're
[02:39:20.360 --> 02:39:24.680]  confronting an audience with the reality of this world, and then you, you know, give an
[02:39:24.680 --> 02:39:30.720]  homage or give a shout-out to God, that's all God really asks to start to turn things around.
[02:39:30.720 --> 02:39:35.280]  And I've talked to Alex a couple times, and I was trying to make a point that even though
[02:39:35.280 --> 02:39:40.840]  it might seem a little unsecular, I believe info wars should dedicate one day to Jesus
[02:39:40.840 --> 02:39:48.119]  Christ, have ministers on, and do spiritual battle, because I literally do consider Alex
[02:39:48.119 --> 02:39:52.440]  number one and you number two, and I'm probably number 80 million.
[02:39:52.440 --> 02:39:56.760]  Well let me just pause you right there, and maybe we can even get, you said you're Evan
[02:39:56.760 --> 02:39:57.760]  the Evangelist.
[02:39:57.760 --> 02:39:59.440]  I don't know if you've got a YouTube channel or something we can promote here, but let
[02:39:59.480 --> 02:40:04.960]  me just, let me just stop you right there and kind of explain this a little bit more.
[02:40:04.960 --> 02:40:10.960]  I look at somebody like Pastor Arthur Pawlowski in Canada, who's probably been arrested like
[02:40:10.960 --> 02:40:16.360]  half a dozen or more times now for standing up against tyranny and calling it out.
[02:40:16.360 --> 02:40:22.760]  Why aren't there thousands of preachers and pastors like that in North America?
[02:40:22.760 --> 02:40:24.000]  There aren't.
[02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:29.039]  Why aren't there thousands of preachers like Pastor Greg Locke or David Scarlett?
[02:40:29.039 --> 02:40:34.199]  I mean it's just, it's too far, few and far between, but let me get in directly what you're
[02:40:34.199 --> 02:40:36.840]  referencing now with me.
[02:40:36.840 --> 02:40:40.760]  I never claimed to be a religious activist.
[02:40:40.760 --> 02:40:46.680]  I don't try to bring religion onto these transmissions, I mean we do, it's inevitable, we're facing
[02:40:46.680 --> 02:40:51.760]  evil spirits now and demons, it's clear, and we are Christians here, and I do believe
[02:40:51.760 --> 02:40:57.240]  in God, and I do, I mean anybody that denies creation to me is just like, it just blows
[02:40:57.240 --> 02:40:58.240]  my mind.
[02:40:58.240 --> 02:40:59.240]  How can you not see the creation?
[02:40:59.240 --> 02:41:01.560]  This is, we're all in a divine creation right now.
[02:41:01.560 --> 02:41:07.160]  But here's why I've been more inclined to put pressure, and that's what it really is,
[02:41:07.160 --> 02:41:12.640]  to put pressure on the Christian church and the Christian body to get active, because I'm
[02:41:12.640 --> 02:41:13.640]  just not seeing it.
[02:41:13.640 --> 02:41:21.720]  But what I am seeing is this, this like moral competition from the American right, specifically
[02:41:21.720 --> 02:41:26.480]  the Christian American right, where they expect everybody to live purest lives, and they expect
[02:41:26.480 --> 02:41:30.640]  everybody to live life how they expect them to live it, and I'm just sitting here, hey,
[02:41:30.640 --> 02:41:34.160]  you know that's fine, I think that's an unfair expectation, but I understand where you're
[02:41:34.160 --> 02:41:38.880]  coming from as a Christian, okay, but where are you in the field?
[02:41:38.880 --> 02:41:44.200]  Where are you standing up against the children being targeted for genital mutilation?
[02:41:44.200 --> 02:41:48.760]  Where are you standing up against the innocent children that are going to be snuffed out
[02:41:48.760 --> 02:41:50.080]  in the womb?
[02:41:50.080 --> 02:41:54.279]  Where are you standing up when it comes to the mark of the beast, and the digital currency,
[02:41:54.279 --> 02:41:56.200]  and the forced vaccinations?
[02:41:56.200 --> 02:41:57.520]  I'm just not seeing it.
[02:41:57.520 --> 02:42:00.000]  So I see plenty of moral police out there.
[02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:05.320]  I see plenty of moral police out there, but that's still a comfort zone.
[02:42:05.320 --> 02:42:10.240]  You know, I just have a problem with the moral police that won't even bust a grape
[02:42:10.240 --> 02:42:15.320]  in this political fruit fight, if you will, for the soul of America.
[02:42:15.320 --> 02:42:21.360]  Well, you know, I laugh at this, but you know, if you read the Bible, God uses the people
[02:42:21.360 --> 02:42:25.880]  that weren't expected to be used, and I said this once to Alex Jones, and I didn't mean
[02:42:25.880 --> 02:42:31.640]  to be offensive to him, is that he's a whiskey drinking man of faith, and I would rather
[02:42:31.640 --> 02:42:33.680]  listen to him because he's real.
[02:42:33.680 --> 02:42:38.279]  So you and Alex have righteous indignation, and that's what people should start looking
[02:42:38.279 --> 02:42:41.800]  for in a minister, that he doesn't have righteous indignation.
[02:42:41.800 --> 02:42:43.240]  He's not alive.
[02:42:43.240 --> 02:42:44.240]  He's not alive.
[02:42:44.240 --> 02:42:49.720]  And I hate to say this again, but kind of the Joel Osteen church, I'm not hearing them
[02:42:49.720 --> 02:42:51.119]  come against evil.
[02:42:51.119 --> 02:42:56.400]  They're just agreeing with, you know, people sitting on the fence.
[02:42:56.400 --> 02:42:57.400]  Hey.
[02:42:57.400 --> 02:43:01.440]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[02:43:01.440 --> 02:43:03.520]  Please write this down and please go look this up.
[02:43:03.520 --> 02:43:05.560]  It will change your life.
[02:43:05.560 --> 02:43:10.039]  The U.N. admits, and the Lansing Medical Journal admits, that upwards of two billion people
[02:43:10.039 --> 02:43:14.279]  have mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities.
[02:43:14.279 --> 02:43:19.800]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[02:43:19.800 --> 02:43:24.640]  Most iodine in the environment is bound to other elements, so your body can't absorb
[02:43:24.640 --> 02:43:25.640]  it.
[02:43:25.640 --> 02:43:29.840]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[02:43:29.840 --> 02:43:36.119]  And Infowarestore.com has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of full
[02:43:36.119 --> 02:43:37.119]  effect.
[02:43:37.119 --> 02:43:39.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3's been sold out for six months.
[02:43:39.960 --> 02:43:42.960]  It's very hard to produce, and it's finally back in stock.
[02:43:42.960 --> 02:43:45.960]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.

[02:43:48.140 --> 02:43:49.440]  You and your family need it.
[02:43:49.440 --> 02:43:51.920]  It's 25% off, back in stock.

[02:43:58.800 --> 02:44:01.440]  There is a war for the future happening right now.
[02:44:01.440 --> 02:44:06.320]  There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny, our children's destinies.
[02:44:06.320 --> 02:44:10.320]  And that war is something that we can win, but it takes dedication.
[02:44:10.320 --> 02:44:11.680]  It takes commitment.
[02:44:11.680 --> 02:44:15.960]  That's why I ask listeners, respectfully, to go to Infowarestore.com and buy great

[02:45:28.920 --> 02:45:29.920]  Keep doing it.
[02:45:29.920 --> 02:45:30.920]  But most viewers and listeners never go to Infowarestore.com, and you never buy great
[02:45:30.920 --> 02:45:31.920]  products that enrich and empower your life, while at the same time keeping us on air.
[02:45:31.920 --> 02:45:32.920]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at Infowarestore.com.
[02:45:32.920 --> 02:45:33.920]  If just 1% more of you go to Infowarestore.com, you're going to have a great day.
[02:45:33.920 --> 02:45:34.920]  Thank you.
[02:45:34.920 --> 02:45:35.920]  Thank you.
[02:45:35.920 --> 02:45:36.920]  Thank you.
[02:45:36.920 --> 02:45:37.920]  Thank you.
[02:45:37.920 --> 02:45:38.920]  Thank you.
[02:45:38.920 --> 02:45:39.920]  Thank you.
[02:45:39.920 --> 02:45:40.920]  Thank you.
[02:45:40.920 --> 02:45:41.920]  Thank you.
[02:45:41.920 --> 02:45:42.920]  Thank you.
[02:45:42.920 --> 02:45:43.920]  Thank you.
[02:45:43.920 --> 02:45:44.920]  Thank you.
[02:45:44.920 --> 02:45:45.920]  Thank you.
[02:45:45.920 --> 02:45:46.920]  Thank you.
[02:45:46.920 --> 02:45:47.920]  Thank you.
[02:45:47.920 --> 02:45:48.920]  Thank you.
[02:45:48.920 --> 02:45:49.920]  Thank you.
[02:45:49.920 --> 02:45:50.920]  Thank you.
[02:45:50.920 --> 02:45:51.920]  We love you.
[02:45:51.920 --> 02:46:02.920]  This is Adam King, host of the Adam King Show, joined by the one and only Greg Reese of
[02:46:02.920 --> 02:46:03.920]  The Reese Report.
[02:46:03.920 --> 02:46:07.220]  We wanted to hop on and send everybody to Infowarestore.com.
[02:46:07.220 --> 02:46:11.740]  Click this QR code right above Greg Reese, buy yourself a Faraday cage—
[02:46:12.560 --> 02:46:15.560]  super male vitality, or what Greg has.
[02:46:15.560 --> 02:46:17.000]  Greg, what do you got there?
[02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:21.340]  If you really want to treat yourself to something nice, get yourself an Alexa Pure water filter
[02:46:21.340 --> 02:46:26.039]  and get clean, healthy water whenever you want it, wherever you want it.
[02:46:26.039 --> 02:46:31.480]  Even if the water pressure goes out, the Gravity Fed water filter has got you covered.
[02:46:31.480 --> 02:46:33.060]  Absolutely.
[02:46:33.060 --> 02:46:38.119]  And we couldn't do any of this without listener support.
[02:46:38.119 --> 02:46:41.039]  I was telling Greg earlier, we're like the real NPR.
[02:46:41.039 --> 02:46:42.779]  The real NPR of the base, right?
[02:46:42.779 --> 02:46:45.860]  So click that QR code right there on your screen right now.
[02:46:45.860 --> 02:46:46.860]  Take out your phone.
[02:46:46.860 --> 02:46:47.860]  Click that QR code.
[02:46:47.860 --> 02:46:50.020]  It'll take you directly to Infowarestore.com.
[02:46:50.020 --> 02:46:51.140]  Buy something.
[02:46:51.140 --> 02:46:52.140]  Support the Infowar.
[02:46:52.140 --> 02:46:55.700]  Keep Alex Jones, Lauren Troyer, Harrison Smith, Greg Reese, Adam King, and the rest of us on
[02:46:55.700 --> 02:46:56.700]  air.
[02:46:56.700 --> 02:46:57.700]  Do it today.
[02:46:57.700 --> 02:46:58.700]  Do it now.
[02:46:58.700 --> 02:46:59.700]  Support the Infowar.
[02:46:59.700 --> 02:47:06.180]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:11.039 --> 02:47:41.020]  Holy Diver, you've been down too long in the midnight sea of what's becoming of me.
[02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:48.200]  All right, final segment of your phone calls, and then I'm going to show you that video
[02:47:48.200 --> 02:47:55.320]  I teased in the first five minutes of the next hour, followed by Jay Dyer from Jay's
[02:47:55.320 --> 02:47:56.320]  Analysis.
[02:47:56.320 --> 02:47:57.320]  We're still taking your calls, though.
[02:47:57.320 --> 02:48:00.720]  So let's go to J-Row in Georgia.
[02:48:00.720 --> 02:48:02.360]  J-Row, you're on the air.
[02:48:02.360 --> 02:48:03.360]  Go ahead.
[02:48:03.360 --> 02:48:05.360]  What's going on, Owen Troyer, man?
[02:48:05.360 --> 02:48:06.920]  Glad to be on with you today.
[02:48:06.920 --> 02:48:08.760]  I spoke with you last year.
[02:48:08.760 --> 02:48:10.400]  I'm an eight-year Marine Corps veteran.
[02:48:10.779 --> 02:48:15.740]  I served six and a half years in the Air Force, and we talked about the storm and being sheepdog.
[02:48:15.740 --> 02:48:19.980]  I don't know if you remember that conversation, but either way, this is now, the storm is
[02:48:19.980 --> 02:48:22.220]  no longer off the shore.
[02:48:22.220 --> 02:48:27.100]  It is now on shore, and so I don't know, and I'm with you on this, Christian.
[02:48:27.100 --> 02:48:28.100]  I'm a born-again Christian.
[02:48:28.100 --> 02:48:33.900]  I actually, since I talked to you last year, started a Facebook movement called Third Day
[02:48:33.900 --> 02:48:34.900]  Warriors.
[02:48:34.900 --> 02:48:39.860]  We're on Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and I go live Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, 7.30
[02:48:39.860 --> 02:48:43.680]  p.m. Eastern Standard Time, the monkey stopped that devil, because I can tell you the reason
[02:48:43.680 --> 02:48:47.920]  why you're not seeing activity from any Christians or so-called religious organizations, because
[02:48:47.920 --> 02:48:48.920]  that's what they are.
[02:48:48.920 --> 02:48:50.920]  They're religious organizations.
[02:48:50.920 --> 02:48:52.860]  They don't want to do anything with change.
[02:48:52.860 --> 02:48:57.600]  They want to take, take, take, and build their kingdoms, and it's time out for that lukewarm,
[02:48:57.600 --> 02:49:02.520]  you know, gummy bear Christianity that we see, and I'm with you 100 percent, brother.
[02:49:02.520 --> 02:49:07.680]  I'm telling you right now, there needs to be a clarion call to the church as a whole,
[02:49:07.680 --> 02:49:11.619]  to the remnant warriors of the kingdom of God, who are going to take a stand.
[02:49:11.619 --> 02:49:15.460]  The reason why we're not going to win kinetically, the reason we're not going to win with a
[02:49:15.460 --> 02:49:19.260]  kinetic fight, though, and our weapons of warfare are not carnal, but they are mighty
[02:49:19.260 --> 02:49:24.340]  through God, to the pulling down of these strongholds, and our weapons of warfare are
[02:49:24.340 --> 02:49:28.300]  this, prayer, praise, and worship.
[02:49:28.300 --> 02:49:33.420]  Those three things will break down the divide between any religious ideology, any of this
[02:49:33.420 --> 02:49:38.000]  denominational bullcrap that's out there, all these lies that separates it, because
[02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:44.080]  those three things bring the presence of God into not only your life, but will do it into
[02:49:44.080 --> 02:49:49.360]  your home, into our nation, and around this globe, and if we as Christians don't stand
[02:49:49.360 --> 02:49:55.200]  up and start praying, praising, and worshiping, stop arguing, get out there and do it in
[02:49:55.200 --> 02:49:56.200]  the streets.
[02:49:56.200 --> 02:50:01.039]  I went to Target yesterday, Hammer, in Georgia, and they don't have the display up yet.
[02:50:01.039 --> 02:50:04.100]  There was a few things in there, but you better believe, come June 1st, I'm going
[02:50:04.100 --> 02:50:08.500]  back in there, and we're going to expose it again, but I did a video yesterday, as
[02:50:08.500 --> 02:50:13.340]  a Christian, as a warrior, without my community, just yesterday, and filmed that, and it's
[02:50:13.340 --> 02:50:18.980]  uploaded on Facebook under J-Row, but listen, Owen, you're exactly right, and I couldn't
[02:50:18.980 --> 02:50:20.340]  agree more.
[02:50:20.340 --> 02:50:25.380]  The Christian warriors, the community, needs to get up out of the pew, and start going
[02:50:25.380 --> 02:50:31.020]  out and engaging the enemy with our weapons of warfare, not, listen, this LGBT community
[02:50:31.020 --> 02:50:36.520]  thing is to get the Christians to then do something kinetically, it's just a microcosm
[02:50:36.520 --> 02:50:40.160]  of what you and I both know that's coming, greater than just that.
[02:50:40.160 --> 02:50:41.160]  That is an issue.
[02:50:41.160 --> 02:50:46.400]  It's straight demonic, and if we have identified the fact that this is the enemy, it's the
[02:50:46.400 --> 02:50:50.880]  devil, then the only answer to that is Jesus Christ, the blood of the Lamb, and the word
[02:50:50.880 --> 02:50:54.840]  of our testimony, and I'm telling you right now, if the Christian community don't get
[02:50:54.840 --> 02:50:59.760]  up and start standing up now, this is the clarion call, I'm telling you right now,
[02:51:00.220 --> 02:51:04.500]  we're gonna lose our nation, the southern border's under attack, this is all to set
[02:51:04.500 --> 02:51:09.460]  up for the United Nations, Owen Schroeder, to come in and police the streets of America,
[02:51:09.460 --> 02:51:15.300]  and if we don't stand up now, and do something, that'll be happening by 2024 to 2025.
[02:51:15.300 --> 02:51:21.580]  100%, I would say by 2025, we really got a shot to turn this thing around peacefully
[02:51:21.580 --> 02:51:27.140]  and politically, and after that, it's gonna be a lot harder, because they do have the
[02:51:27.140 --> 02:51:32.680]  digital currency ready to go, and everything else falls in line from there, folks.
[02:51:32.680 --> 02:51:33.880]  Everything else falls in line from there.
[02:51:33.880 --> 02:51:37.200]  If they get you on the digital currency, you're a slave.
[02:51:37.200 --> 02:51:41.440]  They'll turn off your digital currency, they'll turn off your access to buy and sell, that's
[02:51:41.440 --> 02:51:44.640]  why they're trying to buy up all the farmland, that's why they're trying to make it illegal
[02:51:44.640 --> 02:51:48.200]  to be self-sufficient and independent in all these different ways, and I'll also tell
[02:51:48.200 --> 02:51:57.039]  you this, J-Roe, I'm getting, I don't know, maybe some pushback, support, I'm getting
[02:51:57.039 --> 02:52:02.660]  major vibrations on this little stump that I've decided to take here about Christian
[02:52:02.660 --> 02:52:03.660]  activism.
[02:52:03.660 --> 02:52:09.860]  I've gotten major, major pushback, support, whatever, in the last 48 to 72 hours, and
[02:52:09.860 --> 02:52:15.100]  I'm just gonna tell you this, we're moving this ball forward, and we've got plans to
[02:52:15.100 --> 02:52:18.820]  move this ball forward now, we're working on some things here to really move this ball
[02:52:18.820 --> 02:52:27.020]  forward in the month of June, because it has to be done, it just, it has to be done,
[02:52:27.020 --> 02:52:33.020]  and I know that there are people out there that want to see the rubber meet the road
[02:52:33.020 --> 02:52:37.820]  when it comes to these issues, and so it's time to mobilize, it's time to activate, and
[02:52:37.820 --> 02:52:39.860]  I'm seeing a positive response to that.
[02:52:39.860 --> 02:52:44.700]  Amen, and I couldn't agree more, and I'm glad, I'm thankful to God that you are using your
[02:52:44.700 --> 02:52:49.700]  platform to engage and challenge the Christian community as a whole, because we know there's
[02:52:49.700 --> 02:52:54.940]  hope, we know that, and I'll say it as an American, I'll say it as a Marine, I understand
[02:52:54.940 --> 02:52:59.619]  kinetic warfare, you do too, you may not have been in it physically, but you understand
[02:52:59.619 --> 02:53:04.340]  it from a philosophical standpoint, we don't win kinetically, we know what that turns into
[02:53:04.340 --> 02:53:08.820]  January 6th, we know what it turns into, so for everybody always calls into the show
[02:53:08.820 --> 02:53:12.700]  and asks, well what can we do, well I'll tell you what you can do, if it's demonic, you
[02:53:12.700 --> 02:53:17.140]  do what God said to do, you pray, praise and worship, we humble ourselves, seek His face.
[02:53:17.140 --> 02:53:22.460]  I was able to talk to Alex too a few months ago, and the last caller mentioned it, and
[02:53:22.460 --> 02:53:27.100]  had talked to him about, and not a religious show, because we're not talking about denomination,
[02:53:27.100 --> 02:53:31.779]  we're not talking about the ideology, we're talking about relationship and life in Christ,
[02:53:31.779 --> 02:53:35.980]  and you're exactly right, that doesn't come with laws and stipulations, that comes with
[02:53:35.980 --> 02:53:41.340]  love and standing and being bold, but love ain't weak, love is not accepting of everybody,
[02:53:41.340 --> 02:53:45.460]  love is loving God and worshiping Him and letting Him fight the battle, and so I believe
[02:53:45.460 --> 02:53:49.420]  there needs to be a show, you know, and when I brought it up, he took the number, but however,
[02:53:49.420 --> 02:53:52.619]  I decided let's go ahead and do it on Facebook, let's just do it anyway.
[02:53:52.619 --> 02:53:58.500]  Bingo, yep, that's how it's done, that's how it's done, J. Rowe, thank you for the call,
[02:53:58.500 --> 02:54:01.660]  there's gonna be more on this, alright, there's gonna be more on this next month folks, trust
[02:54:01.660 --> 02:54:10.900]  me, trust me, this thing ain't going anywhere, this is long overdue, I mean, I said it the
[02:54:10.900 --> 02:54:15.460]  other day, and I'll just say it again, I mean, it's just like every single time, it's
[02:54:15.460 --> 02:54:20.619]  just like it always has to be info wars, I said it with the real world activism over
[02:54:20.619 --> 02:54:25.700]  the internet activism, I'm talking about it now of getting Christians off the bench and
[02:54:25.700 --> 02:54:31.140]  into the field, so this is gonna happen, and if it always has to be info wars, then fine,
[02:54:31.140 --> 02:54:36.539]  so be it, but that's why they want us off the air so badly, because it is us, we are the
[02:54:36.539 --> 02:54:41.300]  nucleus of the resistance to tyranny, it's just the fact that all energy stems from this
[02:54:41.300 --> 02:54:46.180]  audience, this crew, this is it, they know it, that's why they've targeted us for destruction,
[02:54:46.180 --> 02:54:47.180]  absolutely.
[02:54:47.180 --> 02:54:53.580]  Alright, let's take one more call here, let's see, boy, a lot of great callers, how about
[02:54:53.580 --> 02:54:56.820]  Oliver in Pennsylvania, Oliver, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:54:56.820 --> 02:55:03.140]  Hey, how you doing, Owen, okay, uh, it's, uh, Joe's been in office, it's costing us
[02:55:03.140 --> 02:55:11.420]  about $600 for a month just to live, water, electric, Walmart, food prices, unbelievable,
[02:55:11.420 --> 02:55:19.980]  gas prices, gas prices, you name it, taxes, everything's up, up, up, and they tell us
[02:55:19.980 --> 02:55:24.820]  everything's good, good, good, the PSC bank today, I stopped there, and they said, hey,
[02:55:24.820 --> 02:55:29.060]  you and your wife want to come in and discuss some finances, I get your stocks down over
[02:55:29.060 --> 02:55:34.740]  30%, I don't want to talk nothing to you people, you know, what are you going to do, take my
[02:55:34.740 --> 02:55:36.980]  money and lose that, too?
[02:55:36.980 --> 02:55:41.820]  You know, most people don't understand politics or they're disinterested, but they know money.
[02:55:41.820 --> 02:55:48.180]  Yeah, they know how, the banks know how to lose it, and you can hand it back to them for
[02:55:48.180 --> 02:55:54.300]  nothing, but that's all I got to say about that, take care, Owen, have a good Memorial
[02:55:54.300 --> 02:55:55.300]  Day weekend.
[02:55:55.300 --> 02:56:01.060]  Hey, thank you, and, and, I mean, I'm going to take one more quick call, but folks, I'm
[02:56:01.060 --> 02:56:07.340]  just telling you, uh, I know a lot of people, I, I got a lot of friends, a lot of them are
[02:56:07.340 --> 02:56:13.500]  politically neutral, apolitical, don't care, they get how everything has been worse under
[02:56:13.500 --> 02:56:20.860]  Joe Biden, like, it's so obvious, everybody gets it, they might not fully understand the,
[02:56:20.860 --> 02:56:25.860]  the depth, but at the surface, they know, all right, William in California, you're on
[02:56:25.860 --> 02:56:34.100]  the air, go ahead, do we have, yes, William, go ahead.
[02:56:34.100 --> 02:56:39.380]  Hi, Owen, honored to speak with you, sir, I love your work, I love Alex's work, you

[02:59:49.180 --> 02:59:55.260]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:59:57.940 --> 03:00:18.940]  How do you feel about this, Chasten Bootyjudge, the husband of Pete Bootyjudge, is doing a
[03:00:18.940 --> 03:00:25.820]  book tour, and he's going to churches to promote the LGBTQ agenda, and convince children to
[03:00:25.820 --> 03:00:30.380]  be gay, he was recently at Central Presbyterian, right here in Austin, that's what the churches
[03:00:30.380 --> 03:00:34.900]  are doing here, standing up against the forced vaccines, and the digital currencies, pushing
[03:00:34.900 --> 03:00:42.340]  back against the trans kids, I'm not sure, we got to hear Chasten Bootyjudge speak first.
[03:00:42.340 --> 03:00:49.940]  This happened in Olympia, Washington, Timothy Lassley was filming this, and a little protest,
[03:00:49.940 --> 03:01:00.420]  in fact, let me make sure I get the quote right here, from Timothy, in the video, because
[03:01:00.420 --> 03:01:09.580]  it makes sense, no commies, no pedophiles, no child sacrifice, so that's their chant,
[03:01:09.580 --> 03:01:14.220]  that's their calling, no commies, no pedophiles, no child sacrifice, well who would be against
[03:01:14.220 --> 03:01:20.340]  that? Who could possibly be for commies, or for pedophiles, or for child sacrifice? You'd
[03:01:20.340 --> 03:01:25.820]  be stunned, you want to see how brainwashing works? You want to see how MKUltra mind control
[03:01:25.820 --> 03:01:31.619]  works? Watch the responses as this group of peaceful activists chant no commies, no pedophiles,
[03:01:31.619 --> 03:01:36.119]  and no child sacrifice in the streets, how do you think the left responds in the state
[03:01:36.119 --> 03:01:53.960]  of Washington? Check this out. So you're a Nazi, you're a Nazi if you don't like child sacrifice,
[03:01:53.960 --> 03:02:00.600]  you're a Nazi if you don't like pedophiles, look at the MKUltra mind control brainwashing in real
[03:05:00.600 --> 03:05:27.960]  time, no commies, no pedophiles, no child sacrifice, no commies, no pedophiles, no child
[03:06:00.600 --> 03:06:24.279]  sacrifice, no commies, no child sacrifice, no pedophiles, no child sacrifice, no child
[03:06:25.000 --> 03:06:30.600]  as well as a host of other prominent individuals, speakers, activists, artists, musicians, Jimmy
[03:06:30.600 --> 03:06:35.480]  Levy will be there and so you can get the tickets over if you go to my website you can see the links
[03:06:35.480 --> 03:06:40.680]  there for the Rebels for Cause event. Today we're going to talk about another one of these big old
[03:06:40.680 --> 03:06:46.520]  dusty boring global elite tomes that I actually went and read so that you don't have to. So this
[03:06:46.520 --> 03:06:52.600]  is what I do is I help you out and do your homework for you and you get a global education
[03:06:53.400 --> 03:07:00.279]  by the global elite for globalist purposes, well not for globalist purposes I said that wrong,
[03:07:00.279 --> 03:07:07.320]  you get a free education in the writings of the global elite at an international globalist level
[03:07:07.320 --> 03:07:12.520]  for anti-globalist people. Fridoff Copra is important because he's one of the
[03:07:13.800 --> 03:07:19.000]  green guys right he's a big promoter of the green agenda the climate stuff and getting back to
[03:07:19.960 --> 03:07:26.920]  so-called indigenous earth religions indigenous attitudes towards living in harmony with nature
[03:07:26.920 --> 03:07:30.520]  this kind of stuff all of which kind of sounds neat on the surface but actually
[03:07:31.400 --> 03:07:38.920]  is promoted by a corporate agenda. That corporate agenda is the agenda that we have been seeing
[03:07:38.920 --> 03:07:45.000]  rolled out not just in terms of the great reset but for decades going back to the 1970s and 80s
[03:07:45.400 --> 03:07:52.920]  with the push by the first global revolution book by the club of rome which is pushing austerity
[03:07:52.920 --> 03:07:59.400]  pushing this whole idea of a great reset model even before the great reset we need to return to
[03:07:59.400 --> 03:08:05.080]  some kind of quasi-primitivist archaic revival situation where we no longer have private
[03:08:05.080 --> 03:08:11.640]  property we no longer rely on fossil fuels of course fossil fuels is I mean that relies on
[03:08:11.640 --> 03:08:16.680]  the idea that that oil is crushed up dinosaur bones which is a ridiculous theory in my view
[03:08:17.240 --> 03:08:22.600]  I don't know what oil is but I don't believe it's fossils that's ridiculous whatever it is it's
[03:08:22.600 --> 03:08:26.040]  actually something that comes from the earth I don't know if you know that but it's not it's not
[03:08:26.040 --> 03:08:34.680]  a completely toxic creation that was masterminded by oil companies to destroy the planet now
[03:08:34.680 --> 03:08:39.000]  obviously a lot of the giant oil corporations anglo-iranian oil company these kinds of things
[03:08:39.000 --> 03:08:43.960]  they are globalist entities standard oil rocket pillars and all that so that's definitely part of
[03:08:44.520 --> 03:08:47.320]  the power structure but one thing you have to understand is a lot of the
[03:08:47.880 --> 03:08:54.920]  so-called environmental movements the the push for radical eco agendas they're actually funded by
[03:08:54.920 --> 03:09:00.600]  giant oil conglomerates and energy corporations did you know that did you think that all of the
[03:09:00.920 --> 03:09:05.400]  the astroturf protesting the extinction rebellion the
[03:09:06.760 --> 03:09:11.560]  PETA all these kinds of vegan movements they're not organic movements
[03:09:13.480 --> 03:09:18.600]  they're movements fostered and foisted upon us by the fortune 100 fortune 500
[03:09:19.240 --> 03:09:23.320]  and you know for many years I got a lot of flack for criticizing
[03:09:23.320 --> 03:09:29.240]  corporatism and the fortune 100 fortune 500 so I was making this criticism back in the in the
[03:09:29.240 --> 03:09:34.920]  early 2000s because it was obvious to me that a lot of this agenda is not being pushed by ground
[03:09:34.920 --> 03:09:41.320]  level commies they're just one angle one element of this system a lot of this agenda is being pushed
[03:09:41.320 --> 03:09:48.040]  by the fortune 100 and I remember in the 90s in the early 2000s it was a big deal when certain
[03:09:48.040 --> 03:09:53.800]  giant corporations were beginning to push the skittles agenda and it was evident back then
[03:09:53.800 --> 03:10:00.119]  that there's something coordinated with this it's not just organic movements of low-level
[03:10:00.119 --> 03:10:06.200]  activists they play a role right but there's also pressure from above pressure from above and
[03:10:06.200 --> 03:10:12.680]  pressure from below is actually part of this strategy of change future shock social engineering
[03:10:12.680 --> 03:10:16.600]  right this is what change agents engage in and there's change agents at the corporate level as
[03:10:16.600 --> 03:10:22.920]  well as at the groundswell level but a lot of it is engineered a lot of it is co-opted and it's all
[03:10:23.560 --> 03:10:29.960]  resting on a lot of propaganda that comes from certain ideological pushers ideological figures
[03:10:29.960 --> 03:10:35.960]  and Friedhof copper is one of those key figures and many many years ago in 1982 he wrote a book
[03:10:35.960 --> 03:10:44.520]  called the turning point turning point is a book about the revolutions that were occurring in
[03:10:44.520 --> 03:10:51.320]  science society and culture and he's one of these key figures again uh I don't remember exactly what
[03:10:51.640 --> 03:11:00.439]  his ideological background was but this was being pushed by all of the establishment in 1982 because
[03:11:00.439 --> 03:11:08.840]  this was a move away from western uh repressive oppressive structures they said and it's very
[03:11:08.840 --> 03:11:14.520]  similar to another book that came out right around the same time that has the similar ideology that
[03:11:14.520 --> 03:11:19.880]  a lot of people point out was actually pushed by the tavistock institute and stanford research
[03:11:19.880 --> 03:11:24.840]  and that is the aquarium conspiracy book by marilyn ferguson now these are not conspiracy
[03:11:24.840 --> 03:11:30.279]  texts even though the book is titled the aquarium conspiracy it's not a conspiracy book dr john
[03:11:30.279 --> 03:11:34.119]  coleman argues by the way that it wasn't really written by marilyn ferguson but it was in fact
[03:11:34.119 --> 03:11:39.080]  written by the willis harman and the people that wrote changing images of man another one of these
[03:11:39.080 --> 03:11:46.760]  key white papers that set the step the the the stage set the tone for the turning point this
[03:11:46.760 --> 03:11:53.960]  era post 70s early 80s where we would have radical transformation in society and in the
[03:11:53.960 --> 03:12:02.680]  corporate world this was a book actually targeted at structures of society ceos educators board
[03:12:02.680 --> 03:12:11.000]  members and how they can start to link up in new networks that can bring about this aquarium age of
[03:12:11.000 --> 03:12:16.920]  change one of the key texts beyond the aquarium conspiracy as we said is fritoff coppers book
[03:12:16.920 --> 03:12:21.480]  and when we look at what the philosophy of this text is we're going to find out a lot of fascinating
[03:12:21.480 --> 03:12:28.040]  things now the subtitle of the book as i said deals with science society and culture but he
[03:12:28.040 --> 03:12:32.439]  wrote another book prior to this called the dowel of physics and in that book he was interested in
[03:12:32.439 --> 03:12:40.200]  promoting under the guise of the new physics or uh quantum physics he was interested in promoting
[03:12:40.200 --> 03:12:49.800]  the idea of daoism right now i'm not critiquing eastern philosophies in total i'm sure there's
[03:12:49.800 --> 03:12:54.680]  some really good insights i've read some on eastern philosophy but you can immediately see
[03:12:54.680 --> 03:13:00.600]  that what uh the purpose that copra has in co-opting far eastern philosophies is he says
[03:13:00.600 --> 03:13:05.320]  that we need to look at eastern philosophies because they're holistic they place everything
[03:13:05.320 --> 03:13:10.360]  in the context of the collective and those are going to be a lot more useful for the future that
[03:13:10.360 --> 03:13:16.360]  we're going into which will be collectivist so even though he's not necessarily a communist
[03:13:16.360 --> 03:13:22.840]  or an outright marxist he's a collectivist in the sense that in turning point he says we've got
[03:13:22.840 --> 03:13:29.160]  to look at the way that other eastern philosophies and systems like daoism or confucianism see
[03:13:29.160 --> 03:13:34.200]  everything as a whole and if you see everything as a whole this will diminish the idea of the
[03:13:34.200 --> 03:13:41.800]  particular the individual the one the one in the many in fact he says the best way to conceive of
[03:13:41.800 --> 03:13:49.400]  this is that you are a cell that exists in mother gaia mother gaia the earth is a living creature
[03:13:49.400 --> 03:13:55.080]  you're a cell in that living creature and you're kind of going to be recycled and all of society
[03:13:55.080 --> 03:14:01.560]  all of reality participates in this natural cycle death life rebirth and so forth kind of a
[03:14:01.560 --> 03:14:06.760]  reincarnation type of idea even though it's not necessarily actual reincarnation he just thinks
[03:14:06.760 --> 03:14:11.240]  that we kind of get recycled in this giant engine of gaia or the universe or whatever
[03:14:12.040 --> 03:14:17.400]  and he says that uh when we understand that we can begin to move towards the ideas of a circular
[03:14:17.400 --> 03:14:24.279]  economy and being uh trained to accept re recycling because it damages mother earth
[03:14:25.240 --> 03:14:30.840]  he says this is the system's view of life and he actually cites one of the other global elite texts
[03:14:30.840 --> 03:14:37.000]  that we've referred to many times ghost in the machine by arthur kessler and goes to the machine
[03:14:37.000 --> 03:14:43.640]  as we said was a book that deals with this whole idea of a system's view of life and philosophy
[03:14:43.640 --> 03:14:50.119]  where you're just a cog in the wheel of nature and since that's your proper place you need to
[03:14:50.119 --> 03:14:56.439]  abide by the rules of nature which are that you as an individual are totally subject to the whole
[03:14:56.439 --> 03:15:03.240]  to the collective and the argument they make is look at life life forms look at plants look at the
[03:15:03.240 --> 03:15:10.920]  animal ecosystems they all exist as a whole a whole lawn is what kessler calls it and by the way
[03:15:10.920 --> 03:15:16.920]  copra cites kessler in many many places thank you for fading me into gaia there
[03:15:17.320 --> 03:15:23.400]  uh she has two different colored pupils interesting um
[03:15:25.320 --> 03:15:31.720]  systems then are webs and networks and we should view all of life as webs and networks and so since
[03:15:31.720 --> 03:15:37.720]  you're collect connected to a web and a network you can't be an individual you're going against
[03:15:37.720 --> 03:15:42.920]  the collective and so that's why huxley and other figures said that we really have to get rid of
[03:15:42.920 --> 03:15:47.640]  this idea of any kind of individualism now i think there's an extreme individualism that goes to
[03:15:47.640 --> 03:15:53.480]  opposite which is bad but we'll explain that when we come back this is the alex jones show
[03:15:53.480 --> 03:16:00.600]  and you're listening to jay dyer they decided to not perp walking not put him in handcuffs
[03:16:00.600 --> 03:16:04.600]  not do a mug shot because they knew that that would help trump didn't they know this would
[03:16:04.600 --> 03:16:09.160]  backfire we were waiting for the mug shot we learned today they wouldn't have it so we've made
[03:16:09.160 --> 03:16:16.119]  our own and it says political prisoner with an image of president trump the shirt is being printed

[03:16:22.760 --> 03:16:29.960]  there in a mug shot jail background it's a fundraiser shirt it says info wars.com on the back

[03:17:00.840 --> 03:17:04.760]  going to move against tucker carlson and take him off the air people said no way he's the most pop
[03:17:04.760 --> 03:17:09.000]  would ever happen they've got quadrillions of stolen money they only had tucker carlson on
[03:17:09.000 --> 03:17:12.360]  the air because they believe they could control him but as soon as they figured out they couldn't
[03:17:12.360 --> 03:17:17.960]  he was taken off the air it's the same thing with info wars but info wars is not owned by fox

[03:18:20.360 --> 03:18:25.080]  reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system out there that sells for twice the price
[03:18:25.160 --> 03:18:30.760]  and they made it as good in all the studies it reduces things to non-detectable levels
[03:18:30.760 --> 03:18:34.520]  thousands of chemicals but you can go pay two or three times there's four or five other filters
[03:18:34.520 --> 03:18:39.800]  out there that are just as good we sell the very best highest grade water filtration system for
[03:18:39.800 --> 03:18:46.040]  half the price of leading competitor and the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you

[03:18:59.160 --> 03:19:05.400]  were off gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into the atmosphere the surrounding communities
[03:19:05.400 --> 03:19:12.200]  began to get sick laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers to convert
[03:19:12.200 --> 03:19:18.920]  these gases into fluorosilicic acid still highly toxic but containable now these companies had a
[03:19:18.920 --> 03:19:24.279]  stockpile of this poison and there was no affordable way to dispose of it lucky for them
[03:19:24.279 --> 03:19:29.480]  one of their major stockholders was also the secretary of the treasury who was responsible
[03:19:29.480 --> 03:19:35.960]  for the public health service at the time and by 1950 the u.s government began buying this toxic
[03:19:35.960 --> 03:19:42.119]  untreated industrial waste product and dumping it into our drinking water reputable studies show
[03:19:42.119 --> 03:19:48.360]  that it's causing various cancers and other disease with the alexa pure pro you can have

[03:19:57.640 --> 03:20:05.240]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[03:20:05.400 --> 03:20:15.800]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm your guest host j.dyer jason allison we're covering
[03:20:15.800 --> 03:20:21.720]  fridoff copra's book the turning point science society and culture and what does he mean by
[03:20:21.720 --> 03:20:29.960]  turning point what does he mean by this juncture where everything now can shift away from the era
[03:20:29.960 --> 03:20:37.080]  of the enlightenment and individualism into a new reconstructed collectivism just like an alchemy you
[03:20:37.080 --> 03:20:44.440]  have the process of dissolving and breaking down and you have the phase of then re-coagulating and
[03:20:44.440 --> 03:20:48.440]  bringing it back into a new whole that's essentially what he's talking about and he
[03:20:48.440 --> 03:20:53.160]  actually goes into citing some of the mystical eastern texts he cites the I Ching and he says
[03:20:53.800 --> 03:21:01.400]  that this time of decay of the last several centuries of male phallic dominance and
[03:21:01.400 --> 03:21:05.640]  colonialism and this kind of stuff this will go away because now we're at the turning point
[03:21:06.680 --> 03:21:12.119]  he's he's appropriating the quote i'm saying to mean this where there will be a new movement this
[03:21:12.119 --> 03:21:17.800]  new movement will arise spontaneously naturally resulting in the transformation of the old
[03:21:17.800 --> 03:21:24.600]  change hope and change change change transformation turning point change always slogan slogan slogan
[03:21:24.600 --> 03:21:32.119]  never any real clear analysis of is it always good to change there's the assumption that change
[03:21:32.119 --> 03:21:38.440]  itself is good well can't we change for the worse why is change itself necessarily a good thing
[03:21:40.039 --> 03:21:44.600]  and he says well let's explain why things are changing in what direction we're going and he
[03:21:44.600 --> 03:21:50.199]  begins the book by saying that we're in a period of crisis and crisis leads to transformation
[03:21:52.279 --> 03:21:57.960]  and the crisis is always the crisis that the global elite have either fostered invented or
[03:21:57.960 --> 03:22:07.800]  have made up the crisis is overpopulation the crisis is nukes nuclear war the crisis is
[03:22:08.600 --> 03:22:15.880]  the environment being destroyed the a-bomb but at the same time when you read burton russell for
[03:22:15.880 --> 03:22:20.680]  example he says he takes credit the elite the elite invented all these things we created all
[03:22:20.680 --> 03:22:26.520]  these things we're so smart and by the way you're guilty uh it's your fault that we have these
[03:22:26.520 --> 03:22:30.440]  world-destroying weapons and dangerous to the environment so we got to get rid of everybody
[03:22:30.440 --> 03:22:36.359]  that's the that's the logic here now he mentions a few things that are also again actual dangers
[03:22:36.359 --> 03:22:41.800]  he says that for example the military industrial complex has arisen as a frightful power
[03:22:43.000 --> 03:22:51.000]  But, do you not realize that the military industrial complex is actually behind the push for the Aquarian conspiracy?
[03:22:51.000 --> 03:22:57.000]  That's who's behind this. Stanford Research, Wallace Harmon, Changing Images of Man.
[03:22:57.000 --> 03:23:02.000]  Stanford Research is part of the establishment military industrial complex.
[03:23:02.000 --> 03:23:14.000]  He says, yeah, but the ecology, the systems of ecology are now destroyed by air pollution and global climate change.
[03:23:16.000 --> 03:23:19.000]  He says that look at GMOs, genetic modification.
[03:23:19.000 --> 03:23:21.000]  Well, who's behind GMOs?
[03:23:22.000 --> 03:23:25.000]  It's not the people that are behind GMOs.
[03:23:25.000 --> 03:23:29.000]  It's gigantic multinational corporations like Monsanto, etc.
[03:23:30.000 --> 03:23:34.000]  But he's saying that we are all collectively guilty
[03:23:35.000 --> 03:23:39.000]  because of these ridiculous mad science projects
[03:23:40.000 --> 03:23:44.000]  of the mad science elite that run the planet for the Fortune 100
[03:23:45.000 --> 03:23:48.000]  and the international finance elite.
[03:23:49.000 --> 03:23:52.000]  He says that look what just happened in the 1970s.
[03:23:52.000 --> 03:23:54.000]  We had an energy crisis.
[03:23:54.000 --> 03:23:56.000]  And we had that energy crisis because...
[03:23:56.500 --> 03:24:03.860]  we're on fossil fuels. And he says that another problem, the reason we've had this energy
[03:24:03.860 --> 03:24:13.100]  crisis, I kid you not, he says, is because of patriarchalism. Patriarchy. It just wants
[03:24:13.100 --> 03:24:18.980]  to rape nature. It just wants to oppress women. And if we just had more feminism and equality
[03:24:18.980 --> 03:24:25.580]  in society, we wouldn't have the military industrial complex. I mean, this is just ridiculous.
[03:24:26.540 --> 03:24:30.620]  Then he goes on to cite actually something that vindicates what we were talking about
[03:24:30.620 --> 03:24:36.140]  with Dr. John Coleman was the references to civilizational patterns, Arnold Toynbee and
[03:24:36.140 --> 03:24:40.780]  Oswald Spengler. Now, Toynbee was one of the Fabian socialists who talked about these
[03:24:40.780 --> 03:24:45.100]  civilizational patterns, and he was a key figure at Wellington House, which was the propaganda
[03:24:45.100 --> 03:24:49.900]  outlet of the British Empire at the time of World War I. That would become eventually
[03:24:49.900 --> 03:24:58.460]  Tavistock. So we know that this is also then a Tavistock sourcing document. And he says,
[03:24:58.460 --> 03:25:03.620]  look, look at the patterns of civilizations, which I do think there are patterns for civilizations.
[03:25:03.620 --> 03:25:08.860]  The book of Daniel describes these patterns with the various empires. Spengler describes
[03:25:08.860 --> 03:25:15.420]  these patterns as a life cycle for civilizations. They have a birth, they have a rise, an apogee
[03:25:15.500 --> 03:25:23.260]  and a death, decline. And he cites these cycles of civilizations and even gives us diagrams.
[03:25:23.260 --> 03:25:35.660]  And this is all from Toynbee and Spengler models. Can you see that? Yeah. And he says, well, see,
[03:25:35.660 --> 03:25:39.820]  we're in one of those decline collapse. And he says that because we're in a decline collapse,
[03:25:39.820 --> 03:25:49.820]  we can now create the new technocratic utopian style civilization. And he even says that we can
[03:25:49.820 --> 03:25:58.860]  look at civilization figures talking about this world order who preceded us, who understood the
[03:25:58.860 --> 03:26:07.340]  universal rhythms. He says, St. Simon and Herbert Spencer and Hegel saw human civilization in these
[03:26:07.340 --> 03:26:12.540]  cultural evolutions and developments. Of course, St. Simon was an illuminist,
[03:26:13.100 --> 03:26:17.580]  right? And he was actually a Jacobin style, hardcore socialist communist.
[03:26:18.140 --> 03:26:22.540]  Herbert Spencer, of course, one of the key promoters of evolutionary theory, Hegel, the
[03:26:22.540 --> 03:26:28.460]  philosopher who provided the dialectics for Marx. Marx flipped Hegel on his head. But so you can see
[03:26:28.460 --> 03:26:34.380]  that he says, we got to follow these guys because their evolutionary philosophy, their metaphysics
[03:26:34.380 --> 03:26:35.180]  of evolution.
[03:26:35.300 --> 03:26:40.660]  Proves that everything has changed, everything is evolving.
[03:26:40.660 --> 03:26:44.740]  That's also, by the way, the philosophy of Marx, Lenin and Trotsky, right?
[03:26:44.740 --> 03:26:51.740]  The Marxist philosophy is everything in nature is in dialectical battle.
[03:26:51.740 --> 03:26:57.300]  And because nature and evolutionary philosophy show this, that Marxists would utilize Survival
[03:26:57.300 --> 03:26:59.420]  of the Fittest to prove this.
[03:26:59.420 --> 03:27:04.539]  And that somehow the species, for example, in the Survival of the Fittest model, it battles
[03:27:04.539 --> 03:27:09.580]  against nature, against death, against whatever, to produce the fitter members of the species
[03:27:09.580 --> 03:27:11.300]  for the good of the species.
[03:27:11.300 --> 03:27:12.939]  So hence the collectivism, you see.
[03:27:14.100 --> 03:27:22.100]  And so, he says, as a result of this, and the decline of patriarchy, it's time for feminism.
[03:27:22.100 --> 03:27:28.100]  It's time for Gaia to balance out things. This is so ridiculous. This is just propaganda.
[03:27:28.100 --> 03:27:37.100]  But now you'll notice that this is the kind of person that's cited as if this is a authoritative global figure.
[03:27:38.100 --> 03:27:44.100]  He's kind of like a Jacques Attali or a great thinker of the elite.
[03:27:44.100 --> 03:27:54.100]  But all he's doing is just putting out propaganda that says that, oh, by the way, we just need no fuel.
[03:27:54.100 --> 03:27:56.100]  Which, by the way, they're shutting down.
[03:27:56.100 --> 03:28:00.100]  They're shutting down cars and automobiles and having a car.
[03:28:00.100 --> 03:28:09.100]  Now, as part of this agenda written about in the 1980s as an austerity shutdown model.
[03:28:09.100 --> 03:28:15.100]  And the auspices are all fraudulent. Oh, it's all bad for the earth.
[03:28:15.100 --> 03:28:21.100]  And how do we know that? Well, because of the experts. Who's the experts? This guy, the propagandists.
[03:28:21.100 --> 03:28:29.100]  So you've just been propagandized. And he says it's time for a paradigm shift, future shock.
[03:28:29.100 --> 03:28:36.100]  Exactly what Toffler talks about. Again, Tavis talks of power shift, he says paradigm shift, future shock.
[03:28:36.100 --> 03:28:42.100]  All the same buzzwords, because it's all from the same people.
[03:28:42.100 --> 03:28:49.100]  Next, we're going to talk about the history of revolutions and how he ties in what Huxley says about the coming technocratic order.
[03:28:49.100 --> 03:28:52.100]  Brave new world as the final revolution. He says the exact same thing.
[03:28:53.100 --> 03:28:56.100]  This is the Alex Jones show. Don't go anywhere.
[03:28:56.100 --> 03:29:01.100]  Turbo Force is back, sold out for eight months, and it's Turbo Force Plus.
[03:29:01.100 --> 03:29:07.100]  We made it even stronger. The strongest long term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[03:29:07.100 --> 03:29:14.100]  Turbo Force is back in stock at Infowarsstore.com or triple a two five three three one three nine.
[03:29:14.100 --> 03:29:22.100]  It's not just wide spectrum Nash natural herbs that time release over 10 hours should be called 10 hour energy.
[03:29:22.100 --> 03:29:30.100]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids that turbo charge everything.
[03:29:30.100 --> 03:29:35.100]  And are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[03:29:35.100 --> 03:29:40.100]  It is the super fuel. Rain Force Plus is great. Rain Force Ultra is great.
[03:29:41.100 --> 03:29:46.100]  They go good with this. But this is the King Kong. This is the boss.
[03:29:46.100 --> 03:29:53.100]  Turbo Force back in stock. Discounted. Infowarsstore.com. More power, more strength, more energy.
[03:29:56.100 --> 03:30:03.100]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire food supply.
[03:30:03.100 --> 03:30:12.100]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element, which has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[03:30:12.100 --> 03:30:18.100]  And there are two things we need to do about it. We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[03:30:18.100 --> 03:30:27.100]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally keep the soil rich with iodine.
[03:30:27.100 --> 03:30:37.100]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the Earth's surface.
[03:30:37.100 --> 03:30:43.100]  Our Infowars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[03:30:43.100 --> 03:30:52.100]  Pure nascent iodine stabilized in an activated tri iodine form for a healthy thyroid and a healthy metabolism.

[03:30:56.100 --> 03:31:04.100]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on Earth, and they've got our children drinking that.
[03:31:04.100 --> 03:31:10.100]  This is a psychotic death cult. Period. Case closed. Out to get you and your family.
[03:31:10.100 --> 03:31:15.100]  We sell the Alexa Pure Breeze made by the My Patriot Supply Ready Hour Group.
[03:31:15.100 --> 03:31:18.100]  It's been around about 15 years. Became the biggest company in the last six.
[03:31:18.100 --> 03:31:24.100]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system out there that sells for twice the price.
[03:31:24.100 --> 03:31:31.100]  And they made it as good in all the studies. It reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals.
[03:31:31.100 --> 03:31:35.100]  But you can go pay two or three times. There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[03:31:35.100 --> 03:31:40.100]  We sell the very best, highest grade water filtration system for half the price of a leading competitor.
[03:31:40.100 --> 03:31:46.100]  And the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter your water.
[03:31:46.100 --> 03:31:49.100]  You should also filter your shower water. That's another way you absorb this crap.
[03:31:49.100 --> 03:31:51.100]  But I'm done talking about that.
[03:31:51.100 --> 03:31:55.100]  The point is you get the filters at InfoWorksStore.com. They're discounted right now.
[03:31:55.100 --> 03:31:56.100]  Finally back in stock.
[03:31:56.100 --> 03:32:02.100]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution is laying right there in front of you, hidden in plain view.
[03:32:02.100 --> 03:32:05.100]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[03:32:05.100 --> 03:32:15.100]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website where they admit the number one cause of cognitive disability in the world is iodine deficiency.
[03:32:15.100 --> 03:32:28.100]  The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability is lack of real, pure iodine in the body as they bomb us with the bad halogens, bromine, bromide, chlorine, and so much more.
[03:32:28.100 --> 03:32:38.100]  Upwards of two billion people in a Lancet Medical Journal study in 2007 worldwide have cognitive disabilities because they don't have high quality iodine.
[03:32:38.100 --> 03:32:41.100]  Most iodine is bound to other elements. You don't absorb it.
[03:32:41.100 --> 03:32:46.100]  We have X3, all three types of good iodine together that supercharges your body.
[03:32:46.100 --> 03:32:52.100]  X3 is now back in stock at InfoWorksStore.com. It's been sold out for over six months for 25% off.

[03:32:57.100 --> 03:33:04.100]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:05.300 --> 03:33:16.340]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show, I'm your guest host Jay Dyer of Jays Analysis.
[03:33:16.340 --> 03:33:24.340]  We are analyzing the cycles of history based on Spangler and Toynbee that Frito Capra has
[03:33:24.340 --> 03:33:28.699]  mentioned in his book, Frito Capricorn has mentioned.
[03:33:28.699 --> 03:33:34.099]  And he talks about revolutions in history, particularly the French Revolution, the revolutions
[03:33:34.099 --> 03:33:39.699]  of the 1800s all the way up until today, and he says that what this has taught us is the
[03:33:39.699 --> 03:33:46.019]  faith in historical process, faith in revolution, because revolution reflects in the mind of
[03:33:46.019 --> 03:33:51.220]  the revolutionaries, they're not just communists, there's revolutionaries of all stripes.
[03:33:51.220 --> 03:33:58.779]  All revolutionaries serve the eventual outworking of the dialectical synthesis.
[03:33:58.779 --> 03:34:06.740]  He says that revolution is a reflection of progress and history moving towards its apex,
[03:34:06.740 --> 03:34:11.699]  towards its omega point, towards its end goal.
[03:34:11.699 --> 03:34:15.859]  For example, Hegel said that history would eventually evolve into a kind of a transhumanist
[03:34:15.859 --> 03:34:20.539]  self-consciousness where all reality would kind of become God.
[03:34:20.539 --> 03:34:29.179]  And so being, which is stasis or fixity or immobility, is always in a battle with becoming
[03:34:29.179 --> 03:34:33.420]  and flux and change in the history of philosophy.
[03:34:33.420 --> 03:34:38.539]  But what he's saying is that what we've learned is that no, in fact, reality itself is all
[03:34:38.539 --> 03:34:46.380]  pure change, pure flux, and so they're really repeating the ancient philosophical systems
[03:34:46.380 --> 03:34:53.220]  that everything is flux, right, Heraclitus, and that's why even the Marxists themselves,
[03:34:53.220 --> 03:34:57.060]  I think it's either Lenin or Trotsky, would actually say, I'm just repeating the ancient
[03:34:57.060 --> 03:35:02.660]  philosophy of Heraclitus, which is that everything is in permanent, perpetual flux.
[03:35:02.660 --> 03:35:09.500]  In other words, nature itself is revolution, constant revolution, and thus nothing is actually
[03:35:09.500 --> 03:35:13.939]  true, nothing is actually objective, nothing is actually certain, everything is subject
[03:35:13.939 --> 03:35:19.980]  to constant flux and change, and he says that this is dialectics, right, and dialectics
[03:35:19.980 --> 03:35:27.699]  is what Eastern philosophies were always teaching, and he says that's why we have to look at
[03:35:27.699 --> 03:35:32.900]  the notion of Daoism, process and change in Daoism, because in Daoism everything is
[03:35:32.900 --> 03:35:40.740]  understood in this point, counterpoint, thesis, antithesis, right, position, opposition, position
[03:35:40.740 --> 03:35:48.619]  negation stance, yin-yang, earth-heaven, moon-sun, night-day, black-white, winter-summer, these
[03:35:48.619 --> 03:35:54.539]  are dialectically seen as in opposition and in contrast and tension.
[03:35:54.539 --> 03:36:03.500]  Daoist philosophy, he says, is a philosophy of dialectics, and thus it was easily, China
[03:36:03.500 --> 03:36:09.300]  for example, he says, easily accepted Marxism and Marxist dialectics, because of the history
[03:36:09.300 --> 03:36:15.420]  that they had with, for example, Confucianism, Confucianism is also a dialectical position.
[03:36:15.420 --> 03:36:20.779]  We have this constant back and forth between yin and yang, the feminine versus the masculine,
[03:36:20.779 --> 03:36:29.580]  the contracting versus the expanding, growth versus contraction, conservation versus non-conservation
[03:36:29.580 --> 03:36:39.140]  or revolution, cooperation versus competition, synthesis versus analysis, and he says that
[03:36:39.140 --> 03:36:43.900]  all of this is constantly working out in history, all actions, all governments, everything
[03:36:43.900 --> 03:36:51.939]  towards a greater future union, a balance of union.
[03:36:51.939 --> 03:36:58.820]  He says, look at even the right and left brain, our hemispheres, you see, then he goes back
[03:36:58.820 --> 03:37:02.460]  into history and he says that the history of Western philosophy was just really one
[03:37:02.460 --> 03:37:08.740]  position, one limited positing of a position that was true for that time, but in the greater
[03:37:08.740 --> 03:37:12.939]  whole it needs to be now negated.
[03:37:12.939 --> 03:37:20.380]  All of Western civilization needs to be negated by its opposite, and by the way, Marxism believed
[03:37:20.380 --> 03:37:23.980]  the same thing, that is Marxism.
[03:37:23.980 --> 03:37:31.340]  So systems analysis tells us that because nature is a giant evolutionary survival of
[03:37:31.340 --> 03:37:38.140]  the fittest system, everything has to work out in the same praxis way.
[03:37:38.140 --> 03:37:42.980]  That's why Marxists, for example, always engage in what they call praxis, which is activism,
[03:37:42.980 --> 03:37:43.980]  action.
[03:37:43.980 --> 03:37:45.980]  You have to take action.
[03:37:45.980 --> 03:37:48.779]  True Marxism is not sitting back and theorizing.
[03:37:48.779 --> 03:37:52.300]  You must take action to further the dialectic.
[03:37:52.300 --> 03:37:57.539]  Taking action is Marxism.
[03:37:57.539 --> 03:38:02.019]  He says social Darwinism is part of this, and so it's not that the British Empire and
[03:38:02.019 --> 03:38:06.380]  its social Darwinian philosophy and all this kind of stuff was inherently evil, it was just
[03:38:06.380 --> 03:38:13.619]  a time-bound necessary dialectical phase, which gives way to new phases.
[03:38:13.619 --> 03:38:17.939]  And he says this is a process that we are now moving into.
[03:38:17.939 --> 03:38:23.179]  He says that, let's look at Newton, Newton gave us this notion of a mechanistic society,
[03:38:23.179 --> 03:38:29.259]  the Royal Society, Baconianism, Scientism, all of that, that's a very highly rational
[03:38:29.259 --> 03:38:34.460]  system, which now must give way to the new system.
[03:38:34.460 --> 03:38:43.539]  So basically everything now is, it's basically Mother Earth manifesting as a living organism
[03:38:43.539 --> 03:38:45.820]  phases of her life cycle and development.
[03:38:46.900 --> 03:38:56.900]  And since we've had this dominance of the dialectical imbalance of masculinity for the past several centuries in Western civilization,
[03:38:56.900 --> 03:39:01.900]  it's now time to capitulate to the dominance of the feminine, to balance things out.
[03:39:01.900 --> 03:39:06.900]  Like the force type stuff.
[03:39:06.900 --> 03:39:12.900]  Luke, Luke, use the feminist side of the force, Luke.
[03:39:13.900 --> 03:39:17.900]  Luke, Luke, be cocked by the force.
[03:39:17.900 --> 03:39:19.900]  This kind of a thing.
[03:39:19.900 --> 03:39:26.900]  Einstein, he says, was a new student because now he unseated the previous models.
[03:39:26.900 --> 03:39:45.699]  So he says that Einstein unseated all this and gave us this return to a model where reality
[03:39:45.699 --> 03:39:55.900]  is purely relativistic, and relativistic physics is concomitant with relativistic views and
[03:39:55.900 --> 03:40:02.460]  everything else, philosophy, ethics, social-cultural relativism, no culture is any better or any
[03:40:02.460 --> 03:40:06.619]  worse than any other, they're all relative, you see, it all goes together with the new
[03:40:06.619 --> 03:40:11.020]  systems and the new models that have been introduced, and he says all these things are
[03:40:11.020 --> 03:40:16.900]  great because they're actually leading us to the next phase out of Newtonianism and
[03:40:16.900 --> 03:40:23.300]  after Darwinism, we now have quantum physics, uncertainty, the double-slit experiment, all
[03:40:23.300 --> 03:40:28.779]  this kind of stuff, and he says that all that is there to basically confirm our Eastern
[03:40:28.779 --> 03:40:38.300]  metaphysics of reality being basically illusory, that there's no such thing as Aristotelian
[03:40:38.300 --> 03:40:43.859]  laws of, you know, the three laws, law of non-contradiction, the law of excluded middle,
[03:40:43.859 --> 03:40:48.539]  the law of identity, those things, those don't exist anymore, everything is in a dance of
[03:40:48.539 --> 03:40:53.980]  energy and a flux, everything is becoming.
[03:40:53.980 --> 03:40:59.220]  And then he actually posits some kind of like a weird matrix theory where he talks about
[03:40:59.220 --> 03:41:04.859]  the subatomic particles prove that we're in some sort of, maybe even we're in a hologram
[03:41:04.859 --> 03:41:09.740]  or a simulation, this kind of a thing, but all of these models are really reductionist
[03:41:09.740 --> 03:41:16.060]  and they're just basically making huge religious metaphysical leaps that as if he knows what
[03:41:16.060 --> 03:41:18.420]  all reality is.
[03:41:18.420 --> 03:41:26.779]  So he's positing a sort of a mystical scientism, he mentions Paracelsus, he mentions these alchemists
[03:41:26.779 --> 03:41:35.260]  and these mystics, and he says that it's time to get away from extreme materialism that
[03:41:35.260 --> 03:41:41.660]  came as a result of Darwinism and now we need, even though Darwin, Lyell, and Malthus gave
[03:41:41.660 --> 03:41:48.140]  us great insights, he says it's time to move to a new kind of spirituality, you see.
[03:41:48.140 --> 03:41:52.300]  And I would agree that, yeah, that materialism and Darwinism and all that are bad news.
[03:41:52.300 --> 03:42:00.060]  But the spirituality that he's giving us is a weird new age spirituality, something
[03:42:00.060 --> 03:42:04.300]  more akin to theosophy, right, out of Blavatsky and her Seeker doctrine.
[03:42:04.300 --> 03:42:08.820]  And remember, we've covered, I've got many videos, many talks on this, but Blavatsky
[03:42:08.820 --> 03:42:12.619]  was basically a British intelligence agent for the Fabian socialists.
[03:42:12.619 --> 03:42:14.340]  She was a Fabian socialist.
[03:42:14.400 --> 03:42:22.320]  So she's working for the power structure, and I think she was even probably a British
[03:42:22.320 --> 03:42:23.320]  spy.
[03:42:23.320 --> 03:42:29.240]  But he says that, look, there's a lot of propaganda in science, which is true.
[03:42:29.240 --> 03:42:31.440]  So not everything that Copper says is false, right?
[03:42:31.440 --> 03:42:32.680]  He says GMOs are bad.
[03:42:32.680 --> 03:42:33.680]  Okay.
[03:42:33.680 --> 03:42:34.680]  Yeah, that's good.
[03:42:34.680 --> 03:42:35.680]  But his answers are terrible.
[03:42:35.680 --> 03:42:40.320]  It's like identify real problems, get even worse solutions, you see.
[03:42:40.320 --> 03:42:43.960]  So when we come back, we'll get into what are his solutions and what are the models
[03:42:43.960 --> 03:42:49.240]  that he proposes for the new coming post turning point society.
[03:42:49.240 --> 03:42:51.359]  What is the new society going to be like?
[03:42:51.359 --> 03:42:52.359]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:42:52.359 --> 03:42:53.359]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer.
[03:42:53.359 --> 03:42:54.359]  Jay's analysis.
[03:42:54.359 --> 03:42:55.359]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:42:55.359 --> 03:42:56.359]  Come right back.
[03:42:56.359 --> 03:43:01.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution is laying right there in front of you, hidden
[03:43:01.960 --> 03:43:03.560]  in plain view.
[03:43:03.560 --> 03:43:06.320]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[03:43:06.320 --> 03:43:10.600]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website where they admit the number
[03:43:10.600 --> 03:43:15.840]  one cause of cognitive disability in the world is iodine deficiency.
[03:43:15.840 --> 03:43:23.119]  The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability is lack of real, pure iodine in
[03:43:23.119 --> 03:43:29.400]  the body as they bomb us with the bad halogens, bromine, bromide, chlorine, and so much more.
[03:43:29.400 --> 03:43:35.560]  Upwards of 2 billion people in a Lancet Medical Journal study in 2007 worldwide have cognitive
[03:43:35.560 --> 03:43:39.480]  disabilities because they don't have high quality iodine.
[03:43:39.480 --> 03:43:41.760]  This iodine is bound to other elements you're going to absorb it.
[03:43:41.760 --> 03:43:47.240]  We have X3, all three types of good iodine together that supercharges your body.
[03:43:47.240 --> 03:43:49.600]  X3 is now back in stock at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:43:49.600 --> 03:43:53.440]  It's been sold out for over six months for 25% off.
[03:43:53.440 --> 03:43:54.800]  X3 back in stock.
[03:43:54.800 --> 03:43:55.800]  Take action now.
[03:43:55.800 --> 03:43:56.800]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:43:56.800 --> 03:44:03.680]  I want to say brain force is great.
[03:44:03.680 --> 03:44:05.680]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[03:44:05.680 --> 03:44:06.680]  It is.
[03:44:06.680 --> 03:44:11.160]  If you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[03:44:11.160 --> 03:44:14.400]  The fish oil is better than it, and that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[03:44:14.400 --> 03:44:20.039]  Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[03:44:20.039 --> 03:44:23.640]  Krill oils is the best, and it'll give you the damn burps, and I'm just sorry.
[03:44:23.640 --> 03:44:24.640]  You want something like this?
[03:44:24.640 --> 03:44:25.640]  You don't get stuff for free.
[03:44:25.640 --> 03:44:26.640]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[03:44:26.640 --> 03:44:27.640]  It's so good.
[03:44:27.640 --> 03:44:28.640]  In my view.
[03:44:28.640 --> 03:44:31.520]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something, and I eat five
[03:44:31.520 --> 03:44:33.640]  capulets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[03:44:33.640 --> 03:44:41.520]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night, so your brain is made basically out of what fish oil
[03:44:41.520 --> 03:44:48.080]  is, so we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever
[03:44:48.080 --> 03:44:50.440]  the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[03:44:50.440 --> 03:44:57.080]  I just can't do it.
[03:44:57.080 --> 03:44:59.640]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[03:44:59.640 --> 03:45:01.720]  Please write this down, and please go look this up.
[03:45:01.720 --> 03:45:03.760]  It will change your life.
[03:45:03.760 --> 03:45:08.240]  The UN admits, and the Lancet Medical Journal admits that upwards of two billion people
[03:45:08.240 --> 03:45:12.480]  have mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities.
[03:45:12.480 --> 03:45:18.000]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[03:45:18.000 --> 03:45:22.840]  Most iodine in the environment is bound to other elements, so your body can't absorb
[03:45:22.840 --> 03:45:23.840]  it.
[03:45:23.840 --> 03:45:29.800]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells, and infowarestore.com has
[03:45:29.800 --> 03:45:35.199]  the only iodine out there that actually has this type of full effect.
[03:45:35.199 --> 03:45:38.119]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3's been sold out for six months.
[03:45:38.119 --> 03:45:41.080]  It's very hard to produce, and it's finally back in stock.
[03:45:41.080 --> 03:45:44.119]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[03:45:44.119 --> 03:45:46.300]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is powerful.
[03:45:46.300 --> 03:45:47.600]  You and your family need it.
[03:45:47.600 --> 03:45:50.039]  It's 25% off, back in stock.
[03:45:50.039 --> 03:45:51.039]  X3.
[03:45:51.039 --> 03:45:54.119]  Try iodine exclusively at infowarestore.com.
[03:45:54.119 --> 03:45:57.840]  Take action now, but regardless, research is info.
[03:45:57.880 --> 03:46:01.359]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[03:46:01.359 --> 03:46:06.279]  I don't think anybody can deny it, and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting
[03:46:06.279 --> 03:46:07.279]  us.
[03:46:07.279 --> 03:46:12.720]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[03:46:12.720 --> 03:46:17.800]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight, and when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen
[03:46:17.800 --> 03:46:23.400]  Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really
[03:46:23.400 --> 03:46:24.400]  just incredible.
[03:46:25.119 --> 03:46:28.119]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[03:46:28.119 --> 03:46:33.160]  I want to encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not
[03:46:33.160 --> 03:46:34.160]  support us.
[03:46:34.160 --> 03:46:37.640]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it,
[03:46:37.640 --> 03:46:42.520]  but most viewers and listeners never go to infowarestore.com, and you never buy great
[03:46:42.520 --> 03:46:45.960]  products that enrich and empower your life, while at the same time keeping us on air.
[03:46:45.960 --> 03:46:50.800]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at infowarestore.com.
[03:46:50.800 --> 03:46:54.960]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to infowarestore.com, our funding problems
[03:46:54.960 --> 03:46:55.960]  will be over.
[03:46:55.960 --> 03:46:56.960]  Please take action now.
[03:46:56.960 --> 03:47:04.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:05.500 --> 03:47:18.500]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show, I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[03:47:18.500 --> 03:47:22.380]  The most important part of this book, I think, I mean, there's a lot of really interesting
[03:47:22.380 --> 03:47:30.220]  nuggets and fascinating little tidbits that he throws out there, but it's the foresight
[03:47:30.220 --> 03:47:38.260]  that he had to discuss how the transformation in society, one of the key elements that would
[03:47:38.260 --> 03:47:45.700]  be there in society to bring this about would be the medicine arena, medicine, and he says
[03:47:45.700 --> 03:47:53.020]  that in order to bring about this transformation into this new era of the, you know, austerity,
[03:47:53.020 --> 03:47:58.380]  you know, new age, depopulation, Malthusian model, he said that we needed a new model
[03:47:58.380 --> 03:48:02.140]  of what humans were, right?
[03:48:02.140 --> 03:48:06.660]  And there's a book I just got, one of the global elite texts, it's really rare, it's
[03:48:06.660 --> 03:48:10.780]  The Molecular Vision of Life by Lily Kay, and that's a book produced by the Rockefeller
[03:48:10.780 --> 03:48:15.060]  Foundation, and my buddy Tristan, he's done talks on this on his YouTube channel for
[03:48:15.060 --> 03:48:20.780]  many years, and it was hard to get, I finally got a copy of it, and it's amazing because
[03:48:20.780 --> 03:48:24.860]  it's actually what Copper's talking about, he's saying that Rockefeller Foundation played
[03:48:24.860 --> 03:48:31.380]  a key role in sort of co-opting medicine, and that would be a key way in which cultural
[03:48:31.380 --> 03:48:34.100]  transformation would occur kind of back door.
[03:48:34.100 --> 03:48:37.980]  We always think about, oh, it's going to be the 1984 big brother government that's going
[03:48:37.980 --> 03:48:42.900]  to put the boot up on our necks and, you know, squish us and all this kind of, which, yeah,
[03:48:42.900 --> 03:48:48.820]  that happens, but the real way that the system would transfer into this great reset and credit
[03:48:48.820 --> 03:48:53.180]  model is actually through medicine.
[03:48:53.180 --> 03:48:58.420]  The new world order coming into view through giant insurance corporations and through giant
[03:48:58.420 --> 03:49:03.540]  medical conglomerates, and so we needed a new vision of what the human being was and
[03:49:03.540 --> 03:49:11.500]  what biology was, and so we got that through these entities taking over and reframing
[03:49:11.500 --> 03:49:18.820]  medicine and reframing then everything else on the basis of the new biology.
[03:49:18.820 --> 03:49:19.820]  And what does that mean?
[03:49:19.820 --> 03:49:23.220]  Simply put, man isn't a being made in the image of God.
[03:49:23.220 --> 03:49:26.340]  We need a changing image of man.
[03:49:26.340 --> 03:49:30.780]  Man is a cog in the wheel or the machine of the cosmos.
[03:49:30.780 --> 03:49:34.860]  Man is a cell on the surface of Mother Gaia's skin.
[03:49:35.000 --> 03:49:45.080]  And this, you see, when we view man as a piece in a holistic system, now it's a collectivist
[03:49:45.080 --> 03:49:50.440]  oligarchic model, and now we have the justification for the good of society, for the good of Mother
[03:49:50.440 --> 03:49:56.520]  Earth, to shut down, suppress, destroy, etc., under emergency measures.
[03:49:56.600 --> 03:50:01.360]  Great.
[03:50:01.400 --> 03:50:08.400]  reproduction, economics, etc.
[03:50:09.100 --> 03:50:12.100]  Mother Earth is a life cycle, right?
[03:50:12.100 --> 03:50:17.100]  So maybe you should be recycling and sharing your property, bro.
[03:50:17.100 --> 03:50:19.100]  You need a circular economy.
[03:50:19.100 --> 03:50:22.100]  You need an app where you share your whitey tighties with the other people in you.
[03:50:22.100 --> 03:50:24.100]  You don't need two pairs of whitey tighties.
[03:50:24.100 --> 03:50:28.100]  Just share that with your neighbors in your coom pod complex.
[03:50:28.100 --> 03:50:29.100]  Literally.
[03:50:28.600 --> 03:50:29.600]  Thank you.
[03:50:29.600 --> 03:50:30.600]  Bye-bye.
[03:50:32.000 --> 03:50:37.000]  You see, everything must be reformed and changed.
[03:50:37.000 --> 03:50:40.000]  It's no different than what The Great Reset is about.
[03:50:40.000 --> 03:50:43.000]  These are the same people in the same circles with the same plans.
[03:50:43.000 --> 03:50:46.000]  And every week, it's almost two years now.
[03:50:46.000 --> 03:50:50.000]  Two years I've been coming on The Fourth Hour, reading you from their texts.
[03:50:50.600 --> 03:50:59.720]  The New Age requires, Copper says, a new economics.
[03:50:59.720 --> 03:51:06.280]  This will be an economics of integrated systems, recycling a circular economy, right?
[03:51:06.280 --> 03:51:10.480]  Ida Alkin, buddies with Klaus and all them, the World Economic Forum, she gives TED Talks
[03:51:10.480 --> 03:51:16.400]  on circular economy, we need to recycle.
[03:51:16.400 --> 03:51:23.400]  Recycling will be reintegrated into a holistic systems approach.
[03:51:23.400 --> 03:51:26.640]  What's the dark side of growth?
[03:51:26.640 --> 03:51:30.560]  Well growth can't go on, it must be stopped, it must be halted.
[03:51:30.560 --> 03:51:36.000]  We need limits to growth, that's their phraseology, terminology, that's their white papers and
[03:51:36.000 --> 03:51:39.440]  documents, limits to growth in all areas.
[03:51:39.500 --> 03:51:53.500]  In fact, some of these people have posited since the 1970s, ZPG, zero population growth.
[03:51:53.500 --> 03:52:01.260]  Growth must cease, he says, because we've learned through the study of nature that beings in
[03:52:01.260 --> 03:52:05.460]  nature don't continue to grow, they die.
[03:52:05.460 --> 03:52:09.740]  So you must accept this death process, it's a death cult.
[03:52:10.800 --> 03:52:17.800]  And you must be willing to die for the holistic system.
[03:52:17.800 --> 03:52:22.800]  Holistic health, holistic ecology, holistic systems analysis.
[03:52:22.800 --> 03:52:25.800]  He says all of this will undergo radical change.
[03:52:25.800 --> 03:52:30.800]  Now, by the way, I'm not opposed to holistic organic food and health, that's not what he's talking about.
[03:52:30.800 --> 03:52:35.800]  He's saying that health movements, which are getting popular in the 1980s,
[03:52:35.800 --> 03:52:38.800]  eating fresh food, this kind of stuff, which is all great.
[03:52:38.800 --> 03:52:42.800]  He's saying that needs to be utilized and co-opted, exactly what Alvin Toffler said.
[03:52:42.800 --> 03:52:51.800]  Toffler said we will tie the vegetarian and vegan movement into political revolutionary social movements
[03:52:51.800 --> 03:52:56.800]  to eventually control people's diets.
[03:52:56.800 --> 03:52:58.800]  And Toffler cited Plato.
[03:52:59.800 --> 03:53:03.800]  And here he is citing the systems view.
[03:53:03.800 --> 03:53:09.800]  This is directly from the Arthur Kessler book, The Holons.
[03:53:09.800 --> 03:53:14.800]  Goes to the machine, discusses systems analysis of nature,
[03:53:14.800 --> 03:53:18.800]  and you see everything in nature is part of a holistic system,
[03:53:18.800 --> 03:53:20.800]  so therefore you don't have individual rights.
[03:53:20.800 --> 03:53:21.800]  That's the logic of this.
[03:53:22.500 --> 03:53:32.900]  Hierarchies in nature, he says, are there because they promote the holistic view.
[03:53:32.900 --> 03:53:34.900]  And here's the craziest part of this book.
[03:53:34.900 --> 03:53:39.980]  He says that when it comes to wholeness and health, we're going to have to have a new
[03:53:39.980 --> 03:53:45.460]  process to how we integrate human beings into society.
[03:53:45.460 --> 03:53:51.380]  He actually, I'm not joking, he actually says, now this is after the 1960s counterculture
[03:53:51.380 --> 03:53:52.380]  revolution, right?
[03:53:52.380 --> 03:53:53.380]  This is 1982.
[03:53:53.380 --> 03:53:59.740]  He says, we've got quantum theory, quantum physics, everything's new, everything's changing.
[03:53:59.740 --> 03:54:07.460]  And he says that when we look at the studies that were done of Gregory Bateson studying
[03:54:07.460 --> 03:54:14.620]  schizophrenics, now Gregory Bateson was one of the in-culture doctors and Bateson famously
[03:54:14.620 --> 03:54:19.980]  said, you know, if you want to control mankind, control and capture his imagination.
[03:54:19.980 --> 03:54:25.260]  And he studied families and schizophrenic members of families and whether this might
[03:54:25.260 --> 03:54:26.460]  be genetic.
[03:54:26.460 --> 03:54:31.100]  And he actually, he actually says, schizophrenia is not a bad thing.
[03:54:31.100 --> 03:54:35.660]  In fact, maybe there's a kind of a mystical interplay.
[03:54:35.660 --> 03:54:40.340]  That's a good thing for dissociative states.
[03:54:40.340 --> 03:54:48.780]  He says, mystics in societies, shamans, well, they are basically like schizophrenics, religions,
[03:54:48.780 --> 03:54:50.740]  just people hearing and seeing visions.
[03:54:50.740 --> 03:54:52.740]  That's all just schizophrenia.
[03:54:52.740 --> 03:54:54.540]  And maybe they play a key role in society.
[03:54:54.540 --> 03:55:02.060]  He says, why don't we have initiation that initiate people into a kind of a shamanistic
[03:55:02.060 --> 03:55:03.060]  new religion?
[03:55:03.060 --> 03:55:05.660]  And he cites Gregory Bateson for this.
[03:55:05.660 --> 03:55:10.740]  He says, that would be a better approach to religion, getting everybody to just be initiated
[03:55:10.740 --> 03:55:12.240]  through LSD.
[03:55:12.240 --> 03:55:15.220]  And then they'll be integrated into the global system because people that do these drugs
[03:55:15.220 --> 03:55:18.060]  typically think they want to, oh, we're all one dude.
[03:55:18.060 --> 03:55:21.620]  We need to be united because we're all one dude.
[03:55:21.620 --> 03:55:25.340]  So basically, Brave New World is what this chapter is.
[03:55:25.340 --> 03:55:30.220]  This chapter argues everybody, we need a mass induction into.
[03:55:30.400 --> 03:55:40.600]  Eco-worship through everybody taking drugs and then he says, we'll be into deep ecology.
[03:55:40.600 --> 03:55:47.400]  You'll realize Mother Earth's alive and all this, basically ancient paganism.
[03:55:47.400 --> 03:55:53.520]  And these approaches he says will lead to a new society and finally we'll have a balance
[03:55:53.520 --> 03:55:55.720]  between men and women.
[03:55:55.720 --> 03:55:59.800]  But he couldn't pass up the opportunity to say that what we really need in terms of world
[03:55:59.800 --> 03:56:02.279]  religion is a goddess.
[03:56:02.279 --> 03:56:06.560]  If we can just go back to the image of the goddess, then we will resolve the one in the
[03:56:06.560 --> 03:56:07.560]  many problem.
[03:56:07.560 --> 03:56:11.760]  The one in the many being, should we have a balance between the one in the many, should
[03:56:11.760 --> 03:56:18.080]  the one rule or should the many rule, democracy, collectivism, fascism, socialism, those are
[03:56:18.080 --> 03:56:26.640]  all social manifestations of the one in the many question of ancient philosophy.
[03:56:26.640 --> 03:56:33.600]  And he says that the 60s counterculture revolution that was actually a CIA promoted thing.
[03:56:33.600 --> 03:56:39.080]  He says that that is part of the evolutionary process to bring in the new age, the new era,
[03:56:39.080 --> 03:56:44.640]  which will be an era where we live in harmony and we don't try to have children and we just
[03:56:44.640 --> 03:56:48.160]  submit to living in a coon pod, that's what he says.
[03:56:48.160 --> 03:56:53.520]  So there you have it, yet another text where we find out that Brave New World was not a
[03:56:53.520 --> 03:56:54.520]  fiction thing.
[03:56:54.520 --> 03:57:01.600]  They were not the random usings of some fringe academic literary nerd, no, they were part
[03:57:01.600 --> 03:57:08.440]  of a structure, a super structure, a super class that writes many, many, many super
[03:57:08.440 --> 03:57:14.160]  boring books that lay all of this out as the actual plan of where they want to go.
[03:57:14.160 --> 03:57:19.000]  How many times does it have to be shown to you from their own text that it's a coordinated
[03:57:19.000 --> 03:57:20.000]  belief and agenda?
[03:57:20.000 --> 03:57:23.199]  Now, I want to remind you guys, head on over to my website and you can see the upcoming
[03:57:23.199 --> 03:57:24.539]  live events.
[03:57:24.539 --> 03:57:27.480]  Under any one of those posts, it will list the live events.
[03:57:27.480 --> 03:57:31.640]  We got July 6th in Los Angeles together with Jamie Kennedy from Screen.
[03:57:31.640 --> 03:57:33.680]  You've seen Jamie Kennedy and other friends of mine.
[03:57:33.680 --> 03:57:34.680]  We'll be doing lectures.
[03:57:34.680 --> 03:57:35.680]  We'll be doing stand up.
[03:57:35.680 --> 03:57:38.080]  We'll be doing a lot of fun things.
[03:57:38.080 --> 03:57:39.400]  We got many live events.

[03:59:23.160 --> 03:59:28.360]  my eyes is a composite overview of nutritional supplements that will keep
[03:59:28.360 --> 03:59:32.560]  you alive. And I would urge everyone, maybe you don't take vitamins, maybe you
[03:59:32.560 --> 03:59:36.400]  don't take nutritional supplements, but the day will come. Vitamin C and zinc,
[03:59:36.440 --> 03:59:41.120]  absolutely imperative for the cold. DNA force, absolutely imperative. Mineral fusion,
[03:59:41.120 --> 03:59:46.000]  absolutely. As you're drinking filtered water, a lot of it will become demineralized. You have
[03:59:46.000 --> 03:59:54.520]  to have these products. If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
