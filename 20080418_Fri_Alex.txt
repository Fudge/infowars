[00:00.000 --> 00:07.360]  mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex
[00:07.360 --> 00:25.360]  Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:25.360 --> 00:37.640]  Welcome, my friends. Welcome. It is Friday, the 18th day of April 2008. We're gonna be
[00:37.640 --> 00:42.440]  live here for the next three hours. And let me tell you about who we have joining us on
[00:42.440 --> 00:48.760]  the transmission today. Gold went up even more today and futures has it going up another
[00:48.760 --> 00:56.920]  $4 or $5 in the next week. So, moving back towards that $1,000 mark quite rapidly, Bob
[00:56.920 --> 01:02.880]  Chapman will be on to talk to us about that. And now, mainstream news starting to not talk
[01:02.880 --> 01:08.200]  about recession, admitting we're in recession, and moving on to depression talk. And the
[01:08.200 --> 01:13.400]  bigger issue will be, what will the U.S. look like if there is a depression? How will the
[01:13.400 --> 01:18.600]  population respond? And is that why they've got the FEMA camps prepared and the police
[01:18.600 --> 01:25.520]  trained for martial law? Bob Chapman, financial expert, will be joining us coming up in the
[01:25.520 --> 01:31.940]  second hour. William Lewis from one to three for two hours, his new film, it just came
[01:31.940 --> 01:36.560]  out about a week ago. I had a chance to see it a couple nights ago. We immediately began
[01:36.560 --> 01:41.640]  carrying it. And William had us 600 of these shipped within two days. They just arrived
[01:41.640 --> 01:50.480]  yesterday. They are now up on the infowars.com shopping cart. Washington, you're fired. And
[01:50.480 --> 01:57.480]  I have to say, it's what I'd call America freedom to fascism too. But it's even got
[01:57.480 --> 02:02.680]  better editing, better cameras are used. I'm not saying it's better than freedom to fascism.
[02:02.680 --> 02:08.760]  I would say it's a nice part two or it's a nice complement to it. And we need this film
[02:08.760 --> 02:15.600]  to be as big as America freedom to fascism. William Lewis, of course, did a great job
[02:15.600 --> 02:24.600]  on films like America under siege and another film that he did with Joyce Riley that was
[02:24.600 --> 02:31.440]  along the lines of what's happening with the secret testing on the American people beyond
[02:31.440 --> 02:36.040]  treason. And you can see how great his editing and work is there. And he's now off on his
[02:36.040 --> 02:41.320]  own making films entirely on his own. And I think this is his best film, Washington.
[02:41.320 --> 02:48.640]  You are fired. And we will have him on. We'll play some audio clips today from the film.
[02:48.640 --> 02:55.280]  The video trailer is up on infowars.com. William Lewis will be joining us today coming up in
[02:55.280 --> 03:02.080]  the third and fourth hour. There's now a fourth hour. And officially next week, we will be
[03:02.080 --> 03:11.240]  on the network for the four hours starting next week from 11 a.m. till 3 p.m. Central
[03:11.240 --> 03:20.680]  Standard Time. You will be able to tune in and hear the show for four hours.
[03:20.680 --> 03:26.920]  Yesterday I went for four and a half hours or no, it was four hours, 50 minutes, I think.
[03:26.920 --> 03:32.400]  Some days I go two hours over and make it a five hour show. Some days I've gotten close to six hours,
[03:32.400 --> 03:38.280]  but it will be locked in four hours official on the network. And some days you can be assured.
[03:38.280 --> 03:44.760]  I'll go into hyper overdrive myself with my own studio here, my own phone number is here,
[03:44.760 --> 03:48.240]  and I'll go over sometimes. Sometimes we'll have exclusive guests. We will still have
[03:48.240 --> 03:57.400]  overtime pushing the show past four hours. Now, you can always listen for free on the
[03:57.400 --> 04:04.480]  internet at infowars.com to the radio show there on the internet streams if it's not on your
[04:04.480 --> 04:11.200]  AM or FM dial or shortwave or satellite. And you can see the video in the fourth hour and beyond
[04:11.200 --> 04:17.320]  when you have a prisonplanet.tv membership for 15 cents a day. The document cam,
[04:17.320 --> 04:23.960]  the guest cam, the cam on me, a internet cam feed where we play videos and we show you the
[04:23.960 --> 04:31.960]  articles we're covering. And of course you then get all 18 of my films in super high quality,
[04:31.960 --> 04:35.920]  my book, Paul Watson's book, my weekly TV reports, my best audio interviews,
[04:35.920 --> 04:42.240]  prisonplanet.tv, now even more reasons to be a prisonplanet.tv member. Okay,
[04:42.240 --> 04:48.120]  I'm gonna try not to get upset today because my back is out of alignment in my neck,
[04:48.120 --> 04:58.200]  but the news I've got is unbelievable. Strap yourselves in. It is a big idea. A new world order.
[04:58.200 --> 05:04.800]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government. It's known as the
[05:04.800 --> 05:12.720]  Bilderberg. Could their objective be world domination? For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now
[05:12.720 --> 05:19.440]  as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is
[05:19.440 --> 05:27.960]  at hand. For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[05:27.960 --> 05:33.160]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda. Bilderberg is making
[05:33.160 --> 05:36.760]  great progress toward a world government. Most people have no idea. They're not after money.
[05:36.760 --> 05:40.920]  They have all the money they need. They're after power. Yes, they're after easy. Order in-game

[08:31.280 --> 08:35.440]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday. We got Bob Chapman with the Economic News,
[08:35.440 --> 08:39.520]  as I said earlier, coming up the next hour. Then William Lewis, new film, just amazing.
[08:40.080 --> 08:46.400]  We're carrying it. I think it's the new freedom to fascism. We're carrying it at infowars.com.
[08:46.400 --> 08:53.920]  It is just now available. In fact, it's not going to be in stores for a few weeks, just like American
[08:53.920 --> 08:59.360]  Drug War that I consulted on. It's been airing on Showtime, but this has three hours of extras.
[08:59.360 --> 09:03.440]  It wasn't going to be a miniseries, so really you're getting the miniseries for 2495,
[09:03.440 --> 09:10.960]  the film and the miniseries. That's not out until May 28th. Guess who has it? No one else has it.
[09:10.960 --> 09:17.200]  I have American Drug War as part of my deal to consult on it, and I'm discounting it out of the
[09:17.200 --> 09:26.560]  gate because it's going to be sold for $29.95, $24.95, infowars.com right now. I realize I've
[09:26.560 --> 09:30.800]  been lacking in plugging the books and videos we carry, and that's probably the most successful
[09:30.800 --> 09:37.760]  weapon we've got in the Info War is the truth, and we are a visible society. We are a society that
[09:37.760 --> 09:47.680]  watches television, watches films for our education, not reading. Very small percentage of people even
[09:47.680 --> 09:53.840]  read one book a year. It's less than 10 percent. Well, these are the new books of our age, the new
[09:55.840 --> 10:05.760]  Thomas Payne Screeds, and they need to be seen, the new common senses of our age.
[10:05.760 --> 10:11.680]  American Drug War, the last white hope. We have met the enemy, and it is our government exposing
[10:11.680 --> 10:17.040]  government drug dealing, all of it. Now it's complete and total fraud and scam, and how prescription
[10:17.040 --> 10:24.240]  drugs kill 300,000 plus a year. Well, marijuana kills no one, but they spend hundreds of billions
[10:24.240 --> 10:29.840]  a year, quote, fighting it because it potheads make for good little slaves in the private prisons
[10:29.840 --> 10:36.000]  owned by the banks that launder the drug money, and it's all documented. American Drug War, the
[10:36.000 --> 10:43.600]  last white hope. Showing on Showtime, but you can get the extra three hours that were too hardcore
[10:43.600 --> 10:50.160]  for Showtime, and again, William Lewis's new film, Washington You're Fired, but this is kind of like
[10:50.160 --> 10:54.320]  the person you try to kick out, you know, the runner you try to kick out, who's got their dogs
[10:54.320 --> 11:00.640]  going all over the floor and putting stack and garbage up in the garage, rats everywhere. You
[11:00.640 --> 11:07.200]  know, the woman is running a brothel out of the house. This is a true story I'm telling. I've
[11:07.200 --> 11:11.200]  got some family that rented a rent house out in the country, and the nightmare stories they've told
[11:11.200 --> 11:17.360]  me about it. These people for a couple months, like three or four months, wouldn't pay their rent,
[11:17.360 --> 11:22.400]  and finally when they kicked them out, had the sheriff throw them out, they had were too lazy
[11:22.400 --> 11:29.200]  to walk about 60 yards and put trash in the dumpster. So the communal dumpster in the country,
[11:29.200 --> 11:36.080]  so they just put it in the garage, the four car garage, a large garage, this is a country house
[11:36.080 --> 11:41.600]  where they work on tractors and things. When my uncle Houston lived in the house decades ago before
[11:41.600 --> 11:49.360]  he died, a nice little house, and they just stacked, I'm already digressing, just baby diapers, trash,
[11:49.360 --> 11:56.240]  everything to the ceiling, and then the whole house was filled with garbage, and the woman was
[11:56.240 --> 12:03.520]  whoring while the other guy worked as a part-time truck driver, just a hellish situation, and they
[12:03.520 --> 12:10.240]  had other scum renters before that as the country degenerates, but I think of that as our government,
[12:10.240 --> 12:17.360]  just just toothless scum that won't get out of our faces and takes trillions of dollars of our money
[12:17.360 --> 12:23.280]  over the last 50 years to propagandize us and tell us how good they are. It's disgusting.
[12:25.840 --> 12:31.120]  No common sense in history knows what you are, and the people are slowly discovering the pair
[12:31.120 --> 12:35.760]  all they're in, and then when you make your big move to take all the bank accounts and the pension
[12:35.760 --> 12:41.440]  funds, you're going to fall like Chell Chescue, but criminals never stop, and you're not going to stop,
[12:41.440 --> 12:48.320]  are you? So go ahead and have your way with this, but in the end, you're going to lose.
[12:48.320 --> 12:53.920]  All right, here's the news in front of me today. Yesterday, a caller called in from Tennessee,
[12:53.920 --> 13:02.000]  and he said that he's in Memphis, and that the local papers reported that the hundreds of deputies
[13:02.000 --> 13:07.040]  have been federalized, that are now federal police, basically, and that they just randomly
[13:07.040 --> 13:11.920]  ran out on the streets and had checkpoints and pulled people over and stopped people on the
[13:11.920 --> 13:16.960]  streets and no Fourth Amendment, just Nazi Germany. That's how it is, just cops roving,
[13:16.960 --> 13:23.200]  randomly checking IDs as they do in New York, as they do in LA, Chicago, and they said it was to
[13:23.200 --> 13:27.920]  fight terrorism, and then they arrested you if you had warrants for speeding or if you didn't
[13:27.920 --> 13:35.040]  have insurance, and they brag about it. And sure enough, I forgot about it till this morning,
[13:35.040 --> 13:39.280]  and I Googled it and found a bunch of news, but didn't just find it in Tennessee, I found it all
[13:39.280 --> 13:44.240]  over the country. Now, we already knew this was happening, but the bigger issue was sheriff's
[13:44.240 --> 13:47.280]  deputies told him that, yeah, they're being told to get ready for martial law. Well, I've had
[13:48.640 --> 13:55.200]  managers, one guy manages what was at 14 universities, 14 campuses in a university
[13:55.200 --> 13:59.120]  system to be technical, and he said, yeah, they're trying everybody for martial law,
[13:59.120 --> 14:05.600]  had him on a few years ago. It's the same everywhere. That's the new job. The criminals
[14:05.600 --> 14:10.480]  that ship in the drugs and carry out the terror attacks, own the private policing agencies in
[14:10.480 --> 14:15.760]  the prisons, and they just literally are going to own things as kingpins, like out of something
[14:15.760 --> 14:20.480]  out of escape from New York. You know, it's the mayor, it's the Duke, he's a number one.
[14:21.840 --> 14:27.600]  Law enforcement agencies joined together for anti-terrorism initiative. This is out of the
[14:27.600 --> 14:31.680]  commercial appeal, that's the name of the paper in Memphis, the major daily paper,
[14:32.880 --> 14:37.040]  and it just shows them that said fighting terrorism with images of them pulling people
[14:37.040 --> 14:44.400]  over in their cars. See, you're the terrorist. There's no real terrorist. Overnight, they flipped
[14:44.400 --> 14:50.160]  it from, quote, brown skinned men in caves with turbines and beards to blonde-air blue-eyed al-Qaeda
[14:50.160 --> 14:57.840]  there everywhere. You see? But they never flipped it. In secret, we always had the documents where
[14:57.840 --> 15:02.880]  it was gun owners, Christians, people that make frequent references to the Constitution. Those
[15:02.880 --> 15:07.840]  who believe Jesus Christ is returning are all considered terrorist cult members who need to
[15:07.840 --> 15:14.720]  be, quote, reeducated in the words of Jan and Reno on 60 Minutes. Oh, you're going to reeducation
[15:14.720 --> 15:21.760]  camps. Your preacher's going to tell you to go. You think I'm joking, don't you? Folks, this is
[15:21.760 --> 15:31.360]  all going to come true. This is all going to happen. You'll have to see it, won't you?
[15:33.760 --> 15:37.760]  So, law enforcement agencies joined together for anti-terrorism initiative. We're going to cover
[15:37.760 --> 15:44.000]  that. And I found several Tennessee papers reporting similar things. TransLink has to
[15:44.000 --> 15:54.800]  rein in its Taser happy cops before someone is injured or killed. And it admits that if you do
[15:54.800 --> 16:00.160]  not have a metro card and because the people, I mean, it's like eight bucks up there to use it.
[16:00.720 --> 16:04.640]  It's like 10 bucks down many areas in New York. But I looked it up at seven bucks in the city
[16:04.640 --> 16:08.560]  where this is happening. A lot of people don't have the money and they walk up to you and they
[16:08.560 --> 16:14.800]  taser you as punishment. It's called paying compliance. It's like the Polish guy panicking
[16:14.800 --> 16:18.320]  as they tased him. They jumped on top of his head with their knees. They break his neck right
[16:18.320 --> 16:23.440]  there on the tape and they hold him up and his head's low and all around. And it's like that
[16:23.440 --> 16:27.520]  woman they killed. They said she choked herself with her handcuffs that were behind her.
[16:30.160 --> 16:33.520]  Hey cops, you think you can get away with that type of evil and there aren't bigger criminals
[16:33.520 --> 16:40.960]  above you that aren't going to abuse you? They're abusing you right now. Now you won't care when
[16:40.960 --> 16:46.960]  your kid's dumbed down or has a learning disability or God forbid has autism or dies of a brain
[16:46.960 --> 16:50.720]  tumor from all the shots you give them and the water you feed them. You give them a drink.
[16:50.720 --> 16:56.640]  But you are going to care when they destroy your family's future. You may end up having
[16:56.640 --> 17:00.880]  okay checks, but everybody else in your family is going to be totally dashed at you. But that'll
[17:00.880 --> 17:05.120]  be all right. At Thanksgiving, everybody will kiss your butt at the table. And that's what this
[17:05.120 --> 17:11.920]  is all really about, getting an ego, isn't it? Well, don't worry. Don't worry. You always win.
[17:14.480 --> 17:16.960]  That's a trick. That's a lie. You don't really win.
[17:18.800 --> 17:24.960]  Ex-NFL player Taze for pointing at cop. The police walk up to the car. You hear him say,
[17:24.960 --> 17:28.240]  and the news is against him. They're using the worst parts of it and it's not even bad.
[17:28.240 --> 17:37.120]  And somebody's saying, come on, man, to the cop. So the former NFL star politely says,
[17:37.120 --> 17:42.320]  hey, let's handle this. He gets out of the car. The white officers have got shaved heads. They're
[17:42.320 --> 17:47.040]  all beefed up, but they're big guys, but you can see them. They're intimidated when he gets out.
[17:47.680 --> 17:52.080]  But the guy's gentle, giant. He's real friendly. He's, listen, I forgot to carry it with me,
[17:52.080 --> 17:59.200]  but here's who I am. And they start putting their hands on him and they're saying,
[17:59.200 --> 18:05.680]  settle down. And he does, he supplicates, he puts his hands together in the universal submission.
[18:05.680 --> 18:13.920]  He says, come on, man, please, everything's all right. And the cops charge him and run their
[18:13.920 --> 18:21.040]  arms into him. And he starts backing up, going, please don't, and they got tasers out. He turns
[18:21.040 --> 18:28.400]  to run and they tasering. And there's a wicked celebration on the news. There's a wicked celebration
[18:28.400 --> 18:34.080]  on the news about how, oh, listen to him cuss. Then he starts cussing after they've tasered him.
[18:35.120 --> 18:39.360]  He ran from police assaulting him and tasering him.
[18:44.160 --> 18:48.320]  And look, we got clips of him tasering blind people. We got clips of them
[18:48.320 --> 18:52.960]  throwing people out of wheelchairs who were completely paralyzed from the neck down and
[18:52.960 --> 18:57.840]  laughing. We got footage of them tasering 95 year old women. We got tasers, a stuff of a
[18:57.840 --> 19:01.760]  guy in a library without an ID. And he says, I don't have an ID. And they say, produce one.
[19:01.760 --> 19:04.880]  And he goes, look, I'm leaving. And they go, no, I'm going to tase you. And they tase him. And
[19:04.880 --> 19:11.920]  the school says, yes, we tase you for not answering questions. It's torture. And people die every
[19:11.920 --> 19:17.040]  day. I see someone dying from it. And I told you 10 years ago when these came out, because I read
[19:17.040 --> 19:24.400]  Pentagon documents, Colonel Alexander and others, where they say that they're going to train everybody
[19:24.400 --> 19:29.040]  with the images of police shooting and habitualize his shooting, they're going to move on just to
[19:29.040 --> 19:35.120]  guns. They're just going to blow you away because it's martial law. It's New Orleans.
[19:36.000 --> 19:40.240]  We're going to come back and cover it all, ladies and gentlemen, and the collapsing economy. The

[20:04.960 --> 20:11.280]  fighting to survive the treatment? Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning
[20:11.280 --> 20:18.800]  of your entire system are totally unnecessary? But now it's cancer's turn to die. With lace

[21:06.560 --> 21:11.920]  Is that their objective being world domination? For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[21:12.560 --> 21:18.560]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[21:18.560 --> 21:26.800]  of humanity is at hand. For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government

[24:07.280 --> 24:11.840]  Remember the illegal aliens get free health care. They're allowed to DWI drive. They don't
[24:11.840 --> 24:15.760]  have to have drivers license nothing. It's all just accepted. That's been admitted.
[24:18.320 --> 24:23.440]  But citizens get the book thrown at them. It's like you only see police in the wealthy areas
[24:23.440 --> 24:30.080]  writing everybody tickets. Everything's selectively enforced. Foreign drug dealers are allowed to
[24:30.080 --> 24:35.360]  invest money in the stock market. There's a special federal law for it. It's totally lawless. Now
[24:35.360 --> 24:42.960]  former NFL football player Timothy Worley was tasered by Georgia police for becoming
[24:42.960 --> 24:47.760]  confrontational as their quote at a traffic stop according to news reports. But the video shows
[24:47.760 --> 24:53.760]  the extent of Worley's aggression is merely pointing at the cop and raising his voice.
[24:55.120 --> 25:01.760]  And the cop, it's weird rushes up and pushes on him while he's saying please man with his hands
[25:01.760 --> 25:06.960]  together. It's really bizarre and it's because the cops are intimidated and there's a bunch of them.
[25:06.960 --> 25:11.600]  They wanted to kill him. I mean, that's the instinct. They got a big bear. They are in a
[25:11.600 --> 25:17.440]  predator mode. They feed on us as the predator class and that's the psychology and they were scared
[25:17.440 --> 25:23.040]  when this big guy gets out of his car. They're afraid and they had to be the tough guys. This
[25:23.040 --> 25:28.720]  was like a trophy for them and the black guys putting his hands together. He's saying please,
[25:28.720 --> 25:35.120]  please come on. And they're saying, don't get agitated. He's like, I'm not. Everything's all
[25:35.120 --> 25:41.040]  right. And so that's not enough. The cops, because they were afraid, it made them mad at him because
[25:41.040 --> 25:48.720]  it's all about the macho pipe dream they're part of. They run in and push on him and then he goes,
[25:48.720 --> 25:54.400]  whoa man, whoa. And then points his finger and the guy pulls a taser out and he turns to run
[25:54.400 --> 25:58.400]  and they taser him and they have a celebration on the news. Let's go ahead and play the audio of
[25:58.400 --> 26:05.360]  this. The video is up on infowars.com, prisonplanet.com. Former NFL running back and star UGA athlete is
[26:05.360 --> 26:11.360]  under arrest tonight, tasered by Smyrna police after becoming confrontational at a traffic stop.
[26:11.360 --> 26:16.720]  The entire incident caught on camera. Pittsburgh Steelers running back Tim Worley pulled over
[26:16.720 --> 26:24.480]  for speeding in a lane violation. He told the officer he had no ID. Worley's passengers intervening,
[26:24.480 --> 26:30.320]  prompting the officer to ask Worley to get out. Stop right there. I don't have any ID, sir.
[26:30.880 --> 26:37.040]  Listen to him. I don't have any ID, sir. And I looked up this guy's bio. He's not a gangbanger
[26:37.040 --> 26:42.240]  type, nice guy, good record. Doesn't matter. Get out of the car. And now he just starts
[26:42.240 --> 26:47.680]  being nice. He's like, there's no problem. And these guys are, no doubt it was because he was
[26:47.680 --> 26:52.800]  black folks. Here we go. Passengers intervening, prompting the officer to ask Worley to get out.
[26:52.800 --> 26:55.600]  But it was his gestures that sparked the confrontation.
[27:02.400 --> 27:07.120]  Worley then loses his cool. Stop right there. Now you watch the video.
[27:08.800 --> 27:14.480]  And the cops are sitting there, you know, in his face. And he's just got his hands making gestures
[27:14.480 --> 27:18.880]  right in front of him. They're not, he's not waving them out at his sides. I mean,
[27:18.880 --> 27:24.320]  it's classic body language of supplicating, of bootlicking, as Paul Watson points out.
[27:24.960 --> 27:30.240]  And that's not enough. He, he, he, he starts praying to him and the cop just rushes him.
[27:31.040 --> 27:34.960]  And, and, and, and, you know, that's aggressive, putting your hands in police or be reasonable.
[27:34.960 --> 27:38.320]  Cop didn't like hearing that. Didn't like you talking back to him, boy.
[27:39.680 --> 27:44.480]  Don't you pray to him. He is your God, but he doesn't like how you just prayed, boy.
[27:44.480 --> 27:48.720]  So now we're going to taser you with 50,000 volts and torture you and then have the news
[27:48.720 --> 27:53.120]  media lie about you and the cowardly public. So brainwashing, brain dead and brain damage
[27:53.120 --> 27:57.520]  from the chemical warfare attacks they're under that I'm serious slaves. You don't know what
[27:57.520 --> 28:02.720]  you're under that they'll watch this video and not, and not even see what the video shows.
[28:02.720 --> 28:08.400]  They'll just believe the news. Not now. Now he's begging. He's just a cop's are threatening.
[28:08.400 --> 28:15.120]  You make one more gesture to me, boy. And he's like, I'm not pleaser. Everything's okay. Oh,
[28:15.120 --> 28:20.400]  you don't pray to me. That's not the proper way to pray to God. And so the cop runs in,
[28:20.400 --> 28:28.320]  pushes him in the chest and the cop goes, uh, yeah. Then the NFL player goes, whoa, man.
[28:30.000 --> 28:34.800]  And then they pull out the taser and he turns to run and they have the victory against America,
[28:34.800 --> 28:39.520]  the victory against freedom, the victory against honor, the victory against decency.
[28:39.520 --> 28:42.400]  Goodness in America loses again. Play the tape.
[28:45.200 --> 28:46.800]  Worley then loses his cool.
[28:51.360 --> 28:53.040]  And watch what happens next.
[28:53.040 --> 29:03.760]  The officer tases Worley, sending him to the ground.
[29:05.120 --> 29:09.520]  Stop right there. They don't even say in the newscast that the cop assaults him.
[29:10.720 --> 29:15.760]  He's praying to him going, come on, let's be reasonable. And so the cop runs up and pushes
[29:15.760 --> 29:21.680]  his hands into him. Everybody's got to have cameras about on your cars, everything. And when
[29:21.680 --> 29:25.920]  they start doing this, you just got to lay down and put your hands behind your head. And I know
[29:25.920 --> 29:31.120]  because if not, they're going to set you up. Now the guy did do that in California University.
[29:31.120 --> 29:36.480]  They still tasered him, but it still, then they couldn't charge him with the assault charge.
[29:37.200 --> 29:41.520]  We'll come back. And look, I know all police aren't like this, but the bad ones are protected.
[29:41.520 --> 29:47.760]  The media backs you up. The system likes this. We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[29:47.760 --> 29:51.440]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[29:54.720 --> 29:59.360]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water. And did you know that you have
[29:59.360 --> 30:03.920]  greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water? That's
[30:03.920 --> 30:08.720]  because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin.
[30:08.720 --> 30:14.560]  The KDF dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold water and is designed to reduce chlorine,
[30:14.560 --> 30:20.240]  lead, mercury and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus.

[30:26.080 --> 30:30.400]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine,
[30:30.400 --> 30:35.360]  iron, heavy metals and bacteria. What about you? Order your KDF shower filter normally,

[30:54.160 --> 30:58.880]  Fact. Rapid industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution and its curse
[30:58.880 --> 31:03.760]  on world health is staggering. We live in a toxic world that is bombarded by seven new
[31:03.760 --> 31:08.640]  chemicals each day. The human body is amazing and efficient in design, but because of the
[31:08.640 --> 31:12.640]  polluted world in which we live is unable to remove all toxins.
[31:12.640 --> 31:17.600]  The solution. Detoxification integrated with electro-chip premiere energy foot spa.

[33:02.880 --> 33:05.520]  If it sounds like I hate the police,
[33:05.520 --> 33:15.520]  that's because it's true. I hate the system. I hate this corrupt system that's slowly twisted
[33:16.080 --> 33:21.040]  and turned our police from tough guys who are well respected and pretty much like,
[33:21.680 --> 33:27.200]  but that still had some corruption and problems, who literally had people bringing them coffee and
[33:27.200 --> 33:34.320]  pieces of pie and who were trusted to people that are now hated. That's what the system wants.
[33:34.320 --> 33:39.680]  They want you to act bad. They want everyone to know. So that then it's the people against the
[33:39.680 --> 33:46.320]  police and then they further compact into a gang psychosis, gang psychology. Behavioral
[33:46.320 --> 33:51.840]  psychologists are manipulating you. That's why they won't hire police with over 100 IQs in any
[33:51.840 --> 33:56.800]  major department in the United States. And please don't email me saying that's not true. If you just
[33:56.800 --> 34:01.680]  Google that, there's hundreds of mainstream news articles and lawsuits over it. Why won't they
[34:01.680 --> 34:07.920]  hire someone over 100 IQ? It's come out in Maryland and in Baltimore. It's come out in Houston
[34:07.920 --> 34:12.080]  because they found that you will not break the law. You will not violate the Constitution.
[34:12.640 --> 34:20.000]  Someone of above average IQ, above average intelligence is dangerous to a tyranny. That's
[34:20.000 --> 34:24.560]  why many departments now hire felons just like the military does. Oh, you didn't know that. Google
[34:24.560 --> 34:30.400]  that. We are shifting into a very dangerous time. These guys are coming back by the hundreds of
[34:30.400 --> 34:35.280]  thousands every year from Iraq. They've been running real checkpoints, real door to door.
[34:35.280 --> 34:42.160]  They're in combat mode. Most of them have PTSD and they're looking for a fight. And man, they pull
[34:42.160 --> 34:47.520]  over this NFL running back and this guy gets out. His body language, he keeps his hands in close to
[34:47.520 --> 34:55.200]  his chest in a pleading. He's being reasonable. And then the cop pushes him. He has his hands
[34:55.200 --> 35:02.800]  going pleaser and the cop calls that putting his fist together and shoves him. And then he
[35:02.800 --> 35:09.280]  cusses at him and says, man, what is your problem? And then he sees the taser and the guy tries to
[35:09.280 --> 35:15.200]  run. He tries to run from physical assault. It's not enough. You get to push him around, get to be
[35:15.200 --> 35:21.440]  a big man. Yeah, I like to see you go start a fight with that big black guy, you know, just out in
[35:21.440 --> 35:24.560]  the field somewhere. Why don't you call him up if you're such a big man and say, hey, come on,
[35:24.560 --> 35:30.000]  let's go have a fight out in the field with just our fist. No, you had to prove you were a big
[35:30.000 --> 35:36.400]  game hunter hunting man. You're real big and bad. Now, when the black guy gets out, they're scared
[35:36.400 --> 35:42.000]  because their health kite is everywhere and they teach the cops to be afraid. And cops didn't
[35:42.000 --> 35:47.600]  used to be like that in the past. I remember famous cases, you'd have somebody up in a bell
[35:47.600 --> 35:52.080]  tower shooting people or somebody in a school holding hostages, first cops on the scenes.
[35:52.080 --> 35:57.200]  They'd be wearing short sleeve shirts and slacks. They'd go in there with a revolver. They'd go in
[35:57.200 --> 36:04.240]  and they'd kill the son of a bitch every single time. You couldn't stop them because they were
[36:04.240 --> 36:08.880]  real men. They weren't these fake cops who just shake with fear and have been taught all these
[36:08.880 --> 36:14.400]  procedures where they wait four hours and 15 minutes at Columbine, three hours and 40 something
[36:14.400 --> 36:21.600]  minutes in Virginia while the feds arrive and you see cops waddling around, putting body armor on,
[36:21.600 --> 36:26.000]  three hours into the event while somebody's in there shooting everybody having their way.
[36:33.040 --> 36:38.480]  You couldn't stop police in the past and there weren't very many cops, but if a car got stolen,
[36:38.480 --> 36:44.800]  they investigated. If your house got robbed, they investigated. That was a shooter. Of course,
[36:44.800 --> 36:49.680]  the citizens were different too. Citizens would charge in and kill somebody in minutes who was
[36:49.680 --> 36:56.320]  in a school or in a church or in a business and the police trusted the people and the people trusted
[36:56.320 --> 37:01.040]  the police and everybody drove around with guns and their gun racks even in New York and Illinois
[37:01.600 --> 37:08.480]  just 30 years ago, just 10 years ago in Texas, but then TV and the culture and the social messages
[37:08.480 --> 37:14.560]  taught everybody that we were each other's enemies and that you can't trust the citizens and you
[37:14.560 --> 37:21.360]  can't trust the police and the incredible part about this is this cop shoves this guy for pleading.
[37:23.600 --> 37:27.680]  He's talking to the cop. The cops are all agitated and then they've edited out what the cops are
[37:27.680 --> 37:31.040]  yelling, but you can hear the end of them yelling. You can see the tape being cut. You know, they're
[37:31.040 --> 37:35.040]  cutting out the cops. It just keeps cutting back to him going. The cops are all bowed up around
[37:35.040 --> 37:38.640]  him. I want to see the unedited tape. You know it's going to come out as lawyers are going to get it
[37:38.640 --> 37:43.200]  or maybe sometimes the cops just erased the original to cover it up, but still you can see
[37:43.200 --> 37:48.320]  they've edited it. But even with the edits, he's going, come on, man. He's pleading and then they
[37:48.320 --> 37:54.000]  cut, cut, cut. And he says, you make your fist one more time and he goes, please, please. And,
[37:54.000 --> 37:59.360]  man, the cop doesn't like him begging him. He puts his hands together, prays to him.
[38:01.440 --> 38:09.120]  I mean, the symbol of supplication, of bowing down. He even leans forward and nods his head,
[38:09.120 --> 38:17.040]  please sir, please boss, please master, please, please. That's not enough. And I found with
[38:17.040 --> 38:23.600]  police when you submit, that's when they go wild. If you childishly beg them, they freak out. I've
[38:23.600 --> 38:27.680]  said it's like the same training they give us. They've gone through. It's like dog training.
[38:27.680 --> 38:36.880]  You talk very firmly and very slowly. Do not violate my rights. You are in the wrong.
[38:36.880 --> 38:42.000]  But actually, when he says to him, do what you got to do, that's exactly what I said when I was
[38:42.000 --> 38:52.480]  at the Willie Nelson concert. That's exactly what I said. There's literally thousands of cameras,
[38:53.360 --> 38:57.280]  thousands. They're just everywhere flashing. We've got still cameras taking pictures.
[38:57.280 --> 39:07.440]  And I'm there and I'm sitting up there and I'm walking back and forth getting people drinks,
[39:07.440 --> 39:10.960]  you know, because I had invited guests there. So I'm going down and getting people drinks,
[39:10.960 --> 39:18.320]  bringing them back up. And security stops me to go, you're Alex Jones, aren't you? Hey,
[39:18.320 --> 39:22.240]  you like the show? Where were you sitting? And I noticed I came back and we were all kind of
[39:22.240 --> 39:25.840]  looking at me. And then 30 minutes later, I go to get some, you know, the kids, some food.
[39:25.840 --> 39:31.360]  And I come back and my son had the little camera taking pictures. He loves to take pictures of
[39:31.360 --> 39:34.640]  the digital camera. It's not like 35 millimeter where it's a waste. He can just take picture after
[39:34.640 --> 39:39.920]  picture. And there's this woman yelling at my dad and other people and she's got security guards with
[39:39.920 --> 39:43.760]  her. And I said, it's okay. They're like, no, we have to take that camera. And I said, but
[39:43.760 --> 39:48.960]  there's cameras all over, see them flashing. And they just said, literally, they're just flashing
[39:48.960 --> 39:54.080]  everywhere. And they just said, well, we're taking it. And I said, well, no, that's not reasonable.
[39:54.080 --> 39:58.800]  Go get your supervisor. And then they come back and they're all sitting there freaking out on me.
[39:58.800 --> 40:03.120]  And I just said, look, I said, do what you got to do. But I promise you, I'm going to sue you
[40:03.120 --> 40:07.680]  individually. You do this to my family. This is selective enforcement. This woman knows who I
[40:07.680 --> 40:13.680]  am. And she's like, you bet I do. They were freaking out. They were going to get Alex Jones.
[40:13.680 --> 40:18.080]  See, everything's about selective enforcement. There were no signs saying no photography.
[40:18.080 --> 40:23.040]  Everybody was taking pictures. But it was about them winning, them showing me.
[40:23.040 --> 40:27.440]  But I calmly just said, do what you got to do. But I promise you, you can beat the wrap, but
[40:27.440 --> 40:32.560]  you're not going to beat the ride. And I said, you know, this is selective enforcement. And the
[40:32.560 --> 40:36.720]  head DPS guy just said, yeah, you're right. Just don't take any more pictures. Come on.
[40:36.720 --> 40:42.880]  That woman got so mad, went down the hall, griping at him. And I saw my dad about to take
[40:42.880 --> 40:46.880]  pictures again. And I said, do not do it. And he goes, but everybody is taking pictures. People in
[40:46.880 --> 40:52.240]  this very, very group of bleachers. And I said, it doesn't matter dad. They want to get us. You
[40:52.240 --> 40:59.440]  understand? Don't take pictures. Because that woman was just standing there watching the whole
[40:59.440 --> 41:05.440]  time. She was going to show Alex Jones, the American Al Qaeda. She watches Fox News. I need
[41:05.440 --> 41:11.760]  to be tasered. I need to be arrested. So I don't hate you, police. But when I see you wrong,
[41:11.760 --> 41:21.040]  someone like this guy that groveled to you. And this is what the tape edited. Who knows what's
[41:21.040 --> 41:27.200]  really on the tape? Play the audio straight through without me interrupting it.
[41:28.800 --> 41:35.200]  Former NFL running back and star UGA athlete is under arrest tonight, tasered by Smyrna police
[41:35.200 --> 41:40.880]  after becoming confrontational at a traffic stop. The entire incident caught on camera.
[41:40.880 --> 41:45.200]  Pittsburgh Steelers running back Tim Worley pulled over for speeding in a lane violation.
[41:45.200 --> 41:52.000]  He told the officer he had no ID. Worley's passengers intervening, prompting the officer
[41:52.000 --> 41:56.480]  to ask Worley to get out. But it was his gestures that sparked the confrontation.
[42:03.280 --> 42:04.800]  Worley then loses his cool.
[42:04.800 --> 42:11.120]  And watch what happens next.
[42:19.200 --> 42:21.920]  The officer tases Worley, sending him to the ground.
[42:25.600 --> 42:31.040]  The confrontation escalates as backup arrives. Worley's stringing one profanity after another.
[42:31.040 --> 42:37.840]  Stop right there. The confrontation escalates. Next time you get mugged, somebody mugs your
[42:37.840 --> 42:43.120]  grandmother who's 85 years old and beats her head in. Expect the cops, according to this logic,
[42:43.120 --> 42:49.760]  to come and say, oh, she was in a confrontation. She escalated. They're assaulting him. They're
[42:49.760 --> 42:57.280]  multiple times tasing him. And he's on the ground cussing at them. And they imply he
[42:57.280 --> 43:02.560]  deserves it because he's cussing. Oh, you won't give a urine sample when you're in the hospital.
[43:02.560 --> 43:07.600]  They tase you. Oh, you didn't pay for your fare on the bus or the train. We're going to tase you.
[43:08.400 --> 43:12.480]  Oh, you're protesting and you won't get up off the sidewalk. We're going to tase you or break
[43:12.480 --> 43:18.720]  your arm till you get up. I have videos of this. Torture is legal in this country. They do it all
[43:18.720 --> 43:24.000]  the time. And I had Austin cops come up to me a few months ago and I was protesting Rick Perry
[43:24.000 --> 43:27.200]  for going to Bilderberg Group, violating federal law. And they just came up and said, we're going
[43:27.200 --> 43:30.240]  to arrest you if you don't leave. And I said, go ahead, First Amendment. You lose suits all the
[43:30.240 --> 43:38.480]  time. They had the riot cops suiting up and getting their tasers out. And I had to preach to the cops.
[43:38.480 --> 43:42.320]  I had to go, you're all getting sued. Every commander here, you're going to beat the rat,
[43:42.320 --> 43:50.240]  but you can't beat the ride. And the cops started arguing saying, you know, I could hear them arguing.
[43:50.240 --> 43:57.040]  They were arguing with each other. And then at a high level, a captain shows up and comes over
[43:57.040 --> 44:04.240]  to me and it's all on YouTube. I mean, it's just disgusting, ladies and gentlemen, trying to cheat
[44:04.240 --> 44:09.520]  me out of my First Amendment. That's the big one. The Bill of Rights, that's what the whole country
[44:09.520 --> 44:14.000]  is founded on. Those are the big laws. You're breaking them. That's called being a tyrant.
[44:14.000 --> 44:23.840]  Threatening me with false arrest if I don't. And thank God, Austin's lost scores of losses. They
[44:23.840 --> 44:29.920]  just lost one last month. They were arresting anti-war people for standing with signs on
[44:29.920 --> 44:37.440]  street corners and they lost a suit again. Our money. Stop violating us. But the bigger issue
[44:37.440 --> 44:46.080]  here is the sickening media. Play that, play the end part where they talk about, oh, the
[44:46.080 --> 44:57.520]  confrontation got worse. The cops push him. He's begging. The officer tases Worley, sending him
[44:57.520 --> 45:06.800]  to the ground. The confrontation escalates as backup arrives. Worley stringing one profanity
[45:06.800 --> 45:15.280]  after another is arrested and taken into custody. Yes. What do you do when your finger gets slammed
[45:15.280 --> 45:19.280]  by a hammer when you're driving nails? What do you do when you cut yourself cutting tomatoes?
[45:21.040 --> 45:25.600]  Well, how about 50,000 volts repeatedly pumped into you as he stands there on the ground with
[45:25.600 --> 45:30.560]  his hand out saying, please don't. And they taze at him again and again and again. It's clear from
[45:30.560 --> 45:40.960]  the tape. A celebration of evil, of winning. Oh, you're winning. Well, you know what? He
[45:40.960 --> 45:45.600]  still goes home to his millions. He still goes on to his family. He was smart enough not to touch
[45:45.600 --> 45:52.240]  you even when you assaulted him and he'll beat you in court and he's the better man. And I know
[45:52.240 --> 46:01.760]  you hate that. I know that upset you that he's got more money than you. All of it. Because the cops
[46:01.760 --> 46:06.480]  doing this are thugs. They're shames to this country. And what's even more shameful is that the
[46:06.480 --> 46:13.200]  media would defend it. That the media would say it was okay. I want everybody to get this story
[46:13.200 --> 46:19.120]  from prisonplanet.com out to everyone they know. XNFL player Tazard for pointing at cop.
[46:19.120 --> 46:26.880]  You gotta go watch this video. They shove him. He's going please.
[46:30.080 --> 46:36.240]  Please. And see, it's the cops order. That's the God complex. I told you not to
[46:37.360 --> 46:41.360]  do something with your hands. You didn't follow my order. I get to shove you now.
[46:42.000 --> 46:46.800]  And there's cops right behind me with guns. That's the whole plan. We can trick you into
[46:46.800 --> 46:55.760]  fighting back like a man. You better lay there like a wimp to me. I'm gonna kill you. XNFL player
[46:55.760 --> 46:58.960]  and then see when it's black cops in LA. They could do this to white guys.
[46:59.600 --> 47:03.600]  So that's how this works. It only makes the world worse and worse. Like when I was going to the TSA.
[47:05.600 --> 47:11.840]  Big black guys. You know, I don't ever take my shoes off. I always try to go through without
[47:11.840 --> 47:17.120]  doing it. And they go, hey, take your shoes off. And I said, you know, I really don't like the
[47:17.120 --> 47:22.080]  athlete's foot that's on this ground. You know, this isn't what you see. They all make you freak
[47:22.080 --> 47:26.960]  out about sanitary and who wipe your hands and all this to make you habitually, you know, obsessive
[47:26.960 --> 47:30.960]  compulsive, but walking across where tens of thousands of people walk from every other third
[47:30.960 --> 47:36.240]  world country. That's okay. And so I said, well, real, real nicely. Well, I really don't like
[47:36.240 --> 47:42.800]  uh, walking across this, you know, uh, it's, it'll, you know, it'll infect you. And he said, oh,
[47:42.800 --> 47:48.560]  Mr. Stinky feet doesn't like it. Come on over here, Mr. Stinky feet. You like it, Mr. Stinky feet.
[47:48.560 --> 47:52.720]  I'm gonna wave this wand over in their lab because he got some, he got some stinky feet.
[47:56.160 --> 47:59.520]  And actually I didn't hate him at that point. I felt sorry for him. I realized
[47:59.520 --> 48:03.200]  they're under chemical attack. They're under biological attack. They've been
[48:03.200 --> 48:09.040]  enslaved their whole lives for scores of generations since they came over on slave ships.
[48:09.760 --> 48:15.040]  I just felt sorry for him in the death of this country. And I feel sorry for those shaved head
[48:15.040 --> 48:20.400]  white cops too. They're just, they have no idea they're under eugenics attack publicly documented.
[48:21.120 --> 48:25.520]  Their kids, you know, they just laugh at me. Their kids sit there being brain damaged every day,
[48:25.520 --> 48:28.560]  brushing their teeth and wrinking the water. They're not going to stop. And I have all the
[48:28.560 --> 48:33.280]  documents and made films about it. They're not going to check into there's going to laugh at me.
[48:33.840 --> 48:37.200]  The blacks are going to go through all this. The whites, it doesn't matter. We're all just
[48:37.200 --> 48:48.160]  pathetic slaves. X NFL player Timothy Worsley was tasered by Georgia police for becoming
[48:48.160 --> 48:52.720]  confrontational at a traffic stop. According to news reports, but the video shows that the
[48:52.720 --> 48:58.160]  extent of Worsley's aggression, Worley's aggression was merely pointing at the cop and raising his
[48:58.160 --> 49:04.160]  voice. After being shoved, Paul, you might want to add that. After seeing Paul can't even write
[49:04.160 --> 49:09.760]  these as bad as it is. After Worley exits the vehicle and appears calm, the cowardly officer
[49:09.760 --> 49:16.240]  accuses him of making fist when Worley is doing no more than crossing his arms. He's begging Paul.
[49:17.120 --> 49:24.800]  Yeah, he's crossing him at first, which is a sign of submission, but a sign of defensiveness also
[49:24.800 --> 49:29.760]  of like, I'm a turtle in my shell. I'm being defensive. Knowing it's a threat. I mean, this
[49:29.760 --> 49:32.880]  guy's not stupid. He knows he's dealing with life and death right now with Scott.
[49:35.760 --> 49:39.440]  Yeah, you ought to follow that cop around, see what meetings he goes to, who he hangs out with,
[49:40.000 --> 49:45.040]  what affiliations he has. I think you'll find something. Apparently incorrect body language
[49:45.040 --> 49:50.560]  is now an offense that justifies pain compliance correction by means of tasering.
[49:50.560 --> 49:56.000]  Worley even puts his palms together in a prayer-like pose and attempt to reassure the officer he is
[49:56.000 --> 50:02.000]  calm, but that is not good enough. After Worley points at the cop for half a second, the officer
[50:02.000 --> 50:07.360]  then approaches Worley, who backs away, but is then tasered. Well, he shoves him. Yeah,
[50:08.080 --> 50:14.160]  you watch the video, he shoves him. Oh, you didn't take it. You backed away from being assaulted.
[50:14.160 --> 50:19.440]  What should Worley's correct body language have been to avoid a 50,000-volt shooting through his
[50:19.440 --> 50:24.800]  body? Should he have kneeled and licked the officer's boots while he was being lectured?
[50:24.800 --> 50:29.520]  Why are police being trained that simply talking to cops or pointing a finger is evidence of an
[50:29.520 --> 50:34.320]  imminent physical threat? Well, the guy's screaming, you make this one more time.
[50:36.000 --> 50:40.720]  Perhaps Worley's behavior was deserving a little torture when compared to the revelation
[50:40.720 --> 50:45.120]  that the Greater Vancouver Transportation Authority police service tasers passengers who
[50:45.120 --> 50:51.040]  dodge their fares. I'll be right back. Our beloved Republic is on her knees. The forces of globalism
[50:51.040 --> 50:55.600]  are destroying national sovereignty worldwide, but in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[50:55.600 --> 51:00.400]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up. It is essential that patriots
[51:00.400 --> 51:05.040]  worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the new world order masterpieces,
[51:05.040 --> 51:11.360]  we have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[52:52.080 --> 52:58.160]  Gasoline prices are out of control. Are you tired of giving your hard-earned
[52:58.160 --> 53:02.000]  dollars to the major oil companies? Did you know that the oil companies have developed
[53:02.000 --> 53:06.640]  special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles? Very few consumers even know such
[53:06.640 --> 53:11.760]  products exist. SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing that the major oil
[53:11.760 --> 53:16.320]  companies have run. Yet they don't want you to know about them. This product is made right here
[53:16.320 --> 53:20.640]  in the United States and is not a typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[53:20.640 --> 53:27.040]  SFR lasts up to six months. SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[53:27.040 --> 53:31.920]  SFR recently ran this ad and the response from all over the United States was so strong

[54:19.520 --> 54:24.000]  Everybody in the back office is freaking out watching the video, this former NFL guy.
[54:24.880 --> 54:31.920]  As the cops screaming at him, he nicely folds his arms, supplicating, folds them, kind of like,
[54:31.920 --> 54:36.160]  you know, from a coach screaming at him, the training to submit to it, kind of kneels his head
[54:36.160 --> 54:42.480]  down. It's so sad to watch. And then he just screams, don't you make fist at me. So he undoes
[54:42.480 --> 54:48.240]  him and puts his hands together and says, please, please. And man, the cop then rushes in, shoves
[54:48.240 --> 54:52.080]  him, and he goes, okay, he starts yelling at him. And then the tasering starts, he runs.
[54:53.120 --> 55:01.600]  I mean, it's so evil, but the news, you know, they taser him and then it escalates.
[55:01.600 --> 55:03.920]  How dare him cuss as he's being tasered.
[55:07.680 --> 55:11.440]  You know, I love it. Whenever somebody abuses you or somebody mugs you, I guess the new thing is,
[55:11.440 --> 55:14.560]  oh, you were part of it. You know, they robbed your house, you escalated it.
[55:15.280 --> 55:19.200]  You're out of town and somebody robs your house, everything you own, you escalated it.
[55:21.120 --> 55:24.640]  And ladies and gentlemen, the psychology you hate in the cops is not going to help us.
[55:25.360 --> 55:30.160]  The New World Order wants us to hate them. They air this, so we hate them. And so they can
[55:30.160 --> 55:35.280]  legitimize this so that we don't trust them. They don't trust us. Please stop it, police.
[55:36.880 --> 55:40.480]  I mean, all the videos that have come out of Austin and surrounding areas that are on the
[55:40.480 --> 55:45.920]  national news where they'll just have somebody handcuffs beating them just because they want to.
[55:49.360 --> 55:52.720]  And they'll just punch you and punch you and punch you or shoot you in the back and then
[55:52.720 --> 55:57.680]  the media says it's good. Folks, then I've got even worse news.
[55:57.680 --> 56:09.680]  I've got even worse news. Google this. Paul's doing an article for PrismPlanet.com on it right now.
[56:11.200 --> 56:14.480]  I'll get Nemo to post it so you can read it and find it easier. But law enforcement
[56:14.480 --> 56:20.080]  agencies joined together for anti-terrorism initiative. Now just Google that and you'll
[56:20.080 --> 56:26.160]  see it all over the country. But the latest one was a few days ago in Tennessee.
[56:26.160 --> 56:33.120]  Law enforcement agencies joined together for anti-terror initiative. Now we've got terrorism
[56:33.120 --> 56:36.640]  everywhere, right? And so what do they do? They run checkpoints, randomly search people on the
[56:36.640 --> 56:43.680]  streets, randomly search the rivers randomly. I mean, it's ridiculous. I mean, if you want to
[56:43.680 --> 56:51.200]  find gold, go where the gold's at or you want to find liquor, let's say you wanted some whiskey.
[56:51.200 --> 56:55.520]  You drive into town and go to the liquor store. You wouldn't go to a creek bottom and say,
[56:55.520 --> 57:00.560]  I want some liquor. Let me just randomly drive to a creek bottom and go down in a creek bottom.
[57:00.560 --> 57:07.360]  And then have people sweeping the woods for Jack Daniel's bottle. No, you want to find terrorist
[57:07.360 --> 57:12.880]  in the official terror paradigm. Then you've got to go to the Muslim communities and go to the
[57:12.880 --> 57:18.400]  inner city areas and radical mosques are known to preach a certain way. But there's no real terrorism
[57:18.400 --> 57:23.440]  there either. And so see now they say the terrorists are everywhere. There's thousands of secret
[57:23.440 --> 57:29.600]  white al-Qaeda. And so let's just randomly search everyone in Memphis. And then they just randomly
[57:29.600 --> 57:32.000]  are on the street corner searching people. I mean, that is,
[57:34.720 --> 57:41.360]  let's find a 58 Studebaker. And where do we look for a 58 Studebaker? Do we go online and go to
[57:41.360 --> 57:48.560]  the classic car websites? No. No, let's just drop someone with a parachute at 30,000 feet
[57:48.560 --> 57:55.280]  randomly out over Kentucky. And let's have him parachute into a cow pasture and he may find a
[57:55.280 --> 58:01.600]  58 Studebaker. Now, that's if you're officially believing they're really fighting terrorists.
[58:01.600 --> 58:08.400]  When you read this article, though, it says all crime is terrorism. You see, ah, therefore no
[58:08.400 --> 58:14.720]  Fourth Amendment randomly searching everyone without a fourth. It's over, folks. This is
[58:14.720 --> 58:19.200]  this is preparation for martial law. Just like they have military drills in every city, getting
[58:19.200 --> 58:24.640]  you ready for them to take over your city all. And the documents admit it and the PDD admits it
[58:24.640 --> 58:29.040]  and the executive order admits it. And what are they going to do when it happens? Take all your
[58:29.040 --> 58:41.040]  pension funds, take all your stocks and bonds. Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com
[58:41.040 --> 58:52.880]  today. It is a big idea. A new world order in the near future. Earth is dominated by a powerful
[58:52.880 --> 58:59.120]  world government. It's known as the builder bird. Could their objective be world domination?
[58:59.680 --> 59:05.760]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the new world order,
[59:05.760 --> 59:14.960]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand. For the first time in history,
[59:14.960 --> 59:20.480]  the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open. You will learn the secret that drives the
[59:20.480 --> 59:25.120]  entire new world order agenda. Build America is making great progress for the world government.
[59:25.120 --> 59:28.320]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need.

[1:00:12.480 --> 1:00:18.720]  They are simulating in public schools nationwide, taking sixth and seventh graders
[1:00:18.720 --> 1:00:25.680]  to FEMA camps, mainstream news. They simulate, quote, militia gun owners and home schoolers
[1:00:25.680 --> 1:00:32.400]  murdering the children and killing them nationwide, traumatizing them in psych warfare to go to camps,
[1:00:32.400 --> 1:00:37.280]  to report on their parents and that gun owners are bad. Hard core psych warfare run by the
[1:00:37.280 --> 1:00:45.280]  behavioral psychologist. On top of that, all over the nation, they are federalizing police.
[1:00:45.280 --> 1:00:52.960]  They are doing urban warfare drills, Marines, Army, many cases, foreign troops are with them.
[1:00:52.960 --> 1:00:58.640]  Repeat, foreign troops are with them in many cases. We have video of this mainstream news articles.
[1:01:00.480 --> 1:01:05.120]  And then this law enforcement agencies joined together for anti-terrorism initiative,
[1:01:05.120 --> 1:01:10.800]  commercial appeal, Memphis, Tennessee. Now you type that headline in and click web,
[1:01:10.800 --> 1:01:15.200]  you will get hundreds of articles around the country. Just like Homeland Security announced
[1:01:15.200 --> 1:01:22.720]  two days ago, anyone detained, anyone stopped by, quote, federal officers will have their DNA taken.
[1:01:23.920 --> 1:01:29.680]  They took DNA at checkpoints and randomly stopped people on the street, pedestrians,
[1:01:29.680 --> 1:01:36.320]  hundreds of officers from 50 agencies violated their fourth amendment saying it was anti-terror,
[1:01:37.600 --> 1:01:44.000]  setting the precedent. Now remember, this is like what I said earlier, if you wanted a bottle of
[1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:52.560]  Jack Daniels or Jim Bean or Grey Goose vodka, would you go to a liquor store or would you
[1:01:53.200 --> 1:01:58.160]  have someone take you up on a plane, put a blindfold on you, fly in a random direction
[1:01:58.160 --> 1:02:03.680]  1,000 miles and then have you jump out and parachute to the ground to look for Grey Goose vodka?
[1:02:05.840 --> 1:02:12.480]  No, you would, if you were looking for a Walmart, would you go to a Walmart or would you have someone
[1:02:12.480 --> 1:02:18.560]  put you in a plane and randomly throw you out somewhere? But it's even more rare than that,
[1:02:18.560 --> 1:02:26.720]  it would be like looking for a 57 Chevy with a candy, fire engine red, glossy original paint job
[1:02:26.720 --> 1:02:36.880]  with creamy white fenders and red leather seats. Would you be taking a bus randomly driven to the
[1:02:36.880 --> 1:02:42.880]  middle of nowhere and then dumped out? Is that how you'd find the 57 Chevy? This is if you believe
[1:02:42.880 --> 1:02:48.400]  terrorism is real and not totally manufactured in this country. There is some real terrorism
[1:02:48.400 --> 1:02:52.480]  internationally, but generally that's even provocative, it's very rare. It's like finding a
[1:02:52.480 --> 1:02:58.240]  leprechaun or a unicorn and I don't really believe those exist, that's the whole point, it's mythical.
[1:02:58.240 --> 1:03:02.480]  This is a new myth, a new myth though, it's a new religion given to you by the behavioral
[1:03:02.480 --> 1:03:07.680]  psychologist. So they have hundreds and hundreds of police randomly searching everyone, it's actually
[1:03:07.680 --> 1:03:13.920]  thousands of police from 50 agencies, running around randomly in major cities in small towns
[1:03:13.920 --> 1:03:19.040]  searching people randomly. Just like they do in New York, they just randomly tell you line up,
[1:03:19.040 --> 1:03:25.920]  they search you now. They had 500,000 stops in 2006, those numbers came out in 2007, well soon
[1:03:25.920 --> 1:03:36.320]  at the 2007 numbers in 2008, 500 plus was 521,000 that came out a few months ago, 521,000 stops
[1:03:36.320 --> 1:03:41.520]  in 2006 up from 300 and something that year before, random ones, just you'll be there in New York,
[1:03:41.520 --> 1:03:46.480]  and they'll just block a street off and search everyone randomly, now going nationwide under
[1:03:46.480 --> 1:03:54.080]  Homeland Security Control. Law enforcement agencies joined together for full anti-terrorism
[1:03:54.080 --> 1:03:58.240]  initiative, Shelby County Sheriff's Deputies arrested, see this is an article telling you
[1:03:58.240 --> 1:04:04.000]  how great it is, the Knoxville paper said that it was ridiculous and that they could have gone,
[1:04:04.800 --> 1:04:08.240]  they actually said they could have gone to one street where heroin is known to be sold and
[1:04:08.240 --> 1:04:13.200]  busted people. There was actually an article against this when you Google it, but this one's pro,
[1:04:13.200 --> 1:04:18.240]  Shelby County Sheriff's Deputies arrested 71 people including 31 fugitives during a 24-hour
[1:04:18.240 --> 1:04:23.840]  street sweep, a street sweep that they had in Germany that ended about half an hour after
[1:04:23.840 --> 1:04:29.280]  sunrise Sunday. The Sheriff's Office in 50 federal state and local law enforcement agencies
[1:04:29.280 --> 1:04:35.360]  pulled over cars, climbed on boats and served fugitive warrants as part of an anti-terrorism
[1:04:35.360 --> 1:04:42.000]  initiative called Operation Sudden Impact, anti-terror checkpoints, fugitive and then it
[1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:49.040]  goes on. They were scanning license plates everything, it was a martial law drill and local
[1:04:49.040 --> 1:04:54.880]  police admitted it. Terror Storm, a history of government sponsored terror, loose change,
[1:04:54.880 --> 1:04:59.920]  final cut, in-game blueprint for global enslavement, the true story of the Bilderberg group, the
[1:04:59.920 --> 1:05:05.120]  late great USA, America, freedom to fascism. These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful

[1:08:09.200 --> 1:08:21.520]  Section 802 of HR 3162 the USA Patriot Act the Congress passed while four of its six office
[1:08:21.520 --> 1:08:27.280]  buildings were shut down under anthrax government biological weapon attack that I predicted here
[1:08:27.280 --> 1:08:33.360]  on air. The most weaponized form ever known from Fort Detrick Maryland and now the mainstream news
[1:08:33.360 --> 1:08:38.400]  reports that they believe the US government a branch of it launched the attack enemies of
[1:08:38.400 --> 1:08:42.240]  the Bush administration where of course the ones that were mailed the anthrax.
[1:08:47.760 --> 1:08:54.480]  Now all of that is going on and it says in section 802 that all misdemeanors are acts of
[1:08:54.480 --> 1:09:00.800]  terrorism and so that there's no bill of rights or due process for anyone and then you've got
[1:09:00.800 --> 1:09:06.960]  headlines out of AP within a year of it being passed saying local prosecutors use Patriot Act
[1:09:06.960 --> 1:09:12.560]  thousands of times and that would be per state and they just announced everything is now terrorism.
[1:09:12.560 --> 1:09:17.120]  See first they get you trained as terrorism then they say everything is terrorism and
[1:09:19.120 --> 1:09:24.240]  I mean how ridiculous is it that oh we're going to have random sweeps and random cities looking
[1:09:24.240 --> 1:09:29.920]  for terrorists and one of the manuals say people that make frequent references the US Constitution
[1:09:29.920 --> 1:09:36.160]  those that talk about Jesus Christ those that have firearms law enforcement agencies joined
[1:09:36.160 --> 1:09:42.080]  together for anti-terrorism initiative in Memphis Tennessee and surrounding areas Shelby County
[1:09:42.080 --> 1:09:48.320]  Sheriff's deputies arrested 71 people during 31 fugitives that's because they went to fugitives
[1:09:48.320 --> 1:09:52.960]  where it was for warrants when you go look most of its traffic offenses they knew where they were
[1:09:52.960 --> 1:09:59.040]  they just did it to make it part of the terrorism they arrested 31 terrorist so that's the psychology
[1:09:59.040 --> 1:10:03.440]  that's the psychology Shelby County Sheriff's deputies arrested 71 people including 31 fugitives
[1:10:03.440 --> 1:10:10.000]  during a 24-hour street sweep that ended about half an hour after sunrise Sunday
[1:10:10.800 --> 1:10:15.760]  the sheriff's office and 50 federal state and local law enforcement agencies under federal
[1:10:15.760 --> 1:10:21.440]  control pulled over cars climbed on boats in the river served fugitive warrants as part of an
[1:10:21.440 --> 1:10:26.080]  anti-terrorism initiative called Operation Sudden Impact and we have local newscasts where it shows
[1:10:26.080 --> 1:10:32.160]  them running checkpoints on the streets and just randomly arresting people and it has a photo
[1:10:32.160 --> 1:10:36.880]  special agent Don Wolf of the West Tennessee judicial violent crime task force see that violent
[1:10:36.880 --> 1:10:44.240]  crime task force fights terror and drug task force with his dog Hydro conducts a search of a tugboat
[1:10:44.240 --> 1:10:49.280]  with petty officer second-class rich Guthrie of the US Coast Guard so you got the police working
[1:10:49.280 --> 1:10:55.120]  with the military it's now under military control during Operation Sudden Impact that's right using
[1:10:55.120 --> 1:10:59.360]  the military against the American people it's what it's all about like any good third world
[1:10:59.360 --> 1:11:05.040]  banana boat country Richard Pillsbury works in the sheriff's office of Homeland Security Command
[1:11:05.040 --> 1:11:09.520]  Center those are the federalization centers where they scan your plates track your cellphones in
[1:11:09.520 --> 1:11:14.720]  real time destroy America I would call it the freedom destruction center the federalization
[1:11:15.280 --> 1:11:21.120]  the regional governors will keep the local systems in line that's what it is Richard Pillsbury
[1:11:22.320 --> 1:11:26.880]  works for the sheriff's office of Homeland Security Command Center the office coordinated a
[1:11:26.880 --> 1:11:33.120]  regional crime suppression initiative over the weekend oh as part of the terror fighting initiative
[1:11:33.120 --> 1:11:37.680]  see how they're interchanging that now coordinated a regional crime suppression initiative over the
[1:11:37.680 --> 1:11:43.200]  weekend that involved officers from more than 50 federal states and local agencies see they got to
[1:11:43.200 --> 1:11:46.880]  fight the commie system where they funded the communists they've got to fight the drugs where
[1:11:46.880 --> 1:11:56.160]  they ship them in now let's fight the terrorists which is all crime and it goes on and on with photos
[1:11:56.160 --> 1:12:02.000]  and the things it was the first time that many agencies joined forces for such a large sweep
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:07.600]  said Shelby County Sheriff Mark Luttrel whose office is coordinated the operation even though
[1:12:07.600 --> 1:12:12.640]  Memphis hasn't suffered a terrorist attack the city is using federal grants to fight crime
[1:12:13.680 --> 1:12:19.200]  federalizing the and see the SWAT teams it's all designed for mass arrest they've trained the police
[1:12:19.200 --> 1:12:23.840]  nationwide on how to drive the buses for mass arrest they have regional relocation centers at
[1:12:23.840 --> 1:12:30.400]  every airport here in Austin at both airports the old one in the new one you see this is all about

[1:24:48.640 --> 1:24:55.280]  now in arkansas they have cut people's heads off and arms off and poured gasoline on them and
[1:24:55.280 --> 1:25:04.000]  said it was suicide this is your government now i don't know if uh the jewish defense league or
[1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:10.240]  some other group those are suspects uh fbi are suspects i mean if they'll kill cop of the year
[1:25:10.240 --> 1:25:14.320]  terrence yakey they'll kill anybody and believe me i don't like talking about these are hardcore
[1:25:14.320 --> 1:25:20.240]  killers folks they'll kill you in a second certain divisions of the fbi key cadres of anti-terror
[1:25:20.880 --> 1:25:24.800]  most of them have been recruited out of special forces that the types that were involved wiring
[1:25:24.800 --> 1:25:30.000]  up the uh world trade centers and i mean i i take no pleasure having to speak out against these guys
[1:25:31.600 --> 1:25:37.520]  they like to kill people that probably kill me one day but the killing has to stop sometimes
[1:25:38.160 --> 1:25:43.200]  you know the raping of the country the destruction of our liberties somebody's got to fight them and
[1:25:43.200 --> 1:25:48.720]  i can't believe that they've murdered this guy and this is their perfect m o because it's it's an
[1:25:48.720 --> 1:25:56.880]  arrogant it's a signal for everybody that has a brain it's hey we're killers back off and uh
[1:25:56.880 --> 1:26:04.240]  for everybody else it's just further conditioning i just hope if they kill me just just don't believe

[1:26:18.640 --> 1:26:23.040]  for decades before they kill them and it's a big topic of discussion of why i'm still alive it's
[1:26:23.040 --> 1:26:27.120]  because i'm so vocal and i'm not even saying everybody in the fbi is bad ever every cop's
[1:26:27.120 --> 1:26:35.680]  bad but the system is bad and uh you want to go ahead do we have time to play this clip

[1:34:06.320 --> 1:34:15.520]  clear about something the imf and the world bank in the 2002 documents that got released
[1:34:15.520 --> 1:34:21.600]  when joseph sticklets went public chief economist world bank talked about how they engineer food
[1:34:21.600 --> 1:34:26.640]  calamity how they want to buy up all the food how they want to jack up the prices under state
[1:34:26.640 --> 1:34:31.440]  department memorandum 200 and the royal commission on population put up by the british crown
[1:34:32.160 --> 1:34:39.760]  decades earlier to reduce third world population and stimulate war between the sides and economic
[1:34:40.720 --> 1:34:44.080]  destabilization this is all public this is the nice people that run things
[1:34:44.080 --> 1:34:49.840]  now they're all posing like oh they're going to deal with the crisis they need world taxes
[1:34:49.840 --> 1:34:55.680]  not just for greenhouse gas not just for carbon dioxide but to feed the third world who they love
[1:34:55.680 --> 1:35:02.160]  so much after they've done everything to create worldwide food shortages and riots in scores of
[1:35:02.160 --> 1:35:08.320]  countries now do i think we're not going to have food on the shelves here well certain things won't
[1:35:08.320 --> 1:35:13.200]  be there certain things will cost twice what they did but there'll still be other foods the point is
[1:35:13.200 --> 1:35:18.800]  is that food prices are exploding they're talking about depression in a bunch of newspapers today
[1:35:18.800 --> 1:35:24.320]  i don't know what's going to happen and i'm not saying this is all going to be the end of everything
[1:35:24.320 --> 1:35:29.200]  but there's a good chance we're going into very very serious times and that's why i believe
[1:35:29.200 --> 1:35:35.440]  in the insurance policy of storeable foods and joining us is steve shank who not only is an expert
[1:35:35.440 --> 1:35:43.200]  on this for close to three decades 27 years not just that uh he also is is the longest largest
[1:35:43.200 --> 1:35:48.960]  continually operating storeable food company so he deals with what's and he told us six months before
[1:35:48.960 --> 1:35:53.760]  there was already shortages of wheat and corn and things and then it was much worse the media said
[1:35:53.760 --> 1:35:58.080]  and then all that came out so he's also a very good source and that's why we've got him here
[1:35:58.720 --> 1:36:05.040]  steve shank thanks for coming on with us i'm glad to be aboard like so we have
[1:36:05.040 --> 1:36:13.040]  had um i'm i'm glad you're so positive that uh you think that there's going to be food on the
[1:36:13.040 --> 1:36:23.760]  shelves and i i guess there will be but uh we have had four days of virtual well there will come a
[1:36:23.760 --> 1:36:32.000]  time in the not very distant future when we will refer to uh the the past week the first four days
[1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:44.000]  of this past week as the four days in april because at at one time on monday we had the united
[1:36:44.000 --> 1:36:52.960]  nations world food program announced the fact that officially there was a worldwide food famine
[1:36:52.960 --> 1:37:01.680]  emergency on that same day they announced that they were requesting one billion dollars from
[1:37:01.680 --> 1:37:09.840]  developed nations to buy food for underdeveloped nations the question that i had to ask now
[1:37:10.720 --> 1:37:18.720]  if folks want to get up on uh the uh e-foods direct dot com website uh there's an editorial
[1:37:18.720 --> 1:37:25.360]  that i wrote i sent it out to uh to all of our people on the email program that we have
[1:37:25.360 --> 1:37:32.480]  and i sent you a copy of it and the first i've got it we have to go ahead no i was saying i've got it
[1:37:33.200 --> 1:37:40.480]  yeah the first question that we had to ask folks is very simple and the same day the united nations
[1:37:40.480 --> 1:37:46.880]  came out and said there is a world food crisis that same day we got noticed that the major
[1:37:47.680 --> 1:37:53.840]  major rice producing countries in the world had all shut off any exports to keep all their food
[1:37:53.840 --> 1:37:59.680]  in their own borders for their own people because they were already starving and that same day
[1:38:00.240 --> 1:38:09.520]  they asked us as one of the developed nations to send uh to plan to send 500 million half a billion
[1:38:09.520 --> 1:38:17.120]  dollars by may 1st to this front to feed the starving nations the question you have to ask
[1:38:17.120 --> 1:38:23.280]  yourself is if they did that in the same day where do they plan to get the food they just said
[1:38:23.280 --> 1:38:30.000]  there's a worldwide food shortage every nation in the world virtually is shutting down its borders
[1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:36.720]  in terms of exporting food there's one nation that won't alex and that's the united states
[1:38:37.440 --> 1:38:42.960]  and the reason the united states won't shut down exports and keep the food for its own people
[1:38:43.520 --> 1:38:49.600]  is because all of the food here is controlled by the major agri-corps which are international
[1:38:49.600 --> 1:38:57.360]  and now we have another situation folks you need to follow this logic very closely it
[1:38:57.360 --> 1:39:06.720]  doesn't make sense but it is logic the second day on tuesday cnn reported if any of you opened up
[1:39:06.720 --> 1:39:17.360]  your your computers and uh looked at the at the news mr bush immediately sent on the second day
[1:39:17.360 --> 1:39:25.680]  on monday they asked for the money on the second day mr bush sent 200 million dollars
[1:39:26.880 --> 1:39:36.400]  to the united nations fund this from a country that already is importing 30 of its food every
[1:39:36.400 --> 1:39:44.960]  single day that has had the major companies from whom we are importing food shut down their
[1:39:44.960 --> 1:39:52.320]  exports to keep their own food for themselves and we're sending money we're sending money to buy
[1:39:52.320 --> 1:39:58.720]  food that doesn't exist well steve let me let me try to boil it down there's already there's already
[1:39:58.720 --> 1:40:04.800]  a massive raw material of food material shortage you go in pizza places and they got ads saying
[1:40:04.800 --> 1:40:10.640]  massive price increase i mean they're explaining why that's happening so now as as the crisis
[1:40:10.640 --> 1:40:16.800]  develops worldwide nations are begging for food that means it will accelerate food shortages that
[1:40:16.800 --> 1:40:22.400]  we're already apparent here yes now here's the here's the main thing the point i was making
[1:40:22.400 --> 1:40:28.160]  alex with the fact that uh we're the only ones that are not going to close down exports is the
[1:40:28.160 --> 1:40:36.000]  fact that that 200 million 200 million dollars that has just been sent out of our country is going
[1:40:36.000 --> 1:40:45.280]  to buy food and what's going to buy food is from the united states so in other words what you have
[1:40:45.280 --> 1:40:51.440]  just had folks is you've had your money sent to the world fund which is going to buy food from
[1:40:51.440 --> 1:40:57.040]  the only place that it can buy it and that means that your food is going to be shorter now in the
[1:40:57.040 --> 1:41:03.280]  same week we got noticed that corn is going to be is going to be rationed that's all of the feed for
[1:41:03.280 --> 1:41:09.760]  the cattle to provide your dairy products and your meat and a tremendous amount of anything that's
[1:41:09.760 --> 1:41:15.280]  supplied by the farmers and oil prices are oil prices are way up truckers are going out of business
[1:41:15.280 --> 1:41:20.000]  everywhere prices are skyrocketing and the federal reserve says there's basically no inflation
[1:41:20.960 --> 1:41:25.360]  that's right and here's the here's the here's another point when you get back to the food issue
[1:41:25.360 --> 1:41:33.680]  you and i have talked before and there's only one means by which a family can become independent
[1:41:33.680 --> 1:41:40.640]  of the controls that this famine will create there will be bread lines but one thing that i concluded
[1:41:40.640 --> 1:41:45.600]  just this last week alex is something that i have never imagined before you know i've been
[1:41:45.600 --> 1:41:50.400]  screaming up and down that that that folks have to get in food otherwise they'll be standing in
[1:41:50.400 --> 1:41:54.560]  a bread line and have to bear their butts for the bird blue shot have to give their kids away
[1:41:54.560 --> 1:42:00.960]  have to give up their guns all that kind of stuff remember katrina we had bread lines there but there
[1:42:00.960 --> 1:42:08.000]  was no bread in fact the military stacked up the food for days and wouldn't give it to them and it
[1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:12.560]  turned out it was a laboratory test i mean the grunts didn't know it the cops didn't know it
[1:42:12.560 --> 1:42:17.600]  to test and see what we do and they they kept the food away and they did gun confiscation
[1:42:17.600 --> 1:42:24.080]  as they were ordered so it was an a plus for tyranny well and the thing is that what we will
[1:42:24.080 --> 1:42:31.840]  have here there is no food okay that's why the un declared the problem but people don't realize is
[1:42:31.840 --> 1:42:36.240]  that two hundred million dollars and the rest of the money that the the developed nations will give
[1:42:36.880 --> 1:42:42.800]  will buy food but it'll buy our food so if you think that the rationing of corn the rationing
[1:42:42.800 --> 1:42:49.200]  of flour right now and and here's the thing it used to be when people had asked me uh what to do
[1:42:49.200 --> 1:42:54.080]  if they just didn't have enough money to put together a supply with the fruits and vegetables
[1:42:54.080 --> 1:43:00.000]  and dairy products and stuff like you have in here for your supply uh alex we'd say okay at
[1:43:00.000 --> 1:43:05.200]  least start with something get some of the basics like wheat honeymilk salt beans and rice uh it's
[1:43:05.200 --> 1:43:10.480]  not going to be tasty but you can live on it what are the first things that are are going short
[1:43:10.480 --> 1:43:17.040]  and disappearing wheat is being rationed the inexpensive the inexpensive staples have more
[1:43:17.040 --> 1:43:23.360]  than doubled and right now we have families in our country that can't afford to eat well let me
[1:43:23.360 --> 1:43:28.080]  stop you i mean it's not just bread lines that have started for shortages because that hasn't
[1:43:28.080 --> 1:43:34.000]  quite hit yet the price increase has it's bread lines intense cities because uh i mean everybody
[1:43:34.000 --> 1:43:39.440]  i know i mean i know like half the people i know and i don't want to get personal here more than half
[1:43:40.080 --> 1:43:46.160]  their their their girlfriends mothers uh their boyfriends their parents are losing their houses i
[1:43:46.160 --> 1:43:53.440]  mean all over the country uh thousands of retail change uh hundreds of medium size and big ones
[1:43:53.440 --> 1:43:58.800]  going out i mean i'm not trying to steve i hope you're wrong about all this but no doubt food
[1:43:58.800 --> 1:44:03.680]  prices are going to explode no doubt that within the next two years we're going to see probably
[1:44:03.680 --> 1:44:07.920]  an inflationary depression i hope that's not the case but the the writing just gets worse and worse
[1:44:07.920 --> 1:44:11.760]  and all the experts say it will happen i'm just trying to say i hope it doesn't you know there's
[1:44:11.760 --> 1:44:16.800]  a hope and a prayer and uh i know that with the crises i know the old things that are happening
[1:44:16.800 --> 1:44:22.400]  and the talk of war and i ran terrorism that it's good to have horrible food i've been doing this
[1:44:22.400 --> 1:44:27.920]  for 10 years uh you know it's the real insurance policy i i i just you know i mean i mean you
[1:44:27.920 --> 1:44:32.240]  say no food i mean how much what's going to be short what are we not going to have what's the
[1:44:32.240 --> 1:44:40.720]  time frame okay here's the deal uh first of all i need to make an announcement uh j michael stevens
[1:44:40.720 --> 1:44:50.960]  groupie foods direct will have a price increase on march 12th okay we it will not just be a price
[1:44:50.960 --> 1:44:57.840]  increase you mean you mean april uh or or the next month uh this is april it's going to be march
[1:44:57.840 --> 1:45:04.480]  12th we're announcing it today the 18th of april so that people can gear up and and get whatever
[1:45:04.480 --> 1:45:12.160]  order they need to we have enough of material in the in the inventories to handle at the present
[1:45:12.160 --> 1:45:20.160]  buy what what the prices are right now we know that by march 12th the prices will change and
[1:45:20.160 --> 1:45:26.000]  we will have to pass them along but here's the other thing that's more serious there will be
[1:45:26.000 --> 1:45:34.000]  adjustments in availability right now for example to try and and get apples dried apples to put
[1:45:34.000 --> 1:45:38.720]  steve steve steve steve let me stop you i i mean i want to be clear i talked to you all fair and
[1:45:38.720 --> 1:45:42.800]  i know you're getting tons of calls it's crazy busy at the factory and everything else but i
[1:45:42.800 --> 1:45:46.640]  want to be clear because i get things backwards some too do you mean next march because we just
[1:45:46.640 --> 1:45:53.520]  had march and now it's april or are you sorry did i say i did i say march i meant may okay
[1:45:53.520 --> 1:46:00.480]  this is april next month may 12th is when the price increase is going to go but also at that time
[1:46:00.480 --> 1:46:09.280]  there will be a severe adjustment of availability okay things with wheat with flour in them
[1:46:10.240 --> 1:46:17.920]  are really up for grabs but we have a rice situation right now 67 percent of the rice in
[1:46:17.920 --> 1:46:24.080]  the in the world is short in other words anybody that depends on rice in their supplies one of
[1:46:24.080 --> 1:46:28.960]  the things we're going to start putting up on our website that's all of asia much of africa
[1:46:28.960 --> 1:46:34.000]  i mean this is unbelievable and i've got the news reports right here but but but what are you
[1:46:34.000 --> 1:46:40.240]  hearing behind the scenes from from the suppliers what i'm hearing from the suppliers is they're
[1:46:40.240 --> 1:46:48.320]  calling us asking if we can sell them some rice suppliers are calling us asking if we have three
[1:46:48.320 --> 1:46:54.160]  major grain suppliers in the west now to be clear what was it november when you went crazy and made
[1:46:54.160 --> 1:47:01.360]  a huge food buy uh how long till that runs out uh it's already run out but we went crazy and
[1:47:01.360 --> 1:47:06.800]  contacted a whole bunch of small suppliers right now we picked up two loads of wheat
[1:47:06.800 --> 1:47:11.840]  just to give you an idea and i apologize for taking the length of time on this one but
[1:47:11.840 --> 1:47:17.280]  it it should tell people a message we picked up two loads of wheat two truckloads of 55
[1:47:17.280 --> 1:47:25.760]  thousand pound loads of of wheat because some of the suppliers that uh that actually supply seed
[1:47:26.800 --> 1:47:32.880]  as opposed to the grain suppliers had overbought the seeding season is done and they haven't
[1:47:32.880 --> 1:47:39.840]  realized yet how dear wheat is and we were able to pick up a couple of loads so that the people
[1:47:39.840 --> 1:47:44.400]  that are ordering their supplies can get the stuff that that is involved with wheat but
[1:47:44.400 --> 1:47:49.520]  that's the type of thing that's happening uh we have three major suppliers out here in the west
[1:47:50.080 --> 1:47:56.400]  every one of them has contacted the the jms warehouse asking if they can buy wheat back
[1:47:56.400 --> 1:48:00.000]  because they can't meet their contract yeah folks if you're doubting any of this just type
[1:48:00.000 --> 1:48:05.920]  into google food shortage you'll get thousands of articles and prices doubling and just insane
[1:48:05.920 --> 1:48:12.720]  things uh that are happening uh so so when you say running out of food what type of foods are
[1:48:12.720 --> 1:48:18.160]  and when will we see this happen okay when they start uh when they when they do more to
[1:48:18.160 --> 1:48:26.080]  limit the amount of corn going to uh uh to uh farmers to feed their cattle uh you're going
[1:48:26.080 --> 1:48:32.400]  to start seeing dairy we had a price jump uh that was huge of dairy where we start where we almost
[1:48:32.400 --> 1:48:37.680]  uh took the milk out of the uh one-year supply no i know milk at the store nobody's noticing
[1:48:37.680 --> 1:48:41.760]  it used to be two and a half dollars now it's like four and a half and at gas stations
[1:48:41.760 --> 1:48:48.880]  it's six and a half dollars no no i've i've paid seven and a half at a gas station yeah but but
[1:48:48.880 --> 1:48:55.200]  this is not even the beginning yet okay this is just working up to it bottom line is we're
[1:48:55.200 --> 1:49:01.760]  going to start what we're going to start doing folks what you need to do is you need to con you

[1:54:36.880 --> 1:54:41.680]  he's saying it's it's pretty much dead reckoning that it's going to happen like he's saying or it

[2:08:21.440 --> 2:08:26.400]  september the 11th for them was a bad day for us it was a change of attitude the military
[2:08:26.400 --> 2:08:31.840]  commissions act of 2006 is one of the most important pieces of legislation in the war on
[2:08:31.840 --> 2:08:39.120]  terror habeas corpus it is the last line of defense against arbitrary executive power
[2:08:39.120 --> 2:08:45.040]  the frame was created a system where we did not have to rely on the good graces or good mood of
[2:08:45.040 --> 2:08:49.920]  the president military commissions act they would perpetuate the indefinite detention of hundreds
[2:08:49.920 --> 2:08:57.520]  of individuals against whom the government has brought no charges and present no evidence without
[2:08:57.520 --> 2:09:02.960]  any recourse to justice whatsoever it does violence to the constitution what the congress
[2:09:02.960 --> 2:09:09.520]  did with the president signed today essentially revokes over 200 years of american principles
[2:09:09.520 --> 2:09:14.720]  and values does this mean that under this law ultimately the only thing keeping you i or the
[2:09:14.720 --> 2:09:20.080]  viewer out of gitmo is the sanity and honesty of the president of the united states it does
[2:09:20.080 --> 2:09:26.000]  the congress just gave the president despotic powers and you could hear the yawn across the
[2:09:26.000 --> 2:09:31.520]  country as people turn to you know dancing with the stars i mean it it's it's otherworldly the
[2:09:31.520 --> 2:09:37.120]  bill i signed today helps secure this country this can go on indefinitely and it's a self-proclaimed
[2:09:37.120 --> 2:09:41.360]  emergency the self-proclaimed emergency the point here is you've heard repeatedly from
[2:09:41.360 --> 2:09:50.400]  administration officials that we cannot predict how long it will go on october 17 2006 president
[2:09:50.400 --> 2:09:56.960]  bush signed into law the military commissions act of 2006 by doing so our representatives in
[2:09:56.960 --> 2:10:01.840]  washington have committed the most shocking and openly malevolent act of giving the president of
[2:10:01.840 --> 2:10:07.440]  the united states true dictatorial ruling powers and by stripping americans of their constitutionally
[2:10:07.440 --> 2:10:14.160]  guaranteed right of habeas corpus all that is necessary for someone to go to prison without
[2:10:14.160 --> 2:10:19.520]  any recourse to justice whatsoever is for the president of the united states to declare that
[2:10:19.520 --> 2:10:25.840]  person an enemy combatant the president can label that person as either a legal enemy combatant
[2:10:25.840 --> 2:10:32.480]  or an illegal enemy combatant assigning titles to americans that presuppose their guilt and by
[2:10:32.480 --> 2:10:41.360]  default deny those people their basic right to habeas corpus all right and i would add it's always
[2:10:41.360 --> 2:10:47.440]  worse than we can even uh you know say in films that it's the president or any of his designates
[2:10:47.440 --> 2:10:52.880]  and i read the headline earlier law enforcement agencies joined together for anti-terrorism initiative
[2:10:52.880 --> 2:10:58.800]  nationwide sunday but this is a story out of memphis 50 federal state and local law enforcement
[2:10:58.800 --> 2:11:04.240]  agencies pulled over cars random checkpoints on streets uh looking for drugs looking for people
[2:11:04.240 --> 2:11:11.200]  with warrants giving tickets it said an anti-terror initiative see at all crime is terror under section
[2:11:11.200 --> 2:11:17.120]  802 and it said that the fema command center office of homeland security command center ran it all
[2:11:17.120 --> 2:11:22.320]  they have ca liaisons in them they track your cell phones in real time and then i talked to some locals
[2:11:22.320 --> 2:11:29.840]  in memphis and they said yeah this is marshal law takeover drills folks it isn't our opinion in
[2:11:31.120 --> 2:11:37.840]  the military commissions act in the john warner defense authorization act in pdd 51 it states the
[2:11:37.840 --> 2:11:42.800]  president not congress no one else is supreme dictator it says the governors are nothing it
[2:11:42.800 --> 2:11:48.320]  says the government is prepared for war with the american people it says for insurrection and rebellion
[2:11:48.320 --> 2:11:55.040]  this they're set up to attack us in mass this isn't meant for guys with turbines and beards
[2:11:55.040 --> 2:12:01.600]  even if you believe in terror this is a widespread attack set up for the mass of everyone and now
[2:12:01.600 --> 2:12:06.240]  they admit departments are being trained for marshal law i've got news clip after news clip
[2:12:06.240 --> 2:12:14.240]  gun confiscations 26 000 preachers trained to do this tasering an nfl football player who politely
[2:12:14.240 --> 2:12:19.040]  put his hands together and begged the officer not to push him anymore cop just pushing him pushing
[2:12:19.040 --> 2:12:25.040]  him it's on prison planet and the guy just says please and he shoves him so he tasers him i mean
[2:12:25.040 --> 2:12:31.040]  and the media says it's good and he's bad that the person being shoved and then tays for no reason
[2:12:31.040 --> 2:12:36.880]  is bad and deserves it folks that's because the country's gone the bankers are now just like a
[2:12:36.880 --> 2:12:43.360]  spider catches you in the web say you're a moth it comes in injects you with venom that liquefies

[2:15:11.120 --> 2:15:16.080]  washington you're fired info wars dot com i remember william louis when he made a police
[2:15:16.080 --> 2:15:22.960]  state audio thing i guess back in 99 98 he wanted to work with me come to work here and i just was
[2:15:22.960 --> 2:15:28.480]  by myself with one little office with two employees and said man i can't pay you then he went to work
[2:15:28.480 --> 2:15:33.040]  for uh rick wiles did a good job there then he went to work for davin joist now he's on his own
[2:15:33.040 --> 2:15:37.280]  he's made his film on his own i wish i would have hired him way back then because he's such a great
[2:15:37.280 --> 2:15:42.960]  filmmaker but it doesn't matter he's getting the films out and that's what matters and we just
[2:15:42.960 --> 2:15:47.760]  commend william louis for all the fine work he's done william it is good to have you on board with
[2:15:47.760 --> 2:15:54.000]  us sir well alex it is a honor to be on the program with you i waited a long time to do this
[2:15:54.000 --> 2:15:59.200]  been listening to you for 10 years now and i've got to tell you you know you are you are the
[2:15:59.200 --> 2:16:03.840]  inspiration for me getting into this business uh i knew i wanted to make films i just didn't know
[2:16:03.840 --> 2:16:07.360]  what i wanted to make them about and i remember the first thing he made was an audio cd with
[2:16:07.360 --> 2:16:12.960]  tracks of me ranting it's excellent well you know that those were back in the days when i still
[2:16:12.960 --> 2:16:18.800]  believed that uh i could get music out on the internet fairly easy uh it's just not as easy as
[2:16:18.800 --> 2:16:23.920]  you think video is the way to go man people people will sit down and watch no no we need to promote
[2:16:23.920 --> 2:16:29.600]  a fictional book that's that'll save us um i mean sarcastic yeah film film is the way to go the best
[2:16:29.600 --> 2:16:35.120]  weapon in the arsenal tell us about this movie several years in the making i mean the slick cover
[2:16:35.120 --> 2:16:42.000]  slick production great interviews i mean this thing is a real crim dolla cram cream of the cream
[2:16:42.000 --> 2:16:47.920]  that you've done william well i appreciate that but you know this is this is a very low budget
[2:16:47.920 --> 2:16:53.360]  production and uh i think people are going to be absolutely astounded at what they see in this
[2:16:54.000 --> 2:16:59.040]  uh we took a lot of uh a lot of time to do you know the graphics and the animation and
[2:16:59.680 --> 2:17:03.280]  everything that you see on the screen that kind of tries to tie all this together
[2:17:03.280 --> 2:17:07.840]  because i believe that you know the visuals is just as important and look at the music and what
[2:17:07.840 --> 2:17:13.840]  you're saying so um yeah about two years in the works research for this thing much more than that
[2:17:13.840 --> 2:17:17.920]  but i've got to say you know we're going to research in this now for about at least seven or eight
[2:17:17.920 --> 2:17:26.960]  years um this is a culmination of all of the bad legislation that's been uh you know passed by
[2:17:26.960 --> 2:17:33.280]  435 members of your representatives that are supposed to represent the united states of america
[2:17:33.280 --> 2:17:40.480]  and the people and they obviously simply don't this is our this is our attempt to tie all that
[2:17:40.480 --> 2:17:46.480]  together and show people exactly what's going on you know as as they say connect the dots so do we
[2:17:46.480 --> 2:17:50.960]  we're going to connect the dots in this documentary and show people exactly what rights you've lost
[2:17:50.960 --> 2:17:59.200]  bill by bill as they accumulate well i'm just so honored that i uh you know woke you up or uh
[2:17:59.200 --> 2:18:05.040]  you know was the one that uh to use the enemy's analogy bitchy and i you know and i've given so
[2:18:05.040 --> 2:18:10.960]  many the the liberty bug thanks to god's guidance and i just now you've given so many the uh you
[2:18:10.960 --> 2:18:15.920]  know the spirit of liberty and freedom as we transfer this to others i think the globalists
[2:18:15.920 --> 2:18:20.000]  are going wild right now because they are scared to know we're coming for them and i think that
[2:18:20.000 --> 2:18:25.440]  just accelerates people's awakening i mean it's getting nuts now where the cops for no reason
[2:18:25.440 --> 2:18:30.960]  push a black guy who's putting his hands together praying to them and then they tazer him in the
[2:18:30.960 --> 2:18:37.120]  media says the black guy's bad or a guy didn't have his id in the library so they say give us your
[2:18:37.120 --> 2:18:42.560]  id says i don't have one so he gets on his knees and says please don't tazer me and they tazer him
[2:18:42.560 --> 2:18:46.400]  and that's the video or the guy with his hands up saying please don't taze me bro and they still
[2:18:46.400 --> 2:18:52.880]  taze or they taze you on the metro in in in canada now if you don't pay for your ticket i mean
[2:18:52.880 --> 2:18:58.960]  they're torturers they're criminals i mean it's all falling apart we just need a national id card
[2:18:58.960 --> 2:19:02.400]  that would simplify everything and that way everyone could carry it to be mandatory and no
[2:19:02.400 --> 2:19:07.680]  one would get in trouble right and that's what they're thinking that's the mentality behind this
[2:19:08.240 --> 2:19:11.520]  i mean you know that's how they're going to use this information against us i mean it's great
[2:19:11.520 --> 2:19:14.800]  that we're getting it out we have to tell people what's going on but you know their story you know

[2:25:04.640 --> 2:25:11.360]  big picture of how this is serious hardcore tyranny well we started uh shooting this uh
[2:25:11.360 --> 2:25:16.000]  about two and a half years ago it covers uh several of the events that were going on in
[2:25:16.000 --> 2:25:23.120]  washington uh over the 911 celebration uh that whatever you want to call it you know the the
[2:25:23.120 --> 2:25:28.480]  big um events that they were having democracy now and all of those people demonstrations
[2:25:28.480 --> 2:25:33.120]  everybody's out on the street all you have to do is walk up to someone and say hey we're making
[2:25:33.120 --> 2:25:38.240]  a documentary about the government you know and really in washington that's all you have to say
[2:25:38.240 --> 2:25:44.960]  and you've got somebody shooting off 10 things that they're kicked off about so um you know we
[2:25:44.960 --> 2:25:52.080]  did a lot of that obviously on the west coast and the east coast um we pulled together a kind of a
[2:25:52.080 --> 2:25:59.920]  small team of of attorneys who are you know really who i consider you know professional
[2:25:59.920 --> 2:26:06.800]  constitutional experts you know like jonathan turley um i mean this guy yeah he's huge he's he's
[2:26:06.800 --> 2:26:13.040]  he's keith oberman's favorite yeah well he's my favorite too i mean he says the right things
[2:26:13.040 --> 2:26:16.480]  and uh he said all the right things for this documentary i guarantee that the man knows what
[2:26:16.480 --> 2:26:20.960]  he's talking about he cries out continually against the bush administration these laws
[2:26:20.960 --> 2:26:24.880]  that have been passed and he gives you the constitutional reason you know he tells you
[2:26:24.880 --> 2:26:29.360]  exactly why this is wrong and this is why it was so great to have him be a part of this and
[2:26:29.360 --> 2:26:37.840]  be able to go to washington and shoot a documentary with jonathan turley um you know that's you know
[2:26:37.840 --> 2:26:41.760]  one of my dreams i mean just like you know some of the other ones where we got in uh jim marz or
[2:26:42.480 --> 2:26:48.960]  john vion you know these people i've been following for 10 years now and you know i'm
[2:26:48.960 --> 2:26:55.280]  actually getting to work with some of these people and um you know uh you know just the
[2:26:55.280 --> 2:27:02.880]  just the value of having those people in your documentary because they're so well known and so
[2:27:04.000 --> 2:27:07.920]  articulate in the way they explain that your rights are being taken away and you're
[2:27:08.640 --> 2:27:12.000]  watching it happen right underneath your nose now what are we going to do about it because
[2:27:12.000 --> 2:27:15.520]  and instead of talking yourself blue in the face trying to talk to your friends family
[2:27:15.520 --> 2:27:20.960]  neighbors say hey this is a pretty wild movie tell me what you think and 90 of the time you've
[2:27:20.960 --> 2:27:25.600]  just unlocked a mind that the government has spent from cradle to wherever they're at their life
[2:27:25.600 --> 2:27:30.560]  hundreds of thousands of dollars in propaganda a piece uh just a brainwashing you can break
[2:27:30.560 --> 2:27:37.760]  enemy propaganda with one dose of truth that's the magic power of truth lies are expensive
[2:27:37.760 --> 2:27:44.800]  faulty hard to hold up truth is like a a a a particle beam uh anti-matter compared to him
[2:27:44.800 --> 2:27:53.600]  i love the way you uh descriptively show people those things i guess in radio you
[2:27:53.600 --> 2:27:59.040]  kind of have to paint a picture for everyone uh fortunately for for a video we can just show
[2:27:59.040 --> 2:28:04.400]  them what we want them to see and uh i think in you're going to find that in in in washington
[2:28:04.400 --> 2:28:10.560]  you're fired unlike i guess the other four that i've worked on maybe beyond treason is an exception
[2:28:10.560 --> 2:28:18.160]  but um there's there's no conspiracy theory in this it is it is simply a matter of fact that
[2:28:18.160 --> 2:28:22.560]  this is the bill here's the people who signed it here's the democrats here's the republicans
[2:28:22.560 --> 2:28:26.560]  you'll notice that it's about the same number of each and here's what the bill does to you
[2:28:26.560 --> 2:28:30.560]  you know this is how it affects your rights and of course at the end of each one of these
[2:28:30.560 --> 2:28:36.320]  little segments that we do on the uh particular legislation we like to give out ways that people
[2:28:36.320 --> 2:28:45.440]  can combat these things um bor dc dot org is a great website it's the um bill of rights defense
[2:28:45.440 --> 2:28:51.760]  committee they actually help organize groups and individuals around the country to be able to
[2:28:51.760 --> 2:28:57.920]  enact legislation in your community that says the patriot act is not valid here all right i don't
[2:28:57.920 --> 2:29:02.880]  i don't know if your audience is aware of this or not but there's like about 450 resolutions that
[2:29:02.880 --> 2:29:08.400]  have passed that says by the way i'm not bragging but william did you know that i came up with that
[2:29:08.400 --> 2:29:14.960]  idea six months before they and said we should form groups and and and have cities and counties
[2:29:14.960 --> 2:29:20.160]  and states pledge not to do this i don't doubt it but now it's happening well i'll be my point is
[2:29:20.160 --> 2:29:26.240]  is that that's the power of just ideas and the listeners here carried the ball awesome is one
[2:29:26.240 --> 2:29:31.600]  of the first cities to do it and uh it's something i'm very very proud of it is one of my accomplishments

[2:32:47.680 --> 2:32:56.400]  in april of 2007 representative jane harman introduced one of the most terrifying bills
[2:32:56.400 --> 2:33:02.400]  ever to make its way onto the house floor the violent radicalization and homegrown terrorism
[2:33:02.400 --> 2:33:09.280]  prevention act of 2007 amends the homeland security act of 2002 and seeks to add provisions
[2:33:09.280 --> 2:33:15.520]  pertaining to the prevention of homegrown terrorism the bill's focal point is centered
[2:33:15.520 --> 2:33:21.440]  on terrorism by individuals born raised or based and operating primarily in the united states
[2:33:22.560 --> 2:33:28.400]  hr 1955 specifically targets the civilian population of the united states and makes
[2:33:28.400 --> 2:33:38.800]  having certain thoughts a crime this bill makes it a crime for the people of the united states
[2:33:38.800 --> 2:33:43.840]  to have certain thoughts floating around in their head that may be contrary to the conventional
[2:33:43.840 --> 2:33:51.280]  wisdom of the current administration are you a terrorist you just might be as defined in the
[2:33:51.280 --> 2:33:57.360]  bill homegrown terrorism is a term meaning the use planned use or threatened use of force or
[2:33:57.360 --> 2:34:03.440]  violence by a group or individual i think we can all agree that preventing violence is a good thing
[2:34:04.000 --> 2:34:08.640]  but the red flag being waved in front of our faces actually comes from the use of the word force
[2:34:08.640 --> 2:34:15.760]  according to the american heritage dictionary the word force is defined as the capacity to
[2:34:15.760 --> 2:34:23.040]  do work or cause physical change intellectual power or vigor especially as conveyed in writing or
[2:34:23.040 --> 2:34:31.280]  speech a capacity for affecting influencing or persuading the mind or behavior here's where
[2:34:31.280 --> 2:34:36.800]  you really begin to understand what the bill is attempting to regulate let's read the bill's
[2:34:36.800 --> 2:34:44.160]  intended uses and substitute the word force with the actual definitions homegrown terrorism is a
[2:34:44.160 --> 2:34:50.640]  term meaning the use planned use or threatened use of intellectual power or vigor especially as
[2:34:50.640 --> 2:34:58.000]  conveyed in writing or speech homegrown terrorism is a term meaning the use planned use or threatened
[2:34:58.000 --> 2:35:05.840]  use of persuading the mind or behavior of another person according to the bill you might be a terrorist
[2:35:05.840 --> 2:35:12.080]  if you use or plan to use your powers of persuasion to change someone else's mind either through writing
[2:35:12.080 --> 2:35:20.560]  or through speech can anyone say 19 freaking 84 this bill makes anyone into a terrorist for simply
[2:35:20.560 --> 2:35:27.360]  aspiring to affect political religious or social change anyone attempting to think teach or promote
[2:35:27.360 --> 2:35:33.120]  concepts that challenge conventional thinking or popular wisdom would be labeled and dealt with
[2:35:33.120 --> 2:35:40.000]  as criminals my question for our legislators is who gets to decide what's a thought crime
[2:35:41.200 --> 2:35:45.040]  will the definition of thought crimes change from administration to administration
[2:35:46.400 --> 2:35:51.280]  will the people of this country be sentenced to death or merely imprisoned for questioning
[2:35:51.280 --> 2:35:57.600]  the conduct of their leaders in washington if signed into law this piece of legislation
[2:35:57.600 --> 2:36:01.840]  will single-handedly strip americans of the most essential birthright that we have
[2:36:01.840 --> 2:36:07.600]  the freedom of conscious thought the very foundation upon which our first amendment

[2:38:14.000 --> 2:38:19.280]  destroying it and saying that they've got to move to prop it up or it may completely implode
[2:38:19.280 --> 2:38:24.480]  causing a worldwide depression london telegraph roiders experts see depression parallels in
[2:38:24.480 --> 2:38:30.560]  u.s crisis big article from roiders and their financial reporter saying that they see a depression

[2:38:37.840 --> 2:38:44.720]  today uh financial collapse will end the iraq occupation but it won't come at a time of washington's
[2:38:44.720 --> 2:38:50.320]  choosing that ties into it as well bob Chapman a lot has developed since you were on with us
[2:38:50.320 --> 2:39:00.240]  last friday what do you see happening well jen paul jen claude junker is the president
[2:39:00.240 --> 2:39:08.000]  of luxembourg and as you know it's a very small country he's also the chairman of the uh financial
[2:39:08.000 --> 2:39:16.880]  board with the g7 and i don't know that uh what he has to say carries a terrific amount of weight
[2:39:18.080 --> 2:39:27.600]  but that said look they all know that uh the the other currencies have to go down against the dollar
[2:39:27.600 --> 2:39:33.440]  because of the tremendous problems that are involved a lot of which uh or commonly in incited
[2:39:33.440 --> 2:39:39.600]  in a lot of which are the result of the u.s being the local motive of the world for so many years
[2:39:40.480 --> 2:39:45.040]  and you know these people don't appreciate that it's what like what have you done for me lately
[2:39:45.840 --> 2:39:52.720]  and um you know my question and i was just uh writing something about that and and my question
[2:39:52.720 --> 2:40:03.760]  is uh uh mr yonka uh how about the manipulation of the markets already by the central banks
[2:40:04.320 --> 2:40:10.160]  why don't you talk about that he's talking about coming in and assuring up the dollar
[2:40:10.160 --> 2:40:17.200]  let me tell you something that's a 3.2 trillion dollar a day market they might be able to affect
[2:40:17.200 --> 2:40:26.560]  it for two or three days end of story so it's hollow what what is behind this is they wanted
[2:40:26.560 --> 2:40:31.440]  to rally the stock market and that they did they've done it over the last several days
[2:40:32.160 --> 2:40:38.960]  i'm sure all of the aluminum is pitched in and did their part and they want the market up high
[2:40:38.960 --> 2:40:43.520]  you know why because it's going to go back down again that's why because the news is dreadful
[2:40:43.520 --> 2:40:53.440]  and so you see these little pieces come out which are really propaganda look the euro has been under
[2:40:54.400 --> 2:41:00.240]  valued versus the dollar for years and now you take into consideration the problems that the
[2:41:00.240 --> 2:41:07.040]  dollar has the euro should go higher and the reason they don't want it to is they can't
[2:41:07.040 --> 2:41:14.080]  make as much money and if they step in and try to hold the dollar at these levels they're going to
[2:41:14.080 --> 2:41:20.240]  buy lots of dollars that are depreciating and so this guy is whistling in the wind and nothing
[2:41:20.240 --> 2:41:26.640]  is going to change the underlying problems and yes uh the europeans are making noises
[2:41:27.440 --> 2:41:33.840]  but i have to because they're all politicians and they're getting all kinds of questions from
[2:41:33.840 --> 2:41:39.520]  manufacturers are saying oh my goodness uh we're going to have a 160 euro how can they make any
[2:41:39.520 --> 2:41:44.960]  money and so they got to come out with something well that's it it's more of acting like they're
[2:41:44.960 --> 2:41:49.520]  trying to stop this slide but fundamentally enough of the establishment wants the slide
[2:41:49.520 --> 2:41:55.680]  that is continuing i mean uh how is why is that happening a and then b bob Chapman i want
[2:41:55.680 --> 2:42:01.680]  william to comment on this uh why are they allowing it to happen but then b what will it look like
[2:42:01.680 --> 2:42:06.320]  from your intelligence background and financial background and your incredible skills at forecasting
[2:42:06.320 --> 2:42:10.240]  and that's really why you're you're important is because you have forecasted for decades
[2:42:10.240 --> 2:42:15.360]  accurately at about a 95 percent which is better than most people that i know of even at the highest
[2:42:15.360 --> 2:42:21.600]  levels of forecasting uh what will it look like in the u.s if we go into a hyper depression i mean
[2:42:21.600 --> 2:42:28.000]  what do you forecast people are going to behave like probably at some point in time like a bunch
[2:42:28.000 --> 2:42:34.080]  of wild animals and you know the world lives on its stomach and it also has to have a house or
[2:42:34.080 --> 2:42:38.160]  an apartment to live in it would you know these people getting thrown out of their apartments
[2:42:38.160 --> 2:42:44.160]  and houses because they can't pay their rent or their mortgage and the price of uh energy products
[2:42:44.160 --> 2:42:51.600]  and and food are going up astronomically and uh and so there's going to be a lot of people out of
[2:42:51.600 --> 2:43:00.320]  work uh the u.s economy is going to tank and i think part of this whole thing is and this is a
[2:43:00.320 --> 2:43:06.960]  guesstimate and i'm trying to think of what bershninsky's thinking and i think what they're
[2:43:06.960 --> 2:43:13.520]  trying to do here is i think they realize i mean an awful lot of money with globalization and free
[2:43:13.520 --> 2:43:21.360]  trade they gained an awful lot of control but it's gone out of control and i think they want to bring
[2:43:21.360 --> 2:43:27.200]  it to an end and i think this is one of the ways to do it by bringing the dollar down and then
[2:43:27.200 --> 2:43:35.120]  eventually putting on tariffs and the sidestep there that's why mi6 and the cia are sticking it
[2:43:35.120 --> 2:43:42.480]  to the chinese and to bet that operation was set up in 1948 and it's been going ever since so they
[2:43:42.480 --> 2:43:48.160]  see bob i have a problem i don't like the cia but i really don't like the communist chinese
[2:43:48.160 --> 2:43:52.240]  which our government helped put in power so that was kind of a dual the globalist always do
[2:43:52.240 --> 2:43:57.520]  dual ops as you know the cia and 49 back mal that's now declassified they also
[2:43:57.520 --> 2:44:02.560]  have the tibetans as a counterbalance and i like to side with the tibetans i like to side it you
[2:44:02.560 --> 2:44:08.160]  know against the communist chai comms so i mean where do you stand on that because i get few i
[2:44:08.160 --> 2:44:13.440]  rarely get kind of a do not compute you know robbie the robot do not compute but i i'm kind of
[2:44:13.440 --> 2:44:17.600]  deer in the headlights on this because i want to support the tibetans but we also know that the
[2:44:17.600 --> 2:44:23.840]  globalists are in there playing games with china i've lived in both switzerland and and in sweden
[2:44:24.400 --> 2:44:31.600]  and i'm neutral uh they're they're doing this to china that put them off balance because they
[2:44:31.600 --> 2:44:37.600]  want to show them that if you guys go out and kick out those dollars into the market you're gonna
[2:44:37.600 --> 2:44:43.360]  have a war in your hands they've also got pakistan and india uh hating china and that's why they
[2:44:43.360 --> 2:44:50.880]  help give them all newt's let me get a comment from william louis together they are like a mosaic
[2:44:50.880 --> 2:44:55.280]  let me get a comment from william louis filmmaker the new film available at info wars dot com
[2:44:55.920 --> 2:45:00.560]  washington you're fired william your take on financial warfare and what we see happening right now
[2:45:01.840 --> 2:45:05.840]  well you know the most obvious reason that you'd want to bring around uh a depression
[2:45:06.480 --> 2:45:12.160]  is because if you've got everyone out there scrambling to uh put food on the table and to
[2:45:12.160 --> 2:45:16.960]  keep a house over their head uh you know you're not necessarily concerned about who's being elected
[2:45:16.960 --> 2:45:22.320]  president or rights that are being taken away or any of the other really important things that are
[2:45:22.320 --> 2:45:26.160]  going on in this country you're a little bit more concerned with just staying alive and i think
[2:45:26.160 --> 2:45:31.680]  that's the intention i agree bob Chapman what do you think of this article out of the memphis
[2:45:31.680 --> 2:45:38.000]  daily paper the commercial appeal where thousands of officers from fifty plus federal state local
[2:45:38.000 --> 2:45:44.320]  agencies were federalized headline law enforcement agencies joined together for anti-terrorism initiative
[2:45:44.320 --> 2:45:48.240]  and i was told about this by locals the cops have been told they're getting ready for martial law
[2:45:48.240 --> 2:45:54.240]  then you read at nighttime curfews arresting people checkpoints randomly shaking everyone down
[2:45:54.240 --> 2:46:01.120]  hundreds of arrests for not having insurance or what i mean i i mean this is feds with military
[2:46:01.120 --> 2:46:06.160]  running around in memphis and they're calling in anti-terror and then randomly i mean this is a
[2:46:06.160 --> 2:46:10.000]  martial law takeover drill they admit it i mean this is in and they're doing this all over the
[2:46:10.000 --> 2:46:17.360]  country bob i know that for some time and all i can say is and i don't like to say this uh they
[2:46:17.360 --> 2:46:22.080]  better be get ready to get dead because that's what's going to happen the american people are not
[2:46:22.080 --> 2:46:27.600]  going to lay down for this there's 450 million weapons in this country and people know how to
[2:46:27.600 --> 2:46:32.720]  use them and if the mercenaries and the military and the police think they're going to stop them
[2:46:32.720 --> 2:46:39.360]  they're crazy they're going to get dead real fast well if one percent no color of law well if one
[2:46:39.360 --> 2:46:46.480]  percent of 150 million gun owners fights back that's 1,500,000 combatants and one percent
[2:46:46.480 --> 2:46:50.320]  is going to fight and i feel sorry for the cops because this is part of the globalist plan bob
[2:46:50.320 --> 2:46:56.320]  they're locked that's a terrible situation to be in and what they should do is speak out and say
[2:46:56.320 --> 2:47:03.760]  no i'm not going to do that i just can't believe it's coming out of the chief of police of hamburg
[2:47:04.320 --> 2:47:10.560]  when adolf hitler took out over in 1933 he called him into his office and burl in and he said
[2:47:10.560 --> 2:47:14.800]  and i don't know his name but anyway he said to him look you're a wonderful policeman i know you
[2:47:14.800 --> 2:47:20.080]  hate me but we need law and order and hamburg would you go and do that and he says yes i will
[2:47:20.080 --> 2:47:26.480]  at the end of the war when they had him in the war crimes trial he said all i did was follow the law
[2:47:26.480 --> 2:47:33.040]  you can't use that as an excuse by the way arnold sforzen here got confronted by we are changed today
[2:47:33.040 --> 2:47:38.160]  and they brought up that he wears a nazi belt buckle on tv his dad was the head of an entire
[2:47:38.160 --> 2:47:42.720]  his dad was equivalent of a colonel a captain in the ss as a colonel because they only have one
[2:47:42.720 --> 2:47:47.920]  general and that was hindry kimler it's it's it's a secret police model his dad ran an entire county
[2:47:47.920 --> 2:47:52.720]  an entire city of groz admittedly arresting tens of thousands of political dissidents to their death
[2:47:53.280 --> 2:47:58.720]  and this piece of trash is now the governor of one of our states and is calling for a police
[2:47:58.720 --> 2:48:05.280]  state i mean the humiliation this country has to put up with bob it's incredible and look at the
[2:48:05.280 --> 2:48:12.320]  three dolts that we have running for president of course ron paul you know may make it if uh
[2:48:12.320 --> 2:48:17.360]  if mr mccain has a heart attack or something but you know those three people are awful
[2:48:20.400 --> 2:48:25.360]  yeah i have no idea how it ever got to this point william louis it you ever feel like you're living
[2:48:25.360 --> 2:48:32.800]  in a nightmare for the past 10 years man um yeah i mean and you know this is just a typically
[2:48:32.800 --> 2:48:36.640]  iceberg of the stuff that we're talking about today there's so much accumulated uh
[2:48:37.360 --> 2:48:41.520]  you know problems with this uh country this you know the problems that we're talking about now a
[2:48:41.520 --> 2:48:47.120]  lot of them started uh decades and decades ago and we're just now seeing their evil plan
[2:48:47.760 --> 2:48:51.680]  uh blossoming you know we maybe we didn't understand what was going on at the time
[2:48:51.680 --> 2:48:56.000]  but i think we've got a pretty good idea of it right now and you know this is this is the time
[2:48:56.000 --> 2:49:00.160]  to do something people this is the time to pick up that video weapon that you have and start showing
[2:49:00.160 --> 2:49:05.120]  it to people bob here's another story a well-known palestinian activist no criminal record a local
[2:49:05.120 --> 2:49:10.960]  school teacher had been arrested and they tried to frame him he was suing the fbi he was found hands
[2:49:10.960 --> 2:49:17.520]  feet and mouth gagged bound dead in the river in austin and the fbi went and fished him out and said
[2:49:17.520 --> 2:49:25.200]  oh he committed suicide today in austin well that just goes to show you that you can't trust the fbi
[2:49:25.200 --> 2:49:31.120]  and if they come to your house you know what to do you know one of the other programs i was on the
[2:49:31.120 --> 2:49:38.080]  other night uh you know reverend butch pa yes he's on your network and i've been on with butch for
[2:49:38.080 --> 2:49:45.840]  over 10 years and he said the secret service was in there threaten them this week the only reason
[2:49:45.840 --> 2:49:54.880]  they don't threaten me is they can't find me yeah it's it's it's just amazing you know i've been at
[2:49:54.880 --> 2:50:03.360]  this 49 years and uh you know we were kind of like the uh uh the four cavalry heroes uh g edward
