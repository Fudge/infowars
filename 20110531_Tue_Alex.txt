[00:00.000 --> 00:12.800]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.800 --> 00:21.560]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:21.560 --> 00:29.720]  well strap yourselves in ladies and gentlemen because I had a few days off
[00:29.720 --> 00:35.720]  and I am recharged locked and loaded ready to go so start your engines we're
[00:35.720 --> 00:39.680]  gonna be live here for at least the next three hours today we're also gonna look
[00:39.680 --> 00:45.080]  at the amazing aftermath of our storming of the Capitol last Wednesday and all
[00:45.080 --> 00:51.320]  the great Texans and now we have the state of Utah following suit saying
[00:51.320 --> 00:57.880]  they will not give in to the federal threats of a blockade so that is
[00:57.880 --> 01:01.760]  happening we've now been an example to others in Utah and other states are
[01:01.760 --> 01:06.440]  saying they're going to be standing up to the system and no to the new federal
[01:06.440 --> 01:11.120]  security goon force groping small women and children and violating the Fourth
[01:11.120 --> 01:18.080]  Amendment in a big big way also to give us his take on this and a lot more like
[01:18.080 --> 01:27.020]  the bill that they tried to get Obama to sign that gives the president unlimited
[01:27.020 --> 01:31.520]  power to wage war anywhere anytime they feel like it unconnected to Congress
[01:31.520 --> 01:37.800]  Obama said no I'm not signing it because it doesn't give me enough power and the
[01:37.800 --> 01:43.000]  thing basically gave him total power and it's completely unconstitutional and
[01:43.000 --> 01:47.720]  historically completely insane and the ACLU came out and said oh look Obama
[01:47.720 --> 01:51.760]  promises to veto this bill and Paul Watson wrote a big article on that
[01:51.760 --> 01:56.320]  breaking it down remember Obama three months ago when they started the Libya
[01:56.320 --> 02:04.400]  attack said we'll only be there a couple days and he went on and and promised
[02:04.400 --> 02:08.800]  Congress that now here we are almost three months later and they had the UN
[02:08.800 --> 02:13.480]  authorization of force Obama said that's all I need I don't need Congress's
[02:13.480 --> 02:16.520]  approval and then when Congress complained a month into it he put another
[02:16.520 --> 02:20.960]  letter out saying this is about the credibility of the UN that's a quote
[02:20.960 --> 02:25.440]  the credibility and it is it's saying this is the authority this is where I
[02:25.440 --> 02:29.160]  get my authority not the American people and other control freak government
[02:29.160 --> 02:35.280]  activity giving an idea of what the Jenna 21 under UN serf to means San Diego
[02:35.280 --> 02:41.040]  newspaper Harold Tribune reporting here firework show needs new environmental
[02:41.040 --> 02:45.960]  review court ruling could have sweeping impact and another one here church lands
[02:45.960 --> 02:51.440]  of $4,000 fine for excessive tree pruning you're not even allowed in
[02:51.440 --> 02:55.000]  Charlotte, North Carolina to trim your tree under the new environmental
[02:55.000 --> 03:00.000]  tyranny but if you want to build nuclear reactors that blow up and send out now
[03:00.000 --> 03:06.160]  conservatively 10 times we're seeing reports of Chernobyl and it's building
[03:06.160 --> 03:10.040]  up in the US blowing across the Pacific you just raise the level of what you say
[03:10.040 --> 03:13.680]  is safe and everything's fine or you want to put genetically modified crops
[03:13.680 --> 03:21.720]  out now with the BT toxin that grows naturally in these crops so that bugs
[03:21.720 --> 03:27.560]  won't eat it or they do they die now being found reportedly by the AP Mike
[03:27.560 --> 03:31.400]  Adams covered this last week when he sat on Friday the great job being found in
[03:31.400 --> 03:37.400]  the blood of pregnant women it's on but let me tell you you want to shoot some
[03:37.400 --> 03:41.480]  fireworks off uh-huh it's all about regulating and taxing any type of
[03:41.480 --> 03:45.960]  combustion any type of carbon dioxide behavior because that's connected to all
[03:45.960 --> 03:51.000]  of the life systems on the planet and the carbon cycle itself so you control
[03:51.000 --> 03:55.280]  that one corner you control the entire global markets and then of course don't
[03:55.280 --> 03:59.680]  trim your tree first it's don't build a barn without permission or don't drill
[03:59.680 --> 04:03.160]  a well unless we say so we don't have rainwater collection or don't sell
[04:03.160 --> 04:07.560]  pumpkins on the side of the road or apples or peaches or pears or cranberries
[04:07.560 --> 04:13.200]  or milk heaven forbid or or or even worse cheese now you're gonna get swat

[04:42.800 --> 04:48.240]  session but Rick Perry has shown his true colors again we need to twist his arm
[04:48.240 --> 04:54.560]  right now because in the special session there's no mention of bringing back the
[04:54.560 --> 05:00.320]  legislation that they had 30 of the 31 votes they need to enforce the law against
[05:00.320 --> 05:05.560]  the TSA a very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness

[08:04.040 --> 08:23.760]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:23.760 --> 08:33.880]  it is the 31st day of May 2011 we're gonna be live here for at
[08:33.880 --> 08:39.640]  least the next three hours constitutional law expert Bruce Fine will be
[08:39.640 --> 08:45.000]  joining us to talk about the Congress attempting to hand Obama absolute
[08:45.000 --> 08:50.240]  dictatorial power to wage war worldwide and domestically including the
[08:50.240 --> 08:57.800]  assassination of US citizens no judge no jury no trial absolute hitlerian or
[08:57.800 --> 09:04.760]  Stalinistic Maoistic type powers now Obama has promised to veto that bill
[09:04.760 --> 09:12.040]  and he vetoes it saying it doesn't give him enough power meanwhile the left the
[09:12.040 --> 09:15.680]  control left hails it is oh look Obama's saying he didn't want this power no
[09:15.680 --> 09:19.560]  Obama says he wants even more power in the letter Paul Watson wrote about this
[09:19.560 --> 09:28.920]  in his article last Friday Obama's pledge to veto worldwide war bill rings
[09:28.920 --> 09:34.400]  hollow the ACLU came out and said oh how incredible Obama says he doesn't want
[09:34.400 --> 09:39.000]  these dictatorial powers the letter actually says I don't need you Congress
[09:39.000 --> 09:45.960]  I have the UN as he said months ago when Rand Paul sent him a letter along with
[09:45.960 --> 09:50.280]  other senators saying what is your power to be in Libya without getting
[09:50.280 --> 09:54.960]  congressional authorization he said I have the UN and I did it under UN
[09:54.960 --> 09:59.600]  authority for the credibility of the UN saying they're the boss not the elected
[09:59.600 --> 10:05.880]  representatives of the American people and it's UN regulations that are a run
[10:05.880 --> 10:09.920]  agenda 21 and the environmental assessments that have to be done now to
[10:09.920 --> 10:13.760]  trim your tree or have a fireworks display or the size of your toilet or
[10:13.760 --> 10:19.360]  light bulbs or these smoking bands these are all beta test for United Nations
[10:19.360 --> 10:25.000]  control worldwide and has absolutely nothing nothing to do with the
[10:25.000 --> 10:30.560]  environment so that is all coming up with the constitutional lawyer Bruce
[10:30.560 --> 10:36.800]  fine towards the end of the third hour today and again that headline Obama's
[10:36.800 --> 10:42.120]  promise to veto worldwide war bill rings hollow by Paul Joseph Watson is
[10:42.120 --> 10:48.240]  absolutely central and links through to the president's actual letter now
[10:48.240 --> 10:56.000]  coming up here in about 20 minutes from now Adam Kokesh former congressional
[10:56.000 --> 11:04.200]  candidate RT host currently Ron Paul big Ron Paul supporter Marine Corps
[11:04.200 --> 11:09.000]  veteran who's spoken out against the war he's going to be joining us because they
[11:09.000 --> 11:16.560]  had a protest at the Jefferson Memorial Thomas Jefferson Mr. Free Speech Tree of
[11:16.560 --> 11:23.120]  Liberty whole nine yards and they simply tried to quietly dance and they were
[11:23.120 --> 11:30.120]  arrested now I've been in DC and we have footage of this and I got a lot of
[11:30.120 --> 11:34.480]  we put out on YouTube years ago I've been in DC repeatedly if you try to set up a
[11:34.480 --> 11:39.320]  camera in the middle of the park 200 yards from anybody from anybody and
[11:39.320 --> 11:45.280]  videotape the Washington Memorial the big obelisk security guards run over and
[11:45.280 --> 11:49.960]  threatened to arrest you you explain it's your free speech right then the cops
[11:49.960 --> 11:53.480]  show up and you explain to them and they say yeah you're right and then they
[11:53.480 --> 11:57.880]  leave and then more cops come and they finally just say leave or we're gonna
[11:57.880 --> 12:01.880]  arrest you now we've been to the Jefferson Memorial we've been to the Lincoln
[12:01.880 --> 12:06.520]  Memorial and we walk in with cameras and they just walk over and say you're not
[12:06.520 --> 12:11.120]  allowed to do that well I was with C think a production company one of the
[12:11.120 --> 12:15.080]  times I was in DC it was the few days after Bilderberg 2008 we said why not
[12:15.080 --> 12:18.520]  go with this film crew wanted us to you know a few miles into DC we were in
[12:18.520 --> 12:23.320]  Gentilly Virginia and get some b-roll and stuff for upcoming films you see a
[12:23.320 --> 12:30.000]  lot of it in a Obama deception fall the Republic and we would be out front the
[12:30.000 --> 12:36.000]  White House and White House cops not even Secret Service but federal cops on
[12:36.000 --> 12:40.240]  bicycles will pull up so you can't video tape the White House and I'd say well
[12:40.240 --> 12:44.320]  you're letting that old lady right there videotape I'll get to her next and I'd
[12:44.320 --> 12:48.800]  say what's your what's your enforcement right look I'm gonna arrest you if you
[12:48.800 --> 12:54.240]  don't leave and it was the same thing trying to go the monuments you walk in
[12:54.240 --> 12:58.320]  try to videotape them they just they're there to let you know you're a slave I
[12:58.320 --> 13:04.680]  even at the Supreme Court had them come across the street I'm on a sidewalk
[13:04.680 --> 13:08.600]  across the streets video to my supposed Supreme Court that our tax money
[13:08.600 --> 13:11.840]  paid for it's my ancestors tax money paid for and they say you can't
[13:11.840 --> 13:16.640]  videotape and I tried playing good cop I went ahead and kissed the guys
[13:16.640 --> 13:24.120]  Rumpus and he said I guess you can for 10 minutes but then you got to go I mean
[13:24.120 --> 13:29.760]  it was incredible and this is land of the free home of the brave this is what
[13:29.760 --> 13:37.000]  we've turned into this is what we've become and I remember Free Republic big
[13:37.000 --> 13:41.880]  mainline conservative message board website it's huge back in the last year
[13:41.880 --> 13:46.280]  of Clinton's administration Clinton would have events in different cities and
[13:46.280 --> 13:49.880]  he had the first free speech zones they would say you're not allowed to be part
[13:49.880 --> 13:53.400]  of the spontaneous crowd cheering him outside a hotel or government building
[13:53.400 --> 13:56.760]  you've got to go down the street to barricade and Free Republic got real
[13:56.760 --> 14:02.040]  upset about it and and rightfully so I saw an article by then this morning with
[14:02.040 --> 14:09.360]  the dancing protesters at the Jefferson Memorial and they said hey it's the
[14:09.360 --> 14:18.200]  rules get used to it you deserve to be arrested really so if you see a group is
[14:18.200 --> 14:24.360]  liberal I don't know why they even call them liberal more libertarian they
[14:24.360 --> 14:29.560]  deserve to be arrested but then you don't deserve to be arrested now going
[14:29.560 --> 14:34.200]  back to the state of Texas on this issue the foreign news crew that was here
[14:34.200 --> 14:38.040]  even local media couldn't believe that I'd march into the Capitol and then I
[14:38.040 --> 14:42.040]  would scream at lobbyist and I would scream at politicians that's what that
[14:42.040 --> 14:45.760]  temple and that's what it is it's a it's a temple that's what the mason's call
[14:45.760 --> 14:51.760]  those facilities that big goddess temple that's what they're designed on we
[14:51.760 --> 14:57.880]  studied the architecture that big dome female breast is supposedly is
[14:57.880 --> 15:03.000]  supposedly a place where liberty and freedom is worshiped if you go to the
[15:03.000 --> 15:06.400]  deep masonic teachings but they don't even follow their own teachings now the
[15:06.400 --> 15:10.760]  founding fathers some of mason's actually did so all you supposed mason's
[15:10.760 --> 15:15.400]  around the country who are headlong for the tyranny will shame on you but I have
[15:15.400 --> 15:19.280]  to say this about the temple over here in Austin when I went over to that
[15:19.280 --> 15:24.120]  masonic temple and marched in there and screamed at the money changers and the
[15:24.120 --> 15:28.520]  den of iniquity in their face they did what they were supposed to do they
[15:28.520 --> 15:34.520]  honored my liberty they honored what it was all about shocking people all over
[15:34.520 --> 15:38.720]  the country there's news articles all over Texas all over the US marveling
[15:38.720 --> 15:43.160]  that someone dare go into a Capitol with a hundred or so people was more than
[15:43.160 --> 15:50.480]  that over the whole evening and scream at folks who who were violating us you
[15:50.480 --> 15:54.200]  have the elected representatives a hundred thirty eight to zero the entire
[15:54.200 --> 16:02.000]  house no abstentions voting for absolute law to be enforced that if a cop or a
[16:02.000 --> 16:06.560]  state police officer or a citizen or an FBI agent can't randomly stick their
[16:06.560 --> 16:09.520]  hands down your pants or grope you on the outside it's a fourth amendment
[16:09.520 --> 16:15.720]  violation that how can this new federal force you only nine years old do it
[16:15.720 --> 16:20.320]  always wanting more more more and it's already on the books as I've had state
[16:20.320 --> 16:23.200]  reps on to break that down I've had district attorneys on it's already
[16:23.200 --> 16:27.520]  illegal misdemeanor on the outside felony on the inside Texas says felony
[16:27.520 --> 16:31.440]  on the outside and if you want to grab a woman on the crotch in a park you get
[16:31.440 --> 16:36.920]  charged the felony you should well how do they do it here one da I had on said
[16:36.920 --> 16:41.080]  it's only a misdemeanor regardless enforce it we don't even need a new
[16:41.080 --> 16:46.400]  bill we need to have the state police be ordered by the state we need to enforce
[16:46.400 --> 16:51.320]  the law but regardless pass a law give the feds fair warning some of the media
[16:51.320 --> 16:54.160]  said well it's ineffectual who cares if the state passes the feds will just
[16:54.160 --> 16:58.280]  ignore it no the feds understood this was a state rights challenge and at a
[16:58.280 --> 17:05.120]  federal level trying to also enforce the fourth amendment so the feds said
[17:05.120 --> 17:10.720]  we'll run a blockade we'll run a no-fly zone we'll shut your state down now
[17:10.720 --> 17:16.800]  that's the difference between a state that honors liberty and freedom Texas
[17:16.800 --> 17:22.000]  isn't perfect but it's known as the you know state where the straight talk and
[17:22.000 --> 17:27.560]  and and people are rugged individualist and the house did the right thing led
[17:27.560 --> 17:31.800]  the way in the nation of these other 20 plus states looking at it they passed it
[17:31.800 --> 17:37.200]  in the house three times unanimous went to the Senate had 30 to 31 votes way
[17:37.200 --> 17:41.600]  more votes than we needed and you know why they had to kill it because it was
[17:41.600 --> 17:44.720]  veto proof the governor wouldn't have been able to veto something with that
[17:44.720 --> 17:50.720]  many votes and Rick Perry needs to play like you know now he's anti-naft to
[17:50.720 --> 17:54.000]  superhighway he was the champion he was the guy trying to forcibly inoculate
[17:54.000 --> 17:58.800]  girls with a deadly Gardasil shot on record killing people he's the guy who
[17:58.800 --> 18:04.000]  got the state franchise tax paid that is an income tax on business owners that
[18:04.000 --> 18:10.120]  got the hospital district tax pass that is a property tax on businesses I mean
[18:10.120 --> 18:16.480]  this guy is about as conservative as Bill Clinton I mean he literally is an
[18:16.480 --> 18:21.200]  Al Gore with a Texas accent prancing around and now that he's getting ready
[18:21.200 --> 18:26.960]  to run for president he has positioned himself as let's the seed fight the new
[18:26.960 --> 18:30.560]  world order meanwhile three years ago it's in my film in game film ends with
[18:30.560 --> 18:37.920]  it three and a half years ago he goes to Bilderberg 2008 now Bilderberg 2007 was
[18:37.920 --> 18:45.400]  it 8F no 2008 no 2007 in Greece so he's a globalist showing that we're getting
[18:45.400 --> 18:53.040]  him ready for president then and so here's the difference even 20 years
[18:53.040 --> 18:56.360]  ago nobody got permits to demonstrate because you don't need a permit for
[18:56.360 --> 18:59.360]  something that's already a right a license or a permit is authorization to
[18:59.360 --> 19:05.600]  do something that's already illegal so you've got to get permission and now
[19:05.600 --> 19:09.720]  look at us where you try to and I saw him do it to tourists to any excuse for
[19:09.720 --> 19:14.600]  the security guards the cops the mall cops to get in your face to treat you
[19:14.600 --> 19:20.400]  like a slave to scream at you to treat you like garbage in the nation's
[19:20.400 --> 19:27.960]  supposed heart in in the in the cradle of our Republic and it's the same thing
[19:27.960 --> 19:32.800]  in many other states but whether you agree with our views against the TSA
[19:32.800 --> 19:37.520]  groping or disagree or whether you agree with the folks in Madison, Wisconsin or
[19:37.520 --> 19:43.880]  disagree that taken over the Capitol that is what true freedom looks like and
[19:43.880 --> 19:48.280]  that's the proper position of government and citizen when you have liberty the
[19:48.280 --> 19:51.320]  government fears the people and you have tyranny the people fear the

[25:18.480 --> 25:26.200]  days but this is a fight that not just the US faces but worldwide the threat of
[25:26.200 --> 25:31.360]  staged and manufactured and provocateur terror there's also terror that's real
[25:31.360 --> 25:36.040]  and generally protected is being used as an excuse to destroy our liberties and
[25:36.040 --> 25:40.840]  our freedoms and the good news is Utah and others are saying they're gonna call
[25:40.840 --> 25:44.640]  the bluff of the feds they're introducing the legislation that's a
[25:44.640 --> 25:48.880]  carbon copy of the state of Texas so very exciting things are happening now
[25:48.880 --> 25:54.680]  the state concluded its session that they have every two years they had to go
[25:54.680 --> 26:00.200]  into emergency session the Fort Worth Star Telegram reports after senator
[26:00.200 --> 26:09.280]  Wendy Davis of Fort Worth had a filibuster Rick Perry did not want a
[26:09.280 --> 26:12.720]  special session because he doesn't want to announce he's running for president
[26:12.720 --> 26:17.840]  until the session's over so that stalls him another month or so and they're now
[26:17.840 --> 26:22.760]  saying it could last as long as 30 days but Perry so far has only brought two
[26:22.760 --> 26:28.200]  bills up in the Texas special session that he's called the school aid package
[26:28.200 --> 26:38.360]  and a Medicaid delivery package now he's got a special session 30 days for those
[26:38.360 --> 26:43.680]  two pieces that were on the verge of being hammered out no Perry I thought
[26:43.680 --> 26:48.240]  you said Perry see caught right here he always does this he's a master politician
[26:48.240 --> 26:53.240]  he has his minion came up with him under Carl Rove David Dewhurst Lieutenant
[26:53.240 --> 27:00.480]  Governor who can kill things in the Senate one of the strongest positions
[27:00.480 --> 27:03.920]  that state government ever created is the Texas Lieutenant Governor has more
[27:03.920 --> 27:08.760]  power than the governor he controls the Senate David Dewhurst the head of the
[27:08.760 --> 27:14.060]  Senate that's the Lieutenant Governor here what did he tell Senator Dan
[27:14.060 --> 27:18.640]  Patrick and others he said I don't want the public knowing I'm killing this I
[27:18.640 --> 27:22.280]  don't want my fingerprints on it and Rick Perry had said that it was a
[27:22.280 --> 27:28.640]  priority this bill be passed after the House unanimously passed it then his
[27:28.640 --> 27:32.520]  minion his best buddy the guy he campaigns with David Dewhurst secretly
[27:32.520 --> 27:39.840]  kills it and then Rick Perry it says was upset and frustrated by Davis's
[27:39.840 --> 27:47.360]  filler buster that was forcing the new special session called lawmakers back to
[27:47.360 --> 27:55.560]  work immediately on two bills among them the groping bill the TSA groping band
[27:55.560 --> 28:01.320]  is not among them think about the magnitude of that Perry is claiming he
[28:01.320 --> 28:05.920]  wants this bill passed but he has his fellow Republican fellow operative
[28:05.920 --> 28:13.280]  another CIA guy Dewhurst kill the bill he doesn't want that no they want to
[28:13.280 --> 28:20.120]  blame it all on the horrid state senator Kirk Watson who on the Democratic
[28:20.120 --> 28:24.320]  side reportedly was also helping kill it but this all falls with Rick Perry and
[28:24.320 --> 28:29.560]  David Dewhurst and if Rick Perry does not announce this bill and does not put
[28:29.560 --> 28:34.040]  it back into the special session you know he supports it and that should be a
[28:34.040 --> 28:37.680]  national issue when he runs for president that he secretly sided and got
[28:37.680 --> 28:41.360]  caught with the Obama Justice Department who was in there working with Dewhurst
[28:41.360 --> 28:45.960]  and now we know the governor because the governor has not brought this up now we
[28:45.960 --> 28:57.400]  need to lobby right now to call the governor's office and to absolutely
[28:57.400 --> 29:03.760]  blast him with phone calls now they have toll-free numbers if you want the
[29:03.760 --> 29:07.240]  citizen opinion line and that goes directly into a black hole it's a
[29:07.240 --> 29:21.560]  recorded message 800 2529600 800 2529600 I would call the main switchboard the
[29:21.560 --> 29:29.680]  main switchboards 512 463 2000 512 463 2000 512 463 2000 but I would do more
[29:29.680 --> 29:34.080]  than that he's deciding what to put in the special session I think today or
[29:34.080 --> 29:36.920]  tomorrow and I'm thinking about it right now we need to go back down there and
[29:36.920 --> 29:41.640]  this time go to Governor Rick Perry's office in the Capitol oh yes oh yes
[29:41.640 --> 29:46.720]  especially if Perry doesn't put it on the special session calendar now we know
[29:46.720 --> 29:51.920]  who to blame we're gonna go back to his office and Dewhurst office we're on the

[35:21.080 --> 35:25.960]  whole 10-minute clip here but it's up on info wars.com it's up at RT
[35:25.960 --> 35:29.680]  Adam versus the man but they ask him they go what's the law and they say I'm
[35:29.680 --> 35:35.760]  not gonna tell you there is no law okay and they body slam them into the
[35:35.760 --> 35:39.520]  ground we're gonna play that clip in a moment but the issue here is compare
[35:39.520 --> 35:43.720]  this to Texas where I march in with over a hundred people yell and scream at the
[35:43.720 --> 35:47.840]  in the politicians faces and they understand that's their place just like
[35:47.840 --> 35:52.160]  in Madison, Wisconsin in a free country the government fears the people the
[35:52.160 --> 35:55.720]  people don't fear the government and things are becoming completely 180
[35:55.720 --> 36:01.120]  degrees in the direction that they should be and so joining us is Adam
[36:01.120 --> 36:06.120]  Kilkesh Adam what made you decide to do this demonstration? I just felt like
[36:06.120 --> 36:10.640]  dancing we were challenging the cops to a dance off and apparently they didn't
[36:10.640 --> 36:16.720]  like our move so they decided to end it a little bit forcefully but if you see
[36:16.720 --> 36:20.000]  the video you can see what happened I think we made our point and we proved
[36:20.000 --> 36:25.920]  that the the parks police well as I would say to one of the officers there
[36:25.920 --> 36:31.000]  you know nice badge sorry about your penis but they you know they're not very
[36:31.000 --> 36:34.160]  good dancers and they're obviously compensated for something but I think
[36:34.160 --> 36:37.840]  you really hit the nail on the head here about the nature of government and fear
[36:37.840 --> 36:42.160]  and why this is such a powerful action and why we have now thousands of people
[36:42.160 --> 36:46.440]  coming back to the Jefferson Memorial next Saturday on June 4th the
[36:46.440 --> 36:51.960]  anniversary of Kenan Square to dance again so that their court rulings and
[36:51.960 --> 36:55.360]  their laws are relevant when we want to go out we want to have fun we want to
[36:55.360 --> 36:59.120]  start alright we're gonna do it whether or not they're gonna stop us it's not
[36:59.120 --> 37:03.760]  gonna matter and I you know which we show that the true nature of the police
[37:03.760 --> 37:08.080]  force with this it's they want us to be a pain I think the police officers there
[37:08.080 --> 37:11.960]  they knew they were being filmed they wanted to have forceful arrest they
[37:11.960 --> 37:15.160]  wanted to show people getting hurt they want to show us they were the boss what
[37:15.160 --> 37:18.960]  about this some of the some of the peaceful demonstrators who were doing
[37:18.960 --> 37:22.840]  German waltzes silently with the you know guy with his girlfriend they slam
[37:22.840 --> 37:28.120]  him and they're slamming their way back and forth that's right they arrested
[37:28.120 --> 37:34.280]  people for folks watching on TV for just barely moving now does not show proper
[37:34.280 --> 37:39.560]  respect to our gods but expanding on that Adam then some of you dare say what
[37:39.560 --> 37:43.880]  am I being charged with what have I done wrong and they say shut up and begin
[37:43.880 --> 37:49.400]  slamming people against the wall for then daring speak to the gods even while
[37:49.400 --> 37:53.600]  they're under arrest and police now admit they use tasers as a punishment as
[37:53.600 --> 37:58.240]  well well it's not exactly the god but but pretty close we were the Thomas
[37:58.240 --> 38:01.640]  Jefferson Memorial you know and it was really cool at the end of this event
[38:01.640 --> 38:05.920]  the statue of Thomas Jefferson came alive and started shooting lasers out of
[38:05.920 --> 38:09.680]  its eyes and killed all the police officers they were vaporized and
[38:09.680 --> 38:14.960]  there was justice served at the person memorial on Saturday but no we were
[38:14.960 --> 38:19.600]  talking about the foremost defender of speech and liberty in America's history
[38:19.600 --> 38:24.400]  not but as I've been finding out from people commenting on my Facebook page
[38:24.400 --> 38:28.240]  it's been really ironic but Thomas Jefferson incidentally was a large
[38:28.240 --> 38:33.920]  promoter of dancing and like to play the violin and would spontaneously bust
[38:33.920 --> 38:39.920]  out his fiddle and encourage people to dance it you know it's just amazing
[38:39.920 --> 38:43.880]  that the irony to this is that it keeps getting counted no I understand Adam let's
[38:43.880 --> 38:49.400]  expand on this now you a few dozen of you were there it looks like where this
[38:49.400 --> 38:53.680]  happened now you're coming back this next weekend and you're asking for more
[38:53.680 --> 38:57.680]  people to show up I think this is very important tell us the date and time and
[38:57.680 --> 39:03.760]  why you're doing this well yeah because you know the Hitler meme on YouTube
[39:03.760 --> 39:07.640]  people putting their own captions on that scene from from the movie where
[39:07.640 --> 39:11.320]  Hitler's angry with all his generals and they did one about this here they
[39:11.320 --> 39:15.080]  actually mentioned you in it Alex Jones it's a Alex Jones would have real
[39:15.080 --> 39:19.360]  credibility if it focuses people are able to challenge this authority here and
[39:19.360 --> 39:22.680]  you know that's what this is about it's about peaceful civil disobedience we're
[39:22.680 --> 39:25.600]  gonna go back we're gonna dance we're gonna tell them it doesn't matter but in
[39:25.600 --> 39:31.000]  that video they're saying oh we we pay we poison their air and their water we
[39:31.000 --> 39:36.320]  feel their daughter's vagina that they perform and now they won't just stop
[39:36.320 --> 39:40.440]  dancing and I think that's the power of an event like this so next Saturday at
[39:40.440 --> 39:44.560]  noon on June 4th we are going back to the Jefferson Memorial we were asked to be
[39:44.560 --> 39:48.920]  able to join us just join us in dancing silently with your headphones on we're
[39:48.920 --> 39:53.240]  not gonna drop any tourists that might be there their ability to enjoy the
[39:53.240 --> 39:56.320]  memorial the way that the judge who decided that this was illegal would be
[39:56.320 --> 40:00.120]  fit we're gonna do our thing we're gonna express ourselves we are going to pay
[40:00.120 --> 40:05.440]  homage to Thomas Justin not the way that the government sees fit but the way
[40:05.440 --> 40:09.600]  that we see fit and what we really revealed with what we did about this
[40:09.600 --> 40:12.920]  that is inspiring so many people to be involved why we know we're gonna have
[40:12.920 --> 40:16.920]  way more dancers back in a cell for round two of this dance off with the parts
[40:16.920 --> 40:22.280]  police is that's right Adam you've got to illustrate the absurdity by
[40:22.280 --> 40:27.320]  illustrating how absurd they are the police force is there to keep you
[40:27.320 --> 40:32.800]  safe or to protect you from terrorists or to chase down criminals those are
[40:32.800 --> 40:37.160]  just excuses for the two true real purposes of the police state for the
[40:37.160 --> 40:42.160]  government which is to generate revenue for the government and to control the
[40:42.160 --> 40:47.080]  population and that act is really laid bare by what we did and the actions of
[40:47.080 --> 40:50.480]  the police there on Saturday Adam let me ask you a question and we're gonna play
[40:50.480 --> 40:55.080]  a clip and and call you back on a landline here or at least try to so we
[40:55.080 --> 41:01.280]  can hear you Claire have you seen the footage of the way the state police
[41:01.280 --> 41:06.440]  capital police in Texas honored free speech honored the first amendment
[41:06.440 --> 41:15.400]  all right hold on we're just losing right I'm on RT studios right now we
[41:15.400 --> 41:20.120]  have we just don't happen after the RT operations in here we have an FBI
[41:20.120 --> 41:25.640]  officer so we might be getting a little bit of interference so why don't you go
[41:25.640 --> 41:28.840]  ahead and play that clip and I'll stay on the line and get that number and I'll
[41:28.840 --> 41:32.040]  be able to get you back on a landline here okay we'll call you right back Adam
[41:32.040 --> 41:39.400]  we're gonna go ahead and play this clip of the folks dancing and then once they
[41:39.400 --> 41:43.160]  started arresting members that were dancing Adam and others would just
[41:43.160 --> 41:47.960]  barely move their arms like they were grooving a little bit and the cops would
[41:47.960 --> 41:53.440]  run over and they look most of them like 12 year olds on power trips slam them
[41:53.440 --> 41:58.240]  down to the ground jump on them and then once they had them in handcuffs they
[41:58.240 --> 42:02.680]  would shove them against the wall if they dared talk and and also wanted to
[42:02.680 --> 42:07.800]  ask Adam I've been to DC twice in the last few years and every time the police
[42:07.800 --> 42:12.160]  the security guards that they have out in public places treats you like you're
[42:12.160 --> 42:17.080]  in North Korea I mean they scream at you with hatred like you have murdered
[42:17.080 --> 42:22.280]  their children and they've obviously been told run the slaves into submission
[42:22.280 --> 42:24.920]  break their will that's what this is all about let's go ahead and play that
[42:24.920 --> 42:33.320]  clip here it is
[42:44.240 --> 42:49.160]  we can dance we want to we can leave our friends behind because the cops don't
[42:49.160 --> 42:57.440]  dance and if they don't dance with it no friends of mine unbelievable
[42:57.440 --> 43:01.280]  they start arresting people that dare even swing their arms
[43:01.280 --> 43:04.720]  arrest them
[43:04.720 --> 43:20.120]  look they keep dancing illustrating how absurd this is I mean nothing's more
[43:20.120 --> 43:23.360]  important than our liberties and our freedoms
[43:23.360 --> 43:28.320]  all the mortars are wide open the war is increasing
[43:28.440 --> 43:33.680]  foreign banks have stolen 27 trillion and growing there's a young woman being
[43:33.680 --> 43:39.320]  arrested oh here's the slamming into the ground
[43:44.720 --> 43:50.400]  all right well there you have it and and then the footage goes on I suggest
[43:50.400 --> 43:54.480]  you watch the whole clip it's Adam versus the man.com or infoworks.com
[43:54.480 --> 44:00.760]  is up on both sides that once they get them in that position then if they dare
[44:00.760 --> 44:05.680]  speak back to their kings they're physically attacked land of the free
[44:05.680 --> 44:09.160]  home of the brave you can tell the government is here to let us know that
[44:09.160 --> 44:14.160]  we bet basically better step and fetch it now Adam you live in DC now so did I
[44:14.160 --> 44:18.520]  just have bad luck the last two times I was there to be 200 yards from the
[44:18.520 --> 44:22.760]  Washington Memorial videotaping for b-roll and it had people run up and
[44:22.760 --> 44:28.400]  threatened to arrest me or videotape from across the street at a park the the
[44:28.400 --> 44:32.920]  Library of Congress I could say that was bad work or that was because people
[44:32.920 --> 44:37.240]  you know especially would know who you are here but but they do that to
[44:37.240 --> 44:40.480]  anybody who's a threat in DC that's just how it works that's how it's set up it
[44:40.480 --> 44:45.200]  intended to suppress dissent so they don't want to be clear I'm clean cut
[44:45.200 --> 44:50.480]  in DC listen I'm clean cut with with with a national news crew just a couple
[44:50.480 --> 44:55.360]  guys with cameras on parks anywhere on sidewalks and they run over and get in
[44:55.360 --> 44:58.400]  your face and say you can't videotape and then and then the production crew
[44:58.400 --> 45:03.000]  said funny we went to the DC government asked for permits and they say we're a
[45:03.000 --> 45:07.480]  permit free city so see you got to get a permit that doesn't exist Adam well I
[45:07.480 --> 45:11.880]  would I would never attribute to conspiracy what can be adequately
[45:11.880 --> 45:15.880]  explained by government incompetent and that is certainly in a balance here with
[45:15.880 --> 45:20.040]  the confusion between 13 different agencies or so that have jurisdiction
[45:20.040 --> 45:23.960]  within the District of Columbia but they all have you know the same law
[45:23.960 --> 45:28.560]  enforcement police state mentality the same intent of suppressing rights and
[45:28.560 --> 45:32.640]  making sure that troublemakers stay out of the way of the politicians doing a
[45:32.640 --> 45:36.320]  thing screwing over the rest of America let me ask you this because your phone
[45:36.320 --> 45:39.720]  was cutting out you couldn't hear me have you seen our storming of the Texas
[45:39.720 --> 45:44.800]  Capitol and how can we played a clip of that on Adam versus the man after it
[45:44.800 --> 45:48.080]  happened I was very excited that she did something like that and very glad
[45:48.080 --> 45:52.200]  because we we covered it in terms of you know Rick Perry not having a spine to
[45:52.200 --> 45:55.440]  stand up to the federal government he's about to run for president I mean to the
[45:55.440 --> 45:59.480]  Republican Party be supporting such a supporter of the federal government
[45:59.480 --> 46:02.360]  over states right that's pretty offensive and I was really glad that you
[46:02.360 --> 46:06.400]  were there to call that out and stick it to them for that sure the reason I
[46:06.400 --> 46:12.640]  raised it though is illustrating our state police showing how government
[46:12.640 --> 46:18.400]  servants act honoring our boisterous you know in their face activity versus you
[46:18.400 --> 46:23.240]  guys what they did to you in DC I mean the two different Americas yeah no
[46:23.240 --> 46:27.920]  absolutely and this is something that I didn't expect to be so compelling but
[46:27.920 --> 46:32.000]  it's kind of striking now the significance of this you know obviously
[46:32.000 --> 46:36.920]  if you look at the footage I'm not much of a dancer and if there if there was
[46:36.920 --> 46:40.800]  such a thing as a legal definition of dancing the cops there were just as
[46:40.800 --> 46:45.320]  guilty of it as we were but a lot of people are saying well you know even if
[46:45.320 --> 46:49.360]  there is a legal definition of dancing there is no way that Adam Cokers can be
[46:49.360 --> 46:53.120]  guilty of this because the video clearly demonstrates that I can't dance the thing
[46:53.120 --> 46:59.440]  is about it being about dancing I know it's ridiculous but the reason I
[46:59.440 --> 47:02.360]  mentioned that Hitler video is because it really lays a bear and it talks about
[47:02.360 --> 47:07.280]  you and your and your message and if you say come protest on Fanto come
[47:07.280 --> 47:12.240]  protest the war come protest the president come you know it doesn't work
[47:12.240 --> 47:16.320]  you know and I've been doing that too and that's the thing that I've been
[47:16.320 --> 47:19.720]  blown away by the power of this that I never expected it to take off the way
[47:19.720 --> 47:24.120]  it has our video that we put up was the second one that got on YouTube it's
[47:24.120 --> 47:28.680]  already over 650,000 views right now the thing is yesterday we weren't even the
[47:28.680 --> 47:34.000]  top viewed video in news and politics on YouTube we were the top three viewed
[47:34.000 --> 47:39.280]  videos on news and politics it has been reposted it is going truly viral people
[47:39.280 --> 47:43.800]  all over the world now are organizing events to dance in solidarity with us
[47:43.800 --> 47:50.200]  on next Saturday at noon we have people coming from as far away as Dallas a
[47:50.200 --> 47:54.480]  friend of mine Jared Atkinson who's a big Ron Paul activist down there he's
[47:54.480 --> 47:59.080]  flying in to DC for this we have people all over the eastern seaboard driving
[47:59.080 --> 48:04.240]  insane all right you want to make it about dancing let's dance and they're
[48:04.240 --> 48:07.400]  throwing down and this is the thing that's bringing people together this is
[48:07.400 --> 48:11.040]  the thing that lays it bare for which none of their propaganda none of their
[48:11.040 --> 48:15.160]  arguments none of their bullshit divide and conquer strategies none of that is
[48:15.160 --> 48:20.360]  gonna mean crap next Saturday people are coming together to say you can't tell us
[48:20.360 --> 48:25.640]  not to dance simple as that and that it's so beautiful to see how people are
[48:25.640 --> 48:29.480]  coming together about this and it's all the videos that people are remixing for
[48:29.480 --> 48:33.120]  this I mean I told you there's two other videos that have over 400,000 views
[48:33.120 --> 48:37.720]  there's a dozen videos that are 100,000 views plus right now people are
[48:37.720 --> 48:42.720]  reposting you know the interview I did with with Russ at the day yesterday it's
[48:42.720 --> 48:46.440]  really amazing how this is getting around and people are quoting Gandhi
[48:46.440 --> 48:51.320]  now say you know that from the movie you can you know they they can break my
[48:51.320 --> 48:56.400]  bones they can kill me but when they do all they will have is my dead body but
[48:56.400 --> 49:01.160]  not my obedience and when I got arrested I was wearing very deliberately my
[49:01.160 --> 49:05.960]  Gandhi t-shirt it had a Gandhi's portrait on it and in the style of the
[49:05.960 --> 49:12.200]  Andre the giant obey except underneath it says disobey well Adam that's my
[49:12.200 --> 49:18.800]  point is that the the tyranny has gotten so absurdist now that the Texas
[49:18.800 --> 49:23.640]  tyrants did the smart thing and didn't arrest us because they knew it would lead
[49:23.640 --> 49:29.120]  to a chain reaction the DC tyrants did did the did the wrong thing and it's
[49:29.120 --> 49:33.680]  now gonna backfire high noon the Jefferson Memorial it's a genius idea
[49:33.680 --> 49:40.240]  and we've got to illustrate the tyrants absurdity by making them show us who they
[49:40.240 --> 49:44.680]  really are they could have laughed the guards could have even joined you it
[49:44.680 --> 49:49.480]  would have been a great thing if they had done nothing well who would have
[49:49.480 --> 49:53.320]  been the bigger ass I would have I would have stood there and dance for like you
[49:53.320 --> 49:56.520]  know ten minutes we would have all looked at each other awkwardly and walked
[49:56.520 --> 50:01.840]  away and be like yeah we defeated this little judges ruling and now it's a
[50:01.840 --> 50:06.600]  global phenomenon like that you know and I'm just I'm flattered that so many
[50:06.600 --> 50:10.320]  people are are inspired by but by it because I really wasn't counting on it
[50:10.320 --> 50:15.720]  but now I'm kind of like smacking myself in the forehead going you know but when
[50:15.720 --> 50:19.640]  I saw this event it wasn't my idea I got to give credit to the other organizers
[50:19.640 --> 50:24.880]  Eddie Dickie and Jared Denman who came up with the idea after the court ruling
[50:24.880 --> 50:29.600]  that said you couldn't dance there and I saw it I was just like absolutely you
[50:29.600 --> 50:34.160]  know I'm getting behind that and then then the video have you know the incident
[50:34.160 --> 50:37.720]  happened on Saturday the videos getting around and it's just kind of taken off
[50:37.720 --> 50:40.760]  from there but that's what's so beautiful Adam stay there I know you've got to go

[51:11.840 --> 51:17.160]  bonds to foreign central banks with Japan about to become a seller of US bonds
[51:17.160 --> 51:22.240]  in order to rebuild its own nation and the US antagonizing China by calling them
[51:22.240 --> 51:26.560]  currency manipulators the Federal Reserve which is already buying about 70% of
[51:26.560 --> 51:31.120]  US Treasuries will soon be the only buyer left of US Treasuries our friends at the
[51:31.120 --> 51:34.920]  National Inflation Association believe that the US dollar will soon become

[53:10.400 --> 53:14.080]  more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds have all performed even gold
[53:14.080 --> 53:17.120]  and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen
[53:17.120 --> 53:21.240]  again so our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect
[53:21.240 --> 53:26.720]  mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an

[53:30.680 --> 53:34.640]  best part these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you

[53:54.080 --> 53:58.240]  non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item this is Alex Jones for
[53:58.240 --> 54:01.600]  survivalseedbank.com
[54:01.600 --> 54:12.120]  you know watching the footage of Adam Kokesh and others being arrested you see
[54:12.120 --> 54:17.640]  this little toadie who's a quote professional tour guide very pleased
[54:17.640 --> 54:21.240]  they're being arrested and then the cops are kind of shoving him out of the way
[54:21.240 --> 54:25.800]  and he starts groveling to them you see these people that think freedom is all
[54:25.800 --> 54:31.080]  about licking government boots we need everywhere to let the system know
[54:31.080 --> 54:34.440]  that they're not gonna cow us and Adam earlier when your cell phone was cutting
[54:34.440 --> 54:37.120]  out I want you to continue with the point we're trying to make that if they're
[54:37.120 --> 54:41.520]  sticking their hands down our pants if they're grabbing us this this is about
[54:41.520 --> 54:45.160]  you're not gonna dance we're gonna touch your private parts we're gonna take
[54:45.160 --> 54:49.480]  blood at checkpoints I mean we've got to stand up and reignite that spirit of
[54:49.480 --> 54:54.640]  liberty and to watch how what you guys have done is catching fire what I've
[54:54.640 --> 54:58.720]  done with Ron Paul anytime somebody stands up for liberty it's having a huge
[54:58.720 --> 55:02.920]  effect because people are hungry for it please continue sure well it's from that
[55:02.920 --> 55:06.280]  I got the idea from the video that someone made on the the Hitler in the
[55:06.280 --> 55:10.640]  bunker meme it's so popular on YouTube and it's like Adam Kokesh finds out of
[55:10.640 --> 55:14.440]  or Hitler finds out about the Adam Kokesh dance party and he's saying how
[55:14.440 --> 55:19.640]  is this possible we we we feel their daughters vagina that the airports we
[55:19.640 --> 55:23.640]  tax them for 50% of their income they don't have any freedom left any
[55:23.640 --> 55:28.000]  freedom left anyway of course why wouldn't they obey us they have to obey
[55:28.000 --> 55:33.400]  us they have to stop dancing and one of the generals there you know we go cut to
[55:33.400 --> 55:38.440]  the general general goes my infielder I'm sorry they are there it didn't work
[55:38.440 --> 55:42.200]  as planned actually they they're coming back next Saturday and that's when he
[55:42.200 --> 55:47.080]  really explodes and says you know well if this works Alex people are gonna are
[55:47.080 --> 55:51.840]  gonna be giving Alex Jones but even more credibility and it's just it's
[55:51.840 --> 55:56.320]  really powerful but that's that's the thing and it's like why we have we we
[55:56.320 --> 56:00.040]  came the wheel we the people took it to this point we let our government get
[56:00.040 --> 56:03.040]  away with all of this other crap and then we're surprised that they say no you
[56:03.040 --> 56:06.840]  can't dance here and by the way if they want to call out the police dogs and the
[56:06.840 --> 56:11.200]  sound cannons then what same thing happened to Gandhi being beaten the
[56:11.200 --> 56:16.680]  head then that'll cause even more people to stand up and say no because the
[56:16.680 --> 56:21.240]  British Empire did the same absurdist things there well I want to commend you
[56:21.240 --> 56:25.600]  and the other activist there in DC too bad Luke couldn't be there but I know
[56:25.600 --> 56:29.800]  he's now gone to Europe ahead of time I think he's gonna be he's gonna be dancing
[56:29.800 --> 56:32.720]  in solidarity with us and that's what's really cool about this that so many
[56:32.720 --> 56:36.560]  people are inspired by by what what's going on their events be organized in
[56:36.560 --> 56:40.840]  Texas even probably I bet there's gonna be one at the Capitol in Austin you know
[56:40.840 --> 56:44.560]  do a little jigget noon for us in solidarity if you like but we're we are
[56:44.560 --> 56:49.720]  literally dancing down the police state here well I have to commend you and the
[56:49.720 --> 56:54.720]  good news in Texas is they're going to a special session we need to try to get
[56:54.720 --> 57:01.640]  Perry to add to the special session the anti-groping bill Perry claimed that he
[57:01.640 --> 57:05.240]  was backed off by the feds but but notice he didn't add this to the special
[57:05.240 --> 57:09.400]  session showing us that through Dewhurst who we know killed it behind the
[57:09.400 --> 57:13.680]  scenes that he doesn't want to be forced to vote on this as he gets ready to run
[57:13.680 --> 57:17.800]  for president so it's not just that he's been cowed he is a creature of Carl
[57:17.800 --> 57:23.200]  Rove and this system so no orders from headquarters just whoever's against this
[57:23.200 --> 57:28.200]  tyranny show up at the Jefferson Memorial yep and hopefully you guys can
[57:28.200 --> 57:32.560]  then go dance at some other memorials afterwards absolutely and there's not
[57:32.560 --> 57:37.120]  something that is being organized or put together by anybody I'm just inviting
[57:37.120 --> 57:41.280]  my friends to come join me next Saturday if you think that making dancing is
[57:41.280 --> 57:46.640]  illegal is bad then show up Saturday at noon at the Justin Memorial there's a

[01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:29.160]  and gentlemen with news and information we've got some other really important
[01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:32.800]  news we're seeing state supreme courts it's a battle between liberty and
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:36.680]  tyranny right now it's toe-to-toe the globalists can have committed so many
[01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:44.400]  crimes they've run wild they have stolen so much wealth engaged in so many
[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:50.280]  crimes they've got to close the door on freedom now because freedom and our
[01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:55.960]  Constitution and Bill of Rights Declaration of Independence created fail
[01:01:55.960 --> 01:02:00.480]  safe systems that if we use them will checkmate the globalist the globalist
[01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:06.960]  are illegitimate that's why they're trying to socially engineer us to be
[01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:13.000]  able to engage in whatever activity they want whenever they want and I know
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:19.960]  that many of you were awake to this fact but now is the time to reach out to
[01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:23.920]  everyone else we know and let them understand that we are going into a
[01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:28.560]  depression it has been designed and the globalist want to use the crisis they've
[01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:34.320]  created to get even more power and totally alter the makeup of our society a
[01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:39.640]  rewrite an overwrite of our system it needs to be resisted now the war is now
[01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:46.200]  the battle for liberty is now I'm also in the next segment going to give the
[01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:50.200]  number out and start opening the phones up throughout the balance of the
[01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:55.200]  broadcast until the last 30 minutes of the show when Ron Paul's favorite
[01:02:55.200 --> 01:03:02.200]  constitutional lawyer is going to be joining us Bruce Fine chairman of the
[01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:07.520]  American Freedom Agenda American Freedom Agenda.org he's going to be joining us to
[01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:13.720]  talk about Obama's promise to veto worldwide war bill rings hollow Obama says
[01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:16.200]  he'll veto that congressional bill because it doesn't give him enough power
[01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:25.080]  the thing basically gives him unlimited power so that is all coming up as well
[01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:29.960]  and then of course the state courts I mentioned like Indiana coming out two
[01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:38.240]  weeks ago and saying we can go in any house any time without a warrant for
[01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:43.680]  any reason or no reason at all the chief justice said and that ties into this
[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:49.680]  new Mexico Supreme Court lets cops grab guns during stops Supreme Court allows
[01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:53.800]  police to take all firearms from law abiding motorists during traffic stops
[01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:58.840]  even though they're completely and absolutely legal so that is coming up
[01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:06.960]  after the break as well also DNC chair says illegal immigration is not a crime
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:11.360]  notice the feds throw the book at you for things that shouldn't even be illegal
[01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:16.400]  and create all these new extra judicial laws for the general public regardless of
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:19.720]  what color race or religion you are if you're an American you're seen as a
[01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:24.920]  schmuck as a sucker as a cow to be fed on by these wolves but then meanwhile the
[01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:29.760]  illegals driving the wages down voting almost unanimously in anti-gun
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:34.300]  legislation whenever they do get legalized to vote very dangerous
[01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:40.360]  precedence we're gonna be going over all of that today and I'll go ahead and
[01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:44.480]  give the number out now on any of these subjects I've mentioned the toll free

[01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:21.880]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:26.200]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:29.960]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:34.080]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:38.080]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power

[01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:10.320]  victory other states are moving saying they will call the feds bluff Utah
[01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:16.160]  namely we've also got incredible nanny state activity fireworks shows need new
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:20.200]  environmental review court ruling could have sweeping impact that's in San

[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:37.760]  of the globalist just intensify we've also got the world health organization
[01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:43.480]  admitting what we already knew cell phones can cause increase cancer risk
[01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:49.400]  that's been known all along and it's time for folks to go hands-free that way
[01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:54.760]  it's only radio waves and on microwave radiation up close to your head still
[01:09:54.760 --> 01:10:02.440]  not good for you we're gonna be breaking all of that down today but let me first
[01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:09.400]  get into this report and then part of a video report unless you're a radio
[01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:13.480]  listener and don't pull up the news article and have basically lost your
[01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:19.280]  memory and don't remember this lie Obama US involvement in Libya action would
[01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:28.440]  last days not weeks that was a quote and now here we are many many months
[01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:37.080]  later close to three months after the UN declaration the United Nations said
[01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:40.520]  that it wouldn't be a war of the humanitarian action and that means
[01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:47.680]  attack helicopters 2,000 pound bombs hellfire missiles cruise missiles they
[01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:52.160]  it's now admitted that before the whole crisis began in the west of Libya
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:56.960]  bordering Egypt that US and British special forces were quote advising them
[01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:01.960]  they've now been videotaped on the ground with weapons on the front lines and
[01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:06.440]  again I'm no fan of Muammar Gaddafi but the fact is they've been trying to
[01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:09.920]  assassinating they've been killing members of his family while telling us
[01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:13.400]  oh we wouldn't violate international law we're not trying to assassinate his
[01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:20.280]  family oh this isn't a military action it's a kinetic action so in your face
[01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:25.760]  they've now surpassed in all of our faces they've now surpassed 1984 in
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:31.320]  ridiculous obvious lies that was the whole point of double-speak and double
[01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:36.000]  think and Orwellianism is that the lies were so ridiculous in the fictional book
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:40.360]  where for two years they say we're always at war with East Asia the next
[01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:44.600]  day we've never been at war with East Asia and if you say well you just said
[01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:48.040]  yesterday you were at war with East Asia and even have the newspaper article
[01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:51.800]  they would drag you off and torture you for six months until you were completely
[01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:57.920]  insane and actually believed that you've never been at war with East Asia and
[01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:03.280]  that's basically the type of world we're entering into where reality doesn't
[01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:08.360]  matter and they just throw all of this in our face and don't care but remember
[01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:14.440]  Obama said we'd be there maybe a week probably just a couple days they never
[01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:21.080]  intended to just bomb them for a few days it's a takeover and it'll take
[01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:26.040]  whatever they have to do to overthrow Qaddafi and bring in their Muslim
[01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:31.440]  brotherhood slash al-Qaeda Saudi Arabian back group they use the same folks
[01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:35.560]  against the Serbs same folks against the Russians it never ends and they use the
[01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:40.000]  same threat of the same group to put in the naked body scanners and the
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.760]  checkpoints and the national ID cards and the warrantless wiretapping and all
[01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:48.880]  of this corruption that's why I've always said al-Qaeda is the magic skeleton key
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:53.840]  it'll open any door for the New World Order as long as we buy into the hoax and
[01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:59.520]  then it we wake up to the stage terror then the hoax doesn't work anymore now
[01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:05.440]  continuing Obama US involvement in Libyan action would last days not weeks ABC
[01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:09.720]  news President Obama told a bipartisan group of members of Congress today that
[01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:13.560]  he expects the US would be actively involved in any military action against
[01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:17.600]  Libya for days not weeks after which he said the US would take more of a
[01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:21.880]  supporting role sources tell ABC news well I guess that supporting role is
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:26.960]  increasing with more and more US forces landing in the country and here's a clip
[01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:31.240]  from ABC news of that the unpredictable and dangerous mind of Momar
[01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:36.480]  Qaddafi today President Obama told Americans that US forces may be called
[01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:41.480]  into military action once again this time against Qaddafi joining other
[01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:46.040]  countries trying to keep the dictator from savaging his own people tonight we
[01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:50.560]  set out to answer three big questions will other countries like England France
[01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:55.320]  Arab nations really take the lead in Libya can the American military stretch
[01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:59.920]  so thin in Afghanistan and Iraq add another burden and is there a chance
[01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:05.040]  that Qaddafi will fold even though he's threatening retaliation our team has
[01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:07.920]  been reporting on this all day is standing by and we'll start with Jake
[01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:24.760]  you can watch the whole clip and it's got the clip later in there about Obama but the headline is Obama US involvement in Libyan action would last days not weeks see getting into a new war so oil companies get trillions more in oil that's called stepping up
[01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:29.440]  member Donald Trump came out and said we need to take the Iraqi oil for the American
[01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:34.320]  people as if you're ever going to get any of that oil you pay for the military
[01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:39.920]  takeover and then your oil prices go up they were angry at Iraq going back eight
[01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:44.640]  years ago because Iraq was over pumping and driving down the price go back to
[01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:49.680]  the newspapers at the time OPEC run by Saudi Arabia was hopping mad because to
[01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:56.160]  pay off his debts Saddam Hussein was over pumping and driving down prices that
[01:14:56.160 --> 01:15:02.520]  was saving you money by the way remember what Dr. Cortsey said a few weeks ago a
[01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:08.600]  week and a half ago he said look for now Donald Trump to not just get a 60
[01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:12.840]  million dollar contract with NBC for playing possum with Obama on the birth
[01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:17.760]  certificate but look for him to now get approval for the casinos he's trying to
[01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:24.200]  put in there in Chicago and Illinois here's Reuters Illinois House approves
[01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:27.880]  Bill on casinos in Chicago they've got their man
[01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:34.880]  Ram in Chicago interesting little coincidence I would say wouldn't you so
[01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:40.960]  we have this report and then we have other reports here footage of Western
[01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:46.600]  troops confirms criminality of war on Libya violates the UN's authorization and
[01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:51.400]  we have another report Gaddafi snatch squads took hundreds of men and boys
[01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:56.200]  from Miss Herata London Independent and maybe that's true I'm sure Gaddafi is
[01:15:56.200 --> 01:16:03.560]  is a bad guy the difference here is that our supposed government tortures
[01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:08.680]  secretly arrest in the new war powers bill it openly states the president can
[01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:14.200]  assassinate Americans in America expanding the War Powers Act expanding
[01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:18.640]  the Enemy Commissions Act the Enemy Combatant Act the Military Commissions
[01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:24.040]  Act expanding all of that well you read this article and it's terrible it says
[01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:29.120]  he may even be torturing man earlier they claim he ran to Venezuela and they
[01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:33.400]  claim that he had meant teams with Viagra raping women the State Department had
[01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:38.560]  to admit that that was not true oh well they had meant that was a lie but the
[01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:41.560]  public still thinks it's true because they heard it see they put the big lie
[01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:45.760]  out and announce it for a few weeks and then quietly retracted later kind of
[01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:49.120]  like the average American still thinks Saddam was throwing babies out of
[01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:52.440]  incubators even though six months after that war ended they admitted it was all
[01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:59.760]  a PR ploy and fake it's admitted to be a hoax but in some polls I've seen more
[01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:04.680]  than half of conservative Americans believe WMDs were found in Iraq I've
[01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:09.360]  seen polls out where more than half of Americans still believe that across the
[01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:12.840]  board babies were thrown out of incubators and it doesn't matter the
[01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:17.280]  State Department admitted that there weren't rape teams running around
[01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:22.520]  raping in mass I mean what a PR disaster that would be now they go on to talk
[01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:27.320]  about torture and things like this how can they criticize snatch and grab when
[01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:32.920]  our government's openly pioneering it and pushing it in the modern age how can
[01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:38.480]  they talk bad about torture when the good guys torture well wait Gaddafi must
[01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:42.040]  be the good guy then if he's torturing see this is the Orwellian double thing
[01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:47.480]  what's going on Gaddafi snatch squads took hundreds of men and boys it goes on
[01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:52.120]  the lifting of the siege of the embattled Libyan city has revealed the
[01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:57.040]  disappearance of hundreds of people yeah there was a war there with many of them
[01:17:57.040 --> 01:18:02.920]  suspect victims suspect victims of snatch squads loyal to Gaddafi regime
[01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:06.880]  relatives and rights workers said yesterday and see once they take that
[01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:10.840]  country over the globalist they'll be able to put in kangaroo courts that will
[01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:16.440]  in Didaham sandwich it's just like the Hague court is admittedly completely
[01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:20.560]  unfair you don't get to call your own witnesses most people end up dying like
[01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:27.520]  Sloven Milošević in custody it's just totally fake continuing a desperate
[01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:32.080]  search has begun for the disappeared in quotes many of whom were reported to have
[01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:36.360]  been taken away to regime prisons or killed during some of the fiercest
[01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:39.560]  fighting of the three-month rebel uprising that has reduced parts of the
[01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:43.440]  city to rubble witnesses accounts gathered by the independent and rights
[01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:46.680]  groups indicate there was a systematic attempt to kidnap men for parts of the
[01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:53.160]  city even worse there may have been torture and it goes on to talk about
[01:18:53.160 --> 01:19:01.400]  torture oh my gosh well wait but tortures good but wait it's bad but wait
[01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:05.960]  it's good but wait it's bad but wait it's good federal and state courts have
[01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:12.080]  ruled that police can use tasers as punishment when you're chained down or
[01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:16.160]  when you won't give a urine sample in a hospital bed that's standard procedure
[01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:22.880]  now in fact folks won't believe it a search please judge rules taser can be
[01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:31.000]  used for punishment torture I've got footage in my film martial law 911 rise
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:39.160]  the police state of police breaking people's arms for punishment is for
[01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:43.960]  sitting on the sidewalk in front of abortion clinics now whether what you
[01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:47.880]  think of abortion or not they're sitting there on a sidewalk and the federal
[01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:52.200]  judge ruled we can break your arms bones stick out purple bones out of the
[01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:57.640]  meat right out oh that's freedom that's torture that's what the good guys do so

[01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:37.120]  okay we'll go to your calls here in the next segment I wanted to finish up with
[01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:43.600]  this extra judicial tyranny so we have them hyperventilating over
[01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:50.240]  unconfirmed reports the Qaddafi has arrested guerrilla soldiers and that he
[01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:53.480]  may have tortured some of them they've told a bunch of other lies that have
[01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:56.360]  been proven to be lies but we're supposed to just believe whatever new
[01:24:56.360 --> 01:25:03.120]  garbage were fed under these psyops and now coming out last Friday Obama
[01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:09.440]  promises veto to worldwide bill rings hollow and when you actually read his
[01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:16.520]  letter to the Congress saying he'll veto it he says because it doesn't give him
[01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:22.480]  enough power and because he gets his power from the UN as he said a month
[01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:26.760]  ago in that letter saying that he went to the UN for authority instead of
[01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:33.680]  Congress because it builds the credibility of the United Nations and so
[01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:38.680]  the ACLU is running defense on this telling their leftist followers that a
[01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:43.120]  lot of times do support basic rights who are well-meaning people oh Obama says
[01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:48.320]  no to this bill Obama is already secretly arresting and torturing he's
[01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:55.400]  already launching new wars he's already using UN authority and so Congress
[01:25:55.400 --> 01:26:00.800]  instead of getting mad about Obama almost three months ago now following the
[01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:05.000]  UN order and launching a new war in Libya and not even consulting Congress
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:12.480]  instead they run to him and we played the Ron Paul speech Friday five minute
[01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:15.600]  speech where he said the last nail in the coffin this is the end of the
[01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:19.760]  Republic this allows secret arrest of citizens secret killing of U.S.
[01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:24.320]  citizens in America Bush talked about that Obama's people talked about that
[01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:28.520]  you got cash Sunsteen saying arrest people they disagree with the head
[01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:34.680]  regulations are I mean these are despots and so this is all you need to know
[01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:39.120]  about the mainline Republicans and Democrats in Congress is that they would
[01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:46.640]  go to the president and say here is total power and Obama says I don't want
[01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:53.080]  that I've already got it I don't need you to give me authorization that's like
[01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:57.280]  somebody running up to a tyrant saying master master I've opened the drawbridge
[01:26:57.280 --> 01:27:01.920]  for you everyone's asleep during the city I poisoned the guards bring your
[01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:07.500]  army in and the evil general says I don't need your help scum and stabs the
[01:27:07.500 --> 01:27:13.200]  traitor in the heart by the way historically that's what's done the
[01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:17.320]  groups that open the drawbridge that the groups that give you the secret
[01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:23.280]  passageways under the city you always kill them first because you paid them
[01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:29.920]  100 talons of gold to let you into the city now it's gonna be your city you
[01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:34.720]  don't leave that same backstabber in place to take the next hundred talons
[01:27:34.720 --> 01:27:41.480]  or 200 talons of gold a year or two down the road to let the next tyrant in so
[01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:46.640]  the so the House and Senate runs and the house is the main group that passed
[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:51.440]  this runs to Obama saying you are our Imperial ruler we are here to make the
[01:27:51.440 --> 01:27:56.560]  presidency into absolute dictatorship that's not my opinion that's the
[01:27:56.560 --> 01:27:59.640]  constitutional law scholars that's Ron Paul we've got one of the foremost
[01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:03.800]  scholars coming up in an hour and three minutes from now to break this down and
[01:28:03.800 --> 01:28:08.960]  they said master you are now emperor you are now Caesar you are now tyrannous
[01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:13.640]  the great and Obama says get out of my way and just slaps them I've got the UN
[01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:20.400]  and they just servilely curl up and grovel and yes master yes oh yes oh whatever you
[01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:26.680]  say I mean this is the pathetic bootlicking position that we've been
[01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:31.720]  brought down to in this country given the fact the Obama administration is down
[01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:34.840]  involved in more conflicts and has more troops deployed he just sent even more to
[01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:39.000]  Iraq than any time during the Bush administration how confident should we
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:42.600]  be that a government promise to veto the alarming worldwide war provision
[01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:46.280]  contained in the National Defense Authorization Act will be kept and then
[01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:50.440]  Watson breaks it all down but we do have
[01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:59.440]  Mr. Fine joining us to break this down Bruce Fine coming up later in the
[01:28:59.440 --> 01:29:07.000]  broadcast in other news dealing with the abject tyranny unfolding all over our
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:11.800]  country and all over the world I wanted to break this down ahead of your calls
[01:29:11.800 --> 01:29:19.360]  fireworks shows need new environmental review this is out of the San Diego
[01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:24.720]  Herald Tribune so when San Diego wants to have a fireworks display they've got
[01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:32.400]  to go to a federally licensed priest that's what these new environmental
[01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:37.920]  groups are to get an assessment to say it's okay what type of toilet what type
[01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:42.360]  of house what type of light bulb this is the new control system and of course if
[01:29:42.360 --> 01:29:45.840]  you're an Obama buddy or an insider just like with healthcare you get a waiver
[01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:53.280]  but the point is they admit this is a huge power grab we're on the march the
[01:29:53.280 --> 01:30:02.600]  empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network a very wealthy US

[01:32:10.920 --> 01:32:14.880]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've
[01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:19.560]  turned in this influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[01:32:19.560 --> 01:32:25.080]  calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to
[01:32:25.080 --> 01:32:29.240]  pay attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the
[01:32:29.240 --> 01:32:34.440]  criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[01:32:34.440 --> 01:32:38.480]  constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're
[01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:42.160]  asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to
[01:32:42.160 --> 01:32:47.240]  today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen
[01:32:47.240 --> 01:32:53.320]  a fall of the Republic yet your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info
[01:32:53.320 --> 01:32:58.400]  wars dot com we're watching online right now in super high quality at prison
[01:32:58.400 --> 01:33:07.240]  planet dot TV from the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:20.240]  by the way the crew did find the article from the libertarian site where
[01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:25.360]  the judge ruled that tasers can be used for punishment but you can search it
[01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:28.240]  yourself and find mainstream news articles where in the last few years
[01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:33.800]  they've said that it's basically a form of torture and what will put that
[01:33:33.800 --> 01:33:42.200]  article up on screen for everybody taser torture as summary punishment for
[01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:48.040]  non-compliance by William Greg at the LRC blog the official rationale for
[01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:51.680]  issuing tasers to police officers is that the electroshock devices
[01:33:51.680 --> 01:33:55.400]  representing non-lethal alternative to use of firearm in dealing with
[01:33:55.400 --> 01:33:58.440]  situations that threaten the life or safety of an officer innocent by
[01:33:58.440 --> 01:34:04.480]  standards in particular terms however the taser which is proven to be a lethal
[01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:09.920]  weapon in many cases has become an instrument of pain compliance and again
[01:34:09.920 --> 01:34:15.640]  I have footage unbelievable footage that YouTube even banned and said was too
[01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:20.760]  hardcore of pro-life demonstrators and the federal judge ruling that the police
[01:34:20.760 --> 01:34:25.720]  can break bones and they get them in numchucks and twist to the arm almost
[01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:29.360]  completely twist off and the bone sticks out people are flopping around in pain
[01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:33.080]  cops pull belly clubs once they've broken the arm and come in for a double
[01:34:33.080 --> 01:34:38.720]  serving these are sadomasochistic people in in these videos and the other cops
[01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:43.600]  just stand there while they're doing it and so what was done decades ago to
[01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:47.880]  pro-life versus now come into everybody they're gonna have a system where in the
[01:34:47.880 --> 01:34:50.800]  future if they get away with it where you try to demonstrate they're gonna
[01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:55.080]  break your arm and that's violence that's an attack with a lethal weapon
[01:34:55.080 --> 01:34:58.720]  that's tyranny that's Lexington and Concord when the redcoats came and
[01:34:58.720 --> 01:35:02.720]  started shooting at people and we're trying to fix things peaceable but
[01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:06.720]  but the system does not have a right to brutalize you or attack you and federal
[01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:11.080]  courts have ruled if a cop in the wrong is assaulting you you have a right to
[01:35:11.080 --> 01:35:14.720]  defend yourself the courts have always ruled if a cop doesn't have a warrant
[01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:18.680]  trying to break their way in your house you have a right to defend yourself now
[01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:23.000]  the Indiana Supreme Court says no for any reason including no reason at all
[01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:26.720]  we're coming in your house and the next week one of the lead sheriffs in the
[01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:31.120]  state said we're now gonna start door-to-door gun sweeps and it gets worse
[01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:37.640]  the newspaper speaking of the devil out of Indiana a great publication New
[01:35:37.640 --> 01:35:43.880]  Mexico Supreme Court lets cops grab guns during stops Supreme Court allows
[01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:47.000]  police to take all firearms from all biting motorists during traffic stops
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:52.120]  even if the guns are legal and I see this where people have a gun in their
[01:35:52.120 --> 01:35:55.840]  car and the cops freak out and take them to jail for no reason or you've seen
[01:35:55.840 --> 01:35:59.080]  the cases where people wear guns on their hips at demonstrations to point
[01:35:59.080 --> 01:36:02.360]  out it's legal and cops say I don't care if it's legal just happened last week
[01:36:02.360 --> 01:36:06.160]  and beat the daylights out of you because they're intimidated by you
[01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:10.760]  saying hey you're not the only ones with the right to have force to defend
[01:36:10.760 --> 01:36:17.480]  themselves cops have the power to arrest under the citizen arrest power we
[01:36:17.480 --> 01:36:24.680]  incorporate cities we then empower a security force if we see fit that works
[01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:29.200]  for us that doesn't mean now we can't have guns get that through your heads now
[01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:32.920]  I know a lot of cops understand this because they've demystified guns that
[01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:36.880]  are round guns and they understand the Second Amendment more than the general
[01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:42.800]  public I've seen polls of 98% of cops and national polls being pro-gun but
[01:36:42.800 --> 01:36:47.080]  still the many of these quote liberal cities they see you with the gun they
[01:36:47.080 --> 01:36:51.560]  flip out so we've got to exercise our Second Amendment or lose it just like
[01:36:51.560 --> 01:36:55.400]  we've got to exercise our right to rally and protest and march inside
[01:36:55.400 --> 01:37:00.720]  capitals and get in politicians faces because if we don't next they're gonna
[01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:03.760]  tell us that they're gonna forcibly inoculate our kids that they're gonna
[01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:06.880]  take blood from us at checkpoints that they're gonna put our their hands on
[01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:10.120]  our bodies without warrants that they're gonna come in our houses without
[01:37:10.120 --> 01:37:15.680]  warrants because that's what always happens throughout history 100% of the
[01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:22.600]  time we know what happens in the affairs of men and women
[01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:33.200]  now Dewhurst is feeling massive heat right now massive massive heat right
[01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:38.840]  now and we're gonna get this article up on info wars.com and prisonplanet.com
[01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:43.720]  Rob do you get this from the Lone Star report up as fast as you can get
[01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:48.440]  Kurt to or have Matt do it Dewhurst writes Perry to request anti-groping bill
[01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:53.360]  congressional redistricting on special session call Dewhurst has gotten such
[01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:58.000]  incredible heat after he was exposed by Senator Patrick and others for going
[01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:03.320]  around killing the bill last Wednesday that he is now under the heat going to
[01:38:03.320 --> 01:38:08.960]  Perry asking him to add the bill in with the special session so we're now
[01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:14.640]  forcing them notice Perry announced a new special session today but didn't put
[01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:18.960]  in there the anti-groping bill showing that he was never really for it but your
[01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:26.120]  phone calls are having an effect this just came out so very very exciting news
[01:38:26.120 --> 01:38:33.520]  we're gonna get that up on info wars.com and prisonplanet.com the fact is the
[01:38:33.520 --> 01:38:37.880]  heat that you've been putting on them last week this week is just having a
[01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:41.720]  huge effect so great job I'm gonna break that down more in the next hour and give
[01:38:41.720 --> 01:38:45.200]  the number out to Rick Perry again but I promise to go to your phone calls just
[01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:52.320]  finishing up though with agenda 21 agenda 21 is UN laws lobbied by the
[01:38:52.320 --> 01:39:00.840]  central governments under treaty and then they lobby the states or regions and
[01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:05.760]  under agenda 21 that's how you get unified global standardization of spying
[01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:10.400]  devices and cameras and and and phones and computers it's how you get unified
[01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:17.720]  banning of phosphorescent light bulbs and the mandatory fluorescent that's how
[01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:22.120]  you get global standardization to ban first indoor smoking then outdoor
[01:39:22.120 --> 01:39:26.000]  smoking that's how you get standardization of toilets it's how you
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:29.840]  get standardization of federal zoning for home inspections it's how you get
[01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:37.480]  global standardization for carbon taxes it's all open UN Rio de Janeiro 1992
[01:39:37.480 --> 01:39:42.840]  morey strong openly stating a post-industrial world where to have any
[01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:49.160]  job or any business or any farm any ranch to build a farm to build a bridge
[01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:54.320]  to build a walkway to build a barn to have chickens you've got to get
[01:39:54.320 --> 01:40:00.320]  government approval you can't demand the approval they decide just like
[01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:05.200]  thousands of companies get waivers from Obama on health care this is fascism
[01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:10.000]  dressed up as liberal socialism in my historical experience socialism doesn't
[01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:17.040]  exist it's a magical fake made-up utopian idea fascism does and usually it
[01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:20.840]  calls itself socialist Hitler called himself a national socialist
[01:40:20.840 --> 01:40:26.160]  Mussolini was first a socialist then changed it to a fascist and it's a
[01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:31.200]  select group grabbing government to then take your tax money and pay it as
[01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:36.160]  corporate welfare to mega corporations who then are the only ones allowed to
[01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:41.280]  operate so fireworks show needs new environmental review what started as a
[01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:45.120]  battle over fireworks show led to a sweeping legal victory Friday for
[01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:48.720]  environmentalist they're just tyrants under a new name they're goody two
[01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:53.040]  shoes oh I'm a tyrant but I'm liberal so it's okay that could stymie a wide
[01:40:53.040 --> 01:40:58.480]  range of events needing city permits from rock and roll marathon they say it's
[01:40:58.480 --> 01:41:02.480]  bad for humans to be walking around to birthday parties held at parks oh yeah
[01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:07.040]  they're ruling that the Amish are being shut down everywhere because dust comes
[01:41:07.040 --> 01:41:10.280]  up when they till the soil but it's only being enforced on them the idea that
[01:41:10.280 --> 01:41:15.440]  dust is illegal according to the strictest interpretations of this jumpy
[01:41:15.440 --> 01:41:18.600]  jumps and everything else would be subject to environmental review
[01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:23.200]  including birthday parties at city parks if this ruling stands said lawyer
[01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:27.880]  Robert Howard who represents the La Joya Community Fireworks Foundation in the
[01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:32.400]  case it's a breathtaking ruling they've got to go pay and if you go to the
[01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:35.560]  universities it's one of the biggest groups are these environmental
[01:41:35.560 --> 01:41:39.320]  assessment groups and they follow the federal regulations and then you got to
[01:41:39.320 --> 01:41:44.160]  pay them a special assessment for them to come wave a magic wand and save you
[01:41:44.160 --> 01:41:50.200]  can have fireworks superior court judge Linda Quinn said the La Joya's annual
[01:41:50.200 --> 01:41:57.760]  fourth of July fireworks show requires a valuation do what La Joya annual
[01:41:57.760 --> 01:42:04.040]  fourth of July fireworks show requires a valuation so if La Joya wants an annual
[01:42:04.040 --> 01:42:07.960]  fourth of July fireworks show requires an evaluation of the California
[01:42:07.960 --> 01:42:13.040]  Environmental Quality Act the cage filed by the Coastal Environmental Rights
[01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:19.000]  Foundation targeted San Diego's approval of La Joya event by eventually drew in a
[01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:25.160]  broad swath of city permits and they're now going to say you've got to have a
[01:42:25.160 --> 01:42:29.000]  permit for a party anything anywhere that's public you can read the whole
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:35.160]  nightmare article if you want so this is the new environmental cult that you've
[01:42:35.160 --> 01:42:38.880]  got to go to the priest and then they come out in the session if you kiss their
[01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:43.560]  hind end pay him enough money maybe then you can have an event but but wait
[01:42:43.560 --> 01:42:51.400]  there's more here's another one out of the Christian post and it goes on church
[01:42:51.400 --> 01:42:56.880]  lands $4,000 fine for excessive tree pruning a church in shard North
[01:42:56.880 --> 01:43:01.000]  Carolina has been hit by $4,000 fine for breaking the city's tree trimming
[01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:06.600]  regulations city officials slapped the Presbyterian church with a hundred
[01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:11.800]  dollar per branch for excessive pruning its crepe myrtles which is a tree
[01:43:11.800 --> 01:43:16.280]  brought in the Charlotte Observer reports the trees are cut back by the
[01:43:16.280 --> 01:43:19.240]  church member and you cut them back so they grow back better the next year I've
[01:43:19.240 --> 01:43:22.920]  got some crepe myrtles every two to three years but this is the first time
[01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:27.680]  the church has been fined for violating the city's tree ordinance and it just
[01:43:27.680 --> 01:43:32.280]  goes on but the ordinance has been in place in 78 but it's now being enforced
[01:43:32.280 --> 01:43:37.280]  across the board so you don't trim anything without getting them out there
[01:43:37.280 --> 01:43:41.160]  by the way they use environmental rules all over the country and in Europe to
[01:43:41.160 --> 01:43:47.880]  not let you get the permit to put in your own solar on your house they'll only
[01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:53.200]  give you the permit if you wire it in to government if you wired into the major
[01:43:53.200 --> 01:43:58.320]  power grid and then get your power back from them the mafia is okay with you but
[01:43:58.320 --> 01:44:01.520]  all over the country they have code inspectors driving around even
[01:44:01.520 --> 01:44:07.800]  retroactively looking for windmills looking for turbines looking for solar
[01:44:07.800 --> 01:44:13.160]  grids and boy they pull into your house they say did you know you had to get a
[01:44:13.160 --> 01:44:16.520]  permit for that a lot of times people in the news say well yeah you wouldn't come
[01:44:16.520 --> 01:44:20.320]  out for a year and give me a permit and they go that's right now we're gonna find
[01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:26.240]  you hundreds if not thousands here in Austin it's $2,000 a day for three inch
[01:44:26.240 --> 01:44:31.440]  grass we've documented that for until that you you take that down and then you
[01:44:31.440 --> 01:44:36.960]  beg and you wait for me and maybe I'll come out and give you authorization to
[01:44:36.960 --> 01:44:44.360]  have those solar panels oh my gosh you know what I mean it's just when does
[01:44:44.360 --> 01:44:48.600]  this nightmare end when do we get these people off of our back when does it
[01:44:48.600 --> 01:44:54.040]  stop meanwhile the crooks in government can steal $27 trillion they can
[01:44:54.040 --> 01:44:57.920]  engage in any crime they want they can have Dinecore and Halliburton running

[01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:30.640]  you're going into a big church they pull up and they march you onto these
[01:45:30.640 --> 01:45:36.040]  trucks and then their quack computer says that you are putting off brainwaves
[01:45:36.040 --> 01:45:40.960]  or facial expressions that are evil and here's the article big sis pre-crime

[01:47:09.240 --> 01:47:13.960]  had one final question two weeks ago Bill O'Reilly was talking about I'm a
[01:47:13.960 --> 01:47:18.120]  dinner job I'm a dinner job was over there complaining that Europe and some
[01:47:18.120 --> 01:47:22.040]  other choice countries over there were draining the clouds before you know to
[01:47:22.040 --> 01:47:27.080]  cause drought in that area and they just laughed at them you know I was curious
[01:47:27.080 --> 01:47:31.640]  if you heard about that or yeah I did see a minute she'd say that Dubai and
[01:47:31.640 --> 01:47:35.320]  other countries have put up the big antenna arrays like harp they admit it's
[01:47:35.320 --> 01:47:38.960]  for weather modification their neighbors are getting mad saying that when the
[01:47:38.960 --> 01:47:43.880]  clouds come over they ionize them cause the water particulates to congeal and
[01:47:43.880 --> 01:47:49.760]  then rain on them and a lot of there's a actual anti-weather modification treaty
[01:47:49.760 --> 01:47:59.680]  passed in 77 and signed on to at the UN level by our government so I don't know
[01:47:59.680 --> 01:48:03.160]  why they joke and laugh about it the first speech the White House science
[01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:07.160]  are gave two years ago and when he got into position was about weather
[01:48:07.160 --> 01:48:11.640]  modification and so yes there is weather warfare going on Secretary of Defense
[01:48:11.640 --> 01:48:18.800]  William Cohen April 28th 2000 April 28th 1997 gave a speech it was in Army
[01:48:18.800 --> 01:48:21.960]  Times admitting they have the weather weapons I appreciate your call great
[01:48:21.960 --> 01:48:26.480]  points Justin but you're not supposed to talk about it let's talk to John in
[01:48:26.480 --> 01:48:30.200]  Texas John you're on the air go ahead hi Alex
[01:48:30.200 --> 01:48:35.520]  hey buddy hey I wanted to thank you thank you for wars for for Lincoln me under
[01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:39.600]  that excellent documentary novel or else the Clorum the slaughterhouse of
[01:48:39.600 --> 01:48:44.600]  Osiris it was a documentary documenting how the the Illuminati
[01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:48.560]  Freemasons and Wall Street bankers funded the Communists and sent them into
[01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:53.120]  Russia and all the whores that went on there and the fact that they when they
[01:48:53.120 --> 01:48:56.960]  sent them in there that was to be used as a launching ground for world government
[01:48:56.960 --> 01:49:01.800]  absolutely it's on record that our government and the British government
[01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:05.960]  funded the Bolsheviks at its public record Anthony Sutton got the
[01:49:05.960 --> 01:49:11.000]  congressional documents back in the 70s and 80s and wrote several books on the
[01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:16.240]  financing of Hitler the financing of the Communists before that and look at what
[01:49:16.240 --> 01:49:19.840]  our government setting up now I mean every time our criminal illegitimate
[01:49:19.840 --> 01:49:23.840]  government has a chance what do they put in in other countries they don't put
[01:49:23.840 --> 01:49:28.440]  republics in they don't put democracies in they put tyrants in they want
[01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:34.760]  tyrants worldwide so they want tyrants here they're building a global Soviet
[01:49:34.760 --> 01:49:38.960]  system and this should be waking up anybody the fact that they took our
[01:49:38.960 --> 01:49:43.000]  manufacturing base the jobs to support the middle class and give it to an evil
[01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:46.400]  communist police state that should be signs right there what they got coming
[01:49:46.400 --> 01:49:51.200]  down the road for they gave them tax incentives for more than 25 years to move
[01:49:51.200 --> 01:49:57.400]  to China Mexico and other places it's it's it's unbelievable it's all
[01:49:57.400 --> 01:50:01.920]  premeditated and now they're putting every regulation they can in to shut
[01:50:01.920 --> 01:50:07.040]  down what's left of our industry while China India Mexico and 160 plus other
[01:50:07.040 --> 01:50:12.680]  countries have to make zero carbon cuts China builds three to four new coal
[01:50:12.680 --> 01:50:18.120]  power plants a week we get no more than two or three a year and Obama's
[01:50:18.120 --> 01:50:22.880]  energies are the head of the Department of Energy announced two months ago that
[01:50:22.880 --> 01:50:27.760]  they are gonna quote shut down quote massive amounts of coal plants but not
[01:50:27.760 --> 01:50:31.880]  general electric the day their new regulations not law Congress wouldn't
[01:50:31.880 --> 01:50:37.000]  pass it so Obama just said it's a regulation guess who got the waiver who
[01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:40.560]  gets to build new ones and who doesn't have to upkeep and upgrade them general
[01:50:40.560 --> 01:50:44.800]  electric just like McDonald's doesn't have to get their employees insurance
[01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:48.640]  that stuff goes in at the end of the year for everybody else it's gonna
[01:50:48.640 --> 01:50:53.800]  devastate the economy but that's good that shuts us down and then only general
[01:50:53.800 --> 01:50:59.240]  electric and Walmart we get prisons Walmart's military bases that's the new

[01:54:02.040 --> 01:54:28.680]  I was brainstorming this morning and it's really simple humans behave the same
[01:54:28.680 --> 01:54:34.680]  act the same throughout history we just have more technology now and that gives
[01:54:34.680 --> 01:54:38.280]  an advantage to individuals that want to expose corruption it also gives an
[01:54:38.280 --> 01:54:43.680]  advantage to those that are corrupt and the system can hide in the complexity
[01:54:43.680 --> 01:54:48.360]  that's why the bureaucrats always want to make things more and more complex to
[01:54:48.360 --> 01:54:56.520]  hide the corruption the insider deals but now they've gotten so arrogant so
[01:54:56.520 --> 01:55:02.720]  hubris filled so much hutzpah bravada a plum whatever word you want to use for it
[01:55:02.720 --> 01:55:07.680]  that Obama's now issued thousands of waivers to giant companies and personal
[01:55:07.680 --> 01:55:11.040]  friends and I'll have to get insurance for their employees do you realize the
[01:55:11.040 --> 01:55:16.360]  magnitude of that I mean that's magnitude that is incredible general
[01:55:16.360 --> 01:55:20.280]  electric can build new plants and not upgrade them but they've got a three
[01:55:20.280 --> 01:55:24.000]  billion dollar plant in Corpus Christi that's modern and they won't let them
[01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:29.040]  turn the new coal plant on because they're not part of the insider crew I
[01:55:29.040 --> 01:55:35.880]  mean this is criminal and all over the country oh of $4,000 fine look at the
[01:55:35.880 --> 01:55:42.320]  exact amount yeah $4,000 fine because you trimmed the crepe myrtles even if you

[01:55:45.720 --> 01:55:55.520]  or they die you're supposed to trim rosebushes moron oh I'm just sick of it
[01:55:55.520 --> 01:55:59.680]  I'm just so sick of it I mean these control freaks are everywhere and
[01:55:59.680 --> 01:56:04.000]  everything they pass the laws they pass what they put in place I saw a report
[01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:08.360]  just six months ago National Australian TV half the land in Australia has been
[01:56:08.360 --> 01:56:13.720]  laid off use just randomly half of whatever land you own for farming is
[01:56:13.720 --> 01:56:18.080]  off limits some people have had stuff for over a hundred years sheep farms they
[01:56:18.080 --> 01:56:22.560]  say you now can't use half of it that's how we're gonna pass our carbon credit
[01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:27.200]  level for the UN and then they and I've got a caller here Sean in Australia I'm
[01:56:27.200 --> 01:56:31.600]  gonna go to him in a moment I want to ask what's happened with that fight the

[01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:40.440]  destroyed I mean just arbitrarily you can't use half your land now because the
[01:56:40.440 --> 01:56:48.680]  flatulence of your sheep or your cows or you I mean just period it's tyranny

[01:58:53.840 --> 01:58:58.280]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[01:58:58.280 --> 01:59:02.320]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[01:59:02.320 --> 01:59:06.200]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[01:59:06.200 --> 01:59:10.200]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[01:59:10.200 --> 01:59:14.760]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[01:59:14.760 --> 01:59:18.760]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[01:59:18.760 --> 01:59:22.600]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[01:59:22.600 --> 01:59:26.200]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[01:59:26.200 --> 01:59:30.560]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[01:59:30.560 --> 01:59:33.680]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power

[01:59:47.720 --> 02:00:01.400]  1-877-327-0365. Waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[02:00:05.360 --> 02:00:13.200]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[02:00:13.200 --> 02:00:20.720]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:20.720 --> 02:00:29.040]  Alex Jones we are now into our number three constitutional law expert the
[02:00:29.040 --> 02:00:33.600]  man Ron Paul calls the expert Bruce Thion will be joining us to get into the
[02:00:33.600 --> 02:00:37.920]  unbelievable presidential power grab Congress is trying to hand Obama for
[02:00:37.920 --> 02:00:43.120]  perpetual war torture secret arrest and murder of even US citizens CDC
[02:00:43.120 --> 02:00:47.920]  admits flu vaccines don't work big news on that front also CNN reporting that
[02:00:47.920 --> 02:00:51.400]  the World Health Organization is having to admit that yes cell phones are giving
[02:00:51.400 --> 02:00:55.320]  you brain cancer folks we've all gotten addicted to them we've got to use
[02:00:55.320 --> 02:00:59.080]  hands-free that way just gives our kneecap you know we're sitting beside
[02:00:59.080 --> 02:01:03.160]  us in the car cancer we've got to stop putting them up to our heads we got to
[02:01:03.160 --> 02:01:07.480]  use the Bluetooth there's just the radio wave wireless isn't that bad the
[02:01:07.480 --> 02:01:12.840]  study show it's that microwave it's a microwave relay pulse system it's a
[02:01:12.840 --> 02:01:19.760]  very powerful but it's just like putting water putting poison in a water tank
[02:01:19.760 --> 02:01:26.000]  cows deer sheep they'll come up and drink because it's odorless it's
[02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:29.640]  tasteless and they'll watch other sheep around them dying and they'll still come
[02:01:29.640 --> 02:01:34.560]  and drink right next to a dead sheep in the mud and I'm the same way been using
[02:01:34.560 --> 02:01:40.440]  cell phones for a long time since college I got one I use them I don't talk a lot
[02:01:40.440 --> 02:01:46.840]  on them I don't talk for long periods on them like my dad my dad is glued to his
[02:01:46.840 --> 02:01:51.720]  talking to his patients and people and doing prescriptions and my poor dad he
[02:01:51.720 --> 02:01:55.640]  just lives on it with a microwave relay tower right up against his head and he
[02:01:55.640 --> 02:02:00.200]  will he needs to stop it you can't hung out with him in barbecued yesterday and
[02:02:00.200 --> 02:02:03.840]  he was creeping off on that cell phone I said I got landlines right here but I
[02:02:03.840 --> 02:02:06.640]  know they're little computers they got all the numbers for you they got the
[02:02:06.640 --> 02:02:11.840]  messages they got it all stored it makes it and it also surveils you I got to do
[02:02:11.840 --> 02:02:16.920]  something I think I may just get rid of the cell phone but then when I'm on
[02:02:16.920 --> 02:02:22.040]  trips and things they don't even have pay phones anymore see they they make
[02:02:22.040 --> 02:02:27.480]  killing yourself so easy they make being surveilled so easy I don't even plug a
[02:02:27.480 --> 02:02:33.280]  hands-free into it my buddy Jimmy Von does he and his wife and friends with
[02:02:33.280 --> 02:02:36.440]  them great folks notice they've got those plug-in phones so it's at least a
[02:02:36.440 --> 02:02:40.320]  way from you it's like a regular phone but see I won't do that I'll talk the
[02:02:40.320 --> 02:02:45.760]  talk but I won't walk the walk I'm pathetic we're going to shot in
[02:02:45.760 --> 02:02:49.000]  Australia next but first let's go to David Maryland Dave you're on the air go
[02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:54.560]  ahead yeah that's Alex thanks for letting me come on hey I've got a little bit
[02:02:54.560 --> 02:02:57.400]  of information here I wanted to pass on to you I'll take a couple minutes I've
[02:02:57.400 --> 02:03:03.040]  done my homework on some of these right to carry gun laws are you there yes sir
[02:03:03.040 --> 02:03:07.520]  yes and I found out something I've been talking to the Department of Natural
[02:03:07.520 --> 02:03:12.080]  Resources the state police in Maryland and West Virginia and they confirmed
[02:03:12.080 --> 02:03:16.520]  what I already knew it's about black powder type weapons like flit locks
[02:03:16.520 --> 02:03:21.440]  muzzle loaders percussion muzzle loaders and captain ball pistols they don't fall
[02:03:21.440 --> 02:03:27.880]  under the 1933 or the 68 gun control act therefore you can strap a captain ball
[02:03:27.880 --> 02:03:32.800]  pistol on your person or where it concealed and walk anywhere you want by
[02:03:32.800 --> 02:03:40.560]  the way a 44 or a 357 black powder six-shooter I mean you can load those
[02:03:40.560 --> 02:03:44.840]  baby up you could they are they are almost as deadly as a regular white
[02:03:44.840 --> 02:03:52.920]  powder they are incredible firearms you can also buy them without the next check
[02:03:52.920 --> 02:03:56.880]  right and there's not a dang thing they can do about it if you want to strap
[02:03:56.880 --> 02:04:00.600]  roll and carry it so I propose that everybody go out and either get a
[02:04:00.600 --> 02:04:06.400]  36 or a 44 caliber learn how to load it utilize it how to shoot it and wear it
[02:04:06.400 --> 02:04:10.400]  this will break those people from sucking eggs well there's nothing more
[02:04:10.400 --> 02:04:14.160]  powerful than demonstrating even though they say we can't there's nothing more
[02:04:14.160 --> 02:04:18.440]  powerful than wearing guns openly and that totally freaks Chris Matthews out
[02:04:18.440 --> 02:04:21.240]  because if they're having to show rallies with people wearing guns everywhere
[02:04:21.240 --> 02:04:26.560]  then the general public goes well wait how's that legal the drama I watch the
[02:04:26.560 --> 02:04:30.360]  cop show I watch the fiction I watch shows people being arrested every
[02:04:30.360 --> 02:04:34.320]  episode for owning a gun in their house see they create the perception it's
[02:04:34.320 --> 02:04:39.520]  illegal so they can then ban it do you see what's going on you like punch a
[02:04:39.520 --> 02:04:44.400]  vea wear it outside on us so the whole world can see it and be proud I love
[02:04:44.400 --> 02:04:48.400]  that Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard song well do you want us to play that

[02:09:42.040 --> 02:09:47.360]  nail in the republic's coffin that's how ron paul put it last week total
[02:09:47.360 --> 02:09:52.080]  dictator powers the congress is trying to give the office of the presidency
[02:09:52.080 --> 02:09:58.000]  unbelievable but it's happening shan in australia you're on the air thanks for
[02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:16.200]  holding well we're dominating the fight against the globalist because there's
[02:10:16.200 --> 02:10:21.400]  red-blooded humans worldwide who have a passion for liberty beating in their
[02:10:21.400 --> 02:10:27.720]  heart and nothing will quench it but freedom I great well look I was
[02:10:27.720 --> 02:10:33.720]  unaware of your issue that you brought up without the farmland being taken away
[02:10:33.720 --> 02:10:38.640]  um well to me it's clearly an unmitigated power grab supported by a
[02:10:38.640 --> 02:10:43.640]  nonsensical theory and I reiterate anthropogenic global warming is a
[02:10:43.640 --> 02:10:48.560]  theory I'm a geophysicist and I'll say on record that anthropogenic global
[02:10:48.560 --> 02:10:53.680]  warming is a cure hoax but wait the UN says two years ago at Copenhagen that
[02:10:53.680 --> 02:10:58.040]  the sun has no effect on climate so they waved a magic wand just like they say
[02:10:58.040 --> 02:11:02.840]  levels hundreds of times safe levels are now safe at Fukushima they wave a
[02:11:02.840 --> 02:11:08.400]  magic wand they say it's caused by cows flatulence and so now we've got to put
[02:11:08.400 --> 02:11:31.440]  the tax on your cows that's right half the farmland announced last year to be
[02:11:31.440 --> 02:11:36.320]  off limits for people that currently own it or using it where is that fight
[02:11:36.320 --> 02:11:49.480]  going right now in Australia that's all over Australian news just search it's
[02:11:49.480 --> 02:11:54.000]  even sky television with the reports the best way to find it is farmer on hunger
[02:11:54.000 --> 02:12:01.040]  strike in Australia and that should bring it up for you okay okay well check
[02:12:01.040 --> 02:12:06.200]  that out yeah I struggled to watch the mainstream news and why I can't handle
[02:12:06.200 --> 02:12:09.440]  I know it's painful to watch him but you got to watch the enemy you got to know
[02:12:09.440 --> 02:12:13.280]  what they're up to yeah you don't you don't this is what I've called it look
[02:12:13.280 --> 02:12:18.440]  it's obviously my first time in I want to be quick but I need to carefully frame
[02:12:18.440 --> 02:12:23.360]  points that I don't like I've called him to give you a breakdown of how I see the
[02:12:23.360 --> 02:12:28.680]  events ensuring in terms of our level of potential intervention first I've got to
[02:12:28.680 --> 02:12:32.200]  command the New Hampshire lawyer representing the 9-11 victims families
[02:12:32.200 --> 02:12:36.600]  who recently called into the show and directed us to his phone calls trans
[02:12:36.600 --> 02:12:41.400]  script with the senior investigator of the New York District Attorney Cyrus
[02:12:41.400 --> 02:12:45.680]  Vance Jr. the guy's pretty impressive he wasn't going to back down and his
[02:12:45.680 --> 02:12:50.320]  control of the conversation was very good look it's obvious why called into the
[02:12:50.320 --> 02:12:54.880]  DA's office and why called into the show the talents it was directly related to
[02:12:54.880 --> 02:13:00.420]  what Dr. Pachennick said on your show on the 4th of May now my breakdown of the
[02:13:00.420 --> 02:13:04.240]  ensuring event trying to follow what you're hold on trying to follow I vaguely
[02:13:04.240 --> 02:13:11.920]  remember a caller pointing out that Cyrus Vance Jr. who who Pachennick had
[02:13:11.920 --> 02:13:16.280]  actually worked for his dad when he was Secretary of State so so I see that tie
[02:13:16.280 --> 02:13:20.960]  in and I mentioned that here on the show that the caller was saying he called
[02:13:20.960 --> 02:13:25.400]  Cyrus Vance Jr. I believe he said and that they're ready to talk to Pachennick
[02:13:25.400 --> 02:13:29.120]  and so Pachennick said they know where to get me that they should contact him if
[02:13:29.120 --> 02:13:35.000]  they're serious and is that what you're talking about correct he called into the
[02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:39.200]  DA's office look I've got a different approach I'm seeing it from a different
[02:13:39.200 --> 02:13:45.120]  angle okay now first I have to say that I'm logically operating the context of
[02:13:45.120 --> 02:13:50.640]  the comprehensive meaning that people like yourself and Dr. Tarpley have
[02:13:50.640 --> 02:13:55.520]  laid out for us which is the model of total tyranny the model of incremental
[02:13:55.520 --> 02:14:00.560]  degradation of humanity population control the bankers debt colonialism
[02:14:00.560 --> 02:14:05.640]  imperialism and absolute insider corruption which is so to us as a
[02:14:05.640 --> 02:14:10.760]  style that claims that this model is classical capitalism and that the
[02:14:10.760 --> 02:14:14.760]  problems are due to the free market which is the reverse that's right this
[02:14:14.760 --> 02:14:19.120]  is not a free market system this is a crony insider mafia system then they
[02:14:19.120 --> 02:14:23.560]  blame all their crimes on capitalism and sell socialism as a solution when
[02:14:23.560 --> 02:14:26.960]  that's exactly what they want is to communalize our wealth so they can
[02:14:26.960 --> 02:14:31.960]  steal it at a one-pot correct yeah I totally agree it's global
[02:14:31.960 --> 02:14:37.840]  corporatism now with this medal you can clearly see the continuity of government
[02:14:37.840 --> 02:14:42.960]  across the NATO and new-owned countries as self-evident just as it is self
[02:14:42.960 --> 02:14:47.640]  evident that there is a false two-party paradigm a ceremonial Congress and a
[02:14:47.640 --> 02:14:52.400]  pre-selected puppet president now we've got this in Australia as well no doubt so
[02:14:52.400 --> 02:14:56.600]  one of the consequences of this very serious phone call after what Dr.
[02:14:56.600 --> 02:15:01.680]  Pachennick has told us and for those of us who see reality according to this
[02:15:01.680 --> 02:15:06.920]  model we have to understand that the 9-11 narrative is a Psyop and that the
[02:15:06.920 --> 02:15:12.560]  behind-the-scenes intelligence defense and Psyop think tanks need to be able to
[02:15:12.560 --> 02:15:18.120]  handle a transition from a current Psyop paradigm and the war on terror to a new
[02:15:18.120 --> 02:15:23.440]  narrative so obviously the current Psyop is the false flag terror that was
[02:15:23.440 --> 02:15:29.200]  deployed in us on 2001 so a new narrative must be controlled and must
[02:15:29.200 --> 02:15:33.720]  maintain at least some level of narrative continuity so the power of it
[02:15:33.720 --> 02:15:37.360]  did not lose total control of the masses sure it sounds like you're reading
[02:15:37.360 --> 02:15:42.000]  I'm almost out of time I've got to get to other callers Sean bring it to a head
[02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:50.520]  for us okay so what I start what I'm saying is that if the organization
[02:15:50.520 --> 02:15:55.680]  between the DA Dr. Pachennick and everyone comes to head the prosecution I
[02:15:55.680 --> 02:16:01.960]  believe will only go ahead if the power elite are ready to make a transition
[02:16:01.960 --> 02:16:07.200]  from the current Psyop to a new Psyop because they work on a timetable now
[02:16:07.200 --> 02:16:11.240]  that time table you know yeah I don't believe the globalist want 9-11 truth
[02:16:11.240 --> 02:16:15.360]  to come out they they're there they're still using that paradigm they're still
[02:16:15.360 --> 02:16:18.680]  moving forward with it and that would that would discredit their entire system
[02:16:18.680 --> 02:16:22.040]  if that ever happened Sean sounds like you've got a lot of thoughts write an
[02:16:22.040 --> 02:16:26.280]  article up send it to us if it's good stuff we'll publish it at info wars.com
[02:16:26.280 --> 02:16:29.960]  or put it on your own blog sounds interesting Eric in Texas Eric you're
[02:16:29.960 --> 02:16:37.680]  on the air oh man yes there yep sure I'm sure I've been a soldier the New
[02:16:37.680 --> 02:16:42.720]  World Order since 96 man so I went to the police academy there and Central
[02:16:42.720 --> 02:16:47.640]  Texas yes and you listen to you on AEM but you're quack till a few years back
[02:16:47.640 --> 02:16:51.000]  we had an emergency preparedness class that we took we had a bunch of big
[02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:55.440]  weeks from Gulfport in Orleans come in talking about FEMA and Katrina and we
[02:16:55.440 --> 02:16:58.720]  got to see the National ID card that no one else is supposed to know about
[02:16:58.720 --> 02:17:04.840]  because I'll think it's the end of the beginning of the end I suppose just
[02:17:04.840 --> 02:17:08.960]  wanted to kind of say thanks for waking me up and I chose to be a cop and I've
[02:17:08.960 --> 02:17:13.080]  seen enough stuff over the years where I've decided not to be joined Oath Keepers
[02:17:13.080 --> 02:17:17.920]  couple years ago and and pretty much a traitor in an outcast with my peers and
[02:17:17.920 --> 02:17:22.720]  co-workers since then and it's really for saying you for saying you're gonna
[02:17:22.720 --> 02:17:26.320]  follow the Bill of Rights and Constitution you're a traitor in an
[02:17:26.320 --> 02:17:31.360]  outcast you know what stay there don't hang up we've got to go to break here
[02:17:31.360 --> 02:17:37.120]  Eric I want to come back after this break and talk about how you're a traitor
[02:17:37.120 --> 02:17:40.320]  in an outcast because you say you'll follow the Bill of Rights and
[02:17:40.320 --> 02:17:46.320]  Constitution you'll do what you've sworn to do you will stand for the Republic I
[02:17:46.320 --> 02:17:50.560]  mean that is a frightening statement and so I want to hear some details of
[02:17:50.560 --> 02:17:55.480]  that but I want to go out to break with a few minutes of this erin tippet
[02:17:55.480 --> 02:17:59.000]  country song you've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything
[02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:04.680]  this man says that he stands for the Bill of Rights and Constitution these
[02:18:04.680 --> 02:18:13.600]  guys that think it's so evil and so bad what do they stand for here it is
[02:18:13.600 --> 02:18:34.280]  now daddy didn't like trouble if it came along everyone that knew him knew
[02:18:34.280 --> 02:18:43.040]  it's like to keep me on he never was a hero or this county's shining like but
[02:18:43.040 --> 02:18:50.400]  you could always find you've standing up what he thought was right he'd say you've
[02:18:50.400 --> 02:18:57.720]  got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything you've got to be your own
[02:18:57.720 --> 02:19:06.800]  man got a puppet on the screen never compromise what's right and I pull your
[02:19:06.800 --> 02:19:15.680]  family name you've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything
[02:19:19.880 --> 02:19:28.280]  now we might have been better off our own bigger house if daddy done more
[02:19:28.280 --> 02:19:35.760]  giving in or a little more backing down but we always had plenty just to live
[02:19:35.760 --> 02:19:45.400]  in his advice whatever you do today you have to sleep with tonight it's a you
[02:19:45.400 --> 02:19:51.360]  got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything what does this republic
[02:19:51.360 --> 02:19:57.120]  stand for what do the police stand for if they're so scared of the Bill of Rights

[02:20:02.440 --> 02:20:06.400]  Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds

[02:24:07.880 --> 02:24:12.640]  because there's a war on for your mind
[02:24:13.520 --> 02:24:19.040]  okay so Eric is a police officer here in Texas says he's gonna get out of it
[02:24:19.040 --> 02:24:23.040]  because he became a member of Oathkeepers a few years ago and talks
[02:24:23.040 --> 02:24:27.160]  about liberty and freedom and he's becoming outcast now I get calls like
[02:24:27.160 --> 02:24:30.720]  this I talked to cops on the street you know that pull up on their bikes or in
[02:24:30.720 --> 02:24:36.320]  their squad cars and we're routinely both of them are listeners so I guess it
[02:24:36.320 --> 02:24:40.880]  depends in what department you're in or what unit or what group but generally
[02:24:40.880 --> 02:24:46.000]  they're trying to turn cops into enemies of the Republic but a lot of police
[02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:50.080]  that I've run into are good men and women but that is really scary Eric
[02:24:50.080 --> 02:24:54.160]  because I have squad car video not just in my film Road to Terranie but in other
[02:24:54.160 --> 02:24:58.280]  clips I've been sent where it's their own video with their own microphones on
[02:24:58.280 --> 02:25:03.040]  their ties or on their uniforms where they find a pocket Constitution or
[02:25:03.040 --> 02:25:07.300]  somebody brings up the Constitution and the cops act like they found a dead
[02:25:07.300 --> 02:25:11.200]  baby or something that I mean act like they found meth dealers I mean they
[02:25:11.200 --> 02:25:15.960]  freak out in fear and so I guess that same brainwashing that they're given
[02:25:15.960 --> 02:25:21.080]  the police I guess extends to you don't they know that keeping your oath is what
[02:25:21.080 --> 02:25:26.040]  they've sworn to I mean how can so many police think that talking about keeping
[02:25:26.040 --> 02:25:32.360]  your oath is dirty well I get it's just a culture of us versus them man it's been
[02:25:32.360 --> 02:25:36.080]  that way since I went through the Academy you know there's there's a lot of
[02:25:36.080 --> 02:25:41.520]  lip service on civil rights and and people's private property and really
[02:25:41.520 --> 02:25:45.440]  boils down to just a bunch of CIA information to keep the departments
[02:25:45.440 --> 02:25:49.880]  getting sued and unless you get in you know unless you get into a specialized
[02:25:49.880 --> 02:25:55.080]  unit or you start dealing more with the guys that are in charge most of the
[02:25:55.080 --> 02:25:58.040]  stuff they're involved in I think it's kind of out of our pay grade on the
[02:25:58.040 --> 02:26:03.000]  street when I saw these knuckleheads from post Katrina coming there with this
[02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:07.560]  emergency preparedness and joking about the National ID card and number of the
[02:26:07.560 --> 02:26:11.800]  beast and I'm not super religious guy but I mean it it struck me as like wait
[02:26:11.800 --> 02:26:16.760]  a minute you know what what is the National ID card for and they proceeded
[02:26:16.760 --> 02:26:21.600]  to tell me that you know to restrict access in and out of emergency zones and
[02:26:21.600 --> 02:26:27.160]  it was ridiculous and I kind of was vocal about it at the class and that's
[02:26:27.160 --> 02:26:29.920]  kind of where it started for me because I noticed the guys looking around like
[02:26:29.920 --> 02:26:34.600]  I was some kind of a you know fruit cake or right winger or something and sir
[02:26:34.600 --> 02:26:38.720]  have you seen road to tyranny because I have stuff pre-911 it was sent to us in
[02:26:38.720 --> 02:26:43.920]  2000 by firefighter it's in Kansas City where I was on the still on AM radio and
[02:26:43.920 --> 02:26:48.280]  the rooms full of police firemen sheriff's deputies and the FEMA guy looks
[02:26:48.280 --> 02:26:52.160]  like a special forces type guy is badmouthing Thomas Jefferson George
[02:26:52.160 --> 02:26:56.560]  Washington anybody that talks about freedoms probably a terrorist and the
[02:26:56.560 --> 02:27:01.200]  cops are nodding and agreeing and it's like I mean it's so alien this is the
[02:27:01.200 --> 02:27:05.880]  heart of America that they are saying is now bad don't cops know that when
[02:27:05.880 --> 02:27:09.640]  there's a foreign banking takeover bad guys are going to come to them and tell
[02:27:09.640 --> 02:27:14.480]  them the good guys are the bad guys I mean look at FEMA they cut the police
[02:27:14.480 --> 02:27:19.200]  communication lines so the cops couldn't aid the public so the feds could come in
[02:27:19.200 --> 02:27:24.360]  and take over that's now on record well that's the Thomas Jefferson quotes and
[02:27:24.360 --> 02:27:28.640]  George Washington all that it must be a a regular speech they give because that's
[02:27:28.640 --> 02:27:29.680]  the same
[02:27:29.680 --> 02:27:30.480]  right
[02:27:30.480 --> 02:27:34.280]  they told us in that meeting also they were demonizing the founding fathers
[02:27:34.280 --> 02:27:36.280]  absolutely
[02:27:36.280 --> 02:27:40.320]  so much of the guy worked for up till recently last couple of months went I
[02:27:40.320 --> 02:27:43.200]  guess the sheriff's association meeting there often I think where was that I'm
[02:27:43.200 --> 02:27:44.240]  not sure
[02:27:44.240 --> 02:27:45.760]  but that note keepers
[02:27:45.760 --> 02:27:47.480]  uh... boot set up
[02:27:47.480 --> 02:27:50.360]  and he took some of their stuff and read it he came back and he was joking to me
[02:27:50.360 --> 02:27:51.960]  about it at the range
[02:27:51.960 --> 02:27:53.760]  about the vote keepers
[02:27:53.760 --> 02:27:55.800]  and I said well I'm a note keeper
[02:27:55.800 --> 02:27:57.680]  and the conversation came to a
[02:27:57.680 --> 02:28:00.020]  dead stop and he looked at me like well
[02:28:00.020 --> 02:28:02.680]  you know what what are you saying I said well I'm just saying that I'm you
[02:28:02.680 --> 02:28:05.280]  know I took an oath and I'm going to defend it and
[02:28:05.280 --> 02:28:07.420]  and he said well if you do what your
[02:28:07.420 --> 02:28:10.680]  both keepers say you're going to do then you really can't have your job in
[02:28:10.680 --> 02:28:11.840]  some instances
[02:28:11.840 --> 02:28:14.160]  and
[02:28:14.160 --> 02:28:15.440]  I was like okay man
[02:28:15.440 --> 02:28:19.880]  oh it's just amazing so why did he swear an oath
[02:28:19.880 --> 02:28:24.400]  if it's so bad to follow your own I mean don't they understand that the germans
[02:28:24.400 --> 02:28:27.800]  would have followed their oath they had a pretty good oath as well that none of
[02:28:27.800 --> 02:28:29.360]  that would happen I mean don't they
[02:28:29.360 --> 02:28:31.440]  realize that they're swearing an oath
[02:28:31.440 --> 02:28:34.920]  because police are either guardians of liberty or pure tyranny
[02:28:34.920 --> 02:28:36.320]  I mean it's the same idea
[02:28:36.320 --> 02:28:39.400]  don't they understand cops are bad in mexico or north korea
[02:28:39.400 --> 02:28:42.680]  don't don't don't don't they get that
[02:28:42.680 --> 02:28:44.000]  for that same old
[02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.440]  and when I recited it
[02:28:46.440 --> 02:28:48.320]  I was waiting to get my badge
[02:28:48.320 --> 02:28:51.040]  and I think that's what happens to a lot of guys just something you say that
[02:28:51.040 --> 02:28:54.000]  sounds
[02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:54.960]  patriotic
[02:28:54.960 --> 02:28:58.000]  and then you move on and it's up first of them everybody's bad and we're the
[02:28:58.000 --> 02:28:59.200]  good guys and
[02:28:59.200 --> 02:29:01.680]  we're the thin blue line all that
[02:29:01.680 --> 02:29:02.880]  garbage
[02:29:02.880 --> 02:29:04.760]  you know but when you grow up a little bit
[02:29:04.760 --> 02:29:07.000]  and you and you've seen enough of it
[02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:09.640]  and you start questioning things
[02:29:09.640 --> 02:29:12.400]  then right there you've stepped out of that uh...
[02:29:12.400 --> 02:29:15.640]  I wouldn't say codicized and of course this is not a blanket statement for all
[02:29:15.640 --> 02:29:18.880]  police no I understand Eric I'm just curious what uh... what jurisdiction are
[02:29:18.880 --> 02:29:20.040]  you in
[02:29:20.040 --> 02:29:23.000]  uh... while I was out in west texas till a few months ago
[02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:26.480]  and I'm not working on the pipeline I've left it
[02:29:26.480 --> 02:29:27.960]  I actually worked up in uh...
[02:29:27.960 --> 02:29:32.960]  north of Austin for many years and went out to uh...
[02:29:32.960 --> 02:29:35.960]  you know what you know what we've got a guest coming up but I want the guest to
[02:29:35.960 --> 02:29:37.480]  hear this when we come back
[02:29:37.480 --> 02:29:39.640]  just briefly to Bruce Fine
[02:29:39.640 --> 02:29:42.640]  tell him the type of stuff they say about George Washington
[02:29:42.640 --> 02:29:44.880]  and Thomas Jefferson we have it on video but
[02:29:44.880 --> 02:29:46.240]  we want to hear it from you
[02:29:46.240 --> 02:29:49.000]  and then we'll bring our guest up to comment on what you say
[02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:52.080]  stay with us
[02:29:52.080 --> 02:29:53.480]  we're on the march

[02:31:01.400 --> 02:31:04.520]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[02:31:04.520 --> 02:31:05.880]  solar power generator
[02:31:05.880 --> 02:31:06.800]  number one
[02:31:06.800 --> 02:31:10.240]  new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[02:31:10.240 --> 02:31:11.080]  number two
[02:31:11.080 --> 02:31:14.800]  our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[02:31:14.800 --> 02:31:15.960]  allows you to have
[02:31:15.960 --> 02:31:16.760]  it's true
[02:31:16.760 --> 02:31:20.080]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:31:20.080 --> 02:31:21.600]  technology is coming
[02:31:21.600 --> 02:31:22.400]  number three
[02:31:22.400 --> 02:31:26.000]  in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:28.280]  and now new socialist legislation

[02:33:36.840 --> 02:33:39.440]  to be brought back up even though it passed unanimously
[02:33:39.440 --> 02:33:42.760]  to then be killed by perry's minion do-hurst in the senate
[02:33:42.760 --> 02:33:45.480]  according to senators uh... who blew the whistle on him
[02:33:45.480 --> 02:33:47.840]  like seniors said as senator

[02:33:55.560 --> 02:33:57.760]  why didn't perry do that on his own

[02:34:00.720 --> 02:34:04.120]  and prison planet dot com the point is the fight is on
[02:34:04.120 --> 02:34:08.720]  now bruce fine uh... who is one of the leading constitutional law scholars
[02:34:08.720 --> 02:34:10.320]  advisor to congress
[02:34:10.320 --> 02:34:11.720]  uh... ron paul
[02:34:11.720 --> 02:34:14.200]  uh... says that uh... he's a big
[02:34:14.200 --> 02:34:16.440]  follower of uh... mister fines
[02:34:16.440 --> 02:34:18.080]  take on things he's quoted
[02:34:18.080 --> 02:34:20.960]  on the cover of the constitutional peril saying bruce fein
[02:34:20.960 --> 02:34:23.360]  one of the most important legal minds on our time
[02:34:23.360 --> 02:34:25.640]  we're gonna be uh... talking to bruce here in a moment
[02:34:25.640 --> 02:34:29.200]  but finishing up eric i have the training manuals i have the videos the
[02:34:29.200 --> 02:34:30.360]  police in us
[02:34:30.360 --> 02:34:33.560]  not just the manuals saying george washington bad
[02:34:33.560 --> 02:34:37.800]  uh... thomas jefferson bad ron paul bad bob barbad
[02:34:37.800 --> 02:34:40.440]  uh... anybody that talks about the constitution bad
[02:34:40.440 --> 02:34:41.400]  i mean it
[02:34:41.400 --> 02:34:44.720]  you but but you were saying that you were taught the same stuff
[02:34:44.720 --> 02:34:45.840]  in texas
[02:34:45.840 --> 02:34:49.160]  with uh... a mister fine listening
[02:34:49.160 --> 02:34:52.600]  uh... tell folks the type of song and dance you were told about the founding
[02:34:52.600 --> 02:34:53.880]  fathers
[02:34:53.880 --> 02:34:58.320]  i was told to be on the lookout for anybody that espouse is that
[02:34:58.320 --> 02:35:01.720]  because they're probably right wing extremists
[02:35:01.720 --> 02:35:05.240]  one of the folks we need to look for a little before i even read my report
[02:35:05.240 --> 02:35:06.640]  or anything else
[02:35:06.640 --> 02:35:11.200]  and so it's i think it's pretty much a standard they go around the country
[02:35:11.200 --> 02:35:13.800]  and they're there in the process of militarizing all of us
[02:35:13.800 --> 02:35:17.440]  i mean every cop wants to get on swat and they've got all the good toys and
[02:35:17.440 --> 02:35:20.840]  i've done it i've been on swat for years and
[02:35:20.840 --> 02:35:23.000]  it's just got to the point of being ridiculous
[02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:24.160]  you know it really has
[02:35:24.160 --> 02:35:26.960]  and uh... all over the country they're announcing that they're gonna swat
[02:35:26.960 --> 02:35:28.200]  team even for
[02:35:28.200 --> 02:35:30.800]  unpaid uh... speeding tickets
[02:35:30.800 --> 02:35:34.320]  so it's just you know they're using their use of the fear of all the officers
[02:35:34.320 --> 02:35:36.120]  that have been getting shot lately
[02:35:36.120 --> 02:35:40.120]  they're using that to stoke our fears and we go in heavy-handed and that's
[02:35:40.120 --> 02:35:43.400]  but you know what's going to happen that's going to lead to more people
[02:35:43.400 --> 02:35:47.320]  who are going to start fighting you see how it's a self-fulfilling prophecy
[02:35:47.320 --> 02:35:49.440]  it exactly is
[02:35:49.440 --> 02:35:52.960]  absolutely all right well uh... god bless you eric and we appreciate your call
[02:35:52.960 --> 02:35:55.680]  too bad you decided to get off the force because of all of it because it'd be
[02:35:55.680 --> 02:35:56.520]  good to have

[02:37:17.360 --> 02:37:21.880]  uh... but sir looking at three months ago obama following the u n directive
[02:37:21.880 --> 02:37:23.960]  saying for the prestige of the u n
[02:37:23.960 --> 02:37:28.480]  he didn't need congress congress servile comes to them last week and says
[02:37:28.480 --> 02:37:31.320]  here's secret arrest killing of american citizens

[02:37:33.600 --> 02:37:37.800]  and how did the emperor respond
[02:37:37.800 --> 02:37:39.560]  he responded by
[02:37:39.560 --> 02:37:44.880]  at the beginning of the idea that he would even accept congressional
[02:37:44.880 --> 02:37:45.840]  counting up
[02:37:45.840 --> 02:37:47.980]  or that he'd already told him
[02:37:47.980 --> 02:37:49.560]  when he had proclaimed that
[02:37:49.560 --> 02:37:53.320]  he may you know i don't use the military anywhere he won
[02:37:53.320 --> 02:37:54.360]  in the name of
[02:37:54.360 --> 02:37:55.840]  regional stability
[02:37:55.840 --> 02:38:00.520]  credibility of the u n security councils overflow of refugees
[02:38:00.520 --> 02:38:06.280]  humanitarian causes indeed anything that he thought was disturbing on the planet
[02:38:06.280 --> 02:38:08.520]  uh... which was the most uh...
[02:38:08.520 --> 02:38:10.440]  egregious use the patient of
[02:38:10.440 --> 02:38:14.120]  legislative power in the history of the united
[02:38:14.120 --> 02:38:14.720]  and
[02:38:14.720 --> 02:38:16.600]  he does that without watching
[02:38:16.600 --> 02:38:19.360]  uh... without recognizing that he had now
[02:38:19.360 --> 02:38:21.560]  has become the king george the third
[02:38:21.560 --> 02:38:23.480]  which was the object of our
[02:38:23.480 --> 02:38:24.200]  uh...
[02:38:24.200 --> 02:38:28.960]  revulsion and repudiation in seventeen seventy-six and it's truly astonishing
[02:38:28.960 --> 02:38:30.200]  when your former
[02:38:30.200 --> 02:38:33.560]  uh... viewer at that uh... our participant
[02:38:33.560 --> 02:38:36.040]  our founding fathers are being scorned
[02:38:36.040 --> 02:38:37.640]  they're being smear death
[02:38:37.640 --> 02:38:41.280]  uh... this is basically the kind of revolution if you will
[02:38:41.280 --> 02:38:44.480]  uh... the uh... the polio in the eighties of room air
[02:38:44.480 --> 02:38:47.880]  uh... for the united states of america and indeed it's true
[02:38:47.880 --> 02:38:51.280]  uh... we have lost the republic on the installment plan it's not something that
[02:38:51.280 --> 02:38:52.560]  happened overnight
[02:38:52.560 --> 02:38:56.120]  it's been an ever-increasing encroachment of executive authority and
[02:38:56.120 --> 02:38:59.280]  military supremacy from the mexico-american war
[02:38:59.280 --> 02:39:01.840]  eighteen forty six eighteen forty eight
[02:39:01.840 --> 02:39:06.200]  and now we've got a political culture that is passive that is the key
[02:39:06.200 --> 02:39:07.920]  that except that's the way
[02:39:07.920 --> 02:39:10.640]  and the name of uh... making a pretty
[02:39:10.640 --> 02:39:12.120]  and it's quite a
[02:39:12.120 --> 02:39:16.240]  that's something that would be shocking to the founding fathers is all i think
[02:39:16.240 --> 02:39:19.680]  ron paul last week said this is the final nail
[02:39:19.680 --> 02:39:22.760]  if this goes through and obama says i don't even need that power i'll do
[02:39:22.760 --> 02:39:24.040]  whatever i want
[02:39:24.040 --> 02:39:27.080]  i've got the u n i mean this is this not
[02:39:27.080 --> 02:39:28.680]  but as you said the greatest
[02:39:28.680 --> 02:39:32.440]  power grab the most unconstitutional action in our history
[02:39:32.440 --> 02:39:35.840]  and i have to agree with you i mean on its face is a total statement
[02:39:35.840 --> 02:39:39.280]  break down what's happened what is now unfolding
[02:39:39.280 --> 02:39:44.120]  and uh... and and and and why you use words like that to describe it
[02:39:44.120 --> 02:39:45.960]  think of the type of medical
[02:39:45.960 --> 02:39:46.480]  uh...
[02:39:46.480 --> 02:39:50.080]  suppose the president of the united states whoever it is
[02:39:50.080 --> 02:39:53.680]  can be a republican or democrat obama or a person someone else
[02:39:53.680 --> 02:39:57.280]  uh... this evening those are national television and he says
[02:39:57.280 --> 02:39:59.840]  i've got secret intelligence that shows that
[02:39:59.840 --> 02:40:02.240]  unless i have to spend the constitution
[02:40:02.240 --> 02:40:06.920]  declare martial law and impose the military as supreme over the civilian
[02:40:06.920 --> 02:40:07.560]  court
[02:40:07.560 --> 02:40:12.080]  we will suffer another nine eleven and therefore i will try to restore your
[02:40:12.080 --> 02:40:15.920]  liberties as soon as possible but right now i've got to be changed
[02:40:15.920 --> 02:40:19.160]  if the president did that i think our culture would accept it
[02:40:19.160 --> 02:40:22.640]  i think there would be no cry for impeachment and removal from office
[02:40:22.640 --> 02:40:26.000]  and no uh... no i know i'll cry that this is uh...
[02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:29.040]  uh... a user patient and in total
[02:40:29.040 --> 02:40:31.200]  uh... capitulation to fear
[02:40:31.200 --> 02:40:33.760]  and to uh... uh... dictatorship
[02:40:33.760 --> 02:40:37.760]  and this would be something that the american people
[02:40:37.760 --> 02:40:39.040]  would accept
[02:40:39.040 --> 02:40:42.600]  that would shock your thinking for our colegula
[02:40:42.600 --> 02:40:45.680]  to yet to be the president obama is not yet colegula
[02:40:45.680 --> 02:40:48.640]  but as soon as one arrives we have now set
[02:40:48.640 --> 02:40:49.760]  the precedent
[02:40:49.760 --> 02:40:54.640]  and the political culture that will indulge the dictator
[02:40:54.640 --> 02:40:57.160]  now bruce your cell phone was breaking up
[02:40:57.160 --> 02:40:59.160]  right there during that key point
[02:40:59.160 --> 02:41:02.640]  uh... please repeat the last sixty seconds of what you were saying
[02:41:02.640 --> 02:41:04.440]  what i'm saying is that
[02:41:04.440 --> 02:41:06.440]  the congress of the united states
[02:41:06.440 --> 02:41:08.280]  uh... the american people have
[02:41:08.280 --> 02:41:11.200]  cultivated have accepted a political culture
[02:41:11.200 --> 02:41:14.200]  uh... that will accept uh... a dictatorship the next time we have a
[02:41:14.200 --> 02:41:17.360]  colegula in the president as opposed to obama that is
[02:41:17.360 --> 02:41:19.560]  in the name of being made
[02:41:19.560 --> 02:41:20.960]  safe and risk free
[02:41:20.960 --> 02:41:23.600]  they will accept bachelors in whatever the president
[02:41:23.600 --> 02:41:27.080]  ordains is needed for their safety they will accept
[02:41:27.080 --> 02:41:30.320]  uh... and that if they use the final if you will
[02:41:30.320 --> 02:41:34.360]  uh... representative death now to the republic when the people are no longer
[02:41:34.360 --> 02:41:36.520]  willing to fight for their liberties
[02:41:36.520 --> 02:41:40.400]  uh... it was said by john quincy adams one of our former president that
[02:41:40.400 --> 02:41:42.880]  the glory of republic is a liberty
[02:41:42.880 --> 02:41:46.920]  the glory of a empire is domination and dominion
[02:41:46.920 --> 02:41:48.600]  and i think we have now
[02:41:48.600 --> 02:41:50.600]  uh... jumped into the empire
[02:41:50.600 --> 02:41:53.960]  rather than the republican phase of our evolution
[02:41:53.960 --> 02:41:55.840]  now bruce when you say
[02:41:55.840 --> 02:41:57.800]  obama is no colegula
[02:41:57.800 --> 02:41:59.560]  clearly the office
[02:41:59.560 --> 02:42:03.120]  has taken on endless wars torture secret arrest
[02:42:03.120 --> 02:42:04.800]  warrantless wiretapping
[02:42:04.800 --> 02:42:08.840]  uh... quite colligial and uh... type uh... attributes
[02:42:08.840 --> 02:42:10.720]  but it is this
[02:42:10.720 --> 02:42:11.640]  puppet
[02:42:11.640 --> 02:42:13.760]  financed president
[02:42:13.760 --> 02:42:18.200]  uh... this office that that now has these powers in the republican
[02:42:18.200 --> 02:42:21.680]  and democratic parties are always wanting to
[02:42:21.680 --> 02:42:24.200]  heat more of these powers on to them
[02:42:24.200 --> 02:42:27.000]  and we see the hyping of the threat of terror
[02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:31.080]  and and and you're turning it into a a a a fetish of of of
[02:42:31.080 --> 02:42:32.680]  of jingo isms
[02:42:32.680 --> 02:42:35.480]  where it's a new religion to be the land of the cowards
[02:42:35.480 --> 02:42:37.120]  the home of the slaves
[02:42:37.120 --> 02:42:39.640]  uh... and so we're all ready there
[02:42:39.640 --> 02:42:43.960]  i mean there could be an event any day and and i think the general public
[02:42:43.960 --> 02:42:45.880]  is starting to wake up a certain extent
[02:42:45.880 --> 02:42:48.960]  but but only to the fact that there's a problem they have no idea
[02:42:48.960 --> 02:42:50.440]  just how bad it is
[02:42:50.440 --> 02:42:52.920]  and a lot of people think well tyranny just means
[02:42:52.920 --> 02:42:55.000]  our government will go kill some brown people
[02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:57.320]  but with that tyranny you have the waivers
[02:42:57.320 --> 02:43:00.600]  for insiders to not have to get insurance but your company does
[02:43:00.600 --> 02:43:04.280]  you have the four thousand dollar fines for trimming your crepe myrtle tree
[02:43:04.280 --> 02:43:07.700]  you have to get an environmental assessment for a fireworks display
[02:43:07.700 --> 02:43:09.240]  and we see the
[02:43:09.240 --> 02:43:12.800]  the the the damn breaking and tyranny at every level
[02:43:12.800 --> 02:43:15.920]  just pouring in your comments on that
[02:43:15.920 --> 02:43:19.880]  i think what you've stated that the president the intellectual theory
[02:43:19.880 --> 02:43:23.920]  of a complete uh... dictatorship that we typically associate with a style in
[02:43:23.920 --> 02:43:25.440]  a mile in china
[02:43:25.440 --> 02:43:26.200]  are there
[02:43:26.200 --> 02:43:27.200]  it's just that
[02:43:27.200 --> 02:43:29.600]  and i'm not saying that in an individualized
[02:43:29.600 --> 02:43:33.480]  uh... way all the particular course that you've identified torture
[02:43:33.480 --> 02:43:36.120]  detentions without trial indefinitely
[02:43:36.120 --> 02:43:39.640]  putting american citizens on the vaccination list without any judicial
[02:43:39.640 --> 02:43:41.520]  checks military commission
[02:43:41.520 --> 02:43:43.000]  that combined judge durian
[02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:45.040]  prosecutor in lieu of civilian court
[02:43:45.040 --> 02:43:46.880]  they're all there but right now
[02:43:46.880 --> 02:43:51.160]  the victims are largely uh... uh... in in isolated
[02:43:51.160 --> 02:43:53.920]  uh... communities you know that the most one there
[02:43:53.920 --> 02:43:58.040]  the uh... the underprivileged to largely dominate the all-voluntary force
[02:43:58.040 --> 02:44:02.720]  who are sent abroad to give that last full measure of devotion to a political
[02:44:02.720 --> 02:44:04.880]  uh... union or president can
[02:44:04.880 --> 02:44:08.840]  avoid saying i lost the war you know totally giving their life up for
[02:44:08.840 --> 02:44:10.800]  virtually nothing all those are there
[02:44:10.800 --> 02:44:14.920]  it just isn't as widespread as you would expect that we associate with the
[02:44:14.920 --> 02:44:17.040]  horrors of a full dictatorship
[02:44:17.040 --> 02:44:20.600]  but i think that's the earmark of a mature people to recognize when the
[02:44:20.600 --> 02:44:24.640]  president of the best and it's all the line there before we fall in the off the
[02:44:24.640 --> 02:44:25.800]  entire clip
[02:44:25.800 --> 02:44:29.360]  uh... but the path to the cliff it has been laid as you said there
[02:44:29.360 --> 02:44:31.680]  it's just a matter of time unless we retreat
[02:44:31.680 --> 02:44:33.280]  uh... before we fall over
[02:44:33.280 --> 02:44:35.040]  uh... can you comment on
[02:44:35.040 --> 02:44:36.960]  the supreme court
[02:44:36.960 --> 02:44:39.640]  really breaking down the fourth amendment two weeks ago
[02:44:39.640 --> 02:44:41.840]  the indiana supreme court saying
[02:44:41.840 --> 02:44:44.680]  quote officers can come in your house without warrants
[02:44:44.680 --> 02:44:48.200]  for any reason or no reason at all that's a quote by the chief justice
[02:44:48.200 --> 02:44:50.440]  de mexico supreme court just ruled
[02:44:50.440 --> 02:44:53.920]  cops at at at traffic stops can take guns
[02:44:53.920 --> 02:44:57.200]  from law-abiding uh... drivers for no reason
[02:44:57.200 --> 02:45:01.040]  i mean right now there seems to be a coming out of the closet they built the
[02:45:01.040 --> 02:45:02.120]  tyranny
[02:45:02.120 --> 02:45:07.440]  the uh... you know over the hill but now they're rolling this juggernaut directly
[02:45:07.440 --> 02:45:08.600]  at us
[02:45:08.600 --> 02:45:12.000]  uh... your comments on that and and and why is there such a
[02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:13.480]  origin now
[02:45:13.480 --> 02:45:17.120]  uh... hiking their leg on its demonstrating the tyranny what is
[02:45:17.120 --> 02:45:19.440]  precipitating that
[02:45:19.440 --> 02:45:21.120]  well it's all part of the
[02:45:21.120 --> 02:45:22.960]  philosophy if you will let
[02:45:22.960 --> 02:45:27.000]  uh... better faith in a battle than be free and and have the tiniest amount of
[02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:30.520]  risk uh... and i let me just sort of put it as a background here to these
[02:45:30.520 --> 02:45:32.000]  observations that
[02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:35.760]  the extension of the patriot act three provisions that are largely
[02:45:35.760 --> 02:45:38.680]  completely shown to be useful at over ten years in
[02:45:38.680 --> 02:45:41.320]  preventing any act of international terrorism but
[02:45:41.320 --> 02:45:43.520]  all of them dvd from the fundamental
[02:45:43.520 --> 02:45:47.120]  or commitment principle that you don't disturb someone's privacy until there's
[02:45:47.120 --> 02:45:48.760]  probable cause of leave
[02:45:48.760 --> 02:45:50.120]  complicity in crime
[02:45:50.120 --> 02:45:53.000]  and that is just been thrown out the window and they're now admittedly
[02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:57.000]  thousands of times per state a year using the patriot act in non-terror
[02:45:57.000 --> 02:45:58.000]  related
[02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:01.400]  oh yeah the most of the most of the patriotic stories are going after a drug
[02:46:01.400 --> 02:46:04.560]  that they're organized crime of things that nothing to do with international
[02:46:04.560 --> 02:46:08.000]  terrorism yet or deportation of immigration crime
[02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:12.600]  uh... but and but to go back to where we began at the country was in seventeen
[02:46:12.600 --> 02:46:16.560]  sixty one that came though it was been out in british with the defense they
[02:46:16.560 --> 02:46:20.240]  were general warrants that enabled all the petty officers of the british
[02:46:20.240 --> 02:46:24.360]  to run the people's homes and businesses searching for contraband etc and
[02:46:24.360 --> 02:46:25.960]  the king at that time that well
[02:46:25.960 --> 02:46:28.640]  if you don't have your innocence and why do you care whether we come into your
[02:46:28.640 --> 02:46:29.560]  bedroom you know
[02:46:29.560 --> 02:46:31.800]  and you know if you have nothing to hide let it that
[02:46:31.800 --> 02:46:35.360]  let it be big brother and serve a lot of people from cranny of your existence
[02:46:35.360 --> 02:46:35.840]  and
[02:46:35.840 --> 02:46:40.600]  fronting brother said well we are born with the unable right to one of those
[02:46:40.600 --> 02:46:41.140]  is
[02:46:41.140 --> 02:46:45.040]  a liberty and you do not have a right to encroach on our liberty and let you
[02:46:45.040 --> 02:46:48.880]  shoulder the burden of believing we're involved in crime we don't need to
[02:46:48.880 --> 02:46:51.840]  justify our liberty inherent of breathing
[02:46:51.840 --> 02:46:53.960]  and respiring as a human being
[02:46:53.960 --> 02:46:57.680]  and that was the part that led to the revolution according to john adams so
[02:46:57.680 --> 02:47:00.800]  the fourth amendment the idea of the right to be left alone was not a
[02:47:00.800 --> 02:47:04.720]  marginal element of the revolution indeed it was every bit of central is no
[02:47:04.720 --> 02:47:06.880]  taxation without representation
[02:47:06.880 --> 02:47:08.760]  and the general idea was that
[02:47:08.760 --> 02:47:10.480]  the threshold of the government
[02:47:10.480 --> 02:47:12.280]  they'd be a little into your privacy
[02:47:12.280 --> 02:47:16.160]  uh... was only authorized when there was probably caused to believe you were
[02:47:16.160 --> 02:47:17.320]  evidence was uh...
[02:47:17.320 --> 02:47:21.200]  was a indicator of a crime that brings us out of the t s a
[02:47:21.200 --> 02:47:24.360]  uh... fb i can't stick their hands down your pants a lot of warrant
[02:47:24.360 --> 02:47:25.760]  what are the feds doing
[02:47:25.760 --> 02:47:28.760]  now on the street school problems if you haven't heard
[02:47:28.760 --> 02:47:30.480]  uh... running wilds
[02:47:30.480 --> 02:47:32.440]  first outside the pants now
[02:47:32.440 --> 02:47:36.800]  in the pants of miss america in dallas are they not openly trying to set the
[02:47:36.800 --> 02:47:39.280]  precedent and break our will
[02:47:39.280 --> 02:47:42.560]  but yes they're trying to get it to cut them through the big brother state you
[02:47:42.560 --> 02:47:45.000]  know to reach your door well nineteen eighty four
[02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:46.160]  that if there's a
[02:47:46.160 --> 02:47:49.640]  if it's a variation of what they can you call the one-percent doctor and even
[02:47:49.640 --> 02:47:51.880]  worse you know it's about the one million percent
[02:47:51.880 --> 02:47:54.840]  that if there's a million percent that something is true
[02:47:54.840 --> 02:47:58.400]  you treated as an absolute certainly like the force of gravity and precede
[02:47:58.400 --> 02:47:59.760]  pace and you can think
[02:47:59.760 --> 02:48:03.480]  if you look at your ordinary person with his life with a one-percent here you'd
[02:48:03.480 --> 02:48:04.760]  never get out of that
[02:48:04.760 --> 02:48:08.480]  if you treated everything is absolutely true that was one percent less likely
[02:48:08.480 --> 02:48:09.360]  to happen
[02:48:09.360 --> 02:48:13.160]  you know you'd be frozen and paralyzed with fear that you could have a car wreck
[02:48:13.160 --> 02:48:14.800]  your children could be killed
[02:48:14.800 --> 02:48:17.880]  and you've got a thousand times better chance of dying from that
[02:48:17.880 --> 02:48:20.680]  then from terror but now we've got to give up all of our rights because of
[02:48:20.680 --> 02:48:22.120]  terror very well said
[02:48:22.120 --> 02:48:25.680]  what about in in in new york state may produce the bill
[02:48:25.680 --> 02:48:27.920]  that all of the hotel
[02:48:27.920 --> 02:48:33.280]  cleaner people have to wear panic buttons because all men might be rapist
[02:48:33.280 --> 02:48:37.320]  because dominate strouse con might have grabbed a woman's rear end i mean this
[02:48:37.320 --> 02:48:41.560]  idea that government's going to keep you safe with a panopticon of surveillance
[02:48:41.560 --> 02:48:43.600]  who keeps us safe from them
[02:48:43.600 --> 02:48:45.400]  that exactly right who's going to
[02:48:45.400 --> 02:48:49.280]  who's going to guard the car you know and i don't not trust me and always
[02:48:49.280 --> 02:48:50.320]  remember this
[02:48:50.320 --> 02:48:53.840]  uh... the government can always do more mischief than any particular individual
[02:48:53.840 --> 02:48:56.480]  can that's why if you choose between the two dangers
[02:48:56.480 --> 02:48:59.800]  except the danger of the individual because the government authority
[02:48:59.800 --> 02:49:02.000]  an ability to destroy your life is that
[02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:05.560]  it's many fold more than any individual that doesn't say that there's not going
[02:49:05.560 --> 02:49:06.840]  to be tragedy there are
[02:49:06.840 --> 02:49:10.000]  that's what life in some sense is about it in its capable but would you rather
[02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:14.320]  face the danger of the mob or somebody in the street or a big organized
[02:49:14.320 --> 02:49:17.000]  government look what governments have done last century killed hundreds of
[02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:20.200]  millions looking at ron paul's speech
[02:49:20.200 --> 02:49:23.920]  uh... the last nail in the coffin and ron paul almost breaking down saying
[02:49:23.920 --> 02:49:26.640]  this is just so over the top
[02:49:26.640 --> 02:49:30.520]  why would congress in a servile way run to obama and say we want to make you
[02:49:30.520 --> 02:49:32.440]  king
[02:49:32.440 --> 02:49:34.360]  because congress
[02:49:34.360 --> 02:49:37.480]  given it so pining powerly nature
[02:49:37.480 --> 02:49:39.160]  it rejoices in
[02:49:39.160 --> 02:49:41.960]  keeping responsibility for anything
[02:49:41.960 --> 02:49:45.760]  that's why you get a line item vetoes give all the power to the president and
[02:49:45.760 --> 02:49:48.800]  then you can't accuse us of doing anything wrong and we can't decide
[02:49:48.800 --> 02:49:50.000]  anything except
[02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:54.560]  the potted plants that will adore you know our offices and our committee hearing
[02:49:54.560 --> 02:49:56.320]  and that's where we've come to it
[02:49:56.320 --> 02:49:59.720]  it's a problem of the founding fathers as geniuses they were they didn't quite
[02:49:59.720 --> 02:50:02.520]  comprehend that one branch could be found
[02:50:02.520 --> 02:50:04.880]  those feet that would really deal
[02:50:04.880 --> 02:50:09.040]  and glee and and clap at the surrender of their powers but that is what is going

[02:50:51.520 --> 02:50:55.120]  for a member of congress who isn't going to take account of these major

[02:54:10.400 --> 02:54:16.760]  folks some Americans think empire and tyranny and torture is sexy when the

[02:54:20.600 --> 02:54:27.320]  ways to Sunday it will conscript your children is military chattel it you
[02:54:27.320 --> 02:54:33.280]  name it and on every front this country has political cancer and talking to
[02:54:33.280 --> 02:54:38.000]  constitutional law scholar his latest book is American Empire before the fall
[02:54:38.000 --> 02:54:41.960]  that's his new book and we're now here at the Empire we were talking during the
[02:54:41.960 --> 02:54:47.080]  break about Ron Paul speech but also the training manuals the videos the cop
[02:54:47.080 --> 02:54:50.840]  that called in earlier where they demonize the founding fathers I mean if
[02:54:50.840 --> 02:54:53.680]  I was a cop and they were demonizing the founding fathers I would know you're
[02:54:53.680 --> 02:55:00.760]  demonizing America but they they truly think America is bad it's such a mind
[02:55:00.760 --> 02:55:09.400]  trick how do they do that Bruce well it's show is how a political culture can
[02:55:09.400 --> 02:55:13.600]  warp a word an original meaning that they just like they did in Georgia was
[02:55:13.600 --> 02:55:18.840]  1984 you know the Ministry of Wars the Ministry of Peace and so even though the
[02:55:18.840 --> 02:55:23.200]  Constitution bequeath a republic and ever Benjamin Franklin a republic if you
[02:55:23.200 --> 02:55:27.840]  can keep it the culture has warped the words in the meaning of the document so
[02:55:27.840 --> 02:55:31.840]  now what was intended as a republic is now an empire we saw that a little
[02:55:31.840 --> 02:55:35.440]  different way to during the hundred years of Jim Crow after the Civil War
[02:55:35.440 --> 02:55:40.600]  equal protection non-discrimination then men white supremacy and it took really a
[02:55:40.600 --> 02:55:45.480]  cultural revolution with many very brave people dying including freedom
[02:55:45.480 --> 02:55:48.960]  riders and better before the original meaning returned and that's where we
[02:55:48.960 --> 02:55:54.120]  are today come to my mind to try to denigrate and and demonize the founding
[02:55:54.120 --> 02:55:58.800]  fathers is somehow unfaithful to our mission as a country is and the last
[02:55:58.800 --> 02:56:03.240]  time I read about somebody who did that we called them Benedict Arnold and
[02:56:03.240 --> 02:56:06.640]  Benedict Arnold was viewed as a traitor and not somebody who was loyal to the
[02:56:06.640 --> 02:56:10.960]  United States and these are the sentiments that would have lied people to
[02:56:10.960 --> 02:56:16.200]  King George III and fighting against the George Washington at Yorktown fighting
[02:56:16.200 --> 02:56:21.680]  against the George Washington at Saratoga etc so again this is this is
[02:56:21.680 --> 02:56:26.520]  truly shocking and it shows in what this repute in contempt our Constitution is
[02:56:26.520 --> 02:56:31.120]  being held and yet it is our birth certificate either our North Star if
[02:56:31.120 --> 02:56:34.320]  we're going to keep away from the ruination that is afflicted all
[02:56:34.320 --> 02:56:39.000]  empires in closing you concur with Ron Paul's analysis that this is allowed to
[02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:44.600]  continue to go through is the final nail in the coffin yes I do we're standing at
[02:56:44.600 --> 02:56:48.680]  that the Rubicon and if we let this pass without review you know the president
[02:56:48.680 --> 02:56:52.560]  just deciding the heck with a war powers resolution the heck with the law I do
[02:56:52.560 --> 02:56:58.400]  things on my own then it's just a matter of time again before we have someone
[02:56:58.400 --> 02:57:02.760]  who's as bad as Collegial and it will then overtly suspend the Constitution
[02:57:02.760 --> 02:57:06.800]  let's doing it on the installment plan and we will be back to where we were
[02:57:06.800 --> 02:57:12.000]  when we were fighting in 1776 the retrogression of 235 years well that's
[02:57:12.000 --> 02:57:16.080]  like the Fed saying there's no states rights why do we even have states that's
[02:57:16.080 --> 02:57:19.880]  like the state saying government saying that they run the parents why even have
[02:57:19.880 --> 02:57:25.000]  parents I mean why even have a House and Senate if we're gonna have this I mean
[02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:30.360]  it's history is repeating itself historically in closing what type of
[02:57:30.360 --> 02:57:36.800]  horrors generally come from this direction we're going in the horrors
[02:57:36.800 --> 02:57:43.360]  come when we suspend trials people who are politically unpopular suffer
[02:57:43.360 --> 02:57:48.480]  persecution not for what they did but for what they think and all of the
[02:57:48.480 --> 02:57:52.480]  privacy is invaded and the police are the law rather than being subject to the
[02:57:52.480 --> 02:57:57.120]  law again all all empires fall through a nation in particularly different ways
[02:57:57.120 --> 02:58:02.640]  but the most decisive element is this in the Republican in our Constitution the
[02:58:02.640 --> 02:58:06.360]  individual is the center of the constitutional universe and Liberty is
[02:58:06.360 --> 02:58:10.200]  foremost and government is there to secure the unethical rights of
[02:58:10.200 --> 02:58:15.200]  individuals in an empire government is first big and bigger and stronger
[02:58:15.200 --> 02:58:18.760]  government is the center of the constitutional universe and anything
[02:58:18.760 --> 02:58:22.080]  anything that can make government bigger and stronger in the name of safety
[02:58:22.080 --> 02:58:26.600]  goes and that's exactly where we're headed if we do not draw the line here
[02:58:26.600 --> 02:58:31.240]  and and it was in so-called retreat into the safety of the Republic that the
[02:58:31.240 --> 02:58:35.560]  founding fathers though nobly Bruce Bruce stay there you've got to go fine if
[02:58:35.560 --> 02:58:39.120]  not we're back in one minute I want you to talk about solutions in a final five

[02:59:01.000 --> 02:59:05.000]  off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at
[02:59:05.000 --> 02:59:10.360]  home have tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really
[02:59:10.360 --> 02:59:15.160]  are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[02:59:15.160 --> 02:59:19.480]  citizens to pay attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[02:59:19.480 --> 02:59:24.760]  nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[02:59:24.760 --> 02:59:29.080]  its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists
[02:59:29.080 --> 02:59:32.560]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[02:59:32.560 --> 02:59:37.800]  checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we
[02:59:37.800 --> 02:59:43.800]  have seen a fall of the Republic yet your copy a fall of the Republic on DVD at

[02:59:57.280 --> 03:00:04.000]  the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network network all right final five minutes
[03:00:04.000 --> 03:00:10.520]  with constitutional law expert Bruce Fine looking at this empire I want to
[03:00:10.520 --> 03:00:15.720]  talk about briefly some solutions what are you the ways that you see to restore
[03:00:15.720 --> 03:00:20.040]  sanity to try to reverse this destruction of the Republic with the
[03:00:20.040 --> 03:00:25.360]  Republicans loving tyranny the leadership the Democrats loving it as the
[03:00:25.360 --> 03:00:29.160]  corruption mounts as the debts amount their answer is more government more
[03:00:29.160 --> 03:00:34.040]  tyranny how do we reverse this disaster because obviously the liberty we've had
[03:00:34.040 --> 03:00:38.520]  in this country were while not perfect became the model of the world and the
[03:00:38.520 --> 03:00:43.320]  engine of ideas and wealth and now as we lose the liberty we see the wealth
[03:00:43.320 --> 03:00:48.200]  draining away because it's a historical fact that the two are connected
[03:00:48.200 --> 03:00:52.160]  absolutely right the rule of law is what attracts investment and it provides
[03:00:52.160 --> 03:00:56.200]  the confidence about the future that enables the economics to flourish but
[03:00:56.200 --> 03:00:59.720]  what is the remedy you know the institutions as you point out are
[03:00:59.720 --> 03:01:03.720]  already compromised and the remedy really is public education the American
[03:01:03.720 --> 03:01:07.440]  people just have to stand up and say enough is enough I mean if they could do
[03:01:07.440 --> 03:01:10.880]  it in Egypt if they can do it in Tunisia if the Pakistani lawyers can
[03:01:10.880 --> 03:01:14.120]  revolt against dictatorship the American people have to have the same courage
[03:01:14.120 --> 03:01:17.480]  and we don't need to go to the streets right now we just need to go to the
[03:01:17.480 --> 03:01:21.280]  ballot box and my idea is a you have a member running for the Congress the
[03:01:21.280 --> 03:01:24.360]  United States unless they pledge they're gonna enforce their authority to decide
[03:01:24.360 --> 03:01:28.160]  on war and peace they're gonna decide what taxes go or not they're gonna decide
[03:01:28.160 --> 03:01:31.640]  whether your privacy is evaded they will accept accountability they know I
[03:01:31.640 --> 03:01:34.960]  don't want you to be there if you're a part of plan I don't need wallpaper to
[03:01:34.960 --> 03:01:38.040]  pay for you know at a hundred and seventy or hundred eighty thousand dollars a
[03:01:38.040 --> 03:01:42.000]  year and the American people have to run this witness test after every single
[03:01:42.000 --> 03:01:46.080]  candidate for the Congress we hear all these statements of how much they
[03:01:46.080 --> 03:01:50.080]  stabilize the Constitution and then they then they arrive in Washington and the
[03:01:50.080 --> 03:01:54.120]  first thing they do they put us a torch to the Constitution so we need to we
[03:01:54.120 --> 03:01:58.080]  need to review can we tell you to get these people who pledged and they read
[03:01:58.080 --> 03:02:01.360]  it on the floor of Congress every word of the Constitution and then they turn
[03:02:01.360 --> 03:02:06.080]  around and cloud exactly what they read and say this is it's an aroused citizen
[03:02:06.080 --> 03:02:09.800]  and they say we should take inspiration from some of these other countries where
[03:02:09.800 --> 03:02:13.320]  they don't have nearly the opportunities their freedom of expression and the
[03:02:13.320 --> 03:02:17.040]  ability to change things peacefully that we do here and what we've got to be
[03:02:17.040 --> 03:02:20.400]  involved we can't think it's gonna happen by spontaneous combustion that's
[03:02:20.400 --> 03:02:25.000]  gonna happen just by cruise control and that is our dignity as Americans that we
[03:02:25.000 --> 03:02:29.320]  chart our own destiny we don't give it to others to do that well you're
[03:02:29.320 --> 03:02:33.800]  absolutely right I I look at the Texas legislature in this TSA groping
[03:02:33.800 --> 03:02:38.600]  unanimous in the House the Senate didn't want to vote to be made so they let
[03:02:38.600 --> 03:02:44.480]  the lieutenant governor basically spike it because they were gonna pass it 30 to
[03:02:44.480 --> 03:02:50.240]  31 and so suddenly the bill just got withdrawn because of this cowardice they
[03:02:50.240 --> 03:02:54.600]  never want to have a public position they just want to go with the flow and
[03:02:54.600 --> 03:02:58.640]  we're taught that that's what a statesman is is that not historically the
[03:02:58.640 --> 03:03:02.640]  opposite of a statesman well that is right it's what the Dante in his
[03:03:02.640 --> 03:03:07.440]  infirm he writes that that these are the worst places in hell are reserved to
[03:03:07.440 --> 03:03:11.840]  those statesmen in times of great moral crisis who declare their neutrality
[03:03:11.840 --> 03:03:14.880]  you know and that's what these people need to remember if they think that
[03:03:14.880 --> 03:03:17.760]  they're gonna go down when some kind of pedestal or make their way to Mount
[03:03:17.760 --> 03:03:21.360]  Rushmore you know ducking their responsibility like that is the opposite
[03:03:21.360 --> 03:03:25.920]  of what a statement is they are the kinds of people who were there when the
[03:03:25.920 --> 03:03:31.560]  Rubicon was passed in the Roman Republic fell into the Roman Empire and we're
[03:03:31.560 --> 03:03:34.880]  not gonna have to wait a couple hundred years for the Empire to get really bad
[03:03:34.880 --> 03:03:40.080]  I mean look at the where do you see us economically I mean it's unsustainable
[03:03:40.080 --> 03:03:43.720]  we cannot we cannot continue to live this way right just think of this this
[03:03:43.720 --> 03:03:48.000]  would be truly frightening to your audience we now with a fourteen point
[03:03:48.000 --> 03:03:52.840]  three trillion dollar national debt pay and a risk interest with interest rates
[03:03:52.840 --> 03:03:57.120]  about zero of close to five hundred billion dollars when the interest rate
[03:03:57.120 --> 03:04:01.040]  goes from zero to five percent now we're playing interest of three trillion
[03:04:01.040 --> 03:04:04.720]  dollars it is our entire budget is going to be paying interest on the debt this
[03:04:04.720 --> 03:04:09.360]  cannot be sustained it cannot and now standard and pours says we're getting
[03:04:09.360 --> 03:04:13.040]  ready to lose the AAA rating which is exactly what these big mega banks have
[03:04:13.040 --> 03:04:17.480]  been wanting yes and they'll they'll charge more interest by your treasury
[03:04:17.480 --> 03:04:21.480]  bills and securities and it'll come out of our tax money and what we've got to
[03:04:21.480 --> 03:04:25.520]  do we can take probably save a trillion dollars on our 1.2 trillion dollar
[03:04:25.520 --> 03:04:29.120]  national security budget we've got to take more responsibility for our health
[03:04:29.120 --> 03:04:33.040]  for all the provisions in every health care combined if we were just
[03:04:33.040 --> 03:04:36.600]  responsible for a sensible diet and sensible exercise regime we could
[03:04:36.600 --> 03:04:40.400]  probably save the country their trillions of dollars without having a
[03:04:40.400 --> 03:04:45.120]  single law there it all goes back to personal it all goes back to bill yeah
[03:04:45.120 --> 03:04:49.560]  Bruce fine constitutional law scholar thank you so much for spending time with
[03:04:49.560 --> 03:04:54.040]  us all right listen have a great day you too all right great job of the crew
