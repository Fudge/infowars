[00:00.000 --> 00:22.040]  I know that there's a lot of different political ideas and political systems out there in the
[00:22.040 --> 00:23.040]  world.
[00:23.040 --> 00:28.880]  You see, what I do is I actually study with the mega corporations and the big banks and
[00:28.880 --> 00:32.200]  the robber baron, dynasties actually believe in and are up to.
[00:32.200 --> 00:35.320]  So that's the reason world leaders listen to this show.
[00:35.320 --> 00:38.800]  It's the reason all the major intelligence agencies listen to the broadcast.
[00:38.800 --> 00:44.280]  It's the reason that millions of people, despite all the hurdles, come here every day because
[00:44.280 --> 00:46.560]  I know what I'm talking about.
[00:46.560 --> 00:48.760]  Our guests know what they're talking about.
[00:48.760 --> 00:51.200]  Our callers know what they're talking about.
[00:51.200 --> 00:53.040]  And this is real and this is unfiltered.
[00:53.040 --> 00:59.720]  Now it has now officially come out, not just in Australia, not just the UK, but now the
[00:59.720 --> 01:04.640]  US has come out the State Department and confirmed they knew they were doing bio weapons development
[01:04.640 --> 01:07.000]  of coronaviruses at that lab.
[01:07.000 --> 01:09.200]  Now that's old news.
[01:09.200 --> 01:12.360]  Now it's confirmed mainstream.
[01:12.360 --> 01:18.480]  You know what that means.
[01:18.480 --> 01:25.000]  That means the deep States losing their war against America because when even the official
[01:25.000 --> 01:28.960]  mouthpieces start telling the truth more and more of the time, it's kind of like an old
[01:28.960 --> 01:29.960]  car.
[01:29.960 --> 01:34.660]  We only got eight cylinders and three or four kind of start up than five, six and all eight
[01:34.660 --> 01:38.160]  start going in the black smoke, so you'd stop the back and the engine starts running.
[01:38.160 --> 01:43.600]  You know, you've got this old, old hunk of junk starting to move down the road again.
[01:43.600 --> 01:44.800]  And that's where we are.
[01:44.800 --> 01:47.520]  And there's black smoke coming out, baby, and the engines clattering.
[01:47.520 --> 01:54.600]  But the more we drive, the smoother it's starting to go.
[01:54.600 --> 01:55.800]  Now that doesn't mean we're out of the woods.
[01:55.800 --> 01:56.800]  The damn engine could blow.
[01:56.800 --> 02:02.080]  We could throw a rod any minute, but at least we're not dead in the mud up to our axles
[02:02.080 --> 02:05.600]  sitting there taking it.
[02:05.600 --> 02:12.000]  This old girl, this Republic, it's got a lot of heart and they may have brainwashed
[02:12.000 --> 02:17.040]  and put a lot of people into a trance, but I'm telling you, the spirit of 1776 is coming
[02:17.040 --> 02:18.520]  back and I could feel it.
[02:18.520 --> 02:22.400]  And that's why the enemies running around like a bunch of zombies on deck, like a bunch
[02:22.400 --> 02:26.680]  of chickens with their heads cut off, trying to demoralize us and trying to steal everything,
[02:26.680 --> 02:31.000]  not nail down and trying to kill as many people as they can and trying to just absolutely
[02:31.000 --> 02:35.160]  exercise evil in front of us so that we give up to demoralize us.
[02:35.160 --> 02:39.360]  And the only thing we have to fear is letting these people demoralize us.
[02:39.360 --> 02:41.200]  And believe me, I see the evil.
[02:41.200 --> 02:42.200]  It upsets me.
[02:42.200 --> 02:43.200]  I get down.
[02:43.200 --> 02:47.040]  And the answer is I was praying hard this morning woke up at four a.m. and God just
[02:47.040 --> 02:52.000]  said, be positive, talk about the positive and talk about what unifies us because that's
[02:52.000 --> 02:55.880]  why they're pushing all this race war stuff all over the nose and using an example of
[02:55.880 --> 03:02.800]  a cop that doesn't know what he's doing, looks sadistic, sitting on a guy's neck for fun
[03:02.800 --> 03:05.400]  and kills the poor guy.
[03:05.400 --> 03:08.960]  And you can see that humanity is somebody begging for air for eight minutes than dying
[03:08.960 --> 03:11.320]  and all of us feel for that man.
[03:11.320 --> 03:16.160]  I don't care if he's black or white, there's been similar cases of white cops sitting on
[03:16.160 --> 03:19.240]  top white guys heads while they beg and say, I can't breathe.
[03:19.240 --> 03:22.080]  It's terrible footage and the officer is an idiot.
[03:22.080 --> 03:23.960]  It doesn't have this knee on the guy's head.
[03:23.960 --> 03:26.600]  He has it on his carotid artery.
[03:26.600 --> 03:27.640]  You block just one of those.
[03:27.640 --> 03:30.080]  You kill somebody.
[03:30.080 --> 03:31.200]  It's torturous, by the way.
[03:31.200 --> 03:32.200]  One is open.
[03:32.200 --> 03:35.400]  He's getting air on this, this, this artery, but the other side's not getting it.
[03:35.400 --> 03:37.360]  That's why you talk about eight minutes of torture.
[03:37.360 --> 03:40.320]  That guy like, I can't breathe.
[03:40.320 --> 03:41.640]  One side's locked up.
[03:41.640 --> 03:42.640]  You're out.
[03:42.640 --> 03:43.640]  The other side's getting you a blood.
[03:43.640 --> 03:47.520]  Man, that is painful, I'm told.
[03:47.520 --> 03:51.520]  So yeah, watching somebody torture to death, if you have any empathy, you don't like it.
[03:51.520 --> 03:55.960]  Kind of like all the people dying in nursing homes with tubes down their lungs, blowing
[03:55.960 --> 04:01.000]  their lungs up, black, white, old, young, being killed, or crazy COVID patients that
[04:01.000 --> 04:04.080]  are black, beaten up, white patients and vice versa.
[04:04.080 --> 04:09.400]  It's all going on because we're an evil, fallen country.
[04:09.400 --> 04:13.360]  Not everybody, but in general.
[04:13.360 --> 04:20.960]  And so you can look at those images and then look at all the idiot images of people burning
[04:20.960 --> 04:25.480]  down targets and beating up old white ladies because they're white.
[04:25.480 --> 04:26.800]  It's all stupid.
[04:26.800 --> 04:30.960]  It's all ignorance and the people perish for lack of knowledge.
[04:30.960 --> 04:36.440]  Burning down, targeting, beating up an old white lady and going to bring that guy back.
[04:36.440 --> 04:41.720]  We have to transcend this or the globalists are going to win it.
[04:41.720 --> 04:44.160]  They're coming after everybody.
[04:44.160 --> 04:49.680]  So we've got huge news when we return, but yeah, you got LA's on fire, Minneapolis is
[04:49.680 --> 04:50.680]  on fire.
[04:50.680 --> 04:59.840]  I mean, it is all happening right now, just like the globalist wants to stay with us.
[04:59.840 --> 05:06.400]  As I record this announcement, there's only one week left in the biggest sale yet of 2020.
[05:06.400 --> 05:11.840]  We will not have this sale that's going on right now in May until our Christmas sale
[05:11.840 --> 05:12.840]  comes up.
[05:12.840 --> 05:19.840]  All of our best selling supplements are 30 to 60% off at infowarstore.com.
[05:19.840 --> 05:22.040]  Let me just hone in on one of the products.
[05:22.040 --> 05:24.040]  DNA Force Plus.
[05:24.040 --> 05:29.160]  It's got high quality PQQ, CoQ10, and a bunch of other natural ingredients that are known
[05:29.160 --> 05:31.640]  to supercharge the effects of that.
[05:31.640 --> 05:37.160]  Learn what PQQ and CoQ10 can do for you, no matter how old you are, no matter what color
[05:37.160 --> 05:42.000]  you are, no matter where you live in the world, it works the same on everybody.
[05:42.000 --> 05:44.560]  It's known to be able to regrow nerves.
[05:44.560 --> 05:47.960]  It's designed so that your telomeres last longer.
[05:47.960 --> 05:52.520]  Doesn't make them grow, makes them shrink slower, which is basically the same thing.
[05:52.520 --> 06:07.400]  DNA Force Plus is 50% off for a limited time at infowarstore.com.
[06:07.400 --> 06:08.400]  The quickening.
[06:08.400 --> 06:17.800]  That's an ancient term for forms of singularities, and time is now compressing.
[06:17.800 --> 06:21.680]  What is going to happen in the next month is going to be more important than having the
[06:21.680 --> 06:29.840]  last 10 years, and then it compresses more and more and more and more and more and more
[06:29.840 --> 06:35.560]  and more as we accelerate into the future.
[06:35.560 --> 06:42.040]  Every action you take now will determine the course of not just you and your family, but
[06:42.040 --> 06:48.360]  the entire species, and the ultimate destiny that Satan believes he can block.
[06:48.360 --> 06:53.000]  If Satan will be removed from the doorway, we will enter.
[06:53.000 --> 06:57.160]  We will go to the next level, but some will not go with us.
[06:57.160 --> 06:59.200]  This is the Great Quest.
[06:59.200 --> 07:04.280]  Yet behind me, Satan, only that can free us.
[07:04.280 --> 07:08.360]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, it is Thursday, May 28th.
[07:08.360 --> 07:10.680]  The year is 2020.
[07:10.680 --> 07:11.680]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[07:11.680 --> 07:15.240]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours ahead of the war room with Owen Schreuer
[07:15.240 --> 07:18.840]  with Savannah Hernandez and Harrison Smith that have been sitting and doing an excellent
[07:18.840 --> 07:23.760]  job while Owen takes some well-preserved time off to visit his family back in the show me
[07:23.760 --> 07:29.840]  state of Missouri.
[07:29.840 --> 07:30.840]  Let me just do this.
[07:30.840 --> 07:36.720]  I've got about 50 of these clips, but let's just play for TV and radio listeners.
[07:36.720 --> 07:42.520]  Four or five clips of the looting and the rioting and the racial attacks on white people in LA
[07:42.520 --> 07:48.960]  and in Minnesota, in California, in the main city of LA, in Minnesota, in the main city
[07:48.960 --> 07:53.680]  of Minneapolis, St. Paul, and just the idiocy of all of this.
[07:53.680 --> 08:00.360]  It's not going to bring back the poor man that out of control police officer killed.
[08:00.360 --> 08:01.840]  And the police officer has been fired.
[08:01.840 --> 08:04.120]  He's going to get indicted.
[08:04.120 --> 08:09.920]  And you know, he should.
[08:09.920 --> 08:15.760]  Because you can't, you can't just sit there and put your knee on somebody's crowded
[08:15.760 --> 08:20.760]  artery and not know they're going to die.
[08:20.760 --> 08:22.120]  They're going to die.
[08:22.120 --> 08:26.800]  And so, okay, you didn't know that manslaughter.
[08:26.800 --> 08:31.280]  But in general said that the police are doing this, the police are acting like this.
[08:31.280 --> 08:32.280]  That is just ignorant.
[08:32.280 --> 08:34.520]  And it's not about a defense of the police.
[08:34.520 --> 08:40.800]  It's about the mainstream media and the corporate culture trying to get us all to fight with
[08:40.800 --> 08:44.720]  each other at this critical point with 150 days out from the election.
[08:44.720 --> 08:49.600]  While Trump undoubtedly is trying to heal racial wounds and unify America and empower
[08:49.600 --> 08:53.520]  the average American, the Democrats don't want people off the plantation, whether they
[08:53.520 --> 08:57.280]  be white, black, Hispanic, old, young, male, female, gay, straight.
[08:57.280 --> 09:00.080]  So you know what I actually want to air right now?
[09:00.080 --> 09:07.520]  Let's air a few minutes of the last minutes of George Floyd's life that has touched so
[09:07.520 --> 09:11.320]  many people's hearts and really should.
[09:11.320 --> 09:16.920]  Let's humanize this man who, okay, somebody thought he was passing fake 20s.
[09:16.920 --> 09:20.400]  Is that a death sentence handed out on the side of the road?
[09:20.400 --> 09:21.400]  No.
[09:21.400 --> 09:26.760]  And I'm glad people have some humanity when they see somebody pinned down, begging for
[09:26.760 --> 09:31.160]  their life, dying, and somebody callously, ignorantly killing him because I guarantee
[09:31.160 --> 09:33.800]  you that cop didn't know he was killing him.
[09:33.800 --> 09:38.680]  That dumbass doesn't know about anatomy.
[09:38.680 --> 09:44.800]  You got the guy's head turned to the side, your knees right on his carotid artery, bubba.
[09:44.800 --> 09:47.040]  You think that cop wondered what's about to happen to him?
[09:47.040 --> 09:48.040]  No.
[09:48.040 --> 09:49.760]  He's a dumbass like so many other people.
[09:49.760 --> 09:50.760]  They're dumb cops.
[09:50.760 --> 09:51.760]  They're good cops.
[09:51.760 --> 09:52.760]  They're dumb doctors.
[09:52.760 --> 09:53.760]  There's good doctors.
[09:53.760 --> 09:58.880]  There's bad, evil people, and there's good people, but that's not somebody being evil.
[09:58.880 --> 10:01.280]  That's somebody being a bully, dumbass.
[10:01.280 --> 10:06.040]  You can see he's enjoying it sitting there like he's in charge.
[10:06.040 --> 10:13.880]  And really all he's doing is burning his whole life up along with George Floyd's.
[10:13.880 --> 10:18.040]  So let's play a little bit of that and then I'll tell you all the stuff that's coming
[10:18.040 --> 10:19.040]  up.
[10:19.040 --> 10:24.640]  George Floyd's vaccines got shut down, making people sick and killing the monkeys that they
[10:24.640 --> 10:25.640]  tried it on.
[10:25.640 --> 10:30.840]  But he's got other vaccines that have passed animal trials right to humans.
[10:30.840 --> 10:31.840]  So that's all coming up.
[10:31.840 --> 10:32.840]  There's so much.
[10:32.840 --> 10:34.440]  Trump's announced a big executive order.
[10:34.440 --> 10:35.440]  We got a draft of it.
[10:35.440 --> 10:37.840]  I can't believe nobody's covering the draft.
[10:37.840 --> 10:38.840]  They're going after him.
[10:38.840 --> 10:42.120]  You know, this is some good news because it's not about censorship.
[10:42.120 --> 10:49.160]  It's about bullying, and dominating, and election meddling, and riding herd on the American
[10:49.160 --> 10:50.160]  people.
[10:50.160 --> 10:52.640]  And the global is another to lose.
[10:52.640 --> 10:56.640]  And so Trump's acquiescence is green lit, incredibly criminal activity.
[10:56.640 --> 11:00.800]  So Trump can go after him on the censorship front, but that's not the one.
[11:00.800 --> 11:03.480]  It's the espionage front.
[11:03.480 --> 11:07.480]  That's where you can really skin the Google cat and the rest of them.
[11:07.480 --> 11:15.920]  And let's go to the man, George Floyd, begging for his life with an idiot who doesn't know
[11:15.920 --> 11:19.480]  that when you put your full weight down on the side of somebody's neck that you kill
[11:19.480 --> 11:20.480]  him.
[11:20.480 --> 11:23.480]  Here's how to be an idiot right here.
[11:23.480 --> 11:41.480]  My stomach hurts, my neck hurts, everything hurts, there's water, something, please, please,
[11:41.480 --> 11:49.480]  I can't breathe, I can't breathe, I can't breathe, I can't breathe, I can't breathe,
[11:49.480 --> 11:50.480]  I can't breathe.
[11:50.480 --> 11:55.320]  Like a tough guy.
[11:55.320 --> 12:09.680]  Tough guy, he's not even resisting the rest, man.
[12:09.680 --> 12:19.100]  Let me see a pulse.
[12:19.100 --> 12:20.600]  Is he breathing right now?
[12:20.600 --> 12:21.600]  Check his pulse.
[12:21.600 --> 12:23.600]  Check his pulse.
[12:23.600 --> 12:24.600]  Check his pulse, pal.
[12:24.600 --> 12:25.600]  I'm telling you right now.
[12:25.600 --> 12:26.600]  Check his pulse.
[12:26.600 --> 12:27.600]  Tell him.
[12:27.600 --> 12:28.600]  Check his pulse, bro.
[12:28.600 --> 12:29.600]  What do you guys do?
[12:29.600 --> 12:30.600]  Bro, check his pulse, bro.
[12:30.600 --> 12:31.600]  You don't do drugs, guys.
[12:31.600 --> 12:32.600]  Don't do drugs, bro.
[12:32.600 --> 12:33.600]  What is that?
[12:33.600 --> 12:34.600]  What do you think that is?
[12:34.600 --> 12:35.600]  You saw you call.
[12:35.600 --> 12:36.600]  Were you doing okay?
[12:36.600 --> 12:37.600]  Get back on the streets.
[12:37.600 --> 12:38.600]  You called.
[12:38.600 --> 12:39.600]  Were you doing okay?
[12:39.600 --> 12:40.600]  Get off of his neck.
[12:40.600 --> 12:41.600]  You're still on him.
[12:41.600 --> 12:43.600]  Bro, get back on the street.
[12:43.600 --> 12:44.600]  Are you serious?
[12:44.600 --> 12:45.600]  Bro, are you serious?
[12:45.600 --> 12:50.600]  And you're going to keep your, you're going to keep your, you're going to keep your, you're
[12:50.600 --> 12:51.600]  going to neck?
[12:51.600 --> 12:52.600]  Man, bro.
[12:52.600 --> 12:53.600]  I'm going to first respond to him.
[12:53.600 --> 12:58.600]  The bad thing you guys are in checking his pulse and doing compression if he needs
[12:58.600 --> 13:00.600]  that, you guys are on and up and back.
[13:00.600 --> 13:01.600]  Oh my God.
[13:01.600 --> 13:02.600]  Okay.
[13:02.600 --> 13:03.600]  They didn't drag him.
[13:03.600 --> 13:04.600]  Come on down.
[13:04.600 --> 13:13.480]  So you just watched a public execution.
[13:13.480 --> 13:21.160]  You just watched him kill a man.
[13:21.160 --> 13:28.200]  Now I want you to take what you just saw and I want you to think about the 56,000 people
[13:28.200 --> 13:35.200]  that were black, white, old, young, but mainly old in hospitals being murdered by them bringing
[13:35.200 --> 13:39.720]  in COVID-19 patients on purpose and then sticking a hose down their neck and blowing
[13:39.720 --> 13:41.760]  their lungs up to get money.
[13:41.760 --> 13:44.640]  And all the doctors telling them, don't do this, it's a death sentence and they ordered
[13:44.640 --> 13:47.760]  it in four states, the majority of the deaths.
[13:47.760 --> 13:51.660]  Oh, but you, there's no video of that.
[13:51.660 --> 13:57.160]  People fighting to not have that run down their lungs and taking days to die.
[13:57.160 --> 13:59.840]  Not as painfully as you just saw that poor man die.
[13:59.840 --> 14:01.000]  So you think about that.
[14:01.000 --> 14:03.240]  That's why Stalin said one man dies.
[14:03.240 --> 14:04.240]  It's a tragedy.
[14:04.240 --> 14:05.240]  10,000 died.
[14:05.240 --> 14:06.240]  It's a statistic.
[14:06.240 --> 14:07.400]  So see, I'm pissed off.
[14:07.400 --> 14:13.760]  I'm ready to burn stuff down, but not target and I'm not going to burn anything down.
[14:13.760 --> 14:17.800]  But let me tell you, I get being pissed because I can visualize what's going on those hospitals.
[14:17.800 --> 14:20.280]  I can see it without being shown it.
[14:20.280 --> 14:23.280]  That's why they made it all secret inside the hospitals and secret inside the nursing
[14:23.280 --> 14:27.520]  homes where they're in there killing people right now and they know exactly what they're
[14:27.520 --> 14:28.960]  doing in Bill Gates Bragg's.
[14:28.960 --> 14:31.200]  Hey, there's too many people.
[14:31.200 --> 14:33.840]  They think it's funny.
[14:33.840 --> 14:37.040]  And then they're going to use those deaths to take all of our freedoms and bankrupt
[14:37.040 --> 14:40.240]  our economy.
[14:40.240 --> 14:46.800]  And they're going to show us the footage that they cherry pick of that police officer committing
[14:46.800 --> 14:47.800]  manslaughter.
[14:47.800 --> 14:54.440]  Man slaughter, again, is when you kill somebody, but didn't intend to.
[14:54.440 --> 15:01.120]  And that dumbass cop did not know he was killing him and I'm not defending him.
[15:01.120 --> 15:06.960]  His ignorance is almost worse than knowing he was going to do it because with great
[15:06.960 --> 15:11.240]  power comes great responsibility.
[15:11.240 --> 15:17.280]  And we have to empathize for everybody that dies.
[15:17.280 --> 15:21.040]  So I want you to now think about the 62 million babies we've killed, the tens of millions
[15:21.040 --> 15:23.840]  that have been kept alive and harvested after they're born.
[15:23.840 --> 15:27.840]  And I want you to think about them because they don't have voices to speak out.
[15:27.840 --> 15:31.280]  So yeah, be upset about George Floyd.
[15:31.280 --> 15:32.280]  Have empathy.
[15:32.280 --> 15:33.280]  That's good.
[15:33.280 --> 15:39.680]  But you think about all those old people and all those babies and you ask, where are
[15:39.680 --> 15:41.480]  the people pissed and upset about that?
[15:41.480 --> 15:43.120]  And where's the targeted action?
[15:43.120 --> 15:48.360]  And I'm not calling for targeted action, but you go burn down target because a bad cop
[15:48.360 --> 15:50.040]  killed a black guy.
[15:50.040 --> 15:53.240]  What about the people killing all the old folks and killing the babies?
[15:53.240 --> 15:57.520]  They're the ones that think they're getting away with it all.
[15:57.520 --> 16:00.120]  The United States is not communist China.
[16:00.120 --> 16:03.080]  We don't have three million people in concentration camps.
[16:03.080 --> 16:04.960]  We don't blow up churches.
[16:04.960 --> 16:08.160]  We don't kill political dissidents and sell their organs.
[16:08.160 --> 16:14.360]  But all over the news, we see the U.N., billable indicates, WHO, mainstream corporate media
[16:14.360 --> 16:17.480]  praising communist China for their response.
[16:17.480 --> 16:21.720]  And if communist China shoots women at checkpoints and welds people into their houses and has
[16:21.720 --> 16:24.880]  robots controlling people, well, then gee, we've got to do that.
[16:24.880 --> 16:28.960]  And on top of it, cities like San Antonio passed laws saying, we'll arrest you if you
[16:28.960 --> 16:30.440]  say Chinese virus.
[16:30.440 --> 16:34.040]  Well, now Cuomo in New York is calling it the European virus.
[16:34.040 --> 16:39.240]  These people are out of control, control freaks, and they are going to lose big time because
[16:39.240 --> 16:43.200]  we the people are aware of their criminal activities and are exposing them in their
[16:43.200 --> 16:44.200]  power grab.
[16:44.200 --> 16:48.640]  The Resistance lives at band.video and infowars.com.
[16:48.640 --> 16:52.640]  Spread those links and jam it down the censors' throats, and then we'll be able to defeat

[17:58.960 --> 18:20.440]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:20.440 --> 18:26.080]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[18:26.080 --> 18:30.800]  Evil is now throwing its full weight on humanity.
[18:30.800 --> 18:35.600]  Every trick to divide us, every trick to make us hate each other, every trick to make us
[18:35.600 --> 18:42.080]  kill each other, every trick to make us forget God and give up on hope is being thrown against
[18:42.080 --> 18:43.080]  us.
[18:43.080 --> 18:45.480]  And it's only the beginning.
[18:45.480 --> 18:46.480]  Here's the good news.
[18:46.480 --> 18:50.200]  The universe is made by God.
[18:50.200 --> 18:52.920]  For every action, there's an opposite and equal reaction.
[18:52.920 --> 18:55.440]  Newtonian physics is true.
[18:55.440 --> 19:04.880]  Even so, rejoice, my friends, because as you see great evil manifesting, know that God
[19:04.880 --> 19:08.240]  is coming into the world even stronger.
[19:08.240 --> 19:13.800]  But we have to receive that power and ask God to be our defender.
[19:13.800 --> 19:15.240]  You can't do it yourselves.
[19:15.240 --> 19:17.600]  You have to ask God to leave God and direct you.
[19:17.600 --> 19:21.120]  But then you've got to decide you're willing to confront people that are doing evil and
[19:21.120 --> 19:22.520]  getting their face.
[19:22.520 --> 19:28.960]  It's not because you enjoy it, it's because you have to do it.
[19:28.960 --> 19:33.760]  So if you're not speaking up and if you're not standing up, you're dying.
[19:33.760 --> 19:36.160]  All right, let me just do this.
[19:36.160 --> 19:40.840]  And I try this for 20-something years on air and I can never get to it.
[19:40.840 --> 19:43.520]  First five or six years on air, I was kind of good at having my stack of news.
[19:43.520 --> 19:48.720]  My newspapers, I'd go get at the local newspaper shop that had like 20 newspapers from around
[19:48.720 --> 19:49.720]  the country.
[19:49.720 --> 19:50.720]  I'd have to pay a lot of money for them.
[19:50.720 --> 19:55.760]  I'd have the old-fashioned newsstands where you can get all the newspapers.
[19:55.760 --> 19:58.080]  And I'd have all my stacks and ready and I'd mention everything.
[19:58.080 --> 20:02.800]  I was going to cover at the start of the show, but it's been probably 20 years since I ever
[20:02.800 --> 20:06.160]  actually listed even 10% of what I was looking at.
[20:06.160 --> 20:10.240]  Let me just list some of it right now.
[20:10.240 --> 20:14.920]  Bill Gates had his testing facility with fake COVID-19 tests where everybody was positive
[20:14.920 --> 20:18.400]  by the way, of course, to create the hysteria.
[20:18.400 --> 20:20.760]  That got shut down a week ago by the FDA.
[20:20.760 --> 20:27.880]  Well, you know, raided by them, not just demonized politically, like we've been.
[20:27.880 --> 20:33.320]  Another Gates vaccine bites the dust, sick monkeys everywhere, he experiences a severe
[20:33.320 --> 20:36.680]  reaction to Madera's COVID-19 vaccine candidate.
[20:36.680 --> 20:38.440]  He's still a believer though.
[20:38.440 --> 20:44.160]  So we've got all that coming up.
[20:44.160 --> 20:49.880]  First of President Trump's social media censorship executive order, we've got that.
[20:49.880 --> 20:55.320]  That's up at infowars.com.
[20:55.320 --> 21:00.960]  And how Trump is planning with 158 days out, try to stop this, he prepares his executive
[21:00.960 --> 21:01.960]  order.
[21:01.960 --> 21:08.120]  We've got Josh Hawley in Congress pointing out that big tech basically works for the
[21:08.120 --> 21:09.320]  Chinese.
[21:09.320 --> 21:11.880]  And see, that's the big enchilada right there.
[21:11.880 --> 21:12.880]  This isn't about censorship.
[21:12.880 --> 21:16.920]  If you can argue all day that private companies can surveil you in real time and the way of
[21:16.920 --> 21:18.280]  your rights, it can censor you.
[21:18.280 --> 21:22.280]  It's immoral, it's evil, it's horrible, but you could argue that in a sick way.
[21:22.280 --> 21:27.280]  But once they work with other companies together to create censorship, that's called racketeering.
[21:27.280 --> 21:30.680]  That's called coordination.
[21:30.680 --> 21:35.280]  But when you work with foreign governments like the Communist Chinese, you take investment
[21:35.280 --> 21:40.360]  money and then you start censoring Americans criticizing the Communist Chinese government,
[21:40.360 --> 21:48.040]  you just became a spy, you just involved yourself in espionage.
[21:48.040 --> 21:51.840]  It's levels above racketeering.
[21:51.840 --> 21:58.560]  So evil is making its move right now.
[21:58.560 --> 22:05.960]  We're going to cover all of that.
[22:05.960 --> 22:08.360]  And then we've got what's really happening with the economy.
[22:08.360 --> 22:14.520]  And we've got all the crazy day two of protests in Minnesota and California and all the buildings
[22:14.520 --> 22:16.000]  burning down.
[22:16.000 --> 22:22.560]  And the State Department cables warning of safety issues at Wuhan lab, that's all coming
[22:22.560 --> 22:23.560]  up now.
[22:23.560 --> 22:30.160]  And German officials say children who don't submit to the COVID-19 health certificates
[22:30.160 --> 22:38.320]  that means forced inoculation will be taken from their parents.
[22:38.320 --> 22:47.440]  We've got Governor Cuomo quietly making it a law that it's a felony in New York if a
[22:47.440 --> 22:55.120]  police officer runs somebody's driver's license, they're giving legal aliens driver's license
[22:55.120 --> 22:59.680]  and the person's a criminal, want it under a federal warrant.
[22:59.680 --> 23:07.640]  If you tell the Feds there's a federal warrant for murder, arson drug, that doesn't matter.
[23:07.640 --> 23:11.720]  You go to jail for 10 years.
[23:11.720 --> 23:20.280]  I mean, you put up with Cuomo, why not, hell, he ordered the nursing homes where the majority
[23:20.280 --> 23:25.280]  of deaths in New York happen to take COVID patients known as a death sentence to jack
[23:25.280 --> 23:29.800]  up the numbers and make up to $53,000 per person they whack.
[23:29.800 --> 23:33.200]  That's a good contract on each old person.
[23:33.200 --> 23:44.200]  And now he is saying that they are going to arrest all the nursing home people because
[23:44.200 --> 23:45.200]  they killed the old folks.
[23:45.200 --> 23:47.800]  See, oh, you're going to complain or do you to kill them?
[23:47.800 --> 23:49.280]  I'm going to put your ass in prison.
[23:49.280 --> 23:55.640]  Oh, and by the way, you pull over somebody and they've got a warrant out for murder for
[23:55.640 --> 24:00.640]  hire, maybe doing some work for old Cuomo or meth dealing, whatever it is.
[24:00.640 --> 24:07.240]  And guess what, if you have a police officer or a magistrate or a constable or anybody
[24:07.240 --> 24:16.320]  tells the Feds you get 10 years in prison, Cuomo's command and people are like, that's
[24:16.320 --> 24:17.320]  outrageous.
[24:17.320 --> 24:20.440]  Well, I mean, he just got away with killing tens of thousands of old people.
[24:20.440 --> 24:26.680]  Why the hell would he stop right there?
[24:26.680 --> 24:28.200]  People go like, why did Hitler do all that?
[24:28.200 --> 24:30.640]  A lot of Stalin do that because they're evil.
[24:30.640 --> 24:35.480]  Take a pit bull, a bad pit bull, eat some three-year-old kid for no reason.
[24:35.480 --> 24:38.120]  Why did that pit bull eat that kid?
[24:38.120 --> 24:41.520]  Because they're evil.
[24:41.520 --> 24:43.440]  They got a screw loose.
[24:43.440 --> 24:45.840]  That's what they do.
[24:45.840 --> 24:50.720]  See, old story of the toad or the frog and it's about to go across the river and the
[24:50.720 --> 24:53.400]  scorpion comes over and says, can I have a ride?
[24:53.400 --> 24:55.920]  And the frog goes, you know, you might sting me.
[24:55.920 --> 24:56.920]  You're a scorpion.
[24:56.920 --> 24:59.840]  He goes, oh, I promise, I'm reformed.
[24:59.840 --> 25:00.840]  I love you.
[25:00.840 --> 25:01.840]  I'm going to be nice.
[25:01.840 --> 25:02.840]  Just carry me across, please.
[25:02.840 --> 25:04.840]  Because he goes, the frog's nice.
[25:04.840 --> 25:08.360]  Frog goes, just climb on the back, put him across, says, all right, thank you.
[25:08.360 --> 25:11.480]  He goes, oh, thank you, pow.
[25:11.480 --> 25:14.480]  And the frog's sitting there dying, oh, why'd you do that?
[25:14.480 --> 25:19.880]  He goes, because I'm a scorpion, dumbass.
[25:19.880 --> 25:30.560]  And the governor of California and the governor of Pennsylvania and the governor of New York,
[25:30.560 --> 25:36.840]  the governor of California, Michigan, New York and Pennsylvania, they want brownie points
[25:36.840 --> 25:41.720]  to be president later that they would send COVID patients when all the doctors say it's
[25:41.720 --> 25:45.240]  a death sentence to kill people by the tens of thousands.
[25:45.240 --> 25:49.960]  They want to show just like the Mexican mafia or MS-13 will go kidnap a seven-year-old girl
[25:49.960 --> 25:53.600]  and rape her and carve pentagrams in her and then slit her throat and then put her head
[25:53.600 --> 25:54.800]  on their mom's porch.
[25:54.800 --> 25:55.800]  You go, why would you do that?
[25:55.800 --> 26:00.360]  Because these little low-level gangbangers want to prove to the capos that, man, I will
[26:00.360 --> 26:05.560]  kidnap a girl out of their backyard and I will carve pentagrams in her while I rape
[26:05.560 --> 26:11.040]  her and I will chop her head off and I will put it on the front porch of their mama as
[26:11.040 --> 26:14.040]  an offering to Satan, which means to the gang leader.
[26:14.040 --> 26:24.440]  MS-13 doesn't have nothing on Newsome and on Cuomo and on Wolf and on all these people.
[26:24.440 --> 26:27.240]  Don't you get it?
[26:27.240 --> 26:29.360]  Don't you understand that?
[26:29.360 --> 26:31.840]  They killed all those low people, not for that money.
[26:31.840 --> 26:37.360]  They killed them to get off on it and show everybody that they can kill people.
[26:37.360 --> 26:42.320]  People they get control of just like that psycho chicken leg, chicken armed cop, you
[26:42.320 --> 26:44.360]  know, getting off on killing that dude.
[26:44.360 --> 26:46.720]  It's the power to do it.
[26:46.720 --> 26:47.720]  That's what they want.
[26:47.720 --> 26:50.720]  It's spiritual and it's evil.
[26:50.720 --> 26:53.960]  But right back stay with us.
[26:53.960 --> 26:57.080]  The lockdown is permanent dictatorship.
[26:57.080 --> 27:03.600]  The lockdown is designed to have the public accept their basic rights being suspended
[27:03.600 --> 27:09.960]  and a global medical tyranny led by the WHO and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
[27:09.960 --> 27:11.960]  in full control.
[27:11.960 --> 27:14.120]  Many will submit through fear.
[27:14.120 --> 27:15.120]  Others will be bought off.
[27:15.120 --> 27:21.560]  But in the end, the globalists submit they're building a post-human world and now that we're
[27:21.560 --> 27:28.200]  inside the cage, it's going to move very, very quickly into its end game.
[27:28.200 --> 27:33.800]  Submission to this is a form of living death and committing the next generation and our
[27:33.800 --> 27:40.360]  own generation to a living hell that cannot be imagined until you're actually experiencing
[27:40.360 --> 27:41.360]  this.
[27:41.360 --> 27:46.040]  This is your dignity, your soul, your future being poured inside out.
[27:46.040 --> 27:51.400]  This is a scientific dictatorship taking full control of humanity for its own selfless
[27:51.400 --> 27:53.800]  disgusting power trip.
[27:53.800 --> 27:58.600]  Futilism in the ancient world from Asia to Europe from Africa to Latin America was the
[27:58.600 --> 28:00.840]  most common form of government.
[28:00.840 --> 28:05.680]  You had a ruling class, the nobility, the king and queen sitting on top of it and the
[28:05.680 --> 28:11.480]  rest of the public were kept at a subsistence starving level for control.
[28:11.480 --> 28:15.800]  In fact, in most cultures, they call the peasants the little people because they were usually
[28:15.800 --> 28:22.320]  a foot or more shorter than the lords and ladies because they kept them again at a starving
[28:22.320 --> 28:23.320]  level.
[28:23.320 --> 28:27.480]  They were so busy trying to survive, they would never try to challenge the entrenched
[28:27.480 --> 28:28.480]  elite.
[28:28.480 --> 28:32.560]  Well, now all the big Google owners and the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds, the Jeff
[28:32.560 --> 28:36.760]  Bezos is the world, they're sitting back on their giant estates with their jet helicopters
[28:36.760 --> 28:43.760]  and private jets living the life, laughing at you, shut down, going bankrupt in the third
[28:43.760 --> 28:45.320]  world starving to death.
[28:45.320 --> 28:51.080]  Their religion is power and control and they are pressing that advantage against us.
[28:51.080 --> 28:54.000]  We must break free from these monsters.
[28:54.000 --> 28:55.000]  Memorial Day is here.
[28:55.000 --> 28:59.360]  It's one of the biggest sales of the year and we were already running a huge sale but
[28:59.360 --> 29:02.200]  we're having to end that one because a bunch of items are selling out.
[29:02.200 --> 29:06.840]  But all the items we have left at stock are still on record sale and then five items that
[29:06.840 --> 29:11.000]  weren't on sale that we got back at stock, they're also massively discounted as well
[29:11.000 --> 29:12.720]  for the Memorial Day special.
[29:12.720 --> 29:18.480]  So here it is, super male vitality, 40% off, knockout, the great sleeping, 50% off, Brain
[29:18.480 --> 29:20.840]  Force Plus hadn't been on sale for almost six months.
[29:20.840 --> 29:28.480]  It is 50% off, bio tricillinium, 60% off, shale force, it's incredible, 60% off and
[29:28.480 --> 29:32.120]  you've got all these other items on sale as well until they sell out.
[29:32.120 --> 29:37.400]  So infowarstore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine to get these
[29:37.400 --> 29:40.480]  items and take advantage of this mega sale Memorial Day.
[29:40.480 --> 29:42.320]  Again, thank you all for watching.
[29:42.320 --> 29:46.160]  We appreciate your support, your financial support, but it's also supported you and your
[29:46.160 --> 29:49.080]  family with amazing products that are so good for you and your body.
[29:49.080 --> 29:50.680]  Again, thank you all for your support.
[29:50.680 --> 29:57.600]  We are all in this together.
[29:57.600 --> 30:25.800]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[30:25.800 --> 30:26.800]  We are back live.
[30:26.800 --> 30:27.800]  We are broadcasting worldwide.
[30:27.800 --> 30:28.800]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[30:28.800 --> 30:30.800]  Look at these headlines.
[30:30.800 --> 30:36.480]  CDC mortality counts show more pneumonia deaths than coronavirus deaths while media reported
[30:36.480 --> 30:40.600]  20,000 more deaths than the CDC.
[30:40.600 --> 30:41.600]  Absolute fraud.
[30:41.600 --> 30:46.920]  The CDC slashes the COVID-19 fatality rate to a fraction of early estimates used to justify
[30:46.920 --> 30:50.760]  lockdowns in full wars.com.
[30:50.760 --> 30:56.280]  Full distancing based on high school science fair, Fauci says he wears a mask as a symbol
[30:56.280 --> 31:03.560]  of what you should be doing, a symbol of respect, of subservience.
[31:03.560 --> 31:09.000]  Now he warns about hydroxychloroquine because he's all invested in all the other stuff.
[31:09.000 --> 31:13.960]  Meanwhile, there's footage out of the UK hospital patients complained about where waiting for
[31:13.960 --> 31:18.320]  hours and hours while the national health service get clapped to and shoot hour long
[31:18.320 --> 31:24.560]  TikTok videos, it's all on footage.
[31:24.560 --> 31:29.360]  Meanwhile, college students soon welcome back to campus by virus testing robots, the robot
[31:29.360 --> 31:32.200]  controllers that follow orders are here.
[31:32.200 --> 31:36.600]  Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey stands by decision to fact check Trump when Trump said mail-in
[31:36.600 --> 31:41.120]  ballots are a recipe for disaster, even though all the studies and history show it, the Washington
[31:41.120 --> 31:45.000]  Post said we haven't had the election yet, so there's no proof of that.
[31:45.000 --> 31:51.240]  It's like saying you haven't smoked five packs of cigarettes a day for 10 years to see if
[31:51.240 --> 31:52.240]  it hurts your lungs.
[31:52.240 --> 31:54.520]  You haven't taken cyanide yet to see if it kills you.
[31:54.520 --> 31:56.640]  You haven't poured gasoline on yourself yet and lit it.
[31:56.640 --> 31:59.760]  We know that's false.
[31:59.760 --> 32:03.520]  Having Governor Newsom and all the rest of them mail out ballots to everybody and have
[32:03.520 --> 32:07.600]  no proof that it's even real or let people have fake ballots, that's totally normal.
[32:07.600 --> 32:09.080]  There's nothing to see here.
[32:09.080 --> 32:11.840]  Jack Dorsey, he has a little beard.
[32:11.840 --> 32:15.400]  He said so.
[32:15.400 --> 32:20.240]  Beijing overwhelmingly passes a lot of crush to sit in Hong Kong, hails coronavirus as
[32:20.240 --> 32:21.960]  it would turn the tide.
[32:21.960 --> 32:24.160]  That ol' coronavirus sure helped, didn't it?
[32:24.160 --> 32:29.680]  Los Angeles, when schools open, students must wear masks, eat a loaded classroom, self-isolate
[32:29.680 --> 32:32.200]  at recess, and they say it's never ending.
[32:32.200 --> 32:36.560]  Like Fauci said, you'll never shake hands again, you'll always wear a mask as a symbol
[32:36.560 --> 32:40.680]  of your bondage to the new world order and build upon the gate's endless vaccines.
[32:40.680 --> 32:46.360]  In fact, there's a graphic down on the lower right-hand side of infowars.com.
[32:46.360 --> 32:49.480]  Can we go pull that up?
[32:49.480 --> 32:55.400]  It's today's cartoon of the new sheeple person, and it shows all the things they're announcing.
[32:55.400 --> 32:56.920]  It's not even a joke.
[32:56.920 --> 33:03.520]  Tracker chips and bracelets and forced inoculations, I mean, that's really where we are.
[33:03.520 --> 33:08.840]  But don't worry, Disney World, to reopen in July with high-energy squads roaming park
[33:08.840 --> 33:10.760]  to make sure people wear masks.
[33:10.760 --> 33:12.600]  Boy, that sure makes me want to go.
[33:12.600 --> 33:13.600]  Yeah, there it is.
[33:13.600 --> 33:16.200]  Let's put it on screen, please.
[33:16.200 --> 33:19.440]  Sheeple of the new normal.
[33:19.440 --> 33:23.800]  You have a brain blocker, you have a satellite tracking, you have a muzzle mask, you have
[33:23.800 --> 33:31.920]  a chip implant COVID-1984, social distancing, you remove the gender, endless vaccines, mandatory
[33:31.920 --> 33:37.440]  phone tracking, vaccine ID, travel license, social score, digital wallet, you have a rubber
[33:37.440 --> 33:40.040]  spine.
[33:40.040 --> 33:41.920]  Isn't that wonderful?
[33:41.920 --> 33:45.160]  That's the new Uber mention.
[33:45.160 --> 33:52.800]  Meanwhile, German schools threaten to abduct kids who show up to school without health certificates,
[33:52.800 --> 33:57.080]  and they say that by the end of the year, next year, that means forced inoculation.
[33:57.080 --> 34:00.360]  To get the health certificate, they say you'll have to have the new phone that tracks you
[34:00.360 --> 34:03.280]  and the digital health certificate that you've been vaccinated.
[34:03.280 --> 34:08.680]  So, translate the headline, German officials prepare to take children from parents who don't
[34:08.680 --> 34:12.120]  accept Bill's gift of death.
[34:12.120 --> 34:20.720]  And speaking of Bill Gates's loving little gifties, another Gates vaccine bites the dust.
[34:20.720 --> 34:22.560]  Sick monkeys everywhere.
[34:22.560 --> 34:27.240]  Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., chairman of the Children's Health Defense.
[34:27.240 --> 34:28.240]  And it's in the news.
[34:28.240 --> 34:29.960]  It was announced yesterday.
[34:29.960 --> 34:33.840]  Last week, they shut down his testing company because they had fraud going on.
[34:33.840 --> 34:42.600]  Well, now, ladies and gentlemen, they've had the monkeys getting sick and dying, a 20%
[34:42.600 --> 34:43.600]  rate.
[34:43.600 --> 34:50.240]  So, Bill Gates had said, oh, one in 10,000 will have an adverse reaction, so we'll have
[34:50.240 --> 34:55.600]  700,000 people get sick or die.
[34:55.600 --> 34:58.200]  But 20% is not one out of 10,000.
[34:58.200 --> 34:59.200]  It's 20%.
[34:59.200 --> 35:01.360]  So, let's do the math.
[35:01.360 --> 35:02.360]  We have 7.5 billion people.
[35:02.360 --> 35:04.480]  Can we do the math on the calculator, guys?
[35:04.480 --> 35:09.040]  7.5 billion people and 20% haven't had an adverse reaction.
[35:09.040 --> 35:13.400]  What's 20% of 7.5 billion people?
[35:13.400 --> 35:17.640]  We all know the math, don't we?
[35:17.640 --> 35:23.640]  It's 700 plus million people.
[35:23.640 --> 35:30.680]  It's even higher than that.
[35:30.680 --> 35:31.680]  Let's do the math here.
[35:31.680 --> 35:36.280]  I'll pull it up on my phone right here, on my little digital tracker beast system that
[35:36.280 --> 35:42.160]  loves me so much and cares about me so much and is always there to help me.
[35:42.160 --> 35:44.160]  750 million.
[35:44.160 --> 35:47.960]  So, it's 100, and you got to double that.
[35:47.960 --> 35:48.960]  There's 20%.
[35:48.960 --> 35:50.640]  I was thinking of mine, 10%.
[35:50.640 --> 35:55.640]  So, that'd be 1.5 billion.
[35:55.640 --> 36:03.000]  Okay, so, see, I'm just doing this back when I look, 1.5 billion people under his own statements
[36:03.000 --> 36:08.400]  will get sick or die to save us from something that's killed 300,000 people worldwide if
[36:08.400 --> 36:12.480]  you believe all the fake numbers, because now they just count all flu deaths, car wrecks,
[36:12.480 --> 36:13.480]  gunshot wounds.
[36:13.480 --> 36:14.480]  It's the same.
[36:14.480 --> 36:15.480]  It's the U.N.
[36:15.480 --> 36:21.200]  It's the big enchilada, isn't it?
[36:21.200 --> 36:22.200]  The U.N.
[36:22.200 --> 36:23.640]  tells us what's law.
[36:23.640 --> 36:24.640]  The U.N.
[36:24.640 --> 36:25.640]  tells us what's reality.
[36:25.640 --> 36:26.640]  The U.N.
[36:26.640 --> 36:27.640]  tells us what's about to happen.
[36:27.640 --> 36:31.780]  We're going to go to break, and I'm going to come back into Hollywood's celebration
[36:31.780 --> 36:35.680]  of Twitter censoring the president and how the president plans to strike back with the
[36:35.680 --> 36:40.800]  upcoming executive order that is way overdue, but I still say, hallelujah, even if it's
[36:40.800 --> 36:46.400]  a dollar short, a day late, or a day late, a dollar short.
[36:46.400 --> 36:47.960]  But one last point.
[36:47.960 --> 36:50.880]  We haven't had a sale this big since Christmas.
[36:50.880 --> 36:52.640]  We ran a big sale for a week.
[36:52.640 --> 36:53.640]  Some stuff sold out.
[36:53.640 --> 36:56.400]  We had a new sale, but what we had left, a lot of high-quality products.
[36:56.400 --> 37:00.920]  A few new products got back in, and so we've extended the sale.
[37:00.920 --> 37:05.840]  We've called it the extended memorial day super sale, but when I end the show today,
[37:05.840 --> 37:08.200]  I'm going to go over and look at inventory and figure out what the new sale is.
[37:08.200 --> 37:11.160]  It'll be more limited, but it'll be some of the great items that we have left.
[37:11.160 --> 37:16.400]  But this really is the last day, because we've already sold out of pollen block, bottom
[37:16.400 --> 37:22.720]  mineral fusion bodies, Ultra 12, X3 tri-ionine selling out, the protein bars are selling
[37:22.720 --> 37:25.760]  out, real red pill, red pill, plus they're close to selling out, basal beads are close
[37:25.760 --> 37:26.760]  to selling out.
[37:26.760 --> 37:33.120]  They're still all 40% to 60% off, ultimate krill oil, 50% off, within a super strong
[37:33.120 --> 37:37.360]  vitamin D3, and all the great effects, everybody knows what that does.
[37:37.360 --> 37:43.080]  Full shield X2, 50% off, Emirates Essentials Hand Sanitizer with natural, organic, essential
[37:43.080 --> 37:48.240]  oils and organic, alcohol, that way it didn't dry your hands out, 8-pack power stack is
[37:48.240 --> 37:49.240]  the best deal.
[37:49.240 --> 37:51.960]  We've got 13 different pills, take half of them in the morning, half in the evening,
[37:51.960 --> 37:56.880]  full spectrum dominance, it's the best deal we've got, at cost, 70% off, that's going
[37:56.880 --> 37:59.680]  to have to end soon as we've got that number down towards going to go back to regular price
[37:59.680 --> 38:00.680]  soon.
[38:00.680 --> 38:04.600]  DNA Force Plus is the number one product, if you use any of our products, I'd use X2,
[38:04.600 --> 38:07.160]  or I would use DNA Force Plus.
[38:07.160 --> 38:12.480]  I'd use them both together, but the PQQ, the CoQ10, so many talk show hosts, they ask
[38:12.480 --> 38:14.920]  me, they go, you know, is that stuff real?
[38:14.920 --> 38:19.680]  I mean, do your own research on PQQ and CoQ10, and what's essential?
[38:19.680 --> 38:26.000]  I saw a talk show host this morning, I was watching a funny video titled, Alex Jones
[38:26.000 --> 38:31.640]  is the best, it's a king of the live plug reads, and then they're like going, Jones
[38:31.640 --> 38:35.760]  says it's essential, I don't think it's essential, well, let me explain something.
[38:35.760 --> 38:43.960]  Iodine's essential, vitamin D3 is essential, vitamin B12 is essential, vitamin C is essential,
[38:43.960 --> 38:50.680]  and that means when you don't have it, you die, and you can get it other places, we have
[38:50.680 --> 38:53.600]  high quality sources of it, and it funds our operation.
[38:53.600 --> 38:58.320]  It doesn't mean I haven't put 10 million miles on this body, and I'm perfect, but I couldn't
[38:58.320 --> 39:03.880]  be here today if I wasn't taking DNA Force Plus and things like X2, they absolutely are
[39:03.880 --> 39:07.800]  amazing, and that's why the supplement industry just grows and grows and grows and grows,
[39:07.800 --> 39:15.520]  because it works, and people get a great response, and they see it themselves, go read the reviews.
[39:15.520 --> 39:19.720]  So, Turbo Force, my God, does it work?
[39:19.720 --> 39:22.560]  On this YouTube video I was watching, I read the comments, they're like, no, I take Brain
[39:22.560 --> 39:24.360]  Force, it's incredible.
[39:24.360 --> 39:28.360]  Brain Force has got all these known ingredients that absolutely get you going.
[39:28.360 --> 39:33.480]  Turbo Force is like really clean-hour energy, 10 hours of it, it's amazing.
[39:33.480 --> 39:37.200]  Six of them, see if it's real, I mean, what does that even mean?

[40:27.600 --> 40:31.400]  out, real red pill plus, it's got some stimulant in it, natural caffeine, that's close to selling
[40:31.400 --> 40:35.880]  out, 50% off still, infowarsstore.com, and we're already talking to our suppliers and
[40:35.880 --> 40:39.800]  some of them are saying, we may not take orders in a few months, so I may not ever be able
[40:39.800 --> 40:44.760]  to get products again, things are collapsing so bad, folks, this is total depression, the
[40:44.760 --> 40:53.000]  infrastructure is going down, get the products while you still can.
[40:53.000 --> 40:57.840]  Now it's official, the United Nations came out yesterday and said, the COVID emergency
[40:57.840 --> 41:03.960]  will last five years, and the UK government said, you must all carry cell phones outside
[41:03.960 --> 41:08.280]  or you'll be arrested, because we have to track your social distancing and you're only
[41:08.280 --> 41:13.720]  allowed to have a list of 10 people that you visit, and if you go outside that list of 10,
[41:13.720 --> 41:15.880]  you'll be permanently detained.
[41:15.880 --> 41:20.400]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this is the new world order, where they let the criminals
[41:20.400 --> 41:26.840]  out of jail, the rapists, the child molesters, the murderers, and where you are now non-essential
[41:26.840 --> 41:28.040]  and a prisoner.
[41:28.040 --> 41:31.600]  From the beginning of my research, it was clear the globalists are an authoritarian
[41:31.600 --> 41:37.240]  anti-human group, they have to put this electronic straightjacket on us before they carry out
[41:37.240 --> 41:40.680]  their in-game, which is global depopulation.
[41:40.680 --> 41:47.120]  So you see, submitting to them is death, the only way to stop them is to expose them,
[41:47.120 --> 41:54.160]  to hate their guts, and realize they are humanity's mortal enemy, wake up or die.
[41:54.160 --> 42:01.400]  We are 170 days out from the 2020 election, it is a referendum of national sovereignty
[42:01.400 --> 42:03.200]  against globalism.
[42:03.200 --> 42:07.600]  And Obama, Hillary, and the deep state have been caught attempting to overthrow President
[42:07.600 --> 42:12.080]  Trump's election, and they've been caught in two separate coup attempts against the
[42:12.080 --> 42:13.080]  president.
[42:13.080 --> 42:17.520]  Now, they've been pushing COVID-19 to shut down the economy and create a depression,
[42:17.520 --> 42:20.640]  while China's already been open for business for more than a month.
[42:20.640 --> 42:26.200]  This is an ongoing globalist attempt to punish the American people, wreck our economy, and
[42:26.200 --> 42:29.920]  hope that we won't recognize that it is they, the New World Order, that have orchestrated
[42:29.920 --> 42:32.600]  this and not President Trump.
[42:32.600 --> 42:36.840]  They know their crimes are coming out, they know the chickens are coming home to roost,
[42:36.840 --> 42:42.360]  so now they're panicking and trying to steal the 2020 election with mail-in ballots based
[42:42.360 --> 42:45.360]  on keeping the public safe from COVID-19.
[42:45.360 --> 42:51.920]  The entire COVID-19 system is a giant hope and must be exposed if America has any hope,
[42:51.920 --> 42:54.440]  so get out there and expose this fraud.
[42:54.440 --> 42:58.600]  It took hundreds and hundreds of years of human civilization to build up the world
[42:58.600 --> 43:01.200]  economy to where it is.
[43:01.200 --> 43:06.960]  Every economist is on record saying that as this economy has been shut down for two months,
[43:06.960 --> 43:11.680]  it is going to be a death sentence to the third world and a horrible nightmarish collapse
[43:11.680 --> 43:15.640]  for the first world, and that the general public is going to go into deep, deep debt
[43:15.640 --> 43:16.640]  to the mega banks.
[43:16.640 --> 43:20.280]  They're not going to have medical ID cards, force inoculations.
[43:20.280 --> 43:27.120]  We are now in a giant dystopia, but a lot of people are waking up and there is a major
[43:27.120 --> 43:33.760]  backlash taking place against this tyranny, and we must all rediscover our bill of rights,
[43:33.760 --> 43:38.400]  rediscover our constitution and our backbone, and start saying no to people who take this
[43:38.400 --> 43:43.000]  moral high ground and say shut your business down, shut your life down, it will save lives.
[43:43.000 --> 43:47.280]  No, it's caused millions to already starve to death, tens of millions more.
[43:47.280 --> 43:51.800]  So the cowards who went along with this diversity signaling, you have destroyed your lives and
[43:51.800 --> 43:57.080]  our lives, congratulations.
[43:57.080 --> 44:10.760]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[44:10.760 --> 44:17.400]  Imagine the United States, it's the year 2020, and the United Nations in coordination
[44:17.400 --> 44:21.880]  with major governments tells us that tens of millions are going to die unless we all stay
[44:21.880 --> 44:24.640]  indoors and wear a mask and submit to them.
[44:24.640 --> 44:30.320]  Then it turns out that things are on average 20 times less severe than they said, and they're
[44:30.320 --> 44:34.760]  taking all the regular deaths from other diseases and gunshot wounds and car wrecks and saying
[44:34.760 --> 44:42.320]  it's COVID-19, and then we learned that most of the deaths, more than half, were nursing
[44:42.320 --> 44:46.480]  on patients who died from pneumonia when they put pneumonia patients in there on purpose
[44:46.480 --> 44:51.200]  and countered them all as COVID-19.
[44:51.200 --> 44:58.200]  They said they did it though to keep everybody safe, remember?
[44:58.200 --> 45:03.640]  Remember they did it to keep everybody safe because the hospitals were going to be overwhelmed
[45:03.640 --> 45:07.440]  by the giant amount of COVID-19 patients.
[45:07.440 --> 45:12.120]  So asymptomatic people that were quarantined, meaning they could spread the virus but weren't
[45:12.120 --> 45:17.440]  sick, they'd be sent to the nursing home, which was a total recipe for death.
[45:17.440 --> 45:23.000]  So this is all premeditated.
[45:23.000 --> 45:28.200]  And these governors are auditioning to be a Fauci-level demon, a president, a senator.
[45:28.200 --> 45:35.320]  Because if they'll sit there and cold-bloodily kill old people, they'll do absolutely anything,
[45:35.320 --> 45:36.320]  won't they?
[45:36.320 --> 45:39.880]  Oh, but it's all about in justifies the means.
[45:39.880 --> 45:43.920]  Oh, some vaccines cause damage, but it's for a greater good than you study, it's not even
[45:43.920 --> 45:44.920]  for a greater good.
[45:44.920 --> 45:45.920]  But it's all that idea.
[45:45.920 --> 45:50.560]  Well, we do some bad, but for the greater good.
[45:50.560 --> 45:54.960]  The true essence of authoritarianism, now, Google has moved to China.
[45:54.960 --> 45:57.000]  They're building China's whole infrastructure.
[45:57.000 --> 46:01.480]  And then through subsidiary Chinese companies, the Google executives are becoming fabulously
[46:01.480 --> 46:02.480]  rich.
[46:02.480 --> 46:05.360]  And I've got articles right here where the leftists come out, the heads of Google and
[46:05.360 --> 46:08.840]  others, and they have pledged, just like they did the two days after Hillary lost, they've
[46:08.840 --> 46:13.240]  done it again, that Trump will be defeated and they will deliver the election to Joe
[46:13.240 --> 46:16.120]  Biden, who's a placeholder for whoever they want to put in after that.
[46:16.120 --> 46:20.560]  There's big articles on them, FullWars.com about it, but imagine they're out there bragging,
[46:20.560 --> 46:24.720]  they're going to stop Trump, and the American people, they're going to bully us, suppress
[46:24.720 --> 46:29.320]  us, do all this, and then they go to Congress and say, oh, we're not doing any of that.
[46:29.320 --> 46:36.840]  Hollywood vapid celebrities celebrate POTUS being censored by Twitter, and you read it,
[46:36.840 --> 46:40.680]  it's like, finally, we're going to purge you, none of you people deserve speech.
[46:40.680 --> 46:42.520]  Wow, what a bunch of nice liberals.
[46:42.520 --> 46:49.160]  Yeah, scroll down, show some of the quotes, foaming at the mouth, massive, Twitter says
[46:49.160 --> 46:54.160]  it will put a warning label on the lies and disinformation tweeted by Trump, since Trump
[46:54.160 --> 46:59.760]  is incapable of tweeting without lying, adios, amigo, and don't let the door hit you on the
[46:59.760 --> 47:06.000]  way out.
[47:06.000 --> 47:12.320]  So that's Rob Reiner that celebrated yours truly being taken off Facebook and Twitter.
[47:12.320 --> 47:15.040]  Oh, there's no fact checking Rob Reiner here, let's go to the next person.
[47:15.040 --> 47:20.840]  Of course, Trump was totally right about tens of millions of mail-in ballots in California
[47:20.840 --> 47:27.200]  being sent out to everybody for fraud.
[47:27.200 --> 47:31.680]  So that's just how these people operate, it's what they do.
[47:31.680 --> 47:36.120]  Your incompetence led to the unnecessary deaths of tens of thousands of innocent Americans
[47:36.120 --> 47:42.920]  and destroyed the economy, the Barack Obama built, you're a racist birther, a puppet of
[47:42.920 --> 47:49.960]  Vladimir Putin, and a con man, you're destroying our future, fact check that.
[47:49.960 --> 47:55.720]  You malignant narcissist, that's Brandy Whitford, and it goes on and on.
[47:55.720 --> 47:59.400]  Now, imagine, did anybody fact check the Russiagate being a fraud?
[47:59.400 --> 48:00.400]  No.
[48:00.400 --> 48:01.400]  Do they fact check saying he's a racist?
[48:01.400 --> 48:04.120]  No, because they're all allowed to say what they want.
[48:04.120 --> 48:10.800]  But Jack Dorsey, he stands by what he did, and it just goes on from there.
[48:10.800 --> 48:14.920]  Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey stands by decision to fact check Trump.
[48:14.920 --> 48:21.680]  Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has defended his platform's decision to fact check US President Trump
[48:21.680 --> 48:27.000]  for the first time ever over his comments on the upcoming election.
[48:27.000 --> 48:37.280]  Black millionaires are plotting sweeping secret plans to boost Joe Biden Vox's news celebrates.
[48:37.280 --> 48:41.520]  Senator to Google, cow telling the communist, China is unacceptable in full wars.com.
[48:41.520 --> 48:47.240]  Senator Josh Hawley, Republican Missouri, Zuckerberg knocks Twitter for fact checking
[48:47.240 --> 48:51.280]  Trump says private companies shouldn't be the arbiter of truth, but he's actually doing
[48:51.280 --> 48:53.040]  all of that even worse than they are.
[48:53.040 --> 48:56.880]  But then he acts like, oh, I'm with you, Trump, I agree with free speech with, please don't
[48:56.880 --> 48:57.880]  regulate me.
[48:57.880 --> 49:00.920]  Let's, let's, let's play a clip.
[49:00.920 --> 49:06.440]  This is again for mainly TV viewers, but this is live time YouTube blocking criticism of
[49:06.440 --> 49:09.400]  the Communist Party, China in the rest of the world.
[49:09.400 --> 49:12.400]  YouTube's already banned in China, but they want to get on good terms with them.
[49:12.400 --> 49:16.480]  So now whatever the Communist Party tells them to ban the bots in live time, delete it.
[49:16.480 --> 49:17.480]  So here it is.
[49:17.480 --> 49:18.480]  See that?
[49:18.480 --> 49:25.720]  And you type in the terms you're not supposed to say, but the Communist Party being bandits
[49:25.720 --> 49:34.560]  but the Communist Party being a 50 cent party and in live time, you hit refresh and it goes
[49:34.560 --> 49:37.000]  bye, bye.
[49:37.000 --> 49:40.560]  And YouTube admits that they are doing that.
[49:40.560 --> 49:47.360]  So they're working with a foreign power, ladies and gentlemen, they're working with
[49:47.360 --> 49:56.040]  a foreign power and submitting to this gets you tyranny.
[49:56.040 --> 50:00.520]  Even the verge is like, wow, YouTube's deleting comments critical of the Communist Party,
[50:00.520 --> 50:01.520]  China.
[50:01.520 --> 50:02.520]  Yeah.
[50:02.520 --> 50:10.120]  And they're deleting the Hong Kong protesters and they're now telling you that Trump is
[50:10.120 --> 50:11.480]  where the virus came from.
[50:11.480 --> 50:14.920]  Member Cuomo said the European virus doesn't make any sense.
[50:14.920 --> 50:15.920]  Why?
[50:15.920 --> 50:20.200]  It's all about disinfo, it's all about lying and conditioning you to accept that they can
[50:20.200 --> 50:24.800]  lie as much as they want.
[50:24.800 --> 50:29.960]  But the good news is Trump is preparing an executive order.
[50:29.960 --> 50:36.160]  We have several drafts of them that are posted up on infowars.com and it ramps up and orders
[50:36.160 --> 50:41.320]  the federal government and federal prosecutors to go after examples of bias and election
[50:41.320 --> 50:48.840]  meddling and suppression of speech.
[50:48.840 --> 50:57.840]  It's so important and what I'm going to do is I'm going to start the next hour and I'm
[50:57.840 --> 51:01.800]  going to read some of it and then I'm going to go to your calls.
[51:01.800 --> 51:10.800]  The riots going on in Minnesota, California, Falcon 9 canceled from the tornadoes and stuff.
[51:10.800 --> 51:16.000]  Cuomo, Texas was wild last night, I've never seen such thunderstorms.
[51:16.000 --> 51:22.080]  The censorship, Trump finally saying he's going to take action.
[51:22.080 --> 51:26.680]  How they admit now that they just lied about every level of COVID-19 on purpose, when did
[51:26.680 --> 51:27.680]  they get in trouble?
[51:27.680 --> 51:34.080]  All the old people being murdered, more than half the hundred thousand dead are in nursing
[51:34.080 --> 51:35.080]  homes.
[51:35.080 --> 51:36.080]  I mean, this is insane.
[51:36.080 --> 51:40.600]  The doctor said you don't bring people with an aggressive pneumonia in a nursing home.
[51:40.600 --> 51:44.680]  They tell you, if you have old folks you're going to visit, if you've got a cold or pneumonia
[51:44.680 --> 51:45.680]  don't go.
[51:45.680 --> 51:47.280]  I mean, that's not rocket science.
[51:47.280 --> 51:48.920]  Oh, I've got pneumonia.
[51:48.920 --> 51:54.280]  Let me visit my 85-year-old grandmother in the nursing home because you've got nice nursing
[51:54.280 --> 51:55.800]  homes and you've got bad nursing homes.
[51:55.800 --> 52:00.520]  You've got the places where people care about patients and staff cares and your family goes
[52:00.520 --> 52:05.280]  and visits and hey, my mom's going out of town, she usually visits grandma twice a week,
[52:05.280 --> 52:06.280]  my grandma's dead now.
[52:06.280 --> 52:09.080]  You know, hey, mom's going out of town, I visit grandma every couple of weeks.
[52:09.080 --> 52:11.200]  She should do it more.
[52:11.200 --> 52:12.600]  But her nursing home was right down the street here.
[52:12.600 --> 52:16.080]  We used to have Weldon, Henson, the folks go play music for them, local country bands
[52:16.080 --> 52:17.080]  and stuff.
[52:17.080 --> 52:18.080]  She loved it.
[52:18.080 --> 52:19.080]  Put them on parties for them.
[52:19.080 --> 52:21.760]  But every two weeks or so I visited, sometimes more often.
[52:21.760 --> 52:27.080]  We'd make her get in the wheelchair, come to the house, but she died at 92, but my mom
[52:27.080 --> 52:28.720]  visited twice a week, took three times a week.
[52:28.720 --> 52:32.000]  So when she's out of town, I go visit her twice a week.
[52:32.000 --> 52:38.400]  But the point is, is that a nursing home's fine if you got eyes on it.
[52:38.400 --> 52:41.880]  And under COVID, they locked them all down and said, oh, family can't come.
[52:41.880 --> 52:43.560]  Only if you have COVID can you come.
[52:43.560 --> 52:44.920]  Oh, family can't come.
[52:44.920 --> 52:45.920]  You might bring COVID.
[52:45.920 --> 52:47.840]  But if you have COVID, you can come in.
[52:47.840 --> 52:50.600]  That's a war on logic, folks.
[52:50.600 --> 52:57.280]  But it's because there was $50,000 plus dollars per person that they whacked.
[52:57.280 --> 52:58.280]  And it drove up the numbers.
[52:58.280 --> 53:03.840]  And it was all just about there are too many damn old people and Cuomo and people like
[53:03.840 --> 53:04.840]  Psycho Newsome.
[53:04.840 --> 53:08.080]  They just think, communist socialists always kill old people.
[53:08.080 --> 53:15.040]  They're like, I'll kill some old people, I don't understand that.
[53:15.040 --> 53:17.160]  But you can break their back.
[53:17.160 --> 53:18.360]  You can expose them.
[53:18.360 --> 53:19.680]  You can override their censorship.
[53:19.680 --> 53:22.040]  They're launching their whole plan.
[53:22.040 --> 53:26.480]  But if you simply take the live feeds and then fullwars.com forward slash show or band
[53:26.480 --> 53:30.640]  dot video and the live feeds on the left hand side of the auction show, the other shows,
[53:30.640 --> 53:35.000]  if you simply in your email, in your text message, yet the grocery store go, hey, COVID
[53:35.000 --> 53:38.160]  19's a hoax, they're killing old people in nursing homes.
[53:38.160 --> 53:42.640]  They tell you don't go there because it's the truth, infowars.com forward slash show.
[53:42.640 --> 53:49.200]  And that absolutely is what keeps the globalist awake at night is you realizing how powerful
[53:49.200 --> 53:54.160]  you are and how incredible you are and taking action, especially if there's local AM and
[53:54.160 --> 53:55.160]  FM stations.
[53:55.160 --> 53:58.160]  Man, you're listening to us on local AM or FM, you can pull up the red light and say,
[53:58.160 --> 54:04.200]  hey, hey, brother, big COVID-19 news you need to know is on the station.
[54:04.200 --> 54:10.920]  FM AM, tell them Alex Jones is on local TV and there's another local talk show host
[54:10.920 --> 54:11.920]  telling the truth.
[54:11.920 --> 54:12.920]  Tell folks about them.
[54:12.920 --> 54:13.920]  Get up in front of your church.
[54:13.920 --> 54:15.280]  Go do your own talk show.
[54:15.280 --> 54:16.520]  Just do it.
[54:16.520 --> 54:18.640]  My God.
[54:18.640 --> 54:22.400]  It's not heroic to stand up for old people getting killed.
[54:22.400 --> 54:27.480]  Let me tell you what a nightmare to be left in some nursing home by your children.
[54:27.480 --> 54:30.400]  And then you've got, you know, they bring a COVID patient in because they're going to
[54:30.400 --> 54:35.800]  be sick and then make a tube down your throat as soon as you get a fever and kill your ass.
[54:35.800 --> 54:37.480]  And the average nurse just follows orders.
[54:37.480 --> 54:44.200]  They're the ones speaking out saying this is crazy.
[54:44.200 --> 54:46.440]  This is the end, my friends.
[54:46.440 --> 54:52.360]  My only friends, the end of our elaborate plans, the end of everything that stands,
[54:52.360 --> 54:56.960]  the end of safety, the delusion.
[54:56.960 --> 55:03.280]  It's all over, ladies and gentlemen, because it was only the mirage of safety, movies and
[55:03.280 --> 55:08.760]  partying and living like children, never growing up, never caring about other people.
[55:08.760 --> 55:13.840]  This delivered us into the hands of tyranny, just like the history book show us, just like
[55:13.840 --> 55:15.360]  the Bible states.
[55:15.360 --> 55:19.600]  Every time Israel became corrupt and evil and turned away from God, they were brought
[55:19.600 --> 55:25.360]  into captivity because their people sold out to special interests and were infiltrated
[55:25.360 --> 55:28.360]  by spies, and then they were enslaved.
[55:28.360 --> 55:34.040]  We are repeating that again today, compliance and going along with this system leads to
[55:34.040 --> 55:36.520]  absolute bondage.
[55:36.520 --> 55:40.600]  Info Wars has decided to fight for freedom, and Info Wars has had great victory thanks
[55:40.600 --> 55:44.720]  to your support and your prayers.
[55:44.720 --> 55:49.720]  The panic that has been orchestrated by the global corporatist media and the chai comms
[55:49.720 --> 55:53.480]  is going to now trigger a worldwide depression.
[55:53.480 --> 55:57.160]  In fact, we're already into the worldwide depression and the death sentence for the
[55:57.160 --> 55:58.160]  third world.
[55:58.160 --> 56:03.600]  But it's critical to understand that the longer the shutdown persists, the worse it's
[56:03.600 --> 56:04.600]  going to be.
[56:04.600 --> 56:09.960]  A month of shutdown will destroy decades of wealth that's been built up in a complex
[56:09.960 --> 56:10.960]  economy.
[56:10.960 --> 56:15.000]  That's why we've always said it's important to be a prepper and to be somewhat self-sufficient
[56:15.000 --> 56:19.720]  because the globalists want to make us all dependent so that we're under their control.
[56:19.720 --> 56:22.120]  They've admitted all of this.
[56:22.120 --> 56:28.200]  So remember, how does Info Wars continue years and decades in many cases to be able to predict
[56:28.200 --> 56:30.160]  things before they happen?
[56:30.160 --> 56:35.000]  Because we're following the globalist blueprint and their battle plan, and yes it's dystopic
[56:35.000 --> 56:36.440]  and yes it's scary.
[56:36.440 --> 56:40.600]  But denying it and letting them carry it out is a thousand times more scary.
[56:40.600 --> 57:05.600]  It's time to stop the denial and realize what's really happening.
[57:05.600 --> 57:11.160]  He's 61 days out from the election and Joe Biden wants you to know that he will beat
[57:11.160 --> 57:12.160]  Joe Biden.
[57:12.160 --> 57:18.560]  I'm prepared to say that I have a record of over 40 years and that I'm going to beat
[57:18.560 --> 57:20.000]  Joe Biden.
[57:20.000 --> 57:22.520]  Biden has set himself up for disaster.
[57:22.520 --> 57:26.560]  He is clearly an old school racist from a bygone era.
[57:26.560 --> 57:30.280]  His latest statements have created a never-ending storm of criticism.
[57:30.280 --> 57:35.320]  Do you have a problem figuring out whether you're for Mayor Trump and you ain't black?
[57:35.320 --> 57:40.600]  That is the most arrogant, condescending comment I've heard in a very long time.
[57:40.600 --> 57:43.760]  1.3 million African Americans voted for Trump.
[57:43.760 --> 57:48.360]  He's saying that 1.3 million African Americans, that you're not black?
[57:48.360 --> 57:54.200]  It was precisely the kind of thing that a lot of Democrats are worried about Biden doing
[57:54.200 --> 57:56.400]  again and again on the campaign trail.
[57:56.400 --> 58:01.400]  I've been fighting against this notion that you're not black enough unless you think a
[58:01.400 --> 58:02.400]  certain way.
[58:02.400 --> 58:03.400]  You vote a certain way.
[58:03.400 --> 58:04.640]  You speak a certain way.
[58:04.640 --> 58:06.200]  You do certain things.
[58:06.200 --> 58:09.400]  My whole life, it is black voices for Trump and their statement.
[58:09.400 --> 58:12.480]  I'm just going to read the first couple of sentences.
[58:12.480 --> 58:17.120]  White liberal elitists have continuously dictated which black Americans are allowed to come
[58:17.120 --> 58:19.800]  to the table and have a voice.
[58:19.800 --> 58:24.320]  It is clear now, more than ever, following these racist and dehumanizing remarks that
[58:24.320 --> 58:31.000]  Joe Biden believes black men and women are incapable of being independent or free-thinking.
[58:31.000 --> 58:35.800]  He truly believes that a 77-year-old white man should dictate how black people should
[58:35.800 --> 58:37.200]  behave.
[58:37.200 --> 58:43.080]  Democrats are scrambling to normalize the damage as their schizophrenic ideology clashes within
[58:43.080 --> 58:44.240]  their own ranks.
[58:44.240 --> 58:49.680]  I've never, ever, ever taken the African American community for granted.
[58:49.680 --> 58:52.680]  I shouldn't have been such a wise guy.
[58:52.680 --> 58:57.680]  Nothing has changed in America for black America.
[58:57.680 --> 59:04.160]  In order for us to vote for Biden, we can't be taken for granted like we always are because
[59:04.160 --> 59:09.560]  we're supposed to be Democrats or because people are afraid of Trump.
[59:09.560 --> 59:11.600]  It's whoever's going to take care of our community.
[59:11.600 --> 59:13.640]  Our vote is not for free.
[59:13.640 --> 59:17.240]  Whoever wants to make a deal, it's business at this point.
[59:17.240 --> 59:19.200]  We can't trust politicians.
[59:19.200 --> 59:24.360]  The level of hubris it takes for a white man, an old white man or any white person to even
[59:24.360 --> 59:31.200]  ingest, say that he can determine who is black and who isn't, is clearly outlandish.
[59:31.200 --> 59:36.320]  But even ingest, these are the kind of comments that could be problematic, but he clearly knows
[59:36.320 --> 59:37.320]  his audience.
[59:37.320 --> 59:40.760]  I have to have the privilege of working directly with the vice president.
[59:40.760 --> 59:44.480]  Actually, he swore me in as U.S. ambassador to South Africa.
[59:44.480 --> 59:49.120]  I know that he's a conscious, thoughtful person on these issues.
[59:49.120 --> 59:53.520]  Regardless, everyone knows that Joe Biden doesn't stand a chance.
[59:53.520 --> 59:59.000]  We're all just patiently awaiting what will be the most embarrassing presidential debate
[59:59.000 --> 1:00:00.480]  in U.S. history.
[1:00:00.480 --> 1:00:07.160]  No man has a right to raise a hand to a woman in anger, and so we have to just change the
[1:00:07.160 --> 1:00:12.480]  culture, period, and keep punching at it and punching at it and punching at it.
[1:00:12.480 --> 1:00:18.600]  Ukrainian foreign minister said on Thursday that the United States ambassador did not link
[1:00:18.600 --> 1:00:25.680]  financial military assistance to a request for Ukraine to open up an investigation into
[1:00:25.680 --> 1:00:31.200]  form of vice president and current Democratic president, I can you believe?
[1:00:31.200 --> 1:00:37.000]  Like we need help to beat sleepy Joe Biden, I don't think so.
[1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:44.600]  President Trump has helped create a $75 billion investment into the poorest communities, and
[1:00:44.600 --> 1:00:52.160]  now Lindsey Graham and the president are working to bring broadband into those poorest areas.
[1:00:52.160 --> 1:00:57.920]  The ability to connect people who today are unconnected for learning, for medicine, and
[1:00:57.920 --> 1:01:00.080]  for jobs of the future.
[1:01:00.080 --> 1:01:07.440]  What has, but Joe Biden done in the last 20 years, and the answer is crickets.
[1:01:07.440 --> 1:01:14.760]  He's a placeholder for Hillary and Obama, and that's now admitted.
[1:01:14.760 --> 1:01:19.000]  Everybody keeps laughing at Joe Biden, oh, you're going to be laughing when they have
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:25.040]  that DNC event, and Joe Biden announces he's got a brain tumor or something, and they're
[1:01:25.040 --> 1:01:28.440]  going to hand the baton right there, and they're going to have their new candidate who's not
[1:01:28.440 --> 1:01:30.440]  been criticized, anything ready to attack.
[1:01:30.440 --> 1:01:35.320]  Oh, by the way, the candidate is known as Hillary Clinton, and the VP is Barack Obama.
[1:01:35.320 --> 1:01:36.320]  That's the current plan.
[1:01:36.320 --> 1:01:42.840]  I told you that a while back, now it's admitted, and they've almost got Michelle Obama, Michael,
[1:01:42.840 --> 1:01:52.080]  Longgong Silver ready to do it, we'll be right back.
[1:01:52.080 --> 1:01:58.640]  Infowars has become a symbol, an emblem of not just American freedom, but worldwide Maverick
[1:01:58.640 --> 1:01:59.640]  spirit.
[1:01:59.640 --> 1:02:04.680]  It's not just myself or the host at Infowars, or the researchers, or the journalists, it's
[1:02:04.680 --> 1:02:09.560]  you, the listeners, the activists, the people on the front lines in the arena, and it's
[1:02:09.560 --> 1:02:15.280]  the amazing guests and individuals that we interview that make Infowars so special because
[1:02:15.280 --> 1:02:18.000]  we're not putting a filter in front of three minds.
[1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:23.080]  We're having an open discussion about the real state of the world, not the establishment
[1:02:23.080 --> 1:02:26.800]  of talking points that are put out by the Council on Foreign Relations, the Bilderberg
[1:02:26.800 --> 1:02:29.640]  Group, the Davos Group, and other clubs.
[1:02:29.640 --> 1:02:35.880]  We're pushing for a pro-human future where we build a planet and beyond based on humans,
[1:02:35.880 --> 1:02:36.880]  poor humans, bi-humans.
[1:02:36.880 --> 1:02:42.200]  Not a world where the establishment, hate themselves, project their hate onto us and
[1:02:42.200 --> 1:02:45.200]  decide we're going to have a post-human world.
[1:02:45.200 --> 1:02:49.400]  Really excited to know that Infowars has your support, and I want to thank you all for being
[1:02:49.400 --> 1:02:51.080]  pro-human and pro-God.
[1:02:51.080 --> 1:03:11.800]  I have the keys of destiny, I have the keys of future, I have the keys to everlasting
[1:03:11.800 --> 1:03:12.800]  life.
[1:03:12.800 --> 1:03:40.160]  I have the keys because they were given to me by Jesus Christ.
[1:03:40.160 --> 1:03:45.920]  I didn't win those keys.
[1:03:45.920 --> 1:03:49.800]  You didn't win those keys.
[1:03:49.800 --> 1:03:55.920]  God humbling himself and the human formed it, and it's real, and you can feel the time
[1:03:55.920 --> 1:04:01.920]  space continue on electricity when you make that spiritual choice to reach out to God.
[1:04:01.920 --> 1:04:08.120]  God will reach out, and then that moment happens.
[1:04:08.120 --> 1:04:17.560]  That moment, all Satan's fear, when what is hidden, is revealed.
[1:04:17.560 --> 1:04:23.880]  All right.
[1:04:23.880 --> 1:04:27.120]  This is not about taking credit.
[1:04:27.120 --> 1:04:35.640]  It's about taking review, taking stock.
[1:04:35.640 --> 1:04:41.720]  I knew that everybody was afraid to advise the president, because if you did, all hell
[1:04:41.720 --> 1:04:44.640]  would break loose and it would come after you and your family.
[1:04:44.640 --> 1:04:48.000]  But I thought, hey, why go half hog, let's go full hog.
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:51.800]  So I financed three major law firms separately from each other.
[1:04:51.800 --> 1:05:00.120]  Three of the biggest in D.C. paid them a lot of money.
[1:05:00.120 --> 1:05:05.400]  To not just write up drafts of how the president could sign executive orders, and another plan
[1:05:05.400 --> 1:05:06.400]  was a commission.
[1:05:06.400 --> 1:05:11.520]  That's what one of the law firms came up with, and it wasn't just the money to write
[1:05:11.520 --> 1:05:21.800]  these plans up, including with advice from some of the top people in telecommunications.
[1:05:21.800 --> 1:05:30.760]  Folks, very close, I mean, like in the chair, you know, I'm not bragging, it's so easy
[1:05:30.760 --> 1:05:33.320]  to take action when you do it.
[1:05:33.320 --> 1:05:39.640]  And we got all this into El Presidente's hands two and a half years ago, and that's
[1:05:39.640 --> 1:05:41.480]  when you saw the headlines.
[1:05:41.480 --> 1:05:46.640]  John Kelly's main mission is keeping Alex Jones' material out of the president's hand.
[1:05:46.640 --> 1:05:52.920]  See, I wasn't trying to lobby him to get some subsidy for nuclear submarines I was building,
[1:05:52.920 --> 1:05:56.120]  or I wasn't trying to get subsidies for a golf course, or I wasn't trying to get subsidies
[1:05:56.120 --> 1:05:57.120]  for something.
[1:05:57.120 --> 1:06:01.600]  I didn't want something from the president for me.
[1:06:01.600 --> 1:06:13.600]  I wanted him to take action for everybody, and I knew that anybody, including Trump's
[1:06:13.600 --> 1:06:22.960]  sons that advised him properly, like Don Jr., who's an employer, would be attacked.
[1:06:22.960 --> 1:06:30.480]  Now I only tell that story because it's true and it's illustrative of how real Trump is.
[1:06:30.480 --> 1:06:37.800]  100% real, folks.
[1:06:37.800 --> 1:06:42.520]  Also 100% pigheaded.
[1:06:42.520 --> 1:06:46.880]  But he believes he's president, which he is, and he believes he's doing the best interest,
[1:06:46.880 --> 1:06:49.880]  and he really is trying to be the president and not let a bunch of people tell him what
[1:06:49.880 --> 1:06:50.880]  to do.
[1:06:50.880 --> 1:06:53.440]  For whatever reason, he tends to listen to us.
[1:06:53.440 --> 1:06:59.200]  He, Tucker Carlson, like, is the most influential person in America, other than Trump.
[1:06:59.200 --> 1:07:05.080]  I mean, Trump, like, literally listens to everything Tucker Carlson says, which is good.
[1:07:05.080 --> 1:07:10.960]  So that just shows you who Trump really is, because, I mean, I can tell you something.
[1:07:10.960 --> 1:07:14.440]  I've gotten messages to Trump, or I've talked to Trump, and I've watched him a day later
[1:07:14.440 --> 1:07:18.560]  with notes he's got word for word on national TV, and you know the globalists are listening
[1:07:18.560 --> 1:07:21.880]  to my phone lines, listening to those conversations, and then they see him the next day, and they
[1:07:21.880 --> 1:07:24.520]  are crapping bricks, man.
[1:07:24.520 --> 1:07:26.240]  So again, is Trump real?
[1:07:26.240 --> 1:07:41.720]  You're damn right he's real, 100% folks, 100% real.
[1:07:41.720 --> 1:07:47.360]  And Trump is an idiot savant, and I don't mean he's an idiot, he's a savant in that
[1:07:47.360 --> 1:07:51.960]  he does whatever he thinks gut level is the best move.
[1:07:51.960 --> 1:07:55.000]  And most of the time that's right when he's given the right information, like Roger Stone
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:07:59.680]  always says, if Trump's given the right information, the right briefing, and he already knows a
[1:07:59.680 --> 1:08:03.400]  lot of it, he clicks with it, he makes the right decision every time.
[1:08:03.400 --> 1:08:10.880]  But if they can distract him, and put him in a bubble, and confuse him, they can slip
[1:08:10.880 --> 1:08:13.560]  stuff past.
[1:08:13.560 --> 1:08:19.000]  But now the 158 days out, and he's got the new national director of intelligence, and
[1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:23.680]  he's gotten all his people in place, the system, he's pulling the trips out of Afghanistan,
[1:08:23.680 --> 1:08:27.640]  he's won in the trade war with China, he's reboosting the economy, and of course he's
[1:08:27.640 --> 1:08:33.240]  doing it fiat, that's the only weapons he's got.
[1:08:33.240 --> 1:08:42.840]  He's winning, but I can tell you this, and this is a discussion we should all be having.
[1:08:42.840 --> 1:08:47.240]  Just like back in December, it was clear that they weren't going to pass the impeachment,
[1:08:47.240 --> 1:08:53.640]  they didn't have the votes, and then into January I said, listen, I put it up on screen
[1:08:53.640 --> 1:08:59.360]  an image of an astronaut on earth with bio-weapons in the air, and I said, I believe, we found
[1:08:59.360 --> 1:09:03.520]  the clips, that they're going to release a bio-weapon or something, and I said, look,
[1:09:03.520 --> 1:09:09.480]  Bill Gates is doing drills of this, I know their next move, my God, it's not that hard.
[1:09:09.480 --> 1:09:21.120]  And just to sure, as the colors for the University of Texas at Austin are burnt orange, and
[1:09:21.120 --> 1:09:25.280]  just as sure as your grandma loves you, and just as sure as the sun came up this morning,
[1:09:25.280 --> 1:09:30.120]  they get exactly what we thought, so we better start asking all the callers, and myself and
[1:09:30.120 --> 1:09:37.600]  all the guests, what comes next, because the depression's here, and it's going to be bad,
[1:09:37.600 --> 1:09:42.120]  but Trump's not getting the full blame, yeah, the internal polls, they brought him down
[1:09:42.120 --> 1:09:48.680]  from like a 60 to a 55, so he sees loss, it's hurting.
[1:09:48.680 --> 1:09:53.680]  But what are they going to pull next, because if you think with 158 days left, when he starts
[1:09:53.680 --> 1:09:57.640]  going after big tech censorship, and he starts going after the deep state, and he starts releasing
[1:09:57.640 --> 1:10:08.120]  all this, what are they going to do next, I'll tell you what they're going to do next.
[1:10:08.120 --> 1:10:14.120]  They're going to try to kill the president, and they're going to try to start race riots,
[1:10:14.120 --> 1:10:17.400]  which you now see going on, and of course they used a real event to do it, they've always
[1:10:17.400 --> 1:10:22.560]  got that ready, there's 350 million people in this country.
[1:10:22.560 --> 1:10:27.120]  You want a Chinese guy killing a white lady, you want a black guy killing a white dude,
[1:10:27.120 --> 1:10:32.400]  you want a white guy killing a black dude, anything you want's on video now every day,
[1:10:32.400 --> 1:10:36.040]  and you can decide when to pick it up, and when to promote it, when to push it, and when
[1:10:36.040 --> 1:10:43.760]  to get the burden down buildings you want.
[1:10:43.760 --> 1:10:47.760]  So race war, they're going to have women come out and say Trump raped them, they're going
[1:10:47.760 --> 1:10:51.600]  to try to kill the president, and they're going to have, I think China's going to move on Hong
[1:10:51.600 --> 1:10:52.600]  Kong.
[1:10:52.600 --> 1:10:56.080]  In fact, they already are moving on it, but I mean, they're saying they may invade.
[1:10:56.080 --> 1:11:00.000]  So you got that going on, you got the big banks may try something again to drive down
[1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:05.920]  the stock market, I mean this is a, all I'm trying to say is everybody better be watching
[1:11:05.920 --> 1:11:15.240]  their 6, their 12, their 9, their 3, their 4, their 7, you better be watching every point
[1:11:15.240 --> 1:11:23.760]  of the compass because every day that goes by now is like 50 years, I mean this is zeitgeist
[1:11:23.760 --> 1:11:29.520]  quickening singularity moment.
[1:11:29.520 --> 1:11:31.640]  So I'm going to open the phones up, and I'm going to get some of the transcript of his
[1:11:31.640 --> 1:11:37.320]  executive order, the draft is on infowars.com and who'swars.com right now, but I do see
[1:11:37.320 --> 1:11:43.240]  little, little schmiblets of what we sent out, and again that's a rule, it is satisfaction.
[1:11:43.240 --> 1:11:47.040]  Not for my ego that I'm a big shot and I'm having a big effect, but you know what, I've
[1:11:47.040 --> 1:11:51.400]  gone through some hell, I've took a couple of knots on my head, and then when I sit back
[1:11:51.400 --> 1:12:00.160]  and I see that had an effect, you know what, now those scars become trophies, signets,
[1:12:00.160 --> 1:12:06.440]  sigils of victory, you know I got a lot of scars on me, and back at the time that happened
[1:12:06.440 --> 1:12:14.560]  I didn't like them, man I look at the stab wound I had, I look at other stuff, my scars,
[1:12:14.560 --> 1:12:19.240]  and now every one of them is valuable, because that teaches me an experience that takes me
[1:12:19.240 --> 1:12:26.840]  back to that moment, when you taste that blood in your mouth, and those switches flip, and
[1:12:26.840 --> 1:12:31.080]  everything you are is on the line, and let me tell you, staring into that abyss, you're
[1:12:31.080 --> 1:12:36.480]  proud of what you are, because you're fire breathing, you're alive, you got red blood,
[1:12:36.480 --> 1:12:42.000]  and you're coming for the Satanist, you're coming with God's vengeance, vengeance is
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:52.320]  the Lord's, but God has his swords, his weapons, his devices, his tools.
[1:12:52.320 --> 1:12:57.200]  You're living in insanely dangerous times, and I told folks going back three months ago,
[1:12:57.200 --> 1:13:00.840]  I'm not buying storeable food, because I'm worried about the COVID-19 virus, I'm worried
[1:13:00.840 --> 1:13:05.080]  about the food shortages, and the economic collapse, and now it's admitted that a chain
[1:13:05.080 --> 1:13:09.160]  reaction has begun that's already caused food shortages, and the collapse of farms and
[1:13:09.160 --> 1:13:12.880]  ranches across the United States, and it's even worse in the third world, so I hope
[1:13:12.880 --> 1:13:17.080]  Trump, with his initiatives, can clean this up and fix it, but with the election fraud,
[1:13:17.080 --> 1:13:21.160]  and the COVID-19, all the wars, and the third world collapsing, and everything else is going
[1:13:21.160 --> 1:13:26.120]  on, now is the time to get storeable foods, because they'll last for 25 years, they're
[1:13:26.120 --> 1:13:30.840]  an easily totable bag, it's high quality food, and it's good to have that box checked off
[1:13:30.840 --> 1:13:35.440]  to be ready, and it funds the InfoWars, so we have storeable food available again, InfoWarsTour.com
[1:13:35.440 --> 1:13:40.520]  or call toll-free, AAA-253-3139, but whatever you do, get prepared and get ready, because
[1:13:40.520 --> 1:13:44.240]  the globalists want you dependent on them, they do not want you to be self-sufficient,
[1:13:44.240 --> 1:13:50.840]  get your storeable food at InfoWarsTour.com right now while you still can.
[1:13:50.840 --> 1:13:55.040]  Memorial Day is here, it's one of the biggest sales of the year, and we were already running
[1:13:55.040 --> 1:13:59.040]  a huge sale, but we're having to end that one because a bunch of items are selling out,
[1:13:59.040 --> 1:14:03.560]  but all the items we have left at stock are still on record sale, and then five items
[1:14:03.560 --> 1:14:07.840]  that weren't on sale, we got back at stock, they're also massively discounted as well

[1:14:46.120 --> 1:14:53.360]  thank you all for your support, we are all in this together.
[1:14:53.360 --> 1:15:13.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:15:13.560 --> 1:15:17.800]  I'm going to give the number out on this live Thursday global transmission, on any subject
[1:15:17.800 --> 1:15:21.960]  you want to cover, first time callers, long term callers, you agree, you disagree, belly
[1:15:21.960 --> 1:15:35.800]  up to the bar and let's go, 877-789-2539, 877-789 Alex, four of your calling outside the U.S.
[1:15:35.800 --> 1:15:46.840]  You can't call 1-800 sometimes, country code 512-646-1776, okay, these are epic times and
[1:15:46.840 --> 1:15:52.400]  I'm charged up because everything they do is about showing you horrible, incredibly
[1:15:52.400 --> 1:16:01.960]  evil things, simulated and real, and getting you to where you just don't care anymore and
[1:16:01.960 --> 1:16:08.720]  you're desensitized, so that's why as horrible as George Floyd being slowly murdered by that
[1:16:08.720 --> 1:16:14.680]  police officer is, the fact that people saw that humanity and saw someone begging for
[1:16:14.680 --> 1:16:23.200]  their life and got pissed is a good thing, but the target shouldn't be empty stores
[1:16:23.200 --> 1:16:31.440]  and looting, you become what you claim you're fighting, the target should be the globalist
[1:16:31.440 --> 1:16:38.560]  and the training and the idiocy and the things that allow this type of stuff to take place
[1:16:38.560 --> 1:16:46.120]  and the media playing on racial division to try to sabotage civilization and the footage
[1:16:46.120 --> 1:16:52.440]  of L.A. that will play in a moment of the burning auto center, huge auto zone, it's
[1:16:52.440 --> 1:16:57.000]  like the size of a Walmart and you've got the National Guard with their guns up on top
[1:16:57.000 --> 1:17:02.480]  of the police station, what is that show, you don't care how many robots you got, I don't
[1:17:02.480 --> 1:17:06.040]  care how many troops you got, people want to start burning stuff down, they don't need
[1:17:06.040 --> 1:17:11.920]  guns or anything, now again most of the people out there just gangbanger idiots that want
[1:17:11.920 --> 1:17:15.440]  to rob something, absolutely, is it wrong they're going after the average cop, absolutely,
[1:17:15.440 --> 1:17:20.760]  is it wrong they're beating up old white ladies, whatever, it's not good, the point
[1:17:20.760 --> 1:17:25.840]  is though that the natural instinct, when you see somebody begging for their life and
[1:17:25.840 --> 1:17:31.320]  they're killed for no reason is to go out as a military and say well what is it I see,
[1:17:31.320 --> 1:17:38.080]  well it's uniforms or these are white people, that's at least the first step to understanding
[1:17:38.080 --> 1:17:43.320]  the new world order, I'm not endorsing anybody, I think it's terrible, but at least the first
[1:17:43.320 --> 1:17:48.400]  level of fighting back is there and if I can get that first level and point it at the real
[1:17:48.400 --> 1:17:54.440]  enemy that's engineered all of this and if people politically stand up and say no and
[1:17:54.440 --> 1:17:59.160]  verbally stand up and say no and aggressively put the type of energy into politics in life
[1:17:59.160 --> 1:18:02.480]  that it takes to go burn down a building or attack the police, well our problems will
[1:18:02.480 --> 1:18:07.560]  be over very, very quickly because that's what information war is, that's what info
[1:18:07.560 --> 1:18:16.080]  war is, is aggressively with the truth, burning down lives and if I'm going to get ahead in
[1:18:16.080 --> 1:18:19.800]  life and my kids are going to have a future, I want that poor black lady with her kids
[1:18:19.800 --> 1:18:22.880]  or that poor white lady or that poor Hispanic lady, I want them to have opportunities in
[1:18:22.880 --> 1:18:29.520]  the future, the globalists are making you dependent to take away your opportunities,
[1:18:29.520 --> 1:18:34.520]  I want to empower you and I know you want to be empowered and I know that I'm not going
[1:18:34.520 --> 1:18:39.680]  to sit back and look down on poor people that aren't as advantage as I was and then feel
[1:18:39.680 --> 1:18:45.840]  elitist about myself because I'm more informed and I've got more success than them, I need
[1:18:45.840 --> 1:18:49.560]  to build them up but that doesn't mean build them up with a welfare check that keeps them
[1:18:49.560 --> 1:18:55.160]  at a subservience level and make sure they're slaves, it means I build them up by true education,
[1:18:55.160 --> 1:19:00.280]  true access, true information and a level playing field of competition that allows people
[1:19:00.280 --> 1:19:05.880]  to thrive and discover their own personal power in whatever area they have with gifts
[1:19:05.880 --> 1:19:11.800]  because God gave us all gifts, some of us have more gifts than others, some are stronger
[1:19:11.800 --> 1:19:17.760]  in other areas but all of us have a role to play in God's garden of Eden and it's when
[1:19:17.760 --> 1:19:25.240]  you value everyone and their skill and their special gift and when you value that we're
[1:19:25.240 --> 1:19:31.360]  made the image of God whether you're white or brown or black or yellow and sure there
[1:19:31.360 --> 1:19:34.880]  are brown people that say whites are bad and sure there are whites that say that brown
[1:19:34.880 --> 1:19:38.280]  people are bad and sometimes we're killing each other and it's a real thing when your
[1:19:38.280 --> 1:19:47.440]  fights might end like you but at the end of the day it's a natural course of things
[1:19:47.440 --> 1:19:54.000]  being manipulated and if you want to play chess instead of checkers you got to rise
[1:19:54.000 --> 1:19:59.520]  above it, you got to transcend it and you got to see what it is and then realize they
[1:19:59.520 --> 1:20:02.680]  don't care if you're black or white, older, young, they're putting fluoride in your water,
[1:20:02.680 --> 1:20:07.560]  they don't care if you're Chinese or German or Mexican, they're trying to put deadly vaccines
[1:20:07.560 --> 1:20:11.840]  in you that are taking, they don't care where you came from or what you're doing, there's
[1:20:11.840 --> 1:20:17.480]  a new older club, not even a thousand people are in it and like George Carlin always said
[1:20:17.480 --> 1:20:23.480]  there's a big club and we ain't in it, you got to come back in with that, hello Texan
[1:20:23.480 --> 1:20:29.960]  George Carlin, people don't know that George Carlin was born in New York to an ad executive
[1:20:29.960 --> 1:20:34.080]  dad but he lived most of his life as a kid in Texas, good guy, listen to the show, could
[1:20:34.080 --> 1:20:40.720]  never get him on though, got one interview with him, we'll take your calls on the other
[1:20:40.720 --> 1:20:48.120]  side at 877-789-2539-877-789-Alex and we've got all these clips I haven't gotten to and
[1:20:48.120 --> 1:20:52.240]  we've got so much to cover and so much breaking it in FullWars.com and we'll get into some
[1:20:52.240 --> 1:20:56.080]  of the transcript and now the draft of Trump's executive order that he's going to sign there
[1:20:56.080 --> 1:21:00.960]  tomorrow they're saying, man you talk about, he finally figured out the par scales so I'm
[1:21:00.960 --> 1:21:06.200]  not against, did not get him elected and Trump finally has figured out the internet and how
[1:21:06.200 --> 1:21:09.920]  everything's undercut and he put up with so much that now they're censoring him in
[1:21:09.920 --> 1:21:13.600]  live time, it's taken us a year to let Trump know he's been shadow banned on Twitter, now
[1:21:13.600 --> 1:21:20.920]  they're publicly doing it because he put up with it and so again, the president does
[1:21:20.920 --> 1:21:25.120]  not need to go after these folks on the censorship angle, it's the racketeering, it's the Chinese
[1:21:25.120 --> 1:21:26.120]  agent angle.
[1:21:26.120 --> 1:21:29.720]  All right let me plug for this hour then we'll come back and take your calls, head of a special
[1:21:29.720 --> 1:21:33.560]  guest joining us, we'll continue with calls, you know the guy that did the take on my where

[1:23:38.840 --> 1:23:43.000]  big sales are going to end, take advantage of them now and fund the InfoWars, there's
[1:23:43.000 --> 1:23:48.160]  not a better place to bet your money and strike your stake.
[1:23:48.160 --> 1:23:52.920]  I don't have to tell you that we are in the most important point in human history, the
[1:23:52.920 --> 1:23:57.320]  globalists have taken the gloves off and they've taken the mask off and they're like, yeah,
[1:23:57.320 --> 1:24:01.960]  you're taking implantable chips, yeah, we're in the pedophilia, yeah, we're in the world
[1:24:01.960 --> 1:24:08.160]  government, yeah, you're obsolete, you are non-essential, we are shutting your ass down,
[1:24:08.160 --> 1:24:13.240]  yeah, we told you don't be farmers and don't be ranchers and don't work in industry anymore,
[1:24:13.240 --> 1:24:17.280]  you're going to be the service economy, and now the globalists are telling you that there's
[1:24:17.280 --> 1:24:21.800]  no more service economy and you're obsolete, so you better bow down to them and get your
[1:24:21.800 --> 1:24:27.800]  universal pittance income so they can dictate your life, the handcuffs are going on right
[1:24:27.800 --> 1:24:32.800]  now, we have to resist and say no to the new world order and that takes you understanding
[1:24:32.800 --> 1:24:37.200]  you were right and understanding I was right and getting in people's faces and raising
[1:24:37.200 --> 1:24:42.920]  the alarm now while you still can, now is the time for action, now is the time for you
[1:24:42.920 --> 1:24:48.320]  to shine and be the Paul Revere's you know you are.
[1:24:48.320 --> 1:24:53.160]  Now it's official, the United Nations came out yesterday and said the COVID emergency
[1:24:53.160 --> 1:24:59.280]  will last five years and the UK government said you must all carry cell phones outside
[1:24:59.280 --> 1:25:04.000]  or you'll be arrested because we have to track your social distancing and you're only allowed
[1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:09.000]  to have a list of 10 people that you visit and if you go outside that list of 10 you
[1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:14.680]  will be permanently detained, yes ladies and gentlemen this is the new world order where
[1:25:14.680 --> 1:25:19.480]  they let the criminals out of jail, the rapists, the child molesters, the murderers and where
[1:25:19.480 --> 1:25:23.360]  you are now non-essential and a prisoner.
[1:25:23.360 --> 1:25:27.560]  From the beginning of my research it was clear the globalist are an authoritarian anti-human
[1:25:27.560 --> 1:25:33.640]  group they have to put this electronic straightjacket on us before they carry out their in game
[1:25:33.640 --> 1:25:41.080]  which is global depopulation, so you see submitting to them is death, the only way to stop them
[1:25:41.080 --> 1:25:47.120]  is to expose them to hate their guts and realize they are humanity's mortal enemy, wake up
[1:25:47.120 --> 1:25:49.040]  or die.
[1:25:49.040 --> 1:25:53.720]  What Info Wars has been able to do thanks to your support and your prayers and your word
[1:25:53.720 --> 1:26:00.960]  of mouth has been nothing short of historic and truly epic, this is the battle for the
[1:26:00.960 --> 1:26:08.800]  future of humanity and now open world government is being established with an in game to depopulate
[1:26:08.800 --> 1:26:09.800]  the planet.
[1:26:09.800 --> 1:26:16.560]  Now, the internal operations of the globalist are being externalized, you must decide which
[1:26:16.560 --> 1:26:21.960]  side you are on, living in denial having mass Stockholm syndrome, learned helplessness will
[1:26:21.960 --> 1:26:27.980]  only deliver you into misery, destruction and finally death, and this is a spiritual
[1:26:27.980 --> 1:26:34.680]  death we are talking about, not just a physical death, the delusions must end now, Info Wars
[1:26:34.680 --> 1:26:39.920]  was correct about it all and we have come so far by exposing the enemy, most people
[1:26:39.920 --> 1:26:44.800]  that are aware of the new world will decide to join it out of fear, they are truly fools,
[1:26:44.800 --> 1:26:51.040]  we must fight this or lose our souls.
[1:26:51.040 --> 1:27:09.440]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:27:09.440 --> 1:27:15.720]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[1:27:15.720 --> 1:27:20.920]  Well, I'm reading Trump's executive order, it's strong.
[1:27:20.920 --> 1:27:25.720]  The globalist are, look like a hill of ants that have been stirred up, we're going to your
[1:27:25.720 --> 1:27:30.240]  phone calls here in a moment, but as I mentioned it, here's George Carlin on the globalist
[1:27:30.240 --> 1:27:31.920]  club and we ain't in it.
[1:27:31.920 --> 1:27:41.520]  It's never going to get any better, don't look for it, be happy with what you got, because
[1:27:41.520 --> 1:27:44.760]  the owners of this country don't want that.
[1:27:44.760 --> 1:27:49.960]  I'm talking about the real owners now, the real owners, the big wealthy business and just
[1:27:49.960 --> 1:27:55.040]  that control things and make all the important decisions, forget the politicians, the politicians
[1:27:55.040 --> 1:27:59.320]  are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice.
[1:27:59.320 --> 1:28:07.080]  You don't, you have no choice, you have owners, they own you, they own everything, they own
[1:28:07.080 --> 1:28:11.480]  all the important land, they own and control the corporations, they've long since bought
[1:28:11.480 --> 1:28:14.440]  and paid for the senate, the congress, the state houses, the city halls, they got the
[1:28:14.440 --> 1:28:18.520]  judges in their back pockets and they own all the big media companies so they control
[1:28:18.520 --> 1:28:24.200]  just about all of the news and information you get to hear, they got you by the balls.
[1:28:24.200 --> 1:28:30.160]  They want obedient workers, obedient workers, people who are just smart enough to run the
[1:28:30.160 --> 1:28:35.000]  machines and do the paperwork and just dumb enough to passively accept jobs with the lower
[1:28:35.000 --> 1:28:39.520]  pay, the longer hours to reduce benefits, the end of overtime and the vanishing pension
[1:28:39.520 --> 1:28:43.520]  that disappears the minute you go to collect it and now they're coming for your social
[1:28:43.520 --> 1:28:49.160]  security money so they can give it to their criminal friends on wall street.
[1:28:49.160 --> 1:28:52.080]  It's a big club and you ain't in it.
[1:28:52.080 --> 1:28:57.760]  You said recently, quote, when you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do.
[1:28:57.760 --> 1:28:58.760]  You better believe it.
[1:28:58.760 --> 1:29:01.000]  So what specifically did they do?
[1:29:01.000 --> 1:29:05.120]  If I ask them, if I need them, you know, most of the people on this stage I've given to
[1:29:05.120 --> 1:29:07.640]  just so you understand, a lot of money.
[1:29:07.640 --> 1:29:10.680]  You and I are not in the big club.
[1:29:10.680 --> 1:29:15.360]  The owners of this country know the truth, it's called the American dream because you
[1:29:15.360 --> 1:29:18.440]  have to be asleep to believe it.
[1:29:18.440 --> 1:29:20.280]  But I'll tell you what, they don't want it.
[1:29:20.280 --> 1:29:23.760]  They don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking.
[1:29:23.760 --> 1:29:27.640]  They don't want well-informed, well-educated people capable of critical thinking.
[1:29:27.640 --> 1:29:28.640]  They're not interested in that.
[1:29:28.640 --> 1:29:29.640]  That doesn't help them.
[1:29:29.640 --> 1:29:30.640]  That's against their interest.
[1:29:30.640 --> 1:29:31.640]  That's right.
[1:29:31.640 --> 1:29:39.640]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[1:29:39.640 --> 1:29:43.400]  They were planning on leaving the old system into one even worse and Trump's trying to
[1:29:43.400 --> 1:29:44.400]  block that.
[1:29:44.400 --> 1:29:47.480]  We're trying to block that and go back to the Renaissance.
[1:29:47.480 --> 1:29:54.080]  A system never completely realized but partially realized that created incredible freedom.
[1:29:54.080 --> 1:29:55.480]  I will get to this executive order.
[1:29:55.480 --> 1:29:56.480]  I've been reading it.
[1:29:56.480 --> 1:29:57.480]  It's up on infowars.com.
[1:29:57.480 --> 1:29:59.040]  Here's Business Insider.
[1:29:59.040 --> 1:30:02.600]  Trump's executive order is pushing social media titans, Mark Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey
[1:30:02.600 --> 1:30:05.320]  to clash over how they handle free speech.
[1:30:05.320 --> 1:30:06.320]  Let's put a clip here in a moment.
[1:30:06.320 --> 1:30:15.560]  Let me go to your calls of Zuckerberg saying, oh, no, our platforms shouldn't be publishers.
[1:30:15.560 --> 1:30:17.640]  We shouldn't control people saying unless it's illegal.
[1:30:17.640 --> 1:30:19.120]  He's already doing that.
[1:30:19.120 --> 1:30:20.560]  He's playing the good cop.
[1:30:20.560 --> 1:30:23.920]  Jack Dorsey, who was Mr. Free Speech, Twitter was the Free Speech Bastion.
[1:30:23.920 --> 1:30:25.120]  He's now playing the bad cop.
[1:30:25.120 --> 1:30:26.120]  Here it is.
[1:30:26.120 --> 1:30:32.720]  To fact check one of President Trump's tweets, I wondered if you thought that Twitter may
[1:30:32.720 --> 1:30:34.360]  have made the wrong decision here.
[1:30:34.360 --> 1:30:37.680]  We have a different policy, I think, than Twitter on this.
[1:30:37.680 --> 1:30:44.640]  I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that
[1:30:44.640 --> 1:30:45.640]  people say online.
[1:30:45.640 --> 1:30:50.560]  I think in general, private companies probably shouldn't be, or especially these platform
[1:30:50.560 --> 1:30:56.560]  companies, shouldn't be in the position of doing that.
[1:30:56.560 --> 1:30:59.400]  If anybody has data from Star Trek, it's Zuckerberg.
[1:30:59.400 --> 1:31:00.400]  I mean, wow.
[1:31:00.400 --> 1:31:03.440]  Oh, but he's the savior now.
[1:31:03.440 --> 1:31:05.080]  That's one of the worst out there censoring.
[1:31:05.080 --> 1:31:07.840]  So that's the game they're playing on Trump.
[1:31:07.840 --> 1:31:10.360]  Let's go to your phone calls right now.
[1:31:10.360 --> 1:31:16.720]  For me, I'd say go after them on sympathizing with the Chai comms, censoring with communist
[1:31:16.720 --> 1:31:19.520]  Chinese keywords, things that criticize Xi Jinping.
[1:31:19.520 --> 1:31:20.520]  I mean, that's confirmed.
[1:31:20.520 --> 1:31:23.000]  See, that's the thing.
[1:31:23.000 --> 1:31:27.480]  If the government doesn't stand up for speech, other governments come in and they dictate.
[1:31:27.480 --> 1:31:29.560]  That's what I've been saying.
[1:31:29.560 --> 1:31:32.120]  And now Senator Hawley and others get that.
[1:31:32.120 --> 1:31:33.120]  This isn't about speech.
[1:31:33.120 --> 1:31:34.880]  It's about espionage, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:31:34.880 --> 1:31:35.880]  It's about racketeering.
[1:31:35.880 --> 1:31:38.760]  It's about a bunch of companies getting together and creating a cartel.
[1:31:38.760 --> 1:31:39.880]  It's bigger than a trust.
[1:31:39.880 --> 1:31:41.800]  It's bigger than a monopoly.
[1:31:41.800 --> 1:31:43.960]  It's a total fuck control system.
[1:31:43.960 --> 1:31:47.400]  And the average person that's 60, 70, 80, it's not a big internet person like Trump's
[1:31:47.400 --> 1:31:49.760]  like, oh, the internet, it's that side thing.
[1:31:49.760 --> 1:31:53.760]  Trump has to understand the internet is hundreds of times bigger than Fox News.
[1:31:53.760 --> 1:32:01.320]  So they tried to use that blind spot on Trump, but now he sees what's happening and his constituents
[1:32:01.320 --> 1:32:05.520]  everywhere he goes and the emails and calls he gets are do something.
[1:32:05.520 --> 1:32:09.240]  I can't send out a link to your speech on Facebook or Twitter and Trump then sees it
[1:32:09.240 --> 1:32:13.680]  himself.
[1:32:13.680 --> 1:32:15.920]  Not much time, El Presidente.
[1:32:15.920 --> 1:32:18.280]  They're going to steal that election from you.
[1:32:18.280 --> 1:32:26.840]  Just as sure, just as sure as the Nile is a river in Egypt going to happen.
[1:32:26.840 --> 1:32:27.840]  They're making their move.
[1:32:27.840 --> 1:32:33.920]  They're bragging about it, buddy boy.
[1:32:33.920 --> 1:32:36.200]  Carlos in Canada is a long time caller.
[1:32:36.200 --> 1:32:37.200]  Always has a lot to say.
[1:32:37.200 --> 1:32:38.200]  Carlos, you're on the air.
[1:32:38.200 --> 1:32:39.200]  Thanks for calling.
[1:32:39.200 --> 1:32:40.200]  Hello, Alex.
[1:32:40.200 --> 1:32:41.200]  Welcome.
[1:32:41.200 --> 1:32:45.760]  President Trump has had a weakness from the very, very beginning and that is that it's
[1:32:45.760 --> 1:32:51.720]  an independent candidate coming into an election for the presidency of the United States.
[1:32:51.720 --> 1:32:57.320]  He didn't have the personal infrastructure that comes along with being senator or being
[1:32:57.320 --> 1:33:00.160]  a politician, you know, in the business.
[1:33:00.160 --> 1:33:02.800]  He didn't have a history of people he could trust, a network.
[1:33:02.800 --> 1:33:04.680]  Yeah, he didn't have a lot of people.
[1:33:04.680 --> 1:33:11.040]  As a matter of fact, he's still relying on the very few people, family members, basically
[1:33:11.040 --> 1:33:14.440]  to rely on applying division.
[1:33:14.440 --> 1:33:18.680]  This is not something that makes the presidency of the United States strong.
[1:33:18.680 --> 1:33:21.400]  So they, from the very beginning, those who opposed it.
[1:33:21.400 --> 1:33:24.000]  And that's why they flipped out on him trying to bring Flynn in because he was about to
[1:33:24.000 --> 1:33:25.640]  bring in a bunch of loyal Americans.
[1:33:25.640 --> 1:33:27.160]  Yes, that's correct.
[1:33:27.160 --> 1:33:34.040]  And it's taken four years and he has done an extraordinary work because he really is
[1:33:34.040 --> 1:33:37.520]  the president of the people, the president of the United States.
[1:33:37.520 --> 1:33:39.640]  There's no question about that.
[1:33:39.640 --> 1:33:44.480]  The Democrats, as you know, in the car race, when you have a car that comes out of nowhere
[1:33:44.480 --> 1:33:49.080]  and gets ahead of you and you're leading and now you're second, the last thing you do is
[1:33:49.080 --> 1:33:50.680]  to do stupid things.
[1:33:50.680 --> 1:33:53.680]  You just get the draft behind the leading car.
[1:33:53.680 --> 1:33:57.560]  You follow everything and from time to time, you wait for the opportunity to pass.
[1:33:57.560 --> 1:33:59.280]  The Democrats should have done that.
[1:33:59.280 --> 1:34:02.600]  Simply follow the president, be supportive when he's wanting to.
[1:34:02.600 --> 1:34:03.600]  Exactly.
[1:34:03.600 --> 1:34:05.200]  They should have become him.
[1:34:05.200 --> 1:34:06.200]  That's right.
[1:34:06.200 --> 1:34:07.200]  But they did not.
[1:34:07.200 --> 1:34:08.720]  They decided to go opposite.
[1:34:08.720 --> 1:34:13.200]  And it raises some questions, questions that today are very relevant.
[1:34:13.200 --> 1:34:18.480]  And to me personally, I always wondered, why don't we look at the birth certificate of
[1:34:18.480 --> 1:34:23.240]  people like, let's say, I don't know, Madame Obama.
[1:34:23.240 --> 1:34:25.200]  I'd like to see her birth certificate.
[1:34:25.200 --> 1:34:31.440]  I'd like to see, you know, things like a T-shirt that says, you know, Joe Biden, you know,
[1:34:31.440 --> 1:34:34.960]  hands off children or, you know, something like that.
[1:34:34.960 --> 1:34:43.440]  Because frankly, the media is in cahoots with people who are questioned, very questionable.
[1:34:43.440 --> 1:34:44.440]  And this background is not-
[1:34:44.440 --> 1:34:45.440]  Oh, it's very obvious.
[1:34:45.440 --> 1:34:49.360]  You've got a bunch of blackmailed perverts, pedophiles.
[1:34:49.360 --> 1:34:51.320]  This is a party of pedophiles.
[1:34:51.320 --> 1:34:52.320]  Correct.
[1:34:52.320 --> 1:34:57.920]  And in my opinion, the President of the United States right now is facing the largest challenge,
[1:34:57.920 --> 1:34:59.240]  the greatest challenge.
[1:34:59.240 --> 1:35:03.760]  You know, the days of a president running in a convertible are gone, okay?
[1:35:03.760 --> 1:35:08.320]  If you wanted to physically kill the President of the United States today, you only have
[1:35:08.320 --> 1:35:10.080]  one basic alternative.
[1:35:10.080 --> 1:35:11.600]  I'd put that through my algorithm.
[1:35:11.600 --> 1:35:15.080]  You know, I have a little computer algorithm that I developed years ago.
[1:35:15.080 --> 1:35:17.040]  There's a semantic analysis.
[1:35:17.040 --> 1:35:19.200]  And two words came out.
[1:35:19.200 --> 1:35:23.840]  Hariri was one, and Carrero Blanco was the other.
[1:35:23.840 --> 1:35:27.880]  Why did these two words come from all of the, you know, semantic analysis?
[1:35:27.880 --> 1:35:33.600]  And it was that these two people were blown up from underneath the road, the car threw
[1:35:33.600 --> 1:35:34.600]  in the air.
[1:35:34.600 --> 1:35:35.600]  You said it.
[1:35:35.600 --> 1:35:39.360]  I swear, I was thinking that they would either blow up his car or his helicopter earlier.
[1:35:39.360 --> 1:35:40.680]  I almost said that exactly.
[1:35:40.680 --> 1:35:42.680]  IED is what you've got to worry about.
[1:35:42.680 --> 1:35:43.680]  Yes.
[1:35:43.680 --> 1:35:44.880]  And I'm very worried about that.
[1:35:44.880 --> 1:35:48.880]  And you know, there are certain sinister people that have come into the equation.
[1:35:48.880 --> 1:35:51.800]  I don't want to mention or insinuate anything.
[1:35:51.800 --> 1:35:52.800]  Believe me, I don't.
[1:35:52.800 --> 1:35:54.440]  I don't question their integrity or anything.
[1:35:54.440 --> 1:35:58.960]  I'm just saying to you that General McChrystal, very suspect, okay?
[1:35:58.960 --> 1:36:03.440]  He was involved in two instances of a journalist that hits a tree at high speed at night in
[1:36:03.440 --> 1:36:04.440]  California.
[1:36:04.440 --> 1:36:05.440]  Michael Hastings.
[1:36:05.440 --> 1:36:06.440]  He doesn't know how that happened.
[1:36:06.440 --> 1:36:07.440]  You know?
[1:36:07.440 --> 1:36:11.480]  And you know, just because he was the one that outed him in a sense, and a football player
[1:36:11.480 --> 1:36:17.280]  that was killed with friendly fire, you know, in Afghanistan, you know, a very famous football
[1:36:17.280 --> 1:36:18.280]  player.
[1:36:18.280 --> 1:36:19.280]  Right, NFL.
[1:36:19.280 --> 1:36:20.280]  Mr. Tillman.
[1:36:20.280 --> 1:36:23.400]  And you know, and I'm wondering, why are these people coming to this scene right now against
[1:36:23.400 --> 1:36:24.400]  the president?
[1:36:24.400 --> 1:36:25.400]  I really wonder.
[1:36:25.400 --> 1:36:29.440]  Because, you know, and I'm saying anything, Mr. McChrystal, General McChrystal, we're
[1:36:29.440 --> 1:36:30.440]  involved.
[1:36:30.440 --> 1:36:31.440]  I just don't think anything happens to Trump.
[1:36:31.440 --> 1:36:32.440]  We know who's the enemy.
[1:36:32.440 --> 1:36:33.440]  All right.
[1:36:33.440 --> 1:36:34.440]  Incredible Carlos.
[1:36:34.440 --> 1:36:35.440]  What an amazing call.
[1:36:35.440 --> 1:36:36.440]  Ha-ha.
[1:36:36.440 --> 1:36:40.840]  We'll be right back with more of your phone calls and a special guest pop send in more
[1:36:40.840 --> 1:36:41.840]  phone calls.
[1:36:41.840 --> 1:36:49.400]  MFullWars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[1:36:49.400 --> 1:36:54.280]  We're living in insanely dangerous times, and I told folks going back three months ago,
[1:36:54.280 --> 1:36:57.680]  I'm not buying storeable food because I'm worried about the COVID-19 virus.
[1:36:57.680 --> 1:37:00.640]  I'm worried about the food shortages and the economic collapse.
[1:37:00.640 --> 1:37:05.080]  And now it's admitted that a chain reaction has begun that's already caused food shortages
[1:37:05.080 --> 1:37:08.800]  and the collapse of farms and ranches across the United States, and it's even worse in
[1:37:08.800 --> 1:37:09.800]  the third world.
[1:37:09.800 --> 1:37:13.320]  So, Trump, with his initiatives, could clean this up and fix it, but with the election
[1:37:13.320 --> 1:37:17.880]  fraud and the COVID-19, all the wars and the third world collapsing and everything else
[1:37:17.880 --> 1:37:23.200]  is going on, now is the time to get storeable foods because they'll last for 25 years.
[1:37:23.200 --> 1:37:25.200]  They're in easily totable bags.
[1:37:25.200 --> 1:37:29.000]  It's high-quality food, and it's good to have that box checked off to be ready, and it funds
[1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:30.000]  the MFullWars.
[1:37:30.000 --> 1:37:34.840]  So, we have storeable food available again, MFullWars.com, or call toll-free, AAA-253-3139,
[1:37:34.840 --> 1:37:39.080]  but whatever you do, get prepared and get ready because the globalists want you dependent
[1:37:39.080 --> 1:37:40.080]  on them.
[1:37:40.080 --> 1:37:41.080]  They do not want you to be self-sufficient.
[1:37:41.080 --> 1:37:48.720]  Get your storeable food at MFullWars.com right now while you still can.
[1:37:48.720 --> 1:37:54.680]  As I record this announcement, there's only one week left in the biggest sale yet of 2020.
[1:37:54.680 --> 1:38:00.720]  We will not have this sale that's coming on right now in May until our Christmas sale
[1:38:00.720 --> 1:38:01.720]  comes up.
[1:38:01.720 --> 1:38:07.560]  All of our best-selling supplements are 30 to 60 percent off at MFullWars.com.
[1:38:07.560 --> 1:38:12.880]  Let me just hone in on one of the products, DNA Force Plus.
[1:38:12.880 --> 1:38:18.040]  It's got high-quality PQQ, CoQ10, and a bunch of other natural ingredients that are known
[1:38:18.040 --> 1:38:20.480]  to supercharge the effects of that.
[1:38:20.480 --> 1:38:26.000]  Learn what PQQ and CoQ10 can do for you no matter how old you are, no matter what color

[1:38:30.840 --> 1:38:33.400]  It's known to be able to regrow nerves.
[1:38:33.400 --> 1:38:36.800]  It's designed so that your telomeres last longer.
[1:38:36.800 --> 1:38:41.400]  As it makes them grow, it makes them shrink slower, which is basically the same thing.
[1:38:41.400 --> 1:38:48.360]  DNA Force Plus is 50 percent off for a limited time at MFullWars.com.
[1:38:48.360 --> 1:38:53.080]  I was talking to my wife tonight and I was saying, our economy slowing down and shutting
[1:38:53.080 --> 1:38:58.040]  down is like shooting a deer and it runs 100 yards before it knows it's been shot and then
[1:38:58.040 --> 1:38:59.040]  it finally dies.
[1:38:59.040 --> 1:39:03.680]  She said, well, yeah, when I grew up in Omaha, Nebraska, one time there was an argument in
[1:39:03.680 --> 1:39:08.280]  the street and another man shot another man in the head and the man that got shot in the
[1:39:08.280 --> 1:39:12.000]  head had blood pouring out, a huge hole, and he was holding it.
[1:39:12.000 --> 1:39:16.840]  He walked around gibbering, talking nonsense for about 60 seconds, and then just fell over
[1:39:16.840 --> 1:39:17.840]  dead.
[1:39:17.840 --> 1:39:20.240]  Well, that's what's going to happen with our economy.
[1:39:20.240 --> 1:39:21.720]  It is in cardiac arrest.
[1:39:21.720 --> 1:39:27.400]  This has been done by design and the UN, the Chi Coms, the mainstream media orchestrated
[1:39:27.400 --> 1:39:30.520]  it, hyped it, and tried to keep the economy closed.
[1:39:30.520 --> 1:39:35.080]  But remember, the depression that's coming and the third world collapse is all on the
[1:39:35.080 --> 1:39:41.280]  UN, on Bill and Melinda Gates, on Obama, on Hillary, on Biden, on the Democrats.
[1:39:41.280 --> 1:39:42.280]  We tried to stop it.
[1:39:42.280 --> 1:39:43.280]  We tried to fight it.
[1:39:43.280 --> 1:39:47.040]  But you guys have said you wanted to wreck America and the world and now you've done
[1:39:47.040 --> 1:39:48.040]  it.
[1:39:48.040 --> 1:39:49.040]  Congratulations.
[1:39:49.040 --> 1:39:54.200]  The panic that has been orchestrated by the global, corporatist media and the Chi Coms
[1:39:54.200 --> 1:39:57.880]  is going to now trigger a worldwide depression.
[1:39:57.880 --> 1:40:01.640]  In fact, we're already into the worldwide depression and the death sentence for the
[1:40:01.640 --> 1:40:02.640]  third world.
[1:40:02.640 --> 1:40:08.320]  But it's critical to understand that the longer the shutdown persists, the worse it's going
[1:40:08.320 --> 1:40:09.320]  to be.
[1:40:09.320 --> 1:40:14.440]  A month of shutdown will destroy decades of wealth that's been built up in a complex
[1:40:14.440 --> 1:40:15.440]  economy.
[1:40:15.440 --> 1:40:19.480]  That's what we've always said it's important to be a prepper and to be somewhat self-sufficient
[1:40:19.480 --> 1:40:24.240]  because the globalists want to make us all dependent so that we're under their control.
[1:40:24.240 --> 1:40:26.600]  They've admitted all of this.
[1:40:26.600 --> 1:40:32.680]  So remember, how does M4s continue years and decades in many cases to be able to predict
[1:40:32.680 --> 1:40:34.640]  things before they happen?
[1:40:34.640 --> 1:40:39.480]  Because we're following the globalist blueprint and their battle plan and yes, it's dystopic
[1:40:39.480 --> 1:40:40.920]  and yes, it's scary.
[1:40:40.920 --> 1:40:45.080]  But denying it and letting them carry it out is a thousand times more scary.
[1:40:45.080 --> 1:40:51.960]  It's time to stop the denial and realize what's really happening.
[1:40:51.960 --> 1:41:06.800]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:41:06.800 --> 1:41:11.400]  We don't want to get behind the curve here.
[1:41:11.400 --> 1:41:20.040]  COVID and the Chicom operation is still wreaking havoc, but America and the people out of the
[1:41:20.040 --> 1:41:23.960]  upper hand, the hoax is beginning to dissipate.
[1:41:23.960 --> 1:41:29.720]  We can see you to expose it hard though, but we've got the initiative and the enemy can
[1:41:29.720 --> 1:41:35.840]  see that we've turned the tide again thanks to God, thanks to God's impetus to make us
[1:41:35.840 --> 1:41:38.840]  take action, the animating spirit.
[1:41:38.840 --> 1:41:47.320]  So we better start asking the enemy's next move because by the time the bombers have
[1:41:47.320 --> 1:41:59.040]  left that are bombing us now, you better believe the next sortie has been launched.
[1:41:59.040 --> 1:42:05.520]  And I think Carlos is a very smart person and I think yeah, that's how they'll get
[1:42:05.520 --> 1:42:18.280]  Trump is in improvised explosive devices that have already been buried in hundreds of spots
[1:42:18.280 --> 1:42:26.720]  months ago with operatives inside construction crews on normal construction routes.
[1:42:26.720 --> 1:42:30.960]  The Secret Service should, I think you probably thought of this, route the president around
[1:42:30.960 --> 1:42:34.600]  any recent construction sites the last six months.
[1:42:34.600 --> 1:42:35.600]  I'm serious.
[1:42:35.600 --> 1:42:39.880]  Obviously, they got decoy helicopters and a lot of other things, but I don't say speed
[1:42:39.880 --> 1:42:43.360]  or mad at folks this, they're going to try to kill Trump.
[1:42:43.360 --> 1:42:44.560]  They're losing their piss.
[1:42:44.560 --> 1:42:45.560]  They don't know what to do.
[1:42:45.560 --> 1:42:50.920]  There's a lot of things Trump could do to go on the offense, which I'm not an offensive
[1:42:50.920 --> 1:42:51.920]  guy.
[1:42:51.920 --> 1:42:57.720]  I'm use the cheesy analogy, use the force for knowledge and defense, never to attack.
[1:42:57.720 --> 1:42:59.680]  We're under attack.
[1:42:59.680 --> 1:43:03.080]  So the idea that when someone's attacking you, you don't fight back, you just wait for the
[1:43:03.080 --> 1:43:05.400]  next attack and only make one move after you've been attacked.
[1:43:05.400 --> 1:43:07.920]  No, once you open the attack, everything else is defense.
[1:43:07.920 --> 1:43:10.480]  It may look like offense, but it's defense.
[1:43:10.480 --> 1:43:15.400]  You open the Virginia bottle, you open the gate, you get it.
[1:43:15.400 --> 1:43:21.600]  And Trump's just surrounded by cards.
[1:43:21.600 --> 1:43:28.440]  He's got some good people, but I mean, I'll just tell you this, having Phil Mudd walking
[1:43:28.440 --> 1:43:32.560]  around on CNN, you know, when he used to run CIA, assassin teams saying he's going to kill
[1:43:32.560 --> 1:43:33.560]  the president.
[1:43:33.560 --> 1:43:37.400]  I mean, come on, that dude shouldn't be, I mean, that just the fact that he's walking
[1:43:37.400 --> 1:43:38.920]  around is like a green light to everybody.
[1:43:38.920 --> 1:43:41.160]  Oh God, the president's an idiot and he's weak.
[1:43:41.160 --> 1:43:42.960]  I mean, this guy says kill the president.
[1:43:42.960 --> 1:43:43.960]  He's still walking around.
[1:43:43.960 --> 1:43:48.560]  I mean, if I got on there and said kill Trump and I said, go get him and I'd run CIA kill
[1:43:48.560 --> 1:43:49.560]  teams.
[1:43:49.560 --> 1:43:53.440]  I mean, I should be arrested within hours.
[1:43:53.440 --> 1:43:57.280]  And the fact that that guy is walking around right there, it's everything you need to know
[1:43:57.280 --> 1:43:59.640]  right there.
[1:43:59.640 --> 1:44:05.160]  What happens to the president though, your name is mud buddy.
[1:44:05.160 --> 1:44:06.440]  He never killed anybody himself though.
[1:44:06.440 --> 1:44:11.120]  He just sent people to do it and he shoots his mouth all day about how tough he is.
[1:44:11.120 --> 1:44:16.440]  But all the bravada and all the hoods for the globalist, I'm so sick.
[1:44:16.440 --> 1:44:18.320]  I want to call their bluff, man.
[1:44:18.320 --> 1:44:20.000]  This whole operation is about doing that.
[1:44:20.000 --> 1:44:26.200]  And I know you're calling their bluff and I love you, but man, I just, they teach people
[1:44:26.200 --> 1:44:28.760]  to go burn down targets and shoot cops as a protest.
[1:44:28.760 --> 1:44:29.760]  That's not how you do it.
[1:44:29.760 --> 1:44:34.200]  And I don't want any violence, but for everybody out there that wants to know, I mean, obviously
[1:44:34.200 --> 1:44:38.080]  you don't burn down local police station or fire department and burn down somebody's business
[1:44:38.080 --> 1:44:39.720]  if you're going after the establishment.
[1:44:39.720 --> 1:44:43.200]  You find out who are the bad guys that did bad policies that screwed your rights and
[1:44:43.200 --> 1:44:44.200]  your freedom.
[1:44:44.200 --> 1:44:45.200]  And then you go find them.
[1:44:45.200 --> 1:44:49.360]  And I'm not saying do that, but this is a time to be like Santa Claus.
[1:44:49.360 --> 1:44:50.360]  He's got a list.
[1:44:50.360 --> 1:44:52.640]  He checks it twice.
[1:44:52.640 --> 1:44:54.600]  He knows who's been naughty and nice.
[1:44:54.600 --> 1:44:56.520]  They want this world of civil war.
[1:44:56.520 --> 1:44:58.520]  They want this world of assassinations.
[1:44:58.520 --> 1:45:01.760]  They want this world where they're going to kill Trump.
[1:45:01.760 --> 1:45:02.920]  Okay.
[1:45:02.920 --> 1:45:08.280]  I'll be your Huckleberry.
[1:45:08.280 --> 1:45:16.440]  Just pull your pistol, fill the hands and see what happens because I know what America
[1:45:16.440 --> 1:45:20.360]  is going to do to you, but I'm worried about the nuclear weapons and the bio and just all
[1:45:20.360 --> 1:45:21.360]  of it.
[1:45:21.360 --> 1:45:22.360]  It was so damn surrounded.
[1:45:22.360 --> 1:45:25.800]  And I just wish the average American would just wake up and join the Republic and throw
[1:45:25.800 --> 1:45:29.960]  off the chai comms and all this race war crap and come together and have a future.
[1:45:29.960 --> 1:45:35.560]  But no, no, no, the dirty universities and the robber barons had their dream of world
[1:45:35.560 --> 1:45:36.560]  government.
[1:45:36.560 --> 1:45:39.960]  So to have their world government, they had to set up America and take us down and do
[1:45:39.960 --> 1:45:40.960]  all this.
[1:45:40.960 --> 1:45:41.960]  Well, guess what?
[1:45:41.960 --> 1:45:43.760]  America ain't lying down and dying.
[1:45:43.760 --> 1:45:44.760]  Like you knew what our folks want.
[1:45:44.760 --> 1:45:45.760]  All right.
[1:45:45.760 --> 1:45:46.760]  I'm going to your calls.
[1:45:46.760 --> 1:45:47.760]  I'm going to your calls.
[1:45:47.760 --> 1:45:52.760]  Let's go ahead and talk to Baker says, what is the next move for the Globals?
[1:45:52.760 --> 1:45:55.560]  I want to hear what you think from California.
[1:45:55.560 --> 1:45:57.800]  Tell me.
[1:45:57.800 --> 1:45:58.800]  What up, Alex?
[1:45:58.800 --> 1:46:00.720]  I normally call in as Matt from California.
[1:46:00.720 --> 1:46:04.000]  I'm going to go with Baker now because it's a little bit more noticeable.
[1:46:04.000 --> 1:46:11.000]  My opinion is that the contact tracing selective enforcement program will be coming.
[1:46:11.000 --> 1:46:12.720]  And I've already seen it happen.
[1:46:12.720 --> 1:46:13.720]  They'll do.
[1:46:13.720 --> 1:46:18.520]  They'll say, oh, the church, there was a church service and we've covered us in political
[1:46:18.520 --> 1:46:19.520]  agents to your house.
[1:46:19.520 --> 1:46:24.080]  It's just, it's just, it's their secret police, secret army, domestic security force, bigger
[1:46:24.080 --> 1:46:25.960]  than our military Obama plan.
[1:46:25.960 --> 1:46:29.200]  It's community organizers with law enforcement power.
[1:46:29.200 --> 1:46:33.920]  And then they had the blue angels fly over the hospitals and they had big crowds outside
[1:46:33.920 --> 1:46:35.960]  and there was never any talk about that.
[1:46:35.960 --> 1:46:39.360]  And I can bet you there's probably not going to be any talk about the right because it's
[1:46:39.360 --> 1:46:40.360]  all total crap.
[1:46:40.360 --> 1:46:42.920]  And then we go, oh, you're against the blue angels.
[1:46:42.920 --> 1:46:45.160]  The blue angels all knew it was BS.
[1:46:45.160 --> 1:46:46.160]  Yeah.
[1:46:46.160 --> 1:46:51.200]  This contact tracing thing has to be the number one thing that we have to take down.
[1:46:51.200 --> 1:46:53.760]  It's number one enemy to America right now.
[1:46:53.760 --> 1:47:00.160]  I'd like to just switch gears if you would be so kind to the Marlena Beast real quick.
[1:47:00.160 --> 1:47:05.280]  When John was on Patmos and he had his visions, we talked about the fallen one.
[1:47:05.280 --> 1:47:06.280]  Okay.
[1:47:06.280 --> 1:47:09.040]  Now we, a lot of people talk about that possibly being an alien.
[1:47:09.040 --> 1:47:10.040]  Okay.
[1:47:10.040 --> 1:47:11.360]  So an alien lives a really long time.
[1:47:11.360 --> 1:47:15.400]  Is it not possible that that was in fact predictive programming?
[1:47:15.400 --> 1:47:19.880]  Consider that it was not actually in the original Bible that it was written in later.
[1:47:19.880 --> 1:47:24.120]  They said, when the Mark and the Beast comes, it's going to be great because then Jesus
[1:47:24.120 --> 1:47:25.360]  will come and save you.
[1:47:25.360 --> 1:47:26.360]  It's like Q.
[1:47:26.360 --> 1:47:27.360]  It's like Trump.
[1:47:27.360 --> 1:47:32.600]  It's when the final key to the door, when you see the prison guard locking the gate,
[1:47:32.600 --> 1:47:35.560]  that's when you know it's all going to be okay.
[1:47:35.560 --> 1:47:36.800]  And so they set it up.
[1:47:36.800 --> 1:47:41.320]  And then when it's happening, the Christians stand down, the Q stand down, the Trump stand
[1:47:41.320 --> 1:47:42.320]  down.
[1:47:42.320 --> 1:47:43.320]  We are Q.
[1:47:43.320 --> 1:47:44.520]  We are the answer.
[1:47:44.520 --> 1:47:45.520]  We have to do this on a-
[1:47:45.520 --> 1:47:50.280]  Well, no, I mean, I hear what you're saying in that definitely with the Q thing, oh, don't
[1:47:50.280 --> 1:47:51.720]  worry, it's all being handled for you.
[1:47:51.720 --> 1:47:56.000]  And definitely with the pre-rapture, which isn't in the Bible that says that, you know,
[1:47:56.000 --> 1:48:00.120]  there's Armageddon and the archangel ties up Satan and puts them in the pit.
[1:48:00.120 --> 1:48:03.240]  And then the dead in Christ or risen, a five-year-old can understand that.
[1:48:03.240 --> 1:48:08.480]  So definitely pre-privileged rapture is a Q type deal.
[1:48:08.480 --> 1:48:14.760]  And so yeah, you're talking about a missionary that protectorate pre-programming.
[1:48:14.760 --> 1:48:16.800]  I mean, what do you think?
[1:48:16.800 --> 1:48:21.160]  Well, I got something to say because Bill Gates is on the phone now and he wants to
[1:48:21.160 --> 1:48:22.160]  talk.
[1:48:22.160 --> 1:48:30.320]  What I want to do is I want to take my vaccine and I want to impregnate everybody in the
[1:48:30.320 --> 1:48:35.160]  world with a fragment of my RNA DNA.
[1:48:35.160 --> 1:48:43.440]  So I will be like the Anunnaki of the days of old, where I will change the genetic code
[1:48:43.440 --> 1:48:48.160]  of every human being and what's wrong with that?
[1:48:48.160 --> 1:48:52.760]  Well, that's what him and old pervert Epstein were doing.
[1:48:52.760 --> 1:48:54.480]  Now Epstein lawyer came out and said he was murdered.
[1:48:54.480 --> 1:48:55.640]  Of course we know he was murdered.
[1:48:55.640 --> 1:48:59.600]  He was planning to fight the case and he bring everybody down with him so they broke his
[1:48:59.600 --> 1:49:00.600]  little chicken neck.
[1:49:00.600 --> 1:49:01.600]  All right.
[1:49:01.600 --> 1:49:04.440]  I appreciate your call, Baker.
[1:49:04.440 --> 1:49:06.120]  Let's talk to Rudy in Connecticut.
[1:49:06.120 --> 1:49:07.120]  What's happening next?
[1:49:07.120 --> 1:49:09.680]  What do you think their next big move is going to be, Rudy?
[1:49:09.680 --> 1:49:12.680]  Hey, Alex.
[1:49:12.680 --> 1:49:15.720]  I think they telegraphed already what they're going to be doing.
[1:49:15.720 --> 1:49:21.840]  It looks like there's going to be a second wave and a new release of a new bio weapon
[1:49:21.840 --> 1:49:24.840]  and that's going to come close to the fall.
[1:49:24.840 --> 1:49:26.880]  Exactly.
[1:49:26.880 --> 1:49:31.080]  Not just race riots, not just economy war, but a second spike and then they have this
[1:49:31.080 --> 1:49:35.240]  patented new, more deadly version and then we all deny it and say it's not a problem
[1:49:35.240 --> 1:49:37.400]  and then it really hits.
[1:49:37.400 --> 1:49:38.400]  Absolutely.
[1:49:38.400 --> 1:49:47.440]  And then Fauci is a hero wearing that little mask while Fauci is a pure intellectual list.
[1:49:47.440 --> 1:49:54.760]  You could see with the race riots, this is just Ferguson, you know, two, you know, Ferguson
[1:49:54.760 --> 1:49:59.320]  two, and they didn't, it didn't work with the Ahmed Aubrey thing.
[1:49:59.320 --> 1:50:05.200]  So they had to start something else and launch a new offensive, start a race riot, hit us
[1:50:05.200 --> 1:50:12.040]  with a second bio weapon and by the winter or by the fall, when if Trump is reelected,
[1:50:12.040 --> 1:50:14.200]  it's going to get even worse.
[1:50:14.200 --> 1:50:19.960]  And let's just hope that Trump does get reelected and Trump does something to stop it before
[1:50:19.960 --> 1:50:25.400]  I totally agree with you.
[1:50:25.400 --> 1:50:28.680]  So many people think now, oh, it's okay.
[1:50:28.680 --> 1:50:30.680]  Oh, they're starting to turn the economy back on.
[1:50:30.680 --> 1:50:33.400]  They did that after they knew it was going to be a depression.
[1:50:33.400 --> 1:50:35.400]  And so it's going to get very, very intense.
[1:50:35.400 --> 1:50:39.080]  And that's what we have to all expose it as a hoax and say no matter how bad this next
[1:50:39.080 --> 1:50:41.800]  thing is, it came out of Wuhan.
[1:50:41.800 --> 1:50:47.280]  You guys covered it up Fauci and Obama were involved and just keep exposing them and Gates
[1:50:47.280 --> 1:50:50.720]  is the ringleader and they may back off because if they don't think they're going to be able
[1:50:50.720 --> 1:50:57.320]  to sell it as our saviors, they'll have to back off Rudy, do you agree with that statement?
[1:50:57.320 --> 1:50:58.440]  Yeah, absolutely.
[1:50:58.440 --> 1:51:03.320]  And I also want to mention that the American leftist and the postmodernist have left
[1:51:03.320 --> 1:51:08.400]  the door open for the communist Chinese and we're completely infiltrated.
[1:51:08.400 --> 1:51:13.480]  The more that Trump and most people talk about how the communist Chinese have infiltrated
[1:51:13.480 --> 1:51:17.960]  the United States, I think more people are going to wake up to that fact and people should
[1:51:17.960 --> 1:51:22.120]  really be aware of how close we are of losing the whole story.
[1:51:22.120 --> 1:51:24.240]  Oh yeah, this is the third world war.
[1:51:24.240 --> 1:51:25.480]  This is the globalist takeover.
[1:51:25.480 --> 1:51:26.480]  This is everything.
[1:51:26.480 --> 1:51:27.480]  It's now.
[1:51:27.480 --> 1:51:28.480]  This is modern warfare, folks.
[1:51:28.480 --> 1:51:29.480]  You're in it.
[1:51:29.480 --> 1:51:30.480]  That's why I'm so excited and so crazy.
[1:51:30.480 --> 1:51:33.280]  I mean, this is just over the top dangerous.
[1:51:33.280 --> 1:51:34.280]  People need to understand that.
[1:51:34.280 --> 1:51:35.280]  Stay with us.
[1:51:35.280 --> 1:51:38.280]  We're called straight ahead.
[1:51:38.280 --> 1:51:47.800]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy and overall wellness.
[1:51:47.800 --> 1:51:55.560]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date super male vitality specifically
[1:51:55.560 --> 1:52:02.600]  designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality
[1:52:02.600 --> 1:52:03.600]  in males.
[1:52:03.600 --> 1:52:09.560]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains
[1:52:09.560 --> 1:52:14.400]  no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[1:52:14.400 --> 1:52:21.800]  Yes, we're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology working together in
[1:52:21.800 --> 1:52:26.960]  perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb packed formula.
[1:52:26.960 --> 1:52:28.440]  So what are you waiting for?
[1:52:28.440 --> 1:52:30.440]  Go to the InforWars store.
[1:52:30.440 --> 1:52:39.840]  Never been a better time than right now, super male vitality at InforWarsStore.com.
[1:52:39.840 --> 1:52:42.080]  This is the end, my friends.
[1:52:42.080 --> 1:52:47.960]  My only friends, the end of our elaborate plans, the end of everything that stands,
[1:52:47.960 --> 1:52:52.600]  the end, the safety, the delusion.
[1:52:52.600 --> 1:52:58.960]  It's all over, ladies and gentlemen, because it was only the mirage of safety, movies and
[1:52:58.960 --> 1:53:04.400]  partying and living like children, never growing up, never caring about other people.
[1:53:04.400 --> 1:53:09.480]  This delivered us into the hands of tyranny, just like the history book shows, just like
[1:53:09.480 --> 1:53:11.000]  the Bible states.
[1:53:11.000 --> 1:53:15.240]  Every time Israel became corrupt and evil and turned away from God, they were brought
[1:53:15.240 --> 1:53:21.000]  into captivity because their people sold out to special interests and were infiltrated
[1:53:21.000 --> 1:53:24.000]  by spies, and then they were enslaved.
[1:53:24.000 --> 1:53:29.680]  We are repeating that again today, compliance and going along with this system leads to
[1:53:29.680 --> 1:53:31.960]  absolute bondage.
[1:53:31.960 --> 1:53:36.240]  InforWars has decided to fight for freedom, and InforWars has had great victory thanks
[1:53:36.240 --> 1:53:41.520]  to your support and your prayers.
[1:53:41.520 --> 1:53:47.840]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:53:47.840 --> 1:53:53.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[1:53:53.000 --> 1:54:00.800]  So, Dr. Faustus Fauci has come out and told us what we already know.
[1:54:00.800 --> 1:54:08.040]  The mask is a sign of submission, like Islam, a sign of slavery, a sign of respect to the
[1:54:08.040 --> 1:54:14.720]  fraud of the NIH and the National Health Services in Europe and the UK.
[1:54:14.720 --> 1:54:19.920]  There's a video on InforWars.com, it's a long video, of them doing TikTok videos on
[1:54:19.920 --> 1:54:23.440]  people die in the emergency room waiting area.
[1:54:23.440 --> 1:54:30.560]  Everyone's clapping, it's so Marie Antoinette-esque, let them eat cake, but here's Dr. Fausti.
[1:54:30.560 --> 1:54:31.560]  Here he is.
[1:54:31.560 --> 1:54:35.400]  I wear it for the reason that I believe it is effective.
[1:54:35.400 --> 1:54:40.960]  It's not 100% effective, I mean it's sort of respect for another person and have that
[1:54:40.960 --> 1:54:42.800]  other person respect you.
[1:54:42.800 --> 1:54:47.640]  You wear a mask, they wear a mask, you protect each other.
[1:54:47.640 --> 1:54:54.560]  You wear a mask, they wear a mask, you protect each other.
[1:54:54.560 --> 1:54:57.240]  Protect the UN condoms, don't have children either.
[1:54:57.240 --> 1:55:03.520]  Don't shake hands anymore, that's a bad, all studies show that makes you sick to not
[1:55:03.520 --> 1:55:05.720]  shake hands.
[1:55:05.720 --> 1:55:09.000]  When doctors come out and expose the real science, he has the man off YouTube because
[1:55:09.000 --> 1:55:15.040]  Fausti gave us HIV, Fausti works for Billimau and the Gates, Fausti, let's hear from Fausti
[1:55:15.040 --> 1:55:18.840]  again, start the clip over please.
[1:55:18.840 --> 1:55:24.880]  I wear it for the reason that I believe it is effective, it's not 100% effective, I mean
[1:55:24.880 --> 1:55:29.480]  it's sort of respect for another person and have that other person respect you.
[1:55:29.480 --> 1:55:32.440]  You wear a mask, they wear a mask, you protect each other.
[1:55:32.440 --> 1:55:38.560]  Be respectful and do what I say, millions are gonna die, okay it's not true, okay we're
[1:55:38.560 --> 1:55:43.360]  killing old people, I recommended, we put them all in there with COVID patients and
[1:55:43.360 --> 1:55:48.840]  kill them, it's okay though, you're doing well, I'm your daddy now, okay?
[1:55:48.840 --> 1:55:54.700]  No Fausti, you should be up on charges of capital premeditated murder, you little snot
[1:55:54.700 --> 1:55:59.040]  nose rat, then you're not gonna get away with any of the crap you're pulling, you little
[1:55:59.040 --> 1:56:03.200]  monster, let's finish up with this punk.
[1:56:03.200 --> 1:56:09.520]  And have that other person respect you, you wear a mask, they wear a mask, you send somebody
[1:56:09.520 --> 1:56:14.040]  with COVID to the nursing home, that's where it mainly kills me, get higher numbers and
[1:56:14.040 --> 1:56:19.400]  we make money, I respect the old people when I send the COVID patient in there, even though
[1:56:19.400 --> 1:56:27.160]  the doctors say don't do it, forget the doctors, I control NIH, I am Fausti, I am Fausti, you
[1:56:27.160 --> 1:56:32.600]  do what I say, oh, finish up.
[1:56:32.600 --> 1:56:37.000]  Each other, I mean I do it when I'm in the public for the reasons that A, I want to protect
[1:56:37.000 --> 1:56:41.760]  myself and protect others and also because I want to make it be a symbol for people to
[1:56:41.760 --> 1:56:45.760]  see that that's the kind of thing you should be doing and when I walk around the street
[1:56:45.760 --> 1:56:50.480]  in the neighborhood where I live in Washington DC, which still has a considerable number
[1:56:50.480 --> 1:56:51.480]  of infections.
[1:56:51.480 --> 1:56:52.480]  Oh yes, very dangerous.
[1:56:52.480 --> 1:57:00.640]  But many people are doing that, it's still very scary, sounds like a Lonnie Turner's character,
[1:57:00.640 --> 1:57:03.480]  he's deadly dangerous.
[1:57:03.480 --> 1:57:08.720]  You want to protect yourself, like listen, we're going to protect the old people, we
[1:57:08.720 --> 1:57:14.360]  got something that mainly only kills old people, respiratory, let's put the patients in there
[1:57:14.360 --> 1:57:19.400]  with the healthy ones, but all family can't come see them, you might have it, but if you
[1:57:19.400 --> 1:57:24.520]  have it, we're going to put you in there and then we're going to make a lot of money out
[1:57:24.520 --> 1:57:29.760]  of it and once we corrupt all the hospitals that went along with it, we control them now.
[1:57:29.760 --> 1:57:37.760]  I am Fausti, I am your boss, I am your master and now the lockdown never ends and I have
[1:57:37.760 --> 1:57:39.640]  shots for you.
[1:57:39.640 --> 1:57:42.640]  I am Fausti.
[1:57:42.640 --> 1:57:47.160]  We got a guest join us for a couple of segments to put out this amazing, I like that original
[1:57:47.160 --> 1:57:54.640]  song, who put that out, I wear my son glasses at night, what's that man?
[1:57:54.640 --> 1:58:00.600]  Put it on screen, you guys, you guys always have your mic started up, so it's unintelligible.
[1:58:00.600 --> 1:58:05.080]  Corey Hart, that's originally put out the music?
[1:58:05.080 --> 1:58:06.080]  Okay.
[1:58:06.080 --> 1:58:16.880]  Well, we'll see what happens here coming up, folks, we'll see what happens today.
[1:58:16.880 --> 1:58:20.200]  We're going to try our best on the other side, we're going to come in with the music video,
[1:58:20.200 --> 1:58:25.040]  no music before it, we're going to come in with the music video and then we're going
[1:58:25.040 --> 1:58:27.880]  to go to our guest who wears his sunglasses at night and then we can put them on screen
[1:58:27.880 --> 1:58:28.880]  for folks.
[1:58:28.880 --> 1:58:35.880]  There he is right there for you, as you can see, lightning's beating, yeah, a thought
[1:58:35.880 --> 1:58:43.840]  criminal, infowars.com, do not visit, do not spread, do what Fausti says, lie down and
[1:58:43.840 --> 1:58:46.840]  die.

[2:00:14.280 --> 2:00:28.280]  And I wear my face mask when I walk, so I can, so I can, make sure they all know I'm really
[2:00:28.280 --> 2:00:29.280]  smart.
[2:00:29.280 --> 2:00:36.280]  Keep your distance, keep your distance, keep your distance, keep your distance, keep your
[2:00:36.280 --> 2:00:40.280]  distance, keep your distance, keep your distance, while they're deceiving me, it cuts my immunity,
[2:00:40.280 --> 2:00:51.280]  TV's got control of me, I turn it on they say, don't trust the man with the orange skin
[2:00:51.280 --> 2:01:07.280]  comes from China, but there has to be some form of punishment.
[2:01:07.280 --> 2:01:12.280]  Then the final solution, which is a year or two years off, is the vaccine.
[2:01:12.280 --> 2:01:21.280]  And I wear my face mask in my house, so I can, so I can, stop a symptomatic disease,
[2:01:21.280 --> 2:01:22.280]  spread to myself.
[2:01:22.280 --> 2:01:38.280]  And I wear my face mask when I bite, so I can, so I can, placate all the carons at the
[2:01:38.280 --> 2:01:42.280]  same time.
[2:01:42.280 --> 2:01:54.280]  And now the fool is deceiving me, treat freedom for security, TV's got control of me, I turn
[2:01:54.280 --> 2:02:04.280]  it on they say, don't take it off till the vaccine's here, oh no.
[2:02:04.280 --> 2:02:09.280]  Get microchipped and go back to work, oh yeah.
[2:02:09.280 --> 2:02:19.280]  Oh no, I can't believe it, he's not just a nerd, he's like a doctor too, oh yeah.
[2:02:19.280 --> 2:02:25.280]  The contact trace is knocking at my door, oh no.
[2:02:25.280 --> 2:02:47.280]  I'm just a number.
[2:02:47.280 --> 2:02:56.280]  Well, rarely does an adaptation or a cover surpass the original, but I have to say Sunglasses
[2:02:56.280 --> 2:02:59.280]  at Night, sung by Canadian singer Corey Hart, has been eclipsed by media bear.
[2:02:59.280 --> 2:03:05.280]  Our next guest is an example of dutiful preparation met with outspoken righteousness.
[2:03:05.280 --> 2:03:10.280]  He made an instrumental video that inadvertently has become the anthem of mass people around
[2:03:10.280 --> 2:03:11.280]  the world.
[2:03:11.280 --> 2:03:17.280]  He accused him of being an immune system denier, the aptation of such a rigid application of
[2:03:17.280 --> 2:03:19.280]  PPE, personal protection equipment.
[2:03:19.280 --> 2:03:24.280]  But at the end of the day, he isn't selfish, in fact, he doesn't protect all of us in
[2:03:24.280 --> 2:03:25.280]  mankind.
[2:03:25.280 --> 2:03:32.280]  Please clap for Governor Lordship Fauci, David Rockefeller, and of course Bill Gates and
[2:03:32.280 --> 2:03:33.280]  media bear.
[2:03:33.280 --> 2:03:35.280]  I'm wrong, you're right, you're a hero.
[2:03:35.280 --> 2:03:40.280]  The kids are saying, they say for three years in LA, everyone's going to wear a mask, Europe's
[2:03:40.280 --> 2:03:42.280]  no more lunches, no more playgrounds.
[2:03:42.280 --> 2:03:43.280]  We're all prisoners.
[2:03:43.280 --> 2:03:44.280]  You're heroes.
[2:03:44.280 --> 2:03:46.280]  Doesn't matter all the numbers are fraud.
[2:03:46.280 --> 2:03:49.280]  Here's to you, media bear.
[2:03:49.280 --> 2:03:57.280]  No, I'm just doing my part to spread how important it is that we stop the spread of this disease
[2:03:57.280 --> 2:04:02.280]  that we may not know that we have, because we may give it to somebody who may never know
[2:04:02.280 --> 2:04:03.280]  that they caught it.
[2:04:03.280 --> 2:04:06.280]  Well, yeah, most are asymptomatic and they're counting all the regular deaths from everything
[2:04:06.280 --> 2:04:08.280]  else is this, but I mean, you're such a hero.
[2:04:08.280 --> 2:04:10.280]  Why do you wear that?
[2:04:10.280 --> 2:04:13.280]  I mean, who knew that we suddenly men would wear burgers as well?
[2:04:13.280 --> 2:04:14.280]  Well, it's true.
[2:04:14.280 --> 2:04:20.280]  You know, it's important that I'm not sure why you're not wearing your mask right now,
[2:04:20.280 --> 2:04:21.280]  Alex.
[2:04:21.280 --> 2:04:25.280]  This disease has been proven to spread through photons now through the screen.
[2:04:25.280 --> 2:04:29.280]  So I would appreciate you to mask up for me.
[2:04:29.280 --> 2:04:32.280]  Okay, I tell you what, next segment, I will go get my mask on.
[2:04:32.280 --> 2:04:33.280]  Okay.
[2:04:33.280 --> 2:04:37.280]  Will you virtually signal and tell me I'm a hero if I do it?
[2:04:37.280 --> 2:04:39.280]  Of course I will, Alex.
[2:04:39.280 --> 2:04:42.280]  You'll be protecting all of us at that point.
[2:04:42.280 --> 2:04:46.280]  Did you hear what Fauci had to say earlier, how he does it to teach us to be good and
[2:04:46.280 --> 2:04:47.280]  be respectful?
[2:04:47.280 --> 2:04:53.280]  Yeah, you know, the whole thing is actually completely ridiculous and was made from after
[2:04:53.280 --> 2:05:00.280]  days and days of arguing with people on our neighborhood website, ultimately.
[2:05:00.280 --> 2:05:02.280]  Yeah, let's get serious for a moment.
[2:05:02.280 --> 2:05:07.280]  Tell us who you want to get in the thought crown and make us into prison in Europe, actually
[2:05:07.280 --> 2:05:08.280]  arrest you if you question it right now.
[2:05:08.280 --> 2:05:10.280]  But I mean, what made you make this great video?
[2:05:10.280 --> 2:05:11.280]  Had you done this before?
[2:05:11.280 --> 2:05:14.280]  What made you stand up against this wonderful freedom?
[2:05:14.280 --> 2:05:24.280]  Well, yeah, so I mean, I guess I've been arguing with people about this mask situation and,
[2:05:24.280 --> 2:05:31.280]  you know, on our neighborhood website, this thing was ultimately made to kind of have
[2:05:31.280 --> 2:05:38.280]  fun with me and a few of my friends and my wife and whatnot and play on our neighborhood
[2:05:38.280 --> 2:05:40.280]  website to mess with some of these people.
[2:05:40.280 --> 2:05:46.280]  And when I posted it, my channel had 45 subscribers.
[2:05:46.280 --> 2:05:48.280]  And the rest is kind of history.
[2:05:48.280 --> 2:05:50.280]  Yeah, tell us what's happened now.
[2:05:50.280 --> 2:05:52.280]  People are hungry for art and for truth.
[2:05:52.280 --> 2:05:53.280]  Yeah, it's awesome.
[2:05:53.280 --> 2:06:00.280]  I mean, I've gotten so many people that have been really enjoying it and showing it.
[2:06:00.280 --> 2:06:02.280]  Everyone that they can.
[2:06:02.280 --> 2:06:09.280]  And it's actually a pretty humbling experience to see how this thing is.
[2:06:09.280 --> 2:06:10.280]  So many people have enjoyed it.
[2:06:10.280 --> 2:06:11.280]  It's really awesome, actually.
[2:06:11.280 --> 2:06:13.280]  What about censorship?
[2:06:13.280 --> 2:06:17.280]  All these medical doctors, scientists, you know, former head of the Rockefeller hospital
[2:06:17.280 --> 2:06:21.280]  in public, they banned him saying it's all basically an overdriven hoax.
[2:06:21.280 --> 2:06:23.280]  Because I mean, you're saying it's real.
[2:06:23.280 --> 2:06:25.280]  We should all just worship those that wear masks.
[2:06:25.280 --> 2:06:26.280]  Have you had problems?
[2:06:26.280 --> 2:06:30.280]  I've seen, you know, tens of millions of views of your video.
[2:06:30.280 --> 2:06:36.280]  Have you experienced the love of the big tech protecting us?
[2:06:36.280 --> 2:06:43.280]  You know, I don't really know enough about a lot of that stuff to really have much of
[2:06:43.280 --> 2:06:45.280]  an opinion on it.
[2:06:45.280 --> 2:06:50.280]  I know that the video, you know, it probably feels to me like it's been viewed more times
[2:06:50.280 --> 2:06:51.280]  than it actually has.
[2:06:51.280 --> 2:06:56.280]  But I mean, there's, you know, hundreds of mirrors, lots of people sharing it probably
[2:06:56.280 --> 2:06:59.280]  in places that aren't racking up views and stuff like that.
[2:06:59.280 --> 2:07:01.280]  So where did you pick this song?
[2:07:01.280 --> 2:07:03.280]  Because it's just, it's genius.
[2:07:03.280 --> 2:07:06.280]  I mean, are you in marketing already or how'd you think of this?
[2:07:06.280 --> 2:07:08.280]  So I'm glad that you asked.
[2:07:08.280 --> 2:07:15.280]  We, I mean, I've made several different little spoof parody, you know, absurd edits and stuff
[2:07:15.280 --> 2:07:19.280]  like that on my channel in the past.
[2:07:19.280 --> 2:07:23.280]  And so after arguing with all of these mask people.
[2:07:23.280 --> 2:07:24.280]  Hold on.
[2:07:24.280 --> 2:07:25.280]  You got a whole, you were breaking up.
[2:07:25.280 --> 2:07:28.280]  You were sending some COVID at me just now.
[2:07:28.280 --> 2:07:29.280]  It caused a break.
[2:07:29.280 --> 2:07:30.280]  Oh, how?
[2:07:30.280 --> 2:07:31.280]  Yeah.
[2:07:31.280 --> 2:07:32.280]  Yeah.
[2:07:32.280 --> 2:07:33.280]  You just hit me with some COVID.
[2:07:33.280 --> 2:07:34.280]  Sorry.
[2:07:34.280 --> 2:07:35.280]  Cause you're right.
[2:07:35.280 --> 2:07:36.280]  They don't say it comes through the TV screen.
[2:07:36.280 --> 2:07:37.280]  Sorry.
[2:07:37.280 --> 2:07:38.280]  Go ahead.
[2:07:38.280 --> 2:07:39.280]  Yeah.
[2:07:39.280 --> 2:07:40.280]  No, it's, it's fine.
[2:07:40.280 --> 2:07:41.280]  I apologize.
[2:07:41.280 --> 2:07:42.280]  This is a new mask though.
[2:07:42.280 --> 2:07:45.280]  So, um, so yeah, my, my wife actually, we were going through and trying to figure out what
[2:07:45.280 --> 2:07:47.280]  song would be really good to use.
[2:07:47.280 --> 2:07:51.280]  We were about to do, she blinded me with science for Dr. Berks.
[2:07:51.280 --> 2:07:56.280]  And, uh, but we decided ultimately when we were scrolling through and looking at different
[2:07:56.280 --> 2:08:05.280]  options, she saw sunglasses at night and she said, I wear my face mask in my car.
[2:08:05.280 --> 2:08:07.280]  And the rest is history.
[2:08:07.280 --> 2:08:12.280]  So your, your, your wonderful wife was the inspiration for this.
[2:08:12.280 --> 2:08:18.280]  100% of the, the, the choice of what song we chose, it was, it all was absolutely 100%
[2:08:18.280 --> 2:08:19.280]  meant to be.
[2:08:19.280 --> 2:08:23.280]  We sat down and wrote the lyrics and about five or six minutes.
[2:08:23.280 --> 2:08:25.280]  My best friend did the singing for it.
[2:08:25.280 --> 2:08:29.280]  And, uh, that's, it's, uh, yeah.
[2:08:29.280 --> 2:08:31.280]  You have done well Lord Vita.
[2:08:31.280 --> 2:08:32.280]  Yeah.
[2:08:32.280 --> 2:08:34.280]  We're going to give you the Emperor Palpatine silver approval.
[2:08:34.280 --> 2:08:38.280]  That's a very rare tongue of Michelin star for your restaurant.
[2:08:38.280 --> 2:08:40.280]  That's like the Emperor Palpatine silver approval.
[2:08:40.280 --> 2:08:45.280]  I have not yet received that, but someday I'll make something as good as you've done.
[2:08:45.280 --> 2:08:46.280]  It's perfect.
[2:08:46.280 --> 2:08:48.280]  I can't thank you enough, Alex.
[2:08:48.280 --> 2:08:50.280]  I'm really glad that you liked it.
[2:08:50.280 --> 2:08:52.280]  I hope that your audience likes it.
[2:08:52.280 --> 2:08:57.280]  Um, we were actually working on something, uh, in the same vein right now.
[2:08:57.280 --> 2:09:00.280]  So, uh, I'm told, I think they told me you have something else you made.
[2:09:00.280 --> 2:09:02.280]  I haven't seen it yet.
[2:09:02.280 --> 2:09:05.280]  There's been a one or two that, that we've released since then.
[2:09:05.280 --> 2:09:10.280]  Nothing that's, um, that's terribly, uh, you know, the same level of, um, production
[2:09:10.280 --> 2:09:14.280]  and stuff, but we are working on something now that will be, uh, kind of a,
[2:09:14.280 --> 2:09:19.280]  a quality follow up to, uh, to the face mask in the car song.
[2:09:19.280 --> 2:09:23.280]  Now that we're on the Star Wars angle, can Darth Vader remove his mask?
[2:09:23.280 --> 2:09:25.280]  That's just too dangerous when we come back because you could,
[2:09:25.280 --> 2:09:28.280]  you can affect everybody watching if you took your mask off, right?
[2:09:28.280 --> 2:09:31.280]  It's dangerous out here and in here.
[2:09:31.280 --> 2:09:33.280]  That's the disease is literally everywhere.
[2:09:33.280 --> 2:09:36.280]  I mean, uh, the common cold is respect.
[2:09:36.280 --> 2:09:39.280]  Like Fauci said, you're going to leave it on.
[2:09:39.280 --> 2:09:42.280]  They're making arrest in England of husbands that kiss their wives.
[2:09:42.280 --> 2:09:44.280]  So please keep the mask on, please, please.
[2:09:44.280 --> 2:09:49.280]  I've hunted a lot of big game at long distances with high caliber rifles.
[2:09:49.280 --> 2:09:54.280]  And when you shoot an L could say 600 yards, even if you hit them right in the heart,
[2:09:54.280 --> 2:09:59.280]  they'll still run 50, 60, 70, maybe a hundred yards.
[2:09:59.280 --> 2:10:04.280]  They've got that adrenaline pumping through their arteries and through their veins.
[2:10:04.280 --> 2:10:07.280]  But all of a sudden they slow down, they realize what's happened.
[2:10:07.280 --> 2:10:10.280]  They fall over and they die.
[2:10:10.280 --> 2:10:13.280]  Then you go back and haul them back in.
[2:10:13.280 --> 2:10:16.280]  Well, that's what's going to happen to the entire world now.
[2:10:16.280 --> 2:10:22.280]  And that's what the economic numbers show is that we've been shot right in the heart.
[2:10:22.280 --> 2:10:27.280]  And for the first world, it's going to mean a long, horrible depression and a lot of death.
[2:10:27.280 --> 2:10:30.280]  Well, for the third world, it's going to mean probably over a hundred million dead,
[2:10:30.280 --> 2:10:32.280]  according to the UN and I believe their numbers.
[2:10:32.280 --> 2:10:37.280]  Because it's the very UN that's orchestrated this to depopulate the third world.
[2:10:37.280 --> 2:10:40.280]  So to all the leftists that thought it was their revolution to get rid of Trump,
[2:10:40.280 --> 2:11:09.280]  you're a bunch of suckers and you bought into something better than what Hitler did.
[2:11:11.280 --> 2:11:16.280]  I took two of them, fell asleep about 1 a.m., woke up at 8 a.m., ready to go.
[2:11:16.280 --> 2:11:20.280]  It really has made a difference in my life and it can make a difference in your life too.
[2:11:20.280 --> 2:11:22.280]  If you don't get any sleep, you're going to be a grouch.
[2:11:22.280 --> 2:11:24.280]  If you get great sleep, you're going to be on point.
[2:11:24.280 --> 2:11:25.280]  You're going to be mentally focused.
[2:11:25.280 --> 2:11:27.280]  You're going to be ready to take on the day.

[2:12:15.280 --> 2:12:16.280]  Wear a piece of paper.
[2:12:16.280 --> 2:12:17.280]  It's about the respect.
[2:12:17.280 --> 2:12:24.280]  It's about the submission, not the Islam, but Faucian, Bill Gatesian.
[2:12:24.280 --> 2:12:29.280]  So I'm wearing the Alex Jones mask, the Alex Jones Halloween mask.
[2:12:29.280 --> 2:12:30.280]  Does it matter?
[2:12:30.280 --> 2:12:31.280]  Just show respect.
[2:12:31.280 --> 2:12:34.280]  I'm doing it right now.
[2:12:34.280 --> 2:12:36.280]  Another mask coming up next segment.
[2:12:36.280 --> 2:12:38.280]  But getting serious, I was just watching the White House,
[2:12:38.280 --> 2:12:41.280]  Spokeswoman destroying them on Twitter,
[2:12:41.280 --> 2:12:43.280]  fact-checking the president on Newsome,
[2:12:43.280 --> 2:12:46.280]  going to send 38 million Californians a ballot,
[2:12:46.280 --> 2:12:47.280]  even if they're not registered,
[2:12:47.280 --> 2:12:49.280]  knowing it's all fraudulent, they're going to accept them.
[2:12:49.280 --> 2:12:54.280]  I mean, that's total fraud on its face, media bear.
[2:12:54.280 --> 2:12:57.280]  And now, quote, they're fact-checking the president.
[2:12:57.280 --> 2:12:59.280]  He's got his executive order.
[2:12:59.280 --> 2:13:00.280]  Is it too little, too late?
[2:13:00.280 --> 2:13:03.280]  What do you think about the situation getting serious?
[2:13:03.280 --> 2:13:08.280]  Well, I'm just standing by to see the next heavily censored tweet
[2:13:08.280 --> 2:13:13.280]  from Donald Trump that'll let us know where this whole situation is heading.
[2:13:13.280 --> 2:13:15.280]  What do you think of Hollywood and the left going,
[2:13:15.280 --> 2:13:17.280]  yeah, banning, get rid of everybody's speech?
[2:13:17.280 --> 2:13:21.280]  I mean, they've totally converted it like what we always heard Phil Castro was like.
[2:13:21.280 --> 2:13:23.280]  But we're like, oh, Castro doesn't really censor.
[2:13:23.280 --> 2:13:27.280]  They're like, yeah, we're like Mao Zedong censor everybody.
[2:13:27.280 --> 2:13:28.280]  Yeah.
[2:13:28.280 --> 2:13:31.280]  Well, I'm actually well-versed.
[2:13:31.280 --> 2:13:40.280]  I'm a Hollywood, I'm a crew member of the illustrious Ayatsi Filmmaking Union
[2:13:40.280 --> 2:13:44.280]  here in Georgia, so I know it well.
[2:13:44.280 --> 2:13:47.280]  Where do you think it's all going?
[2:13:47.280 --> 2:13:51.280]  I think it's all going to, for them to basically just capitulate
[2:13:51.280 --> 2:13:56.280]  to China completely, sell every single movie studio and TV station,
[2:13:56.280 --> 2:14:02.280]  and basically just hand over the rest of our culture to China.
[2:14:02.280 --> 2:14:03.280]  I totally agree.
[2:14:03.280 --> 2:14:06.280]  Here is the spokesperson, I think she did a great job with the president
[2:14:06.280 --> 2:14:07.280]  because she knows how they're going to attack.
[2:14:07.280 --> 2:14:11.280]  She does her pre-research, McKinney, breaking it down.
[2:14:11.280 --> 2:14:12.280]  Here it is.
[2:14:12.280 --> 2:14:16.280]  They're an egregious one that our U.S. military was responsible
[2:14:16.280 --> 2:14:19.280]  for the spread of the coronavirus.
[2:14:19.280 --> 2:14:23.280]  And that tweet, that disinformation, it took all the way until today
[2:14:23.280 --> 2:14:26.280]  and we raised concerns about it to get a fact check.
[2:14:26.280 --> 2:14:31.280]  So they appear to be very hastily eager to censor President Trump
[2:14:31.280 --> 2:14:35.280]  and some of his employees, but a little reluctant when it comes to China.
[2:14:35.280 --> 2:14:37.280]  It's a bit befuddling.
[2:14:37.280 --> 2:14:40.280]  But no one believes in the First Amendment more than the president.
[2:14:40.280 --> 2:14:44.280]  The president will take action to ensure that Big Tech does not stifle free speech
[2:14:44.280 --> 2:14:49.280]  and that the rights of all Americans to speak tweet and post are protected.
[2:14:49.280 --> 2:14:53.280]  And finally, I just want to note one other action of Twitter that I learned
[2:14:53.280 --> 2:14:56.280]  just before walking out here, that on the molar report,
[2:14:56.280 --> 2:15:02.280]  their anti-Trump headlines were anti-Trump by a ratio of 76 to 1.
[2:15:02.280 --> 2:15:06.280]  That's extraordinary and it's not just bias aimed at President Trump
[2:15:06.280 --> 2:15:09.280]  and his employees, it's also aimed at everyday Americans.
[2:15:09.280 --> 2:15:14.280]  It's aimed at the movie unplanned as Twitter suspended their account
[2:15:14.280 --> 2:15:17.280]  and then came up with an excuse in the aftermath.
[2:15:17.280 --> 2:15:21.280]  Just another example, that liberals are allowed to incite violence
[2:15:21.280 --> 2:15:25.280]  against the Covington kids who were in the end proven right
[2:15:25.280 --> 2:15:27.280]  and their video was taken out of context.
[2:15:27.280 --> 2:15:31.280]  And yet these individuals were led, were allowed by Twitter to incite violence.
[2:15:31.280 --> 2:15:33.280]  It's very disturbing to see.
[2:15:33.280 --> 2:15:38.280]  So those are some of the president's concerns and with that I will take questions.
[2:15:38.280 --> 2:15:39.280]  Jim.
[2:15:39.280 --> 2:15:41.280]  It's a very nice time, Jim, by the way.
[2:15:41.280 --> 2:15:42.280]  Thank you very much.
[2:15:42.280 --> 2:15:47.280]  Yesterday, the U.S. hit 100,000 deaths from the coronavirus.
[2:15:47.280 --> 2:15:50.280]  That happened at around 6 o'clock yesterday evening.
[2:15:50.280 --> 2:15:54.280]  It took until about 9 in the morning for the president to recognize that on Twitter.
[2:15:54.280 --> 2:15:56.280]  Let me hit pause on this.
[2:15:56.280 --> 2:16:01.280]  The attack is half those died nursing homes in four states,
[2:16:01.280 --> 2:16:05.280]  the Democrat ship COVID patients in on the one group it'll kill.
[2:16:05.280 --> 2:16:08.280]  And they count shark attacks and gunshot wounds.
[2:16:08.280 --> 2:16:09.280]  Just annihilate them.
[2:16:09.280 --> 2:16:11.280]  Stop buying into the whole thing.
[2:16:11.280 --> 2:16:13.280]  Destroy them with the truth.
[2:16:13.280 --> 2:16:18.280]  These reporters like yesterday it had 100,000.
[2:16:18.280 --> 2:16:21.280]  Took the president till the morning to respond.
[2:16:21.280 --> 2:16:22.280]  It's his fault.
[2:16:22.280 --> 2:16:27.280]  I mean, just listen, all they want is to plunge the economy and create hysteria.
[2:16:27.280 --> 2:16:29.280]  Here it is.
[2:16:29.280 --> 2:16:33.280]  After all, it was the impetus behind him lowering the flag to half staff.
[2:16:33.280 --> 2:16:35.280]  He did that for several days.
[2:16:35.280 --> 2:16:37.280]  I mean, and that was an acknowledgement of that number.
[2:16:37.280 --> 2:16:44.280]  He acknowledged it in a tweet this morning, but we hit 100,000 yesterday evening and it took 13 hours.
[2:16:44.280 --> 2:16:48.280]  Some odd hours to recognize that and tweet about it.
[2:16:48.280 --> 2:16:49.280]  And pause again.
[2:16:49.280 --> 2:16:50.280]  I'm Jenna Costa.
[2:16:50.280 --> 2:16:51.280]  I'm being her.
[2:16:51.280 --> 2:16:55.280]  I'm a little dead.
[2:16:55.280 --> 2:17:02.280]  Don't you think sunglasses at night media bear that we should go on the offense about this?
[2:17:02.280 --> 2:17:05.280]  I mean, this is I've got the numbers right here.
[2:17:05.280 --> 2:17:09.280]  30 to one on average was the estimates of the death.
[2:17:09.280 --> 2:17:11.280]  Then the death ratio is at 3.2%.
[2:17:11.280 --> 2:17:14.280]  Now we know it's, you know, 0.03.
[2:17:14.280 --> 2:17:18.280]  I mean, this damn thing is a big hoax.
[2:17:18.280 --> 2:17:20.280]  Yeah, it's pretty absurd.
[2:17:20.280 --> 2:17:26.280]  The last number I saw was 30 deaths per 100,000 here in the US.
[2:17:26.280 --> 2:17:27.280]  Yeah.
[2:17:27.280 --> 2:17:29.280]  So what's the, how do you, what is that?
[2:17:29.280 --> 2:17:30.280]  It's like the 0.
[2:17:30.280 --> 2:17:33.280]  0.004.
[2:17:33.280 --> 2:17:36.280]  So it's even, okay, so I'm overestimating.
[2:17:36.280 --> 2:17:37.280]  Yeah.
[2:17:37.280 --> 2:17:38.280]  Yeah.
[2:17:38.280 --> 2:17:39.280]  Wow.
[2:17:39.280 --> 2:17:42.280]  I mean, wow, you got a better chance to get struck by lightning.
[2:17:42.280 --> 2:17:47.280]  It's legitimately true that you have a better chance of getting struck by lightning.
[2:17:47.280 --> 2:17:50.280]  That's from the CDC.
[2:17:50.280 --> 2:17:57.280]  Well, they're in the news saying gunshot wounds, car wrecks, mountain climbing accidents.
[2:17:57.280 --> 2:17:59.280]  Everything is COVID.
[2:17:59.280 --> 2:18:02.280]  Good luck finding blue statistics for this year.
[2:18:02.280 --> 2:18:04.280]  Well, they admit there's no flu deaths.
[2:18:04.280 --> 2:18:06.280]  It's all been moved over to this column.
[2:18:06.280 --> 2:18:10.280]  So again, shouldn't the president just go on the offense about this and expose?
[2:18:10.280 --> 2:18:17.280]  But again, you're like, well, he sure, but Fauci was waiting like a time bomb loaded in there.
[2:18:17.280 --> 2:18:19.280]  Yeah, it's, it's absurd.
[2:18:19.280 --> 2:18:26.280]  How, um, I mean, Fauci has already confirmed that hydroxychloroquine works on SARS and
[2:18:26.280 --> 2:18:29.280]  now they're pretending that they need to go through all these tests again and stuff.
[2:18:29.280 --> 2:18:36.280]  And it's purely a drama and an opera for a bunch of masked people and idiots in the country.
[2:18:36.280 --> 2:18:39.280]  Well, that's because he's invested in resvesivir resvesivir.
[2:18:39.280 --> 2:18:40.280]  How are you saying?
[2:18:40.280 --> 2:18:42.280]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[2:18:42.280 --> 2:18:43.280]  Yeah.
[2:18:43.280 --> 2:18:47.280]  What do you make of Gates's vaccines in humans and animals getting banned because they're
[2:18:47.280 --> 2:18:50.280]  killing so many animals?
[2:18:50.280 --> 2:18:58.280]  Well, let's just say that we're working on something for Bill Gates, something absurd
[2:18:58.280 --> 2:19:05.280]  that will perfectly ridicule his, um, attempts at vaccinating the entire world.
[2:19:05.280 --> 2:19:12.280]  I wear my Nazi arm band at night so I can, so I can.
[2:19:12.280 --> 2:19:14.280]  I like that.
[2:19:14.280 --> 2:19:16.280]  Something like that.
[2:19:16.280 --> 2:19:19.280]  It'll be a completely different tune though.
[2:19:19.280 --> 2:19:24.280]  Look at those teeth.
[2:19:24.280 --> 2:19:28.280]  Nothing more dangerous than a psychotic nerd.
[2:19:28.280 --> 2:19:32.280]  Yeah, I can't get enough to see him get hit in the face with a pie.
[2:19:32.280 --> 2:19:34.280]  I'm just glad it wasn't a baseball bat with nails.
[2:19:34.280 --> 2:19:36.280]  God, that'd have been terrible.
[2:19:36.280 --> 2:19:37.280]  Yeah, me too.
[2:19:37.280 --> 2:19:38.280]  That's true.
[2:19:38.280 --> 2:19:41.280]  Like big old, like six inch long nails, like just wham right in the sun.
[2:19:41.280 --> 2:19:42.280]  But you know what?
[2:19:42.280 --> 2:19:44.280]  Seriously, the last thing I want is anything to bad happen to him.
[2:19:44.280 --> 2:19:48.280]  I want him to live a long good life in a pain induction chamber.
[2:19:48.280 --> 2:19:49.280]  Absolutely.
[2:19:49.280 --> 2:19:50.280]  That looks delicious.
[2:19:50.280 --> 2:19:51.280]  Look at that.
[2:19:51.280 --> 2:19:53.280]  That looks absolutely delicious.
[2:19:53.280 --> 2:19:55.280]  Well, maybe he'll commit suicide to make room for the rest of us.
[2:19:55.280 --> 2:19:57.280]  You know, he says killing old people gets jobs.
[2:19:57.280 --> 2:20:01.280]  Well, he's kind of old now or his dad's 95 in that nursing home.
[2:20:01.280 --> 2:20:03.280]  I mean, you know, I don't wish any harm against Bill Gates,
[2:20:03.280 --> 2:20:06.280]  senior head of Planned Parenthood, you Genesis Nazi.
[2:20:06.280 --> 2:20:10.280]  I'm just saying, like, hey, you know, save the earth bill.
[2:20:10.280 --> 2:20:12.280]  How about we put some COVID pages with your dad?
[2:20:12.280 --> 2:20:13.280]  Huh?
[2:20:13.280 --> 2:20:18.280]  Well, and that's the policy, right?
[2:20:18.280 --> 2:20:23.280]  Yes, that's the excellent point.
[2:20:23.280 --> 2:20:25.280]  Media bear, we got you surrounded.
[2:20:25.280 --> 2:20:30.280]  Approach your door with your hands visible, your gloves on, and your mask tight.
[2:20:30.280 --> 2:20:37.280]  You've been reported for having contact with somebody that's been infected with an asymptomatic disease.
[2:20:37.280 --> 2:20:38.280]  Hold on.
[2:20:38.280 --> 2:20:39.280]  What's going on there at your house?
[2:20:39.280 --> 2:20:40.280]  I can't.
[2:20:40.280 --> 2:20:43.280]  We're going to stick a needle in your arm and vaccinate you.
[2:20:43.280 --> 2:20:48.280]  When it comes to regaining energy during the day, convenience is key.
[2:20:48.280 --> 2:20:53.280]  Sure, coffee, candy, and other highly sugar-filled drinks can give you a short boost,
[2:20:53.280 --> 2:20:56.280]  but the crash always follows.
[2:20:56.280 --> 2:21:02.280]  That's why we created a mixable energy formula to take on the go when you need a little help.
[2:21:02.280 --> 2:21:03.280]  Turboforce.
[2:21:03.280 --> 2:21:06.280]  Similar to other mix-in energy packets,
[2:21:06.280 --> 2:21:14.280]  Turboforce from InfoWarsLife utilizes vitamins, amino acids, and extracts used for hundreds of years
[2:21:14.280 --> 2:21:20.280]  across the world to provide focus, clarity, and a boost of energy when you need it.
[2:21:20.280 --> 2:21:27.280]  Turboforce is certainly a force to be reckoned with for portable, affordable, and tasty energy.
[2:21:27.280 --> 2:21:34.280]  And speaking of affordable, you can even try Turboforce for a limited time at an incredible 40% off.
[2:21:34.280 --> 2:21:43.280]  Don't wait till it's out of stock again and get Turboforce right now, only at InfoWarsStore.com.
[2:22:05.280 --> 2:22:10.280]  But in the end, the globalists admit they're building a post-human world.
[2:22:10.280 --> 2:22:16.280]  And now that we're inside the cage, it's going to move very, very quickly into its endgame.
[2:22:16.280 --> 2:22:24.280]  Submission to this is a form of living death and committing the next generation and our own generation
[2:22:24.280 --> 2:22:30.280]  to a living hell that cannot be imagined until you're actually experiencing this.
[2:22:30.280 --> 2:22:35.280]  This is your dignity, your soul, your future being torn inside out.
[2:22:35.280 --> 2:22:42.280]  This is a scientific dictatorship taking full control of humanity for its own selfish, disgusting power trip.
[2:22:44.280 --> 2:22:49.280]  The United States is not communist China. We don't have 3 million people in concentration camps.
[2:22:49.280 --> 2:22:54.280]  We don't blow up churches. We don't kill political dissidents and sell their organs.
[2:22:54.280 --> 2:23:00.280]  But all over the news, we see the UN, billable indicates, WHO, mainstream corporate media,
[2:23:00.280 --> 2:23:03.280]  praising communist China for their response.
[2:23:03.280 --> 2:23:09.280]  And if communist China shoots women at checkpoints and welds people into their houses and has robots controlling people,
[2:23:09.280 --> 2:23:11.280]  well then gee, we've got to do that.
[2:23:11.280 --> 2:23:16.280]  And on top of it, cities like San Antonio pass laws saying we'll arrest you if you say Chinese virus.
[2:23:16.280 --> 2:23:20.280]  Well now Cuomo in New York is calling it the European virus.
[2:23:20.280 --> 2:23:25.280]  These people are out of control, control freaks, and they are going to lose big time
[2:23:25.280 --> 2:23:30.280]  because we the people are aware of their criminal activities and are exposing them in their power grab.
[2:23:30.280 --> 2:23:34.280]  The Resistance lives at band.video and infowars.com.
[2:23:34.280 --> 2:23:37.280]  Spread those links and jam it down the censor's throats
[2:23:37.280 --> 2:23:51.280]  and then we'll be able to defeat their operation that much quicker.
[2:24:07.280 --> 2:24:22.280]  So, facts don't matter.
[2:24:22.280 --> 2:24:25.280]  Reality doesn't matter.
[2:24:25.280 --> 2:24:28.280]  What matters is I'm wearing this mask.
[2:24:28.280 --> 2:24:32.280]  That means that I am morally superior to everyone.
[2:24:32.280 --> 2:24:35.280]  I have submitted to Fauci and Bill Gates in the UN.
[2:24:35.280 --> 2:24:37.280]  I am here on air.
[2:24:37.280 --> 2:24:39.280]  I am supreme.
[2:24:39.280 --> 2:24:40.280]  I am moral.
[2:24:40.280 --> 2:24:42.280]  Never shake hands again.
[2:24:42.280 --> 2:24:44.280]  Never kiss again.
[2:24:44.280 --> 2:24:46.280]  Everyone must be raised in test tubes.
[2:24:46.280 --> 2:24:49.280]  All babies must be born in test tubes.
[2:24:49.280 --> 2:24:52.280]  This is the promise of the New World Order.
[2:24:52.280 --> 2:25:01.280]  We have a hero on with us right now who only wears his face mask at night everywhere he goes.
[2:25:01.280 --> 2:25:07.280]  Tell us more my hero media bear about what you're doing.
[2:25:07.280 --> 2:25:16.280]  Well, in my opinion, ridicule is the best antidote for this absurdity.
[2:25:16.280 --> 2:25:22.280]  So, I'm just going to keep having fun making fun of these people
[2:25:22.280 --> 2:25:33.280]  and trying to spread more of the word of how absurd and ridiculous all of these things that they want to do to our society really is.
[2:25:33.280 --> 2:25:36.280]  Well, we've got another music video you put out, a little short one.
[2:25:36.280 --> 2:25:38.280]  But what else do you have coming out soon?
[2:25:38.280 --> 2:25:39.280]  Oh, sorry.
[2:25:39.280 --> 2:25:40.280]  I'm sorry.
[2:25:40.280 --> 2:25:41.280]  I was being rude to you.
[2:25:41.280 --> 2:25:43.280]  I want to support you.
[2:25:43.280 --> 2:25:46.280]  It doesn't matter if my mask is fake like everybody else's.
[2:25:46.280 --> 2:25:50.280]  People also wear the same gloves, which means nothing.
[2:25:50.280 --> 2:25:52.280]  Have you ever worked in medical stuff?
[2:25:52.280 --> 2:25:55.280]  You take gloves off during every procedure, but now it's just you wear a glove.
[2:25:55.280 --> 2:25:57.280]  It's another sign of how good you are, right?
[2:25:57.280 --> 2:25:58.280]  Sure.
[2:25:58.280 --> 2:26:00.280]  I know you're wearing a glove.
[2:26:00.280 --> 2:26:03.280]  I mean, I've got hundreds of thousands of these.
[2:26:03.280 --> 2:26:08.280]  So why wouldn't I just change them every few minutes and just stay safe?
[2:26:08.280 --> 2:26:10.280]  I'm just trying to do this to protect everybody else.
[2:26:10.280 --> 2:26:11.280]  Yeah, you're just.
[2:26:11.280 --> 2:26:16.280]  I don't have thoughts you said, right?
[2:26:16.280 --> 2:26:18.280]  So what's coming next here?
[2:26:18.280 --> 2:26:21.280]  Because in LA, they say the kids never go back without they all stay alone.
[2:26:21.280 --> 2:26:23.280]  There's no more touching ever.
[2:26:23.280 --> 2:26:26.280]  The left already wanted to get rid of like playing tag and sports.
[2:26:26.280 --> 2:26:28.280]  So this is just like bubble people.
[2:26:28.280 --> 2:26:30.280]  Isn't this a great new future?
[2:26:30.280 --> 2:26:32.280]  No, it actually is.
[2:26:32.280 --> 2:26:35.280]  I've completely separated from my entire family.
[2:26:35.280 --> 2:26:36.280]  I live.
[2:26:36.280 --> 2:26:41.280]  I can't spread it that way.
[2:26:41.280 --> 2:26:46.280]  You mean you can't spread the humans that way?
[2:26:46.280 --> 2:26:50.280]  Yeah.
[2:26:50.280 --> 2:26:52.280]  Oh, God, that mask is great, Alex.
[2:26:52.280 --> 2:26:54.280]  Well, I think she's safe.
[2:26:54.280 --> 2:26:57.280]  You want to tell me I'm a hero?
[2:26:57.280 --> 2:27:01.280]  Well, no, you're you're doing this to save and protect your entire crew.
[2:27:01.280 --> 2:27:07.280]  I mean, any, any amount of droplets could escape from you and potentially infect the entire.
[2:27:07.280 --> 2:27:10.280]  Exactly.
[2:27:10.280 --> 2:27:12.280]  Excelsior.
[2:27:12.280 --> 2:27:13.280]  What about vaccines?
[2:27:13.280 --> 2:27:16.280]  You need those.
[2:27:16.280 --> 2:27:20.280]  You need me to put a special shot in you, my friend.
[2:27:20.280 --> 2:27:22.280]  The vaccine isn't going to be enough.
[2:27:22.280 --> 2:27:30.280]  It's it's going to need to include in a microchip or a quantum tattoo or some sort of digital certificate.
[2:27:30.280 --> 2:27:34.280]  Oh, but it's not pretty.
[2:27:34.280 --> 2:27:35.280]  Yes.
[2:27:35.280 --> 2:27:42.280]  Well, I mean, you know, that doesn't do it is a bad person should be imprisoned.
[2:27:42.280 --> 2:27:45.280]  You know, I'm glad that you mentioned that before the last break.
[2:27:45.280 --> 2:27:50.280]  I had a contact tracer knock on my door and they saw it happen.
[2:27:50.280 --> 2:27:52.280]  I'm a hero.
[2:27:52.280 --> 2:27:57.280]  Yeah, they, um, it's I'm just busy being a hero right now.
[2:27:57.280 --> 2:28:06.280]  Oh, I'm a hero.
[2:28:06.280 --> 2:28:08.280]  I love it.
[2:28:08.280 --> 2:28:09.280]  You're doing your part, Alex.
[2:28:09.280 --> 2:28:10.280]  You really are.
[2:28:10.280 --> 2:28:12.280]  What about the contact tracer?
[2:28:12.280 --> 2:28:13.280]  I'm going to thought crown.
[2:28:13.280 --> 2:28:14.280]  Take this off real quick.
[2:28:14.280 --> 2:28:15.280]  Sorry.
[2:28:15.280 --> 2:28:16.280]  I'm exposing everyone.
[2:28:16.280 --> 2:28:17.280]  Yeah.
[2:28:17.280 --> 2:28:18.280]  Yeah.
[2:28:18.280 --> 2:28:22.280]  Emergency biological weapon release, biological weapon release, humanoid DNA.
[2:28:22.280 --> 2:28:25.280]  Well, it was a very short meeting.
[2:28:25.280 --> 2:28:26.280]  They knocked on the door.
[2:28:26.280 --> 2:28:32.280]  They said, um, you know, that I had potentially been in contact with someone who was infected
[2:28:32.280 --> 2:28:35.280]  with, you know, a disease that they didn't show any symptoms.
[2:28:35.280 --> 2:28:39.280]  And so if you were infected, though, we need to send you to nursing home right away, though.
[2:28:39.280 --> 2:28:40.280]  Right.
[2:28:40.280 --> 2:28:43.280]  Family can't visit in case you have COVID, but if you have it, we send you there.
[2:28:43.280 --> 2:28:44.280]  Sure.
[2:28:44.280 --> 2:28:48.280]  Well, they said that they would allow me to wait until I finish with you and then I'm
[2:28:48.280 --> 2:28:52.280]  going to be remanded into their care.
[2:28:52.280 --> 2:28:55.280]  You know, we joke about that, but you've seen the footage out of Europe and out of Canada
[2:28:55.280 --> 2:29:00.280]  and here where they're grabbing people that criticize COVID lockdowns.
[2:29:00.280 --> 2:29:01.280]  Yes, absolutely.
[2:29:01.280 --> 2:29:06.280]  I have a feeling that, that, um, that's, that's not why they've come for me.
[2:29:06.280 --> 2:29:07.280]  Um, I think.
[2:29:07.280 --> 2:29:10.280]  Oh yeah, this is all a cover just to be arresting and grabbing people.
[2:29:10.280 --> 2:29:11.280]  Yeah.
[2:29:11.280 --> 2:29:12.280]  Yeah.
[2:29:12.280 --> 2:29:13.280]  Yeah.
[2:29:13.280 --> 2:29:14.280]  Yeah.
[2:29:14.280 --> 2:29:15.280]  Yeah.
[2:29:15.280 --> 2:29:16.280]  Yeah.
[2:29:16.280 --> 2:29:17.280]  This is to keep everybody around me safe.
[2:29:17.280 --> 2:29:18.280]  Um, they, they just want to take me.
[2:29:18.280 --> 2:29:20.280]  They said that the microchip implant would take only moments.
[2:29:20.280 --> 2:29:21.280]  It would be painless.
[2:29:21.280 --> 2:29:25.280]  And, uh, then, then I could go back to Kroger.
[2:29:25.280 --> 2:29:27.280]  All right.
[2:29:27.280 --> 2:29:29.280]  Well, we love your song and we appreciate you.
[2:29:29.280 --> 2:29:32.280]  People can find you at media bear for now at YouTube.
[2:29:32.280 --> 2:29:35.280]  Um, where else do people find the work you're doing?
[2:29:35.280 --> 2:29:36.280]  Um, everything's there.
[2:29:36.280 --> 2:29:39.280]  Um, everything's there on my, on my YouTube channel.
[2:29:39.280 --> 2:29:42.280]  Uh, as far as the other, the other stuff that's out there that we're doing,
[2:29:42.280 --> 2:29:46.280]  we've got a couple of different things going on and they can all be found out there.
[2:29:46.280 --> 2:29:49.280]  Including this new little piece you did called hydroxy clean.
[2:29:49.280 --> 2:29:51.280]  Take it or you're a racist.
[2:29:51.280 --> 2:29:52.280]  Here it is.
[2:29:52.280 --> 2:29:55.280]  You may have heard about a virus called COVID-19.
[2:29:55.280 --> 2:29:57.280]  It's a virus that is extremely contagious.
[2:29:57.280 --> 2:30:04.280]  You may have it now with no symptoms and may pass it off to someone who may never even know they caught it.
[2:30:04.280 --> 2:30:06.280]  This is why we made hydroxy clean.
[2:30:06.280 --> 2:30:07.280]  It's amazing.
[2:30:07.280 --> 2:30:14.280]  Watch how hydroxy clean unleashes the power of hydroxychloroquine making engineered viruses disappear like magic.
[2:30:14.280 --> 2:30:16.280]  Without vaccines or microchips.
[2:30:16.280 --> 2:30:19.280]  For boomers, hydroxy clean is a must.
[2:30:19.280 --> 2:30:24.280]  It goes deep down into the circulatory system, gets rid of the rona and the cough.
[2:30:24.280 --> 2:30:28.280]  Have you ever spread an asymptomatic disease to someone who didn't know they got it?
[2:30:28.280 --> 2:30:31.280]  Well, hydroxy clean is tough on man-made viruses.
[2:30:31.280 --> 2:30:35.280]  Without the damaging effects of sterilizing hundreds of thousands of Indian children.
[2:30:35.280 --> 2:30:37.280]  Some talking heads say.
[2:30:37.280 --> 2:30:38.280]  No hydroxy clean.
[2:30:38.280 --> 2:30:39.280]  Orange man bad.
[2:30:39.280 --> 2:30:42.280]  But hydroxy clean safely removes the virus.
[2:30:42.280 --> 2:30:43.280]  Even on boomers.
[2:30:43.280 --> 2:30:46.280]  It's the rona remover for the people you love.
[2:30:46.280 --> 2:30:50.280]  Add a scoop of hydroxy clean to every dose of zinc in the Zithromycin.
[2:30:50.280 --> 2:30:52.280]  It'll boost the rona removing power.
[2:30:52.280 --> 2:30:53.280]  Don't just clean it.
[2:30:53.280 --> 2:30:55.280]  Hydroxy clean it.
[2:30:55.280 --> 2:30:59.280]  Works great for COVID-19.
[2:30:59.280 --> 2:31:02.280]  So we know, though, that it gets serious.
[2:31:02.280 --> 2:31:06.280]  That Z-PAC kills the bacteria that can carry the virus.
[2:31:06.280 --> 2:31:09.280]  If you have zinc and take hydroxychloroquine, it pushes in the cells.
[2:31:09.280 --> 2:31:10.280]  That's what all the studies show.
[2:31:10.280 --> 2:31:14.280]  They're trying to, like, say vitamin C isn't good to stop scurvy, or oxygen isn't good for humans,
[2:31:14.280 --> 2:31:16.280]  or that plants don't need water.
[2:31:16.280 --> 2:31:19.280]  We all know they need brontos, what they crave.
[2:31:19.280 --> 2:31:28.280]  I mean, this war on the fact that this is a disease of deficiency of vitamin D3, of zinc, and C.
[2:31:28.280 --> 2:31:31.280]  I mean, how evil is it they're trying to cover that up as well?
[2:31:31.280 --> 2:31:35.280]  Yeah, it's actually pretty disturbing.
[2:31:35.280 --> 2:31:40.280]  When you consider that these are things that we could be doing preventatively,
[2:31:40.280 --> 2:31:49.280]  a lot of people already were taking vitamin supplements and washing their hands and stuff like that to stay safe and healthy.
[2:31:49.280 --> 2:31:51.280]  I don't see why it's such a...
[2:31:51.280 --> 2:31:56.280]  We're being taught this giant new phobia with Fauci saying, don't ever shake hands again.
[2:31:56.280 --> 2:31:57.280]  What a cult!
[2:31:57.280 --> 2:31:59.280]  Completely absurd.
[2:31:59.280 --> 2:32:01.280]  And I don't think that people are going to accept it.
[2:32:01.280 --> 2:32:06.280]  I think they've overplayed their hand on this, and I think that when they try to roll it out again,
[2:32:06.280 --> 2:32:10.280]  there will be massive pushback and that they'll never, ever be able to do this again.
[2:32:10.280 --> 2:32:11.280]  No, I agree with you.
[2:32:11.280 --> 2:32:15.280]  But if they get away with it, then they may try a new scam.
[2:32:15.280 --> 2:32:16.280]  So that's why...
[2:32:16.280 --> 2:32:18.280]  I mean, I think they should really be punished for what they've done.
[2:32:18.280 --> 2:32:19.280]  I mean, all their models were wrong.
[2:32:19.280 --> 2:32:20.280]  They were all lies.
[2:32:20.280 --> 2:32:23.280]  The fact that they organized it is how you can bring them down.
[2:32:23.280 --> 2:32:24.280]  I mean, they've really been caught red-handed.
[2:32:24.280 --> 2:32:28.280]  In closing, what do you make of Trump's executive order saying he's going after big tech?
[2:32:28.280 --> 2:32:31.280]  Do you think this guy's going to have it?
[2:32:31.280 --> 2:32:32.280]  Yes.
[2:32:32.280 --> 2:32:33.280]  I think it most likely will happen.
[2:32:33.280 --> 2:32:35.280]  I mean, he's the president, right?
[2:32:35.280 --> 2:32:37.280]  So, yeah, I think that he'll...
[2:32:37.280 --> 2:32:38.280]  Well, he wants to lose.
[2:32:38.280 --> 2:32:39.280]  He'll sit there and do it, I think.
[2:32:39.280 --> 2:32:41.280]  I mean, we're pretty far behind the A-ball here.
[2:32:41.280 --> 2:32:43.280]  It doesn't matter how popular he is.
[2:32:43.280 --> 2:32:46.280]  They're mailing out hundreds of millions of fake ballots right now.
[2:32:46.280 --> 2:32:50.280]  Yeah, it's a pretty disturbing situation.
[2:32:50.280 --> 2:32:55.280]  You've got all these CEO, little chicken-neck people that are working with the Chai comms
[2:32:55.280 --> 2:32:58.280]  that have literally hijacked the country, and they're all so arrogant,
[2:32:58.280 --> 2:33:00.280]  they think we're going to just keep taking it.
[2:33:00.280 --> 2:33:01.280]  That's not how this works.
[2:33:01.280 --> 2:33:09.280]  Yeah, it's our duty to point out the absurdity and to resist it at every angle.
[2:33:09.280 --> 2:33:13.280]  Well, can't wait to see your next work media bear at YouTube Media Bear.
[2:33:13.280 --> 2:33:14.280]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[2:33:14.280 --> 2:33:15.280]  God bless you, my friend.
[2:33:15.280 --> 2:33:17.280]  Thanks, bud.
[2:33:17.280 --> 2:33:19.280]  Oh, you like Super Blue?
[2:33:19.280 --> 2:33:23.280]  Yeah, I wanted to mention that this was what I was brushing my teeth with in the video.
[2:33:23.280 --> 2:33:27.280]  Well, hold on to that, because the Democrats tell me,
[2:33:27.280 --> 2:33:30.280]  if I try to sell that again, they'll arrest me, even though it's totally legal.
[2:33:30.280 --> 2:33:34.280]  But hey, it's the same Democrats up in New York that ran the death camps for the old people,
[2:33:34.280 --> 2:33:36.280]  so we got a surprise for them.
[2:33:36.280 --> 2:33:37.280]  Thank you so much, sir.

[2:35:03.280 --> 2:35:05.280]  Let me just hone in on one of the products.

[2:35:43.280 --> 2:35:50.280]  It took hundreds and hundreds of years of human civilization to build up the world economy to where it is.
[2:35:50.280 --> 2:35:56.280]  Every economist is on record saying that as this economy has been shut down for two months,
[2:35:56.280 --> 2:36:02.280]  it is going to be a death sentence to the third world and a horrible nightmarish collapse for the first world
[2:36:02.280 --> 2:36:06.280]  and that the general public is going to go into deep, deep debt to the mega banks.
[2:36:06.280 --> 2:36:09.280]  They're not going to have medical ID cards, force inoculations.
[2:36:09.280 --> 2:36:13.280]  We are now in a giant dystopia.
[2:36:13.280 --> 2:36:20.280]  But a lot of people are waking up and there is a major backlash taking place against this tyranny.
[2:36:20.280 --> 2:36:27.280]  We must all rediscover our bill of rights, rediscover our constitution and our backbone and start saying no to people
[2:36:27.280 --> 2:36:32.280]  who take this moral high ground and say, shut your business down, shut your life down, it will save lives.
[2:36:32.280 --> 2:36:37.280]  No, it's caused millions to already starve to death, tens of millions more.
[2:36:37.280 --> 2:36:41.280]  So the cowards who went along with this with your virtues signaling, you have destroyed your life and our lives.
[2:36:41.280 --> 2:36:43.280]  Congratulations.
[2:36:43.280 --> 2:36:45.280]  Now it's official.
[2:36:45.280 --> 2:36:50.280]  The United Nations came out yesterday and said the COVID emergency will last five years.
[2:36:50.280 --> 2:36:58.280]  And the UK government said you must all carry cell phones outside or you'll be arrested because we have to track your social distancing
[2:36:58.280 --> 2:37:02.280]  and you're only allowed to have a list of 10 people that you visit.
[2:37:02.280 --> 2:37:06.280]  And if you go outside that list of 10, you'll be permanently detained.
[2:37:06.280 --> 2:37:14.280]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this is the new world order where they let the criminals out of jail, the rapists, the child molesters, the murderers
[2:37:14.280 --> 2:37:18.280]  and where you are now non-essential and a prisoner.
[2:37:18.280 --> 2:37:23.280]  From the beginning of my research, it was clear the globalist are an authoritarian anti-human group.
[2:37:23.280 --> 2:37:30.280]  They have to put this electronic straight jacket on us before they carry out their end game, which is global depopulation.
[2:37:30.280 --> 2:37:34.280]  So you see, submitting to them is death.
[2:37:34.280 --> 2:37:41.280]  The only way to stop them is to expose them, to hate their guts and realize they are humanity's mortal enemy.
[2:37:41.280 --> 2:37:45.280]  Wake up or die.
[2:37:45.280 --> 2:37:54.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:37:54.280 --> 2:38:07.280]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[2:38:07.280 --> 2:38:11.280]  All right, you have Jason Jones coming up with a trick for it.
[2:38:11.280 --> 2:38:13.280]  Yes, always a powerful hour.
[2:38:13.280 --> 2:38:15.280]  Then the war room.
[2:38:15.280 --> 2:38:17.280]  Right now, Alex Jones, your host.
[2:38:17.280 --> 2:38:24.280]  Want to go to April, Hoke Sheel, Trish, Patrick and Lisa Michael before we end this hour.
[2:38:24.280 --> 2:38:27.280]  We're going to go to the order the calls were received.
[2:38:27.280 --> 2:38:31.280]  I guess up front would be Hoke Sheila.
[2:38:31.280 --> 2:38:32.280]  I'm pronouncing that right.
[2:38:32.280 --> 2:38:33.280]  It's out the code.
[2:38:33.280 --> 2:38:34.280]  Go ahead.
[2:38:34.280 --> 2:38:35.280]  Thanks for holding.
[2:38:35.280 --> 2:38:37.280]  You're pronouncing that right, Alex.
[2:38:37.280 --> 2:38:38.280]  Thank you.
[2:38:38.280 --> 2:38:40.280]  So what do you make of what's going on?
[2:38:40.280 --> 2:38:48.280]  Well, partner, last time I called you, you were mentioning about the martial law that you had been reading about that was going on in South Dakota.
[2:38:48.280 --> 2:38:53.280]  And I wanted to give you an update on what's happening on one of our reservations.
[2:38:53.280 --> 2:39:15.280]  The Cheyenne River Sioux tribe just passed a tribal ordinance number 83, which suspends tribal sovereignty, allowing the state to come onto the res and control traffic, suspends HIPAA laws and can get people put in jail if they're found to be COVID carriers or committed.
[2:39:15.280 --> 2:39:18.280]  And it can even control what people are distributed to eat.
[2:39:18.280 --> 2:39:23.280]  So everything they do to the American people, they test first on the American Indians.
[2:39:23.280 --> 2:39:24.280]  Oh, you're absolutely.
[2:39:24.280 --> 2:39:26.280]  That's the beta test.
[2:39:26.280 --> 2:39:27.280]  Yes.
[2:39:27.280 --> 2:39:31.280]  So what's happening to you is for everybody, which they admit is the plan.
[2:39:31.280 --> 2:39:32.280]  Wow.
[2:39:32.280 --> 2:39:37.280]  Total surveillance, total control, suspension of your rights, crazy.
[2:39:37.280 --> 2:39:41.280]  They went until they basically have passed a resolution, which they can't do.
[2:39:41.280 --> 2:39:50.280]  Under a 1968 American Indian Civil Rights Act, no tribal council can pass any law that violates our constitutional rights.
[2:39:50.280 --> 2:39:53.280]  Well, I was about to say, I mean, a state or even the feds aren't supposed to pass something that does that.
[2:39:53.280 --> 2:39:55.280]  So how can another nation do it?
[2:39:55.280 --> 2:39:56.280]  Yeah.
[2:39:56.280 --> 2:39:58.280]  And that's what they're doing right now.
[2:39:58.280 --> 2:40:00.280]  They're beta testing it on Cheyenne River.
[2:40:00.280 --> 2:40:08.280]  So what you're seeing in the news about all these checkpoints, that's to get us into a martial law state in South Dakota on the reservations.
[2:40:08.280 --> 2:40:10.280]  They're doing it now.
[2:40:10.280 --> 2:40:13.280]  Well, we know about the sterilization on the reservations as well.
[2:40:13.280 --> 2:40:14.280]  It's really been.
[2:40:14.280 --> 2:40:16.280]  And again, it's all compartmentalized.
[2:40:16.280 --> 2:40:19.280]  It's not the average person doing it, but it doesn't give an excuse.
[2:40:19.280 --> 2:40:22.280]  People that aren't involved are acquiescence.
[2:40:22.280 --> 2:40:24.280]  Now that we know it's going on, makes us parties to it.
[2:40:24.280 --> 2:40:26.280]  If we don't say no to it.
[2:40:26.280 --> 2:40:27.280]  Exactly.
[2:40:27.280 --> 2:40:33.280]  And so what they're saying now is that they're bringing down the ratcheting of the lockdown orders.
[2:40:33.280 --> 2:40:34.280]  I don't believe it.
[2:40:34.280 --> 2:40:38.280]  I think it's as you said, the second wave, maybe the bio attack.
[2:40:38.280 --> 2:40:41.280]  But they just instituted this on the reservations.
[2:40:41.280 --> 2:40:43.280]  Cheyenne River anyway.
[2:40:43.280 --> 2:40:47.280]  Well, you saw Gates say three weeks ago with coberry said, Oh, this is really just a test.
[2:40:47.280 --> 2:40:49.280]  The real one's coming.
[2:40:49.280 --> 2:40:52.280]  So again, they get us locked none of the tests, then the big one hits.
[2:40:52.280 --> 2:40:55.280]  And I think if people don't expose that, we have no hope.
[2:40:55.280 --> 2:40:56.280]  I mean, this is big folks.
[2:40:56.280 --> 2:40:57.280]  This is real.
[2:40:57.280 --> 2:40:59.280]  And this is, this is deadly dangerous.
[2:40:59.280 --> 2:41:00.280]  God bless you, sir.
[2:41:00.280 --> 2:41:01.280]  Thanks for calling.
[2:41:01.280 --> 2:41:02.280]  Oh, Sheila.
[2:41:02.280 --> 2:41:06.280]  Okay, let's go to Patrick in Texas, then Michael Patrick, go ahead.
[2:41:06.280 --> 2:41:08.280]  Patrick, go ahead.
[2:41:08.280 --> 2:41:09.280]  Yeah.
[2:41:09.280 --> 2:41:12.280]  So I was calling reference to a National Plant for Trump.
[2:41:12.280 --> 2:41:17.280]  I'm talking a lot in the past, but the thing we want to do is if your phone's a little distorted,
[2:41:17.280 --> 2:41:20.280]  can you back off of it?
[2:41:20.280 --> 2:41:22.280]  Go ahead and try again.
[2:41:22.280 --> 2:41:23.280]  Okay.
[2:41:23.280 --> 2:41:26.280]  The big thing we need to do is just have an all out front attack on the globalists.
[2:41:26.280 --> 2:41:29.280]  And you need to come at them with multiple parameters.
[2:41:29.280 --> 2:41:34.280]  It needs to be, you know, no less than say five to 10 different major items that they hold here.
[2:41:34.280 --> 2:41:38.280]  And, you know, a lot of things that really get to them is like with Flynn.
[2:41:38.280 --> 2:41:41.280]  Who cares what's going on with the corrupt judge and all that crap?
[2:41:41.280 --> 2:41:43.280]  Hire him back immediately.
[2:41:43.280 --> 2:41:46.280]  It would have been a role and give him a title.
[2:41:46.280 --> 2:41:47.280]  No, I agree.
[2:41:47.280 --> 2:41:51.280]  Hire Flynn back and make him chief of staff and then just bring in the whole military.
[2:41:51.280 --> 2:41:52.280]  Exactly.
[2:41:52.280 --> 2:41:55.280]  It's not the military's perfect, but let me tell you, Trump brings in the military.
[2:41:55.280 --> 2:41:56.280]  They're loyal to America.
[2:41:56.280 --> 2:41:58.280]  They're going to do what they're told.
[2:41:58.280 --> 2:42:02.280]  Just kick all the bureaucrats and the lawyers out.
[2:42:02.280 --> 2:42:03.280]  Exactly.
[2:42:03.280 --> 2:42:07.280]  Get away off the little corrupt pieces of social trash that we don't need in that environment.
[2:42:07.280 --> 2:42:10.280]  And everything is going to go on a statement.
[2:42:10.280 --> 2:42:11.280]  Make an issue.
[2:42:11.280 --> 2:42:13.280]  It's an executive order.
[2:42:13.280 --> 2:42:16.280]  You know, it's our intent to deport all illegal aliens immediately.
[2:42:16.280 --> 2:42:18.280]  Do an imminent threat to our election integrity.
[2:42:18.280 --> 2:42:20.280]  You know, put something out there.
[2:42:20.280 --> 2:42:21.280]  Let them know.
[2:42:21.280 --> 2:42:22.280]  We're not playing around.
[2:42:22.280 --> 2:42:25.280]  You're going to take out a huge percentage of their fraudulent voting base.
[2:42:25.280 --> 2:42:26.280]  No, I agree.
[2:42:26.280 --> 2:42:27.280]  Trump has to go.
[2:42:27.280 --> 2:42:29.280]  And again, it's not even illegal to the enemy.
[2:42:29.280 --> 2:42:30.280]  They're just trying to get a better life.
[2:42:30.280 --> 2:42:31.280]  They're used as a weapon.
[2:42:31.280 --> 2:42:33.280]  The Democrats are using him as a weapon.
[2:42:33.280 --> 2:42:34.280]  So yeah, exactly.
[2:42:34.280 --> 2:42:35.280]  Block it all.
[2:42:35.280 --> 2:42:36.280]  I totally agree.
[2:42:36.280 --> 2:42:37.280]  Patrick, sorry, but your phone's breaking up.
[2:42:37.280 --> 2:42:39.280]  You made good points, but it's hard to pick up.
[2:42:39.280 --> 2:42:40.280]  Thank you.
[2:42:40.280 --> 2:42:41.280]  Call me back again when your phone's better.
[2:42:41.280 --> 2:42:43.280]  Michael in California, you're on the air.
[2:42:43.280 --> 2:42:44.280]  Go ahead.
[2:42:44.280 --> 2:42:47.280]  Hey, it's finally, it's great to finally talk to Alex.
[2:42:47.280 --> 2:42:48.280]  Great to talk to you, brother.
[2:42:48.280 --> 2:42:49.280]  What's on your mind?
[2:42:49.280 --> 2:42:50.280]  Okay.
[2:42:50.280 --> 2:42:51.280]  This is very important.
[2:42:51.280 --> 2:42:58.280]  I live in Hollywood and the New World Order system has been set up here for a very long time now.
[2:42:58.280 --> 2:43:03.280]  And, um, I think it is because of, you know, because of the fact that I'm half black, they
[2:43:03.280 --> 2:43:06.280]  have targeted me and my family.
[2:43:06.280 --> 2:43:09.280]  Um, uh, my, my neighbor was Ed Buck.
[2:43:09.280 --> 2:43:14.280]  And, um, oh, well, no wonder you got targeted for what you didn't know what you saw.
[2:43:14.280 --> 2:43:19.280]  That was again, one of the main, uh, cures for their satanic rituals.
[2:43:19.280 --> 2:43:23.280]  You know what they've been doing this to my family for way longer than everything that,
[2:43:23.280 --> 2:43:26.280]  you know, has been exposed about him.
[2:43:26.280 --> 2:43:30.280]  Uh, but, you know, the good thing is, is I found out exactly what's going on and how
[2:43:30.280 --> 2:43:31.280]  they're doing it.
[2:43:31.280 --> 2:43:32.280]  And they have people everywhere.
[2:43:32.280 --> 2:43:34.280]  They're all around us.
[2:43:34.280 --> 2:43:37.280]  And we are being watched through our phones and monitored.
[2:43:37.280 --> 2:43:44.280]  And, um, if we take down this record, the five Silicon Valley companies are in your
[2:43:44.280 --> 2:43:48.280]  email, in your text messages, in your live feeds, they admit, quote, watching you.
[2:43:48.280 --> 2:43:51.280]  Now they're in the news like, Oh, we watch what you text message.
[2:43:51.280 --> 2:43:52.280]  They're in our phones.
[2:43:52.280 --> 2:43:56.280]  If the NSA did that, they'd be arrested and they should, but the left doesn't.
[2:43:56.280 --> 2:43:57.280]  It's like cutesy.
[2:43:57.280 --> 2:44:00.280]  It's a giant mafia that gave themselves this power.
[2:44:00.280 --> 2:44:03.280]  But as long as we expose them, they have no power.
[2:44:03.280 --> 2:44:10.280]  You know what, uh, I don't know if you remember when, uh, Trump gave a speech, um, after the
[2:44:10.280 --> 2:44:15.280]  Iran incident in the beginning of the year, he was slurring a lot of words and he almost,
[2:44:15.280 --> 2:44:17.280]  um, he looked like he was going to fall or something.
[2:44:17.280 --> 2:44:18.280]  I remember that.
[2:44:18.280 --> 2:44:19.280]  Yeah.
[2:44:19.280 --> 2:44:20.280]  Yeah.
[2:44:20.280 --> 2:44:22.280]  And that's the way they, uh, kill people here.
[2:44:22.280 --> 2:44:27.280]  And I know because they've been doing it to me, they first put something into your food
[2:44:27.280 --> 2:44:31.280]  that makes you susceptible to what the people they have everywhere around you.
[2:44:31.280 --> 2:44:34.280]  It's like a big chess game on a binary one.
[2:44:34.280 --> 2:44:38.280]  Well, you don't think world leaders get hit with binary weapons.
[2:44:38.280 --> 2:44:41.280]  Then you're, I mean, it definitely goes on.
[2:44:41.280 --> 2:44:43.280]  And, and we know Trump's been jacked with.
[2:44:43.280 --> 2:44:47.280]  I talked to people in the White House and they had to literally have the secret service
[2:44:47.280 --> 2:44:49.280]  randomly go out and get him food.
[2:44:49.280 --> 2:44:52.280]  Like they say, they just randomly go to this store, go to that store.
[2:44:52.280 --> 2:44:55.280]  I don't know who's, but you don't think the left's trying to poison the president folks.
[2:44:55.280 --> 2:44:57.280]  They're all the news saying killing.
[2:44:57.280 --> 2:44:59.280]  I mean, let me take some.
[2:44:59.280 --> 2:45:03.280]  Sean Hannity can't even go out to eat in New York now.
[2:45:03.280 --> 2:45:05.280]  I'll leave it at that.
[2:45:05.280 --> 2:45:10.280]  So I'm not supposed to tell the stories, but the left like takes stakes.
[2:45:10.280 --> 2:45:13.280]  You're going to eat and wipes their asses with them and everything else.
[2:45:13.280 --> 2:45:15.280]  I mean, this is war.
[2:45:15.280 --> 2:45:17.280]  Michael, thank you so much for the call.
[2:45:17.280 --> 2:45:20.280]  John Michigan, thanks for holding your own here.
[2:45:20.280 --> 2:45:22.280]  Hi, thank you.
[2:45:22.280 --> 2:45:25.280]  I would like to talk about the elderly murders.
[2:45:25.280 --> 2:45:29.280]  My mom was murdered January 1st in a nursing home.
[2:45:29.280 --> 2:45:32.280]  I tried everything I could to save her.
[2:45:32.280 --> 2:45:34.280]  She was drug to death.
[2:45:34.280 --> 2:45:40.280]  I filed an emergency petition in court to save her and I have recordings of everything.
[2:45:40.280 --> 2:45:42.280]  The judge didn't have time to hear it.
[2:45:42.280 --> 2:45:44.280]  The nursing home lied on the stand.
[2:45:44.280 --> 2:45:46.280]  APS lied on the stand.
[2:45:46.280 --> 2:45:51.280]  So he rescheduled the hearing for two weeks later.
[2:45:51.280 --> 2:45:56.280]  I knew she wasn't going to be alive and she was dead.
[2:45:56.280 --> 2:46:00.280]  And they had her on morphine, advan, fentanyl.
[2:46:00.280 --> 2:46:03.280]  They increased her fentanyl on the day she died even though she wasn't waking up.
[2:46:03.280 --> 2:46:05.280]  He knew what was happening to her.
[2:46:05.280 --> 2:46:07.280]  He was so scared.
[2:46:07.280 --> 2:46:08.280]  She didn't want to die.
[2:46:08.280 --> 2:46:10.280]  She said she didn't want to be on hospice.
[2:46:10.280 --> 2:46:14.280]  Like these are six people and they falsify records.
[2:46:14.280 --> 2:46:16.280]  And there's a bunch of lies.
[2:46:16.280 --> 2:46:19.280]  The insurance companies pay to kill old people.
[2:46:19.280 --> 2:46:20.280]  What you just said is key.
[2:46:20.280 --> 2:46:21.280]  She knew what was happening.
[2:46:21.280 --> 2:46:23.280]  What did she say to you?
[2:46:23.280 --> 2:46:27.280]  She said, why are they doing this to me?
[2:46:27.280 --> 2:46:30.280]  And I'm like, she said she didn't want to die.
[2:46:30.280 --> 2:46:31.280]  Point blank period.
[2:46:31.280 --> 2:46:34.280]  Well, it's just like the black man begging for his life.
[2:46:34.280 --> 2:46:35.280]  George Floyd, he said, you're killing me.
[2:46:35.280 --> 2:46:36.280]  He started laughing.
[2:46:36.280 --> 2:46:38.280]  He goes, he's like, I don't kill me.
[2:46:38.280 --> 2:46:41.280]  That's like a really strong and daring point.
[2:46:41.280 --> 2:46:44.280]  He's like laughing like, man, you're going to really kill me.
[2:46:44.280 --> 2:46:47.280]  And like, she was sitting there begging for her life or they just kill her, huh?
[2:46:47.280 --> 2:46:48.280]  Yes.
[2:46:48.280 --> 2:46:50.280]  And I tried to get an autopsy.
[2:46:50.280 --> 2:46:52.280]  They wouldn't allow me to get an autopsy.
[2:46:52.280 --> 2:46:56.280]  I called the police to investigate it because I have all the evidence.
[2:46:56.280 --> 2:46:57.280]  They won't do anything.
[2:46:57.280 --> 2:46:59.280]  Well, they've got actuaries in the hospital.
[2:46:59.280 --> 2:47:02.280]  The nursing home gets told this is the care you get by a computer.
[2:47:02.280 --> 2:47:03.280]  They go, oh, it's a computer.
[2:47:03.280 --> 2:47:04.280]  So it's okay.
[2:47:04.280 --> 2:47:06.280]  And then that person's money has run out.
[2:47:06.280 --> 2:47:08.280]  They just kill them.
[2:47:08.280 --> 2:47:10.280]  Yeah, that's what happened.
[2:47:10.280 --> 2:47:13.280]  Bill Gates said, he said, hey, we got to kill grandma.
[2:47:13.280 --> 2:47:14.280]  Yeah.
[2:47:14.280 --> 2:47:16.280]  Well, hey, how about, how about Bill Gates goes first?
[2:47:16.280 --> 2:47:20.280]  You know, I don't wish any harm myself, but if Bill Gates wants so much death,
[2:47:20.280 --> 2:47:23.280]  I'd respect him more if he pulled out a knife and just went,
[2:47:23.280 --> 2:47:26.280]  you know, show me what big man you are right now.
[2:47:26.280 --> 2:47:27.280]  Let's see it, man.
[2:47:27.280 --> 2:47:29.280]  Let's see you cut your ear, ear to ear, man.
[2:47:29.280 --> 2:47:31.280]  Or let's do sepacoo, like boom, all the way.
[2:47:31.280 --> 2:47:34.280]  Let's show me what a big man you are.
[2:47:34.280 --> 2:47:36.280]  Oh, no, no, no, no, you want me to die.
[2:47:36.280 --> 2:47:38.280]  You want everybody else to die.
[2:47:38.280 --> 2:47:44.280]  Well, I'm sorry to hear that about your family, my friend.
[2:47:44.280 --> 2:47:49.280]  I'm fighting for justice and letting people know what's going on.
[2:47:49.280 --> 2:47:50.280]  That's all I can do.
[2:47:50.280 --> 2:47:52.280]  You know, go pick it out in front of where they did it.
[2:47:52.280 --> 2:47:55.280]  And people driving in just say, beware, they're going to kill your family.
[2:47:55.280 --> 2:47:58.280]  You don't know the power of third dimensional war.
[2:47:58.280 --> 2:48:01.280]  Believe me, I don't even have, I don't know the power.
[2:48:01.280 --> 2:48:03.280]  The power is transcendent.
[2:48:03.280 --> 2:48:07.280]  We must hit the first wave, third dimension warfare.
[2:48:07.280 --> 2:48:11.280]  We all have to physically put the skin in the game because it's going down.
[2:48:11.280 --> 2:48:14.280]  And there are going to be some white people do bad things to black people.
[2:48:14.280 --> 2:48:16.280]  There are going to be some white people do bad things to white people.
[2:48:16.280 --> 2:48:18.280]  There's going to be brown people do bad things, whatever.
[2:48:18.280 --> 2:48:19.280]  It doesn't matter.
[2:48:19.280 --> 2:48:21.280]  We know the manipulation behind it.
[2:48:21.280 --> 2:48:23.280]  We have to come together for human dignity and freedom.
[2:48:23.280 --> 2:48:24.280]  We've got our own scores to settle.
[2:48:24.280 --> 2:48:25.280]  We'll do that, don't worry.
[2:48:25.280 --> 2:48:27.280]  But the New World Order is the big threat.
[2:48:27.280 --> 2:48:28.280]  It's the alien threat.
[2:48:28.280 --> 2:48:30.280]  Hour number four straight ahead.
[2:48:30.280 --> 2:48:33.280]  Trade Stay Wheels.
[2:48:33.280 --> 2:48:35.280]  This is the end, my friends.
[2:48:35.280 --> 2:48:43.280]  My only friends, the end of our elaborate plans, the end of everything that stands the end.
[2:48:43.280 --> 2:48:46.280]  The safety, the delusion.
[2:48:46.280 --> 2:48:51.280]  It's all over, ladies and gentlemen, because there was only the mirage of safety.
[2:48:51.280 --> 2:48:57.280]  Movies and partying and living like children, never growing up, never caring about other people.
[2:48:57.280 --> 2:49:01.280]  This delivered us into the hands of tyranny.
[2:49:01.280 --> 2:49:08.280]  Just like the history book shows, just like the Bible states, every time Israel became corrupt and evil and turned away from God,
[2:49:08.280 --> 2:49:15.280]  they were brought into captivity because their people sold out to special interests and were infiltrated by spies,
[2:49:15.280 --> 2:49:17.280]  and then they were enslaved.
[2:49:17.280 --> 2:49:20.280]  We are repeating that again today.
[2:49:20.280 --> 2:49:25.280]  Compliance and going along with this system leads to absolute bondage.
[2:49:25.280 --> 2:49:28.280]  Info Wars has decided to fight for freedom.
[2:49:28.280 --> 2:49:33.280]  Info Wars has had great victory thanks to your support and your prayers.
[2:49:59.280 --> 2:50:03.280]  We're having an open discussion about the real state of the world,
[2:50:03.280 --> 2:50:08.280]  not the establishment of talking points that are put out by the Council on Fine Relations,
[2:50:08.280 --> 2:50:11.280]  the Bilderberg Group, the Davos Group, and other clubs.
[2:50:11.280 --> 2:50:16.280]  We're pushing for a pro-human future where we build a planet and beyond,
[2:50:16.280 --> 2:50:19.280]  based on humans, for humans, by humans.
[2:50:19.280 --> 2:50:22.280]  Not a world where the establishment hate themselves,
[2:50:22.280 --> 2:50:26.280]  protect their hate onto us and decide we're going to have a post-human world.
[2:50:26.280 --> 2:50:29.280]  I'm really excited to know that Info Wars has your support,
[2:50:29.280 --> 2:50:57.280]  and I want to thank you all for being pro-human and pro-God.
[2:50:59.280 --> 2:51:03.280]  I had myself a drink and I joined in a polka game.
[2:51:03.280 --> 2:51:08.280]  The dealer was a woman, so I asked her for her name.
[2:51:08.280 --> 2:51:10.280]  All right, one more caller.
[2:51:10.280 --> 2:51:16.280]  Trisha in Michigan, and then we're going to hand the baton over to Jason Jones.
[2:51:16.280 --> 2:51:19.280]  And then we got the war room coming up after that.
[2:51:19.280 --> 2:51:21.280]  Man, what an incredible time.
[2:51:21.280 --> 2:51:23.280]  I mean, the next 158 days is just so insane.
[2:51:23.280 --> 2:51:26.280]  And beyond that, we're going to look back on this as easy times.
[2:51:26.280 --> 2:51:28.280]  This is biblical, what's going down.
[2:51:28.280 --> 2:51:30.280]  Trisha in Michigan, thanks for holding her on the air.
[2:51:30.280 --> 2:51:31.280]  Welcome.
[2:51:31.280 --> 2:51:32.280]  Hi, Alex.
[2:51:32.280 --> 2:51:33.280]  Can you hear me okay?
[2:51:33.280 --> 2:51:34.280]  I can.
[2:51:34.280 --> 2:51:35.280]  Thank you for calling.
[2:51:35.280 --> 2:51:36.280]  Okay, great.
[2:51:36.280 --> 2:51:39.280]  Hey, first of all, let's do a proper greeting like Paul the Apostle would.
[2:51:39.280 --> 2:51:44.280]  Grace and peace be unto you and all the callers and listeners out there worldwide.
[2:51:44.280 --> 2:51:49.280]  I called you back on April 22nd, and I'm the lady who works at the warehouse
[2:51:49.280 --> 2:51:51.280]  and was talking about the food coming in and out.
[2:51:51.280 --> 2:51:52.280]  Oh, yeah.
[2:51:52.280 --> 2:51:54.280]  We're having problems getting it out, yeah.
[2:51:54.280 --> 2:51:59.280]  Anyways, it's the Meyer warehouse that I work to and everybody knows I support the show.
[2:51:59.280 --> 2:52:02.280]  I wear all kinds of different shirts everywhere I go.
[2:52:02.280 --> 2:52:06.280]  And I do, of course, have the Info Wars mask that I wear under my nose.
[2:52:06.280 --> 2:52:10.280]  But I make sure if I have to wear one somewhere, it's an Info Wars mask.
[2:52:10.280 --> 2:52:12.280]  And they require us to wear them at work.
[2:52:12.280 --> 2:52:18.280]  And the day they initiated it, I said, okay, well, when you guys are going to start forcing the shots,
[2:52:18.280 --> 2:52:20.280]  that's when I guess I'm not going to be working.
[2:52:20.280 --> 2:52:24.280]  And I didn't get it. And I just quietly said I talked to my supervisor after that shortly.
[2:52:24.280 --> 2:52:28.280]  I said, you know, I'm just, I talked to him on the side, let him know different things.
[2:52:28.280 --> 2:52:32.280]  So everybody knows I support the show there, along with my son, Tate, that works there.
[2:52:32.280 --> 2:52:35.280]  I have most all of your shirts.
[2:52:35.280 --> 2:52:37.280]  I buy all kinds of the product.
[2:52:37.280 --> 2:52:39.280]  I'm plugging a little bit for you.
[2:52:39.280 --> 2:52:40.280]  No, you're incredible.
[2:52:40.280 --> 2:52:42.280]  Always the wrong aerostills because of you.
[2:52:42.280 --> 2:52:43.280]  So thank you.
[2:52:43.280 --> 2:52:47.280]  Oh, and I'm glad you're on there doing what you do, Alex, and everybody that's on there.
[2:52:47.280 --> 2:52:51.280]  And then my heart goes out to April. Remember, I don't, you probably don't remember.
[2:52:51.280 --> 2:52:53.280]  Maybe you do. My dad passed away in February.
[2:52:53.280 --> 2:52:56.280]  No, you called. I remember he talked about it in Michigan.
[2:52:56.280 --> 2:53:00.280]  Yeah. Well, he had dementia and he was not in the third stage.
[2:53:00.280 --> 2:53:05.280]  He was like in the middle stage and it took, I was always day at his girl because I was always the one
[2:53:05.280 --> 2:53:07.280]  who helped him change his semi-tires.
[2:53:07.280 --> 2:53:09.280]  Hold on a second.
[2:53:09.280 --> 2:53:15.280]  Anyway, I did everything I could to keep him out of there because I wanted to always do what I could for him
[2:53:15.280 --> 2:53:20.280]  and I finally put him in there because it was a bit much for me.
[2:53:20.280 --> 2:53:22.280]  I was working two jobs.
[2:53:22.280 --> 2:53:25.280]  No, I know. Taking care of all folks is hard.
[2:53:25.280 --> 2:53:29.280]  But I figured he would be safer in there and things seemed to be okay.
[2:53:29.280 --> 2:53:34.280]  He started with ill one week and I was just being precautionary like everybody else.
[2:53:34.280 --> 2:53:40.280]  But, you know, with listening to the show like I do for long-time listeners, second-time caller,
[2:53:40.280 --> 2:53:45.280]  I believe that's what happened with my dad because they called me.
[2:53:45.280 --> 2:53:48.280]  They said, oh, you know, he's not going to be around very long.
[2:53:48.280 --> 2:53:52.280]  You know, they wanted to know if I wanted a hospice. It was like a shock to me.
[2:53:52.280 --> 2:54:00.280]  I'm like, no. I mean, it's like, but then it was like the symptoms he was having was he was having a hard time breathing.
[2:54:00.280 --> 2:54:07.280]  And of course, he had preexisting condition, which, you know, I know now that that's probably what happened with everything that's getting exposed.
[2:54:07.280 --> 2:54:12.280]  And I know that eventually what we all do comes around, goes around,
[2:54:12.280 --> 2:54:14.280]  and we're all going to get old someday.
[2:54:14.280 --> 2:54:20.280]  Just like seeing that gentleman beating that other gentleman that the other home was heartening to.
[2:54:20.280 --> 2:54:26.280]  But who, hey, if you really do come to Michigan, please get in touch with me.
[2:54:26.280 --> 2:54:30.280]  I'll make sure I can gather everybody I know to be there to support you.
[2:54:30.280 --> 2:54:32.280]  Well, I mean, I don't want to just shoot my mouth.
[2:54:32.280 --> 2:54:36.280]  I'm really mad at the governors of California, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New York.
[2:54:36.280 --> 2:54:38.280]  They, they sent those people to die.
[2:54:38.280 --> 2:54:42.280]  They know exactly what they did cold, bloody to boost their numbers of COVID.
[2:54:42.280 --> 2:54:48.280]  And I know they're evil, but to see them actually do it because they kill kids and they kill unborn babies.
[2:54:48.280 --> 2:54:54.280]  But man, like watching them do it on purpose to old people, it's, it's something like it doesn't make me hate them.
[2:54:54.280 --> 2:54:58.280]  It makes me feel ashamed that I can't stop them.
[2:54:58.280 --> 2:55:00.280]  And I'll be honest. I'm losing sleep about it.
[2:55:00.280 --> 2:55:04.280]  I mean, I, you know, I don't have violent feelings.
[2:55:04.280 --> 2:55:13.280]  I just feel like that we're joining their crime at this point if we don't stand up.
[2:55:13.280 --> 2:55:17.280]  So, you know, that's where this is all headed.
[2:55:17.280 --> 2:55:20.280]  Well, our strength, I'm sorry, I was cutting you off.
[2:55:20.280 --> 2:55:21.280]  No, no, no, listen.
[2:55:21.280 --> 2:55:23.280]  Our strength is knowing who we are in Christ.
[2:55:23.280 --> 2:55:28.280]  I listen to Joyce Myers a lot for encouragement and she preaches about Christ's hundredness.
[2:55:28.280 --> 2:55:30.280]  And it's like, I do get encouraged by that.
[2:55:30.280 --> 2:55:34.280]  I totally agree. I'm out of time. Jason Jones is taking over. I love you and I appreciate you.
[2:55:34.280 --> 2:55:35.280]  All right, I'm going to let him take over.
[2:55:35.280 --> 2:55:38.280]  But I mean, folks don't, it's going to get so obvious now.

[2:56:28.280 --> 2:56:30.280]  Again, thank you all for watching.

[2:56:37.280 --> 2:56:39.280]  And thank you all for your support. We are all in this together.
[2:57:07.280 --> 2:57:11.280]  You know what Alex said is true. These are biblical times.
[2:57:11.280 --> 2:57:15.280]  And you hear that woman in the last hours, tragic story about losing her mother.
[2:57:15.280 --> 2:57:25.280]  How many thousands and thousands of New Yorkers know how she feels just in the past couple of months because of the mistakes made by Governor Cuomo.
[2:57:25.280 --> 2:57:31.280]  And Alex was also right when he said the next 18 months is when the real work begins.
[2:57:31.280 --> 2:57:43.280]  Now as we begin to reopen our states, the government can handcuff you like they handcuffed me and throw you in the back of a police car to close your business.
[2:57:43.280 --> 2:57:52.280]  But they cannot arrest you to make your business grow, to make your business resurrect, to make your business a success, to make our communities a success.
[2:57:52.280 --> 2:57:56.280]  That's something all of us are going to have to do.
[2:57:56.280 --> 2:57:59.280]  And they're calling this the new normal.
[2:57:59.280 --> 2:58:07.280]  I wrote a book called The Race to Save Our Century with five principles of a healthy culture, a healthy civilization, a healthy nation state.
[2:58:07.280 --> 2:58:11.280]  Number one is you respect the enviable dignity of the human person.
[2:58:11.280 --> 2:58:18.280]  What we saw in Minneapolis this week shows an absolute disrespect for the dignity of the human person.
[2:58:18.280 --> 2:58:28.280]  What we've seen in New York City with Governor Cuomo sending people with COVID into old folks homes shows an absolute disrespect for the enviable dignity of the human person.
[2:58:28.280 --> 2:58:37.280]  What we're seeing with business owners being arrested and thrown into jail because they want to cut hair denies the intrinsic dignity of the human person.
[2:58:37.280 --> 2:58:43.280]  Number two, an adjust society is acknowledging a transcended moral order.
[2:58:43.280 --> 2:58:50.280]  As the Reverend Martin Luther King always used to say, adjust law is a man made law that corresponds to God's will.
[2:58:50.280 --> 2:58:56.280]  We no longer even have elected officials that want to conform their will to the Constitution.
[2:58:56.280 --> 2:59:00.280]  Let alone thinking about what's above the Constitution.
[2:59:00.280 --> 2:59:06.280]  Governor Cuomo said, I'm taking red hospitals, hospitals and rural communities.
[2:59:06.280 --> 2:59:08.280]  I'm taking your ventilators.
[2:59:08.280 --> 2:59:10.280]  I don't care if it's unconstitutional, sue me.
[2:59:10.280 --> 2:59:17.280]  So that's number two, acknowledging a law above the laws of man and acknowledging the Constitution.
[2:59:17.280 --> 2:59:18.280]  That's number two.
[2:59:18.280 --> 2:59:19.280]  Number three is subsidiary.
[2:59:19.280 --> 2:59:21.280]  This one is key.
[2:59:21.280 --> 2:59:29.280]  A healthy society, those institutions that are non governmental and closest to you have the most influence in your life.
[2:59:29.280 --> 2:59:41.280]  Your family, your church, your neighbors, distant, unelected bureaucracies like the CDC and the World Health Organization should have zero influence in your life.
[2:59:41.280 --> 2:59:43.280]  We've seen that turned upside down.
[2:59:43.280 --> 2:59:55.280]  Your dignity is not respected and the new normal, a law above the laws of man is not acknowledged and the new normal, distant, unelected bureaucracies is what controls your life.
[2:59:55.280 --> 3:00:03.280]  And intermediary institutions, if they're allowed to exist at all, is to be functionaries of these distant, unelected bureaucracies.
[3:00:03.280 --> 3:00:09.280]  Number four is your right to private property is the foundation of a just social order.
[3:00:09.280 --> 3:00:20.280]  We see now that your private property, and we're going to talk to Stephen Harriet about this, your business, your liberty and how you make your livelihood is not being respected.
[3:00:20.280 --> 3:00:22.280]  And number five is solidarity.
[3:00:22.280 --> 3:00:29.280]  We share the burdens of the vulnerable that we don't scapegoat or attack the vulnerable, which is what we're seeing today.
[3:00:29.280 --> 3:00:33.280]  So those five principles of a healthy society have been turned upside down.
[3:00:33.280 --> 3:00:40.280]  Stephen Harriet is my first guest. He is a writer, one of my favorite writers, but he's also one of the leaders of the reopened Wisconsin movement.
[3:00:40.280 --> 3:00:43.280]  Stephen, welcome to the Alex Jones show.
[3:00:43.280 --> 3:00:46.280]  Thanks for having me. Good to be here.
[3:00:46.280 --> 3:00:52.280]  So you've been one of the leaders of the reopened movement nationally. What's happening in Wisconsin now?
[3:00:52.280 --> 3:00:55.280]  So in Wisconsin, we're learning here's a hard lesson.
[3:00:55.280 --> 3:01:05.280]  The Supreme Court case about two weeks ago, Supreme Court case in Wisconsin shut down the governor's statewide lockdown order, right?
[3:01:05.280 --> 3:01:09.280]  But what that did is that it brought it down to the county level.
[3:01:09.280 --> 3:01:19.280]  Now, I live in Dane County, the county in which the capital is, and it is the most progressive, the most new normal of all of the counties in the state, probably.
[3:01:19.280 --> 3:01:25.280]  And it's amazing how you know what? The law is overrated in a way.
[3:01:25.280 --> 3:01:39.280]  You can't, you know, Gavin McKinnis has a bit on this where he says, you know, come to my house in an undisclosed location in New York City after I've been banned from every major social media platform,
[3:01:39.280 --> 3:01:42.280]  and I'm not sure I'll be on YouTube for much longer.
[3:01:42.280 --> 3:01:49.280]  Come to my house and tell me that I have a constitutional right to free speech, and I'll laugh bitterly, essentially.
[3:01:49.280 --> 3:02:08.280]  It doesn't actually count for much if in this new normal, as you call it, in this setting where our culture and the people, our neighbors even are enforcing a new normal that, as you mentioned, calls down higher authorities against us, right?
[3:02:08.280 --> 3:02:15.280]  Because we may have a constitutional right, we may have constitutional rights, those delineated in the First Amendment.
[3:02:15.280 --> 3:02:20.280]  But if everyone in the culture is hostile to it, doesn't end up counting for much, does it?
[3:02:20.280 --> 3:02:32.280]  So we have a huge responsibility to effect our neighbors, to spread the word about not being vindictive, not being people who call the cops and become contact tracers against their own neighbors.
[3:02:32.280 --> 3:02:38.280]  So in Wisconsin, the Supreme Court said you can open up, but are you saying that they're not opening up in your county?
[3:02:38.280 --> 3:02:51.280]  Well, no. It's devolved down to the local level, and counties still have the, well, they've taken upon themselves the right to really, really aggressively regulate what we're doing.
[3:02:51.280 --> 3:03:08.280]  Playgrounds are closed down. People are still not going back to work. On the night, actually, of the repeal of the stay-at-home order on the national and on the state level, immediately, tons of bars opened, and people piled into them to celebrate.
[3:03:08.280 --> 3:03:30.280]  And I thought that was neat, actually. But there was such an outcry afterwards, especially in Dane County in Wisconsin, that it became, I mean, it became like you were an absolute animal and a total savage if you were one of these people and shame on you and don't show your face at church anymore.
[3:03:30.280 --> 3:03:43.280]  So those of us who are really committed to liberty as shrinking in our country, I think that's something that shocked me, that there are a lot of folks that are perfectly fine snitching on their neighbors.
[3:03:43.280 --> 3:03:45.280]  They think this is acceptable.
[3:03:45.280 --> 3:04:03.280]  Yeah, no, that is a big cultural shift, but I don't lose hope, because you know what? I think every generation is born with the principles you just outlined. Those five principles are intuitable. They're knowable. The Bible even says they're written on our hearts, because they're based in what's called the natural law.
[3:04:03.280 --> 3:04:30.280]  So you can talk to any person and you can educate them, not in a preachy way, but the word educate actually means to draw out of. It doesn't mean to instill in. So you can talk to your neighbors and you can help them to see what they already know in their gut, that this vindictive, punitive culture that we're seeing form up, especially among young people, is not going to work out well for anyone in the long run.
[3:04:30.280 --> 3:04:47.280]  Well, and I think with this Generation Z, you see a rebellion more than any generation against the shutdown, and they're the ones that have the most to lose. They're the ones that are being told the new normal, less free, less prosperous, less healthy, less secure is going to be the rest of your life.
[3:04:47.280 --> 3:04:55.280]  And I believe, and I hope that they're understanding that they're going to be robbed of this unless they fight back.
[3:04:55.280 --> 3:05:08.280]  That's right. And they need to be told and encouraged. I think they really, what they need to be told is, hey, you're not wrong to feel like there's something very wrong going on here.
[3:05:08.280 --> 3:05:16.280]  You're not wrong to feel uncomfortable with the fact that you're being surveilled by a little piece of machinery in your pocket, that you have zero privacy.
[3:05:16.280 --> 3:05:26.280]  That at any moment somebody could really call the police or something, or the mob. It doesn't matter whether it's the police or the mob. The two are both a form of government in a way.
[3:05:26.280 --> 3:05:36.280]  When somebody sees me not wearing a mask in the grocery store, and they post it on social media, that might actually result in the end of my career.
[3:05:36.280 --> 3:05:42.280]  It could really punish me just as severely as any cop could. So that's something we need to take responsibility for.
[3:05:42.280 --> 3:05:48.280]  And the culture is just as important as what I'm getting at as our form of government.
[3:05:48.280 --> 3:05:55.280]  Well, we had here in Honolulu, our mayor, Kirk Caldwell, when he was asked, how are you going to enforce the mask rule and the social distancing rule?
[3:05:55.280 --> 3:06:03.280]  Are you going to have the police do it? He said, in a press conference, I'm counting on mob justice. I'm counting on mob justice.
[3:06:03.280 --> 3:06:12.280]  When you have a mayor who has the police, people with guns at his disposal, inciting mob violence, this is like dirty.
[3:06:12.280 --> 3:06:17.280]  In the Philippines, where they're shooting people who leave their house.
[3:06:17.280 --> 3:06:20.280]  That's right. And you know what?
[3:06:20.280 --> 3:06:26.280]  Yeah, but we can also take responsibility and realize, you know what? There's an alternative to mob violence and something we can do.
[3:06:26.280 --> 3:06:34.280]  The biggest thing I recommend is business owners who have suffered because of the lockdowns should be suing the authorities who were responsible for what they lost.
[3:06:34.280 --> 3:06:36.280]  And Stephen, are you going to come back?
[3:06:36.280 --> 3:07:01.280]  I want you to talk about suing them right after the break.
[3:07:01.280 --> 3:07:11.280]  So I hope Trump, with his initiatives, can clean this up and fix it. But with the election fraud and the COVID-19, all the wars and the third world collapsing, everything else is going on.
[3:07:11.280 --> 3:07:21.280]  Now is the time to get storeable foods because they'll last for 25 years. They're in easily totable bags. It's high quality food and it's good to have that box checked off to be ready.
[3:07:21.280 --> 3:07:31.280]  And it funds the InfoWars. So we have storeable food available again. InfoWarsStore.com or call toll free, triple A, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[3:07:31.280 --> 3:07:37.280]  But whatever you do, get prepared and get ready because the globalists want you dependent on them. They do not want you to be self-sufficient.
[3:07:37.280 --> 3:08:05.280]  They want you to be self-sufficient right now while you still can.
[3:08:05.280 --> 3:08:09.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the death of the third world and the collapse of the first world.
[3:08:09.280 --> 3:08:15.280]  And this is 21st century warfare carried out by the globalist and they admit they've orchestrated it.
[3:08:15.280 --> 3:08:25.280]  They admit it's good to save the earth and they're teaching us to be more frugal and they want to make us poor so they can dictate our surrender to this post-human technocracy.
[3:08:25.280 --> 3:08:33.280]  I know all this sounds insane when I was talking about it 25 years ago, but now it's public because it's their operations manual.
[3:08:33.280 --> 3:08:43.280]  I wish this wasn't the case, but there really are evil psychopaths in control of most major institutions and we've got to stop them.
[3:08:43.280 --> 3:08:58.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:08:58.280 --> 3:09:03.280]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I am Jason Jones, your guest host and with me is Stephen Herriot.
[3:09:03.280 --> 3:09:11.280]  Stephen, before we get to your strategy to reopen Wisconsin, make sure that our state governments are fearful before they do anything like this again.
[3:09:11.280 --> 3:09:20.280]  I want to put it in perspective. A couple of weeks ago, I was handcuffed and thrown into a police car because I was at a reopen Hawaii event.
[3:09:20.280 --> 3:09:31.280]  In Brazil, we now know the police are cracking down and arresting people and journalists who are supporting the president in his policies to keep Brazil open.
[3:09:31.280 --> 3:09:39.280]  We've seen people in Wisconsin, people in Hong Kong, people in Chinese-occupied East Turkestan, we're going to be talking about those later in the show.
[3:09:39.280 --> 3:09:48.280]  Every corner of the globe, people are suffering because of the commands of distant, unelected bureaucracies.
[3:09:48.280 --> 3:09:54.280]  But if you're in Hong Kong, you can't fight back. If you're in the Kibera slums, you can't fight back.
[3:09:54.280 --> 3:09:58.280]  If you're a journalist in Brazil, it's going to be pretty hard to fight back.
[3:09:58.280 --> 3:10:06.280]  But if you're a small business owner in Honolulu or Wisconsin, we have the ability to fight back and because we can fight back, we must, right?
[3:10:06.280 --> 3:10:10.280]  This is something we have to do. We need to be that city on a hill.
[3:10:10.280 --> 3:10:18.280]  So Stephen, what is it that you're suggesting is the next step for small businesses in this battle to reopen our states?
[3:10:18.280 --> 3:10:27.280]  Yeah, I absolutely agree with what you're saying. The thing that you can do, one thing you can do very easily, surprisingly easily, you might not know this,
[3:10:27.280 --> 3:10:38.280]  is you can find the local officials responsible for the closure of your business and your losses since that closure during the lockdown and you can sue them.
[3:10:38.280 --> 3:10:51.280]  So what you do is you sue your local officials responsible for the lockdown for damages in the probably significant amount of money that you estimate you lost as a result of the shutdown on constitutional grounds,
[3:10:51.280 --> 3:10:55.280]  so with reference particularly to the rights enumerated in the First Amendment.
[3:10:55.280 --> 3:11:00.280]  Now, you've got to remember, the Constitution is a legal document, right?
[3:11:00.280 --> 3:11:10.280]  So this will be a real pushback, a really substantial pushback in my opinion against the officials responsible for this and the important thing about it is you're sending a message to them
[3:11:10.280 --> 3:11:16.280]  and it's going to also dissipate throughout the culture that, don't you ever try this again?
[3:11:16.280 --> 3:11:26.280]  Now, big important point, you don't have to win. I'm not saying win your money back, right? You might just be out of luck there.
[3:11:26.280 --> 3:11:38.280]  I'm saying file. So imagine if 75 businesses, right, each of which it took the owners to build up, took the owners some 10, 15, 20 years to build up,
[3:11:38.280 --> 3:11:43.280]  they could easily be suing, I mean, they sunk how many millions of dollars into that out of their own pocket over the years?
[3:11:43.280 --> 3:11:49.280]  They could easily each be suing for 5 to 10 million dollars, right? Probably more.
[3:11:49.280 --> 3:12:02.280]  So if you imagine 75 businesses in a small county suddenly filing suit and this would go onto the same desk and this one official or these few officials are going to look at those documents
[3:12:02.280 --> 3:12:09.280]  and they're going to back the heck down. It's going to scare them because they realize, oh, these people are serious.
[3:12:09.280 --> 3:12:12.280]  And they're not going to try this again.
[3:12:12.280 --> 3:12:21.280]  Never again. But I was a boy, I grew up in a rough neighborhood. And in the third grade, by the third grade, I realized if anyone called me a name,
[3:12:21.280 --> 3:12:27.280]  tried to pick on me, I fought them every time. Didn't mean I had to win. Like you said, you didn't have to win.
[3:12:27.280 --> 3:12:33.280]  But people learn one joke at this kid's expense, you're in a fight. People don't want to get in fights all day.
[3:12:33.280 --> 3:12:43.280]  So then they leave you alone. And I know here in Honolulu, we're gathering businesses, we are suing, I'm suing already the mayor, the governor, the chief of police and the attorney general.
[3:12:43.280 --> 3:12:49.280]  And if all of us do this, if your business has been impacted, you have to fight back.
[3:12:49.280 --> 3:12:59.280]  And later on in the show, we're having a gentleman from Chinese-occupied East Turkestan to talk about what's happening in Hong Kong and what's happening in East Turkestan.
[3:12:59.280 --> 3:13:13.280]  We're going to have a friend of mine who's a filmmaker from Brazil talking about the crackdown and the persecution of journalists that are trying to communicate the truth against this global homogenous world states, dictates in Brazil.
[3:13:13.280 --> 3:13:24.280]  They have a harder time fighting back. You know, when I was being handcuffed, people joked that I was smiling. And as I was being put in the car, I said to my wife, do you have the car keys?
[3:13:24.280 --> 3:13:34.280]  Well, I knew that I was safe. Unlike that poor man in Minneapolis, I knew that in broad daylight with all these cameras around, I was going to be okay.
[3:13:34.280 --> 3:13:40.280]  Although the two people they arrested with me, they kept in the car until they had heat stroke, which was a bit disconcerting.
[3:13:40.280 --> 3:13:45.280]  But I knew relatively, I was relatively safe. I had nothing to worry about.
[3:13:45.280 --> 3:13:54.280]  When you're a small business owner, the inconvenience of this lawsuit is such a small thing, but we are privileged with the ability to fight back, so we must fight back.
[3:13:54.280 --> 3:14:02.280]  That's right. I think a big element here is that people have a misunderstanding of what fear is. Fear has a purpose, right? It's one of our passions.
[3:14:02.280 --> 3:14:09.280]  It's something given to us by God, built into our nature. And it should be governed by the virtue of prudence, right? You fear the...
[3:14:09.280 --> 3:14:20.280]  It's not that you shouldn't have any fear. It's that you should fear the right things, right? So, for example, you're so fearful of hell that you are willing to die rather than sin gravely or something like that.
[3:14:20.280 --> 3:14:28.280]  Well, similarly, we should be more afraid of the consequences of these lockdowns going unanswered and uncomplained against.
[3:14:28.280 --> 3:14:38.280]  We should be far more afraid of that and the effect it will have on the posterity of our country and the future of our country than we are of getting arrested.
[3:14:38.280 --> 3:14:53.280]  Getting arrested is not nearly as fearful as consigning all future generations into a merciless slave state. So, get your priorities straight. Yes, you should fear, but you should fear the right things.
[3:14:53.280 --> 3:15:03.280]  Yeah, fear being ignoble. I tell my children that the future is concentration camps. I want nothing but a world of concentration camps.
[3:15:03.280 --> 3:15:18.280]  I would prefer my posterity be in them than guarding them. We have to be noble, but it's up to us to make sure we don't have the slave camp future like they have in Chinese-occupied East Turkistan today, like it's being put in place in Hong Kong as we speak.
[3:15:18.280 --> 3:15:24.280]  And we shouldn't take this for granted. Stephen, how many more... Are you still doing events?
[3:15:24.280 --> 3:15:37.280]  We're looking at putting together a second wave. We've tested the lockdown, the lockdown was rescinded, and yeah, there's much more to be done for sure.
[3:15:37.280 --> 3:15:52.280]  Houston Lombard is a local activist here. I've been learning a lot from her. She's local here and she's just been terrific. I'm more her disciple. I'm her apprentice and following her lead in a lot of ways since she's terrific. She's a libertarian activist here.
[3:15:52.280 --> 3:15:58.280]  Are you signaling to your local sheriff to arrest her or not you? That's what I'm getting at.
[3:15:58.280 --> 3:16:02.280]  Yeah, because you know what? I've got things to do.
[3:16:02.280 --> 3:16:15.280]  Yeah, I just... The gyms are opening up again. So, Stephen, as we are fighting to reopen our businesses here at home, we're seeing a crackdown in Hong Kong.
[3:16:15.280 --> 3:16:23.280]  And what's also disconcerting is how the media is covering Hong Kong and East Turkestan as if it's sort of ancillary.
[3:16:23.280 --> 3:16:30.280]  If it's not a big deal or if it's just... Have you noticed the strange coverage of what's happening in Hong Kong?
[3:16:30.280 --> 3:16:40.280]  I've noticed a lot of strange coverage. There's a total lack of balance in the coverage of everything. In other words, there's no consistency.
[3:16:40.280 --> 3:16:49.280]  There's no single principle that they can apply to each situation. Every single situation is just an opportunity to take advantage of it and use it to promote an agenda.
[3:16:49.280 --> 3:16:57.280]  It's a vast trump. I was watching CNN yesterday, which is something I normally don't do. And I recommend doing it maybe once a month just to remind yourself.
[3:16:57.280 --> 3:17:05.280]  I was watching Don Lemon to remind yourself that this is not media. This is not news. This is pure propaganda.
[3:17:05.280 --> 3:17:13.280]  And like you said, everything is taken as an opportunity to propagandize and advance an agenda that they never are interested in getting at the truth.
[3:17:13.280 --> 3:17:25.280]  Well, and God help the... I mean, the poor man in Minneapolis who died was a security guard, an upstanding citizen, totally ordinary guy, and look what he's being used for.
[3:17:25.280 --> 3:17:27.280]  Just abominable.
[3:17:27.280 --> 3:17:37.280]  It's tragic. Well, coming up after this break, we're going to have Arslan Hudaia, who's from Chinese Occupities, Turkestan, to tell us the truth about what's happening now in China and their occupied territories.
[3:17:57.280 --> 3:18:01.280]  Inside that list of 10, you'll be permanently detained.
[3:18:01.280 --> 3:18:13.280]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this is the New World Order, where they let the criminals out of jail, the rapists, the child molesters, the murderers, and where you are now non-essential and a prisoner.
[3:18:13.280 --> 3:18:18.280]  From the beginning of my research, it was clear the globalists are an authoritarian anti-human group.
[3:18:18.280 --> 3:18:25.280]  They have to put this electronic straightjacket on us before they carry out their end game, which is global depopulation.
[3:18:25.280 --> 3:18:29.280]  So you see, submitting to them is death.
[3:18:29.280 --> 3:18:56.280]  The only way to stop them is to expose them, to hate their guts, and realize they are humanity's mortal enemy. Wake up or die.
[3:18:59.280 --> 3:19:03.280]  Take one pill about an hour before I want to go to bed, and boom, I get a great night's sleep.
[3:19:03.280 --> 3:19:09.280]  And just this past Memorial Day, I took two of them, fell asleep about 1 a.m., woke up at 8 a.m., ready to go.
[3:19:09.280 --> 3:19:13.280]  It really has made a difference in my life, and it can make a difference in your life, too.
[3:19:13.280 --> 3:19:15.280]  If you don't get any sleep, you're going to be a grouch.
[3:19:15.280 --> 3:19:17.280]  If you get great sleep, you're going to be on point.
[3:19:17.280 --> 3:19:21.280]  You're going to be mentally focused. You're going to be ready to take on the day.
[3:19:21.280 --> 3:19:26.280]  And right now, knockout is 50% off. It's less than $15 a bottle. You get 30 capsules.
[3:19:26.280 --> 3:19:33.280]  Give it a try today. It's at a great price right now, and it can really help you get the sleep you need, especially in these tough times.
[3:19:33.280 --> 3:19:57.280]  It's knockout, and it's available at InfowarsStore.com.
[3:20:03.280 --> 3:20:09.280]  It's the spray cap. It doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick, gross, gooo.
[3:20:09.280 --> 3:20:13.280]  But it's high quality. It aerosolizes it in a really great way.
[3:20:13.280 --> 3:20:16.280]  I like to put it on my hands, rub a little bit on my face.
[3:20:16.280 --> 3:20:19.280]  It's got organic alcohol in it, so spray it around your eyes.
[3:20:19.280 --> 3:20:23.280]  But I just love it, personally, as something that's a moisturizer as well.
[3:20:23.280 --> 3:20:25.280]  So, this is a real innovation.
[3:20:25.280 --> 3:20:30.280]  I don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer that actually has essential oil in it,
[3:20:30.280 --> 3:20:36.280]  so it doesn't dry you out. It smells great. It's so refreshing. This is a big winner.
[3:21:01.280 --> 3:21:06.280]  I am also the host of the Jason Jones show, and thanks to the Infowar audience,
[3:21:06.280 --> 3:21:11.280]  in the past couple of weeks, we've cracked the top 100 podcasts on chartables.
[3:21:11.280 --> 3:21:15.280]  So, go on over, subscribe, give us five stars, and write a review.
[3:21:15.280 --> 3:21:19.280]  I really appreciate you guys coming to the show and helping us grow.
[3:21:19.280 --> 3:21:25.280]  And one of the things we do on the show is cover those stories that the mainstream media fails to cover.
[3:21:25.280 --> 3:21:32.280]  And for years now, I've been writing about and covering in detail the plight of the Uyghur and Chinese-occupied East Turkestan.
[3:21:32.280 --> 3:21:37.280]  And I want to commend our Congress, because they've run ahead of the media,
[3:21:37.280 --> 3:21:42.280]  and they put on the president's desk a bill, the Uyghur Human Rights Bill,
[3:21:42.280 --> 3:21:51.280]  and Arsalan Hudaia is, from the other side of the world, is joining us on Infowars to give us an up-to-date report on
[3:21:51.280 --> 3:21:55.280]  what's happening with the Uyghur during the shutdown, what is this bill going to mean,
[3:21:55.280 --> 3:21:59.280]  and we know the president's going to sign it. He's been a leading advocate for the Uyghur.
[3:21:59.280 --> 3:22:08.280]  And Arsalan, what's strange is the media usually leads a campaign and then the politicians follow behind.
[3:22:08.280 --> 3:22:13.280]  But when it's come to the Uyghur, Congress is ahead of the mainstream media.
[3:22:13.280 --> 3:22:15.280]  Welcome to the show.
[3:22:15.280 --> 3:22:18.280]  Thank you. Thank you so much for having me, Jason.
[3:22:18.280 --> 3:22:21.280]  Well, as you said, Congress has really stepped up.
[3:22:21.280 --> 3:22:24.280]  They've realized that this is not just for show.
[3:22:24.280 --> 3:22:30.280]  The media hasn't been covering this, as you've mentioned, and like the Alex Jones show,
[3:22:30.280 --> 3:22:32.280]  like your show, has been covering this.
[3:22:32.280 --> 3:22:38.280]  It's really, to an extent, sickening that it's not getting the attention that it deserves.
[3:22:38.280 --> 3:22:44.280]  So this legislation that you're talking about will constantly update U.S. policy towards China
[3:22:44.280 --> 3:22:48.280]  to address the human rights happening in Chinese-occupied East Turkestan.
[3:22:48.280 --> 3:22:54.280]  It will direct President Trump or whoever is president, regardless of whether they're right or left,
[3:22:54.280 --> 3:23:00.280]  when it does come to pass, and it will make the president impose visa bans and financial sanctions
[3:23:00.280 --> 3:23:05.280]  on those Chinese officials who are directly responsible for the atrocities against the Uyghurs
[3:23:05.280 --> 3:23:09.280]  under the provisions of the Global Menitsky Act.
[3:23:09.280 --> 3:23:12.280]  So this is a great move, yeah.
[3:23:12.280 --> 3:23:17.280]  Well, Arsalan, many people aren't even aware of what's happening in Chinese-occupied East Turkestan
[3:23:17.280 --> 3:23:19.280]  because our media fails to cover it.
[3:23:19.280 --> 3:23:23.280]  What are those atrocities that Congress has been responding to?
[3:23:23.280 --> 3:23:27.280]  Well, very shortly, very quickly, it's the worst human rights violation
[3:23:27.280 --> 3:23:31.280]  happened to an ethno-religious group since World War II, since the Holocaust.
[3:23:31.280 --> 3:23:35.280]  So I've gone out on social media and said, I've called this the Uyghur Holocaust,
[3:23:35.280 --> 3:23:37.280]  and that's how we should be treating it.
[3:23:37.280 --> 3:23:41.280]  There are upwards of a thousand camps, perhaps even more,
[3:23:41.280 --> 3:23:46.280]  and in these camps, according to one detainee who stayed there for three months,
[3:23:46.280 --> 3:23:50.280]  she witnessed nine people die in a three-month period.
[3:23:50.280 --> 3:23:53.280]  And according to the U.S. State Department,
[3:23:53.280 --> 3:23:57.280]  somewhere around two to three million people in these camps.
[3:23:57.280 --> 3:23:59.280]  So we can only imagine the number of deaths.
[3:23:59.280 --> 3:24:02.280]  It's not simply a cultural genocide, like everyone's saying.
[3:24:02.280 --> 3:24:07.280]  There's a physical genocide that is happening, and people are being slaughtered en masse.
[3:24:07.280 --> 3:24:12.280]  But because China is such a sophisticated, economically-powered,
[3:24:12.280 --> 3:24:17.280]  with their AI surveillance state, they are able to keep these things under wraps,
[3:24:17.280 --> 3:24:22.280]  not letting journalists in, not letting foreign investigators in.
[3:24:22.280 --> 3:24:26.280]  And people need to wake up to this because eventually it will reach their doorsteps,
[3:24:26.280 --> 3:24:28.280]  and in a way, it has with the virus.
[3:24:28.280 --> 3:24:34.280]  We can just see the way that the CCP has controlled the narrative of the Chinese virus
[3:24:34.280 --> 3:24:37.280]  and the amount of people that have died in the United States.
[3:24:37.280 --> 3:24:39.280]  It's surpassed 100,000.
[3:24:39.280 --> 3:24:45.280]  So in a way, people need to wake up to the CCP, the common enemy of all of us,
[3:24:45.280 --> 3:24:48.280]  regardless whether you're on the left or on the right.
[3:24:48.280 --> 3:24:53.280]  People all over the world are locked in their homes because of the dishonesty of the CCP.
[3:24:53.280 --> 3:24:57.280]  What they started in East Turkestan, they're continuing to do now in Hong Kong.
[3:24:57.280 --> 3:25:00.280]  We should look to see more aggression against Taiwan.
[3:25:00.280 --> 3:25:05.280]  And, you know, they came for the Uyghur first. That's what they're going to say 100 years from now.
[3:25:05.280 --> 3:25:07.280]  And we said nothing.
[3:25:07.280 --> 3:25:12.280]  Now that we see Congress stepping up, does this give you hope?
[3:25:12.280 --> 3:25:17.280]  I do. I hope others do follow the world.
[3:25:17.280 --> 3:25:24.280]  And these countries that claim to champion human rights do follow in the footsteps of President Donald Trump,
[3:25:24.280 --> 3:25:30.280]  regardless of any sort of personal thing that some of these countries that may have him,
[3:25:30.280 --> 3:25:36.280]  he is doing the right thing or the Republicans are doing the right thing in this manner.
[3:25:36.280 --> 3:25:38.280]  And people need to step up.
[3:25:38.280 --> 3:25:44.280]  And you can talk all day about protecting the people and speaking for the voiceless.
[3:25:44.280 --> 3:25:48.280]  But if you're not actually doing it, then it's all lip service.
[3:25:48.280 --> 3:25:55.280]  Yeah, no, it's really strange now how we're all connected, how we in the United States have taken our liberty for granted.
[3:25:55.280 --> 3:26:01.280]  But, Arsalan, this might sound strange to you, but when I was at the Reopen Hawaii event in my state,
[3:26:01.280 --> 3:26:05.280]  it was more for the people of Hong Kong, more for the people of East Turkestan,
[3:26:05.280 --> 3:26:13.280]  more for the people in the Horn of Africa, because they're the ones that are really suffering from this WHO CCP global shutdown.
[3:26:13.280 --> 3:26:20.280]  And now that we see Congress moving in the midst of this, it's very hopeful. I know the president has signaled he's going to sign it.
[3:26:20.280 --> 3:26:23.280]  Do you know what day that you expect him to sign it?
[3:26:23.280 --> 3:26:27.280]  No, I'm not sure exactly what day he'll actually end up signing it.
[3:26:27.280 --> 3:26:38.280]  But according to US law, as long as he doesn't veto it, this law should automatically come into play in the next 10 days.
[3:26:38.280 --> 3:26:47.280]  So we are hopeful that he won't veto it, because it's been pretty much almost unanimous, both in the Senate and in the House of Representatives.
[3:26:47.280 --> 3:26:57.280]  So it's a matter of actually, I look forward to the future where this is actually put into and implemented, put into place and implemented.
[3:26:57.280 --> 3:27:04.280]  Well, he signaled in a press conference two days ago that he had a surprise for the Uyghur, and he said they're going to be very, very, very, very happy.
[3:27:04.280 --> 3:27:08.280]  So that makes me think he's going to want to sign it and speak on it.
[3:27:08.280 --> 3:27:14.280]  I know Pompeo made a very brave speech several months ago where he called on China to close the camps.
[3:27:14.280 --> 3:27:18.280]  Ambassador Brownback, the president's ambassador at large on religious liberty.
[3:27:18.280 --> 3:27:28.280]  You know, when he flew to China last year, his first words when he got off the plane, he says, China has declared a war on religion and China will lose.
[3:27:28.280 --> 3:27:36.280]  And he also spoke up personally on behalf of the Uyghur. And then for the rest of Ambassador Brownback's events, no one showed up.
[3:27:36.280 --> 3:27:41.280]  So he just flew to Taiwan. I appreciate his spirit.
[3:27:41.280 --> 3:27:52.280]  What can we do? Those of us sitting in our homes, you know, I still find a lot of my friends, my neighbors, people in my church have never even heard the word Uyghur.
[3:27:52.280 --> 3:28:03.280]  What is it that we can do to help bring awareness to the plight of, like, as you said, it's the greatest cultural genocide and real genocide since the Holocaust?
[3:28:03.280 --> 3:28:09.280]  I would say get educated. Google the word Uyghur. Who are they?
[3:28:09.280 --> 3:28:20.280]  Are they who the Chinese government or the Chinese regime say they are? Are they really these dangerous people that are set to, you know, destroy the lives of many?
[3:28:20.280 --> 3:28:25.280]  So I would say educate yourself. Once you've educated yourself, educate others.
[3:28:25.280 --> 3:28:30.280]  I mean, we have this amazing tool, social media. Get on Twitter. Get on Facebook.
[3:28:30.280 --> 3:28:35.280]  Follow the work that I do. Follow the work that my Facebook page, Talk to East Turkestandas. Get educated.
[3:28:35.280 --> 3:28:46.280]  And because there is so much Chinese propaganda, soft power of Chinese propaganda happening in your own American universities, in your own American newspapers,
[3:28:46.280 --> 3:28:56.280]  they are able to China Daily, People's Daily Global Times. They are allowed to print articles in your own American newspapers.
[3:28:56.280 --> 3:29:05.280]  So against this narrative of lies, people need to find the truth that they should follow your podcast.
[3:29:05.280 --> 3:29:13.280]  Find out what's happening on InfoWars, on the Alex Jones show. Get educated and don't be deceived by Chinese Communist lies.
[3:29:13.280 --> 3:29:18.280]  This is Cold War 2 in the making. We're probably already in the midst of the Cold War.
[3:29:18.280 --> 3:29:24.280]  And hopefully the United States, the free world, the voiceless come out on top.
[3:29:24.280 --> 3:29:31.280]  You know, you have to be relentless. I on social media, I've shared articles from like the Economist on the plight of the Uyghur.
[3:29:31.280 --> 3:29:35.280]  And it's been removed from Facebook for violating community standards.
[3:29:35.280 --> 3:29:43.280]  So I'm not only hopeful that Congress has got this bill on the president's desk. I'm excited about the president's war with Twitter.
[3:29:43.280 --> 3:29:53.280]  Joe Rogan moving from YouTube to Spotify. I'm hoping some of these moves open up and they soften their censorship so we can begin to communicate.
[3:29:53.280 --> 3:30:03.280]  Have you found that the big companies like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube have been blocking accurate information on what's happening in East Turkestan?
[3:30:03.280 --> 3:30:08.280]  Yes, so especially on our talk to East Turkestan page, we have been shadow banned.
[3:30:08.280 --> 3:30:16.280]  So there will be periods throughout the year, normally when we share something where we get thousands of views or thousands of shares,
[3:30:16.280 --> 3:30:22.280]  but suddenly we'll only get tens of shares and we realize that Facebook does this, Twitter does this as well.
[3:30:22.280 --> 3:30:29.280]  And we recently found that many of my friends who are Uyghur activists have been having their accounts blocked or temporary events.
[3:30:29.280 --> 3:30:36.280]  So please follow me. Exactly. Follow this and share the news.
[3:30:36.280 --> 3:30:40.280]  Memorial Day is here. It's one of the biggest sales of the year.
[3:30:40.280 --> 3:30:45.280]  And we were already running a huge sale, but we're having to end that one because a bunch of items are selling out.
[3:30:45.280 --> 3:30:51.280]  But all the items we have left in stock are still on record sale and then five items that weren't on sale we got back in stock.
[3:30:51.280 --> 3:30:55.280]  They're also massively discounted as well for the Memorial Day special.
[3:30:55.280 --> 3:30:59.280]  So here it is, super male vitality, 40% off.
[3:30:59.280 --> 3:31:01.280]  Knockout, the great sleeping, 50% off.
[3:31:01.280 --> 3:31:03.280]  Brain Force Plus hadn't been on sale for almost six months.
[3:31:03.280 --> 3:31:05.280]  It is 50% off.
[3:31:05.280 --> 3:31:08.280]  Bio Jerusalemium, 60% off.
[3:31:08.280 --> 3:31:11.280]  Shell Forge, it's incredible, 60% off.
[3:31:11.280 --> 3:31:15.280]  And you've got all these other items on sale as well until they sell out.
[3:31:15.280 --> 3:31:23.280]  So infowarstore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine to get these items to take advantage of this mega sale Memorial Day.
[3:31:23.280 --> 3:31:25.280]  Again, thank you all for watching.
[3:31:25.280 --> 3:31:32.280]  We appreciate your support, your financial support, but it's also supported you and your family with amazing products that are so good for you and your body.
[3:31:32.280 --> 3:31:54.280]  Again, thank you all for your support. We are all in this together.
[3:32:02.280 --> 3:32:06.280]  Nonsense for about 60 seconds and then just fell over dead.
[3:32:06.280 --> 3:32:08.280]  Well, that's what's going to happen with our economy.
[3:32:08.280 --> 3:32:10.280]  It is in cardiac arrest.
[3:32:10.280 --> 3:32:18.280]  This has been done by design and the UN, the Chi Coms, the mainstream media orchestrated it, hyped it and tried to keep the economy closed.
[3:32:18.280 --> 3:32:29.280]  So remember, the depression that's coming and the third world collapse is all on the UN, on Bill and Melinda Gates, on Obama, on Hillary, on Biden, on the Democrats.
[3:32:29.280 --> 3:32:37.280]  We tried to stop it, we tried to fight it, but you guys said you wanted to wreck America and the world and now you've done it. Congratulations.
[3:32:37.280 --> 3:32:42.280]  We are 170 days out from the 2020 election.
[3:32:42.280 --> 3:32:46.280]  It is a referendum of national sovereignty against localism.
[3:32:46.280 --> 3:32:56.280]  And Obama, Hillary and the deep state have been caught attempting to overthrow President Trump's election and they've been caught in two separate coup attempts against the president.
[3:32:56.280 --> 3:33:04.280]  Now they've been pushing COVID-19 to shut down the economy and create a depression while China has already been open for business for more than a month.
[3:33:04.280 --> 3:33:16.280]  This is an ongoing globalist attempt to punish the American people, wreck our economy and hope that we won't recognize that it is they, the new world order, that have orchestrated this and not President Trump.
[3:33:16.280 --> 3:33:20.280]  They know their crimes are coming out. They know the chickens are coming home to roost.
[3:33:20.280 --> 3:33:29.280]  So now they're panicking and trying to steal the 2020 election with mail-in ballots based on keeping the public safe from COVID-19.
[3:33:29.280 --> 3:33:55.280]  The entire COVID-19 system is a giant hoax and must be exposed if America has any hope. So get out there and expose this fraud.
[3:33:55.280 --> 3:34:03.280]  Rachel, we are shutting your ass down. Yeah, we told you don't be farmers and don't be ranchers and don't work in industry anymore.
[3:34:03.280 --> 3:34:10.280]  You're going to be the service economy. And now the globalists are telling you that there's no more service economy and you're obsolete.
[3:34:10.280 --> 3:34:16.280]  So you better bow down to them and get your universal pittance income so they can dictate your life.
[3:34:16.280 --> 3:34:21.280]  The handcuffs are going on right now. We have to resist and say no to the new world order.
[3:34:21.280 --> 3:34:30.280]  And that takes you understanding you were right and understanding I was right and getting in people's faces and raising the alarm now while you still can.
[3:34:30.280 --> 3:34:54.280]  Now is the time for action. Now is the time for you to shine and be the Paul Revere's you know you are.
[3:34:54.280 --> 3:35:00.280]  Welcome back to our for the Alex Jones show. I'm your guest host Jason Jones coming to you from the great state of Hawaii.
[3:35:00.280 --> 3:35:03.280]  And pretty soon I hope you'll be able to visit us again.
[3:35:03.280 --> 3:35:12.280]  But we do have a nitwit leftist governor as Tucker Carlson referred to our governor Governor E gay as last night we have the least.
[3:35:12.280 --> 3:35:24.280]  COVID deaths actually zero COVID deaths I think less than 20 COVID related deaths but the most draconian shutdown and we're approaching 35% unemployment but I hope someday soon you can come and visit us.
[3:35:24.280 --> 3:35:30.280]  We're going to need everyone we can to come back and help us rebuild our economy.
[3:35:30.280 --> 3:35:37.280]  What I love about the privilege of guest hosting this show is that this is a global influential audience.
[3:35:37.280 --> 3:35:52.280]  So to be able to bring on Arsalan to speak for the Uighur who have had no voice through the mainstream media on to this show and speak to this huge audience this influential audience is a privilege when a friend of mine who is a documentary filmmaker from
[3:35:52.280 --> 3:36:07.280]  Brazil contacted me yesterday and was telling me about how fearful it is for people in Brazil to show public signs of support for their president of our Bolsonaro how afraid journalists are for accurately covering the story.
[3:36:07.280 --> 3:36:14.280]  In Brazil it doesn't toe the WTO line journalists are for have literal fear for their life.
[3:36:14.280 --> 3:36:20.280]  I said good oh you got to come on the Alex Jones show and share what's happening in Brazil with the world.
[3:36:20.280 --> 3:36:22.280]  Welcome to the show.
[3:36:22.280 --> 3:36:25.280]  Hey Jason.
[3:36:25.280 --> 3:36:26.280]  How are you doing.
[3:36:26.280 --> 3:36:28.280]  Can you hear me.
[3:36:28.280 --> 3:36:30.280]  Yeah I'm hearing you.
[3:36:30.280 --> 3:36:31.280]  Are you.
[3:36:31.280 --> 3:36:32.280]  I'm hearing you.
[3:36:32.280 --> 3:36:33.280]  You hear me.
[3:36:33.280 --> 3:36:35.280]  I can hear you perfect.
[3:36:35.280 --> 3:36:39.280]  So what happened in Brazil and what what what is the fear.
[3:36:39.280 --> 3:36:41.280]  Why do journalists have fear.
[3:36:41.280 --> 3:36:44.280]  Why is fear been instilled in them.
[3:36:44.280 --> 3:36:55.280]  I'm living as you know we met last time in January and I'm living in Italy I'm living in Europe's less 10 years.
[3:36:55.280 --> 3:37:12.280]  And even though I'm in contact with Brazil all this time through through the work as an artist I'm a musician and I I'm producing my first documentary as you said.
[3:37:12.280 --> 3:37:18.280]  And well the thing is I was I was here in contact with some friends in Brazil yesterday.
[3:37:18.280 --> 3:37:27.280]  And then I just read that a friend of mine I worked I was working with him in a project in Rome in October.
[3:37:27.280 --> 3:37:40.280]  He said you know the federal police they just came to to my place today and they took my my computer and my mobile and everything.
[3:37:40.280 --> 3:37:45.280]  So I was completely surprised about that.
[3:37:45.280 --> 3:37:56.280]  And actually yesterday the the highest court of the Republic the Supreme Federal Court actually in a very unexpected movement.
[3:37:56.280 --> 3:38:15.280]  They they brought out an inquire the number four seven eight one and days they search and they make search and size or warrants in the residents of 29 people in Brazil between journalists.
[3:38:15.280 --> 3:38:28.280]  Businessmen and everyone of every this 29 people they were somehow connected to a public support of President Bolsonaro.
[3:38:28.280 --> 3:38:38.280]  So it's something very is is is you know it's reminiscent of what it's reminiscent of what happened here to Roger Stone.
[3:38:38.280 --> 3:38:46.280]  It's hard to believe that people could be persecuted because of their friendship with the president.
[3:38:46.280 --> 3:38:57.280]  And then we see this happen in Brazil it's because and where is the power and influence coming from inside of Brazil to arrest journalists to raid their homes.
[3:38:57.280 --> 3:38:59.280]  It's coming from globalists.
[3:38:59.280 --> 3:39:08.280]  A very powerful we've already seen what Soros has done to Brazil by the way he has a long history of being very savage to Brazil.
[3:39:08.280 --> 3:39:20.280]  So we see the globalists their influence in the courts and how if you are trying to report accurately because the covert narrative for Brazil is part of the global scare tactic right.
[3:39:20.280 --> 3:39:31.280]  They have to control Bolsonaro wanted to keep his country open and didn't follow the draconian suggestions from WTO.
[3:39:31.280 --> 3:39:34.280]  So now he needs to be the example.
[3:39:34.280 --> 3:39:36.280]  So those narratives have to be consistent.
[3:39:36.280 --> 3:39:48.280]  So any journalist trying to get accurate reports accurate numbers you're saying is now finding their homes raided and the court upheld those seizures.
[3:39:48.280 --> 3:39:50.280]  Yeah exactly.
[3:39:50.280 --> 3:40:00.280]  So for instance in and you know there's a channel in Brazil called the salivary that came out actually even before Bolsonaro was elected.
[3:40:00.280 --> 3:40:06.280]  It's a conservative channel independent and they have like millions of followers.
[3:40:06.280 --> 3:40:14.280]  And when just to explain yesterday when they were doing a live you know talking about what happened yesterday.
[3:40:14.280 --> 3:40:20.280]  They had like 10 more audience than CNN in Brazil.
[3:40:20.280 --> 3:40:21.280]  It's huge.
[3:40:21.280 --> 3:40:26.280]  The independent media in Brazil is is is growing.
[3:40:26.280 --> 3:40:29.280]  And just to understand how bad was yesterday.
[3:40:29.280 --> 3:40:36.280]  Alando Santos he is living in he lives in in Brasilia the capital of Brazil right now.
[3:40:36.280 --> 3:40:46.280]  You rent a place where he lives where he works and everything you know he's his channel is growing but he's working really hard.
[3:40:46.280 --> 3:40:52.280]  You know how is it working as an independent journalist or a filmmaker and so on.
[3:40:52.280 --> 3:41:00.280]  But Alando Santos has two kids and his wife is pregnant in the nine month right.
[3:41:00.280 --> 3:41:06.280]  And the police came with the guns into his house.
[3:41:06.280 --> 3:41:08.280]  You know.
[3:41:08.280 --> 3:41:12.280]  So this is this is a global French Revolution.
[3:41:12.280 --> 3:41:16.280]  So from Italy to Brazil to East Turkistan.
[3:41:16.280 --> 3:41:25.280]  This is as Alex was saying for over 20 30 years now that there's a one for a minds that this is a prison planet.
[3:41:25.280 --> 3:41:30.280]  We are we now officially live in a prison planet.
[3:41:30.280 --> 3:41:33.280]  I think it's fair to say this is now a prison planet.
[3:41:33.280 --> 3:41:38.280]  And the reason I wanted you to have to have you on is I wanted people to know what's going on in Brazil.
[3:41:38.280 --> 3:41:43.280]  But to inspire Americans because we are of everyone in the planet Earth.
[3:41:43.280 --> 3:41:47.280]  We are the ones that are in the best position to fight back.
[3:41:47.280 --> 3:41:48.280]  You know great.
[3:41:48.280 --> 3:41:52.280]  Thanks be to God we have info wars and we have alternative media.
[3:41:52.280 --> 3:41:59.280]  Info wars in Brazil is there alternative media trying to tell the truth in Portuguese about what's happening.
[3:41:59.280 --> 3:42:00.280]  Absolutely.
[3:42:00.280 --> 3:42:04.280]  With this new world over with this new order there is.
[3:42:04.280 --> 3:42:05.280]  Yeah absolutely.
[3:42:05.280 --> 3:42:14.280]  Well I was telling talking about Alando Santos that it's they really they're all day long with with.
[3:42:14.280 --> 3:42:27.280]  I think Alan actually met Alex Alex Jones personally last year's I guess but there is one of the roots of this.
[3:42:27.280 --> 3:42:39.280]  Let's say let's call revolution this in Brazil of this answer to the liberals and to this new new order.
[3:42:39.280 --> 3:42:45.280]  It's a philosopher from Brazil that lives in the U.S. Olavo de Carvalho.
[3:42:45.280 --> 3:42:56.280]  He lives he's living in the U.S. actually one of the reasons is because he has much more freedom to criticize his living in the U.S.
[3:42:56.280 --> 3:43:04.280]  since the government of Lula and he has much more freedom to criticize the government living outside Brazil.
[3:43:04.280 --> 3:43:20.280]  Because probably Olavo de Carvalho is great philosopher if he was if he lives in Brazil he would live in Brazil right now he probably would be you know has one of these 29 people he would be one of those you know.
[3:43:20.280 --> 3:43:33.280]  And I think it's really important you talked about you know this connection I'm living in Europe here but I just to to understand how this is not new in Brazil.
[3:43:33.280 --> 3:43:43.280]  So when I compose the music for a documentary about Olavo de Carvalho about this philosopher like four years ago or five years ago.
[3:43:43.280 --> 3:43:52.280]  And since the moment I was connected you know I'm an artist first of all and I was connect my name was connected to his name.
[3:43:52.280 --> 3:44:05.280]  So I just to explain I lost a lot of jobs there you know I lost a lot of jobs in Brazil because they connected my name to to to a guy that that is conservative.
[3:44:05.280 --> 3:44:19.280]  So well and well yeah well that's why I wanted to have you on you know we have just about a minute left because from Hong Kong to East Turkestan to people who now are not a lot of farm across the Middle East in India in Africa.
[3:44:19.280 --> 3:44:31.280]  They're going to starve to death. Both scenario has been fighting for his people food insecurity is a real problem has been a real problem in Brazil famine is something that they would really have to worry about not covid.
[3:44:31.280 --> 3:44:41.280]  So to have a president who's resisting this globalist homogenized state and to find that even Brazilians in Brazil can't defend their own president.
[3:44:41.280 --> 3:44:49.280]  Guto I want to thank you for being on the air because that one I wanted that to be the message of this show today guys is thank you.
[3:44:49.280 --> 3:44:57.280]  This is this is a new normal. This is a new normal. We're being fatigued. We're being maybe load a little bit to sleep. We're being rope adult.
[3:44:57.280 --> 3:45:03.280]  We need to stand up. We need to reopen our economy. We need to fight for our free speech.
[3:45:03.280 --> 3:45:13.280]  We need to get the stories out there that the media are censoring like what's happening in the courts in Brazil like what's happening in the streets in Hong Kong or in Minneapolis.
[3:45:13.280 --> 3:45:22.280]  And we need to promote the incomparable dignity human person the law above the laws of man and we need to kick distant unelected bureaucracies out of our communities.
[3:45:22.280 --> 3:45:34.280]  From Hawaii, Jason Jones. Hello. Thanks Guto.
