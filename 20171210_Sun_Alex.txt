[00:00.000 --> 00:16.640]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well
[00:16.640 --> 00:24.800]  so does he live from the Infowars.com studios it's Alex Jones
[00:24.800 --> 00:34.160]  welcome to the Alex Jones show it is Sunday December the 10th 2017 I'm David Knight I'm your
[00:34.160 --> 00:39.680]  host today usually you'll find me at 8 a.m. Monday through Friday but today I'm here on the Sunday
[00:39.680 --> 00:46.320]  show and we have an amazing sequence of events over the last couple of days one of them you
[00:46.320 --> 00:51.840]  probably haven't heard of but you have heard about the attacks by the Washington Post coming out with
[00:51.840 --> 00:56.560]  tweets trying to pretend that nobody showed up to hear President Trump at the rally that he had for
[00:56.560 --> 01:03.680]  Roy Moore then as President Trump says you're absolutely lying showing this empty stadium
[01:03.680 --> 01:10.000]  here's what really happened then you have the journalists lining up to defend this Washington
[01:10.000 --> 01:16.800]  Post reporter who put out this fake attack piece and then that followed CNN the previous day
[01:16.800 --> 01:24.720]  coming after Donald Trump Jr. this is weaponized media folks but yesterday we had an attack against
[01:24.720 --> 01:33.360]  Owen Shroyer as he was covering a memorial service and for for Kate Steinle here in Austin, Texas
[01:34.000 --> 01:38.000]  and a lot of anti-pop people showed up to try to shut that down and they shut down Owen and they
[01:38.000 --> 01:44.640]  didn't just shut him down they committed very serious assault against him and we're gonna
[01:44.640 --> 01:49.040]  have a clip of that when you talk about the laws understand when you talk about assault and battery
[01:50.080 --> 01:55.920]  assault is threatening somebody and being able to credibly do that and these people had
[01:56.720 --> 02:00.960]  masks on they had weapons they had shields and one of them at least was carrying a gun
[02:01.680 --> 02:07.520]  when you're carrying a gun wearing a mask and brandishing the gun that's the official way
[02:07.520 --> 02:13.680]  that the legal term for that when you're carrying a gun and using and threatening somebody either
[02:13.680 --> 02:17.280]  with the gun by the way that you're holding it or threatening them as you're holding a gun that's
[02:17.280 --> 02:24.080]  called brandishing a weapon that's called assault and so tomorrow Owen Shroyer is going to file a
[02:24.080 --> 02:29.040]  criminal complaint because the police didn't do anything about that they let them mace other people
[02:29.040 --> 02:34.880]  they got together in a big group I mean at one respect it looked like a Larpers convention
[02:34.880 --> 02:40.800]  because that's the way the NFA people are but it was a very serious assault these people were
[02:40.800 --> 02:45.680]  threatening violence they were shoving him hitting him in the back with a stick as he was trying to
[02:45.680 --> 02:51.120]  just get to the rally the people who were at the rally for Kate Steinley remember that the illegal
[02:51.120 --> 02:56.240]  immigrant who had been transported it was either five or six times I think he was either he was
[02:56.240 --> 03:02.320]  about to be deported for the sixth or seventh time when he said he just found a gun that was laying
[03:02.320 --> 03:06.880]  on the bench and and the gun just went off just like in the movies he had nothing to do with it
[03:06.880 --> 03:11.360]  it wasn't premeditated murder it wasn't even manslaughter it was just the gun did it the gun
[03:11.360 --> 03:18.320]  did it and so still no justice for Kate Steinley and that's what we're seeing over and over again
[03:18.320 --> 03:26.400]  and no protection of anybody who isn't politically correct there is no protection for people who are
[03:26.400 --> 03:32.320]  using weapons against the media and certainly no concern about that by our weaponized media
[03:32.320 --> 03:36.240]  who comes after conservatives who come after President Trump we're also going to give you
[03:36.240 --> 03:41.040]  some updates on some other stories in the news Roger Stone will be joining us to talk about
[03:41.040 --> 03:46.640]  what's going on Michael Flynn and also Tom Arnold and other issues that have surfaced many many
[03:46.640 --> 03:51.280]  things coming out in the last couple of days we have the Pentagon is now saying they're going
[03:51.280 --> 03:56.320]  to have their first ever audit well maybe it's about time because there's several trillion dollars
[03:56.320 --> 04:02.800]  missing they even have 44,000 troops missing how in the world do you do that are these
[04:02.800 --> 04:08.080]  they don't even know where their troops are they're not saying that it's classified that they
[04:08.080 --> 04:12.000]  can't tell you they're saying their destination is unknown and this is coming out of Stars and
[04:12.000 --> 04:16.960]  Stripes magazine people in the conservative media have just picked this up this is how big
[04:16.960 --> 04:21.920]  the US empire has grown America has lost track of the number of wars that we're fighting we've
[04:21.920 --> 04:26.880]  lost track of our soldiers just all over the place I mean this is the insanity that we're
[04:26.880 --> 04:31.840]  looking at here is there some way that we can ever get back to a constitutional government
[04:31.840 --> 04:36.560]  is there some way that we'll audit the Pentagon or maybe even the politicians in Washington DC
[04:37.600 --> 04:41.840]  maybe I don't think that it's going to happen I think maybe instead of auditing the Fed we may
[04:41.840 --> 04:46.640]  be able to transcend it with cryptocurrencies it's a given that other countries are going to
[04:46.640 --> 04:50.320]  transcend the petro dollar that's the only question is what's going to happen with that
[04:50.320 --> 04:51.840]  so let's be right back I'm David Knight
[04:51.840 --> 05:00.800]  Mike in Arizona you're on the air worldwide go ahead

[06:07.200 --> 06:09.280]  waging war on corruption
[06:09.280 --> 06:17.280]  it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[06:24.080 --> 06:28.160]  welcome back to the alex jones show on david night on this december the 10th 2017
[06:29.120 --> 06:35.600]  yesterday was a pretty amazing event there was a rally in support of kate steinley to
[06:35.600 --> 06:41.040]  draw attention to that travesty that happened in san francisco the sanctuary city that is now
[06:41.040 --> 06:46.000]  given sanctuary to the murder saying he had absolutely nothing to do with her death even
[06:46.000 --> 06:52.800]  though there was a loaded gun that was stolen out of the seat of a plm officers car somehow that just
[06:52.800 --> 06:58.480]  went off close to this individual who was about to be deported for either the sixth or the seventh
[06:58.480 --> 07:02.560]  time kept coming in he'd have been convicted of multiple felonies but he said that the gun just
[07:02.560 --> 07:06.160]  went off on his own just like in the movies he had absolutely nothing to do with it you know
[07:06.160 --> 07:10.400]  he just set these things down and they're so dangerous that the liberals think that they
[07:10.400 --> 07:16.000]  go off without anybody even touching them and so they didn't even convict him of manslaughter they
[07:16.000 --> 07:19.520]  just convicted him of having possession of a firearm when he wasn't supposed to have it
[07:20.080 --> 07:26.640]  but when you look at this event yesterday owens chore went to report on this here in austin and
[07:26.640 --> 07:32.720]  look at these larper idiots who are very violent quite frankly they were very intimidating they
[07:32.720 --> 07:37.520]  were pushing and shoving him as he was trying to get by they would get one side of the other
[07:37.520 --> 07:42.800]  i mean at one level if it wasn't for the violence that we know that they're capable of and if it
[07:42.800 --> 07:47.440]  wasn't for the fact that they are threatening him with one of the individuals not having just
[07:47.440 --> 07:53.760]  sticks and shields and helmets and masks but also one of the group had at least one of the group
[07:53.760 --> 08:00.000]  had a rifle that he was brandishing and i'm using that in the legal sense when you have a weapon
[08:00.720 --> 08:05.360]  and you are displaying it or using it or holding that weapon as you are making threats against
[08:05.360 --> 08:12.480]  people as they were against owen that is called brandishing a weapon and it also is called assault
[08:12.480 --> 08:16.880]  when you're making credible threats against somebody whether it is with a stick with
[08:16.880 --> 08:24.000]  with a nail in the end of it or even if it's just a stick and a group of people he was surrounded
[08:24.000 --> 08:28.240]  by people there were people in the back of him that you don't see in that video so let's play
[08:28.240 --> 08:31.840]  some of this video and i'll narrate it for the people who are listening on the radio this is
[08:31.840 --> 08:39.440]  owens chore yesterday at a memorial in recognition of kate steinle and austin texas and the people
[08:39.440 --> 08:46.560]  who showed up in force were antifa marxists you can see some of them wearing masks that have
[08:46.560 --> 08:52.000]  a hammer and sickle on it so here's that video owens chore here for info wars dot com i am in
[08:52.000 --> 09:02.000]  downtown austin texas i am about to walk into woldridge square here where you have a kate steinle
[09:02.000 --> 09:07.280]  march happening that has been invaded how are you guys doing info wars i thought you'd say
[09:07.280 --> 09:14.800]  something like that after all we're trying to honor a dead person here but that didn't stop
[09:14.800 --> 09:21.600]  protesters from showing up with megaphones and shouting obscenities hey how you doing man hey

[09:32.720 --> 09:37.840]  in austin it's basically an ad drunk to san francisco you're protesting kate steinle
[09:39.040 --> 09:42.960]  hey what brought you out here today sir you know my name so maybe he'll talk to me i'm just trying

[10:22.400 --> 10:29.200]  along masks you would throw me out you would beat my ass if we were at a bar you'd beat my ass
[10:31.040 --> 10:36.240]  yeah there's a guy with his hand on the trigger uh standing right behind these guys looking at
[10:36.240 --> 10:40.800]  on and he's got a mask with a hammer and sickle on it they're saying are you afraid you should be
[10:40.800 --> 10:46.160]  afraid and uh it's not like in what wearing a trump hat is a safe thing to do suddenly you're
[10:46.160 --> 10:50.880]  against the second amendment when did i say that well you are the one that's saying this is not
[10:50.880 --> 10:56.560]  exercising the second amendment it is assault with a deadly weapon it is brandishing a weapon
[10:56.560 --> 11:00.640]  those are felonies i'm literally surrounded by a bunch of guys compounded by the fact they're wearing
[11:01.200 --> 11:06.080]  masks because they know that they're breaking the law or about to or want to oh my gosh look
[11:06.080 --> 11:09.280]  at this guy he's scared are you not trying to intimidate me is that not your purpose out here

[11:15.440 --> 11:19.280]  and as he tries to walk around them we're trying to honor dead people and this is they create a
[11:19.280 --> 11:23.440]  wall with their shields or sticks and their firearms with you guys seriously kind of like the uh

[12:11.760 --> 12:16.400]  and you cover your faces why do you cover your faces at least this guy has enough courage to
[12:16.400 --> 12:21.760]  not have his face covered why won't you guys uncover your face with a peaceful streets project
[12:21.760 --> 12:26.720]  so are these guys not peaceful then yeah don't talk to me so you're with the peaceful streets
[12:26.720 --> 12:31.760]  project that's why your face is uncovered why is there's faces covered so they can punch you

[12:35.840 --> 12:45.280]  here this is obviously insane oh my god i can't even we're the police i'm in care right now you
[12:45.280 --> 12:50.960]  know the police were johnny on the spot whenever we were there whenever you got people who were
[12:51.920 --> 12:57.680]  protesting for the right to open carry carrying a black powder rifle which is legal by the way
[12:57.680 --> 13:04.560]  open carry and the police arrested those individuals but they don't they don't care if these guys if
[13:04.560 --> 13:09.920]  guys with masks and firearms and sticks and shields are there they don't care about that interesting
[13:10.640 --> 13:17.280]  how what nazi scum nazis are socialists just like you how am i a nazi scum you are a nazi scum
[13:17.280 --> 13:23.680]  what just happened to you who maced you i don't know she ran like she maced me and then she ran
[13:23.680 --> 13:29.280]  the other way antifa was it antifa hopefully hopefully some of these violent protesters
[13:29.280 --> 13:36.640]  are being arrested here all right we're being protected out here antifa is getting out of
[13:36.640 --> 13:47.760]  control antifa is now getting totally out of control here all right so the police have shown
[13:47.760 --> 13:52.480]  up they are walking their bicycles which they also use kind of as shields in this particular
[13:52.480 --> 13:58.400]  kind of situation they were beating people are you all right sir yes did you see the mace people
[13:58.400 --> 14:02.480]  i didn't see no mace yeah i didn't smell no you saw the mace people i saw the mace jim moe
[14:02.480 --> 14:08.080]  and one chick just elbowed me you got hit you got elbowed i did you got mace too yes you got elbowed
[14:08.080 --> 14:12.800]  in the chest it looks like they may by the antifa people they're macing people attacking
[14:12.800 --> 14:17.360]  and you know there's there's more the antifa people there than there are i think uh people who
[14:17.360 --> 14:22.800]  are there to honor kate steinley she'll talk both of us and to draw attention to the miscarriage
[14:22.800 --> 14:26.880]  of justice man that was having a conversation with us that these people are violent and then
[14:26.880 --> 14:33.200]  it happened so this is what we expected with these people so this is one of the antifa members
[14:33.200 --> 14:41.040]  who just got arrested and um he's still telling people to f off outside the car he's got an ear
[14:41.040 --> 14:45.440]  piece in i'm wondering why that guy has an ear piece in this is an antifa protester out here
[14:45.440 --> 14:50.400]  with an ear piece in that's very strange all right if you want to see that we've got an article up
[14:50.400 --> 14:55.200]  at info wars dot com antifa violently protest of a royal for a woman killed by illegal alien
[14:55.760 --> 15:03.920]  and we also have the video uh that is unedited in the full video we have up on alex jones channel
[15:04.800 --> 15:10.240]  this is what we're seeing over and over again and that is the attempt to intimidate people
[15:10.240 --> 15:14.640]  the mainstream media doesn't care about that we see here's an example of this you know we'd look at
[15:14.640 --> 15:21.360]  this white teen who was tortured the guy who has an iq of a four-year-old and there were three black
[15:21.360 --> 15:27.840]  people he's been let off kate steinle's murder has been let off not even charged with manslaughter
[15:27.840 --> 15:33.120]  just let off uh that's what we see happening the death threats against the fcc chairman
[15:33.680 --> 15:38.800]  over net neutrality they just leave that up no problem they leave that up meanwhile youtube takes
[15:38.800 --> 15:46.320]  down poland the polish government's video exposing the migrant invasion and say this is bad policy
[15:46.320 --> 15:50.160]  it's coming from the e you we're not going to allow that to happen here in poland that's taken down
[15:50.720 --> 15:55.600]  by youtube essentially isolated in a purgatory they they left it up but they told people no no
[15:55.600 --> 16:02.160]  you can't watch this content matt in ohio you're on the air another matt go ahead yeah hey listen
[16:02.160 --> 16:07.120]  i just wanted to say real quick i'm a long time listener of uh in fours and i i just wanted to
[16:07.120 --> 16:13.040]  say that the t-shirts that you guys are offering are absolutely fantastic and that really is a great
[16:13.040 --> 16:18.720]  way to deal with this battle in the info war it might seem like a simple thing but they particularly
[16:18.720 --> 16:24.720]  these slogan t-shirts that you guys got up right now are absolutely amazing well thank you my favorite
[16:24.720 --> 16:30.800]  new one uh is the don't tread on me but said it says won't tread on me and it's a big deglo snake
[16:30.800 --> 16:35.760]  gatson snake and then it's got the american flag info wars dot com on the right arm i mean that's a
[16:35.760 --> 16:41.520]  great way just to meet like-minded people uh and spread the word and also exercise free speech and
[16:41.520 --> 16:48.320]  the newest one is trigger warning t-shirt trigger warning t-shirt which is the symbol of a trigger
[16:48.320 --> 16:54.160]  with a yield sign and then info wars dot com on the back that is the new shirt of the mind available
[16:54.160 --> 16:59.680]  exclusively at info wars store dot com not a group you develop living defense for us it took you
[16:59.680 --> 17:05.040]  over a year to do it why is this so good because people are actually waking up to the problem that
[17:05.040 --> 17:10.960]  pretty much scares me the most i mean i try to make sure that i don't put toxins from food and
[17:10.960 --> 17:16.640]  water and beverages in my system but right now we're dealing with massive parasites which is

[20:34.400 --> 20:37.920]  we'll come back on david night on this sunday december the 10th 2017
[20:37.920 --> 20:48.800]  we're going to get back to this event yesterday it was a memorial service in honor of kate steinley
[20:48.800 --> 20:53.680]  to draw attention to the injustice that happened in san francisco but as you saw if you're watching
[20:53.680 --> 21:01.200]  that last segment you saw that the hateful violence of antifa is not limited to california
[21:01.200 --> 21:06.640]  we have quite a few people here in austin that are just like that but it's also a story of
[21:06.640 --> 21:15.520]  all across this country we have the situation where the three black teens captured a young white teen
[21:16.400 --> 21:22.960]  and tortured him he's got an IQ of a four-year-old tortured him and filmed it they thought it was
[21:22.960 --> 21:28.960]  great they put it up on social media and the judge basically let them plead guilty to a hate crime
[21:28.960 --> 21:34.480]  aggravated battery and intimidation but let them off without any prison time to just get
[21:34.480 --> 21:37.840]  to community service he said i'm not sure that you'd come out of prison any better well that's not
[21:37.840 --> 21:45.600]  the point there's a punishment element there's a message that needs to be sent that we're not
[21:45.600 --> 21:49.920]  going to allow you to get away with no punishment that's the message that he's sending certainly
[21:49.920 --> 21:52.720]  they're not going to be any better and nobody else is going to be any better if they realize
[21:52.720 --> 21:58.880]  that they can take somebody with the IQ of a four-year-old torture them and pay no penalty for
[21:58.880 --> 22:03.760]  that 200 hours of community service whatever that means they dropped charges of kidnapping
[22:03.760 --> 22:09.040]  which would have given them serious time but basically give them a walk students meanwhile
[22:09.040 --> 22:17.280]  in a coffee shop at a university this is in a bronx campus a social justice warrior got them
[22:17.280 --> 22:22.160]  booted out of for them university they're in a coffee shop and they had the audacity to wear a
[22:22.160 --> 22:28.880]  trump make america great again hat and so that violated their safe space policy they were thrown
[22:28.880 --> 22:32.960]  out of the coffee shop they said we weren't even talking politics we were talking about final exams
[22:32.960 --> 22:36.800]  they said get out five minutes as a worker i'm protecting our customers you're wearing
[22:36.800 --> 22:42.880]  hats that are completely violate the safe space policy you have to go that is the attitude
[22:43.680 --> 22:48.960]  and the training that results in what we just saw with these antifa students
[22:49.840 --> 22:57.680]  and austin attacking oh and short aggravated assault brandishing a firearm wearing masks
[22:57.680 --> 23:03.680]  while they were doing it body blocking him checking him uh hitting him from behind hitting him from
[23:03.680 --> 23:08.160]  in front saying excuse me you know the shallow buff approach and then look what happens on social
[23:08.160 --> 23:14.720]  media we've had twitter this is an article from drum coursey this last week on info wars twitter
[23:14.720 --> 23:20.800]  allowing death threats against the fcc chair pie ahead of the net neutrality vote listen to the
[23:20.800 --> 23:27.600]  things that twitter thinks are okay remember they banned roger stone because he criticized cnn
[23:29.280 --> 23:33.120]  and uh they leave people up it wasn't the language that he used it was the fact that he
[23:33.120 --> 23:38.080]  criticized cnn but listen to the language the people who are threatening the fcc commissioner
[23:38.080 --> 23:42.240]  say and this is okay with twitter they leave this up i hope you get assassinated another one i have
[23:42.240 --> 23:47.840]  your address i will go to your house for answers if this passes another one people will murder you
[23:47.840 --> 23:53.440]  congress trump and they'll put your heads on spikes there's already talk and people are getting ready
[23:54.080 --> 23:58.640]  so if you want to live leave our internet alone these are the idiots who have been brainwashed
[23:59.360 --> 24:05.760]  by the press brainwashed by their universities and they feel that it is absolutely okay to be violent
[24:05.760 --> 24:11.520]  and that is reinforced by the judges who let them off the judges who let off the illegal aliens
[24:11.520 --> 24:18.240]  uh like the one that killed kate steinle here's some more tweets we should rape his wife and
[24:18.240 --> 24:22.640]  tie him up with a tape logged on his mouth hear him cry while we have some fun another one kill
[24:22.640 --> 24:26.480]  yourself another one reminder i hope bad things happen to you and your family another one i hope
[24:26.480 --> 24:32.640]  you're killed children get cancer and another one someone needs to walk behind adjit and inject him
[24:32.640 --> 24:37.680]  with bleach or introduce a meat cleaver to his skull and short i agree he's a horrific person
[24:37.680 --> 24:43.680]  and he deserves the absolute worst finally if net neutrality actually gets repealed you will be the
[24:43.680 --> 24:48.400]  most hated person in america you best delete all your social media and get plastic surgery now because
[24:48.400 --> 24:54.480]  if anyone recognizes you after that you're going to get the blank kicked out kicked in or hopefully
[24:54.480 --> 25:01.920]  killed this these are probably teenagers who are not being censored by twitter by social media
[25:01.920 --> 25:07.680]  but who gets censored the polish government by youtube what did they say they had a video that
[25:07.680 --> 25:13.280]  said europe opens its eyes and admits that we are right that the polish government the problem
[25:13.280 --> 25:17.760]  is connected with what the west of europe is struggling with decades of a policy of multiculturalism
[25:17.760 --> 25:22.480]  and political correctness our government chooses a responsible way to fight the problem of illegal
[25:22.480 --> 25:28.000]  immigration the short presentation was flagged by youtube as being age and appropriate that's
[25:28.000 --> 25:32.560]  the way that they censor they say wow we still left it up there but we just flagged it as age
[25:32.560 --> 25:37.920]  and appropriate why would that be age and appropriate why is it language like we just saw
[25:37.920 --> 25:42.240]  on twitter why isn't that age and appropriate why do they allow isis videos up why do they
[25:43.120 --> 25:50.160]  allow death threats up why does the judiciary allow tortures of disabled teenagers to go free
[25:52.080 --> 25:56.240]  they say of course you know when they label it as age and appropriate that means that you
[25:56.240 --> 26:00.880]  don't have any comments it can't be shared it can't be embedded it doesn't get any view count
[26:00.880 --> 26:06.160]  it doesn't get any user ratings nobody can find it we've had them do that to us for things that are
[26:06.160 --> 26:13.040]  not violent to say what they call a limited state essentially purgatory as we point out on news wars
[26:13.040 --> 26:19.120]  purgatory for content deemed as offensive or extremist by faceless information gatekeepers
[26:19.760 --> 26:22.080]  that's the weaponized media and the weaponized media of course
[26:22.080 --> 26:30.080]  is part of the social media because the old dinosaur media whatever you want to call them
[26:30.080 --> 26:36.480]  nobody is paying that much attention to cnn to abc nbccbs where the real power is where the real
[26:36.480 --> 26:44.560]  censorship must be is on social media and this is crony censorship if the government were to come
[26:44.560 --> 26:49.120]  in and shut things down some people might wake up even some liberals at that point might wake up i
[26:49.120 --> 26:52.880]  don't know maybe they wouldn't maybe their hatred has blinded them so much they wouldn't wake up even
[26:52.880 --> 26:57.760]  if the government were to directly censor people that day is coming soon make no mistake about it
[26:58.400 --> 27:01.680]  but they don't want to head on with anybody what they want to do
[27:02.400 --> 27:08.960]  is have their corporate surrogates who operate under a position of crony capitalism they want
[27:08.960 --> 27:13.280]  them to do the censorship we've seen this before when i've been involved with the third party
[27:13.280 --> 27:17.360]  wanting to get into debates and of course we had to jump through hoops that the democrats and
[27:17.360 --> 27:21.920]  republicans never had to jump through to get on the ballot once on the ballot the debates are being
[27:21.920 --> 27:29.600]  run by a private corporation usually it was a media association some kind of newspaper
[27:29.600 --> 27:35.600]  or a news association would run the debates and they would choose to exclude us arbitrarily
[27:36.480 --> 27:40.640]  and we would say uh how how can you just we would appeal to the government they say well it's a
[27:40.640 --> 27:45.360]  private organization they can do whatever they want who gave them that power oh that would be
[27:45.360 --> 27:48.800]  the government run by the republicans and the democrats would give them the power
[27:48.800 --> 27:52.320]  of censorship over other people to decide who's going to be included and who isn't
[27:52.960 --> 27:58.400]  and of course the government was there at the beginning funding through incutel the cia's venture
[27:58.400 --> 28:03.520]  capital firm and other means funding the creation of google and facebook helping to give them a
[28:03.520 --> 28:10.240]  default monopoly and then standing back and proclaiming innocence as they shut other people
[28:10.240 --> 28:16.080]  down as the surrogates for the government they have to go a little bit further they have to
[28:16.080 --> 28:22.400]  shut down all political debate do it with algorithms and then once they do that then you'll have the
[28:22.400 --> 28:27.760]  hardcore censorship that'll come straight from the government just like it does in china but right
[28:27.760 --> 28:32.960]  now they're using their surrogates that's the weaponized media that's the media that doesn't
[28:32.960 --> 28:37.520]  complain when weapons are used against real media when they're used against people like
[28:37.520 --> 28:41.200]  oan trying to report on an event stay with us to be right back i'm david night

[33:19.200 --> 33:29.600]  welcome back i'm david night and this sunday december the 10th 2017 a lot of things have happened
[33:29.600 --> 33:34.000]  in the last couple of days a lot of fake news coming after president trump and we've also had
[33:34.000 --> 33:41.440]  another sexual harassment case this time coming after a judge in the ninth circuit court the
[33:41.440 --> 33:45.920]  liberal court that gets overturned and all the rest of them combined i believe i'm just kind of
[33:45.920 --> 33:50.960]  guessing because it gets overturned so frequently but it's one of the judges there unfortunately he
[33:50.960 --> 33:57.840]  is supposedly the conservative at the court now being outed for sexual harassment we'll tell you
[33:57.840 --> 34:05.120]  about that as well as some updates to the latest sexual harassment circus that is going on in
[34:05.120 --> 34:09.040]  washington dc before we do real quickly i'll let you know about some of the sales we have at info
[34:09.040 --> 34:14.000]  war store dot com that's what funds this news program as well as the other programs that we've

[34:46.160 --> 34:51.600]  savings folks because it's a very expensive product to produce so the price is high on that
[34:51.600 --> 34:56.720]  typically higher than most of our other supplements because of biopqq it's a very difficult and
[34:56.720 --> 35:02.320]  expensive ingredient to add there are a lot of clinical studies if you go to infowarstore.com
[35:02.320 --> 35:07.760]  you can read about biopqq and find out about the clinical studies that talk about how it
[35:07.760 --> 35:13.520]  preserves your dna health and what we're talking about here is a little telomere the little end cap
[35:13.520 --> 35:18.560]  on the end of your dna strand it's one of the things that scientists have found if they look at that
[35:18.560 --> 35:24.720]  telomere they can predict your natural lifespan because that gradually decreases over your life
[35:24.720 --> 35:28.880]  there are some things that will accelerate that and the absence of some things as they found
[35:28.880 --> 35:33.520]  from some studies of some amish people who did not have a protein that makes that disappear
[35:33.520 --> 35:39.200]  they found those individuals had a 10 year longer lifespan because that protein did not
[35:39.200 --> 35:43.040]  eat away the telomere so there are things that you can do or things that can take away
[35:43.600 --> 35:48.800]  destructive elements in your system that may be there due to hereditary instances or just

[36:52.080 --> 36:57.360]  we appreciate your support especially this time of year all right so we've got Al Franken
[36:57.360 --> 37:02.000]  who resigned last week or maybe he didn't resign who knows we had a poll up i put a poll up on
[37:02.000 --> 37:08.160]  liberty terry in my twitter site and we had about 11 and a half thousand people vote on it 50%
[37:08.160 --> 37:13.600]  of them think that he's planning on staying i think he is i think it's looking to him as well
[37:13.600 --> 37:19.920]  as to other people that roymor is going to win in alabama they are now even having their polls
[37:19.920 --> 37:26.240]  come back this is that line from the hill saying more bumps jones from the top of an alabama senate
[37:26.240 --> 37:31.360]  poll jones has never been on the top of any of these alabama senate polls this is one of the most
[37:31.360 --> 37:37.520]  republican areas most pro trump areas you're going to find and they're now moving from the push poll
[37:37.520 --> 37:43.840]  stage we do polls and you pick the mix of voters democrat and republican to get the outcome that
[37:43.840 --> 37:48.400]  you want then you tell everybody look my candidate is winning so they went through this push poll
[37:48.400 --> 37:54.160]  stage and now it's not worked it hasn't worked they realized it's not working and they're going
[37:54.160 --> 38:00.560]  into the damage control stage where they tell people yeah we we knew that roymor was going to win
[38:00.560 --> 38:06.160]  and so now this is uh very telling i think when you see the hill and others start to come out with
[38:06.160 --> 38:13.760]  this and the fact that he is getting so desperate that he is bringing in cori booker and the uh
[38:13.760 --> 38:20.560]  governor of massachusetts devol patrick campaign for him after having criticized the more campaign
[38:20.560 --> 38:25.360]  for having steve bannon come down to call steve bannon a carpet bagger uh do you think that the
[38:25.360 --> 38:31.360]  senator from new jersey and the governor of massachusetts as liberal as they are might be
[38:31.360 --> 38:37.280]  considered to be carpet baggers by the people in alabama this is the desperation of the dug
[38:37.280 --> 38:43.680]  jones campaign and of course president trump was at a rally in pennsycola which is really close to
[38:43.680 --> 38:48.640]  one of the larger cities in alabama mobile alabama uh he was there he talked a good deal about
[38:48.640 --> 38:54.160]  roymor and the election in alabama had a direct appeal to the voters there and he's going to be
[38:54.160 --> 39:00.480]  in alabama campaigning for roymor tomorrow but i think as al franken is looking at this i think
[39:00.480 --> 39:07.520]  it's very important for him there was a real revolt building against al franken with the women in
[39:07.520 --> 39:12.800]  the senate especially the um you know the democrats especially the women but it was not just women but
[39:12.800 --> 39:17.600]  mostly women coming after him he had to tamp that down whatever he's going to do whether he's going
[39:17.600 --> 39:22.400]  to try to have a career go back to saturday night live or whatever he's going to do with his life
[39:22.400 --> 39:29.120]  after this uh he had to tamp that down number one number two he never never uh admitted to doing
[39:29.120 --> 39:35.840]  anything wrong he held a press conference and he criticized president trump and roymor and said
[39:35.840 --> 39:41.440]  in the coming weeks i will be resigning he didn't resign and he didn't admit anything wrong he said
[39:41.440 --> 39:46.800]  he called the women who accused him liars and i'm surprised that there hasn't been more reaction
[39:46.800 --> 39:53.200]  from uh even the democrats on this the fact that he presented himself as a champion of women and
[39:53.200 --> 39:58.800]  said they have a right to be heard but not to be believed not by al franken anyway so i think that
[39:58.800 --> 40:04.240]  he's not simply just staying for the christmas party i think he's waiting for roymor to get in
[40:04.880 --> 40:10.880]  and then say see uh you can't throw me out and i'm staying when in reality what is happening
[40:10.880 --> 40:15.920]  is the people in alabama do not believe the charges against roymor and we have just had
[40:15.920 --> 40:21.440]  and we'll talk about this more later in the broadcast uh but now gloria allred's client the
[40:21.440 --> 40:27.280]  one with a phony yearbook came out and said yeah yeah some of that i wrote this is just collapsing
[40:27.280 --> 40:33.280]  on them at the last minute it's it's going very badly for them and so nobody believes those charges
[40:33.280 --> 40:38.160]  but everybody has seen pictures they've seen a lot of contemporary charges against al franken
[40:38.960 --> 40:44.000]  a lot of stuff has surfaced from him there's no question about it with al franken and uh
[40:44.000 --> 40:48.560]  he's going to try to create an equivalency there and there you can see these people showing the
[40:49.200 --> 40:52.560]  the yearbook we're going to get back to that in a moment i want to talk about what's going on in
[40:52.560 --> 40:56.880]  the ninth circuit court of appeals as fox news reported a prominent appeals court judge of the
[40:56.880 --> 41:02.560]  ninth circuit court has been accused of sexual harassment he was the former chief judge on the
[41:02.560 --> 41:09.840]  ninth circuit court of appeals his name is alex kazinsky 67 he was actually appointed by ronald
[41:09.840 --> 41:14.400]  reagan somebody on the ninth circuit court of appeals was appointed by ronald reagan imagine that
[41:15.120 --> 41:19.600]  and he may be a conservative i don't know maybe everybody else is drowning out all of his votes
[41:19.600 --> 41:27.280]  here but this isn't actually his first rodeo he has been accused by several women two women
[41:27.280 --> 41:32.160]  told the washington post that he asked them to look at pornography on a computer in his chambers
[41:32.160 --> 41:40.160]  but back in 2008 he actually maintained a website with sexually explicit photos and videos and he
[41:40.160 --> 41:45.920]  got called on it there was an ethics investigation and when they looked at this website he said
[41:45.920 --> 41:50.400]  i know i shouldn't have put that up i'll take it down right away they go okay that's fine just be
[41:50.400 --> 41:57.440]  more careful in the future that's that's the state of our government yeah just be more careful in
[41:57.440 --> 42:02.320]  the future well i guess he wasn't careful enough because instead of having this public website he
[42:02.320 --> 42:08.400]  just kept it on his on his computer and decided that he would show it to the women who worked for
[42:08.400 --> 42:14.400]  him as they came into his office and we look at this and we look at the fact that we keep hearing
[42:14.400 --> 42:19.760]  that the us house is considering changes to the law that would protect that protects the identities
[42:19.760 --> 42:26.080]  politicians and pays off the women that they sexually harass this is believe it or not the
[42:26.080 --> 42:30.480]  office of compliance and it was part of the congressional accountability act that they say
[42:30.480 --> 42:35.680]  well we can't tell you who these people are they call it the congressional accountability act
[42:36.240 --> 42:41.920]  you know just like we had the patriot act which and and we had the usa freedom act or the affordable
[42:41.920 --> 42:45.840]  health care act which was not affordable didn't have anything to do with health care and now this
[42:45.840 --> 42:53.600]  is the congressional accountability act which conceals when these people engage in sexual
[42:53.600 --> 43:00.720]  harassment and pays up to 17 million dollars so far i'm so excited the new product at info wars

[47:28.560 --> 47:29.760]  welcome back i'm david night
[47:30.800 --> 47:37.360]  you know sololensky and his rules for radicals one of the rules said ridicule is the most powerful
[47:37.360 --> 47:43.760]  weapon and i think that's what's behind a lot of these ad hominem attacks that we see against people
[47:43.760 --> 47:50.320]  in the trump administration the most vicious ones coming from chelsea handler now attacking
[47:50.320 --> 47:55.360]  sarah sanders who's the white house press secretary she's doing a great job the only thing
[47:55.360 --> 48:02.240]  that they can say about sarah sanders is try to destroy her with ridicule and chelsea handler has
[48:02.240 --> 48:08.480]  been all over this course i don't think that chelsea handler probably isn't smart enough to realize
[48:09.600 --> 48:14.480]  to use sololensky's rule for radicals as a strategy i think she's simply looking at this and saying
[48:14.480 --> 48:18.640]  hey it worked for steven cobert his show was failing until he started mocking president trump and
[48:18.640 --> 48:24.000]  republicans and trump voters worked for jimmy kimmel it even works for failing saturday night
[48:24.000 --> 48:31.120]  live they can keep doing the same joke every week with alex baldwin and it never seems to get stale
[48:31.120 --> 48:36.560]  to their audiences so i guess chelsea handler as she got her netflix show canceled as we have
[48:36.560 --> 48:41.600]  seen in the past that chelsea handler will do anything anything to try to get an audience
[48:42.480 --> 48:46.560]  including taking her clothes off and admitting hey i wouldn't be doing this if i didn't want to be
[48:46.560 --> 48:54.160]  fam famous and yet she comes after sarah sanders and calls sarah sanders a whore because of the
[48:54.160 --> 48:59.760]  way she puts on makeup she doesn't like her makeup oh really really uh that's uh that's
[48:59.760 --> 49:05.760]  chelsea handler so she gets somebody who is a comedian and uh i guess the comedian i use that
[49:05.760 --> 49:12.640]  term in uh lightly they would call themselves that and they do a video now mocking sarah sanders
[49:12.640 --> 49:19.360]  putting on makeup uh a morbidly obese woman putting on makeup and here's part of that video and i
[49:19.360 --> 49:25.840]  want to give you the response of sarah sanders father mike huckabee after we finish this it was
[49:25.840 --> 49:31.600]  a masterful and really quite truthful and compassionate takedown uh he threw some shade
[49:31.600 --> 49:36.560]  on her that she deserved but it was very uh compassionate really uh kind of reaching out
[49:36.560 --> 49:41.920]  to her and talking to other people uh like her but let's take a look at the latest hit piece
[49:41.920 --> 49:48.000]  from chelsea handler against sarah sanders hey y'all it's me sarah huckabee sanders here's my
[49:48.000 --> 49:55.360]  first makeup youtube tutorial now i like to start with a nice moisturizer i like to just
[49:55.360 --> 50:01.040]  sop it up here right now my skin is dry just like portorico right before that this is a man i'm not
[50:01.040 --> 50:05.200]  really sure i'm gonna go ahead get this moisturizer in my hand i'm gonna arm on this face right up
[50:05.200 --> 50:11.600]  and just i don't know put it all over your face i like gravy my face is a big fat biscuit this is a
[50:11.600 --> 50:16.320]  primer that goes on funny are you are you all rolling on the floor laughing at this comedian
[50:16.320 --> 50:21.600]  quote unquote you can't even see it after you rub it in it's invisible just like the link to sign up
[50:21.600 --> 50:27.600]  for obama care get a look at that this is just like the help i get from obama care it's invisible
[50:27.600 --> 50:35.120]  to america it's republican it's strong and it's white actually it looks pretty brown all right
[50:35.120 --> 50:40.160]  so you're gonna take this foundation and grab you a beauty blender oh this is a beauty blender right
[50:40.160 --> 50:46.480]  here it may look like a butt plug but it's not stick a beauty blender up your butt once okay so
[50:46.480 --> 50:52.000]  let's just kind of leave this this is the this is the left and you want to know why we have so much
[50:52.000 --> 50:57.920]  perversion and sexual harassment there is because women are like that if that is in fact a woman i
[50:57.920 --> 51:03.840]  don't know scroll a little bit to the end so people can see the end result here of this quote
[51:03.840 --> 51:11.280]  unquote comedian fortune feimster is the person's name not sure if that's male or female and i'm
[51:11.280 --> 51:17.440]  not sure that that's funny certainly isn't funny to me uh there we go that's the end result of this
[51:17.440 --> 51:24.800]  child in front of a camera rubbing makeup all over his or her face uh to make fun of sarah
[51:24.800 --> 51:32.720]  sanders who is taking down the press every day left and right like a boss and all they can do
[51:32.720 --> 51:40.480]  is try to make fun of her putting on her makeup here's what uh mike huckabee had to say of course
[51:40.480 --> 51:45.280]  sarah sanders is his daughter here's what he has to say when people asked him about that
[51:47.440 --> 51:52.720]  really quickly though to another topic and that is late night host chelsea handler she
[51:52.720 --> 51:58.000]  as i'm sure you saw made i thought a disgusting mocking video of your daughter press secretary
[51:58.000 --> 52:04.480]  sarah sanders uh and this is my thing governor as you know i have very little crossover politically
[52:04.480 --> 52:09.680]  with your daughter but i have to tell you i think she's doing an incredible job in a very difficult
[52:09.680 --> 52:15.600]  role and i was sickened by this display of just anti-feminism backfires on the rest of the stuff
[52:15.600 --> 52:20.160]  that they're doing backfires on chelsea handler which her reaction as both a politician and also
[52:20.160 --> 52:26.320]  father well as a father you never like to see this kind of stuff on your kids but you know my
[52:26.320 --> 52:32.240]  daughter's an adult she's uh lived in the political arena her whole life she understands it she gets
[52:32.240 --> 52:38.240]  it she doesn't particularly like it but it doesn't get to her like i'm sure chelsea handler wishes it
[52:38.240 --> 52:44.320]  did uh my daughter's a very balanced person she wakes up every morning uh to a loving husband
[52:44.320 --> 52:50.320]  to three adorable children whose arms circle her neck and it's something that gives her a balance
[52:50.320 --> 52:56.560]  that i i feel sorry for chelsea handler it's not something she understands her vicious attacks are
[52:56.560 --> 53:01.040]  beginning to backfire on her and you know she's called a late night host i think it's so late now
[53:01.040 --> 53:11.600]  that she's not on anymore well the thing is she's moving into the realm of keith olbermann
[53:11.600 --> 53:17.360]  where she just no longer people can take her seriously but honestly i i feel sorry for her
[53:17.360 --> 53:23.440]  and i owe her an apology because last week in talking about some other vicious things she said
[53:23.440 --> 53:29.040]  about my daughter i said well yeah she's almost my age she you know she needs to kind of start
[53:29.040 --> 53:35.040]  mellowing out and then i realized she's nowhere near my age she just looked like it and i thought
[53:35.040 --> 53:39.760]  that's unfortunate and and i'm not saying that to be mean but i no seriously and i'm trying to be
[53:39.760 --> 53:45.440]  honest here when people are bitter and they live their lives in anger in hostility to what others
[53:46.560 --> 53:53.360]  it shows it it just it takes away accountants that that people need and and i'm not trying to be funny
[53:53.360 --> 53:59.840]  honestly people who are bitter and angry and lash out at others and have no sense of personal
[54:00.880 --> 54:07.200]  balance and joy um it's unfortunate and and that's why i say with all sincerity i feel sorry
[54:07.200 --> 54:13.040]  for her i don't envy her and i guarantee in my daughter deaden nope mr more you know that's
[54:13.040 --> 54:16.960]  interesting hang on that's uh yeah that's where i'll read we'll get to that in a moment yeah i
[54:16.960 --> 54:23.600]  was reminded i can't remember who it was who said it but uh there was a a wit who once said by 40 we
[54:23.600 --> 54:29.360]  all have the face we deserve i think that's what what mike ikebi was talking about what he said
[54:29.360 --> 54:35.200]  i thought she was my age and he was saying the bitterness that is inside of telsie handler
[54:35.200 --> 54:42.560]  just bubbles up to the surface in a very ugly way she doesn't realize the blessings of life
[54:42.560 --> 54:48.560]  of a home a family of children and she is viciously striking out just as her show was
[54:48.560 --> 54:54.080]  canceled he pointed out it's gotten so late that it's now i disappeared uh it is now late as in
[54:54.080 --> 54:59.280]  dead and gone the uh telsie handler show that was on netflix it's canceled so uh this is why
[54:59.280 --> 55:03.360]  she's she's desperate she says she's going to focus on politics um i don't know if that's really
[55:03.360 --> 55:08.240]  the focus of before she's done but it's backfiring just as the attacks against president trump or
[55:08.240 --> 55:14.160]  president trump are backfiring one of the people uh coming responding to telsie handler on twitter
[55:14.160 --> 55:21.440]  a lot of people uh kicked back on her uh i said glad to see how much of a strong feminist you are
[55:21.440 --> 55:28.960]  telsie handler by promoting positive body image of other females uh because she said this woman
[55:28.960 --> 55:32.240]  deserves to be taken down she is pure evil so she's going to do anything that she can
[55:32.240 --> 55:40.240]  and to destroy sarah sanders personally she's not evil she is able to restore some rationale to
[55:40.240 --> 55:46.720]  these press conferences where it is nothing but weaponized irrational attacks against president
[55:46.720 --> 55:52.160]  trump but um anyway my click would be is right these vicious attacks are starting to backfire
[55:52.160 --> 55:56.880]  and here's another one that backfired a vicious attack against president trump and uh it was from
[55:56.880 --> 56:04.320]  dav weigel washington post reporter he tweeted out pictures of an empty stadium as president
[56:04.320 --> 56:10.720]  trump was making his speech in pizzicola florida except that it was simply a hit job and as zero
[56:10.720 --> 56:17.200]  hedge points out a day after cnn botched their hit job on president trump and his son uh which came
[56:17.200 --> 56:22.960]  a week after the erroneous abc report on general flan sent stocks tumbling which came a month after
[56:22.960 --> 56:29.280]  bloomberg's justin sink launched coy gate during president trump's trip to japan then we have this
[56:29.280 --> 56:35.360]  guy dav weigel tweets out photo of an empty arena uh before the trump rally it was taken
[56:35.360 --> 56:39.280]  hours before the rally and of course there were a lot of people there and they took pictures of
[56:39.280 --> 56:46.560]  the rally as it was underway so clearly that was um a lie he got called out on it he eventually
[56:46.560 --> 56:53.920]  uh came back and apologized but president trump says uh why why aren't we uh doing something
[56:53.920 --> 57:00.560]  about this and uh why are we uh and when we look at the cnn issue you got glenn greenwald out there
[57:00.560 --> 57:06.400]  saying how did this mistake in the date get past all these different people they said no action is
[57:06.400 --> 57:11.280]  going to be taken against the cnn reporter who falsely reported this information against uh
[57:11.280 --> 57:17.040]  president trump's son no action will be taken it was reviewed and we followed our procedures all that
[57:17.040 --> 57:22.880]  means is that your corruption and your fake news is systemic it runs throughout the organization
[57:22.880 --> 57:27.680]  wasn't the error of one reporter we all did that we all looked over that we all did our
[57:27.680 --> 57:32.720]  non-diligence on reporting that information so they owned that they owned that but then of course
[57:32.720 --> 57:37.600]  they're saying wait a minute president trump you shouldn't criticize that guy for putting out a fake
[57:37.600 --> 57:42.480]  picture of your rally and saying that nobody turned up you're not entitled to do that that's
[57:42.480 --> 57:47.600]  censoring free speech no they're the ones who are censoring free speech by their fake narrative

[1:00:11.200 --> 1:00:14.400]  show
[1:00:17.200 --> 1:00:23.520]  newly appointed fbi director christopher rey was on the hill attempting to save face for the bureau
[1:00:23.520 --> 1:00:29.200]  clearly overcome with a biased political agenda wielding federal powers to benefit
[1:00:29.200 --> 1:00:35.600]  mulars russian witch hunt hillary clinton's breach of national security obama's corrupt d o j
[1:00:35.600 --> 1:00:43.280]  and combi's lapdog fbi here's what i think director rey i think peter struck head of counter
[1:00:43.280 --> 1:00:50.800]  intelligence at the fbi peter struck the guy who ran the clinton investigation did all the interviews
[1:00:50.800 --> 1:00:57.920]  peter struck the guy who was running the russian investigation at the fbi peter struck mr super
[1:00:57.920 --> 1:01:04.320]  agent at the fbi i think he's the guy who took the application to the faiza court and if that
[1:01:04.320 --> 1:01:11.280]  happened i mean think if this happened if you had the fbi working with a campaign the democrats
[1:01:11.280 --> 1:01:18.000]  campaign taken opposition research dressing it all up and turn it into an intelligence document
[1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:23.840]  and taking it to the faiza court so they could spy on the other campaign if that happened that is
[1:01:23.840 --> 1:01:28.800]  as wrong as it gets and you know what maybe i'm wrong you can clear it all up you can clear it
[1:01:28.800 --> 1:01:32.640]  all up for all of us here all the congress who wants to know and frankly all of america wants to
[1:01:32.640 --> 1:01:36.800]  know you can clear it all up by release we sent you a letter two days ago just release the application
[1:01:36.800 --> 1:01:42.080]  tell us what was in it tell us if i'm wrong but i don't think i am i think that's exactly what
[1:01:42.080 --> 1:01:48.000]  happened and if it did it is as wrong as it can be and people who did that need to be held accountable
[1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:53.600]  surely you've examined the definition and the distinction between extreme carelessness and
[1:01:54.560 --> 1:02:01.360]  and also extreme carelessness and uh and and the gross negligence that's within the statute
[1:02:01.360 --> 1:02:07.520]  you're really going to tell us today that you don't have an opinion on that distinction gross
[1:02:07.520 --> 1:02:13.120]  negligence is the language and the statute i believe but i believe also that almost anybody
[1:02:13.120 --> 1:02:18.560]  who grabbed a thesaurus would say the gross negligence and extremely careless are pretty darn
[1:02:18.560 --> 1:02:24.080]  close to each other the democrats are actually scared that the whole russia investigation is
[1:02:24.080 --> 1:02:29.760]  going to turn against them i mean these are pretty remarkable revelations that we saw yesterday
[1:02:29.760 --> 1:02:35.440]  with christopher ray who by the way is another deep state operative he was part of the enron
[1:02:35.440 --> 1:02:42.800]  prosecution with wiseman and call me and we know it's pretty clear that that was a uh an operative
[1:02:43.440 --> 1:02:48.640]  prosecution that was largely discredited overturned in the district the circuit courts
[1:02:49.600 --> 1:02:54.800]  and christopher ray was part of that operation yesterday he refused to answer questions about
[1:02:54.800 --> 1:03:03.440]  whether this fusion gps dossier the discredited dossier was used to get visa court approval
[1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:09.680]  to wiretap electronic surveillance on the trump campaign and i think it's very clear
[1:03:09.680 --> 1:03:15.120]  as jim jordan pointed out yesterday in the house judiciary committee that this is at the core of
[1:03:15.120 --> 1:03:22.640]  the corruption and now we find out that this judge who recused himself in the flin prosecution we
[1:03:22.640 --> 1:03:30.160]  didn't know why until we found out that he is on the faiza court and could be perhaps the very one
[1:03:30.160 --> 1:03:38.720]  who gave the fbi approval to wiretap trump and his campaign based on this lying fake dossier and
[1:03:38.720 --> 1:03:44.640]  now we've got fake indictments out of the swamp out of these kept grand juries and the word is
[1:03:44.640 --> 1:03:49.760]  miller's looking at an indictment maybe even of trump by christmas are they crazy enough to try
[1:03:49.760 --> 1:03:55.120]  to pull this off when in front of god country and the whole world naked as jay birds there are all
[1:03:55.120 --> 1:04:01.600]  one big crew engaged in massive fraud openly following the oversight hearing representative
[1:04:01.600 --> 1:04:07.040]  tray gowdy wrote on twitter when all other institutions we trust including congress appear
[1:04:07.040 --> 1:04:13.120]  to be broken we want to be able to look to the fbi i am counting on director ray to go back to work
[1:04:13.120 --> 1:04:19.200]  for the blindfolded woman holding a set of scales well we'll see about that the fbi needs to begin
[1:04:19.200 --> 1:04:26.480]  by investigating itself john bound reporting for info wars dot com all right and i'm david night

[1:06:05.520 --> 1:06:12.560]  and disinformation it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[1:06:19.440 --> 1:06:23.600]  welcome back i'm david night on this sunday december the 10th you know it's amazing because
[1:06:23.600 --> 1:06:30.320]  this last week we had cnn come out and say trump the promise keeper that's what's got them so upset
[1:06:30.320 --> 1:06:36.000]  they never expected him to do half of what he said he was going to do and here we are a year in and
[1:06:36.000 --> 1:06:41.840]  he's delivered on quite a bit of stuff in spite of the fact that you have the uniparty leaders
[1:06:41.840 --> 1:06:48.080]  both republican and democrats who try to block him on every measure and even people in his own
[1:06:48.080 --> 1:06:53.920]  cabinet which is interesting how he has surrounded himself with people who are against the agenda
[1:06:53.920 --> 1:06:59.440]  that he campaigned on and yet he continues to outmaneuver them and shut them down and deliver
[1:06:59.440 --> 1:07:05.120]  on his agenda one of these items was of course the moving the u.s. embassy to jerusalem the
[1:07:05.120 --> 1:07:11.680]  announcement that he would do that but also recognizing jerusalem as the capital of israel
[1:07:12.400 --> 1:07:18.720]  and it got all these democrats upset they're really angry about this and here's two of them as we've
[1:07:18.720 --> 1:07:24.800]  got julian assange tweets that says bernie sanders along with 90 other senators unanimously
[1:07:24.800 --> 1:07:30.240]  voted to move the u.s. embassy to jerusalem just this last june you know we talked about the the
[1:07:30.240 --> 1:07:38.400]  jerusalem embassy act that was passed in 1995 and the senate it was passed 93 to 5 i don't
[1:07:38.400 --> 1:07:42.560]  imagine if you go back and look i'm just guessing here but sanders and feinstein have been there
[1:07:42.560 --> 1:07:49.440]  for so long they probably were the ones who voted for it even back in 1995 and since then
[1:07:49.440 --> 1:07:55.360]  we've had all these presidents not doing what they said they were going to do they would promise so
[1:07:55.360 --> 1:08:00.400]  that they could get elected they would promise certain interest groups and that's the key thing
[1:08:00.400 --> 1:08:06.640]  to understand here whether you agree with this or not understand the way the politicians lie to us
[1:08:07.200 --> 1:08:11.360]  and the way these people are complicit because we saw the same thing happen on the republican side
[1:08:11.360 --> 1:08:15.360]  with obama care they kept coming out and saying we're going to get rid of obama care we're going
[1:08:15.360 --> 1:08:19.680]  to campaign on that we're going to have votes to shut it down and so forth but then when it could
[1:08:19.680 --> 1:08:24.880]  really pass the republicans refused to vote for it and so you see on the democrat side
[1:08:24.880 --> 1:08:29.280]  they kept promising their constituents in areas where they had a lot of jewish voters who wanted
[1:08:29.280 --> 1:08:33.760]  to see this happen the majority of americans don't really care more than 50 of americans don't care
[1:08:33.760 --> 1:08:37.600]  where the embassy is or they think that it was already in jerusalem they already thought we'd
[1:08:37.600 --> 1:08:42.720]  recognize that as a capital but there's about a quarter who are very strongly for and another
[1:08:42.720 --> 1:08:48.640]  quarter they're very strongly against and these people are people that could be used
[1:08:49.520 --> 1:08:54.240]  when it comes time to run for office diane feinstein was one of these she's out there saying
[1:08:54.240 --> 1:09:00.160]  this is a terrible decision it is dangerous there's a reason that for the last several decades all
[1:09:00.160 --> 1:09:05.280]  these presidents have not done this and now you've done this because he said he would and you said
[1:09:05.280 --> 1:09:08.640]  you were going to do this and you got elected and you took money from these lobby groups who
[1:09:08.640 --> 1:09:13.200]  wanted the embassy moved you voted for it multiple times diane feinstein and now you're outraged
[1:09:13.200 --> 1:09:18.640]  because donald trump actually did it and that's what we see all the time we see it on our issues
[1:09:18.640 --> 1:09:24.560]  as well that's the way these people govern and that's the thing that is so amazing to us and so
[1:09:24.560 --> 1:09:29.040]  refreshing and so infuriating to them bernie sanders says there's a reason why none of these
[1:09:29.040 --> 1:09:33.280]  presidents would do this this is going to undermine the peace process and uh bloominthal out of
[1:09:33.280 --> 1:09:39.600]  connecticut and so on they all are saying the same thing and then you've got trump's action
[1:09:39.600 --> 1:09:46.000]  in terms of shutting down the illegal executive orders of brock obama in terms of stealing
[1:09:46.880 --> 1:09:53.600]  hundreds of millions of acres and trump just reverses a small part of a couple of these
[1:09:53.600 --> 1:09:59.760]  in utah the bears ears and the grand staircase escalante national monuments they're not monuments
[1:09:59.760 --> 1:10:05.920]  they don't want to go through the whole process of declaring a national park instead what he did
[1:10:05.920 --> 1:10:10.080]  was he went back and he found an obscure law that hadn't been used never used in this way it was
[1:10:10.080 --> 1:10:16.480]  never intended to be used in this way the antiquities act which was set up to preserve land that uh
[1:10:16.480 --> 1:10:21.040]  was some kind of indian antiquities or whatever to preserve a small area there so it would not be
[1:10:21.920 --> 1:10:27.760]  alluded by people who are looking for souvenirs and so forth to protect that area the famous
[1:10:27.760 --> 1:10:34.000]  the famous devil's tower that you see out there was done that way and they only uh it took uh like
[1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:39.520]  a couple hundred acres around devil's tower they didn't take hundreds of millions of acres
[1:10:39.520 --> 1:10:44.800]  which is the way obama used it because obama wanted to lock up these lands for federal control
[1:10:45.680 --> 1:10:52.160]  and that truly is stealing our land stealing the people's land that's what the whole bundy issue
[1:10:52.160 --> 1:10:58.400]  is about the fact that the federal government owns 80 to 90 percent of the land in some of these
[1:10:58.400 --> 1:11:03.360]  western states and they're going to use it for their crony capitalist buddies they're going to
[1:11:04.160 --> 1:11:09.440]  sell this as a senator whether you're harry reid or you're john mccain if you're part of that corrupt
[1:11:09.440 --> 1:11:17.840]  establishment you can pass that over to some foreign corporation as john mccain did the tonto
[1:11:17.840 --> 1:11:23.120]  national forest obama didn't protect that they're going to turn that into a massive crater and it's
[1:11:23.120 --> 1:11:29.760]  being turned over to a foreign corporation this is something that has historical significance to
[1:11:29.760 --> 1:11:34.320]  the indians cultural significance to them religious significance to them it is a natural
[1:11:34.320 --> 1:11:39.120]  area that was recreational area that other people wanted to preserve instead it's turned over to
[1:11:39.120 --> 1:11:42.400]  a foreign corporation it's going to strip mine it you'll be able to see the hole from space
[1:11:43.040 --> 1:11:46.400]  and that's what they want to do throughout utah that's why they were running all the ranchers off
[1:11:46.400 --> 1:11:53.600]  that's why uh while clive and bundy took a stand all the other ranchers in that area have been run
[1:11:53.600 --> 1:11:57.760]  off they said from where i am all the way to the pacific ocean they run all the ranchers off
[1:11:57.760 --> 1:12:02.000]  because they want to take this land they can use it for the uranium they can use it for solar power
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:06.240]  projects with the chinese you name it they've got a long list of things that they want to use it for
[1:12:06.240 --> 1:12:10.720]  personally as part of the agenda 21 idea they're going to lock us in the cities the rest of the
[1:12:10.720 --> 1:12:15.520]  area is going to be off limits so when president trump rolls back just a little bit of these two
[1:12:15.520 --> 1:12:23.920]  projects where obama misused a law and did it by executive order and so president trump came in
[1:12:23.920 --> 1:12:29.200]  and with his executive order he repealed it and so patagonia the people who sell clothing uh for
[1:12:29.200 --> 1:12:33.040]  those of you who are outdoors remember this as you're shopping it was patagonia who comes out
[1:12:33.040 --> 1:12:38.320]  and says the president stole your land that's right but they didn't say which president it was
[1:12:38.320 --> 1:12:44.240]  obama who stole our land uh not president trump patagonia posted a small message underneath
[1:12:44.240 --> 1:12:49.680]  a message on his website calling trump's executive orders shrinking utah's bears ears and grand
[1:12:49.680 --> 1:12:56.880]  staircase escalante national monuments quote an illegal move no it was obama's moves that were
[1:12:56.880 --> 1:13:02.320]  illegal but this is the way we're seeing the react that they react to this even the people
[1:13:02.880 --> 1:13:09.600]  like diane feinstein bernie sanders and others who have voted time and time again to move the
[1:13:09.600 --> 1:13:15.040]  drusselm embassy are outraged when president trump actually does what he says he's going to do
[1:13:15.760 --> 1:13:19.760]  and that's why you've got these journalists coming back and attacking president trump when
[1:13:19.760 --> 1:13:24.960]  he exposes this false narrative and again why would this guy think it was important to tweet
[1:13:24.960 --> 1:13:30.480]  out an empty stadium well it's because he wants to ridicule the president he wants to mock him oh
[1:13:30.480 --> 1:13:35.760]  look nobody showed up to his rally uh no actually they did but then when president trump did that
[1:13:35.760 --> 1:13:41.920]  you have these other journalists backing up the washington post uh the guy who tweeted this stuff
[1:13:41.920 --> 1:13:46.400]  out he apologized and he retracted it but the other people are saying he's a great reporter
[1:13:46.400 --> 1:13:51.840]  he's a fantastic guide to this political age i would say he is the icon of this political age
[1:13:52.640 --> 1:13:59.120]  the hit and run false attack another one dan fifer says trump is attacking dav waggle because
[1:13:59.120 --> 1:14:04.480]  he is sad in vain so it continues on or another one tommy v tore i don't know who he works for
[1:14:04.480 --> 1:14:09.760]  the irony of this clown wanting someone fired for misrepresenting a crowd size is too much
[1:14:09.760 --> 1:14:15.520]  and yet they were the ones aren't they who made such a big deal about the size of the inauguration
[1:14:15.520 --> 1:14:20.720]  crowd and went on and on and on about it why did they do that why did they do that well
[1:14:20.720 --> 1:14:24.400]  that was their intent their intent was to ridicule another one jessica valente the president of the
[1:14:24.400 --> 1:14:29.680]  united states targeting a reporter for mass harassment is a much bigger deal than a reporter
[1:14:29.680 --> 1:14:35.920]  mistakenly tweeting a photo why why is it a bigger deal why is it the president to again they every
[1:14:35.920 --> 1:14:41.600]  time he makes a comment every time he points out how they are lying in a weaponized way for their
[1:14:41.600 --> 1:14:46.480]  own political agenda when he points out that they are not objective that they're highly politicized
[1:14:46.480 --> 1:14:51.120]  and partisan when he points that out they go furious and they accuse him of being a tyrant
[1:14:51.120 --> 1:14:56.160]  who wants to shut down free speech now he has a bully pulpit he has a right to speak as well
[1:14:56.160 --> 1:15:01.920]  and this other guy cryol griffin says the president calling for a journalist to be fired
[1:15:01.920 --> 1:15:05.360]  seems like a public threat to the first amendment see that's where they're always coming with this
[1:15:06.400 --> 1:15:10.400]  and it's like no you know gelling him would be a threat to the first amendment or maybe
[1:15:10.400 --> 1:15:16.800]  destroying his business as these people support with the gay wedding cake issue right who's who
[1:15:16.800 --> 1:15:22.640]  has free speech can you compel other people to do things that they don't want to do see when you
[1:15:22.640 --> 1:15:28.080]  jail people or you shut down their businesses but when you say hey this guy ought to be fired or you
[1:15:28.080 --> 1:15:35.600]  ought to fire these players who are disrespecting the national anthem the flag veterans at these
[1:15:35.600 --> 1:15:40.320]  football games that's just good business advice for these people advice that they won't take why
[1:15:40.320 --> 1:15:45.520]  because the nfl just like the washington post cnn they're highly politicized and they care more
[1:15:45.520 --> 1:15:51.680]  about their politics than succeeding they'll be willing to let the nfl burn down just like
[1:15:51.680 --> 1:15:58.320]  they'll burn down cnn and washington post and we'll be glad to see it matt in ohio you're on the

[1:20:31.760 --> 1:20:35.760]  trying to figure out where all the money and troops went they have they have lost
[1:20:36.320 --> 1:20:42.640]  trillions of dollars worth of money and 44 thousand dollars of 44 thousand dollars 44 thousand
[1:20:42.640 --> 1:20:47.920]  soldiers yeah it's that bad uh when you get government decided here's here's the problem
[1:20:47.920 --> 1:20:55.840]  with washington when it has grown to the cancerous size that it is now there's absolutely no way that
[1:20:55.840 --> 1:21:01.520]  anybody can control it and we're seeing this a good example this is the pentagon uh how the
[1:21:01.520 --> 1:21:07.600]  purpose of government has been perverted and it is absolutely totally unmanageable unmanageable
[1:21:08.400 --> 1:21:11.280]  before we get back to that though i just want to remind you some of the sales we have an info
[1:21:11.280 --> 1:21:18.000]  war store dot com we have dna force 33 off at infowarstore.com this is an advanced formula

[1:21:35.280 --> 1:21:40.240]  that is why dna force is such an expensive product and so difficult to produce and a 33
[1:21:40.240 --> 1:21:45.840]  percent discount off of that is a massive saving so take advantage of that right now it is something
[1:21:45.840 --> 1:21:50.720]  if you look at the studies that is very important for your health it can have a great deal of benefit

[1:22:35.360 --> 1:22:40.240]  stuff contact poison control we don't want to poison you we've been trying to warn people
[1:22:40.880 --> 1:22:45.200]  and give them water filters so they can filter out the fluoride that is put into the water
[1:22:45.200 --> 1:22:50.720]  source there's been numerous studies showing how that's harmful but iodine is actually very good
[1:22:50.720 --> 1:22:54.240]  and it fights bacteria along with nano silver i don't think you're going to find any other
[1:22:54.240 --> 1:23:01.200]  toothpaste anywhere that has nano silver it's a great way to kill bacteria that cause gum disease

[1:23:28.400 --> 1:23:33.760]  your support let's take a look at what's going on with the pentagon again one of the few legitimate
[1:23:33.760 --> 1:23:39.760]  uses of the federal government under the constitution is to defend the country but even that legitimate
[1:23:39.760 --> 1:23:48.560]  use can be abused if it is taken to extremes and as zero hedge points out the spirit of this country
[1:23:49.200 --> 1:23:56.160]  is totally adverse to a large military force they didn't say that thomas jefferson said that
[1:23:56.160 --> 1:24:02.880]  he said that in a letter he wrote in 1807 but what do we have now we have a global force
[1:24:03.680 --> 1:24:08.640]  to enforce the american empire and as i point out the united states has military personnel
[1:24:08.640 --> 1:24:14.640]  in nearly every country in the world ranging from two liaison officers in fiji to tens of thousands
[1:24:14.640 --> 1:24:19.280]  from all of the service branches in japan and germany according to the report has it made us
[1:24:19.280 --> 1:24:27.360]  safer i don't think so when we are at war in seven different countries i don't know how we
[1:24:27.360 --> 1:24:32.320]  continue to afford that i don't know how that makes us safer i don't know that how that makes us freer
[1:24:32.320 --> 1:24:37.600]  or more prosperous and i say but perhaps the most important and equally absurd part of this is one
[1:24:37.600 --> 1:24:42.640]  considers the original beginnings of our humble republic envisioned by people like madison and
[1:24:42.640 --> 1:24:47.360]  jefferson is the fact that america's worldwide military presence is so big that the pentagon
[1:24:47.360 --> 1:24:53.680]  itself can't track how many us service members are deployed or where this is something that is
[1:24:53.680 --> 1:24:59.760]  coming out of stars and stripes the military newspaper and the headline i said this is not
[1:24:59.760 --> 1:25:06.160]  the onion the headline is report 44 000 unknown military personnel stationed around the world
[1:25:07.440 --> 1:25:11.440]  so the us military has more than 44 000 troops across the globe the pentagon claims it cannot
[1:25:11.440 --> 1:25:17.600]  track according to a recent report they are labeled as unknown and again this is not classified it
[1:25:17.600 --> 1:25:23.040]  isn't like oh we can't tell you where they are they put down unknown and so stars and stripes is
[1:25:23.040 --> 1:25:31.520]  saying uh what's going on here so they they asked some officers about this they said um well uh
[1:25:31.520 --> 1:25:35.760]  we're looking into it they said recent press conferences they've said well we have about
[1:25:35.760 --> 1:25:41.600]  2000 troops in syria but that was four times the previously acknowledged figure so then an army
[1:25:41.600 --> 1:25:46.640]  spokesperson told reporters that 4 000 troops were deployed to syria after which he awkwardly walked
[1:25:46.640 --> 1:25:51.280]  back the statement that less uh less than 30 seconds later saying uh uh i'm sorry i misspoke
[1:25:51.280 --> 1:25:57.920]  there there are approximately 500 in syria so what is it is it 2004 500 they don't really know an army
[1:25:57.920 --> 1:26:03.360]  spokesman talking to stars and stripes said our commitment is to be as transparent as we can
[1:26:03.360 --> 1:26:08.480]  within the constraints of operation security but it's also the case so it's not just classified
[1:26:08.480 --> 1:26:13.440]  stuff it says also the case that the pentagon acknowledged in a statement that it has no
[1:26:13.440 --> 1:26:20.160]  good way to track how many service members are stationed overseas where they are and when they
[1:26:20.160 --> 1:26:25.600]  were there according to stars and stripes there is no one personnel system in the defense department
[1:26:25.600 --> 1:26:31.200]  that tracks a daily location of the personnel so it isn't just oh it's classified and so i
[1:26:31.200 --> 1:26:36.880]  want to look at this and say um you know they're looking at the missing money in 2015 alone they
[1:26:36.880 --> 1:26:42.080]  had a staggering six and a half trillion dollars in funds unaccounted for out of their budget 2.8
[1:26:42.080 --> 1:26:47.920]  trillion of wrongful adjustments occurring in just one quarter somebody should show this report
[1:26:48.800 --> 1:26:54.080]  to um bob corker who said he would not spend another penny uh he would not allow the deficit
[1:26:54.080 --> 1:27:00.480]  to go up by one penny just remind him that uh we've we've got about nine nine and a half trillion
[1:27:00.480 --> 1:27:07.120]  dollars missing here so maybe if he wants to be uh mr fiscal hawk maybe he should start looking at
[1:27:07.120 --> 1:27:10.560]  the defense department but i don't look at these 44 000 soldiers now they don't know where they are
[1:27:10.560 --> 1:27:16.240]  i mean are they like marooned on a japanese island or something since world war two where did they go
[1:27:16.960 --> 1:27:20.000]  they don't know because it's such a big bureaucracy and that's the point
[1:27:21.360 --> 1:27:25.600]  if you want to have better government we're going to have to have smaller government
[1:27:25.600 --> 1:27:31.360]  we're have to go back to a government that's the size of the constitution it isn't going to help us
[1:27:31.360 --> 1:27:39.520]  to have campaign spending limits or federal campaign finance if you've got a black hole
[1:27:39.520 --> 1:27:44.720]  of power and money you are going to draw the most corrupt people and programs into that
[1:27:45.520 --> 1:27:50.160]  and there's nothing you're going to do to stop it no reporting system no system of prohibitions
[1:27:50.160 --> 1:27:56.720]  when you're talking about tens of trillions of dollars to be had by any criminal who gets
[1:27:56.720 --> 1:28:01.920]  influence and peddling in washington dc it's going to happen and no prohibition is going to stop it
[1:28:01.920 --> 1:28:06.000]  the only prohibition is going to stop it is to get the money and the power out of washington
[1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:11.840]  and back to the people to decentralize it that was the original plan the original plan was not
[1:28:11.840 --> 1:28:17.440]  to have us be an occupying force in every country in the world the original plan was for america
[1:28:17.440 --> 1:28:26.480]  to not be an empire the original plan was for citizens to have the ability the training to
[1:28:26.480 --> 1:28:33.520]  defend this country when and if that was necessary and this is an absolute gargantuan distortion
[1:28:33.520 --> 1:28:39.680]  it is like a metastasized cancer and that is every aspect of our government but of course
[1:28:39.680 --> 1:28:46.160]  pentagon especially we see the national defense authorization act always gets passed and they'll
[1:28:46.160 --> 1:28:51.680]  put anything in there and get it passed that's why you see so many corrupt things finding their way

[1:33:29.280 --> 1:33:33.440]  welcome back i'm david and i don't want to be talking to roger stone of course an info wars
[1:33:33.440 --> 1:33:42.160]  contributor you find him on the war room monday through friday that begins at 3 p.m to 6 p.m and
[1:33:42.160 --> 1:33:47.360]  roger is on there pretty much every day aren't you roger i think for one hour but i want to talk
[1:33:47.360 --> 1:33:51.680]  to roger today about a couple of things that are happening because roger always knows what's going on
[1:33:51.680 --> 1:33:58.160]  the inside baseball and washington and he wrote an article for daily color talking about the time
[1:33:58.160 --> 1:34:03.840]  it's time for real net neutrality you know roger when i was talking about the news earlier looking
[1:34:03.840 --> 1:34:09.920]  at the death threats to fcc commissioner pie i mentioned the fact that they shut you down for
[1:34:09.920 --> 1:34:13.760]  nothing and yet these are people saying hey we should sneak up behind him and inject him with
[1:34:13.760 --> 1:34:19.520]  bleach we need to kill him kill his family all that stuff is left up there they put this term
[1:34:19.520 --> 1:34:25.600]  up their net neutrality just like they had the congressional accountability act which provided
[1:34:25.600 --> 1:34:31.200]  a 17 million dollar slush fund to hide the sexual assaults of congressmen we now have this thing
[1:34:31.200 --> 1:34:36.160]  called net neutrality they always they always come up with these wonderful labels because that's the
[1:34:36.160 --> 1:34:43.120]  high ground for their arguments isn't it yeah no it's it's uh as they say bass akward uh it is um
[1:34:44.400 --> 1:34:50.080]  ironic that they have grabbed the moral high ground in this argument let me try to break
[1:34:50.080 --> 1:34:57.520]  this down david the net neutrality rules passed under barack obama are anything but the only
[1:34:57.520 --> 1:35:07.840]  neutrality that they provide for is for the the isp's the service providers comcast verizon at and
[1:35:07.840 --> 1:35:15.680]  t it guarantees their equal access and equal treatment but it leaves untouched the google's the
[1:35:15.680 --> 1:35:23.200]  facebook's the amazon's the twitter's they're free to censor or defame conservative contributors
[1:35:23.200 --> 1:35:31.440]  uh to silence our voices entirely precisely what's happened in my own case now i feel sorry for
[1:35:31.440 --> 1:35:38.560]  agit pi the fcc commissioner because every single day even though i'm still not on twitter
[1:35:38.560 --> 1:35:47.360]  you will find threats to kill me disfigure my wife kill my children kill my grandchildren kill my
[1:35:47.360 --> 1:35:53.760]  dogs go back in time and kill everybody the all of your ancestors exactly yeah that's that's
[1:35:53.760 --> 1:36:02.400]  introductory and those people are not banned they are still very much on twitter so um the new net
[1:36:02.400 --> 1:36:10.800]  neutrality rules provide for real protection of the first amendment and free speech so when you go
[1:36:10.800 --> 1:36:18.240]  online and you see liberals talking about net neutrality that's the last thing they want uh
[1:36:18.240 --> 1:36:27.440]  they want to continue to censor voices like alex jones or info wars bright bar daily caller big
[1:36:27.440 --> 1:36:35.600]  league politics uh they are uh they're manipulating the algorithms they're using a a technique called
[1:36:35.600 --> 1:36:42.960]  shadow banning they are attempting to provide us unequal access to this vibrant and important
[1:36:42.960 --> 1:36:49.680]  media uh the that's right we just had julien assange tweet out today he said the the ai revolution
[1:36:49.680 --> 1:36:55.920]  will not be televised because they will use ai to censor people's speech about what is going on
[1:36:55.920 --> 1:36:59.920]  that's what we're now seeing you're talking about the algorithms uh to censor people and it's what
[1:36:59.920 --> 1:37:06.240]  we saw what was it uh two or three weeks ago when you had the twitter executive going before
[1:37:06.240 --> 1:37:11.040]  congressional testimony and uh giving congressional testimony they said wait a minute we saw this
[1:37:11.040 --> 1:37:15.520]  story from info wars uh why was that there why wasn't that well we took care of that we took it
[1:37:15.520 --> 1:37:20.880]  out well why did it take so long well let's talk about that privately congressman it's out in the
[1:37:20.880 --> 1:37:25.680]  open they're talking about us and others by name this is where the censorship is coming
[1:37:25.680 --> 1:37:31.280]  confirm it's coming from the people who are pushing this so-called net neutrality thank goodness for
[1:37:31.280 --> 1:37:38.160]  the election of donald trump and the appointment and majority of commissioners at the FCC who
[1:37:38.160 --> 1:37:45.680]  understand this issue we are going to strike a blow for freedom here very very shortly yes very
[1:37:45.680 --> 1:37:51.120]  important people understand where that is is coming from and what you know we look at this
[1:37:51.120 --> 1:37:55.840]  and we look at the case that's being argued before the supreme court right now that we've
[1:37:55.840 --> 1:38:00.720]  seen several of these where you have a gay couple come in and say we want a photographer
[1:38:00.720 --> 1:38:06.000]  or we want somebody who's doing a wedding uh to uh to be at our wedding and they say no
[1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:10.720]  i find that offensive that's my personal choice not to do that and they say but you must do that
[1:38:10.720 --> 1:38:17.200]  and yet they don't whatever you think about that particular case why if a small company
[1:38:17.200 --> 1:38:22.160]  an individual local baker or photographer must do this because they have a marketplace here
[1:38:22.160 --> 1:38:27.760]  why aren't those same rules being applied to these massive social media companies uh like
[1:38:27.760 --> 1:38:32.880]  youtube twitter facebook or google itself why aren't those same rules being applied to them
[1:38:32.880 --> 1:38:38.480]  when they have a de facto monopoly why shouldn't they have to evenly serve everybody that's the
[1:38:38.480 --> 1:38:44.640]  the question that i think anybody's asking well it's time for these big internet companies to be
[1:38:44.640 --> 1:38:53.040]  regulated like a utility i mean at&t is a private company but you cannot be denied a telephone look
[1:38:53.040 --> 1:38:59.600]  i'm for individual freedom that's the right to marry anyone you want it's also the right to either
[1:38:59.600 --> 1:39:05.760]  deliver the the wedding cake or not deliver the wedding cake depending on your individual view
[1:39:06.480 --> 1:39:12.640]  i hope both of these things equally if we are for individual personal freedom it must
[1:39:12.640 --> 1:39:19.360]  to extend in this area as well for too long libertarian and conservative voices have been
[1:39:19.360 --> 1:39:27.280]  silenced on the internet we have seen repeatedly the demonetization of youtube videos by
[1:39:27.280 --> 1:39:33.840]  conservative commentators and voices like alex jones and others uh enough is enough uh donald
[1:39:33.840 --> 1:39:40.400]  trump selection is going to allow us to grab back free access of the internet for everyone by the way
[1:39:40.400 --> 1:39:48.240]  right under these rules liberals and progressives could not be censored either i'm for free speech
[1:39:48.240 --> 1:39:54.480]  for everyone david that's right and when we see the mainstream media is we have several times it's
[1:39:54.480 --> 1:39:59.840]  almost a daily occurrence we have some major story where they lie about the data or they
[1:39:59.840 --> 1:40:06.800]  misrepresent it uh saying oh look this came out at uh before president uh trump was elected we had
[1:40:06.800 --> 1:40:11.920]  conversations uh that we've now oh no that happened uh later on and we already knew about that or
[1:40:11.920 --> 1:40:18.320]  just as i did in the last uh a couple of days saying that uh president trump's son was uh
[1:40:19.520 --> 1:40:22.800]  trying to get wiki leaks information and it turns out that it already been
[1:40:22.800 --> 1:40:27.120]  tweeted out a day earlier somebody sent him an email he said i hadn't even seen he said people
[1:40:27.120 --> 1:40:31.680]  are sending me emails all the time but when they put this stuff out and president trump exposes it
[1:40:31.680 --> 1:40:37.600]  and criticizes them for these false attacks they always accuse him of censorship it's not censorship
[1:40:38.640 --> 1:40:44.400]  yeah no look it's laughable the hypocrisy of the left is extraordinary you will remember when
[1:40:44.400 --> 1:40:50.080]  alex jones and i first raised the questions about hillary clinton's health um this wasn't
[1:40:50.080 --> 1:40:56.880]  based on something we'd seen online this is based on our own two eyes you can see her coughing fits
[1:40:56.880 --> 1:41:00.320]  you could see based on her two eyes as well because they were going in different directions at
[1:41:00.320 --> 1:41:06.800]  certain times right right she needed help to get up one flight of stairs yeah uh now suddenly
[1:41:06.800 --> 1:41:13.360]  that was off limits we were we were denounced the clinton campaign attacked alex by name they put out
[1:41:13.360 --> 1:41:19.040]  a written statement accusing me of making the whole thing up now however you see the mainstream
[1:41:19.040 --> 1:41:26.560]  media viciously attacking don trump over his health oh he's sick he's not well he's crazy
[1:41:26.560 --> 1:41:33.600]  he's non-compassmentist that's perfectly all right look this is laughable yeah i predict this on the
[1:41:33.600 --> 1:41:41.280]  alex jones show months ago if muhler uh shoots and misses which i think he certainly shoots
[1:41:41.280 --> 1:41:47.520]  how that plays out we don't know then they will move to the 25th amendment strategy
[1:41:47.520 --> 1:41:55.120]  removing don trump because he's quote unquote crazy which he most certainly is not uh but you see
[1:41:55.120 --> 1:42:04.640]  senator corker you see don limone from cnn you see all these voices uh more and more uh teeth
[1:42:04.640 --> 1:42:08.560]  oberman although i don't know how he tweets from a straight jacket must be interesting
[1:42:09.760 --> 1:42:16.240]  you know this whole idea that trump is uh is not mentally well that's perfectly acceptable
[1:42:16.240 --> 1:42:23.120]  commentary but when we criticized hillary's obviously frail health well we were bully boys
[1:42:23.120 --> 1:42:28.480]  and of course it's the uh it's the vast left-wing conspiracy that they keep repeating over and over
[1:42:28.480 --> 1:42:34.160]  again the the russian conspiracy for which they have no proof whatsoever and they cannot get away
[1:42:34.160 --> 1:42:38.400]  from that that's we're gonna talk about that when we come back want to ask roger stone about a
[1:42:38.400 --> 1:42:43.840]  column that he had about the bad advice that president trump is getting from his lawyers also
[1:42:43.840 --> 1:42:49.680]  want to ask him about the reports that retired cia agents working with blackwater founder
[1:42:49.680 --> 1:42:55.600]  uh claimed that the that hr mcmaster approved the spy job on the trump family won't be right

[1:47:26.880 --> 1:47:32.960]  welcome back i'm david knight and we're talking to roger stone and ask roger about this tweet
[1:47:32.960 --> 1:47:39.920]  that president trump's lawyer john dowd took credit for it a mia culpa it was a head scratcher at the
[1:47:39.920 --> 1:47:45.600]  very least it really got the left fired up it's another one of these uh nothing burgers that they
[1:47:45.600 --> 1:47:51.040]  thought they really had something but it certainly got them talking and the fact that he would word
[1:47:51.040 --> 1:47:55.760]  something like that and precisely and then take credit for saying i had control of the tweets
[1:47:55.760 --> 1:48:00.240]  we're going to talk to roger about that before we do real quickly i remind you of some of the items

[1:48:53.520 --> 1:48:58.480]  roger you've been saying that this tweet that went out saying i had to fire general flinn because
[1:48:58.480 --> 1:49:02.400]  he lied to the vice president and the fbi that was then used by the left to say look this is
[1:49:02.400 --> 1:49:08.080]  obstruction of justice he fired call me because of this and then the attorney his attorney john
[1:49:08.080 --> 1:49:13.760]  dowd came out and said well i wrote that it was sloppy it was very inaccurate i mean what do you
[1:49:13.760 --> 1:49:23.200]  think about his lawyers here i think the president's lawyers are giving him incredibly bad advice i
[1:49:23.200 --> 1:49:31.040]  really don't think they understand the enmity of the deep state and the two-party elite duopoly
[1:49:31.040 --> 1:49:37.280]  that have run this country into the ground they have every intention of removing our president
[1:49:38.080 --> 1:49:44.960]  it is unrealistic for ty cob lawyer who obviously stole his name from a baseball player
[1:49:46.080 --> 1:49:52.000]  tell the president that he will shortly have a letter from Mueller clearing him entirely on the
[1:49:52.000 --> 1:49:59.760]  question of russian collusion i'm telling you that isn't going to happen uh instead i believe the
[1:49:59.760 --> 1:50:06.560]  president's lawyers are sleepwalking him right into the blade uh this this is an extraordinary
[1:50:06.560 --> 1:50:13.440]  mistake the president needs to take uh the muller inquiry more seriously this is a completely
[1:50:13.440 --> 1:50:24.000]  partisan uh uh get trump effort that is not going to stop and that tweet um at least on the face of
[1:50:24.000 --> 1:50:31.760]  it appears to set the president up for an obstruction charge remember previously he told us that flin
[1:50:31.760 --> 1:50:38.320]  was fired because he lied to the vice president now he's suddenly saying no flin was fired because
[1:50:38.320 --> 1:50:47.360]  he lied to the fbi that would of course mean that when he told comey to uh end the flin investigation
[1:50:47.360 --> 1:50:55.360]  he was arguably guilty of obstruction uh so then john dowd dives on the grenade and says no the
[1:50:55.360 --> 1:51:02.720]  president didn't send that i sent it this is not only sloppy but i think it's dangerous the president
[1:51:02.720 --> 1:51:10.960]  needs to get real as i said in the first segment i'm convinced that if muller shoots uh and misses
[1:51:10.960 --> 1:51:18.160]  that there they will then move to a 25th amendment strategy removing trump because they claim he is
[1:51:18.160 --> 1:51:24.320]  non-compassmentist that he is crazy around the ben i've talked to the president he's
[1:51:24.320 --> 1:51:30.720]  just as sharp as he's ever been this is a false narrative being promulgated mostly
[1:51:30.720 --> 1:51:38.880]  by the talking heads on cnn but the political establishment will never rest until they can
[1:51:38.880 --> 1:51:45.280]  negate the results of the last election that's what this is really about and you are not doing the
[1:51:45.280 --> 1:51:53.440]  president a service by uh telling him that he's about to be cleared when in my opinion he is not
[1:51:53.440 --> 1:52:00.320]  now uh the drugs report picked up my interview the new york daily news on this subject last week
[1:52:00.320 --> 1:52:06.160]  for which i am gratified um but i think it's very important that the president's supporters
[1:52:06.640 --> 1:52:13.760]  and the president's friends tell him the truth that his lawyers are leading him down the primrose
[1:52:13.760 --> 1:52:21.920]  path to the gallows i i believe that uh with my entire heart and soul and i am deeply deeply
[1:52:21.920 --> 1:52:27.840]  concerned that they are not getting the muller inquiry seriously enough you know i i think
[1:52:27.840 --> 1:52:32.240]  probably his best defender maybe he needs to get rid of these guys and hire ellen dirshowitz you
[1:52:32.240 --> 1:52:36.320]  know he wrote a book called trumped up he said there's nothing here there isn't any crime he can
[1:52:36.320 --> 1:52:42.560]  fire the fbi director the fbi director works for him under the justice department and he said uh
[1:52:42.560 --> 1:52:47.680]  and so so has uh judge napolitano he says look it's not obstruction if you're not trying to hide
[1:52:47.680 --> 1:52:52.400]  something that is criminal there is no crime here and so the only thing you could say is that hey
[1:52:52.400 --> 1:52:57.360]  i don't like uh i want you to go spend your your time trying to find criminals and terrorists
[1:52:57.360 --> 1:53:02.720]  who are uh trying to do things here in the united states instead of going down this
[1:53:03.360 --> 1:53:08.560]  rabbit trail with this that'd be perfectly legitimate to do and if you feel like the guy
[1:53:08.560 --> 1:53:14.320]  is wasting resources on a political witch hunt it'd be perfectly fine to shut that down as well
[1:53:14.320 --> 1:53:19.520]  because if this isn't about a crime if comey and uh muller and the rest of these people rod
[1:53:19.520 --> 1:53:24.080]  rosinstein if this is a political persecution looking to get something on trump and others
[1:53:24.080 --> 1:53:28.080]  with a process crime they'd be perfectly fine to shut that down there's absolutely no reason
[1:53:28.080 --> 1:53:33.760]  that you couldn't do that well it's obvious from the president's tweets and some of his public
[1:53:33.760 --> 1:53:40.160]  comments that his lawyers have convinced him that it's somehow improper for him to give direction
[1:53:40.160 --> 1:53:45.200]  to the justice department that's false the justice department is an extension of the
[1:53:45.200 --> 1:53:52.880]  executive branch the president has every right to give direct orders to jaff sessions now i personally
[1:53:52.880 --> 1:54:00.640]  am opposed to the idea of firing muller although he certainly merits it because of the uh obvious
[1:54:00.640 --> 1:54:07.040]  mainstream media analogy to the saturday night massacre and richard nixon it's unnecessary
[1:54:07.040 --> 1:54:15.040]  david the president needs to direct jeff session give him a direct order appoint a special prosecutor
[1:54:15.040 --> 1:54:22.400]  in the matter of uranium one that would immediately entail a federal investigation of mr
[1:54:22.400 --> 1:54:31.360]  muller the former fbi director mr comey the former fbi director assistant fbi director andrew mccabe
[1:54:32.000 --> 1:54:39.360]  and the supervising u.s attorney and the uranium one matter rod rosinstein that's right the whole
[1:54:39.360 --> 1:54:46.320]  groups if those four gentlemen are under federal investigation by a special prosecutor say
[1:54:46.320 --> 1:54:53.680]  andrew mccarthy or judge andrew napolitano or tray galley or some other honest broker
[1:54:53.680 --> 1:55:02.160]  well they cannot possibly continue to function uh in this get trump brigade that is the special
[1:55:02.160 --> 1:55:10.240]  council um it is interesting that as soon as i propose this within minutes literally vanity fair
[1:55:10.240 --> 1:55:17.360]  and uh raw story the worst of the worst left-wing fake news sites we're out with stories saying
[1:55:17.360 --> 1:55:23.440]  why the president should not and could not do this that's how i know it's exactly the right thing
[1:55:24.160 --> 1:55:29.280]  oh i think that would be a genius move because again he doesn't have to make it look as if it's
[1:55:29.280 --> 1:55:33.760]  they're going to argue obstruction if he tries to fire uh muller even though he has the authority
[1:55:33.760 --> 1:55:38.880]  even though there isn't any special prosecutor law that was allowed to expire in 1999 we don't even
[1:55:38.880 --> 1:55:43.280]  know the rules under which the special prosecutor is operating because there is no law and so
[1:55:43.280 --> 1:55:49.280]  there isn't any process actually david we do know he's operating under no rules that's right yeah
[1:55:49.280 --> 1:55:55.600]  they won't declare it yeah under the old special prosecutor law expanding the scope of his probe
[1:55:55.600 --> 1:56:01.680]  requires the written permission of the attorney general this guy does anything he wants that's
[1:56:01.680 --> 1:56:06.000]  right stunning and there was oversight by three judges and so forth none of that stuff applies
[1:56:06.000 --> 1:56:11.520]  anymore he's just that's what everybody wishes and the most chilling piece of information this week
[1:56:11.520 --> 1:56:17.440]  is the fact that the special prosecutor has subpoenaed the deuchess bank records into the
[1:56:17.440 --> 1:56:23.680]  300 million dollar portfolio of real estate developments by donald trump yes what does
[1:56:23.680 --> 1:56:30.400]  this have to do with russian collusion nothing whatsoever it's a witch hunt it's time for mr
[1:56:30.400 --> 1:56:38.800]  muller and mr comey and mr mccabe and mr rozenstein it's their time in the barrel so to speak if you
[1:56:38.800 --> 1:56:43.760]  want to get a process crime against somebody the easiest way to do it first of all is to have a
[1:56:43.760 --> 1:56:48.560]  surprised deposition on them and say oh you lied on some of the details this is what they did to flint
[1:56:48.560 --> 1:56:53.680]  but the next easiest thing to do is financial crimes because it is so complex and there's so
[1:56:53.680 --> 1:56:58.240]  many different rules and regulations and it's subject to interpretation as anybody who has
[1:56:58.240 --> 1:57:03.600]  looked at the irs rules know it is far more complicated with these international rules
[1:57:03.600 --> 1:57:08.720]  and that's ultimately what they're after i think your strategy is exactly what needs to happen
[1:57:08.720 --> 1:57:14.800]  roger son the idea that that they would start to investigate uranium one which is where all of
[1:57:14.800 --> 1:57:20.080]  these people running this thing without any oversight without any rules without any law
[1:57:20.080 --> 1:57:25.040]  they were all involved in uranium one well that's it for today's broadcast thank you again roger for
