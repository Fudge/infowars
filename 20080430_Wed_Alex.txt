[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:03.311]  It is April 30th, 2008 on this Live Wednesday Transmission.
[00:00:28.758 --> 00:00:36.605]  So much is happening in the world that I was chomping at the bit waking up early this morning wanting to come into work.
[00:00:36.605 --> 00:00:40.388]  No brag, just fact, I did nine hours of radio.
[00:00:40.388 --> 00:00:44.072]  Four hours and ten minutes on my own show.
[00:00:44.072 --> 00:00:50.477]  An hour on a BBC debate with so-called 9-11 debunkers.
[00:00:50.477 --> 00:00:53.560]  Three hours on the Raleigh James syndicated radio show.
[00:00:54.665 --> 00:01:03.657]  Another 30 minutes on another radio broadcast, and 30 minutes on Coast to Coast AM at 2 AM Central Standard Time.
[00:01:03.657 --> 00:01:09.425]  And I'm like the jack-in-the-box popping out of his box this morning, ready to go.
[00:01:11.184 --> 00:01:15.446]  And it's not because I don't want a vacation or I don't want to sleep or I wouldn't normally be tired.
[00:01:15.446 --> 00:01:17.206]  I am in survival mode.
[00:01:17.206 --> 00:01:22.948]  I instinctively and intellectually know that we are in very serious waters.
[00:01:22.948 --> 00:01:33.052]  And that's why I will go anywhere, anytime to get the word out and we'll burn the midnight oil to warn the people about what is happening.
[00:01:33.052 --> 00:01:37.234]  I could spend all day on this and I'm told Paul Watson did record the hour
[00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:41.290]  I only got to talk for maybe eight minutes of the hour.
[00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:49.713]  It was five to one on the BBC, and I totally destroyed them.
[00:01:49.713 --> 00:01:51.973]  Destroyed them!
[00:01:51.973 --> 00:01:54.994]  And so they were fading me down and trying to dominate me.
[00:01:54.994 --> 00:01:56.855]  We need to post that.
[00:01:56.855 --> 00:01:57.975]  I know Paul recorded it.
[00:01:57.975 --> 00:02:05.258]  I didn't see an article about it this morning, but I do want to just point out a few of the things that happened on that to illustrate the debunkers.
[00:02:07.938 --> 00:02:12.502]  And how they operate, but I cleaned their clock 5 to 1.
[00:02:12.502 --> 00:02:15.405]  5 to 1!
[00:02:15.405 --> 00:02:18.067]  That's how cowardly the establishment is.
[00:02:18.067 --> 00:02:20.309]  Soon they'll just stop debating us, period.
[00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:23.712]  They already shrink from it.
[00:02:23.712 --> 00:02:30.778]  It's just 5 to 1, and I just crush them, absolutely smash them into the ground, and that's because
[00:02:34.364 --> 00:02:35.405]  I have the information.
[00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:36.265]  We tell the truth.
[00:02:36.265 --> 00:02:36.986]  We have the facts.
[00:02:36.986 --> 00:02:38.326]  We have history on our side.
[00:02:38.326 --> 00:02:43.249]  It's not this hillbilly from Texas.
[00:02:43.249 --> 00:02:52.955]  This stump-jumping, tobacco-chewing, fiddle-playing... That's a little nod to Willie Nelson.
[00:02:52.955 --> 00:02:54.655]  He just had his birthday a couple days ago.
[00:02:54.655 --> 00:02:57.157]  I forgot to plug that.
[00:02:57.157 --> 00:02:58.918]  Maybe I ought to call Willie up, have him back on the show.
[00:03:00.134 --> 00:03:03.675]  We do have a big guest coming up next month, confirmed.
[00:03:03.675 --> 00:03:04.195]  Very big.
[00:03:04.195 --> 00:03:08.336]  Not Willie Nelson, you'll see.
[00:03:08.336 --> 00:03:10.617]  People say, who cares that we have celebrities on the show?
[00:03:10.617 --> 00:03:14.398]  Well, the point is, the mainstream media does.
[00:03:14.398 --> 00:03:24.721]  And it shows their courage, and so other people, physicists and scientists and Italian presidents and former German defense ministers, then have the courage to go public.
[00:03:24.721 --> 00:03:26.502]  See, that's why it's important.
[00:03:26.502 --> 00:03:29.883]  Plus, Willie Nelson and Jesse Ventura and Charlie Sheen and
[00:03:30.763 --> 00:03:34.604]  All these other individuals and congressmen, they're pretty cool.
[00:03:34.604 --> 00:03:41.165]  You know, they're well-known and famous because they're interesting people.
[00:03:41.165 --> 00:03:44.926]  But I'm already digressing here.
[00:03:44.926 --> 00:03:47.446]  There is just so much news today.
[00:03:47.446 --> 00:03:55.648]  I had a lady who had lived inside the spinoff of the Mormon Church with the hundreds of kids grabbed and
[00:03:56.707 --> 00:03:58.008]  What the government's doing is wrong.
[00:03:58.008 --> 00:03:59.669]  Due process is being ignored.
[00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:00.910]  Guilty until proven innocent.
[00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.131]  Family courts.
[00:04:02.131 --> 00:04:02.951]  Not real courts.
[00:04:02.951 --> 00:04:05.893]  But at the same time, I don't agree with the group and it looks pretty bad.
[00:04:05.893 --> 00:04:06.434]  Doesn't matter.
[00:04:06.434 --> 00:04:07.334]  They get due process.
[00:04:07.334 --> 00:04:08.655]  Well, no, they don't.
[00:04:08.655 --> 00:04:16.120]  And the government's setting the precedent to violate everybody's due process and selling us on this using Waco and now this event.
[00:04:19.517 --> 00:04:23.938]  I was going to have her on today, but I just moved her to next week because I got so much happening.
[00:04:23.938 --> 00:04:30.260]  We've got a former government analyst and expert on the banking system and the economy for two hours, Richard C. Cook.
[00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:39.623]  We have Dr. Lynn Horowitz coming on, tying it in with Reverend Jeremiah Wright saying, have you read, you know, Lynn Horowitz's work, Dr. Horowitz's work.
[00:04:39.623 --> 00:04:41.904]  So we'll talk with Horowitz for an hour.
[00:04:42.612 --> 00:04:51.039]  In this hour, though, I'm gonna try, I said try, to move fast and cover this giant stack of news I have, play some audio clips, some incredible info.
[00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:54.522]  It's totally jam-packed!
[00:04:54.522 --> 00:04:55.944]  It is a big idea.
[00:04:55.944 --> 00:04:58.766]  A new world order.
[00:04:58.766 --> 00:05:03.670]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.493]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:05:06.493 --> 00:05:08.695]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:05:09.281 --> 00:05:12.445]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:05:12.445 --> 00:05:19.773]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:22.799 --> 00:05:28.243]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:28.243 --> 00:05:32.125]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:05:32.125 --> 00:05:34.687]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:05:34.687 --> 00:05:35.848]  Most people have no idea.
[00:05:35.848 --> 00:05:36.628]  They're not after money.
[00:05:36.628 --> 00:05:37.909]  They have all the money they need.
[00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:38.890]  They're after power.
[00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:40.031]  That's what they're after these years.
[00:05:40.031 --> 00:05:44.794]  Order In Game on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[00:05:48.756 --> 00:05:51.558]  In Game, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:05:51.558 --> 00:05:52.619]  You have been warned.
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:58.703]  You can trace every disease, every illness, and every ailment to mineral deficiency.
[00:05:58.703 --> 00:06:02.586]  That is a quote from two-time Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling.
[00:06:02.586 --> 00:06:12.272]  Because fruits and vegetables in their raw form are better absorbed, retained, and utilized than if heated, the Champion Juicer is the best way to get your nutrients your body craves.
[00:06:12.272 --> 00:06:16.675]  The Champion Juicer chews the fibers and breaks up the cells of vegetables and fruits.
[00:06:16.675 --> 00:06:20.318]  This gives you more fiber, enzymes, vitamins, and trace minerals.
[00:06:20.498 --> 00:06:30.804]  Juicing a combination of raw fruits and vegetables is documented to not only treat minor illness, but also is shown to reverse once thought incurable, life-threatening diseases.
[00:06:30.804 --> 00:06:35.907]  Juicing with the Champion Juicer also promotes fast, healthy weight loss and pure body cleansing.
[00:06:35.907 --> 00:06:38.609]  Put the Champion Juicer to work for you and your family.
[00:06:38.769 --> 00:06:43.453]  Get creative with your juicer and add a grain mill attachment to make your own healthy, fresh flour.
[00:06:43.453 --> 00:06:47.677]  The Champion Juicer also makes great nut butters and frozen sorbets.
[00:06:47.677 --> 00:06:50.359]  The world's finest juicer is Champion Juicer.
[00:06:50.359 --> 00:06:53.182]  Ask for it at your favorite health food store online today.
[00:06:53.182 --> 00:06:57.686]  If you've ever wanted to grow the absolute best tasting fruits and vegetables imaginable, here's some exciting news.
[00:06:57.686 --> 00:07:00.549]  There's a new product designed to make growing delicious produce easy.
[00:07:00.549 --> 00:07:00.929]  It's called
[00:07:01.049 --> 00:07:03.170]  Proto-Gro, and it's dynamite in the garden.
[00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:10.193]  Proto-Gro is a bioactive superfood for plants that works by providing true broad-spectrum nutrition, allowing plants to achieve their full genetic expression.
[00:07:10.193 --> 00:07:11.393]  What does this mean in the garden?
[00:07:11.393 --> 00:07:16.075]  It means mouth-watering fruits and vegetables, brilliantly colored flowers, herbs that finally grow to medicinal strength.
[00:07:16.235 --> 00:07:22.778]  Blue Ribbon Garden Produce, jam-packed with bioavailable minerals and trace elements, giant pumpkins, even high-potency, high-bricks wheatgrass.
[00:07:22.778 --> 00:07:25.960]  Proto-Gro is a proprietary blend of full-spectrum nutrients from the sea.
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.781]  It literally contains the basic building blocks of life itself.
[00:07:28.781 --> 00:07:36.065]  In fact, Proto-Gro is so effective at producing rapid plant growth in record time that it almost forces plants to grow, even under the worst light and soil conditions.
[00:07:36.065 --> 00:07:38.706]  It's also perfect for growing your own survival foods and mites.
[00:07:38.746 --> 00:07:39.987]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:07:39.987 --> 00:07:41.809]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:23.281 --> 00:08:28.504]  Secretary of Defense Gates says second carrier in Gulf is reminder to Iran.
[00:08:28.504 --> 00:08:37.551]  I was listening to local Fox News at ready to go on Coast to Coast AM last night listening to KLBJ 590, one of my local affiliates.
[00:08:38.465 --> 00:08:44.926]  And I was listening to Fox News, and it said Gates is doing this as a reminder, but not as a threat.
[00:08:44.926 --> 00:08:53.928]  I mean, the doublespeak is just unbelievable here, and there is a lot of signs and indicators they are getting ready to attack Iran.
[00:08:53.928 --> 00:08:54.648]  Either the U.S.
[00:08:54.648 --> 00:08:56.469]  or Israel, or both.
[00:08:56.469 --> 00:09:00.509]  And then if Iran fights back in any way, Israel has said they will nuke them.
[00:09:00.509 --> 00:09:01.630]  You gotta love that.
[00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:03.150]  You are the Nazis!
[00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:07.871]  When we bomb you, thousands of sites, as we publicly say we've already targeted years ago,
[00:09:09.015 --> 00:09:13.057]  Um, if you fight back in any way, you will be nuked!
[00:09:13.057 --> 00:09:15.439]  How dare I rant so they might fight back?
[00:09:15.439 --> 00:09:16.599]  It's incredible!
[00:09:16.599 --> 00:09:18.901]  It's unbelievable!
[00:09:18.901 --> 00:09:22.963]  It's... I mean, it is the most brainwashed population I've ever seen.
[00:09:24.506 --> 00:09:27.249]  I mean, the absurdity of all of this.
[00:09:27.249 --> 00:09:37.058]  And let's give up all our rights and have millions of boaters and millions of truck drivers and school teachers and everyone running around, Al-Qaeda, it's everywhere!
[00:09:37.058 --> 00:09:39.640]  Give up all your freedoms, we've got to have martial law!
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.962]  The Al-Qaeda!
[00:09:41.962 --> 00:09:43.023]  But the border is wide open.
[00:09:45.808 --> 00:09:49.892]  I mean, it's just crazier and crazier and more absurd.
[00:09:49.892 --> 00:09:57.618]  On the surface, I mean, the official reasons they say they're doing all this is just absolutely ridiculous.
[00:09:57.618 --> 00:10:04.044]  You'd have to be a blithering idiot on 10 gallons of PCP to even believe any of it.
[00:10:06.132 --> 00:10:10.535]  Just off the charts, but if you know the truth, it all makes perfect sense.
[00:10:10.535 --> 00:10:20.142]  Diabolical terrorists run the government, they've attacked us as a pretext to get us to give up our liberties, and as a smokescreen to have a militarized clampdown.
[00:10:20.142 --> 00:10:28.828]  And lo and behold, Rand Corporation and PNAC and scores of others, CFR, have all written white papers about how they were going to do it, and they've done it.
[00:10:29.938 --> 00:10:40.166]  The same paradigm in every other nation where the military interest and the financial interest go ahead and overthrow the nation, to have dictatorial power, to steal land and property from the general public.
[00:10:40.166 --> 00:10:43.729]  And always saying they're doing it because they're fighting an outside enemy.
[00:10:43.729 --> 00:10:51.375]  I mean, the Roman emperors were always going to start some little war and then say, how dare you say I can't take your property and freedom and make you pay more taxes?
[00:10:51.375 --> 00:10:58.641]  We're fighting the vicious Vandals right now in Germania!
[00:10:58.641 --> 00:10:59.262]  You must!
[00:11:00.111 --> 00:11:06.414]  DEFEND THE REPUBLIC FROM THE ENEMY!
[00:11:06.414 --> 00:11:12.597]  So, that's what we're dealing with.
[00:11:12.597 --> 00:11:18.479]  So... Well, I said I'd move fast and I just got into one article and went into a diatribe.
[00:11:18.479 --> 00:11:22.741]  Uh, Gates says second carrier in Gulf is reminder to Iran.
[00:11:22.741 --> 00:11:24.402]  Hmm.
[00:11:24.402 --> 00:11:27.263]  Permanent wars for oil and permanent terrorism.
[00:11:28.536 --> 00:11:29.837]  Another article I want to cover.
[00:11:29.837 --> 00:11:32.238]  The Iraq War morphs into the Iran War.
[00:11:32.238 --> 00:11:33.979]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:11:33.979 --> 00:11:40.764]  One of the most powerful articles ever written by Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former head of policy at the Treasury.
[00:11:40.764 --> 00:11:44.426]  An amazing story out of the Times of London today.
[00:11:44.426 --> 00:11:51.891]  Rockefellers urge action on climate change, and then they admit that the Rockefellers own Standard Oil.
[00:11:51.891 --> 00:11:53.051]  You know it as Exxon Mobil.
[00:11:53.051 --> 00:11:54.212]  They never got rid of it.
[00:11:54.212 --> 00:11:57.334]  That's only two divisions of twelve they own.
[00:11:58.255 --> 00:12:02.897]  They have fully, close to 90% of world oil production under their control.
[00:12:02.897 --> 00:12:19.666]  That's right, the Dutch Rochelle, which is joint-owned by the Rockefellers, the Queen of the Netherlands, and Queen Elizabeth, is only about 12-14%, depending on which number you look at, of it, so it's all them!
[00:12:19.666 --> 00:12:23.668]  And they admit here that they own it, but that's secret, you're not allowed to see that, because they're special.
[00:12:25.057 --> 00:12:30.521]  Everybody else, politicians, myself, you, everybody else, our info is public.
[00:12:30.521 --> 00:12:32.983]  It can be published anytime the media wants to go dig it up.
[00:12:32.983 --> 00:12:38.307]  But not the loving government owner, David Rockefeller.
[00:12:38.307 --> 00:12:52.939]  Rockefeller's urged action on climate change, and they're talking about firing the head of Exxon Mobil, or removing him, because it says the family's mad that the board chairman hasn't followed their orders to push for a global tax.
[00:12:55.672 --> 00:12:58.614]  Because they're not going to just sell us the oil and have artificial scarcity.
[00:12:58.614 --> 00:13:00.675]  They're also going to tax us on top of it.
[00:13:00.675 --> 00:13:03.816]  Vacuum may be the latest weapon against global warming.
[00:13:03.816 --> 00:13:04.797]  You can't make this up.
[00:13:04.797 --> 00:13:06.998]  This is KCBS-TV.
[00:13:06.998 --> 00:13:15.162]  It says the government wants to, and one physicist wants to, build giant vacuum cleaners that suck up deadly carbon dioxide.
[00:13:15.162 --> 00:13:16.763]  You can't make this up.
[00:13:17.509 --> 00:13:20.931]  Gas that's been 14 times higher from ice core studies.
[00:13:20.931 --> 00:13:22.132]  Plants grow better.
[00:13:22.132 --> 00:13:23.212]  They put out more oxygen.
[00:13:23.212 --> 00:13:24.133]  Humans are healthier.
[00:13:24.133 --> 00:13:25.413]  All animals are healthier.
[00:13:25.413 --> 00:13:28.455]  The Earth is in a carbon dioxide starved mode.
[00:13:28.455 --> 00:13:34.338]  The lowest, for some reason, than what in thousands and thousands of years, hundreds of thousands, the ice cores show.
[00:13:34.338 --> 00:13:35.439]  We need it.
[00:13:35.439 --> 00:13:37.500]  But they've convinced people.
[00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:42.162]  Just like you can go to a crowd of people and say, Sodium chloride.
[00:13:42.162 --> 00:13:43.443]  I'm gonna make you drink it.
[00:13:44.165 --> 00:13:47.087]  People will say, no, not sodium chloride!
[00:13:47.087 --> 00:13:50.249]  Please don't!
[00:13:50.249 --> 00:13:52.830]  It's salt, table salt.
[00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:58.714]  Just like you can give somebody the scientific name for water and they'll beg you not to make them drink it.
[00:13:58.714 --> 00:14:02.436]  Should we ban sodium chloride?
[00:14:02.436 --> 00:14:03.657]  Yes, ban it immediately.
[00:14:03.657 --> 00:14:04.337]  It's table salt.
[00:14:08.553 --> 00:14:09.074]  Doesn't matter.
[00:14:09.074 --> 00:14:18.903]  See, that's when you have a mindless, gibbering public that only thinks about the next party or the next way to act cool, the next style augmentation.
[00:14:18.903 --> 00:14:20.365]  You get enslaved.
[00:14:20.365 --> 00:14:26.310]  Bad men that are smart and hungry and want power come!
[00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:29.694]  And they tell you, don't worry, we're going to tax your individual footprint.
[00:14:29.694 --> 00:14:31.816]  We're going to regulate your life.
[00:14:31.816 --> 00:14:32.857]  We're going to control you.
[00:14:37.836 --> 00:14:42.477]  And we're going to take the gas you exhale and make it a toxic waste.
[00:14:42.477 --> 00:14:49.419]  In the words of the chairman of the CFR, making, quote, humanity the enemy and the state will direct operations against the new enemy.
[00:14:49.419 --> 00:15:04.344]  The people, the entire attack profile, the entire mechanism of anti-terror and environmentalism is about making you a slave and euthanizing you and one-child policies and sterilizing everybody.
[00:15:04.344 --> 00:15:04.744]  Publicly.
[00:15:07.073 --> 00:15:14.137]  You think the billionaires give 80 plus percent of all their savings to eugenics programs because they're not serious?
[00:15:14.137 --> 00:15:16.298]  Bill and Melinda Gates over 80 billion?
[00:15:16.298 --> 00:15:17.339]  With Warren Buffett?
[00:15:17.339 --> 00:15:20.521]  You think they want to play tiddly-winks with you?
[00:15:20.521 --> 00:15:25.023]  They've already put it in your water because they've got the power and they've got the will.
[00:15:25.023 --> 00:15:27.525]  And they're gonna put poison in your water.
[00:15:27.525 --> 00:15:32.768]  Oh yes, they're gonna do what they want until you wake up to it and stop being children!
[00:15:32.768 --> 00:15:34.809]  I'm talking to you, police!
[00:15:34.809 --> 00:15:36.410]  You like being poisoned by them, don't you?
[00:15:37.719 --> 00:15:42.062]  Vacuum may be latest weapon against global warming.
[00:15:42.062 --> 00:15:45.945]  Giant vacuums may be able to remove carbon dioxide from the air.
[00:15:45.945 --> 00:15:52.709]  According to Columbia University physicists, vacuums placed around the world could turn back the clock, leaving a pure atmosphere.
[00:15:52.709 --> 00:15:55.992]  A pure atmosphere?
[00:15:55.992 --> 00:15:58.233]  What does that mean?
[00:15:58.233 --> 00:16:01.996]  To rival the pre-industrial age, said physicist Klaus Lackner.
[00:16:02.975 --> 00:16:05.696]  Lackner's prototype vacuum is about the size of a phone booth.
[00:16:05.696 --> 00:16:08.237]  It would capture 10 pounds of carbon dioxide per day.
[00:16:08.237 --> 00:16:11.078]  About 28 million tons are produced worldwide each year.
[00:16:11.078 --> 00:16:12.018]  Oh my God!
[00:16:12.018 --> 00:16:13.219]  Carbon dioxide!
[00:16:13.219 --> 00:16:14.579]  Help me!
[00:16:14.579 --> 00:16:19.921]  It's estimated you could have to cover an area the size of Arizona with vacuums to get the job done.
[00:16:19.921 --> 00:16:26.004]  The cost of 5.6 trillion.
[00:16:26.004 --> 00:16:30.745]  McCain accused of accepting improper donations from Rothschilds.
[00:16:30.745 --> 00:16:32.426]  He's also called for a world government
[00:16:37.285 --> 00:16:46.013]  I remember two months ago, he went to England, Hillary went to another Rothschild event, and they gave him hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[00:16:46.013 --> 00:16:48.495]  It's on its face, completely illegal.
[00:16:48.495 --> 00:16:57.464]  It's like going up to a cop and shooting someone in the head in front of them for no reason.
[00:16:57.464 --> 00:16:58.865]  I mean, there's no debate, it's illegal.
[00:16:59.469 --> 00:17:01.710]  It is illegal to go to a foreign country.
[00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:04.212]  It's illegal to get money from foreigners.
[00:17:04.212 --> 00:17:09.714]  It's illegal to go to a foreign country and have a fundraiser.
[00:17:09.714 --> 00:17:15.217]  In fact, the numbers of the money he was given will be illegal in this country by citizens.
[00:17:15.217 --> 00:17:15.918]  He doesn't care.
[00:17:15.918 --> 00:17:21.161]  He just goes and has a public meeting with the Rothschilds.
[00:17:21.161 --> 00:17:22.521]  Thousands of dollars per play.
[00:17:22.521 --> 00:17:22.781]  What was it?
[00:17:22.781 --> 00:17:23.102]  $10,000 per play?
[00:17:26.502 --> 00:17:28.223]  Tickets to the event were $1,000 and $2,300.
[00:17:28.223 --> 00:17:33.206]  I'd read a thing months ago saying some of the tickets were $10,000 to be at the table with him, but it doesn't matter.
[00:17:33.206 --> 00:17:38.109]  The point is, he raises all this money with, quote, Lord Rothschild.
[00:17:38.109 --> 00:17:43.472]  I remember talking about Rothschild 12 years ago, and I'd get emails and calls going, that doesn't exist.
[00:17:43.472 --> 00:17:46.694]  That's code word for hate.
[00:17:46.694 --> 00:17:48.074]  Rockefellers own nothing.
[00:17:48.074 --> 00:17:50.576]  Rothschilds don't exist.
[00:17:50.576 --> 00:17:52.397]  Rush Limbaugh would say the CFR didn't exist.
[00:17:53.177 --> 00:18:05.644]  Just like we have Gary Hart on video saying, I never called for a new world order, then we play the clip for him, and he says, well, what I meant was... And then they say, hey, here's your letter you published to Iran, saying that the U.S.
[00:18:05.644 --> 00:18:06.405]  would stage attacks.
[00:18:06.405 --> 00:18:08.026]  He said, I never wrote that, how dare you?
[00:18:08.026 --> 00:18:10.307]  They pull the letter out and he goes, oh yes, I did write that.
[00:18:10.307 --> 00:18:14.749]  And then he goes into full detail about it.
[00:18:14.749 --> 00:18:19.132]  You see, they talk to you like you are six months old.
[00:18:20.803 --> 00:18:21.403]  And you know what?
[00:18:21.403 --> 00:18:22.384]  It works on most people.
[00:18:22.384 --> 00:18:25.526]  They've got most people running around going, Oh my God!
[00:18:25.526 --> 00:18:27.827]  Carbon Dioxide!
[00:18:27.827 --> 00:18:30.588]  It's gonna kill my baby!
[00:18:30.588 --> 00:18:31.769]  It's deadly!
[00:18:31.769 --> 00:18:33.650]  Help me!
[00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:35.971]  Oh my God!
[00:18:35.971 --> 00:18:37.732]  Carbon Dioxide!
[00:18:37.732 --> 00:18:39.913]  We're all dead!
[00:18:39.913 --> 00:18:41.754]  I've gotta have a global tax!
[00:18:41.754 --> 00:18:43.175]  Regulate my life!
[00:18:43.175 --> 00:18:44.176]  Take my light bulbs!
[00:18:44.176 --> 00:18:45.396]  Inspect my house!
[00:18:45.396 --> 00:18:47.117]  Save me!
[00:18:47.117 --> 00:18:48.338]  Oh, please!
[00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:55.211]  I'm not worried about human chimera crosses with cows and spiders.
[00:18:55.211 --> 00:19:02.212]  I'm not worried about genetic engineering spreading everywhere and GMO funguses killing all the oak trees.
[00:19:02.212 --> 00:19:04.993]  I'm not worried about the ocean dying right now.
[00:19:04.993 --> 00:19:12.874]  You know, 90 plus percent fish die off from toxic waste dumping and burning down rainforests and all the real environmental things.
[00:19:12.874 --> 00:19:16.075]  Just tax CO2 right now!
[00:19:16.075 --> 00:19:16.435]  Please!
[00:19:17.792 --> 00:19:19.112]  Save me!
[00:19:19.112 --> 00:19:20.453]  It's so deadly!
[00:19:20.453 --> 00:19:26.874]  I mean, that's their attitude?
[00:19:26.874 --> 00:19:29.215]  It's horrible!
[00:19:29.215 --> 00:19:30.815]  Men in black uniforms!
[00:19:30.815 --> 00:19:32.995]  Save me!
[00:19:32.995 --> 00:19:34.536]  Regulate my whole life!
[00:19:34.536 --> 00:19:36.196]  Make me the enemy!
[00:19:36.196 --> 00:19:37.296]  Humans are bad!
[00:19:37.296 --> 00:19:39.157]  Sterilize me!
[00:19:39.157 --> 00:19:42.117]  Oh, the Earth is dying!
[00:19:42.117 --> 00:19:43.738]  Oh, David Rockefeller!
[00:19:43.738 --> 00:19:44.678]  Save me!
[00:19:44.678 --> 00:19:45.258]  Oh, please!
[00:19:46.263 --> 00:19:55.466]  We'll be right back, getting today to Rockefeller, owner of almost all the oil companies.
[00:19:55.466 --> 00:19:58.147]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:19:58.147 --> 00:20:07.630]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:14.713]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:15.433 --> 00:20:21.419]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:20:21.419 --> 00:20:32.209]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:33.411]  It is a big idea.
[00:20:33.411 --> 00:20:34.371]  A new world order.
[00:20:34.371 --> 00:20:35.712]  In the near future.
[00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:03.801]  The Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:21:03.801 --> 00:21:06.643]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:21:06.643 --> 00:21:09.424]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:21:09.424 --> 00:21:12.605]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:21:12.605 --> 00:21:19.929]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:21:22.967 --> 00:21:28.411]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:21:28.411 --> 00:21:32.293]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:21:32.293 --> 00:21:34.835]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:21:34.835 --> 00:21:36.016]  Most people have no idea.
[00:21:36.016 --> 00:21:36.796]  They're not after money.
[00:21:36.796 --> 00:21:38.077]  They have all the money they need.
[00:21:38.077 --> 00:21:39.058]  They're after power.
[00:21:39.058 --> 00:21:40.199]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[00:21:40.199 --> 00:21:48.924]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[00:21:51.726 --> 00:21:52.787]  You have been warned.
[00:21:52.927 --> 00:21:53.828]  Yeah.
[00:21:53.828 --> 00:21:56.929]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:21:56.929 --> 00:22:02.453]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:22:02.453 --> 00:22:08.156]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:22:08.156 --> 00:22:09.637]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:22:09.637 --> 00:22:18.642]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[00:22:18.962 --> 00:22:20.804]  Now compare a Calvin Pure Soap.

[00:23:03.684 --> 00:23:05.444]  America, freedom to fascism.

[00:24:20.495 --> 00:24:24.958]  Someone who cares.
[00:24:24.958 --> 00:24:29.882]  Your own personal Jesus.
[00:24:30.819 --> 00:24:33.041]  Try this for yourself.
[00:24:33.041 --> 00:24:37.524]  Go with your co-workers today.
[00:24:37.524 --> 00:24:41.387]  Type water into Google.
[00:24:41.387 --> 00:24:43.928]  It'll show you Encyclopedia Britannica, Wikipedia.
[00:24:43.928 --> 00:24:47.511]  Print it off so you have the facts so they won't believe you.
[00:24:47.511 --> 00:24:52.715]  That's how superstitious and ignorant, like lobotomized monkeys, the general public is.
[00:24:53.757 --> 00:24:58.460]  I'm not being mean here, just you need to admit how pathetic you are, mainstream people.
[00:24:58.460 --> 00:24:59.901]  And stop being con.
[00:24:59.901 --> 00:25:13.190]  You're like somebody who lets a con artist rip you off thousands of times and we're going, don't let him rip you off, don't let him rip you off, don't let him push you around, and you smile at us with your mindless smile and go, shut up, conspiracy theorist.
[00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:15.512]  I don't have to be involved in anything in society.
[00:25:15.512 --> 00:25:16.833]  There's no evil.
[00:25:16.833 --> 00:25:19.234]  I just need to suck my thumb.
[00:25:19.234 --> 00:25:21.316]  Well, that's why your gas is going up.
[00:25:21.316 --> 00:25:23.077]  That's why your future is totally fried.
[00:25:24.016 --> 00:25:27.017]  This is an emergency situation.
[00:25:27.017 --> 00:25:30.137]  We don't have time for you to be in denial anymore.
[00:25:30.137 --> 00:25:32.237]  Now, do this experiment today.
[00:25:32.237 --> 00:25:32.878]  You're at work.
[00:25:32.878 --> 00:25:37.618]  Do this with your idiot co-workers.
[00:25:37.618 --> 00:25:38.919]  But first, have the proof for them.
[00:25:38.919 --> 00:25:40.299]  In fact, they won't even believe Wikipedia.
[00:25:40.299 --> 00:25:41.839]  That's how superstitious they are.
[00:25:41.839 --> 00:25:43.419]  They only know to mistrust information.
[00:25:43.419 --> 00:25:44.840]  They don't know information.
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:47.580]  So give them Britannica.
[00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:49.900]  It's got a thistle as its symbol.
[00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:53.361]  And walk up and say, hey folks, have you heard they're talking about restricting and regulating
[00:25:54.665 --> 00:25:56.466]  Dihydrogen monoxide?
[00:25:56.466 --> 00:25:58.906]  Uh, what do you think about that?
[00:25:58.906 --> 00:26:01.107]  Do you think they need to control things like that?
[00:26:01.107 --> 00:26:03.928]  Of course they do!
[00:26:03.928 --> 00:26:04.428]  Guaranteed!
[00:26:04.428 --> 00:26:12.291]  Oh my god, of course!
[00:26:12.291 --> 00:26:16.832]  And go, well, should they stop all the cross-species cloning, giving rise to superviruses and bacteria?
[00:26:16.832 --> 00:26:20.713]  If they even knew what cross-species cloning was, they'd go, they're not doing that!
[00:26:20.713 --> 00:26:21.934]  Oh, that's wonderful!
[00:26:21.934 --> 00:26:22.954]  That's very good!
[00:26:24.309 --> 00:26:26.610]  This makes me sick!
[00:26:26.610 --> 00:26:29.710]  Any day now, this stuff could release something that'll kill all of us.
[00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:34.471]  They put the ingredients for mammal pox out from the mouse pox that kills 99.9%.
[00:26:34.471 --> 00:26:39.112]  This is total psychopathic evil.
[00:26:39.112 --> 00:26:41.493]  The thing is, they're running around saying, give up all your rights.
[00:26:41.493 --> 00:26:42.833]  Terrorists are gonna get you.
[00:26:42.833 --> 00:26:45.314]  Oh my God, carbon dioxide's gonna kill us.
[00:26:45.314 --> 00:26:49.315]  And meanwhile, there's incredible real crises all around us.
[00:26:49.315 --> 00:26:50.275]  It's insane!
[00:26:51.991 --> 00:26:52.711]  I gotta settle down.
[00:26:52.711 --> 00:26:55.413]  I got a lot to cover and I haven't done it.
[00:26:55.413 --> 00:27:00.255]  Come up to him and say, have you heard these calls?
[00:27:00.255 --> 00:27:01.896]  In fact, you can even play them like the media does.
[00:27:01.896 --> 00:27:04.537]  Go, have you heard, because they probably think of you as the right-winger.
[00:27:04.537 --> 00:27:08.399]  You've probably criticized the global warming as a fraud, man-made, you know, it's a scam.
[00:27:08.399 --> 00:27:16.823]  So say, have you heard the latest liberal calls, you know, play the left-right paradigm with them, to restrict dihydrogen monoxide?
[00:27:16.823 --> 00:27:19.885]  Well, of course, stupid Bob!
[00:27:19.885 --> 00:27:21.366]  You know how deadly that is?
[00:27:23.476 --> 00:27:28.060]  Dihydrogen monoxide is water.
[00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:30.463]  It's water.
[00:27:30.463 --> 00:27:35.827]  Now, there are three things, well it's really four, but three things on this planet that make life.
[00:27:35.827 --> 00:27:41.393]  Water, carbon dioxide, and oxygen.
[00:27:41.393 --> 00:27:47.078]  Then the heat is added by the sun, and those are your four building blocks.
[00:27:50.629 --> 00:27:55.591]  Now, they're telling you that you are bad because you ex-sale a toxic waste.
[00:27:55.591 --> 00:28:02.374]  They are internationally, this year in January, the UN listed it as a toxic waste.
[00:28:02.374 --> 00:28:04.695]  What you ex-sale is a toxic waste.
[00:28:04.695 --> 00:28:16.259]  The CFR says it's a fraud, but says they're going to use it to quote, make you the enemy.
[00:28:16.259 --> 00:28:17.400]  Richard Inhofe's quote.
[00:28:19.645 --> 00:28:20.866]  Paul's written articles and links to it.
[00:28:20.866 --> 00:28:23.867]  In fact, I'm gonna ask Watson to repost that last article he did on that.
[00:28:23.867 --> 00:28:27.850]  People keep asking me for it, and I don't have it in front of me.
[00:28:27.850 --> 00:28:30.411]  Okay, this is what we're dealing with.
[00:28:30.411 --> 00:28:31.432]  It's a fraud.
[00:28:31.432 --> 00:28:34.974]  Water isn't toxic waste.
[00:28:34.974 --> 00:28:37.736]  Water doesn't hurt you.
[00:28:37.736 --> 00:28:42.939]  Water doesn't need to be taxed and regulated and controlled.
[00:28:42.939 --> 00:28:46.901]  It's not hurting the Earth.
[00:28:46.901 --> 00:28:48.702]  Oxygen is not bad.
[00:28:49.818 --> 00:28:56.004]  Carbon dioxide is... I've had idiots email me and go, people commit suicide with carbon dioxide.
[00:28:56.004 --> 00:29:01.209]  That's carbon monoxide, idiot.
[00:29:01.209 --> 00:29:06.994]  I mean, I really can't deal with another one of you emailing me going, we gotta do something about the carbon.
[00:29:06.994 --> 00:29:09.756]  I like your show, but you just don't understand.
[00:29:09.756 --> 00:29:11.458]  Alex, I bet you're wrong about it.
[00:29:11.458 --> 00:29:12.079]  It's real.
[00:29:12.079 --> 00:29:13.580]  Global warming is real.
[00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:14.481]  You bet it's real.
[00:29:14.481 --> 00:29:15.502]  It's caused by the sun.
[00:29:18.158 --> 00:29:19.419]  I hope it gets a lot warmer.
[00:29:19.419 --> 00:29:22.720]  We don't go into a new ice age.
[00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:34.146]  Humans bloomed in the last 8,000 years because the Hyborian maxim was 10 degrees hotter during what gave us the Bronze Age.
[00:29:34.146 --> 00:29:39.409]  The agrarian society, our ancestors stopped having to be nomads.
[00:29:39.409 --> 00:29:41.830]  You don't know about anthropology.
[00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:42.691]  You're stupid!
[00:29:44.673 --> 00:29:48.596]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:29:48.596 --> 00:29:51.277]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:54.471 --> 00:30:02.474]  World Products now is introducing the new Detoxer Foot and Body Pads that work while you're sleeping to pull heavy metals and toxins from the body.
[00:30:02.474 --> 00:30:10.537]  Our Detoxer Pads release unwanted toxins, relieve stress and pain, and improves the immune system, circulation, and blockages all while you're sleeping.
[00:30:10.537 --> 00:30:14.359]  Very simply, you put one pad on each foot before bedtime and go to sleep.
[00:30:14.359 --> 00:30:17.900]  And when you wake up, the toxins that are drawn out of the body will be in the pads.
[00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:20.121]  You peel them off and throw them away.
[00:30:20.121 --> 00:30:21.022]  It's that simple.
[00:30:21.022 --> 00:30:23.744]  Call 908-691-2608.
[00:30:23.744 --> 00:30:29.348]  We encourage our customers to detox in as many ways as possible to bring the body back to a balance.
[00:30:29.348 --> 00:30:32.470]  The average person is exposed to hundreds of chemicals daily.
[00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:35.332]  This is one of the many powerful ways to detox the body.
[00:30:35.512 --> 00:30:40.376]  We recommend you try our Detoxer Foot Pads and see and feel the difference for yourself.

[00:30:48.783 --> 00:30:49.564]  Call today.
[00:30:49.564 --> 00:30:54.668]  World products now at 1-908-691-2608.
[00:30:54.668 --> 00:30:57.250]  Men, are you urinating more frequently?
[00:30:57.250 --> 00:30:59.472]  Do you wake up to urinate?
[00:30:59.472 --> 00:31:02.214]  Now be honest, is your sex drive what it used to be?
[00:31:03.035 --> 00:31:04.657]  Don't ignore the warning signs.
[00:31:04.657 --> 00:31:07.520]  Prostate problems begin around age 40.
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:11.885]  And by 60, 1 out of every 2 men will have these symptoms.
[00:31:11.885 --> 00:31:14.007]  And they do not go away.
[00:31:14.007 --> 00:31:15.289]  Take Super Beta Prostate.
[00:31:15.289 --> 00:31:19.774]  It has 3,000 times more concentration of the key ingredient in saw palmetto.
[00:31:20.314 --> 00:31:29.161]  It's so powerful, you'd have to take 100 salpal metal capsules in order to get the same health benefits of one super beta prostate.
[00:31:29.161 --> 00:31:33.665]  Try it risk-free for 30 days and give your prostate the nutrition it needs.
[00:31:33.665 --> 00:31:36.267]  For a risk-free trial of beta prostate, dial 1-800-457-9914.
[00:31:36.267 --> 00:31:36.487]  That's 1-800-457-9914.
[00:31:36.487 --> 00:31:37.368]  With super beta prostate,
[00:31:44.133 --> 00:31:47.597]  You get results, or you get your money back.
[00:31:47.597 --> 00:31:47.917]  Dial 1-800-457-9914.
[00:31:47.917 --> 00:31:48.117]  That's 1-800-457-9914.
[00:31:55.171 --> 00:31:56.472]  I'm Dr. Bill Deagle, M.D.
[00:31:56.472 --> 00:31:58.893]  of the Nutrimedical Report here on Genesis.
[00:31:58.893 --> 00:32:01.934]  Allicin, a natural antibiotic from Allomax Nutraceuticals U.S.
[00:32:01.934 --> 00:32:02.674]  is a real thing.
[00:32:02.674 --> 00:32:09.677]  This amazing molecule is a stabilized antimicrobial antipathogenic killer for fresh, never before available garlic.
[00:32:09.677 --> 00:32:15.340]  Allicin molecule is biologically active against all bacterial pathogens, viruses, fungi, parasites, TB,
[00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:20.682]  And it kills flesh-eating bacteria, MRSA, Acinetobacter infections that ravage our everyday health.
[00:32:20.682 --> 00:32:29.525]  Taken daily, it removes these stealth pathogens, clearing our bodies of disease activators that cause chronic health issues and means a much higher level of wellness for you and your family.

[00:32:45.691 --> 00:32:50.733]  That number again, 888-212-8871.
[00:32:50.733 --> 00:32:58.176]  The most powerful natural antimicrobial available.
[00:32:58.176 --> 00:33:01.817]  Let me explain it more simply.
[00:33:01.817 --> 00:33:09.701]  You watch the comedy movie Spaceballs, a takeoff on Star Wars, and they have attacks on air.
[00:33:12.705 --> 00:33:13.286]  It's a joke.
[00:33:13.286 --> 00:33:15.187]  Government's gonna tax the air we breathe.
[00:33:15.187 --> 00:33:20.751]  Well, that's the New York Times headline, but then they went on to say last year that it was a good idea.
[00:33:20.751 --> 00:33:23.734]  It's a tax on air you breathe.
[00:33:23.734 --> 00:33:26.056]  It's taxing the life-giving gas.
[00:33:26.056 --> 00:33:36.224]  In fact, before there was, this is a scientific fact, before there was oxygen in large levels on this planet, there was carbon dioxide.
[00:33:36.224 --> 00:33:39.146]  That's right, the plants were the first creatures on this planet.
[00:33:39.981 --> 00:33:55.294]  And they operated without oxygen, but then they put out oxygen, which then created what we see as our current atmosphere.
[00:33:55.294 --> 00:33:57.656]  Now, they know that you know you breathe oxygen.
[00:33:57.656 --> 00:33:59.558]  It's such a sick joke to them.
[00:33:59.558 --> 00:34:02.661]  So they didn't say we've got greenhouse effect from oxygen.
[00:34:02.661 --> 00:34:04.162]  They said carbon dioxide.
[00:34:04.162 --> 00:34:05.403]  It is such a sick joke.
[00:34:06.676 --> 00:34:12.100]  And they say, oh, we've got to tax any type of meat because of methane destroying the atmosphere.
[00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:13.341]  It's total control.
[00:34:13.341 --> 00:34:17.745]  And they say it in official policy reports, Club of Rome, CFR.
[00:34:17.745 --> 00:34:19.806]  It is stated.
[00:34:19.806 --> 00:34:23.369]  SPP, September 24, 2006.
[00:34:23.369 --> 00:34:26.952]  I mean, we have it all.
[00:34:26.952 --> 00:34:31.035]  We have the IMF World Bank documents where they say they want to bring martial law in.
[00:34:31.035 --> 00:34:32.396]  They want to bankrupt economies.
[00:34:32.396 --> 00:34:34.057]  They want to take everything you've got.
[00:34:34.057 --> 00:34:34.778]  They're predatory.
[00:34:36.542 --> 00:34:44.888]  We have the oil company documents where they bought up 200-plus refineries from 1995 to 2000, closed them to create an artificial bottleneck.
[00:34:44.888 --> 00:34:48.871]  By the way, now that they're about to put Democrats into power, Keith Olbermann's really shown his stripes.
[00:34:48.871 --> 00:34:52.914]  I don't think I have time to play it today, but it's just all disinfo.
[00:34:52.914 --> 00:34:57.877]  But he's playing himself against another disinfo agent, Bush, so that's how the left-right paradigm works.
[00:34:57.877 --> 00:35:00.099]  It makes it look like he's telling the truth.
[00:35:00.099 --> 00:35:04.362]  It's very sophisticated, folks, and if you don't grow up to it and figure out the game,
[00:35:05.310 --> 00:35:06.871]  Doesn't mean you have to believe what I believe.
[00:35:06.871 --> 00:35:09.853]  It means just be aware they're lying to you, they're conning you.
[00:35:09.853 --> 00:35:14.236]  There's some bad stuff afoot.
[00:35:14.236 --> 00:35:18.278]  Something's rotten in the state of Denmark.
[00:35:18.278 --> 00:35:21.080]  So... Let me just get into this.
[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:24.502]  I mean, the problem is... There's just so much.
[00:35:24.502 --> 00:35:25.523]  Here it is.
[00:35:25.523 --> 00:35:27.264]  Times of London.
[00:35:27.264 --> 00:35:31.346]  Today.
[00:35:31.346 --> 00:35:34.088]  Now, this article tells volumes.
[00:35:36.804 --> 00:35:38.485]  Now listen to this.
[00:35:38.485 --> 00:35:52.652]  When you talk about the Rockefellers running things in the U.S., there are all these policy reports and think tanks and Southern Poverty Law Center saying it's imaginary, they don't own anything, they're just a poor family.
[00:35:52.652 --> 00:35:57.555]  They had tens of billions in assets a hundred years ago plus, okay?
[00:35:57.555 --> 00:36:01.397]  That was back when a billion was a billion.
[00:36:01.397 --> 00:36:05.159]  And a Ford and a Chevy still lasted ten years like they should.
[00:36:09.315 --> 00:36:12.056]  Rockefeller's urge action on climate change.
[00:36:12.056 --> 00:36:14.077]  Now, what does action mean?
[00:36:14.077 --> 00:36:19.919]  It means home inspectors, regulations, taxing on everything, total control of your life, one-child policies.
[00:36:19.919 --> 00:36:25.581]  Now being proposed, as we told you they would.
[00:36:25.581 --> 00:36:30.922]  Rockefeller's urge action on climate change.
[00:36:30.922 --> 00:36:35.244]  One of America's most powerful families will call tomorrow for a sweeping shake-up
[00:36:36.155 --> 00:36:39.176]  At the top of Exxon Mobil, the world's largest oil company.
[00:36:39.176 --> 00:36:42.157]  By the way, they own the majority of the other oil companies.
[00:36:42.157 --> 00:36:45.558]  They engineered the quote, trust-busting.
[00:36:45.558 --> 00:36:48.279]  They knew everybody was mad at them about their tax-free foundations.
[00:36:48.279 --> 00:36:49.880]  They don't pay taxes, by the way.
[00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:52.541]  No, they pay zero tax.
[00:36:52.541 --> 00:37:04.925]  And so they staged the 1906 Sherman Antitrust Act, just like it's now come out that the Federal Reserve and the private banks paid newspapers to write editorials against the bankers
[00:37:06.599 --> 00:37:13.604]  And had the bankers come out and say, we're against the Federal Reserve Act to fool the public.
[00:37:13.604 --> 00:37:14.745]  See how they operate?
[00:37:14.745 --> 00:37:17.567]  Very slick.
[00:37:17.567 --> 00:37:19.268]  Oh, please don't throw me in the briar patch.
[00:37:19.268 --> 00:37:26.994]  You don't know the story of, uh... Was it Briar Rabbit?
[00:37:26.994 --> 00:37:28.775]  What's his name?
[00:37:28.775 --> 00:37:30.476]  Where he wants to be thrown in the briar patch.
[00:37:30.476 --> 00:37:31.197]  You know, the, uh...
[00:37:32.085 --> 00:37:36.406]  Farmer catches him and he says, please don't throw me in the briar patch.
[00:37:36.406 --> 00:37:37.166]  Oh, I'm so scared.
[00:37:37.166 --> 00:37:39.847]  Just kill me, eat me, boil me, stew me.
[00:37:39.847 --> 00:37:41.988]  Just don't throw me in the briar patch, please.
[00:37:41.988 --> 00:37:42.768]  Oh, please.
[00:37:42.768 --> 00:37:47.229]  Oh, yeah, I'm gonna throw you in the briar patch.
[00:37:47.229 --> 00:37:50.310]  Oh, please don't make all my billions tax-free.
[00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:53.530]  Oh, please don't give me unlimited secrecy and power.
[00:37:53.530 --> 00:37:54.511]  Oh, please.
[00:37:54.511 --> 00:37:55.151]  Oh, God.
[00:37:55.151 --> 00:37:55.611]  Not that.
[00:37:57.105 --> 00:38:00.248]  Please don't let me be above any type of congressional investigation.
[00:38:00.248 --> 00:38:01.710]  Please don't give me unlimited power.
[00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:03.171]  Please.
[00:38:03.171 --> 00:38:04.172]  Please, not that.
[00:38:04.172 --> 00:38:05.954]  Nothing but that.
[00:38:05.954 --> 00:38:07.816]  Just save me from the carbon dioxide.
[00:38:07.816 --> 00:38:08.577]  It'll kill me.
[00:38:10.370 --> 00:38:14.732]  Rockefeller's urge action on climate change.
[00:38:14.732 --> 00:38:16.413]  One of America's most powerful families.
[00:38:16.413 --> 00:38:18.454]  This is written like, oh, they're so good.
[00:38:18.454 --> 00:38:20.655]  Oh, they're going against their own interests.
[00:38:20.655 --> 00:38:22.717]  They're so sweet.
[00:38:22.717 --> 00:38:24.337]  Oh, they're so sweet.
[00:38:24.337 --> 00:38:29.200]  They literally funded the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute and created Adolf Adolf Hitler.
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:31.521]  Oh, they're so liberal and good.
[00:38:31.521 --> 00:38:38.625]  One of America's most powerful families will call tomorrow for a sweeping shakeup at the top of Exxon Mobil, the world's largest oil company.
[00:38:39.574 --> 00:38:58.369]  A group of descendants of John D. Rockefeller, who founded Exxon's predecessor, Standard Oil, in 1870, will begin a campaign to split the role of chief executive and chairman of the board at the oil and gas group, a role held by Rex Tillerson.
[00:38:58.369 --> 00:39:01.372]  That evil Rex Tillerson, oh my goodness.
[00:39:03.129 --> 00:39:06.091]  They play class envy and say he makes 20 million a year.
[00:39:06.091 --> 00:39:09.394]  Folks, that's like pennies in Rockefeller's pocket.
[00:39:09.394 --> 00:39:13.337]  Rockefeller owns the majority stock in the Federal Reserve with the Queen of England.
[00:39:13.337 --> 00:39:15.378]  He issues the money.
[00:39:15.378 --> 00:39:20.662]  He's worth thousands of trillions in leveraged assets.
[00:39:20.662 --> 00:39:21.703]  Okay.
[00:39:21.703 --> 00:39:24.445]  Oh, but they play, oh, Rex Tillerson.
[00:39:24.445 --> 00:39:26.166]  Oh, he's the bad one.
[00:39:26.166 --> 00:39:29.048]  David Rockefeller's fighting with him.
[00:39:29.048 --> 00:39:30.109]  Oh, my gosh.
[00:39:31.198 --> 00:39:33.100]  Oh, twenty million!
[00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:37.583]  Oh my gosh, it's so much!
[00:39:37.583 --> 00:39:54.515]  A group of descendants of John D. Rockefeller, who founded Exxon's predecessor, Standard Oil, in 1870, will begin a campaign to split the role of chief executive and chairman of the board of the oil and gas group, a role held by Rex Tillerson.
[00:39:54.515 --> 00:40:00.079]  Last night, the family group issued a statement saying that the company's leadership was failing to address the future
[00:40:01.275 --> 00:40:05.696]  of the energy and related industry hurdles.
[00:40:05.696 --> 00:40:17.278]  It said the representatives would make the announcement in New York to explain that the majority of the family is now so concerned about the direction of Exxon Mobil Corporation that it is urging a major change.
[00:40:17.278 --> 00:40:27.280]  Exxon, which earned $40 million last year when Mr. Tillerson was paid $21.7 million, was the slowest of the big
[00:40:29.191 --> 00:40:32.173]  Of the big oil majors to acknowledge climate change.
[00:40:32.173 --> 00:40:38.397]  The family is calling for an independent chairman and a bigger leadership role for the directors.
[00:40:38.397 --> 00:40:39.658]  That's doublespeak.
[00:40:39.658 --> 00:40:42.721]  Rex Tillerson is an independent chairman.
[00:40:42.721 --> 00:40:49.446]  The campaign comes as big oil companies face mounting pressure to deal with public concern over global warming.
[00:40:49.446 --> 00:40:52.228]  See, the oil cartel itself is raping everybody.
[00:40:52.228 --> 00:40:52.848]  OPEC.
[00:40:52.848 --> 00:40:55.190]  The oil companies are just the delivery mechanism.
[00:40:55.996 --> 00:41:01.638]  They are engaged in, of course, tons of fraud and criminality as well, but it's small in comparison.
[00:41:01.638 --> 00:41:05.179]  And what you think of as the oil companies is the delivery mechanism, as I said.
[00:41:05.179 --> 00:41:10.001]  And so they're going to parlay all your anger at high gas prices into those dirty rich Tillerson!
[00:41:10.001 --> 00:41:12.422]  He won't give us a global carbon tax!
[00:41:12.422 --> 00:41:13.242]  Dirty!
[00:41:13.242 --> 00:41:15.963]  Don't you want more taxes on your oil?
[00:41:15.963 --> 00:41:16.864]  Then get him!
[00:41:16.864 --> 00:41:18.584]  Look, he's rich!
[00:41:18.584 --> 00:41:21.065]  Rich!
[00:41:21.065 --> 00:41:22.426]  21 million dollars!
[00:41:22.426 --> 00:41:23.406]  Just incredible!
[00:41:26.821 --> 00:41:37.744]  More than a hundred Rockefeller descendants hold a significant stake in Exxon, though through a variety of trust, but the exact percentage is unknown.
[00:41:37.744 --> 00:41:41.385]  Because under their Sherman Antitrust Act, oh, that defeated them.
[00:41:41.385 --> 00:41:42.825]  Oh, they hated it.
[00:41:42.825 --> 00:41:45.986]  They hate the Briar Patch.
[00:41:45.986 --> 00:41:50.227]  Please don't throw me where I live and where I breathe and where I want to rule.
[00:41:50.227 --> 00:41:54.988]  So you're not allowed to know, but we do know the details of it.
[00:41:55.606 --> 00:42:00.690]  They broke their total monopoly of oil distribution and refining.
[00:42:00.690 --> 00:42:03.011]  Total monopoly!
[00:42:03.011 --> 00:42:11.818]  In 1906, because of incredible price gouging, and people weren't as stupid back then, they could still read and knew that the Rockefellers were dirty trash.
[00:42:11.818 --> 00:42:22.966]  And so they said, so they staged a shill and operation, and they went underground and broke it into 12 parts and, just unbelievable, just like the Bells, they broke into pieces, now re-merged.
[00:42:24.864 --> 00:42:30.986]  More than a hundred Rockefeller descendants hold a significant stake in Exxon through a variety of trust, but the exact percentage is unknown.
[00:42:30.986 --> 00:42:47.753]  The campaign is being spearheaded by Nevada Rockefeller Goodwin, Neva Rockefeller Goodwin, an economist and great-granddaughter of John D. Rockefeller, the global patron of eugenics, I would add, as well as Peter O'Neill, head of the Rockefeller Family Committee, dealing with Exxon Mobil's one small holding.
[00:42:47.753 --> 00:42:49.614]  He is the great-grandson of John D. Rockefeller.
[00:42:49.614 --> 00:42:54.396]  Now remember, this is only a small piece of the Rockefeller assets.
[00:42:56.127 --> 00:43:05.702]  And, but, you bet the chairman of the individual oil companies, they're all global, New World Order, but they're like, look, you want to start taking our profits and taxing it, and taxing the people?
[00:43:05.702 --> 00:43:11.250]  See, they're creating artificial scarcity, like De Beers and Oppenheimer has over the diamonds.
[00:43:11.250 --> 00:43:11.630]  And so...
[00:43:14.068 --> 00:43:14.828]  It's just amazing.
[00:43:14.828 --> 00:43:18.690]  And they say, we don't want Exxon involved in funding research into global warming.
[00:43:18.690 --> 00:43:21.632]  You know, we don't want them putting out propaganda for their side.
[00:43:21.632 --> 00:43:29.316]  Exxon produces nearly 4.2 million barrels a day and has revenues of $404.5 billion.
[00:43:29.316 --> 00:43:30.416]  But see, that's nothing.
[00:43:30.416 --> 00:43:32.017]  What's $404.5 billion?
[00:43:32.017 --> 00:43:38.741]  If you have global government in control of a global central bank and you just can issue all the currency and credit, who cares about oil?
[00:43:38.741 --> 00:43:43.503]  That's why the Rockefeller family is having to run out Rex Tillerson.
[00:43:45.868 --> 00:43:47.729]  Rexy.
[00:43:47.729 --> 00:43:49.870]  Who looks like Jabba the Hutt, I would add.
[00:43:49.870 --> 00:44:00.234]  In 2006, Senator Jay Rockefeller wrote to Mr. Tillerson, urging the company to stop funding groups that deny the existence of climate change.
[00:44:00.234 --> 00:44:01.115]  Oh, man.
[00:44:01.115 --> 00:44:09.038]  As if Dutch Royal Shell and BP don't fund the fake peak oil scam crowd.
[00:44:09.038 --> 00:44:10.719]  So there you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:44:11.795 --> 00:44:14.297]  They've got their little nothing Tony Rex Tillerson.
[00:44:14.297 --> 00:44:17.779]  They'll, well, trot him out.
[00:44:17.779 --> 00:44:20.261]  He'll be the big bad man.
[00:44:20.261 --> 00:44:23.042]  He's the kingpin.
[00:44:23.042 --> 00:44:25.244]  21 million dollars!
[00:44:25.244 --> 00:44:29.106]  Oh my goody gumdrops!
[00:44:29.106 --> 00:44:30.747]  That is nothing.
[00:44:30.747 --> 00:44:33.289]  See, they always focus you in on CEO's compensation.
[00:44:33.289 --> 00:44:36.871]  They're little pimps.
[00:44:36.871 --> 00:44:37.752]  Compared to the
[00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:47.457]  Trillions a year the Rockefellers make off just off their oil company holdings, and then of course they have a deal with Anglo-American Oil.
[00:44:47.457 --> 00:44:52.941]  The British Royal Family gets 80% of the Saudi money.
[00:44:52.941 --> 00:44:55.283]  See, the Saudis are just dumb.
[00:44:55.283 --> 00:44:57.765]  The 40,000 princes or whatever it is.
[00:44:57.765 --> 00:45:08.073]  They like to run around in white jet jumbo jets and have 200, you know, hot blonde supermodels' wives shipped in from the U.S.
[00:45:10.097 --> 00:45:13.140]  From the Midwest.
[00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:17.523]  They don't like them, they just kill them when they're so dumb they still go over there.
[00:45:17.523 --> 00:45:23.829]  They run around in gold-plated Rolls Royces and Bentleys.
[00:45:23.829 --> 00:45:26.611]  They have conspicuous consumption.
[00:45:26.611 --> 00:45:29.293]  The Rockefellers, by 1900, they criticized J.P.
[00:45:29.293 --> 00:45:31.355]  Morgan publicly and said, stop it.
[00:45:31.355 --> 00:45:31.635]  J.P.
[00:45:31.635 --> 00:45:36.720]  Morgan would ride down people with six white stallions pulling his carriage.
[00:45:37.887 --> 00:45:40.988]  He would beat people to death with a cane if they looked at him wrong.
[00:45:40.988 --> 00:45:47.772]  And the police did nothing and just cowered from the huge, pot-bellied, six-foot-five giants just stomping around.
[00:45:47.772 --> 00:45:51.533]  And when he died, it turned out he had less than one million.
[00:45:51.533 --> 00:45:58.077]  He was worth hundreds of billions when he died, and it turned out he was a Rothschild agent.
[00:45:58.077 --> 00:45:59.797]  Completely owned by the Bank of England.
[00:45:59.797 --> 00:46:01.638]  Mainstream history.
[00:46:01.638 --> 00:46:05.380]  Just a big bully who had turned out just like Rex Tillerson.
[00:46:07.014 --> 00:46:08.755]  But we all know about J.P.
[00:46:08.755 --> 00:46:10.216]  Morgan!
[00:46:10.216 --> 00:46:13.658]  And we know about Rex Tillerson!
[00:46:13.658 --> 00:46:16.220]  They're nothing!
[00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:22.464]  His nine hundred and something grand he had when he died is the equivalent of Rex Tillerson's hundreds of millions.
[00:46:22.464 --> 00:46:29.028]  It's nothing.
[00:46:29.028 --> 00:46:31.410]  So we've got that news for you.
[00:46:38.396 --> 00:46:40.298]  So that's the type of issue we're dealing with there.
[00:46:40.298 --> 00:46:42.279]  Let me just run through some of this other news.
[00:46:42.279 --> 00:46:46.683]  I'll never get to it all.
[00:46:46.683 --> 00:46:55.691]  Let me now cover a few big developments that have taken place.
[00:46:55.691 --> 00:47:00.855]  Two issues, and Jason Bermas is down here with us for the next month and a half or so, working on a new film with us.
[00:47:03.596 --> 00:47:17.787]  But I've got him in here on two issues, because I don't think I'm even going to have time to play this today, because I've got Len Horowitz coming up in 15 minutes, then I've got an economist on for two hours, former government analyst, really very intelligent, informed on what's happening with the economy.
[00:47:17.787 --> 00:47:30.056]  Piercing understanding, Richard C. Cook, but this is so amazing, I might air some of this with Horowitz and get his take on it, I don't know, I may actually do that.
[00:47:30.788 --> 00:47:38.534]  But, uh, up on PrisonPlanet.com, up on InfoWars.com, headline, Why is Gary Hart so fearful of discussing his new world order?
[00:47:38.534 --> 00:47:42.737]  CFR member contradictory, deceitful about context of term.
[00:47:42.737 --> 00:47:47.580]  Ex-Senator repeats warning that Neocon's looking to stage terror attack as pretext to attack Iran.
[00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:49.702]  He admits it on video, in clear audio.
[00:47:49.702 --> 00:47:52.243]  It's up on the websites right now.
[00:47:52.243 --> 00:47:52.784]  We are changing.
[00:47:52.784 --> 00:47:55.646]  Again, Luke Rudowsky and Tom Fote doing a fabulous job.
[00:47:55.646 --> 00:47:57.727]  In fact, I'm stopping the presses on the film.
[00:47:57.727 --> 00:47:59.809]  I basically finished just to add this.
[00:48:00.365 --> 00:48:01.545]  So amazing.
[00:48:01.545 --> 00:48:04.126]  And the Lynne Cheney confrontation.
[00:48:04.126 --> 00:48:09.308]  But he just says, we need to get rid of sovereignty.
[00:48:09.308 --> 00:48:10.728]  And then they said, well, you called for a new world order.
[00:48:10.728 --> 00:48:11.448]  And he said, I never did.
[00:48:11.448 --> 00:48:13.789]  And then they play the clip.
[00:48:13.789 --> 00:48:15.429]  And they show other confrontations where he denies it.
[00:48:15.429 --> 00:48:20.951]  Then they say, well, in this letter to Iran, published in the Huffington Post, you said that the U.S.
[00:48:20.951 --> 00:48:21.651]  may stage attacks.
[00:48:21.651 --> 00:48:23.091]  And he said, no, I didn't say that.
[00:48:23.091 --> 00:48:24.692]  I said they may stage an attack for war.
[00:48:25.808 --> 00:48:27.529]  First he says, I never said that, you're a liar.
[00:48:27.529 --> 00:48:30.392]  Then they give him his letter and he says, okay, it's a mock letter.
[00:48:30.392 --> 00:48:35.916]  I did, I mean, folks, they treat, do you like being treated like this?
[00:48:35.916 --> 00:48:39.019]  I'm not smart, folks!
[00:48:39.019 --> 00:48:41.541]  I'm just somebody who isn't gonna be conned.
[00:48:41.541 --> 00:48:47.786]  I mean, I've had friends who quote, you know, screw me a couple times and I quit being their friend.
[00:48:47.786 --> 00:48:52.810]  And, you know, if a neighbor does something to me a couple times, I don't just talk to him anymore.
[00:48:54.242 --> 00:48:56.864]  I mean, I don't understand this.
[00:48:56.864 --> 00:48:59.467]  Jason Bernis, you've seen this video.
[00:48:59.467 --> 00:49:00.507]  Give us your take on it.
[00:49:00.507 --> 00:49:06.432]  All right, well, first of all, he starts out talking about eroding national sovereignty and globalization, which we know is his plan.
[00:49:06.432 --> 00:49:11.597]  I mean, he's openly talked about this dozens of times on television, toured the country with it.
[00:49:11.597 --> 00:49:12.277]  He's got a new book.
[00:49:12.277 --> 00:49:13.538]  He's touring with it now.
[00:49:13.538 --> 00:49:19.683]  So then he starts getting, you know, confronted about these views, basically, that they're not the best views ever.
[00:49:19.683 --> 00:49:22.826]  And first of all, he says, well, that New World Order term,
[00:49:23.582 --> 00:49:28.888]  He denies using it, and he's like, well, I did use it, but I was commenting on George Bush, who only said it once.
[00:49:28.888 --> 00:49:30.830]  Now, he said it dozens of times.
[00:49:30.830 --> 00:49:33.833]  He said it more than 200 times.
[00:49:33.833 --> 00:49:37.697]  All over the place, you know, from the State of the Union address to the news.
[00:49:37.697 --> 00:49:38.338]  He's not the only one.
[00:49:38.338 --> 00:49:40.100]  We got Dick Cheney talking about it.
[00:49:40.100 --> 00:49:42.122]  He did White House Oval Office addresses.
[00:49:42.222 --> 00:49:43.823]  Oh yeah, I mean, that's the thing.
[00:49:43.823 --> 00:49:46.025]  This isn't just a one-time term.
[00:49:46.025 --> 00:49:53.990]  And then he gets called out on the fact that days after 9-11, I believe it was either the 13th or 14th, he said we could use 9-11 to create this new world order.
[00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:57.852]  Use this disaster as a pretext to, uh... Create a new world order.
[00:49:57.852 --> 00:49:58.433]  Set a new world order.
[00:49:58.433 --> 00:49:59.534]  Make, make, make.
[00:49:59.534 --> 00:50:00.955]  Use these lemons to make lemonade.
[00:50:00.955 --> 00:50:02.015]  Absolutely.
[00:50:02.015 --> 00:50:11.361]  So then, what I find the sickest is when he tries to say... First, he tries to really deny knowledge of this letter to Iran, like he's written so many open letters to Ahmadinejad.
[00:50:11.361 --> 00:50:11.982]  He's written one.
[00:50:12.542 --> 00:50:14.683]  Okay, then he says, well, it's a mock letter.
[00:50:14.683 --> 00:50:21.685]  But it's very apparent that these people know... And then later he says, no, I wrote it to the Iranian government saying that I hope they know we'll stage events.
[00:50:21.685 --> 00:50:23.065]  Yeah, and that's the same thing.
[00:50:23.065 --> 00:50:23.765]  Here's the deal, folks.
[00:50:23.765 --> 00:50:31.147]  They have had a dumbed-down public that has been totally asleep at the wheel for so long that they're just accustomed.
[00:50:31.147 --> 00:50:34.848]  Now people are kind of got one eye open going, oh, what, was he lying to me?
[00:50:34.848 --> 00:50:37.189]  And so now the jig's up.
[00:50:37.975 --> 00:50:38.715]  But they're in place.
[00:50:38.715 --> 00:50:39.916]  They've got camps in place.
[00:50:39.916 --> 00:50:41.877]  They've brainwashed the cops.
[00:50:41.877 --> 00:50:43.537]  Please, police, don't go along with this.
[00:50:43.537 --> 00:50:45.818]  Jason, you heard some of my BBC debate.
[00:50:45.818 --> 00:50:47.599]  I want to come back, spend five minutes on that.
[00:50:47.599 --> 00:50:49.139]  Then we're going to go to Dr. Lynn Horowitz.
[00:50:49.139 --> 00:50:52.081]  This is the GCN Radio Network, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:50:54.784 --> 00:51:07.938]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[00:51:07.938 --> 00:51:11.762]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.
[00:51:12.102 --> 00:51:18.987]  In which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[00:51:18.987 --> 00:51:22.410]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[00:51:22.410 --> 00:51:30.295]  From hijackers being trained at US military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.
[00:51:30.295 --> 00:51:35.719]  Secure your copy of Loose Change Final Cut today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.

[00:51:48.574 --> 00:51:53.881]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[00:51:54.807 --> 00:51:58.588]  Hi, this is Alex Jones, and I want to talk to you about the high price of gasoline.
[00:51:58.588 --> 00:52:03.309]  It's no secret that gasoline quality is poor, even though we're paying record prices at the pump.
[00:52:03.309 --> 00:52:08.590]  I have run across a company called SFR, who has developed two products that improve gas mileage.
[00:52:08.590 --> 00:52:19.833]  Instead of paying a mechanic as much as $300 to clean your injection system, Protecta Complete Fuel System Treatment cleans to 95% of new engine condition, improving mileage in only one tank full.
[00:52:19.833 --> 00:52:22.174]  Protecta Engine Treatment not only reduces friction,
[00:52:22.594 --> 00:52:24.636]  But it extends the life of your engine.
[00:52:24.636 --> 00:52:25.536]  Let's face it.
[00:52:25.536 --> 00:52:28.379]  With the high price of gasoline, it's time to take action.
[00:52:28.379 --> 00:52:36.405]  Purchase a protective fuel system treatment for only $9.95 and receive a free engine treatment which is a $12.95 value free.
[00:52:36.405 --> 00:52:38.707]  Call 888-USE-SFR1.
[00:52:38.707 --> 00:52:41.829]  That number again is 888-USE-SFR1.
[00:52:41.829 --> 00:52:45.892]  Or check them out online at oilcompanysecret.com.

[00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:52.842]  Act now.
[00:52:54.676 --> 00:52:59.199]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[00:52:59.199 --> 00:53:04.302]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:53:04.302 --> 00:53:05.802]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:53:05.802 --> 00:53:09.424]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[00:53:29.597 --> 00:53:30.798]  No animal testing.

[00:53:32.119 --> 00:53:34.020]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.
[00:53:34.020 --> 00:53:35.421]  And I say big time.

[00:53:55.675 --> 00:54:01.478]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:01.478 --> 00:54:04.280]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:10.423]  Burma's finisher key point about this is Gary Hart admitting that yes, we staged terror attacks.
[00:54:10.423 --> 00:54:11.364]  He says it on video.
[00:54:12.739 --> 00:54:22.404]  Well, the interesting thing again, Alex, is that he brings up the Maine and Havana Harbor, and he brings up the Gulf of Tonkin incident, which are now, it's now declassified.
[00:54:22.404 --> 00:54:27.886]  They're false flag events to mobilize us into war, really a police state at home, you get to clutch down on the people.
[00:54:27.886 --> 00:54:33.589]  And he knows this is their tool to progress into the next level of, you know, globalization.
[00:54:34.361 --> 00:54:36.162]  They did 9-11, folks.
[00:54:36.162 --> 00:54:37.363]  I mean, they killed us.
[00:54:37.363 --> 00:54:37.844]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:54:37.844 --> 00:54:43.268]  And the next generations of Gary Hart, you know, the next politicians coming up will say that in 20 to 30 years.
[00:54:43.268 --> 00:54:46.870]  They'll write letters to the new boogeyman saying that same exact thing.
[00:54:46.870 --> 00:54:48.091]  Hey, we staged 9-11.
[00:54:48.091 --> 00:54:48.812]  Better watch it.
[00:54:48.812 --> 00:54:49.632]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:54:49.632 --> 00:54:51.153]  And then they'll say, oh, it was a mock letter.
[00:54:51.153 --> 00:54:54.636]  You know, when the population starts to wake up and go, did he really say that?
[00:54:54.636 --> 00:54:57.198]  But then at the end he says, no, I did write it to their government to warn them.
[00:54:57.418 --> 00:54:57.898]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:54:57.898 --> 00:55:01.980]  I mean, he, like, it's your biggest liar, and he starts sweating, he looks crazy, and that's the deal.
[00:55:01.980 --> 00:55:03.340]  These guys all think they're real smart.
[00:55:03.340 --> 00:55:09.143]  No, we were gullible, we'd been a free nation, we thought everything was okay, and we got taken to the cleaners.
[00:55:09.143 --> 00:55:10.683]  Now, I want to shift gears.
[00:55:10.683 --> 00:55:16.806]  Last night, I go on national, international, you know, main BBC, the main channel.
[00:55:16.806 --> 00:55:19.587]  I mean, I call Paul Watson, he goes, oh yeah, everybody listens to that.
[00:55:19.587 --> 00:55:22.028]  And this goes out, international, national.
[00:55:22.028 --> 00:55:25.569]  Biggest thing over there, radio-wise, this is huge, millions of listeners.
[00:55:26.525 --> 00:55:29.068]  And they had five people against me.
[00:55:29.068 --> 00:55:32.191]  Five people against me.
[00:55:32.191 --> 00:55:36.755]  Now, you were busy working on the film last night when I was on there at like six o'clock from my house, so you only heard the end of it.
[00:55:36.755 --> 00:55:37.816]  I was there.
[00:55:37.816 --> 00:55:40.679]  But I come on the air and I say, okay, you said it was a conspiracy.
[00:55:40.679 --> 00:55:42.421]  The Gulf of Tonkin stage now declassified.
[00:55:42.421 --> 00:55:44.763]  USS Liberty stage now declassified.
[00:55:44.763 --> 00:55:47.106]  Which, by the way, if you didn't know, folks, it's now been admitted.
[00:55:47.106 --> 00:55:48.107]  And we were all right.
[00:55:48.107 --> 00:55:50.349]  The films, the shows, trying to debunk us, admitted.
[00:55:51.153 --> 00:55:59.343]  And the hosts were like, that's not true, and then the BBC guy had to go, well, actually it's true, but we didn't kill too many people with the liberty and stuff.
[00:55:59.343 --> 00:56:05.951]  And then it goes on from there, and yeah, Northwoods is real, but the government did plan to stage 9-11 style attacks, but they didn't do it that time.
[00:56:07.275 --> 00:56:08.536]  And then they would just fade me down.
[00:56:08.536 --> 00:56:10.558]  So I got about 10 minutes and an hour.
[00:56:10.558 --> 00:56:12.419]  And so, it was 5 to 1.
[00:56:12.419 --> 00:56:19.124]  And they gave themselves, and then they kept saying, well, we know you believe in no men on the moon, you believe Joan of Arc, you know, didn't really die.
[00:56:19.124 --> 00:56:22.406]  And they would mix it in, and they would go, everybody knows this is crazy.
[00:56:22.406 --> 00:56:24.228]  Well, no, the majority believe it's an inside job.
[00:56:24.228 --> 00:56:27.590]  So they used all this groupthink, but I still completely kicked their butt.
[00:56:27.590 --> 00:56:28.931]  Then at the end, they bring a U.S.
[00:56:28.931 --> 00:56:31.313]  debunker on, this shniveler from New York.
[00:56:31.903 --> 00:56:34.784]  I don't even want to give the guy attention, but it's the guy you guys debated.
[00:56:34.784 --> 00:56:39.045]  And he just starts, and I start going, well, building assembly, firefighters, police saying they were told get back there and blow it up.
[00:56:39.045 --> 00:56:41.326]  And he goes, oh, you're saying they blew it up?
[00:56:41.326 --> 00:56:43.206]  And I said, and they faded me down.
[00:56:43.206 --> 00:56:45.047]  No, we're saying they were told to get back.
[00:56:45.047 --> 00:56:47.608]  See, it's a shake and bake.
[00:56:47.608 --> 00:56:48.928]  We know what they're going to say.
[00:56:48.928 --> 00:56:54.390]  Then they go, oh, if there was molten steel, how did demolition explosives make that?
[00:56:54.390 --> 00:56:55.190]  They don't cause heat.
[00:56:55.948 --> 00:57:03.350]  It's not for us to explain how 1,800-degree jet fuel makes 3,000-degree molten slag and 2,600-degree a month later.
[00:57:03.350 --> 00:57:04.371]  That's the photos.
[00:57:04.371 --> 00:57:06.331]  That's the FBI planes.
[00:57:06.331 --> 00:57:10.513]  We now know it was Thermate that did it, which is explosive and causes the heat.
[00:57:10.513 --> 00:57:12.933]  And we went and tested it, and that was the case.
[00:57:12.933 --> 00:57:14.474]  But they would never let me answer.
[00:57:14.474 --> 00:57:20.356]  It was totally rigged, but I still completely kicked their butt and dominated them because I would just... Well, I mean, you heard it.
[00:57:20.356 --> 00:57:20.756]  What'd you think?
[00:57:20.876 --> 00:57:21.677]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:57:21.677 --> 00:57:31.904]  And the crazy thing was that the guy who worked for the BBC that's going to put out that disinfo piece on World Trade Center 7 was trying to keep it open-ended, like there were these unanswered questions, Alex.
[00:57:31.904 --> 00:57:36.208]  So people will watch the show and he's going to answer the questions for the public, and we're going to find out.
[00:57:36.208 --> 00:57:38.109]  But then he had to say, oh, we did report it.
[00:57:38.109 --> 00:57:41.091]  Building 7 fell before it fell.
[00:57:41.091 --> 00:57:42.653]  And I said, yeah, and then you lost the tapes.
[00:57:42.653 --> 00:57:44.034]  He goes, oh, we found them again.
[00:57:44.554 --> 00:57:54.839]  And then he goes on, they're having the counters for the whole TV show, and he said, well, they all knew that that building was going to fall, that's why they said, get back, and he goes, it's the first in history, and I go, no, it was three that day.
[00:57:54.839 --> 00:57:59.781]  Yeah, absolutely, and if you look at building six, I mean, literally, that's where a quarter of the building is scooped out.
[00:57:59.781 --> 00:58:03.363]  You know, we've had popular mechanics and... Yeah, it's admitted, that's a fake photo!
[00:58:03.363 --> 00:58:06.725]  Yeah, because we have the video from two different cameras, where there's not scooped out.
[00:58:06.725 --> 00:58:07.585]  Yeah, that's absolutely right.
[00:58:07.585 --> 00:58:10.166]  World Trade Center 7 did not have 25% scooped out.
[00:58:10.166 --> 00:58:11.567]  We have video inside the building.
[00:58:11.727 --> 00:58:14.708]  Well, by the way, the Poplar Mechanics, it is a gray-faced building.
[00:58:14.708 --> 00:58:15.889]  And we've now zoomed back.
[00:58:15.889 --> 00:58:17.830]  We found the crop photo they did.
[00:58:17.830 --> 00:58:18.670]  It's a crop photo.
[00:58:18.670 --> 00:58:23.112]  These are the folks that brought you the Remington paintings for the main.
[00:58:23.112 --> 00:58:24.853]  It's the same people!
[00:58:24.853 --> 00:58:26.313]  It never ends!
[00:58:26.313 --> 00:58:29.154]  And so they show you a gray building.
[00:58:29.154 --> 00:58:29.815]  Ha ha ha!
[00:58:29.815 --> 00:58:31.075]  Just idiot!
[00:58:31.075 --> 00:58:35.957]  WTC 7 was red, folks.
[00:58:35.957 --> 00:58:37.698]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:39.468 --> 00:58:44.874]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:44.874 --> 00:58:46.276]  It is a big idea.
[00:58:46.276 --> 00:58:49.119]  A new world order.
[00:58:49.119 --> 00:58:54.025]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:58:54.025 --> 00:58:56.848]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:58:56.848 --> 00:58:59.010]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:58:59.619 --> 00:59:02.801]  For thousands of years, their Dark Order grew.
[00:59:02.801 --> 00:59:10.105]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:59:13.148 --> 00:59:18.593]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:59:18.593 --> 00:59:22.476]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:59:22.476 --> 00:59:25.038]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:59:25.038 --> 00:59:26.199]  Most people have no idea.
[00:59:26.199 --> 00:59:26.979]  They're not after money.
[00:59:26.979 --> 00:59:28.240]  They have all the money they need.
[00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:29.261]  They're after power.
[00:59:29.261 --> 00:59:30.402]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[00:59:39.112 --> 00:59:39.873]  Endgame.
[00:59:39.873 --> 00:59:41.895]  Blueprint for global enslaving.
[00:59:41.895 --> 00:59:47.142]  You have been warned.
[00:59:47.142 --> 00:59:49.546]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:49.546 --> 00:59:52.289]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:57.984 --> 00:59:59.745]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:59.745 --> 01:00:01.325]  You want answers?
[01:00:01.325 --> 01:00:02.866]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:02.866 --> 01:00:07.067]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:07.067 --> 01:00:14.589]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:14.589 --> 01:00:22.552]  Dr. Lynn Horowitz coming up to talk about how AIDS and many other bio-weapons, HIV, have been engineered.
[01:00:22.552 --> 01:00:25.053]  Jeremiah Wright brought up his best-selling book,
[01:00:27.412 --> 01:00:31.215]  The Press Club a few days ago, and the media is acting like it's a wild-eyed conspiracy theory.
[01:00:31.215 --> 01:00:35.679]  So we thought we'd do an hour on how they're hitting you with bio-weapons.
[01:00:35.679 --> 01:00:38.181]  Because the government loves you, they're your good friend.
[01:00:38.181 --> 01:00:40.623]  But Jason Burmish, I heard part of the BBC debate.
[01:00:40.623 --> 01:00:43.545]  I want Watson, who recorded it, to do an analysis of it.
[01:00:43.545 --> 01:00:45.226]  I mean, what were other points from what you heard?
[01:00:45.226 --> 01:00:52.012]  I mean, I was there, and just the five-to-one thing, and how they would make a statement and then fade me down, so I couldn't counter.
[01:00:52.794 --> 01:00:53.435]  But it didn't matter.
[01:00:53.435 --> 01:00:55.797]  The calls they took, people were calling and agreeing with me.
[01:00:55.797 --> 01:01:07.767]  In fact, I hadn't gotten to Building 7 yet, how BBC reported that it had fallen exactly as it fell 25 minutes before, and how their own presenter believes that it may be a conspiracy.
[01:01:07.767 --> 01:01:12.151]  And it's the same thing, like, before Lee Harvey Oswald had been arrested, before his name had been released,
[01:01:12.751 --> 01:01:18.897]  They got it a few hours off in New Zealand and Australia and Thailand and it was on the paper that Lee Harvey Oswald done it.
[01:01:18.897 --> 01:01:20.639]  Case closed, folks!
[01:01:20.639 --> 01:01:22.620]  The government screws up on time zones.
[01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:25.843]  Their operatives screw up because they keep these operations very small.
[01:01:25.843 --> 01:01:28.466]  They got a lot of work and a lot of things to do and their minions make mistakes.
[01:01:29.375 --> 01:01:43.143]  That's why this is a big deal, and boy, you can even hear the host going, it is very strange, I have a feeling, oh... I mean, you could tell that some of the humanity was coming out, but not that guy from New York where he sounded just like, just totally disgusting.
[01:01:43.143 --> 01:01:56.891]  Well, he still thinks that Oswald is the lone shooter, and it's kind of funny that you mention that paper that reported him as the killer prior to the assassination, because our good friend Jonathan over at We Are Change Colorado actually got that from eBay a few years back, so he has that cover.
[01:01:56.891 --> 01:01:57.372]  I've seen it.
[01:01:58.092 --> 01:01:59.513]  Pretty wild, folks.
[01:01:59.513 --> 01:02:05.335]  But yeah, I mean, if you look at what Wyke said, he said, well, you know, this building, everybody knew it was going to collapse.
[01:02:05.335 --> 01:02:07.816]  That's why they put this collapse zone around the building.
[01:02:07.816 --> 01:02:11.837]  No, they put the collapse zone there because they knew they were bringing the building down.
[01:02:11.837 --> 01:02:12.958]  A few people knew.
[01:02:12.958 --> 01:02:15.238]  Now, we're not saying the firefighters did this.
[01:02:15.238 --> 01:02:20.620]  Obviously, the New York Fire Department didn't go in there on that morning and rig the building up for demolition.
[01:02:20.620 --> 01:02:25.042]  But because we only have a few specialized controlled demolition
[01:02:25.715 --> 01:02:27.176]  But how would the government get in there?
[01:02:27.176 --> 01:02:29.897]  The government leased the entire building.
[01:02:29.897 --> 01:02:31.337]  CIA, Defense Intelligence?
[01:02:31.337 --> 01:02:32.458]  Well, let's look at what's in there.
[01:02:32.458 --> 01:02:36.960]  First of all, we have the largest Secret Service office in the world.
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:38.120]  Think about that, folks.
[01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:45.223]  The people that are in charge of protecting the President and the upper echelons of the administration, the shadow government, that's the Secret Service.
[01:02:45.223 --> 01:02:48.224]  And why is their largest field office in New York City?
[01:02:48.224 --> 01:02:51.185]  Because Manhattan is the business capital of the world.
[01:02:51.185 --> 01:02:54.927]  Then you have the largest CIA base outside of Virginia there.
[01:02:55.247 --> 01:02:55.628]  The building!
[01:03:06.570 --> 01:03:09.272]  The building had another superstructure built inside.
[01:03:09.272 --> 01:03:11.193]  It was built like an armored compound.
[01:03:11.193 --> 01:03:13.935]  And it was hooked into the Pentagon 24-7.
[01:03:13.935 --> 01:03:17.998]  It also had blueprints of every single building in New York City in it.
[01:03:17.998 --> 01:03:20.340]  So these people are constantly wired to the Pentagon.
[01:03:20.340 --> 01:03:22.121]  They have blueprints of the entire city.
[01:03:22.121 --> 01:03:23.562]  This is their office of emergency management.
[01:03:23.562 --> 01:03:25.944]  They clearly ran the attacks from there, then they blew up the evidence.
[01:03:26.304 --> 01:03:28.285]  Well, they did something there, and they wanted something done.
[01:03:28.285 --> 01:03:37.069]  I mean, when you have the Department of Defense, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Internal Revenue Services, all is almost like side ops there, not even the main ops.
[01:03:37.069 --> 01:03:42.091]  And then you know that the CIA had other intelligence offices in World Trade Center 1 and 2.
[01:03:42.911 --> 01:03:47.517]  Folks, do you think that the government is going to let a private corporation run security there?
[01:03:47.517 --> 01:03:47.817]  No!
[01:03:47.817 --> 01:03:50.140]  Kroll is obviously an intelligence front!
[01:03:50.140 --> 01:03:51.621]  Yeah, Marvin Bush.
[01:03:51.621 --> 01:03:54.244]  Yeah, Marvin Bush of Securicom and Stratasec.
[01:03:54.244 --> 01:03:55.506]  I mean, you look at who's running that.
[01:03:55.506 --> 01:03:58.429]  And then his mommy writes a book about how he was there running security.
[01:03:58.429 --> 01:03:58.749]  Yeah.
[01:03:58.749 --> 01:04:00.912]  It was his last day at work, the contract ended.
[01:04:01.292 --> 01:04:03.875]  They're even in the contracts when they blow it up!
[01:04:03.875 --> 01:04:16.487]  It's unbelievable, and when you look at who Kroll had the foresight to hire as the head of World Trade Center Security right before the attacks, they hired John O'Neill, who had his investigations into bin Laden and others stifled.
[01:04:16.487 --> 01:04:21.913]  He quits the FBI in protest, and they move him in like one or two days before the attacks, and he's killed, Alex!
[01:04:22.737 --> 01:04:23.337]  Case closed.
[01:04:23.337 --> 01:04:27.239]  I mean, they silenced a guy that's gonna go public after 9-11, so he can't.
[01:04:27.239 --> 01:04:30.080]  And by the way, there was another Secret Service agent shooting his mouth off.
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:32.320]  He's found... he was dead in Building 7.
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:34.641]  And firefighters report they'd opened doors in the buildings.
[01:04:34.641 --> 01:04:36.142]  There were dead bodies all over.
[01:04:36.142 --> 01:04:39.383]  Whoever they wanted to kill, they just took, capped in the head, and blew the buildings up.
[01:04:39.383 --> 01:04:42.384]  But according to the BBC yesterday, nobody died in Building 7.
[01:04:42.384 --> 01:04:45.105]  Mainline reports they found bodies in Building 7, folks.
[01:04:45.105 --> 01:04:46.145]  But they said I'm a liar.
[01:04:46.145 --> 01:04:47.105]  Doesn't matter.
[01:04:47.105 --> 01:04:48.446]  We'll be right back with Dr. Len Horowitz.
[01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:52.522]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:04:52.522 --> 01:04:56.146]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:04:56.146 --> 01:04:58.469]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:04:58.469 --> 01:05:01.633]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:05:01.633 --> 01:05:07.379]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[01:05:07.379 --> 01:05:11.284]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[01:06:50.672 --> 01:06:56.494]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[01:06:56.494 --> 01:07:01.936]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[01:07:01.936 --> 01:07:07.298]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[01:07:07.298 --> 01:07:13.220]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and loss of weight.
[01:07:13.220 --> 01:07:17.482]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life,
[01:07:17.682 --> 01:07:19.423]  Most people are overly acidic.
[01:07:19.423 --> 01:07:23.226]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[01:07:23.226 --> 01:07:28.050]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[01:07:28.050 --> 01:07:29.091]  Do your part.
[01:07:29.091 --> 01:07:31.713]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now!
[01:07:31.713 --> 01:07:37.838]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink
[01:07:37.978 --> 01:07:43.479]  In your sermon, you said the government lied about inventing the HIV virus as a means of genocide against people of color.
[01:07:43.479 --> 01:07:47.300]  So I ask you, do you honestly believe your statement and those words?
[01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:50.541]  Have you read Horowitz's book, Emerging Viruses, AIDS and Ebola?
[01:08:07.466 --> 01:08:08.987]  Whoever wrote that question.
[01:08:08.987 --> 01:08:10.627]  Have you read Medical Apartheid?
[01:08:10.627 --> 01:08:15.829]  You've read it?
[01:08:15.829 --> 01:08:17.710]  No questions from the floor.
[01:08:17.710 --> 01:08:18.851]  I read different things.
[01:08:18.851 --> 01:08:31.716]  As I said to my members, if you haven't read things and you can't, based on this Tuskegee experiment and based on what has happened to Africans in this country, I believe our government is capable of doing anything.
[01:08:31.716 --> 01:08:33.417]  In fact, in fact, in fact,
[01:08:35.032 --> 01:08:47.140]  One of the responses to what Saddam Hussein had in terms of biological warfare was a non-question because all we had to do was check the sales records.
[01:08:47.140 --> 01:08:52.103]  We sold him those biological weapons that he was using against his own people.
[01:08:52.103 --> 01:09:01.529]  So any time a government can put together biological warfare to kill people and then get angry when those people use what we sold them, yes, I believe we are capable.
[01:09:06.383 --> 01:09:11.225]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:09:11.225 --> 01:09:12.806]  You want answers?
[01:09:12.806 --> 01:09:13.706]  Well, so does he.
[01:09:13.706 --> 01:09:18.548]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:09:18.548 --> 01:09:27.412]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:09:27.412 --> 01:09:32.395]  Well, Dr. Len Horowitz holds multiple medical degrees, including one from Harvard.
[01:09:32.395 --> 01:09:35.376]  He's a best-selling author, documentary filmmaker,
[01:09:36.716 --> 01:09:37.977]  Alternative Health Specialist.
[01:09:37.977 --> 01:09:39.257]  The list just goes on and on.
[01:09:39.257 --> 01:09:45.560]  A guest for many years, the last 12-13 years on this show.
[01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:47.841]  And he really doesn't need any introduction past that.
[01:09:47.841 --> 01:09:51.082]  We'll plug a lot of his websites today.
[01:09:51.082 --> 01:09:58.485]  The amount of evidence that HIV and many other soft kill type autoimmune viruses have been produced,
[01:09:59.495 --> 01:10:08.402]  Uh, that so many other, uh, cancer viruses, you name it, are put in the vaccines by design, sterilization hormones added to tetanus.
[01:10:08.402 --> 01:10:09.423]  The list goes on and on.
[01:10:09.423 --> 01:10:21.333]  And so, with his massive area of knowledge, I would ask him, I know he's gone over this millions of times, and so he tends to just skim over it quickly, but to really drill down on the 50 minutes we have with him,
[01:10:22.431 --> 01:10:33.458]  And to break down the Rockefellers, the history of bioweapons, how they funded the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, the eugenics, how they're carrying out this operation, the HIV, the AIDS.
[01:10:33.458 --> 01:10:41.423]  For people out there that don't know, because we have so many Eminem affiliates, so many listeners all the time, this is not just a rumor, this is a fact.
[01:10:41.423 --> 01:10:46.607]  And he is one of the people that's gone out and done the primary core research, and we're indebted to him for doing that.
[01:10:46.607 --> 01:10:51.430]  And regardless of what you think of Jeremiah Wright, he is right on this subject.
[01:10:52.134 --> 01:10:57.797]  And there is an awakening to this now because people have learned how many bad things have been done to us.
[01:10:57.797 --> 01:11:02.780]  And this really goes to the core of the whole New World Order mindset of playing God and doing this.
[01:11:02.780 --> 01:11:06.643]  And Dr. Horowitz, of course, believes their operations, and I believe it too, killed his mother.
[01:11:06.643 --> 01:11:07.723]  We've gone from 1 in 33 with cancer to 1 in 3.
[01:11:10.133 --> 01:11:10.754]  Just everything.
[01:11:10.754 --> 01:11:14.897]  It's just genetic engineering, killing all the rats it's fed to.
[01:11:14.897 --> 01:11:16.758]  They still give us the food to eat.
[01:11:16.758 --> 01:11:18.119]  Just pandemics are upon us.
[01:11:18.119 --> 01:11:19.441]  The plagues are upon us.
[01:11:19.441 --> 01:11:21.102]  The media just whitewashes it.
[01:11:21.102 --> 01:11:23.043]  The local doctors are compartmentalized.
[01:11:23.043 --> 01:11:25.565]  Dr. Horowitz, it's great to have you on with us.
[01:11:25.565 --> 01:11:26.746]  Always a pleasure.
[01:11:26.746 --> 01:11:29.028]  Thank you for inviting me, Alex.
[01:11:29.028 --> 01:11:34.032]  First off, fire out websites, contact points, how people get your books that cover this.
[01:11:34.032 --> 01:11:36.734]  And then, please, get into the facts for people.
[01:11:38.027 --> 01:11:41.149]  Well, the website is drlenhorowitz.com.
[01:11:41.149 --> 01:11:47.792]  That's d-r-l-e-n-h-o-r-o-w-i-t-z dot com.
[01:11:47.792 --> 01:11:49.052]  That's my official website.
[01:11:49.052 --> 01:11:58.357]  We've got links to probably about three dozen websites now that we've been involved in trying to educate the public regarding exactly what you do so brilliantly.
[01:11:58.357 --> 01:12:04.820]  The New World Order, the manipulation of the population by the military, medical, petrochemical, pharmaceutical cartel.
[01:12:05.746 --> 01:12:14.829]  My most recent documentary film, and I give it to you to just make as many copies for free and give them out to everybody as possible.
[01:12:14.829 --> 01:12:16.650]  It's called In Lies We Trust.
[01:12:16.650 --> 01:12:18.430]  It's on Google now for free.
[01:12:18.430 --> 01:12:20.191]  The whole thing is two and a half hours.
[01:12:20.191 --> 01:12:22.672]  It's on YouTube in 16 segments.
[01:12:22.672 --> 01:12:31.195]  In Lies We Trust is really what Reverend Wright was also referring to when he cited the documentation that proves Saddam Hussein
[01:12:32.055 --> 01:12:40.443]  Had sent to him, shipped to him from the American-type culture collection in the United States, the biological weapons he used against his own people.
[01:12:40.443 --> 01:12:45.748]  So that this is the great source for educating the public.
[01:12:45.748 --> 01:12:47.750]  It's called In Lies We Trust.
[01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:56.979]  You can go to inlieswetrust.com, or like I said, you can go to drlenhorowitz.com and then connect via that website to all of our websites.
[01:12:58.823 --> 01:13:11.009]  Let's start at the beginning with an abbreviated breakdown of their mindset, who they are, the last hundred years of hundreds of millions murdered by these people, and then how they even run the hospitals to then make the profits off of it.
[01:13:11.009 --> 01:13:13.210]  Break that down and then let's get specifically into HIV.
[01:13:14.705 --> 01:13:23.228]  Well, I think you're very wise to look at history, otherwise the history repeats itself and the genocide operations continue.
[01:13:23.228 --> 01:13:34.431]  You know, I think for this history of HIV and the eugenics and genetics movement and the manipulation of the viruses in laboratories, you have to go back.
[01:13:34.431 --> 01:13:43.494]  I think the furthest you want to go back probably is the Rothschild cartel, the banking cartel of Europe that funded the Rockefellers, and I'm probably
[01:13:43.994 --> 01:13:51.977]  I mean, there's a lot of evidence coming out more all the time that these people are blood linkages.
[01:13:51.977 --> 01:14:11.925]  There's blood linkages to the old European banksters, the Rothschild family, the Rockefellers, the royalty of Europe, and that ultimately it was the Rockefeller family that started the genetics industry in the United States, and largely centered at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories and Rockefeller University.
[01:14:12.930 --> 01:14:17.135]  Was the funding of genetics, or it was originally called eugenics?
[01:14:17.739 --> 01:14:29.169]  The scientific investigation of genetic differences between the races that included the genetic predispositions for diseases between the races, so that you could develop ethnic weapons.
[01:14:29.169 --> 01:14:36.936]  And that was funded by the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds, ultimately the Bush family.
[01:14:36.936 --> 01:14:40.139]  Prescott Bush was a main player.
[01:14:40.139 --> 01:14:43.762]  The Whitney's, the Carnegie's, the Vanderbilts.
[01:14:44.182 --> 01:14:53.504]  These people were extremely concerned about burgeoning populations, immigrant populations having popular uprisings and labor revolts.
[01:14:53.504 --> 01:14:56.325]  That would shake their status quo.
[01:14:56.325 --> 01:15:03.827]  So they were developing technologies to control populations way back, even in the early 1900s.
[01:15:03.827 --> 01:15:10.048]  And I know most people find that hard to believe, but this is extremely well-documented history and science.
[01:15:10.048 --> 01:15:13.469]  And then, you have to look at, I did a book a couple years ago.
[01:15:14.494 --> 01:15:15.275]  We're good to go.
[01:15:37.535 --> 01:15:45.141]  And it's now admitted that for 35 years everybody at birth has their blood taken.
[01:15:45.141 --> 01:15:47.863]  Now Homeland Security says they own it.
[01:15:47.863 --> 01:15:49.965]  They admit that they're doing all of this.
[01:15:49.965 --> 01:15:58.791]  The head of Cold Springs Harbor, formerly the Eugenics Records Office, Dr. Watson, who discovered the double helix, just said black people weren't human and had to step down.
[01:15:58.791 --> 01:16:00.753]  So, another example of how they're everywhere.
[01:16:01.697 --> 01:16:02.478]  Exactly.
[01:16:02.478 --> 01:16:07.401]  You know, and you've been at the forefront of heralding these realities, tragedies.
[01:16:07.401 --> 01:16:18.307]  But, you know, I think now we're starting to see more and more people like Reverend Wright are truth-tellers because of the work that we've been doing, you know?
[01:16:18.307 --> 01:16:18.848]  Absolutely.
[01:16:18.848 --> 01:16:19.428]  Please continue.
[01:16:20.350 --> 01:16:31.480]  Well, so that, you know, you now take, you go back to 1968 with HIV AIDS, and you see in the congressional record that George H.W.
[01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:37.166]  Bush, before he was CIA director, was congressman in Texas, stood up before the United States Congress,
[01:16:37.746 --> 01:16:43.390]  Right beside his father, Prescott Bush's best friend, William Draper III.
[01:16:43.390 --> 01:16:49.694]  These were two of the premier eugenicists funding Cold Spring Harbor eugenics programs.
[01:16:49.694 --> 01:16:52.436]  And William Draper III and George H.W.
[01:16:52.436 --> 01:17:02.103]  Bush pleaded to the United States Congress that we have to put a stop to burgeoning third world populations, particularly the African populations.
[01:17:02.603 --> 01:17:04.224]  It was considered a major U.S.
[01:17:04.224 --> 01:17:06.606]  national security and economic threat.
[01:17:06.606 --> 01:17:14.112]  So literally, in 1968, you can go into the congressional record like we did, and you can pull the speech that George H.W.
[01:17:14.112 --> 01:17:17.895]  Bush gave that called for massive third-world depopulation.
[01:17:17.895 --> 01:17:23.179]  And all of that is repeated in State Department Memorandum 200 by Kissinger just five years later.
[01:17:23.852 --> 01:17:24.352]  Exactly.
[01:17:24.352 --> 01:17:29.536]  Well, actually, it was five years approximately later that that report started.
[01:17:29.536 --> 01:17:39.122]  Kissinger's National Security Memorandum 200, which is extremely important, along with National Security Memorandum 42 that specifically targeted black people.
[01:17:40.643 --> 01:17:44.985]  And that was a part of the COINTELPRO and the FBI manipulations.
[01:17:44.985 --> 01:18:08.380]  But the critical time in history in the White House that HIV-AIDS was actually selected as an option by Kissinger was when he took over as National Security Advisor under Richard Nixon and almost immediately ordered Melvin Laird to do a reassessment of America's biological weapons capabilities.
[01:18:09.364 --> 01:18:27.001]  And that, at the time, the President's appointee over American industry in the Nixon White House, who was thought to be given the post that he gave ultimately to Kissinger, was Roy Ash.
[01:18:27.001 --> 01:18:34.268]  Today, if you do your research, you'll find that Roy Ash is one of the premier fundraisers for the Republican Party.
[01:18:35.094 --> 01:18:41.099]  Roy Ash was President Nixon's appointee to run American industry.
[01:18:41.099 --> 01:18:49.025]  And he was considered in the post for National Security Advisor, overseeing CIA, FBI, and foreign policy that was given to Kissinger.
[01:18:49.025 --> 01:18:58.753]  But Kissinger, who was Rockefeller, Nelson Rockefeller's protégé... Yeah, he's got that special Rockefeller-funded PhD that only one person gets a year.
[01:18:59.580 --> 01:19:25.087]  Right, and the reason why we have nuclear weapons deployed around the face of the planet, as well as biological weapons, now hideous like HIV-AIDS and others, is because it was the Rockefeller, Nelson Rockefeller, that appointed Henry Kissinger to run the Council on Foreign Relations Nuclear Weapons Study Group, and then published in the Council on Foreign Relations journal called Foreign Affairs, the most politically esteemed journal,
[01:19:25.945 --> 01:19:27.686]  It is a big idea.
[01:19:27.686 --> 01:19:28.547]  A new world order.
[01:19:55.091 --> 01:19:59.975]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[01:19:59.975 --> 01:20:02.817]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:20:02.817 --> 01:20:05.599]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:20:05.599 --> 01:20:08.782]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:20:08.782 --> 01:20:16.108]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:20:19.124 --> 01:20:24.568]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:20:24.568 --> 01:20:27.970]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:20:49.865 --> 01:20:50.025]  Yeah.
[01:21:06.098 --> 01:21:10.059]  The package contains six DVDs that contain ten different programs.
[01:21:10.059 --> 01:21:13.981]  Two books that combined are over a thousand pages and other information.

[01:21:43.695 --> 01:21:45.276]  $15 for UPS ground or $30 outside the U.S.
[01:21:49.468 --> 01:21:52.330]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[01:21:52.330 --> 01:21:53.891]  Loose Change Final Cut.
[01:21:53.891 --> 01:21:56.052]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:21:56.052 --> 01:21:57.953]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[01:21:57.953 --> 01:21:59.434]  The late, great USA.
[01:21:59.434 --> 01:22:01.195]  America, freedom to fascism.
[01:22:01.195 --> 01:22:08.219]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available at truthnews.us and prisonplanet.com.

[01:22:48.643 --> 01:22:53.985]  The Federal Trade Commission estimates that 9 million Americans are victims of identity theft each year.
[01:22:53.985 --> 01:22:58.867]  The crime of identity theft occurs every 3.5 seconds, costing the victims an average of $8,000.
[01:22:58.867 --> 01:23:06.850]  If you own a PC, passwords are a common form of authentication, and often the only protection between a hacker and your personal information.
[01:23:07.170 --> 01:23:16.173]  Passwords that are stored in a spreadsheet, text file, data file, or any other file that is not encrypted and password protected are vulnerable to malicious theft and misuse.

[01:23:48.208 --> 01:23:56.774]  All right, this is a short segment.
[01:23:56.774 --> 01:23:58.476]  Let's move fast with Dr. Lynn Horowitz.
[01:23:59.915 --> 01:24:09.022]  Please continue with the history of this, and then I want to talk about the anthrax attacks, how you got an FBI visit, just how serious this is, and the risk you and I and others are taking.
[01:24:09.022 --> 01:24:14.005]  We appreciate your bravery, Dr. Horowitz, because you really are a trailblazer on this issue and many others.
[01:24:14.005 --> 01:24:15.907]  Please continue with where you left off with Kissinger.
[01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:18.241]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[01:24:18.241 --> 01:24:30.050]  Yes, the National Security Advisor post overseeing CIA, FBI, and foreign policy was vital for the Rockefeller influence throughout, really, the geopolitics.
[01:24:30.050 --> 01:24:36.776]  And Kissinger was the man, and that he selected the option within a couple weeks of him taking office.
[01:24:37.436 --> 01:24:51.388]  In that post, he selected the option to develop immune-ravaging viruses for germ warfare, and he had actually asked Admiral Zumwalt of the Navy to do a reassessment of America's biological weapons capabilities.
[01:24:51.388 --> 01:24:55.092]  The reassessment came in when he selected the option.
[01:24:55.092 --> 01:25:02.018]  He designated this man, Roy Ashe's company, as kind of like the company that was to receive
[01:25:02.518 --> 01:25:14.403]  The $2 million a year for the 1969 for 70 appropriations for the United States Defense Department's development of synthetic biological agents for germ warfare.
[01:25:14.403 --> 01:25:29.669]  And so you've got, obviously, heavily incriminating evidence that there's a political agenda to kill massive amounts of people through weapons of mass destruction, biological weapons of mass destruction, just as he's entering office.
[01:25:30.464 --> 01:25:36.746]  The links, obviously, between Rockefeller and Nixon are historically very clear.
[01:25:36.746 --> 01:25:49.530]  Well, I mean, Kissinger says in Memorandum 200, he says we're going to use food warfare, we're going to arm sides to kill each other, and we're going to pay countries to have one-child policies, and we know that China publicly accepted that.
[01:25:50.797 --> 01:25:59.309]  Well, again, I look at the whole global chessboard as a manipulative game, you know, so there's no question about it.
[01:25:59.309 --> 01:26:06.580]  In In Lives We Trust and in my publications, I show that, for example, during the height of the Cold War,
[01:26:07.563 --> 01:26:26.877]  We were shipping our National Cancer Institute researchers, including Dr. Robert Gallo, who was credited with the discovery of HIV-AIDS back in 1984, when in fact he was overseeing their development back in the late 60s, early 70s, as project officer for the National Cancer Institute, overseeing Lytton Bionetics, that's Roy Ashe's major
[01:26:28.438 --> 01:26:38.268]  Military weapons contracting firm called Linton Industries had the biological weapons contractor component called Bionetics Research Labs.
[01:26:38.268 --> 01:26:45.415]  And wasn't that just used as a front clearinghouse for other bioweapons programs being carried out by other big companies?
[01:26:45.415 --> 01:26:46.395]  Yes, that's exactly.
[01:26:46.395 --> 01:26:47.877]  It was an inside game.
[01:26:47.877 --> 01:26:51.941]  You know, the good old boys were making money during this
[01:26:52.621 --> 01:26:56.123]  Military weapons buildup and biological weaponry.
[01:26:56.123 --> 01:27:12.574]  And that Roy Ash's medical subsidiary, Bionetics, not only developed these immune system ravaging viruses for germ warfare and population control, they also held the contract to completely administer the National Cancer Institute.
[01:27:12.574 --> 01:27:14.175]  They ran all the programs.
[01:27:15.816 --> 01:27:25.814]  They paid all the employees, they administered all the money, all the programs going through the National Cancer Institute at the time that it took over Fort Detrick, Maryland.
[01:27:26.405 --> 01:27:36.877]  That was America's premier biological weapons testing center that Nixon came in and said, we're now turning swords into plowshares by making this the new home of the National Cancer Institute.
[01:27:36.877 --> 01:27:44.084]  Using the Cancer Institute as the front, but going back 80 years before, the Rockefellers were obsessed with cancer and how to spread it as well.
[01:27:44.084 --> 01:27:45.566]  I've seen the documents on that.
[01:27:45.566 --> 01:27:46.267]  Real bastards.
[01:27:47.297 --> 01:27:51.380]  And incredible to the level that, I mean, we got the documentation.
[01:27:51.380 --> 01:28:01.287]  Can you imagine taking leukemia viruses and recombining them with influenza viruses so that you can spread cancer like a flu?
[01:28:01.287 --> 01:28:03.349]  And then still most Americans don't know that most
[01:28:03.869 --> 01:28:08.452]  Cancer is viral and that they brought this to us, but the proof's in the pudding.
[01:28:08.452 --> 01:28:11.033]  1 in 3 getting cancer from 1 in 33?
[01:28:11.033 --> 01:28:14.014]  My God, Doc, they really are hitting us hard.
[01:28:14.014 --> 01:28:28.002]  They are, and again, many of those viruses that they were injecting into populations, human populations from various species, Epstein-Barr virus, that's a cancer trigger, it's an immune-compromising cancer
[01:28:35.269 --> 01:28:36.050]  Exactly, folks.
[01:28:36.050 --> 01:28:43.397]  The chronic fatigue is these bioweapons, soft kills, hitting you, and then your body finally gives up and lets it replicate.
[01:28:43.397 --> 01:28:44.698]  And there's no doubt about all this.
[01:28:44.698 --> 01:28:45.860]  These are some sick freaks.
[01:28:46.740 --> 01:28:56.629]  And you see that the chemtrails and the pollution and the contamination of the water and the food and the air, it's all part of what's called the Russian biological cocktail method.
[01:28:56.629 --> 01:29:00.011]  I suppose it's called that because the Americans likely invented it.
[01:29:00.011 --> 01:29:03.214]  The reality is that what you just said is so true.
[01:29:03.214 --> 01:29:12.482]  Once your immune system gives way to the chemicals, then these biological, these viral agents can kick in and deliver the knockout punch.
[01:29:12.902 --> 01:29:15.204]  Meanwhile, they've done the research for a hundred years.
[01:29:15.204 --> 01:29:18.186]  They have the treatments and cures for themselves.
[01:29:18.186 --> 01:29:21.069]  And you'll always read about how these elitists now live out in the country.
[01:29:21.069 --> 01:29:23.210]  They're obsessed with everything being purified.
[01:29:23.210 --> 01:29:24.391]  No GMO.
[01:29:24.391 --> 01:29:27.014]  While they own the companies, forcing GMO on us.
[01:29:27.014 --> 01:29:28.175]  Stay there, Dr. Len Horowitz.
[01:29:28.175 --> 01:29:29.596]  I want to continue this.
[01:29:29.596 --> 01:29:31.377]  Listen to me, police officers.
[01:29:31.377 --> 01:29:34.620]  You have been implanted with cancer viruses.
[01:29:34.620 --> 01:29:37.082]  The government isn't your friend.
[01:29:37.082 --> 01:29:38.403]  Be right back with Dr. Len Horowitz.
[01:29:41.161 --> 01:29:45.072]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:29:45.072 --> 01:29:47.780]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:52.566 --> 01:29:53.927]  I'm Harold Williams.
[01:29:53.927 --> 01:29:56.010]  I know about martial law.
[01:29:56.010 --> 01:29:57.891]  I want to teach you how to survive it.
[01:29:57.891 --> 01:30:06.860]  America has 10 telling signs of martial law, so use the short time left to learn to protect your family with the vital information in this book.

[01:30:09.623 --> 01:30:13.087]  I will tell you what you need to know to prepare for martial law.
[01:30:13.087 --> 01:30:14.348]  Things are changing fast.
[01:30:14.648 --> 01:30:17.470]  We even email you a free weekly update.
[01:30:17.470 --> 01:30:24.855]  I teach you how to act around troops, where to put supplies, how to be safe during the worst part of martial law, which is in the beginning.
[01:30:24.855 --> 01:30:28.898]  Surviving this major life transition can be difficult, but possible.
[01:30:28.898 --> 01:30:33.862]  Arm yourself with the knowledge, as this is the only weapon you will have to protect your family.

[01:30:40.527 --> 01:30:41.147]  Protect your family!
[01:30:50.885 --> 01:30:53.406]  Hi, this is Dave from Ready Reserve Foods.
[01:30:53.406 --> 01:31:00.768]  I have been waiting patiently for the government and mainstream media to inform you of what is turning out to be the biggest problem facing the world in the last 50 years.
[01:31:00.768 --> 01:31:06.350]  For the last three years, the Earth has consumed more food than it has been able to produce, and it has now finally caught up with this.
[01:31:06.350 --> 01:31:13.293]  In the U.S., commodities such as flour and rice are already being rationed, and the next rice crop won't be available for another four to five months.
[01:31:13.293 --> 01:31:19.895]  It's fall in the Southern Hemisphere, and many countries are short the food necessary to make it through the winter and have stopped exporting certain commodities altogether.
[01:31:20.700 --> 01:31:22.281]  Remember our trade deficit?
[01:31:22.281 --> 01:31:28.145]  Trillions of dollars have stacked up outside the country and are now rushing in to buy our food production at any price.
[01:31:28.145 --> 01:31:34.529]  By late summer, if not early fall, it is likely our government will step in and control food and food exports under martial law.
[01:31:34.529 --> 01:31:36.010]  Call Ready Reserve Foods at 1-800-453-2202.
[01:31:36.010 --> 01:31:36.090]  1-800-453-2202.
[01:31:36.090 --> 01:31:37.231]  Or visit us at www.readyreservefoods.com.
[01:31:37.231 --> 01:31:37.291]  1-800-453-2202.
[01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:54.802]  Hello, I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, author of 15 books on health and natural healing.
[01:31:54.802 --> 01:31:58.944]  Vaccines included, medicines kill more people every year than any illness.
[01:31:58.944 --> 01:32:05.328]  The cost of drug side effects in America is more than $200 billion annually, with the worst toll taken by antibiotics.
[01:32:05.748 --> 01:32:09.030]  But there is a cure for this medical madness that has remained secret.
[01:32:09.030 --> 01:32:18.437]  OxySilver, developed by NASA scientists to keep astronauts healthy, is an evolutionary new dietary supplement making deadly vaccinations and antibiotics obsolete.
[01:32:18.437 --> 01:32:23.101]  Taking one to two teaspoons daily boosts natural immunity without drug toxicity.
[01:32:23.101 --> 01:32:26.223]  OxySilver combines oxygen and silver in a new way.
[01:32:26.223 --> 01:32:32.328]  The oxygen becomes a supercharged germ killer, freeing your immune system to fight colds, flus, cancers and more.
[01:32:32.668 --> 01:32:39.051]  Build disease defenses naturally, painlessly, powerfully, safely, and inexpensively with OxySilver.
[01:32:39.051 --> 01:32:41.292]  Order your supply now by calling toll-free 1-877-817-9829.
[01:32:41.292 --> 01:32:41.732]  That's 1-877-817-9829.
[01:32:41.732 --> 01:32:42.072]  Do it now!
[01:33:01.508 --> 01:33:03.230]  That's the first time I've heard that ad.
[01:33:03.230 --> 01:33:04.571]  Here I am getting Dr. Horowitz on.
[01:33:04.571 --> 01:33:08.574]  I had no idea it was advertised on the network.
[01:33:08.574 --> 01:33:11.357]  I think that was his voice I was just hearing.
[01:33:11.357 --> 01:33:16.502]  Uh, small world.
[01:33:16.502 --> 01:33:19.464]  I want everybody listening to me to understand something.
[01:33:19.464 --> 01:33:21.526]  I'm at a film about the endgame.
[01:33:21.526 --> 01:33:25.590]  About the global system, their architecture, their driving force, their idea.
[01:33:28.604 --> 01:33:34.208]  And you can argue all day who runs it, who's at the top of it.
[01:33:34.208 --> 01:33:43.395]  But there's no debate what they're doing, there's no debate that Ted Turner's come out and said we need a one-child policy, taxes on you if you have more than one kid.
[01:33:43.395 --> 01:33:47.198]  I told you they were gonna do that.
[01:33:47.198 --> 01:33:50.261]  He calls us useless eaters, useless feeders.
[01:33:50.261 --> 01:33:54.924]  Professors give speeches saying 90% of us need to die now, and they get standing ovations.
[01:33:54.924 --> 01:33:57.306]  I mean, for three minutes, people just cheering and praising.
[01:33:58.044 --> 01:34:01.446]  They love death.
[01:34:01.446 --> 01:34:08.310]  And a lot of good old boys out there saying, good, there are too many blacks, kill them with bioweapons.
[01:34:08.310 --> 01:34:10.251]  I want to be clear.
[01:34:10.251 --> 01:34:20.056]  In my neighborhood, where I previously lived, in one year, in just one street, two three-year-olds died of leukemia.
[01:34:20.056 --> 01:34:25.700]  There are young people everywhere getting Alzheimer's when they're 35, dying of cancer when they're 20.
[01:34:26.733 --> 01:34:33.179]  Last year they reported a six-fold increase in women's lung cancer and said it was smoking, but smoking's been down for 20 years.
[01:34:33.179 --> 01:34:38.785]  Uh, and you turn out that there's a virus's quote that accidentally infected vaccines that cause lung cancer.
[01:34:38.785 --> 01:34:44.230]  Uh, you go from 1 in 125, uh, excuse me, 1 in 25,000 20 years ago getting autism, now 125, 2 years ago last year, 1 in 87.
[01:34:52.558 --> 01:35:01.466]  Uh, and don't tell me it's over-reporting because I take my kids to see a movie like Ratatouille and there's two rows of kids in wheelchairs who are autistic.
[01:35:01.466 --> 01:35:07.971]  You know, it's just, the schools, huge facilities at every public school for these poor children.
[01:35:07.971 --> 01:35:10.073]  It's just hell on earth, ladies and gentlemen, and...
[01:35:10.999 --> 01:35:13.300]  My God, I can't believe they're hitting us so hard.
[01:35:13.300 --> 01:35:35.147]  Dr. Horowitz, continuing with their program, their plan, with the HIV, and that from the evidence I have and from reading, it is really just a cover term for a whole family of these, and your film and Lies We Trust also gets into the monkeys, how they took bioweapon experiment monkeys and made the vaccines, and they have the famous inventors of vaccines admitting it.
[01:35:35.147 --> 01:35:36.788]  I mean, it's so admitted!
[01:35:37.368 --> 01:35:49.438]  I want people to realize, driving around in their cars, that, I mean, most of you have already been implanted with something that's going to kill you, and it's designed, like Logan's Run, to kick in later in life.
[01:35:49.438 --> 01:35:52.440]  It's really a malfunction when it kills you when you're young.
[01:35:52.440 --> 01:35:54.501]  Or do you disagree with any of those statements, Dr. Horowitz?
[01:35:54.501 --> 01:35:56.063]  No, you're absolutely right, Alex.
[01:35:56.063 --> 01:36:01.087]  And you know, the OxySilver commercial that we just heard, that's another great example.
[01:36:01.087 --> 01:36:03.929]  NASA scientists developed this type of a product.
[01:36:05.159 --> 01:36:08.141]  20 years ago to keep astronauts healthy.
[01:36:08.141 --> 01:36:09.501]  It's a silver hydrosol.
[01:36:09.501 --> 01:36:10.742]  It's not a colloidal silver.
[01:36:10.742 --> 01:36:12.623]  It has nothing to do with colloidal silver.
[01:36:12.623 --> 01:36:30.772]  It is a totally amazing, advanced product that was developed by the government to protect astronauts in space where hydration levels are vitally important, as well as the whole concept of infectious disease control in space, and that they suppress this.
[01:36:32.319 --> 01:36:42.566]  I can tell you something, that this product currently sells for $800 for an 8-ounce bottle from these drug industrialists.
[01:36:42.566 --> 01:36:49.852]  And so what we've been blessed with now is the opportunity to get this protection out to humanity, and the product is called OxySilver.
[01:36:49.852 --> 01:36:57.598]  People should go to onlineoxysilver.com and check it out, because when you realize the science of the suppression,
[01:37:00.420 --> 01:37:11.051]  Absolutely, and I mean there's so many other things, like one fish oil company's gone out and gotten FDA approval, and then they sell a $10 bottle for $300.
[01:37:11.051 --> 01:37:13.554]  It's just so amazing what they do.
[01:37:13.554 --> 01:37:16.396]  So I mean, getting back to this, I mean there's so many facets.
[01:37:16.396 --> 01:37:17.738]  Give people the bottom line on this.
[01:37:18.544 --> 01:37:22.787]  Well, the concept is, again, you can easily kill HIV.
[01:37:22.787 --> 01:37:25.188]  You could kill all these infectious diseases.
[01:37:25.188 --> 01:37:27.810]  Humanity does not need to suffer like this.
[01:37:27.810 --> 01:37:35.235]  And that these drug industrialists and the political puppets whose strings they pull with their special interest donations ultimately
[01:37:35.875 --> 01:37:39.857]  ...are causing genocide, and this is what Reverend Wright was talking about.
[01:37:39.857 --> 01:37:50.702]  The genocide is strictly defined in Webster's Dictionary as the mass killing or enslaving of people for profit, politics, or ideology.
[01:37:50.702 --> 01:38:02.767]  And if you look at the way our American culture today has evolved, largely because of the drug industrialists, the most powerful political lobby, we're all popping magic pills and then expecting all these side effects.
[01:38:03.127 --> 01:38:08.088]  In other words, they've created not a human, but a totally diseased population.
[01:38:08.088 --> 01:38:09.829]  Give us the bottom line on Gardasil.
[01:38:09.829 --> 01:38:11.970]  They admit it doesn't cover you for the virus.
[01:38:11.970 --> 01:38:13.930]  They admit it doesn't help it.
[01:38:13.930 --> 01:38:18.892]  If you have the common virus, then it gives you a 45% increase in actually getting the cancer.
[01:38:18.892 --> 01:38:20.532]  Their own insert says that.
[01:38:20.532 --> 01:38:21.652]  It's a live virus.
[01:38:21.652 --> 01:38:23.213]  It's killed a bunch of people.
[01:38:23.213 --> 01:38:26.734]  It's Merck, the same people involved in bioweapons programs.
[01:38:26.734 --> 01:38:30.155]  Yes, can we trust the Merck company to give us anything better than Vioxx?
[01:38:31.966 --> 01:38:35.488]  That's what killed and maimed millions of people.
[01:38:35.488 --> 01:38:38.350]  They pulled it off the market last week in the headline news.
[01:38:38.350 --> 01:38:42.873]  It showed that the government malfeasance and officials were involved in this genocide.
[01:38:42.873 --> 01:38:43.954]  And by the way, they knew
[01:38:44.924 --> 01:38:45.545]  That it was bad.
[01:38:45.545 --> 01:39:06.463]  They also know that the human papillomavirus, Gardasil, is bad, but by paying off Governor Perry, when a state governor, and you're a doctor, you can talk about this, when a state governor orders a health department to make it, quote, mandatory, which it really isn't, it's just color of law, it's, quote, recommended, then federal law kicks in to give them total liability protection.
[01:39:06.463 --> 01:39:07.104]  They know.
[01:39:07.104 --> 01:39:08.185]  I mean, tell us about Gardasil.
[01:39:09.099 --> 01:39:12.401]  Again, it's exactly as you say, it's a cancer trigger.
[01:39:12.401 --> 01:39:13.522]  That's all this is doing.
[01:39:13.522 --> 01:39:17.004]  Again, when you think about... The insert says it!
[01:39:17.004 --> 01:39:18.084]  Yeah.
[01:39:18.084 --> 01:39:20.906]  I mean, again, this is ridiculous.
[01:39:20.906 --> 01:39:33.874]  All it is, is the mainstream media is being a mouthpiece for British Secret Service and Central Intelligence that's operating as the Gestapo on behalf of the military, medical, petrochemical, pharmaceutical cartel.
[01:39:34.654 --> 01:39:50.937]  The pharmaceuticals are the grossest genocidal scam, and modern medicine is nothing but virtual Manchurian candidates gathered together to usher people into the modern concentration camps called hospitals.
[01:39:50.937 --> 01:39:57.839]  Now, just going back here to the Gardasil, they always have sick jokes in the terms they use.
[01:39:57.839 --> 01:39:59.279]  One less.
[01:39:59.279 --> 01:40:03.380]  Oh, it's one less who have the cancer, but they mean something else by one less.
[01:40:04.688 --> 01:40:13.819]  You know what, let's skip ahead to the end and then go back over some more details and talk about the book that Dr. Wright was talking about that people can get, the latest edition from you, and I recommend they do, Dr. Horowitz.
[01:40:13.819 --> 01:40:20.688]  Skipping ahead, from their own documents that you've researched, that I've researched, and I know I can concur with the info you brought up because I've researched it myself, very credible.
[01:40:21.511 --> 01:40:22.852]  What is their endgame?
[01:40:22.852 --> 01:40:35.019]  In their perfect world, if they're able to carry all these plans out, we know AIDS is just a test of stronger systems, we know they're openly writing policy papers about releasing airborne Ebola, what do we do?
[01:40:35.019 --> 01:40:39.262]  A souped-up hyper-Ebola and other nasties, what do we do?
[01:40:39.262 --> 01:40:45.146]  Billions spent, well now Bush says $6 billion for BioShield, 36 level 4 bioweapons labs, super
[01:40:45.626 --> 01:40:51.969]  Well, there's no question that the depopulation agenda is currently targeting at least half, if not two-thirds, of the world's population to be eliminated.
[01:41:14.855 --> 01:41:35.803]  And so the question becomes is if you have ears to hear this kind of truth and take the precautionary steps needed to reduce your risks, and that takes lifestyle changes, you've got to detox, deacidify, that is alkalize your body, chemistry, utilizing products that oxygenate, that deliver the kind of silver hydrosol protection that we're now talking about.
[01:41:36.443 --> 01:41:44.512]  We're looking at bioenergetics, everything from hands-on healing and prayer, because this is really ultimately spiritual warfare.
[01:41:44.512 --> 01:41:50.940]  The protection that Reverend Wright was talking about, he serves the Creator, the boss, it's the same protector.
[01:41:51.881 --> 01:41:54.224]  Well, let me stop you.
[01:41:54.224 --> 01:41:57.349]  I mean, you've got a medical degree from Harvard.
[01:41:57.349 --> 01:41:59.272]  You're not playing games here.
[01:41:59.272 --> 01:42:02.437]  All the major studies show that prayer works.
[01:42:02.437 --> 01:42:05.461]  And then the psychologists say, well, because you believe.
[01:42:05.461 --> 01:42:06.442]  Regardless, it works.
[01:42:06.963 --> 01:42:09.584]  Well, look at placebo and look at nocebo.
[01:42:09.584 --> 01:42:24.748]  If you could take a room full of 100 healthy people and tell them, walk in with your white lab coat and stethoscope and say to them, you're dying of HIV AIDS, and have the opposite of placebo, which cures people who are terminally ill, 30% of them, by that belief,
[01:42:27.193 --> 01:42:36.268]  Likewise, you can point a finger at somebody, a group of 100 people, and say you're dying of cancer and have 30% of that room dead exactly when you say they're going to die.
[01:42:36.268 --> 01:42:38.472]  And then have the treatment is what actually kills them.
[01:42:39.398 --> 01:42:43.902]  Yes, and make money from it, profiteering off of humanity's suffering.
[01:42:43.902 --> 01:42:46.163]  That is the genocidal game of the drug industry.
[01:42:46.163 --> 01:42:56.091]  Well, I want to be clear, we've had medical doctors on, we've had women on who almost died, and read the AP report where they did die from it, within days of it being approved last year, and now it's just massive numbers.
[01:42:56.091 --> 01:42:57.712]  It says in the handout
[01:42:58.596 --> 01:43:06.705]  That this increases cancer risk if you already have the virus, which about half of adult women have, and about 15% of children have.
[01:43:06.705 --> 01:43:08.226]  You know, it's just the basic warrant.
[01:43:08.226 --> 01:43:08.687]  It's everywhere.
[01:43:08.687 --> 01:43:09.267]  It's in the dirt.
[01:43:09.267 --> 01:43:09.828]  It's in the air.
[01:43:09.828 --> 01:43:14.913]  I mean, they admit it's a cancer trigger in their own handout, Doc.
[01:43:14.913 --> 01:43:16.955]  It's the cancer solution.
[01:43:16.955 --> 01:43:19.899]  The cancer trigger is a cancer solution for population.
[01:43:20.519 --> 01:43:21.580]  That's what this is.
[01:43:21.580 --> 01:43:35.690]  All this is is an intoxication agenda, where they're intoxicating humanity with these pathogens, both chemical and biological, which ultimately is reducing the population most profitably and covertly.
[01:43:35.690 --> 01:43:36.751]  Our precious women.
[01:43:36.751 --> 01:43:40.373]  Boy, they really go after the women.
[01:43:40.373 --> 01:43:47.178]  Well, you know, it's again, they're going after anybody that doesn't have the common sense and the time to research and read.
[01:43:48.228 --> 01:43:49.568]  God, they're bastards.
[01:43:49.568 --> 01:43:56.370]  How can the public not wake up when 1 in 3 are dying of cancer now from 1 in 33 official government numbers?
[01:43:56.370 --> 01:44:14.495]  Well, I think that the public, I mean, like, you take a look at even CNN Larry King a couple weeks ago when the final government admission, and that was a whole, a spin, the whole propaganda that came out with the vaccines are inducing the autistic spectrum disorder through the mercury toxicity, and the final government admission that just came out
[01:44:14.955 --> 01:44:17.697]  Well, the Pauling family were shills.
[01:44:17.697 --> 01:44:27.903]  They were set, this whole thing was a public relations campaign, in essence, to do exactly what mainstream media is currently doing on prime time with the advertisements.
[01:44:27.903 --> 01:44:38.229]  They're saying, well, pop these magic pills to cure every ill and don't be surprised in its normal life to have all these side effects and diseases develop as a result of taking the pharmaceuticals.
[01:44:38.229 --> 01:44:41.751]  Yeah, they're making its celebrity kind of cool to have an autistic kid.
[01:44:42.483 --> 01:44:46.407]  Yeah, and to have them, this is what they're doing.
[01:44:46.407 --> 01:44:48.149]  They're changing the culture.
[01:44:48.149 --> 01:44:49.891]  Yeah, the culture is where it's supposed to be.
[01:44:49.891 --> 01:44:50.892]  Behavioral engineering.
[01:44:50.892 --> 01:44:51.412]  Exactly.
[01:44:51.412 --> 01:44:54.856]  Hey, five-year-olds are supposed to die of brain tumors and leukemia.
[01:44:54.856 --> 01:44:56.037]  That's exactly what they're doing.
[01:44:56.037 --> 01:44:56.918]  Hey, you're supposed to.
[01:44:56.918 --> 01:44:58.139]  It's cool.
[01:44:58.139 --> 01:44:59.280]  It's fun.
[01:44:59.280 --> 01:45:00.662]  It's normal.
[01:45:00.662 --> 01:45:01.843]  Exactly right.
[01:45:01.843 --> 01:45:05.667]  And so that's the absolute insanity of this.
[01:45:06.407 --> 01:45:11.548]  Now, to be clear, your average doctor, though, is compartmentalized.
[01:45:11.548 --> 01:45:12.849]  They're told what to do.
[01:45:12.849 --> 01:45:15.829]  The HMO now on computers tells them what treatment to do.
[01:45:15.829 --> 01:45:23.231]  They mean well, and that's why this evil continues, because they're compartmentalized and can't believe they're part of a huge eugenics operation.
[01:45:23.231 --> 01:45:24.991]  I would go a step further.
[01:45:24.991 --> 01:45:27.772]  I would say that they're absolutely mind-controlled.
[01:45:27.772 --> 01:45:29.452]  They're ensuring in candidates.
[01:45:29.452 --> 01:45:33.073]  They're inducing the destruction, decimation of the population.
[01:45:34.102 --> 01:45:39.724]  Because they go through medical education, which is a hazing process.
[01:45:39.724 --> 01:45:40.844]  I went through it.
[01:45:40.844 --> 01:45:53.707]  I'll tell you, it is trauma-based education, where fear and stress to the max, and ultimately what you have are all the elements of cult indoctrination.
[01:45:53.707 --> 01:46:03.270]  Just like the military, 18-hour days being yelled at, having nurses bossing you around, exactly, and then you're so happy to get that degree, and now you get to peck on people.
[01:46:04.113 --> 01:46:13.276]  Right, and then continuing medical education, all bought and paid for by the drug industrialists, and then what you do is like they're showing you.
[01:46:13.276 --> 01:46:15.957]  This was in the news a couple weeks ago.
[01:46:15.957 --> 01:46:24.680]  The advertisers on television are getting the patients to come into the doctors' offices to demand the drugs.
[01:46:24.680 --> 01:46:26.941]  And so this is all about a drug cult.
[01:46:28.641 --> 01:46:32.664]  Well, I'll see ads about, hey, want to be able to play golf for eight hours and not urinate?
[01:46:32.664 --> 01:46:33.324]  Take this.
[01:46:33.324 --> 01:46:38.727]  It causes heart attacks, brain tumors, death, dizziness, teeth fall out, bleeding.
[01:46:38.727 --> 01:46:41.029]  Or, hey, you got restless legs?
[01:46:41.029 --> 01:46:42.210]  Don't go for a walk.
[01:46:42.210 --> 01:46:42.770]  Take this.
[01:46:42.770 --> 01:46:46.953]  It'll make you a psychopathic killer and a compulsive gambler and a sex maniac.
[01:46:46.953 --> 01:46:48.674]  I mean, it's a joke!
[01:46:48.674 --> 01:46:51.916]  Yeah, it's a sick, a total sick cult.
[01:46:52.777 --> 01:46:54.619]  And more people are waking up to it.
[01:46:54.619 --> 01:47:06.589]  My point is that 83% of the people that watched the segment on CNN with Larry King wrote in and said now they believe that the government has been covering up about the risks of vaccinations.
[01:47:07.441 --> 01:47:07.981]  Amazing.
[01:47:07.981 --> 01:47:11.503]  Now, your mother, you believe, died from a vaccination.
[01:47:11.503 --> 01:47:13.824]  I know some people that have died from it.
[01:47:13.824 --> 01:47:15.404]  But shifting gears, Crohn's disease.
[01:47:15.404 --> 01:47:25.248]  I've seen all these studies, government-admitted studies, and you were a trailblazer on this, that they find the measles injection, the smallpox injection, a whole host of shots.
[01:47:25.248 --> 01:47:32.151]  They find the viruses in the gut that are from the vaccine.
[01:47:32.151 --> 01:47:34.592]  And now Crohn's disease that was unknown 50 years ago.
[01:47:34.592 --> 01:47:36.913]  I got somebody in my office
[01:47:37.623 --> 01:47:43.064]  Who almost died, and almost died a few years ago from this.
[01:47:43.064 --> 01:47:46.725]  It's really important to tell people how this happens.
[01:47:46.725 --> 01:47:52.646]  Here's exactly what's taking place with Crohn's disease and all of the autoimmune diseases.
[01:47:52.646 --> 01:48:01.548]  When you get injected with foreign proteins from bacteria, viruses, fungus, yeast, chicken embryo, bovine fetal serum, monkey kidney tissues, etc.
[01:48:02.719 --> 01:48:07.363]  Those proteins, non-human, land on your own human proteins.
[01:48:07.363 --> 01:48:07.864]  Let me stop you!
[01:48:07.864 --> 01:48:10.966]  Also, they admit that they're full of other viruses from the growing of it.
[01:48:10.966 --> 01:48:12.007]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:48:12.007 --> 01:48:16.011]  Yeah, so when you get injected, and your children get injected with this,
[01:48:16.736 --> 01:48:26.839]  Those proteins land on your own human proteins and it forms what's called, in science and medicine, an antigenic complex.
[01:48:26.839 --> 01:48:34.622]  That your white blood cell bodyguards recognize the entire complex, including your own proteins, as foreign.
[01:48:34.622 --> 01:48:37.603]  And it begins to attack and destroy you.
[01:48:37.603 --> 01:48:38.983]  It's just like the germs.
[01:48:38.983 --> 01:48:40.784]  It's just like poison ivy.
[01:48:41.265 --> 01:48:48.240]  Poison ivy, the juice from the plant, or poison oak, or sumac, your body then sees it and attacks itself.
[01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:49.944]  That's basically what's happening with Crohn's, sir.
[01:48:50.703 --> 01:48:52.765]  Yes, all of the autoimmune diseases.
[01:48:52.765 --> 01:48:56.507]  Here's the short list of the new plagues brought on by the vaccines.
[01:48:56.507 --> 01:49:14.581]  Chronic fatigue immune dysfunction, fibromyalgia, lupus, MS, ALS and Lou Gehrig's disease, chronic crippling rheumatoid arthritis, adult and juvenile type 1 diabetes, as you mentioned Crohn's disease, Guillain-Barre that my mother died from, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, Bell's palsy, and many others.
[01:49:16.628 --> 01:49:20.391]  And then meanwhile, the Rockefellers who own all the major oil companies in the U.S.
[01:49:20.391 --> 01:49:29.358]  and basically the banks and everything else, the Federal Reserve, they are strategically large owners of hospital and cancer research divisions, making money.
[01:49:29.358 --> 01:49:34.181]  You work your whole life, they kill you with a bioweapon, then they suck all your money out of you at the end.
[01:49:34.181 --> 01:49:40.286]  Yeah, and they've got an army of medical deities that have no clue about the science about which we speak.
[01:49:43.624 --> 01:49:50.146]  And I guess when all of us have cancer, they'll just have SWAT teams running around machine gunning us and we argue while the cops are dying.
[01:49:50.146 --> 01:49:51.367]  I just can't understand it.
[01:49:51.367 --> 01:49:52.667]  I just can't understand it.
[01:49:52.667 --> 01:50:00.950]  Well, you know, the other thing is kind of like I have a spiritual take on all of this and I look at this whole thing as an evolution, you know, good versus evil.
[01:50:00.950 --> 01:50:05.372]  How far will evil go to undermine good and God?
[01:50:06.926 --> 01:50:10.708]  I just can't believe that police and FBI and others see you and I as the enemy.
[01:50:10.708 --> 01:50:12.969]  You've been visited by the FBI before.
[01:50:12.969 --> 01:50:19.592]  I've had the Secret Service visit me, threats, everything else, all because we have their public documents how they're killing us.
[01:50:19.592 --> 01:50:20.272]  We want them to stop.
[01:50:21.283 --> 01:50:26.865]  Well, that was, you know, the tragedy after the anthrax mailings when the FBI... Now, stay there, stay there.
[01:50:26.865 --> 01:50:29.706]  Yeah, you pointed out it was the government, so they came after you.
[01:50:29.706 --> 01:50:30.246]  Stay there.
[01:50:30.246 --> 01:50:32.467]  Dr. Len Horowitz, amazing guest.
[01:50:32.467 --> 01:50:35.128]  So many websites, so many books, so many videos.
[01:50:35.128 --> 01:50:36.529]  In Lies We Trust, the new video.
[01:50:36.529 --> 01:50:38.189]  Buy the DVD from him.
[01:50:38.189 --> 01:50:41.350]  You know, just like my films are free on the web, if you can afford it, buy the DVD.
[01:50:41.350 --> 01:50:42.731]  It's high quality.
[01:50:42.731 --> 01:50:43.931]  Make copies from that.
[01:50:43.931 --> 01:50:45.372]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:50:45.372 --> 01:50:45.812]  Stay with us.
[01:50:51.064 --> 01:51:04.213]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[01:51:04.213 --> 01:51:15.281]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[01:51:15.281 --> 01:51:18.203]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[01:51:18.703 --> 01:51:20.444]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[01:51:20.444 --> 01:51:26.567]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.
[01:51:26.567 --> 01:51:31.990]  Secure your copy of Loose Change Final Cut today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:51:31.990 --> 01:51:41.776]  While you're visiting the online video store, be sure to check out the huge discounts on films like Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, America, Freedom to Fascism, and hundreds of other titles.
[01:51:42.216 --> 01:51:44.842]  We're in a no-holds-barred information war.
[01:51:44.842 --> 01:51:50.174]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[01:51:51.001 --> 01:51:54.782]  Hi, this is Alex Jones, and I want to talk to you about the high price of gasoline.
[01:51:54.782 --> 01:51:59.503]  It's no secret that gasoline quality is poor, even though we're paying record prices at the pump.
[01:51:59.503 --> 01:52:04.785]  I have run across a company called SFR, who has developed two products that improve gas mileage.
[01:52:04.785 --> 01:52:16.008]  Instead of paying a mechanic as much as $300 to clean your injection system, Protecta Complete Fuel System Treatment cleans to 95% of new engine condition, improving mileage in only one tank full.
[01:52:16.008 --> 01:52:18.369]  Protecta Engine Treatment not only reduces friction,
[01:52:18.789 --> 01:52:20.829]  But it extends the life of your engine.
[01:52:20.829 --> 01:52:21.730]  Let's face it.
[01:52:21.730 --> 01:52:24.570]  With the high price of gasoline, it's time to take action.
[01:52:24.570 --> 01:52:32.591]  Purchase a protective fuel system treatment for only $9.95 and receive a free engine treatment which is a $12.95 value free.
[01:52:32.591 --> 01:52:34.872]  Call 888-USE-SFR1.
[01:52:34.872 --> 01:52:42.073]  That number again is 888-USE-SFR1 or check them out online at oilcompanysecret.com.
[01:52:42.073 --> 01:52:44.234]  That's oilcompanysecret.com.

[01:54:02.117 --> 01:54:06.981]  Is it getting better?
[01:54:06.981 --> 01:54:09.283]  Or do you feel the same?
[01:54:09.283 --> 01:54:12.165]  Even mainstream television admits now it was super U.S.
[01:54:12.165 --> 01:54:15.727]  government, ultra-bioweapons grade, U.S.
[01:54:15.727 --> 01:54:22.652]  patented, coated in bentonite at the microscopic level, miniaturized super spores.
[01:54:22.652 --> 01:54:24.013]  British can't even make it that good.
[01:54:24.013 --> 01:54:25.174]  Israelis can't make it that good.
[01:54:25.174 --> 01:54:26.335]  Russians can't make it that good.
[01:54:28.945 --> 01:54:42.933]  There was even a congressional funding of how to mail anthrax to the mail, and then all the Bush's enemies, including the head editor who sent PIs out with cameras to follow the Bush daughters and caught them falling down drunk, he got mailed the first letter and died.
[01:54:42.933 --> 01:54:47.576]  Super bio-weapon, super weaponized grade.
[01:54:47.576 --> 01:54:55.560]  And then his enemies in Congress get it, and Dr. Horowitz comes out and exposes that, so the FBI comes to his house.
[01:54:55.560 --> 01:54:56.441]  Tell us about that, Doc.
[01:54:57.634 --> 01:54:58.655]  Yeah, that's exactly right.
[01:54:58.655 --> 01:55:02.857]  I went to the FBI one week before the first mailing was announced in the press.
[01:55:02.857 --> 01:55:04.298]  I said, you guys better get on the stick.
[01:55:04.298 --> 01:55:17.945]  You've got a major anthrax scam unfolding at Bayer Corporation, which literally is connected to BASF and Hoax and the people that created IG Farben way back in Hitler's time.
[01:55:18.605 --> 01:55:24.774]  They were at the center of this anthrax mailing investigation.
[01:55:24.774 --> 01:55:29.580]  And I went to the FBI and I said, you guys better get on a stick.
[01:55:29.580 --> 01:55:33.044]  And they never listened to me until about six months later.
[01:55:33.044 --> 01:55:35.428]  They came back to me in the spring.
[01:55:35.888 --> 01:55:41.990]  This is long after, you know, it was September 28, 2001, when I went to see them.
[01:55:41.990 --> 01:55:52.232]  The first press report was October 8th or thereabout, and they finally came to me in the spring and said, we think that you're a suspect.
[01:55:52.232 --> 01:55:54.633]  We want to interrogate you as a suspect.
[01:55:55.350 --> 01:56:08.479]  And so they spent two days interrogating me at my place in Idaho, after which point I kept trying to, you know, naively think that they were going to really begin to look at the multinational corporation.
[01:56:08.479 --> 01:56:09.940]  No, they were there to protect Bayer.
[01:56:09.940 --> 01:56:11.602]  Again, Bayer's been convicted.
[01:56:11.602 --> 01:56:12.522]  It's admitted.
[01:56:12.522 --> 01:56:18.887]  For a decade, they knowingly shipped out millions of ampules of Factor VIII that had HIV and hepatitis in every shot.
[01:56:18.887 --> 01:56:20.048]  And the documents came out.
[01:56:20.048 --> 01:56:21.549]  MSNBC News reported it.
[01:56:21.549 --> 01:56:23.230]  Papantonio won the suit.
[01:56:23.889 --> 01:56:29.450]  And they said, it was their internal documents saying, we know it has HIV, ship it out.
[01:56:29.450 --> 01:56:31.951]  But it isn't that they didn't care, they do care.
[01:56:31.951 --> 01:56:33.892]  They want to kill you.
[01:56:33.892 --> 01:56:36.852]  Bayer was the top Nazi company, Dr. Horowitz, as you know.
[01:56:36.852 --> 01:56:38.593]  That's exactly right.
[01:56:38.593 --> 01:56:41.654]  Extremely good point, eloquently stated.
[01:56:41.654 --> 01:56:45.495]  The reality is that Bayer is heavily implicated in genocide.
[01:56:45.495 --> 01:56:50.456]  And so I went, knowing that I saw this whole thing unfolding on the mainstream media.
[01:56:50.996 --> 01:56:59.242]  You had Peter Jennings on ABC News come out and say, the Wednesday before, tomorrow we're going to cover anthrax.
[01:56:59.242 --> 01:57:03.424]  We're going through your fears one by one, day by day.
[01:57:03.424 --> 01:57:04.445]  Good night.
[01:57:04.445 --> 01:57:06.927]  That was two weeks after September 11th.
[01:57:06.927 --> 01:57:08.728]  I said, man, oh man, I've got to watch this.
[01:57:08.728 --> 01:57:13.531]  And having basically researched for three years anthrax, I saw the scam unfolding.
[01:57:14.071 --> 01:57:29.818]  So, rather than track what I was saying to the people that caused this, and they created this particular strain at the Battelle Memorial Institute, West Jefferson, Ohio, the CIA's project was called Clear Vision.
[01:57:29.818 --> 01:57:32.859]  Pentagon officials called it Project Jefferson.
[01:57:32.859 --> 01:57:42.083]  It was the development of these, exactly as you say, a never-before-seen, hyper-concentrated, electromagnetized, silica-based
[01:57:42.723 --> 01:57:43.344]  I think so.
[01:58:07.392 --> 01:58:09.854]  Dr. Horowitz, I know you've got to jump, but we've got a one-minute break.
[01:58:09.854 --> 01:58:12.175]  I want to come back and finish up for three minutes on the other side.
[01:58:12.175 --> 01:58:13.356]  Do you have the time?
[01:58:13.356 --> 01:58:13.656]  Sure.
[01:58:13.656 --> 01:58:14.577]  Okay, stay there.
[01:58:14.577 --> 01:58:19.360]  Then we've got Richard C. Cook, former government analyst, real expert on the economy.
[01:58:19.360 --> 01:58:22.922]  In a two-hour interview, he's going to break down exactly what we're facing financially.
[01:58:22.922 --> 01:58:25.844]  I've got to have Dr. Horowitz up in the near future for a full two hours.
[01:58:25.844 --> 01:58:27.325]  I really appreciate him coming on with us.
[01:58:27.325 --> 01:58:27.926]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:32.537 --> 01:58:35.159]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:35.159 --> 01:58:38.442]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:38.442 --> 01:58:42.685]  It is a big idea.
[01:58:42.685 --> 01:58:45.508]  A new world order.
[01:58:45.508 --> 01:58:50.171]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:58:50.171 --> 01:58:53.294]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:58:53.294 --> 01:58:55.396]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:58:56.035 --> 01:58:59.196]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:58:59.196 --> 01:59:06.520]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:59:09.554 --> 01:59:14.999]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:59:14.999 --> 01:59:18.883]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:59:18.883 --> 01:59:21.446]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:59:21.446 --> 01:59:22.587]  Most people have no idea.
[01:59:22.587 --> 01:59:23.388]  They're not after money.
[01:59:23.388 --> 01:59:24.649]  They have all the money they need.
[01:59:24.649 --> 01:59:25.650]  They're after power.
[01:59:25.650 --> 01:59:26.791]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[01:59:35.500 --> 01:59:36.261]  Endgame.
[01:59:36.261 --> 01:59:38.303]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:59:38.303 --> 01:59:43.509]  You have been warned.
[01:59:43.509 --> 01:59:45.912]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:45.912 --> 01:59:48.674]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:59:55.228 --> 01:59:56.969]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:56.969 --> 01:59:58.569]  You want answers?
[01:59:58.569 --> 01:59:59.470]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:59.470 --> 02:00:04.312]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:04.312 --> 02:00:10.334]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:10.334 --> 02:00:13.256]  Dr. Horowitz, I want to do part two of this interview in the near future.
[02:00:13.256 --> 02:00:18.398]  I want to fire out some of your websites and, of course, some of your books covering this.
[02:00:18.398 --> 02:00:22.540]  I want listeners to get them and then go track down your sources and find out it's true for yourself.
[02:00:22.540 --> 02:00:23.380]  I want you to know
[02:00:24.204 --> 02:00:26.886]  Especially FBI and government people.
[02:00:26.886 --> 02:00:31.610]  So when your wife or son or daughter or you are dying prematurely, you'll know who did it to you, okay?
[02:00:31.610 --> 02:00:32.231]  It's very important.
[02:00:32.231 --> 02:00:36.214]  I know you're not going to listen until you're dying, but at least then you can tell your family.
[02:00:36.214 --> 02:00:38.135]  Maybe they'll wake up and the death can stop then.
[02:00:38.135 --> 02:00:40.938]  I mean, we're not joking around here.
[02:00:40.938 --> 02:00:41.959]  These people are cold-blooded.
[02:00:41.959 --> 02:00:43.380]  They're in control because they're ruthless.
[02:00:43.380 --> 02:00:44.621]  They want power.
[02:00:44.621 --> 02:00:45.782]  They crave it.
[02:00:45.782 --> 02:00:47.043]  Average folks don't.
[02:00:47.043 --> 02:00:51.046]  Dr. Horowitz, in closing, I remember you telling me years ago, and it was in the news when this happened,
[02:00:51.918 --> 02:00:56.080]  Uh, you know, and you remember you on the air on this show right after 9-11 saying, look for anthrax.
[02:00:56.080 --> 02:01:02.902]  I was saying the same thing as they were hyping and we saw the pre-hyping, but in closing, you know, when you're telling them, don't you care about your family?
[02:01:02.902 --> 02:01:04.723]  Don't you see this?
[02:01:04.723 --> 02:01:13.126]  I mean, these agents at your house for two days, you know, they finally left, but I mean, did you get through to any other humanity or do they like being injected with cancer?
[02:01:13.126 --> 02:01:15.247]  Do they like the fact that they're being murdered?
[02:01:15.247 --> 02:01:18.228]  Do they like the, I mean, I mean, or is it just about the power trip?
[02:01:18.228 --> 02:01:19.809]  They just don't care even if they're being murdered.
[02:01:20.558 --> 02:01:23.762]  No, I think that the FBI agents were extremely impressed.
[02:01:23.762 --> 02:01:28.308]  They went back, they probably told their bosses, you know, leave Horowitz alone.
[02:01:28.308 --> 02:01:30.470]  But I think that's typical.
[02:01:30.470 --> 02:01:32.312]  Most human beings go into
[02:01:33.417 --> 02:01:35.118]  Absolutely amazing.
[02:01:35.118 --> 02:01:37.620]  So it's much worse than what Reverend Jeremiah Wright is saying.
[02:01:37.620 --> 02:01:39.481]  I mean, what he was saying was a shadow of the true monster.
[02:02:03.929 --> 02:02:06.152]  You know, he knows the whole truth.
[02:02:06.152 --> 02:02:11.098]  I watched him and I listened to him now for the first time extensively.
[02:02:11.098 --> 02:02:14.421]  And this man knows what's going on.
[02:02:14.421 --> 02:02:20.048]  Notice when he refers to the media, he calls it the corporate controlled media.
[02:02:20.048 --> 02:02:22.090]  You know, this whole thing is corporate fascism.
[02:02:22.090 --> 02:02:23.352]  That's what globalism is.
[02:02:24.210 --> 02:02:28.974]  And it's not about loving human beings who have ethics and morals and values.
[02:02:28.974 --> 02:02:32.558]  And that's the tragedy, is that we were raised by those people.
[02:02:32.558 --> 02:02:34.439]  If they win, I agree.
[02:02:34.439 --> 02:02:36.361]  If they win, what's the time frame?
[02:02:36.361 --> 02:02:37.462]  How many of us are going to be dead?
[02:02:39.072 --> 02:02:41.715]  I think that they're winning, clearly, in their agenda.
[02:02:41.715 --> 02:02:56.669]  I think they ultimately lose, and we're actually promoting the Love Code Musical Healing Celebration to show you exactly how we win, how spiritual warfare is being conducted, and the tools and the technologies we need to advance triumphantly.
[02:02:57.364 --> 02:03:06.631]  Yay, though we walk through this valley of the shadow of insanity and death, we can fear no evil because ultimately we have the divine technology for protection.
[02:03:06.631 --> 02:03:09.493]  Check out LoveCodeSeminars.com.
[02:03:09.493 --> 02:03:12.976]  LoveCode, C-O-D-E, Seminar.com.
[02:03:12.976 --> 02:03:20.982]  We will check it out, Doc, but I mean, bottom line, politically, what do you see their time frame until they're really just flying over cities, just flat out killing us?
[02:03:20.982 --> 02:03:25.866]  Or will it just be more soft kills and the media explaining why everybody's dying, how it's no big deal?
[02:03:26.366 --> 02:03:28.327]  You know, they're doing it now, Alex.
[02:03:28.327 --> 02:03:29.568]  They're flying over cities.
[02:03:29.568 --> 02:03:30.608]  They're poisoning us.
[02:03:30.608 --> 02:03:32.309]  People are hacking and coughing.
[02:03:32.309 --> 02:03:33.310]  This is the springtime.
[02:03:33.310 --> 02:03:36.031]  We're supposed to have the cleanest atmosphere of the entire year.
[02:03:36.031 --> 02:03:45.796]  Wait till you see this summer where they're going to be telling people everywhere across North America, stay indoors because you can't go out and even breathe the air.
[02:03:45.796 --> 02:03:47.196]  Believe me, you don't have to tell me about it.
[02:03:47.196 --> 02:03:52.419]  I've always been completely healthy and like, a few months ago, everybody I knew was sick and you'd walk outside and go,
[02:03:54.176 --> 02:03:58.047]  And the news would say it was allergies while there were jets flying over and helicopters.
[02:03:58.047 --> 02:03:59.310]  One night I got home at 2 a.m.
[02:03:59.310 --> 02:04:01.456]  and a Cessna flew over with a sprayer going...
[02:04:02.438 --> 02:04:04.079]  Spraying my neighborhood?
[02:04:04.079 --> 02:04:11.382]  Yeah, I just flew from Toronto to Chicago to Spokane, Washington across the United States, and it was hideous.
[02:04:11.382 --> 02:04:27.289]  The atmosphere is completely gray and dirty brown everywhere, and this is what we get by trusting our politicians that are literally whores and prostitutes for the petrochemical pharmaceutical cartel.
[02:04:27.289 --> 02:04:28.650]  Doc, we'll talk to you again soon.
[02:04:28.650 --> 02:04:30.011]  Thank you for all the time.
[02:04:30.011 --> 02:04:30.651]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[02:04:31.451 --> 02:04:31.892]  Amazing.
[02:04:31.892 --> 02:04:32.793]  Dr. Lynn Horowitz.
[02:04:32.793 --> 02:04:38.761]  We've got Richard C. Cook coming up for an hour and 15 minute transmission to break down what's really happening with the economy.
[02:04:38.761 --> 02:04:40.463]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[02:04:40.463 --> 02:04:41.825]  Standby for more transmission.
[02:04:47.762 --> 02:04:49.723]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[02:04:49.723 --> 02:04:53.345]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:04:53.345 --> 02:04:55.807]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:04:55.807 --> 02:04:58.829]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:04:58.829 --> 02:05:04.572]  It is essential that Patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[02:05:04.572 --> 02:05:08.475]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[02:07:48.962 --> 02:07:55.604]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:07:55.604 --> 02:07:58.585]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:11.806 --> 02:08:22.271]  In just a moment, we're going to be speaking to Richard C. Cook, prolific author, former federal government analyst, one of the key figures behind the investigation of Space Shuttle Challenger.
[02:08:22.271 --> 02:08:25.212]  He's well known for his financial analysis.
[02:08:25.212 --> 02:08:36.537]  And I've had the head of the New York Business School on, and Dr. Paul Kirk Roberts, and Joseph Stiglitz, Nobel Prize winner, was back with us last week, and Bob Chapman, and they basically all concur with what our guest is about to say.
[02:08:36.537 --> 02:08:38.318]  It's the same basic analysis, but he
[02:08:39.111 --> 02:08:42.634]  Really flushes it out nicely and covers a lot of facets we haven't gotten into.
[02:08:42.634 --> 02:08:52.221]  So I want to cover what the current crisis is, where he thinks it's going, getting different perspectives, because they all vary a bit, even with dead reckoning.
[02:08:52.221 --> 02:08:58.607]  We're all seeing the same data and then going back, understanding how we got here and where it's going.
[02:08:58.607 --> 02:09:01.669]  Because to know where we're going, we got to know where we come from.
[02:09:01.669 --> 02:09:05.452]  Now, before we go to our guest, I just want to plug a couple sponsors.
[02:09:06.254 --> 02:09:19.785]  But I want you to remember that not only are these great sponsors, because I only plug things I believe in, unlike some people, and things I try, things I've used, but that it also, then, also supports this radio show.
[02:09:19.785 --> 02:09:25.569]  And one of those is eFoods Direct, the longest continually operating storable foods company in the nation.
[02:09:25.569 --> 02:09:32.835]  With all of the uncertainty that's going on, you need a storable food from a company that's inexpensive, a good value, and that you can trust.
[02:09:32.835 --> 02:09:35.377]  It's high quality, clean, non-GMO food.
[02:09:36.357 --> 02:09:37.138]  Right here in the U.S.
[02:09:37.138 --> 02:09:48.507]  of A. Whether it's economic calamity or food shortages, regardless, it's an insurance policy you can eat, and I suggest you give them a call, get a free brochure, or get a year's supply of food.
[02:09:48.507 --> 02:09:51.350]  It's very inexpensive, you'll be surprised.
[02:09:51.350 --> 02:09:51.850]  1-800-409-5633.
[02:09:51.850 --> 02:09:51.930]  1-800-409-5633.
[02:09:51.930 --> 02:09:55.253]  Now, the government stockpiles food and says we're going to have all this bedlam and they're fear-mongering.
[02:10:01.596 --> 02:10:03.277]  And there are shortages all over the world.
[02:10:03.277 --> 02:10:06.760]  I've been plugging this for a year before all this was happening.
[02:10:06.760 --> 02:10:18.268]  I'm just saying I think it's a good insurance policy with all the uncertainty we have because in the Great Depression, we had 80 plus percent of people living on the farms and self-sufficient.
[02:10:18.268 --> 02:10:23.772]  Now we have 10 percent in the country with half of those, 5 percent total, that are somewhat self-sufficient.
[02:10:23.772 --> 02:10:25.954]  So, folks, you got to eat.
[02:10:25.954 --> 02:10:26.074]  1-800-409-5633.
[02:10:26.074 --> 02:10:28.656]  And if there's a 10 percent chance we're going to have a depression,
[02:10:31.052 --> 02:10:34.774]  It's more like 50% chance or higher that it's going to be really bad, then you need the food.
[02:10:34.774 --> 02:10:35.755]  That's my reason.
[02:10:35.755 --> 02:10:40.158]  Not food shortage, freakouts, and the rest of it.
[02:10:40.158 --> 02:10:43.120]  I just think it's being overhyped, but you know, c'est la vie.
[02:10:43.120 --> 02:10:44.521]  There's no excuse not to get the food.
[02:10:44.521 --> 02:10:45.501]  Okay, now I've belabored that.
[02:10:45.501 --> 02:10:48.403]  It's a one-minute plug, but I really believe in it, so I go overboard.
[02:10:48.403 --> 02:10:51.745]  Also, aloes from the folks at New Vitality.
[02:10:51.745 --> 02:10:55.608]  This is one of the big respected vitamin companies, mineral supplement companies.
[02:10:57.025 --> 02:10:58.546]  We're proud to have them as sponsors.
[02:10:58.546 --> 02:11:01.907]  Big banners up on Infowars.com and PrismPlanet.com.
[02:11:01.907 --> 02:11:04.869]  They have a lot of great products, hundreds of great products.
[02:11:04.869 --> 02:11:13.813]  And they just have things like concentrated aloe vera tablets that are very well known to detoxify your guts, your intestines, your stomach, and to strip it all out.
[02:11:13.813 --> 02:11:14.833]  Just really good stuff.
[02:11:14.833 --> 02:11:15.974]  Aloe-ease, colon cleanse.
[02:11:17.425 --> 02:11:24.490]  Uh, 1-800-569-4056, 1-800-569-4056, or newvitality.com.
[02:11:24.490 --> 02:11:29.393]  And then, of course, there's also Inner Food, the best green food I've found out there, and their Patriots.
[02:11:29.393 --> 02:11:30.434]  They hate the New World Order.
[02:11:30.434 --> 02:11:32.656]  Uh, I take it every day.
[02:11:32.656 --> 02:11:34.297]  Most of my office takes it.
[02:11:34.297 --> 02:11:39.240]  When they run out, they go down to Brave New Books in Austin and buy more, but, uh, if you're in Austin, you can get it there.
[02:11:39.240 --> 02:11:42.503]  But they're just fabulous folks, and it's got 20 superfoods in it.
[02:11:42.503 --> 02:11:45.625]  Dulse Kelp, Barley Grass, Wheat Grass, Queralina, Spirulina.
[02:11:46.095 --> 02:11:49.396]  Cherry root, just so much more.
[02:11:49.396 --> 02:11:57.540]  1-866-762-9238 or interfood.com.
[02:11:57.540 --> 02:12:08.705]  Go to infowars.com, link through on the link there on the side and get 10% off because you're an Alex Jones website reader or you can call them and tell them you're a listener and you get 10% off.
[02:12:08.705 --> 02:12:09.565]  1-866-762-9238 or interfood.com.
[02:12:14.500 --> 02:12:20.522]  In financial news, Warren Buffett is saying the recession could be worse than they first feared.
[02:12:20.522 --> 02:12:23.903]  See, we've been in a recession for years.
[02:12:23.903 --> 02:12:29.244]  Incomes went down thousands of dollars in the last six years.
[02:12:29.244 --> 02:12:33.605]  They cooked the numbers, the CPI, the rest of it.
[02:12:33.605 --> 02:12:36.206]  And now they're telling you, okay, maybe the recession is going to be worse.
[02:12:36.206 --> 02:12:40.467]  When you add in all the different factors, it's stormy weather.
[02:12:40.467 --> 02:12:41.408]  The worse we've seen in
[02:12:44.670 --> 02:12:46.171]  60-70 years, any way you cut it.
[02:12:46.171 --> 02:12:55.676]  I don't know how bad that typhoon's gonna be, but it's five miles off, we're already in high winds, we're battening down the sails and the hatches, and it's serious.
[02:12:55.676 --> 02:12:57.937]  And so they're easing you in while they hand out
[02:12:58.607 --> 02:13:12.993]  Carbine .308 rifles to the major police departments as they double the SWAT teams in every major city, as they openly say they're getting ready for martial law and deploy microwave guns and sound cannons to every major city and build FEMA camps.
[02:13:12.993 --> 02:13:15.274]  I mean, they're getting ready for something.
[02:13:15.274 --> 02:13:18.215]  Massive saber-rattling with Iran.
[02:13:18.215 --> 02:13:22.156]  Just crazy talk from neocons.
[02:13:22.156 --> 02:13:25.918]  Wolfowitz is running around saying that
[02:13:27.318 --> 02:13:32.803]  Paul Wolfowitz said yesterday that there has been no insurrection and no occupation since 2004.
[02:13:32.803 --> 02:13:35.326]  He said, yeah, the war is over.
[02:13:35.326 --> 02:13:52.042]  I mean, we've now entered a double-think land where, I mean, I expect Bush with the behavioral psychologists just to flip us out, because this is all being done scientifically, to come out dressed up in Teletubby outfits or something and, you know, smoke
[02:13:52.760 --> 02:13:53.981]  LSD on television.
[02:13:53.981 --> 02:14:03.545]  I mean, it's gotten so crazy that, and I've read their behavioral psychology documents from 20 years ago, the last things declassified, they're doing this on purpose.
[02:14:03.545 --> 02:14:15.730]  You know, when they kill Al Zahari four times and Zarqawi 14 times and the Saddam sons four times and then have the Intel Center upload Al Qaeda videos in the same video layer as the Intel Center bug.
[02:14:15.730 --> 02:14:18.431]  I mean, it's all just, just, just in your face.
[02:14:18.431 --> 02:14:19.892]  All right, I'm already digressing and ranting.
[02:14:19.892 --> 02:14:20.832]  I'm sorry.
[02:14:20.832 --> 02:14:22.133]  Let's go to our guest for the next hour and
[02:14:23.172 --> 02:14:24.373]  47 minutes.
[02:14:24.373 --> 02:14:26.215]  Richard C. Cook.
[02:14:26.215 --> 02:14:27.496]  He's got Richard Cook.
[02:14:27.496 --> 02:14:28.497]  Richard C. Cook.
[02:14:28.497 --> 02:14:31.259]  So it's Richard C. Cook dot com.
[02:14:31.259 --> 02:14:35.023]  Links up on Infowars dot com.
[02:14:35.023 --> 02:14:36.384]  And he worked at NASA.
[02:14:36.384 --> 02:14:37.044]  He worked in the U.S.
[02:14:37.044 --> 02:14:38.546]  Civil Service Commission.
[02:14:38.546 --> 02:14:43.790]  He worked in the Jimmy Carter White House under... It just goes on and on in his bio.
[02:14:43.790 --> 02:14:46.112]  You can just go to his website and read it.
[02:14:46.112 --> 02:14:49.075]  Graduated honors from the College of William & Mary where he was
[02:14:49.710 --> 02:14:51.351]  Elected to Phi Beta Kappa.
[02:14:51.351 --> 02:14:53.672]  He resides in College Park, Maryland.
[02:14:53.672 --> 02:14:54.893]  On and on and on.
[02:14:54.893 --> 02:14:56.874]  And we appreciate you coming on, Mr. Cook.
[02:14:56.874 --> 02:14:58.254]  Yeah, thank you very much, Alex.
[02:14:58.254 --> 02:14:59.615]  It's really great to be here.
[02:14:59.615 --> 02:15:00.356]  It's great to have you on.
[02:15:00.356 --> 02:15:03.437]  You also write for Global Research, a lot of other publications.
[02:15:03.437 --> 02:15:10.561]  Before we get into the economy, what do you think about Wolfowitz saying that there's really been no war since 2004?
[02:15:10.561 --> 02:15:12.322]  Well, it's absurd, of course.
[02:15:13.879 --> 02:15:25.586]  Right now, the United States has embarked upon, and we have been for the Bush administration in going back even further than that, the military conquest of the Middle East.
[02:15:25.586 --> 02:15:28.148]  Everything that's happened in Iraq is a part of that.
[02:15:28.148 --> 02:15:36.513]  They've lined up Iran for the next phase, and so on it goes.
[02:15:36.513 --> 02:15:42.397]  Well, then in a nutshell, with your analysis, your take on things, projecting the lines,
[02:15:43.075 --> 02:15:45.896]  How do you see the next few years unfolding?
[02:15:45.896 --> 02:15:50.098]  We're in an economic collapse in the United States.
[02:15:50.098 --> 02:15:55.241]  We do not have a producing economy anymore to speak of.
[02:15:55.241 --> 02:16:04.486]  We were once the world's greatest industrial economy coming out of World War II through the 50s on into the 1960s.
[02:16:04.486 --> 02:16:09.348]  All that began to change in the 1970s where we began the transition
[02:16:10.103 --> 02:16:14.704]  From being a producing economy to being a financial economy.
[02:16:14.704 --> 02:16:25.227]  The power of money creation was turned over entirely to the bankers through the Federal Reserve System, through the policies of monetarism.
[02:16:25.227 --> 02:16:26.427]  And surprise, surprise!
[02:16:26.427 --> 02:16:28.628]  It's just been financial bubbles.
[02:16:28.628 --> 02:16:29.508]  And surprise, surprise!
[02:16:29.508 --> 02:16:33.089]  We gave private interest unlimited power and they stole us blind.
[02:16:33.089 --> 02:16:36.670]  And now they know we're going to get mad, so they've militarized the police.
[02:16:36.670 --> 02:16:38.070]  And I want to walk through all that.
[02:16:39.028 --> 02:16:42.271]  But for those that don't know, that's what globalism's about.
[02:16:42.271 --> 02:16:55.081]  It's about bringing down the nation states, getting us all dependent, getting us all off the land, all under their grid for domestication, and so eugenics operations can then be carried out against us at their leisure.
[02:16:57.398 --> 02:17:01.501]  Well, the gross domestic product in this country, if you look at real growth, really has not changed a whole lot.
[02:17:24.262 --> 02:17:46.999]  Since the 1970s, most of the economic growth that has been counted by the government is in the financial sector, to the point where the financial sector has been the driver of the economy, but of course all of that is based upon lending and financial bubbles through successive phases going back all the way into the Reagan years.
[02:17:46.999 --> 02:17:53.224]  All of that is coming to a head because the financial bubbles have gotten so out of control under the Bush administration
[02:17:53.871 --> 02:18:04.917]  But there's really nothing left to inflate except for the fuel inflation and now the food inflation that really is what I call the terminal bubble.
[02:18:04.917 --> 02:18:14.922]  Once you start taking away people's homes through inflating the value, and then you start taking away their food through inflating the cost of food, there's not a whole lot left that you can inflate.
[02:18:14.922 --> 02:18:23.227]  In the meantime, with all of our jobs going overseas, with the manufacturing industries being decimated, with the infrastructure crumbling,
[02:18:23.792 --> 02:18:27.074]  Leaving us only with what's left of the service economy.
[02:18:27.074 --> 02:18:34.619]  There's nothing left for the American people to live on except for the handouts that come down from these financial bubbles.
[02:18:34.619 --> 02:18:40.343]  And they're going to bring out all this fiat currency, 10% of college grads and now Homeland Security related.
[02:18:40.343 --> 02:18:44.546]  They admit we're going to shift over into a literal prison grid.
[02:18:44.546 --> 02:18:50.030]  Well, the inflation has gone about as far as it can go.
[02:18:50.894 --> 02:18:56.882]  And it's about to come down, and we're going into what I call a terminal depression.
[02:18:56.882 --> 02:19:03.250]  And what that's going to lead to is the end of the United States as a producing economy.
[02:19:03.250 --> 02:19:04.391]  And I think it's deliberate.
[02:19:04.391 --> 02:19:07.275]  I think this is something that's been in the works for a very long time.
[02:19:07.984 --> 02:19:11.466]  I think we're seeing those plans coming to fruition now.
[02:19:11.466 --> 02:19:11.886]  I agree.
[02:19:11.886 --> 02:19:12.286]  Stay there.
[02:19:12.286 --> 02:19:13.006]  We're about to break.
[02:19:13.006 --> 02:19:18.049]  Let's come down and talk about what that's going to look like and explain why it is a terminal depression.
[02:19:18.049 --> 02:19:27.293]  And we're going to be a third world country with festooned armies of paramilitary police with felony records that they admit they're recruiting felons now.
[02:19:27.293 --> 02:19:28.894]  Just hell.
[02:19:28.894 --> 02:19:29.994]  Hell is being released.
[02:19:29.994 --> 02:19:33.016]  Richard C. Cook, he of course has written for
[02:19:34.184 --> 02:19:42.687]  The Washington Post, Washington Monthly, Space and Security News, The Houston Post, Press Conferences for the Institute of Space and Security Studies.
[02:19:42.687 --> 02:19:43.988]  This guy knows what he's talking about.
[02:19:43.988 --> 02:19:45.268]  We're honored to have him.
[02:19:45.268 --> 02:19:48.330]  Richard C. Cook dot com.
[02:19:48.330 --> 02:19:49.730]  It is a big idea.
[02:19:49.730 --> 02:19:52.571]  A new world order.
[02:19:52.571 --> 02:19:56.933]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:19:57.435 --> 02:20:00.277]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[02:20:00.277 --> 02:20:03.060]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:20:03.060 --> 02:20:06.242]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:20:06.242 --> 02:20:13.568]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.

[02:20:31.698 --> 02:20:32.699]  They're after power.
[02:20:32.699 --> 02:20:34.000]  That's what they're after these years.

[02:23:59.492 --> 02:24:03.254]  Breaking down, big syndicate of colonists, breaking down where he sees this going.
[02:24:05.310 --> 02:24:13.597]  Let's go over what the collapse will look like, the time frame you think, and then let's talk about what caused it, who stands to gain from it, and go back to the beginning.
[02:24:13.597 --> 02:24:14.438]  Please go ahead.
[02:24:14.438 --> 02:24:20.604]  Okay, let me just mention, if I could Alex, I've got an email that we just brought up.
[02:24:20.604 --> 02:24:30.713]  My partner, Susan Bosk, and I have an email at economicsanity at gmail.com, and if people are interested in sending in questions,
[02:24:31.750 --> 02:24:35.032]  They can send it to that, economicsanityatgmail.com.
[02:24:35.032 --> 02:24:42.155]  And we also talk about my new book that'll be coming out, called We Hold These Truths, The Promise of Monetary Reform.
[02:24:42.155 --> 02:24:45.296]  So that'll be coming out later this year.
[02:24:45.296 --> 02:24:47.297]  It's been published by Tendril Press.
[02:24:47.297 --> 02:24:47.878]  Oh, good!
[02:24:47.878 --> 02:24:52.280]  But I think the thing to understand is that the U.S.
[02:24:52.280 --> 02:24:56.722]  economy today is on the verge of collapse.
[02:24:57.706 --> 02:25:11.316]  And if it does, and I believe that this collapse is foreseen, it is planned, and part of the bursting of all of these bubbles that we see is to bring it about.
[02:25:11.316 --> 02:25:23.264]  And we are going to be facing here a ruined nation with no manufacturing base, an infrastructure that's crumbling, the bridges collapsing, aging population,
[02:25:24.326 --> 02:25:29.588]  Insufficient food because we've allowed our family farming to be ruined.
[02:25:29.588 --> 02:25:31.188]  Poorly developed resources.
[02:25:31.188 --> 02:25:33.229]  We've capped our oil wells.
[02:25:33.229 --> 02:25:35.970]  We've sealed up a lot of our mines.
[02:25:35.970 --> 02:25:38.411]  And the dollar is collapsing.
[02:25:38.411 --> 02:25:45.013]  Now, there's plenty of prophets of doom who say that, well, this is just overpopulation and we're going to have scarcity.
[02:25:45.013 --> 02:25:46.814]  Well, that is not really true.
[02:25:46.814 --> 02:25:47.314]  That's right.
[02:25:47.314 --> 02:25:53.196]  They're engineering it so they can come in with these global managers to leverage the crisis they created.
[02:25:53.954 --> 02:26:04.036]  And I think, too, that these rumors of a North American Union with the currency being changed to the Amero, there's something to that.
[02:26:04.036 --> 02:26:18.440]  And I think that's really where it's headed, where we're going to be folded into the overall global structure of a few centers of very tightly controlled local economies.
[02:26:19.130 --> 02:26:27.829]  But it's been part of the program to take down the United States as a producer, as a powerful world economy for decades.
[02:26:28.622 --> 02:26:30.662]  And this is what's going on right now.
[02:26:30.662 --> 02:26:36.564]  And by the way, rumors of our demise have been greatly exaggerated, but now Mark Twain's going into the ground.
[02:26:36.564 --> 02:26:38.544]  I mean, they're putting dirt on top of the casket.
[02:26:38.544 --> 02:26:50.166]  This was designed, and then you'll have these huge international sentinels of wealth, with private military armies, controlling other conscript armies, just deploying and running their operations.
[02:26:50.166 --> 02:26:53.847]  The middle class was the main enemy, and now they're being laid low.
[02:26:54.403 --> 02:27:02.425]  Well, the real center of all this is in the banking centers of Northern Europe, including London.
[02:27:02.425 --> 02:27:04.726]  That's where it's always been run from.
[02:27:04.726 --> 02:27:07.567]  That's where it's being run from today.
[02:27:07.567 --> 02:27:12.468]  And if you want to go back, we can go well into the last couple hundred years.
[02:27:13.416 --> 02:27:15.357]  To see how all of that came about.
[02:27:15.357 --> 02:27:15.997]  We will.
[02:27:15.997 --> 02:27:18.318]  Why are the elites so viciously doing this, John?
[02:27:18.318 --> 02:27:27.361]  I mean, I guess it's militarily to get everybody leveraged, blow out economies, as the IMF World Bank documents from 2002 state, to then consolidate everything.
[02:27:27.361 --> 02:27:28.761]  Well, the time has come for it.
[02:27:28.761 --> 02:27:30.442]  The time is ripe.
[02:27:30.442 --> 02:27:36.063]  They have the technology, they have the communications, they have the control, and the U.S.
[02:27:36.063 --> 02:27:40.565]  has pretty much played itself out now as being the military enforcer
[02:27:41.397 --> 02:27:41.597]  Of course.
[02:27:57.119 --> 02:27:59.540]  Control of the world for the financial empire.
[02:27:59.540 --> 02:27:59.861]  That's right.
[02:27:59.861 --> 02:28:01.962]  We've been parlayed.
[02:28:01.962 --> 02:28:04.723]  We've given them everything we can and now they're done with us.
[02:28:04.723 --> 02:28:05.123]  That's it.
[02:28:05.123 --> 02:28:06.344]  We've been parlayed.
[02:28:06.344 --> 02:28:12.087]  We're like a pony express horse whose heart has burst and they're jumping on another horse.
[02:28:12.087 --> 02:28:13.108]  Who is that pony?
[02:28:13.108 --> 02:28:13.888]  China?
[02:28:13.888 --> 02:28:15.729]  China.
[02:28:15.729 --> 02:28:16.930]  Yes.
[02:28:16.930 --> 02:28:22.393]  China's being groomed and you can see this in all of this that's going on with the Olympics.
[02:28:22.393 --> 02:28:24.094]  China's going through training now.
[02:28:24.813 --> 02:28:28.034]  Where the financiers have moved in to take over that country.
[02:28:28.034 --> 02:28:31.336]  That's what all the Western investment in China is about.
[02:28:31.336 --> 02:28:41.080]  And China is a very useful tool in this, because they have a totalitarian government that has terrorized their own population to pretty much do what they're told.
[02:28:41.080 --> 02:28:46.583]  There's going to be, they're already the biggest ground army in the world.
[02:28:46.583 --> 02:28:51.085]  And yes, China is going to be the next country that's going to be the enforcer
[02:28:51.955 --> 02:28:57.100]  For the financiers, but again, remember, the center of financial control is Europe.
[02:28:57.100 --> 02:29:05.227]  That's what the European Union is about, and they're going to be putting together their own consolidated nuclear force to protect the financial centers.
[02:29:05.227 --> 02:29:12.974]  But China is going to be the enforcer, and the real enemies of the financiers always have been two nations.
[02:29:12.974 --> 02:29:16.097]  One has been the United States, and the other has been Russia.
[02:29:16.909 --> 02:29:18.290]  Stay there, Richard C. Cook.
[02:29:18.290 --> 02:29:19.611]  Long, long segment.
[02:29:19.611 --> 02:29:21.112]  Plenty of time to go over this.
[02:29:21.112 --> 02:29:22.633]  Powerful info.
[02:29:22.633 --> 02:29:23.693]  Hope everybody's listening.
[02:29:23.693 --> 02:29:24.434]  Call everybody you know.
[02:29:24.434 --> 02:29:25.915]  Tell them to tune in right now.
[02:29:25.915 --> 02:29:27.596]  This is your future.
[02:29:27.596 --> 02:29:30.338]  And they're going to turn the cops loose on us.
[02:29:30.338 --> 02:29:38.102]  Our carcass is going to be climbed over by worms.
[02:29:38.102 --> 02:29:39.503]  We're on the march.
[02:29:39.503 --> 02:29:42.025]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:42.025 --> 02:29:44.727]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:47.984 --> 02:29:51.367]  Someday, cancer, diabetes, and poor health may disrupt your life.
[02:29:51.367 --> 02:29:54.309]  Are you going to be the one in four who gets cancer in their lifetime?

[02:30:05.137 --> 02:30:11.722]  Fast food and unhealthy habits contribute to excess acid and undesirable effects that lay foundations of disease and poor health.
[02:30:11.722 --> 02:30:14.544]  Do you remember the old saying, an apple a day keeps the doctor away?
[02:30:14.744 --> 02:30:16.345]  Those words of wisdom are true.
[02:30:16.345 --> 02:30:24.070]  Your body heals itself when eating well, rather than fighting the effects of chemicals like corn syrup, sugar, preservatives, and other unpronounceable ingredients.
[02:30:24.070 --> 02:30:33.617]  Your body is the best pharmacy in the world, and with AlkaVita, it can help your body naturally neutralize excess body acid, and help hydrate your body, promoting the energized, healthier you.

[02:31:03.215 --> 02:31:03.515]  We're good.
[02:31:22.631 --> 02:31:23.051]  I don't know.
[02:31:49.671 --> 02:31:55.959]  Harness the power of nature's thunderstorm to make your home smell fresh and reduce the threat of MRSA black mold, bird flu and more!
[02:31:57.096 --> 02:32:03.360]  The EPA has stated that indoor air is up to five times more polluted than outdoors, causing 50% of all illnesses.

[02:32:39.220 --> 02:32:40.280]  Eastern for our easy pay plan today.
[02:32:51.879 --> 02:33:04.304]  Did you see how they had those Chinese secret police beating up Londoners, Parisians, San Franciscans?
[02:33:04.304 --> 02:33:07.086]  It was all done on purpose.
[02:33:07.086 --> 02:33:09.867]  This is all official global documents.
[02:33:10.803 --> 02:33:13.524]  China is going to be their new army.
[02:33:13.524 --> 02:33:19.065]  You think you're going to live out in the woods?
[02:33:19.065 --> 02:33:23.166]  What do you think 5 million cops, it's 2 million now, are going to be doing?
[02:33:23.166 --> 02:33:27.086]  Taking your farm, taking your ranch.
[02:33:27.086 --> 02:33:34.908]  They're going to a predatory economy where these yuppies are going to do anything they're told to try to keep their standard of living.
[02:33:38.638 --> 02:33:40.700]  And they're going to come and they're going to take everything you've got.
[02:33:40.700 --> 02:33:45.644]  I've studied countries, economies, when they collapse, especially in this model, and it looks bad.
[02:33:45.644 --> 02:33:56.913]  I want to get former government analyst, advisor to NASA, Washington Post writer, the list goes on and on, Richard C. Cook, richardccook.com, really valuable info.
[02:33:56.913 --> 02:34:02.018]  Continuing with what this collapse will look like, give us, I mean you think it's going to, I mean it's already happening now, but
[02:34:02.598 --> 02:34:09.680]  Most of the economists I have on say two to three years till total hyperinflation, inflationary depression.
[02:34:09.680 --> 02:34:11.741]  You're calling it terminal depression.
[02:34:11.741 --> 02:34:19.023]  I agree because we rebounded from the emergency reorganization by the same bankers in 33.
[02:34:19.023 --> 02:34:21.064]  Just tell me where you think it's going.
[02:34:21.064 --> 02:34:27.986]  Well, I think that they're trying to keep things afloat as best they can until the election this November.
[02:34:29.296 --> 02:34:40.899]  They don't want to rattle the voters too much and cause the voters to do anything radical like elect a Ron Paul or maybe even a more progressive Democrat.
[02:34:40.899 --> 02:34:49.402]  So things are being kept closely under wraps until after the November election and after the inauguration next January.
[02:34:49.402 --> 02:34:57.044]  At that time, I think that the Federal Reserve is going to back off and is going to announce that we're going to let the correction take its course
[02:34:57.950 --> 02:35:14.388]  And at that point I think we'll really go into heavy unemployment and severe shortages of gasoline, severe shortages of food, and that will be the beginning of the end phase of the collapse.
[02:35:14.388 --> 02:35:18.233]  And I just make the base point that I made earlier.
[02:35:19.425 --> 02:35:37.733]  If you have 80-plus percent that were agrarian, living in the rural areas, truly self-sufficient in the 30s during the Depression, and people still starved to death, and they were basically slave colonies and grapes of wrath, now we have 10% in the country, 5% self-sufficient.
[02:35:37.733 --> 02:35:39.494]  My God!
[02:35:39.494 --> 02:35:42.495]  I mean, this is, no wonder they're building giant FEMA camps.
[02:35:42.495 --> 02:35:44.896]  The food supply is being taken away.
[02:35:44.896 --> 02:35:46.737]  We're in, and I've been saying this now,
[02:35:47.395 --> 02:35:50.817]  I may be the only analyst who's been saying this over the last year.
[02:35:50.817 --> 02:35:58.441]  You know, I've written this in some of my articles, and people think I'm a little bit off the wall by warning of famine in the United States.
[02:35:58.441 --> 02:36:01.543]  Well, now the Wall Street Journal agrees with you, but go ahead.
[02:36:01.543 --> 02:36:04.905]  You know, how could it happen here, the richest nation on the Earth?
[02:36:04.905 --> 02:36:06.686]  And what I'm saying is that we are
[02:36:07.443 --> 02:36:13.730]  Maybe one winter away from widespread food shortages and possibly starvation in the United States.
[02:36:13.730 --> 02:36:23.921]  Now there's three or four things that feed into that, but I think one of the main ones is the dollars, like a peso now almost, and so foreign countries are buying more of our production.
[02:36:24.787 --> 02:36:27.288]  And I see the ethanol situation as a red herring.
[02:36:27.288 --> 02:36:31.868]  I'm not saying I defend it, but compared to other things that are happening.
[02:36:31.868 --> 02:36:38.370]  And at the same time, we have had some bad weather, and the globalists have been bidding up the price of food.
[02:36:38.370 --> 02:36:39.630]  Do you have a comment on that?
[02:36:39.630 --> 02:36:45.311]  Well, the food is simply not there the way it has been in the past.
[02:36:45.311 --> 02:36:48.992]  Global food stores and reserves are way down.
[02:36:50.318 --> 02:36:54.780]  Productivity is down because of the genetically manufactured seeds.
[02:36:54.780 --> 02:36:59.561]  People don't realize that you get less yield per acre with that than you do with traditional crops.
[02:36:59.561 --> 02:37:06.423]  But more important than that is the fact that we just do not have family farms anymore.
[02:37:06.423 --> 02:37:13.926]  As you know, and as you've said, Alex, for most of our history, most people in America have been fed from farms that are 10, 15, 20 miles away.
[02:37:16.132 --> 02:37:28.768]  Now, if you're subject to a distribution system where your food is brought in from overseas, not even within the United States in a lot of cases, what happens if transportation systems break down?
[02:37:28.768 --> 02:37:31.512]  What happens if the price of fuel shoots up?
[02:37:31.512 --> 02:37:33.895]  What happens if truckers won't haul it anymore?
[02:37:33.895 --> 02:37:34.436]  You can't eat.
[02:37:34.938 --> 02:37:36.139]  And that's where we are right now.
[02:37:51.753 --> 02:38:00.995]  The big corporations are moving in who will, during this period of gas prices skyrocketing, they are cutting prices and saying they mean to drive everybody out.
[02:38:00.995 --> 02:38:03.355]  And that's just one microcosm everywhere.
[02:38:03.355 --> 02:38:06.196]  It's a hyper-predatory system.
[02:38:06.196 --> 02:38:06.856]  That's correct.
[02:38:06.856 --> 02:38:16.538]  And if the food isn't being grown somewhere where it can get to you, or you can get to it, then what's going to happen when decisions are made at the corporate level
[02:38:17.239 --> 02:38:21.701]  Or at the level of the financial controllers that we're just going to stop hauling it for a while.
[02:38:21.701 --> 02:38:22.602]  You have no choice.
[02:38:22.602 --> 02:38:23.982]  You've got nothing left to eat.
[02:38:23.982 --> 02:38:30.566]  Sir, have you read the 1,000 plus pages or scanned over the IMF World Bank document leaks of 2002?
[02:38:30.566 --> 02:38:37.669]  Because they say in there, it's how they call the IMF riot, how they go in and pay governments off to do this.
[02:38:37.669 --> 02:38:43.472]  Then they even shut off the water and gas for a while to cause riots to fully crater the economy.
[02:38:44.019 --> 02:38:45.340]  Well, I've written about that.
[02:38:45.340 --> 02:38:56.047]  You know, it's been IMF policy for a long time, under what they call the Washington Consensus, to take away the ability of developing countries to produce their own food supply.
[02:38:56.047 --> 02:39:03.792]  There was an article the other day in the Washington Post saying that this African country, Mauritania, only grew 30% of their own food.
[02:39:03.792 --> 02:39:09.356]  Well, how can that be a developing country that is dependent for its food supply 70% on foreign producers?
[02:39:11.027 --> 02:39:14.710]  That's an example of what the IMF has done to the developing world.
[02:39:14.710 --> 02:39:16.631]  This is a great tragedy worldwide.
[02:39:16.631 --> 02:39:24.236]  Well, State Department Random 200 says it's the policy for eugenics to not allow these countries to have their own food supply.
[02:39:24.236 --> 02:39:28.299]  But the strange thing is that it's also being done to the United States right now.
[02:39:28.299 --> 02:39:35.464]  Well, that's what I was saying is that that's the thinking in the last decade was it was time to now treat us as a third world colony.
[02:39:35.464 --> 02:39:36.205]  Yes, that's right.
[02:39:37.316 --> 02:39:39.719]  Well, please continue with what this will look like then.
[02:39:39.719 --> 02:39:43.923]  What are cops going to do when their grandmother, when their mother is starving to death?
[02:39:43.923 --> 02:39:54.533]  I guess they'll do like Mr. Richard did, where the head of the police in the county around New Orleans, his mother called him on a cell phone for five days saying, son, come get me.
[02:39:54.533 --> 02:39:55.294]  I'm in the nursing home.
[02:39:55.294 --> 02:39:58.257]  And he followed orders and he cried on TV and said, I let her die.
[02:39:58.257 --> 02:39:58.938]  I follow orders.
[02:39:59.648 --> 02:40:01.910]  I guess mommy will die, that's what they do, huh?
[02:40:01.910 --> 02:40:03.991]  I think New Orleans is the model, you know?
[02:40:03.991 --> 02:40:11.496]  Half the people who were there before have been able to go back and it's become the Disney World on the Mississippi.
[02:40:11.496 --> 02:40:16.139]  And the rest of the people are just left to fend for themselves as best they can.
[02:40:16.139 --> 02:40:21.323]  And that's certainly where I think things are headed for most of the United States.
[02:40:21.323 --> 02:40:27.767]  You're going to have these pockets of prosperity, as you have now, and those will be mainly around the financial centers,
[02:40:29.059 --> 02:40:42.247]  Upscale resorts and military installations, like there will be certain parts of the country, maybe around Washington, D.C., New York, places like that, where they'll still have an economy, but that'll be all.
[02:40:42.247 --> 02:40:45.609]  Just like North Korea?
[02:40:45.609 --> 02:40:50.812]  Just like North Korea, where they've got the T-bone steaks and the fancy shops, and everybody else is starving to death?
[02:40:50.812 --> 02:40:58.156]  Well, that's been, that's a feudal nation, and we're becoming a feudal nation, where, you know, the top five or ten percent and their hangers-on,
[02:40:58.760 --> 02:41:04.561]  I have what they need, and the rest of the people just don't.
[02:41:04.561 --> 02:41:11.103]  We'll start breaking down, then, the current economic data that proves your statement, and then let's go back over the history.
[02:41:11.103 --> 02:41:27.906]  Well, as far as economic data is concerned, the most important number to look at is the debt load that's carried by the economy, because there you get the debt-to-equity ratio that's such an important indicator when you're out doing financial marketplace shopping.
[02:41:28.601 --> 02:41:32.762]  We have an economy now where the gross domestic product is about $14 trillion.
[02:41:32.762 --> 02:41:44.106]  Now, of that $14 trillion, probably 50% of it, or maybe a little bit less, but somewhere in that range, is what I call churning.
[02:41:44.106 --> 02:41:53.168]  That's just financial transactions going back and forth, and the reason that it's called part of the gross domestic product is the federal government can tax it.
[02:41:53.168 --> 02:41:58.250]  If it's taxable, it's called production, even if it's just a financial transfer or
[02:41:58.948 --> 02:42:06.311]  If it's simply based upon inflation, the way housing prices have been, that's called wealth, and of course that wealth is now disappearing.
[02:42:06.311 --> 02:42:21.578]  So if you have real production, say, in let's say in the $10 trillion a year range, our total debt load that we're carrying right now as a society, and that includes household debt, family debt, government debt, and business debt, is now pushing over $50 trillion.
[02:42:21.578 --> 02:42:26.160]  Now that doesn't even include the whole derivatives market, which we won't talk about right now.
[02:42:26.860 --> 02:42:30.662]  This is just the debt that's attached to the producing society.
[02:42:30.662 --> 02:42:40.027]  So if your debt, as a nation, is five times your income, five times your real production, you've got a major problem.
[02:42:40.027 --> 02:42:43.869]  And one reason you've got a major problem is that that debt is not free.
[02:42:43.869 --> 02:42:45.890]  You're paying service on that debt.
[02:42:45.890 --> 02:42:50.892]  And if you delay on paying any service on that debt, you're paying compound interest on the debt.
[02:42:50.892 --> 02:42:52.633]  So the debt is growing exponentially.
[02:42:53.231 --> 02:42:56.175]  Or as the real production is not growing at all.
[02:42:56.175 --> 02:43:02.943]  In fact, the real production today, if you take away the financial inflation, is actually stagnant or declining.
[02:43:02.943 --> 02:43:03.924]  Oh yeah, it's eroding.
[02:43:03.924 --> 02:43:05.766]  That's the definition of a recession.
[02:43:05.766 --> 02:43:07.848]  And real wages have been eroding.
[02:43:07.848 --> 02:43:09.891]  So the debt load is dragging the whole thing down.
[02:43:09.891 --> 02:43:12.434]  The debt load is crushing the producing economy.
[02:43:12.910 --> 02:43:22.636]  But the private bankers love it because through their fiat currencies they get to buy up every piece of real real estate and every commodity and every shred and fully brainwash and militarize the police.
[02:43:22.636 --> 02:43:27.519]  I keep talking to the police out there because they need to realize that if they go along with this
[02:43:28.750 --> 02:43:33.592]  Uh, that the globalists are going to be able to have their way and that's going to hurt them.
[02:43:33.592 --> 02:43:44.516]  Can you say anything to the apparatus that they intend to implement all this and to suppress us during this transition from free nation to absolute third world slave?
[02:43:44.516 --> 02:43:47.057]  Well, you have some fairly obvious things.
[02:43:47.057 --> 02:43:55.781]  I mean, you've got the full creation of the Department of Homeland Security, which puts the federal umbrella over all law enforcement in the United States.
[02:43:56.516 --> 02:44:04.240]  You've got the so-called Patriot Acts and other measures that are set up to erode civil liberties.
[02:44:04.240 --> 02:44:13.626]  And the whole thing, of course, is set up right now for a much greater degree of control of the population than we've had, but it's already happening, as you know.
[02:44:13.626 --> 02:44:17.368]  I mean, we've got the largest prison population in the world today.
[02:44:18.175 --> 02:44:19.876]  And it's growing all the time.
[02:44:19.876 --> 02:44:22.057]  And it's so absurdist that it's going to happen.
[02:44:22.057 --> 02:44:40.824]  Exactly, and it's so absurdist that they claim it's for Al-Qaeda, when the borders are open, the airports are open, and we know that's a fraud on its face, but I mean, you look at the whole attack pattern, the whole setup, it is all about suppressing the people, and then they say, no, it's about fighting Al-Qaeda, but by the way, Al-Qaeda is all misdemeanors now.
[02:44:40.824 --> 02:44:45.026]  Well, in the town where I live, they just had a full-page
[02:44:46.276 --> 02:44:46.577]  I think?
[02:45:06.658 --> 02:45:08.839]  That the local police are engaging in.
[02:45:08.839 --> 02:45:11.679]  And by the way, they've bought jumbotrons all over the country.
[02:45:11.679 --> 02:45:24.903]  The feds now are going to have flashing TVs like in Blade Runner or an even worse example would be Running Man announcing and they admit the Amber Alert now on billboards is going to flash.
[02:45:24.903 --> 02:45:28.944]  And they just had all over the country these admitted martial law drills where they said quote
[02:45:29.551 --> 02:45:30.972]  Yeah, Memphis was one that was pretty well publicized.
[02:45:30.972 --> 02:45:31.512]  Yes, it is.
[02:45:31.512 --> 02:45:32.173]  Yeah, it's beginning.
[02:45:32.173 --> 02:45:34.915]  People shouldn't think this is off in the future.
[02:45:34.915 --> 02:45:35.575]  This is started.
[02:45:59.847 --> 02:46:01.949]  Do you think the officers realize what's happening?
[02:46:01.949 --> 02:46:04.551]  Or do you think it's all about the power?
[02:46:04.551 --> 02:46:08.193]  Well, that's the tragedy, is that people have to have jobs.
[02:46:08.193 --> 02:46:10.975]  And so, you know, law enforcement looks pretty good.
[02:46:10.975 --> 02:46:12.777]  They promise you a lot.
[02:46:12.777 --> 02:46:15.018]  And so you have to buy into this.
[02:46:15.018 --> 02:46:23.024]  And I think, you know, you've really got to feel for the police and the people who are kind of roped into this out of economic necessity.
[02:46:23.024 --> 02:46:26.006]  They've got kids, they've got families, they've got to take care of them.
[02:46:26.006 --> 02:46:27.928]  So the easiest way to do it is to go along.
[02:46:28.433 --> 02:46:29.534]  This has always been the case.
[02:46:29.534 --> 02:46:32.457]  I mean, this is what the whole Nuremberg system was about.
[02:46:32.457 --> 02:46:36.301]  This is what the whole aftermath of Nazi Germany was about.
[02:46:36.301 --> 02:46:39.484]  They all came along and they said, well, we were just obeying orders.
[02:46:39.484 --> 02:46:42.988]  And I think what the Nuremberg trials proved is that that's no excuse.
[02:46:42.988 --> 02:46:46.071]  Every person has got to make a stand based upon their own conscience.
[02:46:46.880 --> 02:46:53.668]  Well, they're going to destroy the economy by design, not just to consolidate, but also, a lot of the public isn't going to get mad at the government.
[02:46:53.668 --> 02:47:01.658]  They're going to just say, we'll do whatever you say, just give us the Lexus and the Bobbles back, let us act tough.
[02:47:01.658 --> 02:47:03.961]  Or even, let's just give me a meal.
[02:47:05.154 --> 02:47:06.495]  Give me something to eat, you know?
[02:47:06.495 --> 02:47:13.619]  Yeah, I mean, it's... How bad do you think... Do you think it's going to be televised executions and open bowing down to the great leader?
[02:47:13.619 --> 02:47:17.741]  I mean, I think that's what it's probably going to develop into.
[02:47:17.741 --> 02:47:18.802]  That, I don't know.
[02:47:18.802 --> 02:47:27.767]  Because I certainly hope, I think as a lot of people do, that we will have the ability somehow to find a way out of this.
[02:47:27.767 --> 02:47:28.728]  And so I'm not going to...
[02:47:29.252 --> 02:47:32.933]  Make those kind of dire projections, but that's certainly the danger.
[02:47:32.933 --> 02:47:34.454]  Well, I mean, my point is that's what they'd like.
[02:47:34.454 --> 02:47:40.455]  A lot of people in the United States who may be able to find a way that we can overcome these problems.
[02:47:40.455 --> 02:47:49.358]  Well, how about local police and communities all, which are kind of waking up now, kind of like Ceausescu giving orders in Romania, nobody listens.
[02:47:49.358 --> 02:47:50.318]  Yeah, it can happen.
[02:47:50.318 --> 02:47:52.339]  I mean, there's a lot that people can do.
[02:47:52.339 --> 02:47:54.280]  Communities can organize.
[02:47:54.280 --> 02:47:58.901]  Communities can begin to take back their food supply, for instance, through co-ops, through community
[02:48:00.056 --> 02:48:02.157]  I mean, when did you quote, radicalize?
[02:48:02.157 --> 02:48:04.197]  When did you really see the big picture?
[02:48:04.197 --> 02:48:10.639]  I mean, was it incremental or did you realize finally one day, my God, we've got a real psychopaths running things.
[02:48:10.639 --> 02:48:14.461]  I mean, when did you really see this come into focus, just how diabolical it was?
[02:48:29.565 --> 02:48:40.513]  I began to study monetary reform back in the 1970s when I worked at the Jimmy Carter White House.
[02:48:40.513 --> 02:48:54.783]  It was at that time that I began to study the writings of C. H. Douglas, who was the founder of the British social credit movement, and he was putting together economic proposals for true economic democracy.
[02:48:55.823 --> 02:49:14.695]  And it was at that time I tried to organize a study group, in fact we had one meeting before Carter was voted out of office, to begin looking at serious economic reform because I realized then that the financial system that we had was really at fault, was really the root of the problem.
[02:49:14.695 --> 02:49:25.181]  The debt-based financial system under the Federal Reserve, where all of our money supply is created by bank lending, and that bank lending is in the control of financiers who
[02:49:26.036 --> 02:49:27.196]  Not only ran the U.S.
[02:49:27.196 --> 02:49:29.717]  economy, but ran the world economy.
[02:49:29.717 --> 02:49:32.558]  And that's when I really began to connect the dots.
[02:49:32.558 --> 02:49:52.283]  And then after I left the government, within a few weeks of leaving, I published my book on the Challenger disaster, called Challenger Revealed, where I exposed the cover-up of the involvement by the Reagan presidency and the Reagan White House in that flawed decision to launch Challenger.
[02:49:53.681 --> 02:50:07.886]  At that time, I began to write about economics and began to go back into my old interests and apply the social credit ideas to the current economic situation.
[02:50:07.886 --> 02:50:16.988]  And when I began to run all of the data, I was one of the very early people who began to predict early in 2007 that we had this crash underway.
[02:50:16.988 --> 02:50:22.090]  And since that time, as I've gone deeper and deeper into all of the ramifications of it,
[02:50:23.102 --> 02:50:36.946]  I've seen what's going on and then you have coming up on top of it all of the breakdown that is being used by the system to dominate people and to control politics and control our lives.
[02:50:36.946 --> 02:50:38.786]  Okay, we're 50 minutes into this interview.
[02:50:38.786 --> 02:50:45.148]  We're going to come back and just let Mr. Cook give you whatever information he thinks most important.
[02:50:45.148 --> 02:50:48.569]  This is vital info.
[02:50:48.569 --> 02:50:49.889]  It is a big idea
[02:50:51.044 --> 02:50:52.805]  A New World Order.
[02:50:52.805 --> 02:50:57.327]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:50:57.327 --> 02:51:00.529]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:51:00.529 --> 02:51:03.330]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:51:03.330 --> 02:51:06.511]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:51:06.511 --> 02:51:13.815]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:51:16.866 --> 02:51:22.290]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:51:22.290 --> 02:51:26.172]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:51:26.172 --> 02:51:28.734]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:51:28.734 --> 02:51:29.895]  Most people have no idea.
[02:51:29.895 --> 02:51:30.695]  They're not after money.
[02:51:30.695 --> 02:51:31.956]  They have all the money they need.
[02:51:31.956 --> 02:51:32.957]  They're after power.
[02:51:32.957 --> 02:51:34.098]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[02:51:45.625 --> 02:51:46.666]  You have been warned.
[02:51:47.927 --> 02:51:51.429]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:51:51.429 --> 02:51:56.852]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[02:51:56.852 --> 02:52:01.995]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[02:52:01.995 --> 02:52:13.122]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[02:52:13.502 --> 02:52:19.287]  The KDF dual media shower filter typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:52:19.287 --> 02:52:25.552]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[02:52:25.552 --> 02:52:26.593]  What about you?
[02:52:26.593 --> 02:52:28.615]  Order your KDF shower filter normally.

[02:54:06.636 --> 02:54:07.937]  Worked with NASA as an analyst.
[02:54:07.937 --> 02:54:11.939]  Written for some of the largest papers in the United States.
[02:54:11.939 --> 02:54:15.722]  And... A lot of you are going to get arrested.
[02:54:15.722 --> 02:54:17.463]  A lot of you are going to have your businesses taken.
[02:54:17.463 --> 02:54:19.865]  A lot of you are going to be tortured by men in black uniforms.
[02:54:20.922 --> 02:54:22.864]  Shaved heads, devil tats all over them.
[02:54:22.864 --> 02:54:26.167]  They've bred huge armies of them, most of them felons.
[02:54:26.167 --> 02:54:32.013]  I'm really sorry it had to happen to you, America, but that's what happens when you give in to tyranny.
[02:54:32.013 --> 02:54:34.716]  That's what happens when you don't care and you believe lies.
[02:54:34.716 --> 02:54:39.981]  Now, you can wake up if you'd like.
[02:54:39.981 --> 02:54:43.705]  You can decide to speak out now and warn people and
[02:54:45.405 --> 02:54:47.809]  Uh, but, uh, it's gonna be tough.
[02:54:47.809 --> 02:54:48.690]  Just know that.
[02:54:48.690 --> 02:54:53.297]  And we've tried our hardest to wake you up, and we're real sorry about reality, but that's just the way it is.
[02:54:53.297 --> 02:54:54.118]  We can't change that.
[02:54:54.895 --> 02:55:04.121]  There's a lot of that today, blaming those that bring you reality, instead of blaming the people that are actually doing it to you.
[02:55:04.121 --> 02:55:13.988]  Mr. Cook, please continue breaking down exactly how you think this is going to unfold, what's already unfolded, and then let's go back over how they did it, because there's no doubt it's by design.
[02:55:13.988 --> 02:55:18.671]  Bilderberg Group, two and a half years ago, reported, we went on air and said they're going to
[02:55:19.321 --> 02:55:22.122]  Well, you know, we can talk about how it got this way.
[02:55:22.122 --> 02:55:22.862]  I do want to try.
[02:55:35.847 --> 02:55:40.572]  If we could, Alex, sometime in the next hour to go over some economic ideas.
[02:55:40.572 --> 02:55:42.795]  Yeah, let's talk about some solutions, too.
[02:55:42.795 --> 02:55:43.575]  How we can fix it.
[02:55:43.575 --> 02:55:47.479]  Do you want to talk about that first, or do you want to go back and go through some of the history of it?
[02:55:47.479 --> 02:55:53.145]  I think it's important to break down the history, who we're dealing with, and now what they're doing, yes.
[02:55:53.145 --> 02:55:57.530]  Okay, well let's go back first and talk about some of the history of this.
[02:55:58.724 --> 02:56:21.777]  I process it a little bit differently, because a lot of people have talked about the Federal Reserve System, and of course the implementation of the Federal Reserve System in 1913 was indeed the real milestone in giving the financiers control over the United States economy and over the United States.
[02:56:21.777 --> 02:56:24.078]  But I want to take a step back from that, because
[02:56:25.173 --> 02:56:41.899]  One thing I've said, and I have a new article that'll be coming out in Global Research probably in the next day or two, where I point out that it has always been part of the plan of the financiers going back into the late 1900s to focus on taking down two nations.
[02:56:41.899 --> 02:56:51.882]  The two nations that most stood against financial domination in the late 1900s were, number one, Russia, and number two, the United States.
[02:56:52.717 --> 02:57:21.068]  Now, the way they took Russia down was by fomenting, financing, and paying for the Bolshevik Revolution, because it was the financiers from London, New York, Germany, France, who paid for the Communists to take over that country and to destroy what at that time was the most powerful continental nation in Europe, and also a very staunch Christian nation, which was Russia under the Tsars.
[02:57:21.658 --> 02:57:32.586]  Russia at that time had become an ally of the United States, and had become a very progressive, very prosperous nation, and they wanted to get rid of Russia as a force.
[02:57:32.586 --> 02:57:41.453]  And the same thing was done for the United States, and they saw the greatest danger to financier control of the world at that time, a potential alliance between
[02:57:41.994 --> 02:57:46.355]  The two big land nations who also were very staunch Christian nations.
[02:57:46.355 --> 02:57:48.696]  Now again, this is all mainstream.
[02:57:48.696 --> 02:57:49.056]  Exactly.
[02:57:49.056 --> 02:57:50.277]  This is all mainstream history.
[02:57:50.277 --> 02:57:53.798]  We're going to start the fourth hour now and we're going to go over all this, sir.
[02:57:53.798 --> 02:57:58.599]  And I'm going to try to let you cover as much as possible, but it's key to understand.
[02:57:58.599 --> 02:58:01.100]  We're not saying it's a communist conspiracy.
[02:58:01.100 --> 02:58:06.762]  The bankers, Carol Quigley's written Georgetown top professor, Bill Clinton's mentor, they created it.
[02:58:07.483 --> 02:58:08.523]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:59:29.488 --> 02:59:32.111]  We're in a no-holds-bar information war.
[02:59:32.111 --> 02:59:37.436]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[03:00:06.960 --> 03:00:11.703]  We are now into the fourth and final hour today on this Wednesday edition.
[03:00:11.703 --> 03:00:23.869]  Richard C. Cook is our guest analyst for NASA, for the Kennedy, for the Carter White House, worked in a lot of other areas, U.S.
[03:00:23.869 --> 03:00:36.316]  Treasury Department, on and on and on, expert in monetary reform, talking about the collapse of the economy, how it's being done by design, bringing us into a neo-serfdom or feudalism, a North Korean-style state.
[03:00:36.755 --> 03:00:53.280]  He had just gotten to the point of the central bank financiers bringing down Russia by publicly, the Bank of England and others, and Brooklyn, shipping in thousands of Brooklyners, to bring down the czars, not for the utopic communism, but for a banker utopia of slaves.
[03:00:53.280 --> 03:00:55.040]  Please continue, Mr. Cook.
[03:00:55.040 --> 03:01:04.763]  Well, and then you had over on the American side, you had, of course, the Federal Reserve system coming into being when the bankers took over the United States economy
[03:01:05.847 --> 03:01:12.952]  In 1913, and of course coming along with that was the 16th Amendment to the Constitution, where you instituted the income tax.
[03:01:12.952 --> 03:01:17.635]  The purpose of the income tax was to pay the interest on the permanent national debt.
[03:01:17.635 --> 03:01:35.167]  Now, I want to jump ahead, because during the subsequent decades, while the United States was being harnessed as the financier's military enforcer for the world, there was actually a significant power struggle within the United States between the forces that wanted to have
[03:01:35.783 --> 03:01:51.994]  A strong nation, a strong national economy, and this was primarily the program of the New Deal of Franklin Roosevelt, but Roosevelt was very ambiguous about it, and he allowed the banking system to continue to function.
[03:01:51.994 --> 03:02:02.041]  And it was after World War II, when the American economy began to decline through the tremendous deficits that were being run up during the Vietnam War,
[03:02:02.839 --> 03:02:12.641]  That the United States began to fall back into the control of the international financial world.
[03:02:12.641 --> 03:02:19.722]  By the late 1960s, the Vietnam War was sinking the United States deeper into debt.
[03:02:19.722 --> 03:02:28.264]  The problem at that time was made worse by very heavy federal expenditures under social programs, particularly Medicare and Medicaid.
[03:02:28.264 --> 03:02:30.184]  But when Nixon became president,
[03:02:31.151 --> 03:02:42.514]  His Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, came up with a plan where Saudi Arabia and the other OPEC nations would gradually increase the price of oil.
[03:02:42.514 --> 03:02:48.735]  And the profits for that were going to be used for the oil-producing nations to buy debt from the U.S.
[03:02:48.735 --> 03:02:49.715]  Treasury.
[03:02:49.715 --> 03:02:55.377]  So in other words, this is what we were going to do with our deficit from that point on.
[03:02:55.377 --> 03:03:00.218]  It was going to be sold overseas to other countries, particularly the OPEC oil-producing nations.
[03:03:00.925 --> 03:03:12.212]  That's why, over the decade of the 70s, by 1980, the cost of oil had been ratcheted up from $3.50 a barrel to $39.50 a barrel.
[03:03:12.212 --> 03:03:13.953]  And that's really a global program.
[03:03:13.953 --> 03:03:16.094]  That's really a covert global tax.
[03:03:16.094 --> 03:03:16.754]  It's a tax.
[03:03:16.754 --> 03:03:22.158]  It was a de facto tax on the economy, and the plan worked.
[03:03:22.158 --> 03:03:29.062]  The petrodollar and dollar hegemony were born, and the dollar at that point became the world's reserve currency.
[03:03:29.864 --> 03:03:42.147]  The dollars could flood the world only because, in 1971, the Nixon administration abandoned the dollar's gold peg as a basis for international currency exchange.
[03:03:42.147 --> 03:03:52.570]  Now, currencies could float freely in the world markets, and so you had a tremendous period of currency speculation and worldwide inflation.
[03:03:52.570 --> 03:03:55.591]  From this point on, the bankers were in control.
[03:03:55.591 --> 03:03:56.811]  The economies of the world
[03:03:57.301 --> 03:03:58.042]  We're good to go.
[03:04:20.220 --> 03:04:21.161]  It is a big idea.
[03:04:48.297 --> 03:04:50.059]  A New World Order.
[03:04:50.059 --> 03:04:54.964]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[03:04:54.964 --> 03:04:57.787]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[03:04:57.787 --> 03:05:00.590]  Could their objective be world domination?
[03:05:00.590 --> 03:05:03.773]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:05:03.773 --> 03:05:11.101]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:05:14.108 --> 03:05:19.551]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[03:05:19.551 --> 03:05:23.434]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[03:05:23.434 --> 03:05:25.995]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[03:05:25.995 --> 03:05:27.156]  Most people have no idea.
[03:05:27.156 --> 03:05:27.936]  They're not after money.
[03:05:27.936 --> 03:05:29.217]  They have all the money they need.
[03:05:29.217 --> 03:05:30.218]  They're after power.
[03:05:30.218 --> 03:05:31.358]  That's what they're after.

[03:05:45.182 --> 03:05:48.523]  Hello, this is Tom with HempUSA.org.
[03:05:48.523 --> 03:05:56.244]  Most of you have been hearing my ads for the past few months, and it's no secret that the economy is failing and prices are rising in all sectors.
[03:05:56.244 --> 03:06:04.086]  If you've been thinking of a nutrient-dense daily food source and a storable food for yourself and family, the time to act is now.
[03:06:04.086 --> 03:06:10.367]  At HempUSA.org, we still believe that food will be your greatest asset in these trying times ahead.
[03:06:11.007 --> 03:06:17.769]  Please call 1-908-691-2608 and see what our powder, seeds, and oil can do for you.
[03:06:17.769 --> 03:06:20.570]  Beware, be smart, and be ready!
[03:06:20.570 --> 03:06:22.651]  Call 908-691-2608 or visit us at hempusa.org.
[03:06:26.932 --> 03:06:33.279]  Families need this high quality natural food source for its low price and long storage shelf life.
[03:06:33.279 --> 03:06:37.224]  This incredible food source should be a staple part of your diet every day.
[03:06:37.224 --> 03:06:39.086]  Call 908-691-2608 or visit us at hempusa.org today!
[03:06:44.528 --> 03:06:46.129]  Wake up, Protestant America!
[03:06:46.129 --> 03:06:49.811]  There is an ecumenical movement now being planned to join church and state.
[03:06:49.811 --> 03:06:55.855]  This confederation of Evangelicals, Catholics, and Protestant denominations will form one huge political voting bloc.
[03:06:55.855 --> 03:06:59.917]  Their agenda is enforcement of religious worship and morality by legislation.
[03:06:59.917 --> 03:07:03.319]  Our forefathers wrote the Bill of Rights to guarantee all Americans this freedom.
[03:07:03.519 --> 03:07:04.679]  Liberty of conscience.
[03:07:04.679 --> 03:07:09.340]  History and the Bible prove to them that these two systems, church and state, must be kept separate.
[03:07:09.340 --> 03:07:13.401]  It must be our love of God and of country that prompts or constrains us.
[03:07:13.401 --> 03:07:16.002]  This will change the character, not civil enforcement.
[03:07:16.002 --> 03:07:21.303]  From history we saw that when church and state united, known as Papal Rome, religious intolerance resulted.
[03:07:21.303 --> 03:07:24.964]  This union would go directly contrary to the great principles of our nation.
[03:07:24.964 --> 03:07:27.545]  America and Papal Rome are uniting in this agenda.
[03:07:27.745 --> 03:07:30.526]  Protestant America, awake before it is too late!
[03:07:30.526 --> 03:07:32.447]  The prophecies are fast fulfilling!
[03:07:32.447 --> 03:07:34.027]  Jesus is coming soon!
[03:07:34.027 --> 03:07:36.548]  For free materials, call 888-211-1715.
[03:07:36.548 --> 03:07:45.531]  Or write The Bible Says, Box 99, Lenore City, Tennessee, 37771.
[03:07:45.531 --> 03:07:51.113]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:07:58.326 --> 03:08:07.112]  Richard C. Cook, White House analyst, advisor, syndicated columnist, analyzing what's happening in the economy.
[03:08:07.112 --> 03:08:18.300]  Please continue with the history of the private owners of all of us, who just so happen to be psychopathic eugenicists and say they want to get rid of us, who happen to control our police.
[03:08:18.300 --> 03:08:19.541]  Please continue.
[03:08:19.541 --> 03:08:20.882]  Okay, thanks Alex.
[03:08:20.882 --> 03:08:27.787]  Let me just mention my email address again for people who want to write in with questions or support what we're doing.
[03:08:28.707 --> 03:08:32.710]  It's economicsanityatgmail.com.
[03:08:32.710 --> 03:08:36.953]  Would you like in the hour we've got left later to take some phone calls?
[03:08:36.953 --> 03:08:38.274]  I think we could do that, yeah.
[03:08:38.274 --> 03:08:39.195]  Okay, 1-800-259-9231, 1-800-259-9231, or the local studio number, 512-646-5400.
[03:08:39.195 --> 03:08:40.096]  We'll do that, though, later.
[03:08:40.096 --> 03:08:40.436]  Go ahead.
[03:08:40.436 --> 03:08:41.057]  Okay, yeah.
[03:08:41.057 --> 03:08:44.779]  I want to continue doing some of the historical background here and try to get to some of
[03:08:55.345 --> 03:08:56.025]  We're good to go.
[03:09:18.996 --> 03:09:21.177]  Now we're going to purchase U.S.
[03:09:21.177 --> 03:09:26.580]  Treasury securities and run up the price of oil to pay for those.
[03:09:26.580 --> 03:09:32.524]  This plan was really the plan of the Secretary of State under Nixon, Henry Kissinger.
[03:09:32.524 --> 03:09:35.526]  And another thing that it did, it made the U.S.
[03:09:35.526 --> 03:09:39.548]  dependent on Middle Eastern oil and turned the U.S.
[03:09:39.548 --> 03:09:48.173]  into the power behind the financiers' ambition to dominate the region, particularly through working with the nation of Israel.
[03:09:49.238 --> 03:09:59.504]  So now, the United States, which had liberated Europe from the Nazis, we also began to be the ones who were going to fight and die for the financiers in the Middle East.
[03:09:59.504 --> 03:10:08.208]  And of course, the final conquest of Iraq starting in 2003 and the planned war against Iran are phases of that.
[03:10:08.208 --> 03:10:15.292]  Now, meanwhile, back here in the United States, through the financiers' control of the Federal Reserve System,
[03:10:15.939 --> 03:10:22.961]  The producing economy was wrecked through the Fed-induced recession of 1979 to 1983.
[03:10:22.961 --> 03:10:35.926]  Now, that's when Volcker raised interest rates to the highest in history to combat the inflation, which the financiers themselves had caused through the oil price shocks.
[03:10:35.926 --> 03:10:38.227]  Then, when Clinton was elected president in 1992,
[03:10:39.676 --> 03:10:40.236]  The U.S.
[03:10:40.236 --> 03:11:04.135]  producing economy, which had been devastated by the shutdown of the factories and the export of jobs under Reagan and the first Bush, well, the work of wrecking the economy was completed by Clinton's embrace of NAFTA, which has largely eliminated family farming in favor of financier-controlled agribusiness in North America, throughout U.S., Canada, and Mexico.
[03:11:04.135 --> 03:11:07.658]  And, of course, the deregulation of the financial industry, which had begun
[03:11:08.534 --> 03:11:14.158]  In a big way, during the Reagan and Bush years, was accelerated under Clinton.
[03:11:14.158 --> 03:11:18.041]  Now, by this time, the only thing that was floating the U.S.
[03:11:18.041 --> 03:11:20.463]  economy were the bubbles.
[03:11:20.463 --> 03:11:25.587]  You had the merger acquisition bubble of the 80s, and that ended in the George H.W.
[03:11:25.587 --> 03:11:31.010]  Bush recession that brought Clinton into the presidency in 92.
[03:11:31.010 --> 03:11:37.235]  Then during the 90s, you had the dot-com bubble that was fueled not by American savings, but by foreign investment.
[03:11:38.174 --> 03:11:54.702]  And it was the capital gains on the stock price inflations and counting trust funds like Social Security as part of budgetary assets in the federal budget that allowed Clinton to balance the federal budget during the last three years of his presidency.
[03:11:54.702 --> 03:12:00.445]  But it all ended, as we know, when the dot-com bubble burst in the crash of 2000 and 2001, and Americans lost in that
[03:12:04.635 --> 03:12:12.841]  Crashed $7 trillion of wealth, including the pension funds of hundreds of thousands of people.
[03:12:12.841 --> 03:12:21.167]  Now, after that came along the Bush bubbles, because Bush, as you know, did not attempt to rebuild the economy.
[03:12:21.167 --> 03:12:33.316]  What he did was cut income taxes to the highest tax brackets and allow Alan Greenspan to create the housing bubble, followed by the equity fund bubble, the commercial real estate bubble,
[03:12:33.891 --> 03:12:34.452]  Thank you.
[03:12:53.283 --> 03:13:00.008]  And these are the ones that when they go down are going to take the livelihood of millions, maybe hundreds of millions of people with it.
[03:13:00.008 --> 03:13:03.650]  And I would call those hyper-predatory bubbles.
[03:13:03.650 --> 03:13:05.071]  That's correct.
[03:13:05.071 --> 03:13:09.434]  And that's all that's left because the producing economy can't support the nation anymore.
[03:13:09.434 --> 03:13:12.596]  There's nothing left and these are the last bubbles.
[03:13:12.596 --> 03:13:16.178]  This is the predatory system.
[03:13:16.178 --> 03:13:18.620]  This is the cannibalistic system.
[03:13:18.620 --> 03:13:19.701]  And that's what they've stated.
[03:13:19.701 --> 03:13:22.983]  All that's left is war, military, cops, checkpoints, cameras.
[03:13:24.026 --> 03:13:29.270]  And it's, I just can't believe this once great nation is just going to be, oh my God.
[03:13:29.270 --> 03:13:31.411]  But the people are waking up now like never before.
[03:13:31.411 --> 03:13:33.312]  I don't know if they're going to get away with it.
[03:13:33.312 --> 03:13:36.835]  I mean, this hellish thing they plan to set up.
[03:13:36.835 --> 03:13:45.180]  Well, if we can, what I'd like to do is go through some of what I think are the solutions that we have to start working with.
[03:13:45.180 --> 03:13:46.221]  Because we've got to be smart about it.
[03:13:46.221 --> 03:13:47.322]  Okay, solutions are great.
[03:13:47.322 --> 03:13:49.183]  And I want to take some time to talk about solutions.
[03:13:49.183 --> 03:13:51.925]  We did that yesterday with Geo, you know, Geo Griffin.
[03:13:52.486 --> 03:14:00.209]  My issue here is that the establishment has electronic voting machines that engage in fraud in most of the country.
[03:14:00.209 --> 03:14:05.010]  We know that the government, the CIA, runs the big three electronic companies.
[03:14:05.010 --> 03:14:09.172]  We know they're ignoring, I mean, 91% want to control the borders, they say no.
[03:14:09.172 --> 03:14:09.772]  Gallup poll.
[03:14:09.772 --> 03:14:14.014]  80-something percent want to end the war, they say no, it never ends.
[03:14:14.014 --> 03:14:16.755]  They just do what they want, when they want, how they want.
[03:14:18.599 --> 03:14:21.961]  It's good to know what monetary solutions are, and I agree with a lot of your ideas.
[03:14:21.961 --> 03:14:24.703]  A lot of other experts I interview do as well.
[03:14:24.703 --> 03:14:42.175]  It's just that I guess it's important to know who to blame so that as they implode things, I think the solution is, first off, people need to know this was done by design, or the same people that did this will always offer a new solution to the problem they created, which is greater control for them.
[03:14:42.175 --> 03:14:46.377]  Well, that's certainly correct, and you can see that in the presidential campaigns.
[03:14:46.377 --> 03:14:47.138]  You can see that
[03:14:48.193 --> 03:14:53.939]  You can't see it so much in the McCain campaign, because John McCain says everything is just great as it is.
[03:14:53.939 --> 03:15:10.395]  But when you get into the solutions being offered by Hillary Clinton, for example, and even to some extent Obama, although I don't think Obama is quite as much a part of that establishment as Hillary Clinton is, essentially you're saying, put me back, trust us, and we'll fix it for you.
[03:15:12.409 --> 03:15:15.531]  Well, yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.
[03:15:15.531 --> 03:15:18.234]  Okay, well, let's go ahead and get into the solutions.
[03:15:18.234 --> 03:15:27.661]  I just want to make clear here that they have got us tied down, and it's going to be hard to have these solutions, but I just want to be clear about that.
[03:15:27.661 --> 03:15:39.610]  Well, I think that's true, and I guess from my point of view, being someone who's worked in this field, I've tried to get a meeting with Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson, and of course have not been granted an audience.
[03:15:40.365 --> 03:15:52.094]  But obviously there has to be a political revolution in order to get people into power in the White House who can make a difference and who can bring the reformers in.
[03:15:52.094 --> 03:15:54.376]  But that's the problem.
[03:15:54.376 --> 03:15:57.018]  You would think of the word reformer to fix a problem.
[03:15:57.018 --> 03:15:58.099]  Nothing's broken.
[03:15:58.099 --> 03:16:03.423]  The war on drugs, more drugs are shipped in by them, they put more of us in their private prisons owned by banks that launder the money.
[03:16:03.943 --> 03:16:04.543]  It's not broken.
[03:16:04.543 --> 03:16:06.044]  The war on terror is not broken.
[03:16:06.044 --> 03:16:07.964]  They mean to stay in Iraq for 100 years.
[03:16:07.964 --> 03:16:11.346]  They meant to sow seeds of insurrection, divide the country in three parts.
[03:16:11.346 --> 03:16:12.686]  It's been a great plan.
[03:16:12.686 --> 03:16:13.606]  Mission is accomplished.
[03:16:13.606 --> 03:16:14.767]  When Bush said that, he meant it.
[03:16:14.767 --> 03:16:16.587]  It's just not the mission we were told.
[03:16:16.587 --> 03:16:18.088]  And it's the same thing here.
[03:16:18.088 --> 03:16:21.169]  You know, I understand that there are reforms that can pull us out of this.
[03:16:21.169 --> 03:16:24.070]  It's not even too late, according to Ron Paul and others.
[03:16:24.070 --> 03:16:28.111]  The problem is, the establishment isn't going to allow that to happen.
[03:16:28.111 --> 03:16:30.692]  They preemptively took over the voting machines in the last 20 years.
[03:16:31.252 --> 03:16:34.215]  They preemptively pre-placed and brainwashed police.
[03:16:34.215 --> 03:16:41.961]  I mean, they have premeditatedly been really setting all the dominoes up here for a long time.
[03:16:41.961 --> 03:16:42.322]  Go ahead.
[03:16:42.322 --> 03:16:43.523]  I'm not trying to be negative.
[03:16:43.523 --> 03:16:47.206]  I'm just trying to let people assess just how serious it is.
[03:16:47.206 --> 03:16:49.007]  I think that's so, yeah.
[03:16:49.007 --> 03:16:51.289]  And I certainly would not argue with that.
[03:16:51.289 --> 03:16:56.714]  But if anyone has any hope to try to reform anything,
[03:16:57.253 --> 03:17:12.777]  I think we need to realize that all of these manifestations that are going on of terror, of state terror, of internal crackdowns, of internal collapse, all of this is happening because we have a failed economy.
[03:17:12.777 --> 03:17:22.439]  And in order to make any progress or any headway at all into getting out of this situation, the economy of the United States has to be rebuilt.
[03:17:23.411 --> 03:17:24.872]  Uh, from the ground up.
[03:17:24.872 --> 03:17:30.955]  And there are three areas where somebody has got to take responsibility for making changes.
[03:17:30.955 --> 03:17:34.417]  And let me tell you what I think those three areas are.
[03:17:34.417 --> 03:17:36.318]  One is American family farming.
[03:17:36.318 --> 03:17:40.080]  Because a nation that cannot feed itself cannot exist.
[03:17:40.080 --> 03:17:41.340]  Oh, I agree.
[03:17:41.340 --> 03:17:42.881]  I think we've got to face that.
[03:17:42.881 --> 03:17:44.682]  Get back to self-sufficiency.
[03:17:44.682 --> 03:17:47.403]  Those are things we can take on ourselves, yes.
[03:17:47.403 --> 03:17:50.645]  There has to be the ability for us to be able to feed ourselves
[03:17:51.509 --> 03:17:55.908]  uh... within our own boundaries using our own resources and we can do that
[03:17:56.619 --> 03:18:00.540]  If we set out to do it, and if we have the policies in place that can accomplish that.
[03:18:00.540 --> 03:18:19.706]  But that's why, so we can have our solution, we've got to block their Real ID, their Animal ID, their Premises ID, which was written by the Big Agra, to shut down family farms and ranches, have inspectors on your land, thousand dollar a day fines for no reason, absolute bureaucracies of little environmental control freaks running around foaming at the mouth.
[03:18:19.706 --> 03:18:22.407]  Yes, yes we do, absolutely.
[03:18:22.407 --> 03:18:24.428]  And then we've got to rebuild the infrastructure.
[03:18:25.239 --> 03:18:36.844]  We've got to rebuild the streets, the bridges, the railroad systems, the mass transit systems, and... And you, sir?
[03:18:36.844 --> 03:18:48.170]  And along with that, we've got to rebuild the soft services, the health services, and the educational services, and we've got to be able to do that by controlling the monetary system.
[03:18:48.170 --> 03:18:52.732]  So the underlying reform that has to be made is of the monetary system.
[03:18:53.416 --> 03:18:58.099]  And that's what I've been arguing now over the last year and a half.
[03:18:58.099 --> 03:18:59.580]  Let me just mention Ron Paul.
[03:18:59.580 --> 03:19:01.821]  You brought him up.
[03:19:01.821 --> 03:19:09.626]  He has made history as the first major presidential candidate ever to call for the abolishment of the Federal Reserve.
[03:19:09.626 --> 03:19:11.968]  Yes, we now have those key ideas being introduced.
[03:19:11.968 --> 03:19:16.031]  Yeah, and he's absolutely right, and he's done a great service by doing that.
[03:19:16.031 --> 03:19:22.655]  Because the very first thing that a president who is truly a president of the American people has to do
[03:19:23.590 --> 03:19:24.150]  It is a big idea.
[03:19:48.539 --> 03:19:50.300]  A New World Order.
[03:19:50.300 --> 03:19:55.181]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new world government.
[03:19:55.181 --> 03:19:58.022]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[03:19:58.022 --> 03:20:00.803]  Put their objective be world domination.
[03:20:00.803 --> 03:20:03.984]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:20:03.984 --> 03:20:11.306]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:20:14.332 --> 03:20:19.776]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[03:21:41.041 --> 03:21:47.303]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[03:21:47.303 --> 03:21:50.925]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[03:21:50.925 --> 03:21:53.366]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[03:21:53.366 --> 03:21:56.407]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[03:21:56.407 --> 03:22:02.149]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[03:22:02.149 --> 03:22:06.071]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[03:22:46.670 --> 03:22:52.752]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of disease such as cancer or diabetes?
[03:22:52.752 --> 03:22:58.695]  Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat, what we drink, the environment, and our high-stress lifestyles.
[03:22:58.695 --> 03:23:02.856]  It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain, and eventually disease.
[03:23:02.856 --> 03:23:07.738]  The easiest way to reduce disease-causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[03:23:08.018 --> 03:23:16.501]  At SnyderHealth.com we offer a full line of alkaline water ionizers from Jupiter Science, the leader in water ionization technology for over 25 years.

[03:23:52.620 --> 03:23:54.001]  Richard C. Cook is our guest.
[03:23:54.001 --> 03:23:57.163]  We're going to start taking phone calls coming up in the next segment.
[03:23:57.163 --> 03:23:59.785]  We're talking about Congressman Ron Paul.
[03:23:59.785 --> 03:24:03.608]  I have him up on the document cam for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[03:24:03.608 --> 03:24:08.151]  The fourth hour becomes a television show for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[03:24:08.151 --> 03:24:11.613]  Also for people to listen to the InfoWars radio internet streams.
[03:24:11.613 --> 03:24:15.116]  We a lot of times do little interviews during the breaks as well.
[03:24:16.067 --> 03:24:22.170]  As we'll do during the next break with Mr. Cook, and we'll come back at the 33 after and start taking some calls in the time we have left.
[03:24:22.170 --> 03:24:23.791]  We'll obviously have to have Mr. Cook back.
[03:24:23.791 --> 03:24:28.374]  Continue with the monetary reform ideas that you have, sir.
[03:24:28.374 --> 03:24:41.521]  Well, let me just mention, I will have an article coming out in the next couple days on a global research that will go into what we've been talking about today, Alex, in a lot of detail.
[03:24:42.333 --> 03:24:50.576]  And so people can take a look at that, and also they can write me on economicsanity at gmail dot com with questions that they have.
[03:24:50.576 --> 03:25:02.759]  Now, one thing I also wanted to mention about Ron Paul's candidacy is that it proves, despite what a lot of people say, that the public is ready to listen to new ideas.
[03:25:02.759 --> 03:25:08.421]  But even progressive analysts, including, I have to say, Ralph Nader,
[03:25:09.367 --> 03:25:24.084]  Uh, who says he's running for president again are so locked into outmoded concepts that they do not understand, they do not realize that a completely new type of monetary system is needed to really achieve economic democracy.
[03:25:24.084 --> 03:25:27.468]  Well, that's because their strategists tell them the public can't grasp it.
[03:25:27.975 --> 03:25:30.417]  And so they just go with soundbites themselves.
[03:25:30.417 --> 03:25:32.038]  That is correct.
[03:25:32.038 --> 03:25:33.078]  It's all very stagnant.
[03:25:33.078 --> 03:25:35.160]  So break down the monetary system.
[03:25:35.160 --> 03:25:38.862]  How do we extricate ourselves first out of their control, abolish the Fed?
[03:25:38.862 --> 03:25:41.504]  We have to educate people first, so that's happening.
[03:25:41.504 --> 03:25:44.686]  Secondarily, then, what system do you like?
[03:25:44.686 --> 03:25:51.891]  Being a monetary expert with the Treasury Department, working in the White House, being an analyst for NASA, you know, studying this at the White House level.
[03:25:51.891 --> 03:25:54.213]  What do you and other experts you confer with?
[03:25:54.213 --> 03:25:56.214]  I mean, how would you reverse what we see here?
[03:25:56.874 --> 03:26:05.860]  Let me put out a concept first, very briefly, and then I'll give some specific ideas that I and other monetary reformers are promoting.
[03:26:05.860 --> 03:26:17.669]  The basic concept that must be understood, that people do not understand today, and that I've been writing about now in my writings for the past year and a half, is to look at what is credit.
[03:26:17.669 --> 03:26:24.894]  Credit is a power of nature that is truly part of what we call the human commons, you know, the common heritage
[03:26:25.737 --> 03:26:26.637]  Of mankind.
[03:26:26.637 --> 03:26:42.303]  Credit allows a society to create value by using the ability that we have to draw out of our future productivity into what we can create and use today.
[03:26:42.303 --> 03:26:43.563]  Now, that sounds complicated.
[03:26:43.563 --> 03:26:44.944]  It's a form of leveraging.
[03:26:44.944 --> 03:26:50.346]  But what it means is, yes, it's a form of leveraging, but it is a public utility.
[03:26:50.346 --> 03:26:53.927]  It is a public utility as water is a public utility.
[03:26:54.500 --> 03:26:57.645]  Or as electricity is a public utility.
[03:26:57.645 --> 03:27:06.720]  The management of credit should never be given away or privatized to individuals or corporations who manipulate it for profit.
[03:27:07.375 --> 03:27:10.316]  That's what the banks have done, and it is the privatization of credit.
[03:27:10.316 --> 03:27:11.797]  Well, they've abused the hell out of it.
[03:27:11.797 --> 03:27:15.378]  I mean, they've abused just the complete daylights out of it.
[03:27:15.378 --> 03:27:16.138]  That's correct.
[03:27:16.138 --> 03:27:27.082]  At every single level, aggressively trying to hurt economies, trying to destroy economies, so they can consolidate as a business model, stated in their own documents.
[03:27:27.082 --> 03:27:35.605]  That is correct, and it's this privatization of credit through the banking systems that has loaded humanity with the tremendous burden of debt
[03:27:36.607 --> 03:27:51.177]  It's made short-term profits the highest priority of everything that's done in the business, and it's made modern industry really as much a curse as it is a blessing, and it's this privatization of credit that has to be changed.
[03:27:51.177 --> 03:28:02.986]  So, I have, and this is work I've done with a lot of other people who are involved in the monetary reform movement around the world that people really need to become aware of.
[03:28:02.986 --> 03:28:05.728]  There are three things that I'm proposing.
[03:28:06.536 --> 03:28:13.060]  The first is a guaranteed income, which will be accomplished through what we call the National Dividend.
[03:28:13.060 --> 03:28:20.225]  Now you've heard of the Alaska Permanent Fund, where every year, every resident of Alaska is given a stipend.
[03:28:20.225 --> 03:28:25.068]  Yeah, it's the comprehensive annual financial reports that have trillions of dollars off-budget.
[03:28:25.632 --> 03:28:36.600]  And so, absolutely, instead of giving all of this investment capital to offshore corporations, take it back over by the government, and then have it distributed equally to the population.
[03:28:36.600 --> 03:28:37.301]  That's correct.
[03:28:37.301 --> 03:28:46.848]  In my estimate, and this is in a global research article I wrote last year, which is called An Emergency Program of Monetary Reform for the United States,
[03:28:47.665 --> 03:28:54.829]  Calculates the national dividend where we are right now at $12,000 per capita annually.
[03:28:54.829 --> 03:29:00.792]  Now you can compare that to the $600 per person that Bush is about to send you back on your tax rebate.
[03:29:00.792 --> 03:29:06.114]  What I'm saying is that a national dividend should amount to at least at this point $12,000
[03:29:08.070 --> 03:29:09.771]  The show continues at InfoWars.com on those streams.
[03:29:35.768 --> 03:29:38.757]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:38.757 --> 03:29:42.367]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:46.044 --> 03:29:48.025]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[03:29:48.025 --> 03:29:54.987]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[03:29:54.987 --> 03:30:03.390]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[03:30:03.390 --> 03:30:09.112]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[03:30:09.292 --> 03:30:11.133]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[03:30:11.133 --> 03:30:13.313]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[03:30:13.313 --> 03:30:17.855]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[03:30:17.855 --> 03:30:20.075]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[03:30:20.075 --> 03:30:27.838]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[03:30:45.629 --> 03:30:46.269]  Greetings!
[03:30:46.269 --> 03:30:52.813]  My name is Dr. Bule Von Schacht, with the White Paper Chronicles, from the main polluted stream media.
[03:30:52.813 --> 03:30:56.856]  I'm here to expose a fraud and an all-around un-American stinker.
[03:30:57.372 --> 03:30:58.993]  His name is Steve Schenk.
[03:30:58.993 --> 03:31:01.514]  His radio show called Fearless Radio.
[03:31:01.514 --> 03:31:06.576]  He says solution to all the craziness in America is just get independent and healthy.

[03:33:10.917 --> 03:33:15.538]  Listen to me very carefully, people that serve the government.
[03:33:15.538 --> 03:33:23.500]  The sadistic, cold-blooded families that run the New World Order, that own the private banks, that own our governments.
[03:33:23.500 --> 03:33:32.223]  It's all illegitimate, it's done through fraud, but they need a police state apparatus and propaganda to be able to secure it, hold it, and expand it.
[03:33:33.743 --> 03:33:35.584]  And they do this in phases.
[03:33:35.584 --> 03:33:42.006]  If we do not have a renaissance, an awakening to this, an open debate about this, we are going to be hurt very, very badly.
[03:33:42.006 --> 03:33:44.968]  We're already seeing just the leading edge of the storm.
[03:33:44.968 --> 03:33:48.869]  And it gets more and more intense as we get deeper into it.
[03:33:48.869 --> 03:33:52.591]  So I know a lot of you won't listen now, but you'll listen later as it gets harder and harder.
[03:33:52.591 --> 03:33:57.933]  It is in 99.9% of our interest to not go along with this.
[03:33:57.933 --> 03:34:00.014]  This is hyper-predatory.
[03:34:00.669 --> 03:34:02.250]  They believe in social Darwinism.
[03:34:02.250 --> 03:34:08.916]  They believe hurting innocent people, killing, enslaving, bankrupting is good for the race.
[03:34:08.916 --> 03:34:10.377]  They believe it's their right to rule.
[03:34:10.377 --> 03:34:11.719]  This is their own statements.
[03:34:11.719 --> 03:34:18.204]  The head of the CFR, Richard Enhance, publicly, they published this, said, the whole global warming thing's fake.
[03:34:18.204 --> 03:34:21.827]  It's all about making humans the enemy and the state waging war.
[03:34:21.827 --> 03:34:24.249]  It's all about tracking and controlling our every movement.
[03:34:24.249 --> 03:34:25.871]  It's a new level of bureaucracy.
[03:34:26.712 --> 03:34:28.696]  The war on terror they admit is totally fake.
[03:34:28.696 --> 03:34:36.151]  Gary Hart admitted two days ago, just broke up on InfoWars.com, the WeAreChange video, said, yeah, our government stages terror attacks.
[03:34:36.151 --> 03:34:37.053]  And we'll stage them again.
[03:34:37.739 --> 03:34:39.341]  I mean, it's all happening.
[03:34:39.341 --> 03:34:41.543]  Now, Hart helped write the Homeland Security Plan.
[03:34:41.543 --> 03:34:43.345]  He called for terror attacks.
[03:34:43.345 --> 03:34:51.913]  Richard C. Cook, why do you think Gary Hart and Zbigniew Brzezinski and others are suddenly coming out and telling Congress and others, hey, our government could stage attacks?
[03:34:51.913 --> 03:34:53.575]  Does that show splits?
[03:34:53.575 --> 03:34:59.421]  Why do we see Rockefeller coming and trying to take ExxonMobil chairmanship away from Rex Tillerson?
[03:35:00.061 --> 03:35:07.606]  I mean, I do see, not fake, because they're not really publicizing it, but I'm seeing real friction within the establishment.
[03:35:07.606 --> 03:35:11.108]  Is this kind of, at the moment of truth, really decapitating the U.S.
[03:35:11.108 --> 03:35:13.409]  and bringing us into this enslavement?
[03:35:13.409 --> 03:35:20.974]  Are some of their people going, come on, this is too dangerous, this is too intense, they're waking up to us, they're not going to go along with it?
[03:35:20.974 --> 03:35:26.598]  Or is this kind of like the high command that liked Hitler at first, but by 1942, wanting to get rid of him?
[03:35:26.598 --> 03:35:28.779]  I mean, is this some sanity, or what's happening?
[03:35:29.239 --> 03:35:51.360]  Well, my opinion is that there is some sanity that is creeping in, because a lot of these people like Brzezinski, for example, really believed that they were going to build a strong America, and that America was going to be the nation that ruled the world, and now America's being dumped in the trash by the international financiers who've used us and abused us and don't need us anymore.
[03:35:51.360 --> 03:35:53.142]  We're being taken down deliberately.
[03:35:53.712 --> 03:36:00.455]  And so I think some of the people who formerly were part of the problem are realizing they've got to be part of the solution.
[03:36:00.455 --> 03:36:09.958]  And I do know, and I can tell you this, having worked in the federal government for 32 years, there are many patriotic Americans who work in the federal government.
[03:36:09.958 --> 03:36:17.361]  You should have heard some of the things that I heard said about Bush, about the Bush administration, about the false terror attacks.
[03:36:17.361 --> 03:36:23.003]  When I was in the government, there are a lot of people, I think, who are ready to be part of
[03:36:23.644 --> 03:36:27.927]  A new movement for American nationalism and take our country back.
[03:36:27.927 --> 03:36:28.648]  Absolutely.
[03:36:28.648 --> 03:36:30.449]  That's why we have a lot of friends.
[03:36:30.449 --> 03:36:31.750]  That's why I'm still alive.
[03:36:31.750 --> 03:36:36.174]  That's, I mean, you know, the globalists are not invincible.
[03:36:36.174 --> 03:36:40.117]  They have been unified, but now at the moment of truth, there is some rebellion.
[03:36:40.117 --> 03:36:42.198]  And so, you know, there is a silver lining here.
[03:36:42.198 --> 03:36:44.320]  I want to break it down this way.
[03:36:44.320 --> 03:36:46.342]  Andrew Jackson was in his own time.
[03:36:46.342 --> 03:36:50.585]  Andrew Jackson did some horrible things in today's perspective, but in his time,
[03:36:51.226 --> 03:36:54.189]  From his view, he really thought he was serving the people.
[03:36:54.189 --> 03:36:56.372]  He really wouldn't take money from his office.
[03:36:56.372 --> 03:36:59.036]  You know, he, I mean, it was manifest destiny.
[03:36:59.036 --> 03:37:06.626]  It was survival of the fittest, but he really was believing it was for the greater good of the general public, at least in a subset, racially.
[03:37:06.966 --> 03:37:10.949]  I'm not defending that, but you have to respect that he really believed what he was doing.
[03:37:10.949 --> 03:37:15.773]  This predator class revels in going after the smart and intelligent.
[03:37:15.773 --> 03:37:17.034]  They want to dumb down the mass.
[03:37:17.034 --> 03:37:20.896]  They want to carry out dumbing down, disenfranchisement of everyone.
[03:37:20.896 --> 03:37:28.142]  And so they sold a lot of hawks in our government that, yeah, we're staging attacks, and yeah, we're attacking countries, but it's for America.
[03:37:28.960 --> 03:37:34.524]  And now those deluded hawks that believe that, and I'm going, wait a minute, this isn't even for America, or for my grandkids.
[03:37:34.524 --> 03:37:39.006]  Because, you know, the argument of, well, if we're not evil, somebody else will do these tricks, and they'll be in control.
[03:37:39.006 --> 03:37:41.448]  We've got to guard goodness with pure evil.
[03:37:41.448 --> 03:37:44.109]  You know, kind of like guard the truth, the bodyguard of lies.
[03:37:44.109 --> 03:37:45.710]  You know, so there's that rationalization.
[03:37:45.710 --> 03:37:52.354]  I think they're now figuring out, my God, this is totally nihilistic, and this isn't even what I signed up for.
[03:37:52.354 --> 03:37:57.097]  These people are really going to, you know, this isn't, I mean, do you see the point I'm making?
[03:37:57.097 --> 03:37:58.458]  Yes, I think that's happening.
[03:37:59.764 --> 03:38:00.624]  Yes, I do.
[03:38:00.624 --> 03:38:04.766]  Also, Andrew Jackson, I think, was on the right side in the banking issue.
[03:38:04.766 --> 03:38:09.468]  He was the one who got rid of the power of the Second Bank of the United States.
[03:38:09.468 --> 03:38:12.709]  Exactly, and he was fighting with Native Americans when it would be 5-1, 10-1, 15-1 against the U.S.
[03:38:12.709 --> 03:38:13.929]  forces when it was real wars.
[03:38:19.692 --> 03:38:42.630]  And when they were being overrun and beaten so it was it was a thing of and you know hiring one native group to attack the other but now it can be seen as oh my god he was engaging in genocide when it was really life-and-death struggle between you know Ice Age man and you know Ice Age Asians that had come over into North America and then into Mesoamerica and I'm not I mean I mean we could certainly in hindsight look at what happened
[03:38:42.990 --> 03:38:47.653]  But you know, the Hollywood image is the 1880s, the final extermination, the final tracking down.
[03:38:47.653 --> 03:38:48.653]  I think that's wrong.
[03:38:48.653 --> 03:38:56.077]  But we can see where the eugenics idea then comes out of that, and now it's just being used as a tool of statecraft and mind control.
[03:38:56.077 --> 03:38:57.598]  But I digress.
[03:38:57.598 --> 03:39:00.540]  Let's take some calls here.
[03:39:00.540 --> 03:39:05.642]  Let's go ahead and talk to, first up, Lance in Montana.
[03:39:05.642 --> 03:39:06.903]  Lance, you're on the air.
[03:39:06.903 --> 03:39:07.843]  Go ahead.
[03:39:07.843 --> 03:39:10.285]  Yeah, I just have one quick question for Mr. Cook.
[03:39:11.455 --> 03:39:15.837]  What would you suggest to people that have 401ks and retirement accounts?
[03:39:15.837 --> 03:39:19.458]  Would you suggest that they pull them out, or let them ride?
[03:39:19.458 --> 03:39:26.620]  Well, let me say, first of all, I'm not a licensed financial counselor, so I can't give individual advice.
[03:39:26.620 --> 03:39:30.502]  A lot of people write to me about that.
[03:39:30.502 --> 03:39:35.683]  I think you should just do your own analysis, and you should base it on a worst-case scenario.
[03:39:35.683 --> 03:39:39.925]  Now, of course, they're floating the stock market, and the reason they're floating the stock market is because
[03:39:40.410 --> 03:39:46.673]  The financiers have so much money in it and so much of the money in the stock market rides on investments in China.
[03:39:46.673 --> 03:39:51.695]  That's a huge part of what is keeping the stock market over the $12,000 level.
[03:39:51.695 --> 03:39:56.837]  It's because the American people can't buy that stuff and can't pay for it.
[03:39:56.837 --> 03:40:03.820]  So as far as what your investments are concerned, all I can say is get a good counselor, take a worst-case scenario, and go from there.
[03:40:03.820 --> 03:40:04.220]  Okay.
[03:40:04.220 --> 03:40:04.760]  Thank you much.
[03:40:05.407 --> 03:40:06.028]  Absolutely.
[03:40:06.028 --> 03:40:10.473]  Yeah, get out of debt, have storable food, try to have a place to boogie out to.
[03:40:10.473 --> 03:40:21.166]  I mean, even five acres, a hundred miles outside your town, away from anybody, if you've got to, you know, with an RV and supplies, you know, in case there's riots and total breakdown.
[03:40:21.166 --> 03:40:22.828]  And I'm not saying that's going to happen.
[03:40:23.368 --> 03:40:37.331]  But if there's a meltdown, it is a very good chance that's going to happen, where they, by design, let things break down for months, sometimes even longer, so people beg to be reorganized.
[03:40:37.331 --> 03:40:38.712]  Can you comment on that, Mr. Cook?
[03:40:38.712 --> 03:40:49.974]  Well, I'm going to, in my article that's coming out the next day or two, make a series of suggestions to people once we run through all of the macro solutions about what people should do individually.
[03:40:49.974 --> 03:40:52.855]  First thing I put in there is plant a robust home garden.
[03:40:54.844 --> 03:40:56.665]  Take care of your food supply.
[03:40:56.665 --> 03:40:57.045]  God help us.
[03:40:57.045 --> 03:40:58.765]  Start community food co-ops.
[03:40:58.765 --> 03:41:02.387]  Establish local currencies and barter networks.
[03:41:02.387 --> 03:41:03.887]  Get out of debt.
[03:41:03.887 --> 03:41:05.428]  Become politically active.
[03:41:05.428 --> 03:41:11.050]  Do things that you can do right now to take care of your own needs and those of your family.
[03:41:11.050 --> 03:41:13.051]  Don't worry about the big macroeconomy.
[03:41:13.051 --> 03:41:14.211]  I mean, work for change.
[03:41:14.211 --> 03:41:19.473]  Try to get politicians in there who will listen to you, but people have also got to take care of their food supply.
[03:41:20.604 --> 03:41:28.350]  And, you know, if the police are ordered to go door-to-door and take guns, as they admittedly are training to do, cops just don't follow the order.
[03:41:28.350 --> 03:41:30.552]  You know, you don't have to even get in a big fight and argue about it.
[03:41:30.552 --> 03:41:32.553]  Just say you strained your ankle.
[03:41:32.553 --> 03:41:34.675]  Just don't show up.
[03:41:34.675 --> 03:41:38.398]  Because I just can't believe they're training for it.
[03:41:38.398 --> 03:41:41.060]  I just can't believe they're doing this to us.
[03:41:41.060 --> 03:41:44.482]  Who's up next from Georgia?
[03:41:44.482 --> 03:41:46.044]  Thyrus in Georgia, you're on the air.
[03:41:46.044 --> 03:41:49.066]  Go ahead.
[03:41:49.066 --> 03:41:49.206]  Hello?
[03:41:50.134 --> 03:41:51.675]  Yes sir, you're on the air.
[03:41:51.675 --> 03:41:59.842]  Okay, one thing that I've noticed is that with the rising fuel cost, people have a lot less ability to get around, to move around.
[03:41:59.842 --> 03:42:08.649]  And, I mean, that seems to be one of the, maybe, not necessarily the primary goal, because it seems like we're marching really steadily towards Marshall Law.
[03:42:08.649 --> 03:42:12.232]  But the frightening thing is, I mean, does it seem likely that the whole
[03:42:12.904 --> 03:42:14.745]  No, that's what I've always been saying.
[03:42:14.745 --> 03:42:16.966]  We can't get focused on the puppet personality.
[03:42:16.966 --> 03:42:19.388]  This is an agenda and all these politicians are on the surface
[03:42:32.069 --> 03:42:34.112]  Is a simulation.
[03:42:34.112 --> 03:42:35.595]  Bush is like birdcage liner.
[03:42:35.595 --> 03:42:36.616]  He takes all the blame.
[03:42:36.616 --> 03:42:39.460]  He's wicked and horrible and a little demon.
[03:42:39.460 --> 03:42:46.090]  I mean how dare them put out all these details of Spitzer's sexual habits while Bush is packing in gay prostitutes 24-7.
[03:42:47.131 --> 03:42:50.094]  I mean, it's just so horrible.
[03:42:50.094 --> 03:43:02.163]  Again, they know how to tantalize us and get us obsessed with looking at these puppets while, yes, it was all about suppressing you when they took everything you had.
[03:43:02.163 --> 03:43:03.665]  How many years have I been saying that?
[03:43:03.665 --> 03:43:04.585]  Mr. Cook?
[03:43:04.585 --> 03:43:13.813]  I think, too, that you've got to realize that the United States has deliberately been made dependent upon gasoline and petroleum.
[03:43:14.377 --> 03:43:38.587]  I mean, if you go back to all of the decisions that have been made since, uh, really the 1960s, where we were going to rely on the automobile, we were just going to build highways, we weren't going to bother with mass transit, uh, we were going to build all of these big suburbs, uh, spread out all over the landscape, we were going to build shopping malls and big box stores where you can't even walk from one place to another, all you can do is drive.
[03:43:38.587 --> 03:43:44.129]  They've created the situation where all they had to do was raise the price of gasoline
[03:43:44.617 --> 03:43:47.379]  And this economy would come to a standstill.
[03:43:47.379 --> 03:44:02.469]  Now, you've got to obviously get around today, but you've also got to demand of the people in charge that you create an economy that is not totally susceptible to this kind of a chokehold, this kind of a breakdown.
[03:44:02.469 --> 03:44:04.170]  I want to go back to what you just said.
[03:44:04.170 --> 03:44:05.691]  I want to go back, because I never heard you say that.
[03:44:05.691 --> 03:44:07.192]  That's exactly what I say on air.
[03:44:07.192 --> 03:44:09.974]  You can just objectively look at what they're doing, and of course they've bragged about it.
[03:44:11.232 --> 03:44:12.933]  This is all systematic.
[03:44:12.933 --> 03:44:15.434]  They designed everything to be based on the automobile.
[03:44:15.434 --> 03:44:19.917]  They paid billions to make sure there wasn't mass transit, and I'm not even particularly defending that.
[03:44:19.917 --> 03:44:38.087]  The point is, everything in globalism is to make countries and individuals totally independent, I mean totally dependent, in a prison-like panoptagon, and to make the globalists who are international exempt from all their rules at the national level, where countries are nothing but individual prison grids,
[03:44:38.787 --> 03:44:42.652]  And then they are outside the prison grids with diplomatic immunity.
[03:44:42.652 --> 03:44:54.345]  And they've now reported that police in California, 996,000 employees of the government, are all above the law, no DWIs, no arrests, no speeding.
[03:44:54.345 --> 03:44:57.849]  I mean, and that's what the late Aaron Russo said that Nick Rockefeller told him.
[03:44:58.349 --> 03:45:02.550]  He said, look, we're going to have an ID card, and we're going to be above the law, and you're not.
[03:45:02.550 --> 03:45:03.110]  And that's it.
[03:45:03.110 --> 03:45:10.711]  Diplomatic globalists, people bowing down, kissing their butts, and we're all just slaves locked down in our countries.
[03:45:10.711 --> 03:45:11.471]  Mr. Cook?
[03:45:11.471 --> 03:45:21.093]  Now, I think that, again, I'm looking at it from the point of view of my specialty, and that is that it all goes back to control of money.
[03:45:21.093 --> 03:45:24.974]  And the control of money that they rely on, and the ability to produce debt,
[03:45:25.538 --> 03:45:44.455]  Is all based upon what we call the privately controlled fractional reserve banking system, where the banks have the ability to simply make up credit, create money out of thin air, and then lend it to you and put you into debt to pay them back by your labor that's extended over your lifetime.
[03:45:44.455 --> 03:45:47.318]  And again, that's another factor that has to be changed.
[03:45:47.318 --> 03:45:48.239]  Anything else, Cyrus?
[03:45:49.286 --> 03:45:50.028]  Yeah, one more thing.
[03:45:50.028 --> 03:45:57.528]  I mean, I've heard rumors about, you know, how it's possible that this legislation is trying to bring about some sort of, you know, their belief of Armageddon or whatever.
[03:45:59.261 --> 03:46:00.962]  Listen, listen, that's a front.
[03:46:00.962 --> 03:46:11.406]  They act like they're evangelicals, they act like, and they manipulate, you know, the poor, you know, right-wing Christians who aren't even really right-wing to think that open borders, gun control is conservative.
[03:46:11.406 --> 03:46:18.228]  I mean, when you get down to it, they're into occultism, they're into New Age, they're mainly in the Republican Guild.
[03:46:18.228 --> 03:46:25.951]  It's like a club, it's like a homosexual guild, and that's kind of a rite of passage into their gang.
[03:46:25.951 --> 03:46:27.212]  Actually, a lot of gangs are like that.
[03:46:27.632 --> 03:46:31.733]  Well, I think that there's a lot of this secrecy and a lot of this
[03:46:52.741 --> 03:46:56.244]  Clubbism, if you will, that certainly is going on.
[03:46:56.244 --> 03:47:06.212]  But again, from my point of view, we've got to realize that it rests upon their ability to control money and their ability to create money out of the banking system.
[03:47:06.212 --> 03:47:10.796]  You take that away, how many of these people could go to work and earn an honest living?
[03:47:10.796 --> 03:47:17.561]  Well, not very many of them could, because they're living as parasites off of the producing system.
[03:47:17.561 --> 03:47:21.865]  We have to take back the whole system of credit creation
[03:47:22.498 --> 03:47:26.629]  And bring that back into the control of our elected democracy.
[03:47:26.629 --> 03:47:28.595]  Well, I want to be clear though about this in our republic.
[03:47:29.574 --> 03:47:36.758]  Is that it's killing the goose that lays the golden eggs, but they're so greedy they don't even want that goose to have a life.
[03:47:36.758 --> 03:47:44.063]  They'd rather have a dead goose and have the only golden eggs that were laid than have golden eggs laid that somebody else might get their hands on.
[03:47:44.063 --> 03:47:51.147]  It is a total religion of control freak behavior where they don't care if we all live in slums and are being euthanized.
[03:47:51.147 --> 03:47:52.468]  They don't care if we're starving to death.
[03:47:52.768 --> 03:47:59.398]  As long as they're in armored citadels with guys in black uniforms following their orders, it's about having total control.
[03:47:59.398 --> 03:48:03.765]  Because psychopaths gravitate towards law enforcement, politics, and power.
[03:48:04.543 --> 03:48:08.244]  Normal people get a modicum of power and then aren't hungry anymore.
[03:48:08.244 --> 03:48:11.784]  It's only the mentally ill that crave control and domination.
[03:48:11.784 --> 03:48:21.927]  That's why Stalin, Hitler, and others, when they had unlimited power, went crazy and started killing everybody because it's part of the pathological extremism.
[03:48:21.927 --> 03:48:24.107]  Mr. Cook, you want to comment on that statement?
[03:48:24.107 --> 03:48:33.329]  Well, I think that's so, but again, it's my own view that we have to understand what to put into place to replace all of that.
[03:48:34.761 --> 03:48:38.706]  You can't fight something unless you have knowledge of what it should be like.
[03:48:38.706 --> 03:48:53.023]  And so, again, going back to the fractional reserve banking system, in the monetary reform movement, we believe that the government should be the ones who are lending to the banks, and that we should be, as a people,
[03:48:53.775 --> 03:48:59.339]  Uh, the beneficiaries of the proceeds of that type of lending and then use that to pay for legitimate government expenditures.
[03:49:23.615 --> 03:49:24.395]  You should use it.
[03:49:24.395 --> 03:49:33.798]  Yeah, and let me just put a figure out there, which is one that I'm going to put out on Global Research when this article comes out in the next day or two.
[03:49:33.798 --> 03:49:52.084]  My own estimate is that if we could implement these kind of reforms, we could eliminate three-fourths or more of the current tax burden that our economy is subject to, and that we could by taking control of currency issuance, by taking control of
[03:49:52.814 --> 03:49:56.036]  Uh, the ability to create a national dividend.
[03:49:56.036 --> 03:50:01.298]  We can get rid of the 16th Amendment to the Constitution and the direct income tax altogether.
[03:50:01.298 --> 03:50:18.187]  Uh, there's one other thing that I want to mention that we can do right now that would take away a lot of the power of the financial manipulators, and that would be to outlaw all leveraged banking based upon speculation.
[03:50:19.111 --> 03:50:21.693]  Absolutely, and there's all sorts of ways they do that.
[03:50:21.693 --> 03:50:24.415]  We'll have you back soon to break down some of those specifics.
[03:50:24.415 --> 03:50:26.477]  I agree with that recommendation as well.
[03:50:26.477 --> 03:50:31.441]  For internet listeners of the InfoWars.com streams, you need to go there right now.
[03:50:31.441 --> 03:50:32.902]  We're going to do this three-minute break.
[03:50:32.902 --> 03:50:41.949]  We're going to do an interview right now because this is so important, and then we're going to come back and talk to Dan in Texas and Phoenix and Atlanta, maybe a few more.
[03:50:41.949 --> 03:50:46.233]  Alright, interview continues at InfoWars.com.
[03:50:46.233 --> 03:50:47.534]  It is a big idea
[03:50:48.672 --> 03:50:50.454]  A new world order.
[03:50:50.454 --> 03:50:54.959]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[03:50:54.959 --> 03:50:58.182]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[03:50:58.182 --> 03:51:00.385]  Don't their objective be world domination?
[03:51:00.967 --> 03:51:04.148]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:51:04.148 --> 03:51:14.491]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:51:14.491 --> 03:51:19.453]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[03:51:19.933 --> 03:51:23.815]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[03:51:23.815 --> 03:51:26.377]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[03:51:26.377 --> 03:51:27.537]  Most people have no idea.
[03:51:27.537 --> 03:51:28.318]  They're not after money.
[03:51:28.318 --> 03:51:29.599]  They have all the money they need.
[03:51:29.599 --> 03:51:30.579]  They're after power.
[03:51:30.579 --> 03:51:31.720]  That's what I have to do, sir.
[03:51:31.720 --> 03:51:36.482]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[03:51:43.246 --> 03:51:44.407]  You have been warned.
[03:51:45.083 --> 03:51:50.926]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[03:51:50.926 --> 03:51:56.350]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[03:51:56.350 --> 03:52:01.733]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[03:52:01.733 --> 03:52:07.636]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and loss of weight.
[03:52:07.636 --> 03:52:11.919]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life,
[03:52:12.119 --> 03:52:13.861]  Most people are overly acidic.
[03:52:13.861 --> 03:52:17.644]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[03:52:17.644 --> 03:52:22.469]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[03:52:22.469 --> 03:52:23.510]  Do your part.
[03:52:23.510 --> 03:52:26.132]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now!

[03:52:47.693 --> 03:52:49.234]  Loose Change Final Cut.
[03:52:49.234 --> 03:52:51.396]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[03:52:51.396 --> 03:52:53.298]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[03:52:53.298 --> 03:52:54.779]  The late great USA.
[03:52:54.779 --> 03:52:56.561]  America, freedom to fascism.
[03:52:56.561 --> 03:53:03.587]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available at truthnews.us and prisonplanet.com.

[03:53:51.900 --> 03:53:53.221]  The criminals are scared.
[03:53:53.221 --> 03:53:57.865]  They know they've raped you hard and the real raping is about to begin.
[03:53:57.865 --> 03:53:59.607]  They don't want you to fight back.
[03:53:59.607 --> 03:54:02.790]  Homeland Security is going to tie you down so they can do it.
[03:54:02.790 --> 03:54:04.872]  Are you going to go along with it?
[03:54:04.872 --> 03:54:08.255]  And are our police in history going to be known as Nazis?
[03:54:08.255 --> 03:54:09.015]  As Soviets?
[03:54:09.015 --> 03:54:10.357]  As scum?
[03:54:10.357 --> 03:54:13.860]  Or will you join us and not go along with this criminality?
[03:54:13.860 --> 03:54:16.963]  RichardCCook.com works in the Carter White House.
[03:54:17.933 --> 03:54:19.794]  Go ahead, you're on the air, Dan.
[03:54:19.794 --> 03:54:21.595]  Alright, yeah, I was calling in.
[03:54:21.595 --> 03:54:22.575]  Basically, I'm a fan of Mr. Cook.
[03:54:22.575 --> 03:54:25.017]  I saw the Challenger Revealed book up here.
[03:54:25.017 --> 03:54:26.818]  It looks like a great read.
[03:54:26.818 --> 03:54:34.221]  My question for Mr. Cook is, basically, what do you think, as far as the economy, we do about slimeballs,
[03:54:49.794 --> 03:55:01.123]  Listen, I appreciate you calling, sir.
[03:55:01.123 --> 03:55:04.365]  You can call me back when I'm just taking calls and we can do that.
[03:55:04.365 --> 03:55:07.108]  What do you do about slime balls and make money?
[03:55:07.108 --> 03:55:12.132]  Obviously, I need to make money to be able to defend ourselves, sue people that slander us,
[03:55:12.492 --> 03:55:13.873]  People can't go to your website?
[03:55:31.812 --> 03:55:32.714]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:55:32.714 --> 03:55:34.236]  Please go to InfoWars.com.
[03:55:34.236 --> 03:55:36.199]  In fact, listen, I appreciate your call.
[03:55:36.199 --> 03:55:38.423]  I'm going to say this to you, Dan.
[03:55:38.423 --> 03:55:40.546]  In fact, I didn't plug the videos today.
[03:55:40.546 --> 03:55:41.488]  I should have.
[03:55:41.488 --> 03:55:42.770]  I'm going to take time out right now.
[03:55:42.770 --> 03:55:44.573]  I don't want to cut into Mr. Cook's time.
[03:55:44.573 --> 03:55:45.955]  Actually, we need more capital.
[03:55:46.728 --> 03:55:51.629]  People would think we just need to work from a ditch with a tin can and a string here.
[03:55:51.629 --> 03:55:53.450]  I don't plug my videos enough.
[03:55:53.450 --> 03:55:55.250]  Buy all the books and videos we have.
[03:55:55.250 --> 03:55:57.051]  Give us donations if you'd like.
[03:55:57.051 --> 03:55:57.611]  Support us.
[03:55:57.611 --> 03:56:03.413]  I want to get a bigger office, hire more people, do more stories, support more activist groups.
[03:56:03.413 --> 03:56:05.813]  The asinine statement.
[03:56:05.813 --> 03:56:08.614]  I mean, I bring on all these other activist groups and tell you to support them.
[03:56:09.284 --> 03:56:10.826]  When I'm not getting any gain from it.
[03:56:10.826 --> 03:56:12.328]  This is about survival.
[03:56:12.328 --> 03:56:13.409]  Let me give you a tip, sir.
[03:56:13.409 --> 03:56:17.294]  I didn't do nine hours of radio yesterday because I want dirty money.
[03:56:17.294 --> 03:56:20.437]  I'm trying to tell my wife we're not evacuating the country.
[03:56:20.437 --> 03:56:24.182]  I'm trying to face my possible imprisonment or death.
[03:56:24.182 --> 03:56:25.844]  I'm living in the real world.
[03:56:26.514 --> 03:56:30.476]  And then you say, what do you do about scumbags that profit from 9-11?
[03:56:30.476 --> 03:56:32.756]  How dare you imply we were involved in the attacks?
[03:56:32.756 --> 03:56:34.117]  How dare you imply?
[03:56:34.117 --> 03:56:38.799]  We're here risking our lives, our names, being death-threatened to make films we put out for free.
[03:56:38.799 --> 03:56:42.460]  But yes, Loose Change Final Cut has still not made its money back.
[03:56:42.460 --> 03:56:44.741]  The people that made it are almost homeless.
[03:56:44.741 --> 03:56:48.803]  Please buy Loose Change Final Cut from us immediately to support us.
[03:56:48.803 --> 03:56:49.703]  Mr. Cook, I'm sorry to
[03:56:50.083 --> 03:56:50.863]  Run over your time.
[03:56:50.863 --> 03:56:55.124]  In fact, we'll go ten minutes into overdrive now to be able to answer people's questions.
[03:56:55.124 --> 03:56:57.285]  But, you know, the mainstream media says that all the time.
[03:56:57.285 --> 03:56:59.886]  Ooh, you sell videos saying the government's bad.
[03:56:59.886 --> 03:57:04.487]  You're not allowed to make a living and survive having your political view.
[03:57:04.487 --> 03:57:05.787]  Everybody else can.
[03:57:05.787 --> 03:57:07.328]  Bill O'Reilly can.
[03:57:07.328 --> 03:57:08.928]  All these news anchors can.
[03:57:08.928 --> 03:57:10.609]  The Carlisle Group can.
[03:57:10.609 --> 03:57:15.870]  I'm not out with a government with taxes forcing people to give money to me, Mr. Cook.
[03:57:15.870 --> 03:57:17.611]  I mean, how do they say I'm bad?
[03:57:17.611 --> 03:57:18.791]  That's our enemy's argument.
[03:57:19.625 --> 03:57:35.973]  Well, you know, a lot of these people are being paid by loans that the government has to sell to China because we can't afford to pay our own way in this country, so... Oh, and they admit they have thousands of fake CENTCOM people calling in and blogging, but I don't think that's one of these people.
[03:57:35.973 --> 03:57:36.773]  They're jealous.
[03:57:36.773 --> 03:57:42.676]  A lot of people in our movement are jealous of anyone that actually hires an employee, starts an operation.
[03:57:42.676 --> 03:57:43.496]  Stay there, Mr. Cook.
[03:57:43.496 --> 03:57:46.518]  I want to, if you can, do ten more minutes in super overdrive.
[03:57:46.838 --> 03:57:48.739]  We're going to leave the Genesis Network now.
[03:57:48.739 --> 03:57:58.443]  We're going to do 10 minutes in super overdrive on the internet streams where tens of thousands of you are listening right now and PrisonPlanet.tv for viewers.
[03:57:58.443 --> 03:58:04.725]  If you want to hear that, you've got to get off the Genesis Stream and others and go over to InfoWars.com or if you're a PrisonPlanet.tv member.
[03:58:04.725 --> 03:58:07.046]  But don't let those enemies stop us.
[03:58:07.046 --> 03:58:08.987]  I should have plugged my videos earlier.
[03:58:08.987 --> 03:58:10.208]  InfoWars.com.
[03:58:10.208 --> 03:58:11.628]  Buy them on DVD.
[03:58:11.628 --> 03:58:13.489]  Defeat that enemy, Dan.
[03:58:14.153 --> 03:58:16.835]  We'll be right back with Phoenix and others.
[03:58:16.835 --> 03:58:26.200]  Stay with us.
[03:58:26.200 --> 03:58:27.761]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:58:27.761 --> 03:58:31.363]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:58:35.714 --> 03:58:38.957]  The election cycle draws near, and we don't have much time left.
[03:58:38.957 --> 03:58:45.863]  If the American people truly hope to make a change in Washington, then we must act now with a cohesive plan for taking back our government.
[03:58:45.863 --> 03:58:50.247]  Washington You're Fired is a new patriotic documentary from the director of Beyond Treason.
[03:58:50.247 --> 03:58:54.811]  The video is the result of a two-year endeavor to assemble a video tool for engaging
[03:58:55.151 --> 03:58:59.633]  Educating and motivating the American people to climb back into the driver's seat of Congress.
[03:58:59.633 --> 03:59:07.676]  Washington You're Fired lays out the last seven years of fundamentally flawed terror-related spy bills in a linear fashion that no one has ever constructed before.
[03:59:07.676 --> 03:59:12.477]  The resulting shift in our governmental power structure leaves the American people with only two choices.
[03:59:12.477 --> 03:59:15.378]  Be a part of the problem or be a part of the solution.
[03:59:15.378 --> 03:59:22.661]  Washington You're Fired is being described as the best patriotic video since Freedom to Fascism and we want you to get a copy and share it with your friends.
[03:59:23.221 --> 03:59:24.902]  We invite you to make the change.
[03:59:24.902 --> 03:59:26.763]  Help take back our government now.
[03:59:26.763 --> 03:59:31.026]  Go to TakeBackWashington.com and get the tools you need for the information war.
[03:59:31.026 --> 03:59:32.947]  We have a plan to take back our government.
[03:59:32.947 --> 03:59:38.491]  Visit TakeBackWashington.com.
[03:59:38.491 --> 03:59:45.475]  This is the GCN Radio Network, home to hard-hitting talk radio.
[03:59:45.475 --> 03:59:46.996]  Eugenics dominate in the 20th century.
