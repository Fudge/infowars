[00:00.000 --> 00:02.060]  you
[00:30.000 --> 00:32.060]  you
[01:00.000 --> 01:02.000]  you
[01:30.720 --> 01:32.720]  you
[01:33.080 --> 01:37.880]  Live from the info wars.com studios. It's Alex Jones
[01:41.760 --> 01:44.960]  Wow a packed show today
[01:45.480 --> 01:53.000]  Owen shroyer David Knight filling in for Alex Jones, and I'm just gonna lay out everything that we've got planned for you today
[01:53.000 --> 01:58.580]  On the Alex Jones show absolutely stocked full. We've got the Democrats. Oh for
[01:58.580 --> 02:06.420]  2017 another loss last night a very expensive loss for the Democrats. How embarrassing we've got World War three building with Russia
[02:06.980 --> 02:12.500]  Coming out of Syria. We've got a J. Johnson hearing today more bombshells out of that funny
[02:12.500 --> 02:14.020]  I didn't hear any build up to that
[02:14.020 --> 02:20.380]  I didn't see the media of fawning over the J. Johnson hearing wonder why that was we've got of course North Korea
[02:20.460 --> 02:25.500]  Tensions building there the media making fun of auto warm beer who is now deceased may he rest in peace
[02:25.500 --> 02:31.860]  We've got developments on the real collusion between Comey the Clintons Loretta Lynch shoes and rise that's developing
[02:31.860 --> 02:38.140]  And then we're gonna have Gary Haven and Joe Biggs joining us to talk about UN sex trafficking in Haiti
[02:38.140 --> 02:43.340]  And of course Alex Jones will be joining us as well. I now bring in my tag team partner David Knight
[02:43.340 --> 02:48.180]  I know that you have a slew of stories that you want to get to as well. Yeah, you know, it's pretty amazing when we look at
[02:48.620 --> 02:50.740]  this referendum on Trump
[02:50.740 --> 02:56.300]  Oh, and one of the best comments I saw was Kellyanne Conway tweeting out
[02:56.300 --> 02:58.800]  I'm laughing my ass off and
[02:59.340 --> 03:04.940]  They have to be laughing because we've seen increasingly saying that they're going to have a referendum on Trump
[03:04.940 --> 03:10.580]  This is every one of these special elections is going to be that and I actually saw Reuters saying well
[03:10.580 --> 03:15.980]  These margins are getting smaller and smaller. So that means that the Democrats are getting momentum and it's like
[03:15.980 --> 03:20.380]  Yeah, that's the most desperate spin. I've seen yet. That's what Robert
[03:20.820 --> 03:24.020]  Rike the fourth tweeted out as well a professor at Berkeley
[03:24.020 --> 03:28.860]  And I was just like what a delusional thought from a very delusional person on delusional Island
[03:29.020 --> 03:33.900]  Thinking that this loss is somehow a victory for you. So the Democrats continue to lose
[03:33.980 --> 03:41.180]  You've got leftist media that wants to make fun of Otto Warmbier calling him a white American frat boy
[03:41.180 --> 03:47.420]  He deserves what he gets. Well, he's dead now. You've got the media going full Isis with CNN and
[03:47.700 --> 03:49.260]  Kathy Griffin and then
[03:49.260 --> 03:52.420]  Representative Scalise gets shot no responsibility there
[03:52.420 --> 03:58.660]  But then you've got I believe her name was Michelle Carter who is responsible now being held responsible for her boyfriend's suicide
[03:59.380 --> 04:04.500]  Because apparently a tweet or apparently a message that she sends him causes him to commit suicide
[04:05.020 --> 04:08.700]  Well, if you're gonna use that precedent, which I completely disagree with in that case
[04:08.700 --> 04:16.140]  How can you not use that precedent against media that is encouraging violence against Trump encouraging violence against Trump supporters?
[04:16.140 --> 04:22.500]  And we continue to see this go on and on and then during this hearing David
[04:22.820 --> 04:26.780]  I'm quoting Jay Johnson. They're talking about fake news
[04:26.780 --> 04:30.020]  We're gonna have more clips from Jay Johnson Alex Jones coming up on the other side of this break
[04:30.180 --> 04:34.220]  But Jay Johnson during the hearing today talking about fake news
[04:34.220 --> 04:39.260]  Says people have little and I'm quoting here. I don't know the exact quote
[04:39.260 --> 04:44.820]  But people have little or no recourse for social media posts. He's talking about fake news there
[04:44.860 --> 04:48.500]  Well, what about all the people calling for the assassination of Trump?
[04:49.180 --> 04:53.380]  Little or no recourse on that. Can you believe that double standard David?
[04:53.380 --> 04:56.460]  Let's talk about the fake news because when he opened up his statement. He said in
[04:57.940 --> 05:03.180]  2016 at the direction of the Russian government at the direction of Russian president Vladimir Putin himself
[05:03.180 --> 05:07.980]  They're orchestrated cyber attacks on our nation for the purpose of influencing our election
[05:07.980 --> 05:14.460]  He doesn't we have that clip too. Go ahead know that he doesn't they don't have and of course when I talked to John McAfee
[05:14.460 --> 05:17.200]  He pointed out he said that this would be the most incompetent
[05:18.020 --> 05:21.380]  Spycraft ever if they left fingerprints all over this
[05:21.380 --> 05:25.900]  He said you can't tell where these things are routed from and they have ways of
[05:26.340 --> 05:31.700]  Disguising this and then subsequent to that we had the WikiLeaks vault seven releases that showed the owners
[05:31.700 --> 05:38.220]  The owners manuals the operating manuals of how they would mask things even making the keystrokes
[05:38.220 --> 05:40.720]  Look as if they're coming from Russia and yet we hear that
[05:41.220 --> 05:44.340]  They are saying this has all happened and we know that it happened
[05:44.340 --> 05:50.300]  You know what we know is we know that the Department of Homeland Security Jay Johnson the guy who is
[05:50.660 --> 05:56.980]  Testifying today in the house the Department of Homeland Security are the ones who hacked into state boards of elections
[05:56.980 --> 06:04.700]  This is the issue everywhere. They're trying to cover themselves with a Russian red herring when they are the ones who broke the law
[06:04.700 --> 06:12.060]  And we got something else coming up about obstruction of justice and trying to take these unmasking documents and hide them in the Obama library
[06:12.060 --> 06:19.380]  We write back with Alex Jones. I say abolish the DHS and the CIA immediately based on what we know about those two departments
[06:19.380 --> 06:21.380]  We've got those clips on the other side
[06:21.380 --> 06:28.740]  Leftists in Europe carried out 27 terror attacks in 2016 which debunks the claim that conservatives and libertarians represent a bigger
[06:28.780 --> 06:35.540]  Extremist threat over 140 terrorist attacks occurred in Europe last year and 27 of them were blamed on leftists in comparison
[06:35.540 --> 06:42.060]  Just one right-wing terror attack was recorded for the entire year 13 attacks were blamed on jihadis while the majority of the attacks nearly
[06:42.060 --> 06:50.060]  100 were by separatist movements terrorist attacks, which led to deaths and injuries are almost exclusively Islamic and gets who advocates open
[06:50.060 --> 06:55.580]  Borders and radical Islam is select the statistics this proved the narrative that conservatives and libertarians
[06:55.900 --> 07:01.500]  Represent a major terrorist threat a claim the major media was pushing after the recent attack on Muslims near mosque in London
[07:01.500 --> 07:06.900]  The study came from Europe hole law enforcement agency of the European Union tasked with combating organized crime and terrorism
[07:07.220 --> 07:12.740]  Additionally terror experts in the US are also warning that left-wing terror represents a far bigger concern than ever before
[07:12.900 --> 07:17.300]  Which isn't surprising given how the establishment keeps promoting violence against president Trump
[07:17.300 --> 07:21.500]  You can find out more at info wars.com. This is get Daniels reporting
[07:21.500 --> 07:26.340]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of
[07:26.780 --> 07:32.220]  Seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through mother nature to detoxify the body
[07:32.220 --> 07:38.540]  That's why I'm introducing z shield toxic metal and chemical defense support. It's made in the USA
[07:38.540 --> 07:45.500]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war
[07:45.500 --> 07:51.260]  It is a classical 360 when this is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year
[07:51.260 --> 07:57.540]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get you
[07:57.540 --> 08:02.420]  What's yourself you what's your family and you owe it to the future of this country in the world that?

[08:40.900 --> 08:46.380]  Will you sign up for auto ship because we hold back a surplus for auto ship customers number three?
[08:46.460 --> 08:50.580]  We're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50
[08:50.700 --> 08:54.820]  listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to
[08:54.820 --> 08:58.340]  Reorder the products that you need each month. Just go to info or store calm
[08:58.340 --> 09:04.300]  Select your favorite product or products click on auto ship and choose how often you want us to send you another order

[09:16.900 --> 09:21.160]  And all out of stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto ship
[09:21.160 --> 09:27.720]  The globalist great error is to believe that as they collapse humanity, they end up on top
[09:28.720 --> 09:35.520]  The truth is humanity is coming down fast, but we're miles above them on our journey to hell
[09:37.200 --> 09:41.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[09:43.640 --> 09:47.800]  Say what you want about president Trump, but we've got a lot of money
[09:47.800 --> 09:54.760]  Say what you want about president Trump, but we dodged a bullet when Hillary Rodham Clinton didn't get elected in
[09:55.480 --> 09:59.840]  2016 and we have seen every element of global corruption
[10:00.840 --> 10:03.800]  Come after president Trump and come after the American people
[10:04.560 --> 10:11.720]  We've also seen multinational corporations intelligence agencies the big universities the MSM media
[10:12.280 --> 10:17.000]  Come after free speech and come after info wars.com
[10:17.000 --> 10:19.000]  And why is that?
[10:19.080 --> 10:22.960]  Info wars did not invent Americana or the modern Renaissance
[10:23.240 --> 10:31.360]  We're simply bringing it back and comparing it historically to the type of socialism and corporate cronyism
[10:31.680 --> 10:35.760]  That we have been seeing in the last few decades in Europe of the United States
[10:36.040 --> 10:41.360]  We know socialism and communism leads to total collapse like we've seen in Venezuela
[10:41.680 --> 10:45.440]  North Korea the old Soviet Union and so many other examples
[10:45.440 --> 10:49.880]  But the modern model of socialism has been disastrous as well
[10:50.200 --> 10:57.080]  It is a predatory system that seeks to dumb down the general population and have a tiny elite on top of it
[10:57.200 --> 11:04.320]  That's why some of the richest men in the world like Carlos Slim the kingpin of Mexico and Jeff Bezos of Amazon
[11:04.840 --> 11:12.120]  CIA and the Washington Post are waging war against info wars.com through their media organs and calling for
[11:12.120 --> 11:16.840]  My radio show my TV transmissions and our websites to be shut down
[11:17.280 --> 11:20.240]  Because they don't want you to have a focal point
[11:20.240 --> 11:26.640]  They don't want you or we the people to have a system that will challenge their lives
[11:27.040 --> 11:32.000]  That's why it's more important for all of you as this fourth of July approaches to understand
[11:32.960 --> 11:37.880]  Most of us that are just good decent honest people don't think of ourselves as much. We're just
[11:37.880 --> 11:43.160]  Humble folks who want to live our lives and enjoy a piece of the American pie
[11:43.840 --> 11:49.440]  But the globalists see our independence and see our love of freedom as a threat because they're authoritarians
[11:49.440 --> 11:53.560]  And that's why not just here in America's 245 year history
[11:53.560 --> 12:00.320]  But all over the world elites will never let the little people simply live their lives and be productive
[12:00.600 --> 12:03.360]  They want total control over the population
[12:03.360 --> 12:09.440]  And that's why they're waging war against info wars because they know it is the people's media
[12:09.840 --> 12:12.200]  promoting justice freedom and prosperity
[12:13.000 --> 12:15.040]  transcending race
[12:15.040 --> 12:16.920]  transcending ethnicity
[12:16.920 --> 12:18.680]  transcending even mainline
[12:18.680 --> 12:26.640]  establishment religions and bringing people together around the idea of free association and a free market of ideas that we know in history
[12:26.960 --> 12:29.260]  Has been the developer of all the major
[12:29.260 --> 12:36.500]  Innovations and freedoms. We've seen you are changing the world when you spread the word when you speak out
[12:36.500 --> 12:42.420]  When you call c-span when you go to the front of your church and talk about these issues when you talk to your neighbors
[12:42.420 --> 12:49.460]  When you spread an article or a video or when you produce an article or a video you are independently speaking
[12:50.020 --> 12:57.180]  To the face of this global system and letting it know that you won't submit and also standing up so that others can see your action
[12:57.180 --> 13:00.980]  And that gives them courage. So again, I want to thank you all for your support
[13:00.980 --> 13:02.780]  I want to thank you for your prayers
[13:02.780 --> 13:10.660]  You have changed the world and I want to encourage you to continue to change the world and to accelerate your resistance a great way
[13:10.660 --> 13:16.260]  To do it is to get high quality products at info or store.com at very competitive prices
[13:16.260 --> 13:23.860]  That then help fund this organization that you know is dedicated to fighting tyranny and more importantly has been
[13:23.860 --> 13:31.620]  successful fighting tyranny on every front that's why the enemies coming after us because we're effective because we tell the truth and
[13:31.780 --> 13:39.540]  Because we literally are spreading the light of justice and freedom throughout the darkness that is this global new world order system
[13:40.180 --> 13:43.140]  The United States became the example of freedom worldwide
[13:43.740 --> 13:47.540]  Not because we were perfect but because we delivered on freedom and prosperity
[13:48.180 --> 13:53.220]  Unlike any other country in history and that's why the globalist technocrats are trying to destroy America
[13:53.220 --> 13:56.420]  And that's why they hate info wars and that's why they hate you so much
[13:56.580 --> 14:02.980]  It is so critical this July 4th that we redeclare independence against the globalist and to understand
[14:03.060 --> 14:08.460]  That your support of the info war has already shaken the globalist to their very core
[14:08.660 --> 14:12.580]  That's why this July 4th. We're having some of the biggest sales ever

[15:21.380 --> 15:26.980]  We're talking our non nano zinc incredibly concentrated high powered sunscreen

[15:34.580 --> 15:40.180]  I've personally used in the modern world. We can use good consumerism as a weapon
[15:40.660 --> 15:45.540]  The globalists and the leftists use their boycotts use their money control to manipulate our lives
[15:45.540 --> 15:52.420]  They take our tax money and give it to NBC as stimulus money to then be anti gun anti freedom anti sovereignty
[15:52.580 --> 15:53.540]  It's that simple
[15:53.540 --> 15:58.820]  But if you will shop with the good guys like info war store.com info wars life.com
[15:58.820 --> 16:04.980]  We can continue to build an independent economy system. That's a win-win for everybody that promotes freedom
[16:05.220 --> 16:07.380]  That's why they're so scared of info wars
[16:07.940 --> 16:15.620]  They're scared of you using your independent media freedom and your independent freedom to purchase high quality products that support freedom
[16:15.860 --> 16:21.060]  To overthrow their system by pulling your financing away from the globalist
[16:21.300 --> 16:25.860]  I don't point a gun at you like the IRS and then take your money and give it to globalist causes
[16:25.860 --> 16:30.660]  I just bring a high quality discounted products that you and your family need
[16:31.140 --> 16:38.420]  That then the profits we make in turn are put into expanding info wars operations against the globalist because the stakes are so high
[16:38.900 --> 16:41.860]  So again, thank you all for your support of info wars
[16:41.860 --> 16:48.580]  And I want to encourage you all to recommit as this July 4th approaches to intensify our efforts to defeat the globalist
[16:48.740 --> 16:53.060]  We can do it, but we've got to continue to press the attack and we've got to continue to pray to god
[16:53.060 --> 16:58.180]  So for myself the info wars crew and my family. I want to wish you all a wonderful 4th of july
[16:59.300 --> 17:01.300]  And I want to thank you all for your support
[17:02.740 --> 17:09.940]  info wars store.com that is how you support this broadcast a lot of great specials going right now the democrats face another loss last night
[17:10.100 --> 17:16.260]  Oh for 2017 they built it all up. They spent a record amount of money. The trump referendum is failing david
[17:16.740 --> 17:18.740]  Yeah, you know alex alex said oh
[17:18.740 --> 17:25.780]  And we have this comment this twitter comment from kelly and conway laughing my ossoff because that's the guy who lost
[17:25.940 --> 17:27.940]  He got an amazing amount of money
[17:28.180 --> 17:34.180]  He raised seven times the amount of money as kelly and conway when we look at the amount of money that was in this record
[17:34.820 --> 17:39.940]  Spending for congressional race. I remember 20 25 years ago in our neck of the woods
[17:40.260 --> 17:45.060]  It was about $500,000 that they would spend on a typical congressional race now
[17:45.060 --> 17:51.620]  We're looking at something that's about 25 million dollars. Think about the 2000 elections. We had
[17:52.340 --> 17:54.500]  Al Gore complaining saying that
[17:55.620 --> 18:01.700]  W had bought the election because he'd spent over 100 million dollars and look at what's happened to the presidential election
[18:02.100 --> 18:05.780]  Look at what's happened to the congressional elections. The real story here
[18:06.420 --> 18:11.380]  Is the politicization and the money that is flowing into politics. Why is that?
[18:11.380 --> 18:18.100]  It's because there's so much power over the economy so much power over our lives in washington
[18:18.580 --> 18:20.180]  That is pulling in corruption
[18:20.180 --> 18:25.940]  That's pulling in money and we see that here and yet in spite of all that in spite of the fact that he got nine times
[18:26.260 --> 18:32.500]  As many donors from california as he did donors in georgia between may 29th and may 31st
[18:32.820 --> 18:34.500]  Those reported by the daily caller
[18:34.500 --> 18:37.620]  He's still lost and they have the audacity to say well
[18:37.620 --> 18:41.460]  We're getting closer with each one of these even though we lose. We're getting closer
[18:42.180 --> 18:48.900]  You can't buy this election and that's really what's happening. Even the washington post said this is a huge win
[18:49.300 --> 18:52.420]  For trump. This is an editorial. I don't know how it got through the washington post
[18:52.900 --> 18:55.140]  People are looking at that said if anything this race proves
[18:55.540 --> 18:59.700]  Republicans have no reason to be defensive as a result of obama cares demise
[18:59.780 --> 19:06.820]  It shows republicans have nothing to hide from in the age of trump and it signifies that nothing about the current foe scandal
[19:06.820 --> 19:12.740]  Ridden environment has produced a down draft for republicans and I think when we look at this
[19:13.380 --> 19:16.740]  That's very important and yet they continue oan with this
[19:17.300 --> 19:23.380]  Uh, this russians hack the election narrative. We have these hearing that's going on today with jay johnson
[19:24.180 --> 19:28.100]  They're talking about how the russians were trying to get voter rolls
[19:28.660 --> 19:30.260]  in various states
[19:30.260 --> 19:33.860]  Well, that's not proven and we know from the releases of
[19:33.860 --> 19:36.420]  wiki leaks vault seven. We know that
[19:36.980 --> 19:42.660]  Intelligence community the cia had tools to make it look like they could be any state actor that they wanted to be
[19:42.740 --> 19:46.260]  They could put the fingerprints the keyboard strokes and so forth to disguise themselves
[19:46.660 --> 19:48.260]  What we do know
[19:48.260 --> 19:53.780]  Is that the first reported hacking of these state boards of elections was in georgia?
[19:54.020 --> 20:02.340]  We just had the election and it was uh jason chafeitz and senator jody heist both of uh, he was from georgia and and uh
[20:02.340 --> 20:09.220]  Uh, chafeitz is from utah. They sent a letter to jay johnson the department of homeland security after the election said
[20:09.700 --> 20:11.060]  Why did this happen?
[20:11.060 --> 20:16.980]  What are you doing about this? Are you investigating this and we question your ability to honestly investigate yourself?
[20:17.380 --> 20:23.780]  They said we question the department's ability to remain neutral in investigating its own potential misconduct and violating the law would add
[20:24.260 --> 20:27.060]  And think an independent investigation of these incidents is warranted
[20:27.060 --> 20:34.660]  They want roth to investigate whether or not the dhs conducted an unauthorized scan of the georgia secretary of states computer networks
[20:35.060 --> 20:41.300]  If so, who authorized the scans has the department conducted unauthorized scans of any other states systems
[20:41.540 --> 20:44.980]  If so, which states did you scan without authorization?
[20:45.620 --> 20:48.660]  And then we found out that was that came out at the beginning of january
[20:48.660 --> 20:52.340]  They got absolutely no response from jay johnson who is testifying today
[20:52.340 --> 20:58.180]  Then we found out in february that they got into indiana's election system as well
[20:58.180 --> 21:00.900]  They traced it back to the department of homeland security
[21:01.380 --> 21:05.300]  1500s 15 000 scans into indiana's
[21:06.020 --> 21:10.100]  Voter registration roles and their election boards. That's the real story
[21:10.100 --> 21:18.420]  They're trying to create a system to hide their crimes trying to insert themselves where they control the elections saying it's critical infrastructure
[21:18.420 --> 21:20.660]  That's what this is about today. We'll be right back
[21:20.660 --> 21:24.260]  Maybe not today. Maybe not tomorrow

[25:15.060 --> 25:22.820]  Get the new book. It's time to align available at amazon.com
[25:34.020 --> 25:36.740]  I think the story with the democrats pretending this
[25:37.540 --> 25:39.540]  narrowing the margin of victory
[25:39.540 --> 25:46.020]  Is a good thing is that they're just going to spend more money. We'll just spend more money and then we'll be even closer next time
[25:46.020 --> 25:51.860]  Of course, that's not going to work and of course presidential race that and this is the party that says they're all about
[25:52.580 --> 25:54.580]  income inequality getting that
[25:54.980 --> 25:58.020]  Income gap, you know figured out they're going to help with that
[25:58.020 --> 26:02.820]  They're going to fix that and then they spend more money on elections than they do the actual people that are poor
[26:03.300 --> 26:05.300]  living in the lower poverty grid
[26:05.300 --> 26:10.900]  But you know, it's funny as you talked about all those uh voter rolls that the dhs
[26:11.540 --> 26:17.620]  Admittedly or the dhs is claiming russia was probing the dhs is the one that actually hacked the elections
[26:17.860 --> 26:20.980]  Yeah, why does vladimir putin want the voter rolls in georgia?
[26:21.140 --> 26:21.940]  Well, and it's funny
[26:21.940 --> 26:25.060]  I can tell you why the obama administration and the democrats would want it
[26:25.060 --> 26:28.660]  Well, and it's funny because he says that he knows putin orchestrated it
[26:28.660 --> 26:34.260]  But then he admits that he can't possibly know that because the dnc isn't cooperating with this investigation to begin with
[26:34.260 --> 26:41.140]  But let's but hold on a second now. Let's recall. Who might have information about the democrat voter rolls
[26:41.380 --> 26:47.300]  Who might have had that information who might have had access to those voter logs and that it department
[26:48.020 --> 26:50.020]  Seth rich, huh?
[26:50.580 --> 26:56.100]  Oh, but he's no longer with us may he rest in peace. So how convenient is that for the dnc that admits?
[26:56.900 --> 27:02.100]  Or that won't share they they will not share with the fbi. They will not share with the dhs
[27:02.100 --> 27:10.820]  The details or the emails or the data that they need to do this investigation. So let's go to j johnson today though
[27:10.820 --> 27:12.980]  These are some clips from today, and there's I mean
[27:13.620 --> 27:17.780]  Literally the most unbelievable quotes again coming out of this nonsense of a hearing
[27:17.780 --> 27:21.780]  We have all kinds of collusion on the democrat side of it literally a lawsuit against the dnc
[27:22.020 --> 27:24.740]  But we're still looking around everywhere for russia collusion that doesn't exist
[27:24.980 --> 27:30.020]  So here's j johnson though saying that he knows it was putin that orchestrated the cyber attacks
[27:30.020 --> 27:36.900]  In three years as secretary of homeland security. I had the privilege of testifying before congress 26 times
[27:38.260 --> 27:43.620]  Though it is no longer part of my job description. I voluntarily accepted the invitation to be here today
[27:44.340 --> 27:46.340]  as concerned private citizen
[27:46.420 --> 27:52.020]  Oh, he's so transparent in 2016 the russian government. They didn't want to build this hearing about that putin himself
[27:52.820 --> 27:57.940]  orchestrated cyber attacks on our nation for the purpose of influencing our election
[27:57.940 --> 28:00.900]  That is a fact plain and simple
[28:01.700 --> 28:05.060]  Now the key question for the president and the congress is
[28:05.780 --> 28:09.220]  What are we going to do to protect the american people and their democracy?
[28:09.220 --> 28:13.860]  Okay, so there he is he says he knows for a fact that it was russia and putin that did it
[28:14.180 --> 28:17.060]  And what are we going to do? We have to do something. This is an assault
[28:17.300 --> 28:20.260]  This is an assault on our country and our infrastructure. We must do something
[28:20.820 --> 28:22.820]  Okay, so we'll address that in a second
[28:22.820 --> 28:29.460]  But how can he possibly know that with this clip that johnson said later in his testimony?
[28:30.340 --> 28:35.300]  As to what was all for them what they accepted was at any level of cooperation at all
[28:36.100 --> 28:41.700]  Um to my disappointment not to my knowledge, sir. Um, and this is the question I asked repeatedly
[28:42.340 --> 28:45.380]  When I first learned of it, you know, what are we doing? Are we in there?
[28:45.940 --> 28:48.900]  Are we helping them discover the vulnerabilities because this was
[28:48.900 --> 28:52.420]  a fresh off the opium experience and
[28:53.300 --> 28:59.940]  There was a point at which dhs cyber security experts did get into opium and actually help them discover
[29:00.820 --> 29:02.580]  The bad actors
[29:02.580 --> 29:06.660]  And patch some of the exfiltrations or at least minimize some of the damage
[29:06.660 --> 29:09.380]  And so I was anxious to know whether or not our folks were in there
[29:10.180 --> 29:13.940]  And the response I got was fbi had spoken to them
[29:13.940 --> 29:19.940]  Uh, they don't want our help. They have crowd strike. They have crowd strike. That's the key thing. That's a democrat
[29:20.900 --> 29:22.900]  That's a democrat contractor
[29:22.900 --> 29:28.180]  Crowd strike was hired by the democrats. They were running their it system and when this stuff came out
[29:28.180 --> 29:30.740]  They said we were hacked and it was the russians
[29:30.820 --> 29:35.540]  And yet the guy who got all this stuff julien assange said it was not a state actor
[29:35.700 --> 29:39.300]  It was turned over to us julien assange has never lied to us
[29:39.300 --> 29:44.820]  These people have given us nothing but lies and crowd strike a dnc contractor
[29:45.220 --> 29:50.020]  Refused to turn over or allow access to those servers. How do they do that?
[29:50.340 --> 29:52.340]  Well, of course, this is because it's all political
[29:52.420 --> 29:55.620]  They've invented this not only to cover up for hillary clinton losing
[29:55.860 --> 29:59.700]  But to cover up for their illegal surveillance of political opponents
[30:00.020 --> 30:03.940]  This is the big story when meghan kelly was here. She asked me what you think about putin
[30:04.020 --> 30:08.180]  I guess you wanted me to comment on her interview. I said i'm not concerned about putin
[30:08.180 --> 30:14.180]  I'm concerned about people like clapper and hayden and these others who are using
[30:14.660 --> 30:21.780]  Our intelligence community as a politicized weapon against their opponents and that's what we're seeing here this russian
[30:22.420 --> 30:24.900]  Wait, so let me get this right covering that up. So let me get this rate
[30:24.900 --> 30:29.300]  The dnc won't cooperate with the fbi. The dnc won't cooperate with dhs
[30:29.380 --> 30:34.900]  Debbie washerman solz is threatening those people for doing investigations. Seth rich has died
[30:34.900 --> 30:39.300]  Sean lucas has died whiz and hunt jr in florida the prosecutor has died
[30:40.180 --> 30:44.100]  It's clearly the russians. Yeah, it must be the russians. It's the russians now
[30:44.180 --> 30:45.540]  We've got this story on the other side
[30:45.700 --> 30:52.180]  It must be the russians that are classifying the documents in the obama library that would show that it was susan rice
[30:52.340 --> 30:57.460]  That was unmasking names. That must be the russians too. That's real obstruction of justice
[30:57.620 --> 31:02.340]  That is what should be investigated and it must be the russians that were meeting on the tarmac with loretta lynch
[31:02.340 --> 31:06.180]  It must have been the russians. That was the dnc chair
[31:06.260 --> 31:11.780]  John podesta making stock deals with other russians. That must have been the russians too. It's all the russians are on the march
[31:12.180 --> 31:14.180]  The empire's on the run
[31:14.740 --> 31:17.540]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[31:21.940 --> 31:29.620]  Left us in europe carried out 27 terror attacks in 2016 which debunks the claim that conservatives and libertarians represent a bigger extremist threat
[31:29.620 --> 31:35.540]  Over 140 terrorist attacks occurred in europe last year and 27 of them were blamed on leftist in comparison
[31:35.620 --> 31:41.700]  Just one right-wing terror attack was recorded for the entire year 13 attacks were blamed on jihadis while the majority of the attacks
[31:41.780 --> 31:48.340]  Nearly 100 were by separatist movements terrorist attacks, which led to deaths and injuries are almost exclusively islamic
[31:48.500 --> 31:55.860]  And guess who advocates open borders and radical islam is select the statistics disprove the narrative that conservatives and libertarians
[31:55.860 --> 32:01.460]  Represent a major terrorist threat a claim the major media was pushing after the recent attack on muslim snare mosque in london
[32:01.540 --> 32:07.060]  The study came from europe hole a law enforcement agency of the european union tasked with combating organized crime and terrorism
[32:07.140 --> 32:12.980]  Additionally terror experts in the u.s. Are also warning that left-wing terror represents a far bigger concern than ever before
[32:13.140 --> 32:19.940]  Which isn't surprising given how the establishment keeps promoting violence against president trump. You can find out more at info wars dot com

[33:28.340 --> 33:34.660]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate iq and how the government
[33:34.900 --> 33:41.220]  Knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride the bad member of the halogen family into the water
[33:41.220 --> 33:48.580]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in and when the fukushima crisis worsened as it still is worsening today
[33:48.740 --> 33:52.500]  I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family now in
[33:53.300 --> 34:01.140]  2016 even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut which many experts are now saying
[34:01.300 --> 34:06.500]  Could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine. You can pull these studies up for yourself
[34:06.500 --> 34:12.900]  This is the real deal folks and the truth is that iodine is essential in my view to any optimum health regimen
[34:13.140 --> 34:21.060]  Stock up on survival shield x2 today at info wars life.com or by calling 888-253-3139
[34:27.700 --> 34:32.580]  The answer to 1984 is 1776
[34:32.580 --> 34:40.180]  You're listening to the alex jones show. Yes, you are with oven shroy or david night coming to you from deep heart of texas gentlemen
[34:40.500 --> 34:44.900]  I see that those wild horses that drug you away couldn't keep you away for long, huh?
[34:45.780 --> 34:48.180]  Absolutely. This is a working vacation
[34:48.740 --> 34:50.980]  Um, you know me for a vacation. There's a few hours
[34:51.860 --> 34:56.740]  My vacation day was spending an extra hour this morning with my daughters and with my son
[34:57.300 --> 35:02.260]  You know the children that the media says have been taken away from me that are with me about 85 90% of the time
[35:02.260 --> 35:06.020]  But I'm getting away from that. They're trying to brand me as a loser
[35:06.340 --> 35:11.460]  They're trying to brand trump as a loser. They're trying to brand america as a loser
[35:11.620 --> 35:16.340]  That's like loy blank fine started his new twitter account a month ago to troll
[35:17.220 --> 35:19.220]  trump and say look at china's
[35:19.700 --> 35:23.380]  Infrastructure it's so much better than ours now if they transferred our jobs there
[35:24.260 --> 35:26.260]  And boy, how's your infrastructure week going?
[35:26.260 --> 35:33.620]  Totally sick totally evil working against trump at every level even though they've made 30% more of the biggest profits
[35:33.620 --> 35:37.780]  They've ever made since trump got in the globalists don't want the general public to have money
[35:38.020 --> 35:39.300]  That's the essence of it
[35:39.300 --> 35:45.220]  But there are a lot of billionaire investors and a lot of people that have been inside globalism that know it's evil like peter teal
[35:45.460 --> 35:47.460]  And they are fighting against this system
[35:47.700 --> 35:52.500]  There is no doubt about it because they know it's authoritarian and it is collapsing
[35:52.500 --> 35:56.660]  So these arrogant globalists like warren buffet and peter teal uh, uh, uh, uh
[35:57.060 --> 36:03.940]  Who he's exposed who's been exposing him and other people like loy blank fine that's been exposed by ron paul and myself
[36:04.180 --> 36:06.180]  and of course, uh people like
[36:06.180 --> 36:14.340]  Uh, donald trump. This is an amazing time to be alive. This is americana in a battle with the crony capitalist globalist
[36:14.500 --> 36:19.300]  Just like we were born out of that with the british empire in 1776 the exact same system
[36:19.300 --> 36:23.620]  But the reason i popped in with this big full transmission you guys have today is this
[36:24.180 --> 36:26.180]  This victory in georgia
[36:26.180 --> 36:33.060]  With democrat white people calling her a cracker ass and stuff trying to invoke race war totally sick totally evil totally transparent
[36:33.220 --> 36:35.220]  Is the fourth failure
[36:35.620 --> 36:40.180]  Of special elections in the last five months since president trump got into office
[36:40.340 --> 36:47.140]  And why is that important the democrats admit that they have put nearly 80 of their democratic party budget
[36:47.140 --> 36:54.980]  We're talking over a hundred million dollars that they had for this four or five month period on defeating these four candidates
[36:55.300 --> 36:59.140]  They threw everything in the media. They had dirty tricks total assaults
[36:59.300 --> 37:01.300]  We're talking two to one three to one four to one
[37:01.780 --> 37:03.780]  Spending against these people
[37:03.940 --> 37:09.540]  But still they lost in every single case despite illegal aliens voting despite all this happening
[37:09.540 --> 37:14.820]  And now the washington times is out with big giant major scientific studies showing four point
[37:14.820 --> 37:20.180]  No, excuse me five point seven million illegals potentially voted illegally
[37:20.420 --> 37:25.380]  That's way above the three point two three point five that trump and others talked about and this is what the media does
[37:25.380 --> 37:28.180]  It's not that info wars isn't accurate. It's just that we are
[37:29.140 --> 37:31.700]  Aggressive we wear the truth on our sleeve
[37:32.500 --> 37:34.900]  We don't sit there and act like you know, we're non-bias
[37:35.540 --> 37:39.940]  You know journalists we're totally biased for telling the truth in america. So they have pure research
[37:39.940 --> 37:46.820]  Uh, george washington mason research all these big studies showing over three million illegals voted in the previous election of this one
[37:46.980 --> 37:49.380]  And they have the evidence showing it ramp way up. So what do they do?
[37:49.860 --> 37:52.820]  They don't say george washington mason's wrong. They don't say pew's wrong
[37:53.220 --> 37:57.220]  They say we're wrong and that we just made it up and they go here's jones saying it
[37:57.380 --> 38:02.020]  But he won't tell you where the proof is but ten seconds before I said where the proof was
[38:02.180 --> 38:06.500]  That's what meghan kelly did in her interview and rob do's going over the hours and hours of it
[38:06.500 --> 38:11.940]  We're going to devastate her people say well, then why not just release it well because we're going to edit it
[38:11.940 --> 38:14.740]  But let me explain we're gonna play raw what I said
[38:15.460 --> 38:19.140]  But they edited it where I talked about something here 10 minutes later
[38:19.140 --> 38:20.340]  I talked about something there
[38:20.340 --> 38:23.860]  They would jump cut it and weld it together to make new sentences
[38:24.020 --> 38:29.140]  Just like if I had the bible I took a page out of deuteronomy and then put it with a page of say revelations
[38:29.460 --> 38:34.260]  Out of context and said it was a new bible verse or said that jesus christ said it it would be a lie
[38:34.260 --> 38:39.460]  It's like that refrigerator magnet game where you have all the different names all the different words all the different slogans
[38:39.540 --> 38:44.820]  All the different terms all the verbs all the adjectives and then you just scramble together what you want
[38:45.140 --> 38:50.180]  That's what they do with this deceptive editing and even mainstream media recognize that so again
[38:50.580 --> 38:56.900]  Even though they destroyed me in the interview the biggest hit piece on earth the most horrible stammering moron
[38:56.900 --> 39:00.820]  You can imagine they are so discredited and so hated in such a joke
[39:00.820 --> 39:05.300]  It made people love us even more. This is crazy. I knew it was the right thing to do
[39:05.860 --> 39:07.380]  To go into the lion's den
[39:07.380 --> 39:13.300]  But let me tell you the prayers of our listeners the support our affiliates our sponsors this awesome crew
[39:13.780 --> 39:19.060]  Right here that is the best crew I've ever had is just so amazing out of a lot of great crews. This is our family
[39:19.860 --> 39:24.980]  The listeners are our family and trump has delivered on like 40 of what he said he'd do
[39:24.980 --> 39:30.580]  In four years it took Reagan years to deliver on just a third of what Trump's done
[39:30.660 --> 39:36.500]  Is he perfect? No, but on tpp on nafta on gat on the carbon taxes all of it
[39:36.500 --> 39:38.740]  He's delivering on the border becoming secured
[39:39.060 --> 39:43.540]  43 cut down on all those issues on the stock market on jobs
[39:43.860 --> 39:50.020]  But he's in a race as the globalists try to implode and consolidate the economy with people like bezos and others
[39:50.340 --> 39:52.340]  So again, this is a critical time
[39:52.340 --> 39:54.340]  To be alive right now
[39:54.580 --> 40:00.100]  Everybody is involved in this fight on one side of the other if you're passive and sit there on the sidelines
[40:00.180 --> 40:03.700]  You're helping the globalist so in closing let you guys get back your full raft
[40:04.020 --> 40:09.620]  I mean just actually overflowing transmission today ladies and gentlemen. They have put everything they had
[40:10.420 --> 40:12.820]  Into defeating trump and america and americana
[40:13.300 --> 40:19.060]  They put everything they can their demonization their lies their frauds their pessimism every negative story you can imagine
[40:19.060 --> 40:23.140]  To stop these four candidates and they failed. This is a big bellwether
[40:23.380 --> 40:28.580]  But the america is awake that the brainwashing isn't working that people aren't deserting trump
[40:28.740 --> 40:31.300]  In fact, he's getting stronger even in their fake polls
[40:31.860 --> 40:34.420]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is an incredible time to be alive
[40:34.580 --> 40:39.780]  We've got to call their bluff and break the conditioning and break the trance back to oh and shroyer and david knight
[40:40.020 --> 40:44.100]  Great stuff from alex jones. Thank you alex jones our fearless leader
[40:44.100 --> 40:50.980]  Uh on a vacation right so um, I want to get back to david got a big story here that I want to get him to cover
[40:50.980 --> 40:55.540]  But I think just to to kind of give a preamble to david breaking this down
[40:56.020 --> 41:00.100]  Let's recall that the first thing was russia hacking the election russia hacking the election
[41:00.100 --> 41:04.100]  That was the narrative russia hacking the election then they kind of softened that and they said well
[41:04.180 --> 41:08.820]  Maybe they were just hacking voter logs. Maybe they were just hacking the dnc. Okay, but it was hacking hacking hacking
[41:08.820 --> 41:15.460]  Well, it came out. It was the dhs that was hacking. It was the dnc that was rigging the election
[41:15.620 --> 41:17.140]  but now the
[41:17.140 --> 41:20.740]  It's moved one further and they're saying obstruction of justice obstruction of justice
[41:21.140 --> 41:26.740]  Well, now we're finding where the real obstruction of justice is and why they're trying to distract you with that
[41:27.220 --> 41:31.540]  Investigation david knight. What is going on with the susan rise and the obama library?
[41:31.620 --> 41:33.620]  We know what we're seeing in general on is
[41:33.620 --> 41:41.060]  Is what what the liberals would call projection? Okay, they like to talk about the psychological projection projecting your problems your
[41:41.540 --> 41:48.180]  Shortcomings your faults onto other people. What the democrats are doing is they're projecting their crimes. They're very concerned
[41:48.740 --> 41:53.940]  The people are going to find out that they use the national security apparatus as a political tool
[41:54.580 --> 41:57.540]  To try to win this election. That is not only
[41:57.540 --> 42:04.100]  A highly criminal but that will bring them down once that is exposed and we got senators like senator grassley
[42:04.340 --> 42:09.380]  Who are on that? He's he's he's a hardcore guy. He's really the guy who I think should have been attorney general
[42:09.380 --> 42:15.460]  But he is pushing this very hard. So today we see the state department is probing clinton handling of government emails
[42:15.780 --> 42:17.780]  They could pull her security clearance
[42:17.860 --> 42:22.980]  They said they've opened a formal inquiry into this and of course this is again coming from senator grassley
[42:22.980 --> 42:27.380]  And of course they should because this is uh something that
[42:28.100 --> 42:30.660]  James comey said I mean do we not believe james comey?
[42:30.660 --> 42:34.980]  Don't the democrats believe him we've been told that he's everything that he says is true
[42:34.980 --> 42:36.900]  Even though so he said she said
[42:36.900 --> 42:40.260]  Between him and uh and trump we should believe everything that comey says
[42:40.260 --> 42:46.580]  Well, he was the one who said that she had it was extremely careless in the handling a very sensitive highly classified information
[42:46.980 --> 42:52.340]  There was evidence of potential violation of statutes regarding the handling of classified information made it very clear
[42:52.340 --> 42:55.700]  She'd violated the law that she had not handled
[42:56.100 --> 42:58.980]  Uh the highest levels of secured documents very well
[42:59.060 --> 43:04.100]  So if they were to pull her security clearance, so when it would be like what they did to sandy burger
[43:04.340 --> 43:09.060]  This is a guy who to cover up for the clintons went into the national security archives
[43:09.460 --> 43:12.580]  Took out the papers because that's where they were at the time
[43:13.460 --> 43:18.900]  Right after september 11th pulled out the paper stuffed them into his clothing picked them out destroyed them
[43:18.900 --> 43:22.740]  They caught him doing that he is now the poster child at the national security archives
[43:23.220 --> 43:27.220]  They show him they say do not let people violate our procedures
[43:27.220 --> 43:31.300]  No matter how important or well known they are they have to follow the procedures
[43:31.620 --> 43:38.020]  So he's a poster child for that james comey was the one who let him off with simply losing his security clearance
[43:38.580 --> 43:42.740]  So if that were to happen she'd be getting the the uh sandy burger treatment
[43:42.900 --> 43:44.260]  But here's the other part of this, you know
[43:44.260 --> 43:49.780]  We we see that history doesn't repeat itself, but it really does rhyme and here's how it's rhyming
[43:50.260 --> 43:53.220]  Judicial watch exposed the fact that susan rice
[43:54.100 --> 44:00.100]  Unmasking documents have been moved from the national security uh council to the obama library
[44:00.660 --> 44:02.660]  And they came back and they said well, i'm sorry
[44:02.820 --> 44:04.820]  We can't give you that information
[44:05.460 --> 44:09.940]  Because we move that to the obama presidential library you can send your request to them
[44:09.940 --> 44:16.820]  However, you should be aware that under the presidential records act presidential records remain closed to the public for five years
[44:17.220 --> 44:20.100]  After the administration has left office what they have done
[44:20.580 --> 44:24.980]  Is in a very subtle way the same thing that sandy burger did they took
[44:25.540 --> 44:29.860]  incriminating evidence showing they violated the law and they have basically buried it
[44:30.420 --> 44:34.260]  And hiding behind this presidential the statue of the presidential records act
[44:34.820 --> 44:38.660]  This is obstruction of justice. They need to be called on this
[44:38.660 --> 44:43.380]  Uh judicial watch has been very good about uh following up on these types of things. He said they're going to uh
[44:44.260 --> 44:49.860]  Probably take legal action on this and this was something that was exposed in april by sernovich and others
[44:50.820 --> 44:53.620]  Followed him talking about the fact that susan rice
[44:54.100 --> 45:00.420]  Had unmasked this and this these are crimes that involve uh the nsa and comey's fbi
[45:00.580 --> 45:04.820]  They violated the law when they spied on americans in america
[45:04.820 --> 45:11.300]  Their supposed authorization for this is only to spy on foreign citizens in foreign countries
[45:11.860 --> 45:14.020]  And then americans if they're connected with that
[45:14.500 --> 45:20.500]  But not to ever release this information unless the americans are under investigation and there's a search warrant out there
[45:20.580 --> 45:25.380]  What they did was they violated all of that the fbi violated the uh nsa violated that
[45:25.860 --> 45:31.060]  And they unmasked this information and they did it not only to president trump and his administration
[45:31.060 --> 45:38.420]  But they did it to others ran paul said he's heard that he's one of the subjects of that as well as many other senators congressman
[45:38.980 --> 45:42.340]  journalists they're using the national security spy state
[45:43.060 --> 45:49.300]  For political purposes. This is huge and this oan is why they are talking about russia
[45:49.540 --> 45:54.020]  They're trying to hide their crimes. They're trying to cover this up and that's what i said to
[45:54.580 --> 45:58.020]  Uh meghan kelly when she was here. I said that's what i'm worried about
[45:58.020 --> 46:01.780]  That's what the senate intelligence committee will not talk about they
[46:02.340 --> 46:08.580]  Will not go to the violations of law committed by the intelligence community on the behalf of the obama administration
[46:09.220 --> 46:10.820]  so here's what
[46:10.820 --> 46:14.820]  I would assess everything it would make sense to me you have
[46:15.860 --> 46:18.900]  Obviously the collusion and the corruption is on the democrat side. So what do they do?
[46:19.140 --> 46:26.260]  They use the dhs to go in and probe or whatever all of these voter rolls leaving russian fingerprints there
[46:26.260 --> 46:30.740]  So that they can come back use those fingerprints as evidence in any of these hearings
[46:31.060 --> 46:33.060]  And cite those fingerprints time and time again
[46:33.460 --> 46:36.660]  Even though they're fake finger fingerprints, and there's actually no russian collusion
[46:36.820 --> 46:40.740]  So now you've got this russian investigation stewing and going on for months and months and months
[46:40.980 --> 46:45.700]  Meanwhile, no investigation into susan rice no investigation into james comey
[46:45.860 --> 46:53.620]  Although now you've got a lawsuit coming against james comey in what david night mentioned of the surveillance of americans
[46:53.620 --> 46:57.860]  A former contractor this is from world net daily a former contractor for several jut
[46:58.340 --> 47:04.500]  federal agencies and his attorney who both sued former fbi director james comey claiming he obstructed justice
[47:04.820 --> 47:10.660]  By burying an investigation into the mass surveillance of americans are asking a federal court for protection
[47:10.980 --> 47:14.500]  For a protection order preventing the destruction of evidence in the case
[47:14.980 --> 47:19.380]  Oh, oh, yeah, like sending it to the obama library to have it classified for five years
[47:19.380 --> 47:25.540]  The plaintiffs are denise mount gummary a whistleblower who worked as a contractor for the national security agency
[47:25.940 --> 47:31.620]  The cia and the director of national intelligence and his lawyer larry climb in of freedom watch
[47:31.620 --> 47:34.260]  I think larry's actually been on with alex before yeah quite a time
[47:34.340 --> 47:39.860]  Yeah, so maybe we can get larry on um sometime to talk with alex before the end of the week about this lawsuit
[47:40.180 --> 47:42.340]  So it's amazing david you have
[47:43.300 --> 47:45.780]  Independent lawsuits you have people like chuck grassley
[47:45.780 --> 47:50.980]  Uh, you have people like us who are exposing all of the corruption on the democrat side, you know bright bard
[47:50.980 --> 47:55.700]  I think they were the one that printed that article judicial watch trying to get these documents to the public
[47:56.420 --> 48:00.420]  And it's clear it's so clear where the obstruction of justice is
[48:00.900 --> 48:05.300]  Where the hacking was on going on where the collusion is it's all on the democrats
[48:05.540 --> 48:07.620]  That's why they've put this russian red herring out there
[48:07.860 --> 48:12.660]  That's why they're spending all this time on this to avoid the real investigation going on at the democrats
[48:12.660 --> 48:16.100]  And i'm just wondering if we'll ever get there. Will we ever get over this russia hump?
[48:16.180 --> 48:22.020]  Are they gonna continue with all these hearings continue with this investigation new here new there the russians are hacking in 2018
[48:22.180 --> 48:26.420]  They're hacking in 2020. They're hacking in europe. We must do something about russia. They want war
[48:26.580 --> 48:29.300]  You know, oh, and I I think this hearing that we're seeing today
[48:29.780 --> 48:33.620]  To try to cover their tracks with jay johnson and of course this is a guy who starts out by saying
[48:33.700 --> 48:37.940]  I'm very happy to do this for you as a citizen even though. I don't have any
[48:37.940 --> 48:44.100]  Uh responsibility to do this. I you know, it wants to be so transparent and yet this is a guy who stonewalled
[48:44.980 --> 48:51.780]  congressmen who are asking him why his agency was illegally hacking into the georgia state board of elections
[48:51.860 --> 48:54.020]  Why were you getting into the voter rolls?
[48:54.580 --> 48:58.820]  They didn't get any response from him then uh, they did us several different letters
[48:58.900 --> 49:06.100]  And then we found out after that they got into indiana as well 15 000 times they attempted to get into indiana
[49:06.100 --> 49:12.980]  So as this is building and they're saying we're still not getting any information from these people. We need to investigate this
[49:13.700 --> 49:17.940]  Then we see that there is the hiring of reality winner when all this broke
[49:18.340 --> 49:22.180]  I went back and I looked at the timeline of this and reported on this on the nightly news
[49:22.820 --> 49:29.060]  They create a document. I believe uh, well, this is the nsa report they created then in may after this stuff had been
[49:29.060 --> 49:36.740]  Uh churning and building and congress wanting to know why the department of homeland security yj johnson violated the law
[49:37.140 --> 49:39.140]  Penetrated these state boards of elections
[49:39.620 --> 49:46.740]  Uh, then we have this nsa document that suddenly is written in may after this has been going on for a couple of months and building
[49:47.460 --> 49:52.340]  Saying well, we think that russians were involved and then they happened to put it somewhere
[49:52.660 --> 49:58.740]  Where this 25 year old bernie sanders supporter can find it and release it to people and they say see see
[49:58.740 --> 50:00.740]  We knew all along. It was the russians
[50:00.900 --> 50:05.380]  There was no evidence that it was anything other than department of homeland security
[50:05.620 --> 50:09.940]  That was getting into these voter rolls and you have to ask yourself when it comes out and says we know for
[50:10.340 --> 50:14.340]  Certain that it was vladimir putin himself that ordered this that is an absolute
[50:14.420 --> 50:17.300]  Yeah, and then he goes on security cameras and the kremland
[50:17.380 --> 50:20.660]  Well, he goes on to admit he says well, they won't cooperate so we can't possibly know who it is
[50:20.740 --> 50:22.820]  We have to take just take their word for it and it's funny
[50:22.820 --> 50:26.500]  You talk about just leaving that there for reality winner to possibly pick up sure
[50:26.500 --> 50:31.860]  I wonder if that's kind of like the new york times just leaving a story out there on april 12th talking about the g.o.p
[50:31.940 --> 50:37.220]  Baseball practice for some left-wing lunatic to pick up and then go stake out the baseball field for a couple months
[50:37.460 --> 50:40.100]  I don't know just a theory, but you know, it's interesting
[50:40.740 --> 50:44.500]  Because this whole russia thing, you know, if you talk about the historical
[50:45.780 --> 50:52.100]  The historical aspect of this what is something throughout history that goes on when you have a political party
[50:52.260 --> 50:54.420]  Or a political group of people or oligarchs, whatever
[50:54.420 --> 50:58.340]  That's corruption is catching up to them. The roosters are coming home
[50:59.140 --> 51:01.700]  What do they do they start wars?
[51:02.420 --> 51:06.020]  That's why they're trying to start this war with russia. I think david more than anything
[51:06.100 --> 51:09.140]  I think and they know that syria is the powder keg
[51:09.620 --> 51:15.060]  To get it all kicked off and then and and and I hope and we elected president trump under the
[51:15.780 --> 51:21.220]  Hope that he understood the situation in the middle east and that we don't have any national interest in syria
[51:21.220 --> 51:28.420]  We don't have any national interest in afghanistan. Um, but right now it looks like we're falling right into that military industrial complex
[51:28.900 --> 51:33.140]  But I think they want war with russia. That's what the democrats wanted the whole time to avoid
[51:34.100 --> 51:39.060]  Justice in all the corruption that they've been guilty of over the long stretch of time
[51:39.060 --> 51:44.820]  But now it's finally caught up with them with the dnc with seth rich with shan lucas with all of it
[51:45.220 --> 51:47.220]  And that lawsuit is still ongoing
[51:47.220 --> 51:52.020]  Well, you know, we have an article on info wars.com today if the u.s continues to creep toward world war three
[51:52.100 --> 51:54.580]  Eventually, it is going to happen as by michael snider
[51:54.580 --> 51:57.860]  He says after a bit of a lull in the past couple of months the march towards war
[51:58.260 --> 52:00.260]  Appears to be accelerating once again
[52:00.740 --> 52:07.460]  He has a quote from president trump while I greatly appreciate the efforts of president z and china to help with north korea
[52:07.700 --> 52:13.140]  It has not worked out at least. I know china tried that sounds very ominous
[52:13.140 --> 52:17.620]  We're going to talk about that. We're going to talk about syria when we come back
[52:17.940 --> 52:23.380]  And we need to think about the fact that uh, we had the uh underground bunkers that they created
[52:23.380 --> 52:25.780]  We'll be right back republican presidential candidate
[52:26.260 --> 52:32.740]  I love these summer months because this is when I get to enjoy the fresh fruits and vegetables that are being harvested on small farms
[52:32.740 --> 52:34.260]  And in our backyards
[52:34.260 --> 52:36.820]  We all look forward to garden tomatoes and corn on the cob
[52:37.300 --> 52:40.980]  No, you wish there was a better way to preserve their true taste and flavors
[52:40.980 --> 52:47.700]  I'm here to tell you that there is a better way. It's by using the amazing home freeze dryer from harvest rite
[52:48.180 --> 52:51.540]  I have a harvest rite freeze dryer and use it to preserve the foods
[52:51.540 --> 52:57.140]  I love strawberries apples and even lasagna and ice cream can stay fresh for 25 years
[52:57.460 --> 53:02.980]  And the best part of my freeze drying is my family and I have a supply of long-lasting food on hand
[53:03.300 --> 53:06.260]  So no matter what may come we feel better prepared
[53:06.260 --> 53:14.340]  We love our freeze dryer to learn more go to harvest rite.com or call 800-923-9591

[53:21.060 --> 53:25.780]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of
[53:26.100 --> 53:31.460]  Seeking and testing to find the very best systems that god gave us through mother nature to detoxify the body
[53:31.460 --> 53:37.780]  That's why I'm introducing z-shield toxic metal and chemical defense support. It's made in the usa
[53:37.940 --> 53:44.580]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the m4
[53:44.740 --> 53:46.740]  It is a classical 360 win
[53:46.900 --> 53:50.420]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year
[53:50.500 --> 53:56.340]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get

[55:33.060 --> 55:35.860]  Who's going to be in hosting in the next hour?
[55:36.180 --> 55:41.620]  He of course is a multi-billionaire founder of a lot of successful companies and the biggest franchise
[55:41.620 --> 55:46.900]  Uh in history curves and he now spends most of his money battling the globalist behind the scenes
[55:47.060 --> 55:53.220]  But i gotta tell you he took us in his own personal plane in aid missions with joe biggs and michael's everman incredibly dangerous
[55:53.620 --> 55:55.220]  Folks died that day
[55:55.220 --> 55:58.020]  Actually trying to land as well in the bad weather after hurricane
[55:58.420 --> 56:02.980]  A delivering aid and he's been behind the scenes working with a lot of folks to expose what was happening
[56:03.220 --> 56:08.500]  They were also there to expose the child sex trafficking being run by people connected to the clinton foundation
[56:09.060 --> 56:11.060]  And others that's now all come out
[56:11.060 --> 56:15.540]  Uh nine months after gary haven first broken with joe biggs and info wars
[56:16.020 --> 56:18.580]  And again, we're not bragging it's facts here now
[56:18.580 --> 56:25.940]  It's come out thousands of children traffic hundreds killed by the un just type in ap report a massive un
[56:26.260 --> 56:31.860]  sex trafficking of children ap and covers numerous sexual abuse allegations against un peacekeepers
[56:31.940 --> 56:36.020]  It's industrial level and that's the ap's whitewash on that
[56:36.020 --> 56:41.060]  Uh, so gary haven doesn't want people to say it, but he is a hero and we look for him to be doing more in
[56:41.220 --> 56:45.940]  Haiti uh in the near future because he's the man on the ground. Uh, gary haven tell us what's coming up in the next hour
[56:46.420 --> 56:50.420]  Yeah, we've got a lot to talk about. Uh, i want to spend a few minutes on uh, uh,
[56:50.820 --> 56:53.380]  Alex's interview this last sunday that everybody's talking about
[56:53.620 --> 56:58.820]  There's a couple of important points that i think we need to discuss so, uh, we'll get to that also
[56:58.820 --> 57:09.220]  Uh, the stanford university just released a study uh that demonstrated that the electronic voting machines produced a nine percent advantage for hillary
[57:09.620 --> 57:13.940]  And this is stanford. This isn't a conservative stuff here. We I think we need to talk about that
[57:14.340 --> 57:17.540]  By the way, I was devastated like I said trump was really 15 points ahead
[57:17.940 --> 57:21.140]  Yep, uh, I was on the phone with the governor of texas monday
[57:21.460 --> 57:24.980]  It was able to share that with him in the governor texas who's one of us by the way
[57:24.980 --> 57:32.100]  He's a sharp guy was not aware that the electronic voting machines have been proven because there's a media blackout or the new big studies
[57:32.500 --> 57:35.300]  Uh that 5.7 million illegals voted. Yep
[57:35.940 --> 57:40.020]  Uh, and the other thing I want to talk about today that I think is important is the seth rich story
[57:40.420 --> 57:44.980]  Uh, a group of grad students in washington did their own investigation and that was released today
[57:45.220 --> 57:48.820]  So bright board. So we'll be talking about that as well. All right guys take back over
[57:48.820 --> 57:54.580]  He's in at eight after second hour is going to be huge trump totally proven right 5.7 million illegals
[57:55.460 --> 57:56.980]  Clearly we're able to vote
[57:56.980 --> 58:01.060]  Uh, we we have a nine point advantage for hillary stanford shows with the machines
[58:01.300 --> 58:06.100]  We have them sampling nine to 15 points more in polls for her and now for democrats
[58:06.180 --> 58:10.020]  So if he's got 50 at gallop, that means he's at least 59 points
[58:10.180 --> 58:14.020]  It's all a giant hoax just like info war is imploding is a giant hoax
[58:14.020 --> 58:18.740]  We're on the march the empire is on the run. God bless you all for your support. We got free shipping running
[58:19.140 --> 58:22.820]  Uh throughout the next week or so and some of the biggest sales ever for the fourth of july
[58:22.900 --> 58:26.580]  We need the funding to go to the next level back to day by night. No insurer and don't forget
[58:26.740 --> 58:31.620]  We have the project veritas and the wiki leaks cold hard evidence
[58:32.100 --> 58:35.540]  To support the claims that were just made now
[58:35.620 --> 58:39.220]  This is just breaking before we go to break and in the next hour
[58:39.220 --> 58:44.660]  We're going to be joined by gary haven and joe bakes to cover the waterfront, but this is just breaking top of drudge
[58:45.220 --> 58:49.620]  NBC news feds looking into flint airport stabbing as possible act of terrorism
[58:49.860 --> 58:55.700]  Canadian-born suspect shouted al-ahu akbar and then stabbed a police officer
[58:55.860 --> 58:58.900]  So this is just breaking of terrorism only upon right
[58:59.860 --> 59:01.860]  See but that we can't know for sure
[59:01.940 --> 59:06.500]  When he stabs a policeman shouting al-ahu akbar, we can't know that that is terrorism
[59:06.500 --> 59:09.940]  We have to investigate that for a while. Of course when it's um
[59:10.340 --> 59:15.060]  When it's a white person that mows down people outside of a mosque, it's immediately a white supremacist
[59:15.140 --> 59:22.820]  It's immediately a right wing radical. It's immediately a right wing terrorist this that and the other thing, but again, I'm you know
[59:23.780 --> 59:28.900]  We completely disavowed that act. That is a disgusting act. I don't wish any violence upon any mosques at all
[59:28.980 --> 59:32.420]  So I want to stop all of the no and that's civil wars
[59:32.420 --> 59:38.180]  That is something that we've that we've said from the very beginning if the government brings the terrorists
[59:38.260 --> 59:43.540]  And it's a class of civilizations remove them and do documentaries about them like they did in the uk
[59:44.100 --> 59:47.700]  Let this happen. They are inviting a pushback
[59:47.780 --> 59:53.300]  They want a civil war and that's what we're starting to see the beginning of here exactly what the globalist wanted
[59:53.540 --> 59:59.860]  Free shipping infowarstore.com free shipping infowarstore.com take this broadcast to the next level
[59:59.860 --> 1:00:05.780]  We'll be right back second hour of the alex joneshow owen shroyer david night soon to be joined by joe biggs and gary haven
[1:00:14.660 --> 1:00:17.540]  Let's go to debit in florida debit in florida. You're on the air

[1:00:32.180 --> 1:00:36.820]  I've got the body armor. Wow. Thank you. Wow. You're the type of lesser than makes it all possible
[1:00:36.900 --> 1:00:42.180]  Which dude for cynical does you like best? I really like the vitamin mineral fusion to be honest
[1:00:42.260 --> 1:00:47.860]  That's amazing. I drank it in the morning and I swear to you I felt incredible like I haven't felt sweet
[1:00:47.940 --> 1:00:52.180]  My morning was fantastic and I and I love the guys. I love the info wars through
[1:00:52.180 --> 1:00:58.260]  And I just want to yeah, I want to I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence
[1:00:58.740 --> 1:01:02.740]  Just buy it. You will love it. I'm telling you. I've never bought a bad product
[1:01:02.980 --> 1:01:09.380]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at info wars life.com. It's a win-win info wars life.com
[1:01:09.380 --> 1:01:17.060]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[1:01:17.060 --> 1:01:30.580]  Before america can be great again. She must be free again. You're listening to the alex jones show
[1:01:32.980 --> 1:01:35.780]  I'm telling you the fact that there was no media
[1:01:35.780 --> 1:01:47.060]  Buildup of this j johnson testimony today is just a little fishy to me. I'm not sure why they didn't build it up like they did
[1:01:47.460 --> 1:01:49.460]  The sessions or comey testimony
[1:01:50.020 --> 1:01:57.300]  But it's still going on and there's all kinds of bombshells that are just getting dropped all throughout this testimony. I think it's finally concluded
[1:01:57.700 --> 1:02:01.700]  I'd have to go back to the beginning of the video
[1:02:01.700 --> 1:02:06.580]  All throughout this testimony. I think it's finally concluded. I'd have to check back, but
[1:02:08.020 --> 1:02:11.860]  Again, I say based on what we've discovered over the past 12 months that you have a
[1:02:12.980 --> 1:02:17.060]  Full justifiable cause to abolish the dhs and the cia
[1:02:17.540 --> 1:02:21.860]  Immediately, uh, but that's just my opinion. I wonder I wonder if david knight would agree with that
[1:02:21.860 --> 1:02:23.860]  Well, we definitely need to get rid of the voting machine
[1:02:24.100 --> 1:02:31.140]  Issue because as you just heard alex jones and gary haven say there's a bias in these voting machines again for hillary clinton
[1:02:31.140 --> 1:02:33.700]  Of about nine points. It's very easy
[1:02:34.260 --> 1:02:39.940]  To rig an election and we have to understand when we see the department of homeland security under j jones and try to intrude into state
[1:02:40.500 --> 1:02:46.100]  Departments of election you have to understand this kind of fraud unlike the types of election fraud that we've seen before
[1:02:46.660 --> 1:02:48.660]  this type of fraud is
[1:02:49.220 --> 1:02:54.100]  Enterprise expandable as they would say they can take it down to any particular race that they want
[1:02:54.660 --> 1:02:58.180]  And they can rig any particular race that they want as long as we computerize this
[1:02:58.180 --> 1:03:03.460]  It's not going to be safe from enemies foreign or domestic and we've seen I think
[1:03:04.260 --> 1:03:08.020]  Attempts by the obama administration to rig this election
[1:03:08.100 --> 1:03:13.380]  That's what these hearings are about today to not only cover that up and move people away from it
[1:03:13.620 --> 1:03:21.060]  But then to create this false russian narrative to insinuate themselves into the state board of elections calling it critical infrastructure
[1:03:21.300 --> 1:03:26.660]  And in reaction to what they found in indiana you had the state boards of elections, uh, the state attorney
[1:03:26.660 --> 1:03:33.460]  Uh, uh, secretaries of state from various states all called on the trump administration to shut this down
[1:03:33.940 --> 1:03:37.940]  Do not allow homeland security to declare this as critical infrastructure
[1:03:37.940 --> 1:03:43.940]  So this is a dog and pony show to push that forward with their false narrative their false flag if you will
[1:03:44.500 --> 1:03:47.220]  But that's what they're trying to do besides covering up their own crime
[1:03:47.300 --> 1:03:52.580]  This is a hundred percent a false flag the russian hacking claim and that critical infrastructure thing is so key because
[1:03:52.580 --> 1:03:58.660]  Johnson piped that in all the time critical critical infrastructure critical infrastructure critical infrastructure
[1:03:58.740 --> 1:04:01.380]  So they clearly want to do that so they can have complete control
[1:04:01.860 --> 1:04:04.180]  Over our elections and probably just completely rig them
[1:04:04.420 --> 1:04:08.740]  But here were some interesting quotes from some people that came out of today. First of all
[1:04:09.700 --> 1:04:12.420]  You've got johnson engaging in full-on lawyer speak
[1:04:12.980 --> 1:04:16.580]  Saying this isn't again. This isn't the exact quote, but i'm sure we can find the clip
[1:04:16.580 --> 1:04:22.500]  But he said perhaps it could be without reasonable doubt that russia hacked the dnc
[1:04:23.460 --> 1:04:29.540]  Perhaps without so he puts all these you know qualitatives out there like oh, maybe it could be it could be russia
[1:04:29.780 --> 1:04:36.100]  But then he but it's that subconscious inserting that russia hacked the dnc to just force that into the narrative
[1:04:36.100 --> 1:04:41.300]  Even though it's it's total loyal lawyer talk. He knows it's not true. He continues to cite russia probing
[1:04:41.700 --> 1:04:45.860]  But saying no election hack. What is this probing? What is this probing? What are the new probing?
[1:04:45.860 --> 1:04:49.780]  What do you mean? They're probing nobody's probing. You're the ones that are probing because you're trying to rig the election
[1:04:50.100 --> 1:04:52.340]  Then you've got eric swalwell. This is unbelievable
[1:04:52.980 --> 1:05:00.660]  Yeah, we're talking about probing. It was 14 800 scans just into indiana between and that was the hs to december 16th
[1:05:00.740 --> 1:05:03.460]  And it was it was the department of homeland security exactly
[1:05:03.460 --> 1:05:09.700]  So they're the ones probing putting the russian fingerprints out the people who met at the end of february cited that they were members of the national
[1:05:09.700 --> 1:05:11.700]  Association of secretaries of state
[1:05:11.700 --> 1:05:17.620]  They voted all these secretary states from all these different states said they want president trump to overturn
[1:05:18.100 --> 1:05:19.380]  this designation
[1:05:19.380 --> 1:05:25.460]  Of critical infrastructure because they did not want the feds to insert themselves into the state computer voting systems
[1:05:25.540 --> 1:05:29.540]  This is how big of a joke these people are though eric swalwell democrat from california
[1:05:29.540 --> 1:05:34.260]  He's bashing trump with all of his time. They're apparently looking into russia hacking. He uses his time to bash trump
[1:05:34.500 --> 1:05:36.900]  He bashes trump for his rigged election claim
[1:05:36.900 --> 1:05:41.780]  This is on the on the next day of them doing the survey finding out that illegals are voting
[1:05:42.020 --> 1:05:44.980]  He's bashing trump for the rigged election claim then david
[1:05:45.460 --> 1:05:48.260]  He's using his time to claim russia rigged the election
[1:05:48.660 --> 1:05:52.660]  So eric swalwell is making fun of trump saying that elections are rigged
[1:05:52.980 --> 1:05:57.540]  Then he uses the rest of his time to insinuate that russia rigged the election
[1:05:57.780 --> 1:06:03.460]  You've never seen anything like this before denny heck another democrat this one from washington saying russia will be back
[1:06:03.460 --> 1:06:09.300]  Saying that it's the free and open elections. That's why the dnc got sued because they hacked it
[1:06:09.300 --> 1:06:11.940]  But he's saying no, that's why the democrats are acting so violently
[1:06:12.100 --> 1:06:16.900]  That's why they're not accepting their elections because we don't have free and open elections. The russian hacked it
[1:06:17.460 --> 1:06:20.980]  Unbelievable. We're right back. Joe big scary haven. I'll ensure david night out shown show
[1:06:21.780 --> 1:06:29.460]  Leftists in europe carried out 27 terror attacks in 2016 which debunks the claim that conservatives and libertarians represent a bigger extremist threat
[1:06:29.460 --> 1:06:35.380]  Over 140 terrorist attacks occurred in europe last year and 27 of them were blamed on leptis in comparison
[1:06:35.460 --> 1:06:38.580]  Just one right-wing terror attack was recorded for the entire year
[1:06:38.660 --> 1:06:43.860]  13 attacks were blamed on jihadis while the majority of the attacks nearly 100 were by separatist movements
[1:06:44.100 --> 1:06:51.540]  terrorist attacks which led to deaths and injuries are almost exclusively islamic and gets who advocates open borders and radical islam
[1:06:51.780 --> 1:06:57.220]  Is select the statistics disprove the narrative that conservatives and libertarians represent a major terrorist threat
[1:06:57.220 --> 1:07:01.300]  A claim the major media was pushing after the recent attack on muslim snare moscow in london
[1:07:01.380 --> 1:07:06.900]  The study came from europe hole law enforcement agency of the european union tasked with combating organized crime and terrorism
[1:07:06.980 --> 1:07:12.820]  Additionally terror experts in the u.s. Are also warning that left-wing terror represents a far bigger concern than ever before
[1:07:12.980 --> 1:07:19.780]  Which isn't surprising given how the establishment keeps promoting violence against president trump. You can find out more at info wars.com

[1:09:53.780 --> 1:09:59.380]  I'm joined by Gary Haven obviously David night still with us joe big sitting here as well a full-on Jedi council
[1:09:59.940 --> 1:10:06.900]  And a whole waterfront of interesting news to talk about I know Gary that you've got something that's actually near and dear to you
[1:10:06.900 --> 1:10:08.580]  What's going on in Haiti?
[1:10:08.580 --> 1:10:12.980]  The sex trafficking that's going on down there. Why don't we lead off with that? Okay, great
[1:10:13.940 --> 1:10:18.420]  All right, joe. I mentioned during the break something that I hadn't thought about
[1:10:19.940 --> 1:10:22.580]  About megan kelly making a comment once you start off with that
[1:10:22.660 --> 1:10:26.900]  Well, yeah, megan kelly came here and she was questioning you and the other journalists saying hey
[1:10:27.540 --> 1:10:31.780]  You consider yourself a journalist, you know, like that was a big one when you wake up in the morning and you go
[1:10:31.780 --> 1:10:33.700]  Well, I pray I look at the news
[1:10:33.700 --> 1:10:38.660]  I you know, I kind of come up with my own commentary and give my opinion on what I'm seeing or my you know
[1:10:38.660 --> 1:10:42.900]  What I do which is what pretty much all people who do what we do do, you know
[1:10:42.900 --> 1:10:44.260]  They all have that same thing
[1:10:44.260 --> 1:10:47.060]  But what she doesn't do is get out from behind her desk
[1:10:47.220 --> 1:10:51.940]  What she does do is read a teleprompter and what we don't do here is read teleprompters
[1:10:51.940 --> 1:10:55.620]  We don't have a single teleprompter in this entire place. We aren't given any script
[1:10:56.020 --> 1:10:59.460]  Right, we read the news. We give our honest analysis on what it is
[1:10:59.460 --> 1:11:03.940]  We see and she says certain has the gall to tell us. Oh, well, you guys aren't journalists
[1:11:04.180 --> 1:11:08.180]  I don't see her going to Haiti. There was no one else out there when we went. It was just us
[1:11:08.500 --> 1:11:13.220]  Yeah, I didn't see her. I didn't see her ever on the streets dealing with protesters or at the rnc or the dnc
[1:11:13.220 --> 1:11:16.980]  I never saw her out there. I never saw her at ferguson. I didn't see I saw you at ferguson actually
[1:11:17.060 --> 1:11:19.620]  I saw you at ferguson, but no megan was a Paris attack
[1:11:19.780 --> 1:11:24.900]  And what they do is they get an assignment from their editor. They're told what to cover
[1:11:24.900 --> 1:11:31.140]  And then they put this stuff together and somebody writes a script for her and she reads it and that's not journalism
[1:11:31.540 --> 1:11:36.100]  We do the investigation and when you look at this stuff, you know, she picks something like sandy hook
[1:11:36.100 --> 1:11:42.580]  It's a very complicated situation if we look at a situation like that's very easy for them to demagogue that and we don't have time
[1:11:42.980 --> 1:11:48.980]  And that certainly would not give alex time in that to talk about details and why we were concerned about the official story
[1:11:48.980 --> 1:11:53.300]  They're going to push the government's official story anybody that questions that they're simply wrong
[1:11:53.300 --> 1:11:55.300]  But that's the kind of homogenous
[1:11:56.100 --> 1:12:02.660]  Controlled news media that she and tom brawkow represent and they think that they can still do that in this day and age
[1:12:02.660 --> 1:12:07.060]  They can't everyone's got a cell phone. Everyone has a website everyone has the ability to put out information
[1:12:07.700 --> 1:12:11.140]  From ground zero where something happens as soon as breaking news happens
[1:12:11.140 --> 1:12:18.260]  We have an inside look at what's going on when something happens in Haiti. I got you on the ground. I go. Hey, what's going on here?
[1:12:18.260 --> 1:12:23.380]  This is happening boom. It's out there. You know, hey, what's going on in Paris? We got someone out there boom. We know
[1:12:23.540 --> 1:12:28.340]  We don't need to wait on them to get their script for them to tell us what they want how to fabricate the story
[1:12:28.500 --> 1:12:32.980]  We can do it boots on the ground right there every day citizens and knock it out and knock them out of the park
[1:12:33.460 --> 1:12:36.900]  And one of the things and I don't know if you want to talk about one of the things that you know
[1:12:37.220 --> 1:12:43.620]  Always we get fired up about is when we hear about human sex trafficking, you know pedophile especially especially with the youth
[1:12:43.620 --> 1:12:49.300]  They never report on that. No, even when we have the stories with with children being found in cages
[1:12:49.300 --> 1:12:53.540]  I mean, that's the kind of stuff that makes your blood boy. That's kind of stuff that you want to get on air and scream to the world
[1:12:53.540 --> 1:12:57.620]  Hey, we've got nasty pedophile people out there that are putting kids in cages, man
[1:12:57.860 --> 1:13:00.900]  Let's do something about this and then there was a story there was a raid
[1:13:01.380 --> 1:13:03.860]  I think it was actually it may have been on a un ground
[1:13:03.860 --> 1:13:07.300]  But there was a raid in Haiti where they found a bunch of kids
[1:13:07.300 --> 1:13:11.060]  They found the people that were trafficking them and this is the kind of stuff that goes in
[1:13:11.060 --> 1:13:18.580]  In places like Haiti where the infrastructures collapsed the Clinton foundation took billions of dollars did nothing for Haiti and these people are suffering
[1:13:19.220 --> 1:13:26.900]  You know, uh, a lot of your listeners were among the few Americans that actually knew about the disaster that happened in Haiti back in October
[1:13:27.460 --> 1:13:34.420]  Uh, there was a massive hurricane hurricane Matthew that went through and and it displaced a million people on this island
[1:13:34.660 --> 1:13:38.580]  They lost their the roofs of their homes their crops their sources of water
[1:13:38.580 --> 1:13:42.500]  And and it was about four weeks before the election
[1:13:42.900 --> 1:13:49.540]  And so I was watching this and and and it immediately went down there as soon as the hurricane cleared Florida
[1:13:50.100 --> 1:13:53.780]  To help these people, but I noticed that there was no mainstream media
[1:13:54.260 --> 1:13:58.340]  That was down there covering this this holocaust that happened in our own hemisphere
[1:13:58.900 --> 1:14:04.660]  So I called Alex and uh, and he grabbed Joe and Michael Zimmer and and and they went with me
[1:14:04.660 --> 1:14:07.940]  So that we could tell the world what was going on there now
[1:14:08.420 --> 1:14:13.620]  Why wasn't the media there and in the answer to that is that is that Hillary Clinton was vulnerable?
[1:14:14.020 --> 1:14:20.900]  Uh, uh just before the election because it was really common knowledge that uh, they collected over two billion dollars
[1:14:21.300 --> 1:14:28.100]  And less than two percent had gone to help the people and of course the Clinton foundation was nowhere to be found with a million people suffering
[1:14:28.100 --> 1:14:34.580]  So I thought we better get a news team down here to cover this thing so the American people can know what's going on
[1:14:34.740 --> 1:14:36.740]  He also bought a fleet of planes
[1:14:37.620 --> 1:14:42.180]  And hired pilots to come in coordinated with your via your wife who's an expert
[1:14:42.580 --> 1:14:46.020]  It coordinating logistics. I mean hold on. Yeah, Diane was
[1:14:47.380 --> 1:14:49.380]  Yeah, she kept she kept those people alive
[1:14:49.860 --> 1:14:54.020]  Uh, you you guys flew the airplanes and she was just like boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom everywhere
[1:14:54.020 --> 1:14:59.140]  It was crazy. Yeah, you know, not only were we able we were the only air evac for two of the major cities down there
[1:14:59.300 --> 1:15:05.140]  So these uh thousands of people that had been injured during the hurricane had no way to get to the hospitals in porter prints
[1:15:05.460 --> 1:15:09.300]  So when we would fly out in our cargo planes and unload the cargo and the doctors
[1:15:09.620 --> 1:15:13.780]  We would load up the planes with gurneys. Uh, I'm glad the f a wasn't there
[1:15:13.780 --> 1:15:16.820]  I mean we had literally people stacked on top of each other
[1:15:17.300 --> 1:15:22.420]  And and we would fly them back in in hospitalized them in porter prints and over the six weeks
[1:15:22.420 --> 1:15:29.780]  We were there. We literally saved dozens of lives because these people had no place to to to be treated out in the field like that
[1:15:30.420 --> 1:15:33.540]  Uh, but getting the story and and I tell you Joe you guys
[1:15:34.180 --> 1:15:37.620]  You and michael did an amazing job. This is a Pulitzer prize winning stuff
[1:15:38.180 --> 1:15:44.020]  Uh, you know, I've never seen meg and kelly do a Pulitzer prize winning story that that that uh,
[1:15:44.500 --> 1:15:50.260]  Literally save lives. I mean it was a huge you guys that's news and that was newsworthy
[1:15:50.260 --> 1:15:58.500]  And one little side incident on it is uh, uh, uh, we were discovering the tations hate the clintons because they're the haters are aware
[1:15:58.900 --> 1:16:04.820]  That the clintons have uh stolen billions of dollars from the pores to the pore in our hemisphere
[1:16:05.140 --> 1:16:10.500]  So joe interviewed me on the tarmac and uh, and I did what I call the hillary rant
[1:16:10.740 --> 1:16:15.060]  It was 34 minutes and this is eight days before the election and it went viral
[1:16:15.460 --> 1:16:17.620]  a million people and you got to think
[1:16:17.620 --> 1:16:22.980]  Uh, a million people finding out the truth about hillary clinton being a thief and a monster
[1:16:23.380 --> 1:16:28.660]  Uh influenced the 10 000 election electoral votes in michigan or in pennsylvania
[1:16:28.980 --> 1:16:34.340]  So, uh, joe, I tell you what, uh, we were a great team in Haiti and i'm really proud of what we we did there
[1:16:34.420 --> 1:16:35.620]  I mean it definitely changed my life
[1:16:35.620 --> 1:16:38.020]  I mean to see what's going on to see these people
[1:16:38.500 --> 1:16:43.620]  In pain and and the amount of help that they needed and the amount of money that was just sitting there
[1:16:43.620 --> 1:16:47.140]  Waiting to be used but you had these politicians
[1:16:47.780 --> 1:16:51.620]  Politicking in port-a-prince and some fancy restaurant over their lobster dinners
[1:16:52.020 --> 1:16:54.260]  Fighting and bickering over whose way is going to work?
[1:16:54.500 --> 1:16:58.100]  Meanwhile, nothing gets done and it takes you to fly out of Waco
[1:16:58.660 --> 1:17:02.980]  To gather people to go in there and actually make change and save lives
[1:17:02.980 --> 1:17:07.540]  I mean there was a guy who had his back broken remember that 14 year old
[1:17:07.780 --> 1:17:08.660]  Oh, yeah, it was yeah
[1:17:08.660 --> 1:17:13.380]  It was a 14 year old and the palm tree had fallen when the hurricane hit and went through the house and landed
[1:17:13.780 --> 1:17:18.100]  His mom is hacking through trees to clear out because there's no open roadways
[1:17:18.500 --> 1:17:23.940]  I mean just to hear the stories that these families went through just to get to where there was at least hope
[1:17:24.180 --> 1:17:27.700]  That a hospital had survived. I mean this is like if you look at Haiti
[1:17:27.700 --> 1:17:32.100]  There's a northern peninsula and southern peninsula and the southern peninsula was the part that was devastated the most
[1:17:32.420 --> 1:17:36.260]  These people had no road every tree was knocked over like toothpicks when we flew over
[1:17:36.260 --> 1:17:42.260]  And they had to hack through these palm trees by hand with machetes and then move a car afoot
[1:17:42.740 --> 1:17:47.220]  Hack hack hack move afoot. It took one kid seven days just to get to where we were
[1:17:47.780 --> 1:17:50.340]  And they didn't even know if they were going to a place that was just a dead end
[1:17:50.820 --> 1:17:52.980]  The hospital could have been demolished, but that was their only hope
[1:17:52.980 --> 1:17:57.780]  That's the only thing even got him through the day the mom through the day to survive to get that little boy there
[1:17:58.020 --> 1:18:03.060]  You know, and it's amazing. I actually ran into some Haitian protesters at a
[1:18:03.060 --> 1:18:09.060]  Uh presidential debate and they're standing outside and they're trying to raise awareness for how
[1:18:09.460 --> 1:18:14.980]  Hillary Clinton basically robbed them. I mean stole money from them and they're just sitting there
[1:18:14.980 --> 1:18:19.700]  And I can only imagine what it's like in Haiti. They're just sitting there like how can anybody vote for her
[1:18:20.260 --> 1:18:22.260]  Like we know this woman is a thief
[1:18:22.660 --> 1:18:26.660]  Yeah, and you can see it and they're just the fact that people would vote for them. They're so ashamed
[1:18:26.660 --> 1:18:30.740]  They're so just in awe like how could anyone vote for this devil?
[1:18:30.740 --> 1:18:35.620]  We've talked to Anzalee Donto several times talking about the corruption in Haiti
[1:18:35.860 --> 1:18:42.580]  And I think what you did is a good example of why it's voluntary association people working directly what you did
[1:18:43.060 --> 1:18:49.140]  To directly help those people rather than going to some corrupt charitable organization like Hillary Clinton's
[1:18:49.380 --> 1:18:54.020]  Foundation or even using the government because the government will do the same thing as well
[1:18:54.020 --> 1:19:00.980]  They will they will profiteer off of other people's suffering and then set on the money not really apply it well
[1:19:01.140 --> 1:19:04.820]  And that's especially true in third world countries exactly what you were talking about there
[1:19:04.820 --> 1:19:10.020]  But that's the key thing that was what made America different when Alexis de Tocqueville came to America
[1:19:10.020 --> 1:19:13.380]  He wrote his democracy in America. He said in America people
[1:19:13.940 --> 1:19:19.060]  See a problem. They come together voluntarily like you did Gary. They take care of it everywhere else
[1:19:19.140 --> 1:19:23.300]  They just they collect money for it. They steal it. They don't they don't ever solve the problem
[1:19:23.300 --> 1:19:28.260]  It's just the nature of it. Yeah, I I didn't tell you this David, but I'm on the short list for the u.s.
[1:19:28.340 --> 1:19:30.500]  Ambassadorship to Haiti. Wow. He is
[1:19:31.540 --> 1:19:38.500]  Excellent, uh, you know, not only do I have the business experience having run the 10th largest franchise company in the world in 92 countries
[1:19:39.540 --> 1:19:44.020]  But uh, and I have a degree in health and nutrition and and uh, and I'm a farmer and rancher
[1:19:44.020 --> 1:19:49.060]  So I have I cover a lot of the bases and I've been to Haiti countless times live there six weeks after the hurricane
[1:19:49.060 --> 1:19:53.060]  Uh, but is a franchise or the founder of curves
[1:19:53.860 --> 1:19:55.860]  My job my skill set was gathering
[1:19:56.820 --> 1:19:58.820]  Thousands of people with a common interest
[1:19:59.300 --> 1:20:00.900]  In bringing them together
[1:20:00.900 --> 1:20:07.060]  For one purpose and and in Haiti the greatest resource over there is the hundreds of NGOs
[1:20:07.700 --> 1:20:12.820]  There are thousands of volunteers. There are millions of dollars that are all working independently
[1:20:13.140 --> 1:20:17.220]  And so the waste and the corruption and and the barriers to accomplish it
[1:20:17.220 --> 1:20:23.620]  So if if I do get the nod and and do become the ambassador my goal is to organize those those
[1:20:24.260 --> 1:20:25.780]  massive resources
[1:20:25.780 --> 1:20:28.180]  And and help them to move in the same direction together
[1:20:28.180 --> 1:20:34.180]  So I have a great particular skill set and experience and I think that's the hope for Haiti and the other thing is is that
[1:20:34.580 --> 1:20:36.980]  Uh, uh, the u.s. influence in Haiti
[1:20:37.700 --> 1:20:39.940]  under the the the uh, clinton
[1:20:40.420 --> 1:20:42.420]  uh
[1:20:42.420 --> 1:20:43.940]  State department
[1:20:43.940 --> 1:20:45.940]  Was massively corrupt. Oh, yeah
[1:20:45.940 --> 1:20:50.660]  Uh, the current president of the president before martellie. Yeah, they rigged that election
[1:20:50.900 --> 1:20:56.420]  Yeah, and it's as blatant as can be and I don't know the whole history because I've I've made myself an expert on it
[1:20:56.900 --> 1:20:58.900]  I won't go into that but uh
[1:20:58.900 --> 1:20:59.780]  All right
[1:20:59.780 --> 1:21:02.020]  It has not been in the interest of the Haitian people
[1:21:02.580 --> 1:21:06.260]  And and I believe sending somebody like me that's not bought and paid for
[1:21:06.660 --> 1:21:09.540]  Uh, that has the courage to stand and fight
[1:21:09.940 --> 1:21:12.500]  Well, we we got to go to break but we're breaking news right now
[1:21:12.500 --> 1:21:17.460]  Gary haven on the shortlist for the ambassador to Haiti. Let's hope that that is a very short list
[1:21:17.940 --> 1:21:19.940]  Yeah, we'll be right back
[1:21:21.540 --> 1:21:24.820]  It's a no-brainer a big burkey water filter is the one you need period
[1:21:24.900 --> 1:21:27.300]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine fluoride

[1:25:35.700 --> 1:25:41.300]  Owen shroyer filling in star studded cast here today gary haven david knight and joe biggs
[1:25:41.300 --> 1:25:47.060]  And we were just discussing haiti as we left the last segment. We'll rejoin that discussion now
[1:25:47.620 --> 1:25:52.900]  More specifically talk about something that was pretty much ignored by the mainstream media as far as I can
[1:25:53.460 --> 1:25:57.460]  Could tell and you know how it goes if the mainstream media doesn't touch it. It's just a conspiracy theory
[1:25:57.620 --> 1:26:00.580]  But you brought up the name monica peterson who actually
[1:26:01.380 --> 1:26:03.380]  unfortunately
[1:26:03.460 --> 1:26:06.660]  She was deceased because of what she was doing in haiti
[1:26:06.660 --> 1:26:10.500]  Yeah, you know after I'd done my clinton rant. Thanks to joe here
[1:26:11.060 --> 1:26:17.300]  Uh, and then hillary lost. Thank god. I thought wow, you know, I may survive this
[1:26:18.180 --> 1:26:19.300]  and
[1:26:19.300 --> 1:26:22.340]  And I was at haiti when it happened a week after the election
[1:26:22.820 --> 1:26:25.380]  monica peterson, uh, who was a young woman?
[1:26:26.020 --> 1:26:28.820]  who had uh gone to haiti to investigate
[1:26:29.460 --> 1:26:33.060]  The child sex trafficking affiliation with the clinton foundation
[1:26:33.060 --> 1:26:38.900]  I I was suicided and this was the young woman who had every reason to live
[1:26:38.900 --> 1:26:40.900]  She was she was doing something purposeful
[1:26:41.460 --> 1:26:47.220]  And by the way, there's been no release of information about her death and investigation to this day
[1:26:47.940 --> 1:26:48.900]  uh
[1:26:48.900 --> 1:26:50.900]  And and so a week after the election
[1:26:52.020 --> 1:26:53.140]  people
[1:26:53.140 --> 1:26:54.660]  affiliated with
[1:26:54.660 --> 1:26:59.940]  Investigation of the clintons gets uh, suicided. I thought well, uh, maybe I need to
[1:26:59.940 --> 1:27:03.220]  Get my my head up a little bit longer
[1:27:03.780 --> 1:27:10.900]  Uh, uh, and then of course we we know that the clinton foundation had an affiliation with child sex trafficking in haiti
[1:27:11.540 --> 1:27:17.540]  Uh, uh, because of uh, uh, the laur sills of the investigation. Uh, this was a woman who who was in haiti
[1:27:18.020 --> 1:27:21.860]  who, um, uh got caught transporting children across the border
[1:27:22.420 --> 1:27:27.060]  into the dominican republic, uh, and she was arrested and uh, uh in held
[1:27:27.060 --> 1:27:34.180]  And hillary clinton and whom i've been in were we're sending emails back and forth about laur sills of it
[1:27:34.660 --> 1:27:40.980]  And and an attorney that was affiliated with the clinton foundation was sent down there to secure her release
[1:27:41.700 --> 1:27:45.220]  Uh, and of course the clintons are heavily involved in
[1:27:46.020 --> 1:27:49.940]  election fraud down there and getting their people elected. So they have a lot of influence
[1:27:50.500 --> 1:27:54.740]  Uh, I met and this has been going on since the 90s too. Oh, yeah. Yeah, it's it's uh
[1:27:54.740 --> 1:28:01.940]  Uh, uh, well at least since bush was was an office. We've now seen the the uh, uh, yeah
[1:28:02.260 --> 1:28:08.100]  You know, there's there's so much evidence of of our influence america's influence on the policy thing too here gary is
[1:28:08.500 --> 1:28:13.380]  The rich mineral resources of haiti people understand it's such a poor country. Why are they doing this?
[1:28:13.460 --> 1:28:19.940]  Well, it's a poor country because their politics, but they have a vast mineral resources. That's right. You know, uh, hillary's brother
[1:28:20.580 --> 1:28:22.580]  uh, uh
[1:28:22.580 --> 1:28:25.060]  Got the first gold lease
[1:28:25.860 --> 1:28:31.620]  In the country got it for a nominal amount of money. Uh, uh, and again, it's shocking pay to play
[1:28:32.260 --> 1:28:38.580]  Uh benefits of being associated with these people, you know, and not to change the subject, but uh, uh, this there's so much
[1:28:38.900 --> 1:28:43.540]  Evidence on pay to play whether it's uranium or or are you are you name it out there?
[1:28:44.100 --> 1:28:45.620]  uh
[1:28:45.620 --> 1:28:50.420]  Why trump doesn't understand that the best defense is a strong offense
[1:28:50.420 --> 1:28:55.780]  He should be going after these people and filling up the news cycle filling up the prisons
[1:28:56.260 --> 1:29:01.140]  And the prisons with with the with these criminals that have aligned against him right now
[1:29:01.540 --> 1:29:03.540]  And uh, I don't see that he has a choice
[1:29:03.780 --> 1:29:08.580]  And and and I tell you chief among them is pedophilia, you know what what they all have in common
[1:29:08.580 --> 1:29:14.100]  These elitists is pedophilia. You know that uh, uh, the justice department under trump has already
[1:29:14.100 --> 1:29:21.300]  Prosecuted 1,500 people right for for a pedophilia most arrests ever. I'm constantly documenting it. Yeah
[1:29:21.540 --> 1:29:24.820]  So I think that's the next big thing to to happen. We're gonna find out
[1:29:25.220 --> 1:29:28.980]  Uh, the the people in power in this country, uh, john pedesta and his
[1:29:29.940 --> 1:29:31.940]  His is weird brother
[1:29:31.940 --> 1:29:36.020]  Yeah, and you know the weird art collection. That's normal. Yeah
[1:29:37.460 --> 1:29:40.420]  I'll fontate if you look at his art collection
[1:29:40.420 --> 1:29:47.300]  Okay, and and you know any reasonable person will look at that art and say this guy is sick
[1:29:47.940 --> 1:29:50.820]  Uh, he's nuts and I don't care what other evidence you need
[1:29:51.460 --> 1:29:53.780]  You look at that and you need to ask some questions
[1:29:54.180 --> 1:29:58.020]  And you know the great thing about alex and and what I would encourage him to do
[1:29:58.500 --> 1:30:02.420]  Uh more often is to point out that he just asked him the questions that ought to be asked
[1:30:02.420 --> 1:30:11.460]  You know, he's not making his conclusions, you know, he he uh has done thousands of stories and I think he's apologized uh a dozen times
[1:30:12.100 --> 1:30:14.660]  And you know when we sit here and we aren't reading a script
[1:30:15.060 --> 1:30:21.220]  But we're thinking out loud and in and asking the questions that most americans are too afraid to ask by the way
[1:30:21.300 --> 1:30:24.900]  Right, you know, I'm not afraid. I have the courage and as an american
[1:30:24.900 --> 1:30:28.740]  I have the freedom and I think the responsibility to ask the questions
[1:30:28.740 --> 1:30:33.620]  And I don't care if I'm going to get ridiculed or shamed or lied about
[1:30:34.180 --> 1:30:37.700]  By god, I'm going to ask the questions. I'm a I'm an american
[1:30:38.020 --> 1:30:41.780]  I'm not a subject. I'm a citizen and that's what alex has done
[1:30:42.180 --> 1:30:47.060]  And I tell you what if if he's only apologized a dozen times after the thousands of stories he's done
[1:30:47.460 --> 1:30:49.700]  I would say alex has done a pretty good job, wouldn't you?
[1:30:49.940 --> 1:30:55.300]  Well, and you just take a look at the history of the stuff that alex jones would talk about 20 years ago 10 years ago
[1:30:55.300 --> 1:31:02.420]  Five years ago. It's all come true. It's all out there now samsung tv spying on you vault 7 the cia spying on everything
[1:31:02.820 --> 1:31:08.100]  Uh the clinton's and hady. I mean it just goes on and on the wiki leaks emails putting kids in the pool for your pleasure
[1:31:08.420 --> 1:31:14.260]  The uh six satanic rituals that marina abramovich goes on with these people with we'll be right back with the alex jones
[1:31:14.260 --> 1:31:17.460]  So on the other side jones and the gcn radio network
[1:31:17.460 --> 1:31:24.020]  Leftist in europe carried out 27 terror attacks in 2016
[1:31:24.180 --> 1:31:31.220]  Which debunks the claim that conservatives and libertarians represent a bigger extremist threat over 140 terrorist attacks occurred in europe last year
[1:31:31.220 --> 1:31:33.860]  And 27 of them were blamed on leftist in comparison
[1:31:33.860 --> 1:31:39.380]  Just one right-wing terror attack was recorded for the entire year 13 attacks were blamed on jihadis
[1:31:39.380 --> 1:31:43.780]  While the majority of the attacks nearly 100 were by separatist movements terrorist attacks
[1:31:43.780 --> 1:31:51.060]  Which led to deaths and injuries are almost exclusively islamic and get through advocates open borders and radical islam
[1:31:51.060 --> 1:31:56.580]  It's the left the statistics disprove the narrative that conservatives and libertarians represent a major terrorist threat
[1:31:56.580 --> 1:32:00.740]  Acclaimed the major media was pushing up through the recent attack on muslims near moscow in london
[1:32:00.740 --> 1:32:06.180]  The study came from europe hole law enforcement agency of the european union tasked with combating organized crime and terrorism
[1:32:06.180 --> 1:32:12.420]  Additionally terror experts in the u.s. Are also warning that left-wing terror represents a far bigger concern than ever before
[1:32:12.420 --> 1:32:19.780]  Which isn't surprising given how the establishment keeps promoting violence against president trump. You can find out more at info wars.com

[1:35:39.540 --> 1:35:44.340]  And actually if you're an info wars fan, you've probably noticed David Knight has been under the weather lately
[1:35:44.740 --> 1:35:49.300]  And in the breaks, he's actually doing lung cleanse and his help is it helping him helping him
[1:35:49.620 --> 1:35:53.220]  Suppress that cough that he's got. Yeah, I had done it about the top of the hour
[1:35:54.020 --> 1:35:59.060]  It made a big difference and then I didn't do it for what because I'm I still got quite a bit of bronchitis here
[1:35:59.060 --> 1:36:02.660]  And as you probably heard me coughing as Gary was talking
[1:36:02.660 --> 1:36:04.820]  I was doing my utmost to keep that under control
[1:36:04.820 --> 1:36:10.180]  But you just I just take this and they spray it on your tongue and then you breathe the vapors in all natural ingredients
[1:36:10.580 --> 1:36:15.300]  Does a great job of suppressing that urge to cough it really clears your lungs
[1:36:15.780 --> 1:36:18.980]  And when you're when you're sick like I am you're going to have to keep doing it
[1:36:19.060 --> 1:36:22.980]  but it is really really effective at that kind of uh
[1:36:23.860 --> 1:36:28.420]  You know clearing up that congestion Gary said is that stuff really working? It's like yeah, it really does work
[1:36:28.420 --> 1:36:33.380]  It really does. I mean, that's the only way Hillary Clinton was able to make it through the entire campaign cycle
[1:36:34.020 --> 1:36:36.580]  She was on lung cleanse all the time. She had like a whole rack
[1:36:37.140 --> 1:36:42.180]  We had a whole bunch of things we should have sent her but she probably would have looked at it with a kind of a side eye
[1:36:42.580 --> 1:36:45.860]  That's when she was uh birthing those demon goblins. Is that what that was?
[1:36:46.420 --> 1:36:51.060]  It was an aqua chamber specifically for birthing demon goblins into it wasn't glass water
[1:36:51.140 --> 1:36:55.700]  That was the day that she laid off the uh the lung cleanse so but seriously folks lung cleanse you can get that as well
[1:36:55.700 --> 1:37:01.620]  Free shipping everything free shipping these products actually work. I'm an avid user. I know that the rest of the crew is
[1:37:02.180 --> 1:37:03.380]  as well
[1:37:03.380 --> 1:37:08.500]  Well guys, uh all kinds of stuff still to talk about. I don't know if you want to get back into Haiti
[1:37:08.580 --> 1:37:12.100]  I know that you had some megan kelly uh comments that you wanted to make
[1:37:12.500 --> 1:37:17.540]  Let's finish up with Haiti real quick and just some of the stuff that you're working on joe or whatever you can talk about
[1:37:17.860 --> 1:37:22.020]  With um your investigation in human trafficking. Yeah, you know, we're talking about human trafficking
[1:37:22.020 --> 1:37:25.460]  Uh, you know pedophilia things like that. I mean, it's not just Haiti, you know
[1:37:26.180 --> 1:37:29.940]  There's been so many just in this year alone in australia that have been captured pedophiles
[1:37:30.100 --> 1:37:34.260]  I mean yesterday in austin and round rock. There was a guy who drove a hundred miles
[1:37:34.900 --> 1:37:36.340]  to go
[1:37:36.340 --> 1:37:39.700]  Have sex with a 13 year old girl. I mean these people are out there
[1:37:39.780 --> 1:37:41.220]  It's not just elite people
[1:37:41.220 --> 1:37:48.100]  But it's the fact that they we catch these people and we have proof and that enables and empowers other people who have these urges
[1:37:48.100 --> 1:37:51.780]  And they think they can go do it and we're not doing anything about it. Like you said during the break, too
[1:37:51.780 --> 1:37:55.380]  Craig Sawyer is a uh X navy seal who's going after
[1:37:55.940 --> 1:38:00.500]  These types of people these pedophiles and every avenue of approach he he takes to try to make
[1:38:00.980 --> 1:38:06.500]  New money to fund himself in his operation to be able to go and and expose these people it gets shut down
[1:38:06.900 --> 1:38:11.700]  You know, uh, there is an elected official right now that we are looking at with a group of my friends
[1:38:12.100 --> 1:38:17.860]  Um who goes into Juarez, Mexico right across from El Paso and is actively involved in pedophilium
[1:38:17.860 --> 1:38:20.020]  This person this elected official is seen
[1:38:20.500 --> 1:38:26.020]  Um walking the streets with 13 14 year old boys and then going back to a private home that he has
[1:38:26.420 --> 1:38:32.020]  And and nothing happens because people are scared of him because this guy's connected to the cartels and the cartels
[1:38:32.500 --> 1:38:37.780]  Use this person because he's a us elected official and they can use him to corrupt him to come over the border
[1:38:38.180 --> 1:38:43.220]  Free freely without being screwed with so there's a lot of corruption going on. It's not just in Haiti
[1:38:43.220 --> 1:38:48.980]  It's not just these elites. It's a lower level people as well. And it's really disturbing that it is
[1:38:50.100 --> 1:38:54.420]  Such a prominent thing and then when we talk about it, we're looked at as kooky
[1:38:54.660 --> 1:38:59.380]  We're looked at is like, why would you talk about that? Why wouldn't we talk about that?
[1:38:59.620 --> 1:39:04.180]  Especially when it's so obvious is that he he he wants to talk he wants to expose the public
[1:39:04.340 --> 1:39:10.100]  He's not going to go in and trample on somebody's investigation the people that are working with him. They have former they have law enforcement
[1:39:10.100 --> 1:39:13.540]  Uh, you know past and so they're not going to mess up with a
[1:39:14.340 --> 1:39:20.260]  Investigation but they want to expose this and that's why when he came on with alex talked about his crowd sourcing funding
[1:39:20.500 --> 1:39:22.500]  They shut that down within two hours
[1:39:22.580 --> 1:39:26.660]  I mean look at these people these elite people that are part of this. They don't have kids themselves
[1:39:26.980 --> 1:39:30.820]  Yeah, that's that's kind of a an odd thing. Yeah, like all the european leaders
[1:39:31.060 --> 1:39:36.100]  You have kids you have kids. I mean when you have a kid and you look at that little baby
[1:39:36.100 --> 1:39:42.500]  It it changes your life. There's no way in hell. You could ever do something so demonic so sick
[1:39:42.740 --> 1:39:46.260]  And when you see that being done it literally just makes you want to vomit
[1:39:46.500 --> 1:39:52.500]  It makes every bit of hate that you didn't even know you had come to surface because you just want to take that person and just
[1:39:53.220 --> 1:39:56.820]  Ah, you know, that's what let's not forget. You had to build a blosio staffer
[1:39:57.060 --> 1:40:00.100]  Who gets arrested with all the child porn that he had on his computer?
[1:40:00.100 --> 1:40:06.580]  This is a guy that was kind of dubbed inside of the democratic party as a rising star the next john podesta if you will and he gets
[1:40:06.580 --> 1:40:08.420]  Busted with all the child porn
[1:40:08.420 --> 1:40:11.700]  You've got anthony wiener. He gets busted sexting underage kids
[1:40:11.860 --> 1:40:18.580]  These are both people within not even within one degree of separation of the democratic party in the democratic party
[1:40:18.900 --> 1:40:23.140]  I mean, it's right there and it's not just the democrats. You've got dennis hashtar too
[1:40:23.460 --> 1:40:27.380]  So it's not just the democrats. We're not just talking about this, but it is amazing how
[1:40:27.380 --> 1:40:34.580]  They specifically groomed him so that he could become the GOP speaker and that's how blackmail works for the longest period of time
[1:40:34.900 --> 1:40:41.220]  They knew who this guy was. He's like a high school basketball coach. They groom. I think it was wrestling or wrestling. Yeah, wrestling
[1:40:41.540 --> 1:40:43.540]  Yeah, well that figures right anyway
[1:40:44.900 --> 1:40:49.460]  They uh, they they they they pick him out of that situation because they know his background
[1:40:49.780 --> 1:40:53.940]  And then they move him rapidly through the ranks and they keep him there for the longest period of time
[1:40:53.940 --> 1:40:59.620]  So we're going to continue to cover that as it's breaking and I know that I would assume
[1:40:59.700 --> 1:41:02.020]  I mean, we got to get craigsawyer back on to talk to alex
[1:41:02.100 --> 1:41:05.140]  I didn't see actually can you guys pull up that tweet that you had up a second ago
[1:41:05.540 --> 1:41:10.020]  Originally craigsawyer tweeted out that paypal had shut down his account
[1:41:10.500 --> 1:41:15.700]  And he was reaching out to paypal for comment and they were getting back to him now the new development is
[1:41:16.500 --> 1:41:18.500]  He just tweeted this morning
[1:41:18.660 --> 1:41:20.660]  Paypal apparently has taken
[1:41:21.300 --> 1:41:23.300]  $46,000
[1:41:23.300 --> 1:41:29.060]  From the organizations that he started to fight child trafficking and pedophilia
[1:41:29.620 --> 1:41:33.140]  Wow, this is a huge story. This is massive
[1:41:34.100 --> 1:41:36.660]  It's amazing how they will shut down any
[1:41:37.620 --> 1:41:42.740]  Attempt to expose what's happening. It's time to look into paypal. Yeah, I mean, it's unbelievable paypal
[1:41:42.740 --> 1:41:46.980]  Who are they connected to who's who's taking democrat money? You know, there's got to be something
[1:41:46.980 --> 1:41:49.460]  I mean why why in the hell would you be for?
[1:41:49.460 --> 1:41:53.700]  Stopping someone from going and doing that and then steal their money
[1:41:54.340 --> 1:41:58.820]  That'd be like someone showing up the Fort Lauderdale when you're about to fly to Haiti and going on a can't fly
[1:41:59.220 --> 1:42:04.980]  Yeah, so paypal is a widely used service. I myself use it and that tweet actually had an alternative
[1:42:04.980 --> 1:42:10.180]  I think it was called again pull that tweet back up guys alex karp is one of the founders of paypal along with elon musk and alex
[1:42:10.260 --> 1:42:12.580]  Yeah, musk is out though, isn't it build?
[1:42:12.580 --> 1:42:15.700]  Yeah, he's out but and and karp may be as well
[1:42:15.700 --> 1:42:22.420]  But yeah, it's a regular attendee at bill de berg and he was a guy who was running data mining services for the cia
[1:42:22.580 --> 1:42:30.660]  So apparently now it's time to ditch pedo pal for electronic transfer calm. That is in craigsaw Sawyer's tweet
[1:42:30.820 --> 1:42:36.660]  I guess I guess I'll have to do that if paypal is going to stop an investigation into child sex trafficking
[1:42:37.060 --> 1:42:40.020]  That a good american is trying to do in his own time
[1:42:40.020 --> 1:42:47.540]  Then sorry paypal can't use your services anymore. This is how the free economy works. This is how america is supposed to work
[1:42:47.700 --> 1:42:50.500]  Well, hopefully they'll refund it back to those people so those people can read well
[1:42:50.500 --> 1:42:53.140]  That's what should be going on back to electronic transfer
[1:42:53.140 --> 1:42:59.940]  I think that's the most unbelievable part of this story right now apparently $46,000 that they're just not giving back
[1:43:00.580 --> 1:43:02.580]  That is thief that is that is theft
[1:43:02.980 --> 1:43:07.780]  So I hope that craigsaw can join alex jones sometime this week to talk about that that is absolutely
[1:43:07.780 --> 1:43:14.340]  Uh huge to me and again all of these people that are looking into child sex trafficking and human trafficking going on
[1:43:15.220 --> 1:43:17.220]  within the ranks of the elites
[1:43:18.020 --> 1:43:22.980]  They run into some stumbling box. They run into some obstacles. It's amazing how that happens. You might not think it's real
[1:43:23.620 --> 1:43:26.820]  Try reporting on it for a day and see what happens to your life
[1:43:27.140 --> 1:43:33.780]  Now I want to get gary haven's comments on um the death of megan kelly. That was the alex jones interview
[1:43:33.780 --> 1:43:38.340]  Uh, the law the last spark of life. She'll probably have was that uh jones interview
[1:43:38.340 --> 1:43:41.140]  It looks like she's probably even on her way out the door of nbc lately
[1:43:41.300 --> 1:43:47.060]  But you said you had some insight that you didn't hadn't heard from anyone else. Yeah, there's there's three points
[1:43:47.060 --> 1:43:54.820]  I'd like to make about this. Uh, uh, the first one where alex fortunately recorded the uh pre interview where
[1:43:55.620 --> 1:43:58.580]  She practically prostituted herself
[1:43:58.580 --> 1:44:04.180]  Uh, you know to praise him on on admiring him and so forth
[1:44:04.580 --> 1:44:06.580]  Uh, uh, that was so sick
[1:44:07.220 --> 1:44:13.060]  And the idea that that she thought she could trick uh to smooth alex into that interview
[1:44:13.540 --> 1:44:16.660]  Uh, just just shows how out of touch she is with reality
[1:44:17.140 --> 1:44:22.980]  Uh, so I thought that was a really fascinating part of it. So and of course alex, uh knew exactly what it was doing
[1:44:23.380 --> 1:44:26.340]  Uh, you know, sometimes you've got to stand in the line of fire
[1:44:26.340 --> 1:44:33.300]  And uh, uh, I think alex went into it fully aware that he was gonna, you know, take some hits over this thing
[1:44:33.700 --> 1:44:38.340]  After all they did four hours of filming and I think alex had five minutes of face time
[1:44:38.660 --> 1:44:43.540]  So let me tell you what you can do an awful lot of creative editing to to to go from four hours to
[1:44:44.580 --> 1:44:47.060]  To five minutes, but alex knew that in advance
[1:44:47.620 --> 1:44:50.340]  um, uh, the good news is is that uh
[1:44:50.900 --> 1:44:54.900]  Uh, it looked like the only people to actually watch the show where alex's fans
[1:44:54.900 --> 1:44:56.900]  Yeah, uh, yeah, even uh
[1:44:57.540 --> 1:45:03.300]  Uh, and she'd already done a hit piece on him like that with creative editing and kudos to shon hannity for calling her out on it
[1:45:03.300 --> 1:45:08.580]  Say show the entire interview regardless of what you think show the entire interview and be honest about it
[1:45:08.580 --> 1:45:14.180]  We don't need to have a fake editing news and that's precisely what you want to do and you talk about face time
[1:45:14.820 --> 1:45:17.460]  The the fact that they would light him that way, you know, oh
[1:45:17.620 --> 1:45:19.700]  There's some way that we the same thing we saw with that time
[1:45:19.700 --> 1:45:24.820]  I think it was time or newsweek the cover that they did with uh, john mccain. I've never been a john mccain fan
[1:45:25.140 --> 1:45:31.300]  But when they lit him from underneath like some universal monster, you know, the old that's accurate though
[1:45:31.300 --> 1:45:37.460]  Yeah, that that I can accept that lighting because that's actually I think they let him just fine. That's just how yeah, that's right
[1:45:38.580 --> 1:45:39.620]  He needs it
[1:45:39.620 --> 1:45:43.540]  We need to start coming back in with the uh, the uh empire theme from star wars
[1:45:43.540 --> 1:45:47.380]  Just to give that a little justice that lighting that they had but you know, I actually over the top
[1:45:47.380 --> 1:45:52.340]  You know what they're trying to do. Yeah, I actually had a moment with megan though that to me
[1:45:54.740 --> 1:45:58.180]  No, no, no, yeah, she she cut that one from the interview but no but uh
[1:45:59.300 --> 1:46:05.540]  I said I I made a reference in the interview when she was trying to demonize me, uh, you know for not being a real journalist
[1:46:06.580 --> 1:46:08.580]  I looked her and I said megan
[1:46:08.660 --> 1:46:13.380]  You know people don't need a 15 million dollar a year contract to trust that someone's a journalist
[1:46:13.380 --> 1:46:18.980]  They don't care they don't they don't need to see your big salary and your big stage out there to be considered a journalist
[1:46:19.300 --> 1:46:25.300]  And she kind of took that personally and she was like she was like, you know, you don't have to berate people for making money
[1:46:25.300 --> 1:46:26.740]  You know making money isn't a bad thing
[1:46:26.740 --> 1:46:30.900]  You don't have to attack me just because I you know and making a lot of money and I was like megan
[1:46:31.460 --> 1:46:33.220]  You missed the point entirely
[1:46:33.220 --> 1:46:35.380]  I uh, I have no problem with people making money
[1:46:35.380 --> 1:46:39.860]  In fact, I think the bastardization of rich people of the left is part of the problem
[1:46:39.860 --> 1:46:43.780]  They want to demonize anybody who wants to make money. No, no, no, that's not what I was saying to megan
[1:46:43.940 --> 1:46:48.260]  What I was trying to explain megan and this just echoes what you're saying how they really just don't get it
[1:46:48.660 --> 1:46:52.260]  She really thinks that because she has the big contract
[1:46:52.580 --> 1:46:56.340]  She really thinks that because she has the big NBC logo behind her
[1:46:56.980 --> 1:47:00.020]  And and probably even beyond that she probably just doesn't care
[1:47:00.100 --> 1:47:03.060]  She's probably just in it for the money. Anyway, not even a real journalist
[1:47:03.060 --> 1:47:06.820]  That's a fake journalist someone that's in it for the money not actually getting truth out there
[1:47:06.820 --> 1:47:10.420]  But it really sunk into me. She's sitting here trying to back up her point
[1:47:10.660 --> 1:47:14.020]  Like oh, don't come after me because I make a lot of money. It's like no you missed the point
[1:47:14.020 --> 1:47:18.100]  You think you're legitimate because you make a lot of money people don't buy that anymore
[1:47:18.500 --> 1:47:19.700]  That's the entire point
[1:47:19.700 --> 1:47:24.820]  But I think that she either doesn't get that or she just reports whatever they tell her to say because she makes money
[1:47:24.820 --> 1:47:26.500]  Really like me
[1:47:26.500 --> 1:47:29.220]  Well, you know one of the things that came out in that that pre-interview
[1:47:29.620 --> 1:47:35.460]  A conversation that she had with alex that that he released is the idea that in their minds
[1:47:35.460 --> 1:47:38.420]  There's these different echelons of news. Okay, so
[1:47:39.380 --> 1:47:43.780]  There there are those of us that they consider to be bottom feeders and and not real news
[1:47:43.780 --> 1:47:47.380]  And then there's cable news and then there's network news
[1:47:47.940 --> 1:47:51.540]  And she had made that leap to network news and when you watch the
[1:47:52.180 --> 1:47:54.820]  Ryan Williams he said they did. Yeah, we remember brian
[1:47:54.900 --> 1:47:59.380]  But when you look at what she did with tom broke out and the way she presented all this stuff
[1:47:59.460 --> 1:48:02.740]  It was so low energy. Yeah, it was so
[1:48:02.740 --> 1:48:06.500]  So boring those war that that was the key that there was absolutely no energy
[1:48:06.740 --> 1:48:10.900]  You can see her eyes dotting back and forth reading the teleprompter
[1:48:11.300 --> 1:48:15.300]  Not even with any expression or inflection in her voice
[1:48:15.700 --> 1:48:20.340]  It was just wooden and that's the key thing and the same thing with tom broke out
[1:48:20.340 --> 1:48:24.740]  He was watching this. I was like, I know exactly what I'm going to use now when I can't fall asleep
[1:48:25.780 --> 1:48:27.620]  It was like well today in new zealand
[1:48:27.620 --> 1:48:33.460]  We're going to go talk to sam neal from jurassic bark and he makes wine stay tuned. They're like, who cares?
[1:48:33.700 --> 1:48:34.980]  Well, and you're sitting here. Oh my god
[1:48:34.980 --> 1:48:38.260]  We just went from an intense saying where you know you do a hit piece
[1:48:38.740 --> 1:48:43.460]  On alex and then you don't even like air any of it and you're like well today. We're going to talk about wine now
[1:48:43.780 --> 1:48:47.700]  We're really getting interested and that's what i'm saying too. She spends the entire day with alex
[1:48:47.940 --> 1:48:49.940]  She knows that the portrayer
[1:48:50.020 --> 1:48:53.300]  Portrayer of alex during that show is completely inaccurate
[1:48:53.540 --> 1:48:57.060]  But she goes along with it anyway, and i'm just saying she's like how can you read?
[1:48:57.060 --> 1:49:02.100]  How can you read that for the script? You know, they read their script to put all the b-roll overs like how can you read that?
[1:49:02.100 --> 1:49:06.740]  And then again, it hits me. She's not even think she's literally thinking dollars. That's all i'm rich
[1:49:06.900 --> 1:49:09.540]  I'm on the network. Yeah, I mean if you're a real journalist
[1:49:09.540 --> 1:49:13.380]  She would go into that job with a contract saying you know what this is the story
[1:49:13.380 --> 1:49:16.900]  I want to cover. I want to have finals say over what goes out. That's not what that's not her job
[1:49:17.300 --> 1:49:19.700]  And she's just like well i'll take that page. I can i'll read this right here
[1:49:19.780 --> 1:49:21.860]  Exactly because if she was a real journalist
[1:49:22.100 --> 1:49:25.220]  She would have come here and done a profile on alex jones and been like wow
[1:49:25.220 --> 1:49:30.820]  You talked about this 10 years ago. It came true. You talked about cameras in the phones and the tv's it came true
[1:49:30.980 --> 1:49:35.140]  People make fun of you for gay frogs. Well, that's true too. That's what a real journalist would have done
[1:49:35.300 --> 1:49:38.020]  That was a total hit piece anything else you wanted to add gary?
[1:49:38.180 --> 1:49:42.020]  Yeah, there was one more thing that I think was uh, it was really kind of overlooked on this
[1:49:42.580 --> 1:49:43.780]  uh
[1:49:43.780 --> 1:49:47.780]  The the the person that took the greatest hit was not alex
[1:49:48.340 --> 1:49:53.540]  Uh, it was president trump. Mm-hmm. This was megan's signature her signal to the
[1:49:53.540 --> 1:49:56.260]  Anti trump people to the impeach trump people
[1:49:56.660 --> 1:50:02.500]  Uh, she went after trump. I I didn't count the minutes, but I bet there was more airtime on on the house
[1:50:02.980 --> 1:50:09.380]  trump is an idiot because of his association in believing this it was trump cutting in
[1:50:09.620 --> 1:50:15.700]  Because of your report because my report a real a real report on the border in the next real journalism
[1:50:15.780 --> 1:50:20.100]  You broke a story with this guy this reporter. He's out there and there's drugs coming across
[1:50:20.100 --> 1:50:25.700]  You know, like this is why we need a border and she's like, this is the guy that's taking information and reports
[1:50:26.340 --> 1:50:31.140]  He's taking him from alex jones because of this. We don't even know what's coming across the border. Yeah, megan
[1:50:31.300 --> 1:50:32.900]  We're smuggling
[1:50:32.900 --> 1:50:40.100]  Pinatas they're risking a lot of him to get teddy bears across the border. Yeah, because yeah, I mean I actually you know what I heard
[1:50:40.100 --> 1:50:42.900]  It was I heard they were smuggling cofefe across the border
[1:50:44.980 --> 1:50:47.460]  Better watch out. Yeah, every time I cross the border illegally
[1:50:47.460 --> 1:50:50.180]  I just jump into an SUV and speed off because
[1:50:51.380 --> 1:50:55.380]  And you always have your burlap bags, too, right? Yeah, a little little flotation device
[1:50:55.540 --> 1:51:01.700]  Yeah, so there you are a real journalist breaking a story putting your life on the line for that story to break
[1:51:02.100 --> 1:51:04.100]  And then she tries to demonize that
[1:51:04.180 --> 1:51:08.340]  It's unbelievable. I was kind of shocked. I was I was sitting over daren's house actually on father's day
[1:51:08.740 --> 1:51:12.500]  And my phone starts blowing up like hey man, she's like going after your border report
[1:51:12.580 --> 1:51:14.980]  I'm like which one and then I eventually I find out I'm like
[1:51:14.980 --> 1:51:16.980]  Really? I mean that
[1:51:17.220 --> 1:51:20.580]  That and see it was even played in local news. It was played all over
[1:51:20.660 --> 1:51:24.660]  It's like we have the footage and you've done multiple reports from the border where you get hardcore footage
[1:51:24.740 --> 1:51:30.260]  I just thought it was funny somebody should have asked Tom Brokow about the Richard Jewel reports that they did because you know
[1:51:30.260 --> 1:51:34.340]  Of course, NBC and CNN got sued for that. They had an undisclosed settlement about that
[1:51:34.420 --> 1:51:36.820]  But of course, nobody talked about that
[1:51:37.380 --> 1:51:39.780]  But to use that report real journalism
[1:51:40.100 --> 1:51:41.700]  photography there and say
[1:51:41.700 --> 1:51:47.140]  Donald Trump saw this and said look they're smuggling which people could clearly see what was happening with that
[1:51:47.620 --> 1:51:51.940]  That shows the desperation and the failed narrative of these people
[1:51:52.180 --> 1:51:54.180]  They have been able to get away with this
[1:51:54.420 --> 1:51:56.020]  All of our lives haven't they Gary?
[1:51:56.020 --> 1:52:00.820]  You know, we grew up under this where they had just three networks and they controlled all the information you're going to get
[1:52:00.900 --> 1:52:04.820]  But that's why they're failing because they they show the public this video go back to the video
[1:52:04.980 --> 1:52:08.180]  You can see the people smuggling the drugs. They say nothing to see here
[1:52:08.180 --> 1:52:13.220]  No drugs being smuggled and the average American is like why are you lying to me? I have eyes
[1:52:13.460 --> 1:52:16.900]  I have common sense. I have discernment. That's why they're losing
[1:52:16.900 --> 1:52:21.300]  You cannot pull the wool over our eyes any longer more on the Alex Jones show on the other side
[1:52:21.780 --> 1:52:24.180]  Diabetes I have blood pressure anxiety meds

[1:56:27.460 --> 1:56:34.100]  Well, we are going to take a little twist and talk about the fake russia collusion story how the mainstream media is trying to
[1:56:34.740 --> 1:56:40.020]  Build trump as a russian agent to distract from the real crimes and the real collusions of the democrats
[1:56:40.660 --> 1:56:42.740]  In fact, do you guys have that tom cotton clip?
[1:56:42.740 --> 1:56:49.780]  This is an amazing clip. I want to start the conversation. We're about to have off with this clip of tom cotton today talking to jay johnson
[1:56:50.740 --> 1:56:52.740]  pre-step
[1:56:52.740 --> 1:56:54.740]  um in response to
[1:56:54.740 --> 1:56:56.740]  mr. Heinrich's question about whether
[1:56:56.740 --> 1:57:04.740]  Donald trump had become an unwitting agent of russia and that their efforts to sow discord and discontent about our elections you
[1:57:04.740 --> 1:57:10.740]  Said that you declined to answer which is understandable. Let's look at this from a different perspective
[1:57:10.740 --> 1:57:16.900]  Since her election defeat. Hillary clinton had bled has blamed her loss on the russians
[1:57:17.060 --> 1:57:21.700]  latimer putin the fbi jim comey fake news wiki leaks twitter facebook and my personal favorite
[1:57:22.260 --> 1:57:24.900]  Content farms in massedonia. Don't forget pepe
[1:57:26.340 --> 1:57:27.460]  in
[1:57:27.460 --> 1:57:29.460]  Her blaming her loss on these
[1:57:30.020 --> 1:57:35.300]  Actors for clinton becoming an unwitting agent of russians goals in the united states
[1:57:35.300 --> 1:57:44.420]  And i'm sorry sir, but it'd rather not come in. It's just something. It's just something i haven't given look at it from two different
[1:57:44.420 --> 1:57:48.100]  Any thoughts too. So let's turn to other matters again. So there's tom cotton basically saying
[1:57:48.980 --> 1:57:53.700]  Hillary clinton being a sore loser is playing right into everything that you're talking about here
[1:57:55.380 --> 1:58:00.740]  It was just amazing to see all of the nonsense that goes on when you have the evidence
[1:58:00.740 --> 1:58:04.740]  It's it's just like the seth rich thing gary haven is chomping at the bit to talk about seth rich
[1:58:05.540 --> 1:58:06.660]  okay
[1:58:06.660 --> 1:58:12.740]  We have no evidence literally nothing to prove that it's russia that released the dnc emails
[1:58:13.140 --> 1:58:16.820]  Nothing to prove that russia is trying to meddle in our elections literally nothing
[1:58:17.220 --> 1:58:21.540]  Literally we have zero and you've got a slew of evidence that would say, hmm
[1:58:21.540 --> 1:58:25.620]  Maybe seth rich was murdered by somebody who was trying to hide evidence with the dnc
[1:58:25.620 --> 1:58:30.020]  Uh investigation that is or the dnc lawsuit that's ongoing
[1:58:30.820 --> 1:58:31.860]  and
[1:58:31.860 --> 1:58:33.860]  We're still sitting here wasting time
[1:58:34.180 --> 1:58:39.140]  All day long with these hearings talking about russia collusion that never happened with no evidence
[1:58:39.620 --> 1:58:43.780]  And and i'm the reason why gary haven't is chomping at the bit because there is so much evidence on the other side
[1:58:43.860 --> 1:58:48.980]  That it was seth rich that leaked the emails to wiki leaks not and even if it wasn't
[1:58:49.300 --> 1:58:54.980]  There's other reasons to think that seth rich might have wanted people wanted him to be silent when they're trying to claim that
[1:58:54.980 --> 1:58:59.540]  They're probing all of these voter logs that seth rich would have known about what do you think gary?
[1:59:00.260 --> 1:59:03.460]  Well, there's several interesting things that have happened in the last few days
[1:59:03.940 --> 1:59:07.300]  I uh without jumping here because I think this is related
[1:59:08.100 --> 1:59:10.660]  stanford released a study stanford university
[1:59:11.300 --> 1:59:15.860]  Uh, they went out to three hundred and thirty three polling sites during the democratic primaries
[1:59:16.420 --> 1:59:22.100]  And they polled people before they voted and and then they looked at the actual votes afterwards
[1:59:22.100 --> 1:59:26.180]  This is stanford guys. This isn't a conservative bastion here
[1:59:26.740 --> 1:59:31.460]  Uh, and what they found was was that the pre polling uh on hillary versus bernie
[1:59:32.020 --> 1:59:34.980]  Where there were paper ballots, uh, we're right on the money
[1:59:35.780 --> 1:59:37.780]  but those election
[1:59:38.180 --> 1:59:44.420]  Sites that used electronic voting machines consistently showed a nine percent advantage
[1:59:44.900 --> 1:59:47.380]  For for for clinton or six percent
[1:59:47.380 --> 1:59:49.380]  So
[1:59:50.420 --> 1:59:55.540]  So the key thing is that they don't have exit polling and we see that with the elections like in brazil
[1:59:55.540 --> 2:00:02.020]  They shut down exit polling. So and who had the access to that information seth rich ding ding ding ding
[2:00:02.260 --> 2:00:06.420]  It's unbelievable folks at all ties together. But hey, you know what? We're just fake journalists here
[2:00:06.420 --> 2:00:09.780]  We just actually do our job connect the dots and then report on it because we're not cowards
[2:00:09.860 --> 2:00:11.940]  We'll be right back with more of the alex joneshow third hour

[2:01:22.820 --> 2:01:26.740]  I've been everywhere, man. I've been everywhere, man
[2:01:27.060 --> 2:01:30.900]  Across the desert spare, man. I breathe the mountain air, man
[2:01:31.140 --> 2:01:34.820]  I travel like I had my share, man. I've been everywhere
[2:01:34.820 --> 2:01:39.220]  The world is a dangerous place not because of evil
[2:01:39.620 --> 2:01:46.420]  But because of those who look on and do nothing from the front lines of the information war
[2:01:46.980 --> 2:01:48.980]  It's alex jones
[2:01:49.060 --> 2:01:53.300]  You know the angle and the development that I was following in the seth rich thing was
[2:01:53.620 --> 2:02:00.340]  Jared beck the attorney that just requested that the judge hearing the dnc class action lawsuit provide protection
[2:02:00.340 --> 2:02:05.220]  To the witnesses and to the people involved in that case because of the three untimely deaths
[2:02:05.700 --> 2:02:10.980]  Revolving around it. Then you had this study that came out that joe bigs talked about earlier that said that this
[2:02:11.540 --> 2:02:12.980]  Actually appears to be a hit job
[2:02:12.980 --> 2:02:19.940]  This appears to be a serial killer that killed seth rich and not a botch robbery and now gary haven you have another angle that you want to get to
[2:02:20.340 --> 2:02:23.940]  Yeah, you know, I was uh on the phone to the governor of texas monday
[2:02:24.500 --> 2:02:29.220]  and ask him if he had heard about the the voting fraud that's been going on with the
[2:02:29.220 --> 2:02:30.020]  uh
[2:02:30.020 --> 2:02:32.580]  electronic voting machines and he had not which
[2:02:33.460 --> 2:02:38.660]  I'm not surprised because the mainstream media failed to cover this the story and we know the reason for that
[2:02:38.820 --> 2:02:40.820]  You know that this is that
[2:02:41.780 --> 2:02:43.060]  uh
[2:02:43.060 --> 2:02:45.620]  team that's aligned against us freedom seekers that
[2:02:46.420 --> 2:02:47.540]  Control the message
[2:02:47.540 --> 2:02:53.460]  But yeah, I was really neat to be able to introduce that to the governor because he's in a position to actually do something about it here in texas
[2:02:53.700 --> 2:02:57.700]  And by the way, I looked it up. It was a nine percent advantage to hillary
[2:02:57.700 --> 2:03:00.660]  Uh, uh any time they use electronic voting machines
[2:03:00.660 --> 2:03:05.860]  And if you look at the owners of the companies that uh that operate these electronic voting machines
[2:03:06.340 --> 2:03:10.580]  Many of them affiliated with the democratic donors and george horris himself. So
[2:03:11.300 --> 2:03:16.420]  But we're not doing it. We're allowing our votes to be counted by probable rigged
[2:03:18.500 --> 2:03:21.940]  Electronic machines. So hopefully the governor is going to do something about this
[2:03:21.940 --> 2:03:27.380]  As a matter of fact, he's I sent him your article and he's going to send it to the secretary state whose job is to uh,
[2:03:27.940 --> 2:03:33.380]  Uh, uh, to make sure voting in the state is we have tried to interview him multiple times big issue in texas
[2:03:33.460 --> 2:03:39.700]  Law does on that they're breaking the law shut down the ability to do a paper trail backup of that which breaks the law
[2:03:39.860 --> 2:03:43.140]  Yeah, he broke the law to shut that down. So he's specifically
[2:03:43.700 --> 2:03:48.340]  Uh, you the texas said we're not going to have electronic voting unless we can have this paper trail
[2:03:48.340 --> 2:03:54.820]  And he shut that down. So he needs to be aware of that. Well, I bet you now that he's seeing the Stanford study, which is
[2:03:55.780 --> 2:04:01.540]  Conclusive, uh, these machines cheat and they cheat to the benefit of the people that own the companies
[2:04:01.860 --> 2:04:07.140]  And we live in what we call a free society. This is insane. So this takes us back to sith rich
[2:04:07.540 --> 2:04:14.660]  Uh, his job with the dnc was to to uh, support, uh, voting sites and drive people in there
[2:04:14.660 --> 2:04:20.660]  And of course, he was a big barney sanders fan and uh, uh, and it's evident that he discovered that
[2:04:21.300 --> 2:04:23.300]  Hillary was cheating
[2:04:23.540 --> 2:04:30.340]  To the disadvantage of his chosen candidate and he was a passionate young man a man with integrity
[2:04:30.820 --> 2:04:33.540]  Uh, uh, and then suddenly in the middle of the night, uh
[2:04:34.740 --> 2:04:37.140]  He's murdered. I think he was shot in the back twice
[2:04:37.700 --> 2:04:39.060]  and uh
[2:04:39.060 --> 2:04:44.260]  And he still has his uh jewelry and his watches and died at the hospital though that we don't know which one
[2:04:44.260 --> 2:04:50.020]  He was at. Yeah, and after the the police, uh, he had taken him there with him talking and alert
[2:04:50.340 --> 2:04:54.740]  A lot of suspicion around this. They called it armed robbery. Yeah, usually you rob something after
[2:04:55.460 --> 2:04:57.460]  Afterwards and we know that other than life
[2:04:57.460 --> 2:05:00.100]  We know that it was not an armed robbery because he wasn't robbed
[2:05:00.420 --> 2:05:04.420]  Uh, but what came out today and you can find this on I think it's on dredge dredge report
[2:05:04.820 --> 2:05:09.540]  Uh, is a is a study that was done by a group of grad students in in washington dc
[2:05:10.020 --> 2:05:13.700]  At one of the universities there and they wanted to go back and look at the evidence
[2:05:13.700 --> 2:05:15.700]  And they uh without any
[2:05:16.740 --> 2:05:18.660]  lack of objectivity
[2:05:18.660 --> 2:05:22.420]  They determined uh several things that he was murdered. It was not a robbery
[2:05:22.820 --> 2:05:31.540]  Uh that he was uh either murdered by a professional because the the cleanup at the crime crime scene was so so clear
[2:05:32.100 --> 2:05:34.500]  Uh, uh, so it's not a random homicide
[2:05:35.060 --> 2:05:42.660]  Uh, uh, the the third thing is that uh, uh, it was either done by an individual professional or by a serial killer
[2:05:42.660 --> 2:05:49.060]  Now I didn't think much of that but joe you had a comment on that. I I I do believe the uh, the serial killer uh story because
[2:05:49.780 --> 2:05:55.380]  You know, uh, hillary clinton vince foster. I mean she is there's a clinton body count
[2:05:55.460 --> 2:05:57.540]  I think she's a serial killer quite frankly
[2:05:57.540 --> 2:06:03.220]  So I do kind of go with that whole that whole scenario that a serial killer did in fact stop it the clinton body count
[2:06:03.300 --> 2:06:06.500]  That's just a coincidence. Yeah, let me finish with one more quick point
[2:06:06.500 --> 2:06:14.820]  Uh, uh, the the brad bowman who was hired by this by the seth rich family is a democratic hitman who goes out and
[2:06:15.380 --> 2:06:16.420]  covers messes
[2:06:16.420 --> 2:06:21.620]  Now they don't want us talking about this because it's not sensitive to the rich family. Well guys, I'm sorry
[2:06:21.700 --> 2:06:25.060]  Leftist and Europe carried out 27 terror attacks in 2016
[2:06:25.220 --> 2:06:29.380]  Which debunks a claim that conservatives and libertarians represent a bigger extremist threat
[2:06:29.460 --> 2:06:35.220]  Over 140 terrorist attacks occurred in Europe last year and 27 of them were blamed on leftist in comparison
[2:06:35.220 --> 2:06:38.420]  Just one right-wing terror attack was recorded for the entire year
[2:06:38.500 --> 2:06:43.780]  13 attacks were blamed on jihadis while the majority of the attacks nearly 100 were by separatist movements
[2:06:44.020 --> 2:06:51.460]  terrorist attacks which led to deaths and injuries are almost exclusively islamic and gets who advocates open borders and radical islam
[2:06:51.700 --> 2:06:57.140]  It's the left the statistics disprove the narrative that conservatives and libertarians represent a major terrorist threat
[2:06:57.300 --> 2:07:01.220]  I claim the major media was pushing it through the recent attack on muslims near moscow london
[2:07:01.220 --> 2:07:06.820]  The study came from europe hole law enforcement agency of the european union tasked with combating organized crime and terrorism
[2:07:06.980 --> 2:07:12.740]  Additionally terror experts in the u.s. Are also warning that left-wing terror represents a far bigger concern than ever before
[2:07:12.900 --> 2:07:19.700]  Which isn't surprising given how the establishment keeps promoting violence against president trump. You can find out more at info wars dot com
[2:07:19.940 --> 2:07:21.540]  This is kit daniels reporting

[2:09:34.740 --> 2:09:48.740]  You're listening to the alex joneshow
[2:09:48.980 --> 2:09:53.940]  Welcome back to the alex joneshow olyn shroyer filling in gary haven david night joe biggs alongside
[2:09:54.820 --> 2:10:00.260]  And we were just talking about a lot of the red flags that are going up around the dnc the democrat party
[2:10:00.260 --> 2:10:06.180]  Seth rich and the murder investigation and gary you were just breaking down the brad bowman angle
[2:10:07.060 --> 2:10:11.700]  Yeah, you know the media is not covering the seth rich and they're actually shaming people
[2:10:12.340 --> 2:10:16.580]  Like you guys that are covering it. They're saying it's insensitive to the family
[2:10:17.380 --> 2:10:18.500]  but
[2:10:18.500 --> 2:10:20.260]  Why did the family
[2:10:20.260 --> 2:10:25.620]  Who by the way claims they have no money to hire a private investigator somebody paid for that private investigator by the way
[2:10:26.260 --> 2:10:28.420]  uh, but they also have a spokesperson
[2:10:28.420 --> 2:10:33.620]  And brad bowman is a spokesperson and if you google him, you'll find that he has run a
[2:10:34.340 --> 2:10:36.340]  a democratic
[2:10:36.660 --> 2:10:39.380]  Kind of a hitman to to cover up media
[2:10:39.940 --> 2:10:41.940]  Issues around the democratic party
[2:10:42.500 --> 2:10:45.060]  Of all people to hire is a spokesperson
[2:10:45.700 --> 2:10:49.140]  Why would you go to the dnc hitman and that's very very suspicious?
[2:10:49.780 --> 2:10:52.820]  And without being insensitive to the seth rich family
[2:10:52.820 --> 2:11:00.100]  Uh, I would say look if you're gonna hire a professional dnc hitman then you need to be prepared to to
[2:11:00.500 --> 2:11:05.380]  Have people take a closer look at this and and uh, you know, I'm sorry about the loss of your son
[2:11:05.380 --> 2:11:09.140]  in fact, uh, uh, I feel great sympathy because I think he was a
[2:11:09.700 --> 2:11:10.980]  truth seeker
[2:11:10.980 --> 2:11:16.260]  Uh, and and it you know who had means motive and opportunity. I've gone through this before
[2:11:17.060 --> 2:11:20.980]  Yeah, and exactly when those turn buddy Michael Hastings was killed and all of a sudden the
[2:11:20.980 --> 2:11:25.700]  The the narrative change in the family that wanted to look into it all of a sudden new people were answering the phone
[2:11:26.100 --> 2:11:27.060]  Leave it alone
[2:11:27.060 --> 2:11:32.580]  And then when he talked about it, megan kelly goes, oh, you're just a kooky conspiracy theory, uh, theorists bigs and you know
[2:11:32.580 --> 2:11:37.140]  This is just ridiculous say he hit a tree and then the engine flew down the road the other way 100
[2:11:37.220 --> 2:11:43.620]  Totally natural, you know, and there was there was another lady. I can't think of her name, but she had uh her her son
[2:11:43.620 --> 2:11:49.620]  I think it was what she believes her son was murdered for walking into a cocaine drug deal in
[2:11:49.620 --> 2:11:54.820]  Arkansas that she thinks bill clinton's people had something to do with and she reached out to the seth rich family
[2:11:54.820 --> 2:11:56.660]  Because she was in the similar place
[2:11:56.660 --> 2:12:00.580]  She thought that her son was witness to something bigger and that's why they had to kill her son
[2:12:00.820 --> 2:12:05.860]  But all of a sudden there was waves of people saying we're gonna help you waves of people saying we'll handle this for you
[2:12:05.860 --> 2:12:09.220]  Waves of people they trusted them. They thought that they were in it for the right reasons
[2:12:09.540 --> 2:12:13.940]  Well, she quickly realized that wasn't the case and she reached out to the rich family said look
[2:12:14.260 --> 2:12:16.900]  I know that there's a bunch of people coming out you saying they're gonna help
[2:12:16.900 --> 2:12:21.380]  I know that you're in a very vulnerable situation. I realize that you need all the help you can get
[2:12:21.380 --> 2:12:25.060]  But do not trust these people they do not have your best interests in mind
[2:12:25.140 --> 2:12:29.780]  And I think that you're saying that brad bowman is the exact type of person she was talking about
[2:12:29.860 --> 2:12:34.580]  Yeah, and unfortunately they've uh signed him up is is the family spokesperson
[2:12:34.980 --> 2:12:42.020]  And of course what he's doing is saying this is insensitive and uh, you know, you shouldn't be subjecting the family to this
[2:12:42.020 --> 2:12:43.860]  You know let the police handle it
[2:12:43.860 --> 2:12:46.980]  Well, the the problem with that is first of all who he is
[2:12:47.460 --> 2:12:50.900]  Uh, I I have no intention of trusting his his wisdom
[2:12:51.380 --> 2:12:55.540]  Uh, you know, we don't want to speculate on why the family complied and took him on
[2:12:56.020 --> 2:13:00.180]  Uh, uh, whether it's fear or or whatever. Maybe they've convinced him of something
[2:13:00.580 --> 2:13:07.620]  Maybe they hadn't said anything. It's he's been given the opportunity to use that as a strategy to shut the media reports down
[2:13:07.700 --> 2:13:12.660]  He's like the harvey kytel the guy that like the sopranos use it. Hey, I got this. Uh, we got a body
[2:13:12.660 --> 2:13:15.780]  I need you to come in and clean it up. Hey, and and keep in mind too
[2:13:15.860 --> 2:13:20.820]  The only mainstream media that was touching this at all was Sean Hannity and yeah
[2:13:21.060 --> 2:13:25.060]  And so Sean Hannity covers it asks the questions that need to be asked Sean Hannity
[2:13:25.140 --> 2:13:31.140]  I think day in day out just comes out as more of an honest, uh, a person a real a real individual in the media
[2:13:31.940 --> 2:13:33.460]  And he's talking about it
[2:13:33.460 --> 2:13:38.020]  And then he gets actually contacted by the rich family asking to shut it down
[2:13:38.420 --> 2:13:40.260]  And now he hasn't talked about it ever again
[2:13:40.260 --> 2:13:46.180]  So that's another weird aspect about this to me because that was one thing that meg and kelly was I think trying to uh
[2:13:46.740 --> 2:13:54.420]  To to to get me on was the seth rich thing and I said to her I was like look seth riches family has not contacted me
[2:13:54.820 --> 2:13:59.940]  Nobody has said stop looking into this the last time I heard from seth riches family was in a video
[2:13:59.940 --> 2:14:05.380]  They put out on twitter saying we appreciate the people doing the independent investigations. Well, I tell you there's still
[2:14:05.620 --> 2:14:08.820]  There's still a lot of big-name journalists out there working angles
[2:14:08.820 --> 2:14:12.100]  They're just doing it all they can't give it up because it's because it's so huge
[2:14:12.260 --> 2:14:17.460]  It's so obvious. Yeah any journalist worth their weight and salt would be digging into this thing
[2:14:17.620 --> 2:14:21.460]  Oh, they are they're doing it off-camera because like you said you do it on the mainstream
[2:14:22.340 --> 2:14:26.740]  They get shut down. They get sued all that stuff, but these guys i'm telling you there's some big-name people out there
[2:14:27.060 --> 2:14:29.940]  I've talked to emailed they're doing it on their own
[2:14:30.180 --> 2:14:34.500]  They've got collaboration of people and people from all different times
[2:14:34.500 --> 2:14:39.620]  You know why you you really know why despite what the they tried to do with the fake election results
[2:14:39.620 --> 2:14:42.980]  With the with the fake voters and the illegal voters and hillary clinton getting
[2:14:43.380 --> 2:14:46.900]  Three million in the popular vote just because of california and new york alone
[2:14:48.020 --> 2:14:49.700]  That's all a lie
[2:14:49.700 --> 2:14:51.700]  america hates hillary clinton
[2:14:52.340 --> 2:14:58.980]  I think america hates hillary clinton and that's why everybody is actually looking into this stuff except the people on cn
[2:14:58.980 --> 2:15:03.380]  That's my favorite wiki leaks thing was one of the emails where like the staff guy that's with hillary
[2:15:03.380 --> 2:15:08.260]  They go to like a fast food chain place and and they're all filming her and everyone's like
[2:15:08.900 --> 2:15:12.260]  Why are you guys filming this old lady? No one likes her. No one knows who she was
[2:15:12.820 --> 2:15:17.460]  And she just sits down quietly and like there no one's coming over and asking for pictures or autographs or anything
[2:15:17.620 --> 2:15:22.660]  It's just like who is this random old lady with a giant entourage of people. It's literally all fake. It's all fake
[2:15:22.820 --> 2:15:25.780]  The guy's email. He's like it was the most awkward situation i've ever been in like
[2:15:26.180 --> 2:15:29.860]  You know hillary clinton here. She comes into this place and no one even notices her it was think about it
[2:15:29.860 --> 2:15:35.860]  Think about how fake this woman is they tell you she's healthy. She literally can't go through a 30 minute speech without hacking up along
[2:15:36.660 --> 2:15:40.900]  They have to cordon off rooms and to make the cameras angles look like she has a big audience
[2:15:41.060 --> 2:15:43.060]  She couldn't get a big audience for one of her rallies
[2:15:43.620 --> 2:15:48.740]  Uh, I mean that was the funniest thing is when I was in long beach california covering all the different races out there
[2:15:49.140 --> 2:15:52.660]  There was this giant sports coliseum an outdoor football arena
[2:15:52.900 --> 2:15:56.420]  They could have had you know like 30 40 000 it was a you know a smaller one
[2:15:56.420 --> 2:16:02.180]  But she could have filled that up apparently from what the mainstream media says because she's got a 90 chance of winning
[2:16:02.580 --> 2:16:06.260]  Instead fake across the street. There's this tiny little elementary
[2:16:06.820 --> 2:16:09.540]  recess area that she could barely even feel
[2:16:10.180 --> 2:16:16.420]  So again her support fake the polls fake their votes for her fake. This is entirely fake
[2:16:16.580 --> 2:16:20.660]  It's all it's all literally a facade. It's unbelievable. The matrix is real
[2:16:20.820 --> 2:16:25.300]  Well, this intimidation shut people down because it's going to hurt the feelings of the family if the family
[2:16:25.300 --> 2:16:32.180]  I can't believe that a family would not want to know unless somebody like brad bowman is telling them to say that exactly
[2:16:32.340 --> 2:16:35.940]  Exactly, and you know, uh, I with with with them hiring brad bowman
[2:16:36.180 --> 2:16:39.540]  I think it gives us permission to go to the truth. Yeah
[2:16:39.700 --> 2:16:43.620]  Uh in in spite of the family's feelings and and I think we have to do this, you know, uh
[2:16:44.180 --> 2:16:51.460]  Something that was missed in the media was a few weeks ago when when the uh, uh, Seth rich story his connection to weekly licks came out
[2:16:51.460 --> 2:16:56.100]  Uh, uh, that was also the day that they went uh full bore
[2:16:56.740 --> 2:17:00.500]  On the comey story and they it was the wag the dog week
[2:17:01.380 --> 2:17:08.980]  We didn't see any anybody that might have uh, uh, bothered to cover the Seth rich, which not many mainstream medias are willing to do
[2:17:09.540 --> 2:17:10.980]  Uh, uh
[2:17:10.980 --> 2:17:15.940]  Had it had an option to go with the comey story, which was all nonsense about the the russian collusion
[2:17:16.260 --> 2:17:19.300]  So we saw a real wag the dog moment and
[2:17:19.300 --> 2:17:21.300]  Uh, uh
[2:17:21.460 --> 2:17:26.420]  That week was I think an important week. I started to call you guys because we needed to talk about it
[2:17:26.420 --> 2:17:29.460]  You know, what's funny about that on a separate issue, but the similar story
[2:17:29.860 --> 2:17:34.420]  Jay johnson today in his testimony said that they kept asking about well
[2:17:34.420 --> 2:17:38.180]  When did you open the rusher thing and he said well actually we opened the rusher thing?
[2:17:38.180 --> 2:17:42.340]  I think he said october 6th or it was something october 7th, maybe
[2:17:43.220 --> 2:17:46.180]  The same day the billy bush tape were released
[2:17:46.180 --> 2:17:50.820]  This is it's a wag the dog. This is a tactic. Yeah, it's the same deal
[2:17:51.460 --> 2:17:53.460]  So the biggest story of the week
[2:17:53.460 --> 2:17:58.740]  Perhaps the biggest story of the year was that means motive and opportunity the dnc
[2:17:59.460 --> 2:18:06.740]  Very likely killed one of the run uh to punish him and we looked at the pedestal email where they said you punish this guy
[2:18:06.900 --> 2:18:10.180]  You know, whoever the leak is right? Yep, then he shows up dead a week later
[2:18:10.180 --> 2:18:17.140]  So the biggest story of the year gets buried by this nonsense comey and in russia collusion and and now
[2:18:17.460 --> 2:18:23.540]  Uh, if you mention it, you're you know, you're you're ridiculed and uh, we should be talking about look at this
[2:18:23.540 --> 2:18:25.620]  That's what i'm saying the biggest story of the year
[2:18:25.620 --> 2:18:31.540]  They have never denied that the content of the wiki leaks is legitimate. You notice how they've never denied that
[2:18:31.780 --> 2:18:36.260]  Why don't we have an investigation in an email that talks about having kids at a pool for entertainment?
[2:18:36.260 --> 2:18:41.300]  I'm sorry. Has there been a hearing on that? Haven't seen a hearing on that. What about a hearing on john podesta saying?
[2:18:41.300 --> 2:18:44.820]  He'll make an example of the leaker. What about the wetworks in these
[2:18:45.540 --> 2:18:51.460]  Emails that again, they admit are real the emails are real though that content is real just nothing look at them
[2:18:51.940 --> 2:18:58.500]  They always use of russians to misdirect away from their own crimes and that's what they're doing today in the jay johnson hearings
[2:18:58.900 --> 2:19:03.300]  They're misdirecting the public's attention away from the fact that jay johnson and homeland security
[2:19:03.300 --> 2:19:07.060]  Hacked into these state boards of elections. They wanted to get into the voter rolls
[2:19:07.140 --> 2:19:11.300]  They wanted to create a situation where they could take it over calling it critical infrastructure
[2:19:11.620 --> 2:19:12.740]  And so what do they do they say?
[2:19:12.740 --> 2:19:17.940]  Well, it's the russians and they did this all after the fact after everything had escalated for months
[2:19:18.260 --> 2:19:21.060]  After congressmen had written them for an explanation
[2:19:21.460 --> 2:19:23.060]  They wanted a special
[2:19:23.060 --> 2:19:27.220]  Independent prosecutor to look into this because they didn't believe homeland security was going to investigate themselves
[2:19:27.460 --> 2:19:30.740]  I don't either and so after all of this happens now
[2:19:30.740 --> 2:19:34.180]  They're bringing this stuff up saying well, we just now discovered that my favorite thing
[2:19:34.420 --> 2:19:39.220]  My favorite revelation the entire comey hearings was when marco rubio goes all these leaks are coming out
[2:19:39.380 --> 2:19:42.180]  But not one time was it ever leaked that president
[2:19:43.060 --> 2:19:44.820]  Trump was not
[2:19:44.820 --> 2:19:49.700]  Being investigated because I found that very odd everybody in the senate knew everything and then he even comes out later
[2:19:49.780 --> 2:19:52.740]  I'm goes. Oh, I'm I'm the one to leak the memos to my buddy right
[2:19:52.900 --> 2:19:56.260]  And I'm kind of a coward and I'm kind of really not good at what I do
[2:19:56.260 --> 2:20:01.380]  He's a cowardly leaker by his own admission. I posted the picture of the cowardly line from the wizard of awe
[2:20:03.140 --> 2:20:05.140]  Cowardly comey. He's leaking too
[2:20:05.860 --> 2:20:09.860]  Well, gary, you're about to uh, you're about to lead the set any final words from gary haven
[2:20:10.180 --> 2:20:13.300]  Yeah, you know, I want to say thank god for alex jones and you guys
[2:20:14.020 --> 2:20:17.140]  And thank god that the president of the united states is getting some of his
[2:20:17.700 --> 2:20:22.980]  Information from you. Well, thank god the president of the united states isn't hillary clinton, but at least trump is a true american
[2:20:22.980 --> 2:20:28.020]  Well, you know, he's struggling. Uh, but I think he is a pursuer of truth
[2:20:28.340 --> 2:20:34.340]  He just got a heck of a job to do. He is surrounded by the enemy. Yeah, you don't want this thing the deep state
[2:20:34.500 --> 2:20:38.420]  Okay, uh, we've all been talking about the deep state for a long time
[2:20:39.220 --> 2:20:43.780]  I don't know if you guys have noticed it or not, uh, but in the last uh, probably four or five months
[2:20:44.420 --> 2:20:48.740]  They have taken the term deep state and then he's modified it
[2:20:48.740 --> 2:20:55.620]  The deep state now means according to them those leftovers from the obama administration
[2:20:56.100 --> 2:20:57.940]  That are there and implanted
[2:20:57.940 --> 2:21:02.980]  In and they write names of the meaning from those people who are really in power
[2:21:03.140 --> 2:21:08.500]  Yes, and see that's that's the exact type of thing just by trump existing
[2:21:08.820 --> 2:21:13.860]  That's the kind of stuff that's just been exposed the swamp has exposed itself the fake news has exposed itself
[2:21:14.100 --> 2:21:17.140]  That's the trump effect gary haven't thank you so much for your time

[2:25:33.220 --> 2:25:37.700]  Do you guys ever wake up and feel like you're the last sane person on earth?
[2:25:37.700 --> 2:25:42.900]  That's how I feel every time when I'm watching these russian hearings this russia investigation
[2:25:43.060 --> 2:25:47.220]  I'm sitting here scratch mats like nothing burger. There's nothing there. This is unbelievable. We're wasting all this time and money
[2:25:47.460 --> 2:25:53.540]  Meanwhile, you've got these huge, you know, there needs to be an investigation to set the rich huge hearings on the wiki leaks all that
[2:25:53.540 --> 2:25:54.900]  We don't get any of that
[2:25:54.900 --> 2:26:01.380]  Just like how how is this the reality? I really can't even believe it. Yeah, there's plenty of things that should be investigated that are being
[2:26:01.380 --> 2:26:07.780]  The patent foundation. I mean watch it. Have we spent time and time and time again on something that's clearly been disproved
[2:26:08.180 --> 2:26:11.700]  Over and over and over again, and that's what gobel says
[2:26:12.180 --> 2:26:17.300]  A lie told wants to lie a lie told repeatedly over and over again becomes a truth and that's what they're doing
[2:26:17.540 --> 2:26:23.700]  That's why that's that's their whole narrative. Well, that's what Jerome Corsi was talking about how to shut down that propaganda narrative
[2:26:23.700 --> 2:26:25.700]  It's a very specific technique
[2:26:26.580 --> 2:26:29.380]  and a lot of times you just you're not going to be able to
[2:26:29.380 --> 2:26:31.380]  Disprove
[2:26:31.460 --> 2:26:38.100]  Uh, something that never existed. Okay, that's what they want you to try to do and so we're there to analyze what they're saying
[2:26:38.180 --> 2:26:40.180]  We're there to expose what they're saying
[2:26:40.260 --> 2:26:44.900]  But we also understand we're not the only ones who are awake. We've got a lot of people out there
[2:26:44.900 --> 2:26:48.020]  We know that from social media. That's the key thing about the internet and social media
[2:26:48.340 --> 2:26:55.460]  Is that this allowed us to connect with other people who know what's going on? They know that this is a lie and to
[2:26:56.260 --> 2:26:57.380]  transcend
[2:26:57.380 --> 2:27:00.660]  This captive narrative that people like Tom Brokow
[2:27:01.300 --> 2:27:06.020]  Made a career out of lying to the public feeding them government press releases
[2:27:06.340 --> 2:27:09.380]  Telling them that's the truth if you disagree with the
[2:27:09.940 --> 2:27:14.100]  Government's official story about the JFK assassination that's a conspiracy theory
[2:27:14.100 --> 2:27:20.180]  That's when they started using that term and so that's the way they shut down anything if you question any of the details of any of their
[2:27:20.660 --> 2:27:26.660]  Official narratives no matter how ridiculous they are then they're going to call you a conspiracy theorist
[2:27:26.660 --> 2:27:30.740]  It's a very weaponized method, but people are getting around that
[2:27:30.740 --> 2:27:33.700]  that's why they're trying to use the next level is to go through and
[2:27:34.420 --> 2:27:38.500]  Try to shut down social media try to take over control the internet because that's
[2:27:39.140 --> 2:27:41.540]  What is allowed people to transcend this narrative?
[2:27:41.940 --> 2:27:48.660]  They don't control the information anymore. Tom Brokow is a dinosaur fossil from the past and he doesn't even realize it
[2:27:48.980 --> 2:27:54.180]  And and because he's trying to hand the baton to Kelly and or Megan Kelly and she doesn't well
[2:27:54.180 --> 2:27:59.460]  And they're already self-censoring social media or soft censoring social media soft censoring google results
[2:27:59.460 --> 2:28:00.500]  They don't do the hard thing yet
[2:28:00.500 --> 2:28:05.700]  They kind of are just kind of just rolling it out softly introducing it so that the people don't freak out like oh
[2:28:05.700 --> 2:28:08.420]  You're filtering my search results even though that's exactly
[2:28:08.980 --> 2:28:09.620]  What they're doing
[2:28:09.620 --> 2:28:14.340]  I remember being a private in the army when I first joined and I remember getting into a debate with one of my drill
[2:28:14.740 --> 2:28:18.500]  Real drill sergeants about the news and how he was kind of a woke guy
[2:28:18.500 --> 2:28:20.180]  He was kind of he kind of it was going on
[2:28:20.180 --> 2:28:24.740]  But I was kind of stubborn in my ways still and I was like no I was like fox news fair and balanced
[2:28:24.740 --> 2:28:26.900]  I was like that's real news. They're not going to lie to us
[2:28:27.460 --> 2:28:30.820]  And and and then I deploy fast for a little bit and I see that
[2:28:31.460 --> 2:28:36.660]  The movie about 9 11 loose change and all that my whole mind changes. I get red pill in this one film and
[2:28:37.380 --> 2:28:41.140]  One of the first big reports every day the info wars with jacari in Ferguson
[2:28:41.460 --> 2:28:44.660]  And I remember sitting there because I had this whole area roped off
[2:28:44.660 --> 2:28:50.500]  The media staging area the media staging area and they these guys were just like so happy to be in this area
[2:28:50.740 --> 2:28:54.020]  And all I wanted to do was get out of that area and actually go see what was going on
[2:28:54.020 --> 2:28:58.020]  And they were and they were they were telling us that they would arrest us if we left that area
[2:28:58.260 --> 2:29:02.820]  I would see the police come at the end of the night and go. Okay. This is what happened. Yeah, and they would go
[2:29:02.900 --> 2:29:07.300]  Well, apparently we were live right now from Ferguson, Missouri. This is what we saw. No, you didn't see it
[2:29:07.780 --> 2:29:10.020]  You know what this is we saw this press release
[2:29:10.020 --> 2:29:14.420]  This is actually an interesting an interesting talking point an interesting discussion to have
[2:29:14.900 --> 2:29:20.020]  You know because I was in Ferguson with you and and there's been an amazing kind of changing of
[2:29:20.820 --> 2:29:26.260]  Of everything that's happened since Ferguson because I was of the same belief as you when I was in Ferguson
[2:29:26.260 --> 2:29:28.260]  I saw the police lying about what they were doing
[2:29:28.500 --> 2:29:31.780]  The police tactics that they used in Ferguson were awful and again
[2:29:32.020 --> 2:29:35.780]  This is this is this has nothing to do with that what actually happened or didn't happen to mike brown
[2:29:36.020 --> 2:29:38.020]  This is just in the aftermath
[2:29:38.020 --> 2:29:42.980]  The one thing that they did remember this was the second night. They said we're not using gas
[2:29:43.060 --> 2:29:48.340]  We're not using gas canisters and then they're literally firing the gas canisters into the crowd
[2:29:48.740 --> 2:29:53.300]  I was sitting there filming so I got shot and I'm like this looks like gas. What is going on?
[2:29:53.460 --> 2:29:57.380]  You're clearly firing gas. I was live the police officer standing right next to me. No not gas
[2:29:57.460 --> 2:30:00.420]  We're not using gas tonight. Nope. Not gas about 30 minutes later
[2:30:00.420 --> 2:30:08.420]  Joe Biggs and jacari jackson come sprinting back into the media literally crying coughing hacking their lungs out vomiting and they're like
[2:30:08.500 --> 2:30:11.460]  We just got gassed. We just got gassed. They're using the gas out there
[2:30:11.700 --> 2:30:16.500]  And I immediately turned to the to police officer. I'm like you said they weren't using gas or and he's like we're not using gas
[2:30:16.820 --> 2:30:20.420]  And and you're literally like coiled over dying my your conspiracy theories
[2:30:20.420 --> 2:30:25.780]  Oh, my eyes were blood red because at this point in time me and jacari had been chased out by an m-wrap about a mile
[2:30:26.180 --> 2:30:27.460]  outside of Ferguson
[2:30:27.460 --> 2:30:31.540]  When you saw us we had just run back in I was angry. I was oh, yeah
[2:30:31.780 --> 2:30:36.980]  Oh, my gosh, dude called me and he goes, uh, right now on the news. You're saying that no gases use that trills
[2:30:36.980 --> 2:30:39.780]  Like that's complete total crap. No, no, you came back
[2:30:41.140 --> 2:30:45.620]  You came to find the camera and the reporter didn't you cbs? Yeah, I was like, where are they at?
[2:30:45.780 --> 2:30:48.740]  Where are they at? And I run over there and I see him. I was like you guys are lying
[2:30:49.220 --> 2:30:51.220]  Yeah, I just see him going
[2:30:51.220 --> 2:30:57.220]  Oh, but the amazing thing is but but but it's weird because there's been kind of a changing of the approach or a weird
[2:30:57.460 --> 2:31:01.860]  Basically because of antifa now because of the trump protests and how violent they've gotten
[2:31:02.340 --> 2:31:07.300]  The police have actually kind of had to change their stance or we've had to change our stance on the police because it's like
[2:31:07.380 --> 2:31:10.500]  Hey, somebody has to do something about antifa. These people are out of control
[2:31:10.740 --> 2:31:13.700]  We're on the march the empires on the run
[2:31:13.700 --> 2:31:21.060]  Alex Jones and the gcn radio network
[2:31:22.500 --> 2:31:30.180]  Anarchists and antifa activists continue to engage in sporadic street battles across the country
[2:31:30.260 --> 2:31:37.780]  And they are targeting trump supporters and that means extremism experts are now focusing on the left
[2:31:37.780 --> 2:31:45.940]  Retired lieutenant colonel anthony Schaefer recently appeared on fox and friends and gave the mainstream media a dose of the truth
[2:31:46.020 --> 2:31:52.180]  The progressive left has been radicalized and they want a civil war and the pathology is clear
[2:31:52.580 --> 2:31:57.620]  If one side begins to act violently you have inevitably the other side starting to come back
[2:31:57.780 --> 2:31:58.660]  It always happens
[2:31:58.660 --> 2:32:02.660]  So we we have to understand if the government does not stop the violence on the left
[2:32:02.660 --> 2:32:10.020]  You'll see more violence on the right retaliation. It's inevitable. Meanwhile info wars continues to expose how the global elite
[2:32:10.260 --> 2:32:18.100]  Are orchestrating a destabilization program to take down America and you are the resistance

[2:33:02.020 --> 2:33:05.780]  The elixir pure breeze would be a steal at 300 400 500 dollars

[2:33:27.460 --> 2:33:34.740]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense
[2:33:35.300 --> 2:33:40.660]  60 years ago when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs
[2:33:40.740 --> 2:33:48.020]  They had drums of their own air raid sirens, but in the 21st century there are silent weapons for quiet war
[2:33:48.020 --> 2:33:53.780]  Pathogens added to the food and water and to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality

[2:36:44.900 --> 2:36:50.900]  Before we get into syria and world war three. I just wanted to bring this story up because
[2:36:51.860 --> 2:36:53.860]  This is an undeniable story
[2:36:54.340 --> 2:36:56.340]  When you have debates about the border
[2:36:56.340 --> 2:37:00.260]  These are the topics that need to be discussed not your virtue
[2:37:00.660 --> 2:37:06.260]  Okay, not the fact that you love everybody or that everybody needs to coexist or that everyone's a racist
[2:37:06.660 --> 2:37:08.660]  No, those aren't the issues. These are the issues
[2:37:09.460 --> 2:37:13.940]  Half of organs detained illegals guilty of sex crimes
[2:37:14.820 --> 2:37:16.820]  47.5
[2:37:16.820 --> 2:37:24.260]  percent of all illegal aliens currently in custody and organ are guilty of sex crimes these range from rape
[2:37:24.260 --> 2:37:26.260]  To sodomy
[2:37:26.660 --> 2:37:30.900]  To sexual abuse half of the ones detained in organ are guilty
[2:37:31.700 --> 2:37:36.660]  Boy, I wonder do you think that translate to the entire country? Of course it does
[2:37:36.980 --> 2:37:43.140]  That's why we want a strong border. That's why open border policies have failed. That's why europe is collapsing right now
[2:37:43.300 --> 2:37:46.020]  That's why sweden is now the rape capital of the world
[2:37:46.020 --> 2:37:53.780]  You know those are not on the list of crimes that our sheriff here and uh travis county said she would report these people to
[2:37:54.340 --> 2:38:00.980]  Immigration control right. They can't even get rape kits in travis county, right? Well, she had she had like three specific crimes
[2:38:01.300 --> 2:38:06.980]  And that wasn't on it and they had somebody turn up and she's oh, well, yeah, maybe we should add
[2:38:07.540 --> 2:38:13.380]  Sexual abuse crimes and stuff like that to that maybe if we catch an illegal doing that maybe then i'll turn them over to ice or whatever
[2:38:13.380 --> 2:38:20.020]  So maybe yeah, maybe so she added that that was one of the things that got the texas legislature and governor abbot
[2:38:20.500 --> 2:38:24.740]  To run this thing through about um saying look if you're not going to enforce the law
[2:38:24.740 --> 2:38:30.820]  We're going to come after you and uh, so that's uh, that's something to keep in mind and when we look at the
[2:38:31.060 --> 2:38:36.260]  The criminal issues here. We need to understand too as we're seeing in place where my wife grew up in long island
[2:38:36.500 --> 2:38:42.100]  It is now overrun with ms-13 in just one county. They have over 400 ms-13
[2:38:42.100 --> 2:38:50.020]  Members. How did that begin? It began in the 1980s with a bunch of illegal immigrants from el salvador
[2:38:50.420 --> 2:38:55.220]  Demanding that they get amnesty and at the time the secretary of state george schultz said we're not going to
[2:38:55.700 --> 2:38:59.380]  Conceive to their demands. It's going to create a lot of problems, but they created a massive
[2:39:00.020 --> 2:39:05.780]  Criminal enterprise that is unbelievably cruel. Nobody can believe what they they hack people
[2:39:06.260 --> 2:39:10.020]  In ways to just intimidate people they they go excessively over the top
[2:39:10.020 --> 2:39:14.580]  To intimidate people and the people that they're doing this to are by and large
[2:39:15.860 --> 2:39:21.860]  People who are also illegal immigrants who come to this country and they're being pressured to get into that gang
[2:39:22.420 --> 2:39:27.060]  And so they are if they refuse to get into that gang or they don't want to be a part of it
[2:39:27.380 --> 2:39:30.980]  Then they become exhibit a as to why you do what ms-13
[2:39:31.700 --> 2:39:36.260]  Wants you to do so it's the people who are trying to escape that violence coming across
[2:39:36.260 --> 2:39:40.580]  But if you have no control over the borders, they can't stop the criminals
[2:39:40.900 --> 2:39:45.700]  Daming them over in this country. Don't you understand? It's your hate that's causing them to be gangsters
[2:39:45.940 --> 2:39:48.580]  It's your hate that's causing them to join ms-13
[2:39:49.380 --> 2:39:52.900]  The reason that these gangs are violent and that isis kills people and be heads everyone
[2:39:52.980 --> 2:39:59.060]  Well, hey, so the next time the science guy said the next time a liberal wants to tell you how much they care about the non-citizens
[2:39:59.140 --> 2:40:01.140]  Quit being racist. Where's your heart?
[2:40:01.220 --> 2:40:04.100]  Tell them oh really half of them are guilty of sex crimes
[2:40:04.100 --> 2:40:09.700]  And the other half are probably joining gangs like ms-13. Hmm. You want to invite them into your home?
[2:40:10.260 --> 2:40:13.860]  I doubt it and that's why none of them have yet and none of them ever will
[2:40:14.340 --> 2:40:18.020]  Despite the multiple calls. Yeah, that's people that like do you have a door on your home?
[2:40:18.020 --> 2:40:20.260]  I'm kind of curious. Well, yeah, I don't want random people to come in
[2:40:20.260 --> 2:40:25.780]  I'm like, yeah, that kind of seems like a great idea right? What about window? No, man? No, no borders coexist
[2:40:25.860 --> 2:40:28.820]  I don't want something that could come in that could hurt me. I go, okay, so
[2:40:29.460 --> 2:40:33.300]  You want a wall then right? We don't want random people coming in. We want to have a better vetting process
[2:40:33.300 --> 2:40:37.940]  Yeah, you're a racist. No, the pope doesn't have a wall. Obama doesn't have a wall on his new mansion
[2:40:38.020 --> 2:40:41.380]  I'll do a like a video where we have Michael Moore and knock on people's door like hey
[2:40:41.380 --> 2:40:46.820]  We're gonna be removing your door because we're gonna start letting everyone in so just we just want an open border here at your house
[2:40:46.820 --> 2:40:51.300]  Yes, we're gonna have a whole bunch of random and half of the people are gonna be guilty of sex crimes too
[2:40:51.620 --> 2:40:53.860]  So you're okay with that right and you have a little girl, right?
[2:40:54.340 --> 2:40:58.660]  Okay, so you can coexist them in there with with them. Perfect. Perfect. It'll be nice and loving
[2:40:58.660 --> 2:41:00.900]  Oh, and by the way, I like your really big mansion next week
[2:41:00.900 --> 2:41:06.660]  I'm gonna bring about 30 or 40 people over for a party. Um, we're gonna need to use that. Yeah, you're racist. If you don't let us
[2:41:06.740 --> 2:41:11.140]  Yeah, absolutely. Don't be a bigot. Open your doors for anybody and everybody. That's I mean come on now
[2:41:11.140 --> 2:41:14.420]  You're bleeding heart liberal even though half of them are guilty of sex crimes. What's going on?
[2:41:14.420 --> 2:41:19.940]  So but that's just an interesting story again. That's a study. This is undeniable. These are just stats
[2:41:20.420 --> 2:41:25.140]  But the liberals were then will deny all the stats all the truth all day long if it goes against their
[2:41:25.140 --> 2:41:32.820]  Virtuous bleeding heart just just everything's good. Everything has to be the best. They'll just say 90% loving trendy
[2:41:33.620 --> 2:41:37.940]  All right, let's move on to some geopolitical news developing worldwide
[2:41:38.420 --> 2:41:41.460]  Uh, I mean you could possibly say
[2:41:42.340 --> 2:41:47.700]  With the united states downing of the syrian aircraft and then russia's response to it
[2:41:48.020 --> 2:41:54.740]  We are probably at the most tense point right now with syria and russia in the united states right now in the building
[2:41:54.740 --> 2:41:57.780]  To a conflict in syria that could lead to a bigger conflict
[2:41:57.780 --> 2:42:00.660]  I'm not sure if we've really ever had a
[2:42:01.300 --> 2:42:06.980]  More tense situation than we do right now. I think people need to understand was really at risk here
[2:42:06.980 --> 2:42:11.140]  Americans don't take this as seriously as they should. You know the same day that this jet was
[2:42:11.940 --> 2:42:14.340]  Shot down had this story on daily mail
[2:42:14.340 --> 2:42:19.940]  And it was just a retrospect going back about the secret underground bunkers that we've all read about before
[2:42:19.940 --> 2:42:24.660]  That the government created for themselves to make sure that they could survive a nuclear attack
[2:42:24.820 --> 2:42:28.020]  They didn't do anything for us that we bombed by the way
[2:42:28.180 --> 2:42:28.500]  That's right
[2:42:28.500 --> 2:42:31.860]  Well, they they didn't do anything for us is that hiding in secret underground bunkers
[2:42:32.260 --> 2:42:37.380]  Eating wild birds pets and saving their secretaries, but not their wives how the government plan
[2:42:37.940 --> 2:42:40.660]  To survive a nuclear attack the government elites
[2:42:40.660 --> 2:42:46.660]  So they pointed out how presidents kennedy eisenhower rosevelt truman all knew that there was only going to be enough room for
[2:42:46.660 --> 2:42:51.940]  Elite few but they still reassured and lied to the american public and said that's all right
[2:42:52.340 --> 2:42:57.060]  You'll be safe in the event of a nuclear war. I mean the way we're telling us crazy things like hey
[2:42:57.060 --> 2:43:00.900]  If there's a nuclear attack get out of your car and get into a ditch
[2:43:01.780 --> 2:43:03.220]  Next to the car
[2:43:03.220 --> 2:43:07.860]  Things like that. I remember when they had the cuban missile crisis and I was a child and and like first grade and
[2:43:08.260 --> 2:43:11.060]  They were saying well, you know when this this happens
[2:43:11.300 --> 2:43:15.380]  You need to make sure that you duck and cover put your head inside the metal desk
[2:43:15.380 --> 2:43:19.940]  And even as you know a six-year-old child is like seriously
[2:43:20.740 --> 2:43:25.220]  Is this so you can identify my body afterwards is like who believes this stuff?
[2:43:25.220 --> 2:43:29.220]  And yet these are the kinds of lies that they were telling us so you have to understand
[2:43:29.780 --> 2:43:31.780]  That these people who are pushing for war
[2:43:32.580 --> 2:43:36.980]  Care nothing at all about you they these hideouts that they've got were made to protect them
[2:43:37.460 --> 2:43:42.660]  Not the american public and as a guy who wrote a book on it said he said the government would protect itself
[2:43:42.660 --> 2:43:46.100]  And let the rest of us die. That's national security experts
[2:43:46.100 --> 2:43:49.940]  So what we're seeing here with this as they're escalating this last thursday. We had
[2:43:50.420 --> 2:43:52.820]  us artillery positioned in a
[2:43:53.620 --> 2:43:54.980]  move forward in a
[2:43:54.980 --> 2:44:00.340]  Syria to target syrian forces and that was thursday then
[2:44:00.980 --> 2:44:04.020]  I think it was monday that the jet was shot down
[2:44:04.900 --> 2:44:09.860]  And now we've had another close call today. We've had nato jets
[2:44:09.860 --> 2:44:17.620]  Uh being uh buzzing a defense minister's plane in syrian two syrian drones were down by the united states too
[2:44:17.700 --> 2:44:24.100]  That's right. So the question is they're not there to fight isis. They're still there doing regime change
[2:44:24.420 --> 2:44:27.860]  And there's this article from anti-war they talk about how the white house
[2:44:28.260 --> 2:44:32.580]  Wants to widen the syrian war despite the pentagon's objection by white house
[2:44:32.900 --> 2:44:36.180]  What they mean is the national security council that would be people like
[2:44:36.180 --> 2:44:40.740]  mcmaster who is just at the bill de berg conference and they talk about the fact that
[2:44:41.140 --> 2:44:45.380]  They those people at the national security council and again mcmaster's isn't of
[2:44:46.340 --> 2:44:52.580]  An accomplice of patreus and so forth. They're the ones who don't see this as a fight against isis
[2:44:52.900 --> 2:44:55.540]  They see it as a fight against Assad
[2:44:56.020 --> 2:45:02.260]  That is a prescription for a broader war and they point out that on the other hand you've got mattis
[2:45:02.260 --> 2:45:06.660]  Who is at the pentagon saying no, we want to fight isis. Well, you know if we want to fight isis
[2:45:06.660 --> 2:45:13.220]  Maybe the best thing we could do is get out of the civil war instead of interjecting ourselves into it and let the russians
[2:45:13.620 --> 2:45:15.620]  And the syrians who are winning
[2:45:15.860 --> 2:45:20.180]  Continue to fight isis and yet we continue to align ourselves with these ever changing groups
[2:45:20.660 --> 2:45:25.700]  Always changing their names always changing their demographics or anything and always telling us that they're not isis
[2:45:25.780 --> 2:45:28.180]  But they are isis and I think the proof
[2:45:28.180 --> 2:45:31.620]  Of what you're saying is in the pudding where?
[2:45:32.340 --> 2:45:35.700]  The jet that takes down the syrian fighter
[2:45:35.940 --> 2:45:41.220]  They say oh well the syrian fighter was bombing our our back forces in raka
[2:45:41.700 --> 2:45:46.820]  And so then syria says no russia says no we were bombing isis. They're both the same
[2:45:46.980 --> 2:45:51.060]  That's right. They're both the same and that's what they don't want to tell you. That's what they won't admit
[2:45:51.220 --> 2:45:53.220]  They're both telling the truth. Okay, exactly
[2:45:53.300 --> 2:45:57.780]  They're just putting a different spin on it and the reason why they're spinning it is because exactly what you said
[2:45:57.780 --> 2:46:03.140]  Because the real goal in syria is to remove Assad from power which then brings it back home
[2:46:03.140 --> 2:46:06.100]  And you say we've got all these investigations going on
[2:46:06.580 --> 2:46:15.780]  Completely phony saying that russia is trying to influence regime change in america. Meanwhile, we are literally trying to force a regime change in syria
[2:46:15.860 --> 2:46:18.900]  This is why I wake up and ask myself if i'm the last sane man on earth
[2:46:19.140 --> 2:46:20.740]  How can we actually cover this well?
[2:46:20.740 --> 2:46:22.420]  Then you have the air force too
[2:46:22.420 --> 2:46:28.500]  You're dropping off munitions and weapons us arsenals and then isis brags about it. Yeah to isis and the thing is though
[2:46:28.500 --> 2:46:31.860]  Is i'm not blaming these you know these air force pilots because they're given a
[2:46:32.420 --> 2:46:37.140]  You know a coordinate and they go and they fly and they drop it and they even said we don't want to be isis's air force
[2:46:37.140 --> 2:46:39.140]  So but here's the thing those and then they are
[2:46:39.460 --> 2:46:42.340]  Yeah, and they all they do is they fly and they drop it. They don't know where it's going
[2:46:42.340 --> 2:46:46.500]  They're told hey, this is for rebel forces to take out of isis blah blah blah it goes there next thing
[2:46:46.500 --> 2:46:51.140]  You know, so let me ask you this then so let me ask you this because you would have a little insight onto this so
[2:46:51.140 --> 2:46:52.020]  So
[2:46:52.020 --> 2:46:57.060]  john mccain apparently is the only one meeting with these forces on the ground john mccain did it in 2012
[2:46:57.060 --> 2:47:01.300]  He did it again this year. He does it, you know secretly the media doesn't talk about it. He's yeah
[2:47:01.300 --> 2:47:04.820]  Well, he's the one that brags too. He's like i'm on the ground talking to these people
[2:47:04.900 --> 2:47:08.820]  I'm on the ground. I know what's going on anytime anyone wants to say anything about it
[2:47:09.300 --> 2:47:14.420]  So and he's got sorrows donating to his right and then you've got sorrows giving him money too, so
[2:47:14.420 --> 2:47:21.620]  Well, I mean, what do you think the odds are joe that john mccain essentially somehow is influencing these
[2:47:22.180 --> 2:47:24.180]  Isis fighters in syria
[2:47:24.340 --> 2:47:31.140]  But has somehow tricked people in the states to think that there's some sort of moderate rebels or something
[2:47:31.620 --> 2:47:34.260]  That are trying to help them with their regime change
[2:47:34.900 --> 2:47:35.620]  How much?
[2:47:35.620 --> 2:47:42.900]  Decompartmentalization or compartmentalization is there with john mccain in the meetings that he's having with i what i believe are isis fighters in syria
[2:47:42.900 --> 2:47:44.900]  I just don't get out people don't see it
[2:47:45.780 --> 2:47:50.100]  It's plain as day. I mean this guy yeah just months after just months after he goes there
[2:47:50.100 --> 2:47:52.100]  They have chemical attacks that happen twice, you know
[2:47:52.740 --> 2:47:57.220]  And it's funny. He's like one of the only republicans that the democrats ever kind of go don't talk about him bad
[2:47:57.220 --> 2:48:04.020]  He's a hero like to me. I always find that interesting. They attack every republican except or I mean they you know they attack everybody but for him
[2:48:04.980 --> 2:48:05.620]  He's awesome
[2:48:05.620 --> 2:48:10.420]  Why because he's a means to an end because the democrats wanted to overthrow Assad the entire time under obama
[2:48:10.420 --> 2:48:16.260]  They completely tried to use the military to overthrow Assad and the first time obama did it, you know, americans were like no
[2:48:16.260 --> 2:48:21.220]  This is ridiculous. Why would we do that? We need to understand and we need to as supporters of trump
[2:48:21.300 --> 2:48:23.540]  We need to contact him and we need to tell him
[2:48:24.180 --> 2:48:29.220]  That we don't want to get involved in regime change in syria. He made that very clear
[2:48:29.300 --> 2:48:34.180]  He ran on that issue and culture said at this point time when when they shot the missiles off
[2:48:34.180 --> 2:48:40.420]  Uh, because there was the the news story that uh, they these children had been gassed by the syrian government
[2:48:40.420 --> 2:48:43.540]  And we've seen that whole playbook before she said I didn't think at this point in time
[2:48:44.020 --> 2:48:49.940]  We would be fighting over syria that we'd be fighting over whether or not we're going to get rid of the dreamers or something to that effect
[2:48:50.900 --> 2:48:56.180]  We need to talk to trump and we need to get him to do what he said he was going to do
[2:48:56.180 --> 2:48:58.660]  And we've seen this before where the paris climate agreement
[2:48:58.660 --> 2:49:05.300]  There was a delay in terms of getting out of that for several months. He didn't do that. He got out of tpp right away
[2:49:05.380 --> 2:49:10.500]  But then there was this division within the administration. We had uh, people who were telling him no no
[2:49:10.500 --> 2:49:12.500]  We need to stay in that rex, uh
[2:49:13.220 --> 2:49:15.860]  Tillerson was was saying no we want to stay in it and so forth
[2:49:16.340 --> 2:49:21.700]  Other people were pushing for trump to do what he said he was going to do. We've got people in the pentagon
[2:49:21.780 --> 2:49:26.820]  We've got defense secretary james mattis who is saying we do not want to get involved in a wider war
[2:49:26.820 --> 2:49:28.820]  We don't want to
[2:49:28.980 --> 2:49:32.820]  Get involved in this syrian civil war and yet you've got mcmasters
[2:49:33.140 --> 2:49:37.220]  Who is pushing the cia line and they want a not only are they
[2:49:37.780 --> 2:49:39.300]  Trying to get into the syrian civil war
[2:49:39.300 --> 2:49:44.740]  But the ultimate target is to have that as an excuse to get into iran and with the shakeup that we just
[2:49:45.380 --> 2:49:47.380]  Saw in saudi arabia
[2:49:47.300 --> 2:49:52.660]  That is going to be much more likely because the people that the change that we've just seen in the saudi leadership today
[2:49:52.660 --> 2:49:58.260]  That's going to mean that they're going to go much harder for iran. So that's a very large concern for all of us
[2:49:58.420 --> 2:50:00.420]  It's pushing us to the brink of world war three
[2:50:00.500 --> 2:50:04.020]  Well, you got to think about this a lot of these military officials like mcmaster all these people are saying
[2:50:04.260 --> 2:50:08.100]  You know our favorite thing about president trump is the fact that he gives us free reign to do whatever we want
[2:50:08.740 --> 2:50:12.660]  We'll see he needs to retract a statement my mind because you have a lot of these deep state individuals
[2:50:12.660 --> 2:50:14.820]  You have or just fire them all and replace them
[2:50:14.900 --> 2:50:17.220]  But keep mattis though mattis is the right one matt
[2:50:17.220 --> 2:50:18.580]  He needs to go back and say mattis
[2:50:18.580 --> 2:50:23.460]  You have free reign to do what you need to do because mattis like you said wants to take out isis
[2:50:23.540 --> 2:50:28.820]  That's his main objective is to annihilate those guys because you know how many marines that we've lost how many
[2:50:29.380 --> 2:50:34.580]  You know soldiers and all that from isis. He knows it. He's been there. He's been on the battlefield
[2:50:34.580 --> 2:50:35.860]  He understands what that means
[2:50:35.860 --> 2:50:41.140]  He wants to take those guys out and the best way to do that would be to get out of the way of russia and
[2:50:41.540 --> 2:50:45.780]  Syria they are winning with that we do not want greater chaos everywhere
[2:50:45.780 --> 2:50:48.580]  With that we've gone whether it has been libya
[2:50:48.580 --> 2:50:49.300]  uh
[2:50:49.300 --> 2:50:55.220]  With a regime change there it always makes it worse and that we can coordinate our military can come with those guys
[2:50:55.380 --> 2:50:59.860]  Okay, what what what what have you guys seen what targets do you have what high value targets?
[2:51:00.100 --> 2:51:01.700]  Okay, you're low on ammunition
[2:51:01.700 --> 2:51:04.180]  We can bring in a guy real quick and take that four-year instead
[2:51:04.180 --> 2:51:10.260]  We saw just the opposite and they had a hotline that was going to try to avoid this specific type of conflict
[2:51:10.580 --> 2:51:14.180]  The americans did not use that hotline. They shut shot down the
[2:51:14.180 --> 2:51:19.380]  uh, russian plane and now the russians have shut down the hotline because obviously it's of no use
[2:51:19.780 --> 2:51:24.820]  They're escalating this because they want regime change that is a path to chaos
[2:51:25.300 --> 2:51:31.300]  And that is what the cia wants the cia is involved in regime change. They want that here at home as well
[2:51:31.300 --> 2:51:34.100]  That's why the intelligence community is lying about this russian
[2:51:34.660 --> 2:51:36.660]  narrative and if you think that 17
[2:51:37.220 --> 2:51:44.020]  Intelligence agencies and and why in the world would we have 17 intelligence agencies that that is a big red flag for
[2:51:44.020 --> 2:51:50.260]  Any thinking individual, but they're they were also unanimous in their assessment of the phony intelligence that got us into the iraq war
[2:51:50.340 --> 2:51:52.500]  So forget about the unanimous
[2:51:53.620 --> 2:51:58.020]  Consent on we took out the middle east or a lot of control. We went into afghanistan
[2:51:58.260 --> 2:52:02.100]  Opium production went up 90 something same thing will happen in syria if they do this in syria
[2:52:02.340 --> 2:52:07.220]  And if trump thinks that he can make america great again by getting these people off of his backs
[2:52:07.460 --> 2:52:10.260]  By doing the regime change by doing this fake war with russia
[2:52:10.260 --> 2:52:15.540]  Well, we don't support that. That's not what his constituents want. So that's what we need to let him out
[2:52:15.540 --> 2:52:19.460]  Let's get rid of everyone else. We'll be right back with more of the alex joneshell
[2:52:21.460 --> 2:52:25.700]  It's been said any society is only three missed meals away from chaos
[2:52:25.940 --> 2:52:28.180]  Those times may be near think about it
[2:52:28.420 --> 2:52:32.820]  Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from russia and north korea
[2:52:33.060 --> 2:52:37.780]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns
[2:52:37.780 --> 2:52:43.620]  And our crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages from a single cyber attack
[2:52:43.780 --> 2:52:50.260]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency
[2:52:50.500 --> 2:52:58.580]  That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance. That's where my patriot supply comes in get a four week survival food supply for only

[2:53:53.540 --> 2:53:57.220]  When it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get you want to yourself

[2:55:30.500 --> 2:55:32.260]  Well
[2:55:32.260 --> 2:55:37.300]  I was unaware of this but apparently megan kelly made a real fool of herself
[2:55:37.940 --> 2:55:40.100]  When trying to talk about pepper spray
[2:55:40.100 --> 2:55:44.100]  I don't even believe the stories that the guys are telling me about what she said
[2:55:44.660 --> 2:55:51.140]  Uh, but apparently megan kelly, uh, thought something about pepper spray and then just had no idea what was going on
[2:55:51.140 --> 2:55:55.140]  We remember the occupy wall street demonstrations. I think had a shirt or was funded
[2:55:55.220 --> 2:55:59.620]  Yeah, you remember the set in that was at berkeley and everybody remembers that
[2:56:00.260 --> 2:56:04.020]  Corpulent cop who walked along just spraying pepper spray
[2:56:04.020 --> 2:56:10.740]  Well, you know at a very close range in these people's faces or they were, you know exercising their right to protest
[2:56:10.740 --> 2:56:17.700]  I don't agree with them, but they have a constitutional right to work being violently assemble and redress their grievances
[2:56:17.700 --> 2:56:19.940]  They were not screaming races of people. They weren't
[2:56:20.340 --> 2:56:23.140]  Uh, vandalizing products or anything like we see now
[2:56:23.700 --> 2:56:28.500]  But that was absolutely outrageous. And of course that guy was put on leave
[2:56:28.580 --> 2:56:33.220]  But he continued to collect his six figure plus salary. So he basically got a paid vacation for that
[2:56:33.220 --> 2:56:39.380]  So you had this situation following that for a couple of days and um, I'm not sure what this picture
[2:56:39.460 --> 2:56:41.460]  Oh, those people were getting sprayed. I guess
[2:56:41.460 --> 2:56:45.460]  Yeah, that's right there. Okay. That's the iconic thing that everybody's talking about
[2:56:45.620 --> 2:56:50.820]  Well, megan kelly goes on below Riley and they're talking about how it was all these people's fault because they
[2:56:51.380 --> 2:56:53.380]  disobeyed the chancellor's orders
[2:56:53.380 --> 2:56:57.780]  Uh, not to assemble there. So that that gave them the right to use that kind of excessive force
[2:56:58.020 --> 2:57:01.220]  and then megan kelly said well, you know pepper spray is essentially a food product
[2:57:01.220 --> 2:57:03.940]  And everybody was outraged with that
[2:57:04.260 --> 2:57:09.380]  Now we could run with this in the same way that she came after alex jones with sandy hook and anything
[2:57:09.620 --> 2:57:14.260]  It's a well, you know, is she insane? Well, she said I was just giving that as a background
[2:57:14.580 --> 2:57:17.060]  But in the real context of that report
[2:57:17.460 --> 2:57:21.460]  They were talking about how this is all justified from a law enforcement standpoint
[2:57:21.780 --> 2:57:23.780]  And of course, it's essentially a food product
[2:57:23.780 --> 2:57:29.780]  So people at time took out a petition and they said to back up your claim that pepper spray is a food product
[2:57:29.780 --> 2:57:36.260]  Please consume as much of it as the sprayed on each professor's face and one sitting on camera at fox news
[2:57:36.340 --> 2:57:39.700]  I spray it on my cova fey every morning when I wake up. That's right. It's delicious
[2:57:41.140 --> 2:57:43.620]  There was even a like a japanese, uh animation
[2:57:44.420 --> 2:57:46.980]  news site that that puts some stuff out having a lot of fun with that
[2:57:46.980 --> 2:57:51.380]  That's kind of like the glyphosate guy. This cube smells really good. But you know what it could use some pepper spray
[2:57:52.100 --> 2:57:55.140]  I think that would really just add maybe some what do you want to dip it in some glyphosate?
[2:57:55.140 --> 2:58:00.500]  Give us some cova fey. Well, you know, the thing is is they there you go. There's the one that looks so much fun
[2:58:00.500 --> 2:58:04.420]  That they did in age or they're talking about how how effective this is and then nice
[2:58:04.660 --> 2:58:06.740]  It's very effective. Yeah and sprayed many times
[2:58:07.140 --> 2:58:08.980]  They are spraying people in the face and they're getting points
[2:58:09.300 --> 2:58:13.220]  But you know, she said things like we all know that santa claus is white and so forth and so on
[2:58:13.460 --> 2:58:17.140]  So if you want to hang somebody by their comments
[2:58:17.700 --> 2:58:21.140]  You could certainly do a hit piece very easily on meghan kelly
[2:58:21.140 --> 2:58:26.900]  Like she did with alec shones taking something an isolated comment take it out of context and hang on it
[2:58:26.900 --> 2:58:31.300]  We don't even need to take her comments out of context when she's talking about pepper spray stuff
[2:58:31.540 --> 2:58:35.620]  When she's talking about santa claus and we all know it would have been very nice to use them bring up
[2:58:35.860 --> 2:58:37.460]  the thing when she was here like
[2:58:37.460 --> 2:58:42.020]  And have you used any food product today for them or just like just like randomly just kind of insert it
[2:58:42.100 --> 2:58:47.220]  Hey, does anyone have any pepper spray? I'm a little hungry here. I wanted to pepper up this uh this dish that I have here
[2:58:47.220 --> 2:58:51.780]  A little pepper spray would be great. Megan. You got any pepper spray? Well, you know, the interesting thing too was
[2:58:52.420 --> 2:58:55.940]  She did a couple of uh different interviews with me in the sense that you know first
[2:58:55.940 --> 2:58:57.940]  She does like a a puff piece interview and then
[2:58:58.500 --> 2:59:02.100]  Pretends that the interview is over they keep the the microphone. Yeah, they tried to do this
[2:59:02.740 --> 2:59:08.900]  Over the shoulder shots and so forth and she tried to get me to say stuff about trump and says well, you must uh pose him on
[2:59:09.460 --> 2:59:14.180]  Uh imminent domain and said oh absolutely and I pose him on things like civil asset forfeiture as well
[2:59:14.180 --> 2:59:17.780]  But I said and she goes civil asset forfeiture. What's that?
[2:59:18.260 --> 2:59:20.100]  She has absolutely no idea what that is
[2:59:20.100 --> 2:59:23.060]  But I said on the things I disagree with him on I just
[2:59:23.700 --> 2:59:28.420]  Uh, we had hillary clinton with exactly the same issues and he brings to the table
[2:59:28.820 --> 2:59:34.020]  Some very important issues that no other candidate republican or democrat was talking about and that's how to stop
[2:59:34.580 --> 2:59:39.700]  The encroachment of global government on taking over our country taking over our economy
[2:59:39.700 --> 2:59:42.900]  That's funny that meg and kelly said that to you when I was saying things about seth rich
[2:59:42.900 --> 2:59:49.700]  She was like clueless to that too. Yeah, she has no idea. She doesn't do any research. She doesn't read anything except the teleprompter
[2:59:49.780 --> 2:59:51.780]  No idea what civil asset forfeiture. She's like a real doll
[2:59:54.580 --> 2:59:59.700]  All right, you know what okay, we're gonna do it meg and kelly's joining us next segment. I'm dead serious meg and kelly in studio
[2:59:59.780 --> 3:00:01.780]  We'll be right back
[3:00:01.940 --> 3:00:03.940]  Thank you for listening to gcm
[3:00:05.220 --> 3:00:07.540]  Visit gcmlive.com today
[3:00:07.540 --> 3:00:15.780]  Not a group you develop living defense for us. It took you over a year to do it. Why is this so good?
[3:00:16.100 --> 3:00:21.300]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most
[3:00:21.380 --> 3:00:26.580]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system
[3:00:26.660 --> 3:00:29.460]  But right now we're dealing with massive
[3:00:30.180 --> 3:00:36.340]  Parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees
[3:00:36.340 --> 3:00:42.420]  Uh spreading disease around we have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites
[3:00:42.500 --> 3:00:46.180]  Tell us about all this episode. There's so many things that are in it. You have the neem in there
[3:00:46.260 --> 3:00:52.660]  You have the organic clove bud the organic wormwood. I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year
[3:00:52.740 --> 3:00:55.700]  All right. Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today
[3:00:55.780 --> 3:01:00.580]  It just came back in yesterday living defense info wars live.com and folks you can't lose full of stuff

[3:01:28.260 --> 3:01:43.700]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:01:45.460 --> 3:01:50.660]  All right, we bring bring her on in bring megan kelly bring megan kelly on in all right
[3:01:51.780 --> 3:01:55.140]  Megan kelly. I wasn't joking megan kelly is now joining us in studio
[3:01:55.140 --> 3:02:00.500]  She wanted to clear it. She wanted to clear the air about the pepper spray comments and she's going to cook us all dinner later
[3:02:01.060 --> 3:02:05.300]  Megan kelly joins us in studio there. You can see she never actually left
[3:02:05.860 --> 3:02:10.260]  Megan kelly never actually left. It's wearing a trump t-shirt. How's everybody doing?
[3:02:10.820 --> 3:02:17.780]  Megan kelly, you're not a journalist. You're not a journalist and you're not making kelly wouldn't be caught dead wearing a trump t-shirt
[3:02:17.780 --> 3:02:23.940]  So that's obviously that's megan kelly. What are you talking about david? It's right there. It's a corpse
[3:02:25.620 --> 3:02:31.220]  Nothing but bone it's megan kelly. And then here's her arm. What are your original thoughts on what's happening right now?
[3:02:31.460 --> 3:02:33.620]  I don't know. I don't see a teleprompter anywhere to read off
[3:02:35.700 --> 3:02:38.260]  Well, you know the interesting thing is we also had this weekend
[3:02:38.820 --> 3:02:40.500]  We had seen banon
[3:02:40.500 --> 3:02:45.620]  Troll the press and they kept saying, you know, why aren't we seeing shan spicer on television?
[3:02:45.620 --> 3:02:51.220]  So because they're they're pulling back the role of the white house press corps that's been operating as a guild
[3:02:51.620 --> 3:02:56.420]  With their little monopoly status and he said well, we pulled him off because shan got fat
[3:02:57.300 --> 3:03:04.500]  And so he's doing that as a joke and then you have chelsea clinton come out and say the white house is using fat shaming to justify increased
[3:03:04.980 --> 3:03:11.700]  Opacity fully trolled and didn't spicer actually get a promotion too. Yeah, well spicer got a promotion
[3:03:11.700 --> 3:03:16.580]  But but seriously, she doesn't recognize sarcasm. I tweeted out is chelsea clinton such a dense
[3:03:16.660 --> 3:03:22.980]  Soflake that she doesn't understand his sarcasm or did her mother's obesity aid her opacity, you know because she never had press
[3:03:23.060 --> 3:03:27.220]  She's not even a good person. She even told wepster. Hubble. Uh, hubble happy father's day
[3:03:28.820 --> 3:03:32.260]  Wow, how rude she told the wrong guy. She's incomplete denial
[3:03:33.060 --> 3:03:38.580]  You know, it's it's amazing because I think that there's been a lot of instances though where either trump tweets something
[3:03:38.580 --> 3:03:41.620]  Or flin says something or there's some
[3:03:42.420 --> 3:03:43.620]  You know
[3:03:43.620 --> 3:03:48.660]  Mitigated thing that gets said and then the left just blows it up. It's a fully troll
[3:03:48.660 --> 3:03:52.420]  They just troll themselves over like a little cofe like cofefe. Yeah, the perfect thing
[3:03:52.580 --> 3:03:57.380]  Like okay, trump tweets out cofefe and then we all kind of love to make a joke of it. It's funny
[3:03:57.460 --> 3:04:02.020]  They freak out about trump's twitter. He's does a cofefe. It's fun. It's a joke. We all laugh and then the left is like
[3:04:02.900 --> 3:04:06.740]  Look at the right. They're crazy. They're joking about cofefe. How could they it's not even real
[3:04:06.740 --> 3:04:11.460]  It's like, yeah, we have a sense of humor. It's funny. You're the ones that freak out about trump's twitter
[3:04:11.620 --> 3:04:14.820]  Chelsea she has absolutely no sense of humor. What did you call her thick as a brick?
[3:04:15.060 --> 3:04:18.900]  Yeah, he is thick as a brick. At least she's not thin as a skeleton like megan
[3:04:19.060 --> 3:04:19.860]  The thing is
[3:04:19.860 --> 3:04:23.700]  Skeletal to have the nerve to say that this is a lack of opacity
[3:04:24.100 --> 3:04:29.780]  When her mother probably holds the record for the fewest press conferences of anybody who's running for president
[3:04:29.860 --> 3:04:32.340]  That's the amazing thing to me. Not only the the
[3:04:32.340 --> 3:04:38.740]  Total humorlessness of this political correctness, but the hypocrisy that she thinks she can get away with
[3:04:39.380 --> 3:04:42.500]  I thought what Steve Bannon did was brilliant. I thought
[3:04:43.220 --> 3:04:47.060]  Isn't that the like the just the overarching story that will never die
[3:04:47.380 --> 3:04:51.460]  Is the blatant hypocrisy of everything that we're seeing the russia investigation?
[3:04:51.540 --> 3:04:55.220]  It was the democrats that colluded with trump russia was mentally in our election
[3:04:55.300 --> 3:05:01.300]  No, that was the democrats or excuse me. The democrats colluding with russia. So it's just like this blatant hypocrisy
[3:05:01.300 --> 3:05:03.300]  And now now the latest is
[3:05:04.500 --> 3:05:06.500]  Chuck Schumer gets on the floor and says
[3:05:07.220 --> 3:05:09.220]  How dare the GOP
[3:05:09.380 --> 3:05:16.580]  Want to pass trump care without even showing us what's in it? How dare they present trump care, but we can't even read the bill
[3:05:17.860 --> 3:05:21.620]  Up chuck schumer the lowest scum in politics perhaps now
[3:05:22.340 --> 3:05:28.580]  That's exactly what you did with obama care and you bragged about it. Jonathan gruber bragged about it. I mean
[3:05:28.580 --> 3:05:32.820]  That's how ignorant they think the american public is
[3:05:33.220 --> 3:05:38.660]  But it is wrong to do that in secret and it is wrong to not have an open discussion. Of course it is
[3:05:39.300 --> 3:05:43.300]  You know, but it's like how can Chuck Schumer say that? Yeah, the republicans need to be better about that
[3:05:43.300 --> 3:05:45.860]  They need to call him on that hypocrisy about that
[3:05:46.260 --> 3:05:51.140]  But they also need to do the right thing and senator rand paul is very upset about that as well
[3:05:51.140 --> 3:05:54.340]  There's a very easy way to get rid of the criminal
[3:05:54.340 --> 3:06:01.060]  Bankruptcy and violation of our rights and the constitution and Jerome course. He laid that out in great detail
[3:06:01.060 --> 3:06:06.580]  This thing is funded on money that has been stolen from fanny and freddy investors
[3:06:06.580 --> 3:06:11.220]  They need to restore that they could shut that down very easily all we have to do is end the appeal
[3:06:11.620 --> 3:06:18.260]  Uh, that is all that they have to do. Thanks meg and kelly for joining us paul joseph watson on the other side
[3:06:18.260 --> 3:06:29.220]  Anarchists and antifa activists continue to engage in sporadic street battles across the country
[3:06:29.300 --> 3:06:36.820]  And they are targeting trump supporters and that means extremism experts are now focusing on the left
[3:06:36.980 --> 3:06:44.980]  Retired lieutenant colonel anthony schaefer recently appeared on fox and friends and gave the mainstream media a dose of the truth
[3:06:44.980 --> 3:06:51.300]  The progressive left has been radicalized and they want a civil war and the pathology is clear
[3:06:51.620 --> 3:06:57.620]  If one side begins to act violently you have inevitably the other side starting to come back it always happens
[3:06:57.700 --> 3:07:01.780]  So we we have to understand if the government does not stop the violence on the left
[3:07:01.780 --> 3:07:09.460]  You'll see more violence on the right and retaliation. It's inevitable. Meanwhile info wars continues to expose how the global elite are

[3:09:40.900 --> 3:09:46.900]  We alive it is the fourth hour of the alex joneshow on this wednesday edition coming up at the bottom of the hour
[3:09:46.900 --> 3:09:51.780]  We've got a couple of guests coming on from the rebel media. They were in attendance at today's
[3:09:52.340 --> 3:09:55.940]  Day of rage leftist temper tantrum in london where the
[3:09:56.660 --> 3:10:01.700]  Corbinistas threatened to overthrow the government didn't actually happen imagine my shock
[3:10:02.180 --> 3:10:06.660]  But they got attacked within 15 minutes of arriving at this protest
[3:10:07.300 --> 3:10:09.300]  Bundled into a police van
[3:10:09.380 --> 3:10:12.420]  Driven out of london simply for challenging
[3:10:12.420 --> 3:10:17.780]  These progressives on their ideas of which they have none. They have no arguments whatsoever
[3:10:17.780 --> 3:10:21.300]  They hold up giant banners saying communist revolutionary party
[3:10:22.340 --> 3:10:27.060]  A pathetic amount turned up. They held a protest in the middle of the day in the middle of the week
[3:10:28.180 --> 3:10:30.180]  Proving once again that they need to get a job
[3:10:31.460 --> 3:10:34.340]  The job going around on twitter was you should have uh, you know
[3:10:34.420 --> 3:10:38.500]  If if you are afraid of these Corbinistas requisitioning your property
[3:10:38.500 --> 3:10:44.740]  Which is what jeremy corbin has called for you should just hang a sign saying job center above it
[3:10:45.140 --> 3:10:47.140]  And that would have scared them off
[3:10:47.140 --> 3:10:49.140]  Like a cross to a vampire
[3:10:49.460 --> 3:10:55.220]  So we're going to get lucy brown and george luelling john on the show at the bottom of the hour to discuss what happened
[3:10:55.620 --> 3:10:59.380]  With them today with the progressive tolerant liberals there in london
[3:11:00.340 --> 3:11:02.820]  But on the subject of progressive tolerant liberals
[3:11:02.820 --> 3:11:08.180]  Euro poll reports. This is the big european union police organization
[3:11:09.060 --> 3:11:14.500]  Their statistics say leftists carried out 27 times more terror attacks than right wingers
[3:11:14.820 --> 3:11:22.340]  A new report by euro poll has revealed that leftists carried out 27 times more terror attacks than right wingers in 2016
[3:11:22.740 --> 3:11:27.460]  Once again debunking claims that the right represents a bigger extremist threat
[3:11:27.460 --> 3:11:34.500]  Which of course we saw again in the aftermath of the attack on the mosque or the attack near the mosque on monday on sunday night
[3:11:34.580 --> 3:11:35.780]  Excuse me
[3:11:35.780 --> 3:11:41.460]  You know, the right is the biggest extremist threat. This just proves it once again. Well, no that's complete bs
[3:11:41.780 --> 3:11:45.620]  You look at the figures in 2016. There was one
[3:11:46.100 --> 3:11:52.900]  Terror attack. Nobody died one terror attack blamed on the right wing in europe for the whole year
[3:11:52.900 --> 3:11:57.860]  The left wing carried out or attempted to carry out at least 27
[3:11:58.260 --> 3:11:59.540]  terror attacks
[3:11:59.540 --> 3:12:06.740]  So you have a factor of 27 to 1 left wing versus right wing, of course, the vast majority of deaths
[3:12:07.620 --> 3:12:11.380]  Were as a result of islamic jihadists religion of peace
[3:12:12.740 --> 3:12:16.260]  So again, just one right wing terror attack was recorded for the entire year
[3:12:17.460 --> 3:12:18.740]  142
[3:12:18.740 --> 3:12:23.380]  Failed foiled and completed terrorist attacks out of which 27 were left wing
[3:12:24.100 --> 3:12:26.580]  So 27 to 1 left versus right wing
[3:12:27.300 --> 3:12:32.260]  13 attacks were blamed on islamic jihadists. The rest were labeled separatist attacks
[3:12:34.100 --> 3:12:39.700]  There were 142 deaths 135 of which were as a result of islamic terror attacks
[3:12:41.380 --> 3:12:47.060]  374 of the 379 injured were due to jihadist terror
[3:12:47.060 --> 3:12:52.340]  So by far the biggest threat in terms of people dying and in terms of terror attacks
[3:12:52.900 --> 3:12:55.540]  R jihadists islamists and leftists
[3:12:56.020 --> 3:13:01.300]  So don't come at me with this crap about the far right being the right the rising threat
[3:13:01.780 --> 3:13:05.860]  In terms of domestic extremism and domestic terrorism. It's the left
[3:13:07.380 --> 3:13:09.380]  Where exactly one week out
[3:13:09.380 --> 3:13:14.740]  Since a far left terrorist radicalized by anti-trump media hysteria
[3:13:14.740 --> 3:13:22.820]  Radicalized by trump russia collusion fake news tried to massacre republicans. That was just a week ago
[3:13:23.220 --> 3:13:25.220]  Nobody's even talking about it anymore
[3:13:25.940 --> 3:13:29.460]  You know, it was it scott pelley came out and said it was trump's fault
[3:13:30.580 --> 3:13:35.540]  You had a trump supporter being stabbed nine times by an armenian muslim gang
[3:13:36.260 --> 3:13:41.620]  Because he supported the president because he had trump paraffinalia on his vehicle
[3:13:41.620 --> 3:13:44.740]  That guy went through surgery. He's still in hospital
[3:13:45.460 --> 3:13:47.460]  If that was the other way around
[3:13:47.460 --> 3:13:54.900]  Imagine if a gang of violent trump supporters had stabbed a muslim nine times and they were in hospital
[3:13:54.900 --> 3:13:59.860]  They were critical. That would be a nationwide news story. There would be absolute
[3:14:00.500 --> 3:14:03.300]  apoplectic outrage and condemnation
[3:14:04.020 --> 3:14:07.300]  And rightly so but it happens the other way around nothing
[3:14:07.300 --> 3:14:13.540]  Absolutely nothing because they're desperate to bury the real narrative of hate crime
[3:14:13.700 --> 3:14:18.260]  Which is the fact that it's being meted out against trump supporters against conservatives
[3:14:18.900 --> 3:14:21.700]  All the time on an almost daily basis now
[3:14:22.180 --> 3:14:24.580]  Then you look at the facts in europe they show they prove
[3:14:25.140 --> 3:14:27.460]  The left is a far bigger terror threat
[3:14:28.420 --> 3:14:31.460]  Now in the u.s. And this is also included in the article
[3:14:31.460 --> 3:14:38.100]  So extremism experts are finally now beginning to realize that the left is a far bigger threat
[3:14:38.900 --> 3:14:45.700]  In terms of domestic extremism brian levine a former nypd officer who now specializes in counter extremism
[3:14:46.180 --> 3:14:48.180]  told vise
[3:14:48.180 --> 3:14:55.380]  Okay, vise not bright but not info wars, but vise who actually did a story on this extremism experts are starting to worry about the left
[3:14:55.380 --> 3:15:01.540]  That he realized the left was a bigger violent threat when he attended a kkk rally at last year as an observer
[3:15:01.780 --> 3:15:08.180]  Not as a member only to find himself having to protect one of the clansmen from being attacked by a member of antifa
[3:15:09.460 --> 3:15:14.340]  At that point I said we have something coalesced coalescing on the hard left said levine
[3:15:14.980 --> 3:15:21.140]  They talked to another counter extremism expert orange seagal the director of the center on extremism
[3:15:21.140 --> 3:15:24.980]  He said I think we're in a time where we can't ignore the extremism from the left
[3:15:26.020 --> 3:15:29.220]  And he was speaking to increased antifa violence
[3:15:29.220 --> 3:15:32.980]  He went on to say quote when we have antifascist counter protests
[3:15:33.460 --> 3:15:37.700]  Not that they are the same as white supremacists that can ratchet up the violence at these events
[3:15:37.940 --> 3:15:39.940]  It means we can see people who are violent
[3:15:40.740 --> 3:15:46.660]  On their own to be attracted to that so they're admitting now in the u.s. The top counter terror experts the main
[3:15:46.660 --> 3:15:54.580]  Concern when it comes to domestic extremism when it comes to domestic terrorism is now the left the figures in Europe back it up
[3:15:54.900 --> 3:15:58.740]  The wave of actual hate crimes against trump supporters in the united states
[3:15:59.460 --> 3:16:02.580]  Over the last six seven months back it up as well
[3:16:03.620 --> 3:16:10.020]  That's the true narrative not the narrative you will hear on the mainstream media where they have one guy
[3:16:11.300 --> 3:16:14.100]  Crash into a group of muslims near a mosque
[3:16:14.100 --> 3:16:17.300]  Crash into a group of muslims near a mosque in london
[3:16:17.780 --> 3:16:23.300]  And suddenly that's the foundation of an entire narrative of this islamophobic hate crime wave
[3:16:23.860 --> 3:16:26.500]  Sweeping britain because the cause of that
[3:16:26.980 --> 3:16:34.260]  Was the numerous islamic terror attacks that have happened in london and manchester over the past three months. That was the cause
[3:16:34.980 --> 3:16:39.620]  No islamophobic backlash to any of those attacks up until that point
[3:16:39.620 --> 3:16:45.700]  That was the cause the cause wasn't the fact that brits are so racist and intolerant
[3:16:48.100 --> 3:16:50.260]  So that's the true narrative that they're not telling you
[3:16:51.140 --> 3:16:57.780]  Also, we have cnn and jim acosta the activist who is posing as a neutral impartial reporter
[3:16:58.260 --> 3:17:04.020]  Literally having a fit on air when he starts whining and complaining about god forbid
[3:17:04.020 --> 3:17:12.020]  Donald trump being asked an equal number of questions from conservative media outlets and mainstream media outlets. Here's the clip
[3:17:12.980 --> 3:17:20.580]  Slowly but surely being dragged into what is a new normal in this country where the president of the united states is allowed to insulate himself
[3:17:20.980 --> 3:17:26.100]  From answering hard questions. He hasn't held it had had a full blown press conference since february
[3:17:26.100 --> 3:17:30.420]  He has these two plus two press conferences with a foreign head of state where you know
[3:17:30.420 --> 3:17:35.540]  Maybe he'll take a question from a conservative news media reporter and then somebody from the mainstream media
[3:17:35.860 --> 3:17:40.420]  It's just this isn't how we do things in this country, but for whatever reason we're all going along with
[3:17:41.780 --> 3:17:44.260]  That's just not how we do things in america
[3:17:44.340 --> 3:17:50.660]  We can't have trump taking an equal amount of questions from conservative and mainstream media. Can we god forbid?
[3:17:51.940 --> 3:17:54.180]  This is a guy who is posing as a reporter
[3:17:54.180 --> 3:18:01.860]  This is the same guy who tweeted out the fake news that donald trump hadn't gone and seen congressman scolese
[3:18:01.860 --> 3:18:04.820]  When he was in hospital after the attack last week
[3:18:05.700 --> 3:18:08.100]  again completely fake news he never
[3:18:09.540 --> 3:18:14.580]  Apologize for it. He just blamed another reporter when initially he said it was a white house source
[3:18:14.900 --> 3:18:20.020]  That had told him that trump didn't go to see scolese in hospital complete lie
[3:18:20.020 --> 3:18:28.180]  Then he's out on cnn again whining and bitching and complaining about god forbid donald trump
[3:18:29.300 --> 3:18:32.820]  Taking equal questions absolutely insane situation
[3:18:33.380 --> 3:18:39.780]  Meanwhile the national referendum on donald trump's first six months in office not my words the words of the new york times
[3:18:40.420 --> 3:18:42.900]  ends in humiliating defeat for leftists
[3:18:42.900 --> 3:18:52.820]  Of course, this was the congressional race in georgia where caron handel beat john ossoff despite being outspent by a margin of seven to one
[3:18:53.940 --> 3:19:02.820]  The democrat spent 22 million on his campaign compared to handel dropping just three million on hers a replay of how trump defeated hillary
[3:19:03.620 --> 3:19:05.620]  Despite being vastly outgunned financially
[3:19:06.580 --> 3:19:09.620]  And of course they had another temper tantrum in reaction to that
[3:19:09.620 --> 3:19:17.380]  Refusing once again to analyze the reason why they lost to look in the mirror to have a moment of self-reflection
[3:19:17.860 --> 3:19:21.620]  Maybe it's the fact that you've got absolutely no policy whatsoever whatsoever
[3:19:22.180 --> 3:19:28.020]  Apart from to point at half the population of america and call them racist and misogynist
[3:19:28.420 --> 3:19:31.780]  Will they ever get to the point where they analyze their own policies?
[3:19:31.780 --> 3:19:39.220]  We shouldn't tell them to i mean they've lost and lost and lost again for the past six seven years
[3:19:39.620 --> 3:19:44.020]  So why should we even be encouraging them to reassess their campaign?
[3:19:45.140 --> 3:19:54.500]  Mayor bloomberg went on uh cnn with anderson cooper and said democrats will lose in 2020 because the party is going to be torn apart
[3:19:54.500 --> 3:19:59.860]  Last night cnn anderson cooper's effort to desperately avoid discussing the democratic debacle
[3:20:00.260 --> 3:20:07.700]  Unfolding in georgia cooper decided to pivot his discussion with mike bloomberg to focus on the 2020 election cycle
[3:20:08.580 --> 3:20:16.900]  so basically bloomberg said trump has a 55 chance of reelection because he's the incumbent he has the advantage the advantage
[3:20:17.620 --> 3:20:22.340]  and bloomberg went on to say the democratic party is going to be torn apart by the left
[3:20:22.340 --> 3:20:31.140]  And the centrist because again they can't coalesce around one focused message. It's all about demonizing the opposition
[3:20:31.620 --> 3:20:36.980]  Through identity politics. It's all about jumping on this failing social justice bandwagon
[3:20:37.460 --> 3:20:43.620]  It's not working. It continues to fail, but they continue to do it and we should be celebrating that fact
[3:20:43.620 --> 3:20:52.580]  We had a terror attack again today in an airport in michigan officers stabbed by man yelling alarack bar at airport fbi investigating possible terror
[3:20:53.380 --> 3:20:58.100]  Isn't it interesting how the report of the attacker at the finsbury mosque came out?
[3:20:58.340 --> 3:21:02.580]  He shouted he wanted to kill all muslims. That was reported by an eyewitness. It was confirmed
[3:21:03.220 --> 3:21:10.740]  Bombshell proof within minutes. This is like, oh, he may have shouted alarack bar. Maybe it's terrorism. Maybe we'll just drop it

[3:27:13.700 --> 3:27:15.700]  delve back into the news of course we had
[3:27:16.980 --> 3:27:19.940]  An attempt to attack in brussels at the train station there
[3:27:19.940 --> 3:27:27.300]  Uh, which I traveled through with joe biggs and uh zimmerman a couple of years ago when we were covering the aftermath of the paris attack
[3:27:27.780 --> 3:27:33.220]  When they were still hunting for the terrorists in molem beak. Guess where this terrorist come from this?
[3:27:34.020 --> 3:27:37.540]  Potential suicide bomber guess where he came from. Oh, it's molem beak
[3:27:38.180 --> 3:27:43.860]  Russell station attacker tried to blow himself up with a nail bomb as he stood next to a group of passengers
[3:27:44.580 --> 3:27:46.580]  Thankfully, he was unsuccessful
[3:27:46.580 --> 3:27:50.740]  They managed to gun gun him down now. He's dead, but another attack
[3:27:51.380 --> 3:27:56.740]  Or attempted attack in europe. We had the sean's alize attempted attack a couple of days ago. It's literally
[3:27:57.300 --> 3:27:59.300]  virtually every day now
[3:28:00.020 --> 3:28:04.660]  But 47 percent believe there's a fundamental clash between islam and british values
[3:28:04.740 --> 3:28:10.500]  This is a uge of poll carried out across the world and in fact if you drill into the stats it shows us
[3:28:11.140 --> 3:28:13.140]  even uh more
[3:28:13.140 --> 3:28:19.700]  Belief that islam is intolerant is uh in uh not able to integrate into western society and values
[3:28:20.020 --> 3:28:23.540]  Britain is slightly less in other countries such as finland. It's higher
[3:28:24.180 --> 3:28:27.140]  But 47 percent of brits believe that islam
[3:28:27.620 --> 3:28:34.100]  Fundamentally clashes with the values of british society with only 23 saying they think islam is compatible with britain
[3:28:34.820 --> 3:28:40.660]  And again, the numbers elsewhere are higher. You've got 60 in finland 59 in demark 59 in norway
[3:28:40.660 --> 3:28:44.420]  56 in sweden all bullet sweden
[3:28:44.980 --> 3:28:50.580]  Can you believe it? I mean the the anti-immigration party in sweden is currently the most popular party
[3:28:50.980 --> 3:28:52.980]  They've got an election coming up next year
[3:28:53.460 --> 3:28:58.260]  Could sweden still save itself and prove itself to be an example for the rest of europe
[3:28:58.820 --> 3:29:02.100]  But this poll again shows there was a poll a couple of months ago
[3:29:03.060 --> 3:29:08.020]  Significant majority of european citizens wanted to shut down muslim immigration entirely
[3:29:08.020 --> 3:29:11.780]  Entirely they wanted a trump style ban
[3:29:12.340 --> 3:29:15.540]  In fact more than a trump style ban because that didn't even include
[3:29:16.340 --> 3:29:22.740]  What five of the nine of the top ten actually most populous muslim countries european citizens went asked
[3:29:23.220 --> 3:29:26.500]  Want to shut it down altogether the majority of them
[3:29:27.140 --> 3:29:31.060]  They all islamophobes they all racist the majority of people living in europe
[3:29:31.700 --> 3:29:33.700]  absolutely incredible
[3:29:33.700 --> 3:29:39.140]  Obama appointed blm activist blames white people for illegal alien murdering muslim girl
[3:29:39.620 --> 3:29:44.100]  So we had this story yesterday. Of course. We pointed out the fact they blamed
[3:29:44.660 --> 3:29:50.580]  Trump supporters for this tragic death of a muslim teen it turned out to be an illegal immigrant from el salvador
[3:29:51.140 --> 3:29:55.700]  The ice had been trying to deport for years even after that came out
[3:29:56.580 --> 3:30:02.100]  Even after it was known that it was an illegal immigrant not a white person not a trump supporter
[3:30:02.100 --> 3:30:06.900]  That didn't stop brit any pack net of life lives matter activists
[3:30:07.140 --> 3:30:12.340]  Who was appointed by obama to take part in the president's 21st century policing task force?
[3:30:13.220 --> 3:30:16.420]  From blaming white people for this illegal immigrants alleged actions
[3:30:17.140 --> 3:30:23.460]  She wrote on twitter quote if you have trouble understanding why a person of color should could abduct and murder
[3:30:23.780 --> 3:30:27.860]  nabra hussain go learn about internalize and transfer depression
[3:30:27.860 --> 3:30:32.740]  So even though it was an illegal immigrant non-white
[3:30:33.700 --> 3:30:40.500]  He abducted and killed her because of white people because obviously he had somehow absorbed by proxy
[3:30:40.820 --> 3:30:44.180]  Their inherent racism and hatred for muslims
[3:30:44.740 --> 3:30:48.020]  So no matter what happens even if it's an illegal immigrant
[3:30:48.580 --> 3:30:52.260]  Murdering somebody they still find a way to blame white
[3:30:52.260 --> 3:30:58.180]  People because they're demented because they're intersectionalists and that's just how they roll
[3:30:58.820 --> 3:31:00.100]  their races
[3:31:00.100 --> 3:31:02.100]  But the fact it's the alex jones show live
[3:31:03.220 --> 3:31:06.340]  rebel media film crew mobbed by
[3:31:06.900 --> 3:31:13.700]  Leftists of the day of rape protests in london will be back stay tuned. We're on the march the empires on the run
[3:31:14.580 --> 3:31:17.460]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[3:31:17.460 --> 3:31:25.140]  Leftists in europe carried out 27 terror attacks in 2016
[3:31:25.860 --> 3:31:32.260]  Which debunks a claim that conservatives and libertarians represent a bigger extremist threat over 140 terrorist attacks occurred in europe last year
[3:31:32.500 --> 3:31:35.300]  And 27 of them were blamed on leftists in comparison
[3:31:35.460 --> 3:31:41.460]  Just one right-wing terror attack was recorded for the entire year 13 attacks were blamed on jihadis while the majority of the attacks
[3:31:41.460 --> 3:31:48.100]  Nearly 100 were by separatist movements terrorist attacks, which led to deaths and injuries are almost exclusively islamic
[3:31:48.260 --> 3:31:53.300]  And guess who advocates open borders and radical islam is the left the statistics
[3:31:53.380 --> 3:31:57.220]  Disprove the narrative that conservatives and libertarians represent a major terrorist threat
[3:31:57.380 --> 3:32:01.220]  A claim the major media was pushing after the recent attack on muslims near moscow in london
[3:32:01.300 --> 3:32:06.820]  The study came from europe hole law enforcement agency of the european union tasked with combating organized crime and terrorism
[3:32:06.820 --> 3:32:12.820]  Additionally terror experts in the u.s. Are also warning that left-wing terror represents a far bigger concern than ever before
[3:32:12.980 --> 3:32:19.780]  Which isn't surprising given how the establishment keeps promoting violence against president trump. You can find out more at info wars dot com

[3:33:28.180 --> 3:33:31.940]  The very best systems that god gave us through mother nature to detoxify the body

[3:34:58.740 --> 3:35:03.860]  Their goal was to overthrow the government. That's what they actually said before this march took place
[3:35:04.340 --> 3:35:10.500]  Didn't quite happen like that, but we're going to find out what happened during today's day of rage in london
[3:35:10.500 --> 3:35:18.980]  And we have george louellen john and lucy brown cameraman and contributor for the rebel dot media who were there today
[3:35:19.380 --> 3:35:21.380]  Welcome to the show guys

[3:35:41.620 --> 3:35:46.820]  Well, we were actually just scoping out the scenes. Um, we we we hadn't even started reporting yet
[3:35:46.820 --> 3:35:51.700]  And there were a few guys who were kind of on our side who were doing a bit of live debating
[3:35:51.780 --> 3:35:57.620]  So we started filming them. Um, so they were the ones that were attacked and then of course I had the rebel microphone
[3:35:58.100 --> 3:36:03.620]  Um, so as soon as I don't know as soon as people saw that they kind of started whispering to each other where I got
[3:36:03.620 --> 3:36:05.620]  Round, of course, I'm white
[3:36:05.700 --> 3:36:10.340]  I mean the whole the whole thing took about uh in and out in about 15 minutes. We um

[3:36:13.380 --> 3:36:18.340]  They they chased those guys right out of parliament square kind of a pretty much the whole protest kind of chased them out
[3:36:18.580 --> 3:36:21.300]  You know 100 so who were the guys that they were chasing again?
[3:36:21.860 --> 3:36:25.220]  They were from a youtube channel called makes pretty great again

[3:36:33.940 --> 3:36:36.260]  Nazis were they wearing any kind of caps or
[3:36:36.820 --> 3:36:38.820]  God forbid a british flag
[3:36:38.820 --> 3:36:42.260]  Trying to have a discussion. Um, yeah, they literally just said that uh
[3:36:42.980 --> 3:36:45.940]  You know, it was a kind of a cross-party issue and not a you know
[3:36:46.020 --> 3:36:49.540]  It was kind of a governmental issue rather than a political issue. Uh, and they were just
[3:36:50.340 --> 3:36:55.620]  I've never seen anything like it. They were just screamed up. Yeah. I mean Kensington is a labour counselor. Is that right a labour MP?
[3:36:56.660 --> 3:36:58.660]  That's what I was saying. Yeah
[3:36:58.660 --> 3:37:06.020]  So they had the temerity to engage in a civil discussion with these people and for that they were chased out of town, right?
[3:37:06.740 --> 3:37:10.900]  Yeah, so we uh, we we kind of followed them with a camera. Obviously trying to get that get that footage
[3:37:11.380 --> 3:37:16.180]  Uh, and then they kind of chased them up parliament square and then one of them came back started talking to Lucy and saying
[3:37:16.260 --> 3:37:21.380]  Oh, but you guys are fascists aren't you and you can kind of see them all looking around looking for the next the next victim
[3:37:21.780 --> 3:37:23.780]  they kind of uh, you know
[3:37:24.420 --> 3:37:27.300]  Get their sights on us and they're just straight in there straight away
[3:37:27.300 --> 3:37:29.300]  They're all lined up
[3:37:29.700 --> 3:37:36.660]  They were on alert for for fascists god forbid people with different opinions to try and like almost literally lynch them
[3:37:36.980 --> 3:37:40.340]  You were there for what you said about 15 minutes. What happened next?
[3:37:41.220 --> 3:37:46.820]  Um, they formed they obviously they attacked george's equipment, which is like the second time this week that's that's happened
[3:37:46.820 --> 3:37:51.700]  It's not it's started. I was wearing this hat. Um, probably not the best idea
[3:37:51.780 --> 3:37:53.460]  But you know with with the weather we're having at the moment
[3:37:53.460 --> 3:37:57.860]  I kind of just wanted to keep it simple and they they this guy just ripped that rips the hat straight off
[3:37:58.340 --> 3:38:00.820]  I uh, probably quite stupidly just went straight after him
[3:38:01.220 --> 3:38:04.340]  Uh, find myself in the middle of it all and then kind of Lucy's coming after me and
[3:38:04.740 --> 3:38:09.780]  Well, it's actually my hat. So I wasn't gonna let them pick it. It's one of my favorite hats. It really triggers people
[3:38:10.340 --> 3:38:16.740]  Um, but yeah, they just went straight for george and then and then they they cornered me and uh, they formed like a circle
[3:38:16.820 --> 3:38:22.420]  Literally it's like a stonehenge around me. Um, and they kept pushing you know how they kind of push you and say
[3:38:22.420 --> 3:38:25.780]  It's probably best for you to go. So I was standing there go. I'm not going. I'm not going
[3:38:25.780 --> 3:38:28.340]  Oh, it's chuckling isn't it? It's basically what the police do
[3:38:29.220 --> 3:38:34.100]  Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I mean Lucy called it a metaphorical stoning when we were in a in the police van on the way out
[3:38:34.100 --> 3:38:38.820]  Because they uh, they had to escort us out and and I think it's absolutely right. It really really was a metaphorical stoning
[3:38:38.820 --> 3:38:41.780]  I had that I even had someone like barging into me and then
[3:38:42.660 --> 3:38:45.940]  Uh, yeah, that that was in the police van. So they kind of had to had to take us out
[3:38:45.940 --> 3:38:53.460]  Uh, kind of how I literally had to bundle you into a police van because you tried to have a conversation with some of these people
[3:38:54.020 --> 3:38:59.620]  It's our fault because we were inciting hatred and we were disturbing the peace and it's the same with the make britain great
[3:38:59.620 --> 3:39:04.580]  Again guys, one of them actually got a cut on his head and he went up to a police officer and explained that someone had hit him
[3:39:04.580 --> 3:39:08.820]  Over the head of the flagpole and they said well, it's your fault for turning up and inciting hatred
[3:39:09.620 --> 3:39:14.020]  Yeah, I'm having having your own opinion is inciting hatred now in britain
[3:39:14.020 --> 3:39:20.340]  So they weren't actually bundling you away for your own protection really it was because you'd done something wrong
[3:39:20.420 --> 3:39:22.420]  That was the implication
[3:39:22.500 --> 3:39:25.380]  Yeah, pretty much. I mean, I mean the sad thing is we went along we um
[3:39:25.700 --> 3:39:31.060]  We've got a video that's just been out on the rebel, uh in the last hour from from granthal where we went down a couple of days ago
[3:39:31.540 --> 3:39:35.940]  Uh, and what we saw there was this actually like a really great scene of kind of people coming together
[3:39:36.420 --> 3:39:41.860]  uh, you know the six were there kind of uh giving out food everyone was kind of trying to sign off to volunteer and it was this
[3:39:41.860 --> 3:39:46.740]  Actually quite a surprisingly kind of positive community vibe and then I think you know
[3:39:47.060 --> 3:39:50.900]  There were very few people actually from granthal that today because today was just
[3:39:51.620 --> 3:39:54.740]  Anger and hostility and we were trying to say to people actually, you know
[3:39:55.380 --> 3:40:00.500]  We do believe that these people have been failed on on quite a quite a huge level and something's going wrong somewhere
[3:40:00.580 --> 3:40:03.780]  And people need to be held accountable, but they just weren't interested. They just
[3:40:04.580 --> 3:40:07.220]  Saw the heart saw the rebel mic and that that was it
[3:40:07.220 --> 3:40:16.980]  Well, it's interesting because there were comments about granthal from one of the charities representing some of the victims there before this protest took place
[3:40:17.620 --> 3:40:22.660]  Basically distancing themselves from it saying we don't endorse anything that's going to happen with this protest
[3:40:22.980 --> 3:40:25.540]  So as you said, it looks like it's a different group of people
[3:40:25.780 --> 3:40:33.940]  It's these carbonista types these antiphytypes that are hijacking the poor situation that these people find themselves in hijacking the grief
[3:40:33.940 --> 3:40:41.380]  To pursue their own their own aim, which in their own words before this protest was to overthrow the government
[3:40:41.620 --> 3:40:43.620]  I mean, why would you come out with such an insane
[3:40:44.260 --> 3:40:48.580]  Aim for a protest which is clearly not going to happen unless you're going to try and cause violence
[3:40:49.060 --> 3:40:54.820]  Thankfully nothing happened. I mean that I've seen pictures of them getting up and screaming in police officers faces
[3:40:54.900 --> 3:40:58.020]  Did you see much of that? Did you see much anger a little bit?
[3:40:58.100 --> 3:41:02.340]  I mean before we even arrived there we were kind of checking twitter when we were on our way over and it was just constantly kind of
[3:41:02.340 --> 3:41:04.500]  arrests arrests arrests and we got there
[3:41:04.900 --> 3:41:08.180]  Surprised how small it was because you know, usually the arrests these things are huge
[3:41:08.740 --> 3:41:10.740]  And not very good at organizing things
[3:41:10.820 --> 3:41:11.780]  Yeah, no, absolutely
[3:41:11.780 --> 3:41:15.620]  But it really was just it's a hardcore group and they were just going after anyone like I said after they
[3:41:15.860 --> 3:41:20.100]  After they chased these guys out they just turned and they're like attack dogs just looking for the next
[3:41:20.660 --> 3:41:25.140]  You know, it's not a case of oh, this person's done something to piss me off. I'll go after them
[3:41:25.460 --> 3:41:28.580]  They're looking for somebody to go after they're looking for someone to kind of
[3:41:28.580 --> 3:41:33.300]  Just just shout down and attack. I mean, I had one guy this kind of middle-aged Scottish guy
[3:41:33.380 --> 3:41:36.580]  Looks like it could just be anyone's dad looked completely kind of innocuous
[3:41:36.660 --> 3:41:40.180]  And then suddenly when when the police is back then comes up to me and just does into my ear
[3:41:40.340 --> 3:41:42.340]  You're gonna die today, mate
[3:41:42.420 --> 3:41:44.420]  Um, and I'm just thinking like
[3:41:44.500 --> 3:41:46.500]  Bloody hell. I'm literally I'm here with a camera
[3:41:46.740 --> 3:41:49.940]  Um, you know, I'm here with Lucy. We're trying to have a conversation with people
[3:41:50.580 --> 3:41:55.780]  Um, and it's just this this horrible horrible aggression that just it's not a counter protest
[3:41:55.780 --> 3:42:02.020]  It's not a protest about democracy or the government even it's just these people who are saying we want things our way
[3:42:02.180 --> 3:42:06.100]  And we're gonna be violent and aggressive and nasty until we get it
[3:42:07.140 --> 3:42:13.860]  I mean, we've we've got the photographs up on info wards.com literally they have huge banners saying communist revolutionary party
[3:42:14.340 --> 3:42:18.420]  They talk to people they say you wanted to overthrow the government today. How are you gonna do that?
[3:42:18.500 --> 3:42:22.500]  They've got no idea what they're talking about. Do they have any kind of coherent message?
[3:42:22.500 --> 3:42:27.620]  I mean, what kind of signs did you see? Was there any kind of coherent aim to this protest?
[3:42:27.620 --> 3:42:29.620]  Or was it just a huge temper tantrum?
[3:42:30.900 --> 3:42:32.900]  Tory's out Tory system
[3:42:33.780 --> 3:42:35.780]  May may is bad
[3:42:36.020 --> 3:42:37.220]  What else?
[3:42:37.220 --> 3:42:40.660]  It was basic. I mean, it was just your usual kind of socialist workers
[3:42:41.140 --> 3:42:44.900]  Uh, you know the placards that they hand out everywhere. Yes socialist workers party
[3:42:44.900 --> 3:42:49.700]  They always turn up everywhere and they have these stalls and they just give out these these signs to people
[3:42:49.700 --> 3:42:55.060]  They have so many signs that people just come and they just hand them out like I know like three kinds of coax
[3:42:55.060 --> 3:42:58.260]  So people just pick them up and start wandering around with this sign. They don't even know what it says
[3:42:58.820 --> 3:43:02.580]  So, I know I don't think half people they're probably even new and then there was that
[3:43:02.820 --> 3:43:07.300]  There's that one we saw a picture of it and I caught a glimpse of it the um, to reason they stuck your mum
[3:43:08.980 --> 3:43:11.460]  What the hell are these people doing like there's no
[3:43:11.700 --> 3:43:13.380]  Doesn't even make sense
[3:43:13.380 --> 3:43:17.620]  I mean the other thing was this was in the middle of the week. It was in the middle of the day
[3:43:17.620 --> 3:43:23.380]  This isn't a national holiday as far as I know, you know, I mean you could have worn like badgers pretending
[3:43:23.380 --> 3:43:28.260]  You were working for the job centre and they would have probably avoided you like like the plague, right?
[3:43:29.060 --> 3:43:33.140]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely. But I mean, uh, I mean how how can they
[3:43:33.620 --> 3:43:40.340]  Expect to get large groups of people on at 1 p.m. On a wednesday afternoon. It just sounds very dumb to me
[3:43:41.060 --> 3:43:46.100]  Everything in there in their world is just they think everyone's like that. They're so confused
[3:43:46.100 --> 3:43:49.940]  I don't know they're absolutely not the most kind of intelligent or logical of people
[3:43:50.100 --> 3:43:52.260]  So what we were calling in britain a waste man
[3:43:53.460 --> 3:43:55.300]  Yeah, yeah, pretty much. I mean
[3:43:55.300 --> 3:43:59.380]  They just think we want to kind of blame the system for everything and they don't they don't they don't care really
[3:43:59.620 --> 3:44:01.940]  I think about organizing an actual movement or
[3:44:02.900 --> 3:44:06.500]  Or pressure or kind of creating pressure groups or anything like that or actual demonstrations
[3:44:06.580 --> 3:44:11.380]  They just want to go out and scream at people or shout at people and like you say throw a throw a huge temper tantrum
[3:44:11.380 --> 3:44:14.980]  And do you think that's largely based in just virtue singling order?
[3:44:14.980 --> 3:44:21.140]  They actually believe that they're going up against this oppressive group of fascists and they're on the moral high ground
[3:44:21.140 --> 3:44:23.140]  Do you think it's it's one or the other?
[3:44:23.140 --> 3:44:28.580]  I think it's a bit of both. I think that when you see people get triggered. It's a very psychological thing that's happening
[3:44:28.580 --> 3:44:34.500]  It's like kind of uh, their brain just can't comprehend that that what they believe might might be wrong
[3:44:34.500 --> 3:44:36.500]  It's like a chip isn't it and they're kind of
[3:44:36.500 --> 3:44:41.780]  But you know, I think one thing I'm noticing now from kind of going to these things with the cameras
[3:44:41.780 --> 3:44:44.900]  It's the they're happy to let people on their side film and
[3:44:45.540 --> 3:44:50.420]  Whenever we turn up with a camera, they're trying to break the camera, you know, again, like I'll quiz the other day
[3:44:51.140 --> 3:44:54.420]  Today they try to rip the lens off the camera try to rip out the sound equipment
[3:44:54.980 --> 3:44:56.100]  Um
[3:44:56.100 --> 3:44:59.700]  They they know what they're doing and they know on some level that what they're doing is wrong
[3:45:00.180 --> 3:45:02.660]  Because why why else wouldn't they want them to be video footage of it?
[3:45:02.660 --> 3:45:04.660]  Why else wouldn't they want to be seen on camera?
[3:45:04.660 --> 3:45:07.620]  Doing these things. There's one guy who's screaming at Lucy, you know
[3:45:08.100 --> 3:45:12.900]  Right up in her face and he kind of grabbed my camera almost ripped out of my hands and tried to throw it on the floor
[3:45:13.380 --> 3:45:17.460]  Now there's people on that side who are doing that, but they know that that footage isn't going to grow out anywhere
[3:45:17.540 --> 3:45:20.820]  So why are they trying to stop the people who are going to put the footage out?
[3:45:21.540 --> 3:45:25.060]  You know to stop them from putting out and it's it's because they know they go with the intention of
[3:45:25.860 --> 3:45:27.860]  Of causing trouble
[3:45:27.860 --> 3:45:31.700]  Well, exactly. I mean criminals don't want to be identified. Do they that's why they wear masks
[3:45:31.700 --> 3:45:34.340]  That's why they insist that nobody films their behavior
[3:45:34.820 --> 3:45:39.540]  Um, um as well as the fact that it just doesn't resonate with anyone and that shows with the numbers
[3:45:39.860 --> 3:45:41.860]  I mean, I don't know what they were expecting
[3:45:42.100 --> 3:45:45.940]  But the final picture that I saw when they were marching to parliament
[3:45:46.180 --> 3:45:52.580]  It was a pathetic amount of people. It was probably less than 200 people for a supposed major march
[3:45:52.820 --> 3:46:00.500]  Which had got mainstream media attention for days before they could barely get 200 people out there in a capital city
[3:46:00.500 --> 3:46:03.620]  I mean, does that show how little their message is resonating?
[3:46:04.180 --> 3:46:08.500]  I mean, there were genuinely more tourists on parliament square today than there were
[3:46:09.220 --> 3:46:13.460]  Uh, it kind of made me laugh actually when they were bundling us into a police van because they had kind of
[3:46:14.020 --> 3:46:17.300]  Uh, a handful of police vans on my side and I decided parliament square
[3:46:18.020 --> 3:46:20.660]  And I was just thinking that the police have way over estimated
[3:46:21.140 --> 3:46:25.540]  You know, how many people are going to be here there were there were officers everywhere probably pretty much one for every
[3:46:25.540 --> 3:46:31.540]  Every protester and it it just kind of looked quite sad as we were driving away really just kind of you know
[3:46:32.020 --> 3:46:35.540]  Felt sorry for them more than anything these these idiots who were turning up and
[3:46:36.420 --> 3:46:40.420]  You know, it's just them and a couple of mates and that's it and no one really is going to listen. No one cares
[3:46:41.860 --> 3:46:47.780]  So they bundled you into the van. You said they drove you out of london entirely. Is that correct or outside of central london?
[3:46:48.900 --> 3:46:53.780]  Safe space and just dropped us off. Yeah, so they uh, yeah, they kind of took us out of out central london
[3:46:53.780 --> 3:46:56.500]  Uh dropped us off and kind of just said on your way
[3:46:57.060 --> 3:47:00.180]  Um, but we had a few interesting chats with them. Um
[3:47:00.980 --> 3:47:06.260]  Again, this is what we're kind of realizing whenever we're doing these rebel videos that most of the kind of ordinary police guys are on our side
[3:47:06.740 --> 3:47:10.260]  Um, and they you know, a few of them expressed regret at kind of having to
[3:47:10.980 --> 3:47:15.700]  Having to step in and you know whisk us away rather than kind of being able to do everything else
[3:47:15.780 --> 3:47:18.820]  but I suppose when it's a volatile situation like that they kind of
[3:47:19.540 --> 3:47:20.980]  They kind of have to
[3:47:20.980 --> 3:47:23.460]  Just to kind of stop anything anything major kicking off
[3:47:24.980 --> 3:47:30.820]  Yeah, I mean there was another video of them, um jeering at troops who were having a drink in a in a you know
[3:47:31.380 --> 3:47:35.220]  Soldiers club up in in one of the uh, the balconies there. I saw that as well
[3:47:35.540 --> 3:47:37.540]  also wanted to ask you about the
[3:47:37.780 --> 3:47:43.540]  Fallout from tommy robinson's appearance on uh, I think it was a good morning britain yesterday with piers morgan
[3:47:43.940 --> 3:47:46.580]  I don't think piers morgan was quite prepared
[3:47:46.580 --> 3:47:52.580]  For the backlash that he got given he was so confident that he had roasted tommy robinson
[3:47:52.900 --> 3:47:56.980]  Didn't quite turn out that way in the in the court of public opinion did it afterwards?
[3:47:57.460 --> 3:48:01.300]  I mean even even after I think it's part of when he went in all guns blazing because even after he um
[3:48:01.620 --> 3:48:04.580]  Put out his article kind of blame blaming tommy for everything
[3:48:05.140 --> 3:48:09.300]  Um, he even tweeted the night before and he said, you know, there's a disturbing amount of support
[3:48:09.300 --> 3:48:15.860]  So he kind of went into that into you knowing kind of how popular tommy was but I think even so he wasn't he wasn't prepared for a lot of that
[3:48:15.860 --> 3:48:21.860]  Uh, you know kaolin was telling me this morning. Uh, that he he was on the show this morning
[3:48:22.660 --> 3:48:23.460]  um
[3:48:23.460 --> 3:48:28.420]  Trying to kind of almost basically say that oh, maybe I went too far. Maybe I went in too much and apparently this time off
[3:48:28.420 --> 3:48:29.940]  I went straight to the news
[3:48:29.940 --> 3:48:33.060]  Uh, I wanted to cut back to him everything was kind of just going on as normal
[3:48:34.580 --> 3:48:38.660]  It's incredible. I mean it really blew up in his face, especially when he started trying to claim that
[3:48:39.300 --> 3:48:42.260]  You know the the the bible contains more violence
[3:48:42.260 --> 3:48:47.700]  Guys, I don't I don't I must have missed the news story where you have a terror army of christians
[3:48:48.100 --> 3:48:53.940]  Literally beheading people across the world causing mass numbers of christian refugees to flee countries
[3:48:54.260 --> 3:48:55.380]  I missed that part
[3:48:55.380 --> 3:49:02.100]  I missed that part where people are trying to blow themselves up in in brussels train stations based on bible passages
[3:49:02.260 --> 3:49:06.020]  I missed the part where people are running down people on bridges and
[3:49:06.020 --> 3:49:13.140]  Blowing limbs off little girls based on something they read in the old testament. I must have missed those news stories guys
[3:49:13.140 --> 3:49:14.740]  Did you see them?
[3:49:14.740 --> 3:49:21.060]  I think the biggest threat at the moment to western civilization is the west robatist church because those guys
[3:49:21.540 --> 3:49:26.980]  Are seriously, I mean we're in some serious trouble. They they are, you know, they're killing us
[3:49:27.700 --> 3:49:32.340]  Every day another attack. I you know, I think it's it's almost not so much just an attack on tommy
[3:49:32.340 --> 3:49:36.420]  I think it's attack on an attack on all of us and it's you know, all of what we're doing
[3:49:36.420 --> 3:49:40.340]  You know, I've been I've been told today that apparently there are notes going around about it kind of advising
[3:49:40.900 --> 3:49:46.340]  All of all of the mainstream media to use certain words now specifically actually instructions to do so
[3:49:47.140 --> 3:49:52.180]  Whenever talking about all of us and it's because they're scared. They know they know that they know that there's a number
[3:49:52.260 --> 3:49:56.420]  They know that there isn't them. They are numbers. They are numbers. You should be scared
[3:49:56.580 --> 3:50:01.860]  Yeah, they absolutely they should they should be terrified and they are but what they're doing is they're just doing these attacks
[3:50:01.860 --> 3:50:06.180]  And you know like like pierced pierced it on tommy and it's it's backfiring on them
[3:50:06.180 --> 3:50:11.540]  They're just going to carry on doing more and more of the same stuff and they don't realize that they're just digging their own grave
[3:50:11.540 --> 3:50:16.180]  And all we have to do is keep doing what we do and keep telling the truth and just let them do it for us
[3:50:16.340 --> 3:50:18.340]  Yeah, it's great
[3:50:18.900 --> 3:50:22.180]  It's massively backfiring and they're having to cover their tracks today
[3:50:22.500 --> 3:50:28.020]  The bbc had to change something they put out about islamophobia where they said islam means peace
[3:50:28.020 --> 3:50:34.260]  Well, it doesn't it means submission. They had to change that you'll notice guys that after the attack near the mosque on monday
[3:50:34.740 --> 3:50:39.940]  Within minutes they were reporting. He said I want to kill as many muslims as I can they trusted the eyewitness
[3:50:39.940 --> 3:50:41.940]  They reported it fair enough
[3:50:42.100 --> 3:50:48.580]  Same thing didn't happen after that stabbing a few weeks ago in london did it where they were chanting alla alla as they were stabbing
[3:50:48.580 --> 3:50:51.540]  The the woman then they actually covered it up
[3:50:51.540 --> 3:50:59.140]  The bbc censored an eyewitness saying that these individuals said alla during the stabbing that didn't go out on air
[3:50:59.540 --> 3:51:03.380]  But the fact that he said I want to kill all muslims that goes out on air immediately
[3:51:03.460 --> 3:51:08.740]  That's trusted so there's a huge cover-up going on with the bbc after every single terror attack
[3:51:09.300 --> 3:51:12.580]  You know, it's it's it's on all sides. I mean look at kind of Diane Abbott
[3:51:12.580 --> 3:51:14.580]  She went in straight away calling it a terrorist attack
[3:51:15.380 --> 3:51:18.100]  And then kind of london bridge west minstrel of that they were just incidents
[3:51:18.100 --> 3:51:23.620]  So it's it's kind of this complete. I think they've completely revealed their hypocrisy about it because you know
[3:51:24.180 --> 3:51:27.940]  Where all the news articles about you know, be be careful not to be you know
[3:51:29.140 --> 3:51:31.940]  Prejudiced against white people now. Let's not go out and do attacks on white people
[3:51:31.940 --> 3:51:35.860]  You know, we mustn't do that. There's none of that because they know that it's all bullshit
[3:51:35.860 --> 3:51:38.260]  They know the Islamophobia thing is just made up so
[3:51:39.300 --> 3:51:41.540]  They're not going to make it up when you know when it suits them
[3:51:41.540 --> 3:51:48.340]  So they're not going to use it unless it kind of suits what they want to push and they've they've just completely highlighted the hypocrisy and all of it
[3:51:48.340 --> 3:51:52.980]  Exactly. We've got 20 seconds left. George and Lucy just tell people why they can find you on twitter and youtube

[3:55:32.500 --> 3:55:36.900]  Final segment of the fourth hour before we get back into more news
[3:55:36.900 --> 3:55:40.500]  I just want to touch upon cnn right now because they've put out a tweet about this
[3:55:40.500 --> 3:55:48.660]  Stabbing in the airport there in michigan. We know from eyewitness reports that the terrorist said a la akbar as he was
[3:55:48.740 --> 3:55:52.740]  Stabbing this police officer in the neck cnn comes out with a tweet
[3:55:53.220 --> 3:55:59.220]  Preliminary indications on michigan airport suspects said something in arabic before stabbing officer
[3:55:59.700 --> 3:56:01.460]  officials say
[3:56:01.460 --> 3:56:07.300]  No, we know what he said. It was reported hours and hours ago by all the eyewitnesses. This is what I mean
[3:56:07.300 --> 3:56:12.580]  This is what I'm talking about when they report for example after the musk attack
[3:56:13.060 --> 3:56:18.740]  Immediately he said I want to kill as many muslims as possible. They trusted the eyewitnesses
[3:56:18.980 --> 3:56:22.180]  They reported the quote fair enough, but you flip it round
[3:56:22.820 --> 3:56:27.940]  He had the stabbing in london a few weeks ago three muslim women attack another woman with knives
[3:56:28.340 --> 3:56:33.220]  Start stabbing her starts screaming about a la they interview one of the eyewitnesses for the attack
[3:56:33.220 --> 3:56:40.660]  They cut out and I made a video on this they cut out. They censor the part where she says the attack has said our
[3:56:42.180 --> 3:56:48.820]  CNN in this case. Oh, he said something in arabic. We may never know we may never know his motivation
[3:56:49.220 --> 3:56:51.220]  It was reported hours ago
[3:56:51.780 --> 3:56:53.780]  Again, that's soft censorship
[3:56:54.180 --> 3:56:57.380]  They just say yeah, you may have said something arabic. We'll we'll let you know
[3:56:57.380 --> 3:57:03.860]  Next day, everybody's forgotten about it. This is what they do every single time. It's despicable and it's an agenda

[3:57:43.620 --> 3:57:48.660]  Few final news stories here didn't get to this yesterday, but it's an important story
[3:57:48.660 --> 3:57:53.300]  Muslim peace march against terrorism attracts more journalists than participants
[3:57:53.780 --> 3:57:55.780]  Now this was in cologne, germany
[3:57:56.740 --> 3:57:59.700]  On the weekend. They said they were expecting 10
[3:58:00.660 --> 3:58:04.820]  thousand Muslims to show up and march against islamic terrorism
[3:58:05.220 --> 3:58:07.220]  How many showed up?
[3:58:07.220 --> 3:58:09.460]  300 most of them journalists
[3:58:10.420 --> 3:58:12.420]  300
[3:58:12.500 --> 3:58:15.860]  The so-called muslim peace march against terrorism was organized in cologne
[3:58:15.860 --> 3:58:20.260]  But it drew far fewer participants than the organizers had hoped for
[3:58:21.060 --> 3:58:27.940]  Most of them were German the social democratic politicians said there were more journalists and policemen than protesters
[3:58:28.980 --> 3:58:32.500]  So that's how much they're interested in decrying terrorism
[3:58:33.220 --> 3:58:36.500]  again, you have to sympathize with them to some degree because
[3:58:37.460 --> 3:58:43.860]  If they do decry terrorism and that paints a target on their back in many cases because these communities are ghettoized
[3:58:43.860 --> 3:58:46.420]  They're radicalized, but that just is a
[3:58:47.140 --> 3:58:49.700]  Blinding example of the problem that we have
[3:58:50.500 --> 3:58:56.340]  Of course the initial reports. Oh 10,000 Muslims are going to show up for an anti-terror march. Oh my god
[3:58:56.340 --> 3:58:58.580]  that completely dismantles the narrative that
[3:58:59.540 --> 3:59:04.740]  There isn't enough of an element calling out the extremist element within their community
[3:59:05.700 --> 3:59:10.980]  That's reported widely the march actually happens. Nobody shows up. Everybody forgets about it
[3:59:10.980 --> 3:59:13.540]  That's what happens every single time
[3:59:15.220 --> 3:59:18.180]  Woman 28 is raped nine times by three asylum
[3:59:18.660 --> 3:59:23.380]  asylum seekers who filmed the brutal attack on their mobile phone after ambushing her at a town fair in
[3:59:23.940 --> 3:59:25.940]  You guessed it Germany
[3:59:26.340 --> 3:59:31.060]  Who was invited in two million muslim refugees a tearful woman broke down in court in germany
[3:59:31.140 --> 3:59:36.900]  It's she alleged that three asylum seekers raped her a total of nine times when she was ambushed at a town fair
[3:59:36.900 --> 3:59:43.140]  So that's going through the court still probably claimed to be 15 years old like happens every time
[3:59:43.140 --> 3:59:46.820]  They'll probably get away with a slap on the wrist like happens almost every time
[3:59:47.220 --> 3:59:52.820]  YouTube's a pro-refugee propaganda video by the way not doing too well go and see the downvotes on that
[3:59:52.820 --> 4:00:07.220]  That's going to wrap it up for the show though info wars nightly news coming up breaking news at info wars dot com
