[00:00.000 --> 00:13.640]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex
[00:13.640 --> 00:35.960]  Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones welcome ladies
[00:35.960 --> 00:43.560]  and gentlemen welcome and thank you so much for joining us I can't believe the
[00:43.560 --> 00:51.920]  news that's in my stacked today I just can't believe it but it only confirms
[00:51.920 --> 00:59.680]  our worst fears about government gonna break down all the top stories here in
[00:59.680 --> 01:08.400]  just a moment it is Thursday the fourth day of February 2010 we're going to be
[01:08.400 --> 01:14.400]  live here for the next four hours read Beckman an icon in the Patriot Liberty
[01:14.400 --> 01:19.320]  Movement against the private Federal Reserve someone who co-authored the law
[01:19.320 --> 01:24.640]  that never was exposing the private run-for-profit Federal Reserves
[01:24.640 --> 01:29.720]  collection agency the IRS will be joining us in the next hour and I've
[01:29.720 --> 01:36.000]  been intended to get him back on for a few weeks I'd also been working on
[01:36.000 --> 01:41.400]  getting Eustace Mullins back on but I knew that he'd been sick and then better
[01:41.400 --> 01:46.160]  and then he'd do interviews and then he went on a speaking tour over the weekend
[01:46.160 --> 01:54.600]  and had a stroke and was taken back to Texas and died on Tuesday so we've
[01:54.600 --> 02:02.360]  posted some of my interviews with Eustace Mullins up on info wars.com a real
[02:02.360 --> 02:06.840]  trailblazer when it came to exposing the true architecture of the government the
[02:06.840 --> 02:13.280]  private run-for-profit Federal Reserve. I interviewed him many times and will
[02:13.280 --> 02:20.920]  certainly miss his passing knowing now that he's in a better place but certainly
[02:20.920 --> 02:25.480]  a controversial figure but a real trailblazer when it came to exposing the
[02:25.480 --> 02:32.200]  private run-for-profit shadow government we have another icon of resistance red
[02:32.200 --> 02:39.600]  Beckman coming up in the next hour we're gonna have wide open phones for the
[02:39.600 --> 02:42.880]  balance of the radio broadcast I've got a researcher coming on the last 30
[02:42.880 --> 02:47.440]  minutes to deal with the aftermath of Agent Orange and how that ties into the
[02:47.440 --> 02:54.440]  current activities of Monsanto with their genetically modified crops they
[02:54.440 --> 03:01.320]  brought you aspartame it seems like they only bring you things that are evil so
[03:01.320 --> 03:11.160]  we're gonna be breaking that down as well today but when I saw this story today
[03:11.160 --> 03:25.920]  out of the Arizona Republic newspaper I was really taken aback and I already
[03:25.920 --> 03:33.040]  consciously knew this but to see it manifest this fast
[03:34.480 --> 03:41.400]  blew my mind and so our top story today I'm gonna run through some of the
[03:41.400 --> 03:47.880]  stories I've got here but the first but then I'm gonna detail this Phoenix gives
[03:47.880 --> 04:05.240]  okay to 2% tax on food baby food milk meat vegetables rice water anything you
[04:05.240 --> 04:10.840]  consume the Romans at the height of their tyranny would not put taxes on food in
[04:10.840 --> 04:21.880]  fact subsidize it to the poor no one ever in history taxes food it is the big
[04:21.880 --> 04:32.160]  no no it hits the poor the worst but this is your government America and I went
[04:32.160 --> 04:34.960]  and did some research and found out a bunch of other cities and states are
[04:34.960 --> 04:44.200]  saying yeah we're gonna tax your food we've got to pay the bankers everything I
[04:44.200 --> 04:48.640]  mean we really are pathetic putting up with us because God forbid they get rid
[04:48.640 --> 04:51.880]  of any of the government bureaucrats they're hiring and of course their pay
[04:51.880 --> 04:56.080]  is all going up on average they're literally gonna take the food out of our
[04:56.080 --> 05:01.520]  mouths but they're fat bloated bellies this is Alex Jones with five good
[05:01.520 --> 05:05.520]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new
[05:05.520 --> 05:09.320]  climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[05:09.320 --> 05:13.400]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[05:13.400 --> 05:17.640]  allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the
[05:17.640 --> 05:21.920]  name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[05:21.920 --> 05:25.880]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[05:25.880 --> 05:30.240]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is
[05:30.240 --> 05:34.000]  always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[05:34.000 --> 05:38.160]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[05:38.160 --> 05:41.960]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar
[05:41.960 --> 05:45.440]  power generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors

[11:59.440 --> 12:04.680]  identified as kite server killed by sharks off Stuart Beach I guess we
[12:04.680 --> 12:09.000]  better have a five-day waiting period on swimming land because if one person
[12:09.000 --> 12:16.200]  could die we've got a bandit you know we have if if there's 152 deaths in 2008

[12:20.760 --> 12:26.160]  million people why not arrest anybody that raises their voice or if it'll save
[12:26.160 --> 12:30.320]  one child why not just in the family have the government raise all the
[12:30.320 --> 12:35.040]  children then it doesn't matter though when they hurt the children
[12:36.240 --> 12:45.440]  Eustace Mullins passes on probably deserves more credit than anybody else
[12:45.440 --> 12:51.480]  for really exposing the private fellow reserve system Myron Fagan as well I
[12:51.480 --> 12:56.960]  guess those two men now part of history but their work will continue on five
[12:56.960 --> 12:59.600]  time later I'm going to play a few clips from interviews I've had with Eustace
[12:59.600 --> 13:03.400]  Mullins we have another icon of exposing the new world order and the private
[13:03.400 --> 13:16.320]  banking system red Beckman joining us coming up in the next hour today Senate
[13:16.320 --> 13:21.760]  passes APAC sponsored Iran sanctions act which is really an act of war against
[13:21.760 --> 13:28.400]  Iran as they heat that up justice defends ruling on finance Clarence Thomas on
[13:28.400 --> 13:32.120]  Tuesday vigorously defended the Supreme Court's recent campaign finance
[13:32.120 --> 13:37.520]  decision that even foreign corporations can give unlimited amounts of money you
[13:37.520 --> 13:41.400]  know I would have agreed if the court would have said you can't ban a film
[13:41.400 --> 13:46.400]  criticizing Hillary Clinton that's the case they heard but they found in the
[13:46.400 --> 13:49.640]  case that corporations including foreign corporations to do whatever they
[13:49.640 --> 13:54.280]  want but the way I read the ruling and that was now a week and a half ago the
[13:54.280 --> 13:59.160]  media is now confirming my analysis that it still restricts down to three
[13:59.160 --> 14:04.400]  thousand dollars what individuals can give how do you like that foreign
[14:04.400 --> 14:10.720]  corporations can give whatever they want but you a citizen can't you're just a
[14:10.720 --> 14:16.520]  milk cow a prison planet article US Treasury official openly serves on

[14:41.680 --> 14:50.320]  programs that is coming up also MSNBC says Tea Party aims to harness steam at
[14:50.320 --> 14:55.120]  convention Sarah Palin is keynote speaker for event plagued by controversy
[14:55.120 --> 15:00.000]  and infighting well it's plagued by controversy and infighting because
[15:00.000 --> 15:05.560]  you're going to have co until pro in there but more importantly you've got
[15:05.560 --> 15:10.240]  Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin who've basically taken over the Tea Party
[15:10.240 --> 15:16.560]  movement created by the Ron Paul revolution who were anti-war anti-
[15:16.560 --> 15:21.520]  corporate welfare anti-big government ladies and gentlemen all you need to
[15:21.520 --> 15:28.200]  know about Sarah Palin is that she was picked by John McCain that's all you
[15:28.200 --> 15:31.800]  need to know about her and you'll find out down the road those of you that are
[15:31.800 --> 15:35.800]  snookered and those of you that have been bamboozled and con by it just like
[15:35.800 --> 15:39.520]  people that supported Obama you're going you've now found out most of you
[15:39.520 --> 15:45.800]  still a few of you are idiotically drinking the Kool-Aid so we'll be
[15:45.800 --> 15:52.320]  breaking that down as well also stocks tumble on worries about labor market
[15:52.320 --> 15:57.120]  we're going to be going over what's really happening as initial findings for
[15:57.120 --> 16:05.800]  jobless claims rise investors brace for monthly jobs report it is all coming up
[16:05.800 --> 16:11.600]  today and then I have a story here out of the mail newspaper says child care
[16:11.600 --> 16:16.840]  Chinese style Rick Shaw driver changed two-year-old son to post while he's at
[16:16.840 --> 16:23.160]  work and the government has no problem with it millions of Chinese chain their
[16:23.160 --> 16:32.080]  children or tie them to lamp post or to trees for their daycare and then they
[16:32.080 --> 16:38.840]  simply use the bathroom on the street now how are we going to compete with
[16:38.840 --> 16:44.760]  China with no environmental standards no carbon taxes no regulations toxic ways
[16:44.760 --> 16:50.760]  is dumped directly into the rivers their coal plants don't have scrubbers on them
[16:50.760 --> 16:57.720]  nothing well that how they deal with it is shut down our power plants that are
[16:57.720 --> 17:04.000]  clean almost completely clean with much of the new technology and then move it
[17:04.000 --> 17:09.360]  all to China with unlimited pollution and then if a parent is seen yelling at
[17:09.360 --> 17:14.000]  their child CPS tries to take them in England I remember a parliament on a
[17:14.000 --> 17:22.200]  few days ago out of 1,000 children taken in court for every thousand cases
[17:22.200 --> 17:35.720]  997 are taken three out of a thousand times the secretive kangaroo court rules
[17:35.720 --> 17:38.320]  that you get to keep your children so you got three chances out of a thousand
[17:38.320 --> 17:42.800]  and it's pretty similar to that here in the US and in many other cases if the
[17:42.800 --> 17:47.280]  husband yells at the woman or she yells at him that everybody's been trained to
[17:47.280 --> 17:50.880]  then call the police even for yelling and then they come and even if you get a
[17:50.880 --> 17:54.680]  divorce from the evil husband that yelled or whatever then you still can't
[17:54.680 --> 17:57.440]  have your children the women are finding out real fast so now the government
[17:57.440 --> 18:02.160]  wants to put and is putting cameras in all the new parents homes guilty until
[18:02.160 --> 18:07.200]  proven innocent so so in China you just change your kid to the side of the highway
[18:07.200 --> 18:12.440]  and the government says yes that's the that's that's the child care in China
[18:12.440 --> 18:17.400]  we've got to out compete everybody and then our government says if you yell at
[18:17.400 --> 18:21.680]  your kid we're going to take him even though there's no law and no wonder all
[18:21.680 --> 18:26.000]  the factories are shutting down you're losing your jobs but don't worry you're
[18:26.000 --> 18:29.880]  losing your jobs record joblessness states going bankrupt left and right
[18:29.880 --> 18:37.920]  officially bankrupt and that doesn't matter because all over the country cities
[18:37.920 --> 18:43.240]  and counties and states are putting taxes on food first it was just going to be
[18:43.240 --> 18:48.720]  fattening food and soft drinks now it's everything and see that's what England's
[18:48.720 --> 18:52.080]  proposing in fact they're already putting in many areas of Europe a tax on
[18:52.080 --> 18:57.880]  every can of corn every can of beans every head of lettuce every steak every
[18:57.880 --> 19:01.960]  chicken everything taxes carbon taxes
[19:01.960 --> 19:08.160]  Austin's proposing carbon taxes on bottled water on meat San Francisco's
[19:08.160 --> 19:15.240]  already put it in they don't want you wealthy they don't want you middle class
[19:15.240 --> 19:19.200]  they don't even want you poor they're going to bankrupt you and then the

[24:06.000 --> 24:11.200]  since I mentioned at the start of the radio broadcast that the mega city of
[24:11.200 --> 24:17.400]  Phoenix is going to start taxing food at 2% then of course jack it up they're
[24:17.400 --> 24:23.120]  already talking about that the income tax started at 1% and now is going up to
[24:23.120 --> 24:29.000]  40 and then I've got these Twitter comments coming in saying food has
[24:29.000 --> 24:34.000]  always been taxed in Chicago area usually at a lower rate than other goods
[24:34.000 --> 24:39.400]  but we've always been taxed well see there you go throughout history you
[24:39.400 --> 24:45.280]  never tax food that hits the poorest but they're gonna tax your food and they're
[24:45.280 --> 24:50.640]  gonna do it for environmental reasons oh yes it's for the earth humans eating
[24:50.640 --> 24:59.200]  food is bad desperate to save police fire and other city jobs that's an old
[24:59.200 --> 25:04.560]  trick cities always don't buy new radios or ambulances until I won't fill the
[25:04.560 --> 25:08.280]  potholes until they've paid the bankers all their money and given themselves
[25:08.280 --> 25:12.560]  pay raises and I've seen the statistics in the last year government pay rates go
[25:12.560 --> 25:17.040]  up and up and up the government sector is growing growing growing the private
[25:17.040 --> 25:21.160]  sector shrinking shrinking shrinking and the government sector is arming arming
[25:21.160 --> 25:28.320]  arming and surveilling surveilling and spying on their slaves it's slavery you
[25:28.320 --> 25:33.480]  don't own your property you pay property taxes and that's going up and up and up
[25:33.480 --> 25:39.520]  Phoenix gives okay to 2% tax on food desperate to save police fire and other
[25:39.520 --> 25:45.280]  city jobs a divided Phoenix City Council on Tuesday approved a sales tax on
[25:45.280 --> 25:50.000]  grocery items that will generate tens of millions of dollars a year the 2%
[25:50.000 --> 25:54.760]  food tax will take effect April 1st off for the April fools and a little joke on
[25:54.760 --> 26:01.920]  the slaves a tax on milk meat vegetables and other food purchase by
[26:01.920 --> 26:06.400]  shoppers will generate an estimated 12.5 million for the fiscal year that ends
[26:06.400 --> 26:12.080]  June 30th it will raise another 50 million for fiscal year 2011 food
[26:12.080 --> 26:18.080]  purchases with food stamps will not be taxed so they will tax everybody else
[26:18.080 --> 26:22.160]  and then you'll be so bankrupt you go get food stamps from them then you get
[26:22.160 --> 26:26.480]  CPS visits and they get to take your children the extra tax revenue means
[26:26.480 --> 26:32.120]  Phoenix will have more money and its coffers to help close the 241 million
[26:32.120 --> 26:42.880]  general fund budget deficit through June 2011 and Craig just brought me all of
[26:42.880 --> 26:54.920]  the different cities and states that tax food my gosh it is going in
[26:54.920 --> 27:01.640]  everywhere it says Arkansas taxes food Georgia taxes food Illinois taxes food
[27:01.640 --> 27:10.320]  Missouri taxes food North Carolina taxes food this is from tax admin dot
[27:10.320 --> 27:19.600]  org Utah taxes food Tennessee taxes food Virginia taxes food the list goes on
[27:19.600 --> 27:23.920]  and on I didn't even know this I guess you learn something every day huh West
[27:23.920 --> 27:29.800]  Virginia notice all the poorest states are doing it I didn't know Wyoming taxed
[27:29.800 --> 27:31.800]  it
[27:37.680 --> 27:44.760]  oh wait this has an asterix by those states so most the states are exempt the
[27:44.760 --> 27:51.880]  point is they are raising taxes on every front and they don't care if you're
[27:51.880 --> 27:55.760]  losing your job they don't care of your insurances out you're going to jail for
[27:55.760 --> 28:00.760]  it but if you're an illegal alien you're above the law 800 plus cities or
[28:00.760 --> 28:06.080]  sanctuary cities where I live people say oh don't be mean to the immigrants but
[28:06.080 --> 28:17.280]  I as a citizen will be given a ticket or arrested the police admit it I saw
[28:17.280 --> 28:21.360]  associated press articles where when ice arrest illegal aliens they take them to
[28:21.360 --> 28:25.320]  government job fairs and give most of them government jobs and green cards I
[28:25.320 --> 28:30.280]  mean this is a joke and I've noticed this for a long time but now we're seeing
[28:30.280 --> 28:34.920]  bona fide massive evidence that is coordinated it isn't just we have
[28:34.920 --> 28:41.560]  foreigners like Schwarzenegger ruling over us in California but the police
[28:41.560 --> 28:47.880]  departments are recruiting immigrants they are recruiting foreigners to be
[28:47.880 --> 28:52.760]  CPS workers and it's the same in Europe and England we are a country ruled by
[28:52.760 --> 28:58.440]  foreigners ruled by criminals ruled by parasitic foreign banks and they're
[28:58.440 --> 29:02.400]  just bringing in foreign mercs I remember 10 years ago getting on air and
[29:02.400 --> 29:07.240]  reading mainstream news articles where the military was hiring illegal aliens
[29:07.240 --> 29:10.520]  and now felons and people can't even believe it and I have associated press
[29:10.520 --> 29:15.200]  articles as well where city police departments are hiring illegal aliens
[29:15.200 --> 29:20.640]  because they will do what they're told they have no history of freedom they
[29:20.640 --> 29:27.760]  come from corrupt countries they had NLE09 last year were troops from 14
[29:27.760 --> 29:31.640]  countries practice quote taking on American terrorists major police
[29:31.640 --> 29:34.400]  departments under FEMA grants and Homeland Security are taking over the
[29:34.400 --> 29:38.400]  Boy Scouts and openly training them to quote take on disgruntled vets we have
[29:38.400 --> 29:42.560]  the Homeland Security Mike reports America better wake up to just how bad
[29:42.560 --> 29:47.880]  it is in Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin and Barack Obama aren't going to tell you

[31:15.360 --> 31:20.400]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[31:20.400 --> 31:25.800]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[31:25.800 --> 31:30.720]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[31:30.720 --> 31:35.080]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world

[31:42.800 --> 31:48.320]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of

[32:01.040 --> 32:04.920]  gardeners this is an urgent GCN self-reliance update GCN has just
[32:04.920 --> 32:08.720]  discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants flowers and herbs it's
[32:08.720 --> 32:12.040]  called proto grow and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it
[32:12.040 --> 32:15.880]  seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and
[32:15.880 --> 32:19.000]  like conditions now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for
[32:19.000 --> 32:23.120]  self-reliance proto grows unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral
[32:23.120 --> 32:26.680]  uptake and dramatically increases bloom set creating maximum plant growth in
[32:26.680 --> 32:29.920]  minimum time proto grow works by providing geometric keys which have the
[32:29.920 --> 32:33.200]  capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants
[32:33.200 --> 32:36.200]  proto grows full spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with
[32:36.200 --> 32:39.720]  extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value and if you want to
[32:39.720 --> 32:43.320]  double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass you can if you want to grow
[32:43.320 --> 32:47.280]  nutritionalized superfoods with non hybrids it's now easy GCN listeners who

[32:53.080 --> 33:11.200]  crazy dot com or call 877-327-0365 that's 877-327-0365
[33:23.080 --> 33:36.960]  again and again coming straight on for the tirents
[33:38.520 --> 33:43.400]  all right I'm gonna open the phones up right now
[33:45.920 --> 33:52.420]  for listeners that want to specifically talk about food taxes and states like
[33:52.420 --> 33:56.920]  California and Pennsylvania effectively bankrupt but don't worry the banks
[33:56.920 --> 34:01.240]  alone the states more of our own money to then pay it back as interest to the
[34:01.240 --> 34:10.960]  banks they get it coming and going 1-800-259-9231
[34:10.960 --> 34:26.460]  here's some of the other news I have notice as the taxes all go up the
[34:26.460 --> 34:31.120]  supposed services all get cut because most the money now goes to the bankers
[34:31.120 --> 34:37.600]  and interest just like Nigeria or Brazil or Argentina we have been enslaved
[34:37.600 --> 34:43.660]  through fraud by the Ponzi scheme and don't try to say no to the fraud because
[34:43.660 --> 34:48.100]  the paramilitary police and military have now been forged into a weapon to
[34:48.100 --> 34:52.780]  carry out the fraud and enforce the fraud but they are beginning to wake up
[34:52.780 --> 35:01.420]  here's another story out of the news of AZ central dot com out of the Arizona
[35:01.420 --> 35:07.700]  Republic president proposes cutting border patrol oh yes going to cut that
[35:07.700 --> 35:11.640]  yes spent more money than all presidents before him combined back to
[35:11.640 --> 35:17.100]  George Washington but he will cut that border patrol president Barack Obama's
[35:17.100 --> 35:22.000]  proposed 2011 budget would cut the border patrol by 180 agents they already
[35:22.000 --> 35:24.740]  don't want to do their job and have a pickup garbage on the side of the road
[35:24.740 --> 35:29.260]  and trim spending on a virtual fence along the nation southwest border which
[35:29.260 --> 35:33.180]  they never even built but small parts of homeland securities officials confirm
[35:33.180 --> 35:36.660]  the proposed cuts money during a budget briefing for reporters they said no
[35:36.660 --> 35:39.860]  border agents would lose their jobs instead the positions would be cut
[35:39.860 --> 35:46.580]  through attrition oh yes as the agents retire and then here's another eugenics
[35:46.580 --> 35:51.340]  article from RT journalists calls for euthanasia of disabled newborns and
[35:51.340 --> 35:55.700]  then already in England if you have a learning disability they don't let you
[35:55.700 --> 35:59.580]  have children or they take them well now they'll just kill you because they're
[35:59.580 --> 36:05.740]  loving the government's nice the article titled finish it off so it doesn't
[36:05.740 --> 36:11.300]  suffer it you notice all these people that want to kill humans always though
[36:11.300 --> 36:15.580]  we're animal rights activists they do that so you they can take your human
[36:15.580 --> 36:19.700]  capacity to care for other humans that have empathy and they place it on the
[36:19.700 --> 36:26.840]  animals it's all psych warfare the article titled finish it off so it
[36:26.840 --> 36:30.940]  doesn't suffer which calls for the euthanasia of disabled newborn children
[36:30.940 --> 36:37.140]  has caused public outrage in Russia and has led to fierce debates in the blogging
[36:37.140 --> 36:41.020]  community and the article under question the author says that the killing of the
[36:41.020 --> 36:45.980]  newborn is in fact the same as abortion or super late-term abortion well that's
[36:45.980 --> 36:50.960]  what Obama has said that's what Peter Singer says at Princeton and calls
[36:50.960 --> 36:58.220]  disabled newborns defective blanks and newborn idiots he states that depriving
[36:58.220 --> 37:04.260]  disabled infants of life is true humanism the Union of Russian journalists
[37:04.260 --> 37:08.420]  is accused the author of the article it's a scientific article of breaching
[37:08.420 --> 37:12.380]  professional ethics the Union board criticism comes from the fact that
[37:12.380 --> 37:16.420]  instead of discussing the right for free choice of disabled newborns fate the
[37:16.420 --> 37:20.300]  author claims the only rational way is to deprive them of life then of course
[37:20.300 --> 37:23.740]  I'll have to be pre-screening to make sure mommy's not gonna have one and
[37:23.740 --> 37:27.940]  forced abortion as China proposed a Copenhagen two months ago the board
[37:27.940 --> 37:37.180]  concluded the articles in trenches upon extremism the author is not raising a
[37:37.180 --> 37:41.060]  disabled child that is why he generalized conclusions about the life of
[37:41.060 --> 37:44.860]  disabled people and their families
[37:47.860 --> 37:57.220]  and it goes on from there now that's the type of news I have here in front of
[37:57.220 --> 38:01.660]  me and notice when government commits crimes against humanity or uses DU
[38:01.660 --> 38:06.380]  killing our own soldiers and maiming and hurting others it's okay and let's not
[38:06.380 --> 38:12.380]  talk about it but oh did a parent yell at their child we've got to take them
[38:12.380 --> 38:21.180]  we're the government we want to take care of everybody we're going to go to
[38:21.180 --> 38:28.820]  your phone calls right now red Beckman is coming up to talk about tax time in a
[38:28.820 --> 38:33.700]  month and a half that we're accelerating towards and who you really pay your taxes
[38:33.700 --> 38:40.300]  to and his take on the state of the Union David Canada you're on the air yeah
[38:40.300 --> 38:47.020]  let's hey buddy I am just calling about two things well the the Olympics are
[38:47.020 --> 38:52.100]  coming up and the criminalized sales tax that could be implemented Ontario and
[38:52.100 --> 38:56.620]  Canada here wondering what you think about the the risk of terrorism and that
[38:56.620 --> 39:04.140]  the Olympic and Vancouver there well I know that the White House has had its
[39:04.140 --> 39:08.100]  minions go speak before Congress and they all went down the line in fact I
[39:08.100 --> 39:12.620]  want to play that clip later in the show and said we will be hit by terrorists
[39:12.620 --> 39:15.780]  there they're going to try to attack it's a certainty in the next three to six
[39:15.780 --> 39:20.740]  months but don't worry they'll take all our rights and keep us safe from it and
[39:20.740 --> 39:24.540]  all these other pundits saying they need a terror attack to get their new war
[39:24.540 --> 39:29.340]  with Iran going so if you look at the political landscape I think we're now
[39:29.340 --> 39:34.260]  entering the maximum danger period of stage terror attacks and you couple that
[39:34.260 --> 39:39.860]  with the underwear Christmas Day villain and that's clearly was staged I mean
[39:39.860 --> 39:44.420]  that's now in plain view admitted but hasn't become a large news story
[39:44.420 --> 39:48.900]  yeah definitely now now tell me about taxes on food do you have that up in
[39:48.900 --> 39:54.740]  Canada well we're we're going to be having a new tax coming up July 1st the
[39:54.740 --> 39:58.740]  harmonized sales tax are going to be combining yes basically a new tax on
[39:58.740 --> 40:01.820]  food and tax and everything but the harmonized sales tax are going to be
[40:01.820 --> 40:07.580]  combining the the provincial sales tax with the government sales tax so things
[40:07.580 --> 40:12.540]  that were previously only subject to government sales tax or the provincial
[40:12.540 --> 40:17.700]  sales tax are going to be combining both of them doubling everything doubling the
[40:17.700 --> 40:22.460]  goodie looting well basically and then it all goes under central control yeah all
[40:22.460 --> 40:27.700]  over the world they're just passing taxes on food taxes on water taxes on
[40:27.700 --> 40:32.700]  energy and they're not going to stop they're going to squeeze and squeeze and
[40:32.700 --> 40:36.860]  drive you into the arms of your loving government your euthanasia government
[40:36.860 --> 40:41.180]  thank you Dave because there's too many of us and we're living too well I can't
[40:41.180 --> 40:46.020]  tell you how many times I've heard MPR I don't listen maybe once a week scores of
[40:46.020 --> 40:49.820]  times I've heard them say it's good our economy's falling apart we've all seen
[40:49.820 --> 40:54.380]  the headlines it's good for our carbon footprint we've had it too well we're
[40:54.380 --> 41:01.260]  gonna learn the government's gonna learn us our authorities our officials
[41:01.260 --> 41:08.140]  Briggs in Illinois you're on the air hey Alex and crew this is Captain Briggs
[41:08.140 --> 41:12.140]  with a home in Colleen Texas right now I'm calling for my wife's house in Rockford
[41:12.140 --> 41:19.540]  Illinois okay a couple of quick points 30 year veteran mostly special ops I got
[41:19.540 --> 41:26.020]  your back me and some other Patriots I'll be driving from Illinois back to
[41:26.020 --> 41:31.180]  Texas in time to vote for Deborah Medina for Texas governor I'll be there to
[41:31.180 --> 41:36.340]  hopefully support you and y'all at the Austin gun show and three the little
[41:36.340 --> 41:41.540]  recon between here in Illinois and back to Texas to see just what's going on as
[41:41.540 --> 41:46.380]  we continue our downward spiral and hopefully head back towards liberty and
[41:46.380 --> 41:51.380]  freedom when you talk to your military buddies who were in or out of the
[41:51.380 --> 41:56.340]  military are they really starting to wake up well let's say I've got with 30
[41:56.340 --> 42:00.780]  years in and I've been all around the globe unfortunately in certain
[42:00.780 --> 42:03.980]  circumstances I can't discuss them here I've been an operator if you know what
[42:03.980 --> 42:11.180]  I mean so some of the stuff that y'all are talking about in the open media now
[42:11.180 --> 42:19.060]  I I'm part and parcel to and it all comes back to credibility the buddies
[42:19.060 --> 42:22.260]  that I've been talking to and I've also reached out some law enforcement
[42:22.260 --> 42:28.020]  officials as well law enforcement agencies personnel they understand they
[42:28.020 --> 42:32.860]  got a buddy they're awake they're just standing by fighting their time so what
[42:32.860 --> 42:37.340]  I would say to the people out there you know John through public is read your
[42:37.340 --> 42:44.300]  Constitution review your bill of rights stand ready it's coming I do know that
[42:44.300 --> 42:50.700]  we've seen the national polls of 98% of policing they're a hundred percent pro
[42:50.700 --> 42:56.900]  second amendment and I do know that the military is on fire with awakening to
[42:56.900 --> 43:02.780]  the New World Order but here's the problem they are replacing good police
[43:02.780 --> 43:08.260]  and military with foreigners and criminals as fast as they can and and
[43:08.260 --> 43:12.220]  admittedly they've even had MSNBC specials about all the gangbangers they're
[43:12.220 --> 43:16.180]  hiring I mean does the military ever talk about that that they're trying to
[43:16.180 --> 43:22.260]  to like bring in a gang of pirates to enforce for them well I have first-hand
[43:22.260 --> 43:27.100]  knowledge of five seen entire companies of guys sport and gang gang bang and
[43:27.100 --> 43:30.780]  tattoos and whatnot we had whole companies in Iraq from the company
[43:30.780 --> 43:33.540]  commander in the first sergeant all the way down they were made of
[43:33.540 --> 43:37.260]  specifically certain gambit gangbangers so yes they have created these pockets
[43:37.260 --> 43:42.060]  of their you know their thugs however I would submit you there are enough
[43:42.060 --> 43:44.940]  patriots out there there are enough veterans out there and we know how to
[43:44.940 --> 43:49.220]  shoot I grew up on a farm so you know I know how to shoot that'll take care of
[43:49.220 --> 43:55.020]  those thugs and the people just need to remember you know of getting back to the
[43:55.020 --> 44:00.260]  basics the one thing that scares me and I'm an anti-terrorism officer I've
[44:00.260 --> 44:03.620]  spent a lot of time in the special ops community the one thing that you've
[44:03.620 --> 44:08.260]  touched on here in the last couple of weeks is the Olympics and our next
[44:08.260 --> 44:13.180]  false flag and just like I was fitting that Fort Hood Texas on the 11th of
[44:13.180 --> 44:19.940]  September 2001 in a chemical unit and I saw those twin towers that I said here
[44:19.940 --> 44:26.580]  we go it started it so you were like you were like even back then sir I'm like
[44:26.580 --> 44:32.820]  you and I have watched your your interview with Dean Haglin you know I've
[44:32.820 --> 44:36.420]  been awake for a long time but I've had to be quiet and just observe take notes
[44:36.420 --> 44:43.820]  and and seek out other like-minded liberty oriented folks so when the time
[44:43.820 --> 44:47.460]  comes we know who's on our left we know who's on our right we know he's behind
[44:47.460 --> 44:51.300]  us and in front of us and above us and below us so we can protect we need to
[44:51.300 --> 44:55.540]  protect our families for our children so I've been awake for a long time I've
[44:55.540 --> 45:01.100]  gone into certain organizations just so I could get a look to the recon and maybe
[45:01.100 --> 45:03.540]  gain some credibility when somebody says well what do you know about the
[45:03.540 --> 45:07.860]  Freemasons I am one what do you know about school teachers I am one what do
[45:07.860 --> 45:11.860]  you know about combat veterans I am one what do you know about farm folks I am
[45:11.860 --> 45:17.780]  one so you know I say to those to you and your staff there your crew there of
[45:17.780 --> 45:21.140]  getting the word out and trying to wake people up and I just want to share with
[45:21.140 --> 45:25.540]  your brother that everywhere I go and when you see a white man walking around
[45:25.540 --> 45:31.660]  the cowboy hat in a coat wearing a Obama Joker or a join or die in Info Wars
[45:31.660 --> 45:36.700]  t-shirt you got some people turning their heads here and I make it a point to
[45:36.700 --> 45:41.420]  mention infowars.com or prisonplanetv.com or Alex Jones's name at least
[45:41.420 --> 45:46.820]  minimum 12 times a day well God bless you Braggs Braggs I appreciate your call
[45:46.820 --> 45:52.460]  and look forward to meet you sometime take care we are reaching millions of
[45:52.460 --> 45:56.140]  new people a month and it does have a system very very concerned but we're
[45:56.140 --> 46:01.580]  only one operation against the New World Order it is you out there the
[46:01.580 --> 46:06.660]  listeners you are the very front line of this fight remember that and every
[46:06.660 --> 46:10.500]  little thing you do whether it's telling somebody about info wars.com or the
[46:10.500 --> 46:15.100]  podcast or give him a copy of a DVD or getting your neighbors together and
[46:15.100 --> 46:19.460]  going to city council and speaking out against new taxes everything you do
[46:19.460 --> 46:23.980]  brings this new world order closer to its downfall because it's so outrageously
[46:23.980 --> 46:30.340]  criminal it's so outrageously corrupt it's so ridiculously fraudulent that all
[46:30.340 --> 46:35.060]  we've got to do is point it out and stand up against it let's talk to let's
[46:35.060 --> 46:37.700]  try to hurry through the calls here let's talk to Eddie in Wisconsin Eddie
[46:37.700 --> 46:43.660]  thanks for holding hi it's Edie Edie I'm sorry Edie that's okay I'm gonna get my
[46:43.660 --> 46:47.620]  computer screen closer it's about 10 feet away and I said I tend to read it
[46:47.620 --> 46:52.500]  wrong go ahead that's okay one thing I guess I've been thinking about when you
[46:52.500 --> 46:56.980]  mentioned about the peaceful revolution that's that I look toward I've been
[46:56.980 --> 47:02.500]  really encouraged by the Tea Party people and I was so glad you brought up
[47:02.500 --> 47:07.020]  about Deborah Medina because I think she's an excellent example of the kind of
[47:07.020 --> 47:12.420]  person that should be running for office and what I'm encouraged by is the
[47:12.420 --> 47:18.180]  number of people who want to run for local office run for governor I have a
[47:18.180 --> 47:25.060]  friend who has a cousin who's running for governor of South Dakota who is you
[47:25.060 --> 47:30.580]  know independent and not bought out by anybody so these are things that
[47:30.580 --> 47:37.180]  encourage me and that's what I'm praying for I get a little concerned about the
[47:37.180 --> 47:42.140]  people that are looking for a war because because I don't think we need that
[47:42.140 --> 47:47.140]  we need if we're gonna have the good people to be there it's the middle class
[47:47.140 --> 47:51.500]  good people that need to be in office well we have to remember the system
[47:51.500 --> 47:56.620]  continues to stage violent attacks against innocent groups so that they
[47:56.620 --> 48:02.180]  can have the pretext to enslave everybody and set up a control grid at the
[48:02.180 --> 48:06.660]  same time the fact that we are an armed population is one of the final big
[48:06.660 --> 48:12.100]  deterrence to accelerated tyranny but they're still moving forward and people
[48:12.100 --> 48:17.500]  have a right to defend themselves but but but absolutely it is the it is the
[48:17.500 --> 48:22.460]  establishment that seeks to provocateur people into violence EDI I
[48:22.460 --> 48:28.500]  appreciate your call Scott in Arizona you're on the air go hey there Alex how
[48:28.500 --> 48:34.180]  you doing hey Scott go ahead hey just want to say about a hundred away from
[48:34.180 --> 48:40.740]  the thousand mark on the DVDs and glad to hear you got Brett Beckman on I want
[48:40.740 --> 48:45.360]  to know are you familiar with Peter excuse me Peter Eric Hendricks
[48:45.360 --> 48:51.860]  Kipendrickson lost horizons calm wrote the book cracking the code dealing with
[48:51.860 --> 48:57.900]  the income taxes yeah I don't you know I don't know about that cracking the code
[48:57.900 --> 49:02.740]  information I mean I don't think there's any code where you show it's a fraud and
[49:02.740 --> 49:07.940]  then don't pay it it's a criminal mafia we got it in 1913 the income tax wasn't
[49:07.940 --> 49:14.180]  widely distributed until the mid 50s and it is a fraud but they enforce it
[49:14.180 --> 49:19.340]  criminally just like there's no law against the Austin gun show but the
[49:19.340 --> 49:22.820]  police shut it down and then lied and said that they didn't shut it down and
[49:22.820 --> 49:27.380]  now admit they did shut it down with a nuisance abatement which is a fraud but
[49:27.380 --> 49:33.580]  yeah I mean I mean I am familiar with some of that and there's a lot of
[49:33.580 --> 49:39.860]  patriot mythology out there that gets people in a lot of trouble the fact is
[49:39.860 --> 49:46.540]  they talk about red Beckman the income tax was never properly ratified so that
[49:46.540 --> 49:50.580]  so it is illegal it is a fraud and so a lot of the stuff in cracking the code
[49:50.580 --> 49:53.940]  is real and and yes that the corporations have made it where they're all
[49:53.940 --> 49:59.060]  exempt from the laws they give us but they but but still a lot of people think
[49:59.060 --> 50:02.340]  well then if it's not the law and it's a fraud I'm not going to pay it they
[50:02.340 --> 50:06.820]  don't care I mean the IRS just bought a whole bunch of more weapons that's in
[50:06.820 --> 50:14.420]  the news to go out and force on people I mean they they arrested Joe Bannister
[50:14.420 --> 50:19.420]  who was an armed Treasury agent and he was paying taxes all he did was find out
[50:19.420 --> 50:22.820]  it was all a fraud and start giving speeches and they arrested him and he
[50:22.820 --> 50:28.300]  beat him in federal court but barely you know thank God he had a jury you don't
[50:28.300 --> 50:31.700]  get that with the family court which is why that those are totally illegitimate
[50:31.700 --> 50:36.620]  but anything else actually I'd like to give you Peter Eric Kendrickson's phone
[50:36.620 --> 50:40.820]  number if I could up there I'd like to ask that you have him on so that he can

[52:13.980 --> 52:19.580]  tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling
[52:19.580 --> 52:24.860]  the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[52:24.860 --> 52:29.380]  attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal

[56:04.380 --> 56:10.620]  calls here let's talk to Ken in Michigan Ken you're on the air Alex
[56:10.620 --> 56:18.980]  welcome how you doing you're a great American hero and you know I'm really
[56:18.980 --> 56:25.620]  appreciate what you do spreading the word that's right one of the things I
[56:25.620 --> 56:34.700]  wanted to bring up is I live here near Detroit Michigan and there's areas that
[56:34.700 --> 56:42.540]  are just completely illegal aliens now and it really bothers me because it's
[56:42.540 --> 56:49.660]  like a war zone down here and all you see is Mexicans driving around in
[56:49.660 --> 56:58.220]  Cadillacs and and I just don't know where the money's coming from it's called
[56:58.220 --> 57:05.260]  consulate matricula and now Poland Venezuela and others are setting up
[57:05.260 --> 57:11.580]  embassies and missions as they call them in the US to issue them because Mexico
[57:11.580 --> 57:17.940]  for more than a decade goes in and lobbies local cities and states to not
[57:17.940 --> 57:24.820]  follow law and to accept consulate matricula then they will give a hundred
[57:24.820 --> 57:31.060]  two hundred three hundred I mean they don't care fake IDs to one illegal
[57:31.060 --> 57:36.740]  alien inside the US then Wells Fargo Bank of America they will then give you a
[57:36.740 --> 57:43.940]  bank account with that they get everything and citizens regardless of what
[57:43.940 --> 57:49.020]  color you are you get nothing and I mean I've got an employee here who worked at
[57:49.020 --> 57:52.180]  Austin Energy and customer service and they had big meetings about it old
[57:52.180 --> 57:56.020]  ladies ten dollars over turn their power off turn their gas off the
[57:56.020 --> 58:00.300]  illegals though in the same house for four or five years no one pays but once
[58:00.300 --> 58:05.660]  every six months they turn their power off a new matricula comes up they pay
[58:05.660 --> 58:10.940]  the 250 they say oh someone else lives here now to get it turned on so I mean
[58:10.940 --> 58:14.940]  it's above the law so those illegal aliens sir most of them don't even have
[58:14.940 --> 58:20.500]  to work because they're pulling five six seven eight nine ten twenty different
[58:20.500 --> 58:24.940]  welfare checks under different aliases now you know why they're driving new
[58:24.940 --> 58:29.780]  Cadillacs you understand I'll be talk about fraud and you know talk about the
[58:29.780 --> 58:33.460]  tree let's stay there we're gonna get red backment on it eight after but I'm

[58:59.460 --> 59:03.420]  off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans are
[59:03.420 --> 59:08.780]  home turn members influence on our president in Congress and they really
[59:08.780 --> 59:13.580]  are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American

[59:17.940 --> 59:23.220]  nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on

[1:00:36.900 --> 1:00:42.660]  new world order master plan is 50 years fighting it and a lot more coming up I
[1:00:42.660 --> 1:00:46.380]  just talked to him he certainly has a comment on the illegals being above the
[1:00:46.380 --> 1:00:52.220]  law I mean talk about fraud talk about unjust weights and measures it is fraud
[1:00:52.220 --> 1:00:57.780]  they are above the law they get all the free welfare citizens get nothing while

[1:01:02.260 --> 1:01:07.740]  your point well I just have noticed all you have to do is I'm not a big TV
[1:01:07.740 --> 1:01:12.980]  watcher but it knows you have to do really is watch some of the police
[1:01:12.980 --> 1:01:20.100]  documentaries like first 48 cop all you see is a bunch of criminal Mexicans
[1:01:20.100 --> 1:01:25.700]  probably most of them are illegal and they're causing havoc and nobody
[1:01:25.700 --> 1:01:31.740]  seems to care nobody you know there's a hundred million people in Mexico
[1:01:31.740 --> 1:01:38.700]  and criminals flee there and come here it's a shame you know and they've been
[1:01:38.700 --> 1:01:45.540]  doing this for how long Alex I mean when when are people gonna wake up they have
[1:01:45.540 --> 1:01:49.940]  woken up but the government whether it's Republican or Democrat is controlled
[1:01:49.940 --> 1:01:58.060]  by the new world order yeah they come at us from so many angles sometimes it's
[1:01:58.060 --> 1:02:04.000]  hard I can't imagine you know how you deal with it all but cuz I know this is
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:08.580]  how I deal with it this is how I deal with it can things would be a thousand
[1:02:08.580 --> 1:02:17.340]  percent worse if people like Red Beckman and Bill Benson and G Edward Griffin
[1:02:17.340 --> 1:02:27.380]  and Myron Fagan and Eustace Mullins and countless other people 30 40 50 60 years
[1:02:27.380 --> 1:02:34.420]  ago hadn't been telling the truth people like Gary Allen people like Bob
[1:02:34.420 --> 1:02:39.380]  Chapman they understood what was happening they warned us so other
[1:02:39.380 --> 1:02:43.940]  generations of people could wake up and we grew slowly but we are now probably
[1:02:43.940 --> 1:02:49.300]  30% of the population and it took three to five percent to win the Revolutionary
[1:02:49.300 --> 1:02:57.140]  War look 80% of the public wanted to be slaves okay and another 17% or so
[1:02:57.140 --> 1:03:00.620]  supported the Patriots but it was only about three to five percent that started
[1:03:00.620 --> 1:03:06.140]  it and wanted and so we're in the right we've got 30% in the globalist don't go
[1:03:06.140 --> 1:03:10.340]  to full martial law in the next year we'll have 50% another year or two we're
[1:03:10.340 --> 1:03:15.220]  growing that fast it's been a slow growth but it's been exponential and now
[1:03:15.220 --> 1:03:20.540]  it's doubling and and just expanding massively every few years and we'll talk
[1:03:20.540 --> 1:03:24.260]  to Red Beckman about the mass awakening and when we say mass awakening folks it
[1:03:24.260 --> 1:03:28.660]  is a mass awakening and that's why they openly said they want to restrict and
[1:03:28.660 --> 1:03:32.340]  censor and have the UN take over the internet that's openly being announced
[1:03:32.340 --> 1:03:37.060]  world governments openly being announced they tried the game of denying any of
[1:03:37.060 --> 1:03:41.300]  this existed for decades that doesn't work anymore so now they say oh well
[1:03:41.300 --> 1:03:48.980]  world governments good so that's so Ken that's why I stay in the fight I don't
[1:03:48.980 --> 1:03:54.140]  have a choice there's nowhere to run if there was some free country I'd be just
[1:03:54.140 --> 1:03:57.860]  like my ancestors jumping on the Mayflower and coming to a new land to be
[1:03:57.860 --> 1:04:02.700]  free and left alone by government there's nowhere to run my roots are here
[1:04:02.700 --> 1:04:07.820]  I'm cornered I have nowhere to go I've got to fight and that's a powerful
[1:04:07.820 --> 1:04:12.380]  position folks when you've committed that you know there's nothing else you can
[1:04:12.380 --> 1:04:16.180]  do and you realize you're gonna die regardless you might as well stand up
[1:04:16.180 --> 1:04:21.500]  and fight and just commit to it all of you so what do you think of them apples
[1:04:21.500 --> 1:04:28.180]  can oh you're about right on and I hope I hope more people awake up to what's
[1:04:28.180 --> 1:04:35.660]  going on and I try to wake up as many people as I can and I think we we got
[1:04:35.660 --> 1:04:41.140]  a chance but we all need to band together and fight against the satanic
[1:04:41.140 --> 1:04:46.180]  Hitler wannabes I hear you my friend I appreciate your call in three minutes

[1:08:21.220 --> 1:08:25.380]  States and informs juries that they're the boss not the corrupt judge or
[1:08:25.380 --> 1:08:33.020]  prosecutor Beckman documented by going to all of the states that existed when
[1:08:33.020 --> 1:08:36.860]  we got the 16th amendment for the income tax that it was never properly
[1:08:36.860 --> 1:08:45.420]  ratified and he's gonna be with us into the next hour and we're very honored to
[1:08:45.420 --> 1:08:50.940]  have him with us red thanks for coming on very good to be with you for those
[1:08:50.940 --> 1:08:54.060]  that may not know who you are we have a lot of new affiliates and listeners
[1:08:54.060 --> 1:09:00.460]  encapsulate who you are your awakening and what you've seen over the last 50
[1:09:00.460 --> 1:09:05.740]  years fighting this tyranny and where you think we are today well I think that
[1:09:05.740 --> 1:09:13.620]  when I really woke up to the fact that our government was not performing as it
[1:09:13.620 --> 1:09:19.020]  was supposed to was while I was in the military in the service during the Korean
[1:09:19.020 --> 1:09:28.020]  War and I seen things happen that didn't make sense and of course when I got
[1:09:28.020 --> 1:09:35.100]  out of the service in December of 52 I tried to be involved in the political
[1:09:35.100 --> 1:09:42.540]  process and it took me a number of years to figure out that our vote on
[1:09:42.540 --> 1:09:48.460]  election day just didn't do the job as far as controlling our government and so
[1:09:48.460 --> 1:09:55.340]  I had to do some studying and all and of course I discovered that our votes we
[1:09:55.340 --> 1:10:01.060]  have a three-vote system not a one-vote system because we have learned to our
[1:10:01.060 --> 1:10:06.700]  sorrow that just electing people to Congress and such that we don't have
[1:10:06.700 --> 1:10:11.580]  the control that we should have and the founders were wise men and they put the
[1:10:11.580 --> 1:10:18.220]  grand jury system in and they put the trial jury system in and both the
[1:10:18.220 --> 1:10:24.540]  grand jury and the trial jury had been in existence for centuries prior to our
[1:10:24.540 --> 1:10:32.540]  war of independence and so I found that the the juries had the power to nullify
[1:10:32.540 --> 1:10:38.940]  law and that the we the people are the sovereign we're not we're not the
[1:10:38.940 --> 1:10:46.180]  peons of government we are to control government and and of course the
[1:10:46.180 --> 1:10:50.980]  government control the schools the education process they actually control
[1:10:50.980 --> 1:10:58.380]  the churches and the media and you have hit it so hard over the years about how
[1:10:58.380 --> 1:11:04.380]  they are attacking our minds and and trying to control our minds and they
[1:11:04.380 --> 1:11:11.260]  do that by feeding us a lot of propaganda a lot of lives and so we have
[1:11:11.260 --> 1:11:18.220]  overcome that and today we have an exciting situation going on in this
[1:11:18.220 --> 1:11:24.420]  country with all the tea parties the oathkeepers the full-informed juries all
[1:11:24.420 --> 1:11:30.020]  these Sheriff Mack all these things are happening right now and of course here I
[1:11:30.020 --> 1:11:36.220]  am at 81 years of age and I'm getting to see all of this I'm getting to enjoy
[1:11:36.220 --> 1:11:43.020]  what's happening we the people on you know the the concept the Declaration of
[1:11:43.020 --> 1:11:48.180]  Independence says that the government derives are just powers from the
[1:11:48.180 --> 1:11:53.220]  consent of the government well if they can tamper with the minds of the people
[1:11:53.220 --> 1:12:00.820]  then they can derive unjust powers they get unjust powers and we the people pay
[1:12:00.820 --> 1:12:07.540]  the bills and that's what has happened to us in this country too much of our
[1:12:07.540 --> 1:12:13.620]  power the people power has been transferred to government now government
[1:12:13.620 --> 1:12:17.660]  isn't going to give that power back they're not just going to give it back
[1:12:17.660 --> 1:12:22.500]  when we say we want our power back they're a greedy bunch and they will
[1:12:22.500 --> 1:12:30.380]  keep your power until we take it back we have to take our power back and boy
[1:12:30.380 --> 1:12:35.180]  I'll tell you I'm seeing it happen I'm seeing the things that are happening
[1:12:35.180 --> 1:12:43.700]  all across this country and it's a real exciting time in 1989 I wrote my little
[1:12:43.700 --> 1:12:48.500]  book walls on our minds and I made the statement how that Germany was the first
[1:12:48.500 --> 1:12:54.340]  country to be conquered by the Nazis and of course Germany paid an awful price
[1:12:54.340 --> 1:13:00.140]  for letting an enemy within conquer the nation they paid the price of
[1:13:00.140 --> 1:13:06.580]  World War two the Russians or the Russian people they had an enemy within
[1:13:06.580 --> 1:13:14.580]  the communist and and they suffered for about 75 years because they allowed an
[1:13:14.580 --> 1:13:20.660]  enemy within and of course in 89 I wrote about how our government had become an
[1:13:20.660 --> 1:13:29.940]  enemy within and that our future was somewhat cloudy and here we are 20
[1:13:29.940 --> 1:13:36.220]  years later and of course at that time I said that we would probably have an
[1:13:36.220 --> 1:13:43.220]  economic crash our meltdown and that would open the door and people would
[1:13:43.220 --> 1:13:50.220]  wake up and so Alex we're seeing it and what a thrill it is there's the added
[1:13:50.220 --> 1:13:54.700]  there's the added danger though that people are waking up because now the
[1:13:54.700 --> 1:13:58.180]  enemy is trying to fully implode the country so they can control it and
[1:13:58.180 --> 1:14:02.580]  robbing us of tens of trillions of dollars a year and launching all these
[1:14:02.580 --> 1:14:06.260]  new wars in our name and so it's good that people are waking up but they
[1:14:06.260 --> 1:14:12.060]  should be because we're in very very dire straits red backman from your 50
[1:14:12.060 --> 1:14:16.740]  years of study who runs the new world order what is the new world order what
[1:14:16.740 --> 1:14:21.940]  is this system how do the central banks get so much power well I'll tell you
[1:14:21.940 --> 1:14:31.340]  every generation every generation will always produce a certain number of well
[1:14:31.340 --> 1:14:37.580]  some people call them mattoids they're mental cripples who think that they are
[1:14:37.580 --> 1:14:42.940]  far superior to anybody else and that they have a well they used to call it
[1:14:42.940 --> 1:14:49.420]  the divine right of kings and and and our generations are no different I've
[1:14:49.420 --> 1:14:55.540]  seen three generations now at my age we have these people show up and they
[1:14:55.540 --> 1:15:01.780]  really belong in mental institutions but we don't we end up following them
[1:15:01.780 --> 1:15:07.820]  because they usually have enough propaganda and such to where they can
[1:15:07.820 --> 1:15:12.700]  and they line up enough suckers to believe what they are trying to tell
[1:15:12.700 --> 1:15:19.140]  you tell you and of course over the history of our country we've had some
[1:15:19.140 --> 1:15:25.700]  of these people always trying to get a central bank and and of course we've
[1:15:25.700 --> 1:15:30.420]  had a couple of presidents that said no they understood what how dangerous a
[1:15:30.420 --> 1:15:38.740]  central bank is well in 1913 of course we got the income tax and the 17th
[1:15:38.740 --> 1:15:45.260]  amendment we got the Federal Reserve Bank because we had well we had about
[1:15:45.260 --> 1:15:51.220]  30 million immigrants in this country that had come from Western Europe and
[1:15:51.220 --> 1:15:56.060]  they hadn't really assimilated to the point where they understood our language
[1:15:56.060 --> 1:16:03.660]  our political system and all of that and and they were too easily manipulated
[1:16:03.660 --> 1:16:09.020]  that's how Wilson became president of the United States as far as I'm
[1:16:09.020 --> 1:16:14.140]  concerned that's what happened and of course we have somewhat of a parallel
[1:16:14.140 --> 1:16:19.660]  today we have so many of these immigrants and so many of them are
[1:16:19.660 --> 1:16:27.580]  illegal and as I told you before we went on the air I I had recently written
[1:16:27.580 --> 1:16:37.380]  a an op-ed piece and I told how that the Roe v. Wade decision the abortion
[1:16:37.380 --> 1:16:44.380]  thing those first people that lost their lives in in the abortion mill back
[1:16:44.380 --> 1:16:49.060]  there would now be 37 38 years old in the prime of their life of their
[1:16:49.060 --> 1:16:55.780]  productive life and and we have now murdered over 50 million and that's our
[1:16:55.780 --> 1:17:01.420]  workforce that we we eliminated through the abortion thing and globalist in
[1:17:01.420 --> 1:17:05.220]  many of their own documents admit that was their plan kill off the Americans
[1:17:05.220 --> 1:17:09.540]  bring in the foreigners yeah and they'll pull the lever for gun control big
[1:17:09.540 --> 1:17:14.540]  government yeah everything and it's now happening yeah it's there was that
[1:17:14.540 --> 1:17:21.060]  vacuum in our workforce and they brought in all these illegals and they want
[1:17:21.060 --> 1:17:26.580]  they're working very hard to give them amnesty and of course they give them
[1:17:26.580 --> 1:17:30.940]  all our social security money they give them all their free health care and
[1:17:30.940 --> 1:17:36.580]  everything and we the people of this country we're getting the short end of
[1:17:36.580 --> 1:17:40.380]  the stick and we subsidized driving down our own wages and with the consul
[1:17:40.380 --> 1:17:45.860]  matricula on record they will give unlimited numbers of these two
[1:17:45.860 --> 1:17:50.140]  citizens now other countries are duplicating what Mexico's done to where
[1:17:50.140 --> 1:17:54.660]  they literally are godlike with all the identities they want everything they
[1:17:54.660 --> 1:17:59.820]  want it's a second set of rules designed to cripple the country absolutely and
[1:17:59.820 --> 1:18:04.020]  by the way that's not our opinion we now have the the head climatologist at
[1:18:04.020 --> 1:18:08.140]  NASA we have more he's strong all of them saying the carbon tax is meant to
[1:18:08.140 --> 1:18:12.420]  destroy our society they want to destroy us to make us dependent
[1:18:12.420 --> 1:18:20.580]  absolutely and but I'll tell you with the numbers of people that we have
[1:18:20.580 --> 1:18:27.380]  involved and of course the biggest thing of all Alex you remember in the
[1:18:27.380 --> 1:18:34.460]  Reagan years it seemed like the communists in Russia were a threat and
[1:18:34.460 --> 1:18:39.500]  Reagan built up the military were president Reagan built up the military
[1:18:39.500 --> 1:18:46.820]  and and they called it a taunt you remember that yes okay that's what we've
[1:18:46.820 --> 1:18:53.860]  got now some of the figures we've got somewhere between 200 and 220 million of
[1:18:53.860 --> 1:19:00.660]  our American people that have armed themselves to the teeth we have we they
[1:19:00.660 --> 1:19:05.980]  they tell us that there were over 14 million weapons sold in the United
[1:19:05.980 --> 1:19:12.740]  States in oh nine this is this is they taught that that's what we've got it
[1:19:12.740 --> 1:19:18.660]  right here in this country because the people are voting and letting the New
[1:19:18.660 --> 1:19:25.220]  World Order know that this means war absolutely we've drawn our line in the
[1:19:25.220 --> 1:19:30.980]  sand and and I'll tell you the New World Order people that are really
[1:19:30.980 --> 1:19:38.220]  promoting it they're they're running scared they're running afraid and you

[1:25:05.100 --> 1:25:12.500]  you're saying you have 14 million next instant checks last year in just a month
[1:25:12.500 --> 1:25:20.940]  and a few days there's been another three million people are accelerating how
[1:25:20.940 --> 1:25:24.620]  fast they're getting firearms obama's introduced all these anti-gun bills
[1:25:24.620 --> 1:25:29.140]  much of his administration openly calls for outright gunbands but then they
[1:25:29.140 --> 1:25:33.420]  try the old tried and trusted propaganda term of saying it's a conspiracy we
[1:25:33.420 --> 1:25:38.580]  don't want your guns but people are now finding out their liars it seems the
[1:25:38.580 --> 1:25:43.500]  system is using all its old lies when they had air superiority and total media
[1:25:43.500 --> 1:25:50.940]  control they don't anymore red absolutely yeah this this this day
[1:25:50.940 --> 1:26:01.260]  top i i think we really need to do you know use that and send a message to the
[1:26:01.260 --> 1:26:07.460]  to the gang of thieves there in washington dc that you know we are
[1:26:07.460 --> 1:26:13.540]  onto what they're doing we understand what they're trying to do and they have
[1:26:13.540 --> 1:26:21.540]  to have our power they have to be able to tap into our power and and and they're
[1:26:21.540 --> 1:26:26.540]  losing that we're taking our power back i think we're going to be able to
[1:26:26.540 --> 1:26:33.420]  destroy the tax court simply by by pointing out the fact that federal
[1:26:33.420 --> 1:26:40.500]  judges are federal agents they are government agents and they can't make
[1:26:40.500 --> 1:26:44.020]  findings of fact and conclusions of law because they have a conflict of
[1:26:44.020 --> 1:26:49.740]  interest and uh... and so this is just one of the the things of the good news
[1:26:49.740 --> 1:26:55.100]  items that coming down and of course i are yesterday paper just throw me to
[1:26:55.100 --> 1:27:00.740]  death because i'm out here in the state of washington right now and uh... the
[1:27:00.740 --> 1:27:08.220]  state legislature and olympia they are in session and they are considering a
[1:27:08.220 --> 1:27:16.180]  half a dozen different bills to uh... nullify the federal court decision
[1:27:16.180 --> 1:27:23.460]  kilo versus uh... uh... the new london uh... connecticut uh... city of new
[1:27:23.460 --> 1:27:28.140]  london uh... that was that eminent domain thing that uh... the court gave
[1:27:28.140 --> 1:27:33.060]  them the right to take private property uh... through eminent domain and then
[1:27:33.060 --> 1:27:38.300]  give it to the private uh... organization and so here we've got all
[1:27:38.300 --> 1:27:43.380]  these states across the country the state legislatures are stepping up to the
[1:27:43.380 --> 1:27:50.060]  plate and they're nullifying that federal court decision and it's going to
[1:27:50.060 --> 1:27:54.940]  pass here in washington there's no question about it the local paper
[1:27:54.940 --> 1:27:59.060]  uh... they had quite an editorial in yesterday's issue
[1:27:59.060 --> 1:28:04.700]  and uh... and the and the newspaper the local newspaper is promoting this they
[1:28:04.700 --> 1:28:06.380]  are pushing
[1:28:06.380 --> 1:28:09.540]  uh... to get this legislation passed
[1:28:09.540 --> 1:28:14.260]  uh... in our state legislature and it's happening all over the nation
[1:28:14.260 --> 1:28:16.620]  uh... congressman ron paul
[1:28:16.620 --> 1:28:18.620]  uh... he has
[1:28:18.620 --> 1:28:24.220]  uh... identified what's going on in the state legislatures he's done it uh...
[1:28:24.220 --> 1:28:26.140]  he's named it he said he's
[1:28:26.140 --> 1:28:28.060]  he's uh... defined it
[1:28:28.060 --> 1:28:30.380]  as nullification
[1:28:30.380 --> 1:28:33.900]  uh... state legislatures like in montana
[1:28:33.900 --> 1:28:35.620]  my home state
[1:28:35.620 --> 1:28:39.460]  uh... they're done control thing last year they're they're done well
[1:28:39.460 --> 1:28:44.300]  sample manufacturer on firearms and so the bottom line is yes as long as people
[1:28:44.300 --> 1:28:46.500]  realize this is the long fight
[1:28:46.500 --> 1:28:52.020]  and don't expect instant gratification for liberty and just slowly continually
[1:28:52.020 --> 1:28:56.700]  press against the enemy against their machinery we have right we have history
[1:28:56.700 --> 1:28:58.020]  we have the people
[1:28:58.020 --> 1:29:00.980]  on our side we will win but read when we come back
[1:29:00.980 --> 1:29:04.740]  i'm concerned about false flag stage terror

[1:34:21.220 --> 1:34:25.060]  operations i'm not risking my life i'm not
[1:34:25.060 --> 1:34:28.820]  fighting 14 15 some days 18 hours a day some days
[1:34:28.820 --> 1:34:34.020]  24 hours a day against the globalist because i think i'm going to lose
[1:34:34.020 --> 1:34:38.500]  these people are dangerous killers they run the planet they do whatever they
[1:34:38.500 --> 1:34:41.940]  want but history shows tyrants always reach too far
[1:34:41.940 --> 1:34:45.220]  i wouldn't be fighting them and risking my life
[1:34:45.220 --> 1:34:49.300]  if i didn't know they could be beaten i know
[1:34:49.300 --> 1:34:52.660]  they can be beaten i know they will be beaten and
[1:34:52.660 --> 1:34:56.420]  if you listen to my show 10 years ago it was a lot more negative than it is now
[1:34:56.420 --> 1:34:59.380]  i said if we don't wake people up if we don't educate people
[1:34:59.380 --> 1:35:02.660]  about the true architecture of world government if we don't
[1:35:02.660 --> 1:35:06.660]  educate them as the control banking collapse comes we have the imf and world
[1:35:06.660 --> 1:35:09.300]  bank documents we know what they've done in every other country
[1:35:09.300 --> 1:35:13.380]  we know what they've done in england and in in in 1815 with the roth childs
[1:35:13.380 --> 1:35:16.980]  if we don't do this and if we don't educate the military and police
[1:35:16.980 --> 1:35:20.500]  that they're expendable and being used and brainwashed then these people are
[1:35:20.500 --> 1:35:24.020]  going to win but i started waging war 16 years
[1:35:24.020 --> 1:35:26.820]  ago against the tyranny 14 years ago on air
[1:35:26.820 --> 1:35:31.620]  red backman back in the early 1950s and it takes time
[1:35:31.620 --> 1:35:34.980]  and and that's the number one message now going back to red backman and then your
[1:35:34.980 --> 1:35:39.220]  phone calls and a lot of other issues red i was asking you the question of the
[1:35:39.220 --> 1:35:43.700]  enemy's counter operations i mean i am shocked by
[1:35:43.700 --> 1:35:47.620]  how out in the open they are now i guess that's hubris or
[1:35:47.620 --> 1:35:50.740]  or or false arrogance or a face they're putting on
[1:35:50.740 --> 1:35:55.220]  because their internal documents from cast sunstein the congress the un
[1:35:55.220 --> 1:35:58.900]  stuff they don't widely publicize but that is publicly available
[1:35:58.900 --> 1:36:01.940]  they say they're in deep danger they are freaking out
[1:36:01.940 --> 1:36:06.500]  saying we've got to go with shutting down web arresting people that criticize
[1:36:06.500 --> 1:36:10.260]  government we've got to go to a hot tyranny not a cold
[1:36:10.260 --> 1:36:14.260]  incremental tyranny which is good because the cold incremental tyranny is
[1:36:14.260 --> 1:36:18.100]  hard to beat because it sneaks around like
[1:36:18.100 --> 1:36:22.660]  sissaro said inside your gates i i like it
[1:36:22.660 --> 1:36:26.500]  that they're coming right out in the open and and and so why do you think
[1:36:26.500 --> 1:36:29.220]  they're openly announcing world government why do you think
[1:36:29.220 --> 1:36:33.300]  they're openly shifting from denying all this to admitting it
[1:36:33.300 --> 1:36:38.100]  but putting their spin on it and how do you see them counter striking
[1:36:38.100 --> 1:36:41.060]  well you know i i think that's so much of this
[1:36:41.060 --> 1:36:45.780]  is um uh... the spin masters of course
[1:36:45.780 --> 1:36:50.900]  uh... they're just paid these are people that are paid to come up with all
[1:36:50.900 --> 1:36:55.300]  this stuff i think that they're in a state of terror
[1:36:55.300 --> 1:36:59.460]  uh... they're they're looking for a place to hide
[1:36:59.460 --> 1:37:05.700]  uh... they're uh... uh... you know everything is going backwards for them
[1:37:05.700 --> 1:37:09.300]  they're not getting that the job done they're not getting the guns they're
[1:37:09.300 --> 1:37:11.380]  not going to get the guns
[1:37:11.380 --> 1:37:15.620]  uh... i mean they might get what comes out the end of the barrel
[1:37:15.620 --> 1:37:19.220]  uh... the gun but they're not going to get the gun itself
[1:37:19.220 --> 1:37:25.140]  and uh... i think that uh... you know nine one one
[1:37:25.140 --> 1:37:31.220]  they were able to uh... you know fully american people initially and into
[1:37:31.220 --> 1:37:36.180]  thinking it was uh... uh... those uh... foreigners those
[1:37:36.180 --> 1:37:41.140]  aliens that had pulled us off uh... taking control of those planes and flying
[1:37:41.140 --> 1:37:45.780]  into the world trade center how many americans today
[1:37:45.780 --> 1:37:50.740]  are there that that still believe that very very very few
[1:37:50.740 --> 1:37:55.780]  and what we have is we've got hundreds of people
[1:37:55.780 --> 1:38:01.060]  all over this nation that are trying to put the pieces together
[1:38:01.060 --> 1:38:04.740]  they're collecting the evidence and uh...
[1:38:04.740 --> 1:38:10.820]  i would dare say that there's some people out there that pulled that off
[1:38:10.820 --> 1:38:13.220]  uh... they're right here in this country
[1:38:13.220 --> 1:38:18.100]  uh... they've got an escape hatch they'll fly to uh... some other country or
[1:38:18.100 --> 1:38:21.220]  something when it gets too hot but they're still here
[1:38:21.220 --> 1:38:25.140]  but i would dare say they kind of rub their necks once in a while and and
[1:38:25.140 --> 1:38:30.100]  uh... and i wonder if they kind of feel that rope settling around their neck
[1:38:30.100 --> 1:38:33.780]  because uh... if they if they take another
[1:38:33.780 --> 1:38:38.100]  do another dirty trick like they did nine one one
[1:38:38.100 --> 1:38:41.620]  i'll tell you there's going to be some people that are going to get
[1:38:41.620 --> 1:38:45.460]  rounded up and uh... they're going to be prosecuted for
[1:38:45.460 --> 1:38:49.540]  treason and the whole works and and uh... they're going to end up hanging
[1:38:49.540 --> 1:38:52.980]  from uh... from a gallows someplace because
[1:38:52.980 --> 1:38:56.900]  the american people are not going to sit still
[1:38:56.900 --> 1:39:00.820]  for any more of their false flags it's not going to happen
[1:39:00.820 --> 1:39:04.020]  and i think that what we've got going on in
[1:39:04.020 --> 1:39:09.620]  in iraq and afghanistan right now i think that the military
[1:39:09.620 --> 1:39:15.220]  uh... their uh... they're doing some thinking on their own they're not
[1:39:15.220 --> 1:39:19.620]  depending on uh... obama to give them a sense of direction
[1:39:19.620 --> 1:39:23.300]  i think they are getting along with the iraqi
[1:39:23.300 --> 1:39:26.340]  uh... people like they have never done
[1:39:26.340 --> 1:39:30.020]  they're getting along with the afghan if you're if you're reading between the
[1:39:30.020 --> 1:39:32.820]  lines and and uh... even not
[1:39:32.820 --> 1:39:37.060]  always between the lines uh... we're getting a different picture
[1:39:37.060 --> 1:39:42.900]  coming from both afghanistan and iraq because i think our military
[1:39:42.900 --> 1:39:46.980]  i think the we've got some people in there that have enough smarts to
[1:39:46.980 --> 1:39:52.420]  recognize that we cannot finance all these wars out there
[1:39:52.420 --> 1:39:56.820]  such as we've been doing well the attempt is to bankrupt the nation it's to
[1:39:56.820 --> 1:40:01.140]  bankrupt the states to the bankers who made all this money out of fiat
[1:40:01.140 --> 1:40:04.020]  thin air and want to bankrupt us just like a
[1:40:04.020 --> 1:40:07.700]  local bank wants to bankrupt the farmer they want the land
[1:40:07.700 --> 1:40:12.500]  sure and uh... but uh... i'll tell you uh...
[1:40:12.500 --> 1:40:16.900]  uh... it's coming to an end and coming very very rapidly
[1:40:16.900 --> 1:40:19.700]  uh... much faster than i would have ever
[1:40:19.700 --> 1:40:24.980]  uh... thought that it could happen uh... because i see it happening uh...
[1:40:24.980 --> 1:40:29.380]  well the last time i was on your show several months ago
[1:40:29.380 --> 1:40:33.700]  uh... you know uh... you you put my address on there and we said anybody
[1:40:33.700 --> 1:40:37.060]  that sends a five dollar bill will send them a copy of that little book walls
[1:40:37.060 --> 1:40:40.820]  on our minds we sent out hundreds of them
[1:40:40.820 --> 1:40:44.100]  we had never i've done hundreds of talk shows
[1:40:44.100 --> 1:40:49.620]  and i have never never had the response that we had from that show
[1:40:49.620 --> 1:40:54.820]  uh... we were on i was on for at least an hour i think but uh...
[1:40:54.820 --> 1:40:58.900]  we got a tremendous response well which is another indicator
[1:40:58.900 --> 1:41:02.500]  of how large the radio shows gotten but how
[1:41:02.500 --> 1:41:06.020]  active the people are and how hungry they are
[1:41:06.020 --> 1:41:11.460]  for information uh... read so much uh... so much other stuff is going on
[1:41:11.460 --> 1:41:15.380]  and uh... happening but you look at how
[1:41:15.380 --> 1:41:19.060]  they do create walls in our minds they paint false pictures
[1:41:19.060 --> 1:41:22.820]  obama is expanding all these wars increasing the military budget
[1:41:22.820 --> 1:41:26.500]  while cutting the pay to the troops uh... last year he tried to make troops
[1:41:26.500 --> 1:41:30.180]  by their own insurance i even had the head of
[1:41:30.180 --> 1:41:34.660]  i even had the head of the american legion on speaking out against it
[1:41:34.660 --> 1:41:37.380]  uh... but then they spent it to say the troops are angry
[1:41:37.380 --> 1:41:41.700]  they say obama isn't waging enough wars they say obama
[1:41:41.700 --> 1:41:46.100]  isn't giving him the surge they need which is total false reality
[1:41:46.100 --> 1:41:49.540]  the troops know we're going bankrupt they know it's a fraud they know it's a
[1:41:49.540 --> 1:41:52.340]  lie they don't want to be there but the media
[1:41:52.340 --> 1:41:55.460]  creates this fake spin that obama's a liberal
[1:41:55.460 --> 1:41:59.140]  against the war when he's actually expanding it
[1:41:59.140 --> 1:42:02.820]  it's just a what do you call an entire envelopment
[1:42:02.820 --> 1:42:08.260]  of lies we're just everything is a lie wrapped in a lie stacked in a lie
[1:42:08.260 --> 1:42:12.340]  packaged in another lie uh... it just isn't working anymore
[1:42:12.340 --> 1:42:16.740]  everything they do the people see right through it take the hopes of obama
[1:42:16.740 --> 1:42:19.620]  people woken up to him faster than any other puppet
[1:42:19.620 --> 1:42:24.900]  yeah well i you know uh... nine one one how many people
[1:42:24.900 --> 1:42:31.460]  are you know you know investigating all the little things uh... that happened
[1:42:31.460 --> 1:42:35.540]  with nine one one and they're getting a picture
[1:42:35.540 --> 1:42:40.900]  uh... of what happened and it has to be making some people
[1:42:40.900 --> 1:42:46.420]  uh... very very nervous and of course the same goes for oklahoma city
[1:42:46.420 --> 1:42:51.940]  uh... we know that was an inside job and uh... there's people after all these
[1:42:51.940 --> 1:42:55.300]  years people are still putting the pieces together
[1:42:55.300 --> 1:43:00.980]  and uh... so uh... i i think that uh... there is a possibility of another
[1:43:00.980 --> 1:43:05.060]  false flag uh... operation but uh...
[1:43:05.060 --> 1:43:08.740]  uh... i i got assure you of one thing
[1:43:08.740 --> 1:43:14.100]  that if there's a false flag operation they're not going to be able to
[1:43:14.100 --> 1:43:18.580]  call it anything else right from the beginning because the american people
[1:43:18.580 --> 1:43:23.060]  now have their eyes wide open that's right we've taken
[1:43:23.060 --> 1:43:27.540]  open and uh... you know i used to say that
[1:43:27.540 --> 1:43:31.780]  uh... people just didn't listen to what we were saying back there twenty thirty
[1:43:31.780 --> 1:43:35.060]  years ago but i said when we have an economic
[1:43:35.060 --> 1:43:39.220]  uh... holocaust hit us in this country
[1:43:39.220 --> 1:43:42.980]  their hearing will get better and and that's
[1:43:42.980 --> 1:43:46.580]  that's what happened people are listening to what
[1:43:46.580 --> 1:43:49.860]  alex jones is saying they're listening to what red beckman's
[1:43:49.860 --> 1:43:53.060]  has said and and they're reading the books
[1:43:53.060 --> 1:43:59.220]  and uh... so uh... it's uh... of course you know me i've always been an
[1:43:59.220 --> 1:44:02.660]  optimist i've always said we're going to pull this
[1:44:02.660 --> 1:44:06.340]  thing out and uh... i'm still convinced of it
[1:44:06.340 --> 1:44:10.980]  and more convinced than i've ever been uh... in all these years because of
[1:44:10.980 --> 1:44:16.340]  what i have seen all red you know you get tea party people by the millions out
[1:44:16.340 --> 1:44:19.300]  there and and this is something we need to uh...
[1:44:19.300 --> 1:44:25.300]  to do and that is uh... encourage all these tea party organizations across
[1:44:25.300 --> 1:44:29.620]  the country now i was on a talk show here a couple weeks ago and the fellow
[1:44:29.620 --> 1:44:33.460]  said he was from colorado he said there's sixteen
[1:44:33.460 --> 1:44:39.700]  uh... separate tea party groups in the state of colorado that he knew of
[1:44:39.700 --> 1:44:45.460]  now we want to encourage all of these uh... small groups around the country
[1:44:45.460 --> 1:44:49.780]  whether they're uh... sheriff mac uh... people whether they're
[1:44:49.780 --> 1:44:52.820]  uh... tea party people or old keepers
[1:44:52.820 --> 1:44:59.220]  uh... they need to keep their their local organization
[1:44:59.220 --> 1:45:02.020]  autonomous yes don't
[1:45:02.020 --> 1:45:07.220]  don't do like uh... and come up with something uh... top heavy organization
[1:45:07.220 --> 1:45:09.300]  like the nr a
[1:45:09.300 --> 1:45:12.500]  the nr a the national red rifle association we don't know what they're
[1:45:12.500 --> 1:45:16.180]  going to do about well read read let me jump in there for a minute exactly
[1:45:16.180 --> 1:45:20.180]  they've sent in glenn beck who is as funny as a three dollar bill
[1:45:20.180 --> 1:45:23.860]  and sarah palin uh... you know mccain's minion that's all you know
[1:45:23.860 --> 1:45:28.260]  to take it over but the good news is we're actually going into the larger
[1:45:28.260 --> 1:45:32.180]  organization they're trying to create and using that to educate
[1:45:32.180 --> 1:45:35.700]  good americans who are seeking after the truth
[1:45:35.700 --> 1:45:39.140]  and they're pulling their hair out because they're trying to co-opt us
[1:45:39.140 --> 1:45:42.740]  instead we're co-opting their attempted co-opt
[1:45:42.740 --> 1:45:45.940]  and and and they're panicking so i want you to comment on that but then going
[1:45:45.940 --> 1:45:47.540]  back to false flag
[1:45:47.540 --> 1:45:51.860]  look at how curt haskell his wife and all these other witnesses on the plane
[1:45:51.860 --> 1:45:56.820]  it turns out our nine eleven truthers and so they recognize the other bomber
[1:45:56.820 --> 1:46:00.740]  the government helping get him on uh... him on the plane in amsterdam
[1:46:00.740 --> 1:46:03.860]  they stood their ground against the fb i
[1:46:03.860 --> 1:46:07.380]  and two weeks after three weeks after the fb i had to come out and say okay we
[1:46:07.380 --> 1:46:09.300]  ordered the state department let him on the plane
[1:46:09.300 --> 1:46:12.020]  we were watching him and protecting him just like nine eleven
[1:46:12.020 --> 1:46:15.860]  and uh... you know we let it happen and rich comes out in mits
[1:46:15.860 --> 1:46:18.580]  they would issue fake terror alerts in his new book
[1:46:18.580 --> 1:46:23.060]  i mean we've gone to the point of now where people didn't know the term false
[1:46:23.060 --> 1:46:24.660]  flag or inside job or
[1:46:24.660 --> 1:46:27.380]  self-inflicted wound or rice stag event
[1:46:27.380 --> 1:46:31.220]  or stage terror attack or a gaelian dialectic and now
[1:46:31.220 --> 1:46:34.340]  the general public does understand that and we've got polls
[1:46:34.340 --> 1:46:38.500]  of over ninety percent in gallup it was seventy five six months ago
[1:46:38.500 --> 1:46:42.580]  wanting to abolish or audit the fed i mean folks when i tell you
[1:46:42.580 --> 1:46:45.140]  now again they're coming down on us were in the war
[1:46:45.140 --> 1:46:48.580]  they're attacking us we're in deep trouble they're passing laws everywhere
[1:46:48.580 --> 1:46:52.100]  attacks food now which only tyrants do
[1:46:52.100 --> 1:46:56.100]  i mean we're in bad shape but at least we know we're being attacked
[1:46:56.100 --> 1:46:59.940]  at least we're not in a coma at least we're finding our legs
[1:46:59.940 --> 1:47:03.060]  and anybody who's been in a fight knows once you start swinging you're not
[1:47:03.060 --> 1:47:06.420]  worried about it and and start america is starting
[1:47:06.420 --> 1:47:09.540]  to swing and the world is starting to swing
[1:47:09.540 --> 1:47:13.060]  and they're discovering the enemy is not the puppet politicians
[1:47:13.060 --> 1:47:16.580]  it's the stinking central bankers it's the new world order
[1:47:16.580 --> 1:47:20.740]  so red going back to the underwear bomber and then also the attempted
[1:47:20.740 --> 1:47:22.980]  co-opting of the uh... tea parties
[1:47:22.980 --> 1:47:27.380]  well you know the underwear underwear
[1:47:27.380 --> 1:47:31.220]  excuse me get some water
[1:47:31.220 --> 1:47:35.780]  uh... the uh... the uh... underwear bomber
[1:47:35.780 --> 1:47:39.460]  uh... this proves what i'm saying that
[1:47:39.460 --> 1:47:44.180]  uh... people are now very much alert when something like this happens they are
[1:47:44.180 --> 1:47:47.300]  immediately right in there getting the clues
[1:47:47.300 --> 1:47:51.460]  and and it didn't take a long time rather than it
[1:47:51.460 --> 1:47:55.140]  i mean they unraveled it and uh... it's uh...
[1:47:55.140 --> 1:47:59.460]  it's an embarrassment uh... to the establishment
[1:47:59.460 --> 1:48:04.500]  to uh... find out that uh... you know us us people out here
[1:48:04.500 --> 1:48:08.420]  uh... we can unravel their their their schemes
[1:48:08.420 --> 1:48:12.660]  their conspiracies that's what it is they call us conspirators
[1:48:12.660 --> 1:48:16.980]  there that they are the conspiracy we now have their handbook
[1:48:16.980 --> 1:48:20.020]  absolutely
[1:48:20.020 --> 1:48:24.100]  it's just uh... uh... it's a new ball game
[1:48:24.100 --> 1:48:28.020]  from what it was five years ago it's a game changer
[1:48:28.020 --> 1:48:32.740]  absolutely it's just uh... absolutely amazing
[1:48:32.740 --> 1:48:37.140]  and a thrill a real thrill for me but just because we've got the ball doesn't
[1:48:37.140 --> 1:48:41.300]  mean we've won the game that's that's true but we're gonna win it and
[1:48:41.300 --> 1:48:45.300]  uh... by now if they don't know we're gonna win it
[1:48:45.300 --> 1:48:49.620]  uh... they're not very smart as they thought they were
[1:48:49.620 --> 1:48:52.980]  well read i've never heard you this positive you're really excited
[1:48:52.980 --> 1:48:57.380]  well i i just uh... you know i'm on the phone a great deal
[1:48:57.380 --> 1:49:03.140]  talking to people all over this country and uh... and i just get such a
[1:49:03.140 --> 1:49:08.740]  fantastic response uh... uh... my books are uh...
[1:49:08.740 --> 1:49:13.220]  you know i wrote uh... born again republic in nineteen eighty the fall of
[1:49:13.220 --> 1:49:17.780]  nineteen eighty uh... that book is still in print
[1:49:17.780 --> 1:49:21.380]  and and of course my last book uh... why the militia
[1:49:21.380 --> 1:49:26.660]  boy i'll tell you it's uh... uh... people read that they say there is a
[1:49:26.660 --> 1:49:29.700]  primer that every patriot needs to read
[1:49:29.700 --> 1:49:33.620]  uh... and of course walls in our minds it'll go on forever
[1:49:33.620 --> 1:49:37.940]  and uh... i joke about it might say uh... i'm eighty one but uh...
[1:49:37.940 --> 1:49:42.100]  and i'm not gonna last forever but i'm gonna kick butt after i'm gone
[1:49:42.100 --> 1:49:45.300]  haha that's the great part about it isn't it
[1:49:45.300 --> 1:49:49.300]  once you've told the truth once you've told the truth it always stands
[1:49:49.300 --> 1:49:53.700]  yeah yeah well i'll tell you
[1:49:53.700 --> 1:50:00.980]  uh... it's you know it is such an exciting thing
[1:50:00.980 --> 1:50:05.380]  when you talk to people that in the past they wouldn't listen to you
[1:50:05.380 --> 1:50:10.340]  they wouldn't pay attention to you now they're coming and saying hey
[1:50:10.340 --> 1:50:14.980]  you told us that this was gonna happen and we didn't believe you but it's here
[1:50:14.980 --> 1:50:17.380]  well that's the other big one i want to come back and talk to you about that
[1:50:17.380 --> 1:50:21.140]  and get into some other issues and take calls red beckman joining us
[1:50:21.140 --> 1:50:25.380]  is that you didn't just get it partly right ron paul didn't just get it
[1:50:25.380 --> 1:50:28.100]  partly right i didn't just get it partly right
[1:50:28.100 --> 1:50:32.180]  i mean we because we saw what the same group of crooks did all over the world
[1:50:32.180 --> 1:50:36.100]  in different countries we told people exactly what they were going to do
[1:50:36.100 --> 1:50:40.420]  and the power of it then coming true uh...
[1:50:40.420 --> 1:50:46.500]  it's amazing the final illusion to fall is that we're the minority no we are the
[1:50:46.500 --> 1:50:50.020]  majority i mean i've even got yuppie neighbors
[1:50:50.020 --> 1:50:52.820]  that were laughing at me two years ago they're not laughing now they're saying

[1:54:13.620 --> 1:54:18.660]  start taking some phone calls and read some twitter questions for you
[1:54:18.660 --> 1:54:21.620]  but the first thing i wanted to get into now is
[1:54:21.620 --> 1:54:25.540]  encapsulate the three votes that americans have
[1:54:25.540 --> 1:54:29.780]  contrary to what they've been indoctrinated with only having the ballot
[1:54:29.780 --> 1:54:35.940]  box yes um with our vote on election day
[1:54:35.940 --> 1:54:39.860]  i you know we went to the polls and
[1:54:39.860 --> 1:54:43.700]  we ended up we weren't voting for somebody we wanted we
[1:54:43.700 --> 1:54:48.020]  voted against somebody almost invariably in my lifetime that's what
[1:54:48.020 --> 1:54:52.340]  happened and uh... and so our vote on election day
[1:54:52.340 --> 1:54:57.060]  was stolen because uh... george bush senior of course he said
[1:54:57.060 --> 1:55:02.260]  read my lips no new taxes and uh... he got elected
[1:55:02.260 --> 1:55:07.220]  and uh... and of course he violated his campaign promise well as far as i'm
[1:55:07.220 --> 1:55:10.740]  concerned he stole every vote that uh... people gave him
[1:55:10.740 --> 1:55:14.420]  to get him in there and uh... and so
[1:55:14.420 --> 1:55:18.420]  uh... over the years uh... it has become so obvious and
[1:55:18.420 --> 1:55:23.060]  of course uh... uh... sunday that is many of sixty five percent of the american
[1:55:23.060 --> 1:55:26.980]  people don't even go to vote anymore because it's a waste of time
[1:55:26.980 --> 1:55:30.660]  and uh... it doesn't count the founders
[1:55:30.660 --> 1:55:36.420]  they look back in history and under magna carta and england and they
[1:55:36.420 --> 1:55:40.100]  recognize that the grand jury was a
[1:55:40.100 --> 1:55:44.900]  a key factor in maintaining and honest and
[1:55:44.900 --> 1:55:50.020]  uh... government that uh... was uh... you know uh... clean and uh... had
[1:55:50.020 --> 1:55:54.100]  integrity and all of that they recognized also
[1:55:54.100 --> 1:56:00.660]  that the power of the jury uh... a twelve person jury if you have one person
[1:56:00.660 --> 1:56:05.380]  on that jury that know how much power they have
[1:56:05.380 --> 1:56:10.260]  and they protect their own power they can hang that jury
[1:56:10.260 --> 1:56:14.820]  and of course uh... in many many cases we've had many cases where one person
[1:56:14.820 --> 1:56:19.940]  on the jury knew about their power and they educate the other eleven
[1:56:19.940 --> 1:56:23.860]  when they're in in the deliberation but the judge is
[1:56:23.860 --> 1:56:27.540]  discriminating against people that know their rights and try to keep them off
[1:56:27.540 --> 1:56:30.820]  yeah people got to keep their mouth shut till they're seated
[1:56:30.820 --> 1:56:34.980]  and this is a key underbelly of the enemy to go out and educate people
[1:56:34.980 --> 1:56:38.820]  about the power of the jury the grand jury and then of course there's the
[1:56:38.820 --> 1:56:42.420]  fourth way to vote the cartridge box but we don't want to do that
[1:56:42.420 --> 1:56:47.300]  we we want that cartridge box available
[1:56:47.300 --> 1:56:52.820]  it needs to be available at all times that they taunt i like that word
[1:56:52.820 --> 1:56:57.220]  uh... because it fits our situation uh... when we come back i want to tell
[1:56:57.220 --> 1:57:02.740]  you a story about i used to small and uh... something that happened
[1:57:02.740 --> 1:57:06.580]  back about nineteen eighty four and uh...
[1:57:06.580 --> 1:57:10.580]  uh... i think that uh... uh... people just do not
[1:57:10.580 --> 1:57:18.420]  realize how close we were uh... to being taken over by the new world order
[1:57:18.420 --> 1:57:22.260]  uh... i will tell that story when we come back and then calls it after but in
[1:57:22.260 --> 1:57:25.620]  the minute and a half we've got left plug your walls and uh...

[1:57:28.980 --> 1:57:33.220]  well uh... i'm sure that the people in other hundreds of people that got that
[1:57:33.220 --> 1:57:37.300]  the last time i was on uh... they need another book because they've already
[1:57:37.300 --> 1:57:41.140]  given that book or or lost track of it it went someplace

[2:02:12.100 --> 2:02:17.300]  and uh... you can take 20 minutes and uh... and of course uh... eustis mollins
[2:02:17.300 --> 2:02:20.260]  was there and give him 20 minutes and give
[2:02:20.260 --> 2:02:24.580]  ron paul 20 minutes and so we did and we had a really a
[2:02:24.580 --> 2:02:30.900]  uh... a real good crowd there and and uh... i took the 20 minutes and uh...
[2:02:30.900 --> 2:02:35.220]  well i think i had uh... congressman ron paul went first i think and then
[2:02:35.220 --> 2:02:38.980]  eustis mollins and then uh... i took it and uh...
[2:02:38.980 --> 2:02:43.140]  i opened it up for questions and ron or uh...
[2:02:43.140 --> 2:02:47.140]  eustis mollins had talked about the new world order
[2:02:47.140 --> 2:02:50.180]  eighty nineteen eighty four there weren't many people talking about new
[2:02:50.180 --> 2:02:53.300]  world order they didn't know what it was
[2:02:53.300 --> 2:02:58.180]  and uh... and so uh... a lady asked from the audience
[2:02:58.180 --> 2:03:02.740]  she asked eustis mollins she said uh... when do you think this is going to
[2:03:02.740 --> 2:03:06.740]  happen that uh... the new world order will take over
[2:03:06.740 --> 2:03:10.900]  and uh... and eustis says oh it's already happened
[2:03:10.900 --> 2:03:15.700]  this is about 1984 and if you will look back
[2:03:15.700 --> 2:03:20.980]  at our history that we have made since that time
[2:03:20.980 --> 2:03:25.700]  you can see the footprint of the Rothschilds and and the
[2:03:25.700 --> 2:03:29.380]  the uh... you know the federal reserve bank and all
[2:03:29.380 --> 2:03:32.740]  you can see them in everything that has happened
[2:03:32.740 --> 2:03:36.420]  America has been turned into a pure engine of the new world order
[2:03:36.420 --> 2:03:41.620]  absolutely and and eustis mollins understood that
[2:03:41.620 --> 2:03:47.940]  he had identified it and uh... he explained himself explained what he's
[2:03:47.940 --> 2:03:51.860]  thinking was very well and i don't think there was anybody there
[2:03:51.860 --> 2:03:57.460]  that didn't recognize that uh... what he was saying was 100 percent correct
[2:03:57.460 --> 2:04:00.900]  well i think it's important to recognize they took over
[2:04:00.900 --> 2:04:06.340]  as revolutionaries we're restorationists kicking the hijackers out
[2:04:06.340 --> 2:04:10.900]  yeah well there's one thing that we need to uh... stress to uh...
[2:04:10.900 --> 2:04:14.500]  alex uh... we have people in the in the uh...
[2:04:14.500 --> 2:04:18.500]  ron paul revolution and the uh... tea party people and all and they're

[2:04:23.380 --> 2:04:26.500]  the second american revolution started
[2:04:26.500 --> 2:04:32.100]  uh... when the ink wasn't even dry when the founders signed the constitution
[2:04:32.100 --> 2:04:36.420]  there were explain that to people yeah absolutely when we come back and we're going to calls

[2:05:04.180 --> 2:05:08.340]  power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[2:05:08.340 --> 2:05:12.580]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[2:05:12.580 --> 2:05:15.300]  much power your electric company allows you to have
[2:05:15.300 --> 2:05:19.460]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[2:05:19.460 --> 2:05:24.020]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[2:05:24.020 --> 2:05:27.620]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[2:05:27.620 --> 2:05:31.460]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[2:05:31.460 --> 2:05:35.060]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power
[2:05:35.060 --> 2:05:38.900]  from weather-related onages number five a solar power generator provides

[2:08:20.340 --> 2:08:24.740]  to start getting to your phone calls uh with our guests but red you were trying
[2:08:24.740 --> 2:08:30.340]  to make a point uh as we went to break about
[2:08:30.340 --> 2:08:33.940]  the fact that we're calling this the second american revolution
[2:08:33.940 --> 2:08:39.300]  i say the answer to 1984 is the spirit of 1776
[2:08:39.300 --> 2:08:43.300]  but in truth we are the restorationists we are the lawful government
[2:08:43.300 --> 2:08:47.460]  we're the good guys a bunch of offshore banks robbing us of trillions of
[2:08:47.460 --> 2:08:51.220]  dollars and setting up a police state they're the bad guys they're the
[2:08:51.220 --> 2:08:56.020]  revolutionaries go ahead well i if if we're in a revolution
[2:08:56.020 --> 2:09:00.660]  it's the third uh revolution which uh is uh
[2:09:00.660 --> 2:09:04.980]  going to restore our lawful government in this country
[2:09:04.980 --> 2:09:09.380]  uh because uh the second american revolution started right
[2:09:09.380 --> 2:09:13.940]  the very beginning because we had some of those people back there in that
[2:09:13.940 --> 2:09:17.300]  generation who also thought that they were
[2:09:17.300 --> 2:09:23.540]  uh smart enough to where they could rule uh and the rest of us uh would be
[2:09:23.540 --> 2:09:27.860]  their servants and um and so through subversion
[2:09:27.860 --> 2:09:32.900]  and it it comes down you can trace it all the way down through our history
[2:09:32.900 --> 2:09:38.660]  uh the civil war was an absolute uh atrocity that was perpetrated by some
[2:09:38.660 --> 2:09:44.900]  of these uh uh so-called very wise people smart people
[2:09:44.900 --> 2:09:48.340]  and it's on record that the Rothschilds and the british
[2:09:48.340 --> 2:09:52.500]  i mean it's mainline history manipulated both sides to have the war
[2:09:52.500 --> 2:09:56.740]  there wasn't a good side or a bad side it was all manipulated to try to break the
[2:09:56.740 --> 2:10:00.500]  country up right and and uh and you can see it
[2:10:00.500 --> 2:10:03.780]  then and of course as you come down through history
[2:10:03.780 --> 2:10:07.700]  uh you can see that tremendous influx of
[2:10:07.700 --> 2:10:13.220]  of uh european uh west european immigrants coming into this country
[2:10:13.220 --> 2:10:20.820]  uh starting about 1880 for sure and uh continuing on until about 1910 or
[2:10:20.820 --> 2:10:25.460]  1920 uh 30 some odd million they figure came
[2:10:25.460 --> 2:10:29.300]  and of course uh they didn't learn the language that quick they learned it
[2:10:29.300 --> 2:10:35.460]  and they became great americans uh but uh they were so easily manipulated and
[2:10:35.460 --> 2:10:41.220]  of course uh like i said earlier we got the uh income tax and the
[2:10:41.220 --> 2:10:47.460]  17th amendment of course and we got uh the federal reserve bank in 1913
[2:10:47.460 --> 2:10:50.900]  that's right most of the first americans really wanted to get away from
[2:10:50.900 --> 2:10:53.060]  tyranny that didn't mean they were angels or
[2:10:53.060 --> 2:10:57.460]  perfect but they were pretty pretty street smart wise and sly
[2:10:57.460 --> 2:11:01.380]  but you get a bunch of people say from germany hardworking great people
[2:11:01.380 --> 2:11:05.940]  they were property of their local lord you had the hessians who were military
[2:11:05.940 --> 2:11:09.620]  slaves you know they don't teach that in school because supposedly only blacks
[2:11:09.620 --> 2:11:13.540]  were indentured sermons or slaves at the complete fraud you had other people
[2:11:13.540 --> 2:11:16.500]  from poland people from france
[2:11:16.500 --> 2:11:21.220]  where they were under napoleonic law of the government is god
[2:11:21.220 --> 2:11:25.780]  and so they got here and didn't understand and now we've got people from
[2:11:25.780 --> 2:11:29.940]  mexico and asia and other places with no history of
[2:11:29.940 --> 2:11:32.580]  freedom and and red have you noticed the government's
[2:11:32.580 --> 2:11:36.660]  hiring all these illegals to be the military and the police
[2:11:36.660 --> 2:11:43.780]  and and to be the cps workers absolutely and uh it's all according to their plan
[2:11:43.780 --> 2:11:47.620]  and uh here's the thing that i have said i've had the
[2:11:47.620 --> 2:11:51.060]  so many people calling me over the years and and just so
[2:11:51.060 --> 2:11:55.540]  uh concerned as they oh they're going to bring in the foreign troops
[2:11:55.540 --> 2:11:59.620]  and uh and there might be a certain amount of that but
[2:11:59.620 --> 2:12:05.460]  you see that's where we uh we reached these people these foreign troops when
[2:12:05.460 --> 2:12:10.820]  they come in and they they are going to be absolutely amazed at what we have in
[2:12:10.820 --> 2:12:14.500]  this country no instead they're incrementally
[2:12:14.500 --> 2:12:18.020]  well instead and hold on a second i want to add this
[2:12:18.020 --> 2:12:21.540]  they're incrementally having drills with foreign troops having foreign troops
[2:12:21.540 --> 2:12:25.940]  help run the command and control but no they're recruiting the boys scouts
[2:12:25.940 --> 2:12:29.220]  to be the paramilitary they're militarizing the police
[2:12:29.220 --> 2:12:32.980]  they're bringing in the immigrants and making them our police in our military
[2:12:32.980 --> 2:12:36.420]  they don't need to bring in a foreign force they're turning the force
[2:12:36.420 --> 2:12:41.700]  into a foreign force yeah well the thing is we have to we have to inform those
[2:12:41.700 --> 2:12:45.540]  people and and uh they'll come over and they'll be
[2:12:45.540 --> 2:12:48.900]  on our side in fact that happened in the revolutionary
[2:12:48.900 --> 2:12:52.100]  war i know you know this but tell folks about the germans
[2:12:52.100 --> 2:12:56.580]  defecting in mass to our side oh there was a tremendous number of them they
[2:12:56.580 --> 2:13:01.540]  they were um um the uh english of course they
[2:13:01.540 --> 2:13:06.820]  hired the hessians uh they were uh german troops
[2:13:06.820 --> 2:13:11.220]  and uh of course they're the ones that they were the victims of george
[2:13:11.220 --> 2:13:15.220]  washington and trenton the famous crossing of the
[2:13:15.220 --> 2:13:18.100]  delaware river i think it was the delaware apartment
[2:13:18.100 --> 2:13:23.060]  it was trenton yes it was it was trent yeah and uh and and of course uh
[2:13:23.060 --> 2:13:30.180]  uh i just think that um i it doesn't take a brain surgeon to figure out how
[2:13:30.180 --> 2:13:36.180]  corrupt our government is and as long as we're able to speak and as
[2:13:36.180 --> 2:13:40.660]  long as we have our our written materials out there and such
[2:13:40.660 --> 2:13:44.500]  uh the whole world is watching us now
[2:13:44.500 --> 2:13:50.500]  they're watching us very close and um i think that we've got more
[2:13:50.500 --> 2:13:54.900]  uh people out there in the other countries of the world
[2:13:54.900 --> 2:14:01.300]  that are uh cheering us on they're all for us so i know i recognize
[2:14:01.300 --> 2:14:06.580]  they recognize that we have something here that they would all like to have
[2:14:06.580 --> 2:14:11.140]  and uh they don't they don't uh you know they
[2:14:11.140 --> 2:14:15.060]  they don't like the central banks the central banks are in trouble all over
[2:14:15.060 --> 2:14:19.780]  this world today yes and so um you know the euro isn't
[2:14:19.780 --> 2:14:23.380]  doing all that great uh the dollar the only thing that's holding up the dollar
[2:14:23.380 --> 2:14:25.460]  at this point is the fact that the euro is
[2:14:25.460 --> 2:14:29.940]  having a problem well red think how far we've come
[2:14:29.940 --> 2:14:35.060]  where 20 years ago the media said Rothschilds don't exist
[2:14:35.060 --> 2:14:38.180]  trilateral commission doesn't exist we're not joking
[2:14:38.180 --> 2:14:42.820]  Bilderberg group doesn't exist the federal reserve isn't private
[2:14:42.820 --> 2:14:46.100]  and now they go okay it's all real what's the big deal
[2:14:46.100 --> 2:14:50.100]  i want to go to phone calls but coming up i want to get into your book why the
[2:14:50.100 --> 2:14:53.780]  militia with an encapsulation of what the militia really is
[2:14:53.780 --> 2:14:58.180]  how do you stop infiltration provocateur false flag setups
[2:14:58.180 --> 2:15:01.700]  and the enemy racing to put their cashless grid in
[2:15:01.700 --> 2:15:05.860]  and so how getting back to rural communities being self-sufficient
[2:15:05.860 --> 2:15:09.940]  will defeat the enemy it's like a cancer it can only come into a certain
[2:15:09.940 --> 2:15:13.460]  or it it's like something with a rundown immune system
[2:15:13.460 --> 2:15:16.100]  uh so we're going to talk about that as well but are you ready to go to calls

[2:18:38.020 --> 2:18:42.180]  they are going to quote ban criticism of the government on the web i mean
[2:18:42.180 --> 2:18:46.100]  they're openly saying it and it's in a few newspapers but not that big of a
[2:18:46.100 --> 2:18:51.700]  deal i guess uh you know uh it's kind of a compliment
[2:18:51.700 --> 2:18:55.540]  uh when they talk about that you know that we're
[2:18:55.540 --> 2:19:00.660]  very very effective and they they're they're they're concerned
[2:19:00.660 --> 2:19:05.540]  because uh people we've got the truth and they've got the law
[2:19:05.540 --> 2:19:11.060]  and and the lie always comes in second when the truth is there when the truth
[2:19:11.060 --> 2:19:15.620]  is exposed and so uh when they talk about doing
[2:19:15.620 --> 2:19:18.980]  something about the internet it tells you how worried they are
[2:19:18.980 --> 2:19:23.780]  about the truth that's coming out they're scared to death

[2:21:15.940 --> 2:21:19.140]  americans at home. I've turned a tremendous influence
[2:21:19.140 --> 2:21:23.540]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots. I think
[2:21:23.540 --> 2:21:27.780]  it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay
[2:21:27.780 --> 2:21:30.420]  attention. Full of the republic identifies the
[2:21:30.420 --> 2:21:33.860]  enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[2:21:33.860 --> 2:21:38.020]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[2:21:38.020 --> 2:21:42.340]  government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and arsonists they're asking for more matches
[2:21:42.340 --> 2:21:45.780]  and the congress is saying who do we make the checkout to. Today seems like
[2:21:45.780 --> 2:21:49.220]  nobody does care and right now in washington dc

[2:24:51.700 --> 2:24:54.660]  on the air thanks for holding
[2:24:54.660 --> 2:25:01.540]  hey alex and red welcome hi um i have a question in regard to lawful
[2:25:01.540 --> 2:25:05.060]  government uh red do americans still have a
[2:25:05.060 --> 2:25:08.260]  true to your government or a criminal de facto
[2:25:08.260 --> 2:25:11.860]  offshore banking cartel posing as our government
[2:25:11.860 --> 2:25:18.660]  called the united states of america well the government that we have in
[2:25:18.660 --> 2:25:22.900]  washington dc uh... it is uh...
[2:25:22.900 --> 2:25:27.540]  it is not it is not the government that we had
[2:25:27.540 --> 2:25:32.340]  uh... when the constitution uh... it isn't the government that was created
[2:25:32.340 --> 2:25:37.300]  by the constitution and of course i don't get into that too
[2:25:37.300 --> 2:25:43.540]  much because it is uh... a very evil system the way it is today
[2:25:43.540 --> 2:25:48.500]  but where you see i i say we the people have to take the blame
[2:25:48.500 --> 2:25:52.580]  for it and that's where we have to start making the correction
[2:25:52.580 --> 2:25:58.740]  uh... it is we the people who let this bunch of outlaws
[2:25:58.740 --> 2:26:04.580]  get control of our system and we are the ones that have to take it back if we
[2:26:04.580 --> 2:26:07.460]  want to be free if we want liberty and freedom
[2:26:07.460 --> 2:26:10.580]  we're going to have to take our power back
[2:26:10.580 --> 2:26:14.500]  i you know they taught us about the separation of powers and
[2:26:14.500 --> 2:26:18.580]  in our high school uh... government classes uh...
[2:26:18.580 --> 2:26:22.020]  and uh... they talked about the separation of powers between the
[2:26:22.020 --> 2:26:25.380]  legislative executive and judicial branches of government
[2:26:25.380 --> 2:26:29.940]  they never said a word about the power of the individual
[2:26:29.940 --> 2:26:34.900]  they didn't say anything about my power that i have and your power
[2:26:34.900 --> 2:26:40.020]  they told us that the legislative and executive branch in the judicial branch
[2:26:40.020 --> 2:26:44.580]  they were to jealously guard their powers
[2:26:44.580 --> 2:26:48.900]  as no enumerated in the constitution
[2:26:48.900 --> 2:26:53.540]  well you and i we were never taught how to
[2:26:53.540 --> 2:26:57.860]  jealously protect our powers as individuals
[2:26:57.860 --> 2:27:01.860]  read here's a question the supreme court ruling as i
[2:27:01.860 --> 2:27:05.700]  read it says that offshore private corporations
[2:27:05.700 --> 2:27:09.620]  can give unlimited money but still individuals are barred down to three
[2:27:09.620 --> 2:27:13.460]  thousand per candidate and so what they've done is they've bound
[2:27:13.460 --> 2:27:18.900]  the individual while unleashing the tyrannical
[2:27:18.900 --> 2:27:23.380]  foreign corporations so again more signs of their desperation
[2:27:23.380 --> 2:27:29.140]  yes uh... you know i i think that that's great that the
[2:27:29.140 --> 2:27:34.660]  that the supreme court made that ruling uh... because it got a lot of people's
[2:27:34.660 --> 2:27:39.060]  attention and uh... and that's what we need is people that
[2:27:39.060 --> 2:27:43.780]  uh... all of a sudden they get hit with something like this and they say my
[2:27:43.780 --> 2:27:48.340]  goodness how could this happen and so they start searching and they start
[2:27:48.340 --> 2:27:53.780]  listening to alex jones and others and and they get an education
[2:27:53.780 --> 2:27:59.380]  and uh... so uh... and of course uh... the tea party people
[2:27:59.380 --> 2:28:06.340]  if uh... and and and the the power out there uh... amongst the people that on
[2:28:06.340 --> 2:28:10.660]  our side you know that understand where we're at
[2:28:10.660 --> 2:28:16.260]  the power that they have is so fabulous if they use it properly
[2:28:16.260 --> 2:28:19.540]  and that is you see they've got to start
[2:28:19.540 --> 2:28:24.340]  identifying all of the four hundred thirty five members of the house
[2:28:24.340 --> 2:28:28.260]  they have to run for reelection or somebody else will take their their
[2:28:28.260 --> 2:28:32.500]  seat in the congress what we need to do is
[2:28:32.500 --> 2:28:36.340]  identify in each legislative district
[2:28:36.340 --> 2:28:39.940]  we have to identify the incumbent
[2:28:39.940 --> 2:28:45.220]  is he a carl marx democrat or is he a carl marx republican
[2:28:45.220 --> 2:28:48.980]  uh... you see carl marx democrats and carl marx
[2:28:48.980 --> 2:28:53.540]  uh... republicans are easy to identify because they want gun control
[2:28:53.540 --> 2:28:59.780]  and let me go further here the spin with this ruling is all the government
[2:28:59.780 --> 2:29:04.980]  mccain feingold wouldn't let's a corporation fund a hillary movie
[2:29:04.980 --> 2:29:08.420]  now they would have limitedly said yeah corporations can make their own
[2:29:08.420 --> 2:29:11.940]  movies no they didn't say that they said
[2:29:11.940 --> 2:29:15.460]  okay unlimited for the corporations but the citizens are bound
[2:29:15.460 --> 2:29:19.780]  and again that shows how the tea parties are even fooled by this it
[2:29:19.780 --> 2:29:24.500]  at least currently some of them thinking oh this was a free speech move no
[2:29:24.500 --> 2:29:28.100]  again it's more deception but i appreciate your call nick we're gonna
[2:29:28.100 --> 2:29:31.700]  hurry through calls now mark karen kenneth

[2:36:53.060 --> 2:36:57.940]  it's in the middle of rights it's what the posse is it's what civil defense is
[2:36:57.940 --> 2:37:01.140]  and i try to explain to them but the government provocateurs groups to
[2:37:01.140 --> 2:37:04.820]  demonize it and i try to break that down but i want to

[2:37:12.260 --> 2:37:15.780]  backman ah god bless you sir ever in our prayers
[2:37:15.780 --> 2:37:19.380]  uh can you hear me okay yes i can okay item one
[2:37:19.380 --> 2:37:23.300]  i would like to see about i understand you get annoyed about people who want
[2:37:23.300 --> 2:37:26.980]  you to do more like you haven't given your hat and your coat and everything to
[2:37:26.980 --> 2:37:30.340]  this cause i would like to see about getting a
[2:37:30.340 --> 2:37:35.380]  crew of volunteers to help you deal with all the massive emails you get i'd
[2:37:35.380 --> 2:37:38.740]  like to see about helping getting people together
[2:37:38.740 --> 2:37:42.180]  to say we'd like to help you sort through all this massive amount of
[2:37:42.180 --> 2:37:45.700]  incoming information and help you answer all the questions that people are
[2:37:45.700 --> 2:37:49.060]  asking what i'd like to see uh let me
[2:37:49.060 --> 2:37:54.580]  very briefly outline of video production i'd like to have called we the jury
[2:37:54.580 --> 2:37:57.540]  where we have the it's just like pilgrims progress you can tell the
[2:37:57.540 --> 2:38:01.380]  characters by their names pat riot and go figure he's patriot
[2:38:01.380 --> 2:38:05.300]  and he's dying of depleted uranium and because you have a character that looks
[2:38:05.300 --> 2:38:09.540]  a lot like lawn or uchi and go who the guy who murdered sarah weaver at ruby
[2:38:09.540 --> 2:38:13.620]  ridge and pat writing to everyone nobody's doing anything
[2:38:13.620 --> 2:38:16.820]  and pat takes actions that will suffice to say
[2:38:16.820 --> 2:38:20.180]  would not be called for in a lawful government
[2:38:20.180 --> 2:38:24.900]  that was doing what was right but then if that were the case and
[2:38:24.900 --> 2:38:28.100]  then lawn would never have dared murder sarah weaver
[2:38:28.100 --> 2:38:31.060]  and they will hold on just a minute hold on just a minute mark i'm going to put
[2:38:31.060 --> 2:38:34.020]  you on hold for a minute here's the deal
[2:38:34.020 --> 2:38:38.340]  it isn't that i don't like people giving me ideas and it isn't that i don't like
[2:38:38.340 --> 2:38:42.260]  people telling me i need to do this or do that it's that
[2:38:42.260 --> 2:38:46.820]  you know take uh people caught like ron paul's asked me to come speak at big
[2:38:46.820 --> 2:38:50.660]  events and i just don't have the time because i can electronically reach 10
[2:38:50.660 --> 2:38:54.260]  times as many people in the time it would take to drive to houston
[2:38:54.260 --> 2:38:58.100]  um and then when i do show up at events they have provocateurs that try to
[2:38:58.100 --> 2:39:02.180]  stir stuff up and create a distraction i mean it's literally by the book this
[2:39:02.180 --> 2:39:05.380]  so maybe i should be out of more events because the system doesn't like it
[2:39:05.380 --> 2:39:10.180]  also uh you know there have been like let's say
[2:39:10.180 --> 2:39:13.140]  jordan maxwell keeps begging me to come make a film
[2:39:13.140 --> 2:39:17.300]  with his material i'd love to i i can't even get my own films done
[2:39:17.300 --> 2:39:24.100]  um again we're lean and mean and i'm not saying you're bad mark but if i let
[2:39:24.100 --> 2:39:28.020]  20 people in my office guaranteed five of them will be feds and they'd be
[2:39:28.020 --> 2:39:31.540]  trying to put me in prison within hours and and and again i don't talk a lot
[2:39:31.540 --> 2:39:36.100]  about this but we're under attack and you know just like red said it's good
[2:39:36.100 --> 2:39:40.500]  to have thousands of little groups out there educating others
[2:39:40.500 --> 2:39:45.860]  because that's invincible big organizations with one big giant head
[2:39:45.860 --> 2:39:49.460]  are too easy to shoot down i'd rather have a thousand
[2:39:49.460 --> 2:39:52.580]  torpedo boats going up against an enemy fleet
[2:39:52.580 --> 2:39:56.900]  than one aircraft carrier red beckman i mean uh do you agree with what i'm
[2:39:56.900 --> 2:40:01.140]  saying absolutely absolutely
[2:40:01.140 --> 2:40:05.380]  i mean any comments on your experiences dealing with provocateurs and stuff
[2:40:05.380 --> 2:40:12.420]  well i've been able to um identify a number of them over the years
[2:40:12.420 --> 2:40:18.820]  and uh it they're not too hard to spot after a bit
[2:40:18.820 --> 2:40:23.380]  they'll try to ingratiate themselves with you and one thing another and
[2:40:23.380 --> 2:40:28.820]  uh they even may spend some money for books and things like that but
[2:40:28.820 --> 2:40:34.900]  they will invariably end up trying to tell you and get you motivated to do
[2:40:34.900 --> 2:40:38.820]  something that would be a violation of law
[2:40:38.820 --> 2:40:46.100]  and so uh if you uh have somebody come in and try to be nicey nice and um
[2:40:46.100 --> 2:40:49.860]  and the first thing you know they're telling you that they ought to do this
[2:40:49.860 --> 2:40:54.100]  or do that uh or they use the credibility of being
[2:40:54.100 --> 2:40:58.260]  within your operation to go tell people you're talking bad about them when
[2:40:58.260 --> 2:41:00.980]  you're not just to start in fighting you know
[2:41:00.980 --> 2:41:04.420]  well it's uh they're there and and of course
[2:41:04.420 --> 2:41:08.180]  having all of these thousands of different organizations
[2:41:08.180 --> 2:41:12.660]  um you know i in montana i i still have a
[2:41:12.660 --> 2:41:16.100]  a footprint there and i i told the people there i said
[2:41:16.100 --> 2:41:20.180]  every organization have a different pick a different name
[2:41:20.180 --> 2:41:23.460]  and uh and one of them uh they call themselves
[2:41:23.460 --> 2:41:31.700]  montana uh oh my goodness uh a senior moment
[2:41:31.700 --> 2:41:37.060]  uh for man ryan's book uh atlas shrugged they call themselves montana
[2:41:37.060 --> 2:41:42.500]  shrugged and they have hundreds hundreds of people
[2:41:42.500 --> 2:41:45.700]  in their organization they have they're all
[2:41:45.700 --> 2:41:50.420]  uh put together or connected uh electronically
[2:41:50.420 --> 2:41:55.140]  and uh and what a what a name oh at a montana shrugged
[2:41:55.140 --> 2:41:59.140]  and then they're connected to other groups and it's it's a
[2:41:59.140 --> 2:42:02.900]  headless system to where the enemy can't defeat it but but but mark
[2:42:02.900 --> 2:42:06.180]  write up your ideas send it to us at info wars
[2:42:06.180 --> 2:42:09.860]  dot com it would be great to be able to go through all the tips all the stuff we
[2:42:09.860 --> 2:42:14.100]  miss all the things we do it's just that i also want to encourage listeners
[2:42:14.100 --> 2:42:18.180]  to not wish you could work for me or wish you could work with us or wish you
[2:42:18.180 --> 2:42:21.700]  could you're out there as leaders start your own organization if you believe in
[2:42:21.700 --> 2:42:25.540]  our information post it share it i mean
[2:42:25.540 --> 2:42:28.900]  again we're about getting you to take action
[2:42:28.900 --> 2:42:33.300]  not for us to then go do more because i really physically can't do
[2:42:33.300 --> 2:42:37.940]  much more except work smarter and launch new electronic operations against the
[2:42:37.940 --> 2:42:41.460]  enemy to spread our information more and it's you the listeners that make that
[2:42:41.460 --> 2:42:47.380]  so effective let's go to caron in oregon caron you're on the air
[2:42:47.380 --> 2:42:50.980]  thank you very much for all you do for the patriot movement
[2:42:50.980 --> 2:42:54.820]  the other day i was listening to you and microbarrow mentioned the national
[2:42:54.820 --> 2:42:58.580]  strike well i am hoping to put that together and our goals
[2:42:58.580 --> 2:43:02.100]  are no global government restore our constitution
[2:43:02.100 --> 2:43:06.500]  individual sovereignty state sovereignty limited federal government
[2:43:06.500 --> 2:43:10.340]  no more voting machines or taxation without representation
[2:43:10.340 --> 2:43:14.900]  what we are trying to do here is unite all of the fractionated groups all
[2:43:14.900 --> 2:43:19.300]  across this great country and have them get on the freedom train
[2:43:19.300 --> 2:43:24.340]  and totally economically withdraw and support this national strike
[2:43:24.340 --> 2:43:28.980]  april 15th through april 18th can you endorse this
[2:43:28.980 --> 2:43:32.180]  well i have endorsed i've said people on the 15th
[2:43:32.180 --> 2:43:36.420]  should not just have a strike against the new world order they should call
[2:43:36.420 --> 2:43:40.260]  the local media and tell them a strike's being organized in austin or
[2:43:40.260 --> 2:43:45.300]  dallas or new york or or portland or wherever it is and have everybody
[2:43:45.300 --> 2:43:48.500]  calling to talk radio send letters to the editor
[2:43:48.500 --> 2:43:53.060]  have protest on that day as well and we don't need to have one big centralized
[2:43:53.060 --> 2:43:57.220]  organized hub but yes i do support a national
[2:43:57.220 --> 2:44:01.380]  demonstration and strike on the 15th through the 18th
[2:44:01.380 --> 2:44:04.820]  i think people have just been saying the 15th but whatever uh red beckman i
[2:44:04.820 --> 2:44:07.300]  appreciate your call caron red beckman
[2:44:07.300 --> 2:44:11.540]  yes i i think that uh... uh... that is going to be
[2:44:11.540 --> 2:44:17.540]  uh... all landmark in uh... uh... you know american history i think it's
[2:44:17.540 --> 2:44:22.100]  going to happen uh... i think it's going to be big big big
[2:44:22.100 --> 2:44:25.300]  and uh... i was just looking through uh...
[2:44:25.300 --> 2:44:28.900]  uh... the uh... book uh... why the militia
[2:44:28.900 --> 2:44:32.020]  and i had some comments in here about the press
[2:44:32.020 --> 2:44:36.260]  and uh... we're talking about you we were talking about the supreme court
[2:44:36.260 --> 2:44:40.100]  decision letting uh... current corporations uh...
[2:44:40.100 --> 2:44:45.380]  spend money for uh... campaign well you know they're going to be wasting their
[2:44:45.380 --> 2:44:50.020]  money because people are not very dependent anymore
[2:44:50.020 --> 2:44:53.860]  on major media and uh... i had a comment
[2:44:53.860 --> 2:44:57.860]  uh... two or three of me in the middle when i had a chapter on the media
[2:44:57.860 --> 2:45:01.300]  i said if you believe without question what you see in here
[2:45:01.300 --> 2:45:04.980]  coming from major media you are an exhibit
[2:45:04.980 --> 2:45:08.100]  proving that propaganda and lies can inflict
[2:45:08.100 --> 2:45:13.940]  serious brain damage and then another one major media personalities live for a
[2:45:13.940 --> 2:45:17.780]  living seven figure incomes can cause a person to
[2:45:17.780 --> 2:45:22.980]  misplace his conscience and then one most of the millions spent
[2:45:22.980 --> 2:45:27.300]  during political campaigns end up in the pockets of the media
[2:45:27.300 --> 2:45:32.500]  the media get the money and the people get a choice between two evils
[2:45:32.500 --> 2:45:39.380]  those days are over for the big uh... money to come in and buy an election
[2:45:39.380 --> 2:45:44.980]  because the newspapers the media the television media and such
[2:45:44.980 --> 2:45:49.300]  they're uh... uh... they're panicking because
[2:45:49.300 --> 2:45:53.380]  the newspapers how many newspapers have gone bankrupt
[2:45:53.380 --> 2:45:57.540]  and you're going to hear about major media tv and such that
[2:45:57.540 --> 2:46:01.140]  they're going to be going bankrupt too and uh...
[2:46:01.140 --> 2:46:04.740]  people don't but they're just not relying on
[2:46:04.740 --> 2:46:08.900]  those media for their information and so
[2:46:08.900 --> 2:46:12.740]  let them corporations those foreign corporations come in and spend their
[2:46:12.740 --> 2:46:18.580]  money with the media and uh... and we'll just thumb our nose at the media
[2:46:18.580 --> 2:46:23.940]  well that's right and i appreciate your call ma'am uh...
[2:46:23.940 --> 2:46:27.460]  this the globalist are dead on arrival they're going to get their role
[2:46:27.460 --> 2:46:31.060]  government but it's going to die the day it's finally established
[2:46:31.060 --> 2:46:35.300]  because humanity doesn't want to be slaves and they want to use poverty and
[2:46:35.300 --> 2:46:38.660]  degradation to control us but it's just not going to work forever
[2:46:38.660 --> 2:46:42.020]  and the mainstream media isn't just dying because of the internet
[2:46:42.020 --> 2:46:45.220]  they are clearly dying in all the polls and studies
[2:46:45.220 --> 2:46:48.340]  because people know they're a pack of spinning twisting
[2:46:48.340 --> 2:46:51.620]  deceiving liars
[2:46:52.820 --> 2:46:56.420]  let's go back to the phone calls let's talk to kenneth in texas kenneth go
[2:46:56.420 --> 2:46:57.460]  ahead
[2:46:57.460 --> 2:47:01.060]  hi alex thank you for taking my call i know you're trying to get a lot of calls so i'll go ahead and
[2:47:01.060 --> 2:47:04.660]  make this brief uh... i heard yelp talking earlier about how uh... the germans
[2:47:04.660 --> 2:47:07.700]  were defecting during the revolutionary war i believe it was
[2:47:07.700 --> 2:47:11.300]  and uh... i wanted to highlight back in the late 90s
[2:47:11.300 --> 2:47:14.500]  when act members of the n-w-o were defecting
[2:47:14.500 --> 2:47:17.060]  and i think we should kind of get a movement like that going again
[2:47:17.060 --> 2:47:22.820]  by bringing back the n-w-o wolf pack where kevin nash and lex luger
[2:47:22.820 --> 2:47:27.940]  and all of them left the n-w-o i appreciate your call
[2:47:27.940 --> 2:47:32.340]  that's that's very funny he's talking about i guess holcogan or something
[2:47:32.340 --> 2:47:36.340]  um... let's uh... go ahead now and talk to
[2:47:36.340 --> 2:47:44.020]  uh... calio i believe or calo from hawaii you're on the air go ahead

[2:47:49.940 --> 2:47:53.380]  blessing for us here in hawaii um...
[2:47:53.380 --> 2:47:57.140]  and the indirectly also been a very blessing for the hawaiian sovereignty
[2:47:57.140 --> 2:47:59.780]  movement because the hawaiian sovereignty movement
[2:47:59.780 --> 2:48:03.540]  had been why we've been fighting new world wars since 1893
[2:48:03.540 --> 2:48:07.700]  since the overthrow of the hawaiian kingdom by british and american businessmen so
[2:48:07.700 --> 2:48:13.220]  as we can just they came and just killed your killed your leaders and took over
[2:48:13.220 --> 2:48:17.860]  pretty much they they actually um they actually over through our marquis with
[2:48:17.860 --> 2:48:21.700]  uh... with gunboat gunboat this diplomacy
[2:48:21.700 --> 2:48:24.660]  and then actually america was supposed to be the
[2:48:24.660 --> 2:48:31.860]  supposed to be the um the protected with over 26 treaties with uh
[2:48:31.860 --> 2:48:35.300]  america as well as all the other european nations of the world
[2:48:35.300 --> 2:48:39.060]  and actually the kingdom of hawaii has a third seat in the in in the united
[2:48:39.060 --> 2:48:42.660]  nations it's never been seated since the the league of nations
[2:48:42.660 --> 2:48:46.500]  but make a long story short you and your dvds
[2:48:46.500 --> 2:48:51.620]  and uh... what you've been doing for us here is in hawaii as well as um
[2:48:51.620 --> 2:48:56.660]  as american hawaiians have been been very very very important because
[2:48:56.660 --> 2:49:00.500]  um we got some of your shirts when obama was here
[2:49:00.500 --> 2:49:03.860]  we had the joker shirts and we we kind of hid them underneath our
[2:49:03.860 --> 2:49:08.500]  all our shirts as is pretty neat as he was pulling into his complex you know
[2:49:08.500 --> 2:49:12.020]  he was smiling and we opened up the shirts and he saw it and he could see his
[2:49:12.020 --> 2:49:16.820]  face just drop you could tell you as he was really kind of she was
[2:49:16.820 --> 2:49:20.820]  a little rattled by it yeah this is somebody who can't run a scam on
[2:49:20.820 --> 2:49:24.980]  and me and you stay there because i want you to continue to comment but red
[2:49:24.980 --> 2:49:28.340]  i mean look how fast the hoax of obama has imploded
[2:49:28.340 --> 2:49:31.780]  i mean this is really shaking the system up absolutely
[2:49:31.780 --> 2:49:36.580]  uh... in some respects obama is the best thing that's happened to our country
[2:49:36.580 --> 2:49:41.940]  in a long while from hawaii anything else sir
[2:49:41.940 --> 2:49:45.380]  is it kaleo? how do i pronounce your name? kaleo?
[2:49:45.380 --> 2:49:48.820]  it's kaleo okay great go ahead sir
[2:49:48.820 --> 2:49:52.660]  yeah so you know and when he saw it and now this is his home state
[2:49:52.660 --> 2:49:55.700]  so you know seeing that people in his own home
[2:49:55.700 --> 2:49:59.540]  in his home state are hip to the deception and the lie of the new world
[2:49:59.540 --> 2:50:01.700]  order and then we realize that he's a public
[2:50:01.700 --> 2:50:05.380]  i think he had a rather rattling effect on him because i think he comes to
[2:50:05.380 --> 2:50:08.340]  right to try to get away from all of that
[2:50:08.340 --> 2:50:11.700]  and uh when he comes back here and he's confronted with that same reality
[2:50:11.700 --> 2:50:14.980]  it's almost a look in the mirror you know
[2:50:14.980 --> 2:50:18.820]  oh it's very important just to let the globalists know that we're aware of
[2:50:18.820 --> 2:50:22.020]  them and don't like them because they get off on the fact that
[2:50:22.020 --> 2:50:26.020]  they're conning us right that's absolutely right
[2:50:26.020 --> 2:50:30.420]  but i just want you to know um you know i was turned on we have a radio station

[2:54:14.580 --> 2:54:18.180]  front port i saw a story last week where wall greens wouldn't develop
[2:54:18.180 --> 2:54:21.700]  photos of a man's gun collection for his insurance
[2:54:21.700 --> 2:54:26.260]  he was supposed to take photos of your stereo computer stuff like that guns
[2:54:26.260 --> 2:54:30.340]  just the image of a gun is now evil with all the violence on tv video games
[2:54:30.340 --> 2:54:35.220]  police that's all okay but citizens with guns or the image of guns
[2:54:35.220 --> 2:54:38.660]  they're trying to make it so taboo but it's not working
[2:54:38.660 --> 2:54:44.740]  this is new york daily news laura timoni fumes after son patrick nine his
[2:54:44.740 --> 2:54:49.300]  dad's a cop is busted for bringing a two inch long toy gun
[2:54:49.300 --> 2:54:54.580]  a plastic gi joe gun for the gi joe figure
[2:54:54.580 --> 2:54:57.700]  and they're talking about kicking him out of school arresting him
[2:54:57.700 --> 2:55:01.140]  all the stuff but the good news is people aren't buying into this
[2:55:01.140 --> 2:55:05.380]  mind control just like they've demonized the militia red beckman you wrote why
[2:55:05.380 --> 2:55:08.740]  the militia explain to people what the militia
[2:55:08.740 --> 2:55:15.940]  really is is uh the people being armed
[2:55:15.940 --> 2:55:22.500]  and able to defend themselves uh from an oppressive government
[2:55:22.500 --> 2:55:27.140]  i i was just uh looking through the book here and i had a comment
[2:55:27.140 --> 2:55:31.140]  why the militia and i said for the same reasons
[2:55:31.140 --> 2:55:38.420]  we had in 1775 uh you remember the history of how the
[2:55:38.420 --> 2:55:43.300]  the the british general in boston ordered the troops to go out to lexington
[2:55:43.300 --> 2:55:48.900]  and confiscate the powder and and the shot that the
[2:55:48.900 --> 2:55:54.740]  patriots were collecting anticipating a war or a revolution whatever
[2:55:54.740 --> 2:56:00.740]  and uh there's where the shot was fired to herd around the world
[2:56:00.740 --> 2:56:05.540]  the same reasons we've got the same reasons today that we had them
[2:56:05.540 --> 2:56:08.820]  and uh... i'll tell you uh...
[2:56:08.820 --> 2:56:13.460]  and if you're not if you haven't gotten yourself armed
[2:56:13.460 --> 2:56:17.460]  my advice to you is do it and be part of this
[2:56:17.460 --> 2:56:23.300]  tremendous uh operation that we've got going in this country to restore our
[2:56:23.300 --> 2:56:27.060]  lawful government and uh... this they taught
[2:56:27.060 --> 2:56:32.740]  uh... if they hit us or if we're going to be equipped to hit them back
[2:56:32.740 --> 2:56:36.660]  and we're going to hit them back a lot harder than they hit us so
[2:56:36.660 --> 2:56:41.140]  uh they better not be playing games with their false flags and all of that
[2:56:41.140 --> 2:56:45.300]  because uh they don't know when
[2:56:45.300 --> 2:56:49.300]  they're going to go just a little too far and
[2:56:49.300 --> 2:56:55.300]  and trigger uh this reaction like we had and conquered square back there in
[2:56:55.300 --> 2:57:00.820]  april 19th of 1775 and clearly clearly that spirit is
[2:57:00.820 --> 2:57:03.380]  there because there's a lot of people
[2:57:03.380 --> 2:57:06.900]  that have a sense of desperation they're sick of it
[2:57:06.900 --> 2:57:11.380]  and they are ready and i'm telling the establishment
[2:57:11.380 --> 2:57:15.300]  that you know they see the 17 million guns that have been sold in the last
[2:57:15.300 --> 2:57:18.420]  14 months i'm telling you we're trying to
[2:57:18.420 --> 2:57:21.700]  restrain the population but there are a lot of people
[2:57:21.700 --> 2:57:25.620]  especially a lot of people above 50 veterans who just want to
[2:57:25.620 --> 2:57:31.540]  go ahead and fight and go ahead but uh the book
[2:57:31.540 --> 2:57:36.260]  uh why the militia uh explained how
[2:57:36.260 --> 2:57:40.260]  uh we can avoid having to go to that kind of
[2:57:40.260 --> 2:57:44.580]  of um uh effort to restore all the government
[2:57:44.580 --> 2:57:47.700]  uh it brings out very strong the grand jury and the
[2:57:47.700 --> 2:57:51.620]  and the pettit jury uh the trial jury and how they are to function
[2:57:51.620 --> 2:57:55.620]  uh it talks about the federal reserve bank and by the way
[2:57:55.620 --> 2:57:59.700]  when have you heard anybody talking about
[2:57:59.700 --> 2:58:02.980]  what happens to the federal reserve if we could
[2:58:02.980 --> 2:58:08.820]  abolish the federal reserve and if the assets of the federal reserve
[2:58:08.820 --> 2:58:12.340]  was restored to the treasury of the united states
[2:58:12.340 --> 2:58:16.100]  stop right there red i'm going to twist your arm for five more because you
[2:58:16.100 --> 2:58:19.220]  brought that up i want you to be able to flesh that out because remember what
[2:58:19.220 --> 2:58:23.140]  just happened in iceland they were telling the country they owed five
[2:58:23.140 --> 2:58:26.900]  times their entire wealth to the bank of england and the
[2:58:26.900 --> 2:58:31.220]  federal reserve when they had run the scam on record to rob them
[2:58:31.220 --> 2:58:35.300]  and when the public finally said no the banks went oh look
[2:58:35.300 --> 2:58:39.220]  we actually have the assets to pay this off

[3:00:45.220 --> 3:00:48.820]  be a slave and let me tell you something if i thought i fought hard
[3:00:48.820 --> 3:00:52.100]  eight years ago when i had my first child with my wife
[3:00:52.100 --> 3:00:58.020]  i began to fight even harder and fully commit myself i mean i thought i was
[3:00:58.020 --> 3:01:01.780]  fighting hard before now i'm fighting for their life i don't really care about
[3:01:01.780 --> 3:01:04.500]  my life when you've been fighting this long and
[3:01:04.500 --> 3:01:08.740]  this hard and been persecuted like i have red beckman's had his house bulldozed
[3:01:08.740 --> 3:01:11.860]  and he never even talks about all the persecution he's gone through
[3:01:11.860 --> 3:01:15.460]  you get to the point where you don't even care all that matters is justice
[3:01:15.460 --> 3:01:19.140]  red beckman finishing up here because you keep intriguing me
[3:01:19.140 --> 3:01:22.900]  you were pointing out what would happen under the comprehensive annual financial
[3:01:22.900 --> 3:01:27.620]  reports in the double set of books the bankers are fabulously wealthy
[3:01:27.620 --> 3:01:30.820]  they have more wealth than all the nations combined if we take their
[3:01:30.820 --> 3:01:34.980]  fraudulent wealth that would fix all of our problems and put dividend
[3:01:34.980 --> 3:01:39.540]  bank accounts for everybody that's how much wealth they've stolen
[3:01:39.540 --> 3:01:44.180]  uh well let me let me say this there's very few people
[3:01:44.180 --> 3:01:48.100]  uh that have understood this i explained this
[3:01:48.100 --> 3:01:54.260]  to uh uh our friend uh who just passed away
[3:01:54.260 --> 3:02:00.020]  uh back about 20 years ago and he hadn't he hadn't really comprehended this and
[3:02:00.020 --> 3:02:04.740]  he used to have written uh the book the secret of the federal reserve back in
[3:02:04.740 --> 3:02:09.780]  the early 50s but he hadn't really connected all the dots
[3:02:09.780 --> 3:02:14.660]  uh back in the 80s after nixon deregulated gold
[3:02:14.660 --> 3:02:21.380]  gold mining just blossomed and exploded worldwide and
[3:02:21.380 --> 3:02:26.180]  where was all that gold going it wasn't being bought by joe six back because he
[3:02:26.180 --> 3:02:30.500]  didn't have enough money to buy it it was being bought up by the federal
[3:02:30.500 --> 3:02:34.180]  reserve bank with those hundred dollar bills
[3:02:34.180 --> 3:02:38.340]  that they were going to the u.s printing press or the printing office and they
[3:02:38.340 --> 3:02:41.060]  were buying hundred dollar bills at that time
[3:02:41.060 --> 3:02:45.220]  and in 1984 i'm thinking of that year in particular
[3:02:45.220 --> 3:02:48.580]  they were buying hundred dollar bills for 2.6
[3:02:48.580 --> 3:02:53.060]  cents a piece how much gold would you have bought
[3:02:53.060 --> 3:02:56.820]  if you could bought hundred dollar bills for 2.6 cents a piece
[3:02:56.820 --> 3:03:03.140]  unlimited where is all that gold they used it to manipulate and drive down the
[3:03:03.140 --> 3:03:06.420]  gold market we're going to find out where it's at
[3:03:06.420 --> 3:03:10.980]  i i i'm so sure that this is coming
[3:03:10.980 --> 3:03:17.460]  i you know it's past my time when i can work on it that much but i'll
[3:03:17.460 --> 3:03:21.700]  tell you there are people out there that are working on this
[3:03:21.700 --> 3:03:26.020]  very very good quality people that are working on this
[3:03:26.020 --> 3:03:29.700]  and when we find all that gold and there's um
[3:03:29.700 --> 3:03:35.060]  there's thousands of tons of it and it is going to be
[3:03:35.060 --> 3:03:39.860]  ours and that's got to worry the system that's got to worry the system to know
[3:03:39.860 --> 3:03:42.340]  there's all these millions of investigators
[3:03:42.340 --> 3:03:46.180]  crawling over everything they're doing they're they're sticking their nose
[3:03:46.180 --> 3:03:52.100]  into everything and and uh you know i i can sit on the
[3:03:52.100 --> 3:03:55.140]  sidelines now and i'm the cheering section
[3:03:55.140 --> 3:03:59.460]  uh and i'll be cheering them on and so
[3:03:59.460 --> 3:04:04.180]  we're going to find out where is all that wealth
[3:04:04.180 --> 3:04:11.220]  and i think there's enough to uh just absolutely restore this country back to
[3:04:11.220 --> 3:04:15.540]  its position where it belongs as the the
[3:04:15.540 --> 3:04:20.180]  the freest most most free people on the face of the earth

[3:08:05.140 --> 3:08:08.980]  well almost everyone uh let's check into the sports lodge
[3:08:14.980 --> 3:08:18.420]  all right roger i understand you have a very special guest uh and somewhat
[3:08:18.420 --> 3:08:21.540]  controversial too huh yeah this is going to be interesting
[3:08:21.540 --> 3:08:25.620]  my guest mark dies has a lot of interesting views on a lot of
[3:08:25.620 --> 3:08:31.540]  different things but this morning we are focusing on one thing and one thing
[3:08:31.540 --> 3:08:36.340]  only our guest mark dies says we should boycott the
[3:08:36.340 --> 3:08:40.020]  super bowl mr dice good morning sir good morning and i would
[3:08:40.020 --> 3:08:43.860]  rather have us focus on something other than the super bowl actually when
[3:08:43.860 --> 3:08:47.700]  when we have a society that knows and cares more about sports than they do
[3:08:47.700 --> 3:08:50.900]  about events that actually affect their lives i think
[3:08:50.900 --> 3:08:54.740]  that's a problem so i want to take this opportunity to urge people to
[3:08:54.740 --> 3:08:58.740]  boycott the super bowl to turn it off to to read a book
[3:08:58.740 --> 3:09:02.340]  and we can learn about some of the serious issues that affect us the
[3:09:02.340 --> 3:09:06.900]  builder bird groups the federal reserve maybe if we got as excited
[3:09:06.900 --> 3:09:11.380]  about politics and in yelled and screamed as loud as we do for sports then
[3:09:11.380 --> 3:09:13.780]  maybe we could prevent the scumbags in
[3:09:13.780 --> 3:09:17.300]  washington dc from flushing this country down the toilet
[3:09:17.300 --> 3:09:21.780]  let me ask you this what about the fact that on sunday i'm going to sit around
[3:09:21.780 --> 3:09:27.860]  with my family my three children 21 3 and 5 we're going to sit around we're
[3:09:27.860 --> 3:09:32.260]  going to enjoy a nice meal and we're going to enjoy a good
[3:09:32.260 --> 3:09:38.260]  healthy competition between two teams that have worked very hard to get there
[3:09:38.260 --> 3:09:41.620]  the saints have a lot to play for here for the city of new
[3:09:41.620 --> 3:09:44.820]  warlands what do you say to people like myself
[3:09:44.820 --> 3:09:48.820]  who say this is a wonderful opportunity for family time
[3:09:48.820 --> 3:09:52.740]  i think it's a wonderful opportunity for people to educate their families about
[3:09:52.740 --> 3:09:55.620]  the builder bird group about the certain political issues
[3:09:55.620 --> 3:09:59.220]  maybe you should watch a documentary filmed by alex jones watch fall of the
[3:09:59.220 --> 3:10:03.460]  republic or the obama deception and get involved instead of yelling and
[3:10:03.460 --> 3:10:07.060]  screaming about some people chasing a ball on a grass field how about we
[3:10:07.060 --> 3:10:10.820]  yell and scream about the politicians selling our country out
[3:10:10.820 --> 3:10:14.820]  and mark the only yelling i'm going to do is probably at my wife when i need
[3:10:14.820 --> 3:10:16.500]  another sandwich it's not going to be me
[3:10:16.500 --> 3:10:20.340]  wow but let me tell you what about to what about to what this does for the
[3:10:20.340 --> 3:10:23.380]  economy and how many millions of dollars this
[3:10:23.380 --> 3:10:26.900]  generates with you know just a you know in miami never mind you know all the
[3:10:26.900 --> 3:10:29.860]  people ordering pizzas and doing whatever this is great for the economy
[3:10:29.860 --> 3:10:32.900]  i don't think it offsets the damage that obama and his criminal
[3:10:32.900 --> 3:10:37.940]  okay i don't think that i'm a fan of president bush bush is a
[3:10:37.940 --> 3:10:41.060]  as a war criminal should be in prison too wait a second wait a second let me
[3:10:41.060 --> 3:10:44.260]  get back to what we're talking about let me make one more point let me make a
[3:10:44.260 --> 3:10:47.140]  point let me ask you this when i'm watching
[3:10:47.140 --> 3:10:50.420]  a sporting event with my five-year-old and my three-year-old
[3:10:50.420 --> 3:10:55.300]  and on a first down the colts get three yards you need 10 yards
[3:10:55.300 --> 3:10:58.660]  to get a first down and my five-year-old says to me
[3:10:58.660 --> 3:11:02.900]  well they got three yards daddy they need seven more yards for a first down
[3:11:02.900 --> 3:11:06.100]  there's a little education here involved as well
[3:11:06.100 --> 3:11:09.780]  and i don't think there's anything wrong with watching a good healthy
[3:11:09.780 --> 3:11:13.700]  athletic event if you use it right with your family
[3:11:13.700 --> 3:11:17.060]  i think it's a really good thing mark well i think sports is really the
[3:11:17.060 --> 3:11:20.740]  opiate of the masses and contributes to the downfall of the country so i urge
[3:11:20.740 --> 3:11:24.660]  everybody to boycott the super bowl go to markdice.com and watch some of my
[3:11:24.660 --> 3:11:28.420]  educational videos or the other works and read a book turn the television off
[3:11:28.420 --> 3:11:53.940]  the dice you know we didn't plan that bumper music
[3:11:53.940 --> 3:11:58.100]  everybody knows the dice is loaded we've got mark dice on the line
[3:11:58.100 --> 3:12:01.700]  with us again mark dice goes out he puts a youtube
[3:12:01.700 --> 3:12:06.580]  video up saying the super bowl is over the super bowl is off
[3:12:06.580 --> 3:12:10.020]  everybody goes in flocks to it super bowl is canceled i believe is the actual
[3:12:10.020 --> 3:12:13.620]  name of the video going from memory here mark can correct me
[3:12:13.620 --> 3:12:18.260]  and then he gets on kla tv i mean we're talking about guaranteed
[3:12:18.260 --> 3:12:22.980]  hundreds of thousands watching kla radio hundreds of thousands listening
[3:12:22.980 --> 3:12:28.020]  it goes viral on the web millions of people start thinking wait why am i
[3:12:28.020 --> 3:12:32.260]  only caring about sports as the country falls apart sure
[3:12:32.260 --> 3:12:36.020]  if we had george washington for president and we weren't
[3:12:36.020 --> 3:12:40.500]  uh you know 14 plus trillion dollars in debt just from last year alone
[3:12:40.500 --> 3:12:45.140]  and we didn't have the new jobless numbers were 400 000 now they've adjusted
[3:12:45.140 --> 3:12:49.540]  them to 800 plus thousand that's bloomberg a link up on info wars
[3:12:49.540 --> 3:12:54.660]  dot com right now i mean sure if everything was fine it'd be okay to
[3:12:54.660 --> 3:12:58.820]  only care about a football game but this is our new god
[3:12:58.820 --> 3:13:02.660]  that that we've given our freedom up for and i tell you mark they started
[3:13:02.660 --> 3:13:05.540]  panicking when you started bringing up real issues
[3:13:05.540 --> 3:13:09.060]  they didn't know what they were getting into when they had beyond because i
[3:13:09.060 --> 3:13:12.500]  think they just anticipated somebody was going to just talk about how
[3:13:12.500 --> 3:13:16.340]  importantly we should read some history and i don't think that they knew
[3:13:16.340 --> 3:13:19.540]  exactly what they were getting into and you could hear them cut me off as soon
[3:13:19.540 --> 3:13:23.620]  as i started criticizing obama but you continue to game them i mean i mean how
[3:13:23.620 --> 3:13:27.140]  many stunts like this have you pulled every one of them with more and more
[3:13:27.140 --> 3:13:30.100]  devastating effect i'll just one after the other i mean
[3:13:30.100 --> 3:13:33.300]  it's it you string them all together and it seems like this this incredible
[3:13:33.300 --> 3:13:36.420]  success sometimes it's few and far between that i'll have something hit
[3:13:36.420 --> 3:13:39.780]  this big but just look at what this does i mean this can
[3:13:39.780 --> 3:13:43.540]  this can reach there's there were half of it hundreds of thousands of people
[3:13:43.540 --> 3:13:46.420]  there's there's millions of people in los angeles
[3:13:46.420 --> 3:13:50.180]  and now you've got more media calling you so it's it's a snowball
[3:13:50.180 --> 3:13:55.620]  yeah this was also about my clip my video ramp was shown on a denver
[3:13:55.620 --> 3:13:59.540]  cbs affiliate i posted that on youtube they follow the copyright infringement
[3:13:59.540 --> 3:14:03.380]  claim and emailed me and they both pulled all copies of that video but it's
[3:14:03.380 --> 3:14:07.220]  getting out they wanted people to link to their copy streaming from their website
[3:14:07.220 --> 3:14:10.660]  so it's getting out and i also want to just urge everybody you know the next
[3:14:10.660 --> 3:14:13.780]  few days super bowl is going to be the hot the hot topic so we can if you're
[3:14:13.780 --> 3:14:17.780]  going to get sucked into that i'll try to use this as a as an angle
[3:14:17.780 --> 3:14:21.700]  to really make people think about what it is that i agree in fact mark
[3:14:21.700 --> 3:14:25.540]  i'm going to talk about your video and do one tonight that i'm going to have
[3:14:25.540 --> 3:14:28.980]  go mega viral pointing out that america's dying
[3:14:28.980 --> 3:14:33.300]  why do you only care about this football game and some people won't listen now
[3:14:33.300 --> 3:14:35.780]  but a couple years later when things are even worse
[3:14:35.780 --> 3:14:38.980]  they're going to remember and start getting their head screwed on straight
[3:14:38.980 --> 3:14:41.940]  well i think a lot of the people are going to maybe feel this sort of peer
[3:14:41.940 --> 3:14:45.060]  pressure that they have to sort of be interested and involved in the
[3:14:45.060 --> 3:14:48.820]  and the super bowl and the festivities this weekend i think we can provide an
[3:14:48.820 --> 3:14:51.620]  environment for them to feel safe and resisting that
[3:14:51.620 --> 3:14:55.380]  and and i've given them some ammunition that they could have sending people to
[3:14:55.380 --> 3:14:58.980]  super bowl parties with obama deception for the republic
[3:14:58.980 --> 3:15:03.460]  or your new book yeah you know and if you're gonna have to watch the game
[3:15:03.460 --> 3:15:07.220]  why don't you bring the dvd's and then afterwards when everybody's nice and

[3:15:21.140 --> 3:15:24.580]  some footage from i'm gonna post later of me kind of behind the scenes and i
[3:15:24.580 --> 3:15:28.020]  tell a producer came up and told me i can't videotape there but i'm just
[3:15:28.020 --> 3:15:32.100]  going to show break the illusion and most people think that
[3:15:32.100 --> 3:15:35.620]  los angeles and then hollywood la is just this beautiful
[3:15:35.620 --> 3:15:39.540]  disneyland but i got footage of behind the scenes of this television studio
[3:15:39.540 --> 3:15:43.380]  it's really nothing but the green room is the area where people go and
[3:15:43.380 --> 3:15:46.820]  sit people know this where you sit and kind of wait before you're a guest on
[3:15:46.820 --> 3:15:49.460]  a show and i would imagine that most people think that
[3:15:49.460 --> 3:15:52.500]  you know a green room at a los angeles television station it's going to be this
[3:15:52.500 --> 3:15:56.180]  luxurious area so just wait until you see the video footage that i post the
[3:15:56.180 --> 3:16:00.180]  green room just to shatter this illusion of this multi-million dollar
[3:16:00.180 --> 3:16:05.060]  propaganda machine well mark you continue to kick butt
[3:16:05.060 --> 3:16:08.900]  hundreds and hundreds of thousands of views with your video
[3:16:08.900 --> 3:16:12.580]  of the majority of people in san diego saying ban free speech
[3:16:12.580 --> 3:16:16.260]  arrest anybody that disagrees with obama cast sunstein is
[3:16:16.260 --> 3:16:19.700]  his regulations are is writing white papers on it
[3:16:19.700 --> 3:16:23.700]  and now they're openly announcing that google is spying on everybody for the
[3:16:23.700 --> 3:16:27.300]  nsa in the name of keeping us safe and we've got all these
[3:16:27.300 --> 3:16:31.380]  governments from italy to australia putting net censorship in
[3:16:31.380 --> 3:16:35.540]  that dwarfs even china and we've got time magazine calling
[3:16:35.540 --> 3:16:39.620]  for an internet id to even be able to get online worse than china
[3:16:39.620 --> 3:16:43.700]  yeah and this is not news to us but now it's front page on the drug report that
[3:16:43.700 --> 3:16:46.740]  the nsa is working with google so what i mean once again
[3:16:46.740 --> 3:16:50.900]  everything that's right i had that cia guy steal on what five years ago
[3:16:50.900 --> 3:16:55.540]  about how google's really a cia front well and again just gives more
[3:16:55.540 --> 3:16:59.220]  credibility to you to others and so i you know i just want to stress
[3:16:59.220 --> 3:17:02.020]  again let's use super bowl for the people are going to be going out brian
[3:17:02.020 --> 3:17:06.020]  new tv's today and tomorrow and saturday so why don't we need to pick it
[3:17:06.020 --> 3:17:09.780]  outside of them by some electronic stores that just really use this as an
[3:17:09.780 --> 3:17:15.220]  opportunity to the truth jam as i call it to culture jam to use the system
[3:17:15.220 --> 3:17:19.620]  you know against itself so just have to imagine no one's ever gone out front
[3:17:19.620 --> 3:17:22.580]  a sports bar and protested that it's a gladiatorial
[3:17:22.580 --> 3:17:26.260]  diversion one of two thousand years ago people would have gone and protested
[3:17:26.260 --> 3:17:30.020]  in front of the roman coliseum saying this is a distraction this is where
[3:17:30.020 --> 3:17:33.220]  you're trained to dehumanize your fellow humans
[3:17:33.220 --> 3:17:36.580]  where your neighbors being killed one week you're being killed the next week
[3:17:36.580 --> 3:17:40.100]  this is where you're dehumanized where you're taught to enjoy seeing your
[3:17:40.100 --> 3:17:45.140]  fellow man torn down this is a false religion an idle
[3:17:45.140 --> 3:17:48.900]  from real issues and real tribal energies
[3:17:48.900 --> 3:17:51.940]  of warfare that are meant to stand up for your family
[3:17:51.940 --> 3:17:55.220]  how about how about protesting the biggest sports bars
[3:17:55.220 --> 3:17:59.540]  not even protesting them just being there pointing out to folks a real wars
[3:17:59.540 --> 3:18:02.660]  going on yeah you know when you bring a megaphone
[3:18:02.660 --> 3:18:06.100]  into a sports bar just be careful you're gonna have a lot of angry drunk
[3:18:06.100 --> 3:18:09.700]  uh... football fans but it is a sad state of affairs when these football
[3:18:09.700 --> 3:18:13.220]  stars are are held up as heroes you know it's like they saved a bunch of
[3:18:13.220 --> 3:18:17.380]  children from a burning building you know the day a crackhead drug addict in
[3:18:17.380 --> 3:18:21.060]  fact here's one uh... national labor committee women paid
[3:18:21.060 --> 3:18:25.940]  ten cents to sew eighty dollar payton manning jerseys for nfl and
[3:18:25.940 --> 3:18:30.660]  rebauch since when are our colors not george washington
[3:18:30.660 --> 3:18:34.580]  declaration of independence and semi-automatic rifles
[3:18:34.580 --> 3:18:40.500]  since when did the jersey of an american not be freedom and liberty and ron paul
[3:18:40.500 --> 3:18:43.780]  in seventeen seventy six since when did it become a bunch of
[3:18:43.780 --> 3:18:47.860]  adult brain damaged drug addict steroid head
[3:18:47.860 --> 3:18:50.660]  with with pimples all over their faces and backs
[3:18:50.660 --> 3:18:55.060]  wallowing around with crack horse it's very sad again i understand some people
[3:18:55.060 --> 3:18:57.940]  can be football fans but it's just it really
[3:18:57.940 --> 3:19:02.420]  shows the state of america when people are more interested in that one
[3:19:02.420 --> 3:19:06.020]  just imagine what we could do if we got sixty thousand people instead of
[3:19:06.020 --> 3:19:09.140]  going to a stadium if we were to surround the white house on one week
[3:19:09.140 --> 3:19:12.500]  exact no no no that's why the u n and others say
[3:19:12.500 --> 3:19:16.260]  and even back in roman times they wrote they give you the sports stadiums and
[3:19:16.260 --> 3:19:19.780]  hype up sports so you'll be distracted under their
[3:19:19.780 --> 3:19:25.620]  tyranny and and again i see friends family catching their breath watching
[3:19:25.620 --> 3:19:30.340]  football we need that same excitement for liberty
[3:19:30.340 --> 3:19:34.420]  that's what's so sick they're scientifically using it mark

[3:24:15.860 --> 3:24:19.060]  number one on youtube till they started manipulating it and they
[3:24:19.060 --> 3:24:22.660]  clearly do that it doesn't matter i meant to cut some Monday or so when we
[3:24:22.660 --> 3:24:27.060]  posted it on info wars and time got away from me because it's a great idea
[3:24:27.060 --> 3:24:30.580]  and i imitate a lot of what mark does and he certainly learned some from me
[3:24:30.580 --> 3:24:34.260]  that's what we all do together and so i'm going to make several videos tonight
[3:24:34.260 --> 3:24:37.700]  that we need to go mega viral because you'll get football heads who aren't
[3:24:37.700 --> 3:24:42.020]  even thinking about this information to actually question hey you're losing
[3:24:42.020 --> 3:24:45.780]  your job uh the cps is trying to take your kids society's
[3:24:45.780 --> 3:24:49.700]  falling apart do you know the history of
[3:24:49.700 --> 3:24:54.740]  mega stadium sports sports itself are a great thing for young people
[3:24:54.740 --> 3:24:59.060]  and and but when it becomes these big you know mega spectacles
[3:24:59.060 --> 3:25:04.580]  it's just like gambling or the lottery or anything it's a sick joke mark dies
[3:25:04.580 --> 3:25:08.020]  we've got about four minutes left with you my friend i appreciate you
[3:25:08.020 --> 3:25:11.460]  contacting us letting us know this video was out it's awesome they're all
[3:25:11.460 --> 3:25:15.700]  up at mark dice dot com in fact where's a copy of his new book we're selling his
[3:25:15.700 --> 3:25:19.300]  new book uh as well you can't put down any of
[3:25:19.300 --> 3:25:22.900]  mark's books they're all available at info wars dot com but
[3:25:22.900 --> 3:25:26.580]  mark again some people say oh you just don't like football
[3:25:26.580 --> 3:25:31.060]  why did you decide to do this well because it's just it's true i mean it's
[3:25:31.060 --> 3:25:35.620]  sad when americans care more about worthless issues like that and it's
[3:25:35.620 --> 3:25:38.660]  such it's not even that okay i understand people can have their
[3:25:38.660 --> 3:25:42.100]  entertainment but it's such an obsession and that the football game
[3:25:42.100 --> 3:25:45.060]  especially the super bowl is built up to such a level
[3:25:45.060 --> 3:25:48.820]  and then also too i knew that the media was going to grab this story and run with
[3:25:48.820 --> 3:25:51.940]  it because since everybody loves the super bowl
[3:25:51.940 --> 3:25:54.820]  i mean who what kind of a person would boycott the super bowl that's an
[3:25:54.820 --> 3:25:58.740]  interesting story and so that's the that's the story that i said
[3:25:58.740 --> 3:26:03.380]  to the to the los angeles station and they grabbed it and ran with it and it
[3:26:03.380 --> 3:26:07.060]  is an interesting story but i don't think you're using their propaganda
[3:26:07.060 --> 3:26:10.820]  against them you're reaching sport zombies who are literally zombies don't
[3:26:10.820 --> 3:26:14.420]  even know what planet they're on through their own brainwashing
[3:26:14.420 --> 3:26:18.260]  you're waking them up to real issues look i know how the media works
[3:26:18.260 --> 3:26:21.780]  and if i want to be a scumbag i could be one of them but instead i want to use
[3:26:21.780 --> 3:26:26.180]  their system against the system and so that's kind of the the artwork that i've
[3:26:26.180 --> 3:26:30.740]  sort of that they're able to do is that i i can weasel my way into the
[3:26:30.740 --> 3:26:34.420]  mainstream media occasionally through a backdoor
[3:26:34.420 --> 3:26:38.740]  uh... with an issue that will then i will tie into something that's more
[3:26:38.740 --> 3:26:41.300]  important so this is just an incredible success
[3:26:41.300 --> 3:26:44.900]  but as soon as you brought up real issues they cut you off
[3:26:44.900 --> 3:26:47.940]  oh they didn't want to hear about it and you could hear roger lodge at the
[3:26:47.940 --> 3:26:51.540]  beginning is this we're only gonna focus on one thing
[3:26:51.540 --> 3:26:54.420]  and i think they just thought i was going to talk about how it'd be nice to
[3:26:54.420 --> 3:26:58.740]  learn from american history and people don't read enough but i don't think
[3:26:58.740 --> 3:27:00.980]  they knew what they were getting into when they had me on
[3:27:00.980 --> 3:27:04.260]  i don't know if they'll have me about back again ever
[3:27:04.260 --> 3:27:07.460]  yeah but there's a lot of other big media outlets that you can uh...
[3:27:07.460 --> 3:27:11.700]  you can infiltrate and again other people can do similar things to what
[3:27:11.700 --> 3:27:16.020]  you're doing it may not be on national tv or big los angeles tv but
[3:27:16.020 --> 3:27:19.060]  i mean look at the joker poster contest and we're getting ready i know i'm
[3:27:19.060 --> 3:27:22.100]  behind it's been so busy to launch the naked body scanner
[3:27:22.100 --> 3:27:26.900]  uh... contest i mean that was literally on hundreds of tv stations hundreds of
[3:27:26.900 --> 3:27:31.380]  newspapers japan germany england the u.s argentina
[3:27:31.380 --> 3:27:35.620]  uh... la tv chicago tv austin tv
[3:27:35.620 --> 3:27:39.220]  dalis tv little tv stations big tv stations
[3:27:39.220 --> 3:27:42.180]  all because listeners went out and put up obama posters
[3:27:42.180 --> 3:27:46.020]  saying fascist or socialist you get picked your poison we had both
[3:27:46.020 --> 3:27:49.940]  i mean it's command and control and they would freak out and say ban it ban it
[3:27:49.940 --> 3:27:53.860]  so people would put more up and they finally just shut up but that was
[3:27:53.860 --> 3:27:57.540]  devastating and we can pull these stunts on the enemy all day
[3:27:57.540 --> 3:28:01.300]  and teach other people how to do it well that's why your audience and in the
[3:28:01.300 --> 3:28:03.700]  movement is really just growing bigger and bigger
[3:28:03.700 --> 3:28:07.700]  i mean there's there's certain key times when it just wakes people up
[3:28:07.700 --> 3:28:11.060]  and i'm i'm sure that there's going to be so many people now that are thinking
[3:28:11.060 --> 3:28:14.900]  wait a minute why do i really care and get all excited about this and you know
[3:28:14.900 --> 3:28:18.900]  i kind of feel like i'm i'm a fish out of water sometimes you know i had
[3:28:18.900 --> 3:28:21.380]  dinner with some friends and friends of friends the other day and the first
[3:28:21.380 --> 3:28:24.820]  thing that these people ask me when i sat down is culture saint
[3:28:24.820 --> 3:28:28.820]  and i just i just couldn't take it you know
[3:28:28.820 --> 3:28:33.300]  it's people at gas stations people on the street culture saints
[3:28:33.300 --> 3:28:35.700]  we don't talk about how do we get together and defeat this corrupt
[3:28:35.700 --> 3:28:39.700]  government how do we get our country back how do we save our jobs how do we
[3:28:39.700 --> 3:28:43.460]  get our education system fixed how do we know it's like culture saints
[3:28:43.460 --> 3:28:47.220]  culture saints this is at the heart of what's wrong with our country
[3:28:47.220 --> 3:28:51.220]  america isn't about worshiping a bunch of crack heads
[3:28:51.220 --> 3:28:55.460]  it isn't about worshiping a bunch of roi heads it isn't about a bunch of
[3:28:55.460 --> 3:28:58.980]  steroid heads being worshiped it's about freedom
[3:28:58.980 --> 3:29:02.900]  once you start to become aware of these ideas as you know as i'm sure a bunch of
[3:29:02.900 --> 3:29:06.980]  the audience knows you just your eyes start to open and you completely start
[3:29:06.980 --> 3:29:11.460]  to see things for what they are you you are unplugged from the matrix it's like
[3:29:11.460 --> 3:29:15.140]  living in another world you like culture saints culture saints
[3:29:15.140 --> 3:29:19.060]  holy god a cracker but you're so much better by knowing
[3:29:19.060 --> 3:29:23.220]  and not being a sheep but not following the herd over a cliff
[3:29:23.220 --> 3:29:26.180]  you know sometimes knowing some of the information that we know is a little
[3:29:26.180 --> 3:29:30.660]  stressful but it's better to know it and be able to identify it and not be
[3:29:30.660 --> 3:29:36.180]  a a manipulated leaf in the wind or just a sheep in the herd

[3:33:28.020 --> 3:33:30.980]  want to stay with us for that retransmission
[3:33:30.980 --> 3:33:34.340]  look i know that most people know that
[3:33:34.340 --> 3:33:39.220]  agent orange is deadly but it's now been declassified
[3:33:39.220 --> 3:33:42.580]  and i have one of those recently declassified
[3:33:42.580 --> 3:33:46.820]  secret documents department of veterans affairs
[3:33:46.820 --> 3:33:51.140]  this is admiral er zumwalt jr i'd seen this but it was brought back to my
[3:33:51.140 --> 3:33:55.300]  attention and the fact that monsanto the folks that bring
[3:33:55.300 --> 3:33:59.860]  us all the gmo food that have natural pesticides in it so the bugs can't eat
[3:33:59.860 --> 3:34:03.540]  it then we eat it the study show it kills the rats
[3:34:03.540 --> 3:34:06.820]  has them have organ failure and we're eating this
[3:34:06.820 --> 3:34:10.580]  they know that this is happening why are they doing it
[3:34:10.580 --> 3:34:14.980]  and you go back to agent orange you know i had some family great loving
[3:34:14.980 --> 3:34:19.300]  wonderful family vietnam veteran helicopter pilot
[3:34:19.300 --> 3:34:24.180]  no history of any child deformities on either side of the family
[3:34:24.180 --> 3:34:27.780]  and they had their wonderful firstborn son clearly from agent orange all the
[3:34:27.780 --> 3:34:32.740]  classic things uh he died when he was a few years old
[3:34:32.740 --> 3:34:37.540]  and you look at the numbers of doubling tripling quadrupling and even more
[3:34:37.540 --> 3:34:42.660]  in southern syria in kosovo in
[3:34:42.660 --> 3:34:47.540]  iraq in other areas where this is being used at proving grounds they know what
[3:34:47.540 --> 3:34:52.020]  du's doing but monsanto's brought us aspartame
[3:34:52.020 --> 3:34:56.980]  you can't make this stuff up it is the excrement of a genetically engineered
[3:34:56.980 --> 3:35:00.980]  ecoli bacteria they feed it a toxic waste
[3:35:00.980 --> 3:35:04.420]  certain forms of toxic waste you don't believe me just fat guys google
[3:35:04.420 --> 3:35:08.340]  aspartame manufacturing process you'll be on university sites
[3:35:08.340 --> 3:35:11.220]  and so a genetically engineered bacteria
[3:35:11.220 --> 3:35:15.460]  defecates and then that's the toxic poison you drink that tastes so sweet
[3:35:15.460 --> 3:35:19.780]  kind of like another great example is you know your cat or dog will drink
[3:35:19.780 --> 3:35:23.300]  antifreeze it's very sweet the taste that kills
[3:35:23.300 --> 3:35:26.580]  but we have the gmo trilogy why genetically modified organisms threaten
[3:35:26.580 --> 3:35:29.780]  your healthy environment the future generations but going back
[3:35:29.780 --> 3:35:33.620]  to monsanto the chemical company they then split off and have the chemical
[3:35:33.620 --> 3:35:36.580]  division and then the division that's all closely
[3:35:36.580 --> 3:35:41.940]  interlocked for liability purposes with the gmo
[3:35:41.940 --> 3:35:45.780]  they've now got their smart stack corn it's gonna be the biggest crop planted
[3:35:45.780 --> 3:35:49.140]  this year replacing all their other main crops of corn
[3:35:49.140 --> 3:35:52.500]  that has six pesticides in it and two other traits
[3:35:52.500 --> 3:35:57.700]  eight genetic traits total but we go back to age and orange
[3:35:57.700 --> 3:36:01.060]  they knew day one this was dioxin they knew day one
[3:36:01.060 --> 3:36:07.940]  and i have the report here that it was massively more toxic than arsenic
[3:36:07.940 --> 3:36:11.780]  in fact i highlighted one copy of the report is this the one we highlighted
[3:36:11.780 --> 3:36:16.260]  so i wanted to go over some of those areas and this is what the army knew
[3:36:16.260 --> 3:36:20.740]  all along but they won't even give the the vets the treatment they need
[3:36:20.740 --> 3:36:25.620]  what does this tell you about the mindset of the elite that we have
[3:36:25.620 --> 3:36:29.380]  what does this tell you about their mindset i mean this tells you everything
[3:36:29.380 --> 3:36:32.660]  you need to know linda k may is an rn she's worked with
[3:36:32.660 --> 3:36:36.740]  dr dug rocky she came highly recommended from him
[3:36:36.740 --> 3:36:40.420]  and she is an expert on toxic chemicals she's worked in
[3:36:40.420 --> 3:36:44.020]  i mean i tried to go over all the things she's done state of illinois hazardous
[3:36:44.020 --> 3:36:48.340]  materials advisory board certification fire marshal site manager
[3:36:48.340 --> 3:36:52.100]  hazardous materials site manager department of veterans affairs hospital

[3:36:55.380 --> 3:36:58.900]  the medicine st louis university school of medicine multi-disciplinary
[3:36:58.900 --> 3:37:03.300]  certificate uh and geriatrics it goes on uh with all the
[3:37:03.300 --> 3:37:06.820]  things she's done uh associated illinois milk food
[3:37:06.820 --> 3:37:11.700]  environmental research pre-hospital i mean this goes on and on
[3:37:11.700 --> 3:37:14.340]  and she's been working with dr dug rocky for 30 years
[3:37:14.340 --> 3:37:19.460]  uh it's good to have you uh on linda k may thank you
[3:37:19.460 --> 3:37:23.860]  um you know i i just kind of recap some of the things with monsanto but
[3:37:23.860 --> 3:37:27.220]  specifically with agent orange there's been some new articles in the chicago
[3:37:27.220 --> 3:37:32.180]  tribune agent orange lethal legacy for us a record of neglect
[3:37:32.180 --> 3:37:35.460]  i mean i mean it's more than that poisonous defaulting it's still exact
[3:37:35.460 --> 3:37:41.300]  toll in us and vietnam uh break down your research into agent orange
[3:37:41.300 --> 3:37:45.060]  uh i have a number of years of research in toxic chemicals
[3:37:45.060 --> 3:37:49.700]  and their health effects uh the last four years i've spent doing research
[3:37:49.700 --> 3:37:55.540]  not only in black lab but agent orange agent orange has a biomarker which can
[3:37:55.540 --> 3:37:59.380]  be tested for in a urine sample the most
[3:37:59.380 --> 3:38:02.740]  important thing that would be of note is the u.s army medical
[3:38:02.740 --> 3:38:08.180]  research at fort digart maryland as well as the cdc all agree you
[3:38:08.180 --> 3:38:11.380]  cannot test for this toxin in any blood sample
[3:38:11.380 --> 3:38:16.820]  you can only test for in urine and that's done through dna pcr
[3:38:16.820 --> 3:38:21.780]  um the research has shown that it's been there for a lot of years
[3:38:21.780 --> 3:38:25.380]  basically we all know if you go before a judge in your class
[3:38:25.380 --> 3:38:29.220]  driving under the influence or using drugs that
[3:38:29.220 --> 3:38:33.380]  the judge will say i want a urine sample it's not a political court
[3:38:33.380 --> 3:38:39.460]  proof um the test exists and has existed and is available now publicly
[3:38:39.460 --> 3:38:44.420]  where you can literally pee in a jar and prove that not only you have the toxin
[3:38:44.420 --> 3:38:48.900]  in your body but you can measure the quantity of that toxin in it and
[3:38:48.900 --> 3:38:54.260]  there are 101 different research articles done by fort digart maryland
[3:38:54.260 --> 3:38:59.700]  specifically attached to chapter 34 and in that chapter all the research was
[3:38:59.700 --> 3:39:05.380]  done on u.s military subjects as you know when you're in military basically
[3:39:05.380 --> 3:39:08.420]  you know if they ask you to give a sample or you don't have a choice you give a
[3:39:08.420 --> 3:39:11.700]  sample but a lot of times they weren't told why
[3:39:11.700 --> 3:39:14.980]  but they may have served an area where the toxin was present
[3:39:14.980 --> 3:39:18.340]  and based on this research they were able to determine that
[3:39:18.340 --> 3:39:23.220]  what's important is the department of veterans affairs was given a report
[3:39:23.220 --> 3:39:29.700]  by admirals of all senior regarding the issue of asian orange and he was requested to do so
[3:39:29.700 --> 3:39:35.300]  i believe at white house request and that report was not released from
[3:39:35.300 --> 3:39:39.540]  declassification until a few years ago but the problem was it was never
[3:39:39.540 --> 3:39:43.460]  published in the united states it's been available in canada but
[3:39:43.460 --> 3:39:46.420]  nowhere in the united states was it found available
[3:39:46.420 --> 3:39:52.020]  and that's how you came to it was i gave it to Doug and asked if anyone had
[3:39:52.020 --> 3:39:55.060]  ever seen it and everyone was appalled because it would not
[3:39:55.060 --> 3:39:57.860]  published in the u.s
[3:39:58.500 --> 3:40:03.140]  and reading this report they know how deadly this is i mean
[3:40:03.140 --> 3:40:08.580]  and i mean describe what agent orange really is an agent blue and what it does
[3:40:08.580 --> 3:40:12.340]  okay what most people don't know and those of us who do
[3:40:12.340 --> 3:40:17.700]  who work with chemicals and and all the other substances that are harmful
[3:40:17.700 --> 3:40:21.860]  is agent orange basically had an orange stripe on the barrel
[3:40:21.860 --> 3:40:26.180]  back in the late 60s and 70s when a chemical was found to be really really
[3:40:26.180 --> 3:40:29.780]  hazardous you realize you had to put in a barrel and pay to bury it
[3:40:29.780 --> 3:40:35.220]  somewhere for a thousand years what the u.s government did
[3:40:35.220 --> 3:40:39.620]  and the chemical companies like was u.s government said okay we'll make half of
[3:40:39.620 --> 3:40:43.300]  each barrel die often call it agent orange
[3:40:43.300 --> 3:40:47.060]  and another half of the barrel that we normally would ask you to bury and pay
[3:40:47.060 --> 3:40:51.940]  a fee for we'll let you put in a barrel and on top of that in each barrel
[3:40:51.940 --> 3:40:56.420]  barrel it's buried from one gallon or three or ten depending on
[3:40:56.420 --> 3:41:00.980]  quantity at the time they put a biomarker in which was a neurotoxin
[3:41:00.980 --> 3:41:05.700]  so each barrel had not only a herbicide a pesticide a dioxin
[3:41:05.700 --> 3:41:09.060]  they added the neurotoxin to give it a biomarker
[3:41:09.060 --> 3:41:12.820]  so that we knew it was our chemical and then the u.s government department
[3:41:12.820 --> 3:41:18.260]  said we'll tell you now and all these are chemicals and we'll get rid of your
[3:41:18.260 --> 3:41:21.700]  chemicals for you instead of you having to pay to bury it in the u.s.
[3:41:21.700 --> 3:41:25.300]  now let's expand on that they put a neurotoxin in
[3:41:25.300 --> 3:41:28.500]  that attacks animals and people's brains
[3:41:28.500 --> 3:41:32.900]  knowing what they were doing uh i mean this is all done on purpose i mean i
[3:41:32.900 --> 3:41:37.860]  have explained it publicly is there was a neurotoxin in there
[3:41:37.860 --> 3:41:43.940]  neurotoxins as you know i put in pesticides herbicides and others to kill rodents
[3:41:43.940 --> 3:41:49.460]  not they put enough quantity in there wasn't just a little two ounce rodents
[3:41:49.460 --> 3:41:53.620]  this was big rodents two-legged seven hundred pounds
[3:41:53.620 --> 3:41:57.460]  yeah well bottom line ma'am ma'am have you seen the white house science is our
[3:41:57.460 --> 3:42:01.060]  own book where he says basically kill us like rodents i mean
[3:42:01.060 --> 3:42:04.020]  this is not being done by accident that you know they tell the guys it's a
[3:42:04.020 --> 3:42:07.700]  herbicide a defoliant and and really they're putting
[3:42:07.700 --> 3:42:11.220]  uh you know neurotoxin i mean for those that don't know that's not what a cobra
[3:42:11.220 --> 3:42:14.420]  has uh you know they're putting cobra venom in
[3:42:14.420 --> 3:42:20.100]  here basically synthetic cobra venom to attack humans uh what in the world is
[3:42:20.100 --> 3:42:25.060]  going and then they don't give the troops uh any medical care
[3:42:25.060 --> 3:42:28.740]  well i thought it was even more as they didn't tell the truth
[3:42:28.740 --> 3:42:33.460]  the truth about what they had and in this report it identifies that it was not
[3:42:33.460 --> 3:42:39.940]  diluted and it was used off the books by those people in the brown
[3:42:39.940 --> 3:42:43.460]  water navy and the blue water navy at full strength
[3:42:43.460 --> 3:42:46.740]  and then in other things and admiral some wall
[3:42:46.740 --> 3:42:51.300]  says that he knew it and authorized the use and then it wasn't recorded but
[3:42:51.300 --> 3:42:54.900]  that those men would be given the same medical care whether or not they had
[3:42:54.900 --> 3:42:59.940]  proof of it being used because they'd hear now can you talk about some wall
[3:42:59.940 --> 3:43:03.140]  because i know there's about to be a bunch of big media coming out on this
[3:43:03.140 --> 3:43:06.660]  and i don't want to i don't want to hurt that in any way
[3:43:06.660 --> 3:43:09.700]  i mean but i mean you've been doing deep investigation
[3:43:09.700 --> 3:43:12.500]  i mean how much can you tell us about some wall because you just don't have
[3:43:12.500 --> 3:43:18.340]  the document uh what i can say about this is i i've
[3:43:18.340 --> 3:43:23.700]  done my research and literature but i do know and have met the family
[3:43:23.700 --> 3:43:27.220]  they are grateful that the truth is coming out as you know admiral
[3:43:27.220 --> 3:43:33.700]  zunwall's son served in the navy and died of aged orange and admiral zunwall
[3:43:33.700 --> 3:43:38.740]  senior wrote this document knowing the truth about it wanting the truth
[3:43:38.740 --> 3:43:42.820]  out there but was told that it was classified and that he could not
[3:43:42.820 --> 3:43:46.100]  speak i do know that the family has sort of
[3:43:46.100 --> 3:43:49.940]  has suffered with the loss of family members due to
[3:43:49.940 --> 3:43:54.340]  the exposure as everyone is probably where there are navy family
[3:43:54.340 --> 3:43:58.740]  everyone in his family did serve in combat areas at one time or another
[3:43:58.740 --> 3:44:03.060]  and they have suffered the revenge of aged orange well this has hurt my family
[3:44:03.060 --> 3:44:06.420]  this has hurt my family as well and probably most families listening
[3:44:06.420 --> 3:44:09.780]  but again people only care about the super bowl they'll get mad at the
[3:44:09.780 --> 3:44:13.380]  cults lose or or or or if the saints lose
[3:44:13.380 --> 3:44:18.580]  this is the mental illness everyone i know has had somebody hurt or killed
[3:44:18.580 --> 3:44:22.660]  or deformed children from this garbage who was in vietnam while it was being
[3:44:22.660 --> 3:44:28.500]  used and they know it and here is the admiral losing his son from it
[3:44:28.500 --> 3:44:33.060]  i mean why are we killing ourselves the deus even worse
[3:44:33.060 --> 3:44:40.420]  why are we why why why why why i can't answer that i know that you know um
[3:44:40.420 --> 3:44:44.260]  the chemical safety laws weren't put into effect until the 70s
[3:44:44.260 --> 3:44:49.380]  but it was very apparent that admiral zunwall was aware of it and he regretted
[3:44:49.380 --> 3:44:52.980]  signing the order to use it as a pesticide herbicide
[3:44:52.980 --> 3:44:57.860]  and it cut deeply personally for him i can say in one section
[3:44:57.860 --> 3:45:02.740]  you know just to verify it says a major source of exposure for ground forces
[3:45:02.740 --> 3:45:08.020]  were from non-recorded uses by groundwater and blue water navy
[3:45:08.020 --> 3:45:14.260]  in addition to the flyovers by ranch hand this document is is
[3:45:14.260 --> 3:45:19.940]  quite broad and specific and basically gives people benefits they've stopped
[3:45:19.940 --> 3:45:23.700]  for 30 to 40 years linda you're not on a speakerphone are you
[3:45:23.700 --> 3:45:26.740]  no i'm not it's just a little bit echo we try to get a little bit closer to
[3:45:26.740 --> 3:45:29.300]  the receiver for me you know i'm definitely gonna have to have you back
[3:45:29.300 --> 3:45:33.060]  up in the near future because you've got so much knowledge so much research and
[3:45:33.060 --> 3:45:36.020]  come so highly recommended by dr. dug rocky
[3:45:36.020 --> 3:45:39.940]  i mean we have the scandal of this happening and and similar things being
[3:45:39.940 --> 3:45:44.660]  used today and and du and all of this uh but i guess the larger issue is
[3:45:44.660 --> 3:45:48.100]  according to the research i've done but correct me if i'm wrong
[3:45:48.100 --> 3:45:52.020]  they're still trying to deny treatment deny payments
[3:45:52.020 --> 3:45:56.340]  to families uh dealing with age and orange yes
[3:45:56.340 --> 3:46:03.300]  they are and this document very clearly shows where there was a deliberate
[3:46:03.300 --> 3:46:07.460]  attempt to ensure that people were denied coverage from the exposure
[3:46:07.460 --> 3:46:11.940]  um that's the important point of the document is this document
[3:46:11.940 --> 3:46:17.060]  clears up that issue and makes it very clear that all those backlogs people
[3:46:17.060 --> 3:46:20.660]  waiting for benefits should be granted those benefits immediately from you
[3:46:20.660 --> 3:46:25.060]  know why they put the human nerve killer the neurotoxin in it i mean they say
[3:46:25.060 --> 3:46:28.500]  as a marker so they would know it was theirs i mean what what does that mean
[3:46:28.500 --> 3:46:33.460]  what and and you said it it rates you know meant to kill humans i mean you
[3:46:33.460 --> 3:46:39.780]  killing 200 pound rats right um in other words with different countries
[3:46:39.780 --> 3:46:45.380]  involved in a war you want to biomark your steps just to know it's your poison
[3:46:45.380 --> 3:46:48.660]  versus somebody else's it's like a marker on a bullet
[3:46:48.660 --> 3:46:52.580]  and so this particular thing was put in there
[3:46:52.580 --> 3:46:56.580]  i suspect with the term of being a marker
[3:46:56.580 --> 3:47:01.140]  because they had identified it as a marker in 1943 when it was
[3:47:01.140 --> 3:47:06.420]  found at the University of Chicago that they put larger quantities in knowing
[3:47:06.420 --> 3:47:10.500]  that it would become a nerve toxin and would demonstrate to the
[3:47:10.500 --> 3:47:15.620]  larger animals and rodents versus the smaller animals
[3:47:16.260 --> 3:47:20.660]  and knowing our troops knowing our troops we're going to ingest it
[3:47:20.660 --> 3:47:24.580]  correct so so i mean for whatever reason
[3:47:24.580 --> 3:47:28.580]  McNamara and then others after him knew our troops were getting hit with
[3:47:28.580 --> 3:47:33.460]  super weapons grade neurotoxin on top of the dioxin
[3:47:33.460 --> 3:47:37.940]  yes very nice people
[3:47:40.820 --> 3:47:44.580]  from your research into this what are the effects of the neurotoxin the
[3:47:44.580 --> 3:47:48.820]  dioxin and the other chemicals what it essentially does
[3:47:48.820 --> 3:47:55.140]  in those expos is the toxin embeds itself inside the cellular DNA and at
[3:47:55.140 --> 3:47:59.620]  that level it is passed on in body fluid and sperm
[3:47:59.620 --> 3:48:03.060]  so that when husbands and wives go home
[3:48:03.060 --> 3:48:07.140]  they pass it on to their unborn children and those defects
[3:48:07.140 --> 3:48:10.580]  are passed on to other great-grandchildren etc
[3:48:10.580 --> 3:48:15.140]  so you basically it's a take-home poison to the greater population
[3:48:15.140 --> 3:48:18.740]  and it wrecks DNA and most the time you end up having a miscarriage instead of
[3:48:18.740 --> 3:48:22.580]  a deformed baby so it's also a sterile
[3:48:22.580 --> 3:48:28.500]  i'm i'm not specifically saying that what i'm saying is it embeds itself in
[3:48:28.500 --> 3:48:32.500]  the cellular DNA and wreaks havoc from that point on and they admit that in
[3:48:32.500 --> 3:48:35.940]  this report i mean reading this report this is from the military
[3:48:35.940 --> 3:48:40.340]  yes it is it's admitted and it's admitted that not only does it kill your
[3:48:40.340 --> 3:48:42.820]  children it kills your grandchildren and any other
[3:48:42.820 --> 3:48:47.460]  member of your family that comes in contact with it
[3:48:47.460 --> 3:48:52.500]  because it breaks up the DNA which which and i've seen major studies
[3:48:52.500 --> 3:48:56.180]  in fact google this human DNA mutating
[3:48:56.180 --> 3:49:00.100]  faster and it's scientists baffled at human DNA
[3:49:00.100 --> 3:49:05.060]  suddenly mutating my god these people are out of control
[3:49:05.060 --> 3:49:08.660]  well it's been known for a number of years
[3:49:08.660 --> 3:49:11.940]  and it was identified in government reports
[3:49:11.940 --> 3:49:15.700]  as in this one to the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs and it
[3:49:15.700 --> 3:49:19.860]  would give people benefits that they'd earned in the military knowing that they
[3:49:19.860 --> 3:49:23.700]  would be quite yellow and probably would die within a few years from their
[3:49:23.700 --> 3:49:29.220]  exposure. Well i've been studying Monsanto it
[3:49:29.220 --> 3:49:32.260]  turns out they knew in the 50s and 60s that this
[3:49:32.260 --> 3:49:36.740]  dioxin based stuff was deadly and they were burying it all over the country so
[3:49:36.740 --> 3:49:41.940]  why do you think Monsanto and other chemical companies don't care?
[3:49:41.940 --> 3:49:49.780]  One of the paragraphs is very important to the document and it's on my page 35
[3:49:49.780 --> 3:49:53.540]  it's a shame for me the deception brought in political interference
[3:49:53.540 --> 3:49:59.300]  is characterized government-sponsored studies of the health effects basically
[3:49:59.300 --> 3:50:02.500]  i don't think admiral Zomarot was giving all the facts when he
[3:50:02.500 --> 3:50:06.180]  ordered this to be used to kill the the weeds and the
[3:50:06.180 --> 3:50:10.580]  fauna that were you know hiding people that were shooting at them
[3:50:10.580 --> 3:50:13.780]  i don't think he knew it didn't become available to people until
[3:50:13.780 --> 3:50:17.380]  after it was being used over there so i mean
[3:50:17.380 --> 3:50:21.860]  the government he had the facts and the drug company and the chemical
[3:50:21.860 --> 3:50:26.980]  companies also helped him do that. Yeah i'm reading here from the admiral's
[3:50:26.980 --> 3:50:31.860]  own secret report here about the shameful deception fraud
[3:50:31.860 --> 3:50:34.660]  and political interference that is characterized government-sponsored
[3:50:34.660 --> 3:50:38.260]  studies on the health. We're going to come back and talk
[3:50:38.260 --> 3:50:43.620]  about what we can do to try to help people and then de-use
[3:50:43.620 --> 3:50:48.740]  got a 40-something million year total half-life till it
[3:50:48.740 --> 3:50:51.700]  and they're using that all over the place pretty soon they might put it in the
[3:50:51.700 --> 3:50:54.180]  water and say it's like fluoride good for your teeth i mean
[3:50:54.180 --> 3:50:57.620]  there's no end to what these people will do they might say shooting yourself in
[3:50:57.620 --> 3:50:59.860]  the head is good you know we'll be right back with our
[3:50:59.860 --> 3:51:03.700]  guests. Americans have heard much about change

[3:52:14.180 --> 3:52:17.380]  americans at home i've turned a memories influence
[3:52:17.380 --> 3:52:21.780]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots i think
[3:52:21.780 --> 3:52:26.020]  it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay

[3:52:39.140 --> 3:52:42.420]  they're asking for more matches and the congress is saying who do we make the

[3:54:07.060 --> 3:54:10.500]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:54:10.500 --> 3:54:14.980]  Our guest is Linda K. May, RN, in-depth researcher working with Dr. Doug
[3:54:14.980 --> 3:54:20.500]  Rocky and others for 30 years. We know that Iraq is now suing the U.S.
[3:54:20.500 --> 3:54:24.260]  for using DU. It's confirmed it's causing mass deformities, illnesses and
[3:54:24.260 --> 3:54:27.060]  deaths. What about Vietnam? What about
[3:54:27.060 --> 3:54:30.660]  communities in the U.S. that have this Agent Orange and other dioxin
[3:54:30.660 --> 3:54:34.340]  all over the place? I mean, from reading the reports, the
[3:54:34.340 --> 3:54:37.620]  health effects are still continuing.
[3:54:38.020 --> 3:54:43.780]  Yes, there are. As you know, the toxin stays in the water in the food for 700
[3:54:43.780 --> 3:54:47.140]  years and Admiral Zumwalt talks about the
[3:54:47.140 --> 3:54:52.420]  act, the migration of the toxin into the river channels in the food chain
[3:54:52.420 --> 3:54:55.380]  of Vietnam. And that's why they have such a large problem with
[3:54:55.380 --> 3:55:00.260]  birth defects and pregnancy and other issues. The
[3:55:00.260 --> 3:55:04.580]  water there is still contaminated with the toxin.
[3:55:05.860 --> 3:55:10.820]  And these companies and the military have just gotten away with it?
[3:55:10.820 --> 3:55:14.340]  I understand that the courts have ruled that this statute of limitations is out
[3:55:14.340 --> 3:55:19.220]  of order. So, if you knowingly poison people, there's
[3:55:19.220 --> 3:55:22.100]  a statute of limitations. I thought there's no statute of limitations on
[3:55:22.100 --> 3:55:24.260]  murder.
[3:55:25.380 --> 3:55:29.460]  Again, that's an issue I haven't dug into. I'm just well aware of
[3:55:29.460 --> 3:55:32.500]  what is going on in the country. No, no, I mean, I know you're right about that. I mean,
[3:55:32.500 --> 3:55:34.580]  I know you're right about them saying, hey,
[3:55:34.580 --> 3:55:38.180]  you know, no big deal. But you've also researched other
[3:55:38.180 --> 3:55:40.820]  chemicals and things that are being used currently.
[3:55:40.820 --> 3:55:44.100]  Yes, I have. And the same issue is true there too.
[3:55:44.100 --> 3:55:49.140]  They do stay around for thousands of years and they assess the population
[3:55:49.140 --> 3:55:54.180]  to come unborn. Yes. But they're telling us carbon dioxide is what has to be
[3:55:54.180 --> 3:55:58.980]  regulated and stopped. Plants breathe it. But, hey, Agent Orange, DU,
[3:55:58.980 --> 3:56:02.980]  40 billion year, you know, until it's not radioactive, what is it? 45
[3:56:02.980 --> 3:56:05.940]  billion years, 700 years for Agent Orange,
[3:56:05.940 --> 3:56:11.220]  A-OK. But you know what? We got to put a tax on your can of beans or on a beef
[3:56:11.220 --> 3:56:14.260]  steak. I mean, this is a big sick joke. What are
[3:56:14.260 --> 3:56:17.540]  the websites we can visit? What can we do? I know there's a lot of
[3:56:17.540 --> 3:56:20.900]  media coming out on this now, thanks to your work and others.
[3:56:20.900 --> 3:56:24.820]  But what else can we do to expose this and fight this?
[3:56:24.820 --> 3:56:30.500]  What I asked your people to do was to put up this article on your website and make
[3:56:30.500 --> 3:56:34.420]  it available. And then I would ask them to ensure that
[3:56:34.420 --> 3:56:38.900]  they let others know that they are entitled to benefits and then,
[3:56:38.900 --> 3:56:42.180]  you know, let your congressmen know that the documents do exist out there and
[3:56:42.180 --> 3:56:46.660]  that it's time to act and not use toxins to affect,
[3:56:46.660 --> 3:56:51.300]  you know, our great grandchildren should they be born later on.
[3:56:51.300 --> 3:56:54.340]  Well, that's the thing about conservative veterans and people who've had
[3:56:54.340 --> 3:56:58.580]  their children deformed or have cancer. The VA tells them, oh, you don't get any
[3:56:58.580 --> 3:57:01.140]  benefits. No under law you're supposed to. We are
[3:57:01.140 --> 3:57:04.820]  going to post this Department of Veterans Affairs now declassified secret
[3:57:04.820 --> 3:57:07.060]  document and we're also going to put a link up to the
[3:57:07.060 --> 3:57:10.900]  Chicago Tribune's latest on this. I know more is coming out, but we'll leave it
[3:57:10.900 --> 3:57:15.460]  at that for now. Thank you so much for the great work
[3:57:15.460 --> 3:57:19.860]  that you're doing, Linda May. God bless you. Thank you.
[3:57:19.860 --> 3:57:25.380]  Take care. You know, I've been trying to go back into issues like Aspartame, Agent
[3:57:25.380 --> 3:57:29.380]  Orange, DU, so that you can then understand
[3:57:29.380 --> 3:57:33.620]  that this is an agenda just like the genetically modified crops.
[3:57:33.620 --> 3:57:37.620]  They know it's killing you and causing organ failure
[3:57:37.620 --> 3:57:41.460]  and leukemia in all their studies and they are pushing it
[3:57:41.460 --> 3:57:45.220]  and pushing it hard. Most other countries have banned it. The U.S.
[3:57:45.220 --> 3:57:49.940]  pushes it for the school lunch programs, everything. This is eugenics.
[3:57:49.940 --> 3:57:53.700]  This is the orderly extermination of our population.
[3:57:53.700 --> 3:57:58.340]  Adding a deadly neurotoxin to eat your brain
[3:57:58.340 --> 3:58:02.020]  into this stuff. They know what they're doing.
[3:58:02.020 --> 3:58:05.460]  They hate the police. They hate the military.
[3:58:05.460 --> 3:58:08.900]  They know when you're 20 and young and dumb, you're going to serve them, but
[3:58:08.900 --> 3:58:12.180]  they know when you're 40, you're going to wake up. So they want you to be
[3:58:12.180 --> 3:58:17.460]  so weak and so poisoned and dying that you can't stand up against them.
[3:58:17.460 --> 3:58:20.820]  Red Beckman coming up in the retransmission on the infowars.com
[3:58:20.820 --> 3:58:24.500]  restreams right now. Just go to infowars.com, click on the live

[3:58:28.500 --> 3:58:31.940]  Please keep spreading the word about the show. We can expose the globalist crimes.
[3:58:31.940 --> 3:58:35.060]  We'll bring them to justice and that's starting to happen, but we got a long
[3:58:35.060 --> 3:58:38.900]  way to go, but we are getting traction. Great job, crew. See you back live tomorrow.
[3:58:38.900 --> 3:58:41.540]  11 a.m.
[3:58:43.140 --> 3:58:51.060]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[3:58:51.060 --> 3:58:54.900]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[3:58:54.900 --> 3:58:57.780]  generator. Number one, new climate legislation
[3:58:57.780 --> 3:59:00.020]  could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[3:59:00.020 --> 3:59:04.260]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric
[3:59:04.260 --> 3:59:07.860]  company allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of
[3:59:07.860 --> 3:59:11.380]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[3:59:11.380 --> 3:59:15.060]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously
[3:59:15.060 --> 3:59:18.500]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[3:59:18.500 --> 3:59:21.940]  compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a
[3:59:21.940 --> 3:59:25.060]  threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose
[3:59:25.060 --> 3:59:29.060]  their power from weather-related onages. Number five, a solar power generator
[3:59:29.060 --> 3:59:32.820]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in
[3:59:32.820 --> 3:59:36.100]  the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old
[3:59:36.100 --> 3:59:41.140]  sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[3:59:41.140 --> 3:59:45.140]  That's mysolarbackup.com. Remember, the government doesn't own the sun,
