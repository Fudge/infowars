[00:00:04.815 --> 00:00:06.137]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.137 --> 00:00:07.899]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:09.661]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.661 --> 00:00:11.243]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.243 --> 00:00:12.165]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.165 --> 00:00:16.991]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.991 --> 00:00:21.036]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:41.984]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, welcome and thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:41.984 --> 00:00:47.849]  I can't believe the news that's in my stack today.
[00:00:47.849 --> 00:00:55.495]  I just can't believe it, but it only confirms our worst fears about government.
[00:00:55.495 --> 00:01:00.379]  I'm going to break down all the top stories here in just a moment.
[00:01:01.423 --> 00:01:05.167]  It is Thursday, the fourth day of February 2010.
[00:01:05.167 --> 00:01:11.313]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:01:11.313 --> 00:01:22.445]  Red Beckman, an icon in the Patriot Liberty Movement against the private Federal Reserve, someone who co-authored The Law That Never Was, exposing the private run-for-profit
[00:01:23.911 --> 00:01:29.552]  Federal Reserve's collection agency, the IRS, will be joining us in the next hour.
[00:01:29.552 --> 00:01:34.914]  And I've been intending to get him back on for a few weeks.
[00:01:34.914 --> 00:01:52.038]  I'd also been working on getting Eustace Mullins back on, but I knew that he'd been sick, and then better, and then he'd do interviews, and then he went on a speaking tour over the weekend and had a stroke and was taken back to Texas and died on Tuesday.
[00:01:54.394 --> 00:02:02.117]  So we've posted some of my interviews with Useless Mullins up on InfoWars.com.
[00:02:02.117 --> 00:02:10.900]  A real trailblazer when it came to exposing the true architecture of the government, the private run-for-profit Federal Reserve.
[00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:17.363]  I interviewed him many times and will certainly miss his passing, knowing now though that he's in a better place.
[00:02:20.635 --> 00:02:27.918]  Certainly a controversial figure, but a real trailblazer when it came to exposing the private run-for-profit shadow government.
[00:02:27.918 --> 00:02:36.542]  We're going to have another icon of resistance, Red Beckman, coming up in the next hour.
[00:02:37.602 --> 00:02:41.324]  We're gonna have wide open phones for the balance of the radio broadcast.
[00:02:41.324 --> 00:02:54.353]  I've got a researcher coming on the last 30 minutes to deal with the aftermath of Agent Orange and how that ties into the current activities of Monsanto with their genetically modified crops.
[00:02:54.353 --> 00:02:56.054]  They brought you aspartame.
[00:02:56.054 --> 00:02:58.495]  It seems like they only bring you things that are evil.
[00:02:58.495 --> 00:03:03.719]  So we're gonna be breaking that down as well today.
[00:03:07.537 --> 00:03:23.770]  But when I saw this story today out of the Arizona Republic newspaper, I was really taken aback.
[00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:36.120]  And I already consciously knew this, but to see it manifest this fast blew my mind.
[00:03:38.593 --> 00:03:46.980]  And so our top story today, I'm going to run through some of the stories I've got here first, but then I'm going to detail this.
[00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:57.389]  Phoenix gives okay to 2% tax on food.
[00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:02.974]  Baby food, milk, meat, vegetables, rice, water.
[00:04:04.634 --> 00:04:10.799]  Anything you consume, the Romans, at the height of their tyranny, would not put taxes on food.
[00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:17.284]  In fact, subsidize it to the poor.
[00:04:17.284 --> 00:04:21.267]  No one ever in history taxes food.
[00:04:21.267 --> 00:04:23.488]  It is the big no-no.
[00:04:23.488 --> 00:04:25.710]  It hits the poor the worst.
[00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.112]  But this is your government, America, and
[00:04:31.966 --> 00:04:37.750]  I went and did some research and found out a bunch of other cities and states are saying, yeah, we're going to tax your food.
[00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.012]  We've got to pay the bankers everything.
[00:04:40.012 --> 00:04:46.396]  I mean, we really are pathetic putting up with this.
[00:04:46.396 --> 00:04:50.579]  Because God forbid they get rid of any of the government bureaucrats they're hiring.
[00:04:50.579 --> 00:04:53.821]  And of course, their pay's all going up on average.
[00:04:53.821 --> 00:04:58.605]  They're literally going to take the food out of our mouths with their fat, bloated bellies.
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.523]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:05:04.523 --> 00:05:05.424]  Number 1.
[00:05:05.424 --> 00:05:08.846]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:05:08.846 --> 00:05:09.707]  Number 2.
[00:05:09.707 --> 00:05:14.610]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:15.350]  It's true.
[00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:20.214]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:05:20.214 --> 00:05:21.054]  Number 3.
[00:05:21.054 --> 00:05:24.636]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:05:24.636 --> 00:05:28.339]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:29.320]  Number 4.
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.102]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:05:32.102 --> 00:05:35.765]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:05:35.765 --> 00:05:36.566]  Number 5.
[00:05:36.566 --> 00:05:40.710]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:45.474]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:05:45.754 --> 00:05:49.917]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:05:49.917 --> 00:05:51.719]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:53.981]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:05:53.981 --> 00:06:02.188]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:06:02.188 --> 00:06:06.211]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:06:06.211 --> 00:06:09.454]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:06:09.454 --> 00:06:10.875]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:06:11.562 --> 00:06:14.224]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:06:14.224 --> 00:06:20.630]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:25.814]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:06:25.814 --> 00:06:35.822]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:06:35.922 --> 00:06:38.284]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:06:38.284 --> 00:06:39.865]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:06:39.865 --> 00:06:42.327]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:06:42.327 --> 00:06:44.448]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:06:44.448 --> 00:06:49.612]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:06:49.612 --> 00:06:58.718]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:07:00.851 --> 00:07:07.854]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:07:07.854 --> 00:07:09.935]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[00:07:09.935 --> 00:07:13.837]  I know because I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[00:07:13.837 --> 00:07:18.299]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[00:07:18.299 --> 00:07:20.580]  Clean, great-tasting water without all the pollutants.
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:21.000]  I think?
[00:07:37.555 --> 00:07:40.236]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:08.371 --> 00:08:10.732]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:08:10.732 --> 00:08:14.053]  Crashing with lies and disinformation.
[00:08:14.053 --> 00:08:15.653]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:08:15.653 --> 00:08:16.754]  to 3 p.m.
[00:08:16.754 --> 00:08:18.494]  Central Standard Time.
[00:08:18.494 --> 00:08:22.916]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:08:22.916 --> 00:08:25.317]  Let me run through some of the headlines.
[00:08:25.317 --> 00:08:27.477]  One of the five stacks I have.
[00:08:27.477 --> 00:08:32.039]  Phoenix gives okay to 2% tax on food.
[00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:35.160]  Including baby food, everything, water, you name it.
[00:08:36.187 --> 00:08:38.067]  Everything must be paid to the bankers.
[00:08:38.067 --> 00:08:39.368]  Everything.
[00:08:39.368 --> 00:08:42.848]  Everything must go.
[00:08:42.848 --> 00:08:55.511]  Pennsylvania State Capitol mulls bankruptcy as budget option but won't dare cut any of the bloated government or the fact that most of the taxpayer money goes to interest to the bankers that they made out of nothing.
[00:08:55.511 --> 00:08:56.851]  Bloomberg.
[00:08:56.851 --> 00:09:02.452]  Pennsylvania Capitol buried an incinerator of debt.
[00:09:02.452 --> 00:09:03.332]  Wall Street Journal.
[00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:05.631]  U.S.
[00:09:05.631 --> 00:09:10.454]  debt to hit proposed ceiling by end of February.
[00:09:10.454 --> 00:09:14.357]  $14.3 trillion owed from just last year.
[00:09:14.357 --> 00:09:22.923]  That's what's currently owed, not all of the commitments that they've made.
[00:09:22.923 --> 00:09:25.685]  Next in line for bailout, Social Security.
[00:09:25.685 --> 00:09:30.348]  Gotta raise taxes for that.
[00:09:30.348 --> 00:09:33.431]  First-time jobless claims rise unexpectedly.
[00:09:34.645 --> 00:09:39.886]  New jobless claims rise unexpectedly to 480,000 as layoffs continue.
[00:09:39.886 --> 00:09:41.306]  Jobs remain scarce.
[00:09:41.306 --> 00:09:43.547]  Yeah, on average it's over 400,000 a month.
[00:09:43.547 --> 00:09:44.927]  Some months it's been 700,000.
[00:09:44.927 --> 00:09:47.488]  And it just continues as the news tells you.
[00:09:47.488 --> 00:09:48.688]  The economy is great!
[00:09:48.688 --> 00:09:50.589]  The banks are making record profits!
[00:09:50.589 --> 00:09:52.769]  We're gonna tax your food!
[00:09:52.769 --> 00:09:54.869]  We're hiring more men with automatic weapons!
[00:09:54.869 --> 00:09:56.410]  They wear black uniforms!
[00:09:56.410 --> 00:10:00.451]  Northcom is watching you!
[00:10:00.451 --> 00:10:01.591]  Don't try to resist!
[00:10:03.157 --> 00:10:03.797]  Lay down.
[00:10:03.797 --> 00:10:04.878]  Don't try to protest.
[00:10:04.878 --> 00:10:06.938]  We'll billy club you.
[00:10:06.938 --> 00:10:08.659]  This country's owned by foreign banks.
[00:10:08.659 --> 00:10:10.579]  Get used to it.
[00:10:10.579 --> 00:10:14.400]  You want a 2.6 billion dollar tax in three years in Austin?
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.041]  Three years you'll pay 2.6 billion dollars?
[00:10:17.041 --> 00:10:17.982]  You don't want it?
[00:10:17.982 --> 00:10:20.582]  It's all based on the carbon tax fraud?
[00:10:20.582 --> 00:10:21.703]  We don't care.
[00:10:21.703 --> 00:10:24.244]  We have armed men.
[00:10:24.244 --> 00:10:27.785]  We've put an NSA tracking grid in over you with the fusion centers.
[00:10:27.785 --> 00:10:29.665]  We're going to take your blood without warrants.
[00:10:29.665 --> 00:10:31.726]  We're going to shut down gun shows without laws.
[00:10:32.813 --> 00:10:33.894]  This is tyranny!
[00:10:33.894 --> 00:10:35.155]  Hope you enjoy it!
[00:10:35.155 --> 00:10:35.996]  More coming!
[00:10:35.996 --> 00:10:38.177]  Ha ha ha!
[00:10:38.177 --> 00:10:39.398]  The Washington Post!
[00:10:39.398 --> 00:10:44.622]  Google to enlist NSA to help it ward off cyber attacks.
[00:10:44.622 --> 00:10:56.612]  Of course, we have the head of cyber security last year resigning, saying the Pentagon is taking over the web and spying on everyone, and now the UN and Obama are announcing the UN treaty to end free speech on the web.
[00:10:56.612 --> 00:10:59.254]  The public can't believe it's happened.
[00:10:59.254 --> 00:11:01.316]  Sticks the thumb in their mouth begin sucking.
[00:11:04.056 --> 00:11:07.358]  Police want backdoor to web users' private data.
[00:11:07.358 --> 00:11:09.460]  CNET News.
[00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:13.202]  White House prepares for possibility of two Supreme Court vacancies.
[00:11:13.202 --> 00:11:14.503]  ABC News.
[00:11:14.503 --> 00:11:20.607]  Cass Sunstein waiting to replace Justice Stevens in Ginsburg.
[00:11:20.607 --> 00:11:27.632]  Cass Sunstein, who openly writes that they want to ban free speech and arrest you if you don't believe in global warming.
[00:11:29.065 --> 00:11:32.606]  And thousands of other conspiracy theories.
[00:11:32.606 --> 00:11:35.828]  You disagree with them on anything, it's a conspiracy theory.
[00:11:35.828 --> 00:11:40.649]  You don't like socialism, that's code for racism.
[00:11:40.649 --> 00:11:41.570]  This is tyranny.
[00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:43.691]  Don't you people understand it?
[00:11:43.691 --> 00:11:51.213]  Yes, I know most of the listeners do, but new listeners may not understand it.
[00:11:51.213 --> 00:11:55.275]  The banks are just getting started.
[00:11:55.275 --> 00:11:57.156]  Meanwhile, the media is only reporting on
[00:11:58.283 --> 00:12:04.346]  A Stewart man, 38, identified as a kite surfer killed by sharks off Stewart Beach.
[00:12:04.346 --> 00:12:11.370]  I guess we better have a five-day waiting period on swimming then, because if one person could die, we've got to ban it.
[00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:12.810]  You know, if there's 152 deaths,
[00:12:15.968 --> 00:12:25.555]  In 2008 in France, because of husbands and wives arguing with each other out of 61 million people, why not arrest anybody that raises their voice?
[00:12:25.555 --> 00:12:31.199]  Or if it'll save one child, why not just end the family, have the government raise all the children?
[00:12:31.199 --> 00:12:37.184]  Then it doesn't matter, though, when they hurt the children.
[00:12:37.184 --> 00:12:38.865]  Eustace Mullins passes on
[00:12:43.427 --> 00:12:49.732]  Probably deserves more credit than anybody else for really exposing the private Federal Reserve System.
[00:12:49.732 --> 00:12:51.994]  Myron Fagan, as well.
[00:12:51.994 --> 00:12:54.656]  I guess those two men, now part of history.
[00:12:54.656 --> 00:12:56.517]  But their work will continue on.
[00:12:56.517 --> 00:13:00.320]  If I have time later, I'm going to play a few clips from interviews I've had with Useless Mullins.
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:09.467]  We have another icon of exposing the New World Order and the private banking system, Red Beckman, joining us.
[00:13:09.467 --> 00:13:11.449]  Coming up in the next hour today.
[00:13:15.982 --> 00:13:25.067]  Senate passes AIPAC-sponsored Iran Sanctions Act, which is really an act of war against Iran as they heat that up.
[00:13:25.067 --> 00:13:27.388]  Justice defends ruling on finance.
[00:13:27.388 --> 00:13:33.171]  Clarence Thomas on Tuesday vigorously defended the Supreme Court's recent campaign finance decision that
[00:13:34.207 --> 00:13:37.470]  Even foreign corporations can give unlimited amounts of money.
[00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:43.394]  You know, I would have agreed if the court would have said, you can't ban a film criticizing Hillary Clinton.
[00:13:43.394 --> 00:13:45.036]  That's the case they heard.
[00:13:45.036 --> 00:13:50.520]  But they found in the case that corporations, including foreign corporations, can do whatever they want.
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:56.025]  But the way I read the ruling, and that was now a week and a half ago, the media is now confirming my analysis,
[00:13:57.472 --> 00:14:02.735]  That it still restricts down to $3,000 what individuals can give.
[00:14:02.735 --> 00:14:04.076]  How do you like that?
[00:14:04.076 --> 00:14:10.239]  Foreign corporations can give whatever they want, but you, a citizen, can't.
[00:14:10.239 --> 00:14:11.260]  You're just a milk cow.
[00:14:12.495 --> 00:14:14.316]  A Prison Planet article.
[00:14:14.316 --> 00:14:14.637]  U.S.
[00:14:14.637 --> 00:14:19.480]  Treasury official openly serves on council of Rothschild-founded Earth Bank.
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:20.161]  Senior U.S.
[00:14:20.161 --> 00:14:33.391]  Treasury Department official William Fizer, the current Deputy Assistant Secretary for Environment and Energy, is simultaneously sitting council member on the Global Environmental Facility.
[00:14:34.594 --> 00:14:39.857]  Well, it's plagued by controversy and infighting, because you're going to have COINTELPRO in there, but more importantly,
[00:15:05.148 --> 00:15:14.479]  You've got Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin who've basically taken over the Tea Party movement created by the Ron Paul revolution.
[00:15:14.479 --> 00:15:20.265]  Who are anti-war, anti-corporate welfare, anti-big government.
[00:15:20.265 --> 00:15:25.832]  Ladies and gentlemen, all you need to know about Sarah Palin is that she was picked by John McCain.
[00:15:27.418 --> 00:15:29.779]  That's all you need to know about her.
[00:15:29.779 --> 00:15:40.142]  And you'll find out down the road, those of you that are snookered and those of you that have been bamboozled and conned by it, just like people that supported Obama, you've now found out, most of you.
[00:15:40.142 --> 00:15:45.523]  Still a few of you are idiotically drinking the Kool-Aid.
[00:15:45.523 --> 00:15:49.044]  So we'll be breaking that down as well.
[00:15:49.044 --> 00:15:51.685]  Also, stocks tumble on worries about labor market.
[00:15:53.251 --> 00:15:58.794]  We're going to be going over what's really happening as initial findings for jobless claims rise.
[00:15:58.794 --> 00:16:04.118]  Investors brace for monthly jobs report.
[00:16:04.118 --> 00:16:07.380]  It is all coming up today.
[00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:10.041]  And then I have a story here under the Mail newspaper.
[00:16:10.041 --> 00:16:12.943]  It says, child care Chinese style.
[00:16:12.943 --> 00:16:17.166]  Rickshaw driver chains two-year-old son to post while he's at work.
[00:16:19.502 --> 00:16:21.464]  And the government has no problem with it.
[00:16:21.464 --> 00:16:31.753]  Millions of Chinese chain their children or tie them to lampposts or to trees for their daycare.
[00:16:31.753 --> 00:16:35.036]  And then they simply use the bathroom on the street.
[00:16:35.036 --> 00:16:46.446]  Now, how are we going to compete with China with no environmental standards, no carbon taxes, no regulations, toxic waste is dumped directly into the rivers,
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:53.728]  They're coal plants, don't have scrubbers on them, nothing.
[00:16:53.728 --> 00:17:02.380]  Well, how they deal with it is shut down our power plants that are clean, almost completely clean with much of the new technology.
[00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:06.991]  And then move it all to China with unlimited pollution.
[00:17:06.991 --> 00:17:12.052]  And then if a parent is seen yelling at their child, CPS tries to take them.
[00:17:12.052 --> 00:17:22.935]  In England, a member of Parliament on a few days ago, out of 1,000 children taken in court, for every 1,000 cases, 997 are taken.
[00:17:22.935 --> 00:17:27.456]  Three out of 1,000 times the secretive kangaroo court
[00:17:35.481 --> 00:17:36.922]  Rules that you get to keep your children.
[00:17:36.922 --> 00:17:38.724]  So you got three chances out of a thousand.
[00:17:38.724 --> 00:17:41.306]  And it's pretty similar to that here in the U.S.
[00:17:41.306 --> 00:17:55.477]  And in many of the cases, if the husband yells at the woman, or she yells at him, everybody's been trained to then call the police even for yelling, and then they come, and even if you get a divorce from the evil husband that yelled or whatever, then you still can't have your children.
[00:17:55.477 --> 00:18:01.722]  The women are finding out real fast, so now the government wants to put, and is putting, cameras in all the new parents' homes.
[00:18:01.722 --> 00:18:02.722]  Guilty until proven innocent.
[00:18:03.803 --> 00:18:12.527]  So in China, you just chain your kid to the side of the highway, and the government says, yes, that's the child care in China.
[00:18:12.527 --> 00:18:14.808]  We've got to out-compete everybody.
[00:18:14.808 --> 00:18:20.911]  And then our government says, if you yell at your kid, we're going to take him, even though there's no law.
[00:18:20.911 --> 00:18:25.112]  And no wonder all the factories are shutting down, you're losing your jobs.
[00:18:25.112 --> 00:18:33.216]  But don't worry, you're losing your jobs, record joblessness, states going bankrupt left and right, officially bankrupt, and that doesn't matter.
[00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:40.998]  Because all over the country, cities and counties and states are putting taxes on food!
[00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:45.232]  First it was just going to be fattening food and soft drinks.
[00:18:45.232 --> 00:18:47.453]  Now it's everything.
[00:18:47.453 --> 00:18:49.334]  And see, that's what England's proposing.
[00:18:49.334 --> 00:18:51.555]  In fact, they're already putting it in many areas of Europe.
[00:18:51.555 --> 00:18:59.059]  A tax on every can of corn, every can of beans, every head of lettuce, every steak, every chicken.
[00:18:59.059 --> 00:19:00.000]  Everything.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:00.960]  Taxes.
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:02.341]  Carbon taxes.
[00:19:02.341 --> 00:19:04.702]  Austin's proposing carbon taxes.
[00:19:04.702 --> 00:19:06.083]  On bottled water.
[00:19:06.083 --> 00:19:07.364]  On meat.
[00:19:07.364 --> 00:19:09.165]  San Francisco's already put it in.
[00:19:12.725 --> 00:19:14.146]  They don't want you wealthy.
[00:19:14.146 --> 00:19:15.427]  They don't want you middle class.
[00:19:15.427 --> 00:19:16.969]  They don't even want you poor.
[00:19:16.969 --> 00:19:24.995]  They're going to bankrupt you, and then the police are going to come with the CPS, and they're going to take your kids, just like North Korea.
[00:19:24.995 --> 00:19:26.837]  And you'll never even really pay attention.
[00:19:26.837 --> 00:19:30.120]  Oh yeah, a lot of the kids are now in government hands, but that's freedom!
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:32.882]  That's land of the free, home of the brave!
[00:19:32.882 --> 00:19:34.563]  You want to live in an organized society?
[00:19:35.711 --> 00:19:36.672]  You want to be a slave?
[00:19:36.672 --> 00:19:39.054]  You want a secret police officer in every corner?
[00:19:39.054 --> 00:19:42.498]  Telling you what to think, what to say, what to wear, what to do?
[00:19:42.498 --> 00:19:51.306]  To quote Tony Montana?
[00:19:51.306 --> 00:19:53.568]  I'll tell you right now, folks.
[00:19:53.568 --> 00:19:57.572]  Americans don't know what is about to happen to them.

[00:20:00.632 --> 00:20:02.514]  How would you feel with normal blood pressure?
[00:20:02.514 --> 00:20:05.756]  How would you feel with a normal cholesterol reading without the drugs?
[00:20:05.756 --> 00:20:07.638]  What if you could avoid bypass surgery?
[00:20:07.638 --> 00:20:10.160]  Would it not be nice to have your heartbeat regularly again?
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:11.701]  To have a sex life again?
[00:20:11.701 --> 00:20:17.086]  All these benefits and more can be yours when your body heals itself with the assistance of Heart and Body Extract.

[00:20:42.461 --> 00:20:45.543]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:20:45.543 --> 00:20:47.884]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:20:47.884 --> 00:20:49.665]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:21:11.187 --> 00:21:13.868]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:21:13.868 --> 00:21:20.249]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:21:20.249 --> 00:21:25.790]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:35.412]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:21:35.552 --> 00:21:37.894]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:21:37.894 --> 00:21:39.475]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:21:39.475 --> 00:21:41.938]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:21:41.938 --> 00:21:43.799]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:21:43.799 --> 00:21:49.224]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:21:49.224 --> 00:21:58.332]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:22:00.248 --> 00:22:10.276]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[00:22:10.276 --> 00:22:16.721]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[00:22:16.721 --> 00:22:25.568]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[00:22:25.948 --> 00:22:35.133]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[00:22:35.133 --> 00:22:39.736]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[00:22:39.736 --> 00:22:41.537]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:41.537 --> 00:22:44.038]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.
[00:22:44.318 --> 00:22:47.642]  Call me today at 800-686-2237.

[00:22:52.728 --> 00:22:53.088]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[00:23:00.185 --> 00:23:03.728]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[00:23:03.728 --> 00:23:06.030]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:06.891]  Don't!
[00:23:06.891 --> 00:23:10.333]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[00:23:10.333 --> 00:23:17.459]  Why pay, when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[00:23:17.439 --> 00:23:19.421]  's number one debt secret.
[00:23:19.421 --> 00:23:23.504]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[00:23:23.504 --> 00:23:26.207]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[00:23:26.627 --> 00:23:33.996]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[00:23:33.996 --> 00:23:35.197]  Herb K was right.
[00:23:35.197 --> 00:23:38.381]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[00:23:38.381 --> 00:23:39.722]  What have you got to lose?
[00:23:39.722 --> 00:23:42.866]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money!
[00:23:43.426 --> 00:23:46.747]  Get Herb K's number one debt secret absolutely free now!
[00:23:46.747 --> 00:23:47.367]  Call 888-352-7726.
[00:23:47.367 --> 00:23:47.807]  That's 888-352-7726.
[00:23:47.807 --> 00:23:47.847]  888-352-7726.
[00:24:06.849 --> 00:24:19.836]  Since I mentioned at the start of the radio broadcast that the megacity of Phoenix is going to start taxing food at 2% and then of course jack it up, they're already talking about that.
[00:24:19.836 --> 00:24:23.318]  The income tax started at 1% and now it's going up to 40%.
[00:24:23.318 --> 00:24:31.022]  And then I've got these Twitter comments coming in saying food has always been taxed in Chicago area.
[00:24:32.308 --> 00:24:34.609]  Usually at a lower rate than other goods.
[00:24:34.609 --> 00:24:35.969]  But we've always been taxed.
[00:24:35.969 --> 00:24:37.709]  Well, see, there you go.
[00:24:37.709 --> 00:24:40.510]  Throughout history, you never tax food.
[00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:42.351]  That hits the poorest.
[00:24:42.351 --> 00:24:47.432]  But they're going to tax your food, and they're going to do it for environmental reasons.
[00:24:47.432 --> 00:24:48.772]  Oh, yes.
[00:24:48.772 --> 00:24:49.872]  It's for the Earth.
[00:24:49.872 --> 00:24:51.753]  Humans eating food is bad.
[00:24:53.286 --> 00:24:58.789]  Desperate to save police, fire, and other city jobs.
[00:24:58.789 --> 00:25:00.350]  That's an old trick.
[00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:09.115]  Cities always don't buy new radios or ambulances or won't fill the potholes until they've paid the bankers all their money and given themselves pay raises.
[00:25:09.115 --> 00:25:11.396]  And I've seen the statistics in the last year.
[00:25:11.396 --> 00:25:13.317]  Government pay rates go up and up and up.
[00:25:13.777 --> 00:25:16.618]  The government sector is growing, growing, growing.
[00:25:16.618 --> 00:25:19.280]  The private sector is shrinking, shrinking, shrinking.
[00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:27.083]  And the government sector is arming, arming, arming, and surveilling, surveilling, and spying on their slaves.
[00:25:27.083 --> 00:25:28.244]  It's slavery.
[00:25:28.244 --> 00:25:30.685]  You don't own your property, you pay property taxes.
[00:25:30.685 --> 00:25:34.147]  And that's going up and up and up.
[00:25:34.147 --> 00:25:35.387]  Phoenix gives OK to 2% tax on food.
[00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:49.585]  Desperate to save police, fire, and other city jobs, a divided Phoenix City Council on Tuesday approved a sales tax on grocery items that will generate tens of millions of dollars a year.
[00:25:49.585 --> 00:25:52.028]  The 2% food tax will take effect April 1st.
[00:25:52.028 --> 00:25:53.790]  Ah, for the April fools!
[00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:55.593]  Another little joke on the slaves.
[00:25:58.166 --> 00:26:07.671]  A tax on milk, meat, vegetables, and other food purchased by shoppers will generate an estimated $12.5 million for the fiscal year that ends June 30th.
[00:26:07.671 --> 00:26:11.913]  It will raise another $50 million for fiscal year 2011.
[00:26:11.913 --> 00:26:16.355]  Food purchases with food stamps will not be taxed.
[00:26:16.355 --> 00:26:24.159]  So they will tax everybody else, and then you'll be so bankrupt you go get food stamps from them, then you get CPS visits, and they get to take your children.
[00:26:25.083 --> 00:26:36.110]  The extra tax revenue means Phoenix will have more money in its coffers to help close the $241 million general fund budget deficit through June 2011.
[00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:50.338]  And Craig just brought me all of the different cities and states that tax food.
[00:26:50.338 --> 00:26:51.179]  My gosh!
[00:26:53.456 --> 00:26:55.497]  It is going in everywhere.
[00:26:55.497 --> 00:27:08.300]  It says Arkansas Taxes Food, Georgia Taxes Food, Illinois Taxes Food, Missouri Taxes Food, North Carolina Taxes Food.
[00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:12.501]  This is from taxadmin.org.
[00:27:12.501 --> 00:27:18.843]  Utah Taxes Food, Tennessee Taxes Food, Virginia Taxes Food.
[00:27:18.843 --> 00:27:19.923]  The list goes on and on.
[00:27:19.923 --> 00:27:20.903]  I didn't even know this.
[00:27:20.903 --> 00:27:22.504]  I guess you learn something every day, huh?
[00:27:23.786 --> 00:27:24.766]  West Virginia.
[00:27:24.766 --> 00:27:26.807]  Notice all the poorest states are doing it.
[00:27:26.807 --> 00:27:38.429]  I didn't know Wyoming taxed it.
[00:27:38.429 --> 00:27:42.750]  Wait, this has an asterisk by those states.
[00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:44.691]  So most of the states are exempt.
[00:27:44.691 --> 00:27:49.012]  The point is, they are raising taxes on every front.
[00:27:50.885 --> 00:27:52.807]  And they don't care if you're losing your job.
[00:27:52.807 --> 00:27:54.648]  They don't care if your insurance is out.
[00:27:54.648 --> 00:27:55.869]  You're going to jail for it.
[00:27:55.869 --> 00:27:59.753]  But if you're an illegal alien, you're above the law.
[00:27:59.753 --> 00:28:03.536]  800 plus cities are sanctuary cities where I live.
[00:28:03.536 --> 00:28:05.978]  People say, oh, don't be mean to the immigrants.
[00:28:05.978 --> 00:28:13.765]  But I, as a citizen, will be given a ticket or arrested.
[00:28:13.765 --> 00:28:14.786]  The police admit it.
[00:28:16.997 --> 00:28:25.223]  I saw Associated Press articles where when ICE arrests illegal aliens, they take them to government job fairs and give most of them government jobs and green cards.
[00:28:25.223 --> 00:28:27.345]  I mean, this is a joke.
[00:28:27.345 --> 00:28:34.230]  And I've noticed this for a long time, but now we're seeing bonafide, massive evidence that it's coordinated.
[00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:40.835]  It isn't just we have foreigners like Schwarzenegger ruling over us in California.
[00:28:40.835 --> 00:28:44.498]  But the police departments are recruiting immigrants.
[00:28:45.697 --> 00:28:48.879]  They are recruiting foreigners to be CPS workers.
[00:28:48.879 --> 00:28:51.100]  It's the same in Europe and England.
[00:28:51.100 --> 00:29:00.586]  We are a country ruled by foreigners, ruled by criminals, ruled by parasitic foreign banks, and they're just bringing in foreign mercs.
[00:29:00.586 --> 00:29:09.431]  I remember 10 years ago getting on air and reading mainstream news articles where the military was hiring illegal aliens and now felons and people can't even believe it.
[00:29:09.431 --> 00:29:14.474]  And I have associated press articles as well where city police departments are hiring illegal aliens.
[00:29:15.851 --> 00:29:18.794]  Because they will do what they're told!
[00:29:18.794 --> 00:29:20.556]  They have no history of freedom.
[00:29:20.556 --> 00:29:21.898]  They come from corrupt countries.
[00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:31.085]  They had NLE09 last year, where troops from 14 countries practiced, quote, taking on American terrorists.
[00:29:31.085 --> 00:29:37.671]  Major police departments under FEMA grants and Homeland Security are taking over the Boy Scouts and openly training them to, quote, take on disgruntled vets.
[00:29:37.671 --> 00:29:40.533]  We have the Homeland Security MIAC reports.
[00:29:40.533 --> 00:29:50.861]  America better wake up to just how bad it is, and Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin and Barack Obama aren't going to tell you, because they're all in on it together.
[00:29:50.861 --> 00:29:52.263]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.263 --> 00:29:53.764]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.766 --> 00:29:57.464]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.025 --> 00:30:05.986]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:30:05.986 --> 00:30:14.868]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:30:14.868 --> 00:30:19.489]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:30:19.489 --> 00:30:30.311]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:30:30.931 --> 00:30:40.453]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:30:40.453 --> 00:30:45.875]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:30:45.875 --> 00:30:53.356]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:30:53.356 --> 00:30:55.777]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:31:01.977 --> 00:31:06.004]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:31:06.004 --> 00:31:09.250]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:10.673]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:31:11.371 --> 00:31:14.054]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:31:14.054 --> 00:31:20.440]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:25.504]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:31:25.504 --> 00:31:35.634]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:31:35.734 --> 00:31:38.075]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:31:38.075 --> 00:31:39.676]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:31:39.676 --> 00:31:42.118]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:31:42.118 --> 00:31:44.259]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:31:44.259 --> 00:31:49.403]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:31:49.403 --> 00:31:54.406]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[00:31:54.406 --> 00:31:58.588]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:32:00.612 --> 00:32:04.115]  Attention gardeners, this is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[00:32:04.115 --> 00:32:08.638]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers, and herbs.
[00:32:08.638 --> 00:32:16.524]  It's called Proto-Gro, and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[00:32:16.844 --> 00:32:19.967]  Now, here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[00:32:19.967 --> 00:32:27.594]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[00:32:27.594 --> 00:32:33.419]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys, which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[00:32:33.419 --> 00:32:39.265]  Proto-Gro's full-spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[00:32:39.265 --> 00:32:42.508]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[00:32:42.788 --> 00:32:46.390]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[00:32:46.390 --> 00:32:51.454]  GCN listeners who want to grow Dirt Chief superfoods should visit the Proto-Gro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[00:32:51.454 --> 00:32:54.336]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[00:32:54.336 --> 00:32:54.536]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:33:13.371 --> 00:33:14.631]  Again and again.
[00:33:14.631 --> 00:33:20.793]  Coming straight on for the Tyrants.
[00:33:20.793 --> 00:33:29.314]  Alright, I'm going to open the phones up right now.
[00:33:46.715 --> 00:33:55.958]  For listeners that want to specifically talk about food taxes and states like California and Pennsylvania effectively bankrupt.
[00:33:55.958 --> 00:34:02.779]  But don't worry, the banks will loan the states more of our own money to then pay it back as interest to the banks.
[00:34:02.779 --> 00:34:04.220]  They get it coming and going.
[00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:04.360]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:04.420]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:34:22.349 --> 00:34:24.610]  Here's some of the other news I have.
[00:34:24.610 --> 00:34:29.071]  Notice as the taxes all go up, the supposed services all get cut.
[00:34:29.071 --> 00:34:36.473]  Because most of the money now goes to the bankers and interest, just like Nigeria, or Brazil, or Argentina.
[00:34:36.473 --> 00:34:39.674]  We have been enslaved through fraud by the Ponzi scheme.
[00:34:40.939 --> 00:34:53.628]  And don't try to say no to the fraud, because the paramilitary police and military have now been forged into a weapon to carry out the fraud and enforce the fraud, but they are beginning to wake up.
[00:34:53.628 --> 00:35:02.075]  Here's another story out of the news of azcentral.com out of the Arizona Republic.
[00:35:03.507 --> 00:35:06.193]  President proposes cutting Border Patrol.
[00:35:06.193 --> 00:35:07.857]  Oh yes, going to cut that.
[00:35:07.857 --> 00:35:14.130]  He has spent more money than all presidents before him combined, back to George Washington, but he will cut that Border Patrol.
[00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:21.672]  President Barack Obama's proposed 2011 budget would cut the Border Patrol by 180 agents.
[00:35:21.672 --> 00:35:31.516]  They already don't let them do their job and have them pick up garbage on the side of the road and trim spending on a virtual fence along the nation's southwest border, which they never even built but small parts of.
[00:35:31.516 --> 00:35:36.238]  Homeland Security's officials confirmed the proposed cuts money during a budget briefing for reporters.
[00:35:36.238 --> 00:35:38.619]  They said no border agents would lose their jobs.
[00:35:38.619 --> 00:35:41.420]  Instead, the positions would be cut through attrition.
[00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:43.020]  Oh, yes.
[00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:44.141]  As the agents retire.
[00:35:45.273 --> 00:35:47.994]  And then here's another eugenics article from RT.
[00:35:47.994 --> 00:35:52.015]  Journalist calls for euthanasia of disabled newborns.
[00:35:52.015 --> 00:35:57.516]  And then, already in England, if you have a learning disability, they don't let you have children or they take them.
[00:35:57.516 --> 00:36:02.598]  Well, now they'll just kill you because they're loving the government's nice.
[00:36:02.598 --> 00:36:06.699]  The article titled, Finish it off so it doesn't suffer.
[00:36:06.699 --> 00:36:06.759]  It.
[00:36:08.581 --> 00:36:13.045]  You notice all these people that want to kill humans always that were animal rights activists.
[00:36:13.045 --> 00:36:20.513]  They do that so they can take your human capacity to care for other humans that have empathy and they place it onto animals.
[00:36:20.513 --> 00:36:21.534]  It's all psych warfare.
[00:36:23.103 --> 00:36:38.126]  The article titled, Finish It Off So It Doesn't Suffer, which calls for the euthanasia of disabled newborn children, has caused public outrage in Russia and has led to fierce debates in the blogging community.
[00:36:38.126 --> 00:36:45.748]  In the article under question, the author says that the killing of the newborn is in fact the same as abortion or super late-term abortion.
[00:36:45.748 --> 00:36:47.768]  Well, that's what Obama has said.
[00:36:47.768 --> 00:36:52.069]  That's what Peter Singer says at Princeton and calls disabled newborns
[00:36:53.669 --> 00:36:57.131]  Defective blanks and newborn idiots.
[00:36:57.131 --> 00:37:02.434]  He states that depriving disabled infants of life is true humanism.
[00:37:02.434 --> 00:37:09.618]  The Union of Russian Journalists has accused the author of the article, it's a scientific article, of breaching professional ethics.
[00:37:09.618 --> 00:37:19.224]  The Union board criticism comes from the fact that instead of discussing the right for free choice of disabled newborns' fate, the author claims the only rational way is to deprive them of life,
[00:37:19.924 --> 00:37:23.666]  Then, of course, they'll have to be pre-screening to make sure mommy's not going to have one.
[00:37:23.666 --> 00:37:27.668]  And then forced abortion, as China proposed at Copenhagen two months ago.
[00:37:27.668 --> 00:37:34.592]  The board concluded the articles entrenches upon extremism.
[00:37:34.592 --> 00:37:37.994]  The author is not raising a disabled child.
[00:37:37.994 --> 00:37:42.937]  That is why he generalized conclusions about the life of disabled people and their families.
[00:37:48.325 --> 00:37:51.627]  And it goes on from there.
[00:37:51.627 --> 00:37:57.391]  Now that's the type of news I have here in front of me.
[00:37:57.391 --> 00:38:06.957]  And notice when government commits crimes against humanity, or uses DU, killing our own soldiers and maiming and hurting others, it's okay and let's not talk about it.
[00:38:06.957 --> 00:38:15.662]  But, oh, did a parent yell at their child, we've got to take them, we're the government, we want to take care of everybody.
[00:38:20.657 --> 00:38:22.739]  We're going to go to your phone calls right now.
[00:38:22.739 --> 00:38:37.870]  Red Beckman is coming up to talk about tax time in a month and a half that we're accelerating towards, and who you really pay your taxes to, and his take on the state of the union.
[00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:39.491]  Dave in Canada, you're on the air.
[00:38:39.491 --> 00:38:41.173]  Hey Alex.
[00:38:41.173 --> 00:38:41.493]  Hey buddy.
[00:38:42.671 --> 00:38:45.014]  I am just calling about two things.
[00:38:45.014 --> 00:38:52.725]  Well, the Olympics are coming up and the harmonized sales tax that's being implemented in Ontario and Canada here.
[00:38:52.725 --> 00:38:58.613]  I'm wondering what you think about the risk of terrorism at the Olympics in Vancouver there.
[00:38:59.793 --> 00:39:07.856]  Well, I know that the White House has had its minions go speak before Congress, and they all went down the line.
[00:39:07.856 --> 00:39:12.878]  In fact, I want to play that clip later in the show, and said, we will be hit by terrorists.
[00:39:12.878 --> 00:39:14.258]  They're going to try to attack.
[00:39:14.258 --> 00:39:17.879]  It's a certainty in the next three to six months.
[00:39:17.879 --> 00:39:20.800]  But don't worry, they'll take all our rights and keep us safe from it.
[00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:25.502]  And all these other pundits saying they need a terror attack to get their new war with Iran going.
[00:39:26.806 --> 00:39:39.672]  So if you look at the political landscape, I think we're now entering the maximum danger period of staged terror attacks, and you couple that with the underwear Christmas Day villain, and that's clearly was staged.
[00:39:39.672 --> 00:39:45.134]  I mean, that's now in plain view admitted, but hasn't become a large news story.
[00:39:45.134 --> 00:39:46.395]  Yeah, definitely.
[00:39:46.395 --> 00:39:48.215]  Now tell me about taxes on food.
[00:39:48.215 --> 00:39:49.256]  Do you have that up in Canada?
[00:39:50.117 --> 00:39:54.684]  Well, we're going to be having a new tax coming up July 1st.
[00:39:54.684 --> 00:40:06.361]  The Harmonized Sales Tax are going to be combining... Yeah, it's basically a new tax on food and tax on everything, but the Harmonized Sales Tax are going to be combining the Provincial Sales Tax with the Government Sales Tax.
[00:40:07.065 --> 00:40:14.952]  So things that were previously only subject to government sales tax or the provincial sales tax, we're going to be combining both of them.
[00:40:14.952 --> 00:40:16.993]  Doubling it!
[00:40:16.993 --> 00:40:19.155]  Doubling the goodie looting.
[00:40:19.155 --> 00:40:22.158]  Well, and then it all goes under central control.
[00:40:22.158 --> 00:40:29.964]  All over the world, they're just passing taxes on food, taxes on water, taxes on energy, and they're not going to stop.
[00:40:29.964 --> 00:40:35.289]  They're going to squeeze and squeeze and drive you into the arms of your loving government
[00:40:35.529 --> 00:40:36.870]  Your euthanasia government.
[00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:38.852]  Thank you, Dave.
[00:40:38.852 --> 00:40:40.973]  Because there's too many of us, and we're living too well.
[00:40:40.973 --> 00:40:49.299]  I can't tell you how many times I've heard NPR, and I don't listen to it maybe once a week, scores of times I've heard them say, it's good our economy's falling apart.
[00:40:49.299 --> 00:40:50.620]  We've all seen the headlines.
[00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:52.542]  It's good for our carbon footprint.
[00:40:52.542 --> 00:40:54.223]  We've had it too well.
[00:40:54.223 --> 00:40:55.584]  We're gonna learn!
[00:40:55.584 --> 00:40:57.986]  The government's gonna learn us!
[00:40:57.986 --> 00:40:59.387]  Our authorities!
[00:40:59.387 --> 00:41:02.129]  Our officials!
[00:41:02.129 --> 00:41:04.251]  Briggs in Illinois, you're on the air.
[00:41:06.069 --> 00:41:09.511]  Hey Alex and crew, this is Captain Briggs with a home in Colleen, Texas.
[00:41:09.511 --> 00:41:13.254]  Right now I'm calling from my wife's house in Rockford, Illinois.
[00:41:13.254 --> 00:41:13.614]  Okay!
[00:41:13.614 --> 00:41:15.235]  A couple quick points.
[00:41:15.235 --> 00:41:19.358]  Um, 30 year veteran, mostly special ops.
[00:41:19.358 --> 00:41:20.658]  I got your back.
[00:41:20.658 --> 00:41:22.900]  Me and some other patriots.
[00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:30.585]  Uh, I'll be driving from Illinois back to Texas in time to vote for Debra Medina for Texas Governor.
[00:41:30.585 --> 00:41:33.907]  I'll be there to hopefully support you and y'all at the Austin Gun Show.
[00:41:35.447 --> 00:41:47.597]  And three, do a little recon between here in Illinois and back to Texas to see just what's going on as we continue our downward spiral and hopefully head back towards liberty and freedom.
[00:41:47.597 --> 00:41:54.823]  When you talk to your military buddies who are in or out of the military, are they really starting to wake up?
[00:41:54.823 --> 00:41:59.447]  Well, I'll tell you, I've got, with 30 years in, I've been all around the globe.
[00:41:59.447 --> 00:42:04.231]  Unfortunately, and in certain circumstances, I can't discuss them here, I've been an operator, if you know what I mean.
[00:42:06.484 --> 00:42:14.789]  So some of the stuff that y'all are talking about in the open media now, I'm part and parcel to.
[00:42:14.789 --> 00:42:18.671]  And it all comes back to credibility.
[00:42:18.671 --> 00:42:27.917]  The buddies that I've been talking to, and I've also reached out to some law enforcement officials as well, law enforcement agencies, personnel, they understand.
[00:42:27.917 --> 00:42:28.917]  They got a buddy.
[00:42:28.917 --> 00:42:29.858]  They're awake.
[00:42:29.858 --> 00:42:31.319]  They're just standing by, biding their time.
[00:42:32.265 --> 00:42:43.067]  So, what I would say to the people out there, you know, John Q. Public, is read your Constitution, review your Bill of Rights, stand ready, it's coming.
[00:42:43.067 --> 00:42:59.850]  Well, I do know that we've seen the national polls of 98% of police saying they're 100% pro-Second Amendment, and I do know that the military is on fire with awakening to the New World Order, but here's the problem.
[00:42:59.850 --> 00:43:00.370]  They are
[00:43:01.542 --> 00:43:07.026]  Replacing good police and military with foreigners and criminals as fast as they can.
[00:43:07.026 --> 00:43:13.391]  And admittedly, they've even had MSNBC specials about all the gangbangers they're hiring.
[00:43:13.391 --> 00:43:15.372]  I mean, does the military ever talk about that?
[00:43:15.372 --> 00:43:19.956]  That they're trying to bring in a gang of pirates to enforce for them?
[00:43:21.018 --> 00:43:27.984]  Well, I have firsthand knowledge of, I've seen entire companies of guys sporting gang, uh, gangbanging tattoos and whatnot.
[00:43:27.984 --> 00:43:35.491]  We had whole companies in Iraq from the company commander and the first sergeant all the way down that were made of specifically certain gangbangers.
[00:43:35.491 --> 00:43:40.235]  So yes, they have created these pockets of their, uh, you know, their thugs.
[00:43:40.235 --> 00:43:42.898]  However, I would submit to you, there are enough patriots out there.
[00:43:42.898 --> 00:43:45.420]  There are enough veterans out there and we know how to shoot.
[00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:47.482]  I grew up on a farm, so you know, I know how to shoot.
[00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:50.461]  Um, that'll take care of those thugs.
[00:43:50.461 --> 00:44:09.632]  And, uh, the people just need to remember, you know, getting back to the basics, um, the one thing that scares me, and I'm an anti-terrorism officer, I've spent a lot of time in the special ops community, the one thing that you've touched on here in the last couple weeks is the Olympics and our next false flag.
[00:44:09.632 --> 00:44:14.555]  And just like I was sitting at Fort Hood, Texas on the 11th of September, 2001, in a chemical unit,
[00:44:17.887 --> 00:44:21.128]  And I saw those twin towers, and I said, here we go.
[00:44:21.128 --> 00:44:22.589]  They've started it.
[00:44:22.589 --> 00:44:26.090]  So you were awake even back then?
[00:44:26.090 --> 00:44:32.513]  Sir, I'm like you, and I have watched your interview with Dean Hagelin.
[00:44:32.513 --> 00:44:39.056]  You know, I've been awake for a long time, but I've had to be quiet and just observe, take notes, and seek out other
[00:44:40.791 --> 00:44:53.520]  Like-minded, liberty-oriented folks, so when the time comes, we know who's on our left, we know who's on our right, we know who's behind us, and in front of us, and above us, and below us, so that we can protect, we need to protect for our families, for our children.
[00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:55.502]  So I've been away for a long time.
[00:44:55.502 --> 00:45:04.468]  I've gone into certain organizations just so I could get a look, feed a little recon, and maybe gain some credibility when somebody says, well, what do you know about the Freemasons?
[00:45:04.468 --> 00:45:05.329]  I am one.
[00:45:05.329 --> 00:45:06.970]  Well, what do you know about schoolteachers?
[00:45:06.970 --> 00:45:07.610]  I am one.
[00:45:07.610 --> 00:45:09.352]  Well, what do you know about combat veterans?
[00:45:09.352 --> 00:45:09.812]  I am one.
[00:45:10.134 --> 00:45:11.615]  What do you know about farm folks?
[00:45:11.615 --> 00:45:13.876]  I am one.
[00:45:13.876 --> 00:45:20.338]  So, you know, I say kudos to you and your staff there, your crew there, of getting the word out and trying to wake people up.
[00:45:20.338 --> 00:45:34.484]  And I just want to share with you, brother, that everywhere I go, and when you see a white man walking around in a cowboy hat and a kilt wearing an Obama Joker or a Join or Die InfoWars t-shirt, you've got some people turning their heads here.
[00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:44.066]  And I make it a point to mention Infowars.com or PrisonPlanetTV.com or Alex Jones' name at least a minimum 12 times a day.
[00:45:44.066 --> 00:45:45.607]  Well, God bless you, Briggs.
[00:45:45.607 --> 00:45:48.609]  Briggs, I appreciate your call and look forward to meeting you sometime.
[00:45:48.609 --> 00:45:50.771]  Take care.
[00:45:50.771 --> 00:46:00.278]  We are reaching millions of new people a month, and it does have the system very, very concerned, but we're only one operation against the New World Order.
[00:46:00.278 --> 00:46:02.519]  It is you out there, the listeners.
[00:46:02.519 --> 00:46:04.081]  You are the very front line.
[00:46:05.046 --> 00:46:05.747]  of this fight.
[00:46:05.747 --> 00:46:06.347]  Remember that.
[00:46:06.347 --> 00:46:22.480]  And every little thing you do, whether it's telling somebody about Infowars.com or the podcast or giving them a copy of a DVD or getting your neighbors together and going to city council and speaking out against new taxes, everything you do brings this new world order closer to its downfall.
[00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:32.789]  Because it's so outrageously criminal, it's so outrageously corrupt, it's so ridiculously fraudulent, that all we've got to do is point it out and stand up against it.
[00:46:34.090 --> 00:46:36.051]  Let's try to hurry through the calls here.
[00:46:36.051 --> 00:46:37.532]  Let's talk to Eddie in Wisconsin.
[00:46:37.532 --> 00:46:39.073]  Eddie, thanks for holding.
[00:46:39.073 --> 00:46:40.554]  Hi, it's Edie.
[00:46:40.554 --> 00:46:41.595]  Edie, I'm sorry, Edie.
[00:46:41.595 --> 00:46:42.675]  That's okay.
[00:46:42.675 --> 00:46:44.776]  I've got to get my computer screen closer.
[00:46:44.776 --> 00:46:45.837]  It's about 10 feet away.
[00:46:45.837 --> 00:46:47.938]  I tend to read it wrong.
[00:46:47.938 --> 00:46:48.619]  Go ahead.
[00:46:48.619 --> 00:46:50.660]  That's okay.
[00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:56.684]  One thing I guess I've been thinking about, when you mentioned about the peaceful revolution, that's what I look toward.
[00:46:56.684 --> 00:46:58.685]  I've been really encouraged by the
[00:46:59.574 --> 00:47:16.920]  Tea Party people and I was so glad you brought up about Debra Medina because I think she's an excellent example of the kind of person that should be running for office and what I'm encouraged by is the number of people who want to run for local office, run for governor.
[00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:25.283]  I have a friend who has a cousin who's running for governor of South Dakota who is, you know,
[00:47:26.528 --> 00:47:29.369]  Independent and not bought out by anybody.
[00:47:29.369 --> 00:47:31.390]  So these are the things that encourage me.
[00:47:31.390 --> 00:47:33.891]  And that's what I'm praying for.
[00:47:33.891 --> 00:47:40.774]  I get a little concerned about the people that are looking for a war.
[00:47:40.774 --> 00:47:42.394]  Because I don't think we need that.
[00:47:42.394 --> 00:47:49.117]  We need, if we're going to have the good people to be there, it's the middle class, good people that need to be in office.
[00:47:49.707 --> 00:48:00.910]  Well, we have to remember, the system continues to stage violent attacks against innocent groups so that they can have the pretext to enslave everybody and set up a control grid.
[00:48:02.017 --> 00:48:09.221]  At the same time, the fact that we are an armed population is one of the final big deterrents to accelerated tyranny.
[00:48:09.221 --> 00:48:11.802]  But they're still moving forward.
[00:48:11.802 --> 00:48:14.643]  And people have a right to defend themselves.
[00:48:14.643 --> 00:48:22.227]  But absolutely, it is the establishment that seeks to provocateur people into violence.
[00:48:22.227 --> 00:48:23.288]  E.D., I appreciate your call.
[00:48:23.288 --> 00:48:27.750]  Scott in Arizona, you're on the air.
[00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:28.410]  Hey there, Alex.
[00:48:28.410 --> 00:48:29.111]  How you doing?
[00:48:29.111 --> 00:48:29.831]  Hey Scott, go ahead.
[00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:31.421]  Yeah, I don't, you know,
[00:48:56.468 --> 00:48:58.651]  I don't know about that cracking the code information.
[00:48:58.651 --> 00:49:03.817]  I mean, I don't think there's any code where you show it's a fraud and then don't pay it.
[00:49:03.817 --> 00:49:04.998]  It's a criminal mafia.
[00:49:04.998 --> 00:49:05.939]  We got it in 1913.
[00:49:05.939 --> 00:49:11.305]  The income tax wasn't widely distributed until the mid-50s.
[00:49:11.305 --> 00:49:14.850]  And it is a fraud, but they enforce it criminally.
[00:49:16.264 --> 00:49:26.192]  Uh, just like there's no law against the Austin Gun Show, but the police shut it down and then lied and said that they didn't shut it down and now admit they did shut it down with a nuisance abatement, which is a fraud.
[00:49:26.192 --> 00:49:32.837]  Uh, but yeah, I mean, I am familiar with some of that and uh, there's a lot of
[00:49:34.073 --> 00:49:39.276]  Patriot mythology out there that gets people in a lot of trouble.
[00:49:39.276 --> 00:49:49.122]  The fact is, talk about Red Beckman, the income tax was never properly ratified, so it is illegal, it is a fraud.
[00:49:49.122 --> 00:49:51.723]  And so a lot of the stuff in Cracking the Code is real.
[00:49:51.723 --> 00:49:57.187]  And yes, the corporations that made it were, they're all exempt from the laws they give us, but still,
[00:49:58.228 --> 00:50:02.231]  A lot of people think, well then if it's not the law and it's a fraud, I'm not going to pay it.
[00:50:02.231 --> 00:50:03.032]  They don't care!
[00:50:03.032 --> 00:50:10.218]  I mean the IRS just bought a whole bunch more weapons, that's in the news, to go out and enforce on people.
[00:50:10.218 --> 00:50:10.998]  I mean they arrested
[00:50:13.292 --> 00:50:17.375]  Actually, I'd like to give you Peter Eric Hendrickson's phone number if I could.
[00:50:17.375 --> 00:50:20.677]  I'd like to ask that you have him on so that he can share his information.
[00:50:43.465 --> 00:50:43.886]  I love it.
[00:50:57.438 --> 00:50:58.419]  Great job!
[00:50:58.419 --> 00:50:59.660]  Great job, Scott.
[00:50:59.660 --> 00:51:00.981]  I'll look into some more.
[00:51:00.981 --> 00:51:02.782]  You may be new to freeze-dry foods.

[00:51:09.447 --> 00:51:11.228]  Welcome to the Freeze-Dry Guy.
[00:51:11.228 --> 00:51:13.650]  Okay, actually, we're more than just one guy.

[00:52:01.858 --> 00:52:05.880]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:09.121]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:52:09.121 --> 00:52:10.542]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:52:11.238 --> 00:52:13.900]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:52:13.900 --> 00:52:20.306]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:20.306 --> 00:52:25.510]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:35.498]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:52:35.598 --> 00:52:37.939]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:52:37.939 --> 00:52:39.540]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:42.001]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:42.001 --> 00:52:44.122]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:52:44.122 --> 00:52:49.265]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:52:49.265 --> 00:52:58.389]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:53:00.566 --> 00:53:03.950]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[00:53:03.950 --> 00:53:07.854]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[00:53:07.854 --> 00:53:11.578]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?

[00:53:44.309 --> 00:53:45.209]  We're good to go.
[00:54:24.785 --> 00:54:46.061]  Livin' on the road, my friend Was gonna keep you free and clean And now you wear your skin like iron And your breath as hard as kerosene Weren't your mama's only boy But her favorite one, it seems
[00:54:48.624 --> 00:54:56.067]  This is a lot bigger than the United States.
[00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:23.542]  The private banking cartel does what it wants, when it wants, where it wants.
[00:55:23.542 --> 00:55:26.183]  They have sucked our country dry.
[00:55:26.183 --> 00:55:30.825]  They have pumped us full of pro-war, New World Order propaganda.
[00:55:30.825 --> 00:55:34.346]  They have created and armed all our enemies.
[00:55:34.346 --> 00:55:39.147]  And they are now imploding our republic.
[00:55:39.147 --> 00:55:40.888]  We are going in to bondage.
[00:55:42.534 --> 00:55:51.756]  To the police, to the military, to the bureaucrats, you will be betrayed as well if you haven't already been betrayed.
[00:55:51.756 --> 00:55:58.517]  We either awaken and join against the New World Order or we die politically.
[00:55:58.517 --> 00:56:00.897]  Our liberty dies.
[00:56:00.897 --> 00:56:03.498]  Our freedom dies.
[00:56:03.498 --> 00:56:06.798]  Going back to your phone calls here.
[00:56:06.798 --> 00:56:08.518]  Let's talk to Ken in Michigan.
[00:56:08.518 --> 00:56:10.279]  Ken, you're on the air.
[00:56:10.279 --> 00:56:11.319]  Alex.
[00:56:11.319 --> 00:56:11.639]  Welcome.
[00:56:12.458 --> 00:56:13.999]  How you doing?
[00:56:13.999 --> 00:56:21.023]  You're a great American hero, and I really appreciate what you do.
[00:56:21.023 --> 00:56:22.044]  Spreading the word.
[00:56:22.044 --> 00:56:24.765]  That's right.
[00:56:24.765 --> 00:56:41.415]  One of the things I wanted to bring up is I live here near Detroit, Michigan, and there's areas that are just completely legal aliens now, and it really bothers me because
[00:56:42.488 --> 00:56:57.937]  It's like a war zone down here and all you see is Mexicans driving around in Cadillacs and I just don't know where the money's coming from.
[00:56:57.937 --> 00:57:01.479]  It's called consular matriculum and now Poland
[00:57:02.662 --> 00:57:09.145]  Venezuela and others are setting up embassies and missions, as they call them, in the U.S.
[00:57:09.145 --> 00:57:21.310]  to issue them because Mexico, for more than a decade, goes in and lobbies local cities and states to not follow law and to accept consula matricula.
[00:57:21.310 --> 00:57:23.571]  Then, they will give $100, $200, $300.
[00:57:23.571 --> 00:57:24.932]  I mean, they don't care.
[00:57:28.965 --> 00:57:37.516]  Fake IDs to one illegal alien inside the U.S., then Wells Fargo, Bank of America, they will then give you a bank account.
[00:57:37.516 --> 00:57:37.957]  With that...
[00:57:39.676 --> 00:57:41.937]  They get everything.
[00:57:41.937 --> 00:57:46.998]  And citizens, regardless of what color you are, you get nothing.
[00:57:46.998 --> 00:57:52.119]  And, I mean, I've got an employee here who worked at Austin Energy in customer service, and they had big meetings about it.
[00:57:52.119 --> 00:57:55.960]  Old ladies, $10 over, turn their power off, turn their gas off.
[00:57:55.960 --> 00:58:01.682]  The illegals, though, in the same house for four or five years, no one pays but once every six months.
[00:58:01.682 --> 00:58:02.782]  They turn their power off,
[00:58:03.692 --> 00:58:09.977]  A new matricula comes up, they pay the 250, they say, oh, someone else lives here now to get it turned on.
[00:58:09.977 --> 00:58:12.259]  I mean, it's above the law.
[00:58:12.259 --> 00:58:23.409]  So those illegal aliens, sir, most of them don't even have to work because they're pulling 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20 different welfare checks under different aliases.
[00:58:23.409 --> 00:58:25.550]  Now you know why they're driving new Cadillacs.
[00:58:25.550 --> 00:58:25.971]  You understand?
[00:58:26.531 --> 00:58:29.934]  Yup, you talk about fraud and, you know, talk about betrayal.
[00:58:29.934 --> 00:58:30.895]  I'll tell you what, stay there.
[00:58:30.895 --> 00:58:36.960]  We're going to get Red Beckman on at 8 after, but I'm going to come back and finish up with you, Ken, then Nick, and a few others.
[00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:42.464]  Red Beckman coming up, stay with us.
[00:58:42.464 --> 00:58:45.066]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.066 --> 00:58:48.269]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:51.630 --> 00:58:55.314]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:58:55.314 --> 00:58:58.897]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:58:58.897 --> 00:59:03.721]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:59:03.721 --> 00:59:10.107]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:59:10.107 --> 00:59:12.350]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:59:12.850 --> 00:59:13.170]  Tim Geithner?
[00:59:13.170 --> 00:59:13.690]  Bernanke?
[00:59:13.690 --> 00:59:14.351]  They're arsonists!
[00:59:14.351 --> 00:59:15.651]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:59:15.651 --> 00:59:17.892]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:59:31.778 --> 00:59:33.919]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:59:33.919 --> 00:59:39.040]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:59:39.040 --> 00:59:53.445]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:59:53.445 --> 00:59:55.826]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.826 --> 00:59:58.627]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.157 --> 01:00:09.979]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:09.979 --> 01:00:11.560]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:13.141]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.141 --> 01:00:17.302]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.302 --> 01:00:24.546]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.546 --> 01:00:27.327]  Well, Patriot icon, Red Batman,
[01:00:28.831 --> 01:00:35.914]  It was already scheduled for the show, but now he can comment on Patriot icon Eustace Mullins.
[01:00:35.914 --> 01:00:42.656]  He'll also talk about the New World Order Master Plan, his 50 years fighting it, and a lot more coming up.
[01:00:42.656 --> 01:00:44.036]  I just talked to him.
[01:00:44.036 --> 01:00:46.858]  He certainly has a comment on the illegals being above the law.
[01:00:46.858 --> 01:00:48.838]  I mean, talk about fraud.
[01:00:48.838 --> 01:00:51.619]  Talk about unjust weights and measures.
[01:00:51.619 --> 01:00:53.100]  It is fraud.
[01:00:53.100 --> 01:00:54.120]  They are above the law.
[01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:55.381]  They get all the free welfare.
[01:00:55.381 --> 01:00:56.301]  Citizens get nothing.
[01:00:57.674 --> 01:00:59.834]  Well, our standard of living implodes.
[01:00:59.834 --> 01:01:01.775]  Going back to Ken in Michigan.
[01:01:01.775 --> 01:01:03.235]  Ken, finish up your point.
[01:01:03.235 --> 01:01:16.897]  Well, I just, I've noticed all you have to do is, I'm not a big TV watcher, but all you have to do really is watch some of the police documentaries like First 48, Cop.
[01:01:16.897 --> 01:01:26.679]  All you see is a bunch of criminal Mexicans, probably most of them are illegal, and they're causing havoc, and nobody seems to care.
[01:01:29.199 --> 01:01:37.165]  Well, you know there's a hundred million people in Mexico, and criminals flee there and come here.
[01:01:37.165 --> 01:01:40.828]  It's a shame, you know, and they've been doing this for how long, Alex?
[01:01:40.828 --> 01:01:45.211]  I mean, when are people going to wake up?
[01:01:45.211 --> 01:01:50.835]  They have woken up, but the government, whether it's Republican or Democrat, is controlled by the New World Order.
[01:01:54.660 --> 01:01:57.944]  Yeah, they come at us from so many angles sometimes.
[01:01:57.944 --> 01:01:58.766]  It's just hard.
[01:01:58.766 --> 01:02:02.250]  I can't imagine, you know, how you deal with it all.
[01:02:02.250 --> 01:02:05.194]  Well, this is how I deal with it.
[01:02:05.194 --> 01:02:07.156]  This is how I deal with it, Ken.
[01:02:07.156 --> 01:02:11.102]  Things would be a thousand percent worse if people like
[01:02:12.423 --> 01:02:29.776]  Red Beckman and Bill Benson and G. Edward Griffin and Myron Fagan and Eustace Mullins and countless other people 30, 40, 50, 60 years ago hadn't been telling the truth.
[01:02:29.776 --> 01:02:32.217]  People like Gary Allen.
[01:02:33.322 --> 01:02:42.706]  People like Bob Chapman, they understood what was happening, they warned us, so other generations of people could wake up, and we grew slowly.
[01:02:42.706 --> 01:02:50.349]  But we are now, probably 30% of the population, and it took 3-5% to win the Revolutionary War.
[01:02:50.349 --> 01:02:52.490]  Look, 80% of the public wanted to be slaves.
[01:02:53.883 --> 01:02:54.884]  Okay?
[01:02:54.884 --> 01:03:01.751]  And another 17% or so supported the Patriots, but it was only about 3-5% that started it and won it.
[01:03:01.751 --> 01:03:03.412]  And so, we're in the right.
[01:03:03.412 --> 01:03:05.274]  We've got 30%.
[01:03:05.274 --> 01:03:10.239]  If the globalists don't go to full martial law in the next year, we'll have 50% another year or two.
[01:03:10.239 --> 01:03:11.800]  We are growing that fast.
[01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:16.284]  It's been a slow growth, but it's been exponential, and now it's doubling.
[01:03:17.365 --> 01:03:20.167]  And just expanding massively every few years.
[01:03:20.167 --> 01:03:22.269]  And we'll talk to Red Beckman about the mass awakening.
[01:03:22.269 --> 01:03:26.292]  And when we say mass awakening, folks, it is a mass awakening.
[01:03:26.292 --> 01:03:30.995]  And that's why they openly said they want to restrict and censor and have the UN take over the Internet.
[01:03:30.995 --> 01:03:32.396]  That's openly being announced.
[01:03:32.396 --> 01:03:35.239]  World government's openly being announced.
[01:03:35.239 --> 01:03:38.781]  They tried the game of denying any of this existed for decades.
[01:03:38.781 --> 01:03:40.382]  That doesn't work anymore.
[01:03:40.382 --> 01:03:44.065]  So now they say, oh, well, world government's good.
[01:03:44.065 --> 01:03:45.586]  So, Ken, that's why I
[01:03:47.535 --> 01:03:48.736]  Stay in the fight.
[01:03:48.736 --> 01:03:50.177]  I don't have a choice.
[01:03:50.177 --> 01:03:51.338]  There's nowhere to run.
[01:03:51.338 --> 01:03:52.560]  If there was some free country...
[01:03:53.701 --> 01:03:59.385]  I'd be just like my ancestors jumping on the Mayflower and coming to a new land to be free and left alone by government.
[01:03:59.385 --> 01:04:01.747]  There's nowhere to run.
[01:04:01.747 --> 01:04:03.328]  My roots are here.
[01:04:03.328 --> 01:04:04.509]  I'm cornered.
[01:04:04.509 --> 01:04:06.010]  I have nowhere to go.
[01:04:06.010 --> 01:04:06.911]  I've got to fight.
[01:04:06.911 --> 01:04:17.359]  And that's a powerful position, folks, when you've committed that you know there's nothing else you can do, and you realize you're going to die regardless, you might as well stand up and fight.
[01:04:17.359 --> 01:04:20.161]  And just commit to it, all of you.
[01:04:20.161 --> 01:04:21.702]  So, what do you think of them apples, Ken?
[01:04:22.688 --> 01:04:42.557]  Well you're about right on and I hope more people will wake up to what's going on and I try to wake up as many people as I can and I think we got a chance but we all need to band together and fight against the satanic Hitler wannabes.
[01:04:43.866 --> 01:04:44.667]  I hear you, my friend.
[01:04:44.667 --> 01:04:45.587]  I appreciate your call.
[01:04:45.587 --> 01:04:47.849]  In three minutes, we're back with Red Beckman.
[01:04:47.849 --> 01:04:49.971]  He'll be with us 20 minutes in the next hour.
[01:04:49.971 --> 01:04:51.071]  And yes, we'll open the phones.
[01:04:51.071 --> 01:04:52.973]  You can comment on any issue.
[01:04:52.973 --> 01:04:55.294]  Red Beckman, a real treasure.
[01:04:55.294 --> 01:04:55.795]  Straight ahead.
[01:05:00.635 --> 01:05:05.940]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:08.682]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[01:05:08.682 --> 01:05:14.026]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[01:05:14.026 --> 01:05:18.510]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from InfallWars.com.

[01:06:01.038 --> 01:06:04.040]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:09.385]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:06:09.385 --> 01:06:11.426]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:06:11.426 --> 01:06:16.430]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:06:16.430 --> 01:06:17.351]  How much do you want?
[01:06:17.591 --> 01:06:18.732]  When do you want it?
[01:06:18.732 --> 01:06:20.613]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:06:20.613 --> 01:06:21.674]  When will you need it?
[01:06:21.674 --> 01:06:23.875]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:06:23.875 --> 01:06:25.216]  Will there be any food?
[01:06:25.216 --> 01:06:26.757]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:06:26.757 --> 01:06:32.021]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:06:32.021 --> 01:06:35.603]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:06:35.603 --> 01:06:39.086]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:06:39.426 --> 01:06:40.647]  How much will you need?
[01:06:40.647 --> 01:06:41.548]  We don't know.
[01:06:41.548 --> 01:06:42.649]  How much do you want?
[01:06:42.649 --> 01:06:43.590]  All you can get.
[01:06:43.590 --> 01:06:44.691]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:06:44.691 --> 01:06:47.734]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[01:07:00.407 --> 01:07:01.568]  What's your home worth?
[01:07:01.568 --> 01:07:03.691]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[01:07:03.691 --> 01:07:06.735]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?

[01:08:00.997 --> 01:08:08.684]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:11.132 --> 01:08:15.433]  Brad Beckman, author of The Law That Never Was and Born Again Republic.
[01:08:15.433 --> 01:08:28.237]  Beckman is the founder of the Fully Informed Juries Association that is all over the United States and informs juries that they're the boss, not the corrupt judge or prosecutor.
[01:08:28.237 --> 01:08:37.680]  Beckman documented by going to all of the states that existed when we got the 16th Amendment for the Income Tax that it was never properly ratified.
[01:08:40.763 --> 01:08:46.285]  And he's going to be with us into the next hour, and we're very honored to have him with us.
[01:08:46.285 --> 01:08:48.206]  Red, thanks for coming on.
[01:08:48.206 --> 01:08:50.686]  Very good to be with you.
[01:08:50.686 --> 01:09:03.451]  For those that may not know who you are, we have a lot of new affiliates and listeners, encapsulate who you are, your awakening, and what you've seen over the last 50 years fighting this tyranny, and where you think we are today.
[01:09:04.676 --> 01:09:19.865]  Well, I think that when I really woke up to the fact that our government was not performing as it was supposed to, was while I was in the military, in the service during the Korean War.
[01:09:19.865 --> 01:09:26.470]  And I'd seen things happen that didn't make sense, and of course when I
[01:09:27.689 --> 01:09:30.771]  I got out of the service in December of 52.
[01:09:30.771 --> 01:09:48.042]  I tried to be involved in the political process and it took me a number of years to figure out that our vote on election day just didn't do the job as far as controlling our government.
[01:09:48.042 --> 01:09:52.365]  And so I had to do some studying and all and of course I discovered that
[01:09:53.455 --> 01:10:09.267]  Uh, our votes, uh, we have a three-vote system, not a one-vote system, uh, because we have learned to our sorrow that, uh, just, uh, electing people to Congress and such, uh, that we don't have the control that we should have.
[01:10:09.267 --> 01:10:22.438]  And the founders were wise men, and they put the grand jury system in, and they put the trial jury system in, and, uh, and both the grand jury and the trial jury had been in existence for centuries.
[01:10:23.578 --> 01:10:25.819]  Uh, prior to our war of independence.
[01:10:25.819 --> 01:10:34.263]  And so, I found that the juries had the power to nullify law.
[01:10:34.263 --> 01:10:37.504]  And that we, the people, are the sovereign.
[01:10:37.504 --> 01:10:41.506]  We're not the peons of government.
[01:10:41.506 --> 01:10:43.707]  We are to control government.
[01:10:43.707 --> 01:10:52.471]  And of course, the government controls the schools, the education process, they actually control the churches and the media.
[01:10:53.571 --> 01:11:12.582]  And you have hit it so hard over the years about how they are attacking our minds and trying to control our minds, and they do that by feeding us a lot of propaganda, a lot of lies, and so we have to overcome that.
[01:11:12.582 --> 01:11:21.327]  And today, we have an exciting situation going on in this country with all the tea parties, the Oath Keepers,
[01:11:22.220 --> 01:11:29.183]  Uh, the fully informed juries, uh, all these, uh, Sheriff Mac, all these things are happening right now.
[01:11:29.183 --> 01:11:34.526]  And of course, here I am at 81 years of age, and I'm getting to see all of this.
[01:11:34.526 --> 01:11:38.888]  I'm getting to enjoy, uh, what's happening.
[01:11:38.888 --> 01:11:49.393]  Uh, we the people, um, you know, the concept, the Declaration of Independence says that, uh, the government derives or just powers from the consent of the governed.
[01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:58.186]  Well, if they can tamper with the minds of the people, then they can derive unjust powers.
[01:11:58.186 --> 01:12:02.169]  They get unjust powers, and we the people pay the bills.
[01:12:02.169 --> 01:12:06.352]  And that's what has happened to us in this country.
[01:12:06.352 --> 01:12:12.756]  Too much of our power, the people power, has been transferred to government.
[01:12:12.756 --> 01:12:16.038]  Now, government isn't going to give that power back.
[01:12:16.038 --> 01:12:19.501]  They're not just going to give it back when we say we want our power back.
[01:12:20.619 --> 01:12:27.305]  They're a greedy bunch, and they will keep your power until we take it back.
[01:12:27.305 --> 01:12:33.670]  We have to take our power back, and boy, I'll tell ya, I'm seeing it happen.
[01:12:33.670 --> 01:12:40.596]  I'm seeing the things that are happening all across this country, and it's a real exciting time.
[01:12:41.727 --> 01:12:51.999]  In 1989, I wrote a little book, Walls and Our Minds, and I made the statement how Germany was the first country to be conquered by the Nazis.
[01:12:51.999 --> 01:12:56.105]  And, of course, Germany paid an awful price for letting an enemy within.
[01:12:57.409 --> 01:12:58.891]  I conquer the nation.
[01:12:58.891 --> 01:13:02.773]  They paid the price of World War II.
[01:13:02.773 --> 01:13:08.418]  The Russians, the Russian people, they had an enemy within, the Communists.
[01:13:08.418 --> 01:13:16.444]  And they suffered for about 75 years because they allowed an enemy within.
[01:13:16.444 --> 01:13:21.648]  And of course in 89 I wrote about how our government had become an enemy within.
[01:13:22.607 --> 01:13:28.370]  And that our future was somewhat cloudy.
[01:13:28.370 --> 01:13:43.716]  And here we are, 20 years later, and of course at that time I said that we would probably have an economic crash or meltdown and that would open the door and people would wake up.
[01:13:44.478 --> 01:13:48.401]  And so, Alex, we're seeing it, and what a thrill it is!
[01:13:48.401 --> 01:14:04.271]  But there's the added danger, though, that people are waking up, because now the enemy is trying to fully implode the country so they can control it, and robbing us of tens of trillions of dollars a year, and launching all these new wars in our name.
[01:14:04.271 --> 01:14:10.875]  And so it's good that people are waking up, but they should be, because we're in very, very dire straits.
[01:14:10.875 --> 01:14:13.037]  Red Beckman, from your 50 years of study,
[01:14:13.757 --> 01:14:15.158]  Who runs the New World Order?
[01:14:15.158 --> 01:14:16.639]  What is the New World Order?
[01:14:16.639 --> 01:14:18.060]  What is this system?
[01:14:18.060 --> 01:14:20.663]  How do the central banks get so much power?
[01:14:20.663 --> 01:14:28.449]  Well, I'll tell ya, every generation, every generation will always produce a certain number
[01:14:29.666 --> 01:14:34.307]  Of, well, some people call them mattoids.
[01:14:34.307 --> 01:14:45.511]  They're mental cripples who think that they are far superior to anybody else and that they have a, well, they used to call it the divine right of kings.
[01:14:45.511 --> 01:14:49.412]  And our generations are no different.
[01:14:49.412 --> 01:14:52.692]  I've seen three generations now at my age.
[01:14:52.692 --> 01:14:57.934]  We have these people show up and they really belong in mental institutions.
[01:14:59.326 --> 01:15:00.307]  But we don't.
[01:15:00.307 --> 01:15:13.973]  We end up following them because they usually have enough propaganda and such to where they line up enough suckers to believe what they are trying to tell you.
[01:15:13.973 --> 01:15:21.796]  And of course, over the history of our country, we've had some of these people always trying to get
[01:15:22.558 --> 01:15:24.179]  A central bank.
[01:15:24.179 --> 01:15:28.241]  And, of course, we've had a couple of presidents that said no.
[01:15:28.241 --> 01:15:32.123]  They understood how dangerous a central bank is.
[01:15:32.123 --> 01:15:39.386]  Well, in 1913, of course, we got the income tax and the 17th Amendment.
[01:15:39.386 --> 01:15:42.068]  We got the Federal Reserve Bank.
[01:15:42.068 --> 01:15:48.611]  Because we had about 30 million immigrants in this country.
[01:15:49.252 --> 01:15:59.381]  They had come from Western Europe and they hadn't really assimilated to the point where they understood our language, our political system, and all of that.
[01:15:59.381 --> 01:16:03.384]  And they were too easily manipulated.
[01:16:04.544 --> 01:16:09.667]  That's how Wilson became President of the United States, as far as I'm concerned.
[01:16:09.667 --> 01:16:11.607]  That's what happened.
[01:16:11.607 --> 01:16:15.369]  And of course, we have somewhat of a parallel today.
[01:16:15.369 --> 01:16:21.172]  We have so many of these immigrants, and so many of them are illegal.
[01:16:21.172 --> 01:16:30.076]  And as I told you before we went on the air, I had recently written an op-ed piece.
[01:16:31.262 --> 01:16:59.740]  And, uh, I told how that, uh, the Roe v. Wade decision, the abortion thing, those first people that lost their lives in, uh, in the abortion mills back there would now be 37, 38 years old in the prime of their life, of their productive life, and, uh, and we have now murdered over 50 million, and that's our workforce that we, we eliminated through the abortion thing.
[01:17:00.476 --> 01:17:03.937]  And the globalists in many of their own documents admit that was their plan.
[01:17:03.937 --> 01:17:12.160]  Kill off the Americans, bring in the foreigners, then they'll pull the lever for gun control, big government, everything, and it's now happening.
[01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:14.101]  Yep.
[01:17:14.101 --> 01:17:19.223]  There was that vacuum in our workforce, and they brought in all these illegals.
[01:17:20.161 --> 01:17:32.348]  And they want, they're working very hard to give them amnesty and of course they give them all our social security money, they give them all their free health care and everything and
[01:17:33.390 --> 01:17:37.273]  We, the people of this country, we're getting the short end of the stick.
[01:17:37.273 --> 01:17:46.840]  And we subsidize driving down our own wages and with the consular matricula, on record, they will give unlimited numbers of these to citizens.
[01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:55.427]  Now other countries are duplicating what Mexico's done to where they literally are godlike with all the identities they want, everything they want.
[01:17:55.427 --> 01:17:58.369]  It's a second set of rules designed to cripple the country.
[01:17:58.974 --> 01:18:00.295]  Absolutely.
[01:18:00.295 --> 01:18:01.616]  And by the way, that's not our opinion.
[01:18:01.616 --> 01:18:09.920]  We now have the head climatologist at NASA, we have Maury Strong, all of them saying the carbon tax is meant to destroy our society.
[01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:12.902]  They want to destroy us to make us dependent.
[01:18:12.902 --> 01:18:15.243]  Absolutely.
[01:18:15.243 --> 01:18:28.250]  But I'll tell you, with the numbers of people that we have involved, and of course the biggest thing of all, Alex, you remember in the Reagan years,
[01:18:30.217 --> 01:18:43.582]  It seemed like the Communists in Russia were a threat, and Reagan built up the military, President Reagan built up the military, and they called it détente.
[01:18:43.582 --> 01:18:44.782]  You remember that?
[01:18:44.782 --> 01:18:45.603]  Yes.
[01:18:45.603 --> 01:18:47.544]  Okay, that's what we've got.
[01:18:47.544 --> 01:18:57.988]  Now, some of the figures, we've got somewhere between 200 and 220 million of our American people that have armed themselves to the teeth.
[01:18:59.207 --> 01:18:59.889]  We have.
[01:18:59.889 --> 01:19:06.724]  They tell us that there were over 14 million weapons sold in the United States in 2009.
[01:19:08.587 --> 01:19:11.729]  This is, this is detente.
[01:19:11.729 --> 01:19:22.658]  We've got it right here in this country because... The people are voting and letting the New World Order know that this means war.
[01:19:22.658 --> 01:19:23.899]  Absolutely.
[01:19:23.899 --> 01:19:26.561]  We've drawn our line in the sand.
[01:19:26.561 --> 01:19:35.047]  And I'll tell you, the New World Order people that are really promoting it, they're running scared.
[01:19:35.047 --> 01:19:35.988]  They're running afraid.
[01:19:36.961 --> 01:19:48.265]  And, uh, you know, we've got, uh, Congress people and Senators and such like, uh, uh, Reid from, uh, Nevada and Pelosi from California.
[01:19:48.265 --> 01:19:51.466]  Uh, I don't think those people are sleeping too well right now.
[01:19:51.466 --> 01:19:52.947]  Stay there, absolutely.
[01:19:52.947 --> 01:19:56.968]  And Goldman Sachs is getting bodyguards and armaments against us.
[01:19:56.968 --> 01:19:59.689]  Red Beckman, icon of the Patriot movement, straight ahead.
[01:20:01.434 --> 01:20:06.056]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name of water filtration.

[01:22:03.007 --> 01:22:09.291]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:22:09.291 --> 01:22:13.473]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:22:13.473 --> 01:22:15.414]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:22:15.414 --> 01:22:15.594]  Mint,
[01:22:15.934 --> 01:22:17.815]  Demand is at an all-time high.
[01:22:17.815 --> 01:22:25.918]  The stage is being set for the re-emergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.

[01:24:18.715 --> 01:24:24.951]  We're going to simulcast coming up in the next segment at PrisonPlanet.TV for PrisonPlanet.TV viewers.
[01:24:31.980 --> 01:24:33.441]  Red Beckman is our guest.
[01:24:33.441 --> 01:24:35.902]  He founded the Fully Informed Jury Association.
[01:24:35.902 --> 01:24:44.827]  We have information on that in the Citizen Rule books that we put free in all the t-shirt, book, or DVD film orders at InfoWars.com.
[01:24:44.827 --> 01:24:50.970]  The power of the three votes, not just the one vote, can really bring down the globalists.
[01:24:50.970 --> 01:24:56.994]  That's why they're trying to move towards regional government's administrative law that trumps constitutional law.
[01:24:57.884 --> 01:25:00.227]  So we'll talk to Red Beckman about that and take your phone calls.
[01:25:00.227 --> 01:25:03.712]  In fact, he'll just be with us until the bottom of the next hour.
[01:25:03.712 --> 01:25:10.661]  Red, short segment, getting back to what you're saying, you have 14 million NICS instant checks last year.
[01:25:10.661 --> 01:25:12.483]  In just a month,
[01:25:13.869 --> 01:25:22.512]  And a few days there's been another three million people are accelerating how fast they're getting firearms.
[01:25:22.512 --> 01:25:25.333]  Obama's introduced all these anti-gun bills.
[01:25:25.333 --> 01:25:30.615]  Much of his administration openly calls for outright gun bans, but then they try the old tried and trusted
[01:25:31.095 --> 01:25:33.317]  Propaganda term of saying it's a conspiracy.
[01:25:33.317 --> 01:25:38.080]  We don't want your guns, but people are now finding out they're liars.
[01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:41.223]  It seems the system is using all its old lies.
[01:25:41.223 --> 01:25:45.986]  When they had air superiority and total media control, they don't anymore, Red.
[01:25:45.986 --> 01:25:48.548]  Absolutely.
[01:25:48.548 --> 01:25:54.933]  This day, Tom, I think we really need to use that.
[01:25:59.446 --> 01:26:05.189]  And send a message to the gang of thieves there in Washington, D.C.
[01:26:05.189 --> 01:26:09.172]  that, you know, we are onto what they're doing.
[01:26:09.172 --> 01:26:12.114]  We understand what they're trying to do.
[01:26:12.114 --> 01:26:15.956]  And they have to have our power.
[01:26:15.956 --> 01:26:20.018]  They have to be able to tap into our power.
[01:26:20.018 --> 01:26:22.420]  And they're losing that.
[01:26:22.420 --> 01:26:23.901]  We're taking our power back.
[01:26:25.163 --> 01:26:36.494]  I think we're going to be able to destroy the tax court simply by pointing out the fact that federal judges are federal agents.
[01:26:36.494 --> 01:26:44.463]  They are government agents and they can't make findings of fact and conclusions of law because they have a conflict of interest.
[01:26:45.357 --> 01:26:51.922]  And so this is just one of the things, the good news items that are coming down.
[01:26:51.922 --> 01:27:06.212]  And of course, our yesterday paper just threw me to death because I'm out here in the state of Washington right now and the state legislature in Olympia, they are in session.
[01:27:06.212 --> 01:27:13.277]  And they are considering a half a dozen different bills to nullify
[01:27:14.471 --> 01:27:36.658]  The federal court decision, Kelo versus the New London, Connecticut city of New London, that was that eminent domain thing that the court gave them the right to take private property through eminent domain and then give it to a private organization.
[01:27:36.658 --> 01:27:40.720]  And so here we've got all these states across the country.
[01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:43.781]  The state legislatures are stepping up to the plate.
[01:27:44.665 --> 01:27:49.187]  And they're nullifying that federal court decision.
[01:27:49.187 --> 01:27:51.668]  And it's going to pass here in Washington.
[01:27:51.668 --> 01:27:53.068]  There's no question about it.
[01:27:53.068 --> 01:27:59.331]  The local paper had quite an editorial on yesterday's issue.
[01:27:59.331 --> 01:28:04.653]  And the local newspaper is promoting this.
[01:28:04.653 --> 01:28:08.815]  They are pushing to get this legislation passed.
[01:28:10.052 --> 01:28:14.837]  In our state legislature, and it's happening all over the nation.
[01:28:14.837 --> 01:28:22.606]  Congressman Ron Paul, he has identified what's going on in these state legislatures.
[01:28:22.606 --> 01:28:25.690]  He's named it, he's defined it as nullification.
[01:28:31.136 --> 01:28:39.540]  State legislatures, like in Montana, my home state, their gun control thing last year, their gun bill.
[01:28:39.540 --> 01:28:51.525]  Sam, we manufacture our own firearms, and so the bottom line is, as long as people realize this is the long fight, and don't expect instant gratification for liberty, and just slowly, continually
[01:28:52.105 --> 01:28:55.188]  Press against the enemy, against their machinery.
[01:28:55.188 --> 01:28:58.711]  We have right, we have history, we have the people on our side.
[01:28:58.711 --> 01:28:59.311]  We will win.
[01:28:59.311 --> 01:29:03.775]  But, Reb, when we come back, I'm concerned about false flag stage terror.
[01:29:04.798 --> 01:29:21.425]  That's the only ace in the hole the enemy has to bring in tyranny and control are trying to start a violent revolution beforehand that they provocateur kind of like a oil well fire specialist will use an explosion to put out a fire.
[01:29:22.429 --> 01:29:47.152]  I want to pick your brain, Red, on how you think the Empire is going to strike back, because they are in full retreat on the swine flu hoax, on the banker bailout takeover, on new wars, on the healthcare takeover, on the carbon taxes, but they're still reforming and coming back at us, so we need to realize the enemy counter-strike is already in full swing.
[01:29:47.152 --> 01:29:48.073]  Red Beckman, stay there.
[01:29:51.474 --> 01:29:55.397]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.397 --> 01:30:00.420]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.420 --> 01:30:07.425]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:30:07.425 --> 01:30:09.506]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[01:30:09.506 --> 01:30:11.747]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.

[01:31:00.160 --> 01:31:04.704]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:31:04.704 --> 01:31:09.048]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:31:09.048 --> 01:31:14.794]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:31:14.794 --> 01:31:20.099]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:31:20.399 --> 01:31:21.220]  Number 3.
[01:31:21.220 --> 01:31:24.823]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:31:24.823 --> 01:31:28.726]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:31:28.726 --> 01:31:29.526]  Number 4.
[01:31:29.526 --> 01:31:32.288]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:31:32.288 --> 01:31:35.971]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:31:35.971 --> 01:31:36.772]  Number 5.
[01:31:36.772 --> 01:31:40.915]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:31:40.915 --> 01:31:45.679]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:32:00.560 --> 01:32:03.563]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:32:03.563 --> 01:32:08.908]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:32:08.908 --> 01:32:10.950]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:32:10.950 --> 01:32:15.955]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:32:15.955 --> 01:32:16.876]  How much do you want?
[01:32:17.116 --> 01:32:18.237]  When do you want it?
[01:32:18.237 --> 01:32:20.138]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:32:20.138 --> 01:32:21.198]  When will you need it?
[01:32:21.198 --> 01:32:23.399]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:32:23.399 --> 01:32:24.740]  Will there be any food?
[01:32:24.740 --> 01:32:26.281]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:32:26.281 --> 01:32:31.544]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:32:31.544 --> 01:32:35.126]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:32:35.126 --> 01:32:38.588]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:32:38.948 --> 01:32:40.169]  How much will you need?
[01:32:40.169 --> 01:32:41.070]  We don't know.
[01:32:41.070 --> 01:32:42.170]  How much do you want?
[01:32:42.170 --> 01:32:43.111]  All you can get.
[01:32:43.111 --> 01:32:44.192]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:32:44.192 --> 01:32:47.254]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:32:47.254 --> 01:32:49.435]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:32:49.435 --> 01:32:50.456]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:33:05.325 --> 01:33:06.866]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:06.866 --> 01:33:09.787]  For the last 30 minutes, Red Beckman has been on with us.
[01:33:09.787 --> 01:33:11.488]  He'll be with us halfway into the next hour.
[01:33:11.488 --> 01:33:17.351]  We just started simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.tv and Living Video Color.
[01:33:17.351 --> 01:33:20.993]  If you're a PrisonPlanet.tv member, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:33:20.993 --> 01:33:25.196]  By the way, we're going to be adding a lot of new features in the next few weeks.
[01:33:25.196 --> 01:33:27.237]  I'm just going to leave it at that, at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:33:30.258 --> 01:33:33.659]  So certainly, I look forward to that for all the great members over there.
[01:33:33.659 --> 01:33:40.641]  And of course, everybody can listen for free on your local AM and FM, shortwave, satellite, or the free podcast at InfoWars.com.

[01:33:57.947 --> 01:33:59.548]  Infowars.com.
[01:33:59.548 --> 01:34:03.430]  And don't forget, we fund our operation through you, the listener.
[01:34:03.430 --> 01:34:04.270]  You support us.
[01:34:04.270 --> 01:34:14.596]  When you buy a book, a t-shirt, that funds this 8,000 square foot office, the documentaries, the books, the live radio show, my crew.
[01:34:14.596 --> 01:34:18.618]  We are in the midst of finishing up our big TV studio next door.
[01:34:19.959 --> 01:34:22.801]  And launching a whole bunch of new operations.
[01:34:22.801 --> 01:34:24.422]  I'm not risking my life.
[01:34:24.422 --> 01:34:34.170]  I'm not fighting 14, 15, some days 18 hours a day, some days 24 hours a day, against the globalists because I think I'm going to lose.
[01:34:34.170 --> 01:34:36.472]  These people are dangerous killers.
[01:34:36.472 --> 01:34:37.833]  They run the planet.
[01:34:37.833 --> 01:34:39.234]  They do whatever they want.
[01:34:39.234 --> 01:34:42.156]  But history shows tyrants always reach too far.
[01:34:42.156 --> 01:34:46.420]  I wouldn't be fighting them and risking my life if I didn't know they
[01:34:47.506 --> 01:34:48.786]  Could be beaten.
[01:34:48.786 --> 01:34:50.347]  I know they can be beaten.
[01:34:50.347 --> 01:34:52.208]  I know they will be beaten.
[01:34:52.208 --> 01:34:56.689]  And if you listen to my show ten years ago, it was a lot more negative than it is now.
[01:34:56.689 --> 01:35:08.954]  I said if we don't wake people up, if we don't educate people about the true architecture of world government, if we don't educate them as the controlled banking collapse comes, we have the IMF and World Bank documents, we know what they've done in every other country,
[01:35:09.534 --> 01:35:13.578]  We know what they've done in England in 1815 with the Rothschilds.
[01:35:13.578 --> 01:35:21.665]  If we don't do this, and if we don't educate the military and police that they're expendable and being used and brainwashed, then these people are going to win.
[01:35:21.665 --> 01:35:32.033]  But I started waging war 16 years ago against the tyranny, 14 years ago on air, Red Beckman back in the early 1950s, and it takes time.
[01:35:32.033 --> 01:35:33.495]  And that's the number one message.
[01:35:33.495 --> 01:35:36.577]  Now going back to Red Beckman and then your phone calls and a lot of other issues,
[01:35:37.498 --> 01:35:41.061]  Red, I was asking you the question of the enemy's counter-operations.
[01:35:41.061 --> 01:35:46.104]  I mean, I am shocked by how out in the open they are now.
[01:35:46.104 --> 01:35:54.850]  I guess that's hubris or false arrogance or a face they're putting on because their internal documents from Cass Sunstein, the Congress, the UN,
[01:35:55.390 --> 01:35:58.991]  Stuff they don't widely publicize, but that is publicly available.
[01:35:58.991 --> 01:36:00.591]  They say they're in deep danger.
[01:36:00.591 --> 01:36:07.433]  They are freaking out, saying we've got to go with shutting down web, arresting people that criticize government.
[01:36:07.433 --> 01:36:11.714]  We've got to go to a hot tyranny, not a cold incremental tyranny.
[01:36:11.714 --> 01:36:14.875]  Which is good, because the cold incremental tyranny is hard to beat.
[01:36:15.715 --> 01:36:21.838]  Because it sneaks around, like Cicero said, inside your gates.
[01:36:21.838 --> 01:36:25.320]  I like it that they're coming right out in the open.
[01:36:25.320 --> 01:36:28.281]  And so why do you think they're openly announcing world government?
[01:36:28.281 --> 01:36:34.864]  Why do you think they're openly shifting from denying all this to admitting it, but putting their spin on it?
[01:36:34.864 --> 01:36:38.186]  And how do you see them counter-striking?
[01:36:38.186 --> 01:36:41.387]  Well, you know, I think that so much of this is
[01:36:43.586 --> 01:36:45.408]  Uh, the Spin Masters, of course.
[01:36:45.408 --> 01:36:48.631]  Uh, they're just paid.
[01:36:48.631 --> 01:36:52.234]  These are people that are paid to come up with all this stuff.
[01:36:52.234 --> 01:36:56.898]  I think that they're in a state of terror.
[01:36:56.898 --> 01:36:58.800]  Uh, they're looking for a place to hide.
[01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:05.766]  Uh, they're, uh, you know, everything is going backwards for them.
[01:37:05.766 --> 01:37:07.867]  They're not getting the job done.
[01:37:07.867 --> 01:37:09.168]  They're not getting the guns.
[01:37:09.168 --> 01:37:10.650]  They're not going to get the guns.
[01:37:12.706 --> 01:37:19.450]  I mean, they might get what comes out the end of the barrel of the gun, but they're not going to get the gun itself.
[01:37:19.450 --> 01:37:36.680]  And I think that, you know, 9-1-1, they were able to, you know, fool the American people initially into thinking it was those foreigners, those aliens.
[01:37:37.273 --> 01:37:43.555]  That had pulled us off of taking control of those planes and flying into the World Trade Center.
[01:37:43.555 --> 01:37:48.537]  How many Americans today are there that still believe that?
[01:37:48.537 --> 01:37:51.017]  Very, very, very few.
[01:37:51.017 --> 01:38:01.180]  And what we have is we've got hundreds of people all over this nation that are trying to put the pieces together.
[01:38:01.180 --> 01:38:02.661]  They're collecting the evidence.
[01:38:03.597 --> 01:38:11.262]  And I would dare say that there's some people out there that pull that off.
[01:38:11.262 --> 01:38:14.425]  They're right here in this country.
[01:38:14.425 --> 01:38:15.746]  They've got an escape hatch.
[01:38:15.746 --> 01:38:21.349]  They'll fly to some other country or something when it gets too hot, but they're still here.
[01:38:21.349 --> 01:38:29.455]  But I would dare say they kind of rub their necks once in a while, and I wonder if they kind of feel that rope settling around their neck.
[01:38:30.188 --> 01:38:54.046]  Because if they take another, do another dirty trick like they did 9-1-1, I'll tell you there's going to be some people that are going to get rounded up and they're going to be prosecuted for treason and the whole works and they're going to end up hanging from a gallow someplace because the American people
[01:38:54.961 --> 01:38:55.361]  I don't
[01:39:12.930 --> 01:39:14.830]  They're doing some thinking on their own.
[01:39:14.830 --> 01:39:19.731]  They're not depending on Obama to give them a sense of direction.
[01:39:19.731 --> 01:39:26.372]  I think they are getting along with the Iraqi people like they have never done.
[01:39:26.372 --> 01:39:35.334]  They're getting along with the Afghans, if you're reading between the lines and even not always between the lines.
[01:39:35.334 --> 01:39:40.215]  We're getting a different picture coming from both Afghanistan and Iraq.
[01:39:40.854 --> 01:39:54.539]  Because I think our military, I think they, we've got some people in there that have enough smarts to recognize that we cannot finance all these wars out there such as we've been doing.
[01:39:54.539 --> 01:40:07.803]  Well the attempt is to bankrupt the nation, it's to bankrupt the states, to the bankers who made all this money out of fiat thin air and want to bankrupt us just like a local bank wants to bankrupt the farmer, they want the land.
[01:40:07.803 --> 01:40:08.003]  Sure.
[01:40:09.506 --> 01:40:16.211]  And, uh, but, uh, I'll tell ya, um, uh, it's coming to an end, and coming very, very rapidly.
[01:40:16.211 --> 01:40:22.456]  Uh, much faster than I would've ever, uh, thought that it could happen.
[01:40:22.456 --> 01:40:37.647]  Uh, because I see it happening, uh, well, the last time I was on your show, several months ago, I, you know, uh, you, you put my address on there, and we said, anybody that sends a five dollar bill, we'll send them a copy of that little book, Walls on Our Minds.
[01:40:38.638 --> 01:40:40.943]  We sent out hundreds of them.
[01:40:40.943 --> 01:40:45.232]  We had never... I've done hundreds of talk shows, and I have never...
[01:40:46.335 --> 01:40:51.458]  Never had the response that we had from that show.
[01:40:51.458 --> 01:40:56.742]  We were on, I was on for at least an hour I think, but we got a tremendous response.
[01:40:56.742 --> 01:41:07.048]  Which is another indicator of how large the radio show's gotten, but how active the people are and how hungry they are for information.
[01:41:07.048 --> 01:41:11.011]  I read so much other stuff is going on and
[01:41:13.192 --> 01:41:13.693]  That's right.
[01:41:30.387 --> 01:41:34.949]  I even had the head of the American Legion on speaking out against it.
[01:41:34.949 --> 01:41:37.471]  But then they spin it and say the troops are angry.
[01:41:37.471 --> 01:41:40.412]  They say Obama isn't waging enough wars.
[01:41:40.412 --> 01:41:46.215]  They say Obama isn't giving them the surge they need, which is total false reality.
[01:41:46.215 --> 01:41:47.816]  The troops know we're going bankrupt.
[01:41:47.816 --> 01:41:48.876]  They know it's a fraud.
[01:41:48.876 --> 01:41:50.197]  They know it's a lie.
[01:41:50.197 --> 01:41:51.677]  They don't want to be there.
[01:41:51.677 --> 01:41:58.141]  But the media creates this fake spin that Obama's a liberal against the war when he's actually expanding it.
[01:41:59.281 --> 01:42:10.764]  It's just a, what do you call an entire envelopment of lies, where just everything is a lie, wrapped in a lie, stacked in a lie, packaged in another lie.
[01:42:10.764 --> 01:42:12.424]  It just isn't working anymore.
[01:42:12.424 --> 01:42:14.965]  Everything they do, the people see right through it.
[01:42:14.965 --> 01:42:16.845]  Take the hoax of Obama.
[01:42:16.845 --> 01:42:19.706]  People have woken up to him faster than any other puppet.
[01:42:19.706 --> 01:42:28.068]  Yeah, well, you know, 9-1-1, how many people are investigating?
[01:42:29.180 --> 01:42:38.308]  All the little things that happened with 9-1-1, and they're getting a picture of what happened.
[01:42:38.308 --> 01:42:43.392]  And it has to be making some people very, very nervous.
[01:42:43.392 --> 01:42:47.315]  And, of course, the same goes for Oklahoma City.
[01:42:47.315 --> 01:42:49.817]  We know that was an inside job.
[01:42:49.817 --> 01:42:54.841]  And there's people, after all these years, people are still putting the pieces together.
[01:42:58.163 --> 01:43:22.131]  I think that there is a possibility of another false flag operation, but I gotta assure you of one thing, that if there's a false flag operation, they're not going to be able to call it anything else, right from the beginning, because the American people now have their eyes wide open.
[01:43:22.131 --> 01:43:26.953]  That's right, we've taken... And you know, I used to say that
[01:43:28.209 --> 01:43:33.175]  People just didn't listen to what we were saying back there 20, 30 years ago.
[01:43:33.175 --> 01:43:42.486]  But I said, when we have an economic holocaust hit us in this country, their hearing will get better.
[01:43:42.486 --> 01:43:43.968]  And that's what's happened.
[01:43:43.968 --> 01:43:45.170]  People are listening.
[01:43:45.973 --> 01:43:48.037]  To what Alex Jones is saying.
[01:43:48.037 --> 01:43:54.347]  They're listening to what Red Beckman has said and they're reading the books.
[01:43:54.347 --> 01:43:58.454]  Of course, you know me.
[01:43:58.454 --> 01:43:59.797]  I've always been an optimist.
[01:44:00.896 --> 01:44:13.660]  I've always said we're going to pull this thing out, and I'm still convinced of it, and more convinced than I've ever been in all these years because of what I have seen.
[01:44:13.660 --> 01:44:25.944]  You know, you get Tea Party people by the millions out there, and this is something we need to do, and that is encourage all these Tea Party organizations across the country.
[01:44:26.727 --> 01:44:39.791]  Now, I was on a talk show here a couple weeks ago and the fellow said, he was from Colorado, he said there's 16, uh, separate Tea Party groups in the state of Colorado that he knew of.
[01:44:39.791 --> 01:44:55.775]  Now, we want to encourage all these, uh, small groups around the country, whether they're, uh, Sheriff Mac, uh, people, whether they're, uh, Tea Party people or Oath Keepers, um, they need to keep their
[01:44:56.454 --> 01:44:59.398]  They're a local organization.
[01:44:59.398 --> 01:45:00.519]  Autonomous.
[01:45:00.519 --> 01:45:01.240]  Yes!
[01:45:01.240 --> 01:45:08.249]  Don't, don't do like, uh, and come up with something, a top-heavy organization like the NRA.
[01:45:09.383 --> 01:45:13.627]  The NRA, the National Rifle Association, we don't know what they're going to do about Hansen.
[01:45:13.627 --> 01:45:15.429]  Well, Red, let me jump in here for a minute.
[01:45:15.429 --> 01:45:16.270]  Exactly.
[01:45:16.270 --> 01:45:24.758]  They've sent in Glenn Beck, who is as phony as a $3 bill, and Sarah Palin, McCain's minion, that's all you need to know, to take it over.
[01:45:24.758 --> 01:45:31.705]  But the good news is, we're actually going into the larger organization they're trying to create and using that to educate
[01:45:32.245 --> 01:45:39.251]  Good Americans who are seeking after the truth and they're pulling their hair out because they're trying to co-opt us.
[01:45:39.251 --> 01:45:44.355]  Instead, we're co-opting their attempted co-opt and they're panicking.
[01:45:44.355 --> 01:45:46.917]  So I want you to comment on that, but then going back to false flag.
[01:45:47.637 --> 01:45:54.443]  Look at how Kurt Haskell, his wife, and all these other witnesses on the plane, it turns out, are 9-11 truthers.
[01:45:54.443 --> 01:46:01.049]  And so they recognize the other bomber, the government helping get him on the plane in Amsterdam.
[01:46:01.049 --> 01:46:03.952]  They stood their ground against the FBI.
[01:46:03.952 --> 01:46:09.377]  And two weeks after, three weeks after, the FBI had to come out and say, okay, we ordered the State Department to let him on the plane.
[01:46:09.377 --> 01:46:11.178]  We were watching him and protecting him, just like 9-11.
[01:46:12.399 --> 01:46:18.701]  And, you know, we let it happen, and Ridge comes out and admits they would issue fake terror alerts in his new book.
[01:46:18.701 --> 01:46:30.625]  I mean, we've gone to the point of now where people didn't know the term false flag, or inside job, or self-inflicted wound, or Reichstag event, or staged terror attack, or Hegelian dialectic.
[01:46:30.625 --> 01:46:35.246]  And now the general public does understand that, and we've got polls of over 90% in Gallup.
[01:46:35.246 --> 01:46:36.006]  It was 75 six months ago.
[01:46:38.627 --> 01:46:40.548]  Wanting to abolish or audit the Fed.
[01:46:40.548 --> 01:46:44.111]  I mean, folks, when I tell you, now again, they're coming down on us.
[01:46:44.111 --> 01:46:45.252]  We're in the war.
[01:46:45.252 --> 01:46:46.152]  They're attacking us.
[01:46:46.152 --> 01:46:47.413]  We're in deep trouble.
[01:46:47.413 --> 01:46:51.676]  They're passing laws everywhere to tax food now, which only tyrants do.
[01:46:51.676 --> 01:46:56.260]  I mean, we're in bad shape, but at least we know we're being attacked.
[01:46:56.260 --> 01:46:57.901]  At least we're not in a coma.
[01:46:57.901 --> 01:47:00.122]  At least we're finding our legs.
[01:47:00.122 --> 01:47:03.765]  And anybody who's been in a fight knows, once you start swinging, you're not worried about it.
[01:47:04.165 --> 01:47:15.455]  And America is starting to swing, and the world is starting to swing, and they're discovering the enemy is not the puppet politicians, it's the stinking central bankers.
[01:47:15.455 --> 01:47:16.676]  It's the New World Order.
[01:47:16.676 --> 01:47:23.102]  So, Red, going back to the underwear bomber, and then also the attempted co-opting of the Tea Parties.
[01:47:23.102 --> 01:47:29.868]  Well, you know, the underwear... Excuse me.
[01:47:29.868 --> 01:47:30.389]  Get some water.
[01:47:31.628 --> 01:47:36.309]  Uh, the, um, the, uh, underwear, uh, bomber.
[01:47:36.309 --> 01:47:42.611]  Uh, this proves what I'm saying, that, uh, people are now very much alert.
[01:47:42.611 --> 01:47:47.573]  When something like this happens, they are immediately right in there getting the clues.
[01:47:47.573 --> 01:47:50.874]  And, and, it didn't take them long to unravel it, did it?
[01:47:50.874 --> 01:47:51.634]  No.
[01:47:51.634 --> 01:47:54.495]  I mean, they unraveled it, and, uh, it's, um,
[01:47:55.285 --> 01:48:08.510]  It's an embarrassment to the establishment to find out that us people out here, we can unravel their schemes.
[01:48:08.510 --> 01:48:09.971]  They're conspiracies.
[01:48:09.971 --> 01:48:10.731]  That's what it is.
[01:48:10.731 --> 01:48:14.032]  They call us conspirators.
[01:48:14.032 --> 01:48:15.313]  They are the conspirators.
[01:48:15.313 --> 01:48:17.213]  We now have their handbook.
[01:48:17.213 --> 01:48:17.774]  Absolutely.
[01:48:22.718 --> 01:48:26.702]  It's a new ball game from what it was five years ago.
[01:48:26.702 --> 01:48:28.243]  It's a game changer.
[01:48:28.243 --> 01:48:29.364]  Absolutely.
[01:48:29.364 --> 01:48:32.927]  It's just absolutely amazing.
[01:48:32.927 --> 01:48:33.728]  And a thrill.
[01:48:33.728 --> 01:48:35.149]  A real thrill for me.
[01:48:35.149 --> 01:48:39.112]  But just because we've got the ball doesn't mean we've won the game.
[01:48:39.112 --> 01:48:40.754]  That's true, but we're going to win it.
[01:48:40.754 --> 01:48:45.958]  And by now, if they don't know, we're going to win it.
[01:48:45.958 --> 01:48:47.740]  They're not near as smart as they thought they were.
[01:48:49.727 --> 01:48:51.668]  Well, Red, I've never heard you this positive.
[01:48:51.668 --> 01:48:53.029]  You're really excited.
[01:48:53.029 --> 01:49:00.532]  Well, I just, you know, I'm on the phone a great deal, talking to people all over this country.
[01:49:00.532 --> 01:49:06.355]  And I just get such a fantastic response.
[01:49:06.355 --> 01:49:12.378]  My books are, you know, I wrote Born Again Republic in 1980, the fall of 1980.
[01:49:12.378 --> 01:49:13.459]  That book is still in print.
[01:49:18.561 --> 01:49:21.443]  And of course, my last book, Why the Militia.
[01:49:21.443 --> 01:49:30.106]  Boy, I'll tell you, people read that and they say, there is a primer that every patriot needs to read.
[01:49:30.106 --> 01:49:33.808]  And of course, walls in our minds, it'll go on forever.
[01:49:33.808 --> 01:49:35.429]  And I joke about it.
[01:49:35.429 --> 01:49:42.032]  I say, I'm 81, and I'm not going to last forever, but I'm going to kick butt after I'm gone.
[01:49:43.567 --> 01:49:45.108]  That's the great part about it, isn't it?
[01:49:45.108 --> 01:49:49.392]  Once you've told the truth, once you've told the truth, it always stands.
[01:49:49.392 --> 01:49:51.673]  Yeah.
[01:49:51.673 --> 01:49:55.216]  Yeah, well, I'll tell you.
[01:49:55.216 --> 01:50:01.121]  It's, you know, it is such an exciting thing.
[01:50:01.121 --> 01:50:07.266]  When you talk to people that in the past they wouldn't listen to you, they wouldn't pay attention to you.
[01:50:07.266 --> 01:50:08.907]  Now they're coming and saying, hey,
[01:50:10.396 --> 01:50:14.559]  You told us that this was going to happen and we didn't believe you, but it's here!
[01:50:40.596 --> 01:50:41.297]  It's amazing.
[01:50:41.297 --> 01:50:45.120]  The final illusion to fall is that we're the minority.
[01:50:45.120 --> 01:50:48.743]  No, we are the majority.
[01:50:48.743 --> 01:50:51.605]  I mean, I've even got yuppie neighbors that were laughing at me two years ago.
[01:50:51.605 --> 01:50:52.506]  They're not laughing now.
[01:50:52.506 --> 01:50:54.407]  They're saying, what do I do?
[01:50:54.407 --> 01:50:58.690]  Because the world government's been openly announced.
[01:50:58.690 --> 01:50:59.251]  We'll be right back.
[01:51:01.144 --> 01:51:02.445]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.445 --> 01:51:08.047]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:08.047 --> 01:51:13.049]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:13.049 --> 01:51:18.631]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:51:18.631 --> 01:51:23.313]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:23.854 --> 01:51:30.956]  They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:30.956 --> 01:51:32.077]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:32.077 --> 01:51:34.858]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:51:34.858 --> 01:51:38.759]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:38.759 --> 01:51:41.960]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:41.960 --> 01:51:44.961]  That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:51:44.961 --> 01:51:45.221]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:51:45.221 --> 01:51:45.461]  Remember,
[01:51:53.865 --> 01:51:54.385]  We're good to go.
[01:52:13.302 --> 01:52:16.285]  People like you have to say about the wild food experience.
[01:52:16.285 --> 01:52:20.969]  As a homesteader attempting to live sustainably, I was floored by the amount of information in this book.
[01:52:20.969 --> 01:52:25.193]  Dear Linda, I would be hard-pressed to express how much you have impacted my life.
[01:52:25.193 --> 01:52:29.558]  I'm amazed by the wealth of the author's knowledge and the depth of the coverage in this book.
[01:52:29.558 --> 01:52:34.122]  As we see more and more GMO foods on the shelves, this information is good to know.
[01:52:34.122 --> 01:52:35.984]  I am thankful to God for you, Linda.
[01:52:36.184 --> 01:52:38.325]  I can't say enough about this book.
[01:52:38.325 --> 01:52:40.245]  Blessings to you and your family.
[01:52:40.245 --> 01:52:45.947]  The greatest effect this book has had on me and my family is that we truly see Urse Bouncy everywhere.
[01:52:45.947 --> 01:52:49.369]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.

[01:53:00.973 --> 01:53:04.214]  Have your house payments skyrocketed under an adjustable rate mortgage?
[01:53:04.873 --> 01:53:06.213]  Have you been laid off?
[01:53:06.213 --> 01:53:07.954]  Or had your hours cut?
[01:53:07.954 --> 01:53:10.194]  Are balloon payments coming due?
[01:53:10.194 --> 01:53:14.015]  You need help from MortgageFraudExaminers.com.
[01:53:14.015 --> 01:53:20.456]  To stop the housing crisis, Congress and the White House are pinning their hopes on homeowners renegotiating their mortgages.
[01:53:20.456 --> 01:53:24.617]  The trouble is, the banks are saying no 80% of the time.
[01:53:24.617 --> 01:53:27.738]  MortgageFraudExaminers.com can help you get the leverage you need.
[01:53:32.096 --> 01:53:32.336]  I think so.
[01:54:06.559 --> 01:54:08.100]  Red Beckman is our guest.
[01:54:08.100 --> 01:54:10.442]  He founded the Fully Informed Jury Association.
[01:54:10.442 --> 01:54:18.769]  Red, I want to come back in the start of the next hour and start taking some phone calls and read some Twitter questions for you.
[01:54:18.769 --> 01:54:31.619]  But the first thing I wanted to get into now is encapsulate the three votes that Americans have, contrary to what they've been indoctrinated with, only having the ballot box.
[01:54:31.619 --> 01:54:35.082]  Yes, with our vote on Election Day,
[01:54:36.511 --> 01:54:45.598]  I, you know, we went to the polls and we ended up, we weren't voting for somebody we wanted, we voted against somebody.
[01:54:45.598 --> 01:54:48.461]  Almost invariably in my lifetime, that's what happened.
[01:54:50.473 --> 01:54:59.657]  And so our vote on election day was stolen because George Bush Sr., of course, he said, read my lips, no new taxes.
[01:54:59.657 --> 01:55:02.478]  And he got elected.
[01:55:02.478 --> 01:55:06.300]  And of course, he violated his campaign promise.
[01:55:06.300 --> 01:55:11.643]  Well, as far as I'm concerned, he stole every vote that people gave him to get him in there.
[01:55:13.565 --> 01:55:29.416]  And so, over the years, it has become so obvious, and of course, some say that as many as 65% of the American people don't even go to vote anymore because it's a waste of time, and it doesn't count.
[01:55:29.416 --> 01:55:38.463]  The Founders, they looked back in history, under Magna Carta and England, and they recognized that the grand jury
[01:55:39.255 --> 01:55:52.220]  Was a key factor in maintaining an honest and a government that was, you know, clean and had integrity and all of that.
[01:55:52.220 --> 01:56:07.507]  They recognized also that the power of the jury, a 12-person jury, if you have one person on that jury that know how much power they have and they protect their own power,
[01:56:08.191 --> 01:56:10.453]  They can hang that jury.
[01:56:10.453 --> 01:56:22.101]  And of course, in many, many cases, we've had many cases where one person on the jury knew about their power and they educate the other 11 when they're in deliberations.
[01:56:22.466 --> 01:56:42.992]  But the judges discriminate against people that know their rights and try to keep them off, so people have got to keep their mouths shut until they're seated, and this is a key underbelly of the enemy to go out and educate people about the power of the jury, the grand jury, and then of course there's the fourth way to vote, the cartridge box, but we don't want to do that.
[01:56:42.992 --> 01:56:47.474]  We want that cartridge box available.
[01:56:47.474 --> 01:56:49.814]  It needs to be available at all times.
[01:56:49.814 --> 01:56:52.095]  That détente, I like that word.
[01:56:53.327 --> 01:56:55.928]  Because it fits our situation.
[01:56:55.928 --> 01:57:05.551]  When we come back, I want to tell you a story about Eustace Mullins and something that happened back about 1984.
[01:57:05.551 --> 01:57:12.934]  And I think that people just do not realize how close we were.
[01:57:15.043 --> 01:57:18.925]  To being taken over by the New World Order.
[01:57:18.925 --> 01:57:24.966]  Well, I'm sure that the people and the hundreds of people that got that the last time I was on, they need another book because they've already given that book or lost track of it.
[01:57:24.966 --> 01:57:26.047]  It went someplace.
[01:57:41.729 --> 01:57:59.744]  This time, anybody that will send a $10 bill, money order is good of course, but we'll send them a copy of Walls on Our Minds and also a copy of the book Why the Militia.
[01:57:59.744 --> 01:58:01.045]  When they read my books,
[01:58:02.065 --> 01:58:03.967]  They don't want to read them just once.
[01:58:03.967 --> 01:58:14.038]  They want to read them several times, and of course, to order those two books, all they have to do is write to Red Beckman at P.O.
[01:58:14.038 --> 01:58:22.968]  Box 61, Carrolls, and that's C-A-R-R-O-L-L-S, Carrolls, Washington.
[01:58:23.795 --> 01:58:26.876]  9-8-6-0-9.
[01:58:26.876 --> 01:58:28.076]  That's the zip code.
[01:58:28.076 --> 01:58:30.237]  Alright, we've got a break.
[01:58:30.237 --> 01:58:34.378]  We'll give it out again before you leave.
[01:58:34.378 --> 01:58:37.039]  And I want to talk about why the militia?
[01:58:37.039 --> 01:58:39.139]  What is the real role of the militia?
[01:58:39.139 --> 01:58:43.201]  What is the militia?
[01:58:43.201 --> 01:58:45.701]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:59:56.121 --> 01:59:58.903]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.410 --> 02:00:10.254]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.254 --> 02:00:11.815]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.815 --> 02:00:13.396]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.396 --> 02:00:17.580]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.580 --> 02:00:21.623]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.163 --> 02:00:33.408]  He wrote the book, No Island That Never Was, traveled all over the country to the state houses proving that the 16th Amendment to give us the income tax was never properly ratified.
[02:00:33.408 --> 02:00:35.810]  He founded the Fully Informed Jury Association.
[02:00:35.810 --> 02:00:39.272]  It's in all 50 states and it's just an incredible work.
[02:00:39.272 --> 02:00:47.856]  And I may try to twist his arm to stay with us till the 50 after coming up because it's always great to have Red Beckman on and I do want to get to your calls as promised.
[02:00:47.856 --> 02:00:48.857]  But Eustace Mullins
[02:00:49.815 --> 02:00:57.058]  Well, it was about 1984 and I was a speaker and Eustace was a speaker and Congressman Ron Paul was a speaker.
[02:01:13.684 --> 02:01:20.688]  At an investors conference in the Caesars Palace, the big casino in Las Vegas.
[02:01:20.688 --> 02:01:30.553]  And the conference didn't start until Monday and a lot of people had checked in, including myself.
[02:01:30.553 --> 02:01:32.394]  We checked in on Sunday afternoon.
[02:01:33.328 --> 02:01:39.893]  And the people that organized this, they called me after I was checked in.
[02:01:39.893 --> 02:01:56.925]  They called and said, Red, we've got about 800 people that are already registered here and the management of the casino had said that the big ballroom was empty and if we wanted to put together an impromptu meeting,
[02:01:58.139 --> 02:02:04.844]  Uh, in there on Sunday evening, he said, uh, they can have it, free of charge.
[02:02:04.844 --> 02:02:22.536]  And so, uh, they said, uh, Red, if you will go over there and set that up and you can emcee and, uh, you can take 20 minutes and, uh, and of course, uh, Eustace Mullins was there and give him 20 minutes and give Ron Paul 20 minutes.
[02:02:22.536 --> 02:02:23.437]  And so we did.
[02:02:23.437 --> 02:02:26.679]  And we had a really, uh, a real good crowd there.
[02:02:27.635 --> 02:02:41.703]  And, uh, I took the 20 minutes and, uh, well, I think I had, uh, Congressman Ron Paul went first, I think, and then Eustace Mullins, and then, uh, I took it and, uh, I opened it up for questions.
[02:02:41.703 --> 02:02:47.706]  And Ron, er, uh, Eustace Mullins had talked about the New World Order.
[02:02:47.706 --> 02:02:51.468]  In 1984, there weren't many people talking about New World Order.
[02:02:51.468 --> 02:02:52.529]  They didn't know what it was.
[02:02:54.722 --> 02:03:06.966]  And so a lady asked from the audience, she asked Eustace Moller, she said, when do you think this is going to happen, that the New World Order will take over?
[02:03:06.966 --> 02:03:10.987]  And Eustace says, oh, it's already happened.
[02:03:10.987 --> 02:03:13.747]  This is about 1984.
[02:03:13.747 --> 02:03:19.749]  And if you will look back at our history that we have made since that time,
[02:03:21.115 --> 02:03:29.484]  You can see the footprint of the Rothschilds and the Federal Reserve Bank.
[02:03:29.484 --> 02:03:32.927]  You can see them in everything that has happened.
[02:03:32.927 --> 02:03:36.651]  America has been turned into a pure engine of the New World Order.
[02:03:36.651 --> 02:03:37.332]  Absolutely.
[02:03:40.373 --> 02:03:56.708]  Understood that, he had identified it, and he explained himself, explained what his thinking was very well, and I don't think there was anybody there that didn't recognize that what he was saying was 100% correct.
[02:03:56.708 --> 02:04:05.616]  Well I think it's important to recognize they took over as revolutionaries, we're restorationists kicking the hijackers out.
[02:04:06.641 --> 02:04:12.385]  Yeah, well, there's one thing that we need to stress, too, Alex.
[02:04:12.385 --> 02:04:23.554]  We have people in the Ron Paul revolution and the Tea Party people and all, and they're talking about we're into the second American revolution.
[02:04:23.554 --> 02:04:31.260]  The second American revolution started when the ink wasn't even dry, when the founders signed the Constitution.
[02:04:32.593 --> 02:04:33.893]  Explain that to people.
[02:04:33.893 --> 02:04:34.813]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:04:34.813 --> 02:04:37.274]  When we come back and we're going to calls, stay there.
[02:04:37.274 --> 02:04:39.354]  We've got a break again, Red Beckman.
[02:04:39.354 --> 02:04:44.355]  And we'll get out that address again to get the two books for $10 before you leave us.
[02:04:44.355 --> 02:04:52.097]  Obviously, our websites are Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv, JonesReport.com and Infowars.net.
[02:04:52.097 --> 02:04:58.818]  And be sure and check out the online video bookstore apparel department to get your Come and Take It Infowars.com shirt.
[02:05:00.762 --> 02:05:05.325]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:05:05.325 --> 02:05:06.225]  Number one.
[02:05:06.225 --> 02:05:09.648]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:05:09.648 --> 02:05:10.508]  Number two.
[02:05:10.508 --> 02:05:15.411]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:05:15.411 --> 02:05:16.152]  It's true.
[02:05:16.152 --> 02:05:21.015]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:05:21.015 --> 02:05:21.475]  Number three.
[02:05:21.835 --> 02:05:25.418]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:05:25.418 --> 02:05:30.142]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:05:30.142 --> 02:05:32.904]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:05:32.904 --> 02:05:37.368]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:05:37.368 --> 02:05:41.512]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:05:41.512 --> 02:05:46.276]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:05:46.556 --> 02:05:50.739]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:05:50.739 --> 02:05:52.521]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:05:52.521 --> 02:05:54.763]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:05:54.763 --> 02:05:57.124]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:06:02.455 --> 02:06:06.416]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:06:06.416 --> 02:06:15.277]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:06:15.277 --> 02:06:19.898]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:06:19.898 --> 02:06:30.720]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:06:31.360 --> 02:06:40.863]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:06:40.863 --> 02:06:46.305]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:06:46.305 --> 02:06:53.788]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:06:53.788 --> 02:06:56.529]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[02:07:01.698 --> 02:07:05.722]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:07:05.722 --> 02:07:08.966]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:07:08.966 --> 02:07:13.751]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:07:13.751 --> 02:07:20.158]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:07:20.158 --> 02:07:22.401]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:07:22.921 --> 02:07:23.221]  Tim Geithner?
[02:07:23.221 --> 02:07:23.741]  Bernanke?
[02:07:23.741 --> 02:07:24.341]  They're arsonists!
[02:07:24.341 --> 02:07:25.082]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:07:25.082 --> 02:07:27.202]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:07:41.826 --> 02:07:43.688]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:07:43.688 --> 02:07:49.112]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[02:07:49.112 --> 02:08:02.043]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:08:02.043 --> 02:08:07.628]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:17.450 --> 02:08:24.123]  Well, Red Beckman is just going to be with us for the rest of the hour, and I want to start getting to your phone calls with our guest.
[02:08:24.123 --> 02:08:25.546]  But, Red, you were trying to make a point.
[02:08:27.332 --> 02:08:30.995]  Well, if we're in a revolution, it's the third.
[02:08:58.050 --> 02:09:05.794]  A revolution which is going to restore our lawful government in this country.
[02:09:05.794 --> 02:09:24.283]  Because the Second American Revolution started right at the very beginning because we had some of those people back there in that generation who also thought that they were smart enough to where they could rule and the rest of us would be their servants.
[02:09:25.848 --> 02:09:33.355]  And so through subversion and it comes down, you can trace it all the way down through our history.
[02:09:33.355 --> 02:09:39.120]  The Civil War was an absolute atrocity that was perpetrated by some of these
[02:09:41.051 --> 02:09:44.332]  So-called very wise people, smart people.
[02:09:44.332 --> 02:09:52.655]  Well, it's on record that the Rothschilds and the British, I mean, it's mainline history, manipulated both sides to have the war.
[02:09:52.655 --> 02:09:54.995]  There wasn't a good side or a bad side.
[02:09:54.995 --> 02:09:57.976]  It was all manipulated to try to break the country up.
[02:09:57.976 --> 02:09:58.977]  Right.
[02:09:58.977 --> 02:10:06.959]  And you can see it then, and of course, as you come down through history, you can see that tremendous influx of
[02:10:08.022 --> 02:10:21.535]  Of European, uh, West European immigrants coming into this country, uh, starting about 1880 for sure, and, uh, continuing on until about 1910 or 1920.
[02:10:21.535 --> 02:10:25.659]  Uh, 30-some-odd million, they figure, came.
[02:10:25.659 --> 02:10:28.482]  And of course, uh, they didn't learn the language that quick.
[02:10:28.482 --> 02:10:30.964]  They learned it, and they became great Americans.
[02:10:32.421 --> 02:10:46.228]  But they were so easily manipulated, and of course, like I said earlier, we got the income tax and the 17th Amendment, of course, and we got the Federal Reserve Bank in 1913.
[02:10:47.642 --> 02:10:51.383]  That's right, most of the first Americans really wanted to get away from tyranny.
[02:10:51.383 --> 02:10:57.606]  Doesn't mean they were angels or perfect, but they were pretty street smart, wise, and sly.
[02:10:57.606 --> 02:11:04.208]  But you get a bunch of people, say, from Germany, hard-working, great people, they were property of their local lord.
[02:11:04.208 --> 02:11:06.629]  You had the Hessians who were military slaves.
[02:11:06.629 --> 02:11:13.071]  You know, they don't teach that in school because supposedly only blacks were indentured servants or slaves, complete fraud.
[02:11:13.071 --> 02:11:14.192]  You had other people from Poland.
[02:11:14.972 --> 02:11:21.335]  People from France, where they were under Napoleonic law of the government is God.
[02:11:21.335 --> 02:11:24.396]  And so they got here and didn't understand.
[02:11:24.396 --> 02:11:31.059]  And now we've got people from Mexico and Asia and other places with no history of freedom.
[02:11:31.059 --> 02:11:39.302]  And, Red, have you noticed the government's hiring all these illegals to be the military and the police and to be the CPS workers?
[02:11:39.302 --> 02:11:40.123]  Absolutely.
[02:11:40.123 --> 02:11:42.744]  And it's all according to their plan.
[02:11:43.997 --> 02:11:46.638]  And here's the thing that I have said.
[02:11:46.638 --> 02:11:51.980]  I've had so many people call me over the years and just so concerned.
[02:11:51.980 --> 02:11:56.703]  They say, oh, they're going to bring in the foreign troops.
[02:11:56.703 --> 02:11:58.583]  And there might be a certain amount of that.
[02:11:58.583 --> 02:12:06.167]  But you see, that's where we reach these people, these foreign troops, when they come in.
[02:12:06.167 --> 02:12:11.549]  And they are going to be absolutely amazed at what we have in this country.
[02:12:12.256 --> 02:12:18.117]  No, instead, they're incrementally... Well, instead, and hold on a second, I want to add this.
[02:12:18.117 --> 02:12:23.779]  They're incrementally having drills with foreign troops, having foreign troops help run the command and control.
[02:12:23.779 --> 02:12:27.419]  But no, they're recruiting the boy scouts to be the paramilitary.
[02:12:27.419 --> 02:12:29.340]  They're militarizing the police.
[02:12:29.340 --> 02:12:33.121]  They're bringing in the immigrants and making them our police and our military.
[02:12:33.121 --> 02:12:35.101]  They don't need to bring in a foreign force.
[02:12:35.101 --> 02:12:37.962]  They're turning the force into a foreign force.
[02:12:37.962 --> 02:12:39.062]  Yeah, well, the thing is,
[02:12:39.818 --> 02:12:47.363]  We have to inform those people, and they'll come over and they'll be on our side.
[02:12:47.363 --> 02:12:49.244]  In fact, that happened in the Revolutionary War.
[02:12:49.244 --> 02:12:54.387]  I know you know this, but tell folks about the Germans defecting en masse to our side.
[02:12:54.387 --> 02:12:56.648]  Oh, there was a tremendous number of them.
[02:12:56.648 --> 02:13:00.470]  They were the English, of course.
[02:13:00.470 --> 02:13:04.613]  They hired the Hessians.
[02:13:04.613 --> 02:13:06.154]  They were German troops.
[02:13:07.092 --> 02:13:16.820]  And of course, they're the ones that were the victims of George Washington and the famous crossing of the Delaware River.
[02:13:16.820 --> 02:13:18.321]  I think it was the Delaware, if I remember right.
[02:13:18.321 --> 02:13:21.504]  It was Trenton, yes, it was Trenton.
[02:13:21.504 --> 02:13:31.632]  And of course, I just think that it doesn't take a brain surgeon to figure out how corrupt our government is.
[02:13:33.292 --> 02:13:44.602]  And as long as we're able to speak, and as long as we have our written materials out there and such, the whole world is watching us now.
[02:13:44.602 --> 02:13:46.984]  They're watching us very close.
[02:13:46.984 --> 02:13:57.454]  And I think that we've got more people out there in the other countries of the world that are cheering us on.
[02:13:58.544 --> 02:14:01.365]  They're all for us.
[02:14:01.365 --> 02:14:08.307]  They recognize that we have something here that they would all like to have.
[02:14:08.307 --> 02:14:13.269]  They don't like the central banks.
[02:14:13.269 --> 02:14:15.990]  The central banks are in trouble all over this world today.
[02:14:17.401 --> 02:14:21.388]  And so, you know, the Euro isn't doing all that great.
[02:14:21.388 --> 02:14:26.456]  The dollar, the only thing that's holding up the dollar at this point is the fact that the Euro's having a problem.
[02:14:26.456 --> 02:14:28.720]  Well, Red, think how far we've come.
[02:14:29.986 --> 02:14:37.208]  Where, 20 years ago, the media said Rothschilds don't exist, Trilateral Commission doesn't exist.
[02:14:37.208 --> 02:14:38.288]  We're not joking.
[02:14:38.288 --> 02:14:46.471]  Bilderberg Group doesn't exist, the Federal Reserve isn't private, and now they go, okay, it's all real, what's the big deal?
[02:14:46.471 --> 02:14:53.933]  I want to go to phone calls, but coming up, I want to get into your book, Why the Militia, with an encapsulation of what the militia really is.
[02:14:53.933 --> 02:14:57.674]  How do you stop infiltration, provocateur, false flag setups.
[02:14:58.214 --> 02:14:58.634]  Oh, anytime.
[02:15:18.231 --> 02:15:24.236]  Okay, we're gonna go to Brian, Nick, Trevor, Mark, Karen, Kenneth, and others.
[02:15:24.236 --> 02:15:26.178]  James, well James just hung up.
[02:15:26.178 --> 02:15:30.882]  Brian in Canada, you're on the air with Red Beckman, go ahead.
[02:15:30.882 --> 02:15:34.786]  Yeah, hi, I'm not in Canada, I'm actually in China.
[02:15:34.786 --> 02:15:36.407]  Okay, go ahead sir.
[02:15:36.407 --> 02:15:41.231]  Well that's close enough, I mean, I misread it.
[02:15:41.231 --> 02:15:44.094]  The next caller's from Canada, but you're calling from China, go ahead.
[02:15:45.726 --> 02:15:49.727]  I just want to say that all of your sites have been banned here in China.
[02:15:49.727 --> 02:15:53.909]  I can't access any of them.
[02:15:53.909 --> 02:16:00.511]  And the only way I can access it is with a special program that, you know, deals with the proxy.
[02:16:00.511 --> 02:16:01.351]  I don't know if you know that.
[02:16:01.351 --> 02:16:03.452]  I don't know if you knew that at all.
[02:16:03.452 --> 02:16:07.353]  Yeah, I know InfoWars and Prison Planet off and on get banned.
[02:16:07.353 --> 02:16:13.035]  Do you know about InfoWars.net, JonesReport.com, ObamaDeception.net?
[02:16:13.035 --> 02:16:13.895]  Are those all banned too?
[02:16:15.800 --> 02:16:19.063]  I haven't checked them out, but I checked Prison Planet and Infowars.
[02:16:19.063 --> 02:16:20.744]  They're definitely banned.
[02:16:20.744 --> 02:16:27.009]  Well, that's why... Why don't you take a screenshot of how it's banned and email it, if you can even get it out of the country.
[02:16:27.009 --> 02:16:36.636]  What do you think of the announcements of the Italian, the Australian, the British, and the UN that they want worldwide Chinese-style censorship?
[02:16:36.636 --> 02:16:40.620]  Well, I'm actually an Australian myself, and I heard that, you know, Clinton is
[02:16:41.658 --> 02:16:47.365]  You know, asking for free internet, but at the same time, they're censoring it.
[02:16:47.365 --> 02:16:54.094]  I mean, you know, in England, you know, everything is logged and kept for over a year or something like that.
[02:16:54.094 --> 02:17:00.261]  Also, the so-called free government broadband for the public, that the public pays for, it's not free.
[02:17:01.656 --> 02:17:03.318]  Well, it wasn't that long ago, actually.
[02:17:03.318 --> 02:17:05.079]  It wasn't that long ago at all.
[02:17:05.079 --> 02:17:06.701]  You know, my father thinks that
[02:17:27.967 --> 02:17:46.698]  You know, they're trying to pick a fight with China, they want a world war, then they want a... You know, I worked my father up to this, 9-11, and he said for years, you know, that I was just, you know, just crazy, but after I showed him some videos, he's... And yeah, he's pretty well on about it too now.
[02:17:46.698 --> 02:17:53.562]  So you're working in China, and you can't go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com?
[02:17:53.562 --> 02:17:55.543]  That's right, only with a proxy changer.
[02:17:57.148 --> 02:17:57.889]  That's the only way.
[02:17:57.889 --> 02:18:00.471]  Well, yeah, I can if I use the proxy changer.
[02:18:00.471 --> 02:18:05.435]  I've just kept your number in my Skype, and I'm calling from Skype, so that's what I'm doing now.
[02:18:05.435 --> 02:18:06.096]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:18:20.248 --> 02:18:21.609]  No, no, that's fine.
[02:18:21.609 --> 02:18:27.231]  Well, I mean, hold on a second, Brian, because I want Red to be able to comment, and then you can come back and comment as well, and I don't want you to go yet.
[02:18:27.231 --> 02:18:29.472]  Red, a separate issue.
[02:18:29.472 --> 02:18:41.877]  Is this the globalist panicking that not just China, but the UN itself, Bill Gates, the Obama administration, Cass Sunstein say they are going to, quote, ban criticism of the government on the web?
[02:18:41.877 --> 02:18:46.699]  I mean, they're openly saying it, and it's in a few newspapers, but not that big of a deal, I guess.
[02:18:47.831 --> 02:18:52.334]  Uh, you know, uh, it's kind of a compliment.
[02:18:52.334 --> 02:18:56.757]  Uh, when they talk about that, you know that we're very, very effective.
[02:18:59.006 --> 02:19:06.271]  They're concerned because people, we've got the truth and they've got the lie.
[02:19:06.271 --> 02:19:12.675]  And the lie always comes in second when the truth is there, when the truth is exposed.
[02:19:12.675 --> 02:19:22.341]  And so when they talk about doing something about the Internet, it tells you how worried they are about the truth that's coming out.
[02:19:22.341 --> 02:19:23.182]  They're scared to death.
[02:19:23.940 --> 02:19:24.621]  Absolutely.
[02:19:24.621 --> 02:19:35.388]  We need to find out if our auxiliary sites are down, if people can't get to those as well in China.
[02:19:35.388 --> 02:19:36.789]  Anything else, Brian, from China?
[02:19:36.789 --> 02:19:49.977]  No, I'll just find out how many sites have been banned, and I'll send you an email on your side, because I can't get there with the proxy changer, so I'll just let you know after I check it out.
[02:19:49.977 --> 02:19:51.218]  God bless you, Brian.
[02:19:51.218 --> 02:19:52.339]  Sorry I said from Canada.
[02:19:53.954 --> 02:19:56.216]  And send it to Paul Watson and Curt Nemo.
[02:19:56.216 --> 02:19:56.976]  God bless you.
[02:19:56.976 --> 02:19:58.277]  Be right back with Red Beckman-Moore.
[02:19:58.277 --> 02:20:05.243]  Your phone calls.
[02:20:05.243 --> 02:20:08.145]  Our economy is in great distress.
[02:20:08.145 --> 02:20:11.688]  The financial dominoes can fall at any time.
[02:20:11.688 --> 02:20:17.192]  It's time to stop hoping it doesn't happen and prepare just in case it does.
[02:20:17.192 --> 02:20:19.874]  You have auto and home insurance.
[02:20:19.874 --> 02:20:21.916]  Why wouldn't you have food insurance?
[02:20:23.052 --> 02:20:26.355]  Are you prepared to feed your family long-term?
[02:20:26.355 --> 02:20:28.997]  Because it might take years to recover.
[02:20:28.997 --> 02:20:35.563]  As the adult, it's your responsibility to feed your family, especially during rough times.
[02:20:35.563 --> 02:20:42.890]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is offering a package that will give you a 3-acre heirloom vegetable garden anywhere.
[02:20:42.890 --> 02:20:49.976]  50 heirloom varieties, 8,000 vegetable seeds, over 5 pounds of healthy food,
[02:20:50.968 --> 02:20:55.449]  Don't be fooled by marketing companies disguised as patriots.
[02:20:55.449 --> 02:21:04.852]  Survivalistseeds.com is owned by Big John Lipscomb, host of Don't Tread on Me radio show.
[02:21:04.852 --> 02:21:08.873]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:21:08.873 --> 02:21:12.114]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:21:12.114 --> 02:21:13.514]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:21:14.224 --> 02:21:16.906]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:21:16.906 --> 02:21:23.292]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:21:23.292 --> 02:21:28.496]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:21:28.496 --> 02:21:38.484]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:21:38.584 --> 02:21:40.946]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:21:40.946 --> 02:21:42.528]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:21:42.528 --> 02:21:44.990]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:21:44.990 --> 02:21:47.113]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:21:47.113 --> 02:21:52.258]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[02:22:04.187 --> 02:22:08.771]  Hello, this is Peter Cronschnabel from Midas Resources, and I'd like to share some thoughts with you.
[02:22:08.771 --> 02:22:21.121]  In today's economy, with the government spending gone wild, the banking system on the verge of collapse, and Wall Street in continuous freefall, we both know that it is critical that you protect your savings and retirement programs now.
[02:22:21.121 --> 02:22:26.706]  Macroeconomics can be very confusing, but the solution to securing your personal assets is very simple.
[02:22:26.706 --> 02:22:28.147]  It's purchase of gold and silver.
[02:22:28.687 --> 02:22:34.672]  These precious metals have been the trusted means of exchange for centuries, and they've never been more important in our country's history.
[02:22:35.353 --> 02:22:39.674]  It's up to you to design your survival plan, one based on gold and silver.
[02:22:39.674 --> 02:22:40.454]  Give me a call.
[02:22:40.454 --> 02:22:49.216]  I'm Peter Kronschnabel at 800-686-2237, extension 108, and allow me to outline an easy answer to your questions.
[02:22:49.216 --> 02:22:51.017]  That's Peter Kronschnabel at 1-800-686-2237, extension 108.
[02:22:51.017 --> 02:22:55.237]  Call Peter at 1-800-686-2237, extension 108, where you can still purchase gold with paper.
[02:23:03.228 --> 02:23:06.772]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[02:23:06.772 --> 02:23:09.054]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[02:23:09.054 --> 02:23:09.935]  Don't!
[02:23:09.935 --> 02:23:13.378]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[02:23:13.378 --> 02:23:22.467]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb Kay's number one debt secret.
[02:23:22.467 --> 02:23:26.131]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[02:23:26.511 --> 02:23:29.653]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[02:23:29.653 --> 02:23:37.039]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[02:23:37.039 --> 02:23:38.219]  Herb K was right.
[02:23:38.219 --> 02:23:41.402]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[02:23:41.402 --> 02:23:42.763]  What have you got to lose?
[02:23:42.763 --> 02:23:46.465]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money.
[02:23:46.465 --> 02:23:50.408]  Get Herb K's number one debt secret absolutely free now.
[02:23:50.408 --> 02:23:50.708]  Call 888-352-7726.
[02:23:54.851 --> 02:23:55.571]  That's 888-352-7726.
[02:23:55.571 --> 02:23:56.151]  888-352.
[02:23:56.151 --> 02:23:59.392]  He's bounded down, loaded up and truckin'.
[02:23:59.392 --> 02:24:03.273]  We're gonna do what they say can't be done.
[02:24:03.273 --> 02:24:07.354]  We've got a long way to go, and a short time to get back.
[02:24:32.837 --> 02:24:35.239]  Keep exposing the tyrants.
[02:24:35.239 --> 02:24:37.560]  Continue standing against them.
[02:24:37.560 --> 02:24:39.782]  They will fall.
[02:24:39.782 --> 02:24:41.063]  Red Beckman is our guest.
[02:24:41.063 --> 02:24:48.788]  Coming up, I'm gonna get him to break down the militia, the history of it, why he wrote the book, why the militia.
[02:24:48.788 --> 02:24:50.349]  But right now, we're going back to your calls.
[02:24:50.349 --> 02:24:52.231]  Nick in North Carolina, you're on the air.
[02:24:52.231 --> 02:24:54.792]  Thanks for holding.
[02:24:54.792 --> 02:24:57.274]  Hey Alex and Red.
[02:24:57.274 --> 02:24:57.594]  Welcome.
[02:24:59.213 --> 02:25:03.135]  I have a question in regard to lawful government.
[02:25:03.135 --> 02:25:15.579]  Red, do Americans still have a true de jure government or a criminal de facto offshore banking cartel posing as our government called the United States of America?
[02:25:15.579 --> 02:25:26.844]  Well, the government that we have in Washington, D.C., it is not the government that we had
[02:25:28.100 --> 02:25:35.124]  When the Constitution, it isn't the government that was created by the Constitution.
[02:25:35.124 --> 02:25:43.608]  And of course, I don't get into that too much because it is a very evil system the way it is today.
[02:25:43.608 --> 02:25:49.131]  But you see, I say we the people have to take the blame for it.
[02:25:49.131 --> 02:25:51.672]  And that's where we have to start making the correction.
[02:25:53.612 --> 02:26:01.639]  It is we the people who let this bunch of outlaws get control of our system.
[02:26:01.639 --> 02:26:05.482]  And we are the ones that have to take it back if we want to be free.
[02:26:05.482 --> 02:26:09.846]  If we want liberty and freedom, we're going to have to take our power back.
[02:26:11.576 --> 02:26:25.483]  You know, they taught us about the separation of powers in our high school government classes, and they talked about the separation of powers between the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government.
[02:26:25.483 --> 02:26:30.026]  They never said a word about the power of the individual.
[02:26:30.026 --> 02:26:34.348]  They didn't say anything about my power that I have and your power.
[02:26:34.989 --> 02:26:48.920]  They told us that the legislative and executive branch and the judicial branch, they were to jealously guard their powers as enumerated in the Constitution.
[02:26:48.920 --> 02:26:57.988]  Well, you and I, we were never taught how to jealously protect our powers as individuals.
[02:26:57.988 --> 02:26:58.889]  Here's a question.
[02:27:00.034 --> 02:27:11.279]  The Supreme Court ruling, as I read it, says that offshore private corporations can give unlimited money, but still individuals are barred down to $3,000 per candidate.
[02:27:11.279 --> 02:27:20.164]  And so what they've done is they've bound the individual while unleashing the tyrannical foreign corporations.
[02:27:20.164 --> 02:27:22.965]  So, again, more signs of their desperation.
[02:27:23.447 --> 02:27:25.128]  Yes.
[02:27:25.128 --> 02:27:36.152]  You know, I think that that's great that the Supreme Court made that ruling because it got a lot of people's attention.
[02:27:36.152 --> 02:27:45.936]  And that's what we need is people that all of a sudden they get hit with something like this and they say, my goodness, how could this happen?
[02:27:45.936 --> 02:27:53.139]  And so they start searching and they start listening to Alex Jones and others and they get an education.
[02:27:53.986 --> 02:28:10.754]  And, uh, so, um, and of course, uh, the Tea Party people, if, uh, and, and, and the, the power out there, uh, amongst the people that, on our side, you know, that understand where we're at.
[02:28:10.754 --> 02:28:16.397]  The power that they have is so fabulous if they use it properly.
[02:28:16.397 --> 02:28:21.819]  And that is, you see, they've got to start identifying all of the 435 members of the
[02:28:24.437 --> 02:28:30.318]  They have to run for re-election or somebody else will take their seat in the Congress.
[02:28:30.318 --> 02:28:40.080]  What we need to do is identify, in each legislative district, we have to identify the incumbent.
[02:28:40.080 --> 02:28:45.681]  Is he a Karl Marx Democrat or is he a Karl Marx Republican?
[02:28:45.681 --> 02:28:53.142]  You see Karl Marx Democrats and Karl Marx Republicans are easy to identify because they want gun control.
[02:28:53.677 --> 02:28:56.098]  And let me go further here.
[02:28:56.098 --> 02:29:05.122]  The spin with this ruling is, oh, the government, McCain-Feingold, wouldn't let a corporation fund a Hillary movie.
[02:29:05.122 --> 02:29:09.564]  Now, they would have limitedly said, yeah, corporations can make their own movies.
[02:29:09.564 --> 02:29:10.625]  No.
[02:29:10.625 --> 02:29:11.445]  They didn't say that.
[02:29:11.445 --> 02:29:15.767]  They said, OK, unlimited for the corporations, but the citizens are bound.
[02:29:15.767 --> 02:29:21.170]  Again, that shows how the Tea Parties are even fooled by this, at least currently, some of them.
[02:29:21.730 --> 02:29:23.911]  Thinking, oh, this was a free speech move.
[02:29:23.911 --> 02:29:24.612]  No.
[02:29:24.612 --> 02:29:26.473]  Again, it's more deception.
[02:29:26.473 --> 02:29:27.854]  But I appreciate your call, Nick.
[02:29:27.854 --> 02:29:29.135]  We're gonna try to hurry through calls now.
[02:29:29.135 --> 02:29:34.478]  Mark, Karen, Kenneth, Kaleo in Hawaii, and others.
[02:29:34.478 --> 02:29:36.239]  Straight ahead, long segment coming up.
[02:29:36.239 --> 02:29:38.141]  Red Beckman with us till the end of the hour.
[02:29:38.141 --> 02:29:40.662]  Gotta have him up more often than once a year.
[02:29:40.662 --> 02:29:42.724]  Well, also, before he leaves, let's give you that address.
[02:29:42.724 --> 02:29:45.505]  Ten bucks, two books, delivered to you.
[02:29:45.505 --> 02:29:48.247]  He's basically sending them to you at cost.
[02:29:48.247 --> 02:29:49.108]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:29:51.707 --> 02:29:54.729]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.729 --> 02:30:00.933]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.933 --> 02:30:06.256]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[02:30:06.256 --> 02:30:08.998]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[02:30:08.998 --> 02:30:14.321]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[02:30:14.321 --> 02:30:15.742]  Friends, I hope that you will order
[02:30:15.742 --> 02:30:18.803]  Order Shadow Government from Infowars.com.

[02:31:01.363 --> 02:31:04.365]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:31:04.365 --> 02:31:09.708]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:31:09.708 --> 02:31:11.749]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:31:11.749 --> 02:31:16.753]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:31:16.753 --> 02:31:17.933]  How much do you want?
[02:31:17.933 --> 02:31:19.054]  When do you want it?
[02:31:19.054 --> 02:31:20.935]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:31:20.935 --> 02:31:22.016]  When will you need it?
[02:31:22.016 --> 02:31:24.217]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:31:24.217 --> 02:31:25.558]  Will there be any food?
[02:31:25.558 --> 02:31:26.859]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:31:27.079 --> 02:31:32.343]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:31:32.343 --> 02:31:35.925]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:31:35.925 --> 02:31:39.748]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:31:39.748 --> 02:31:40.989]  How much will you need?
[02:31:40.989 --> 02:31:41.870]  We don't know.
[02:31:41.870 --> 02:31:42.971]  How much do you want?
[02:31:42.971 --> 02:31:43.731]  All you can get.
[02:31:43.731 --> 02:31:44.732]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:31:44.992 --> 02:31:48.056]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[02:32:00.697 --> 02:32:01.857]  What's your home worth?
[02:32:01.857 --> 02:32:03.978]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[02:32:03.978 --> 02:32:07.019]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[02:32:07.019 --> 02:32:14.721]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.

[02:33:07.799 --> 02:33:13.404]  Well, I'm not the kind to kiss and tell, but I've been seen with Farrah.
[02:33:13.404 --> 02:33:18.889]  I've never been with anything less than a dime, so fine.
[02:33:18.889 --> 02:33:24.294]  I've been on fire with Sally Field, gone fast with a girl named Bo.
[02:33:24.294 --> 02:33:27.877]  But somehow they just don't end up as mine.
[02:33:28.809 --> 02:33:34.971]  I got a big news blitz coming up in the next hour continuing with your phone calls and we're going to briefly look at Agent Orange.
[02:33:34.971 --> 02:33:45.035]  I know most people know it's deadly but the fact is the government knew day one it was deadly and tried to block funding to the military veterans and their families just like they're doing with DU.
[02:33:45.035 --> 02:33:52.537]  Another message to the enforcers of the fact that the system could care less about you and we better all stick together against the new world order.
[02:33:52.537 --> 02:33:55.939]  Your calls coming up and why the militia with Red Beckman.
[02:33:55.939 --> 02:33:56.699]  Before I do that
[02:33:58.035 --> 02:34:01.479]  Become a walking, talking billboard for truth.
[02:34:01.479 --> 02:34:03.322]  Like look at this t-shirt, one of our best sellers.
[02:34:03.322 --> 02:34:04.083]  Come and take it.
[02:34:04.083 --> 02:34:06.105]  Infowars.com.
[02:34:06.105 --> 02:34:13.714]  That was the Texas slogan when the Mexican government came to confiscate the guns in 1836 and my ancestors fought back against the tyranny.
[02:34:14.235 --> 02:34:18.278]  Get these shirts at InfoWars.com and they're very inexpensive.
[02:34:18.278 --> 02:34:23.802]  Some t-shirts are $5.95, $9.95, ball caps, free t-shirts when you order videos.
[02:34:23.802 --> 02:34:26.924]  It's all available at InfoWars.com.
[02:34:26.924 --> 02:34:29.366]  We also have these two new shirts in.
[02:34:29.366 --> 02:34:31.727]  This one's like a football practice jersey.
[02:34:31.727 --> 02:34:34.309]  Defend Freedom with a Minute Man with a Bullhorn.
[02:34:34.309 --> 02:34:35.470]  InfoWars.com.
[02:34:37.031 --> 02:34:43.975]  And we have this new t-shirt, also the Defend Freedom slogan there, with a Minuteman on the front.
[02:34:43.975 --> 02:34:46.777]  People ask you, well, how do you defend freedom?
[02:34:46.777 --> 02:34:49.279]  Infowars.com, giant on the back.
[02:34:49.279 --> 02:34:57.464]  It says, join the resistance, Infowars.com, ladies and gentlemen, and all the books, all the videos, all the materials.
[02:34:57.464 --> 02:34:58.305]  You're awake now!
[02:34:59.105 --> 02:35:05.113]  But your friends, your family, your neighbors, they know something's wrong, now you've got to give them the films.
[02:35:05.113 --> 02:35:11.702]  Like Fall of the Republic, Obama Deception, How Weed Won the West, Exposing the Phony Drug Dealing Government Operation.
[02:35:11.702 --> 02:35:15.167]  All available at InfoWars.com or by calling toll free 888-

[02:35:47.653 --> 02:35:59.136]  Box 6-1, Carrolls, C-A-R-R-O-L-L-S, Carrolls, Washington, and the zip here is 98609.
[02:35:59.136 --> 02:36:04.377]  And anybody will send a $10.
[02:36:04.377 --> 02:36:10.439]  The last time I was on, we sold the Little Book Walls on our minds, and I'm sure everybody that got that book
[02:36:11.534 --> 02:36:21.067]  I could use another one, so we'll send you a copy of that, and we'll send you a copy of Why the Militia, which is a considerably larger book.
[02:36:21.067 --> 02:36:28.276]  And we'll pay the postage and the whole work, so that's a special deal for Alex and his show.
[02:36:29.360 --> 02:36:30.801]  Well, you're a sweetheart, Red.
[02:36:30.801 --> 02:36:50.293]  Now, I want to pick your brain about the militia, I mean, for myself and for everybody else, because I constantly, and we're going to take calls and then get to that, I constantly, when MSNBC is here, or Atlantic Monthly is here, or Texas Monthly, or the Dallas Morning News, or whoever it is, they say, what about militias?
[02:36:50.293 --> 02:36:51.094]  Are you for that?
[02:36:51.094 --> 02:36:57.318]  And I say, well, it's in the Constitution, it's in the Bill of Rights, it's what the Posse is, it's what civil defense is,
[02:36:58.078 --> 02:37:02.499]  And I try to explain to them, but the government provocateurs groups to demonize it.
[02:37:02.499 --> 02:37:08.600]  And I try to break that down, but I want to get your take on why the militia and how important it is coming up.
[02:37:08.600 --> 02:37:10.440]  But right now, let's hurry through calls.
[02:37:10.440 --> 02:37:13.561]  Mark in Georgia, you're on the air with Red Beckman.
[02:37:13.561 --> 02:37:14.621]  God bless you, sir.
[02:37:14.621 --> 02:37:16.161]  Ever in our prayers.
[02:37:16.161 --> 02:37:17.101]  Can you hear me okay?
[02:37:17.101 --> 02:37:18.101]  Yes, I can.
[02:37:18.101 --> 02:37:18.582]  Okay.
[02:37:18.582 --> 02:37:27.203]  Item one, I would like to see about, I understand you get annoyed about people who want you to do more, like you haven't given your hat and your coat and everything to this
[02:37:27.705 --> 02:37:35.388]  Because I would like to see about getting a crew of volunteers to help you deal with all the massive emails you get.
[02:37:35.388 --> 02:37:46.812]  I'd like to see about helping getting people together to say we'd like to help you sort through all this massive amount of incoming information and help you answer all the questions that people are asking.
[02:37:46.812 --> 02:37:53.855]  What I'd like to see, let me very briefly outline a video production I'd like to have called We The Jury.
[02:37:54.639 --> 02:37:58.841]  Where we have, it's just like Pilgrim's Progress, you can tell the characters by their names.
[02:37:58.841 --> 02:38:01.563]  Pat Riott, go figure, he's Patriot.
[02:38:01.563 --> 02:38:03.824]  And he's dying of depleted uranium.
[02:38:03.824 --> 02:38:07.726]  And because you have a character that looks a lot like Lon Horiuchi in Go Who?
[02:38:07.726 --> 02:38:10.547]  The guy who murdered Sarah Weaver at Ruby Ridge.
[02:38:10.547 --> 02:38:13.789]  And Pat's writing to everyone, nobody's doing anything.
[02:38:13.789 --> 02:38:21.933]  And Pat takes actions that will suffice to say would not be called for in a lawful government that was doing what was right.
[02:38:22.714 --> 02:38:29.619]  But then if that were the case, then Juan would never have dared murder Sarah Weaver.
[02:38:29.619 --> 02:38:30.840]  Hold on just a minute, Mark.
[02:38:30.840 --> 02:38:32.341]  I'm going to put you on hold for a minute.
[02:38:32.341 --> 02:38:34.203]  Here's the deal.
[02:38:34.203 --> 02:38:40.808]  It isn't that I don't like people giving me ideas, and it isn't that I don't like people telling me I need to do this or do that.
[02:38:40.808 --> 02:38:43.049]  It's that, you know, take...
[02:38:44.522 --> 02:38:54.646]  People, like Ron Paul has asked me to come speak at big events and I just don't have the time because I can electronically reach ten times as many people in the time it would take to drive to Houston.
[02:38:54.646 --> 02:39:00.268]  And when I do show up at events, they have provocateurs that try to stir stuff up and create a distraction.
[02:39:00.268 --> 02:39:02.288]  I mean, it's literally by the book.
[02:39:02.288 --> 02:39:05.509]  So maybe I should be out at more events because the system doesn't like it.
[02:39:05.509 --> 02:39:05.910]  Also,
[02:39:08.865 --> 02:39:14.207]  You know, there have been, like, let's see, Jordan Maxwell keeps begging me to come make a film with his material.
[02:39:14.207 --> 02:39:15.227]  I'd love to.
[02:39:15.227 --> 02:39:18.989]  I can't even get my own films done.
[02:39:18.989 --> 02:39:30.413]  Again, we're lean and mean, and I'm not saying you're bad, Mark, but if I let 20 people in my office, guaranteed five of them will be feds, and they'd be trying to put me in prison within hours.
[02:39:30.413 --> 02:39:33.394]  And again, I don't talk a lot about this, but we're under attack.
[02:39:34.775 --> 02:39:35.015]  Absolutely.
[02:39:35.015 --> 02:39:35.215]  Absolutely.
[02:40:01.345 --> 02:40:05.471]  I mean, any comments on your experiences dealing with provocateurs and stuff?
[02:40:05.471 --> 02:40:11.359]  Well, I've been able to identify a number of them over the years.
[02:40:12.603 --> 02:40:18.949]  And they're not too hard to spot after a bit.
[02:40:18.949 --> 02:40:37.566]  They'll try to ingratiate themselves with you in one thing or another, and they may spend some money for books and things like that, but they will invariably end up trying to tell you and get you motivated to do something that would be a violation of law.
[02:40:39.008 --> 02:40:52.417]  And so if you have somebody come in and try to be nicey-nice, and the first thing you know they're telling you that you ought to do this or do that.
[02:40:52.417 --> 02:41:01.103]  Or they use the credibility of being within your operation to go tell people you're talking bad about them when you're not, just to start infighting.
[02:41:01.103 --> 02:41:07.428]  Well, they're there, and of course, having all of these thousands of different organizations
[02:41:08.874 --> 02:41:20.397]  You know, in Montana, I still have a footprint there, and I told the people there, I said, every organization have a different, pick a different name.
[02:41:20.397 --> 02:41:32.441]  And one of them, they call themselves Montana, oh my goodness, I'm a senior moment.
[02:41:32.441 --> 02:41:37.562]  From Anne Ryan's book, Atlas Shrugged, they call themselves Montana Shrugged.
[02:41:38.664 --> 02:41:44.270]  And they have hundreds, hundreds of people in their organization.
[02:41:44.270 --> 02:41:50.716]  They're all put together or connected electronically.
[02:41:50.716 --> 02:41:53.899]  And what a name.
[02:41:53.899 --> 02:41:54.920]  Montana Shrugged.
[02:41:55.276 --> 02:42:02.281]  And then they're connected to other groups, and it's a headless system to where the enemy can't defeat it.
[02:42:02.281 --> 02:42:06.844]  But Mark, write up your ideas, send it to us at InfoWars.com.
[02:42:06.844 --> 02:42:11.827]  It would be great to be able to go through all the tips, all the stuff we miss, all the things we do.
[02:42:11.827 --> 02:42:18.992]  It's just that I also want to encourage listeners to not wish you could work for me, or wish you could work with us, or wish you could.
[02:42:18.992 --> 02:42:20.173]  You're out there as leaders.
[02:42:20.173 --> 02:42:21.293]  Start your own organization.
[02:42:21.293 --> 02:42:23.775]  If you believe in our information, post it, share it.
[02:42:25.689 --> 02:42:31.534]  Again, we're about getting you to take action, not for us to then go do more.
[02:42:31.534 --> 02:42:40.021]  Because I really physically can't do much more, except work smarter and launch new electronic operations against the enemy to spread our information more.
[02:42:40.021 --> 02:42:42.362]  And it's you, the listeners, that make that so effective.
[02:42:42.362 --> 02:42:43.664]  Let's go to Karen in Oregon.
[02:42:43.664 --> 02:42:47.487]  Karen, you're on the air.
[02:42:47.487 --> 02:42:50.369]  Thank you very much for all you do for the Patriot Movement.
[02:42:51.112 --> 02:42:55.475]  The other day I was listening to you and Mike Rivero mentioned the national strike.
[02:42:55.475 --> 02:43:10.447]  Well, I am hoping to put that together and our goals are no global government, restore our Constitution, individual sovereignty, state sovereignty, limited federal government, no more voting machines or taxation without representation.
[02:43:10.447 --> 02:43:16.211]  What we are trying to do here is unite all of the fractionated groups all across this great country
[02:43:16.710 --> 02:43:26.879]  And have them get on the freedom train and totally, economically withdraw and support this national strike April 15th through April 18th.
[02:43:26.879 --> 02:43:28.140]  Can you endorse this?
[02:43:29.158 --> 02:43:30.099]  Well, I have endorsed.
[02:43:30.099 --> 02:43:35.822]  I've said people on the 15th should not just have a strike against the New World Order.
[02:43:35.822 --> 02:43:51.133]  They should call the local media and tell them a strike's being organized in Austin or Dallas or New York or Portland or wherever it is, and have everybody call them to talk radio, send letters to the editor, have protests on that day as well.
[02:43:51.133 --> 02:43:54.915]  And we don't need to have one big centralized, organized hub.
[02:43:54.915 --> 02:43:58.758]  But yes, I do support a national demonstration and strike
[02:43:59.518 --> 02:44:01.899]  Yes, I think that that is going to be a landmark
[02:44:14.304 --> 02:44:19.748]  In American history, I think it's going to happen.
[02:44:19.748 --> 02:44:23.090]  I think it's going to be big, big, big.
[02:44:23.090 --> 02:44:32.697]  I was just looking through the book, Why the Militia, and I had some comments in here about the press.
[02:44:32.697 --> 02:44:42.044]  We were talking about the Supreme Court decision letting corporations spend money for campaigns.
[02:44:43.157 --> 02:44:52.264]  Well, you know, they're going to be wasting their money because people are not very dependent anymore on major media.
[02:44:52.264 --> 02:44:58.029]  And I had a comment, two or three of them here, when I had a chapter on the media.
[02:44:58.029 --> 02:45:09.498]  I said, if you believe without question what you see and hear coming from major media, you are an exhibit proving that propaganda and lies can inflict serious brain damage.
[02:45:10.874 --> 02:45:15.156]  And then another one, major media personalities live for a living.
[02:45:15.156 --> 02:45:20.357]  Seven-figure incomes can cause a person to misplace his conscience.
[02:45:20.357 --> 02:45:27.420]  And then one, most of the millions spent during political campaigns end up in the pockets of the media.
[02:45:27.420 --> 02:45:32.581]  The media get the money and the people get a choice between two evils.
[02:45:32.581 --> 02:45:34.122]  Those days are over.
[02:45:34.795 --> 02:45:39.437]  For the big money to come in and buy an election.
[02:45:39.437 --> 02:45:53.663]  Because the newspapers, the media, the television media and such, they're panicking because the newspapers, how many newspapers have gone bankrupt?
[02:45:53.663 --> 02:45:59.145]  And you're going to hear about major media, TV and such, that they're going to be going bankrupt too.
[02:46:00.300 --> 02:46:08.124]  And people don't, they're just not relying on those media for their information.
[02:46:08.124 --> 02:46:17.650]  And so let them corporations, those foreign corporations come in and spend their money with the media, and we'll just bum our nose at the media.
[02:46:17.650 --> 02:46:20.912]  Well that's right, and I appreciate your call ma'am.
[02:46:24.929 --> 02:46:26.650]  The globalists are dead on arrival.
[02:46:26.650 --> 02:46:31.293]  They're going to get their world government, but it's going to die the day it's finally established.
[02:46:31.293 --> 02:46:33.935]  Because humanity doesn't want to be slaves.
[02:46:33.935 --> 02:46:38.918]  And they want to use poverty and degradation to control us, but it's just not going to work forever.
[02:46:38.918 --> 02:46:42.201]  And the mainstream media isn't just dying because of the internet.
[02:46:42.201 --> 02:46:49.245]  They are clearly dying in all the polls and studies, because people know they're a pack of spinning, twisting, deceiving liars.
[02:46:53.035 --> 02:46:54.415]  Let's go back to the phone calls.
[02:46:54.415 --> 02:46:56.096]  Let's talk to Kenneth in Texas.
[02:46:56.096 --> 02:46:56.816]  Kenneth, go ahead.
[02:46:56.816 --> 02:46:59.397]  Hi Alex, thank you for taking my call.
[02:46:59.397 --> 02:47:02.578]  I know you're trying to get to a lot of calls, so I'll go ahead and make this brief.
[02:47:02.578 --> 02:47:07.999]  I heard y'all talking earlier about how the Germans were defecting during the Revolutionary War, I believe it was.
[02:47:07.999 --> 02:47:14.081]  And I wanted to highlight back in the late 90s when members of the NWO were defecting
[02:47:14.716 --> 02:47:26.359]  I think we should kind of get a movement like that going again by bringing back the NWO Wolfpack where Kevin Nash and Lex Luger and all of them left the NWO.
[02:47:26.359 --> 02:47:28.299]  I appreciate your call.
[02:47:28.299 --> 02:47:29.960]  That's very funny.
[02:47:29.960 --> 02:47:33.381]  He's talking about, I guess, Hulk Hogan or something.
[02:47:33.381 --> 02:47:41.043]  Let's go ahead now and talk to Kaleo, I believe, or K-Lo from Hawaii.
[02:47:41.043 --> 02:47:41.683]  You're on the air.
[02:47:41.683 --> 02:47:42.063]  Go ahead.
[02:47:44.192 --> 02:47:45.392]  Hello, Alex.
[02:47:45.392 --> 02:47:46.412]  Welcome.
[02:47:46.412 --> 02:47:47.613]  Yes.
[02:47:47.613 --> 02:47:54.294]  Listen, I want you to know that you've been a great blessing for us here in Hawaii.
[02:47:54.294 --> 02:48:08.956]  Indirectly, you've also been a great blessing for the Hawaiian Sovereignty Movement because the Hawaiian Sovereignty Movement, we've been fighting the New World Order since 1893, since the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom by British and American businessmen.
[02:48:08.956 --> 02:48:12.177]  They came and just killed your leaders and took over.
[02:48:13.359 --> 02:48:24.225]  Pretty much, they actually overthrew Markey with gunboat diplomacy, and actually America was supposed to be the
[02:48:27.646 --> 02:48:28.086]  I think?
[02:48:51.812 --> 02:48:52.173]  I don't know.
[02:49:00.686 --> 02:49:06.690]  We had the Joker shirts and we kind of hid them underneath all of our shirts.
[02:49:06.690 --> 02:49:14.255]  As he was pulling into his complex, you know, he was smiling and we opened up the shirts and you saw it and you could see his face just drop.
[02:49:14.255 --> 02:49:17.998]  You could tell he was really kind of, he was a little rattled by it.
[02:49:30.866 --> 02:49:33.227]  Absolutely.
[02:49:33.227 --> 02:49:39.251]  In some respects, Obama's the best thing that's happened to our country in a long while.
[02:49:39.251 --> 02:49:41.292]  From Hawaii, anything else, sir?
[02:49:41.292 --> 02:49:43.333]  Is it Kaleo?
[02:49:43.333 --> 02:49:44.334]  How do I pronounce your name?
[02:49:44.334 --> 02:49:44.894]  Kaleo?
[02:49:44.894 --> 02:49:47.075]  It's Kaleo.
[02:49:47.075 --> 02:49:47.656]  Okay, great.
[02:49:47.656 --> 02:49:48.076]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:49:49.062 --> 02:50:08.620]  Yeah, so, you know, and when he saw, you know, this is his home state, so, you know, seeing that people in his home state are hip to the deception and the lie of the New World Order, and we realize that he's a puppet, I think it had a rattling effect on him, because I think he comes to life to try to get away, get away from all of that.
[02:50:08.620 --> 02:50:14.566]  And when he comes back here and he's confronted with that same reality, it's almost a look in the mirror, you know?
[02:50:15.208 --> 02:50:20.514]  Oh, it's very important just to let the globalists know that we're aware of them and don't like them.
[02:50:20.514 --> 02:50:24.339]  Because they get off on the fact that they're conning us.
[02:50:24.339 --> 02:50:24.699]  Right.
[02:50:24.699 --> 02:50:26.221]  That's absolutely right.
[02:50:26.221 --> 02:50:29.345]  But I just want you to know, you know, I was turned on.
[02:50:29.345 --> 02:50:30.847]  We have a radio station here.
[02:50:30.847 --> 02:50:33.309]  Really love to get your radio station streamed in here.
[02:50:33.309 --> 02:50:35.052]  We've been working a lot of productions through
[02:50:36.298 --> 02:50:38.700]  Local TV, actually public TV.
[02:50:38.700 --> 02:50:45.225]  A lot of your programs we've been airing on what they call Olelo, which is the speak or talk television.
[02:50:45.225 --> 02:50:49.028]  And a friend of mine who's a producer, he's been hearing a lot of your stuff.
[02:50:49.028 --> 02:50:51.189]  Well, tell him I said thank him.
[02:50:51.189 --> 02:50:53.411]  What's the radio station?
[02:50:53.411 --> 02:50:54.552]  It's called Olelo.
[02:50:54.552 --> 02:50:56.393]  It's a TV station.
[02:50:56.393 --> 02:50:58.795]  We've been airing your DVDs on that.
[02:50:58.795 --> 02:50:59.856]  Got it.
[02:50:59.856 --> 02:51:00.456]  You're awesome.
[02:51:00.456 --> 02:51:00.977]  God bless you.
[02:51:01.989 --> 02:51:04.150]  Is your computer running slowly?
[02:51:04.150 --> 02:51:05.911]  Thinking about buying a new one?
[02:51:05.911 --> 02:51:07.112]  Don't waste your money!
[02:51:07.112 --> 02:51:13.416]  Your computer could be infected with spyware, malware, viruses, registry errors, spam, and pop-ups.
[02:51:13.416 --> 02:51:15.117]  You don't need to buy a new computer.

[02:52:02.489 --> 02:52:06.516]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:52:06.516 --> 02:52:09.762]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:52:09.762 --> 02:52:11.185]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[02:52:11.883 --> 02:52:14.566]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:52:14.566 --> 02:52:20.952]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:20.952 --> 02:52:26.137]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:52:26.137 --> 02:52:29.320]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[02:52:29.320 --> 02:52:36.126]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:52:36.246 --> 02:52:38.588]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:52:38.588 --> 02:52:40.169]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:40.169 --> 02:52:42.631]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:42.631 --> 02:52:44.753]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:52:44.753 --> 02:52:49.917]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:52:49.917 --> 02:52:59.024]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:53:01.869 --> 02:53:08.573]  Why is drinking pure high alkaline pH water the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[02:53:08.573 --> 02:53:14.978]  Because alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[02:53:14.978 --> 02:53:21.302]  Disease organisms like bacteria, viruses, and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment.
[02:53:21.302 --> 02:53:26.205]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals.
[02:53:26.685 --> 02:53:34.856]  Using AlkaVision pH Drops is the best way to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[02:53:34.856 --> 02:53:39.462]  Simply put 10 drops in the water you drink to raise the pH to an alkaline level.
[02:53:39.462 --> 02:53:43.187]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[02:53:44.108 --> 02:53:49.852]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now by going directly to AlkaVision.com.

[02:53:54.054 --> 02:53:56.856]  Big news blitz coming up in the next hour.
[02:53:56.856 --> 02:53:58.137]  Red Beckman is our guest.
[02:54:15.353 --> 02:54:21.255]  I saw a story last week where Walgreens wouldn't develop photos of a man's gun collection for his insurance.
[02:54:21.255 --> 02:54:26.497]  You're supposed to take photos of your stereo, computer, stuff like that, guns.
[02:54:26.497 --> 02:54:28.197]  Just the image of a gun is now evil.
[02:54:28.197 --> 02:54:32.578]  With all the violence on TV, video games, police, that's all okay.
[02:54:32.578 --> 02:54:38.900]  But citizens with guns or the image of guns, they're trying to make it so taboo, but it's not working.
[02:54:38.900 --> 02:54:40.041]  This is New York Daily News.
[02:54:42.079 --> 02:54:58.464]  Timoney fumes after his son Patrick Nine, his dad's a cop, is busted for bringing a two-inch long toy gun, a plastic GI Joe gun for the GI Joe figure, and they're talking about kicking him out of school, arresting him, all this stuff.
[02:54:58.464 --> 02:55:04.365]  But the good news is people aren't buying into this mind control, just like they've demonized the militia.
[02:55:04.365 --> 02:55:07.086]  Red Beckman, you wrote Why the Militia.
[02:55:07.086 --> 02:55:09.407]  Explain to people what the militia really is.
[02:55:12.160 --> 02:55:23.485]  Is the people being armed and able to defend themselves from an oppressive government.
[02:55:23.485 --> 02:55:27.326]  I was just looking through the book here and I had a comment.
[02:55:27.326 --> 02:55:29.027]  Why the militia?
[02:55:29.027 --> 02:55:31.828]  And I said, for the same reasons we had in 1775.
[02:55:31.828 --> 02:55:35.069]  You remember the history of how the
[02:55:39.372 --> 02:55:55.025]  The British General in Boston ordered the troops to go out to Lexington and confiscate the powder and the shot that the patriots were collecting, anticipating a war or a revolution, whatever.
[02:55:55.025 --> 02:56:00.889]  And there's where the shot was fired, heard around the world.
[02:56:00.889 --> 02:56:02.130]  The same reasons.
[02:56:02.130 --> 02:56:05.733]  We've got the same reasons today that we had then.
[02:56:05.733 --> 02:56:07.114]  And I'll tell you,
[02:56:09.786 --> 02:56:25.076]  If you're not, if you haven't gotten yourself armed, my advice to you is do it and be part of this tremendous operation that we've got going in this country to restore our lawful government.
[02:56:25.076 --> 02:56:32.241]  And this detente, if they hit us, we're going to be equipped to hit them back.
[02:56:32.910 --> 02:56:55.816]  And we're going to hit them back a lot harder than they hit us, so they better not be playing games with their false flags and all of that, because they don't know when they're going to go just a little too far and trigger this reaction like we had in Concord Square back there on April 19th of 1775.
[02:56:58.502 --> 02:57:10.278]  And clearly, clearly that spirit is there because there's a lot of people that have a sense of desperation, they're sick of it, and they are ready, and I'm telling the establishment
[02:57:11.502 --> 02:57:12.543]  But the book, Why the Militia?
[02:57:33.941 --> 02:57:44.912]  Uh, explains how, uh, we can avoid having to go to that kind of, of, um, uh, effort to restore awful government.
[02:57:44.912 --> 02:57:51.277]  Uh, it brings out very strong the grand jury and the, and the pettit jury, uh, the trial jury and how they are to function.
[02:57:51.277 --> 02:57:54.000]  Uh, it talks about the Federal Reserve Bank.
[02:57:54.000 --> 02:57:58.224]  And by the way, when have you heard anybody talking?
[02:57:59.298 --> 02:58:12.448]  About what happens to the Federal Reserve if we could abolish the Federal Reserve and if the assets of the Federal Reserve was restored to the Treasury of the United States.
[02:58:12.448 --> 02:58:13.409]  Stop right there, Red.
[02:58:13.409 --> 02:58:17.291]  I'm going to twist your arm for five more because you brought that up.
[02:58:17.291 --> 02:58:20.214]  I want you to be able to flesh that out because remember what just happened in Iceland.
[02:58:20.914 --> 02:58:31.399]  They were telling the country they owed five times their entire wealth to the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve when they had run the scam on record to rob them.
[02:58:31.399 --> 02:58:39.362]  And when the public finally said no, the banks went, oh look, we actually have the assets to pay this off.
[02:58:39.362 --> 02:58:41.383]  Stay there.
[02:58:41.383 --> 02:58:45.625]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over

[02:59:54.044 --> 02:59:56.445]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.445 --> 02:59:59.207]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[03:00:03.027 --> 03:00:06.628]  Breaking news, ladies and gentlemen, into hour number four.
[03:00:06.628 --> 03:00:14.931]  Mark Dice, another devastating coup against the New World Order on one of the number one TV stations in California, reaching millions of people.
[03:00:14.931 --> 03:00:19.213]  A devastating guerrilla warfare info attack.
[03:00:20.594 --> 03:00:23.095]  And everybody can do what Mark Dice is doing, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:00:23.095 --> 03:00:26.096]  He will teach us.
[03:00:26.096 --> 03:00:27.017]  He knows what he's doing.
[03:00:27.017 --> 03:00:31.298]  Just like I can teach you something, he can teach you something, you can teach me something.
[03:00:31.298 --> 03:00:33.719]  Red Beckman can teach us so much.
[03:00:33.719 --> 03:00:34.940]  All of us.
[03:00:34.940 --> 03:00:46.344]  I'm just an average guy from Dallas, Texas, who's red-blooded and loves freedom, and I found out about the New World Order and their own quotes and their plan, and I said, I'm not going to be a slave.
[03:00:46.344 --> 03:00:48.425]  And let me tell you something, if I thought I fought hard,
[03:00:49.005 --> 03:00:56.892]  Eight years ago, when I had my first child with my wife, I began to fight even harder and fully commit myself.
[03:00:56.892 --> 03:00:59.154]  I mean, I thought I was fighting hard before.
[03:00:59.154 --> 03:01:00.876]  Now I'm fighting for their life.
[03:01:00.876 --> 03:01:03.178]  I don't really care about my life.
[03:01:03.178 --> 03:01:12.086]  When you've been fighting this long and this hard and been persecuted like I have, Red Beckman's had his house bulldozed and he never even talks about all the persecution he's gone through.
[03:01:12.086 --> 03:01:13.767]  You get to the point where you don't even care.
[03:01:13.767 --> 03:01:15.089]  All that matters is justice.
[03:01:15.589 --> 03:01:25.477]  Red Beckman, finishing up here, because you keep intriguing me, you were pointing out what would happen under the Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports and the double set of books.
[03:01:25.477 --> 03:01:27.839]  The bankers are fabulously wealthy.
[03:01:27.839 --> 03:01:30.281]  They have more wealth than all the nations combined.
[03:01:30.281 --> 03:01:36.846]  If we take their fraudulent wealth, that would fix all of our problems and put dividend bank accounts for everybody.
[03:01:36.846 --> 03:01:40.369]  That's how much wealth they've stolen!
[03:01:40.369 --> 03:01:42.371]  Well, let me say this.
[03:01:42.371 --> 03:01:43.472]  There's very few people
[03:01:44.895 --> 03:01:46.356]  That have understood this.
[03:01:46.356 --> 03:01:59.984]  I explained this to our friend who just passed away back about 20 years ago, and he hadn't really comprehended this.
[03:01:59.984 --> 03:02:06.528]  And he used to have written the book, The Secret of the Federal Reserve, back in the early 50s.
[03:02:06.528 --> 03:02:13.833]  But he hadn't really connected all the dots back in the 80s, after Nixon deregulated gold
[03:02:14.747 --> 03:02:20.610]  Gold mining just blossomed and exploded worldwide.
[03:02:20.610 --> 03:02:23.672]  And where was all that gold going?
[03:02:23.672 --> 03:02:28.894]  It wasn't being bought by Joe Sixpack because he didn't have enough money to buy it.
[03:02:28.894 --> 03:02:32.616]  It was being bought up by the Federal Reserve Bank with those $100 bills.
[03:02:34.355 --> 03:02:36.176]  That they were going to the U.S.
[03:02:36.176 --> 03:02:41.781]  printing press, the printing office, and they were buying $100 bills at that time.
[03:02:41.781 --> 03:02:45.404]  In 1984, I'm thinking of that year in particular.
[03:02:45.404 --> 03:02:50.527]  They were buying $100 bills for 2.6 cents apiece.
[03:02:50.527 --> 03:02:56.992]  How much gold would you have bought if you could have bought $100 bills for 2.6 cents apiece?
[03:02:56.992 --> 03:02:57.753]  Unlimited!
[03:02:57.753 --> 03:03:00.135]  Where is all that gold?
[03:03:01.380 --> 03:03:04.041]  They use it to manipulate and drive down the gold market.
[03:03:04.041 --> 03:03:06.662]  We're going to find out where it's at.
[03:03:06.662 --> 03:03:11.743]  I'm so sure that this is coming.
[03:03:11.743 --> 03:03:21.747]  You know, it's past my time when I can work on it that much, but I'll tell you, there are people out there that are working on this.
[03:03:21.747 --> 03:03:25.528]  Very, very good quality people that are working on this.
[03:03:26.204 --> 03:03:36.006]  And when we find all that gold, and there's thousands of tons of it, and it is going to be ours.
[03:03:36.006 --> 03:03:38.367]  And that's got to worry the system.
[03:03:38.367 --> 03:03:44.568]  That's got to worry the system to know there's all these millions of investigators crawling over everything they're doing.
[03:03:44.568 --> 03:03:48.269]  They're sticking their nose into everything.
[03:03:48.269 --> 03:03:54.570]  And, you know, I can sit on the sidelines now and I'm the cheering section.
[03:03:56.060 --> 03:04:04.366]  And I'll be cheering him on, and so we're going to find out where is all that wealth.
[03:04:04.366 --> 03:04:19.837]  And I think there's enough to just absolutely restore this country back to its position where it belongs as the freest, most free people on the face of the earth.
[03:04:20.336 --> 03:04:21.037]  Absolutely.
[03:04:21.037 --> 03:04:22.818]  Red, we're out of time.
[03:04:22.818 --> 03:04:23.878]  How's your health, my friend?
[03:04:23.878 --> 03:04:24.579]  You sound great.
[03:04:24.579 --> 03:04:33.545]  Well, I'm surviving, and as long as I can keep stimulated as I am, I think I'll be pretty hard to knock down.
[03:04:33.545 --> 03:04:40.609]  So it's not been good, but for 81, I'm doing quite well.
[03:04:40.609 --> 03:04:42.070]  You're still kicking?
[03:04:42.070 --> 03:04:43.511]  You bet.
[03:04:43.511 --> 03:04:44.692]  Let me say bye to you.
[03:04:44.692 --> 03:04:46.353]  I'm going to kick butt after I'm gone.
[03:04:48.916 --> 03:04:49.797]  What a man.
[03:04:49.797 --> 03:04:51.518]  Let me say bye to you during the break.
[03:04:51.518 --> 03:04:52.739]  Mark Dice coming up.
[03:04:52.739 --> 03:04:55.260]  Major coup against the enemy operation.
[03:04:55.260 --> 03:04:55.761]  Stay with us.
[03:05:01.015 --> 03:05:05.578]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:05:05.578 --> 03:05:06.479]  Number one.
[03:05:06.479 --> 03:05:09.902]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:05:09.902 --> 03:05:10.782]  Number two.
[03:05:10.782 --> 03:05:15.666]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:05:15.666 --> 03:05:16.407]  It's true.
[03:05:16.407 --> 03:05:21.270]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:05:21.270 --> 03:05:21.811]  Number three.
[03:05:22.091 --> 03:05:25.674]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:05:25.674 --> 03:05:30.397]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:05:30.397 --> 03:05:33.159]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:05:33.159 --> 03:05:37.622]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:05:37.622 --> 03:05:41.765]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:05:41.765 --> 03:05:46.529]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[03:05:46.829 --> 03:05:50.993]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[03:05:50.993 --> 03:05:52.775]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[03:05:52.775 --> 03:05:55.037]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[03:05:55.037 --> 03:05:57.379]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[03:06:01.462 --> 03:06:04.485]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:06:04.485 --> 03:06:09.810]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:06:09.810 --> 03:06:11.852]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:06:11.852 --> 03:06:16.857]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:06:16.857 --> 03:06:17.778]  How much do you want?
[03:06:18.038 --> 03:06:19.159]  When do you want it?
[03:06:19.159 --> 03:06:21.040]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:06:21.040 --> 03:06:22.121]  When will you need it?
[03:06:22.121 --> 03:06:24.322]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:06:24.322 --> 03:06:25.663]  Will there be any food?
[03:06:25.663 --> 03:06:27.184]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:06:27.184 --> 03:06:32.448]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:06:32.448 --> 03:06:36.030]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:06:36.030 --> 03:06:39.513]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:06:39.853 --> 03:06:41.074]  How much will you need?
[03:06:41.074 --> 03:06:41.975]  We don't know.
[03:06:41.975 --> 03:06:43.097]  How much do you want?
[03:06:43.097 --> 03:06:44.018]  All you can get.
[03:06:44.018 --> 03:06:45.119]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:06:45.119 --> 03:06:48.162]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:06:48.162 --> 03:06:50.405]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:06:50.405 --> 03:06:51.366]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:07:01.207 --> 03:07:03.630]  A revolution in smoking is underway.
[03:07:03.630 --> 03:07:07.475]  A revolution all smokers of traditional cigarettes should know about.
[03:07:07.475 --> 03:07:11.079]  Keep listening for a special offer from PowerVapor.com.
[03:07:11.079 --> 03:07:15.084]  Standard tobacco cigarettes contain over 4,000 harmful chemicals.
[03:07:15.084 --> 03:07:19.189]  Now it's time to release yourself from the grip of big tobacco and experience
[03:07:19.289 --> 03:07:20.870]  It's true smoking freedom.
[03:07:39.939 --> 03:07:40.299]  That's right!
[03:08:02.835 --> 03:08:05.258]  72 hours away, everyone is excited.
[03:08:05.258 --> 03:08:06.720]  Well, almost everyone.
[03:08:06.720 --> 03:08:09.042]  Let's check into the Sports Lodge.
[03:08:09.042 --> 03:08:15.109]  Live from the Jack in the Box studio, it's the Sports Lodge with Roger Lodge.
[03:08:15.109 --> 03:08:19.695]  All right, Roger, I understand you have a very special guest, and somewhat controversial too, huh?
[03:08:19.975 --> 03:08:21.616]  Yeah, this is going to be interesting.
[03:08:21.616 --> 03:08:32.099]  My guest, Mark Dice, has a lot of interesting views on a lot of different things, but this morning we are focusing on one thing and one thing only.
[03:08:32.099 --> 03:08:37.340]  Our guest, Mark Dice, says we should boycott the Super Bowl.
[03:08:37.340 --> 03:08:39.361]  Mr. Dice, good morning, sir.
[03:08:39.361 --> 03:08:43.562]  Good morning, and I would rather have us focus on something other than the Super Bowl, actually.
[03:08:43.562 --> 03:08:46.703]  When we have a society that knows and cares more about
[03:08:47.043 --> 03:08:47.423]  I think?
[03:09:17.343 --> 03:09:31.388]  Let me ask you this, what about the fact that on Sunday I'm going to sit around with my family, my three children, 21, 3 and 5, we're going to sit around, we're going to enjoy a nice meal, and we're going to enjoy a good
[03:09:32.348 --> 03:09:38.390]  Healthy competition between two teams that have worked very hard to get there.
[03:09:38.390 --> 03:09:42.452]  The Saints have a lot to play for here for the city of New Orleans.
[03:09:42.452 --> 03:09:48.454]  What do you say to people like myself who say this is a wonderful opportunity for family time?
[03:09:48.974 --> 03:09:55.759]  I think it's a wonderful opportunity for people to educate their families about the Bilderberg Group, about the certain political issues.
[03:09:55.759 --> 03:10:02.625]  Maybe you should watch a documentary film by Alex Jones, watch Fall of the Republic or The Obama Deception, and get involved.
[03:10:02.625 --> 03:10:11.151]  Instead of yelling and screaming about some people chasing a ball on a grass field, how about we yell and scream about the politicians selling our country out?
[03:10:11.151 --> 03:10:15.775]  Well, Mark, the only yelling I'm going to do is probably at my wife when I need another sandwich.
[03:10:15.775 --> 03:10:16.936]  It's not going to be any yelling.
[03:10:17.296 --> 03:10:18.497]  Let me tell you something.
[03:10:18.497 --> 03:10:30.026]  What about to what this does for the economy and how many millions of dollars this generates with you know just a you know in Miami never mind you know all the people ordering pizzas and doing whatever this is great for the economy.
[03:10:30.026 --> 03:10:32.868]  I don't think it offsets the damage that Obama and his criminal
[03:10:35.470 --> 03:10:37.492]  I don't think that I'm a fan of President Bush.
[03:10:37.492 --> 03:10:39.934]  Bush is a war criminal, should be in prison too.
[03:10:39.934 --> 03:10:40.955]  Wait a second, wait a second.
[03:10:40.955 --> 03:10:42.776]  Let me get back to what we're talking about.
[03:10:42.776 --> 03:10:43.857]  Let me make one more point.
[03:10:43.857 --> 03:10:44.738]  Let me make a point.
[03:10:44.738 --> 03:10:46.159]  Let me ask you this.
[03:10:46.159 --> 03:10:53.746]  When I'm watching a sporting event with my five-year-old and my three-year-old, and on a first down, the Colts get three yards.
[03:10:53.746 --> 03:10:54.907]  You need ten yards
[03:10:55.447 --> 03:11:15.391]  to get a first down and my five-year-old says to me well they got three yards daddy they need seven more yards for a first down there's a little education here involved as well and I don't think there's anything wrong with watching a good healthy athletic event if you use it right with your family I think it's a really good thing Mark
[03:11:15.691 --> 03:11:20.473]  No, I think sports is really the opiate of the masses and contributes to the downfall of the country.
[03:11:20.473 --> 03:11:22.674]  So I urge everybody to boycott the Super Bowl.
[03:11:22.674 --> 03:11:27.255]  Go to MarkDice.com and watch some of my educational videos or the other works and read a book!
[03:11:27.255 --> 03:11:28.396]  Turn the television off!
[03:11:28.396 --> 03:11:29.656]  I disagree, Mr. Dice!
[03:11:29.656 --> 03:11:30.376]  I disagree!
[03:11:35.138 --> 03:11:39.903]  Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed.
[03:11:39.903 --> 03:11:44.508]  Everybody knows the war is over.
[03:11:44.508 --> 03:11:49.173]  Everybody knows the good guys lost.
[03:11:49.173 --> 03:11:51.155]  Everybody knows the fight was won.
[03:11:52.176 --> 03:11:54.037]  You know, we didn't plan that bumper music.
[03:11:54.037 --> 03:11:56.557]  Everybody knows that Dice is loaded.
[03:11:56.557 --> 03:11:59.058]  We've got Mark Dice on the line with us.
[03:11:59.058 --> 03:12:06.681]  Again, Mark Dice goes out, he puts a YouTube video up saying the Super Bowl is over, the Super Bowl is off.
[03:12:06.681 --> 03:12:08.401]  Everybody goes and flocks to it.
[03:12:08.401 --> 03:12:11.242]  Super Bowl is cancelled, I believe is the actual name of the video.
[03:12:11.242 --> 03:12:13.403]  Going from memory here, Mark can correct me.
[03:12:13.843 --> 03:12:16.184]  And then he gets on KLA TV.
[03:12:16.184 --> 03:12:23.187]  I mean, we're talking about guaranteed hundreds of thousands watching KLA radio, hundreds of thousands listening.
[03:12:23.187 --> 03:12:24.867]  It goes viral on the web.
[03:12:24.867 --> 03:12:31.790]  Millions of people start thinking, wait, why am I only caring about sports as the country falls apart?
[03:12:31.790 --> 03:12:35.652]  Sure, if we had George Washington for president and we weren't
[03:12:36.452 --> 03:12:46.959]  You know, 14 plus trillion dollars in debt just from last year alone, and we didn't have, the new jobless numbers were 400,000, now they've adjusted them to 800 plus thousand.
[03:12:46.959 --> 03:12:50.742]  That's Bloomberg, a link up on Infowars.com right now.
[03:12:50.742 --> 03:13:05.272]  I mean, sure, if everything was fine, it'd be okay to only care about a football game, but this is our new god that we've given our freedom up for, and I tell you Mark, they started panicking when you started bringing up real issues.
[03:13:05.652 --> 03:13:18.077]  They didn't know what they were getting into when they had me on, because I think they just anticipated somebody was going to just talk about how important we should read some history, and I don't think that they knew exactly what they were getting into.
[03:13:18.077 --> 03:13:21.499]  And you could hear them cut me off as soon as I started criticizing Obama.
[03:13:21.499 --> 03:13:23.360]  But you continue to game them.
[03:13:23.360 --> 03:13:28.142]  I mean, how many stunts like this have you pulled, every one of them with more and more devastating effect?
[03:13:28.891 --> 03:13:29.952]  Oh, just one after the other.
[03:13:29.952 --> 03:13:33.774]  I mean, you string them all together and it seems like it's this incredible success.
[03:13:33.774 --> 03:13:37.315]  Sometimes it's few and far between that I'll have something hit this big.
[03:13:37.315 --> 03:13:38.696]  But just look at what this does.
[03:13:38.696 --> 03:13:43.859]  I mean, this can reach... There were half a billion, hundreds of thousands of people.
[03:13:43.859 --> 03:13:46.500]  There's millions of people in Los Angeles.
[03:13:46.500 --> 03:13:49.962]  And now you've got more media calling you, so it's a snowball.
[03:13:50.322 --> 03:13:57.085]  Yeah, this was also my clip, my video rant was shown on a Denver CBS affiliate.
[03:13:57.085 --> 03:14:03.148]  I posted that on YouTube, they filed a copyright infringement claim and emailed me and they've all pulled all copies of that video.
[03:14:03.148 --> 03:14:07.170]  But it's getting out, they wanted people to link to their copies streaming from their website.
[03:14:08.150 --> 03:14:08.870]  It's getting out.
[03:14:08.870 --> 03:14:13.032]  And I also want to just urge everybody, you know, in the next few days, the Super Bowl is going to be the hot topic.
[03:14:13.032 --> 03:14:20.914]  So if you're going to get sucked into that, try to use this as an angle to really make people think about what it is that they're focusing on.
[03:14:20.914 --> 03:14:21.074]  I agree.
[03:14:21.074 --> 03:14:23.375]  In fact, Mark, I'm going to talk about your video.
[03:14:23.835 --> 03:14:29.124]  And do one tonight that I'm going to have go mega-viral, pointing out that America's dying.
[03:14:29.124 --> 03:14:31.547]  Why do you only care about this football game?
[03:14:31.547 --> 03:14:38.719]  And some people won't listen now, but a couple years later when things are even worse, they're going to remember and start getting their head screwed on straight.
[03:14:39.141 --> 03:14:47.448]  Well, I think a lot of the people are going to maybe feel this sort of peer pressure that they have to sort of be interested and involved in the Super Bowl and the festivities this weekend.
[03:14:47.448 --> 03:15:00.218]  And so I think we can provide an environment for them to feel safe in resisting that and giving them some ammunition that they can... Or how about sending people to Super Bowl parties with Obama Deception, Fall of the Republic, or your new book?
[03:15:01.691 --> 03:15:11.224]  You know, and if you're going to have to watch the game, why don't you bring the DVDs and then afterwards, when everybody's nice and, you know, lit up, you can just have them watch Fall of the Republic or The Obama Deception.
[03:15:11.224 --> 03:15:13.087]  You've got a captive audience right there.
[03:15:13.087 --> 03:15:16.291]  Hey, you're like, come on baby, come back to the apartment and watch Obama Deception.
[03:15:17.446 --> 03:15:20.008]  It's very conducive.
[03:15:20.008 --> 03:15:20.968]  And this is how it's done.
[03:15:20.968 --> 03:15:27.672]  I got some footage from a post later of me, kind of behind the scenes, until a producer came up and told me I can't videotape there.
[03:15:27.672 --> 03:15:36.478]  But I'm just going to show, break the illusion that most people think that Los Angeles and Hollywood LA is just this beautiful Disneyland.
[03:15:36.478 --> 03:15:39.639]  But I got footage of behind the scenes of this television studio.
[03:15:39.639 --> 03:15:41.080]  It's really nothing.
[03:15:41.080 --> 03:15:43.662]  But the green room is the area where people go and sit
[03:15:44.122 --> 03:15:47.364]  People know this where you sit and kind of wait before you're a guest on a show.
[03:15:47.364 --> 03:15:53.728]  And I would imagine that most people think that a green room at a Los Angeles television station is going to be this luxurious area.
[03:15:53.728 --> 03:15:57.030]  But just wait until you see the video footage that I post of the green room.
[03:15:57.030 --> 03:16:01.273]  Just to shatter this illusion of this multi-million dollar propaganda machine.
[03:16:02.981 --> 03:16:15.209]  Well, Mark, you continue to kick butt hundreds and hundreds of thousands of views with your video of the majority of people in San Diego saying, ban free speech, arrest anybody that disagrees with Obama.
[03:16:15.209 --> 03:16:19.892]  Cass Sunstein, his regulations czar, is writing white papers on it.
[03:16:19.892 --> 03:16:26.056]  And now they're openly announcing that Google is spying on everybody for the NSA in the name of keeping us safe.
[03:16:26.576 --> 03:16:39.782]  And we've got all these governments from Italy to Australia putting net censorship in that dwarfs even China, and we've got Time Magazine calling for an internet ID to even be able to get online worse than China.
[03:16:39.782 --> 03:16:45.204]  Yeah, and this is not news to us, but now it's front page on the Drudge Report that the NSA is working with Google.
[03:16:45.204 --> 03:16:52.968]  So, I mean, once again, everything that we've been saying... That's right, I had that CIA guy steal on, what, five years ago, about how Google's really a CIA front.
[03:16:54.241 --> 03:16:57.863]  Well, and again, just gives more credibility to you, to others.
[03:16:57.863 --> 03:17:00.685]  And so, you know, I just want to stress again, let's choose Super Bowl.
[03:17:00.685 --> 03:17:04.588]  So many people are going to be going out and buying new TVs today and tomorrow and Saturday.
[03:17:04.588 --> 03:17:10.432]  So why don't we maybe pick it outside of some electronic stores and just really use this as an opportunity to
[03:17:11.249 --> 03:17:17.656]  Truth Jam, as I call it, the culture jam to use the system, you know, against itself.
[03:17:17.656 --> 03:17:23.582]  Because imagine no one's ever gone out front of a sports bar and protested that it's a gladiatorial diversion.
[03:17:23.582 --> 03:17:29.729]  One of 2,000 years ago, people would have gone and protested in front of the Roman Coliseum saying, this is a distraction.
[03:17:29.729 --> 03:17:32.832]  This is where you're trained to dehumanize your fellow humans.
[03:17:33.352 --> 03:17:36.673]  Where your neighbor's being killed one week, you're being killed the next week.
[03:17:36.673 --> 03:17:41.695]  This is where you're dehumanized, where you're taught to enjoy seeing your fellow man torn down.
[03:17:41.695 --> 03:17:52.078]  This is a false religion, an idol from real issues and real tribal energies of warfare that are meant to stand up for your family.
[03:17:52.078 --> 03:17:55.359]  How about protesting the biggest sports bars?
[03:17:55.359 --> 03:18:00.061]  Not even protesting them, just being there, pointing out to folks a real war is going on.
[03:18:01.129 --> 03:18:07.192]  Yeah, you know, when people bring a megaphone into a sports bar, just be careful, you know, you're gonna have a lot of angry, drunk football fans.
[03:18:07.192 --> 03:18:11.654]  But it is a sad state of affairs when these football stars are held up as heroes.
[03:18:11.654 --> 03:18:16.256]  You know, it's like they saved a bunch of children from a burning building, you know, the day after the Super Bowl.
[03:18:16.256 --> 03:18:17.397]  Yeah, crackhead, drug addict.
[03:18:17.397 --> 03:18:19.278]  In fact, here's one.
[03:18:19.278 --> 03:18:26.461]  National Labor Committee, women paid 10 cents to sew $80 Peyton Manning jerseys for NFL and Reebok.
[03:18:27.381 --> 03:18:34.688]  You know, since when are our colors not George Washington, Declaration of Independence, and semi-automatic rifles?
[03:18:34.688 --> 03:18:41.154]  Since when did the jersey of an American not be freedom and liberty and Ron Paul in 1776?
[03:18:41.154 --> 03:18:52.325]  Since when did it become a bunch of addled, brain-damaged, drug addict, steroid head, with pimples all over their faces and backs, wallowing around with crack whores?
[03:18:52.990 --> 03:18:59.685]  It's very sad, and again, I understand some people can be football fans, but it just really shows the state of America.
[03:19:00.131 --> 03:19:09.257]  I think when people are more interested in that, just imagine what we could do if we got 60,000 people instead of going to a stadium, if we were to surround the White House on one weekend.
[03:19:09.257 --> 03:19:09.617]  Exactly!
[03:19:09.617 --> 03:19:10.078]  No, no, no.
[03:19:10.078 --> 03:19:20.945]  That's why the UN and others say, and even back in Roman times they wrote, they give you these sports stadiums and hype up sports so you'll be distracted under their tyranny.
[03:19:20.945 --> 03:19:26.209]  And again, I see friends, family catching their breath watching football.
[03:19:27.119 --> 03:19:30.442]  We need that same excitement for liberty.
[03:19:30.442 --> 03:19:31.803]  That's what's so sick.
[03:19:31.803 --> 03:19:34.565]  They're scientifically using it, Mark.
[03:19:34.565 --> 03:19:35.506]  Yep, well, we're doing it.
[03:19:35.506 --> 03:19:38.709]  We're changing minds, you know, one mind at a time, so everybody get out there.
[03:19:38.709 --> 03:19:47.596]  It's another opportunity to bring these issues to the forefront of power to the resistance and shattering the multi-million dollar propaganda machines.
[03:19:47.596 --> 03:19:52.300]  Well, Mark, I appreciate the plugs for the Obama Deception Fall the Republic on the show as well.
[03:19:52.300 --> 03:19:52.600]  Stay there.
[03:19:52.600 --> 03:19:55.343]  I want to talk a little bit more before our next guest comes up.
[03:19:56.704 --> 03:19:59.446]  Well, I guess troops dying at DU and Agent Orange isn't a big deal.
[03:19:59.446 --> 03:20:01.967]  We only care about Peyton Manning.
[03:20:01.967 --> 03:20:02.647]  Attention.

[03:22:02.472 --> 03:22:06.498]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:22:06.498 --> 03:22:09.762]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:22:09.762 --> 03:22:14.549]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:22:14.549 --> 03:22:18.415]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress.
[03:22:19.033 --> 03:22:20.914]  And they really are calling the shots.
[03:22:20.914 --> 03:22:26.477]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us, as American citizens, to pay attention.
[03:22:26.477 --> 03:22:29.459]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[03:22:29.459 --> 03:22:36.223]  A criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:22:36.223 --> 03:22:38.584]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:22:38.584 --> 03:22:40.185]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:22:40.185 --> 03:22:42.627]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:22:42.627 --> 03:22:44.468]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:22:44.468 --> 03:22:46.289]  And right now in Washington, D.C.,
[03:22:46.989 --> 03:22:49.892]  We have seen a fall of the Republic.

[03:23:18.217 --> 03:23:18.697]  We're good to go.
[03:23:45.800 --> 03:23:51.368]  If you have more than $25,000 in credit card debt, student loans, or difficult mortgage situation, we can help.
[03:23:51.368 --> 03:23:55.113]  And we are the only organization to provide written guarantees on the results.
[03:23:55.113 --> 03:23:59.739]  Go to ZeroDebtGuaranteed.com That's ZeroDebtGuaranteed.com
[03:24:12.284 --> 03:24:15.187]  The Super Bowl has been cancelled is the name of his video.
[03:24:15.187 --> 03:24:19.792]  It was going towards number one on YouTube until they started manipulating it and they clearly do that.
[03:24:19.792 --> 03:24:20.813]  It doesn't matter.
[03:24:20.813 --> 03:24:28.720]  I meant to cut some Monday or so when we posted it on InfoWars and time got away from me because it's a great idea but I imitate a lot of what Mark does.
[03:24:29.361 --> 03:24:30.641]  He certainly learned some from me.
[03:24:30.641 --> 03:24:32.182]  That's what we all do together.
[03:24:32.182 --> 03:24:41.444]  And so I'm going to make several videos tonight that we need to go mega viral because you'll get football heads who aren't even thinking about this information to actually question.
[03:24:41.444 --> 03:24:43.325]  Hey, you're losing your job.
[03:24:43.325 --> 03:24:45.265]  The CPS is trying to take your kids.
[03:24:45.265 --> 03:24:46.786]  Society's falling apart.
[03:24:46.786 --> 03:24:51.227]  Do you know the history of mega stadium sports?
[03:24:51.787 --> 03:25:02.940]  Sports itself are a great thing for young people, but when it becomes these big mega spectacles, it's just like gambling or the lottery or anything.
[03:25:02.940 --> 03:25:04.201]  It's a sick joke.
[03:25:04.201 --> 03:25:06.444]  Mark Dice, we've got about four minutes left with you, my friend.
[03:25:06.444 --> 03:25:07.164]  I appreciate you.
[03:25:07.805 --> 03:25:09.166]  Well, because it's just, it's true.
[03:25:09.166 --> 03:25:10.067]  I mean, it's sad when Americans
[03:25:33.035 --> 03:25:45.197]  Care more about worthless issues like that, and it's such, it's not even that okay, I understand people can have their entertainment, but it's such an obsession, and that the football game, especially the Super Bowl, is built up to such a level.
[03:25:45.197 --> 03:25:54.579]  And then also, too, I knew that the media was going to grab this story and run with it, because since everybody loves the Super Bowl, I mean, what kind of a person would boycott the Super Bowl?
[03:25:54.579 --> 03:25:57.960]  That's an interesting story, and so that's the story that I fed.
[03:25:58.795 --> 03:26:07.660]  To the Los Angeles station, and they grabbed it and ran with it, and it is an interesting story, but I don't think... And you're using their propaganda against them.
[03:26:07.660 --> 03:26:16.586]  You're reaching sports zombies, who are literally zombies, don't even know what planet they're on, through their own brainwashing, you're waking them up to real issues.
[03:26:16.586 --> 03:26:26.572]  Look, I know how the media works, and if I want to be a scumbag, I could be one of them, but instead I want to use their system against the system, and so that's kind of the artwork that I've sort of
[03:26:27.182 --> 03:26:32.448]  I've been able to do is I can weasel my way into the mainstream media occasionally.
[03:26:32.981 --> 03:26:39.223]  Through a back door, with an issue that will then, I will tie into something that's more important.
[03:26:39.223 --> 03:26:41.384]  So this is just an incredible success.
[03:26:41.384 --> 03:26:45.026]  But as soon as you brought up real issues, they cut you off.
[03:26:45.026 --> 03:26:46.586]  Oh, they didn't want to hear about it.
[03:26:46.586 --> 03:26:51.648]  And you could hear Roger Lodge at the beginning, it was, we're only going to focus on one thing.
[03:26:51.648 --> 03:26:56.330]  And I think they just thought I was going to talk about how it would be nice to learn some American history.
[03:26:56.330 --> 03:27:00.832]  People don't read enough, but I don't think they knew what they were getting into when they had me on.
[03:27:01.132 --> 03:27:04.374]  I don't know if they'll have me back again ever.
[03:27:04.374 --> 03:27:09.318]  Yeah, but there's a lot of other big media outlets that you can infiltrate.
[03:27:09.318 --> 03:27:12.240]  And again, other people can do similar things to what you're doing.
[03:27:12.240 --> 03:27:18.124]  It may not be on national TV or big Los Angeles TV, but I mean, look at the Joker poster contest.
[03:27:18.124 --> 03:27:18.824]  We're getting ready.
[03:27:18.824 --> 03:27:19.505]  I know I'm behind.
[03:27:19.505 --> 03:27:23.408]  I've just been so busy to launch the naked body scanner contest.
[03:27:24.028 --> 03:27:32.234]  I mean, that was literally on hundreds of TV stations, hundreds of newspapers, Japan, Germany, England, the U.S., Argentina, L.A.
[03:27:32.234 --> 03:27:43.962]  TV, Chicago TV, Austin TV, Dallas TV, little TV stations, big TV stations, all because listeners went out and put up Obama posters saying fascist or socialist.
[03:27:44.602 --> 03:27:46.124]  Pick your poison, we had both.
[03:27:46.124 --> 03:27:47.825]  I mean, it's command and control.
[03:27:47.825 --> 03:27:50.068]  And they would freak out and say, ban it, ban it!
[03:27:50.068 --> 03:27:54.912]  So people would put more up, and they finally just shut up, but that was devastating.
[03:27:54.912 --> 03:27:59.197]  And we can pull these stunts on the enemy all day, and teach other people how to do it.
[03:27:59.707 --> 03:28:03.988]  Well, that's why your audience and the movement is really just growing bigger and bigger.
[03:28:03.988 --> 03:28:14.410]  There's certain key times when it just wakes people up, and I'm sure that there's going to be so many people now that are thinking, wait a minute, why do I really care and get all excited about this?
[03:28:14.410 --> 03:28:18.671]  And I kind of feel like I'm a fish out of water sometimes.
[03:28:18.671 --> 03:28:24.932]  I had dinner with some friends and friends of friends the other day, and the first thing that these people asked me when I sat down is, Colter St.!
[03:28:24.932 --> 03:28:27.533]  And I just couldn't take it, you know?
[03:28:28.956 --> 03:28:33.478]  I mean, people at gas stations, people on the street, cults are saints.
[03:28:33.478 --> 03:28:36.198]  We don't talk about how do we get together and defeat this corrupt government.
[03:28:36.198 --> 03:28:37.579]  How do we get our country back?
[03:28:37.579 --> 03:28:38.859]  How do we save our jobs?
[03:28:38.859 --> 03:28:41.840]  How do we get our education system fixed?
[03:28:41.840 --> 03:28:44.681]  No, it's like, cults are saints, cults are saints.
[03:28:44.681 --> 03:28:47.362]  This is at the heart of what's wrong with our country.
[03:28:47.362 --> 03:28:51.384]  America isn't about worshipping a bunch of crackheads.
[03:28:51.384 --> 03:28:54.004]  It isn't about worshipping a bunch of roid heads.
[03:28:54.004 --> 03:28:57.266]  It isn't about a bunch of steroid heads being worshipped.
[03:28:57.266 --> 03:28:58.346]  It's about freedom.
[03:28:59.148 --> 03:29:08.451]  Once you start to become aware of these ideas, as you know, as I'm sure much of the audience knows, you just, your eyes start to open and you completely start to see things for what they are.
[03:29:08.451 --> 03:29:11.132]  You are unplugged from the matrix.
[03:29:11.132 --> 03:29:12.713]  It's like living in another world.
[03:29:12.713 --> 03:29:14.213]  Colts are saints.
[03:29:14.213 --> 03:29:15.274]  Colts are saints.
[03:29:15.274 --> 03:29:16.094]  Polly got a cracker.
[03:29:17.039 --> 03:29:23.382]  But you're so much better by knowing and not being a sheep and not following the herd over a cliff.
[03:29:23.382 --> 03:29:36.068]  You know, sometimes knowing some of the information that we know is a little stressful, but it's better to know it and be able to identify it and not be a manipulated leaf in the wind or just a sheep in the herd.
[03:29:36.068 --> 03:29:37.488]  Mark Dice, we're out of time.
[03:29:37.488 --> 03:29:38.789]  You were an inspiration to us all.

[03:29:46.980 --> 03:29:51.745]  See ya.
[03:29:51.745 --> 03:29:53.147]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.147 --> 03:29:55.670]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.670 --> 03:29:58.373]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.069 --> 03:30:05.171]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[03:30:05.171 --> 03:30:08.033]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[03:30:08.033 --> 03:30:10.134]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[03:30:10.134 --> 03:30:12.376]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[03:30:12.376 --> 03:30:14.036]  And it's available right now to you.

[03:31:02.875 --> 03:31:06.896]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:31:06.896 --> 03:31:10.137]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:31:10.137 --> 03:31:11.537]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:31:12.262 --> 03:31:15.683]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:31:15.683 --> 03:31:21.325]  Tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:31:21.325 --> 03:31:26.507]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:31:26.507 --> 03:31:36.490]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:31:36.610 --> 03:31:38.952]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:31:38.952 --> 03:31:40.553]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:31:40.553 --> 03:31:43.015]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:31:43.015 --> 03:31:45.137]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[03:31:45.137 --> 03:31:50.281]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:31:50.281 --> 03:31:59.408]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:32:01.420 --> 03:32:02.201]  Hi, everyone.
[03:32:02.201 --> 03:32:03.262]  Andy Anderson here.
[03:32:03.262 --> 03:32:07.688]  Are you using those little bottles of hand gel that kill germs, bacteria, and other nasties?
[03:32:07.688 --> 03:32:13.475]  In today's world, that's smart, especially with the filthy doorknobs, shopping carts, and handrails we touch every day.
[03:32:13.475 --> 03:32:17.820]  Did you know that once the alcohol evaporates in a few seconds, good-bye effectiveness?
[03:32:17.820 --> 03:32:19.522]  No more protection till you use it again.
[03:32:19.662 --> 03:32:21.004]  Pure Works to the rescue!
[03:32:21.004 --> 03:32:25.408]  Our FDA-compliant foam, lotion, soap, and spray do not contain alcohol.
[03:32:25.408 --> 03:32:27.611]  Their killing power lasts up to four hours.
[03:32:27.611 --> 03:32:40.565]  Pure Works disinfecting spray is EPA-certified to kill swine flu, bird flu, MRSA, HIV, hepatitis B and C, and for our friends in medicine, kills C. diff, along with a whole host of viruses and bacteria, molds and fungus, too.
[03:32:40.745 --> 03:32:41.846]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:33:10.930 --> 03:33:13.112]  We had Red Beckman on, Patriot icon for more than two hours.
[03:33:13.112 --> 03:33:16.774]  He'll definitely want to stay with us for that retransmission.
[03:33:16.774 --> 03:33:19.216]  Look, I know that most people know that Agent Orange is deadly.
[03:33:36.857 --> 03:33:46.987]  But it's now been declassified, and I have one of those recently declassified secret documents, Department of Veterans Affairs.
[03:33:46.987 --> 03:33:48.428]  This is Admiral E.R.
[03:33:48.428 --> 03:33:49.349]  Zumwalt, Jr.
[03:33:49.349 --> 03:33:52.993]  I'd seen this, but it was brought back to my attention, and the fact that
[03:33:53.922 --> 03:34:01.026]  Monsanto, the folks that bring us all the GMO food that have natural pesticides in it so the bugs can't eat it, then we eat it.
[03:34:01.026 --> 03:34:06.950]  The studies show it kills the rats, has organ failure, and we're eating this.
[03:34:06.950 --> 03:34:09.291]  They know that this is happening.
[03:34:09.291 --> 03:34:10.792]  Why are they doing it?
[03:34:10.792 --> 03:34:15.936]  And you go back to Agent Orange, you know, I had some family, great, loving, wonderful family.
[03:34:16.716 --> 03:34:30.265]  Vietnam veteran helicopter pilot, no history of any child deformities on either side of the family, and they had their wonderful firstborn son, clearly from Agent Orange, all the classic things.
[03:34:30.265 --> 03:34:32.947]  He died when he was a few years old.
[03:34:32.947 --> 03:34:40.672]  And you look at the numbers of doubling, tripling, quadrupling, and even more in southern Serbia, in Kosovo, in
[03:34:42.857 --> 03:34:43.318]  I think?
[03:34:59.557 --> 03:35:02.620]  A toxic waste, certain forms of toxic waste.
[03:35:02.620 --> 03:35:03.180]  You don't believe me?
[03:35:03.180 --> 03:35:06.623]  Just fact guys, Google aspartame manufacturing process.
[03:35:06.623 --> 03:35:08.524]  You'll be on university sites.
[03:35:08.524 --> 03:35:15.630]  And so a genetically engineered bacteria defecates and then that's the toxic poison you drink that tastes so sweet.
[03:35:15.630 --> 03:35:20.394]  Kind of like another great example is, you know, your cat or dog will drink antifreeze.
[03:35:20.394 --> 03:35:21.074]  It's very sweet.
[03:35:21.920 --> 03:35:22.320]  I think so.
[03:35:42.130 --> 03:35:55.822]  They've now got their SmartStack corn, it's gonna be the biggest crop planted this year, replacing all their other main crops of corn, that has six pesticides in it, and two other traits, eight genetic traits total.
[03:35:55.822 --> 03:36:06.972]  But we go back to Agent Orange, they knew day one this was dioxin, they knew day one, and I have the report here, that it was massively more toxic than arsenic.
[03:36:08.063 --> 03:36:10.505]  In fact, I highlighted one copy of the report.
[03:36:10.505 --> 03:36:11.426]  Is this the one we highlighted?
[03:36:11.426 --> 03:36:14.248]  Because I wanted to go over some of those areas.
[03:36:14.248 --> 03:36:17.471]  And this is what the Army knew all along.
[03:36:17.471 --> 03:36:20.914]  But they won't even give the vets the treatment they need.
[03:36:20.914 --> 03:36:25.778]  What does this tell you about the mindset of the elite that we have?
[03:36:25.778 --> 03:36:28.200]  What does this tell you about their mindset?
[03:36:28.200 --> 03:36:30.242]  I mean, this tells you everything you need to know.
[03:36:30.242 --> 03:36:32.364]  Linda K. May is an RN.
[03:36:32.364 --> 03:36:33.945]  She's worked with Dr. Doug Rockey.
[03:36:33.945 --> 03:36:35.366]  She came highly recommended from him.
[03:36:36.960 --> 03:36:39.300]  And she is an expert on toxic chemicals.
[03:36:39.300 --> 03:36:43.081]  She's worked in... I tried to go over all the things she's done.
[03:36:43.081 --> 03:36:56.264]  State of Illinois Hazardous Materials Advisory Board Certification, Fire Marshal, Site Manager, Hazardous Materials Site Manager, Department of Veterans Affairs, Hospitals, Safety, Fire Protection, University of Illinois Department of Family Medicine, St.
[03:36:56.264 --> 03:37:01.485]  Louis University School of Medicine, Multidisciplinary Certificate in Geriatrics.
[03:37:01.485 --> 03:37:02.085]  It goes on.
[03:37:02.705 --> 03:37:02.945]  Thank you.
[03:37:20.719 --> 03:37:28.281]  I just kind of recapped some of the things with Monsanto, but specifically with Agent Orange, there's been some new articles in the Chicago Tribune.
[03:37:28.281 --> 03:37:30.882]  Agent Orange, lethal legacy for U.S.
[03:37:30.882 --> 03:37:32.422]  A record of neglect.
[03:37:32.422 --> 03:37:33.762]  I mean, it's more than that.
[03:37:33.762 --> 03:37:36.843]  Poisonous defoliants still exact toll in U.S.
[03:37:36.843 --> 03:37:38.423]  and Vietnam.
[03:37:38.423 --> 03:37:40.304]  Break down your research into Agent Orange.
[03:37:40.304 --> 03:37:46.185]  I have a number of years of research in toxic chemicals and their health effects.
[03:37:47.054 --> 03:37:53.036]  The last four years I've been doing research not only in black mold but Agent Orange.
[03:37:53.036 --> 03:37:59.097]  Agent Orange has a biomarker which can be tested for in a urine sample.
[03:37:59.097 --> 03:38:02.298]  The most important thing that would be of note is the U.S.
[03:38:02.298 --> 03:38:11.481]  Army Medical Research at Fort Dedrick, Maryland, as well as the CDC, all agree you cannot test for this toxin in any blood sample.
[03:38:11.481 --> 03:38:14.201]  You can only test for it in urine.
[03:38:14.201 --> 03:38:16.222]  And that's done through DNA-PCR.
[03:38:17.023 --> 03:38:21.868]  Um, the research has shown that it's been there for a lot of years.
[03:38:21.868 --> 03:38:29.374]  Basically, we all know if you go before a judge, you're caught driving under the influence or using drugs.
[03:38:29.374 --> 03:38:31.276]  The judge will say, I want a urine sample.
[03:38:31.276 --> 03:38:34.839]  It's unequivocal court proof.
[03:38:34.839 --> 03:38:41.125]  Um, the test exists and has existed and is available now publicly where you can literally pee in a jar.
[03:38:42.023 --> 03:38:48.665]  And prove that not only do you have the toxin in your body, but you can measure the quantity of that toxin in it.
[03:38:48.665 --> 03:38:57.047]  And there are 101 different research articles done by Fort Detrick, Maryland, specifically attached to Chapter 34.
[03:38:57.047 --> 03:39:00.988]  And in that chapter, all of the research was done on U.S.
[03:39:00.988 --> 03:39:02.308]  military subjects.
[03:39:02.888 --> 03:39:08.051]  As you know, when you're in the military, basically, you know, if they ask you to give a sample, you don't have a choice.
[03:39:08.051 --> 03:39:09.272]  You give a sample.
[03:39:09.272 --> 03:39:18.478]  But a lot of times they weren't told why, but they may have served in an area where the toxin was present, and based on this research, they were able to determine that.
[03:39:18.478 --> 03:39:26.283]  What's important is the Department of Veterans Affairs was given a report by Admiral Grumwald Sr.
[03:39:26.283 --> 03:39:31.686]  regarding the issue of Agent Orange, and he was requested to do so, I believe at White House request,
[03:39:32.412 --> 03:39:40.815]  And that report was not released from declassification until a few years ago, but the problem was it was never published in the United States.
[03:39:40.815 --> 03:39:55.980]  It's been available in Canada, but nowhere in the United States was it found available, and that's how you came to it was I gave it to Doug and asked if anyone had ever seen it, and everyone was appalled because it was not published in the U.S.
[03:39:58.675 --> 03:40:02.460]  And reading this report, they know how deadly this is.
[03:40:02.460 --> 03:40:07.987]  I mean, describe what Agent Orange really is, and Agent Blue, and what it does.
[03:40:07.987 --> 03:40:09.649]  Okay.
[03:40:09.649 --> 03:40:13.934]  Well, most people don't know, and those of us who do, who work with chemicals and
[03:40:15.487 --> 03:40:21.912]  All the other substances that are harmful, is Agent Orange basically had an orange stripe on the barrel.
[03:40:21.912 --> 03:40:32.080]  Back in the late 60s and 70s, when a chemical was found to be really, really hazardous, the rule was you had to put it in a barrel and pay to bury it somewhere for a thousand years.
[03:40:32.080 --> 03:40:33.060]  What the U.S.
[03:40:33.060 --> 03:40:37.584]  government did, and the chemical companies liked, was the U.S.
[03:40:37.584 --> 03:40:42.828]  government said, okay, we'll make half of each barrel dioxin, call it Agent Orange,
[03:40:43.484 --> 03:40:43.884]  I don't know.
[03:41:01.127 --> 03:41:11.358]  So each barrel had not only a herbicide, a pesticide, a dioxin, they added the neurotoxin to give it a biomarker so that we knew it was our chemical.
[03:41:11.358 --> 03:41:11.919]  And then the U.S.
[03:41:11.919 --> 03:41:21.489]  Department of Defense said, we'll pay you Dow and all these other chemicals, and we'll get rid of your chemicals for you instead of you having to pay to bury it in the U.S.
[03:41:21.809 --> 03:41:23.190]  Now, let's expand on that.
[03:41:23.190 --> 03:41:30.174]  They put a neurotoxin in that attacks animals and people's brains, knowing what they were doing.
[03:41:30.174 --> 03:41:32.735]  I mean, this is all done on purpose.
[03:41:32.735 --> 03:41:36.037]  Well, I have explained it publicly.
[03:41:36.037 --> 03:41:37.978]  There was a neurotoxin in there.
[03:41:37.978 --> 03:41:44.061]  Neurotoxins, as you know, are put in pesticides, herbicides, and others to kill rodents.
[03:41:44.061 --> 03:41:46.463]  They put enough quantity in there.
[03:41:46.463 --> 03:41:48.924]  It wasn't just little four-legged, two-ounce rodents.
[03:41:49.560 --> 03:41:53.924]  This was big rodents, two-legged, several hundred pounds.
[03:41:53.924 --> 03:42:00.751]  Yeah, well, bottom line, ma'am, have you seen the White House Science Czar's own book where he says, basically, kill us like rodents?
[03:42:00.751 --> 03:42:02.853]  I mean, this is not being done by accident.
[03:42:02.853 --> 03:42:09.740]  You know, they tell the guys it's a herbicide, a defoliant, and really they're putting, you know, neurotoxin.
[03:42:09.740 --> 03:42:11.562]  I mean, for those that don't know, that's what a cobra has.
[03:42:13.243 --> 03:42:16.906]  Well I thought it was even more as they didn't tell the truth.
[03:42:16.906 --> 03:42:31.316]  The truth about what they had and in this report it identifies that it was not diluted and it was used off the books by those people in the brown water navy and the blue water navy at full strength.
[03:42:43.693 --> 03:42:58.202]  And then in other things, and Admiral Zumwalt says that he knew it and authorized to use, and that it wasn't recorded, but that those men would be given the same medical care whether or not they had proof of it being used, because they had guaranteed that.
[03:42:58.202 --> 03:42:59.963]  Now, can you talk about Zumwalt?
[03:42:59.963 --> 03:43:06.427]  Because I know there's about to be a bunch of big media coming out on this, and I don't want to hurt that in any way.
[03:43:06.427 --> 03:43:09.329]  I mean, you've been doing deep investigation.
[03:43:09.329 --> 03:43:11.810]  I mean, how much can you tell us about Zumwalt?
[03:43:11.810 --> 03:43:13.071]  Because you just don't have the document.
[03:43:14.700 --> 03:43:23.804]  Uh, what I can say about this is, I've done my research and literature, but I do know and have met the family.
[03:43:23.804 --> 03:43:26.425]  They are grateful that the truth is coming out.
[03:43:26.425 --> 03:43:31.747]  As you know, Admiral Zumwalt's son served in the Navy and died of Agent Orange.
[03:43:31.747 --> 03:43:34.308]  And Admiral Zumwalt Sr.
[03:43:34.308 --> 03:43:43.091]  wrote this document knowing the truth about it, wanting the truth to be out there, but was told that it was classified and that he could not speak.
[03:43:43.951 --> 03:43:53.671]  I do know that the family has suffered with the loss of family members due to the exposure, as everyone is probably aware there are Native families.
[03:43:54.508 --> 03:43:58.951]  Everyone in his family did serve in combat areas at one time or another.
[03:43:58.951 --> 03:44:01.573]  And they have suffered the revenge of Agent Orange.
[03:44:01.573 --> 03:44:03.155]  Well, this has hurt my family.
[03:44:03.155 --> 03:44:06.557]  This has hurt my family as well and probably most families listening.
[03:44:06.557 --> 03:44:09.139]  But again, people only care about the Super Bowl.
[03:44:09.139 --> 03:44:13.522]  They'll get mad if the Colts lose or if the Saints lose.
[03:44:13.522 --> 03:44:15.084]  This is the mental illness.
[03:44:15.084 --> 03:44:23.110]  Everyone I know has had somebody hurt or killed or deformed children from this garbage who was in Vietnam while it was being used.
[03:44:23.790 --> 03:44:24.811]  Well, I can't answer that.
[03:44:24.811 --> 03:44:29.757]  I know that, you know, the chemical safety laws weren't put into effect until the 70s.
[03:44:44.389 --> 03:44:55.111]  But it is very apparent that Admiral Zumwalt was aware of it and he regretted signing the order to use it as a pesticide herbicide and it cut deeply personally for him.
[03:44:55.111 --> 03:45:11.455]  I can say in one section, you know, just to verify it says, a major source of exposure for ground sources were from non-recorded uses by Groundwater and Bluewater Navy in addition to the flyovers by Ranch Hand.
[03:45:12.651 --> 03:45:21.624]  This document is quite broad and specific and basically gives people benefits they've thought for 30 to 40 years.
[03:45:21.624 --> 03:45:23.867]  Linda, you're not on a speakerphone, are you?
[03:45:23.867 --> 03:45:24.268]  No, I'm not.
[03:45:24.821 --> 03:45:25.942]  Yeah, it's just a little bit echoey.
[03:45:25.942 --> 03:45:27.443]  Try to get a little bit closer to the receiver for me.
[03:45:27.443 --> 03:45:35.828]  You know, I'm definitely going to have to have you back up in the near future, because you've got so much knowledge, so much research, and come so highly recommended by Dr. Doug Rockey.
[03:45:35.828 --> 03:45:54.481]  I mean, we have the scandal of this happening, and similar things being used today, and DU and all of this, but I guess the larger issue is, according to the research I've done, but correct me if I'm wrong, they're still trying to deny treatment, deny payments to families dealing with Agent Orange.
[03:45:55.310 --> 03:45:58.451]  Yes, they are.
[03:45:58.451 --> 03:46:08.475]  And this document very clearly shows where there was a deliberate attempt to ensure that people were denied coverage from the exposure.
[03:46:08.475 --> 03:46:11.356]  That's the important point of the document, is this document
[03:46:12.122 --> 03:46:20.627]  Clears up that issue and makes it very clear that all those backlogged people waiting for benefits should be granted those benefits immediately.
[03:46:20.627 --> 03:46:24.729]  Do you know why they put the human nerve killer, the neurotoxin, in it?
[03:46:24.729 --> 03:46:27.651]  I mean, they say it was a marker so they would know it was theirs?
[03:46:27.651 --> 03:46:29.452]  I mean, what does that mean?
[03:46:29.452 --> 03:46:33.394]  And you said it rates, you know, meant to kill humans.
[03:46:33.394 --> 03:46:35.775]  I mean, you know, killing 200 pound rats.
[03:46:35.775 --> 03:46:36.035]  Right.
[03:46:37.628 --> 03:46:46.714]  In other words, with different countries involved in a war, you want to biomark your substance to know it's your poison versus somebody else's.
[03:46:46.714 --> 03:46:48.896]  It's like a marker on a bullet.
[03:46:48.896 --> 03:47:02.766]  And so this particular thing was put in there, I suspect, with the term of being a marker because they had identified it as a marker in 1943 when it was found at the University of Chicago.
[03:47:03.647 --> 03:47:16.417]  But, they put larger quantities in knowing that it would become a nerve toxin and would go straight to the larger animals and rodents versus the smaller animals.
[03:47:16.417 --> 03:47:20.801]  And knowing our troops, knowing our troops were going to ingest it.
[03:47:20.801 --> 03:47:22.722]  Correct.
[03:47:22.722 --> 03:47:32.570]  So, for whatever reason, McNamara and then others after him knew our troops were getting hit with super weapons grade neurotoxin on top of the dioxin.
[03:47:33.513 --> 03:47:35.274]  Yes.
[03:47:35.274 --> 03:47:40.916]  Very nice people.
[03:47:40.916 --> 03:47:47.178]  From your research into this, what are the effects of the neurotoxin, the dioxin, and the other chemicals?
[03:47:47.178 --> 03:47:58.963]  What it essentially does in those exposed is the toxin embeds itself inside the cellular DNA and at that level it is passed on in body fluid and sperm
[03:47:59.761 --> 03:48:10.724]  So that when husbands and wives go home, they pass it on to their unborn children, and those defects are passed on to other great-grandchildren, etc.
[03:48:10.724 --> 03:48:15.286]  So you basically, it's a take-home poison to the greater population.
[03:48:15.286 --> 03:48:22.748]  And it wrecks DNA, and most of the time you end up having a miscarriage instead of a deformed baby, so it's also a sterilant.
[03:48:22.748 --> 03:48:25.229]  I'm not specifically
[03:48:26.209 --> 03:48:31.612]  Saying that, what I'm saying is it embeds itself in the cellular DNA and wreaks havoc from that point on.
[03:48:31.612 --> 03:48:33.213]  And they admit that in this report.
[03:48:33.213 --> 03:48:36.074]  I mean, reading this report, this is from the military.
[03:48:36.074 --> 03:48:37.115]  Yes, it is.
[03:48:37.115 --> 03:48:44.979]  It's admitted, and it's admitted that not only does it kill your children, it kills your grandchildren and any other member of your family that comes in contact with it.
[03:48:47.628 --> 03:48:57.542]  Because it breaks up the DNA, which, and I've seen major studies, in fact, Google this, human DNA mutating faster.
[03:48:57.542 --> 03:49:01.688]  And it's scientists baffled at human DNA suddenly mutating.
[03:49:01.688 --> 03:49:03.410]  My God, these people are out of control.
[03:49:05.168 --> 03:49:24.234]  Well, it's been known for a number of years, and it was identified in government reports, as in this one, to the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and it would give people benefits that they'd earned in the military, knowing that they would be quite ill and probably would die within a few years from their exposures.
[03:49:27.472 --> 03:49:29.193]  Well, I've been studying Monsanto.
[03:49:29.193 --> 03:49:35.715]  It turns out they knew in the 50s and 60s that this dioxin-based stuff was deadly, and they were burying it all over the country.
[03:49:35.715 --> 03:49:42.197]  So, why do you think Monsanto and other chemical companies don't care?
[03:49:42.197 --> 03:49:48.819]  One of the paragraphs is very important to the document, and it's on my page 35.
[03:49:48.819 --> 03:49:55.701]  It says, strangely, the deception, fraud, and political interference is characterized, government-sponsored,
[03:49:57.084 --> 03:50:10.712]  Basically, I don't think Admiral Dunwalt was giving all the facts when he ordered this to be used to kill the weeds and the fauna that were, you know, hiding people that were shooting at them.
[03:50:10.712 --> 03:50:16.596]  I don't think he knew it didn't become available to people until after it was being used over there.
[03:50:16.596 --> 03:50:23.480]  So, I mean, the government, he had the facts, and the drug company and the chemical companies also helped him do that.
[03:50:24.718 --> 03:50:36.446]  Yeah, I'm reading here from the Admiral's own secret report here about the shameful deception, fraud, and political interference that has characterized government-sponsored studies on the health.
[03:50:36.446 --> 03:50:40.009]  We're going to come back and talk about what we can do to try to
[03:50:41.334 --> 03:50:43.797]  Help people and de-use.
[03:50:43.797 --> 03:50:50.646]  Got a 40-something million year total half-life till it... And they're using that all over the place.
[03:50:50.646 --> 03:50:53.810]  Pretty soon they might put it in the water and say it's like fluoride, good for your teeth.
[03:50:53.810 --> 03:50:56.012]  I mean, there's no end to what these people will do.
[03:50:56.012 --> 03:50:58.936]  They might say shooting yourself in the head is good, you know?
[03:50:58.936 --> 03:51:00.158]  We'll be right back with our guest.
[03:51:02.102 --> 03:51:02.682]  We're good to go.
[03:51:17.213 --> 03:51:17.754]  I think so.
[03:51:36.573 --> 03:51:37.014]  I think so.
[03:52:03.107 --> 03:52:07.130]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:52:07.130 --> 03:52:10.372]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:52:10.372 --> 03:52:11.773]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[03:52:12.501 --> 03:52:15.182]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:52:15.182 --> 03:52:21.563]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:52:21.563 --> 03:52:26.744]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:52:26.744 --> 03:52:36.726]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:52:36.846 --> 03:52:39.188]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:52:39.188 --> 03:52:40.790]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:52:40.790 --> 03:52:43.252]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:52:43.252 --> 03:52:45.374]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:52:45.374 --> 03:52:50.519]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[03:54:10.676 --> 03:54:16.880]  Our guest is Linda K. May, RN, in-depth researcher working with Dr. Doug Rocky and others for 30 years.
[03:54:16.880 --> 03:54:20.563]  We know that Iraq is now suing the U.S.
[03:54:20.563 --> 03:54:21.644]  for using DU.
[03:54:21.644 --> 03:54:25.027]  It's confirmed it's causing mass deformities, illnesses, and deaths.
[03:54:25.027 --> 03:54:26.147]  What about Vietnam?
[03:54:26.147 --> 03:54:28.329]  What about communities in the U.S.
[03:54:28.329 --> 03:54:31.672]  that have this Agent Orange and other dioxin all over the place?
[03:54:31.672 --> 03:54:35.795]  I mean, from reading the reports, the health effects are still continuing.
[03:54:38.203 --> 03:54:39.904]  Yes, there are.
[03:54:39.904 --> 03:54:59.697]  As you know, the toxin stays in the water and the food for 700 years, and Admiral Dunwall talked about the fact that migration of the toxin into the river channels and the food chain of Vietnam, and that's why they have such a large problem with birth defects and pregnancy and other issues.
[03:54:59.697 --> 03:55:02.579]  The water there is still contaminated with the toxin.
[03:55:06.039 --> 03:55:11.061]  And these companies and the military have just gotten away with it.
[03:55:11.061 --> 03:55:17.243]  I understand that the courts have ruled that the statute of limitations is out of order.
[03:55:17.243 --> 03:55:20.404]  So if you knowingly poison people, there's a statute of limitations?
[03:55:20.404 --> 03:55:22.405]  I thought there's no statute of limitations on murder.
[03:55:25.517 --> 03:55:28.259]  Again, that's an issue I haven't delved into.
[03:55:28.259 --> 03:55:30.941]  I'm just well aware of what is going on in the country.
[03:55:30.941 --> 03:55:31.202]  No, no.
[03:55:31.202 --> 03:55:32.463]  I mean, I know you're right about that.
[03:55:32.463 --> 03:55:36.326]  I mean, I know you're right about them saying, hey, you know, no big deal.
[03:55:36.326 --> 03:55:40.949]  But you've also researched other chemicals and things that are being used currently.
[03:55:40.949 --> 03:55:41.990]  Yes, I have.
[03:55:41.990 --> 03:55:44.232]  And the same issue is true there, too.
[03:55:44.232 --> 03:55:50.877]  They do stay around for thousands of years, and they affect the population to come unborn.
[03:55:50.877 --> 03:55:51.057]  Yes.
[03:55:51.584 --> 03:55:55.627]  But they're telling us carbon dioxide is what has to be regulated and stopped.
[03:55:55.627 --> 03:55:56.508]  Plants breathe it.
[03:55:56.508 --> 03:56:04.695]  But, hey, Agent Orange, DU, 40 billion year, you know, until it's not radioactive, what is it, 45 billion years?
[03:56:04.695 --> 03:56:07.337]  700 years for Agent Orange, A-OK.
[03:56:07.337 --> 03:56:08.338]  But you know what?
[03:56:08.338 --> 03:56:12.101]  We've got to put a tax on your can of beans or on a beefsteak.
[03:56:12.101 --> 03:56:14.142]  I mean, this is a big, sick joke.
[03:56:14.142 --> 03:56:15.704]  What are the websites we can visit?
[03:56:16.164 --> 03:56:16.924]  What can we do?
[03:56:16.924 --> 03:56:24.928]  I know there's a lot of media coming out on this now, thanks to your work and others, but what else can we do to expose this and fight this?
[03:56:24.928 --> 03:56:31.811]  What I ask your people to do is to put up this article on your website and make it available.
[03:56:31.811 --> 03:56:43.296]  And then I would ask them to ensure that they let others know that they are entitled to benefits and then, you know, let your congressman know that the documents do exist out there and that it's time to act.
[03:56:44.185 --> 03:56:50.896]  And not use toxins to affect, you know, our great-grandchildren should they be born later on.
[03:56:51.513 --> 03:56:57.154]  Well, that's the thing about conservative veterans and people who've had their children deformed or have cancer.
[03:56:57.154 --> 03:56:59.175]  The VA tells them, oh, you don't get any benefits.
[03:56:59.175 --> 03:57:01.015]  No, under law, you're supposed to.
[03:57:01.015 --> 03:57:08.857]  We are going to post this Department of Veterans Affairs now declassified secret document, and we're also going to put a link up to the Chicago Tribune's latest on this.
[03:57:08.857 --> 03:57:12.797]  I know more is coming out, but we'll leave it at that for now.
[03:57:12.797 --> 03:57:17.518]  Thank you so much for the great work that you're doing, Linda May.
[03:57:17.518 --> 03:57:18.879]  God bless you.
[03:57:18.879 --> 03:57:19.979]  Thank you.
[03:57:19.979 --> 03:57:20.399]  Take care.
[03:57:21.912 --> 03:57:30.445]  You know, I've been trying to go back into issues like Aspartame, Agent Orange, DU, so that you can then understand that this is an agenda.
[03:57:31.718 --> 03:57:33.699]  Just like the genetically modified crops.
[03:57:33.699 --> 03:57:39.763]  They know it's killing you and causing organ failure and leukemia in all their studies.
[03:57:39.763 --> 03:57:42.985]  And they are pushing it and pushing it hard.
[03:57:42.985 --> 03:57:44.526]  Most other countries have banned it.
[03:57:44.526 --> 03:57:45.366]  The U.S.
[03:57:45.366 --> 03:57:48.068]  pushes it for the school lunch programs, everything.
[03:57:48.068 --> 03:57:50.009]  This is eugenics.
[03:57:50.009 --> 03:57:53.871]  This is the orderly extermination of our population.
[03:57:53.871 --> 03:57:57.313]  Adding a deadly neurotoxin to eat your brain
[03:57:58.334 --> 03:57:58.775]  We're good to go.
[03:58:17.614 --> 03:58:22.398]  Red Beckman coming up in the retransmission on the Infowars.com restreams right now.

[03:58:30.544 --> 03:58:36.989]  We can expose the globalist crimes, we'll bring them to justice, and that's starting to happen, but we got a long way to go, but we are getting traction.
[03:58:36.989 --> 03:58:37.830]  Great job, crew.
[03:58:37.830 --> 03:58:43.254]  See you back live tomorrow, 11 a.m.

[03:58:51.279 --> 03:58:55.821]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:58:55.821 --> 03:59:00.163]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:59:00.163 --> 03:59:05.906]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:59:05.906 --> 03:59:11.208]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:59:11.508 --> 03:59:12.349]  Number 3.
[03:59:12.349 --> 03:59:15.932]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:59:15.932 --> 03:59:19.856]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:59:19.856 --> 03:59:20.636]  Number 4.
[03:59:20.636 --> 03:59:23.399]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:59:23.399 --> 03:59:27.082]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:59:27.082 --> 03:59:27.883]  Number 5.
[03:59:27.883 --> 03:59:32.027]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:59:32.027 --> 03:59:36.791]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[03:59:37.071 --> 03:59:41.234]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
