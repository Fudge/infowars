[00:00.000 --> 00:26.000]  The
[00:26.000 --> 00:27.000]  year is 2020.
[00:27.000 --> 00:34.000]  We are watching a foreign multinational communist-Chinese takeover of the United States take place.
[00:34.000 --> 00:42.000]  And we are here in the really sacred hollows of one of the most important and historical monuments in the United States,
[00:42.000 --> 00:44.000]  the Lincoln Memorial.
[00:44.000 --> 00:47.000]  Now, why is the Lincoln Memorial so incredibly important?
[00:47.000 --> 00:49.000]  Because it was.
[00:49.000 --> 00:56.000]  Back at that time, in the 1860s, the powerful multinational forces tried to split the United States up.
[00:56.000 --> 00:58.000]  Now, some would call Lincoln a tyrant.
[00:58.000 --> 01:00.000]  Others would call him a hero.
[01:00.000 --> 01:05.000]  But it's a fact that he was fighting against multinational forces, the British, namely,
[01:05.000 --> 01:10.000]  who had already attempted to break this country up in the war of 1812 and later against Andrew Jackson.
[01:10.000 --> 01:17.000]  That's why I'm starting this broadcast today from D.C. to bring into context the historic moment we're in.
[01:17.000 --> 01:20.000]  The country is fighting for its life.
[01:20.000 --> 01:23.000]  And anyone that denies that is lying to you.
[01:23.000 --> 01:26.000]  Joe Biden is not a legitimate president.
[01:26.000 --> 01:27.000]  He's not a legitimate president-elect.
[01:27.000 --> 01:31.000]  Even if Joe Biden had won this election for his square, which he hasn't, the fraud's overwhelming,
[01:31.000 --> 01:33.000]  he is a communist-Chinese agent.
[01:33.000 --> 01:40.000]  Where there was no evidence of Trump with the Russians, there is total evidence of Joe Biden and the communist-Chinese and the Russians.
[01:40.000 --> 01:46.000]  If Donald Trump had done 1% of what Joe Biden has done with foreign powers to sell off the interests of this country,
[01:46.000 --> 01:48.000]  I would say that Donald Trump should be in prison.
[01:48.000 --> 01:51.000]  But Donald Trump has done absolutely none of it.
[01:51.000 --> 02:03.000]  That's why we stand here and use this as a very powerful illustration of the fact that our country is not on the verge of a civil war.
[02:03.000 --> 02:05.000]  It is in the midst of a civil war.
[02:05.000 --> 02:09.000]  And the factions against America and against Trump are globalist.
[02:09.000 --> 02:13.000]  So this is not like the Southerners who had some arguments, but were probably in the wrong in many ways.
[02:13.000 --> 02:24.000]  This is communist-Chinese-backed, this revolution against America, with 3 million innocent Muslims in death camps, a million Christians, and a million Buddhists.
[02:24.000 --> 02:30.000]  And that is the entire leftist model of the entire planet with the castle of society, the social credit score, and all the rest of it.
[02:30.000 --> 02:37.000]  So I'm going to give you a little bit of a tour around D.C. in the first few segments and break the latest news and huge developments and play some clips
[02:37.000 --> 02:42.000]  of the big speeches that happened here yesterday in the second million-manga march that was very successful.
[02:42.000 --> 02:44.000]  And then, Harrison Smith is going to be taking over.
[02:44.000 --> 02:50.000]  But again, I want to encourage you all on this live Sunday transmission to realize history is happening now.
[02:50.000 --> 02:54.000]  And if you acquiesce to this takeover, you have absolutely no future.
[02:54.000 --> 02:58.000]  This isn't like past elections. This isn't like past crises this country faced.
[02:58.000 --> 03:04.000]  It's a greater threat than what we had in the Civil War, because at least the southern and northern cultures came out of the same country.
[03:04.000 --> 03:07.000]  And we're brothers, and we're sisters, and we're fathers and mothers.
[03:07.000 --> 03:13.000]  And it was brother against brother sometimes. But it was two cultures that were very similar who had major disagreements.
[03:13.000 --> 03:21.000]  With the globalist takeover and the globalist model, it is outside multinational forces that are doing this and trying to destroy our country.
[03:21.000 --> 03:25.000]  And so that's why we're here pointing this out.
[03:25.000 --> 03:32.000]  That's why we're here trying to give people to realize that we are in the midst of a foreign multinational takeover of our country.
[03:32.000 --> 03:34.000]  So we're going to go to break. We're going to come back with a live feed.
[03:34.000 --> 03:39.000]  And a lot more today, please tell your friends and family to tune in to this Sunday transmission, because history is happening right now.
[03:39.000 --> 03:42.000]  And if we ring the alarm bells, as modern Paul reveres, we can reverse this.
[03:42.000 --> 03:50.000]  If we don't, there is no hope. So again, we're live on Sunday. Thank you for tuning in. We'll be right back on the other side.
[03:50.000 --> 04:15.000]  A lot of patriots in here.
[04:15.000 --> 04:27.000]  Our forebears did not have separation of church and state as they spin it. It means the state has no jurisdiction over any of us.
[04:27.000 --> 04:32.000]  Our relationship with God is sacred and is eternal.
[04:32.000 --> 04:36.000]  So no, whatever happens, we will never give up. We will never surrender.
[04:36.000 --> 04:50.000]  We will never back down to the Satanic pedophile globalist New World Order and their walking dead, reanimated corpse Joe Biden.
[04:50.000 --> 05:01.000]  And we will never recognize him.
[05:01.000 --> 05:06.000]  Just in time for Christmas, a lot of our best selling products are back in stock.
[05:06.000 --> 05:11.000]  The privacy pockets are back in stock and massively discounted in 1995.
[05:11.000 --> 05:16.000]  A great stock and stuff for a great gift. Alpha Power sold out for a year because of the lockdown.
[05:16.000 --> 05:20.000]  A lot of the key patent ingredients weren't available. It is now back in stock.
[05:20.000 --> 05:25.000]  Another great product that's been selling out because people realize it's got so many great vitamins and minerals.
[05:25.000 --> 05:31.000]  It's good for women's clans as well.
[05:31.000 --> 05:35.000]  Check it out. They're all massively discounted at infowarstore.com.
[05:35.000 --> 05:39.000]  And of course, some of the big ones are X2 and X3, the pure clean iodines that are so essential.
[05:39.000 --> 05:43.000]  So many people are deficient in iodine. It's essential to your immune system.
[05:43.000 --> 05:52.000]  And so much more, infowarstore.com. All of these products are discounted from 30 to 60% off in free shipping.
[05:52.000 --> 05:55.000]  Your orders in by the 18th. You'll get them before Christmas.
[05:55.000 --> 06:23.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[06:23.000 --> 06:35.000]  Live from the infowar.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[06:35.000 --> 06:40.000]  Thank you for joining us on this Sunday edition. It is the 13th of December, 2020.
[06:40.000 --> 06:48.000]  We're 40 days out from the inauguration. Isn't it interesting that we have Joe Biden saying he's not going to be at the inauguration
[06:48.000 --> 06:54.000]  at the classic place that you do it in front of the Capitol, just a mile or so down the road from here,
[06:54.000 --> 07:01.000]  that he's going to do a virtual event, but they're building the inauguration stage there, regardless,
[07:01.000 --> 07:06.000]  because the election is not over yet.
[07:06.000 --> 07:13.000]  And we have to understand something, even as I've said 100 times, even if Joe Biden actually won this election, which he didn't,
[07:13.000 --> 07:18.000]  he has to be opposed because he is a communist Chinese agent on record.
[07:18.000 --> 07:25.000]  And we, the people up front, need to continue to defend Trump and defend our election rights and not let our rights be stolen from us.
[07:25.000 --> 07:36.000]  But the bigger issue is the fact that Joe Biden is a globalist that said that communist China should run every facet of our lives.
[07:36.000 --> 07:44.000]  If we continue, come on over here. Get on there with us. Come on. Oh, you got one. Is that your IQ?
[07:44.000 --> 07:47.000]  That's your big IQ?
[07:47.000 --> 07:54.000]  Hey, we're not anti-filial like you that are anti-free speech. You're on air, smart man. Come on over here.
[07:54.000 --> 08:00.000]  Oh, wear your little panty mask on. No, no, no. Oh, I'm coming after you. You're the one around your mouth.
[08:00.000 --> 08:07.000]  You're the one with a little panty diaper over your face. Yeah, you wear your little slave diaper over your face there, buddy.
[08:07.000 --> 08:16.000]  Huh? Come on over. Get interviewed by a big man. Or is that all you got? Your one finger IQ, huh?
[08:16.000 --> 08:23.000]  Okay, so a lot of great fans out here. USA. USA. USA.
[08:23.000 --> 08:33.000]  So we're out here unscripted folks. No teleprompter. Let's just go to this now. Let's go to my speech at the Jericho event that was amazing.
[08:33.000 --> 08:38.000]  Tens of thousands there. Owen Schroyer also spoke. Let's go to some highlights of those speeches.
[08:38.000 --> 08:44.000]  They're going to come back and I'll get into the chai comms and the globalists the next leg of the fight and what America's facing if Joe Biden gets in
[08:44.000 --> 08:49.000]  or Trump's very limited path to overturning this fraud that really lies in our hands.
[08:49.000 --> 08:53.000]  So here are those two pieces of information and we'll be right back on this time.
[08:53.000 --> 09:04.000]  Folks, in the spirit of unity, I'd like to bring out my new friend, Alex Jones, is it? I think his name is Alex Jones.
[09:04.000 --> 09:25.000]  Yeah. Praise God. America is awakening. Humanity is awakening. And Jesus Christ is king.
[09:25.000 --> 09:36.000]  Not David Rockefeller, not Bill Gates, not Barack Obama, not Joe Biden, but Jesus Christ is king.
[09:36.000 --> 09:42.000]  And God gave us and rose up Donald Trump to stand against the enemy and draw out the enemy.
[09:42.000 --> 09:52.000]  So as dark as some of these days are, understand this is the beginning of the great revival before the Antichrist comes.
[09:52.000 --> 10:02.000]  World government, implantable microchips, Satanism, it's out of the open. The Bible is fulfilled. Revelation is fulfilled.
[10:02.000 --> 10:12.000]  Jesus Christ is fulfilled. God Almighty is in charge and we follow that mighty God.
[10:12.000 --> 10:21.000]  You look at the miserable globalists. You look at people like Bill Gates and you look at people like Mark Zuckerberg and the rest of them.
[10:21.000 --> 10:34.000]  They are miserable slaves of Satan and we pray for them and hope that the Holy Spirit can still touch their soul.
[10:34.000 --> 10:47.000]  But more importantly, we pray for President Donald John Trump in this incredibly serious moment.
[10:47.000 --> 10:59.000]  And we pray for all the women in America who the system is trying to lie to to kill their babies and we say, don't kill your babies.
[10:59.000 --> 11:16.000]  The enemy has been forced out in the open. World government is here and the system is publicly stealing this election from the biggest landslide and the biggest political realignment since 1776.
[11:16.000 --> 11:35.000]  Our God is the God of the universe. Our God is the God of strength and honor and will and God is in control and God is on our side.
[11:35.000 --> 11:46.000]  So we praise God and we thank God and we know that it's all in God's plan and the Lord works in mysterious ways.
[11:46.000 --> 11:54.000]  Christ's crucifixion was not our defeat. It was our greatest victory.
[11:54.000 --> 12:02.000]  When he rose again on the third day, he broke the change of hell and death.
[12:02.000 --> 12:15.000]  We have the deed to this planet. We have the deed to eternal life and we praise Jesus Christ and the Father.
[12:15.000 --> 12:30.000]  The enemy wants to keep the whorehouses open and the liquor stores open and the Walmart's open and the targets and the Amazons while they tell you the churches are not essential.
[12:30.000 --> 12:39.000]  Congress shall make no law establishing the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[12:39.000 --> 12:46.000]  Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion or the free exercise thereof.
[12:46.000 --> 12:52.000]  Meaning our forebears did not have separation of church and state as they spin it.
[12:52.000 --> 13:04.000]  It means the state has no jurisdiction over any of us. Our relationship with God is sacred and is eternal.
[13:04.000 --> 13:09.000]  So no, whatever happens, we will never give up. We will never surrender.
[13:09.000 --> 13:23.000]  We will never back down to the satanic, pedophile, globalist, new world order and their walking dead, reanimated corpse Joe Biden.
[13:23.000 --> 13:34.000]  And we will never recognize him. President Trump had zero connection to Russians, no proof, four years of investigation.
[13:34.000 --> 13:42.000]  He had to hide to see it's open and shut. So I don't know who's going to the White House in 38 days, but I sure know this.
[13:42.000 --> 13:53.000]  Joe Biden is a globalist and Joe Biden will be removed one way or another.
[13:53.000 --> 13:59.000]  Our great first president, we literally are here on his farm, that's where we're at.
[13:59.000 --> 14:06.000]  George Washington didn't want to be king and had me serve two terms and set that precedent, he left.
[14:06.000 --> 14:10.000]  He was a very quiet man and didn't talk about his beliefs, but he was a Christian.
[14:10.000 --> 14:15.000]  But those that knew him privately knew. He knew God controlled battlefields.
[14:15.000 --> 14:18.000]  God controlled governments. God controls the games.
[14:18.000 --> 14:28.000]  And all his success was because of his love of God and being in line with God.
[14:28.000 --> 14:34.000]  So never forget, we worship the true God that created the universe and all of us.
[14:34.000 --> 14:41.000]  And the satanic globalists trying to take control of us and trying to play God are fallen and are failed.
[14:41.000 --> 14:48.000]  And we need to just keep our eyes on Christ and never back down and never surrender.
[14:48.000 --> 14:52.000]  At four o'clock today, we're going to march back to the Supreme Court.
[14:52.000 --> 14:58.000]  He got some other great folks at Freedom Plaza, if some of you aren't here later, go get them, leave them to Supreme Court at four,
[14:58.000 --> 15:03.000]  at this great event, but pray for America, pray for the world, pray for Trump,
[15:03.000 --> 15:07.000]  and realize you're not going to get instant gratification, but with Trump it's as close as it got.
[15:07.000 --> 15:13.000]  Look how far we've come. Look at what we've been able to do, and this is just the beginning.
[15:13.000 --> 15:18.000]  I'm going to turn this over to my buddy for two minutes, my great co-host at infoawards.com.
[15:18.000 --> 15:24.000]  I'll destroy her. And then the next great, the next great guests are coming up here.
[15:24.000 --> 15:30.000]  But remember this, God ordained this republic to stand against the satanic empires,
[15:30.000 --> 15:33.000]  the Nazis and the communists and others.
[15:33.000 --> 15:42.000]  And so 1776 is God's number of victory over the satanic 1984.
[15:42.000 --> 15:54.000]  God bless you all, and I salute you. Thank you, Jesus.
[15:54.000 --> 16:19.000]  What do we feel about Alex Jones, ladies and gentlemen?
[16:19.000 --> 16:24.000]  Let Alpha Power's incredible ingredients can help you boost your sports performance

[16:51.000 --> 16:59.000]  Head to infoawardsstore.com today.
[16:59.000 --> 17:04.000]  The project for world government developed by the British Empire via Cecil Rhodes,
[17:04.000 --> 17:09.000]  then picked up by the Rockefeller family and the major robber barons the planet by the 1920s,
[17:09.000 --> 17:11.000]  is all about corporate global governance.
[17:11.000 --> 17:13.000]  And now you're seeing it.
[17:13.000 --> 17:17.000]  The blue states, the blue cities, the communist and socialist nations all working in unison
[17:17.000 --> 17:21.000]  under UN control established a medical planetary dictatorship.
[17:21.000 --> 17:29.000]  At the core of it is the Fortune 100 corporations themselves funded by a handful of private central banking families,
[17:29.000 --> 17:34.000]  the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, the Dutch and British royalty being at the very heart of that.
[17:34.000 --> 17:38.000]  Then you learn the Dutch and British royalty aren't even Dutch or British at the same time.
[17:38.000 --> 17:45.000]  But they go back to the literal count Dracula and the wars in between Christendom and Islam.
[17:45.000 --> 17:49.000]  Those that don't know history really are doomed to repeat it.
[17:49.000 --> 17:51.000]  They're involved in poting the world economy.
[17:51.000 --> 17:54.000]  That's what the social distancing the masks are all about.
[17:54.000 --> 17:58.000]  It's about bankrupting local small businesses and those that comply are complying with your own destruction.
[17:58.000 --> 18:00.000]  Wake up.
[18:00.000 --> 18:05.000]  I've got some really exciting good news and I've also got some bad news.
[18:05.000 --> 18:12.000]  M4 Wars is getting the highest traffic we have ever gotten since the election in 2016.
[18:12.000 --> 18:16.000]  Despite all the bans, all of the system trying to censor us and suppress us,
[18:16.000 --> 18:22.000]  you with your word of mouth have overwritten that and they are so scared of m4wars.com and Bandod video.
[18:22.000 --> 18:25.000]  And they're so scared of you being able to communicate and share the truth.
[18:25.000 --> 18:30.000]  But we're bringing in the same amount of money we brought in last December right now.
[18:30.000 --> 18:33.000]  This is our most important month to fund ourselves in the next year.
[18:33.000 --> 18:35.000]  And I understand the economy shut down.
[18:35.000 --> 18:37.000]  I understand there's not as much money as there used to be.
[18:37.000 --> 18:38.000]  They're trying to kill Trump's recovery.
[18:38.000 --> 18:40.000]  But m4wars really need your support.
[18:40.000 --> 18:46.000]  You just buy great items through your Christmas shopping at m4wars.com with huge sales, amazing products.
[18:46.000 --> 18:50.000]  And then you know you're funding the m4wars and not funding Amazon and Jeff Bezos
[18:50.000 --> 18:53.000]  and the globalists that are openly trying to destroy small businesses.
[18:53.000 --> 18:59.000]  Continue to fund the Second American Revolution while getting great products at the same time at m4wars.com. Thank you.
[18:59.000 --> 19:04.000]  Three months ago we sold out of our privacy pouches.
[19:04.000 --> 19:08.000]  The reason we sold out is they are super high quality and it's all over the news
[19:08.000 --> 19:13.000]  that the UN and the Clintons and Microsoft and others of contact tracers
[19:13.000 --> 19:15.000]  are tracking everywhere you go and everything you do.
[19:15.000 --> 19:20.000]  They admit it's a cover for bringing in their cashless society, AI system of total control.
[19:20.000 --> 19:23.000]  So to block the UN, to block the globalists, to get in the habit of realizing
[19:23.000 --> 19:27.000]  what a surveillance system phones are, everybody needs a privacy pocket
[19:27.000 --> 19:31.000]  and they've fed almost all sizes of droids and iPhones from small to big.
[19:31.000 --> 19:35.000]  They also make a great gift to educate friends and family about what's going on.
[19:35.000 --> 19:38.000]  Now again, there's lots of privacy pocket type systems out there.
[19:38.000 --> 19:40.000]  Most of them are about 90% effective.
[19:40.000 --> 19:46.000]  We found a model that's actually pretty inexpensive and has around 99% effectiveness.
[19:46.000 --> 19:49.000]  If you're right under a cell tower, it'll still blast through the fair day occasion.
[19:49.000 --> 19:51.000]  They're at m4wars.com at $19.95.
[19:51.000 --> 19:54.000]  This exact same system is sold everywhere else for $29.
[19:54.000 --> 19:56.000]  It's still a great deal.
[19:56.000 --> 19:58.000]  We sell a lot of these and we have the best prize.
[19:58.000 --> 20:27.000]  Christmas gift at m4wars.com.
[20:28.000 --> 20:51.000]  That's the...
[20:51.000 --> 20:55.000]  And you just heard some of the speech I gave at the Jericho Group.
[20:55.000 --> 20:58.000]  It was great being invited out there where those folks really enjoyed it.
[20:58.000 --> 21:01.000]  And this is a fight between good and evil.
[21:01.000 --> 21:03.000]  But during our shooting for this Sunday transmission,
[21:03.000 --> 21:06.000]  the live part of it's coming up with Harrison Smith here in about 15 minutes,
[21:06.000 --> 21:08.000]  a guy came over and started saying,
[21:08.000 --> 21:10.000]  F-U, F-U, F-U.
[21:10.000 --> 21:13.000]  So we said, hey, come on over here and talk to us.
[21:13.000 --> 21:14.000]  Come on here.
[21:14.000 --> 21:17.000]  Don't show us your one point IQ when they flip us off.
[21:17.000 --> 21:19.000]  And he said, oh, you're intimidating me.
[21:19.000 --> 21:20.000]  You're threatening me.
[21:20.000 --> 21:21.000]  You're a bully.
[21:21.000 --> 21:24.000]  So it's anti for that beats people up, shuts down people's speech.
[21:24.000 --> 21:28.000]  It's anti for and the Democrats and big tech that are censoring everybody.
[21:28.000 --> 21:31.000]  They're the ones taking people's bank accounts that are nationalist or patriots or pro-Trump.
[21:31.000 --> 21:33.000]  They're the ones brainwashing our children.
[21:33.000 --> 21:35.000]  They're the ones fighting authoritarian regimes.
[21:35.000 --> 21:37.000]  They're the ones that are engaged in all this.
[21:37.000 --> 21:40.000]  But then when they see us out here and say F-U,
[21:40.000 --> 21:42.000]  we say, come on over, be on camera.
[21:42.000 --> 21:43.000]  Tell us how we're bad.
[21:43.000 --> 21:45.000]  Oh, no, you're threatening me.
[21:45.000 --> 21:47.000]  Oh, you want to attack me.
[21:47.000 --> 21:48.000]  It's crazy.
[21:48.000 --> 21:53.000]  Here we are at one of the very historic and also very haunting memorials.
[21:53.000 --> 21:59.000]  This is the Korean War or Korean conflict memorial where a lot of people died.
[21:59.000 --> 22:05.000]  And again, that was fighting the communist Chinese who were oppressing and taking control of the North Koreans.
[22:05.000 --> 22:07.000]  And we see that fight ongoing today.
[22:07.000 --> 22:11.000]  And we see President Trump trying to get a successful peace deal with North Korea.
[22:11.000 --> 22:16.000]  We see President Trump getting all of these huge peace deals and treaties
[22:16.000 --> 22:20.000]  between what eight different nations in the Middle East that nobody else could do.
[22:20.000 --> 22:27.000]  But now he's the bad guy and the average leftist says that Trump is a fascist dictator and a bad person like Hitler,
[22:27.000 --> 22:31.000]  even though Trump's the one trying to end all these wars,
[22:31.000 --> 22:35.000]  like we've seen on the Korean Peninsula and like we're seeing in the Middle East,
[22:35.000 --> 22:38.000]  Trump's trying to be a peacemaker and the left is against them.
[22:38.000 --> 22:40.000]  Just like the left's anti-free speech,
[22:40.000 --> 22:45.000]  then they turn around and say that we're anti-free speech by even talking back to them.
[22:45.000 --> 22:52.000]  That's how the left operates because they're communist and you've got big major corporations that are allied with the communists
[22:52.000 --> 22:53.000]  because they don't want free market.
[22:53.000 --> 22:56.000]  They don't want to have to deal with free people that have due process.
[22:56.000 --> 22:59.000]  They want to consolidate control and power.
[22:59.000 --> 23:03.000]  So that's why we're out here today again, just get a little bit of a tour around D.C.
[23:03.000 --> 23:06.000]  and I want to make one other point before we come back to the next segment,
[23:06.000 --> 23:08.000]  break down the latest news and huge developments.
[23:08.000 --> 23:13.000]  I love all the groups that were here in D.C. for Trump and I don't normally come out to a lot of events.
[23:13.000 --> 23:15.000]  I don't normally come out and give big speeches.
[23:15.000 --> 23:18.000]  We do stuff digitally at M4s. We reach millions of people a day.
[23:18.000 --> 23:23.000]  And there have been a lot of different groups out here running demonstrations and having events.
[23:23.000 --> 23:27.000]  And any time I show up at one of those events, it becomes a big disturbance
[23:27.000 --> 23:30.000]  because so many people come over and start trying to talk to us.
[23:30.000 --> 23:36.000]  And I was going to the Supreme Court building yesterday because I heard it was going to be a rally that I was invited to.
[23:36.000 --> 23:38.000]  I didn't even know who was really doing it.
[23:38.000 --> 23:43.000]  I told a big crowd of people, hey, when this is over at the Jericho March, let's go over it at 4 o'clock to the Supreme Court.
[23:43.000 --> 23:47.000]  But an hour later, we get there. I'm walking up. There's a hill. People are standing there.
[23:47.000 --> 23:51.000]  I came to see what's happening. And a bunch of security guys kind of run into us and say,
[23:51.000 --> 23:54.000]  hey, you're not going to take over our stage.
[23:54.000 --> 23:56.000]  And so I said, that's fine. We're going to play that video in a moment.
[23:56.000 --> 23:59.000]  I said, hey, that's fine. Get your hands off me. We'll go over here.
[23:59.000 --> 24:03.000]  But then as soon as we walked away, everybody followed us away and went over there to hear me speak.
[24:03.000 --> 24:09.000]  And that's just because of the populism and how we helped launch the whole Trump phenomenon that anywhere I show up at these events,
[24:09.000 --> 24:13.000]  that happens. It's not like I was trying to go to some event with a thousand people and take it over.
[24:13.000 --> 24:16.000]  Like last night, they came and woke me up at 10 o'clock at night and said, you got to come out.
[24:16.000 --> 24:19.000]  There's 2,000 people outside the hotel when we hear you speak.
[24:19.000 --> 24:26.000]  And that's not about how famous I am. It's how famous liberty and freedom are that anywhere I go now, that's what's happening.
[24:26.000 --> 24:27.000]  And it's happening for so many others.
[24:27.000 --> 24:33.000]  So that's another bellwether of the excitement that's happening with the citizenry here dealing with liberty.
[24:33.000 --> 24:36.000]  Joe Biden can't get 100 people to his events.
[24:36.000 --> 24:45.000]  He's hiding behind COVID to say he's not going to have an outdoor inauguration because he knows he can't get crowds.
[24:45.000 --> 24:55.000]  And he knows we're coming here on January 20th, regardless to point out that America and the world know he's a globalist.
[24:55.000 --> 24:58.000]  We know he's trying to sell our country out and we're not going to submit to him.
[24:58.000 --> 25:04.000]  But I thought I'd also show this little bit of footage of Elijah Shaffer, a funny guy, good guy with the blaze, put out.
[25:04.000 --> 25:08.000]  And they called it, oh, you know, Pete Alex Jones, Jones tries to charge a stage.
[25:08.000 --> 25:12.000]  If I need to charge a stage, I can go speak at any of these stages I want to.
[25:12.000 --> 25:17.000]  But I'm the one that said, OK, finally we won't go up this hill that you own, this grassy hillopere.
[25:17.000 --> 25:19.000]  We'll go over here and speak, which we did.
[25:19.000 --> 25:22.000]  And then they thought we were trying to take over their events. Everybody came to listen to us.
[25:22.000 --> 25:29.000]  It doesn't matter. We're all on the same team. That's what InfoWars is about, is a platform to promote all these great guests, all these great people we have on.
[25:29.000 --> 25:34.000]  And I just love all the Trump folks. And some of us are libertarians. Some of us are more populist.
[25:34.000 --> 25:39.000]  Some of us are more super right wing. Other people are kind of mainline liberals, but they're anti-war.
[25:39.000 --> 25:42.000]  So they like Trump. Some of us are for decriminalization of drugs. It doesn't matter.
[25:42.000 --> 25:47.000]  We're all Americans from a race, color, and creed. We care about freedom, and that's what it all comes down to.
[25:47.000 --> 25:52.000]  So here's the video of what happened. I'm trying to find our own video, which we don't have of what happened right at the first.
[25:52.000 --> 25:57.000]  You can see they charge into us. We stop. We turn around. We leave. We're friends with those folks.
[25:57.000 --> 26:00.000]  Not sure who they are exactly, but everything's great. Here's that footage.
[26:00.000 --> 26:18.000]  Baby, I just got a little enthusiastic, but we're going to do it. Let's go to TrumpWatch.com.
[26:18.000 --> 26:38.000]  Let's go, let's go.
[26:38.000 --> 26:58.000]  Let's go, let's go.
[26:58.000 --> 27:16.000]  Let's go, let's go.
[27:16.000 --> 27:20.000]  Okay, so there's what actually happened at that event, not what some folks have been spinning.
[27:20.000 --> 27:30.000]  Let's move on to the really important news. Hunter Biden subpoenaed over Burisma, two dozen other entities as part of four criminal investigations.
[27:30.000 --> 27:40.000]  Communist China, the Ukrainians, the Russians, it's all being investigated, but it's being investigated by the same Justice Department that never does anything.
[27:40.000 --> 27:55.000]  And then if Joe Biden is able to insert himself into power, we've got a really, really serious problem, because then they'll get even more of their people in the Justice Department and more of their swamp creatures into the depths of these layers to be able to basically be above the law.
[27:55.000 --> 28:10.000]  If you think the Clintons and the Bushes and Obama were corrupt, Joe Biden doesn't even know what planet he's on. And so the lobbyists of special interest that are going to overrun Washington is a real national security crisis and a threat to the entire world.
[28:10.000 --> 28:18.000]  Now, let's get back to fake news. Hate to make ourselves the center of the news, but it's a great case point of the propaganda and disinfo.
[28:18.000 --> 28:32.000]  I gave that Jericho speech that you just saw last segment, where I said, Joe Biden's a reanimated corpse and he's not going to be our president one way or the other, whether he doesn't get in now, or whether we were moving with impeachment for being a global shycom agent.
[28:32.000 --> 28:44.000]  The media spun that, that I was saying that I want to kill Joe Biden. The last thing I want is to kill Joe Biden. That would turn him into a martyr, turn a horrible monster into a martyr.
[28:44.000 --> 28:57.000]  We want to kill the ideas he's pushing. We want to kill his agenda of bankrupting America and turning off our plants and cutting off our oil. We want to kill the new world order idea of tyranny. We don't want to hurt the puppet of it all.
[28:57.000 --> 29:18.000]  And then.
[29:18.000 --> 29:29.000]  This is exactly what all this overblown COVID-19 garbage is. You see the headlines from CNN ABC News doctors say it's worse than they ever thought COVID more devastating than ever imagined.
[29:29.000 --> 29:43.000]  They told us that two and a half million people would be dead just eight months ago within three months. Okay, it's a quarter million. If you count all of the people that died of other things, we're talking 96% had co-morbidity.
[29:43.000 --> 29:53.000]  These are real numbers. These are real facts. This is the chicken little event where we all run our houses, never come out and are taught we're not essential. Well, the big box stores in Amazon take over the planet.
[29:53.000 --> 30:01.000]  Rebuke it. Stand up against it. This is slavery. It is not something you can put up with and survive.
[30:01.000 --> 30:13.000]  If you think 2020 has been an insane and dangerous year, just wait until you see the year 2021. I'm Alex Jones. I started in full wars, but I couldn't have done any of this without you.
[30:13.000 --> 30:21.000]  And now in full wars is more important than ever because the general population of the planet is weighing up the fact that we've done our research and we've been dead on.
[30:21.000 --> 30:31.000]  It's so important to those of you out there that have supported the broadcast and the websites and the films and all the rest of the information we put out to realize how important your work has been and to redouble your efforts.

[31:44.000 --> 32:00.000]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube. However you want, be sure and share band.video.
[32:00.000 --> 32:08.000]  Most of the world submitted to the unconstitutional criminal lockdowns directed by the comics Chinese and the United Nations.
[32:08.000 --> 32:18.000]  And now because the slaves have proven themselves to be subservient, the worst Australian models of complete lockdowns you can't even leave your house for months and months are being announced.
[32:18.000 --> 32:29.000]  And in Germany, the police are using giant armored tanks with water cannons to blast men, women and children that protest the fact that Merkel, the dictator, has put them under her control.
[32:29.000 --> 32:36.000]  That's why she's been rigging elections for years and years. And the same thing is coming here to the United States. This is world government.
[32:36.000 --> 32:43.000]  In Philadelphia, they've announced four people or more seen together will be arrested. They're announcing the Christmas is canceled.
[32:43.000 --> 32:53.000]  This is what the communist takeover looks like to bankrupt you, to take rid of all your due process and absolutely transform the world into a prison planet.
[32:53.000 --> 33:00.000]  How long have we warned you about this? But you can fight back. America is the last bastion. Stop submitting.
[33:23.000 --> 33:30.000]  From enemies, born and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[33:30.000 --> 33:46.000]  So we've seen all these surrogates of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and their minion, their front man, the senile, empty suit Joe Biden saying that they wanted to kill Trump, that they want to destroy America, that they don't want our borders to even exist.
[33:46.000 --> 33:51.000]  They had our military. They hate the police. They hate everything because they want full control over society.
[33:51.000 --> 33:59.000]  Look at the latest article on infowars.com. Unity and healing. Joe Biden post pictures of dogs tearing up Trump doll.
[33:59.000 --> 34:03.000]  And sure, you can say that's funny. It actually is.
[34:03.000 --> 34:14.000]  But imagine if Trump posted images of Hillary being torn up by dogs. It would be the end of the world.
[34:14.000 --> 34:22.000]  And that's the thing about these people is that the rules they want you to play by, they don't play by.
[34:22.000 --> 34:27.000]  And they consistently get away with whatever they want, whenever they want.
[34:27.000 --> 34:43.000]  And when I try to explain to viewers and listeners how much danger all of us are in society by letting Joe Biden get into office through fraud, it's really unlimited how dangerous it is.
[34:43.000 --> 34:49.000]  And the numberless I've coined a term are dystopics.
[34:49.000 --> 34:58.000]  They believe in creating a dystopic future as a system of management and control because it's hard to build a good society and you're going to make mistakes.
[34:58.000 --> 35:09.000]  But if you artificially try to enslave and oppress people with authoritarianism and try to actually build a dystopia on purpose, then you're a dystopic.
[35:09.000 --> 35:18.000]  That's what this group is. And that's why you can never project onto them enough evil because that's who they are.
[35:18.000 --> 35:24.000]  You can never imagine any depths to them. That's what the Bible calls hell, a bottomless pit.
[35:24.000 --> 35:27.000]  Because there's no bottom to who these individuals are.
[35:27.000 --> 35:33.000]  We project our goodness, our decency, wanting to work with people, wanting to treat others like we want to be treated, onto them.
[35:33.000 --> 35:35.000]  And that's not how it works.
[35:35.000 --> 35:46.000]  For example, I've been here in D.C. for three days and I have talked to hundreds of people that have told me in restaurants and in hotels, hey, put your mask on.
[35:46.000 --> 35:56.000]  And I say, hey, listen, I know you're told to do that, but did you know that the new vaccine, MRNA vaccine has HIV in it?
[35:56.000 --> 35:59.000]  And that's why it's giving positive HIV tests.
[35:59.000 --> 36:09.000]  And they look at me and say, that's crazy. And I pull my phone out and I show them the Sydney Morning Herald and I explain that it has HIV in it and the HIV delivery system.
[36:09.000 --> 36:14.000]  And I've gotten a few people brought to tears because you know what? They should be brought to tears.
[36:14.000 --> 36:19.000]  You see those children? A lot of these parents are virtue signalers.
[36:19.000 --> 36:28.000]  And even though they're recommending in the UK children not have the COVID shot, the left as a sacrament of their subservience to the system
[36:28.000 --> 36:33.000]  are making two-year-old children wear a mask and are saying, we're going to inject our kids with more vaccines.
[36:33.000 --> 36:45.000]  And when they have convulsions or they become brain damaged, they love it because it is a symbol, like human sacrifice, where people will sacrifice their kids throughout history to the system
[36:45.000 --> 36:51.000]  and a symbol of how cuck they are and how they want to live completely and totally under the Stockholm syndrome.
[36:51.000 --> 36:57.000]  And here's an example of how the globalists are these dystopians that want to create a dystopic system.
[36:57.000 --> 37:07.000]  So again, they are the dystopians. They know full well that almost everyone that gets sick from COVID, which is a real virus every week,
[37:07.000 --> 37:14.000]  have a vitamin and mineral deficiency of zinc, vitamin D3 and C. If you have those, any virus will kill you.
[37:14.000 --> 37:23.000]  There's another major study out that 80% of people that have been hospitalized from COVID that are actually sick have a vitamin D deficiency in their blood test.
[37:23.000 --> 37:30.000]  Again, but that's buried news. And when all these medical doctors and all these scientists came out in the last 10 months and said,
[37:30.000 --> 37:37.000]  get your vitamin D3, get your zinc, get your C, the media said, that's BS. There's no treatment for COVID.
[37:37.000 --> 37:43.000]  Well, that's like saying there's no treatment for dying of thirst and malnutrition.
[37:43.000 --> 37:50.000]  Yes, there is drink water and you won't die of thirst. You won't die of dehydration.
[37:50.000 --> 37:59.000]  It's like saying there's no cure for not drowning in a pool. Well, if you're being held under in 10 feet of water by bowling balls tied to your legs,
[37:59.000 --> 38:09.000]  you're dying from lack of oxygen. So again, this very system has had the FBI raid medical doctors facilities in Michigan and other areas,
[38:09.000 --> 38:14.000]  because people had COVID and they wanted to come in and get an alternative treatment.
[38:14.000 --> 38:22.000]  There was a cocktail of vitamin D3, vitamin C, zinc and other things, strictly in their blood. Those places are all over the country and all the world because they work.
[38:22.000 --> 38:28.000]  I'm not a big medical guy, but I go in and get IVs sometimes. They make me feel wonderful with the same stuff and I'm not doing it for COVID.
[38:28.000 --> 38:37.000]  But we have free will in this country. But why would the dystopics tell you nothing can save you, nothing can help you,
[38:37.000 --> 38:51.000]  and then lie to you about if you're malmarished, any regular virus will kill you because they want to make the world a hellish place and then only they have the solutions that give them more power and more control.
[38:51.000 --> 38:59.000]  I'll be on the radio tomorrow. Harrison Smith is going to take over here in a few minutes, but the big news I just wanted to announce is they're trying to suppress the great awakening.
[38:59.000 --> 39:07.000]  Trump wanted a landslide, so as depressing as all this criminal theft is, they're being forced to do it in the power structure because they've been repudiated.
[39:07.000 --> 39:13.000]  They've been rejected and the whole world is turning against their globalist system right now.
[39:13.000 --> 39:20.000]  So don't get dejected. Realize that the fight against the New World Order has just begun.
[39:20.000 --> 39:31.000]  And everything the system does is to make you a victim and to make you give in to the system instead of you getting the knowledge and the information to overcome it and become aware of how you can defeat this system.
[39:31.000 --> 39:38.000]  And I want to be clear. It doesn't mean just because I have all this advice, I always follow around perfect. All of this is part of a process of life.
[39:38.000 --> 39:50.000]  But the first thing you've got to realize is the globalist are bad news. They're out to get you. Communist China is their model. And if you submit to them, things are only going to get worse.
[39:50.000 --> 40:00.000]  Now, there's so many other points I can go over and we've got a whole other hour plus coming up with Harrison Smith and then we've got Sunday Live continuing at an overdrive, 6 to 8 p.m. Central.
[40:00.000 --> 40:09.000]  But Owen Shroyer blew his voice out with all these big speeches, but I'm making him get over here. He's been whispering in my ear during the breaks telling me some key points I've been making.
[40:09.000 --> 40:22.000]  Well, yeah, I probably sound like hell. Someday I'll probably eventually sound like Alex over there. But, you know, losing my voice for a week or a couple days or, you know, extending a little voice trauma for even the rest of my life is barely a sacrifice.
[40:22.000 --> 40:36.000]  You know, I was just over at the Korean War Memorial and my grandfather fought in the Korean War. And so, you know, many great men, better than us, better than we can even imagine, put everything on the line for this country.
[40:36.000 --> 40:46.000]  So for me to be yelling for a week straight and having all these rallies and, you know, dealing with the voice issues, you know, it's a small price to pay. It's a small price to pay for freedom.
[40:46.000 --> 41:01.000]  It's a small price to pay to live in America, which is all I want. I just want to live in a free country. And I hope I'd be, I'd be blessed if my voice is the only thing I have to sacrifice, because many men before me had to sacrifice much, much more.
[41:01.000 --> 41:07.000]  In fact, many made the ultimate sacrifice and we know what that is. And we honor that with all the great war memorials that we see out here.
[41:07.000 --> 41:16.000]  So more people, though, are stepping up and putting their lives on the line. More people are realizing that if they don't step up and fight now, they're going to have nothing left to fight for.
[41:16.000 --> 41:28.000]  So this is the next great fight for America. This is the next great historical battle for the future of America. Call it the great American Renaissance. Call it the great American Awakening, the World Awakening, 1776 worldwide, American Revolution 2.0.
[41:28.000 --> 41:37.000]  But we're in it. It's an honor to be in it with you. And you know, in full wars, it's going to put it all on the line, victory or death, liberty or death.
[41:37.000 --> 41:48.000]  Thank you. Oh, and great points. I'm going to say this in closing the hand about time to Harrison Smith. We're not giving in. We're not backing down because giving in and backing down only makes things worse in the future.
[41:48.000 --> 42:02.000]  Joe Biden's illegitimate. The U.N.'s illegitimate. Gigi Ping and the Communist Chinese are illegitimate. This whole satanic leftist system and the universities and the big banks are all criminal parasitic frauds, domesticating you and dumbing you down to control you.
[42:02.000 --> 42:08.000]  That's why they've got to be opposed. So I want to thank you all for your support. I want to tell you, we can't finance this and fight this hard without your support.
[42:08.000 --> 42:23.000]  So do your Christmas shopping at infowarstore.com, get great products, get all of our immune system, boosting systems, and so much more like DNA Force Plus, X2, X3, Brosteguard, Winter Sun, and so much more at infowarstore.com.
[42:23.000 --> 42:35.000]  We're going to go to break. Harrison is coming up. He's got more highlights of the big marches and events and a lot of the gigantic breaking news. Stay with us. The revolution is televised.
[42:35.000 --> 42:46.000]  And I want to salute you all. I want to salute you all for your individuality. I salute you.
[42:46.000 --> 42:59.000]  President Trump won by a landslide. The pedophile Joe Biden is a globalist operative in America and the world is not accepting this.
[42:59.000 --> 43:11.000]  I've got some really exciting good news and I've also got some bad news. Info Wars is getting the highest traffic we have ever gotten since the election in 2016.
[43:11.000 --> 43:25.000]  Despite all the bans, all of the system trying to censor us and suppress us, you with your word of mouth have overridden that and they are so scared of InfoWars.com and banned on video and they're so scared of you being able to communicate and share the truth.
[43:25.000 --> 43:33.000]  But we're bringing in the same amount of money we brought in last December right now. This is our most important month to fund ourselves in the next year.
[43:33.000 --> 43:38.000]  And I understand the economy shut down. I understand there's not as much money as they're used to be. They're trying to kill Trump's recovery.
[43:38.000 --> 43:46.000]  But InfoWars really needs your support. You just buy great items. Do your Christmas shopping at infowarstore.com with huge sales, amazing products.
[43:46.000 --> 43:59.000]  And then you know you're funding the Info War and not funding Amazon and Jeff Bezos and the globalists that are openly trying to destroy small businesses. Continue to fund the Second American Revolution while getting great products at the same time at infowarstore.com. Thank you.
[44:17.000 --> 44:27.000]  Now at the most critical time, not just at InfoWars history, but this country's history, you have invested in InfoWars. You've prayed for us. You've spread the word. You've bought the products.
[44:27.000 --> 44:38.000]  And you've gotten the benefits of the information warfare of the truth in the fight against the globalist. But now is the time to redouble all our efforts in praying for a great awakening which is starting to happen.
[44:38.000 --> 44:48.000]  And spreading the word about infowars.com, newswars.com, and band.video. And at the very same time, buying amazing products at infowarstore.com.
[44:48.000 --> 44:56.000]  They have some of the biggest sales, if not the biggest of the year, certainly on some items, the biggest sales of the year on nutraceuticals, you name it, at infowarstore.com.
[44:56.000 --> 45:09.000]  So thanks for your support, get those orders in, and God bless.
[45:26.000 --> 45:36.000]  So today we're going to talk about the mRNA vaccines, and they are an example of the mRNA vaccine.
[45:36.000 --> 45:51.000]  They are recombinant DNA from aborted cloned fetuses, where they inserted into your genome to take over your body's systems.
[45:51.000 --> 45:54.760]  takeover. Whether it's interdimensional, whether it's little green men, the
[45:54.760 --> 45:57.440]  globalists are acting like another species that's overtaking us and
[45:57.440 --> 46:01.280]  overriding us. It's all the same in the end. The Pope came out yesterday and
[46:01.280 --> 46:05.480]  announced a global government corporate alliance to redistribute wealth and
[46:05.480 --> 46:09.520]  create a planetary universal income, which of course the United Nations and
[46:09.520 --> 46:12.900]  Global Corporations will control through the apps on your phone and finally a
[46:12.900 --> 46:17.400]  chip under your skin. It's all now completely official. Part of the UN
[46:17.400 --> 46:22.400]  great reset of the Davos group and Klaus Schwab, all officially written about in
[46:22.400 --> 46:25.920]  hundreds of books by Schwab and Rockefeller Foundation, all the rest of
[46:25.920 --> 46:30.720]  them, at 10 to 21, at 20 to 30, gets here and only gets worse like being fed into a
[46:30.720 --> 46:36.840]  wood chipper or a meat grinder until you reject it all. And the rejection starts
[46:36.840 --> 46:42.240]  with realizing it's spiritual battle, diverse, evil, and stopping abortion. We
[46:42.240 --> 46:46.320]  must start valuing human life again. We must start saying that we are not
[46:46.320 --> 46:52.080]  expendable, that we are not disposable, that we are essential. Until we do that,
[46:52.080 --> 46:57.200]  we are all slaves. We must stand up and declare our basic God-given human rights
[46:57.200 --> 46:59.440]  now.
[46:59.440 --> 47:21.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. There's a big discussion as Americans,
[47:21.240 --> 47:26.160]  as patriots, as populists, as Christians, as parents, and just as humans we have to
[47:26.160 --> 47:33.440]  have. What do we do politically to make sure that the Trumpian revolution that
[47:33.440 --> 47:38.040]  we created and we pushed to populism continues? Is the Republican Party
[47:38.040 --> 47:42.120]  betraying President Trump by not backing him further? Has the Supreme Court done
[47:42.120 --> 47:46.840]  it? Absolutely. We're about to show you a viral clip of Nick Fuentes yesterday
[47:46.840 --> 47:51.880]  speaking to over 100,000 people and the video has over 5 million views, just one
[47:51.880 --> 47:57.520]  version because it resonates with people that we need to destroy the GOP. Now I'm
[47:57.520 --> 48:01.360]  not disagreeing with Nick Fuentes. I get his position. I understand we need to
[48:01.360 --> 48:07.520]  destroy the establishment GOP, but what about take over the GOP? What about
[48:07.520 --> 48:12.280]  continue what we did with Trump before their counter-establishment revolution
[48:12.280 --> 48:17.800]  now we fully take it over? I think we should take over the GOP, not destroy
[48:17.800 --> 48:21.080]  the GOP. I think we should take over the Democratic Party with you. That'd be
[48:21.080 --> 48:24.280]  easier. We probably can't. It's destroying America. It's global. It's
[48:24.280 --> 48:27.720]  here to get rid of the nation. But here's the clip of Nick Fuentes, then we'll get
[48:27.720 --> 48:57.560]  Owen Troyer's take on this.
[49:28.040 --> 49:35.920]  Nick Fuentes is a smart guy. I like Nick Fuentes. I think his heart's in the right
[49:35.920 --> 49:40.520]  place and I'm not saying he's wrong. I think we should destroy the Rhino
[49:40.520 --> 49:44.560]  establishment GOP and get more Trumpist, more nationalist, more
[49:44.560 --> 49:48.880]  info warriors elected. I think that's the answer. I've seen Twitter and others not
[49:48.880 --> 49:52.080]  blocking videos like this because they kind of want to drive a wedge, but just
[49:52.080 --> 49:55.000]  because they think it drives the wedge, I don't think it does. I think we say we
[49:55.000 --> 50:00.160]  take over the GOP. You know, I think that people just tend to forget that the
[50:00.160 --> 50:04.880]  Republican Party didn't want Trump four years ago. And so it's kind of this, you
[50:04.880 --> 50:08.280]  know, after they pretended to like Trump or made some deals with Trump, you know,
[50:08.280 --> 50:12.920]  now we're in this place where we realize, oh wait, they never had our back to begin
[50:12.920 --> 50:16.600]  with. Trump's nominees, the Supreme Court stabbed us. The Republican Party is
[50:16.600 --> 50:19.120]  letting the Democrats steal the election. So I think it's a matter of that
[50:19.120 --> 50:24.360]  reminder that the Republican Party tried to reject Trump in 2015 and 2016 and we
[50:24.360 --> 50:28.040]  just overcame that. And then they kind of played along and got along with us. But
[50:28.040 --> 50:31.280]  now they're back to normal establishment politics. That's right. You just said it
[50:31.280 --> 50:35.520]  way better than I can. I went short. It's why I love Owen. Absolutely. Are we
[50:35.520 --> 50:39.240]  feeling like we're crestfallen or we've been rode hard, put away wet that the
[50:39.240 --> 50:43.000]  Republican establishment doesn't like Trump? When we won and forced his agenda
[50:43.000 --> 50:46.600]  through, they bid their time and claim they were for Trump because of the
[50:46.600 --> 50:50.960]  support. So I think we destroy the neo-cons and the globalist Republican
[50:50.960 --> 50:55.240]  Party, but we make our main focus on the Democrats and on the Senate seats in
[50:55.240 --> 50:59.480]  Georgia and on taking control of the House of Senate and removing rhinos and
[50:59.480 --> 51:03.040]  removing neo-cons and putting populist patriots in. And that goes for
[51:03.040 --> 51:05.880]  Democrats too, like Tulsi Gatwards or others. If people want to be more
[51:05.880 --> 51:08.600]  populist and liberal, they should be supported in districts that are going to
[51:08.600 --> 51:12.760]  go Democrat anyways. We should have a takeover of populism in the Democratic
[51:12.760 --> 51:16.160]  Party and the Republican Party. Owen? Yeah, there've been a couple Democrats that
[51:16.160 --> 51:19.600]  even switched Republican, Verne Jones is obviously one of the big ones. There's
[51:19.600 --> 51:22.640]  another one on the East Coast, I forget the gentleman's name. So I think that
[51:22.640 --> 51:26.360]  populism and just really just logic and common sense is what needs to rue the
[51:26.360 --> 51:30.720]  day for whatever party wants to be successful into the future. That's right.
[51:30.720 --> 51:34.160]  I'm gonna ask Nick Fuentes right now, as soon as we stop here, I'm gonna call him,
[51:34.160 --> 51:36.920]  say, please come on the Monday show, because I want to run into him almost here.
[51:36.920 --> 51:40.640]  I miss Roger Stone and him. But hey, we're on a cult. We don't all agree with the
[51:40.640 --> 51:43.840]  exact same thing. We're all going in the same direction. Freedom, liberty, you know,
[51:43.840 --> 51:47.920]  a pro-human future. But those that are attacking Fuentes for saying this, hey, the
[51:47.920 --> 51:51.280]  Republican Party establishments the enemy. And people that want to destroy them
[51:51.280 --> 51:55.360]  are the good guys. You can differ on what does that destruction mean? I mean to
[51:55.360 --> 51:59.680]  take it over. I'm Alan Jones. This is MFullWars.com and NewsWars.com. And now
[51:59.680 --> 52:04.360]  Harrison Smith takes over. Stay with us. Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. This is
[52:04.360 --> 52:08.320]  Harrison Smith taking over for Alex Jones, who is right now in Washington, D.C.
[52:08.320 --> 52:14.320]  with a who's who, a full cast of right wing dissidents of true American
[52:14.320 --> 52:19.080]  patriots there celebrating the Trump victory, which is really what it was. And
[52:19.080 --> 52:23.880]  there are still several paths towards victory that Trump is going to take, one
[52:23.880 --> 52:30.600]  of these being sort of the final parachute pull of declaring an insurrection and
[52:30.600 --> 52:35.400]  doing things militarily. But that's still a little bit down the line. But so much
[52:35.400 --> 52:39.400]  news today, it's almost outrageous. We have, of course, breaking news about
[52:39.400 --> 52:44.600]  Hunter Biden. We have the leaked files exposing mass infiltration of firms all
[52:44.600 --> 52:48.600]  around the world by the Chinese Communist Party. I will I will be breaking
[52:48.600 --> 52:55.160]  that down for you as well. More political news with the COVID-19 deal, more
[52:55.160 --> 52:59.680]  outrageous activity by the Democrats. Of course, last night and all of
[52:59.680 --> 53:04.880]  yesterday in Washington, D.C. was in many places a total bloodbath four
[53:04.880 --> 53:09.600]  stabbed during battles between Black Lives Matter activists and what has the
[53:09.600 --> 53:14.160]  daily mail puts at the defeated presidents, supporters in Washington, D.C. The
[53:14.160 --> 53:18.840]  as of yet still president of the United States, Donald Trump supporters, proud
[53:18.840 --> 53:22.880]  boys out there protecting people who were there showing their support for the
[53:22.880 --> 53:25.960]  president. Because I don't know if you remember this. I know so much happens
[53:25.960 --> 53:30.320]  that it's sometimes impossible to cast your mind back into the far distant
[53:30.320 --> 53:35.120]  past of just a few weeks ago when the million MAGA March as it was wrapping
[53:35.120 --> 53:40.080]  up as the sun was going down suddenly out from the shadows from the alleys and
[53:40.080 --> 53:45.760]  the the underways of Washington, D.C. crawled and Tifa and Black Lives Matter
[53:45.760 --> 53:53.720]  these mask clad black wearing terrorists coming out to attack and bash and
[53:53.720 --> 53:59.920]  yell at and stab I mean just all out anarchy to absolutely destroy the
[53:59.920 --> 54:02.920]  peaceful protesters that were there protesting and stop the steal for the
[54:02.920 --> 54:07.720]  million MAGA March. That didn't happen last night. Last night those terrorists
[54:07.720 --> 54:14.120]  those evil scumbags who were around attacking families and elderly people
[54:14.120 --> 54:21.720]  and young couples who are all there just absolutely terrorizing everybody
[54:21.720 --> 54:26.240]  involved in the million MAGA March several weeks ago. Well now they had a
[54:26.240 --> 54:30.400]  defense force now they had a backup now the proud boys were there to make sure
[54:30.400 --> 54:35.240]  that those innocent protesters were not targeted by Black Lives Matter. I think
[54:35.240 --> 54:38.480]  I think all four of these people who have been stabbed are still in critical
[54:38.480 --> 54:43.880]  condition cops made at least 23 arrests during the event. It was a massive
[54:43.880 --> 54:47.880]  massive showing you had Michael Flynn Alex Jones and Ricci Tario of the proud
[54:47.880 --> 54:52.280]  boys. I mean everybody who's anybody on this side not even just this side of the
[54:52.280 --> 54:55.680]  aisle this side of this side of the aisle. You've got the aisle down the
[54:55.680 --> 54:59.200]  middle that's the left and the right of the Democrats and the Republicans there's
[54:59.200 --> 55:05.440]  still a distinct divide between the blue blood establishment Republicans the
[55:05.440 --> 55:10.200]  respectable Republicans who will very respectably go down with the ship will
[55:10.200 --> 55:17.640]  very respectably allow the Democrats to cheat them out of a country versus the
[55:17.640 --> 55:23.640]  pro-America America first dissident right and that's the Alex Joneses that's
[55:23.640 --> 55:28.840]  the Nick Fuenteses the Roger Stones the Donald J. Trump's of the party and so it
[55:28.840 --> 55:34.160]  was a massive showing and so even in just that we can take a massive victory lap
[55:34.160 --> 55:39.920]  I saw somebody on Twitter yesterday say I never thought I would see Alex Jones go
[55:39.920 --> 55:43.440]  mainstream and it was under that video that you saw earlier in the program of
[55:43.440 --> 55:47.720]  Alex Jones speaking to an absolutely massive crowd getting cheers at his
[55:47.720 --> 55:53.840]  every word his very name elicits a massive eruption of support from whichever
[55:53.840 --> 55:58.360]  crowd he's getting in front of this is something unprecedented and it's for one
[55:58.360 --> 56:02.040]  simple reason it's because Alex Jones tells the truth because we here at
[56:02.040 --> 56:08.400]  info wars have done everything we can to reveal the lies and destroy the plans of
[56:08.400 --> 56:12.720]  the globalist to put us under a worldwide system of total control and
[56:12.720 --> 56:17.920]  people who are aware and people who are fair-minded people who are open-minded
[56:17.920 --> 56:22.320]  people who are simply pro-human see that recognize that and respond to that
[56:22.320 --> 56:27.920]  regardless of how the mainstream right or left may try to demonize us you know
[56:27.920 --> 56:33.000]  it's really it's it's kind of incredible it's just on a personal note you know I
[56:33.000 --> 56:36.840]  had a write-up recently in the Austin Chronicle they're quoting the ADL and
[56:36.840 --> 56:41.080]  they're calling me a racist and anti-Semite they say my toxic rage
[56:41.080 --> 56:46.560]  target targets blacks and the LGBT none of this is true and my family sees
[56:46.560 --> 56:50.200]  this they go what the hell is going on here why are they calling you all of
[56:50.200 --> 56:53.640]  these things this is horrible it's like I have to remind them I'm an enemy of the
[56:53.640 --> 56:58.680]  state not the American state not the United States I'm not an enemy of
[56:58.680 --> 57:03.920]  patriots I'm not an enemy of those that want to do good and want to uphold our
[57:03.920 --> 57:08.840]  constitutional republic but I am an enemy of the subversive state of the
[57:08.840 --> 57:13.660]  global state of the World Organization the World Health Organization and the
[57:13.660 --> 57:18.400]  UN and the ADL and the SPLC and all of these non-governmental organizations that
[57:18.400 --> 57:21.640]  are telling our government what to do telling our government who to censor in
[57:21.640 --> 57:26.360]  controlling our big tech and everybody else that's circumventing our freedoms
[57:26.360 --> 57:30.960]  so it's it's an interesting position to be in here I am not a racist not an
[57:30.960 --> 57:35.400]  anti-Semite love women love men love everybody and yet I'm an enemy of the
[57:35.400 --> 57:38.160]  state and that's just what you have to deal with I guess as a patriotic
[57:38.160 --> 57:41.960]  American the good news is that's turning around the good news is we are rapidly

[1:00:15.960 --> 1:00:35.800]  info war. Patriots marched and spoke at the stop the steel rally in
[1:00:35.800 --> 1:00:39.680]  Washington DC knowing that the glue that held America together had
[1:00:39.680 --> 1:00:44.160]  disintegrated after the betrayal of the Supreme Court decision which blatantly
[1:00:44.160 --> 1:00:48.200]  ignored our constitutional republic.
[1:01:14.160 --> 1:01:26.920]  Americans from all walks of life many who fought in foreign wars for this
[1:01:26.920 --> 1:01:31.680]  country protested against all of the propaganda skewing their message. So
[1:01:31.680 --> 1:01:36.440]  it's amazing to be here in DC today standing up for the president of the
[1:01:36.440 --> 1:01:41.120]  United States saying we will not bow to the propaganda that the mainstream media
[1:01:41.120 --> 1:01:48.960]  keeps pushing down our throat we will not bow we want the truth and stop the
[1:01:48.960 --> 1:01:57.680]  steel they are trying to steal they are trying to steal this country not just
[1:01:57.680 --> 1:02:02.320]  from the president but from us. The smug left came out in droves on Twitter
[1:02:02.320 --> 1:02:06.560]  some calling for the arrest of Alex Jones for saying something countless
[1:02:06.560 --> 1:02:11.120]  mockingbird media pundits and celebrities had been saying for the past four
[1:02:11.120 --> 1:02:22.160]  years let me give you one bottom line as former government official government's
[1:02:22.160 --> 1:02:26.780]  gonna kill this guy as expected the goons of radical socialism brought their
[1:02:26.780 --> 1:02:31.640]  brainwashed useful idiot monotony to the Patriots who had taken the gloves off
[1:02:31.640 --> 1:02:35.920]  local police tried repeatedly to separate the Patriots and the communists
[1:02:35.920 --> 1:02:41.760]  and as the night wore on that became increasingly more difficult to do
[46:23.920 --> 1:03:33.280]  media will spin all of the events in this report as right
[1:03:33.280 --> 1:03:38.120]  wing extremism intimidation and threats to election officials and lawmakers are
[1:03:38.120 --> 1:03:42.640]  feeding fears about violence amid calls by president Trump supporters to stop
[1:03:42.640 --> 1:03:47.720]  the certification of election results but at this point even they know it's
[1:03:47.720 --> 1:04:17.640]  simply Americans fighting for their lives John Bowne reported

[1:05:02.120 --> 1:05:06.040]  warfare the united nations the big corporations the globalist big tech
[1:05:06.040 --> 1:05:09.360]  and big farmer all pushing the cub is the most deadly thing in history even
[1:05:09.360 --> 1:05:14.080]  though statistically it's a very weak flu or cold but if you are deficient
[1:05:14.080 --> 1:05:17.280]  then you can actually die from it that's why you should be dying inside the
[1:05:17.280 --> 1:05:22.160]  nursing homes meanwhile all these top scientists and researchers and former
[1:05:22.160 --> 1:05:26.320]  Pfizer head medical officers have come out and said that the COVID-19 vaccine
[1:05:26.320 --> 1:05:30.520]  especially mRNA ones are basically bio weapons that are super deadly and now
[1:05:30.520 --> 1:05:34.680]  they're having to resuscitate people that die basically when they take it just
[1:05:34.680 --> 1:05:37.920]  like newborn babies they give vaccines they have to resuscitate them all the
[1:05:37.920 --> 1:05:41.360]  time or a lot of times they just let them die and that's on the record it does
[1:05:41.360 --> 1:05:45.880]  that gion berets narcolepsy cancer all these other diseases but they tell you
[1:05:45.880 --> 1:05:48.920]  safe and effective no one's getting hurt it's a conspiracy theory and then all
[1:05:48.920 --> 1:05:52.720]  the fine princess can kill you absolutely deadly so they run from
[1:05:52.720 --> 1:05:55.640]  something that isn't dangerous towards something that is incredibly dangerous
[1:05:55.640 --> 1:05:59.600]  because the media says it's safe they do it

[1:06:16.800 --> 1:06:20.480]  remember in these days where small businesses are shutting down left and
[1:06:20.480 --> 1:06:24.880]  right info wars is in fact a small business we have a single owner we're
[1:06:24.880 --> 1:06:29.280]  not part of some massive conglomerate we're not owned by univision that's
[1:06:29.280 --> 1:06:33.960]  in turn owned by time Warner that's in turn owned by Goldman Sachs which is in
[1:06:33.960 --> 1:06:37.640]  turn owned by black rock no no none of that now we're a small independent
[1:06:37.640 --> 1:06:40.880]  business we aren't even sponsored by those people we don't even take their
[1:06:40.880 --> 1:06:44.920]  commercials on our programs now everything you see here all of the
[1:06:44.920 --> 1:06:51.040]  political act division activism that you see in washington dc the two massive
[1:06:51.040 --> 1:06:55.400]  unparalleled expressions of patriotism with the million maga march and the

[1:07:04.760 --> 1:07:09.640]  absolutely every even the development of bandod video I mean it's incredible what
[1:07:09.640 --> 1:07:13.360]  we've been able to achieve and when I say we I mean all of us not just here at
[1:07:13.360 --> 1:07:17.040]  info wars but you out there as well by sharing the stories by shopping info
[1:07:17.040 --> 1:07:20.640]  wars store dot com by supporting us or praying for us we have all done this
[1:07:20.640 --> 1:07:24.440]  together so it's incredible what we've been able to achieve but folks we're
[1:07:24.440 --> 1:07:28.240]  just getting started people are just waking up as president trump tweeted out
[1:07:28.240 --> 1:07:34.160]  yesterday quoting the the founder of the american navy of course Alex Jones says
[1:07:34.160 --> 1:07:38.000]  it all the time we have just begun to fight or in another way if you're
[1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:42.360]  looking for a fight you better believe you got one you know it's interesting as
[1:07:42.360 --> 1:07:46.520]  I go through all of these stories that we have in front of me today I'm once
[1:07:46.520 --> 1:07:52.280]  again sort of having trouble figuring out how to put them into different
[1:07:52.280 --> 1:07:57.160]  categories you've got China over here you've got the election over here you've
[1:07:57.160 --> 1:08:00.400]  got them stealing the election you've got Biden but then you've got Biden and
[1:08:00.400 --> 1:08:04.560]  his engagement with China and then you've got China influencing YouTube to
[1:08:04.560 --> 1:08:07.840]  censor things about Biden it's all interconnected and this is why it can be
[1:08:07.840 --> 1:08:13.240]  so complicated to express some of this stuff at times because you can't just
[1:08:13.240 --> 1:08:15.440]  say one thing you can't just point out one thing you point out one thing and
[1:08:15.440 --> 1:08:19.200]  hey that doesn't sound great but it's probably just one person never attribute
[1:08:19.200 --> 1:08:24.320]  to malice what can be explained by a big ol oopsie by an accident yet another
[1:08:24.320 --> 1:08:29.240]  glitch you know I'm doing a I'm gonna I'm working on a year in review and it's
[1:08:29.240 --> 1:08:33.280]  it's insurmountable I mean just the sheer number of stories that came out
[1:08:33.280 --> 1:08:37.360]  the just the sheer number of stuff that happened to this year is almost impossible
[1:08:37.360 --> 1:08:44.080]  to quantify but anyway it's almost impossible so you have to you have to
[1:08:44.080 --> 1:08:48.280]  try to draw the lines between everything so where we're gonna start here is with
[1:08:48.280 --> 1:08:53.840]  one overarching theme that you find suffused in all of these stories and
[1:08:53.840 --> 1:09:00.880]  that's hypocrisy overwhelming hypocrisy complete lies told with a straight face
[1:09:00.880 --> 1:09:05.200]  it's shocking really when you see some of these pictures here's a story from
[1:09:05.200 --> 1:09:09.800]  news wars dot-com unity in healing Joe Biden post pictures of dogs tearing up
[1:09:09.800 --> 1:09:15.040]  a Trump doll from news wars dot-com in another show of hypocrisy from Biden the
[1:09:15.040 --> 1:09:18.680]  Instagram account for his dogs major in champ posted a picture of the pups playing
[1:09:18.680 --> 1:09:23.080]  tug-of-war with the Trump rag doll what he's previously said is quote when the
[1:09:23.080 --> 1:09:26.320]  campaign is over it's time to put the anger and the harsh rhetoric behind us
[1:09:26.320 --> 1:09:31.360]  and come together as a nation it's time for America to unite and to heal oh by
[1:09:31.360 --> 1:09:37.160]  the way here is a picture of my dogs tearing Donald Trump apart yeah unity in
[1:09:37.160 --> 1:09:43.760]  healing wonderful stuff thank you mr. president elect it's absurd but it's not
[1:09:43.760 --> 1:09:46.480]  just the rhetoric and of course we've seen the rhetoric all over the place
[1:09:46.480 --> 1:09:49.560]  we've seen it for the last four years we saw it before Trump even got into
[1:09:49.560 --> 1:09:57.800]  office we saw it during the 2016 election campaign but this is not this is
[1:09:57.800 --> 1:10:02.280]  not fear mongering this is not to say oh my gosh they're coming for us oh you
[1:10:02.280 --> 1:10:05.200]  know they're gonna they're gonna come for you at night no no they are making
[1:10:05.200 --> 1:10:08.440]  plans they are telling you what they're going to do so this is from the
[1:10:08.440 --> 1:10:15.240]  independent.co.uk will Trump be arrested as Biden gets sworn in as president they
[1:10:15.240 --> 1:10:19.320]  say imagine the scene come the 20th of January it's a frigid day in Washington
[1:10:19.320 --> 1:10:23.720]  both since inside and outside the White House in capital and throughout this
[1:10:23.720 --> 1:10:29.960]  story they are illustrating they are writing a fantasy story about Donald
[1:10:29.960 --> 1:10:33.640]  Trump being arrested but saying this is exactly what could actually happen they
[1:10:33.640 --> 1:10:37.880]  say you know Joe Biden is there being inaugurated Trump isn't at the
[1:10:37.880 --> 1:10:42.360]  inauguration he's flying off to Florida to start his new life as a as a citizen
[1:10:42.360 --> 1:10:46.680]  they say once Trump and Melania walk down the mobile stairs off of Air Force
[1:10:46.680 --> 1:10:49.360]  One or what would then be executive once since he would no longer be the
[1:10:49.360 --> 1:10:53.720]  president as Trump and Melania walk down the mobile stairs and onto the Florida
[1:10:53.720 --> 1:10:57.160]  soil to begin the next phase of their lives there's confusion where will the
[1:10:57.160 --> 1:11:03.320]  questioning take place after a heated scuffle caught on camera by tens of local
[1:11:03.320 --> 1:11:07.000]  national international media outlets on hand at Palm Beach International Airport
[1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:10.040]  to chronicle his return to civilian life the FBI team in the Secret Service
[1:11:10.040 --> 1:11:15.680]  detail agree he'll ride in the USS suburban with the federal agents vehicles
[1:11:15.680 --> 1:11:20.440]  falling in behind in a mixed motorcade imagine the split screens on television
[1:11:20.440 --> 1:11:25.080]  across the country in the world on one side a smiling and abulient Joseph
[1:11:25.080 --> 1:11:28.960]  Robinette Biden Jr. he's waving to supporters as he prepares to enter the
[1:11:28.960 --> 1:11:33.200]  Oval Office as president for the first time on the other a dower faced an angry
[1:11:33.200 --> 1:11:37.560]  Don Donald John Trump is seen tapping on his iPhone and then yelling at someone
[1:11:37.560 --> 1:11:41.360]  unlucky enough to be on the other side of his first phone call as an official
[1:11:41.360 --> 1:11:47.960]  federal criminal suspect absolutely incredible I mean it's a fantasy I mean
[1:11:47.960 --> 1:11:51.200]  you can see the person drooling at their out of their mouth while they write
[1:11:51.200 --> 1:11:55.880]  this I mean this is their fantasy that they're portraying but this is based on
[1:11:55.880 --> 1:12:00.880]  real cases this is based on a reality this is based on Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
[1:12:00.880 --> 1:12:04.360]  and several other members of the United States government saying we must
[1:12:04.360 --> 1:12:08.920]  prosecute Trump and his supporters the minute he's out of office so I hope
[1:12:08.920 --> 1:12:13.840]  Republicans understand the threat that they are under I hope Trump understands
[1:12:13.840 --> 1:12:18.360]  the threat that he's under that this will not just go away that once the
[1:12:18.360 --> 1:12:23.120]  election is over if Joe Biden gets into office which I think is increasingly
[1:12:23.120 --> 1:12:27.880]  rare the likelihood that that would happen but if that does take place they're
[1:12:27.880 --> 1:12:31.600]  going to come after you with everything they can and for the American people out
[1:12:31.600 --> 1:12:34.880]  there don't think you're gonna get off the hook don't think you're going to be
[1:12:34.880 --> 1:12:38.720]  let off for supporting the person that they have determined is a criminal so
[1:12:38.720 --> 1:12:43.480]  right now there are at least 12 federal and state investigations into Trump his
[1:12:43.480 --> 1:12:47.360]  2016 campaign and his business dealings according to a list compiled by the New
[1:12:47.360 --> 1:12:52.120]  York Times so our country is dead I hope everybody realizes that the idea of a
[1:12:52.120 --> 1:12:58.000]  free and fair republic based on a constitution is over they're openly
[1:12:58.000 --> 1:13:04.040]  talking about political prosecutions persecutions they're going to use every
[1:13:04.040 --> 1:13:10.360]  ounce of power that they're granted by their sheep-like zombie zombified
[1:13:10.360 --> 1:13:15.160]  of followers who vote for these people for God knows what reason they're gonna
[1:13:15.160 --> 1:13:19.400]  use every ounce of power that they're given to target us with everything that
[1:13:19.400 --> 1:13:23.280]  they've got anybody that ever supported Trump anybody that looks like Trump
[1:13:23.280 --> 1:13:26.080]  anybody that Trump's ever had business with by the way I don't know if you
[1:13:26.080 --> 1:13:29.960]  remember this again we're we're going back into the past which is so difficult
[1:13:29.960 --> 1:13:34.880]  to do these days with the media outlying and obfuscating everything that has
[1:13:34.880 --> 1:13:44.200]  come before in true 1984 style four years of investigation two years of un
[1:13:44.200 --> 1:13:50.200]  unregulated unlimited 50 million dollars of investigation into Trump and
[1:13:50.200 --> 1:13:54.440]  everybody who ever talked to anybody that ever talked to Trump we've had
[1:13:54.440 --> 1:13:57.240]  these investigations that's not enough they're gonna they're gonna find
[1:13:57.240 --> 1:14:00.400]  something they're gonna go in there and find something to try to pin on Donald
[1:14:00.400 --> 1:14:06.040]  Trump and the minute he's out of office they're going to try to throw him in
[1:14:06.040 --> 1:14:12.080]  jail so this is where we are as a country things are not normal anymore and
[1:14:12.080 --> 1:14:17.280]  it's not us that made it that way I want to make that perfectly clear and of
[1:14:17.280 --> 1:14:23.480]  course you had that what a congresswoman I guess from I think Milwaukee come out
[1:14:23.480 --> 1:14:26.480]  and say you know the soldiers her soldiers need to make Trump supporters
[1:14:26.480 --> 1:14:31.360]  pay just the latest in a long line of thinly veiled threats at Trump
[1:14:31.360 --> 1:14:36.160]  supporters this guy named Tom Elliott tried to post that video showing that
[1:14:36.160 --> 1:14:41.040]  threat showing her making threats to Trump supporters on a political basis
[1:14:41.040 --> 1:14:44.160]  something that should be treated as treason and should be punished
[1:14:44.160 --> 1:14:48.000]  accordingly but he says YouTube doesn't want people knowing about Democratic
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:51.760]  lawmakers threatening the lives of Trump voters not newsworthy I guess and he
[1:14:51.760 --> 1:14:56.560]  posts a screenshot of a message from YouTube to him saying hi our team has
[1:14:56.560 --> 1:14:59.800]  reviewed your content and unfortunately we think it violates our violent
[1:14:59.800 --> 1:15:03.720]  criminal organizations policy we've removed the following content from
[1:15:03.720 --> 1:15:08.400]  YouTube the video was quote make them pay Michigan Democratic State Rep Cynthia
[1:15:08.400 --> 1:15:12.920]  Jones threatens Trump supporters so they can make threats to you they can call
[1:15:12.920 --> 1:15:17.040]  their supporters out to punish you for your political beliefs try to post
[1:15:17.040 --> 1:15:21.360]  evidence of that and YouTube will take it down I don't know if YouTube is calling
[1:15:21.360 --> 1:15:24.400]  the Democratic Party a violent criminal organization but I think that would be
[1:15:24.400 --> 1:15:27.240]  giving them too much credit I don't think they're aware enough to understand
[1:15:27.240 --> 1:15:31.600]  that that's exactly what they are I think they just use any excuse at hand to
[1:15:31.600 --> 1:15:35.800]  destroy any messages that go counter to the narrative the false narrative that
[1:15:35.800 --> 1:15:39.800]  they're trying to portray so we're entering into very dangerous uncharted
[1:15:39.800 --> 1:15:43.320]  waters as a nation and as a world especially as a nation here in the
[1:15:43.320 --> 1:15:47.120]  United States I don't know if we've ever I mean even during the Civil War weren't
[1:15:47.120 --> 1:15:51.240]  people a little bit smarter than this were there really these types of open
[1:15:51.240 --> 1:15:55.520]  threats to imprison the sitting president Trump if he knows what's good
[1:15:55.520 --> 1:16:00.080]  for him he'll never leave that office cognitive dissonance is a major issue
[1:16:00.080 --> 1:16:04.920]  amongst the left it can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to
[1:16:04.920 --> 1:16:09.360]  accept if you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental

[1:16:14.200 --> 1:16:19.440]  studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly

[1:16:23.880 --> 1:16:28.920]  rate of plaque and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses and
[1:16:28.920 --> 1:16:34.720]  joints and the digestive system recent studies have suggested that high EPA and
[1:16:34.720 --> 1:16:40.200]  DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration

[1:17:02.520 --> 1:17:07.160]  somewhere once terrorism is the threat of force or actually carrying out force
[1:17:07.160 --> 1:17:13.160]  for a political or financial reason it's basically scaring the hell out of
[1:17:13.160 --> 1:17:18.000]  people until you submit to them that's exactly what all this overblown COVID-19
[1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:22.600]  garbage is you see the headlines from CNN ABC News doctors say it's worse than
[1:17:22.600 --> 1:17:28.200]  they ever thought COVID more devastating than ever imagine they told us that two
[1:17:28.200 --> 1:17:32.640]  and a half million people would be dead just eight months ago within three months
[1:17:32.640 --> 1:17:37.320]  okay it's a quarter million if you count all of the people that died of other
[1:17:37.320 --> 1:17:41.720]  things we're talking 96% had comorbidity these are real numbers these are real
[1:17:41.720 --> 1:17:46.120]  facts this is the chicken little event we all run our houses never come out

[1:20:05.160 --> 1:20:17.920]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop
[1:20:17.920 --> 1:20:26.440]  tyranny well so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones
[1:20:26.440 --> 1:20:32.000]  Here's the Smith sitting in for Alex Jones as he's in Washington DC spearheading
[1:20:32.000 --> 1:20:36.640]  the movement and the March quite literally spearheading the March to save
[1:20:36.640 --> 1:20:43.160]  this Republic truly heroic stuff going on across the nation right now very very
[1:20:43.160 --> 1:20:46.400]  honored to be sitting in this chair and sharing this news with you of course the
[1:20:46.400 --> 1:20:50.480]  main story of the day the big story of the day is these leaked files exposing
[1:20:50.480 --> 1:20:54.200]  mass infiltration of firms all over the world by the Chinese Communist Party and
[1:20:54.200 --> 1:20:59.040]  we'll get to that we're taking a meandering path here because as I
[1:20:59.040 --> 1:21:02.560]  said in the last segment all of these different topics all these different
[1:21:02.560 --> 1:21:07.560]  categories are all very intricately intertwined so of course we start with
[1:21:07.560 --> 1:21:12.280]  the idea that Joe Biden is actually the president elect well he's not those
[1:21:12.280 --> 1:21:16.360]  votes will be cast actually tomorrow the 14th of December will be when the
[1:21:16.360 --> 1:21:20.800]  electoral votes are actually cast but it's not till the 6th of January that
[1:21:20.800 --> 1:21:24.640]  those are counted in the meantime there are multiple court cases including that
[1:21:24.640 --> 1:21:28.400]  Texas Supreme Court case being refiled there's a movement that could be made
[1:21:28.400 --> 1:21:32.680]  with Mike Pence as vice president choosing to throw out contested votes
[1:21:32.680 --> 1:21:37.840]  there's lots of paths to victory yet available including and the sort of
[1:21:37.840 --> 1:21:44.080]  last resort path the the polling the pin on the grenade path of martial law
[1:21:44.080 --> 1:21:53.080]  which at the you know greatest the greatest reaches is necessary and
[1:21:53.080 --> 1:21:56.800]  hopefully doesn't get to that pray to God that it doesn't actually have to come
[1:21:56.800 --> 1:22:01.360]  to that that some of these Republicans some of the state houses realize what's
[1:22:01.360 --> 1:22:04.360]  happening realize the danger that they're in that the country is literally on
[1:22:04.360 --> 1:22:08.320]  the verge of total destruction they actually look at what Joe Biden is
[1:22:08.320 --> 1:22:11.800]  planning on doing once he's in office and hopefully they'll put a stop to the
[1:22:11.800 --> 1:22:15.960]  blatant and outrageous theft of the election that we've seen go on even
[1:22:15.960 --> 1:22:22.440]  before November 4th and the lead up to it that just innumerable number of
[1:22:22.440 --> 1:22:27.520]  stories coming out about mail-in balloting but if all of that fails
[1:22:27.520 --> 1:22:32.440]  then at least we have that final stopgap measure of martial law and
[1:22:32.440 --> 1:22:38.160]  hopefully we don't have to get there but frankly could be worse it could be
[1:22:38.160 --> 1:22:41.760]  worse we could be taken over by Chinese communists we could be completely
[1:22:41.760 --> 1:22:47.280]  usurped by globalist slave masters so martial law a little bit preferable to
[1:22:47.280 --> 1:22:53.160]  that in my personal opinion so we start with the contested election and we go
[1:22:53.160 --> 1:22:57.480]  on to see what Joe Biden is saying of course he wants unity by which he means
[1:22:57.480 --> 1:23:03.360]  subjugation he wants togetherness by which he means been the knee shut up
[1:23:03.360 --> 1:23:07.600]  and let us abuse you without speaking out too much and of course he posts
[1:23:07.600 --> 1:23:13.000]  pictures of his dogs tearing apart a Trump doll you have this Michigan
[1:23:13.000 --> 1:23:18.880]  lawmaker threatening the lives of Trump supporters and then you have somebody
[1:23:18.880 --> 1:23:22.120]  trying to post that on YouTube trying to make awareness of the fact that
[1:23:22.120 --> 1:23:26.400]  Democrats are complete hypocrites total liars and dangerously pushing us
[1:23:26.400 --> 1:23:31.480]  towards civil war as they refuse to behave in any sort of civilized manner
[1:23:31.480 --> 1:23:36.560]  whatsoever he tries to post this video this guy known on YouTube as grabby in
[1:23:36.560 --> 1:23:42.400]  a gradient and YouTube says no no no you can't put videos of Democrats
[1:23:42.400 --> 1:23:46.040]  threatening Trump supporters no no that's a violation of our terms of
[1:23:46.040 --> 1:23:51.080]  service yes yet another example of this big tech censorship another rather
[1:23:51.080 --> 1:23:56.360]  outrageous overreach of the big tech ability to silence everyone and anyone
[1:23:56.360 --> 1:24:01.960]  who opposes their insidious plans Twitter briefly limits users interact
[1:24:01.960 --> 1:24:06.440]  interacting with Trump tweets about stolen election so Trump came out and
[1:24:06.440 --> 1:24:11.040]  said he believes that the election was stolen from him and Twitter didn't let
[1:24:11.040 --> 1:24:15.760]  users like or retweet those assertions and you also really have to pay
[1:24:15.760 --> 1:24:19.680]  attention to this because anytime you see one of these little labels under one
[1:24:19.680 --> 1:24:25.560]  of Trump's tweets or anybody's tweet a lot of times it's under a tweet of an
[1:24:25.560 --> 1:24:32.280]  opinion and you have to understand that's what censorship is it's not just
[1:24:32.280 --> 1:24:34.920]  about there you go most corrupt election in US history the claim about
[1:24:34.920 --> 1:24:39.360]  election fraud is disputed see this is where their power levels are now right
[1:24:39.360 --> 1:24:42.560]  now they can put a little label on it they're scared to go any farther than
[1:24:42.560 --> 1:24:47.000]  that give them institutional power elect them into office and that same
[1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:51.560]  standard of fact-checking will be applied to your opinions this is what you
[1:24:51.560 --> 1:24:55.600]  need to understand has nothing to do with so-called fact-checking just like
[1:24:55.600 --> 1:24:59.920]  YouTube didn't remove that video because it showed violence you know
[1:24:59.920 --> 1:25:04.040]  criminalized organized violence it didn't show that but that was the excuse
[1:25:04.040 --> 1:25:08.560]  they used to bring it down and so when these people get the power that they
[1:25:08.560 --> 1:25:13.040]  want if they're allowed to achieve the heights of control that they are
[1:25:13.040 --> 1:25:17.520]  reaching for they will use that same standard so you have to understand this
[1:25:17.520 --> 1:25:21.800]  it won't matter if it's factual or not it will matter whether it serves them or
[1:25:21.800 --> 1:25:25.440]  not it can be your opinion they'll say that's false and they'll censor you for
[1:25:25.440 --> 1:25:28.240]  it right now they're doing it on Twitter but give them institutional power
[1:25:28.240 --> 1:25:31.720]  give them total control of the government give them what they want and
[1:25:31.720 --> 1:25:38.120]  they'll use that same standard to destroy every aspect of your speech so it's
[1:25:38.120 --> 1:25:42.840]  worth paying attention to YouTube's also removing videos about questioning
[1:25:42.840 --> 1:25:45.920]  Biden's election victory Google-owned video platform YouTube has announced
[1:25:45.920 --> 1:25:48.960]  plans to remove any content that questions Joe Biden's victory in the
[1:25:48.960 --> 1:25:53.040]  2020 US presidential election despite the fact that legal challenges involving
[1:25:53.040 --> 1:25:56.080]  multiple states continue YouTube also announced it will be promoting
[1:25:56.080 --> 1:26:00.880]  authoritative news sources such as NBC and CBS and video recommendations not new
[1:26:00.880 --> 1:26:04.520]  but definitely an escalation of their previous practices I think that's
[1:26:04.520 --> 1:26:09.440]  obvious but it's truly incredible and you know it it happened with Kyle Rittenhouse
[1:26:09.440 --> 1:26:12.800]  it happened with several other situations where you have arguments
[1:26:12.800 --> 1:26:16.320]  being made sometimes being made in front of the Senate sometimes being made in
[1:26:16.320 --> 1:26:21.120]  courthouses if you can make an argument in a court if you can make an argument
[1:26:21.120 --> 1:26:26.920]  in front of the Senate but that same argument gets deleted from major free
[1:26:26.920 --> 1:26:31.000]  speech platforms major platforms like YouTube and Twitter and Facebook they
[1:26:31.000 --> 1:26:35.480]  are superseding the American government and of course the people they adhere to
[1:26:35.480 --> 1:26:39.560]  the people they bow to are not elected they're not responsible to a public that
[1:26:39.560 --> 1:26:44.560]  they serve they're completely independent their ambitions are their own the
[1:26:44.560 --> 1:26:48.400]  reasons they do things are completely on their own and you don't have a say over
[1:26:48.400 --> 1:26:54.520]  that but they in many ways supersede the court supersede any sort of national
[1:26:54.520 --> 1:26:59.920]  safeguards that we have and so this brings us to sort of back around and
[1:26:59.920 --> 1:27:04.480]  again we're all we're sort of in a we're a big Venn diagram of the Biden election
[1:27:04.480 --> 1:27:09.160]  this year you know the Biden presidency the stolen election China big tech and
[1:27:09.160 --> 1:27:14.080]  we're here right in the middle you know it at the intersection of hypocrisy
[1:27:14.080 --> 1:27:19.120]  okay Biden transition quietly brings on Facebook and Google employees when the
[1:27:19.120 --> 1:27:22.040]  Biden transition team released the names of hundreds of personnel on November
[1:27:22.040 --> 1:27:26.080]  10th there were zero current Facebook or Google employees among them that's
[1:27:26.080 --> 1:27:30.400]  changed the transition web type website quietly added for Facebook and Google
[1:27:30.400 --> 1:27:36.000]  employees to his agency review team on or close to Thanksgiving Zayed Zayed a

[1:27:56.960 --> 1:28:01.200]  will serve on the DHS team Silicon Valley critics have pressured the incoming
[1:28:01.200 --> 1:28:05.800]  administration not to hire people with ties to the tech industry to the senior
[1:28:05.800 --> 1:28:08.800]  post particularly individuals associated with Facebook and Google which are
[1:28:08.800 --> 1:28:13.160]  feeding off which are fending off massive antitrust lawsuits long story
[1:28:13.160 --> 1:28:17.960]  short there is massive overlap between big tech and the incoming Biden
[1:28:17.960 --> 1:28:22.440]  administration the the administration and when I say things like incoming
[1:28:22.440 --> 1:28:26.040]  Biden administration just know there's sarcastic quotes around that please put
[1:28:26.040 --> 1:28:31.280]  those in yourself add those in yourself massive overlap to the administration
[1:28:31.280 --> 1:28:37.120]  that they have censored to bring about which they have destroyed free speech
[1:28:37.120 --> 1:28:41.120]  to bring about that they have covered up stories to bring about this supposed
[1:28:41.120 --> 1:28:45.320]  Biden administration and now they're being rewarded now the crossover is
[1:28:45.320 --> 1:28:48.400]  becoming more obvious now they think they've won so they're coming out in the
[1:28:48.400 --> 1:28:51.160]  open and saying we're doing this and there's nothing you can do to stop it
[1:28:51.160 --> 1:28:57.560]  and it gets far far more deep than that and yes it does connect to China the
[1:28:57.560 --> 1:29:01.720]  pope came out yesterday and announced a global government corporate alliance to
[1:29:01.720 --> 1:29:06.200]  redistribute wealth create a planetary universal income which of course the

[1:29:39.800 --> 1:29:43.920]  must start valuing human life again we must start saying that we are not
[1:29:43.920 --> 1:29:49.640]  expendable that we are not disposable that we are essential until we do that

[1:33:18.080 --> 1:33:22.640]  alex jones who is still in washington dc in the last segment I talked about some
[1:33:22.640 --> 1:33:28.920]  of the newly revealed big tech insiders that will now be a part of biden's team
[1:33:28.920 --> 1:33:33.640]  in the way that those were secretly sort of slipped in after the announcement was
[1:33:33.640 --> 1:33:37.640]  made of who would be in his transition team they then later sort of added just
[1:33:37.640 --> 1:33:42.000]  sort of slipped in these big tech insiders into this but of course we've
[1:33:42.000 --> 1:33:48.200]  known about this for a long time right bart.com from mid november according to
[1:33:48.200 --> 1:33:52.480]  financial times presidential contender biden has hired both Jessica Hertz a
[1:33:52.480 --> 1:33:57.360]  former associate general counsel at facebook Cynthia Hogan former apple vice
[1:33:57.360 --> 1:34:01.200]  president for government affairs to his transition team Eric Schmidt the former
[1:34:01.200 --> 1:34:04.840]  google chief executive has been a big fundraiser and is being talked about to
[1:34:04.840 --> 1:34:08.680]  lead a new technology industry task force in the White House so all of these
[1:34:08.680 --> 1:34:11.400]  people that are censoring you all of these people that are working hand in
[1:34:11.400 --> 1:34:14.880]  hand with communist china all of these people that are telling you it's
[1:34:14.880 --> 1:34:20.080]  literally a sin for you to have free speech tim cook and apple Eric Schmidt
[1:34:20.080 --> 1:34:24.320]  and google they're going to have official government positions under the
[1:34:24.320 --> 1:34:28.880]  biden campaign that they helped to bring about this is crony capitalism this is
[1:34:28.880 --> 1:34:33.360]  the mafia that is seeking to rule all of our lives another thing that was
[1:34:33.360 --> 1:34:37.640]  revealed yesterday facebook's fact checkings are just happens to be a
[1:34:37.640 --> 1:34:42.280]  Hillary Clinton fangirl as if we needed more evidence that facebook is biased
[1:34:42.280 --> 1:34:45.440]  against conservatives it appears that the person in charge of deciding which
[1:34:45.440 --> 1:34:49.440]  entities are allowed to be fact checkers for the social media site might not be as
[1:34:49.440 --> 1:34:53.920]  fair of an arbiter of content moderation as the company wants us to think oh you
[1:34:53.920 --> 1:34:59.640]  don't say oh geez what facebook being dishonest hi how dare you sir
[1:34:59.640 --> 1:35:03.400]  skynes australia reported that an outspoken twitter activist critical of
[1:35:03.400 --> 1:35:07.960]  donald trump who brags about being on team hillary clinton is the supposedly
[1:35:07.960 --> 1:35:11.920]  independent expert in charge of who can become a facebook fact checker the news
[1:35:11.920 --> 1:35:16.800]  outlet points out that international fact checking network certifier and
[1:35:16.800 --> 1:35:21.040]  american university school of communication professor margo suska or
[1:35:21.040 --> 1:35:27.240]  suska is unashamedly politically biased for but be but she was responsible for
[1:35:27.240 --> 1:35:32.840]  issuing nineteen fact check licenses or reviews for organizations to become fact
[1:35:32.840 --> 1:35:38.880]  checkers they include check your fact associated press decryptors lead stories
[1:35:38.880 --> 1:35:43.720]  media-wise and the dispatch suska's made appearances on news outlets
[1:35:43.720 --> 1:35:47.960]  criticizing president trump saying i've been on team hillary since oh wait in a
[1:35:47.960 --> 1:35:52.480]  conversation with russia today suska admitted that she has difficulty being
[1:35:52.480 --> 1:35:56.000]  objective about president trump she said quote it is hard for me to be an
[1:35:56.000 --> 1:36:00.600]  objective observer of the presidential administration for when years now they
[1:36:00.600 --> 1:36:04.640]  have continually tried to delegitimize and marginalize news reporters for doing
[1:36:04.640 --> 1:36:08.720]  their constitutionally protect protected jobs despite suska's obvious
[1:36:08.720 --> 1:36:12.800]  bias facebook has given her power to decide which organizations be allowed to
[1:36:12.800 --> 1:36:19.320]  moderate content on the site truly truly incredible she's like yes i'm a i'm an
[1:36:19.320 --> 1:36:24.080]  extreme partisan i think everything donald trump does is a does a major
[1:36:24.080 --> 1:36:28.160]  threat to democracy oh okay go ahead and put her in charge of who's allowed to
[1:36:28.160 --> 1:36:32.160]  say things on facebook that's fantastic youtube facebook they're all the same
[1:36:32.160 --> 1:36:35.240]  youtube deletes comments critical of chinese communist party and this was
[1:36:35.240 --> 1:36:39.040]  actually sort of a scandal a little while ago but it's a resurfaced youtube
[1:36:39.040 --> 1:36:42.400]  has been deleting comments critical of china's ruling party do they do a
[1:36:42.400 --> 1:36:46.720]  software flaw just another little flaw another little glitch i actually was
[1:36:46.720 --> 1:36:51.160]  going to mention this earlier when i do put together my year in review i want
[1:36:51.160 --> 1:36:55.600]  you to take a shot every time a glitch goes in the favor of the democrats you'll
[1:36:55.600 --> 1:37:01.640]  be drunk by february all right every glitch every software malfunction every
[1:37:01.640 --> 1:37:07.080]  accident that happens in big tech or election engineering or just anything
[1:37:07.080 --> 1:37:12.840]  ever every accident every oopsie daisy is in one direction it favors the
[1:37:12.840 --> 1:37:18.000]  democrats god man they must think we're really dumb don't they they really think
[1:37:18.000 --> 1:37:22.680]  we're so stupid that they can just go up a oopsie day every time they're caught
[1:37:22.680 --> 1:37:26.160]  every single time they're caught they're like i turns out it was a glitch just
[1:37:26.160 --> 1:37:30.320]  another one of those glitches gosh darn it and it's been going on the entire year
[1:37:30.320 --> 1:37:36.280]  so yes it was it was a software flaw the company said on tuesday in response to
[1:37:36.280 --> 1:37:39.120]  criticism of the practice the spokesperson said the issue was not the
[1:37:39.120 --> 1:37:42.960]  result of a policy change some comments posted in in the chinese language such
[1:37:42.960 --> 1:37:47.120]  as communist bandit or fifty cent party a derogatory term for the ruling party
[1:37:47.120 --> 1:37:51.120]  were deleted within seconds youtube's automatic filters eliminate contents
[1:37:51.120 --> 1:37:56.600]  that violate company policies very very interesting just yet another one of
[1:37:56.600 --> 1:38:01.360]  these little glitches course youtube there was their speculation that is that
[1:38:01.360 --> 1:38:05.520]  there was outside influence that somebody was maybe taking advantage of the way
[1:38:05.520 --> 1:38:09.200]  youtube was set up maybe you had ten thousand chinese people in a bot farm
[1:38:09.200 --> 1:38:14.320]  somewhere who were just you know automatically tagging anything that came
[1:38:14.320 --> 1:38:17.920]  up but no no no youtube is clarified it did not happen from any sort of outside
[1:38:17.920 --> 1:38:24.920]  force they say it was caused by internal activity okay yeah of course they say it
[1:38:24.920 --> 1:38:29.760]  was an accident oopsie daisy sorry are bad although youtube comments today offer
[1:38:29.760 --> 1:38:33.280]  more detail than previously supplied they leave important questions unanswered
[1:38:33.280 --> 1:38:36.640]  how exactly did this error into the system and why did it go unnoticed for
[1:38:36.640 --> 1:38:40.240]  months these aren't trival trivial issues as youtube's lack of proper
[1:38:40.240 --> 1:38:44.200]  explanation has enabled political figures to accuse the company of bias towards
[1:38:44.200 --> 1:38:48.600]  the CCP yeah that's the problem the problem is that people are pointing out
[1:38:48.600 --> 1:38:53.280]  that they have a bias for the CCP yeah it's a real big issue when youtube is
[1:38:53.280 --> 1:38:57.520]  deleting comments that are critical of the chinese communist party who keep
[1:38:57.520 --> 1:39:02.600]  Uyghurs and slave camps who enslaved their own people in work camps for apple
[1:39:02.600 --> 1:39:07.720]  and Nike and others that's a real big problem when that's revealed when it's
[1:39:07.720 --> 1:39:12.160]  revealed that China is censoring people who are against that sort of thing from
[1:39:12.160 --> 1:39:16.920]  the Geller report maybe this explains at all youtube employs Chinese communist
[1:39:16.920 --> 1:39:22.440]  state secrecy bureau software engineers a host of software engineers for the
[1:39:22.440 --> 1:39:26.720]  platform youtube have formally worked for the Chinese Communist Party run
[1:39:26.720 --> 1:39:30.880]  institutions raising the question as to why a revolving door exists between
[1:39:30.880 --> 1:39:34.640]  youtube and the China based universities the software engineer for the video
[1:39:34.640 --> 1:39:39.840]  platform previously worked as a project manager for Guangzhou Xian technology
[1:39:39.840 --> 1:39:44.280]  detailing he detailed work for the China based firm as well as playing a major
[1:39:44.280 --> 1:39:50.160]  role in successful PLA certification of a terminal by ministry of public
[1:39:50.160 --> 1:39:54.920]  security states secrecy bureau and IT evaluation center in other words this
[1:39:54.920 --> 1:40:00.520]  guy this this youtube engineer led software efforts on behalf of the PLA
[1:40:00.520 --> 1:40:03.880]  appearing to reference the China's People Liberation Army the communist army
[1:40:03.880 --> 1:40:08.480]  and a host of Chinese government-led intelligence bodies what's more he
[1:40:08.480 --> 1:40:12.800]  notes he quote garnered a numerous garnered numerous staff awards for
[1:40:12.800 --> 1:40:19.400]  excellent performance he's not the only one it goes on to list employee after
[1:40:19.400 --> 1:40:24.040]  employee working at youtube since February 2014 despite previously working
[1:40:24.040 --> 1:40:28.160]  as a developer for Beijing based Peking University Peking University which has
[1:40:28.160 --> 1:40:32.000]  seen its researchers sentenced by the FBI for stealing intellectual property and
[1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:35.640]  failing to disclose Chinese Communist Party ties it's funded and controlled by
[1:40:35.640 --> 1:40:40.600]  Chinese Communist Party fan Yang another YouTube software engineer since April
[1:40:40.600 --> 1:40:44.760]  2017 interned for China telecom labeled by the US Department of Defense as
[1:40:44.760 --> 1:40:49.560]  collaborating with the Chinese military for over two decades so as this article
[1:40:49.560 --> 1:40:53.320]  puts it apparently there's a revolving door between the Chinese Communist Party
[1:40:53.320 --> 1:40:58.160]  or the Chinese Communist Army the People Liberation's Army of China revolving
[1:40:58.160 --> 1:41:03.320]  door between them and big tech there's also a revolving door between Joe Biden's
[1:41:03.320 --> 1:41:07.720]  administration and big tech it's all one revolving door it's not a door it's one
[1:41:07.720 --> 1:41:14.000]  big building and they all live in it there is no door that leads us of course
[1:41:14.000 --> 1:41:18.600]  to the biggest story of the day which is this leaked files exposed mass
[1:41:18.600 --> 1:41:25.440]  infiltration of UK firms by the China Chinese Communist Party Party insiders
[1:41:25.440 --> 1:41:28.680]  in the ranks is the way the Australian puts it the Chinese Communist Party has
[1:41:28.680 --> 1:41:32.600]  infiltrated the Australian British and US consulates in Shanghai with a
[1:41:32.600 --> 1:41:36.800]  government rung run recruitment agency placing advisors into Western embassies
[1:41:36.800 --> 1:41:43.040]  for more than a decade foreign affairs experts warn the employment of China
[1:41:43.040 --> 1:41:47.560]  Communist Party members in the consulate some for up to 16 years could be a part
[1:41:47.560 --> 1:41:50.680]  of a state-sponsored spiring while intelligence officers labeled it a
[1:41:50.680 --> 1:41:54.720]  breach of protocol and a risk to national security that base has also
[1:41:54.720 --> 1:41:58.720]  revealed that CCP members working in global companies such as Boeing which
[1:41:58.720 --> 1:42:03.320]  has had billions of dollars in defense contracts and inside Pfizer and
[1:42:03.320 --> 1:42:06.920]  AstraZeneca pharmaceutical companies which are developing the coronavirus
[1:42:06.920 --> 1:42:14.200]  vaccines and at Western universities is it all becoming clear to you what power
[1:42:14.200 --> 1:42:20.920]  we're up against what the cabal looks like I mean it's it's truly incredible I
[1:42:20.920 --> 1:42:24.320]  I almost say unbelievable but it's perfectly believable isn't it we've
[1:42:24.320 --> 1:42:30.000]  had at least 16 years more like 40 years of people in our government who hate
[1:42:30.000 --> 1:42:34.040]  the American people and are seeking to sell us out at every opportunity so it's
[1:42:34.040 --> 1:42:37.440]  not that unbelievable that they would welcome in members of the Chinese
[1:42:37.440 --> 1:42:42.160]  Communist Party they would brush aside any red flags that this might put up
[1:42:42.160 --> 1:42:46.880]  leaked files expose mass infiltration of UK firms by Chinese Communist Party
[1:42:46.880 --> 1:42:52.840]  including AstraZeneca Rolls Royce HB HSBC and Jaguar Land Rover totally
[1:42:52.840 --> 1:42:58.840]  undetected for 16 years two million Chinese agents we are witnessing a
[1:42:58.840 --> 1:43:03.000]  perfect dichotomy of psychological warfare the United Nations the big
[1:43:03.000 --> 1:43:06.880]  corporations the globalist big tech and big farmer all pushing the cub is the
[1:43:06.880 --> 1:43:10.840]  most deadly thing in history even though statistically it's a very weak flu or
[1:43:10.840 --> 1:43:14.920]  cold but if you are deficient then you can actually die from it that's why I
[1:43:14.920 --> 1:43:19.560]  see somebody dying inside the nursing homes meanwhile all these top scientists
[1:43:19.560 --> 1:43:23.360]  and researchers and former Pfizer head medical officers have come out and said
[1:43:23.360 --> 1:43:28.200]  that the COVID-19 vaccine especially the mRNA ones are basically bioweapons
[1:43:28.200 --> 1:43:31.360]  that are super deadly and now they're having to resuscitate people that die
[1:43:31.360 --> 1:43:35.840]  basically when they take it just like newborn babies they give vaccines they
[1:43:35.840 --> 1:43:38.840]  have to resuscitate them all the time or a lot of times they just love to die and
[1:43:38.840 --> 1:43:43.240]  that's on the record it does that Guillain-Barre's narcolepsy cancer all
[1:43:43.240 --> 1:43:46.200]  these other diseases but they tell you safe and effective no one's getting hurt
[1:43:46.200 --> 1:43:50.360]  it's a conspiracy theory and then all the fine princess can kill you absolutely
[1:43:50.360 --> 1:43:53.600]  deadly so they run from something that isn't dangerous towards something that
[1:43:53.600 --> 1:43:58.280]  is incredibly dangerous because the media says it's safe they do it if you
[1:43:58.280 --> 1:44:02.880]  think 2020 has been an insane and dangerous year just wait until you see
[1:44:02.880 --> 1:44:08.160]  the year 2021 I'm Alex Jones I started in full wars but I couldn't have done any
[1:44:08.160 --> 1:44:12.960]  of this without you and now in full wars is more important than ever because the

[1:48:29.960 --> 1:48:35.160]  an increasingly slavish world so info wars store.com is how we do all of this
[1:48:35.160 --> 1:48:37.840]  and we're gonna we're gonna circle back like I said we were you know we're
[1:48:37.840 --> 1:48:42.880]  gonna we're gonna as we've meandered on through the stolen election to the
[1:48:42.880 --> 1:48:47.080]  violence being perpetrated to the big tech censoring that violence to big tech
[1:48:47.080 --> 1:48:51.640]  being in bed with the Chinese communists to it turns out everybody's in bed with
[1:48:51.640 --> 1:48:53.960]  the Chinese communists with this incredible leak the story from
[1:48:53.960 --> 1:48:58.840]  nationalfile.com Chinese virus Chinese vaccine CCP leak confirms Pfizer
[1:48:58.840 --> 1:49:07.880]  AstraZeneca employed 123 Communist Party members literally everywhere invading
[1:49:07.880 --> 1:49:13.360]  every aspect of our government and our corporate structure and of course this
[1:49:13.360 --> 1:49:16.800]  has gone on unopposed because the people that run things are globalist they
[1:49:16.800 --> 1:49:20.160]  frankly don't care which country is giving them money as long as it's lining
[1:49:20.160 --> 1:49:25.400]  their pockets. Exclusive US Treasury breached by hackers backed by foreign
[1:49:25.400 --> 1:49:28.760]  government sources a sophisticated hacking group backed by a foreign
[1:49:28.760 --> 1:49:32.000]  government stole information from the US Treasury Department and a US agency
[1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:35.200]  responsible for deciding policy around the internet and telecommunications
[1:49:35.200 --> 1:49:38.600]  according to people familiar with this matter that is all the information we
[1:49:38.600 --> 1:49:42.960]  have out of Reuters from a hack that occurred today would they don't tell us
[1:49:42.960 --> 1:49:46.080]  which foreign government it is but let's let's put all the pieces together
[1:49:46.080 --> 1:49:50.040]  shall we and speculate and it's probably the communist Chinese probably the
[1:49:50.040 --> 1:49:54.080]  communist Chinese probably not Russia I'm gonna come out and say probably not
[1:49:54.080 --> 1:49:57.640]  Russia okay and this is a lesson that we've had to learn over and over again
[1:49:57.640 --> 1:50:05.160]  for the last four years but lo and behold yet another confirmation of what we
[1:50:05.160 --> 1:50:09.000]  hear at Info Wars has been talking about forever Hunter Biden president
[1:50:09.000 --> 1:50:12.920]  elect son says federal prosecutors probing his taxes I want to I want to take
[1:50:12.920 --> 1:50:19.440]  a moment to really reflect on this headline and its subtitle here's the
[1:50:19.440 --> 1:50:24.640]  headline hunter Biden the president elect son says federal prosecutors are
[1:50:24.640 --> 1:50:30.000]  probing his taxes but here's the subtext the probe was revealed weeks after an
[1:50:30.000 --> 1:50:34.200]  election in which president Donald Trump and his allies made unfounded and
[1:50:34.200 --> 1:50:40.920]  baseless claims of corruption regarding hunter Biden and his father so if you're
[1:50:40.920 --> 1:50:46.240]  a normal person and you can read these two headlines and not have an aneurysm
[1:50:46.240 --> 1:50:52.040]  just from sheer cognitive dissidents I'm not sure my explanation will do any more
[1:50:52.040 --> 1:50:56.280]  to further your ability to think critically because this is so obvious
[1:50:56.280 --> 1:51:02.280]  it should be like a slap in the face right oh he is under investigation but
[1:51:02.280 --> 1:51:06.360]  the claims he was under investigation were unfounded that's it's literally what
[1:51:06.360 --> 1:51:11.760]  they're telling you you have to be dumb as a brick to untit to actually believe
[1:51:11.760 --> 1:51:17.640]  this to actually absorb this level of hypocrisy this level of just blatant
[1:51:17.640 --> 1:51:23.120]  obfuscation and not have some part of your brain set off an alarm that goes
[1:51:23.120 --> 1:51:26.760]  hey they're lying to you hey they're full of crap hey take everything they say
[1:51:26.760 --> 1:51:31.360]  with a grain of salt because they clearly are hiding something from you it's
[1:51:31.360 --> 1:51:35.680]  just incredible isn't it hunter Biden says federal prosecutors are probing his
[1:51:35.680 --> 1:51:39.160]  taxes this comes weeks after an election where Trump and his allies made
[1:51:39.160 --> 1:51:43.440]  unfounded and baseless claims of corruption unfounded and baseless
[1:51:43.440 --> 1:51:49.840]  claims that turned out to be well-founded and have a rocks rock solid base
[1:51:49.840 --> 1:51:53.720]  incredible hunter Biden president like Joe Biden son said Wednesday federal
[1:51:53.720 --> 1:51:57.680]  officials in Delaware are investigating his taxes this news came's weeks after
[1:51:57.680 --> 1:52:01.200]  an election campaign which president Donald Trump and his allies made unfounded
[1:52:01.200 --> 1:52:04.560]  baseless claims of credit they just repeated over and over they also alleged
[1:52:04.560 --> 1:52:07.160]  that hunter Biden used his father's influence to enrich himself through
[1:52:07.160 --> 1:52:10.920]  business deals in Ukraine and China and that his father not only facilitated
[1:52:10.920 --> 1:52:15.080]  that but may have benefited financially Trump provided no evidence of this
[1:52:15.080 --> 1:52:18.640]  claim like this is the this is the type of crap they say Trump provided no
[1:52:18.640 --> 1:52:25.000]  evidence for their claims so I mean they expect you to believe that Trump just
[1:52:25.000 --> 1:52:27.840]  just made something up out of thin air and this is what they always do they're
[1:52:27.840 --> 1:52:31.560]  always just like that no evidence no foundation they're just making up it's
[1:52:31.560 --> 1:52:36.000]  like we don't just sit here and make things up how dumb would that be to sit
[1:52:36.000 --> 1:52:41.480]  here and go gosh let's say I don't let's say hunter Biden international so I
[1:52:41.480 --> 1:52:43.520]  don't know let's just like throw something out there and let's just like
[1:52:43.520 --> 1:52:49.160]  lie about so like we don't do that we just don't do that what we had was the
[1:52:49.160 --> 1:52:55.000]  New York Post receiving a laptop that showed incontrovertible proof that this
[1:52:55.000 --> 1:52:59.760]  is what was happening and then we reported on that according to the NBC
[1:52:59.760 --> 1:53:04.920]  paper here Trump provided no evidence no evidence for the claim while he and his
[1:53:04.920 --> 1:53:09.600]  family remained under ethical scrutiny yeah they've been under scrutiny the
[1:53:09.600 --> 1:53:13.720]  entire time they've been in office and even beforehand and absolutely nothing
[1:53:13.720 --> 1:53:18.160]  has come of it because they're not crooked in the way that Biden and his
[1:53:18.160 --> 1:53:22.720]  family certainly are let's do some little little couple of little
[1:53:22.720 --> 1:53:28.200]  comparisons on this story shall we just in case again like the liberals your
[1:53:28.200 --> 1:53:33.520]  memory is that of a goldfish from Sam Stein evidence of a money
[1:53:33.520 --> 1:53:38.320]  laundering probe into hunter Biden was apparent in the markings on a series of
[1:53:38.320 --> 1:53:42.120]  documents that were made public but largely went unnoticed in the days
[1:53:42.120 --> 1:53:46.920]  leading up to the November election largely went unnoticed and then of
[1:53:46.920 --> 1:53:52.000]  course directly under that we have the New York Post headline Biden China deal
[1:53:52.000 --> 1:53:57.080]  business partner confirms hunter emails legit says he were he says he worked with
[1:53:57.080 --> 1:54:02.360]  big guy Joe and solicited millions from Chinese in 17 so they'll they'll take
[1:54:02.360 --> 1:54:05.040]  something that you have evidence for and they'll say it's baseless and you have
[1:54:05.040 --> 1:54:09.600]  no evidence you can publish that evidence in a major newspaper in fact the
[1:54:09.600 --> 1:54:13.800]  oldest newspaper in existence in America and they'll censor that they'll
[1:54:13.800 --> 1:54:18.360]  delete that Facebook literally came out and said we have no information to
[1:54:18.360 --> 1:54:22.360]  counter this claim but we're gonna censor it anyway add an overabundance of
[1:54:22.360 --> 1:54:25.760]  caution we're gonna go ahead and censor our political enemies it's for your
[1:54:25.760 --> 1:54:32.360]  safety trust us truly incredible went largely unnoticed so they'll censor that
[1:54:32.360 --> 1:54:36.600]  information and then later when they're forced to admit it they'll go oh it went
[1:54:36.600 --> 1:54:42.160]  largely unnoticed it went largely unnoticed yeah yeah yeah yeah the corpse
[1:54:42.160 --> 1:54:47.160]  you buried in the woods it went largely unnoticed the the trash you swept under
[1:54:47.160 --> 1:54:52.760]  the rug went largely unnoticed no you hid it from us you absolute scoundrels
[1:54:52.760 --> 1:54:57.240]  hunter-biden story is Russian this is so you announce we get political let's
[1:54:57.240 --> 1:55:02.120]  look at one particular outlet shall we here's the story recently hunter-biden
[1:55:02.120 --> 1:55:05.040]  story or no this is the old one I have these out of order but it's fine it
[1:55:05.040 --> 1:55:08.360]  works either way here's the old story hunter-biden story is Russian disinfo

[1:55:17.720 --> 1:55:20.640]  want to step farther and said no actually it's Russian disinformation
[1:55:20.640 --> 1:55:24.040]  that's right that's how dumb they think you are hunter-biden story is Russian

[1:57:04.160 --> 1:57:08.640]  under the rug and now that they've successfully captured the American
[1:57:08.640 --> 1:57:12.360]  election in their own estimation they've successfully captured the American
[1:57:12.360 --> 1:57:16.080]  election now they can come out and say gosh if only we'd known about this
[1:57:16.080 --> 1:57:21.000]  beforehand in the level of lies level of cognitive dissonance level of just
[1:57:21.000 --> 1:57:25.360]  absolute BS that we're being fed day after day it makes a hell of a lot of
[1:57:25.360 --> 1:57:30.800]  sense that every one of our institutions is currently under occupation by two
[1:57:30.800 --> 1:57:35.160]  million highly motivated Chinese communists doesn't really incredible
