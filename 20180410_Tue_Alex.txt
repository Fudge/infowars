[00:00:08.504 --> 00:00:13.351]  Broadcasting live from the UN Stronghold, Austin, Texas.
[00:00:13.351 --> 00:00:16.837]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:16.837 --> 00:00:19.641]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:00:26.894 --> 00:00:49.561]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones is in Washington, D.C., and he's been, well, super empowered today, not just during the press conference, but then concluding, we'll call it a man on the street just moments ago, where he compared a member of the Fake News to an animatronic rat from Chuck E. Cheese.
[00:00:49.561 --> 00:00:52.282]  You cannot make that stuff up.
[00:00:53.459 --> 00:01:01.385]  But, this morning he was addressing free speech, the attacks on the First Amendment, the attacks on the Second Amendment at the National Press Club in D.C.
[00:01:01.385 --> 00:01:10.552]  And it's amazing, while I'm listening to everybody speak, I'm reading this story from the Gateway Pundit.
[00:01:10.552 --> 00:01:19.038]  It begins, California Senator introduces bill to kill free speech, requires state-sanctioned fact-checkers to approve online content.
[00:01:22.836 --> 00:01:29.524]  It's amazing because you'll have people say, Oh, look at Alex Jones trying to get attention.
[00:01:29.524 --> 00:01:34.389]  Look at, look at Alex Jones trying to publicize and promote himself.
[00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:37.533]  Oh, oh yeah, Alex, the first amendment is under attack.
[00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:40.076]  Please, please.
[00:01:40.076 --> 00:01:42.058]  And then it's like,
[00:01:43.573 --> 00:01:56.389]  Okay, well here's the bill introduced in California that wants to have a state-sanctioned fact check of social media and online content.
[00:01:56.389 --> 00:02:00.294]  And you don't think for one second that's aimed at us?
[00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.801]  But that's just possibly down the road.
[00:02:05.801 --> 00:02:20.484]  What about all the censorship on Twitter, on YouTube, the banning of conservative channels, the removal of Diamond and Silk on Facebook because they're deemed unsafe for the community?
[00:02:20.484 --> 00:02:21.224]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:02:21.224 --> 00:02:25.945]  Unsafe for the community that they're trying to social engineer.
[00:02:25.945 --> 00:02:32.146]  There's the story at Infowars.com from John Rappaport, which is also cited in the Gateway Pundit story.
[00:02:33.635 --> 00:02:41.598]  So yeah, we're crazy for wanting to draw attention to the First Amendment being under attack.
[00:02:41.598 --> 00:03:01.765]  Yeah, we're nuts because in this country the First Amendment is one of the founding principles of free speech and it's under attack from a radical left-wing consortium of social media, government, and television news media
[00:03:03.738 --> 00:03:15.524]  All working together to demonize their opposition and then say you have to be removed because you're quote-unquote unsafe to the community.
[00:03:15.524 --> 00:03:24.948]  Yeah, it's not safe for the community that's being fed a bunch of lies to have reality smack them in the face.
[00:03:24.948 --> 00:03:26.229]  That's not safe for the community.
[00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:30.791]  You might be woken up from your coma.
[00:03:30.791 --> 00:03:31.932]  Your spirit might be
[00:03:33.667 --> 00:03:38.071]  Lit from its ashes.
[00:03:38.071 --> 00:03:59.509]  You might rise like the phoenix from your brainwashed stupor to being alive, spiritual, discerning, and that's unsafe to the community that Facebook, Twitter, Google are trying to create.
[00:04:01.704 --> 00:04:05.866]  So Alex Jones goes to the National Press Club, addresses all of this.
[00:04:05.866 --> 00:04:08.527]  We get attacked every day.
[00:04:08.527 --> 00:04:14.330]  We have people trying to handicap us and bring us down with frivolous lawsuits.
[00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:22.574]  So we're going to go to the clips on the other side of some of the speeches and some of the moments from Alex Jones at the National Press Club in D.C.
[00:04:22.574 --> 00:04:28.457]  today, addressing the attacks on Infowars, the attacks on the First Amendment, the attacks on the Second Amendment.
[00:04:31.209 --> 00:04:44.673]  And just as you would have suspected, on the streets of D.C., the liberal goons come out from the sewers that they dwell in to attack Alex Jones on the same nonsense that they always use.
[00:04:44.673 --> 00:04:46.654]  But now they've got a new one!
[00:04:46.654 --> 00:04:47.634]  Now they've got a new one.
[00:04:47.634 --> 00:04:51.276]  Oh, Alex Jones, you got sued by Georgetown.
[00:04:51.276 --> 00:04:52.736]  How does that feel?
[00:04:52.736 --> 00:04:55.837]  Well, it's going to feel pretty good when he wins the slapback lawsuit.
[00:04:55.837 --> 00:04:57.678]  So we're going to have all that on the other side.
[00:04:57.678 --> 00:04:58.198]  Don't go anywhere.
[00:05:00.433 --> 00:05:03.855]  Introducing CellForce by InfoWars Life.
[00:05:03.855 --> 00:05:07.817]  CellForce focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[00:05:07.817 --> 00:05:11.158]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[00:05:11.158 --> 00:05:13.700]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:18.062]  CellForce helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[00:05:18.422 --> 00:05:20.763]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul.
[00:05:20.763 --> 00:05:27.785]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[00:05:27.785 --> 00:05:34.968]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[00:05:35.968 --> 00:05:41.033]  The antioxidants found in CellForce are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[00:05:41.033 --> 00:05:48.679]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[00:05:48.679 --> 00:05:53.603]  Boost, protect, and adapt with CellForce from InfoWars Life.
[00:05:53.603 --> 00:05:56.526]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:06:05.649 --> 00:06:07.410]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:12.332]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:12.332 --> 00:06:13.933]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:06:21.258 --> 00:06:22.099]  Alex Jones!
[00:06:41.849 --> 00:06:44.091]  I speak to you as an immigrant myself.
[00:06:44.091 --> 00:06:48.896]  I came to this country 45 years ago with me and my mother, okay?
[00:06:48.896 --> 00:06:51.378]  45 years ago, we were not offered sanctuary.
[00:06:51.378 --> 00:06:54.401]  We were not offered an easier, softer way, okay?
[00:06:54.401 --> 00:06:58.164]  We were told, you have to be an American citizen and here's what you have to do.
[00:06:58.164 --> 00:06:58.745]  And we did it.
[00:06:59.145 --> 00:07:02.266]  We worked hard and we put in our time, okay?
[00:07:02.266 --> 00:07:11.530]  And I now have a piece of paper hanging on my wall called a naturalization certificate that says I am a proud United States American citizen.
[00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:16.572]  And if I can do it, every single person that's a dreamer in this room can do it.
[00:07:16.572 --> 00:07:20.794]  Every person that's undocumented in this room, they could do it too.
[00:07:20.794 --> 00:07:22.995]  So we had very, very weak laws.
[00:07:22.995 --> 00:07:24.475]  We have the worst laws.
[00:07:24.475 --> 00:07:25.876]  You have a catch and release.
[00:07:26.596 --> 00:07:28.818]  Which we're terminating very quickly.
[00:07:28.818 --> 00:07:33.682]  We're doing it in pieces.
[00:07:33.682 --> 00:07:34.622]  No, it's unbelievable.
[00:07:34.622 --> 00:07:35.883]  Think of this.
[00:07:35.883 --> 00:07:46.051]  So we have a country where if they step one foot, not two feet, if one foot hits our country, we have to take those people, gently register them,
[00:07:47.529 --> 00:07:48.929]  And then release them, okay?
[00:07:48.929 --> 00:07:51.010]  We're gonna release them, essentially, in a short period of time.
[00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:52.490]  So we release them.
[00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:55.330]  And then they're supposed to come back for a court case.
[00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.131]  We hire more judges.
[00:07:57.131 --> 00:08:00.731]  We're trying to hire thousands of judges.
[00:08:00.731 --> 00:08:02.092]  No other country in the world does it.
[00:08:02.092 --> 00:08:06.372]  We hire judges so that these people will come back.
[00:08:06.372 --> 00:08:08.313]  Now, they're on the land.
[00:08:08.313 --> 00:08:09.313]  We release them.
[00:08:09.313 --> 00:08:12.013]  They go someplace into our country.
[00:08:12.013 --> 00:08:14.754]  They're supposed to come back within two or three years for a court case.
[00:08:16.513 --> 00:08:18.814]  But nobody ever comes back!
[00:08:18.814 --> 00:08:24.937]  President Trump signed a proclamation on Wednesday to send up to 4,000 National Guard members to the border.
[00:08:24.937 --> 00:08:40.305]  Meanwhile, the first of the left-leaning governors refusing to support President Trump rears up, declaring as the Daily Mail reports, Oregon Governor Kate Brown tweeted, If Donald Trump asks me to deploy Oregon Guard troops to the Mexico border, I'll say no.
[00:08:40.305 --> 00:08:45.568]  As commander of Oregon's Guard, I'm deeply troubled by Trump's plan to militarize our border.
[00:08:45.788 --> 00:08:48.510]  But President Trump is hardly backing down.
[00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:52.872]  When Trump says enough is enough, consider this, as Breitbart reported.
[00:08:52.872 --> 00:08:59.696]  Border Patrol agents arrested eight Bangladesh nationals in the Laredo sector during a two-day period last week.
[00:08:59.696 --> 00:09:06.139]  During the month of March, Laredo sector agents arrested at least 24 after they illegally crossed from Mexico.
[00:09:06.139 --> 00:09:10.822]  The Laredo sector leads the nation in arrests of Bangladeshis who enter the U.S.
[00:09:10.822 --> 00:09:12.323]  illegally in South Texas.
[00:09:12.583 --> 00:09:22.947]  Border Patrol Agent Hector Garza said the arrest of these people from Bangladesh shows there is a clear pipeline from anywhere in the world to Mexico and on to the southern border of Texas.
[00:09:22.947 --> 00:09:28.509]  What percentage are you seeing from places other than South and Central America?
[00:09:28.509 --> 00:09:40.273]  The Border Patrol and Homeland Security categorize the people that are not from Mexico as other than Mexicans and prior to last night, it was running about 73%
[00:09:42.334 --> 00:09:47.477]  of the people apprehended in the Rio Grande Valley or OTMs other than Mexican.
[00:09:47.477 --> 00:09:52.459]  As one of them was climbing over the fence, he dropped a package.
[00:09:53.906 --> 00:09:57.089]  And that package was an Urdu dictionary.
[00:09:57.089 --> 00:10:02.214]  Urdu is a language spoken in Pakistan and Afghanistan.
[00:10:02.214 --> 00:10:11.042]  And in that translation book, Urdu and English, there were a lot of phrases circled and outlined.
[00:10:11.042 --> 00:10:12.864]  Do you speak Spanish?
[00:10:12.864 --> 00:10:14.626]  Do you speak English?
[00:10:14.626 --> 00:10:15.867]  You must pay in dollars.
[00:10:17.034 --> 00:10:43.204]  So we know that special interest countries in particular countries like Pakistan or Afghanistan that are not particularly friendly with our country are slipping through here under the disguise of and under the all this other activity that's going on where these families are given up and and the border patrol resources are being compromised so it's it's easier for them to slip through this private property
[00:10:43.824 --> 00:10:45.366]  And that's just one example.
[00:10:45.366 --> 00:10:52.054]  And more recently, within the past two weeks, some Iranian money was found in a bailout vehicle.
[00:10:52.054 --> 00:10:54.317]  So, we know they're coming in here.
[00:10:54.317 --> 00:10:56.940]  And as Joe Ginkowski reports, U.S.
[00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:03.808]  Border Patrol has arrested sex criminals in the days leading up to Trump's decision to send National Guard troops to the southern border.
[00:11:04.048 --> 00:11:05.910]  So far in the month of April, the U.S.
[00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:13.637]  Customs and Border Protection has had its hands full with detaining sex offenders who had sought to enter the country at the U.S.-Mexican border.
[00:11:13.637 --> 00:11:20.323]  According to the CBP, Southwest border apprehensions and inadmissible entries increased 37% in March over February.
[00:11:20.323 --> 00:11:21.784]  Compared to March 2017, March 2018 numbers were 230,000.
[00:11:26.929 --> 00:11:31.132]  The National Guard will just be the beginning when it comes to finally securing our borders.
[00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:59.415]  So there's the InfoWars footage of us walking across the border carrying a severed head.
[00:11:59.415 --> 00:12:01.316]  No Border Patrol there to stop us.
[00:12:01.316 --> 00:12:05.239]  James O'Keefe walks across the border dressed like Osama Bin Laden.
[00:12:05.239 --> 00:12:07.821]  No Border Patrol there to stop him.
[00:12:07.821 --> 00:12:09.502]  So that's not a problem.
[00:12:09.502 --> 00:12:11.963]  And then you've got Texas sending
[00:12:12.924 --> 00:12:14.965]  Fourteen hundred troops to the border.
[00:12:14.965 --> 00:12:20.608]  You've got the military ramping up their technology of how they're going to handle border security.
[00:12:20.608 --> 00:12:23.329]  But the caravanners are still saying, oh, we're still coming.
[00:12:23.329 --> 00:12:25.530]  You can't stop us.
[00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:28.112]  And so that's what we're dealing with down there.
[00:12:28.112 --> 00:12:30.793]  And the Democrats want nothing to do with fixing that problem.
[00:12:30.793 --> 00:12:32.934]  But we've got Alex in D.C.
[00:12:32.934 --> 00:12:33.875]  right now.
[00:12:33.875 --> 00:12:35.996]  Alex Jones invades the swamp.
[00:12:35.996 --> 00:12:37.196]  Millie Weaver was there as well.
[00:12:37.196 --> 00:12:41.498]  She gave a brief speech during the address at the National Press Club.
[00:12:41.498 --> 00:12:42.359]  Here is that speech.
[00:12:43.035 --> 00:12:44.976]  Hi, I'm Millie Weaver.
[00:12:44.976 --> 00:13:11.276]  I'm a reporter for InfoWars and the reason I brought this microphone up here to show you guys is there have been so many times that I've been accosted, spit at, had urine thrown on me by rogue people, especially Antifa groups, radical communist leftist groups, because of the lies and propaganda that the mainstream media spews about InfoWars and Alex Jones.
[00:13:11.276 --> 00:13:12.377]  So I get attacked
[00:13:12.717 --> 00:13:15.059]  Because of these lies, physically attacked.
[00:13:15.059 --> 00:13:23.964]  Now, a lot of this lawsuit that's been put against Alex Jones and InfoWars surrounds Charlottesville.
[00:13:23.964 --> 00:13:26.066]  I was there in Charlottesville.
[00:13:26.066 --> 00:13:30.909]  I was the InfoWars reporter on the ground reporting to you guys what happened.
[00:13:30.909 --> 00:13:35.432]  We all know that the mainstream media afterward decided to spin a bias
[00:13:38.113 --> 00:13:48.060]  One-sided storyline that you had a bunch of rogue KKK extremists come and attack a bunch of peaceful protesters out there.
[00:13:48.060 --> 00:14:02.510]  What I can tell you is that because I had the ability to live stream and to broadcast on social media, which those broadcasts went viral, I was able to show what exactly actually happened out there in Charlottesville.
[00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:04.091]  The truth spoke for itself.
[00:14:05.177 --> 00:14:07.978]  Okay, there was violence on both sides.
[00:14:07.978 --> 00:14:17.923]  But I will say the overwhelming majority of the violence was coming from the Antifa leftist anti-protesters.
[00:14:17.923 --> 00:14:23.366]  The ones protesting people who were out there trying to stand up for protecting a statue.
[00:14:23.366 --> 00:14:26.568]  And yes, there were rogue elements on both sides.
[00:14:26.568 --> 00:14:30.850]  But one side came with pepper spray, tear gas canisters.
[00:14:32.564 --> 00:14:38.608]  Ice chest full of water balloons with chemicals and urine and feces in them to throw.
[00:14:38.608 --> 00:14:50.358]  And that was depicted and caught through my ability to live stream broadcasts on Facebook, on YouTube, on these social media sites that they want to remove us from.
[00:14:50.358 --> 00:14:52.600]  I got the truth out there with Charlotte's film.
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:15:01.029]  While at the same time, myself and my cameraman especially were pepper sprayed in the face for being InfoWars.
[00:15:01.029 --> 00:15:11.742]  I made it clear to both Antifa and some of the radical elements on the alternative right side that we did not agree with any of their positions.
[00:15:12.102 --> 00:15:13.863]  We do not agree with communism.
[00:15:13.863 --> 00:15:15.744]  We do not agree with fascism.
[00:15:15.744 --> 00:15:19.987]  But what I told them was, I do agree with your right to free speech.
[00:15:19.987 --> 00:15:24.249]  Both of you guys have a right to be out here and peacefully protest.
[00:15:24.249 --> 00:15:32.214]  That didn't stop us from being pepper sprayed and attacked because of the lies and the propaganda that the mainstream media spreads about us and InfoWars.
[00:15:32.214 --> 00:15:35.016]  That's why it's so important that we protect
[00:15:35.596 --> 00:15:51.265]  Free press, guerrilla journalists, all of us out here today who are in this room should understand and know the importance of our ability to go out there and tell the truth when sometimes the moral integrity of mainstream media is lapsed.
[00:15:51.265 --> 00:15:52.366]  Thank you very much.
[00:15:52.366 --> 00:15:56.368]  Alright, more from Alex Jones invades the swamp on the other side.
[00:15:56.368 --> 00:15:57.089]  Don't go anywhere.
[00:15:59.676 --> 00:16:01.638]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:16:01.638 --> 00:16:06.962]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.

[00:19:04.632 --> 00:19:05.473]  Devon in Florida.
[00:19:05.473 --> 00:19:05.874]  You're on the air.
[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:07.300]  Great!
[00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:08.422]  Hey, thank you so much.
[00:19:08.422 --> 00:19:12.966]  Listen, I have bought your products, and I gotta say, they're amazing.
[00:19:12.966 --> 00:19:23.115]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it, because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret Swell, 5mm Fusion, I've got the Body Armor... Wow, thank you.

[00:19:25.397 --> 00:19:27.039]  Which Nutra-Certical does you like best?
[00:19:27.279 --> 00:19:30.762]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, to be honest.
[00:19:30.762 --> 00:19:31.263]  That's amazing.
[00:19:31.263 --> 00:19:32.024]  That's really incredible.
[00:19:32.024 --> 00:19:35.087]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[00:19:35.087 --> 00:19:36.448]  Like, I haven't felt this week.
[00:19:36.448 --> 00:19:38.089]  My morning was fantastic.
[00:19:38.089 --> 00:19:39.250]  And I love the guys.
[00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:41.513]  I love the Info Wars crew.
[00:19:41.513 --> 00:19:48.359]  And I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[00:19:48.359 --> 00:19:49.400]  You will love it.

[00:20:03.386 --> 00:20:06.027]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:16.591 --> 00:20:18.694]  Alex Jones Invades the Swamp.
[00:20:18.694 --> 00:20:20.457]  It was live this morning.
[00:20:20.457 --> 00:20:23.882]  We've got many clips coming for you today on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:23.882 --> 00:20:27.547]  Let's now go to Alex's lawyers question and answer session.
[00:20:29.448 --> 00:20:30.568]  Hi, my name is Suzanne Monk.
[00:20:30.568 --> 00:20:32.929]  I'm host of Trump Talk US.
[00:20:32.929 --> 00:20:35.310]  I want to thank you, first of all, for doing this.
[00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:44.413]  My question to my viewers is, is there any class action lawsuits that are being put against the banners, against the people who are censoring us?
[00:20:44.413 --> 00:20:48.494]  This is one of our bravest concerns, that we find a way to actually be able to fight back.
[00:20:48.494 --> 00:20:49.595]  They're suing us.
[00:20:49.595 --> 00:20:50.635]  Is there any way we can sue them?
[00:20:51.428 --> 00:21:06.560]  Well, you know, I think as this lawsuit illustrates, so many states have these anti-slap statutes that allow somebody who's being victimized by an abusive lawsuit to push back and say, you don't get to go to the courts to take action against people just because you disagree with their protected speech.
[00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:08.861]  Counselor, what confidence do you have in the courts
[00:21:34.462 --> 00:21:51.298]  I raise that question, my name is Cliff Kincaid with America's Survival TV because we just reported on a group of Obama judges in the Fourth Circuit ruling that a war memorial in Bladensburg, Maryland has to be destroyed.
[00:21:51.298 --> 00:21:56.803]  It's been sitting for a hundred years because it includes a Christian cross.
[00:21:56.803 --> 00:21:58.905]  This is what the courts are about now.
[00:21:59.585 --> 00:22:01.586]  You know it, I know it.
[00:22:01.586 --> 00:22:14.274]  So what confidence do you have in the courts that they're going to rule on the basis of law and the Constitution and not rule against you and Alex Jones because they don't like you?
[00:22:15.259 --> 00:22:18.541]  You know, our federal courts are, it's a wonderful court system.
[00:22:18.541 --> 00:22:20.283]  There are some bad eggs here and there.
[00:22:20.283 --> 00:22:23.385]  There are judges who sometimes issue questionable rulings.
[00:22:23.385 --> 00:22:25.827]  But at the same time, it's a system that works pretty well.
[00:22:25.827 --> 00:22:27.948]  There's a lot of variation between the states.
[00:22:27.948 --> 00:22:32.351]  But I think overall, at this point with our constitutional rights, you generally get a fair shake.
[00:22:32.351 --> 00:22:33.412]  Not always, but generally.
[00:22:35.701 --> 00:22:38.765]  Mr. Grossman, Jason Goodman from Crowdsource the Truth.
[00:22:38.765 --> 00:22:52.200]  The same individual who spoke to Alex about Martian slave children has brought a lawsuit against Crowdsource the Truth after we introduced evidence that he's engaged in felony charity fraud.
[00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:58.681]  Is there any way that I can bring that to the attention of authorities and have him brought up on criminal charges?
[00:22:58.681 --> 00:23:07.523]  Not as a punitive step against the lawsuit, but it seems like the lawsuit is an effort on his part to suppress that information and silence me.
[00:23:07.523 --> 00:23:11.424]  I can't really comment on that because I'm not familiar with the facts of the matter.
[00:23:11.424 --> 00:23:15.365]  Obviously, if you have an attorney representing you in your lawsuit, you should probably speak with them about that.
[00:23:16.105 --> 00:23:21.768]  Well, and of course, as you've stated, that's his goal, the punitive measures of the financial damage something like that would cause.
[00:23:21.768 --> 00:23:24.910]  But thank you for your answer.
[00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:26.751]  So a lot is going on.
[00:23:26.751 --> 00:23:30.733]  My name is Cherie Saber, Mom's for Trump.
[00:23:30.733 --> 00:23:37.958]  It appears to me, Mr. Jones and everyone here, there will be a lot of lawsuits going forward.
[00:23:37.958 --> 00:23:42.940]  This is a very interesting time that we're living in, as we all know.
[00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:43.461]  The question
[00:23:44.588 --> 00:23:52.475]  With all the lawsuits that are going on, and that will be going on, my question is, countersuit.
[00:23:52.475 --> 00:23:53.575]  Is there such a thing?
[00:23:53.575 --> 00:23:55.057]  Simply, countersuit.
[00:23:55.057 --> 00:23:58.219]  Can people countersuit?
[00:23:58.219 --> 00:24:03.764]  Well, this is exactly what we're talking about with this case and the anti-slap motion that we filed today.
[00:24:03.764 --> 00:24:08.548]  When somebody files one of these frivolous, abusive lawsuits merely to punish their political enemies,
[00:24:09.068 --> 00:24:19.155]  The way to respond to that in the states that allow it is to file an anti-slap motion to get that case dismissed and to sanction the other side for abusing the court system to punish their political enemies.
[00:24:19.155 --> 00:24:28.102]  That's the way I think over a period of time that you change the incentives for this kind of litigation so that people realize that if they bring these kinds of suits they're going to face consequences for doing it.
[00:24:29.757 --> 00:24:44.810]  And let me just jump in because that's the one point I should have made when I got up here today is, we have basically filed a suit back against them with this filing to have it thrown out, then citing the SLAPP statute, the lawyer's survey, he explained it, if I get it wrong.
[00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:46.671]  That is a lawsuit.
[00:24:46.671 --> 00:24:52.897]  We are going for the damages of the cost, our time and energy via this fraudulent suit.
[00:24:52.897 --> 00:24:56.560]  So I should have just opened this up by saying we're citing the anti-SLAPP statute.
[00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.162]  This is clearly a textbook case.
[00:24:58.162 --> 00:24:59.403]  We're going to fight this.
[00:24:59.403 --> 00:25:06.389]  And then when it's defeated, which we believe it will be because it's so classically fraudulent, they will have to pay attorney's fees and some type of damages.
[00:25:06.389 --> 00:25:07.831]  So we are countersuing.
[00:25:07.831 --> 00:25:08.732]  Is that accurate, Counselor?
[00:25:09.554 --> 00:25:10.354]  That is right.
[00:25:10.354 --> 00:25:15.637]  We have filed an anti-SLAPP motion under the Texas anti-SLAPP statute as well as the Virginia anti-SLAPP statute.
[00:25:15.637 --> 00:25:20.199]  They both provide this kind of relief and obviously we're very confident in our legal arguments.
[00:25:20.199 --> 00:25:21.420]  I think there's a last question in the back.
[00:25:30.415 --> 00:25:53.471]  I'm Carrie Donovan from Populous Wire and I'm I was being sued by the same group that was suing Roger just as a citizen and we do citizen journalism at Popwire at Populous Wire and so my question is what can I'm trying to bring people in and giving them give them a platform to speak and you know post their stuff and now I'm really kind of scared I'm thinking what can I do to help protect
[00:25:54.131 --> 00:25:55.312]  Just the average American.
[00:25:55.312 --> 00:25:56.692]  But see, that's the whole point.
[00:25:56.692 --> 00:25:59.414]  Now we're learning about all these little folks that are being sued.
[00:25:59.414 --> 00:26:01.335]  There's a huge underground campaign.
[00:26:01.335 --> 00:26:02.315]  You're an expert on this.
[00:26:02.315 --> 00:26:02.756]  Follow us.
[00:26:02.756 --> 00:26:07.658]  How big is this iceberg under the water of Soros and leftist bullying?
[00:26:07.658 --> 00:26:10.500]  I mean, we have seen more and more of this in recent years.
[00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:16.563]  People, rather than engaging in public debate, simply going to court to challenge people and bringing defamation claims.
[00:26:16.903 --> 00:26:17.203]  I think so.
[00:26:46.098 --> 00:26:48.560]  Mr. Grossman, good morning, and good morning to the InfoWars team.
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:51.121]  It's great to have you guys in D.C.
[00:26:51.121 --> 00:26:59.486]  As a citizen journalist myself, I've been encouraged to join the fight, finding InfoWars and looking for the truth.
[00:26:59.486 --> 00:27:01.587]  Again, it's great to have you guys here.
[00:27:01.587 --> 00:27:07.111]  I'm just curious what you think about the modern-day legal profession and having lawyers for hire these days.
[00:27:07.111 --> 00:27:15.396]  They're willing to file just about any type of lawsuit against free speech groups like Alex Jones and people fighting to get the real news out.
[00:27:16.317 --> 00:27:23.775]  What does it say about when millions of dollars are just brought to these lawyers to bring these types of lawsuits forward?
[00:27:23.775 --> 00:27:25.279]  What does it say about the profession these days?
[00:27:26.645 --> 00:27:38.270]  I mean, everybody has a right to legal representation, both when they're, you know, subject to criminal charges, but also just as a general matter to represent them in whatever disputes they may have to petition the government and so on.
[00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:47.895]  But at the same time, every time a lawyer signs a pleading before a court, that lawyer is certified that there is a colorable basis for that claim and that it's based upon law and that it's based upon facts.
[00:27:47.895 --> 00:27:52.957]  And if lawyers are filing things that violate those certifications, they deserve to be sanctioned for that.
[00:27:53.517 --> 00:27:54.798]  There are rules that deal with this.
[00:27:54.798 --> 00:28:02.541]  There are, as I mentioned, the anti-SLAPP statutes that deal with these kinds of speech-suppressing lawsuits.
[00:28:02.541 --> 00:28:08.224]  And, you know, that is the framework that we work in to address that problem.
[00:28:08.224 --> 00:28:12.326]  Thank you.
[00:28:12.326 --> 00:28:18.189]  Are you guys going to be filing any complaints against the bar for this frivolous filing?
[00:28:20.501 --> 00:28:23.129]  It's not something that we're talking about now.
[00:28:28.325 --> 00:28:29.286]  Thank you so much.
[00:28:29.286 --> 00:28:39.572]  And again, just to be clear, we have filed an anti-SLAPP lawsuit against this fraudulent suit filed by Georgetown, and by the individual that they used to file it.
[00:28:39.572 --> 00:28:42.834]  And so that's really the big news here today, and I should have announced that up front.
[00:28:42.834 --> 00:28:52.559]  Can you just spend a minute technically explaining that to folks again, because it didn't seem to stick with me, even though I know... All right, ladies and gentlemen, the full video you can find on the Alex Jones Facebook page, and it'll be on the YouTube channel as well.
[00:28:52.559 --> 00:28:53.540]  More clips coming.

[00:31:06.845 --> 00:31:07.685]  I take this.
[00:31:07.685 --> 00:31:08.825]  My family takes this.
[00:31:08.825 --> 00:31:13.107]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.

[00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:23.471]  I don't feel good.
[00:31:23.471 --> 00:31:27.232]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[00:31:27.232 --> 00:31:29.933]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[00:31:29.933 --> 00:31:35.736]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[00:31:35.736 --> 00:31:38.697]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[00:31:38.697 --> 00:31:42.119]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[00:31:42.119 --> 00:31:44.460]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:44.820]  I love it.
[00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:47.784]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[00:31:47.784 --> 00:31:48.805]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:31:48.805 --> 00:31:54.432]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[00:31:54.432 --> 00:31:56.635]  It's got a five-star rating.
[00:31:56.635 --> 00:31:58.838]  It's a win-win in fullwarslife.com.
[00:32:00.526 --> 00:32:04.268]  We need to fund this operation, ladies and gentlemen, and I make it really easy.
[00:32:04.268 --> 00:32:11.332]  We went out and looked at what the top nootropics or brain pills are that are healthy for energy, stamina, mental clarity, you name it.
[00:32:11.332 --> 00:32:16.075]  And we created a stronger formula than some of the best-selling formulas out there.
[00:32:16.075 --> 00:32:16.835]  It's very simple.
[00:32:16.835 --> 00:32:19.337]  We went out and looked at what is the top, what is the best.
[00:32:19.337 --> 00:32:21.278]  We'll just put even more product in, we'll make it better.
[00:32:21.278 --> 00:32:24.960]  Leading competitors put $2 a product in it, sell it for $60.
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:27.121]  We put $10 in it and sell it for $30.
[00:32:27.121 --> 00:32:27.742]  It's $19.95 right now.
[00:32:29.943 --> 00:32:33.145]  So you get an incredible top-of-the-line new Tropic for $19.95.
[00:32:33.145 --> 00:32:37.408]  Believe me, we're selling it for $35 on average.
[00:32:37.408 --> 00:32:41.271]  We need that $15, $20 we make to fund this operation in the face of the Globals, the rest of it.
[00:32:41.271 --> 00:32:45.133]  But I'm doing this because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks.
[00:32:45.133 --> 00:32:48.315]  I want to sell it all out before the big supply comes in.
[00:32:48.315 --> 00:32:51.938]  And I want people that haven't tried Brain Force to try it and find out why.
[00:32:51.938 --> 00:32:54.539]  It's got 6,000-plus five-star reviews.
[00:32:54.539 --> 00:32:55.540]  It's amazing.
[00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:58.082]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslive.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:33:03.384 --> 00:33:11.708]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:11.708 --> 00:33:24.453]  And now, the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation, it's Owen Troyer.
[00:33:24.453 --> 00:33:27.074]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:44.364 --> 00:33:59.591]  Alright, Alex Jones invades the DC swamp, which right now seems to be permeating the Trump agenda, as we're all anxiously awaiting to see what happens in Syria.
[00:34:00.714 --> 00:34:04.796]  Being on the brink of World War 3 with Russia and Iran.
[00:34:04.796 --> 00:34:11.379]  If we move forward with an intervention and regime change in Syria.
[00:34:11.379 --> 00:34:17.002]  But Alex Jones is in the swamp and he's addressing the attacks on the Second Amendment.
[00:34:17.002 --> 00:34:21.684]  A lot of which comes with the fake news that they report about us.
[00:34:23.052 --> 00:34:28.274]  And then try to spin it into a campaign to have us censored and have us removed.
[00:34:28.274 --> 00:34:32.876]  Here's Alex Jones talking about some of those instances.
[00:34:32.876 --> 00:34:49.143]  What Mr. Gilmour, and again I think he's a good guy, what Soros and the university is doing with taxpayer money, what he's doing here is twisting our words beyond all recognition so that he can play the victim and bring a lawsuit against myself and get headlines.
[00:34:49.143 --> 00:34:51.084]  And that's what the university is really looking for.
[00:34:51.084 --> 00:34:52.445]  Headlines against the First Amendment.
[00:34:53.212 --> 00:34:54.954]  He seems to be enjoying it.
[00:34:54.954 --> 00:34:56.015]  And he is a public figure.
[00:34:56.015 --> 00:34:57.957]  He's writing articles about it.
[00:34:57.957 --> 00:35:01.420]  And it did get him a lot of headlines when he did file it.
[00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:05.945]  Will there be that many headlines when it gets thrown out of court?
[00:35:05.945 --> 00:35:10.509]  Again, in completion, this isn't just a regular lawsuit.
[00:35:10.509 --> 00:35:11.130]  This is critical.
[00:35:12.312 --> 00:35:17.835]  There's a special term for it, a strategic lawsuit against public participation or SLAPP.
[00:35:17.835 --> 00:35:24.818]  What that means is a lawsuit filed to punish someone for their speech, to force legal expenses on them.
[00:35:24.818 --> 00:35:26.459]  It's an abuse of the legal system.
[00:35:26.459 --> 00:35:33.323]  It's a weaponization of the legal system to intimidate and bully and stifle the First Amendment.
[00:35:34.707 --> 00:35:44.510]  That's why so many states have anti-SLAPP laws that go beyond the First Amendment to get these kind of cases dismissed first and then punish the plaintiff for filing it in the first place.
[00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:45.830]  Soros has deep pockets.
[00:35:45.830 --> 00:35:47.191]  The Democrats have deep pockets.
[00:35:47.191 --> 00:35:50.852]  They've got taxpayer money and all these grants they're funneling into Georgetown.
[00:35:50.852 --> 00:35:52.032]  That should be investigated.
[00:35:52.032 --> 00:35:52.872]  Congress should investigate it.
[00:35:52.872 --> 00:35:54.133]  They claim they're a private university.
[00:35:54.833 --> 00:36:02.986]  But see, it's the people that are used, the pawns that are brought in by the Democrats and told, you've been wronged, and who are signed on to these.
[00:36:02.986 --> 00:36:07.252]  There was even a Daily Beast article that had a top lawyer in there saying, this is very dangerous.
[00:36:08.345 --> 00:36:20.371]  These plaintiffs, not just in this case but others, that are suing Jones, these lawsuits openly are just to demonize Jones and the First Amendment and are pieces of defamatory propaganda.
[00:36:20.371 --> 00:36:22.191]  They're going to end up getting sued.
[00:36:22.191 --> 00:36:28.114]  They're going to end up losing slap because they state in the lawsuits, we want to destroy Jones.
[00:36:28.114 --> 00:36:29.775]  This is to teach Jones a lesson.
[00:36:29.775 --> 00:36:35.357]  And then when we show that what they're saying isn't true, it's the definition of malice aforethought and intent to do harm.
[00:36:37.276 --> 00:36:45.845]  Inversion, defame, lie, file it in court, have the media then parry it out everywhere else, and then try to intimidate and destroy people.
[00:36:45.845 --> 00:36:47.167]  Talk about diabolical.
[00:36:47.167 --> 00:36:49.729]  It is diabolical because it's coming right out of George Soros.
[00:36:51.144 --> 00:36:56.866]  The Texas statute requires a slap plaintiff to pay all the defendant's expenses and also sanctions.
[00:36:56.866 --> 00:37:02.227]  And we've got free lawyers on it, just in this lawsuit, to stop it from happening again.
[00:37:02.227 --> 00:37:08.209]  We're asking the court here to find the lawsuit as a slap and to make Brendan Gilmore pay our expenses.
[00:37:08.209 --> 00:37:12.530]  The point is that you shouldn't be able to do this kind of thing with impunity.
[00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:18.192]  And we want to make sure that Brendan Gilmore and the world think twice before they decide to take someone to court.
[00:37:18.773 --> 00:37:20.197]  Overprotected speech.
[00:37:20.197 --> 00:37:21.722]  And in closing, I'll say this.
[00:37:21.722 --> 00:37:23.006]  I wish Mr. Gilmour no harm.
[00:37:24.093 --> 00:37:32.999]  We need to send messages to all these folks when the lawyers and the professors involved are saying, we will never settle, we want to destroy Jones.
[00:37:32.999 --> 00:37:40.204]  This is in the public venue, jumping around like they are in heaven, like they're at a party.
[00:37:40.204 --> 00:37:43.886]  And then you read what's in the lawsuit and almost none of it's true or it's twisted.
[00:37:43.886 --> 00:37:52.672]  Again, this is an assault on all of you, an assault on the press, an assault on the heart of this republic, right as we're trying to have a new renaissance and bring the nation back.
[00:37:54.619 --> 00:38:10.500]  You know, as I sit here and think about what Alex is saying in his address there at the National Press Club in D.C., you've got the attack on the First Amendment where it used to be they used political correctness
[00:38:11.854 --> 00:38:21.001]  To psychologically bully you into not expressing yourself or, you know, oh, maybe I shouldn't say that, you know, constantly looking around your shoulder.
[00:38:21.001 --> 00:38:22.222]  Oh, who could I offend here?
[00:38:22.222 --> 00:38:23.783]  Who could I not offend?
[00:38:23.783 --> 00:38:30.708]  So political correctness over speech was the first censorship of free speech.
[00:38:30.708 --> 00:38:36.873]  A psychological bullying campaign to make you worry that you might say something that offends somebody.
[00:38:38.561 --> 00:38:44.966]  Well, Trump destroyed that, people got sick of that, and so that kind of died out.
[00:38:44.966 --> 00:39:02.700]  And so now they take it to the next level and they use their Democrat operatives, their bleeding-heart liberals that run these social media networks, run the CNNs, work at the Googles and the YouTubes, to censor us, make algorithms
[00:39:04.432 --> 00:39:13.219]  Make terms of service so that you can say it's unsafe to the community, your videos, your content, and then you get censored.
[00:39:13.219 --> 00:39:16.221]  And so they have this veil of righteousness.
[00:39:16.221 --> 00:39:18.723]  They have this veil of justification.
[00:39:18.723 --> 00:39:21.005]  But it's all political.
[00:39:21.005 --> 00:39:22.686]  It's all agenda driven.
[00:39:22.686 --> 00:39:25.629]  And so that's how they attack the First Amendment.
[00:39:25.629 --> 00:39:27.010]  That's what we're going through.
[00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:30.112]  That's what Alex Jones is addressing in D.C.
[00:39:30.112 --> 00:39:32.334]  Then you've got the attacks on the Second Amendment.
[00:39:34.269 --> 00:39:50.138]  Where, take an event like Florida, where you've got all of these red flags about the shooter, you've got local law enforcement stand down, FBI stand down, I mean, on the scene stand down, like total failure.
[00:39:50.138 --> 00:40:00.144]  In fact, you know, so bad you have to ask, is this blatant incompetence or a stand down?
[00:40:00.144 --> 00:40:01.605]  But then the media
[00:40:03.254 --> 00:40:10.478]  He focuses on the gun and says, oh my gosh, the gun is to blame.
[00:40:10.478 --> 00:40:12.680]  The Second Amendment is the problem.
[00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:13.600]  That's how we solve this.
[00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:17.883]  So then they attack the Second Amendment.
[00:40:17.883 --> 00:40:22.406]  And then, you have Robert Mueller.
[00:40:22.406 --> 00:40:24.007]  Who does Robert Mueller answer to?
[00:40:24.007 --> 00:40:25.147]  Well, nobody.
[00:40:25.147 --> 00:40:28.649]  Robert Mueller answers to Robert Mueller.
[00:40:28.649 --> 00:40:30.250]  God answers to Robert Mueller.
[00:40:30.250 --> 00:40:30.951]  Didn't you know this?
[00:40:34.898 --> 00:40:51.101]  And so now you have an attack on the very fabric of the justice system of innocent till proven guilty of no one's above the law with Robert Mueller.
[00:40:51.101 --> 00:40:58.323]  And I remember last week joking about how they always use this buzzword, he broadens his investigation.
[00:40:58.323 --> 00:41:00.023]  Robert Mueller is broadening.
[00:41:00.023 --> 00:41:02.564]  Yeah, because he can't find anything.
[00:41:02.564 --> 00:41:03.124]  So now,
[00:41:05.808 --> 00:41:11.831]  You have an FBI that works for a porn star, Stormy Daniels.
[00:41:11.831 --> 00:41:16.234]  So the FBI invades Michael Cohen's office, Trump's attorney.
[00:41:16.234 --> 00:41:18.355]  Why?
[00:41:18.355 --> 00:41:21.376]  Why?
[00:41:21.376 --> 00:41:24.758]  Is there Russian collusion going on here?
[00:41:24.758 --> 00:41:27.180]  Does this have something to do with Russia?
[00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:29.141]  Stormy Daniels, Russian?
[00:41:29.141 --> 00:41:33.243]  I mean, where is the Russian probe come into play
[00:41:34.602 --> 00:41:42.373]  When you're raiding Trump's attorney's office because of a porn star's beef.
[00:41:42.373 --> 00:41:45.397]  So, there you go.
[00:41:45.397 --> 00:41:51.025]  How about an assault on the very fabric of the bureaucracies in this country that ought to be shut down?
[00:41:53.396 --> 00:42:19.106]  So Stormy Daniels is trying to sue Trump, she's trying to get rid of whatever gag order or confidentiality agreement she signed, but she can't get it done, and the media gladly promotes her porn tour, Make America Horny Again, and they don't even realize they're making Stormy Daniels rich, and she's totally using them, but she's still not getting what she wants legally, so bring in the FBI.
[00:42:20.046 --> 00:42:21.747]  Let's help Stormy Daniels out.
[00:42:21.747 --> 00:42:23.768]  Let's help this porn star out.
[00:42:23.768 --> 00:42:30.770]  She's been victimized by Trump, even though, if anything happened, it was all consensual and she's never said otherwise.
[00:42:30.770 --> 00:42:31.471]  Let's go ahead.
[00:42:31.471 --> 00:42:32.591]  You know what, Stormy?
[00:42:32.591 --> 00:42:35.492]  We're sorry that you didn't get the result you wanted legally.
[00:42:35.492 --> 00:42:38.734]  Financially, you're doing very well, but legally, you didn't get the result you wanted.
[00:42:38.734 --> 00:42:39.194]  So, you know what?
[00:42:39.194 --> 00:42:39.934]  I'm Robert Mueller.
[00:42:39.934 --> 00:42:41.655]  FBI?
[00:42:42.884 --> 00:42:43.765]  Hey, go in there.
[00:42:43.765 --> 00:42:45.806]  Can you go into Trump's lawyer's office?
[00:42:45.806 --> 00:42:48.647]  Let's get all the documents they have on Stormy Daniels.
[00:42:48.647 --> 00:42:50.168]  Stormy, we got you, babe.
[00:42:50.168 --> 00:42:50.809]  We got you, babe.
[00:42:50.809 --> 00:42:51.609]  I'm Robert Mueller.
[00:42:51.609 --> 00:42:52.710]  God answers to me.
[00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:54.271]  I got you, Stormy Daniels.
[00:42:54.271 --> 00:42:58.233]  So they're just assaulting America altogether, and we're just supposed to remain calm and act like nothing's wrong.
[00:42:59.997 --> 00:43:00.798]  I'm so excited.
[00:43:00.798 --> 00:43:10.945]  The new product at m4warslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[00:43:10.945 --> 00:43:16.470]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic, that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:19.472]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[00:43:19.472 --> 00:43:28.259]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[00:43:30.339 --> 00:43:35.643]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers.
[00:43:35.643 --> 00:43:40.607]  Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[00:43:40.607 --> 00:43:49.935]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[00:43:49.935 --> 00:43:52.617]  It is amazing!
[00:43:52.617 --> 00:43:57.581]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com and your purchase funds the operation.
[00:43:59.753 --> 00:44:05.339]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60-plus products, we have it in 4's life.
[00:44:05.339 --> 00:44:06.220]  It'd take hours.
[00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:08.662]  Michael's ZX Plus now has a lower price.
[00:44:08.662 --> 00:44:09.844]  It's stronger.
[00:44:09.844 --> 00:44:11.445]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[00:44:11.445 --> 00:44:14.669]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[00:44:14.669 --> 00:44:15.790]  It's back in stock.
[00:44:15.790 --> 00:44:18.973]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.
[00:44:18.973 --> 00:44:22.297]  It's got the preglanone that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[00:44:22.737 --> 00:44:22.877]  Yeah.
[00:44:41.477 --> 00:44:43.458]  High quality silver and a lot more.
[00:44:43.458 --> 00:44:44.838]  Without you, we couldn't do it.

[00:47:20.791 --> 00:47:24.635]  Well, it certainly feels like we're in the storm now.
[00:47:24.635 --> 00:47:26.798]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:26.798 --> 00:47:29.260]  Alex Jones is in D.C.
[00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:30.462]  invading the swamp.
[00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:34.681]  Of course, his press conference was earlier this morning.
[00:47:34.681 --> 00:47:35.461]  We've been playing clips.
[00:47:35.461 --> 00:47:38.142]  We'll have some more clips for you as well.
[00:47:38.142 --> 00:47:42.883]  And this is all possible with your support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:47:42.883 --> 00:47:47.364]  We've got some specials running now on some of our most popular products, including Alpha Power.
[00:47:47.364 --> 00:47:48.124]  25% off Alpha Power.
[00:47:50.825 --> 00:47:59.110]  At InfowarsStore.com, this was out of stock, but we've got it back in stock, and we're bringing it to you at 25% off.
[00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:07.274]  Relatively new product, so we don't have too many reviews, but of the reviews we have, 4.6 stars out of 5 stars.
[00:48:07.274 --> 00:48:12.077]  So you know it's effective, you know it's good stuff.
[00:48:12.077 --> 00:48:16.300]  And after we just sold out the last batch, I would imagine we're going to have a large
[00:48:17.285 --> 00:48:19.366]  Large portion of reviews coming in.
[00:48:19.366 --> 00:48:27.471]  I expect them to be high ratings as that's what we get for all of our products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:48:27.471 --> 00:48:30.953]  Don't forget about Cell Force which is 50% off right now.
[00:48:30.953 --> 00:48:31.914]  So 50% off Cell Force.
[00:48:34.603 --> 00:48:39.686]  And 50% off the real Red Pill at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:48:39.686 --> 00:48:41.848]  They're just going down the store right now.
[00:48:41.848 --> 00:48:44.349]  I'm just looking at all the stuff that's 50% off.
[00:48:44.349 --> 00:48:48.192]  So Cell Force is 50% off right now as well.
[00:48:48.192 --> 00:48:52.774]  Again, that's got the CoQ10 in there.
[00:48:52.774 --> 00:48:56.177]  And it's a product that we're actually
[00:48:57.429 --> 00:48:58.469]  Making it more powerful.
[00:48:58.469 --> 00:49:04.952]  So this is actually a more powerful version of a previous product that was already highly rated and a newer version.
[00:49:04.952 --> 00:49:06.993]  So Cell Force is 50% off right now.
[00:49:06.993 --> 00:49:09.654]  Take advantage of that.
[00:49:09.654 --> 00:49:11.955]  Of course, Alexa Pure Breeze still $50 off.
[00:49:11.955 --> 00:49:14.136]  I guess we're just going to keep that special running.
[00:49:14.136 --> 00:49:14.837]  That's a great deal.
[00:49:15.976 --> 00:49:20.459]  Before we run out, $50 off Alexa Pure Breeze air filters.
[00:49:20.459 --> 00:49:23.661]  And there's all kinds of stuff at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:49:23.661 --> 00:49:30.186]  Hats, t-shirts, survival equipment, survival food, body armor.
[00:49:30.186 --> 00:49:32.587]  I mean, the store is so massive now.
[00:49:32.587 --> 00:49:38.652]  If you can't find something that you like or that you're interested in, you haven't tried, you haven't looked.
[00:49:39.232 --> 00:49:42.053]  And there's also household items like toothpaste and shampoo.
[00:49:42.053 --> 00:49:45.274]  So check it all out at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:49:45.274 --> 00:49:46.254]  That's how you support us.
[00:49:46.254 --> 00:49:49.875]  That's how we're able to have a big press conference event in D.C.
[00:49:49.875 --> 00:49:54.796]  That's how we're able to have a 34-hour live broadcast on Thursday.
[00:49:54.796 --> 00:49:59.057]  That's this Thursday, 34-hour live broadcast.
[00:49:59.057 --> 00:50:07.620]  So, we were just addressing the attacks
[00:50:08.664 --> 00:50:25.370]  On free speech, the attacks on the Second Amendment, the attacks against us, the attacks on the very integrity of America and its judicial system, its justice system, and everything in between.
[00:50:25.370 --> 00:50:31.773]  So Trump yesterday responded to the FBI raid on his lawyer's office for a porn star.
[00:50:33.049 --> 00:50:34.070]  We've got two clips of that.
[00:50:34.070 --> 00:50:35.311]  Let's roll the first one.
[00:50:35.311 --> 00:50:42.697]  Again, this is President Trump responding to the FBI raid yesterday.
[00:50:42.697 --> 00:50:43.758]  There's Bolton next to him.
[00:50:43.758 --> 00:50:50.963]  I just heard that they broke into the office of one of my personal attorneys.
[00:50:50.963 --> 00:50:52.665]  Good man.
[00:50:52.665 --> 00:50:55.026]  And it's a disgraceful situation.
[00:50:55.026 --> 00:50:56.007]  It's a total witch hunt.
[00:50:56.007 --> 00:50:57.609]  I've been saying it for a long time.
[00:50:57.609 --> 00:50:59.570]  I've wanted to keep it down.
[00:51:01.787 --> 00:51:07.551]  I believe over a million pages worth of documents to the special counsel.
[00:51:07.551 --> 00:51:09.453]  They continue to just go forward.
[00:51:09.453 --> 00:51:13.015]  And here we are talking about Syria.
[00:51:13.015 --> 00:51:17.378]  We're talking about a lot of serious things with the greatest fighting force ever.
[00:51:17.378 --> 00:51:24.463]  And I have this witch hunt constantly going on for over 12 months now.
[00:51:24.463 --> 00:51:26.004]  And actually much more than that.
[00:51:26.004 --> 00:51:28.806]  You could say it was right after I won the nomination and started.
[00:51:30.107 --> 00:51:31.088]  And it's a disgrace.
[00:51:31.088 --> 00:51:32.569]  It's frankly a real disgrace.
[00:51:32.569 --> 00:51:36.511]  It's an attack on our country in a true sense.
[00:51:36.511 --> 00:51:40.614]  It's an attack on what we all stand for.
[00:51:40.614 --> 00:51:44.536]  So when I saw this and when I heard it, I heard it like you did.
[00:51:44.536 --> 00:51:46.938]  I said that is really now in a whole
[00:51:48.243 --> 00:51:50.746]  New level of unfairness.
[00:51:50.746 --> 00:51:52.668]  So this has been going on.
[00:51:52.668 --> 00:52:00.878]  I saw one of the reporters who is not necessarily a fan of mine, not necessarily very good to me.
[00:52:00.878 --> 00:52:03.401]  He said in effect that this is ridiculous.
[00:52:03.401 --> 00:52:04.862]  This is now getting ridiculous.
[00:52:04.862 --> 00:52:07.285]  They found no collusion whatsoever with Russia.
[00:52:08.507 --> 00:52:11.969]  The reason they found it is there was no collusion at all.
[00:52:11.969 --> 00:52:13.829]  No collusion.
[00:52:13.829 --> 00:52:19.772]  This is the most biased group of people.
[00:52:19.772 --> 00:52:24.494]  These people have the biggest conflicts of interest I've ever seen.
[00:52:24.494 --> 00:52:28.256]  Democrats, all, or just about all.
[00:52:28.256 --> 00:52:31.738]  Either Democrats or a couple of Republicans that worked for President Obama.
[00:52:32.885 --> 00:52:34.526]  They're not looking at the other side.
[00:52:34.526 --> 00:52:40.109]  They're not looking at the Hillary Clinton, horrible things that she did and all of the crimes that were committed.
[00:52:40.109 --> 00:52:46.914]  They're not looking at all of the things that happened that everybody is very angry about.
[00:52:46.914 --> 00:52:52.857]  I can tell you from the Republican side, and I think even the Independent side, they only keep looking at us.
[00:52:52.857 --> 00:52:54.999]  So they find no collusion.
[00:52:54.999 --> 00:52:58.821]  And then they go from there and they say, well, let's keep going.
[00:52:58.821 --> 00:53:01.983]  And they raid an office of a personal attorney early in the morning.
[00:53:03.385 --> 00:53:06.607]  And I think it's a disgrace, so we'll be talking about it more.
[00:53:06.607 --> 00:53:09.369]  But this is the most conflicted group of people I've ever seen.
[00:53:09.369 --> 00:53:20.797]  The Attorney General made a terrible mistake when he did this, and when he recused himself, or he should have certainly let us know if he was going to recuse himself.
[00:53:20.797 --> 00:53:24.739]  And we would have put a different Attorney General in.
[00:53:24.739 --> 00:53:28.322]  So he made what I consider to be a very terrible mistake for the country.
[00:53:29.508 --> 00:53:30.949]  But you'll figure that out.
[00:53:30.949 --> 00:53:44.437]  All I can say is after looking for a long period of time, not even before the special counsel, because it really started just about from the time I won the nomination.
[00:53:44.437 --> 00:53:50.461]  And you look at what took place and what happened, and it's a disgrace.
[00:53:50.461 --> 00:53:50.781]  It's a disgrace.
[00:53:52.145 --> 00:54:02.990]  And to provide a little color to what Trump was saying about Clinton, we've got the story at Infowars.com right now from Information Liberation's Chris Menehan.
[00:54:02.990 --> 00:54:10.593]  Mueller investigating Trump over a $150,000 donation from Ukrainian who gave Clinton's $13 million.
[00:54:10.593 --> 00:54:15.115]  And so the average liberal would say, Trump won, Trump's the president, not Hillary.
[00:54:16.184 --> 00:54:22.167]  Okay, well Hillary was in the State Department when she got these donations and Trump wasn't in government.
[00:54:22.167 --> 00:54:23.788]  So, ouch.
[00:54:23.788 --> 00:54:26.029]  I guess the liberal response failed again.
[00:54:26.029 --> 00:54:30.451]  Let's now go to another clip of Trump responding to the FBI raid.
[00:54:33.010 --> 00:54:35.391]  Well, I think it's a disgrace what's going on.
[00:54:35.391 --> 00:54:36.351]  We'll see what happens.
[00:54:36.351 --> 00:54:40.513]  But I think it's really a sad situation when you look at what happened.
[00:54:40.513 --> 00:54:43.834]  Many people have said you should fire him.
[00:54:43.834 --> 00:54:46.575]  Again, they found nothing.
[00:54:46.575 --> 00:54:50.096]  And in finding nothing, that's a big statement.
[00:54:50.096 --> 00:54:53.498]  If you know the person who's in charge of the investigation,
[00:54:55.338 --> 00:54:57.039]  You know all about that.
[00:54:57.039 --> 00:55:04.562]  Deputy Rosenstein, Ron Rosenstein, he wrote the letter very critical of Comey.
[00:55:04.562 --> 00:55:06.162]  One of the things they said, I fired Comey.
[00:55:06.162 --> 00:55:17.707]  Well, I turned out to do the right thing because you look at all of the things that he's done and the lies, and you look at what's gone on at the FBI with the insurance policy and all of the things that happened.
[00:55:18.607 --> 00:55:21.069]  Turned out I did the right thing.
[00:55:21.069 --> 00:55:24.733]  But he signed, as you know, he also signed the Pfizer warrant.
[00:55:25.996 --> 00:55:31.199]  So Rod Rosenstein, who's in charge of this, signed a FISA warrant.
[00:55:31.199 --> 00:55:38.684]  And he also signed a letter that was essentially saying to fire James Comey.
[00:55:38.684 --> 00:55:39.685]  And he was right about that.
[00:55:39.685 --> 00:55:41.726]  He was absolutely right.
[00:55:41.726 --> 00:55:43.688]  So we'll see what happens.
[00:55:43.688 --> 00:55:46.769]  I think it's disgraceful, and so does a lot of other people.
[00:55:46.769 --> 00:55:50.372]  This is a pure and simple witch hunt.
[00:55:50.372 --> 00:55:51.312]  Thank you very much.
[00:55:51.312 --> 00:55:51.633]  Thank you.
[00:55:52.293 --> 00:55:56.016]  Wow, we've actually, we've got an exclusive right now folks.
[00:55:56.016 --> 00:56:01.839]  Robert Mueller himself has actually dialed into the program to respond to President Trump.
[00:56:01.839 --> 00:56:03.861]  Lord Mueller, what is your response?
[00:56:10.055 --> 00:56:11.497]  Oh, he is the law.
[00:56:11.497 --> 00:56:11.977]  Okay.
[00:56:11.977 --> 00:56:12.958]  And then he blasts off.
[00:56:12.958 --> 00:56:24.429]  He's got to head back over to the Make America Horny Again headquarters and get his latest orders from headquarters and Stormy Daniels.
[00:56:24.429 --> 00:56:27.772]  So Robert Mueller now answers to Stormy Daniels.
[00:56:27.772 --> 00:56:30.675]  And, you know, she's got him on speed dial.
[00:56:30.675 --> 00:56:34.959]  And if she doesn't like the result of
[00:56:36.820 --> 00:56:48.083]  Her litigation against Trump and his attorney Michael Cohen, then she just calls Robert Mueller and Lord Mueller flies over there and, you know, he raids the attorney's office for the documents.
[00:56:48.083 --> 00:56:52.865]  Because he works for Stormy Daniels.
[00:56:52.865 --> 00:56:57.786]  I mean, that's what we're paying Mueller to do, right?
[00:56:57.786 --> 00:57:01.868]  Work for a porn star who's trying to bring Trump down?
[00:57:01.868 --> 00:57:02.548]  Or not even that!
[00:57:03.410 --> 00:57:06.692]  Work for a porn star who's just trying to make money.
[00:57:06.692 --> 00:57:15.018]  I mean, it really tells you the state of the media.
[00:57:15.018 --> 00:57:27.247]  That they're so dumb, they can be used and abused for publicity, marketing, building a brand, promoting a tour.
[00:57:27.247 --> 00:57:27.908]  A porn star
[00:57:29.335 --> 00:57:35.440]  Can deceive and trick and twist the media around as long as it goes along with their agenda.
[00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:37.922]  Sure, we'll promote a porn star.
[00:57:37.922 --> 00:57:39.963]  Sure, Robert Mueller will work for a porn star.
[00:57:39.963 --> 00:57:40.824]  It's all okay.
[00:57:40.824 --> 00:57:46.688]  We'll go along with the porn star as long as it works for our agenda of destroying this country and bringing Trump down.
[00:57:46.688 --> 00:57:47.609]  Yeah, porn star.
[00:57:47.609 --> 00:57:48.349]  Yeah, Robert Mueller.

[01:00:27.631 --> 01:00:44.496]  Do you remember when Joy Behar was celebrating like a little schoolgirl when somebody handed her a little note that there were indictments coming from Mueller's collusion probe?
[01:00:44.496 --> 01:00:45.816]  Lord Mueller's collusion probe.
[01:00:45.816 --> 01:00:46.676]  She gets handed a little note.
[01:00:46.676 --> 01:00:50.097]  She celebrates like a little girl on air.
[01:00:50.097 --> 01:00:50.618]  Whee!
[01:00:50.618 --> 01:00:51.258]  Indictments!
[01:00:51.258 --> 01:00:52.038]  Trump collusion!
[01:00:52.038 --> 01:00:53.518]  Russia!
[01:00:53.518 --> 01:00:54.419]  Whee!
[01:00:54.419 --> 01:00:55.539]  Turns out to be fake news.
[01:00:57.244 --> 01:00:59.707]  But she looked like, uh, quite the clown that day.
[01:00:59.707 --> 01:01:01.508]  And every day.
[01:01:01.508 --> 01:01:04.672]  Oh, there she is.
[01:01:04.672 --> 01:01:06.173]  Oh yeah, go to the audio, guys.
[01:01:06.173 --> 01:01:08.255]  Can you put the audio up?
[01:01:08.255 --> 01:01:09.096]  Oh.
[01:01:09.096 --> 01:01:09.917]  Oh, Joy Behar.
[01:01:09.917 --> 01:01:10.718]  Clown Behar here.
[01:01:13.801 --> 01:01:14.902]  Breaking news.
[01:01:14.902 --> 01:01:16.184]  Oh my god.
[01:01:16.184 --> 01:01:17.105]  Oh, breaking news.
[01:01:17.105 --> 01:01:29.839]  ABC News Brian Ross is reporting Michael Flynn promised full cooperation to the Mueller team and is prepared to testify that as a candidate Donald Trump directed him to make contact with the Russians!
[01:01:43.814 --> 01:01:48.699]  Yeah, and then Meghan McCain is standing there like, what are you celebrating?
[01:01:48.699 --> 01:01:50.200]  What?
[01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:52.242]  That's like somebody hands you a note.
[01:01:52.242 --> 01:01:56.606]  They just did the final tally and Hitler gassed a million Jews!
[01:01:56.606 --> 01:01:57.767]  Woo!
[01:01:57.767 --> 01:01:59.209]  Woo!
[01:01:59.209 --> 01:01:59.909]  We told you!
[01:01:59.909 --> 01:02:01.451]  Ha ha ha!
[01:02:01.451 --> 01:02:02.632]  Like, whoa, psycho.
[01:02:02.632 --> 01:02:03.192]  Psycho.
[01:02:14.454 --> 01:02:16.035]  Do you get it?
[01:02:16.035 --> 01:02:18.676]  These people hate America.
[01:02:18.676 --> 01:02:21.777]  They want to see America be brought to its knees.
[01:02:21.777 --> 01:02:25.098]  And that's why they celebrate, yay, this country's so corrupt!
[01:02:25.098 --> 01:02:29.959]  Finally, we can justify destroying it and hating it and get all the youth to hate it too!
[01:02:29.959 --> 01:02:31.680]  Woo-hoo!
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:33.881]  But it doesn't stop there.
[01:02:33.881 --> 01:02:42.364]  Now Stephen Colbert is celebrating the FBI's working for a porn star, the FBI raiding Trump's attorney's office
[01:02:43.743 --> 01:02:48.947]  over documents regarding a porn star from years ago.
[01:02:48.947 --> 01:02:59.056]  Here's Colbert now celebrating the total abuse of power by Robert Mueller and the FBI.
[01:02:59.056 --> 01:03:01.758]  Cohen has said he made the payment out of his own pocket.
[01:03:01.758 --> 01:03:06.262]  And for the first time, Trump addressed this subject while waiting for the bathroom on Air Force One.
[01:03:29.321 --> 01:03:31.122]  He knows nothing!
[01:03:31.122 --> 01:03:36.924]  Trump trusts his lawyer so much he lets him do stuff he doesn't know about in his name for reasons he doesn't understand.
[01:03:36.924 --> 01:03:40.945]  But the Democrats can smash servers, bleach bit servers.
[01:03:40.945 --> 01:03:43.206]  Debbie Washman Schultz can threaten police.
[01:03:43.206 --> 01:03:46.247]  They don't have to tell you or show you the evidence of any Russians hacking.
[01:03:46.247 --> 01:03:49.588]  They just say it and then erase all the actual evidence and that's okay.
[01:03:49.588 --> 01:03:51.489]  Colbert never files a report.
[01:03:51.489 --> 01:03:54.010]  But we need to find out what happened to Stormy Daniels and Trump years ago.
[01:03:54.010 --> 01:03:55.030]  I gotta go back to Colbert for this.
[01:03:57.284 --> 01:04:01.827]  That's like saying, Doc, just put me under and take out whatever you organs want, okay?
[01:04:01.827 --> 01:04:03.228]  Dealer's choice.
[01:04:03.228 --> 01:04:03.968]  You want a lung?
[01:04:03.968 --> 01:04:04.909]  You take it.
[01:04:04.909 --> 01:04:07.330]  I don't get that comparison.
[01:04:07.330 --> 01:04:08.551]  Doesn't make sense at all.
[01:04:08.551 --> 01:04:09.592]  Okay?
[01:04:09.592 --> 01:04:12.774]  No, it didn't make sense.
[01:04:12.774 --> 01:04:16.516]  So, he said on camera, just to recap, you'll have to ask Michael Cohen.
[01:04:16.516 --> 01:04:21.499]  Well, guess who watches TV?
[01:04:21.499 --> 01:04:22.240]  Robert Mueller.
[01:04:24.025 --> 01:04:34.875]  Because today, on a tip from Mueller, the FBI raided Cohen's office, seizing records related to several topics, including payments.
[01:04:34.875 --> 01:04:41.281]  So Stephen Colbert and an entire crowd of people are cheering over the story, the FBI raids an office for a porn star.
[01:04:41.281 --> 01:04:44.805]  Information about porn in a folder marked finances.
[01:04:46.471 --> 01:04:50.419]  And all of his information about finance is in a folder marked PORN!
[01:04:50.419 --> 01:04:53.906]  Congratulations Stephen Colbert and your lunatic audience.
[01:04:53.906 --> 01:04:56.472]  You just celebrated the FBI working for a porn star.
[01:04:56.472 --> 01:04:56.812]  Good for you.
[01:04:58.547 --> 01:05:04.132]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60-plus products, we have it in four's life.
[01:05:04.132 --> 01:05:04.993]  It'd take hours.
[01:05:04.993 --> 01:05:07.435]  MycoZX Plus, it now has a lower price.
[01:05:07.435 --> 01:05:08.616]  It's stronger.
[01:05:08.616 --> 01:05:10.218]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[01:05:10.218 --> 01:05:13.441]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[01:05:13.441 --> 01:05:14.562]  It's back in stock.
[01:05:14.562 --> 01:05:17.745]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.
[01:05:17.745 --> 01:05:21.068]  It's got the preglanone that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[01:05:21.508 --> 01:05:21.648]  Yeah.
[01:05:40.245 --> 01:05:42.226]  High quality silver and a lot more.
[01:05:42.226 --> 01:05:43.626]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[01:05:43.626 --> 01:05:51.450]  So thank you all for remembering InfoWareStore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake.
[01:05:51.450 --> 01:05:53.551]  And it's so essential to spread the word.
[01:05:53.551 --> 01:05:56.592]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[01:06:05.974 --> 01:06:09.215]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[01:06:09.215 --> 01:06:13.617]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[01:06:13.617 --> 01:06:20.880]  Alright, we're into the second hour here of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:26.382]  I will be with you for the remainder of this second hour and then Paul Joseph Watson takes over.
[01:06:26.382 --> 01:06:35.066]  He's going to be interviewing Syrian girl and may also be covering, doing live coverage of Mark Zuckerberg's testimony today.
[01:06:36.815 --> 01:06:39.676]  In front of a Senate committee, of course.
[01:06:39.676 --> 01:06:58.262]  It's interesting because you had him meeting with the very members of the committees and of the of the Congress that he's going to be questioned of before the official hearing and testimony.
[01:06:58.262 --> 01:06:59.202]  Hmm.
[01:06:59.202 --> 01:07:00.102]  Okay.
[01:07:00.102 --> 01:07:06.384]  And then it turns out that a lot of people in these committees, a lot of people in Congress, of course, are getting paid off by Facebook.
[01:07:08.577 --> 01:07:17.584]  Okay, so they're allowed to meet and then they're allowed to question him even though they're his clients.
[01:07:17.584 --> 01:07:22.829]  Okay, that doesn't seem like a conflict of interest at all.
[01:07:22.829 --> 01:07:27.012]  But then it comes out and gets even more ridiculous.
[01:07:29.502 --> 01:07:37.684]  Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg will not be under oath before Senate Committee, but he's compelled by a statute to tell the truth.
[01:07:37.684 --> 01:07:42.245]  Oh, I'm sure he's so compelled.
[01:07:42.245 --> 01:07:47.046]  Oh yes, I'm sure that Mark Zuckerberg is really, really compelled.
[01:07:47.046 --> 01:07:49.707]  Look at the... I mean, the guy is so compelled to tell the truth.
[01:07:49.707 --> 01:07:53.127]  He's just that kind of guy.
[01:07:53.127 --> 01:07:55.248]  Just like the kind of guy that would tell you
[01:07:56.496 --> 01:08:01.559]  He's not going to sell your personal data.
[01:08:01.559 --> 01:08:11.705]  Just like the kind of guy that's going to tell you, if I did sell your personal data, then you should not trust me and you should not want to be on my platform.
[01:08:11.705 --> 01:08:14.706]  Just that kind of guy.
[01:08:14.706 --> 01:08:16.788]  Because he's the guy that did sell your data.
[01:08:17.782 --> 01:08:21.625]  He's the guy you shouldn't trust to be on his platform.
[01:08:21.625 --> 01:08:28.851]  He's the guy who's being questioned by his own clients in a testimony that he's not going to be under oath for.
[01:08:28.851 --> 01:08:30.992]  You know what they call this?
[01:08:30.992 --> 01:08:33.975]  A pig circus.
[01:08:33.975 --> 01:08:46.825]  So Mark Zuckerberg, the globalist puppet of the communist left wing, can sell your data, gather all your data,
[01:08:49.262 --> 01:08:56.751]  And again though, let's retrace our steps actually with this because why is this going on?
[01:08:56.751 --> 01:08:59.955]  Why is Mark Zuckerberg testifying?
[01:08:59.955 --> 01:09:03.219]  Why is Facebook under a microscope now?
[01:09:03.219 --> 01:09:06.202]  What is going on here?
[01:09:06.202 --> 01:09:06.523]  Well...
[01:09:08.766 --> 01:09:10.346]  There's two elements at play.
[01:09:10.346 --> 01:09:21.769]  One, you have the Trump administration and Brad Parscale putting Facebook in the crosshairs saying, we know what you're doing, and they're getting exposed by undercover videos.
[01:09:21.769 --> 01:09:27.230]  But that wasn't really what spurred this Zuckerberg going to the swamp.
[01:09:27.230 --> 01:09:32.251]  That wasn't what spurred Zuckerberg's wife to wear a Kentucky Derby hat to Washington, D.C.
[01:09:32.251 --> 01:09:32.691]  yesterday.
[01:09:33.686 --> 01:09:45.231]  No, that was the story about Cambridge Analytica and Facebook sharing personal data with Cambridge Analytica.
[01:09:45.231 --> 01:09:50.373]  Okay, so Facebook is taking all your personal data.
[01:09:50.373 --> 01:09:51.834]  Facebook is mining all your data.
[01:09:51.834 --> 01:09:54.135]  Facebook is then selling your data.
[01:09:54.135 --> 01:09:59.097]  Facebook is selling your personal information, which you agreed to when you signed the terms of service.
[01:10:00.407 --> 01:10:03.868]  But that's now an issue because Trump won the election.
[01:10:03.868 --> 01:10:22.512]  So now we're looking at this as an issue because Trump won the election and Facebook may have actually been helpful by providing useful data to polling forums that Trump then used or Trump's team used to win an election.
[01:10:23.632 --> 01:10:26.754]  So that's bad, and we need to do something about that.
[01:10:26.754 --> 01:10:40.741]  So Zuckerberg and Facebook goes to DC for a testimony that's not under oath after he's already met with the people questioning him that are also his clients.
[01:10:40.741 --> 01:10:46.904]  But if you take a step back even further, this is when it really starts to get ludicrous.
[01:10:48.666 --> 01:10:58.593]  Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg did the exact same thing for the Obama administration.
[01:10:58.593 --> 01:11:17.686]  Now, when it was revealed that Zuckerberg and Facebook was giving data to the Obama administration, Cambridge Analytica, polling firms, whatever, to help get Obama in office, it was celebrated, it was glorified, it was genius.
[01:11:19.474 --> 01:11:29.922]  Look at the genius Obama using the data that Facebook is giving him because they basically are working hand in hand every day and bragging about it.
[01:11:29.922 --> 01:11:31.444]  And it's all good.
[01:11:31.444 --> 01:11:32.745]  All fine and dandy.
[01:11:32.745 --> 01:11:34.926]  In fact, it's celebrated.
[01:11:34.926 --> 01:11:36.528]  Way to go, Zuckerberg.
[01:11:36.528 --> 01:11:37.568]  Way to go, Obama.
[01:11:37.568 --> 01:11:42.012]  You guys are super geniuses.
[01:11:42.012 --> 01:11:44.774]  And then you fast forward.
[01:11:44.774 --> 01:11:46.776]  Facebook does the exact same thing.
[01:11:48.755 --> 01:11:53.276]  But for Trump's campaign, and now it's bad.
[01:11:53.276 --> 01:11:55.736]  Now Facebook is wrong.
[01:11:55.736 --> 01:12:00.817]  Now Facebook needs to, needs to answer the call.
[01:12:00.817 --> 01:12:05.118]  And so Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg are gonna have to testify here.
[01:12:05.118 --> 01:12:14.280]  But don't worry, he'll be questioned by his own clients and he'll have a meeting, a briefing with them prior to make sure everything goes smoothly.
[01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:15.500]  And that's all fine and good.
[01:12:20.216 --> 01:12:22.178]  You guys don't think Mark Zuckerberg is a human?
[01:12:22.178 --> 01:12:26.782]  You think he's a walking android?
[01:12:26.782 --> 01:12:29.584]  Is Zuckerberg a human?
[01:12:29.584 --> 01:12:32.307]  Is that the top Google search for Zuckerberg?
[01:12:32.307 --> 01:12:36.090]  Is Zuckerberg?
[01:12:36.090 --> 01:12:42.796]  Guys, you should look at the hat that Priscilla Chan, his wife, wore when she arrived in D.C.
[01:12:42.796 --> 01:12:43.417]  Let me tell you something.
[01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:57.123]  These... Mark Zuckerberg and his wife are so socially inept and awkward that Zuckerberg literally hires a team of professionals to teach him how to be human.
[01:12:57.123 --> 01:12:59.444]  To teach him how to act human.
[01:12:59.444 --> 01:13:07.726]  He had a video, or tweet, he's bragging about how he walks like an android because it's better for his back.
[01:13:07.726 --> 01:13:09.587]  Who advised his wife to wear a hat
[01:13:13.032 --> 01:13:18.153]  That even the drunkest person at the Kentucky Derby would think is crazy.
[01:13:18.153 --> 01:13:20.414]  Who is advising these people?
[01:13:20.414 --> 01:13:42.038]  They're so socially awkward they have to have professional advice on how to seem normal so that the public might actually accept them, might actually like them, might actually not think they're the bad guy in this Facebook Cambridge Analytica deal.
[01:13:45.151 --> 01:13:52.294]  Well, I don't think anything's gonna come from this, and that was the question that I had yesterday.
[01:13:52.294 --> 01:13:53.454]  What happens to Facebook?
[01:13:53.454 --> 01:13:57.116]  What happens to Mark Zuckerberg?
[01:13:57.116 --> 01:14:00.137]  What legal precedence could be set from this?
[01:14:00.137 --> 01:14:02.178]  Are we looking at terms of service?
[01:14:02.178 --> 01:14:03.718]  Are we looking at data mining?
[01:14:03.718 --> 01:14:05.219]  It's gonna be nothing of that.
[01:14:05.219 --> 01:14:06.980]  This is gonna be a total softball.
[01:14:06.980 --> 01:14:10.721]  This is my expectation now.
[01:14:10.721 --> 01:14:12.262]  This is gonna be a total softball.
[01:14:13.379 --> 01:14:20.185]  Zuckerberg's gonna, yeah, admit, oh yeah, we sell your data, like nothing new, like we know this is going on.
[01:14:20.185 --> 01:14:24.529]  Oh yeah, we sold it, yeah, we helped, and that's what it'll turn into.
[01:14:24.529 --> 01:14:27.392]  Zuckerberg will basically be like, yep, yep, I won the election for Trump.
[01:14:27.392 --> 01:14:29.494]  It was me.
[01:14:29.494 --> 01:14:31.776]  It was me.
[01:14:31.776 --> 01:14:37.221]  It wasn't Trump, it wasn't the millions of people that went to his rallies, you know, it wasn't any of that.
[01:14:39.150 --> 01:14:40.750]  It wasn't the forgotten Americans.
[01:14:40.750 --> 01:14:42.451]  It wasn't the veterans.
[01:14:42.451 --> 01:14:44.651]  It wasn't the legal immigrants.
[01:14:44.651 --> 01:14:46.372]  It wasn't the working class.
[01:14:46.372 --> 01:14:46.732]  No, no, no.
[01:14:46.732 --> 01:14:48.372]  It was Zuckerberg.
[01:14:48.372 --> 01:14:50.872]  Zuckerberg did it all and he's going to go apologize today.
[01:14:50.872 --> 01:14:53.753]  That's what this is going to turn into.
[01:14:53.753 --> 01:14:55.814]  Oh yeah, we sold your data.
[01:14:55.814 --> 01:14:56.634]  Yeah, we did it.
[01:14:56.634 --> 01:15:02.315]  Here's how we sold it here and we sold it here and we've been doing this for this long and people have been using it for this and that.
[01:15:02.315 --> 01:15:06.616]  And it'll all conclude with, yep, I won the election for Trump.
[01:15:06.616 --> 01:15:07.416]  It was me and I'm sorry.
[01:15:08.945 --> 01:15:11.827]  It was me, Mark Zuckerberg, the human android.
[01:15:11.827 --> 01:15:12.387]  It was me.
[01:15:12.387 --> 01:15:13.487]  I won the election for Trump.
[01:15:13.487 --> 01:15:14.808]  Trump is a dummy.
[01:15:14.808 --> 01:15:16.429]  Trump is a buffoon.
[01:15:16.429 --> 01:15:19.270]  Trump couldn't have done it without me, Mark Zuckerberg, and Facebook.
[01:15:19.270 --> 01:15:20.491]  Period.
[01:15:20.491 --> 01:15:21.171]  And I'm sorry.
[01:15:21.171 --> 01:15:22.752]  And I'm sorry.
[01:15:22.752 --> 01:15:24.493]  But that's just how it went down.
[01:15:24.493 --> 01:15:25.494]  And I'm Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:15:25.494 --> 01:15:27.215]  And I put Trump in office.
[01:15:27.215 --> 01:15:29.376]  And I obviously regret it.
[01:15:29.376 --> 01:15:35.639]  I obviously regret that Russia giving me a couple thousand bucks and
[01:15:39.324 --> 01:15:41.505]  Okay, that just distracts me.
[01:15:41.505 --> 01:15:42.865]  I don't know what that was.
[01:15:42.865 --> 01:15:45.787]  That was a weird picture the crew just put on the screen there.
[01:15:45.787 --> 01:15:48.528]  Now I totally lost my train of thought.
[01:15:48.528 --> 01:15:49.248]  I don't know what's going on.
[01:15:49.248 --> 01:15:51.189]  Somebody call Mark Zuckerberg, get me back on track.
[01:15:51.189 --> 01:15:52.429]  Get me some data, Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:15:52.429 --> 01:15:53.790]  I'm losing it here.
[01:15:53.790 --> 01:15:56.151]  Zuckerberg put Trump in office, but he's going to apologize today.
[01:15:57.466 --> 01:15:58.206]  Face it.
[01:15:58.206 --> 01:16:01.067]  Today's electric power grid is more vulnerable than ever.

[01:17:28.404 --> 01:17:33.788]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[01:17:33.788 --> 01:17:36.690]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[01:17:36.690 --> 01:17:40.273]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.

[01:17:54.884 --> 01:17:56.045]  Faketv.com
[01:17:58.578 --> 01:18:01.600]  They use their media to assassinate Real News.
[01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:05.802]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[01:18:05.802 --> 01:18:12.506]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.
[01:18:12.506 --> 01:18:16.269]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance.
[01:18:16.969 --> 01:18:36.480]  All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding, until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[01:18:37.020 --> 01:18:41.142]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[01:18:41.142 --> 01:18:52.368]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom, is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[01:18:52.368 --> 01:18:57.491]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America, and I'm freedom's safest place.
[01:18:58.231 --> 01:19:01.972]  We need to fund this operation, ladies and gentlemen, and I make it really easy.
[01:19:01.972 --> 01:19:09.035]  We went out and looked at what the top nootropics, or brain pills, are that are healthy for energy, stamina, mental clarity, you name it.
[01:19:09.035 --> 01:19:13.777]  And we created a stronger formula than some of the best-selling formulas out there.
[01:19:13.777 --> 01:19:14.537]  It's very simple.
[01:19:14.537 --> 01:19:17.038]  We went out and looked at what is the top, what is the best.
[01:19:17.038 --> 01:19:18.979]  We'll just put even more product in, we'll make it better.
[01:19:18.979 --> 01:19:20.779]  Leading competitors put $2 a product in it, sell it for $60.
[01:19:20.779 --> 01:19:21.960]  We put $10 in it and sell it for $30.
[01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:22.680]  It's $19.95 right now.
[01:19:27.622 --> 01:19:30.683]  So you get an incredible top-of-the-line new Tropic for $19.95.
[01:19:30.683 --> 01:19:35.104]  Believe me, we're selling it for $35 on average.
[01:19:35.104 --> 01:19:38.964]  We need that $15, $20 we make to fund this operation in the face of the Globals, the rest of it.
[01:19:38.964 --> 01:19:42.825]  But I'm doing this because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks.
[01:19:42.825 --> 01:19:45.986]  I want to sell it all out before the big supply comes in.
[01:19:45.986 --> 01:19:49.626]  And I want people that haven't tried Brain Force to try it and find out why.
[01:19:49.626 --> 01:19:52.227]  It's got 6,000-plus five-star reviews.
[01:19:52.227 --> 01:19:53.247]  It's amazing.
[01:19:53.247 --> 01:19:55.668]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:20:01.832 --> 01:20:16.859]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:16.859 --> 01:20:18.039]  You found it.
[01:20:18.039 --> 01:20:20.100]  The tip of the spear.
[01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:24.983]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[01:20:24.983 --> 01:20:30.125]  If you take life, do you know what
[01:20:33.543 --> 01:20:37.326]  So I was kind of on a vacation over the weekend.
[01:20:37.326 --> 01:20:54.341]  I was out of town attending a friend's wedding in my hometown and when I when I go out of town I try to focus on not like actually getting away from everything mentally and just breaking from it so that you can kind of take a step away and see the forest again.
[01:20:55.441 --> 01:21:01.243]  And kind of have that re-energy, that re-energizing process of just getting back into it.
[01:21:01.243 --> 01:21:07.245]  But, you know, I'm sitting here and I'm looking at all this news.
[01:21:07.245 --> 01:21:12.587]  I'm looking at what's going on in Syria, where they don't even have to give you a reason.
[01:21:12.587 --> 01:21:15.808]  Oh yeah, Assad chemically gassed his people.
[01:21:15.808 --> 01:21:16.148]  Why?
[01:21:16.148 --> 01:21:18.869]  Well, don't ask why.
[01:21:18.869 --> 01:21:20.410]  Who asks why anymore?
[01:21:20.410 --> 01:21:21.310]  This is, it's 2018.
[01:21:21.310 --> 01:21:21.670]  Who asks why?
[01:21:26.072 --> 01:21:27.692]  Trump colluded with Russia.
[01:21:27.692 --> 01:21:28.032]  Why?
[01:21:28.032 --> 01:21:29.153]  Why?
[01:21:29.153 --> 01:21:32.113]  What are you, some kind of... Why?
[01:21:32.113 --> 01:21:35.154]  Nobody asks why, don't you realize?
[01:21:35.154 --> 01:21:36.735]  Why?
[01:21:36.735 --> 01:21:40.055]  Look at this conspiracy theorist over here asking why.
[01:21:40.055 --> 01:21:42.296]  Listen to this racist Nazi asking why.
[01:21:42.296 --> 01:21:43.856]  Oh, there's Assad.
[01:21:43.856 --> 01:21:44.516]  He's bad.
[01:21:44.516 --> 01:21:45.197]  I saw it on CNN.
[01:21:45.197 --> 01:21:46.197]  Assad bad.
[01:21:46.197 --> 01:21:48.277]  Crush Assad.
[01:21:51.854 --> 01:21:52.374]  Don't you see?
[01:21:52.374 --> 01:21:54.895]  Assad is stabilizing Syria.
[01:21:54.895 --> 01:21:57.235]  He must be stopped!
[01:21:57.235 --> 01:22:01.036]  Assad wants to have Christians and Jews and Muslims and everybody living in harmony.
[01:22:01.036 --> 01:22:02.656]  Just, you know, it's okay.
[01:22:02.656 --> 01:22:03.376]  Just do your thing.
[01:22:03.376 --> 01:22:04.336]  Just leave us alone.
[01:22:04.336 --> 01:22:07.437]  No!
[01:22:07.437 --> 01:22:10.877]  No!
[01:22:10.877 --> 01:22:15.278]  And so the media says, Assad gassed his own people.
[01:22:15.278 --> 01:22:16.258]  But they don't tell you why.
[01:22:16.258 --> 01:22:19.259]  They don't show you any evidence.
[01:22:20.523 --> 01:22:21.343]  This whole thing.
[01:22:21.343 --> 01:22:24.525]  I mean, you want to talk about a rollout?
[01:22:24.525 --> 01:22:36.152]  Nikki Haley tweets out, last June, if there's a chemical weapons attack in Syria, we're blaming Assad.
[01:22:36.152 --> 01:22:38.153]  You want to talk about uncouth?
[01:22:38.153 --> 01:22:41.375]  You want to talk about irresponsible?
[01:22:41.375 --> 01:22:45.377]  You want to talk about jumping the shark?
[01:22:45.377 --> 01:22:47.178]  Okay.
[01:22:47.178 --> 01:22:48.939]  If I die, Hillary Clinton killed me.
[01:22:51.906 --> 01:22:53.507]  That's crazy!
[01:22:53.507 --> 01:22:59.773]  If Alex Jones came on the air every day and said, if I die you know it was Hillary Clinton, if I die you know it was Hillary Clinton, the media would go insane!
[01:22:59.773 --> 01:23:02.035]  They'd say, how can you jump to that conclusion?
[01:23:02.035 --> 01:23:09.361]  Look at Alex Jones, he's a wild man, he's wacky, he blames something, he's blaming someone for something that hasn't even happened!
[01:23:09.361 --> 01:23:14.065]  But then Nikki Haley does that, the ambassador to the UN, should be a little more responsible,
[01:23:16.075 --> 01:23:21.258]  She says last June, if there's a chemical weapons attack in Syria, we're blaming Assad.
[01:23:21.258 --> 01:23:23.019]  So she tells you the whole plan.
[01:23:23.019 --> 01:23:25.980]  She tells you the whole layout.
[01:23:25.980 --> 01:23:35.205]  And then it happens, they blame Assad, and then they want intervention in Syria, and they're lining up ships and jets on the border.
[01:23:35.205 --> 01:23:39.507]  And the whole thing doesn't have a why, doesn't have any evidence.
[01:23:41.718 --> 01:23:46.361]  And then you think about it and the whys actually go in a different direction.
[01:23:46.361 --> 01:23:53.565]  Here's Ron Paul discussing how Assad gassing his own people doesn't make sense.
[01:23:54.724 --> 01:23:58.605]  I think the least likely would be Assad.
[01:23:58.605 --> 01:24:00.005]  This whole idea of Assad.
[01:24:00.005 --> 01:24:00.925]  And it's over and over again.
[01:24:00.925 --> 01:24:02.586]  I've probably heard it ten times today.
[01:24:02.586 --> 01:24:04.286]  Assad is gassing his own people.
[01:24:04.286 --> 01:24:06.646]  And they've said that every time it happens.
[01:24:06.646 --> 01:24:09.847]  And then a month or two later they prove it was absolutely wrong.
[01:24:09.847 --> 01:24:13.688]  So I cannot see any reason why Assad would do this.
[01:24:13.688 --> 01:24:15.808]  There's no reason for Russia to have done this.
[01:24:15.808 --> 01:24:18.309]  There's somebody who wants to stir up trouble.
[01:24:18.309 --> 01:24:20.169]  And the people who want us to stay there.
[01:24:20.589 --> 01:24:26.032]  So we're getting, let's say there's a hint, there's a bone thrown on, we might leave according to Trump.
[01:24:26.032 --> 01:24:28.192]  Well, no, we have to have a reason for staying.
[01:24:28.192 --> 01:24:29.633]  We're not going to let this happen.
[01:24:29.633 --> 01:24:31.154]  That's the problem.
[01:24:31.154 --> 01:24:35.436]  You know, the McCain's people say, oh, we left, we left Iraq too soon.
[01:24:35.436 --> 01:24:36.396]  And that's what happened.
[01:24:36.396 --> 01:24:37.937]  ISIS came in, of course.
[01:24:38.277 --> 01:24:44.040]  The evidence is pretty strong that we've been pretty friendly with ISIS and we use ISIS to try to fight our battle.
[01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:45.882]  So somebody wanted to stay there.
[01:24:45.882 --> 01:24:54.026]  I think the policy makers here did not want us to leave and somebody does it for them.
[01:24:54.026 --> 01:25:02.811]  But I just think this whole idea that all of a sudden Assad's gassing his own people I think is total nonsense.
[01:25:02.811 --> 01:25:03.512]  And that's the key.
[01:25:06.482 --> 01:25:08.103]  They don't want real solutions.
[01:25:08.103 --> 01:25:11.665]  Trump is a real person.
[01:25:11.665 --> 01:25:15.067]  He gets in, he wants real solutions.
[01:25:15.067 --> 01:25:26.615]  And that's kind of almost an Achilles heel of his because he can be twisted around and jacked around because he's actually looking for a real solution.
[01:25:26.615 --> 01:25:27.916]  But they don't want a solution.
[01:25:27.916 --> 01:25:30.397]  That's why they're jacking you around, President Trump.
[01:25:30.397 --> 01:25:32.659]  That's why they're false flagging in Syria, President Trump.
[01:25:35.495 --> 01:25:49.719]  That's why John Bolton's, I believe, his first day, his first day in the Trump administration, the chemical attack happens in Syria, and now we're calling for intervention, essentially, with troops on the border.
[01:25:49.719 --> 01:25:54.940]  Guys, actually, see if you can... I'm pretty sure yesterday was his first official day.
[01:25:54.940 --> 01:26:02.382]  Yeah, it was.
[01:26:02.382 --> 01:26:03.362]  I mean, oh, man.
[01:26:04.669 --> 01:26:10.894]  See... It's like... Grass is green.
[01:26:10.894 --> 01:26:13.396]  Water is wet.
[01:26:13.396 --> 01:26:15.877]  You need oxygen to live.
[01:26:15.877 --> 01:26:20.000]  John Bolton's first day in office and there's a chemical attack in Syria.
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:24.544]  Of course there is!
[01:26:24.544 --> 01:26:27.426]  And I gave John Bolton the benefit of the doubt.
[01:26:27.426 --> 01:26:28.506]  But we had the guests.
[01:26:28.506 --> 01:26:29.527]  We had the experts.
[01:26:29.527 --> 01:26:30.628]  They knew who Bolton was.
[01:26:30.628 --> 01:26:31.929]  They told us.
[01:26:31.929 --> 01:26:32.469]  They told you.
[01:26:32.469 --> 01:26:33.170]  They were right.
[01:26:35.503 --> 01:26:36.324]  Total warmonger.
[01:26:36.324 --> 01:26:37.184]  He's the walrus.
[01:26:37.184 --> 01:26:40.167]  He's the war walrus.
[01:26:40.167 --> 01:26:45.911]  John Bolton, the war walrus.
[01:26:45.911 --> 01:26:49.594]  Now, let's go to Tucker Carlson.
[01:26:49.594 --> 01:26:51.875]  I mean, here's Fox News.
[01:26:51.875 --> 01:26:58.801]  Even Fox News is like, hey, you know, before we jump to conclusions on Syria, maybe let's actually look at some evidence.
[01:27:00.475 --> 01:27:15.368]  And now the same people who brought you a dying American middle class, undefended American borders, and endless pointless wars in countries you could not find on a map, are telling the President he's got to depose Assad for reasons that are both unclear and demonstrably dishonest.
[01:27:16.297 --> 01:27:17.979]  And by the way, it may happen.
[01:27:17.979 --> 01:27:21.643]  But before it does, Congress ought to consider a brand new constitutional amendment.
[01:27:21.643 --> 01:27:24.125]  Let's call it the Lindsey Graham Amendment.
[01:27:24.125 --> 01:27:25.507]  And here's what it would say.
[01:27:25.507 --> 01:27:31.012]  Congress shall topple no government until it finishes rebuilding the last government it toppled.
[01:27:31.012 --> 01:27:38.280]  And furthermore, talk show generals shall be required to personally visit the battlefield of every war they advocate for.
[01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:38.861]  End of amendment.
[01:27:40.930 --> 01:27:47.654]  That might end some of the fake news and fake wars that we get pushed into as well.
[01:27:47.654 --> 01:27:49.475]  But of course they don't want that.
[01:27:49.475 --> 01:27:51.016]  They don't want solutions.
[01:27:51.016 --> 01:27:53.818]  If you have a solution, the gravy train stops.
[01:27:53.818 --> 01:27:55.379]  You see how that works?
[01:27:55.379 --> 01:27:56.659]  Mm-hmm.
[01:27:56.659 --> 01:27:59.961]  Yeah.
[01:27:59.961 --> 01:28:07.146]  And... If they think there's a peaceful resolution to intervention in Syria,
[01:28:08.663 --> 01:28:11.989]  They are sadly mistaken, but they know there's not.
[01:28:11.989 --> 01:28:15.956]  They want war with Iran and Russia, and they know that Syria is the hotbed to do that.
[01:28:17.438 --> 01:28:23.340]  And so now you have Zero Hedge, which again was our story, gets the drudge link, not us who broke it.
[01:28:23.340 --> 01:28:25.241]  But that's fine, we broke the story.
[01:28:25.241 --> 01:28:27.401]  Zero Hedge gets the drudge link, it's all good.
[01:28:27.401 --> 01:28:27.741]  U.S.
[01:28:27.741 --> 01:28:33.563]  Navy destroyer armed with tomahawks arrives off Syrian coast, harassed by Russian warplanes.
[01:28:33.563 --> 01:28:37.445]  Well, we had the story yesterday, we reported it right here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:28:37.445 --> 01:28:39.185]  Russia says it warned U.S.
[01:28:39.185 --> 01:28:41.886]  of grave repercussions if Syria attacked.
[01:28:41.886 --> 01:28:43.887]  Russia is jamming American drones in Syria.
[01:28:43.887 --> 01:28:45.047]  So here you go!
[01:28:45.047 --> 01:28:46.788]  Here's that war you wanted with Syria!
[01:28:48.797 --> 01:28:54.090]  You know, John Kerry said that we got all the chemical weapons out of there, but it's definitely Assad.
[01:28:54.090 --> 01:28:56.155]  Even though we said that they didn't have chemical weapons, it's them.
[01:28:57.307 --> 01:28:58.188]  It's a no-brainer.
[01:28:58.188 --> 01:29:00.609]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[01:29:00.609 --> 01:29:08.735]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?

[01:29:58.604 --> 01:30:04.928]  InfoWars Life BrainForce Plus is our number one selling product by leaps and bounds, and for a good reason.
[01:30:04.928 --> 01:30:13.333]  Going back about five years ago, we did research on what top-selling nootropics were, what were most popular, what were best, what people liked, and we made it even stronger.
[01:30:13.333 --> 01:30:18.417]  Then we cut the price because leading competitors have five to seven times markup.
[01:30:18.417 --> 01:30:19.157]  We only have 150%.
[01:30:19.157 --> 01:30:20.258]  Then it helps fund our operation.
[01:30:22.139 --> 01:30:24.960]  Well, now it's 50% off.
[01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:33.404]  That means we've got a 25% markup, and we've got it paired with the real red pill that takes about 7 days to kick in.
[01:30:33.404 --> 01:30:35.205]  Rainforest takes about 30 minutes.
[01:30:35.205 --> 01:30:36.706]  But the two go together.
[01:30:36.706 --> 01:30:38.727]  It's the Mind and Body Challenge.
[01:30:38.727 --> 01:30:47.651]  They're both 50% off individually, or together they're 50% off, and free shipping with the combo at InfoHorseLife.com.
[01:30:48.211 --> 01:30:53.399]  But it's got to end in a couple days because both of these bestsellers are about to sell out.
[01:30:53.399 --> 01:30:58.386]  InfoWarsLife.com to get your Brain Force Plus and real red pill today.
[01:30:58.386 --> 01:31:03.093]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60 plus products, we have an InfoWarsLife.
[01:31:03.914 --> 01:31:04.835]  They take hours.
[01:31:04.835 --> 01:31:07.277]  MycoZX Plus, it now has a lower price.
[01:31:07.277 --> 01:31:08.457]  It's stronger.
[01:31:08.457 --> 01:31:10.059]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[01:31:10.059 --> 01:31:13.281]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[01:31:13.281 --> 01:31:14.402]  It's back in stock.
[01:31:14.402 --> 01:31:17.584]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.
[01:31:17.584 --> 01:31:21.367]  It's got the preglanone, that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[01:31:21.367 --> 01:31:24.469]  Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins, the amino acids.
[01:31:24.469 --> 01:31:25.350]  So you can upload it.
[01:31:25.350 --> 01:31:30.974]  And our latest product that goes great with the Super Blue Colloidal Silver and Iodine Fortified Toothpaste.
[01:31:31.574 --> 01:31:34.497]  is super blue silver immune gargle.
[01:31:34.497 --> 01:31:35.457]  That's a spray you do.
[01:31:35.457 --> 01:31:36.738]  You can also swallow it.
[01:31:36.738 --> 01:31:42.083]  It's a supplement with iodine, super high quality silver, and a lot more.
[01:31:42.083 --> 01:31:43.484]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[01:31:43.484 --> 01:31:53.392]  So thank you all for remembering InfoWareStore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake, and it's so essential to spread the word.
[01:31:53.392 --> 01:31:56.455]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[01:31:57.825 --> 01:32:01.427]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[01:32:01.427 --> 01:32:03.188]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[01:32:03.188 --> 01:32:14.474]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[01:32:15.234 --> 01:32:24.444]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[01:32:24.444 --> 01:32:30.390]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[01:32:30.390 --> 01:32:35.495]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[01:32:35.495 --> 01:32:37.738]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[01:32:38.098 --> 01:32:39.839]  It is not an antihistamine.
[01:32:39.839 --> 01:32:49.807]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[01:32:49.807 --> 01:32:52.469]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[01:32:52.469 --> 01:33:01.376]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[01:33:01.376 --> 01:33:04.058]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:09.800 --> 01:33:17.484]  So I've got all kinds of big news that we've been covering today.
[01:33:17.484 --> 01:33:22.046]  Zuckerberg set to testify before his clients, excuse me, I mean Congress.
[01:33:39.622 --> 01:33:41.022]  Today, he's not under oath.
[01:33:41.022 --> 01:33:42.063]  How convenient for him.
[01:33:42.063 --> 01:33:51.785]  Of course, you've got the deep state and the globalists trying to start World War III by intervening in Syria.
[01:33:51.785 --> 01:33:55.626]  And you've got Alex Jones in the swamp in D.C.
[01:33:55.626 --> 01:34:04.729]  addressing the press at the National Press Club today about the attacks on the First Amendment and the frivolous lawsuit against us to try to censor us and bring us down.
[01:34:08.595 --> 01:34:26.340]  But I need to cover a different story real quick here because this is something that is so sick, so twisted, you really can't even believe that this would happen.
[01:34:26.340 --> 01:34:30.602]  And the reason I'm gonna cover this is for a couple reasons.
[01:34:30.602 --> 01:34:34.523]  One is it shows you the mindset of some of the judges
[01:34:37.059 --> 01:34:51.964]  That we have currently in the judicial system, and it shows you the depravity and the filth that our youth are coming up in, that are creating monsters.
[01:34:51.964 --> 01:34:55.645]  Total monsters.
[01:34:55.645 --> 01:35:04.308]  So the story is, two men who raped Colorado Springs 13-year-old get probation, not prison.
[01:35:06.297 --> 01:35:20.208]  So the story is a 13-year-old girl got tied down to a bed and raped by six men aged 13 to 21.
[01:35:20.208 --> 01:35:22.169]  Did you hear what I just said?
[01:35:22.169 --> 01:35:29.354]  Six men tied down a 13-year-old girl and raped her!
[01:35:29.354 --> 01:35:32.697]  And they're not going to jail.
[01:35:32.697 --> 01:35:34.038]  They're getting probation.
[01:35:37.426 --> 01:35:39.628]  A 13-year-old girl.
[01:35:39.628 --> 01:35:41.429]  Now listen to this.
[01:35:41.429 --> 01:35:55.119]  You've got the defense attacking the victim, saying, well, she was using marijuana, she had run away from home, she was troubled, she had something to do with this.
[01:35:55.119 --> 01:35:59.263]  She's 13, you sick freak!
[01:35:59.263 --> 01:36:06.128]  You ought to be disbarred for attacking the victim, a rape victim, of six men, tying her to a bed!
[01:36:08.325 --> 01:36:13.106]  Now, side note for a second.
[01:36:13.106 --> 01:36:15.426]  Where's the liberal media?
[01:36:15.426 --> 01:36:16.907]  Where's the Women's March?
[01:36:16.907 --> 01:36:18.307]  Where's the Me Too?
[01:36:18.307 --> 01:36:25.068]  Six men tie down a 13-year-old girl to a bed and rape her and you get nothing?
[01:36:25.068 --> 01:36:26.929]  Nothing from CNN?
[01:36:26.929 --> 01:36:28.769]  Nothing from the Women's Marchers?
[01:36:28.769 --> 01:36:30.490]  Nothing from the Me Too movement?
[01:36:30.490 --> 01:36:32.490]  Because they're a bunch of frauds, that's why.
[01:36:33.868 --> 01:36:38.889]  Because they take their marching orders from CNN and MSNBC and they're not covering it!
[01:36:38.889 --> 01:36:39.489]  That's why!
[01:36:39.489 --> 01:36:43.390]  Now why aren't they covering it?
[01:36:43.390 --> 01:36:48.752]  Could it have something to do with the assailant's skin color?
[01:36:48.752 --> 01:36:49.892]  I don't know.
[01:36:49.892 --> 01:36:53.393]  But they're not going to cover it.
[01:36:53.393 --> 01:36:57.614]  And the rapists aren't going to go to jail.
[01:36:57.614 --> 01:37:01.735]  So you can thank Colorado District Judge
[01:37:02.788 --> 01:37:04.348]  Michael McHenry.
[01:37:04.348 --> 01:37:15.412]  You can thank him for making sure that rapists that tied down a 13-year-old girl are on probation instead of going to prison.
[01:37:15.412 --> 01:37:21.793]  Make sure you thank Judge Michael McHenry in the 4th Judicial District of Colorado.
[01:37:21.793 --> 01:37:27.115]  Make sure you thank him for keeping those animals on the street!
[01:37:30.242 --> 01:37:40.267]  If you, so here's my, so okay, so you've got a lawyer that's gonna attack the victim and stand up for six men that tied a girl down and raped her.
[01:37:40.267 --> 01:37:46.830]  Then you've got a judge that's gonna hear their plea bargain and say, you get probation, not jail.
[01:37:46.830 --> 01:37:53.653]  And then the lawyer says, well, you have to give, so they came in waves, two guys on trial, two guys on trial.
[01:37:53.653 --> 01:37:58.916]  Now two more guys are awaiting their, to figure out if they're gonna be on probation or stay in trial.
[01:37:59.716 --> 01:38:02.718]  And you know what the defense is saying?
[01:38:02.718 --> 01:38:05.239]  You can't put the girl up on the stand again.
[01:38:05.239 --> 01:38:07.400]  The judge says you can't put the girl up on the stand again.
[01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:09.101]  It's too traumatizing for her.
[01:38:09.101 --> 01:38:12.664]  For her to have to recount this and go through it is too traumatizing.
[01:38:12.664 --> 01:38:17.386]  Well, how do you think the actual rape was?
[01:38:17.386 --> 01:38:19.568]  This makes me sick.
[01:38:19.568 --> 01:38:28.893]  So thank Judge Michael McHenry for making sure that if you want to tie a girl down, 13-year-old girl down to a bed and rape her, that you're just going to get some probation.
[01:38:31.032 --> 01:38:38.838]  You're just gonna get some probation.
[01:38:38.838 --> 01:38:42.001]  That is about the sickest thing.
[01:38:42.001 --> 01:38:44.523]  Total silence from the mainstream news.
[01:38:44.523 --> 01:38:46.365]  Total silence from the Me Too movement.
[01:38:46.365 --> 01:38:53.070]  Total silence from the Women's March.
[01:38:53.070 --> 01:38:56.893]  It's sick to me.
[01:38:56.893 --> 01:38:58.975]  I mean, if that doesn't make you sick,
[01:39:02.168 --> 01:39:08.290]  And you know what the sad thing is?
[01:39:08.290 --> 01:39:15.191]  Everyone involved in this is obviously very troubled.
[01:39:15.191 --> 01:39:21.013]  And it's because of the decay of our society, the decay of the education system, the decay of the family.
[01:39:21.013 --> 01:39:29.375]  That's the only reason that you even have a situation where these men, who are young guys, I think the oldest was 21, age 17 to 21, young guys,
[01:39:33.148 --> 01:39:41.034]  Who you would think would understand that, I mean, what you're doing right now should destroy your life forever.
[01:39:41.034 --> 01:39:43.256]  You belong in jail.
[01:39:43.256 --> 01:39:44.197]  Forever.
[01:39:44.197 --> 01:39:46.038]  For this.
[01:39:46.038 --> 01:39:53.784]  But then they've been raised in such a decayed society.
[01:39:53.784 --> 01:39:57.487]  Who knows where their families are, where their parents are, if they're going to school.
[01:40:00.325 --> 01:40:10.883]  And they've become so decayed, they've become so poisoned by the culture, by the society, that they have it in their minds to tie a girl down and rape her on a bed, a 13-year-old.
[01:40:13.663 --> 01:40:16.627]  That's how sick and twisted our society has become.
[01:40:16.627 --> 01:40:31.304]  And then, you find out it's even worse than you originally thought, because the judge says, you're not going to prison, you're gonna be on probation, and you have a lawyer, a defense attorney, that's going to attack the victim to try to get the rapist off.
[01:40:42.136 --> 01:40:45.238]  Seriously, this is so heartbreaking because on so many different levels.
[01:40:45.238 --> 01:40:49.280]  Again, it's heartbreaking because this is the decay of society.
[01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:50.040]  It's heartbreaking.
[01:40:50.040 --> 01:40:52.121]  It's the decay of the justice system.
[01:40:52.121 --> 01:40:56.343]  I mean, it's just it's just total cultural rot.
[01:40:56.343 --> 01:41:04.007]  Total cultural degradation.
[01:41:04.007 --> 01:41:06.788]  So thank Michael McHenry.
[01:41:06.788 --> 01:41:10.070]  The fourth district judge in Colorado for making sure that those young men.
[01:41:12.156 --> 01:41:15.219]  Are on probation and not in jail.
[01:41:15.219 --> 01:41:19.803]  You think they learned a lesson from that?
[01:41:19.803 --> 01:41:26.609]  How much you want to bet right now that half those guys end up in jail someday?
[01:41:26.609 --> 01:41:27.810]  If not all of them.
[01:41:27.810 --> 01:41:32.614]  Because they didn't learn their lesson.
[01:41:32.614 --> 01:41:36.557]  Because they didn't learn their lesson.
[01:41:36.557 --> 01:41:37.138]  It's sick to me.
[01:41:39.721 --> 01:42:02.716]  I honestly can't even imagine sitting in that courtroom, Michael McHenry's courtroom, hearing about a gang rape of a 13-year-old tied to a bed, and you don't think they need to see some prison time?
[01:42:02.716 --> 01:42:05.598]  You think probation is the answer?
[01:42:05.598 --> 01:42:07.399]  And this is the liberal mindset?
[01:42:09.141 --> 01:42:11.943]  This is the liberal pipe dream.
[01:42:11.943 --> 01:42:20.167]  And then these individuals are probably going to go right back out on the street and commit some other heinous act and end up in jail.
[01:42:20.167 --> 01:42:21.488]  And it'll be even worse.
[01:42:21.488 --> 01:42:23.629]  And there'll be even more victims.
[01:42:23.629 --> 01:42:25.850]  That's what liberalism does.
[01:42:25.850 --> 01:42:29.912]  That's what these judges do.
[01:42:29.912 --> 01:42:32.334]  And nobody wins.
[01:42:32.334 --> 01:42:34.134]  Society loses.
[01:42:34.134 --> 01:42:35.835]  The victim loses.
[01:42:35.835 --> 01:42:38.477]  The perps lose because they end up worse off.
[01:42:40.114 --> 01:42:41.054]  Just an overall loss.
[01:42:41.054 --> 01:42:46.636]  So great job, Judge Michael McHenry in the 4th Judicial District of Colorado.
[01:42:46.636 --> 01:42:47.297]  Great job.
[01:42:47.297 --> 01:42:48.457]  You just had a 360 loss.
[01:42:48.457 --> 01:42:50.438]  You are a total loser.

[01:44:58.243 --> 01:45:01.985]  We need to fund this operation, ladies and gentlemen, and I make it really easy.
[01:45:01.985 --> 01:45:09.048]  We went out and looked at what the top nootropics or brain pills are that are healthy for energy, stamina, mental clarity, you name it.
[01:45:09.048 --> 01:45:13.810]  And we created a stronger formula than some of the best-selling formulas out there.
[01:45:13.810 --> 01:45:14.551]  It's very simple.
[01:45:14.551 --> 01:45:17.052]  We went out and looked at what is the top, what is the best.
[01:45:17.052 --> 01:45:18.993]  We'll just put even more product in, we'll make it better.
[01:45:18.993 --> 01:45:22.675]  Leading competitors put $2 a product in it, sell it for $60.
[01:45:22.675 --> 01:45:24.836]  We put $10 in it and sell it for $30.
[01:45:24.836 --> 01:45:25.436]  It's $19.95 right now.
[01:45:27.657 --> 01:45:30.699]  So you get an incredible top-of-the-line new Tropic for $19.95.
[01:45:30.699 --> 01:45:35.122]  Believe me, we're selling it for $35 on average.
[01:45:35.122 --> 01:45:38.985]  We need that $15, $20 we make to fund this operation in the face of the Globals, the rest of it.
[01:45:38.985 --> 01:45:42.847]  But I'm doing this because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks.
[01:45:42.847 --> 01:45:46.009]  I want to sell it all out before the big supply comes in.
[01:45:46.009 --> 01:45:49.652]  And I want people that haven't tried Brain Force to try it and find out why.

[01:46:03.338 --> 01:46:06.199]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[01:46:06.199 --> 01:46:08.179]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[01:46:08.179 --> 01:46:13.180]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[01:46:13.180 --> 01:46:15.300]  Research across the board is clear.
[01:46:15.300 --> 01:46:16.580]  In fact, it's certified.
[01:46:16.580 --> 01:46:21.701]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[01:46:21.701 --> 01:46:25.042]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants.
[01:46:25.202 --> 01:46:25.722]  We're good to go!
[01:46:52.816 --> 01:46:54.218]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:17.420 --> 01:47:24.466]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:24.466 --> 01:47:31.592]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:47:31.592 --> 01:47:37.116]  Truly a sick, twisted society we live in.
[01:47:37.116 --> 01:47:45.223]  Where judges let violent rapists of young girls walk with just probation and not prison time.
[01:47:46.374 --> 01:48:05.138]  Where the FBI can now be used for the benefit of a porn star's litigation to the determinant of this country and the president's agenda.
[01:48:05.138 --> 01:48:08.819]  I don't know where the frustration comes.
[01:48:08.819 --> 01:48:09.899]  Is the frustration that
[01:48:11.633 --> 01:48:15.716]  That society has decayed this much and that we're even at this point?
[01:48:15.716 --> 01:48:18.258]  Is that the frustration?
[01:48:18.258 --> 01:48:29.146]  Or is the frustration instinctually knowing from your lineage and your DNA that it's never going to change?
[01:48:29.146 --> 01:48:32.889]  It's never going to change.
[01:48:32.889 --> 01:48:35.731]  Society is always going to be sick and twisted.
[01:48:40.134 --> 01:48:57.468]  And if, I mean, you know, if this can go on and you can make up lies about chemical attacks in Syria to start World War III and not give any reason as to why or any evidence, you just get to make it up because you want to go to war.
[01:48:57.468 --> 01:48:59.950]  World War III, millions of people would die.
[01:48:59.950 --> 01:49:02.812]  So, you know, just make up lies to get that agenda going.
[01:49:02.812 --> 01:49:04.754]  Yeah.
[01:49:06.744 --> 01:49:14.229]  It's really depressing.
[01:49:14.229 --> 01:49:25.776]  And then you think about the trivial shit, excuse me, dump that, that we have to deal with here, and it's just like, man, I mean, it's insane, dude.
[01:49:25.776 --> 01:49:27.317]  It's honestly insane.
[01:49:27.317 --> 01:49:31.080]  Let me hit some of this news.
[01:49:31.080 --> 01:49:32.401]  I rarely ever cuss on air.
[01:49:32.401 --> 01:49:35.182]  That just really tells you where my head is at right now.
[01:49:35.182 --> 01:49:36.023]  I just can't even believe it.
[01:49:37.228 --> 01:49:38.329]  I can't even believe it.
[01:49:38.329 --> 01:49:43.594]  Every human being should be outraged at the nonsense we're dealing with.
[01:49:43.594 --> 01:49:52.182]  But, you know, Kim Kardashian or something is more important than calling out another false flag in Syria.
[01:49:52.182 --> 01:49:56.006]  You know, whatever.
[01:49:56.006 --> 01:49:57.207]  Screw the country!
[01:49:57.207 --> 01:50:02.572]  Stormy Daniels, she can't get the documents from Trump's attorney, so send the FBI in there.
[01:50:03.697 --> 01:50:06.018]  Yeah yeah, Mueller will take care of that.
[01:50:06.018 --> 01:50:11.202]  Yeah yeah, Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg did the exact same thing for Obama that they did for Trump.
[01:50:11.202 --> 01:50:14.123]  He was a hero then, now he's the bad guy.
[01:50:14.123 --> 01:50:15.604]  Get it yet?
[01:50:15.604 --> 01:50:17.365]  No, you don't.
[01:50:17.365 --> 01:50:18.886]  So we keep going!
[01:50:18.886 --> 01:50:19.847]  And we keep going!
[01:50:19.847 --> 01:50:20.747]  And we keep going!
[01:50:20.747 --> 01:50:21.448]  And we keep going!
[01:50:21.448 --> 01:50:23.449]  And it just, it feels like insanity now!
[01:50:24.696 --> 01:50:31.183]  It feels like insanity to actually care about humanity, to actually care about the future, to actually care about your country.
[01:50:31.183 --> 01:50:33.506]  It's insanity now.
[01:50:33.506 --> 01:50:37.630]  It's insanity to care because it's never going to stop.
[01:50:37.630 --> 01:50:44.358]  It's insane for me to actually care about people when you've got a judge that lets rapists walk.
[01:50:46.021 --> 01:50:48.922]  With just probation instead of prison time.
[01:50:48.922 --> 01:50:52.003]  It's insane for me to care about the future of this country.
[01:50:52.003 --> 01:51:00.505]  It's insane for me to care about the future of Earth when you can make things up to start World War III that will kill a million people.
[01:51:00.505 --> 01:51:01.986]  Why should I care?
[01:51:01.986 --> 01:51:07.427]  Why don't I just throw it all away and just go hang out and go watch a ballgame or something?
[01:51:07.427 --> 01:51:09.068]  Because no one else cares!
[01:51:11.226 --> 01:51:12.887]  Why should we care?
[01:51:12.887 --> 01:51:17.751]  So we're insane now, we're insane because we care about the future.
[01:51:17.751 --> 01:51:21.674]  We're insane because we care about humanity.
[01:51:21.674 --> 01:51:33.543]  We're insane because we want to have a debate over the GMOs that in every lab test with rats, by the third generation is growing tumors and is deformed, but we eat them voluntarily every day without even warning.
[01:51:34.983 --> 01:51:37.147]  It's insane for me to care about that.
[01:51:37.147 --> 01:51:41.215]  It's insane for us to care about the vaccines that are poisoning our youth.
[01:51:44.127 --> 01:51:45.368]  It's just, I could go on and on.
[01:51:45.368 --> 01:51:48.689]  The fluoride in the water, I mean, this is a joke!
[01:51:48.689 --> 01:51:50.050]  This is a joke!
[01:51:50.050 --> 01:51:56.893]  Here we are, humans, created by God, put on this planet, we can build rocket ships!
[01:51:56.893 --> 01:51:58.373]  We can build machines!
[01:51:58.373 --> 01:52:00.915]  We can communicate with people halfway around the world!
[01:52:00.915 --> 01:52:03.356]  Hell, we can communicate with people in space!
[01:52:03.356 --> 01:52:04.816]  We can travel to the stars!
[01:52:04.816 --> 01:52:06.537]  We can find out the secrets of the universe!
[01:52:06.537 --> 01:52:12.360]  And we're sitting here talking about Kim Kardashian's butt and starting World War III over a lie in Syria!
[01:52:13.399 --> 01:52:21.043]  And I'm supposed to care every day while people on CNN and MSNBC lie to the general public.
[01:52:21.043 --> 01:52:30.248]  And all the entertainment is just sent out there to brainwash the masses so that they don't care about their future.
[01:52:30.248 --> 01:52:32.930]  Same thing with cell phone use.
[01:52:32.930 --> 01:52:34.611]  Hey!
[01:52:34.611 --> 01:52:37.752]  You just found out that the cell phones are causing cancer.
[01:52:37.752 --> 01:52:39.674]  Are you going to change the way you use them?
[01:52:39.674 --> 01:52:41.775]  Nah!
[01:52:41.775 --> 01:52:42.015]  No!
[01:52:45.520 --> 01:52:49.343]  Okay.
[01:52:49.343 --> 01:52:55.026]  Anyway.
[01:52:55.026 --> 01:52:59.549]  The story is from John Rappaport at Infowars.com.
[01:52:59.549 --> 01:53:00.010]  The U.S.
[01:53:00.010 --> 01:53:03.312]  government colludes in mass deaths by opioids.
[01:53:08.953 --> 01:53:09.873]  But you know what?
[01:53:09.873 --> 01:53:11.514]  You know what, guys?
[01:53:11.514 --> 01:53:14.276]  We need to do something about marijuana, okay?
[01:53:14.276 --> 01:53:17.117]  We need to do something about heroin, okay?
[01:53:17.117 --> 01:53:21.499]  We need to do something about the meth on the streets, okay?
[01:53:21.499 --> 01:53:30.784]  Yeah, even though pharmaceutical drugs, by the CDC's own numbers,
[01:53:33.157 --> 01:53:44.688]  Make up more deaths in this country than heroin, cocaine, meth, and marijuana combined.
[01:53:44.688 --> 01:53:48.912]  But what industry does the government target?
[01:53:48.912 --> 01:53:54.237]  Not big pharmaceutical, but the black market drug industry.
[01:53:56.693 --> 01:54:04.256]  Not Big Pharma that rakes in money hand over fist and is regulated and killing more people than the black market drug industry.
[01:54:04.256 --> 01:54:04.976]  No.
[01:54:04.976 --> 01:54:07.277]  Not them.
[01:54:07.277 --> 01:54:13.139]  And Trump's talked a big game about this.
[01:54:13.139 --> 01:54:14.500]  So that's, yeah, that's nice.
[01:54:14.500 --> 01:54:17.121]  Let's just pump more drugs into our children.
[01:54:17.121 --> 01:54:20.242]  Let's just pump more drugs into our children, pump more vaccines.
[01:54:21.360 --> 01:54:23.521]  You know, I mean, who cares, right?
[01:54:23.521 --> 01:54:32.245]  Eventually they're just going to plug their mind into a memory chip, into some computer hub, and live in the cloud.
[01:54:32.245 --> 01:54:37.928]  And they'll call it heaven.
[01:54:37.928 --> 01:54:40.590]  Okay.
[01:54:40.590 --> 01:54:42.591]  This is from Bill Gertz at Free Beacon.
[01:54:42.591 --> 01:54:46.373]  Military set for cyber attacks on foreign infrastructure.
[01:54:47.709 --> 01:54:49.250]  So, okay, the U.S.
[01:54:49.250 --> 01:54:59.917]  is now intruding on foreign networks to deter China and Russia, and then we sit here and bitch and moan about Russia cyber-hacking us while we're doing it to everyone else.
[01:54:59.917 --> 01:55:09.783]  It's the end of the world if Russia buys up some Facebook advertising, and we call that hacking an election, meddling, but then we actually have
[01:55:11.420 --> 01:55:22.122]  Agendas and policies and technology and wings of the government actually engage in this cyber hacking.
[01:55:22.122 --> 01:55:26.443]  And that's just what we do.
[01:55:26.443 --> 01:55:28.844]  It's all madness, folks.
[01:55:28.844 --> 01:55:31.945]  Paul Joseph Watson is about to take over for me.
[01:55:31.945 --> 01:55:35.205]  Alex Jones, of course, is in D.C.
[01:55:35.205 --> 01:55:37.946]  I think, does he return Thursday, guys?
[01:55:37.946 --> 01:55:38.346]  Do we know?
[01:55:40.199 --> 01:55:40.580]  Thursday.
[01:55:40.580 --> 01:55:42.783]  Okay, so Alex Jones will be back in studio Thursday.
[01:55:42.783 --> 01:55:48.451]  I think I might be here with you guys tomorrow as well as perhaps some other guests.
[01:55:48.451 --> 01:55:53.018]  Don't forget Thursday we have the Stop the Collapse of America live broadcast.
[01:55:55.215 --> 01:56:01.101]  I haven't even been going on these rants to try to plug this broadcast, but I mean, how timely is that?
[01:56:01.101 --> 01:56:07.268]  The collapse of America, the collapse of humanity, it's a 34-hour live broadcast on Thursday.
[01:56:07.268 --> 01:56:09.931]  Runs from Thursday, April 12th to Friday, April 13th.
[01:56:11.212 --> 01:56:27.923]  Of course the live streams will be available at InfoWars.com slash show starts Friday April 12th with David Knight in the morning and it concludes excuse me Thursday April 12th and then concludes Friday April 13th oh Friday the 13th it concludes with myself and the war room at 6 p.m.
[01:56:27.923 --> 01:56:35.748]  Central which I'm about to break and then I will be going to host the war room at 3 o'clock Paul Joseph Watson takes over for me Zuckerberg about to testify before Congress
[01:56:36.908 --> 01:56:38.490]  So these are all the moving parts.
[01:56:38.490 --> 01:56:44.315]  This is what we do at InfoWars now, and it's all possible with your support at InfoWarsStore.com.

[01:57:21.289 --> 01:57:24.331]  If you haven't tried the new Super Blue Immune Gargle Combo,
[01:57:25.231 --> 01:57:28.593]  That is a great new product we have at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:57:28.593 --> 01:57:31.935]  That is also 50% off.
[01:57:31.935 --> 01:57:34.456]  Alright, I sign off of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:57:34.456 --> 01:57:35.737]  Paul Joseph Watson takes over.
[01:57:35.737 --> 01:57:38.018]  You can catch me later on The War Room at 3 o'clock.
[01:57:38.018 --> 01:57:47.243]  Paul Joseph Watson, he's got Syrian Girl, he's got other news to cover, and he takes over the Alex Jones Show.
[01:57:47.243 --> 01:57:49.464]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide, go ahead.
[01:57:50.388 --> 01:57:52.309]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[01:57:52.309 --> 01:58:02.832]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[01:58:02.832 --> 01:58:06.193]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks.
[01:58:06.633 --> 01:58:06.913]  Absolutely.
[01:58:29.419 --> 01:58:42.328]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[01:58:48.385 --> 01:58:54.691]  InfoWars Life BrainForce Plus is our number one selling product by leaps and bounds and for a good reason.
[01:58:54.691 --> 01:59:03.119]  Going back about five years ago, we did research on what top selling nootropics were, what were most popular, what were best, what people liked, and we made it even stronger.
[01:59:03.119 --> 01:59:07.803]  Then we cut the price because leading competitors have five to seven times markup.
[01:59:08.163 --> 01:59:11.904]  We only have 150% and then it helps fund our operation.
[01:59:11.904 --> 01:59:14.725]  Well, now it's 50% off.
[01:59:14.725 --> 01:59:23.147]  That means we've got a 25% markup and we've got it paired with the real red pill that takes about 7 days to kick in.
[01:59:23.147 --> 01:59:24.987]  Brain Force takes about 30 minutes.
[01:59:24.987 --> 01:59:26.467]  But the two go together.
[01:59:26.467 --> 01:59:28.508]  It's the mind and body challenge.
[01:59:28.508 --> 01:59:37.650]  They're both 50% off individually or together they're 50% off and free shipping with the combo at InfoHorseLife.com.
[01:59:37.990 --> 01:59:43.173]  But it's got to end in a couple days, because both of these bestsellers are about to sell out.
[01:59:43.173 --> 01:59:51.378]  InfoWarsLive.com to get your Brain Force Plus and Real Red Pill today!
[01:59:51.378 --> 01:59:53.979]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:59:58.032 --> 02:00:01.435]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:01.435 --> 02:00:02.896]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:00:18.477 --> 02:00:22.040]  The Alex Jones Show, I will be with you into the fourth hour as well.
[02:00:22.040 --> 02:00:40.133]  Coming up at the bottom of this hour we have Syrian Girl, a regular contributor to the show, to talk about the big subject, the fact that we've now got US destroyers, submarines, aircraft refueling planes all circulating, all heading, all steaming towards the region for this anticipated
[02:00:40.993 --> 02:00:43.215]  Tomahawk missile attack on Syria.
[02:00:43.215 --> 02:00:44.616]  Of course it happened last year.
[02:00:44.616 --> 02:00:48.098]  They had an investigation into that and it only emerged recently.
[02:00:48.098 --> 02:00:53.062]  But there was no evidence whatsoever as to who did the previous chemical weapons attack.
[02:00:53.062 --> 02:00:59.887]  Just as there's been no proper investigation into the attack that happened on Saturday night.
[02:00:59.887 --> 02:01:02.549]  So obviously Owen's talked about Mueller.
[02:01:02.549 --> 02:01:04.130]  He's talked about Michael Cohen.
[02:01:04.130 --> 02:01:06.432]  And we're going to focus on that a little bit later.
[02:01:06.432 --> 02:01:09.234]  But I'm going to head into Syria before the interview starts.
[02:01:10.137 --> 02:01:12.780]  For now, though, I'm going to get into this headline, which is out of Breitbart.
[02:01:12.780 --> 02:01:29.699]  We've talked about the state of free speech in the United Kingdom over the past several weeks, of course, the banning of YouTubers like Lauren Southern, Brittany Pettibone, Martin Selmer, and it only seems to be getting more absurd, more meme-like, more joke-like.
[02:01:29.699 --> 02:01:31.461]  This is a headline out of Breitbart.com.
[02:01:32.466 --> 02:01:40.835]  Problematic phrase, British values, Islamist, banned in the classroom by politically correctness obsessed SMP.
[02:01:40.835 --> 02:01:43.557]  Now the SMP is the Scottish National Party.
[02:01:43.557 --> 02:01:48.723]  That's basically the Communist Party in Sweden, in Scotland at this point.
[02:01:48.723 --> 02:01:49.944]  Sweden, Freudian slip.
[02:01:49.944 --> 02:01:52.767]  Scotland is the Sweden of the United Kingdom, let's put it that way.
[02:01:53.422 --> 02:02:05.108]  So now the Scottish National Party, which is the ruling party in Scotland, has been slammed over guidance which claims that supposedly offensive terminology like British values could inspire terror attacks.
[02:02:05.108 --> 02:02:06.229]  That's right.
[02:02:06.229 --> 02:02:16.854]  They're ordering teachers or warning them not to use the phrase British values in classrooms because it could offend Muslims, because it could inspire terror attacks.
[02:02:17.566 --> 02:02:22.990]  They're saying, don't say this, this could trigger actual terrorists who are in your classrooms.
[02:02:22.990 --> 02:02:26.072]  This is a state of free speech in Britain right now.
[02:02:26.072 --> 02:02:41.623]  Article continues, the concept of British values, this is a direct quote from this guide, the concept of British values can cause offence and complain to the hands of groups who seek to assert that there is an inherent conflict between being British and being Muslim.
[02:02:42.572 --> 02:02:50.499]  Scottish teachers have been told defending the move, a spokesman said using the wrong words in the classroom could amplify the rhetoric used by terrorists and violent extremists.
[02:02:50.499 --> 02:02:54.141]  So again, we're catering to the feelings of terrorists.
[02:02:54.141 --> 02:02:59.986]  They're basically saying this might hurt the feelings of potential terrorists, so you can't say it.
[02:02:59.986 --> 02:03:02.508]  You can't use the term British values.
[02:03:02.508 --> 02:03:07.933]  That's what should be being taught in classrooms in the United Kingdom.
[02:03:07.933 --> 02:03:09.073]  British values.
[02:03:09.073 --> 02:03:12.016]  That's the problem as to why we have no authentic
[02:03:12.645 --> 02:03:13.425]  Pride!
[02:03:13.425 --> 02:03:15.787]  No authentic civic pride in this country.
[02:03:15.787 --> 02:03:20.769]  No kind of firm belief in our own, you know, our own civilization at this point.
[02:03:20.769 --> 02:03:22.570]  Western civilization.
[02:03:22.570 --> 02:03:24.451]  It's been denigrated.
[02:03:24.451 --> 02:03:26.832]  It's been debunked at every possible opportunity.
[02:03:26.832 --> 02:03:33.075]  We're made to feel guilty about colonialism and all these other historical sins about slavery.
[02:03:33.075 --> 02:03:35.136]  Even though British people were the first to end slavery,
[02:03:35.979 --> 02:03:42.600]  Way beyond, or way before, any other country in the world, basically, and it still exists in numerous Middle Eastern and African countries today.
[02:03:42.600 --> 02:03:45.941]  No, we should be made to feel guilty about it.
[02:03:45.941 --> 02:03:47.641]  Like, that is a British value.
[02:03:47.641 --> 02:03:48.801]  We ended slavery.
[02:03:48.801 --> 02:03:49.922]  William Wilberforce.
[02:03:49.922 --> 02:03:51.822]  Why is that not being taught?
[02:03:51.822 --> 02:03:55.163]  Why is the very phrase, British values, not being used?
[02:03:55.163 --> 02:03:57.023]  They're threatening teachers.
[02:03:57.023 --> 02:04:01.364]  If they say British values, it could offend potential terrorists.
[02:04:01.364 --> 02:04:03.244]  Absolute joke country at this point.
[02:04:04.324 --> 02:04:10.786]  Meanwhile, you've got all these radical schools where they're teaching kids Islamist propaganda in Birmingham and all these other cities.
[02:04:10.786 --> 02:04:12.287]  Nothing happens to them, no.
[02:04:12.287 --> 02:04:17.769]  But you can't say British values in a British school teaching kids history.
[02:04:17.769 --> 02:04:20.650]  How topsy-turvy is that?
[02:04:20.650 --> 02:04:27.092]  UK Security Minister Ben Wallace accused Education Scotland of playing PC, politically correct politics, before children's safety.
[02:04:28.163 --> 02:04:34.887]  When the directive, which stresses the importance of using appropriate and accurate terms when discussing terror, came to light at the weekend.
[02:04:34.887 --> 02:04:42.571]  We're going to continue with this because they've cited other phrases that they can't use either for fear, for concern of offending Muslims.
[02:04:42.571 --> 02:04:43.111]  We'll be back.
[02:04:43.111 --> 02:04:44.372]  This is the Alex Jones Show live.
[02:04:44.372 --> 02:04:45.052]  Don't go away.
[02:04:45.052 --> 02:04:45.993]  InfoWars.com.
[02:04:56.488 --> 02:04:58.828]  InfoWars Life is launching its newest product.
[02:04:58.828 --> 02:05:00.989]  We're really, really proud of it.

[02:05:51.141 --> 02:05:53.663]  And I think it's going to be the same way with this fiber.

[02:06:03.115 --> 02:06:04.335]  You found it!
[02:06:04.335 --> 02:06:06.396]  The tip of the spear!
[02:06:06.396 --> 02:06:09.397]  It is the Alex Jones Show!
[02:06:09.397 --> 02:06:15.559]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson!
[02:06:15.559 --> 02:06:27.823]  So we're talking about this guide that's been given to teachers in Scotland, basically warning them they can't use certain phrases for fear of offending Muslims, and for fear of upsetting terrorists.
[02:06:28.402 --> 02:06:31.223]  Now you notice the little hidden Islamophobia.
[02:06:31.223 --> 02:06:34.245]  They lecture the right about Islamophobia all day.
[02:06:34.245 --> 02:06:38.347]  But in essence they're saying that this could offend Muslims and by proxy terrorists.
[02:06:38.347 --> 02:06:40.728]  So what, you're saying all Muslims are terrorists?
[02:06:40.728 --> 02:06:45.330]  That's the connection they're making, not me.
[02:06:45.330 --> 02:06:48.072]  So the Islamophobia is coming from their direction.
[02:06:48.072 --> 02:06:55.775]  They say using the term British values in a classroom in Great Britain should not be allowed.
[02:06:55.775 --> 02:06:56.876]  This could offend people.
[02:06:57.583 --> 02:07:00.307]  Now they put British values in a problematic column.
[02:07:00.307 --> 02:07:01.569]  That's one of their favourite words.
[02:07:01.569 --> 02:07:02.250]  Problematic.
[02:07:02.250 --> 02:07:03.852]  Everything's problematic.
[02:07:03.852 --> 02:07:09.660]  Juxtaposed with the safe term, shared values, which means absolutely nothing.
[02:07:09.660 --> 02:07:10.742]  What values?
[02:07:10.742 --> 02:07:12.084]  What values are we talking about here?
[02:07:12.765 --> 02:07:18.528]  Educators learned from the paper that the former term, British Values, could, quote, cause offence.
[02:07:18.528 --> 02:07:22.731]  And of course, we don't want anybody to be offended because what happens when people are offended?
[02:07:22.731 --> 02:07:25.292]  Oh, they become terrorists, according to this.
[02:07:25.292 --> 02:07:31.235]  Oh, so you're saying that Muslims who are offended are guaranteed to become terrorists?
[02:07:31.235 --> 02:07:33.937]  Sounds pretty Islamophobic to me, that.
[02:07:33.937 --> 02:07:35.878]  Sounds pretty bigoted to me.
[02:07:37.825 --> 02:07:50.695]  Teachers should refer to shared values rather than British because pupils must be molded into quote, I mean this is straight up Orwellian, responsible citizens who respect other people different beliefs and cultures.
[02:07:50.695 --> 02:07:55.759]  So we have to cater to their cultures but we can't say British values.
[02:07:55.759 --> 02:07:58.901]  We can't reassert have confidence in our own culture.
[02:07:58.901 --> 02:08:02.064]  This is complete la-la land.
[02:08:02.064 --> 02:08:05.867]  The document called to mind the SNP regime's enthusiasm for
[02:08:06.795 --> 02:08:18.363]  PISA's announcement that international education rankings would begin testing for how well schools are nurturing globalist attitudes, literally indoctrination centres for globalism.
[02:08:18.363 --> 02:08:29.009]  Education spokesman for the Scottish Conservatives warned that parents would be astonished and very angry at the edicts asserting that British values are part of our history and are important to this country's culture.
[02:08:29.009 --> 02:08:30.631]  No they're not, they're offensive to Muslims.
[02:08:30.631 --> 02:08:31.271]  You can't say them.
[02:08:32.825 --> 02:08:33.846]  According to the SNP.
[02:08:33.846 --> 02:08:40.411]  According to the official SNP advice, it's dangerous for educators to refer to the word Islamist.
[02:08:40.411 --> 02:08:41.632]  This is another banned word.
[02:08:41.632 --> 02:08:42.712]  You can't say Islamist.
[02:08:42.712 --> 02:08:43.933]  You can't say Islam.
[02:08:43.933 --> 02:08:45.495]  No, you can't say Islamist.
[02:08:45.495 --> 02:08:46.295]  What can you say?
[02:08:46.295 --> 02:08:48.457]  How do we describe these people?
[02:08:48.457 --> 02:08:53.000]  Which is frequently used to refer to fundamentalist adherence to Islam.
[02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:59.365]  Okay, so the very word that the politically correct types told us to use years ago to separate
[02:09:00.934 --> 02:09:09.621]  Nominal Muslims who are just Muslim believers from political Muslims who are Islamists and in some ways use Islam as a political doctrine aggressively.
[02:09:09.621 --> 02:09:11.462]  That's not even the violent definition of it.
[02:09:11.462 --> 02:09:13.324]  We're not calling them jihadists.
[02:09:13.324 --> 02:09:15.766]  So we were told to say Islamists and not Islam.
[02:09:15.766 --> 02:09:17.847]  Now we can't say Islamists.
[02:09:17.847 --> 02:09:19.989]  That's politically incorrect too.
[02:09:19.989 --> 02:09:21.730]  Now it's a common theme here.
[02:09:21.730 --> 02:09:23.151]  Restriction of language.
[02:09:23.151 --> 02:09:24.372]  Restriction of thought.
[02:09:24.372 --> 02:09:26.854]  Restriction of freedom of speech.
[02:09:26.854 --> 02:09:28.856]  The slippery slope is plain to see.
[02:09:29.801 --> 02:09:42.249]  So you can't say British values, you can't say Islamists, because they claim it risks non-expert audiences linking the phenomena to ordinary Muslims in some way.
[02:09:42.249 --> 02:09:52.436]  Now, the very definition of the term Islamist or the way it's used is to differentiate normal, nominal Muslims who aren't politically driven from Islamists who are.
[02:09:52.436 --> 02:09:56.359]  That's why it was invented, that's why it was forced upon people in the first place.
[02:09:56.359 --> 02:09:58.080]  No, can't use that, that's gone.
[02:10:00.140 --> 02:10:02.682]  All audiences will make a connection to the Muslim faith.
[02:10:02.682 --> 02:10:05.485]  The phrase, faith, the phrase is best avoided.
[02:10:05.485 --> 02:10:09.028]  The literature warned recommending that teachers instead incorporate the term.
[02:10:09.028 --> 02:10:09.949]  And wait for this.
[02:10:09.949 --> 02:10:14.593]  Al-Qaeda inspired violent extremists.
[02:10:14.593 --> 02:10:17.136]  Into their vocabulary of safe language.
[02:10:17.136 --> 02:10:19.818]  What if, what if potential Al-Qaeda members are offended?
[02:10:19.818 --> 02:10:23.181]  Has nobody accounted for their feelings?
[02:10:23.181 --> 02:10:24.542]  And extremists?
[02:10:24.542 --> 02:10:26.284]  Surely that would offend extremists.
[02:10:27.978 --> 02:10:30.479]  That's their safe language.
[02:10:30.479 --> 02:10:38.083]  Literally they're just destroying words that are crucial to differentiating between certain arguments when it comes to Islam, like the word Islamist.
[02:10:38.083 --> 02:10:39.123]  You can't use that anymore.
[02:10:39.123 --> 02:10:43.485]  Now you have to say Al-Qaeda inspired violent extremists.
[02:10:43.485 --> 02:10:46.967]  Even though Al-Qaeda basically doesn't exist anymore, so it doesn't even make sense.
[02:10:48.712 --> 02:11:00.154]  Minister Wallace, a former member of Scottish Parliament who worked on Britain's supposed anti-extremism prevent programme, told the Telegraph it's shameful that people should put PC politics before children's safety.
[02:11:00.154 --> 02:11:02.755]  And it goes on and on and on.
[02:11:02.755 --> 02:11:07.376]  Literally they're telling teachers they can't say British values in British classrooms.
[02:11:07.376 --> 02:11:09.396]  What is wrong with this picture?
[02:11:09.396 --> 02:11:12.296]  Now this other article's just popped up on Twitter.
[02:11:12.296 --> 02:11:14.757]  This is out of the Daily Mail.
[02:11:15.640 --> 02:11:28.324]  Again in the UK, surprise surprise, fire chief apologises for repeatedly using gender-specific words man and he when describing firefighter staffing levels at a public council meeting.
[02:11:28.324 --> 02:11:32.146]  A chief fire officer has apologised, and rightly so!
[02:11:32.146 --> 02:11:32.766]  The bigot!
[02:11:33.737 --> 02:11:39.558]  ...for using the gender-specific words man and he at a meeting when describing fire crew staffing levels.
[02:11:39.558 --> 02:11:46.200]  Now this is in Rotherham, and you know what happened in Rotherham, don't you, over a period of, what, ten plus years?
[02:11:46.200 --> 02:11:59.142]  The industrial grooming of young women and children by Muslim rape gangs, which was ignored by the councils, by the police in that area, because they were afraid of being called racist.
[02:11:59.142 --> 02:12:01.463]  They were afraid of being called politically correct.
[02:12:01.463 --> 02:12:03.403]  It was so bad that in some cases,
[02:12:04.446 --> 02:12:08.387]  The fathers of these kids would find out where their kids were being abused.
[02:12:08.387 --> 02:12:10.128]  They would go to the house where they were being abused.
[02:12:10.128 --> 02:12:11.008]  They would call the police.
[02:12:11.008 --> 02:12:14.029]  The police would turn up and arrest the fathers, okay?
[02:12:14.029 --> 02:12:20.550]  This is Rotherham, where you can't say he and man because, again, it might offend somebody.
[02:12:20.550 --> 02:12:27.052]  So this Jamie Courtney, South Yorkshire Fire Chief, was brought to task for using the outdated language
[02:12:29.494 --> 02:12:36.637]  He and Man is now outdated language at a Rotherham Council meeting after a complaint was received from a member of the public.
[02:12:36.637 --> 02:12:56.084]  The person who made the complaint, again, one complaint, one complaint, who did not wish to be identified said, I felt his language was minimising the role of women in the fire service, especially as International Women's Day had just taken place and South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue had made a video highlighting the role women play in the service.
[02:12:56.084 --> 02:12:58.665]  Now this is South Yorkshire, this is where I'm from.
[02:13:00.299 --> 02:13:03.221]  Normally the people up there have a little bit more common sense.
[02:13:03.221 --> 02:13:06.663]  They're not living in a Metropolitan Elitist bubble like London.
[02:13:06.663 --> 02:13:12.026]  They're not so obsessed with thought policing, with speech policing, with political correctness.
[02:13:12.026 --> 02:13:13.167]  But no, this is Rotherham.
[02:13:13.167 --> 02:13:21.672]  This is the same place where we had a giant grooming scandal that was ignored and in some instances covered up by these same councils.
[02:13:23.234 --> 02:13:31.937]  So they had one person complain about this guy using the word he and man and he had to apologize and rightly so, the thought criminal.
[02:13:31.937 --> 02:13:44.301]  It goes on, responding to the complaint, Diana Terrace, clerk to South Yorkshire's Fire Authority, wrote back saying she had raised the Chief's use of gender-specific language with him and discussed the matter with both the Chair and Vice-Chair.
[02:13:44.301 --> 02:13:46.662]  How about just putting out fires, okay?
[02:13:46.662 --> 02:13:49.403]  Just put out damn fires.
[02:13:49.403 --> 02:13:52.604]  Why are you policing language when a guy uses the words he
[02:13:53.971 --> 02:13:58.112]  And man, what the hell is going on here?
[02:13:58.112 --> 02:14:01.134]  He's a great advocate of equality and diversity.
[02:14:01.134 --> 02:14:02.774]  They had to do the full apology.
[02:14:02.774 --> 02:14:05.795]  It wasn't enough for him to just apologise.
[02:14:05.795 --> 02:14:13.538]  And his colleagues had to come out and back him up and say, no, he's an advocate of equality and diversity.
[02:14:13.538 --> 02:14:15.238]  He doesn't hate women, honestly.
[02:14:15.238 --> 02:14:16.659]  He just said the word man.
[02:14:16.659 --> 02:14:18.179]  Please forgive him.
[02:14:18.179 --> 02:14:20.160]  Mr Courtney declined to comment.
[02:14:20.160 --> 02:14:22.661]  Instead of South Yorkshire Fire Service spokeswoman,
[02:14:23.746 --> 02:14:50.960]  said the chief has already responded by the clerk to the authority and has apologized unreservedly and has done so at the time and did so at the time it had been pointed out to him so they got one complaint he apologized no that's not enough the people are asking for further groveling there needs to be more groveling he needs to resign just just just fire everyone in this fire brigade forget about the fires he used the word man
[02:14:52.310 --> 02:15:04.217]  God forbid, this is the situation in the United Kingdom right now, where people are getting publicly shamed and put on the threat of losing their job for using the word man.
[02:15:04.217 --> 02:15:07.738]  Oh, political correctness is just being nice to people.
[02:15:07.738 --> 02:15:11.721]  Mass Muslim rape gangs that don't get intercepted, they arrest the fathers.
[02:15:11.721 --> 02:15:13.862]  In some cases they arrest the victims.
[02:15:13.862 --> 02:15:15.303]  This is the state of free speech.
[02:15:15.303 --> 02:15:17.604]  This is the state of PC in the UK.
[02:15:18.433 --> 02:15:20.996]  I mean, I'm not going to be able to live in this country for that much longer.
[02:15:20.996 --> 02:15:28.524]  If this is the way it's going, if it gets worse, I'm not going to be able to do what I do and remain living in this country.
[02:15:28.524 --> 02:15:31.147]  People are arrested for tweets.
[02:15:31.147 --> 02:15:35.651]  3,000 people arrested for tweets every single year because of stuff like this.
[02:15:35.651 --> 02:15:36.532]  It's Orwellian.
[02:15:36.532 --> 02:15:38.014]  It has to stop now.
[02:15:39.238 --> 02:15:41.241]  We'll be back in the next segment of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:15:41.241 --> 02:15:43.083]  We're going to get into the latest Syria news.
[02:15:43.083 --> 02:15:48.689]  World War III potentially on the way and Republicans are signing up for it with a smile on their faces.
[02:15:48.689 --> 02:15:49.811]  We'll be back, don't go away.
[02:15:55.305 --> 02:15:57.948]  Attention business owners and independent contractors.

[02:18:26.560 --> 02:18:36.768]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[02:18:36.768 --> 02:18:38.830]  And this part is most important.
[02:18:38.830 --> 02:18:45.295]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[02:18:45.615 --> 02:18:54.320]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[02:19:06.687 --> 02:19:08.748]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield.
[02:19:08.748 --> 02:19:11.609]  Toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[02:19:11.609 --> 02:19:13.090]  It's made in the USA.
[02:19:13.090 --> 02:19:19.933]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[02:19:19.933 --> 02:19:21.154]  It is a classical 360 wind.
[02:19:22.014 --> 02:19:31.716]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[02:19:31.716 --> 02:19:48.539]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[02:19:48.539 --> 02:19:51.680]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[02:19:51.840 --> 02:19:58.844]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Field at InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:19:58.844 --> 02:20:07.369]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:07.369 --> 02:20:09.730]  News, analysis, reports.
[02:20:09.730 --> 02:20:11.591]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:11.591 --> 02:20:14.893]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:20:23.447 --> 02:20:44.238]  We're going to go to my video that I put out on Sunday night shortly, the truth about the chemical weapons attack in Syria because we've got Partisan Girl, Syrian Girl coming up in the next segment to get into this, to get into the background of what actually happened and why it made absolutely no sense whatsoever for the Syrian government to be behind this attack.
[02:20:44.238 --> 02:20:46.179]  Isn't it a stunning coincidence
[02:20:46.699 --> 02:20:57.647]  That whenever the Syrian army is on the verge of major victory in different areas of the country, a chemical weapons attack happens that brings down on them global condemnation and US airstrikes.
[02:20:57.647 --> 02:21:00.349]  Quite the coincidence there, isn't it?
[02:21:00.349 --> 02:21:07.094]  No motivation whatsoever for Syria or Russia to be behind this attack, and yet it happens again.
[02:21:07.094 --> 02:21:09.996]  Same thing that happened last year.
[02:21:09.996 --> 02:21:13.318]  Trump announces he's going to pull out of Syria.
[02:21:13.318 --> 02:21:16.080]  Regime change agenda off the table completely.
[02:21:16.738 --> 02:21:18.039]  Same thing this time round.
[02:21:18.039 --> 02:21:20.781]  Trump pronounces pull troops out of Syria.
[02:21:20.781 --> 02:21:22.342]  Deep State says no.
[02:21:22.342 --> 02:21:23.523]  Oh, and then what happens?
[02:21:23.523 --> 02:21:25.784]  A convenient chemical weapons attack.
[02:21:25.784 --> 02:21:28.106]  Am I shocked?
[02:21:28.106 --> 02:21:29.627]  Now, no one's saying that kids didn't die.
[02:21:29.627 --> 02:21:30.267]  This is horrific.
[02:21:30.267 --> 02:21:31.848]  People die.
[02:21:31.848 --> 02:21:37.352]  But I get questions from people who say, well, if Assad didn't do it, who did?
[02:21:37.352 --> 02:21:43.256]  Oh, maybe ISIS terrorists who use chemical weapons in Syria 52 times plus.
[02:21:43.256 --> 02:21:44.997]  And those numbers are just up until the end of 2016.
[02:21:46.937 --> 02:21:52.480]  Maybe the same jihadist rebels that have been caught faking chemical weapons attacks on numerous different occasions.
[02:21:52.480 --> 02:21:58.764]  In fact, the UN did an investigation in one case and that's how they concluded their investigation.
[02:21:58.764 --> 02:22:05.728]  We're going to get into that with Siri and go, I want to tell you about the great products at Infowarsstore.com because this is how we fund this network.
[02:22:05.728 --> 02:22:13.133]  This is why the mainstream media hates us because we can't be targeted with boycott campaigns because our supporters, our audience, are our fuel.
[02:22:14.432 --> 02:22:16.896]  You getting the products keeps us on the air, helps us expand.

[02:22:55.663 --> 02:22:59.444]  We have Alpha Power back in stock.
[02:22:59.444 --> 02:23:00.805]  25% off.

[02:23:11.360 --> 02:23:18.846]  As you age, your body can lose testosterone at rates of about 1-2% each year, or 20% each year if you work for BuzzFeed.
[02:23:18.846 --> 02:23:23.670]  That's why we worked hard to make an affordable solution to the greatest problem of age.
[02:23:23.670 --> 02:23:28.614]  Incredible ingredients in this formula will help you beat the test of time and assist in restoring that reduced energy.
[02:23:29.292 --> 02:23:33.815]  And changing mood often comes with time and age, which happens to us all.

[02:23:45.684 --> 02:23:52.909]  We don't even brag about some of the mood enhancing benefits, which are proven in double-blind independent studies, peer-reviewed studies.
[02:23:52.909 --> 02:23:57.592]  It is BODYS, InfoWarsLife, InfoWarsStore.com, 25% off.

[02:23:58.132 --> 02:23:58.893]  Support this network.
[02:23:59.918 --> 02:24:03.502]  Now we're gonna go to the truth about the chemical weapons attack in Syria.
[02:24:03.502 --> 02:24:05.724]  This is a video that came out a couple of days ago.
[02:24:05.724 --> 02:24:08.086]  Gonna set it up for the interview with Syrian Girl.
[02:24:08.086 --> 02:24:09.288]  Here is that video.
[02:24:11.277 --> 02:24:11.858]  Pull U.S.
[02:24:11.858 --> 02:24:13.019]  troops out of Syria.
[02:24:13.019 --> 02:24:15.282]  The Pentagon tells him it's not going to happen.
[02:24:15.282 --> 02:24:26.935]  And then with the Syrian army and Russia on the verge of defeating ISIS and jihadist rebels in the town of Douma, they launch a massive chemical weapons attack that brings global condemnation, inviting massive U.S.
[02:24:26.935 --> 02:24:28.557]  airstrikes across the country.
[02:24:28.557 --> 02:24:32.121]  And we're just supposed to swallow this entire narrative without question.
[02:24:32.361 --> 02:24:32.781]  No!
[02:24:32.781 --> 02:24:33.922]  That's insane!
[02:24:33.922 --> 02:24:34.863]  Now let's get this clear.
[02:24:34.863 --> 02:24:38.125]  No one is denying that this attack happened and that people were killed.
[02:24:38.125 --> 02:24:39.006]  This is horrible.
[02:24:39.006 --> 02:24:43.289]  But why is Trump ignoring his own warning from 2013?
[02:24:43.289 --> 02:24:46.531]  Again, to our very foolish leader, do not attack Syria.
[02:24:46.531 --> 02:24:49.593]  If you do, many very bad things will happen.
[02:24:49.593 --> 02:24:52.495]  And from that fight, the US gets nothing.
[02:24:52.495 --> 02:24:54.377]  What changed between then and now?
[02:24:55.177 --> 02:24:56.498]  Absolutely nothing.
[02:24:56.498 --> 02:25:00.799]  Apart from the fact that now ISIS was on the cusp of being eliminated.
[02:25:00.799 --> 02:25:06.782]  Which is why it makes absolutely no sense for the Russians or the Syrian government to be behind this attack.
[02:25:06.782 --> 02:25:11.584]  The jihadist rebel group had agreed to leave the area within 48 hours.
[02:25:11.584 --> 02:25:14.265]  They'd lost the battle.
[02:25:14.265 --> 02:25:17.046]  90% of eastern Ghouta was already liberated.
[02:25:17.046 --> 02:25:21.348]  Why on earth would the Syrian army sabotage their own victory?
[02:25:21.408 --> 02:25:28.013]  And why does almost every chemical weapon attack happen when the Syrian army is about to close in on a rebel stronghold?
[02:25:28.013 --> 02:25:29.355]  And what's the evidence here?
[02:25:29.355 --> 02:25:38.242]  Unverified footage from the White Helmets, a group with direct links to the very jihadist groups that benefit from this chemical weapons attack.
[02:25:38.422 --> 02:25:41.925]  Are we really going to go to war again in the Middle East on the basis of that?
[02:25:41.925 --> 02:25:46.508]  With no investigation whatsoever on the basis of Ivanka's tears?
[02:25:46.508 --> 02:25:52.272]  Up until 2016 alone, ISIS had used chemical weapons at least 52 times.
[02:25:52.272 --> 02:25:58.997]  A rebel-held chemical weapons factory was discovered in the same region where this happened just a few weeks ago.
[02:25:58.997 --> 02:26:04.121]  They found materials and plans for some of the very same chemical weapons used in this attack.
[02:26:04.341 --> 02:26:10.363]  Russia warned last month that militants were preparing to falsify a government chemical attack against civilians.
[02:26:10.363 --> 02:26:18.987]  How do we know this wasn't a false flag, given that Islamist rebels have been responsible for staging chemical weapons attacks on numerous previous occasions?
[02:26:18.987 --> 02:26:27.710]  It took nearly a year for Secretary of Defense James Mattis to admit there was no evidence the Syrian government was behind last year's chemical weapons attack.
[02:26:27.830 --> 02:26:31.774]  The attack that prompted Trump to order airstrikes against the Shayrat Air Base.
[02:26:31.774 --> 02:26:36.079]  So why the rush to war with no real investigation of what happened?
[02:26:36.079 --> 02:26:41.265]  If President Obama had crossed his state at red line in the sand, the Syrian disaster would have ended long ago.
[02:26:41.265 --> 02:26:43.167]  Animal Assad would have been history!
[02:26:43.167 --> 02:26:46.030]  Yeah, and ISIS would be running the damn country!
[02:26:46.030 --> 02:26:49.174]  How is an attack on Syria going to resonate with Trump's base?
[02:26:49.634 --> 02:26:52.077]  Not very well if this polls anything to go by.
[02:26:52.077 --> 02:26:57.102]  After more than 20,000 votes, 66% oppose intervention in Syria.
[02:26:57.102 --> 02:26:59.245]  Forget Make America Great Again.
[02:26:59.245 --> 02:27:02.709]  This is Make America ISIS's air force again.
[02:27:02.709 --> 02:27:04.290]  And it's completely deranged.
[02:27:04.290 --> 02:27:07.254]  This is the opposite of what Trump supporters voted for.
[02:27:07.674 --> 02:27:09.175]  She wants to fight for rebels.
[02:27:09.175 --> 02:27:10.336]  There's only one problem.
[02:27:10.336 --> 02:27:11.957]  You don't even know who the rebels are.
[02:27:11.957 --> 02:27:16.520]  I don't like Assad at all, but Assad is killing ISIS.
[02:27:16.520 --> 02:27:18.501]  Russia is killing ISIS.
[02:27:18.501 --> 02:27:24.165]  This is the same lunatic foreign policy that Hillary Clinton would have followed if she'd have won the election.
[02:27:24.165 --> 02:27:27.827]  The base gets that, but most Republicans don't.
[02:27:27.827 --> 02:27:32.530]  After last year's airstrike, which again was based on flimsy or no evidence whatsoever,
[02:27:34.331 --> 02:27:38.593]  84% of Republicans approved of it and Trump's approval ratings went higher.
[02:27:38.593 --> 02:27:45.257]  Is Trump deliberately embroiling the US in another war as a stunt to help the Republicans in the midterms?
[02:27:45.257 --> 02:27:51.221]  Just this week a CNBC piece mentioned a conveniently timed war to do just that.
[02:27:51.221 --> 02:27:52.301]  Is it worth it?
[02:27:52.301 --> 02:27:54.123]  Is it really worth it?
[02:27:54.123 --> 02:27:56.564]  We can only hope that cooler heads prevail.
[02:27:56.664 --> 02:28:04.408]  Because a full-scale attack on Syria would only embolden and empower the very jihadist rebels Trump vowed to eliminate.
[02:28:04.408 --> 02:28:08.450]  It would be disastrous for the Middle East and for the thousands more U.S.
[02:28:08.450 --> 02:28:12.052]  troops fed into that interminable meat grinder.
[02:28:12.052 --> 02:28:15.074]  Mr. President, this is absurd.
[02:28:15.074 --> 02:28:16.715]  This is suicidal.
[02:28:16.715 --> 02:28:18.316]  This is reckless.
[02:28:18.316 --> 02:28:20.317]  This is not America first.
[02:28:20.317 --> 02:28:22.498]  This is the deep state winning.
[02:28:26.121 --> 02:28:29.044]  That is the truth about the chemical weapons attack in Syria.
[02:28:29.044 --> 02:28:31.405]  We have Syrian Girl coming up next.
[02:28:31.405 --> 02:28:38.832]  As US destroyers, submarines and aircrafts steam towards the region, this is going to be a bigger conflagration.
[02:28:38.832 --> 02:28:43.495]  If we don't stop it from happening right now, we'll be back after the break with Syrian Girl.
[02:28:43.495 --> 02:28:45.697]  Breaking news at InfoWars.com.
[02:28:45.697 --> 02:28:46.298]  Don't go away.
[02:28:55.711 --> 02:28:56.531]  This is Dan Pilla.
[02:28:56.531 --> 02:28:58.332]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?

[02:29:36.870 --> 02:29:42.571]  We're in a constitutional crisis and our government is now being run and ruled by a shadow government.
[02:29:42.571 --> 02:29:45.992]  We gotta get this out because just because you're a white folks doesn't mean other people are.

[02:31:01.864 --> 02:31:02.745]  It'd take hours.
[02:31:02.745 --> 02:31:05.185]  Michael's VX Plus now has a lower price.
[02:31:05.185 --> 02:31:06.346]  It's stronger.
[02:31:06.346 --> 02:31:07.966]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[02:31:07.966 --> 02:31:11.187]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[02:31:11.187 --> 02:31:12.307]  It's back in stock.
[02:31:12.307 --> 02:31:15.488]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.
[02:31:15.488 --> 02:31:18.809]  It's got the preglanone that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[02:31:19.309 --> 02:31:19.469]  It's
[02:31:38.012 --> 02:31:39.994]  High quality silver and a lot more.
[02:31:39.994 --> 02:31:41.376]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[02:31:41.376 --> 02:31:51.306]  So thank you all for remembering InfoWareStore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake, and it's so essential to spread the word.
[02:31:51.306 --> 02:31:54.350]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[02:31:55.807 --> 02:31:58.608]  It's been sold out for months and now it's back.
[02:31:58.608 --> 02:32:09.071]  It's Mico ZX plus lower price, more ingredients because we scaled up, signed a year contract with even bigger organic manufacturer and producer.
[02:32:09.071 --> 02:32:09.871]  Scalability.

[02:32:18.013 --> 02:32:20.595]  It's the other side of the equation.
[02:32:20.595 --> 02:32:30.383]  Everybody thinks about probiotics and how great they are for your gut because you have toxins in the environment, pesticides, herbicides, but more importantly than bad bacteria, the probiotics help this place.
[02:32:30.383 --> 02:32:39.250]  Yeast mold creates slime walls and once the candida and the yeast and the mold and all that get in there, it causes all sorts of serious issues.
[02:32:39.250 --> 02:32:45.215]  Well, this has got a bunch of concentrated herbs in it and compounds known to destroy that slime wall.
[02:32:45.675 --> 02:32:48.498]  Don't wait to start detoxifying your body until it's too late.

[02:33:09.270 --> 02:33:16.315]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:16.315 --> 02:33:20.658]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:33:20.658 --> 02:33:33.728]  We are live on the Alex Jones Show on the verge of what looks like another disastrous military intervention into the Middle East, not just on behalf of America, but other Western nations too.
[02:33:34.551 --> 02:33:52.123]  Steve Herman, Chief White House Bureau Chief with VOA, tweets further indications just now from French President Emmanuel Macron that the Saudi Crown Prince that a multinational military action is being planned to respond to the latest reported chemical weapons attack against civilians in Syria.
[02:33:53.055 --> 02:33:59.976]  Also, Macron said if strikes are launched in Syria they will target the chemical weapons capabilities of the Assad regime.
[02:33:59.976 --> 02:34:02.997]  Wait a sec, I thought they gave up the chemical weapons.
[02:34:02.997 --> 02:34:07.557]  I thought that's why we didn't do this back in 2013.
[02:34:07.557 --> 02:34:13.378]  We also have destroyers steaming their way towards Syria right now.
[02:34:13.378 --> 02:34:19.279]  The US Navy destroyer USS Donald Cook is already in the region as of yesterday.
[02:34:19.279 --> 02:34:22.260]  It's equipped with 60 Tomahawk cruise missiles
[02:34:23.328 --> 02:34:29.371]  We also have this headline, US missile destroyer reportedly sailing towards Syria as Trump weighs options.
[02:34:29.371 --> 02:34:35.974]  And we have a seven warship strike group with cruise missiles on its way to the Mediterranean.
[02:34:35.974 --> 02:34:38.295]  That is the Harry S Truman carrier strike group.
[02:34:38.295 --> 02:34:45.898]  But they're saying that's not going to reach Syria until April 22nd, which is in 12 days time.
[02:34:45.898 --> 02:34:52.641]  So it's pretty bizarre how if this is supposed to be a quick rapid response strike, they're allowing Syria to prepare for it.
[02:34:53.254 --> 02:34:53.454]  I think?
[02:35:11.989 --> 02:35:17.630]  Not very many people died, not very much damage was done, it was a symbolic act, it was pretty pointless.
[02:35:17.630 --> 02:35:26.752]  This looks like it could be something way bigger, and that they may take a little more time to arrange it, at least in terms of an international alliance.
[02:35:26.752 --> 02:35:34.913]  Now to talk about all this, we're joined by Syrian girl Marama Susli, who is of course is a regular contributor for InfoWars.com.
[02:35:34.913 --> 02:35:37.494]  She is a geopolitical analyst for New Eastern Outlook.
[02:35:38.553 --> 02:35:41.654]  She put out a video a couple of days ago called, What Really Happened?
[02:35:41.654 --> 02:35:45.054]  Chemical Attack That Led to Missile Strikes on Syria.
[02:35:45.054 --> 02:35:46.995]  And she's here to talk about it now.
[02:35:46.995 --> 02:35:49.395]  Maram, welcome back.
[02:35:49.395 --> 02:35:51.676]  Thanks for having me.
[02:35:51.676 --> 02:36:04.578]  Now, let's get into the background of this because, you know, unlike the Trump administration, it seems, unlike President Macron, unlike Saudi Arabia, we're not just going to have a flippant, reckless reaction not knowing any of the evidence.
[02:36:04.578 --> 02:36:08.079]  Let's actually look at what could have possibly happened in this town
[02:36:08.780 --> 02:36:11.824]  Both before and after when this chemical attack happened.
[02:36:11.824 --> 02:36:17.231]  What was the situation in the town of Douma before this alleged attack happened?
[02:36:17.231 --> 02:36:24.340]  Was there any, any kind of battlefield or strategic motive for the Syrian army to launch this attack?
[02:36:24.340 --> 02:36:26.683]  What was the situation on the ground before it happened?
[02:36:28.275 --> 02:36:31.237]  No, there wasn't, and it's exactly as you said.
[02:36:31.237 --> 02:36:36.440]  You know, Douma is a suburb that's part of a bigger suburb called Ghouta.
[02:36:36.440 --> 02:36:47.728]  Now, the insurgents that controlled Ghouta, which were Al-Qaeda linked by the way, and the US, even the United Nations, agreed that Al-Qaeda was controlling this city.
[02:36:47.728 --> 02:36:52.951]  The majority of them actually surrendered and had already given up their weapons or taken a bus ride.
[02:36:53.471 --> 02:36:55.332]  to another town called Idlib.
[02:36:55.332 --> 02:37:02.315]  So the only group that hadn't surrendered was this group called the Islamic Army or Jaysh al-Islam.
[02:37:02.315 --> 02:37:09.279]  And the reason they didn't surrender and they controlled Douma is because they had leverage in the form of hostages.
[02:37:09.279 --> 02:37:15.082]  Civilian hostages that they had kidnapped from nearby pro-Assad towns.
[02:37:15.082 --> 02:37:19.484]  And these are the wives and children of basically Syrian soldiers.
[02:37:20.405 --> 02:37:31.453]  And these civilians, they took them and they put them in cages in about 2015 and they paraded them around Douma and said that, you know... These are the moderates!
[02:37:31.453 --> 02:37:34.375]  These are the moderates that put people in cages and parade them around.
[02:37:34.375 --> 02:37:36.617]  In fact, I've seen the video clips of that.
[02:37:37.228 --> 02:37:39.210]  Parading them around in cages.
[02:37:39.210 --> 02:37:45.916]  They had another video which you play which there was one of the victims, they made them walk through like underground tunnels and they look very distressed.
[02:37:45.916 --> 02:37:48.879]  We're playing some of that footage now of them in the cages.
[02:37:48.879 --> 02:37:50.821]  So this group, this army of Islam,
[02:37:51.508 --> 02:37:54.630]  That they were the remaining factions who refused to surrender.
[02:37:54.630 --> 02:38:05.618]  Because as far as I understand it, the other rebels had agreed, right, with the Syrians that they would leave within 48 hours for these other rebel-controlled areas and they would get out of Douma.
[02:38:05.618 --> 02:38:08.721]  But you're saying they had these hostages.
[02:38:08.721 --> 02:38:11.703]  Were those hostages amongst the victims in this attack, do you think?
[02:38:12.930 --> 02:38:13.811]  I think so.
[02:38:13.811 --> 02:38:21.315]  I mean, part of the negotiations, which did go through in the end, was that they have to release the hostages.
[02:38:21.315 --> 02:38:29.000]  And the number of hostages was 4,000, except only 200 of the hostages actually came out alive.
[02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:30.601]  So what happened to the other 3,800?
[02:38:30.601 --> 02:38:38.726]  You know, the thing is that the reason they put them in cages was because they were using them as human shields.
[02:38:38.726 --> 02:38:41.668]  You're playing the video now of the civilians in the tunnels.
[02:38:42.208 --> 02:38:53.792]  They actually released that video two weeks ago as a sort of evidence to the government that they still have the hostages, the hostages are still alive, so that they could get the negotiations going.
[02:38:53.792 --> 02:38:59.654]  This group, Army of Islam, is actually supported and funded by Saudi Arabia.
[02:38:59.654 --> 02:39:05.596]  And it's interesting because if you see the timing of this chemical attack,
[02:39:06.737 --> 02:39:10.079]  First of all, Trump said he wants troops out of Syria.
[02:39:10.079 --> 02:39:19.466]  Now, why would Assad use chemical weapons if it looked like the US was finally about to just leave and, you know, let him take back the entire country?
[02:39:19.466 --> 02:39:28.292]  It's exactly the same scenario that played out last year when the US State Department, almost a year to the day of this attack, the US State Department said that
[02:39:29.505 --> 02:39:37.631]  The interesting thing about Trump's statement is that after he said he wants to pull troops out of Syria, a few days later he said that if Saudi Arabia wants U.S.
[02:39:37.631 --> 02:39:39.913]  troops to stay in Syria, they're going to have to pay for it.
[02:39:54.082 --> 02:40:01.923]  And of course, Saudi Arabia pays money to this Islamic Army group that's controlling Douma.
[02:40:01.923 --> 02:40:06.104]  And these are the people that conducted the false flag chemical attack.
[02:40:06.104 --> 02:40:10.785]  So basically, this was Saudi Arabia's way of, you know, keeping the U.S.
[02:40:10.785 --> 02:40:17.466]  in Syria because basically, they had negotiations with the U.S.
[02:40:17.466 --> 02:40:22.647]  and the Kurds in the northeast of the country, and they were basically given, like,
[02:40:23.551 --> 02:40:27.354]  And what does the U.S.
[02:40:27.354 --> 02:40:31.737]  get out of this?
[02:40:31.737 --> 02:40:44.867]  You know, it's not really Saudi Arabia that's running the show, and it's not Saudi money either, because even though the northeast of Syria is full of oil, and the majority of Syrian oil is there,
[02:40:45.487 --> 02:40:45.967]  The U.S.
[02:40:45.967 --> 02:40:49.028]  doesn't really need any more oil.
[02:40:49.028 --> 02:40:52.889]  The amount of oil that Syria has is nothing compared to the amount of oil that the U.S.
[02:40:52.889 --> 02:40:53.609]  has.
[02:40:53.609 --> 02:40:57.250]  The point is that they don't want Syrians to have that oil.
[02:40:57.250 --> 02:41:00.911]  They don't want Syria to be able to rebuild and become strong again.
[02:41:00.911 --> 02:41:02.512]  And why is that?
[02:41:02.512 --> 02:41:11.054]  Well, you know, Tucker Carlson asked that question on his show to Senator Roger Wicker, and he said it was because it was in the interest of Israel.
[02:41:14.167 --> 02:41:18.873]  So you're saying that it's basically a conspiracy between Saudi Arabia and Israel.
[02:41:18.873 --> 02:41:23.879]  We've now got Saudi Arabia announcing they're going to join the strikes with France.
[02:41:23.879 --> 02:41:27.363]  Now, I want to flash back to this, and we'll get more into this after the break.
[02:41:27.363 --> 02:41:30.767]  There's a headline up on Newsweek, that famous right-wing publication.
[02:41:31.497 --> 02:41:35.838]  Now Mattis admits there was no evidence Assad used poison gas on his people.
[02:41:35.838 --> 02:41:37.219]  That's literally the headline.
[02:41:37.219 --> 02:41:38.879]  This came out in February.
[02:41:38.879 --> 02:41:41.100]  Nobody really paid much attention to it.
[02:41:41.100 --> 02:41:50.582]  This is about the strike that happened last year, which was of course, we were told, beyond any shadow of a doubt, it was Assad that carried out the strike in April last year.
[02:41:50.582 --> 02:41:53.383]  Now they admitted back in February, listen to this,
[02:41:54.073 --> 02:42:11.678]  Lost in the hyper-politicized hullabaloo surrounding the Nunes Memorandum and the Steele dossier was a striking statement by Secretary of Defense James Mattis that the US has, quote, no evidence, as his words, no evidence that the Syrian government used the banned nerve agent sarin gas against its own people.
[02:42:11.678 --> 02:42:23.381]  This assertion flies in the face of the White House NSC Memorandum, which was rapidly produced, again with no investigation, and declassified to justify an American Tomahawk missile strike against the Shayrat Air Base in Syria.
[02:42:24.071 --> 02:42:26.952]  So we're in the exact same situation again.
[02:42:26.952 --> 02:42:29.374]  There's no independent investigation.
[02:42:29.374 --> 02:42:31.114]  Oh, but it must have been Assad, right?
[02:42:31.114 --> 02:42:32.235]  Who else could it be?
[02:42:32.235 --> 02:42:35.196]  Well, no, you got it completely wrong the last time out.
[02:42:35.196 --> 02:42:36.677]  You lied to the American people.
[02:42:36.677 --> 02:42:38.098]  You lied to the world.
[02:42:38.098 --> 02:42:39.979]  And we're heading into something even bigger now.
[02:42:39.979 --> 02:42:42.820]  This could lead to absolute chaos.
[02:42:42.820 --> 02:42:44.941]  And we're just sleepwalking into it once again.
[02:42:44.941 --> 02:42:46.802]  Nobody seems to care.
[02:42:46.802 --> 02:42:48.363]  We'll get more into it after the break.
[02:42:48.363 --> 02:42:49.063]  We're Syrian Girl.
[02:42:49.063 --> 02:42:50.764]  This is the Alex Jones Show Live.
[02:42:50.764 --> 02:42:51.284]  Don't go away.
[02:42:58.186 --> 02:42:59.587]  Let's go to Devin in Florida.
[02:42:59.587 --> 02:43:01.808]  Devin in Florida, you're on the air.
[02:43:01.808 --> 02:43:02.269]  Great!
[02:43:02.269 --> 02:43:03.389]  Hey, thank you so much.
[02:43:03.389 --> 02:43:07.933]  Listen, I have bought your products, and I gotta say, they're amazing.
[02:43:07.933 --> 02:43:09.634]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it.
[02:43:09.634 --> 02:43:17.199]  Because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret Swirl, 5mm Fusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[02:43:17.199 --> 02:43:17.939]  Wow, thank you.
[02:43:17.939 --> 02:43:20.441]  You're the top of the list that makes it all possible.
[02:43:20.441 --> 02:43:22.002]  Which super-ceutical do you like best?
[02:43:22.242 --> 02:43:25.723]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, to be honest.
[02:43:25.723 --> 02:43:27.004]  That's really incredible.
[02:43:27.004 --> 02:43:30.065]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[02:43:30.065 --> 02:43:31.405]  Like, I haven't felt sleep.
[02:43:31.405 --> 02:43:33.066]  My morning was fantastic.
[02:43:33.066 --> 02:43:34.327]  And I love you guys.
[02:43:34.327 --> 02:43:36.467]  I love the Info Wars crew.
[02:43:36.467 --> 02:43:42.189]  And I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence.
[02:43:42.189 --> 02:43:43.330]  Just buy it.
[02:43:43.330 --> 02:43:44.370]  You will love it.
[02:43:44.370 --> 02:43:44.870]  I'm telling you.
[02:43:44.870 --> 02:43:46.171]  I've never bought a bad product.
[02:43:46.491 --> 02:43:50.923]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at Infowarslife.com.
[02:43:50.923 --> 02:43:51.806]  It's a win-win.
[02:43:51.806 --> 02:43:52.768]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:43:55.316 --> 02:43:59.717]  Fuel your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[02:43:59.717 --> 02:44:07.799]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestion process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[02:44:07.799 --> 02:44:13.100]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[02:44:13.100 --> 02:44:15.620]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[02:44:15.620 --> 02:44:19.841]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[02:44:19.841 --> 02:44:22.282]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[02:44:22.970 --> 02:44:30.213]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[02:44:30.213 --> 02:44:38.276]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[02:44:38.276 --> 02:44:45.459]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[02:44:45.459 --> 02:44:46.920]  Don't let a meal go to waste.

[02:45:02.911 --> 02:45:11.317]  Going back about five years ago, we did research on what top-selling nootropics were, what were most popular, what were best, what people liked, and we made it even stronger.
[02:45:11.317 --> 02:45:16.401]  Then we cut the price because leading competitors have five to seven times markup.
[02:45:16.401 --> 02:45:17.141]  We only have 150%.
[02:45:17.141 --> 02:45:18.262]  Then it helps fund our operation.
[02:45:20.123 --> 02:45:22.945]  Well, now it's 50% off.
[02:45:22.945 --> 02:45:31.390]  That means we've got a 25% markup and we've got it paired with the real red pill that takes about seven days to kick in.
[02:45:31.390 --> 02:45:33.191]  Rainforest takes about 30 minutes.
[02:45:33.191 --> 02:45:34.691]  But the two go together.
[02:45:34.691 --> 02:45:36.733]  It's the Mind and Body Challenge.
[02:45:36.733 --> 02:45:45.658]  They're both 50% off individually or together they're 50% off and free shipping with the combo at InfoHorseLife.com.
[02:45:46.198 --> 02:45:51.380]  But it's got to end in a couple days, because both of these bestsellers are about to sell out.

[02:46:07.468 --> 02:46:14.974]  One of them is a powerful pro-digestive enzyme, Carnivore, for being able to break down meat and other proteins better.
[02:46:14.974 --> 02:46:24.882]  And then the other two is a powerful 50 billion live probiotic culture of the very best strains in Floralife Advanced Restoration.

[02:46:59.276 --> 02:47:01.899]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:11.616 --> 02:47:16.419]  Broadcasting live from the UN stronghold, Austin, Texas.
[02:47:16.419 --> 02:47:20.201]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:20.201 --> 02:47:26.705]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:47:26.705 --> 02:47:31.047]  So we have the USS Donald Cook Destroyer.
[02:47:31.047 --> 02:47:37.971]  Armed with 60 Tomahawk missiles, just 100 kilometers from the Russian naval base of Tartus in Syria.
[02:47:38.570 --> 02:47:41.652]  We have Russian jets reportedly harassing that U.S.
[02:47:41.652 --> 02:47:42.953]  destroyer.
[02:47:42.953 --> 02:47:48.457]  And now we have this, and I just tweeted this out on my Prison Planet Twitter account out of harass.
[02:47:48.457 --> 02:47:50.818]  Senior Russian lawmaker, U.S.
[02:47:50.818 --> 02:47:55.841]  strike on Syria could trigger direct military clash with Russia.
[02:47:55.841 --> 02:47:57.002]  Oh joy!
[02:47:57.002 --> 02:47:58.663]  Senior Russian lawmaker says U.S.
[02:47:58.663 --> 02:48:01.605]  strike could trigger direct military clash with Russia.
[02:48:01.605 --> 02:48:07.289]  This is Vladimir Shamanov, a retired general who heads the Defense Affairs Committee in the Lower House of Parliament.
[02:48:08.027 --> 02:48:16.335]  He said in televised remarks today that a US strike in Russia could hurt Russian servicemen and trigger Russian retaliation.
[02:48:16.335 --> 02:48:20.919]  Oh gee, a proxy war between the United States and Russia.
[02:48:20.919 --> 02:48:22.781]  Got that to look forward to by the looks of it.
[02:48:22.781 --> 02:48:28.567]  He said that Russia has the necessary means for that and the Americans and their allies know that quite well.
[02:48:28.567 --> 02:48:30.869]  Now you've seen massive movement of Russian aircraft
[02:48:31.802 --> 02:48:35.945]  Russian naval facilities over the past 24 hours.
[02:48:35.945 --> 02:48:41.489]  Now they're saying if there's a direct confrontation, Russia could well retaliate.
[02:48:41.489 --> 02:48:45.352]  Shamanov emphasized that a retaliatory Russian strike could target U.S.
[02:48:45.352 --> 02:48:48.574]  Navy ships and aircraft.
[02:48:48.574 --> 02:48:51.656]  Of which there are going to be plenty in the region, at least within the next few days.
[02:48:51.656 --> 02:48:54.098]  He added that the use of nuclear weapons is unlikely.
[02:48:54.098 --> 02:48:55.059]  Oh, thanks!
[02:48:55.059 --> 02:48:56.760]  Be thankful for small mercies there.
[02:48:57.648 --> 02:49:00.070]  We're joined by Syrian Girl to talk about this.
[02:49:00.070 --> 02:49:06.815]  Now I want to get back into the specifics of the actual chemical weapons attack, but just touching on that for a second.
[02:49:06.815 --> 02:49:17.103]  You've got Russian ex-retired generals saying if there's a confrontation, Russia could attack US warships, could literally bomb US warships.
[02:49:17.103 --> 02:49:25.090]  We've got Russian fighter jets harassing, doing flybys of US destroyers in the region near the Russian naval base in Tartus.
[02:49:26.084 --> 02:49:34.307]  Do you think this is just rhetoric, or could we actually be seeing the potential for direct conflict between the US and Russia that could lead to a wider war?
[02:49:34.307 --> 02:49:36.808]  What's the risk here?
[02:49:36.808 --> 02:49:39.969]  I think, you know, it's a game of chicken, obviously.
[02:49:39.969 --> 02:49:41.749]  It's brinkmanship.
[02:49:41.749 --> 02:49:46.671]  But at the same time, even a game of chicken can end up with a hot war.
[02:49:46.671 --> 02:49:48.171]  And I think that's very likely.
[02:49:48.171 --> 02:49:50.272]  I mean, Russia has invested a lot
[02:49:50.919 --> 02:49:53.500]  A lot of its troops are all over Syria.
[02:49:53.500 --> 02:49:58.042]  They're inside Syrian military bases.
[02:49:58.042 --> 02:50:06.947]  As you saw, Russian soldiers or security officers were killed by US bombs in the last strike on Syria.
[02:50:06.947 --> 02:50:13.730]  So those weren't directly Russian military, so perhaps because of that, there was a way out of a direct conflict there.
[02:50:14.290 --> 02:50:19.913]  But it's definitely, if the US is going to attack Syria, it is an attack on Russia.
[02:50:19.913 --> 02:50:21.173]  There's no doubt about that.
[02:50:21.173 --> 02:50:24.215]  And it will end up in a wider war.
[02:50:24.215 --> 02:50:42.464]  And they don't really seem to care about that because they think that they can intimidate and brinkmanship their way through by gathering, you know, the UK, France, Saudi Arabia, you know, this team of basically this mafia of thieves and criminals and
[02:50:43.408 --> 02:50:47.393]  The fact that they're gathering these forces, I think, also doesn't bode well.
[02:50:47.393 --> 02:50:50.117]  As you said, it looks like it's not going to be one strike.
[02:50:50.117 --> 02:50:54.983]  It might be a sustained warfare, and we might see now the beginning of World War III.
[02:50:54.983 --> 02:50:59.049]  So it seems that the Deep State has basically won, or is winning.
[02:51:00.879 --> 02:51:10.413]  Well, of course, many people suggested that it could be the deep state pressuring Trump saying, look, you want to prove you're not a Russian agent, you want the Mueller investigation to go away.
[02:51:10.413 --> 02:51:16.603]  And some people have suggested that this had a connection to the arrest for Cohen, his lawyer, yesterday or the search of his files.
[02:51:17.243 --> 02:51:18.845]  You know, this is how you do it.
[02:51:18.845 --> 02:51:25.133]  You strike a blow against Russia, give them a bloody nose, just to prove that you're not a Russian agent.
[02:51:25.133 --> 02:51:29.258]  Of course, you're going to risk World War III, but these people kind of like wars.
[02:51:29.258 --> 02:51:32.482]  It's kind of how they get by, how they make business.
[02:51:32.482 --> 02:51:32.883]  As he said,
[02:51:33.897 --> 02:51:35.739]  Doesn't look like it's going to be a single strike.
[02:51:35.739 --> 02:51:39.002]  That's what happened last time, based on, again, no evidence whatsoever.
[02:51:39.002 --> 02:51:41.424]  You know, they moved all the aircraft out of the way, basically.
[02:51:41.424 --> 02:51:44.247]  They made a hole in the middle of an airfield.
[02:51:44.247 --> 02:51:47.330]  Some people died, but it was by no means a massive attack.
[02:51:47.330 --> 02:51:54.356]  Now we got the Truman Carrier Strike Group and seven warships with cruise missiles heading to the Mediterranean.
[02:51:54.356 --> 02:51:55.998]  They're not going to be there until 22nd of April.
[02:51:57.532 --> 02:52:02.714]  The French President Macron has said they're going to wait two or three days before anything happens.
[02:52:02.714 --> 02:52:18.881]  So it looks like this is a build-up to something absolutely massive, at least way bigger than it was last year, given the kind of heavy artillery that's heading towards that region, or at least is promised to be heading towards that region, from the Saudis, from the UK, from France.
[02:52:19.824 --> 02:52:22.266]  Again, it's all based on absolutely nothing.
[02:52:22.266 --> 02:52:24.427]  This is the fundamental thing that angers me.
[02:52:24.427 --> 02:52:26.028]  The rush to war.
[02:52:26.028 --> 02:52:30.311]  There's no question whatsoever that this was a horrible incident, that people died.
[02:52:30.311 --> 02:52:45.262]  But there's been no investigation, and in fact, yesterday, for the expert who was head of UN Weapons Inspection in Syria, came out, they came out in Swedish media, this didn't get picked up anywhere, we picked it up in English language.
[02:52:45.262 --> 02:52:47.383]  He's called Akka Själström.
[02:52:47.383 --> 02:52:48.224]  He said there was no
[02:52:49.013 --> 02:52:52.315]  Possible benefit for Bashar al-Assad to gain in any way.
[02:52:52.315 --> 02:52:54.017]  He said it feels strange.
[02:52:54.017 --> 02:52:55.378]  They do not need it.
[02:52:55.378 --> 02:52:58.220]  Their tactics were already successful.
[02:52:58.220 --> 02:53:01.502]  And again, same situation as April 2017.
[02:53:01.502 --> 02:53:03.844]  Trump says they're pulling out, regime change off the table.
[02:53:04.504 --> 02:53:14.031]  Syria making gains, taking over new areas, defeating the rebels and suddenly a convenient chemical weapons attack happens that brings down global condemnation.
[02:53:14.031 --> 02:53:18.034]  Do these people not even, can they not even put two and two together at this point?
[02:53:18.034 --> 02:53:22.617]  Let's get back into it though because you mentioned the Army of Islam.
[02:53:22.617 --> 02:53:24.219]  This is one of the moderate groups.
[02:53:24.219 --> 02:53:26.000]  Okay, this is a group, correct me if I'm wrong.
[02:53:26.607 --> 02:53:29.588]  They're exterminating Shia Muslims, Alawites.
[02:53:29.588 --> 02:53:31.749]  They want Sharia law in Syria.
[02:53:31.749 --> 02:53:35.511]  They want to impose, in their own words, an Islamic state.
[02:53:35.511 --> 02:53:37.091]  They're taking hostages.
[02:53:37.091 --> 02:53:41.553]  They're putting them in cages, parading them around, putting them in tunnels.
[02:53:41.553 --> 02:53:42.994]  And these are the moderate rebels.
[02:53:42.994 --> 02:53:48.036]  These are the people who we're now talking about striking a country in support of.
[02:53:48.036 --> 02:53:48.756]  Correct or not?
[02:53:50.021 --> 02:53:51.522]  Well, absolutely.
[02:53:51.522 --> 02:53:59.084]  And this group, the hostages that they stole from the nearby towns, they include Alawites, Christians and Sunnis.
[02:53:59.084 --> 02:54:07.166]  Basically anyone they perceive to be pro-government or has any relative that's working for the government was kidnapped, no matter their religion.
[02:54:07.166 --> 02:54:11.127]  But this group, you know, they are related to Ahrar al-Sham.
[02:54:11.707 --> 02:54:15.071]  Which is of course, as you know, a group that is linked to Al-Qaeda.
[02:54:15.071 --> 02:54:18.415]  So it's like a three degrees of separation between them and Al-Qaeda.
[02:54:18.415 --> 02:54:20.637]  And of course they're run by Saudi Arabia.
[02:54:20.637 --> 02:54:25.984]  So it's interesting, like as you said, this looks like a massive strike.
[02:54:25.984 --> 02:54:29.628]  It's important to note that yesterday Israel struck Syria.
[02:54:29.628 --> 02:54:31.390]  It struck T4 airbase.
[02:54:31.390 --> 02:54:32.271]  That airbase is
[02:54:32.771 --> 02:54:37.414]  Specifically for the defense of their reserve from ISIS.
[02:54:37.414 --> 02:54:43.578]  It basically manufactures the drones that attack ISIS in the area.
[02:54:43.578 --> 02:54:51.683]  And you know, an ISIS offensive was launched in conjunction to that attack as they probably, you know, always take advantage of it.
[02:54:52.083 --> 02:54:56.785]  So, like, ISIS is still a problem, Al-Qaeda is still a problem, and all this is happening.
[02:54:56.785 --> 02:55:08.949]  And, you know, it's interesting that, you know, you might say that, oh, Israel is against Islamists and Al-Qaeda is against Israel's interests, but they've been giving Al-Qaeda medical treatment in the Golan Heights.
[02:55:08.949 --> 02:55:15.792]  And Israel and Saudi Arabia have the best relations now that they've ever had, because they both oppose Syria and Iran.
[02:55:17.152 --> 02:55:20.813]  In Saudi Arabia's case, it opposes Iran because they're Shiites, and that's it.
[02:55:20.813 --> 02:55:22.313]  That's the only reason.
[02:55:22.313 --> 02:55:35.975]  So, I think that in this scenario, the chemical attack provides the best excuse for the deep state to keep the US military in the northeast of Syria.
[02:55:35.975 --> 02:55:41.376]  And this comes a week after the first US soldier dies in Syria.
[02:55:41.376 --> 02:55:42.357]  This was a week ago.
[02:55:42.357 --> 02:55:44.797]  A US and a UK soldier were killed.
[02:55:45.478 --> 02:55:53.951]  And so this chemical attack is again timely because of course there's going to be a discussion of why are the troops there and why are they dying.
[02:55:53.951 --> 02:55:56.996]  So there's that and I wanted to just
[02:55:57.617 --> 02:55:59.659]  Comment about Axelstrom.
[02:55:59.659 --> 02:56:14.751]  You know, also what he said in 2013, in that very big chemical attack in Damascus, he said that it was very strange that that attack happened on the same day that the OPCW had arrived.
[02:56:14.751 --> 02:56:17.874]  You see, the OPCW didn't arrive after that attack.
[02:56:18.354 --> 02:56:31.763]  They arrived before that attack because they were there to investigate another incident in which chemical weapons were used in Aleppo against Syrian government soldiers and on a Syrian government-held area.
[02:56:31.763 --> 02:56:32.884]  That's what they were there to do.
[02:56:32.884 --> 02:56:36.946]  And on the date they arrived in Damascus, the chemical attack happened.
[02:56:36.946 --> 02:56:40.148]  So he said himself that he thought it was strange.
[02:56:40.148 --> 02:56:44.651]  So there's been all of these coincidences that aren't really coincidences, as we know.
[02:56:47.012 --> 02:56:59.550]  What's hypocritical and bizarre is that the US government, some departments actually acknowledge that the rebels possess chemical weapons because if you were to look at the
[02:57:02.193 --> 02:57:05.334]  Travel advisory to Syria that was released by the U.S.
[02:57:05.334 --> 02:57:12.718]  State Department, it said that, beware, chemical weapons are being used by both sides.
[02:57:12.718 --> 02:57:21.782]  So, they say one thing when it comes to the United Nations and when it comes to their people, and then on the other hand they have something completely different when it comes to the travel warning.
[02:57:23.490 --> 02:57:35.097]  Now I want to get into this more because the only evidence that this entire plot, this insane plot of bombing a country is based on is unverified footage, basically from a group called the White Helmets.
[02:57:35.097 --> 02:57:39.700]  Let's get into the White Helmets and what they're all about in the next segment, Talking to Syrian Girl.
[02:57:39.700 --> 02:57:42.981]  This is the Alex Jones Show live, InfoWars.com.
[02:57:42.981 --> 02:57:43.502]  We'll be back.
[02:57:46.425 --> 02:57:51.910]  The reason InfoWarsLive has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[02:57:51.910 --> 02:57:52.750]  I take this.
[02:57:52.750 --> 02:57:53.891]  My family takes this.
[02:57:53.891 --> 02:57:58.175]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.
[02:57:58.175 --> 02:58:02.619]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:58:02.779 --> 02:58:07.421]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[02:58:07.421 --> 02:58:08.542]  I don't feel good.
[02:58:08.542 --> 02:58:12.303]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[02:58:12.303 --> 02:58:14.984]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[02:58:14.984 --> 02:58:20.787]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[02:58:20.787 --> 02:58:23.748]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[02:58:23.748 --> 02:58:27.290]  And I know my hair is a little luxurious once again.
[02:58:27.290 --> 02:58:29.511]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[02:58:29.511 --> 02:58:29.871]  I love it.
[02:58:30.031 --> 02:58:32.855]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[02:58:32.855 --> 02:58:33.856]  Survival Shield X2.
[02:58:33.856 --> 02:58:39.803]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[02:58:39.803 --> 02:58:41.686]  It's got a five-star rating.
[02:58:41.686 --> 02:58:43.889]  It's a win-win in fullwarslife.com.
[02:58:46.482 --> 02:59:05.318]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from Infowarsstore.com, you are funding
[02:59:05.658 --> 02:59:06.458]  The revolution.
[02:59:06.458 --> 02:59:08.559]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[02:59:08.559 --> 02:59:12.300]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:59:12.300 --> 02:59:19.822]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.

[02:59:29.205 --> 02:59:30.785]  And you're purchasing the products
[02:59:33.886 --> 02:59:39.312]  Stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[02:59:39.312 --> 02:59:49.343]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[02:59:49.343 --> 02:59:51.946]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:58.008 --> 03:00:08.194]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:08.194 --> 03:00:14.999]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:00:14.999 --> 03:00:21.022]  We are live, and we are into the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show, talking to Sirian Girl.
[03:00:21.022 --> 03:00:23.364]  She is at Partisan Girl on Twitter.
[03:00:24.162 --> 03:00:24.462]  U.S.
[03:00:24.462 --> 03:00:27.705]  destroyers basically right outside the Russian naval airbase.
[03:00:27.705 --> 03:00:31.167]  Retired Russian generals saying Russia could strike U.S.
[03:00:31.167 --> 03:00:31.647]  ships.
[03:00:31.647 --> 03:00:35.450]  Obviously creating a proxy war at the very least.
[03:00:35.450 --> 03:00:37.712]  Massive situation right now in Syria.
[03:00:37.712 --> 03:00:41.034]  It's going to spiral out of control if things continue heading the way they are.
[03:00:41.034 --> 03:00:43.516]  If cooler heads don't prevail.
[03:00:43.516 --> 03:00:46.598]  Now I'm looking at a headline here from Reuters.
[03:00:46.598 --> 03:00:49.780]  This is out of Reuters May 5th 2013 headline.
[03:00:51.673 --> 03:00:55.836]  UN has testimony that Syrian rebels used sarin gas.
[03:00:55.836 --> 03:01:07.203]  UN human rights investigators have gathered testimony from casualties of Syria's civil war and medical staff, indicating that rebel forces have used the nerve agent sarin, one of the lead investigators said on Sunday.
[03:01:08.061 --> 03:01:09.983]  Now this is Carla Del Ponte.
[03:01:09.983 --> 03:01:15.947]  She said this, quote, Our investigators have been in neighbouring countries interviewing victims, doctors and field hospitals.
[03:01:15.947 --> 03:01:24.695]  And according to their report last week, which I've seen, there are strong concrete suspicions but not yet incontrovertible proof of the use of sarin gas from the way the victims are treated.
[03:01:24.695 --> 03:01:30.739]  This was used on the part of the opposition, the rebels, not by government authorities.
[03:01:30.739 --> 03:01:33.642]  That's the UN that said that five years ago.
[03:01:34.002 --> 03:01:44.070]  We have documented cases, 52 plus by the end of 2016 alone, of ISIS factions in Syria using chemical weapons.
[03:01:44.070 --> 03:01:49.194]  Oh, but who would believe that this attack could possibly have been a false flag, right?
[03:01:49.194 --> 03:01:51.736]  That's just off-the-planet thinking.
[03:01:51.736 --> 03:02:03.005]  And Maram, isn't it true, and this was in my video, that they discovered an actual rebel chemical weapons factory in this same region where this attack happened just a few weeks ago?
[03:02:05.367 --> 03:02:06.628]  That's exactly right.
[03:02:06.628 --> 03:02:18.033]  As they were taking over new and new areas, they basically came across what seems like a chemical weapons lab filled with bottles full of chlorine.
[03:02:18.033 --> 03:02:20.255]  This was all filmed.
[03:02:20.255 --> 03:02:21.575]  The footage is online.
[03:02:21.575 --> 03:02:26.778]  You could see that the place was basically untouched except by rubble.
[03:02:26.778 --> 03:02:30.860]  And it's perfectly clear that anyone can make chemicals.
[03:02:30.860 --> 03:02:32.741]  I mean, these guys are making makeshift bombs.
[03:02:33.510 --> 03:02:34.810]  They have the capability.
[03:02:34.810 --> 03:02:39.812]  They've been making gas cylinder bombs for the last five years.
[03:02:39.812 --> 03:02:48.695]  And on top of which, I'm sure that they have help from intelligence agencies from many countries that have an interest to see this war continue.
[03:02:48.695 --> 03:02:53.437]  So I have no... There's really... It's who benefits and who has the means.
[03:02:54.057 --> 03:02:59.541]  It's the rebels and the security agencies that want the war to continue.
[03:02:59.541 --> 03:03:13.330]  And if you look at, you know, who are the voices that are pushing for the war, it's coming from people like Tony Blair, who caused the Iraq War and... Because he can be trusted on interventions in the Middle East, right?
[03:03:13.330 --> 03:03:17.833]  Tony Blair, he's got a perfect track record of foreign interventions in the Middle East.
[03:03:17.833 --> 03:03:19.434]  Let's all listen to him.
[03:03:19.434 --> 03:03:20.835]  That's a great idea, right?
[03:03:21.872 --> 03:03:26.534]  Exactly, and he made his case for the Iraq war based on what?
[03:03:26.534 --> 03:03:28.715]  Chemical weapons, WMDs.
[03:03:28.715 --> 03:03:39.140]  It's almost like chemical weapons and WMDs is the only excuse that they have to start wars, either that or creating democracies.
[03:03:39.140 --> 03:03:44.242]  But it seems to be used over and over and over again, including with the Skripal case.
[03:03:45.083 --> 03:04:01.059]  What's interesting with the Skrpa case where they accused Russia of attempting to assassinate an ex-spy with a chemical weapon is that just a day prior to this chemical attack, a story came out trying to link
[03:04:01.839 --> 03:04:11.002]  Syria to this assassination of a Russian spy in the UK, and they're trying to make a connection between Syria and Russia and chemical weapons.
[03:04:11.002 --> 03:04:19.885]  I don't know why it's always chemical weapons, but I think it has to do with the fact that a lot of the time, before they invade a country, they want a disarmament of chemical weapons.
[03:04:21.152 --> 03:04:30.435]  Well, some people have also suggested, and in fact, I think it was Akerson that said this, it would be difficult to investigate this attack because of the use of chlorine.
[03:04:30.435 --> 03:04:36.496]  The effects of it disappear rapidly in the victims, so maybe that's another reason why it's convenient to use this.
[03:04:36.496 --> 03:04:42.818]  We'll get more into it after the break with Sirian Girl, talk about the White Helmets, talk about where this is going geopolitically.
[03:04:42.818 --> 03:04:44.519]  This is the Alex Jones Show Live.
[03:04:44.519 --> 03:04:46.059]  We'll be back after the break.
[03:04:46.059 --> 03:04:47.840]  BreakingNewsInfoWars.com.
[03:04:47.840 --> 03:04:48.380]  Don't go away.
[03:04:54.241 --> 03:04:57.663]  Introducing CellForce by InfoWars Life.
[03:04:57.663 --> 03:05:01.626]  CellForce focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[03:05:01.626 --> 03:05:04.968]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[03:05:04.968 --> 03:05:07.510]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[03:05:07.510 --> 03:05:11.873]  CellForce helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[03:05:12.233 --> 03:05:21.603]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul, because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[03:05:21.603 --> 03:05:28.770]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[03:05:29.771 --> 03:05:34.836]  The antioxidants found in CellForce are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[03:05:34.836 --> 03:05:42.483]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[03:05:42.483 --> 03:05:47.408]  Boost, protect and adapt with CellForce from InfoWars Life.
[03:05:47.408 --> 03:05:50.311]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[03:06:01.457 --> 03:06:02.677]  You found it.
[03:06:02.677 --> 03:06:04.718]  The tip of the spear.
[03:06:04.718 --> 03:06:07.738]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:07.738 --> 03:06:14.940]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:06:14.940 --> 03:06:17.000]  We're gonna do one more segment here.
[03:06:17.000 --> 03:06:23.262]  Maybe we'll stretch it into two segments with Siri and Gil talking about the imminent attack on Syria is what it looks like.
[03:06:23.262 --> 03:06:24.662]  Here's a tweet from airlive.net.
[03:06:25.780 --> 03:06:36.407]  According to reports, British forces are mobilising at their bases in Cyprus and Rafale fighter jets could take off from Saint-Dizier Air Base in France for possible strikes against Syria.
[03:06:36.407 --> 03:06:41.750]  So it looks like it's not going to be this symbolic one strike that we had in April last year.
[03:06:41.750 --> 03:06:45.092]  Again, as a result of another chemical weapons attack that was completely unproven.
[03:06:45.092 --> 03:06:47.374]  Looks like this is a global effort.
[03:06:47.734 --> 03:06:57.421]  Could they actually be trying to still unseat a regime change in Syria, given how disastrous it was in Iraq, given how disastrous it was in Libya?
[03:06:57.421 --> 03:06:59.603]  We're talking to Syrian girl right now.
[03:06:59.603 --> 03:07:00.664]  And the evidence for all this
[03:07:01.323 --> 03:07:02.784]  Basically comes from one source.
[03:07:02.784 --> 03:07:10.329]  They said it was unverified footage and then it was footage from the White Helmets from the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
[03:07:10.329 --> 03:07:17.473]  These are all groups completely aligned with the regime change agenda, completely aligned with rebel factions.
[03:07:18.013 --> 03:07:23.236]  In some cases aligned with actual ISIS factions, they have been from the very start.
[03:07:23.236 --> 03:07:29.879]  And this is the neutral independent group that we're supposed to believe has the complete impartial evidence on all this.
[03:07:29.879 --> 03:07:32.141]  Maram, tell us about the White Helmets.
[03:07:32.141 --> 03:07:36.143]  Can the White Helmets really be trusted?
[03:07:36.143 --> 03:07:42.206]  Well, the White Helmets are basically the Army of Islam or Al-Qaeda
[03:07:42.955 --> 03:07:44.859]  Basically putting on a white helmet.
[03:07:44.859 --> 03:07:46.602]  That's all it is.
[03:07:46.602 --> 03:07:54.096]  The group has been filmed waving Al-Qaeda flags at an Al-Qaeda rally, carrying weapons,
[03:07:54.992 --> 03:08:12.244]  Torturing Syrian soldiers, holding up severed heads of Syrian soldiers and faking video footage multiple times of chemical attacks and saving, rescuing children and rescuing each other.
[03:08:12.244 --> 03:08:15.747]  They did a very silly video of themselves.
[03:08:16.684 --> 03:08:28.837]  Basically frozen in time rescuing this guy and later he comes out and he's like, oh, I'm fine, but he's acting during the rescue was as if though he was very much in pain and very used to acting.
[03:08:28.837 --> 03:08:30.939]  I mean, it's no wonder they won an Oscar, isn't it?
[03:08:34.180 --> 03:08:35.541]  It's all because they asked.
[03:08:35.541 --> 03:08:36.963]  And who runs this group?
[03:08:36.963 --> 03:08:38.304]  Who invented it?
[03:08:38.304 --> 03:08:40.586]  Who gave Al-Qaeda these white helmets?
[03:08:40.586 --> 03:08:45.109]  Well, it's an MI6 agent named James LeMessurier.
[03:08:45.109 --> 03:08:51.755]  And of course, the group is funded by Holland, the US, the UK.
[03:08:51.755 --> 03:08:57.720]  And it's interesting that Holland, actually, the United Nations said, oh, this is a very trustworthy group.
[03:08:57.720 --> 03:09:00.382]  Well, of course, they'd say that because they're the ones who are paying them.
[03:09:02.338 --> 03:09:10.773]  You know, again, like this video that came out, there's no way to verify whether it happened just yesterday or...
[03:09:12.452 --> 03:09:18.235]  Last year, or six months ago, there's no date on it, there's been no bodies that came out.
[03:09:18.235 --> 03:09:20.617]  I mean, the group actually surrendered Douma.
[03:09:20.617 --> 03:09:27.701]  The Russians are completely in Douma, and there's nothing to show where these people died.
[03:09:27.701 --> 03:09:36.466]  The video did reveal, you know, the corpses were actually under the ground, and near them was a gas-burning stove.
[03:09:36.986 --> 03:09:43.149]  And if you're burning wood under the ground, it doesn't even have to be sarin, it doesn't even have to be chlorine.
[03:09:43.149 --> 03:09:45.389]  It could be something as simple as carbon monoxide.
[03:09:45.389 --> 03:09:56.314]  And it's unfortunate that they chose basically to kill children because they can't fight back and they make the best false flag imagery.
[03:09:56.314 --> 03:10:01.436]  And what would Assad benefit from gassing kids if it's going to basically spark World War 3?
[03:10:03.731 --> 03:10:17.520]  The sheer lack of number of people who are asking that question in the mainstream media, it's just so obviously not in his favour to do this when they were clearing out the region of Eastern Ghouta.
[03:10:17.520 --> 03:10:18.920]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:10:18.920 --> 03:10:21.242]  People just aren't asking the question though.
[03:10:21.242 --> 03:10:24.624]  Now we've got this potential for this war to explode.
[03:10:24.624 --> 03:10:27.025]  We've got all these different countries getting involved.
[03:10:27.025 --> 03:10:31.108]  We've also got the wider propaganda war which is being fought obviously on the internet.
[03:10:31.668 --> 03:10:37.072]  We had a poll yesterday, a Fox News poll, and I voted in this poll, I retweeted this poll.
[03:10:37.072 --> 03:10:44.677]  It was consistently throughout the day, 65% against military intervention in Syria, throughout the whole day.
[03:10:44.677 --> 03:10:49.781]  Then in like the final few hours of this poll being active, it suddenly flipped!
[03:10:49.781 --> 03:10:51.162]  Now what happened with that poll?
[03:10:52.990 --> 03:11:03.054]  Well, there's this guy that is basically a journalist for the Muslim Brotherhood who has 500,000 followers on Twitter.
[03:11:03.054 --> 03:11:09.177]  And he tweeted this poll and said, guys vote yes for war against Syria.
[03:11:09.177 --> 03:11:17.481]  And after he tweeted that, there was a massive surge of like 80,000 votes within the span of one to two hours.
[03:11:18.041 --> 03:11:29.354]  And even though his tweet, you know, had a large retweet number, like a thousand favorites, 500 retweets, I don't think that by itself would have been enough.
[03:11:29.354 --> 03:11:31.557]  I would hazard a guess that they used bots.
[03:11:32.898 --> 03:11:39.804]  So this is supposed to be a poll for Fox News viewers and you're having the Muslim Brotherhood come in and vote for war.
[03:11:39.804 --> 03:11:51.473]  And isn't it interesting that the neocons are on the side of what the Muslim Brotherhood want and John McCain and the neocon Republicans are all now on the same side of Al-Qaeda?
[03:11:51.473 --> 03:11:56.157]  And they have been for the past six years since we've been talking about this.
[03:11:56.790 --> 03:11:57.711]  OK, let's wrap it up.
[03:11:57.711 --> 03:11:58.732]  Just final comments.
[03:11:58.732 --> 03:11:59.794]  Where do you see this going?
[03:11:59.794 --> 03:12:04.179]  I mean, do you see it as a limited strike, as kind of a symbolic thing like we saw last year?
[03:12:04.179 --> 03:12:10.106]  Or do you see them actually, even at this late stage, still trying this regime change effort?
[03:12:10.106 --> 03:12:12.809]  Where do you see this going in the medium and long term?
[03:12:14.565 --> 03:12:19.808]  I think, you know, it's very difficult because the emotions are running high right now, but I think what the U.S.
[03:12:19.808 --> 03:12:25.651]  wants is somehow to remain in the northeast of Syria for a prolonged period of time.
[03:12:25.651 --> 03:12:31.014]  Perhaps this intimidation tactic is an attempt to get some kind of negotiations towards that.
[03:12:31.794 --> 03:12:36.936]  Maybe it'll be a small strike, but I would say that we shouldn't treat it as that.
[03:12:36.936 --> 03:12:39.056]  Because a small strike is still a strike.
[03:12:39.056 --> 03:12:51.220]  I mean, there's been consistent strikes and degradation of Syrian defenses and strengthening of ISIS and Al-Qaeda, the perpetuation of the war, the creation of refugees.
[03:12:51.220 --> 03:12:52.761]  It's not in anyone's interest.
[03:12:52.761 --> 03:12:56.862]  So we should treat this as though it is going to be a big strike and as though it might
[03:12:58.282 --> 03:13:04.925]  Because it might do that and if we don't treat it as such and we don't act now, we may live to regret the day.
[03:13:04.925 --> 03:13:16.130]  So I would say that if you can, call your local governments, call the White House, do whatever you can, what is in your power to try to resist and show opposition to this.
[03:13:16.830 --> 03:13:26.292]  It might not be for, it might not work because I hazard a guess that the US deep state, you know, democracy is basically dead.
[03:13:26.292 --> 03:13:32.333]  But it's, you know, it's better than nothing and we have to do what we can with the limited power that we have.
[03:13:32.333 --> 03:13:39.874]  So let's stand against this because there's a 50-50 chance it's going to be World War 3.
[03:13:39.874 --> 03:13:40.374]  Amazing.
[03:13:40.374 --> 03:13:45.195]  Matt, just tell people in the final minute here how they can find you on social media and on YouTube.
[03:13:47.021 --> 03:13:49.024]  Thanks so much for having me on the show.
[03:13:49.024 --> 03:13:54.491]  Find me at Partisan Girl on Twitter and Syrian Girl Partisan on YouTube.
[03:13:54.491 --> 03:14:02.781]  I'm also on Bitchute Syrian Girl and on Mines Syrian Girl or Partisan Girl and a bunch of other things.
[03:14:02.781 --> 03:14:06.085]  So please check out my Twitter and add me on those.
[03:14:07.515 --> 03:14:09.816]  Okay, we really appreciate you, Syrian Girl.
[03:14:09.816 --> 03:14:16.017]  We'll get you back on as this unfolds, which it inevitably will over the next few days, maybe even starting tonight.
[03:14:16.017 --> 03:14:17.378]  But thanks for joining us today.
[03:14:17.378 --> 03:14:18.838]  Thank you.
[03:14:18.838 --> 03:14:20.599]  Thanks so much.
[03:14:20.599 --> 03:14:22.619]  Okay, there goes Syrian Girl.
[03:14:22.619 --> 03:14:27.381]  We have about a minute and a half left in this segment, so let's go back to this news again.
[03:14:27.381 --> 03:14:28.941]  Massive headline out of Horetz.
[03:14:28.941 --> 03:14:30.362]  Senior Russian lawmaker.
[03:14:30.362 --> 03:14:34.503]  US strike on Syria could trigger direct military clash with Russia.
[03:14:34.503 --> 03:14:35.363]  He's basically saying
[03:14:36.084 --> 03:14:40.707]  He's emphasising that a retaliatory Russian strike could target US Navy ships and aircraft.
[03:14:40.707 --> 03:14:47.952]  He's saying that Russia could bomb US Navy destroyers if they target Syrian government positions.
[03:14:47.952 --> 03:14:50.554]  That is absolutely massive.
[03:14:50.554 --> 03:14:54.277]  We also have Trump cancelling his trip to South Africa
[03:14:55.006 --> 03:15:00.027]  President Trump has cancelled his scheduled trip to multiple South American countries originally planned for this week.
[03:15:00.027 --> 03:15:01.768]  The White House said Tuesday.
[03:15:01.768 --> 03:15:03.368]  So Trump's going to be in place.
[03:15:03.368 --> 03:15:07.430]  He was set to attend the 8th Summit of the Americas in Lima, Peru and then go to Colombia.
[03:15:07.430 --> 03:15:12.471]  He's not going to do that because he's got things on his plate and we all know what they are.
[03:15:13.504 --> 03:15:15.785]  We have report Russia jams U.S.
[03:15:15.785 --> 03:15:17.945]  drones over Syria to thwart airstrikes.
[03:15:17.945 --> 03:15:20.686]  The Russian military has figured out how to jam some U.S.
[03:15:20.686 --> 03:15:23.027]  military drones in airspace over Syria.
[03:15:23.027 --> 03:15:24.568]  NBC News report on Tuesday.
[03:15:24.568 --> 03:15:32.990]  So, the Russians are very busy boys right now as this potential World War III scenario escalates.
[03:15:32.990 --> 03:15:35.831]  Really not that many people are talking about it until it happens.
[03:15:35.831 --> 03:15:41.433]  There doesn't seem to be as much interest around it, as much concern around it, as there should be right now.
[03:15:41.973 --> 03:15:44.516]  Absolutely incredible times we're living in.
[03:15:44.516 --> 03:15:46.057]  This is the Alex Jones Show Live.

[03:15:53.311 --> 03:15:55.171]  Healthcare reform is confusing.

[03:17:54.229 --> 03:17:57.972]  We need to fund this operation, ladies and gentlemen, and I make it really easy.
[03:17:57.972 --> 03:18:05.036]  We went out and looked at what the top nootropics or brain pills are that are healthy for energy, stamina, mental clarity, you name it.
[03:18:05.036 --> 03:18:09.780]  And we created a stronger formula than some of the best-selling formulas out there.
[03:18:09.780 --> 03:18:10.540]  It's very simple.
[03:18:10.540 --> 03:18:13.022]  We went out and looked at what is the top, what is the best.

[03:18:26.851 --> 03:18:31.115]  Believe me, we're selling it for $35 on average.
[03:18:31.115 --> 03:18:34.958]  We need that $15, $20 we make to fund this operation in the face of the Globals, the rest of it.
[03:18:34.958 --> 03:18:38.841]  But I'm doing this because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks.

[03:18:49.249 --> 03:18:51.851]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or AAA2533139.
[03:18:55.106 --> 03:19:03.650]  Alex Jones here with an extremely exciting announcement that will be a gift to yourself and a gift to the InfoWar to fight the globalists and live in a free society.

[03:20:09.046 --> 03:20:11.388]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:20:22.426 --> 03:20:25.127]  We're live on the Alex Jones Show, fourth hour.
[03:20:25.127 --> 03:20:32.970]  Before I get back into the news, I want to direct you to InfoWarsStore.com, where we have a number of great discounts on great products right now.
[03:20:32.970 --> 03:20:34.791]  And you can read all the five-star reviews for these.

[03:20:39.440 --> 03:20:43.405]  This is the medicinal herb used for thousands of years, turmeric.
[03:20:43.405 --> 03:20:45.667]  One of the most studied ingredients known today.
[03:20:45.667 --> 03:20:53.397]  After a long search for the perfect turmeric formula, we've finally created a way to deliver this incredible ingredient to you for less.
[03:20:53.397 --> 03:20:55.599]  And it is bodies from Infowars Life.

[03:20:59.312 --> 03:21:01.433]  Inflammation support and immune support.
[03:21:01.433 --> 03:21:03.175]  It's got a turmeric root extract.
[03:21:03.175 --> 03:21:11.780]  Again, if you look at scientific studies related to treatment of depression, with this compared to Prozac, you notice which one's more effective.
[03:21:11.780 --> 03:21:20.085]  Now, we don't make those claims for this product, but other people make those claims and they are quite well backed up if you want to look into that aspect of it.
[03:21:20.085 --> 03:21:24.208]  But we offer it for the joint support, the mobility support, it is bodies

[03:22:17.011 --> 03:22:20.932]  It's one of our newest products, but it's one of the fastest selling products we've ever had.
[03:22:20.932 --> 03:22:27.014]  We're dropping it still 25% to help you experience it before it goes back out of stock.
[03:22:27.014 --> 03:22:31.295]  As you age, your body can lose testosterone at rates of 1-2% each year.
[03:22:31.295 --> 03:22:37.317]  That crisis has of course accelerated in the West over the recent couple of decades.
[03:22:37.317 --> 03:22:39.898]  Testosterone levels dropping off rapidly.
[03:22:39.898 --> 03:22:43.679]  That's why we worked hard to make an affordable solution to the greatest problem of age.
[03:22:44.793 --> 03:22:54.736]  Alpha Power works synergistically with Supermail Vitality and Anthroplex to help you become a true alpha male and take charge of your energy to defy age.
[03:22:54.736 --> 03:22:56.877]  So this is going to give you a big energy boost as well.

[03:23:02.038 --> 03:23:07.220]  Take advantage now before it goes out of stock and support this network.
[03:23:08.675 --> 03:23:12.518]  Let's round up with some of this Syria news right now and then I'm going to switch into other subjects.
[03:23:12.518 --> 03:23:19.503]  We should be talking about this for the entire show but nobody seems to be much concerned with it in terms of conservative circles.
[03:23:19.503 --> 03:23:25.628]  They're just going to sit back and watch it happen as we feed more assets into the Middle Eastern meat grinder.
[03:23:25.628 --> 03:23:28.050]  Looks like that's the way it's going to go.
[03:23:28.050 --> 03:23:30.512]  Ron Paul came out and this is out of RT.
[03:23:30.512 --> 03:23:34.675]  Asset had no reason to launch a chemical attack unlike those who want US involvement.
[03:23:35.491 --> 03:23:36.833]  Listen to what Ron Paul said.
[03:23:36.833 --> 03:23:40.460]  He said, I think that least likely it would be Assad.
[03:23:40.460 --> 03:23:42.865]  I cannot see any reason why Assad would do this.
[03:23:42.865 --> 03:23:45.070]  There's no reason for Russians to have done that.
[03:23:45.720 --> 03:23:51.224]  Unlike Russia and Syria, the forces who want to see the US staying in Syria have a clear motive.
[03:23:51.224 --> 03:23:53.926]  Remember, Trump said, we're going to pull the troops out.
[03:23:53.926 --> 03:23:56.628]  A day later, the Pentagon says, no you're not.
[03:23:56.628 --> 03:23:59.751]  We're not even going to give you a timetable to get the troops out.
[03:23:59.751 --> 03:24:00.651]  Then this happens.
[03:24:00.651 --> 03:24:02.933]  And yes, we do have some troops in Syria.
[03:24:02.933 --> 03:24:06.976]  We do have a presence in Syria in terms of the UK and the US.
[03:24:06.976 --> 03:24:08.037]  Now Ron Paul continued.
[03:24:08.976 --> 03:24:12.678]  There are so many who want to stir up trouble and the people who want us to stay there.
[03:24:12.678 --> 03:24:22.922]  Suggesting Trump's recent promise to leave Syria very soon might have prompted Warhawks to take action, just as it did last year, the exact same scenario happened.
[03:24:22.922 --> 03:24:27.644]  He said, I think the policy makers here did not want us to leave and somebody does it for them.
[03:24:27.644 --> 03:24:32.006]  This whole idea that all of a sudden Assad is gassing his own people is a total nonsense.
[03:24:32.745 --> 03:24:34.125]  Again, they were clearing them out.
[03:24:34.125 --> 03:24:35.826]  The rebel factions had surrendered.
[03:24:35.826 --> 03:24:37.286]  They were leaving the area.
[03:24:37.286 --> 03:24:39.927]  Why would they need to do this?
[03:24:39.927 --> 03:24:45.769]  Speaking about what drives the US to keep entrenching in Syria, Paul argued that the ulterior goal is to contain Iran.
[03:24:45.769 --> 03:24:46.909]  It's been Iran for a long time.
[03:24:46.909 --> 03:24:48.550]  It has to do with Saudi Arabia and Iran.
[03:24:48.550 --> 03:24:49.730]  I think that's the number one.
[03:24:49.730 --> 03:24:54.652]  So Ron Paul is all but calling it a false flag, saying that Assad had no reason to carry it out.
[03:24:56.053 --> 03:24:59.714]  And now we have Tony Blair sticking his oar in once again.
[03:24:59.714 --> 03:25:05.455]  This is a guy who's literally got a 7% trust rating in the United Kingdom, Tony Blair.
[03:25:05.455 --> 03:25:12.196]  The guy who led the most disastrous Middle Eastern intervention in living memory.
[03:25:12.196 --> 03:25:16.017]  Why on earth has this guy still got any kind of public platform?
[03:25:16.017 --> 03:25:18.817]  He's been completely discredited.
[03:25:18.817 --> 03:25:24.098]  Tony Blair, UK will have to intervene in Syria or get caught blanched for chemical weapons attacks.
[03:25:25.140 --> 03:25:32.443]  Now this is the guy who makes a living out of being paid by all these defence contractors, all the people who are tied in to weapon sales.
[03:25:32.443 --> 03:25:34.884]  This is how he butters his bread right now.
[03:25:34.884 --> 03:25:40.267]  Tony Blair has declared the UK will have to back any US-led military intervention in Syria.
[03:25:40.267 --> 03:25:44.089]  Even though, by the way, our Parliament voted against that very thing years ago.
[03:25:44.089 --> 03:25:47.450]  Or give carte blanche for the future use of chemical weapons.
[03:25:47.450 --> 03:25:52.533]  The former Prime Minister called for Theresa May to act and said she did not need the approval of MPs through a vote in Parliament.
[03:25:52.533 --> 03:25:52.573]  Oh!
[03:25:54.016 --> 03:25:55.036]  Isn't that interesting?
[03:25:55.036 --> 03:26:07.638]  Because Tony Blair and his ilk, the Ramoners, demand over and over again that MPs in Parliament have to vote on every single facet of Brexit and that they should be able to vote it down.
[03:26:07.638 --> 03:26:13.359]  So when it comes to something that he advocates, stopping Brexit, he's all for democracy.
[03:26:13.359 --> 03:26:18.380]  When it comes to something like the Syria attack, suddenly democracy's off the table, we don't need a vote.
[03:26:18.380 --> 03:26:19.801]  Isn't that interesting?
[03:26:19.801 --> 03:26:21.421]  Why are we listening to this idiot?
[03:26:21.421 --> 03:26:22.241]  He's a war criminal.
[03:26:22.970 --> 03:26:27.313]  He's responsible partly for the most disastrous Middle Eastern intervention in living memory.
[03:26:27.313 --> 03:26:30.175]  Why does he even have a platform?
[03:26:30.175 --> 03:26:31.576]  This is nonsense.
[03:26:31.576 --> 03:26:40.582]  In fact, him getting up and saying this actually discredits the UK intervening, so maybe we should be thanking Tony Blair.
[03:26:40.582 --> 03:26:47.086]  Now, Russia is coming out now and saying, Russia furious as US Navy destroyer approaches Syria without notification.
[03:26:47.086 --> 03:26:50.288]  This, of course, is the USS Donald Cook.
[03:26:50.288 --> 03:26:51.609]  Not Donald Duck, Donald Cook.
[03:26:52.446 --> 03:26:54.848]  And it's got 60 Tomahawk cruise missiles.
[03:26:54.848 --> 03:27:02.835]  It's 100 kilometres from the port of Tartus, which is the Russian Navy base in Syria.
[03:27:02.835 --> 03:27:07.739]  Reports yesterday suggest that Russian fighter jets were harassing this destroyer.
[03:27:07.739 --> 03:27:09.481]  I mean, how close is it to kicking off?
[03:27:09.481 --> 03:27:13.844]  One even accident, and this could kick off big time.
[03:27:13.844 --> 03:27:18.248]  US missile destroyer reportedly sailing towards Syria as Trump weighs options.
[03:27:18.248 --> 03:27:19.009]  There's a seven
[03:27:19.972 --> 03:27:25.636]  Carrier Strike Group, seven warships with cruise missiles heading to the Mediterranean right now.
[03:27:25.636 --> 03:27:32.060]  It says though in this article, which I believe is true, that it's going to take them until April 22nd.
[03:27:32.060 --> 03:27:41.606]  It reads, it's worth noting that it will take approximately six to seven days for the group to cross the Atlantic at 30 knots, plus another three to four days once it arrives in the Mediterranean to reach Syria.
[03:27:42.327 --> 03:27:46.370]  Suggesting a full-blown on-attack may not take place until April 22nd.
[03:27:46.370 --> 03:27:57.960]  Now we're hearing similar noises out of France and out of the UK, where they're saying they're going to wait to make a decision or at least wait a few days before implementing that decision.
[03:27:57.960 --> 03:28:03.665]  So it looks like rather than a snap airstrike, which is what we had last year and then it was done, it was over.
[03:28:04.702 --> 03:28:06.923]  Basically within the space of an hour or two.
[03:28:06.923 --> 03:28:14.106]  This looks like a concentrated, a global effort to undermine, if not remove Bashar al-Assad from office.
[03:28:14.106 --> 03:28:18.768]  They're talking about Saudi Arabia, they're talking about the UK, they're talking about France.
[03:28:18.768 --> 03:28:23.530]  All these forces coming together, all these forces massing, steaming towards Syria.
[03:28:23.530 --> 03:28:28.632]  It could be way bigger than anyone was expecting just a couple of days ago.
[03:28:28.632 --> 03:28:31.793]  And we should be very, very concerned about that prospect.
[03:28:32.453 --> 03:28:36.656]  And again, Bashar al-Assad had no motivation whatsoever to carry out this attack.
[03:28:36.656 --> 03:28:38.757]  Looks like a complete false flag.
[03:28:38.757 --> 03:28:42.259]  Nobody is even talking about that scenario right now.
[03:28:42.259 --> 03:28:45.741]  It's just another mindless rush to war.
[03:28:45.741 --> 03:28:46.301]  We'll be back.
[03:28:46.301 --> 03:28:47.682]  We'll cover some other subjects.
[03:28:47.682 --> 03:28:49.443]  On the other side, this is the Alex Jones Show!

[03:29:23.163 --> 03:29:25.043]  Healthcare reform is confusing.

[03:30:06.079 --> 03:30:09.300]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[03:30:09.300 --> 03:30:10.420]  It's back in stock.

[03:30:23.283 --> 03:30:26.025]  Thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[03:30:53.931 --> 03:30:57.534]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[03:30:57.534 --> 03:30:59.296]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[03:30:59.296 --> 03:31:10.565]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[03:31:11.346 --> 03:31:20.534]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[03:31:20.534 --> 03:31:26.498]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[03:31:26.498 --> 03:31:31.602]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[03:31:31.602 --> 03:31:34.225]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[03:31:34.225 --> 03:31:35.926]  It is not an antihistamine.
[03:31:35.926 --> 03:31:40.750]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase.
[03:31:40.950 --> 03:31:45.913]  Which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[03:31:45.913 --> 03:31:48.554]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[03:31:48.554 --> 03:31:53.257]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block Chewable Tablets.
[03:31:54.420 --> 03:31:55.201]  I'm so excited.
[03:31:55.201 --> 03:32:05.347]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[03:32:05.347 --> 03:32:13.873]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[03:32:13.873 --> 03:32:22.639]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[03:32:24.740 --> 03:32:44.325]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[03:32:44.325 --> 03:32:47.006]  It is amazing!
[03:32:47.006 --> 03:32:51.967]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[03:32:56.681 --> 03:33:07.468]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:07.468 --> 03:33:14.112]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:14.112 --> 03:33:17.774]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:33:21.078 --> 03:33:26.540]  We're live on the Alex Jones Show and something I just retweeted if you want to flash it up there.
[03:33:26.540 --> 03:33:35.143]  This is an alert from a group that basically informs aircraft operators about relevant threats, relevant things to be aware of.
[03:33:35.143 --> 03:33:39.944]  It is called airalive.net or airlive.net.
[03:33:39.944 --> 03:33:47.667]  They've issued a rapid alert notification from Euro Control for Eastern Mediterranean Nicosia area stating that quote,
[03:33:48.843 --> 03:34:07.618]  Due to the possible launch of airstrikes into Syria with air-to-ground and or cruise missiles within the next 72 hours and the possibility of intermittent disruption of radio navigation equipment, due consideration needs to be taken when planning flight operations in the eastern Mediterranean Nicosia area.
[03:34:07.618 --> 03:34:10.440]  So that group is now warning aircraft operators
[03:34:11.218 --> 03:34:19.086]  That due to potential or possible likely airstrikes within the next 72 hours, they need to be careful about operating aircraft in that area.
[03:34:19.086 --> 03:34:21.848]  Again, this looks almost inevitable at this point.
[03:34:21.848 --> 03:34:25.532]  Looks like it may be delayed a couple of days or a few days.
[03:34:25.532 --> 03:34:32.058]  But this disastrous intervention looks like it's inevitable at this point, given all indications.
[03:34:32.058 --> 03:34:34.501]  Let's move on to some more news that are out of Europe here.
[03:34:35.805 --> 03:34:36.926]  This is out of Breitbart.
[03:34:36.926 --> 03:34:43.032]  EU's threat to Hungary after resounding election victory claims bloc will prevent dictatorships.
[03:34:43.032 --> 03:34:55.005]  We have the EU, specifically the EU Commission, an unelected body lecturing Hungary, which just had a democratic election, about them sliding into dictatorship.
[03:34:55.005 --> 03:34:57.087]  The EU already is a dictatorship!
[03:34:57.725 --> 03:34:59.026]  It's unelected.
[03:34:59.026 --> 03:35:01.647]  By its very nature, it's dictatorial.
[03:35:01.647 --> 03:35:03.608]  And they're lecturing Hungary.
[03:35:03.608 --> 03:35:05.188]  Doesn't get much richer than this.
[03:35:05.188 --> 03:35:07.829]  Doesn't get much more hypocritical than this.
[03:35:07.829 --> 03:35:19.054]  Comparing the newly re-elected government of Hungary to Cold War communist state, which is pretty bizarre because Viktor Orban, the leader of Hungary, there's pictures of him getting arrested by communist secret police.
[03:35:19.054 --> 03:35:20.215]  He fought against those people.
[03:35:21.244 --> 03:35:32.034]  EU Commission Vice President Franz Timmermans has made a thinly-veiled threat towards Viktor Orban's new government, warning Europe must not allow nations in the bloc to slide into dictatorship.
[03:35:32.034 --> 03:35:34.556]  Oh, the irony!
[03:35:34.556 --> 03:35:38.760]  I've seen Europe in its different forms, said Timmermans, speaking in Warsaw on Monday.
[03:35:38.760 --> 03:35:42.664]  Poland and Hungary, when the nations were still under communist dictatorship.
[03:35:42.664 --> 03:35:44.766]  He's an anti-communist, you fool!
[03:35:45.774 --> 03:35:47.961]  You're of an age that you've never seen that.
[03:35:47.961 --> 03:35:50.128]  The EU is closer to communism than Hungary.
[03:35:50.128 --> 03:35:52.134]  I mean, this just makes no sense whatsoever.
[03:35:53.231 --> 03:35:58.914]  He told journalists, we Europeans have a strong duty to make sure that you will never and that my children will never see it back again.
[03:35:58.914 --> 03:36:00.375]  Well, they already do see it.
[03:36:00.375 --> 03:36:04.797]  The EU is a dictatorial, classically communist in many ways, body.
[03:36:04.797 --> 03:36:06.438]  We already are seeing it.
[03:36:06.438 --> 03:36:12.361]  Europeans are rejecting it in droves, which is why they voted for Orban in massive numbers.
[03:36:12.361 --> 03:36:21.225]  Now he's got a majority where he can institute those constitutional reforms to basically purge George Soros of any influence within Hungary.
[03:36:22.069 --> 03:36:24.151]  And it's a bloody nose against the EU in general.
[03:36:24.151 --> 03:36:31.577]  So that's why they're absolutely apoplectic, raging at Hungary and Hungarians in general.
[03:36:31.577 --> 03:36:32.978]  Again, this was a fair election.
[03:36:32.978 --> 03:36:37.081]  Nobody's doubting the veracity, the neutrality of this election.
[03:36:37.081 --> 03:36:38.582]  It went off without a hitch.
[03:36:38.582 --> 03:36:43.947]  And yet he's now lecturing Orban about Hungary sliding towards a dictatorship.
[03:36:43.947 --> 03:36:45.788]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:36:45.788 --> 03:36:48.390]  And this is the same guy who in Timmermans, who in 2015
[03:36:49.957 --> 03:36:59.322]  He claimed the whole continent of Europe must become multicultural and that nations in Central Europe need leaders with the courage to explain this to their population.
[03:36:59.322 --> 03:37:03.303]  So he basically said we all need to capitulate to the mass migrant invasion in 2015.
[03:37:03.303 --> 03:37:17.730]  There's been a backlash against that, epitomized by people voting in droves for Viktor Orban, who put up a wall and successfully blocked that, who is refusing to take in more migrants, much to the chagrin of the EU.
[03:37:17.730 --> 03:37:18.791]  He's resisting that.
[03:37:19.412 --> 03:37:22.254]  And now this guy's calling him a dictator.
[03:37:22.254 --> 03:37:28.379]  When he's standing up for the interests of his own people who voted for him in giant numbers.
[03:37:28.379 --> 03:37:30.941]  Even more than people expected.
[03:37:30.941 --> 03:37:32.982]  Which relates us to this story.
[03:37:32.982 --> 03:37:33.783]  Related news.
[03:37:33.783 --> 03:37:39.527]  Soros defeated after attempting to rig Hungarian election and spending millions.
[03:37:39.527 --> 03:37:45.812]  George Soros has suffered a rather humiliating defeat after pumping millions of dollars into a Hungarian election he attempted to buy.
[03:37:46.903 --> 03:38:00.369]  Soros, who was born in Hungary, and desperately wanted hardened fascists to win the election, because he's the liberal European, is now out of millions of dollars, as Viktor Orban won with a whopping 70% of the vote.
[03:38:00.369 --> 03:38:15.195]  So again, with the votes counted, Europe elects his sharing stats, which show Fidesz, the party founded by Orban, while he was a young anti-communist dissident, as I explained, even though Hungary is now being compared to communist countries,
[03:38:16.022 --> 03:38:20.423]  It's led by a famous anti-communist dissident.
[03:38:20.423 --> 03:38:26.484]  Orban has won not merely a decisive majority, but an outright super-majority, along with minor allied parties.
[03:38:26.484 --> 03:38:34.626]  This will allow changes to the national constitution, and that's why they are absolutely enraged by this.
[03:38:34.626 --> 03:38:42.468]  Hopefully those changes will be for the better of the people, not the expansion of a liberty-trampling government, something Soros has championed for decades.
[03:38:43.157 --> 03:38:57.326]  The results will be extremely disappointing for top bureaucrats in the European Union and activists working for so-called civil society NGOs funded by billionaire open borders campaigner George Soros, who'd been hoping for an upset defeat.
[03:38:57.326 --> 03:38:58.967]  So they've got the supermajority.
[03:38:58.967 --> 03:39:01.228]  This is the one thing that Soros feared.
[03:39:01.228 --> 03:39:06.991]  If they'd have just won, not had that supermajority, his influence would have been maintained in the country.
[03:39:06.991 --> 03:39:09.613]  He could have got a bit of momentum.
[03:39:09.613 --> 03:39:11.134]  But now that's not going to happen.
[03:39:11.875 --> 03:39:18.658]  Soros is likely reeling from his discomfort that his globalist control over society is slipping, and quickly.
[03:39:18.658 --> 03:39:37.007]  So Orban, the anti-communist, is massively popular, the EU is hated, and yet now you have EU Commission unelected bureaucrats lecturing Orban, lecturing Hungarians that their country is a dictatorship, when it's simply a populist democracy, and they voted for him in huge numbers.
[03:39:38.181 --> 03:39:57.720]  Absolutely incredible situation huge split between East and West Europe where if you look at the polls in Eastern Europe you ask parents of children are they more confident for the future of their children in comparison to their own previous generations they say yeah we've got more confidence for future generations in huge numbers.
[03:39:57.720 --> 03:40:02.525]  Compare that to Western European countries France, Germany, Italy, UK for example
[03:40:03.280 --> 03:40:14.545]  They have less confidence in the future generations being successful, being happy, being prosperous, than they had in their own generation being happy, successful and prosperous.
[03:40:14.545 --> 03:40:23.928]  So there's a huge split between East and West, and it comes down to the fissure with this migrant invasion, which the Eastern European countries are rejecting.
[03:40:23.928 --> 03:40:30.531]  And on that very basis, on that platform, populist leaders like Orban are succeeding over and over again.
[03:40:31.556 --> 03:40:33.737]  Of course we have Sweden's election coming up.
[03:40:33.737 --> 03:40:38.978]  Italy just had their election again, another massive populist wave, populist victory.
[03:40:38.978 --> 03:40:48.781]  So the course of events is clear and that's why these globalists like Timmermans and Soros are freaking out, are getting more and more desperate.
[03:40:48.781 --> 03:40:55.603]  Headline out of Voice of Europe, Jihad expert stop accepting refugees, Europe is importing a civil war.
[03:40:55.603 --> 03:40:59.444]  Now this is a Palestinian-Belgian Jihad expert named Montaser Adam May.
[03:41:00.220 --> 03:41:02.781]  And he's either Muslim or ex-Muslim.
[03:41:02.781 --> 03:41:12.143]  He's issued a serious warning to Europe in a Dutch newspaper, De Telegraaf, in which he states, Europe is essentially importing a civil war by admitting refugees.
[03:41:12.143 --> 03:41:13.623]  And you've seen the scenes.
[03:41:13.623 --> 03:41:14.963]  You saw the scenes in Germany.
[03:41:14.963 --> 03:41:17.964]  I think it was a couple of weeks ago with the writing on the streets.
[03:41:17.964 --> 03:41:21.165]  Often it's inter-migrant battles now.
[03:41:21.165 --> 03:41:24.465]  It's not just, you know, regular German citizens being affected by this.
[03:41:24.465 --> 03:41:27.286]  They're actually having turf war battles between each other.
[03:41:28.470 --> 03:41:35.332]  So this Jihad expert believes Europe's politicians are naive when it comes to mass immigration, Islam and failed integration.
[03:41:35.332 --> 03:41:41.853]  He advises halting the influx of refugees, stating that Western Europe is, quote, importing a civil war.
[03:41:41.853 --> 03:41:43.454]  His words, not mine.
[03:41:43.454 --> 03:41:47.375]  Adding that we first have to know what we need to do with the people who are already here.
[03:41:47.375 --> 03:41:49.195]  Now again, it's come out of the UK today.
[03:41:49.195 --> 03:41:54.056]  Massive numbers of these so-called child refugees turned out to be adults.
[03:41:54.056 --> 03:41:55.677]  We had the same situation in Germany.
[03:41:55.677 --> 03:41:57.297]  We had the same situation in Sweden.
[03:41:58.183 --> 03:41:59.804]  And nobody seems to care about it.
[03:41:59.804 --> 03:42:08.051]  They're still letting them in, even though noted experts like this are saying that a civil war is in Europe's future.
[03:42:08.051 --> 03:42:12.655]  Meanwhile, Sweden's crime wave cities have left rural areas without police officers complain locals.
[03:42:13.709 --> 03:42:16.670]  They've got a situation in Malmo which is so bad.
[03:42:16.670 --> 03:42:22.612]  Explosions, grenade attacks, stabbings, shootings on a daily basis, cars being satellited.
[03:42:22.612 --> 03:42:31.896]  All the police are being drafted in from the surrounding areas to deal with this crime wave in the major cities in these heavily migrant populated cities in Sweden.
[03:42:32.416 --> 03:42:35.698]  And it's starting to cause massive problems, massive fallout.
[03:42:35.698 --> 03:42:38.719]  Sweden's election is coming up September 2018.
[03:42:38.719 --> 03:42:42.100]  Can the Sweden Democrats save Sweden?
[03:42:42.100 --> 03:42:48.443]  Basically it's come down to the wire in terms of the future of Sweden as a relatively free country in Europe.
[03:42:48.443 --> 03:42:50.084]  We'll be back with a final segment after break.
[03:42:50.084 --> 03:42:52.205]  It's the Alex Jones Show live in 4Wars.com.
[03:42:53.168 --> 03:42:56.911]  We need to fund this operation, ladies and gentlemen, and I make it really easy.
[03:42:56.911 --> 03:43:03.975]  We went out and looked at what the top nootropics, or brain pills, are that are healthy for energy, stamina, mental clarity, you name it.
[03:43:03.975 --> 03:43:08.739]  And we created a stronger formula than some of the best-selling formulas out there.
[03:43:08.739 --> 03:43:09.479]  It's very simple.
[03:43:09.479 --> 03:43:11.981]  We went out and looked at what is the top, what is the best.
[03:43:11.981 --> 03:43:13.922]  We'll just put even more product in, we'll make it better.
[03:43:13.922 --> 03:43:15.723]  Leading competitors put $2 a product in it, sell it for $60.
[03:43:15.723 --> 03:43:16.904]  We put $10 in it and sell it for $30.
[03:43:16.904 --> 03:43:17.645]  It's $19.95 right now.
[03:43:22.568 --> 03:43:25.790]  So you get an incredible top-of-the-line new Tropic for $19.95.
[03:43:25.790 --> 03:43:30.053]  Believe me, we're selling it for $35 on average.
[03:43:30.053 --> 03:43:33.896]  We need that $15, $20 we make to fund this operation in the face of the Globals, the rest of it.
[03:43:33.896 --> 03:43:37.778]  But I'm doing this because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks.
[03:43:37.778 --> 03:43:40.940]  I want to sell it all out before the big supply comes in.
[03:43:40.940 --> 03:43:44.583]  And I want people that haven't tried Brain Force to try it and find out why.

[03:49:39.825 --> 03:49:42.767]  This is an insurance policy and it helps support this network.
[03:49:43.675 --> 03:49:49.361]  Because we're constantly under assault from things like frivolous lawsuits.
[03:49:49.361 --> 03:49:53.725]  Which brings us to this headline which just went up on Infowars.com.
[03:49:53.725 --> 03:49:57.428]  Alex Jones files lawsuit against Georgetown University Law School.
[03:49:57.428 --> 03:50:04.876]  Of course, this was the subject of the big Washington Press Club press conference earlier today, which I'm sure most of you saw.
[03:50:04.876 --> 03:50:07.658]  Which is, by the way, up on the YouTube channel right now.
[03:50:07.658 --> 03:50:08.159]  If you didn't,
[03:50:09.128 --> 03:50:21.272]  Alex Jones and Infowars have launched an anti-slap motion against the defamation lawsuit filed by Twitter personality Brennan M. Gilmore and Georgetown University in addition to filing a motion to dismiss the suit entirely.
[03:50:21.272 --> 03:50:27.914]  Basically, because as Alex Jones has explained over and over again, it's completely frivolous, it's not even put together properly.
[03:50:28.630 --> 03:50:30.111]  And it's baseless.
[03:50:30.111 --> 03:50:54.719]  The 29-page motion filed by Jones's attorneys on Tuesday states that Gilmore failed to explain how statements made by Jones and independent journalist Lee Stranahan, who's been on the show of course, were in any way defamatory and that the suit itself fits the definition of a strategic lawsuit against public participation, SLAPP, which is illegal in many states because such lawsuits impede free speech by burdening defendants with legal fees.
[03:50:54.719 --> 03:50:56.520]  Now remember, even the Daily Beast
[03:50:57.459 --> 03:50:58.760]  Which completely hates us.
[03:50:58.760 --> 03:51:00.401]  It's hardly a far-right publication.
[03:51:00.401 --> 03:51:02.342]  It came out last week.
[03:51:02.342 --> 03:51:08.285]  Their legal expert said this would likely fall flat on its face because of those very reasons.
[03:51:08.285 --> 03:51:20.151]  Now, additionally, Jones's legal team pointed out that the lawsuit was filed in Virginia, a state which the defendants have no connection to whatsoever, and thus the court lacks personal jurisdiction over the free speech defendants.
[03:51:20.151 --> 03:51:22.072]  So they filed it in the wrong state.
[03:51:23.345 --> 03:51:33.075]  He goes on to say the circumstances of this suit demonstrate that it lacks any merit, was brought solely to harass and burden the defendants, and ultimately amounts to a publicity stunt.
[03:51:33.075 --> 03:51:35.798]  Again, this is to get media attention.
[03:51:35.798 --> 03:51:40.023]  Not a good faith legal action to address real claims of the plaintiff.
[03:51:40.023 --> 03:51:42.926]  The legal team also pointed out the lawsuit reads like a rant.
[03:51:43.852 --> 03:51:55.398]  A rant and rave editorial that gratuitously swipes at Jones and Infowars for pages over matters that had nothing to do with Gilmore, Georgetown or any of the alleged claims of the lawsuit.
[03:51:55.398 --> 03:51:57.459]  And again, that's what the Daily Beast said.
[03:51:57.459 --> 03:52:02.642]  Basically just goes on for pages and pages trying to impugn Infowars.com and our motivation.
[03:52:02.642 --> 03:52:05.724]  Even they said this is not going to look good in court.
[03:52:06.903 --> 03:52:17.190]  Continues, these statements represent nothing more than an attempt by Gilmore to provide a political message by invoking allegations that are immaterial to the statement of alleged claims.
[03:52:17.190 --> 03:52:23.915]  If Gilmore disagrees with Jones and in force, he has the right to express his grievances, but a court pleading is not the proper vehicle to do so.
[03:52:23.915 --> 03:52:26.037]  Again, we've seen the purge against Conservatives
[03:52:26.997 --> 03:52:29.078]  Since the election, this is part of it.
[03:52:29.078 --> 03:52:35.382]  Frivolous lawsuits instead of combating us on the field of debate, they try and be underhanded about it.
[03:52:35.382 --> 03:52:36.483]  Well, it's not going to work.
[03:52:36.483 --> 03:52:42.347]  We're actually standing up for ourselves at this point and saying enough is enough.
[03:52:42.347 --> 03:52:54.334]  The inclusion of these extraneous and irrelevant allegations underlines that the complaint is nothing more than a publicity vehicle for Gilmore and his advocacy, and we're calling him to the floor for that very reason.
[03:52:55.976 --> 03:53:02.781]  Furthermore, the lawsuit had no legal reason to name InfoWars reporter Leanne McAdoo as a defendant, the motion adds.
[03:53:02.781 --> 03:53:10.966]  Because, of course, she was merely conducting an interview with Stranahan, and yet they included her in the lawsuit anyway, which again proves it's completely arbitrary.
[03:53:12.518 --> 03:53:29.431]  It alleges no conduct on her part for which it seeks to impose liability and Gilmore could have no basis to assert actual malice, which of course is required, or any degree of culpability against a person who was merely interviewing someone else, Stranahan, who made the statement he challenges.
[03:53:29.431 --> 03:53:37.797]  Having baselessly dragged her into a lawsuit, Gilmore proceeds to gratuitously malign McAdoo by identifying her as a reporter in scare quotes.
[03:53:39.019 --> 03:53:40.460]  Ooh, scary reporter.
[03:53:40.460 --> 03:53:51.611]  You can read the full motion to dismiss and the background information on the lawsuit below, as well as watch Alex Jones's press conference over the lawsuit, which of course is up on the YouTube channel today.
[03:53:51.611 --> 03:53:54.073]  So we're standing up for ourselves.
[03:53:54.073 --> 03:53:56.756]  We're holding the First Amendment firm in our thoughts.
[03:53:56.756 --> 03:54:01.180]  We're backing up the right to free expression without threat of lawsuit.
[03:54:02.409 --> 03:54:07.232]  This is what we've seen over the past two, three months, and we saw it, of course, with YouTube as well.
[03:54:07.232 --> 03:54:10.314]  CNN lobbying to have our YouTube channel shut down.
[03:54:10.314 --> 03:54:21.381]  We've seen the Pepe the Frog creator try to file suit, even though he said, in his own words in a 2015 interview, to paraphrase, that anybody could make money off of his creation.
[03:54:23.081 --> 03:54:25.183]  And this is not the only lawsuit that we face.
[03:54:25.183 --> 03:54:27.085]  We've had others in the past that have been settled.
[03:54:27.085 --> 03:54:30.688]  Of course they get big media attention when they're made, when they're filed.
[03:54:30.688 --> 03:54:33.630]  Everybody celebrates, oh, InfoWars is being sued.
[03:54:33.630 --> 03:54:37.654]  They don't report when they collapse.
[03:54:37.654 --> 03:54:39.215]  Now this is up on InfoWars.com.
[03:54:39.215 --> 03:54:41.577]  You can read the full suit right there.
[03:54:41.577 --> 03:54:43.539]  It's embedded at the bottom of the page.
[03:54:43.539 --> 03:54:45.601]  Memorandum in support of motion to dismiss.
[03:54:47.262 --> 03:54:48.563]  It is available to read right now.
[03:54:48.563 --> 03:54:51.944]  We will not tolerate any more frivolous lawsuits.
[03:54:51.944 --> 03:54:54.305]  It's time to fight back.
[03:54:54.305 --> 03:54:58.607]  That is up on Infowars.com right now.
[03:54:58.607 --> 03:55:03.690]  Switching gears, Telegraph have six internships only open to non-white candidates.
[03:55:03.690 --> 03:55:05.831]  This is out of westmonster.com.
[03:55:05.831 --> 03:55:12.034]  Another media company is advertising roles only open to non-white candidates following a worrying trend.
[03:55:12.034 --> 03:55:16.236]  We've already seen this with the likes of BBC, ITV and the New States when they directly advertise
[03:55:17.316 --> 03:55:21.278]  Roles which specifically exclude white people.
[03:55:21.278 --> 03:55:34.985]  Now in the United Kingdom they did a poverty survey last year which found that white working class kids were basically at the bottom of the ladder when it came to opportunity, when it came to educational and career achievements.
[03:55:35.720 --> 03:55:38.883]  The top of the ladder is Indians because they own a lot of businesses.
[03:55:38.883 --> 03:55:40.525]  They're doing very well for themselves.
[03:55:40.525 --> 03:55:42.467]  The bottom is white working class people.
[03:55:42.467 --> 03:55:50.315]  So why do we have job candidacies that discriminate against white people by barring them from application?
[03:55:50.315 --> 03:55:55.380]  And these roles aren't even related to any kind of what they call BAME profession.
[03:55:55.976 --> 03:55:58.979]  You know, an ethnic minority kind of profession.
[03:55:58.979 --> 03:56:00.039]  Nothing to do with it.
[03:56:00.039 --> 03:56:10.208]  The roles are for editorial internships, including the Telegraph sports desk, news team, personal finance team, and video team.
[03:56:10.208 --> 03:56:16.833]  So if this was to do with some kind of black culture position within an organization, maybe you can understand why they would want a black person.
[03:56:16.833 --> 03:56:18.274]  Okay, fair enough.
[03:56:18.274 --> 03:56:22.337]  But this is for sports, personal finance, and news.
[03:56:22.337 --> 03:56:22.798]  This is just
[03:56:23.510 --> 03:56:25.053]  Flagrant discrimination.
[03:56:25.053 --> 03:56:26.495]  This is against the law.
[03:56:26.495 --> 03:56:33.646]  The paid internships all state the traineeship is only open to candidates from black, Asian or non-white ethnic minority background.
[03:56:33.646 --> 03:56:37.432]  So again, if you're white, don't bother to apply.
[03:56:37.432 --> 03:56:38.614]  This isn't equality.
[03:56:39.278 --> 03:56:42.859]  Stopping people from applying for a role because they happen to be white is disgusting.
[03:56:42.859 --> 03:56:52.923]  That means those who happen to be privately educated and from a different ethnic background now have more opportunities to get into media than a poor white kid from a council estate.
[03:56:52.923 --> 03:56:55.424]  How does that make any sense whatsoever?
[03:56:55.424 --> 03:57:04.407]  They say oh you can't be racist against white people even though we have dominant cultural institutions discriminating against white people making it cool for the last
[03:57:05.171 --> 03:57:08.293]  Acceptable form of racism to be against white people.
[03:57:08.293 --> 03:57:17.958]  And now we have this actual big media firm saying to people, if you're white, if you're a poor white kid from a council estate who's just trying to get ahead in life, forget it.
[03:57:17.958 --> 03:57:19.079]  You're not welcome.
[03:57:19.079 --> 03:57:23.221]  Because we've got these stupid diversity quotas that we need to meet.
[03:57:23.221 --> 03:57:28.384]  How about just have the best people apply for the job, regardless of their skin color?
[03:57:28.384 --> 03:57:30.005]  How about not being racist?
[03:57:30.005 --> 03:57:31.606]  How about that for a change?
[03:57:32.327 --> 03:57:34.272]  That's going to wrap it up for the Alex Jones Show.
[03:57:34.272 --> 03:57:37.198]  Coming up next, War Room with Owen Schroyer.

[03:58:53.182 --> 03:58:54.363]  It's stronger.
[03:58:54.363 --> 03:58:55.984]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[03:58:55.984 --> 03:58:59.207]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
