[00:00.000 --> 00:05.480]  This is an emergency transmission from deep in the heart of Texas, the U.S. resistance
[00:05.480 --> 00:10.160]  against a global corporate combine empowered and funded by Communist China, allied with
[00:10.160 --> 00:13.800]  the big megabanks that set up Communist China in 1949.
[00:13.800 --> 00:18.120]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of U.S. telecommunications infrastructure.
[00:18.120 --> 00:20.280]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of Hollywood.
[00:20.280 --> 00:22.680]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of the main universities.
[00:22.680 --> 00:23.680]  This is all confirmed.
[00:23.680 --> 00:24.880]  This is not a drill.
[00:24.880 --> 00:28.760]  Big Tech and Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the Communist Chinese government.
[00:28.760 --> 00:30.480]  They've officially become state-run.
[00:30.480 --> 00:36.480]  Apple 100% Google is now making the transition and announcing a merger in total worldwide
[00:36.480 --> 00:37.480]  censorship.
[00:37.480 --> 00:41.840]  They are now beta testing using me as the straw man, a demonized version of Alex Jones
[00:41.840 --> 00:42.840]  to do that.
[00:42.840 --> 00:43.840]  This is happening.
[00:43.840 --> 00:48.040]  This is not like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship,
[00:48.040 --> 00:51.600]  thinking you would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it.
[00:51.600 --> 00:56.600]  Now this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude of all
[00:56.600 --> 00:57.600]  previous attacks.
[00:57.600 --> 01:03.760]  This is a tight-traded dose, reverse psychological warfare operation using adapt and overcome,
[01:03.760 --> 01:05.760]  subversion, paradigm manipulation.
[01:05.760 --> 01:10.560]  In layman's terms, they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed.
[01:10.560 --> 01:14.080]  We adapt to being pressed with the low dosages of oppression.
[01:14.080 --> 01:19.920]  Now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover, we try to adapt to the poison infusion
[01:19.920 --> 01:24.600]  instead of not knowing it's a lethal dose if we accept the dose.
[01:24.600 --> 01:34.880]  It is the virtual reality AI weapon system now attacking the United States with traders
[01:34.880 --> 01:39.640]  inside the major security agencies, blocking Trump's resistance of the program and attempting
[01:39.640 --> 01:44.240]  to stop us from removing the tentacles of the chai-con slash big tech-making combined
[01:44.240 --> 01:45.240]  emergency situation.
[01:45.240 --> 01:49.000]  I have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information and have been
[01:49.000 --> 01:51.880]  battering, ramming it out as much as I can.
[01:51.880 --> 01:57.080]  They want to double-use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception
[01:57.080 --> 02:00.640]  where every angle of my good is turned against us.
[02:00.640 --> 02:05.160]  So they take what I've said, being sincere, build me into an insincere person in the straw
[02:05.160 --> 02:09.600]  man, a person that cares about life and children and is against these wars and so they make
[02:09.600 --> 02:14.640]  me a herder of children and then they build me into this lie to then set the distraction
[02:14.640 --> 02:18.560]  while they're actually censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones.
[02:18.560 --> 02:24.440]  So even if I didn't sell out to them, they've now used me as an archetype to serve them
[02:24.440 --> 02:26.320]  by being the main distraction.
[02:26.320 --> 02:30.960]  I have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum and it's being
[02:30.960 --> 02:31.960]  used against you.
[02:31.960 --> 02:36.960]  Only your full understanding of this key will break you free from this paradigm.
[02:36.960 --> 02:43.520]  I have given you the transmission, now break free!
[02:43.520 --> 03:06.880]  I am here because there is a concerted effort by the Democratic Party and multinational corporations
[03:06.880 --> 03:12.440]  in Big Tech to silence conservative and nationalist and populist voices ahead of this critical
[03:12.440 --> 03:14.120]  midterm election.
[03:14.120 --> 03:19.120]  And the Big Tech companies and the head of Apple admit that they met with Senator Warner
[03:19.120 --> 03:23.840]  who's running this whole thing to begin shutting down conservatives or the Democrats threatened
[03:23.840 --> 03:27.680]  to federalize Big Tech if they did not basically roll over to them.
[03:27.680 --> 03:31.800]  So the Republicans left a vacuum there by not coming in with regulations to say you
[03:31.800 --> 03:34.480]  cannot violate people's free speech.
[03:34.480 --> 03:39.400]  Mr. Jones, this morning's hearing is specifically about preventing election manipulation.
[03:39.400 --> 03:40.400]  This afternoon's hearing is-
[03:40.400 --> 03:45.240]  Yeah, but every time they have these meetings they bring up info wars, they claim they're
[03:45.240 --> 03:47.840]  taking info wars down to stop election meddling.
[03:47.840 --> 03:53.400]  Obama established with an executive order a special office that deals with foreign propaganda.
[03:53.400 --> 03:58.360]  What it's really been used is to target domestic populist popular groups.
[03:58.360 --> 04:01.920]  The real election meddling is by Facebook and Google and others that are shadow banning
[04:01.920 --> 04:05.960]  people, that are outright banning people and that are blocking conservatives involved
[04:05.960 --> 04:08.040]  in their own first amendment political speech.
[04:08.040 --> 04:12.160]  Even the New York Times calls it a crackdown on conservatives and a plan to de-platform
[04:12.160 --> 04:15.840]  conservatives from the internet and communicating with each other.
[04:15.840 --> 04:21.200]  Just like Communist China, this is dangerous authoritarianism and they packaged silencing
[04:21.200 --> 04:26.160]  Americans who are popular and well-spoken as Tucker Carlson said about me on Fox News.
[04:26.160 --> 04:30.520]  Not because what I say is bad, but because what I say is effective and true and popular.
[04:30.520 --> 04:35.080]  But I think the corporate dying dinosaur media has been off more than it could chew and what
[04:35.080 --> 04:38.600]  you've done is only going to make people be that much stronger and fight for free speech
[04:38.600 --> 04:39.600]  that much more.
[04:39.600 --> 04:44.680]  But I'll say this, shame on the mainstream corporate media, shame on the mainstream corporate
[04:44.680 --> 04:49.240]  media for not defending the first amendment, but instead a tap dogging calling for federal
[04:49.240 --> 05:00.480]  regulators to shut down independent free press working with big tech.
[05:00.480 --> 05:05.520]  And now, through the end of March, we are running the biggest special of this year.
[05:05.520 --> 05:09.760]  So far, it matches any other special we've ever done, so this is the best deal we've
[05:09.760 --> 05:11.160]  ever offered.
[05:11.160 --> 05:16.840]  Free shipping store-wide, that's free shipping store-wide, free shipping store-wide, 50% off
[05:16.840 --> 05:21.360]  all the supplements, a bunch of other great deals as well, double-patriot points instead
[05:21.360 --> 05:26.960]  of 5% on each order, towards your next order, you get 10% right during your profile, sign
[05:26.960 --> 05:32.160]  up for auto-ship, cancel any time for free, get an additional 10% off on your next order,
[05:32.160 --> 05:34.240]  that's 20% off.
[05:34.240 --> 05:39.560]  You add that to 50% off and store-wide free shipping, most of these products are lost
[05:39.560 --> 05:40.560]  leaders.
[05:40.560 --> 05:43.400]  So I want to thank you all for supporting the InfoWare and I want to encourage you today
[05:43.400 --> 05:47.360]  to get great products in the 361 InfoWareStore.com.

[06:57.280 --> 07:02.640]  Well to be honest, my head is spinning right now, there's so much incredible news, so much
[07:02.640 --> 07:10.360]  incredible information, so many amazing statements by Democrats with their total disconnect from
[07:10.360 --> 07:16.760]  reality, their haughtiness, their entitleness, and then you look at what the European Union
[07:16.760 --> 07:22.280]  is doing, it's the exact same behavior it is, corrupt establishment minions and the
[07:22.280 --> 07:27.280]  elites that control them believing they can get away with anything and everything and
[07:27.280 --> 07:34.280]  as the world turns against them, they are lurching forward trying to control information.
[07:36.240 --> 07:43.240]  I spent most of the broadcast yesterday talking about the draconian censorship and how the
[07:43.920 --> 07:49.400]  dam has broken, and how it is now leading to financial control, not allowing people
[07:49.400 --> 07:56.400]  to travel, basically a mark of the beast type totalitarianism, a pandora's box, but I'm
[07:58.880 --> 08:05.880]  briefly later in the shower going to get into the manifestation of the censorship and
[08:06.320 --> 08:12.480]  how it's going to be happening live time on your phone, on your television, with overlays
[08:12.480 --> 08:19.000]  on your device, popping in telling you don't believe this, don't do that, don't go here,
[08:19.000 --> 08:23.560]  don't do that, which is really them getting you used to being surveilled for what you
[08:23.560 --> 08:30.400]  watch and read, these people are just flagrantly corrupt, but you got to hand it to them, they're
[08:30.400 --> 08:37.400]  rushing so far trillions of light years down the black hole of tyranny that by the time
[08:40.320 --> 08:47.320]  we even wake up to what's happening, we've already arrived in hell, and that's really
[08:47.320 --> 08:54.320]  what all this is. News guard is already in the Microsoft devices, it's coming out on
[08:55.000 --> 09:02.000]  droid devices and Apple devices by the end of the year, where it imposes propaganda at
[09:03.520 --> 09:10.520]  the browser level on your phone, on your computer, on your TV, and now I've got it in the news
[09:10.520 --> 09:17.520]  here, what's app launches fact checking service to fight fake news? Reuters, Pope warns against
[09:19.800 --> 09:26.800]  hate fomenting fake news, and we've seen Senator Murphy and Senator Blumenthal and others this
[09:26.880 --> 09:33.880]  week come out again and say we must ban Alex Jones and other people like him to save America's
[09:33.880 --> 09:40.880]  democracy. Yes, silence people to save their freedom, and there's a big article out, the
[09:41.880 --> 09:48.880]  BBC is reporting it, Tommy Robinson, due to request by the British government, has been
[09:52.000 --> 09:56.640]  banned from live streaming on YouTube, and his videos have been shadow banned, so you
[09:56.640 --> 10:02.280]  have to hand share them so that other people can't see them. The article's on info wars
[10:02.280 --> 10:07.080]  dot com. British members of parliament force YouTube to ban Tommy Robinson from streaming
[10:07.080 --> 10:14.080]  live. Hey, how about this? If the lawyers for the Sandy Hook families that are religious
[10:17.000 --> 10:22.720]  Democrat operatives, as the lawyers using the poor families to always keep Sandy Hook
[10:22.720 --> 10:29.720]  in the news, in my name, leaked the transcript and leaked the deposition I did a few weeks
[10:29.720 --> 10:35.640]  ago, and I've talked to lawyers and stuff, that violates the court rules, violates basically
[10:35.640 --> 10:41.200]  the law, they just don't care. And I'm not going to get into our counteraction against
[10:41.200 --> 10:46.160]  that, but the point is is that they just do whatever they want, whenever they want, and
[10:46.160 --> 10:53.160]  then lie about what I said or spin it. But they're allowed to put up three hours of footage
[10:53.160 --> 11:00.160]  on YouTube that the court told them not to do. But then I had Joe Rogan in studio a week
[11:06.320 --> 11:13.320]  and a half ago, and the video got two million views on just some MMA channel called Gangster
[11:16.240 --> 11:22.160]  MMA, who'd posted old interviews with Eddie Bravo and Joe Rogan on the show. The guys
[11:22.160 --> 11:29.160]  had an account since 2014, and it's an MMA channel. And when I have MMA people on mixed
[11:31.920 --> 11:38.920]  martial arts, he posted, the guys try to go to YouTube and pull it up. It had two million
[11:40.440 --> 11:44.840]  views in just a few days. That means it was going to keep going to like 20 million views.
[11:44.840 --> 11:49.920]  The Joe Rogan interview was taken down and the message that popped up on my phone from
[11:49.920 --> 11:56.920]  the link I sent Joe was you violated community guidelines. So this was a nice, friendly interview
[11:59.000 --> 12:06.000]  for an hour and a half, covering suicide crisis in America, covering censorship, really a
[12:06.400 --> 12:13.400]  smooth, nice, friendly interview that you'd expect to hear even on mainstream interviews.
[12:13.400 --> 12:20.400]  Everybody knows my stuff's free to air, posting where you want. Took it down, two million views.
[12:21.440 --> 12:25.600]  We had a fan channel put it up, got a hundred thousand views in a couple hours, pulled it
[12:25.600 --> 12:32.600]  down. So people are allowed to put court order violating sealed deposition on the internet
[12:32.600 --> 12:37.600]  and do whatever they want. And it's there. And they can edit it however they want to,
[12:37.600 --> 12:41.600]  as the media did. There are going to be thousands of clips up there, and they can all monetize
[12:41.600 --> 12:48.600]  it, make money off of it. But I can't have a video on the platform in a polite, nice way
[12:50.440 --> 12:57.440]  defending myself. If that is a discrimination, if that isn't fraud, if that isn't tilted
[12:57.440 --> 13:04.440]  playing field, nothing is. And so this is the future for everybody. And that's where
[13:05.400 --> 13:12.400]  this is going. Maxine Waters came out, we've got the video, and said Smollett has been
[13:12.840 --> 13:17.840]  quote cleared, and that Smollett is great and like her son, and that she's so proud of him
[13:17.840 --> 13:24.320]  and he did a good job. I told you, I told you, I told you, I told you, I told you, I
[13:24.320 --> 13:31.320]  did a good job. I told you, they're proud of him. They stage stuff themselves. These
[13:32.320 --> 13:39.320]  are crooks. These are bad people. These are crazy people. You talk about cringe worthy.
[13:41.880 --> 13:47.480]  I may play Smollett's music video that he did last year about racism where somebody
[13:47.480 --> 13:53.360]  puts a noose around his neck again, and how he feels sorry for himself and how he tries
[13:53.360 --> 13:57.800]  to get minorities to be a bunch of racist. I mean, it's just next level cuckoo land.
[13:57.800 --> 14:02.920]  It's like creepy Joe Biden that's always rubbing his hands on women's breast and butts and
[14:02.920 --> 14:06.480]  everything, and then the Democrats defend and say, oh, he's just being friendly. If there
[14:06.480 --> 14:13.320]  was any footage of that with Kavanaugh, he'd be probably executed. It's all hypocrisy.
[14:13.320 --> 14:16.600]  It's the essence of corruption. We're going to go to break and come back, and I'm not
[14:16.600 --> 14:20.560]  going to talk about that anymore. And I'm going to get into the fact that globalists
[14:20.560 --> 14:24.320]  are openly trying to collapse this country, and we're on the knife's edge of prosperity
[14:24.320 --> 14:28.040]  or destruction. And I mean it when I say it, and the border patrol agrees, stay with us
[14:28.040 --> 14:31.440]  for that.
[14:31.440 --> 14:38.440]  DNA Force Plus is a product that is unparalleled in its quality with the PQQ, the CoQ10, the
[14:39.720 --> 14:46.720]  other patented cofactors where you can actually say slows the slowing of the telomeres. It
[14:46.720 --> 14:53.720]  means the telomeres in the DNA don't shorten as fast, and that's the same thing as saying
[14:55.720 --> 15:02.720]  about in the youth. And it does so many other things, and we've been able to make bigger
[15:03.040 --> 15:10.040]  deals by ordering even more to lower the price from $150 retail down to $100. Leading competitors
[15:11.560 --> 15:16.160]  that sell similar formulas that have the true organic forms of this that are very expensive
[15:16.160 --> 15:22.320]  for doing thousands of dollars a kilo, sell it for $300, $400 usually through medical clinics.
[15:22.320 --> 15:27.720]  We have the formula, it's a good deal at $100. We have it right now, ladies and gentlemen,
[15:27.720 --> 15:34.720]  for $59.80. Little bottles of PQQ and CoQ10 that are synthetic are $50 a piece, and they
[15:36.160 --> 15:41.200]  don't even have one-tenth of what this has in it. It's incredible. DNA Force, we've never
[15:41.200 --> 15:48.200]  had a deal this good, and it's available at infowarsstore.com, but at this price only
[15:48.480 --> 15:55.480]  for a limited time, maybe a week or so. 60% off, organic reishi, astragalus, and even
[15:56.040 --> 15:58.640]  more incredible ingredients with the PQQ CoQ10.
[15:58.640 --> 16:05.640]  Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon you'll need a plan and place to survive.

[16:34.200 --> 16:39.460]  levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there. Loss of energy, blood
[16:39.460 --> 16:44.160]  sugar, spikes, and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of
[16:44.160 --> 16:48.640]  these that can alert you that something is wrong. Here, how heart and body extract is

[17:23.480 --> 17:31.040]  866-295-5305, or hbextract.com. The United States of Empire is a book that
[17:31.040 --> 17:36.320]  claims the United States is the empire of the world. George Washington had warned us
[17:36.320 --> 17:42.560]  against foreign wars. The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left
[17:42.560 --> 17:48.960]  England broken. Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire. Was there ever a vote?
[17:48.960 --> 17:55.080]  Who do we fight for? The deep state began with World War I, the United States of Empire,
[17:55.080 --> 18:05.480]  by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books. One of the most incredible cups of coffee

[20:21.640 --> 20:28.640]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening
[20:28.640 --> 20:31.640]  to Alex Jones.
[20:38.640 --> 20:43.120]  It's already April 2nd, 2019 on your host Alex Jones. We're going to be here for another
[20:43.120 --> 20:47.200]  three hours and 40 minutes. I intend to open the phones up at the end of the hour and have
[20:47.200 --> 20:52.240]  open phones throughout the broadcast today. Paul Joseph Watson will join us in the fourth
[20:52.240 --> 21:01.960]  hour, but guess free until the fourth hour to be clear to be specific. Okay. I want to
[21:01.960 --> 21:12.040]  be very specific and very direct about this. I do not take pleasure in the ignorance and
[21:12.040 --> 21:19.240]  the stupidity of the public. It scares the hell out of me. But if you listen to Democrats
[21:19.240 --> 21:27.640]  on the record and off the record, whether it's Nancy Pelosi or Jonathan Gruber or any
[21:27.640 --> 21:32.880]  of these people, they count on the general public being dumb and they love it and they
[21:32.880 --> 21:41.920]  have to stain. It's like Zuckerberg saying, our users trust us. What a bunch of dumb efforts.
[21:41.920 --> 21:51.120]  The former director, Mr. Parker under Zuckerberg in his first few years when he helped launch
[21:51.120 --> 21:55.920]  it. When public last year and he said, we designed it to make everybody depressed, to
[21:55.920 --> 22:03.840]  isolate people and then to be able to control them with bots who aren't even real people.
[22:03.840 --> 22:13.080]  We designed it to radicalize and he said, and now it's even more dangerous. So think
[22:13.080 --> 22:23.960]  about that. And that's what the whole thing does. Designed to target vulnerabilities.
[22:23.960 --> 22:32.760]  I'm designed to try to boost your capabilities. Optimum self sufficiency is my goal. I believe
[22:32.760 --> 22:38.680]  in rugged individualism. Doesn't mean I live by it 100%. But I know what's right. When
[22:38.680 --> 22:47.200]  you aren't strong, I feel weak. When you're not informed, I feel stupid. And these sociopaths,
[22:47.200 --> 22:51.640]  they think people like me are weak because I haven't joined them. But because we've been
[22:51.640 --> 22:57.000]  beating them, the humanity's spirit of wanting to survive has been coming back. Our life
[22:57.000 --> 23:04.920]  force has begun to glow again. They sensed to silence me. I don't want you to let them
[23:04.920 --> 23:11.960]  do that. And that starts with them not being able to silence you because they hate your
[23:11.960 --> 23:18.640]  guts. So stop acting like you're the stupid jellyfish they say you are because you aren't.
[23:18.640 --> 23:22.720]  This planet is not going to make it if we don't stand up and take action. Now I'm going
[23:22.720 --> 23:31.360]  to get to the specifics of what I'm talking about next segment. This arrogance, the insanity
[23:31.360 --> 23:36.240]  because it's not just the general public that's been dumbed down. It's the so-called establishments
[23:36.240 --> 23:40.000]  who are disconnected like Marie Antoinette. They're going to storm the Bastille or by
[23:40.000 --> 23:43.640]  starving to death. And she reportedly said, no one knows if it's true. But the point is
[23:43.640 --> 23:54.080]  it, it mirrored their decadence that was real. Oh, the city is starving. Let them eat cake.
[23:54.080 --> 24:01.160]  Anybody who's ever been around rich, decadent people who are multi-generational will know
[24:01.160 --> 24:07.280]  that they're what my friend calls aliens and not aliens from another planet. People that
[24:07.280 --> 24:12.440]  are third, fourth, fifth generation rich just aren't like everybody else because they're
[24:12.440 --> 24:20.640]  disconnected from reality and they don't know what it takes to do anything. And they have
[24:20.640 --> 24:27.040]  a let them eat cake attitude. Now that's the better ones. Those that actually seek power
[24:27.040 --> 24:33.560]  out of those sociopathic pools are nasty and they become even more delusional and entitled
[24:33.560 --> 24:42.920]  than what they're doing. And they all get hyped up by each other's weird narcissism.
[24:42.920 --> 24:50.760]  So we're going to be breaking it down. But the title of the live feed today that's going
[24:50.760 --> 24:55.560]  out at infowars.com and newswars.com and out on satellite to our TV and radio stations
[24:55.560 --> 25:07.800]  is Red Alert. America is on the verge of economic and cultural collapse and Trump is fighting
[25:07.800 --> 25:16.640]  to stop it. And everything Trump does is 101, stabilize the nation, stop the demoralization,
[25:16.640 --> 25:30.080]  justify the people around shared values and really empower the people. Trump's tax cuts
[25:30.080 --> 25:34.800]  were only to poor people and lower middle class. He raised taxes on the middle class
[25:34.800 --> 25:42.200]  and rich people and raised taxes on corporations and raised taxes on the Democrats that have
[25:42.200 --> 25:47.800]  a tax avoidance scheme in all the states to not pay income tax and write it off into property
[25:47.800 --> 25:55.160]  tax as a scam. And that saves the value in the home. Trump blew all that up. That's
[25:55.160 --> 26:00.400]  why they hate him. He's more like JFK with his policies. He's more like a old fashioned
[26:00.400 --> 26:05.480]  Democrat from a hundred years ago with some of the attributes they had, at least on paper
[26:05.480 --> 26:10.080]  about empowering the average person. So a lot of wealthy people are like, my God, my
[26:10.080 --> 26:15.960]  taxes went up. Yeah. That's because Trump needs the funding to stabilize the country
[26:15.960 --> 26:21.160]  and rebuild the military because the military we have now is just for fighting Islamists
[26:21.160 --> 26:25.200]  and getting troops killed instead of dealing with the Chai comms and other people that
[26:25.200 --> 26:30.480]  we have to have total space superiority. We have to have missile superiority. We have
[26:30.480 --> 26:36.040]  to have aircraft superiority. We have to have the avionics and command and control systems
[26:36.040 --> 26:40.200]  that are separate from the current systems we have that the Chinese have infiltrated.
[26:40.200 --> 26:48.080]  This country is in deep crap. And I don't say that with pleasure. Like America was never
[26:48.080 --> 26:51.480]  great. I'll never be that great. No, it's been great. It's going to be great again,
[26:51.480 --> 26:56.000]  but we're in a lot of trouble. Okay. In fact, when we come back, I'll get to the borders
[26:56.000 --> 27:01.840]  and the rest of it. And I know you know all this, but it's coming to a head. I don't want
[27:01.840 --> 27:08.760]  to be gross, but women that are out of their skin will tell you never pop a zit. You see
[27:08.760 --> 27:12.120]  women that will just let it build and build and build till one day it just kind of comes
[27:12.120 --> 27:18.200]  out of them. And this thing's already popped. It's already using down the side of our face
[27:18.200 --> 27:23.840]  and it's turning into a big festering wound that's going to kill us literally and figuratively.
[27:23.840 --> 27:28.360]  There are hundreds of thousands of people a day trying to get in at the three largest
[27:28.360 --> 27:36.040]  border checkpoints. They've all gone about 15,000 a day hitting three times 15 folks.
[27:36.040 --> 27:45.200]  You know what that is, right? That's 45,000 people hitting three of the biggest border
[27:45.200 --> 27:59.960]  crossings. 45,000, 15,000 in McAllen, 15,000 in El Paso, more than 15,000 trying to come
[27:59.960 --> 28:06.400]  across in a San Diego. Can you imagine what that's like for the police? And then the argument
[28:06.400 --> 28:11.440]  about veto on the Democrats is just open it, just open it, just open it completely for
[28:11.440 --> 28:18.080]  tens of millions to pour in. This is the total collapse. The country is at war. We are under
[28:18.080 --> 28:26.240]  attack. The UN and the Democrats orchestrated this on record. Trump is desperately trying
[28:26.240 --> 28:34.360]  to fight it. But the courts and much of the Congress and much of the people are soft and
[28:34.360 --> 28:41.840]  stupid. And Trump will be fine. You know, he'll just be behind armored gates or move to other
[28:41.840 --> 28:46.400]  countries. What about the average American? But what color you are? We're becoming the
[28:46.400 --> 28:52.160]  third world. And it's going to be managed by the Democrats and others to socially bring
[28:52.160 --> 28:57.200]  the country into something akin to Venezuela. Now, if that isn't collapsed, I don't know
[28:57.200 --> 28:59.560]  what it is.

[33:35.200 --> 33:42.440]  I was there Saturday night at a Hitlerian nighttime rally at 1030 as it
[33:42.440 --> 33:52.120]  shut down Congress Avenue as he stood like a supposed buck-toothed God with
[33:52.120 --> 33:58.080]  the Texas Capitol behind him, he that would turn Texas into Mexico, he who
[33:58.080 --> 34:02.920]  would hand Texas back to Mexico, he who says there shouldn't even be a border
[34:02.920 --> 34:13.840]  and that America sucks, Beto O'Rourke and then he got up on the stage and said, I
[34:13.840 --> 34:18.960]  had the video, that we here are the Earth's only hope and that's the narrative
[34:18.960 --> 34:24.320]  from AOC and Beto and the rest of them, is the Earth's gonna end in 12 years
[34:24.320 --> 34:30.360]  unless you give them full power. That sounds like the hail bop, the Jim Jones,
[34:30.360 --> 34:36.320]  you name it, cults all rolled into one and there's another publication, The
[34:36.320 --> 34:42.800]  Weeks Even Come Out with Bonnie Christen and says, don't idolize your 2020 pick
[34:42.800 --> 34:47.200]  and she's got photos from the Austin rally with people saying Beto is our
[34:47.200 --> 34:55.680]  Jesus Christ. Beto is our Jesus Christ, it's in the article, don't idolize your
[34:55.680 --> 35:01.320]  2020 pick, you just scroll down, you can see it. Beto is our Christ, there it is,
[35:01.320 --> 35:12.120]  that person is crying. We're talking up to 3,000 drooling morons and I came up
[35:12.120 --> 35:17.320]  into the crowd about 10 yards behind where that man's standing and the media
[35:17.320 --> 35:22.560]  pointed at me like the movie Body Snatchers and said, it's him, it's Alex
[35:22.560 --> 35:28.000]  Jones, get him. Even though I had security with me, they began trying to
[35:28.000 --> 35:33.360]  attack me, so police came and escorted us out of the mob and I bullhorned him
[35:33.360 --> 35:40.920]  from about 70 yards away. Think about that and it was very successful but
[35:40.920 --> 35:48.880]  that's who they are, that's what they stand for. They hate free speech, they
[35:48.880 --> 35:54.560]  hate diversity, they hate tolerance, they believe they rule this country and the
[35:54.560 --> 36:04.440]  world and they were messianically looking at Beto like he was God. A person
[36:04.440 --> 36:08.920]  who, when you watch him and listen to him speak, you can tell is completely
[36:08.920 --> 36:15.000]  insane but his insane wavelength goes out to them, everything's gonna be free,
[36:15.000 --> 36:21.000]  all your college, you won't have to work just like AOC said in a Green Deal.
[36:21.000 --> 36:26.520]  Healthcare is gonna be free, everything is gonna be free and these people, when
[36:26.520 --> 36:32.720]  you sit there and you talk to them, they're gone. I'm like, what about Beto
[36:32.720 --> 36:37.680]  saying he supports killing babies after they're born? Yeah, kill the babies! Woo!
[36:37.680 --> 36:42.800]  The crowd's like, yeah, kill babies! They're all a bunch of unemployed, spoiled
[36:42.800 --> 36:48.320]  brats or their professors or their teacher's aides and they believe they
[36:48.320 --> 36:52.560]  rule this nation, they believe your children belong to them. They're all
[36:52.560 --> 37:00.640]  soft, they're all stupid, they're all dangerous, they're all authoritarian and
[37:00.880 --> 37:07.920]  they are not Americans and I want to explain this and I've said this but
[37:07.920 --> 37:11.080]  this is the most fundamental thing I'll ever say and I hope everybody gets it
[37:11.080 --> 37:16.960]  to their heads because I used to even hear people like Neil Boards before he
[37:16.960 --> 37:22.800]  retired going, Democrats hate America, their religion is hating America and I'm
[37:22.800 --> 37:25.480]  like no they just want full control of them and why would you want to hate
[37:25.480 --> 37:30.440]  something that's so big and wealthy and powerful they just want control but over
[37:30.440 --> 37:34.320]  the years I learned that yeah not just the universities, I knew there were
[37:34.320 --> 37:39.320]  people that hated the country, the universities and things because they
[37:39.320 --> 37:44.280]  were globalist, they want to conquer it but in the last few years going out to
[37:44.280 --> 37:49.400]  Hillary rallies and Obama rallies and other rallies just to cover them you can
[37:49.400 --> 37:52.080]  be as polite as pie, they're hateful and mean, tell you to get out of there,
[37:52.080 --> 37:56.800]  leave me on the street corner, they all attack you and I would just say hey
[37:56.800 --> 38:01.520]  Trump's ideas of bringing factories back and helping Americans is good, it's okay
[38:01.520 --> 38:06.760]  to love your country and I learned that's the thing that sends them into
[38:06.760 --> 38:11.880]  violent spazzing or they'll look down and just get really depressed and start
[38:11.880 --> 38:20.040]  crying and it happens everywhere I go now I say America's coming back you're
[38:20.040 --> 38:25.760]  not going to stop it and it's like pulling the son out of a bag in the
[38:25.760 --> 38:31.840]  dark of the night in front of a bunch of vampires they freak out these are
[38:31.840 --> 38:37.440]  crazy people and that's why you keep asking I keep asking why would the
[38:37.440 --> 38:41.960]  governor of New York or why would Joe Biden or why would all these people go
[38:41.960 --> 38:47.740]  to speeches now and say white people are inherently evil and America's horrible
[38:47.740 --> 38:56.360]  and will never be great and isn't great and it's because they want open borders
[38:56.360 --> 39:00.560]  world government they are the mercenary servants of the globalists and so
[39:00.560 --> 39:04.360]  America is the enemy and I know you already know that but I want it to burn
[39:04.360 --> 39:11.400]  into your head, mine too, that maybe one out of ten of them doesn't hate the
[39:11.400 --> 39:17.360]  country and it's way that an American flag but the rest do and it's like they'll
[39:17.360 --> 39:20.160]  hand illegal aliens out these demonstrations American flags the
[39:20.160 --> 39:23.560]  illegal aliens throw them in the trash and blow up their Mexican flags because
[39:23.560 --> 39:27.080]  at least they've got their blood of their own country, can't even blame them
[39:27.080 --> 39:35.560]  for that but the the average leftist has no identity and then suddenly you know
[39:35.560 --> 39:42.920]  just just suddenly whenever they feel like it
[39:44.560 --> 39:52.240]  at whatever time they want they just roll out some new Messiah here's Obama
[39:52.240 --> 39:57.560]  here he's your Messiah here's Beto here's your Messiah here's Bernie he's
[39:57.560 --> 40:03.880]  your Messiah and then all these people just fall down and start worshiping them
[40:03.880 --> 40:08.440]  and now they're saying there shouldn't be a border there shouldn't be anything
[40:08.440 --> 40:13.880]  well they've all got armed guards and walls they all believe in checkpoints
[40:13.880 --> 40:19.600]  to get to their events in fact they illegally told everybody on Facebook we
[40:19.600 --> 40:22.920]  have law enforcement control you've got to get tickets to even come into
[40:22.920 --> 40:27.120]  Congress from this street to that street you've got to come get wristbands or
[40:27.120 --> 40:30.000]  stickers and you get there they're getting your name and number and
[40:30.000 --> 40:39.040]  enrolling you for Beto and the Democrats and we had our security people that are
[40:39.040 --> 40:43.720]  just off duty police go over and find out it was all a hoax all a criminal
[40:43.720 --> 40:47.920]  fraud well what who do you think the Democrats are they had tables set up
[40:47.920 --> 40:51.800]  down Congress people walking to see this and they were telling him you got to
[40:51.800 --> 40:57.600]  give us your info to get tickets there were no tickets it was all a lie but
[40:57.600 --> 41:04.200]  again they're the party of deception they're the Decepticons to the left-hand
[41:04.200 --> 41:09.440]  path they're all led by psychotics American psycho wannabes like Beto
[41:09.440 --> 41:14.640]  O'Rourke who fantasized about running little kids over and whose father-in-law
[41:14.640 --> 41:18.920]  is one of the most corrupt real estate magnets in the country and would target
[41:18.920 --> 41:25.480]  Hispanics specifically to swindle them and rob them it's all coming out because
[41:25.480 --> 41:29.320]  the Democrats are eating their own now and it's all coming out about Bernie's
[41:29.320 --> 41:35.800]  corruption and it's all coming out about all the other corruption because these
[41:35.800 --> 41:41.560]  people are nasty and bad and so that's really the good news and the bad news
[41:41.560 --> 41:46.120]  is they've reached a level of psychosis themselves that is complete born to rule
[41:46.120 --> 41:51.720]  they're the Messiah Esquire had him in the desert said he's a Messiah it's
[41:51.720 --> 41:56.920]  disgusting he barely got elected as a state rep he lost for the US Senate he
[41:56.920 --> 42:03.320]  hops around on stage and flails his arms he's got a fake name to manipulate
[42:03.320 --> 42:12.400]  Hispanics everything about him is a fraud but he's been positioned for this by
[42:12.400 --> 42:18.560]  his swindling family his entire life he believes he's better than you and he's a
[42:18.560 --> 42:22.600]  predator looking right at you who believes he's gonna eat your lunch and
[42:22.600 --> 42:28.280]  there's nothing you can do to stop him just like Maxine Waters gushes just he
[42:28.280 --> 42:35.440]  smell it is like a son to me it's the correct thing the charges were dropped
[42:36.360 --> 42:41.680]  unbelievably entitled scum rich powerful swindling the public scamming and
[42:41.680 --> 42:45.480]  then doing nothing but saying how much America sucks and how bad white people
[42:45.480 --> 42:55.960]  are unbelievable filth unbelievable racist she's way way worse than even
[42:55.960 --> 43:03.880]  David do a thousand times wars are like 12 round heavyweight boxing championship
[43:03.880 --> 43:09.080]  fights it's about who wants it who's prepared to go the longest and who's

[45:49.240 --> 45:52.640]  brush fires the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be
[45:52.640 --> 45:56.080]  thanks to your support and your prayers together we're changing the world now
[45:56.080 --> 46:00.640]  it's time to change our bodies with Z shield and infowarslife.com there are
[46:00.640 --> 46:04.760]  thousands of ideologies out there hundreds of different political systems
[46:04.760 --> 46:10.000]  and most of them are funded by the globalist info wars is truly the tip of
[46:10.000 --> 46:12.960]  the spear of the zeitgeist that's why the globalists are obsessed with it
[46:12.960 --> 46:17.000]  trying to shut it down I didn't invent all this I went and researched the
[46:17.000 --> 46:21.320]  Renaissance Americana and what really works for humanity and I'm simply
[46:21.320 --> 46:24.880]  trying to bring it back and lo and behold it's super popular like it's
[46:24.880 --> 46:29.600]  always been that's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately
[46:29.600 --> 46:33.720]  because we have the light in the dark of the night that's since chills up my
[46:33.720 --> 46:38.520]  spine so whatever you do continue to support yourself and info wars by buying
[46:38.520 --> 46:42.000]  the great products in infowarstore.com by spreading the articles by spreading the
[46:42.000 --> 46:46.040]  videos and by praying for this operation and for praying for this nation and the
[46:46.040 --> 46:50.040]  world for peace and discernment for myself and the whole info wars family
[46:50.040 --> 46:54.960]  I want to thank all of you for what you've done because without you info wars
[46:54.960 --> 47:05.040]  it's nothing you are the info war and I salute you you're listening to the Alex
[47:05.040 --> 47:34.560]  Jones show there's nowhere on the planet that's on air that will give you the
[47:34.560 --> 47:43.040]  inside scoop on the big picture like info wars until the day I die well that's
[47:43.040 --> 47:47.600]  certainly true but well know how folks in the globalist operation only think
[47:47.600 --> 47:51.880]  about you and your family this is the place by the way this hasn't gotten any
[47:51.880 --> 47:59.040]  attention but Trump has done something today in his tweets that is arguably one
[47:59.040 --> 48:02.200]  of the most important things he's ever done and when I start the next hour at
[48:02.200 --> 48:08.320]  about six after I'm gonna get into this a really big issue that we don't cover
[48:08.320 --> 48:17.520]  enough that on multiple fronts was laid on my heart this morning and then it was
[48:17.520 --> 48:23.200]  even Wilder Pat Riley called me my good friend and he said oh junior came a
[48:23.200 --> 48:27.960]  little bit early today so I guess a few weeks early his wife just had another
[48:27.960 --> 48:34.360]  son and he started talking about how they were already in there trying to
[48:34.360 --> 48:39.720]  inoculate the poor little guy and I realized when I got here today that
[48:39.720 --> 48:46.320]  today is World Autism Day World Autism Awareness Day 2019 significance
[48:46.320 --> 48:53.800]  history and theme via HT tweets so I'll talk about that now I'm gonna open the
[48:53.800 --> 48:59.920]  phones up next hour but it's a big big big deal and it's gonna tie into an
[48:59.920 --> 49:13.160]  extremely powerful Greg Reese report and that ties into this from AP US health
[49:13.160 --> 49:19.240]  officials alarm by paralyzing illness and kids oh they say it's gonna become
[49:19.240 --> 49:27.320]  commonplace and they don't know what it is yeah right sure you know you're such
[49:27.320 --> 49:34.800]  nice people and Trump is trying to stop it and that's why they're so upset we
[49:34.800 --> 49:38.520]  don't know why after our kid got vaccinated or paralyzed a week later G
[49:38.520 --> 49:47.160]  the insert says it can cause Gion beret I mean it says it can do it to you like
[49:47.160 --> 49:51.400]  saying lighting a cigarette up by a gas pump might blow you in the whole place
[49:51.400 --> 49:57.440]  up and you light it up and it spark hits some gas and it says right there on the
[49:57.440 --> 50:10.120]  pump don't light a cigarette dumbass I said I'd cover it next hour and I will
[50:10.120 --> 50:16.600]  but I grew up in Dallas and didn't have any allergies and I thought people that
[50:16.600 --> 50:24.800]  had a more hypochondriacs cuz I got sick like every three four years and then I
[50:24.800 --> 50:30.000]  moved to Austin sort of get allergies and then like I said one time a bunch of
[50:30.000 --> 50:34.320]  bees Africanized bees got mad at me and I got stuck about 15 times what when I
[50:34.320 --> 50:40.760]  tried to run in the house just like a cartoon big you know cloud of bees over
[50:40.760 --> 50:44.640]  me some got in the house had to pull the stairs out of my head boom couldn't
[50:44.640 --> 50:49.440]  breathe swole up red pouring begging so all over me got in the shower it went
[50:49.440 --> 50:55.680]  away I didn't die you understand that a newborn baby is not designed to have
[50:55.680 --> 51:00.040]  outside things put up and when they hit him with now seven different vaccines a
[51:00.040 --> 51:05.200]  day after they're born that a large portion of kids are bring damage for
[51:05.200 --> 51:09.160]  life after that it's just a damn fact you know bees things can cause brain
[51:09.160 --> 51:16.200]  damage right now a bee is putting a lot less poison in you than a damn shot and
[51:16.200 --> 51:20.560]  I dumb it down not because you're dumb but for the general public hey would you
[51:20.560 --> 51:26.600]  want a bunch of bees stinging a newborn baby oh no we don't want that well what
[51:26.600 --> 51:33.960]  about attenuated viruses and bacteria because it doesn't matter if they've
[51:33.960 --> 51:40.400]  broken the RNA of a virus or the DNA of a bacteria those bacteria are carrying
[51:40.400 --> 51:43.600]  all sorts of other little bacteria inside of a microplasms that they've
[51:43.600 --> 51:49.600]  known about for 50 damn years and a lot of times those little guys aren't
[51:49.600 --> 51:54.000]  attenuated so hey you want to get some rheumatoid arthritis take those damn
[51:54.000 --> 52:03.840]  shots my dad retired from dentistry about five years ago I mean he still has his
[52:03.840 --> 52:06.640]  license he still does family and stuff and he still owns a piece of some dental
[52:06.640 --> 52:17.280]  offices in town he's divesting of those right now and my dad's a smart guy he's
[52:17.280 --> 52:21.480]  to argue with me he said son you need calcium fluoride live it's good for your
[52:21.480 --> 52:25.400]  damn teeth and one thing I hear you on air about fluoride being bad I do fluoride
[52:25.400 --> 52:31.880]  treatments all the time we do it it's good and then he saw the head pediatric
[52:31.880 --> 52:35.720]  dentist of Canada who got it floored it up there 20 years ago about a 10 years
[52:35.720 --> 52:40.680]  ago apologized and said I didn't realize we were putting hydrofluorosalic acid
[52:40.680 --> 52:47.000]  in the water that is that is weaponized acid-based deadly fluoride and that
[52:47.000 --> 52:52.120]  causes all sorts of problems in the body and dental fluorosis and my dad'll
[52:52.120 --> 52:56.960]  ever get him over my house he had the report from that guy in a major medical
[52:56.960 --> 53:03.000]  journal he apologized he said son they're getting toxic waste and calling it
[53:03.000 --> 53:07.880]  fluoride and dumping in the water this is insane and they stopped pushing
[53:07.880 --> 53:13.600]  fluoride treatments and stuff at the facilities he owns because he even
[53:13.600 --> 53:20.400]  learned that was the bad fluoride so what I'm getting in here is the average
[53:20.400 --> 53:27.960]  doctor's not bad they just don't know and it's the same thing with the vaccines

[01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:16.520]  key report from mark dice jimmy fouling family grows a pair of levos as you know
[01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:20.680]  the late-night talk shows that stopped being funny on election night 2016 with
[01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:25.600]  most of them showing no signs of returning to comedy anytime soon but
[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:29.720]  there is a glimmer of hope for jimmy fouling who has been the least political
[01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:35.360]  of all of the hosts not wanting to drive away half of his audience in what has to
[01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:39.440]  be the funniest skit on late night TV in over two years jimmy fouling's
[01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:44.680]  impression of beta or work is almost indistinguishable of the fake latino
[01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:48.880]  himself here he is doing an impression of beta's announcement that he's running
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:54.920]  for president I'm better or work and I'm excited that's it I'm just excited oh
[01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:59.440]  yeah I'm also running for president of the United States oh jimmy mocking the
[01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:03.080]  Democrats like that's gonna get just snub from the award shows again for sure
[01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:07.560]  as we recall when he had Donald Trump on his show shortly before the 2016 election
[01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:13.360]  liberals were absolutely furious because he was too nice to him and the rumor has
[01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:18.600]  it that that was the reason why the Emmys snubbed him that year not even
[01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:22.960]  nominating him I'm having increasing suspicions that better or work may be
[01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:28.240]  playing a character and that his entire campaign is a spoof on a Democrats
[01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:33.160]  running for president along this current trajectory there will be people who can
[01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:37.200]  no longer live in the cities that they call home today there is food grown in
[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:42.280]  this country that will no longer prosper in these soils there's gonna be massive
[01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:45.940]  migration of tens or hundreds of millions of people from countries that are
[01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:51.240]  literally uninhabitable or underwater that are above the sea right now this is
[01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:56.760]  our final chance the scientists are absolutely unanimous on this that we
[01:01:56.760 --> 01:02:02.400]  have no more than 12 years to take incredibly bold action on this crisis
[01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:06.880]  the crisis that could at its worst lead to extinction I just love that global
[01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:10.520]  warming is gonna cause the end of the world bit better that's hilarious he
[01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:14.160]  must have drawn inspiration from Stephen Colbert because his old show on
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:18.560]  Comedy Central was based throughout a parody of a crazy Republican only
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:22.960]  bettos put monsieur on the other foot now for his latest bit he's apologized for
[01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:27.520]  his white privilege after he joked a couple times on the campaign trail that
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:33.160]  his wife is raising their kids with a little bit of his help not only will I
[01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:37.640]  not say that again but I will be more thoughtful going forward in the way that
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:42.160]  I talk about our marriage and also the way in which I acknowledge the truth of
[01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:47.560]  the criticism that I have enjoyed white privilege in fact beta's antics are so
[01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:52.440]  strange that even MSNBC is telling him to stop as we turn more and more
[01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:56.160]  attention to 2020 we're gonna be talking more and more about where the
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:03:01.800]  candidates stand and in the case of one betto a work we know countertops
[01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:07.800]  tables places where feet ought not go Robert Francis a work shame on you
[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:13.960]  standing on tables and in shoes no less it hasn't just happened once oh no this
[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:20.720]  is a trend a trend that appears to have legs feet go on the floor sir not on
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:25.640]  surfaces where people eat why can't you be more like Mitt Romney he's so worried
[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:30.840]  about spreading germs he removes the candles from his birthday cake before
[01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:36.640]  he blows them out so I implore you better get off the tabletops be more
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:41.640]  grounded make it your sole responsibility to put your best foot
[01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:46.520]  forward if MSNBC is mocking the Democrats beloved Beto you know there's
[01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:50.000]  something strange going on things are going so bad in the comedy industry
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:55.600]  these days that AT&T direct TV almost dropped Comedy Central from their entire
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:59.240]  distribution the Daily Show is affirmative action hire Trevor Noah
[01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:04.800]  posted this video on Twitter begging his audience to call AT&T direct TV and
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:09.240]  plead with them not to drop Comedy Central I'm Trevor Noah from the Daily
[01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:13.080]  Show and if you think government shutdowns are bad get ready for something
[01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:19.120]  worse AT&T direct TV might drop Comedy Central and up to 22 other Viacom
[01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:23.320]  channels they'll be shutting down your access to all new episodes of your
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:28.080]  favorite shows so take action call AT&T direct TV and let them know that you
[01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:31.960]  want Comedy Central maybe it's just time to bring back Craig Kilborn and make
[01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:36.960]  comedy great again last year my favorite comedian Jay Leno who was fired by NBC's
[01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:41.520]  tonight show despite still being number one after over 20 years said that the
[01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:46.160]  tone of the late-night comedy of the Trump era is depressing after all it
[01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:49.080]  doesn't make much sense to fire someone if they're number one in the ratings
[01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:53.880]  that have been for decades unless they start to up that's right it's not about

[01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:38.360]  Austin which I got told about that I'd have mom in the live feed to a pro
[01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:43.240]  vaccine rally because today is World Autism Day you know we've gone from one
[01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:48.480]  and 35,000 having autism to 158 you go to any public place that has children
[01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:52.280]  large portion of them can't talk most of them are little boys but we're not supposed
[01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:55.840]  to ask why that's happening even though we have the science of no why so there's
[01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:59.720]  an article up on m4s.com that has a lot of feed if you want to see Owen right
[01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:04.800]  now at that event because they're having a pro vaccine rally to get in
[01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:11.800]  everybody's face of course on World Autism Day Owen Schreuer streets of Austin
[01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:16.440]  in fact we'll probably go to some of the as that gets going with the feed is up
[01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:23.480]  live right now now why do I raise that I was already planning to cover vaccines
[01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:28.200]  today because a guy that works here and a guy I was friends with before he worked
[01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:32.920]  here Pat Riley and his wife have their second son and the blood brain barriers
[01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:40.920]  on boys aren't as strong and autoimmune and also allergenic responses
[01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:45.480]  allergic responses in in boys are statistically much worse little baby
[01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:51.200]  girls are much tougher when it comes to surviving gunshot wounds illnesses you
[01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:59.280]  name it that's a fact back to the entire mammal family females are more
[01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:03.400]  resistant to disease the females live longer in every species of mammal because
[01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:06.720]  they've got to carry a baby inside of them they've got to be pretty tough that's
[01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:11.680]  be able to deal with outside threats to the body so men are physically stronger
[01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:16.240]  but women can make a baby and are genetically and at the mitochondrial
[01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:25.600]  level stronger but I digress we've gone from 1 in 35,000 with autism to 1 in 58
[01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:29.120]  the only other place in the world worse is South Korea they give more vaccines
[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:35.200]  it's like 1 in 28 now in fact large portion of their boys are just gone that
[01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:39.160]  they've been brain damaged now the vaccines go in and they cause autoimmune
[01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:43.040]  responses they cause Guillain-Barré's they cause death they cause narcolepsy the
[01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:51.000]  inserts that come by law with the shot container a little ampule say that now
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:55.240]  when you go to a Walgreens or you go to any other clinic they're going to give
[01:08:55.240 --> 01:09:01.440]  you the fact sheet now the fact sheet something they made up it's not the by
[01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:09.080]  law insert you want the package insert you can walk right into CVS or anywhere
[01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:13.520]  and say I'm thinking about taking the flu shot please give me the insert
[01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:18.680]  they'll try to give you a fact sheet oh no no I want the insert and every
[01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:21.360]  container they've got's got one in it they got piles up and back there in the
[01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:27.720]  trash can they'll play dumb but by law they got to give it to you and when they
[01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:33.680]  give it to you it's written in print half the size of a pocket Bible so you get
[01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:39.440]  your magnifying glass out and you look at it now the meme you see on
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:45.120]  screen of your TV viewer has been banned by Facebook and all it is is this is a
[01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:52.600]  vaccine insert and the next to it this is not it's a vaccine BS sheet so
[01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:58.440]  everyone I know has a vaccine horror story my uncle was in high school stepped
[01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:02.840]  on a nail at our farm my dad's brother he was already being looked at to go
[01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:06.680]  directly to professional baseball and just bypass college he was that good as
[01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:13.120]  a pitcher he swole up was in the hospital three weeks and almost died and it he
[01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:18.240]  was never as good at baseball again my mom was on the UT master swimming team
[01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:22.960]  was winning gold and silver medals she didn't start swimming she's about 35 she
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:26.200]  was beating Olympic athletes in swimming they UT told them all get
[01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:29.400]  shots they came again before shot she was in bed for a month and a half lost 40
[01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:36.920]  pounds was never herself again that's how it works show that was bye bye
[01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:42.120]  there for I mean this is this everyone I know I mean I'll be out that on on
[01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:46.520]  vacation or holidays I say in Europe and every time there's a family of three
[01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:49.960]  four kids and there's a little boy who's autistic and I say what happened well at
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:53.040]  18 months he got his third round of shots he was talking running walking and
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:58.120]  then he had convulsions at the clinic or at the school or convulsions when he
[01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:03.560]  got home and then he didn't talk for a month and then this is what we have so
[01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:07.240]  imagine a world where creepy Joe Biden is supposed to squeeze on you and put his
[01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:11.920]  nose in your hair which I agree but the government that's been caught giving
[01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:16.080]  poor people all the world syphilis and all these other secret atomic soldiers
[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:20.400]  and all these programs we're supposed to trust big pharma and bear that knowingly
[01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:24.600]  with the Clintons shipped out millions of ampoules of HIV infected products in
[01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:28.840]  the factor 8 scandal on record and then all the other thousands of things we
[01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:33.960]  know Facebook and Twitter and Google attack anyone now that does this they've
[01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:38.000]  actually organized paid brigades to go out and say anybody that doesn't accept
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:43.440]  all the hundreds of shots we want to give you now as a criminal think about
[01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:46.840]  that and when you go to the hospital you have a baby they go you gotta take the
[01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:49.960]  shot and later the nurses go actually none of us take a man they're deadly
[01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:52.960]  every person I know has been in the military talks about how they'll
[01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:58.120]  that's like a platoon and five people get sick one person dies or it's an
[01:11:58.120 --> 01:12:01.640]  experimental vaccine and they'll give it to the you know special operations guys
[01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:07.200]  and three of them die and a hundred of them get sick out of a thousand what do
[01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:11.960]  you think they're putting in you finally Air Force and Army doctors 20 years ago
[01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:16.720]  said no more anthrac shots and some of them got court-martialed over it they
[01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:24.360]  were giving them the shots it was killing people you can't attenuate
[01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:29.920]  anthrax anthrax has been confirmed to be able to live in the ground 50,000 years
[01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:35.320]  it's a plant spore you can't microwave it and kill it you can't radiate it and
[01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:41.920]  kill it the only way you can kill it is to burn it up until its ashes but they
[01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:49.600]  started giving troops 30 years ago experimental attenuated anthrax vaccine
[01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:54.600]  it's a spore that scientists believe may have created life on this planet I'm
[01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:59.920]  not saying that but it's the toughest thing they've ever found you could shoot
[01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:04.720]  it on a rocket to Mars and it could crash into the Martian soil and be alive
[01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:13.440]  in 10,000 years but they inject a deadly plant spore that replicates in the
[01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:19.040]  tissues of the body into men and women and then wonder why so many get sick and
[01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:22.520]  it was totally experimental it was illegal to give anybody about the
[01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:29.160]  military and then we all know this stuff we're all aware of this they're
[01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:35.280]  engaged in secret testing so Trump came out years ago here's a collection of his
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:39.160]  tweets when we have his new one massive combined inoculations to small
[01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:44.760]  children is a cause for big increase in autism 2012 that's when Baron got so
[01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:49.480]  hurt running around talking super healthy didn't talk for a month or so
[01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:54.000]  crapping all over himself that'll wake up daddy lots of autism and vaccine
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:59.160]  response stop these massive doses immediately go back to single spread out
[01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:04.760]  shots what do we have to lose well yeah Japan does that still overs that queue
[01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:09.200]  healthy young children get goes the doctor gets pumped with massive shots of
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:15.280]  many vaccines doesn't feel good and changes autism many more cases with
[01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:19.520]  autism being way up why do we have to lose having doctors to give small dose
[01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:23.960]  vaccines versus big pump doses oh no because they want to give them 10 15
[01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:28.960]  things at a time that's the eugenics goal I've had the nurses on on record where
[01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:32.760]  they take the preemies you should never give preemies shots to kill them and they
[01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:36.800]  give them extra and then they put them on respirators once they can't breathe oh
[01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:40.560]  the babies died put them on a respirator it's all the eugenics remember the
[01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:47.720]  governor Virginia we keep comfortable autism way up I believe in
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:52.280]  vaccinations but not massive all at once shots too much for small children
[01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:56.080]  to handle government should stop now that's so as you got pressure he started
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:15:01.720]  the back down that's 2014 but notice they don't want that they have hundreds of
[01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:04.560]  shots they want to make mandatory there's already 47 they claim her
[01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:09.080]  mandatory then they lie to you and say it's the law when it's not US health
[01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:14.240]  officials alarmed by paralyzing illnesses in kits
[01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:18.040]  they even admit New York oh all these new diseases are coming in because they
[01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:21.400]  supposedly have eradicated polio but it doesn't always eradicate it it's coming
[01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:24.840]  in out of Latin America so now instead of calling a polio they go oh you're
[01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:28.480]  kid at a polio shot they're protected we don't know what this is even though
[01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:34.480]  something like polio ate his nerves they say oh it's gonna get a lot worse of
[01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:40.160]  course it is because the UN's been caught adding polio to vaccines look it up

[01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:45.440]  so President Trump now comes out World Autism Awareness Day 2019 significance
[01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:51.880]  history and theme via at HT tweets so he's pushing people over to the vaccine
[01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:59.960]  damage awareness group of victims who see it and others keep calling bullies and
[01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:04.360]  how they do this is they claim oh pro-vaxxers had somebody say something
[01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:08.040]  mean to him once on Facebook or Twitter probably the left doing it probably
[01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:11.840]  smelling thing but how about millions of dead kids how about millions of brain
[01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:16.520]  damage kids how about vaccines being given government liability protection
[01:21:16.520 --> 01:21:20.760]  where they can't get in trouble for what's in an old history of secret
[01:21:20.760 --> 01:21:27.320]  experimentation so my friend Pat Riley just had his second son overnight with
[01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:36.640]  his wife and so let's document Kim zoom in on this please and he sent us a
[01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:44.040]  copy of what they gave him and it's all meant to make it look like they care
[01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:47.080]  about you and again the doctors compartmentalized the nurses are
[01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:49.880]  compartmentalized most of the nurses I've had four kids in hospitals are
[01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:53.920]  lizards and say oh my god we we know vaccines are got bad stuff and we see
[01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:57.440]  it kill kids we see it hurt the premiums and they shouldn't be giving it to
[01:21:57.440 --> 01:22:05.760]  pregnant women and it's all there so it shows the mother in the baby if you're
[01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:11.000]  a radio listener I'll describe it this is welcome to the mother baby unit it
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:16.120]  says birth certificate worksheet completed mother and newborn vaccines and
[01:22:16.120 --> 01:22:22.640]  information cards oh now we give the mommy shots and then it goes through the
[01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:25.600]  hep B and the other ones they gave you that are really deadly and really hurt
[01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:34.440]  people verify obtained correct pediatrician lactation consultant and
[01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:37.880]  they really did try to get your kid on formulas that a smaller brain and then
[01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:44.160]  pediatrician identified to hand them off newborn heart screen that's important
[01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:51.000]  caring screen 24 hours newborn blood draw now they could test this right
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:55.240]  there on the spot they send it off to a UN database I exposed this first in
[01:22:55.240 --> 01:23:00.240]  1997 with nurses in San Antonio at the military base and there were lawsuits
[01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:04.800]  filed in Minnesota and Texas years later confirming that there's a secret global
[01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:09.000]  DNA database with your blood and it sold to big tech pharma who then later when
[01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:13.400]  you want to get a genetic testing or treatment they claim they own your DNA
[01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:21.320]  and your proteins and your genetic treatments you can get that's that's
[01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:25.960]  major headlines where people going to get a genetic treatment they oh sorry we
[01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:29.200]  took your blood decades ago when you were born we own you not kidding look it
[01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:34.720]  up so they they practice kids foot get a bunch of blood it's not for testing blood

[01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:56.240]  to declare it a national emergency and so they forced it they had to pull it
[01:25:56.240 --> 01:26:00.520]  back because of so many deaths but they'll still push it on you they're
[01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:04.360]  seeing what they get away with and it's not the whole government it's criminal

[01:33:29.480 --> 01:33:39.560]  me well so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones all
[01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:46.440]  right remember it was Adam P. Schiff that made up all the Russiagate crap as a
[01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:53.440]  criminal involved in all of it facing indictment himself but sent letters to
[01:33:53.440 --> 01:34:01.800]  Facebook in the middle of February on Valentine's Day a sick evil insult to
[01:34:01.800 --> 01:34:06.600]  the children saying anybody that disagrees with vaccination is medical
[01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:11.120]  disinfo and must be taken down so now if citizens want to go tell you what
[01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:14.320]  happened to them when they took a shot or what happened to their kids you can't
[01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:17.520]  do it well you can tell people if you like the barbecue place or if you like
[01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:24.040]  the ballet but you're a mother or father you want to go online and tell folks hey
[01:34:24.040 --> 01:34:26.760]  my kid had convulsions after their shots they never talked again and now
[01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:31.400]  craps all of themselves so many warned people you ain't doing it cuz Schiff
[01:34:31.400 --> 01:34:37.680]  says no cuz he's a damn predator again over 10,000 declassified projects many
[01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:42.320]  of which were killing people on purpose run by criminal eugenics cults in our
[01:34:42.320 --> 01:34:46.920]  government what you think the only cults out there cutting their ding-dongs off
[01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:50.960]  and taking barbiturates and vodka to put on their Nike tennis shoes and fly up
[01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:54.800]  to hell bop they're out in California and of course that was a big IT group in
[01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:59.600]  Silicon Valley that runs the gamut that's just par for the course with these
[01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:08.120]  loons and their God believes we should be depopulated before they ascend now I
[01:35:08.120 --> 01:35:12.880]  don't believe this but I'm telling you it's a depopulation cult and that's why
[01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:18.960]  AOC I'm uncover that next segment and Beto and all of them are saying the world
[01:35:18.960 --> 01:35:24.520]  is going to end they want an apocalyptic attitude so you give up so they can rob
[01:35:24.520 --> 01:35:32.920]  everything it's a talking point these people mean business now speaking of
[01:35:32.920 --> 01:35:37.360]  that there's a report up on info wars.com A-list rap artist Nipsey Hussle
[01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:44.760]  murdered after plans to expose big pharma now what's incredible about this
[01:35:44.760 --> 01:35:50.560]  report is regardless of he was killed because of a film he was working on I
[01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:56.960]  don't know we don't know he's that's a question at the end Greg Reese great
[01:35:56.960 --> 01:36:03.360]  researcher pulls up mainstream news articles from the 80s and the 70s when
[01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:08.560]  they patented HIV when they put it in the vaccines in New York City use gay men
[01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:12.200]  as the vector because they had a lot of sexual partners where they gave it to
[01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:19.120]  Africans I mean that's a fact that's not a rumor and then people say well it
[01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:21.800]  isn't as fatal as it used to be that's because they've got treatments they've
[01:36:21.800 --> 01:36:26.960]  suppressed but they don't give those the general public also viruses tend to
[01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:31.080]  mutate and so a lot of viruses will mutate into something deadly they'll
[01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:35.680]  also mutate out of something deadly so you got to have the original batch to
[01:36:35.680 --> 01:36:39.600]  re-inoculate to cause it and see the globalists say there's so many people
[01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:43.160]  and let's just say they're right seven and a half billion people this is how
[01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:48.560]  they call China says you know you only have one kid so don't lie to yourselves
[01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:54.080]  don't lie to yourselves they give premature babies vaccines because of 10
[01:36:54.080 --> 01:36:57.400]  years ago it said don't it'll kill them they want them dead and they want to
[01:36:57.400 --> 01:37:01.120]  manage your kid dying and the nurses getting used to it so they can really
[01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:07.240]  start killing people it's called successive approximation incrementalism
[01:37:07.240 --> 01:37:14.880]  not go read a history book on Hitler taking power they're all the same first
[01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:21.400]  thing he did was to get the doctors on his side because the doctor says this
[01:37:21.400 --> 01:37:28.440]  the doctor says that the doctor says that we've got to kill your baby that's
[01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:32.000]  where the abortion and the eugenics and then the fantasies started in the
[01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:38.120]  killing old people and pretty soon it was everybody understand I know you
[01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:42.680]  understand and so that's where all this comes from and IBM helped run the whole
[01:37:42.680 --> 01:37:46.600]  thing do you think they can have us on Facebook talking about this or on
[01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:52.360]  Twitter or on YouTube no they can't they don't want you to know what I've told
[01:37:52.360 --> 01:38:00.400]  you everything is admitted now HIV has killed hundreds of millions of people
[01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:04.520]  but they've used HIV infection as a cover for a bunch of other deadly stuff
[01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:10.920]  they've been testing in Africa and the globalist said it's only fair if we all
[01:38:10.920 --> 01:38:16.680]  sign on and so the argument was in the 60s these are in white papers I've
[01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:23.120]  covered I make films about it in game in game 2.0 that if we kill people out
[01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:27.400]  right here folks will notice there'll be an opposition we've got a soft kill and
[01:38:27.400 --> 01:38:33.200]  then test it on the public to see if the nurses and doctors in public notice
[01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:42.480]  but we'll actually just wound people so they don't reproduce so the male is
[01:38:42.480 --> 01:38:46.080]  brain damaged and never talks again or is autistic he's not gonna be having
[01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:53.600]  kids so the argument was we'll just lobotomize them that's it and they're
[01:38:53.600 --> 01:38:56.040]  just upping the amount it just gets worse and worse they're just see okay
[01:38:56.040 --> 01:39:01.040]  okay they're used to like okay it's one and 35,000 it's you know one and 20,000
[01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:04.800]  it's one of 15,000 it's one in 10,000 it's one at 5,000 it's one in 1,000 it's
[01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:11.800]  one in 85 it's one in 74 it's one in 58 okay they're not resisting turn it up
[01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:16.680]  and add more and then they're just frying us let's go to Greg Reese's
[01:39:16.680 --> 01:39:24.080]  report here it is this weekend the city of Los Angeles lost a valuable member of
[01:39:24.080 --> 01:39:30.240]  their community a list rap artist and community you know what I rarely do this
[01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:32.400]  I looked at the clock wrong I was looking at another report this three and a
[01:39:32.400 --> 01:39:34.480]  half minutes this is a four and a half minute report I have to go to that when
[01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:43.480]  come back from break sorry but this is a fact it's a fact hospitals keep babies
[01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:50.360]  alive and take their organs if they've got a working-class mom who's alone she
[01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:56.360]  comes in her water is broken the bioethics board thing clicks through they
[01:39:56.360 --> 01:40:00.600]  find drugs in her body they can say well this baby in the actuary the
[01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:04.280]  computers programmed might end up being a drug addicts gonna have problems they
[01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:07.960]  say bad gene pool we've been seen that testimony that clicks out to the
[01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:13.000]  bioethics board we got a genetic match this hospital group to make $500,000 off
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:20.920]  this all right induced labor take the child have police arrest the woman the
[01:40:20.920 --> 01:40:24.760]  police don't even know say that she's got drugs in her say the babies got an
[01:40:24.760 --> 01:40:28.960]  illness we're gonna decide we can save them it's taken to a special wing it is
[01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:34.420]  put on opiates to keep it comfortable as the governor Virginia said and they
[01:40:34.420 --> 01:40:39.240]  harvest that baby within a few days and sell the goods now that's how you start
[01:40:39.240 --> 01:40:43.920]  a hardcore cult and then suddenly the nurses that aren't even on that wing
[01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:48.480]  start getting big bonuses big raises and the nurses on the wing start making
[01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:55.640]  $300,000 a year and it's it's over you've now got an army of doom and once
[01:40:55.640 --> 01:40:59.640]  you've got an army of doom who's a hardcore professional group of crooks
[01:40:59.640 --> 01:41:03.840]  who believe what they're doing a computer told them do it bioethics the
[01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:08.160]  doctors are making five million a year the hospital groups making billions and
[01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:11.640]  it's a big joke and it's a charity hospital with a big old cross on the
[01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:17.320]  side and they're killing babies in there baby and the mama just knows I'm sorry
[01:41:17.320 --> 01:41:22.080]  I got on heroin or whatever I'm sorry well and then well we'll see how your

[01:43:03.480 --> 01:43:08.880]  globalist info wars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist that's why
[01:43:08.880 --> 01:43:12.440]  the globalists are obsessed with it trying to shut it down I didn't invent
[01:43:12.440 --> 01:43:16.400]  all this I went and researched the Renaissance Americana and what really
[01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:20.440]  works for humanity and I'm simply trying to bring it back and lo and behold
[01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:24.880]  it's super popular like it's always been that's why the globalists are trying
[01:43:24.880 --> 01:43:29.400]  to shut it down so desperately because we have the light in the dark of the
[01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:33.720]  night that's since chills up my spine so whatever you do continue to support

[01:45:01.960 --> 01:45:05.520]  environment from the bad halogens fluoride chlorine bromide you name it
[01:45:05.520 --> 01:45:11.400]  that it lowers IQ it literally dumps the population down and on our quest to
[01:45:11.400 --> 01:45:15.200]  bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world we've gone through
[01:45:15.200 --> 01:45:20.360]  two permutations first seaweed based iodine that was pretty good but hard to
[01:45:20.360 --> 01:45:23.760]  source and the globalist tried to block us getting a supply of it so we
[01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:28.360]  discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought UX2 that's
[01:45:28.360 --> 01:45:32.200]  been incredible now due to the establishment trying to block that we
[01:45:32.200 --> 01:45:36.640]  did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine
[01:45:36.640 --> 01:45:41.360]  but chemist scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it
[01:45:41.360 --> 01:45:46.920]  with three other compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin C it super charges it
[01:45:46.920 --> 01:45:52.080]  and makes it even more bio available ladies and gentlemen you want to
[01:45:52.080 --> 01:45:56.640]  research it you want to see it it's an incredible discovery x3 now available

[01:47:19.720 --> 01:47:26.000]  sell these horrible things to be mean everybody knows about the drugs that
[01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:31.320]  kill people and the thin thin anti-fat drug that destroys your heart everybody
[01:47:31.320 --> 01:47:39.960]  knows about any depressants they gave women back in the 50s and 60s that caused
[01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:45.400]  kids to have deformed arms and legs but nowadays you complain about what all
[01:47:45.400 --> 01:47:48.800]  these drugs are doing they tell you you're crazy shut up you're not allowed
[01:47:48.800 --> 01:47:52.240]  to talk about that and by the way they've got laws in Congress are trying to
[01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:56.120]  pass where you won't see the drug ads on TV anymore where they've got to tell you
[01:47:56.120 --> 01:47:59.320]  it might kill you might cause you to have a heart attack might cause you to go
[01:47:59.320 --> 01:48:03.800]  crazy you always hear what they got to tell you just a few of the hundreds of
[01:48:03.800 --> 01:48:07.840]  side effects it's always people having a great time but by the way this might
[01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:11.960]  kill you and notice most the ads they go by the way if you've ever had vaccines
[01:48:11.960 --> 01:48:17.480]  lately you can't take this or by the way do you have an autoimmune response you
[01:48:17.480 --> 01:48:22.920]  can't take this I know two people in this building whose children died from
[01:48:22.920 --> 01:48:27.080]  vaccines and the government told them one worked in the army and special
[01:48:27.080 --> 01:48:29.880]  operations they were deployed overseas and they gave the daughter multiple
[01:48:29.880 --> 01:48:34.760]  shots and killed her and while they were overseas and then another person I
[01:48:34.760 --> 01:48:37.840]  won't even get into the tales that their child died and that they told no
[01:48:37.840 --> 01:48:44.320]  vaccine yet autoimmune response but then I was another person worked here a
[01:48:44.320 --> 01:48:52.000]  while back and she went overseas to the east and they told her the state
[01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:56.800]  department said you've got to take these shots she took the shots months
[01:48:56.800 --> 01:49:00.840]  before she was to go it almost killed her she couldn't breathe was getting numb
[01:49:00.840 --> 01:49:07.880]  everything she took another job and they told her they said you probably can't
[01:49:07.880 --> 01:49:11.640]  ever take another vaccine because now you're allergic to them just like a
[01:49:11.640 --> 01:49:16.760]  bee sting it'll kill you they know this I'm telling you things that are like
[01:49:16.760 --> 01:49:21.800]  red lights mean stop yellow means slow down and get ready to stop green means
[01:49:21.800 --> 01:49:33.040]  go that's why I'm so frustrated I'm not telling you something that I just made
[01:49:33.040 --> 01:49:36.960]  up that's why they go through the whole history of what I've done try to find a
[01:49:36.960 --> 01:49:40.080]  few things where I was wrong or not certain and then they go hey admit
[01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:45.280]  you're wrong okay I was wrong he admits everything's a fraud he's a scammer
[01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:55.240]  they have a secret vaccine fund that has four plus billion dollars in it and
[01:49:55.240 --> 01:49:58.680]  they secretly pay the money out and they make you waive your rights and you'll
[01:49:58.680 --> 01:50:01.640]  have like a dead kid they give you a couple hundred thousand dollars and
[01:50:01.640 --> 01:50:06.880]  that's if you go through all the hoops it's unbelievable all right I want to go
[01:50:06.880 --> 01:50:11.400]  to this A-list rap artist nipsey hustle murdered after plans to expose big pharma
[01:50:11.400 --> 01:50:16.520]  and the guy's just outside his business shop and a dude comes over that cool in
[01:50:16.520 --> 01:50:21.200]  front of his girlfriend and kills him by the way how is CNN I'm not even gonna
[01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:26.000]  show it I didn't show the other things I'm gonna show it how is CNN showing
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:30.440]  nipsey hustle getting gunned down right in the chest and head I mean it's boom
[01:50:30.440 --> 01:50:37.000]  boom right there but nobody can show what happened in New Zealand by the way
[01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.960]  we just showed shots of his gun and him going in because I don't want to show
[01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:45.840]  that our TV stations don't want that on air I'm not I came in and said we're not
[01:50:45.840 --> 01:50:49.360]  airing that they my crew didn't want to air it we didn't want to say the guy's
[01:50:49.360 --> 01:50:55.520]  name but we had to because the media was they took down a bunch of people's
[01:50:55.520 --> 01:50:59.960]  YouTube channels and said because Jones showed the shooting no I didn't but the
[01:50:59.960 --> 01:51:04.080]  point is they can show the shootings but we can again this double standard never
[01:51:04.080 --> 01:51:09.440]  ends but let me tell you if you're a radio listener this is powerful but if
[01:51:09.440 --> 01:51:13.120]  you are a TV viewer it's really powerful because you can see all the mainstream
[01:51:13.120 --> 01:51:18.800]  news articles and I've forgotten the patents and the mainstream news I was
[01:51:18.800 --> 01:51:22.920]  promiscuous and I'm not even proud of this because it was fun for a while
[01:51:22.920 --> 01:51:28.120]  but it wasn't fun but the 80s were crazy late 80s were just wild that was way
[01:51:28.120 --> 01:51:33.000]  crazier in the 60s and I remember a few times when I was like 16 or so I was
[01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:36.320]  like going out some 25-year-old women and stuff that were pretty wild I wasn't
[01:51:36.320 --> 01:51:39.880]  going to topless bars if I was dating topless girls and stuff and my dad was
[01:51:39.880 --> 01:51:43.480]  laughing he goes son you got to worry about syphilis or hepatitis or something
[01:51:43.480 --> 01:51:46.680]  you shouldn't be doing that you shouldn't be having sex for your marriage you
[01:51:46.680 --> 01:51:51.280]  should wear economy if you are but he goes HIV is a bio weapon and it's almost
[01:51:51.280 --> 01:51:54.560]  impossible for whites to get it unless it's a large blood transfusion and it's
[01:51:54.560 --> 01:51:58.920]  been in the news that it was putting the gay men's vaccines in the late 1970s and
[01:51:58.920 --> 01:52:02.680]  the beers he had like literature and stuff on it and and later that all
[01:52:02.680 --> 01:52:07.160]  turned out to be true but that's what's so crazy about all this is that this is
[01:52:07.160 --> 01:52:14.200]  hiding in plain view this is all hiding in plain view it's going on and we
[01:52:14.200 --> 01:52:18.040]  won't research it or say no and now they're trying to bully us take even
[01:52:18.040 --> 01:52:22.640]  more vaccines my god what's it gonna take one in ten kids being brain damaged
[01:52:22.640 --> 01:52:28.920]  and understand what's happening let's go to the report here it is this weekend
[01:52:28.920 --> 01:52:34.600]  the city of Los Angeles lost a valuable member of their community A-list rap
[01:52:34.600 --> 01:52:39.960]  artist and community philanthropist Nipsey Hussle was gunned down in broad
[01:52:39.960 --> 01:52:46.160]  daylight without clear evidence of a motive his murder is being portrayed as
[01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:53.400]  gang violence but many suspect he was assassinated to silence him Nipsey
[01:52:53.400 --> 01:52:57.560]  Hussle was producing a documentary about Dr. Sebe I think the story is
[01:52:57.560 --> 01:53:01.160]  important I think it's a powerful narrative you know what I mean and I
[01:53:01.160 --> 01:53:06.160]  think if imagine this anybody in this room if I could say hey somebody cured
[01:53:06.160 --> 01:53:11.560]  AIDS I'll be like yeah right and then I can show you an example of him going to
[01:53:11.560 --> 01:53:18.080]  trial proven in a court to a jury that he cured AIDS I'll be interested in that
[01:53:18.080 --> 01:53:22.680]  absolutely and y'all would look into the way he did it right Dr. Sebe was a
[01:53:22.680 --> 01:53:28.360]  Honduran herbalist known for successfully curing AIDS what is most
[01:53:28.360 --> 01:53:33.840]  interesting is that in 1988 Dr. Sebe took his case to the Supreme Court and
[01:53:33.840 --> 01:53:39.880]  won the judge asked Dr. Sebe to provide a single witness who is cured of AIDS
[01:53:39.880 --> 01:53:46.320]  Dr. Sebe provided 77 proving in a court of law that his claims were legitimate
[01:53:46.320 --> 01:53:54.280]  in 2016 Dr. Sebe was arrested and died in jail his arrest records have not been
[01:53:54.280 --> 01:53:59.520]  released so it remains unclear as to why he was arrested in the first place
[01:53:59.520 --> 01:54:04.640]  Nipsey Hussle believed that Dr. Sebe was murdered to protect the pharmaceutical
[01:54:04.640 --> 01:54:10.720]  industries capital gain on the same day as Nipsey's murder the University of
[01:54:10.720 --> 01:54:16.240]  California announced that we need funding to eliminate new HIV infections
[01:54:16.240 --> 01:54:22.200]  their solution is a lifetime dependence to pharmaceuticals costing thousands of
[01:54:22.200 --> 01:54:27.200]  dollars a month the black community has been stricken with AIDS more than
[01:54:27.200 --> 01:54:33.400]  anyone else according to so-called experts this is due to stigma fear
[01:54:33.400 --> 01:54:40.720]  discrimination and homophobia no it's a bio weapon in 2003 Dr. Boyd Graves sued
[01:54:40.720 --> 01:54:46.120]  the US government claiming that the HIV AIDS virus was designed as biological
[01:54:46.120 --> 01:54:53.040]  terrorism against African-Americans in the lawsuit Dr. Graves submitted Dr.
[01:54:53.040 --> 01:54:59.440]  Robert Gallows 1971 special virus paper which reveals how the United States was
[01:54:59.440 --> 01:55:04.480]  seeking a virus particle that would negatively impact the defense mechanisms
[01:55:04.480 --> 01:55:10.760]  of the immune system in 1978 is a big new Brzezinski submitted National
[01:55:10.760 --> 01:55:16.320]  Security Council Memorandum 46 to the Secretary of State the Secretary of
[01:55:16.320 --> 01:55:21.520]  Defense and the Director of Central Intelligence Brzezinski recommended
[01:55:21.520 --> 01:55:27.360]  that special clandestine operations should be launched by the CIA to generate
[01:55:27.360 --> 01:55:33.320]  mistrust and hostility in order to disrupt the black community in April
[01:55:33.320 --> 01:55:38.760]  1984 Dr. Robert Gallo filed a United States patent application for his
[01:55:38.760 --> 01:55:45.840]  invention the HIV AIDS virus Dr. Graves claims the AIDS virus was added as a
[01:55:45.840 --> 01:55:51.000]  compliment by pharmaceutical company Merck to experimental vaccines given to
[01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:56.520]  homosexuals and members of the black community in America and Africa shortly
[01:55:56.520 --> 01:56:01.400]  thereafter the two regions were overwhelmed with mass infections of the
[01:56:01.400 --> 01:56:08.040]  AIDS virus we know that the US government is capable of doing this in
[01:56:08.040 --> 01:56:13.560]  1932 the Public Health Service working with the Tuskegee Institute allowed
[01:56:13.560 --> 01:56:18.440]  hundreds of black men to die of syphilis while countless others were allowed to
[01:56:18.440 --> 01:56:23.680]  be infected with the disease was Nipsey Hussle murdered to keep him from
[01:56:23.680 --> 01:56:30.640]  exposing these crimes to his massive audience sadly the world may never know
[01:56:30.640 --> 01:56:35.520]  but now artist Nick Cannon has hinted towards wanting to finish Nipsey's

[02:00:25.400 --> 02:00:30.440]  some jurisdictions 70 plus percent of blacks never get born the national
[02:00:30.440 --> 02:00:35.680]  average is close to 50 there's some virtues signal for black people a lot
[02:00:35.680 --> 02:00:39.080]  of black people are angry mean evil racist brainwashed against me because
[02:00:39.080 --> 02:00:42.680]  I'm white doesn't matter I'm taking a high road a lot of black folks are great
[02:00:42.680 --> 02:00:47.600]  people and their children certainly are innocent don't deserve to die so the
[02:00:47.600 --> 02:00:50.680]  number one enemy of black people is black leaders who've been bought off and
[02:00:50.680 --> 02:00:53.360]  won't stand up for them that's the bottom line your calls coming up next
[02:00:53.360 --> 02:00:59.600]  segment ladies and gentlemen we are running a special right now that we've
[02:00:59.600 --> 02:01:08.560]  never run before and even though DNA force overall is our most profitable
[02:01:08.560 --> 02:01:14.840]  product and that's because people that know in the market what it is
[02:01:14.840 --> 02:01:22.240]  understand it's an incredibly good deal the problem is only athletes and folks
[02:01:22.240 --> 02:01:26.840]  that are really into health understand bio pqq coq 10 other things like this
[02:01:26.840 --> 02:01:34.000]  that come from organically produced sources the average person is an end
[02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:37.960]  of vitamins or minerals or supplements and then only folks that are really into
[02:01:37.960 --> 02:01:46.440]  it know about how special it is and so when they see us shelling DNA force
[02:01:46.440 --> 02:01:54.640]  plus and the dosages of real pqq and coq 10 they go it's a hundred and fifty
[02:01:54.640 --> 02:02:02.440]  bucks normally when the lowest price leading competitors like 300 and people
[02:02:02.440 --> 02:02:09.760]  get it through medical clinics because it is a great new tropic it's a great
[02:02:09.760 --> 02:02:13.400]  thing for the whole body for all the cells for the bones for the DNA for the
[02:02:13.400 --> 02:02:18.080]  telomeres for the nerves but but but people aren't ready to pay that so they
[02:02:18.080 --> 02:02:22.520]  have synthetic pqq and coq 10 the stores it's still 50 60 bucks for a little
[02:02:22.520 --> 02:02:29.640]  big bottle and the word is the synthetic doesn't even get absorbed so I shut
[02:02:29.640 --> 02:02:35.480]  out to give you the best and back when it was costing us 50 60 bucks a bottle
[02:02:35.480 --> 02:02:40.000]  we were selling it for 110 $120 bottle we got to get our money back and fun
[02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:47.800]  things but I made a big enough deal to sign a contract out a few years to get
[02:02:47.800 --> 02:02:54.680]  a super discount on this but now I got to move a lot of it so it's normally a
[02:02:54.680 --> 02:03:01.840]  hundred bucks now 110 bucks or so it's now right now an info wars store.com
[02:03:01.840 --> 02:03:07.920]  selling for only 60 dollars let's let's let's pull that up and put that on
[02:03:07.920 --> 02:03:15.880]  screen for folks it's selling for $59.80 right now 97% reviews for DNA
[02:03:15.880 --> 02:03:20.480]  plus the new formula of DNA force because we made even stronger by the way
[02:03:20.480 --> 02:03:26.400]  and I made the better deal so it's a great deal in 110 bucks or so it is
[02:03:26.400 --> 02:03:33.120]  unbelievably insane at $59 and the money we do make obviously funds this
[02:03:33.120 --> 02:03:39.480]  operation so it's like X2 though the good halogen it takes a few weeks for you
[02:03:39.480 --> 02:03:44.280]  to notice the results but if you just get a bottle and take it you think
[02:03:44.280 --> 02:03:48.200]  carrots are good for your eyes you think antioxidants are good for your skin you
[02:03:48.200 --> 02:03:53.120]  think I mean it's a joke what happens with this and it's proven you can say
[02:03:53.120 --> 02:03:58.480]  it slows the deterioration of the telomeres that means they they don't die
[02:03:58.480 --> 02:04:03.200]  as fast you can say that makes them last longer half empty half full it does so

[02:05:57.240 --> 02:06:15.760]  you found it the tip of the spear it is the Alex Jones show
[02:06:15.760 --> 02:06:22.720]  that must be some kind of way out of here you think Jimmy Hendricks gonna come
[02:06:22.720 --> 02:06:30.560]  up with the total revolution of Beethoven level skill if he'd have been
[02:06:30.560 --> 02:06:35.880]  given 20 30 vaccines by the way let's look up where Jimmy Hendricks was from
[02:06:35.880 --> 02:06:43.000]  I forget Seattle Washington imagine how Jimmy Hendricks would have done if he
[02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:48.000]  got injected with live syphilis that was going on when he was born and told it
[02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:55.640]  was a vaccine see just just remember our government did that and you've got the
[02:06:55.640 --> 02:06:59.200]  governor of Virginia and you've got the governor of New York passing a law the
[02:06:59.200 --> 02:07:03.080]  governor of Virginia endorsing killing babies after born and then you tell me I
[02:07:03.080 --> 02:07:08.400]  should trust vaccines that are given liability protection by these people
[02:07:08.400 --> 02:07:16.560]  and I'm not up here virtue signaling that black people
[02:07:17.880 --> 02:07:23.360]  black people are some of the most racist hateful people out there so are
[02:07:23.360 --> 02:07:30.320]  white people but you know who's the most racist and that's Asians by the way my
[02:07:30.320 --> 02:07:34.640]  sister is an American she's Korean adopted it's cultural you know how
[02:07:34.640 --> 02:07:41.040]  culturally insular Korea or China ish but you never hear a word about how
[02:07:41.040 --> 02:07:47.480]  they don't let anybody into China or anybody into Japan they don't let one
[02:07:47.480 --> 02:07:53.000]  Muslim into Japan because them the Japanese look at the culture and they
[02:07:53.000 --> 02:08:00.320]  say you always conquer who you move into you you never as long as in this
[02:08:00.320 --> 02:08:06.080]  little bitty spot 1400 years ago in Mecca and Medina and now it's all over
[02:08:06.080 --> 02:08:11.240]  the world like a good case of cancer so I agree with Japan shaking up for their
[02:08:11.240 --> 02:08:16.920]  culture I don't think that's racist to say that we've got our own thing going
[02:08:16.920 --> 02:08:25.280]  on here and what's the way it works and you don't love it leave it but China or
[02:08:25.280 --> 02:08:29.200]  they believe they rule Asia they like the master race thing like the Germans
[02:08:29.200 --> 02:08:35.400]  believe they rule Europe and I can't repeat the stuff that's on the Chinese
[02:08:35.400 --> 02:08:47.720]  news about black people and so I'm gonna say it right now the West is the best
[02:08:47.720 --> 02:08:51.680]  for women's rights for minorities rights for everybody everybody ought to be
[02:08:51.680 --> 02:08:57.880]  kissing America's ass instead of pissing all over it and I'm not gonna take it
[02:08:57.880 --> 02:09:01.640]  anymore and you're like well wait a minute you're saying the government's
[02:09:01.640 --> 02:09:09.080]  giving black people syphilis that's not America you study real church hearings
[02:09:09.080 --> 02:09:12.760]  and other hearings in Congress you don't just think they made in the late 90s
[02:09:12.760 --> 02:09:16.440]  enemy of the state with Will Smith and Gene Hackman great movie I mentioned
[02:09:16.440 --> 02:09:19.960]  yesterday I gotta rewatch that this is so accurate you don't just think they
[02:09:19.960 --> 02:09:28.520]  just made that I know where that's based on a composite of real events of where
[02:09:28.520 --> 02:09:32.640]  rogue groups use the power of government to do what they want government is like
[02:09:32.640 --> 02:09:40.120]  fire a dangerous servant and a fearful master George Washington I love America
[02:09:40.120 --> 02:09:45.240]  it's a great country it's done amazing things but humans are evil and we got a
[02:09:45.240 --> 02:09:51.120]  long list evil we've done but some of all these other countries and as they
[02:09:51.120 --> 02:09:56.600]  ever had the power we've had they'd be 50 times worse I've studied this country
[02:09:56.600 --> 02:10:03.520]  I'm proud to be an American and it's those of us standing down and letting
[02:10:03.520 --> 02:10:07.960]  scum take over and bully us and tell us we're bad people so we sit out and shut

[02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:33.920]  that I'm your brother but let me tell you something right now if you're a
[02:10:33.920 --> 02:10:43.680]  psychotic swindlin nutcase narcissistic clown like Maxine waters who
[02:10:43.680 --> 02:10:47.840]  stole tens of millions of dollars to her own husband's company on record but
[02:10:47.840 --> 02:10:54.200]  nobody didn't die to her ass cuz she's black that woman is a cancer on black
[02:10:54.200 --> 02:11:00.600]  people governor Cuomo is a cancer on America these people are scum and they've
[02:11:00.600 --> 02:11:04.840]  gotten away with bloody murder now I got four of these interviews I'm only gonna
[02:11:04.840 --> 02:11:13.240]  air one of them but Maxine waters at the NAACP awards got up and said he
[02:11:13.240 --> 02:11:19.120]  didn't deserve to be charged smell it and that he's a good guy that's good
[02:11:19.120 --> 02:11:25.560]  that he was found innocent he wasn't found innocent he was let off for trying
[02:11:25.560 --> 02:11:29.440]  to cause a damn race war and he sits there I looked it up that guy in the
[02:11:29.440 --> 02:11:33.960]  years he's been on Empire has made like seven million dollars he's got all these
[02:11:33.960 --> 02:11:40.440]  other businesses he lives in a multi-million dollar condo he's got a
[02:11:40.440 --> 02:11:45.000]  million dollar car he's got more stuff than I got and he's bitchin about this
[02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:50.000]  country screw you man you know how many people are putting their lives on the
[02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:53.600]  line and having to be on food stamps and including non-commissioned officers
[02:11:53.600 --> 02:11:57.720]  and serving five six turds to protect your sorry ass while you shit there
[02:11:57.720 --> 02:12:03.000]  pissing on this country you piece of garbage you maggot you make me sick god
[02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:09.920]  almighty but let me tell you who really makes me mad Maxine waters doesn't say a
[02:12:09.920 --> 02:12:13.280]  damn thing about half the black kids never getting out of their mommy she
[02:12:13.280 --> 02:12:17.600]  doesn't say a damn thing about HIV and the black population being targeted she
[02:12:17.600 --> 02:12:24.560]  doesn't say crap because she's a big shit monster for the system now I'm gonna
[02:12:24.560 --> 02:12:26.760]  you can pause it because there's four or five these interviews I watched this
[02:12:26.760 --> 02:12:29.520]  morning there's an article in fours comm it's got close out different ones
[02:12:29.520 --> 02:12:33.920]  here's just some of the crap coming out of her mouth about small it who just
[02:12:33.920 --> 02:12:37.200]  tried to cause a race war you know working with Obama and why is she
[02:12:37.200 --> 02:12:42.040]  defending him because she knows it because this is who she is she wants
[02:12:42.040 --> 02:12:45.640]  black people to think the average white person's out to get them well that's not
[02:12:45.640 --> 02:12:54.200]  the truth she's a you know what liar and she's a damn enemy of this country go
[02:12:54.200 --> 02:12:58.560]  ahead and roll that which I have to ask you because you were one of the first
[02:12:58.560 --> 02:13:05.840]  people to defend and now we've all of the recent changes and everything
[02:13:05.840 --> 02:13:10.280]  has come out and the charges being dropped yes what are your feelings it's
[02:13:10.280 --> 02:13:14.520]  the correct thing that the charges were dropped first of all we probably will
[02:13:14.520 --> 02:13:19.960]  never know all of the details we've heard a lot of information no one was
[02:13:19.960 --> 02:13:27.160]  hurt that is physically killed shot he'd never committed a crime before he
[02:13:27.160 --> 02:13:31.720]  forfeited the bail and it's this kind of situation where they closed the case
[02:13:31.720 --> 02:13:37.840]  all over the country every day I learned this is not unusual a lot of attention
[02:13:37.840 --> 02:13:44.000]  given to it because of who he is he's this extremely talented young man who
[02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:49.120]  people have come to love because of being on television and so I hope I'm
[02:13:49.120 --> 02:13:53.760]  hopeful that he'll go on with his career and that he will be successful he
[02:13:53.760 --> 02:13:57.640]  disappointed not to see him here this evening well I'd love to see him and I'm
[02:13:57.640 --> 02:14:02.080]  looking forward to seeing him and hopefully very soon he goes on in other
[02:14:02.080 --> 02:14:05.120]  interviews that they're all up on the side I can't watch anymore to call him
[02:14:05.120 --> 02:14:13.640]  her son or quote justy small is like a son to me that's the quote now again
[02:14:13.640 --> 02:14:18.960]  40 detectives spent weeks trying to find out who came and dumped all the stuff
[02:14:18.960 --> 02:14:24.920]  on and put a noose around his neck and so if I if I call the police and I say
[02:14:24.920 --> 02:14:29.440]  that my house is on fire and the fire department shows up and then there's a
[02:14:29.440 --> 02:14:34.400]  fire across town and people burn up and die in the house I'm guilty of manslaughter
[02:14:34.400 --> 02:14:38.120]  and if you think in Chicago where you did Democrats run things the highest
[02:14:38.120 --> 02:14:43.080]  crime rate in the nation if you think having 40 detectives spent all their
[02:14:43.080 --> 02:14:47.320]  time trying to do that and if you think making black people think that there's
[02:14:47.320 --> 02:14:51.400]  white folks hiding out in the dark at 2 a.m. in the morning to put nooses around
[02:14:51.400 --> 02:14:56.360]  your necks and then she says nobody was hurt it shows you she thinks he's great
[02:14:56.360 --> 02:15:00.880]  and that's why the head prosecutor let him go it's why they did this because
[02:15:00.880 --> 02:15:04.920]  folks the government thinks it's above the law the Democrats think they're
[02:15:04.920 --> 02:15:09.240]  above the law and we come back we're gonna take your calls on this and more
[02:15:09.240 --> 02:15:14.040]  the latest on Biden the latest on all of it but the big story while we're sitting
[02:15:14.040 --> 02:15:18.560]  there talking about this is the globalist are trying to implode the
[02:15:18.560 --> 02:15:23.680]  economy the Federal Reserve is and they're trying to implode the borders
[02:15:23.680 --> 02:15:29.040]  and our borders as we speak I hate to make the announcement but the country
[02:15:29.040 --> 02:15:33.200]  is taking on water and when you go control your border a nation is in an
[02:15:33.200 --> 02:15:36.840]  existential crisis especially when the people organized to come here have been
[02:15:36.840 --> 02:15:41.080]  organized and brainwashed by the globalist enemy force so I'm gonna say it
[02:15:41.080 --> 02:15:45.040]  Trump is not doing enough on the border I want a real national emergency as
[02:15:45.040 --> 02:15:48.080]  commander-in-chief declared not the one he did but a real national emergency I

[02:20:33.560 --> 02:20:39.280]  I intend to go to your phone calls right now and then Paul Watson takes over in
[02:20:39.280 --> 02:20:47.200]  the fourth hour but at the start of the next segment I'm gonna air a piece one
[02:20:47.200 --> 02:20:51.200]  of our crew members Rob do put together to show the insanity of the border it's
[02:20:51.200 --> 02:20:55.960]  mainly video centric but it'll be okay for radio we are always someone cast on
[02:20:55.960 --> 02:21:01.440]  radio but next segment I've just made a decision in my gut I've been agonizing
[02:21:01.440 --> 02:21:09.280]  over this for months about where I stand on Venezuela and intervention and I
[02:21:09.280 --> 02:21:14.840]  just made the decision with this info wars.com article China since troops to
[02:21:14.840 --> 02:21:19.680]  Venezuela despite US warnings I've made a decision on where I stand and I think
[02:21:19.680 --> 02:21:26.600]  the president who's been very patient with all of this and has been basically
[02:21:26.600 --> 02:21:32.240]  keeping the neocons under control understands the dangers of intervention
[02:21:32.240 --> 02:21:38.840]  but I think the dangers of non-intervening have reached a threshold but
[02:21:38.840 --> 02:21:50.720]  there is a specific three-pronged threat within the president making the right move
[02:21:53.400 --> 02:22:00.840]  that has to be dealt with and I'm just gonna say it I'm gonna be honest with
[02:22:00.840 --> 02:22:05.400]  the audience I don't care what people think my guts never wrong and at 45 I've
[02:22:05.400 --> 02:22:14.800]  learned to go with my gut but of course it's just some of all your research all
[02:22:14.800 --> 02:22:18.160]  your data all the background and your gut does a prime approximation people
[02:22:18.160 --> 02:22:20.960]  call it their gut it's the subconscious brain probably a hundred times more
[02:22:20.960 --> 02:22:26.200]  powerful in the conscious giving you an analysis and saying what has to be done
[02:22:26.200 --> 02:22:35.640]  you know this is so heavy though it's almost like just deciding to do it and
[02:22:35.640 --> 02:22:38.680]  saying it on air it's not good enough to be like a press release I should be an
[02:22:38.680 --> 02:22:42.680]  electric because the government and Trump and others listen and the public
[02:22:42.680 --> 02:22:46.240]  listens to us and this is a big deal though and I don't want to just say
[02:22:46.240 --> 02:22:54.640]  this but it's fresh it's clear and just during the break it hit me and I've
[02:22:54.640 --> 02:22:59.840]  almost done this a couple times in the last few months and I just held back
[02:22:59.840 --> 02:23:04.000]  because I don't trust the neocons around Trump but if he could trust the
[02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:09.720]  people around him we don't just need to have regime change we need to invade
[02:23:09.720 --> 02:23:16.880]  Venezuela right now and I mean invade it full-on invasion 300,000 trips and
[02:23:16.880 --> 02:23:21.000]  people are gonna say oh they'll resist it'll see as an occupation I'm gonna
[02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:26.640]  explain when we come back you can't do this in a vacuum folks we're leaving
[02:23:26.640 --> 02:23:32.160]  vacuums with internet censorship with the chai comms with the Russians now you
[02:23:32.160 --> 02:23:37.360]  can't in this world now just sit here and lie to yourself about the fact that
[02:23:37.360 --> 02:23:41.480]  if we're not there they're going to be there and before we were there to help
[02:23:41.480 --> 02:23:45.960]  them now we're there to help everybody and ourselves and they're collapsing
[02:23:45.960 --> 02:23:51.360]  northern South America into us and so it's a national security issue the UN
[02:23:51.360 --> 02:24:01.600]  isn't gonna stop until we stop them but invading Venezuela and Mexico of need
[02:24:01.600 --> 02:24:06.160]  be and Americans are ready for the real war not these fake wars we want real
[02:24:06.160 --> 02:24:12.600]  wars secure our future and other people's futures you have to get out of the UN you
[02:24:12.600 --> 02:24:16.200]  have to arrest all these people you you can't just launch the war there and then
[02:24:16.200 --> 02:24:19.200]  leave leave the enemy inside the country running operations against us
[02:24:19.200 --> 02:24:22.560]  because the country has reached an existential level of survival at this
[02:24:22.560 --> 02:24:27.040]  point and what do I turn the show off and just run to the Cook Islands or
[02:24:27.040 --> 02:24:32.400]  something because I mean I'm not running so I'm not gonna sit here and lie to you
[02:24:32.400 --> 02:24:37.760]  about where we are the country even either starts fighting or starts dying
[02:24:37.760 --> 02:24:43.600]  folks it just comes down to that and I've done everything I can to stop this
[02:24:43.600 --> 02:24:46.320]  type of stuff it was wrong the Middle Eastern wars were to turn was the
[02:24:46.320 --> 02:24:50.400]  radical Muslims and those were all bad wars this is a survival of the country
[02:24:50.400 --> 02:24:54.120]  at this point and the problem is the neocons like Bay of Pigs will try to set
[02:24:54.120 --> 02:24:59.240]  the president up and sabotage him in the war I get that and that's why I don't
[02:24:59.240 --> 02:25:11.240]  know what to do at that point we are so overrun by damn traders and Machiavelli's
[02:25:11.240 --> 02:25:14.520]  that every time they they do one position then they got to go in other
[02:25:14.520 --> 02:25:18.680]  positions they can keep playing both sides it's like a mental illness instead
[02:25:18.680 --> 02:25:23.400]  of just going straightforward but I can see their moves and they're as crazy as
[02:25:23.400 --> 02:25:27.080]  you know what rat I said I'd go to your calls and I apologize I'm going to him
[02:25:27.080 --> 02:25:31.880]  last second of this hour I'll try to do a firm five-minute break down and go
[02:25:31.880 --> 02:25:36.920]  back to calls about what I believe the president needs to do at this point but I
[02:25:36.920 --> 02:25:49.160]  have looked at the flavor of this and there's no doubt what it is it's what
[02:25:49.160 --> 02:25:57.360]  the chikongs did in the Congo for the Cubans did in the Congo we're so late in
[02:25:57.360 --> 02:26:08.520]  the game folks and they're gonna foam at the complete collapse of South and
[02:26:08.520 --> 02:26:13.480]  Central America into the US and so we're we can't even get enough board patrol to
[02:26:13.480 --> 02:26:16.160]  control the record numbers come across we're being destroyed right now we're
[02:26:16.160 --> 02:26:23.960]  under attack right now and I'm not just gonna sit here and stand by while the
[02:26:23.960 --> 02:26:27.440]  Russians and the chikongs everybody flood into those areas and pretty
[02:26:27.440 --> 02:26:33.000]  stabilize the whole area so the question is does our president is our
[02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:38.640]  military everybody else have what it takes because I'm sick of being pushed
[02:26:38.640 --> 02:26:42.360]  around by these people and these damn leftist traders that run our government
[02:26:42.360 --> 02:26:47.880]  oh let's just get real why are we on the air unless we're really trying to
[02:26:47.880 --> 02:26:51.200]  secure the Republic and have a future instead of playing all these damn games
[02:26:51.200 --> 02:26:55.960]  all day long people like chef and swallow as well and all these little
[02:26:55.960 --> 02:26:59.960]  check-and-neck traders who can be bought off by the next person they have no
[02:26:59.960 --> 02:27:06.000]  morals they have no anything they are enemies period they're the enemy within
[02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:12.320]  I swear on the altar of God though I'm never giving up I'm far from wanting to
[02:27:12.320 --> 02:27:16.320]  give up it's the opposite I am so on fire against you people now makes me
[02:27:16.320 --> 02:27:26.760]  check what you've done to our people all of your crap yeah Ed wants to talk about

[02:33:34.320 --> 02:33:37.960]  taking place look I'm gonna explain something and everybody gets this we're
[02:33:37.960 --> 02:33:42.680]  in World War four right now the CIA accurately called the Cold War World
[02:33:42.680 --> 02:33:47.600]  War three this is the new unconventional warfare economic migrant waves the
[02:33:47.600 --> 02:33:53.880]  UN admits it and a bunch of our elites bet on China sold out to the EU Patriots
[02:33:53.880 --> 02:33:57.680]  and our own intelligence agencies working with the general public didn't
[02:33:57.680 --> 02:34:02.120]  think that was a good idea and put Trump in and now all hell's been breaking
[02:34:02.120 --> 02:34:06.560]  looks like you've been seeing and America's winning but Venezuela has
[02:34:06.560 --> 02:34:14.600]  collapsed northern South America's collapsed Honduras all those areas have
[02:34:14.600 --> 02:34:19.920]  collapsed Guatemala and there are millions coming up now and our courts
[02:34:19.920 --> 02:34:24.160]  and our systems are overwhelmed and if we let a few million in it'll be like
[02:34:24.160 --> 02:34:29.640]  Europe tens of millions and then total break down the Democrats want people
[02:34:29.640 --> 02:34:33.680]  here that are illegal who don't get jobs who are basically homeless to weigh
[02:34:33.680 --> 02:34:37.480]  down the whole society I live in Austin Texas every damn street corners got
[02:34:37.480 --> 02:34:44.960]  homeless sleeping under the bridges it's insane and Trump just met with the head
[02:34:44.960 --> 02:34:51.080]  of NATO to talk about closing the US border as if NATO has any business in
[02:34:51.080 --> 02:34:54.840]  that but all you can do is say to Mexico and everybody because the Mexican
[02:34:54.840 --> 02:34:58.080]  president says he's a socialist come on up in vay we're gonna bring down America
[02:34:58.080 --> 02:35:02.960]  okay it's cut off nobody goes back and forth we're in an emergency I don't want
[02:35:02.960 --> 02:35:10.040]  martial law we're in martial law we've been taken there by the globalists
[02:35:10.040 --> 02:35:13.280]  they're ignoring our laws they're doing whatever they want they're trying to
[02:35:13.280 --> 02:35:16.480]  cause race force the private fellow reserves raising interest rates trying
[02:35:16.480 --> 02:35:23.520]  to kill the economy and the chai comms of the most evil people on earth are
[02:35:23.520 --> 02:35:31.880]  involved and running it and have sent troops into Venezuela to help stage all
[02:35:31.880 --> 02:35:37.000]  this with the UN yeah you laugh at the weatherman 40 years ago bragging about
[02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:40.000]  their plan to use the Chinese to collapse Central and South America into
[02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:44.480]  the US and do all this I was told by all the old-timers this was the plan and I
[02:35:44.480 --> 02:35:47.560]  should sit there with retired colonels and generals and look this was the plan
[02:35:47.560 --> 02:35:51.920]  and roll my eyes because it's unbelievable that we put up with it
[02:35:51.920 --> 02:35:56.920]  didn't it and if we let them start massing Chinese and Russian troops down
[02:35:56.920 --> 02:36:03.720]  there when if we were flooding Russia with millions of refugees and doing that
[02:36:03.720 --> 02:36:06.480]  I'd say it was evil and wrong and we've got troops around Russia and I think
[02:36:06.480 --> 02:36:10.800]  that's pushing it but this isn't that this is Russia and China involved trying
[02:36:10.800 --> 02:36:14.400]  to continue this evil regime that's enslaving people and millions have been
[02:36:14.400 --> 02:36:17.880]  kicked out of their homes five million and they're all coming this way and
[02:36:17.880 --> 02:36:24.200]  they're involved with the globalist and it's an act of war stories up on info
[02:36:24.200 --> 02:36:30.520]  horse.com and his horse.com from zero heads.com and I'm just telling you that we
[02:36:30.520 --> 02:36:35.280]  have an internal enemy that hates this country the AOC and veto supporters and
[02:36:35.280 --> 02:36:39.640]  we're just a damn mess so yeah it's good to have Trump in and we're beating
[02:36:39.640 --> 02:36:44.240]  globalism but this is their counter strike bring down America so what do we
[02:36:44.240 --> 02:36:53.040]  do it's time to take out Maduro but Trump is worried he knows he's got
[02:36:53.040 --> 02:36:56.560]  double crossers in the intelligence agencies that want to make him look bad
[02:36:56.560 --> 02:37:00.640]  so his hands are tied look look just like the sun came up this
[02:37:00.640 --> 02:37:06.800]  morning and it's gonna set this evening at 7 30 or whatever the time is look up
[02:37:06.800 --> 02:37:14.040]  sunset tonight see if I'm right just guessed it 7 32 who knows if Trump
[02:37:14.040 --> 02:37:19.360]  didn't have his hands tied by traders Maduro would be pushing daisies right
[02:37:19.360 --> 02:37:24.760]  now and the people that voted in a good leader would have a chance in the
[02:37:24.760 --> 02:37:29.240]  future that's not the case it's spiraling out of control with a failed
[02:37:29.240 --> 02:37:41.360]  750 it's spiraling out of control right now let me call you right back in a
[02:37:41.360 --> 02:37:45.840]  second thanks important stuff going on so let's go ahead and play a clip of the
[02:37:45.840 --> 02:37:50.080]  president right now president Trump talking about what's happening right
[02:37:50.080 --> 02:37:53.760]  now and the in the national emergency the globalist to put us in not him here
[02:37:53.760 --> 02:37:59.720]  it is and so that's one of the benefits so I'm totally prepared to do it we're
[02:37:59.720 --> 02:38:03.320]  gonna see what happens over the next few days
[02:38:08.760 --> 02:38:12.520]  well they made a big step over the last two days look they are apprehending
[02:38:12.520 --> 02:38:18.920]  people you see how many there are a lot it's a lot of people and the fact that
[02:38:18.920 --> 02:38:22.440]  they're doing that means fewer people are going to come but you know we pay
[02:38:22.440 --> 02:38:28.000]  hundreds of millions of dollars to Honduras and Guatemala and El Salvador
[02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:33.600]  as a combination and what do they do they don't do anything for us they're
[02:38:33.600 --> 02:38:36.560]  supposed to be money well spent I understand the reason for but that
[02:38:36.560 --> 02:38:41.000]  money doesn't get there so we're given hundreds of millions of dollars to these
[02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:45.840]  three countries and the money is not going to where it's supposed to be going
[02:38:45.840 --> 02:38:49.800]  number one number two they're taking advantage of the United States and they
[02:38:49.800 --> 02:38:55.200]  have been for many years so I cut off the payments yesterday I know what the
[02:38:55.200 --> 02:38:59.280]  payments are supposed to be for they're supposed to be to help so that they
[02:38:59.280 --> 02:39:03.120]  don't have this problem but they don't do that the money is gone it's not spent
[02:39:03.120 --> 02:39:08.000]  properly and they arrange I mean thing that bothers me more than anything they
[02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:12.240]  arrange these caravans and they don't put their best people in those caravans
[02:39:12.240 --> 02:39:15.680]  they put people in there that you don't want to have in the United States and
[02:39:15.680 --> 02:39:20.320]  we're not going to have them in the United States it's very simple it's very
[02:39:20.320 --> 02:39:23.000]  very simple
[02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:29.000]  are you happy with the South America leader of nature?
[02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:33.120]  why are you happy with the leader of nature? I think he's been a terrific leader and I can
[02:39:33.120 --> 02:39:37.960]  just say during my time so it's already amazing two and a half years but we got
[02:39:37.960 --> 02:39:42.400]  along really well and he made his first statement about it was we had our first
[02:39:42.400 --> 02:39:46.680]  meeting and I think I got them to put up the other countries respect for the
[02:39:46.680 --> 02:39:55.000]  27 countries put up the other 27 64 billion dollars 64 billion it's a lot of
[02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:59.560]  money and he went out and he said what a great job he did a lot of people don't
[02:39:59.560 --> 02:40:04.000]  like giving credit like the media never gives me credit but he gave me credit now
[02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:06.880]  we're up to way over a hundred billion and it's going to be a lot higher than
[02:40:06.880 --> 02:40:11.200]  that by the end of 2020 but I appreciate the job he's done he's an
[02:40:11.200 --> 02:40:16.480]  excellent job and when it came time to renew because a lot of people wanted that
[02:40:16.480 --> 02:40:19.880]  okay so I'm gonna go back to your phone calls job the reason I'm freaking out is
[02:40:19.880 --> 02:40:28.640]  they're reporting at three of the most high traffic border positions between
[02:40:28.640 --> 02:40:32.800]  Texas and California that they're seeing four or five times any previous
[02:40:32.800 --> 02:40:36.480]  record of people slamming in and it's already overwhelmed the courts and the
[02:40:36.480 --> 02:40:39.960]  detention facilities and they're just loading kids and women and men on the
[02:40:39.960 --> 02:40:43.880]  buses and Democrats are just taking them to hell who knows where a lot of its
[02:40:43.880 --> 02:40:47.280]  child smuggling drug smuggling the Democrats are just a criminal lawless
[02:40:47.280 --> 02:40:51.520]  group of psychotic maggots and our acquiescence to them is allowed this
[02:40:51.520 --> 02:40:56.040]  climate to take place and now as the caller was saying Ed in Colorado all of
[02:40:56.040 --> 02:40:59.320]  the country they're trying to pass laws where the Democrat it doesn't like you
[02:40:59.320 --> 02:41:03.960]  they take your guns away these red flag laws so it's a crazy time Ed what was
[02:41:03.960 --> 02:41:08.880]  your other point well you know my concern has been I just don't understand
[02:41:08.880 --> 02:41:12.720]  why they keep it across the country you know same type of things being turned
[02:41:12.720 --> 02:41:16.400]  yeah because Bloomberg's funding it in Soros and they want to run your life
[02:41:16.400 --> 02:41:21.280]  yeah but you know no one in any of the state is stepping up and saying look you
[02:41:21.280 --> 02:41:25.800]  know we need to actually correct this and we need to we need to change this so
[02:41:25.800 --> 02:41:29.640]  that you can't just be an anonymous caller who you can get your guns taken
[02:41:29.640 --> 02:41:34.680]  away from you and you know it just it's just becoming so frustrating all the
[02:41:34.680 --> 02:41:37.840]  efforts that have been that have been taking place here in Colorado rally for
[02:41:37.840 --> 02:41:40.720]  our right you know people have been reaching out to the legislators trying
[02:41:40.720 --> 02:41:47.000]  to get them to not pass such a such a law that has you know zero protection for
[02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:50.160]  sir we're dealing with tyranny I appreciate your call Ed yeah well the
[02:41:50.160 --> 02:41:53.600]  country's in deep trouble and it's good that we have Trump and he's trying to do
[02:41:53.600 --> 02:41:56.800]  some things but yeah we're in trouble so everybody better get politically
[02:41:56.800 --> 02:42:00.880]  involved and get active now I'm glad you're awake I'm glad you're concerned

[02:42:08.360 --> 02:42:11.600]  answer is standing down at Parkland letting alone a tick that they wouldn't

[02:47:24.680 --> 02:47:28.960]  South of the scales correct
[02:47:54.680 --> 02:48:03.360]  Chief Karish did say today that they have reached over 300,000 apprehensions along the
[02:48:03.360 --> 02:48:07.240]  southwestern border for this fiscal year alone.
[02:48:07.240 --> 02:48:11.160]  Now specifically here in the RGV they have seen over 130,000.
[02:48:11.160 --> 02:48:18.400]  CVP today released that they're expecting to apprehend over 55,000 family units for
[02:48:18.400 --> 02:48:20.720]  the month of March alone.
[02:48:20.720 --> 02:48:27.040]  The fact of the matter is this is not an emergency and the President's fear-mongering doesn't
[02:48:27.040 --> 02:48:28.040]  make it one.
[02:48:28.040 --> 02:48:30.640]  There is no crisis at the border.
[02:48:30.640 --> 02:48:35.880]  All state that this is a manufactured crisis and a crisis that manufactured by the Trump
[02:48:35.880 --> 02:48:36.880]  administration.
[02:48:36.880 --> 02:48:42.680]  But he clearly understands in his gut what stirs his base and he is determined to inflame
[02:48:42.680 --> 02:48:47.560]  these fears regardless of the facts or the effect this will have on the country.
[02:48:47.560 --> 02:48:51.160]  What's at the core of this crisis is the Trump administration.
[02:48:51.160 --> 02:48:56.840]  The reason the Democrats refuse to call this a crisis is because they see it as an opportunity.
[02:48:56.840 --> 02:49:01.920]  CVP is facing an unprecedented humanitarian and border security crisis all along our
[02:49:01.920 --> 02:49:02.920]  southwest border.
[02:49:02.920 --> 02:49:07.400]  The Mexican Interior Secretary said that they're planning to see come through Mexico the mother
[02:49:07.400 --> 02:49:08.400]  of all caravans.
[02:49:08.400 --> 02:49:11.440]  It is a very definite crisis and the question is what do you do?
[02:49:11.440 --> 02:49:21.640]  We will build a wall, we will build a wall, we will build a wall.
[02:49:21.640 --> 02:49:25.280]  Yesterday was April Fool's Day as you know so I guess it was only fitting that Time Magazine
[02:49:25.280 --> 02:49:27.680]  would put a fool on the cover.
[02:49:27.680 --> 02:49:31.960]  They called the phenomenon and said that she's changing the climate fight and this is not
[02:49:31.960 --> 02:49:37.680]  photoshopped and the upper right hand corner is literally the date of April 1st.
[02:49:37.680 --> 02:49:42.360]  I decided to photoshop it a bit to make it more accurate so I changed the phenom to the
[02:49:42.360 --> 02:49:48.160]  moron and posted it on Facebook and Twitter and I wouldn't be surprised if snopes debunked.
[02:49:48.160 --> 02:49:53.320]  With my Republican colleagues they say things and I'm like what does that have to do with
[02:49:53.320 --> 02:49:57.960]  what we're talking about and like the person is like in charge of national flood insurance
[02:49:57.960 --> 02:50:00.320]  program and they're like what?
[02:50:00.320 --> 02:50:08.320]  No one has said yes or no and he says yeah and she goes yes.
[02:50:08.320 --> 02:50:13.840]  And speaking of morons this man Wayne Messam is the Democrat Mayor of Miramar, Florida
[02:50:13.840 --> 02:50:18.760]  and he has just thrown his hat in the presidential ring for 2020.
[02:50:18.760 --> 02:50:23.800]  Not a single American outside of his town has ever heard of or seen this man before and
[02:50:23.800 --> 02:50:28.040]  I'd be willing to bet that three-quarters of the people in his town haven't either but
[02:50:28.040 --> 02:50:31.120]  he thinks he has what it takes to become the president.
[02:50:31.120 --> 02:50:34.840]  Maybe he's got a really big following on social media and I've just never heard of him because
[02:50:34.840 --> 02:50:37.480]  I'm stuck in a conservative echo chamber.
[02:50:37.480 --> 02:50:39.280]  Let's check out his Twitter account shall we?
[02:50:39.280 --> 02:50:42.800]  Oh look at that he's got 5,000 followers.
[02:50:42.800 --> 02:50:48.280]  That's literally fewer followers than the official Kleenex account which has over 27,000
[02:50:48.280 --> 02:50:53.520]  followers showing that more people would rather get updates about the latest tissue technology
[02:50:53.520 --> 02:50:56.040]  than care what this man has to say.
[02:50:56.040 --> 02:51:00.440]  And speaking of tissues I almost cried tears of joy last week when I began getting a flood
[02:51:00.440 --> 02:51:05.320]  of messages from you guys telling me that a great patriot was rocking one of my t-shirts
[02:51:05.320 --> 02:51:09.320]  right behind President Trump and his Grand Rapids Michigan rally.
[02:51:09.320 --> 02:51:12.920]  The placement could have been better there he is right next to the president rocking
[02:51:12.920 --> 02:51:16.120]  my JFK Trump shirt for the entire hour and a half.
[02:51:16.120 --> 02:51:20.200]  I salute you sir and it looks like Fox News did as well because there was a moment during
[02:51:20.200 --> 02:51:22.520]  the applause when they zoomed right in on him.
[02:51:22.520 --> 02:51:27.080]  A lot of people noticed the shirt but not all of them were happy this MSNBC producer
[02:51:27.080 --> 02:51:31.200]  posted a picture of it on Twitter and asked what the fresh hell is this?
[02:51:31.200 --> 02:51:34.640]  This New York Daily News writer got triggered and asked is that dude in the right hand corner
[02:51:34.640 --> 02:51:38.880]  actually wearing a t-shirt depicting JFK and a Trump cap?
[02:51:38.880 --> 02:51:41.720]  Yes yes he is and it's fantastic.
[02:51:41.720 --> 02:51:46.240]  This person reported me to social media hall monitor Brian Stelter tweeting at him asking
[02:51:46.240 --> 02:51:51.600]  him why are these Trump supporters making money off the image of JFK?
[02:51:51.600 --> 02:51:56.120]  This person tattled on me to Congressman Joe Kennedy asking him why are Trump supporters
[02:51:56.120 --> 02:51:57.320]  allowed to do this?
[02:51:57.320 --> 02:51:59.520]  I'm allowed to do it because this is America.
[02:51:59.520 --> 02:52:00.520]  Ain't it great?
[02:52:00.520 --> 02:52:22.280]  I'm your host Alex Jones and the establishment is doing everything they can to shut us down
[02:52:22.280 --> 02:52:29.000]  because they know we represent grassroots populist Americana reboot that swept Trump
[02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:30.760]  into power.
[02:52:30.760 --> 02:52:37.480]  In 2016 if you went to a Trump rally or you went to the RNC event in Cleveland, Ohio
[02:52:37.480 --> 02:52:42.720]  you would see about a third of the people wearing infowars.com shirts and Hillary for
[02:52:42.720 --> 02:52:46.200]  prison shirts from infowars.com.
[02:52:46.200 --> 02:52:50.400]  And I remember when Trump won the nomination and then won the presidency sitting here with
[02:52:50.400 --> 02:52:54.800]  security I had to hire at that point and saying it's really going to get bad now, will they
[02:52:54.800 --> 02:53:01.480]  just kill me or will they try to sue me, lie about me, destroy my name and imprison me?
[02:53:01.480 --> 02:53:06.440]  Because those historically are the different angles that authoritarians take in revenge.
[02:53:06.440 --> 02:53:10.640]  Well we've now seen that they've taken the latter pattern.
[02:53:10.640 --> 02:53:16.800]  So when we talk about this broadcast here, understand that what we're about to cover
[02:53:16.800 --> 02:53:25.640]  is the absolute heart of what we're facing and the only Achilles heel that populist capitalist
[02:53:25.640 --> 02:53:29.680]  nations are dealing with.
[02:53:29.680 --> 02:53:35.800]  And if we can handle this problem, we can handle all the others.
[02:53:35.800 --> 02:53:40.720]  We're not issuing this warning like he did to the companies that wouldn't retract on
[02:53:40.720 --> 02:53:43.760]  the Covington kids just to issue it for no reason.
[02:53:43.760 --> 02:53:49.040]  I don't want to sue Business Insider and their so-called reporter.
[02:53:49.040 --> 02:53:56.040]  I don't want to sue Instagram, but I cannot allow you to silence me and defame me and literally
[02:53:56.040 --> 02:54:02.040]  create a designation that I know is already being used at the inner pole level for conservative
[02:54:02.040 --> 02:54:08.120]  nationalist dissidents that they're preparing to roll out worldwide of hate figure.
[02:54:08.120 --> 02:54:11.760]  Then they take your bank accounts, they take your ability to fly and then they finally
[02:54:11.760 --> 02:54:16.760]  imprison you with this plan and leak documents out of Facebook yesterday.
[02:54:16.760 --> 02:54:17.760]  Show this.
[02:54:17.760 --> 02:54:19.560]  Facebook owns Instagram.
[02:54:19.560 --> 02:54:25.200]  I want you to understand this is the future for you because they leaked these emails, the
[02:54:25.200 --> 02:54:31.400]  Southern Poverty Law Center slash Media Matters types that we know are inside these quote
[02:54:31.400 --> 02:54:38.240]  escalation groups inside of the tech giants, that's what's admittedly was brought in.
[02:54:38.240 --> 02:54:49.040]  They are inside having these conversations via email about how, well, Alex Jones didn't
[02:54:49.040 --> 02:54:56.680]  say anything anti-Semitic and only 4% of the 500 plus comments we reviewed are anti-Semitic.
[02:54:56.680 --> 02:55:00.920]  These are people saying anti-Semitic things to him, but we still want to ban him and so
[02:55:00.920 --> 02:55:09.240]  they say, well, let's just issue him as a hate figure and take him completely off Instagram
[02:55:09.240 --> 02:55:13.560]  and what's left of Facebook because I want to be clear.
[02:55:13.560 --> 02:55:17.120]  I was not completely banned off Facebook or other platforms.
[02:55:17.120 --> 02:55:21.240]  They took channels down saying I'd violated terms of service on those channels.
[02:55:21.240 --> 02:55:27.000]  The media then created the next phase that I was supposedly completely de-platformed
[02:55:27.000 --> 02:55:28.000]  everywhere.
[02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:34.880]  I'm so tired of this classic, Smollett style, Covington kids set up style leftist game.
[02:55:34.880 --> 02:55:38.640]  So this reporter admits that they created the controversy.
[02:55:38.640 --> 02:55:41.360]  They contacted Facebook.
[02:55:41.360 --> 02:55:47.080]  They're working with Facebook insiders that then release the entire group chat discussion
[02:55:47.080 --> 02:55:49.040]  of the moderators.
[02:55:49.040 --> 02:55:54.720]  And then it was put in CNET News, The Washington Post, Alex Jones set to be removed from Instagram
[02:55:54.720 --> 02:55:57.000]  for anti-Semitism post.
[02:55:57.000 --> 02:56:02.960]  And 99% of people will read something like that and think Alex Jones has engaged in some
[02:56:02.960 --> 02:56:03.960]  anti-Semitic statement.
[02:56:03.960 --> 02:56:07.360]  Well, if I did, I'd have that free speech right, but I didn't.
[02:56:07.360 --> 02:56:10.080]  I'm actually pro-Israel being able to exist.
[02:56:10.080 --> 02:56:11.080]  Everybody knows that.
[02:56:11.080 --> 02:56:13.400]  The anti-Semites hate me because of that.
[02:56:13.400 --> 02:56:18.480]  So the magnitude of this to post an article where you're working with the insiders at
[02:56:18.480 --> 02:56:23.320]  Facebook to imply that I've done something anti-Semitic because of a couple of anti-Semitic
[02:56:23.320 --> 02:56:32.720]  comments, and then to say that I am guilty of anti-Semitic posts and never even show
[02:56:32.720 --> 02:56:44.840]  anybody what they're talking about is next level.
[02:56:44.840 --> 02:56:46.080]  Because we need border security.
[02:56:46.080 --> 02:56:47.080]  We have to have it.
[02:56:47.080 --> 02:56:52.080]  It should have happened 30 years ago, 20 years ago, 10 years ago, and it's going to happen
[02:56:52.080 --> 02:56:53.080]  now.
[02:56:53.080 --> 02:56:54.080]  It's going to happen now.
[02:56:54.080 --> 02:56:55.080]  Thank you very much, everybody.
[02:56:55.080 --> 02:56:56.080]  Thanks, guys.
[02:56:56.080 --> 02:56:57.080]  Enjoy your food.
[02:56:57.080 --> 02:57:02.400]  There's the juxtaposed of golden candlestick holders with candles, and then all this fast
[02:57:02.400 --> 02:57:03.400]  food.
[02:57:03.400 --> 02:57:04.400]  It's a...
[02:57:04.400 --> 02:57:05.400]  Trump is ridiculous.
[02:57:05.400 --> 02:57:08.400]  He's the ultimate joker card.
[02:57:08.400 --> 02:57:12.680]  But, meanwhile, he says, we've got burgers stacked the mile high.
[02:57:12.680 --> 02:57:16.520]  They spit it that he's lying when it's a figure of speech.
[02:57:16.520 --> 02:57:21.600]  And I didn't see anybody complaining when Barack Obama was spending $65,000 on hot dog
[02:57:21.600 --> 02:57:23.480]  dinners.
[02:57:23.480 --> 02:57:26.920]  Nobody cared to mention that in the mainstream press or ridicule him.
[02:57:26.920 --> 02:57:30.480]  Obama always made a big deal of going out for fast food, or the press did at least when
[02:57:30.480 --> 02:57:31.480]  he did.
[02:57:31.480 --> 02:57:32.480]  Oh, it's well known.

[02:58:55.440 --> 02:58:57.120]  Don't let life weigh you down.

[03:00:13.320 --> 03:00:22.160]  We are live for the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show on this April 2nd, 2019 edition.
[03:00:22.160 --> 03:00:26.800]  Absolutely shocking video clip that's just come out in the past couple of hours, which
[03:00:26.800 --> 03:00:31.800]  we're going to play here in the next segment, which is CNN host Christiane Amanpour.
[03:00:31.800 --> 03:00:39.160]  In fact, if you go to summit.news right now, it's the top headline over there on summit.news.
[03:00:39.160 --> 03:00:41.360]  We're going to roll this after the break.
[03:00:41.360 --> 03:00:46.560]  He's basically doing an interview with James Comey, former director of the FBI, and suggests
[03:00:46.560 --> 03:00:53.760]  to him that Trump supporters who led the, quote, lock her up chant during the 2016 presidential
[03:00:53.760 --> 03:00:57.960]  campaign should have been locked up themselves.
[03:00:57.960 --> 03:01:05.000]  She actually suggests that Trump supporters chanting lock her up was, quote, hate speech,
[03:01:05.000 --> 03:01:10.280]  and that the federal government, the FBI, should have got involved with, quote, shutting
[03:01:10.280 --> 03:01:17.520]  down Trump supporters who chanted lock her up during the 2016 presidential election.
[03:01:17.520 --> 03:01:22.760]  Absolutely chilling that they're now bringing it to this level, of course, according to
[03:01:22.760 --> 03:01:27.640]  the Supreme Court, hate speech is part of the First Amendment anyway.
[03:01:27.640 --> 03:01:31.120]  Not that this comes anywhere near it.
[03:01:31.120 --> 03:01:33.120]  Absolutely absurd authoritarianism.
[03:01:33.120 --> 03:01:35.560]  But what else could you expect out of CNN?
[03:01:35.560 --> 03:01:40.400]  We're also going to talk about the Joe Biden situation.
[03:01:40.400 --> 03:01:46.080]  Now that his spokesman Bill Russo is blaming, quote, right wing trolls and the dark recesses
[03:01:46.080 --> 03:01:53.800]  of the Internet for this entire scandal, despite the fact that it was the Washington Post,
[03:01:53.800 --> 03:02:00.360]  not right wing trolls who back in 2015 was perhaps the first major news publication to
[03:02:00.360 --> 03:02:08.480]  refer to former Vice President Joe Biden as, quote, creepy uncle Joe and not without evidence
[03:02:08.480 --> 03:02:14.880]  as has been circulating on the Internet for years and years, not as a result of right
[03:02:14.880 --> 03:02:20.160]  wing trolls and their dark recesses, but as a result of the footage itself, which you
[03:02:20.160 --> 03:02:22.160]  see right there.
[03:02:22.160 --> 03:02:25.760]  And people have been asking, how is this impacting Joe Biden in the polls?
[03:02:25.760 --> 03:02:30.600]  Well, we haven't had any polls since this emerged over the weekend.
[03:02:30.600 --> 03:02:34.120]  Those are going to come out later this week, I would imagine.
[03:02:34.120 --> 03:02:39.880]  But if you look at the odds for him becoming the Democratic primary winner, he seems to
[03:02:39.880 --> 03:02:42.680]  have tanked quite significantly.
[03:02:42.680 --> 03:02:47.200]  So this is having a major impact on his potential presidential campaign.
[03:02:47.200 --> 03:02:52.360]  Of course, beforehand, he was the front runner in basically every single poll.
[03:02:52.360 --> 03:02:59.240]  Now as a result of this scandal, his numbers are evaporating fast, which is why you have
[03:02:59.240 --> 03:03:05.720]  the Democratic media industrial complex coming out and defending him at every available turn.
[03:03:05.720 --> 03:03:10.840]  Don't forget, these were the same people who demanded that Donald Trump shouldn't be,
[03:03:10.840 --> 03:03:15.920]  it shouldn't even be allowed to run for president because he said, quote, they let you grab
[03:03:15.920 --> 03:03:17.480]  them by the pussy.
[03:03:17.480 --> 03:03:24.840]  Now, as far as I can see in any of these clips, none of these young women and girls are letting
[03:03:24.840 --> 03:03:26.280]  Joe Biden do anything.
[03:03:26.280 --> 03:03:33.280]  In fact, in numerous instances, they jerk away, they pull away, they're clearly uncomfortable.
[03:03:33.280 --> 03:03:38.360]  So we're going to get into that, we're going to get into another poll, which finds that
[03:03:38.360 --> 03:03:44.120]  the majority of Americans, more Americans than not, think that Hillary Clinton colluded
[03:03:44.120 --> 03:03:49.720]  with foreign operatives during the 2016 presidential election than those who think that Trump
[03:03:49.720 --> 03:03:54.960]  colluded with foreign operatives in the aftermath of the basic collapse of the Mueller report.
[03:03:54.960 --> 03:04:04.720]  Rachel Maddow is still out on NBC every night, again, trying to reinflate this deflated hoax,
[03:04:04.720 --> 03:04:08.480]  even when her own Chiron at the bottom of the screen suggests otherwise, as she talks
[03:04:08.480 --> 03:04:10.360]  about it live on MSNBC.
[03:04:10.360 --> 03:04:15.960]  We're going to talk about the latest with Brexit, obviously, Theresa May, the betrayer
[03:04:15.960 --> 03:04:21.080]  of Britain, has gone for yet another extension to try and kick the can down the road further
[03:04:21.080 --> 03:04:25.120]  in the hopes of canceling Brexit at some point altogether.
[03:04:25.120 --> 03:04:28.280]  We're going to talk about the latest knife crime attacks in London.
[03:04:28.280 --> 03:04:33.640]  There were five separate attacks, they think by the same person over the course of just
[03:04:33.640 --> 03:04:38.400]  a few days in London, going to talk about the response to that.
[03:04:38.400 --> 03:04:43.440]  And we're going to talk about Sweden releasing its first statistics on crime and migration
[03:04:43.440 --> 03:04:44.960]  since 2005.
[03:04:44.960 --> 03:04:46.880]  I wonder what that will contain.
[03:04:46.880 --> 03:05:08.960]  We will be back live with a lot more on the Alex Jones show live, fourth hour, breaking
[03:05:08.960 --> 03:05:09.960]  news, info wars.com.
[03:05:09.960 --> 03:05:10.960]  Don't go away.
[03:05:10.960 --> 03:05:17.400]  They want you to believe you're powerless, but the truth is it is we the people and our
[03:05:17.400 --> 03:05:22.200]  ideas and our actions and what we say and what we do that changes the world.
[03:05:22.200 --> 03:05:24.280]  We are the power structure.
[03:05:24.280 --> 03:05:25.880]  We are the inventors.
[03:05:25.880 --> 03:05:33.200]  We are the trailblazers and the globalists understand that and they understand that they
[03:05:33.200 --> 03:05:38.160]  are basically trying to control and steal the future from we the people.
[03:05:38.160 --> 03:05:42.880]  Now to help fund our operation is undoubtedly the very tip of the spear against these globalists.
[03:05:42.880 --> 03:05:47.120]  I want to encourage listeners and viewers to understand that throughout the second half
[03:05:47.120 --> 03:05:51.000]  of the month of March, we're going to have store wide free shipping and 50% off the
[03:05:51.000 --> 03:06:09.040]  store.com, something everybody should take advantage of live from the info wars.com
[03:06:09.040 --> 03:06:20.480]  We are live and we're going to play that clip with Christian Emma Paul, literally suggesting,
[03:06:20.480 --> 03:06:24.440]  if not outright, saying that Trump supporters should have been locked up for chanting lock
[03:06:24.440 --> 03:06:26.760]  her up during the 2016 presidential election.
[03:06:26.760 --> 03:06:30.000]  First, though, I want to talk about Joe Biden.
[03:06:30.000 --> 03:06:36.040]  We have this top story up on info wars.com Nancy Pelosi tells Joe Biden to stop touching
[03:06:36.040 --> 03:06:37.040]  women.
[03:06:37.040 --> 03:06:42.120]  Of course, you've had a raft of Democrats and leftists over the past few days come out
[03:06:42.120 --> 03:06:44.000]  and defend Joe Biden.
[03:06:44.000 --> 03:06:49.160]  Now at least Pelosi is being honest in recognizing the horrendous optics that this represents
[03:06:49.160 --> 03:06:55.520]  for the Democratic Party in this era of me too, which their own people started back in
[03:06:55.520 --> 03:07:02.440]  2017, even though it later ensnared mostly left wing politicians.
[03:07:02.440 --> 03:07:07.480]  Now Nancy Pelosi has warned Joe Biden to stop touching women during a speech at a breakfast
[03:07:07.480 --> 03:07:10.200]  hour Washington event earlier today.
[03:07:10.200 --> 03:07:14.240]  Of course, Biden has been under intense scrutiny after two women.
[03:07:14.240 --> 03:07:18.720]  That's just over the past few days accused the former vice president of behaving inappropriately
[03:07:18.720 --> 03:07:20.600]  towards them.
[03:07:20.600 --> 03:07:25.480]  Their testimony has, of course, been completely dismissed by most on the left who previously
[03:07:25.480 --> 03:07:29.280]  said over and over again, believe all women.
[03:07:29.280 --> 03:07:33.760]  Pelosi told Biden, quote, join the straight arm club.
[03:07:33.760 --> 03:07:38.880]  In other words, keep your handshakes at arms length and don't be touchy feely.
[03:07:38.880 --> 03:07:42.880]  Just pretend you have a cold and I have a cold, Pelosi said.
[03:07:42.880 --> 03:07:48.560]  Of course, when we talk about this controversy, little reference is given to the most disturbing
[03:07:48.560 --> 03:07:53.880]  aspect of it, which is his behavior towards children, which is documented in that video,
[03:07:53.880 --> 03:08:00.480]  which was according to Biden's campaign manager or his spokesman, at least, was just a fever
[03:08:00.480 --> 03:08:03.600]  brained conspiracy invented by right wing trolls.
[03:08:03.600 --> 03:08:08.160]  Well, the footage kind of speaks for itself, doesn't it?
[03:08:08.160 --> 03:08:15.200]  So Pelosi's come out to her credit and said, look, you need to stop behaving like this.
[03:08:15.200 --> 03:08:17.840]  It wouldn't even have been normal 20 years ago.
[03:08:17.840 --> 03:08:20.320]  Why would it be normal now?
[03:08:20.320 --> 03:08:25.280]  Bill Russo, his spokesman, blamed the dark recesses of the internet for stirring this
[03:08:25.280 --> 03:08:26.280]  up.
[03:08:26.280 --> 03:08:27.440]  Of course, privately, they're saying the opposite.
[03:08:27.440 --> 03:08:32.560]  They're blaming it all on Bernie Sanders people.
[03:08:32.560 --> 03:08:37.920]  Whoopi Goldberg on the view yesterday said, quote, I don't want Joe to stop smelling women's
[03:08:37.920 --> 03:08:39.800]  hair and kissing them.
[03:08:39.800 --> 03:08:45.120]  Yes, she actually said that live on the view that she doesn't want Joe, but maybe she's
[03:08:45.120 --> 03:08:50.560]  a closet Bernie Sanders supporter, because if she thinks that this is normal and acceptable
[03:08:50.560 --> 03:08:56.480]  behavior to whisper to women, to sniff their hair, to grab them around the shoulders, even
[03:08:56.480 --> 03:09:03.440]  as they're visibly uncomfortable with that, then either she's completely stupid in terms
[03:09:03.440 --> 03:09:08.320]  of not understanding the optics of the situation or she's a closet Bernie Sanders supporter.
[03:09:08.320 --> 03:09:12.920]  And once Joe Biden's candidacy to be sunk, but she did actually say yesterday on the
[03:09:12.920 --> 03:09:17.920]  view, I don't want Joe to stop when they were talking about the context of him smelling
[03:09:17.920 --> 03:09:23.840]  women's hair and kissing them while Biden and his staff will continue to blame the potential
[03:09:23.840 --> 03:09:28.560]  presidential candidates, creepy behavior around women and young girls on internet trolls.
[03:09:28.560 --> 03:09:30.840]  The footage speaks for itself.
[03:09:30.840 --> 03:09:37.200]  Mika Brzezinski on MSNBC defends Joe Biden's habit of an inappropriate touching.
[03:09:37.200 --> 03:09:42.880]  This article is up on summit.news MSNBC's Mika Brzezinski defended Joe Biden's
[03:09:42.880 --> 03:09:45.440]  creepy behavior around women and children earlier today.
[03:09:45.440 --> 03:09:50.280]  Of course, she was one of the loudest and most vocal in denouncing President Donald
[03:09:50.280 --> 03:09:56.800]  Trump for how he said he behaved around women, even with consent.
[03:09:56.800 --> 03:10:00.760]  Now she's defending Biden as well over the weekend, Lucy Flores accused the potential
[03:10:00.760 --> 03:10:04.560]  presidential candidate of gripping us shoulders and kissing her head several years ago at
[03:10:04.560 --> 03:10:10.640]  a political event, adding that this made her feel uneasy, gross and confused.
[03:10:10.640 --> 03:10:15.760]  And of course, he was hit by a second accusation yesterday, which was a Connecticut woman who
[03:10:15.760 --> 03:10:21.400]  said Biden touched her inappropriately and rubbed noses with her during a 2009 political
[03:10:21.400 --> 03:10:24.800]  fundraiser in Greenwich when he was vice president.
[03:10:24.800 --> 03:10:29.960]  I mean, even, even those weird elongated hugs with Hillary Clinton, I mean, if there's
[03:10:29.960 --> 03:10:33.600]  anyone you wouldn't want to do that with, it would be Hillary Clinton in my view, but
[03:10:33.600 --> 03:10:36.240]  even he can't resist Hillary Clinton.
[03:10:36.240 --> 03:10:40.440]  That's how touchy-feely he really is.
[03:10:40.440 --> 03:10:46.320]  Brzezinski said, quote, he is extremely affectionate, extremely flirtatious in a completely safe
[03:10:46.320 --> 03:10:47.320]  way.
[03:10:47.320 --> 03:10:49.720]  Okay, would you allow him around your kids?
[03:10:49.720 --> 03:10:53.920]  Do you think that's a completely safe way to behave around kids?
[03:10:53.920 --> 03:10:59.920]  When these women in all of these, or at least half of these photos and these videos are
[03:10:59.920 --> 03:11:02.800]  clearly uncomfortable with what he's doing to them.
[03:11:02.800 --> 03:11:06.680]  So it's clearly not completely safe and normal, is it?
[03:11:06.680 --> 03:11:11.480]  Brzezinski later suggested that Flores was seeking to politically sink Biden because
[03:11:11.480 --> 03:11:13.360]  she is a Bernie supporter.
[03:11:13.360 --> 03:11:16.680]  So they're blaming it on right-wing trolls, but also saying, oh, by the way, it's a secret
[03:11:16.680 --> 03:11:17.680]  Bernie conspiracy.
[03:11:17.680 --> 03:11:24.040]  There you see, he's weird elongated, grope and grab of Hillary Clinton.
[03:11:24.040 --> 03:11:28.520]  She said, are we allowed to bring up that Lucy Flores is a huge Bernie person?
[03:11:28.520 --> 03:11:32.520]  She has political connections that might be counter to Biden's goals and that this could
[03:11:32.520 --> 03:11:37.600]  be politically motivated, of course, no one asked whether it was politically motivated
[03:11:37.600 --> 03:11:41.880]  that the Billy Bush tape leaked, just what was it a month before the election?
[03:11:41.880 --> 03:11:44.960]  No, that wasn't a consideration, was it?
[03:11:44.960 --> 03:11:51.640]  So either Brzezinski hasn't seen the footage of Biden's creepy behavior, and again, they
[03:11:51.640 --> 03:11:57.080]  present the scandal as it being him grabbing women around the shoulders from behind.
[03:11:57.080 --> 03:11:58.280]  That's not the worst of it.
[03:11:58.280 --> 03:12:04.120]  That is not the worst of it, as anyone who has watched this footage at length knows particularly
[03:12:04.120 --> 03:12:10.480]  in the video that I put out, Creepy Uncle Joe, which since Kellyanne Conway went on
[03:12:10.480 --> 03:12:15.760]  Fox News over the weekend and said Google Creepy Uncle Joe just by coincidence, this
[03:12:15.760 --> 03:12:21.520]  video has gone at about 300,000 more views since the weekend.
[03:12:21.520 --> 03:12:27.000]  Now it's got over 2 million views, even as they claim it's part of a Bernie Sanders
[03:12:27.000 --> 03:12:33.720]  conspiracy, despite the fact that it was the Washington Post, as I said before, that first
[03:12:33.720 --> 03:12:40.040]  labeled Biden Creepy Uncle Joe back in 2015 and said if he has any aspirations of running
[03:12:40.040 --> 03:12:43.560]  for president, this could potentially sink his candidacy.
[03:12:43.560 --> 03:12:49.280]  He hasn't announced yet, and according to the polls, it's having a big effect, or at
[03:12:49.280 --> 03:12:52.080]  least according to the odds.
[03:12:52.080 --> 03:12:58.600]  This headline is up on infowars.com, Joe Biden's primary victory odds slump after Me Too controversy,
[03:12:58.600 --> 03:13:03.200]  having previously been the clear front runner, and he has been for months, as you know, Biden's
[03:13:03.200 --> 03:13:07.400]  primary victory odds have slumped following controversy over his inappropriate behavior
[03:13:07.400 --> 03:13:10.040]  around women.
[03:13:10.040 --> 03:13:16.280]  Now if you look at the predicted chart, which is right there in this article, you will know
[03:13:16.280 --> 03:13:22.120]  that since these new revelations come out with the two women accusing him, Biden, who
[03:13:22.120 --> 03:13:29.920]  is represented there by the pink line on that graph, sunk as of 28th of March, 29th of March
[03:13:29.920 --> 03:13:35.480]  is when he really dropped down, which is the day when the first claim was made, I believe,
[03:13:35.480 --> 03:13:38.040]  and since then he hasn't recovered.
[03:13:38.040 --> 03:13:44.160]  So both Kamala Harris and Bernie Sanders have risen above Bernie Sanders according to the
[03:13:44.160 --> 03:13:49.280]  odds, whether that's going to be reflected in polls of Democratic voters, we won't know
[03:13:49.280 --> 03:13:51.720]  for a few days or so.
[03:13:51.720 --> 03:13:59.040]  The UK outlet, Odds Checker, which kind of amalgamates all the different betting odds
[03:13:59.040 --> 03:14:05.240]  for UK political betting, of course, I believe it's illegal to bet on US politics from the
[03:14:05.240 --> 03:14:10.960]  US, but you can do it from the UK via these Odds Checker type websites.
[03:14:10.960 --> 03:14:16.160]  We've got him below Sanders and Harris, and they've actually got Beto O'Rourke level
[03:14:16.160 --> 03:14:21.280]  pegging now with Joe Biden at six to one to win the Democratic candidacy, and in fact,
[03:14:21.280 --> 03:14:28.200]  if you look at the odds to win the presidency itself, according to that spread, Biden is
[03:14:28.200 --> 03:14:32.560]  not even in the top four, and in fact Beto O'Rourke has now surpassed him.
[03:14:32.560 --> 03:14:36.480]  So this is having a huge damaging effect.
[03:14:36.480 --> 03:14:40.280]  Of course, you've got all these people coming out and defending him, but it's really not
[03:14:40.280 --> 03:14:46.320]  doing him much help according to what we're seeing through the political betting odds.
[03:14:46.320 --> 03:14:52.680]  Zero hedge reports, Biden advisers believe rival Democrats conspired to revive inappropriate
[03:14:52.680 --> 03:14:53.680]  touching allegations.
[03:14:53.680 --> 03:14:58.760]  Now, of course, whether they conspired or not to revive them, the fact is they've always
[03:14:58.760 --> 03:15:03.960]  been there, and this was always going to be a scandal that would drag Biden down, whether
[03:15:03.960 --> 03:15:10.240]  it would have occurred now or later on during the actual presidential campaign itself.
[03:15:10.240 --> 03:15:15.480]  So now they're saying that they know Flora's association and public support for Sanders
[03:15:15.480 --> 03:15:21.160]  sources from within Biden's campaign told Axios that the allegations of Biden's inappropriate
[03:15:21.160 --> 03:15:24.800]  behavior are being fanned by his rivals.
[03:15:24.800 --> 03:15:28.720]  And yeah, out the other side of their mouth, they're saying that it's all the work of right-wing
[03:15:28.720 --> 03:15:32.500]  trolls and the dark recesses of the internet.
[03:15:32.500 --> 03:15:36.440]  So they really can't make their mind that the fact is Joe Biden has a huge problem optically
[03:15:36.440 --> 03:15:41.840]  with his behavior around women, whether you believe that's actually predatory in nature
[03:15:41.840 --> 03:15:42.840]  or not.
[03:15:42.840 --> 03:15:48.560]  The fact is this looks absolutely disastrous in this era of Me Too, which the left themselves
[03:15:48.560 --> 03:15:49.560]  created.
[03:15:49.560 --> 03:15:50.560]  We'll be back.
[03:15:50.560 --> 03:15:51.560]  It's the Alex Jones Show Live in 4Wars.com.

[03:15:54.620 --> 03:15:58.560]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:15:58.560 --> 03:16:00.080]  I sued the IRS in one.
[03:16:00.080 --> 03:16:03.040]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:16:03.040 --> 03:16:06.360]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[03:16:06.360 --> 03:16:08.560]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.

[03:16:28.400 --> 03:16:29.400]  the world.
[03:16:29.400 --> 03:16:32.400]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[03:16:32.400 --> 03:16:38.360]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[03:16:38.360 --> 03:16:42.160]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[03:16:42.160 --> 03:16:43.160]  Was there ever a vote?
[03:16:43.160 --> 03:16:44.720]  Who do we fight for?
[03:16:44.720 --> 03:16:51.280]  The deep state began with World War I, the United States of Empire, by James Dunne, available

[03:20:52.080 --> 03:20:53.240]  concentration.

[03:20:55.800 --> 03:21:00.800]  You probably should only be taking half a sachet of this to begin with, but it's great.
[03:21:00.800 --> 03:21:07.120]  You just mix it in with water or the drink of your choice for quick, accessible energy.
[03:21:07.120 --> 03:21:08.120]  It is TurboForce.

[03:21:34.200 --> 03:21:37.960]  With the Autoship, you get another 10% off.
[03:21:37.960 --> 03:21:45.280]  The reviews are absolutely amazing, again, 4.8 out of 5 in terms of reviews.
[03:21:45.280 --> 03:21:47.640]  I'm just reading some of them right now.
[03:21:47.640 --> 03:21:51.400]  I'm already a fan of BrainForce Plus, but this takes it to a whole new level.
[03:21:51.400 --> 03:21:56.480]  I used to drink two Monster Rehab teas a day with BrainForce and have switched to one TurboForce
[03:21:56.480 --> 03:22:01.520]  in the morning to BrainForce Plus pills in the afternoon, and they're saying that they
[03:22:01.520 --> 03:22:07.360]  don't get, again, that junky side effect that you get from a lot of energy drinks.
[03:22:07.360 --> 03:22:11.680]  Another one says, holy mother of God, this product does not fail, started taking it in
[03:22:11.680 --> 03:22:12.680]  the morning.
[03:22:12.680 --> 03:22:19.200]  The results, I was bouncing off the walls, I had to ask my wife to help me out, and that's
[03:22:19.200 --> 03:22:20.200]  no hyperbola.
[03:22:20.200 --> 03:22:24.040]  I mean, this is powerful stuff.
[03:22:24.040 --> 03:22:26.040]  It's worth every penny, says another reviewer.
[03:22:26.040 --> 03:22:29.160]  Again, these are all verified independent reviewers.
[03:22:29.160 --> 03:22:34.000]  I take half a pack in, have natural energy feeling that lasts for nine to 10 hours.
[03:22:34.000 --> 03:22:37.240]  Being active in my community meetings at City Hall can last for hours.
[03:22:37.240 --> 03:22:42.360]  TurboForce helps me to stay alert and respond to issues that pertinent to myself and my
[03:22:42.360 --> 03:22:43.360]  neighbors.
[03:22:43.360 --> 03:22:48.360]  Again, just an absolute raft of five-star reviews for TurboForce, and it's available

[03:23:00.200 --> 03:23:05.000]  We've got the two different flavors there, again, a perfect combination to take with

[03:23:12.440 --> 03:23:16.480]  bar available right now at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:23:16.480 --> 03:23:23.680]  Now, Christian Amonpour, who is a close friend of Hillary Clinton, every time I see her on
[03:23:23.680 --> 03:23:29.560]  CNN, she's basically running her mouth as a mouthpiece for globalist agendas.
[03:23:29.560 --> 03:23:34.800]  She's done numerous softball interviews with Hillary Clinton, and now she's done one with
[03:23:34.800 --> 03:23:37.440]  former FBI director James Comey.
[03:23:37.440 --> 03:23:43.200]  But this was fascinating and disturbing, not for anything that Comey said, but for what
[03:23:43.200 --> 03:23:46.040]  Christian Amonpour herself said.
[03:23:46.040 --> 03:23:47.040]  Let's roll the clip.
[03:23:47.040 --> 03:23:48.040]  Good.
[03:23:48.040 --> 03:23:53.320]  I've got one question, because you just said, lock her up, or lock me up.
[03:23:53.320 --> 03:23:57.800]  Of course, lock her up was a feature of the 2016 Trump campaign.
[03:23:57.800 --> 03:24:03.360]  Do you, in retrospect, wish that people like yourself, the head of the FBI, I mean the
[03:24:03.360 --> 03:24:08.480]  people in charge of law and order, had shut down that language, that it was dangerous
[03:24:08.480 --> 03:24:13.960]  potentially, that it could have created violence, that it's kind of hate speech?
[03:24:13.960 --> 03:24:16.560]  Should that have been allowed?
[03:24:16.560 --> 03:24:18.360]  That's not a role for government to play.
[03:24:18.360 --> 03:24:22.880]  The beauty of this country is people can say what they want, even if it's misleading, and
[03:24:22.880 --> 03:24:23.880]  it's demagoguery.
[03:24:23.880 --> 03:24:29.240]  The people who should have shut it down were Republicans who understand the rule of law
[03:24:29.240 --> 03:24:34.280]  and the values that they claim to stand for, shame on them, but it wasn't a role for government
[03:24:34.280 --> 03:24:35.280]  to play.
[03:24:35.280 --> 03:24:37.440]  James Comey, former FBI director.
[03:24:37.440 --> 03:24:39.880]  Now, did you catch that?
[03:24:39.880 --> 03:24:45.360]  She literally just said that people should have been locked up themselves for chanting
[03:24:45.360 --> 03:24:46.640]  lock her up.
[03:24:46.640 --> 03:24:52.860]  That chanting lock her up about Hillary Clinton would potentially have caused violence.
[03:24:52.860 --> 03:24:55.360]  Absolutely absurd ludicrous statement.
[03:24:55.360 --> 03:24:59.960]  She invoked the, she said the FBI should have done something to shut it down.
[03:24:59.960 --> 03:25:06.160]  Like the FBI doesn't have anything better to do than deal with Trump supporters jovially
[03:25:06.160 --> 03:25:11.800]  having a laugh at Trump campaign events, chanting lock her up about Hillary Clinton.
[03:25:11.800 --> 03:25:14.960]  Like how on earth is that going to cause violence?
[03:25:14.960 --> 03:25:16.240]  Absolutely ludicrous.
[03:25:16.240 --> 03:25:20.560]  She also doesn't understand the basic tenets of the First Amendment and the fact that the
[03:25:20.560 --> 03:25:26.240]  Supreme Court itself said that hate speech was part of the First Amendment as long as
[03:25:26.240 --> 03:25:28.720]  it's not an imminent incitement to violence.
[03:25:28.720 --> 03:25:33.360]  Of course, chanting lock her up does not even approach hate speech.
[03:25:33.360 --> 03:25:35.800]  These are the kind of people who are working for CNN.
[03:25:35.800 --> 03:25:41.840]  These are the same people who said, who suggested, who was it Cuomo, that people reading the
[03:25:41.840 --> 03:25:47.840]  WikiLeaks documents, the pedestrian emails that were publicly available online was the
[03:25:47.840 --> 03:25:52.080]  criminal act and that only CNN should be able to read them.
[03:25:52.080 --> 03:25:54.680]  This is what we're dealing with with CNN.
[03:25:54.680 --> 03:26:01.680]  Literally calling for Trump supporters to be arrested by the federal government for chanting
[03:26:01.680 --> 03:26:07.760]  a completely, in comparison to many chants, anodyne slogan, lock her up.
[03:26:07.760 --> 03:26:12.920]  Meanwhile, we had actual Democrats Hillary Clinton supporters literally rioting after
[03:26:12.920 --> 03:26:13.920]  she lost.
[03:26:13.920 --> 03:26:18.120]  CNN and poor didn't have a lot to say about that because she's close friends with Hillary
[03:26:18.120 --> 03:26:19.120]  Clinton.
[03:26:19.120 --> 03:26:21.920]  She's one of the premier globalists at CNN.
[03:26:21.920 --> 03:26:29.280]  She's given Clinton numerous softball interviews before and now her bias has been brutally exposed.
[03:26:29.280 --> 03:26:34.920]  As I say in the article, which is at summit.news, this kind of ghoulish authoritarian rhetoric
[03:26:34.920 --> 03:26:39.000]  wouldn't look out of place in an actual dictatorship.
[03:26:39.000 --> 03:26:45.240]  This is the kind of thing that anti-Urdogan protesters at an event in Turkey would be
[03:26:45.240 --> 03:26:49.560]  locked up and tortured for, for chanting, lock him up.
[03:26:49.560 --> 03:26:55.680]  And now CNN House Christian Amanpour wants to see something similar in the United States.
[03:26:55.680 --> 03:27:00.840]  Absolutely chilling, chilling, disturbing rhetoric.
[03:27:00.840 --> 03:27:05.760]  Now we have this story up on infowars.com, poll more Americans think Hillary colluded
[03:27:05.760 --> 03:27:12.320]  with foreign operatives than Trump, much to the chagrin of Christian Amanpour, no doubt.
[03:27:12.320 --> 03:27:16.040]  Following the failure of the Mueller investigation to find any evidence that Trump or members
[03:27:16.040 --> 03:27:20.240]  of his campaign colluded with Russia, new Rasmussen poll finds that more Americans now
[03:27:20.240 --> 03:27:23.800]  think Hillary Clinton colluded with foreign operatives than Trump.
[03:27:23.800 --> 03:27:29.280]  And of course, many of them say that because they claim that the notorious steel dossier
[03:27:29.280 --> 03:27:33.520]  itself was an example of foreign collusion.
[03:27:33.520 --> 03:27:39.160]  I mean, one, it was completely bogus, but two, it was obtained via the help of Russian
[03:27:39.160 --> 03:27:40.160]  officials.
[03:27:40.160 --> 03:27:43.160]  So if there's any Russian collusion, there it is.
[03:27:43.160 --> 03:27:48.120]  Of course, they only have the Uranium-1 controversy where the Clinton Foundation got kickbacks
[03:27:48.120 --> 03:27:56.240]  for basically selling out the United States' control over uranium to Russia.
[03:27:56.240 --> 03:27:59.240]  So you have that as an actual example of foreign collusion.
[03:27:59.240 --> 03:28:05.520]  And now Rasmussen poll finds that 47% of likely U.S. voters think Clinton's 2016 presidential
[03:28:05.520 --> 03:28:12.000]  campaign is more likely than President Trump's to have illegally colluded with foreign operatives.
[03:28:12.000 --> 03:28:15.400]  45% still suspect the Trump campaign.
[03:28:15.400 --> 03:28:21.240]  So more Americans suspect Hillary of colluding with the Russians than Trump.
[03:28:21.240 --> 03:28:27.320]  Also a different poll by Rasmussen has found that Trump, as of yesterday, had a 51% approval
[03:28:27.320 --> 03:28:34.820]  rating that compares to just 45% for Barack Obama at the same point in his presidency.
[03:28:34.820 --> 03:28:40.520]  So despite the 95% negative media coverage, President Donald Trump is six points ahead
[03:28:40.520 --> 03:28:44.240]  of where Barack Obama was at the same point for him.
[03:28:44.240 --> 03:28:46.240]  Back in 2011, we'll be back with more news.
[03:28:46.240 --> 03:28:48.240]  This is the Alex Jones Show Live, Infowars.com.
[03:28:48.240 --> 03:28:49.240]  Don't go away.
[03:28:49.240 --> 03:29:16.760]  Let's see a dream.
[03:29:16.760 --> 03:29:38.820]  Well, it's a dream.
[03:29:38.820 --> 03:29:56.820]  We all know the importance of fish oils.
[03:29:56.820 --> 03:30:00.920]  While we are sure to provide them for ourselves, it's just as important to make sure your kids
[03:30:00.920 --> 03:30:03.340]  get their EPA and DHA too.
[03:30:03.340 --> 03:30:07.820]  Honor Roll is a powerful DHA fish oil formula for your child.

[03:30:53.820 --> 03:30:56.060]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[03:30:56.060 --> 03:30:57.060]  Go ahead.
[03:30:57.060 --> 03:30:58.820]  I just have to say something, man.
[03:30:58.820 --> 03:31:02.740]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[03:31:02.740 --> 03:31:03.740]  It just gets old, man.
[03:31:03.740 --> 03:31:06.700]  I'm going to shut you down right now, okay?
[03:31:06.700 --> 03:31:08.980]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[03:31:08.980 --> 03:31:13.500]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[03:31:13.500 --> 03:31:15.580]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[03:31:15.580 --> 03:31:18.660]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[03:31:18.660 --> 03:31:20.340]  I mean, what's it going to take?
[03:31:20.340 --> 03:31:21.420]  Us being shut down?
[03:31:21.420 --> 03:31:22.420]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[03:31:22.420 --> 03:31:23.420]  Yeah, you know what?
[03:31:23.420 --> 03:31:24.420]  I'll take it.
[03:31:24.420 --> 03:31:25.420]  I'll put it on pause again.
[03:31:25.420 --> 03:31:26.420]  Hey, Frank!
[03:31:26.420 --> 03:31:30.900]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack,
[03:31:30.900 --> 03:31:31.900]  we need your help?
[03:31:31.900 --> 03:31:36.180]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[03:31:36.180 --> 03:31:39.260]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[03:31:39.260 --> 03:31:40.260]  Do you understand?
[03:31:40.260 --> 03:31:41.420]  I need your help, Frank!
[03:31:41.420 --> 03:31:43.700]  I need your help, Frank!
[03:31:43.700 --> 03:31:49.340]  Go to infowarstore.com right now and help fund the Info War.
[03:31:49.340 --> 03:31:50.340]  Do you understand?
[03:31:50.340 --> 03:31:51.700]  I need your help, Frank!
[03:31:51.700 --> 03:31:54.020]  Free press needs your help, Frank!
[03:31:54.020 --> 03:31:57.820]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[03:31:57.820 --> 03:32:00.620]  The real drama can be found here in Lelani Estates.
[03:32:00.620 --> 03:32:05.220]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about
[03:32:05.220 --> 03:32:07.820]  ash and acid rain.
[03:32:07.820 --> 03:32:13.220]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water
[03:32:13.220 --> 03:32:14.740]  to unhealthy levels.
[03:32:14.740 --> 03:32:21.260]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity and pH.
[03:32:21.260 --> 03:32:25.260]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity
[03:32:25.260 --> 03:32:26.660]  in the rainwater.
[03:32:26.660 --> 03:32:31.940]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy
[03:32:31.940 --> 03:32:38.020]  metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:32:38.020 --> 03:32:43.660]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water, so what we've
[03:32:43.660 --> 03:32:48.980]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:32:48.980 --> 03:32:57.460]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:32:57.460 --> 03:33:26.820]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:33:26.820 --> 03:33:32.300]  Now despite the almost complete collapse of the Russian collusion conspiracy, which was
[03:33:32.300 --> 03:33:39.500]  this generation's WMD, Rachel Maddow is still over on MSNBC, even as her ratings sink day
[03:33:39.500 --> 03:33:41.060]  by day.
[03:33:41.060 --> 03:33:46.340]  Talking about Russian collusion like it isn't a giant wild conspiracy theory, headline
[03:33:46.340 --> 03:33:53.020]  up on biz pack review, Rachel Maddow corrected in real time by MSNBC's own Chiron as she
[03:33:53.020 --> 03:33:58.820]  pushes Mueller conspiracy, MSNBC's Rachel Maddow continued to push her blatant conspiracy
[03:33:58.820 --> 03:34:03.740]  claims about Robert Mueller's report, even while her own network fact checked her on
[03:34:03.740 --> 03:34:04.740]  the air.
[03:34:04.740 --> 03:34:10.260]  Maddow fan the flames of fake news Monday as she raised the alarm over her suspicions
[03:34:10.260 --> 03:34:15.860]  that Attorney General William Barr is secretly redacting the special counsel's report before
[03:34:15.860 --> 03:34:17.420]  its public release.
[03:34:17.420 --> 03:34:24.940]  Meanwhile, in the MSNBC production room, the network's last truth teller, is that really
[03:34:24.940 --> 03:34:29.700]  what she calls herself, was apparently oblivious to the on-air rant and offered an on-screen
[03:34:29.700 --> 03:34:37.060]  Chiron that completely contradicted the show's host, of course, pointing out that Mueller
[03:34:37.060 --> 03:34:42.180]  is working with Barr to select what gets redacted in the report.
[03:34:42.180 --> 03:34:46.780]  So it's not Barr who gets the choice on his own, he's working with the special counsel
[03:34:46.780 --> 03:34:48.860]  to make those decisions.
[03:34:48.860 --> 03:34:54.980]  Aaron Marta responded to this on Twitter, and it wasn't an April Fool's day joke, quite
[03:34:54.980 --> 03:34:55.980]  surprisingly.
[03:34:55.980 --> 03:34:59.980]  He said, tip for Maddow, if you're going to keep misleading your audience, make sure
[03:34:59.980 --> 03:35:03.220]  your producers aren't correcting you in real time.
[03:35:03.220 --> 03:35:08.820]  Here the Chiron accurately states Friday's news, Mueller is assisting Barr with redactions.
[03:35:08.820 --> 03:35:13.660]  Meanwhile, Maddow is falsely claiming the exact opposite.
[03:35:13.660 --> 03:35:18.940]  Everybody else said on Twitter, the Chiron writer must be the last truth teller at MSNBC
[03:35:18.940 --> 03:35:21.660]  probably being transferred to sales.
[03:35:21.660 --> 03:35:26.700]  So even as her own colleagues on-air, her own editors correct her, she still continues
[03:35:26.700 --> 03:35:30.780]  to spout this fake Russian collusion conspiracy theory.
[03:35:30.780 --> 03:35:37.420]  Meanwhile, and this is up on Summit.News, if you go over to the left-hand side, it's
[03:35:37.420 --> 03:35:40.460]  there on trending number four.
[03:35:40.460 --> 03:35:42.940]  Now this is a computer generated video.
[03:35:42.940 --> 03:35:44.700]  People are on Twitter saying, this is fake.
[03:35:44.700 --> 03:35:45.700]  This is not real.
[03:35:45.700 --> 03:35:46.700]  No, it's not real.
[03:35:46.700 --> 03:35:48.140]  It's computer generated.
[03:35:48.140 --> 03:35:50.100]  What was interesting was the reaction to it.
[03:35:50.100 --> 03:35:57.580]  The headline is this, terrifying Amazon drone delivery blimp looks like alien invasion.
[03:35:57.580 --> 03:36:01.660]  Somebody did a computer generated mock-up, and it was very professionally done, by the
[03:36:01.660 --> 03:36:06.620]  way, of what Amazon's drone delivery service would look like.
[03:36:06.620 --> 03:36:10.940]  According to Twitter users who responded to this video, it was, quote, terrifying and
[03:36:10.940 --> 03:36:14.020]  looked like an alien invasion.
[03:36:14.020 --> 03:36:18.900]  If you go to that article, the video is there, you can scroll down and play the video.
[03:36:18.900 --> 03:36:21.260]  This is a computer generated simulation.
[03:36:21.260 --> 03:36:26.140]  The little drones come out of the Amazon blimp and fly off to the little individual houses
[03:36:26.140 --> 03:36:28.260]  to make their deliveries.
[03:36:28.260 --> 03:36:31.300]  But this is not science fiction.
[03:36:31.300 --> 03:36:40.780]  Amazon has already patented a floating distribution warehouse exactly as depicted in the clip.
[03:36:40.780 --> 03:36:46.540]  When this was reported on by Silicon Republic, Amazon patents floating warehouses to cater
[03:36:46.540 --> 03:36:52.300]  for drone delivery, and they write that airships may have gone out of fashion with the rapid
[03:36:52.300 --> 03:36:56.940]  growth of fixed-wing aircraft, but it seems the blimp could soon return for an entirely
[03:36:56.940 --> 03:36:58.700]  different purpose.
[03:36:58.700 --> 03:37:03.020]  According to the Mercury News, Amazon has patented product distribution warehouses that
[03:37:03.020 --> 03:37:07.660]  could be flown in the sky while being attached to a series of blimps.
[03:37:07.660 --> 03:37:12.940]  So as far back as 2017, in fact, probably before that, they had already patented this
[03:37:12.940 --> 03:37:18.820]  exact technology that you see there in the clip, which is now causing people to absolutely
[03:37:18.820 --> 03:37:25.020]  freak out and panic as to the potential other uses of such technology.
[03:37:25.020 --> 03:37:28.620]  Now, let's talk about what's happening in San Francisco.
[03:37:28.620 --> 03:37:33.380]  In fact, there was a big video, I think it was put out by a news station called KOMX,
[03:37:33.380 --> 03:37:40.140]  something like that, in Seattle, and they entitled this one-hour investigation, Seattle
[03:37:40.140 --> 03:37:47.620]  is dying, quite the headline, but it was put out by a mainstream affiliate news organization.
[03:37:47.620 --> 03:37:53.940]  It's going viral on YouTube, but they have the same problems, obviously, as San Francisco.
[03:37:53.940 --> 03:37:59.180]  San Francisco has more drug addicts than kids in high school at this point, because the
[03:37:59.180 --> 03:38:05.620]  government is handing out 5.8 million needles a year, those needles litter the streets, the
[03:38:05.620 --> 03:38:12.020]  feces litter the streets, the homeless people are just in 10 cities all over the place at
[03:38:12.020 --> 03:38:13.020]  this point.
[03:38:13.020 --> 03:38:19.140]  San Francisco is dying, Seattle is dying, according to that news station's one-hour investigation.
[03:38:19.140 --> 03:38:24.500]  And now we have this headline, up on infowars.com, wealthy San Francisco liberals fight homeless
[03:38:24.500 --> 03:38:27.420]  shelter being built near their mansions.
[03:38:27.420 --> 03:38:31.940]  A wealthy liberal neighborhood in San Francisco, whose residents cast the most votes for Hillary
[03:38:31.940 --> 03:38:38.620]  Clinton in 2016, is fighting against a proposal to build a new homeless shelter near their
[03:38:38.620 --> 03:38:39.620]  gated mansions.
[03:38:39.620 --> 03:38:45.060]  And in fact, obviously, you knew that this would be wealthy liberals, it's in San Francisco,
[03:38:45.060 --> 03:38:51.300]  but one of the areas directly targeted for this go fund me, which has raised $80,000,
[03:38:51.300 --> 03:38:58.060]  as of yesterday, has probably reached its $100,000 target by now, to fight against the construction
[03:38:58.060 --> 03:39:01.900]  of a new homeless shelter near their gated mansions.
[03:39:01.900 --> 03:39:07.820]  One of the areas directly targeted for this go fund me campaign is Mission Bay.
[03:39:07.820 --> 03:39:14.620]  Now, I looked up the voting record of Mission Bay, San Francisco, and it was the most pro-Hillary
[03:39:14.620 --> 03:39:18.500]  neighborhood in the entire city of San Francisco.
[03:39:18.500 --> 03:39:25.620]  They voted 1,680 votes for Clinton Kane, out of 1,893 ballots cast.
[03:39:25.620 --> 03:39:32.060]  There's basically over 95% of people in this area voted for Hillary Clinton, and they're
[03:39:32.060 --> 03:39:37.420]  the same kind of people who will get up on Twitter all day and virtue signal about how
[03:39:37.420 --> 03:39:41.860]  much they care for the homeless, how much they care for minorities, how much they care
[03:39:41.860 --> 03:39:47.940]  for the poor, when it actually comes down to advocating for those interests in actually
[03:39:47.940 --> 03:39:52.340]  backing it up and living that lifestyle by accepting the fact that you will have homeless
[03:39:52.340 --> 03:39:58.220]  shelters nearby if you move into those areas and make the rent skyrocket, make the house
[03:39:58.220 --> 03:39:59.220]  prices skyrocket.
[03:39:59.220 --> 03:40:05.420]  Now, when it comes down to it, they will actively campaign against homeless shelters.
[03:40:05.420 --> 03:40:10.700]  The resident who started the go fund me is from South Beach, another area that heavily
[03:40:10.700 --> 03:40:13.100]  voted for Hillary Clinton.
[03:40:13.100 --> 03:40:19.020]  And the go fund me page stated concerns over public safety, drug use, and other problems
[03:40:19.020 --> 03:40:24.460]  that a large shelter may bring to the community, adding that a third of homeless are drug users
[03:40:24.460 --> 03:40:26.220]  and some are sex offenders.
[03:40:26.220 --> 03:40:30.100]  So again, they're all for the poor, they're all for the homeless, as long as they keep
[03:40:30.100 --> 03:40:33.140]  them well away from where they live.
[03:40:33.140 --> 03:40:35.700]  This is the same with mass migration.
[03:40:35.700 --> 03:40:41.100]  In every single European country, you look at where the most vehemently pro-mass migration
[03:40:41.100 --> 03:40:47.620]  politicians live, and it's always in the whitest areas with the least migrants.
[03:40:47.620 --> 03:40:53.660]  Same goes for here in London, where you get celebrities, people like Gary Linux, who preach
[03:40:53.660 --> 03:40:58.300]  on Twitter all day about how much they care for refugees and migrants.
[03:40:58.300 --> 03:41:02.860]  And they live in the whitest areas of London possible.
[03:41:02.860 --> 03:41:08.300]  And given how diverse London is right now, there aren't that many of those areas left,
[03:41:08.300 --> 03:41:12.820]  but yet they still choose to live in them while virtue signaling on Twitter about how
[03:41:12.820 --> 03:41:18.580]  evil and racist people are for wanting controlled, reasonable, sensible immigration policies.
[03:41:18.580 --> 03:41:23.740]  As ever with these hypocrites, it's do as I say, not as I do.
[03:41:23.740 --> 03:41:29.580]  So now there's this huge campaign in San Francisco to stop this homeless shelter from being built,
[03:41:29.580 --> 03:41:34.620]  citing worries about crime and sanitation, and in fact, it's just a stone's throw from
[03:41:34.620 --> 03:41:38.660]  Google's San Francisco offices and GAP's headquarters.
[03:41:38.660 --> 03:41:43.060]  But when it comes down to it, these wealthy liberals, when they put their money where
[03:41:43.060 --> 03:41:46.180]  their mouth is, it's against the homeless.
[03:41:46.180 --> 03:41:52.620]  And in fact, there were two CEOs of two big corporations, both massive liberals, of course,
[03:41:52.620 --> 03:41:56.620]  who donate tens of thousands of dollars to this.
[03:41:56.620 --> 03:42:01.580]  And you have a situation in San Francisco where it's basically a progressive utopia
[03:42:01.580 --> 03:42:06.260]  where they hand out 5.8 million needles a year despite the fact they've got a massive
[03:42:06.260 --> 03:42:08.740]  drug addict homeless population.
[03:42:08.740 --> 03:42:13.940]  It's exacerbating it, it's making it worse.
[03:42:13.940 --> 03:42:14.940]  Many of them live on the streets.
[03:42:14.940 --> 03:42:17.460]  It now stands at 24,500.
[03:42:17.460 --> 03:42:21.900]  That is the homeless population, the junkie population, I correct myself, the junkie population
[03:42:21.900 --> 03:42:31.100]  of San Francisco, 24,500, an increase of 2,000 drug users since 2012 and 8,500 more people
[03:42:31.100 --> 03:42:34.220]  than the city's 16,000 high school students.
[03:42:34.220 --> 03:42:39.780]  So they've got 8,500 more junkies than people than kids actually going to high school.
[03:42:39.780 --> 03:42:42.220]  We'll continue in that vein after the break.
[03:42:42.220 --> 03:42:47.140]  In terms of poorer conservatives being more generous than hypocritical wealthy liberals
[03:42:47.140 --> 03:42:51.220]  who will virtue signal about it all day on Twitter when it comes down to their own lives,
[03:42:51.220 --> 03:42:52.620]  they want nothing to do with it.
[03:42:52.620 --> 03:42:53.620]  We'll be back.
[03:42:53.620 --> 03:42:58.500]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship.
[03:42:58.500 --> 03:43:03.820]  And I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most
[03:43:03.820 --> 03:43:07.020]  buried, the most suppressed.
[03:43:07.020 --> 03:43:13.700]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant, leftist
[03:43:13.700 --> 03:43:19.340]  authoritarians like the young turds and others get so butt hurt when Trump won.
[03:43:19.340 --> 03:43:21.260]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[03:43:21.260 --> 03:43:24.500]  They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[03:43:24.500 --> 03:43:29.700]  And that's why the globalist Hillary and others are trying to shut InfoWars down.
[03:43:29.700 --> 03:43:34.780]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech, about taking your very
[03:43:34.780 --> 03:43:36.200]  sovereignty away.
[03:43:36.200 --> 03:43:38.500]  This country is in a war.
[03:43:38.500 --> 03:43:42.300]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't
[03:43:42.300 --> 03:43:45.420]  spread the articles and videos, and if you don't financially get the great products we
[03:43:45.420 --> 03:43:50.180]  have and fund us, and the 360 win, we're dead in the water, I'm in your hands, you're in
[03:43:50.180 --> 03:43:51.180]  my hands.
[03:43:51.180 --> 03:44:03.940]  That's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsTour.com with InfoWars Select.
[03:44:03.940 --> 03:44:09.580]  It's the full spectrum of my patriot supply on the top, most respected companies out there.
[03:44:09.580 --> 03:44:15.220]  But because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their
[03:44:15.220 --> 03:44:17.300]  other distributors aren't able to do.

[03:44:39.660 --> 03:44:42.220]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[03:44:42.220 --> 03:44:47.220]  You're buying war bonds, bringing great products, and together with God's help, we are unstoppable.

[03:44:54.340 --> 03:44:58.700]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or
[03:44:58.700 --> 03:45:02.940]  to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[03:45:02.940 --> 03:45:07.100]  Believe me, I know I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright
[03:45:07.100 --> 03:45:13.180]  lights every day, but thanks to Supermail Vitality at InfoWarsTour.com, I still have
[03:45:13.180 --> 03:45:14.180]  that energy.
[03:45:14.180 --> 03:45:18.380]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against
[03:45:18.380 --> 03:45:22.540]  the chemicals and the food and water, to fight back against the modern-day lifestyle with
[03:45:22.540 --> 03:45:27.540]  the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy
[03:45:27.540 --> 03:45:34.780]  and drive, to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[03:45:34.780 --> 03:45:38.780]  So go to InfoWarsTour.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.
[03:45:38.780 --> 03:45:42.460]  This is actually our last run of Supermail Vitality.

[03:46:17.780 --> 03:46:22.100]  that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side
[03:46:22.100 --> 03:46:23.100]  effects.

[03:48:16.100 --> 03:48:21.100]  Now finishing up from what I was talking about in the last segment, you have a group of people
[03:48:21.100 --> 03:48:26.860]  in San Francisco in wealthy liberal areas who are campaigning against the construction
[03:48:26.860 --> 03:48:32.180]  of a new homeless shelter near their gated mansions because again, it's do as I say,
[03:48:32.180 --> 03:48:36.260]  not do as I do, they will get up on Twitter and virtue signal all day about how much they
[03:48:36.260 --> 03:48:40.860]  love the poor, minorities, homeless, how much they want to help drug addicts.
[03:48:40.860 --> 03:48:46.060]  When it comes down to it, they want to keep them as far away from them as possible.
[03:48:46.060 --> 03:48:51.500]  And on that point, we have this article which I'll bring up time and time again when anything
[03:48:51.500 --> 03:48:52.940]  like this is in the news.
[03:48:52.940 --> 03:48:57.860]  Of course, we had a video out of Sweden a couple of weeks ago, one of the most pro-refugee
[03:48:57.860 --> 03:49:02.420]  countries in the world where they go up to Swedes on the streets of Stockholm, stick
[03:49:02.420 --> 03:49:08.100]  a microphone in their face and say, do you support personally housing refugees and migrants?
[03:49:08.100 --> 03:49:12.060]  Not just bringing them into the country, but personally housing them.
[03:49:12.060 --> 03:49:16.420]  Every single one of the respondents on the street said, yes, I support personally housing
[03:49:16.420 --> 03:49:18.020]  refugees and migrants.
[03:49:18.020 --> 03:49:25.020]  So then they bring in a quote refugee into the picture and they say, this guy needs a
[03:49:25.020 --> 03:49:26.180]  room for tonight.
[03:49:26.180 --> 03:49:27.820]  Can he go home with you?
[03:49:27.820 --> 03:49:30.140]  And suddenly they changed their minds.
[03:49:30.140 --> 03:49:34.340]  And again, this brings me back to this article which was out of RT a couple of years back
[03:49:34.340 --> 03:49:37.140]  now, but it's more pertinent than ever.
[03:49:37.140 --> 03:49:42.360]  poorer conservatives, more generous than wealthy liberals, according to a study, less well
[03:49:42.360 --> 03:49:47.300]  off families from red states donate relatively higher in growing proportion of their money
[03:49:47.300 --> 03:49:51.940]  to charity, while those at the top have been given a smaller share as their income has
[03:49:51.940 --> 03:49:55.420]  increased a new extensive study has revealed.
[03:49:55.420 --> 03:49:58.660]  The study noted that while the amount of charitable giving by the US as a nation has
[03:49:58.660 --> 03:50:05.860]  remained steady at around 3%, the poorer people are the greater amount they spend on charity.
[03:50:05.860 --> 03:50:11.900]  And when they broke that down into a red and blue states, they found that poorer conservatives
[03:50:11.900 --> 03:50:14.860]  were more likely to give them wealthier liberals.
[03:50:14.860 --> 03:50:21.380]  So again, when it comes down to it, in general, conservatives are not retweeting charities
[03:50:21.380 --> 03:50:23.500]  and that's their good deed for the day.
[03:50:23.500 --> 03:50:28.780]  They're actually giving their money to charities because again, you have this idea that conservatives
[03:50:28.780 --> 03:50:33.060]  are mean and nasty and they hate the poor, they hate the needy when when it comes down
[03:50:33.060 --> 03:50:37.980]  to it, they actually help the poor and needy more than wealthy liberals do even though
[03:50:37.980 --> 03:50:40.220]  they have less money.
[03:50:40.220 --> 03:50:45.140]  And again, that is coming to fruition with the situation in San Francisco where the liberal
[03:50:45.140 --> 03:50:49.900]  groups including in the area which voted the most for Hillary Clinton out of the entire
[03:50:49.900 --> 03:50:55.040]  country, or at least the entire city of San Francisco is fighting against this homeless
[03:50:55.040 --> 03:51:01.540]  shelter being built near their gate at mansions, do as I say, not as I do.
[03:51:01.540 --> 03:51:06.540]  Going on though, Tommy Robinson, who has been completely de-platformed over the past couple
[03:51:06.540 --> 03:51:11.620]  of months from Instagram, from Facebook, of course, last year, he was de-platformed from
[03:51:11.620 --> 03:51:12.620]  Twitter.
[03:51:12.620 --> 03:51:14.300]  No, that's not enough.
[03:51:14.300 --> 03:51:17.060]  Now he's basically being blacked out on YouTube.
[03:51:17.060 --> 03:51:22.900]  His channel is still on YouTube, but they've done the age old tactic of putting everything
[03:51:22.900 --> 03:51:28.100]  he does behind this blockade wall, where you have to be signed into a YouTube account to
[03:51:28.100 --> 03:51:33.140]  see it where there are no likes, there are no comments, there are no view counts, basically
[03:51:33.140 --> 03:51:38.140]  strangling anyone getting through to his channel to an even greater degree.
[03:51:38.140 --> 03:51:43.380]  Tommy blackout, British MPs forced YouTube to ban Tommy Robinson from streaming live.
[03:51:43.380 --> 03:51:47.180]  Of course, his live streams are probably the most popular thing he does on that channel.
[03:51:47.180 --> 03:51:53.220]  And of course, this was after Tom Watson, the number two at the Labour Party, who given
[03:51:53.220 --> 03:51:58.420]  Jeremy Corbyn's record is basically stands a pretty good chance of being the next Prime
[03:51:58.420 --> 03:52:03.980]  Minister, the next leader of Britain, sending a letter to YouTube and these other companies
[03:52:03.980 --> 03:52:09.060]  which did de-platform Tommy Robinson, demanding that he be de-platformed from YouTube.
[03:52:09.060 --> 03:52:11.700]  And to a large extent, that has happened.
[03:52:11.700 --> 03:52:15.660]  British MPs have forced YouTube to restrict right-wing activist Tommy Robinson from live
[03:52:15.660 --> 03:52:20.020]  streaming to his more than 300,000 followers on the video sharing site.
[03:52:20.020 --> 03:52:23.660]  Youtubers placed several restrictions on Robinson's YouTube account that will greatly reduce his
[03:52:23.660 --> 03:52:26.020]  ability to reach a wide audience.
[03:52:26.020 --> 03:52:31.660]  Now if you search Tommy Robinson on YouTube, just as they did with Alex Jones, and I think
[03:52:31.660 --> 03:52:36.780]  they initially backtracked that, but later on they put it back in place, all you will
[03:52:36.780 --> 03:52:39.260]  get now is hit pieces about Tommy Robinson.
[03:52:39.260 --> 03:52:44.340]  If that's not already in place, that's going to be in place over the next few days.
[03:52:44.340 --> 03:52:45.980]  And there you see it right there.
[03:52:45.980 --> 03:52:52.660]  BBC News Night, The Guardian, left-wing publications, there's One Fox News, which is the only slightly
[03:52:52.660 --> 03:52:58.380]  sympathetic one you would think, Channel 4 News, another left-wing outlet, again, it's
[03:52:58.380 --> 03:53:01.620]  all negative when you Google Tommy Robinson.
[03:53:01.620 --> 03:53:06.460]  So it's about de-platforming people, it's about withdrawing the ability of those people
[03:53:06.460 --> 03:53:08.700]  to defend themselves.
[03:53:08.700 --> 03:53:13.460]  And if they think that all of Tommy Robinson's supporters, thousands of whom were out in
[03:53:13.460 --> 03:53:20.220]  force in Whitehall, central London, near Parliament, just this last Friday, do they
[03:53:20.220 --> 03:53:24.300]  really think those people are just going to go away and not be frustrated?
[03:53:24.300 --> 03:53:30.580]  In fact, many people have made the point, if you de-platform less extreme people, their
[03:53:30.580 --> 03:53:33.660]  supporters only end up becoming more extreme.
[03:53:33.660 --> 03:53:39.500]  So it has the very opposite effect of what these people think will happen by de-platforming.
[03:53:39.500 --> 03:53:44.700]  They're now basically YouTube of hidden Tommy Robinson, they've taken the coward's way out.
[03:53:44.700 --> 03:53:50.260]  Instead of completely de-platforming him, they've just hidden all his content behind
[03:53:50.260 --> 03:53:51.540]  this wall.
[03:53:51.540 --> 03:53:54.700]  You have to sign in, you can't search his name, when you search his name, it's just
[03:53:54.700 --> 03:53:57.180]  hit piece after hit piece.
[03:53:57.180 --> 03:54:01.660]  Basically exactly what they did to Alex Jones, they've now done to Tommy Robinson.
[03:54:01.660 --> 03:54:07.820]  Meanwhile, in France, former French President Warns Macron's battle with Yellow Vest will
[03:54:07.820 --> 03:54:08.820]  end badly.
[03:54:08.820 --> 03:54:12.860]  This is former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who's one of the current fight between President
[03:54:12.860 --> 03:54:17.260]  Emmanuel Macron and the Gilles Jaune Yellow Vest movement will end badly.
[03:54:17.260 --> 03:54:21.780]  You've seen the footage, we had more footage yesterday, the Yellow Vest protests continue
[03:54:21.780 --> 03:54:26.140]  to happen in Paris, all these are the major French cities, weekend after weekend.
[03:54:26.140 --> 03:54:32.100]  The media's barely reporting on it anymore, and the police brutality seems to be getting
[03:54:32.100 --> 03:54:33.540]  worse and worse.
[03:54:33.540 --> 03:54:38.980]  We had videos yesterday of somebody washing their face in a public fountain.
[03:54:38.980 --> 03:54:44.420]  The riot police turn up and basically just drag him to the floor, all he's doing is washing
[03:54:44.420 --> 03:54:45.420]  his face.
[03:54:45.420 --> 03:54:49.140]  There's another video, a guy merely wearing a Yellow Vest, doesn't even look like he's
[03:54:49.140 --> 03:54:52.020]  protesting, he's just walking down an alleyway.
[03:54:52.020 --> 03:54:57.340]  The police run up, crack him around the head with a bat on, he begins bleeding profusely.
[03:54:57.340 --> 03:55:02.980]  This is still happening in France weekend after weekend, and yet the media coverage
[03:55:02.980 --> 03:55:05.420]  of it has decreased to an alarming degree.
[03:55:05.420 --> 03:55:08.940]  They think that just by ignoring it, it's not going to go away.
[03:55:08.940 --> 03:55:13.020]  It's not going to go away, those people are going to be out on the streets weekend after
[03:55:13.020 --> 03:55:14.020]  weekend.
[03:55:14.020 --> 03:55:20.860]  Meanwhile, on the streets of London, we had another quadruple stabbing over the weekend,
[03:55:20.860 --> 03:55:24.340]  and in fact, someone else was stabbed today in one area of London, they're saying this
[03:55:24.340 --> 03:55:28.220]  is probably the same person, it's mental health issues.
[03:55:28.220 --> 03:55:32.380]  We have five more people stabbed in the same area of London.
[03:55:32.380 --> 03:55:37.780]  Now Breitbart reports, PM's U-turns on stop and search follows bloody weekend in London.
[03:55:37.780 --> 03:55:41.900]  They see the reports of the recent stabbings in Edmonton.
[03:55:41.900 --> 03:55:47.060]  So basically the Prime Minister, Theresa May, along with Sadiq Khan, or it was Theresa May
[03:55:47.060 --> 03:55:54.260]  initially, withdrew the stop and search powers of the police because they said it was racist
[03:55:54.260 --> 03:55:57.900]  because it indiscriminately targeted black people.
[03:55:57.900 --> 03:56:02.180]  Now if you look at the actual statistics of who's behind this knife crime, and it's contained
[03:56:02.180 --> 03:56:07.300]  in this report, statistics reported in the evening standard, which is the mainstream
[03:56:07.300 --> 03:56:13.700]  leftist newspaper in London, show that 73% of offenders and 53% of victims of knife crime
[03:56:13.700 --> 03:56:17.220]  were of a black or minority ethnic background.
[03:56:17.220 --> 03:56:23.460]  So you have 73% of the perpetrators of this knife crime, and I think the stats would be
[03:56:23.460 --> 03:56:29.780]  similar for acid attacks being of a black or minority ethnic background, yet the police
[03:56:29.780 --> 03:56:35.860]  before now did not have the powers or were convinced against using those powers against
[03:56:35.860 --> 03:56:42.140]  black and minority ethnic background individuals because it was racist.
[03:56:42.140 --> 03:56:44.220]  That was what the left presented it as.
[03:56:44.220 --> 03:56:47.260]  That's why those powers got rolled back in the first place.
[03:56:47.260 --> 03:56:50.100]  Then you had stabbing surge across London.
[03:56:50.100 --> 03:56:51.700]  People talk about London all the time.
[03:56:51.700 --> 03:56:53.860]  It's actually worse in other areas of the UK.
[03:56:53.860 --> 03:56:59.300]  You've had areas of the UK like Kent, for example, where stabbings have shot up by almost
[03:56:59.300 --> 03:57:02.780]  200% in one year alone.
[03:57:02.780 --> 03:57:06.620]  So when people talk about London being the new crime capital worse than New York, it's
[03:57:06.620 --> 03:57:11.420]  actually even worse in other areas of the UK.
[03:57:11.420 --> 03:57:16.540]  And now finally, they're getting those stop and search powers back into place where the
[03:57:16.540 --> 03:57:23.140]  police have the ability to use section 60 orders to target the likely perpetrators of
[03:57:23.140 --> 03:57:29.980]  knife crime, who in 73% of cases in London at least were a black or minority ethnic background
[03:57:29.980 --> 03:57:35.300]  before they weren't allowed to do so because the left screamed all day that it was racist.
[03:57:35.300 --> 03:57:37.700]  Again, political correctness harms.
[03:57:37.700 --> 03:57:42.180]  That's going to do it for the AXIOM show, fourth hour coming up, war room with Owen Shroyer.
[03:57:42.180 --> 03:57:43.180]  Don't go away.
[03:57:43.180 --> 03:57:44.180]  We'll be back.
[03:57:44.180 --> 03:57:59.020]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best selling supplement family in the world is
[03:57:59.020 --> 03:58:04.740]  energy drinks and energy supplements, but they are riddled with dyes and toxins and
[03:58:04.740 --> 03:58:09.220]  synthetic caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in
[03:58:09.220 --> 03:58:11.660]  just a few hours and have terrible side effects.

[03:58:21.140 --> 03:58:23.540]  There's nothing else like it, you must experience it.
[03:58:23.540 --> 03:58:28.100]  It is a total game changer and it comes in easy to use, packaged, mixed in with fruit
[03:58:28.100 --> 03:58:30.580]  juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[03:58:30.580 --> 03:58:34.420]  Warning though, it's very, very strong, it lasts 10 hours, so take a half packet the
[03:58:34.420 --> 03:58:38.220]  first time you take it because Turbo Force is named Turbo Force because it will take
[03:58:38.220 --> 03:58:40.220]  you into overdrive.
[03:58:40.220 --> 03:58:44.260]  Turbo Force at inforcelive.com.
[03:58:44.260 --> 03:58:48.540]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[03:58:48.540 --> 03:58:52.540]  Info Wars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with
[03:58:52.540 --> 03:58:55.540]  every faucet, shower and sink in your home.
