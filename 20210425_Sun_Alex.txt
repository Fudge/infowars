[00:00.000 --> 00:09.440]  It's Sunday, April 25th, the year is 2021, Alex Jones here on the special broadcast.
[00:09.440 --> 00:13.040]  Ellen Stroyer is about to be taking over for the remainder of the transmission, but I
[00:13.040 --> 00:17.360]  wanted just to up front thank the listeners and all of our affiliates and the crew, the
[00:17.360 --> 00:23.000]  sponsors and everybody else for your support and your prayers because as negative as things
[00:23.000 --> 00:29.480]  are and as bad as things have been, we've got a lot of data showing us now that the
[00:29.480 --> 00:34.200]  great reset is backfired on the globalist and their attempt to forcibly inoculate the
[00:34.200 --> 00:36.440]  planet has blown up in their face.
[00:36.440 --> 00:42.280]  Yes, the United States is the most vaccinated with this poison in the world.
[00:42.280 --> 00:48.200]  Next to the UK, we're over 15%, but now it's stopping dead in its tracks because so many
[00:48.200 --> 00:49.800]  people are literally dropping dead.
[00:49.800 --> 00:54.520]  They're also getting giant herpes like infections all over their bodies.
[00:54.520 --> 00:58.760]  Women are becoming sterile, women are growing tumors inside their uteruses.
[00:58.760 --> 01:03.920]  And again, this is all negative and sad, but they tried to stampede people and a lot of
[01:03.920 --> 01:10.000]  folks held back and waited and when they saw such massive carnage, it triggered a huge
[01:10.000 --> 01:11.000]  awakening.
[01:11.000 --> 01:15.000]  And I'm not just seeing it with the data, I'm seeing it on the street.
[01:15.000 --> 01:19.800]  A lot of people that were saying I was full of it are apologizing, so there is a lot of
[01:19.800 --> 01:22.720]  really spectacular developments happening.
[01:22.720 --> 01:23.720]  It's very, very sad.
[01:23.720 --> 01:29.680]  There's a very famous actor in India, the article is on him, FullWars.com.
[01:29.680 --> 01:33.960]  He went on national TV and took the shot and said everybody should take it, it's totally
[01:33.960 --> 01:34.960]  safe.
[01:34.960 --> 01:37.880]  And that's the Indian government shot, they banned the Pfizer shot.
[01:37.880 --> 01:41.040]  He died of a massive heart attack the next day.
[01:41.040 --> 01:46.240]  Well these type of vaccines cause inflammation in the brain and in the arteries.
[01:46.240 --> 01:52.120]  And if you already have close to blocked arteries in your heart, you're going to die, folks.
[01:52.120 --> 01:57.520]  That's in the main line literature, like don't give a pregnant woman any type of vaccine,
[01:57.520 --> 02:00.680]  much less an mRNA.
[02:00.680 --> 02:05.360]  So the globalists made their run at us, they did this as a test to see what we put up with.
[02:05.360 --> 02:08.440]  The lockdown was very successful up front.
[02:08.440 --> 02:13.760]  The fraud of the six feet space and all of that garbage worked for a while.
[02:13.760 --> 02:16.560]  And it shows that leftists all over the planet have really bought a foot line and sinker,
[02:16.560 --> 02:20.400]  we're far from out of the woods, but Mark Twain said a lie goes half way around the
[02:20.400 --> 02:23.440]  world before he puts his pants on.
[02:23.440 --> 02:29.200]  That has happened yet again because at first they had the jump on us, they had the hysteria,
[02:29.200 --> 02:34.560]  they had the fear, they had the chai kong, a propaganda, but now it's starting to backfire
[02:34.560 --> 02:39.680]  on them and so at first they had us in full collapse to their will and now opposition
[02:39.680 --> 02:44.480]  formed and now it's reversing very, very, very quickly, but it's more important than
[02:44.480 --> 02:49.600]  ever that we drive the point home now, that we don't wear the mask, that we talk to everybody,
[02:49.600 --> 02:53.880]  that we know, that we say no, that we say take the mask off our children particularly,
[02:53.880 --> 02:58.600]  it's abusive, it's causing track runners to collapse, have their lungs collapsed, it's
[02:58.600 --> 03:03.200]  causing children to get bacterial pneumonia and it's very important we get on the offense
[03:03.200 --> 03:08.040]  with these governors and people, not just the Santas, but people like the Texas Governor
[03:08.040 --> 03:12.720]  Abbott to come out and say we were hoaxed, to come out and say we were scammed because
[03:12.720 --> 03:19.400]  now the propaganda organ of the globalist CNN saying, okay, the finish line is almost
[03:19.400 --> 03:24.120]  here, well I guess we'll go ahead and back off this and that's because they want to
[03:24.120 --> 03:28.720]  be the ones that declare the world open again right before they clamp it back down with
[03:28.720 --> 03:33.960]  a new virus, which you better believe is coming, so we have to get on the total offense, exposed
[03:33.960 --> 03:39.280]  into the criminals, exposed in the Wuhan lab, exposing Fauci, Bill Gates as the scammers,
[03:39.280 --> 03:43.720]  owning part of the vaccine companies, having conflicts of interest, we have to remind everybody
[03:43.720 --> 03:46.720]  that these vaccines were never approved around the world and have been banned all over the
[03:46.720 --> 03:52.960]  world, think of that victory, all the vaccines have been banned in different countries, some
[03:52.960 --> 03:57.320]  in different countries, but some of the vaccines have been completely banned in Europe, completely
[03:57.320 --> 04:02.440]  banned in Australia, completely banned in areas of Africa and Latin America, the U.S. is the
[04:02.440 --> 04:06.160]  dumping ground for every poison that's out there because again we're the main target
[04:06.160 --> 04:10.960]  of this, so we have to keep exposing the great reset agenda, we have to expose only their
[04:10.960 --> 04:17.120]  first big salvo, but as the battle begins into the future, this is going very, very good
[04:17.120 --> 04:21.080]  compared to what the globalists wanted, they are in deep trouble.
[04:21.080 --> 04:25.720]  Their program is in freefall, their line is in freefall, it was never approved, it was
[04:25.720 --> 04:30.240]  never authorized, it was a giant genetic engineering testing, they couldn't get these things approved
[04:30.240 --> 04:35.000]  before, so they did this giant hoax to shove it on us and thanks to Info Wars and thanks
[04:35.000 --> 04:39.480]  to you and thanks to God above, we are going to win this fight, so Owen Schroder is coming
[04:39.480 --> 04:43.720]  up live today, but as negative as stuff is, this is very, very positive, now let's expose
[04:43.720 --> 04:47.720]  the whole race war hoax, divide and conquer, and the open border strategy, they're pushing
[04:47.720 --> 04:51.960]  as well and we can win this thing because Biden just announced an 800-fold increase
[04:51.960 --> 04:55.480]  of illegal aliens coming to the United States, so that's the next big fight to expose, secure
[04:55.480 --> 05:01.400]  our borders, secure the republic, expose the great reset, replacement migration program.
[05:01.400 --> 05:06.680]  I 1 trillion percent believe what I'm saying, hell, everybody knows that, I just tell you
[05:06.680 --> 05:10.160]  what I really think, people say, Jones, why the hell did you just say that on air, that's
[05:10.160 --> 05:14.040]  embarrassing, well, I'm not going to stop with only the good stuff about me, but I'll
[05:14.040 --> 05:18.960]  tell you this right now, you're nuts if you don't get storeable food, and I've got the
[05:18.960 --> 05:23.160]  biggest best sponsor with the highest quality food and the lowest price you're going to
[05:23.160 --> 05:27.560]  find, can you spend triple or four times it and get like gourmet stuff that tastes even
[05:27.560 --> 05:31.920]  better, yeah, most of this stuff tastes amazing, some of it tastes okay, the point is it's
[05:31.920 --> 05:36.080]  high quality, it's nutritious, and it lasts a long time, and compared to other competitors
[05:36.080 --> 05:40.920]  that they can't even get close, we've got three months, six month year supplies right
[05:40.920 --> 05:45.920]  now, and I've twisted their arms so hard to give you 10 percent off again, because you're
[05:45.920 --> 05:55.360]  so conditionally bound or super sale, we're doing it one more time, infowarstore.com, infowarstore.com,
[05:55.360 --> 06:14.640]  10 percent off the entire catalog of my favorite supply, get ready while you still can.
[06:14.640 --> 06:21.960]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic, it's Alex Jones, and now your
[06:21.960 --> 06:26.320]  host, Owen Troyer.
[06:26.320 --> 06:38.040]  Think about the epic times you're in, where the entire world and its governments are involved
[06:38.040 --> 06:48.600]  in the planning and the execution of a pandemic, some call it a scamdemic, a pandemic, a fake
[06:48.600 --> 06:54.680]  pandemic, call it whatever you want, they pulled it off, they did it worldwide, and
[06:54.680 --> 07:04.640]  now they are forcing citizens, they are forcing humans to consume their big pharmaceutical
[07:04.640 --> 07:17.800]  product, their DNA therapy technology, using the fear of their plandemic to roll it out,
[07:17.800 --> 07:26.240]  and then the holding you hostage with lockdowns and shutting down your businesses and churches
[07:26.240 --> 07:33.400]  and the threats, if you don't comply, holding you hostage to the pandemic, forcing you to
[07:33.400 --> 07:40.640]  consume the big pharmaceutical product, and it's hard to really wrap your mind around
[07:40.640 --> 07:45.440]  it, it's hard to accept that that's the reality.
[07:45.440 --> 07:51.120]  But once you can understand that, and how diabolical it is, you begin to open your mind
[07:51.120 --> 07:58.280]  and your heart to many of the diabolical truths that we are experiencing that people
[07:58.280 --> 08:03.160]  are in denial about.
[08:03.160 --> 08:11.800]  And so, when you have people getting the vaccine, and then dropping dead days later, whether
[08:11.800 --> 08:22.200]  it's famous American athletes like Hank Aaron, or it is the public health ambassador of India,
[08:22.200 --> 08:29.360]  who promotes the vaccine, says it's great, then dies after getting it.
[08:29.360 --> 08:37.160]  That is not a coincidence.
[08:37.160 --> 08:42.080]  When you had panels of doctors around the world that came out a year ago and said there's
[08:42.080 --> 08:46.600]  no need for these lockdowns, there's no need for these closures, there's no need for this
[08:46.600 --> 08:50.400]  response to a COVID virus, if anything, we should be getting outside more, we should
[08:50.400 --> 08:56.800]  continue to live our normal lives, we shouldn't be wearing masks, but no, the global health
[08:56.800 --> 09:03.080]  establishment, which is supposed to have your best interest in mind, supposed to care about
[09:03.080 --> 09:09.360]  your health, told you to wear a mask after they told you not to wear a mask, then they
[09:09.360 --> 09:13.440]  told you to wear a mask, then they said wear two masks, wear three if you have them, four
[09:13.440 --> 09:22.600]  if you can afford it, maybe not in the Biden economy, but you can afford five.
[09:22.600 --> 09:31.520]  And then you had high school athletes dropping from oxygen deprivation that happened last
[09:31.520 --> 09:38.480]  summer too, the media didn't report it, now it's happening again and the coaches and local
[09:38.480 --> 09:42.640]  media is actually a little more privy to what's going on, oh, it's the mask, they can't get
[09:42.640 --> 09:49.440]  oxygen, oh, that makes sense.
[09:49.440 --> 09:56.360]  And now you have a story up at infowars.com, disturbing, vaccine zoomed with microscope
[09:56.360 --> 10:05.760]  appears to show living cells and organisms mixed in, soylent green is people, laboratory
[10:05.760 --> 10:12.200]  footage of what is alleged to be Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine shows puzzled German scientists
[10:12.200 --> 10:18.440]  debating what exactly they're looking at under the microscope, as apparently organisms separate
[10:18.440 --> 10:23.640]  from the viral particles are discovered, it's not quite clear to me what we have seen here,
[10:23.640 --> 10:28.880]  some scientists said, so this is content from the Pfizer vaccine, a colleague said, this
[10:28.880 --> 10:34.480]  is from Pfizer, yes, wow, but do you know what it is yet?
[10:34.480 --> 10:43.040]  No, it could be a more gel in.
[10:43.040 --> 10:59.320]  It goes on from there, so imagine a super contagious, if you will, gain of function is the term
[10:59.320 --> 11:06.480]  they use, so a gain of function research virus, which is just one of the number one viruses,
[11:06.480 --> 11:14.080]  the flu virus, the COVID virus, gain of function research was to be shut down in a US lab,
[11:14.080 --> 11:18.680]  it was then moved to a lab in Wuhan, China where they continued the research, it then
[11:18.680 --> 11:27.040]  escaped from that lab, we had multiple drills and events and planning about a pandemic in
[11:27.040 --> 11:33.480]  2020, even using the COVID virus as the pretext, and everything else that followed with the
[11:33.480 --> 11:43.080]  censorship and the shutdowns, and then on the back end, now billions, they say billions
[11:43.080 --> 11:54.000]  of vaccines have been administered worldwide, that's some freaky, deaky stuff, and then they
[11:54.000 --> 11:59.720]  zoom in on the vaccine with a microscope and they say, what the hell is that?
[11:59.720 --> 12:07.080]  I've covered threads on Twitter where someone, a viral thread where someone has their vaccine
[12:07.080 --> 12:12.040]  card and say, oh, for the first time in my life, I'm glad I have asthma, look, I got
[12:12.040 --> 12:17.120]  my vaccine first, I'm having awful, horrible side effects, but I'm still really glad, and
[12:17.120 --> 12:21.600]  then it's all these other people chiming in, I had this side effect, I had that side effect,
[12:21.600 --> 12:26.840]  but they're still celebrating that they've been vaccinated in the new religion where
[12:26.840 --> 12:32.920]  George Floyd is the saint, he sacrificed himself is what they say, so now they sacrifice themselves
[12:32.920 --> 12:37.520]  for what they believe is the greater good, getting vaccinated, and if that means becoming
[12:37.520 --> 12:45.120]  infertile, if that means getting Guillain-Barre or Bell's palsy or hell dying, well that's
[12:45.120 --> 12:49.920]  just the fight, that's just the good fight for the good lib.
[12:49.920 --> 12:57.800]  So now Jimmy Dore post this, I had my second Moderna shot last Saturday, I'm still experiencing
[12:57.800 --> 13:03.320]  flu-like symptoms, body aches, mild headaches, and waves of exhaustion that come out of nowhere.
[13:03.320 --> 13:06.800]  Should I be concerned that this is lasting for a week?
[13:06.800 --> 13:09.120]  Should he be concerned?
[13:09.120 --> 13:14.120]  Should you be concerned, Jimmy?
[13:14.120 --> 13:23.040]  What do you think, not to make light of your plight, but that vaccine poisoned you, bud.
[13:23.040 --> 13:31.680]  I know you don't like to admit it, I know it's a tough pill to swallow.
[13:31.680 --> 13:36.160]  Anyone else have similar experience, he asks, and then it's the same thing, and you can
[13:36.160 --> 13:43.240]  go down on the list and everybody talks about the awful side effects, shortness of breath,
[13:43.240 --> 13:51.240]  fatigue, somebody diagnosed with Bell's palsy, my life has been miserable since the shot,
[13:51.240 --> 13:58.240]  and again, you can go down there and scroll through all of these things.
[13:58.240 --> 14:01.680]  And then you have people on there saying, don't worry, the side effects are better than getting
[14:01.680 --> 14:04.800]  the virus, what?
[14:04.800 --> 14:08.400]  Remember it came out that most people that get the virus don't even ever know they had
[14:08.400 --> 14:09.400]  it.
[14:09.400 --> 14:17.200]  Remember that deal, COVID arm is the new trend after you get the vaccine, COVID arm, what
[14:17.200 --> 14:24.240]  to know after getting the Moderna Pfizer vaccine, folks, they have waiting areas.
[14:24.240 --> 14:30.160]  After you get the vaccine, they have waiting areas where they have people sit aside in
[14:30.160 --> 14:33.160]  case they have an adverse reaction, they have to sit there for 10, 15 minutes and then they'll
[14:33.160 --> 14:35.200]  let you go.
[14:35.200 --> 14:40.120]  Most people begin to have severe reactions within 10 to 15 minutes, they may seize up,
[14:40.120 --> 14:44.160]  they may collapse, they may faint, and so they have to wait in the waiting area to make
[14:44.160 --> 14:48.160]  sure that they don't faint or keel over and need emergency support right then and there
[14:48.160 --> 14:51.680]  on the scene from getting the vaccine.
[14:51.680 --> 14:56.720]  Yeah, this is diabolical.
[14:56.720 --> 15:03.600]  Yeah, this is a very corrupt planet.
[15:03.600 --> 15:11.320]  This is a very corrupt world government that we're just starting to see into, that we're
[15:11.320 --> 15:17.080]  just starting to see work itself out, that we're just starting to see how it operates,
[15:17.080 --> 15:25.400]  that we're just starting to see its actual levers of power, and this is just the beginning.
[15:25.400 --> 15:28.080]  This is just the beginning.
[15:28.080 --> 15:32.440]  And they're sending SWAT teams to churches that won't shut down, they've arrested business
[15:32.440 --> 15:34.800]  owners that won't shut down.
[15:34.800 --> 15:42.440]  Most people are completely over the fake pandemic by now, but see, they still have to get you
[15:42.440 --> 15:48.360]  to take that jab, and so they pay social media influencers to promote it, they pay cable
[15:48.360 --> 15:54.120]  news networks to promote it, and the FDA doesn't even approve it, the side effects are worse
[15:54.120 --> 16:20.800]  than the virus, and this is the planet you're experiencing, this is life on Earth.
[16:20.800 --> 16:32.080]  So, I want to tell you something now, but before we move on to the next clip, it's our

[18:58.780 --> 19:06.660]  One of the most popular memes on the Internet in the last decade has been Alex Jones was
[19:06.660 --> 19:07.660]  right.
[19:07.660 --> 19:13.300]  There are two teamly trends, number one on platforms like Twitter and Facebook, making
[19:13.300 --> 19:16.060]  the globalists pull their hair out in anger.
[19:16.060 --> 19:18.220]  Let me tell you, we are Tomorrow's News today.
[19:18.220 --> 19:19.220]  Thanks to your support.
[19:19.220 --> 19:23.580]  We're still on air at Infowars.com and Bandai Video, radio stations and TV stations across
[19:23.580 --> 19:24.580]  the country.
[19:24.580 --> 19:28.580]  Our film Endgame, censored and taken offline by Amazon when it hit number one a few years
[19:28.580 --> 19:30.580]  ago, is now available again.
[19:30.580 --> 19:33.180]  We have repredited it on high quality DVD in HD.
[19:33.180 --> 19:34.660]  It has a zero country code.
[19:34.660 --> 19:38.220]  Meaning anyone in the world is authorized to make copies of it and I'm asking you to
[19:38.220 --> 19:41.660]  get the original, make copies, give it to everyone you know, get it on local access
[19:41.660 --> 19:45.540]  TV, give it to your pastors, your police chiefs, your state reps, your prime ministers, whatever
[19:45.540 --> 19:46.740]  you do, warn the world.
[19:46.740 --> 19:51.500]  This film uses their own documents and those statements 14 years ago to expose them.
[19:51.500 --> 19:55.060]  It's more important than ever, available at InfowarsStore.com.
[19:55.060 --> 20:03.020]  That's InfowarsStore.com, Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[20:03.020 --> 20:19.620]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Commence Center and the heart of the Resistance.
[20:19.620 --> 20:29.020]  And now, your host, Olin Troyer.
[20:29.020 --> 20:36.220]  Much of the world is awakening to the global government conspiracy that was hiding in plain
[20:36.220 --> 20:45.780]  sight and is against you, the individual being empowered against you, the individual controlling
[20:45.780 --> 20:49.980]  your own fate.
[20:49.980 --> 20:53.980]  And there's been a lot of developments recently that have exposed this to people, whether
[20:53.980 --> 20:59.620]  it's the theft of our elections that are being investigated in Arizona, whether it's the
[20:59.620 --> 21:05.060]  COVID fake pandemic, scandemic that crushed the economy, made the richest people in the
[21:05.060 --> 21:07.420]  world richer.
[21:07.420 --> 21:11.900]  They had drills and somehow knew it was all coming, came out of a lab in China, they covered
[21:11.900 --> 21:16.060]  it up.
[21:16.060 --> 21:23.300]  What you were seeing there was footage of a anti-lockdown march in Canada.
[21:23.300 --> 21:28.860]  The pushing of the vaccine.
[21:28.860 --> 21:33.420]  That was in UK, thank you.
[21:33.420 --> 21:39.060]  So now that global government is out in the open, we have the chance to reject it.
[21:39.060 --> 21:48.020]  But we have to admit it, accept it, be truthful, be honest about how diabolical it is and wholeheartedly
[21:48.020 --> 21:49.020]  reject it.
[21:49.020 --> 21:56.660]  And I don't know what to do with this mystery element of the factors, which is the insane
[21:56.660 --> 22:02.660]  mentally ill-deranged radical left that seems to want global enslavement, seems to want
[22:02.660 --> 22:03.740]  global government.
[22:03.740 --> 22:07.860]  Very odd, but that's the truth.
[22:07.860 --> 22:09.220]  They live the big lie.
[22:09.220 --> 22:12.340]  They love the big media lie.
[22:12.340 --> 22:14.460]  There's another element that's woken people up.
[22:14.460 --> 22:19.820]  They've seen the media, the mainstream media, the television news just turn out to be complete
[22:19.820 --> 22:30.620]  outright frauds and liars, tellers of tales.
[22:30.620 --> 22:35.180]  I want to finish up on this vaccine coverage here before we have Laura Loomer joining us
[22:35.180 --> 22:37.540]  with an exciting announcement coming up.
[22:37.540 --> 22:42.140]  Again, you can find these threads on Twitter where people just talk about their negative
[22:42.140 --> 22:45.860]  vaccine side effects.
[22:45.860 --> 22:50.660]  I prefer to be organic.
[22:50.660 --> 22:51.740]  I'm an organic human.
[22:51.740 --> 22:59.220]  I don't take mRNA gene therapy vaccines.
[22:59.220 --> 23:03.940]  Now we know that, I believe the number was 78%, who knows, it's about three quarters
[23:03.940 --> 23:10.300]  of the people hospitalized or died from COVID were obese.
[23:10.300 --> 23:16.380]  And CNN is celebrating this list of all the free stuff you can get if you get your vaccine.
[23:16.380 --> 23:19.460]  I don't have the whole list in front of me, but here's some short ones for you.
[23:19.460 --> 23:23.820]  Krispy Kreme Donuts, get yourself a nice glaze.
[23:23.820 --> 23:31.020]  Junior's Cheesecake goes right to your behind, Nathan's Hot Dogs.
[23:31.020 --> 23:32.620]  What do you think's in those?
[23:32.620 --> 23:37.140]  White Castle, yes, because skinny people are known to eat there.
[23:37.140 --> 23:43.380]  So they know that being obese is one of the worst things for your health.
[23:43.380 --> 23:52.820]  They know that in particular, being obese can heighten your risk for COVID or COVID complications.
[23:52.820 --> 23:56.940]  But hey, get that vaccine and then go get yourself a Krispy Kreme.
[23:56.940 --> 23:59.940]  I mean, think about it, you could have a whole day.
[23:59.940 --> 24:04.660]  Go get yourself a vaccine, get your Krispy Kreme donut for breakfast, get your Nathan's
[24:04.660 --> 24:06.940]  Hot Dogs for lunch.
[24:06.940 --> 24:11.820]  Go to White Castle for dinner and by the time you're crapping your pants, you'll be shoving
[24:11.820 --> 24:14.460]  a Junior's Cheesecake down your throat.
[24:14.460 --> 24:18.260]  But hey, that free vaccine was worth it, baby.
[24:18.260 --> 24:22.860]  Yeah, you're a little numb in your left arm and you can't really walk straight anymore,
[24:22.860 --> 24:30.420]  but whew, was that glazed donut greater or what?
[24:30.420 --> 24:35.660]  And you continue to see the stories, India's public health ambassador dies day after taking
[24:35.660 --> 24:36.660]  COVID vaccine.
[24:36.660 --> 24:41.300]  He promotes it, he says it's great, he takes it, he dies.
[24:41.300 --> 24:47.180]  And they always want to cover this up, whether it's Hank Aaron or the health ambassador in
[24:47.180 --> 24:48.180]  India.
[24:48.180 --> 24:54.660]  Oh, oh, I can get a free beer, I can get a free lap dance, oh yeah, all kinds of stuff.
[24:54.660 --> 24:55.660]  You get that vaccine.
[24:55.660 --> 24:58.380]  I mean, imagine, what happened to the basic instinct?
[24:58.380 --> 25:04.020]  You know, a guy comes to your neighborhood with a white man and says, hey kids, want
[25:04.020 --> 25:08.700]  some candy?
[25:08.700 --> 25:14.740]  Pennywise the clown, there's popcorn down here, it's a circus.
[25:14.740 --> 25:19.940]  Don't you want some popcorn?
[25:19.940 --> 25:20.940]  That's the vaccine.
[25:20.940 --> 25:27.980]  Hey, look, I got a vaccine for you, it's a jab.
[25:27.980 --> 25:33.980]  There's Krispy Kreme donuts, there's Nathan's hot dogs, there's white dogs, there's white
[25:33.980 --> 25:44.180]  castles, there's strip clubs, come on, get your vaccine, come down here with me.
[25:44.180 --> 25:46.900]  Don't you want to hang out with me?
[25:46.900 --> 25:54.220]  With all the donuts and strippers and beers, we've got cold beers.
[25:54.220 --> 26:00.820]  Come on down here, get the jab, I gotta need you to take that jab though.
[26:00.820 --> 26:08.300]  Meanwhile, Merck pulls out, pulls the plug on COVID-19 vaccine program after disappointing
[26:08.300 --> 26:13.380]  trial data, oops, yeah, just another one with disappointing trial data.
[26:13.380 --> 26:16.340]  Most of them didn't even care, most of them had the disappointing trial data and then
[26:16.340 --> 26:18.540]  still rolled it out to market.
[26:18.540 --> 26:25.660]  MIT studies suggest six foot social distancing, limited occupancy rates are completely pointless.
[26:25.660 --> 26:30.620]  Yeah, don't say, boy, who would have guessed that?
[26:30.620 --> 26:36.540]  Some schmuck, they would have thought the whole thing was garbage, some schmuck, looks
[26:36.540 --> 26:44.300]  like the schmuck was right, but hey, let's check out what's going on.
[26:44.300 --> 26:50.980]  We've got more side effects here, clip five, if the Krispy Kreme donut and the Nathan hot
[26:50.980 --> 27:01.980]  dogs and a white castle wasn't enough, maybe some herpes will be good for you.
[27:01.980 --> 27:10.340]  But in roll clip five, herpes infections may be a side effect of the COVID-19 vaccine.
[27:10.340 --> 27:13.700]  Scientists in Israel are researching six cases in which all patients were giving that
[27:13.700 --> 27:20.420]  Pfizer jab and later developed herpes zoster, commonly known as shingles.
[27:20.420 --> 27:24.380]  The infection starts off as a small rash, but can include a long lasting burning sensation
[27:24.380 --> 27:26.100]  even after the rash is gone.
[27:26.100 --> 27:31.620]  But don't worry, you can still get a Krispy Kreme donut.
[27:31.620 --> 27:39.340]  And I hear the strippers are really nice too, they give you a free lap dance for every jab.
[27:39.340 --> 27:42.860]  So it's just another side effect and you know, they'll continue to promote it.
[27:42.860 --> 27:48.420]  Joe Biden just put out a tweet saying, get vaccinated America, that's not totalitarian
[27:48.420 --> 27:49.420]  at all.
[27:49.420 --> 27:52.460]  That's not scary at all.
[27:52.460 --> 27:57.580]  With all the side effects and the death and everything and the virus, 99.9% are probable.
[27:57.580 --> 28:04.740]  Now you have European doctors in Norway that's based on their data, you have less of a risk
[28:04.740 --> 28:08.620]  of having complications from COVID than from the COVID vaccine.
[28:08.620 --> 28:10.060]  And what did President Trump say?
[28:10.060 --> 28:13.940]  We can't have a cure that's worse than the disease.
[28:13.940 --> 28:17.940]  Well, that's lockdowns, that's a shutdown, that's the vaccine.
[28:17.940 --> 28:22.620]  So this is the new world order, this is global government, this is medical tyranny.
[28:22.620 --> 28:27.300]  This is what it's like to be treated like a slave, like a commodity.
[28:27.300 --> 28:31.940]  And this is just the beginning, they're just getting you used to it.
[28:31.940 --> 28:36.380]  Laura Loomer joining us on the other side with a big announcement, you're not going
[28:36.380 --> 28:37.380]  to want to miss it.
[28:37.380 --> 28:41.140]  Remember folks, InfowarsStore.com, check it out.
[28:41.140 --> 28:48.500]  Vezo beat complete, back in stock, blood flow, blood flow, blood flow, Vezo beat complete,
[28:48.500 --> 28:49.500]  ladies and gentlemen.
[28:49.500 --> 28:54.580]  I think we may be missing one of these bottles of Vezo beat complete.
[28:54.580 --> 28:59.820]  I may pull a Clintons at the White House, fine now.
[28:59.820 --> 29:08.100]  Epic is one of only a handful of domain registers that promote free speech and freedom of association.
[29:08.100 --> 29:12.580]  And they know that Big Tech is buying up almost all the other major companies and engaging
[29:12.580 --> 29:16.020]  in massive censorship and organized crime racketeering.
[29:16.020 --> 29:19.020]  That's why they've been massively expanding their services.
[29:19.020 --> 29:22.780]  So whether you have domains or want to register a domain or want help building a website or
[29:22.780 --> 29:27.500]  want servers or any other major service, they've got it all and they're expanding.
[29:27.500 --> 29:33.300]  And if you go to InfowarsDomains.com and follow that link, you get all their services at the
[29:33.300 --> 29:39.500]  lowest price and 25% of your sign up for a new domain or a domain you move goes to fund
[29:39.500 --> 29:40.500]  the Infowar.
[29:40.500 --> 29:44.980]  And then we get 5% as well for any servers or any other type of services that you get
[29:44.980 --> 29:45.980]  from them.
[29:45.980 --> 29:49.980]  So it's a win-win as we build a true open free internet again because the globalists
[29:49.980 --> 29:52.420]  are destroying what was open and what was free.
[29:52.420 --> 29:57.300]  So InfowarsDomains.com, the revolution starts there.
[29:57.300 --> 30:00.420]  InfowarsDomains.com, take action now.
[30:00.420 --> 30:05.780]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021 and I just want to say something.
[30:05.780 --> 30:10.140]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over
[30:10.140 --> 30:11.140]  the years.
[30:11.140 --> 30:14.740]  It is truly an answer to prayer and I am so blessed and thankful for all of you, the
[30:14.740 --> 30:15.740]  listeners of this show.
[30:15.740 --> 30:18.620]  I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you.
[30:18.620 --> 30:22.260]  Whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter you got red
[30:22.260 --> 30:23.260]  blood.
[30:23.260 --> 30:27.940]  And if you love freedom and justice and if you love our innocent children, we are brothers
[30:27.940 --> 30:32.420]  and sisters together and it has just been an incredible experience to work with you
[30:32.420 --> 30:33.420]  over the years.
[30:33.420 --> 30:36.740]  And as crazy as your things are, I want to keep working under the future.
[30:36.740 --> 30:40.300]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[30:40.300 --> 30:45.380]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[30:45.380 --> 30:47.700]  But again, that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[30:47.700 --> 30:51.300]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've
[30:51.300 --> 30:56.380]  done and just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you and
[30:56.380 --> 30:59.260]  then hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support him for worse.
[30:59.260 --> 31:00.260]  God bless.
[31:00.260 --> 31:07.340]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[31:07.340 --> 31:11.900]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[31:11.900 --> 31:14.380]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[31:14.380 --> 31:18.020]  Could their objective be world domination?
[31:18.020 --> 31:21.300]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[31:21.300 --> 31:26.340]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating
[31:26.340 --> 31:29.460]  80% of humanity is in hand.
[31:29.460 --> 31:32.100]  The globalist fear this film made 14 years ago.
[31:32.100 --> 31:34.340]  It is the blueprint for their plan to figure out the world.
[31:34.340 --> 31:35.820]  It is the blueprint for the great reset.
[31:35.820 --> 31:36.820]  It is in-game.
[31:36.820 --> 31:41.360]  Blueprint for global enslavement, available right now at infowarstore.com with a zero country
[31:41.360 --> 31:43.980]  code meaning you can make copies of it anywhere in the world.
[31:43.980 --> 31:48.180]  I strongly suggest you get the film in-game at infowarstore.com.
[31:48.180 --> 31:52.540]  I strongly suggest you make copies and share it and if you take that action, I demand you
[31:52.540 --> 31:55.980]  tell others that you've given a copy too that they make copies and share it as well.
[31:55.980 --> 32:01.100]  That will trigger distribution by proxy, meaning we the people cannot be stopped.
[32:01.100 --> 32:06.100]  Last week I had a caller to my radio slash TV transmission and he said to me, he said,
[32:06.100 --> 32:10.460]  Alex, there's all these facts and all these numbers of vaccines being recalled and people
[32:10.460 --> 32:12.700]  dying from it and people getting sick.
[32:12.700 --> 32:16.700]  How do I reach out to my friends and family and explain to them and to warn them about
[32:16.700 --> 32:21.980]  the danger and I said to him something very profound because it's so true, trust your
[32:21.980 --> 32:27.060]  gut, trust your spirit to the Bible's house and I said, ask those friends, those family,
[32:27.060 --> 32:32.460]  those neighbors, do you feel good about this vaccine and his answer was no, they don't
[32:32.460 --> 32:33.460]  feel good about it.
[32:33.460 --> 32:34.860]  So, go with your gut.
[32:34.860 --> 32:39.540]  Well, let me ask you again, how does your gut feel about getting the storeable food?
[32:39.540 --> 32:41.700]  How does your gut feel about getting down the countryside?
[32:41.700 --> 32:44.500]  How does your gut feel about getting guns and ammo to protect yourself?
[32:44.500 --> 32:46.660]  Well, I know what your gut's telling you.
[32:46.660 --> 32:49.740]  We have the best storeable food at the highest quality at the lowest prices you're going
[32:49.740 --> 32:50.740]  to find.
[32:50.740 --> 32:56.060]  10% off at infowarstore.com right now or for Paragalix.com.
[32:56.060 --> 33:04.100]  Go with your gut and find the info war infowarstore.com.
[33:04.100 --> 33:21.060]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:21.060 --> 33:25.820]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[33:25.820 --> 33:27.540]  You want to stop tyranny?
[33:27.540 --> 33:32.540]  Well, so does he, live from the info wars.com studios.
[33:32.540 --> 33:43.820]  It's Alex Jones, and now your host, Owen Shroyer.
[33:43.820 --> 33:51.580]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen, and you are tuned in to the most banned news network
[33:51.580 --> 33:56.580]  in the world, info wars, next year's news today.
[33:56.580 --> 34:00.020]  That's why it's always important to support us by shopping at infowarstore.com and that's
[34:00.020 --> 34:05.340]  why it's important to support people like Laura Loomer, who are totally banned and he
[34:05.340 --> 34:09.300]  platformed as well, who joins me now.
[34:09.300 --> 34:14.820]  Laura, I know that you're up to quite a few things politically and then some local activism
[34:14.820 --> 34:16.620]  there in Florida.
[34:16.620 --> 34:20.500]  What is the next big thing, what is the next thing people need to know Laura Loomer is
[34:20.500 --> 34:21.500]  up to?
[34:21.500 --> 34:24.020]  Thanks for having me on, Owen.
[34:24.020 --> 34:29.140]  So as we've discussed on your show over the last couple of weeks, as Governor DeSantis
[34:29.140 --> 34:35.500]  proposed his big, big tech censorship bill, the Florida legislative session ends on Friday.
[34:35.500 --> 34:40.900]  And so what this means is that the Republican legislature here in Florida has five days
[34:40.900 --> 34:45.180]  to include the amendment in this big tech bill or else it's just going to be an empty
[34:45.180 --> 34:51.660]  bill and, you know, Governor DeSantis has promised to deliver the most comprehensive
[34:51.660 --> 34:56.860]  and toughest big tech censorship bill in the country is going to fall short because as
[34:56.860 --> 34:59.500]  Governor currently stands, the bill has no teeth.
[34:59.500 --> 35:04.540]  And so on Tuesday I'm going to be having a press conference and a big rally to put pressure
[35:04.540 --> 35:08.020]  on these lawmakers to include the amendments in the bill and Michelle Malkin's coming
[35:08.020 --> 35:14.020]  down, McFuentes, Lauren Witzke, Vincent James, and we're hoping to have, you know, hundreds
[35:14.020 --> 35:19.940]  of not thousands of people show up because we need this legislation to be more than just
[35:19.940 --> 35:22.620]  to do nothing bill.
[35:22.620 --> 35:24.780]  So get more into the details here.
[35:24.780 --> 35:28.540]  What is it that you want to see done that DeSantis isn't doing?
[35:28.540 --> 35:29.540]  And how does this translate?
[35:29.540 --> 35:34.740]  I mean, how can people in Florida take justice into their own hands against big tech versus
[35:34.740 --> 35:38.340]  other states if you can, you know, get more teeth into this bill?
[35:38.340 --> 35:39.340]  Right.
[35:39.340 --> 35:43.700]  So when Governor DeSantis went on Tucker Carlson about two months or so ago and he said that
[35:43.700 --> 35:49.540]  he was going to, you know, pass the toughest tech legislation in the country, he said that
[35:49.540 --> 35:53.660]  it was going to effectively prevent big tech from deplatforming political candidates.
[35:53.660 --> 35:57.940]  Well, if you look at the language within the bill, you'll see that a candidate is defined
[35:57.940 --> 36:03.100]  as a statewide candidate, which is a senator, somebody running for a statewide position.
[36:03.100 --> 36:07.780]  That doesn't include federal positions like my campaign, which is a congressional campaign,
[36:07.780 --> 36:12.540]  or if Donald Trump decides to run for president again in 2024, he will not be protected by
[36:12.540 --> 36:14.180]  this legislation.
[36:14.180 --> 36:19.820]  And so as it currently stands, Governor DeSantis himself would not be protected by this legislation.
[36:19.820 --> 36:24.580]  And so one of the amendments that I've proposed is making it retroactive.
[36:24.580 --> 36:30.220]  And so the way it's worded right now is that it would only penalize big tech social media
[36:30.220 --> 36:35.660]  companies $10,000 to $100,000 a day if they deplatform a candidate.
[36:35.660 --> 36:40.340]  So that is an active action, of course, that's not going to apply to somebody like myself
[36:40.340 --> 36:45.860]  or somebody like Donald Trump or Governor DeSantis if he is banned or deplatformed by social media
[36:45.860 --> 36:47.940]  prior to announcing his reelection.
[36:47.940 --> 36:52.180]  Let me ask you this, though, what if, yes, you're banned everywhere on Twitter, but let's
[36:52.180 --> 36:56.500]  say you started a new account, would it then fall into the realm of that saying, hey, no,
[36:56.500 --> 36:57.500]  this is a new account.
[36:57.500 --> 37:00.300]  Laura Loomer for Congress, they can't ban you now.
[37:00.300 --> 37:04.500]  You can't have new accounts because what Twitter and Facebook did is they created new policies
[37:04.500 --> 37:06.460]  when I was the candidate.
[37:06.460 --> 37:11.300]  So their policy was prior to me announcing that if you are a candidate, you will get
[37:11.300 --> 37:12.300]  a verified account.
[37:12.300 --> 37:15.260]  Then when I filed it was you have to win your primary, right, because they thought I wasn't
[37:15.260 --> 37:16.260]  going to win my primary.
[37:16.260 --> 37:20.260]  Then I won my primary and they changed the policy to basically everybody besides Laura
[37:20.260 --> 37:21.900]  Loomer can have an account.
[37:21.900 --> 37:25.780]  Then Facebook saw they were going to encounter the same problem and so they created a policy
[37:25.780 --> 37:30.380]  that said if you have been previously banned, it doesn't matter if you're running for office
[37:30.380 --> 37:33.980]  or even if you become an elected official, you are not allowed to have an account.
[37:33.980 --> 37:39.020]  Okay, so they've already written basically policy to fight back against this.
[37:39.020 --> 37:43.820]  Yes, they have and they did it in 2019 and 2020.
[37:43.820 --> 37:48.660]  And so I tried to let DeSantis' team know and I met with these Florida Republican legislators
[37:48.660 --> 37:53.500]  to tell them, you know, listen, it's not as simple as just creating a new account.
[37:53.500 --> 37:57.500]  It's not as simple as, oh, okay, this bill is going to penalize tech companies and then
[37:57.500 --> 37:59.100]  candidates are going to be on.
[37:59.100 --> 38:03.100]  First of all, these companies are worth over $7 trillion, which is more than a quarter
[38:03.100 --> 38:07.940]  of the United States economy, our $21 trillion U.S. economy, okay?
[38:07.940 --> 38:14.180]  $100,000 a day or $10,000 a day is like pennies in a bucket for these people.
[38:14.180 --> 38:15.180]  It's not punitive.
[38:15.180 --> 38:20.300]  And so the damages need to be upwards of $100 million a day, which is what I've been proposing.
[38:20.300 --> 38:24.180]  And so I've been calling, some of the amendments are to increase the fines and the penalties
[38:24.180 --> 38:26.220]  so that they're actually punitive.
[38:26.220 --> 38:30.780]  And then another one as well is to make it retroactive so that it applies to candidates
[38:30.780 --> 38:32.940]  who have been previously de-platformed.
[38:32.940 --> 38:36.900]  And then I'm also calling on the legislation to include penalties for payment processors
[38:36.900 --> 38:41.380]  because it's very surface level, this discussion that these lawmakers are having.
[38:41.380 --> 38:43.420]  They only want to talk about Facebook and Twitter.
[38:43.420 --> 38:45.300]  Well, what about Chase?
[38:45.300 --> 38:46.860]  What about Stripe that just ban he?
[38:46.860 --> 38:47.860]  What about YouTube?
[38:47.860 --> 38:48.980]  What about PayPal, which is ban me?
[38:48.980 --> 38:50.420]  What about Venmo, right?
[38:50.420 --> 38:55.020]  All these companies that are disenfranchising people and harming people's lives and threatening
[38:55.020 --> 39:01.220]  their livelihood, debanking them, trying to blacklist them financially, there also needs
[39:01.220 --> 39:03.900]  to be penalties for companies like that, right?
[39:03.900 --> 39:04.900]  Don't you agree?
[39:04.900 --> 39:06.580]  Well, here's my issue.
[39:06.580 --> 39:12.460]  I feel like nobody is really taking this issue seriously because we can write bills and stuff.
[39:12.460 --> 39:15.860]  But to me, these Republicans are going and they're having conversations and they're probably
[39:15.860 --> 39:19.980]  meeting with lawyers and they're saying, okay, well, what can we do?
[39:19.980 --> 39:21.300]  Somebody has to take a step.
[39:21.300 --> 39:22.460]  Somebody has to take a leap.
[39:22.460 --> 39:27.060]  Like you said, maybe it's $100 million fine if you censor a political candidate.
[39:27.060 --> 39:32.900]  I mean, somebody has to make some really large leaps here to push back against big tech censorship
[39:32.900 --> 39:35.180]  because right now they are clearly not threatened.
[39:35.180 --> 39:36.780]  They lie under oath.
[39:36.780 --> 39:39.580]  They can censor Donald Trump, the president of the United States.
[39:39.580 --> 39:44.660]  So to me, they show no fear at all over any politician writing any serious legislation
[39:44.660 --> 39:45.660]  right now.
[39:45.660 --> 39:46.660]  Exactly.
[39:46.660 --> 39:50.580]  And that's because a lot of these Republican lawmakers don't know what they're talking
[39:50.580 --> 39:51.580]  about.
[39:51.580 --> 39:56.860]  And why would big tech show fear if the fines are, oh, we're going to censor big, we're
[39:56.860 --> 40:02.380]  going to find big tech $100,000 a day if they do platform candidates?
[40:02.380 --> 40:06.580]  Well, big tech clearly has their lawyers and their legal team and they see that this doesn't
[40:06.580 --> 40:09.180]  currently apply to deep platforms candidates, right?
[40:09.180 --> 40:12.180]  And so you're talking about people like myself and Donald Trump.
[40:12.180 --> 40:17.460]  And then if you're worth trillions of dollars, well, what's $100,000 a day, you know?
[40:17.460 --> 40:22.220]  For them, it's almost going to pay off in the long run if they keep people censored
[40:22.220 --> 40:25.740]  and deep platform by paying a couple of million dollars in fines than it would be if they were
[40:25.740 --> 40:29.860]  to allow somebody like myself or Donald Trump to gain access or governor to stanzas, you
[40:29.860 --> 40:30.860]  know?
[40:30.860 --> 40:35.380]  And of course they're not going to be scared because these lawmakers also, they keep on
[40:35.380 --> 40:40.180]  approaching it from a section 230 standpoint, which is, you know, nonsensical because section
[40:40.180 --> 40:43.940]  230 is a federal mandate.
[40:43.940 --> 40:49.340]  So if section 230 is a federal law, okay, you can't have a state legislation addressing
[40:49.340 --> 40:50.780]  section 230.
[40:50.780 --> 40:55.420]  And so the lawmakers need to start approaching the big tech issue as a civil rights issue,
[40:55.420 --> 41:00.260]  not a section 230 issue because people's civil rights are being violated when they're discriminated
[41:00.260 --> 41:02.940]  against and deep platform for simply being conservative.
[41:02.940 --> 41:07.500]  And that's why, you know, about a month and a half ago I filed to run for Congress again.
[41:07.500 --> 41:12.340]  You can go to Loomer2022.com and support my congressional campaign today.
[41:12.340 --> 41:17.180]  And one of the things that I want to do aside from breaking up big tech is also updating
[41:17.180 --> 41:21.300]  our civil rights laws to include political affiliation as a protected class so that we
[41:21.300 --> 41:24.300]  can protect people from being discriminated against.
[41:24.300 --> 41:30.540]  Laura, I want to talk about that event coming up again next week on the other side of this
[41:30.540 --> 41:31.540]  break.
[41:31.540 --> 41:33.300]  So sit right there, folks.
[41:33.300 --> 41:38.900]  Again, Laura Loomer, one of those banned people out there just like InfoWars and, you know,
[41:38.900 --> 41:42.700]  we're kind of the mothership to give Laura a platform to give other banned people a platform
[41:42.700 --> 41:44.020]  like myself.
[41:44.020 --> 41:47.380]  And it's all supported by UShoppingandInfoWarsstore.com.
[41:47.380 --> 41:50.940]  So folks, if you want Laura to keep fighting the good fight, support her, support us so
[41:50.940 --> 41:55.660]  we can get her on air and let you know about her new developments and her events.
[41:55.660 --> 41:56.940]  Go to InfoWarsstore.com.
[41:56.940 --> 41:59.500]  We still have the t-shirt special happening, by the way.
[41:59.500 --> 42:04.020]  A hot t-shirt right now, Alex Jones was right t-shirt.
[42:04.020 --> 42:06.020]  The Alex Jones was right t-shirt.
[42:06.020 --> 42:10.020]  A lot of people are into this right now with the vaccines causing all the crazy side effects
[42:10.020 --> 42:11.020]  and everything.
[42:11.020 --> 42:13.420]  And that's currently, is that our daily deal right now?
[42:13.420 --> 42:15.220]  I didn't even know that was our daily deal.
[42:15.220 --> 42:17.980]  We're selling it at cost right now.
[42:17.980 --> 42:24.860]  So these t-shirts cost us about $10 to purchase and get to the warehouse and have the crew

[42:52.780 --> 43:00.540]  We'll be right back on the other side with Laura Loomer.
[43:00.540 --> 43:03.340]  I 1 trillion percent believe what I'm saying.
[43:03.340 --> 43:05.340]  Hell, everybody knows that.
[43:05.340 --> 43:06.820]  I just tell you what I'm really thinking.
[43:06.820 --> 43:09.180]  People say, well, Jones, why the hell did you just say that on air?
[43:09.180 --> 43:10.180]  That's embarrassing.
[43:10.180 --> 43:12.980]  Well, I'm not going to stop with only the good stuff about me.
[43:12.980 --> 43:17.580]  But I'll tell you this right now, you're nuts if you don't get storeable food.
[43:17.580 --> 43:21.740]  And I've got the biggest best sponsor with the highest quality food at the lowest price
[43:21.740 --> 43:22.740]  you're going to find.
[43:22.740 --> 43:24.620]  Can you spend triple or four times it?
[43:24.620 --> 43:27.140]  It can like gourmet stuff that tastes even better.
[43:27.140 --> 43:29.460]  Yeah, most of the stuff tastes amazing.
[43:29.460 --> 43:30.460]  Some of it tastes okay.
[43:30.460 --> 43:34.100]  The point is, it's high quality, it's nutritious, and it lasts a long time.
[43:34.100 --> 43:37.580]  And compared to other competitors, they can't even get close.
[43:37.580 --> 43:39.140]  We've got three months, six months.
[43:39.140 --> 43:44.500]  Your supply's right now, and I twisted their arms so hard to give you 10 percent off again.
[43:44.500 --> 43:49.980]  Because you're so conditionally bound or super sale, we're doing it one more time.
[43:49.980 --> 43:57.660]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarsstore.com, 10 percent off of the entire catalog of my favorite supply.
[43:57.660 --> 44:00.660]  Get ready while you still can.
[44:00.660 --> 44:03.460]  The equation is very simple.
[44:03.460 --> 44:08.420]  The mega banks control the media, they control big pharma, they control academia.
[44:08.420 --> 44:15.020]  They control the military, industrial complex, they control big tech, and everywhere that
[44:15.020 --> 44:21.380]  they have been in control in the third world, they have established absolute total despotism
[44:21.380 --> 44:22.380]  and de-immunization.
[44:22.380 --> 44:28.860]  It is the Western Christian idea of human freedom that ended slavery and that promoted
[44:28.860 --> 44:31.780]  women's rights and so much more that actually threatens them.
[44:31.780 --> 44:37.300]  So because they can't defeat that empowering ethic, they instead co-opted, turned it upside
[44:37.300 --> 44:44.820]  down, and used the idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom and the free market
[44:44.820 --> 44:47.620]  that threatens their monopolies of control.
[44:47.620 --> 44:51.660]  That's why they target Infowars, because we understand the keys to defeating them.
[44:51.660 --> 44:56.380]  But the only way our transmission gets out is if you promote Infowars, it may end up
[44:56.380 --> 44:57.380]  in the end.
[44:57.380 --> 44:58.380]  So redouble your efforts.
[44:58.380 --> 45:00.380]  We're all in this together.
[45:00.380 --> 45:07.380]  A hundred and seventy years ago, the British royal family financed scientists to develop
[45:07.380 --> 45:09.820]  a plan for scientific dictatorship worldwide.
[45:09.820 --> 45:13.540]  That grew into the Robber Barons and then into the Eugenics movement, Hitler, and of
[45:13.540 --> 45:14.860]  course the rest is history.
[45:14.860 --> 45:19.340]  Our film, Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement, has been censored on Amazon and many other
[45:19.340 --> 45:23.980]  big platforms, sending the documentary film back to the top of the charts.
[45:23.980 --> 45:26.980]  It's been selling online for as much as $300 a copy.
[45:26.980 --> 45:30.980]  Ladies and gentlemen, I have mass produced it again in the highest quality HD.
[45:30.980 --> 45:35.580]  It is available after not being available for years at InfowarsStore.com.
[45:35.580 --> 45:39.980]  We're selling it for $14.95 for one copy, as low as $3.95 when you buy them in bulk.
[45:39.980 --> 45:44.660]  You share with your friends and family and every DVD has a zero country code, meaning
[45:44.660 --> 45:47.300]  you can burn copies of it anywhere in the world.
[45:47.300 --> 45:48.300]  I'm asking you to.
[45:48.300 --> 45:49.300]  I'm begging you to.
[45:49.300 --> 45:55.340]  This film predicted the great reset, the newer takeover, the fake virus, and so much more.
[45:55.340 --> 45:58.060]  That's why the film is evergreen and more explosive than ever.
[45:58.060 --> 46:01.060]  Get it today at InfowarsStore.com.
[46:01.060 --> 46:10.060]  In the early 1990s, it was a really funny movie that came out called Wayne's World.
[46:10.060 --> 46:14.500]  Even before I had an access to a show in the mid-1990s, I wouldn't call that movie and
[46:14.500 --> 46:15.500]  thought, man, that was fun.
[46:15.500 --> 46:20.460]  In fact, you speak out, have your own ideas, and even if you're a nerd, you're still entertaining
[46:20.460 --> 46:21.460]  because you're real.
[46:21.460 --> 46:23.580]  Well, what do they say in Wayne's World?
[46:23.580 --> 46:27.540]  We're not worthy, we're not worthy.
[46:27.540 --> 46:31.420]  Every day when I cover these huge topics, I don't feel worthy to talk to you because
[46:31.420 --> 46:34.580]  these topics are so huge or so real, but I'm trying to tell you the truth.
[46:34.580 --> 46:36.780]  I'm trying to get it right, and most of the time we do.
[46:36.780 --> 46:38.420]  The globalists love lying to you.
[46:38.420 --> 46:39.780]  They love manipulating you.
[46:39.780 --> 46:42.420]  They enjoy destroying humanity.
[46:42.420 --> 46:47.180]  They enjoy manipulating ideas and using people's ignorance against them.
[46:47.180 --> 46:49.780]  That for me is really set down and disgusting.
[46:49.780 --> 46:55.780]  So you've got to pledge for myself and the whole InfoWars crew that we will never join
[46:55.780 --> 46:56.780]  the globalists.
[46:56.780 --> 47:03.580]  We will never knowingly manipulate you because we know we're all in this together.
[47:03.580 --> 47:11.780]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[47:11.780 --> 47:17.460]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[47:17.460 --> 47:22.620]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[47:22.620 --> 47:25.740]  At the time it got almost no coverage.
[47:25.740 --> 47:30.060]  But I told listeners and viewers, this is a key seismic moment.
[47:30.060 --> 47:35.980]  I had been watching what was unfolding in India, in Australia, in South Africa and areas
[47:35.980 --> 47:42.220]  of Western Europe, where governments were saying, hey, these experimental vaccines are
[47:42.220 --> 47:46.060]  causing major, major health problems.
[47:46.060 --> 47:47.820]  They're not approved.
[47:47.820 --> 47:51.900]  We're just rolling it out and testing it on the public in general.
[47:51.900 --> 47:55.540]  Something is desperately wrong here.
[47:55.540 --> 48:01.060]  And then Merck, one of the most corrupt, evil, big pharma companies out there with a horrible
[48:01.060 --> 48:07.240]  history of dumping deadly vaccines on the market like Gardasil, pulled out of not one
[48:07.240 --> 48:12.940]  but two of their vaccine programs and announced that they were exiting the COVID-19 vaccine
[48:12.940 --> 48:21.020]  race entirely because you cannot create a vaccine for the common cold.
[48:21.020 --> 48:22.780]  They actually said that.
[48:22.780 --> 48:28.180]  They said you should just get herd immunity and that there is no vaccine because of mutations
[48:28.180 --> 48:30.860]  and that this would basically be a fraud.
[48:30.860 --> 48:37.700]  You can go read the article in Forbes from back in January of this year.
[48:37.700 --> 48:46.140]  Merck pulls the plug on COVID-19 vaccine program after disappointing trial data, but when you
[48:46.140 --> 48:50.220]  read their full statement, it tells you everything you need to know.
[48:50.220 --> 48:56.900]  So why on this live Sunday show, the Alex Jones broadcast with Owen Schroyer and others,
[48:56.900 --> 49:01.300]  why am I focusing back on something from January?
[49:01.300 --> 49:07.820]  Because now if you look at the maps put out by the CDC and by the UN of the world, by
[49:07.820 --> 49:12.820]  now they wanted half the population of the planet vaccinated and they have enough vaccine
[49:12.820 --> 49:15.060]  to already do that.
[49:15.060 --> 49:20.460]  But the highest level countries are only at 15% and that of course is the United States
[49:20.460 --> 49:22.780]  because we're so brainwashed.
[49:22.780 --> 49:29.940]  Japan is at less than 5% and so are most other nations because people know this is experimental.
[49:29.940 --> 49:35.020]  They know that if they skip the animal trials and they read about all the death and destruction
[49:35.020 --> 49:37.340]  that's taking place.
[49:37.340 --> 49:43.180]  Remember two months ago when India banned the Pfizer shot and said it's very dangerous,
[49:43.180 --> 49:50.740]  it's killing people, they're doing unauthorized trials here, this is criminal.
[49:50.740 --> 49:55.060]  Remember that they had news guard owned by Bill Gates come out and fact check me and said
[49:55.060 --> 49:56.060]  that it wasn't true.
[49:56.060 --> 49:58.580]  But of course it was true.
[49:58.580 --> 50:02.860]  Well now the other five vaccines have been banned in different parts of the world all
[50:02.860 --> 50:07.460]  over the world and so think about the victory we've had, they're trying to act like oh everybody
[50:07.460 --> 50:12.620]  loves vaccines, they're 100% state defective, there's no issues, don't listen to conspiracy
[50:12.620 --> 50:17.220]  theorists, when all the top scientists, I mean thousands of them and epidemiologists
[50:17.220 --> 50:24.580]  and virologists and the head of the EU advisory board, Wolfgang Wudard and the former head
[50:24.580 --> 50:32.020]  scientist at Pfizer all come out and say this is depopulation, this is to cause infertility,
[50:32.020 --> 50:35.100]  this is going to attack women's uteruses, back in December they said that and now the
[50:35.100 --> 50:39.180]  data is clear, they're right, it's doing exactly that because they can look at something and
[50:39.180 --> 50:41.860]  see what it's really designed to do.
[50:41.860 --> 50:46.180]  So when you hear this thing doesn't work for COVID or work for a cold and that's what
[50:46.180 --> 50:49.700]  people get reinfected, that's only part of the fraud.
[50:49.700 --> 50:54.660]  It does work on attacking proteins in your brain, in the placenta, in the uterus, in
[50:54.660 --> 51:01.460]  the ovaries, in the testicles and other areas and this is a bold bio-weapon attack and
[51:01.460 --> 51:06.980]  yes it's shedding and yes even NPR had to admit that one concern about the mRNA vaccines
[51:06.980 --> 51:13.740]  and others, the virus vector vaccines of JJ and AstraZeneca is that it goes into the
[51:13.740 --> 51:19.300]  cells using another virus to deliver the system and will create viral shedding of real super
[51:19.300 --> 51:20.300]  strains.
[51:20.300 --> 51:25.180]  But we have something God gave us called the immune system, so you notice when I was talking
[51:25.180 --> 51:29.100]  about vitamin D and vitamin C and zinc over a year ago the media was like that's kooky,
[51:29.100 --> 51:36.060]  the UN says that's not needed, it's like saying water is not needed or oxygen, you now notice
[51:36.060 --> 51:42.340]  you turn on TV all you see is vitamin D3 ads, zinc ads and vitamin C ads, multivitamin
[51:42.340 --> 51:47.660]  ads, that's great, humanity is waking up.
[51:47.660 --> 51:53.180]  Humanity is waking up to the fact that we can battle these monsters with the simple
[51:53.180 --> 51:58.660]  things that are essential that God gave us and that their giant hoax of evil is in deep
[51:58.660 --> 51:59.660]  trouble.
[51:59.660 --> 52:02.780]  Now they're going to keep leveraging their vaccine passports, they've got a big useful
[52:02.780 --> 52:05.340]  idiot population here in the West will go along with it, they're going to keep trying
[52:05.340 --> 52:07.980]  to make us warm masks, they're going to keep pecking at us and trying to dominate us,
[52:07.980 --> 52:11.100]  bringing in their market to be cashless society.
[52:11.100 --> 52:18.220]  But the good news at the end of the day is the wheels have come off this thing at every
[52:18.220 --> 52:23.500]  level and it's very, very sad, how many people have had to die like Hank Aaron and Marvin
[52:23.500 --> 52:28.260]  Hagler and how many people had to get deathly sick like Ben Stein, you need to see the article
[52:28.260 --> 52:36.700]  on infowars.com, the top actor in India, the national health spokesperson, I mean the
[52:36.700 --> 52:43.300]  guy is like their Arnold Schwarzenegger, their Brad Pitt, he took the shot and one day later
[52:43.300 --> 52:47.460]  died of a heart attack because it's even on the inserts that these shots can cause an
[52:47.460 --> 52:52.060]  autoimmune result, they can cause inflammation, they can do so many other things, we've got
[52:52.060 --> 52:56.780]  arteries that are already partially blocked, it swells the arteries up and you die and
[52:56.780 --> 53:01.740]  that's what happened and so it's the trail of death around this that they're not going
[53:01.740 --> 53:06.460]  to be able to cover up and that was the vaccine that the government of India thought was safe.
[53:06.460 --> 53:11.500]  But again, if you try to create something for the common cold, you have so many of these
[53:11.500 --> 53:16.940]  viruses already in your body that are naturally occurring and this is decided by the strands
[53:16.940 --> 53:21.620]  of viruses of RNA, not even full strands, that it's going to cause an autoimmune response
[53:21.620 --> 53:25.660]  and have you attack your own body, you understand, that's what the top scientists are saying,
[53:25.660 --> 53:30.180]  a massive autoimmune response in your own body where your body attacks itself or you
[53:30.180 --> 53:36.220]  have an allergic response and your body swells up and so it's very, very sad this is happening
[53:36.220 --> 53:40.700]  but the good news is despite big tech censorship, despite all the things they've been doing,
[53:40.700 --> 53:43.020]  the truth is getting out.
[53:43.020 --> 53:46.780]  Now big tech is responsible for this, not just for censorship but for being some of
[53:46.780 --> 53:49.260]  the main owners of big pharma.
[53:49.260 --> 53:54.380]  So they got together with this, they couldn't get RNA, technologies authorized last decade,
[53:54.380 --> 53:58.940]  no government would legalize them because they're so dangerous and so what do these
[53:58.940 --> 54:01.140]  monsters do?
[54:01.140 --> 54:03.500]  They got together with big tech, they got together with the UN, they got together with
[54:03.500 --> 54:07.460]  Bill Gates and all the major health groups in the world that his foundation publicly
[54:07.460 --> 54:11.860]  finances except for the 32 countries he's been thrown out of like India, they still had
[54:11.860 --> 54:17.380]  over 130 countries on his payroll, they decided to get together with one script to say it's
[54:17.380 --> 54:21.300]  been effective, to say it was tested, to say it was great, to say you'd have to take it
[54:21.300 --> 54:25.500]  to buy and sell or have a job or go on an airplane or leave your house and with huge
[54:25.500 --> 54:29.980]  bullying and huge lying and huge corruption, huge fear mongering and exaggerating COVID-19
[54:29.980 --> 54:35.820]  deaths 101 and counting all the other deaths as COVID-19 and sending sick people to nursing
[54:35.820 --> 54:39.340]  homes to hopefully get the death numbers up and committing every crime you can imagine
[54:39.340 --> 54:41.540]  and then some.
[54:41.540 --> 54:44.620]  Now their whole hoax is falling apart and the whole world is turning against them and
[54:44.620 --> 54:48.660]  they're all over the news saying it's crazy, people are refusing in mass, they're evil,
[54:48.660 --> 54:51.860]  they won't take the shots, that's right because the majority of people know you're a group
[54:51.860 --> 54:55.900]  of murdering corrupt globalist corporations who don't just want money and power, you're
[54:55.900 --> 54:59.580]  going to be able to test on us like guinea pigs and you want to be able to depopulate
[54:59.580 --> 55:03.860]  us and play God because you think we're stupid and this whole thing was a giant IQ test in
[55:03.860 --> 55:04.860]  your own words.
[55:04.860 --> 55:08.260]  Well guess what, we're passing the IQ test and we're recognizing that you're a bunch
[55:08.260 --> 55:12.420]  of exterminist monsters they're going to have to be dealt with and that you're committing
[55:12.420 --> 55:16.860]  crimes against humanity and violating the Nuremberg Code and the Zima Convention and
[55:16.860 --> 55:20.460]  that you will be held accountable.
[55:20.460 --> 55:22.140]  So help me God.
[55:22.140 --> 55:27.940]  So back to Owen Schreuer in the live broadcast, I'll be back in studio tomorrow 11 a.m. central.
[55:27.940 --> 55:29.820]  Thank you for keeping us on the air.
[55:29.820 --> 55:33.540]  Without your support of info wars there's no way humanity would have woken up to this
[55:33.540 --> 55:35.660]  as fast as we did.
[55:35.660 --> 55:39.020]  All of you have been instrumental in this fight, it's been negative, it's been painful,
[55:39.020 --> 55:43.700]  it's been scary, it's been frustrating, it's put a lot of years on me, I can tell you that.
[55:43.700 --> 55:49.300]  But months ago God touched my heart and said relax Jones, just do the right thing, I'll
[55:49.300 --> 55:53.260]  carry us the rest away and I've had a lot more peace since then and I'm getting a lot
[55:53.260 --> 55:54.260]  more peace now.
[55:54.260 --> 55:57.540]  But as long as we speak out and take action, God will do the rest.
[55:57.540 --> 56:04.100]  It's hard to watch these monsters do this, it's hard to watch them carry all this out.
[56:04.100 --> 56:06.900]  But together, again if we do the right thing we will defeat them.
[56:06.900 --> 56:10.140]  But now when you start talking about holding them accountable for all the deaths and all
[56:10.140 --> 56:14.180]  the illnesses, you're up saying that they're going to waive the law, now that lawsuits
[56:14.180 --> 56:15.980]  go forward against vaccine makers.
[56:15.980 --> 56:20.220]  How about criminal charges like happened to Merck when they know only put HIV and hepatitis
[56:20.220 --> 56:22.940]  in the blood and the factor A scandal.
[56:22.940 --> 56:28.060]  We need criminal charges, we need demonstrations outside Bill Gates' house and Microsoft.
[56:28.060 --> 56:33.340]  We need those outside Google for covering up all the medical scientists and the doctors
[56:33.340 --> 56:34.700]  that warned us.
[56:34.700 --> 56:39.060]  These are complicit mad scientists, you're not just liberals now censoring people, you
[56:39.060 --> 56:44.300]  know the evil conservatives, you're now helping big pharma poison the planet, you're monsters.
[56:44.300 --> 56:49.420]  This isn't left versus right, this is human versus tyranny and people are coming together.
[56:49.420 --> 56:54.460]  You know they're using that in the news saying, Trump supporters are the most vaccine hesitant.
[56:54.460 --> 56:58.820]  That's why we need to educate them to trick liberals to go oh, if Trump supporters are
[56:58.820 --> 57:06.380]  against it, I'm for it, when statistically it's highly educated liberals with degrees
[57:06.380 --> 57:09.660]  that are refusing the vaccines and then of course conservatives after that.
[57:09.660 --> 57:13.540]  I mean look at the main anti-vax movement or a bunch of scientists and liberals.
[57:13.540 --> 57:18.780]  So again, this isn't working, people are coming together, it's very, very exciting and we
[57:18.780 --> 57:20.060]  just got to keep getting the word out.
[57:20.060 --> 57:23.900]  So folks don't just go to sleep when they back off these lockdowns and stuff, they're
[57:23.900 --> 57:25.380]  going to bring them right back.
[57:25.380 --> 57:29.980]  You've got to fully route out and fully expose the entire false paradigm, the entire false
[57:29.980 --> 57:30.980]  lie.
[57:30.980 --> 57:36.500]  All right, Owen Schreuer and hour number two are coming up on the Sunday Alex Jones show
[57:36.500 --> 57:40.100]  and then Sunday Live that Owen hosts is coming up for the two hours after that.
[57:40.100 --> 57:41.820]  We're going to go to break, we'll be right back.
[57:41.820 --> 57:45.700]  Please everybody, you know, tune in now, history is happening, but without you, the enemy will
[57:45.700 --> 57:46.700]  win with you.
[57:46.700 --> 57:47.700]  We will have victory.
[57:47.700 --> 57:49.820]  God bless and good luck, stay with us.
[57:49.820 --> 57:53.180]  Gerald in South Carolina, go ahead, you're on the air, trying to move quicker.
[57:53.180 --> 57:54.180]  Hey Alex, welcome.
[57:54.180 --> 57:58.420]  I would like to say first off, thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all
[57:58.420 --> 57:59.420]  this stupidity.
[57:59.420 --> 58:02.820]  Wanted to warn people I've been trying to get ahold of you for a year, okay?
[58:02.820 --> 58:09.540]  I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away.
[58:09.540 --> 58:14.820]  Living defense saved my life, they had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed
[58:14.820 --> 58:15.820]  me.
[58:15.820 --> 58:16.820]  Living defense brought me back.
[58:16.820 --> 58:22.540]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible, Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[58:22.540 --> 58:29.300]  This is Matthew 24, verse nine, then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall
[58:29.300 --> 58:36.260]  kill you and you shall be hated of all nations for my name sake and then shall many be offended
[58:36.260 --> 58:39.660]  and shall betray one another and shall hate one another.
[58:39.660 --> 58:41.380]  That's right where we're at brother.
[58:41.380 --> 58:45.820]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say and
[58:45.820 --> 58:51.180]  that's why the enemy hates it because God created this country.
[58:51.180 --> 58:56.660]  Every product you hear me on air advertising, we have it stock in our warehouse in Austin,
[58:56.660 --> 58:57.660]  Texas.
[58:57.660 --> 58:58.660]  Every product.
[58:58.660 --> 59:02.660]  So if you order it, you've got it shipped out in a couple days, sometimes the same day.
[59:02.660 --> 59:06.620]  Others get confused when they hear me talk about the fact that the supply chain's breaking
[59:06.620 --> 59:13.500]  down and its future orders, its product we're trying to reorder to get back in that we're
[59:13.500 --> 59:14.500]  having trouble with.
[59:14.500 --> 59:20.140]  I mean, I'm talking about double, triple, quadruple delivery times and it's across not
[59:20.140 --> 59:22.500]  just the supplement, vitamin, mineral industry.
[59:22.500 --> 59:23.500]  It's across every industry.
[59:23.500 --> 59:28.300]  So the globalists have successfully devastated the economy.
[59:28.300 --> 59:32.500]  That's why I'm saying you need to visit info or store.com today and get high quality supplements
[59:32.500 --> 59:37.780]  while you still can and storeable food at info or store.com because we have it in stock,
[59:37.780 --> 59:39.020]  it's ready to ship.
[59:39.020 --> 59:43.780]  But with the supply chain breakdowns, prices are going up, availability is going down and
[59:43.780 --> 59:44.780]  it's just crazy.
[59:44.780 --> 59:53.660]  So please get products while you still can and support the info or store.com.
[59:53.660 --> 1:00:19.340]  We hope you're having a good weekend out there.
[1:00:19.340 --> 1:00:25.020]  Stay tuned in to the Alex Jones show on this Sunday and thank you for tuning in.
[1:00:25.020 --> 1:00:27.020]  We thank you for supporting us at info or store.com.
[1:00:27.020 --> 1:00:31.740]  Owen Troyer here for another hour and then I hand the baton to Harrison Smith who will
[1:00:31.740 --> 1:00:33.220]  be hosting Sunday Night Live.
[1:00:33.220 --> 1:00:35.340]  Laura Loomer has stuck around.
[1:00:35.340 --> 1:00:40.300]  I wanted her to come back and again talk about the event coming up this week just so people
[1:00:40.300 --> 1:00:41.300]  tuned in.
[1:00:41.300 --> 1:00:44.020]  A lot of patriots in Florida, very active as well.
[1:00:44.020 --> 1:00:47.780]  So Laura, once again, tell people about the event coming up on Tuesday and any details
[1:00:47.780 --> 1:00:49.420]  you think they might need to know.
[1:00:49.420 --> 1:00:54.860]  Yeah, thanks so and so the event is going to be Tuesday from 4.30 to 6.30 and Tom Beach
[1:00:54.860 --> 1:00:59.260]  at a place called Trump Corner where we have a lot of Trump events and so the information
[1:00:59.260 --> 1:01:00.260]  is on my gap.
[1:01:00.260 --> 1:01:01.260]  The flyer is on my parlor.
[1:01:01.260 --> 1:01:02.260]  It's also on my telegram.
[1:01:02.260 --> 1:01:07.700]  I just posted it a couple hours ago and Michelle Malkin is going to be there, Nick Fuentes,
[1:01:07.700 --> 1:01:12.700]  Lauren Witzke, Vincent James and we're going to have a really big rally to let people know
[1:01:12.700 --> 1:01:17.980]  that if the legislator here in Florida doesn't get it together and include these amendments
[1:01:17.980 --> 1:01:27.380]  in this bill, this big tech bill, HB7013 or Senate Bill 7072, the Senate Companion Bill,
[1:01:27.380 --> 1:01:32.060]  then we're not going to have an effective tech bill here in Florida and candidates like
[1:01:32.060 --> 1:01:37.500]  myself and Donald Trump and others will be the platforms and it's not just about me,
[1:01:37.500 --> 1:01:38.500]  right?
[1:01:38.500 --> 1:01:41.660]  This is about every candidate running for office in the state of Florida and I'll tell
[1:01:41.660 --> 1:01:46.900]  you right now, big tech social media censorship is without a doubt the most important issue
[1:01:46.900 --> 1:01:51.180]  in the country right now is not the entire world and if we don't start finding solutions
[1:01:51.180 --> 1:01:56.300]  to rein in big tech and get rid of big tech tyranny, no Republicans will ever be elected
[1:01:56.300 --> 1:01:57.300]  ever again.
[1:01:57.300 --> 1:01:58.700]  They're just never going to allow it.
[1:01:58.700 --> 1:02:00.940]  We saw what big tech did this last election cycle.
[1:02:00.940 --> 1:02:04.380]  They colluded just as people like you and I and Alex have been saying they would for
[1:02:04.380 --> 1:02:05.380]  years.
[1:02:05.380 --> 1:02:07.900]  They colluded with each other to steal the election.
[1:02:07.900 --> 1:02:14.060]  Laura, speaking of stealing elections, what do you make of the audit happening in Arizona
[1:02:14.060 --> 1:02:20.900]  right now where the Democrats are sending dozens, 73 attorneys down there to try to
[1:02:20.900 --> 1:02:25.380]  muddy the waters with that, but the audit continues, what are your thoughts on that?
[1:02:25.380 --> 1:02:26.780]  What are you seeing down there?
[1:02:26.780 --> 1:02:30.540]  Well, I think it's really interesting, if you didn't steal an election and there's
[1:02:30.540 --> 1:02:35.620]  no voter fraud, why do you have to send attorneys if people just want to recount ballots?
[1:02:35.620 --> 1:02:38.260]  That's the problem, right?
[1:02:38.260 --> 1:02:41.100]  You think the Democrats are acting suspiciously?
[1:02:41.100 --> 1:02:48.820]  Well, I look, real winners, when you're a winner, when you really win an election or
[1:02:48.820 --> 1:02:53.420]  you win any type of tournament or anything, right, whenever you're a winner, you don't
[1:02:53.420 --> 1:02:56.540]  have to silence your opposition if you won fair and square.
[1:02:56.540 --> 1:03:00.700]  If you're a real winner, you don't have to intimidate others and threaten others with
[1:03:00.700 --> 1:03:06.540]  litigation if you really are a real winner and you didn't cheat and you didn't steal.
[1:03:06.540 --> 1:03:07.540]  That's interesting.
[1:03:07.540 --> 1:03:12.980]  Yeah, the Democrats have to censor all their opposition and then they have to cheat to
[1:03:12.980 --> 1:03:17.620]  win elections and then they pretend they're the popular party with all their Hollywood
[1:03:17.620 --> 1:03:23.900]  minions and their mainstream media towing the party line, giving the narrative to them
[1:03:23.900 --> 1:03:24.900]  as well.
[1:03:24.900 --> 1:03:27.700]  It's very incredible stuff to witness this.
[1:03:27.700 --> 1:03:33.300]  I was at Mar-a-Lago last night and I was there for the House Freedom Fund fundraiser
[1:03:33.300 --> 1:03:37.260]  with the members of the Freedom Caucus and President Trump was talking about voter fraud
[1:03:37.260 --> 1:03:42.060]  and he was talking about how Republicans really need to start fighting back and that he said
[1:03:42.060 --> 1:03:45.900]  that this is the most important issue as well and President Trump at Mar-a-Lago during
[1:03:45.900 --> 1:03:49.740]  his speech last night also talked about big tech censorship and how important it is that
[1:03:49.740 --> 1:03:54.060]  we get a hold on that and I actually had an opportunity to speak with President Trump
[1:03:54.060 --> 1:03:59.460]  about the big tech social media censorship and what I've been doing to combat this last
[1:03:59.460 --> 1:04:02.860]  week when I was at Mar-a-Lago as well and I'm looking forward to having a meeting with
[1:04:02.860 --> 1:04:07.980]  him at Mar-a-Lago in the near future to discuss this because look, the Democrats are colluding
[1:04:07.980 --> 1:04:13.860]  openly with big tech to silence people and I do believe that voter fraud and the voter
[1:04:13.860 --> 1:04:17.980]  integrity issue and big tech censorship are all one and the same issue because when you
[1:04:17.980 --> 1:04:22.820]  look at the people who are financing the voter fraud, it's people like Mark Zuckerberg, right?
[1:04:22.820 --> 1:04:28.220]  The $400 million in election operations for ballot boxes.
[1:04:28.220 --> 1:04:32.580]  So if we don't deal with the big tech social media tyrants, then we're not going to get
[1:04:32.580 --> 1:04:37.460]  a hold on voter fraud or voter regularities.
[1:04:37.460 --> 1:04:43.380]  That's Laura Loomer, follower on Gab, on Parler, on Telegram and see her in Florida on Tuesday.
[1:04:43.380 --> 1:04:44.380]  Laura, thank you.
[1:04:44.380 --> 1:04:48.780]  Thanks and hopefully InfoWars can come out as well because we'd love to have InfoWars
[1:04:48.780 --> 1:04:51.540]  there live streaming the event.
[1:04:51.540 --> 1:04:53.420]  You just had to do it to us, didn't you?
[1:04:53.420 --> 1:04:59.060]  You just had to put the pressure on me, live on air, the pressure cooker, I get it.
[1:04:59.060 --> 1:05:04.700]  This entire new world order system is about making you dependent, making you obsolete,
[1:05:04.700 --> 1:05:07.740]  making you a domesticated animal they control.
[1:05:07.740 --> 1:05:11.020]  They want to censor you, they want to dumb you down, they want to poison you and they
[1:05:11.020 --> 1:05:15.140]  want to control your ability to take care of yourself.
[1:05:15.140 --> 1:05:20.180]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to fund the InfoWars more than ever and you can do
[1:05:20.180 --> 1:05:24.860]  it while at the same time protecting yourself and your family and your neighbors.

[1:06:28.500 --> 1:06:34.340]  Us being live with you right now or you tuning in to a rebroadcast or the podcast or the
[1:06:34.340 --> 1:06:41.140]  archives at band.video is a victory in the face of global government.
[1:06:41.140 --> 1:06:44.540]  Every day we're on air is a victory, so keep us on air at ladies and gentlemen, shop at
[1:06:44.540 --> 1:06:46.060]  InfoWarsstore.com.
[1:06:46.060 --> 1:06:48.580]  We're very excited.
[1:06:48.580 --> 1:06:53.380]  We've got vaso beat complete back in stock and I'm not sure somebody left two bottles
[1:06:53.380 --> 1:06:55.180]  on the desk here.
[1:06:55.180 --> 1:06:58.700]  I think one of them, I think I'm going to have a five finger discount for one of these
[1:06:58.700 --> 1:06:59.700]  deals right here.
[1:06:59.700 --> 1:07:03.980]  I'm going to be like the Clintons in the White House and slink off from work today with a
[1:07:03.980 --> 1:07:05.620]  bottle of vaso beat complete.
[1:07:05.620 --> 1:07:06.620]  I'm a big fan.
[1:07:06.620 --> 1:07:11.860]  I have one at my normal desk, my weekday desk on the other side here, a vaso beat complete
[1:07:11.860 --> 1:07:13.820]  that I like to mix in with my water.
[1:07:13.820 --> 1:07:15.580]  I have one at home.
[1:07:15.580 --> 1:07:21.060]  It's all about blood flow, ladies and gentlemen, nitrates and blood flow.
[1:07:21.060 --> 1:07:28.420]  Beats are known as one of the top things you can eat, consume with nitrates.
[1:07:28.420 --> 1:07:33.260]  We've turned it into a liquid tincture, purified it, put it in this little bottle and sell
[1:07:33.260 --> 1:07:35.420]  it at InfoWarsstore.com.
[1:07:35.420 --> 1:07:41.380]  It's all about blood flow, ladies and gentlemen, blood flow, blood flow, blood flow.

[1:08:00.300 --> 1:08:02.420]  vaso beat complete.
[1:08:02.420 --> 1:08:05.100]  I want to show a couple of things here.
[1:08:05.100 --> 1:08:10.500]  First of all, we all know about what happened with the girl there in Columbus.
[1:08:10.500 --> 1:08:15.380]  You know, everything is so polarized, but you see all these people coming out and her
[1:08:15.380 --> 1:08:19.980]  mother saying, oh, she was such a sweet girl, and Makia Bryant, the one that got shot when
[1:08:19.980 --> 1:08:23.940]  she was trying to stab a girl to death, and people are going and looking at her TikTok
[1:08:23.940 --> 1:08:24.940]  videos.
[1:08:24.940 --> 1:08:25.940]  Oh, she was the sweetest thing.
[1:08:25.940 --> 1:08:26.940]  You know what?
[1:08:26.940 --> 1:08:29.380]  Maybe 99.9% of her life she was.
[1:08:29.380 --> 1:08:30.380]  Maybe she really was.
[1:08:30.380 --> 1:08:31.380]  Maybe she really was a sweetheart.
[1:08:31.380 --> 1:08:34.740]  But you know, in that moment, she was trying to stab a girl to death.
[1:08:34.740 --> 1:08:40.100]  And sometimes when you make a mistake like that, it ruins or even ends your life.
[1:08:40.100 --> 1:08:41.100]  And so it's sad.
[1:08:41.100 --> 1:08:44.100]  Nobody wants her to get shot and killed that day.
[1:08:44.100 --> 1:08:47.180]  But nobody wants to be stabbed to death either.
[1:08:47.180 --> 1:08:48.340]  And so that was the situation.
[1:08:48.340 --> 1:08:52.020]  But so now this is the new thing.
[1:08:52.020 --> 1:08:54.020]  They still do the hands up, don't shoot with Mike Brown.
[1:08:54.020 --> 1:08:56.180]  They do the I Can't Breathe with George Floyd.
[1:08:56.180 --> 1:08:59.700]  Now they're going to say, you're going to shoot me like Makia Bryant.
[1:08:59.700 --> 1:09:06.220]  Here's a exchange between an officer and some civilians where they try to poke at the officer,
[1:09:06.220 --> 1:09:09.580]  instigate the officer, saying, you're going to kill me like Makia Bryant, and listen to
[1:09:09.580 --> 1:09:11.180]  the officer's response.
[1:09:11.180 --> 1:09:14.540]  Oh, y'all going to kill me like Makia Bryant?
[1:09:14.540 --> 1:09:15.540]  Fuck.
[1:09:15.540 --> 1:09:17.140]  Are you going to stab somebody like her?
[1:09:17.140 --> 1:09:18.140]  No.
[1:09:18.140 --> 1:09:19.140]  But she called y'all for help.
[1:09:19.140 --> 1:09:20.140]  Fuck is you talking about.
[1:09:20.140 --> 1:09:21.140]  Get your goofy ass.
[1:09:21.140 --> 1:09:22.140]  Okay.
[1:09:22.140 --> 1:09:23.140]  So there you go.
[1:09:23.140 --> 1:09:25.740]  We'll have to drop that there.
[1:09:25.740 --> 1:09:27.900]  We apologize for the curse we're getting at.
[1:09:27.900 --> 1:09:28.900]  But yeah.
[1:09:28.900 --> 1:09:30.660]  So oh, you're going to shoot me like Makia Bryant.
[1:09:30.660 --> 1:09:32.300]  I'm glad the officer stood up for himself.
[1:09:32.300 --> 1:09:33.300]  I'm glad the officer responded.
[1:09:33.300 --> 1:09:37.900]  And you know, it must be tough for officers these days to have to put up with all the
[1:09:37.900 --> 1:09:44.260]  BS and the hatred and having a target on their back, and they can't even stand up for themselves.
[1:09:44.260 --> 1:09:48.140]  And so good for that officer for at least kind of standing up for himself a little bit
[1:09:48.140 --> 1:09:49.140]  there.
[1:09:49.140 --> 1:09:52.180]  But it's sad that what they're going to have to deal with because of the mainstream media
[1:09:52.180 --> 1:09:57.580]  and the Democrat Party's demonizing them and putting a target on their back.
[1:09:57.580 --> 1:10:01.820]  And again, you notice how the individual talking to the officer doesn't even know the story.
[1:10:01.820 --> 1:10:06.140]  Makia Bryant did not call the police.
[1:10:06.140 --> 1:10:12.220]  She had the police called on her or whatever group she was with that was starting a fight
[1:10:12.220 --> 1:10:13.220]  in the neighborhood.
[1:10:13.220 --> 1:10:18.820]  No, it was the girl standing there holding her dog with her family and her neighbors
[1:10:18.820 --> 1:10:23.140]  that called the cops because Makia Bryant and her friends were out of control.
[1:10:23.140 --> 1:10:29.420]  And she said she was going to go on a stabbing spree and she had a knife on her.
[1:10:29.420 --> 1:10:33.820]  And she's so out of control in this video, you know, and again, nobody even wants to
[1:10:33.820 --> 1:10:35.420]  be honest about what they see in this video.
[1:10:35.420 --> 1:10:42.780]  Makia Bryant, the other guy she was with, tried to curb stomp a woman into the pavement.
[1:10:42.780 --> 1:10:48.060]  Literally, she tried to curb stomp a woman's head into the pavement.
[1:10:48.060 --> 1:10:49.780]  Nobody seems to have a problem with that.
[1:10:49.780 --> 1:10:55.820]  Makia was also running around wildly swinging a knife.
[1:10:55.820 --> 1:10:57.860]  And so she gets into a scruff with one person.
[1:10:57.860 --> 1:10:59.980]  You see there she's in a scruffle with one person.
[1:10:59.980 --> 1:11:01.540]  The lady in the pink doesn't even do anything.
[1:11:01.540 --> 1:11:05.780]  And then she just gets up and she starts wildly swinging at her.
[1:11:05.780 --> 1:11:10.500]  So again, nobody wants to see anybody get shot by police.
[1:11:10.500 --> 1:11:18.300]  But when you go around swinging a knife at people, somebody's hopefully going to stop
[1:11:18.300 --> 1:11:19.300]  you.
[1:11:19.300 --> 1:11:22.540]  Now, here is Officer Tatum, Brandon Tatum, a beautiful segment.
[1:11:22.540 --> 1:11:24.780]  He goes off on the BBC network.
[1:11:24.780 --> 1:11:27.980]  It's good to have voices like Brandon Tatum out there.
[1:11:27.980 --> 1:11:28.980]  Here it is.
[1:11:28.980 --> 1:11:34.940]  Mr. Larry there, we can speak now to Brandon Tatum, a former police officer and founder
[1:11:34.940 --> 1:11:37.660]  of the officer Tatum.
[1:11:37.660 --> 1:11:40.140]  Thank you very much for coming on the program.
[1:11:40.140 --> 1:11:41.140]  My pleasure.
[1:11:41.140 --> 1:11:43.620]  So we're going to talk about a lot of the wider issues just in a moment.
[1:11:43.620 --> 1:11:47.380]  But first of all, just wanted to get your reaction to the conviction.
[1:11:47.380 --> 1:11:54.180]  Well, first of all, I think most of what I heard on the broadcast all the way here is
[1:11:54.180 --> 1:11:55.780]  confusing to me.
[1:11:55.780 --> 1:11:57.780]  I think we're living in the twilight zone.
[1:11:57.780 --> 1:12:01.300]  This conviction, in my personal opinion, did nothing for our country.
[1:12:01.300 --> 1:12:03.540]  I mean, people are living a lot.
[1:12:03.540 --> 1:12:07.340]  I mean, this was one police officer, one person in the community.
[1:12:07.340 --> 1:12:08.780]  They found him guilty.
[1:12:08.780 --> 1:12:11.220]  This was the swiftest justice I've ever seen in my life.
[1:12:11.220 --> 1:12:14.100]  The day after the film came out, he was arrested.
[1:12:14.100 --> 1:12:15.100]  He was tried.
[1:12:15.100 --> 1:12:17.580]  10 hours of deliberation, he was convicted.
[1:12:17.580 --> 1:12:22.180]  I'm not really sure why people are acting like this is monumental.
[1:12:22.180 --> 1:12:26.140]  Also, he did not get a fair trial, in my personal opinion.
[1:12:26.140 --> 1:12:27.860]  There was a lot of obstruction that happened.
[1:12:27.860 --> 1:12:31.500]  They paid the family out $27 million before the jury could be selected.
[1:12:31.500 --> 1:12:34.100]  I mean, they're going to have a case in appeal.
[1:12:34.100 --> 1:12:37.700]  So I don't know why people are celebrating, and I don't know why this is such a big focal
[1:12:37.700 --> 1:12:41.820]  point other than people are making money off of the pain of people in our country.
[1:12:41.820 --> 1:12:47.100]  So you're objecting, firstly, to some of the things that happened around the trial, which
[1:12:47.100 --> 1:12:50.500]  now that there is a conviction, I think we should probably park that.
[1:12:50.500 --> 1:12:57.540]  Secondly, you're upset, but there's an amalgamation here of a wider sense of a landmark case
[1:12:57.540 --> 1:13:00.700]  and this one specific court case.
[1:13:00.700 --> 1:13:03.500]  Yeah, this is not a landmark case.
[1:13:03.500 --> 1:13:06.260]  I think people are, this is a political agenda.
[1:13:06.260 --> 1:13:08.380]  They're pushing lies in our country.
[1:13:08.380 --> 1:13:10.500]  Policing in America is not inherently racist.
[1:13:10.500 --> 1:13:12.340]  We don't live in a racist country.
[1:13:12.340 --> 1:13:16.700]  This was an interaction between a police officer that I thought did the wrong thing and a black
[1:13:16.700 --> 1:13:22.860]  man who was on drugs, high, resisting arrest, and ended up being killed by that police officer.
[1:13:22.860 --> 1:13:24.420]  That's as simple as it can be.
[1:13:24.420 --> 1:13:29.220]  The president of the United States got out and made a fool of himself trying to promote
[1:13:29.220 --> 1:13:35.140]  racism in a simple police encounter that the officer got convicted on.
[1:13:35.140 --> 1:13:41.820]  So you reject President Biden's comments about systemic racism and it being a stain
[1:13:41.820 --> 1:13:43.620]  on the whole nation?
[1:13:43.620 --> 1:13:48.860]  Yes, President Biden is an idiot, in my personal opinion, and he's just talking because he's
[1:13:48.860 --> 1:13:51.260]  a politician, systemic racism.
[1:13:51.260 --> 1:13:57.060]  I mean, if you look at Joe Biden himself, he spoke at a Klu Klux Klan member's funeral
[1:13:57.060 --> 1:13:59.660]  and did the eulogy of Robert Byrd.
[1:13:59.660 --> 1:14:05.100]  I mean, he is white supremacy and racism if you want to say that is the case and now
[1:14:05.100 --> 1:14:06.180]  he's the president.
[1:14:06.180 --> 1:14:09.980]  So if he really cared about white supremacy and racism, he should step down as the president
[1:14:09.980 --> 1:14:13.260]  because he's an exemplification of that very thing.
[1:14:13.260 --> 1:14:16.500]  These people are just running their mouth and they're not being honest.
[1:14:16.500 --> 1:14:18.980]  We don't have a problem with racism in our country.
[1:14:18.980 --> 1:14:22.020]  We have a problem with people not following the law.
[1:14:22.020 --> 1:14:26.020]  We also have a problem with politicians making up things so they can get reelected.
[1:14:26.020 --> 1:14:27.740]  And that's exactly what has been happening.
[1:14:27.740 --> 1:14:29.660]  That's why you never see anything change.
[1:14:29.660 --> 1:14:30.980]  They're lying to us.
[1:14:30.980 --> 1:14:37.700]  So the rate of people being killed by police is the rate is higher amongst black people
[1:14:37.700 --> 1:14:41.060]  than amongst the rest of the population.
[1:14:41.060 --> 1:14:45.260]  But how do you account for that if that isn't a systemic racism problem?
[1:14:45.260 --> 1:14:46.260]  Yeah.
[1:14:46.260 --> 1:14:47.740]  First of all, it's not true.
[1:14:47.740 --> 1:14:50.220]  Twice as many white people go killed by police every year.
[1:14:50.220 --> 1:14:52.620]  Twice as many white people are killed unarmed by police every year.
[1:14:52.620 --> 1:14:53.620]  You just don't see it.
[1:14:53.620 --> 1:14:55.380]  There's a gentleman named Tony Tempah.
[1:14:55.380 --> 1:14:59.060]  I guarantee you anybody watching me have no idea who Tony Tempah is.
[1:14:59.060 --> 1:15:02.980]  Tony Tempah was murdered in the same fashion that George Floyd was killed.
[1:15:02.980 --> 1:15:06.660]  But because he was white, we don't hear about it and nobody cares about it.
[1:15:06.660 --> 1:15:10.060]  Nobody's talking about police reform when he was suffocated and killed.
[1:15:10.060 --> 1:15:12.620]  But they only talk about it because George Floyd is black.
[1:15:12.620 --> 1:15:16.780]  Black people commit over half of violent crimes in this country and only make up 13 percent
[1:15:16.780 --> 1:15:18.180]  of the population.
[1:15:18.180 --> 1:15:22.260]  They commit over half of the murders in this country, but only make up 13 percent of the
[1:15:22.260 --> 1:15:23.260]  population.
[1:15:23.260 --> 1:15:26.500]  And we can agree that 13 percent of the population aren't the criminals.
[1:15:26.500 --> 1:15:29.340]  There's only a small fraction of the black community that's doing this.
[1:15:29.340 --> 1:15:32.300]  So that explains why police are in the black communities more.
[1:15:32.300 --> 1:15:35.020]  And that explains why black people are incarcerated more.
[1:15:35.020 --> 1:15:38.780]  They are making up lies saying that it has anything to do with racism.
[1:15:38.780 --> 1:15:42.340]  Do you understand that there's black police officers too that patrol in many of these
[1:15:42.340 --> 1:15:43.860]  majority black cities?
[1:15:43.860 --> 1:15:44.860]  Are they racists?
[1:15:44.860 --> 1:15:46.620]  No, that's not the case.
[1:15:46.620 --> 1:15:50.380]  They're just making these things up in my personal opinion and they're riding a wave
[1:15:50.380 --> 1:15:57.940]  of dead black people in order to make money and be politically and get political leverage.
[1:15:57.940 --> 1:16:00.500]  The globalists are purposely collapsing our world.
[1:16:00.500 --> 1:16:04.220]  They are creating insecurity, crime, war, and famine.
[1:16:04.220 --> 1:16:08.740]  All of us should do everything we can to get prepared and get ready for ourselves and
[1:16:08.740 --> 1:16:11.380]  our families' sakes, but also our community.
[1:16:11.380 --> 1:16:16.540]  And CitizensStronghold.com is the best place to go to get high quality body armor at the
[1:16:16.540 --> 1:16:18.020]  lowest price you're going to find.

[1:17:00.500 --> 1:17:02.460]  It's very bittersweet.
[1:17:02.460 --> 1:17:05.260]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would.
[1:17:05.260 --> 1:17:07.340]  And now we have a lot of credibility, but I don't care about that.
[1:17:07.340 --> 1:17:08.940]  I care about beating the new world order.
[1:17:08.940 --> 1:17:14.180]  And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[1:17:14.180 --> 1:17:16.860]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us.
[1:17:16.860 --> 1:17:19.100]  For a lot of reasons, I can't tell you what's going on.
[1:17:19.100 --> 1:17:22.260]  But let's just say this, we're going to see this through to the end, we're going to stay
[1:17:22.260 --> 1:17:24.660]  on air as long as we can.
[1:17:24.660 --> 1:17:26.860]  So please pray for us and please buy the products.

[1:17:34.660 --> 1:17:36.060]  No, a lot of them don't.
[1:17:36.060 --> 1:17:40.700]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking
[1:17:40.700 --> 1:17:42.540]  up and looking for truth.
[1:17:42.540 --> 1:17:44.140]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[1:17:44.140 --> 1:17:47.580]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[1:17:47.580 --> 1:17:51.060]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.

[1:18:59.580 --> 1:19:04.860]  The federal government commissioned secret radiation experiments on thousands of non-consenting
[1:19:04.860 --> 1:19:11.020]  patients, hundreds of hospitals in the U.S. injected healthy men, women and children with
[1:19:11.020 --> 1:19:17.340]  uranium and plutonium at dosage levels ranging from non-therapeutic to lethal, killing many
[1:19:17.340 --> 1:19:19.340]  of the test subjects.
[1:19:19.340 --> 1:19:23.540]  In-game blueprint for global enslavement is one of the most important films ever made.
[1:19:23.540 --> 1:19:27.260]  Fourteen years ago, we tracked and documented the Bilderberg group's activities and their
[1:19:27.260 --> 1:19:30.580]  plan for a great reset using the threat of a fake virus.
[1:19:30.580 --> 1:19:32.140]  The film now is more important than ever.
[1:19:32.140 --> 1:19:35.060]  When it shot to number one on Amazon last year, they banned it.
[1:19:35.060 --> 1:19:39.140]  We have it back in print available now at infowarstore.com.
[1:19:39.140 --> 1:19:43.220]  Selling them as low as $3.95 a piece with a bottom and bulk and there's a zero country

[1:20:01.820 --> 1:20:13.180]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:20:13.180 --> 1:20:15.780]  Waging war on corruption.
[1:20:15.780 --> 1:20:23.500]  Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war and now your host, Owen
[1:20:23.500 --> 1:20:24.500]  Troyer.
[1:20:24.500 --> 1:20:29.460]  How do you like those astronomically high gas prices?
[1:20:29.460 --> 1:20:32.140]  You can thank Joe Biden for that.
[1:20:32.140 --> 1:20:37.740]  And soon the cost of a cheeseburger will be astronomically high as well.
[1:20:37.740 --> 1:20:39.860]  Welcome back into the Alex Jones Show.
[1:20:39.860 --> 1:20:40.860]  Owen Troyer here.
[1:20:40.860 --> 1:20:41.860]  I'm going to do a news blitz.
[1:20:41.860 --> 1:20:46.060]  If I can get through all the news in this segment, I'll open up the phone lines.
[1:20:46.060 --> 1:20:56.300]  But yes, ladies and gentlemen, Joe Biden, of course, at the behest of China, at the behest
[1:20:56.300 --> 1:21:06.580]  of the new world order, it doesn't want you to be free and prosperous and eat red meat.
[1:21:06.580 --> 1:21:10.420]  According to a study done at the University of Michigan, Joe Biden's climate plan would
[1:21:10.420 --> 1:21:16.740]  force Americans to reduce their red meat consumption by 90%, meaning that they can only consume
[1:21:16.740 --> 1:21:24.420]  four pounds of red meat per year or one burger a month.
[1:21:24.420 --> 1:21:27.180]  That wouldn't really be the equivalent for me.
[1:21:27.180 --> 1:21:28.940]  I like big cheeseburgers.
[1:21:28.940 --> 1:21:35.700]  Of course, the irony is, remember, Joe Biden had the president of Japan over for a cheeseburger
[1:21:35.700 --> 1:21:37.420]  dinner.
[1:21:37.420 --> 1:21:46.100]  Remember that one, and just two years ago, or three years ago now, excuse me, on Politico.
[1:21:46.100 --> 1:21:51.300]  Remember the old story they made fun of us saying, we're not coming for your cheeseburgers?
[1:21:51.300 --> 1:21:56.460]  The headline, why right ringers are going crazy about meat?
[1:21:56.460 --> 1:21:57.460]  Conservatives are panicking.
[1:21:57.460 --> 1:22:00.740]  Liberals are going to take away their stakes after grabbing guns.
[1:22:00.740 --> 1:22:05.100]  The fear is pushing people to absurd lengths to prove how free they are, except now here
[1:22:05.100 --> 1:22:12.300]  you are coming for our guns and our red meat, so your gas prices go up, your cheeseburger
[1:22:12.300 --> 1:22:18.020]  prices go up, your lumber prices go up, your energy prices go up, all thanks to Biden capitulating
[1:22:18.020 --> 1:22:22.020]  to the new world order where the United States is not allowed to be free and prosperous.
[1:22:22.020 --> 1:22:27.340]  We're not allowed to have a free market, and that's really all it is.
[1:22:27.340 --> 1:22:29.340]  They want a global government.
[1:22:29.340 --> 1:22:31.940]  You cannot have a free market.
[1:22:31.940 --> 1:22:35.460]  You cannot have a prosperous, dominant United States of America.
[1:22:35.460 --> 1:22:36.860]  You cannot have that.
[1:22:36.860 --> 1:22:44.100]  That then leads the world, and then you don't get a global government because the very principles
[1:22:44.100 --> 1:22:48.740]  of the United States of American government, political system, is small government.
[1:22:48.740 --> 1:22:55.140]  We've lost our way, but small government, self-government, that revolutionary idea that
[1:22:55.140 --> 1:22:57.420]  the Democrats hate so much.
[1:22:57.420 --> 1:23:07.700]  Self-government, self-government, and so here's what it's going to look like.
[1:23:07.700 --> 1:23:11.100]  In Los Angeles, they have just built a homeless encampment.
[1:23:11.100 --> 1:23:13.980]  Now you've seen the tent cities popping up.
[1:23:13.980 --> 1:23:18.860]  You've even seen now government subsidized tent cities in places like Portland.
[1:23:18.860 --> 1:23:20.780]  Now it's gone next level.
[1:23:20.780 --> 1:23:25.860]  A large homeless encampment along the 101 Freeway in North Hollywood is now a colorful
[1:23:25.860 --> 1:23:29.900]  village of tiny homes for the homeless.
[1:23:29.900 --> 1:23:33.940]  They get these tiny homes constructed for them.
[1:23:33.940 --> 1:23:39.300]  They get government subsidized hotel rooms paid for by them.
[1:23:39.300 --> 1:23:43.100]  By the way, we also have to pay for the illegal immigrants as well.
[1:23:43.100 --> 1:23:45.740]  This is a socialist country now.
[1:23:45.740 --> 1:23:48.580]  This is a socialist country now.
[1:23:48.580 --> 1:23:52.620]  That's what it looks like under Agenda 21.
[1:23:52.620 --> 1:23:58.380]  This story was from January 9th, 2015, the headline Agenda 21 is real far creepier than
[1:23:58.380 --> 1:24:01.300]  Area 51 and it's coming soon to a suburb near you.
[1:24:01.300 --> 1:24:02.300]  This is it.
[1:24:02.300 --> 1:24:04.700]  This is it.
[1:24:04.700 --> 1:24:12.820]  Government lockdowns, open borders, homeless encampments all over because you'll be homeless
[1:24:12.820 --> 1:24:13.820]  too.
[1:24:13.820 --> 1:24:14.940]  You'll own nothing.
[1:24:14.940 --> 1:24:21.420]  The New World Order tells you you'll be a slave, but you'll like it.
[1:24:21.420 --> 1:24:25.580]  Immigration, Biden administration to increase number of illegals released into the United
[1:24:25.580 --> 1:24:26.580]  States by 800%.
[1:24:26.580 --> 1:24:30.860]  Of course, that's just the numbers that we know of.
[1:24:30.860 --> 1:24:36.420]  That doesn't even count the ones that don't get caught in process and then they'll end
[1:24:36.420 --> 1:24:44.700]  up in many of them in the cities like that one in LA, the homeless facilities.
[1:24:44.700 --> 1:24:48.340]  The Democrat Party's gone full racist, by the way, in case you haven't noticed, they've
[1:24:48.340 --> 1:24:50.220]  gone full racist now.
[1:24:50.220 --> 1:24:54.060]  They're not even hiding their racism and they like Jim Crow laws.
[1:24:54.060 --> 1:24:57.300]  Of course, it was the Democrats that wrote the Jim Crow laws, so they're bringing Jim
[1:24:57.300 --> 1:24:58.300]  Crow laws back.
[1:24:58.300 --> 1:24:59.620]  That's the Democrat Party.
[1:24:59.620 --> 1:25:04.540]  This is seen at the Madison Metropolitan School District.
[1:25:04.540 --> 1:25:06.980]  This is in Wisconsin.
[1:25:06.980 --> 1:25:15.140]  They had a Zoom meeting for parents and at the bottom here, they have links.
[1:25:15.140 --> 1:25:18.100]  You click the link, you go to the Zoom meeting, they had two different links.
[1:25:18.100 --> 1:25:19.460]  You think two different links?
[1:25:19.460 --> 1:25:20.740]  Well, one link should be fine.
[1:25:20.740 --> 1:25:22.900]  No, see, two different links.
[1:25:22.900 --> 1:25:28.140]  Zoom link for parents of color and Zoom link for white parents.
[1:25:28.140 --> 1:25:38.300]  I used to read books about this stuff for whites only or at the time they had the colored
[1:25:38.300 --> 1:25:40.580]  people, water fountains.
[1:25:40.580 --> 1:25:41.580]  Remember that?
[1:25:41.580 --> 1:25:43.620]  The Democrats did that with Jim Crow laws.
[1:25:43.620 --> 1:25:44.620]  They wrote those.
[1:25:44.620 --> 1:25:50.820]  The Democrats founded by the leftovers of the KKK, now they're bringing it back, folks,
[1:25:50.820 --> 1:25:56.060]  and they have separate Zoom meetings for parents of color and for white parents.
[1:25:56.060 --> 1:26:02.340]  Now, see, if they would be honest about this, they'd just say, no, we want to be racist
[1:26:02.340 --> 1:26:06.580]  against white people because there was racism against black people in America, so now we're
[1:26:06.580 --> 1:26:08.220]  just going to be racist against white people.
[1:26:08.220 --> 1:26:11.740]  Of course, that's the complete opposite of what Martin Luther King's dream was, but
[1:26:11.740 --> 1:26:15.620]  that's what they really are doing.
[1:26:15.620 --> 1:26:19.500]  That's what they're really doing, and they're not the only people.
[1:26:19.500 --> 1:26:25.940]  There's a month old headline that just covers the story of universities posting different
[1:26:25.940 --> 1:26:30.820]  graduation ceremonies for gay people and different skin colors and income levels and
[1:26:30.820 --> 1:26:31.820]  all this.
[1:26:31.820 --> 1:26:33.620]  So this is the left, okay?
[1:26:33.620 --> 1:26:39.820]  This is the segregationist movement once again brought on by the left, the Democrats.
[1:26:39.820 --> 1:26:44.100]  Here's the leading newspaper of the left, New York Times.
[1:26:44.100 --> 1:26:50.460]  Whiteness is a suicide cult, blackness is a superpower.
[1:26:50.460 --> 1:26:55.820]  That is a literal headline from the New York Times.
[1:26:55.820 --> 1:26:56.820]  So there you go.
[1:26:56.820 --> 1:26:58.460]  Again, who are the real racists?
[1:26:58.460 --> 1:27:01.980]  They don't even see their own irony.
[1:27:01.980 --> 1:27:06.820]  Black-owned businesses in George Floyd Square say they are in desperate need of help from
[1:27:06.820 --> 1:27:08.100]  the police.
[1:27:08.100 --> 1:27:12.860]  The businesses are struggling to stay open due to rampant crime.
[1:27:12.860 --> 1:27:18.380]  So you have white liberals that are racist, that are out there with Black Lives Matter.
[1:27:18.380 --> 1:27:24.460]  Then you have black criminals that are just criminals who are robbing and looting businesses
[1:27:24.460 --> 1:27:28.020]  in the name and the cover of Black Lives Matter.
[1:27:28.020 --> 1:27:31.580]  And it's black business owners that are suffering the most from it in Atlanta where they move
[1:27:31.580 --> 1:27:34.500]  the All-Star Game because of racism.
[1:27:34.500 --> 1:27:40.540]  And now in George Floyd Square where the white people aren't allowed to talk, did you know
[1:27:40.540 --> 1:27:41.540]  that?
[1:27:41.540 --> 1:27:44.500]  Yeah, these are the liberal Democrats that are so racist.
[1:27:44.500 --> 1:27:46.700]  They have a sign up for white people, you're not allowed to talk.
[1:27:46.700 --> 1:27:49.340]  And of course, this is all supported by Big Tech.
[1:27:49.340 --> 1:27:56.300]  Twitter, Facebook, and Netflix moguls have donated $7.5 million to the BLM co-founder
[1:27:56.300 --> 1:27:58.340]  who is pushing their net neutrality policy.
[1:27:58.340 --> 1:27:59.660]  So that's how that works.
[1:27:59.660 --> 1:28:04.940]  So the Black Lives Matter leaders, not the family of George Floyd or Michael Brown or
[1:28:04.940 --> 1:28:07.020]  the others, they're asking where their money is.
[1:28:07.020 --> 1:28:08.460]  The family is a Breonna Taylor.
[1:28:08.460 --> 1:28:10.460]  They're saying, how come BLM scammed us?
[1:28:10.460 --> 1:28:13.380]  They didn't pay us anything because it's all about free handouts.
[1:28:13.380 --> 1:28:17.980]  That's how free citizen is getting free handouts from the government that controls you.
[1:28:17.980 --> 1:28:27.100]  And so the BLM founders, quote unquote, they have big luxurious mansions now and they get
[1:28:27.100 --> 1:28:34.700]  paid off to promote big tech agendas.
[1:28:34.700 --> 1:28:35.700]  That's how it works.
[1:28:35.700 --> 1:28:38.740]  So they have to pay influencers to promote their big tech agendas.
[1:28:38.740 --> 1:28:45.860]  They have to pay influencers to promote their medical tyranny agendas with the forced vaccines.
[1:28:45.860 --> 1:28:47.740]  That's what these people are into.
[1:28:47.740 --> 1:28:53.260]  I think we'll take some phone calls here as we close out the Alex Jones show in the next
[1:28:53.260 --> 1:28:54.260]  two segments.
[1:28:54.260 --> 1:28:58.260]  We'll put it up on the other side.
[1:28:58.260 --> 1:29:00.820]  Actually bought this at Blocks, UHF frequency.
[1:29:00.820 --> 1:29:06.900]  Snowden and others taught us how mobile phones are constantly spying on us, not just tracking
[1:29:06.900 --> 1:29:13.980]  and recording our GPS location, but recording audio and video as well, with or without a
[1:29:13.980 --> 1:29:15.340]  battery.
[1:29:15.340 --> 1:29:21.260]  Now with the Info Wars privacy pouch, you can go dark wherever you choose.
[1:29:21.260 --> 1:29:22.260]  Excellent.
[1:29:22.260 --> 1:29:27.940]  Now I have my own compact Faraday cage I can take wherever I want.
[1:29:27.940 --> 1:29:32.820]  And you can too at infowarstore.com.
[1:29:32.820 --> 1:29:40.060]  Government agencies, identity thieves, tech giants, and now contact tracers are all tracking
[1:29:40.060 --> 1:29:43.260]  your every move through your mobile phone.
[1:29:43.260 --> 1:29:48.540]  Now you can have the power to easily cut them off and go dark.
[1:29:48.540 --> 1:29:58.860]  The Info War, and get your Info Wars privacy pouch today, infowarstore.com.
[1:29:58.860 --> 1:30:01.660]  The equation is very simple.
[1:30:01.660 --> 1:30:08.260]  The mega banks control the media, they control big pharma, they control academia, they control
[1:30:08.260 --> 1:30:12.420]  the military, industrial complex, they control big tech.
[1:30:12.420 --> 1:30:17.860]  And everywhere that they have been in control in the third world they have established absolute
[1:30:17.860 --> 1:30:20.540]  total despotism and dehumanization.
[1:30:20.540 --> 1:30:27.100]  It is the western Christian idea of human freedom that ended slavery and that promoted
[1:30:27.100 --> 1:30:30.020]  women's rights and so much more that actually threatens them.
[1:30:30.020 --> 1:30:35.540]  So because they can't defeat that empowering ethic, they instead co-opted, turn it upside
[1:30:35.540 --> 1:30:43.060]  down and use the idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom and the free market
[1:30:43.060 --> 1:30:45.820]  that threatens their monopoly sub control.
[1:30:45.820 --> 1:30:49.820]  That's why they target Info Wars, because we understand the keys to defeating them.
[1:30:49.820 --> 1:30:54.740]  But the only way our transmission gets out is if you promote Info Wars and band off any
[1:30:54.740 --> 1:30:55.740]  other.
[1:30:55.740 --> 1:30:56.740]  So redouble your efforts.
[1:30:56.740 --> 1:30:57.740]  We're all in this together.
[1:30:57.740 --> 1:31:04.700]  One of the most popular memes on the Internet in the last decade has been, Alex Jones was
[1:31:04.700 --> 1:31:10.980]  right, but it now routinely trends number one on platforms like Twitter and Facebook,
[1:31:10.980 --> 1:31:13.860]  making the globalists pull their hair out in anger.
[1:31:13.860 --> 1:31:17.380]  Well, let me tell you, we are tomorrow's news today and thanks for your support.
[1:31:17.380 --> 1:31:21.420]  We're still on air at infowars.com and band off video radio stations and TV stations
[1:31:21.420 --> 1:31:22.420]  across the country.
[1:31:22.420 --> 1:31:26.620]  And our film Endgame, censored and taken offline by Amazon when it hit number one a few years
[1:31:26.620 --> 1:31:28.620]  ago, is now available again.
[1:31:28.620 --> 1:31:33.300]  We have reprinted it on high quality DVD, in HD, it has a zero country code, any one
[1:31:33.300 --> 1:31:37.100]  in the world is authorized to make copies of it and I'm asking you to get the original,
[1:31:37.100 --> 1:31:40.300]  make copies, give it to everyone you know, air it on local access TV, give it to your
[1:31:40.300 --> 1:31:44.140]  pastors, your police chiefs, your state reps, your prime ministers, whatever you do, warn
[1:31:44.140 --> 1:31:45.140]  the world.
[1:31:45.140 --> 1:31:49.580]  This film uses their own documents and those statements 14 years ago to expose them.
[1:31:49.580 --> 1:31:54.420]  It's more important than ever available at infowarstore.com, that's infowarstore.com,
[1:31:54.420 --> 1:31:59.060]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[1:31:59.060 --> 1:32:04.020]  Last week I had a caller to my radio slash TV transmission and he said to me, he said,
[1:32:04.020 --> 1:32:08.460]  Alex, there's all these facts and all these numbers and vaccines being recalled and people
[1:32:08.460 --> 1:32:12.940]  dying from it and people getting sick, how do I reach out to my friends and family and
[1:32:12.940 --> 1:32:18.500]  explain to them and to warn them about the danger and I said to him something very profound
[1:32:18.500 --> 1:32:23.020]  because it's so true, trust your gut, trust your spirit with the Bible tells us and I
[1:32:23.020 --> 1:32:28.940]  said ask those friends, those family, those neighbors, do you feel good about this vaccine
[1:32:28.940 --> 1:32:31.140]  and his answer was no, they don't feel good about it.
[1:32:31.140 --> 1:32:35.980]  So go with your gut, well let me ask you again, how does your gut feel about getting
[1:32:35.980 --> 1:32:39.660]  out of the storeable food, how's your gut feel about getting out in the countryside,
[1:32:39.660 --> 1:32:43.300]  how's your gut feel about getting guns and ammo to protect yourself, well I know what
[1:32:43.300 --> 1:32:46.820]  your gut's telling you, we have the best storeable food with the highest quality at
[1:32:46.820 --> 1:32:53.980]  the lowest prices you're going to find, 10% off at infowarstore.com right now or for Parodialics.com.
[1:32:53.980 --> 1:33:01.260]  Go with your gut and find the info war, infowarstore.com.
[1:33:01.260 --> 1:33:19.660]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:19.660 --> 1:33:27.820]  You want to stop tyranny, well so does he, it's Alex Jones and now your host Owen Troyer.
[1:33:27.820 --> 1:33:35.180]  I'm going to give out the phone number now, I've got a couple segments left to take your
[1:33:35.180 --> 1:33:47.700]  phone calls, 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539, I've got two segments left here of the Alex Jones
[1:33:47.700 --> 1:33:50.860]  show on this Sunday and then Harrison Smith will be hosting Sunday Night Live, he doesn't
[1:33:50.860 --> 1:33:54.460]  have any guests so he may be taking calls as well, I know he's got a lot of news he's
[1:33:54.460 --> 1:33:59.500]  going to cover, but we'll start getting your phone calls lined up here as I finish some
[1:33:59.500 --> 1:34:07.940]  of this other news, Gina Carano, she is the former MMA fighter and she was the actress
[1:34:07.940 --> 1:34:15.420]  in the popular show Mandalorian that then got removed from her duties because she's
[1:34:15.420 --> 1:34:18.620]  not a liberal.
[1:34:18.620 --> 1:34:23.220]  Statement of the day from Gina Carano, you want to start improving your health, stop
[1:34:23.220 --> 1:34:34.860]  being so full of she, I, it, I think that pretty much sums it up, you want to start
[1:34:34.860 --> 1:34:40.740]  improving your health, stop being so full of she, I, it and of course feels like that
[1:34:40.740 --> 1:34:48.140]  was directed to the liberal progressive left in this country, a couple of their headlines
[1:34:48.140 --> 1:34:53.420]  here, Trump demands National Guard in Arizona as legal action continues against Maricopa
[1:34:53.420 --> 1:34:59.460]  audit, yes the Democrats doing everything they can to try to stop that audit, what are
[1:34:59.460 --> 1:35:07.060]  they so afraid of and of course the viral photos that have people going bananas, a lot
[1:35:07.060 --> 1:35:14.140]  of people wondering if it might have something to do with a certain guest of Info Wars named
[1:35:14.140 --> 1:35:24.460]  Steve Pacinac and they are doing black light scanning of all the ballots, so is that one
[1:35:24.460 --> 1:35:29.660]  way to see what ballots are real and which ones are fake, perhaps time will tell, never
[1:35:29.660 --> 1:35:33.460]  before seen photos show Bill Clinton greeting sex offender Jeffrey Epstein in White House
[1:35:33.460 --> 1:35:40.100]  and actually it's not just Clinton greeting Epstein, also greeting Maxwell, that case
[1:35:40.100 --> 1:35:47.380]  is ongoing, new charges have been filed, trafficking of minors, again that's Epstein and Maxwell,
[1:35:47.380 --> 1:35:52.660]  no big media coverage on that though, everything is about George Floyd or a police officer
[1:35:52.660 --> 1:36:00.500]  but you know the industrial level sex trafficking, the industrial level sex abuse that involved
[1:36:00.500 --> 1:36:06.900]  presidents of the United States, no big deal because well Bill Clinton was a Democrat,
[1:36:06.900 --> 1:36:11.900]  so as long as you're a Democrat you can get away with anything.
[1:36:11.900 --> 1:36:19.580]  Here's another example, Michigan Democratic representative gets pulled over for drunk
[1:36:19.580 --> 1:36:25.380]  driving, he drove his car into a ditch, it was that bad, he drove his car into a ditch
[1:36:25.380 --> 1:36:30.980]  and then he starts threatening the officers, I'm telling you it's not going to be good
[1:36:30.980 --> 1:36:37.500]  for you, I run y'all's budget bro, said Joel Jones, 26 years old after drunkenly crashing
[1:36:37.500 --> 1:36:45.500]  his car into a ditch, he then threatened to call Governor Whitmer on the cops, wow, I
[1:36:45.500 --> 1:36:51.340]  guess he knows Whitmer's a dirty dealer too, so threatened to call her to stop himself
[1:36:51.340 --> 1:36:56.540]  from getting a DUI and of course was cursing, threatening the officers saying he was going
[1:36:56.540 --> 1:37:04.700]  to have him all fired and everything, it's a better idea to just cooperate with the police
[1:37:04.700 --> 1:37:11.380]  when you drive your car into a ditch but see he's a good Democrat, he's feeling empowered
[1:37:11.380 --> 1:37:16.660]  and so he threatens the officers, Canadian police return with SWAT team to local church
[1:37:16.660 --> 1:37:25.020]  run by Arthur Polowski, that was the powerful pastor who told off the health officials multiple
[1:37:25.020 --> 1:37:32.020]  times get out, get out, you may remember that video and so now they show up with SWAT teams
[1:37:32.020 --> 1:37:42.060]  because you know freedom is illegal and going to church is a crime now, wow and then here's
[1:37:42.060 --> 1:37:49.540]  a twist, roofing company offers a free AR-15 with a new roof, this is sending liberals
[1:37:49.540 --> 1:37:54.940]  out of control, a roofing company in Wyoming is giving away a free AR-15 rifle with the
[1:37:54.940 --> 1:37:59.620]  purchase of a new roof of spectacular offer that has let this freaking out, the stories
[1:37:59.620 --> 1:38:05.380]  at Infowars.com, Matt Thomas, marketing director for Wiggins Construction in Powell, Wyoming
[1:38:05.380 --> 1:38:10.860]  said he came up with the idea after noticing people moving into the state in droves from
[1:38:10.860 --> 1:38:19.780]  California, I have a feeling that is going to be a good marketing campaign for that roofing
[1:38:19.780 --> 1:38:28.060]  company, I have a feeling, all right, let's go to the phone lines and we have Ken dialed
[1:38:28.060 --> 1:38:33.180]  in from Oklahoma, Ken wants to talk about the Black Lives Matter protest happening
[1:38:33.180 --> 1:38:34.660]  in Oklahoma, go ahead Ken.
[1:38:34.660 --> 1:38:40.060]  Hey Owen, thanks for taking my call, there was going to be a protest that was talked
[1:38:40.060 --> 1:38:46.700]  about on Harrison Show Friday and the protest was for this weekend, it was going to be Friday
[1:38:46.700 --> 1:38:50.740]  night and they canceled it and I guess we had rain come through which is a good thing
[1:38:50.740 --> 1:38:55.340]  but I guess they're trying to get motivated for this white silences violence march that
[1:38:55.340 --> 1:38:59.900]  they're trying to do in some of the upper class neighborhoods here in Oklahoma City.
[1:38:59.900 --> 1:39:01.460]  White silence is violence?
[1:39:01.460 --> 1:39:03.300]  Yeah, white silence is violence.
[1:39:03.300 --> 1:39:07.540]  So first they have signs in George Floyd Square that say whitey isn't allowed to talk but
[1:39:07.540 --> 1:39:11.820]  also white silence is violence, boy Ken, I don't know, I feel like I'm screwed on this
[1:39:11.820 --> 1:39:12.820]  deal.
[1:39:12.820 --> 1:39:16.060]  Yeah, right, if you're in George Floyd Square and you're not talking, you're violent and
[1:39:16.060 --> 1:39:17.740]  they're probably going to turn on you.
[1:39:17.740 --> 1:39:20.700]  But also they tell you you're not allowed to talk if you're white, I feel like I'm getting
[1:39:20.700 --> 1:39:21.700]  set up.
[1:39:21.700 --> 1:39:25.860]  Exactly, that's what it is and you know, none of the news, see I want to thank you guys
[1:39:25.860 --> 1:39:31.180]  at InfoWarsU and everybody else that brought this out on Wednesday that the BLM had actually
[1:39:31.180 --> 1:39:35.220]  gone into the Oklahoma Capitol because I'm here in Oklahoma and I didn't even hear about
[1:39:35.220 --> 1:39:36.220]  it.
[1:39:36.220 --> 1:39:41.540]  That story, I'm glad you even re-brought that up because I mean, we're just like berserkers
[1:39:41.540 --> 1:39:46.340]  charging in trench warfare, like I don't have time to turn around and look at the spoils
[1:39:46.340 --> 1:39:49.660]  of war or the lament or anything.
[1:39:49.660 --> 1:39:53.420]  That never got any mainstream coverage, Ken, literally, zero.
[1:39:53.420 --> 1:39:59.500]  It did get a little bit of mainstream coverage in articles online, Fox News put out something
[1:39:59.500 --> 1:40:04.340]  about it, a couple other people talked about it, but it was only national mainstream coverage.
[1:40:04.340 --> 1:40:09.460]  None of the local news agencies in Oklahoma covered it at all and there's one talking
[1:40:09.460 --> 1:40:15.540]  head on Twitter, Dylan Richards, who works for KOCO, which is News Channel 5 in Oklahoma
[1:40:15.540 --> 1:40:16.540]  City.
[1:40:16.540 --> 1:40:20.340]  He put up a couple tweets about it and he just whitewashed it as in it, they didn't really
[1:40:20.340 --> 1:40:22.860]  break in and there wasn't really a lockdown.
[1:40:22.860 --> 1:40:26.660]  Everything he said about it online was just worshiping BLM to make it look like whatever
[1:40:26.660 --> 1:40:33.260]  they did was good and justified, where old ladies are going into the state, the federal
[1:40:33.260 --> 1:40:36.100]  capital and whenever they're walking through the lines and they're carrying a flag, they're
[1:40:36.100 --> 1:40:38.660]  going to go to jail and they're political prisoners.
[1:40:38.660 --> 1:40:42.300]  It's completely insane that they're going to put political prisoners, lock them up and
[1:40:42.300 --> 1:40:44.460]  these people are just going to walk free and do whatever they want.
[1:40:44.460 --> 1:40:46.220]  Well, yeah, they're Democrats.
[1:40:46.220 --> 1:40:50.020]  Don't you know Democrats don't have the same justice, don't have the same court of laws
[1:40:50.020 --> 1:40:53.300]  that other people have, right?
[1:40:53.300 --> 1:40:54.860]  So that's how that goes.
[1:40:54.860 --> 1:40:58.540]  I mean, as it is, these people are going to continue to do this and continue to get worse.
[1:40:58.540 --> 1:40:59.540]  Oh, sure.
[1:40:59.540 --> 1:41:02.340]  And they'll get up on your dinner table and you'll kick your food over and say you're
[1:41:02.340 --> 1:41:06.380]  not welcome here and cause the business owners a bunch of business and they just think it's
[1:41:06.380 --> 1:41:07.380]  all great.
[1:41:07.380 --> 1:41:08.380]  These are not bright people.
[1:41:08.380 --> 1:41:10.060]  They're a threat to themselves and everyone around them.
[1:41:10.060 --> 1:41:11.780]  Ken, thank you so much for the call.
[1:41:11.780 --> 1:41:14.180]  Let's go to Kevin in New York City.
[1:41:14.180 --> 1:41:16.740]  Kevin, you are on the Alex Jones show this Sunday.
[1:41:16.740 --> 1:41:17.740]  Go ahead.
[1:41:17.740 --> 1:41:19.700]  Oh, and how are you brother?
[1:41:19.700 --> 1:41:20.700]  Good.
[1:41:20.700 --> 1:41:22.220]  I'm just checking in with you.
[1:41:22.220 --> 1:41:29.740]  So I'm doing a lot of real estate in New York City and the weird thing is between the
[1:41:29.740 --> 1:41:34.220]  virtue signaling with people saying, oh, I got the vaccine, did you get the vaccine?
[1:41:34.220 --> 1:41:38.460]  But another thing is that he's hearing people saying that their kids have gotten sick now
[1:41:38.460 --> 1:41:42.260]  and that their kids are suffering like long term, a sex a year later.
[1:41:42.260 --> 1:41:46.540]  So if you tell them it's a virtue signaling now about how sick they've gotten with the
[1:41:46.540 --> 1:41:47.540]  coronavirus.
[1:41:47.540 --> 1:41:49.020]  Oh, it's a victim economy.
[1:41:49.020 --> 1:41:50.020]  Everyone's a victim.
[1:41:50.020 --> 1:41:51.020]  Yeah.
[1:41:51.020 --> 1:41:52.020]  It's getting out of control.
[1:41:52.020 --> 1:41:56.420]  You know, and I people texting me before we do a showing for an apartment and they're
[1:41:56.420 --> 1:42:00.340]  like, have you gotten vaccinated and that comes to be the question again.
[1:42:00.340 --> 1:42:02.140]  Yeah, they want to know my medical information.
[1:42:02.140 --> 1:42:03.580]  Yeah, like you can't even do it.
[1:42:03.580 --> 1:42:07.740]  So you, the people who harass you, you're just trying to show them a piece of property
[1:42:07.740 --> 1:42:09.740]  and they harass you for your medical history.
[1:42:09.740 --> 1:42:10.740]  Right.
[1:42:10.740 --> 1:42:11.740]  Definitely.
[1:42:11.740 --> 1:42:13.740]  And I'm trying to think of what ailments that should come up with to tell them.
[1:42:13.740 --> 1:42:14.740]  Yeah.
[1:42:14.740 --> 1:42:15.740]  And that's all I got.
[1:42:15.740 --> 1:42:16.740]  I just want to say hello.
[1:42:16.740 --> 1:42:20.340]  All right, Kevin, thank you so much for the call.
[1:42:20.340 --> 1:42:21.340]  All right.
[1:42:21.340 --> 1:42:22.860]  I'm going to keep taking calls on the other side.
[1:42:22.860 --> 1:42:23.860]  I got one segment left.
[1:42:23.860 --> 1:42:26.540]  And then it's Harrison Smith, he's loaded.
[1:42:26.540 --> 1:42:27.540]  He's got a bunch of news.
[1:42:27.540 --> 1:42:29.340]  He's going to break down as well.
[1:42:29.340 --> 1:42:32.780]  Remember folks, infowarstore.com.
[1:42:32.780 --> 1:42:35.900]  Do not take info wars for granted, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:42:35.900 --> 1:42:38.340]  Do not take these broadcasts for granted.
[1:42:38.340 --> 1:42:40.580]  Do not take band.video for granted.
[1:42:40.580 --> 1:42:43.580]  Do not take this crew for granted.
[1:42:43.580 --> 1:42:46.860]  We're here because you support by shopping at infowarstore.com.
[1:42:46.860 --> 1:42:49.580]  You still have big sales happening, by the way.
[1:42:49.580 --> 1:42:54.460]  These will be complete back in stock, 50% off, shoppinginfowarstore.com.
[1:42:54.460 --> 1:42:58.740]  Keep us on air.
[1:42:58.740 --> 1:43:01.740]  I 1 trillion percent believe what I'm saying.
[1:43:01.740 --> 1:43:03.540]  Hell, everybody knows that.
[1:43:03.540 --> 1:43:05.020]  I just tell you what I'm really thinking.
[1:43:05.020 --> 1:43:07.420]  People say, well, Jones, why the hell did you just say that on air?
[1:43:07.420 --> 1:43:08.420]  That's embarrassing.
[1:43:08.420 --> 1:43:11.140]  Well, I'm not going to stop with only the good stuff about me.
[1:43:11.140 --> 1:43:13.420]  But I'll tell you this right now.
[1:43:13.420 --> 1:43:15.820]  You're nuts if you don't get storeable food.
[1:43:15.820 --> 1:43:20.020]  When I've got the biggest best sponsor with the highest quality food at the lowest price
[1:43:20.020 --> 1:43:24.460]  you're going to find, can you spend triple or four times it and get gourmet stuff that
[1:43:24.460 --> 1:43:25.460]  tastes even better?
[1:43:25.460 --> 1:43:26.460]  Yeah.
[1:43:26.460 --> 1:43:27.460]  Most of this stuff tastes amazing.
[1:43:27.460 --> 1:43:28.460]  Some of it tastes okay.
[1:43:28.460 --> 1:43:32.380]  The point is, it's high quality, it's nutritious, and it lasts a long time.
[1:43:32.380 --> 1:43:35.860]  And compared to other competitors, they can't even get close.
[1:43:35.860 --> 1:43:37.420]  We've got three months, six months.
[1:43:37.420 --> 1:43:43.100]  Your supplies right now, and I twisted their arms so hard to give you 10% off again because
[1:43:43.100 --> 1:43:50.340]  you're so conditionally buying under Supercell, we're doing it one more time, infowarstore.com,

[1:43:56.420 --> 1:43:57.420]  still can.
[1:43:57.420 --> 1:44:03.420]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April, 2021, and I just want to say something.
[1:44:03.420 --> 1:44:07.780]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over
[1:44:07.780 --> 1:44:12.100]  the years and has truly been answered a prayer, and I am so blessed and thankful for all of
[1:44:12.100 --> 1:44:13.100]  you, the listeners of this show.
[1:44:13.100 --> 1:44:17.660]  I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you, whether you are old, whether you are
[1:44:17.660 --> 1:44:21.500]  Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter you've got red blood, and if you love freedom
[1:44:21.500 --> 1:44:26.580]  and justice, and if you love our innocent children, we are brothers and sisters together,
[1:44:26.580 --> 1:44:30.740]  and it has just been an incredible experience to work with you over the years.
[1:44:30.740 --> 1:44:34.460]  And as crazy as your things are, I want to keep working under the future.
[1:44:34.460 --> 1:44:37.980]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[1:44:37.980 --> 1:44:42.580]  Well, please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support
[1:44:42.580 --> 1:44:43.580]  us.
[1:44:43.580 --> 1:44:45.380]  But again, that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[1:44:45.380 --> 1:44:48.980]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've
[1:44:48.980 --> 1:44:54.140]  done, and just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you, and
[1:44:54.140 --> 1:44:56.980]  hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support Him for worse.
[1:44:56.980 --> 1:44:57.980]  God bless.
[1:44:57.980 --> 1:45:05.540]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[1:45:05.540 --> 1:45:10.340]  From the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[1:45:10.340 --> 1:45:12.660]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[1:45:12.660 --> 1:45:16.180]  Could their objective be world domination?
[1:45:16.180 --> 1:45:19.460]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[1:45:19.460 --> 1:45:24.500]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating
[1:45:24.500 --> 1:45:27.620]  80% of humanity is at hand.
[1:45:27.620 --> 1:45:30.220]  The globalist fear this film made 14 years ago.
[1:45:30.220 --> 1:45:32.500]  It is the blueprint for their plan to take over the world.
[1:45:32.500 --> 1:45:33.940]  It is the blueprint for the great reset.
[1:45:33.940 --> 1:45:34.940]  It is in game.
[1:45:34.940 --> 1:45:38.820]  It is the blueprint for global enslavement, available right now at infowarstore.com with
[1:45:38.820 --> 1:45:42.180]  a zero country code meaning you can make copies of it anywhere in the world.
[1:45:42.180 --> 1:45:46.380]  I strongly suggest you get the film in game at infowarstore.com.
[1:45:46.380 --> 1:45:50.660]  I strongly suggest you make copies and share it, and if you take that action, I demand
[1:45:50.660 --> 1:45:54.180]  you tell others you've given a copy too, that they make copies and share it as well.
[1:45:54.180 --> 1:45:59.340]  That will trigger distribution by proxy, meaning we the people cannot be stopped.
[1:45:59.340 --> 1:46:02.700]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[1:46:02.700 --> 1:46:07.040]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[1:46:07.040 --> 1:46:11.740]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them
[1:46:11.740 --> 1:46:16.260]  a bottle of ultimate fish oil from infowarstore.com.
[1:46:16.260 --> 1:46:21.060]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower
[1:46:21.060 --> 1:46:26.780]  blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide
[1:46:26.780 --> 1:46:32.580]  a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[1:46:32.580 --> 1:46:39.420]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function
[1:46:39.420 --> 1:46:44.020]  by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[1:46:44.020 --> 1:46:49.940]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual
[1:46:49.940 --> 1:46:52.620]  facts that pertain to reality.
[1:46:52.620 --> 1:47:02.340]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at infowarstore.com.
[1:47:02.340 --> 1:47:17.660]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:47:17.660 --> 1:47:25.460]  Live from the infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show, and now
[1:47:25.460 --> 1:47:30.420]  your host, Owen Shroyer.
[1:47:30.420 --> 1:47:34.220]  For closing out the Alex Jones Show today with your phone calls, Harrison Smith takes
[1:47:34.220 --> 1:47:35.220]  over.
[1:47:35.220 --> 1:47:40.700]  He hosts Sunday Night Live in T-minus 13 minutes.
[1:47:40.700 --> 1:47:46.260]  We go back to the phone lines now, though, and let's go to Tim in California, who has
[1:47:46.260 --> 1:47:49.340]  something developing there in California I'm not heard of.
[1:47:49.340 --> 1:47:50.340]  Tim, go ahead.
[1:47:50.340 --> 1:47:53.620]  Well, it's not located in California.
[1:47:53.620 --> 1:47:57.100]  It's actually overseas, somewhere, borders two countries.
[1:47:57.100 --> 1:48:02.900]  Back in September of 2008, it took them a long time to build it, but they launched the
[1:48:02.900 --> 1:48:03.900]  large, hay-drawn.
[1:48:03.900 --> 1:48:06.620]  So you're talking about CERN.
[1:48:06.620 --> 1:48:07.620]  Exactly.
[1:48:07.620 --> 1:48:08.620]  666 CERN.
[1:48:08.620 --> 1:48:09.620]  Oh, okay.
[1:48:09.620 --> 1:48:10.620]  I'm sorry.
[1:48:10.620 --> 1:48:14.460]  I was under the impression there was a new CERN being built.
[1:48:14.460 --> 1:48:15.460]  You're talking about that.
[1:48:15.460 --> 1:48:17.220]  No, I am talking about it.
[1:48:17.220 --> 1:48:19.220]  I was going to step to that, too.
[1:48:19.220 --> 1:48:20.460]  This is the comedy.
[1:48:20.460 --> 1:48:24.900]  Why would you guys get so fascinated about this thing and then have all this information
[1:48:24.900 --> 1:48:27.780]  about all these terrible demonic spirits and all these things?
[1:48:27.780 --> 1:48:31.460]  We've opened the pit of hell, and then it just got very quiet, but here it is years
[1:48:31.460 --> 1:48:32.460]  later.
[1:48:32.460 --> 1:48:35.660]  They're planning on building not a 20-mile diameter, one like the first one.
[1:48:35.660 --> 1:48:38.660]  No, this one's going to be 62-mile diameter.
[1:48:38.660 --> 1:48:42.260]  You'll probably make it 626 just for fun, you know?
[1:48:42.260 --> 1:48:45.060]  Well, it's funny you say that, isn't it funny?
[1:48:45.060 --> 1:48:49.180]  The inert ingredients in your inoculation, well, they're 66.6%.
[1:48:49.180 --> 1:48:50.340]  It couldn't be any other amount.
[1:48:50.340 --> 1:48:51.580]  It had to be that amount.
[1:48:51.580 --> 1:48:56.620]  I was really into studying CERN like five or so years ago, and then there's so many
[1:48:56.620 --> 1:49:00.260]  weird anomalies, and people talk about weird anomalies in the sky around CERN.
[1:49:00.260 --> 1:49:03.260]  Their logo is 666.
[1:49:03.260 --> 1:49:11.580]  To me, the reason I bring this up is because Alex has just beaten his head in the ground.
[1:49:11.580 --> 1:49:12.580]  He's like, what is this?
[1:49:12.580 --> 1:49:13.580]  Is this space entities?
[1:49:13.580 --> 1:49:15.580]  Is this demonic?
[1:49:15.580 --> 1:49:20.540]  Everyone's just brainwashing it, and I think everything was cooking along that way until
[1:49:20.540 --> 1:49:22.180]  they opened up the pit of the hell.
[1:49:22.180 --> 1:49:24.980]  I think this is like letting the genie out of the bottle.
[1:49:24.980 --> 1:49:28.860]  I think this is about the time that everyone you knew all your life that you could have
[1:49:28.860 --> 1:49:32.380]  a reasonable conversation with suddenly had these choker faces.
[1:49:32.380 --> 1:49:34.660]  You know, they all got this demonic look.
[1:49:34.660 --> 1:49:40.140]  I mean, honestly, it's so crazy, you almost have to go to sci-fi to try to explain it.
[1:49:40.140 --> 1:49:45.260]  It's like the Ghostbusters or something, and like they just released all the ghosts.
[1:49:45.260 --> 1:49:48.820]  I mean, I don't know that this is the answer to all our problems, but I tell you what,
[1:49:48.820 --> 1:49:50.940]  I think it needs a real good sniff test.
[1:49:50.940 --> 1:49:55.580]  Well did you ever see in Europe they built some tunnel, it's like the longest underground
[1:49:55.580 --> 1:50:00.020]  tunnel, and it was like a weird ritual, it's real demonic.
[1:50:00.020 --> 1:50:03.980]  They had like the demonic ritual to introduce this tunnel, I forget what it was called.
[1:50:03.980 --> 1:50:10.980]  Anyway, if folks want a very curious thing to look into, CERN, the Large Hadron Collider,
[1:50:10.980 --> 1:50:14.060]  there's a lot of weird stuff going on there.
[1:50:14.060 --> 1:50:19.100]  You know, they're just trying to bend the physics and time and smash things together
[1:50:19.100 --> 1:50:21.180]  and you know, who knows what's going on.
[1:50:21.180 --> 1:50:22.180]  Tim, thank you so much for the call.
[1:50:22.180 --> 1:50:25.180]  Oh yeah, and their logo is 666, I'm sure that's not a big deal.
[1:50:25.180 --> 1:50:29.940]  Let's go to, let's see here, got some good callers here.
[1:50:29.940 --> 1:50:34.260]  Weiland in New Hampshire, you're on the Alex Jones show, go ahead.
[1:50:34.260 --> 1:50:40.580]  Yeah, this is Weiland, okay, in New Hampshire.
[1:50:40.580 --> 1:50:47.980]  I just wanted to say something, not say something, it's what I have come up with, you know, over
[1:50:47.980 --> 1:50:48.980]  the years.
[1:50:48.980 --> 1:50:54.820]  I've listened to Alex for 23 years and I've listened to a lot of things, and of course
[1:50:54.820 --> 1:50:59.500]  everybody tries to figure out something to the solution.
[1:50:59.500 --> 1:51:07.660]  Right now, I will be honest with you, I feel very bad for your listeners, because even
[1:51:07.660 --> 1:51:12.820]  probably by accident, but they've got a lot of information, and none of this information
[1:51:12.820 --> 1:51:15.780]  is going to solve a thing, one thing.
[1:51:15.780 --> 1:51:19.780]  Now it's going to be out of money supply, and I'm going to tell you why.
[1:51:19.780 --> 1:51:25.820]  We have a few-out-money supply, we've been set a lot of propaganda on that, so as such
[1:51:25.820 --> 1:51:29.580]  as a barrel full of money to buy a loaf of bread.
[1:51:29.580 --> 1:51:35.020]  Now, I mean, that's garbage, you know a lot of what you're thinking that way, okay?
[1:51:35.020 --> 1:51:40.900]  Now the few-out-money supply can be used for one or two reasons, depending on who controls
[1:51:40.900 --> 1:51:41.900]  it.
[1:51:41.900 --> 1:51:47.660]  It can be used for great wealth or great poverty, depending on who controls it and what their
[1:51:47.660 --> 1:51:48.660]  gender is.
[1:51:48.660 --> 1:51:53.460]  Well, and that's why we, the people controlling our currency, and they don't want a cryptocurrency
[1:51:53.460 --> 1:51:58.060]  because it's controlled by people and it's not centralized, and you know, I understand
[1:51:58.060 --> 1:52:03.420]  what you're talking about about the information here, but for me it was getting the information
[1:52:03.420 --> 1:52:07.420]  is what woke me up, so we just try to pay that forward, and we just believe if people
[1:52:07.420 --> 1:52:11.380]  hear the truth, they want to know the truth, they'll respond to the truth, and so that's
[1:52:11.380 --> 1:52:15.780]  why we do lay out the information, and we're filling the void, nobody else does it.
[1:52:15.780 --> 1:52:21.740]  So somebody has to fill it, and that's where Infowars comes into play, but yeah, eventually
[1:52:21.740 --> 1:52:24.580]  people are going to have to, it's going to have to be a mass awakening, and people are
[1:52:24.580 --> 1:52:27.780]  going to have to get involved in local politics, and I don't know where it goes from here to
[1:52:27.780 --> 1:52:33.340]  save America, but getting the information out there so people know what's going on is
[1:52:33.340 --> 1:52:34.820]  imperative to me.
[1:52:34.820 --> 1:52:39.740]  Let's go to Paul in Georgia, you're on the Alex Jones show, Paul go ahead.
[1:52:39.740 --> 1:52:47.300]  Those of who are awake have a duty to interpose themselves on this undeclared war against humanity.
[1:52:47.300 --> 1:52:54.620]  We have to stop these criminals, and we have to stop them from actually trying to institute
[1:52:54.620 --> 1:52:56.340]  all of their plans against us.
[1:52:56.340 --> 1:53:02.540]  There's a number of ways to do this, but it's not going to be on the political level, it
[1:53:02.540 --> 1:53:05.180]  has to be beyond that, it has to be cultural.
[1:53:05.180 --> 1:53:10.300]  Infowars has long since been working on the cultural level, but we have to continue to
[1:53:10.300 --> 1:53:14.620]  talk to the people as best we can, try to wake them up as best we can, and try to get
[1:53:14.620 --> 1:53:18.300]  them to understand, but they're going to end up killing a great number of us, it looks
[1:53:18.300 --> 1:53:19.300]  like.
[1:53:19.300 --> 1:53:20.300]  Your thoughts?
[1:53:20.300 --> 1:53:26.020]  Well, yeah, I mean, look at the vaccine alone, people are dropping dead, famous people, public
[1:53:26.020 --> 1:53:32.300]  health officials in India, so I mean, yeah, the abortions by the millions, yeah, some
[1:53:32.300 --> 1:53:38.140]  people don't even make it into this world, and some people get in and they get hit with
[1:53:38.140 --> 1:53:43.980]  the propaganda, they get hit with the poison in the water and the food, they get hit with
[1:53:43.980 --> 1:53:49.460]  the vaccine, so yeah, no, it's a population control agenda, eugenicists are at the top
[1:53:49.460 --> 1:53:54.740]  of it, and as soon as people realize that, they'll probably panic, quite frankly, but
[1:53:54.740 --> 1:54:00.900]  that's the appropriate response, Paul, thank you for the call, PL in Kansas, PL in Kansas,
[1:54:00.900 --> 1:54:03.500]  you're on the Alex Jones show, go ahead.
[1:54:03.500 --> 1:54:11.500]  Thank you all for, so first up, I'd like to start off by saying that I'm glad outlets
[1:54:11.500 --> 1:54:17.500]  like you guys and the National File and the Ethic Times provide a way for information
[1:54:17.500 --> 1:54:24.940]  about the truth regarding the vaccines, like how their mRNA gene therapies, basically,
[1:54:24.940 --> 1:54:30.820]  and how they have some pretty questionable research behind them gets out there, but at
[1:54:30.820 --> 1:54:36.380]  the same time, it kind of concerns me to think about how none of this information is getting
[1:54:36.380 --> 1:54:38.380]  out into the mainstream.
[1:54:38.380 --> 1:54:42.820]  Yeah, you still talk to the average person on the street or at the store or something,
[1:54:42.820 --> 1:54:44.380]  they don't know any of this.
[1:54:44.380 --> 1:54:50.780]  Like, for instance, the news here mostly talks about how the progress with the vaccine rollout
[1:54:50.780 --> 1:54:58.780]  is coming along and how the case rates look, but distressingly, there's very little information
[1:54:58.780 --> 1:54:59.780]  about how.
[1:54:59.780 --> 1:55:05.980]  Well, and let me explain it like this, the same censorship that we see on the internet
[1:55:05.980 --> 1:55:12.460]  from big tech companies has already run its course on television, we just didn't know it
[1:55:12.460 --> 1:55:16.860]  because it wasn't as easy to access, we couldn't get access to it.
[1:55:16.860 --> 1:55:24.980]  So television news has already gone through the rings of censorship where what we're seeing
[1:55:24.980 --> 1:55:29.340]  with censorship on social media is what's already been going on in television for decades.
[1:55:29.340 --> 1:55:32.660]  They've already censored people like Alex Jones off TV, they've already censored people
[1:55:32.660 --> 1:55:36.500]  like Michael Savage off TV, they've already put a blacklist out with my name on it for
[1:55:36.500 --> 1:55:37.500]  TV.
[1:55:37.500 --> 1:55:41.580]  So we just don't know that because we can't get access to it, but that's why, oh yeah,
[1:55:41.580 --> 1:55:45.780]  the television news telling you the vaccine is great, everybody says, ah, get the vaccine,
[1:55:45.780 --> 1:55:46.780]  it's all good.
[1:55:46.780 --> 1:55:50.540]  Whereas if you go to the independent media, they're at least showing you both sides of
[1:55:50.540 --> 1:55:51.540]  the aisle.
[1:55:51.540 --> 1:55:57.020]  So it's just the TV has already been totally censored, it's for the most part all propaganda
[1:55:57.020 --> 1:55:58.020]  now.
[1:55:58.020 --> 1:56:01.380]  That's why 95% of TV news was anti-Trump.
[1:56:01.380 --> 1:56:05.060]  Let's squeeze one more caller in here, Aaron in Las Vegas, make it quick.
[1:56:05.060 --> 1:56:09.500]  Oh, and pleasure to meet you, sir, yours as cool as Mr. Jones.
[1:56:09.500 --> 1:56:16.260]  I just want to hear your opinion on Title 18, USC, Section 242, on how that could pertain
[1:56:16.260 --> 1:56:19.620]  to putting masks on children in the schools.
[1:56:19.620 --> 1:56:25.980]  And the last sentence of that provision being, or death, what can we do to help the kids?
[1:56:25.980 --> 1:56:30.380]  Well, parents are going to have to go to school board meetings, they're going to have to run
[1:56:30.380 --> 1:56:32.740]  for school board, they're going to have to go to city councils, they're going to have
[1:56:32.740 --> 1:56:37.940]  to raise their voices, or they're going to have to pull their kids out of schools.
[1:56:37.940 --> 1:56:41.260]  One is you can't stop paying the taxes for the schools, so that's kind of where they
[1:56:41.260 --> 1:56:42.900]  have you there.
[1:56:42.900 --> 1:56:45.940]  But yeah, the torture of the children with the face masks is out of control, it's going
[1:56:45.940 --> 1:56:47.540]  to have to be parents that rise up.
[1:56:47.540 --> 1:56:49.940]  We have to be the voice, the parents have to be the voice of the young.
[1:56:49.940 --> 1:56:51.460]  Aaron, thanks for the call.
[1:56:51.460 --> 1:56:58.580]  On this day, Rick Monday of the Chicago Cubs, on this day, April 25th, Rick Monday of the
[1:56:58.580 --> 1:57:03.380]  Chicago Cubs did a heroic act, which today would have probably landed him in jail, but
[1:57:03.380 --> 1:57:08.380]  he flashed back in time to a better time when American athletes were patriots.
[1:57:08.380 --> 1:57:19.380]  I'm not sure what he's doing out there, it looks like he's going to burn a flag, and
[1:57:19.380 --> 1:57:26.380]  Rick Monday runs and takes it away from him, and so Monday, I think a guy was going to set
[1:57:26.380 --> 1:57:29.380]  fire to the American flag, can you imagine that?
[1:57:29.380 --> 1:57:42.860]  Look at that, and the broadcasters loved it, the crowd loved it, even the Jumbotron loved
[1:57:42.860 --> 1:57:43.860]  it.
[1:57:43.860 --> 1:57:45.860]  A better day where an American patriot was a hero.
[1:57:45.860 --> 1:57:48.380]  Harrison Smith takes over, you stay classy, Info Warriors.
[1:57:48.380 --> 1:57:54.220]  In-game blueprint for global enslavement made 14 years ago, accurately predicted the globalist
[1:57:54.220 --> 1:57:59.020]  takeover using the great reset and the threat of a virus.
[1:57:59.020 --> 1:58:01.420]  This film is now more important than ever.
[1:58:01.420 --> 1:58:06.700]  I noticed just a few months ago that suddenly, the limited supply we had at InfoWarsTour.com
[1:58:06.700 --> 1:58:11.660]  had sold out, and people were really talking about the documentary because major platforms
[1:58:11.660 --> 1:58:16.260]  like Amazon had banned it because the globalists had openly criticized the film, like the New
[1:58:16.260 --> 1:58:23.060]  York Times, and so we printed 20,000 copies now back in print, and in less than two weeks
[1:58:23.060 --> 1:58:25.060]  we've already sold half of them.
[1:58:25.060 --> 1:58:30.060]  This is very, very exciting, we're selling them close to cost, and 3.95 a piece for you
[1:58:30.060 --> 1:58:35.060]  buy them in bulk, or 14.95 you buy them individually, there is a zero country code on it, meaning
[1:58:35.060 --> 1:58:37.260]  you can copy this anywhere in the world.
[1:58:37.260 --> 1:58:41.820]  Get it, burn copies, share it with everyone, it's blowing people away, it's evergreen,
[1:58:41.820 --> 1:58:42.820]  it predicted it all.
[1:58:42.820 --> 1:58:48.820]  In-game blueprint for global enslavement, available now at DVD and at www.FoWarsTour.com.
[1:58:48.820 --> 1:58:52.740]  Again, I don't like to lecture people, I'm a very private person, but because of the
[1:58:52.740 --> 1:58:56.500]  globalists and their attack on humanity, I've been forced the last 27 years to be a
[1:58:56.500 --> 1:59:00.740]  public figure, and we've given the globalists one hell of a run for their money because
[1:59:00.740 --> 1:59:01.740]  of God.
[1:59:01.740 --> 1:59:05.420]  And I know some of our listeners get mad when I talk about God all day, but just give
[1:59:05.420 --> 1:59:09.380]  me a break, the Satanism's out in the open, I've always been a Christian, but now the
[1:59:09.380 --> 1:59:13.220]  fact that it's a fight between good and evil is so clear, and I get it, a lot of you've
[1:59:13.220 --> 1:59:17.900]  been turned off by big churches, a lot of you've been turned off by the corrupt priest
[1:59:17.900 --> 1:59:22.780]  class system, and I get it, me too, believe me, I'm one of them, but it's that relationship
[1:59:22.780 --> 1:59:29.140]  with God and just God's universe that God created that is so essential, and God created
[1:59:29.140 --> 1:59:33.460]  the universe for us to have communion with God through and to have life, and so that's
[1:59:33.460 --> 1:59:37.140]  what M-Full Wars is really all about, so thank you all for your word of mouth, thank you
[1:59:37.140 --> 1:59:40.340]  for spreading the word about M-Full Wars, and thank you for supporting us to keep us
