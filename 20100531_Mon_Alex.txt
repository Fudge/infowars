[00:00.000 --> 00:21.520]  Alright, we're back live. We're now into hour number four. We have a guest coming up.
[00:21.520 --> 00:28.560]  I will intersperse some financial news and some treason news coming up during this interview.
[00:28.560 --> 00:34.880]  Very important treason news coming up, but right now let's jam a few more phone calls in here.
[00:34.880 --> 00:41.440]  Up next is Michael in Colorado. Thanks for holding her on the ear.
[00:41.440 --> 00:42.800]  Hey Alex.
[00:42.800 --> 00:44.160]  Yes sir.
[00:44.160 --> 00:53.920]  To do with what you were saying, like how they put things in front of our face before they execute the attack.
[00:53.920 --> 00:59.120]  Last year I was watching Discovery and it was a show about like ice ages, right?
[00:59.120 --> 01:04.000]  So they skip to this thing where they have all these scientists talking about the ice age and how
[01:04.000 --> 01:08.320]  they were actually talking about how there's an ice age coming instead of global warming,
[01:08.320 --> 01:12.480]  but that's not the point. They were working on these satellites, right, with these reflectors,
[01:13.120 --> 01:19.360]  and they were saying that with like four or five of these lights pointed at one spot on the ocean,
[01:19.360 --> 01:26.800]  they would be able to raise the global temperature enough to battle this ice age or whatever.
[01:28.080 --> 01:31.040]  But what they would need to do is have an oil slick on the ocean
[01:32.160 --> 01:36.960]  surface in order to bounce this ray into our atmosphere to bring up the temperature.
[01:39.520 --> 01:44.800]  Well, I know this. Now that you in is saying they're worried about global freezing
[01:45.360 --> 01:48.880]  and we're supposed to forget about all their fake global warming and they're teaching
[01:48.880 --> 01:54.480]  school kids we must stabilize the climate. The climate is always unstable. I mean,
[01:54.480 --> 01:59.360]  they're even trying to blame volcanoes on global warming now. I mean, I joked about that a few
[01:59.360 --> 02:05.920]  weeks ago about the Iceland volcano. They're now in the news saying, oh, yes, thawing glaciers
[02:05.920 --> 02:12.640]  reduced pressure on the volcano. That has nothing to do with it. And by the way, glaciers worldwide
[02:12.640 --> 02:19.120]  in the last three years have been getting bigger. So I mean, they say the Haitian earthquake was
[02:19.120 --> 02:25.680]  caused by global warming. They say the Chilean earthquake was caused by it. And because they
[02:25.680 --> 02:30.560]  know the public is kind of halfway paying attention. And oh, you better pay Al Gore. But
[02:30.560 --> 02:34.400]  meanwhile, Al Gore says he believes that the sea levels are going to rise the next 10 years and
[02:34.400 --> 02:40.720]  fought all the major cities. He's bought two mansions on waterfront property. It's just made
[02:40.720 --> 02:47.200]  up fraud. You got this big demonic, fat, lying piece of trash that told us Naftan Gatt was going
[02:47.200 --> 02:52.960]  to be the greatest thing since sliced bread. And then he's up there saying buy pay him money.
[02:53.760 --> 02:59.360]  And he will save you from raising water. I mean, he's literally just a complete joke. I appreciate
[02:59.360 --> 03:04.480]  your call. Again, how did Naftan Gatt turn out for you folks? Well, remember he was the one pushing
[03:04.480 --> 03:11.760]  that. He was the big spearhead on that. He loves conning people. He enjoys robbing you. Al Gore
[03:11.760 --> 03:16.960]  is a piece of trash. Chris in Boston, you're on the air. Go ahead. Alex, how you doing, man?
[03:16.960 --> 03:21.200]  All right. Good. Now, I hope you hear the word. Thank you enough every day, every week,
[03:21.200 --> 03:24.480]  because it's certainly doing a lot for our country. Well, I appreciate you, buddy. I'm just trying
[03:24.480 --> 03:30.880]  to save my family. Go ahead. Me too. I have a 10 year old son. So I hear that. But I'm a musician,
[03:30.880 --> 03:35.840]  actually a conservative libertarian musician living in Boston. So you see how that works out for me
[03:35.840 --> 03:42.240]  here in liberal Boston. But actually, Bob Chapman sent you a song that I wrote called Freedom.
[03:42.240 --> 03:45.760]  I was on a radio program with him. I'm not sure if you heard the song at all.
[03:47.280 --> 03:53.040]  You know, it does ring a bell. I mean, I've heard so much good music. I'll have to go pull it up.
[03:53.040 --> 03:57.600]  Is it on YouTube? Yeah, it's on YouTube. And if you can look up, I think April 28th,
[03:57.600 --> 04:02.240]  Bob sent you the email at the YouTube link. But I wanted to, you know, just if you ever
[04:02.240 --> 04:06.160]  want to use that song for any movies for your charge, I just want to be part of the cause.
[04:06.160 --> 04:10.720]  And you know, what's the, what's the name of this song on YouTube? It's called Freedom.
[04:11.360 --> 04:15.440]  Probably a lot of stuff under freedom. Yeah, just look up Chris Ross, Freedom.
[04:15.440 --> 04:20.080]  Okay, good. We'll check it out. And by the way, I looked up American Spectator and I had the
[04:20.080 --> 04:25.360]  quote. I'm not sure if anyone, what by Rand Paul. Yeah. Yeah, give us the quote.
[04:25.360 --> 04:29.920]  He basically just said, as a United States Senator, I would never vote to condemn Israel
[04:29.920 --> 04:35.520]  for defending herself. And that's it. Well, yeah. And I mean, if Israel gets attacked,
[04:36.880 --> 04:42.640]  then they have a right to defend themselves. So how is that? I mean, you've got the left
[04:42.640 --> 04:48.240]  media, you've got the right wing media. They're all establishment incumbents attacking Rand Paul.
[04:48.240 --> 04:52.640]  What does that tell you about it? I mean, when you've got the entire fake political
[04:52.640 --> 04:57.360]  spectrum attacking him, you know, he's good. We'll be right back. Stay with us.

[08:06.240 --> 08:14.240]  the information war continues. It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. Christopher C. Horner
[08:14.240 --> 08:19.760]  is our guest for the rest of the hour. He serves as a senior fellow at CEI competitive enterprise
[08:19.760 --> 08:26.080]  institute. He's an attorney in Washington, D.C. Horner is represented CEI as well as scientist
[08:26.080 --> 08:30.320]  and members of the U.S. House and Senate on matters of environmental policy in the federal
[08:30.320 --> 08:35.120]  courts, including the Supreme Court. He has written on numerous topics and publications ranging from
[08:35.120 --> 08:40.800]  law reviews to legal and industrial trade journals to print and online opinion pages
[08:40.800 --> 08:46.160]  and as the author of the two best-selling books, Red Hot Lies, How Global Warming Alarmist Used
[08:46.160 --> 08:52.480]  Threats, Fraud and Deception to Keep You Misinformed. Greenpeace has repeatedly targeted Mr. Horner
[08:52.480 --> 08:57.360]  by stealing his garbage on a weekly basis, issuing press releases, announcing with whom he dines
[08:57.920 --> 09:01.920]  and including him in various other historical publications. Of course, they're funded by
[09:01.920 --> 09:07.760]  big central banks. They have a fleet bigger than major government's fleets. They want your property.
[09:07.760 --> 09:16.640]  They want to guilt you into handing everything over to the elite. And his new book is Power
[09:16.640 --> 09:22.640]  Grab, How Obama's Green Police, Green Policies Will Steal Your Freedom in Bankrupt America.
[09:22.640 --> 09:26.960]  Again, new book Power Grab, How Obama's Green Policies Will Steal Your Freedom
[09:26.960 --> 09:34.640]  in Bankrupt America. And folks, my issue here is rhetoric cannot describe how bad they are. I mean,
[09:34.640 --> 09:39.520]  you watch Audi commercials like Green Police. That's actually what they're doing in Europe
[09:39.520 --> 09:44.320]  and what they have planned here. This has nothing to do with the environment. It's a bunch of control
[09:44.320 --> 09:52.000]  freaks running your life, controlling every facet of it. They know global warming is a fraud.
[09:52.000 --> 09:58.160]  They've already moved on to other scaremongering and they're not going to stop. And they've said,
[09:58.160 --> 10:02.880]  even if the Senate won't pass this legislation, they don't care. They're going to have the
[10:02.880 --> 10:08.880]  executive branch implement it. So if they are successful, it's over. And look at how they
[10:08.880 --> 10:14.400]  cowed and beat Republicans into submission, because this is what the establishment wants.
[10:14.400 --> 10:20.560]  Look at how BP's been one of their biggest funders of global carbon taxes, a new derivative scam.
[10:20.560 --> 10:28.560]  So Christopher C. Horner, author of Power Grab that just came out, CEI.org is the website.
[10:28.560 --> 10:33.520]  It's good to have you here with us, sir. Thank you, Alex. So much is going on. Let's get into
[10:33.520 --> 10:39.360]  since we had you on two or three months ago, what's happened with the Power Grab, the fake
[10:39.360 --> 10:48.560]  environmental movement, and what new heads the Hydra has sprout, and where all this is going.
[10:49.120 --> 10:56.880]  Okay. So about 11 months ago, the House passed this cap and trade bill. It was about 1,300 pages long.
[10:56.880 --> 11:03.280]  And they obviously did not read the bill. They snuck in 300 more pages of buying votes
[11:03.280 --> 11:09.280]  at 3 a.m. the night of the morning of the vote, and folks declared it dead in the Senate. And
[11:09.280 --> 11:14.080]  then something strange happened. People did get upset, and they had recently been talking about
[11:14.080 --> 11:18.240]  drill here, drill now, and we're sitting on the world's largest energy reserves, and the real
[11:18.240 --> 11:24.160]  national security issue is refusing to tap your domestic energy resources. We won't pass an energy
[11:24.160 --> 11:28.720]  rationing scheme, right? Well, about two and a half weeks ago, three weeks ago, Harry Reid,
[11:28.720 --> 11:34.800]  the Senate Majority Leader, openly said to Washington Papers Politico and I think the Hill
[11:35.440 --> 11:40.320]  that he was going to suspend the committee process in the Senate in order to cramp cap
[11:40.320 --> 11:45.760]  and trade down, but they decided they wouldn't call it cap and trade. Reid said, several people said
[11:45.760 --> 11:49.280]  things that are very important. There are four people, Harry Reid, John Kerry, Joe Lieberman,
[11:49.280 --> 11:55.280]  and Lindy Grant. Harry Reid said, well, this would entail the jurisdiction of almost every
[11:55.280 --> 12:00.320]  Senate committee. Now, pause and stop, why? Because it impacts almost every aspect of your life,
[12:00.320 --> 12:04.720]  including the Senate Finance Committee, which writes tax law. It's the biggest tax increase in
[12:04.720 --> 12:09.360]  our history and so on. Reid said, therefore, obviously the four deers would just get confused,
[12:09.360 --> 12:13.920]  he's going to write the bill. And he began bringing in constituencies, and that means not your
[12:13.920 --> 12:19.680]  listeners, by the way, it means that even the Chamber and API and green pressure groups,
[12:19.680 --> 12:25.520]  and he asked them, what do you need in order to support this bill? And he asked the Chamber of
[12:25.520 --> 12:30.720]  Commerce and the American Petroleum Institute, what do you need to not run those television ads?
[12:30.720 --> 12:35.760]  Because both groups raised a lot of money to run ads, educating voters on this energy tax,
[12:35.760 --> 12:41.520]  unless they gave them what they want. And so far it appears they probably got what they want,
[12:41.520 --> 12:48.000]  which is essentially a gas tax on top of the light switch tax to give to funnel money to projects.
[12:48.000 --> 12:52.000]  And now they're claiming, I've heard them on the news, oh, there's a new bill in the Senate
[12:52.000 --> 12:58.000]  to fund the cleanup in the Gulf. How convenient that this BP spill happened when they're one of
[12:58.000 --> 13:03.520]  the biggest pushers of the carbon tax. And how convenient they wouldn't put the booms in early
[13:03.520 --> 13:08.640]  in Louisiana and Mississippi and Florida and are letting the oil come in. Oh, I'm afraid they have
[13:08.640 --> 13:14.800]  to have their taxes now. Let me tell you something. I was in the room with BP. I sat in for a gentleman
[13:14.800 --> 13:21.920]  named Ken Lake 13 years ago this month. I was, as I've discussed with you very briefly, I was the
[13:21.920 --> 13:26.720]  director of federal government relations for a company called Enron. And my number one priority
[13:26.720 --> 13:31.600]  I was told after I took the job was to get a global warming treaty and a domestic cap and trade scheme.
[13:31.600 --> 13:36.240]  And the company they developed it with was BP, and they had set up this market with Goldman
[13:36.240 --> 13:41.600]  Sachs. Oh, it does fit very conveniently. Look, I understand how it fits into the narrative today,
[13:41.600 --> 13:45.760]  but you have to understand, I was the crazy guy in the street corner muttering about this for about
[13:46.560 --> 13:51.840]  six years before anybody. Oh, wait a second. I got it. It's called red thinking these businesses
[13:51.840 --> 13:56.080]  trying to make money the old fashioned way by having their bodies in government agree to take
[13:56.080 --> 14:00.400]  some of their power and return for guaranteed opposition to competition and a wealth transfer
[14:00.400 --> 14:05.600]  from you and me to them. So they bought all these uneconomic industries like Enron had the
[14:05.600 --> 14:10.720]  world's largest windmill company they bought on the cheap. It's now called GE Wind. Well, I mean,
[14:10.720 --> 14:15.840]  here's an example. BP will pay a billion dollar fine. They've already made that in increased oil
[14:15.840 --> 14:21.840]  prices. And then now they'll get more liability protection from government. Their competition
[14:21.840 --> 14:27.920]  won't be able to drill in the Gulf. It's just like FEMA got more power by screwing up what happened
[14:27.920 --> 14:32.640]  in Katrina. Well, I'll tell you this. It's pretty clear that it, well, it's in the public record
[14:32.640 --> 14:36.720]  that the green groups actually with whom I met, by the way, that same day in the same room,
[14:37.360 --> 14:40.480]  there were groups like Union of Concerned Scientists and Natural Resources Defense
[14:40.480 --> 14:45.840]  Council. They were Baptist and bootlegger coalitions. The green groups after the BP, after the,
[14:46.720 --> 14:53.360]  the well exploded, the green groups were shrieking to the White House. Don't you dare burn that oil
[14:53.360 --> 14:58.000]  off. And they screamed about consequences of burning igniting the oil before it got too well
[14:58.000 --> 15:04.240]  mixed. Well, as I said, actually on a TV show, I think that night or within a few days, you have
[15:04.240 --> 15:11.440]  to understand something. I could be as irresponsible as a lot of people were about Bush and just say,
[15:11.440 --> 15:16.720]  look, the administration, which by the way was BP's favorite political candidate over 20 years,
[15:16.720 --> 15:21.360]  if you know, the administration was just taking orders from his green group buddies and they'd
[15:21.360 --> 15:26.480]  want this to be as bad as it can possibly be because the damage while real is temporary.
[15:26.480 --> 15:31.120]  The tragedy was the 11 men who lost their lives. But this is a White House that says,
[15:31.120 --> 15:36.400]  never let a good crisis go to waste. They even engineer crises like claiming a global catastrophe
[15:36.400 --> 15:41.520]  from global warming. And the Greens, of course, have never made money hand over fist like they have.
[15:41.520 --> 15:45.360]  And for those that don't know, and for those that don't know, if they would have ignited
[15:45.360 --> 15:50.560]  this within hours, there would be almost a zero problem. Almost all of it would have burned off
[15:50.560 --> 15:55.920]  at the source. Carbon dioxide would have been put into the atmosphere much smaller than a
[15:55.920 --> 16:01.600]  volcano would have literally had almost no effect if they would have done what the old timers did
[16:01.600 --> 16:09.200]  and set that sucker on fire until they figured out a plan to cap it. And now we know why 35 days
[16:09.200 --> 16:14.320]  later, the White House has done everything they can to block this because now they're going to get
[16:14.320 --> 16:20.800]  their carbon taxes that Paul Volcker demands we must have to pay Goldman Sachs their bonuses.
[16:20.800 --> 16:26.240]  Now they're going to get it. Let me tell you, okay, so we know what BP actually did engineer
[16:26.240 --> 16:30.480]  this and the Greens are biting them as you knew they would. BP and Enron were in on this from
[16:30.480 --> 16:34.000]  the beginning again. I was in the room. There's no point denying it. The Greens did tell the
[16:34.000 --> 16:37.920]  White House don't burn it off. We just know the White House said don't burn it off. It probably
[16:37.920 --> 16:42.400]  is that co-incidence when they weren't taking the marching orders from the Greens. But we know BP
[16:42.400 --> 16:48.480]  has been pushing an agenda that John Kerry said, even after the spill, ironically, he said,
[16:48.480 --> 16:53.520]  I've been working with these companies, BP and Shell, to write this law. He said this,
[16:53.520 --> 16:58.080]  it's again in the public domain. So, Harry Reid said I'm going to suspend the committee process
[16:58.080 --> 17:02.560]  like with healthcare. John Kerry said I'm not going to call this bill cap-and-trade because I
[17:02.560 --> 17:07.120]  don't know what cap-and-trade means. Yes, he does. And it has cap-and-trade in it. He just said
[17:07.120 --> 17:12.960]  it's not, it's mean if you call it that because of course there's a memo I talk about in PowerGraph
[17:12.960 --> 17:18.160]  written by Stanley Greenberg who was Bill Clinton's poster. He conducted the polling and he said
[17:18.160 --> 17:23.280]  to his clients who are democratic politicians, you have to do two things. Stop saying cap-and-trade
[17:23.280 --> 17:27.840]  and global warming and start calling it something else and then it might work. Don't change your
[17:27.840 --> 17:32.000]  agenda. Just call the agenda something else. Yeah, he called it our deteriorating atmosphere.
[17:33.040 --> 17:37.360]  Well, he said here are the catchphrases that I've pulled well. Green jobs and clean energy.
[17:37.920 --> 17:41.120]  So, John Kerry said I don't want to call it cap-and-trade. I don't know what cap-and-trade
[17:41.120 --> 17:46.240]  means. It's a jobs and national security bill, clean energy, of course it is here. Joe Lieberman
[17:46.240 --> 17:50.640]  said, oh, I don't want to call it cap-and-trade because you remember the artist formerly known
[17:50.640 --> 17:55.680]  as Prince. Well, this is now called pollution emission. He said that. This is now called
[17:55.680 --> 18:00.480]  the pollution emission reduction credits or something. He won't say cap-and-trade.
[18:00.480 --> 18:06.480]  Lindsey Graham said two weeks ago, oh, this isn't a global warming bill because global warming no
[18:06.480 --> 18:12.160]  longer exists as a reason to pass legislation. It's still the same bill. He still said he'd vote
[18:12.160 --> 18:15.840]  for it. He just took his name. He said I won't be a sponsor because I'll get in all sorts of
[18:15.840 --> 18:20.880]  trouble with my constituents, but I'll still support it. But it's no longer the reason that
[18:20.880 --> 18:26.560]  it's always been. The point of all this is where I begin with the book. Nobody says cap-and-trade
[18:26.560 --> 18:31.360]  would detectably impact climate. I repeat, nobody says the temperature after cap-and-trade would
[18:31.360 --> 18:36.080]  be any different than it otherwise was going to be. It's not about the temperature. It was offered
[18:36.080 --> 18:41.440]  in the name of the temperature. Their pollster told them to cut it out. Of course, it's about
[18:41.440 --> 18:46.240]  deciding who can have industry, who can have businesses and tax in the hell out of us. Yep.
[18:46.240 --> 18:51.200]  And in fact, here's what I do. I begin by pointing out we know it's not about the climate, so what's
[18:51.200 --> 18:57.040]  it about? Well, it turns out it's about power. It turns out that it is about they can't trust you
[18:57.040 --> 19:01.360]  with your various freedoms that they never thought they could trust you with anyway. And I've got
[19:01.360 --> 19:05.920]  quotes in here that are out there that for some reason nobody's running with. Carol Browner gave
[19:05.920 --> 19:10.880]  it. She's the energy and climate czar who had a phony position, that position created for her
[19:10.880 --> 19:15.120]  because she could never achieve Senate confirmation and she would cause great political havoc,
[19:15.120 --> 19:19.600]  of course, having been a commissioner for the Socialist International. If Obama tried to get
[19:19.600 --> 19:24.880]  her confirmed, she was put into this phony position to lower it over cabinet officials.
[19:24.880 --> 19:28.800]  And she gave an interview to US News in March of last year in which she said,
[19:28.800 --> 19:33.280]  it's their objective to get to the point where the electric utilities hold back power from you
[19:33.280 --> 19:37.680]  so that you'll still be able to cool your home just not as much as you would like.
[19:37.680 --> 19:43.200]  Meaning what, Alex? As much as they would like. They're admitting it. Stay there. This is incredible.
[19:43.200 --> 19:49.520]  Let's come back and talk about the control freak Panoptagon. And Texas, I already had it put into
[19:49.520 --> 19:54.720]  my office that I couldn't say no. California, they're going to remote control your thermostat.
[19:54.720 --> 19:58.240]  They're going to run everything and surveil you. We'll be back with our guest.
[20:01.520 --> 20:06.240]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle and
[20:06.240 --> 20:09.920]  they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[20:09.920 --> 20:15.200]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[20:15.200 --> 20:19.280]  Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it?
[20:19.280 --> 20:24.400]  Now or after the battle starts, when will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification?
[20:24.400 --> 20:29.280]  Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed
[20:29.280 --> 20:34.320]  yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems
[20:34.320 --> 20:39.920]  if you have a good food supply. Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[20:39.920 --> 20:45.120]  How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones.

[22:00.640 --> 22:04.880]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[22:04.880 --> 22:10.000]  Tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[22:10.000 --> 22:15.360]  It really says that the state is God. The United States is now recognized globally as one of
[22:15.360 --> 22:21.200]  the most oppressive police states on earth. This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret
[22:21.200 --> 22:26.640]  network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes how the
[22:26.640 --> 22:31.680]  continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state. Police State 4
[22:31.680 --> 22:36.720]  chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen. Prepare to enter the secret
[22:36.720 --> 22:43.600]  of world of emergency dictatorship. Body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and
[22:43.600 --> 22:48.720]  cameras on every street corner. It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.

[22:56.400 --> 23:03.120]  in the highest quality at prismplanet.tv. Gold isn't for you. Ted Anderson, president of Mitis
[23:03.120 --> 23:07.760]  Resources. One of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms. I get it. You
[23:07.760 --> 23:12.240]  wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will
[23:12.240 --> 23:16.880]  stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that social security would be there for
[23:16.880 --> 23:22.480]  you. That's not what's happening. You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel
[23:22.480 --> 23:27.440]  inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure. If all
[23:27.440 --> 23:32.160]  looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold. For the realists, there have never been
[23:32.160 --> 23:38.160]  more sobering reasons to diversify with gold. Since 2001, the US dollar index has tanked 30%
[23:38.160 --> 23:44.160]  while gold has risen 300%. Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[23:44.160 --> 23:48.640]  You should too. Find out what they know. Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do
[23:48.640 --> 23:58.320]  very well. Free 800-686-2237. 800-686-2237. That's 800-686-2237.
[24:01.600 --> 24:07.200]  All right, Chris Horner's new book is Power Grab. We'll tell you how to get that before he leaves
[24:07.200 --> 24:11.520]  us. Very important info, but all those books are bestsellers, so you'll see it all over the place.
[24:11.520 --> 24:15.840]  And again, I researched this constantly. Everything he's saying is on record. He's
[24:15.840 --> 24:18.080]  bringing up Carol Browner. He's going to go over more of these. He's like,
[24:18.080 --> 24:24.320]  we'll control your thermostat. We'll run your life. We're your God. What about Elena Kagan?
[24:24.320 --> 24:29.280]  Over and over again saying, if we don't like your speech, it's banned, or Cass Sunstein, or we're
[24:29.280 --> 24:34.880]  going to get your guns, or the White House science are, we're going to put stuff in the water to
[24:34.880 --> 24:40.960]  sterilize you. I mean, folks, I don't just say this. I have their white papers. Here's Elena Kagan,
[24:40.960 --> 24:47.360]  University of Chicago Law Review. I mean, I've got the White House science are his own textbook
[24:47.360 --> 24:51.840]  right here. These people, these people are in league with Hitler and Stalin. And I don't say
[24:51.840 --> 24:57.360]  that for rhetoric. Let me go back to my guess. Chris, you started reading her quotes. It's
[24:57.360 --> 25:04.480]  just, it's like a bad dream. I mean, how can these people be such dirtbags, so obviously evil?
[25:04.480 --> 25:09.920]  And such a threat to everybody. I mean, most people I know with money, you're fleeing the country.
[25:09.920 --> 25:15.040]  Go ahead. Well, they have this. The one thing that's never changed is their utopian vision.
[25:15.040 --> 25:20.480]  It's a dystopian, yes, me, but this idea that they will organize society. What changes is their
[25:20.480 --> 25:24.560]  vehicle? What's the excuse? What's the latest victim that has to be rescued from the heart
[25:24.560 --> 25:29.280]  of individual liberty? And it was, of course, the worker and the worker threw off their shackles.
[25:29.280 --> 25:33.280]  So it became the environment, which can't speak back. Wealthier is healthier. Wealthier is cleaner.
[25:33.280 --> 25:38.240]  They have to know this, but they really hate wealth. It's just the excuse, the latest excuse.
[25:38.240 --> 25:42.640]  Freedom brings wealth, so they attack your freedom. How badly? Well, all right, the
[25:42.640 --> 25:46.720]  president has given some speeches that in isolation just seemed weird. He said, of course,
[25:46.720 --> 25:53.040]  under my plan of a capitrade system, electricity prices would necessarily skyrocket. He said he
[25:53.040 --> 25:59.360]  would use it to bankrupt industries he didn't like. His quote was coal, you know, natural gas,
[25:59.360 --> 26:03.760]  whatever the industries. Then he admitted it would be passed on to a consumer and he said,
[26:03.760 --> 26:08.960]  and this will also raise billions of dollars. Well, in the book, I detail how I used FOIA
[26:08.960 --> 26:14.400]  to get treasury documents that say there was a memo written six days after Obama was elected,
[26:14.400 --> 26:18.560]  in which they said he wants to do this. Here's what we can do. And under the justification
[26:18.560 --> 26:24.960]  paragraph, they wrote revenues. This will raise quote possibly up to several percentage points
[26:24.960 --> 26:33.120]  of GDP, parentheses, i.e., the equivalent of the corporate income tax rate or corporate income tax.
[26:33.120 --> 26:37.840]  The corporate income tax among the highest in the world raises $400 billion per year.
[26:37.840 --> 26:42.320]  The biggest tax increase in our history to pay off World War II, which was an expiring tax,
[26:42.880 --> 26:48.080]  it cost $107 billion per year. So we're talking about a spectacular amount of money,
[26:48.080 --> 26:51.840]  but they don't just want to steal your money, they want to steal your freedoms. He gave another
[26:51.840 --> 26:55.280]  speech in which he said that you can't eat what you want, drive what you want, or put your thermostat
[26:55.280 --> 27:00.160]  where you want. The specific quote was, we can't eat as much as we want, drive our SUVs, and keep
[27:00.160 --> 27:05.120]  our thermostat to 72 degrees at all times, and expect that other countries are just going to say,
[27:05.120 --> 27:10.880]  okay, well, I didn't ask, okay, but B, what is the President of the United States doing,
[27:10.880 --> 27:15.600]  obsessing about how much I can eat, what I can drive, and where I can put my thermostat?
[27:15.600 --> 27:20.560]  Well, he's also playing us off against other countries and invoking hatred of us,
[27:20.560 --> 27:26.320]  just like he had Calderon here last week saying ban all our semi-automatic rifles and handguns.
[27:26.320 --> 27:30.000]  This is the socialist international. This is their mode.
[27:30.640 --> 27:35.200]  Well, sovereignty is not a big thing to them. They do believe that one way to skin this cat is
[27:35.200 --> 27:39.360]  through. Global governance is not the same as a global government, though the global
[27:39.360 --> 27:43.040]  governance crowd would of course love that. I'm just saying, he's a big proponent of
[27:43.040 --> 27:46.880]  global governance. What I'd like to do if we can stay when I come back is talk about
[27:46.880 --> 27:51.440]  the way they want to control your thermostat, and you're not going to believe the document
[27:51.440 --> 27:58.320]  that someone split me, but the Guardian in the UK, Old Red herself, reported that the Obama
[27:58.320 --> 28:03.600]  administration was briefing European diplomats before Copenhagen that failed global thank goodness.
[28:03.600 --> 28:07.680]  Oh yeah, no, no, no, they're going to tax you for any amount, and then they say in peak times,
[28:07.680 --> 28:10.720]  they're going to control it. That's actually, they're announcing that in California.
[28:10.720 --> 28:15.760]  Start getting into it right now. Well, okay, well, they want to use these things called smart meters.
[28:15.760 --> 28:19.680]  Smart meters put the meat on the bones of what Carol Browner said when she said,
[28:19.680 --> 28:23.040]  we want to get to a system whereby the utility holds back power from you.
[28:23.040 --> 28:26.720]  Why would a utility hold back power from you? They're in the business of selling you power
[28:26.720 --> 28:31.040]  because there's physical scarcity, which this crowd is arranging as I detail in the book,
[28:31.040 --> 28:34.080]  and because they've got a requirement that they hold back power from you.
[28:34.080 --> 28:38.720]  So the state is going to use the utility according to the energies are to decide,
[28:38.720 --> 28:42.720]  she said, you'll still be able to cool your home. It's not as much as you would like,
[28:42.720 --> 28:46.720]  which means just as much as they would like. Well, it turns out,
[28:46.720 --> 28:52.080]  the assistant secretary of energy for energy efficiency, a woman who was Al Gore's CEO before
[28:52.080 --> 28:58.800]  she took this job making $325,000 a year as a green pressure group CEO. She divested herself
[28:58.800 --> 29:02.880]  of utility stocks because of course the appearances would be terrible if she didn't,
[29:02.880 --> 29:06.640]  but someone slipped me her financial disclosure documents and guess what,
[29:06.640 --> 29:13.200]  she held on to a half million dollars in a smart meter company. How about that? Assistant
[29:13.200 --> 29:17.520]  Secretary of Energy for Energy Efficiency, in charge of getting the smart meter mandate in,
[29:17.520 --> 29:22.400]  that Carol Browner says is the way that you can't control your thermostat, the state will,
[29:22.400 --> 29:30.720]  and we've got a woman who held on to between $265,000 and $550,000 of smart meter company stock
[29:30.720 --> 29:36.000]  in addition to another green good jobs company, her husband. It's incredible, stay there. Folks,
[29:36.000 --> 29:42.160]  this is why I get angry and you should be angry too. They're openly saying they're going to decide
[29:42.160 --> 29:47.440]  what temp your house is, naked body scanners aren't enough, all their taxes aren't enough,
[29:48.000 --> 29:53.840]  nothing is enough for these people. We're on the march, the empire's on the run.

[31:54.960 --> 32:03.520]  that number 1-800-409-5633. This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[32:03.520 --> 32:08.400]  solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your
[32:08.400 --> 32:13.520]  electric bill. Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[32:13.520 --> 32:18.560]  company allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of
[32:18.560 --> 32:23.680]  smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is
[32:23.680 --> 32:28.880]  dangerously overloaded. And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[32:28.880 --> 32:34.080]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families
[32:34.080 --> 32:38.640]  lose their power from weather-related onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides
[32:38.640 --> 32:43.200]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators

[33:05.920 --> 33:10.400]  We're going back to Christopher Horner right now. New book, Power Grab,
[33:10.400 --> 33:16.000]  Obama's Green Policy Will Steal Your Freedom in Bankrupt America. But Matt Ryan for years,
[33:16.000 --> 33:21.360]  who's one of the TV slash radio board ops and producers, he worked at Austin Energy.
[33:23.040 --> 33:26.480]  And of course, he's talked about the meetings where they'd point out that the illegal aliens
[33:26.480 --> 33:31.520]  wouldn't pay their power bill. The city just said let them have free power. I've talked to Austin
[33:31.520 --> 33:37.520]  cops. They're ordered to let them go, DWI. That's a separate issue, though. But I walked out during
[33:37.520 --> 33:41.360]  the break and I said, well, the city didn't ask us here at our business. They came and stuck the
[33:41.360 --> 33:46.880]  new smart thermostat on last year. And in the brochure, it said, well, since your thermostat
[33:46.880 --> 33:54.240]  was free, businesses don't have an option, you know, free taxpayer paid for it. We may turn your
[33:54.240 --> 34:01.440]  heat down in the winter or your cool, you know, up in the summer if we're having problems supplying
[34:01.440 --> 34:06.080]  power. Now, that was the old Enron scam where they got caught to create artificial scarcity,
[34:06.080 --> 34:11.360]  where they were showing congressmen and the state legislature fake computer trades on computers.
[34:11.360 --> 34:16.160]  They were just making up the price and their internal studies showed if we double or triple
[34:16.160 --> 34:20.800]  prices or even turn power off, that creates the perception that it scares. And now they're doing
[34:20.800 --> 34:27.200]  it with the water, with power. This green movement is about raping you. But I briefly wanted Matt
[34:27.200 --> 34:32.560]  Ryan here on air. I mean, plus we can dig up the Austin Energy contract says it. I mean, I'd read
[34:32.560 --> 34:39.280]  this, but he goes, no, you're absolutely correct. Austin already has this. They already control
[34:39.280 --> 34:45.600]  this building's thermostat. I am under these criminals control. Matt Ryan, tell folks.
[34:45.600 --> 34:50.480]  Right. These programmable thermostats are one of the green initiatives sponsored by Austin Energy.
[34:50.480 --> 34:55.280]  You call them up. They'll give you a free thermostat, a programmable thermostat. It'll work for you
[34:55.280 --> 35:03.440]  24-7 around the clock, except during what they call peak usage times, which is a time period
[35:03.440 --> 35:07.760]  usually in the afternoon when they say, okay, well, there's a lot of people turning their ACs on.
[35:07.760 --> 35:12.080]  They can turn yours off and they will turn yours off for usually about 15 minutes
[35:13.360 --> 35:17.520]  during a day when they feel that they're having peak usage. And that's in the federal legislation
[35:17.520 --> 35:23.680]  to even control what goes in air conditioners. Just like your cell phone since 96 tracks you
[35:23.680 --> 35:28.240]  in real time, they're designing the big brother grid. But I want to tell you with this business,
[35:28.240 --> 35:33.120]  we don't have a choice. Right. They are our Lord and they are our king. I can't tell you how many
[35:33.120 --> 35:38.960]  times I got a call from an apartment tenant saying, why did y'all come out here and put this in? I do
[35:38.960 --> 35:43.760]  not want this meter in here. And it's their landlord that said, oh, programmable thermostats,
[35:43.760 --> 35:47.760]  that's a perk. We'll give it to all of our tenants. And whether they like it or not,
[35:47.760 --> 35:51.920]  and believe me, they would complain. They got an energy thermostat. I want to have you back
[35:51.920 --> 35:54.880]  and talk about this more in the future. I want to go back to Christopher Horner, but thank you for
[35:54.880 --> 36:00.400]  coming in and telling us. So Christopher Horner, here we are. I mean, I'm already under these
[36:00.400 --> 36:05.600]  people's control. And if they can naked body scan my kids to fly, if they can control the temperature
[36:05.600 --> 36:11.520]  in my office, I mean, literally, this is worse than the Soviet Union. What they're talking about is
[36:11.520 --> 36:16.640]  squeezing you at both ends. They're trying to ration the physical supply, create physical
[36:16.640 --> 36:20.400]  scarcity where there should not be any. Remember, the United States fits on the
[36:20.400 --> 36:25.520]  world's largest energy reserves. We don't have physical scarcity that would lead to this sort of,
[36:25.520 --> 36:29.920]  in essence, micro brownout. But you're going to get to the larger point of brownouts,
[36:29.920 --> 36:34.880]  because we're following the UK's path of saying, no coal, no nuclear, we'll just build off for a
[36:34.880 --> 36:38.800]  wind farm someday. And then you're going to see them obsessing about the fact when they get the
[36:38.800 --> 36:42.080]  Olympics, they're actually not going to have the electricity. But what you've got here is,
[36:42.080 --> 36:46.320]  Browner is saying things like, okay, this is not just the smart meter that will tell us when
[36:46.320 --> 36:50.960]  you're using your energy. What I guess this cat, he's always also invested in with this company,
[36:50.960 --> 36:56.480]  Landis and Gear, a Swiss smart meter company, half million dollars worth of stock, and just
[36:56.480 --> 37:00.960]  wait till she succeeds in getting those mandated in one of the biggest markets in the world.
[37:01.920 --> 37:06.000]  They're talking about also getting to the point, like Matt was discussing, whereby they can say,
[37:06.000 --> 37:11.280]  I'm sorry, you've been running your dishwasher too often, wrong time of day, close watchers,
[37:11.280 --> 37:17.280]  sorry. Carol Browner sold it in this interview to US News as a savings to the consumer. And I just
[37:17.280 --> 37:21.920]  want your listeners to know they're saving a fortune in India right now in Haiti and all over the
[37:21.920 --> 37:26.320]  world by not using energy. But we live in the richest country in the world sitting on top of
[37:26.320 --> 37:30.720]  the world's largest energy resources. But that means we have freedom and they don't like it.
[37:30.720 --> 37:36.240]  Ben Jones, the communist self about communist radical, he said the green as this is a quote,
[37:36.240 --> 37:40.720]  also in the book, among many others, the green economy will start off as a small subset,
[37:40.720 --> 37:46.160]  and we will push it and push it and push it until it becomes the engine for, wait for it,
[37:46.960 --> 37:52.480]  transforming the whole society. Yes, he said that. It always comes down to,
[37:52.480 --> 37:58.080]  this is the vehicle for doing to this terribly flawed transgressor of America that they have to
[37:58.080 --> 38:03.840]  fundamentally transform. This is the vehicle. This is the excuse. Your freedoms are simply
[38:03.840 --> 38:09.200]  nothing you can be trusted with. Meanwhile, in Ron, and of course, you briefly worked for him
[38:09.200 --> 38:14.640]  for about a month and you quit and exposed it all on record. And valiantly so, they wrote the cap
[38:14.640 --> 38:20.080]  and trade carbon tax fraud, literally made off level. Going back to California, they tried the
[38:20.080 --> 38:25.840]  same scam there. And in their memos, it said, we turn their power off, then they perceive it's
[38:25.840 --> 38:31.600]  more valuable. They'll put up with a triple, you know, price increase. Ha ha ha, we're raping these
[38:31.600 --> 38:36.880]  schmucks. I mean, so you've got the big money, it's just not free market money, who wants this
[38:36.880 --> 38:42.000]  government monopoly? I think that's the key to defeat these, these little green devils,
[38:42.000 --> 38:46.480]  is to expose that they could care less about the environment. This is all a way just to run
[38:46.480 --> 38:51.520]  everybody's lives. Yeah, the temperature after cap and trade will be, according to everybody,
[38:51.520 --> 38:56.240]  whatever it would have been. So we know it's not about that. Well, it's an excuse. And the point
[38:56.240 --> 38:59.520]  is the president comes out there and this is another quote. He said, some of America's biggest
[38:59.520 --> 39:03.680]  companies support this by way of things. So it must be a good idea. Of course, that's usually his
[39:03.680 --> 39:10.960]  position, right? You never, no one's ever asked publicly, okay, but why? Why is GE, which has
[39:10.960 --> 39:16.400]  Enron's old windmills, which nobody wants unless you mandate and heavily subsidize them? Why is
[39:16.400 --> 39:21.040]  the gas, did you know the gas industry is actually running these ads calling for more windmills?
[39:21.040 --> 39:26.640]  Because more windmills simply mean more gas. You can't really dial a coal plant up and down to
[39:26.640 --> 39:32.640]  meet the schizophrenia of the wind, but you can be more easily with gas. Oh yeah, they know the
[39:32.640 --> 39:38.880]  wind doesn't work, doesn't transfer the power. They love it because exactly the gas refining
[39:38.880 --> 39:44.000]  companies, they love it. They go, sure, idiots, get rid of coal. Shut down what produces 51%
[39:44.000 --> 39:51.120]  of our power. Shut down our competition. We love it. Well, you're right about creating artificial
[39:51.120 --> 39:57.440]  scarcity and the seeming paradox of it and business is pushing the idea of scarcity. But
[39:57.440 --> 40:02.560]  you also pointed out why businesses can benefit from scarcity. Now, what I did in the book is I
[40:02.560 --> 40:06.640]  pointed out, this is by no means, and it's obviously the world's second oldest profession,
[40:06.640 --> 40:13.120]  but this is also the very long history in the US. And there are left-wingers who point out
[40:13.120 --> 40:17.680]  that the history of the progressive movement was the corporate tie-ups to keep competition out,
[40:17.680 --> 40:22.480]  to lock in a nice livelihood for themselves with their buddies in government. And this is
[40:22.480 --> 40:27.920]  absolutely reminiscent of that for reasons I go into. And again, it started with the railroads
[40:27.920 --> 40:32.720]  and then various other industries. We've now got it with something extremely important to your
[40:32.720 --> 40:36.880]  lives and your family's lives and our national security and your family's security and that is
[40:36.880 --> 40:43.120]  energy. They're seeking to script scarcity, dangerous scarcity in the name of a bogeyman
[40:43.120 --> 40:47.760]  that keeps changing and now it's national security. But then they'll be the savior with your energy
[40:47.760 --> 40:53.440]  allotment of your poor. Once they make you poor, now you're dependent on them and you'll vote.
[40:53.440 --> 41:01.040]  You want power in the winter old lady? Vote to ban the Second Amendment. Well, I tell you this,
[41:01.040 --> 41:06.560]  this is a very big tent probably for a lot of reasons. There's a strange thing going on when
[41:06.560 --> 41:12.320]  you look at why are the population zealots so supportive of this? Why are the fallen communists
[41:12.320 --> 41:18.560]  so supportive? The persistent communists, the greens, the red, the pro-tax, the anti-development,
[41:18.560 --> 41:25.600]  there's a very broad coalition here that I want folks to think about this. Why is this extremely
[41:25.600 --> 41:29.920]  disparate group, along with some of, as the president said, America's biggest companies,
[41:29.920 --> 41:34.000]  pushing something, you're not at the table to get essentially screwed. They're negotiating
[41:34.000 --> 41:39.040]  you out of the deal, but at your expense. All of them have this agenda in common. Why? And the why
[41:39.040 --> 41:45.360]  is, again, the point of the book. This is a vehicle for their long-held wish list of organizing
[41:45.360 --> 41:50.400]  society. And there will be trade-offs, yes, involved, and your life will be very different. And
[41:50.400 --> 41:55.920]  when they orchestrate collapse on one level or another, it's true. They rush in with more
[41:55.920 --> 42:00.080]  state as the solution. Now, the president is lecturing Spain to cut it out right now,
[42:00.080 --> 42:03.840]  because he doesn't want them to drag us down, be the next grease, and drag us down with them,
[42:03.840 --> 42:08.960]  because he's got a fundamental transformation to impose here. But last week in a Spanish newspaper,
[42:08.960 --> 42:15.280]  like I said, there was a full-paged article, the headline of which was, quote, direct translation.
[42:15.280 --> 42:20.560]  Spain admits that green economy has sold to Obama is a disaster. Yeah, I saw that. So here's the
[42:20.560 --> 42:28.720]  deal. Their globalization, their command destruction, their neofutilism has been too good at destroying
[42:28.720 --> 42:33.760]  things. And so it's blowing up in their face before they get all the vice grips in place.
[42:33.760 --> 42:40.960]  I have to say that when the state controls power, the state controls an awful lot. And what this
[42:40.960 --> 42:46.800]  agenda does is transfer basic energy use and production and transmission, all these decisions
[42:46.800 --> 42:52.320]  from individuals, producers, and consumers to the state. And when you do that, you are giving up
[42:52.320 --> 42:56.720]  an awful lot of your liberties. Now, I married a European. She's from a country where they have
[42:56.720 --> 43:01.120]  a joke, at least they're still laughing for now, that it's a good thing we don't have all the cars
[43:01.120 --> 43:06.320]  we pay for. Where would we put them? What they mean by that in Denmark is, through the special
[43:06.320 --> 43:11.520]  assessment and the bad, they have doubled the price of cars there in order to force scarcity upon
[43:11.520 --> 43:16.320]  the public because it's a wealthy country and they would have all these cars. Oh, no. The
[43:16.320 --> 43:20.640]  status didn't care for that. And so what they did is they, in fact, doubled the price of a vehicle
[43:20.640 --> 43:25.200]  to force the population out of automobility. Now, when you start letting go of automobility,
[43:25.200 --> 43:30.640]  pretty soon you'll find yourself letting go of control of every basic decisions like the temp
[43:30.640 --> 43:35.280]  as you pointed out. Now, when you let go of things like this, please don't be surprised when you
[43:35.280 --> 43:40.640]  wake up one morning and there's an awful lot more that's just gone. Well, no, I mean, the social
[43:40.640 --> 43:46.480]  engineers admit that they want to have one child policy, that they want to decide what we're going
[43:46.480 --> 43:52.880]  to be when we grow up. They're literally organizing all of human society in a nightmarish way. I mean,
[43:52.880 --> 43:57.040]  we know when people try to organize things, you know, from top down, it always is a disaster,
[43:57.040 --> 44:00.640]  but, but they want to wreck things. And that's my next question to you because you're, you know,
[44:00.640 --> 44:06.560]  an insider really studies this. Every incumbent, whether the Republican or Democrat is being
[44:06.560 --> 44:10.320]  thrown out of office, whether it's Specter, whether it's what, you know, just happened
[44:10.320 --> 44:16.160]  congressional seat in Hawaii, whether it's Massachusetts, it doesn't matter. I've never
[44:16.160 --> 44:22.560]  seen such a realignment against the establishment. So they've really, you know, Obama was the fake
[44:22.560 --> 44:28.720]  revolution against Bush. Now people realize, my God, Obama is the real takeover. And so
[44:29.280 --> 44:33.360]  people are really, I mean, Zabigniew Brzezinski last week said, our global governance is in
[44:33.360 --> 44:38.080]  trouble. He said, the people have finally woken up worldwide do us. We're now in trouble. I don't
[44:38.080 --> 44:42.880]  know if you saw that speech, but, but, but they admit they're in trouble. How do you see them
[44:42.880 --> 44:49.840]  striking back or, or, or, I mean, because from every way I slice this, we are now really at the
[44:49.840 --> 44:54.960]  maker to break it crossroads. Well, there is a, there is a real push. And again, I was in the
[44:54.960 --> 45:00.240]  room in the Hague in November, 2000, when Jacques Chirac gave his speech calling Kyoto,
[45:00.240 --> 45:04.160]  the global warming treaty that covered 35 industrial titans like Iceland, Luxembourg,
[45:04.160 --> 45:09.520]  Belgium, Slovenia, Slovakia, but not China, India, Mexico, Brazil and so on. I was in the room with
[45:09.520 --> 45:13.040]  the members of Congress and a few other Americans who were the only ones surprised when Jacques
[45:13.040 --> 45:17.040]  Chirac, who at the time was the president of France, said Kyoto was the first component
[45:17.040 --> 45:22.000]  of an authentic global governance. Jim Sensenbrenner is a Wisconsin Republican who marched outside and
[45:22.000 --> 45:26.880]  held an impromptu press conference. Then I stood there watching the left-wing press swearing at
[45:26.880 --> 45:31.520]  him. The Guardian reporter was swearing bollocks at him. As Sensenbrenner said, if you want to
[45:31.520 --> 45:36.080]  keep us out of something, call it global governance. Well, I said the Guardian noted that
[45:36.080 --> 45:41.760]  Obama's diplomats were telling EU diplomats there may be a delay on Kyoto too in the United States
[45:41.760 --> 45:46.720]  because he's considering something called a congressional executive agreement. That was,
[45:46.720 --> 45:51.760]  I heard you mention NAFTA before, NAFTA is precedent. It's never been tried. The constitutionality
[45:51.760 --> 45:56.880]  of this, it did not get to this. But the issue of Congress waiving Article II, Section II,
[45:56.880 --> 46:02.720]  ratification, advice and consent, the two-thirds ratification, NAFTA was a treaty between three
[46:02.720 --> 46:07.200]  countries that Congress just said is not a treaty. And they granted something called fast-track
[46:07.200 --> 46:13.360]  authority, which is a suggestion of what should be in it and a promise to give it an up or down,
[46:13.360 --> 46:19.600]  no amendment, no filibuster, 50 plus one vote in both houses. Now, if you do this,
[46:19.600 --> 46:23.120]  and the administration apparently is telling Europeans, we may have to try this because
[46:23.120 --> 46:27.440]  we're going to call Kyoto II not a treaty. You're going to have a problem because it's
[46:27.440 --> 46:31.200]  then left up to the courts and you know how activist they become. But what you're talking
[46:31.200 --> 46:36.160]  about is you have one bite at the apple. Don't trust the courts. You saw campaign finance. Oh,
[46:36.160 --> 46:40.560]  don't worry, the court will fix it. Don't trust them. What you have to do is block it at the
[46:40.560 --> 46:46.480]  granting of fast-track for Kyoto II. They won't call it Kyoto II. They're going to call it
[46:46.480 --> 46:52.000]  Johannesburg because that's where the World Environment Summit is in 2012. They're actually
[46:52.000 --> 47:00.560]  going to try to get Kyoto II according to lefty advisors to Obama like this fellow Nigel Purvis
[47:00.560 --> 47:06.800]  who's counseling him just declared this next key global warming treaty not a treaty. It's got all,
[47:06.800 --> 47:11.760]  it quacks, flies and does everything. Oh, he's like a duck. But if you get Congress to say
[47:12.400 --> 47:16.880]  it's not a treaty, and the only difference is it means no tooth or ratification.
[47:17.360 --> 47:20.640]  Well, that's your one bite at the apple. The courts aren't going to help you,
[47:20.640 --> 47:24.880]  it's my guess. And you have a 50 plus one requirement and it would take,
[47:25.520 --> 47:30.240]  you know, you see income is being thrown out, but I just don't know given the way,
[47:30.880 --> 47:34.720]  you know, you didn't see the Democrats. So they're going to come at us with a violation of the
[47:34.720 --> 47:40.960]  Constitution and the Bill of Rights treason like this article. Top official says feds may not process
[47:40.960 --> 47:47.440]  illegals referred from Arizona. So, you know, citizens have no rights, but if illegal aliens get
[47:47.440 --> 47:52.000]  arrested, we won't pick them up. So it's the same thing here. The federal government doesn't care
[47:52.000 --> 47:58.240]  what we say or who we elect or what we do. They're just going to do it because they're God expanding
[47:58.240 --> 48:05.360]  on that. And, you know, trying to see where you see this going. What about the Republicans? I mean,
[48:06.000 --> 48:10.400]  you know, they've got a big hand in allowing this to happen as well. Yeah, you've got a problem.
[48:10.960 --> 48:16.320]  Right now, for example, this week, we're supposed to have a vote just across 51 or 50 votes, not
[48:16.320 --> 48:21.760]  60 saying EPA does not have the authority to do this through the back door. This, of course,
[48:21.760 --> 48:26.320]  came through the courts. It was a five, four decision we lost. I represented the skeptic
[48:26.320 --> 48:31.840]  scientists in this case, the Supreme Court ruled five to four in Massachusetts versus EPA saying
[48:31.840 --> 48:38.400]  EPA has the authority does not have to but has the authority to treat exhalation as pollution.
[48:38.400 --> 48:44.720]  Well, there's a resolution by Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and she's saying EPA does not
[48:44.720 --> 48:50.640]  even Congress is allowed to vote veto major rules within 60 days. And she's saying no,
[48:50.640 --> 48:54.800]  the problem is it has 41 co sponsors, three Democrats, and that means three Republicans
[48:54.800 --> 49:00.000]  have said no, they're from the Northeast to no surprise, Scott Brown and the ladies from Maine.
[49:00.000 --> 49:05.360]  Now Scott Brown during the campaign said climate changes, we all know this. What I don't want to
[49:05.360 --> 49:09.760]  do is something as big as what EPA is proposing or cap and trade without getting to the bottom of
[49:09.760 --> 49:13.520]  the scientific scandals. Well, I assure you, we've not gotten to the bottom of the scientific
[49:13.520 --> 49:18.640]  scandals. I submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to the University of Virginia on Friday.
[49:18.640 --> 49:23.280]  I'm not sure how far we'll get, but we will litigate it. We're suing NASA probably this week
[49:23.280 --> 49:27.520]  for our own climate change. We're pushing this, but right now we've already got three Republicans
[49:27.520 --> 49:33.840]  in the Senate who have not cosponsored a bill to say EPA will not do this to the back door.
[49:33.840 --> 49:39.120]  Instead, the world's greatest deliberative body, why we shall deliberate on what will be the biggest
[49:39.120 --> 49:43.600]  intervention in our economy and our history. And you have three Republicans not just cosponsoring
[49:43.600 --> 49:49.120]  this thing. You need to shut down the business of the Senate if the administration tries to do
[49:49.120 --> 49:53.280]  this to the back door. And three Republicans have not cosponsored it. Is that why they're so scared
[49:53.280 --> 49:58.160]  to Rand Paul? Because he gave that speech saying, we're not going to let you use fake
[49:58.160 --> 50:04.160]  environmentalism to shut our economy down? I'm sure he troubles some by pointing some things
[50:04.160 --> 50:09.360]  out. I was told by the Spanish Green Jobs professor, Dr. Calzada, in an email that Rand Paul,
[50:09.360 --> 50:13.680]  in one of his acceptance speeches, pointed out that there's a new steel mill in Kentucky,
[50:13.680 --> 50:17.680]  the North American Stainless Plant with 175 workers. I write about this in my book,
[50:17.680 --> 50:22.800]  PowerGrab, in which those steel workers are jobs that are sent from Spain. Because of
[50:22.800 --> 50:26.960]  cap and trade and green jobs schemes, the CEO was very clear. He said, you can make windmills
[50:26.960 --> 50:32.320]  out of steel, but you can't make steel using windmills. I'm paraphrasing. But Rand Paul pointed
[50:32.320 --> 50:36.480]  this out, and I don't think people in Washington like to hear the idea that the state is not responsible
[50:36.480 --> 50:45.840]  for economic growth. Yeah, I mean, the grass grows, the sky is blue, the sun comes up in the morning
[50:45.840 --> 50:53.120]  because, because Barack Obama reads off a teleprompter. Stay there. Final segment with our guest,
[50:53.120 --> 50:58.080]  the new book. I've got to read it. PowerGrab, how Obama's green policies will steal your freedom

[52:03.360 --> 52:10.240]  draw their line in the sand? What have we got? A republic or a monarchy? A republic is based on
[52:10.240 --> 52:15.360]  a constitution which protects minority rights. Not democracy, not mob rule, two wolves and a
[52:15.360 --> 52:19.680]  sheep voting on what's for dinner. So they think they own our land, they think they're on our water,
[52:19.680 --> 52:26.240]  children, our education, our money. We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[52:26.240 --> 52:31.200]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot uprising. You have been warned.
[52:31.200 --> 52:34.960]  We have the facts. We have the constitution. We have the Bill of Rights. We have common
[52:34.960 --> 52:39.600]  law. Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm so excited to be able to offer you.

[54:34.480 --> 54:40.480]  possible. So you've got big mega corporations in bed with government to create monopolies. As John
[54:40.480 --> 54:47.120]  D. Rockefeller the first said, competition is a sin. And this will destroy our free market system
[54:47.120 --> 54:51.440]  that's made this nation so great. Has nothing to do with the environment. Chris, we were talking
[54:51.440 --> 54:56.880]  during the break and you've played, you know, many times before the Supreme Court, the arrogance
[54:56.880 --> 55:03.600]  level though. I mean, I don't see Republicans opposing Elena Kagan who was like Joe Stalin
[55:03.600 --> 55:07.440]  in drag or something. And then I was talking to you about what's happening with BP and,
[55:08.080 --> 55:12.560]  you know, it just seems like it's a lawlessness. But give us your take on that in closing.
[55:12.560 --> 55:17.440]  Well, what we said before going out last time was the idea to many elected officials that
[55:17.440 --> 55:22.400]  Washington is not responsible for economic growth is an aftermath here. So somebody like Rand Paul
[55:22.400 --> 55:27.440]  who's going to come up and say those things is going to be a troublemaker and isolated. You've
[55:27.440 --> 55:32.800]  got companies like BP who choose, remember their favorite politician in the last two decades was
[55:32.800 --> 55:38.560]  Barack Obama, a guy who swore to cause your listeners energy prices to skyrocket. BP had no
[55:38.560 --> 55:43.760]  problem with that. Obama swore he had no problem with high gas prices. He just said they shouldn't
[55:43.760 --> 55:49.680]  go up too fast for the obvious reason. People will start calling for policies that will allow us
[55:49.680 --> 55:53.680]  greater access to the greatest energy reserves in the world. So you've got a problem with these
[55:53.680 --> 55:57.680]  companies like BP that are a bit, look, they can have their public spats now, but it's not
[55:57.680 --> 56:04.640]  that much of a spat. BP remains in bed mostly with the left, sometimes with the right in Washington
[56:04.640 --> 56:09.440]  style, right? Because they, like Enron, lost the plot. They began as an energy company and then
[56:09.440 --> 56:13.120]  they started to try to make money off of derivatives and windmills and solar panels
[56:13.120 --> 56:18.000]  and pushing paper and not making anything. They tried to make money off of doing nothing.
[56:18.000 --> 56:22.640]  Now, a couple of months after I left Enron in 97, there was an Oval Office meeting,
[56:22.640 --> 56:29.440]  August 4, 1997, Sir John Brown of BP and Ken Lay from Enron with the President of the United States
[56:29.440 --> 56:36.080]  and the Vice President, Al Gore. And on August 1, 1997, a Friday in preparation for the Monday
[56:36.080 --> 56:40.720]  Oval Office meeting, there was a briefing memo written for Ken Lay, which is available online
[56:40.720 --> 56:46.000]  at masterresource.org. You can find it. In it, they say, okay, the unanimous Senate, I mean,
[56:46.000 --> 56:50.160]  the context was a week or so before the Senate had unanimous said, don't go to Kyoto and do this.
[56:50.720 --> 56:55.360]  So these two fellows, Ken Lay and John Brown of BP, go into the Oval Office and they say,
[56:55.360 --> 57:00.000]  ignore that Senate. You got to go to Kyoto and you got to do it and here's what it has to be.
[57:00.720 --> 57:05.440]  And since, obviously, we know who won that one. There's a memo also available at Master Resource
[57:05.440 --> 57:11.600]  and I discussed it in my book from Ken Lay's Kyoto advisor from Kyoto, five months later,
[57:11.600 --> 57:16.240]  saying this treaty is exactly what we've been loving for. So the unanimous Senate gets ignored
[57:16.240 --> 57:20.400]  when they say, look, you know, we go along with a lot, but not there. Not what Jacques
[57:20.400 --> 57:24.960]  Charrot calls global governance, not an obvious wealth transfer, not obviously rashing energy here.
[57:24.960 --> 57:29.040]  How has the Senate changed, though? I mean, they can see that everything Obama's doing is political
[57:29.040 --> 57:33.280]  suicide. And still, it looks like they'll be able to pass it. I mean, are they all bought off?
[57:33.280 --> 57:37.440]  Are they blackmailed? What's going on? Well, Lindsey Graham's got so much pushback. He was
[57:37.440 --> 57:41.280]  the test case and now the folks in the South Carolina aren't happy with him. And so he says,
[57:41.280 --> 57:45.280]  he'll vote for it, but he won't be a coast spot. They're saying, look, progress. I know, if the
[57:45.280 --> 57:48.960]  Cap Yenberger said about they taught, if this is progress, we can't afford much more progress,
[57:48.960 --> 57:54.560]  but you start setting some examples here. When Democrats are running as anti-cap traders,
[57:54.560 --> 57:58.960]  as happened in the Pennsylvania race in which they succeeded, when Scott Brown wins Massachusetts,
[57:58.960 --> 58:03.760]  saying in Cambridge that, no, no, no, you don't do this to get to the bottom of what stinks.
[58:03.760 --> 58:07.680]  Of course, we don't know where he's going to vote on this thing. You are turning a very big ship
[58:07.680 --> 58:12.080]  of status and trying to steal your liberty, but brief that book and listen to what they're saying.
[58:12.080 --> 58:15.680]  No, no, I agree with you. I mean, we're having victories that they're having to bait and switch
[58:15.680 --> 58:20.960]  now and aren't calling it cap and trade. Amazing. Christopher Horner, thank you for coming on with
[58:20.960 --> 58:26.960]  us. The book is PowerGrab, in stores all over, CEI.org. We'll talk to you again soon.
[58:26.960 --> 58:32.720]  Thanks, Alex. You bet. I'm out of time. Retransmission starts now, ladies and gentlemen,

[58:50.320 --> 58:54.960]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds
[58:54.960 --> 58:59.040]  in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[58:59.040 --> 59:03.600]  non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true, seeds have all performed
[59:03.600 --> 59:07.760]  even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[59:07.760 --> 59:13.040]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[59:13.040 --> 59:18.960]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food
[59:18.960 --> 59:22.720]  for you and your family. And here's the best part. These seeds have not been genetically
[59:22.720 --> 59:28.560]  modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full-acre crisis garden. So visit
[59:28.560 --> 59:37.920]  them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[59:37.920 --> 59:44.480]  That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis,
[59:44.480 --> 59:49.520]  non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[59:49.520 --> 59:57.840]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[1:00:21.680 --> 1:00:26.800]  It is Thursday, the 27th day of May, 2010. Thank you so much for joining us.
[1:00:26.800 --> 1:00:30.320]  We're into the second hour. We're now assemble casting the last three hours
[1:00:30.320 --> 1:00:35.200]  at PrisonPlanet.tv. I want to say a great job to my crew here. They just do a better and better
[1:00:35.200 --> 1:00:40.000]  job exemplary. We couldn't do it without them, and of course, you, the listeners, AM and FM
[1:00:40.000 --> 1:00:48.960]  affiliates, sponsors, and all of our supporters. Dr. Paul Craig Roberts quit doing his twice a week
[1:00:48.960 --> 1:00:54.000]  column and said he wanted to take some time off, but I knew a fighter for liberty. I knew he wasn't
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:58.400]  going away. So I called him up a few months ago and I said, look, you can take some time for
[1:00:58.400 --> 1:01:03.040]  yourself. You're not going anywhere. Somebody that loves liberty can't control themselves.
[1:01:03.760 --> 1:01:07.760]  And so it's good to have him, but he has cut back on what he's been doing, but it's great to
[1:01:07.760 --> 1:01:11.840]  have him with us. And I was glad to get an email from him pointing out, hey, look at how there's
[1:01:11.840 --> 1:01:16.720]  all this evidence that our government now been declassified knowingly, many times has left POWs
[1:01:16.720 --> 1:01:22.480]  behind, not just in Vietnam, not just Korea, but World War II. What does this say about the mindset
[1:01:22.480 --> 1:01:27.120]  of the elite? And so he wanted to come on and talk about that. We're always honored to have him,
[1:01:27.760 --> 1:01:31.600]  but we'll cover about 20, 30 minutes on that. Then I want to pick his brain because he is the
[1:01:31.600 --> 1:01:35.520]  father of economics. He is one of the top 10 living economists, according to Forbes,
[1:01:35.520 --> 1:01:39.760]  another major publications. He's won some of the biggest honors from the French U.S.
[1:01:39.760 --> 1:01:43.600]  British government. He is the best-selling author, former editor of the Wall Street Journal. So I
[1:01:43.600 --> 1:01:48.240]  want to get into North Korea. I ran with him. I want to get into the economy. I mean, they're
[1:01:48.240 --> 1:01:52.640]  openly talking about worldwide meltdown now all over the news. And of course, he talked about this
[1:01:52.640 --> 1:01:57.600]  years ago via the derivatives and everything. So we're going to talk about it all with Dr. Paul
[1:01:57.600 --> 1:02:04.880]  Craig Roberts in the next hour. Doc, it's good to have you here with us. Hi, Alex. You look good
[1:02:04.880 --> 1:02:11.680]  there via Skype video feed. Right. Well, thank you. So much is going on. So much is happening,
[1:02:11.680 --> 1:02:17.200]  but we're going to break in a few minutes. But get into this whole POW situation and your research
[1:02:17.200 --> 1:02:25.840]  on that. Well, you know, it's not my research. It's in the Schrenberg, the Pulitzer Prize-winning
[1:02:26.560 --> 1:02:35.280]  New York Times reporter and editor. He has proven beyond all doubt and presents all the evidence
[1:02:35.280 --> 1:02:45.520]  that American prisoners of war were left behind in Vietnam. So that's a scandal. The second scandal
[1:02:45.520 --> 1:02:56.000]  is that every administration since Richard Nixon's has continued to cover up. And the third scandal
[1:02:56.000 --> 1:03:03.040]  is that despite his high standing in journalism and all the prizes and the Pulitzer Prize and his
[1:03:03.040 --> 1:03:09.440]  high post at the New York Times, he was never allowed to write the story. And so it only came out
[1:03:10.480 --> 1:03:15.920]  in an out of the way publication a year or two ago, about two years ago. Yeah, we actually
[1:03:15.920 --> 1:03:19.600]  interviewed the folks involved at the time. In fact, I think I even interviewed him. In fact,
[1:03:19.600 --> 1:03:26.000]  let's get him back on or some of the families involved. But the issue is when I say your
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:30.720]  research, I'm saying, you know, you're you're writing about this now, how this your research
[1:03:30.720 --> 1:03:39.600]  into how this ties in to the mindset of the ruling class. Yes. Yes. I think that now that we have
[1:03:39.600 --> 1:03:48.240]  definite proof from a very credible source of Sydney Schrenberg, that the United States government
[1:03:48.240 --> 1:03:56.960]  conducted a conspiracy since the 1970s to hide the fact that they abandoned American prisoners
[1:03:56.960 --> 1:04:06.560]  of war to the North Vietnamese. This is now proven. This might make Americans wonder if other so
[1:04:06.560 --> 1:04:15.600]  called conspiracy theories are also true, such as the theory that 9 11 was an inside job or a
[1:04:15.600 --> 1:04:26.160]  false flag operation. The it might make people wonder if the Warren Commission's account of
[1:04:26.160 --> 1:04:33.520]  Kennedy's assassination was just another cover up. The same for Robert Kennedy's assassination.
[1:04:33.520 --> 1:04:38.320]  Well, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, stay there when we come back. Let's go through this Pulitzer prize
[1:04:38.320 --> 1:04:45.360]  winners piece, recap it, go through the piece and then let's expand into the mindset of an
[1:04:45.360 --> 1:04:51.600]  establishment why they would do such a thing. We'll be right back with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[1:04:51.600 --> 1:05:04.160]  Stay with us. When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[1:05:05.360 --> 1:05:10.480]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[1:05:10.480 --> 1:05:20.800]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans. They so pride in every
[1:05:20.800 --> 1:05:30.960]  stitch guarantee you love the way they fit. They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need
[1:05:30.960 --> 1:05:44.080]  most. We turn jeans inside out diamond gusset jeans made in the USA with unparalleled quality.

[1:06:02.400 --> 1:06:09.200]  Tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality. It really says that the state
[1:06:09.200 --> 1:06:14.160]  is God. The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police
[1:06:14.160 --> 1:06:20.160]  states on earth. This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps
[1:06:20.160 --> 1:06:25.600]  now being expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program
[1:06:25.600 --> 1:06:30.640]  has established an old powerful shadow state. Police state four chronicles the sickening depth
[1:06:30.640 --> 1:06:36.720]  to which our republic has fallen. Prepare to enter the secret of world of emergency dictatorship.
[1:06:36.720 --> 1:06:42.640]  Body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[1:06:42.640 --> 1:06:48.160]  It's only the beginning of the new world order's hellish plan. The police state isn't coming.

[1:07:02.560 --> 1:07:08.000]  battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be
[1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:14.000]  all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones. Food is your only ammunition.
[1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:19.280]  How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it?
[1:07:19.280 --> 1:07:23.920]  Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children
[1:07:23.920 --> 1:07:28.480]  sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[1:07:28.480 --> 1:07:33.920]  and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply. Food is your
[1:07:33.920 --> 1:07:39.120]  ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know.
[1:07:39.120 --> 1:07:44.160]  How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live to
[1:07:44.160 --> 1:07:53.120]  fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com. Again,
[1:07:53.120 --> 1:08:04.400]  that number 1-800-409-5633. From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines,
[1:08:04.400 --> 1:08:10.000]  the information war continues. It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:17.600]  You call it synchronicity, serendipity, I don't know, but back on Monday and Tuesday,
[1:08:17.600 --> 1:08:26.400]  I talked quite a bit about the fact that it was actually declassified that 20 plus thousand,
[1:08:26.400 --> 1:08:33.600]  21,500 or so US troops that were in Eastern European, Nazi held POW camps and German camps
[1:08:33.600 --> 1:08:38.960]  that were grabbed by Stalin. The US and England wanted to be buddies with Stalin. They divided
[1:08:38.960 --> 1:08:44.800]  up Eastern Europe and he was a thug and kept him for intelligence purposes and they just let him
[1:08:44.800 --> 1:08:50.240]  keep him. And a few years ago, that actually even came out in Russian newspapers. Old Americans,
[1:08:50.240 --> 1:08:56.800]  World War II vets, 80 plus years old, still alive in Russia. And it's been confirmed with Korea.
[1:08:56.800 --> 1:09:01.040]  It's been confirmed with Vietnam. We've had the families on. They've had congressional hearings
[1:09:01.040 --> 1:09:07.360]  that the media doesn't cover. They've had national press club meetings. But then when I got an email
[1:09:07.360 --> 1:09:12.160]  a few days ago from Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, father of Reaganomics, former head of policy
[1:09:12.160 --> 1:09:17.440]  department of treasury under Reagan, well, former Wall Street Journal editor pointing out that he
[1:09:17.440 --> 1:09:24.640]  was going to write an article dealing with the fact that if it's a Pulitzer prize winning New
[1:09:24.640 --> 1:09:30.880]  York Times editor for years, isn't allowed to publish in a mainstream publication, his research
[1:09:30.880 --> 1:09:36.960]  that's ironclad that this is all confirmed. I mean, it's ridiculous how confirmed it is. It's
[1:09:36.960 --> 1:09:42.720]  like confirming that Mount St. Helens blew up in the early 1980s. It's a fact it happened. Or that,
[1:09:42.720 --> 1:09:50.880]  you know, the first creature in space was a dog from Russia. It's a fact. And, you know, the angle.
[1:09:51.680 --> 1:09:55.040]  And of course, Roberts wasn't listening to me. He separately put two and two together because
[1:09:55.040 --> 1:09:59.680]  we're all having these same understandings that if they'll if they'll leave our troops to die,
[1:09:59.680 --> 1:10:04.480]  or if they'll, it's like Doug Rocky I've had on, he was the head of the DU program for more than
[1:10:04.480 --> 1:10:09.760]  a decade. He wrote the handbooks for the Pentagon in the 80s. They knew DU would kill anybody
[1:10:10.720 --> 1:10:16.880]  collectively that breathed it. And they just in the mid 90s changed the rules and said it's
[1:10:16.880 --> 1:10:21.920]  now good for you. No problem. And the State Department says it's a conspiracy theory on their
[1:10:21.920 --> 1:10:28.000]  website. If you say it's bad, I mean, they absolutely know you breathe this, the particulate,
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:32.720]  the radiation, it's going to kill you. I mean, it's going to, you know, may take a few years,
[1:10:32.720 --> 1:10:41.040]  but you're dead. Now they just say it's good for you. This shows you the mindset and I like
[1:10:41.040 --> 1:10:45.600]  in it and we're going to Dr. Roberts. I want to make this point to chess being invented three
[1:10:45.600 --> 1:10:51.200]  and a half thousand years ago in Northern India and I and what's Iran today. They debate who invented
[1:10:51.200 --> 1:10:57.200]  it, but it came from that area. And in it, you have the gambit, the sacrifice of a pawn.
[1:10:58.160 --> 1:11:01.600]  That's a good move early on, you know, in basic chess. I'm not a good chess player,
[1:11:01.600 --> 1:11:07.120]  but I play some sacrificing a pawn. And it's a special forces tactic in the books. It's
[1:11:07.120 --> 1:11:13.040]  taught at West Point. Send in, you know, 20 guys first to go last to know they're going to get
[1:11:13.040 --> 1:11:18.000]  wiped out, but that's going to bring in the enemy into the gorge. That will then reveal their positions.
[1:11:18.560 --> 1:11:23.040]  And you can then wipe out the larger force. And the argument is you lose 20 men, but you
[1:11:23.040 --> 1:11:28.560]  save thousands in the battle by losing the 20 men. So that's why they stage 9 11. That's why
[1:11:28.560 --> 1:11:33.760]  they say, so what, 21,000 US troops, give them a Stalin. That's why they say, you know, hundreds
[1:11:33.760 --> 1:11:37.840]  and hundreds of US troops was thousands, most of them dead, you know, let them be slaves,
[1:11:37.840 --> 1:11:46.240]  let them be tortured to death for 30 years in Vietnam. It's the gambit. And that's the beginning
[1:11:46.240 --> 1:11:52.160]  of evil. That's why special forces, people before they graduate, they are given for Delta force
[1:11:52.160 --> 1:11:57.600]  level. They're given one night to read the prince by Machiavelli and then to write a paper.
[1:11:57.600 --> 1:12:01.840]  And if they say, I believe the injustice defies the means, they go, you're the man we're looking
[1:12:01.840 --> 1:12:07.440]  for. You're now recruited. If they say, no, I won't kill children. This is now an army manual
[1:12:07.440 --> 1:12:12.080]  declassified last year. Well, it was leaked by WikiLeaks from 2004, where it talks about staging
[1:12:12.080 --> 1:12:15.680]  false flag terror attacks. One of the favorites is to kill children, blame on the foreign enemy.
[1:12:15.680 --> 1:12:19.840]  Captains and above in black ops are now taught this. And the argument is, well, we're fighting
[1:12:19.840 --> 1:12:23.920]  Commies or we're fighting Muslims. They're going to kill more children if we don't kill a few,
[1:12:23.920 --> 1:12:27.920]  you know, for the overall good. And that's kind of the straight razor, you know, statement in
[1:12:27.920 --> 1:12:33.760]  apocalypse. Now, where Colonel Kurtz is talking about what he's had to do to win. And so this
[1:12:33.760 --> 1:12:40.400]  is the mindset of you in justifies the means. Now, I'm going to shut up and have Dr. Paul
[1:12:40.400 --> 1:12:47.040]  Craig Roberts go over, you know, this two year old information. The nation Institute reported
[1:12:47.040 --> 1:12:55.120]  it McCain and the POW coverup. And this was written by a Pulitzer prize winner, but completely a
[1:12:55.120 --> 1:13:00.160]  news blackout in the US. Dr. Roberts, thanks for holding while I did that backstory. You've got
[1:13:00.160 --> 1:13:05.360]  the floor. Well, let's first tell your listeners, well, they can read the account. It's now,
[1:13:05.360 --> 1:13:10.000]  it came out yesterday in the American conservative. And so you'll have an account
[1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:17.200]  by the publisher of the magazine. You'll have an account by Schranberg of why he was unable to tell
[1:13:17.200 --> 1:13:25.440]  the story. And then you have the story itself and the evidence and presents all the evidence.
[1:13:25.440 --> 1:13:32.640]  And then they have a few people discussing the story. Now, it's also I think this morning,
[1:13:32.640 --> 1:13:39.680]  it was all put up on anti war.com. And I'm sure you'll have it up on on your site.
[1:13:39.680 --> 1:13:46.560]  So so that people can see that what was branded a conspiracy theory for several decades
[1:13:47.600 --> 1:13:51.280]  by the government, by the media, by all the mainstream establishment,
[1:13:52.240 --> 1:13:58.240]  they they got rid of the POW issue by calling it a conspiracy theory. It's now been proven
[1:13:58.240 --> 1:14:04.080]  beyond all doubt that the conspiracy theory was true. The POWs were abandoned.
[1:14:04.080 --> 1:14:12.400]  And there was a cover up by the United States government that continues to this day. It's just
[1:14:12.400 --> 1:14:20.160]  like the cover up of the Israeli attack on the USS Liberty. This was said to have been
[1:14:20.160 --> 1:14:25.280]  some kind of an accident and mistaken identity of the ship. And that's been covered up ever
[1:14:25.280 --> 1:14:34.400]  since the 1960s. So we do have government cover ups, the government that commits great acts of
[1:14:34.400 --> 1:14:42.240]  evil. I mean, what's more despicable than abandoning your own POWs? And they could have got the POWs
[1:14:42.240 --> 1:14:49.920]  back. All they had to do was to pay ransom. The North Koreans held back half of the prisoners,
[1:14:49.920 --> 1:14:57.520]  about 600 of them, in order to collect reparations for all the bombing the Americans had done to
[1:14:57.520 --> 1:15:04.880]  North Vietnam. And so they were willing to give the prisoners back if we would pay three or four
[1:15:04.880 --> 1:15:14.160]  billion dollars in ransom. And of course, by that time, Nixon was too weak to deliver the money,
[1:15:14.160 --> 1:15:23.280]  Watergate was consuming him. And once a lie gets in place, it can't be undone. It wasn't possible
[1:15:23.280 --> 1:15:28.960]  for the next president to say, Hey, look, we can get they do have our prisoners and we can get them
[1:15:28.960 --> 1:15:35.600]  back for a little bit of money. So once allies in place, everyone ends up defending it. Even
[1:15:35.600 --> 1:15:43.280]  the Reagan administration ended up defending the claim that all the prisoners were back. So
[1:15:43.280 --> 1:15:50.640]  here we see a government that lies through its teeth about its prisoners that it abandoned
[1:15:51.440 --> 1:15:56.880]  and could have gotten back for very little money. So why does the guy why do we believe the government
[1:15:56.880 --> 1:16:06.400]  tells us the truth about anything? And why do we think the media would possibly serve the people
[1:16:06.400 --> 1:16:13.200]  by delivering the truth when they prevented Schranberg from ever publishing his account? I mean,
[1:16:13.200 --> 1:16:18.560]  he had to sit on this account for years and years until finally, it got out and some out of the
[1:16:18.560 --> 1:16:25.920]  way place. And now it's become news. Thanks to Ron, aunts, aunts, the publisher of the American
[1:16:25.920 --> 1:16:31.040]  conservative, who's making an issue out of it. And of course, you've made an issue out of it.
[1:16:31.040 --> 1:16:39.840]  And so what I think might be hopeful about it is that it makes people see if the government
[1:16:39.840 --> 1:16:46.320]  will lie about this, they'll lie about 9 11. They'll lie about Kennedy's assassination. In fact,
[1:16:46.320 --> 1:16:50.800]  they lie about everything. Don't the Alex they lie about the unemployment rate. They lie about
[1:16:50.800 --> 1:16:56.960]  the inflation rate. They lie about the bank bailout. What does the government not lie about?
[1:16:56.960 --> 1:17:01.520]  Well, here's another example. I mean, I had a congressman on more than 10 years ago from Virginia
[1:17:01.520 --> 1:17:07.040]  who was upset about six years ago. I had a member of the Australian parliament on who was upset.
[1:17:07.040 --> 1:17:12.800]  It was in the Australian news. They were saying there's a secret UN database of all our kids blood.
[1:17:12.800 --> 1:17:20.480]  The government's been taking the blood since 1971, 72. It was a worldwide program in Western
[1:17:20.480 --> 1:17:26.880]  countries. And they put it in a database and I would have these people on and read the documents
[1:17:26.880 --> 1:17:31.600]  and listeners wouldn't believe me. Now it's all over the news. Oh, guess what? The Pentagon's got
[1:17:31.600 --> 1:17:37.680]  your blood of your 38 years old or younger. That's how criminal this group is and how this
[1:17:37.680 --> 1:17:43.360]  national security state basically does whatever they want. That imagine that, Dr. Roberts, for 38
[1:17:43.360 --> 1:17:49.360]  years from Australia to Canada, from England to the US, they take our blood to put it in a government
[1:17:49.360 --> 1:17:53.680]  database. And now they announced, guess what? We're going to have a global DNA database and we
[1:17:53.680 --> 1:17:59.200]  already have your blood. I mean, it's just everything is a conspiracy basically. It does
[1:17:59.200 --> 1:18:04.880]  look that way. It doesn't, Alex. It does. I mean, it's incredible. But see, the one advantage of
[1:18:04.880 --> 1:18:14.160]  this conspiracy now has been blown wide open. And therefore, it may help make people aware
[1:18:14.160 --> 1:18:20.240]  that the other conspiracies are true, too. Well, exactly, expanding on that briefly. I mean, your
[1:18:20.240 --> 1:18:25.040]  point is well taken and it's central. It's not just that they did this. It's the 30 years of
[1:18:25.040 --> 1:18:31.360]  coverups and not letting Pulitzer Prize winners ride on it. And now that story is as big as the
[1:18:31.360 --> 1:18:37.200]  POW story that you have a giant group of people in media and government who would work together
[1:18:37.200 --> 1:18:44.960]  to leave a bunch of men to die. I mean, it's why. Right. And of course, the same group, the same
[1:18:44.960 --> 1:18:51.840]  people are doing the same thing now. They're leading us deeper into wars, deeper into confrontation
[1:18:51.840 --> 1:18:59.680]  with nuclear armed powers. The evil is loose, as you said, evil is loose in the United States.
[1:18:59.680 --> 1:19:07.120]  It's got an iron grip on the government and probably on government at most levels in most places.
[1:19:07.920 --> 1:19:14.560]  So it is a very serious situation and it remains to be seen if the people wake up or enough of them
[1:19:14.560 --> 1:19:20.720]  wake up. And if they do, whether they have the capability of doing anything about it or whether
[1:19:20.720 --> 1:19:28.880]  they are just going to be pawns that are continued to be sacrificed so that a very small group of
[1:19:28.880 --> 1:19:35.280]  elites who control the government can achieve some agenda of their own. Well, sir, let's continue
[1:19:35.280 --> 1:19:39.520]  and talk about how big this story is and how important maybe go over some of the sections.
[1:19:39.520 --> 1:19:44.960]  Anywar.com probably got 15 articles about it and documents. The Nation Institute has them.
[1:19:46.400 --> 1:19:53.600]  The American Conservative has it. We're getting it all up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[1:19:53.600 --> 1:19:56.640]  Stay there, sir. I'm glad you contacted us about this. Thank you.

[1:24:06.960 --> 1:24:15.120]  Alexander Cockburn, a former LA Times senior writer. He's got an article out today on Andy War
[1:24:15.120 --> 1:24:20.880]  saying sometimes conspiracy theories are true. Look, they just call it a conspiracy theory
[1:24:21.440 --> 1:24:28.560]  when you say that they're lying. I mean, it wasn't a conspiracy theory in 1964 when people started
[1:24:28.560 --> 1:24:35.120]  saying our ships weren't attacked. That was staged to Gulf of Tonkin. It was in the San Diego
[1:24:35.120 --> 1:24:39.760]  newspaper. We've gone and gotten the microfilm that sailors came back and said we weren't attacked.
[1:24:39.760 --> 1:24:44.800]  It's all a lie. It was in the newspaper, but then it becomes a rumor. Oh, I heard it was
[1:24:44.800 --> 1:24:54.400]  staged. Well, see now it's declassified. After 40 plus years on the anniversary of it in 2004,
[1:24:55.120 --> 1:25:02.240]  40 plus, I guess that's the, yeah, 40 anniversary, they declassified that they staged it. Going back
[1:25:02.240 --> 1:25:08.720]  to Dr. Paul Craig Roberts. As you said, though, the fact that you have such a huge cover-up
[1:25:08.720 --> 1:25:16.480]  shows that they've got a lot of willing people that will be part of this evil. Talk about that,
[1:25:16.480 --> 1:25:20.880]  Dr. Roberts, but also why would they want to lie and not get our troops back?
[1:25:22.480 --> 1:25:29.280]  Okay, those are all good questions. First, let me say that one of the, one of the many
[1:25:29.280 --> 1:25:35.840]  important contributions Schranberg makes is he shows how the government lies. He shows
[1:25:35.840 --> 1:25:44.240]  the technique, how they do it, how they get rid of conclusive evidence. And so that itself is
[1:25:44.240 --> 1:25:51.280]  very revealing. And your listeners should read just to see how the government goes about burying
[1:25:51.840 --> 1:25:59.200]  the truth. We got plenty of time. Boil it down. Well, the specific examples are given by Schranberg
[1:25:59.200 --> 1:26:05.440]  and it's best for them to read. Now to get to your questions, interestingly enough,
[1:26:05.440 --> 1:26:12.400]  there were two American defense secretaries, James Schlesinger, who was actually one of my
[1:26:12.400 --> 1:26:21.040]  graduate professors in economics, and Melvin Laird, who both testified under oath to Congress that
[1:26:21.040 --> 1:26:28.080]  men were left behind. So even when two defense secretaries, and of course Melvin Laird was
[1:26:28.080 --> 1:26:33.600]  the secretary of defense during the Nixon period when the Vietnam War was wound down,
[1:26:33.600 --> 1:26:42.480]  so he certainly would know and Schlesinger came not long after. So we have two defense secretaries
[1:26:42.480 --> 1:26:47.280]  who did testify to Congress that men were left behind, but Congress didn't want to hear it.
[1:26:47.280 --> 1:26:53.760]  They didn't want to do anything about it. And there are a number of defense secretaries,
[1:26:54.720 --> 1:27:00.880]  as Schranberg shows, who come into office who just immediately take up the lie because their
[1:27:00.880 --> 1:27:08.000]  notion is it's my career. I'm serving my career and I'm not going to go against whatever the line is.
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:13.040]  And who cares if men are still rotting and being used as slaves, which has been confirmed. There's
[1:27:13.040 --> 1:27:19.600]  some still alive being worked to death as slaves and these fat, lazy, evil congressmen, just they're
[1:27:19.600 --> 1:27:26.080]  pigs. Pigs, they're the scum of the earth. In fact, the United States government is a scum of the
[1:27:26.080 --> 1:27:32.480]  earth. The worst people in the country are in the government. They're not the criminals out there,
[1:27:32.480 --> 1:27:38.720]  they're not even the terrorists. The worst people are in the government. And that is another reason,
[1:27:38.720 --> 1:27:45.840]  I think, that Schranberg's story is so explosive because Americans don't want to come to grips
[1:27:45.840 --> 1:27:51.760]  with that. It's too much of a demand on their emotional strength and their intellectual
[1:27:51.760 --> 1:28:00.320]  strength. And so it's something that people want to keep under the covers. Now, I think the reason
[1:28:00.320 --> 1:28:06.240]  the lie got started was that, you know, the Washington Post was doing a job on Nixon with
[1:28:06.240 --> 1:28:12.960]  Watergate. He was trying to wind down the war while Watergate was devouring him. And so he just
[1:28:12.960 --> 1:28:19.280]  didn't have any clout. He couldn't deliver the money to get the prisoners back. And so he had
[1:28:19.280 --> 1:28:24.000]  to say we had them all back, that the war's over and we have everybody back. He couldn't say,
[1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:31.040]  hey, the war's over and we've left all these people because he would be blamed, not the Washington
[1:28:31.040 --> 1:28:37.440]  Post, not those two reporters, Bernstein and Woodward, not the Congress. He would be blamed,
[1:28:37.440 --> 1:28:44.720]  and he was already in terrible hot water about Watergate. So he said, we have everybody back.
[1:28:44.720 --> 1:28:50.880]  Well, once the lie is in place, how do you get the lie out of place? Because by now, everyone's
[1:28:50.880 --> 1:28:55.440]  committed to it. The Congress is committed to it. The media is committed to it. Everyone
[1:28:55.440 --> 1:29:01.520]  is committed to the lie. It's just like 9-11. Look how much evidence has come out after the
[1:29:03.360 --> 1:29:08.640]  9-11 commission report, which proves that the whole thing was totally different.
[1:29:08.640 --> 1:29:13.280]  You've just hit on the key there. I just had another epiphany. That's right. They have a mass
[1:29:13.280 --> 1:29:18.080]  hoax. They tell you what the story is, and then everyone commits. And the average American says,
[1:29:18.080 --> 1:29:22.160]  I'm not going to believe I'm being lied to because if this is a lie, everything's a lie.
[1:29:22.160 --> 1:29:28.400]  And once they've got you, I guess by degrees, you become part of the evil. And now we're just a
[1:29:28.400 --> 1:29:33.520]  huge culture of lies. Dr. Roberts' long segment coming up, this was a short segment, continue
[1:29:33.520 --> 1:29:39.360]  breaking down this central point that you just made. It's like getting your arm caught in a
[1:29:39.360 --> 1:29:45.200]  sausage machine. It's just sucking us all in. And now we have to go along with every lie because
[1:29:45.200 --> 1:29:50.320]  our government isn't bad. They're good. And that allows the evil to grow. We're on the march.

[1:32:56.880 --> 1:33:08.800]  Okay, we're going back to Dr. Paul Craig Roberts and while we're on the subject of
[1:33:09.520 --> 1:33:13.520]  almost everything the government and the big corporations that control it says is a lie,
[1:33:14.240 --> 1:33:19.200]  until we're just swimming in an ether of lies and then anyone who discovers we're being lied to
[1:33:20.000 --> 1:33:26.240]  from the source documents from the witnesses is called a conspiracy theorist. I want to bring up
[1:33:26.240 --> 1:33:31.760]  the fact the Washington Post three days ago just came out in a headline about Saddam in a fake movie
[1:33:31.760 --> 1:33:38.240]  saying he was gay by the CIA that they did make a video, a fake bin Laden video. What an incredible
[1:33:38.240 --> 1:33:42.400]  admission or now they're suddenly everywhere admitting, okay, the troops help grow the opium
[1:33:42.400 --> 1:33:48.320]  because if we don't grow it, Al Qaeda will get it. So now they're just spinning everything but
[1:33:48.320 --> 1:33:53.200]  admitting everything. So we'll talk to him about that, the economy and a lot more, but I'm really
[1:33:53.200 --> 1:34:01.440]  glad he's out there promoting the fact that this huge cover up of the Pulitzer Prize winning report
[1:34:02.160 --> 1:34:06.800]  by a New York Times editor with all of the absolute proof, you got to go read the reports
[1:34:07.760 --> 1:34:13.200]  of the fact that they, I mean this is total proof, the government knowingly blocked it,
[1:34:13.200 --> 1:34:18.960]  knowingly shut it down, knowingly kept the public from knowing. I mean this is confirmed just like
[1:34:18.960 --> 1:34:24.800]  Gulf of Tonkin or so many other things, Operation Ajax, you name it. Before we go back to Dr.
[1:34:24.800 --> 1:34:30.320]  Roberts, now here's a book, The Secret Team. This is the book the CIA doesn't want you to read by
[1:34:30.320 --> 1:34:37.520]  L. Fletcher Proudy, Colonel U.S. Army. He was the admitted Pentagon liaison to the CIA and the
[1:34:37.520 --> 1:34:42.880]  White House briefer. We got a White House briefer, very important position, Ray McGovern joining us
[1:34:42.880 --> 1:34:49.360]  next hour. The Secret Team, this is now back in print from Skyhorse Publishing, available at
[1:34:49.360 --> 1:34:55.120]  infowars.com or Invisible Empire, a new order to find who these people are, how these criminal
[1:34:55.120 --> 1:35:00.320]  networks operate, how to stop them, very important new film. Police state for the rise of FEMA,
[1:35:00.320 --> 1:35:04.160]  the physical enforcement grid being put in because they know you're waking up,
[1:35:04.160 --> 1:35:08.000]  very important info, every American needs to see this. Don't tread on me,
[1:35:08.000 --> 1:35:13.040]  states rights, Ninth Amendment rights, one key avenue to take the country back, available at
[1:35:13.040 --> 1:35:21.280]  infowars.com and of course the Obama deception, all the republic, all of those available at infowars.com
[1:35:21.280 --> 1:35:28.560]  and you can also watch them all online at prisonplanet.tv. Okay, speaking of material,
[1:35:28.560 --> 1:35:32.320]  you may be fully awake audience, your friends, your family, your neighbors aren't. They know
[1:35:32.320 --> 1:35:38.160]  we're in trouble, now the time is ripe to educate people. Before we get back into this story, Dr. Roberts,
[1:35:38.160 --> 1:35:42.000]  tell folks about your new book because that is extremely informative.
[1:35:43.040 --> 1:35:51.040]  Well, that's how the economy was lost. That book explains how the elite destroyed the middle class
[1:35:51.040 --> 1:35:58.640]  jobs in order to further enrich themselves and how they have dismantled the ladders of
[1:35:58.640 --> 1:36:08.400]  upward mobility, stopping the ability of people to rise in order to put themselves in permanent
[1:36:08.400 --> 1:36:16.960]  control at the top and the other 99% of the population in poverty at the bottom. That's what
[1:36:16.960 --> 1:36:26.240]  the book shows. It shows how the end of the American middle class and the end of an opportunity
[1:36:26.240 --> 1:36:32.480]  for society. Now, Alex, let's get back to the story because, you know, one of the things
[1:36:33.280 --> 1:36:40.960]  that people always say when they are confronted with evidence that the government has lied or
[1:36:40.960 --> 1:36:45.840]  something, they would say, well, if there had been a real conspiracy, somebody would have talked.
[1:36:47.360 --> 1:36:54.080]  But of course, they always do talk. As I said earlier, two United States Secretaries of Defense
[1:36:54.080 --> 1:37:01.200]  talked and said in sworn testimony that people were left behind. Reagan's National Security
[1:37:01.200 --> 1:37:11.280]  Advisor talked. A leader of a Delta team, which twice was organized to go rescue the prisoners,
[1:37:11.280 --> 1:37:17.520]  only to be called off both times, has talked. All sorts of people have talked. So it doesn't do
[1:37:17.520 --> 1:37:24.080]  any good to talk. In the case of 9-11, we know and have said so many times, there were over 100
[1:37:24.080 --> 1:37:32.240]  first responders who were in the towers, firemen, policemen, building maintenance people who not
[1:37:32.240 --> 1:37:38.640]  only heard, but experienced explosions. They saw many floors underground in sub basements.
[1:37:38.640 --> 1:37:43.760]  Well, Doc, as you say, I've interviewed police and firemen who we saw on the CNN videos saying
[1:37:43.760 --> 1:37:47.920]  they're going to blow it up, get it back. They weren't involved. They were just told get back.
[1:37:47.920 --> 1:37:51.920]  And Silverstein says we gave the order to pull it and watch it come down. And now a Fox News
[1:37:51.920 --> 1:37:56.720]  pundit last month came out and said, yeah, I was there. We were talking about blowing it up with
[1:37:56.720 --> 1:38:02.240]  Silverstein, but we decided not to because it fell on its own. I mean, this is hidden in plain view.
[1:38:02.240 --> 1:38:05.840]  They're just counting on us to not be able to handle the full horror.
[1:38:05.840 --> 1:38:13.520]  Well, the point is it doesn't do any good to somebody talks because it remains a conspiracy
[1:38:14.160 --> 1:38:20.800]  theory. Now, as for the cover up, you know, obviously the Pentagon and the military are very
[1:38:20.800 --> 1:38:26.960]  interested in the cover up because how many people would join up the military if they expected to
[1:38:26.960 --> 1:38:31.200]  have to fight if they knew the government would abandon them if they were captured?
[1:38:31.200 --> 1:38:39.760]  I mean, what kind of morale would the army have in the Marines, for example, in the special forces?
[1:38:39.760 --> 1:38:45.600]  Would they be all these gung-ho people out there? If they were aware of the fact that if they get
[1:38:45.600 --> 1:38:51.760]  captured, they may simply be abandoned. And that when the war is over, they won't be repatriated.
[1:38:51.760 --> 1:38:58.320]  They'll just be left in the enemy's hands. So this is the reason for the cover up you see is
[1:38:58.320 --> 1:39:07.440]  there are many reasons affecting all parties. And what is also amazing is that the two chief
[1:39:09.040 --> 1:39:13.360]  celebrities who were prisoners of war, John McCain and John Kerry.
[1:39:14.960 --> 1:39:20.320]  Well, Kerry wasn't a prisoner of war, but he was controversial about the Vietnam
[1:39:20.320 --> 1:39:25.440]  getting the silver star. So we have these two and they're both instrumental in the cover up.
[1:39:25.440 --> 1:39:34.000]  Both of them have done everything possible to prevent the truth from coming out. And not only
[1:39:34.000 --> 1:39:42.480]  that, but to lock up all the documents that reveal the truth. So and McCain, of course,
[1:39:42.480 --> 1:39:52.400]  is notorious for brow beating all the witnesses, including the POW families. And Kerry went along
[1:39:52.400 --> 1:39:59.760]  with changes in the law that simply put locked away somewhere forever. All the documents that
[1:39:59.760 --> 1:40:07.120]  prove the prisoners were abandoned. So you can see the extent of the corruption in the evil.
[1:40:07.120 --> 1:40:14.560]  This John McCain on the right is John Kerry on the left. It's the Republicans. It's the Democrats.
[1:40:14.560 --> 1:40:22.080]  It's all the presidential appointees with the exception of those two secretaries of defense.
[1:40:22.080 --> 1:40:28.720]  And Reagan's national security advisor. Doc is somebody approaching with a vacuum cleaner?
[1:40:29.520 --> 1:40:35.120]  No. Okay, because there's a little bit of a hum in the background and it's just increased a little
[1:40:35.120 --> 1:40:38.880]  bit. I don't want it to, some of it was grounding you out, but that's important info you're covering.
[1:40:39.440 --> 1:40:45.840]  So we see the method of the control. In fact, from some of the documents I've seen in research,
[1:40:45.840 --> 1:40:52.960]  this is a system of corruption. They like to get the entire government, different power structures,
[1:40:52.960 --> 1:40:58.160]  involve the huge cover up because then later it can also be used to blackmail.
[1:40:58.160 --> 1:41:02.800]  And that's what special forces commanders and many others that we've talked to who've worked on this
[1:41:02.800 --> 1:41:10.640]  have said is that the North Vietnamese are blackmailing the federal government to this day
[1:41:10.640 --> 1:41:17.040]  because the federal government made that move to not get our troops out because they decided,
[1:41:17.040 --> 1:41:21.600]  okay, we'll pull out of there. We're done. We don't want the North, you know, who's taken over the
[1:41:21.600 --> 1:41:26.320]  South to be able to use this as a blue chip against us. We'll just call these troops expendable
[1:41:26.320 --> 1:41:31.760]  hardware and the communists are sitting there going, well, this is perfect. We'll keep them.
[1:41:31.760 --> 1:41:36.080]  And then they'll go along with the cover up. And then we've always got this ace in the hole.
[1:41:36.080 --> 1:41:43.760]  Exactly. That's right. And anybody in the American government that talks is simply out
[1:41:43.760 --> 1:41:50.960]  of the government. They go from being a high official to a nobody. So this is how the government
[1:41:50.960 --> 1:41:56.160]  gets away the slides. And of course, the American people or so many of them are just gullible.
[1:41:57.200 --> 1:42:04.080]  They're just terribly gullible. And they have this sort of faith and trust in government
[1:42:04.080 --> 1:42:08.800]  that Americans didn't used to have. I've blamed that on Franklin Roosevelt, who,
[1:42:10.240 --> 1:42:16.800]  in the Great Depression, trying to rally people. They gave them the idea which they've had ever
[1:42:16.800 --> 1:42:21.440]  since that the government is their protector. And it's going to put a chicken in every pot.
[1:42:22.800 --> 1:42:28.720]  And keep them safe, you see. And as we've talked about many times on your program,
[1:42:28.720 --> 1:42:35.040]  and this was the line of the Bush Cheney regime, that, oh, we're going to take away all your
[1:42:35.040 --> 1:42:39.680]  civil liberties and destroy the Constitution in order to make you safe from terrorists.
[1:42:40.800 --> 1:42:48.720]  And people just are gullible and they fall for it. And so it's not really hard for government to
[1:42:48.720 --> 1:42:55.840]  pull off things like 9-11. Because all it has to do is give some kind of explanation and people
[1:42:55.840 --> 1:43:02.560]  believe it. They don't say, hey, the government did this. That's not their first thought. It never
[1:43:02.560 --> 1:43:13.360]  enters ahead. It's always, oh, some tiny group of Muslims who can't even fly airplanes. They did.
[1:43:17.040 --> 1:43:24.240]  But perhaps, to repeat myself, the fact that this story is now getting out and getting some
[1:43:24.240 --> 1:43:30.320]  attention about the POWs, because that really touches at the heart of American patriotism,
[1:43:30.320 --> 1:43:35.840]  doesn't it? I mean, that really touches the flag waivers, the people who want to kill them
[1:43:35.840 --> 1:43:44.080]  over there before they come over here. It really cuts to the very heart of the most conservative
[1:43:44.080 --> 1:43:49.680]  people, the people who are most willing to go to war to achieve whatever the government says.
[1:43:49.680 --> 1:43:56.320]  If it turns out that the government has actually abandoned its own soldiers, then it could possibly
[1:43:56.320 --> 1:44:04.720]  shake some of those people. It could possibly cause more skepticism among the public and it
[1:44:04.720 --> 1:44:13.040]  could lead to the unraveling of other massive lies and conspiracies. Well, Dr. Paul Roberts,
[1:44:13.040 --> 1:44:20.160]  let me expand on that because from my research, and I mean, it's on record this happened, there was
[1:44:20.160 --> 1:44:29.200]  over 20,000 U.S. troops in German POW camps that were grabbed by the Russians. And by then,
[1:44:29.840 --> 1:44:37.280]  Roosevelt had died, and Harry Truman said, Stalin's our ally, and basically, we're not
[1:44:37.280 --> 1:44:41.440]  going to get in a fight with him. They gave him half of Eastern Europe. They gave him half of Germany.
[1:44:41.440 --> 1:44:49.120]  That's the thing that made, and now documents have come out on this. That's what caused Patton
[1:44:49.120 --> 1:44:59.120]  to have a complete conniption fit, and so they killed him. And so this has been a policy for a
[1:44:59.120 --> 1:45:05.920]  while that troops are just expendable animals, as Henry Kissinger said. And so this goes back
[1:45:05.920 --> 1:45:10.960]  even to the greatest generation, and I would challenge all these Pulitzer Prize-winning people
[1:45:10.960 --> 1:45:13.360]  to go look into that because that's hidden in plain view as well.
[1:45:14.960 --> 1:45:21.520]  Yes, I think you're right. The people, you know, Frederick von Hayek in his book, The Road to
[1:45:21.520 --> 1:45:29.120]  Serpentine, he has a chapter of why the worst always get on top. And that goes not just for
[1:45:30.320 --> 1:45:37.520]  totalitarian systems, but for democracies. The worst rise to the top. And we certainly have the
[1:45:37.520 --> 1:45:43.920]  worst people in the country in Washington. That's where the worst people are. And these
[1:45:43.920 --> 1:45:53.520]  kinds of people don't have compunction. They don't have shame. They're not moral. They have
[1:45:53.520 --> 1:46:03.360]  ruthless agendas that feature themselves. And that is why democracy itself is no protection
[1:46:03.360 --> 1:46:07.520]  from a ruthless government. Well, that's why you've got to have the Republic,
[1:46:07.520 --> 1:46:11.040]  where the minority as well as the majority is protected. And I've done a general research
[1:46:11.040 --> 1:46:14.720]  of history. I don't claim to be a historian, but I read history books almost every day.
[1:46:15.360 --> 1:46:20.400]  As my entertainment, that's how I actually got informed as an adolescent and a teenager was
[1:46:20.400 --> 1:46:24.720]  because I happened to pick up history as a form of entertainment and not knowing I was educating
[1:46:24.720 --> 1:46:29.440]  myself on the way the world works, but really studying our founding fathers. They weren't
[1:46:29.440 --> 1:46:35.600]  perfect, but there was Western expansion. They wanted to be left alone by the bigger mafia,
[1:46:35.600 --> 1:46:42.240]  the crown, to build their own little systems. And so they created a system to restrain the
[1:46:42.240 --> 1:46:49.200]  avarice of king rats, of the strong men. And that's why this country produced half the world's wealth,
[1:46:49.200 --> 1:46:54.720]  only 4% of the population. So one of the few times in history, the flower of the Renaissance,
[1:46:54.720 --> 1:46:59.600]  and now watching that being drugged down and being used as the engine of world tyranny,
[1:47:01.280 --> 1:47:04.880]  it's very frustrating. Yes, it is very frustrating.
[1:47:07.200 --> 1:47:14.320]  But if we can just keep making people aware that every American government since Nixon
[1:47:15.200 --> 1:47:22.240]  has covered up the abandonment of American prisons of war. And, you know, we have this
[1:47:22.240 --> 1:47:28.880]  definitely proved in the case of Vietnam and may well be proved in the case of the World War II
[1:47:28.880 --> 1:47:39.360]  prisons. This should help bring the sort of most gullible flag waving patrons to some
[1:47:39.360 --> 1:47:44.640]  realization that the government isn't trustworthy and that doesn't look after anyone's interest,
[1:47:44.640 --> 1:47:51.360]  not even the soldiers that are out there giving up their lives and limbs.
[1:47:51.360 --> 1:47:55.440]  Well, what about this issue? They asked the troops to torture. They asked them to execute
[1:47:55.440 --> 1:48:00.080]  people in Afghanistan illegally, which then corrupts them. And then every time it comes out,
[1:48:00.080 --> 1:48:06.240]  like Abu Ghraib in Iraq, they then prosecute the people who on record were following the
[1:48:06.240 --> 1:48:11.280]  White House memos and orders. So it's not just that you'll be left behind. It's that you'll be
[1:48:11.280 --> 1:48:17.040]  used up and then scapegoated later because there's no honor among these thieves that run the system.
[1:48:17.040 --> 1:48:23.680]  That's exactly right. I don't know why anyone who was aware would have anything to do with the
[1:48:23.680 --> 1:48:32.080]  military. I don't know why anyone would join. I can't understand why the students at West Point
[1:48:32.080 --> 1:48:37.360]  and Annapolis and the Air Force Academy just don't get up en masse and walk out
[1:48:37.360 --> 1:48:46.400]  because they're going to be betrayed, too, or they're going to be used for evil and then betrayed.
[1:48:48.800 --> 1:48:54.560]  And even if you don't want to be, you're forced to go along with it or your career is destroyed.
[1:48:54.560 --> 1:48:59.760]  But that's my point. There's a systematic evil throughout history. We see Hitler killing his
[1:48:59.760 --> 1:49:03.360]  brown shirts that brought him to power. We see things that happen in every society.
[1:49:03.360 --> 1:49:11.920]  It's like a tropism. It's a pathology in corrupt elites that their greatest
[1:49:11.920 --> 1:49:18.320]  glee is hanging their own attack dogs out to dry. Because if I was one of these evil people,
[1:49:18.320 --> 1:49:22.640]  but I guess I'm not evil, so I can't understand it, I would at least defend my henchmen and my
[1:49:22.640 --> 1:49:29.120]  servants to have that servant group, my praetorian, but no, they treat their praetorian like toilet
[1:49:29.120 --> 1:49:35.840]  paper. That's right, because they learn from the Romans that the praetorian can take over the rule.
[1:49:37.040 --> 1:49:43.440]  So Stalin ends up killing his own heads of his secret police and his own colleagues in the
[1:49:43.440 --> 1:49:52.000]  Politburo because they become, they know that no one has any, any integrity or morality and that
[1:49:52.000 --> 1:49:58.720]  they're all a fair game for one another. So whoever strikes first and gets rid of the others is
[1:49:58.720 --> 1:50:07.600]  the survivor. And that's how the system ends up eating it, eating itself. But of course what we,
[1:50:07.600 --> 1:50:12.640]  we don't really care if the evil people eat each other up. What we're worried about is that how
[1:50:12.640 --> 1:50:21.120]  they're destroying the rest of us who are not among their ranks. And this is the fact that the
[1:50:21.120 --> 1:50:26.880]  American people need to wake up to, and you keep telling them about every day. Well, that's another
[1:50:26.880 --> 1:50:30.400]  issue. I mean, I've seen your transformation and research the last five, six years, we've been
[1:50:30.400 --> 1:50:34.160]  talking to you from saying they're just a bunch of nuts, a bunch of croaks, they don't know what
[1:50:34.160 --> 1:50:38.880]  they're doing, just saying, no, this is clearly by design, because all the evidence shows it is.
[1:50:38.880 --> 1:50:44.560]  I want to briefly talk about the economy with you and all these headlines. Is Europe heading for a
[1:50:44.560 --> 1:50:51.040]  meltdown? You know, just, just, just on and on and on what's happening worldwide, where this
[1:50:51.040 --> 1:50:58.000]  agenda is going, and also about them just openly announcing that they make fake bin Laden videos.

[1:51:58.720 --> 1:52:03.440]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in
[1:52:03.440 --> 1:52:08.080]  secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid
[1:52:08.080 --> 1:52:12.160]  seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true, seeds about performing even
[1:52:12.160 --> 1:52:16.640]  golden silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again. So our
[1:52:16.640 --> 1:52:21.440]  friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.

[1:54:02.240 --> 1:54:05.760]  All right, with us until five after the first little segment of the next hour is Dr. Paul
[1:54:05.760 --> 1:54:12.640]  Craig Roberts, then high-level CIA analyst, the man who briefed Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush
[1:54:12.640 --> 1:54:19.760]  every morning, key, quote, CIA White House focal officer. That's what Fletcher Prouty did between
[1:54:19.760 --> 1:54:26.080]  the Pentagon and the CIA, key person on what's happening in North Korea and Iran, joining us
[1:54:26.080 --> 1:54:32.240]  for the last 52 minutes of the next hour. Doc, for people watching on PrisonPlanet.tv,
[1:54:32.240 --> 1:54:36.240]  I'm going to give them a document cam shot of this. For radio listeners, the headline is,
[1:54:36.240 --> 1:54:42.640]  CIA unit's wacky idea depicts Saddam Hussein as gay, and it's spy talk Jeff Stein, you know,
[1:54:42.640 --> 1:54:50.560]  little propagandist. But in the seventh paragraph, they just let it slip out. The agency actually
[1:54:50.560 --> 1:54:55.920]  did make a video purporting to show Osama bin Laden and his cronies sitting around a campfire
[1:54:55.920 --> 1:55:01.920]  swinging bottles of liquor and savoring their conquest with boys. One of the former CIA officers
[1:55:01.920 --> 1:55:08.160]  recalled chuckling at the memory. The actors were drawn from some of the darker skinned employees,
[1:55:08.160 --> 1:55:12.880]  he said. Now, I asked Dr. Roberts during the break, I mean, I knew the answer, but I wanted to get
[1:55:12.880 --> 1:55:17.200]  his take just to see if he concurred. Why are they doing this, Doc? Why are they admitting
[1:55:17.200 --> 1:55:22.480]  they're growing OPM in Afghanistan and have our troops on TV saying they do it? Why are they
[1:55:22.480 --> 1:55:26.320]  admitting, you know, saying that they killed the same al-Qaeda leader 14, 15 times,
[1:55:26.320 --> 1:55:30.400]  never retract the last time they killed him? Why are they now just admitting the bin Laden
[1:55:30.400 --> 1:55:36.560]  tapes are fake? And he gave the answer that I agree with. Dr. Roberts, tell folks why.
[1:55:36.560 --> 1:55:43.040]  Well, I think Alex, what they're doing, they're showing us that they're, that they have immunity,
[1:55:44.560 --> 1:55:49.360]  that they can do whatever they want, and they can do it openly, and they can lie to us openly,
[1:55:50.080 --> 1:55:56.880]  and they can tell us that they commit crimes, and yet they don't suffer any consequences.
[1:55:56.880 --> 1:56:03.120]  I think they're getting us accustomed and used to the fact that they can do whatever they want
[1:56:03.120 --> 1:56:12.960]  and even admit it, and that we just have to sort of not notice and accept the fact that
[1:56:12.960 --> 1:56:19.440]  they are unaccountable and can do whatever they want. So, you know, it just makes you accept
[1:56:20.640 --> 1:56:25.280]  the culture of lies, and it makes the people realize that they're powerless.
[1:56:26.320 --> 1:56:32.240]  Here's the government that lies to us, and then admits it lies to us, and then goes on and lies
[1:56:32.240 --> 1:56:37.840]  to us some more, and admits it some more, and it's just kind of a way of showing the people
[1:56:37.840 --> 1:56:42.800]  that they don't count. I'll expand on that, though. There was a city employee, John Villarreal,
[1:56:42.800 --> 1:56:47.840]  who went to Huntsville for three years, and I confirmed his city employee was stealing money
[1:56:47.840 --> 1:56:52.640]  and trying to shut down Access TV four years ago, five years ago now. So, I secretly recorded him,
[1:56:52.640 --> 1:56:57.120]  put private investigators on him, because that's where I started out. I wasn't doing a show there
[1:56:57.120 --> 1:57:02.320]  anymore, but I wanted to keep it alive, and he came to me, and I didn't have a camera rolling.
[1:57:02.320 --> 1:57:06.080]  I was coming out of the bathroom at the telecommunications commission downtown.
[1:57:06.080 --> 1:57:10.400]  He was waiting for me in the hall, and I had my camera guy inside for the commission,
[1:57:10.400 --> 1:57:15.360]  and he walked over, and he shoved me in the chest, and he said, you bet I stole the money,
[1:57:15.360 --> 1:57:19.600]  and I'm going to kill you, and you're never going to stop me. And I said, that's a threat.
[1:57:19.600 --> 1:57:24.400]  I'm going to send your ass to prison. Excuse my French, folks. And I did send him to prison.
[1:57:24.400 --> 1:57:29.040]  So, it's also kind of a bravado they do, like, yeah, we made the fake tapes,
[1:57:29.040 --> 1:57:34.800]  yeah, you know, we did it all, so what? And so, I don't think they're invincible, and there is
[1:57:34.800 --> 1:57:38.880]  a wake-up call happening, but I'm afraid they're going to start wars, Dr. Roberts,
[1:57:38.880 --> 1:57:44.480]  as the smoke screen for what they're doing. Well, I'm certainly going to start more wars.
[1:57:44.480 --> 1:57:51.520]  There's no doubt about that. It's just hope they don't get a nuclear war going with Russia.
[1:57:51.520 --> 1:57:55.840]  Well, we know Cheney now, it's come out, really did want to start a war with him,
[1:57:55.840 --> 1:58:01.200]  and his whole 888 thing. Well, that's been the whole neocon line for years.
[1:58:02.480 --> 1:58:07.600]  They wanted a nuclear war with Russia. That's part of the bravado, yeah.
[1:58:09.040 --> 1:58:12.000]  Well, let's talk briefly about the counter. Yeah, let's do that. One minute break,
[1:58:12.000 --> 1:58:15.200]  we're going to come back for five minutes with you, but we're here laughing about it.
[1:58:15.200 --> 1:58:22.240]  It's gallows humor, because they just, it's tough, you know, we want nuclear war, it's fun,
[1:58:22.960 --> 1:58:27.280]  because they've got all the women, all the whores, all the money. These guys are like Hitler,
[1:58:27.280 --> 1:58:31.920]  who would sit there watching Warsaw burn, you know, he would get up on the front line and watch from
[1:58:31.920 --> 1:58:37.520]  five miles away, just because he liked watching buildings burn. He liked watching Stukas drop bombs.

[1:58:48.400 --> 1:58:53.360]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[1:58:53.360 --> 1:58:56.800]  What have we got? A republic or a monarchy?
[1:58:56.800 --> 1:59:00.480]  A republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[1:59:00.480 --> 1:59:04.720]  Not democracy, not mob rule, two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[1:59:04.720 --> 1:59:09.440]  So they think they own our land, they think they're on our water, children, our education,
[1:59:09.440 --> 1:59:14.320]  our money. We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[1:59:14.320 --> 1:59:18.000]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the patriot uprising.
[1:59:18.000 --> 1:59:22.160]  You have been warned. We have the facts, we have the constitution, we have the bill of
[1:59:22.160 --> 1:59:26.800]  rights, we have common law. Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm so excited to be
[1:59:26.800 --> 1:59:31.600]  able to offer you, don't tread on me, rise of the republic, tyranny is upon us, but liberty
[1:59:31.600 --> 1:59:36.160]  and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising. A new tool in the info war.
[1:59:36.160 --> 1:59:44.960]  Don't tread on me. Order it at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139

[2:00:18.160 --> 2:00:22.720]  Okay, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts is our guest, best-selling author, syndicated columnist,
[2:00:23.520 --> 2:00:29.600]  father of ergonomics. We got about four and a half minutes. The economy, the meltdown accelerating
[2:00:31.360 --> 2:00:36.560]  the Goldman Sachs emails where they knew that the economy was going to implode,
[2:00:36.560 --> 2:00:41.520]  they set up the derivative scam, we have them red-handed. Sir, where is this going?
[2:00:41.520 --> 2:00:49.920]  Well, Alex, I think what we have is another criminal elite in charge of the financial sector,
[2:00:49.920 --> 2:00:55.040]  they in charge of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and of course the New York Investment
[2:00:55.040 --> 2:01:00.240]  Banks and the hedge funds. Now, think about this for a minute. Allegedly, the euro is collapsing
[2:01:00.240 --> 2:01:05.280]  because of the Greek debt. Now, that makes no sense whatsoever. Greece is a small country,
[2:01:05.280 --> 2:01:12.800]  its debts could not possibly be a threat to the euro. But we hear about this constantly,
[2:01:12.800 --> 2:01:17.360]  over and over and over and over, and so it's propaganda coming out of the hedge funds. They're
[2:01:17.360 --> 2:01:21.680]  making a killing on it. If you can make the world think the euro is going to collapse,
[2:01:21.680 --> 2:01:29.520]  you can make all kind of money shorting the euro. And it's the same crowd of crooks that sold the
[2:01:29.520 --> 2:01:39.040]  derivatives and that sold junk with AAA investment ratings on it. And so that's what they're now
[2:01:39.040 --> 2:01:46.240]  doing. This whole thing about the euro is a scam run by the hedge funds and they're getting rich
[2:01:46.240 --> 2:01:52.800]  off of it. Look, the most indebted country in the world is Japan. The second most indebted country
[2:01:52.800 --> 2:02:04.160]  is the United States. They're far worse conditions than Europe. And yet, it's Europe that's in the
[2:02:04.160 --> 2:02:10.240]  news and the euro is collapsing against the dollar. Why should anything collapse against the dollar,
[2:02:10.240 --> 2:02:17.040]  the dollar? This has massive trade deficit, massive budget deficits. They're unclosable.
[2:02:17.040 --> 2:02:25.040]  The government is indebted up to over its head. The population is indebted. It's a far worse
[2:02:25.040 --> 2:02:30.160]  situation than in Europe and yet, it's the euro. So what it really is, it's a play of the New
[2:02:30.160 --> 2:02:36.480]  York investment banks and the hedge funds against the euro. And they're getting rich off of it,
[2:02:36.480 --> 2:02:42.080]  just like they got rich off of derivatives. Yeah, they looted us two years ago and now they're looting
[2:02:42.080 --> 2:02:47.120]  Europe and they're just like a group of carrion crows that fly around eating the flesh off our
[2:02:47.120 --> 2:02:56.160]  bones. And the media doesn't ever explain it. They just provide the free propaganda that keeps
[2:02:56.160 --> 2:03:02.000]  the money running into the hedge funds and the New York investment banks. Last night, I was reading
[2:03:02.000 --> 2:03:14.640]  a manual of British Naval War College documents on pirate accounts from the 1617-1800s. And the way
[2:03:14.640 --> 2:03:19.280]  this elite behaves is kind of like pirates where they just wildly wouldn't even pull the corks off
[2:03:19.280 --> 2:03:26.640]  whiskey bottles. They would just hack the tops off and just drink it down. So there's a method of
[2:03:26.640 --> 2:03:30.800]  the madness, doctor. But overall, do you agree that they're just complete out of control lunatics?
[2:03:30.800 --> 2:03:35.120]  Yes. And in fact, I would even say pirates had more honor.
[2:03:37.920 --> 2:03:45.920]  So they're worse than pirates. And nothing is being done about it. You notice the regulation
[2:03:46.640 --> 2:03:53.360]  of the financial system, nothing happens. Or it's all watered down or it's turned into something
[2:03:53.360 --> 2:03:58.080]  that enables them to plunder more. Yeah, now they're going to take over all the little banks
[2:03:58.080 --> 2:04:05.600]  and track every purchase we make. That's right. You'll see massive financial concentration,
[2:04:06.160 --> 2:04:11.200]  which is probably another reason for all this trouble. That's probably what they're trying to do
[2:04:11.920 --> 2:04:18.320]  is to get rid of the large number of banks. So there's just a few large ones. It's the same
[2:04:18.320 --> 2:04:26.880]  thing they did to the media when they concentrated it in the hands of a few job firms. But nobody
[2:04:26.880 --> 2:04:32.160]  is going to tell the people the Congress isn't going to hold those kinds of hearings and the
[2:04:32.160 --> 2:04:38.480]  press is not going to do any investigation. Well, Doc, good job on reporting on the huge
[2:04:38.480 --> 2:04:43.360]  breaking news of the POW cover up completely confirmed by Pulitzer Prize winning journalist.
[2:04:43.360 --> 2:04:46.160]  We'll talk to you again soon, Lord willing. Thanks for spending time with us.
[2:04:46.880 --> 2:04:50.800]  Glad to be with you, Alex. It's always informative. Dr. Paul Craig Roberts,
[2:04:50.800 --> 2:04:58.400]  Ryan McGovern coming up. We'll be right back. Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the
[2:04:58.400 --> 2:05:03.200]  global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[2:05:03.200 --> 2:05:07.600]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or
[2:05:07.600 --> 2:05:11.840]  gold? It's true. Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's
[2:05:11.840 --> 2:05:16.640]  possible that could even happen again. So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together
[2:05:16.640 --> 2:05:23.040]  the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds. They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless
[2:05:23.040 --> 2:05:27.760]  supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family. And here's the best part. These seeds
[2:05:27.760 --> 2:05:32.560]  have not been genetically modified in any way. And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full
[2:05:32.560 --> 2:05:39.280]  acre crisis garden. So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com
[2:05:39.280 --> 2:05:50.400]  or give them a call at 877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis,
[2:05:50.400 --> 2:05:55.520]  non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[2:05:56.640 --> 2:06:01.360]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle and
[2:06:01.360 --> 2:06:06.080]  they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be
[2:06:06.080 --> 2:06:12.080]  all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones. Food is your only ammunition.
[2:06:12.080 --> 2:06:17.360]  How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts. When will you need it?
[2:06:17.360 --> 2:06:22.000]  Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children
[2:06:22.000 --> 2:06:26.560]  sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[2:06:26.560 --> 2:06:32.000]  and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply. Food is your
[2:06:32.000 --> 2:06:37.200]  ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know.
[2:06:37.200 --> 2:06:42.240]  How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live to
[2:06:42.240 --> 2:06:51.200]  fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com. Again,
[2:06:51.200 --> 2:06:58.720]  that number, 1-800-409-5633. Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are
[2:06:58.720 --> 2:07:03.360]  now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that
[2:07:03.360 --> 2:07:08.160]  in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true,
[2:07:08.160 --> 2:07:11.840]  seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that
[2:07:11.840 --> 2:07:16.240]  could even happen again. So our friends at Solutions From Science have put together the
[2:07:16.240 --> 2:07:22.480]  perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds. They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless
[2:07:22.480 --> 2:07:27.360]  supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family. And here's the best part. These seeds have

[2:07:48.480 --> 2:07:53.520]  in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for
[2:07:53.520 --> 2:08:03.040]  survivalseedbank.com. He's the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:08:04.960 --> 2:08:10.000]  Okay, he joins us to talk about a host of issues. What's happening on the Korean Peninsula,
[2:08:10.000 --> 2:08:15.760]  which could lead to nuclear war. I mean, that's all over the headlines. Israel's saying they may go
[2:08:15.760 --> 2:08:20.880]  into Iran sooner rather than later. That's back on the front burner. You know, is there a Fox
[2:08:20.880 --> 2:08:28.320]  Fallon to stop it? What will Admiral Mullen do? You've got this global financial meltdown happening.
[2:08:28.320 --> 2:08:34.480]  You notice world wars always start during a major global meltdown. There's a method of this madness.
[2:08:34.480 --> 2:08:41.760]  I also want to ask you later about CIA units' wacky idea to pick Saddam as gay. That's not the
[2:08:41.760 --> 2:08:47.360]  issue. Buried in the Washington Post article, they quote the CIA officers as producing fake
[2:08:47.360 --> 2:08:52.880]  bin Laden videos. Now, people have looked at the video of the fat bin Laden admitted it's fake.
[2:08:52.880 --> 2:08:56.720]  They've had linguists listen to it. It's not him, not the dialect. They've done voice print.
[2:08:57.280 --> 2:09:01.520]  These tapes are basically all fake or old tapes of him re-edited. I want to ask
[2:09:01.520 --> 2:09:07.120]  Raymond Governe about that. We're going to get into suddenly New York Times, Washington Post,
[2:09:07.120 --> 2:09:12.320]  Wall Street Journal, Fox News, Geraldo Rivera with the Marine Corps commander. We're here helping
[2:09:12.320 --> 2:09:18.800]  the Afghans grow the opium. We have to or Al Qaeda will get the opium. I mean, folks, they're really
[2:09:18.800 --> 2:09:22.720]  coming out in the open. Yeah, we put out fake bin Laden days. Yeah, we're growing the smack.
[2:09:23.520 --> 2:09:29.360]  Yeah, yeah, we left the POWs. Pulitzer Prize winning reports now getting a lot of news on,
[2:09:30.560 --> 2:09:34.320]  you know, that front. So we'll talk about it all. Raymond Governe was in Vietnam, by the way.
[2:09:34.320 --> 2:09:38.000]  So we're going to cover it all in the next hour with him today.
[2:09:38.000 --> 2:09:45.200]  Raymond Governe is a activist who writes and lectures all over the country. He's co-founder
[2:09:45.200 --> 2:09:51.120]  of veterans intelligence professionals for sanity. And we really appreciate him joining us. He was
[2:09:51.120 --> 2:09:59.120]  one of the chief CIA briefers for Reagan and Bush senior. And that's a key position in a
[2:09:59.120 --> 2:10:05.200]  focal point position where you have Pentagon liaison to CIA. You have CIA liaison to White House.
[2:10:05.200 --> 2:10:11.280]  The these focal officers like Fletcher Prowdy and the secret team, again, have you have unique
[2:10:11.280 --> 2:10:17.680]  perspective on wide ranging analysis and how it ties in, not just specialist. So they can draw
[2:10:17.680 --> 2:10:21.520]  on all the specialists. And so that's why it's such an important lens to have them on with us.
[2:10:21.520 --> 2:10:24.880]  So I've thrown out there, sir, what I want to cover with you in the next 50 minutes.
[2:10:25.440 --> 2:10:30.640]  You've got the floor with what of that cornucopia that you think is most important in your breakdown
[2:10:30.640 --> 2:10:36.960]  on what we're facing. Thanks. First, just to make sure that the record is correct,
[2:10:36.960 --> 2:10:42.160]  I don't want to pull a boom and fall from Connecticut here. I didn't serve actually in
[2:10:42.160 --> 2:10:49.600]  Vietnam. I was an army infantry intelligence officer from 62 to 64 before Vietnam really
[2:10:49.600 --> 2:10:56.080]  started. And while it was going on, I was the principal analyst at CIA for Soviet policy
[2:10:56.080 --> 2:11:02.080]  toward Vietnam. So I learned quite a bit about it, but I never set foot in the country. With respect
[2:11:02.080 --> 2:11:09.200]  to what's going on here, the most important thing that's happening today is that David Obey,
[2:11:09.200 --> 2:11:16.720]  chair of appropriations in the House, is letting some lipstick go on the $33 billion
[2:11:17.680 --> 2:11:24.640]  appropriation for escalating war in Afghanistan. And that lipstick is $23 billion
[2:11:24.640 --> 2:11:33.920]  for teachers so that they don't lose their jobs. Obey knows better what he's done here is bowed
[2:11:33.920 --> 2:11:40.400]  to the Washington establishment that want to continue this war. It looks very much as though
[2:11:40.400 --> 2:11:46.720]  what he will report out of his committee this evening is a bill that includes $23 billion
[2:11:46.720 --> 2:11:55.680]  for teachers, keep schools going, and $33 billion for Afghanistan to keep that feckless war going
[2:11:55.680 --> 2:12:03.200]  and more and more people being killed. It's just really... I was a former admirer of David Obey
[2:12:03.200 --> 2:12:10.080]  and so I wrote him a memorandum that disappeared already on afterdowneastreet.com. I guess it's
[2:12:10.080 --> 2:12:18.400]  now called warisacrime.org. And you can see that he's being completely disingenuous because as
[2:12:18.400 --> 2:12:25.040]  recently as two months ago, he told a TV interviewer that this Afghanistan adventure,
[2:12:25.040 --> 2:12:31.680]  it's a fool's errand. But if we're going to do it, we have to pay for it. We have to fully fund it.
[2:12:32.240 --> 2:12:38.320]  Now, what kind of logic does that make, Alex? It's a fool's errand, but if we're going to do it,
[2:12:38.320 --> 2:12:42.320]  we've got to fund it. Well, Ray McGovern, let me throw this out at you and then you can expand
[2:12:42.320 --> 2:12:46.800]  on your concern of what's happening in Afghanistan, expanding into Pakistan. Sure. But in layman's
[2:12:46.800 --> 2:12:52.080]  terms, I'm somebody who sits there and studies it for years and so I want your perspective and
[2:12:52.080 --> 2:12:56.480]  correct me if I'm wrong. You've got all these pipelines going through there, trillions of the
[2:12:56.480 --> 2:13:02.240]  aggregate of oil, hundreds of billions in no-bid contract black holes. So the defense lobby
[2:13:02.240 --> 2:13:08.240]  likes it. The oil lobby likes it. Israel likes it because that gets the U.S. more firmly burrowed
[2:13:08.240 --> 2:13:14.320]  into the Middle East and Central Asia. So that lobby likes it. But more importantly, 500 billion a
[2:13:14.320 --> 2:13:21.840]  year, 91% now, it was a lot lower of the opium pouring out into Russia, into Asia, kind of a
[2:13:21.840 --> 2:13:28.080]  replay of the Boxer Rebellion, part two. And now our troops are admittedly over there protecting
[2:13:28.080 --> 2:13:33.440]  the poppy fields. And so I think you've got at least the contractors that's come now. That's what
[2:13:33.440 --> 2:13:39.600]  Sybil Edmond said pre-911, shipping the opium into Turkey, you name it. And so it's really about
[2:13:39.600 --> 2:13:44.720]  narcotics. And so people look at the policy and say, why are we there? Well, we're really there
[2:13:44.720 --> 2:13:51.200]  because black ops likes 500 billion dollars. Well, that's part of it, Alex, to be sure. The other
[2:13:51.200 --> 2:14:00.160]  part is a more kind of geopolitical adventure here. Imperialism is not dead. If you look at
[2:14:00.160 --> 2:14:06.400]  Afghanistan, you'll see that it's strategically located in the same neighborhood as China,
[2:14:06.400 --> 2:14:13.440]  as Iran, as through Russia, really, Turkey, Iraq. It's right there in the middle of things.
[2:14:13.440 --> 2:14:20.400]  And so the way the empire looks at things is, well, we got to be in their firstest with the
[2:14:20.400 --> 2:14:27.600]  mostest, even if it's mostly an attempt to deny the Chinese or the Russians or the Indians or
[2:14:27.600 --> 2:14:36.000]  whomever from getting in there before we were. Now, what makes Afghanistan strategic? Well,
[2:14:36.000 --> 2:14:41.120]  one of the things that makes it strategic is that it lies directly beneath a country called
[2:14:41.120 --> 2:14:46.960]  Turkmenistan, which used to be part of the Soviet Union. And Turkmenistan has in it
[2:14:48.000 --> 2:14:52.880]  natural gas deposits worth all the oil under the sands of Iraq.
[2:14:52.880 --> 2:14:59.360]  Now, the problem is Chevron's in there. A lot of the oil companies are in there,
[2:14:59.360 --> 2:15:06.240]  natural gas companies, but you can't get it here from there, okay? You've got to do a pipeline,
[2:15:06.240 --> 2:15:11.280]  and you can't have that pipeline go through Russia. You have to have it go south. And guess
[2:15:11.280 --> 2:15:17.360]  what the next country is, is Afghanistan and then Pakistan and then a little slice of India.
[2:15:17.360 --> 2:15:23.360]  And at the terminal of this projected pipeline, all the studies were done and was ready to go.
[2:15:23.360 --> 2:15:28.960]  Guess what? Enron was supposed to be the person marketing that natural gas. So the whole thing
[2:15:28.960 --> 2:15:36.400]  is as corrupt as can be. The Taliban visited Houston, Texas when Governor George Bush expressed
[2:15:36.400 --> 2:15:42.720]  interest in what was going on there with this pipeline, our ambassador to Afghanistan, and
[2:15:42.720 --> 2:15:48.880]  later to Iraq Khalidzad was one of the people involved in this, and so was Karzai.
[2:15:49.440 --> 2:15:51.280]  Yeah, he was the Unicol executive.
[2:15:51.280 --> 2:15:55.760]  Yeah. So that's part of it. Now, I'm not saying that the whole thing, the whole thing,
[2:15:55.760 --> 2:16:00.960]  the whole ball of wax involves this strategic location. And what needs to happen here, Alex,
[2:16:00.960 --> 2:16:08.080]  in my view, is pretty simple. There's a finite amount of oil. There's a finite amount of natural
[2:16:08.080 --> 2:16:14.640]  gas in this world. Now, if we're going to try to seize it all or seize control of it,
[2:16:15.600 --> 2:16:22.080]  then Iraq can be looked on as simply the first resource war of the 21st century.
[2:16:22.080 --> 2:16:28.240]  What we have to do is what my four-year-old grandson learns in nursery school. I went up
[2:16:28.240 --> 2:16:33.840]  and I asked his teacher, what do you expect to teach these kids? They said, oh, that's simple.
[2:16:33.840 --> 2:16:40.080]  We teach them that they have to learn to share a certain amount of toys on the table. They have to
[2:16:40.080 --> 2:16:45.520]  learn to share because there's a finite amount of things. And I said, wow, there it is. Cheney,
[2:16:45.520 --> 2:16:51.680]  Bush, even now Obama, they never went to this nursery school for sure. What has to happen
[2:16:51.680 --> 2:16:56.480]  is we get together with the Chinese, the Indians, and other people who need that oil and gas,
[2:16:57.200 --> 2:17:01.680]  figure out how to share it. And jointly develop it instead. I mean, we go back to 53.
[2:17:01.680 --> 2:17:07.600]  That's what caused the old Iran thing, as you know. Mohammed Mosadek said we're going to keep 25%
[2:17:07.600 --> 2:17:14.080]  of our own money to American oil companies and British oil companies. And they said, no, we get
[2:17:14.080 --> 2:17:19.600]  everything. We overthrow you using the Muslim extremist. I mean, it's the same story every time.
[2:17:19.600 --> 2:17:24.640]  That's right. Well, that was a company called BP, actually, which I think has been in the news
[2:17:24.640 --> 2:17:34.640]  lately. You get a corrupt enterprise like British Petroleum, which controlled all the oil in Iran
[2:17:34.640 --> 2:17:43.840]  prior to the revolution in 53. And if you let them persuade you to overthrow the governments there,
[2:17:44.560 --> 2:17:52.000]  then as night follows the day, they will be filled with the uncontrollable hubris that they've
[2:17:52.000 --> 2:17:57.280]  demonstrated now in the Gulf of Mexico. And the people of the world, the simple people like you
[2:17:57.280 --> 2:18:03.440]  and me, Alex, have a real, real problem. And it's the same thing over and over again. I think,
[2:18:03.440 --> 2:18:09.520]  well, what was BP called Anglo-American oil? Yeah, that's what they call themselves. BP
[2:18:09.520 --> 2:18:13.120]  is a direct descendant. No, exactly. It's the same company. You're absolutely right in that
[2:18:13.120 --> 2:18:20.400]  Dutch partnership. But I mean, it's the same players over and over again. Yeah. Well, it's
[2:18:20.400 --> 2:18:29.120]  just that they are so powerful. And here's Obama. He was asked just a half hour ago at his press
[2:18:29.120 --> 2:18:36.240]  conference, do you feel a little funny about that decision you made two weeks before the
[2:18:36.240 --> 2:18:42.640]  oil blow up in the Gulf? And when you said that, yeah, we have to drill offshore and these companies
[2:18:42.640 --> 2:18:51.680]  have reduced the dangers greatly. And he said, well, I still think we have to drill offshore,
[2:18:51.680 --> 2:18:58.560]  but my mistake was taking the word of the company's wealth for Pete's sake. Of course,
[2:18:58.560 --> 2:19:04.080]  they take the word of the company's. Look at the people that they had in the interior department,
[2:19:04.720 --> 2:19:09.360]  people who were still there taking bribes and everything else from the oil companies.
[2:19:09.360 --> 2:19:14.640]  The system is corrupt. What well, Mama should have done is come in, got rid of all those people,
[2:19:14.640 --> 2:19:21.040]  giving them jobs in the library if he couldn't fire them and get some real, real control over
[2:19:21.040 --> 2:19:28.800]  these precious resources, despite the, you know, the avarice and the desire of people like BP to
[2:19:29.840 --> 2:19:34.000]  control this important resource. Okay, Redmond Governor, stay there. Let's come back and get
[2:19:34.000 --> 2:19:40.640]  your breakdown of where you see Afghanistan and Pakistan going. And then to the West,
[2:19:42.480 --> 2:19:49.440]  what your intel is from all your sources, is it green light to go into Iran? Who will hit U.S.
[2:19:49.440 --> 2:19:55.520]  operation with Israel? Israel goes it alone. We'll talk about that and a lot more, plus the North
[2:19:55.520 --> 2:20:01.280]  Korea situation. When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind? If it's Berkey

[2:22:14.800 --> 2:22:20.080]  do you do when the U.S. government overextends itself and spends beyond its means? Many investors

[2:24:02.960 --> 2:24:06.080]  I can't wait to get into North Korea and see what Ray McGovern thinks about that.
[2:24:06.720 --> 2:24:10.560]  All I see is headlines everywhere about possible nuclear war and shelling,
[2:24:10.560 --> 2:24:18.160]  CO and the disputed areas with the ships and China's and Bloomberg saying we may shield North
[2:24:18.160 --> 2:24:25.120]  Korea and the Pentagon saying they're ready for war. The war was never terminated. It's been a ceasefire
[2:24:25.120 --> 2:24:28.800]  for 50-plus years. Going back to Ray McGovern, this is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[2:24:29.520 --> 2:24:33.680]  Ray, when I interrupted you earlier with some other questions about why they're there,
[2:24:34.320 --> 2:24:39.760]  where do you see Afghanistan going? I mean, two weeks ago, they said 1000 drones
[2:24:39.760 --> 2:24:45.520]  are being dispatched for Pakistan and Afghanistan and that now they don't have to identify somebody
[2:24:45.520 --> 2:24:50.400]  before they kill them. Just if you look like you're a terrorist, kind of like those kids in Baghdad,
[2:24:50.400 --> 2:24:54.720]  in the minivan, looked like terrorists and reporters with cameras look like terrorists.
[2:24:54.720 --> 2:25:00.320]  I mean, this sounds like an incredible escalation. It sounds like LBJ in 1966.
[2:25:01.360 --> 2:25:06.400]  Well, plenty of you should mention that, Alex, because I was thinking of this wonderful new
[2:25:06.400 --> 2:25:15.760]  airplane, aircraft, that had been developed around then. It was called the B-52 and that was going
[2:25:15.760 --> 2:25:22.960]  to solve all our problems in Vietnam. What we're going to do is bomb the hell out of the Ho Chi Minh
[2:25:22.960 --> 2:25:30.000]  Trail and LBJ came to us intelligence types and said these blue-suited generals are telling me
[2:25:30.000 --> 2:25:37.440]  this will do it. What do you think? Now, we suppressed the laugh, having known about the effect
[2:25:37.440 --> 2:25:44.720]  of aircraft in World War II and knowing that it simply increases the resistance of populations
[2:25:44.720 --> 2:25:50.080]  like the E.P. and the Mies and we waited two days and then we gave them an estimate. We used to do
[2:25:50.080 --> 2:25:55.360]  national intelligence estimates and now they're not done very much anymore and we told the president,
[2:25:55.360 --> 2:26:01.600]  look, Mr. President, Ho Chi Minh is not the kind of person who's going to give up under how many
[2:26:01.600 --> 2:26:07.200]  B-52s or how heavy the bombs they dropped. And besides, Mr. President, you should be aware that
[2:26:07.200 --> 2:26:15.520]  the Ho Chi Minh Trail doesn't look anything like I-81 or I-95 or the George Washington
[2:26:15.520 --> 2:26:23.440]  Memorial Parkway. You can't even see it from the air in many respects. It's about 181 trails, Mr.
[2:26:23.440 --> 2:26:29.200]  President. Ain't no way that B-52s are going to do the job. Now, we were right, of course,
[2:26:29.200 --> 2:26:34.080]  but the corollary there is the president doesn't have to heed intelligence. He just didn't want
[2:26:34.080 --> 2:26:39.520]  to lose a war. And so I said, well, let's try these blue-suited guys. You know, they might be right
[2:26:39.520 --> 2:26:44.960]  and so we tried it and we know the answer. Now, similarly, we are over Afghanistan. We had this
[2:26:44.960 --> 2:26:51.200]  new weapon which most people don't realize, Alex, and I knew about this when it was being developed.
[2:26:51.200 --> 2:26:56.000]  It was developed for a specific purpose and that purpose only. And that was to give us a
[2:26:56.000 --> 2:27:02.160]  hovering capability where we could monitor developments on the ground more than two times a
[2:27:02.160 --> 2:27:08.560]  day, two times a day being when the satellites would pass over these areas, okay? Now, we got
[2:27:08.560 --> 2:27:14.080]  this thing developed. It worked beautifully and then it was shown to some general in the Pentagon
[2:27:14.080 --> 2:27:22.000]  and he said, I want to see the tank. I want to destroy the tank. Put some missiles on that bird.
[2:27:22.000 --> 2:27:30.000]  Therefore, you get predators. You get reapers with hellfire missiles and you get an awful lot
[2:27:30.000 --> 2:27:36.080]  of disenchantment and hostility out of the people in Pakistan in particular that are being bombed
[2:27:36.080 --> 2:27:42.320]  to hell by these things. It's looked on as a very cowardly thing. That's right. At a primitive level,
[2:27:42.320 --> 2:27:47.760]  having like terminator machines out of the sky bombing you and it's literally 22-year-old
[2:27:47.760 --> 2:27:56.640]  zit-faced kids in trailers thousands of miles away in a video game setup and go ahead. You got
[2:27:56.640 --> 2:28:02.160]  a wedding. We think some guys got a gun in there. Everybody's got guns in those countries. It's a
[2:28:02.160 --> 2:28:09.280]  tribal red-blooded type area and they kill 100 innocent people. Now, you've created 1,000 enemies
[2:28:09.280 --> 2:28:14.240]  because their entire family and every cousin they've got who may have loved America back in the 80s,
[2:28:14.240 --> 2:28:19.200]  they're ready to kill. They're ready to trade their life to kill Americans and so the idea is pump
[2:28:19.200 --> 2:28:25.600]  more Americans in. That's exactly right. And you know, people have asked me, these hellfire
[2:28:25.600 --> 2:28:33.200]  missiles, are they accurate? And I say, well, yeah, they are. They're extremely accurate. They're
[2:28:33.200 --> 2:28:39.680]  more accurate than anything we've had up till now. But the question is, how do you identify the targets?
[2:28:39.680 --> 2:28:46.000]  Now, you know, you can really tell what a militant is from 30,000 feet. Can't you give me a break?
[2:28:46.000 --> 2:28:52.560]  You can really find out who the Taliban and the Al-Qaeda types are by asking their neighbors who
[2:28:52.560 --> 2:28:59.760]  have these asking people's neighbors who have unsatisfied grudges against them. The targets
[2:28:59.760 --> 2:29:08.080]  are the name of the game. And if you get targets from people who have grudges or from 22-year-olds
[2:29:08.080 --> 2:29:15.200]  looking from 30,000 feet up, you've got a real problem. What really tells, what I find really
[2:29:15.200 --> 2:29:22.480]  telling Alex is these reapers and these predators, interesting the labels they give these aircraft,
[2:29:22.480 --> 2:29:29.760]  they're controlled by these young NCOs out in Creech Air Force Base near Las Vegas.
[2:29:29.760 --> 2:29:34.880]  Stay there, sir. We got a break. Long segment. We'll go back to Creech Air Force Base and talk
[2:29:34.880 --> 2:29:40.880]  about the predators and drones of the Ray McGovern, CIA analyst, a briefer to the presidents. Very
[2:29:40.880 --> 2:29:44.720]  honored to have him here with us today. He's got a new article out. We'll put that on screen as well.
[2:29:44.720 --> 2:29:53.840]  Stay with us. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:29:58.160 --> 2:30:02.160]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.

[2:30:56.160 --> 2:31:00.400]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap,
[2:31:00.400 --> 2:31:04.400]  not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calvin Soap Company,
[2:31:04.400 --> 2:31:09.600]  a family-owned and operated American company. My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners
[2:31:09.600 --> 2:31:14.160]  are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, air, laundry, and dishes.
[2:31:14.160 --> 2:31:19.040]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[2:32:00.080 --> 2:32:05.200]  Tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[2:32:05.200 --> 2:32:07.680]  It really says that the state is God.
[2:32:07.680 --> 2:32:13.360]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[2:32:13.360 --> 2:32:17.920]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps,
[2:32:17.920 --> 2:32:22.480]  now being expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes how the continuity
[2:32:22.480 --> 2:32:26.000]  of government program has established an old powerful shadow state.
[2:32:26.000 --> 2:32:30.240]  Police state 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[2:32:30.240 --> 2:32:35.520]  Repair to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship, body scammers,
[2:32:35.520 --> 2:32:40.400]  sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[2:32:40.400 --> 2:32:43.920]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.

[2:32:54.080 --> 2:33:05.120]  We're going back to Ray McGovern here in a moment to get into the predator drones and
[2:33:05.120 --> 2:33:08.480]  where he sees Afghanistan and Pakistan going.
[2:33:11.280 --> 2:33:14.480]  And basically he says they're repeating the same things that happened in Vietnam's
[2:33:14.480 --> 2:33:21.120]  but now they have fancier weaponry. We'll go back to him in just a moment.
[2:33:21.120 --> 2:33:27.520]  We're going into North Korea with him and the situation with Iran, which to me is even scarier
[2:33:27.520 --> 2:33:32.640]  the whole Iran situation. A quagmire is one thing and get a lot of troops killed and waste a lot
[2:33:32.640 --> 2:33:39.360]  of money, but war with Iran in my layman research looks even worse. So we'll discuss that in a
[2:33:39.360 --> 2:33:44.160]  moment with our guest. Survivalseedbank.com. I'll say about a few of the sponsors that have made
[2:33:44.160 --> 2:33:49.040]  today's radio show possible. I love gardening. These are non-GMO, non-hybrid seeds. And you
[2:33:49.040 --> 2:33:54.320]  ought to buy one seed bank. I mean seeds last for decades, well longer than that. Papyrus from
[2:33:54.320 --> 2:33:59.520]  3,000 year old tombs in Egypt have been grown, but you won't need it in 3,000 years. We know that.
[2:33:59.520 --> 2:34:04.960]  The point is, as a Survivalseedbank, a time capsule, buy one, plant one, save the other,
[2:34:04.960 --> 2:34:12.800]  or just buy one. Survivalseedbank.com 877-327-0365. It's good to start to become self-sufficient
[2:34:12.800 --> 2:34:18.720]  with this depression the central banks have designed to turn us into their economic slaves.
[2:34:18.720 --> 2:34:28.480]  Survivalseedbank.com 877-327-0365. And one other great sponsor I want to tell you about.
[2:34:29.360 --> 2:34:38.080]  I love the swords, the knives, the machetes, the tools, the tasers, the pepper spray,
[2:34:38.080 --> 2:34:45.040]  everything you need at weaponsuniverse.com. It's weapons-universe. So just the word weapons and

[2:34:55.120 --> 2:35:01.040]  and just a lot of amazing stuff and great prices by, you name it, names like Cold Steel,
[2:35:01.600 --> 2:35:07.760]  Smith and Wesson, weapons-universe.com and their great patriots. Check them out today at
[2:35:07.760 --> 2:35:11.920]  weapons-universe.com. Okay, Ray, I've been adding my points. You got cut off by the break. You were
[2:35:11.920 --> 2:35:17.040]  getting into, they're out in Nevada. It's one of the main command centers. I've seen it on the news.
[2:35:17.040 --> 2:35:24.320]  People in trailers and he's like, it showed one of the young men. He goes, I love video games.
[2:35:24.320 --> 2:35:28.240]  Now I control the predator and it showed him sitting there and they're going, okay,
[2:35:28.240 --> 2:35:34.000]  you've got clearance. Hit him. Go ahead and give it to him. And I mean, just it's so bizarre to
[2:35:34.000 --> 2:35:40.640]  see this. Break it down for us. Well, let me put it this way. The chaplains out there at
[2:35:40.640 --> 2:35:47.200]  Creech Air Force Base, they're working overtime because some of the young fellas have a conscience.
[2:35:48.320 --> 2:35:53.200]  They do their work during the day. They go home and have dinner with their families and they think,
[2:35:54.720 --> 2:36:00.400]  the wife says, well, we'll have to have things go at work today. And they can't quite say, well,
[2:36:00.400 --> 2:36:06.640]  we killed the, you know, we shot hellfire missiles at 30 groups and we're not real sure.
[2:36:06.640 --> 2:36:14.560]  So long story short, these chaplains are actually being visited regularly by these poor NCOs who
[2:36:14.560 --> 2:36:19.680]  are ordered to do this kind of thing and have it on their conscience to their credit. The other guys,
[2:36:19.680 --> 2:36:25.200]  now the other guys are the ones in Langley, Virginia who are working for the CIA. They're the ones that
[2:36:25.200 --> 2:36:31.760]  have the joysticks there and they're the ones that fly over Pakistan. Why? Well, because we're
[2:36:31.760 --> 2:36:37.600]  literally, or at least technically not at war with Pakistan, so it has to be the CIA. It can't be
[2:36:37.600 --> 2:36:44.480]  the Air Force. Well, it's the same sort of thing. People who identify these targets, either from
[2:36:44.480 --> 2:36:51.360]  people who may have grievances against this particular village or people who think they see
[2:36:52.960 --> 2:36:59.040]  militants, whatever they look like, as distinguished from wedding parties from 30,000 feet. So,
[2:36:59.040 --> 2:37:08.000]  you know, the whole thing is an indication of the lack of leadership in the military of our
[2:37:08.000 --> 2:37:14.080]  country as well as the political side, because you can't win a war this way. All you can do is
[2:37:14.080 --> 2:37:19.360]  alienate the affections of people. And what I keep telling people is that in Pakistan,
[2:37:20.400 --> 2:37:27.920]  if you take the population of Pakistan, 160, 570 million, okay, that's 40 million more
[2:37:27.920 --> 2:37:36.560]  than the population of Afghanistan, Iran, and Iraq put together. Besides, of course, Pakistan
[2:37:36.560 --> 2:37:42.960]  has nuclear weapons. Now, which I would ask you, which country should be the most important
[2:37:42.960 --> 2:37:47.680]  not to alienate the population in? Well, sir, we've seen Pakistani leaders and we've got an
[2:37:47.680 --> 2:37:54.240]  article up on infowars.com that's got the newscast and even ABC News with Pakistani leaders saying,
[2:37:54.240 --> 2:37:59.520]  look, your government is running a lot of the Taliban and al-Qaeda and they're using it to
[2:37:59.520 --> 2:38:06.720]  destabilize our country. And you know, and that's what Hamid Ghul, who I was bizarrely
[2:38:06.720 --> 2:38:10.800]  contacted by a year and a half ago when he came on this show, and it made national news when he
[2:38:10.800 --> 2:38:16.880]  did. And he said that they're killing these tribal groups to actually get them up in arms.
[2:38:16.880 --> 2:38:20.720]  And that's what Gerald Salenta, the trans forecaster, says. He says, look, the U.S.
[2:38:20.720 --> 2:38:24.720]  government isn't going to have to stage terror attacks as a pretext to get the American people
[2:38:24.720 --> 2:38:30.000]  to give their liberty up. You kill enough Pakistanis who are tribal. They're going to come over here
[2:38:30.000 --> 2:38:35.200]  and they're going to blow stuff up. Well, we've seen the effects of that, haven't we?
[2:38:36.560 --> 2:38:41.280]  You know, when Boyce said we have to kill them over there before they come here,
[2:38:41.920 --> 2:38:48.320]  well, you know, that was ridiculous in the extreme. What we need to do is figure out what's
[2:38:48.320 --> 2:38:54.240]  really going on in those countries, why they hate us. You know, it ain't because of our democracy
[2:38:54.240 --> 2:39:01.600]  or of our freedom. Now, with respect to the Pakistanis, you can see U.S. high-level pronouncements
[2:39:01.600 --> 2:39:09.280]  say we're working on the Pakistanis to show them to demonstrate that their greatest threat is not
[2:39:09.280 --> 2:39:14.080]  from India. No, no, it's from these insurgents, these militants, these people that are in the
[2:39:14.080 --> 2:39:20.800]  tribal areas, right? Well, give me a break. There's no kind of rhetoric or logic that is going to
[2:39:20.800 --> 2:39:27.760]  persuade the Pakistanis that their main enemy isn't India. Of course it is. And so why do they keep
[2:39:27.760 --> 2:39:33.200]  feeding the Taliban? Why do they keep making it difficult for the U.S. to end the job there?
[2:39:33.200 --> 2:39:39.200]  Because they see an advantage in keeping the pot boiling in Afghanistan. They don't want,
[2:39:39.200 --> 2:39:45.600]  they don't want an Indian-dominated government in Afghanistan. They want to keep the pot boiling.
[2:39:45.600 --> 2:39:50.000]  And so all these pronouncements about the U.S., you know, we're going to proudly persuade them,
[2:39:50.000 --> 2:39:55.600]  well, we're going to persuade them that their strategic interest is not in India, but in these,
[2:39:55.600 --> 2:39:59.440]  give me a break. We're never going to persuade them of that. And so this thing will just keep
[2:39:59.440 --> 2:40:05.120]  going and going. And the worst news, of course, is that our congressional people, even the good
[2:40:05.120 --> 2:40:10.560]  ones like Dave Obey, have now caved again. And it looks like there will be an escalation to the
[2:40:10.560 --> 2:40:16.480]  tune of $33 billion. And that will buy many more months of killing and war.
[2:40:16.480 --> 2:40:21.840]  And people can go to Common Dreams website and others and read your new article. Give folks
[2:40:21.840 --> 2:40:27.120]  that title again one more time, right? Well, it's a letter to David Obey, who's the head of appropriations.
[2:40:27.120 --> 2:40:35.760]  It's a memo that says, look, you know, you called Afghanistan a fool's errand. And then
[2:40:35.760 --> 2:40:41.760]  you said, yeah, but we have to fund it. That doesn't make any logical sense, Dave. What's
[2:40:41.760 --> 2:40:47.520]  really going on here? And what's really going on here is he's out of there in January. He wants
[2:40:47.520 --> 2:40:53.920]  to not alienate the affections of the Washington establishment. And he's letting go to the house,
[2:40:53.920 --> 2:41:01.120]  a bill that will include enough lipstick, namely a $23 billion for teachers, so that the $33 billion
[2:41:01.120 --> 2:41:06.800]  for Afghanistan war will go through. That is unconscionable. He knows better than that.
[2:41:06.800 --> 2:41:12.560]  And he can call me an idiot liberal, or that's what he calls some of my friends. But what I'm
[2:41:12.560 --> 2:41:17.920]  telling him is that he's a terrible disappointment because he should have stood his ground and not
[2:41:17.920 --> 2:41:24.400]  confess to being quote, bone tired. And again, this has nothing to do with liberal conservative.
[2:41:24.400 --> 2:41:30.160]  It's right and wrong. Obama is expanding the wars. Bush expanded it. This is the policy
[2:41:30.720 --> 2:41:35.040]  of the establishment. But just briefly, because I want to get into Iran and the North Korean,
[2:41:35.040 --> 2:41:38.880]  the time we've got left with you, picking your brain, we appreciate the time. And of course,
[2:41:38.880 --> 2:41:42.560]  you just come on out of the goodness. You're hard to do it. I wish you had a book or something we
[2:41:42.560 --> 2:41:46.720]  could promote for folks to get your word out even more. But hopefully that's coming in the future.
[2:41:46.720 --> 2:41:52.240]  But over the years, you've been so gracious is my point. What is the exit strategy? Is the exit
[2:41:52.240 --> 2:41:59.360]  strategy never leave like Germany or Japan or South Korea? I mean, is the exit strategy quagmire?
[2:42:00.560 --> 2:42:06.400]  Well, I asked the honeyed side of former ambassador in Afghanistan. He's actually in
[2:42:06.400 --> 2:42:12.640]  Afghanistan. I asked him at a ran conference two months ago. I said, you know, you don't say much
[2:42:12.640 --> 2:42:17.920]  about the oil pipeline anymore or the gas, natural gas pipeline to Afghanistan. Where does it stand?
[2:42:17.920 --> 2:42:25.200]  You were in that from the beginning. He thought for a second and he said, well, you know, with
[2:42:25.200 --> 2:42:35.200]  all the violence and all the fighting there along the pipeline route, we can possibly build it right
[2:42:35.200 --> 2:42:42.400]  now. Now, I wasn't allowed to follow up, but boy follow was going to be. Oh, so so that's why we're
[2:42:42.400 --> 2:42:48.160]  there to put down the violence to get the Taliban out of there and then clear a path for the oil
[2:42:48.160 --> 2:42:55.040]  and gas pipeline. That is the ambassador to how you've done. So, you know, it's a strategic
[2:42:55.040 --> 2:43:02.320]  sort of thing where where the US will not act in any other way than as an empire. And you need to
[2:43:02.320 --> 2:43:06.000]  have a little bit of humility because we're not going to be able to call the shots in that part
[2:43:06.000 --> 2:43:10.160]  of the world anymore. Well, here's my next question. I mean, as you know, you've studied it more than
[2:43:10.160 --> 2:43:15.440]  more than most out there. Nobody's ever been able to successfully continually conquer these people.
[2:43:16.080 --> 2:43:21.440]  I mean, can you just briefly sum up in maybe two minutes the mindset of these tribal groups,
[2:43:21.440 --> 2:43:27.200]  these pastures and others in Afghanistan and in areas of Pakistan, because from my layman research
[2:43:27.200 --> 2:43:33.520]  and what every other analyst going back 400 years, people who fought there have said is the more you
[2:43:33.520 --> 2:43:38.720]  kill them, the more they fight, just like Americans used to be. I mean, I mean, you know, what happened
[2:43:38.720 --> 2:43:42.880]  with the British here? I mean, that's what any red-blooded group is going to do. They're not
[2:43:42.880 --> 2:43:46.800]  going to stop fighting. They're, you know, they're not drinking fluoride and watching. I love Lucy.
[2:43:46.800 --> 2:43:53.520]  They're not fat, dumb, happy Americans. Well, I'd rather be, you know, back in 1776, I sure would
[2:43:53.520 --> 2:43:59.520]  rather have been an insurgent rather than a, you know, a cooperator with the Tories. In a word,
[2:44:00.720 --> 2:44:07.920]  there are these strange people in Afghanistan. They're in tribes mostly, and they have this
[2:44:07.920 --> 2:44:14.800]  strange resistance to invaders coming into the country. And they have the benefit of these huge
[2:44:14.800 --> 2:44:23.200]  mountains and very vulnerable valleys. And so going back 2,500 years, Alex, to Alexander the
[2:44:23.200 --> 2:44:30.080]  Great, who was the first of about seven big countries trying to conquer Afghanistan, they've
[2:44:30.080 --> 2:44:38.480]  been able to, the tribal leaders have been able to block that. And, you know, what I tell people is,
[2:44:38.480 --> 2:44:42.880]  you know why they call Alexander the Great? Well, they call him the Great because he was
[2:44:42.880 --> 2:44:47.680]  sensible enough to look at the height of those mountains, to look at the casualties he was
[2:44:47.680 --> 2:44:53.200]  already taking out his flanks from these, quote, militants and turn around and say, this wasn't a
[2:44:53.200 --> 2:44:57.760]  good idea. I'm going back to Asia Minor where I, you know, I couldn't be allowed last all this.
[2:44:57.760 --> 2:45:04.160]  That's what made him great. From him, since him, you have the Indians, you have the Persians,
[2:45:04.160 --> 2:45:09.360]  you have the Mongolians under Genghis Khan, you have the British, you have the Russians,
[2:45:09.360 --> 2:45:13.440]  and now the Americans are going to succeed where all those didn't give me a break.
[2:45:13.440 --> 2:45:19.360]  Oh boy, so what we're going to be there in five years still, it's just never going to end, a
[2:45:19.360 --> 2:45:24.240]  meat grinder they feed troops into, and out of it comes oil, pipelines, and opium.
[2:45:24.800 --> 2:45:29.040]  Well, I'm hopeful that the American people, you know, if they listen to people like us,
[2:45:29.040 --> 2:45:34.480]  finally, I think, I have a basic faith in the American people, they're good sense, and I think
[2:45:34.480 --> 2:45:39.760]  there's a limit to what they will tolerate. The big challenge, of course, Alex, and the reason
[2:45:39.760 --> 2:45:45.440]  I come on your show and applaud what you're doing is that you are one of the few people that tell
[2:45:45.440 --> 2:45:50.720]  it like it is. You're not done to the fawning corporate media, and that's what we need. We
[2:45:50.720 --> 2:45:55.680]  need people to listen and then act, and I think action is necessary right now.
[2:45:55.680 --> 2:45:59.120]  Well, again, for those that just joined us, I'm not heaping laurels on you, sir, but people
[2:45:59.120 --> 2:46:05.520]  need to know you've been right. A full year and a half before it came out with Cy Hirsch and New
[2:46:05.520 --> 2:46:10.880]  Yorker magazine and was confirmed that Cheney wanted to paint up patrol boats blue and have
[2:46:10.880 --> 2:46:15.760]  Navy SEALs attack our own ships, and that was confirmed. Bush, of all people said, no, we're
[2:46:15.760 --> 2:46:22.000]  not doing that, but it just shows the mental level. You came on air and said, well, if I was
[2:46:22.000 --> 2:46:26.480]  Cheney and Bush, they'll probably paint up some ships like Iranians. This is on record on the
[2:46:26.480 --> 2:46:30.960]  show and attack our ships. And later I said, did you have inside intel? You just said, no,
[2:46:30.960 --> 2:46:35.200]  that's how these people work. And now I want to shift gears and ask the difference between
[2:46:35.200 --> 2:46:41.360]  Cheney and Bush and Obama. It's now come out, and I have it here in my stack, Washington Post,
[2:46:41.360 --> 2:46:48.080]  CNN, Business Insider. Cheney had gotten his way. We would have gone to war with Russia,
[2:46:48.080 --> 2:46:53.600]  and it's basically admitted in Ron Azmus's new book, you know, who was inside these meetings,
[2:46:54.480 --> 2:47:00.480]  that, yeah, NATO was part of it. They launched the attack, you know, backed through Georgia
[2:47:00.480 --> 2:47:05.520]  against South Ossetia on 888, and that Cheney wanted to go ahead and have nuclear war. I mean,
[2:47:05.520 --> 2:47:10.400]  that really shows these are completely unstable people, like, you know, Curtis LeMay or somebody.
[2:47:10.960 --> 2:47:16.800]  And so that mindset has that carried over into Obama, because when I see him out there, at least
[2:47:16.800 --> 2:47:24.080]  at some levels, supporting Israel and Netanyahu, saying they may hit Iran, can you speak to the
[2:47:24.080 --> 2:47:29.840]  mindset in the Pentagon? Is any of this Cheney stuff left there versus what's going on in the
[2:47:29.840 --> 2:47:35.360]  White House now? And then how that posture, the posture you believe from your research is there,
[2:47:35.360 --> 2:47:41.520]  how that's going to affect what goes on in Iran and now North Korea?
[2:47:43.040 --> 2:47:49.920]  Well, Iran, I think, is the most pressing issue. It's the one that the president has most difficulty
[2:47:49.920 --> 2:47:56.960]  with, because the pressure from what is called the Likud lobby, how the people call it the
[2:47:56.960 --> 2:48:03.440]  Israel lobby, is immense. And that's been demonstrated recently by a whole string of events.
[2:48:04.160 --> 2:48:09.360]  Dennis Blair, a former four-star admiral who headed up the National Intelligence
[2:48:09.360 --> 2:48:16.480]  set up in our country, was canned last week. Why? Well, there were a bunch of misadventures with
[2:48:16.480 --> 2:48:22.400]  not catching potential terrorists. But the basic reason, in my view, that he was canned was that
[2:48:22.400 --> 2:48:29.600]  he had the temerity 15 months ago to appoint a person to be the chief analyst in our government,
[2:48:29.600 --> 2:48:36.480]  the chief intelligence analyst, a person named Ches Freeman, who made the very bad mistake
[2:48:36.480 --> 2:48:43.440]  of saying publicly that he thought Palestinians also had rights as human beings in addition to
[2:48:43.440 --> 2:48:49.600]  Israelis. Now, what happened was he was appointed by Dennis Blair. This is not a cabinet appointment.
[2:48:49.600 --> 2:48:54.960]  This is within his own little purview, head of the National Intelligence Council, Ches Freeman.
[2:48:55.520 --> 2:49:01.440]  He was appointed in the morning, and he had lunch with David Broder of the post. And David said,
[2:49:01.440 --> 2:49:06.240]  aren't you expecting a lot of opposition? And Freeman said, nah, it's going to sail through.
[2:49:06.240 --> 2:49:12.160]  Then Blair got up about the appointment and saying he was a terrific person.
[2:49:12.160 --> 2:49:19.200]  By five o'clock in the afternoon, Senator Chuck Schumer, Senator Lieberman from Connecticut,
[2:49:19.200 --> 2:49:23.840]  had gotten to Rahm Emanuel in the White House and said, we can't have this guy.
[2:49:23.840 --> 2:49:32.240]  He's too unbiased. He doesn't react with knee-jerk solidity to the interests of Israel.
[2:49:32.240 --> 2:49:39.040]  And so Blair had to go back to Freeman and say, you know, I'm going to have to ask you to ask me
[2:49:39.760 --> 2:49:45.840]  to withhold your nomination, to reverse your appointment. It wasn't like a nomination. He
[2:49:45.840 --> 2:49:51.200]  had been appointed. So he served as National Intelligence Director for eight hours, okay?
[2:49:51.200 --> 2:49:55.840]  Now, that is unprecedented. I've seen a lot of stuff in my 50 years in Washington,
[2:49:55.840 --> 2:50:01.280]  but never before have I seen the Israel lobby or any other lobby derail an appointment that had
[2:50:01.280 --> 2:50:06.960]  already been made in the bowels of the intelligence community. Now, to the extent...
[2:50:06.960 --> 2:50:10.400]  So you're saying Israel's got pull that our government doesn't even have?
[2:50:10.400 --> 2:50:14.640]  Well, that seems to be the case. I had hoped it would be different with Obama, but it's not.
[2:50:14.640 --> 2:50:20.640]  Now, the other thing that's really important is this. We broached an agreement to Iran,
[2:50:21.360 --> 2:50:28.000]  which would have resulted in about 70% of their low-enriched uranium being shipped out of the
[2:50:28.000 --> 2:50:33.280]  country for reprocessing for their medical reactor, okay? That was October of last year.
[2:50:33.920 --> 2:50:42.000]  Now, that didn't work out partly because of the insurgents in Iran
[2:50:42.000 --> 2:50:46.160]  and funded by the U.S., Israel, and Pakistan.
[2:50:46.160 --> 2:50:49.280]  Ray, I'm sorry. We got a break. Stay there. I'll see if I can twist your arm to stay
[2:50:49.280 --> 2:50:53.120]  five in the next hour, so we have at least 10 minutes of airtime to finish up on Iran
[2:50:53.120 --> 2:50:55.120]  and briefly North Korea. Stay with us.

[2:54:01.200 --> 2:54:06.400]  We're scheduled later in the next hour to have the runner-up in Miss USA pageant.
[2:54:06.400 --> 2:54:12.720]  She lost because she was against Arizona having a state copy of the federal law.
[2:54:12.720 --> 2:54:17.360]  There's exactly a copy of the federal law. So she's going to be popping in with us.
[2:54:17.360 --> 2:54:20.880]  Ray McGovern is with us for this segment and the next. We really appreciate his time.
[2:54:20.880 --> 2:54:23.840]  Here's some other news. We had Congressman Ron Paul on yesterday.
[2:54:23.840 --> 2:54:29.200]  Ron Paul said inside sources told him Fed is panicking at mass awakening.
[2:54:29.200 --> 2:54:37.200]  And if Ron Paul says you can bank it, that's up on GCNLive.com, the article by Paul Joseph Watson.
[2:54:37.200 --> 2:54:41.840]  That's GCNLive, GCNLive.com. Okay, Ray, we've only got about four minutes here,
[2:54:41.840 --> 2:54:44.880]  five minutes in the next segment. Again, very thankful for your time.
[2:54:44.880 --> 2:54:49.760]  You were finishing up with the situation with Iran. Netanyahu says they may strike,
[2:54:50.640 --> 2:54:54.720]  talking to folks in intelligence, out of intelligence, with your ear to the ground.
[2:54:54.720 --> 2:54:59.520]  Ron, is it on the front burner again? And what's the time frame? And then see,
[2:55:00.320 --> 2:55:06.560]  what will happen if we do attack? Well, to address your last point first,
[2:55:06.560 --> 2:55:13.280]  Alex, it would be a catastrophe if we and or the Israelis attacked Iran.
[2:55:14.320 --> 2:55:18.080]  Among other things, they have the option of closing the Strait of Hormuz,
[2:55:18.080 --> 2:55:26.560]  to which about a third of the trade oil goes through for the world.
[2:55:27.120 --> 2:55:31.680]  And talk about a recession, well, that would throw the world into a tailspin,
[2:55:31.680 --> 2:55:37.200]  given the dependence on oil. The situation right now is highly interesting.
[2:55:38.000 --> 2:55:42.800]  The bottom line is that the Israel lobby has shown its power once again.
[2:55:42.800 --> 2:55:48.640]  And, now get this, this is the important conclusion, at least from my analysis.
[2:55:49.520 --> 2:55:56.320]  Neither Israel nor the United States is terribly worried about a nuclear weapon in Iran.
[2:55:57.760 --> 2:56:04.240]  If they were, they would have welcomed this new tripartite deal between Brazil, Turkey,
[2:56:04.240 --> 2:56:12.080]  and Iran, which provides for half, fully half of the low-enriched uranium to go out of country
[2:56:12.080 --> 2:56:17.440]  into Turkey. Now, that's the uranium that would have to be refined to a higher degree
[2:56:17.440 --> 2:56:23.840]  to make a bomb. So, if half of Iran's uranium is going out of country for a whole year,
[2:56:23.840 --> 2:56:28.080]  wouldn't you think that the Israelis in the US would be happy about that?
[2:56:28.080 --> 2:56:32.960]  Yeah, Iran is buckling. I mean, every time, going back, as you know, five years,
[2:56:32.960 --> 2:56:35.920]  they try to be friendly, they get slapped down.
[2:56:35.920 --> 2:56:40.000]  Yeah. Well, what happened, as soon as this deal was announced,
[2:56:40.000 --> 2:56:42.880]  Hillary Clinton got up and said, no, no, no, we're not going to go that route.
[2:56:44.320 --> 2:56:47.200]  That's naive. What we're going to do is sanctions in the UN,
[2:56:47.200 --> 2:56:51.120]  and we're persuaded the Russians and the Chinese, and we're going to just get these guys.
[2:56:51.120 --> 2:56:54.320]  Well, you know, that's really interesting, because you know what?
[2:56:55.360 --> 2:57:02.240]  The President of the United States encouraged the head of Brazil and the head of Turkey
[2:57:02.240 --> 2:57:07.360]  to work out this deal. And we have that in a letter from President Obama.
[2:57:07.360 --> 2:57:11.760]  You won't find this in the New York Times, by the way, but if you look in the Sao Paulo
[2:57:11.760 --> 2:57:17.200]  press there in Brazil, you'll see the text of a letter from the President of the United States,
[2:57:17.200 --> 2:57:23.360]  which says to the President of Brazil, from our point of view, a decision by Iran to send half
[2:57:23.360 --> 2:57:30.080]  of its low-enriched uranium abroad would generate confidence and reduce regional tensions by cutting
[2:57:30.080 --> 2:57:34.080]  Iran's stockpile. So, we're about to break, but to interrupt, correct me if I'm wrong,
[2:57:34.080 --> 2:57:37.680]  basically it's showing there's a fight going on inside the Obama administration,
[2:57:37.680 --> 2:57:41.120]  and that they were trying to do something reasonable, but somebody else has come in and
[2:57:41.120 --> 2:57:45.680]  said, uh-uh. Yeah, that's not going to wash in November, they said, because the lobby will object
[2:57:45.680 --> 2:57:52.320]  to that. That is incredible. It really is, and you won't find this in the New York Times,
[2:57:52.320 --> 2:57:58.720]  will you? But that's the text of the President's letter to Brazil, and Hillary Clinton and the
[2:57:58.720 --> 2:58:05.200]  other neocons, and those particularly susceptible to influence from the, from the liquid lobby
[2:58:05.200 --> 2:58:10.800]  have put the kibosh on what should be a very, very favorable, very encouraging development,
[2:58:10.800 --> 2:58:16.080]  namely for Iran to ship half of its uranium out of country. So, we're coming back with only five
[2:58:16.080 --> 2:58:21.760]  more minutes, but just fast when we come back, watch the game plan then. Game plan is regime
[2:58:21.760 --> 2:58:27.120]  change, that's what they care about, and anything that will make Ahmadinejad look more reasonable
[2:58:27.120 --> 2:58:32.240]  or make Iran look better, they're against because they don't care about the uranium,
[2:58:32.240 --> 2:58:37.040]  they care about regime change. We'll talk about North Korea coming up.

[3:00:06.320 --> 3:00:13.360]  All right, we got the runner up for Miss USA on who lost because she is for stage rights,
[3:00:13.360 --> 3:00:15.600]  so she's going to be joining us in the next segment.
[3:00:15.600 --> 3:00:20.160]  Red McGovern, you've got the floor, former CIA top analyst to the presidents.
[3:00:20.800 --> 3:00:25.200]  You wanted to finish up with the neocons admitting it's not about nukes in Iran,
[3:00:25.200 --> 3:00:28.320]  and then briefly the situation on the Korean Peninsula.
[3:00:29.520 --> 3:00:35.760]  Sure, I think the most recent very clear indication of what bothers the neocons and the
[3:00:35.760 --> 3:00:45.280]  Israel lobby is in Tom Friedman's, he's a very much pro-Israel fellow, his op-ed in the New York
[3:00:45.280 --> 3:00:50.880]  Times yesterday. He's got a couple of lies in it. He says experts say that they still have enough
[3:00:50.880 --> 3:00:56.320]  uranium to do a nuclear weapon, that's wrong. The intelligence community does not say that.
[3:00:56.320 --> 3:01:04.320]  They also suggest that the Iranian facilities are not under UN inspections, that's wrong.
[3:01:04.320 --> 3:01:08.960]  What makes it clear is he's not interested in the uranium, he's interested in regime change,
[3:01:08.960 --> 3:01:15.360]  and he finishes up with that appeal. So what we need to realize here is that this whole thing
[3:01:15.360 --> 3:01:21.920]  is easily explainable. Why the US and why the Israelis would not welcome the shipping out of
[3:01:21.920 --> 3:01:28.080]  half of Iran's uranium for reprocessing elsewhere is because they don't care about that. They care
[3:01:28.080 --> 3:01:33.600]  about regime change, and what they're trying to do is get that to happen largely through a lot of
[3:01:33.600 --> 3:01:39.600]  covert action, support of disparate groups within Iran, now openly acknowledged by the New York
[3:01:39.600 --> 3:01:46.800]  Times article yesterday, and that's what put the kibosh on the last deal. In October,
[3:01:46.800 --> 3:01:54.880]  Jundala, one of the militant dissidents, actually insurgent groups in Iran, supported by Israel,
[3:01:54.880 --> 3:02:03.680]  us, UK, and Pakistan killed five senior Iranian Revolutionary Guards generals, and that's what
[3:02:03.680 --> 3:02:09.280]  put the kibosh on the last deal. Now it's interesting to see that New York Times is advertising the
[3:02:09.280 --> 3:02:15.040]  same kind of activity. Now we'll see how hard Israeli and United States tries to put the kibosh
[3:02:15.040 --> 3:02:21.360]  on this deal, which really should go through and would obviate the necessity. So they're moving us
[3:02:21.360 --> 3:02:27.680]  towards war and everything they can to sabotage a peace process, and this will go down in history
[3:02:27.680 --> 3:02:32.960]  either way. All right, two minutes left, sir. North Korean. Well, you know, Alex, it's really
[3:02:32.960 --> 3:02:38.480]  interesting because we don't have the whole story on what happened. It looks pretty sure that a
[3:02:38.480 --> 3:02:45.680]  North Korean torpedo did hit this in South Korean ship, but the details have not been released.
[3:02:45.680 --> 3:02:50.880]  They've been given to the Russians and the Chinese, but not to us. The problem is that there's an
[3:02:50.880 --> 3:02:56.560]  armistice. There's not a peace agreement, and there are disputed territories. There are North
[3:02:56.560 --> 3:03:02.400]  Korean and South Korean fishermen fighting over crabs every year, and this is the reason. And there
[3:03:02.400 --> 3:03:12.000]  are South Korean ships and North Korean ships both killed or sunk. 1999, a North Korean ship went down
[3:03:12.000 --> 3:03:19.360]  with 30 killed and 70 wounded. So unless they get that shoreline and that international boundary
[3:03:19.360 --> 3:03:24.240]  delineated, this is going to keep happening. So this should not be blown out of proportion and
[3:03:24.240 --> 3:03:30.880]  still less should Hillary Clinton use the same language used by Dean Atchison back in 1950
[3:03:30.880 --> 3:03:37.840]  that this is, quote, unprovoked aggression, end quote. It may be a provocation. It may be retaliation.
[3:03:37.840 --> 3:03:43.840]  We just don't know yet. But we know Kim Jong-il looks like a scarecrow, looks like death warmed
[3:03:43.840 --> 3:03:49.280]  over. So anytime we could see a collapse of the regime, and who knows how that'll go. So it's
[3:03:49.280 --> 3:03:54.240]  another powder keg. That's exactly right. No one really knows what's going on within that country.
[3:03:54.240 --> 3:03:59.520]  And so it's really hard to guess as to what the motivation might have been other than the normal
[3:03:59.520 --> 3:04:09.120]  sort of jousting, the normal trying to head off ships from the other country. Well, that's good
[3:04:09.120 --> 3:04:13.360]  news to hear that you're not as concerned about North Korea as the media has been hyping it to
[3:04:13.360 --> 3:04:17.920]  be. So we'll continue to watch that. I appreciate you coming on to cover what's happening all over
[3:04:17.920 --> 3:04:23.680]  the planet in the geopolitical breakdown. And I look forward to talking to Ray McGovern, a retired
[3:04:23.680 --> 3:04:29.040]  former senior CIA analyst, to the president. God bless you, sir. Thank you. You're most welcome.
[3:04:29.840 --> 3:04:34.240]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I'm very excited about our next guest. And we are going to open
[3:04:34.240 --> 3:04:42.560]  the phones up for her. A lot of supporters out there, Miss Oklahoma, run her up in Miss USA.
[3:04:43.120 --> 3:04:46.640]  And the media reported she would have won if she'd have been against states' rights.
[3:04:46.640 --> 3:04:51.760]  She'll be joining us coming up. She'll be right back in FullWars.com.

[3:05:54.560 --> 3:05:59.120]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle
[3:05:59.120 --> 3:06:04.320]  and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be all I
[3:06:04.320 --> 3:06:10.000]  can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones. Food is your only ammunition.
[3:06:10.000 --> 3:06:14.160]  How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts?
[3:06:14.160 --> 3:06:18.800]  When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food?
[3:06:18.800 --> 3:06:22.880]  Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself,
[3:06:22.880 --> 3:06:27.360]  will you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems
[3:06:27.360 --> 3:06:32.960]  if you have a good food supply. Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[3:06:32.960 --> 3:06:38.240]  How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones.
[3:06:38.240 --> 3:06:45.600]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633
[3:06:45.600 --> 3:06:52.800]  or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com. Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[3:06:53.680 --> 3:06:58.320]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds
[3:06:58.320 --> 3:07:02.400]  in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[3:07:02.400 --> 3:07:06.080]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true,
[3:07:06.080 --> 3:07:08.880]  seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country,
[3:07:08.880 --> 3:07:13.440]  and it's possible that could even happen again. So our friends at Solutions from Science have
[3:07:13.440 --> 3:07:18.640]  put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds. They call it a survival seed bank,
[3:07:18.640 --> 3:07:23.440]  and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family.
[3:07:23.440 --> 3:07:27.600]  And here's the best part. These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way,
[3:07:27.600 --> 3:07:32.400]  and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden. So visit them today
[3:07:32.400 --> 3:07:41.280]  at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[3:07:41.280 --> 3:07:50.320]  That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[3:07:50.320 --> 3:07:53.040]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[3:07:53.040 --> 3:07:54.800]  Oscar Nunez, your question please.
[3:07:56.240 --> 3:07:57.760]  Hello, how are you?
[3:07:57.760 --> 3:07:59.600]  I'm doing so great. Thank you.
[3:07:59.600 --> 3:08:04.560]  Alrighty. Arizona's new immigration statute authorizes law enforcement authorities
[3:08:05.200 --> 3:08:09.840]  to check the citizenship of anyone they believe may be in the country illegally.
[3:08:09.840 --> 3:08:17.680]  Now, listen to the question before you move. Critics say this may amount to racial profiling.
[3:08:18.240 --> 3:08:22.720]  Do you think that this should be mandated by the state or by the federal government?
[3:08:22.720 --> 3:08:29.600]  I'm a huge believer in states' rights. I think that's what's so wonderful about America.
[3:08:37.280 --> 3:08:40.960]  So I think it's perfectly fine for Arizona to create that law,
[3:08:41.840 --> 3:08:46.320]  and I am against illegal immigration, but I'm also against racial profiling.
[3:08:46.320 --> 3:08:47.840]  So I see both sides in the picture.
[3:08:49.280 --> 3:08:50.560]  Thank you all so much.
[3:08:50.560 --> 3:08:57.360]  Now, I don't normally watch Unipadgets. I don't watch a lot of television,
[3:08:57.360 --> 3:09:00.800]  but when I am watching the news, I see highlights of it. I'm obviously red-blooded,
[3:09:00.800 --> 3:09:03.840]  so my eyes are trained like a wolf looking at a, you know,
[3:09:04.880 --> 3:09:10.320]  but the issue here is that I happen to be up here while this was live, turned on the television,
[3:09:10.320 --> 3:09:17.520]  and so all the ladies come out, and I remember looking at Morgan Elizabeth Woolard, Ms. Oklahoma,
[3:09:17.520 --> 3:09:22.480]  thinking, well, she certainly stands out because it's more than just, look, she's obviously beautiful.
[3:09:22.480 --> 3:09:28.080]  I could tell she was intelligent. She had that spark about her, and it's great to see her so
[3:09:28.080 --> 3:09:33.280]  informed about the Bill of Rights and Constitution and Ninth and Tenth Amendment versus Miss Teen
[3:09:33.280 --> 3:09:38.000]  South Carolina, who literally didn't even know what planet she was on will play that clip coming
[3:09:38.000 --> 3:09:42.240]  up later, but I didn't know I was watching controversy when I happened to, you know,
[3:09:42.240 --> 3:09:48.960]  watch 30 minutes of it that evening because I didn't continue to watch to see the final judging,
[3:09:49.600 --> 3:09:54.400]  and then I discovered, and the news reported she may have lost because she didn't answer that
[3:09:54.400 --> 3:10:00.960]  politically correct. You heard the judge, you know, ask about the Arizona lawn. He said,
[3:10:00.960 --> 3:10:05.840]  well, wait, don't boo yet. And then she got this big standing ovation that I would say was five,
[3:10:05.840 --> 3:10:12.400]  six, seven times louder than the booze, and we'll play it again coming up just to have it on record,
[3:10:12.400 --> 3:10:17.040]  that the people, you know, responded to state's rights. I mean, the government's too big. It's
[3:10:17.040 --> 3:10:21.360]  out of control. Mexico's collapsing, but, you know, she went on to say, like Ron Paul,
[3:10:21.360 --> 3:10:25.600]  Congressman said here yesterday, he is against racial profiling if it's misused,
[3:10:25.600 --> 3:10:29.680]  but that wasn't good enough. But to really pick her brain, because there's nothing like beauty
[3:10:29.680 --> 3:10:37.360]  and brains altogether, is Morgan Elizabeth Woolard, the runner up second place in Miss USA.
[3:10:37.360 --> 3:10:42.320]  Great to have you here with us. Thanks for coming on. Thank you very much. Thank you for having me.
[3:10:42.960 --> 3:10:49.200]  Again, Miss Oklahoma on the line with us. Well, I mean, let's go back to the pageant a week and
[3:10:49.200 --> 3:10:54.160]  a half ago. What happened there? Anything that happened behind the scenes? Break it down for us.
[3:10:54.160 --> 3:10:59.840]  The behind the scenes? Well, what do you mean? Were there two and a half weeks before the actual
[3:10:59.840 --> 3:11:06.240]  telecast? And so there are a lot of behind the scenes. Exactly. That's what I meant. I mean,
[3:11:06.240 --> 3:11:10.720]  because always sees the limited, I limited cuts. I mean, did somebody say something to you after
[3:11:10.720 --> 3:11:15.040]  you answered that way? Or did you ever get word like, ooh, that was a screw up? You should have
[3:11:15.040 --> 3:11:20.560]  called for world government? Or you should have called for us turning our guns in? Well, I mean,
[3:11:20.560 --> 3:11:25.520]  they don't speak to you at all afterward about, you know, how you answered your question. But I
[3:11:25.520 --> 3:11:31.520]  think afterward, of course, the media definitely brought that to my attention. And we're wondering
[3:11:31.520 --> 3:11:37.360]  simply from the scoring, you know, I was actually ahead the entire competition until then. And of
[3:11:37.360 --> 3:11:42.640]  course, having judges in the entertainment industry, which is predominantly liberal,
[3:11:42.640 --> 3:11:48.960]  they do question whether it hurt my chances or not. Yeah, that's a key statistics that Fox News
[3:11:48.960 --> 3:11:55.040]  did cover. And Miss Oklahoma named first runner up in Miss USA pageant after answering immigration
[3:11:55.040 --> 3:12:00.880]  questions. You were way ahead until that point. I mean, whether smoke, there's fire. And I don't,
[3:12:00.880 --> 3:12:05.280]  I mean, I talked to you earlier, you don't want to be somebody who's a sword loser. But if you were
[3:12:05.280 --> 3:12:09.600]  ahead and then suddenly you got behind that, I mean, that is suspicious.
[3:12:09.600 --> 3:12:19.440]  Yeah, I mean, I guess so. I think with me, I just kind of have to have a positive perspective. And,
[3:12:19.440 --> 3:12:23.600]  you know, when you work so hard for something, the last thing you want to think of is the way
[3:12:23.600 --> 3:12:29.680]  you answered your question is what did you in. And so I just choose not to flage light my mind
[3:12:29.680 --> 3:12:35.440]  with anything condemning like that and, you know, not be a sore loser or victimize myself, but rise
[3:12:35.440 --> 3:12:41.040]  above it and be happy for Rima and just move on to the next chapter of my life. Well, she is
[3:12:41.040 --> 3:12:46.000]  obviously intelligent and lovely as well. But I think you are the Claire winner. And again,
[3:12:46.000 --> 3:12:51.520]  the entire time, well, thank you, you were ahead until you didn't answer the thing politically
[3:12:51.520 --> 3:12:55.760]  correct. And you know, the issue is tell us about the rules, because I'm not an expert on this. In
[3:12:55.760 --> 3:13:01.760]  fact, I'm ignorant on this subject. I mean, is it political? Do the judges tell you if I don't
[3:13:01.760 --> 3:13:06.560]  agree with your politics? I'm going to vote against you because, because, you know, we need to know
[3:13:06.560 --> 3:13:10.880]  if it is rigged. I mean, I understand you don't want to go there, but this is quite an issue.
[3:13:12.960 --> 3:13:19.280]  Well, I don't think the USA system is quite as transparent with their judging criteria and
[3:13:19.840 --> 3:13:26.320]  how the whole process goes. But I believe once you get to the top five, or I think even through
[3:13:26.320 --> 3:13:33.920]  1510 to five, they raise the scores entirely and it starts all over again. And so once you do,
[3:13:33.920 --> 3:13:39.680]  make top five and answer a question, you have a final look and I believe they rank you after that.
[3:13:40.320 --> 3:13:44.960]  And so, you know, it could be they like to personality better. I don't know. I just,
[3:13:46.000 --> 3:13:51.760]  you know, all I can say is I did my best and I'm proud of my answer. I have no regrets. People
[3:13:51.760 --> 3:13:56.560]  ask me all the time if I would have voted differently. No, I do believe it's safe, right?
[3:13:56.560 --> 3:13:59.440]  Then I think I took a stance, but I did it diplomatically.
[3:14:00.800 --> 3:14:06.080]  Well, you certainly did a very diplomatic effect. You could be an ambassador for the US in the
[3:14:06.080 --> 3:14:13.280]  future. I mean, you answered it perfectly. Well, that was my hope of becoming a USA to be an ambassador
[3:14:13.280 --> 3:14:19.360]  for my country. But that just was not on the cards for me. And I was blessed to even compete
[3:14:19.360 --> 3:14:22.640]  for such a prestigious title. So first on our office, quite the honor.
[3:14:23.440 --> 3:14:27.760]  Well, you know, I'm really proud of you and so are my listeners. We got a lot of fan mail for
[3:14:27.760 --> 3:14:32.640]  you here at the office and people just calling in and emails just when we played the clip saying,
[3:14:32.640 --> 3:14:38.080]  wow, this is wonderful, especially in Oklahoma, your home state, where you are Miss Oklahoma,
[3:14:38.080 --> 3:14:43.200]  because people appreciated you not going with the politically correct answer. Because that's
[3:14:43.200 --> 3:14:48.560]  what really is valuable is telling the truth, standing up for what you believe in. And so,
[3:14:48.560 --> 3:14:52.560]  you know, that made you the winner overall when it came to defending this Republic.
[3:14:52.560 --> 3:14:57.760]  Thank you very much. Give us your take on states rights and the Arizona issue,
[3:14:57.760 --> 3:15:02.560]  because you only had a few seconds to talk about it then. Now you've got more time.
[3:15:03.200 --> 3:15:07.280]  Right. And that's what makes it even more difficult. I think, you know, this is such a
[3:15:07.280 --> 3:15:14.720]  hot-bun issue that is on our TVs, you know, 20 hours of the day, and I have 20 seconds to sum it up.
[3:15:14.720 --> 3:15:21.680]  That is not the easiest thing in the world. And I think I'd also like to clarify,
[3:15:21.680 --> 3:15:27.120]  which I don't think a lot of people realize, is they didn't ask me whether I was for or against
[3:15:27.120 --> 3:15:34.240]  the law. They asked me whether I felt it should be, you know, state or federal. And I firmly
[3:15:34.240 --> 3:15:39.600]  believe in states rights. I think a state should be allowed to mandate rules and regulations as
[3:15:39.600 --> 3:15:46.640]  they see fit. I love that we can put power in the hands of the people. And I fully support that.
[3:15:48.560 --> 3:15:53.920]  Well, on top of it, Napolitano, the head of Homeland Security last week in congressional
[3:15:53.920 --> 3:15:58.160]  testimony being questioned by John McCain, said, I haven't read the Arizona bill.
[3:16:00.160 --> 3:16:02.000]  Oh, you saw that? I did, yes.
[3:16:03.760 --> 3:16:07.360]  I mean, how can then she condemn it if she hasn't read it? Because I have read it. I've read it
[3:16:07.360 --> 3:16:12.880]  here on air. It is identical to the federal law. He hasn't read it as well, I believe.
[3:16:16.160 --> 3:16:21.440]  Who did you say hasn't read it? Attorney General Eric Holder? Yes, yes, you're right. He admits it.
[3:16:21.440 --> 3:16:26.320]  So, so, so what's your take on them commenting on something they haven't read?
[3:16:28.480 --> 3:16:33.680]  Well, I certainly think that's an issue. I think, you know, before you believe in something,
[3:16:33.680 --> 3:16:43.200]  you should know what all that bill entails and what is within it. So, I think that is certainly an
[3:16:43.200 --> 3:16:50.320]  issue. Wow. Well, listen, while you're here on air, we've got you till about 45 after we're
[3:16:50.320 --> 3:16:54.880]  appreciative of the time. Anything else you want to set the record straight on? We're talking to
[3:16:54.880 --> 3:17:01.120]  Miss Oklahoma. She got second place runner up in Miss USA. She was ahead the entire time until
[3:17:01.120 --> 3:17:10.000]  she didn't sell America out on national television. But again, she's being a good sport. And, you know,
[3:17:10.000 --> 3:17:14.960]  I guess she made the field goal, but they're taking it back. And so, I guess I'm going to say it's
[3:17:14.960 --> 3:17:19.840]  rigged, but she's a big sport and we appreciate that. But anything else you want to set the record
[3:17:19.840 --> 3:17:25.280]  straight about? Well, you know, if I think there was one thing that I could set the record straight
[3:17:25.280 --> 3:17:31.760]  with, it would just be that I'm one who does not want to victimize myself. I think a lot of promos
[3:17:31.760 --> 3:17:37.040]  in the media are saying, Miss Oklahoma lost her crown because of what she said. And, you know,
[3:17:37.040 --> 3:17:43.520]  truthfully, yes, it was a volatile question and it was doomed for a polarizing answer. But I really
[3:17:43.520 --> 3:17:50.560]  don't want to victimize myself. Miss USA wasn't a do-or-die situation for me. It would have been
[3:17:50.560 --> 3:17:57.920]  an incredible honor to represent the USA system and Donald Trump and my country. But, you know,
[3:17:57.920 --> 3:18:03.840]  that didn't work out for me. And being scholastically and professionally active, I know that I have
[3:18:03.840 --> 3:18:09.680]  great things coming in life regardless. And so, I just want people to know I'm not bitter. I am
[3:18:09.680 --> 3:18:13.680]  not a victim and that I'm going to do good things with my life regardless of the crown.
[3:18:14.480 --> 3:18:20.000]  Well, I honor that and I know my listeners do. So, you're being a great sport about it.
[3:18:20.000 --> 3:18:27.280]  But I want to be clear. I think people who do think that that question was wrong and do think
[3:18:27.280 --> 3:18:36.240]  that you were penalized, I think in future, the fans of Miss USA should put their input in
[3:18:36.240 --> 3:18:42.000]  about the transparency of the judging rules so that the young ladies know what they're going into.
[3:18:43.120 --> 3:18:43.360]  Right.
[3:18:45.120 --> 3:18:48.960]  Now, you're very young. I mean, you're in, what, a sophomore or junior in college?
[3:18:48.960 --> 3:18:51.200]  A junior in college. I'm 21 years old.
[3:18:51.200 --> 3:18:55.200]  And so, you can continue to be part of pageants. This isn't your last rodeo.
[3:18:55.200 --> 3:19:02.960]  Well, yes and no. The USA system, it goes on to Miss Universe. And because of that,
[3:19:03.680 --> 3:19:10.000]  the most prestigious pageant in the world. And so, I've kind of already competed as far up as I
[3:19:10.000 --> 3:19:16.320]  can go. And so, if I wanted to compete, there are other systems. There's Miss World, there's Miss
[3:19:16.320 --> 3:19:22.000]  International and of course, Miss America, who has the talent portion. And so, you know,
[3:19:22.000 --> 3:19:29.120]  I'm open-minded to that. But I think at this point in my life, I'm ready to move on and pursue my
[3:19:29.120 --> 3:19:34.880]  career and finish my education and that kind of thing. I don't completely shut it out. But
[3:19:34.880 --> 3:19:37.920]  at this moment in time, I don't think I'll be competing anymore.
[3:19:37.920 --> 3:19:41.280]  Well, that's great. I mean, you're very well-balanced. You've got a larger universe out
[3:19:41.280 --> 3:19:46.800]  there than just these beauty pageants. But it is great to have Miss Oklahoma with us.
[3:19:46.800 --> 3:19:52.480]  We'll talk about her worldview and what she's planning in her career next.
[3:19:52.480 --> 3:19:54.000]  When we get back, stay with us.
[3:19:55.200 --> 3:20:00.160]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[3:20:00.160 --> 3:20:03.600]  What have we got? A republic or a monarchy?
[3:20:03.600 --> 3:20:07.280]  A republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[3:20:07.280 --> 3:20:11.520]  Not democracy, not mob rule, two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[3:20:11.520 --> 3:20:17.120]  So they think they own our land, they think they own our water, children, our education, our money.
[3:20:17.120 --> 3:20:21.120]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[3:20:21.120 --> 3:20:24.800]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot uprising.
[3:20:24.800 --> 3:20:26.080]  You have been warned.
[3:20:26.080 --> 3:20:29.840]  We have the facts. We have the Constitution. We have the Bill of Rights. We have common
[3:20:29.840 --> 3:20:34.480]  law. Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen. And I'm so excited to be able to offer you.
[3:20:34.480 --> 3:20:39.440]  Don't tread on me. Rise of the Republic. Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant
[3:20:39.440 --> 3:20:42.960]  that is the American people is rising. A new tool in the Info War.

[3:21:55.040 --> 3:21:59.200]  Are you tired of out-of-control, irresponsible federal deficit spending?
[3:21:59.200 --> 3:22:03.440]  Increasing the money supply without increasing productive output leads to inflation.
[3:22:03.440 --> 3:22:07.600]  You get less for your money. If you want to protect the buying power of dollars for your
[3:22:07.600 --> 3:22:15.840]  future, then call Peter May at Midas Resources 800-686-2237 extension 135.
[3:22:15.840 --> 3:22:19.360]  You've worked hard for your dollars. Don't let the government strip their buying power
[3:22:19.360 --> 3:22:23.920]  with wasteful spending. Gold has a 5,000-year track record as money.
[3:22:23.920 --> 3:22:28.320]  Real money you can count on. No government-backed paper currency comes close.

[3:22:36.880 --> 3:22:41.760]  extension 135. Central banks from around the world are stockpiling gold.

[3:22:51.120 --> 3:22:54.400]  to discover the advantages of private protected gold.
[3:22:55.680 --> 3:23:00.240]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle
[3:23:00.240 --> 3:23:04.080]  and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[3:23:04.080 --> 3:23:09.360]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[3:23:09.360 --> 3:23:13.440]  Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it?
[3:23:13.440 --> 3:23:17.680]  Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper
[3:23:17.680 --> 3:23:22.640]  identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine
[3:23:22.640 --> 3:23:26.720]  and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[3:23:26.720 --> 3:23:30.320]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[3:23:30.320 --> 3:23:34.080]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[3:23:34.080 --> 3:23:38.240]  How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get.
[3:23:38.240 --> 3:23:46.640]  I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633
[3:23:46.640 --> 3:23:53.920]  or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com. Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[3:23:56.880 --> 3:24:01.520]  Recent polls have shown a fifth of Americans can't locate the U.S. on a world map.
[3:24:01.520 --> 3:24:10.640]  Why do you think this is? I personally believe that U.S. Americans are unable to do so
[3:24:11.360 --> 3:24:20.080]  because some people out there in our nation don't have maps and I believe that our education like
[3:24:20.080 --> 3:24:27.600]  such as South Africa and Iraq everywhere like such as and I believe that they should
[3:24:27.600 --> 3:24:34.480]  our education over here in the U.S. should help the U.S. or should help South Africa
[3:24:34.480 --> 3:24:39.600]  and should help the Iraq and the Asian countries so we will be able to build up our future.
[3:24:41.920 --> 3:24:49.520]  Thank you, Ms. South Carolina. It is refreshing to have Ms. Oklahoma on with us and run her up for
[3:24:49.520 --> 3:24:58.480]  Miss USA to have someone who is very intelligent because my experience is beautiful women are
[3:24:58.480 --> 3:25:03.040]  just as smart as you know on average as other intelligent women but I don't want you to say
[3:25:03.040 --> 3:25:08.880]  mean things here but what was your take on Miss Teen South Carolina and that big controversy a few
[3:25:08.880 --> 3:25:20.800]  years ago? Well you know I'm not one to to judge anyone so all I can say is God bless her and it's
[3:25:20.800 --> 3:25:27.200]  you know it's not easy being up there for the millions of people and lights in your face you
[3:25:27.200 --> 3:25:32.160]  know and possibly becoming a potential YouTube moment is a lot going through your brain so you
[3:25:32.160 --> 3:25:37.600]  got to give her some credit for at least putting yourself out there and you know doing her best
[3:25:37.600 --> 3:25:44.000]  right hey at least she got in the arena I'm just saying comparing her to you it is it is night and
[3:25:44.000 --> 3:25:51.360]  day uh now uh talking during the break I brought up uh Kerry Prejanov I'm pronouncing that right
[3:25:51.360 --> 3:25:56.960]  I vaguely remember last year the big controversy where she you know said my parents brought me up
[3:25:56.960 --> 3:26:02.480]  to be you know pro uh you know family and and marriage is a institution that that that deals
[3:26:02.480 --> 3:26:07.760]  with that and you said well I get asked about a lot of that and you told me privately your views on it
[3:26:07.760 --> 3:26:16.000]  and but it's such a hot issue uh so so putting it as nicely as you can uh I mean you were explaining
[3:26:16.000 --> 3:26:21.200]  the parallel of even if you basically were dissed for answering the question the way you were you
[3:26:21.200 --> 3:26:28.080]  don't want to be seen as as as basically running with it or milking it right well you know I think
[3:26:28.080 --> 3:26:34.880]  a lot of people have been comparing me to Kerry Prejon or saying I'm the next Kerry Prejon because
[3:26:34.880 --> 3:26:39.920]  it is kind of ironic you know she gets the gay marriage question I get the legal immigration
[3:26:39.920 --> 3:26:46.080]  question we both gave fairly conservative answers that are pretty blonde then end up first interrupt
[3:26:46.080 --> 3:26:53.840]  right um so there are definitely some comparisons there but I just didn't want to victimize myself
[3:26:53.840 --> 3:27:02.560]  I felt she kind of melts her time in the media just for being controversial and um I just didn't
[3:27:02.560 --> 3:27:08.720]  want people to view me as the same or victimize me or anything along those lines if that makes sense
[3:27:09.360 --> 3:27:15.360]  but I mean every year now it's about politics people losing who are the runner-ups because
[3:27:15.360 --> 3:27:21.040]  they have conservative or or constitutional or traditional values I think Donald Trump needs
[3:27:21.040 --> 3:27:25.680]  to get the politics out of this because the message to people is you know if you don't have the right
[3:27:25.680 --> 3:27:31.760]  political view it's not how talented or how beautiful or how dynamic you are you know this is
[3:27:31.760 --> 3:27:36.880]  political correctness and I think and I frankly I think it was political correctness I mean I think
[3:27:36.880 --> 3:27:42.400]  the Lebanese woman is bombshell beautiful but I I don't think she was in the top five I mean
[3:27:43.200 --> 3:27:47.360]  I happened to again just catch about 20 minutes of it was pure torture of course I was drinking
[3:27:47.360 --> 3:27:54.560]  coffee after my Sunday show but I mean I'm sorry I don't think she's second place I saw you out
[3:27:54.560 --> 3:27:59.360]  there on that runway and and let me tell you it was like my eyes were on springs I hope my wife's
[3:27:59.360 --> 3:28:05.280]  not listening I'm sorry but no I mean seriously I mean I thought you were the most beautiful you
[3:28:05.280 --> 3:28:10.240]  popped out there that's the reason you were in the leadership role and if you'd have said I'm against
[3:28:10.240 --> 3:28:15.760]  Arizona I love open borders I love world government I love I love crime that they would have been
[3:28:15.760 --> 3:28:22.800]  bong bong bong you jackpot you're the winner I'm sorry they stole it from you you know again I
[3:28:22.800 --> 3:28:28.640]  I would hope not that's not the case but you're actually correct actually Rima while she is
[3:28:29.200 --> 3:28:35.520]  stunningly beautiful if you average something evening down I think she was actually in seventh
[3:28:35.520 --> 3:28:43.040]  place and so um you know winning I'm I'm so proud of her and I think it's awesome that she's Arab
[3:28:43.040 --> 3:28:49.440]  American I think that's you know a great neat thing for our country but it is a little disappointing
[3:28:49.440 --> 3:28:58.480]  for me you know when you want something so badly and so close but so far but again I'm I'm doing okay
[3:28:58.480 --> 3:29:04.480]  I'm not better and I'm just excited for what's next in my life I know but there you are though see
[3:29:04.480 --> 3:29:10.000]  see you just backed that up with statistics she was in seventh place she was way back there she
[3:29:10.000 --> 3:29:14.240]  wasn't in you know it's like a NASCAR race you got two or three of the top drivers you know they're
[3:29:14.240 --> 3:29:18.960]  up there on the last lap and then all of a sudden you answered that question wrong and your engine
[3:29:18.960 --> 3:29:26.320]  blew up and then you know seventh place goes nyer on nyer on nyer on nyer on I mean come on come on
[3:29:26.320 --> 3:29:40.160]  baby rima honestly she's got the funniest guzia's personality and I really think she just won him over in her interview because she's just such a relatable uh
[3:29:41.200 --> 3:29:48.240]  uh miss oklahoma stay there one more segment with you we're on the march the empire's on the run

[3:33:17.520 --> 3:33:22.640]  hit on the financial front with world markets collapsing all over the place in the last segment
[3:33:22.640 --> 3:33:30.080]  today again thank you for joining us radio listeners i want to go to calls but i also want to talk
[3:33:30.080 --> 3:33:34.720]  about you in the future i mean you're intelligent you're smart you're constitutionalist you're for
[3:33:34.720 --> 3:33:40.000]  states rights you've been punished for standing up for your rights even if you won't stand up for
[3:33:40.000 --> 3:33:43.760]  yourself but i think that's you know in a way admirable that that you're not being you know a
[3:33:43.760 --> 3:33:50.880]  spoilsport but it's not a spoilsport if you were cheated but again discretion is the you know
[3:33:50.880 --> 3:33:55.360]  greater valor i guess they say but but where are you planning to go from here i was telling you
[3:33:55.360 --> 3:34:01.440]  during the break you ought to write a book about this and interweave in there your political views
[3:34:04.240 --> 3:34:11.600]  well that's a loaded question oh my goodness so much to say there i have been incredibly blessed
[3:34:11.600 --> 3:34:19.840]  with being given numerous options from here you know the missus a pageant this exposure itself is
[3:34:19.840 --> 3:34:25.840]  a blessing especially if you want to be in the media and so i'm very thankful for all the opportunities
[3:34:25.840 --> 3:34:31.280]  that have come my way because of this pageant um i'm already getting offers you know within the
[3:34:31.280 --> 3:34:37.600]  broadcasting world modeling world acting world hosting anything of that nature so i think right
[3:34:37.600 --> 3:34:43.760]  now i just need to decide what's best for me in my future and take a risk and go a direction and
[3:34:43.760 --> 3:34:49.440]  they also need to finish my education as well i'm getting close but not quite there yet so hopefully
[3:34:49.440 --> 3:34:56.400]  i can find a way to pursue finishing my education and starting my career at the same time well let
[3:34:56.400 --> 3:35:02.480]  me just just just inject this there's a lot of anchors on on television like peter jennings that
[3:35:02.480 --> 3:35:07.440]  that you know that don't have degrees and i would strike while the iron's hot you can always go back
[3:35:07.440 --> 3:35:12.640]  to college but right now you're smart you're talented you're well spoken uh you're beautiful i
[3:35:12.640 --> 3:35:17.600]  would get into the media and i would take every opportunity you've got right now because i'm not
[3:35:17.600 --> 3:35:23.200]  bashing college and education that's fine and dandy uh it's just that bill gates rush limbaugh
[3:35:23.920 --> 3:35:29.600]  if you look at the statistics over 90 percent of the top ceo's media people you name it didn't go
[3:35:29.600 --> 3:35:34.480]  to college or quit college because they were already go-getters by 20 years old halfway into
[3:35:34.480 --> 3:35:38.960]  college they already had opportunities same thing with me i was 21 i had about another year and a
[3:35:38.960 --> 3:35:44.960]  half of college left i'd already gone and gotten a radio show locally and i was sayonara but but
[3:35:44.960 --> 3:35:48.960]  again i'm just saying strike while the iron's hot strike while you're in the spotlight because you
[3:35:48.960 --> 3:35:54.240]  could argue due to that controversial question and your controversial answer for some you almost
[3:35:54.240 --> 3:35:59.360]  got more attention than the lady that won miss usa so at the end of the day it doesn't matter if they
[3:35:59.360 --> 3:36:05.440]  stole the crown from you because you still win yes you know it really is a win-win situation
[3:36:06.080 --> 3:36:10.640]  i'm incredibly blessed and i'm again so grateful for all these opportunities
[3:36:12.800 --> 3:36:17.920]  so you're getting a lot of offers right now acting tv you name it just dive in with both feet name
[3:36:17.920 --> 3:36:23.760]  it now you know i think the hardest part is just figuring out which route to take because of course
[3:36:23.760 --> 3:36:29.920]  you want to do it best for you want to do it best for your future and um take the bull by the horn
[3:36:29.920 --> 3:36:35.280]  and you know make the right decision and i think that's the the place i'm in at the moment well
[3:36:35.280 --> 3:36:41.520]  let me give you some advice don't sign anything try a lot of different things uh because hollywood
[3:36:41.520 --> 3:36:46.960]  tv it's full of a lot of flim flammers a lot of talkers uh but just you know i would go with the
[3:36:46.960 --> 3:36:52.720]  big companies or established companies uh who can give you bona fide money at the you know at the
[3:36:52.720 --> 3:36:56.560]  bottom because they'll sit there and string you along to see where your career is going
[3:36:56.560 --> 3:37:01.280]  you know uh so i mean again i would just hit the ground running and try a lot of things out
[3:37:01.280 --> 3:37:06.160]  and that's why i'm warning you because most people won't do this college especially when
[3:37:06.160 --> 3:37:11.920]  you're already being launched and propelled uh you you can always go back into the college you
[3:37:11.920 --> 3:37:18.080]  can't always get this advantage you've got right now you can't always get the present back right
[3:37:18.080 --> 3:37:24.160]  and that's you know that's kind of another position i'm in in regards to being in between a rock and
[3:37:24.160 --> 3:37:31.760]  a hard play because both of my parents are within the medical field and they're all about education
[3:37:31.760 --> 3:37:39.200]  education education and so um for me i just need to find a place or relocate to a place that i can
[3:37:39.200 --> 3:37:44.560]  pursue both at once that's the way to do it completely that you need to take advantage of
[3:37:44.560 --> 3:37:49.920]  things while they're hot and you know when they're in front of you you gotta grab them otherwise life
[3:37:49.920 --> 3:37:56.960]  might you know pass you by so when things are hot in front of you you gotta grab them that's a good
[3:37:56.960 --> 3:38:07.760]  quote from miss oklahoma absolutely yeah so you you could go to chicago new york la places like that
[3:38:07.760 --> 3:38:17.760]  and uh sorry go ahead oh i was just agreeing well listen to big city absolutely well i before we go
[3:38:17.760 --> 3:38:24.160]  to eric christ mike and others with miss oklahoma the patriot uh who we just love to death give us
[3:38:25.120 --> 3:38:29.440]  some of your other views on the second amendment or on have you have you heard all these world
[3:38:29.440 --> 3:38:33.760]  leaders calling for global government and that we need to have the private central banks running
[3:38:33.760 --> 3:38:42.080]  things what's your view on ron paul i think ron paul is a wonderful man and i agree with him on a lot
[3:38:42.080 --> 3:38:47.600]  of stances i'm i've always been a bit of a constitutionalist myself and i believe in limited
[3:38:47.600 --> 3:38:54.400]  governments and liberty and rule of law and all those wonderful things in america self-government
[3:38:54.400 --> 3:39:03.840]  self-government that kind of thing well that's wonderful uh again while we've got you here uh where
[3:39:03.840 --> 3:39:08.320]  would you like to see our republic going i mean or you can have you heard them talk on the news
[3:39:08.320 --> 3:39:15.680]  about forming this world government um world government do you by that you mean giving
[3:39:15.680 --> 3:39:20.080]  the government more power well you've got bandkai moon the secretary general of the u in herman
[3:39:20.080 --> 3:39:25.840]  von ruby the head of the u the outgoing prime minister of england uh gordon brown al gore uh
[3:39:25.840 --> 3:39:32.640]  the heads of the g20 are calling for a global government to set worldwide taxes uh and i was
[3:39:32.640 --> 3:39:38.080]  just asking if you were concerned about that i'm definitely concerned about that i've always been
[3:39:38.880 --> 3:39:45.360]  for limited governments and um being able to be your own keeper and having self-government and
[3:39:45.360 --> 3:39:49.760]  you know making something of yourself and not relying too much on the government for that
[3:39:49.760 --> 3:39:59.440]  and so i'm definitely against the government in the world well i tell you i wish you were miss
[3:39:59.440 --> 3:40:05.280]  usas somebody to really represent our country but you are representing our country and and people

[3:40:15.920 --> 3:40:20.800]  correct answer he's gonna like that or are you just such a patriot that there wasn't even a question
[3:40:22.000 --> 3:40:28.800]  well truthfully in that moment and time you don't have time to think you just go with what you know

[3:40:35.920 --> 3:40:41.200]  easy for me to answer i didn't have to think twice about it because that's who i am and that's how
[3:40:41.200 --> 3:40:48.640]  it's raised and you know i i said firmament well that's why people admire you not just for your

[3:42:34.640 --> 3:42:41.360]  21 in college what is um your opinion or what are you seeing as far as the like increased police
[3:42:41.360 --> 3:42:47.920]  state and the the loss the erosion of our rights now what do you think of the patriot act being
[3:42:47.920 --> 3:42:53.280]  used against us citizens uh they've got legislation introduced where citizens can be secretly arrested
[3:42:53.280 --> 3:42:58.560]  uh we're seeing in universities i don't know about oklahoma but more and more censorship
[3:42:58.560 --> 3:43:04.080]  of libertarian or conservative political viewpoints thanks for the call chris let's get
[3:43:04.080 --> 3:43:08.880]  her take on that question i'm sorry what exactly are you asking me well i mean what do you think
[3:43:08.880 --> 3:43:14.160]  about the loss of liberty the the erosion of the bill of rights warrantless wiretapping
[3:43:14.800 --> 3:43:20.000]  are you concerned about that well i think that kind of goes along with what we were
[3:43:20.000 --> 3:43:25.360]  speaking about earlier it's given government too much power and you know i i don't want our
[3:43:25.360 --> 3:43:30.000]  freedoms to be taken away i don't want our liberties to be taken away i think those things
[3:43:30.960 --> 3:43:37.920]  is exactly what makes america america and just being able to govern yourself and you know not
[3:43:37.920 --> 3:43:43.360]  having like i said the government controlling too many aspects of our lives i definitely think
[3:43:43.360 --> 3:43:50.560]  there's a point where they need to step back and give us our freedom again absolutely we've got
[3:43:50.560 --> 3:43:55.360]  to step up and take them back absolutely did you hear the debate with lew dobs and others about
[3:43:55.360 --> 3:44:02.080]  the north american union spp nap to superhighways all these toll roads going in that that uh the money
[3:44:02.080 --> 3:44:07.200]  then goes to foreign corporations in spain and europe i mean a have you heard of that be what's
[3:44:07.200 --> 3:44:15.200]  your take on it i've not heard too much about that to be honest especially if it's recent being in
[3:44:15.200 --> 3:44:21.920]  vegas from us for three weeks we kind of live in a fishbowl i haven't been able to be watching the
[3:44:21.920 --> 3:44:29.520]  news as often as i normally do but as far as foreign nations go i do think we need to become less

[3:45:44.640 --> 3:45:49.920]  forward to uh you know after you've gotten into your career uh getting hitched and uh and having
[3:45:49.920 --> 3:45:57.200]  some kids oh absolutely i'm a big believer in family and i'm looking forward to that day i don't
[3:45:57.200 --> 3:46:02.720]  know when that day will be but i definitely am someone who wants to have wonderful family and
[3:46:02.720 --> 3:46:10.240]  children and you know i'm just a great american family well it's been great having you here and
[3:46:10.240 --> 3:46:17.440]  we appreciate your courage did we ever find that clip guys of uh carrie pijon or prejon however you
[3:46:17.440 --> 3:46:21.840]  pronounce it we didn't find that because i heard it all over the news last year whenever she uh
[3:46:21.840 --> 3:46:28.800]  i mean you probably used to youtube but carrie prejon's uh gay marriage comment uh i mean you're
[3:46:28.800 --> 3:46:32.720]  quite a person because you're out there in the spotlight as a model and there's somebody who
[3:46:32.720 --> 3:46:38.320]  wanted to win who was going to win until that question came up the evidence is clear but then
[3:46:38.320 --> 3:46:45.040]  now clearly i think you were cheated but you want to be a good sport and you're saying no uh you know
[3:46:45.040 --> 3:46:49.760]  i don't want to get attention by going out and screaming bloody murder correct you're exactly
[3:46:49.760 --> 3:46:57.680]  right uh i mean are you critical of the lady who uh did uh a milk at somewhat
[3:46:59.760 --> 3:47:08.960]  well for me i think um i wouldn't think critical definitely not of her answer this is america
[3:47:08.960 --> 3:47:16.000]  and then the first amendment we have freedom of speech and so she had every right to speak her
[3:47:16.000 --> 3:47:24.960]  belief um and so i back her up fully with that in mind but i do feel that she kind of took it
[3:47:24.960 --> 3:47:31.760]  and ran with it and kind of overexposed herself to the media i guess and may have put a bad taste
[3:47:31.760 --> 3:47:38.800]  in people's mouth yeah maybe so so so your your problem isn't what she said not at all it's the
[3:47:38.800 --> 3:47:45.440]  fact that she did say i was cheated i was cheated exactly i think yeah i think you should um be
[3:47:45.440 --> 3:47:52.400]  humble and in your loss and you know just realize that everything happens for a reason and as as
[3:47:52.400 --> 3:47:58.080]  much as it seems sometimes just to know that greater things are in store and and just look
[3:47:58.080 --> 3:48:05.360]  forward to what god has next for your life absolutely it's all in god's hands well um
[3:48:05.360 --> 3:48:10.640]  we appreciate you uh joining us we've got about a minute left anything else that you forgot to add
[3:48:10.640 --> 3:48:18.560]  i don't think so just you know how grateful i am for the overwhelming support i've received
[3:48:18.560 --> 3:48:24.160]  everyone has been absolutely incredible not just from the state of oklahoma but my entire
[3:48:24.160 --> 3:48:29.200]  country and even people all over the world just showered with love and support and
[3:48:29.760 --> 3:48:35.520]  people backing me up from all over the place and so i'm so grateful and i really am just
[3:48:35.520 --> 3:48:42.240]  honored and humbled well that is my final question um going back you know you hear on the video the
[3:48:42.240 --> 3:48:48.480]  audio and it sounded like five six seven times the cheering that there was the booing you could
[3:48:48.480 --> 3:48:55.680]  barely hear the booing uh but you were there i mean was the cheering for you uh a lot more
[3:48:55.680 --> 3:49:03.120]  overwhelming than the booing oh without a doubt i think it tripled the booing as soon as i said i'm
[3:49:03.120 --> 3:49:09.840]  from believer in stryce and i love that about my country everyone just overflowed with you know
[3:49:09.840 --> 3:49:15.760]  clapping and cheering and i think the majority of the people there were in agreement with me on that
[3:49:15.760 --> 3:49:24.400]  statement well all i can say is incredible and it has been great uh having uh you on the broadcast
[3:49:24.400 --> 3:49:29.440]  and i know that um there's quite a few websites that have your info up but uh i'm not going to try

[3:54:45.440 --> 3:54:53.520]  europe another key article ron paul inside source told me fed is panicking at mass awakenings gcm
[3:54:53.520 --> 3:54:57.760]  live.com paul what's an article ron paul on with this yesterday and watch both those videos
[3:54:57.760 --> 3:55:02.720]  at gcm live.com i interview with ron paul so the so the good news is we're identifying the enemy
[3:55:02.720 --> 3:55:06.560]  they know we're aware of what they're doing but they're just imploding the entire economy what
[3:55:06.560 --> 3:55:10.880]  did dr paul craig roberts former head of the treasury wall street journal editor father
[3:55:10.880 --> 3:55:16.960]  reaganomics he said evil has been turned loose the government is completely evil you got a few
[3:55:16.960 --> 3:55:22.080]  good people in the government but the system is run by evil and look you wake up to that or it's over
[3:55:22.080 --> 3:55:27.840]  now i'm not going to tackle in back and the whole media frenzy about what he sells gold for
[3:55:28.480 --> 3:55:33.600]  because some of that stuff is collectible and it's good to have a mix but non-collectible
[3:55:33.600 --> 3:55:41.360]  semi numismatic the news reported 360 dollars for a frank and that was three months ago when when uh
[3:55:41.360 --> 3:55:47.040]  you know the gold was down about like a hundred bucks ted has frank said a hundred and i mean
[3:55:47.040 --> 3:55:51.760]  250 something it's like a hundred bucks less than what you know big gold companies are selling it
[3:55:51.760 --> 3:55:56.480]  because he bought it when it was lower he's selling it to you when it's higher at the low price so
[3:55:56.480 --> 3:56:01.440]  when i tell you that i get the daily sheets on this when you do a gold offer he's making three or
[3:56:01.440 --> 3:56:06.960]  four maybe five dollars different days on these francs on these sovereigns maybe six dollars
[3:56:06.960 --> 3:56:12.880]  that are quarter rounds and that's at the old amount when he bought it when it was low he's
[3:56:12.880 --> 3:56:18.240]  still selling it to you you cannot get better deals from my research maybe they're there uh you know
[3:56:18.240 --> 3:56:22.400]  maybe a leprechaun's got a golden pot or something but ted i wanted to bring you up briefly with a
[3:56:22.400 --> 3:56:27.360]  few news headlines on the economy and then not just the francs that everybody else is selling
[3:56:27.360 --> 3:56:32.400]  for over 300 you got them for 250 something but not for long because they are selling out gold
[3:56:32.400 --> 3:56:38.640]  way up today tell folks about the coins the offers the toll free number because i believe in this i
[3:56:38.640 --> 3:56:44.160]  buy my gold from you because you've got the best deals that normally people pay a little more with
[3:56:44.160 --> 3:56:48.320]  you it's still a great deal these specials on this show you got to tell them when you call
[3:56:48.320 --> 3:56:54.320]  alihandro jones that's me sent you ted anderson yeah i'm with you right here alex i can tell you
[3:56:54.320 --> 3:56:58.960]  right now british sovereigns i had to stop issuing them i can't sell them right now
[3:56:58.960 --> 3:57:04.320]  because my european sources can't get them to me because the europeans the europeans are buying
[3:57:04.320 --> 3:57:09.200]  them all up it's there's not enough supply right now for me to be able to say i have those but the
[3:57:09.200 --> 3:57:15.440]  francs are available and i still have them at 256 68 and i still am buying a full year subscription
[3:57:15.440 --> 3:57:21.360]  to the international forecaster if you only buy one i need to say it right now i mean gold is up
[3:57:21.360 --> 3:57:26.400]  everything's strong the europeans are buying gold they typically don't do it they're they're not
[3:57:26.400 --> 3:57:34.640]  they're not the kind of people that buy gold they people are screwballs you cannot 250 something
[3:57:34.640 --> 3:57:40.080]  bucks for a fifth of an ounce gold coin uh that's got the numismatic you know some collector value
[3:57:40.080 --> 3:57:46.080]  not a lot the point is that's that that's bullion or below bullion because and ted you are running
[3:57:46.080 --> 3:57:56.080]  out you're out of the sovereigns i didn't know that 800 686 2237 800 686 2237 don't screw around folks
