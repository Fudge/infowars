[02:16.720 --> 02:23.360]  charges of premeditated murder stemming from last week shooting at Fort Hood post in Texas so
[02:23.360 --> 02:29.360]  you know I guess he's to be charged one week after the massacre speaking of this massacre
[02:29.360 --> 02:34.320]  and how it appears to be staged at some level whether he was whacked out on prozac or one of those
[02:34.320 --> 02:41.040]  serotonin reuptake inhibitors whether he was a patsy or whether he was a true Muslim extremist
[02:41.040 --> 02:47.200]  that the FBI and CIA knew was going to attack and allowed to do it any way you slice it they're caught
[02:47.200 --> 02:58.000]  red-handed that dovetails in with all of these mainstream news articles I mean there have been
[02:58.000 --> 03:04.240]  so many in the last week I meant to call a bunch of them this morning that I've seen I've seen a
[03:04.240 --> 03:11.200]  pattern emerge in mainstream news where how the US is funding the Taliban Taliban and Al Qaeda caught
[03:11.200 --> 03:18.160]  with us arms Taliban and Al Qaeda released when Afghan army captures them and the whole history
[03:18.160 --> 03:26.560]  of this but just lately it's all coming out just like it's coming out mainstream news that our
[03:26.560 --> 03:31.840]  government's growing the opium in Afghanistan and the cocaine in Colombia and only eradicating the
[03:31.840 --> 03:41.920]  minority growers the FARC communist in Colombia and some of the different Pashtun tribal leaders
[03:41.920 --> 03:47.920]  in Afghanistan I mean it's incredible how it can be an open secret that our criminal government
[03:47.920 --> 03:52.880]  brings most the drugs in it's an open secret they're setting up world government it's an open
[03:52.880 --> 03:58.320]  secret they've bankrupted the economy by design and are bringing in a world government a financial
[03:58.320 --> 04:04.000]  tyranny run by them it's a open secret they're eugenicists that want to forcibly reduce world
[04:04.000 --> 04:17.200]  population and still the drumbeat marches on also a new york hostage taker at a school as a
[04:17.200 --> 04:24.720]  disgruntled father of a vet gee i wonder where you got the idea from that i've seen several

[04:30.480 --> 04:36.160]  case is go take over schools and hospitals and hold kids hostage and they're somehow heroes i
[04:36.160 --> 04:43.520]  guarantee you this tv head got the idea from that it's disgusting another form of mind control

[08:20.480 --> 08:26.720]  november 2009 we are now into the second segment thank you so much for joining us all wants and
[08:26.720 --> 08:34.160]  will be on in the second half of the next hour joining us from england prisonplanet.com editor
[08:35.840 --> 08:43.040]  because i've seen a major pattern of mainstream media articles in the last few weeks admitting
[08:43.040 --> 08:50.320]  that the cia is protecting with our military forces the opium fields the poppy fields of
[08:50.320 --> 08:56.640]  afghanistan where upwards of 90 percent i i kept saying 80 percent of world opium was produced
[08:56.640 --> 09:02.080]  there but i guess that was a number from a few years ago i looked it up last night and they're
[09:02.080 --> 09:09.600]  saying it's estimated 90 to 92 percent the point is most the opium gets grown in afghanistan the
[09:09.600 --> 09:16.640]  climate is just perfect for it that's where uh many types of poppies that have the opiates in them
[09:17.280 --> 09:28.880]  are indigenous and the taliban a true faction of taliban that was not cia controlled
[09:30.160 --> 09:35.520]  took over afghanistan remember the taliban and al-qaeda were created in the late 1970s
[09:35.520 --> 09:40.560]  by the big new brazinski national security advisor to jimmy carter how do we know this he
[09:40.560 --> 09:43.920]  wrote two books about it bragging i mean we already knew this but now he admits that he's
[09:43.920 --> 09:52.480]  written a couple books the last few years and he brags and says look we had the muslim extremists
[09:53.040 --> 10:01.040]  attack the russian embassies attack the russian puppet government the remnant of it is that what
[10:01.040 --> 10:09.040]  we know as the northern alliance they're communist basically and you know them because they have the
[10:09.040 --> 10:14.800]  short beards and the regular taliban have the long beards i mean it's literally that that uh
[10:14.800 --> 10:20.240]  obvious uh they're in afghanistan and of course you have the patch tunes that make up a lot of the
[10:20.240 --> 10:24.640]  taliban and there's different subgroups of the patch tunes and there's several other groups
[10:24.640 --> 10:30.160]  and they're always constantly killing each other that's why no one can conquer afghanistan because
[10:30.160 --> 10:37.840]  they're a bunch of hillbillies and i'm a little bit of a hillbilly i'm not knocking them for that
[10:37.840 --> 10:41.200]  they're a bunch of hillbillies that have been killing each other for thousands of years and
[10:41.200 --> 10:44.720]  they're never going to stop killing each other and if you get in the middle of them killing
[10:44.720 --> 10:49.760]  each other and fighting with each other it's a warrior society it's like the native americans
[10:49.760 --> 10:55.040]  they were constantly attacking their neighboring tribes and constantly taking over different
[10:55.040 --> 11:02.400]  areas that's why they were so easy to beat was because you could buy one native tribe off and
[11:02.400 --> 11:06.560]  leverage them against the next tribe you wanted to take over in fact the natives would come to
[11:06.560 --> 11:12.320]  the westerners to the french and british and german and dutch and spanish settlers and say hey
[11:12.320 --> 11:17.680]  we want you to come attack our neighbor and share their land with us the difference with the afghans
[11:17.680 --> 11:26.000]  is they have modern weapons and there are not as many factions in afghanistan as there are here
[11:26.880 --> 11:32.960]  as there were in north america into central and south america it was the same story literally
[11:32.960 --> 11:37.920]  hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of different tribes that were all very different in many
[11:37.920 --> 11:42.160]  respects i don't want to get into anthropology here i don't claim to be a expert on it even a
[11:42.160 --> 11:47.760]  lay expert but i've studied it quite a bit and how that was used against them but with the
[11:48.800 --> 11:55.200]  with the afghans they are muslims and whereas they do like to kill each other they particularly like
[11:55.200 --> 12:04.320]  to kill the greeks when they invaded over 2 000 years ago they like to kill the persians when
[12:04.320 --> 12:09.600]  they invaded that's the iranians today they like to kill the british when they invade they like to
[12:09.600 --> 12:14.560]  kill pakistanis when they invade they like to kill indians when they invade they like to kill
[12:14.560 --> 12:19.760]  the chinese when they've invaded they like to kill the russians when they invade you come there
[12:19.760 --> 12:24.160]  and you occupy their country and start bossing them around they don't care if you kill them they're
[12:24.160 --> 12:27.920]  going to try to kill you it's very hard to beat somebody like that
[12:30.960 --> 12:36.640]  i mean the british tried to defeat the colonists who had been british subjects but once they decided
[12:36.640 --> 12:40.400]  they were going to fight and weren't going to stop it didn't matter if the war lasted seven years
[12:40.400 --> 12:47.200]  didn't matter if the colonies lost almost every battle more than nine out of ten i mean i mean
[12:47.200 --> 12:52.720]  they lost i haven't done the math but there was only a few major battles that they won starting
[12:52.720 --> 12:59.280]  at trinton new jersey i mean you can count the victories on one hand but they persevered you
[12:59.280 --> 13:06.880]  cannot beat them you'd have to kill every single afghan in the country you know the romans had
[13:06.880 --> 13:11.040]  trouble a few times with different groups they couldn't conquer and when they finally conquered
[13:11.040 --> 13:15.600]  them they would just kill everyone orders were given in certain cities
[13:17.680 --> 13:21.600]  well in the case of carthage just to kill everybody don't even take their women and
[13:21.600 --> 13:27.440]  children as slaves and salt the earth so they can't grow crops okay now i'm going off into history
[13:27.440 --> 13:32.000]  lessons and it's giving me a headache it may be giving you a headache so i'm going to move away
[13:32.000 --> 13:38.720]  from that middle of the next hour we're going to look at all these mainstream news articles with
[13:38.720 --> 13:49.920]  headlines like taliban caught with us arms taliban protected by us coalition forces protect some
[13:49.920 --> 13:57.440]  taliban taliban flown out to safety i mean there's been a lot of new articles but i want
[13:57.440 --> 14:01.600]  watson to go over some of the older ones out of the times of london and other places msnbc
[14:01.600 --> 14:07.120]  where six thousand taliban and al qaeda cream the commanders were taken out of the country
[14:07.120 --> 14:12.080]  and then all these special forces commanders a colonel wrote an article for the san francisco
[14:12.080 --> 14:18.240]  chronicle and said look i don't know what's going on but we capture these people including
[14:18.240 --> 14:23.200]  taliban generals and we're ordered to give them money and let them go and we're reprimanded something
[14:23.200 --> 14:29.040]  didn't right and pat tillman started writing letters home to mama and to other people talking
[14:29.040 --> 14:34.080]  about this and they they murdered him so fast because they can ignore some colonel they weren't
[14:34.080 --> 14:39.840]  going to ignore that football star coming home and going look we're protecting the opium because
[14:39.840 --> 14:50.000]  pat tillman wasn't stupid he saw 9 11 he got angry this office has talked to his brother
[14:50.000 --> 14:53.520]  and then his brother said he would come on call him in a few months we called the number was
[14:53.520 --> 14:58.080]  changed i'd like to get pat tillman's brother on i like to get his mother his father on
[14:58.080 --> 15:02.960]  because that's a big story right there uh that the letters he was sending home now he was going to
[15:02.960 --> 15:08.400]  come home and be anti-war he was starting to question 9 11 he was questioning the opium
[15:08.400 --> 15:14.640]  because right when pat tillman got there what a year and a half after the invasion or so
[15:16.080 --> 15:20.640]  that was when the cultivation of poppies exploded and us troops were ordered to guard it
[15:20.640 --> 15:26.480]  and he wasn't stupid he's like well what i'm i'm guarding opium i'm gonna come home and talk
[15:26.480 --> 15:33.040]  about this and the boys upstairs said well he was useful to us before not anymore make it look like
[15:33.040 --> 15:41.280]  an accident we'll tell his mama he was a hero send him home in a pine box
[15:46.400 --> 15:50.320]  the more i think about afghanistan if we can just educate people about this
[15:53.520 --> 15:58.000]  by the way us forces have had incredible victories in afghanistan the whole thing
[15:58.000 --> 16:09.840]  has been an absolute total success from their true perspective from their true agenda not the
[16:09.840 --> 16:15.440]  one you're told about democracy and freedom and women getting to vote uh actually women could
[16:15.440 --> 16:21.280]  vote they were 60 of college graduates including daughters and lawyers in iraq they had rock and
[16:21.280 --> 16:26.240]  roll music on the radio there playboy was sold in stores i'm not necessarily saying that's an
[16:26.240 --> 16:33.520]  sign of a good culture but certainly a free culture uh comparatively and then now the women
[16:33.520 --> 16:39.760]  wear burkas and uh they keep their mouths shut and they're basically slaves in iraq our government
[16:39.760 --> 16:47.360]  has put an islamicist regime in what do you think they do what do you think happened in 1953 and i
[16:47.360 --> 16:57.200]  ran they had a poet uh laureate who was secular an anti-muslim extremist an anti-muslim brotherhood
[16:57.760 --> 17:04.400]  who was also anti-soviet but he trolled anglo-american oil and bp the name was mohammed mozadek
[17:04.400 --> 17:08.880]  that you know what we're gonna keep a little bit of our own money here from the oil and they said
[17:08.880 --> 17:15.200]  you know what meet the mulas and they gave them a bunch of automatic weapons and uh overthrow the
[17:15.200 --> 17:20.960]  country look get one thing straight for all you that have phobias out there of the muslim extremists
[17:20.960 --> 17:28.000]  running around those guys work for the new world order period you would have to be
[17:28.960 --> 17:35.040]  an ignorant moron to not know that if you go do any research it is an absolute open secret
[17:35.040 --> 17:43.520]  not debatable you got that i hope that's clear but the problem is these guys got so extreme
[17:43.520 --> 17:47.840]  in the late 90s that they actually said you know what we don't want opium anymore and we're not
[17:47.840 --> 17:57.280]  going to let anybody grow opium and opium supplies dried up and last number i saw it was 12 times what
[17:57.280 --> 18:04.720]  it was under the taliban in 2001 the amount of opium it's a world record it's many times the record
[18:05.840 --> 18:10.480]  the number i saw was twice the previous record before that from the peak back in the 70s the
[18:10.480 --> 18:17.280]  point is is that they are just flooding our society with it and uh so there were different
[18:17.280 --> 18:23.040]  factions of the taliban but those are the factions that then went to the u.s government said
[18:23.920 --> 18:29.280]  some bin laden isn't here and if you can show us evidence he did it we'll try to find him and
[18:29.280 --> 18:36.480]  deliver him to you those are the only people the unofficial ambassador to the un and to the u.s
[18:36.480 --> 18:41.760]  from afghanistan the religious clerics those are the guys they arrested the real taliban the real
[18:41.760 --> 18:47.360]  al qaeda whenever our troops would capture them they just put their hands up they'd get loaded
[18:47.360 --> 18:53.520]  on c 130's cia would walk in and say fly him into pakistan and here's a giant chest of gold
[18:54.480 --> 18:59.360]  i mean this actually came out in the news oh you caught the number one taliban commander
[18:59.360 --> 19:04.560]  here's a chest of gold thank you sir and the and the special forces commanders are like what are you
[19:04.560 --> 19:13.360]  doing you take your orders from me stand down release them that's how this country works okay
[19:13.360 --> 19:19.440]  that's who runs this country and their c 130's and jets are crashing every year we see another
[19:19.440 --> 19:24.960]  report of them crashing in the u.s or mexico or asia filled with heroin filled with cocaine
[19:24.960 --> 19:30.320]  filled with child sex slaves and it's in the news a tiny blurb and no one gets in trouble
[19:30.320 --> 19:34.800]  this is your government an absolute group of murdering criminals period
[19:37.360 --> 19:43.280]  and you've got it compartmentalized where the good fbi the good police the good military
[19:44.240 --> 19:48.160]  they don't know what's going on now there are those that are in the compartmentalized system

[24:08.960 --> 24:14.960]  about the banks that control the cia the fbi our military growing the opium
[24:14.960 --> 24:24.160]  in afghanistan and the cocaine controlling the production centers in columbia it just
[24:25.200 --> 24:31.360]  really shakes me up to know it can be in the new york times that mohammed carzai's brothers the
[24:31.360 --> 24:37.760]  main opium kingpin in afghanistan and he's on the cia payroll and it's just admitted
[24:37.760 --> 24:44.720]  that they're growing the opium and and and they admit it in a sideways way kind of like
[24:46.880 --> 24:52.080]  you might pass gas in church or something and i mean it's done just where you hope nobody notices
[24:52.080 --> 24:56.720]  but they still i hate to use a gross analogy but that's what it's like they just kind of let it out
[24:56.720 --> 25:02.720]  and just throw it on the table so it loses its power i mean if it was broken as a big investigative
[25:02.720 --> 25:10.240]  report cia controlling most of the opium supply bringing into us congress calls for decriminalization
[25:10.240 --> 25:16.160]  the hypocrisy must end no it's just buried in mainstream articles and i keep telling the story
[25:16.160 --> 25:20.800]  of three or four months ago we need to go into the bbc archives because everything is archived on
[25:20.800 --> 25:28.880]  the bbc and it was a report on bbc i was listening on serious i've gotten my car almost ran off the
[25:28.880 --> 25:35.040]  road and i'm sorry we've heard the story 10 times it's just too important maybe a listener can dig
[25:35.040 --> 25:39.840]  that out and put it on youtube or something send it to us or i'm trying to hire some more people
[25:39.840 --> 25:44.640]  to do research up here so i can point things out and then go find it but but it was a report on
[25:44.640 --> 25:53.040]  afghanistan and they just sideways admitted that the cia and the pentagon were growing the opium
[25:53.040 --> 25:59.520]  poppies and the report basically stated it's a delicate balancing act but of course the
[25:59.520 --> 26:06.560]  british accent a delicate balancing act with the taliban because if they don't work with the taliban
[26:06.560 --> 26:14.000]  and allow them to grow the opium they lose the money they need for schools and mosque and because
[26:14.000 --> 26:20.560]  there's not a lot of funding for rebuilding this is the only major cash crop in afghanistan so to
[26:20.560 --> 26:26.480]  take away their age-old product would hurt their culture and if they eradicated it would give more
[26:26.480 --> 26:33.760]  power to taliban factions that are that are opposing the coalition forces that's why the
[26:33.760 --> 26:39.680]  military is protecting the poppies and that's why it's at record production levels we talked to
[26:39.680 --> 26:48.080]  colonel blah blah and then they just admit it i mean i i cannot i can't deal with this
[26:48.080 --> 26:55.360]  yes that when you have a cable man or the phone lady or the meter reader or people putting carpet
[26:55.360 --> 27:00.400]  in your house or whatever it is they're spying on you looking for marijuana looking for heroin
[27:00.400 --> 27:07.120]  looking for cocaine and meanwhile most of the cocaine and heroin is brought in by government
[27:07.120 --> 27:14.960]  affiliated crime syndicates the only thing we can do to stop this immediately is just do not
[27:14.960 --> 27:24.240]  use drugs and by drugs i mean hard drugs i'm not up here judging people but don't use heroin
[27:24.240 --> 27:30.160]  extremely destructive don't use any opiates don't use painkillers don't use methamphetamine
[27:30.880 --> 27:37.920]  don't use cocaine but especially cocaine and heroin because when you buy that that is a tax
[27:37.920 --> 27:44.560]  going directly to the central banks who've been caught repeatedly laundering the money
[27:45.040 --> 27:48.640]  and then meanwhile the very same banks own and finance the big pharma companies that are
[27:48.640 --> 27:53.200]  openly pushing riddlin prozac and other drugs that are just as dangerous or more dangerous
[27:53.200 --> 27:57.440]  than heroin and cocaine and their molecular structure on the school kids i mean of course
[27:57.440 --> 28:01.920]  what do you expect from a drug dealing government they bring in the illegal drugs keeping me legal
[28:01.920 --> 28:07.760]  to have a monopoly and jack up the price they have a monopoly on the legal drugs uh through
[28:07.760 --> 28:14.480]  their patents so they charge exorbitant amounts of money for those skull and bones was founded
[28:14.480 --> 28:21.040]  by the opium trade that's mainline abc news skull and bones founded the entire cia
[28:25.680 --> 28:31.440]  even robert in arrows the good shepherd which is very accurate historically it admits it all
[28:31.440 --> 28:43.040]  with matt daemon what does it admit the drug dealers are the skull and bones they set up the
[28:43.040 --> 28:49.920]  cia and by the way they devil worship it's all in the movie mainstream movie hailed as a historical
[28:49.920 --> 28:57.520]  masterpiece absolutely accurate devil worshiping drug dealing i mean who are these people they're
[28:57.520 --> 29:04.320]  devil worshipers it's a big joke to them and they use your fake morals to enslave you all
[29:04.320 --> 29:10.640]  you fools that are for drug criminalization but why do they really target marijuana because it's
[29:10.640 --> 29:15.680]  not a deadly drug i don't think it's good in many respects it has a lot of good attributes and some
[29:15.680 --> 29:21.520]  bad i think it's abused it's gets stronger and stronger all the time it's actually in the hallucinogen
[29:21.520 --> 29:28.480]  class i mean i smoked pot some in high school and a few times in college and i didn't like it
[29:28.480 --> 29:36.000]  because it's heavy duty stuff folks so i'm not some yeah i get attacked by the pro pot people
[29:36.720 --> 29:42.480]  because i bash pot and say it's not perfect and then i get attacked by the anti pot people
[29:42.480 --> 29:47.440]  look just grow up folks the reason they go after marijuana is because anybody can grow it the global
[29:47.440 --> 29:57.120]  is done controlling we're on the march the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[33:40.160 --> 33:46.640]  have here in front of me in my stack including lou dobbs leaving cnn we're going to play his
[33:46.640 --> 33:54.720]  his is his farewell swung song he's been there since 1980 a founding news anchor
[33:56.000 --> 34:02.880]  and he has been driven out of cnn and there's a huge celebration by herald o revera and others
[34:03.520 --> 34:09.360]  saying that he's a racist all because lou dobbs talked about the fact that our borders wide open
[34:09.360 --> 34:14.640]  and that nafta and gat and the north american union and the spp are destroying our jobs and
[34:14.640 --> 34:22.400]  that many of the groups like la raza and mecha la raza's uh slogan is
[34:25.280 --> 34:32.160]  for those inside the race everything for those outside the race and nothing and and see lou
[34:32.160 --> 34:38.720]  dobbs whose wife's ispanic he's from south texas he's just like me i don't like black racist i don't
[34:38.720 --> 34:43.360]  like white racist i don't like hispanic racist i don't like asian racist and there's nothing
[34:43.360 --> 34:49.360]  more hypocritical than the left who uses racism uses minority which in many cases are now the
[34:49.360 --> 34:55.680]  majority racism against white people uh as a political tool i'm sick of it and so is lou dobbs
[34:55.680 --> 35:00.960]  and his house got shot up he has to have bodyguards he's getting death threats that's how the mexican
[35:00.960 --> 35:07.280]  mafia operates i mean they've hand-grenaded and shot reporters and fbi agents and police in new
[35:07.280 --> 35:15.280]  mexico arizona southern california and south texas these people mean business and they're
[35:15.280 --> 35:21.680]  killing and bombing and threatening and attacking reporters that expose drug cartels not just lou
[35:21.680 --> 35:28.080]  dobbs who comes out and mildly criticizes mecha and la raza and others and folks i've been to
[35:28.080 --> 35:34.640]  mecha and la raza meetings and rallies at the texas capital i mean they're openly chanting for those
[35:34.640 --> 35:40.480]  in the race everything for those outside the race nothing la raza means the race raza means race
[35:41.120 --> 35:46.720]  and you know i've gone and protested the kuklux klan more than 10 times you know there's videos
[35:46.720 --> 35:53.920]  on youtube you can just google alex jones protest the klan for over a decade and i've gone out and
[35:53.920 --> 35:58.720]  i've bullhorned la raza and mecha and maybe i need to do it some more because i'm not a hypocrite
[35:58.720 --> 36:05.200]  ladies and gentlemen and they're just as bad and i'm sick of it i'm sick of injustice i'm sick
[36:05.200 --> 36:10.320]  of hypocrisy and i'm tired of it and i'm not putting up with it anymore and i'm not putting
[36:10.320 --> 36:14.960]  up with lou dobbs house getting shot up and you shouldn't either so they've driven the amount of
[36:14.960 --> 36:21.440]  seeing in bought out his contract the only good show they had on cnn and it wasn't perfect lou
[36:21.440 --> 36:25.280]  dobbs certainly in perfect he's been on the show before oh well let's try to get lou dobbs back on
[36:25.280 --> 36:34.080]  that's a good idea oh boy all right let's just go ahead and go to your calls now or i'll never get

[36:55.120 --> 37:06.160]  the thought of where i'm going with this story here um we have uh we have to where if we don't
[37:06.160 --> 37:11.600]  have our first responders when it when the shit hits a fan i gotta let you go gotta let you go
[37:11.600 --> 37:18.320]  go anybody um
[37:20.320 --> 37:25.200]  let's go ahead and talk to linda in canada linda you're on the air
[37:27.040 --> 37:33.040]  alex i'm calling from ontario canada welcome we've been listening hi we've been listening to
[37:33.040 --> 37:38.560]  your show for the past year and a half and all the things you've been saying regarding that h1
[37:38.560 --> 37:44.080]  n1 and all these things now they've come to fruition here in canada with this vaccination it's been
[37:44.080 --> 37:49.840]  about the last two three weeks people have been lining up for this vaccination and there's all
[37:49.840 --> 37:55.120]  kinds of information saying they can the pregnant women can get adjuvanted they're a friend they
[37:55.120 --> 38:01.040]  can't and now it's okay for them to get the non-adjuvanted and we haven't gotten the vaccinations
[38:01.040 --> 38:07.360]  but i'm just worried about my children that um there's nobody really here like you saying anything
[38:07.360 --> 38:12.560]  about these things and the vaccinations and i know here in grade seven they have to get
[38:13.120 --> 38:19.280]  two hepatitis b shots plus the meningitis c shot well ma'am let me be clear with you linda
[38:19.280 --> 38:24.880]  i don't know how long you've been listening but in england in canada in australia it's all the
[38:24.880 --> 38:32.720]  same system as the u.s no one has to take the shots the only place they tried to make it law
[38:32.720 --> 38:40.080]  law was in new york state and massachusetts state and in new york it's already been beaten in court
[38:40.080 --> 38:47.280]  it's already being defeated in massachusetts so how can they tell people all over the u.s it's
[38:47.280 --> 38:52.240]  the law they have to take shots when the only places they've tried to make it mandatory it's
[38:52.240 --> 38:57.920]  been defeated new jersey is trying to make it mandatory they lie to you which is an even bigger
[38:57.920 --> 39:04.160]  crime they're not only trying to inject you with something that's dangerous they lie to you
[39:05.520 --> 39:10.960]  and tell you that you have to take the shots but they have waivers for the shots there is no law
[39:11.680 --> 39:17.520]  it is the school policy that they take these injections but they prey on people's ignorance
[39:17.520 --> 39:23.840]  of the facts to push this on you and and a big wake-up call for a lot of parents in canada england
[39:23.840 --> 39:28.160]  and the u.s is they'll go into the school and say you can't make my child take shots and they say
[39:28.160 --> 39:34.160]  yes you do have to and then if you demand the waiver form they will angrily give it to you and
[39:34.160 --> 39:38.400]  you will know that they were trying to lie to you and manipulate you so just to be clear ma'am
[39:39.040 --> 39:44.640]  in canada i've seen the laws you do not have to take any of the shots in fact you can pull up
[39:44.640 --> 39:49.280]  mainstream articles in the canadian press all over your big papers in the last month
[39:49.280 --> 39:55.440]  where your own government recommended that people not take the regular seasonal flu shot
[39:55.440 --> 40:00.960]  if they were going to take the h1n1 shot because the regular flu shot government study shows
[40:00.960 --> 40:07.520]  doubles your chances for some reason of getting the h1n1 so let's just get that clear linda your
[40:07.520 --> 40:12.240]  children don't have to take the shot if you don't want them to they're lying to you linda
[40:12.240 --> 40:18.480]  is there any shots that are saved because now they were just giving the goddess of vaccination
[40:18.480 --> 40:23.360]  and i refuse that shot and she was like basically the only one in the whole class that didn't get
[40:23.360 --> 40:32.160]  the shot and so to be clear they're saying in the school is it a public school yes that's how
[40:32.160 --> 40:36.880]  they do it here i mean if you've seen the reports in england australia and the u.s where they just
[40:36.880 --> 40:41.360]  give elementary students the shot without asking their parents or even if the parents say no
[40:41.360 --> 40:48.720]  they still line them up and do it again these are criminals ma'am right so i do see that so they
[40:48.720 --> 40:53.920]  they just told everybody you got to take it and everybody just lined up so is there any of these
[40:53.920 --> 40:59.120]  shots that are saved or none of them like the hepatitis b the ma'am you make your own decision
[40:59.760 --> 41:06.560]  but the hepatitis is one of the worst really and they're all shots of that in grade seven
[41:06.560 --> 41:13.040]  which is giving two shots plus a meningitis shot on top of that unbelievable meningitis is a very
[41:13.040 --> 41:20.400]  dangerous vaccine oh my god so then i won't let my son have it once he hits the grade seven what
[41:20.400 --> 41:24.880]  about the tetanus shot now they have to have a tetanus shot before they enter high school now
[41:24.880 --> 41:31.280]  that's another line and again they'll sell you that tetanus is the most essential vaccine to have
[41:31.280 --> 41:38.320]  and it does give you immunity generally for seven years from tetanus the problem is the
[41:38.320 --> 41:45.840]  tetanus shot is the number one shot they use to implant cancer viruses and sterilization
[41:45.840 --> 41:50.880]  and i've had medical doctors on it's been in mainstream news in africa and india where the
[41:50.880 --> 42:00.960]  un has been caught adding a hormone involved infertility it's essential to tetanus shots and
[42:00.960 --> 42:06.320]  so the body then has an autoimmune response to the hormone not just the tetanus and guess what
[42:06.320 --> 42:11.520]  when the un got caught they said oh it's in it it's an accident that we put this expensive
[42:11.520 --> 42:15.760]  hormone in there that has nothing to do with the manufacturer and my point is there it wasn't an
[42:15.760 --> 42:21.680]  accident then researchers that well i mean let me just finish this is key then researchers pointed
[42:21.680 --> 42:27.280]  out well wait a minute this un program is only for women why do you only want to give tetanus
[42:27.280 --> 42:32.480]  shots to women because it wouldn't have hurt men it was designed to sterilize women ma'am
[42:33.280 --> 42:39.520]  and so here's the deal when i ripped my finger off almost completely chopped it off it was hanging
[42:39.520 --> 42:44.160]  by skin the doctor came in to reattach it and they said i'm going to give you a tetanus shot and i
[42:44.160 --> 42:51.200]  said no and they said well you cut this on rusty metal uh you could die of tetanus and i said i'll
[42:51.200 --> 42:57.680]  take my chances honey i practice what i preach i told the female doctor and so she scrubbed it
[42:57.680 --> 43:03.440]  for about 20 minutes you know down into the meat and into the nub and into the cut and i was just
[43:03.440 --> 43:11.760]  fine so let me explain something to you i have not had a tetanus shot now if i step on a nail or
[43:11.760 --> 43:17.760]  something i'm going to go to the doctor and have him flashe it you know go up in there and make it
[43:17.760 --> 43:24.720]  bleed the problem is is its puncture wounds is where that stuff can grow but i'm not taking a
[43:24.720 --> 43:31.680]  tetanus shot anything else no that i was wanted to know if i can refuse any of these such and now
[43:31.680 --> 43:36.800]  i'm thinking actually my doctor she gave me a tetanus shot last year saying oh no it's a new
[43:36.800 --> 43:42.800]  thing normally cost $100 and she just gave me the shot like before i could even say no and now
[43:42.800 --> 43:47.920]  i'm thinking how is there any way i can reverse any of these effects of these shots well let's
[43:47.920 --> 43:52.560]  be clear uh we don't know that all the different varieties of tetanus are going to sterilize you
[43:52.560 --> 43:56.960]  we just know they've been caught spiking it i mean ma'am i appreciate your call i mean here's the deal
[43:58.480 --> 44:04.720]  i'm not even saying that vaccines couldn't be good some evidence shows they help sometimes
[44:04.720 --> 44:14.480]  the problem is we have a criminal elite of eugenicists who have been caught over and over again
[44:14.480 --> 44:20.720]  adding things to vaccines water supplies and food supplies to sterilize people everyone has
[44:20.720 --> 44:27.680]  got to see my film end game blueprint for global enslavement which details this agenda and then
[44:27.680 --> 44:33.760]  make your own decision make your own decision on whether you're going to take the flu shot
[44:33.760 --> 44:42.960]  the hepatitis shot the tetanus shot the one shot that i think
[44:46.720 --> 44:53.600]  is the hardest one to not take the one that was hardest for me not to take and to not give my
[44:53.600 --> 45:00.960]  family is the tetanus because tetanus vaccines really do save lives it really is a threat
[45:00.960 --> 45:07.200]  but i can't morally come on air and tell people i'm against vaccination and then do it to myself
[45:08.160 --> 45:14.800]  and it's a very hard decision to make a very very hard decision to make and once a year or so
[45:14.800 --> 45:18.720]  a nail stick in my hand or some type of rusty metal will stick and it won't bleed
[45:18.720 --> 45:22.720]  and you know to be frank i don't like going to the doctor i'll just take a knife and just
[45:22.720 --> 45:28.240]  stick it in there and get that sucker bleeding i mean that's how this works ladies and gentlemen
[45:28.240 --> 45:33.920]  uh but uh i'm not going to tell you what to do i wouldn't look down on people if they didn't give
[45:33.920 --> 45:39.520]  their daughters and sons tetanus shots the problem is i want to have grandchildren
[45:41.920 --> 45:49.120]  and the other issue is i have to do a cost-benefit analysis i mean tetanus is still extremely
[45:49.120 --> 45:54.800]  extremely extremely rare and hard to get most people to get tetanus get a puncture wound in a barnyard
[45:54.800 --> 46:00.720]  tetanus tends to grow in horse manure and cow manure
[46:03.280 --> 46:07.040]  so if i worked in the farming industry as i have in the past
[46:08.800 --> 46:15.360]  i would probably do deep research try to find a smaller company there are smaller companies
[46:15.360 --> 46:22.080]  i wouldn't buy any tetanus shots and i wouldn't take any tetanus vaccines that came from any big
[46:22.080 --> 46:25.520]  pharma company that that that sells vaccines to the un
[46:29.840 --> 46:37.040]  okay i mean it's real simple any huge vaccine program made by specific top tier vaccine companies
[46:37.040 --> 46:42.240]  anything they're really pushing on you and anything they tell you is free we know that
[46:42.240 --> 46:46.720]  they've been caught all over the world with those major programs tainting the vaccines
[46:46.720 --> 46:51.600]  from the research i've done smaller companies smaller lots uh
[46:54.960 --> 46:59.760]  it doesn't appear they're spiking them but because there's no real regulation over any of this
[46:59.760 --> 47:07.360]  they still have dirty labs dirty vaccine factories all sorts of yeast and fungus and dead bacteria
[47:07.360 --> 47:17.920]  and viruses and RNA and mycoplasms get into it this is such a big complex situation linda
[47:21.920 --> 47:31.040]  this is a huge huge huge huge huge issue i mean here's an example six years ago the food and drug
[47:31.040 --> 47:38.560]  administration approved and it's also approved in england and canada and many areas of europe a
[47:38.560 --> 47:48.480]  vaccine that is sprayed on meat it's a vaccine and in latin it uh it it's translated from latin
[47:48.480 --> 47:55.040]  to english to mean bacteria eating virus just search the term in fact guys do this for me
[47:55.040 --> 47:58.400]  if you get a chance search up the term and give me a mainstream article just because i want to
[47:58.400 --> 48:03.760]  read it to listeners i don't want them to just believe me um viruses to be sprayed on meat
[48:04.880 --> 48:10.960]  to kill bacteria it got approved five six years ago and they spray it on most meat you buy at the
[48:10.960 --> 48:16.720]  store if it's a nice juicy cut of steak it's probably not on there but baloney hot dogs chicken
[48:17.840 --> 48:21.440]  because they can then not have sanitary conditions in these slaughterhouses
[48:22.400 --> 48:26.640]  and have chicken manure and horse manure and cow manure and all this other stuff that gets on the
[48:26.640 --> 48:35.520]  meat that can and bacteria and ecoli and they can then not really clean it and just ship it to you
[48:35.520 --> 48:45.520]  because they spray a live virus on the meat now here's another issue their argument to get it approved
[48:48.960 --> 48:54.160]  was well these viruses are naturally occurring in your stomach yes at thousands and thousands
[48:54.160 --> 49:05.680]  of times at a lower level okay but the other big issue is they then breed these viruses in giant
[49:05.680 --> 49:14.640]  vaccine tanks mixed with all this other growth medium that has other viruses and bacteria in it
[49:14.640 --> 49:19.680]  that has then sprayed on your food and then there's all been mutations in the virus product
[49:19.680 --> 49:24.960]  that they're spraying on the meat ladies and gentlemen i mean we're eating a toxic brew we need
[49:24.960 --> 49:32.800]  to just say no they approved uh what seven years ago irradiation they're irradiating beef they're
[49:32.800 --> 49:38.800]  irradiating vegetables they're irradiating chicken they're irradiating fish and all the studies show
[49:38.800 --> 49:46.480]  it destroys the vitamin and nutrient ring structures it kills the food it it ruins its dietary value
[49:46.480 --> 49:54.880]  but see if they've irradiated it it can have ecoli on it because if they freeze a hamburger
[49:54.880 --> 50:00.320]  patty when it's got a coli when you thaw that sucker out that a coli reactivates so instead of
[50:00.320 --> 50:04.960]  instead of having clean slaughterhouses because you know a few people get sick and died things get
[50:04.960 --> 50:11.920]  cleaned up no no no we'll just basted in live viruses and we'll just send high-powered radiation
[50:11.920 --> 50:22.240]  through it here's an msnbc headline fda okay's bacteria eating virus to treat meat august 18th
[50:22.240 --> 50:29.520]  2006 i said five six years ago but this says it was only three and a half years ago whatever

[54:23.840 --> 54:30.080]  he's going to be joining us to talk about the new world order master plan what this means the
[54:30.080 --> 54:37.040]  society that the dollar is in freefall plunge right now i mean we sit here in a jovial fashion
[54:37.040 --> 54:41.760]  talking about the cia shipping in narcotics and world government being set up but do do you realize
[54:41.760 --> 54:47.760]  out there what the end of the dollar really means what this is going to do to our standard of living
[54:47.760 --> 54:51.840]  i mean we don't really have any manufacturing or even service left that's all shutting down
[54:51.840 --> 54:56.960]  so all we have is our dollar that could buy goods from the world well we're going to lose that now
[54:56.960 --> 55:02.720]  and uh i know a lot of people want to kind of hide their head in the sand from this but if we
[55:02.720 --> 55:08.320]  arrested the bankers or had congress change monetary policy or quit devaluing the dollar
[55:08.320 --> 55:14.480]  none of this would have to happen but the same bankers that engineered the implosion of last year
[55:15.680 --> 55:19.440]  to bring in this new system of control are the people that are in charge of everything
[55:19.440 --> 55:28.560]  now by the way i gave this number out yesterday and we got over 70 phone calls i gave it out
[55:28.560 --> 55:35.920]  one time we got over 70 phone calls so i we're becoming victims of our own success it's like
[55:35.920 --> 55:40.480]  trying to read all our emails every day we get thousands of them we got some good questions
[55:40.480 --> 55:44.000]  some good comments we're going to play some of those serious questions and comments later in
[55:44.000 --> 55:51.680]  the show as funny as this is this is not really what we're looking for uh we now have a listener
[55:51.680 --> 55:56.960]  comment line and you can call and leave a 60-second question comment message if you disagree agree
[55:58.400 --> 56:02.960]  as long as uh you don't take the lord's name in vain if there's no profanity
[56:04.320 --> 56:08.880]  you know as long as it's a serious focus question we'll get it on the air as funny as it is that
[56:08.880 --> 56:17.040]  sling blade called into the show this is not what we're looking for
[56:21.120 --> 56:30.400]  but i hate to do war order and the globalist i wish they would go away
[56:30.400 --> 56:39.760]  mm-hmm they they bought me mm-hmm but i love things right later
[56:42.640 --> 56:47.040]  okay that is not what we're looking for folks this is not playtime
[56:49.360 --> 56:54.720]  what i want is really one minute rants for questions or comments but i'd love one minute
[56:54.720 --> 57:00.000]  rants news that you think is important in fact that's really what i want i mean people are always
[57:00.000 --> 57:04.720]  saying cover this cover that or cover this event or cover al gore coming to town or we're looking
[57:04.720 --> 57:09.680]  for activists to show up to this meeting or alex why haven't you covered the fact that
[57:09.680 --> 57:14.960]  obama has announced he's going to sign an anti-gun un treaty that under treaty law
[57:14.960 --> 57:20.240]  will restrict the second amendment that's in roiders well we're going to get to that but
[57:20.240 --> 57:25.600]  the point is that's the type of issues you can call in with five one two six four six four four four
[57:25.600 --> 57:32.560]  four and by the way people that call in and leave 15 messages none of it's going to get on air we
[57:32.560 --> 57:37.600]  have to then spend time going over your messages one guy left 30 something messages buddy you're
[57:37.600 --> 57:44.320]  not going to be getting on air please you know let's be adults here um we've got people calling
[57:44.320 --> 57:50.800]  i'm going i want to talk to alex over and over again oh haven't helped me you know i just want
[57:50.800 --> 57:57.040]  to have a good time here but at the same time the sky is already falling we're already in the world
[57:57.040 --> 58:00.560]  government they're already butchering the dollar it's only going to get worse from here until we
[58:00.560 --> 58:06.480]  have a national awakening and say no and the one talk show host who seriously talked about this

[1:01:14.720 --> 1:01:21.200]  air hello sir i have listened to your program for many years you're doing a wonderful job my name
[1:01:21.200 --> 1:01:25.760]  is jeffry smith i'm based here in new york city of minhatten i'm northeast director of the american
[1:01:25.760 --> 1:01:31.760]  free press and i can tell you what you're saying is a hundred percent correct i live with these people
[1:01:31.760 --> 1:01:37.680]  i have tried lateral commission members as my neighbors i bump into bill de bergen by keys
[1:01:37.680 --> 1:01:44.240]  in the supermarket where i live okay i've known these people for many years they are exactly as
[1:01:44.240 --> 1:01:51.360]  deadly and exactly as malicious as you say and they want your kids they want your house they want
[1:01:51.360 --> 1:01:58.320]  everything they're out of their minds and do you know why they are allowed to do this for one reason
[1:01:58.320 --> 1:02:04.320]  because patriots around this country who are listening to this program from their rear ends
[1:02:04.320 --> 1:02:09.840]  in their little town and they cry about the symptomology of this why is this happening
[1:02:09.840 --> 1:02:15.680]  because these characters on the upper east side of minhatten and in london because increasingly
[1:02:15.680 --> 1:02:20.880]  the british are reaching into our country they always have but now it's out of control no damn
[1:02:20.880 --> 1:02:26.880]  well that they have a faith base where they can fire missiles into your little town around the
[1:02:26.880 --> 1:02:32.560]  country and destroy your lives and they're very sure that no one will fire a missile back here
[1:02:32.560 --> 1:02:40.080]  into new york that's their mentality everybody look lucard dalsky is doing exactly the right thing
[1:02:40.080 --> 1:02:46.560]  let me tell you right now nothing beats the street every patriot in this country should be listening
[1:02:46.560 --> 1:02:51.680]  there should be thousands of lucard dalsky's in the streets of new york yelling bloody murder
[1:02:51.680 --> 1:02:56.560]  this isn't this these problems aren't coming from pango pango they're not coming from
[1:02:56.560 --> 1:03:02.320]  pago north dakota they're not coming from san diego they're coming from two places the upper
[1:03:02.320 --> 1:03:09.200]  east side of minhatten and london prime london is highly restricted not so new york there should
[1:03:09.200 --> 1:03:14.640]  be patriots in the streets of new york yelling their bloody heads off about what's happening
[1:03:14.640 --> 1:03:19.840]  because if you just yelling your little town it doesn't matter because you're providing them a
[1:03:19.840 --> 1:03:24.240]  faith well i'll say this i mean i mean yelling bloody murder in your town wakes people up and
[1:03:24.240 --> 1:03:29.760]  this is a process but it is better to confront the globalist when algor comes to your local bookstore
[1:03:29.760 --> 1:03:35.520]  algor comes to a local event protesting you'll end up being in fact everywhere algor is going
[1:03:35.520 --> 1:03:40.960]  tennessee florida california he's getting booed he's getting heckled the people are bringing up
[1:03:40.960 --> 1:03:45.440]  that 30 plus thousand scientists say man may global warming is a fraud it's being brought up
[1:03:45.440 --> 1:03:50.720]  that he's a globalist that he wants population control everywhere people are going out and
[1:03:50.720 --> 1:03:56.880]  protesting him and instead of it being a one-way street where algor gets to spew his propaganda
[1:03:57.520 --> 1:04:03.680]  our people now are taking over the events and i guarantee you we're going to shut this guy down
[1:04:03.680 --> 1:04:10.800]  if they can't pass cap and trade this year next year their program is dead and it's already in deep
[1:04:10.800 --> 1:04:19.920]  trouble and again the power of when a geitner or a bernackie or a summers or the queen of england
[1:04:19.920 --> 1:04:25.120]  or any of these people go to events they've got to be bullhorned they've got to be protested
[1:04:25.120 --> 1:04:30.160]  people've got to point out that they're the tyrants they're the scum everywhere they go
[1:04:30.160 --> 1:04:36.240]  everywhere uh carl rove goes he's being bullhorned and shouted down great job jeff great call that's

[1:08:02.160 --> 1:08:09.120]  from florida i had a question about 9 11 i heard that that somebody well somebody said that they
[1:08:09.120 --> 1:08:18.800]  brought down the towers with lasers from uh from satellites and i had seen the there is a footage
[1:08:19.680 --> 1:08:25.040]  with a plane flying in the background there's a plane flying in the background as this is all
[1:08:25.040 --> 1:08:32.480]  happening uh so i don't know if your sources can confirm that but uh the alex jones show because
[1:08:32.480 --> 1:08:44.160]  there's a war on for your mind can i confirm that space lasers blew up the towers that marvin
[1:08:44.160 --> 1:08:52.320]  the martian did it for the strontium 12 detonator to destroy the earth you pesky earth creature
[1:08:52.320 --> 1:09:00.960]  i will disintegrate here that's another one of the comments we got into the comment line
[1:09:00.960 --> 1:09:10.240]  one of the questions i got yes i've heard all about space based sdi strategic defense initiative
[1:09:11.040 --> 1:09:17.280]  lasers from space the biggest lasers have trouble shooting a missile out of the sky
[1:09:17.280 --> 1:09:23.280]  that's why they use particle beams because a laser can deflect a particle beam have
[1:09:23.280 --> 1:09:30.080]  accelerates particles in the beam and has more uh punch more stopping power more penetration power
[1:09:32.480 --> 1:09:37.280]  now are there a lot of super secret classified weapon systems we don't know about no doubt
[1:09:38.080 --> 1:09:41.440]  but no there's no way lasers from space could disintegrate the towers
[1:09:41.440 --> 1:09:50.480]  um i like to focus on what i can prove we have firemen and police saying get back from building
[1:09:50.480 --> 1:09:55.200]  seven they're gonna blow it up they're gonna bring it down we have bbc 25 minutes before
[1:09:55.200 --> 1:10:00.960]  announcing that building seven had fallen in its own footprint before it fell we have clear blast
[1:10:00.960 --> 1:10:08.480]  squibs on all three towers as explosions go off and notice what the national media likes to focus
[1:10:08.480 --> 1:10:14.160]  into they like to focus in on the minority of 9 11 truthers that picked up on the paid disinformation
[1:10:15.200 --> 1:10:20.400]  that particle beams and space beams did it or that no planes hit tower one or two and it was
[1:10:20.400 --> 1:10:26.160]  holograms and and and the reason i knew these were agents day one if you didn't immediately accept
[1:10:26.160 --> 1:10:32.720]  their theory and immediately agree with them you were a fed even though a lot of these people were
[1:10:32.720 --> 1:10:38.960]  actual former feds themselves publicly uh and and the way they would run around just aggressively
[1:10:40.480 --> 1:10:45.520]  dressing up in clown suits at public events to make 9 11 truth look stupid you see these very
[1:10:45.520 --> 1:10:52.000]  people being used in the intro of the new national geographic piece it's clearly a poison pill
[1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:59.840]  operation to to engage in such ridiculous activity and behavior that that it discredits 9 11 truth
[1:10:59.840 --> 1:11:05.200]  that'd be like if i said the gulf of tonkin was staged it's now been declassified that our ships
[1:11:05.200 --> 1:11:09.360]  were never attacked in the gulf of tonkin and that that was used to start the vietnam war
[1:11:10.560 --> 1:11:15.120]  and instead of putting on the evidence that the lbj tapes have been released the nsa is declassified
[1:11:15.120 --> 1:11:20.000]  that the ci is declassified it in the last four years if i came on air and said
[1:11:23.680 --> 1:11:28.320]  aliens attacked our ships in the gulf of tonkin it was not the north vietnamese it was an alien
[1:11:28.320 --> 1:11:33.920]  false flag that would then discredit those of us that believe that the gulf of tonkin was staged
[1:11:35.360 --> 1:11:39.600]  now it's been proven and admitted that it was staged there's no debating that now
[1:11:42.160 --> 1:11:46.880]  you know we see this in the 60s 70s 80s and 90s with mainstream television shows
[1:11:48.160 --> 1:11:53.120]  about conspiracy theories and they would say tonight the private federal reserve
[1:11:53.120 --> 1:11:56.160]  reserve and next
[1:11:59.040 --> 1:12:02.400]  after the private federal reserve which is true and real and verified
[1:12:03.200 --> 1:12:08.240]  we will look at blood drinking space aliens from planet glibble glob
[1:12:09.840 --> 1:12:14.880]  see well they have a gross term for it it's something in the punch bowl
[1:12:16.640 --> 1:12:22.080]  it's you know it's like putting a centipede in the punch bowl or it's like putting cockroaches
[1:12:22.080 --> 1:12:25.840]  in the punch bowl or something else no one wants to drink out of the punch bowl
[1:12:28.640 --> 1:12:34.960]  see that's why they wanted lou dobbs gone he was an icon of of financial and television news
[1:12:34.960 --> 1:12:42.000]  29 years at cnn from its founding in 1980 he was highly respected and he would read official
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:47.360]  un documents this all started about six seven years ago when lou dobbs would read a un document
[1:12:47.360 --> 1:12:52.320]  about how they were going to set up a global government in the dollar set up a global currency and
[1:12:52.320 --> 1:12:57.360]  he'd always been on the global reservation he'd always gone along with the system been mainline
[1:12:57.360 --> 1:13:03.760]  so he had a contract where he had total editorial control it was his show and so he did a few reports
[1:13:03.760 --> 1:13:08.880]  but seven years ago or so about the un taken over america because he had their own documents
[1:13:08.880 --> 1:13:18.240]  and he was called a kook and so lou dobbs said okay i will just uh start doing more on this i'll
[1:13:18.240 --> 1:13:23.040]  start proving there's an spp i'll start proving there's a north american union i'll start showing
[1:13:23.040 --> 1:13:28.720]  you their own documents and their own admissions and he won he got top ratings he proved it was
[1:13:28.720 --> 1:13:36.000]  true he won over the audience number one ratings on cnn and they ran him out of there
[1:13:36.000 --> 1:13:42.400]  they convinced him the last year to tone it down a bit his ratings went down and they basically
[1:13:42.400 --> 1:13:46.880]  forced him out his house got shot up all this happened
[1:13:46.880 --> 1:14:00.080]  but so lou dobbs got run out of cnn
[1:14:00.080 --> 1:14:19.040]  and so he was basically driven out of cnn and the celebration the the huge celebration
[1:14:19.040 --> 1:14:32.320]  and dealing with this is everywhere the radical mecho loraza bullies are celebrating that their
[1:14:32.320 --> 1:14:37.840]  racism succeeds they get to call for all whites to be driven out of north america they get to
[1:14:37.840 --> 1:14:42.560]  have the slogan for those in our race everything for those outside the race nothing they get to
[1:14:42.560 --> 1:14:48.640]  sew racial division and cultural division and hatred while posing as if they're liberals who
[1:14:48.640 --> 1:14:54.560]  were against it see the globalist want our country divided the western states are already
[1:14:54.560 --> 1:15:00.160]  more than 50 hispanic no one wants to fight with hispanics hispanics are part of america hispanics
[1:15:00.160 --> 1:15:08.640]  are good americans by and large but the media is hyping and promoting and big fortune 500 companies
[1:15:09.520 --> 1:15:17.040]  are funding the most virulent anti-american pro-globalist forces out of mexico and latin america
[1:15:17.040 --> 1:15:22.240]  who openly say they want to break up this country as part of oslan and the big banks want to drive
[1:15:22.240 --> 1:15:27.360]  down the wages bankrupt the states with the welfare program so they can bring in more control
[1:15:27.360 --> 1:15:31.520]  and so that's why these groups are natural allies but if you're the average hispanic american you
[1:15:31.520 --> 1:15:36.160]  should love lou dobbs and actually the polls show that gallup poll 81 percent of hispanics want to
[1:15:36.160 --> 1:15:41.520]  control the borders well yeah hispanics aren't stupid they know 600 million latin americans
[1:15:41.520 --> 1:15:47.920]  that want to come here and growing 100 plus million in mexico they know that that will
[1:15:49.040 --> 1:15:54.800]  turn us into mexico turn us into a third world country we need to help mexico we need to
[1:15:57.280 --> 1:16:01.520]  make the people stay down there so they have a real revolution and take their country back
[1:16:01.520 --> 1:16:06.800]  from the corrupt oligarchs down there instead of using the us as a revolutionary steam valve
[1:16:06.800 --> 1:16:13.440]  for the criminals the corrupt the people fleeing the poorest to all come up here you know mexico
[1:16:13.440 --> 1:16:18.080]  has more billionaires in the u.s. did you know that mexico has tripled the natural resources
[1:16:18.080 --> 1:16:24.480]  in every index that the united states has more timber more oil better soil more gold
[1:16:26.240 --> 1:16:32.400]  more water mexico is incredibly rich like south africa or something but they have one of the
[1:16:32.400 --> 1:16:36.240]  poorest populations in the world because they have a corrupt elite and their corrupt elite print
[1:16:36.240 --> 1:16:42.320]  textbooks funded by the ford foundation given to all mexican schoolchildren the average person
[1:16:42.320 --> 1:16:46.880]  goes and gets a seventh grade education and in the fifth sixth and seventh grade they give them
[1:16:46.880 --> 1:16:52.000]  textbooks that we've published and posted online teaching them that america belongs to mexico and
[1:16:52.000 --> 1:16:56.720]  must be brought down and our government loves it because the globalists run our government and
[1:16:56.720 --> 1:17:01.760]  they want to break down the us and bring us into the north american union and make everybody slaves
[1:17:01.760 --> 1:17:11.120]  here is lou dobs yesterday with his swan song tonight i want to turn to a personal
[1:17:11.120 --> 1:17:16.880]  note if i may an address of matter that has raised some curiosity this will be my last broadcast
[1:17:16.880 --> 1:17:22.240]  here on cnn where i've worked for most of the past 30 years and where i have many friends and
[1:17:22.240 --> 1:17:28.880]  colleagues whom i admire deeply and respect greatly i'm the last of the original anchors here on
[1:17:28.880 --> 1:17:34.640]  cnn and i'm proud to have had the privilege of helping to build the world's first news network
[1:17:34.640 --> 1:17:39.840]  i'm grateful for the many opportunities that cnn has given me over these many years i've tried
[1:17:39.840 --> 1:17:45.440]  to reciprocate with the full measure of my ability and my energy over the past six months it's
[1:17:45.440 --> 1:17:51.200]  become increasingly clear that strong winds of change have begun buffeting this country
[1:17:51.200 --> 1:17:58.160]  and affecting all of us and some leaders in media politics and business have been urging me to go
[1:17:58.160 --> 1:18:04.800]  beyond the role here at cnn and to engage in constructive problem-solving as well as to contribute
[1:18:04.800 --> 1:18:10.560]  positively to a better understanding of the great issues of our day and to continue to do so in the
[1:18:10.560 --> 1:18:16.800]  most honest and direct language possible i've talked extensively with jonathan kline john's the
[1:18:16.800 --> 1:18:23.280]  president of cnn and as a result of those talks john and i've agreed to a release from my contract
[1:18:23.280 --> 1:18:29.360]  that will enable me to pursue new opportunities at this point i'm considering a number of options
[1:18:29.360 --> 1:18:35.360]  and directions and i assure you i will let you know when i set my course i truly believe that the
[1:18:35.360 --> 1:18:42.320]  major issues of our time include the growth of our middle class the creation of more jobs
[1:18:42.320 --> 1:18:47.680]  health care immigration policy the environment climate change and our military involvement
[1:18:47.680 --> 1:18:54.800]  of course in afghanistan and iraq but each of those issues is in my opinion informed by our
[1:18:54.800 --> 1:19:02.320]  capacity to demonstrate strong resilience of our now weakened capitalist economy and demonstrate
[1:19:02.320 --> 1:19:08.800]  the political will to overcome the lack of true representation in washington dc i believe these
[1:19:08.800 --> 1:19:14.640]  to be profoundly critically important issues and i will continue to strive to deal honestly and
[1:19:14.640 --> 1:19:20.960]  straightforwardly with those issues in the future unfortunately these issues are now defined in the
[1:19:20.960 --> 1:19:28.160]  public arena by partisanship and ideology rather than by rigorous empirical thought and forthright
[1:19:28.160 --> 1:19:35.120]  analysis and discussion i'll be working diligently to change that as best i can and as for the
[1:19:35.120 --> 1:19:40.400]  important work of restoring inspiration to our great free society and our market economy i will
[1:19:40.400 --> 1:19:45.440]  strive as well to be a leader in that national conversation it's been my great honor to work
[1:19:45.440 --> 1:19:51.200]  with each and every person at this wonderful network i will be eternally grateful to cnn

[1:24:24.320 --> 1:24:32.720]  to today the price of gold surged afp reports to an all-time high point above $1,123 per ounce
[1:24:33.920 --> 1:24:39.920]  on thursday as trade was driven by buoyant stock markets and the weak u.s currency analysts said
[1:24:39.920 --> 1:24:48.000]  on the london bullion market gold jumped as high as 100 and $1,123.38 an ounce the metal
[1:24:48.000 --> 1:24:53.120]  remained supported by stronger equities and weaker dollars at james more analyst and specialist
[1:24:53.120 --> 1:24:59.440]  metals at the bullion desk gold has blazed a record breaking trail in recent weeks on the
[1:24:59.440 --> 1:25:04.320]  back of the struggling u.s unit which makes the dollar price precious metal cheaper for buyers
[1:25:04.320 --> 1:25:11.520]  holding stronger currencies and therefore tends to boost demand i also have a big report out of
[1:25:11.520 --> 1:25:17.280]  the times of london and the london telegraph today that gold supplies are running out worldwide
[1:25:17.280 --> 1:25:23.280]  and with that headline ted anderson joins us yeah hey elixir right about that i mean barric
[1:25:23.280 --> 1:25:28.400]  gold has really had to cut back on its output and their short contracts are gone now they've
[1:25:28.400 --> 1:25:34.720]  really gotten trouble with that um the the output right now i mean it they used to get 12 tons or
[1:25:34.720 --> 1:25:42.160]  12 grams of gold per ton of ore at mines and now the average is down to three grams per ton so you
[1:25:42.160 --> 1:25:46.720]  can see what's been going on they've pretty well have depleted the ability to pull it out of the
[1:25:46.720 --> 1:25:52.000]  ground and now we have this big run in the marketplace currencies fallen apart uh the
[1:25:52.000 --> 1:25:57.200]  u.s dollar is weakening and obviously you know places like india china i mean you can just name
[1:25:57.200 --> 1:26:02.320]  it pretty much any country in the complete world including the united states right now
[1:26:02.320 --> 1:26:07.520]  is considering beefing up their reserves and and yeah it's putting a lot of pressure upward
[1:26:07.520 --> 1:26:13.760]  pressure on gold and let me give folks this news that just adds gas to the fire london telegraph
[1:26:13.760 --> 1:26:20.960]  today barric shuts hedgebook as world gold supply runs out global gold production is in terminal
[1:26:20.960 --> 1:26:26.160]  decline despite record prices and herculean efforts by mining companies to discover fresh
[1:26:26.160 --> 1:26:31.200]  sources of ore and remote spots according to the world's top producer barric gold
[1:26:31.840 --> 1:26:36.720]  erin re regent president of the canadian gold giant said that global output has been falling
[1:26:36.720 --> 1:26:41.280]  by roughly one million ounces a year just the start of the decade total mine supply has dropped
[1:26:41.280 --> 1:26:47.280]  by 10 pc as ore quality erodes implying that the roaring bull market of the last eight years
[1:26:47.280 --> 1:26:52.640]  may have further to run so adding to the dollar imploding and all these currencies pouring into
[1:26:52.640 --> 1:26:58.640]  gold and the imf selling gold off and people grabbing it up uh we're they're now coming in
[1:26:58.640 --> 1:27:03.360]  with what we've been talking about for years that gold supplies coming out of the ground
[1:27:03.360 --> 1:27:10.800]  are shrinking quickly and no new major veins are being found ted i mean i tell you some of these
[1:27:10.800 --> 1:27:15.040]  analysts might might be right it might go to several thousand dollars an ounce of four or five
[1:27:15.040 --> 1:27:20.720]  six seven thousand i don't know this is crazy you happen to again have bought gold when it was a lot
[1:27:20.720 --> 1:27:26.400]  less you're about to run out of gold that you bought in the market when it was what 1050 or so
[1:27:26.400 --> 1:27:31.120]  tell folks quickly about today's offer and what you've gotten how long it's gonna last well yeah
[1:27:31.120 --> 1:27:36.480]  with gold running up like it did i just held my prices i'm still at 246 on the frank and a british
[1:27:36.480 --> 1:27:43.200]  sovereign at 299 both of those should be well higher than they are right now um the u.s eagles
[1:27:43.200 --> 1:27:48.000]  the maple leafs i mean i'm just trying to think of all the different products that we have i'm
[1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:53.040]  out of those grand bars those are pretty cool but they're gone uh you know the thing about it is
[1:27:53.040 --> 1:27:57.760]  alex i mean my my sales people are talking to people that have been going down to their local
[1:27:57.760 --> 1:28:01.520]  coin dealers and they're trying to buy gold and silver coins and there's just not enough supply
[1:28:01.520 --> 1:28:06.000]  yeah that's in the news a lot of even big dealers are running out or have huge premiums a lot of
[1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:11.600]  the small shops are completely out are almost out not ted anderson he's a big player been doing this
[1:28:11.600 --> 1:28:18.240]  30 years he's got it and at under market prices this is an insanely good deal in my opinion give

[1:28:42.400 --> 1:28:47.440]  wait waiting means more money and that's what's just been going on i've had customers ask me that
[1:28:47.440 --> 1:28:52.080]  should i look for a lower price should i wait and i and the truth of the matter is even if you wait
[1:28:52.080 --> 1:28:55.680]  a matter of four weeks you could be paying a hundred dollars and all it's more for gold
[1:28:55.680 --> 1:29:00.800]  and i just i don't think it that's worth the risk i mean yeah i'll be buying when the market goes down
[1:29:00.800 --> 1:29:06.160]  i've already discounted the price and reflecting with that uh but uh you know what the gold prices
[1:29:06.160 --> 1:29:10.640]  are going up i don't think that waiting around and and trying to find a better time i don't think

[1:33:14.560 --> 1:33:20.480]  directly to Jeff, Matt, Gabe, Jim, Ken and others then before gee ever Griffin joins us i've got a
[1:33:20.480 --> 1:33:27.440]  huge news blitz of just incredibly important news that i haven't gotten to number one Reuters is
[1:33:27.440 --> 1:33:35.200]  reporting Obama says he's going to sign a UN treaty that has power over our congress that can
[1:33:35.200 --> 1:33:41.040]  potentially ban firearms i mean you cannot make stuff up this bad this this is insane so that's
[1:33:41.040 --> 1:33:46.720]  coming up as well will raise the alarm yet again and don't forget they're going to mark up to the
[1:33:46.720 --> 1:33:51.120]  well they've have marked it up it's going to the full senate's past the house that the government
[1:33:51.120 --> 1:33:58.400]  obama care of the takeover of health care the 17th that's five days from now next week they're
[1:33:58.400 --> 1:34:02.400]  going to try to pass the health care bill in the senate and they're talking about the week after
[1:34:02.400 --> 1:34:09.200]  that by the 21st or second trying to pass the carbon tax takeover bill it's all happening
[1:34:09.200 --> 1:34:14.960]  right now obama came in he brought a bunch of democrats in his approval rating is plunging as
[1:34:14.960 --> 1:34:20.160]  people find out he's a globalist just like bush but he still got the congress and the executive
[1:34:20.160 --> 1:34:27.440]  he's got the trifecta and he can ram through basically anything he wants barring a miracle
[1:34:28.320 --> 1:34:34.480]  call congress call the senators call the white house go crazy they said that hate crime bill
[1:34:34.480 --> 1:34:38.640]  restricting free speech wouldn't pass it did they said the health care bill and the carbon
[1:34:38.640 --> 1:34:46.080]  tax bill wouldn't pass the house it did i mean this is serious business going on right now by the way
[1:34:47.600 --> 1:34:55.200]  we sold out of the first printing of fall the republic and i was on the fence on what cover
[1:34:55.200 --> 1:35:02.080]  i wanted to use it is fall the republic volume one the presidency of barraque h obama because
[1:35:02.080 --> 1:35:07.360]  obama is the frontman obama is the puppet he's the guy that they're selling their agenda on
[1:35:07.360 --> 1:35:12.480]  i actually feel sorry for obama at a certain level he's a puppet just like bush president obama
[1:35:12.480 --> 1:35:18.880]  is a slick harvard lawyer reading off a teleprompter that's why he can't give a speech without one
[1:35:18.880 --> 1:35:24.800]  it's not that he isn't smart it's that he has an agenda he isn't basically allowed to even talk
[1:35:24.800 --> 1:35:30.960]  unless it's prescripted just like bush he was just a terrible teleprompter reader but the film
[1:35:30.960 --> 1:35:38.400]  is titled the presidency of barraque h obama because it's again all being sold under him but
[1:35:38.400 --> 1:35:44.560]  i decided to have this new run go with my second favorite cover and and and the more i looked at
[1:35:44.560 --> 1:35:50.320]  it it is my favorite so i went with this and we just got them in today fall of the republic with
[1:35:50.320 --> 1:35:54.640]  the statue of liberty plunging down to the ground i think this is probably even a better cover
[1:35:55.280 --> 1:35:59.120]  and so i'll show you this cover next hour when we go live at prisonplanet.tv
[1:35:59.120 --> 1:36:05.120]  and now any dvds you buy at info wars.com we'll have the new cover and if you already have the
[1:36:05.120 --> 1:36:10.560]  first run why not buy the second run because that's how you support us and finance our expansion here
[1:36:10.560 --> 1:36:16.640]  and believe me our audience has tripled in the last two years more than tripled internet ratings
[1:36:16.640 --> 1:36:25.680]  am fm all the ratings all the statistics show a tripling at least guess what we're making the
[1:36:25.680 --> 1:36:31.920]  same amount of money we were making two years ago so we've tripled our audience and we're just staying
[1:36:31.920 --> 1:36:39.280]  the same when it comes to financing that scares me because following the trend that means in a year
[1:36:39.280 --> 1:36:44.400]  as the economy worsens we're going to start having trouble paying the bills a lot of people
[1:36:44.400 --> 1:36:47.920]  already can't pay the bills and they're going bankrupt that's why we're not making as much
[1:36:47.920 --> 1:36:56.480]  money as we were so see it as a donation as support so we can continue and be strong when
[1:36:56.480 --> 1:37:01.520]  you purchase the books and videos at info wars.com you can also call toll free we have some combo

[1:37:17.520 --> 1:37:22.480]  make great christmas gifts and also announce something like i didn't think when we were
[1:37:22.480 --> 1:37:26.960]  going to have watson on today about this other issue that i would bring this up but i i didn't
[1:37:26.960 --> 1:37:32.240]  psychologically notice that we're doing two things today watson who heads up prison planet dot tv

[1:39:53.040 --> 1:40:00.320]  getting better okay you know i tend to get corruption fatigue somebody who works in a
[1:40:00.320 --> 1:40:05.200]  slaughterhouse doesn't get upset by seeing cows have their throat slit and hitting the hair
[1:40:05.200 --> 1:40:11.200]  hitting the head with a high-powered jackhammer well it's the same thing with this tyranny
[1:40:12.880 --> 1:40:16.800]  i psychologically began to realize the last few weeks that i haven't gotten
[1:40:16.800 --> 1:40:22.960]  as upset as i should and i haven't made as big a deal as i should about the fact that there are
[1:40:22.960 --> 1:40:30.400]  scores of articles in france and germany and england mainstream news saying why are us troops
[1:40:30.400 --> 1:40:36.400]  busing and flying taliban and al-qaeda around why are they protecting the opium fields why do they
[1:40:36.400 --> 1:40:42.720]  keep catching taliban and al-qaeda with us weapons why is the west using different taliban groups
[1:40:42.720 --> 1:40:48.240]  against other taliban groups and so we have all these headlines and that made me go back to the
[1:40:48.240 --> 1:40:56.880]  times of london and other msnbc as well it's in my film road to tyranny 2002 the airlift of evil
[1:40:56.880 --> 1:41:03.840]  is what msnbc called it were 6 000 taliban and al-qaeda commanders at the end of the so-called
[1:41:03.840 --> 1:41:09.200]  afghan war were loaded on c 130's and flown to safety and af in pakistan to then start waging
[1:41:09.200 --> 1:41:14.640]  war against that government and top u.s military officials went public and said why are we protecting
[1:41:14.640 --> 1:41:21.120]  these people and it turns out the taliban who was founded by the cia in the late 1970s they
[1:41:21.120 --> 1:41:24.240]  actually started the war with the russians it's just a historical fact rizinski's written a book
[1:41:24.240 --> 1:41:29.840]  about it and brags about it and this is a long story short folks it's an incredible labyrinth of
[1:41:29.840 --> 1:41:36.080]  evidence and that they just went and got goat herders and poor people and 12 13 14 year old
[1:41:36.080 --> 1:41:42.080]  kids put them in the front lines and our generals noticed they weren't allowed to bomb the actual
[1:41:42.080 --> 1:41:47.680]  taliban and al-qaeda strongholds they can only bomb these conscripts in these foxholes it was
[1:41:47.680 --> 1:41:53.440]  totally staged war then the real taliban and al-qaeda once the cities were handed over were
[1:41:53.440 --> 1:41:59.040]  flown out to safety so it was a totally staged war now that's even more of that evidence is coming
[1:41:59.040 --> 1:42:04.160]  out so the question is why are our troops really there paul joseph watson give us a news blitz
[1:42:04.160 --> 1:42:14.160]  well the fact is the the height of the bush administration's 2007 surge in iraq there were
[1:42:14.160 --> 1:42:21.120]  a total of 186 000 troops in both iraq and afghanistan there were 26 000 in afghanistan
[1:42:21.120 --> 1:42:30.400]  and 160 000 in iraq now nearly a year after that so-called peace candidate the nobel peace prize
[1:42:30.400 --> 1:42:40.720]  winner obama is in office there are now at least and i stress at least 189 000 troops in afghanistan
[1:42:40.720 --> 1:42:47.680]  in iraq so there are more troops now deployed than they were at the height of the bush administration
[1:42:48.400 --> 1:42:55.120]  and all that obama has done is moved a bunch of the troops from iraq to afghanistan and obviously
[1:42:55.120 --> 1:43:02.880]  to create that justification you need the phantom of an enemy and that's what the taliban provides
[1:43:03.600 --> 1:43:11.440]  now eight years after the invasion more than eight years the taliban now have permanent strongholds
[1:43:12.320 --> 1:43:19.200]  in 80 percent of afghanistan so if the goal of the war on terror was to eliminate the taliban
[1:43:19.200 --> 1:43:25.600]  from afghanistan it completely failed and why well that's because the taliban since the
[1:43:25.600 --> 1:43:33.840]  their very creation by the pakistani isi and the cia in the 80s serve as the fundamental
[1:43:33.840 --> 1:43:40.480]  justification for the u.s presence in afghanistan so they need them to remain there now we look at
[1:43:41.600 --> 1:43:46.800]  what the pentagon is doing in afghanistan what it's done over the last three years and it what
[1:43:46.800 --> 1:43:52.720]  it plans to do over the coming years which is namely just as they've done in iraq to build
[1:43:52.720 --> 1:43:59.920]  military bases in the country they've spent 2.7 billion dollars over the last three years building
[1:43:59.920 --> 1:44:06.800]  military bases in afghanistan and they're going to spend another 1.3 billion dollars over the next
[1:44:06.800 --> 1:44:14.240]  couple of years building another 40 military bases in afghanistan so they need the taliban there
[1:44:14.240 --> 1:44:21.600]  is a justification to remain in the country and this is why we see articles such as such as the
[1:44:21.600 --> 1:44:30.640]  one today out of the nation how the u.s funds the taliban about how the u.s government just pays off
[1:44:31.200 --> 1:44:37.360]  these taliban members so they don't chew at them as he said the taliban is divided into numerous
[1:44:37.360 --> 1:44:44.240]  factions and many of them are for sale to the highest bidder and the u.s simply pays them off
[1:44:44.240 --> 1:44:49.120]  and the taliban allows their supplies to get through so it's a completely phony war
[1:44:49.760 --> 1:44:55.280]  and then you've got the other faction of the taliban which is blowing the whistle on the fact that
[1:44:56.800 --> 1:45:04.480]  a lot of the taliban leaders are in the direct pay of the cia and israel which is exactly what
[1:45:04.480 --> 1:45:15.680]  kary the nudin said back in june he's a tribal leader in pakistan the taliban member who defected
[1:45:16.400 --> 1:45:23.520]  he blew the whistle on the fact that another pakistani taliban chief called baitul al masoud
[1:45:24.240 --> 1:45:32.160]  was in the pay of the cia and mosad and shortly after he was assassinated by that very pakistani
[1:45:32.160 --> 1:45:38.480]  taliban chief so anybody who calls them out on the fact that they're just mercenaries for hire
[1:45:38.480 --> 1:45:45.440]  was the cia and the israelis are paying off to continue their domination in afghanistan
[1:45:46.800 --> 1:45:54.560]  get assassinated then of course you have the revelations that were reported in the new york
[1:45:54.560 --> 1:46:04.160]  times recently about how the afghanistan president hamed karzai who has just had his phony corrupt
[1:46:04.160 --> 1:46:11.440]  election victory validated by the un even though it was blatantly fraudulent his brother
[1:46:12.320 --> 1:46:19.120]  is the kingpin of the country's booming opium trade in afghanistan which as we know
[1:46:19.120 --> 1:46:26.000]  is still at record level 92 percent of the opium exported in the world comes out of afghanistan
[1:46:26.000 --> 1:46:33.120]  and ends up on our streets and destroys young people's lives in the west now the kingpin over
[1:46:33.120 --> 1:46:41.200]  that in afghanistan one of them is hamed karzai's brother called hamed walley karzai and as the
[1:46:41.200 --> 1:46:50.400]  times reported on october 28 he is directly on the cia payroll he's a middleman for the opium
[1:46:51.200 --> 1:46:58.160]  exports out of afghanistan that has been controlled by the cia since at least the 80s and of course
[1:46:58.160 --> 1:47:06.320]  that was interrupted briefly before 9 11 when the taliban leaders cut down on opium production
[1:47:06.320 --> 1:47:14.240]  and it was caused ramped up beyond all record after the invasion in 2001 now what the nation
[1:47:14.240 --> 1:47:25.120]  article also brings to light is the fact that hamed ratheb polpal who is another taliban leader
[1:47:25.120 --> 1:47:34.320]  in afghanistan um former taliban leader when the invasion happened in 2001 and he was instrumental
[1:47:34.320 --> 1:47:43.040]  in the mojahedin effort against the soviets in the late 80s he's also the cousin of the president
[1:47:43.040 --> 1:47:50.320]  hamed karzai and he is also instrumental in overseeing the opium production and the opium
[1:47:50.320 --> 1:47:57.360]  exports out of afghanistan as well as his brother so that's two cousins of hamed karzai who are
[1:47:57.360 --> 1:48:04.720]  instrumental on that and these two guys are actually charged in the united states and they
[1:48:04.720 --> 1:48:13.840]  pleaded guilty to importing heroin into the united states in 1996 and now they're in afghanistan
[1:48:13.840 --> 1:48:21.360]  overseeing the opium production overseeing the imports into the u.s even though they're convicted
[1:48:21.360 --> 1:48:30.400]  drug dealing criminals but they're now representing uh the cia's interest in terms of opium production
[1:48:30.400 --> 1:48:35.520]  the next well paul we've got about two minutes left to hit on other little key points but
[1:48:35.520 --> 1:48:40.640]  i want listeners to understand we're merely grazing the surface here it is a joke
[1:48:42.640 --> 1:48:46.400]  how much of this is publicly admitted and how brzezinski's written two books about it
[1:48:46.400 --> 1:48:54.960]  uh obama's chief foreign uh policy advisor it is a joke how public this is
[1:48:55.840 --> 1:49:01.600]  and it's just incredible incredible hypocrisy so in summation any other little tidbits you
[1:49:01.600 --> 1:49:07.600]  want to point out uh and of course on top of that then your take on what the real reasons are that
[1:49:07.600 --> 1:49:14.160]  we're in afghanistan and will never be leaving well the reasons are that they want to build the
[1:49:14.160 --> 1:49:20.960]  military bases as a launch pad to go into iran and to go into the few remaining other countries
[1:49:20.960 --> 1:49:27.360]  that are not completely under the control and jurisdiction of the u.s military industrial
[1:49:27.360 --> 1:49:34.320]  complex in the meantime they're making vast profit profits in this huge black hole of the
[1:49:34.880 --> 1:49:40.480]  weapons sales and logistics and of course the opium production and don't forget sex trade
[1:49:40.480 --> 1:49:47.840]  they're kidnapping kids that's admitted mainstream news yeah but long term it's just about geopolitical
[1:49:47.840 --> 1:49:54.320]  domination as is laid out in the project for any of american century game plan full spectrum
[1:49:54.320 --> 1:50:01.440]  domination and uh they're they're getting the military bases in place now they've already built
[1:50:01.440 --> 1:50:06.800]  over a hundred they're building more in the country and you can't remain in the country you can't
[1:50:06.800 --> 1:50:12.240]  occupy the country if you don't have the mirage of an enemy to sell to the general public that's it
[1:50:12.240 --> 1:50:16.720]  so they manufacture the enemy for just a few billion dollars and then have a multi trillion
[1:50:16.720 --> 1:50:22.320]  dollar war and it doesn't matter if bush leaves office or obama or mitt romney or whoever's coming

[1:54:15.920 --> 1:54:22.800]  her on the air hello yes sir hey alex how you doing today good sir you've had a great
[1:54:22.800 --> 1:54:26.640]  show so far i've sat and uh been entertained and listened to you up to this point been patient
[1:54:26.640 --> 1:54:32.880]  on on hold here i wanted to add to your geopolitical control mechanism and i want to go back to a
[1:54:32.880 --> 1:54:38.560]  statement that geitner said that we should take advantage of any kind of disaster or natural
[1:54:38.560 --> 1:54:43.280]  occurrence or whatever so that we can uh push some the you know genders through that we normally
[1:54:43.280 --> 1:54:50.080]  couldn't push through and i was also said in a wall street journal tv interview uh with
[1:54:51.040 --> 1:54:59.120]  the uh real head of the white house uh rama manual right i remember that as well i wanted
[1:54:59.120 --> 1:55:05.520]  to bring attention to the southeast portion of united states here lately because we have
[1:55:05.520 --> 1:55:10.000]  been suffering through quite a lot of rain and flooding recently and i wanted to talk about how
[1:55:10.000 --> 1:55:15.120]  fema created their uh flood zones and expanded it after the hurricane Katrina Katrina disaster
[1:55:15.120 --> 1:55:18.800]  they did the same thing in austin they've made the floodplain on lake travis
[1:55:20.160 --> 1:55:24.960]  it's almost 20 feet higher than it's ever been areas that have never had water on them
[1:55:24.960 --> 1:55:31.280]  and that gives fema jurisdiction right and and we're facing the same problem here in northeast
[1:55:31.280 --> 1:55:38.800]  georgia where we're dealing with fema's map that's placed in our entire home in a in a flood zone
[1:55:38.800 --> 1:55:43.440]  where oh yeah they're saying they're saying mountaintops literally hilltops they're now
[1:55:43.440 --> 1:55:49.840]  saying in austin our floodplains sure and we're you know we have very much control of all our
[1:55:49.840 --> 1:55:55.040]  water here and um the truth of the matter is it looks like that they're drawing this information
[1:55:55.040 --> 1:56:00.080]  from from topographical features of maybe 35 or 40 years old and they haven't even taken
[1:56:00.080 --> 1:56:05.120]  in consideration the development of our neighborhood much less our our street out front that's
[1:56:05.120 --> 1:56:11.760]  actually sitting in a flood zone apparently and um what that is amongst other things is a big gift
[1:56:11.760 --> 1:56:16.480]  to the insurance companies because now they can jack up your prices and control development
[1:56:17.520 --> 1:56:21.360]  right and you know the insurance companies are getting hit hard these days with
[1:56:21.360 --> 1:56:28.080]  all kind of flood claims and and whatnot but i wanted to say that this is the time that we
[1:56:28.080 --> 1:56:36.240]  can actually as the people use this all this rain as a weapon against this kind of uh political
[1:56:36.240 --> 1:56:43.200]  control because this is a perfect timing of events that will give us the way to collect the data and
[1:56:43.200 --> 1:56:48.400]  actually prove that the flood zone information in the mapping was incorrect and actually just
[1:56:48.400 --> 1:56:54.080]  rushed through to provide a uh an electronic database type system that fema worked off of
[1:56:54.080 --> 1:56:59.520]  yes fema needs to be opposed and its power grabs they've got another bill to say all above and
[1:56:59.520 --> 1:57:04.720]  below groundwater is now navigable rivers so the coast guard and the federal government
[1:57:04.720 --> 1:57:10.800]  can take control of it and restrict development it's all about the rewilding sure and and it'll
[1:57:10.800 --> 1:57:16.240]  it'll definitely uh heard a lot of families uh we're faced with fighting bank of america right
[1:57:16.240 --> 1:57:21.360]  now who recently uh took over our mortgage and bought it from a smaller company we feel like
[1:57:21.360 --> 1:57:27.520]  that we were almost targeted because of the uh mapping that fema was able to uh distribute
[1:57:27.520 --> 1:57:34.960]  you know nationally amazing jeff matt in california you're on the air hey what's up

[2:02:47.120 --> 2:02:53.840]  with camouflage on their faces no you cannot make this stuff up uh and and and we're just
[2:02:53.840 --> 2:02:58.960]  drowning in evidence we've got so much evidence coming in piling up of the slow incremental
[2:02:58.960 --> 2:03:02.720]  paramilitary takeover of the country that i don't even know where to start it's just
[2:03:02.720 --> 2:03:07.840]  mind-blowing what were the troops with their machine guns doing you're not exaggerating on
[2:03:07.840 --> 2:03:13.520]  any of this information at all i have i could throw out a million points here all my rich
[2:03:13.520 --> 2:03:18.080]  banking cousin does is tell me to get a life of them delusional to even question this stuff
[2:03:19.680 --> 2:03:25.360]  his wife works for uh fizer i mean these people are discussing you want to know what the order is
[2:03:25.360 --> 2:03:30.720]  come visit my family for a weekend you can go find out because these people are the same psychology
[2:03:30.720 --> 2:03:34.320]  that you have discussed with jad work riff and the same type of people
[2:03:35.120 --> 2:03:41.680]  discussing and i look at the population for example the yankees world series the yankees fan
[2:03:41.680 --> 2:03:45.840]  one where i see these people doing their chairing in the streets is they care more about the fact
[2:03:45.840 --> 2:03:50.000]  that they have philly fans out there they're willing to go out and fight in the streets i have
[2:03:50.000 --> 2:03:54.800]  video footage where fans are fighting each other they have more passion to fight each other over
[2:03:54.800 --> 2:04:02.560]  a baseball game than goldman sacks robbing the country for 23.7 trillion dollars in broad daylight
[2:04:02.560 --> 2:04:06.800]  i guess we gotta start telling these uh fans of the goldman sacks are a bunch of phillies
[2:04:06.800 --> 2:04:12.320]  they're our red sox fans and maybe these yankee fans will start waking up that's a good idea tell
[2:04:12.320 --> 2:04:17.040]  new yorkers that goldman sacks is the red sox and goldman sacks will all be arrested next week
[2:04:19.520 --> 2:04:23.920]  no i mean that's a great point you uh make that people will go out and riot and kill each other
[2:04:23.920 --> 2:04:28.880]  over to football or baseball or basketball game or you know when the bulls used to win in chicago
[2:04:28.880 --> 2:04:33.280]  you know they'd burn half the town oh but so what if foreign banks are openly killing the dollar

[2:10:45.200 --> 2:10:49.120]  griffin g edward i've got so many questions so many things i want to go over with you today but
[2:10:49.120 --> 2:10:56.240]  the first thing i want to ask you is 49 years fighting this publishing bestselling books really
[2:10:57.360 --> 2:11:04.240]  the name over the last half century uh you know you're the person that people point out and say
[2:11:04.240 --> 2:11:09.520]  he's he's the icon even if some of the old timers were still alive you would still be
[2:11:09.520 --> 2:11:15.360]  bigger than they are and i'm not saying that for ego i'm pointing out you have been a a prime mover
[2:11:15.360 --> 2:11:20.080]  a central force against the globalist and with the long view of history if we wouldn't have had you
[2:11:20.080 --> 2:11:26.080]  and others 50 years ago fighting and planting seeds and getting laughed at we wouldn't be having this
[2:11:26.080 --> 2:11:31.280]  giant awakening that's blooming today that is really threatening the globalist and they admit
[2:11:31.280 --> 2:11:35.520]  their own documents that you know that they could lose control that's why they're trying to bum rush
[2:11:35.520 --> 2:11:40.320]  us right now and bring in the entire program and accelerate it so people need to understand it's not
[2:11:40.320 --> 2:11:44.320]  going to be an instant victory and we'll talk about your long view of history and how we can beat
[2:11:44.320 --> 2:11:49.600]  these people uh coming up but first what is it like to see them openly announcing the world
[2:11:49.600 --> 2:11:54.720]  government openly announcing the carbon tax openly announcing it's going to be the imf as the world
[2:11:54.720 --> 2:12:01.760]  rulers we will pay our taxes to private bankers to al gore everything you wrote about 2030 40 years
[2:12:01.760 --> 2:12:07.520]  ago because you're reading their own documents to now see it actually taking place the republic
[2:12:07.520 --> 2:12:14.000]  is falling the dollar is falling world government is rising break that down get into the healthcare
[2:12:14.000 --> 2:12:20.000]  takeover the collectivist the carbon tax what we're witnessing and with your long view of history
[2:12:20.000 --> 2:12:26.560]  how do you think this fight is going to unfold g edward griffin well that's quite uh quite an
[2:12:26.560 --> 2:12:31.440]  interesting uh perspective uh wrapped up in a question there i have to answer your question
[2:12:31.440 --> 2:12:37.360]  with a single word it feels eerie it's like uh having a bad nightmare and you wake up and you
[2:12:37.360 --> 2:12:42.480]  say oh that was just a nightmare oh come on get it out of your mind it's just a nightmare repeat
[2:12:42.480 --> 2:12:47.680]  after me it's just a nightmare and then all of a sudden the events in the nightmare start to unfold
[2:12:47.680 --> 2:12:53.200]  before your eyes and you go back and you say oh no it's not a nightmare this is reality and it's
[2:12:53.200 --> 2:12:59.200]  that kind of an eerie feeling you could probably write a good uh a good movie around that theme
[2:12:59.200 --> 2:13:03.840]  a nightmare that becomes reality but that's really how i feel about it uh you know when you when
[2:13:03.840 --> 2:13:09.360]  you read the documents of the uh the elitists of the world and you know exactly what they plan
[2:13:09.360 --> 2:13:14.480]  and how they think it is sort of an academic experience in the beginning because you're
[2:13:14.480 --> 2:13:21.920]  still living in a system of a lot of freedom and and quite a bit of security and uh uh prosperity
[2:13:21.920 --> 2:13:27.360]  and so what you're saying even though you know it's true has this unreal like quality you think it
[2:13:27.360 --> 2:13:32.640]  well am i right are they really going to pull that off and then you look around and say yep yep
[2:13:32.640 --> 2:13:37.200]  they're moving on it so then you go back and you you get serious again but there's a long period
[2:13:37.200 --> 2:13:41.840]  in the beginning alex when i have to tell you it just didn't seem quite real even though i knew it
[2:13:41.840 --> 2:13:47.760]  was so here we are all these years later and now of course there's no question that these scenarios
[2:13:47.760 --> 2:13:53.600]  that we put together not our scenarios it was their scenario actually that it was quite real
[2:13:53.600 --> 2:14:00.000]  and we're we're living through it now and uh it's uh it's kind of like i use another analogy it's
[2:14:00.000 --> 2:14:07.040]  like you're drifting along in a in a uh a small row boat or a canoe and the water is kind of quiet
[2:14:07.040 --> 2:14:13.520]  and calm and the birds are singing it's a beautiful sunny day and and there's the the water is uh you're
[2:14:13.520 --> 2:14:17.920]  very calm and you're moving and enjoying watching the fish jump and all that sort of thing but you
[2:14:17.920 --> 2:14:23.040]  know you know because you've looked at the map you know that you're in a river that's headed
[2:14:23.040 --> 2:14:30.560]  toward a huge waterfall and you you have a pretty good idea that it's down there maybe uh have a
[2:14:30.560 --> 2:14:34.560]  couple of days away so you know you're not worried about it now but you know you've got to get out of
[2:14:34.560 --> 2:14:40.000]  that stream of water pretty soon and so you're drifting along and everything is fine but the
[2:14:40.000 --> 2:14:46.720]  closer you get to that waterfall the more rapid the water seems to move and now did we find ourselves
[2:14:46.720 --> 2:14:53.440]  with this little row boat moving quite rapidly uh and you could hear the sound the roar of the water
[2:14:53.440 --> 2:14:58.000]  uh you can't see it yet but you could hear it so that it's that's another way of looking at it
[2:14:58.000 --> 2:15:03.600]  i'm trying to give you the emotional experience that i have it's uh it's a very unnerving thing
[2:15:03.600 --> 2:15:07.600]  well that's i mean that is a perfect way to describe it and we've now rounded the bend
[2:15:08.160 --> 2:15:16.000]  and we see the mist and steam rising up from niagara and i believe we can now actually see
[2:15:16.000 --> 2:15:20.800]  the waterfall i mean they're openly announcing world government they're openly announcing
[2:15:20.800 --> 2:15:27.600]  carbon taxes micromanaging our lives one child policies uh times of london comes out and says
[2:15:27.600 --> 2:15:35.440]  billionaire club and bid to curb overpopulation secret meetings uh we know that this is a hellish
[2:15:35.440 --> 2:15:41.680]  system and just like people could hear the waterfall in 1917 russia or they could hear
[2:15:41.680 --> 2:15:48.000]  the waterfall in 1935 germany uh as bad as it already is we know it's going to get a lot
[2:15:48.000 --> 2:15:54.160]  lot worse and as you said as we near the fall the water gets faster and faster and faster and
[2:15:54.160 --> 2:15:59.440]  the globalists were denying they were blaring on loudspeakers from the woods on the sides of the
[2:15:59.440 --> 2:16:04.880]  river for decades that there is no waterfall everything's fine go to sleep in the rowboat
[2:16:04.880 --> 2:16:11.280]  relax drink a beer watch a ball game and now as we see the waterfall and see broken ships at the
[2:16:11.280 --> 2:16:16.640]  bottom from history and and and tyranny passed and mass murder passed and we see all the ghost of
[2:16:16.640 --> 2:16:22.720]  those killed by tyranny they're now saying oh it is a waterfall but you're only safe by going over
[2:16:22.720 --> 2:16:28.800]  the edge global government is the solution geber griffin well i think you said it's so well as
[2:16:28.800 --> 2:16:32.880]  usual alex yeah they're saying look if you stay where you are you're you're going to be dashed
[2:16:32.880 --> 2:16:38.720]  against a rock so therefore go over the waterfall come with us we will lead you over the waterfall
[2:16:38.720 --> 2:16:46.160]  there's a nice big lake down there it'll be all calm again uh you know the beginning of the uh
[2:16:46.160 --> 2:16:50.960]  video that you produced that magnificent video the fall of the republic you've got a speech
[2:16:50.960 --> 2:16:58.160]  by obama in which he's talking about uh the need for changes kind of his campaign rhetoric but
[2:16:58.160 --> 2:17:06.240]  rewrapped up in in post presidential uh events that yes we we had no choice so we had to uh we
[2:17:06.240 --> 2:17:11.760]  can't look back i he was saying we we can't ignore it we can't pretend like it's not there we must
[2:17:11.760 --> 2:17:17.600]  deal with in all of those platitudes and he's right in in that sense but um and then he says
[2:17:17.600 --> 2:17:24.560]  we cannot continue what we were doing but to any informed observer that's the biggest laugh of all
[2:17:24.560 --> 2:17:29.280]  because that is exactly what the president administration is doing they are continuing
[2:17:29.280 --> 2:17:34.400]  what they were doing except they're accelerating it somewhat so there's no change in direction
[2:17:34.400 --> 2:17:38.480]  it's always headed toward that waterfall and yes you're quite right they're saying you got to go
[2:17:38.480 --> 2:17:43.840]  over the waterfall because you can't stay where you are well that that's not much of a choice is it
[2:17:43.840 --> 2:17:52.320]  no it's not and on both sides of us are the republic beautiful fields forests you know we could
[2:17:52.320 --> 2:17:58.640]  build our civilization back if we had the engine of liberty but instead they're saying oh no don't
[2:17:58.640 --> 2:18:03.360]  get out of the boat just just keep going over the waterfall everything is going to be fine
[2:18:04.080 --> 2:18:09.680]  but we know it's not going to be fine we know that's a thousand foot drop down to those rocks below
[2:18:09.680 --> 2:18:15.920]  we know that hundreds of other civilizations have gone over these falls haven't they oh yes they have
[2:18:15.920 --> 2:18:23.200]  and uh i guess it's time to abandon the analogy um because actually what the people who are calling
[2:18:23.200 --> 2:18:29.840]  the shots today um they don't like the rowboat worry it that rowboat provides way too much uh
[2:18:30.480 --> 2:18:36.800]  stability for people in them and they really want that rowboat destroyed that they want the people
[2:18:36.800 --> 2:18:43.600]  in the water they want the people that you know clamoring for life rings or you know life savers
[2:18:43.600 --> 2:18:47.760]  that that the government would throw out to them because they want the people out of those boats
[2:18:47.760 --> 2:18:53.280]  and into the water and that that's the reality because they're sharks the banks in their own
[2:18:53.280 --> 2:18:58.880]  documents want vertical integration as moray strong said they want to wreck the economy so we all go
[2:18:58.880 --> 2:19:05.920]  on collectivist welfare so they can call the shots on everything exactly their power freaks
[2:19:05.920 --> 2:19:12.080]  and that's how they get their jollies and that that's it it's the only trick they know uh
[2:19:12.080 --> 2:19:16.720]  they're collectivists they believe in that ideology of collectivism with all powerful
[2:19:16.720 --> 2:19:23.280]  government at the top and uh people the serving the state at the bottom and uh that's just fine
[2:19:23.280 --> 2:19:28.640]  with them because they they know that they're in the structure either at the top or far enough
[2:19:28.640 --> 2:19:35.760]  toward the top to to have a very comfortable life while the rest of us are servants so it's
[2:19:35.760 --> 2:19:40.320]  as simple as that and the trouble is with most americans they can't imagine that there are people
[2:19:40.320 --> 2:19:45.360]  out there with that kind of a vision because it's not their vision they think there is no one that
[2:19:45.360 --> 2:19:50.960]  actually wants to rule the world but they're so wrong history shows that elites always want to
[2:19:50.960 --> 2:19:56.960]  rule the world they always dominate they always enslave but somehow the psychological idea got
[2:19:56.960 --> 2:20:03.840]  implanted that corruption doesn't exist in government friends this is big jim farmer urging

[2:24:39.120 --> 2:24:43.040]  is our guest short segment long segment coming up we're going to break down what's
[2:24:43.040 --> 2:24:47.760]  happening currently but g edward in this brief five minute segment can you give people an overview
[2:24:47.760 --> 2:24:53.920]  of say norman dodd and the reese committee the church committee carol quigley if the documents
[2:24:53.920 --> 2:24:59.440]  from the elite similar to more modern ones like eco science written by the white house science are
[2:24:59.440 --> 2:25:04.960]  where they admit planetary government and then now ban chi moon secretary general two weeks ago
[2:25:04.960 --> 2:25:11.200]  editorial in the new york times titled we can do it saying global government is here and it's
[2:25:11.200 --> 2:25:16.480]  going to be funded by carbon taxes we'll talk about that coming up but a few founding documents for
[2:25:16.480 --> 2:25:21.680]  people that want to do research yeah i think it's important to get this close to the roots of this
[2:25:21.680 --> 2:25:26.160]  as possible of course you can you can go back practically to adam and eve if you want to
[2:25:26.160 --> 2:25:33.040]  but you don't need to go that far the one of the most eye-opening documents that i discovered
[2:25:33.040 --> 2:25:39.840]  early in my research alex was uh... the testimony of a fellow by the name of norman dodd norman
[2:25:39.840 --> 2:25:48.320]  dodd this was the 1940s right after the end of world war two there was a lot of concern
[2:25:49.360 --> 2:25:55.440]  among a lot of americans and particularly some newspaper editors the hearst newspaper chain
[2:25:55.440 --> 2:26:02.800]  in particular was very concerned in writing editorials about the the uh... tax exempt
[2:26:02.800 --> 2:26:10.800]  foundations in america obviously promoting what was in those days blatant communist propaganda
[2:26:11.520 --> 2:26:15.840]  i i i found that hard to believe when i i read those editorials
[2:26:15.840 --> 2:26:20.560]  uh... but i went to the documents themselves from the tax exempt foundations and low and
[2:26:20.560 --> 2:26:26.640]  behold they were right but they were publishing essays written by a guess who joseph stalin
[2:26:26.640 --> 2:26:33.360]  and praising the glories of communism and socialism and how the end of capitalism
[2:26:33.920 --> 2:26:39.440]  was the only way for the world to go and so forth this was stuff being distributed by
[2:26:39.440 --> 2:26:45.920]  some of the largest most prestigious american tax exempt foundations and it was just amazing
[2:26:45.920 --> 2:26:50.240]  because i i hard it was hard for me to believe that would happen but there was in the historical
[2:26:50.240 --> 2:26:55.360]  record and so the hearst papers and others a lot of newspapers around the country were
[2:26:55.360 --> 2:27:01.120]  writing editorials exposing this and of course that uh... triggered a lot of alarm on the part
[2:27:01.120 --> 2:27:05.760]  of the american people and they wanted their government people in those days like today
[2:27:05.760 --> 2:27:10.000]  still thought that their government you know represented them and so they wanted their
[2:27:10.000 --> 2:27:16.240]  government to investigate this not realizing that already even in those days our own government
[2:27:16.240 --> 2:27:21.600]  was being heavily influenced by tax exempt foundations and the financial interest that
[2:27:21.600 --> 2:27:26.800]  supported them but anyway the idea was that they wanted an investigation of these tax exempt
[2:27:26.800 --> 2:27:32.960]  foundations to see if they were in fact unamerican is the word they used that they were advocating
[2:27:32.960 --> 2:27:39.680]  systems that required the destruction of the american way of life and a process using a process
[2:27:39.680 --> 2:27:45.600]  that was not uh... constitutional i mean the american system is designed to be changed if
[2:27:45.600 --> 2:27:51.520]  necessary and if it's the will of the people but there's a constitutional path for that change
[2:27:51.520 --> 2:27:55.840]  and so they were concerned about groups such as the communist party in those days
[2:27:55.840 --> 2:28:02.320]  of pursuing an unconstitutional path through the violent revolution and that sort of thing
[2:28:02.320 --> 2:28:10.720]  so there was a committee established in congress headed by congressman carol reese and i forgot
[2:28:10.720 --> 2:28:15.040]  an exact title of the committee that it's a long title but they just referred to it
[2:28:15.040 --> 2:28:21.040]  as the reese committee and its purpose was to investigate tax exempt foundations well
[2:28:21.040 --> 2:28:26.400]  that's just background what they hired a fellow by the name of uh... norman dodd to be their chief
[2:28:26.400 --> 2:28:34.560]  investigator and uh... norman dodd was uh... he came from banking circles actually excuse me
[2:28:34.560 --> 2:28:39.840]  um... he uh... he had worked for uh... some of the largest banks of new york he knew how the
[2:28:39.840 --> 2:28:44.240]  power structure worked and all of that and he was not very happy with it as a matter of fact
[2:28:44.240 --> 2:28:50.560]  he had left banking and uh... well we won't go through his career but eventually they did select
[2:28:50.560 --> 2:28:56.000]  him to be the chief investigator so now we finally get to the norman dodd testimony
[2:28:56.000 --> 2:29:02.880]  which i ran across uh... oh i guess in the middle 1960s when i was researching a lot of the
[2:29:03.600 --> 2:29:08.160]  government documents put out by the house committee on american activities
[2:29:08.160 --> 2:29:13.920]  and the senate internal security subcommittee and one of those obscure docket documents
[2:29:13.920 --> 2:29:18.800]  and believe me i had i had stacks of these things that probably if they were all put on
[2:29:18.800 --> 2:29:24.400]  top of each other would probably go eight feet at the ceiling of the house here and one of those
[2:29:24.400 --> 2:29:30.960]  obscure documents i ran across the the testimony of norman dodd and it almost knocked my socks off
[2:29:31.680 --> 2:29:37.360]  he was basically saying that when he investigated these tax exempt foundations he found out
[2:29:37.360 --> 2:29:44.880]  that there was nestled inside of them a literally a cabal of people very powerful wealthy people
[2:29:44.880 --> 2:29:49.200]  who are trying to destroy america stay there we'll be right back

[2:31:07.760 --> 2:31:12.880]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your
[2:31:12.880 --> 2:31:18.320]  electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[2:31:18.320 --> 2:31:23.440]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[2:31:23.440 --> 2:31:28.720]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[2:31:28.720 --> 2:31:33.840]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families
[2:31:33.840 --> 2:31:38.400]  lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[2:31:38.400 --> 2:31:42.960]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators

[2:34:48.160 --> 2:34:52.640]  reese committee reading of the testimony of norman dodd this high powered investigator hired by
[2:34:52.640 --> 2:34:58.400]  congress you have the actual foundation documents that we know of as the carnegie foundation the
[2:34:58.400 --> 2:35:03.280]  rockefeller foundation later the ford foundation they're now quite public about all this and i
[2:35:03.280 --> 2:35:07.920]  want you to go through the testimony first and then into modern times but here's a microcosm example
[2:35:09.040 --> 2:35:16.000]  eco barons lead the way times of london today and it says the global rich are going green as
[2:35:16.000 --> 2:35:21.840]  never before the first sunday times green rich list shows that enthusiasm among the world's wealthiest
[2:35:21.840 --> 2:35:27.280]  for investments in areas as diverse as electric cars solar power and geothermal energy is unaffected
[2:35:27.280 --> 2:35:32.480]  by recession so they always say oh it's about better cars and you know things that sound reasonable
[2:35:32.480 --> 2:35:36.880]  but when you actually read the minutes of these meetings that have been covered by the media
[2:35:36.880 --> 2:35:42.320]  it's population control how do we shut off the resources how do we destroy the industrial society
[2:35:42.320 --> 2:35:48.240]  how do we bring back a neo feudal type of serfdom to control everyone and here's another times of
[2:35:48.240 --> 2:35:54.000]  london billionaire club and bid to curb overpopulation america's rich people richest people
[2:35:54.000 --> 2:35:58.400]  meet to discuss ways of tackling disastrous environmental social and industrial threats
[2:35:58.400 --> 2:36:03.360]  and at the end of the article it says the rockefeller foundation put it on at rockefeller
[2:36:04.720 --> 2:36:10.080]  university it was secret but they told the time some of what happened and they said why all the
[2:36:10.080 --> 2:36:16.720]  secrecy they wanted to speak rich to rich without worrying anything they could and said would end
[2:36:16.720 --> 2:36:22.080]  up in the newspapers painting them as an alternative world government he said because this meeting went
[2:36:22.080 --> 2:36:27.920]  on a week before bill berg this year now you then see the rockefeller foundation as the nexus or the
[2:36:27.920 --> 2:36:32.480]  directorship and you're the expert on this i'm just telling the listeners about it of all the new
[2:36:33.440 --> 2:36:37.360]  carbon tax laws where they decide who can have a business where they decide
[2:36:37.360 --> 2:36:43.360]  what gets developed what governments fund this is the private banking cartel through government power
[2:36:44.160 --> 2:36:50.960]  in a tyrannical fashion taking complete control over society please continue yes well boy there's
[2:36:50.960 --> 2:36:57.120]  so much on that and and it all as you said earlier it goes back to the earliest beginnings
[2:36:57.120 --> 2:37:03.680]  which i'm aware where they actually talked about these strategies was uh when the tax exempt foundations
[2:37:04.800 --> 2:37:11.360]  amassed tremendous amounts of financial firepower we were talking about as you mentioned the
[2:37:11.360 --> 2:37:16.480]  Carnegie endowment fund for international peace the rockefeller foundation fund the ford foundation
[2:37:17.280 --> 2:37:24.640]  people cannot imagine the tremendous amount of money that these tax exempt foundations have
[2:37:24.640 --> 2:37:31.680]  in their bank accounts and invested in producing you know constant flow of money and they they use it
[2:37:32.320 --> 2:37:38.080]  the general impression is that they use it for philanthropic purposes but now we're talking
[2:37:38.080 --> 2:37:44.640]  about norman dodd who started to investigate these organizations and found out that under the name of
[2:37:44.640 --> 2:37:50.480]  or the cover of philanthropy they were actually doing social engineering and they're doing a
[2:37:50.480 --> 2:37:55.360]  government change and that they were trying to change the actual the characteristic of the
[2:37:55.360 --> 2:38:03.760]  american society and uh that was quite astounding and uh when i read this testimony i i just found
[2:38:03.760 --> 2:38:12.240]  it almost almost impossible to believe and so i was traveling in those days uh back to virginia
[2:38:12.960 --> 2:38:18.640]  and we had a hired a television crew and we were putting together a little documentary on
[2:38:18.640 --> 2:38:24.160]  some topic it wasn't this at all i've even forgotten the topic at the present time but i do
[2:38:24.160 --> 2:38:30.800]  know that we had a weekend uh where we had no appointments and no interviews and so i decided
[2:38:30.800 --> 2:38:36.560]  to see if i could locate norman dodd because i knew the last uh reference i had they said he lived
[2:38:36.560 --> 2:38:42.480]  in um in virginia someplace and so i just opened up the telephone directory and started to look
[2:38:42.480 --> 2:38:46.640]  through uh to see if i could find how many norman dodds there were there were only about three
[2:38:46.640 --> 2:38:55.200]  and uh so i decided to call the first one on the list it was him it was almost incredible
[2:38:55.200 --> 2:39:00.160]  good luck i said mr dodd are you the same one who was the investigator for the reese committee
[2:39:00.160 --> 2:39:06.720]  said yes that's that is uh i and i said well how wonderful i'm here i have a camera crew and
[2:39:06.720 --> 2:39:11.600]  i'm interested in your testimony would you like to speak for our cameras he said well of course
[2:39:11.600 --> 2:39:17.680]  young man of course there's many years ago and so we got him over to uh where we were staying and
[2:39:17.680 --> 2:39:24.240]  i actually captured his whole story on videotape and um it was a good thing because uh by that
[2:39:24.240 --> 2:39:29.840]  time he was advanced in years and he was not very well at all and it wasn't i think it was
[2:39:29.840 --> 2:39:35.440]  less than a year later that he passed away so we were fortunate enough to get the his testimony
[2:39:35.440 --> 2:39:42.080]  again this time spoken uh to our cameras and i had a chance to question him so i became very
[2:39:42.080 --> 2:39:47.920]  very personally familiar with his story and i might say that if anybody is interested in this
[2:39:47.920 --> 2:39:54.240]  you can find the the uh complete description of what he said and you can find even a reference to
[2:39:54.240 --> 2:40:00.720]  the to the film the documentary film which we produced based on his testimony which is called
[2:40:00.720 --> 2:40:06.160]  the hidden agenda and you can find all of that on our website in fact it's since we're talking
[2:40:06.160 --> 2:40:12.000]  about documents i think a good reference point would be to come to the freedom force website
[2:40:12.000 --> 2:40:18.960]  that's freedomforce international dot org and um when you get there to the landing page you'll see
[2:40:18.960 --> 2:40:26.240]  across the top a subsection called the issues and if you'll just navigate to the issues and at the
[2:40:26.240 --> 2:40:33.440]  bottom of that page you'll see a series of essays and references which include almost all of the
[2:40:33.440 --> 2:40:38.880]  documents that we're talking about alex including the norman dot testimony absolutely and people
[2:40:38.880 --> 2:40:43.760]  can also google norman dot in the video is out on the web but it's all the key info is there at the
[2:40:43.760 --> 2:40:50.160]  freedom force website we'll give that all out before you leave us again as well we also have
[2:40:50.160 --> 2:40:54.560]  carol quigley and i want to speak some about that and then get into what's currently happening as
[2:40:54.560 --> 2:40:59.440]  as we come down to the end game and suddenly they go from denying their plans that they were building
[2:40:59.440 --> 2:41:04.160]  behind the curtains now they're launching this warmock this juggernaut against it so they've
[2:41:04.160 --> 2:41:11.600]  unveiled it and uh they are pushing it and telling everybody uh how great it is and how wonderful it
[2:41:11.600 --> 2:41:20.640]  is and how fantastic it is uh so so let's discuss terms here because we start talking about a communist
[2:41:20.640 --> 2:41:26.160]  conspiracy people think it's a bunch of guys in black uniforms running around in russia a hundred
[2:41:26.160 --> 2:41:32.640]  years ago can you explain to people why the ultra rich always fund wealth transferring programs and
[2:41:32.640 --> 2:41:39.760]  always bill it and paint it and package it as if it's a revolution of the people and why ultra rich
[2:41:40.880 --> 2:41:45.680]  make their wealth and keep their wealth and expand their wealth through monopolies through
[2:41:45.680 --> 2:41:51.280]  collectivist governments in all their forms because people go communism why are the rich funding it
[2:41:51.280 --> 2:41:56.640]  you know why do the rich love communist china so much explain that to people yeah it's it's really
[2:41:57.440 --> 2:42:05.120]  looking at the wrong place if you're asking why the super rich uh our collectivists or gravitate
[2:42:05.120 --> 2:42:11.680]  into government it's they're really uh the rich aspect of their characteristics is not the main
[2:42:11.680 --> 2:42:18.960]  thing is their power mad people and money is one of the most important levers of power and so power
[2:42:18.960 --> 2:42:24.800]  mad people these control freaks of the uh the predator class in different ways of saying the
[2:42:24.800 --> 2:42:31.120]  same thing they they will gravitate toward any mechanism of power well that's government isn't
[2:42:31.120 --> 2:42:37.280]  it if you can control the levers of governmental power you can really control the population
[2:42:37.280 --> 2:42:43.840]  and you can have all the money so it's it's kind of a it's a merger and they can pretend to be uh
[2:42:44.400 --> 2:42:49.360]  collectivists on the left or collectivists on the right it makes no difference right and left
[2:42:49.360 --> 2:42:56.560]  wings are merely two wings of the same ugly bird which is collectivism and like any wings on a bird
[2:42:56.560 --> 2:43:03.280]  they'll flap against each other in order to fly uh you need both wings to fly so this is the appearance
[2:43:03.280 --> 2:43:09.760]  of conflict uh so that politically speaking all the dumb dumps down at the bottom at the bottom
[2:43:09.760 --> 2:43:15.920]  of this uh a mechanism think that they're you know participating in their own political destiny
[2:43:15.920 --> 2:43:21.600]  because they can go to the polls and they can vote the rascals out and vote republican this time oh
[2:43:21.600 --> 2:43:27.040]  we don't like that we'll go vote democrat the next time and the two wings beat against each other
[2:43:27.040 --> 2:43:33.280]  and the bird flies and uh so that's true not only in our country but it's true around the world
[2:43:33.280 --> 2:43:39.200]  and it's true through much of modern history that the conflict that the big major conflicts of the
[2:43:39.200 --> 2:43:45.520]  world of which we're familiar world war one world war two and the conflict that's goes goes on today
[2:43:45.520 --> 2:43:51.760]  which i would call world war three it's now going on is is a conflict to a large extent between
[2:43:51.760 --> 2:43:57.840]  two branches of world collectivism
[2:44:00.560 --> 2:44:06.240]  okay we had our customary phone drop so we're going to uh get g ever griffin back on effect
[2:44:06.240 --> 2:44:10.640]  let's just have genesis do it give give genesis his phone number and we'll just go with the genesis
[2:44:10.640 --> 2:44:17.600]  phone system and test that out that way again g ever griffin is our guest today
[2:44:17.600 --> 2:44:24.800]  today and uh while we're getting g ever griffin back on the line uh again i'll just point out
[2:44:24.800 --> 2:44:30.960]  that he is in the film fall of the republic fall of the republic america's last stand
[2:44:30.960 --> 2:44:34.720]  make the choice liberty or tyranny fall the republic documents have an offshore corporate
[2:44:34.720 --> 2:44:40.080]  cartel is bankrupting the u.s economy by design leaders are now declaring that world
[2:44:40.080 --> 2:44:43.680]  government has arrived and that the dollar will be replaced with the new global currency
[2:44:43.680 --> 2:44:49.440]  economy president obama has recently violated article one section nine of the u.s constitution
[2:44:49.440 --> 2:44:53.520]  by seating himself at the head of the united nation security council thus becoming the
[2:44:53.520 --> 2:44:58.000]  first u.s president to chair the world body a sign of a dictatorship is in its final stages
[2:44:58.000 --> 2:45:04.080]  of completion and laws protecting basic human rights are now being abolished worldwide an iron
[2:45:04.080 --> 2:45:08.480]  curtain of high-tech tyranny is now descending over the planet a worldwide regime controlled by
[2:45:08.480 --> 2:45:13.840]  an unelected corporate elite uh is implementing a planetary carbon tax system that will dominate
[2:45:13.840 --> 2:45:19.040]  all human activity and establish a system of neo feudal slavery the image makers have carefully
[2:45:19.040 --> 2:45:23.920]  packaged obama is the world's savior he is the trojan horse manufactured to pacify the people
[2:45:23.920 --> 2:45:28.880]  just long enough for the globalist to complete their master plan the film reveals the architecture
[2:45:28.880 --> 2:45:33.840]  of the new world order and what the power elite have in store for humanity more importantly it
[2:45:33.840 --> 2:45:38.480]  communicates how we the people can retake our government turn the criminal tide and bring the
[2:45:38.480 --> 2:45:45.200]  tyrants to justice fall the republic available on dvd at info wars dot com okay going back to g
[2:45:45.200 --> 2:45:51.360]  edward griffin our line drop to you uh continue where uh you left off sir yeah i'm i don't know
[2:45:51.360 --> 2:45:55.040]  what happened is all of a sudden i was talking to a dead phone but anyway it was probably the
[2:45:55.040 --> 2:46:00.320]  universe speaking to me because i realized i was digressing from your initial question
[2:46:00.320 --> 2:46:05.600]  which is why do these people always uh uh you know gravitate toward government
[2:46:05.600 --> 2:46:11.200]  and that the the the word that was used was the super rich or the very rich well actually you
[2:46:11.200 --> 2:46:18.720]  know in the beginning of this country america surpassed the rest of the world through a very
[2:46:18.720 --> 2:46:24.160]  simple principle it's called free enterprise competition and uh under those conditions
[2:46:24.160 --> 2:46:29.200]  uh people compete they uh they produce the best product and service they possibly can at the lowest
[2:46:29.200 --> 2:46:36.800]  possible price and um this leads to great systems of efficiency and productivity and that in my view
[2:46:36.800 --> 2:46:44.080]  is what made america so great because we came from a virtual wilderness uh europe was already
[2:46:44.080 --> 2:46:50.560]  far ahead of us but we bypassed europe because of free enterprise competition well then about
[2:46:50.560 --> 2:46:58.400]  toward the end of the 1800s um these very wealthy people uh who had become the captains of industry
[2:46:58.400 --> 2:47:03.280]  as they like to call them you know the rockefellers and the carnagies and so forth had already reached
[2:47:03.280 --> 2:47:09.520]  great um uh fortunes acquired great fortunes and decided that competition was no longer
[2:47:09.520 --> 2:47:15.360]  in their best interest and they began to look for ways to eliminate competition in fact uh
[2:47:15.360 --> 2:47:22.320]  john d rockefeller said it best uh he's quoted by all of his biographers he said competition is a
[2:47:22.320 --> 2:47:26.560]  sin well of course it's a sin if you're at the top of the pyramid and you don't want anybody
[2:47:26.560 --> 2:47:31.680]  competing with you because you're already in first place then you then you say competition is
[2:47:31.680 --> 2:47:39.680]  a sin and from that period of history about the 1880s on there was a rather substantial and rapid
[2:47:39.680 --> 2:47:45.840]  change in the way americans did business instead of free enterprise competition they began to
[2:47:46.800 --> 2:47:53.600]  coalesce into uh cartels and form monopolies and to go into partnership with government
[2:47:53.600 --> 2:48:00.720]  to pass laws always in the name of protecting the people but laws which in reality uh eliminated
[2:48:00.720 --> 2:48:08.000]  competition and was able to throw competitive advantage in the direction of those with political
[2:48:08.000 --> 2:48:14.960]  influence and so we saw a change in the way people became rich it used to be they became rich by
[2:48:14.960 --> 2:48:21.680]  competing and by producing goods and services and then by the 1900s they became rich by um not
[2:48:21.680 --> 2:48:30.720]  competing and instead using their prowess and their expertise to buy politicians to create laws
[2:48:30.720 --> 2:48:35.760]  that would eliminate their competition and give them unfair advantage and so then that's how
[2:48:35.760 --> 2:48:41.440]  that's how we see the big bankers publicly funding fascism and communism now declassified
[2:48:41.440 --> 2:48:46.960]  that hitler and miscellany were mi5 and we're basically set up i mean this is the sophistication
[2:48:46.960 --> 2:48:53.760]  of the milner group and this british model this imperial model of hiding your your your true
[2:48:53.760 --> 2:49:01.600]  government behind frontmen and so elites can come in and have the government give them the power to
[2:49:01.600 --> 2:49:06.960]  issue currency and credit and buy up the planet but still some people don't want to sell so now you
[2:49:06.960 --> 2:49:12.720]  pass big environmental laws which the rockefellers admit they founded which they also founded the
[2:49:12.720 --> 2:49:19.040]  worldwide acceptance of eugenics over a hundred years ago as you know the rock stars were scientists
[2:49:19.040 --> 2:49:24.080]  and these elites were smart they financed most the scientists and they said come up with systems
[2:49:24.080 --> 2:49:29.840]  of social control to divide and conquer people to dumb them down to take over government to
[2:49:29.840 --> 2:49:37.600]  centralize control to take over education to render the public uh weak and impotent against us
[2:49:37.600 --> 2:49:44.160]  as bertrand russell said through social engineering that the elite finance at his own words a rebellion
[2:49:44.160 --> 2:49:49.680]  by the lower classes or the proles as he called us using communist terminology though he worked for
[2:49:49.680 --> 2:49:56.800]  the big money banks it was mi uh six himself and os s before that nobel prize winner he said a rebellion
[2:49:56.800 --> 2:50:04.160]  by the proles will be as unthinkable as a rebellion of sheep against the practice of eating mutton
[2:50:04.160 --> 2:50:09.120]  or sheep is what mutton means for those that don't know so they're saying we're blind dumb sheep
[2:50:09.120 --> 2:50:13.360]  that sheep don't rebel against their owner when they're getting slaughtered do they g edward
[2:50:13.360 --> 2:50:18.800]  well no and cattle don't and a lot of all those domesticated animals don't and now we're back
[2:50:18.800 --> 2:50:23.680]  to norman don because what he discovered when he was talking with the heads of these tax exempt
[2:50:23.680 --> 2:50:31.440]  foundations is that they were laying a master plan which was had as its goal how to make the
[2:50:31.440 --> 2:50:38.160]  population of america docile like cattle and sheep and how to get them to accept all of these things
[2:50:38.160 --> 2:50:43.520]  without complaining without complaining and the strategy they came up with was absolutely
[2:50:43.520 --> 2:50:47.840]  brilliant stay there we're going to talk about that strategy on the other side then bring it
[2:50:47.840 --> 2:50:54.240]  forward to current times and then the future with g edward greffin i'm alex jones this is the gcn

[2:55:33.840 --> 2:55:38.080]  yes and just before the break we were talking about the strategy the fact that this is not an
[2:55:38.080 --> 2:55:46.400]  accident uh this is not new this is the foundation for this was laid in strategic form oh well at
[2:55:46.400 --> 2:55:50.800]  the turn of the last century but we were talking about norman dot i keep coming back to him because
[2:55:50.800 --> 2:55:56.320]  i think there's so much to be learned from his testimony and and basically when he went and
[2:55:56.320 --> 2:56:02.640]  he talked to the head of the ford foundation the kind of the name of gayther i think was his name
[2:56:02.640 --> 2:56:09.680]  and he said mr gayther uh i would like very much to know what you folks are doing here
[2:56:10.240 --> 2:56:16.000]  and he said without any hesitation gayther said well mr dodd i can tell you exactly what we're
[2:56:16.000 --> 2:56:23.360]  doing here he said that we are putting our resources to work so as to change the united
[2:56:23.360 --> 2:56:29.520]  states of america so it can be comfortably merged with the soviet union those were his
[2:56:29.520 --> 2:56:34.960]  exact words and and dodd said he almost fell off of his chair when he heard that and he said it wasn't
[2:56:34.960 --> 2:56:39.680]  just the soviet union it wasn't that it was communism that they wanted but the fact was if
[2:56:39.680 --> 2:56:44.640]  you could merge the united states with the soviet union which was at the opposite end that people
[2:56:44.640 --> 2:56:49.200]  thought of the political spectrum why you could merge it with any nation and that was the real
[2:56:49.200 --> 2:56:54.320]  goal because they were trying to set up a merger process in which the united states would be merged
[2:56:54.320 --> 2:57:02.000]  with the soviet union red china um france england germany you know the world and um
[2:57:02.800 --> 2:57:08.320]  he said well how can you do that and he got the answer of when he visited the offices
[2:57:08.320 --> 2:57:15.680]  of the um karnige endowment fund for international peace he said um you can take a look at our
[2:57:15.680 --> 2:57:21.280]  minute books and you can see what we do here and the answer came here's here's the answer the strategy
[2:57:21.280 --> 2:57:27.680]  that i'm finally building to they said the american people will never surrender their affinity to their
[2:57:28.240 --> 2:57:34.400]  legal system their customs their traditions you know none of that the people are in america are
[2:57:34.400 --> 2:57:42.320]  different and they'll never give up any of that unless unless they're frightened into it if they
[2:57:42.320 --> 2:57:48.560]  thought that it was necessary in order to survive then they will give up everything because survival
[2:57:48.560 --> 2:57:54.960]  is the most basic instinct of all human beings and so therefore if you're going to change life in
[2:57:54.960 --> 2:58:01.120]  the united states so it can be comfortably merged with the soviet union and any other totalitarian
[2:58:01.120 --> 2:58:06.640]  system in the world you must make the united states a totalitarian system and the way to do
[2:58:06.640 --> 2:58:12.880]  that is to scare the people by getting them embroiled into wars and this is the amazing part
[2:58:12.880 --> 2:58:18.960]  then the karnige endowment fund for peace then plotted to get the united states into world war
[2:58:18.960 --> 2:58:25.040]  one and to prolong it and they said if you can get the american people into war and be afraid of
[2:58:25.040 --> 2:58:31.840]  their survival they will accept a totalitarian government so let's be clear it is on record
[2:58:31.840 --> 2:58:37.120]  in the congressional record the foundations admit they started world war one and world war two to get
[2:58:37.120 --> 2:58:46.000]  the un and the world government they are the warmongers thank you for listening to gcm be sure
[2:58:46.000 --> 2:58:55.840]  to visit gcmlive.com today hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[2:58:55.840 --> 2:59:01.920]  this is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling
[2:59:01.920 --> 2:59:07.120]  the rug from underneath the americans at home i have turned a tremendous influence on our president
[2:59:07.120 --> 2:59:13.040]  in congress and they really are calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all of us
[2:59:13.040 --> 2:59:18.720]  as american citizens to pay attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[2:59:18.720 --> 2:59:24.720]  the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[2:59:24.720 --> 2:59:29.440]  world government tim geithner, bernanke, their arsonists, they're asking for more matches
[2:59:29.440 --> 2:59:34.000]  and the congress is saying who do we make the check out to today seems like nobody does care
[2:59:34.000 --> 2:59:40.720]  and right now in washington dc we have seen a fall of the republic get your copy of fall of the
[2:59:40.720 --> 2:59:48.000]  republic on dvd at info wars dot com we're watching online right now in super high quality at prison
[2:59:48.000 --> 3:00:03.920]  planet dot tv waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio network
[3:00:03.920 --> 3:00:19.200]  now into the fourth and final hour gebert griffin is our guest thank you for joining us
[3:00:19.200 --> 3:00:26.800]  he's breaking down the embryonic development of this world government that is to be captained and
[3:00:26.800 --> 3:00:34.400]  controlled and piloted by a handful of ultra rich elite families intermarried with the royalty of
[3:00:34.400 --> 3:00:41.360]  europe the rothschilds the rockefellers all the usual names and you could ignore gebert griffin
[3:00:41.360 --> 3:00:47.520]  30 40 50 years ago when he had all the documents people could say oh you know i'm not gonna look
[3:00:47.520 --> 3:00:54.800]  at those but now it's openly being announced gebert griffin please continue and then let's get into
[3:00:54.800 --> 3:01:01.440]  why they're now announcing it what that means in the current situation what does it signify that
[3:01:01.440 --> 3:01:06.240]  they're now emerging and admitting that it's going to be a private world government that
[3:01:06.240 --> 3:01:11.440]  has complete control over every facet of our lives no bill of rights no constitution no
[3:01:11.440 --> 3:01:17.600]  parental rights children to be raised in government dormitories i mean just hell is being announced
[3:01:17.600 --> 3:01:25.440]  well my initial reaction to that question is is not a very optimistic reaction i i think honestly
[3:01:25.440 --> 3:01:31.200]  that they feel that it's so close now that you uh you need to talk about it and condition
[3:01:31.200 --> 3:01:36.320]  the american mind into accepting it as a reality there comes a point when you say hey here it is
[3:01:36.320 --> 3:01:40.960]  i get used to it and i think they've come to that phase and and the historical development
[3:01:40.960 --> 3:01:46.080]  that they're telling us just to get used to it uh also i think it's partly because after all of
[3:01:46.080 --> 3:01:53.200]  these years uh very few people are indignant about it anymore i mean there was a time uh
[3:01:53.920 --> 3:02:02.160]  20 30 40 years ago when the mere mention of what's happening today as a possibility you'd probably
[3:02:02.160 --> 3:02:07.280]  not just be laughed down but you'd probably be uh you'd be squirted with tars and feathers because
[3:02:07.280 --> 3:02:11.760]  you'd it would sound like you were speaking against america you know people did not want to hear that
[3:02:11.760 --> 3:02:16.880]  that's absurd that's not considerate and so forth well now uh people say oh yeah well we all know
[3:02:16.880 --> 3:02:21.680]  that yeah yeah well well yeah we've had to give up our freedom in order to protect ourselves
[3:02:21.680 --> 3:02:26.720]  against the nazis in world war two and now we've had to give up more freedom to protect ourselves
[3:02:26.720 --> 3:02:31.600]  against the terrorists in world war three and yes we have to give up our freedom to protect
[3:02:31.600 --> 3:02:36.400]  ourselves against swine flu and we have to give up our freedom in order to protect ourselves
[3:02:36.400 --> 3:02:41.680]  against an economic collapse and all that formula that they talked about in those days is keeps coming
[3:02:41.680 --> 3:02:47.040]  to haunt us is that everybody is afraid of this that and the other thing and they each time they
[3:02:47.040 --> 3:02:51.440]  think about their fear they give up more freedom and so now they're kind of conditioned to this
[3:02:51.440 --> 3:02:56.400]  idea well yeah we did that that was we did it consciously and here we are now what's next
[3:02:56.400 --> 3:03:02.080]  i think more people are more concerned today knowing what's next than being indignant about
[3:03:02.080 --> 3:03:08.960]  what's now there's a capitulation a broke backed just giving in to whatever happens
[3:03:08.960 --> 3:03:15.040]  and really going along with it but there is a larger and larger minority that is awake and is
[3:03:15.040 --> 3:03:20.080]  upset but but but going back to what you said before the break that in their own documents
[3:03:20.080 --> 3:03:26.640]  and i had a high school teacher that talked about this in their own carnegie documents clearly
[3:03:26.640 --> 3:03:31.280]  that's the one of the central foundations the center of the spoke with the Rockefeller foundation
[3:03:31.280 --> 3:03:36.640]  from all my research you can add to that if you'd like but that they created these wars
[3:03:36.640 --> 3:03:42.400]  and finance the boogeyman the Saddam Hussein's the bin laden's the Hitler's the Mussolini's
[3:03:43.600 --> 3:03:50.080]  the in top the linens and it's in mainline history but just not popularly advertised
[3:03:50.080 --> 3:03:56.720]  that this is what they did and now they're making humanity the enemy is the cfr and club of room
[3:03:56.720 --> 3:04:02.000]  documents have stayed in the last 10 years they openly admit the environmental movements fake
[3:04:02.000 --> 3:04:08.240]  they openly admit that that's a pretext to make everyone an enemy everyone someone bad that the
[3:04:08.240 --> 3:04:13.760]  government has to come after and that terrorism makes everyone a potential enemy and the flu anyone
[3:04:13.760 --> 3:04:21.040]  could have it so i mean this is tyranny this is how america dies well there's no question about it
[3:04:21.040 --> 3:04:27.520]  i i guess i haven't seen them openly admit this so much but they certainly are talking about it
[3:04:27.520 --> 3:04:33.680]  as though it's it's a fate to complete it's already here so we don't have to sell anybody on the idea
[3:04:33.680 --> 3:04:38.080]  hey it's already happened folks you know get used to it i think what do you mean you don't see them
[3:04:38.080 --> 3:04:44.400]  openly i mean i mean cfr reports ban chi moon in the new york times two weeks ago saying global
[3:04:44.400 --> 3:04:49.680]  government al gore saying global government saying that the imf will be the new bank of the world we
[3:04:49.680 --> 3:04:54.640]  pay carbon taxes to oh no i see that but what i what i don't see is them admitting that they're
[3:04:54.640 --> 3:05:00.960]  using deceit and trickery that's so they're still keeping that pretty much under wraps oh hey folks

[3:08:20.080 --> 3:08:27.920]  texas alex jones g edward i'm gonna start taking calls in the next segment and also get into
[3:08:27.920 --> 3:08:34.000]  solutions with you but you've got the floor break down their system of crisis creation
[3:08:34.000 --> 3:08:40.000]  what's currently happening with the carbon tax the government health care the banks it's come out
[3:08:40.000 --> 3:08:44.000]  even in the clatchy news service that golden sacks imploded the housing market on purpose
[3:08:44.640 --> 3:08:48.320]  engineered it to destroy their competition to get the bailouts and hoard the money
[3:08:48.320 --> 3:08:56.080]  the golden sacks of course is the inner group that pilots the federal reserve system and that
[3:08:56.080 --> 3:09:01.840]  also holds the federal regulatory positions in almost every agency two three four deep
[3:09:02.640 --> 3:09:08.400]  and and where we're going with this system what the world is going to look like in a decade 20
[3:09:08.400 --> 3:09:14.960]  years if they succeed from the research so what they're doing currently and then what the world
[3:09:14.960 --> 3:09:19.840]  will look like if they succeed gebert griffin you've got the floor all the way out to the next
[3:09:19.840 --> 3:09:26.720]  break well that's uh that's quite a topic uh as a matter of fact i've started to put a series of
[3:09:26.720 --> 3:09:32.480]  seminars on the road alex called a crash course on money and uh before i forget it that we just
[3:09:32.480 --> 3:09:39.200]  decided the other evening to come to austin on december 12 so uh we'll talk about that later
[3:09:39.200 --> 3:09:45.680]  but anyway the crash course on money is a full day seminar and i devoted a lot of time to answering
[3:09:45.680 --> 3:09:51.120]  just the question that you've raised where are we going and what can we do about it uh well
[3:09:51.120 --> 3:09:57.120]  in a nutshell uh anybody that listens to your program has got a pretty good idea we're going
[3:09:57.120 --> 3:10:03.600]  to a complete command economy uh we're the free market what's left of it today it will be completely
[3:10:03.600 --> 3:10:09.760]  dead i'm not predicting that this must happen i'm saying that if there are no changes if we
[3:10:09.760 --> 3:10:14.480]  continue going in the direction that we're headed we're going to reach where we're headed that's all
[3:10:14.480 --> 3:10:20.640]  and we're headed right toward a command economy that's no different substantially than the command
[3:10:20.640 --> 3:10:28.400]  economy of the old soviet union or the uh red china or any of the or nazi germany and in other
[3:10:28.400 --> 3:10:35.120]  words um prices are will be completely controlled employment will be completely controlled uh
[3:10:36.480 --> 3:10:42.320]  you know your complete dependence for your food your shelter your health care your education
[3:10:42.320 --> 3:10:49.040]  everything that's important will be provided uh and regulated by the masters in washington dc
[3:10:49.040 --> 3:10:54.560]  and people will be grateful or told they're supposed to be grateful to be taken care of
[3:10:54.560 --> 3:10:59.600]  and in return for that of course they must be very good boys and girls and do exactly as they're
[3:10:59.600 --> 3:11:04.240]  told otherwise they'll be cut off and they won't have that food shelter and health care and all
[3:11:04.240 --> 3:11:10.720]  of that sort of thing it's it's a very dismal picture it's a high-tech feudalism and it's
[3:11:10.720 --> 3:11:16.400]  definitely in our future and not our distant future i might say if things continue as they are
[3:11:16.400 --> 3:11:21.200]  so uh what can you do about that well there's nothing you can do about it except to change
[3:11:21.200 --> 3:11:26.960]  the direction that we're headed you can't just say well what should we invest in you know that
[3:11:26.960 --> 3:11:32.560]  that might help a little bit it might get you a few weeks or months down the line with a little
[3:11:32.560 --> 3:11:37.600]  bit of independence but when the jack boots show up and say into the truck that's the end of the
[3:11:37.600 --> 3:11:44.480]  line investments are not so we've got to change the system and uh of course we're i i'm always
[3:11:44.480 --> 3:11:49.040]  talking about freedom for us international when i start thinking about changing the system
[3:11:49.040 --> 3:11:54.880]  recapturing the system but uh uh how can you protect yourself in the meantime there's a short
[3:11:54.880 --> 3:12:02.160]  term view and a long term view people are naturally concerned about that short term view and uh you
[3:12:02.160 --> 3:12:07.600]  know you've got a lot of your sponsors on your program that i think have excellent solutions for
[3:12:07.600 --> 3:12:14.080]  short term uh survival if you will uh sure we ought to have food we ought to have uh good
[3:12:14.080 --> 3:12:20.080]  drinking water or have power uh electrical power at our disposal we ought to have uh
[3:12:20.080 --> 3:12:26.800]  gold and silver something that will will uh be readily accepted by almost everybody when it comes
[3:12:26.800 --> 3:12:34.960]  time to replace the electronic uh money system that probably will be completely collapsed at one
[3:12:34.960 --> 3:12:40.000]  point so yeah those are things you can do for the short term but the long term the only thing that
[3:12:40.000 --> 3:12:46.880]  will work is to recapture the system and uh then we start and in the seminar we'll be talking about
[3:12:46.880 --> 3:12:53.120]  this thing of revolution versus uh revolt and that's quite an interesting topic because
[3:12:53.120 --> 3:12:59.840]  i don't think many people have considered the difference uh there's a rising uh uh energy
[3:12:59.840 --> 3:13:06.880]  for resistance today people are angry and as uh that television or i guess it's not television
[3:13:06.880 --> 3:13:11.440]  it was a movie i can't think of the name of a network i guess it was the guy says you know
[3:13:11.440 --> 3:13:15.520]  we're mad as hell and we ain't going to take it no more or whatever he says well that's the kind
[3:13:15.520 --> 3:13:20.240]  of the the mood of the american people we're mad we're not going to take it anymore but the idea
[3:13:20.240 --> 3:13:25.040]  that you just get mad and not take it anymore is going to make a difference no they don't care about
[3:13:25.040 --> 3:13:32.160]  that uh the elitists have been anticipating years years in advance for uh some kind of an uprising
[3:13:32.160 --> 3:13:38.400]  uh they uh they've been building FEMA camps for that they've been uh equipping the local police
[3:13:38.400 --> 3:13:45.440]  in crowd control and they've been developing weapons just specifically for for uh demonstrators and
[3:13:45.440 --> 3:13:51.600]  crowds of people and rioters and so forth they they know it's coming and in my opinion i think
[3:13:51.600 --> 3:13:57.680]  they wanted to come which is a frightening thing because i think they want people out making all
[3:13:57.680 --> 3:14:03.680]  of this ruckus so they can have a good excuse to uh institute marshal law and round up everybody
[3:14:03.680 --> 3:14:09.120]  including uh those who aren't even on the streets uh people who maybe are sitting in their radio
[3:14:09.120 --> 3:14:17.280]  studios doing talk shows and uh so they i think they want that kind of violence but um one of
[3:14:17.280 --> 3:14:22.320]  the things we'll be talking about is the difference between a revolt and a revolution basically it's
[3:14:22.320 --> 3:14:31.600]  this revolts are just a uprising of people with no leadership no strategy no goal no organization no
[3:14:31.600 --> 3:14:36.960]  funding no communications just a bunch of people that say i've i've had it and i'm not going to
[3:14:36.960 --> 3:14:42.160]  take it anymore and they wind up in the streets with the rocks and stones and sticks or whatever
[3:14:42.160 --> 3:14:49.440]  they've got and um it'd be like the hungarian revolt back in the 60s um revolts never work
[3:14:49.440 --> 3:14:56.480]  they may be successful for a day or two create a lot of euphoria on the part of the participants
[3:14:56.480 --> 3:15:03.440]  because they're able to face down uh established military control merely with their sheer numbers
[3:15:03.440 --> 3:15:09.440]  but after a little while the it it dissipates it goes away they don't have resources they don't
[3:15:09.440 --> 3:15:14.480]  have food they don't have water they don't have leadership communications and all those things
[3:15:14.480 --> 3:15:21.360]  and the and the revolt gradually just dissipates and no revolt of history has ever been successful
[3:15:21.360 --> 3:15:26.160]  in the long run revolutions on the other hand often are successful but that's because they're
[3:15:26.160 --> 3:15:31.360]  quite different from revolts they have all of the things that revolts don't have they do have
[3:15:31.360 --> 3:15:37.680]  leadership and strategy and financing and communications and especially they have military
[3:15:37.680 --> 3:15:44.080]  training and military units already in place uh it's quite different and all you need to do
[3:15:44.080 --> 3:15:50.000]  is take a look at the american revolution and you can see immediately that that was not a revolt
[3:15:50.720 --> 3:15:56.720]  that was a revolution we had 13 governments that came together they were complete governments
[3:15:56.720 --> 3:16:02.320]  they had their leadership they had taxes they had courts they had representation they had
[3:16:02.320 --> 3:16:07.520]  military units they had armories with ammunition they had training and military training and
[3:16:07.520 --> 3:16:15.440]  discipline and 13 governments came together and unified and stood up against the government of
[3:16:15.440 --> 3:16:21.200]  the crown of england had they just been farmers with pitchforks or muskets there's no way in the
[3:16:21.200 --> 3:16:27.680]  world they could have successfully stood up against king george but they were organized and so they
[3:16:27.680 --> 3:16:33.120]  really created a revolution so now we look at today and all these people running around say
[3:16:33.120 --> 3:16:38.640]  well we're it's about time to have a revolution they have no idea what they're talking about
[3:16:38.640 --> 3:16:43.920]  and if you listen to those people i think it's going to be a great tragedy for the american
[3:16:43.920 --> 3:16:49.120]  to fall for it be one of the greatest bloodbaths of all history i'm afraid well g edward we see
[3:16:49.120 --> 3:16:54.320]  the provocateurs online with websites and commenting we can track who they are in many
[3:16:54.320 --> 3:16:59.760]  cases it comes out later they were fbi informants they're always calling for shooting and killing
[3:16:59.760 --> 3:17:05.600]  and war and they always go around saying alex jones is a coward he's not calling for killing cops
[3:17:05.600 --> 3:17:11.120]  in military and i say that person's got to be a fed or they'd be arrested and then years later it
[3:17:11.120 --> 3:17:18.560]  comes out they're all feds on record in court uh it's just unbelievable that's why the federal
[3:17:18.560 --> 3:17:24.240]  government stages terror attacks like oklahoma city in 911 they need to make themselves the victims
[3:17:24.240 --> 3:17:29.920]  they need to have offensive attacks against themselves to have the illusion that they're
[3:17:29.920 --> 3:17:35.840]  not the aggressor because in common sense humanity people know that an aggressor is the person that
[3:17:35.840 --> 3:17:46.240]  is in the wrong and so uh as we expand down this road uh it it's it's obvious anybody saying you're
[3:17:46.240 --> 3:17:51.120]  a coward you're not calling for violence you notice they're not marching out and carrying out the
[3:17:51.120 --> 3:17:55.040]  violence now that doesn't mean that we don't defensively protect ourselves in the second
[3:17:55.040 --> 3:17:59.200]  amendment is something that's been holding back the tyranny because they know it would go badly
[3:17:59.200 --> 3:18:04.560]  for them if they go on the offensive against us so the question for the controllers is how do they
[3:18:04.560 --> 3:18:11.280]  go on the offensive against the people of the world uh without uh looking like the aggressors
[3:18:11.280 --> 3:18:16.720]  and so that's why they use terrorism and the environment and all these systems that make
[3:18:16.720 --> 3:18:23.520]  the individual bad and that colors everyone as a potential bad guy and the airports tsa admits
[3:18:23.520 --> 3:18:29.680]  that's training for nationwide on the streets and schools and at the colleges and at the hospitals
[3:18:29.680 --> 3:18:34.560]  and the shopping malls where we're all searched and randomly lined up on the side of the street and
[3:18:34.560 --> 3:18:40.000]  put through body scanners england's about five years ahead of us as you know and they're doing the
[3:18:40.000 --> 3:18:44.640]  exact same thing they are they are bringing in tyranny they're saying parents have to have a
[3:18:44.640 --> 3:18:50.320]  license to have kids and be with them in public to prove they're not pedophiles 20 000 homes
[3:18:50.320 --> 3:18:55.200]  with newborn babies have cameras in the homes watching them to make sure their good parents
[3:18:55.200 --> 3:19:00.400]  guilty until proven innocent and when i ask you about their future operation i've read their
[3:19:00.400 --> 3:19:06.160]  documents i know what their future operation is if they win i just wanted your perspective and view
[3:19:06.160 --> 3:19:11.520]  on that because they say they're going to raise people outside the home first it'll start with
[3:19:11.520 --> 3:19:15.760]  year-round school then they'll come in a session home and say you don't have enough money to have
[3:19:15.760 --> 3:19:21.120]  kids your kids will now live in a government facility not just kids at the cps grabs but
[3:19:21.120 --> 3:19:25.840]  everybody's children how will they take the middle classes money through property tax how
[3:19:25.840 --> 3:19:31.520]  are they going to break us down incrementally till we're fully institutionalized all of
[3:19:31.520 --> 3:19:37.120]  his prisoners that was the point i wanted you to get into yeah well it sounds like a little
[3:19:37.120 --> 3:19:41.840]  music in the background there meaning the end of the session the end of this segment we're

[3:24:38.640 --> 3:24:45.360]  G. Edward Griffin is our guest your phone call is coming up in the next segment at 1-800-259-9231
[3:24:45.360 --> 3:24:52.560]  this scientific dictatorship the final revolution as the elites have called it
[3:24:53.440 --> 3:24:59.120]  is a scientific tyranny based on psychology anthropology human activity public relations
[3:24:59.120 --> 3:25:05.840]  propaganda to bring in this tyranny world government is only the beginning what comes
[3:25:05.840 --> 3:25:12.000]  once they have their world government because you talk about them running our lives and and
[3:25:12.000 --> 3:25:18.720]  providing everything you mean providing euthanasia you mean providing execution you mean providing
[3:25:18.720 --> 3:25:24.480]  starvation I mean they're they're in game once they have their global straight jacket in place
[3:25:24.480 --> 3:25:29.040]  which they're putting the final tweaks on right now what comes next from your research G. Edward
[3:25:29.040 --> 3:25:39.120]  Griffin my opinion Alex is that we have a gravitation into this this power center this huge
[3:25:39.120 --> 3:25:44.400]  concentration of power now globally we have a gravitation in there of the greatest
[3:25:46.000 --> 3:25:53.440]  criminal minds of the planet at the moment this is the predator class attracted to that power
[3:25:54.000 --> 3:25:59.440]  these are the people running the show who outside of government would probably be on death row
[3:26:00.080 --> 3:26:04.560]  they certainly be in prison because they'd be committing all of the most horrendous crimes
[3:26:04.560 --> 3:26:10.240]  against their fellow man that you can imagine but they've gone into government so that they can
[3:26:10.240 --> 3:26:16.960]  be the ones who put other people in prison and it's it's it's as simple as that we're looking
[3:26:16.960 --> 3:26:24.480]  at the formation of a huge criminal syndicate and so if you understand the mentality of the
[3:26:24.480 --> 3:26:31.680]  criminal mind then you can see what it is they have planned what do criminals do they want to
[3:26:31.680 --> 3:26:38.160]  exploit everybody else they want to make them serve them they want to take everything of value
[3:26:38.160 --> 3:26:45.440]  from them it's it's it that's simple I think that in some cases these people may have started out
[3:26:45.440 --> 3:26:51.280]  with some idealism and because they thought that you know collectivism was a good idea
[3:26:51.840 --> 3:26:57.440]  because they thought that would put an end to war but very simply and very quickly they understood
[3:26:57.440 --> 3:27:03.520]  that in order to bring collectivism into fruition around the world they have to have wars and they
[3:27:03.520 --> 3:27:08.800]  become the greatest instigators of wars and all the injustices that they claim that they want
[3:27:08.800 --> 3:27:14.560]  to correct they become the the instigators of those injustices so I think soon they become
[3:27:14.560 --> 3:27:21.360]  very callous to the human condition and it just boils down to a position of who's got the power
[3:27:21.360 --> 3:27:27.680]  and who will rule and who will serve so use your imagination you can see the ultimate
[3:27:27.680 --> 3:27:33.920]  uh servitude coming in the future where people will be nothing but little ciphers and they
[3:27:33.920 --> 3:27:39.360]  will completely serve their masters and if they don't serve well they will be exterminated it's
[3:27:39.360 --> 3:27:49.200]  that simple absolutely uh gee edward griffin expanding on that for people that don't understand
[3:27:49.200 --> 3:27:54.720]  the grave danger we're in isn't tyranny what we see 99 percent of the time in history black
[3:27:54.720 --> 3:28:01.600]  uniforms mass arrests death poverty the elites love to sit up on their pleasure mountains
[3:28:01.600 --> 3:28:07.920]  in their palaces with all their power and sex and and and and wars it's all about their power
[3:28:07.920 --> 3:28:14.480]  trip and everyone else toiling under uh poverty the globalists admitted many of their own statements
[3:28:14.480 --> 3:28:21.600]  they use poverty as a weapon to suppress people and they enjoy riding past in their armored chariots
[3:28:21.600 --> 3:28:27.200]  the rotting hovels and starving children to them children would snot all over their faces with
[3:28:27.200 --> 3:28:33.360]  their rib cages sticking out as beautiful because that makes their feathered beds and their servants
[3:28:33.360 --> 3:28:41.200]  that much more enjoyable you know alexa years ago uh i came across a quotation from uh lennon
[3:28:41.200 --> 3:28:47.840]  that addressed this issue and lennon uh was answering the question do they have bread lines
[3:28:47.840 --> 3:28:52.400]  in russia in the soviet union in those days this is of course we have bread lines and he said let
[3:28:52.400 --> 3:28:58.880]  me tell you why he said when we have bread lines there is scarcity and scarcity is good for a system
[3:28:58.880 --> 3:29:05.120]  like ours because people have to get in line to get their food and that they're in line they don't
[3:29:05.120 --> 3:29:11.760]  have a lot of time to uh become politically active they don't have a lot of time to organize against
[3:29:11.760 --> 3:29:18.320]  the state and if the lines are very long then you have to have policemen to keep order in the lines
[3:29:18.320 --> 3:29:24.240]  and people become desperate and they become very controllable and he said with long lines and
[3:29:24.240 --> 3:29:31.920]  shortages therefore the state can determine who gets fed and who does not and so scarcity becomes
[3:29:31.920 --> 3:29:37.280]  an objective of these collectivist systems and that's why they want everyone in the world
[3:29:37.280 --> 3:29:43.200]  on a carbon credit ration card you slide and when you go pass your credits no more food
[3:29:43.200 --> 3:29:47.920]  even if you have the money to buy it that is inches away from being law in california and england
[3:29:51.280 --> 3:29:58.000]  we're on the march the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[3:29:58.000 --> 3:30:06.080]  the illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat
[3:30:06.080 --> 3:30:11.040]  will you continue to be their profit center buying their processed food that makes you sick go to the

[3:34:02.480 --> 3:34:10.000]  for a whole day on um where we're headed and what to do about it uh i urge you to come to our reality
[3:34:10.000 --> 3:34:16.080]  zone site and and check out the seminar page that's reality zone dot com you go to the landing page
[3:34:16.080 --> 3:34:21.840]  and you'll see uh my picture there and that's the uh doorway into the seminar information
[3:34:21.840 --> 3:34:27.840]  so that's taken a lot of my time alex and uh i'm happy to report that the the two seminars we've
[3:34:27.840 --> 3:34:34.000]  had so far one in los angeles and one in at atlanta last weekend were highly successful
[3:34:34.000 --> 3:34:39.680]  and uh people have told me that they had their expectations completely fulfilled which makes
[3:34:39.680 --> 3:34:44.480]  me feel good about it oh you're a very powerful lecture it's even more powerful than on the radio
[3:34:44.480 --> 3:34:48.800]  because you can really flow uh i want to go to some calls here in the last segment we have with you
[3:34:48.800 --> 3:34:57.280]  but uh to to to put a positive light on this because i truly do believe that some positive things
[3:34:57.920 --> 3:35:03.760]  are happening gebra griffin we are seeing an exponential awakening and and the globalists
[3:35:03.760 --> 3:35:08.480]  denying they were building this in the past it's really handicapping them now that they're having
[3:35:08.480 --> 3:35:15.280]  to admit it and uh i i i know they're not invincible and if people will take action at the local
[3:35:15.280 --> 3:35:20.800]  county city uh congressional level and and really get involved we can stop them and our message of
[3:35:20.800 --> 3:35:26.960]  liberty and and our message against collectivism is really spreading and the globalists in a lot
[3:35:26.960 --> 3:35:31.680]  of their own publications as i know you're aware are really starting to complain and say that uh
[3:35:32.480 --> 3:35:36.880]  we better hurry up and finish this because the opposition is really starting to mount
[3:35:36.880 --> 3:35:42.800]  yeah they're scared to death of the size of the opposition they've always known there would be a
[3:35:42.800 --> 3:35:48.960]  lot of it but i think the size of it is surprising to them and of course the internet and talk radio
[3:35:48.960 --> 3:35:53.600]  are two of the main channels by which this movement is growing and and they're really
[3:35:53.600 --> 3:35:59.280]  focusing hard on those two areas they would like to close you down and they'd like to close down
[3:35:59.280 --> 3:36:05.760]  the internet as soon as possible so our little window of opportunity is is not so big but it's
[3:36:05.760 --> 3:36:11.600]  still open and i agree with you we can still do it and but we better get busy you know that's an
[3:36:11.600 --> 3:36:16.640]  amazing admission j rockefeller in the senate committee saying we would have been better off
[3:36:16.640 --> 3:36:21.920]  without the internet uh having obama come out and say the nsa is taking over the web we may have to
[3:36:21.920 --> 3:36:28.000]  shut it off to save it during emergencies they're really setting the stage to control the internet
[3:36:28.000 --> 3:36:32.640]  and shut it down and tax it and regulate it uh things are moving very quickly and they wouldn't
[3:36:32.640 --> 3:36:38.560]  be getting ready to shut it off and and starting to broach the subject if it wasn't hurting them
[3:36:38.560 --> 3:36:43.440]  jim in illinois you're on the air with g edward griffin go ahead hey guys how's it going thanks
[3:36:43.440 --> 3:36:47.920]  for everything you do um i just had a couple comments kind of expanding on what you're talking
[3:36:47.920 --> 3:36:53.440]  about uh just more like i think there might be a couple things that could at least slow them down
[3:36:53.440 --> 3:36:58.960]  a little and uh you know if we could maybe audit the fed get that moving if we could get any kind
[3:36:58.960 --> 3:37:06.080]  of 9 11 truth going and um you know if there was any possible way to get our our uh our soldiers
[3:37:06.080 --> 3:37:11.520]  back home i think all that any one of those would slow them down big time but uh if then one other
[3:37:11.520 --> 3:37:16.160]  thing if you guys could kind of expand on you know you've been fighting the system so long
[3:37:16.720 --> 3:37:21.280]  that like uh you know the at the rate it's growing do you think by like the next generation
[3:37:21.280 --> 3:37:26.400]  we will just overwhelm them with how many people understand liberty and what really comes with that
[3:37:26.400 --> 3:37:35.360]  that i like the concept of the next generation i think that by the next generation and certainly
[3:37:35.360 --> 3:37:41.200]  the one after that uh victory will be ours but i don't think it'll be because of just
[3:37:41.200 --> 3:37:47.520]  overwhelming them with numbers i think it'll be because that out of those who do understand
[3:37:48.160 --> 3:37:55.360]  the uh the issues that a small number of those people three percent or less will move
[3:37:55.360 --> 3:38:01.520]  and take control of the system they will recapture control of the power centers of society and
[3:38:01.520 --> 3:38:05.680]  lead the rest of the people i don't think it's going to be just the sheer force of numbers
[3:38:05.680 --> 3:38:11.680]  although that is necessary in order to provide the moral support sure i mean g edward the biggest
[3:38:11.680 --> 3:38:17.600]  issue is exposure if we person by person expose the global architecture so people know what they're
[3:38:17.600 --> 3:38:23.040]  seeing understand what they're dealing with this thing will implode thank you jim ken in new york
[3:38:23.040 --> 3:38:29.360]  you're on the air but you ever griffin go ahead hey alex um i just had some questions about the hr
[3:38:30.080 --> 3:38:36.560]  127 i'm just wondering why this bill i mean has 311 cosponsors why haven't we heard about anything
[3:38:36.560 --> 3:38:40.960]  it's about in the mainstream media i mean fox is head because the mainstream media is owned by the
[3:38:40.960 --> 3:38:47.760]  same banks that don't want to be audited ron paul has over 309 sponsors the senate gutted the bill
[3:38:47.760 --> 3:38:53.520]  but we've gone from no sponsors to 300 now people are beginning to realize the real government is
[3:38:53.520 --> 3:38:58.960]  the federal reserve so the beginning of the end has begun we've we've made more strides the last
[3:38:58.960 --> 3:39:04.160]  three or four years against the private federal reserve and we made the last 50 so the worm is
[3:39:04.160 --> 3:39:09.680]  turning g edward griffin yeah i agree with that and uh however we must be realistic that a lot of
[3:39:09.680 --> 3:39:15.520]  those uh cosponsors for that bill are doing some grandstanding they know that their constituents
[3:39:15.520 --> 3:39:20.720]  want them to look good if you asked a lot of those guys would they be in favor of abolishing the fed
[3:39:20.720 --> 3:39:25.280]  they'd say hell no man i wouldn't do anything like that g edward but i want to add the caveat here
[3:39:25.280 --> 3:39:30.160]  and i understand what you're saying why audit it just abolish it ron paul's being shrewd here
[3:39:30.160 --> 3:39:36.480]  if they can audit it will so uh damage the fed and expose their activities and their insider
[3:39:36.480 --> 3:39:41.520]  manipulations that that will be the beginning of the end and so ron paul's using an incremental
[3:39:41.520 --> 3:39:48.080]  uh approach here i understand a lot of it is grandstanding uh but uh it's still overall is very
[3:39:48.080 --> 3:39:53.680]  positive to point out it's never been audited oh i agree with that and i i do uh endorse this
[3:39:53.680 --> 3:39:58.880]  movement as for that reason and also it's a means of causing people to think about the fed they
[3:39:58.880 --> 3:40:03.840]  never thought about it before exactly thinking about it but in a negative light so it's it's
[3:40:03.840 --> 3:40:10.480]  really a good move but anyway we must be realistic that a lot of the support is is not as deep as
[3:40:10.480 --> 3:40:17.280]  ron's support thank you ken jason and mass you're on the air go ahead hi mr griffin
[3:40:18.000 --> 3:40:24.400]  hello hello hello sorry you're on air oh hey uh great show alex i've been listening for about
[3:40:24.400 --> 3:40:30.960]  a year um i've been sending out hundreds of dvds i love the new movie um mr griffin your your
[3:40:30.960 --> 3:40:36.640]  books are excellent and i wanted you to know that uh you've inspired me to do a comic book about the
[3:40:36.640 --> 3:40:42.320]  fed and uh i'd love to share that with you somehow or maybe even get some feedback on it from you
[3:40:42.320 --> 3:40:49.440]  someday that'd be amazing i'd love to see a comic book on the fed i don't think it'd be funny but
[3:40:50.480 --> 3:40:55.840]  it would be probably effective i have been trying to put some humor in it actually because
[3:40:55.840 --> 3:41:06.720]  it's too dreadful um alex i just had a comment uh maybe mr griffin you can comment on this excuse
[3:41:06.720 --> 3:41:14.000]  me um i get angry when i when i hear all these dirt talkers on uh bothering you and getting you
[3:41:14.000 --> 3:41:20.240]  upset and i've been wondering for a long time why you even acknowledged some of them uh when as you
[3:41:20.240 --> 3:41:28.480]  say your fruits speak for you and being a as a gentleman you know why uh why you need to respond
[3:41:28.480 --> 3:41:33.840]  to some of them when i you know i don't think a gentleman really needs to uh well i mean we're
[3:41:33.840 --> 3:41:38.960]  talking about this right now i i appreciate your call look look there's gonna be co-intel pro that's
[3:41:38.960 --> 3:41:44.640]  gonna attack jeb rd griffin myself everybody else it doesn't matter the world government's here
[3:41:44.640 --> 3:41:49.120]  there's no more denial what are we going to do about it do you have any comments on this jeb word
[3:41:49.120 --> 3:41:54.160]  well yeah i think his issue was why do i waste time i presume he's talking about our newsletter
[3:41:54.160 --> 3:41:59.520]  unfiltered news i get some people that come in and they want to tear my arguments apart and
[3:41:59.520 --> 3:42:06.080]  and i often do respond and the reason i do that is uh not because i expect to convince these people
[3:42:06.080 --> 3:42:12.960]  but you know uh they do raise issues that i think are in the minds of others that i feel that if i
[3:42:12.960 --> 3:42:19.520]  don't answer them uh i'm not doing my job and i'm really i try to answer them as best i can
[3:42:19.520 --> 3:42:26.400]  without egg without becoming antagonistic or angry because i'm really writing for other people to
[3:42:26.400 --> 3:42:32.160]  read and not the person who's written in that dirt talk as he calls it because we know that they
[3:42:32.160 --> 3:42:37.600]  just throw out those lies hoping ignorant people didn't think we're lying i mean here's an example
[3:42:37.600 --> 3:42:42.320]  i noticed a campaign on the web in the last two weeks when i made a big deal out of band
[3:42:42.320 --> 3:42:49.680]  kai moon he is the secretary general of the un the un is real he the new york times is real
[3:42:49.680 --> 3:42:55.760]  the title was we can do it and i noticed a dis info campaign on my comment pages and on youtube
[3:42:55.760 --> 3:43:00.960]  but i wasn't even looking for this under different names with the same cut and paste saying i went
[3:43:00.960 --> 3:43:06.800]  and looked at that band kai moon didn't write that it's a lie he never said global government
[3:43:06.800 --> 3:43:12.880]  and they're not targeting thinkers or they're not targeting people uh that already know the truth
[3:43:12.880 --> 3:43:17.760]  they just want the average person to read that and think i'm lying because that's what a lot
[3:43:17.760 --> 3:43:23.840]  of propaganda is just down and dirty meant to get people off track yeah sound bites they love sound
[3:43:23.840 --> 3:43:30.240]  bites i i got a real hard look at that the other day when i saw a panel on the uh cfr they were in
[3:43:30.240 --> 3:43:35.520]  the cfr building talking about how to convince people to go get those flu shots and they said well
[3:43:35.520 --> 3:43:40.640]  we should have sound bites like for example and then they said tell the people that there's more
[3:43:40.640 --> 3:43:48.080]  mercury in a tuna sandwich than in a flu shot sound bite bingo and to show that the cfr is really
[3:43:48.880 --> 3:43:54.480]  calling a lot of the shots or setting up the uh implementing the policy that was a month ago
[3:43:54.480 --> 3:43:58.880]  now suddenly we see the tuna fish sandwich line everywhere and they also laugh and say
[3:43:58.880 --> 3:44:03.840]  we'll say there's not enough vaccine only have it at certain spots to create a panic
[3:44:03.840 --> 3:44:09.360]  to put that on the news and then they all laugh see it's it's so fun to criminally manipulate
[3:44:09.360 --> 3:44:14.000]  yeah so there there it is and that's why they love sound bites because as you said that the
[3:44:14.000 --> 3:44:18.480]  unthinking people will will accept that as substance all right we're gonna let you go in
[3:44:18.480 --> 3:44:22.800]  just a moment i know you're a busy man we're gonna take two quick final calls kevin in wisconsin
[3:44:22.800 --> 3:44:29.920]  you're on the air go ahead thanks for having me um i just had a question and a comment um my comment
[3:44:29.920 --> 3:44:37.280]  is through their systems of uh roundtable groups and their power structure they're squeezing us
[3:44:37.280 --> 3:44:43.600]  like a cancer from the inside why don't we just start as a people informing their power structure
[3:44:43.600 --> 3:44:47.840]  and their groups to what's going on by handing out your documentaries and letting them know
[3:44:47.840 --> 3:44:52.560]  what's going wrong and that's true there are a lot of people compartmentalized at higher levels
[3:44:52.560 --> 3:44:56.880]  who really don't see the big picture and that's a lot of the whistleblowers we have the media
[3:44:56.880 --> 3:45:02.880]  just ignores them we the alternative media have to magnify that uh but uh g edward comments on that
[3:45:03.440 --> 3:45:08.480]  well i think your caller has the solution that we just have to use the handout power
[3:45:08.480 --> 3:45:12.240]  and boy we got a lot of people out there if they're just willing to hand out
[3:45:12.240 --> 3:45:20.560]  10 or 20 dvds or cds uh we'll reach the world that way and that's why they're so scared and
[3:45:20.560 --> 3:45:26.640]  so i i'm what i'm saying is i agree let's get let's get on with it let's do it okay let's talk to uh
[3:45:26.640 --> 3:45:34.640]  shanky in georgia or shanky go ahead you're on the air shanky uh alex jedward thanks for having
[3:45:34.640 --> 3:45:39.920]  me uh alex want to thank you and jenesis and and your old team everything for what y'all do um
[3:45:39.920 --> 3:45:47.440]  jedward your books and work is magnificent uh just um really you're right i used to be a
[3:45:47.440 --> 3:45:52.160]  want to call up and disagree with you and get to the front of the line alex i'm quite a conservative
[3:45:52.720 --> 3:45:56.800]  but i've changed quite a bit and uh come to see the lights so to speak
[3:45:56.800 --> 3:46:02.080]  follow the public and uh all your movies are just fantastic i really enjoy them uh as a matter of
[3:46:02.080 --> 3:46:07.360]  fact i've got them at the top of my blog for everybody to see jedward i got a quick question
[3:46:07.360 --> 3:46:14.880]  and is on the stock market and the monetization and the open market operations and and and
[3:46:14.880 --> 3:46:21.840]  does it effects their effects on on the the dollar the trader is what and the actual manipulation
[3:46:21.840 --> 3:46:28.480]  of the market uh to these new highs can you comment on that please well there's no question that the
[3:46:28.480 --> 3:46:34.480]  fed has total control over manipulation and ability to manipulate the uh the market by
[3:46:34.480 --> 3:46:41.360]  manipulating credit and therefore the amount of uh money that's in circulation and what we see now
[3:46:41.360 --> 3:46:47.280]  is that there's a lot of money going out of existence because of uh of bad debts being
[3:46:47.280 --> 3:46:53.600]  written off and lowering and and home values and mortgages collapsing and all that sort of thing
[3:46:53.600 --> 3:47:00.160]  but at the same time uh the fed with full cooperation of the congress is creating trillions
[3:47:00.160 --> 3:47:07.760]  of new money coming in to replace that old money that's going out and so we see right now um it's
[3:47:07.760 --> 3:47:13.440]  kind of a maintenance of the money supply it's not growing nearly as fast as we might expect
[3:47:13.440 --> 3:47:18.880]  because there's money going out of existence at the same time but what people are missing is the
[3:47:18.880 --> 3:47:24.400]  fact that the old money going out of existence is coming from the middle class those are the people
[3:47:24.400 --> 3:47:30.240]  losing value in their savings and on their assets yes it's a vertical integration a transference of
[3:47:30.240 --> 3:47:34.800]  wealth because they want control but let me ask you this quick quickly uh the caller from georgia
[3:47:34.800 --> 3:47:41.040]  uh shanky what made you finally wake up what the admissions of world government in the news

[3:48:05.200 --> 3:48:10.240]  better than this but now i'm starting to see it and now the more i look into the the the
[3:48:10.240 --> 3:48:17.600]  vaccine vaccine issues and and the really totally fascist state that we're becoming we we've skipped
[3:48:17.600 --> 3:48:25.360]  socialism and in one broad step um and and and that realization and and i i write a blog and i

[3:56:04.160 --> 3:56:09.920]  this is um this is the net the last nail on the coffin for the united states um this health care
[3:56:09.920 --> 3:56:15.520]  bill is just a framework to plug in the massive eugenics policy against us and we you know we
[3:56:15.520 --> 3:56:22.000]  have to try we have to fight i i want people i mean i'm asking people to go to their um state
[3:56:22.000 --> 3:56:26.720]  capitals and protest at their senator's office because it's in the senate now they're saying
[3:56:26.720 --> 3:56:32.240]  that it's not going to go through but they have the votes to let it go through so you know i just
[3:56:32.240 --> 3:56:38.160]  say we have to give one big last push against us because it's so incredibly evil well the health
[3:56:38.160 --> 3:56:45.760]  care bills going up for a vote uh on november 17th that's only five days away that's next uh
[3:56:45.760 --> 3:56:50.960]  what's what's the 17th is that next wednesday or thursday i think it's wednesday i think yeah so
[3:56:50.960 --> 3:56:55.040]  and and no one then they could launch it tomorrow they're so deceptive and sneaky

[3:57:02.480 --> 3:57:07.920]  hey buddy hey i've got a visual aid for everyone they probably have one already
[3:57:08.720 --> 3:57:13.680]  what if all the the truthers the burners everyone that listens to your show
[3:57:14.720 --> 3:57:20.800]  all the 912ers what if we all flipped our flag for freedom would that wake a lot of people up
[3:57:20.800 --> 3:57:27.440]  you're talking about flying the flag upside down yes sir we're nation under distress well a lot of
[3:57:27.440 --> 3:57:31.760]  people do that the cops come arrest them even though it's not illegal and it does get national
[3:57:31.760 --> 3:57:36.160]  attention and then you can explain why you did it because america's in a crisis and i think it
[3:57:36.160 --> 3:57:41.600]  certainly works but they come and find you fee you arrest you take it down people get physically
[3:57:41.600 --> 3:57:47.840]  attacked because people don't know what flying the flag upside down means and they don't care
[3:57:47.840 --> 3:57:53.120]  a foreign banker bankers rape america all they care or or the dollars plunging and their life's
[3:57:53.120 --> 3:57:58.880]  going to be destroyed financially they care about kind of petty transitory things but yeah i mean
[3:57:58.880 --> 3:58:03.920]  i think it's a good idea to fly your flag upside down we got a t-shirt uh it's got the flag upside
[3:58:03.920 --> 3:58:10.240]  down on it it explains why my message to everyone out there listening flip your flag for freedom
