[00:00:09.608 --> 00:00:13.493]  He's pounding down, loaded up and trucking.
[00:00:13.493 --> 00:00:16.798]  Are we gonna do what they say can't be done?
[00:00:16.798 --> 00:00:18.440]  We've got a long way to go.
[00:00:25.478 --> 00:00:29.901]  Massive anti-government protests are taking place all across Iran.
[00:00:29.901 --> 00:00:34.245]  And these protests were sparked Thursday and they've only continued to grow in size.
[00:00:34.245 --> 00:00:37.807]  Massive demonstrations against the Islamist regime as a whole.
[00:00:37.807 --> 00:00:40.309]  They're chanting, we do not want an Islamic Republic.
[00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.431]  We do not want an oppressive regime.
[00:00:43.431 --> 00:00:45.873]  We do not want mercenary police.
[00:00:45.873 --> 00:00:50.457]  There have been reports that protesters have been shot at, several of them killed.
[00:00:50.457 --> 00:00:52.178]  But they want the Ayatollah out.
[00:00:52.598 --> 00:01:00.383]  But to hear the mainstream media talk about these Iranian protests, you would think that it's just over economic unrest.
[00:01:00.383 --> 00:01:02.244]  Just your typical labor protest.
[00:01:02.244 --> 00:01:03.325]  Something we see in Iran.
[00:01:03.325 --> 00:01:05.146]  But these are massive demonstrations.
[00:01:05.146 --> 00:01:07.208]  They haven't had this many people taken to the streets.
[00:01:07.948 --> 00:01:13.209]  Since 2009, when the people were protesting what they thought was a rigged election.
[00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:22.731]  So, what we're seeing is CNN's headline, Iranians hold pro-government rallies after two days of rare anti-government protests.
[00:01:22.731 --> 00:01:26.291]  A witness said government supporters rallied in Tehran.
[00:01:26.291 --> 00:01:35.813]  So, they're not talking to you about the massive numbers of people who are protesting against the government, but they'll tell you about this one little group that a witness said took
[00:01:35.973 --> 00:01:41.135]  ...place where they were pro their oppressive Iranian regime.
[00:01:41.135 --> 00:01:41.895]  Why?
[00:01:41.895 --> 00:01:45.097]  What in the world is this reporting style?
[00:01:45.097 --> 00:01:50.719]  The Washington Post, there was absolutely nothing about the Iranian protests on their front page.
[00:01:50.719 --> 00:02:00.303]  CNN was actually called out by Ted Cruz, who said, look, when you guys are being accused of being fake news propaganda, maybe try not to write stories that read like Iranian Pravda.
[00:02:00.663 --> 00:02:09.787]  Now, of course, we've got an opinion article up by Stephen L. Miller over at Fox News who's saying, why are the mainstream media outlets so hesitant to report on Iran's protests?
[00:02:09.787 --> 00:02:25.754]  And he points out how the New York Times and others, the Washington Post, they talked about these protests and described them simply as economic grievances, which is the same way Iranian state-run television described them as well.
[00:02:25.754 --> 00:02:26.995]  So a lot of people are wondering,
[00:02:27.515 --> 00:02:31.220]  What's up with the mainstream media coverage of these protests?
[00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:44.237]  Are they for an authoritarian police state, Islamofascist dictatorship that subjugates women and tortures and kills its dissidents and issues the death penalty for crimes like homosexuality?
[00:02:45.177 --> 00:02:50.258]  You know, it seems like this is something they could get behind, but for whatever reason they are not.
[00:02:50.258 --> 00:03:00.920]  Is it because women in Iran are defying the Islamic religious dress code that was implemented in 1979 that said women had to wear their hijab or they would face arrest?
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:09.302]  Here we have one woman standing up defying that law, that dress code, and she doesn't have her head covering, she doesn't have her male handler out there with her.
[00:03:09.782 --> 00:03:12.804]  She's standing up alone quickly becoming an icon of that protest.
[00:03:12.804 --> 00:03:28.935]  You can compare her to the original women's marchers in Iran in 1979 who came out to show that they were also against this Islamic dress code as well when it was originally imposed after the Iranian revolution in 1979.
[00:03:28.935 --> 00:03:32.277]  Are these Western media outlets silent because they
[00:03:32.817 --> 00:03:40.700]  Promoted the women's marks and the hijab as a symbol of empowerment like they're just it's so empowering Remember people were crying.
[00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.081]  We even have a man wearing a hijab.
[00:03:43.081 --> 00:03:43.682]  Oh my god.
[00:03:43.682 --> 00:03:55.527]  He's so empowered People were really upset about this They said you know what women in oppressive countries don't have a choice when it comes to wearing the hijab So it's kind of a ridiculous that you would use this as a symbol of female empowerment
[00:03:56.407 --> 00:04:00.749]  Is that why the media isn't really covering that angle of the protests?
[00:04:00.749 --> 00:04:07.452]  Or is the media failing to cover these Iranian protests in order to protect the legacy of the Obama-Iran nuclear deal?
[00:04:07.452 --> 00:04:13.675]  Let's not forget the establishment media were the main cheerleaders pumping out propaganda about this deal.
[00:04:13.675 --> 00:04:18.978]  Anyone who even asked questions about it or criticized it at all was immediately attacked.
[00:04:19.238 --> 00:04:21.220]  Let's not forget this deal that was so good.
[00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:28.808]  Obama had to send a plane with $400 million in cash to Iran the day that they made this deal official.
[00:04:28.808 --> 00:04:33.272]  And it was also a ransom payment that Iran agreed to release some of our prisoners.
[00:04:33.272 --> 00:04:35.955]  Okay, that's a report from Leanne McAdoo.
[00:04:35.955 --> 00:04:40.200]  You can find the full report on the Alex Jones YouTube channel.
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.920]  Right there it is.
[00:04:42.321 --> 00:04:52.853]  The silence from the liberal media on the Iranian protest, the silence from Linda Sarsour, the silence from the Women's March on the Iranian protest is deafening.
[00:04:52.853 --> 00:04:55.016]  We've got stacks and stacks of news on the other side.
[00:04:55.016 --> 00:04:55.937]  Roger Stone joins us.
[00:04:55.937 --> 00:04:56.578]  Don't go anywhere.
[00:04:56.578 --> 00:04:57.439]  This is The War Room.
[00:05:00.942 --> 00:05:01.723]  I'm so excited.
[00:05:01.723 --> 00:05:11.869]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[00:05:11.869 --> 00:05:20.395]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[00:05:20.395 --> 00:05:29.181]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:36.562]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers.
[00:05:36.562 --> 00:05:41.523]  Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[00:05:41.523 --> 00:05:50.846]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[00:05:50.846 --> 00:05:53.527]  It is amazing!
[00:05:53.527 --> 00:05:58.489]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase funds the operation.
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:15.966]  Let's make talk radio great again!
[00:06:15.966 --> 00:06:17.828]  This is the War Room!
[00:06:41.457 --> 00:06:42.978]  Welcome back.
[00:06:42.978 --> 00:06:47.842]  I'm Roger Stone, and you're in the War Room.
[00:06:47.842 --> 00:06:58.170]  This is part of the expanded coverage that Alex Jones has mapped out for the burgeoning InfoWars Information Command Center.
[00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:23.444]  We have now opened our bureau in Miami, we've opened our bureau in New York, we've opened our bureau in DC, and we are bringing you more of the incisive investigative journalism exposing the excesses and crimes of the globalist left and those who would betray the American dream.
[00:07:23.444 --> 00:07:28.187]  They had the presidential election of 2016 completely wired, you see.
[00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:38.514]  Hillary Clinton was going to be president and Jeb Bush's job for his cut was to be a graceful loser.
[00:07:38.514 --> 00:07:57.221]  And if Hillary was so inept that Jeb managed to win, it didn't really matter because all the same people would have jobs and the Bushes will merely cut the Clintons in the way the Clintons have always cut the Bushes in for a piece of their massive theft.
[00:07:58.374 --> 00:08:01.576]  They are both crony capitalists.
[00:08:01.576 --> 00:08:02.917]  Don't kid yourself.
[00:08:02.917 --> 00:08:06.539]  The Clintons are not liberals or progressives.
[00:08:06.539 --> 00:08:10.921]  They believe in nothing but the money.
[00:08:10.921 --> 00:08:16.824]  The Bushes are not conservatives or libertarians or liberty oriented.
[00:08:16.824 --> 00:08:20.166]  They believe in anything they need to.
[00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:21.287]  George H.W.
[00:08:21.287 --> 00:08:26.950]  Bush can run as an abortion proponent and then later say he was always pro-life.
[00:08:28.011 --> 00:08:41.954]  He can support the entire agenda of the John Birch Society while running for the Senate in 1964, and he can disavow every piece of it running for Congress in 1966.
[00:08:41.954 --> 00:08:45.695]  So we have, I think, now turned the corner.
[00:08:49.336 --> 00:08:49.716]  We're good.
[00:09:07.868 --> 00:09:21.695]  Advisors to Barack Obama have been criticizing Donald Trump for supporting the uprising by women across the Middle East and in Iran.
[00:09:21.695 --> 00:09:36.182]  See, those days are over when you look the other way at the excesses of this crazy ideology that crushes women and gays and Christians or anyone who refuses to see things the way they see them.
[00:09:37.398 --> 00:09:51.374]  Donald Trump's posting of a link that showed ISIS slaughtering a handicapped Dutch man is now the formal policy of the United States.
[00:09:51.374 --> 00:09:55.980]  We call Islamic terrorism what it is.
[00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:57.081]  Let's be clear.
[00:09:57.961 --> 00:10:04.124]  None of us here at Infowars are for excessive foreign expansionism.
[00:10:04.124 --> 00:10:16.330]  We don't want more foreign wars that cost billions, in which the elites profiteer, but our inherent national interest is just nowhere to be found.
[00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:40.463]  We, at the same time, recognize that because of the conduct of foreign policy by the Bushes and the Clintons, in which they change sides so frequently and armed both our friends and our foes, leaves Donald Trump with ISIS, a loose end that unfortunately he has no choice as a realist, but to clean up.
[00:10:40.463 --> 00:10:46.626]  My fear, as I expressed yesterday on the War Room, is that the generals around him,
[00:10:47.613 --> 00:10:51.275]  Kelly, whose own politics are progressive left.
[00:10:51.275 --> 00:10:59.638]  Mattis, who admitted before the election that he voted for Hillary and specifically denounced Trump.
[00:10:59.638 --> 00:11:03.220]  And of course, H.R.
[00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:16.826]  McMaster, who has proved his disloyalty, pardon me, in the incident with Sophia Katz, the CEO of Oracle.
[00:11:17.415 --> 00:11:37.009]  It was InfoWars that first reported that the National Security Advisor to the President sat in a dinner with this eminent businesswoman who is widely respected, and after too many belts, was bad-mouthing the President of the United States.
[00:11:38.266 --> 00:11:51.909]  We reported specifically that McMaster took a cell phone call from the President, stepped away from the table, as would be appropriate, and came back to the table to comment that the President was an idiot.
[00:11:51.909 --> 00:11:54.529]  He later called him a moron.
[00:11:54.529 --> 00:12:01.991]  He said his ability to understand anything beyond 140 characters is non-existent.
[00:12:01.991 --> 00:12:02.891]  He's a child.
[00:12:03.989 --> 00:12:05.310]  I, H.R.
[00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:10.473]  McMaster, must save the world from nuclear destruction.
[00:12:10.473 --> 00:12:25.662]  Katz was so appalled by this boast and this treachery that she informed her close friend Sheldon Adelson, the philanthropist and gaming magnate from Nevada.
[00:12:25.662 --> 00:12:32.186]  And only months later, the mainstream media confirmed the existence
[00:12:33.494 --> 00:12:43.496]  of this dinner and the precise conversation that we hear at InfoWars Predictive.
[00:12:43.496 --> 00:12:51.617]  I have been extraordinarily impressed looking at the new front line of products that have come up at the InfoWars store.
[00:12:51.617 --> 00:13:01.899]  You know, I have myself long been an aficionado of both Eastern medicine, herbology,
[00:13:02.742 --> 00:13:12.890]  Acupuncture, Tai Chi, Qigong, a little more exotic form of martial arts.
[00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:31.384]  And I recognize that Chinese medicine, Eastern medicine, has only existed for several centuries longer than the take a pill mentality of big pharma and many, not all, but many AMA trained doctors today.
[00:13:33.425 --> 00:13:51.692]  Sadly, there are still millions in the medical establishment who skew what is very clearly therapy and benefits from natural herbs and natural supplements, all of which of course are legal.
[00:13:51.692 --> 00:14:02.456]  There are benefits in acupuncture, there are benefits in nutritional products, particularly if one is trying to gain weight and is training hard.
[00:14:03.237 --> 00:14:13.032]  And Alex Jones really does an amazing job of fusing the best with some of the oldest and ancient but effective blends.
[00:14:13.032 --> 00:14:14.975]  The new Alpha Power Blend.
[00:14:16.189 --> 00:14:18.390]  Look, I've taken a lot of energy tonics.
[00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:21.730]  That's what this is called in Chinese medicine.
[00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:23.530]  It's heat-based, as they say.
[00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:28.831]  This just blows me away in terms of my energy level.
[00:14:28.831 --> 00:14:30.352]  I get a better run in the morning.
[00:14:30.352 --> 00:14:34.252]  I can work later at night.
[00:14:34.252 --> 00:14:37.693]  It has really changed my work habits.
[00:14:37.693 --> 00:14:39.193]  And right now, you can get it at $34.95, which is 50%
[00:14:43.714 --> 00:14:44.735]  Cut.
[00:14:44.735 --> 00:14:54.339]  You know, I am now going to look at Carnivore, which is a digestive enzyme formula.
[00:14:54.339 --> 00:14:56.600]  It's now 33% off.
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:06.245]  This one is important because I, while I respect those who eschew red meat and who prefer to take their
[00:15:06.761 --> 00:15:10.683]  Protein as chicken or fish or turkey.
[00:15:10.683 --> 00:15:19.247]  And I really cannot get down with the vegans and the vegetarians out there because I think it takes protein to build muscle.
[00:15:19.247 --> 00:15:30.113]  At the same time, some red meat in your diet, some, particularly if you're trying to stay in shape and you're exercising regularly, I think is required.
[00:15:30.882 --> 00:15:39.427]  Carnivore is similar to a product that I've taken before, although my son has taken it and he says it's much better.
[00:15:39.427 --> 00:15:40.608]  I've just ordered it.
[00:15:40.608 --> 00:15:48.112]  It helps you digest in your gut and break down the enzymes commonly found in red meat.
[00:15:48.112 --> 00:15:52.215]  And it really is enticing.
[00:15:52.215 --> 00:15:52.895]  I've got it.
[00:15:52.895 --> 00:15:54.336]  I'm going to try it.
[00:15:54.336 --> 00:15:57.658]  My son is yet another satisfied customer.
[00:15:59.375 --> 00:16:07.619]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the info war.
[00:16:07.619 --> 00:16:08.859]  A 360 win.
[00:16:08.859 --> 00:16:15.402]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at infowarshore.com.
[00:16:15.402 --> 00:16:22.926]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[00:16:23.326 --> 00:16:28.010]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:34.516]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[00:16:34.516 --> 00:16:42.322]  Just go to InfoWarsStore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on AutoShip, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[00:16:42.322 --> 00:16:48.808]  As you know, I coined the term 360Win, and with the new AutoShip feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[00:16:48.808 --> 00:16:50.329]  10% off on AutoShip.
[00:16:50.489 --> 00:16:52.909]  Win-win-win at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:16:52.909 --> 00:16:54.890]  Free shipping on orders above 50 bucks.
[00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:58.991]  And all out of stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto ship.
[00:16:58.991 --> 00:17:04.972]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by InfoWars Life.
[00:17:04.972 --> 00:17:09.133]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[00:17:09.133 --> 00:17:16.414]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1 to 2 percent per year.
[00:17:17.174 --> 00:17:24.318]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.
[00:17:24.318 --> 00:17:30.181]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.
[00:17:30.181 --> 00:17:42.308]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms, including uricoma longifolia, originally from Malaysia.
[00:17:42.988 --> 00:17:49.294]  Macaroo from Peru, Horny Goatweed from China and Tribulus from India.
[00:17:49.294 --> 00:17:53.238]  Reach your alpha male potential with Alpha Power.
[00:17:53.238 --> 00:17:58.443]  Get Alpha Power now at 50% off and secure your bottle today.
[00:17:59.887 --> 00:18:04.288]  Fuel your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[00:18:04.288 --> 00:18:12.370]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestive process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:17.651]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[00:18:17.651 --> 00:18:20.191]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[00:18:20.191 --> 00:18:24.412]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.

[00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:07.255]  Proper B vitamin intake is essential to keep the body functioning at optimum levels.
[00:19:10.202 --> 00:19:15.268]  With our modern diets, it can be hard to get the recommended amount of B vitamins we need every day.
[00:19:15.268 --> 00:19:17.170]  O-O-O-O-Optimum levels.
[00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:18.952]  B vitamins we need every day.

[00:19:34.024 --> 00:19:35.185]  Optimal absorption.
[00:19:35.185 --> 00:19:40.328]  B vitamins help the body convert food into energy by supporting your intercellular processes.
[00:19:40.328 --> 00:19:45.491]  B vitamins are also essential for the optimal functioning of the brain and nervous system.

[00:20:04.904 --> 00:20:06.045]  The War Room.
[00:20:06.045 --> 00:20:08.666]  InfoWars.com forward slash.
[00:20:08.666 --> 00:20:10.448]  1, 2, 3.
[00:20:10.448 --> 00:20:10.488]  1, 2, 3.
[00:20:37.664 --> 00:20:39.545]  Welcome back.
[00:20:39.545 --> 00:21:01.330]  I'm Roger Stone, and you're in the War Room with your host, Roger Stone, broadcasting now from an undisclosed location in sunny South Florida, and my colleague, Owen Schroyer, in our state-of-the-art and ever-expanding InfoWars studio in Austin.
[00:21:02.397 --> 00:21:26.493]  When you visit Austin, I must tell you, it is, it's exhilarating because there's a great spirit on the InfoWars staff, not only the on-air talent, but all of the great writers and technicians and IT people, and there's always kind of a small coterie of activists hanging around, and the energy is really significant.
[00:21:26.493 --> 00:21:26.793]  It is a
[00:21:29.343 --> 00:21:30.284]  We're good to go.
[00:21:51.461 --> 00:21:55.064]  This is why Google seeks to snuff us.
[00:21:55.064 --> 00:21:59.447]  This is why Twitter seeks to silence us.
[00:21:59.447 --> 00:22:04.231]  This is why they want to put the toothpaste back in the tube.
[00:22:04.231 --> 00:22:16.260]  This is why they're using the laws set by the Congress to guarantee no pornography and decency on the needy are being used to suppress political speech.
[00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:40.759]  This is why it's important, as I say, that you hit the Infowars store because we are the spirit of the revolution and Trump can only be protected and the revolution continued if we are out there to defend him and expose the hypocrisy of the jackals, the hyenas who are nipping at the heels of a giant.
[00:22:41.645 --> 00:22:52.595]  I do want to say that I saw over the holiday break an extraordinary new book by the reporter, Edward Klein, entitled,
[00:22:56.443 --> 00:22:57.624]  We're good to go.
[00:23:23.583 --> 00:23:42.322]  He worked with Distinguished Service as a managing editor for Newsweek, also joined the New York Times, editor-in-chief of the New York Times Magazine, then led this flagship publication for a number of years, then at Time Magazine, winning a Pulitzer Prize.
[00:23:43.163 --> 00:24:02.961]  Ed Klein has written for Vanity Fair and so on, an extraordinary author, but his books specifically on the Obamas, on the Clintons, is some of the very best, completely unbiased investigative journalism out there today.
[00:24:02.961 --> 00:24:07.485]  And his new book, All Out War, is about the attempt to take Donald Trump down.
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:36.503]  And leafing through this terrific book, which I commend to you, I found this passage, which confirms, based on Ed Klein's research, that the Justice Department, under Barack Obama, went into the FISA court, were extraordinarily confident that they could trick a judge into allowing them to spy on four individuals.
[00:24:38.027 --> 00:24:48.950]  Those being General Flynn, Paul Manafort, the harmless, but I think decent Carter Page, and myself.
[00:24:48.950 --> 00:25:01.773]  And they were stunned when the FISA court judge declined their authority to push such a surveillance.
[00:25:01.773 --> 00:25:07.215]  Later in Klein's incredible book, he tells about how they take the exact same request
[00:25:07.927 --> 00:25:15.074]  Including yours truly, and they resubmit it to a judge and trick that judge into approval.
[00:25:15.074 --> 00:25:22.100]  Thus begins the surveillance of the Trump campaign by the deep state.
[00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:27.505]  This information is of course then used in the unmaskings.
[00:25:27.505 --> 00:25:32.610]  In some ways, I must say, I feel like the Forrest Gump of American politics.
[00:25:33.305 --> 00:25:58.711]  Whether it was the Bush-Gore recount, or whether it was the Trump campaign, or even as a wrongly accused witness in the farce that is the Russian collusion delusion, I have enjoyed a role in every major presidential campaign, albeit one.
[00:25:59.874 --> 00:26:04.559]  I was not involved in George Bush's reelection campaign.
[00:26:04.559 --> 00:26:15.910]  And I specifically told Lee Atwater, a colleague of some time, about the folly of the Willie Horton ad.
[00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:18.213]  I was a critic of that ad.
[00:26:19.183 --> 00:26:21.545]  It wasn't that I thought it might not work.
[00:26:21.545 --> 00:26:27.788]  I knew it probably would, but it would be a stain that the bushes would wear forever.
[00:26:27.788 --> 00:26:32.471]  And so, sadly, did my friend Lee Atwater.
[00:26:32.471 --> 00:26:37.714]  I have memorialized this in several articles in my books.
[00:26:37.714 --> 00:26:42.156]  I had no role in the campaign of 1992.
[00:26:43.783 --> 00:26:53.931]  So, in this particular case, I have found a few reporters who have the sources of an Ed Klein.
[00:26:53.931 --> 00:27:06.461]  I really strongly recommend Klein's book to you if you want to see the precursor to what I believe is the A, B, and C plan.
[00:27:08.445 --> 00:27:28.791]  As I reported yesterday on the War Room, the fact that Rex Tillerson is now staying after a private lunch with the President, including General McMaster, General Mattis, and General Kelly, that is because, in my opinion, they need Tillerson's vote for the coming
[00:27:29.544 --> 00:27:34.808]  11th Amendment takedown, 25th Amendment takedown, pardon me.
[00:27:34.808 --> 00:27:37.571]  We will talk about this on the other side.
[00:27:37.571 --> 00:27:45.197]  You're on The War Room with Roger Stone, and we're going to bring back my colleague Owen Schroer and kick it around.
[00:27:45.197 --> 00:27:52.142]  We'll be right back.
[00:27:52.142 --> 00:27:52.743]  And there it is.
[00:27:54.670 --> 00:28:03.035]  Alright, well actually we've got about 60 seconds left in this segment here, Roger, so I know that we're going to get into the Tillerson updates and everything else.
[00:28:03.035 --> 00:28:07.297]  I apologize, I lost my clock there for a second.
[00:28:07.297 --> 00:28:14.441]  It's interesting though, because yesterday, and I'm sure we'll talk about this too sometime before we get off here, yesterday President Trump
[00:28:15.589 --> 00:28:23.900]  Tweets out top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin guilty of X and X. The same man that was found guilty of that wound up in jail.
[00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:25.522]  Doesn't she belong in jail?
[00:28:25.522 --> 00:28:31.990]  And then here we are 24 hours later and there is a fire at Bill and Hillary Clinton's house.
[00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:33.291]  I mean it's not like Hillary Clinton
[00:28:33.852 --> 00:28:41.156]  Has a history of deleting emails or, you know, the Democrats smashing servers or not turning over servers.
[00:28:41.156 --> 00:28:44.058]  So, I'm sure there's nothing to this story.
[00:28:44.058 --> 00:28:47.319]  You know, Hillary and Bill Clinton have never done anything they want to try to hide.
[00:28:47.319 --> 00:28:49.701]  So, I'm sure that there's just nothing to this.
[00:28:49.701 --> 00:28:55.384]  It was just a house fire at Bill and Hillary's house and they're not trying to hide any evidence of any wrongdoing that they've ever done.
[00:28:55.384 --> 00:28:55.664]  No way.
[00:28:59.649 --> 00:29:04.795]  Introducing Floralife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by InfoWars Life.
[00:29:04.795 --> 00:29:09.560]  After years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same.
[00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:18.249]  Floralife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[00:29:18.249 --> 00:29:21.613]  This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics and
[00:29:21.733 --> 00:29:26.976]  So if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
[00:29:26.976 --> 00:29:34.299]  Floralife supports your body's core, where you need it most, including digestion, regularity, immunity, the gut lining, and metabolism.
[00:29:34.299 --> 00:29:38.201]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[00:29:38.201 --> 00:29:42.923]  That's why increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[00:29:42.923 --> 00:29:46.505]  Floralife is sold as a 15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care.
[00:29:47.165 --> 00:29:51.014]  Get 50 billion probiotic for a 30-day advanced gut restoration program.

[00:32:29.281 --> 00:32:29.501]  Woo!
[00:32:29.501 --> 00:32:30.541]  That's what I'm talking about.
[00:32:30.541 --> 00:32:39.283]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[00:32:39.283 --> 00:32:48.884]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[00:32:48.884 --> 00:32:52.325]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[00:32:52.325 --> 00:32:56.426]  Harvest Right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[00:32:56.426 --> 00:32:57.266]  So what are you waiting for?

[00:33:22.199 --> 00:33:29.923]  This is the return of the Republic, and this is The War Room with Roger Stone.
[00:33:29.923 --> 00:33:35.665]  Watch the live stream right now at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:33:54.622 --> 00:34:07.089]  All right, you're back in the war room with your correspondents, Roger Stone and in the Austin Power Center, Owen Schroyer.
[00:34:07.089 --> 00:34:12.452]  I'm glad you raised the issue of Huma Abedin and her emails.
[00:34:12.452 --> 00:34:16.694]  Let me try to break down for our audience what has really transpired here.
[00:34:17.632 --> 00:34:45.730]  The emails that were released by the State Department, which were emails that Huma Abedin forwarded to a server that was under the control of both she and her husband, the currently incarcerated Congressman Anthony Weiner, were but a small portion of the entire trove of emails.
[00:34:46.670 --> 00:35:00.702]  Interestingly enough, what the State Department released was evidence that Huma regularly forwarded classified documents illegally to a server she shared with her husband.
[00:35:01.357 --> 00:35:19.784]  In other words, this data dump was tailored as the evidence for the conviction of a crime, a specific crime, the misuse of classified documents, what Hillary should be charged with.
[00:35:19.784 --> 00:35:22.405]  Now, why would the State Department do this?
[00:35:23.585 --> 00:35:48.049]  To be seen in the larger light of the executive order put out last week giving the president broad powers to go after those who've been involved in public corruption or pedophilia or corporate theft or any other crime against the country, this is a chilling indictment that the perp walk is coming for Huma.
[00:35:48.049 --> 00:35:51.390]  Now, how do I know that this is just a portion
[00:35:52.111 --> 00:36:18.738]  We reported here at InfoWars during the final days of the election that the trove of emails in question was discovered not by the FBI but by the New York Police Department and that the police department had forwarded these emails discovered in their conduct of a
[00:36:20.474 --> 00:36:40.750]  Underage texting scandal involving Weiner, who would ultimately, of course, be charged, convicted, and sent to prison, and that the documents were supplied by NYPD to the FBI.
[00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:45.013]  My sources tell me that there's far, far more here than the
[00:36:48.565 --> 00:37:05.518]  Classified State Department documents, there's money laundering, there's corruption, there's pedophilia, there's child exploitation, there's a great deal of material regarding Haiti and the theft of the Haitian earthquake funds.
[00:37:05.518 --> 00:37:12.663]  One detective told me point blank, this is Houma's blackmail file.
[00:37:12.663 --> 00:37:13.784]  And I said, you mean,
[00:37:14.927 --> 00:37:17.909]  She might blackmail Hillary and Bill.
[00:37:17.909 --> 00:37:19.190]  He said no.
[00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:24.893]  But if they ever choose to try to dump her, this is how she will stay on the payroll.
[00:37:24.893 --> 00:37:28.055]  She will stay in the first circle.
[00:37:28.055 --> 00:37:29.215]  Extraordinary, Owen.
[00:37:29.215 --> 00:37:30.096]  Really extraordinary.
[00:37:31.544 --> 00:37:48.112]  Well, and last night, you had this report coming from John Solomon at The Hill, who's been doing great work, especially when it comes to the Uranium One scandal and the, well, what was really a lack of a fair investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails.
[00:37:48.112 --> 00:37:51.514]  John Solomon writes this for The Hill last night, it gets published.
[00:37:51.514 --> 00:37:57.777]  Congressional investigators find irregularities in FBI's handling of Clinton email case.
[00:37:58.317 --> 00:38:24.924]  Now of course yesterday morning President Trump sends the tweet out as you're referring to Huma Abedin with what was found in her emails and the classified information that also made its way to pervert Wiener's servers as well and how in other similar instances the perpetrator has been put in jail that in this case would be Huma Abedin and then today
[00:38:26.445 --> 00:38:32.687]  You have a fire at Bill and Hillary's Chappaqua, New York compound.
[00:38:32.687 --> 00:38:36.188]  So, I mean, are we reaching here?
[00:38:36.188 --> 00:38:41.029]  Or is there a connection between all of these events, Roger?
[00:38:41.029 --> 00:38:48.691]  Well, there's an intermediate step that's very important here, and you can read about it in Hillary's fictional book, What Happened.
[00:38:49.568 --> 00:38:50.228]  What happened?
[00:38:50.228 --> 00:38:51.509]  Let me tell you what happened.
[00:38:51.509 --> 00:39:05.996]  People figured out that you were a mean-spirited, vile, privileged, nasty, short-tempered, foul-mouthed, and epically greedy autocrat.
[00:39:05.996 --> 00:39:12.779]  And they saw through your lifetime of crime and corruption, and they turned to a true American patriot.
[00:39:12.779 --> 00:39:16.301]  But she tells us in her book
[00:39:17.067 --> 00:39:20.955]  Uh, you know, all about what has transpired.
[00:39:20.955 --> 00:39:28.290]  Remember, whatever is in the NYPD Discover emails is so shocking to Mr. Comey.
[00:39:29.068 --> 00:39:36.875]  That he announces on the Friday before the election that he's reopening the investigation into her email case.
[00:39:36.875 --> 00:39:46.483]  Then he wants us to believe by Sunday evening that a bureau that took three years to read 330,000 documents read 750,000 documents in two days using presumably very broad keyword search engines.
[00:39:56.992 --> 00:39:59.773]  Bogus in my view.
[00:39:59.773 --> 00:40:13.915]  The people I saw and spoke with at NYPD as Infowars sources had seen the actual emails and they described them as lewd, nasty, stunning, brazen, and so on.
[00:40:13.915 --> 00:40:17.776]  So we know that they had to cover this up.
[00:40:17.776 --> 00:40:21.896]  Then Comey has us believe that there's nothing there of value.
[00:40:21.896 --> 00:40:24.777]  Now they release a small number
[00:40:26.016 --> 00:40:30.699]  If this is what Comey saw, he would not have reopened the investigation.
[00:40:30.699 --> 00:40:42.425]  This is a treasure trove that would pave the way to prison for both Clintons if they have not already done so, Owen.
[00:40:42.425 --> 00:40:47.928]  And just to put things in perspective here for the, let's just say, the Trump detractors,
[00:40:49.562 --> 00:41:07.647]  If Donald Trump refused to turn over information in the Russian investigation probe, as the DNC did, the DNC and CrowdStrike are yet to turn over their servers so that they can show who indeed hacked them, whether or not it was the Russians.
[00:41:07.647 --> 00:41:15.989]  And then two, if you look at all of the emails and the deleting of the emails and everything that took place within the Clinton campaign,
[00:41:16.929 --> 00:41:22.273]  That for sure would be considered obstruction of justice if it was Donald Trump doing it.
[00:41:22.273 --> 00:41:24.695]  However, he's not the one that did it.
[00:41:24.695 --> 00:41:26.977]  He's not the one that deleted the emails.
[00:41:26.977 --> 00:41:31.300]  He's not the one that's not cooperating with any investigation and making false claims.
[00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:33.922]  Yet he is still the target of this investigation.
[00:41:34.602 --> 00:41:36.825]  Which is why when you say, what about the fire?
[00:41:36.825 --> 00:41:39.007]  One has to say, absolutely.
[00:41:39.007 --> 00:41:45.494]  If there were a fire in a Trump golf course, they'd say he was discovering evidence, destroying evidence of Russian collusion.
[00:41:45.494 --> 00:41:48.518]  The Clintons would steal a hot stove.
[00:41:48.518 --> 00:41:50.520]  How do we know that they would destroy evidence?
[00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:54.945]  They have already done so in a crime spree that goes back almost
[00:41:55.866 --> 00:41:57.166]  40 years.
[00:41:57.166 --> 00:42:05.392]  So, yes, a fire in their home in posh Tony Chappaqua has to be viewed very suspiciously.
[00:42:05.392 --> 00:42:11.237]  Now, is it possible that Bill was in a bedroom smoking pot with one of the maids?
[00:42:11.237 --> 00:42:12.537]  Entirely possible.
[00:42:12.537 --> 00:42:14.259]  It could have been a cigar, alright?
[00:42:14.259 --> 00:42:16.961]  It could have been a cigar.
[00:42:16.961 --> 00:42:20.043]  But as he told a famous reporter, cocaine?
[00:42:20.043 --> 00:42:21.464]  What does that look like?
[00:42:22.037 --> 00:42:31.740]  Which is funny, because Roger Clinton quoted in my book that Clinton's war with women saying that his brother snorted cocaine like a vacuum cleaner.
[00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:33.841]  I've never heard of cocaine.
[00:42:33.841 --> 00:42:37.822]  It's not like people that do a bunch of cocaine's voice ends up sounding like this.
[00:42:37.822 --> 00:42:41.103]  It never happens ever, so I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:42:41.103 --> 00:42:43.584]  That was just a small fire we had today.
[00:42:43.584 --> 00:42:45.925]  It was an oven we were trying to steal from the White House.
[00:42:45.925 --> 00:42:47.025]  It was still on.
[00:42:47.025 --> 00:42:48.366]  We didn't know it was on though, Roger.
[00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:53.968]  Well, I would say this, you're no Randy Credico, but not bad.
[00:42:53.968 --> 00:42:56.954]  The great Owen Schreier, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:56.954 --> 00:42:57.535]  I'll take it.
[00:42:57.535 --> 00:42:58.136]  Thank you, Roger.
[00:42:59.304 --> 00:43:02.705]  Introducing CellForce by InfoWars Life.
[00:43:02.705 --> 00:43:06.686]  CellForce focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[00:43:06.686 --> 00:43:10.026]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[00:43:10.026 --> 00:43:12.547]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[00:43:12.547 --> 00:43:17.288]  CellForce helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[00:43:17.288 --> 00:43:19.628]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul.
[00:43:19.628 --> 00:43:26.010]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[00:43:26.650 --> 00:43:34.839]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[00:43:34.839 --> 00:43:39.904]  The antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[00:43:39.904 --> 00:43:46.891]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[00:43:47.532 --> 00:43:52.435]  Boost, protect, and adapt with Cell Force from InfoWarsLife.
[00:43:52.435 --> 00:43:55.357]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:44:00.017 --> 00:44:02.618]  Matt in Ohio, you're on the air, another Matt, go ahead.
[00:44:02.618 --> 00:44:17.225]  Yeah, hey, listen, I just wanted to say real quick, I'm a long-time listener of InfoWars, and I just wanted to say that the t-shirts that you guys are offering are absolutely fantastic, and that really is a great way to deal with this battle in the InfoWars.
[00:44:17.225 --> 00:44:24.849]  It might seem like a simple thing, but particularly these slogan t-shirts that you guys got up right now are absolutely amazing.
[00:44:24.849 --> 00:44:25.349]  Well, thank you.
[00:44:25.349 --> 00:44:26.709]  My favorite new one is the
[00:44:27.970 --> 00:44:36.492]  Don't tread on me, but said it says won't tread on me, and it's a big Dayglo snake, Gadsden snake, and then it's got the American flag, InfoWars.com on the right arm.
[00:44:36.492 --> 00:44:42.733]  I mean, that's a great way just to meet like-minded people, and spread the word, and also exercise free speech.
[00:44:42.733 --> 00:44:45.914]  And the newest one is Trigger Warning T-shirt.
[00:44:45.914 --> 00:44:52.735]  Trigger Warning T-shirt, which is the symbol of a trigger, but with a yield sign, and then InfoWars.com on the back.
[00:44:52.735 --> 00:44:57.256]  That is the new Shirt of the Month, available exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.

[00:45:26.423 --> 00:45:34.210]  This essential mineral is necessary in order to produce thyroid hormones which influence every cell, tissue and organ in the body.
[00:45:34.210 --> 00:45:41.117]  With inadequate thyroid hormones you may experience slow metabolism, lethargy, weight gain and overall brain fog.

[00:47:04.310 --> 00:47:05.990]  The War Room.
[00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:08.451]  InfoWars.com Forge slash Show.
[00:47:23.713 --> 00:47:25.414]  Welcome back.
[00:47:25.414 --> 00:47:27.694]  You are in the right place.
[00:47:27.694 --> 00:47:30.496]  This is Freedom Command Central.
[00:47:30.496 --> 00:47:38.979]  It's the War Room with Roger Stone and Owen Schroyer, part of the expanded coverage that Alex Jones has mapped out for 2018.
[00:47:41.106 --> 00:47:47.957]  You know, I know, Owen, that you, like me, are very proud of the fact that we here at InfoWars break a lot of news.
[00:47:47.957 --> 00:47:52.946]  We have been consistently ahead of the mainstream media.
[00:47:54.238 --> 00:48:17.218]  Two stories that illustrate that extremely well is the news yesterday that veteran conservative Senator Orrin Hatch would step down in Utah and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, the failed 26th Republican presidential candidate, would launch a candidacy for that seat.
[00:48:18.332 --> 00:48:28.217]  The New York Times and the Washington Post reported this as if it was a breathtaking revelation when we had reported Romney's preparation.
[00:48:28.217 --> 00:48:37.481]  And in fact, at this moment, he appears to be unchallenged in a Republican primary for that seat.
[00:48:37.481 --> 00:48:42.403]  Matt Grudge put it up only reporting the news as it is.
[00:48:42.403 --> 00:48:46.305]  So once again, InfoWars gave you the straight story.
[00:48:46.747 --> 00:48:50.229]  Weeks earlier than the mainstream media.
[00:48:50.229 --> 00:49:02.977]  Also interesting was a story in the Hill regarding, pardon me, the reversal of the president's position on troops to Afghanistan.
[00:49:03.676 --> 00:49:13.287]  We at InfoWars reported exclusively to you only weeks ago that National Security Advisor H.R.
[00:49:13.287 --> 00:49:23.338]  McMaster was attempting to get the President to sign documents authorizing a 50,000 troop allotment to Afghanistan.
[00:49:24.372 --> 00:49:35.422]  Remember, we were told we were going to have a continuing presence and that General Mattis would have discretion on the number of troops, but it was implied that it would be around 9,000.
[00:49:35.422 --> 00:49:39.946]  50,000 is the largest single deployment we have had to this doomed enterprise.
[00:49:45.635 --> 00:50:00.969]  Candidate Donald Trump knew and said that Afghanistan was a loser, a pit for American lives and money, but success there was unachievable, as the Russians and the Brits both learned.
[00:50:01.909 --> 00:50:12.496]  Ronald Reagan skillfully maneuvered the Russians into backing their paw into this mess, and it helped cost them the Cold War.
[00:50:12.496 --> 00:50:21.842]  Then we skillfully, as Americans, turned around and stepped in the very trap that we had laid for the Russians.
[00:50:21.842 --> 00:50:25.565]  Thank you, George Bush and your successors.
[00:50:26.663 --> 00:50:43.981]  So, this reversal, again, first reported at InfoWars, but confirming the largest troop allotments yet, and a ramping up, not a phasing down of our military presence.
[00:50:43.981 --> 00:50:46.524]  Once again, at InfoWars.
[00:50:46.524 --> 00:50:48.346]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:50:50.762 --> 00:51:05.428]  Well, you've done a good job keeping track of all those stories, too, Roger, that we break and then we almost forget that we broke it, you know, a month ago or months ago, and then when the mainstream media picks up on it, we kind of realize, oh yeah, we were talking about that a few months back.
[00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:19.827]  And this whole Russian collusion stuff is kind of a perfect overall example where as soon as we saw this narrative coming down the pipeline, Roger, we already knew where it came from.
[00:51:19.827 --> 00:51:23.629]  We knew where to identify the Russian dossier, Trump dossier.
[00:51:23.629 --> 00:51:24.810]  We knew how to identify that.
[00:51:24.810 --> 00:51:27.051]  That's clearly a dirty Democrat technique.
[00:51:27.051 --> 00:51:30.153]  That's clearly a Clinton fingerprint written all over it.
[00:51:30.153 --> 00:51:32.194]  We saw the tea leaves from the beginning.
[00:51:32.194 --> 00:51:33.755]  That's why, you know,
[00:51:34.676 --> 00:51:35.016]  Really?
[00:51:35.016 --> 00:51:37.317]  Oh, like, and I'm not insulting John Solomon.
[00:51:37.317 --> 00:51:38.438]  The guy does great work.
[00:51:38.438 --> 00:51:47.543]  It's just, when we see this headline, Congressional investigators find irregularities in FBI's handling of Clinton email case, it's like, duh!
[00:51:47.543 --> 00:51:48.983]  Like, duh, really?
[00:51:48.983 --> 00:51:50.424]  We've been telling you that since day one.
[00:51:50.424 --> 00:51:57.868]  How about Peter Stroke, the same guy that let Hillary Clinton and Cheryl Mills go, is saying he wants an insurance plan for the President?
[00:51:58.700 --> 00:52:00.162]  Well, let me say this.
[00:52:00.162 --> 00:52:09.272]  I think John Solomon is literally one of the very best incisive and aggressive investigative journalists out there.
[00:52:09.272 --> 00:52:17.281]  It was John Solomon who then was at Circa News who broke the extraordinary case that the Obama NSA had
[00:52:19.964 --> 00:52:30.589]  Illegally surveilled almost 39,000 Americans essentially for political purposes in an act of political espionage paid for by the taxpayers.
[00:52:30.589 --> 00:52:35.331]  That relates to the FISA warrant we talked about in the last segment.
[00:52:35.331 --> 00:52:40.133]  The fact that I was among those that were being surveilled.
[00:52:40.133 --> 00:52:43.274]  So Solomon has broken some huge stories.
[00:52:43.274 --> 00:52:44.555]  He and Sarah Carter are
[00:52:44.995 --> 00:52:53.041]  To among the two investigative journalists that I respect the most.
[00:52:53.041 --> 00:53:07.552]  In this story, I think what Solomon has done is to nail down what we first reported on, but which he has filled in many blanks and provided a great deal of documentation we did not have at the time.
[00:53:07.552 --> 00:53:10.574]  So thank God for the Hill.
[00:53:10.574 --> 00:53:14.317]  It is neither a conservative or liberal news site.
[00:53:19.466 --> 00:53:23.627]  Yeah, everything that John Solomon has been reporting on ends up coming true.
[00:53:23.627 --> 00:53:24.547]  Same with Sarah Carter.
[00:53:24.547 --> 00:53:25.968]  Again, they were both at Circa News.
[00:53:25.968 --> 00:53:27.808]  John Solomon now with The Hill.
[00:53:27.808 --> 00:53:31.969]  Another reporter that's been doing great work, Chuck Ross for The Daily Caller.
[00:53:31.969 --> 00:53:34.510]  He puts out this piece today.
[00:53:34.510 --> 00:53:38.791]  Senate panel hits back at Fusion GPS over op-ed claims.
[00:53:38.791 --> 00:53:42.793]  Spokesman for Chuck Grassley says that Fusion GPS asked during August 22nd
[00:53:44.173 --> 00:53:45.674]  I guess it was a hearing.
[00:53:45.674 --> 00:53:55.018]  For the transcript, for that transcript to be kept confidential and then Glenn Simpson of Fusion GPS declined an invitation for an open hearing.
[00:53:55.018 --> 00:54:05.542]  So this is Fusion GPS now, Roger, that is realizing that the heat is on them and they're trying to avoid any toxicity of this whole thing as well.
[00:54:06.806 --> 00:54:09.306]  Well, it is extraordinary.
[00:54:09.306 --> 00:54:10.267]  The worm is turning.
[00:54:10.267 --> 00:54:30.010]  We also have stunning news of my old partner and boyhood friend Paul Manafort's lawsuit against the bogus conduct of an investigation by Robert Mueller and the FBI, in this case, DOJ.
[00:54:30.010 --> 00:54:36.071]  Manafort and his lawyers have been keeping thread, as they say, for many, many months.
[00:54:36.773 --> 00:54:41.455]  Manafort's civil liberties have been systematically violated.
[00:54:41.455 --> 00:54:44.016]  His due process has been violated.
[00:54:44.016 --> 00:54:51.638]  The thug tactics of Mueller's bully boy hit squad have violated his constitutional rights.
[00:54:51.638 --> 00:54:58.321]  And I always believed there was a lawsuit or series of devastating lawsuits coming.
[00:54:58.974 --> 00:55:08.618]  Manafort is a feisty Italian-American, and he said from the beginning he would not plead guilty to things that he had not done.
[00:55:08.618 --> 00:55:16.502]  He refused the entreaties of the special counsel to simply roll on Donald Trump.
[00:55:16.502 --> 00:55:22.324]  We'll make all your tax problems, all your money laundering problems, if they're real, go away.
[00:55:22.324 --> 00:55:24.105]  Just give us the president.
[00:55:24.105 --> 00:55:28.307]  Just tell us that you colluded with the Russians and Trump knew everything.
[00:55:28.982 --> 00:55:34.944]  Manafort has refused to do this because to do so, he would have to lie.
[00:55:34.944 --> 00:55:37.005]  He would have to perjure himself.
[00:55:37.005 --> 00:55:53.170]  And now, Manafort strikes back in a devastating lawsuit that cuts to the heart of the abuse of power by Mueller and the Justice Department in this incredible witch hunt.
[00:55:53.170 --> 00:55:56.111]  And this is obviously going to be a story we're going to keep tabs on.
[00:55:57.751 --> 00:56:02.976]  And as I'm... I didn't even make this connection until just now hearing you talk about this.
[00:56:02.976 --> 00:56:13.365]  I'm wondering if there's any connection here with this lawsuit to the timing of this excoriation of Steve Bannon today.
[00:56:13.365 --> 00:56:19.991]  It was Steve Bannon, essentially in these alleged direct quotes in the book that came out, saying
[00:56:21.101 --> 00:56:30.871]  Manafort was laundering money to Russia through an intermediary, Jared Kushner, and that gets published apparently straight out of the mouth of Steve Bannon.
[00:56:30.871 --> 00:56:33.935]  He's yet to say that that quote isn't real.
[00:56:33.935 --> 00:56:39.901]  Breitbart actually ended up publishing that quote as if it were real, so who knows the story there.
[00:56:39.901 --> 00:56:43.525]  But I'm just curious now, I'm wondering if the timing of this
[00:56:44.747 --> 00:57:01.458]  Is someone orchestrated because it's an awfully great coincidence that the same day Manafort is suing back against the Mueller probe for entrapment, you've got Bannon saying that Manafort and Kushner are guilty.
[00:57:01.458 --> 00:57:04.100]  So that's just a weird another ripple that we have in this deal.
[00:57:04.860 --> 00:57:05.201]  Indeed.
[00:57:05.201 --> 00:57:10.624]  Look, I'm not going to criticize Steve Bannon because I don't think infighting in the movement is a good idea.
[00:57:10.624 --> 00:57:12.186]  I agree with Steve on many things.
[00:57:12.186 --> 00:57:14.908]  I disagree with him on others.
[00:57:14.908 --> 00:57:20.872]  He was, you know, he was addressed in the worst addressed list in a jovial manner.
[00:57:21.572 --> 00:57:31.840]  And I must say this, Michael Wolff, the author of this book, has a notorious reputation for falsification of words, lying, and making things up.
[00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:35.062]  So I'm going to give Bannon the benefit of the doubt.
[00:57:35.062 --> 00:57:36.223]  I do know this.
[00:57:36.223 --> 00:57:40.987]  Paul Manafort was not laundering money through Jared Kushner to Russia.
[00:57:40.987 --> 00:57:44.610]  It doesn't even make sense.
[00:57:44.610 --> 00:57:46.171]  All right, there goes Roger Stone.
[00:57:46.171 --> 00:57:47.031]  This is The War Room.
[00:57:47.031 --> 00:57:47.632]  We'll be right back.

[00:59:01.984 --> 00:59:03.364]  So what do we do about it?
[00:59:03.364 --> 00:59:06.685]  Well, for starters, don't just sit there and take it.

[01:00:03.177 --> 01:00:08.599]  The silent majority is no longer silent.
[01:00:08.599 --> 01:00:14.102]  This is The War Room with Owens Troyer at infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:00:24.892 --> 01:00:27.193]  Welcome back to the War Room.
[01:00:27.193 --> 01:00:36.978]  I've got a series of video clips here that prove what Roger Stone was talking about here on the War Room months ago.
[01:00:36.978 --> 01:00:48.665]  That is, they are trying to invoke the 25th Amendment against President Trump in order to remove him from office.
[01:00:48.665 --> 01:00:50.866]  I've also got a stack of news on that.
[01:00:52.361 --> 01:01:01.230]  Especially when it comes to the tweet about or I guess against Kim Jong-un talking about the size of their red button.
[01:01:05.131 --> 01:01:16.442]  But, let's first start with this clip because, I mean, let's go full on, let's just get the craziest out there before we even get into the something that actually has a little substance to it.
[01:01:16.442 --> 01:01:19.145]  I mean, at least they are responding to a tweet.
[01:01:19.145 --> 01:01:21.987]  But this is a MSNBC clip.
[01:01:22.648 --> 01:01:28.272]  Where they say that Trump's sexual insecurity is threatening to annihilate the planet.
[01:01:28.272 --> 01:01:28.892]  This is true.
[01:01:28.892 --> 01:01:37.157]  His sexual insecurity, folks, here is MSNBC going, well, full Trump derangement syndrome.
[01:01:37.157 --> 01:01:46.082]  This interesting thought from Donald Trump about the size of his nuclear button and the threat that he just put up against the North Korean leader.
[01:01:46.082 --> 01:01:46.463]  Your thoughts?
[01:01:47.063 --> 01:01:56.768]  As we saw all through 2017, men with profound sexual insecurity can wreak a lot of havoc in the lives of women, in the lives of their families.
[01:01:56.768 --> 01:02:02.491]  But perhaps never have we seen men with profound sexual and masculine insecurities.
[01:02:02.491 --> 01:02:04.171]  Take a pause right there.
[01:02:04.171 --> 01:02:08.494]  This is the funniest thing that I find about mainstream news.
[01:02:08.494 --> 01:02:12.976]  And this is why InfoWars is so popular amongst thinking individuals.
[01:02:14.224 --> 01:02:14.885]  Think about this.
[01:02:14.885 --> 01:02:17.588]  This is how MSNBC conducts this segment.
[01:02:17.588 --> 01:02:25.278]  Okay, we've got this talking point here that Trump is sexually insecure and that's why he sent out the red button tweet to Kim Jong-un.
[01:02:25.278 --> 01:02:27.061]  So they're like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:02:27.061 --> 01:02:28.362]  And so that's their talking point.
[01:02:29.488 --> 01:02:37.932]  So then this conehead-looking individual has to get up here and just force a conversation like, well, yeah, I mean, clearly he's sexually insecure.
[01:02:37.932 --> 01:02:39.213]  I mean, I've read the tweet.
[01:02:39.213 --> 01:02:41.014]  We've heard about the small hands.
[01:02:41.014 --> 01:02:42.575]  He responded to the small hands.
[01:02:42.575 --> 01:02:47.857]  And so they're up here pontificating over a nothing burger, over a talking point.
[01:02:47.857 --> 01:02:49.598]  We don't do talking points here.
[01:02:49.598 --> 01:02:51.920]  We do critical thinking and analysis.
[01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:54.341]  Let's go back to the talking point conehead.
[01:02:55.009 --> 01:02:55.089]  What?! !
[01:03:18.117 --> 01:03:19.158]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:03:19.158 --> 01:03:21.280]  I don't know who that goon is.
[01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:23.662]  I wonder, I mean, I don't know.
[01:03:23.662 --> 01:03:28.205]  Anand Giriharadas.
[01:03:28.205 --> 01:03:35.171]  Arad Giriharadas reports on the nuclear meltdown at Fukushima.
[01:03:35.171 --> 01:03:37.633]  I mean, he's sitting here talking about an uninhabitable planet.
[01:03:37.633 --> 01:03:47.061]  Okay, how about the nuclear radiation just leaking into the Pacific Ocean non-stop for almost 10 years now, is it?
[01:03:48.872 --> 01:03:55.194]  But it trumps sexual insecurity as a threat to a habitable planet.
[01:03:55.194 --> 01:04:00.876]  How about all the chemicals that we know they spray in the atmosphere, that they put in the water.
[01:04:00.876 --> 01:04:01.676]  I mean, think about that.
[01:04:01.676 --> 01:04:05.497]  They put chemicals in the water.
[01:04:05.497 --> 01:04:09.939]  That is a basic element for all of life on this planet.
[01:04:11.075 --> 01:04:31.968]  So they poison the water supply that we drink, they poison the water supply that we use to water our plants, water our animals, but Trump's sexuality is insecure, and that is a threat to the habitable planet that we live on.
[01:04:31.968 --> 01:04:36.570]  But Kim Jong-un, though, isn't the threat.
[01:04:36.570 --> 01:04:37.411]  It's President Trump.
[01:04:38.939 --> 01:04:43.702]  Now again, I'm not even sitting here saying whether I like these tweets or dislike these tweets.
[01:04:43.702 --> 01:04:47.044]  Just neutral on that subject.
[01:04:47.044 --> 01:04:48.045]  It's just sad.
[01:04:48.045 --> 01:04:49.206]  This is how I miss it.
[01:04:49.206 --> 01:04:58.351]  So Trump then tweets out, I will be announcing the most dishonest and corrupt media awards of the year Monday at 5 o'clock.
[01:04:58.351 --> 01:05:00.573]  Pike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide, go ahead.
[01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:03.422]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[01:05:03.422 --> 01:05:13.931]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[01:05:13.931 --> 01:05:17.294]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks.
[01:05:17.774 --> 01:05:18.094]  Absolutely.
[01:05:40.211 --> 01:05:53.445]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[01:06:14.139 --> 01:06:16.067]  This is the War Room!
[01:06:29.105 --> 01:06:38.974]  So you first heard it reported at Infowars.com the Deep State would be trying to invoke the 25th Amendment and have President Trump removed from office.
[01:06:38.974 --> 01:06:41.016]  They're laying the groundwork for that right now.
[01:06:41.016 --> 01:06:42.777]  They don't quite have the votes.
[01:06:42.777 --> 01:06:44.799]  They do believe they can get the votes in the midterms.
[01:06:44.799 --> 01:06:48.122]  They'll be sadly mistaking on that.
[01:06:48.122 --> 01:06:49.964]  But Trump tweets this out yesterday.
[01:06:51.300 --> 01:06:56.664]  He says, I will be announcing the most dishonest and corrupt media awards of the year on Monday at five o'clock.
[01:06:56.664 --> 01:06:58.385]  I'm assuming that's next week.
[01:06:58.385 --> 01:07:03.569]  Subjects will cover dishonesty and bad reporting in various categories from the fake news media.
[01:07:03.569 --> 01:07:05.831]  Stay tuned.
[01:07:05.831 --> 01:07:08.693]  Is President Trump serious about this?
[01:07:08.693 --> 01:07:10.754]  I'm certainly looking forward to it.
[01:07:10.754 --> 01:07:14.817]  In fact, he probably is saying that's going to be Monday, five o'clock Eastern.
[01:07:14.817 --> 01:07:17.539]  That's four o'clock Central when the war room is live.
[01:07:17.539 --> 01:07:20.001]  So next Monday, we might be live when President Trump
[01:07:21.027 --> 01:07:39.798]  I guess move forward with this plan for the most dishonest media but you can really see how they operate as we were playing that last MSNBC clip and we've got another NBC clip we've got a Fox Business clip we've got a CNN clip here but you can see
[01:07:41.337 --> 01:07:44.859]  What I was talking about in the last segment, how they have a talking point.
[01:07:44.859 --> 01:07:50.921]  It's not about, here's the research that I did, or here's what my sources are saying, or here's how this is developing.
[01:07:50.921 --> 01:07:55.183]  It's, here's a Democrat created talking point, now let's pontificate on it.
[01:07:55.183 --> 01:07:56.524]  Okay, what's the talking point?
[01:07:56.524 --> 01:08:03.347]  Trump's crazy, and he has a small man part, and that's why he is tweeting to Kim Jong-un.
[01:08:03.347 --> 01:08:03.827]  Okay, go!
[01:08:05.305 --> 01:08:10.767]  And so there they go, and then the talking point is created, and then it manifests itself.
[01:08:10.767 --> 01:08:16.409]  Of course, I mean, Trump did create it by saying what he said in the tweet, which was, Okay.
[01:08:34.013 --> 01:08:44.237]  Now, Kim Jong-un has actually responded to that by trying to reach out to have talks with Seoul and South Korea, but regardless, look at how they respond.
[01:08:44.237 --> 01:08:49.740]  This is because they're trying to invoke the 25th Amendment, as we reported months ago.
[01:08:49.740 --> 01:08:55.522]  CNN says, why Twitter won't block Trump despite his nuclear threats?
[01:08:55.522 --> 01:08:56.903]  Oh, it's a nuclear threat now!
[01:08:57.671 --> 01:09:07.920]  It's a nuclear threat now when he's trying to stop the nuclear threat that is the radical North Korean regime.
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:09.821]  Trump's the bad guy.
[01:09:09.821 --> 01:09:14.265]  But yeah, they want Twitter to block President Trump for sure, which I actually have decided now.
[01:09:14.265 --> 01:09:15.406]  I hope Twitter does block Trump.
[01:09:16.531 --> 01:09:24.838]  I would love for Twitter to block President Trump because the first thing he does is either start a new social network of his own or move to Gab.
[01:09:24.838 --> 01:09:27.980]  Either one of those formulas means Twitter dies.
[01:09:27.980 --> 01:09:30.522]  So please, Twitter, block President Trump.
[01:09:30.522 --> 01:09:31.603]  But they're smarter than that.
[01:09:31.603 --> 01:09:34.305]  They know that Trump is the only reason why they're probably not going under.
[01:09:35.851 --> 01:09:40.813]  You've got Hillary's spokesman calls for Trump to be banned from Twitter over Newt tweet.
[01:09:40.813 --> 01:09:42.094]  That's Brian Fallon.
[01:09:42.094 --> 01:09:42.754]  So there you go.
[01:09:42.754 --> 01:09:43.595]  Yeah.
[01:09:43.595 --> 01:09:44.915]  Oh, how dare he?
[01:09:44.915 --> 01:09:58.802]  We've got all of these good racist liberals tweeting death to President Trump, tweeting death to white people, you know, insulting his family, saying things about Barron, but Trump needs to be banned for addressing the North Korean situation.
[01:09:58.802 --> 01:10:04.805]  Morning Joe, Trump's nuclear button tweet suggests President is demented and deranged.
[01:10:05.795 --> 01:10:06.716]  Oh.
[01:10:06.716 --> 01:10:10.959]  I thought they were talking about Mika and Joe as demented and deranged.
[01:10:10.959 --> 01:10:11.780]  But no, I was wrong.
[01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:12.520]  It was actually Trump.
[01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:13.401]  I should have known that, though.
[01:10:13.401 --> 01:10:16.123]  That's just one of their favorite talking points.
[01:10:16.123 --> 01:10:27.212]  You've got The View goes off on Trump's intensely phallic, intensely phallic, they say, nuclear brag needs to be medicated and hospitalized.
[01:10:27.212 --> 01:10:30.695]  Again, that's probably the entire staff of The View, but I digress.
[01:10:30.695 --> 01:10:31.435]  Joy Baer says,
[01:10:32.389 --> 01:10:37.792]  Trump needs to be medicated and hospitalized at this point or he's just going to kill all of us.
[01:10:37.792 --> 01:10:52.361]  Well I would base, I would say my conclusion based on what you said is that you are the one that indeed needs to be medicated and hospitalized and probably put in a straight jacket in a rubber room before you kill yourself.
[01:10:52.361 --> 01:10:58.985]  So then she speculates he'll blow the whole world up so that his stupid sons don't have to go to jail.
[01:10:59.926 --> 01:11:04.068]  Boy, she really brought into that Russian collusion thing, didn't poor Joy Bayer.
[01:11:04.068 --> 01:11:08.611]  Yeah, we told you that's what they were going to try to do.
[01:11:08.611 --> 01:11:08.891]  So now...
[01:11:20.290 --> 01:11:24.513]  You just heard from MSNBC his sexual insecurity.
[01:11:24.513 --> 01:11:26.694]  I mean, he's clearly sexually insecure.
[01:11:26.694 --> 01:11:34.419]  I mean, how could you possibly land a wife like Melania unless you're sexually insecure?
[01:11:34.419 --> 01:11:39.242]  I mean, a woman like that, you just need no security at all to try to approach a woman like that.
[01:11:39.242 --> 01:11:43.805]  So clearly the MSNBC really knows what they're talking about there.
[01:11:43.805 --> 01:11:49.589]  But this is NBC saying that Trump's tweet could provoke Kim Jong-un.
[01:11:51.989 --> 01:11:57.153]  These juvenile and immature and destabilizing tweets kind of suggest that.
[01:11:57.153 --> 01:12:03.758]  And Kim Jong-un is far more likely to lash out, to attack South Korea, to attack Japan, to use his chemical weapons.
[01:12:03.758 --> 01:12:05.060]  So he's the crazy one then?
[01:12:05.060 --> 01:12:06.821]  Sounds to me like he's the crazy one.
[01:12:06.821 --> 01:12:13.506]  So I think this is very destabilizing and this is a tweet that could lead to confrontation and maybe even war.
[01:12:13.506 --> 01:12:18.750]  So it's kind of like the whole radical Islam thing where they'll say,
[01:12:19.861 --> 01:12:28.308]  You know, don't try to close the borders or, you know, don't say bad things about Muslim countries, otherwise they're going to try to stab you and kill you.
[01:12:28.308 --> 01:12:31.590]  And you're like, what?
[01:12:31.590 --> 01:12:32.671]  It's like the same thing here.
[01:12:32.671 --> 01:12:38.796]  It's like, well, President Trump needs to not talk about Kim Jong-un like that because he could use a chemical weapon.
[01:12:40.222 --> 01:12:42.344]  So he's the bad guy?
[01:12:42.344 --> 01:12:43.825]  Or... Oh.
[01:12:43.825 --> 01:12:46.147]  Okay, well, maybe they'll figure that one out.
[01:12:46.147 --> 01:12:48.188]  Maybe they'll just go to North Korea.
[01:12:48.188 --> 01:12:48.909]  How about that?
[01:12:48.909 --> 01:12:52.151]  Why don't they try to get a comment from Kim Jong-un?
[01:12:52.151 --> 01:12:54.633]  Oh, because he's a radical dictator and won't talk to you.
[01:12:54.633 --> 01:12:55.354]  Oh.
[01:12:55.354 --> 01:12:57.395]  Okay, sorry, I forgot about that aspect.
[01:12:57.395 --> 01:13:05.442]  Here's Brian Stelter, George Costanza of CNN Fake News, questioning President Trump's mental fitness.
[01:13:06.482 --> 01:13:09.643]  Joining us now is CNN Senior Media Correspondent Brian Stelter.
[01:13:09.643 --> 01:13:11.363]  Any idea exactly what he's talking about?
[01:13:11.363 --> 01:13:13.924]  This is something he seemed to propose before the New Year, Anderson.
[01:13:13.924 --> 01:13:16.944]  The idea of a fake news trophy that should be awarded.
[01:13:16.944 --> 01:13:18.785]  The RNC... Oh, you'll be on there, buddy!
[01:13:18.785 --> 01:13:20.745]  ...said they would take nominations.
[01:13:20.745 --> 01:13:27.267]  It seems the president, right out of reality TV here, wants to create a moment of drama where he'll announce the winners.
[01:13:27.267 --> 01:13:29.867]  Obviously, in the grand scheme of things... Okay, pause it right there.
[01:13:29.867 --> 01:13:30.408]  Pause it right there.
[01:13:30.408 --> 01:13:32.048]  Let's just make sure that we recognize here.
[01:13:33.108 --> 01:13:39.792]  I would say CNN and MSNBC probably have the most nominations as we prepare for President Trump's Fake News Awards.
[01:13:39.792 --> 01:13:43.014]  Alright, let's go back to one of the fakest names in news, Brian Stelter.
[01:13:43.014 --> 01:13:46.356]  ...the day, but this came just a few minutes after the nuclear button tweet.
[01:13:46.356 --> 01:13:48.137]  So, what's on the President's mind?
[01:13:48.137 --> 01:13:49.758]  We know what's on the President's mind.
[01:13:49.758 --> 01:13:54.160]  Sixteen tweets today to start the new year, some of them deeply disturbing.
[01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:57.803]  Right, I mean, considering how the new year has started... Deeply disturbing.
[01:13:57.803 --> 01:13:59.764]  I mean, what does this say about the year?
[01:14:00.644 --> 01:14:01.684]  Madness!
[01:14:01.684 --> 01:14:03.745]  And I think we should start to call it that, shouldn't we?
[01:14:03.745 --> 01:14:13.386]  You know, when President Trump was inaugurated last January, some writers, some columnists like Andrew Sullivan started right away to raise concerns about the President's mental health, about his fitness.
[01:14:13.386 --> 01:14:13.987]  Oh!
[01:14:13.987 --> 01:14:17.567]  In the months that followed, we saw Republican senators like Jeff Flake.
[01:14:17.567 --> 01:14:18.727]  By the way, pause it right there.
[01:14:18.727 --> 01:14:24.449]  This is the same Brian Stelter, the George Costanza of news.
[01:14:24.449 --> 01:14:26.029]  These are the same people that were
[01:14:27.719 --> 01:14:31.344]  Offended that anyone would report on Hillary Clinton's health.
[01:14:31.344 --> 01:14:32.305]  Do you remember that?
[01:14:32.305 --> 01:14:36.571]  Do you remember how offended they were when people were reporting on Hillary Clinton's health?
[01:14:36.571 --> 01:14:38.614]  That's funny how that works.
[01:14:38.614 --> 01:14:39.575]  It's funny how that works.
[01:14:39.575 --> 01:14:43.481]  You're telling me that a racist liberal on CNN has double standards?
[01:14:44.942 --> 01:14:46.083]  Shocking!
[01:14:46.083 --> 01:14:48.784]  Let's go back to George Costanza, I mean Brian Stelter.
[01:14:59.241 --> 01:15:04.786]  If this were the leader of Germany or China or Brazil, what would we say?
[01:15:04.786 --> 01:15:06.788]  How would we cover these tweets?
[01:15:06.788 --> 01:15:09.471]  We would say, these are the messages from a person who is not well.
[01:15:09.471 --> 01:15:11.813]  From a leader who is not fit for office.
[01:15:11.813 --> 01:15:16.878]  Well, I mean, the counter-argument to that is, look, he just has a different style.
[01:15:16.878 --> 01:15:23.565]  Interesting, Brian Stelter, because... Do you even report on anything else other than Trump?
[01:15:25.319 --> 01:15:27.240]  I mean, it's a nice proposal that you make.
[01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:29.541]  It's a nice concept, you know.
[01:15:29.541 --> 01:15:36.405]  But have you reported on anything else other than your strange obsession with President Trump?
[01:15:36.405 --> 01:15:38.246]  That's the other thing about this.
[01:15:38.246 --> 01:15:43.669]  Brian Stelter is so obsessed with President Trump, he would live in his jock if he could.
[01:15:43.669 --> 01:15:46.850]  He would literally live in President Trump's underwear if he could.
[01:15:46.850 --> 01:15:48.871]  That's how obsessed with Donald Trump they are.
[01:15:48.871 --> 01:15:52.233]  But Brian Stelter might get around to covering some other foreign leader.
[01:15:52.233 --> 01:15:52.934]  Maybe.
[01:15:52.934 --> 01:15:53.514]  We'll find out.
[01:15:57.663 --> 01:16:03.525]  2017 has been a earth-shaking year.
[01:16:03.525 --> 01:16:06.706]  And 2018, guaranteed, is even gonna be wilder.
[01:16:06.706 --> 01:16:11.487]  In fact, my good friend, Stefan Molyneux, said it's gonna be like the Battle of the Gods, Ragnarok.
[01:16:11.487 --> 01:16:13.507]  So get ready, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:16:13.507 --> 01:16:25.831]  And that's why, thanking you for all your support, we are extending free shipping store-wide at infowarestore.com into early January, and the massive 50 to 67% off all our best-selling items.

[01:16:57.873 --> 01:17:03.016]  Introducing Floralife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by InfoWars Life.
[01:17:03.016 --> 01:17:07.778]  After years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same.
[01:17:07.778 --> 01:17:12.300]  Floralife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach
[01:17:12.540 --> 01:17:13.000]  I think so.
[01:17:32.807 --> 01:17:36.408]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[01:17:36.408 --> 01:17:41.150]  That's why increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[01:17:41.150 --> 01:17:49.232]  Floralife is sold as a 15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care and a 50 billion probiotic for a 30-day advanced gut restoration program.
[01:17:49.232 --> 01:17:53.434]  Head to infowarslife.com to pick up your bottle of Floralife probiotics today.

[01:17:58.579 --> 01:18:01.982]  Introducing CellForce by InfoWars Life.
[01:18:01.982 --> 01:18:05.966]  CellForce focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[01:18:05.966 --> 01:18:09.309]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[01:18:09.309 --> 01:18:11.831]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[01:18:11.831 --> 01:18:16.575]  CellForce helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[01:18:16.575 --> 01:18:18.917]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul.
[01:18:18.917 --> 01:18:25.303]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[01:18:25.923 --> 01:18:34.107]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[01:18:34.107 --> 01:18:39.169]  The antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[01:18:39.169 --> 01:18:46.152]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[01:18:46.812 --> 01:18:51.716]  Boost, protect and adapt with CellForce from InfoWars Life.
[01:18:51.716 --> 01:18:58.482]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:18:58.482 --> 01:19:08.832]  We have developed with the top firms in the United States powerful 50 billion live organism probiotic flora life that is so critical
[01:19:10.168 --> 01:19:12.789]  To having a healthy gut and a healthy life.
[01:19:12.789 --> 01:19:16.090]  And it has changed my life and so many other people's lives.
[01:19:16.090 --> 01:19:25.772]  The other part is a compound like MycoZx that has all these key ingredients of organic herbs and other systems that are known to break down this garbage in the body.
[01:19:25.772 --> 01:19:35.555]  That's why as we go through Christmas and now into the new year, we're extending the free shipping and 50% off on all our best-selling items while supplies last.
[01:19:35.555 --> 01:19:37.696]  You can also get the two products together
[01:19:38.675 --> 01:19:42.696]  And get them at 50% off when you combo them.
[01:19:42.696 --> 01:19:44.897]  So popular, sold out for more than six months.
[01:19:44.897 --> 01:19:50.718]  Now back in stock for a limited time at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLive.com, or by calling toll-free, AAA253-3139.
[01:19:50.718 --> 01:19:51.499]  The War Room.
[01:19:51.499 --> 01:19:52.299]  InfoWars.com, forge slash show.
[01:20:21.735 --> 01:20:33.811]  Okay, now we've seen the signs of movement against the Deep State, and now we're actually starting to get some rubber meeting the road here.
[01:20:33.811 --> 01:20:38.437]  You've got Manafort about to, or has filed a lawsuit against the Mueller probe.
[01:20:39.398 --> 01:20:42.260]  And then also, this just broke today.
[01:20:42.260 --> 01:20:47.865]  From the Hill, Rosenstein meeting with Paul Ryan about Russia investigation.
[01:20:47.865 --> 01:20:50.467]  That is a confirmed meeting that happened.
[01:20:50.467 --> 01:20:51.768]  Christopher Wray was supposed to be there.
[01:20:51.768 --> 01:20:56.011]  It was not confirmed that he did actually show up.
[01:20:56.011 --> 01:21:00.315]  So you have to wonder what that is about.
[01:21:01.986 --> 01:21:05.648]  Why was Rosenstein meeting with Paul Ryan?
[01:21:05.648 --> 01:21:17.676]  This, of course, the day after, or the day of, Mueller's now lawsuit against him from Manafort.
[01:21:17.676 --> 01:21:23.400]  The day after Trump says Hillary's top aide Huma Abedin belongs in jail.
[01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:27.163]  The same day that Hillary Clinton's house catches on fire.
[01:21:27.163 --> 01:21:28.784]  Folks, are you starting to see here?
[01:21:31.092 --> 01:21:32.553]  Buckle up, baby!
[01:21:32.553 --> 01:21:32.754]  It's 2018!
[01:21:32.754 --> 01:21:41.622]  The other story from the Hill today, Congressional investigators find irregularity in FBI's handling of Clinton email case.
[01:21:41.622 --> 01:21:43.504]  Well, yeah!
[01:21:43.504 --> 01:21:45.346]  Peter Stroke wrote her off?
[01:21:45.346 --> 01:21:47.267]  James Comey wrote her off?
[01:21:47.267 --> 01:21:55.675]  Yeah, she broke the law, but we changed the terminology in the investigation so that she could walk.
[01:21:55.675 --> 01:21:56.176]  Okay.
[01:21:57.990 --> 01:22:06.474]  Yeah, Bill and Hillary kind of realized the heat was really on and that the sun is really setting on their crime spree.
[01:22:06.474 --> 01:22:10.476]  So they nearly burnt their house down today.
[01:22:10.476 --> 01:22:12.837]  Yeah.
[01:22:12.837 --> 01:22:14.097]  Yeah.
[01:22:14.097 --> 01:22:18.940]  Yeah, it's all starting to move in the direction we expected the whole time.
[01:22:18.940 --> 01:22:21.301]  And people are starting to get it.
[01:22:23.413 --> 01:22:27.317]  This is a clip of Newt Gingrich on Fox Business.
[01:22:27.317 --> 01:22:30.120]  And again, think what you want about Newt Gingrich.
[01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:42.072]  He was the one who originally said on Fox News, it was shocking to me that he said it, that the reason why the media and the establishment is against Trump is because he's not in the secret societies.
[01:22:43.302 --> 01:22:44.362]  I think things are happening.
[01:22:44.362 --> 01:22:46.523]  I think the Congress is doing its job.
[01:22:46.523 --> 01:22:50.625]  I think the news media has begun to realize this is a gigantic story.
[01:22:50.625 --> 01:22:58.749]  Certainly John Sullivan and others have been doing an amazing job of piecing it together despite enormous resistance from the elite media.
[01:22:58.749 --> 01:23:02.050]  Look, there are two things I take out of this as a historian.
[01:23:02.050 --> 01:23:08.633]  One is, we now understand how close we came to a real disaster if Hillary had won.
[01:23:08.633 --> 01:23:09.293]  Pause it right there.
[01:23:09.293 --> 01:23:10.374]  This is actually the key.
[01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:21.366]  You have to remember, when breaking all this down, I actually thought, I really thought long and hard about this last night, and we're almost to the point where we have all the connections.
[01:23:21.366 --> 01:23:23.928]  We're pretty much there, we know the names, we know the dates.
[01:23:23.928 --> 01:23:31.853]  If you follow this broadcast, you follow M4s, you follow, you know, Real News with Dave Knight and the Alex Jones Show, you pretty much know what's going on here.
[01:23:31.853 --> 01:23:34.555]  But where does this all originate?
[01:23:34.555 --> 01:23:35.776]  This is what you need to remember.
[01:23:35.776 --> 01:23:37.137]  What is the base?
[01:23:37.137 --> 01:23:38.498]  What is the foundation?
[01:23:38.498 --> 01:23:38.878]  Why?
[01:23:41.127 --> 01:23:49.235]  Folks, Hillary Clinton had to win to cover up her massive crimes.
[01:23:49.235 --> 01:23:52.018]  That's what the basis for all of this is.
[01:23:52.018 --> 01:23:54.100]  That's the desperate campaign.
[01:23:54.100 --> 01:23:57.063]  That's the desperate collusion with the mainstream media.
[01:23:57.063 --> 01:23:58.344]  That's the desperate lies.
[01:23:58.624 --> 01:24:02.186]  That's the desperate collusion with the Obama DOJ.
[01:24:02.186 --> 01:24:05.108]  That's the desperate collusion with the Obama FBI.
[01:24:05.108 --> 01:24:07.589]  That's the desperation burning your house.
[01:24:07.589 --> 01:24:10.411]  That's your desperation erasing emails.
[01:24:10.411 --> 01:24:12.793]  That's your desperation smashing servers.
[01:24:12.793 --> 01:24:16.495]  That's your desperation not turning over servers in this investigation.
[01:24:16.815 --> 01:24:18.376]  Do you see what's going on?
[01:24:18.376 --> 01:24:31.867]  So Hillary Clinton, a mountain of criminal activity behind her, has to become president so that she doesn't go to jail, has to become president so that she hopes she can get away with all the crimes she committed.
[01:24:31.867 --> 01:24:33.008]  She loses.
[01:24:33.008 --> 01:24:34.810]  The entire thing falls apart.
[01:24:34.810 --> 01:24:37.232]  The FBI collusion gets exposed.
[01:24:37.232 --> 01:24:39.694]  The mainstream media collusion gets exposed.
[01:24:39.694 --> 01:24:41.475]  It's all exposed in the WikiLeaks.
[01:24:41.475 --> 01:24:43.997]  It's all exposed in the Project Veritas videos.
[01:24:43.997 --> 01:24:45.359]  Now the reports keep coming out.
[01:24:46.215 --> 01:24:47.956]  It's over for her!
[01:24:47.956 --> 01:24:49.857]  So she gets more desperate and more desperate.
[01:24:49.857 --> 01:24:50.818]  What's next?
[01:24:50.818 --> 01:24:52.659]  Her house is already on fire.
[01:24:52.659 --> 01:24:53.180]  What's next?
[01:24:53.180 --> 01:24:55.761]  The entire DNC is going to burn down?
[01:24:55.761 --> 01:24:58.763]  Here, let's go back to Newt Gingrich who first said it.
[01:24:58.763 --> 01:25:00.885]  Trump is not in the secret societies.
[01:25:01.545 --> 01:25:04.586]  This would have been swept under the rug.
[01:25:04.586 --> 01:25:08.588]  The system would have continued to decay into corruption and dishonesty.
[01:25:08.588 --> 01:25:11.389]  Cronyism would have continued to grow.
[01:25:11.389 --> 01:25:20.192]  And in that sense, Trump is a disruptive figure who's breaking up the insider deals, the insider corruption, the kind of things that are clearly criminal behavior.
[01:25:20.192 --> 01:25:22.133]  I think that's important to remember.
[01:25:22.133 --> 01:25:22.893]  The second thing is,
[01:25:23.553 --> 01:25:26.736]  This goes to the heart of the American system.
[01:25:26.736 --> 01:25:29.979]  We have to rely on the rule of law.
[01:25:29.979 --> 01:25:32.001]  We're a very diverse country.
[01:25:32.001 --> 01:25:33.262]  We have enormous potential.
[01:25:33.262 --> 01:25:34.082]  And so pause right there.
[01:25:34.082 --> 01:25:35.363]  So this is all out in the open.
[01:25:36.374 --> 01:25:47.202]  Everyone knows it with a brain, and who can read, and so we see the collusion, we see the corruption, and so that's why President Trump tweets these things out, like, jail for Huma Abedin.
[01:25:47.202 --> 01:25:51.204]  That's why he tweets these things out, like, investigate Lyon James Comey.
[01:25:51.204 --> 01:25:56.508]  That's why he tweets these things out, like, maybe the FBI and the DOJ need investigated.
[01:25:56.508 --> 01:25:58.309]  That's like his bat signal.
[01:25:58.309 --> 01:26:00.231]  That's like he's the lighthouse.
[01:26:00.231 --> 01:26:03.413]  He's telling you he knows what's going on.
[01:26:03.413 --> 01:26:04.654]  He's not ignoring this.
[01:26:07.406 --> 01:26:13.169]  And while it is frustrating, and I've said it here dozens of times, every day Hillary Clinton walks free, I lose tolerance.
[01:26:13.169 --> 01:26:17.451]  But you can see, it's inching closer and closer.
[01:26:17.451 --> 01:26:19.292]  The more details are coming out.
[01:26:19.292 --> 01:26:21.153]  And so that's why this next clip is so imperative.
[01:26:21.153 --> 01:26:22.434]  Guys, let's roll to the next clip now.
[01:26:22.434 --> 01:26:23.995]  This is... again.
[01:26:25.717 --> 01:26:32.163]  The genie is out of the bottle, the cat is out of the bag, the toothpaste is out of the tube, and it cannot be put back in.
[01:26:32.163 --> 01:26:38.529]  This is Judicial Watch on Fox Business saying that the Department of Justice has no choice now but to prosecute Hillary Clinton.
[01:26:38.529 --> 01:26:45.616]  Can the Justice Department now ignore all of these discoveries and not do anything but prosecute this woman?
[01:26:46.303 --> 01:26:47.503]  No, they cannot.
[01:26:47.503 --> 01:26:50.044]  At this point... Bingo!
[01:26:50.044 --> 01:26:52.665]  And that's why Hillary Clinton's house is on fire today.
[01:26:52.665 --> 01:27:00.628]  ...a de novo or a completely fresh look at this entire criminal enterprise being orchestrated by Mrs. Clinton.
[01:27:00.628 --> 01:27:05.530]  Remember, she set up that email server over which all this traffic went back and forth... Sending passwords!
[01:27:05.530 --> 01:27:07.211]  Who am I having sending passwords?
[01:27:07.211 --> 01:27:08.511]  ...before she became Secretary of State.
[01:27:08.511 --> 01:27:10.672]  Classified information on illegal servers!
[01:27:12.001 --> 01:27:14.523]  Uh, you know, with full knowledge, intellect.
[01:27:14.523 --> 01:27:18.305]  Uh, this is a premeditated act on her part.
[01:27:18.305 --> 01:27:20.287]  They started the dossier.
[01:27:20.287 --> 01:27:23.589]  They created the fake dossier.
[01:27:23.589 --> 01:27:27.271]  This is so unreal, it's not even funny.
[01:27:27.271 --> 01:27:35.817]  So let me just stop you then, Chris, because what you were saying is not just... Pause right there.
[01:27:35.817 --> 01:27:37.278]  In the original investigation,
[01:27:38.473 --> 01:27:46.298]  Huma Abedin, Cheryl Mills, and Hillary Clinton all denied knowing that these classified emails were on these servers.
[01:27:46.298 --> 01:27:48.059]  Can you believe that?
[01:27:48.059 --> 01:27:53.142]  Wow, talk about gross incompetence if you believe that.
[01:27:53.142 --> 01:27:54.923]  But so how did it end up there?
[01:27:54.923 --> 01:27:58.845]  And why were you deleting emails and smashing servers if you had no idea?
[01:27:58.845 --> 01:28:00.526]  Again, I mean, now we're looking at perjury.
[01:28:00.526 --> 01:28:01.227]  Here, finish the clip.
[01:28:02.049 --> 01:28:06.692]  ...with individuals like Huma Abedin and others doing stuff they weren't supposed to do.
[01:28:06.692 --> 01:28:11.454]  I don't know how these emails got... I don't know how this video list got on my desk.
[01:28:11.454 --> 01:28:12.795]  How did this get here?
[01:28:12.795 --> 01:28:15.416]  I've never seen this before!
[01:28:15.416 --> 01:28:18.178]  I didn't cue the clips off of this video list.
[01:28:18.178 --> 01:28:19.939]  That's fake news!
[01:28:19.939 --> 01:28:23.020]  ...intentional, although intent is not an element of the crime.
[01:28:23.020 --> 01:28:25.962]  It's just, frankly, more fuel on the fire.
[01:28:25.962 --> 01:28:29.444]  Also realize the Judicial Watch actually got Huma Abedin
[01:28:30.584 --> 01:28:32.785]  Bingo!
[01:28:32.785 --> 01:28:38.066]  And they lied!
[01:28:38.066 --> 01:28:38.866]  And they lied!
[01:28:38.866 --> 01:28:39.826]  There it is right there!
[01:28:39.826 --> 01:28:44.427]  So, alright, we're going to break here.
[01:28:44.427 --> 01:28:45.607]  We're inching closer.
[01:28:45.607 --> 01:28:46.567]  We've got it all.
[01:28:46.567 --> 01:28:54.529]  I mean, this is almost an open and shut case as soon as we have a Justice Department that wants to actually give a real investigation, folks.
[01:28:54.529 --> 01:28:55.409]  Lock.
[01:28:55.409 --> 01:28:56.469]  Her.
[01:28:56.469 --> 01:28:56.549]  Up.
[01:28:57.515 --> 01:28:59.116]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:28:59.116 --> 01:29:01.696]  Visit Infowarslife.com to secure your canister.

[01:29:46.744 --> 01:29:48.187]  That means it's clean.
[01:29:48.187 --> 01:29:49.310]  That means it's pure.
[01:29:49.310 --> 01:29:52.215]  And rest secured, you're fighting the tip of the spear in the Infowar.
[01:29:52.215 --> 01:29:55.001]  That's infowarswives.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[01:30:01.341 --> 01:30:10.486]  We are being hit by toxic weapons in the food and water supply that are making us fat, sick, and stupid.
[01:30:10.486 --> 01:30:11.847]  So what do we do about it?
[01:30:11.847 --> 01:30:15.189]  Well, for starters, don't just sit there and take it.

[01:30:58.295 --> 01:31:05.857]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that
[01:31:07.429 --> 01:31:18.274]  When you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other materiel from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[01:31:18.274 --> 01:31:20.395]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[01:31:20.395 --> 01:31:24.117]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:31:24.117 --> 01:31:34.042]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine, and you cannot beat that for children and adults.
[01:31:34.042 --> 01:31:35.343]  We've got the best mouthwash
[01:31:35.723 --> 01:31:37.564]  Signed by Dr. Jones, that's my dad.

[01:31:39.446 --> 01:31:41.948]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:31:41.948 --> 01:31:51.134]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.

[01:31:58.095 --> 01:32:07.184]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best-tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:32:07.184 --> 01:32:15.592]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:32:15.592 --> 01:32:20.256]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:32:20.456 --> 01:32:27.240]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[01:32:27.240 --> 01:32:34.424]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:32:34.424 --> 01:32:41.448]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:32:41.448 --> 01:32:45.791]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:32:45.911 --> 01:32:49.313]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[01:32:49.313 --> 01:32:55.618]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[01:32:55.618 --> 01:32:57.399]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:32:57.399 --> 01:33:04.124]  The War Room.
[01:33:04.124 --> 01:33:06.605]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:33:16.408 --> 01:33:20.169]  The American way of life is under attack.
[01:33:20.169 --> 01:33:23.770]  This is The War Room with Owen Schroyer.
[01:33:23.770 --> 01:33:29.492]  Watch the live stream right now at infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:33:36.405 --> 01:33:39.047]  This is the InfoWars.com War Room.
[01:33:39.047 --> 01:33:42.209]  I am your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:33:42.209 --> 01:33:47.854]  And in case you haven't noticed, we control the narrative now.
[01:33:47.854 --> 01:33:49.135]  We report the news.
[01:33:49.135 --> 01:33:53.018]  The fake news never sticks because it's just that, fake.
[01:33:53.018 --> 01:33:55.860]  What we report sticks and ages well.
[01:33:57.082 --> 01:34:05.309]  And it's all because of you supporting us at InfowarsStore.com and sharing the links and telling your friends and family about what we're doing here.
[01:34:05.309 --> 01:34:06.950]  And you can see the results, folks.
[01:34:06.950 --> 01:34:07.891]  We are expanding.
[01:34:07.891 --> 01:34:11.093]  We've got 10 hours of live broadcasting now every day.
[01:34:11.093 --> 01:34:14.095]  We do more extended live broadcasts throughout the year.
[01:34:14.095 --> 01:34:15.557]  We're building new studios.
[01:34:15.557 --> 01:34:20.501]  You've already seen some teasers, if you will, of the new studios that we have here.
[01:34:21.401 --> 01:34:33.008]  It's all very exciting stuff and you make all of it possible at InfoWarStore.com and we try to make it easy for you to support us by giving you great specials, great deals, and of course, great products.
[01:34:33.008 --> 01:34:43.793]  So we decided to extend our New Year's specials through the rest of this week, I believe through Sunday night, and that includes free shipping store-wide.
[01:34:43.793 --> 01:34:45.554]  Free shipping store-wide.
[01:34:45.554 --> 01:34:47.916]  Now if you're looking for big savings,
[01:34:49.508 --> 01:34:58.446]  I would say the biggest savings, I mean this is absurd, combined with the free shipping, 50% off all InfoWars Life select storable food products.
[01:34:58.446 --> 01:35:00.550]  So, half off.
[01:35:01.658 --> 01:35:07.123]  The emergency food supply, half off the InfoWars Life select storable food products.
[01:35:07.123 --> 01:35:09.265]  That's already hundreds of dollars of savings.
[01:35:09.265 --> 01:35:10.806]  That's an expensive item.
[01:35:10.806 --> 01:35:12.948]  So you get half off of that.
[01:35:12.948 --> 01:35:21.556]  Then, when you combine that with the free shipping, you can save hundreds, if not thousands of dollars.
[01:35:21.556 --> 01:35:24.699]  Because these are heavier items, obviously, more expensive to ship.
[01:35:25.666 --> 01:35:38.789]  So if you've ever thought about emergency food or you've been on the fence or you haven't financially thought it was a good time, it's as good a time as any right now with the New Year's extended specials.
[01:35:38.789 --> 01:35:44.831]  Free shipping plus 50% off the InfoWars Life Select Storable Food line.
[01:35:44.831 --> 01:35:48.072]  And as you can see here if you're watching us on InfoWars.com slash show,
[01:35:49.022 --> 01:35:56.466]  You've got the one-year supply, the six-month supply, three-month supply, two-week supply, etc., etc.
[01:35:56.466 --> 01:35:59.668]  It's all at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:35:59.668 --> 01:36:03.230]  You know, it is freezing out there.
[01:36:03.230 --> 01:36:12.915]  In fact, they're calling it an Arctic snow bomb up there in the northeast.
[01:36:12.915 --> 01:36:15.757]  So what we have at InfoWarsTore.com, we've got some winter hats.
[01:36:16.587 --> 01:36:20.694]  So, it's wintertime, your ears are cold when you go outside.
[01:36:20.694 --> 01:36:24.100]  Well, we've got winter hats at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:36:24.100 --> 01:36:28.848]  I actually have the Mulan Labe version of the InfoWars winter beanie myself.
[01:36:30.526 --> 01:36:34.969]  Winner hats, ball caps, t-shirts, hoodies.
[01:36:34.969 --> 01:36:38.772]  It's all at InfoWarsStore.com and it all makes this possible.
[01:36:38.772 --> 01:36:41.413]  Thank you so much for your support.
[01:36:41.413 --> 01:36:51.380]  Please launch us to higher levels in 2018 by supporting us at InfoWarsStore.com and telling your friends and family about what we do here.
[01:36:51.380 --> 01:36:59.045]  Real quick, while I've got that on my mind, snow, sleet, freezing rain hit North Florida, so global warming is failing.
[01:36:59.045 --> 01:37:00.346]  I'm actually really upset about that.
[01:37:01.667 --> 01:37:03.448]  I actually like global warming.
[01:37:03.448 --> 01:37:04.609]  I like a warmer planet.
[01:37:04.609 --> 01:37:05.930]  I hate winter.
[01:37:05.930 --> 01:37:09.752]  So, I'm just going to go out and say I'm pro-global warming now.
[01:37:09.752 --> 01:37:10.753]  Hey, there's the winter hat!
[01:37:10.753 --> 01:37:11.914]  Yeah, that's the one I got.
[01:37:11.914 --> 01:37:13.295]  I got the folded one.
[01:37:13.295 --> 01:37:20.099]  There's also the just straight-up beanie one that doesn't fold, but I find that the fold-over one is actually warmer.
[01:37:20.099 --> 01:37:26.404]  And now that global warming has failed us so badly, it's freezing in Austin, Texas, so I have to wear the warm winter hat.
[01:37:28.041 --> 01:37:31.465]  Winter storm heading for southeast.
[01:37:31.465 --> 01:37:33.247]  And northeast, really, is where it's gonna hit.
[01:37:34.707 --> 01:37:38.408]  Bomb Cyclone could form off New England Coast.
[01:37:38.408 --> 01:37:49.933]  Now they're already tracking this and showing this and it looks like this is going to be a massive, massive winter storm hitting New England and it's actually approaching the New England Coast right now.
[01:37:49.933 --> 01:38:02.558]  So hopefully it doesn't get too bad up there, what with the snow and the wind and everything, but they are expecting some serious winter weather to be approaching New England Coast probably tonight
[01:38:03.740 --> 01:38:10.482]  But, uh, we'll just keep track of that, but, uh... Where's my global warming, guys?
[01:38:10.482 --> 01:38:11.362]  Please.
[01:38:11.362 --> 01:38:13.142]  Buy a bigger truck.
[01:38:13.142 --> 01:38:14.323]  Buy a bigger car.
[01:38:14.323 --> 01:38:15.543]  Burn more gasoline.
[01:38:15.543 --> 01:38:17.683]  Spray as many aerosols into the sky.
[01:38:17.683 --> 01:38:21.284]  I mean, this is... I'm so sick of winter.
[01:38:21.284 --> 01:38:22.725]  Come on, Al Gore!
[01:38:22.725 --> 01:38:24.345]  Come on!
[01:38:24.345 --> 01:38:25.045]  Come on, guys!
[01:38:25.045 --> 01:38:27.186]  You said that we were warming the planet.
[01:38:27.186 --> 01:38:28.286]  In fact, you know what?
[01:38:30.143 --> 01:38:33.848]  Here's another challenge, because I'm serious about this.
[01:38:33.848 --> 01:38:36.952]  Tell me how we can warm up the planet.
[01:38:36.952 --> 01:38:38.774]  Can someone actually do a report on that?
[01:38:38.774 --> 01:38:45.022]  There's all this theoretical, made-up science about it that's falling on its face every time from Al Gore and the likes.
[01:38:45.967 --> 01:38:50.150]  Global warming fails, so then they say climate change, what we said originally.
[01:38:50.150 --> 01:38:51.491]  So here we go.
[01:38:51.491 --> 01:38:54.372]  Please, Al Gore, tell me how I can warm up the planet.
[01:38:54.372 --> 01:38:55.873]  Because I will do it.
[01:38:55.873 --> 01:38:57.734]  Just to prove you right, Al.
[01:38:57.734 --> 01:39:00.816]  Al, you've been proven wrong time and time again.
[01:39:00.816 --> 01:39:03.558]  I'm here offering you a chance to be proven right.
[01:39:03.558 --> 01:39:07.401]  Tell us how we can warm up the planet so we can stop these terrible winters.
[01:39:07.401 --> 01:39:07.641]  Okay.
[01:39:09.514 --> 01:39:19.961]  Let's give out the phone number, 888-201-2244, 888-201-2244, 888-201-2244.
[01:39:19.961 --> 01:39:22.643]  We've got all kinds of news you can comment on.
[01:39:22.643 --> 01:39:28.247]  What do you think about the fire at Bill and Hillary's house today?
[01:39:28.247 --> 01:39:37.034]  Is that all just a coincidence, the timing of that with Trump's tweets and the investigation that looks to be turning its way back onto the Clinton camp?
[01:39:37.918 --> 01:39:41.041]  What do you think about this Bannon-Trump feud?
[01:39:41.041 --> 01:39:41.982]  Is it real?
[01:39:41.982 --> 01:39:43.224]  Is it manufactured?
[01:39:43.224 --> 01:39:44.124]  What is the deal?
[01:39:44.124 --> 01:39:46.567]  Why is everyone turning their back on Bannon?
[01:39:46.567 --> 01:39:55.076]  And does the timing of that also correlate with the timing of the Manafort lawsuit against the Mueller probe?
[01:39:55.076 --> 01:39:58.059]  Because it's said in the book that came out
[01:40:00.899 --> 01:40:08.062]  That Bannon is saying Manafort and Kushner were guilty of treason and that there was a meeting that's treasonous, so.
[01:40:08.062 --> 01:40:10.683]  And Bannon has yet to make a comment on this.
[01:40:10.683 --> 01:40:17.746]  The Trumps, well, you've got the letter or the email from Donald Trump, which I'm not positive actually was written from Trump.
[01:40:17.746 --> 01:40:18.246]  I don't know.
[01:40:18.246 --> 01:40:20.607]  We haven't actually heard comments from Trump.
[01:40:20.607 --> 01:40:23.448]  We have had tweets.
[01:40:23.448 --> 01:40:24.929]  And we've had tweets from Don Jr.
[01:40:26.809 --> 01:40:35.955]  But regardless of that whole feud that I'm not really taking much stake in, if I'm just telling you my opinion, I'm curious of the timing of it all.
[01:40:35.955 --> 01:40:45.201]  Because there seems to be some very coincidental timing on some of these events today, but this is kind of what I expected to be happening in January.
[01:40:45.201 --> 01:40:51.685]  Some of these loose ends coming together and some more quote-unquote coincidences
[01:40:53.177 --> 01:40:57.541]  Looking more and more like actual developments.
[01:40:57.541 --> 01:41:06.748]  So we're going to continue to monitor both of those things and we'll take your calls on those things as well in the next segment.
[01:41:06.748 --> 01:41:11.792]  Let's just tackle some news here before we take a break.
[01:41:11.792 --> 01:41:14.254]  We'll just delve into this little short stack I got here.
[01:41:16.132 --> 01:41:21.955]  New York police hunting for masked ISIS supporters who posed in the Big Apple with terror groups logos.
[01:41:21.955 --> 01:41:23.516]  So we reported on this yesterday.
[01:41:23.516 --> 01:41:39.745]  A couple, I guess, ISIS members or sympathizers or whoever these guys were, with their hoods on and their ISIS masks on, taking pictures in front of the New World Trade Center and other buildings in New York.
[01:41:39.745 --> 01:41:41.506]  And so now the police are investigating that.
[01:41:41.506 --> 01:41:43.067]  And I do believe there was an instance
[01:41:44.380 --> 01:42:06.315]  Where you had a similar situation of an ISIS sympathizer taking a picture, I believe it was on the road, where the ISIS terrorist took the truck up on the curbside and started running people over just a few months ago in New York City.
[01:42:06.315 --> 01:42:10.017]  So the police are investigating into that.
[01:42:12.827 --> 01:42:13.468]  Huh.
[01:42:13.468 --> 01:42:15.209]  It's strange how that works.
[01:42:15.209 --> 01:42:19.853]  You know, you got all these people calling for Trump to be censored on Twitter, which I dare Twitter to take Trump off.
[01:42:19.853 --> 01:42:21.014]  I dare them.
[01:42:21.014 --> 01:42:29.381]  You will just empower your enemy to come destroy you, the enemy that you would create yourself by doing so.
[01:42:29.381 --> 01:42:40.070]  But, I mean, it's just strange that nobody calls for these ISIS sympathizers to be censored from Twitter, or all these death threats against the president, against Ajit Pai.
[01:42:41.092 --> 01:42:44.137]  I mean, why is that acceptable?
[01:42:44.137 --> 01:42:45.359]  Oh, because it's liberal.
[01:42:45.359 --> 01:42:47.382]  It's liberal.
[01:42:47.382 --> 01:42:53.812]  If I'm hacking you in the neck with a knife, as long as I'm shouting liberal, you know, you're going to accept it.
[01:42:53.812 --> 01:42:54.393]  It'll be just fine.
[01:42:58.095 --> 01:42:58.875]  I'm so excited.
[01:42:58.875 --> 01:43:08.997]  The new product at m4warslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[01:43:08.997 --> 01:43:14.518]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic, but it doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[01:43:14.518 --> 01:43:17.519]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[01:43:17.519 --> 01:43:26.301]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[01:43:28.390 --> 01:43:36.614]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[01:43:36.614 --> 01:43:47.999]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[01:43:47.999 --> 01:43:50.660]  It is amazing!
[01:43:50.660 --> 01:43:55.642]  Red Pilt, now available at InfoWarsTore.com and your purchase fugs the operation.

[01:45:27.128 --> 01:45:27.368]  Woo!

[01:45:28.408 --> 01:45:37.131]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[01:45:37.131 --> 01:45:46.734]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.

[01:47:04.127 --> 01:47:06.609]  InfoWars.com Forged Slash Shown.
[01:47:32.739 --> 01:47:39.105]  Alright, we are joined by Alex Jones here with breaking analysis of the Bannon-Trump feud.
[01:47:39.105 --> 01:47:40.666]  Alex is on the phone with us now.
[01:47:40.666 --> 01:47:42.768]  Alex, what do you got for us?
[01:47:42.768 --> 01:47:46.712]  Well, Bill, you know, we get hit with big stories and it takes us time to do research.
[01:47:46.712 --> 01:47:49.594]  It takes us time to do analysis.
[01:47:49.594 --> 01:47:55.960]  And I got up about 6 o'clock this morning and at 7 I saw the London Guardian headline
[01:47:57.024 --> 01:48:22.088]  Uh, that Stephen Bannon had said back in November, right after President Trump had been elected, in this supposed book called Fire and Fury, now, that's a newer title, from Trump's statements on North Korea a few months ago, that Stephen Bannon had reportedly made these quotes about, yeah, they should have met with lawyers, they shouldn't have met with these Russians, yeah, it could be treason, they should have called the FBI.
[01:48:22.088 --> 01:48:26.009]  And I immediately thought to myself, well, who is this writer?
[01:48:27.236 --> 01:48:30.957]  Well, we've got some new developments though, but I'm going to sound kind of like the groundwork first.
[01:48:30.957 --> 01:48:34.497]  Someone looked up this Wolf character, and he is as bad as BuzzFeed.
[01:48:34.497 --> 01:48:44.679]  I mean, he is known in liberal journals, conservative journals, as somebody that makes up quotes according to all these witnesses, somebody that is just, just somebody that the facts don't jive.
[01:48:44.679 --> 01:48:51.780]  He's a fiction writer, according to many experts, who masquerades as a newsman.
[01:48:51.780 --> 01:48:55.241]  So that said, he's an establishment liberal political hack.
[01:48:56.050 --> 01:49:04.957]  He's standard but but but he's still he he's one of the one of the main studs when it comes to putting out this info according to all the evidence.
[01:49:04.957 --> 01:49:24.231]  So I think at 11 a.m going on you know five hours six hours into this whatever it was uh because I I think it was published in hours before I even learned about it at 7 a.m the word is like 5 a.m or something but I saw it at 7 a.m because it has check time stamps but I said this wolf guy is such a known
[01:49:25.134 --> 01:49:26.274]  Fraud.
[01:49:26.274 --> 01:49:29.856]  That we can't just get a Republican Civil War going on here.
[01:49:29.856 --> 01:49:30.996]  Right now.
[01:49:30.996 --> 01:49:34.737]  But then I kept saying, before the show even started, I said, but look for Bannon.
[01:49:34.737 --> 01:49:37.018]  So we're all on computers before we start the last show.
[01:49:37.018 --> 01:49:42.180]  Bannon's statement on Trump, Bannon's statement on Wolf's book, Bannon's statement on Byron Curry.
[01:49:42.180 --> 01:49:44.420]  I looked, I looked, the whole time I'm on air, four hours.
[01:49:44.420 --> 01:49:45.561]  Nothing, nothing, nothing.
[01:49:45.561 --> 01:49:48.782]  I just checked before I called in line of the show.
[01:49:48.782 --> 01:49:49.782]  Zero.
[01:49:49.782 --> 01:49:52.763]  Now imagine, you know the White House has a bunch of sources inside.
[01:49:53.656 --> 01:49:54.237]  Uh, Breitbart.
[01:49:54.237 --> 01:49:59.180]  Breitbart was basically, you know, a big part of the final campaign and helped during the early stuff.
[01:49:59.180 --> 01:50:01.502]  So they've got a lot of sources there.
[01:50:01.502 --> 01:50:05.165]  White House could have called me, anybody else, too, to check on sources.
[01:50:05.165 --> 01:50:06.206]  And you know they were doing it.
[01:50:06.206 --> 01:50:07.927]  So they were asking the same question I was asking.
[01:50:07.927 --> 01:50:10.629]  It just dawned on me about 30 minutes ago.
[01:50:10.629 --> 01:50:14.112]  It's all them asking, where's Stephen Bannon's statement on this?
[01:50:14.112 --> 01:50:15.673]  Where's Stephen Bannon's statement on this?
[01:50:17.111 --> 01:50:20.573]  Well, he didn't put a statement out because he wants to respond and be bigger tomorrow.
[01:50:20.573 --> 01:50:22.594]  Well, that tells you just what Trump said in the statement.
[01:50:22.594 --> 01:50:24.375]  Everything is about him.
[01:50:24.375 --> 01:50:38.122]  If you don't care about the country or care about fighting globalism or care about our Make America Great Again agenda, well, then you would sit there and let this come out, maybe wait a couple days till it builds, and then come in with your own big news cycle.
[01:50:38.122 --> 01:50:42.484]  But if it isn't true, you know, if the news reports that I'm a child molester,
[01:50:43.372 --> 01:50:47.257]  Unless I'm out of the country or in a coma, people are going to say, where's Alex Jones?
[01:50:47.257 --> 01:50:50.340]  Hour 1, hour 2, hour 3, hour 4, hour 5, hour 6.
[01:50:50.340 --> 01:50:56.808]  I mean, it's like almost 5 o'clock central right now, 6 o'clock eastern.
[01:50:57.766 --> 01:50:58.546]  And so let's go back.
[01:50:58.546 --> 01:51:00.247]  I saw it at 7am.
[01:51:00.247 --> 01:51:02.568]  So that's 3 hours, 2 hours, 5 hours.
[01:51:02.568 --> 01:51:04.269]  That's 10 hours.
[01:51:04.269 --> 01:51:07.530]  So we're 10 hours later from when I saw it.
[01:51:07.530 --> 01:51:11.191]  I've been so busy, I haven't checked the time stamp on the Guardian.
[01:51:11.191 --> 01:51:14.713]  So we're 10 hours later here, and we've not heard from Ben.
[01:51:14.713 --> 01:51:20.415]  And well, 5 hours, 6 hours into Ben not responding, and you know the guy reached out to him.
[01:51:20.415 --> 01:51:22.096]  I got his phone number.
[01:51:22.096 --> 01:51:23.176]  I just leave the guy alone.
[01:51:25.380 --> 01:51:28.061]  All these hours into this, we don't hear a response.
[01:51:28.061 --> 01:51:33.865]  That tells you, I think, everything you need to know to maybe side with the President.
[01:51:33.865 --> 01:51:34.546]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:51:34.546 --> 01:51:36.387]  The whole thing's a front, too.
[01:51:36.387 --> 01:51:41.731]  Because that meeting was about orphans, and the lady said she had dirt about the Clintons in Russia.
[01:51:41.731 --> 01:51:44.913]  Exposing Russian control of our government isn't treason, it's the opposite.
[01:51:45.453 --> 01:51:53.262]  Whether you're talking to an Eskimo, somebody from Mexico, somebody from Germany, somebody from Japan, a black guy, a white guy, it doesn't matter.
[01:51:53.262 --> 01:51:57.987]  So the whole thing is a reboot of Russiagate because it's beyond being on its knees.
[01:51:57.987 --> 01:52:00.350]  The wheels have come off and I don't want to fight with Breitbart.
[01:52:00.350 --> 01:52:02.212]  It's a one-way street.
[01:52:02.212 --> 01:52:05.796]  Breitbart literally maybe gives us one link for every 500 we send them.
[01:52:07.195 --> 01:52:19.523]  It's just an example of how this total one-way deal, because there's so much good stuff at Breitbart, we promote them, we send them like 20% of their traffic, that's fine, because I just want to beat the globalists.
[01:52:19.523 --> 01:52:30.571]  But if it shows you now what Trump's saying, it's all about Bannon, it's all about him, it's all about him being in control, and this is so damaging, driving a wedge in the Republican Party right now.
[01:52:32.881 --> 01:52:37.865]  That's what I heard about six months ago about Bannon trying to do behind the scenes, not to reform it, but to take it over.
[01:52:37.865 --> 01:52:40.607]  Then why hasn't he responded?
[01:52:40.607 --> 01:52:43.470]  The big thing is, why hasn't Bannon responded?
[01:52:43.470 --> 01:52:45.231]  Why hasn't Bannon responded?
[01:52:45.231 --> 01:52:46.472]  Or is he in a coma?
[01:52:46.472 --> 01:52:47.793]  Was he in a car wreck?
[01:52:47.793 --> 01:52:51.056]  Or maybe I missed it, but I've had the crew at the office and myself looking.
[01:52:51.056 --> 01:52:52.917]  You've got like six people running your show right now.
[01:52:52.917 --> 01:52:58.242]  Can we get an answer in the next hour we've got left in the war room of why ten hours at least into this?
[01:52:59.378 --> 01:53:00.280]  Okay.
[01:53:00.280 --> 01:53:07.254]  Why haven't we heard yet about a statement from him, the number one story in the United States?
[01:53:07.254 --> 01:53:08.155]  Owen Troyer, what do you think?
[01:53:08.155 --> 01:53:10.199]  Well, I think that's great, Alex.
[01:53:10.199 --> 01:53:10.420]  I mean...
[01:53:11.519 --> 01:53:12.720]  That's a good idea.
[01:53:12.720 --> 01:53:17.885]  If we apply public pressure to Bannon to try to clear the air on this, I mean, that's the headline.
[01:53:17.885 --> 01:53:23.791]  Alex Jones challenges Steve Bannon to make a statement because the silence is deafening right now.
[01:53:23.791 --> 01:53:31.719]  And, you know, here's the only thing about it to me that I think kind of gets blown out of proportion when we talk about driving a wedge in between the Republican Party
[01:53:32.279 --> 01:53:35.825]  I mean, I don't really know what Steve Bannon is doing behind closed doors.
[01:53:35.825 --> 01:53:45.742]  The candidates that are going to be running in the 2018 midterms, some of them have spoken to Bannon and they're not even getting a clear picture of exactly what Bannon has in mind, so that's a little strange to me, but to me...
[01:53:47.168 --> 01:53:48.729]  I have no problem with Steve Bannon.
[01:53:48.729 --> 01:53:56.837]  I think I probably like a lot of Steve Bannon's policies, but Alex, I think he's just, he's a non-entity, and if he wasn't before, now he certainly is.
[01:53:56.837 --> 01:53:57.958]  No, I totally agree.
[01:53:57.958 --> 01:54:01.321]  With the loss of Moore, that was his waterloo.
[01:54:01.321 --> 01:54:01.961]  It moves on.
[01:54:01.961 --> 01:54:05.825]  This just smells of desperation, because it suddenly comes out now.
[01:54:05.825 --> 01:54:12.331]  It didn't come out before, showing collusion with this Democratic writer, who's been holding on to this interview since November.
[01:54:13.300 --> 01:54:15.761]  Of last, not of last year, of the year before.
[01:54:15.761 --> 01:54:17.582]  We're talking 13 months ago.
[01:54:17.582 --> 01:54:28.869]  So that's what I'm saying is, you know, it could have just been a train wreck or a problem, but we're talking 10 hours in on my clock or 8, 9, 10 hours, depending on how you look at it.
[01:54:28.869 --> 01:54:30.369]  It was published before that, obviously.
[01:54:30.369 --> 01:54:31.730]  In fact, can we get a time cut on that?
[01:54:31.730 --> 01:54:33.211]  I'm asking folks to check that.
[01:54:33.211 --> 01:54:34.692]  The point is, this came out early this morning.
[01:54:34.692 --> 01:54:35.812]  I saw it at 7 a.m.
[01:54:35.812 --> 01:54:40.335]  It already was all over the news and a bunch of publications that this had come out.
[01:54:41.295 --> 01:54:43.916]  You'd think within an hour you'd hear from Bannon.
[01:54:43.916 --> 01:54:45.657]  Two hours, three hours, four hours.
[01:54:45.657 --> 01:54:47.078]  So again, I don't want to wedge.
[01:54:47.078 --> 01:54:48.459]  I don't like civil wars.
[01:54:48.459 --> 01:54:49.539]  I don't like infighting.
[01:54:49.539 --> 01:54:51.781]  I don't like getting off on the drama.
[01:54:51.781 --> 01:54:54.582]  I'm like almost religious, as you know, about not infighting.
[01:54:54.582 --> 01:54:58.084]  Sometimes I go too far and a lot of people run me in the ground just because I won't engage in it.
[01:54:58.084 --> 01:54:59.085]  I'm fighting globalists.
[01:54:59.085 --> 01:55:00.005]  I'm fighting communists.
[01:55:00.005 --> 01:55:01.266]  I'm fighting socialists.
[01:55:01.266 --> 01:55:03.487]  I'm fighting pedophiles.
[01:55:03.487 --> 01:55:05.768]  I'm fighting vampires.
[01:55:05.768 --> 01:55:06.829]  Psychic vampires.
[01:55:06.829 --> 01:55:07.069]  Scum.
[01:55:08.049 --> 01:55:16.856]  But I'm telling you, the fact that he hasn't responded, the silence is deafening, and I am challenging Steve Bannon to release a statement.
[01:55:16.856 --> 01:55:26.664]  I mean, I agree with what you're saying that he's not that important right now, and that's what leans towards the fact that he went along with this to try to stay relevant.
[01:55:26.664 --> 01:55:37.212]  He may become like Beck, who became this apologist against conservatives and the leftist media, and I think he may be going the path of somebody he didn't like previously, who was, of course,
[01:55:38.155 --> 01:55:39.336]  Our good buddy Glenn Beck.
[01:55:39.336 --> 01:55:49.661]  And maybe we'll hear a statement tomorrow, here's some reason for this, but just the waiting, allowing this cycle to play out, to hurt the president, to hurt our movement and all this, even if he comes out later.
[01:55:49.661 --> 01:55:58.246]  I think that's why the president went both barrels five hours or more after this happened, was because the president was waiting, waiting, you know, reaching out.
[01:55:58.246 --> 01:55:59.587]  Did you really do this?
[01:55:59.587 --> 01:56:01.288]  Did you really say this?
[01:56:01.288 --> 01:56:02.428]  And we got nothing.
[01:56:02.428 --> 01:56:03.349]  What do you think, Owen Troyer?
[01:56:04.147 --> 01:56:12.432]  Yeah, I think you're 100% right, and I think that this was a spat if this is, you know, if it really is bad as it looks here as far as just a spat between the two.
[01:56:12.432 --> 01:56:18.936]  I think that this was a foreign policy spat that Bannon and Trump never really saw eye to eye.
[01:56:18.936 --> 01:56:28.561]  I think specifically it had to do with Israel, and apparently it got so intense between the two, Bannon had to fracture himself away from Trump because of the foreign policy disagreements.
[01:56:28.561 --> 01:56:30.843]  But Alex, before we go here, we've got a minute left.
[01:56:31.343 --> 01:56:33.284]  What do you think about the timing of this?
[01:56:33.284 --> 01:56:43.512]  The same day that this becomes a news story is the same day that Paul Manafort is launching his lawsuit against the Mueller probe.
[01:56:43.512 --> 01:56:44.592]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:56:44.592 --> 01:56:46.954]  Moles inside the system coordinated this.
[01:56:46.954 --> 01:56:48.655]  They've had this interview for months.
[01:56:48.655 --> 01:56:56.801]  This is 100% their next salvo in the new year, and it's got fingerprints all over it that sourpuss, sour grapes,
[01:56:57.623 --> 01:56:58.564]  Loser.
[01:56:58.564 --> 01:57:06.788]  I'm not saying he's a loser until he did this, but if he did, this loser, piss in the Cheerios, move, take your ball and go home situation.
[01:57:06.788 --> 01:57:13.792]  The timing, not commenting, all of it just absolutely makes me sick to my stomach, Ellen.
[01:57:13.792 --> 01:57:15.573]  And it's up to the listeners and viewers.
[01:57:15.573 --> 01:57:17.134]  Paul Watson's got a poll up on his tweet.
[01:57:17.874 --> 01:57:19.976]  Who will folks vote for in the next election?
[01:57:19.976 --> 01:57:22.678]  Will it be Steve Bannon or will it be President Trump?
[01:57:22.678 --> 01:57:24.459]  80% are for President Trump.
[01:57:24.459 --> 01:57:26.801]  People can vote on that at Prison Planet on Twitter.
[01:57:26.801 --> 01:57:30.043]  You guys can have the results towards the end of the hour, the next hour coming up.
[01:57:30.043 --> 01:57:32.024]  Everybody, we're under censorship and attack.
[01:57:32.024 --> 01:57:37.829]  Please spread the live links on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and all the radio and TV stations because you're the reason we're reaching people.
[01:57:37.829 --> 01:57:38.509]  I love you all.
[01:57:38.509 --> 01:57:40.110]  Great job, Alan Shorter and the crew.
[01:57:40.110 --> 01:57:41.171]  Back to the live transmission.
[01:57:47.358 --> 01:57:53.342]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by Infowars Life.
[01:57:53.342 --> 01:57:57.485]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[01:57:57.485 --> 01:58:03.749]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[01:58:05.530 --> 01:58:12.674]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.
[01:58:12.674 --> 01:58:18.537]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.
[01:58:18.537 --> 01:58:27.241]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms, including
[01:58:28.507 --> 01:58:28.827]  I think so.
[01:58:48.550 --> 01:58:54.313]  2017 has been a earth-shaking year.
[01:58:54.313 --> 01:58:57.575]  And 2018, guaranteed, is even gonna be wilder.
[01:58:57.575 --> 01:59:02.378]  In fact, my good friend Stefan Molyneux said it's gonna be like the Battle of the Gods, Ragnarok.
[01:59:02.378 --> 01:59:04.399]  So get ready, ladies and gentlemen.

[02:00:14.602 --> 02:00:18.525]  Give me liberty or give me death.
[02:00:18.525 --> 02:00:21.868]  The fight for the future is now.
[02:00:21.868 --> 02:00:26.512]  This is The War Room with Owen Troyer.
[02:00:26.512 --> 02:00:32.277]  Watch the live stream right now at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:00:41.497 --> 02:00:58.266]  Well, whatever Steve Bannon did to get on the bad side of the Trumps, he's doing himself no favors by sitting in silence as this story continues to build upon itself.
[02:00:58.266 --> 02:01:07.451]  And again, you look at what Steve Bannon is saying, allegedly in this book, pretty much saying that
[02:01:08.837 --> 02:01:22.260]  Kushner and Manafort were laundering money and committing treason by colluding with Russia the same day that gets published, allegedly from the mouth of Steve Bannon.
[02:01:22.260 --> 02:01:30.941]  We say allegedly because Michael Wolff is known to fabricate quotes, but Bannon remains silent so we don't know and that's not a good sign.
[02:01:30.941 --> 02:01:33.782]  Manafort pushes back legally
[02:01:34.773 --> 02:01:45.665]  Against Mueller's probe, the same day Bannon, an alleged statement from Bannon gets published in a book, saying that they're guilty.
[02:01:48.706 --> 02:01:53.269]  Now, if that's true, again, this is what it comes down to for me, too.
[02:01:53.269 --> 02:01:56.031]  Steve Bannon doesn't dictate any policy.
[02:01:56.031 --> 02:01:58.032]  Steve Bannon is just a guy.
[02:01:58.032 --> 02:01:59.733]  He's not in office.
[02:01:59.733 --> 02:02:02.695]  And I'm not even thinking, I don't even think he runs Breitbart.
[02:02:02.695 --> 02:02:08.899]  I think he is still affiliated, but I don't think he's actually running the show over there.
[02:02:08.899 --> 02:02:11.461]  So why did he pick and choose this battle?
[02:02:13.895 --> 02:02:25.181]  And what we're really seeing now is if Steve Bannon actually thought that he could best Trump or somehow take Trump's base from him, he was sadly mistaken.
[02:02:25.181 --> 02:02:27.283]  Paul Joseph Watson has the Twitter poll up now.
[02:02:27.283 --> 02:02:30.284]  In fact, guys, if you could pull that up.
[02:02:30.284 --> 02:02:31.925]  Steve Bannon says the Don Jr.
[02:02:31.925 --> 02:02:34.447]  meeting with a Russian lawyer was treasonous.
[02:02:34.447 --> 02:02:37.008]  Bannon vs. Trump 2020, who would you vote for?
[02:02:37.008 --> 02:02:38.349]  Go ahead and select Trump there.
[02:02:38.349 --> 02:02:40.070]  That's who I would vote for.
[02:02:40.070 --> 02:02:41.871]  It's not even a question, in fact.
[02:02:42.788 --> 02:02:50.514]  So we select Trump, there's been almost 25,000 votes there, and Trump gets 62%.
[02:02:50.514 --> 02:02:53.717]  Only 7% say they would vote for Bannon.
[02:02:53.717 --> 02:02:59.341]  And those are honestly probably detractors that just went into Paul Joseph's poll to vote there.
[02:02:59.341 --> 02:03:03.985]  I don't know any Trump supporters that would take Bannon over Trump.
[02:03:03.985 --> 02:03:07.948]  So, why is Bannon silent?
[02:03:09.306 --> 02:03:20.129]  What was he thinking and what is he thinking today as he's now been totally excoriated, what it looks like, from Trump's inner circle?
[02:03:20.129 --> 02:03:34.992]  And then what will come of the Manafort lawsuit pushing back against Mueller in the fake Russian probe that is nothing more than a witch hunt as a quote-unquote insurance policy that was
[02:03:38.655 --> 02:03:51.506]  Exposed in the text messages from the FBI agent Peter Stroke, who was the same man involved in investigating Hillary Clinton, Huma Abedin, and Cheryl Mills.
[02:03:51.506 --> 02:03:54.909]  So that is going to be fun to watch.
[02:03:57.731 --> 02:04:02.853]  And if you do think Bannon is running Breitbart, Breitbart publishes this story.
[02:04:02.853 --> 02:04:08.415]  Bannon says Mueller investigation will target Kushner, Manafort's greasy money laundering deals.
[02:04:08.415 --> 02:04:14.077]  So if you think Bannon's running Breitbart, there's your double down.
[02:04:14.077 --> 02:04:24.460]  There's your lack of denial and still lack of statement directly from Bannon himself.
[02:04:24.460 --> 02:04:26.861]  So is Bannon now just in the trash heap?
[02:04:28.419 --> 02:04:32.562]  Or is there another ripple to come of this story?
[02:04:32.562 --> 02:04:34.783]  Real quick, we'll take your calls on the other side.
[02:04:34.783 --> 02:04:39.726]  Doug Jones gets sworn in today, as well as Tina Smiths from Minnesota.
[02:04:39.726 --> 02:04:44.870]  So 51-49 is now the Republican advantage in the Senate.
[02:04:44.870 --> 02:04:49.913]  So what happens to Roy Moore's lawsuit about the election fraud in Alabama?
[02:04:49.913 --> 02:04:50.593]  Not sure.
[02:04:50.593 --> 02:04:52.715]  Doug Jones, sworn in today.
[02:04:56.474 --> 02:05:00.855]  Fuel your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[02:05:00.855 --> 02:05:08.958]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestion process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[02:05:08.958 --> 02:05:14.240]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[02:05:14.240 --> 02:05:16.781]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[02:05:16.781 --> 02:05:21.002]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[02:05:21.002 --> 02:05:23.423]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[02:05:24.127 --> 02:05:31.352]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[02:05:31.352 --> 02:05:38.538]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[02:05:39.418 --> 02:05:46.606]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[02:05:46.606 --> 02:05:48.068]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[02:05:48.068 --> 02:05:50.711]  Use Carnivore by InfoWars Life.
[02:05:50.711 --> 02:05:54.195]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com and secure your bottle now.
[02:05:54.195 --> 02:05:55.917]  That's InfoWarsLife.com
[02:06:10.771 --> 02:06:12.512]  We're about to go to the phone lines here.
[02:06:12.512 --> 02:06:20.336]  You can call in 888-201-2244, 888-201-2244, Steve Bannon, the Clinton's house on fire, global warming, whatever you want to talk about today.
[02:06:20.336 --> 02:06:23.157]  Real quick before we go to the phone lines, I want to take a second
[02:06:40.856 --> 02:06:44.710]  To say happy birthday to Seth Rich.
[02:06:46.013 --> 02:06:52.597]  Seth Rich would have been 28 years old today had he not been murdered July 10, 2016.
[02:06:52.597 --> 02:07:10.088]  It is widely believed that Seth Rich was a WikiLeaks source and a Guccifer 2.0 source to expose the corruption inside the Democrat Party, specifically when it comes to rigging elections and covering up crimes.
[02:07:10.088 --> 02:07:11.329]  Seth Rich murdered
[02:07:12.313 --> 02:07:19.818]  On January, or excuse me, July 10, 2016, today would have been his 28th birthday.
[02:07:19.818 --> 02:07:36.450]  And that's an interesting little matzo ball that still sits out there in this crazy world we currently live in, where some of these investigations are now spinning back and being aimed at the Clinton campaign, the Barack Obama administration.
[02:07:37.728 --> 02:07:39.449]  Hey, what's going on, Owen?
[02:07:55.055 --> 02:07:56.476]  Oh man, two quick things.
[02:07:56.476 --> 02:08:00.499]  One, why can't I listen to your show on the InfoWars Live app?
[02:08:00.499 --> 02:08:03.081]  It always just recycles over to Alex's.
[02:08:03.081 --> 02:08:04.902]  Huge fan of y'all's, by the way.
[02:08:04.902 --> 02:08:06.523]  What's up, Alex?
[02:08:06.523 --> 02:08:09.545]  Two, I have an awesome t-shirt idea for y'all.
[02:08:09.545 --> 02:08:12.927]  It says, if you're still a Trump hater, let me have your extra paper.
[02:08:12.927 --> 02:08:17.410]  You can do the Trump T, like with your t-shirt there, with the hat on, or with the hair on.
[02:08:17.410 --> 02:08:19.712]  I think that'd be awesome.
[02:08:19.712 --> 02:08:24.035]  Yeah, yeah, if you don't like your tax cut, I'll take that extra, I'll take that money from you.
[02:08:24.497 --> 02:08:25.777]  Right, exactly.
[02:08:25.777 --> 02:08:31.799]  I could use it, but I wanted to talk on the weather change, man.
[02:08:31.799 --> 02:08:50.524]  So I live down here in Houston, and I'm sure you're familiar with chemtrails, but to me it seems like whenever Trump took office and did his climate executive order, what was that, back in March, it seemed like some of the chemtrails, at least the majority of the chemtrails, have seemed to go away.
[02:08:51.264 --> 02:09:07.617]  Now, if that's into HAARP and cloud seeding and all that fun stuff, I think that the climate is actually acting the way that it was supposed to before we started injecting it with all this aluminum and the chemtrails and all that stuff.
[02:09:07.617 --> 02:09:10.479]  I just wanted to see what your thoughts on that would be.
[02:09:10.479 --> 02:09:12.460]  That's actually an interesting angle.
[02:09:12.460 --> 02:09:16.684]  You're not the first person that I've heard notice that and even report on that.
[02:09:16.684 --> 02:09:19.586]  There's other people that have said that they've noticed the same thing.
[02:09:21.340 --> 02:09:29.803]  You know, Geoengineering Watch, their website would probably be a great source to actually track that information to know if it's accurate or not.
[02:09:29.803 --> 02:09:36.605]  I don't want to comment on the amount of chemtrails before and after Trump because I just don't have enough information aggregated to say so.
[02:09:38.206 --> 02:09:45.328]  I mean, I guess it's fair to say, I mean, it is fair to say that the weather, I mean, has been different since he became president.
[02:09:45.328 --> 02:09:52.391]  I mean, you had the massive hurricane season, and you have this freak winter season, so maybe there's something to that.
[02:09:52.391 --> 02:09:56.332]  I just don't have the information to report on that.
[02:09:56.332 --> 02:09:57.012]  Well, I got you, man.
[02:09:57.012 --> 02:09:58.953]  Well, I appreciate you taking my call, man.
[02:09:58.953 --> 02:09:59.473]  Y'all take it easy.
[02:10:00.242 --> 02:10:01.543]  Alright David, thank you so much.
[02:10:01.543 --> 02:10:06.786]  Let's go to Victor, calling in from Florida, where they don't normally get snow, but they are today.
[02:10:06.786 --> 02:10:07.447]  What's up, Victor?
[02:10:07.447 --> 02:10:14.512]  Hey, well I'm not here in South Florida, but up north I guess in Dallas, but by Tallahassee they did I guess.
[02:10:14.512 --> 02:10:17.674]  Well I saw it on the local news and I'm glad that you just said that because
[02:10:18.394 --> 02:10:24.222]  I saw some commercials for the local news that they try to make themselves, they kind of separate themselves.
[02:10:24.222 --> 02:10:27.607]  Now this is CBS, NBC, local news.
[02:10:27.607 --> 02:10:34.977]  They try to kind of create a wedge between them and the mainstream like NBC and MSNBC and CNN.
[02:10:35.738 --> 02:10:36.719]  You're talking about what happened?
[02:10:52.438 --> 02:10:53.979]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:10:53.979 --> 02:10:54.819]  I'm not going to read it.
[02:10:54.819 --> 02:10:55.580]  I'm not.
[02:10:55.580 --> 02:10:59.321]  I don't care to read that garbage.
[02:10:59.321 --> 02:11:12.708]  But I was thinking if anyone has read it and anyone that is like one of those analysts on the CIA NSA that for every 10 words, they pick one word and then kind of puzzle things together.
[02:11:12.708 --> 02:11:13.068]  I don't know.
[02:11:13.068 --> 02:11:19.971]  I may sound like a big conspiracy theorist right now, but maybe she wrote it to kind of give everyone like that is
[02:11:29.769 --> 02:11:31.250]  Well, here's the thing.
[02:11:31.250 --> 02:11:38.215]  I don't think, A, that she wrote it, so I'm not really sure if she even knows what happened.
[02:11:38.215 --> 02:11:42.278]  I mean, you know, she doesn't even know what's happening, so I don't know about that.
[02:11:42.278 --> 02:11:44.340]  As far as them having to stay on message,
[02:11:45.393 --> 02:11:48.554]  I think that they pretty much would already know what to do with that.
[02:11:48.554 --> 02:11:50.934]  They wouldn't necessarily need the book.
[02:11:50.934 --> 02:12:00.136]  But I guess if they're worried about some sort of communication issue, perhaps they think they can put out little messages in the book to try to keep all of their minions on the same page.
[02:12:00.136 --> 02:12:06.798]  But another reason why she writes that book is because she was so embarrassed by the lost... Well, quote-unquote, writes the book.
[02:12:06.798 --> 02:12:07.558]  I mean, let's be clear.
[02:12:07.558 --> 02:12:08.738]  I don't think Hillary wrote a word.
[02:12:09.864 --> 02:12:15.128]  She actually had to cover her own skin and make excuses for why she lost.
[02:12:15.128 --> 02:12:18.170]  She was the heavy favorite, according to the fake news.
[02:12:18.170 --> 02:12:21.493]  She had all the big donors.
[02:12:21.493 --> 02:12:22.954]  She let all the elite down.
[02:12:22.954 --> 02:12:24.435]  She was the elitist candidate.
[02:12:24.435 --> 02:12:26.196]  She was the big donor candidate.
[02:12:26.196 --> 02:12:28.098]  She let them all down.
[02:12:28.098 --> 02:12:30.159]  So her writing that book was kind of her like...
[02:12:31.440 --> 02:12:32.501]  Don't blame me!
[02:12:32.501 --> 02:12:33.741]  Look at everything that happened!
[02:12:33.741 --> 02:12:35.723]  It wasn't my fault, big donors!
[02:12:35.723 --> 02:12:39.425]  It wasn't my fault, 1.5 billion dollar presidential campaign!
[02:12:39.425 --> 02:12:40.345]  Look at what happened!
[02:12:40.345 --> 02:12:41.306]  It wasn't my fault!
[02:12:43.095 --> 02:12:43.956]  Yeah, that's true.
[02:12:43.956 --> 02:12:47.337]  I can definitely see that.
[02:12:47.337 --> 02:12:47.977]  Who knows?
[02:12:47.977 --> 02:12:49.838]  I'm just glad she's not president.
[02:12:49.838 --> 02:12:52.899]  I was born outside of this country.
[02:12:52.899 --> 02:12:55.540]  I'm actually a legal immigrant to the United States.
[02:12:55.540 --> 02:12:58.621]  My whole entire family came here legally.
[02:12:58.621 --> 02:13:02.143]  Me and my brother, we both support Donald Trump.
[02:13:02.143 --> 02:13:05.384]  My parents, they're kind of getting around to it, to be honest.
[02:13:06.252 --> 02:13:19.481]  You know, as most Latinos, you kind of are brought up in this kind of thing where, you know, Republicans are only for the rich and, you know, just the typical stuff that the Democrats feed the minority.
[02:13:19.481 --> 02:13:25.425]  But you're saying with the results that they've seen from President Trump so far, they're kind of coming around to President Trump?
[02:13:26.241 --> 02:13:32.903]  Yeah, they definitely see that, you know, all the stuff is being distorted and they listen to that.
[02:13:32.903 --> 02:13:36.424]  And I think that's about to be a huge story for 2018.
[02:13:36.424 --> 02:13:48.248]  A lot of these people that have fallen for the fake news talking point start to realize that they were inaccurate, they weren't right, and now they're actually seeing the impact of a President Trump on their daily lives.
[02:13:48.248 --> 02:13:50.589]  Maybe it's safer in their community now.
[02:13:50.589 --> 02:13:54.710]  Maybe they got a pay raise, a bonus, less taxes being paid.
[02:13:55.450 --> 02:14:01.912]  People are going to start to see the results of President Trump manifest in their own lives, and if they hated Trump before, they might come around.
[02:14:01.912 --> 02:14:04.233]  Sounds like that might be happening in Victor's household.
[02:14:04.233 --> 02:14:05.514]  Thank you so much for the call, Victor.
[02:14:05.514 --> 02:14:07.955]  Let's go to John in Tennessee.
[02:14:07.955 --> 02:14:08.635]  Go ahead, John.
[02:14:08.635 --> 02:14:13.076]  Hey, I was going in for two things.
[02:14:13.076 --> 02:14:20.139]  One, real quick, I think you, Rob, and Roger need to get together and find y'all's five favorite ties.
[02:14:20.808 --> 02:14:23.531]  Okay, so basically you're saying InfoWars needs a line of ties?
[02:14:23.531 --> 02:14:24.292]  I like that idea.
[02:14:24.292 --> 02:14:25.053]  I am a big fan of that.
[02:14:39.827 --> 02:14:44.748]  So maybe there's someone listening right now that maybe put something like that into the works.
[02:14:44.748 --> 02:14:46.428]  Hey, I do have this new story.
[02:14:46.428 --> 02:14:48.089]  Manufacturing in the U.S.
[02:14:48.089 --> 02:14:52.010]  just accelerated to its best year since 2004.
[02:14:52.010 --> 02:14:53.910]  So there's another Trump nugget there.
[02:14:53.910 --> 02:14:55.190]  Manufacturing is back up.
[02:14:55.190 --> 02:14:56.470]  That's what Trump said he would do.
[02:14:56.470 --> 02:14:57.891]  Another promise fulfilled.
[02:14:57.891 --> 02:15:01.251]  So hey, maybe InfoWars starts manufacturing ties.
[02:15:01.251 --> 02:15:02.052]  I don't know.
[02:15:02.052 --> 02:15:06.132]  Our store continues to expand every day.
[02:15:06.132 --> 02:15:06.993]  Exactly.
[02:15:06.993 --> 02:15:07.993]  Win, win, win.
[02:15:07.993 --> 02:15:08.713]  I ain't tired of it yet.
[02:15:09.702 --> 02:15:12.365]  I'm not tired of winning.
[02:15:12.365 --> 02:15:16.009]  No, and it seems like whoever tries to go against Trump loses.
[02:15:16.009 --> 02:15:19.172]  In fact, has anyone won against Trump yet?
[02:15:19.172 --> 02:15:20.714]  Bannon is the latest to fall.
[02:15:20.714 --> 02:15:23.076]  Has anyone won against Trump?
[02:15:23.076 --> 02:15:25.298]  Is there anyone who's actually beaten Trump?
[02:15:25.298 --> 02:15:25.338]  No.
[02:15:27.970 --> 02:15:40.357]  You know, some good food for thought, I think, is what if Roy Moore would have won, and the situation that Bannon's in today would have been a totally different opposition, you know?
[02:15:40.357 --> 02:15:47.981]  You know, I'm not sure, but the thing that frustrates me about this is that that election was... Man, there was so much voter fraud in that election, it's not even funny.
[02:15:47.981 --> 02:15:51.643]  If you look at Roy Moore's lawsuit, I mean, they've got the evidence.
[02:15:51.643 --> 02:15:52.604]  This isn't even a debate.
[02:15:52.604 --> 02:15:54.785]  You see that in any other election, it's a red flag.
[02:15:56.767 --> 02:15:58.388]  Matt in Ohio, you're on the air.
[02:15:58.388 --> 02:15:59.349]  Another Matt, go ahead.
[02:15:59.349 --> 02:16:13.940]  Yeah, hey, listen, I just wanted to say real quick, I'm a longtime listener of InfoWars, and I just wanted to say that the t-shirts that you guys are offering are absolutely fantastic, and that really is a great way to deal with this battle in the InfoWars.
[02:16:13.940 --> 02:16:21.566]  It might seem like a simple thing, but particularly these slogan t-shirts that you guys got up right now are absolutely amazing.
[02:16:21.566 --> 02:16:21.886]  Well, thank you
[02:16:22.046 --> 02:16:26.967]  My favorite new one is the Don't Tread On Me, but instead it says Won't Tread On Me.
[02:16:26.967 --> 02:16:29.928]  And it's a big Dayglo snake, Gadsden snake.
[02:16:29.928 --> 02:16:33.189]  And then it's got the American flag, Infowars.com on the right arm.
[02:16:33.189 --> 02:16:39.451]  I mean, that's a great way just to meet like-minded people and spread the word and also exercise free speech.
[02:16:39.451 --> 02:16:41.872]  And the newest one is Trigger Warning T-shirt.
[02:16:42.612 --> 02:16:49.465]  Trigger warning t-shirt which is the symbol of a trigger with a yield sign and then InfoWars.com on the back.
[02:16:49.465 --> 02:16:53.993]  That is the new shirt of the month available exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com
[02:16:55.867 --> 02:16:57.308]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[02:16:57.308 --> 02:16:58.629]  It took you over a year to do it.
[02:16:58.629 --> 02:16:59.830]  Why is this so good?
[02:16:59.830 --> 02:17:05.113]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[02:17:05.113 --> 02:17:18.682]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[02:17:18.682 --> 02:17:20.023]  Right now with all the refugees,
[02:17:20.783 --> 02:17:22.444]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[02:17:22.444 --> 02:17:25.026]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[02:17:25.026 --> 02:17:26.327]  These are all parasites.
[02:17:26.327 --> 02:17:27.427]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[02:17:27.427 --> 02:17:28.768]  There's so many things that are in it.
[02:17:28.768 --> 02:17:33.271]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[02:17:33.271 --> 02:17:36.433]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:17:36.553 --> 02:17:39.595]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:17:39.595 --> 02:17:40.656]  It just came back in yesterday.
[02:17:40.656 --> 02:17:42.578]  LivingDefense, InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:17:42.578 --> 02:17:43.619]  And folks, you can't lose.
[02:17:43.619 --> 02:17:46.301]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[02:17:46.301 --> 02:17:48.242]  And you support the broadcast.
[02:17:48.242 --> 02:17:49.583]  InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:17:49.583 --> 02:17:51.825]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[02:17:51.825 --> 02:17:53.787]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[02:17:56.189 --> 02:17:59.614]  Introducing CellForce by InfoWars Life.
[02:17:59.614 --> 02:18:03.579]  CellForce focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[02:18:03.579 --> 02:18:06.923]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[02:18:06.923 --> 02:18:09.467]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[02:18:09.467 --> 02:18:13.813]  CellForce helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[02:18:14.173 --> 02:18:23.536]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul, because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[02:18:23.536 --> 02:18:30.699]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[02:18:31.719 --> 02:18:36.784]  The antioxidants found in CellForce are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[02:18:36.784 --> 02:18:44.431]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[02:18:44.431 --> 02:18:49.336]  Boost, protect, and adapt with CellForce from InfoWars Life.
[02:18:49.336 --> 02:18:52.259]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:18:56.127 --> 02:19:06.462]  We have developed with the top firms in the United States powerful 50 billion live organism probiotic flora life that is so critical.
[02:19:07.773 --> 02:19:10.415]  It's having a healthy gut and a healthy life.
[02:19:10.415 --> 02:19:13.738]  And it has changed my life and so many other people's lives.
[02:19:13.738 --> 02:19:23.425]  The other part is a compound like MycoZx that has all these key ingredients of organic herbs and other systems that are known to break down this garbage in the body.
[02:19:23.425 --> 02:19:33.213]  That's why, as we go through Christmas and now into the new year, we're extending the free shipping and 50% off on all our best-selling items while supplies last.
[02:19:33.213 --> 02:19:35.354]  You can also get the two products together
[02:19:36.320 --> 02:19:40.342]  And get them at 50% off when you combo them.
[02:19:40.342 --> 02:19:42.543]  So popular, sold out for more than six months.
[02:19:42.543 --> 02:19:48.366]  Now back in stock for a limited time at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLive.com, or by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[02:19:48.366 --> 02:19:49.146]  The War Room.
[02:19:49.146 --> 02:19:49.947]  InfoWars.com, Forbes slash show.
[02:20:26.561 --> 02:20:34.424]  It's pretty amazing, I think, what InfoWars was able to do in 2017, live, ten hours a day.
[02:20:34.424 --> 02:20:44.207]  You get the real news with David Knight every morning, Alex Jones Show for four hours every day, and then the War Room here with myself and Roger Stone to close it all out.
[02:20:44.207 --> 02:20:52.270]  Ten hours of live broadcast so that we can bring you all the news as it breaks, in real time, all the different angles, all the different guests.
[02:20:53.170 --> 02:20:59.855]  And it's really just incredible now, 10 hours a day you can tune in to InfoWars and get the hardest hitting news.
[02:20:59.855 --> 02:21:03.257]  And it's all possible with your support.
[02:21:03.257 --> 02:21:07.740]  And not only are we expanding our live broadcast, but we expand...
[02:21:08.721 --> 02:21:11.963]  Our store, it seems like daily as well.
[02:21:11.963 --> 02:21:13.543]  So look at Alpha Power.
[02:21:13.543 --> 02:21:15.264]  That's one of our newest products.
[02:21:15.264 --> 02:21:19.306]  50% off right now at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:21:19.306 --> 02:21:20.967]  Alpha Power, 50% off.
[02:21:20.967 --> 02:21:24.248]  I am about to start taking Alpha Power myself.
[02:21:24.248 --> 02:21:30.411]  I'm actually finishing off my final bottle of Anthroplex and then I'm going to make the switch to Alpha Power.
[02:21:32.123 --> 02:21:36.445]  Both great products, but that's a new product and it's 50% off.
[02:21:36.445 --> 02:21:47.169]  So we bring it to you at the introductory rate of 50% off because we have confidence that when you try our products, you're going to become a repeat customer.
[02:21:47.169 --> 02:21:50.610]  That's why we have such huge discounts right now.
[02:21:50.610 --> 02:21:54.632]  Some of the other new products we have, the Real Red Pill, that's 50% off.
[02:21:54.632 --> 02:21:56.033]  Cell Force is also 50% off.
[02:21:56.033 --> 02:21:56.673]  So those are three
[02:22:00.149 --> 02:22:00.389]  Of course!
[02:22:18.982 --> 02:22:21.524]  Maybe you're not into supplements and nutraceuticals.
[02:22:21.524 --> 02:22:23.805]  Maybe you don't need another t-shirt.
[02:22:23.805 --> 02:22:29.088]  Well, we have household items at InfowarsStore.com, like toothpaste.
[02:22:29.088 --> 02:22:32.350]  You're going to buy a bottle of toothpaste this year, probably two.
[02:22:32.350 --> 02:22:36.213]  Maybe you've got a big family, maybe three, four, five bottles of toothpaste.
[02:22:36.213 --> 02:22:41.116]  Well, why not go to InfowarsStore.com, support the good guys, and get the best toothpaste?
[02:22:41.116 --> 02:22:42.176]  It's a win-win-win.
[02:22:43.417 --> 02:22:46.138]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[02:22:46.138 --> 02:22:53.041]  In fact, the entire line of Super Blue products is 50% off right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:22:53.041 --> 02:22:57.763]  There is the highly rated Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[02:22:57.763 --> 02:23:01.645]  I'm telling you, I gave this as a stocking stuffer to many of my family and friends.
[02:23:01.645 --> 02:23:03.026]  They are hooked.
[02:23:03.026 --> 02:23:06.707]  They'll never get another toothpaste again, I'm telling you.
[02:23:06.707 --> 02:23:08.288]  Super Blue Toothpaste.
[02:23:09.221 --> 02:23:12.524]  Let's go back out to the phone lines where we go to Alina in New York City.
[02:23:12.524 --> 02:23:14.486]  She's out there in the public school system.
[02:23:14.486 --> 02:23:14.986]  Go ahead Alina.
[02:23:30.640 --> 02:23:32.480]  Oh, and I'm sorry to call back so soon.
[02:23:32.480 --> 02:23:38.602]  I want to just point out two positive things that happened today, mostly with the kindergarten and first graders.
[02:23:38.602 --> 02:23:45.144]  We took a vote on who wanted to do a YouTube search about learning about our country, USA.
[02:23:45.144 --> 02:23:50.925]  The vote was basically unanimous, so thanks to you, we're connecting there.
[02:23:51.885 --> 02:23:59.287]  And we're going to get the Thump books and I'm going to share them around to try to get President Trump into our public school in West Harlem.
[02:23:59.287 --> 02:24:05.609]  Now are you talking about the book that Alex was talking about today, The Thump?
[02:24:05.609 --> 02:24:06.730]  The Trump Rabbit?
[02:24:06.730 --> 02:24:07.230]  Oh, okay.
[02:24:07.990 --> 02:24:11.113]  So I'm going to go right now and order those.
[02:24:11.113 --> 02:24:14.356]  And that's the positiveness we had because of you.
[02:24:14.356 --> 02:24:15.437]  I wish you could see it.
[02:24:15.437 --> 02:24:16.998]  It's really fun.
[02:24:16.998 --> 02:24:29.609]  You know, that's so awesome, too, because I remember yesterday we talked about the idea where you could expose their double standard by having, you know, liberal books, the anti-conservative books in there, you know, that they would accept.
[02:24:30.349 --> 02:24:32.872]  And then you try to bring in a Trump book and they would reject it.
[02:24:32.872 --> 02:24:34.473]  Yeah, there's the book right there.
[02:24:34.473 --> 02:24:38.456]  Limited Edition Thump Book and Poster Combo at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:24:38.456 --> 02:24:41.980]  Yes, I'm going there right now.
[02:24:41.980 --> 02:24:42.820]  Well, that's so great.
[02:24:42.820 --> 02:24:44.161]  Thank you so much for your support.
[02:24:44.161 --> 02:24:47.184]  Thank you so much for caring about those children's future as well.
[02:24:47.184 --> 02:24:48.505]  And thank you for you, Owen.
[02:24:48.505 --> 02:24:49.006]  God bless.
[02:24:49.704 --> 02:24:50.184]  Hey Owen!
[02:24:50.184 --> 02:24:51.024]  Happy Holidays to you!
[02:24:51.024 --> 02:24:51.884]  I am so happy that
[02:25:18.962 --> 02:25:22.724]  Y'all are on the radio.
[02:25:22.724 --> 02:25:32.668]  I'm concerned that President Trump seems like he's in the dark all the time.
[02:25:32.668 --> 02:25:37.470]  Well I'll tell you what, it's interesting that you, I actually want to talk about that because it's interesting that you bring that up.
[02:25:38.442 --> 02:25:51.529]  Well, one, we use the talk radio format because it allows us to reach out and hear from the audience, and it's teleprompter-free, talking point-free, you know, free thought, critical thinking, critical analysis.
[02:25:51.529 --> 02:26:01.134]  So that's why we go with the talk radio format, which I think is the best and that people are more gravitating towards instead of the canned type of news you see on television.
[02:26:01.134 --> 02:26:02.695]  We don't have a teleprompter here.
[02:26:02.695 --> 02:26:07.358]  Secondly, what you're talking about with the president being shut out is actually very key.
[02:26:08.138 --> 02:26:15.765]  Now, President Trump had multiple dinners at Mar-a-Lago over the holiday season.
[02:26:15.765 --> 02:26:22.891]  And let's just say I happen to be privy about some of what went down at those dinners.
[02:26:22.891 --> 02:26:26.153]  Let's use one example, Michael Savage.
[02:26:26.153 --> 02:26:32.199]  Michael Savage had Donald Trump on his radio show multiple times before the presidential election.
[02:26:33.482 --> 02:26:38.866]  And then even had a direct pipeline to President Trump after he was inaugurated.
[02:26:38.866 --> 02:26:46.651]  And even attended, I believe it was an Easter, I think it was an Easter meal at Mar-a-Lago with President Trump.
[02:26:46.651 --> 02:26:52.075]  And then seemingly, after that dinner, Savage, totally out of touch with Trump.
[02:26:52.075 --> 02:26:52.996]  He doesn't understand.
[02:26:52.996 --> 02:26:54.557]  He complains about it on his radio show.
[02:26:54.557 --> 02:26:56.238]  He's not sure what's going on.
[02:26:56.238 --> 02:26:58.660]  Why isn't Trump listening?
[02:26:58.660 --> 02:27:01.682]  Well, Michael Savage gets invited to
[02:27:03.007 --> 02:27:23.922]  I actually think two of the dinners at Mar-a-Lago, yes, two dinners at Mar-a-Lago over the holiday season, talks to Trump and finds out that indeed someone within Trump's team, I suppose, is keeping certain personalities or people from getting their message to President Trump.
[02:27:23.922 --> 02:27:26.904]  And when he found out about that, he was not happy about it.
[02:27:28.041 --> 02:27:36.747]  Now having said that, just because people are trying to stop things from getting to Trump, they still get to him.
[02:27:36.747 --> 02:27:43.332]  Whether it be his own efforts, or because he's so busy, let's say a Don Jr.
[02:27:43.332 --> 02:27:48.795]  telling him something, or a Hope Hicks or a Stephen Miller floating something across his desk.
[02:27:50.322 --> 02:27:55.045]  He's still able to get some of the intel, but your intuition is right.
[02:27:55.045 --> 02:28:00.849]  There is a filter that people are trying to stop Trump from hearing from some of his biggest supporters.
[02:28:00.849 --> 02:28:01.710]  Absolutely.
[02:28:01.710 --> 02:28:06.894]  You remember how long that Joe Arpaio was languishing out there, too.
[02:28:06.894 --> 02:28:07.754]  Perfect example.
[02:28:07.754 --> 02:28:08.475]  Perfect example.
[02:28:08.475 --> 02:28:09.455]  So what happens?
[02:28:09.455 --> 02:28:11.517]  See, that's the perfect example, and Alex was talking about that today.
[02:28:12.438 --> 02:28:14.299]  Trump doesn't get the information.
[02:28:14.299 --> 02:28:16.139]  For some reason, it's getting blocked.
[02:28:16.139 --> 02:28:17.640]  So we keep hammering it.
[02:28:17.640 --> 02:28:19.360]  Alex Jones keeps filing reports.
[02:28:19.360 --> 02:28:20.700]  Alex Jones keeps reporting on it.
[02:28:20.700 --> 02:28:24.622]  Alex Jones puts out a special report saying, please, President Trump, you need to know about this.
[02:28:24.622 --> 02:28:26.322]  Reaches out with his direct line.
[02:28:26.322 --> 02:28:27.703]  And then what happens?
[02:28:27.703 --> 02:28:31.884]  Trump pardons Sheriff Joe.
[02:28:31.884 --> 02:28:35.565]  And I'll tell you what, and I would say expect something perhaps
[02:28:38.180 --> 02:28:43.652]  Let's just say Trump knows who his friends are, and he will be loyal to those that are loyal to him.
[02:28:43.652 --> 02:28:44.634]  I'll just leave it to you like that.
[02:28:44.634 --> 02:28:48.121]  Larry, if you got something else, we'll hold Larry over, because I was talking over him.
[02:28:48.121 --> 02:28:48.882]  This is The War Room.
[02:28:48.882 --> 02:28:49.484]  We'll be right back.
[02:28:55.404 --> 02:29:01.406]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by Infowars Life.

[02:29:05.547 --> 02:29:13.590]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.

[02:33:02.232 --> 02:33:04.714]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:33:07.406 --> 02:33:10.889]  This is the return of the Republic.
[02:33:10.889 --> 02:33:24.119]  And this is The War Room with Owen Schroyer at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:33:24.119 --> 02:33:24.599]  Alright, here we go.
[02:33:24.599 --> 02:33:25.660]  We got two segments left.
[02:33:25.660 --> 02:33:28.943]  We're holding Larry over because I was talking over him in the last segment.
[02:33:28.943 --> 02:33:32.105]  So we're going to let Larry finish his thoughts over there in Mississippi.
[02:33:32.105 --> 02:33:32.706]  Go ahead, Larry.
[02:33:33.311 --> 02:33:40.113]  Hey Owen, how about those cowboys out west that are losing the grazing land?
[02:33:40.113 --> 02:33:53.878]  Turns out that one of our congressmen that just retired is going to try to put that together with the Chinese for, what do you call it, the windmill?
[02:33:53.878 --> 02:33:58.179]  You know what, I'm not sure exactly what you're talking about, but I'll kind of go off on a jag.
[02:33:58.179 --> 02:33:59.660]  There's people that think
[02:34:01.385 --> 02:34:13.154]  These fires in California may have been started by, let's just say, a potential land buyer, like a Chinese government, trying to sweep up a bunch of property at a very low price.
[02:34:13.154 --> 02:34:20.279]  I don't doubt that.
[02:34:20.279 --> 02:34:24.062]  I think a lot of those fires in California were definitely started by someone, yes.
[02:34:24.062 --> 02:34:25.443]  Arson, terrorism, yeah.
[02:34:27.110 --> 02:34:33.714]  When the cowboys were out there, they had grazing property for over a hundred years.
[02:34:33.714 --> 02:34:36.035]  Nobody had a problem with it.
[02:34:36.035 --> 02:34:38.797]  And then snipers from the government come in.
[02:34:38.797 --> 02:34:39.097]  Yes.
[02:34:39.097 --> 02:34:44.180]  Well, who was that congressman from Las Vegas?
[02:34:44.180 --> 02:34:45.761]  You're talking about Harry Reid?
[02:34:57.250 --> 02:34:58.815]  Yeah.
[02:34:58.815 --> 02:35:03.710]  Yeah, Harry Reid was trying to do dirty deals with the Chinese and he was using his son as a conduit.
[02:35:03.710 --> 02:35:03.911]  Yeah.
[02:35:04.795 --> 02:35:06.757]  Yeah, so that stuff is definitely a potential.
[02:35:06.757 --> 02:35:09.018]  You've got Chinese agents that have infiltrated the U.S.
[02:35:09.018 --> 02:35:09.359]  government.
[02:35:09.359 --> 02:35:10.460]  Hillary Clinton, probably one of them.
[02:35:10.460 --> 02:35:14.423]  That's why she just has these wide open servers with all these classified documents on it.
[02:35:14.423 --> 02:35:20.688]  You know, you leave a nice little document in there, you tell them it's there, they go hack it and steal it, and then you get a little donation to your foundation.
[02:35:20.688 --> 02:35:21.628]  That's how the Clintons work.
[02:35:21.628 --> 02:35:23.810]  Larry, thank you so much for the call.
[02:35:23.810 --> 02:35:26.772]  Let's go to John calling in from Houston now.
[02:35:26.772 --> 02:35:29.214]  Go ahead, John.
[02:35:29.214 --> 02:35:30.695]  Hey, Owen.
[02:35:30.695 --> 02:35:32.097]  How's it going?
[02:35:32.097 --> 02:35:32.557]  It's going good.
[02:35:33.847 --> 02:35:48.016]  I just wanted to see if you had noticed the revolution in Iran bearing any similarities to the revolution in Syria and the revolution in Ukraine, these color revolutions.
[02:35:48.016 --> 02:35:50.618]  Well, I think they're all tied together.
[02:35:50.618 --> 02:35:53.079]  I don't know about similarities.
[02:35:53.079 --> 02:35:55.341]  I don't know if I could say I noticed similarities.
[02:35:55.341 --> 02:35:56.422]  I mean, this seems to be
[02:35:57.717 --> 02:36:08.403]  At least for now, organic people on the streets uprising, whereas in Saudi Arabia, there was a kind of a royalty purge, if you will.
[02:36:08.403 --> 02:36:10.183]  But I do think they're connected.
[02:36:10.183 --> 02:36:22.450]  Well, there's this group, the People's Nujahideen of Iran, called on Washington, Brussels, and the Security Council to intervene.
[02:36:22.450 --> 02:36:24.651]  They're a CIA-supported group.
[02:36:24.651 --> 02:36:26.612]  So, I mean, you know, it's straight-up just terrorism.
[02:36:29.072 --> 02:36:32.115]  From what side are you saying?
[02:36:32.115 --> 02:36:41.602]  The people revolting against the government, like the main group, it's literally called the people... So are you saying you're pro-Iranian regime right now?
[02:36:41.602 --> 02:36:44.545]  No, anti-Iranian are Sunni extremists.
[02:36:44.545 --> 02:36:49.208]  So they're using Sunni extremists to spearhead the revolution, that's what I'm saying.
[02:36:49.208 --> 02:36:49.789]  So it's like...
[02:36:51.395 --> 02:36:56.819]  Uh, I don't think anyone's actually going to intervene on their behalf, but they, uh, they're asking for help.
[02:36:56.819 --> 02:37:04.905]  So that's kind of similar to what happened in Ukraine when they were, uh, they toppled the, uh, existing government and then asked for help from the West and it pretty much never happened.
[02:37:07.099 --> 02:37:21.865]  Well, it's definitely going to be something to monitor, and Steve Pachenek was on the Alex Jones Show yesterday saying he wants there to be a regime change, which gets a little help from, you know, Western people and, you know, perhaps proxy armies.
[02:37:21.865 --> 02:37:26.307]  I'm not sure if that's actually going on, but I don't know.
[02:37:26.307 --> 02:37:26.407]  To me...
[02:37:28.453 --> 02:37:44.214]  I haven't really wanted to get too much into it because I feel like maybe the people of Iran can settle this for themselves and I'm gonna wait and see kind of the results of all this before I make a judgment about what's actually happening there but you know I mean this story came out of Egypt
[02:37:45.458 --> 02:37:51.304]  Female pop star arrested in Egypt over sexually suggestive music video.
[02:37:51.304 --> 02:37:55.227]  So this is just what you get in these Muslim states.
[02:37:55.227 --> 02:37:57.249]  Women have no rights.
[02:37:57.249 --> 02:37:58.771]  Women have to cover their faces.
[02:37:58.771 --> 02:38:00.652]  Women have to go around with men.
[02:38:00.652 --> 02:38:07.399]  It's the crazy radical... Yeah, so now Saudi Arabia and Iran all of a sudden have tried to liberalize.
[02:38:07.399 --> 02:38:09.441]  I think in Iran they're going to do away with headscarves.
[02:38:11.022 --> 02:38:19.310]  So they're in some kind of PR, you know, battle now to all of a sudden to appear liberal, but I mean, I'm sure no one's buying it, you know what I mean?
[02:38:19.310 --> 02:38:22.814]  Well, it's weird that they don't get any coverage from the liberals.
[02:38:22.814 --> 02:38:25.957]  You know, it's funny that you say that, because the liberals completely ignore this.
[02:38:25.957 --> 02:38:30.741]  I mean, they're the ones for women's rights, and they're the ones ignoring these protests.
[02:38:30.741 --> 02:38:32.183]  Yeah, that's interesting.
[02:38:32.183 --> 02:38:32.963]  No coverage at all.
[02:38:32.963 --> 02:38:33.964]  I'm not sure what to make of that.
[02:38:33.964 --> 02:38:34.245]  Nothing.
[02:38:34.941 --> 02:38:35.942]  Nothing from liberal media.
[02:38:35.942 --> 02:38:36.563]  Yeah.
[02:38:36.563 --> 02:38:37.724]  That's quite odd.
[02:38:37.724 --> 02:38:42.869]  Yeah, I haven't heard about Linda Sarsour going to Iran to join in the protest.
[02:38:42.869 --> 02:38:46.192]  I haven't heard of Linda Sarsour taking the Women's March to Iran ever.
[02:38:46.192 --> 02:38:47.733]  Funny how that works.
[02:38:47.733 --> 02:38:48.994]  That's not a good sign, yeah.
[02:38:48.994 --> 02:38:51.757]  That's not something... That's weird.
[02:38:51.757 --> 02:38:55.380]  Well, that to me says that maybe perhaps it is organic, but it really doesn't matter.
[02:38:55.380 --> 02:38:58.443]  Linda Sarsour isn't putting foot on foreign soil with her message anyway.
[02:38:58.443 --> 02:38:58.984]  She's a fraud.
[02:38:59.898 --> 02:39:00.818]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:39:00.818 --> 02:39:01.899]  That's right.
[02:39:01.899 --> 02:39:02.339]  Absolutely.
[02:39:02.339 --> 02:39:08.602]  Yeah, the biggest thing to me about the Iranian thing would be the silence from the liberal media.
[02:39:08.602 --> 02:39:16.246]  As far as what's happening there, I'm going to wait and kind of see where some of the leaves fall on the ground before I go and make a judgment there, John.
[02:39:16.246 --> 02:39:17.367]  Thank you so much for calling in.
[02:39:17.367 --> 02:39:19.748]  Let's cram in Eric in Florida.
[02:39:19.748 --> 02:39:21.909]  Go ahead, Eric.
[02:39:21.909 --> 02:39:22.529]  Hey, Owen.
[02:39:22.529 --> 02:39:23.630]  How are you doing?
[02:39:23.630 --> 02:39:23.970]  Doing good.
[02:39:26.886 --> 02:39:27.686]  Pretty good.
[02:39:27.686 --> 02:39:28.787]  Pretty good so far in 2018.
[02:39:28.787 --> 02:39:32.388]  I think Hillary Clinton's freaking out.
[02:39:32.388 --> 02:39:34.989]  Absolutely.
[02:39:34.989 --> 02:39:38.070]  So that brings me to where I'm going.
[02:39:38.070 --> 02:39:49.453]  Do you think maybe they had a bunch of paperwork, 8 1⁄2 by 11, or they had storage facilities over all the years before everything became computerized?
[02:39:49.453 --> 02:39:50.894]  And, you know, they put out fires.
[02:39:52.873 --> 02:39:59.297]  But maybe they didn't know how to put out a real fire that really burned you, your skin and everything.
[02:39:59.297 --> 02:40:02.899]  Maybe they didn't have a chimney sweep.
[02:40:02.899 --> 02:40:05.821]  And they had a chimney fire.
[02:40:05.821 --> 02:40:07.062]  Well, who knows?
[02:40:07.062 --> 02:40:09.223]  Who knows what happened with the fire?
[02:40:09.223 --> 02:40:10.925]  Who knows if we'll ever really know?
[02:40:10.925 --> 02:40:14.267]  But I mean, my goodness, if it isn't a coincidence,
[02:40:15.370 --> 02:40:29.262]  As we see all these developments moving closer and closer to Hillary Clinton finally reaching justice for all her crimes, a fire is reported at their home.
[02:40:29.262 --> 02:40:31.384]  Company, take all the paperwork away.
[02:40:33.444 --> 02:40:40.569]  Yeah, I mean this is the same people that got caught on camera trying to remove voting records from scenes illegally.
[02:40:40.569 --> 02:40:49.136]  These are the same people that have been caught smashing cell phones, smashing servers, not turning over servers, deleting emails.
[02:40:49.136 --> 02:40:54.780]  So it would just go right along with everything else they do if they were trying to burn evidence in the Clinton House today.
[02:40:54.780 --> 02:41:00.665]  They didn't either put out a real physical fire or they had a chimney fire.
[02:41:00.665 --> 02:41:02.166]  I mean, it's all open.
[02:41:03.307 --> 02:41:04.428]  Well, who knows?
[02:41:04.428 --> 02:41:07.771]  We'll have to find out if or even if we will find out.
[02:41:07.771 --> 02:41:14.316]  I mean, I don't know if the Chappaqua police or fire is going to make a statement about if they found anything there.
[02:41:14.316 --> 02:41:18.299]  But I will say this, if Hillary Clinton is actually wearing
[02:41:19.039 --> 02:41:26.545]  An ankle bracelet, as people are rumoring, as part of whatever investigation is going on, then they'll investigate what she was burning.
[02:41:26.545 --> 02:41:27.685]  I promise you that.
[02:41:27.685 --> 02:41:35.631]  Then it becomes a serious investigation, and now she might even be looking at some other crime for trying to cover up that, if that's actually the story.
[02:41:35.631 --> 02:41:36.612]  Alright, Eric, thank you for the call.
[02:41:36.612 --> 02:41:40.194]  Lori, you are going to close out this segment from Ohio.
[02:41:40.194 --> 02:41:40.555]  Go ahead.
[02:41:41.297 --> 02:41:42.878]  Hi, Owen, how are you?
[02:41:42.878 --> 02:41:43.138]  Good.
[02:41:43.138 --> 02:41:43.959]  Happy New Year to you.
[02:41:43.959 --> 02:41:45.720]  Thank you, you too.
[02:41:45.720 --> 02:41:46.481]  A couple things.
[02:41:46.481 --> 02:41:50.063]  The BrainForce Plus, I've been getting the BrainForce for a while.
[02:41:50.063 --> 02:41:51.304]  The Plus is excellent.
[02:41:51.304 --> 02:41:54.767]  I just want your listeners to know that it is awesome.
[02:41:54.767 --> 02:41:55.547]  It works really well.
[02:41:55.547 --> 02:42:00.411]  The other thing I want to touch on is the California fires.
[02:42:00.411 --> 02:42:10.218]  When I was looking up the train derailment, I saw another feed off of there, and there was an article about how that area is rich in natural gas and oil.
[02:42:12.736 --> 02:42:20.281]  Oh, so you're saying someone might want to come try to buy up that nutrient-rich land like the Chinese that are doing that all over the South Asian seas?
[02:42:20.281 --> 02:42:20.601]  Could be.
[02:42:21.826 --> 02:42:23.107]  Possibility.
[02:42:23.107 --> 02:42:31.770]  And the other thing I wanted to mention too is how ridiculous are they going to get about, I mean, first of all, hey, damn lefties, why don't you get your minds out of the gutter?
[02:42:31.770 --> 02:42:38.613]  Maybe his comment about the nuclear button had nothing to do with nothing but nuclear arsenal and the power to do something.
[02:42:38.613 --> 02:42:40.814]  Well, it obviously did.
[02:42:40.814 --> 02:42:41.755]  No, but see, that's the thing.
[02:42:42.575 --> 02:42:44.938]  They don't understand Trump's nuance.
[02:42:44.938 --> 02:42:46.200]  They don't understand the nuance.
[02:42:46.200 --> 02:42:52.208]  They don't understand what Trump does on his Twitter because they just live in this complete hatred of Trump.
[02:42:52.208 --> 02:42:53.489]  Alright, final segment on the other side.
[02:42:53.489 --> 02:42:55.412]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:42:55.412 --> 02:42:57.314]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:42:57.314 --> 02:42:57.635]  Go ahead.
[02:42:58.545 --> 02:43:00.467]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[02:43:00.467 --> 02:43:10.676]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[02:43:10.676 --> 02:43:14.339]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks.
[02:43:14.819 --> 02:43:15.139]  Absolutely.
[02:43:37.575 --> 02:43:50.496]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[02:43:55.427 --> 02:44:01.310]  2017 has been a earth-shaking year.
[02:44:01.310 --> 02:44:04.451]  And 2018, guaranteed, is even gonna be wilder.
[02:44:04.451 --> 02:44:09.274]  In fact, my good friend, Stefan Molyneux, said it's gonna be like the Battle of the Gods, Ragnarok.
[02:44:09.274 --> 02:44:11.295]  So get ready, ladies and gentlemen.

[02:45:05.563 --> 02:45:13.972]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:45:13.972 --> 02:45:18.637]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:45:18.837 --> 02:45:25.621]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[02:45:25.621 --> 02:45:32.805]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:45:32.805 --> 02:45:39.829]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.

[02:47:01.998 --> 02:47:20.569]  Okay, yesterday we had it in the news about North Korea setting to launch
[02:47:27.643 --> 02:47:28.463]  ICBMs.
[02:47:28.463 --> 02:47:30.904]  In fact, record-setting ICBMs.
[02:47:30.904 --> 02:47:38.246]  This story just comes down from Kelly Morales at MSM or The Week.
[02:47:38.246 --> 02:47:40.007]  I don't know if they just republished this.
[02:47:40.007 --> 02:47:40.627]  I just got this.
[02:47:40.627 --> 02:47:42.648]  I'm reading it from my phone here.
[02:47:42.648 --> 02:47:43.808]  Headline.
[02:47:43.808 --> 02:47:49.350]  North Korea accidentally hit one of its own cities with a missile.
[02:47:51.923 --> 02:48:03.031]  So they're testing missiles and apparently they launched a missile and it hit the city of Tokchon, which has a population of more than 200,000 people.
[02:48:03.031 --> 02:48:12.098]  No reports of deaths have been confirmed, but why would we expect the North Korean regime to accurately report on that if this story is true?
[02:48:12.098 --> 02:48:21.125]  And if this story is true, you want to talk about egg on the face of Kim Jong-un right in the midst of all this coverage of President Trump's tweets.
[02:48:22.952 --> 02:48:30.779]  See, I mean, I'm telling you, President Trump has this stuff so timed up, it's almost unbelievable.
[02:48:30.779 --> 02:48:41.688]  Trump tweets out a troll tweet about a nuclear button in response to Kim Jong-un, and then this story breaks the next day, North Korea accidentally hits one of its own cities with a missile.
[02:48:41.688 --> 02:48:47.493]  When Trump is making fun of how ineffective their missiles are, the next day, the report gets filed, they hit their own city.
[02:48:48.686 --> 02:48:48.926]  Wow.
[02:48:48.926 --> 02:48:58.371]  All right, I am in the middle of a news blitz here in the final segment, so I need to commit and clear my desk of all of this news.
[02:48:58.371 --> 02:49:00.992]  Dirty, bloody, and lots of sex.
[02:49:00.992 --> 02:49:07.035]  How Dennis Villanueva's Cleopatra will rip up Hollywood's rule books.
[02:49:07.035 --> 02:49:14.579]  So they're going to do a remake of the classic movie Cleopatra, and they're bragging about how it's going to be dirty and bloody and sexual.
[02:49:15.599 --> 02:49:32.217]  I'm sorry, again, why is Hollywood virtue signaling to the rest of America about equal rights for women and treating women right and being an upstanding moral individual, when it is the most sick, corrupt, vile... I mean...
[02:49:33.238 --> 02:49:33.919]  I don't even care.
[02:49:33.919 --> 02:49:37.302]  I'm not complaining about the smut that comes out of Hollywood.
[02:49:37.302 --> 02:49:53.159]  I'm just saying, why do they sit here, brag about the most recent movie they're going to come out with that's going to be so vile and disgusting and sexual, and then out of the other side of their mouth they're going to say, oh, but we are moral, upstanding individuals that don't want to objectify or treat anyone wrong.
[02:49:53.559 --> 02:49:55.100]  By the way, we're about to make this video.
[02:49:55.100 --> 02:49:58.421]  It's gonna be sick and sexy and gory and yes, that's what we do here.
[02:49:58.421 --> 02:50:04.043]  Oh, but be a good person and you know, don't be so, you know, desensitized by media.
[02:50:04.043 --> 02:50:09.125]  Yeah, now we're gonna show you a hundred people dying in the latest film and there's gonna be blood and sex.
[02:50:09.125 --> 02:50:13.507]  And yeah, you guys really should not be desensitized by our media.
[02:50:13.507 --> 02:50:15.528]  So that's interesting, coming out of Hollywood.
[02:50:15.528 --> 02:50:21.470]  Harvey Weinstein urged Clinton campaign to silence Sanders' Black Lives Matter message.
[02:50:21.470 --> 02:50:22.831]  So this is another example.
[02:50:23.942 --> 02:50:36.850]  Not just of Hillary Clinton being really close to Harvey Weinstein, a sexually, uh, a guy who's been accused of multiple accounts of sexual assault and rape and is clearly a bully, just based on the leaked audio tape we heard.
[02:50:36.850 --> 02:50:51.859]  And, you know, here he is showing that he has influence on the Hillary Clinton campaign saying, we need to bring this issue back to Sandy Hook instead of Black Lives Matter because Sanders has the advantage there.
[02:50:52.432 --> 02:50:54.072]  Hillary Clinton didn't matter, bro.
[02:50:54.072 --> 02:50:56.093]  She had the whole thing rigged anyway.
[02:50:56.093 --> 02:50:59.474]  Two Harvey Weinstein police investigations sent to L.A.
[02:50:59.474 --> 02:51:01.194]  District Attorney.
[02:51:01.194 --> 02:51:02.334]  My, my.
[02:51:02.334 --> 02:51:11.237]  Two investigations into Harvey Weinstein on accusations of sexual assault have been filed with the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office and are under review.
[02:51:11.237 --> 02:51:11.297]  Hmm.
[02:51:13.814 --> 02:51:24.620]  There's the Clinton-Obama friend, big donor Harvey Weinstein, and the sexual assault allegations are now at the L.A.
[02:51:24.620 --> 02:51:25.060]  D.A.'
[02:51:25.020 --> 02:51:26.001]  's office.
[02:51:26.001 --> 02:51:28.402]  WikiLeaks tweets this out yesterday,
[02:51:32.990 --> 02:51:35.332]  Excuse me, let me re-read this.
[02:51:35.332 --> 02:51:44.459]  Top Clinton aide cornered women for sex and was protected by campaign manager Robbie Mook according to accusations in January 2015 email.
[02:51:44.459 --> 02:51:45.680]  Hashtag me too.
[02:51:45.680 --> 02:51:47.181]  They released the email.
[02:51:47.181 --> 02:51:53.346]  It alleges Marlon Marshall, a former campaign advisor to Hillary Clinton,
[02:51:54.448 --> 02:52:04.150]  Was accused of cornering women, making them uncomfortable, suggesting sex, and it was reported to MOOC, who then buried the issue.
[02:52:04.150 --> 02:52:08.671]  Well, that would be the exact type of thing that Hillary Clinton would do, so does it surprise you that Robbie MOOC would do that?
[02:52:08.671 --> 02:52:12.272]  I mean, these are the same people that hang out with Harvey Weinstein.
[02:52:12.272 --> 02:52:17.353]  And then they have Chelsea Clinton sends Happy New Year tweet to the Church of Satan!
[02:52:18.325 --> 02:52:28.380]  Not just was she having a Happy New Year's tweet with the Church of Satan, they were actually having a conversation and then even Chrissy Teigen got involved in that.
[02:52:28.380 --> 02:52:31.444]  This is the same Chrissy Teigen who, for whatever reason,
[02:52:32.529 --> 02:52:35.312]  Is tweeting weird stuff about pedophilia?
[02:52:35.312 --> 02:52:36.914]  I'm just gonna leave it right there.
[02:52:36.914 --> 02:52:42.061]  I don't understand how these people think they can make jokes about raping children and pedophilia on Twitter.
[02:52:42.061 --> 02:52:43.923]  Or are they not joking?
[02:52:43.923 --> 02:52:44.884]  Very weird.
[02:52:44.884 --> 02:52:48.729]  Anyway, Chelsea Clinton tweeting back and forth with the Church of Satan.
[02:52:48.729 --> 02:52:50.230]  California better hold on tight!
[02:52:51.391 --> 02:52:55.333]  Ice Director Promises Doubling Of Officers After Sanctuary Law Signed
[02:53:12.597 --> 02:53:18.458]  And it's criminal, and they're saying it's criminal and that Jerry Brown belongs in jail.
[02:53:18.458 --> 02:53:19.479]  Well, absolutely.
[02:53:19.479 --> 02:53:25.220]  I mean, California can't even float a budget, yet somehow they want to fund people that aren't even citizens.
[02:53:25.220 --> 02:53:29.621]  Green Day singer tells his Trump-supporting fans to F off.
[02:53:29.621 --> 02:53:30.781]  Okay.
[02:53:30.781 --> 02:53:37.103]  New York University hires white genocide professor who said massacre of whites was a good thing indeed.
[02:53:38.422 --> 02:53:53.451]  That's such a nice, loving, racist university up there at NYU, hiring the disgraced University of Drexel professor George Sicariello Maher, who is a white man.
[02:53:53.451 --> 02:53:54.851]  He's white.
[02:53:54.851 --> 02:53:58.974]  So, I don't understand, all these white people that hate white people, that want whites to die,
[02:54:00.370 --> 02:54:03.411]  I mean, I'm sure you can figure out a way of, you know, getting that going.
[02:54:03.411 --> 02:54:04.912]  I'll just leave it right there.
[02:54:04.912 --> 02:54:08.553]  Students required to pay for own social justice training.
[02:54:08.553 --> 02:54:16.756]  Oregon State University is offering students an $11.25 an hour job to promote social justice and cultural engagement on campus.
[02:54:20.558 --> 02:54:21.619]  Excuse me.
[02:54:21.619 --> 02:54:23.340]  Sorry.
[02:54:23.340 --> 02:54:35.089]  In order to qualify for the position, students must complete a two-credit course on, quote, foundations of social justice leadership, costing $490 for in-state students and $1500 for out-of-state students.
[02:54:42.248 --> 02:54:45.790]  Okay, so, hey, we're going to offer you this job.
[02:54:45.790 --> 02:54:51.893]  You're going to be showing students around campus, telling them about social justice and cultural engagement.
[02:54:51.893 --> 02:54:52.834]  Wow, it sounds great!
[02:54:52.834 --> 02:54:54.134]  And you're going to pay me?
[02:54:54.134 --> 02:54:55.015]  Yes.
[02:54:55.015 --> 02:54:57.796]  But first, we're going to need $500 if you're in-state and $1,500 if you're out-of-state.
[02:54:57.796 --> 02:54:58.497]  Here's an idea.
[02:54:58.497 --> 02:54:59.297]  Scrap the entire thing.
[02:54:59.297 --> 02:54:59.617]  You're insane.
[02:55:06.656 --> 02:55:13.118]  UK healthcare system cracks, creaks under pressure as never before.
[02:55:13.118 --> 02:55:20.521]  So, they've got this huge outbreak right now of the flu and all other things going on because guess what?
[02:55:20.521 --> 02:55:23.922]  Global warming isn't happening in Europe either.
[02:55:23.922 --> 02:55:27.683]  And they're freezing over there, so they're having all these health problems.
[02:55:27.683 --> 02:55:30.744]  But the problem is, the government-run healthcare can't afford it.
[02:55:33.305 --> 02:55:35.607]  Government-run healthcare failing.
[02:55:35.607 --> 02:55:38.049]  Tell me if I haven't heard that story before.
[02:55:38.049 --> 02:55:39.850]  So now they've got huge lines.
[02:55:39.850 --> 02:55:41.191]  You can't even see a doctor.
[02:55:41.191 --> 02:55:44.694]  If you're scheduled for surgery, they just postponed your surgery.
[02:55:44.694 --> 02:55:49.538]  That's what government-run healthcare is doing in the UK.
[02:55:49.538 --> 02:55:54.021]  How about this story on Infowars.com from Mikkel Thelen.
[02:55:54.021 --> 02:55:59.365]  Company harvesting human body heat to mine cryptocurrencies.
[02:55:59.365 --> 02:56:02.788]  Dutch startup emulates the matrix by utilizing human energy.
[02:56:03.834 --> 02:56:08.016]  The Institute of Human Obsolescence.
[02:56:08.016 --> 02:56:09.376]  Is that real?
[02:56:09.376 --> 02:56:19.940]  A business venture based in The Hague, Netherlands, since 2015 has utilized specially designed body suits to turn excess body heat into digital currency.
[02:56:19.940 --> 02:56:24.902]  A single human body at rest radiates 100 watts of excess heat.
[02:56:24.902 --> 02:56:28.683]  And apparently they turn that into cryptocurrency.
[02:56:28.683 --> 02:56:31.024]  Boy, that doesn't have a dystopic feel to it at all.
[02:56:32.229 --> 02:56:40.435]  But at the same time, why isn't every liberal on earth sleeping in this bed every night?
[02:56:40.435 --> 02:56:42.537]  Oh, maybe it's because it causes global warming.
[02:56:42.537 --> 02:56:43.277]  Maybe that's what it is.
[02:56:43.277 --> 02:56:44.278]  I don't know.
[02:56:44.278 --> 02:56:45.259]  I'm trying to figure that one out.
[02:56:45.259 --> 02:56:47.180]  You'd think that that'd be sustainable.
[02:56:47.180 --> 02:56:50.683]  And you know how much they love sustainable energy.
[02:56:50.683 --> 02:56:51.824]  Report!
[02:56:51.824 --> 02:56:55.727]  Scientists find Alzheimer's treatment while trying to cure diabetes.
[02:56:55.727 --> 02:56:58.028]  So they think they just had another breakthrough.
[02:56:59.059 --> 02:57:06.248]  In not a cure for Alzheimer's but something that can certainly treat the devastating effects of Alzheimer's.
[02:57:06.248 --> 02:57:13.456]  So that's great news and hopefully we actually get access to that as a public and we can turn that into something good.
[02:57:15.078 --> 02:57:23.482]  Woman, 67 years old, who battled blood cancer for five years, recovers after treating it with turmeric in the first recorded case of its kind.
[02:57:23.482 --> 02:57:25.302]  I doubt it's the first recorded case.
[02:57:25.302 --> 02:57:28.624]  There's been a lot of cases of people beating cancer without the chemotherapy.
[02:57:28.624 --> 02:57:31.065]  In fact, chemotherapy actually just speeds the whole thing up.
[02:57:31.465 --> 02:57:34.948]  Space station set to hit Earth is packed with cancerous chemicals.
[02:57:34.948 --> 02:57:36.749]  A Chinese space station is about to hit Earth.
[02:57:36.749 --> 02:57:39.712]  It's got all kinds of toxics and cancers on there.
